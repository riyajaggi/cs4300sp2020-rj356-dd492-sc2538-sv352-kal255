 I'm to inform the police have a suspect. He comes from wealth and privilege. ♪ Van Bergen is not our killer. The killer is choosing victims who somehow remind him of his own background and upbringing, his own class. I almost believe you don't want the killer found. It's time to take action. The 400 are too important to this city to suffer the public humiliation of having one of their own arrested for murder.

Stevie, no one is implying that you're anything less than a young man, but we've an important undertaking that requires you to alter your appearance if it's going to work. It seems we might have convened at police headquarters, judging by how well-represented it is. Sir, we've asked you here because we've a plan that requires your participation. LUCIUS: Commissioner, I'm sure Miss Howard has informed you that Dr. Kreizler believes these murders are being committed based upon certain dates - of the Christian calendar. - Where is Dr. Kreizler? Making arrangements for this evening. - What's this evening? - The Feast of Ascension, sir. Dr. Kreizler is convinced the next victim will be taken tonight. We're intent on taking up positions around two of the disorderly houses in hopes that our killer will be compelled to reveal himself. You're talking about Van Bergen? We're talking about whoever is responsible for killing four boys since the new year began. What exactly is your method to be? We plan on using a decoy. You mean her? Him, Mr. Roosevelt. Stevie here is Kreizler's ward, and will be stationed in some well-traveled venue under constant surveillance. Am I right? We're going to require full reign to execute our plan, which means the police must not be involved. MARCUS: Nor informed, as it's certain they'll not stay quiet about it. LUCIUS: It will also be necessary to shut down all the boy brothels in the city save one. We've chosen The Slide... right here. But I cannot be party to... to this. The anti-reformers are already after my head without me appearing to condone the dressing of a child for the express purpose of... Sex. It pains me to think what your father would say if he heard you talk that way. Sex is but a 3-letter word, Commissioner. I trust you are in agreement with our plan? ♪ ♪ Detective Sergeants, you'll have your weapons at all times. Most assuredly, sir. ♪ God help us all. ♪ [FOOTSTEPS DEPART] ♪ Gentlemen, have you imagined the logistics of how we will be able to accomplish our task? We calculate it's best to break into 2-man teams, one on each rooftop. Our decoy will be on the street below in plain view. Hopefully, the killer makes contact, and we'll be able to move in swiftly. What are the teams? Marcus will take charge of Mr. Moore, and, uh... [INHALES SHARPLY] Well, Detective Sergeant? Miss Howard, I-I'm afraid this is no task for the weaker sex. ♪ Nor for, um...

The man we're looking for is some 24 to 35 years of age, and is likely to have a recognizable facial trait. Yeah, Mr. Moore said silver teeth. Possibly. He'll also likely offer to take you somewhere. To live in a castle. I know. SARA: The point is, you're to remain alert. And if you feel yourself in any danger, no matter who it is, you're to signal that you need help. - I'll be all right. - You remember the signal? Polish my shoe on the back of my leg. You mustn't hesitate. I know how to take care of myself. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE] How does he look? - Lovely. - [SCOFFS] All right, Stevie. Out you go. Quickly now. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [HEELS CLACKING] [MEN SHOUT INDISTINCTLY] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE] [HOOVES CLOPPING] [BELL JINGLING] Did you know egg creams have neither eggs nor cream in them? You mean the man gypped me? No, no, it's simply how they're made... chocolate syrup, carbonated water, and milk. It's rather a mystery as to why they're called egg creams. [CLICKS TONGUE] What happened to your hair? That was a wig. Oh. What are you doing in this neighborhood? I've come to tell you that it's important that you keep your window locked this evening. You're worried about Fatima's saint, aren't you? We've a suspicion that it may be tonight that he strikes next. You know, there are... some of us who don't even believe he's even human. Think he might be a... spirit. He's most assuredly human. Where do you call home, Joseph? I told you, I work at The Slide now. Um... I guess what I'm trying to say is, uh, how long have you been... Working? I don't know. Have you ever thought of doing something else? What do you do? Me? Well, I'm, um, I'm an illustrator. What's that? I draw pictures. And... people pay you? Yes. [SCOFFS] That's stupid. [GLASS CLATTERS] Joseph, please, just... keep your window closed and locked this evening. Tell the other boys to do the same.

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE] [LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE] May I ask you a question? [SIGHS] Why do you refer to yourself as a cripple? I'm afflicted with a congenital defect.

[BELL CLANGING] [CART RATTLING, HOOVES CLOPPING] [MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Perhaps I'm mistaken about the calendar. Laszlo, there could be any number of reasons why nothing happened tonight. Maybe the Feast of Ascension holds no particular meaning for him. Or perhaps by closing the brothels, we scared him off. Or I could simply be wrong... wrong about all of it. Maybe the killer was here. You just didn't know it. 17 men talked to Stevie tonight. Might have been any one of 'em. Stevie, of all the men you spoke with tonight, was there not one who evidenced something unusual about his appearance? No one with a silver smile? What if Van Bergen didn't appear because he's not the killer? [SIGHS HEAVILY] [SIGHS] So what do we do now? We wait for the next holy day. When's that? Nine days from now. Pentecost.

MOORE: Tell me, do you think bidding at auction allows for the same titillation as games of chance? Only for the losers. What do you mean? Well, for some, the pleasure is in the pain.

Why don't you and I take one together, Theodore? Just the two of us. Alice, why don't we take Mr. Moore and show him around? Mm. ♪ MAN: Look to me now, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Roosevelt. I've had a talk with our old friend Bishop Potter. It seems your alienist came by, inquiring about a member of the church. What member might that be? The one whose family helped get our dear friend the mayor elected... the very same man who appointed you President of the Board of Police Commissioners. MAN: And look to me. ♪ [FLASH EXPLODES] Wonderful. I have it. Take another one. ♪ Dr. Kreizler is conducting an investigation at my request. How he goes about it and to whom he speaks, I leave to him. I've been assured that the young man in question, the one you attempted to arrest, will soon be leaving the country and therefore no longer poses a threat to the children of the city. What about the children of other cities? MAN: Gentlemen? [FLASH EXPLODES] ♪ Do not betray your own kind, Roosevelt, or you'll find yourself with no job, no friends, and no goddamn future. ♪ [DOOR OPENS] SARA: Dr. Kreizler? [DOOR CLOSES, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] - Ah. Miss Howard. - Hello, Cyrus. Excuse me for letting myself in, but, Doctor, I've come to tell you about my plan. Given that our killer seems to prefer taking boys from inside their room, I've arranged to have Stevie stationed inside the brothel. I've convinced the Commissioner to help, although he'll not want it acknowledged. I'm afraid that wherever Stevie is placed may do nothing to help us find our killer. What about the Christian calendar? Just because it didn't work the last time doesn't mean that it won't work at all. Now that the killer has given in to his desires, he can't easily stop himself. - Isn't that your theory? - [CHUCKLES] I sometimes wonder what good my theories do. For the moment, they only occupy the bookshelves of other alienists. As I said, it's been arranged. For tomorrow. Yes. Pentecost. ♪ Oh, I'm curious as to where you'll put him, Gran. MRS. MOORE: I shall keep him in the parlor. That way, I'll have someone to talk to when you're out carousing. - Hello, Mrs. Moore. - Hello, Sara. That's a fine armadillo you have. Thank you. [CHUCKLES] Did you see what my grandson spent his money on? I spent it on the orphans, Gran. [STRAINED VOICE] I've hoisted anchors that weigh less. - [THUD] - A typewriter? I was hoping you might teach me how to use it. You? I once had aspirations of being a writer. I thought I might have another crack at it. I don't think that's possible. Oh, you think I lack talent? I think you lack dexterity. In your fingers, that is. All men do. It's why they'll never be any good at it. [CLACKING] - ROOSEVELT: Kreizler! - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] [HOOVES CLOPPING IN DISTANCE] There you are. I'm afraid you'll have to wait your turn. I'm here to let you know your actions have become conspicuous to some very important people. I'm sorry if they're casting a shadow over your good name. Don't worry about my good name. I know who my enemies are. I've been informed Willem Van Bergen is leaving the country. - Hmm. - [SCISSORS CLATTER] Do you not believe it? I told you, I do not believe he's the man we're looking for. You plan on another stakeout? With Pentecost tomorrow, I believe our killer will be compelled to act. He won't be able to stop himself. We must therefore take advantage of every opportunity offered to us. [FOOTSTEPS DEPART] What causes a man to do such things? Are we to consider him... mentally defective, a lunatic acting irrationally? Or is it possible he's as sane as you and I, and there indeed is... method to his madness? Those who are seen dancing are thought insane by those who cannot hear the music. [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] It's just a matter of finding a way to hear the music. Sara, would you like something to drink? I'll have a whiskey. No, thank you, Mrs. Moore. Why did she look at you like that? I quit drinking. I have the shakes to prove it. See? [CHUCKLES] Bravo, John. [SIGHS] Now I've something to show you. I was thinking about my father, which got me to thinking about Kreizler's theory about fathers, which got me to thinking about Kreizler's own father. That's a lot of thinking. Look at this. Ah, it's an old society column. I didn't know what I was looking for at first, but when I saw this, it struck me. You were looking for something on Kreizler's father? About Kreizler. You seem to be obsessed with the man. Perhaps you're in love with him. - Perhaps I am. - Hmm. Go on, read it. ♪ "Mr. and Mrs. Kreizler of 5th Avenue, recent émigrés to the city from Germany"... It's just a newspaper clipping from 30 years ago. Skip down to the second to last paragraph. "The evening was highlighted by young Master Kreizler, "who dazzled all with his interpretation of Mozart's 'Concerto for Piano No. 20 in D minor.'" I fail to see anything unsettling about a piano recital. Unless it's Mozart's "Concerto for Piano No. 20 in D minor." What of it?
