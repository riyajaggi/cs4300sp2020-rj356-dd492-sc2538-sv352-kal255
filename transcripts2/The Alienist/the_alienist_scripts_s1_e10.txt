  ♪♪ Moore: You weren't responsible  for her death. Who, then, if not me? This wretched investigation  is over. Dr. Kreizler's withdrawn  because he's been hurt, but we have a duty to go on. But we don't have the knowledge  or the know-how. We have a name.  We have a suspect. All we have to do  is find him. Still trying to be a detective, are you, Miss Howard? Get out of my way.

Where is he? ♪♪ [ Flashbulb pops ] ♪♪ [ Flashbulb pops ] ♪♪ [ Flashbulb pops ] ♪♪ [ Breathing shakily ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Has anyone seen  the Commissioner? [ Indistinct conversations  continue ] Excuse me, Commissioner. You should know that the body of the boy found in the bathhouse is being transported  to Bellevue. The mayor felt it would be better to have it there where it can be viewed  in peace. He's also concerned that your presence may... inflame the situation. When I was out West, I dreamed of returning  to New York one day... a hero... who rid the city of corruption, stopped murderers, not a bureaucrat  shackled to a desk. The last thing an honest politician can expect is gratitude, if I may quote you. We know his name. We know where he lives. We're close, sir. Not close enough. Man: Clear the way, please. [ Speaks indistinctly ]  Move along there. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Hooves clopping ] [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Hooves clopping ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Door opens ] [ Hooves clopping ] [ Door closes ] Joseph is still missing. He was turned out on the streets  because of me. I gave him money, but it never crossed my mind  to take him in. You're not to blame, John. Of course I am. God put him in my way, and I failed him  like everyone else. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Exhales deeply ] You know, until yesterday, I... I felt sympathy for Beecham. I thought I finally  understood him. We can't understand him, neither you nor I nor anyone. Not even your friend Kreizler. When you said that you were in love with him, did you mean it? I imagine I was teasing you. ♪♪ I think I'm in love with you. There you go again,  John Moore. I know it's embarrassing to speak of such things, that we should keep them  to ourselves and abide by the codes that keep us civilized, but how can we be civilized when we've experienced something like this? Turn me down, by all means... ...but don't pretend I have no feelings for you. ♪♪ [ Kisses ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Door closes ] Any news? John believes another boy  may be missing. And what about Laszlo? [ Children shouting playfully  in distance ] Kreizler:  I've made my life's work the study of the human mind.  [ Inhales deeply ] And yet now,  my own mind deceives me. [ Clock ticking ] I have cause to hate God  for what he did to her, and... Yet I find myself  believing in him... ...humbled by his awful mystery. [ Ticking continues ] [ Inhales deeply,  exhales sharply ] Forgive me. Forgive me, too, if I pried into matters that were not my concern. I only did it out of regard for you. [ Ticking continues ] [ Chair creaking ] [ Ticking continues ] [ Exhales sharply ] My father... ♪♪ My father had two sides -- ♪♪ ...one loving  and the other brutal, the two often coexisting. It was something as trivial  as putting me to bed, I recall. ♪♪ A game of tug of war.  We were laughing... ♪♪ [ Inhales sharply ] ♪♪ [ Inhales shakily ] I don't remember  if he was drunk or if I said something  that offended him. He must have pulled my arm  behind my back. [ Sniffles ] [ Stifles sob ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Voice breaking ]  In small children, fractures often affect... [ Inhales sharply,  exhales deeply ] ♪♪ My father kept a great deal  hidden from me... [ Breathes sharply ] ...which is why I'm overly inquisitive, I suppose. [ Breathing heavily ] As a child, I was unaware of my father's melancholia... ♪♪ But it became  so overwhelming that he tried to take  his own life. [ Inhales deeply ] I was the one who found him. ♪♪ At the last moment, he'd lost his courage... and tried to pull the gun from his mouth. ♪♪ He was in terrible pain.  [ Inhales shakily ] [ Whispers ] Half his face... ♪♪ He took my hand, and we held the gun  together... [ Cries softly ] ♪♪ I'm sorry, Sara. ♪♪ I've learnt from you we can either let it haunt us for the rest of our lives... [ Exhales shakily ] or we can accept it... [ Voice breaks ] and use the memory of our pain to help others. [ Inhales deeply ] ♪♪ I'm not sure the choice  is entirely in our hands. [ Whispers ] I disagree. If it weren't, we'd all be murderers. ♪♪ We were hoping you'd change your mind. ♪♪ [ Ticking continues ] Cyrus: Stevie, prepare  the carriage for Dr. Kreizler. That won't be necessary. I've not asked to be taken anywhere. I meant no offense, sir. Nor I, Cyrus, but I intend to walk. [ Door creaks ] ♪♪ Where was the body? [ Water trickling ] This is not where he  was killed. Not here. [ Shower running ] Describe the wounds. [ Inhales deeply ] Here. Here. A large cut? Gaping? Yes, sir. And the eyes? Were the eyes missing? No, sir. They was there. Pale from being in the water, but they was there... [ High-pitched ringing ] ...staring up at me, they was. I'll never forget it. [ Ringing continues ] ♪♪ [ Slicing sounds ]  [ Gasping ] [ Panting ] ♪♪ [ Faint crying ] ♪♪ [ Door creaks ] ♪♪ [ Smacks lips ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations,  rooster crows ] [ Chickens clucking ] ♪♪ Dr. Kreizler. Detective Sergeant. ♪♪ Dr. Kreizler. Good to see you, sir. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Boy crying ] ♪♪ [ Metal clinking ] Much of the organic evidence was taken away for analysis. ♪♪ [ Boy whimpering and crying ] ♪♪ A chart of the city's sewage and water system. Beecham probably stole it  from the Public Records Office. Mm-hmm. We suspect Beecham knows  we're watching the rooftops, so he's using the sewers  to get around. ♪♪ What is it? Water. Lucius: Yes, sir. We considered that since the Feast of John the Baptist is only 10 days away. You don't believe  there is a connection? Lucius: Not to the previous murders. ♪♪ Do you think it has a different purpose? No, I believe you're right. [ Clatter ] ♪♪ [ Clatter ] ♪♪ May I have a moment alone? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Marcus: A chart of the city's  sewage and water system. Lucius: ...the Feast  of John the Baptist is only 10 days away. [ Laughter ] Kreizler: Water. [ Voices overlapping  indistinctly ] [ Laughter ] [ Voices overlapping  and echoing ] Sara: ...intimate nature  of so many other aspects. [ Voices continue overlapping  and echoing ] [ Man shouting indistinctly ] [ Laughter ] [ Voices continue overlapping  and echoing ] [ Boy crying ] ♪♪ [ Whimpering ] ♪♪ [ Continues whimpering ] ♪♪ [ Door creaks open ] [ Door closes ] [ Continues whimpering ] [ Cat meowing in distance ] [ Whimpering ]  [ Meowing continues ] ♪♪ [ Cat meows ] ♪♪ [ Cat screeches ] [ Splat ] [ Insects buzzing ] Each of the murders  were committed within sight of a body of water,  like a river or a public bath. At first, I assumed  this map of the water system had something to do with him using the sewers to move around, but now I'm not so sure. "I baptize you with water, but someone is coming soon  who is greater than I am." Luke 3:16. John the Baptist. What of him? I believe it's why he took the name John, replacing George, but keeping the name  of the man who assaulted him. Beecham. We know heights are  important to him. The mountains are  where he found modest relief. But I'm beginning to think  that water, in the form of purification,  plays an equally important role in his morbid... His morbid what? Ritual. It's only a theory, but I believe Beecham  used this map to select the location  for his next murder. The Feast of John the Baptist,  it's six days from now. We don't have much time.  We need your help. Where to begin? High Bridge Tower. It's the highest point  in the city. [ Man shouting indistinctly ] [ Whistle blowing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] How much are they? [ Indistinct conversations ] Good morning, Marcus. [ Hooves clopping ] Esther. May I speak with you? I'm afraid my brother and I  are in a hurry -- I can wait. [ Indistinct conversations ] I didn't sleep with you to try and trick you or force you to look after my child. You know, I can earn  my own living. But what I don't want is to be alone for the rest of my life because a man I was foolish  enough to marry was too cowardly to face up  to his duties. I'm sorry for what happened  to you, Esther, truly. But I'm not ready to take care  of you or your child. I ain't askin'  for your charity. I'm only asking that you not cross the street every time you see me. ♪♪ ♪♪ Kreizler: ...the murders are in service to some kind of psychological gratification. [ Cups clattering ] Mrs. Moore: There you are, John. Laszlo was just explaining  the difference between a common murderer and a multi-murderer. Laszlo now, is it? Please tell me  you haven't come here just to frighten  my grandmother. [ Scoffs ] I'm not the least bit  frightened by these... psychopaths. Actually, John, I've come here  to invite you to the opera. The opera? Yes. the 24th.  It's "Don Giovanni." You are aware of  the importance of that day? It's the Feast  of John the Baptist. Once a Catholic... I'm afraid I have  a prior engagement with Miss Howard  and Commissioner Roosevelt. It'll keep me occupied  most of the evening. Perhaps you'd care  to join us? Perhaps after the opera. May I suggest we skip  the opera? Unfortunately,  that won't be possible. Our presence is required as a necessary prelude  to later events. How so? ♪♪ Certain "followers of my work" will expect us there. [ Crow cawing in distance ] Woman:  Lovely day, isn't it? ♪♪ Shall we say  half-past 7 then? [ Crying ] [ Sniffles, crying ] [ Gasps ] ♪♪ [ Crying ] ♪♪ [ Breathing shakily ] [ Whispers ] Oh... You're dirtier than a savage. She only loved me  when she bathed me. She washed me. [ Voice echoing ]  You deserve it. So pretty. Look at the little bird  in its nest. So pretty, I'm gonna  snip it off.  [ Whimpering ] [ Voice echoing ] You deserve it.  [ Gasps ] I love you so much. ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Knock on door ] ♪♪ I wanted to apologize. I'm sorry if  I was discourteous. Thank you. ♪♪ Okay. ♪♪ [ Speaks indistinctly ] ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Woman singing aria  from "Don Giovanni" ] [ Singing in Italian ] ♪♪ [ Laughter,  indistinct conversations ] John Schuyler Moore! Jack Astor. Rather underdressed,  aren't you? [ Opera continues in distance ]  Has it started? Oh, nobody bothers with Act One.  The fun only begins when Don Giovanni seduces  the ladies -- something with which you're quite familiar. If you're referring  to Julia Pratt, I believe you're  more familiar than I. Come on now, old man.  Let's have a drink. ♪♪ If I still drank, old man, I would prefer to drink alone  rather than with you. [ Scoffs ] [ Continues singing in Italian ] ♪♪ [ Man singing in Italian ] ♪♪ [ Woman singing in Italian ] ♪♪ Moore: I remain baffled as to why I'm attending the opera on a night as important  as this. Where are the others? Roosevelt's watching  Brooklyn Bridge, and Sara and the Isaacsons  are expecting us at High Bridge Tower. It's best we leave now. ♪♪ Laszlo, we've got to go. [ Men shouting indistinctly ] Come on! Hyah! [ Indistinct shouting  continues ] Sara: Detective Sergeants. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Hooves clopping ] ♪♪ Whoa, boy, easy, easy. -Man: Oh! Whoa now!  -Man #2: Whoa now! Whoa! ♪♪ They're all out there  tonight. The guardians  of the social order. Box 16. [ Opera continuing faintly ] You meant it when you said certain "followers  of your work." ♪♪ Byrnes. ♪♪ [ Ticking ] ♪♪ Lucius: What did Mr. Moore  tell you exactly? [ Whispering ] That he and Dr. Kreizler would join us just as soon as they could. ♪♪ [ Playing "In quali eccessi --  Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata" ] There's still time. [ Singing in Italian ] ♪♪ He's not taken his eyes off us. ♪♪ [ Continues singing in Italian ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Water trickling ] [ Playing "Don Giovanni!  A cenar teco m'invitasti" ] ♪ Don Giovanni! ♪ ♪ A cenar teco ♪  [ Whimpering ] ♪ M'invitasti... ♪  [ Whimpering ] Would you kindly see if there's  anyone in the corridor? ♪♪ [ Singing in Italian ] ♪♪ ♪♪ -There's no one.  -Excellent. ♪♪ [ Don Giovanni  continues singing ] ♪♪ [ Breathes sharply ] [ Singing in Italian continues ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Explosion ]  [ Screams ] [ Lowered voice ]  Now, John. Let's go. [ Explosions continue ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Horse whinnies ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Sara: When Dr. Kreizler  visited Beecham's rooms, what did you discuss? I told him about the eyes, the heart in the box. Was there anything else  he seemed interested in? Man: Hyah!  [ Rattling ] This isn't the right way to the High Bridge Tower. We're not going to High Bridge. The map of the city water system. Do you have the map  with you? Sara and the Isaacsons are waiting for us there. Half the city's police force is staking out the place. Then they shall be  disappointed. What the hell are you  talking about? He didn't take the eyes  this time. Conscious or not, his focus  was on something else. He's changing.  The ritual is changing. ♪♪ Kreizler: Think, John. What did you find  in his rooms? A map? The map on its own  tells us nothing. The box with  the child's heart. Not a child's heart. Someone older,  someone close to him. His mother.  It's not only love that resides in the heart, John. It's pain. ♪♪ I'm going to see if I can find out what's happened to them. You made me lie to them.  I had no choice. If the police were to get  their hands on Beecham -- But Roosevelt trusted you.  We all trusted you.

Moore: What does that prove?  That he wasn't insane? It proves we don't know  anything. God works between the lines. [ Sighs ] Roosevelt: Just think  what you achieved, finding a killer with  no connection to his victims. I wonder how long  he would have stayed hidden. Somewhere inside, I believe  he wanted society to know he's its tormented offspring, a living reminder  of all the crimes we commit behind closed doors. What matters is you stopped a monster. We set out to find a monster, but all we found was  a wounded child. ♪♪ Forgive me, but... [ Sighs ] I'm exhausted. ♪♪ I know how badly you wanted him alive. The Jesse Pomeroys  and Japheth Durys of this world will take their secrets  to the grave. But there will be others,  I have no doubt.

And to do good. ♪♪ [ Hooves clopping ] [ Horse blusters ] [ Church bell tolling ] [ Bell continues tolling ] [ Flashbulb pops ] ...and although Captain Connor  was no longer serving with  the Police Department, his adherence to the moral code  he once devoted his life to saw him act  in a most brave and... honorable manner.

But if we do, hell with you. Here's to me. [ Laughter ]  [ Glasses clink ] -Cheers.  -Cheers. [ Chair scrapes floor ] [ Indistinct conversations,  silverware clinks ] [ Lowered voice ] John. This was for Mary. ♪♪ I'll hope you'll find someone you can give it to. ♪♪ Thank you, Laszlo. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Cloches clank ] It's really over now,  isn't it? You sound disappointed. I've never had  an experience like this, and I wonder how many more  I'll be allowed. Somehow, I get the feeling you're done with people allowing you to do things. [ Kisses ] I meant what I said before. No, you didn't. You're in love with what  you don't have. You're in love  with your dreams. Aren't you? Yes. I suppose I am. Very well, then. I shall wait very patiently until you become Chief of Detectives. In the meantime, let me accompany you to a carriage. I'm perfectly safe,  thank you. Cab! [ Whistles loudly ] Man: Come on now.

[ Insect buzzing ] [ Horse blusters ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ In German ] I don't really know why I came. [ In German ] Maybe because now I'm free to speak my mind. I've always blamed my failings  as an adult and what you did to me  as a child. Those failings...  were my own. [ Indistinct conversations  in distance ] I remember something you once said to me. "Nature never allows a man to be more than he is. Only less." ♪♪ For years, I believed those words reflected your own bitterness  and failure. But now I understand there were for my benefit. You were simply preparing me for what you knew would be a life of disappointment  and pain. But you were wrong. ♪♪ I know that now. ♪♪ I still believe we can be better than nature intended, even if you can't. ♪♪ You did the best you could. ♪♪ Goodbye, Papi. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
