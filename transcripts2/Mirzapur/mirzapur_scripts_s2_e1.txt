 Come on! Fixed them proper. Munna Bhaiya! Munna Bhaiya is a rockstar. Life oughta be lived like this! Otherwise, hell, even the hair on your balls is alive. Who's the lawyer? Ramakant Pandit. Hello, Auntie. So, the thing is, you won't meet the groom's family again. Motherfu...

 Motherfucker! What if you're not home the next time Munna goes over? That's a risk. And what if the next time Munna Bhaiya comes over, he doesn't return alive? That's a risk too, Kaaleen Bhaiya. Will you work for me? The two of you can't possibly be my sons. I want you to expand the gun business. You have a free hand. Earn what you can with these. But remember... keep the guns firing. There's bloodshed in Mirzapur. Clean up the city.

 Rati Shankar had always been conducting minor attacks. But now he has gone after Munna and then me. F, G, H, I... J. You could've lived had you bothered attending school. I don't want any part of this... business. I want Mirzapur, Sharad. You have Jaunpur. Isn't that enough? You rule over Mirzapur, the throne of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Where is my money, Tripathi? The elections are almost here. I want greater quantities of "silk". I'm... about to come. No! You leave me panting like a bitch in the heat every time. Kaaleen Bhaiya never lasts this long. This is Maqbool's nephew, Babar. Keep him with you, show him the ropes. If you've taken up responsibility, fulfill it faithfully. Your son is an idiot. That he's an idiot is unimportant, What's important is that he's my son. Contribute generously to the campaign... after we win, I'll get the chief minister to hand you Mirzapur. I need more money. If you support me now, I'll help grow your business. When will you become the chief minister? Will you stop dancing if I become the chief minister? We've put down a deposit on an apartment. It's in Papa's and your name. Munna Bhaiya will be king of Mirzapur one day. And his bride will rule over the town. What's the plan, sir? To eliminate, Sinha. Start with them. I'll make you tea with my own hands someday. You'll be careful, won't you? With myself, and you. - Motherfucker! - Hey! Sweety is my love. - What do you guys want? - What is this? What the hell are you doing? Stop the car or I'll shoot. You're my best friend, aren't you? Your friend Compounder tried to kill me. I think we should send Dimpy away to Lucknow. Mirzapur isn't safe anymore. What the... Listen, lay low for a few days. Get out of Mirzapur. Bravo! I think I just creamed my pants. Sir, I have another client. Join me. Together, we'll rule Mirzapur. My men... don't touch a hair on someone's head without my permission. Look, bhaiyaji... it felt right in the moment, so I did it. Are you angry because Compounder tried to kill your father or because he failed? I want Mirzapur, Sharad. When Guddu and Bablu signed up, they said that they'd come together or not at all. So, they'll go out together too. And so begins the dance of destruction. I know about you and Raja. Only the Tripathi seed will fall into you. It's time to punish your partner-in-crime. Chop it off. The Akhanda you met... was a businessman. And I am... a don. Shabnam! You're here? Hey, dumbfuck uncle! Get some rest. Or I'll ensure you rest in peace. Munna! This is my daughter's wedding reception. I don't remember receiving an invitation. Motherfucker! Guddu! Ms. President doesn't know how to fire a gun? Fuck off! I'm pregnant. Guddu... Munna! Munna! Munna! Not Bablu! Please! Ah, eyes wide open now? Watch this! So, Guddu Bhaiya... Asshole! I'll kill you. I'm going to kill you in cold blood. Motherfucker! I'm not going to die. I won't die. Shoot me all you want... I won't die. No matter how deep the fall... I won't die. I won't die. Motherfucker... Munna Bhaiya. Munna Bhaiya. This is Kaaleen Bhaiya. Motherfucker... I will destroy you. All you motherfuckers... Munna Bhaiya. His mother... is your grandmother. Right, Bauji? Right? Guddu... What happened to Guddu, Papa? Son, get better. Then we'll talk. After so many days... you're finally conscious. Maqbool. What happened to Guddu? We found his car in the jungle. Completely burnt. That place is crawling with wild animals. We can't be sure. I've got men searching for them. Where's Beena? She's still ill, sir. She's had some medicine and is sleeping. One person pops some pills to wake up... the other pops some to fall asleep. This is a strange house. Don't worry, Akhanda. Let her rest if she is unwell. You gave me such an important job for the first time, Papa. - And I... - You did well. But I didn't finish the job. I wanted to make you proud. If you do what the family wants you to do, you'll make us even more proud. I will, Bauji. I definitely will. Even death doesn't scare me now. Maqbool. Send an offering to the Vindhyavasini temple for Munna. Death doesn't scare him anymore. Fuckin' hell. Bauji. Hey, you wait here. What happened to Pankaj? He didn't survive, bhaiyaji. Got shot in the chest. And you survived, motherfucker? The bullet only grazed me. Count them. Okay, bhaiyaji. One. Two. Three. Four. Motherfucker, don't count the next one. That's my asshole. I'm not stupid, bhaiyaji. I know the asshole well. You have threatened to hurt it many times. Bhaiyaji, five. Five bullet holes... but I still didn't die. I'm no less than a fucking Bollywood hero. Nobody can kill me. I'm... immortal. Immortal. I'm worthy. - Long live... - Shukla Bhaiya! - Long live... - Shukla Bhaiya! - Long live... - Shukla Bhaiya! - Long live... - Shukla Bhaiya! - Long live... - Shukla Bhaiya! Thinking of Papa? So, you did become the don of Jaunpur. You didn't want to get mixed up in all of this, right, Sharad? That's what I wanted then. But this is my destiny. Papa's legacy can't be that... two goons shot him openly and got away. Until I change that... I'll be here. You'll have to take over Mirzapur for that. That's what your father wanted. Victory is certain only when... victory and defeat... are both within your control. Mr. Lala, we had some questions. At your daughter's reception... do you recall anything more from that night? I have no clue who those people were. Have you found out anything? Haven't found any witnesses yet. If we learn any new information, we'll inform you right away. And if you discover anything, let us know. You do know who Munna is. So why didn't you tell them? If I tell the police... they'll stick their nose in... and sniff out our opium. It's risky. Wait till the time is right. We'll sort it our way. Be patient, Yusuf. Easy for you to say, Lala. It was my son who died. Those who have left us are not the ones who suffer. The suffering is for those who are left behind. Sita and Gita watched silently. But they didn't utter a word. Run! Run! Come on! Hurry up, come on! I will strangle you, motherfucker. - Open the lock. - I won't let you go! - Is it open yet? - Get the gun. I've caught Munna! What are you doing? Give it to me! Dimpy! Golu! Fire the gun! Golu fire! Stay away, Bablu! I've got it! Guddu Bhaiya! - I won't let you get away. - Let him go! I'll hang your naked corpse in the middle of Mirzapur - or I'll change my name. - Let him go! Leave him, Guddu Bhaiya. - I'll piss on your face. - Leave him! Understood? I'll piss! Quiet! - Dimpy. - Be quiet. Fuck this asshole. Bastard, I'm trying to heal you and you're throttling me. And who is this fucking Munna? Because of whom I would've died. Show me his damn face! Does he look like me? Almost done. Asshole. Give me water. My throat is dry. Wait a moment. He was mumbling in pain. I went to check on him. And he pounced on me. And you don't even leave the fucking light on. He's always itching to get up and leave. If you have to tie someone up, tie him, not me! He's a fucking madman. I'm telling you, I'll poison him someday. Nobody will know. Are you done? Or are you going to babble some more? I need to piss real bad. Won't be able to hold on much longer. I'm warning you! And you? Can't you remain calm? Don't you want to get better? Listen, I'll wet myself. I don't want to get better. I want revenge. Give me your hand. Why aren't you telling me where I am? I'm talking to you. Why aren't you telling me? My bladder's gonna burst, let me pee. Take me to Mirzapur. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her! I want to go to Mirzapur. Take me there. Let's go! I'll kill every one of you! I want to leave this place! Let's go! Now! Now! Now! It's alright, I've stopped it. Get up and go to Mirzapur. Who's stopping you? I'll tell you what... First... pick this up. Come on. You done? Everybody who's lost someone wants revenge. But you need to be strong enough. We've got your injections. Take them. Go to sleep. Have your medicine. It'll help with the fever. Only then can you attend to me. The lion... has tasted blood. And now he's hungry. He wants to taste the doe's warm flesh again. I want you to recover, that's why I've got you the medicine. Have it. CHIEF MINISTER'S OFFICE GOVERNMENT OF UTTAR PRADESH Today's Aam Darbar's coverage should play on every news channel for the next two days. Nonstop. Understood? Yes, sir. Come! You called, brother? Yes, we'll talk. Be patient. This is the party's work too. Bravo! Anand... the park is looking great. Yes, sir. If a park can have elephants, why can't it have mangoes? Absolutely, sir. When does the work start? This month. I wanted to talk to you about something important. Yes, tell me? Brother, she's a party worker with me. In private, JP. Brother, she's part of the party. Feel free, go on. Motherfucker. This is why I said I wanted to talk in private. Did you enjoy getting humiliated in front of her? Where are you going? Please stay. If you don't see the inner workings of the party, how will you manage it? You're a first-class moron. If you weren't my younger brother, I'd stick you up a pole and have you hoist the fucking banner. On minimum wage, because that's all you deserve. What did I tell you? No violence. I told you, didn't I? But your people decided to piss right out in the market square! In all other weddings, DJs entertain guests, but here in UP, gunfire entertains them! Brother, I told them... But nobody gave a rat's ass! The party's reputation has been stained. Understood? And before the election, I want us to look pristine. Can you manage that? Or will you come crying to me again? It'll be done, brother. Let's go, Anand. TRIPATHI MANSION Every jungle has its own laws. And every animal living there has to follow them... except of course, the Lion! Lala fucked it up, Papa. Otherwise, I'd have shot Guddu too. Sit down, Mr. Gupta. Sit, we need to talk. I understand your pain. How, bhaiyaji? How will you understand my pain? I'm not just a don, I'm a father too. I understand the love for one's child. My child died, not yours. Why? Why did you kill my Sweety? What did she ever do to you? Nothing, I loved her. That's why I killed her. My sorrow is greater than yours, Gupta. You have another daughter. I just had one love. Munna. Where's your other daughter? Any news on her whereabouts? Look... one didn't survive, it's important that the other does. What's done is done. The guilty... had to be punished. Keep looking for her. Constable Lakharam. PSI Arun Sharma. PSI Amit Rathod. Sir, I want to... join you... in cleaning up Mirzapur. Just give me the power... and I'll dig their graves. Put your shovel back in to your pocket. There's no need to dig anything. You're a bit too late. Have you ever played on that thing... a see-saw? Up-down, down-up. When you were flying high, you wanted to drag me down. Now that you're down, I've gotten off. I'm not playing anymore. I don't understand. I'll explain. Have some ice cream. He killed my entire team, right in front of me. If he'd killed me, it wouldn't have changed a thing. My wife would've gotten a cheque. The usual. Seeing all this... I don't have the courage anymore. Your family has been destroyed. I don't want to destroy mine. This department will continue the way it always has. Understood? Yes, hello? I'm safe, don't worry, on my way. Eat the ice cream and calm your mind. You sound happy. Guddu proposed to me, of course I'm happy. Didi, how are you so sure about everything? Like this marriage. I'm sure because I think with my heart. Not like you, always with the head. But thinking with the heart, it's risky. You keep saying. "One man's good is another man's evil." I like to go with the flow. The tea is actually quite nice. Did Bablu teach you? Didi! - What are you... - I have an idea! All four of us can get married. They've both fallen asleep. You should sleep too. I'll keep watch. Sometimes, I wonder with Dad's help, could we have stopped Guddu Bhaiya? You know... none of us have cried yet. What happened? Shall I start, bhaiyaji? I'll talk to them. Is the liquor business doing well? Yes, sir. It's going well. - Any trouble from the police? - No, sir. Nothing at all. So, Chadda's commission and my payment will continue? - Absolutely. - Absolutely, sir. Good. Sir, these two... Olandganj and Jaycees Chauraha. Neither of them pay your commission. Your father tried to make them understand. Shall we finish them off? You guys don't plan on paying up? We never paid your father, as for you, you are still just a child. Chadda. You won't supply them with liquor anymore. Sir, I'll suffer losses. No, you won't. That supply will go to these two. But, sir... where will we sell it? The demand isn't that high in our area. Sell it on their turf. Olandganj. Jaycees Chauraha. And I don't want any commission from those sales. Undercut the extra profit, sell the liquor for cheap. And if there's any trouble between you all, figure it out, don't come to me. The supply won't stop, that's my guarantee. What the fuck? Do you think we're idiots? This is the business. Whoever owns the liquor owns the turf. And the profit. I'll fuck you up right here. Move it, motherfucker. Hello? Mr. Sharad. Yusuf Zadran speaking. Go ahead. I wanted to talk to you about Munna Tripathi. Wanker Lalit. Wanker Lalit. Wanker Lalit. Bhaiyaji. Cheers! Wanker Lalit. Hey! Shall I show you something amazing? Yes, bhaiyaji. Turn around, fucker. Oh, son of a bitch. Anaconda! - Isn't it mind-blowing? - Yes, bhaiyaji. I'll tell you something. Yes. There's not a lot of difference between a man's penis and his gun. What? How? They're both considered weapons. Yeah. When you hold either in your hand, your mind just shuts down. Okay. And when you fire them both, it's fucking fun. Yes, bhaiyaji. Here, try it. In the room? On me. Come on. Didn't I tell you no one can kill me? Bhaiyaji... Fire it. Told you I'm immortal. Bhaiyaji... Motherfucker, I said, fire it! It was empty. Motherfucker, I'm immortal, not a moron. Yes. Then, son, why are you being moronic. Come bathed and ready early tomorrow. There's a prayer ceremony for your long life. Fuckin' hell. Immortal. I'll get the food. Beena. Bring your feet forth. God bless you. You seem better, Beena. I'll get the food. Maqbool. Get me some turmeric. Please go ahead, bhaiyaji. Bauji, Lala won't supply us with opium anymore. We need to increase our gun profits. Okay. We'll do that. After all, I handle the guns. How will you increase it? No, I mean... I haven't figured it out right now. But I will. Be patient, Munna. If I need your advice, I'll ask you. Don't strain your brain. You don't use it often, so it's rusted away. Eat. Nonsense. Are you done? Slurp-slurp nonstop. You've already gulped down 4 bowls. Just get a bucketful and bathe in it, why don't you? Go on, the ceremony is over. Fuck. Bauji, since Rati Shankar died, Jaunpur is vacant. Sharad seems to be taking over. He's smart, educated. Could attack us at any moment. Perhaps we should make the first move. If you take Jaunpur... every don in Purvanchal will know that the Tripathis remain as powerful as ever. Guddu and Bablu's departure makes no difference. Throw this out. I'll cook. Instant noodles are not proper food. They make me constipated. Hey, listen. Can you make some rotis? Make some for me. Whether you guys kill me or not, these fucking noodles will... Uncle, here they are! Been robbing the entire town at gunpoint. Move back. Move. Oh, motherfucker. This is Guddu Pandit, no? Hey, you! Haven't told anyone else, have you? No, sir. I came directly to you. I figured you'd give me the reward. Came here for a raise, and hit the jackpot. Kaaleen Bhaiya will be pleased. Come on, pick him up. Go on. His leg is injured. Come on, help her. He's a bodybuilder. We can't lift him. You, help them. Have you come here for a free feast? Come on, lend them a hand. I'll definitely lend a hand. I'll help lift him. I'm just helping. If it bothers you so much, lift him up yourself. Guddu Bhaiya! - What about him? - Brother, wake up! The fewer the witnesses, the better. He's temporarily silenced. - Bhaiya, open your eyes! - Let's make it permanent. Bablu! Asshole! Motherfuckers. Brother! Let it go! Got fucked in the ass, motherfuckers. Fuck, I'm definitely going to get AIDS now! Fuck this shit. Motherfucker! What the... You little... Bitch! Fucking whore! I'm going to carve you up! Kaaleen Bhaiya will reward me, even for your dead body. Mr. Yadav... what brings you to Mirzapur? My balls have been busted, Tripathi. That's why I've come here. And now it's your turn. What am I, Tripathi? Am I a child? That I'll come here and talk to you, and return waving your empty promises. I am a politician. Making a fool of people is my job. Instead, you've been playing me for a fool. I told you, no violence. But, no! First you polished off Rati Shankar. And then you turned that wedding into a blood bath. At this rate, how the fuck will the party win this election? - Look, Mr. Yadav... - What? What? Quiet! Motherfucker. Just keep quiet. Who needs to win the election? And who needed the money? What business am I in? I don't sell beads and bangles. If we sell weapons, violence is bound to increase. And it might get out of hand. If you don't understand this... then I'm not playing you for a fool. You are a fool. Tripathi. Don't forget, you're my guest. And guests shouldn't misbehave. A wave of my hand from Lucknow and... You survive because I let you. We both survive because of each other. And the guesthouse you're seated in is in Mirzapur. That makes you the guest. Like you said, guests shouldn't misbehave. I didn't come on my own. Then? The chief minister sent me. And this isn't a request, it's an order. The government must look like it's doing something about the violence. And there are just two ways to do that. Either there is no violence. Or if there is any, the guilty be punished. What do you want? I want Munna. He's done all this, hasn't he? I won't apply Section 302. Just a sentence of a few years. I'm giving you 24 hours. After that, I'll pick him up myself.
