 Open the door! What's taking so long, man? What the... Yes, sir. What took you so long? Sir, I'd dropped off. Didn't you show him the papers? What's this? Sir, some idiot left a jerry can on top of the carpets. It toppled, wet the carpets, and they all bled color. Move it.

 If you'd opened up a second later, that guy would be dead. Can I use the computer now? You've been hogging it for ages. There's work to be done. Take it, man. You owe me one. Guddu. You can feel the electricity, can't you? I'm gonna rip Mirzapur's ass apart. Guddu, my boy. Hmm? Every motherfucker is gonna shit his pants. We're not supposed to wipe out the town, just scare them into buying more guns.

 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Is it fixed, mister? - How much longer... - Sweety! For you. What's this? Open it and see. Am I late? Nah, it's fine. Rajan Mishra? Hmm. I'm Bablu Pandit, this is Guddu Pandit. Usman the butcher must've called you. Hmm. Business has been down in Mukeri Bazaar for months. Why's that? It's just bad luck. I seem to get all the fraud guns. They explode or get jammed. The customers keep returning them. And then I gotta return their money. Nothing I can do. My wife. Been married two years. Have some! Sorry, we don't have traditional sweets so she's just served sugar. Who's in the family? Mum and dad... No, not yours, your wife's family. She's from Jaunpur, no? Your brother-in-law too, right? Hmm? Yes. Right. We got a hold of your call records. You must really love chatting to your brother-in-law. Nothing wrong with that. Once a week, he delivers a trunk and takes one back. What's in those trunks? It's just household stuff. These guns seem perfectly fine. So, he gets you fraud guns from Jaunpur and you sell our good guns to him. You profit at Kaaleen bhaiya's expense. You have to choose n... Wha... What have you done?! Too much banter, too little time. Kaaleen bhaiya has given us guns... G-Guddu bhaiya, leave them alive. Wait for me outside. Please, my baby. You let them go? Yeah, and I got this. What's this? Breast milk, remember? Made a deal with her, she keeps pumping it and I let them live. Gupta! Mail this. Okay. And give me the receipt. That I will. But, Mr Pandit, this is Mirzapur. You can send all the letters you want, but nothing's going to change. That's the end of the ritual, here are the offerings. You too. Bless you. Bless you. Bless you. Bless you. Well, what do you think? Sir, we'll have to upgrade, restructure the deals with the gun distributors and update the standard operating procedures. It's the only way the business will grow. Anything else? Yes sir, hire women and children. Huh? They don't smoke, less of a hazard. The women will finish their work on time too, they'll want to get home to their kids and chores. And we should put up a clock. Shift changes will be more efficient. Hello. - As salaam alaikum. - Wa alaikum salaam. This is Maqbool's nephew, Babar, keep him with you, show him the ropes. Sure. He's useless, couldn't even handle school, dropped out. Maqbool, family is family, however disappointing they may be you must support them. Listen up, boy. Yes, If you've taken up responsibility fulfill it faithfully. Loyalty is all that matters in this business. What was your suggestion for the gun distributors? We need to throw them a feast. Please stand for the hymn. Praise the Gods! Maqbool. Got them all? Yes, sir. Maqbool bhai, why is Kaaleen bhaiya seating us separately? You've been handpicked, for a special missive from him. What's that? In time... enjoy your meal first. Listen up, fellows. I've decided to implement a new system. From now on no distributor will get a gun on credit. Cash only. But sir, if we pay you in cash and these guys take cash from us every week... The police won't be taking money from you anymore. Sir! Guptaji, finish your meal. There'll be dessert afterwards, we'll talk then. Sir, what about the fraud guns? Usman bhai, we'll figure out something for those too. What a spread. Hope you had your fill, boys. Now you see, there's a problem. All of you have a Jaunpur connection. Mr Gupta, the dealers won't pay you protection money anymore. Kaaleen bhaiya's reputation suffers if anyone takes money from his men and is left alive. But, Kaaleen... Please rest assured, the men will handle this. You will get a fair share of the gun sales. Now, to celebrate our new deal let's bring out something sweet. Bablu. Singh... Shall I leave, sir? Full steam ahead! If you can imagine it, you can achieve it. Here you go. Take it! Take it! Sir, the guns might explode. You're head of quality assurance, Mr Upadhyay, they won't explode if you've done your job. Pick up one of the cheaper ones. Wait. You're right-handed, no? Why're you aiming with your left hand? How about this - pick another gun in your right hand. Let's test two in one go, much more efficient. Here, grab another one. Go on, aim. Sir... Go for it! If you use genuine truck parts they shouldn't explode. And yet they do, why? Hmm? Investigate thoroughly, you'll find the problem. And until you do, this is how we'll do our "quality assurance". Okay? Later, then. Motherfuckers, do you guys wanna have a go? Get out, beat it! I can't sell you the truck parts anymore. Can't grease my palm if I don't have fucking hands! The cuntflaps, they were making me test the guns. Thank you. Mr Pandit, how many more letters will you write? The violence is getting worse, the town will implode at this rate. Well, who'd know better than you? I hear it's your boys who're causing this whole ruckus. You're my friend, I've watched your kids grow up. I hope you can stop them. You know what I mean, right? Back again, Munna bhaiya? Do the honors then. Nice, come on, bro. You're gonna love this snack. Subodh! Do you want something to eat? Your friends must be hungry. No, Grandma, we're fine. We're discussing some business. You should sleep. Okay. Your grandma's really fucking cute. That's why I love her so much. They look expensive, Golu. Return them if it makes you uncomfortable. I'm not uncomfortable, I just... you won't get it until it happens to you. Guddu seems serious. I hope you are too. Otherwise he'll be heartbroken. I want to be serious, but what about Papa? If you are serious I'll talk to Papa. Whatever happens you know I have your back. Golu, duck. Two cream sorbets. So pretty. The earrings or I? The earrings, because of you. I'm a straightforward guy, Sweety. I gave you a gift, you accepted it. This is getting serious. So, I wanted to be honest with you. I'm a gangster. I have my own reasons for that, but if you wish to return the earrings do so now. I'll understand. I'm fairly straightforward too, Guddu. Why should I return the earrings? They suit me, you said so yourself. Guns don't scare me. Been around them since I was a kid. Just... you'll be careful, won't you? With myself, and you. So, you're saying I can wear the clothes right out of the machine? You need to dry them a bit, but this is the top-end model. Where's Dimpy? She's gone to a friend's for some notes. You know it's not safe here at night and you still... Don't worry, papa. I'd like to see someone lay a finger on Dimpy. Oh, yes, I'd forgotten she's protected by Michael and Sunny Corleone. Papa, please stop. We're just starting to enjoy the fruits of... And what will you do with all these "fruits"? At the end of day, you'll still be eating bread. Yes, but at least we can have it with chicken. I'm done here, sir. Have some please. You have it, should I pass you the chicken? Gonna hit 200 today. I feel strong. Pumped. 140, Oh man, don't start again. 142, 143, 144, 145,146, 147, These are Mirzapur's history-sheeters - kidnappers, chain snatchers, musclemen, thieves. Mirzapur's most notorious. Tell them. Sir, is there a problem? We make sure to give Kaaleen bhaiya the money along with our loyalty. You're loyal, that's why we've called you here. Look, our job is to make homespun guns and yours is to fire them. Right? If we stop making the guns, what will you fire? Fuck all? And if we don't fire them then what will you do after making them? Fuck all. Bravo! So, in order to survive we need each other. We want to increase the homespun gun production so you'll have to fire them more. We can only fire the guns we have and many of us don't even have guns. And if we solve this problem of yours? Well, then... Alright. Take your pick. But how do we pay for these? They're free. Take whatever you want. If this is not enough, there's always more. Earn what you can with these. But remember, keep the guns firing. Yes, sir. Also, it's possible that the police might apprehend you. But you won't be hassled, I promise you. Yes, sir. Later, then. Mirzapur is quiet these days go and make some noise. Just watch, sir we'll be celebrating Diwali soon. Let's go. Guns for free, something you just decided? What if it doesn't work out? Shouldn't you have checked with me first? Kaaleen bhaiya was in the loop, Munna bhaiya. Just be patient, I'm sure we'll get results. Right now, we've just increased the supply. Once they've tasted blood, their demands will increase, and so will our prices. You just tell the factory workers to get ready for overtime. Sir, these boys are ruining everything. I'm well aware, Usman. It's Papa's call so be patient. Yes, sir. I'll think of something. Okay. We'll speak later. Hey, Compounder. Hmm? The whole town is running amok with guns and you're still using that damn razor. Munna bhaiya, there is poetry in the razor's blade. The "khchh" when it pierces skin and flesh that's what makes the kill visceral; real. You're talking like a bloody lover. Just one, neat slice and the magic unfolds - spitting blood from his throat, his mouth frozen, unable to scream, the blood spattering in beautiful patterns, death becomes poetry; poetry becomes death. I need to piss. I'll be back. I'll come too. Bravo! This is true friendship, we even piss together. Hmm. Let's go. But... we'll each hold our own, eh? Ey, motherfucker. What the fuck, huh? Clean this. It's just some piss, man. Motherfucker. You trying to tell me what it is? No, no, you're overreacting. What did you say, cuntlicker? Munna bhaiya is overreacting? No, I... Go on, lick it. Hang on can't just piss on me and leave. Munna bhaiya, let's fuck him up. Here. Do it, do it. Be still. Be still, it's my first time. Hold him. Give it to me. I'll show you how... on his throat, and... You were right, Compounder about the poetry razor shit. Just give me the word and I'll give you another demo whenever you want it. I'm your friend a friend in deed. Time to piss. Listen, come here. You know what, Compounder? Yes? In all of Mirzapur, no one knows me better than you. Well, there was my mum... just you now. Don't ever fuck me over, man. Haseena, you lead the tranny gang, yeah? That's why I'm asking you. Take it, sir, I'm not stopping you. Dip your hand in here and take the money. Don't you know begging is illegal? Are we the only people doing illegal things in this town, sir? What about the rest, huh? - Wait, sir! - Why are you leaving? Hire me as a constable, I won't beg then, my pride matters to me too. Where are you going, motherfuckers? Cuntflaps. Oh look here, Sakina, Jasmine... Ah ha! Hello, Bablu bhaiya, Guddu bhaiya. Hello. You know us? Anything that happens in this town, we get to hear of it first, our network is solid. Of course we know you. Here. May God bless you. Come Jasmine, let's go. Here's 500. People recognize us now, eh... Mummy! Yes? What the... we got you a washing machine and you're not using it? I'm washing your father's clothes. Why? Because I told her to. My clothes will not go in that machine. Why are you behaving like this, Papa? No, no. This town might be yours but this house is still mine. Papa, we can't get into this every day. Just tell us what you want and we'll do it. You know what I want. That's impossible. At first we didn't have a choice but now we're enjoying it. Okay, listen... those curtains you liked? Hmm. Go buy them and tell Dimpy to buy some new jeans. I'll tell her I got them otherwise she won't take them. I wanted to talk to you about something. You know, the grocer we go to for our rations? I don't like the way he talks to me, there's a certain lack of respect. Shall we straighten him out? Do you have your gun? Alright. I'll get ready. Alright. I'll wear that saree. Yes. What are you doing, bro? She's Guddu and Bablu's mother, man. She has to be treated with respect. Yes, but you can just chat, why the gun? Ugh. Because I can. This is the good life. Well, if it isn't my favorite priestess... Hmm. Well? How's everything going for you, Guddu? I'm doing great. As for you, we'll know soon enough. Guddu! Guddu! Guddu, no! I'll smash all your fingers and put a bullet in your skull. Got it? I'm not that young, lanky Guddu anymore. My mother warrants respect. Hmm? Hmm. What the fuck is this "priestess" nonsense? You could've just told me, Mrs Pandit. I understand! I understand, Guddu bhaiya and your groceries for this month are free! For the entire year, free! Free for life! Hey, listen! Even after I die the Pandit household won't pay for groceries, understood? Anything else I can do, Mrs Pandit? How much for this? Guddu Pandit. Bablu Pandit. If you want to live in this town remember these names, arseholes. I'm telling you right now. Mirzapur will run at our command. Sir, you're bleeding us dry while handing out free guns to those goons. Just be patient, Usman. Your profits will multiply tenfold. My child! Get out. File an FIR for your measly stolen belongings? But... It's your life, and property, right? Be fucking responsible for it. Once fear grips this town it won't be just the goons who'll need guns. The innocent will need guns too. Guns for attack, guns for defence. We'll turn Mirzapur into America. Come on, give me the money. This month's crime rate has fallen, right? Since we don't report any crimes. I've been thinking, we should get Guddu and Bablu into the "carpet" business. They've done good work, the balance of brains and brawn is productive. May I say something, Kaaleen bhaiya? Hmm? Guddu and Bablu have shot up quickly. I think Munna is feeling sidelined. Munna is an idiot, to feel like that. After all, eventually the business will be his. Easy on the chillies next time, please. The government will ask us to account for every ounce of spice. Ah, you remembered, sir. Well, to get you to do something I know it won't happen without some ice-cream first. Ugh, strawberry. Step up from vanilla, my man. Try it. How is it? Mindblowing, sir. So, Maurya there's bloodshed in Mirzapur and with elections around the corner, Lucknow is panicked. The bosses have commanded you be sent to Mirzapur. Yes, sir. If you've got a cold, don't have it. Sir, we're policemen. What's a little sweetener here and there? Right then. Go, clean up the city. Off you go. Translate: ReTail
