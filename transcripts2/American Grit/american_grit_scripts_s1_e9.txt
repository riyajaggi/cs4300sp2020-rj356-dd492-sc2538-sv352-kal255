 Previously on this season ofAmerican Grit... Welcome to the toughest challenge of your life. I brought four decorated heroes of America's Armed Forces together to show the world what it takes to be the best of the best. - Go, go, go, go! - Make it hurt! Navy SEAL Commander Rorke Denver. I led assault teams all around the world. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Tee Hanible. I was the only female to deploy in one of the first units in Iraq.

 Army Ranger Nick "The Reaper" Irving. I killed 33 enemy combatants in 3 1/2 months. And Army Sergeant Noah Galloway. My Humvee hit a roadside bomb, and I lost my left arm and left leg. Each member of this cadre hand-picked a team of four civilians. - Let's go! - I want the lumberjack. Who doesn't want the lumberjack? And pushed them to their breaking point to measure their grit. - Suck it up! - It's all up in your mind. Let's go! Get down here now! We can go harder.

 Come on. Finish strong. And each week, some competitors prove that pain was only temporary, while others gave out under the pressure. I can't keep going like this. No! No! No! I slam doors to keep from slamming my fist in somebody's face. Eight have been forced to ring out, and now only eight remain. After losing WWE hopeful Cam last week... Team Nick is down to the sole brawn of Boston cop Jim. I am the greatest ever! Team Tee, the few and the proud, - and its only member, Tony. - Jump! Move! Team Rorke, rallying with roller derby mom Goldie, Marine daughter Haze, and world-ranked triathlete Mario. Figure out a way to dig deep. And Team Noah's army of three in lumberjack Mark, Olympic gold medalist David, and fisherman Clare. - Who's having fun now? - All right. In the end, only one team will stand victorious with their cadre leader by their side. Thank you for believing in me. Tonight... Keep digging! On the two hour season finale ofAmerican Grit... Greatness has nothing to do about winning or losing. - Go. - Teams will confront their most punishing and back-breaking Evolutions yet. - Go! - Let's go, Goldie. Good job. And the competitors that manage to survive... You got to go. Come on. Now. Pick it up. Let's go. Will face a final Circus like they've never seen before. Don't you drop that rope, you son of a bitch! The grand prize is on the line. Black out or win. There's no other option. Only one team can be crowned the winner and show the world that they have American grit. ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ All alone now ♪ We in the fire ♪ Gonna burn it down ♪ Get out alive ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh - Aah! - Oh! It's over! ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ Hey! Oh, my God. Cam. I'm the new Tony. Oh, sorry. I'm not gonna think about Cam. I have to think about saving myself and getting the job done. You gonna miss your little man? I am gonna miss Cam. Sorry, Jim. My strategy was for me to be on that platform to distract Cam. It hurts 'cause I feel like it worked. Do I feel bad that our mind game worked on him? No. I'm actually pretty impressed that the outcome was exactly what we wanted. So, congratulations. You're to the finals. Congratulations. You're all the way to the finals. - Congratulations. - Thank you. And the rest of us got to find out how to get there. - One more. - Five more tickets. - One more person gone. - Five more tickets - to the final Circus. - Five more tickets. Ultimately, we want to make Noah proud. We want to make ourselves proud knowing that we're working hard as a unit, and also the $250,000 is at stake. So, we hope to be the last team standing. Let's win this Evolution tomorrow. And then you don't have to worry about the Circus. I know. That's what I'm saying. Tear the roof down, Mario. - Ha-ha! Good morning. - Hey. - Hi, Rorke. - There he is. Today is target practice. Follow me. Today's the ninth Evolution, and we haven't won once, so today we're gonna have some fun, de-stress, and be ready to focus when we get to the task at hand. - Who is that? - Oh, yeah. Is that Reaper, Tee, and Noah? - Oh, yeah. - This is awesome! And this is what we're gonna shoot with. Aah! The deadly water balloon launcher. Yeah. This has been a long, hard road, so getting to do some target practice... This is gonna be fun. - Ready? - Ready! Aim. Fire. - Oh! - Awesome! - Fire. - Oh! - A little bit more left. - A little bit more left. - Little more left. - Fire. - Oh! - Oh, it's beautiful. - Coming for you, Reaper. - We gonna get you, Reaper. That's me. This is very creepy. What's going on, gents? - Wow. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. If you want to replace yourselves, go ahead. - Wait a minute. - Ready. Aim. As far back as you can. - Fire. - Oh! Hey, I think this team just blew themselves up. ♪ - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning. Oh, I am especially excited today, and so are you. As our numbers dwindle, the competition becomes more and more intense. Whoever makes it through this next Evolution and Circus will experience the most grueling few days of your lives 'cause you'll be in the finale of "American Grit." Only one team can win. The rest of you will be pushed to a breaking point, guaranteed. Mark and Goldie secured a spot in the finals of this competition, and the team that wins today's Evolution will also secure a spot in the finals. This is the Evolution to win, because we win it, nobody goes to Circus, and everyone on the team goes to the finale. Today's Evolution will be the most difficult and challenging you've seen until now. It's called Tired Out, and it goes like this. You'll race off to four different obstacles hidden in this forest. Obstacle number one is a tire shuffle. Number two, you must free a tire from a puzzle. Next, you must crawl through a mud pit, and finally, solve a puzzle affixed to a hitching post. After you traverse each obstacle, you will grab a tire of your team's color, which you must race back to the start/finish line and mount on your team's post. Teams must travel together. But one competitor will be responsible for getting and bringing back the tire from each obstacle. Jim, Tony, you guys will be doing all the work. The first team to bring back all four tires wins the Evolution. If you win the Evolution, you're safe from the Circus and you punch your ticket to the final round of this competition and a chance to win $250,000. Cadre, get with your team, form a game plan. Get in front of Team Noah at all times. Don't ever let them get in front of you. - Right. - It's just him, so he's got to do each and every obstacle by himself. So he is gonna truly be tired out. Let's do assignments first. You go in one. Gonna have you go in two for puzzle. Have you go three for mud pit. - Then back to you for four. - Okay. So, you're working both puzzles today. Goldie is not gonna be able to go as fast as Haze and Mario, so we should just take advantage of the stuff we know. Communicate well. Take time so you're not moving quicker than you can think through a problem, and work together, you know? I think if they do that, they'll be fine. You know what? I'm glad it's just me. Yeah. Because I don't have to wait for everybody following me. I'll be there to motivate and strategize with him, but it's gonna come down to how bad he wants it. Don't stress out, and just go into it and keep moving. I chose Clare to do the last two obstacles because Clare's really good with knots... Tying them and untying them. So, she's gonna take that one on. Green Team on three. One. Two. Three. Green Team! Competitors, at the ready. The Evolution course is five miles in total, so there will be a lot of running between obstacles. Three. Two. One. Go! - Let's go, Blue! - Let's go, Tony. Let's go. Come on, Jim. Come on, Jim. Right here, baby. Wait for them to come. Get it going. Grab it and go. Grab it and go. Grab it and go. Faster. Faster. Faster. - Faster. Come on. - Aah! One left. Go. Go. As a team, you must hustle all 12 tires through until the colored tire is first. - Slowing down on me. Come on. - Back through. Back through. Right there. Turn around. Let's go. Tony's got the advantage of being a single player because he don't have to wait for a team to complete the obstacle before you continue on. So, Tony's up front? There you go. Just like that. Followed by Team Rorke, followed by Jim in Team Nick, and then Team Noah. Grab and go. Come on. Now. Pick it up. Let's go. Come on. Come on. I can hear Nick in his scary Reaper voice. Pick it up. Let's go. Right now. Pick it up now. Let's go. Come on, Jim. Hurry up. I'm so glad he's not my cadre, 'cause I would have myself by now. Get through it. This is where we pick up. Right here. Come on, Jim. - Let's kill it. - Let's go. Let's go. Faster. We have to finish. Come on. We're going to finale, y'all. Come on. We got two left. Two left - and you are off to the races. - There you go. Jim and Tony are neck and neck. Both of them have only one tire left. Come on, Jim. Hurry up. Let's go. Go, go. Run, run. Come on. Get out of there. Go, go, go. Get out of there. Go. No, you're done. Hurry up. Tony is racing back towards the start/finish line, Jim on his heels. And look at this. Jim moves into first place. - Every second counts here. - Go, go. Looks like Team Rorke is in third place as they grab their tire and head back to the start/finish line. Go, go. Get it, get it. Team Noah has left the obstacle. All teams back on their way to the start/finish line. Who are we gonna see first? Jim up front. We got Tony on his heels. Team Rorke in the distance. Team Noah in the distance. Tire on the post. Get going. Tire on the post. Get going. Teams must travel together, Mario. Remember that. Teams must travel together. Got to wait for your team. Just stay together. Stay together. Keep digging. Hurry, hurry. Go. Come on. - Come on, Goldie! - And back out you go. - Got it. Go, go. - Let's go. Let's go. Jim is in first place, Tony right on his heels, and although Team Rorke was ahead of Team Noah, they are quickly falling into last place. - Mario? - Where's Goldie? Where's Goldie? Come on, Goldie! Goldie is not built or designed to run. Breathe deep. Breathe deep. I think she's a good pick for the puzzles. I feel like, you know, kind of just be like, "Hey, this is your job today is to work out those puzzles and we'll see how we do." So, the team's off to the next obstacle where they'll have to undo a puzzle to release the next tire. Doing these puzzles is perfect for me, because now I get to get some rest versus constantly running. Go get it, girl. Work smarter, not harder, Goldie. You got this. Only one person per team can solve the puzzle... There you go, Goldie. So, teammates must wait by the markers until it's solved and the tire becomes free. - Good job, Tony. - So, Tony has cracked the code and is first out of the second obstacle. He's racing back to the start/finish line. Team Noah's second out of the obstacle. They're racing back to the start/finish line. Team Tee and Team Noah are neck and neck as they fight for first place. Jim and Goldie are struggling with that puzzle. They got to unlock that tire and get back to the start/finish line. It's all you, Clare. Here we go. Team Tee and Team Noah at a dead heat as they hit the mud pit. There you go. Good job, guys. Come on. Dive in. Let's go. Get lower. Get lower. Get lower. Get lower. ♪ Let's go. What are we doing? I'm a little bit worried right now because Tony's had problems before with endurance and long distances. You're walking. Come on. Get back in there. - There you go, Clare. - Come on. He's gassed at this point, but I'm just telling him to focus, try to keep that pace that we talked about earlier. Push it through. Push it through, baby. Push it through. Let's make it hurt right here at the end. Come on. Now get up and run. Run, Tony. Pick it up, Tony. Pick it up, you need this. Meanwhile, at the second obstacle... There you go, Goldie. Right.. Now let's go! Let's go, Goldie. Good job. Goldie is out of the puzzle; she's got the tire. - Good job, Goldie. - Take deep breaths. It seemed like I was the first one on that tire puzzle, and then I was the last one out. That really frustrates the crap out of me. Three down. One to go. Come on, come on, come on. This is the last one. This is the last one. Go, go, go. Find it, find it, find it. Come on. Team Tee and Team Noah continue to fight for first place as they run to the final obstacle, passing Team Rorke along the way. Jim, the last surviving member of Team Nick, is lagging behind in last place. To the mud we go. Come on. Put it on. Let's go. - Tire up and in. - Here we go. Jim hot on their heels. Here we go. Get that tire on. Get back out in the mud pit. Win and you're in. Come on, now. Jim, you might be in last, but it can change quickly. You just got to keep with it. - Here we go. - Ah! The final obstacle is the farthest away. You need to run a mile there, solve the puzzle, and a mile back before you can win this Evolution. We have to pace ourselves, you guys. - Go easy on me. - Just talk to me. I'm hurting a little bit, but we just keep moving as a team. I mean, I'm 47 years old, and pain is one of those things that, you know, someone says, "Oh, are you sore?" I'm like, "I'm always sore." The pace now wearing on Tony as Team Tee lags behind Team Noah. This is where they excel. They are always efficient. You got it, girl. - Good job, Goldie. - Come on, Jim. - Just keep that head down. - Only a few feet behind. Hey, Jim, just crawl. Crawl through. - Get on your stomach. Crawl. - She's got it. She's got it, Mario. She looks good. Come on, Jim. We're just rolling. Go, go, go. Goldie, you can beat 'em on this puzzle. It's just mud. It's just mud. Come on, Jim. Come on, come on, come on. Now, go. Go back out. Back out. Last one. Let's go. Grab it and go. Over your shoulder, Jim. Over your shoulder. Perfect. - Oh, the hill! - Use that hill. There it is, Goldie. - All we've got, Goldie! - There it is. There it is. - Nothing left! - Here we go. Here we go. Don't listen. You got it. Just keep it going. Team Rorke has now joined Team Tee and Team Noah at the final puzzle. Oh, God. Please help me. The last obstacle looks simple, but it's not that easy. You got to break that tire free and race it back to the start/finish line. We got to get it, everybody! - Ugh! - Jim has finally reached the final puzzle. All teams at the fourth obstacle. I'm really happy to see every other team still fighting for this puzzle. I know I'm still in it; if I can figure this puzzle out, I could win this whole thing. The only thing preventing you from winning this Evolution and getting to the finale is freeing that tire. Still anybody's game, Goldie. You've got this. Jesus, please help me. ♪ Let it hang. Look at the problem. Yeah. Let it hang. Winning this Evolution gives each and every one of us a pass to the final Circus. This is the most important Evolution. This is one we want to win. I can generally figure out puzzles, but I think the key is that I'm gassed. My brain's not working the way it should. Tony's doing something a bit different. Looks like he's onto something. Just relax and think. You got it. You got it, Clare. Good job. There you go, girl. Working the knots. Working them angles. ♪ He solved it. Tony's tire is free. All he has to do is run it back. - Go, Tony. - Pick it up, Tony! - Win and you're in! - Oh, ! Let's go! Win and you're in! Come on, my man. - Buddy, pick it up. - Let's go, baby! Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Team Tee! Team Tee! Team Tee! Boom! Evolution over! - Whoo! - Oh, man. You are in the finals! You did this, baby. You did it. This one is for Tee and myself. We made it to the finals. I'm so stinkin' proud of you. She's pushed me harder than I've probably been pushed in a long time. It's nice to feel that love again of someone pushing you so hard that it's like, "You still got more. I know you got more." And I'm like, "I do. I do." - Don't die on me, though. - I ain't gonna die. - You still got tomorrow. - Ugh! Team Tee to the finals, baby. All the way. I was so glad when I saw you there. If I couldn't win, then I wanted to see Tony win. As long as someone beat Noah's team, I'm happy about that. Teams, gather around, please. Jim, you, as the sole member of Team Nick, will be facing the Circus. Noah, Rorke, very difficult decisions to make because you must choose a member of your team to face the Circus, and keep in mind: the members that you don't choose will automatically get a ticket to the finals. Tony might have won the Evolution, but all of you will get a reward. Your cadre have a very special surprise in store for you. Head back to base camp. We'll see you later on. Who's ready for a shower? True American heroes. It's because of them we can play this game. - That's true. - Right. Right. - Hey. - Hey. - Who's she with? - Okay, house, I want to introduce you to a close friend. This is Sergeant Major Robin Fortner. - How we doing? - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Sergeant Major Robin, she's headed up the Marine Corps Task Force on integrating females into combat roles, and she's always been instrumental in being a mentor for me. - Tony. - Hi. Nice to meet you, Tony. I think Robin will be able to help Tony. Give him some inspirational words and help inspire him to take him to the end. This is Jerry, a good friend of mine. He was my platoon leader my second deployment to Iraq. So, my other cadre members get to bring in a special guest as well. This is really what we need today. - Pleasure to meet you, Jim. - Paul, pleasure to meet you. Yeah. All right. So, you're the last survivor? I'm the lone survivor from Team Nick. Yeah. How many missions were we on like that where it's you and your rifle and you got to get it done, man? Yeah, the bond I have with Paul, it's one of those bonds that are forged in fire. Been so many times to where we didn't think we were gonna make it out, and having that mind-set brought to the table really is gonna, you know, impact Jim hopefully a lot. Me and Nick had fought our way through Marja' with the platoon we were attached to all night long, and about every 400 meters or so we were getting ambushed, you know, and it'd be rockets, and then it'd be machine guns, and then it'd be machine guns and rockets. These guys have fought the real battles... The life-and-death battles. It's an honor to meet you guys and to have worked with you all this time. - Yeah. - I read books about guys like you. You're everything I wanted to be. Appreciate it. I might cry a little bit there. - It's very humbling. - Don't cry yet. Not yet. - So, how you feeling, though? - I'm feeling good. You know, I've been fighting for a long time, so... - Fighting? - Yeah. Like, we were one of those teams that's like everybody's looking at, "We can get him out." Mm-hmm. - And we survived this long. One thing I notice that you keep saying "we," so you already got the right mind-set that you started as team and you're gonna end as a team. - Yep. - You've definitely overcome a lot of challenges, and I think we both can relate to that as well. - Yeah. That's true. - There's 7% of us are females, and we got to stand right next to our brothers so they see that it is possible and that it can happen. It's the few and the proud, I got that, but sometimes it's the fewest of the proudest at the same time. I was inspired to just watch two women take it to the max in the military. It made me feel like, "Yeah. "I can still take it to the max. "When you think you can't do it, Tony, do more. You can get more out of yourself," and that's what I'm gonna do. It was so hard today not to mention that it was the 10-year anniversary. I wanted to wait and say it tonight, and it's just a really special day for us. Jerry was my platoon leader on my second deployment to Iraq. He was actually in the Humvee when I got hit. He doesn't remember a thing, but we obviously went to Baghdad then went to Germany, and I was able to see him in the hospital. He got the worst of the physical injuries, but I can't even forget it, you know? I just... Thinking about it right now. It was... I cried. Cried then looking at him. I lost two of my limbs, but it affected both of us. This has changed us as people, but because we've stayed close, it has made a positive thing out of it. He watched me as, you know, I got out of the hospital to this depression. He was a witness to all of that. The care that Noah shows to us as a team, he gets that directly from the lessons he learned from Jerry. It's definitely a good experience to hear those stories. I couldn't ask for a better cadre. This next Circus, there may be a part of it that you're not gonna be next to each other, you know, giving each other, you know, the words of encouragement. You have to always keep in mind that you are still connected as one team. Thank you for taking time out to come here and be with us. - Yeah. - The pleasure's all mine. My very first platoon was with Sonny. He's just one of those guys that you can count on for any job we can ask a SEAL to go do. I know Sonny would move heaven and Earth to take care of me. I'd do the same for him. We were talking earlier, and he was mentioning to me how he felt you guys were really pushing yourself to the extremes to impress him, and he wanted to tell you guys to throttle back because you didn't need to prove anything else. - Yeah. - But then I reminded him about when we were young guys going through workups. We didn't do it just because we thought it was cool. The things we did were to impress our teammates. Sonny... he really put it into perspective. Not only are we here to challenge ourselves, but we're here to impress our team members, and I'm not giving up because I don't want to let Goldie and Mario down. You guys have gotten to know me. I get emotional when I talk about things I care about. Sonny's seen me do it. It's just the way I'm hardwired, but the thing that's neat about greatness is greatness, while it usually displays itself on a platform in a stadium, is born and nurtured in tough places. You know, it acts in the eyes and in the hands and in the body and the legs, but it lives in the soul. And greatness has nothing to do about winning or losing. Rorke has been amazing. I mean, he's been everything from motivating to inspiring, and most importantly, he's been honest. He's showed us things that we'll carry for the rest of our lives. We'll see you tomorrow, and we'll go get it done. This is a man who has carried us this far in this competition, and I know personally that for the rest of my life he will definitely have an impact on everything that I do. - Hooyah. - Hooyah. Obviously, I'm going to Circus. Tony ain't going. Goldie ain't going. Haze might be going. But I'm thinking Mario. Who would you guess is going from Noah? - I think David's going. - I'm thinking David. If David's going in, he's lacking confidence. Good. I'm gonna get in his head. - This is a competition. - Yeah. How much do you want it? Overall, when it comes down to it, Team Noah is on the mark to take one of them out and split that three up. I'm gonna give it hell. That's all we want, baby. We're gonna burn them down. Interested to see what happens today. Circus sentencing, huh? One. Two. Three. - Is that what you're planning? - Wow. - That's what you think, huh? - That's your prediction? That's my prediction. I actually think the same thing. I want to see David jump farther than the lumberjack. Oh! - Whoa! - Whoa! My goodness! What? You loosened up the anchors on that cargo net. I know. You better be careful when you guys go down it. Someone's gonna fall to their death on that thing. I'm thinking about this Circus, and that's what freaks me out. Everyone, deep down, is a little scared of what they're gonna have to do. At least I know for sure I'm going. You know for sure you're going? Nope. Do you want to go? That's a no. Whatever we do, we need to make sure that all three of you are in the finale. Kind of want to get y'all's opinion on who goes to the Circus, 'cause we got two people to choose from straight up. Well, in all honesty, I feel like I was hit by a truck yesterday. - Yeah. - And I'm doing everything in my power to recover, but I have some concerns. Mm-hmm. And it's not where I want to be. Give me a sec. I've been having trouble with my hamstring, and the sprinting all out really kills it. Admitting your weaknesses is hard for anyone to do. It's very humbling. My only concern is, is I don't want a free ride to the finale. There is no free ride. Y'all have dominated because you all have pushed yourself so hard. So, it makes sense that there is some breakdown. I want to finish three-strong. I mean, we all do. It sucks. I'd much rather just go run it myself. Let's go. ♪ For the first time, we have decided to tip our caps to let you wonder what may be in store for you tomorrow. A rather demonic structure in the background. A lot of stress and a lot of strategy on the shoulder of the cadre. Rorke, Noah, the competitors you decide not to choose will be in the finals. Nick, you have one competitor left in Jim. You have been chosen to face the Circus. Should you fail, not only is your journey on "American Grit" over, but Nick, so is your team's. John, I've survived the Circus twice, and one of those tickets to the finals is mine. Bold words. Rorke, Goldie the Circus slayer is immune. You have two very tough competitors to choose from. The person you don't select will be in the finals. Who are you sending to the Circus? I'm telling you, Haze, I know, is rip-roaring ready to go, but tonight I'm gonna go with my man, Mario. Mario, you've been chosen to face the Circus, which leads me to Noah. Who are you sending to the Circus? I want the team to go in three-strong, and in order to do that, I feel like one of them might need just one more extra day of rest. So, I'm sending to the Circus David. Me, Jim, and Mario, I think it's gonna be a very tough competition. We're all strong-willed. We all have some power and a little bit of speed. It would be a fight, tooth and nails. Jim, David, Mario, you've been chosen to face the Circus. Two of you will survive and remain in the running for a chance to win $250,000. One of the three chosen tonight will ring out and go home. And to come this far, that is a tough pill to swallow. Tomorrow will, indeed, be one of our most challenging Circuses to date. I will see you bright and early tomorrow. Let's go, Mario. I love you. Don't hurt yourself. With what we saw tonight at Circus, you have the biggest advantage. Are you just so excited? I don't know what it's gonna be, but it looks like it's gonna be climbing. Just think how it's gonna be tomorrow when Mario takes down an Olympic gold medalist. Mario takes down a man who helped take down the Boston Bomber. Ooh. I got goose bumps. I got goose bumps. Mario, the Olympic slayer. I'm loving it. How you feeling, bro? You know, obviously there's nerves, - but we're gonna be there. - Mm-hmm. I don't expect not to feel any kind of nerves, you know? As a preacher, I'm able to tap into some spiritual things that kind of help center me. They help me focus on what it is that I'm sent here to do. And I'm not gonna underestimate either of 'em. Yeah. You shouldn't. Yeah. I'm gonna go into it, put the burners on, and let it rip. You got no problem, man. I ain't worried at all. Make 'em both go home. ♪ Welcome to your last individual Circus. I say that because, as you know, in the final Circus you'll be competing as teams and running a much more grueling obstacle course, and the $250,000 prize will be given to every surviving competitor on the team that wins this very competition. Two of you will survive the Circus and make it to the finals. One of you will give up, ring out, and go home. Allow me to explain this rather intimidating structure you've had the evening to think about. It isAmerican Grit'sversion of a treadmill. It is an endless ladder suspended two stories in the air. When your test begins, you will climb down, under, up, and over your ladder. When you make it to the top of your ladder, you will see a button, and you must hit it to signify you've completed one rotation. Once you hit that button, you must wait for all the competitors to hit their buttons before you start the next revolution. You have a minute to complete a single rotation. Does this make sense? - Yes. - Yes. Now let's talk about the advantages of moving swiftly through the obstacle portion. Competitor to arrive third, they get no advantage. They start climbing immediately. After one rotation, competitor to arrive second begins the fray. After another rotation, the competitor to arrive first joins the test, and then you climb and we watch to see who will ring out. Yep. All we ask is all you got. Make your way to the starting line. - Mario! - Mario, You got this! Come on, David. - Still in it. - It's all gonna come down to his mental toughness. Jim has to suck it up on this. Like in the military, you make a mental mistake on the battlefield, it costs you your life or your teammate's life. We love you. I like the match-ups for Mario. Good luck, Jim. And that's the best I can do is try and pair my athlete against the skill set of the other athletes which I felt that we'd face. It's wet out there, so watch your footing. - Good luck, David. - We love you, Mario. I'm probably as excited to see this thing down here as any in a while. This is gonna be good. It's gonna be a tough Circus. David is an Olympic athlete, but he's going up against Mario, who is just tough as nails. And Jim is wanting to win this for his team. He's the only one left. A strong field and a brutal test. This is the last time you will run this course before it's altered for the final Circus. Competitors at the ready. Three. Two. One. Go! - Go, David. - Go, Mario! It's David's first time up there. Let's see how he's gonna do against Circus veterans Jim and Mario. - Good job, David. Good job. - You go! Use your legs. Come on, David. Way to go, Jim. Way to go, Jim. Mario, you're in the lead. Mario, get it! - Yeah, Mario! Let's go! - Let's go, Jim. Here we go. Go, Jim. - Look ahead. - Keep that lead, Mario! Advantages are crucial here. Mario up and over first. Good job, Mario. David in second place. Will he be able to catch up with Mario? Jim giving it everything he's got. - Here we go, David. - Let's go, Jim. - Good job, Mario. - Good job, Jim. Nice. Nice, Jim. Catch him. Catch him. Jim gaining on David. How can they keep this pace up? David pulls away. Come on. Come on, David. Come on, David. Come on, David. Come on, Jim. Killing it, guys. You're killing it. We looking for you, Mario. Get up that ladder. You got it. Mario up the Giant's Ladder. - I'll see you down there, Mario. - Nice, nice. You're good, baby. You're good. Nice and smooth, baby. Nice and smooth. Mario on the wet beam. Good job, Mario. Mario across the wet beam and onto the Burma bridge. Come on, Jim. Still in there, Jim. Jim might be the oldest competitor out there, but he's keeping up with an Olympic gold medalist, David. - You got this! - Mario! Mario! - David across the beam. - Yeah! Yeah, Jim! Look at Jim vying for that second place finish. - Go get them, Jim! - You got to catch them, Jim. Mario! Mario! Mario! Mario cruising to a big advantage in the endurance test, but who will get the last advantage? David or Jim? David through the Burma bridge, but Jim right on his heels. Mario at the cargo net on the way down. Good job, Mario. Here we go, David! It is official. You get some extra study time, Mario. You're the first to arrive on the platform. Good job, David. Come on. - Good job, David. - All right. Here we go, David. - David up in the net. - There you go, David. How far behind is Jim? - Here is Jim. - Get him, Jim! We got ourselves a finish. We got ourselves a finish. Everything on the line for Team Reaper. Down the stretch they come. Here we go. Oh, my God! We got ourselves a finish. - Get him, Jim! - Down the stretch they come. Here we go. Everything on the line for Team Reaper. An advantage on the line. Who is gonna hit first? - Good work, Jim! - Oh, my God! - Get over here, Jim! Let's go! - Two feet on the platform. Let's do it, baby! Yes! It's Jim. He gets an advantage. - That's what I'm talking about. - It's all right, David. - It's all right. - You're good. That's that net. It'll grab you. Let's get David up on the platform and the test will start immediately. Let's go. That's the grit, baby. That's the grit. Mario, you get two rotations. Jim, you get one. Let's start climbing those ladders. David, this is it right here. He's making you nervous, isn't he? - They always do. - Mm-hmm. Your hair looks terrible. - It's pretty bad. - It's terrible. - At least I have a hairline. - Worst I've ever seen it. It's the worst I've ever seen it. Wow. You got this, Mario. This is made for you. David, begin. - You got it, buddy. - You have one minute to complete your rotation and push your button. - Get a feel for it, David. - There you go, David! Nice. Steady. David, that's good. Go, Green. Good job, David. Good job. There you go. You're doing good. Going to the top to sit down. You got it. Keep this thing going, Jim. Don't forget to hit your button. Button hit. Okay, Jim, start. - Go, go, go. - There we go, Jim! Jim, you're not alone. You got people cheering for you, too, baby. Jim, you look strong. You're doing good. Down and back up. We're gonna do it over and over again. This rain is only making the challenge harder. Those rungs have got to be slippery. - Be steady, David. - Good hands and feet. Good hands and feet. Mario, you'll start on the next revolution. Don't forget to hit your button. 25 seconds left. Just sit down, David. - 20. - Wait for it. - Good job, David. - Good job, you guys! Remember: the rotation isn't finished until you press the button. It would behoove you to hit the button before zero. Why is he not pushing it right away? I don't want to rush him. If he needs the rest, - I'll let him have it. - Mm-hmm. The endurance is very well split between your physical capacity for work and your ability to focus. Knowing when to push the button. Your rotation is not complete until you hit your button. Five, four, three... All right. The button's on you, David. - The clock's reset again. - Here we go. Here we go, Mario. A little bit of clock strategy by David. I like it. Just like before, David. Smooth. Yeah, smooth. - Good focus. - Good job, Mario. - You're right on pace, David. - Good job. Holy crap. - Oh, be careful, David. - Come on. Be deliberate in there. Wouldn't want to slip and ruin this thing. Good job, Mario. All right. Wait for it, David. Keep the same pace. Same pace. David, push the button, man. Let's go. Let's get this thing going. Don't listen to him. He's pissing me off right now. I'm telling him to cut it out. - Seven, six... - He's getting my head. Five, four, three. Clock is reset. You gentlemen now know the pace. Be prepared for a lot of these. Good job, David. Good job. Got a good wife at home, Jim. Think about it. Oh, we're gonna be here a while, man. 40 seconds! Hit the button. Let's go. Come on. Want to race? Let's race. - Let's go. - I'll stand here all day. Cadre's already getting tired over here, David. We're wearing them out. - Yep. - Nick's complaining. Six, five. All or nothing. It's a jungle gym, Mario. Can't let Boston down today, Jim. This is easier than being in the Olympics. Careful footing. It's wet and slippery up there. You made it through nine weeks. It'd be great to get to that final round. - Get focused. - If I had a slingshot, I'd start hitting red buttons. The Navy SEAL's getting tired of standing in the rain. Six, five, four, three, two. Clock is reset. Mario, get them hands warm. If your hands get cold, think about how holding $250,000 will warm them up. - Press the button. - Does the sniper lack patience? - Four, three, two... - Don't miss it. Clock reset. - Every grip has to count, Jim. - Good job, Mario. Gentlemen, you've been around 42 times. Now it's getting fun. We just started. This isn't about how far you can go physically. This is about how far you can go mentally, Mario. Congratulations, gentlemen. 71 times. 71? I say we can make 100 at this pace. Be all grey and grizzled by the time they're done. I bet I'll have a grandbaby by the time they get done. I'm thinking we're gonna have another ambulance removal. Yeah, yeah. Gentlemen, you've been around 90 times. They have got to be freezing. Oh, David on top first. That's something new. Seems like David is warmed up. He's ready to pick up the pace. David switching up the strategy a little bit. Looks like Mario might be getting a little tired. This is the first time he was the last one up the ladder. Good job, Mario. You're holding strong. Be smart. Mario, you hit the button? Five, four, three... Did you hit it? I didn't see if you hit it. Two, one, zero. - Oh. - Wait, what? Looks like Mario might be getting a little tired. This is the first time he was the last one up the ladder. Mario, you hit the button? Five, four, three... Did you hit it? I didn't see if you hit it. Two, one, zero. Oh! - Time is out. - Wait, what? Mario, you've made a very fatal mental mistake. You failed to hit your button. - No. - What? Your time has reached zero. You must ring out. - What? Are you serious? - Competitors, the challenge is over. - Yes! - Good job, Jim. Nice. David! - David. You got it. - No. - Good job, David. - What? Oh, my God. No. No! Hey, dude, you're a hell of a athlete. It happens, you know. You good, bro. He was probably my strongest athlete, and it's just tremendously disappointing to go out on the part of the game that was no effort needed to be exerted other than, "You've got to hit this button." I guarantee you the game has now changed significantly in the minds of the other competitors, because he was someone to be counted on to be there at the end. David, Jim, you have survived the Circus and have made it to the finals of this competition. Mario had nothing short of a tragic mental mistake. Your journey on American Gritis over. Now you must ring out. I love you, man. This was yours to win, man. You know it. - You make us proud, Mario. - We love you, Mario. Thank you for everything. It's part of the game, and I did not hit the button. It's my fault. I accept that. The past nine weeks is definitely something that... That I'll grow from. Congratulations to all of you left. You are finalists in this competition. You have earned a spot to compete for a $250,000 grand prize. And I told you, as the numbers dwindled, the competition itself would become more and more intense. This news may be tougher on some than others. You have 30 minutes to get back to base camp, gear up, and get ready for your next challenge. - All right. - Get your heads right. - Go, go, go! - Come on, Goldie. We got to hurry. What the hell is going on? - Hey. - All right, so, hey... So, Mario didn't make it, but now we only have half an hour and we have to get ready and go to start the finale. Let's do it, baby. Put your game shoes on. - We in the finale. - Whoo-hoo-hoo. Still a team of three here. I'm so beat right now, I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do out there, but I'm gonna give it my best shot. Hands, muscles a little sore, a little cramped up, but it's fine, you know? I got to do what I got to do. We got to take it home for Mario. Hey. Let's go. Evolution time. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready. You got your hat? ♪ ♪ One challenge to go before for the final Circus, and the challenge today is facing your fears, because the one thing standing between you and that Circus platform is this 125-foot-high waterfall. This is a simple test of speed. You will cross the waterfall hand-over-hand, suspended from a cable above. The challenge may sound simple. When you're up there on that line, you certainly will have to face your fears. You will each cross individually. Team Rorke and Team Noah, the average time of all your team members will be what counts. Tony, Jim, you are teams of one, so your individual times will be what counts for your teams. The team that is most efficient today will be rewarded as such and will earn an important advantage in the final Circus. You will need every single advantage you can get. Team Rorke is up first. Haze making her way to the starting point. I miss Cam. He helped escape the stresses that go into Evolution and the Circus. He made me smile. Let's go, Haze! Three, two, one. Go! And away she goes. Come on, Haze. Keep coming, Haze! ♪ Every second counts. Come on! Come on! Seeing Haze up on this traverse is really making me think of this journey with her the whole time. She's about halfway across. It just seems like she's where she should be. It's starting to wear on her a bit. Come on, Haze! Come on, Haze! - What's happening? - Keep digging, girl! Keep digging! With a Marine as a father, that discipline and that focus and desire to win... I saw her being here at the end. She's giving it all she's got. She's stuck. Come on. Come on, Haze! She's going barehanded now. Come on, Haze! It's tremendously satisfying to know she's gonna compete right to the bitter end. Good job, Haze! - Keep coming! - Come on! Five feet from the finish. Come on! It's right there! And... - Home free. - Phenomenal. Phenomenal. Holy. That was hard. Trying to pull myself and I'm not going anywhere, So, I, you know, gloves had to go, and as soon as I felt the rope against skin I knew I had a better grip. Good job, girl. You couldn't have done it any faster. It absolutely took every ounce. Like, John Cena wants all that we got. I'm pretty sure I gave him all that I have just now. And now Goldie is getting into position. We'll average her time with Haze's 4:04 to get Team Rorke's official results. You got this! Three, two, one. Go. - Here she comes. - Let's go! Great start, Goldie. Come on. Good job, Goldie. Hand over hand. Inch by inch. Inch by inch. I think this experience is gonna be life-changing for Goldie, and it's been the same for me having her on my team. She's halfway. Now is when it gets tough. Come on, Goldie! She's had the physical challenge: multiple Circus rounds to go up against tough competitors. Keep fighting, Goldie! Keep fighting! She's got something inside her that just drives her to stay in the fight, and that's what we look for in SEALs. We look for somebody that's never gonna give up. That's who Goldie is. - Couple more pulls! - Couple more pulls! A couple more pulls! Just a few more! Come on, Goldie! Another big pull. Hit that yellow. - Yes! Yay! - Good job! Good job, Goldie! I've never had an advantage in the Circus. I've always been the last one on the platform. To go into the final... The moneymaker, the most important one... With an advantage, we need it. We need it right now. - Ladies. - Yeah? What was most challenging about this? For me, it was the second half. It felt like I was climbing uphill. You were. Your team average: 4:22. - Nice. - Congratulations. And now it's up to Tony to beat that time and earn an advantage in the Circus. Here we go, Tony! Three, two, one. Go! And Tony is away. - Come on. - Come on. Come on. Come on. ♪ Cruising through the first half. You know what this is like. He's about to probably hit a wall at 30 yards from the finish. Hand over hand. Hand over hand. Hand over hand. He's got the grit to go all the way through at this pace, which is breakneck. Keep going, Tony! Come on, Tony! - Come on, Tony! - Come on, Tony! Let's go! He's cruising right now. - Almost there. Let's go. - Come on, Tony! Make it hurt. Make it hurt. Grab the yellow! - Amazing time indeed. - Wow. 1:08. This is a power event. A power event. It's been a tough stack of loses. I lose Mario in a very, very brutal Circus, and then now I lose an advantage that I'm sure is gonna pay big dividends, and, look, my two girls can use it. You did it. You did it. You did it. Let's hope you got that time. Let's hope you set that bar. Team Tee needs a big win. Hopefully, none of them beat it, I get my advantage into the Circus, to the final Circus, and Team Tee, we're going up one. Mark will kick things off for Team Noah. Once again, it will be the average time of the whole team that counts. Whoo. 1:08 is the time to beat. In three, two, one. Go! And it's the big man, Mark, off to the races. Here we go, Mark. He is ripping through the course so far. Come on, Mark. You got it. Seeing Mark up there on that zip line, I feel confident that I made the best decision to fight to get him on our team. Halfway there. Come on, Mark! Mark is a huge part of why our team has been so successful. I mean, whatever it is, Mark answers the call. He is just a tough SOB that will push himself to the furthest limits. Starting to wear on him a bit. - Good job, man. Just keep going. - 15 yards from the finish. Pull, Mark! Come on! Yes. Yes. Yes. Ten yards. Five yards. Yes, Mark. That's what I'm talking about. And he is across. - Ah! - 55 seconds. Mark with the fastest time so far. Let's see if Clare can match that pace. - Come on, Clare! - Here she goes. In three, two, one. Go! Come on, Clare. Go, go, go. Little bit of a rough start. Keep going. Keep pulling. Come on, Clare. Come on. - Man, she is trucking. - Come on. Keep going. Clare is huge part of why our team has been so successful. Nothing's going to stop her. You know, no matter how difficult the challenge, she's going to push herself to that limit and go a little bit more. Home stretch! Push it. You got it. - Just like that. - You got it. She is cruising. 20 yards from the finish. - Keep going. Keep going. - Good job, Clare. Good job. Power through. Come on, Clare. - Ten yards. - You got it. Keep pulling, Clare. You got it. The final stretch. - Come on. Come on. - All the way. Touch it. - And she is... across! - Touch it. Touch it. - Oh! - Good job, Clare. Man. She had a great time through the whole stretch. Now it's up to David to maintain that pace and bring their team's average in under Team Tee's 1:08. The average time of all team members will be what counts. He looks like he's set. In three, two, one. Go! - Come on, David. - Here we go, David! ♪ - Look over there. - Come on, David. - Come on. - Come on. Come on. - Come on, David! Pull! - Good job! Keep pulling.

Pull. - 20 yards from the finish. - Come on. Yeah. - Come on, David. - Keep going. - Come on. Come on. - Keep pulling. - Come on, go! Go! - Pull! - Those big arms. He's using everything he's got. - You got it. - Five yards, and he's across. All three of you were fast. Did you expect any less? No. I'd have said "Cut the line." Right out there in the middle, "Let her go! Let her go!" As a team, you moved quite fast. Your team average as a whole: one minute. A very fast run as a team. It's gonna be very tough to beat. Thank you. Being on the SWAT team for 16 years, yeah, I've done some traverse lines before. On a good day, this would be my event. I don't think anyone here could touch me. But I was at the Circus. My arms and my legs are both bruised and hurt but I'm gonna give it everything I have left. It all comes down to Jim. The time to beat is one minute, set by Team Noah. Let's go, Jim! In three, two, one. Go! And Jim's away. He can't make any mistakes here. It all comes down to Jim. The time to beat is one minute, set by Team Noah. Let's go, Jim! In three, two, one. Go!

That was a good job. Good job, man. Good job. - How was it? - Was it fast or what? I think you were fast, dude. I think you were fast. You know, I didn't even have time to think about it. - Nice. - I was just going hand-over-hand as fast as I could... that's all. Glad you did it. - That was good, man. - That's a beautiful view. I didn't even notice there was a waterfall underneath me. Fantastic performance by everyone today. Not only did you show that you were all fearless, but at stake was a crucial advantage in that final Circus. Now it's time for the results. It has come down to Team Noah and Team Nick. Team Noah, your average time: one minute. Team Nick: Your time is... 1:04. - Yes! - Ugh! Damn. - Whoo! - Team Noah has, yet again, won the challenge and will gain a crucial advantage in the final Circus. Everything leading up to this moment has been training. It has gotten us ready for where we are right now, because this next Circus, somebody, or a team of people, are each leaving with $250,000. Tomorrow, we will see who has the grit to win this competition. Tomorrow, you will face your toughest challenge here onAmerican Grit: a bigger, badder, transformed Circus. Jim was so close. He lost it by just a few seconds. He's just gonna have to dig really, really deep and find something in him to win it. Bring your A-game. You will absolutely need it. ♪ How you feeling, brother? The money keeps popping up in my head. Like, "$250,000. That's a lot of money," you know what I'm saying? - I got to earn it. - Yep. We're two teams of one. Keep pushing till they tell me to stop. I'm sure there is a breaking point. I don't know where it is, but I'm sure it's there somewhere. Oh, it's there. It hurts. Team Rorke hasn't won a single challenge, and that was the one that counts. Team Rorke has come so far to go home empty-handed. You don't become a Navy SEAL by taking the easy route. And we've taken the hard, hard route... - The hard, hard route. - This whole way, and we have maintained. I feel like we're a major threat. Women have strength that no man can imagine. I feel like we are the best-prepared going into this final. When we're in this Circus today together, I'm doing this for you. I'm not gonna fall. I'm not gonna give up. And I'm doing that for you, and I'm gonna do that for Rorke. This will be Clare's first run at the Circus. The unknown factor is, how far can Haze go? - Right. - Give me a hug. And we know how far Tony's endurance lasts. I kind of know where their tap-out point is. - Mm-hmm. - I've been having issues with my hamstrings. Everybody has gotten a tweak here or there, and I'll give it my all, 'cause that's just who I am. Just got to go out there and do what we've been doing. Lay it all out on the line. Just give it everything we got, and we should go in this three-strong and come out three-strong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. ♪ - Hey. - John Cena! - Hey. - You mind if I sit? - Yeah. Sit down. - Hello. I'm so proud of all of you. You got to understand it's been my job to push you. It's been my job to sometimes put you in a place where you are uncomfortable. It's been a wonderful ride, but along the ride, you just... You develop a little bit of a thick skin, and what this has been about is making you better, stronger human beings, and y'all were...

Hi, my love. Daddy! Oh, my gosh. My dad, Alan. To have my mom and dad here, I know that they're proud of me, and I'm gonna fight every step of the way with my team to pull through on the other side. - I made you a book thing. - Oh, yeah? Oh! - Isn't that amazing? - It's amazing. I can't wait to see it. It's our first baby, and I'm so excited. I mean, my family's what drives me. I've been pushing myself.

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I'm challenging myself... Pushing myself through these Evolutions. - Is that your bed? - Yeah, that's my bed. You want to sit down? I'm doing this for my family to make a better life for us. Having them here, that's just gonna make it all that much better to come away with the win. Let me see you do it. This the one... I said I'm gonna put one of these in my house. - I would do that. - I'm doing it for Tee, myself, my family, my daughters, and I want to win bad so everyone knows, like, even a team of one can make it all happen. If you don't make it or you get beat out by your other competitors, then, you know, you get sent home.

"Do this for Anthony," my son. "Do this for Christina," my daughter. I want them to be proud of you. I want them to say, "That's my dad." I want my wife to say, "That's my Jim." That's what keeps me going. ♪ Welcome to the final Circus ofAmerican Grit. You are our finalists. You've all earned your spot to be here. It'll be my honor to watch you all compete today on this field. For a little added incentive, we've brought back your former team members to cheer you on. We've brought back your families to cheer you up. And the cadre has specially requested some very important individuals that represent the United States of America be here to cheer you on as well. You all know what's at stake today. The surviving finalists of the team that wins this competition will each win the $250,000 grand prize. Should you ring out during the final Circus, your journey is over, and the endurance will continue, and that bell will keep ringing over and over until there's only one team standing. Well, with the stakes that high at an event this big, we decided to make some changes. We made changes to the Circus itself. It is more challenging. Obstacles you have never seen before. We also made changes on how the Circus itself is run. Today, all seven of you will run the course at the same time. All of you will be running it twice. After the first run, there will be a 15 minute endurance test, and after the second run, we will keep going until we have a winner. After each run, the first full teams to reach the platform will each win an advantage. The last team to arrive on this platform receives no advantage. Their test begins immediately. One minute later, the third place team will join the fray. Two minutes later, the second place team jumps in. Three minutes later, the team that was quickest joins the test. - Understood? - Yep. The test is called Hold Your Own. You will go to your designated station and you will see a rope there. You will set yourself up on your post, and the first time around, you will hold the top knot for 15 minutes. Then you will run the Circus again. After that, you'll climb back up on your post and you'll hang on to the lower knot. And we will wait while you hold. And we will wait until there is a winner. Yesterday, Team Noah won the final Evolution, and they receive a one minute head start in the Circus. Makes sense? All righty. One thing left to find out: what team today will prove that it has American grit? Let's suit up and get to the starting line. You got this! Let's go! As I look at the course today, this is gonna be savage. I mean, we are gonna have some genuine suffering. But if anybody can do it, Haze and Goldie can. That's what we look for in the SEALs. We look for somebody that's never gonna give up. We just think we can beat anybody that we go head-to-head with, and because we believe that, we pretty much can. Let's go, Tony! Tony was a professional football player. So, you don't come into a game like this just wanting to take the slow road. You want to prove yourself, and he's gonna show his American grit. Yeah! Come on, David! I wanted to go into the final Circus with as many people as possible. We are the largest team. We have three-strong. If my team can stick it out together all the way to the end, each wins $250,000. - Whoo, Jim! - Yeah, Jim! Jim was really worried about not representing me in the finale. I told him, you know, free himself of that. Don't worry about it. It's not about me. It's about him. He has to put forth everything he has and hopefully knock it out the park. The time for talk is over. Each of you have persevered to get here. Now you have one last chance to make yourself and your cadre proud. Remember: all we ask is all you got. It's time to find out what team truly has American grit. Team Noah has earned a one-minute head start. Team Noah at the ready. Three, two, one. All right, here we go. Competitors at the ready. Team Noah has a one-minute head start. Three, two, one. All right, here we go. - Nice, good steps, guys. - Come on, Clare! Team Noah's advantage is done. All other competitors at the ready. Three, two, one. Let's go. Let's go. Get up that wall, Tony. Let's go. Come on, guys. Team Noah up and over the cargo net. Let's see if the other teams can catch up. - Tony! - Come on, Jim. Let's get this party started. - Yeah, Jim! - You got this, Tony. You got this. Team Tee is now in second place, followed closely by Team Nick. Clare's having a hard time. She's hurting. Team Rorke is finally up and over, but in last place. All teams trying to catch the head start of Team Noah, who has reached the Giant's Ladder. There's new obstacles up there. David, no stranger to hurdles, handles them with ease. Mark choosing a very unique method over the hurdles. Good job, guys. Clare! Here we go. Nice. Nice. Let's go, baby. Let's go. Team Rorke is struggling with the hurdles, but Team Noah still has to crawl through the barbed wire mud pit. Make your money right here. Make your money! Tony making his way across. Jim should be not far behind. Come on, Jim. Team Noah approaching the final descent. Mark doing his human cannonball. - Let's go, Tony. - Good job, guys. All right, Green. Team Noah has arrived on the platform first and has received a three-minute advantage. Good work. Here is Touchdown Tony. Let's go! Let's go! Team Tee has reached the platform second. You will have a two-minute advantage. Should be seeing Jim any minute now. Let's go, Jim. Team Nick has arrived. You get yourself a one-minute advantage. And here we are. Haze and Goldie arrive as a pair. Good job, girls. Good job. Girls of the grit! Girls of the grit! Team Rorke has arrived. Man your posts. We'll start the endurance test immediately. This is where we live, Blue. Haze and Goldie alone, grab the highest knot, lean back, hold on. And hold. Girls, get that good position. Goldie, get in your spot. Jim, in under a minute, you'll begin. You girls just hold. Just hold. Less than 30 seconds. Jim, you have less than ten seconds. Get ready, Jim. Three, two, one. Hold. Lock in, Jim. Find your spot, Jim. Tony, less than one minute. We've been here before, Jim. Three, two, one. Hold. Easy there. Team Noah, you have less than one minute. Everybody's in it soon, girls. Stay right there. Yep. Keep it up, Jim. It's just you, Jim. Team Noah. Three, two, one. Hold. There's a reason why you guys are here. You're all winners. This test will last for 15 minutes, and then we will run the Circus again. Great job by everybody. Hold on there tight. Nothing to it, Blue. Nothing to it. One minute left. Let's go, girls. Stay in there. You're not allowed to stop, Jim. You tell your body what to do. Make it burn, David. You got to want it. - Come on, Goldie. - Under ten seconds. Three, two, one. Yeah! Let's make our way to the starting line. For the final run through the Circus, no team will have a head start, but at stake is the same advantage for the one, two, and three-minute rest. Tony, you got this, baby. Haze, Goldie, save those arms. Get up there with legs. - Stand at the starting line. - Hey, Jim. Next time, breathe. Breathe. Green, y'all got to run this one. There you go. Finalists at the ready. Three, two, one. Go, Tony! Let's go! Let's go, baby! Let's go! Anybody's ball game. Anybody's ball game. Come on! Mark, up and over. There you go! There you go! David, up and over. - Come on, Clare. - Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony, up and over. - Jim right behind him. - There you go. You're doing great, Goldie. You're doing great. - Use those legs. - Haze, up and over. Clare, up and over. Keep pushing, Goldie! Mark and David are first to the Giant's Ladder, but their teammate Clare is far behind. She might be struggling with that hamstring. Keep in mind: they have to hit as a team to count for the advantage. Mark is waiting for Clare. Tony passes him. Let's go, Tony. Come on, Clare. All right, Clare. Pick it up. Go. Go. All advantage is crucial here, and it's Touchdown Tony first to cross the beam. Let's go, Tony! David right behind. Jim up and over, but Clare is still trailing behind. And now Jim passes Mark and Clare. Team Rorke has finally started the Giant's Ladder. Tony firmly in the lead. Jim vying for that second-place finish, but right on his tail, Mark and Clare. Tony better hurry. He has an Olympic gold medal winning sprinter on his tail. Mark overtakes Jim at the Burma bridge. Exhaustion might be taking its toll. No one has ever run the Circus twice in a row. Team Rorke still gambling on pace. And here is Tony knowing how crucial that advantage is. Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! You'll receive a three-minute advantage. Here is David rounding the bend, Mark right behind him. Good job. Go! But Clare still has to beat Jim to the platform for the Green Team to get that two-minute advantage. Hey, Jim, you got to pick it up! Here comes Jim and Clare neck and neck. We're gonna have ourselves a finish. Go! Come on, Jim. Everybody tumbling down. They must finish as a team. Come on. Come on. Come on. We got a pile of bodies! Go! Come on, Jim! Everybody tumbling down, but they must finish as a team. We got a pile of bodies! Jim struggling from the position. I have one from Team Noah. All right, good job! Jim is here and defeats the remainder of Team Noah for second place. You'll have a two-minute advantage. - Nice! - Hell of a finish, guys. Team Noah, you get yourself a one-minute advantage. - You know the drill. - There's Goldie. Right behind her, Haze. Great job. All legs. To your post. Come on, girls. You can do it. Ladies, mount up and hold on. Haze, Goldie. This time, you're gonna be using the lower knot, so it's gonna be much more difficult. - The clock has started. - All day, Blue. This is where we live. This is where we live. Team Noah, in under a minute, you will join the fray. You girls go where you go. ♪ Five, four, three, two, one. Hang and hold. - Find your spot. - You're in. Jim, in under a minute, you'll begin. Put your mind where you need it. Five, four, three, two, one. Hold and hang. There you go, Jim. Tony, you got under a minute. Touch your hands, baby. Let them warm each other. You got this. You're good, Goldie. Find that spot. You'll be here all day, girls. It's just a rope, Jim. It's just a rope. Four, three, two, one. Hang and hold. Everybody's in. Now we're gonna wait. Come on, Haze! Let's go, Goldie. Let's go. Goldie, Haze, hang in there. ♪ All right, Haze. We got this. Good job there, Haze. Stay right in your game. Stay right in your game. Green Team, either black out or win. There's no other option. You got to want it. Hey, Jim. Thrust your pelvis. Take some weight off your pelvis, Jim. Jim, you're good. Find that zone and you stay there. $250,000 on the line. Do not drop. Stay in there, Haze. Stay in there. Stay in it. Make it burn, David. You got to want it. Come on, Haze. You got this, Haze. Hey, Jim. Look at me one second, Jim. Do not drop. Remember what's on the line here. All your work, all your pain. Stay in it, girls. Stay in it, girls. You got it, Haze. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got to want it! Hold it, David. Hold it! Stay in it. Stay in it. - Hold the rope! - Stay in it. Do not drop. ♪ Haze, you must ring out. It's all right, Haze. It's all right, girl. Rorke has been a teacher, a father, a friend, an incredible cadre. I did not win, but I am definitely walking away with a lifetime of memories. Let's go, Blue. You got one horse left. Team Rorke and Goldie, you can still win this thing, but you have to outlast everyone. All four teams still got a chance at the money. Who wants it more? You can hear the bell, but don't ring it. Goldie, hang in there, damn it! Hey, Jim! You are not letting go. People are hurting, Goldie. Trust me. They're hurting. Clare, hold it. I promise you, you got this. Try not to move, David. Try not to move. Don't drop that rope! Don't you drop that rope! They're going, Goldie. They're going. Goldie, do not drop! Do not drop! Come on, Clare. Find that spot. I know your bodies are burning, but do not let go! - Pain is an illusion. - Hold the rope! Hold the rope, David! Hold the rope! They're falling, Goldie. They're falling. Just zone out, Clare. - Aah! - Focus, David. Stay strong. ♪ David, you did awesome. Head high, David. You must ring out. I definitely gave it everything I possibly could give it. Head high, David. I'm gonna keep doing what I've been doing. I'm a minister, so I'll continue to preach God's message, and I will remember this forever. All four teams are still alive. You outlasted an Olympian. Can you outlast each other? You're almost there, baby. This tests your arms, back, your legs. Every part of your body is gonna be feeling this. This is where we separate success from failure. Clare, put yourself somewhere else. You can still do it, Goldie. You can still do it. Come on, Clare. Just hang on. Jim, you hold onto that rope! Hold onto that rope! I didn't win $250,000, but I faced a lot of fears that I never thought that I would. But ringing out sucks. Head up, Goldie. Seeing Haze and Goldie come just footsteps shy of taking this thing home was tough. I would not have thought I would get so connected to these four athletes and get so invested in the game that it meant as much as it's meant. That's actually a gift they've given to me. All right. You heard the bell. You do not want to ring that thing. Three teams still alive for the prize. Touchdown Tony representing Team Tee the Marine. This ain't it. You got this. Nick and the Rangers have Jim, the grizzled veteran cop. You have done way more than this, Jim. And Army Veteran Noah still has Clare and Mark hanging on. Mark, you got a baby that needs this. Hold it, Clare. Hold still. Every second counts. Aah! Hey, Jim! Suck it up! You found your zone, Green. Stay there. Aah! ♪ I came here for a challenge, and I gave it everything, but American Grit found my limit. This competition really affected me more than I thought it would. I don't really get attached to people, and it kind of forced me to invest my emotion. I hated seeing individuals go home. Kind of almost had me drop a few tears, but can't do that, so... We are down to three left. $250,000 on the line. If you're tired, that's a friggin' wake-up call. You're all holding your entire body weight. Who can last the longest? Big Mark, don't you drop that rope, you son of a bitch. This is it. This is it. Tony, don't you give up on me. You hang in there, young man. - Come on, Tony. - Come on. You need it. You hold the rope. Hold it. Don't give up. They're about to drop. You just got to hold on. Come on, Clare. Just hang on. Hold on! Hold on! Hold it, Mark. You got it. Come on! Hang in there! Hang in there! Stay focused. Stay focused. Hold it. - Hold on. - Hold it. They're dropping. Stay, Clare. Stay, Mark. Come on. - It is over. - Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! - Yeah! - Oh! Hey, man. - Yeah! - Yeah! Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony. Whoo! I can't use my arms. - Whoo! - I don't. Everybody who performed today showed true American grit. So, it is with great honor that I announce the winners of the very first competition ofAmerican Grit. Representing Team Noah, taking home a combined total of half a million dollars, Clare and Mark. Congratulations. Good job, man. Noah's an incredible inspiration, and for some reason, he saw something in each one of us and pieced us together to make a real solid team. - Mark, how do you feel? - I feel great. It was amazing to have this chance to compete with and against so many amazing people. Seriously. It was awesome. Leading my team onAmerican Grit has been great for me. I miss being in the military, and to have these four tough men and women that were here to be pushed and to be challenged, that makes me proud. They have wonAmerican Grit. ♪
