 -Previously... -This is Garbeau country, and I'm a Garbeau man. -[slurping] -[Krystal] It's been two weeks since Obie put you on security? And I haven't heard jack about Splashercize. You want me to wear your ring? Show me what you're worth. Where is my son, anyway? I'm sure Obie's holding him up. The amount of my money Cody has handed over to that idiot...

 Your money? [Obie] You wouldn't believe the trash I get. -[laughs] Hey! -Oh, stop. Krystal! Fuckless tit. What are you talking about? The margins on the FAM products are slim. What? But Obie pays Garbeau Foundation employees from the tapes and from the rallies and the books. Get the fuck out! [Ernie] Ernie Gomes is full-time FAM time. I just resigned from Rebel Rapids. I'm sorry I got you into this.

 I thought there was a way to win. There isn't. We got to get out. We got to get out of this. Stop it! You can't talk like that! [Krystal] This is Krystal Stubbs. You gave me your card at the FAM rally. I've got a story for your TV show. A big story. [Lars] Sometimes, they look terrible and they're worth a fortune. Sometimes they're shiny and worth nothing. Hmm. What's this one? Hmm. Two karats. Clear, but not flawless. Waste of my time. That diamond is an SI2. Hmm. You've already shown it to someone. Was it James? Across the street? [opera music playing] And how much did he offer? [scoffs] I'll give you... $6,000. I'll tell James you said hello. Hmm. Seven. He said he's never seen a diamond quite like it. It's got sparkle. And fire. Nine. James offered me ten. You give me $10,500 in cash right now, and the rock is yours. I'm keeping the ring. But you got to swap that diamond with something cheap. [chuckles] Flint glass. Hmm. Okay. You're giving me money? Investing it in the park's future. Splashercize. -[groans softly] -Imagine four billboards, one on each of the cloverleafs at I-95. I've been working on some designs. Did Janice kick you out? -These ones are actually good. -[Krystal] Yep. So you sell more park passes and I get more butts in the pool. Two-dollar butts. That means 4,000 people would have to take your classes before you even make your money back. Which is why you're gonna make me park manager. [scoffs] Yeah. A lady manager. My daddy would be -rolling over in his grave. -Hey. Who fixed the pump on the Robert E. Whee? No one else knows this park like I do, and no one else'll work for a shitty $375 a week. -$300. -Ernie made $350 and I've been here longer. You're the reason Ernie quit. That FAM scam. I... I feel like crap about that. And yet you're asking for his job. He won't mind. He knows I got a kid and a mortgage to pay. $350 a week. No higher. Fine. ♪ upbeat synth-pop music ♪ ♪♪ Hey, Cheryl.

I was thinking how more moms would come to Splashercize if we had a place they could leave their babies. -[Destinee fusses] -I've been thinking my ass looks fat in these shorts. So what? So, you know that room behind Gator Bites? You're turning it into a daycare. Did Ernie okay this? I okayed it. Okay. You can charge 50 cents an hour per kid and keep it. -Thanks, Krys. -Mm-hmm. But you can't charge for this one. Mama's got some bossing to do. [kisses] [Destinee coos] Snack shop, Amber? [Amber] Go for Amber. It's Krystal.

[heavy metal playing over stereo] ♪♪ [music stops] [Krystal] You see what I'm talking about with this scam? Ben Franklin wasn't a president. They make it confusing on purpose. So no one can get clear answers. They're counting on people being exhausted -and brainwashed. -Thanks. These are people who claim FAM made them millions, but-- [blows raspberry] -it's all lies. -Devil's advocate here. Isn't this how business works? Only a few people make it. My kid doesn't have a father because of FAM. He worked himself to death and never broke even. That's a sad story, but it's not news. The news is nothing but sad stories. Plus, this has got to be fraud or false advertising. People believe this bullshit. They quit their jobs. My neighbor, he quit his job. You don't need to go on TV to tell your neighbor the truth. I tried talking to him, he's just like Travis. He won't listen to anyone but Obie Garbeau II. Well, no audience is gonna care. They want serial killers or cannibalism. Is this Obie guy a cannibal? [inhales sharply] Maybe. [Destinee crying over monitor] One sec. Oh, Obie has his own private security force. Run by this mouth-breather named Roger Pendleton. And my upline, Cody Bonar... What's the matter, baby? Mommy being too loud? [Krystal talking softly] Obie gave him a gun. People have guns. It's more than just a gun. It's gold and engraved. [Destinee fusses] I think it might be satanic stuff. But he does whatever Obie asks; I mean, he sleeps with that stupid gun. -So you two are close. -We were. Anyway, I'm done with him. Worm. No judgment here. But we need evidence if this story's gonna sell. -[whimpers] -Hey. What's wrong? Let Mama see. I think she must be pushing another tooth. I used to use that trick on my daughter, too. -Yeah? How old is she now? -19. Bet that's worse than teething. [chuckles] If we're gonna do this, you need to stay close to this Bonar guy to know when he's gonna meet with Obie. [groans] It's our best chance.

There's no reason for an arrangement of chrysanthemums that size except to cover a podium. You're holding a rally, aren't you? [sniffs] With the Bridges Method, IBOs, they actually make money. So much money that many of them choose to retire to the Sunshine State. Now, if this growing Bridges population -wants to come together-- -That's a breach of the Garbeau-Bridges Neutrality Pact. As a member of Obie Garbeau II's security team, I've got to inform you that I'm going to inform him. -Security? Hmm. -Yeah. -The elite security team. -So... you're not your own boss anymore? -Drop the flowers. That's right. -I already did. Uh-huh, that's great. ♪ dramatic music ♪ Why do you have a gun?

No hay chiles enlatados, ni nopales, ni jícamas, -así que ¿cómo cocinamos? -[Ernie] Hey. Mr. Garbeau's tapes are five dollars apiece, okay? Make sure everyone buys one. Wait, what about your tapes? Those are priceless. That means they're free. Step right up. Get your tapes here, en español. No. No, you tell him, no RV camping.

Dream-masters. I'm calling it Dream-masters. -Yeah. -Mr. Garbeau, sir? [Klaus] I'll take those. Yeah. I'll call you back. What I... said the other night... it was wrong. Now I understand why Splashercize doesn't fit. If folks could change the Garbeau System all willy-nilly, it'd be a dang mess. [chuckles] [Cody] I keep saying to her, what does a family-oriented water park in Central Florida have to do with the Garbeau System, anyway? -He does say that. -Yeah. -[Krystal] A lot. -[Cody chuckles] I'm sorry, who are you again?

Intercept her for me and bring her up here. You know this is crazy, right? You said I should try to stay busy. [exhales] [Roger] He's serving 20 years for money laundering. The boy's been visiting twice weekly since his father was locked up. What Cody Bonar chooses to do in his free time is his business, not yours. Oh, it's my business when it threatens your business. Buck Bridges is the threat. Yes. And I have ideas about that. But the Bonar boy should not... Um... [sighs] Give us a minute, Hans, please. -[clock chiming] -Thank you. [door opens] [door closes] Spit it out. The court documents are sealed, but my man at the prison said the word among the inmates: baby Bonar went to the FBI with evidence against his own father. It's prison gossip. I think your use of the boy is reckless. I think that you're forgetting who is the mind and who is the hand. And I say, let's put Mr. Bonar to the test. [Mirta] There's a tape recorder built into the bottom here. When Cody's paged, just turn the tape recorder on. I'll be waiting outside your place. Wherever Cody goes, I'll be following with a camera. There's 90 minutes of tape. -Okay. Let me try. -Okay. -Here. Hold on. -Oh. Hello. -Hello. -Okay... How long till you get this story out? Well, a good story takes time. Well, the longer it takes, the more people Obie screws. Let's hope we get something good tonight. Oh. Do you have a bathroom I could change her in? Use my desk. Okay. Hey there...
