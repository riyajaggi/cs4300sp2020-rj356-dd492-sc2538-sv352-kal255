 Previously... [CODY] He was my workhorse. Well, keep the wife. [CODY] She can be very negative, sir. I want to talk about Travis's business in light of the tragedy. - Are those...? - What do you want, Cody? I'm from Sunshine Repo, and your husband, rest his soul... He has a few things that technically belong to the bank. Well, it looks like one of your mortgages is past due. Wait, what? "One of"? I need a raise, an advance, something.

 [STAN] Water-obics needs a new instructor. [BUZZ] My daughter Becca, she's prepping for Miss Teen Zuber. She's gonna need a proper coach. [KRYSTAL] I'm, like, one bad day from losing my house. That's called "surrendering your leverage." Is that what you called it when you were trading tiaras for tug jobs? Give her an upline bonus. Use the value of your business to show this widow her value. - Ta-da! - [KRYSTAL] Give me double, - and I'll grow it. - You'd recruit? [KRYSTAL] I'll have Ernie signed up in a week. Guys, my life is good. [SCREAMS]

 Hey, what's the, uh, fine for gator poaching? Really? Ten thou? [KNOCKING] [CECE PENISTON'S "FINALLY" PLAYING] [KRYSTAL] Shake those hips! Squeeze those buns! Shake those hips! Squeeze those buns!

No pain, no gain. Twist... twist... twist, and squeeze those buns. Squeeze... squeeze... - squeeze... - [OBIE] People... are terrified of no. N-O. Just two little letters, but hearing them... brings a man face-to-face with his soul. That's why Timmy is afraid to swing during the biggest at bat of his Little League life, and he cries in front of the girlie he's got a crush on. That's why Martin keeps his mouth shut at his J-O-B when Johnny Big Stuff takes credit for Martin's idea and walks off with the big promotion. [DISTANT CHATTER] It isn't the no that makes your life terrible. It's the fear. - Oh, shit. - [ERNIE] Oh, it's all right. It's all right. I got it. Oh. Oh, thanks, Ernie. - Oh, you're welcome. - Oh, it's wet. [ERNIE] Full of water now. Where you been, girl? Oh... enjoying hotel room service. Yeah. My FAM business is booming, and my floors were just begging to be redone. [LAUGHS] So... Have you thought about it anymore? - Starting your own business? - [MAN OVER SPEAKERS] Ernie. - Nacho tank two is... - I'm sorry, I got... - Yeah, I got this. - I got to go. Okay, thank you. All right, all right, coming. [OBIE] The fear. The fear that you'll run and hide in a corner when it comes time to prove what you're made of. The fear... that you're weak. Do you want to know what I say to the letters N-O? Ask Dave Dingle in Memphis, Tennessee. Go ask Dave. Dave Dingle told me, "No, you can't take my wife dancing in the Dominican," and I said, "Thank you, Dave." - Bonar? - Yes? Your dad won't see you. Disagree. He will see me this time. [POUNDS ON GLASS] [OBIE] Thank you, Dave Dingle. Ha! Ha-ha! Thank you, Dave Dingle! Thank you for giving me drive. Thank you, Dave Dingle, for volunteering yourself as my target. [OVER EARPHONES] I will destroy your no. I will crush your no into powder, and I will... [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] - Your no is music... - [MAN] Uh, keep walking, boy. [OBIE] ... to my ears, and Mrs. Dingle and I will dance the bachata to it. - [CRYING, SNIFFLING] - Come on! Let me feel it! Come on! Let me feel your yes! My favorite thing to hear is no. My favorite thing to hear is no, because that means I am close to a yes. [LATIN SONG PLAYING OVER EARPHONES] [CLICKS] [TAPE REWINDING] [OBIE] And I will sift it all over my yes-flavored dessert. Ha! - [BACHATA MUSIC PLAYING] - Your no is-is music to my ears, - [SNIFFLES] - and Mrs. Dingle and I will dance the bachata to it. ♪♪ - Come on! - [MOUTHING] Let me feel it! Let me feel your yes! Come on! Let me feel your yes! My favorite thing to hear is no. My favorite thing to hear is no, because that means I am close to a yes. [COFFEE POURING] Hi, Stan. I've been working on these - on my breaks. - Mm-hmm. Billboard ideas for Splashercize. Could really draw some crowds in off the interstate. "Wet Sweat." "Wave Goodbye to Your Fat." "Make a Splash in Your Bikini." No. No? You didn't even look at 'em. Hey, this helps you, too. We got, like, three people coming into class every day. Don't you want more? The point of paying you two dollars a head is that you do the advertising. If that's not enough, well, that's your problem. Well, I can't live in the stockroom forever. You're right, you can't. So you're not gonna help me out? You're just gonna let me starve? [CHUCKLES] Starve, huh? Don't think I haven't noticed all those hot dogs that have gone missing lately. What do you expect me to eat? Look, I am the only one that is helping you right now, okay? So don't point your finger at me. Point it at yourself. What the fuck does that mean? You shot those gators, right? You got caught. You had to go and pay that poaching fine. And if that means you're without a house, well, that's your fault. It was my house or jail! I couldn't go to jail. Here's the thing. You get yourself all worked up in a tizzy, and then you do something rash. You've got a temper. And you've got your head up your ass! Have a great night. Thank you! [DESTINEE CRYING OVER BABY MONITOR] Shit. [DESTINEE CRYING LOUDLY] [CRYING STOPS] Okay. [GASPS] Oh. - [FUSSING] - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

Could I trouble you for a restroom? Morning coffee just turns me into a hose. Oh, well, renovations on the house are in full swing, so... - water's shut off. - Can't wait to see it. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [HORN HONKS] - Do you mind? - Course. [BACHATA MUSIC PLAYING] No. We're throwing a rally. It'll be a real morale boost. I don't have time for rallies. - [MUSIC STOPS] - I don't have time for you not to have time, okay? I've got to get to the ballroom ASAP. There are curtains to hang, balloons to fill, streamers - to stream... - Our deal was that I do this and you pay me... that's it. And only until I get my house back. Our deal was that you were gonna stick to the deal. Have you locked down Ernie? Well, Krystal, you haven't even done the distro. What do you want? A handout? Okay, okay, here's a handout. Here's another. I don't have any more hands to put out. Looks like you might have to actually do some work. - Huh? - Ernie's in the process, okay? And what do you mean, I'm not doing the distro? What's all this, then? Well, Carol says that order right there has been just sitting there like that for weeks. Carol needs to mind her fucking business. Well, Carol is gonna be here any minute to check on you, so cool your beak on the freaks if you ever want to get paid again. Hmm? Well, why hasn't this Mimi lady been picking up her orders? [GROANS] Travis used to personally deliver that one, okay? Why? That's not the system. [SIGHS] Why would he personally deliver something, Cody? I'm already behind schedule. I've got choreography to learn. Ask Carol. Look what I got! Rally tickets. [KRYSTAL] Yeah. Sell them to your downline. [KIDS LAUGHING AND CHATTERING PLAYFULLY] [BELL RINGING IN DISTANCE] Ugh. Come on. Not the "boobs" kid again. Does the park seem... different recently? Well, the smell sure has improved, that's for sure. Yes, it has, but... that's not really what I'm getting at here. You know, I used to come out here as a boy. My father would walk his grounds, and everybody would wave at him. "Hello, Harry," they'd say. They were his friends. They were our neighbors. Now I look out from my office, and... I don't recognize the faces. I don't recognize the park. Well, you just got to get out here more. Yeah. Hey. Hola, Garcia. [BOTH SPEAK SPANISH] - Hey. Hola. - Hola. - [GIRL] Hi. - [SPEAKS SPANISH] Hello. [BELL RINGING IN DISTANCE] It's like you don't even see what's happening around you. And it's your job, to see. Y-You know, I'm-I'm...

Okay. [CHUCKLES] Okay, I-I get it. - I get it, I get it. - Yes. Good. [SIGHS] W... Well, you know, generally, uh... people don't wear shirts, so is this a bathing suit issue? I just need you to bring it... All right. Call it, um... Suburban Outreach. Huh? - Hmm? Here, take these... - Ah. Yeah. Half-off passes. Go to the malls, go to the zoo, and you give those to affluents, people that live in cul-de-sacs. Just... make it my father's park again. You got it, Stan. All right. Get that shit off. [CHEERING, LAUGHTER] Oh, honey, the Garbeau System can make any man feel like a stallion. Now, of course, I don't worry about my own stallion, because he's getting an all-you-can-eat hay buffet at home. Oh. Come on. Personal drop-offs? Late-night counseling sessions? Overnight seminars three towns over. Oh. These men... like to make you think they're working hard, but... Oh. Travis barely had energy for me and Destinee. [CHUCKLES] Why, of course. Of course, right. Travis was a good man, a loyal man. I'm sure there's no reason to worry about this Mimi Waldenstock. Oh. We're gonna hang out while Mama and Mimi have a nice chat. [CAROL CHUCKLES] [LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC] ♪♪ [EXHALES] My injection is not until next week. Oh. Mimi? Yeah. Oh. I... I've got your FAM orders. They're just taking up space in my yard. Oh, honey.

It's stenosis. [CHUCKLES WEAKLY] Oh, y... you are stunning, like Travis said. [CHUCKLES] I'll show you... where Travis always put the stuff. [CHUCKLES] How exactly did you know Travis? [LAUGHS] I taught him tenth grade history. Twice. [BOTH LAUGH] Oh, he was a real... charmer. [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS] Where's all your FAM stuff? It's out here. You can put it wherever you like. Huh. Why do you keep ordering this stuff just to dump it out here? Oh, no. [CHUCKLES] I'm just storing it. It's all Travis's. He bought it.

[KRYSTAL SCOFFS] It's worthless. Oh, it must have some value. Travis bought so much. Oh, honey, I... Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I don't need your pity right now. It's not pity. It's an apology. Every time he came around, there was some new story, some-some plan for the two of you. Uh, taking you to Bali, putting Destinee in private school. You don't vacation in Bali i-if it's not working, you know? Oh. Oh. They told him to buy this crap, just 'cause they said to. He wanted to believe so bad, he did whatever they told him to, no matter what. [AIR HISSES] No matter what. [BACHATA MUSIC PLAYING] ♪♪ Yes. Nice, Cody. Mm. [COUGHS] Can't breathe back here.

I sold 30 tickets to my downline today. Hey! That's great. - Yeah. Yeah. - Wow. But what I'd really love is to speak at the rally. What would you say? I would talk about how my upline has affected my life. Mr. Garbeau says... that's what every great speech is really about. [LAUGHS] Great. Great. Let's keep going.

So stop answering the phone. Aren't you tired of doing stories with a positive spin? I've been calling around. There's a rally in town tonight. - Not gonna happen. - Come on.

He was trying, but trying just meant he cried when he started drinking again. I showed him the pregnancy test, and I told him I wouldn't raise a child with a drunk. A week later, Travis came home with a FAM starter kit - and told me... - [GASPING] "I found it." [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHEERING] [KRYSTAL] FAM became everything to Travis... More than liquor, even... - Because FAM made him feel good. - [WOMAN] Aw. And for a while, that was great. But Travis chased that feeling into the swamp... and never came out. [SIGHS] Travis gave everything to FAM. His nights. Our money. His life. When Travis got eaten by that gator, I lost everything. You don't know how scared you are until you're looking at your baby and wondering where she's gonna sleep that night. [SNIFFLES] [CODY] Krystal! I looked at my life after Travis died. At bills, debts, loneliness. At the vultures. At my screaming baby and at my empty stomach, and I was terrified. And then I looked at the... at the business Travis built. [WOMAN] Mm-hmm. [GRUNTS] [EXHALES] And I was excited! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Who is that? That's the alligator widow. Travis, - he left me a widow... - [PANTING] ... but he also left me... a future. - [CHEERING] - He left me an opportunity. Now, Travis always said, - "Go-getters go get." - Give me your jacket. Well, I got out there, and I got mine, all right. I found myself two plump gators, and I shot 'em in the face. [CROWD CHEERING] And then I skinned 'em, I tanned 'em, and I pulled myself up by my bootstraps. And you better believe they were alligator skin boots. [LOUD CHEERING] I'm doing so well, in fact... I said I'm doing so well, in fact... [CROWD] How well? I'm doing so well that I spend all the time I want in the pool. - [CHEERING] - Living the life of Riley. Yeah! And while I'm in there, I might as well be getting my exercise in. Am I right, girls? [WOMEN CHEERING] Now, I'm not a selfish person. I know what's good for the goose is good for the gander. - Am I right? - [CROWD MURMURING ASSENT] So I give back - every night. - [WOMAN WHOOPS] [CROWD] Every night! - Every night! - Every night! - Every night! - Every night! Every night! Every night! - Every night! - I give back every night, teaching Splashercize down at Rebel Rapids. And, dang, if it doesn't get me pumped to go out there and recruit! - [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] - Uh-huh! It's the key to my success! They told my husband to give everything he had. And he did, so I could get up here and tell y'all that Travis's dream, my dream, didn't end in the swamp. - [WOMAN] No! - It lives on in the pool.

[CHEERING CONTINUES] - [LAUGHING] - [CHEERING] [OBIE] People are hesitant to say yes, but they are terrified to say no. Terrified of what they might miss out on. Terrified of what they might not have. Come on! Join us! Hey, Dad, can I go? Yeah, sure. [OBIE] Which is why they say... "what if." What if I won the lottery? What if I could date the prom queen? What if I could make my dreams come true? [WHOOPING] [DISTORTED] Come on! [OBIE] But a winner doesn't say "what if." A winner says... - "when I." - Yeah! [WHOOPS] [KRYSTAL] Come on! Everybody in! Come on, Ernie! [OBIE] Because "what if" is a pipe dream. "When I" is a promise. - Ernie! Ernie! Ernie! - You give me your pipe dream... - Come on, Dad! - ... and I'll make you - a promise. - All right! All right! You give me your yes, and I'll give you the world. [DISTORTED] Eyes on me! [NORMAL] Okay, and push! Out! Push! Push! ♪ Right in front of my face ♪ ♪ Finally you've come along... ♪ Up! Up! Push! Push! And we're touching our toes, touching our toes, touching our toes, touching our toes. Pray it down. Pray it down. And push. Push. And touch. Touch. Touch. Up. Push. ♪ Finally it's happened to me ♪ ♪ Right in front of my face ♪ ♪ And I just cannot hide it ♪ ♪ Finally... ♪ Hey. Where did all those people come from, huh? That much excitement in this park's never been a good thing. Hey, I'm a walking billboard, Stan. I only cost you two bucks a head. How'd you do that? [SIGHS] I have access to people. Suburban people. They listen to what I have to say, - no matter what. - Okay. But they're gonna want FAM goods stocked here. Now, I have a big order I can fulfill - for you immediately. - Oh, my God. But when that runs out, if those FAM folks don't see more FAM products, they're gonna stop showing up. If this is some sort of joke, I'm not laughing. Now, I have been very nice to you, and if you think you can just walk in here, say what you want about your goddamn FAM, that's not... What are you... No, don't! God! That's not what, um... That's my father's. [SIGHS] Shit. You know, a lot of employees have been getting sick lately, - and, uh, it's just a hygiene issue... - Shh! Buy the inventory. Re-up through me. Spackle your little eye-spy here. You get to keep boosted ticket sales, I get my house back. Win-win. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] $196 for 93 Splashercizers today, and... a check for all this FAM inventory. I thought we agreed on $10,027. I'm not gonna write another one. Pleasure doing business with you, Stan. [CLICKS TONGUE] How was it? It was weird. But it's just another get-rich-quick thing. Oh, I think I might have met the turkey sandwich guy. Gave me investment advice. Not much of a story there though. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Well, well, thanks for checking it out. There was this alligator widow lady though. It'd be a hell of a "Minute." [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Yeah. Cool. Let's talk b...

All right, hold on. ♪ How can we be lovers... ♪ [CHUCKLES] Okay, wait. [GASPS] Oh, shit! [PARROT SCREECHING] Ah, damn, where's the fire extinguisher? [SHOUTS] Oh, damn! What the fuck?! Oh, shit.

And, dang, if it doesn't get me pumped... [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [KEYS JANGLE] Howdy, neighbor. Welcome back. - Hey. - [CHUCKLES] Renovations done? Yeah. Huh. Wow. Eh, looks the same to me. That's how you know they did good. Wow! They did amazing work. [CHUCKLES] Look... when-when Harold and I were in that pool together, splish, splash, I was having a blast. [CHUCKLES] I-I don't know much about FAM, okay? But I do know how I felt when I was in there. I felt... surrounded. Surrounded by... love... and... positivity, by family. Like a warm blanket. That's what I've been missing. It's what Harold needs. Yeah. I want in. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I want to be part of the FAM. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Okay, Ernie. Yeah? We'll get you set up. [BOTH CHUCKLING] [QUIETLY] Thank you. - Have a good night. - You, too. [DOOR CREAKS] [SIGHS]
