 Happy Valley (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - Episode #1.5 - full transcript 
 Catherine and Ann manage to escape and are rescued by the police but Kevin's questionable account of his involvement leads to his arrest and remand in custody whilst - via his phone calls - the arrest of Cowgill, though he enters into a plea bargain for a reduced sentence by giving information about a vast drugs importation racket. As a result he and his family will need witness protection. Catherine recovers in hospital and is visited by Ann, who asks her not to tell her parents about her rape by Royce. On discharge Catherine is depressed and her suspicion of Royce as being Ryan's father leads to her hitting out at the little boy with Clare and Richard giving her assurance of her calming influence on him before there is reconciliation. Royce is hiding out in a seedy flat with Lewis, who wants to inform on him. There is a knife fight and Lewis is killed whilst Royce, severely wounded, staggers off in search of Ryan.

 Can I speak to the detective superintendent, please? I need to talk to him about a kidnap. It's a tiger kidnap, live, ongoing, happening now. Catherine Cawood... Your grandson - is it him that's our Tommy's lad? I'm your dad! You're my son! I knew your mum! Nobody "higher up" is gonna know a single damn thing about this stupid business! If he can prove he is his dad, then he will have rights. It's all your fault!

 What've you done to her?! M-Me? I... It's him! It's him, he's done it, not me! Tell me what's happened. Don't you bloody touch me! Where've you bloody well been?! I'm not trying to touch you, I need to know what's happened. What the hell's happened? Sir, girl in the car says she's been held in a cellar and assaulted for the last four days. Hey, love, you'll be all right now. What's your name? Ann... Gallagher. Who's-Who's done this to my sergeant, Ann? I don't know his name, but he's still in there. He's in the cellar. She sprayed him with something. You and you, round t'back. Shaf, you're going in the ambulance with Catherine. If she speaks, I want to know what she's saying. Stay with t'lass. Everyone else... Check the cellar first, and be careful! I want the on-call DI, I want H-MIT, I want CSI. This is the attempted murder of a police officer. There's nobody down here, sir! She sprayed him! She gassed him! Hello? 'Ashley, it's Tommy.' You all right? She's escaped. What? 'She's escaped.' That bastard policewoman! They've got her. You've got to come and pick me up, you've got to help me. You're on your own, pal. Ashley? Ashley! Shit! Shit! Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Don't tell him I already know what's going on. Just introduce us as being from CID. Right. Kevin. These fellas are from the CID, they want to talk to you. Hi. How do you do? Could you give us a few minutes? Mr Weatherill. Can I call you Kevin? Er, yeah. Y-Yeah, of course. - Hello. - Lewis? Yeah, might be. It's Tommy. I need a lift. I need picking up. Have you got a car you can use? Look, I'll pay you. Do you know anyone who's got a car I can borrow? Where are you? Where did you drop the money off, Kevin? Where did they tell you to drop the money off? Er... Er, McDonald's on the Huddersfield ring road. And then Birch Services on the M62. Whose car did you drive there in? Mine. Both times? Yeah. You're absolutely certain about that? You didn't take Nevison's or... anyone else's? No. No, no. What's your registration number? Erm... VE56... ..CHX. Can you give me, near as you can, specific times when those drops were made? Erm... The first time, Huddersfield ring road, that was... er, Thursday, this last Thursday. Er, around lunchtime. Probably... five past, ten past 12? And the other time? That was... Er, that was Birch Services. Erm, half past ten, quarter to 11, this Monday. And where did you put it? The money. In-in-in-in... In a... Wasn't, like, in a bin, next to a... bin. Was this the Huddersfield ring road or Birch Services? Er... Huddersfield. The second time was in the men's toilets. Can you describe to me where the bins and these toilets are? Where you left the money? You can draw a map or a diagram if it's easier. Yeah, er... Phil Crabtree. Thanks, bye-bye. Can you just give me a minute, Kevin? Has something happened? We've got her. She's safe. Huh! Jesus. So he knew where she was? No, I've just had a phone call. Do you want to ring Helen? She's asking for her mother. Where is she? Local. They're taking her to hospital in Halifax. For a checkup. It's routine. Have they caught the bastards? That's as much as I know at the minute. So-So he didn't know? We're still having that conversa... Helen! Hello, love. They've found her! She's safe! Boss. There's no ANPR on this fella's vehicle at either of the two drop-off points he's mentioned, at any point over the last four days. You were telling me which bin you put the money next to. Yeah. I, er... It-It-It's difficult to explain. Erm... OK. Well, the thing is, Kevin... I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and demanding money with menaces. No, that's... Why?! You're wrong! You've got the wrong end of the stick! You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand what I'm saying, Kevin? Yes, but... I-I... Is this your mobile phone? Come on, Mum! Come on! Mum, come on! No! You'll love it. It's beautiful, it's perfect! Just let go, Mummy! Mummy! She's become extremely tachycardic. Is everything OK down there? She is becoming very unstable. Packs. Quickly. Her abdomen's full of blood, she's bleeding out. The spleen's gone. Get the suction. What do we know? No more than I told you on the phone. She's still in theatre. I don't know where she is. They showed me in here. They said it could be hours. Why? They're having to remove her spleen. Why?! Well, she... Somebody beat her up. Who? I don't know. Well, what... What does that mean, your spleen? What does that do? I don't... I have no... You know as much as I do. What was she doing? Just what I've said. That's all I know. Is there someone to talk to? They keep popping in. Are you all right? Yeah. I just... I don't know what to do with meself. Are you not in t'salon today? Yeah, I'm down there now. This is a hologram. What's up? I might... I might pop out for a bit. You've been at it again. After everything that's been said. Ashley Cowgill? I'm Detective Constable Christine Whittaker. Can I come in? What's it to do with? You all right if I come in? Is this your wife? Yeah, she's... What's the matter? What's going on? OK, Ashley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and demanding money with menaces. What?! You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court. That's... You can't, th... Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Are you with me, Ashley? Have you taken that in? I haven't... I didn't... This isn't me. Why would he do something like that? We've got caravans! We've got a games room that caters for people in wheelchairs! Ryan, your grandad's here. Hiya, Ryan. And your stepgran, Ros. Hello! You're going to be going home with them today because your granny's had to go into hospital. And your Auntie Clare's with her, so... OK. Do you want to have another go at football in our back garden? See if you can teach me a few new moves? Why's she in hospital? She's had a bit of an accident at work. Yeah. Is she all right? She's going to be absolutely fine, love. 'The two wanted men have been named as Tommy Lee Royce and Lewis Whippey. 'Abduh Rehman reports from West Yorkshire. 'This morning, two arrests were made and two more men are wanted for questioning, '28-year-old Tommy Lee Royce and 22-year-old Lewis Whippey, 'both with previous convictions for car theft and drug offences. 'A manhunt was launched this morning involving over 200 officers 'from the Yorkshire Police. 'A spokesman warned both men may be armed and dangerous 'and should not be approached.' I'm not armed. I'm-I'm-I'm not dangerous! Oi, you, speccy four-eyes! You listening? Sh! '..as well as all ports and airports. 'However, we have reason to believe 'that the two men have not left the locality. 'Anyone helping these two men through some misguided sense of loyalty 'should be in no doubt as to the seriousness of the crimes 'they've committed, 'the brutal murder of PC Kirsten McAskill, 'the attempted murder of Sergeant Catherine Cawood, 'who this evening remains in a critical condition in hospital, 'and the abduction of Ann Gallagher.' They're gonna do house-to-house, door-to-door, then what? I'll think of summat. 'To Tommy Lee Royce and Lewis Whippey, I would like to say - 'there is no safe haven, you will not escape justice.' Twat. Could you eat something? No. I don't know. Should I? You need to take the Subutex. Yeah, yeah. What were they asking you? I don't want to go through all that again. Oh, that's fine. I want to go and see Clare's sister. She's going to let us know when you can visit. I'll... I'll go and put the kettle on. Mm... Mm... Catherine? Mm... Mm... Catherine? Mm... Hello. Daniel's here. And there's a detective outside needs to talk to you. About what happened. No shit. We've been here all day. All day? Why, what time is it? Knocking on for midnight. You've been asleep, you've had an anaesthetic. Why? The doctors are going to come and explain everything to you. Explain everything to me? Why? Have I died? No! You just need to take things steady for a few days, that's all. Do you remember what happened? You got Ann Gallagher out alive. You saved her life. Is she all right? Yeah. Physically, she's... And oh, my God, do Helen and Nevison love you! I've had a phone call. He said, "If there's ever anything we can do..." I said, "Well, if you fancied paying off the mortgage!" They said you were losing blood. Internally. That was why they had to take you into the operating theatre. You were in there for five hours. More. They've all been very kind. Mum? How're you feeling? Hello, love. How're you feeling? What do I look like? You're... bruised. Mum, there's a detective from H-MIT outside. He wants to talk to you about what happened. Oh... Y-You all right? I got him, though, eh? I got the bastard. The big news is we are this close to proving the people that abducted Ann Gallagher were the same people who murdered Kirsten McAskill. God almighty. You were right about Milton Avenue. We picked Ashley Cowgill up around lunchtime. Ann's told us she was held in a caravan for two nights after they removed her from Milton Avenue. She was in Milton Avenue. I fast-tracked the swabs you authorised. We found DNA from Ann, Tommy Lee Royce, and the blood... is from a lad called Lewis Whippey. Lewis Whippey. I collared him for nicking a motor when he were 15. Ann Gallagher's identified them both in the Viper suite as the men who abducted her. Back to Cowgill. He's the registered owner of a white van. The same make, model and year that'd been at the scene where Kirsten died. It was stolen, the van, last week. Did you report it to the police? No. What'd have been t'point? You'd not do owt about it. Well, for the insurance, at least. It wasn't worth owt, wasn't worth the hassle. It was a shit heap. He's denying everything, of course. Doesn't know Tommy or Lewis from Adam. But we've got Telecoms analysing his phone. It's just a matter of time. And we took the dogs in. They sniffed out 20 kilos of cannabis stashed in one of his caravans. Course, he didn't know anything about that either. Wow. There is some... ..less good news, however, I'm afraid. Tommy Lee Royce is still on his toes, and so is Lewis Whippey. No... No... What-what do you mean? He... I sprayed him, I blinded him! He were in the cellar, he was helpless, he were... PolSA's pulled that house apart. Believe me. They've been in there all day. He must've managed to slip out before the first emergency vehicles pulled up. No. We will get him, Catherine. He can't have got far. I won't become addicted. I refuse. Good. I wanted... ..to ask you to do something for me. What? I don't want my mum to know. I want her to die not knowing. Not knowing...? He raped you. I don't want her to know. Ever. Ever. Ever. And I can't tell my dad that. I tried to, last night, but I couldn't. I... I wanted to, but... ..I don't want him picturing... I don't want to see him picturing... But he will need to know. Eventually. When it goes to court. And it will go to court, I will see those people in court. My mother... I think they think it's unlikely she'll live that long. And they said it could be eight months before it gets to court, and if she never needs to know, that's... that's... ..that's how I'd like it. My dad... he will need to know. Before. And... You want me to tell him? OK. Really? Yeah. When I get out of here. Can you wait that long? They took swabs, the police doctors did, before they let me see my mum and dad, so... they've got everything they needed. And they will get him. Yeah. I hope so. Hi, Mike! Clare. How are you? Not so bad. Is Catherine not up? Yeah, she should be. I took her up a cup of tea before I left. And she's under strict instructions not to wallow in bed all day. Come on in. I won't stop long. I'll stick t'kettle on. Oh, you're up! Catherine! I was knocking on t'door. You've not started smoking again? No, it's me. She just has th'odd one. How're you feeling? I'm all right. I was just popping in to say... you... You've probably seen what's on the front of a couple of the tabloids? I've spoken to the District Commander. He wanted me to assure you there's no intelligence whatsoever to suggest that he's got out of the country. But if the twisted bastard'd done it successfully, there wouldn't be, would there? You think the press'd know that and we wouldn't? It wouldn't be t'first time. We will get him. Yeah. Do you know how many... tossers in uniform have said that to her over t'last three weeks? Did you make an appointment with the psychologist? She told her to put all her troubles in little envelopes. And to put the little envelopes into a little box. And to put it in the attic till she felt strong enough to open it up again. She meant well. Kevin Weatherill's having a bad time on remand. His cell-mate took a shine to him. You know what it's like inside wi' some of these Neanderthals. Every hole's a goal. He's been hospitalised with his injuries, apparently. Jesus. Sorry. But the other thing is that Ashley Cowgill's up for Judge in Chambers bail this week and the rumour is he's going to get it. How come? Has he done a deal? That's... Yeah. More than likely what's happened here. What's that mean? It means he has information that could be useful. To the NCA, I'd imagine. In return for a reduced sentence, probably. And bail. Does that really happen? Well, we're speculating. But, yes. It really happens. There is some good news. You wouldn't normally be told this in advance. Normally the first you'd hear is when you got a Royal Warrant from t'Palace. The District Commander asked me to let you know - he thought it might give you a boost. He's put your name forward for the Queen's Police Medal for bravery. That's big, Catherine. There's only two other serving officers in the whole of West Yorkshire who've got it. You'll have to go and shake hands and curtsey. Right. I think he's holed up, Tommy Lee Royce, right under our noses. I think, when we find him, he'll have been holed up in t'same spot all along. It's only a matter of time. I'll see myself out. Ta-ta. Will you pick Ryan up at tea time? He was asking again this morning, "When's Granny going to start picking me up again?" He just wants... everything to get back to normal. Can you drive me up to Heptonstall? Not again. Fine. I'll walk. I'll drive you. I'll walk. You can't walk. You can't walk that far. It's your birthday next week. Do you fancy doing something? No, not really. We could have a little do. Just family. A few friends. Or we could go out. For a meal. Just a few of us. Somewhere nice. Hm? I can't believe I wasn't at Kirsten's funeral. Catherine, you were poorly. You couldn't stand up. She'd be wondering why I wasn't there. Who would? Kirsten. I don't think I'd be able to do it again. On the bus. I think in future, if I can't get a lift, I'll just have to stay at home. OK. We've had more nonsense through the letter box. A dead bird crawling with maggots. As well as the other filth. I haven't been back. My dad went round to pick up a few more bits and pieces. So I think I'm just going to stay there now. At their house. With the girls. I think that's best. Could your dad not... drive you over here? He won't, Kevin. He doesn't want me to come. That's... You've got to make it clear to him it wasn't my fault. Any of it. What do you mean? Think about it. If I hadn't seen that block of cannabis, whatever, drop out of that sandbag, then none of it would... It would never have occurred to me. Would it? And if... Nevison had done the decent thing in the first place. when I asked him for a rise, then none of it, again, none of it would've happened. I made a mistake. Maybe, I flipped, God knows, but... And then you... Me? Oh, come on! You encouraged me. I... Maybe not to start with. But you did. You did! "Let's split it up into smaller amounts, "just a few hundred pounds each, in different bank accounts." I was just trying to make some sense of the mess that you'd made! Don't you blame me. Don't you dare blame me! You've just got to explain to people that it wasn't entirely... These things don't happen in isolation. That's the point. Surely, any of us, any one of us, could find ourselves in a situation not entirely of our own... and-and... I shouldn't have to explain this! You know what I'm saying! 'It's been almost four weeks, Superintendant, 'and these men are still out there. 'A number of newspapers ran a front-page story this morning 'suggesting Tommy Lee Royce had been seen in Spain. 'What can you say to assure the people of West Yorkshire, and beyond, 'that these violent criminals will be brought to justice? 'Well, first I'd like to assure people that we remain confident 'that they will be caught, and that it's simply a matter of time. 'What you do have to appreciate with an inquiry of this nature is 'just how much work goes on behind the scenes. 'And yet they're still out there. 'And the search goes on, and it'll continue to go on...' They're doing this block. Right now, knocking on doors. Shit. Shit! We knew this would happen. Just calm right down! They're on the first couple of floors, the cocky bastards, and there's a fair good few of 'em. I-I need a piss! So, go, then! It'll take 'em a while to get here. Won't it? Probably. I dunno. Why have you got so much shopping? Well, cos... Didn't you ask me...? No. When the idiots are in here asking stupid little questions. Why have you got so much shopping? Oh! It's for me mum. She can't get out and about so much... these days, what with her legs. Good lad. Yeah. You know what to do. Afternoon. Is it all right if we step inside for a few minutes? We're doing a house-to-house in the area, and I'd just like to ask you one or two questions. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course you can. Come in. Is it all right if my colleague has a little look round whilst we're just having a chat? Yep. No problem. Who lives in the property? Besides yourself? No-one. How long have you lived here? Probably... like...18 months? And the tenancy's registered in your name? Yeah. Do you know your neighbours? On either side. Yeah. Who lives on this side? Oh, they're weird. Mucky as well, and it stinks. I mean, I know I could use a bit of a tidy up, but at least I can flush my toilet. Hmm. Have you not been in there, then? They're not answering their door at the minute. What's the point of an 'ouse to 'ouse if half of 'em don't answer their doors? Oh, we just have to keep coming back till they do. You'd think they didn't want to help you, wouldn't you? No, they're just not all in when we call, but like I say, we'll be back. So, who lives there, next door? How many of them? Er... It wouldn't have happened if she hadn't called me a loser. Granny? She goes, "You're a loser, Ryan." I told Mrs Mukherjee, but she wouldn't take any notice, so... So? So you're admitting now that it was you that ripped up this kid's painting? It wasn't reet good. Did you rip up the painting? I might of. I might have. Not of. You couldn't of done any thing, of isn't a verb. And don't blame other people for decisions that you make. You made the decision to rip up the painting! Whatever the hell else happened, whatever she called you, you made that decision. When? When? When can I ever pick you up from that bloody place without the constant threat of being hauled in and made to feel this big and like a rubbish parent? Because I am not a rubbish parent! You are lucky to have me! And you better start showing me some respect by behaving properly or... or there'll be consequences. And you won't like them. What consequences? Granny! Where is he? No idea. What... what's up? Oh, the usual. Behaving like an idiot and then lying. I hate you! Yes, I know, I'm under no illusions. You keep telling me. Bitch! You're an old bitch! You're an ugly old bitch! You better do something with him, cos I'll just kill him. I think you both need to calm down. I don't even want to live here! What's happened? Good. Move out. See if anyone else is daft enough to have you. Please! Feel free, cos you've ruined me and your Auntie Clare's life long enough. I'm ringing Childline. Yeah, they'll be interested. I'm reporting you! Do you want the number? Cow! Bitch! Wanker! Wanker. That's new. Perhaps it was a bit soon for you to go picking him up. Looks like it. You can't talk to him like that. I've had enough. I had enough years ago. It's not normal, is it? I don't know! I don't know what's happened! I've done everything! We both have! And look at him! Ssh! Why did I do it? Shut up, Catherine! Richard. My marriage. Everything. And for what? A psychopath. Stop it! Right, well, there you go. He's trashing his bedroom, wrecking our house. My house. What are you doing? I'm trashing my bedroom! You're not trashing your bedroom! I hate her! No, you don't. I thought... I thought they'd bloody moved in! I thought they'd never leave! Why did you sit on me? I thought it'd look convincing. You knob! I couldn't breathe! You've dislocated me shoulder! I'm friggin' freezing! I've gotta get Tommy out. Leave him! Eh? Leave him a bit longer. Don't be stupid. Brett, Brett, Brett! Listen to me! Listen! I did not kill that police woman. And I did not rape Ann Gallagher. I did not beat up that other one! I am not going down for those things! Let's go, let's get the police now, let's tell 'em. Grass him up? It's not about grassing him up! It's about me and you getting in deep shit, because we're hiding him and we don't need to be! He's a nutter! Not happening. You're not even his friend. You're my friend. Not happening. Why? Why? They've gone, big fella. She does love you. She loves you more than you could ever begin to imagine. What you've got to try and get your head round - and you're only eight, and it's difficult, and that's fine. What you've got to understand is that Granny's... She's still poorly, and she's going to get better, she's going to be absolutely fine. But sometimes, you can be poorly in your head as well as in your body. Do you mean like... mental? No, Ryan. She's not mental. She's depressed. And that sometimes means that someone isn't quite their self, and I think we just have to be kind to her, like she's kind to you, normally, when you're angry and upset. And that's what's going to help her get better. Am I adopted? Well, no... Not... I mean, she's your real granny and I'm your real auntie. What do you mean? Who was that man who said he was my dad? No-one. No-one. He's not your dad. Your dad's dead. What about tidying this room? Hm? Do you want some tea? I've broken the kettle. Well, I can boil some water in a pan. And then, tomorrow, you can go out and buy us a new one. It'll give you something to do. Is he all right? Are you? Open it. Is the incorrect response. I'm not in the mood, Julie! Join the club, pal. All right. Thanks for picking me up. I'm sorry I've... I'm sorry. I am sorry. I'm sorry for everything. How are the boys? You smell like a lag. Let's go home. Have you done a deal? Can we just get home? I want to know... if you've sold us down the river. I'll explain it all to you when we get home. Thank you for helping Clare with Ryan when I was in hospital. He's all right. I can't stand him. Sorry? I can't stand him. What are you talking about? Ryan. I can't stand looking at him. Why are you saying that? No, I understand it. I get what it was. I get why you couldn't live in the same house. I get it. I get it. Believe me, I get it. You can't... You can't say that. Can't I? Why? Because you made the choice. Why didn't I listen to you? You can't say that, Catherine. Do you want him? No! I mean, I would, but you... you don't mean this. The times I've had to sit and listen to the stupid, mindless, idiotic things he's done at that school. Daniel was never like that! Becky was never like that! Where's it come from? Hm? It's not rocket science, is it? Yeah. And it's still not his fault either, is it? I thought you said he was dyslexic? He's daft. Catherine, if he's dyslexic, he will get angry and frustrated. It doesn't mean he's... like his dad. Yeah, but... What? But what? He's bound to be at some level. He's just bound to be, in't he? Tommy Lee Royce, right? I don't even think he's a psychopath, not a real one. I think he is this little twisted thing who grew up unloved. More than unloved, despised probably, treated like dirt on a daily basis in squalor and chaos. Ryan is loved. Cared for. He has not grown up in either squalor or chaos, thanks to you. There's a massive, massive difference! And yeah, part of him will always inevitably be Tommy Lee bloody Royce, but part of him will always be Becky. And a bigger part of him will be you. And Clare. Because you're the people who've had most influence on him! And I understand it's tough from time to time, but kids are a nightmare. All kids, any kid, they all have their moments. You know this. Blimey! Becky, she used to drive us up the flaming... Don't! It's kind of interesting to hear you defending him. Daniel rang me last night. Clare had rung him. She was worried. About you. That's... that's why I asked you out. What are you doing for your birthday next week? Same as I do every year. Nothing. That's not true. We used to do... We... Why am I even here? Sorry? For the last eight years, I have not celebrated my birthday. Course, you wouldn't know that, because you divorced me. Ever since Becky died, do you know how...? You must, she was your daughter too, maybe it's different for men. I've got no idea. But do you know how perverse it is that people think you want to celebrate your own existence when you've got a child who's dead? No offence, but I carried her for nine months in here. Her flesh was my flesh, and she's dead. Part of me is dead. Physically dead. I thought I'd come to terms with it, and I haven't, I never will, and why the hell Clare's got this obsession with celebrating my birthday, I do not know. Catherine, it's not an obsession. She's just trying to focus on it to... Cheer me up! People are trying to help you, because they love you. And at the moment, it feels like they're hitting a brick wall. There you go. Thanks. Thanks. I have to go. We've just... got food. I don't want you to ring me up any more. We should never have got back into bed together, it was stupid. You don't have to do that. Catherine... Catherine! Hello? Catherine? It's Phil. Crabtree. Oh, er, hello. How are you? Fine. I'm fine. I wondered if you wanted to be brought up to speed with where we're at. I think you might find it interesting. Ashley Cowgill was let out on bail this morning. What's the story? Can I trust you? I don't know. What do you think? While he was on remand, he indicated he had information that would make the National Crime Agency wet themselves with excitement. Well, yeah... I assumed it'd be something of that sort. Cowgill, many moons ago, worked on the importation side. Have you heard of Gathercoles? Pharmaceuticals? They've got factories in the North East and Scotland. Completely legitimate. OK. They import all sorts of refined chemicals from all over, and one thing they do import is paracetamol. From a Spanish company based in Almeria. The hauliers bring the product up through Spain, up through France, into Holland in trucks. The trucks go from Rotterdam to Hull, then onto the North East and Scotland. Eight or nine of them, every week, carrying up to 500 kilos of paracetamol in each. Yeah? But before they leave Rotterdam, every other lorry visits another factory in Dordrecht. On a daily basis, a number of lorries pull in at this place and the driver is paid £25 a kilo to wander over there and have a fag. One drum in every load is taken out, partially emptied, refilled with exactly the same weight in cocaine and shipped to England. In England, the reverse happens. As soon as the lorry's away from the docks, the cocaine's taken out and the paracetamol's put back in. That's 25 kilos of cocaine coming into the UK up to four times a week. And how do you know all this isn't Tales of the Arabian Nights? We're confident he hasn't made the whole thing up. So, if it is true, that's... Catherine. It's huge. You've facilitated a link to a team of drug dealers with a distribution network in the UK worth millions. Ultimately, some serious players are going to have their assets frozen. And they're going to want to know who's opened their mouth. Ashley Cowgill may have bought himself a reduced sentence, but him and his family'll be on the witness protection programme for ever. He'll be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life. I don't believe what you're telling me. We'll be fine. What about the salon? There'll be other salons. What about me mum and dad? My family. Everything! God, you really have sold us down the river! I'm sorry I've been an arse. You're not an arse. Where have you been? Richard rang. Oh. Oh, that was a mistake, I should never have got back into all that. You all right? Yep. Sure? Yeah, I were thinking, um... maybe I should... maybe we should... for my birthday... do... Nothing big, but... OK. OK, yeah. What about Helen and Nevison and Ann? Yeah. If... Yeah. When you going to tell Nevison about Ann? Well, when... when I... I'll do it tomorrow. Where's Ryan? What's this? Zombies. Oh, nice. Are you warm enough? You see? This is why I spend half my time round at our Marie's. It's just to keep warm. Although... with all this, er, this cash you've got... Tommy? If you wanted me to get it switched on again, the heating... What's happened? Where've you been? What's happened? He come at me with a knife! When? Last night. Shit! Shit! The ungrateful bastard! They'd have caught him by now. They'd have had him if it hadn't been for me! Shit! I need some pills. What pills? Painkiller pills! Tommy! You're going to die, man! You need to got to hospital! Shit! What am I going to do? I need some... bandages or... No. OK, but... That's not bandages, that's... You're going to... I think, Tommy, it's the end of the road, mate. Buddy, you gotta hand yourself in! We could've got away with this. All we had to do was bide our time. The dopey twats were clueless. You've done really well, Tommy. I can't believe it! Just cos of that dozy feckless piece of shite! What a way to go, eh? No, you'll be fine. You're not going nowhere, Tommy. I'm not going to an hospital, I'm not... I'm not handing myself in. But you... It... it... it's over. It's over, I know, but... no way am I handing myself in. Do you want a beer? Er... I could've been someone, me. I could've done stuff. You still can, Tommy. Ashley Cowgill. He's nothing compared to what I could've done. I had ideas, I had plans. I could've rocked the world. Why don't you just let me go and ring for an ambulance? No, no, no. I just want you to go and get me some pain killers. That's all. Why? I've got a... kid. Did you know that? A boy. He don't know me. He... He lives in Hebden Bridge. With that bitch that gassed me. She's his granny. How mad is that? What...? What kind of life is that for a lad, eh? Living with an old woman and no dad. It... it's not... It's not... Shit! Oh, shit! It's no life, not for a lad. What do you want me to do about him? Who? Him! Do you want me to give him a good kicking before he wakes up? No. You... you don't need to give him a good kicking. He isn't...? You didn't really think he was asleep? You... Oh, you've slit his... Oh, Jesus! Hey... You're not going to go weird on me, Brett, are you? Oh, oh... Come on, you're not... You're not chicken shit like him. Are you? Hey, shut your mouth! Shut your mouth! Ssh! Shut... Come on, don't want you to be late for school. Sorry I've not been much fun lately. It's all right. Morning. Morning. I miss your mum sometimes, that's all. Why are you crying? It just happens when you get to my age. It'll be reet. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
