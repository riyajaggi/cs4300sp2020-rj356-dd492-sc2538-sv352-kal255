 Some bastard's got our Annie and he wants a million quid. -50,000. -We'd just have to be careful that it didn't look like we suddenly had a lot of money to throw around. What could they be doing in a van that was so bad that they had to kill a police officer? It's all your fault! You arrested Marcus Gascoigne yesterday. -He does a lot for us. -Nobody is above the law. I think he's had someone in there. Are you a virgin?

 I've just broken into a house. The fact that I'm a police officer don't make it legal. Shaf, can you get onto the council and find out who owns number 62 Milton Avenue? -Sowerby Bridge? -Yeah. -Boss? -Catherine. -Have you got a minute? -Sure. OK. I saw this lad, Tommy Lee Royce, been trying to catch up with him for a few days, he's just done eight years, drugs. I was hoping to give him the welcome-home speech. So I knocked on at this house where I know he's been dossing. No answer, but I had reason to believe, so I accessed the property via ways and means and...

 ..I found blood in the cellar, a chair covered in gaffer tape, like somebody'd been tied to it, a pair of knickers on the floor, so that and knowing what a charming young man Tommy Lee Royce is, makes me want to get a CSI - SOCO, CSI, whatever we're calling them this week - get one of them in there to take a few swabs, a few photos -and find out what's going on. OK. -What, so that's... -Yep. Did you go to the H-MIT briefing in Halifax this morning? I did, yes. M-CET's worked out there were two vehicles involved. Pathologist says she was crushed to death. Run over. More than once. There was plenty of debris on the road, paint fragments, fragments from the number plate, tyre marks. They'll soon identify what make, model, year of manufacture. Endless phone calls from the public. They won't get far, you watch this space. How is everyone? They're gutted, they're in shock. Are you all right? I'm fine. Effed off, insecure, neurotic and emotional, I'm fine, but other than that, yeah. You better get onto the CSI, then, see what this Tommy Lee Jones has been up to. Yeah, it's Royce. Tommy Lee Royce. Happy Valley Season 1 - Episode 04 Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd Sync: Marocas62 Julie Mulligan. Registered freeholder of 62 Milton Avenue. Her address is Upper Lighthazels Farm. Thornton Clough Lane, Soyland. Her mobile number - do you want it? Put a request in for a CSI to meet us at Milton Avenue as soon as. Then I want you to get up there, tape it off and wait for them, OK? I was going off on the house-to-house with this lot. -For Kirsten. -Do this first. And knock on a few doors. See if anyone's seen any comings or goings, or heard anything. And trawl the box, see if we've got anything on the address. Did the boss go to the H-MIT briefing this morning? Yeah, she was run over. More than once. Crushed to death. Hello. Am I speaking to Julie Mulligan? -Yes. -Hiya. This is Sergeant Cawood here, down at Norland Road police station. There's something I think you can help with. I'm just wondering if I could pop in and have a chat? -Yeah. -Are you all right? Why? When? Has something happened? Any time. Soon. Now. What's it to do with? Put your head between your knees. Hello? Right... The thing is, Nevison... The thing is... I may be wrong... I may be wrong, but the thing is... ..I think I might know who these people are. -Did you see anything? -No. No. I-I didn't. The thing is, Nevison... Will you let me know if... When... When they let go of her? Just so I know. Even if it's in the middle of the night. -Yeah. -I'd just like to know. I know you'll have a lot of other things to think about -when it happens... -Of course I will, Kevin. Go back to your desk. Nothing we can do. The thing is... What? I get frightened going there, and... I understand that, Kevin. And it's fine! It's for Ann, I get that! I appreciate what you're doing for me... Believe me. Yeah. Yeah, I know you do. Look, I have to be honest with you. It's in my name for tax reasons, and I don't actually have a lot to do with it, so... That's all right. Who does it have something to do with? I don't mean anything illegal. It's literally cos I pay less tax than he does - me husband. So... plan was he'd do it up, we'd rent it out, only surprise, surprise, he's never got his backside into gear, so... And what's your husband's name? Where can I find him? -What's happened? -I just need to talk to him about one of his tenants. He has no tenants. There are no tenants. There's never been any tenants. Not there. Not that I know of. It's been stood empty. What's his name? Hello, my little orange blossom. You better not be up to anything, you pig. -Me? -You've got a copper coming to see you. What copper? A policewoman. -How do you know? -She's just been in here, just now. Shit! So... Well... Something about the house on Milton Avenue. It's been broken into. -Broken...? -Have you been doing something dodgy in there? No! What did she say? -And there's no tenants, is there? -No. No, no tenants. Somebody's broken in, and she needs to talk to you. -Nobody's br... -Right, well, she's coming, and you're in bother, you bastard... -Why am I... -If you've been up to something, I am not, not, visiting you in prison. I don't even know what you're on about. Why am I up to something just cos some... toerag's decided to break into some property? Yeah, that's right, Ashley, you're talking to the woman that were born last week! These bags are shit. Give it here. OK. I want you to go stay in the caravan with Tommy and her. -And keep it down. -Why? There's a policewoman coming over. I will deal with it. -What policewoman? -Just both... How the bloody hell do I know? You both stay in there till I come and tell you she's been and gone. All right? I don't want to hear a peep out of anyone. No noise, no movement. If that little chicken-shit rat-faced turd -has been to the police... -He hasn't. He won't have. Do you think they'd send one woman if they knew owt? -Well, they must know summat. -He hasn't been to the police, all right? He's in this just as deep as anyone. No. He isn't. Because he hasn't got his hands mucky. He doesn't have to sit in that caravan. She's coming from Halifax, she'll be here in ten minutes. There's a policewoman coming to the farm, so we've to keep quiet till she's gone. What policewoman? Not the one I saw? How the hell do I know? Where's your balaclava? We don't really need 'em any more, do we? Little numpty-brain. What? What you done to her? I've gave her a bit of smack. Keep her docile. She needs gag on. She keeps being sick. Unless you want her to choke? She won't scream. She can't. -Morning. -Are you busy? I've got a few minutes. Go on. Right. Well, I've got some information for you about drugs in the valley, and you're right, it would make a fantastic article, and it does need writing about. Good. You wouldn't believe the chain there is before it gets onto the streets. I would. Heroin is imported pure. 100%. And then they all cut it, everyone who handles it, all the way down the chain, to maximise their profits as they go. By the time it gets to the streets, street heroin, it's probably no more than 2% pure. -No, really? -And they'll cut it with anything. Brick dust. Brick dust! face powder, talcum powder, bicarbonate of soda, so when they've been injecting for long enough, if the veins haven't collapsed, they get blocked. Then they start having to have their legs amputated. Yup. And up and down this chain, they're all frightened of the person above. However high up they are, there's always someone above pushing them to take more and more and more. So they have to push those under them to take more and more and more. And you know, your big regional dealers - and the people further down the chain - they'll be people who appear to be perfectly respectable, with perfectly respectable businesses. It's all very slick, it's all very well organised. I've got to go. Can I ring you later? OK. I'm glad you're doing this. -Sure. -See ya. Bye. -Morning. -Ashley Cowgill? Yep. I've just spoken to your wife regarding your property on Milton Avenue. She just rung me. I need to inform you that we've had reason to enter the property... -Why? -..and I need to ask you a couple of questions, -OK? -Yeah, but why... Why... Why did you have to...? -Someone's broken in. -When? Were you aware the property was insecure? No. When did you last visit the property yourself? Well... It'll be two or three months since, now. And your wife says you've no tenants at the minute. No, no. Never had any. I've not got round to sorting it out. Who has keys to the property besides yourself? Nobody... should have. Have they damaged it? Have they nicked the boiler? Has it been flooded? -Have they left shit everywhere? -So... No, not that I know of. So no-one that you know of - no-one officially - was in there? -Yeah? -Yeah. No. No, they weren't. OK. Well, I have to be frank with you, Mr. Cowgill. We've got reason to believe that something a bit sinister's gone on in there. In your house. In this house that you and your wife own. Whoa. What d'you mean? What sort of sinister? I don't know. I've got a scene-of-crime officer in there right now taking a few swabs and a few photographs. What it looks like to me is that someone's been held in there against their will and treated rather unpleasantly. -Bloody hell. -Yeah. So, we've had a couple of releases from prison in the area over the last few weeks, and I was wondering if any of these names were familiar to you. Zak Midgeley? -Jamie Monkford. -No. Usman Farah. Tommy Lee Royce. Should they be familiar to me? -Are they? Any of them? -No. These lads are all in their 20s. Do you employ anyone or had contact with anyone that age who might associate with lads like that? -Newly released from prison? -No. No, no. We'll be finished at the property in an hour or so. You might want to go in there when we're done and... make sure it's secure. If anything occurs to you... ..that might be relevant, -will you give me a ring? -Sure. Thanks for your time. Well, thanks for telling me. What are you building? Just renovating this barn. It's been going on months. Cos part of it's listed, they make you jump through hoops. I'll be in touch. -How we doing? -CSI's here. Just going in just now. I've told them what you want doing, and I've filmed all the upstairs with the head-cam. Kitchen, sitting room? Yeah, and the upstairs upstairs. So I'm just gonna knock on a few doors now. Great. I'll be there in ten minutes. Just got another house call to make. I'm popping in on Tommy Lee Royce's mother, -OK? -Who? Newly released. Then I'll be with you. Hello, Lynn. I'm Catherine Cawood. Got a few minutes? I'll be honest with you, if it's about our Tommy, I haven't seen him. This is his registered release address. Well, I've seen him, if you know what I mean, but... Sit down. He doesn't live here. I don't know where he lives. When did you last see him? About three weeks ago, when he came out. He stopped here one night and then he were off. Gone. I don't know where. -Have you got a mobile number for him? -Nope. No, he don't have one. Well, he probably has one, do you know what I mean? But if he has, I don't know owt about it. -Who does he hang about with? -Nobody. I don't know. People. I don't know. Has he done summat? -If you see him... -Stupid question. If you see him... He's only been out three week. If you see him, can you tell him that I need to see him? Sergeant Cawood. Catherine Cawood. And to pop down to Norland Road nick at his earliest convenience. It's unlikely that I will see him, but if I do, I will, yeah. -OK. -Right. -You'll remember? -I'll try. And tell him it'd be much better for him if he pops in to see me without me having to go looking for him the next time he has a meeting with his probation officer. OK? He'll be here when he wants summat, do you know what I mean? You never know when that's going to be, do you know what I mean? So you'll pass on that message for me, Lynn? Yep. All right. -You look after yourself. -And you too. -I'll see myself out. -Are you...? What? Am I what? Catherine Cawood... Is it you that's... Your grandson, is it him that's our Tommy's lad? Who's told you that? -Is he called Ryan? -Who's told you that? Somebody mentioned it down in Hebden the other day. -Who? -Friend of a friend. -Who? -I don't know. Somebody. I don't know, I can't remember. Well, who were you with? -Well, you wouldn't know 'em. -Try me. Well, you would. The usual smackheads. Sorry. They don't like being called smackheads, but they are. Your Tommy has got nothing to do with my grandson. All right? -I were only saying. -You need to get that idea right out of your head. -Right. -Right. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Why don't we draw straws? Because I'm not doing it, that's why not. Why not? It's your turn. You must know somebody. Higher up. Someone who can make people disappear. -Do you think? -Gary Gaggoski. He disappeared. Tony Stead says he's sat at the bottom of Scammonden dam in concrete underpants. Nobody higher up is going to know a single damned thing about this stupid business, because the second they do, it's me they'll... We were moonlighting, we were out of our depth, it shouldn't have happened. D'you think I want people higher up thinking we're a liability? -It were your idea. -All right! It wasn't my idea to murder a policewoman, was it? You should get him round here. Kevin shitty-arse twat-face! Make him do it, make him get his hands all covered in blood. -Yeah, well, I'm tempted. -Rub his stupid nose in it. Have you ever killed anybody? Me? Sod off. Have I hell. If you both give me five grand each... ..from that last stash Kevin brought over... ..I'll do it. -How? -It don't matter how. Deal or no deal? You're not going to do to her what you did to that policewoman. Aren't I? Yeah. OK. Deal. I'll need a van. Not a white one. I don't want pulling over. OK. And then, when it's done, you two, you need to disappear. All right? -Are you sacking us? -I'm advising you to move on. You've got your stash from Kevin, so move on. You're sacking us. What do you know? Fella said he saw a white transit van parked down here, outside the property, like, four days ago. That's about it. A white transit van? Yeah. Then again, how many white transit vans are there in Halifax? It'd be a bit of a coincidence, wouldn't it? I'll flag it up to H-MIT, they might want to check any CCTV. Do you want me to knock on a few more doors? No. I'll just pop down to the cellar and have a word with the CSI, then we'll leave it at that. Hiya. You said to let you know if Helen turned up. Well, she's just got here. Just now. I've got another three hours on duty. Right, OK. Will she still be there at half four-ish? Well, I'd have thought so. She sometimes gets tired, but yeah. Right, I'll see you later. You should have dropped him round at Janina's, he could've played with Cesco. -Where is she? -She's just there with Smiffy. He's got an appointment with social services at ten to five, so if you want to grab her, I'll bring you over a cup of tea. Helen? Hello. I'm Catherine, I'm Clare's sister. We spoke on the phone last night. Yes. Yes, she said you were coming to pick her up. -I'm sorry I didn't... -No, no. I hope you don't mind, only I was worried about you. And... Sorry, I know this is awkward, and I know you've not been well, but is your husband hurting you? -My husband? -Look, I don't want to overstep the mark and I'm sorry if I've got the wrong end of the stick, but last night, when you said, "I'm with my husband," it occurred to me that maybe you couldn't speak, and maybe that was your way of telling me, and I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't ask... No. My husband isn't hurting me. Are you sure? I know people think he's a bit of a rough diamond, and he is... but not like that. He'd never do something like that. It takes all sorts. You really have got the wrong end of the stick. It's not always easy to acknowledge things sometimes. It's not... It's very kind of you to be concerned, but you really have got the wrong end of the stick. OK. My daughter's been kidnapped. -What? -Tea. Can we just sit down? I wanted to tell the police... ..but Nevison won't. He wants to do exactly what they tell him, and they have said they'd let go of her... after the last lot of money he gave them, just this morning, but we've not heard anything, not yet. -What's happened? -Ann's been taken. She's been abducted. -How long's she been missing? -Four nights. -When did you last see her? -Tuesday morning. She was driving into Huddersfield. She set off... She has a little Mini, it's very distinctive. She had a dental appointment, only I know she didn't turn up because I rang up to see if she'd been. He's been giving them money? -Yes. -How? -How much? -No, how. I don't know. Do you think I should tell the police? You have told the police, Helen. I'm sorry, but I'm obliged to report something like this, I can't just... No. No. No. He spoke to a friend who was in the CID, and he said... Retired? Yeah. Well, he should've known better. No, look, Nevison really doesn't want the police involved. I think he's terrified they'd wade in and... Look, I don't know how to say this except bluntly, but most times when something like this happens, the outcome isn't... It's not good. You have a much, much, and I cannot tell you how much, better chance of getting her back safe, all in one piece, with the police on board. Nobody'll wade in, we have techniques, we have highly trained people, Helen. Are you going to let me make that phone call? Good Lord... Do you not think this is the right way forward, Helen? Yes. I don't know. I don't want him to think I've gone behind his back. I'll talk to him. If something did happen and you hadn't acted on your instincts, you'd never forgive yourself, would you? Yeah. Hello. It's Sergeant Cawood here, from Norland Road police station, Sowerby Bridge, Calderdale District. Can I speak to the on-call Detective Superintendant, please? He's in a meeting, is he? Can you knock on his door for me? I need to talk to him about a kidnap. It's a tiger kidnap, it's live, it's ongoing, it's happening now. Are you warm enough? Catherine? Phil. How are you? This is Helen. Helen, hello. I'm Phil Crabtree. I'm a detective inspector with the National Crime Agency. I just need you to stay calm and tell me everything you know. I know very little. I've been saying to Catherine, I'm not really the person you need to be talking to. The person you need to be talking to is going to be very cross when he finds out I've spoken to you. Mr. Gallagher? Look, I know you didn't want us involved, but I'm going to tell you the same thing Sergeant Cawood's told your wife, OK? We're four days in. Your daughter is likely to know a lot about the people that have taken her. They've got your money, and the reality is, they've got things to lose by releasing her alive... ..whatever they're telling you. Have you heard any more since this morning? -No. -OK. Well, then, we need to work quickly. All I need now is information from you -and we'll get the ball rolling. -I know very little. You'll be surprised. Does he always ring you on your mobile? Yeah. What comes up on the screen when he rings? Annie's number first time, then since then it's says -"number unknown". It's all on there. -Same man every time? -Yep. -When does he ring? Any time. -There's no pattern? -No. No. And Helen said the last phone call was this morning? This morning, yeah. Ten past eight. Saying where he wanted the money dropped. They tell me how much, then they'll ring back a few hours later, say where they want it. They rang yesterday afternoon, then again this morning. -They? -He. -Does he have an accent? -Round here. -How old does he sound? -I don't know. Not old. -What kind of language does he use? -He's cocky. He's clever. He thinks he's funny. "You can call me God", he says. He reckons like he's helping me. "I'll do what I can, Nev, but these people, they're nasty", like he's got nowt to do with 'em. -He calls you Nev. -Everyone calls me Nev. Do you think it's someone you know? -Someone you've met? -It could be, but it's not struck me. I don't recognise the voice. Somebody who knows ME, obviously. -How many times have you delivered the money? -Twice. -How do you do it? -They asked for my accountant to take it. He's called Kevin Weatherill. Why do you think they ask for him? He's little. They'll be thinking he's easily intimidated. So they know Kevin? I mean, they know of him. -They ask for him by name? -No. No, I think he said, "That little..." No, he said, "That irritating little twat of an accountant you've got." And so, where does Kevin go when he takes the money? McDonald's. Just off the Huddersfield ring road, first time, then Birch Services this morning, on the M62. So Kevin went this morning to Birch Services with... -how much money? -£50,000. Cash. Shit. What are you doing here? I've come to see you. Yeah, that's likely! Do you want to earn a few quid? Doing what? -Nothing. -All right. I just need to borrow your cellar. Just for a few days. -How much? -100. Two. Two quid? OK. You're cheap. -Still, we knew that. -200. -Whatever. -I should've said three. Yeah, but you didn't. -Nothing illegal. -Shut up. -Where have you been stopping? -Up your arse. You're so funny. This is a pile of shite. I'll be putting a padlock on here. Will you? It's a dog. It's been trained up for a fight. I said I'd look after it just for a few days. So when it's here, I'll keep it muzzled, but it might make a bit of noise, but don't go down there, all right? -It'll have your leg off. -What, with a muzzle on? I can't keep it muzzled all the time, can I? It'd be inhuman. I'll want the cash upfront. Make sure you stick it all up your nose, Mother. -Piss off. -And you. Aye, there were this woman here this morning. -What woman? -Catherine Cawood. She's a police sergeant down at Sowerby Bridge. She said she wants to talk to you. She said... next time you're passing you're to pop in the nick, she says. -Why? -She's Becky Cawood's mother. Did you know she had a kid before she died? Who did? -Who died? -Becky Cawood. -How? -I don't know. Anyway, kid's called Ryan. Lives with her, the policewoman. She's his granny. Is it yours? One of the smackheads down Hebden were saying it's yours. Anyway, she wants to see you. In the next hour or so, we'll send someone into your home and someone into your workplace. They'll be undercover, disguised as a telecoms worker, or something like that. We'll duplicate the phone. I've got the number. If they try and call you in the next half an hour or so, before we're up and running, whatever you do, stall them. If they ask you for more money, say you're happy to do that, you just need time to get it together. OK? And do I? Get money together? Yeah. If you can. Everything as normal. Don't give them any reason to think anything's happened. And don't tell anyone - anyone - what's going on. That does include Kevin. I know you trust him... I don't trust anyone, pal. But from our point of view, till we can eliminate him, we'll be treating him as a suspect. OK? One last one. Have you asked for any proof that she hasn't been hurt? He sent... Yesterday, he sent this. I'm sorry. Can I...? OK. Just go home, carry on as normal, and we'll be in touch. All right? Have you got a minute? I didn't plan this. She turned up at the mission. Only because she was worried about me and even then... I keep thinking about Kevin. Why Kevin? Why did they ask for Kevin to deliver the money? -How well do you know them? -I don't. She's a friend of my sister's. Why? She may have been alive when that picture was taken, but if they're saying they're not asking for any more money, and that was this morning... Kevin Weatherill came into my nick four days ago. He was agitated. He wanted to tell me something and then... before he could, he disappeared. We'll have obs on him within an hour. How long have you been back in uniform? Nearly nine years. I had a bit of a... My daughter died. God, I'm sorry. Then I had a grandson to look after, and being a detective didn't fit the lifestyle any more, so... It was nice to see you. -Thank you, Catherine. -No problem. -Do you need a lift? -No, you're fine, I'll ring our Clare. Ready to go. Hello. Hello. Fancy seeing you here. -She's not in. -Is she not? Well, that's all right. I was coming to see Ryan. I heard you wanted to play football with me. -In the dark? -Do you want to? I would. Only the thing is, I've never been very good at it. -It's easy. -I've got two left feet. -Have you? -Who do you support? -Man City. -That's bad. Edin Dzeko. It's all going right over my head, kid. Striker. Really? What else do you like doing? -Me bike. -He likes next-door's cat. -Do you? -I feed it when they go on holiday. -Very good. -He likes me best. So you say. -So... -Hello? -Edin...Dzeko? -Is everything all right? Where's he from? Not Manchester. -Bosnia. -Do you know where Bosnia is? -On a map? -Yeah. -Do you? -Hang on. I've to go pick our Catherine up in Sowerby Bridge. She's stuck there without a car. Are you... all right with him if I nip out? Well, I could... Yeah. Yeah, you go. He's all right here with me. One colleague described PC McAskill as fun-loving and outgoing, and another as someone for whom nothing was too much trouble, especially when it came to helping others. A family member talked about how, since the age of seven, she'd talked about wanting to be a police officer, and after securing a place at university in 2009 to study history, instead enrolled as a PCSO. The funeral is expected... ..to take place in two weeks' time. Can we turn this off? What's the matter? -What's happened? -I've thought... I've thought of a way out of the mess. How? I nearly, this morning, said something to Nevison, but... -Said something? -Yeah. Look. If I said, "I think I know who these people are," -and I persuade him to go to the police... -And to say Ashley? -To say Ashley's name? -Yeah. And to say that we rent the caravan up there, and I talk about work occasionally, and Nevison, the family, and that he must've picked up on that. On what I said. And then when Ashley says it was me, it was my idea, I just say that's a lie. Who are they going to believe? It's my word against his. You'd never keep your nerve. It was them! What? It was them that killed that policewoman. Those two yobs, those two animals that work for Ashley. They were moving her, Ann, in a van, and... -That's... -They got pulled over, yeah, by her, the police officer, the one that's dead... Only cos he had a rear light out... -My God. -And they killed her. They kill... They murdered a police officer, Jenny! That wasn't part of the plan. That was never part of the plan! And I'm not... If things... -I'm not being blamed for that. -Jesus! Which is why, I go to Nevison, I say, "I think I might know who these people are," and I persuade him we should go to the police. What about the money? The money that you've got? I just bury it somewhere. -I don't know. -Why?! Why don't you just go there and tell them the truth? -The truth? -Yeah. Just say that you did what you did but you had nothing to do with murdering this girl! -No, no, Jenny. No! -Why did you do it? Any of it? Why?! You know why, I've explained why. If he'd chosen to give me just a little bit more money -when I asked for it... -The girls, the girls, the girls! What use are you going to be to them in prison? Which is why, if I say this thing to Nevison and we go to the police and say, "I think I might know who these people are," it's a way out of it! Jenny! There'll probably be something you haven't thought of. Thanks. You'll never believe who I've left our Ryan with. Richard. Sauntered down to back yard, did he want to play football? Yep. OK. So, how's it going? It's being dealt with. Fair enough. I went to see Tommy Lee Royce's mother this morning. And she knows. She knows that that moron's Ryan's dad. -How? -Eyes on the road. How?! They want me to kill you... ..but I thought we could have a bit of recreational activity first. I have this thing on my mind. It's so weird. I have a son. I never knew. Eight years old. A boy, a lad. How about that? I just found out, just this morning. What do you think about that? This has just come in from the store for you. Boss, that cocaine I took off Marcus Gascoigne when I arrested him - it's unusable. As an exhibit. The packaging's been damaged, apparently. It wasn't damaged when I took it off him. -These things happen. -Yeah. All right. OK. So... this is the thing. The night Kirsten died, the district commander told me not to send it. He brought the subject up, not me. "You arrested Marcus Gascoigne, drop it." I said I couldn't - the stuff I took off him had gone straight into the store at Halifax nick. He said, "Take it out." I said I couldn't do that. And now... the results have come back saying that the packaging was damaged and it's unusable as evidence, and I know that it wasn't. -He told you to drop it? -Yeah. Well, then, I suggest that's what you do. -But... Things get damaged in transit. He told you to drop it. -So drop it. -That's... It's like you telling me you've entered an address by "ways and means", and me reckoning I haven't heard. Sometimes we turn a blind eye, don't we? Drop it. If his bloods come back tampered with, I am not dropping that. He was well over the limit. It wasn't tampered with. It was damaged. Do you think you're letting this get a bit personal? What did you have for your dinner? -I can't remember. -Think. -Oh, yeah, chips. -Chips? And custard. Nice! Nutritious... not. You wanted to see me. Put your seatbelt on. -Where are you living? -Is that my son? You're not at your release address, so where are you living? -I am living there. Is that my son? -No, not according to your mother, you're not. What were you doing at number 62 Milton Avenue? -What? -What were you doing there? -Not me. -You were seen. I saw you. Must be somebody who looks like me. What were you doing there? I wasn't in there. OK. Well, we'll see, when I get the and prints and swabs back from the lab. How come Becky's dead? I'm not talking to you about my daughter. -That's my lad. -He's got nothing to do with you. You know me and your Becky had a thing going on. You twisted little bastard. You raped her. -I didn't. -Yes, you did. -That's not... -I know what you did to her because she told me. You better not cross me, arsehole, because if you do, I'll chop your dick off and I'll make you swallow it. Is there anything I've said you'd like me to repeat more slowly? You're my son! Ryan! I'm your dad! You're my son! I knew your mum! -Who's that? -It's no-one. It's a scrote, nutter. He's off his head on drugs. These people say the first damned silly thing that comes into their heads. Did he believe you? I don't know. I don't know. He seemed to. Can he get access? I mean, if he proves... -If he can prove he's his dad... -God knows. -Probably. -Really? It won't happen. I won't let it. -But legally, he might... -I couldn't give a toss, legally. But if he's saying he didn't rape her, then it's his word against yours. It's not even his word against hers. She killed herself because of that bastard. That is... It's not proof. It's not like that's what he was convicted of! If he can prove that he is his, then he will have rights. He's not gonna prove it, because I'm not gonna let him anywhere near him. Are we being thick? -Who? -That cellar. In that house near the Chinese, all the stuff you found in there. Is that not like... how you might keep someone if you've kidnapped them and raped them. That's... I could flag it up. They could fast-track the prints and swabs I had taken. -They should pick him up. -No. God, no. If they think he's got anything to do with Ann Gallagher, that's last thing they'll do. They'll follow him. If they can find him. Cos he sure as hell -won't be anywhere he's supposed to be. -What... What... Do you not think we're onto something? Clare, the first thing you learn in this job is not to make assumptions. It's a short route to a cock-up. It can take your eye off what's really going on. Hiya, Phil. It's Catherine. Look, this might be something and nothing, but I just thought I'd flag it up. In West Yorkshire, detectives investigating the murder of PC Kirsten McAskill have said that as well as a white transit van, they're now also looking for a yellow Mini, and continue to appeal to members of the public for information. Martin Schofield reports from West Yorkshire. Four days on from the brutal of the brutal killing of... God. Hello? Phil? It's Nevison Gallagher. Have you heard this on the news about Kirsten McAskill? A yellow Mini! That's what our Ann was driving. -Shaf. -You all right, Sarge? What have I missed? Just three million phone calls from people whose neighbours have got a yellow mini. -How was the community meeting? -The usual suspects out in force. We've got a dead police officer, and they're still more bothered about the amount of dog shit up Smithy Clough Lane. Listen, I'm just going to look in on Tommy Lee Royce's mother again, -all right? I shan't be long. -OK. What for? Fun. Morning. Nevison. I... I think I might know who these people are. -Who did that? -What are you doing here? He's been here, because you gave him my message. I know that. So here's another one I'd like you to give him. Ryan is not his son. Ryan has got nothing to do with him. I would not waste my life dragging up something he'd spawned. -All right? -Right. You tell him... ..if he comes anywhere near our Ryan, there'll be bother. More bother than he knows how to handle. -All right? -Yeah. Did he do that? Why? -Why did he do it? -Cos it's Tuesday. Cos the sun's shining. Cos he feels like it. There is no why. -Do you want me to arrest him? -No. Lynn, if he's knocking you about, I'll arrest him. Yeah, then he'll do it even worse. I don't see him for f-f-f...weeks and then... I'll let his dog out, that'll fucking learn him. I don't see him for weeks, then he brings a dog, and I'm not allowed in me own cellar. Not that I ever go in there, like. You know, but... -What dog? -It's... Why's he got a dog in the cellar? -It's... -Show me, Lynn. -Show me. -He's just looking after it for someone. -I'm in trouble now. -Is Tommy here? No. -Why's it padlocked? -He put that on. He's training it up for a fight. Have you heard this dog? -It's muzzled. -Have you seen the dog? I don't think that's a dog in there, Lynn. Ann? Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! You're out of here. It's over. Get me out of here! Get me out of here! -What are you doing? -It wasn't me. What are you fucking doing?! You bitch! You're going to be eating food through a straw for the rest of your life. You're going to need someone to wipe your arse for you. Oh, yes. Do you like that, you slag? -Get in! -No, no, no... -Get in! -No! I need an ambulance. No! Get in, get in. Get in! Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that! Don't do that! Don't do that! Don't do that! No! Don't do that! Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd Sync: Marocas62
