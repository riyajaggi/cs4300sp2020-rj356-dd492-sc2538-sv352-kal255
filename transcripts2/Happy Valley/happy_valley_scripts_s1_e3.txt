 Some bastard's got our Annie and wants £1 million. We've got to ring the police. We're going to go to the police after we've got her back. Well, it's not mine. Hands behind your back. I'm not your mother. Nobody bullies you. You're a police officer. I did this stupid thing. You never finished telling me your story. It wasn't... really a police matter. Why have I just had police knocking on door?

 Just get her ready to shift her. Where are we taking her? I don't know yet. Just ring me as soon as you're on the move. Becky, my daughter... died just after Ryan was born. She was raped. Is that what you're going to do - mark his card for him? My intention is to deal with it effectively. You are kidding me?! 'I'm not.' You're lying. 'Nope.' That's disgusting! They don't call it animal husbandry for nothing. Why d'you think they wear wellies - farmers?

 Forget the mud. It's to slot the sheep's hind legs down 'and keep 'em rigid...' It is not! ..while you're giving 'em one up the bee-hind. Shut... up! Do you not know anything about the countryside? Do you honestly think they'd waste time legislating against it if it didn't really happen? I have to say, Mr Kershaw was unusually upset about being told one of his sheep had been knocked down at side of road. They always are! I'm telling you, it's a very special relationship these farmers have with their sheep. Draw your own conclusions. I suppose I'm attracted to Ollie and he's a bit of a beast. 'Well, there you go, you see. I rest my case.' If you didn't want to see the funny side, you shouldn't have joined the police force... service... force. Oooh! Gotta go. Jenson Button's just streaked past in a white tranny. 'I think he's trying to smash the land speed record, bless him.' And he's got a tail-light out. I think I might give him a tug. 'OK, well, you be careful and don't be long.' I wanna send everyone home in ten minutes. I wanna go home in ten minutes. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Bravo November 9512, can you PNC a vehicle for me, please? 'We're just changing shifts, 9512. 'Can you give us two minutes?' OK, thanks. Shit! Bravo November 9512? 'Nearly with you, 9512. Just give us a minute. He' gone to the toilet.' Forget it. Evening. Is this your van? Yeah. You were going at quite a lick there. Yeah. Sorry. I've... I've had bit of a long day, I just want to get home to girlfriend. Sure. What you done to your face? I had a fight... wi... with me brother. Can I see your docs? I've... not... I haven't got anything on me. Do you know where they are? They're in drawer at home. OK. What's your name? Lewis Whippey. You've got a light out at the back, Lewis. Did you know? No. Driver's side. Come and have a look. No, I'll... I'll take your word for it and I'll get it seen to. OK. I just want you to come and look at how dangerous it is, particularly on your off-side. D'you mind? You see? Yeah. You all right? Yeah, I think... I think I might be coming down with something like flu. All right, well, drive safe, OK? And get that seen to. Yeah? Soon. Otherwise you're going to cause an accident and you just don't need that sort of hassle, do you? No. Yeah. Thanks. Sorry. What you got in there? An elephant? No, it's just... my dog. What sort is it? Labrador. Nice. What's he called? Tommy. I'd like to see inside the van. It's locked. Where are the keys? It's just a dog. I'd like you to open the van, Lewis. Where are the keys? Er, he'll go mad. He'll run across moors and I'll never get him back! Are they in the ignition? OK, wait there. Do you know that person? No. Right, open it for me, please. I think they've killed me. 'Control to all units. 'Officer required to Scammonden Road, Ripponden.' Bravo November 45, responding. Go out for a drink, Sergeant Kirsten shows up... We've got a code zero, Scammonden Road, it's Kirsten. Bravo November 45. Have you called an ambulance? Shafiq, you come wi' me, Twiggy, take the other car. 'Ambulance is on its way, 45.' What's happened? Where are the keys? Right, well, go. You've...! Go. Get that van off this road fast. Like your arse is on fire. Y-You...! Nutter! She'd seen a white tranny with a light out, she was going to... Bravo November 45. Had she just PNC'd a white transit van? 'She'd put in a request but not given the registration.' Why would she do that? I want the helicopter up now, now, now, looking for a white transit van. Pass me the... What is there? Sarg? What's happening? Kirsten? We need to close the road. Bravo November 45 to Control, she's, er, she's dead. Looks like she's been knocked down. We need the on-call DI, we need CSI, we need the CIU, we need H-MIT. We need... We need the whole circus here. Shafiq, take the Landy down as far as Wheatcroft Lane and park broadside. Nobody comes through. Twiggy, same up at the top. Control, did you get me that helicopter? 'Helicopter's airborne and en route.' Move it, come on, close the road. We're preserving evidence now. I had to... give her a bit of a talking to yesterday morning. I said, "I'm not your mother. You're a police officer, nobody bullies you." She'd be out to prove something. She said, "This is all I wanted all my life and I'm shit at it," and I should've said, "No, you're not. You're fantastic, you're lovely," but I didn't, I just let her dwell on it, so she'd be thinking I'd be thinking that she was shit at it and I didn't. I don't think that. She wasn't. Catherine, go home. You've done all you can. Who's telling the next of kin, sir? Is it you? Yes, that's... I need your trousers and your boots as well. Do you want me to come with you? Who is the next of kin? Is there somebody we can ring to come and be with you, Ollie? Oh my God! Carolyn and Ian! Sorry, who? Er, it's Kirsten's mum and dad. Do you want to tell Carolyn and Ian or... ..is it something you'd like me to do? Can you do it? Where do the parents live? Er, five minutes away. Where's your car? At the nick. Right, well, we'll visit the parents then I'm dropping you off at the nick and then you're going home. You've got to let other people do their jobs now. I've got to write a duty statement. The SIO'll need it. And then you're going home. Oh, and... ..you arrested Marcus Gascoigne yesterday. Yeah. Do you think you might've made a mistake? No, sir. There was a packet of what appeared to be cocaine slipped under the front seat of his car. He refused to be breathalysed and he stank like a brewery. Yeah, what I meant was... he does a lot for us. On the council. How big was this packet? Tiny. Personal use. I'm sure he's had his fingers burned, so I'm just asking you to consider... the implications... ..before you take it any further. Well, it, it depends what comes back from the lab. Has it gone to the lab? No, it's gone into the store up at Halifax to have a field test. Take it out. I-I can't do that. Well... ..do something. You should try and get some sleep. What could a man, men, people - they, she said "they". "They've killed me." What could they be doing in a van, with a van, that was so bad that they had to kill a police officer? A kid. What had she stumbled across? It's going to be tough few days. It's going to be a tough few weeks. And I know from what Catherine's told me that no officer could be more well loved, more well respected, than Kirsten. And what I want to say is... ..we are here for you. Don't be too proud or too shy. My door is always open, Inspector Taylor's door's always open. Catherine's door's always open. If you want to talk to the doctor, you know where he is. If you want to talk to the chaplain, you know where he is. It might not sink in today, it might not sink in till the funeral Becky? It might be six months before it sinks in. But if at any time you feel you're not coping... Please don't keep it to yourself. I have no shadow of a doubt that our colleagues in H-MIT will move heaven and earth to find out who was responsible. Catherine. Sir. Er... OK. You heard him. We have to... get out there and do what we do best. Be patient with people. Everything that you deal with today is going to seem so trivial... ..but to everyone out there, if they've had to call the police, it's a big deal so, whatever's going on in your head, you treat people with the compassion and respect they deserve. At the same time, I want you with your stab-proof vests on, I want you with your batons, I want you with your CS gas because sometimes it's easy to forget that we put our lives on the line every time we go out there. So you look after yourselves. And keep in touch. For God's sake, keep in touch with me and with each other. Go on. Sarg? Do you want me to help out with that lad that's being sectioned this morning? Oh, yeah. Thanks. OK. Owen Brierley will crush both vehicles. One of you stays here with her, the other one takes the Mini, gets back here, then takes the van with her in it, dumps her somewhere, middle of nowhere, then takes the van to Owen. Finito. Dumps her in the middle of nowhere? Dead? No, not dead! You... chump! You've done enough damage. We're going to get hung, drawn and quartered, we're going to be thrown to the lions, we're going to be crucified. Upside down. In public! You... wanker! Two things. Three things. I have not come this far, I have not spent the last three days doing all the shit I've been doing to get so little out of it. That's one. Two - she knows too much. She heard him, shit-for-brains, talk about "ringing Ashley up at t'farm". And then last night he told the little police officer his name, his own name, and she, rich bitch, was two feet away from him in back of van, so... How d'you know? He told me. What was the third thing? Oh, yeah. We don't call me a wanker. She's staying here, you're ringing Nev. Telling him we want a hundred grand this time, right? And then... well, we'll see. They're onto us! You idiot. Why was she following you last night? The copper. Why did that other one turn up at the house? I don't think they are. She wasn't following him. She stopped him cos he had a light out. And that other one at the house? If they knew what we were up to, there'd have been 15 of 'em. They'd have kicked door down. OK. So who's staying here and who's taking the Mini? He can stay here. He's shitting bricks. He'll be useless out there. I'll tell him. Have you finished? I've finished. Right, well, can you both go and brush your teeth, please? All right! What's the matter? He made me take some of the money. Ashley. Yesterday. He split it up. He gave me £2,000 in a bag. And what could I do? I couldn't say "No thanks", he'd have been suspicious. I couldn't just... So what did you do with it? It's in the car. In the car?! Under the... In with the spare wheel. It's hidden. I... I don't know what to do with it. Destroy it. Burn it. No! It's money. Leave it somewhere. No. Don't bring it in the house. I'm not going to! Put it in a bin. Are your fingerprints on it? No. On the bag? I'm ready! That was quick. What's in those sandwiches? Tuna mayonnaise. How many times do I have to say the same thing? It's fine. It's not fine, it's disgusting! Don't go on at Dad. Have you brushed your teeth properly? Nobody listens. We need to be in the car. The road between Blackstone Edge and Mytholmroyd remains closed as crime scene investigators continue to analyse the isolated rural area where the incident took place just after five o'clock yesterday evening. We know that we're looking for a white transit van. Early indications from the scene suggest that a second vehicle was involved in the incident. From debris left in the road, we're confident that we will be able to identify the make and model and colour of that second vehicle. They now have the task of trying to... Helen? .establish exactly what happened... Awful. Are you all right? Where is she? She's somewhere. I've got my name on the roster today. At the mission. I think I'd like to go. And help out. Are you sure? Perhaps you should. Keep yourself busy. Someone should be here, in case. She could just walk through the door. Right, well, I'll ring in. Have you heard the news, Kevin? What... news? On the telly, this police woman. Oh, er, yeah. Yeah, terrible. She was only 23 and it was just up here. Just up above Ripponden on Scammonden Road. Yeah. Yeah. We wondered about having a whip-round for the family. Do you think that's appropriate to ask people for money or not? Nevison's not in this morning, otherwise I'd ask him. Isn't he? Why? I think, er, Helen. Why? Is she...? No, no, nothing new, just... OK. So what do you think? Hm? Oh, sure. Hi, it's me. I don't want... I can't destroy it. I want to give it back. To Nevison. Well, you can't. How? I know I can't. I know that. But... I can't destroy it. It's money. What about...? 'What?' If we split it up. Into smaller amounts. 'Just a few hundred each. 'And put some in your bank account, and some in mine.' And... I don't know... just... ..use it. To buy things with. 'Small things. 'Over a period of time.' You mean keep it? We'd just have to be careful that it didn't look like we suddenly had a lot of money to throw around. No, don't hurt him! Come on, son. Don't hurt him! Calm down, lad. You're making it a thousand times harder for yourself than it need be. Hey, you're witnesses! You've seen this! You're seeing what they're doing to me! Hey, it's nutty Khalid. Y'all right, nutty Khalid? If I'm never ever seen again, you'll know! You'll know that I've been abducted! I am being abducted, that's what this is! Stand up, Khalid. Get up. Yeah, really? By the government! Course you are! Yeah, government's got nowt better to do! No, because I know things! That's why they've been spying on me. That's why they've been watching me all day, every day! For months! And you think I don't know! Well, I bloody do! Is that why you wrap yerself up in tinfoil, you nutty bugger, eh? Does he? Yeah, man, with a pan on his head... to stop the radio waves penetratulating his brainium. Oi! # And another one And another one # And another bites the dust # And another one down And another one down # And another one bites the dust ♪ And another one bites... ♪ Get out of your vehicle. Why? Get out of your vehicle. What did you say? Nothing. No, I heard you. You said something. I'd like you to repeat it. I-I didn't mean anything. I was just singing. What were you singing? Nothing. So you think it's funny? Cos I got the distinct impression you thought it was funny. I don't know what you mean. So you think I'm stupid? No. Do I look stupid? No. Right, turn round. Why? Turn around. I haven't done anything. Yes, you have. You've used abusive words and behaviour likely to cause a harassment, alarm or distress, contrary to section 5 of the Public Order Act which is why you're under arrest. I was just singing! You're not obliged to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on court. No, no, no! Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Oh, no, no, you can't do that! No CCTV cameras in here, sunbeam. It's your word against mine. I'm sorry. I've said I'm sorry. Don't you ever... ever make fun of someone's death, you ignorant, rancid, infinitesimal speck of dirt. I'm sorry. Get out. Why? What you gonna do now? I just de-arrested you. I'll make a note of the fact that you apologised profusely. In tears. Mind how you go. What she say? Nothing. Eh? What she do to ya? Nothing! Done and dusted. Did you stay and watch him crush 'em? Yeah. Both of 'em? Yes. Have you rung Nev? I'm not saying I won't. I just.... I want to think it through. You do realise, either way, we can't just let her go... don't you? There's no point screaming. There's never anyone here during t'week. When can I go home? Soon. Maybe. S... Soon. I don't know. Help me! I can't. You're not like the other one. No. No... No, I'm not like that other one. Prove it. Help me. I'll say you helped me. I'll say you stopped him hurting me. You shouldn't have made that noise. Last night. None of it would've happened if you didn't... What happened? The bang? What? Y-You shouldn't've... What? I'll have five minutes while we're quiet if that's OK. Yeah, course you can, love. How are you feeling? Not so bad. I'm sorry, I just felt a bit... Hey. You don't need to apologise to me. It's not the cancer... It's more... just... ..not being able to cope... in the moment... sometimes. Have you heard any more about your treatment? Pills. To start with. A whole cocktail of them, three times a day. And then... ..one step at a time. You'll be rattling. You make me smile. You helped me find a way forward when I didn't think there was one. If there's the smallest, tiniest thing I can do... There was something. Your sister, Catherine... is she...? What? A discreet sort of person. Yeah, she's... I'd have said so. There's something I'd like to be able to ask a police officer about. OK. Do you think she might have a few minutes if I...? Could I come to your house? Sure. This evening. Yeah. She wouldn't mind? Oh... Just to warn you though, she's a bit upset at the minute. Cos of that girl who got killed last night up Scammonden Road. Catherine's her sergeant, and she's feeling it's all her fault, which it isn't... She won't want to be bothered with me. No. Honestly, Helen, Catherine'd do anything for anybody. I would not be a popular person in our house if I'd told somebody she was too busy to listen to 'em. Stop it. Stop it. No, you can piss off. 'Hello?' Nev! How are we today? I want my daughter. I'm doing my best with these people, Nev, believe you me. They're asking for another fifty grand. I want proof... ..that she's alive. You'd better not have been talking to the 5-0, Nev. The what? The rozzers. I haven't. OK. Well... as luck would have it, we do have a little photo of Annie somebody's took. I'm just sending it over just now. I'll be in touch as regards details tomorrow. And on the plus side, this could be the last drop. W-What d'you mean? I think they might have had enough of her. I think they might be thinking it's time to let her go. Nevison. 'They want another fifty grand tomorrow, 'and then he says...' ..they might start thinking about letting go of her. Um... ..will you... will you make the delivery again if... if that's the way they want it? I... Kevin? Why me? Well, I don't know! I'm just asking. I-I think he meant it - about letting her go. Catherine... Ollie's here. Come in. How are you? That's a stupid question. Would you like some tea? No. I'm, er... No, thanks. Want to sit down? Can I get you something else? Coffee? Water? Orange juice? I'll, er... Every room's full of flowers. Nowhere to put 'em, we've got so many. Shafiq's filled the Land Rover twice over and taken 'em to the residential home and... ..they just keep coming. She'd have given that thumbs up. Residential home. Yeah. I, er... I didn't want to say this... only it's been bugging me. She thought the world of you. You know that, don't you? Well, I thought a lot about her. Then Wednesday night, night before yesterday, she were crying her eyes out because of what you said to her. "I'm not your mother." I wasn't her mother. Yeah, well, well done. You know, it's probably cos of what you said she got killed... ..trying to prove how tough she was to some evil bastard. I'm sorry if you think I made a mistake. "If I think"? It's difficult sometimes and... ..being soft with someone... ..when they've not quite handled something isn't always what they need to bring 'em up to scratch. I couldn't have predicted what was gonna happen any more than anybody else could've done, and, you know, we don't know what did happen, so don't... But if you think for one second that I haven't thought about that myself, Ollie, you're wrong, because I have. I was thinking about it at four o'clock and five o'clock and six o'clock this morning. Right. Did you think about what I said? About Ryan? No, not about Ryan. About writing about all the drugs that go on round here, about how much damage it's doing. Oh, yeah, well... We had to help out this morning with this lad that'd been sectioned. Social Services were there to persuade him that he might like to go into a secure unit for three months, but guess what? He weren't too keen, so we had to wade in. He's been beating his mother up. He pulled a knife out on her yesterday. He thinks the government are sending her messages to her to poison him. It's nuts, yeah, except it isn't. It's cannabis-induced psychosis. That's what skunk does. Next time someone tells you cannabis is harmless... I will. I will. I will... I will look into it. And I arrested Marcus Gascoigne Wednesday morning for possession. He's a councillor. Class A drugs. Write about it. Did you want to talk about Ryan? I wanted to talk about us. Well, there is no us, you divorced me. I didn't divorce you. We got divorced. I'm sorry. Realise this isn't a great day for you. What about us? Eh? Oh, I don't know. Are you feeling bad? Yes. About what you've done to Ros? But you still want to see me. I never stopped wanting to see you. How... How could you... How could... I do... something? What? I know what your answer will be. Oh, well, you're way ahead of me. How could you let Ryan come between us? Then you say, "How could I let Ryan come between us?" So... There's no point going over it. It's old. What if... ..what if I said I would play football with him... ..and... ..make an effort with him. Really? You can't even say his name without looking like you've had your face slapped. Maybe if I got to know him it might be different. What about Ros? Oh, I don't think she'd mind him visiting occasion... No, no, I meant what about Ros as regards... Oh, shit! Sorry I'm late. I had a... I went, er... I met Richard for a drink in the pub. It's OK. She hasn't turned up. Richard, me grandad? Yeah. Yeah. Hasn't turned up? Did you ask him? I said seven. She said fine, she were gonna drive over, but, yeah, she's not turned up. Well, what was it to do with? I've no idea. And she's not rung to say? No. Did you ask him? Yes, I did, and he's... he's thinking about it. What is there to think about? Well, he's a busy bloke. Well, what was it about? I've no idea. I thought he'd lost his job. Not yet. But whatever it was, she were... you know, upset about it. I bet you haven't asked him! Well, did she not say? I have asked him. I hate you! I have asked him. You don't want me to play with him. You know, that's just... She said that... She asked if you were discreet. I don't know. Why didn't you ask? Cos she'd have told me if she wanted me to know. Look, ring her. What? Ring her. I can't ring her at home. Why not? You're friends. It's... She's Helen Gallagher. It's Nevison Gallagher's wife. It's fine at the Mission, we all muck in but... She's supposed to be here and she isn't. She was distressed about something and wanted to speak to a police officer. I wanna know that she's all right. Ring her. Hello, Clare. Hi, Helen. We were just wondering where you were. Oh, sorry, sorry, I should've rung. Er, I've decided, um... it's fine. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have troubled you. It's fine. You haven't. Is she all right? Are you all right? 'I'm fine. I'm fine. Really. I'm sorry.' Can I speak to her? Catherine says can she speak to you? If... Well, if she wants to. 'She's just here.' She says she's sorry, she just changed her mind, that's all. She's got cancer. Helen, it's Catherine. I'm sorry to hear you've not been well. Oh, that's... You wanted some advice. Er, yes, I did, but I... But...? Is someone stopping you from speaking to me? No. No, nothing like that. Has something bad happened? I just... It's... It's fine, honestly. Are you in danger right now? Are you in danger? 'No, no, no. Honestly. I'm with my husband. We're fine, it's fine. 'I think I...' I overreacted. I'm sorry if I've troubled you, I'm sorry if I've inconvenienced you. Well, I'm here. You know where we are. Me and Clare. You can call our house any time, day or night. I'm very sorry about your colleague. Oh... Thank you. Bye-bye, then. 'Bye-bye.' Is she all right, d'you think? I don't know. She said, "I'm with my husband," like... That's why she couldn't speak to me. You don't think... Nevison Gallagher, he... Oh, it takes all sorts. She always talks about him really affectionately. OK. Especially since she's been ill. Oh! You're just jealous cos I might like him better than I like you. Yeah, well, you might like to think that. I wish I lived there with them. Ryan. Don't speak to your granny like that, she's had a very difficult day. I don't care. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I've got "punchbag" tattooed across my forehead, but other than that. I think we're making a mistake. No. I should've just gone and not told you where I was going. I'm glad you told me, and I understand why you wanted to talk to her, but I'm convinced this is the right way forward. Helen... ..I think, after tomorrow, they are going to let her go. And the police, you know, they can be very good, but sometimes they just get it very badly wrong. I've done everything they've said. I'm not going to blow it now. Why don't you want the police around? That's... that's... that's just... This is our daughter. On the plus side, of all... Kirsten. At least it's taken your mind off Tommy Lee Royce. Right, he's rung. He does want you and this time he wants it left in the toilets. Birch Services. M62, westbound services, the men's toilets. The last cubicle on the right-hand side as you go in. Stuff it behind the toilet. All right? Then leave, quickly. Don't turn around and look back. All right? I'm grateful, Kevin. It's fine. It can't be safe. Can it? Leaving it in a toilet for any length of time. They must be there. They must be there watching, otherwise any bugger could find it. I-I don't know. Well, we'll play it by the book... this time. Keep your eyes peeled. Come straight back. Ring me the minute you drop it. OK. Look who's here. Fifty thousand. I should get going. Not so soon. You're meant to be on the M62. D'you want some tea? No... thank you. He, er, Nevison, said... ..he got the idea from you that you might let her go... ..now, after... I'd just like to say... I think perhaps you should. I don't think we need to do this any more, I mean, not from my... Right, that's yours. Five grand. Take it. So, er... ..so as regards... ..Ann. I'll be in touch. Is she all right? She's absolutely fine. Is she? Yes. OK. We just... What? Well, I told you. Police, policewoman, knocking on the door, at the house where we were keeping her. Well, it was nothing, but... if she knew we were holding her there, she'd have had the door down. But we still don't know what she was doing there, so... What did she look like, the policewoman? I don't know. I didn't see her. It was Tommy. Why? No reason. Anyway, we've moved her - Ann - but... Yeah. I think it might be time to bring the thing to a close... ..one way or another. I'd better, er... Take your time. You don't want him thinking things. Stupid wanker. Do you want to say that a bit louder? It's all your fault! You genius, who never gets his hands mucky. Do I know what you're talking about? Don't you? Policewoman on Scammonden Road. How... how is that...? Has he not told you? We had to move her - Ann - only, little policewoman decides to pull us over, doesn't she? Cos there's a light out on the van. So that mad bastard, he... Your fault. You know that day I came home and said, "Tommy Lee Royce is out of prison"? Do you remember? Yeah. And you said, "I know." And I said, "Why didn't you tell me?" And you said, "I didn't want to upset you." Yeah. Yeah, well, how did you know? He was here. He came in here once or twice after he got released. They often come in here, ex-cons, till they've sorted themselves out. Are you cross? Because if you are, you needn't be. You know what you get like. I didn't say anything because I care about you. 'Are you speaking to me?' Yeah. 'So... did you find anything out?' There's no-one there. I broke in, and, yeah, I found something - I don't know what exactly. Knocked on a few doors either side, but nobody seems to know anything. I think he's had someone in there, I think he's hurt someone in there. 'How? 'Why?' Cos I found things in the cellar. 'Well... can't you investigate it properly if...?' Yeah! How? 'No crime's been reported, and I've just broken into a house.' The fact that I'm a police officer doesn't make it legal. I might go knocking on his mother's door. 'She won't know owt, but... '..might find out who owns this house.' I still don't know what it is you think you're going to do to him. Nothing, Clare. I'm not going to do anything to him. I just want to make sure that he's not going to do anything to anybody else. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
