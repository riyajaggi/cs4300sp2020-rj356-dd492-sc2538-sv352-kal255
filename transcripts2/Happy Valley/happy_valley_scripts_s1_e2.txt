 Happy Valley (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 Learning that Nevison's wife Helen is terminally ill Kevin feels increasingly guilty and tells his own wife Jenny what has happened. She advises him to deny all contact with the others and refuse to accept any money so that when, on Nevison's instructions, he takes the ransom to Cowgill, he hides his own share. Lewis is concerned that Royce is ill-treating Ann and plans to kill her when the full ransom is received but is savagely beaten by Royce when he tries to intervene on her behalf. Catherine meanwhile starts a poster campaign to locate Royce and, after arresting local councillor Marcus Gascoigne for drunk driving and arguing with Richard for refusing to accept Ryan as his grandson, she gets a call leading her to the house where Ann is being held. Royce hides when she rings the bell but becomes paranoid as to how she knew where to look for him.

 I'm Catherine, by the way. I'm 47, I'm divorced, I live with my sister who's a recovering heroin addict. I have two grown-up children. One dead, one who doesn't speak to me, and a grandson. How would you like to make half a million pounds? You're talking about kidnapping her? Some bastard's got our Annie. And he wants a million quid. Are you here to report a crime? KEVIN: Nevison could afford to lose half a million pounds easily. Any more and he might go to the police. CATHERINE: Oh, Becky, me daughter.

 Died just after Ryan was born. She was raped. I'm terrified if Ryan's like him in any way shape or form. Which he's bound to be, isn't he? CLARE: Tommy Lee Royce is out of prison. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to upset you. You look after yourself, love. I will be in touch. OK, thanks a lot, bye-bye. Bravo November 45. Operation Greensleeves. Sighted, the ice-cream van outside Wilberforce House in Sowerby Bridge. I'm going after it, I'm on foot. Registration Hotel Kilo 11 Romeo November X-ray. I'm going after it, I'm nearly with it, I'm going to stop it. 5-0. Come on.

 Dad, 5-0. '45, do not chase the vehicle on foot.' Yeah, whatever. Oi! Pull over! Oi! Oi! Failed to stop. Off-side window smashed. Two occupants. Both white, male, one with a sleeve tattoo, dark hair, beard, pale blue T-shirt, khaki body-warmer, the other ginger hair, beard, pasty-faced, pink hoodie. Driving off towards Wharf Street. You're getting too bloody old for this, Catherine, love. ♪ There's a tower block overhead ♪ All you've got's your benefits ♪ And you're barely scraping by ♪ In this trouble town ♪ Troubles are found ♪ Stuck in speed-bump city ♪ Where the only thing that's pretty ♪ Is the thought of getting out. ♪ We're going to have to take it out of the business. We're going to have to borrow a bit from here, there and everywhere, that's how we can do it. You're not to tell anyone, they get a whiff anyone else knows, they say they're going to start doing stuff... to her. I won't. I won't. And they must be watching me, they know things. These people are often very... very highly organised. For months! Following me. Following Ann! Jesus! We can... I can look into how much you can take out of the business if that's... I've got maybe 200 grand I can lay my hands on immediately, but even then, are they going to let me withdraw that amount in cash, without asking bloody questions? Well, it's your money. Yeah, but they're going to think I'm laundering money, then they're going to tell the police! Really? Well, I would! Why would anyone be withdrawing that amount in cash if it wasn't dodgy? I... We'll get it, we'll get it, I'll raise it. I'll ring what's-his-name. At the bank. I'll say, I'll just say, "I want to withdraw 200 grand in cash," see what he says. Sure. "How soon can you have it?" Sure. Yeah, see if it can be done without anybody sticking their bloody... noses in. Sure. Pay the money, get her back, safe and sound, and then find out who the little... ..are and choke 'em with it! Absolutely. Absolutely. Get me Adam Stapleton on the phone and tell him it's important, please. CLARE: Outside the Chinese up Rawson Lane? CATHERINE: Yeah. How d'you know it was him? Er...because I'm not blind? 'No, come on... 'He's been in prison for God knows how long.' It was him. 'Fine, OK. Fine, fine. 'Even if it was...' Yes? "Even if it was..."? What time's your dinner break? You pushed it as far as you could after Becky died. You did everything you could, Catherine. Everybody knows what he is, the fact that the CPS couldn't run with it is bad, it's awful, everyone knows that, but... What? I worry about you. Getting yourself all upset and obsessed with it all over again. That subhuman piece of rotting excrement should be on the Sex Offenders' Register. And he isn't. I think that's something worth getting obsessed and upset about. Don't you? You're never going to be able to approach this objectively. you're going to make yourself ill again. He's on my patch. You think I'm going to ignore it? Sooner or later, unless somebody marks his card for him, big style, he's going to hurt someone else. Is that what you're going to do? Mark his card for him? It's my job. How? How're you going to do it? The less you know, Clare. You see, that - saying something like that - just makes me even more worried that you're not... What? Not going to deal with it rationally. Rationally? I've no intentions of dealing with it rationally. I'm amazed you'd think anybody'd expect me to. You're winding me up. My intention is to deal with it effectively. All right, well, you've heard what I'm saying. I worry about you, OK? You worry about me... staying on the wagon. I worry about you. You're the only sister I've got. JOYCE: Catherine! Joyce! Mrs Godley, Turnpike Street, Elland, just rung the desk line to say, "Them lads in that ice-cream van, they are at it again." Right now? Right now. Job on, boys and girls! I need everybody. The ice-cream man cometh! Let's go, go, go and get him. And you make sure you're tooled up properly this time, lady. 45 to 9242. SHAFIQ: '9242, go ahead.' What's your location, Shaf? it's all hands on deck. 'We're just on by wharf.' Bravo November 45 to Control. Go ahead, 45. Have we a mobile unit, double crewed? I need 'em for a back-up job on Turnpike Street in Elland. Silent approach, rendezvous on Cemetery Road. There you go, enjoy. Can I have two of them what he had? Here y'are. 5-0. What? Oi! Get off! Stay where you are! Right. Hold him down. Calm down! Stop moving. Stop wriggling, you're not going anywhere. What's in your pockets? Nothing. Eh? Nothing! What's your name? Nothing! Right. Well, I'm arresting you, OK? On suspicion of supplying drugs, d'you understand? You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you... Stop wriggling! ..if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. HE GROANS Those are well expensive ice creams you're flogging, Alfie. TV: 'Selling your own home and saving thousands of pounds in the bargain. 'Single mum, Millie Spencer, wants to move to a smaller house...' How's things? Good. She been all right? In what sense? Well, keeping quiet, behaving 'erself. Yeah. Right, well, you can clear off for a few hours. I'll see to things here. OK. TV CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND Have you fed her? Er...no. What happens if she needs a wee? There's a bucket. Have you not tied her to chair? Oh, yeah. So...? Tell you what. I'll go down and check, shall I? Leave her. Eh? Leave her. Leave her! She's fine. Like I said, you can go. I'm OK here. Ashley's got stuff he needs doing. He doesn't need two of us here, we do shifts. You think you're the bastard who gets to watch telly all day? MUFFLED WHIMPERING Is he...? Not in? No, he's popped home. Why... Probably catch him on his mobile. If it's important. Yeah, sure. Sure. I didn't want to tell you until it was over and done with. But...I can't think straight, I don't know what to do. We've got to ring the police. They're watching us. They'd know. And then God knows what they'd... How? They...might even have the phones bugged. We just... We just don't know, do we? But they are organised, Helen. Didn't we used to know someone in the CID? Neil Mitchell. They're not going to get away with this, Helen. Please give him a ring. We're going to go to the police after...after we've got her back. They're not going to get away with it. MUFFLED WHIMPERING There's no need to be frightened. All right? Bitch. If everything goes down like it should, you're not going to get hurt. OK? SHE CONTINUES SOBBING You need to stop crying, bitch, otherwise you're just going to annoy me, and there's no need. Do you want anything to eat? ANN WHIMPERS Do you want to... Do you need to use the bucket? I won't look. Right, well, um... I'll be back in a bit. And you see if - when - I can trust you, I'll be able to unfasten you. So you can... And everything, so... Are them...? ANN WHIMPERS OK, well, d'you want to keep it behind the counter? Tell everybody who works here and if he does come in, if you recognise him, if you see him looking at your menu out there, if you see him walk past, anything, can you... ..give us a ring? Don't challenge him, don't approach him, don't say anything. Just act normally, serve him, whatever, and then ring me. PHONE RINGS Hello? 'Are we allowed to fuck her?' Ashley? 'Why would you be asking me that, Lewis?' Look, I'm just asking. You're a sick little bastard, aren't you? 'No, no,' it isn't me. It's... Is he there? 'Weirdo. I sent him over.' Yeah. 'I think he's had her...in cellar.' Why, what...? What makes you think that, Lewis? 'Well, he's had her knickers off, anyway. 'So I were just... I were just asking, really. 'That weren't...that isn't... 'That wasn't part of the plan. Is it? 'Ashley?' Well, Lewis, I don't want you to feel that it's obligatory. You mean you told him to do that? No. No, I didn't. Sounds to me like he were just using his initiative. Right, well, I'm not... I don't want to...that's... I'm not doing that. 'I'm not asking you to, Lewis.' Good. Cos if this goes tits up, I'm not the noncy weirdo bastard that's getting done for rape. LINE GOES DEAD Granny's been in a fight. Oh, God. Is it bad? She was chasing this scrote, and he kicked her in the face. Did he get away? Hell, no! What'd he been doing? Selling ice creams. Oh. OK. Are you going to get changed? Yep. Are you OK? Yeah, couple of Nurofen, I'll be like new. Have you not taken something before? I've not had time. Daniel rang. He's invited us over for tea tomorrow. All of us? Well... I said I'll see if Ryan can go to one of his friends', and he didn't say, "No, it's fine, bring him with you." So... I'm...yeah, assuming it's just you and me. So... ..he rang you, his auntie. He didn't ring me, his mother. Well, he rang on the house line. When he knows I'm at work. You work shifts, Catherine. You could've been here. Why tea tomorrow? I don't know. Maybe him and Lucy have got some news. He's invited Richard and Ros as well. Oh. What news? Is Lucy pregnant? You know as much I do. Oh, well, that'd be... You mean you didn't ask? No. I'm not a copper. He'd have told me over the phone if he'd wanted me to know. They probably want to make an announcement. So you think that is what it is. I don't know! Have you got any fags? Couldn't believe how much gear they were carrying. And a bit of everything - coke, heroin, M-Cat, cannabis, crystal, E's. He'd got over 3,000 quid in his pockets. There's no wonder he didn't want copping. D'you know what...really... ..annoys me. I rang ahead, I flagged it up to the drugs squad, I said d'you want to talk to these lads first? Yes, they did. I said I wanted Twiggy and Shafiq sitting in on the interviews once they got 'em to Halifax. Fine, no problem. Course, it's all "no comment, no comment, no comment." So that's it for us at our level. We never get any closer. We never get any higher up the food chain. Any intelligence they have - drugs squad - about where all this stuff's coming from, how it's getting here, I never get to hear about it. I just get to mop up the mess at the bottom end. And we should know. I should know. If they know stuff about people on my patch, people bringing stuff into this valley, I should damn well know about it. Well, why wouldn't they let you know? Oh, they'll have some covert surveillance stuff going on that numpties like me aren't allowed to know about. In case you tell your sister? Till they need a bit of back-up. Exactly. And she leaks it to her contacts in the media. Which you would. Inevitably. It's either that or they don't actually know any more than I do. Which is even more worrying. At least it's taken your mind off that other business. I printed a photo of the little... shit off the box and I went in to Chinese. Say that again slower. Mickey Yip runs it. D'you remember Mickey Yip? He used to be in the year between us at school. Well, you know my opinion. Ooh! What? I forgot. PHONE RINGS Hello. 'Hello, it's me.' I know. Do you know a Kevin Weatherill? He lives next-door-but-three to you and Ros, drives a BMW. 'Kevin? Yeah.' What's he like? 'Oh, very nice. Ordinary. Quiet. Two girls.' She's in the early stages of multiple sclerosis, Jenny, his wife. Walks with a stick... sometimes a wheelchair. But, yeah, no... He's an accountant. He works for Nevison Gallagher. OK. 'Why?' Is there any... problems that you know of? Not that I'm aware of. Why? 'No reason.' Is that...? Oh, yeah, thanks. Is Lucy pregnant? Ha-ha! I wondered that. Hi. Hi. Did you have a nice day? Yeah. GIRL: Did you see that? GIRLS CHATTER AND LAUGH The weirdest thing. What? It's, er...you can't mention it, not to anyone. OK. Nevison's...like I've never seen him, all over the place. And... God. What? Someone's taken Ann. Taken? Abducted. Kidnapped. They rang him, on her phone, this morning, mid-morning, saying they wanted a million pounds in cash. Has he been to the police? No! God, no! These people... The thing is, the thing I didn't know... Helen's ill. Really ill. I mean...liver cancer. She's dying, she's... Oh, my God! When did...? He should go to the police! No. That's... He should because they'll know how to deal with it. Well, that's easy to say! But can you imagine? If it was one of these two? These people don't mess about, Jenny! If he steps out of line, they're threatening to... do things to her and... Jesus. That's... Well, it's... Oh, um, Ashley rang, you know, from the farm. Ashley? Yeah, just something to do with the rental on the site. He said can you ring him when you got in. 'Hello?' Have you changed your mind about me ringing you, then? 'How's Nev?' How would you expect him to be? 'Hey, calm down, pal.' It's your party. Is he getting this cash together, then, or what? 'What is all this shit' about a million. I specifically said don't ask for any more than 500,000. It were you, insisting you had to have a hundred grand. I told you, I've got overheads. I've got expenses. 'Say you'll accept less next time you ring him.' Sure. I mean it. 'OK.' I'm serious. You're the boss. So what did you want? I wanted to know he was getting on with it and that he hadn't been anywhere near the police. 'No, he won't, he wants her back all in one piece.' Good. Well, he needs to buckle down and get on with it, then. You're not going to hurt her. 'I'm not, no. But I can't vouch for my lads. 'Cooped up with her all day. 'Eh? Getting little ideas in their little heads.' What are you talking about? Tommy's just got out of prison. Poor lad hasn't had his leg over in eight years. 'Use your imagination.' You'll tell them not to touch her! You'll get the money, just tell him you'll take less! 'Right.' I mean it! 'Yeah, you said.' LINE GOES DEAD I did this stupid thing. Tommy! Son. I want you to do something for me. You've got to go to the police. I know. Except... ..I can't. Do you know where they're keeping her? No! No. I know nothing. I... They... I don't think they're even going to give me any money at the end of it. I think I've just been...shafted, and used, and taken for a ride and I don't even know why I did it! Just... I was so angry at Nevison. Then he turns around and tells me Helen's got cancer and he offers me more money! Jesus. Do you think they'll hurt her? No. No. He's doing it for the money. He's not doing it to hurt her. So... So we... ..know that she's safe. Ish. I mean, even if she doesn't, and even if her parents don't, we know that Ashley wouldn't... Yeah...do anything... Yeah. Yeah, we know that. Yeah. So is there anything... Was this all verbal? Between you and Ashley. There's no emails, no... I phoned him this morning, and just now. Phone calls are traceable. But not the content, not what you say. No. No. I don't know, I don't think so. So... you could just deny everything. You deny putting the idea in his head. You say that none of those conversations ever happened. That it was all him. I mean, if it becomes necessary. If they get caught. Which they will. Which is why you mustn't go anywhere near that money. Even if it looks like they've got away with it. Cos they won't. In the end. People like that never do. Night-night, love. Night-night. Is Granny going to come in and kiss me? I'll ask her. Y'all right? Too old to be getting knocked about by scrotes. You love it. You know you do. Mmm. Promise me you'll not let that bastard get to you. I won't let that bastard get to me. Ryan says will you go up and give him a kiss? Yup. DOOR OPENS GAME PAUSES DOOR CLOSES GAME STARTS You can go now. SIRENS WAIL FOOTSTEPS RECEDE GAME STOPS What? We can't leave her in that cellar all night. She'll freeze. She'll be reet. I gave her her knickers back. I think it might be best we leave it that way from now on. Have you heard? You can go home now. I'm putting her in that bedroom. She can sleep in that sleeping bag. Leave her. I ain't taking orders from a screwhead like you. Ashley wants me to take a photo of her. In the cellar. Not looking like she's having a right lot in the way of fun. OK? I can do that. Yeah, but he asked me. So... Right. Well, do it, then. Then I'm putting her in that bedroom and I'm giving her that sleeping bag. I'll do it when I'm ready. You're not hurting her. That was never the plan. Do you know something, Lewis? I don't think you're cut out for this. First off you blab, in front of her. "Ashley up at farm." And now you want to put her upstairs, where people are more likely to see her. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? You're the one that... Why don't you just get yourself a girlfriend, like normal people? What's up, Lewis? Are you jealous? Jealous?! You... You're just... You're not even... And you think I have no idea? Do you think when she gets out of this she's going to let you get away with whatever it is you think you've been doing to her? Do you think her dad is? Maybe she won't get out of it. Now what are you bloody saying? I think once the cash's been handed over, the safest thing would be to... HE MIMICS CHOKING That isn't... That was never... It's your fault. Blabbing. She never heard that! She might've done. You don't know. She didn't. Take the photo, take the stupid photo and go. I'll look after her. No, you'll put her in the bedroom. I'm not leaving her on her own with you, you weirdo! I won't put her in a bedroom. I might give her the sleeping bag, but I won't put her in a bedroom. Ashley wants you. I'm not leaving you on your own with her. I don't care what Ashley wants. Right. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ANN WHIMPERS We need a picture now, for your daddy. We're going to send it to your daddy so he can see how much fun you're having with us. So...smile! PHONE CLICKS One more for luck. Yeah? One more with my hand up your fanny. Leave her alone! ANN WHIMPERS BOTH BREATHE HEAVILY Anything else to say? Little shitty pants. HE SPITS COUGHING GASPS FOR BREATH ANN WHIMPERS SIREN WAILS MUFFLED CONVERSATION Marcus. Catherine. Ooh, been in the wars? What happened? Went straight into the back of her. Couldn't stop in time. She must have slammed her brakes on, everyone's piled in behind. My constable radio'd me to say she'd asked you to take a breathalyser test and you weren't right keen. Is there a reason for that? Ah, come on. It's quarter past eight in the morning, I'm not going to stand here looking like I've had vodka for breakfast. People know who I am. She wasn't doing it to make you look bad - it's routine when there's been a smash. SHE SNIFFS She'd have asked you even if she hadn't smelled alcohol on your breath. OK, look. I had a late night. Last night. I, er... I wasn't at home. So I haven't had time to shower, get changed. So admittedly it may be on my breath, but I'm certainly not over the limit. So you thought calling her a stupid little effing something-beginning-with-C would help? She threatened to arrest me. She was doing her job. She risks her neck every day, all of my officers do, dealing with scum and tossers. What none of 'em need is abuse from someone on the council who above all people should know better. Yes, yes. I know and I'm sorry. Obviously, it had... It had just happened, I was upset, I was shaken. I'd like you to blow into the tube. If you refuse again, I'll arrest you. OK. Look. I'm more than happy to apologise to her. Really, I am. Good. Well, you can do that as soon as you've done this. Catherine, come on. You know I've got the highest respect for you and your team. I'm amazed you're making a fuss like this. Can you blow into the tube, please? It wasn't me who caused the accident! It was the woman at the front. She's been breathalysed. She didn't have a problem with it. And the cause remains to be established. I'm not standing here and being humiliated and compromised like this. OK. Then I'm going to have to ask you to give me the keys to your vehicle. Oh! You'll understand that I can't let you drive away from the scene if you're refusing to be breathalysed. I have to say, I never had you down as a jobsworth. HE SNIFFS Keys are in the ignition. And I'm only refusing on principle. I want you to understand that and I want it noted down. You're refusing because you've been drinking. You and me both know that. I have to say, Catherine, I'm very disappointed in this attitude you're taking. Can you explain to me what this is? I've no idea. Well, it looks like a little packet of white powder to me. Well, it's not mine. Well, it's in your vehicle. Jesus! Y... You've just put that there. You've just planted that there. I'm arresting you on suspicion of drunk driving and possessing an illegal substance. It's not mine! It's got nowt to do with me! You don't have to say anything, but it may... Can you turn round? Hands on the roof of your vehicle. Don't do this. SHE READS HIM HIS RIGHTS This is going to have consequences, and not for me. Catherine, it's ridiculous! It's humiliating! You're making a big mistake. Have you got any other substances on you? No, don't be ridiculous! Look, it's a plant. It was planted. All right, maybe not by you, but it was planted. You're going to regret this, you're going to regret it a lot, and soon, and for the rest of your life, you understand? You're going to lose your job over this, and worse. Much worse. OK, hands behind your back. I'm not your mother. You've gotta remember that nobody is above the law. However important they try and tell you that they are, however much they try and bully you into thinking that you've got the wrong end of stick, nobody bullies you - you're a police officer. This is all I've ever wanted to do... all my life... ..and I'm shit at it. Go on, off you go. DOOR CLOSES RATTLING DOOR CLOSES FOOTSTEPS DOOR OPENS KEYS JANGLE You can go. PHONE RINGS Hello? ASHLEY: 'Y'all right, Nev?' Where is she? She's fine. She's lovely. She's spent a very comfortable night. 'Let's keep it that way, eh?' Is she? Has she? 'So, tomorrow.' McDonald's drive-thru just off Huddersfield ring road. 'I want to speak to her.' Let's see how we get on tomorrow first, Nev, eh? Then we'll see about letting you speak to her. We'd like an initial instalment. By way of showing willing. 20 grand. 'Cash, obviously. 'And I don't want you dropping it.' I want that irritating little twat of an accountant you've got. Me? Yes. Me? Yes. No. I... All you have to do is drop it in a bin. Marcus Gascoigne? It's priceless, innit? Marcus Ga...! Didn't you...have him once? No... No! God, no. Well, just that once. You know...the scrotes, the dropouts, the numpties with nothing going on in their lives, you can... not condone it, but you can more easily see it, get it, understand it, almost. But someone like him, apart from the hypocrisy... Yeah, well, it takes all sorts, doesn't it? No, I didn't mean you. I wasn't thinking about you. You just... got in with the wrong crowd, didn't you? Well, it sounds like he's blown it as regards being a councillor when all this comes out. You're joking! He'll get some smartarse lawyer to tidy it all up for him, to spin it, to twist it, the Teflon twat. Nothing'll stick. You watch. Did you have to hand him over to drug squad? Oh, yeah. First dabs, every time. I just tidy the streets, me. Hiya! Catherine, what have you done to your face? Oh, it's work. How are you? Really well. Ooh, looks sore. Hiya, Clare. Hiya, love. Er, his friend he were going to, he's got a sore throat, so we... got blown out at the last minute. I brung you some chocolate. BOTH: Brought. Come on in. Mum! Hi. Hello. Hiya, Ros. Oh, good Lord, what have you done to your eye? Oh, it's work. How are you? Good. Good. Er, I've brought Ryan. He was going to a friend's, only they cried off at the last minute, cos he's got a bug, his friend has, so... Ryan brought me some chocolates. The thing is, this house, it's the sort that just doesn't come on the market very often. So, if we didn't go for it now, we might not get the chance again. Which would be fine, if I wasn't being made redundant. When did you find this out? Last week. The thing is, they're going to still need journalists. It's going online, which is fair enough, but they still need stories. We have to reapply. They need exactly half the number of us, so... You're assuming that you won't be one of the ones they want back, which is... That's not entirely the point, is it? The point is, half of us might be taken back on, half of us won't. I wouldn't want to be in either position. I'd rather walk away having made my feelings about the damned thing plain. Well, that's just cutting off your nose to spite your face. Well, you may choose to see it that way, but the point is, either way, it's certainly not a good time to be getting a bigger mortgage. On a... HE CLEARS HIS THROAT ..on a lighter note... Sorry, Dad. Um... The reason we've got you all round is cos we've got some kind of more happy news for you. Um.... Lucy... Well, we're, um... She-she's pregnant. We're having a baby. Oh, my God! Catherine! No, that's... That's...wonderful. That is wonderful. That is really... You're crying. I'm happy! Aw! And how...how...? How many weeks? 12. We thought we'd wait till, you know... Ohh! And...and are you...? I'm fine. I felt a bit sick once or twice. Think that's how I knew. Um... Then I went off coffee and red wine, which made me think, "Ooh, hello!" Congratulations. Oh, no! You're going to be grandparents! Well, we're already grandparents. What are you doing about work? Have you decided? Well, obviously, I don't want to give my job up, so... "Ho Ho for the robbers The cops and the robbers Ho Ho! "And the toys? Oh, they were taken back "By a Santa Claus copper with a Santa Claus sack "While the rest of the force searched day and night "For an elderly lady of medium height "With a fondness for earrings and red fox furs "And a habit of taking what wasn't hers "She usually carried a sizeable bag "Her name, of course, was Grandma Swagg "Ho Ho for the robbers The cops and the robbers Ho Ho!" Granny. Yes, chick? Is that Richard my grandad? He...he used to be my husband. So, yeah. He... Technically. And he was your mum's dad, so, yeah. Yes, he is your grandad. Can I go and see him? Would you like to? Where does he live? On towards Ripponden. Can you drive me over? Like, one Saturday morning. Then he could play football with me. Well, we'll have... we'll have to see. PHONE RINGS Hello? 'Kevin, it's Ashley. 'You do realise you don't really have to drive 'to McDonald's off Huddersfield ring road, don't you?' She's all right. Ann. Isn't she? She's fine. She's absolutely fine. There you go. That's yours. KNOCK ON DOOR Hello. Is he in? Yeah! Come in. I was just passing, I was, er... He's just getting changed, I'll give him a shout. Richard! Can I make you a cup of tea? No. Thank you. I meant to say...about yesterday. I'm sorry that I put my foot in it. It's fine. I said it without even thinking. It's fine. Hi. Hi. Have you got five minutes? Sure. It's delicate. Can I...? Yeah, course. D'you want me to leave you on your own? No, no, no, er... OK, erm... So yesterday, after yesterday, last night... ...Ryan asked me if you're his grandad and, erm, I... I couldn't... I said you used to be my husband and you were his mum's dad and I said... I said yeah, yeah, you are his grandad. But the thing... No, I'm sorry. I am sorry. I know I made this decision, and I know you didn't, and I've brought it all on myself, and I've got no right to ask you this, but I'm going to. He... He asked me... ..if I would drive him over here one day, one Saturday... ..so you that you could play football with him. Cos it doesn't occur to him that...that you being his grandad wouldn't want to do that, wouldn't want to play with him. I'm not his grandad. You shouldn't have told him that. OK. Fair enough. Except, you know, you are. Don't. You know, I don't...I don't get the way you can think... I'm not going through all this. If I'd decided to wash my hands of him, he'd have ended up in care. You made that decision. Our daughter's child would've ended up in care. She never wanted him! It's still her flesh and blood! She was raped! Our flesh and... She killed herself because of him! She killed herself because she'd been raped not because of him! It's the same thing! It isn't! It isn't. He was there to remind her every day. That's why she... That is not his fault! I can't look at him. I realise it was a big ask. Hello. Oh, hi. How are you? Kevin, is it? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. You left abruptly. Everything all right? Yes. Yeah. You never finished telling me your story. Oh, I changed my mind. It wasn't... really a police matter. OK. PHONE RINGS Well, if, er, there's anything I can do. Sure. Hello? 'Is that Catherine?' Yeah. It's Mickey from the Curry House up Rawson Lane. That fella you were looking for's been in. 'Just now. 'I came outside for a smoke when he left so I could keep an eye on him, 'and I saw where he went. I saw which house he went in.' I've got to go. I'll be with you in five minutes.
