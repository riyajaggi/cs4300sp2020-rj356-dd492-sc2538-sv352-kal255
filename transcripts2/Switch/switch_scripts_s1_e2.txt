Aw, she's all right. We used to be quite close whenwe were kids, me and Alexa. Before you lot. She used to tie you up andforce you to eat mustard. Yeah, that bit wasn't so great. You should've stuck with it. Her wardrobe is bigger than my bedroom. Yeah, but if you think about it though, would you actually want that lifestyle? Yes, absolutely. You know, I wouldn't.

Brilliant. And it's a final warning. I'm taking this to tribunal,it's completely unfair. "Abusive to customers, drinking on the job, and repeated unexplained absence." Good luck with that.

No, I'm late for work already. We can't the spell book outevery time you mess up at work. Jude! Exactly how much phone sex did you have with that Cuban guy last month? Just a little bit, why? Because we've got a phonebill here for a grand. He only lives in Tootie. Why not just have proper sex then? I'm afraid it's like a like Antonio Banderas. Anyway, do not point your finger at me. Well, I've only used my workphone, Hann hasn't been here, and Grace doesn't have any other friends. Sorry, Grace. So it can only-- It was me. I called Hann a fewtimes while she was away. I really missed her. I'll pay half. Is that before or after you pay me back for the last two months rent? Yeah, I forgot-- you don't have a job. We cannot get by on two incomes.

I hear you're interested inour position of office manager. Yes. Yes, I am. So Hannah, what skillscan you bring to this role? um, I can um-- I'm very resourceful, good in a crisis, always thinking outside the box. I thrive on new challengesand from the satisfaction of performing well. Either as part of a team or by myself. You look fantastic. Thank you for coming. Thank you for inviting me. Leg's better? Yeah. It took me ages to work up the courage to call you this morning. Really? Yeah, I was so nervous. Me too. I must have sounded like a total weirdo. No, no, not at all. We're here now anyway,that's the important thing. So then, I managed to divertthe hijacker's attention, untie the bus driver, andcall the Colombian police. Yeah, I think that was definitely the trickiest situation I've had to resolve. Gosh, well, I mean, that's-- really impressive to say the least. Thank you for coming in, Hannah. It's been a real pleasure to meet you. Yes, thank you. Just one final question-- and this is always a tricky one-- how would you describe your weaknesses? Well that's piss easy. I'm a kleptomaniac. If it's not nailed down, I'll fucking have it. Joke-- obviously. Sense of humor, big tick. Thank you, we'll, -- we'll be in touch. You better happy, you big bastard shit! I'm so sorry. I am so, so sorry. I-- I really-- Stell, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's OK, I know. It's Alexa. Argh! Last night I told her how I wanted to settle down and get a job. And now she's hexed your career. At least it's just me this time. What am I gonna do? Right, but first of all, Ineed to sort this mess out. And what am I gonna do? Just go home, I'll see you there. But don't worry, we'll sort it out. I'm not entirely sure how but we will. Sure you don't want a starter? Walnut overboard. Sorry, can I just-- Don't like making a mess. Little memento from our first date. So tell me a bit more about yourself. Um, I come from a big family. Four brothers and sisters,two fantastic parents, all incredibly close. Sounds lovely. It was. I came home from school one day and, um-- they'd all gone. Just like that. Faulty gas oven and some dodgy electrics. Your entire family? Things were tough for a while but they picked up again when I met my ex, Sarah. Then she got pregnant. Boy or girl? Boy. But he's not mine. She ran off with my best friend. Hey, hey. I'm fine now though. How? I've met you, haven't I? What is going on? This sexy man is the best boss ever. True that. That's what is going on. There's a huge queue out there. I did put a sign on the door. So-- Yeah, reckon they probably missed that. Sorry, Miss Poppins. I think they're getting pissed off. It'll only be a few more minutes. Why don't you? Because I've only got one pair of hands. Stop being so anal. What? I'm about at least-- We're flocking clothes, sweet cheeks. Not saving lives. - I know. All I'm saying is if headoffice come down here-- Head office. Whatever. Listen, I'm sorry if I'm stressing you out. You're not. It's just, I think you shouldn't take things so seriously. I spend my whole life nottaking things seriously. Just because you're smokingweed in the stockroom doesn't make you some big fucking radical. In fact, I could have you for breakfast. With what? Folding shirts? Overproof rum? Last one standing wins? Shut the shop, dickspin. This is the best day of my life. Which is not saying much, though, is it? Um, ha. Look, Joel-- I like you, Grace. I like you so much. I like you too but-- Shh. I can't tell you how many timesI've thought about ending it before I met you. So I just want to say-- thank you for saving my life. You're welcome. [MUSIC - BEN COCKS, "PICTURE OF ME"] We could be lovers. Why don't you take a picture of me, boy? Has someone seen my keys? Boys, stop it. Haven't they gone yet? I can't find my keys. I have those spare oneshere, I want them back though. Why didn't you tell me you have spares? Because you'll lose those as well. I have to go. Sam, don't bite that. Where are you going? I'm going to get somethingof Alexa's to lift this hex. The book says it needs to be of intimate value. I used to have a necklace herdad gave her but I lost that. A lock of hair, her first pony. Lost her pony? She gave it to me and it-- well, it sort of drowned. It doesn't matter, thepoint is this time I'm going to get something and keep it. How did the date go? Um, yeah. Yeah, he's really-- keen. See? You don't have any ideas of how we can get something precious of Alexa's? How did you get in there? Snuck in when you weren't looking. This is a terrible idea. Shh. We're corrupting them. That happened years ago. Hello. Bubble job. Bubble what? I'm a scout, I'm raisingmoney doing odd jobs. - Like what? - All sorts. He's in. Lawn mowing, pond cleaning,massaging, anything really. Hairdresser? You could do with one. I do great fringes. I don't need a haircut off a Boy Scout. I'm cheap. He's got one of her handbags. Good taste, Sam. Where are your parents? Dead. OK, I'll take that as a no. Wait, I have a red wine stain on my rug. Sorry, bye. You thieving bastard! Shit. [MUSIC - RACHEL BARROR, "LIAR, LIAR"] People talk about youwhen I mention your name. I can tell they love youbut they don't wanna say. Checking if we're lovers and then walking away. Shit, you're good. I take it all back. How did you become a manager anyway? Fuck knows. I'll tell you a secret though-- my heart's not in it. Never kiss. I'm in a band, guitarist, et cetera. I'm a fashion designer. A very sexy one. They really need to clean up down here. Come on. We're going. Come on. And you are Hannah, is that right? Yes, yes. I'm their babysitter. I want all three of them arrested. One thing at a time, please. She's obviously put them up to this. Haven't you? This has been one big misunderstanding. This has been devastating. I feel violated. Violated by a child. Aye, aye! Woo! Look who it is. What the fuck's going on here? Have you been drinking, madame? Have you been a prick all your life? Right. In the van, all of ya. Now! Wicked. All of ya, in the van. Now. Get in there, please. What? Give that here. Come on. Grace? No. Have you got your spell book with you? Yeah, but it's not much usewithout something to cast in, is it? Quick switch, anyone? What is it now? Could you take us home, please? No sweat, hot stuff. I just want to know whyeverything you touch turn-- You are so irresponsible. Those are Dave's kids, he's a widower! Don't you shout at me, I wastrying to help your love life. OK, let's just be glad that we were all there and we could do something about it. You know, you're older thanme but you're like a big kid. Stella's right, we can't ask you to do anything. Toby, where's Sam? God. Sam? Sam. Sam? Sam? Toby, when was the last time you saw him? He was playing with a lightsaber. The front door's open. Sam? Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam. Sam! Sam, this isn't a game! Sam! No! No! Keep still, don't move. Get an ambulance! He just ran out. I can't move my arm. What's going on? Life rewind.It's brilliant, isn't it? You are not allowed off thissofa until your father comes. You know not to run out in traffic. Your mother got knocked over by a car. Have you not learned any lessons? Perhaps Grace and I should deal with this. Fine. What happened? You are very, very lucky. We all were. What were you doing out there anyway? I was just play with the lightsaber. What lightsaber? Where did you get this? The rich lady's house. Spirit, take these personal effects. Cast the curse, lift the hex. Hannah's career it shall not rob. Give back the chance to gain a job. Protect her from those by who are to be met. Let her go forth and earn some rent. Bitches. I am so sorry. I will pay for any damage. Which one of them was it? It was Toby, wasn't it? It wasn't me, it was magic. What have I told you about lying? They've been a nightmare. It's OK, you can say it. Hannah's been looking after them. They've been great. Hannah can do magic, they all can. And look, I got a lightsaber. Ha, that's-- yeah, that's mine. And Hannah's got a remotecontrol that can make us cry and rewind time. And we went to the police van. They had lights on and everything. And I lied to a rich girl in a castle. And I stole her handbag. OK, I may need to borrow that remote at some point in the future. Thank you, Hannah, I've notseen them like this before. They're great kids. Tough day. I had a date. Yeah? But it was-- I know. Make a lot of effort, get all excited, but it's just not there. And I feel really guiltybecause he's had an awful life. And-- this isn't me being big-headed but I think he might quite like me. First of all, his happinessisn't your responsibility. Secondly, of course he likes you. You're beautiful. He'll find a girl, everyone'sspecial to someone. - I hope so. - Of course. Just got to find the right one. Can I ask you a question? Does this need salt? I've got bad news and just news. Yeah? Head office have been on. They found out about you closing early-- you're sacked. Yeah, I lasted a whole day. Pretty impressed myself. What's the just news? Meet the new manager. Good for you! Congratulations. That's amazing. Celebration dinnerready in about 10 minutes. Time for a quicktour around the flat then. I can watch the pan, yes. Absolutely. I shouldn't rely on Grace as much as I do. I think she puts herself out for me quite a bit. That's Grace. You're a natural though. No, I'm not. You are. Here. It's fine. It's only fair, you've done a fantastic job. It's fine, really. Listen, the boys been blacklisted by every nanny agency. You deserve a paying. Hannah? Could you just move back a bit? I've had a few problemswith earning money recently. Is everything O-- OK? Yes, everything's great! So I've just-- I've just sort of earned this. You have. And you have a future husband in Sam if it doesn't work out withthe people you're.. And if you want to earn any more then I'm always looking forpeople to do the school pick ups and all the boring stuff. No, not really. Well, it's like a job. Come on, boys. It's time to go and mess up our nice clean flat. Say goodbye to Hannah. See ya, Hannah! Bye! Do you think we lifted the career hex? I know we did, Dave just paid me. I got paid for something! No. Hey! What are you doing? Do you live around here? How mad is that? This is where I come to. It's my hood, it's my stomping gr-- You were watching my flat. I've blown it, haven't I? I knew I would. Why, why-- just for once-- can't something go right for me? One little bit of luck. That's all I'm asking for. It's nothing to do with luck. Take some responsibility. Please don't cry. Um, I-- I do try, you know? I try really, really hard. Maybe that's the problem. You can't force things. They'll either happen or they won't. Will we happen? I don't think so, sorry. You'll find a girlfriend when you're ready. Nobody will have me. That's not true. Everyone's special to someone. Joel? Yeah? Let go now, please. Hello, Gerry. You smell nice. I love women's bathrooms. Don't know what half thatstuff's for but I just wiped it on and rubbed it anyway. Here, feel that. Like a baby's ass. It's lovely. Sorry, do you want to get in there? No, no, no, I was just passing. And en route to the living room. Don't fight your feelings-- fight your sweat. What? I don't think she'll like that. Women don't sweat, apparently. Don't we? No, we perspire. Try telling that tosomeone with hyperhidrosis. Stella, what the hell are you talking about? Excessive sweating-- new campaign. I've got to makeindustrial-strength deodorant Why Janet has given this to me, I don't know. God, do I smell? No. Why me then? Because if anyonecan make BO cool, you can. That was meant to come out differently. No, stop it. You don't smell. You're sexy, that's why she's given it to you. I don't feel very sexy. Well, you are. When was the last time I went on a date? That lovely woman from Bassie Doc's home. Her clothes were covered inhair and she had half-eaten chew sticks in her pocket. And that was 2009. Well, you're picky. It's a good thing. High standards. Can't force these things. You know, someone will comealong when you least expect it. It's all about the chemistry. - That's it. - Exactly. Why go on a load of meaninglessdates just for the sake of it? No, no, no-- the tagline. It's all about the chemistry. Perfect! - Right, great. Laters. It's all about the chemistry. I'll have that. Bills. Why is it just when weget our coven back together, To do with the natural balance of things. Annette's got a coven togetherbecause we're back together. I'm not too sure about them. Why not? 'Cause they're not proper mates? They're proper witches. I don't get it. Well, it's like sex, isn't it? It's better with someone you love. Magic is not like sex, Judith. It is and we're better at it than they are. We are. If they try anything again, we'll have them because we're betterin the magical sack than them. I'm not going to agree with you until you find a more polite metaphor,thank you very much. Come and have sex with us. I'm not listening. Come on, Grace. At least come and have a drink with us. Cheers. Excuse me. - Bloody hell. - I know. What do you have to do toget a drink around here? Stella, that fit woman wastotally giving you the eye. What was that? Let me have that. Where are you going? Let's go. Don't stare, you'll make her feel awkward. Dude. What? They're not mating pandas. I can look if I want. Can you lip read? What are they saying? Hair-- em-- pork-- chair. Hairy pork chair. Is that a lesbian thing? Yeah, it must be unlessyou can't actually lip read. Did yous? She's called Ariel. Of course she is. What did she say? She said she thinks I'm really attractive. Do I want to go for a drink? Blah blah, blah. She makes Megan Fox look likeAnne Whitaker and you're blind. It's not all about looks. Did you get on, Stell? Yeah. Yeah, we got on. She seems great. But? I don't know what's wrong with me, I think I've got a condition. This keeps happening to me. You keep gettingpropositioned by supermodels? Stella, you poor bastard. No, I mean, I can't seem to connect-- romantically. It's like I go through the motion but I-- I just can't find that spark. It's like something inside ofme has just been switched off. I need another drink. This is awful. That's just Stella, isn't it? She's, um-- fussy. It's been five years sinceStella had a relationship. Coincidence. No. We need to get in touch with Lucy. No. You'd rather see our friend single forever than deal with it? Yes. Come on, Jude, she's right. Well, you may be happy for Stella to die alone surrounded by cats, but we're not. We need to lift a switch andif that means getting Lucy to come over, then so be it. I'll text Olive tomorrow. Last order, so I thought I'd double up. Cheers. Coming. Cheers.
