Needing the cash Hannah agrees to tutor Cricklewood witch's daughter Tuppence to get her into a good coven. Tuppence is tactless and friendless but,having helped the others create a truth spell - which makes Gerry admit his love for Grace - she comes to see it is better to be in a friendly coven than an elite one.

Um, well, I don't want him to go, and if I help him with someposters, then he'll stay. Don't try and figure outwhat's going on in his head. Just relax. I'm relaxed. He's got a problem. And if I help him with it, thenhe'll realize that I am nice. Why are you so obsessed with him? Where's your fucking pens? I'm sorry. Just don't want him to go yet. Hey. It's me. What are you doing? - Hannah Bright? - Yes. Come in. We're spending solstice in Chipping Norton. We're good to be mixing withsome very powerful witches. You're looking for a coven? We can't let anything getin the way of her getting on. I'm working three jobs to payfor all the extra tuition. Do you live here? Yes, with my coven. Do you want a cup of tea? No. No, I'm late for work. Now, I'll see you at 8:00,then I'll take you to fencing. Oh, I thought it was conversational French? French's Monday, Day horse riding Tuesday. Wednesday public speaking,Thursday elocution, Friday ballet, SaturdayWicca and late night fencing. That's a lot of extra tuition. If this goes well, I know a lot of other moms I can send your way.

[music playing] I see the mountains in the water. I see the flowers in the bed. I feel the power that it brought us. It's calling, calling,calling, calling us together. JUDE: Oh, that's it, Mike. I can slot you in around 1:30. OK, great. [moaning] Speed dating. [moaning] Natalie, hi. Stella Monroe. Hello. [screaming] Uh, no, that-- that's-- that's the neighbors. Right. A couple of quick fire questionsto get you warmed up, Natalie. [moaning] Yep. Good. Heh. Yeah, I'm going to justcome right out and say this, but that one time we met, Isaved your name as Fit Tits. And now I can't remember what your name is. I'll take a picture, so-- Hmm. So. The thing about Wicca is it's all about balance. Do you want to write any of this down? You're getting paid. You write it down. OK. Um, balance. You can get balance when the four-- TUPPENCE: -- elements are in concert. Earth, fire, air and water. Air and water are the cooling elements, and fire and earth are the warming elements. Listen, Hannah. It's Hannah, right? Yeah. Hannah, I need to getan edge on everyone else. Do you understand what I mean by edge? Yeah. Has anything you'vesaid to me since I walked in here given me an edge? Probably not, no. So the question I'm asking you, Hannah, is are you up to the job? All right. If you're so smart, why don't you do the lesson? Fine. I will. Historically, covens arecreated by earth elements, bearing children and forming with three daughters. I actually didn't know that. Well, mummy's invested heavilyin my extra tuition, so-- What was your last coven like? Oh, pff, well. There's been so many, it'sdifficult to say, really. What was your air element like? I'm an air. I think it's really funnyhow we're all a bit the same. Was she always losing things? Losing things? Oh. Oh yeah. Losing things. All the time. Yeah. Had to slap her. Such a twat. Nightmare. You have been in a coven, right? You're 15 years old. You must've been. Well, anyway. Um. I think I'd like to talkabout, um, seasonal spells. What about, like,playground covens, where you all go around holding hands? Tuppence, you have been in a coven. Well, I mean, maybe not officially, but-- So-- [laughter] GERRY: They say this is-- is it? No. No. Mike. Did you only come round for the sex? I thought that was the point. GRACE: Stop. No. Stay. Now. I've got work. Pull a sicky. Are you serious? I never pull sickies. I never ask you to stay. [laughter] Hello, Robbie? Look, um, I can't make the grant meeting today. Yeah. Um, something's come up. I've got a stiff neck. Let's see how stiff that neck is. I love my job, uh, my family. I've got a nice life, and Iwant to share it with someone. What's your name again? Julia. Well, you've got a great look, but that was distinctly average. It's a no for me, I'm afraid. You know, when you firstsat down, I had high hopes, but nerves just got thebetter of you, didn't they? Uh, next. Next. I'm gay. I'm Trevor. No, I am gay. I've been speed dating women all lunchtime, in case you hadn't noticed. I like a challenge. So, 44, financiallysolvent, all my own teeth. I'm here for good time, not a long time. In short, I put the rev back into Trev. And off is the directionI would like you to fuck. Hmm. What if I told you that deepdown, I'm the sensitive type? Cat lover. Cocoa. Meow. How about you put your digits in there? The only digit you'll begetting from me is this. Why do you have so many clothes? I design clothes. Made that. Made that cushion. Huh. What's in a cushion? Feather, down. That one's somethingcalled viscoelastic foam. What do you do? Huh? - For a job? - Me? Oh, um. I work for the Museum of Natural Science. In the shop? No, I'm a curator. Of the museum? No. Uh, marine mollusks and cephalopods. I preserved the eminence'slargest wet specimen. It's a meter and a half giant clam. I had a tank speciallydesigned and built and filled yeah. So, yeah. Museum of Natural Science. What's a mollusk? Do you wanna sit here? Yeah, sure. So, coffee? Uh, no. I don't do caffeine. Really? I've got loads of herbal teas. Oh, no. I'm not really a hot drink sort of person. Squirty cream? I just have it straight. No. Um. Sunflower seeds? No, I'm fine. JUDE: Rice cracker? MIKE: No, honestly, Jude. Chalk ice? Yes, great. You-- you like chalk ice. Yeah. Yes. Listen, Tupps. If I can get you into a coven, your mom's going to send all the other moms my way, and I can stop being skint. I think I know why you'venever been in a coven before. It's because you don't have any friends. Am I right? What do you do with other girls? Whatever I want. What do you do to relax? Whatever I want. OK. If you had some people to hangout with, what would you do? Whatever I want. Oh. You're such a dick. I'm a dick? Yes. You don't have any friendsbecause you're a dick. No one talks to me like that. No one talks to you anyway. Look, I don't have to stand for this. - Tuppence. - Get out of my way. No, I'm sorry.I shouldn't have said that. I'm the dick. - You are a dick. It's just, your mom gives you everything. That's normal. I mean, doesn't yourmother give you everything? We're not talking about my mom. The point is, your mom can't buy you friends. You have to earn them. And you can. You just need a bit of help from me. I'm not a dick. No. You're not. I am. Say you're a dick. You're a dick. Oh! Oh! You made a little joke there. Yes, I did. Well spotted. Right. You can make friends. I know you can. Can't you? Yes. Right. What do we want? - Friends. When do we want them? Now. Let's see what you've got. JUDE: Oof. Lunch is a disaster. We might have to head out. I've just got a load of random shit. Got some seafood from yesterday. Do you want lunch? Uh, shit. I'd better get going, actually. Oh. Is there anything else I can help you with? Uh, no. I've got everything, I think. Thanks for last night. See you later. Oh. Your-- your jumper. Ah. Oh, god. Well, I suppose I did pull a sicky. Normal rules don't apply. Can we wash these mytilus edulis? Are these mollusks? These are mollusks. These wonderful creatures survive in deep dark depths of cold and darkness by clumping together to form a gang. We could learn a lotfrom these little fellas. And these are mercenaria mercenaria. So good they named them twice. Mollusks are actually quite cool, aren't they? Exactly, that's what I'm saying. They're the gangsters of the zoological world. I mean, Calcareous shell, unsegmented body, what's not to like? Exactly. Wish I could take youto my grant meeting today. The director of research is a real bitch for the herpetology wankers. What's herpetology? Reptiles, amphibians. They get all the funding. I hate lizards. Where've you been all my life? Hello. Uh, Tuppence Mill. Um, look. If we're going to be friends,you're going to need to project less sexual confidence, as it's also mistaken for sexual availability, which I don't think reflects well on either of us. Um. Good effort. We just need to work on a few things, like thinking about the other person's feelings. Hey. Gerry's just gone. That doesn't mean anything, does it? Let's ask Tuppence. Think about Grace's feelings. Oh, OK. Um. Well, have you-- have you made any plans to see each other again? No. Uh, that doesn't meananything, though, does it? Only that he feels nothing for you. Oh shit. A booty call. A booty call. - Looks that way. - No. No. GRACE: The first time we had sex, I was under a confidence spell. And then last night was thefirst time with the real me. Oh, I've blown it. Grace! That was amazing. Thank you. I didn't think it could getmuch better than this morning, but it has. Now, I know we hardly know each other, but do you, um, do you want to go out with me? What? You can cook. You can, eh. You've got a good job. I don't know. You sure? All right, yeah. Oh. It's Robbie. Wish me luck. Good luck. Robbie, did we get the funding? How are the dates? Don't ask. I think I just got a boyfriend. What? MIKE: Was Fred there? Oh, yes. You and Gerry are all right, you know? MIKE: What did she say? Yeah. I was going to ask you about that. Would you mind ringing him for me? Why? I don't want to be a complete psycho, but you're so muchbetter at this than I am. And you can just call him and ask him to come round or something. Will you? Please? Why do you need to hangout with him all the time? MIKE: What did she say? What did she say? I need him to want me. He's a bloke. If he thinks he can have sexwith you, he'll come round. Mine did. Not with me. You have had sex with him. If that's the only thing I've got to offer, then I don't think he'll be coming back, OK? Why? I don't think I'm very good at it. MIKE: What did she say? What did she say? Well, was Fred there? Ask him to come round tonight.MIKE: What was he wearing? Hey, Gerry. It's Jude. Do you, um, do you want to come round tonight? Oh, my mobile died. Grace's mobile died and she'sjust thinking about numbers. What did you say, Robbie? What did you say? What time? Oh, you two-facedmanipulative bastard, Robbie. I will destroy you, Robbie! I will turn you into a fucking invertebrate with my bare hands, Robbie. I will soak you in formalsaline, put you in a jar, and label you a patheticfucking ball bag forever! I will kill! Die! Uh. Didn't get the funding. Broken that. It's-- it's all right. What the hell was that about? He, uh, he really wanted the funding? What makes you think that? Tell him to go, Jude. No. Look, we've all have bad days at the office. He's just passionate, that's all. I thought more of you lot. You're so quick to judge. He killed his phone with his shoe. - Look, I've got to go. - Don't. He's crazy. - Excuse me. I'm not going to find agirlfriend in the bathroom. And Gerry's coming over tonight, and I don't want him ruining everything. Yeah. And I don't want himscaring Tuppence anymore. This is my career, you know. Oh, don't worry about me, mate. No. I'll be fine. Sorry about earlier. Robbie really winds me up. I'm glad that it happenedhere and not at work though. Couple of mollusks wouldhave it got it, would they? Something like that, yeah. Um, where you going? I think I'm going to popinto Gerry's rehearsals. I thought I said play it cool? No, I think it's better tosee him before he gets here. Oh. Well, this isn't mine. It must be Stella's. Take it to her. Remember everything I said. Don't come back until you're friends. OK. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, hello. Uh, it's Tuppence. You've got a message from Pussycat Moll. Give it here. Who is Pussycat Moll? Just some girl that Iliked on a dating website. Um, seeing as we're both earth elements, do you find that everyoneelse is a bit more sensitive about things? Oh, they're all too wet for their own good. This girl could change everything. A grade salary, hates Irish dancing, perfect. See? With a little bit oforganization and tenacity, Like a coven. Or a girlfriend. You just got to put the hours in. Come on, sit. Let's practice small talk. Oh, OK. Well, um, uh. Oh, it's hard. We're rubbish, aren't we? Well, you know, I don't think small talk's going to help you anyway. Really? Well, it's been scientificallyproven that people narrow their mating opportunities using age, weight, and height as proxiesof socioeconomic status. So you might be perfect for Pussycat Moll, but she'll probably judge you on something like how fat your arms are. And before you know it,she's left you with the bill and taken both the mints. Are you saying I've got fat arms? Oh, no. No. Are you saying she's not going to like me? No, I never said that. Because I've got fat arms. I'm not very good at this. You horrible little ass pipe. I am just getting dressed to go out and you say stuff like that. What is wrong with you? Please, I'm just trying to-- You are such a dick. Get out. Sorry. How'd it go? Tuppence. Oh, good luck. What if she's really picky like me? What if I really likeher, but she doesn't like me because I've got fat arms? HANNAH: Tuppence! MIKE: Oh, fucking hell. These cakes are delicious. I've parked up there. So? I just saw traffic wardengoing up that street. I have to sort this out. Don't eat all the cakes. No I love it. There is no band called Talibandown in the [inaudible].. I'm being serious. What are you doing here? Ah, well, I thought ratherthan waiting for you to come round, I'd pop by with cakes. Hello, I'm-- Yeah, you don't need to be meet them. Why not? We're rehearsing, so-- You're sitting around drinking. We're artists. Give us a break. I'll come round after. Don't bother. For the band, not for you. He ran off down there. Oh, god, are you worried? A bit. Where's Tuppence? Ah, she's locked herself in the bathroom and she won't come out. What happened? Nothing. You were out of milk. Should we have Chinese? I feel like Chinese. - Um, I don't think so. - What about Indian? I could do Indian. Or Lebanese. Ooh. Mezze platter. Yeah, I'm not really surethis is working for me. - Why? - I don't know, really. Well, it's great. We're great. Just give me one reason whywe shouldn't be together? There's no one reason. - I want a reason.- Lots of things, really. I've got a boyfriend. Why? I'm an idiot. Where is he? Hawaii? Where? Oil rigs. The oil rigs. I, uh, I have needs. I'm not a good person. Is he still away? That's the thing. He's back. I just had a message while you were out. I had a message, and he's back early. So-- I missed out on the biggestresearch grant of my career for an afternoon with you. I know. And if it wasn't for this otherguy, you know, hello boyfriend. I should go. What if I talk to him? - No. Yes. You deserve so much better than this. You shouldn't be neglectedand lonely, sleeping around behind his back. Together, we can confront him. No, that's not a good idea. What time's he coming around? He's got a terrible temper. I lost my funding for an afternoon with you. And you know what? You're worth it. Now, what time's he coming around? About 08:00? Perfect. Leave this with me. [music playing] I've come with this style. I bring you this cool. Excuse me. Is that clock right? Ah. Stella. Hi. I was just leaving. Oh, don't let me stop you. Just been in a meeting. Potential new clients, very exciting. Don't ask. Can't talk about it yet. Right. Just, uh, off home now. Are you alone? Yeah. Yeah, I've been stood up. Oh, dear. Do you want a drink? I thought you were in a rush. Oh, well, I'm sure my catwon't mind waiting another hour or so. Two, uh, Tory Wankers, please. BARTENDER: No problem. Tuppence, please come out. Go away. How did it go? Fine. Um, I need a bath. Grace, you only ever have a bath when something's freaking you out. What's happened? - Nothing. It's fine. I'd just like a bath. No problem. Just go back in, yeah? TUPPENCE: Just go away. She's locked herself in. What happened? Nothing. You know, you click your fingers and they come running, whereas I sleep with them and they leave running. Open this door now. Did you have a fight? Yeah, before I felt like Ididn't have any confidence, and now I feel like I've lostconfidence, which is way worse. Let's just calm down. I am calm. Ooh. Ooh. I-- just let me go. I-- I want to have a bath. OK. How about-- how about we do alittle truth switch on Gerry? We'll ask him if you likes you, and that way, you know what's going on. Um, Stella's on a date. So-- A switch got you into this mess. Another will get you out.- Truth switch? Yeah. OK. But Stella's out. Tuppence, have you been listening? TUPPENCE: Uh, yeah. You want to help? Um, OK. Look, I'm an earth element. I know how to cut that up. I could do it for you, if you'd like. Spirit gracious, spirit kind, please let us into someone's mind. Make him utter only truth,show his hand and offer proof. Reveal intentions good or bad,is he for real or Jack the lad? You're shit. Come on, mate. Don't be like that. I'm so sorry, but Islept with your girlfriend. And your girlfriend tried to sleep with me, but I turned her down becauseI was sleeping with his. I mean, why do people do that? Why make an arrangement if youcan't be bothered to turn up? Shoddy. Stella, I didn't have a meeting. I have been stood up too. No way. Fucking way. Why? Why? Nobody stands me up withoutgetting an abusive email. [phone notification] Oh, here we go. Lame excuse alert. Oh, she's here. Red dress. You're Pussycat Moll? You're CamdenGirl87. You're not gay. Janet? Listen, darling, whenyou've been through the amount of assholes that I have, you'd tick interested in men and women, too. I really fancied your profile.

Do you know Jude puts recycling with the normal rubbish? I can't believe you! I'm sorry. I just can't be bothered sometimes. Oh, you are in so much trouble. You must be Hannah's new student. How's it going? Well, I've learnt lots. But she's not a proper teacher. I know, but-- but she's a proper friend. She'll be doingsomething else next week. She confuses her ventures withrunning away from her problems. All right. Um, why didn't you letme meet the band earlier? Are you embarrassed? - Yeah. Oh. Fine. Of the band. They're such a bunch of indie twats. I'm not like them. You're not like them. - What do you think about Grace?- No. You don't have to. Well, I'd love it if Graceand I could have like a fling. Oh. Like a no strings kind ofsex thing, no commitment. But I can't do that. Why not? Because I fell in love with her last night. Ah! My iPad! Remind me to talk toyou about lifting spells. I've had the best day ever. What have you learned? Loads. Stella let me drink alcohol. Who's Stella? I was kissed by a boy. What boy? TUPPENCE: And I broke my iPad. I can explain. But mom, the bestthing is, I cast a spell. A truth spell. Ah! How was she? She was brilliant. You've done a great job. TUPPENCE: But mom, I don't wantto get into the best coven. I want to get into the right coven for me. OK? You know, Tuppence doesn'tneed all this extra tuition. She just needs practice making friends. Perhaps she could start with you. Why don't you skip fencing tonight and take your mom out and say thank you? Well, yeah. Let's go out for dinner. - OK. Fine. Hooray. I've never seen her like this before. Thank you, Hannah. Oh, clearing up for solstice? Something like that. Where's Grace and Gerry? Mm. I think they're-- Oh, right. Han. Do you, um, do you think I'm a bad friend? What? Of course not. I think I was a bit of a dick about Gerry. No, you weren't. I should be happy for her. You're happy for her. He's not going to take her away from us. But what if it's never the same again? It will be. But we finally got you back. If she really loves him,she's going to give it a go, and she'll move in with him. You can't worry about stuff like that. Our coven hasn't lasted this long because we haven't changed. It's lasted because we change all the time. Look at these photos. Oh. Oh, look at your hair. Don't. I've avoided half of them. Ha. Look at Grace. What are you looking for? Ah, just having a sort out. No, you're looking for something. I can help. It's fine. Look, please. I feel like a bad friend. Let me do something. Tuppence's mom was soexcited about her first switch. It reminded me of thefirst time I cast a spell. My mom took a picture ofus with my casting spoon. Well, it must be here somewhere. I've checked everywhere. I hate being an air element. I can't find anything ever. Well, what you want it for, anyway? I don't know. Just now I've thought about it, I want it, and it's stressing me out. You sure it's just the picture you're missing? How was the date? Yeah, it went brilliantly. Just not for me. You know, I don't think I'm the best person for the job when it comesto finding the right person. GRACE: Tolster's might be agood place to find somebody. You all right, Brighty? Does anyone know where my mom is? I need to see her. [music playing]
