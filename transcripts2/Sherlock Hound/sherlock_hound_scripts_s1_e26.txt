 FAMOUS DETECTIVE HOLMES Good-bye Holmes! The Last Case I want to be a bird. Miss Elizabeth. Please get ready. I understand. The longer you wait, the more happiness grows. Yes. You look beautiful. Thank you. The ceremony is about to begin. Come, we must hurry.

 You look beautiful, Elizabeth. Just like your mother when she was your age. Father. We've kept your groom waiting. Let's go. She's late. The man is always the one who waits, Robert. You'd better start getting used to it. Here they come. What?! That's impossible! The bride has disappeared? How interesting. And quite dramatic! Maybe "too dramatic", wouldn't you say?

 Indeed. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't take this so lightly. Please, Mr. Holmes! Could you come to the church immediately? But we were just about to eat lunch. You can have lunch anywhere. I suppose that's true. Oh, my! We're stepping out. But... We're stepping out. I'm afraid we won't have time for lunch. That's why I've made you some sandwiches. Wow! Your powers of deduction are just as insightful as Holmes. This is good. Mr. Holmes, I believe this was a kidnapping. A kidnapping? That's right. But when I spoke to Inspector Lestrade, he said... This is simply a case of a bride changing her mind. How can you be so inconsiderate, saying that to me! I know it may be hard to accept, but... I believe myself to be a good judge of people. If that is true, then, how would you explain... the disappearance of Lord Racliff, her father?! His pattern of reasoning is illogical. In any event, let us hurry to the scene of the incident. A cigar butt? This was made in India. That's probably Lord Racliff's. I see. Judging from those ashes... it is certain that Lord Racliff was here and waiting for his daughter. When the bride came out of the dressing room, they both... began walking along this corridor, towards the chapel. This is "White Company"! That's right. This section was constructed by Count Saxon... a man who greatly valued chivalry. Ouch! What's wrong, Watson?! Look what I've found. This is a piece of Indian cloth. Look. There is evidence that someone has moved this wall. Funny you should mention India. Do you know something? Well, Lord Racliff had been residing... in Kirikibul, India, until just recently. I see. The bride and Lord Racliff were taken away by someone... who knew them while they were living in India. But Alice said nobody left this room. If nobody left the room, that means they disappeared inside of it. It is likely they were ambushed by the kidnappers from behind the door. As they unwittingly walked into the room... they were forced to inhale some kind of knockout drug... and then taken away. But, how? I'll show you that now. The key is probably in this Latin inscription. "First give strength on the right, and then on the center" Nobody's ever known what that meant. But the kidnappers did. I see. Shall we begin, Watson? When you need weight, you can count on me. Anytime you're ready. All right! "Give strength on the right" "Give strength on the right... and then, give strength on the center." Like this. Nothing? How odd. "Give strength on the right" Ouch! "Then, give strength on the center!" This is... a passageway! Let's go. What are we going to do?! This is what they used to escape. Therefore there must be an exit. Let's go. Let's go. Is anything wrong? Are you scared? No, I'm not. Are you all right? Maybe we should go back. That was nothing! What? A corsage. That proves that the kidnappers took this underground passage. And, they were in a hurry. They left this behind, too. A monocle. Moriarty! That's right. That dirty thief must be having a fit. No! It's gone! My monocle's gone! You must have dropped it again. It was dark in there. What? That monocle was a part of me! How dare you treat its disappearance so lightly! A spare. Yes sir! Here you go, Professor. Very good. Somebody's there. Lord Racliff! Lord Racliff, are you all right? Oh, Dolan! Elizabeth, Elizabeth has been kidnapped... by him! By Avagen! Avagen?! He's here in London? Yes. And he took my Elizabeth away. They must have escaped by ship from here. By the way, who is Avagen? They met while Lord Racliff was stationed in India. He is the third prince of Maharaja. So the prince kidnapped the bride? Why? He kept trying to force his attentions on her against her will. But I never dreamed he would do such a terrible thing. This explains the piece of Indian cloth we found. The next step is to find Avagen. We'll probably need the help of Inspector Lestrade. I am Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard. You have a Prince Avagen staying at this hotel. Prince Avagen? He checked out this morning. This morning? Do you have any idea where he went? I believe he said that he is catching the "Alicia" when it sails this afternoon. What time does that ship depart? 6 o'clock, I think. Let's go. Wait, Holmes. Holmes. You have a guest. Mr. Holmes, please don't look for Miss Elizabeth. Why is that? Miss Elizabeth and Prince Avagen are in love with each other. This is perfect. I'm going to arrest those dirty thieves Moriarty and Avagen... with my own two hands. Stealing a bride is the most heinous crime of all! They met during a party at the government house in Kirikibul. Miss Elizabeth was staying in India at the time. Prince Avagen had just came back from studying abroad. Wait up! No! Boo! I caught you! However, people around them, especially her father... completely disapproved of their relationship. And as punishment, Elizabeth was sent back to England. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Prince Avagen! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Prince Avagen! Prince Avagen! Why would Lord Racliff disapprove of their relationship? If they did marry, Miss Elizabeth would become a princess. India is far away. But more importantly, Lord Racliff intends to use... her marriage to strengthen his own businesses. A marriage of convenience. Miss Alice, I completely sympathize with Elizabeth, but... the bride still must be rescued. The men who helped the prince are none other than Moriarty... and his gang of dirty thieves. That means their target is something else. The emerald! Miss Elizabeth wears an emerald called the "Polar Star." It's the heirloom of the Racliff family. That's it! That's what he is after! They are certainly taking their time. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. I don't have much time. Get a move on. The prince hasn't come on board yet. That means they are hiding somewhere nearby... and planning to come on board at the very last minute. I'm having my men watch the harbor... and placed the harbor police's launches on standby on the river. Not even a mouse could escape my sight now. I'm counting on you. Detective Holmes! I got you a boat! I made sure it was perfectly maintained. Well then, let's go aboard and see how well you've done your job. To the Alicia! Right! To the Alicia! Ready to cast off! Ready to cast off! Make it so! Yes, sir! How are they doing? Quiet as mice, sir. Haven't made a peep. This should be interesting! Elizabeth. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. Am I dreaming to have you by my side again? Look closely, Elizabeth. This is not a dream. Prince Avagen! I've come to take you away. Prince Avagen! It really is you, isn't it? I'm sorry to have played so rough. Have you finished with your tearful reunion yet? What do you want? What do I want? A fine way to greet me, Prince Avagen! I just came by to collect my promised reward. Your task is not complete until we are safely aboard the Alicia. Is that so? According to our agreement, your reward is this beautiful bride... and my reward is... that beautiful emerald, I believe. This emerald is not for you. But for your reward, I've prepared more than enough of other valuables. It's beautiful. But, Prince Avagen... you have gained something more valuable than this jewel. That's all I can pay! You know, you're in my control now. I want you to remember that. Don't worry. I promise to deliver you both safely to the Alicia... in exchange for that emerald. We'll be fine. I've come this far for you already. Prince Avagen! Let's go! Yes, sir! I'll show you the vast power of my intellect! It's almost time. Are they coming yet? No, not yet! They're out of time. Here they come. From upriver. It looks like we're really going to pull it off this time! I hope so. Now, Prince Avagen. You'd better hurry and give me the emerald... or you'll miss the boat. You dirty thief! Call me what you like. The clock is ticking. I'll give you the emerald. Elizabeth?! So please take us to the Alicia. See? She understands. Oops! What was that?! What's wrong?! It's them! They've sniffed us out? Curses! Stoke up the boiler! More coal! Yes, sir! Hard aport! Don't think I can be captured so easily. This launch is the fastest in all London. Full speed ahead! They're going all out. Why don't we join them?! All right! Put on more coal! More coal! Not a bad move. Now the real battle begins. Stoke the boiler more quickly! Yes, sir! Yo-heave-ho! Oops! Helm to port! Aye aye, sir! Curse you, Holmes! He dodged. Here, some special gifts for you! Here! Take this! Starboard! Aye aye, sir! Port! Aye aye, sir! Take that! And that! Go to full power! All right. Oops, here we go, here we go. Prince... Turn us back! That's not possible! Damn you! Here! Now that's odd. What's going on?! I have a bad feeling. If they stay on that course, they're going to crash onto shore! Oh, no! The ship is going to... Professor! We are going to run around! Abandon ship! Yes, sir! Avagen! Elizabeth! You two are getting on that ship. What? Then... Miss Alice told me everything. Thank you very much, Detective Holmes. How could we get so dirty? Because we're dirty thieves! Bon voyage! Holmes, I'm curious... About what? How will you explain this to Lord Racliff? I'll just tell him that Inspector Lestrade's deduction was correct. What? This was simply a case of a bride changing her mind. I see.
