 It paralyzes us, which is why we need to move fast. Leave it behind. Leave the darkness... to go out into the light. MEXICO CITY - Hello. - Hi, love. How are you? - How's Madrid? - Good, very good. I'm on my way to the racetrack. Were you able to talk to my mother? Yes, but I don't think I'll be able to see her. - Anyway, what do you want? - You're still mad? I just didn't sleep well and we're running late. Paulina is being annoying. - What's up with Pau now? - She didn't want to get up.

 She wanted to stay home all day on her phone. Do you want me to talk to her? No, forget it. I already talked her into it. Actually, I don't even know how because I... What? - To her, it's like I don't even exist. - Don't be dramatic. - Your daughter loves you. - I don't know. Alejandro, we aren't doing her any good. Listen, our kids are just fine. Don't worry. Our children's lives aren't like other kids' their age. No, no, no. Don't start. You keep thinking about that over and over and over. It's just that I haven't been okay since... No, Magda, I'm tired of you obsessing over this. I'm hanging up or I won't get there on time. Yeah. Kiss the kids for me. - I have to be there at 10:00. - Talk to your sister, then. - We're late. - I didn't want to go! We always leave early for your things. THE GETAWAY - Girls, seat belt. - Yes, it's on. Rubén, sweetie, seat belt. - Rubén, we use our voices to answer. - All right. I don't want you to leave the house without your hearing aid. - Gaby, we talked about this. - Yes, ma'am. Rubén, please put it on. The blue flag. The horses are now waiting for the judge's signal to start. ZARZUELA RACETRACK Stop! Come on, horses! That's it! Come on, horse! What is that? - Is that paint? - Are we being pranked? Drop your weapon! Where are they? Pull over, pull over. No, Rubén, don't get out! Rubén! Sweetie! Sweetie! Let's go! That's my horse! Didn't I tell you? Huh? Pay attention. You will receive instructions. Yes. Yes. Mom. Mom. - Rubén lost his hearing aid. - I know. - Where are they taking us? - Look for it. Look for it, Rubén. Throw your cell phones out the window. Now. Come on, your cell phones! - Come on! - Do what they tell you! Listen. - No, no, no! No, please! - Quiet, guys, please. - Calm your kids down. - We'll follow your instructions. Exactly. Nobody will be harmed if you obey. Okay, here's mine. Give me yours. Here, here they are. Take them. - What do you want? - It doesn't matter what we want. What matters is that you follow my instructions, and everything will be over soon. From this moment on, nobody talks. Now you have to take off your clothes. Now! No. No, no. We're not taking anything off. If money is what you want... Your clothes! I want you to take off your clothes. You will be provided with other clothes. - Come on, let's do as they say. - No, Mom. Yes. Yes! Come on, come on, your clothes! - We're not in a position to say no! - Your clothes, now! Your clothes! - Quickly! - All right, all right. Stop recording. Please. You can keep your underwear. You heard him. Keep following my instructions and do not get out of the car under any circumstances. All right. Come on. Shit. All right, let's make a toast. - Thank you. - Thank you. Here's to the first victory. - Thank you. That's right. - And hoping it's not the only one. Exactly. I don't know, Alejandro. Your offer is very generous, but... I've been chasing you for a year to close this thing. It's hard for me to sell. Those hotels are my life. They carry my family name. I know, and that's not going to change. When I buy a hotel chain, I also buy the name. And it's a lot of money, Andrés. No one is going to offer you more. Besides, money is not the heart and soul of business, passion is! - That's right. - Like with horse races. Horse races are pure passion. Rider against rider, animal against animal. Man and animal as one. Adrenaline, speed. Money is just money. And closing this deal would be pure poetry, wouldn't it? There's my Mexican poet! Excuse me. I'll be right back. Is something wrong? Is something wrong? No. Are you feeling okay? You look pale. - Everything is fine. - You look worried. No, it's just that only a few people have this number and... They must have made a mistake. Look, Andrés, see that tower? It's just wonderful. MEXICO CITY - Dad will get us out of here. - Dad? How, Paulina? - He's thousands of miles away. - Nothing is going to happen. How do you know? Because I won't let them hurt you. You won't let them? What can you do? - I've never lied to you, Pau. - I don't know that. If I say I won't allow it, just believe me. This is your fault. - Paulina, stop it. - My fault? - Your fault. - I said stop it! - You and your stupid tournament. - I didn't ask you to come. I didn't want to go! But you just have to have all the attention to yourself! - You want every damn... - What the hell do you care? Stop it! Stop it. You're scared, you're hysterical. You're wasting all your energy on filling your head with nonsense. And that doesn't help you, it makes you weak. And you're a woman. You can be anything but weak. Alejandro, please. Will you listen to me? FIVE MONTHS EARLIER It's okay! Really, calm down. You can't do this to me. No, nothing's going to happen. I'll be with him at all times. - Give it to me. I said give me the key! - Magda. - No! I'm telling you... - Magda, you're hurting me. You just keep getting stronger, huh? Why is it so hard for you to accept that Rubén isn't like the others? - He has limitations and he can't... - Right. And whose fault is that? You're never going to forgive me for it, are you? Nothing is going to happen. I'll be with him the whole time and we won't leave the residential area. - Have them check the car. - Right. - Check everything. - All right, sir. Done. Don't pay attention to the threats. We get so many threats, more and more frequently. - They have protection. - That doesn't provide absolute safety. You're with me. Nothing is going to happen to you. - Where are you going dressed like that? - To have breakfast. - Naked? - It's a bikini top. - Go upstairs and put something on. - This is my house. I'll dress as I please. No. Ten men work here. Ten young men. Why is it that everything I do is wrong? - You're a woman and you're provoking them. - Am I? It's fun. - Will you please help me? - Let her be. Are we going? How can I say no to him now? Mommy is afraid. I can do it. Do you want to join us? Be very careful, honey. And wear your hearing aid. There, there. Hey, champ! What's up? How are you? - Chendo, all set? - All set! Pedro, our boy! Are you okay? My baby. My baby. Bastards! What happened? I can't take it anymore. Do you hear me? It's over! I can't go on like this! Chendo! Your clothes. If they want money, they can't hurt us, right? That's right. Whatever amount of money they want, Dad will pay them. He'll pay them, won't he? I only ask you to trust me. What are you going to do? First, come to terms with what's happening to us. And then breathe. It's very important to breathe right. Isn't it, Gaby? Tell them, you practice your breathing. Go on. Yes. And then... we need to adapt to this situation. Just like we adapt to the water when we go diving. How do you adapt to a kidnapping? There have been cases of people who were kidnapped for months, even years. And if they survived, it's because they stayed calm. So please, let's stay calm and breathe. You're not breathing calmly, Pau. You're only using the upper part of your lungs. Be calm. You're trying to fix this as if it were a freaking diving lesson? Stop annoying me, Paulina. That's enough. Everything is "no, no, no." Enough! Get out of that hole, you hear me? Otherwise you'll be stuck. What are you doing? Where are you going? - Hey! - Sorry! I'm sorry! Rub your hands together. Come on, do it. Rub your hands together, honey. That's it. Vigorously, like this. And now place them here, on your stomach. Come on. That's it. Did you know I used to have panic attacks when I was little? Going out to the street... was a nightmare. Crossing an avenue was a whole tragedy. I couldn't go anywhere or come back home alone. I barely left the house. My mom got me a dog. It was a black Belgian shepherd, so beautiful. We bought a leash and I'd take him out for walks. But we'd always walk the same route, going around one block. Always. And one day, the dog ran away. And I went after him. Before I knew it, I was too far from home and I didn't know how to get back. But suddenly, I felt... that I was no longer afraid. How did I get home, you ask? The dog took me there. What does this have to do with breathing? The dog's name was Air. You're making that up. You are, aren't you? We're stopping. - What? - The truck is stopping. - Do you think we've arrived? - I don't know. Are they letting us out? - How long have we been in here? - We've stopped. - They must have a problem. - What's going on? They look nervous. - There's something they don't like. - We have to do something. Like what? Are you crazy? - You're putting us in danger. - We're already in danger. Who did that? I did that. Do that again and you will never forget this day. All right. All right! What about you, Alejandro? - What's that? - What horse are you betting on? I'm... What? Alejandro, are you feeling sick? The wine must have upset my stomach. Should I ask the waiter to bring you something? No, no, no. - Tonic water, anything? - No, it'll pass. Aren't you going to say something to your children? I think you owe them an explanation. FIVE MONTHS EARLIER What? I said I think you should talk to them about what happened today. Don't you? No, I don't. We're not going to talk about that now. So, when? - When this gets totally out of hand? - That's enough, please. They're old enough. They have the right to know they've been threatened. They have protection. - There was an explosion inside the house. - Enough. There's a man in the hospital with half his face burned. This was very hard for all of us. I'll double up security starting tomorrow. - Thanks, Dad. - Yes, Dad. This doesn't end here. You know that. They've broken into our house, they've opened our garage, they have our... Fuck! Stop pitting my kids against me! All right. We'll talk about it later. - Magda. - Dad, no! Sit down. I'm one of the most important businessmen in the country, and I've worked really hard to get there. I also have many enemies. That bomb was meant for me. That bomb nearly killed your son. Hold on. See that beauty? Alejandro, what the hell is wrong with you? There's a camera in there. They're spying on me. What do you mean "spying"? Who? Who's spying on you? Sir, something has happened. Yeah, I know something happened. I got Pedro on the line. Stop threatening me. Don't you lay a finger on my family. What do you want? Money? Then ask for it and quit fucking around! Get me Pedro. Pedro, you fucking idiot! I pay you to look after my family, and look at this mess. They came out of nowhere, boss. They were very organized. I think this is Velasco's doing. Exactly, boss. I thought the same thing. He's not going to stop until we're all dead. - The waiter. Where's the waiter? - What? He was here a moment ago! Sorry. Sorry. There. Get him! HIGHWAY 150 D, MEXICO Yes, sir. - Get over here. - Mom, no. - I said come here! - I'm coming. I'm coming. - What? - Come on, get out! - No. - Get off of her! Let her go! Mom! - Mom! Mom! - No. No! Mom! - Mom! - Out! Talk! What? Talk into the cell phone there. Your husband is listening. - Ale! - My love, where are the kids? - Are the kids okay? - They're in the car. In the car? - They put us in... - Shut up! - Let her go! - Mom! Mom! They're okay. The kids are okay. They're very scared, but they're okay. - What is it these people want? - I don't know. - Is it money? - I hope it's just money and nothing else. I swear nothing will happen to you. - Let her go, you bastard! - That's enough! GET BACK TO YOUR SEAT No, Andrés, please, don't leave. Don't leave. Call me when everything quiets down. I'm leaving. No, no, no. Let's close the deal now. You have financial problems and this will help you solve them. Let's close the deal. My patience is running out. Talk to my lawyer. Alejandro, are you going to tell me what the hell is going on? - I can't. - No, listen to me. - I'm going to get help, okay? - No, no, no. No one can help me. I need to be alone. How am I supposed to leave you alone? Luis, if everything turns out okay, I'll explain later. - If everything turns out okay, you say? - It's a private matter, Luis. Look, listen to me. I don't want anything to do with anything shady, you hear me? Don't piss me off, please. Alejandro, just go. I can't. - This is my skybox. - I know, but I can't leave this place. If everything turns out okay, I'll make it up to you. Get in the car. - I said get back in the car. - This isn't right. You can't treat us like this. You can't treat us like this! - Are you okay? - Mom. Mom, did they hurt you? - Did you talk to Dad? - I did. What did they do to you? I want you to know that you're the most important thing in my life. The only thing. And I would do anything to... - Did they say something bad? - Calm down. No. - Are they going to kill us? - No, sweetie, no. Don't worry. - Did they say they're going to kill us? - No, honey, no, no. Don't worry, Mommy. Dad is going to fix this, right? Don't worry. Dad is going to kill them. - Simón. - Yes. - I think I got rid of them. - Okay. You don't need to stay there any longer. Leave, quickly. I'll go get those two, all right? - How much do you need? - Just a hundred euros. I asked how much you need, not how much you want. I need a hundred. I'll give you fifty. Shit, I won't find a decent jacket for that price. I'm supposed to look nice at a job interview, aren't I? Fifty, Edu. And you'll show me the receipt. All right, 50. By the way, my sister called during lunch. - Magda? - Of course. She's my only sister. That's weird. She always calls at night. What did she want? She wanted to know if we'd be home after 6:00. - What for? - I don't know. She said someone would stop by on her behalf, something like that. - Stop by where? - By our place. Someone will stop by our place? Are you sure you got it right? Of course I got it right. I'm not an idiot. And she said it was important. What's this? 3,284,000 I mean... what is this, a joke? - What's up? - Look! - Holy shit. Does it say three million? - That's what it says. - Go inside and ask. - No, it's closed now. Yeah, but there must be a phone number or something. Obviously it's a mistake. That's what it is. Here. Maybe you can sue them. Yeah, right, sue them. Let's just go. No, don't take the card out! Hold on, hold on. It's evidence. I mean, it says you have three million and you don't even care. - On Tuesday. - At five o'clock, yes? Five? Well, I don't know. The time... - You told me. - Excuse me. Hello. Are you Nora Pellicer, Magda's mother? - And are you Eduardo, her brother? - Yes. What's going on? My name is Tobías. I'm a friend of your daughter. I'm here to deliver an important message from her. - She called you, didn't she? - Yeah, I spoke to her a while ago. Shall we go up and see it? 45 MINUTES AFTER THE KIDNAPPING - Let me out, you fucking bastard! - Mom, don't go. - Don't go alone. I'll go with you. Mom! - Stay here! Don't move. - Be careful, Mom. - All right, I'm not leaving! I'm not going anywhere! Put down your fucking weapon! Don't get out of the car until I tell you to. What is this? What is this sloppy mess? What's wrong? What's the problem? - My children. - Your children? They are perfectly fine. No, my children are suffering. Listen, Magda. I've been preparing for this day for months, and everything is turning out just fine. It's all going according to plan. - What about my husband? - Your husband is completely under control. You heard him yourself on the phone. - You're sure he's not suspecting anything? - Absolutely. Now calm down. Calm down, please. You're putting the whole operation at risk. I just don't want to see my children suffer. Better to see them suffer than to see them die, right? Sir, should we make the change? You pay, you decide. All right, kids. Come on, we're changing cars. - Isn't my mom coming with us? - Your mom's over there. Go on. Go on. - Mom! - Grab my purse! Paulina, her purse! Rubén, get out! Come here, honey. It's fine. Let's go, Rubén. - No, lady, you're not going. - What are you going to do to me? - Rubén! - Rubén, I can't. - They won't let me. - Let's go. - I have to stay here. - Let's go! Rubén, come here! Come on, Mom, come on! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. - Come on, honey. - It's okay. Get in. Quickly. All right, baby, this is the end of our trip. Now you're going to take a little nap, okay? And when you wake up, you have to deliver this envelope. Mom, what is this? Who is that man? How come you know him? That man is Simón. He used to be a cop and now he works independently. So what? He's protecting us. What do you mean protecting us? I made you go through all this. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. You made us? I had no choice. Rubén. Rubén, honey. There was nothing else I could do. This isn't a kidnapping? No, it's not a kidnapping. So, then, what is this? An escape. Rubén. Rubén, look at me. This is an escape. Read my lips. Who's escaping? We are? Yes. We're leaving the country. Why? Because Mexico isn't safe anymore. It's because of what happened at Christmas, isn't it? Dad said it wouldn't happen again. Dad can say whatever he wants, but we are threatened. Of course, like everyone else who has money! Money sometimes comes from sketchy places. What do you mean sketchy places? What are you trying to say? You know what I'm trying to say, Paulina. You're not stupid. Dad is involved in some dirty business, isn't he? Is that it? Your father has many enemies. People who want to hurt him. And the best way to hurt him is through you. Does he know? Yes, he does. And he agrees with you? Yes, he agrees. When do we get to talk to him? When we get to our destination. And where are we going? Far away. United States? Even farther. YOU'LL FIND RANSOM INSTRUCTIONS IN THE PAPER CLASSIFIED ADS PAGE ADULT SECTION Honestly, I swear I wouldn't make you go through this if I wasn't sure I didn't have a choice. I will explain absolutely everything when we meet. But right now, we can't waste any more time. Okay, I've wired a substantial amount of money to your account, Mom. Don't be scared. It's a lot of money. - There you have it. - Hush. I know that what I'm asking of you is unreasonable. It's a leap of faith. It's very important that you follow the instructions from the person who delivered this message to you. I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry for involving you in this mess. But I made a mistake 20 years ago. Yes, Mom, you warned me. I told her a hundred times. But I can't take it anymore. Above all, I don't want my children to pay for what their father is doing and I don't want you to pay for what I'm doing. Listen to me carefully. Alejandro is a very dangerous man. He has a lot of power. He will do anything. You need to disappear immediately. It's now or never. I love you. Pack whatever you consider essential because we're getting on a plane in a couple of hours. A plane? We have no time to waste. You heard your daughter. Yes, I heard her, but I'm not getting on a plane with a stranger. - Where is this plane taking us? - Not too far from here. Shit. This is the most bizarre thing that's ever happened to me. I'm sure it is. Shall we go? I'm going to call her. - She's not going to pick up the phone. - My daughter always answers my calls. Your daughter no longer has a phone number, - or a home, or an identity. - We inform you that the phone number you have dialed is currently not active. She needs your help, and so do your grandchildren. Will you turn your back on them? Go and see who it is. Go. Who is it? Don't open the door. Don't. In the bathroom. Go to the bathroom. Fuck off. Open up. It's me. - Where's the other guy? - Open up. Okay. Get a cab and go to the airport. Terminal four. - We'll rendezvous at the meeting point. - Yes. - Things got a little complicated. - Yes, I can see that. Go on. MEXICO CITY - Hello? - Pedro. How far are you from Ixtapaluca? - I'm 50 minutes away, boss. - All right. Go to the Calavera drive-in theater. - What are we looking for? - I don't know, idiot. The ransom instructions are there. - Understood. We're on our way. - My oldest kids are turning 18 tomorrow. If I'm not celebrating with them, you will be very sorry. To the Guest, please. May I sit here? As long as you cover your head. Wouldn't you cry more comfortably back there? I guarantee I can cry anywhere. I don't like seeing people cry. Neither do I. Your kids seem strong. Yes, they are. But they've always lived comfortably and... I don't know how they'll adapt to a normal life. For now, their lives are going to be far from normal. Right. We can't leave any trace, no matter how insignificant it may seem. Cell phones, Internet, all kinds of communication are going to be forbidden for a while. Is that clear? Alejandro is going to move heaven and earth to find us. All right, calm down. Calm down, please. We will hear from him soon. As soon as they find the envelope with the instructions. Are you okay? I'm feeling dizzy. Do you want me to stop? No, no, no. Keep driving. Here. Take me to a hospital. When are you going to tell them the truth? They think their father is in on this. I know. I can't tell them now. I'm exhausted. And I need to focus on running away without leaving any loose ends. So, what happens when they get to Spain and see their father isn't there? I don't know. Well, now you have a little while to think about it. How do you tell your children that their father is a killer? He even threatened to kill me. How do you tell them that? My kids are the most sacred thing in my life. Don't you touch them. If you ever speak to me like that in front of them again, I swear I will kill you. God, how is this possible? I haven't slept in six months, and now I'm dozing off. It's the orange juice. There was a sedative in it. What? Without my permission? Stop complaining. Sleep will do you good. Atta girl. When you feel fear for a long time... you just want the fear to end. It paralyzes us. But when we do what we fear most... then you can do anything.
