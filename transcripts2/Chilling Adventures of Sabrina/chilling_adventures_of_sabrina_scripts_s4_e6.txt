 Sabrina. Can you hear me? Are you okay? Send me a sign, anything. Spellman? Hey, it's cold. Come back to bed. Maybe Sabrina Morningstar is cold... wherever she is. Or worse. Hey. You have to just trust that she's okay...

 and give it time. Well, Ambrose, what do you think? Did we do it? Has the other cosmos stopped approaching? Well, by measurement alone, it appears as if the other cosmos is still coming at us. However, it wouldn't just simply vanish overnight. No. Most likely, it would slow down, then become inert, and then dissipate. If we're about to be completely obliterated, because of me, shouldn't we warn people? Until we know more, please do not say anything to anybody. 'Cause that would cause a mass panic. This isn't your fault. Are you kidding? It's 100% my fault.

 It was my father who released the eldritch terrors. That may be, but I'm certainly a magnet for them. Why else would they be constellating in Greendale? Lilith? Ooh! Hey, love. Huh, how are you doing in here? Brought you a little bit of breakfast. Little bit of a toad-in-the-hole. I'll tell you what, since Lucifer visited, Baby Adam, who has a tendency to be a bit fussy, doesn't he? He's been as quiet as a church mouse. Yes. Well, little Adam is an absolute angel. You need us, we're here, all right? Here is your breakfast, Agatha, some nice hot porridge. Hmm? ♪ Pease porridge, hot ♪ ♪ Pease porridge, cold ♪ ♪ Pease porridge in the pot Nine days old ♪ Poor Sister. Still lost after all these months. We'll get you back… somehow. Excuse me? What are you doing in our rehearsal space? We're setting up to practice. Sorry, but we booked this room. I thought we were the only band at Baxter High. The Stoned Philosophers reserved this room. So, how about you pack up that sad crap and beat it? - How about I beat your sad ass? - Whoa! Whoa! Theo! Guys, guys… there's a better way to settle this. Name it. And this Tobey kid's like, "Pack your sad crap." And then Theo's, like, this close to beating him down. And then Harvey challenged them to a Battle of the Bands. The Student Council can sponsor that, right, Brina? Uh, yeah, I think so, but... Excuse me. I couldn't help but hear you kids talking about having a Battle of the Bands. I just came across this the other day in the library archives. Time's never change. Well, that settles it. It's time to bring this tradition back. Ooh! Battle of the Bands. That'll be exciting. - Do you know what songs you're singing? - No. Nick and I aren't in the Fright Club. It's Harvey, Roz, and Theo. Is it an eldritch terror? Oh! Oh! Why, it's Vinegar Tom! But he's dead, isn't he? Pish-tush, who cares? Vinegar Tom's back. Marie, what is it? It is time. The thinning between the fabric of life and death is upon us. Marie, what are you saying? Is it an eldritch terror? It is. The lèmò are coming… les revenants… the resurrected dead. Oh crap! We're not even done with the Cosmic. Now the Returned? Sorry, Vinegar Tom is an eldritch terror? All of the Returned are, and they must be faced and fought on multiple battlefields. - Where do we go? - They come to you. And you must be careful as the dead return. They are not as they seem. They will not remember everything. They may not even know that they have perished. Do not upset them. The dead must be made to feel welcome. Or else… bad things will happen. And now, I must go. Go? Go where? The dead have an avatar, one I must face… and alone. Rise. Lespri, rise. Hello, old friend. It is good to see you, chérie. Liar. Tell me, which game shall we play this time? I believe an ancient game of Senet would be most fitting for the occasion. Son of a… Oh. Holy shit. Whoa! Greendale! We're back. Let's raise some hell. Harvey! What the hell are you doing? Where did you get this? I-I found it buried in a bunch of junk. Dad, I didn't know you played guitar. I don't. And can't you waste your time on something useful for once? Ladies, I hate to break it to you, but you're both flat. I'm not about to be humiliated by Fright Club, and frankly... You guys suck. Place hasn't changed much. Excuse me. We reserved this room. Who are you? We're Satanic Panic, and we'll be taking your instruments for practice. Over our dead bodies. Make it hurt, guys. We are playing Senet. You remember the rules of the game, hey, my friend? These pieces represent the souls of the dead. To win, we must move our pawns to the end of the board, to the afterlife, to peace. Or, if you lose, they shall never return to their graves… and the living and the dead shall suffer endlessly. Auntie? Auntie, I was... Shh. Is that... Is he really here? Edward. Edward. So sorry to interrupt you, but this is... Sabrina. I'm... A very promising student. Sabrina? My daughter's a Sabrina. A lovely name. I have so much to ask you, so much to tell you. I hardly know where to begin. How... That's enough, Sabrina. Let us leave the High Priest to his work. If you'll excuse us, Brother? Sabrina, Edward is one of the Returned. Same as Vinegar Tom. Wait, so he's an eldritch terror? A manifestation of the terror. For now, our job is to keep him comfortable. As Marie said, it would prove perilous to remind the dead of their passing. Like waking someone from a night terror. What matters is that he's back. We've been given a second chance, Sabrina. Isn't it marvelous? We Spellmans together again. Auntie, he wasn't at all how I imagined. Did he seem... normal to you? Edward was always focused on his work. Adam? Adam? Adam! Adam! Where are you? Adam? Where are you? Adam? Adam, please, forgive me. Forgive me! Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. ♪ The maid was in the garden Hanging up the clothes ♪ ♪ When down came a blackbird And pecked off her nose ♪ What are you playing at, Sister? Who are you? It's me, dummy, Dorcas. Oh. Do you wanna play poppets with me? Yes. But first, I wanna… get out of this dress. It's… sticky. Oh! Dr. Cee? Darling. Bit of news. Hilda, my love, there you are. Ah! Ooh! Okay. So now, don't panic, but there might be just a slight chance that the dead are coming back from the grave. I know. What? My mother came into the store an hour ago. And, Hilda… she died ten years ago. Come on. Come on. I want you to meet her. Come. - Oh. Is she... - Yeah, she's right through here. Right here. Is that her? Mother. Um, okay. Mother, I want you to meet my darling wife, Hilda. And, Hilda, I want you to meet... the other love of my life… - my mother. - Aw! It's very nice to meet you. Elaine, is it? - It's Mrs. Kosgrove, dear. - Oh. Looks like the Stoned Philosophers dropped out, but another band signed up. Wait. Wasn't Satanic Panic on that flyer Mrs. Curtis showed us? Who the hell are they? So, are you guys… the Fright Club? Uh, yeah. Are you guys Satanic Panic? In the flesh, dweeb. You look familiar. What's your name? Harvey… Kinkle. Well, say hello to your old man for us, Harvey Kinkle. Dad, who is Satanic Panic? Harvey. Were they a band? And were you in it? There were these kids at school. They were into heavy metal and looking for a place to practice. I told them they could use my garage, so they let me into their band. I was part of Satanic Panic. And then one night, I was alone in the garage when this stranger showed up. He said he was a talent scout, and he heard about Satanic Panic. Cool name for a band. Catchy. If your friends are half as good as you, I think Satanic Panic could be huge. Yeah? You think so? Oh, absolutely, but fame takes commitment and sacrifice. Human sacrifice, to be exact. Kill one of your classmates. A girl, preferably. A virgin, definitely. Just one dead teenager, and your meteoric rise to fame will begin immediately… at this upcoming Battle of the Bands. And I can remember thinking, it was like the Devil, the actual Devil, had come to Greendale. I think we should do this! Hell yeah, baby. Yeah. Forget it. You guys are nuts. I'm out. And I thought that was it. But then the week of the Battle of the Bands, this girl goes missing, the homecoming queen, Peggy Lou Simcox. And then she was found dead. Stabbed in the woods. I didn't know what to do. And maybe it was stupid, but I went to Peggy Lou's dad, and I said, "Maybe, just maybe, Satanic Panic had something to do with the death of Peggy Lou." What happened? The next day, Satanic Panic didn't show up to school. By lunch, everyone was saying that they had burned to death. Trapped in some woodshed where they had been practicing. And that Peggy Lou's dad had confessed. He'd done it. Locked them in. Burned them alive. Holy shit, Dad. Nice cup of tea. Hilda's a wonderful baker too. Well, it's... I find it very relaxing to bake. Calms me down when I'm tense. Your Sandra was a baker, too, wasn't she, Kenny? Oh, Mother. Who was Sandra? Sandra and I dated years ago. Nothing serious. - Not like Erica. - Oh! Or that tall one or the Irish one. None of them, not a one, could hold a candle to my Kenny. That's why I had to kill them all. You know, I think maybe it's time we all went to bed, Mother. Well, I've made the spare room up for you. Oh, don't bother yourself, dear. No, no. I'll stay up a bit longer. I'll read my book. Go on. I'll put myself to bed. Okay. Well, you know where we are. If you need us, just shout. Good night, Mother. Oh, good night, Mrs. Kosgrove. Good night. I don't know if I have ever seen you smile. I haven't, friend. Not since the Nazarene brought me back from the dead. "Arise, Lazarus," he said. And I became the Resurrected Man, haunted by the horrific memory of what I'd seen the four days that I was dead: the souls of the damned writhing in agony. But then... why do you bring them back? Because those are the seeds that I sow: pain… and suffering. Bad luck. A roll that favors the Returned. Father Spellman? Excuse me, but may I show you something? Where did you get that? My room. I look at it every day. I'm your daughter, but grown-up. And I go to two schools: Baxter High and the Academy. I'm co-president of my junior class. I ran on the platform of being a witch. You're not a witch. No, of course I am… and a cheerleader. My daughter is barely two months old. No. I'm your daughter. Diana. I must speak with Diana. She's not here, because… uh… because she passed on. What about me? You've been dead for 16 years. Almost 17. But by some miracle, or actually terror, we get this second chance to get to know each other. Why would I want to get to know you? You're not my daughter. Your father is a goat. What? You heard me. You're an abomination. Your whore of a mortal mother wanted a baby. She claimed I couldn't give one to her. And so, Diana made a deal with the Devil and copulated with Satan himself, the Dark Lord. Can you imagine? Her lying with that filthy barn animal? - I didn't want you. I never wanted you. - You don't know what you're saying. Please! Stop! I'm going to do what I should have done the moment you were born. Out! Right this second. ♪ Lizzie Borden took an ax ♪ ♪ Gave her mother 40 whacks ♪ ♪ Up in heaven, she will swing ♪ ♪ On the ga... ♪ Agatha. - Hmm? - Did you do that to me? What? Did you stab me? A lot? I remember that we were playing. No. No, I think you killed me… for real.

Go and have a nice cup of tea. Oh, Mrs. Kosgrove? You okay? Mother Kosgrove. I'm not your mother. - No. - Don't ever call me Mother. - Sorry. - You're a witch, aren't you, dear? - Did Kenny tell you that? - Oh, he didn't need to. A mother knows things about the whores her son sniffs out. You're witches, all of you. That's hurting my wrist a little bit. Trying to steal my little boy. You are not worthy of my son. Wayward. Wicked. Godless. Well, at least I'm still alive, you walking cadaver. What? Oops. Oh! Mrs. Kosgrove! Mrs… What is going on? Hilda! - Mother! - Kenny! - Dr. Cee, help. - Help me. Stop her! He's settled now. Resting. Auntie, it was awful. He said horrible things to me... …including that… he wasn't my father. Edward said that? And the terrible thing is… he's right. I was just a baby when he died. He knew me... two months? Why should he care about me? Why should I care about him? Oh, now bloody what? Kenny, let me out! Kenny, listen to your mother! Okay, I just got off with Zelda. And she did say we've just gotta keep her trapped, and try not to antagonize her, and hope that Mambo Marie beats these eldritch terrors. She's a filthy, dirty slut! Kenny! Yeah, now, I'd… I'd really like her to be dead again, I think. Why have you summoned me here, Lilith? Firstly, let me ask you: Do you hear that? The sound of a baby crying? I hear nothing of the sort. I'm sorry Lucifer condemned you to a living death. I would have loved to have killed you myself. I wish he had killed me. And I want to end it, Caliban… presently and permanently. But I need your help… to do it. Gladly. But… neither of us can break Lucifer's malediction. That's true. The only weapon that can kill someone cursed with immortality is the Spear of Longinus, the spear that pierced the Nazarene's side when he was crucified. The Centurion of Golgotha is in Hell, guarding that spear. Go to him. Retrieve it for me, please. And I'll end my misery. Consider it done. So, while I was dealing with my dead father, you guys were being challenged by a satanic rock band from Hell? What if we all just dropped out of the Battle of the Bands? Guys, we don't have to drop out. Mrs. Meeks just told me that they found the slaughtered bodies of the Stoned Philosophers in a dumpster behind the school. They canceled Battle of the Bands. Oh my God! At least we're off the hook. You wish, Kinkle. The Battle of the Bands is still happening. We're not getting cheated again. And we've got the perfect venue. Right in front of the gates of Hell. Our judges will be the living and the dead. Forget it, Trash. We're out. No, you're not. 'Cause we've got your old man. And when you lose the Battle of the Bands, we go on to fame and fortune, and your old man takes our place in Hell for being such a damn snitch. Dad? Dad, are you here? Harvey. They took him. They took my dad. We're not giving up, Harvey. We're not gonna lose the Battle of the Bands either. Theo, we can't compete with Satanic Panic as a metal band. Then we won't. We'll play to our strengths. I think I have the perfect song. But we need another singer. Are you thinking Robin? I wasn't gonna say anything, but… but I kind of miss him. In that case, Sabrina, do you… know any spells for summoning hobgoblins from the forest? That's like asking did Shakespeare write Midsummer Night's Dream. Of course I do. In the meantime, Harvey, didn't you say Satanic Panic was offered a deal by Lucifer back in the day? My dad did, yeah. Okay. Let me see what I can find out from my dad. - What do you know about Satanic Panic? - I was their manager. From what I recall, they let me down by burning to death, so I dragged them to Hell for killing that poor, sweet girl, Peggy Lou Simcox. Well, they're back in Greendale, causing trouble. Yes, yes, I know. Thanks to your latest eldritch terror, the Returned, Hell's like a sieve. Damned have been slipping through left and right. I'm on it. So, you'll reclaim Satanic Panic? No, not them. I'll let them stay. Cause a bit of havoc. Have a bit of fun. Still a fan of their music. You know, for the Prince of Lies, you're a terrible liar. You can't drag them back, can you? - Don't be ridiculous. - They're part of the Returned. Till their champion is beaten, you can't do anything about them. On the contrary, I'm managing them again. Satanic Panic kidnapped Harvey's dad, who didn't do anything wrong. Yes, he did. He snitched, which I despise. Well, can you at least get them to release Mr. Kinkle? Why would I do that? Because… because I'm your daughter, and I'm asking you. Daughter? You're not my daughter. I won't help you. In fact, if Satanic Panic wins, I'm going to give them a bonus, the ability to conjure and inflict hellfire. Why would you do that? So they can burn down Greendale the way they themselves were burned down in their prime. Now begone from my sight. Happy death day, Lilith. Hecate, give me the strength to do what must be done. Lilith! What are you doing? An atonement. Sister Zelda, I am haunted by the dead. Oh, as are we all. I have one of the Returned locked in my office. Even now, Mambo Marie is squaring off against the terrors' undead ally, Lazarus. Lazarus? The Resurrected Man is here, in Greendale? He's behind all of this. And until Marie defeats him, the dead will keep coming back. Do you know where the Resurrected Man is? First of all, and in no way am I trying to knock the Fright Club as a band, but competing against a hell-bound heavy metal group like Satanic Panic... They would be lambs to the slaughter. Unfortunately, yes. But we can fight hellfire with hellfire. But we'd have to deliver a real showstopper. Lucifer himself gave me the idea. Satanic Panic wants revenge on the town of Greendale for how they burned. Well, you know who else probably wants revenge? Peggy Lou Simcox. Exactly. But we need to move fast. ♪ I got an angel on my mind... ♪ Where did all these kids come from? Some of them don't even look alive. Oh my God. There's my dad. - We gotta get him out. - We will. Harvey, we're gonna crush our song. But remember Sabrina's plan. No one is dragging your dad to Hell. I promise. Are you having second thoughts about agreeing to this? No, no, no. Definitely not. Um… I mean, even if that doesn't mean that we're… getting back together again. Hey, I'm always willing to help you, Theo. Ha! Who's ready to burn the house down? Now I know all you twisted little freaks are here for the Battle of the Bands. So let's get this party started. Shall we? First up, a personal favorite of mine. They're bad to the bone. They are Satanic Panic! ♪ Very young, getting kicks ♪ ♪ Cruisin' around 56 ♪ ♪ They don't know the acid rain ♪ ♪ Is coming down to make them insane ♪ ♪ Do you wanna party? ♪ ♪ It's party time ♪ ♪ Uh... ♪ ♪ It's party time ♪ ♪ It's party time ♪ Uh... hey. We're the Fright Club. Um... We're from Baxter High. Go on. You can do it. We're hoping you go on a little trip with us.

But I think it's clear, the winner is... The Battle's not over, Lucifer. - Ooh! - You never give up, do you? Never. Very well. We have one final band, a latecomer. I give you... We are the Dark Mothers. So get ready to lose your shit! ♪ She's got a smile that it seems to me ♪ ♪ Reminds me of childhood memories ♪ ♪ Where everything was As fresh as the bright blue sky ♪ ♪ Now and then when I see her face She takes me away to that special place ♪ ♪ And if I stare too long I'd probably break down and cry ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet child o' mine ♪ ♪ Ooh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine ♪ Excuse me. - You're in the middle of a game. - Yes. And I am winning. So why this interruption? I seek a boon from you. Lazarus, the Resurrected Man, my… my baby died, you see. Can you bring him back, please? If there is no semblance of a body, then I'm afraid I cannot help you. How unfortunate. My turn. If I roll a three or higher, I win, and the living and the dead… shall forevermore be entwined and suffer, feeding the Void as it approaches. No! Yes. I win. Die, you bastard! How… how is this possible? Lazarus is immortal. The Spear of Longinus helped kill the Nazarene, who resurrected Lazarus. If it could kill the Nazarene, it could kill one of his last remaining miracles. Thank you, Lilith. I didn't do it for you. Nevertheless, today, life and death will triumph over the Returned. And you… you will receive… not the boon you sought, but a boon. ♪ She's got eyes of the bluest skies As if they thought of rain ♪ ♪ I'd hate to look into those eyes ♪ ♪ And see an ounce of pain ♪ ♪ Her hair reminds me Of a warm, safe place ♪ ♪ Where as a child I'd hide ♪ ♪ And pray for the thunder and the rain ♪ ♪ To quietly pass me by ♪ ♪ Oh, whoa, whoa, sweet child o' mine ♪ ♪ Oh, whoa, whoa, sweet love of mine ♪ ♪ Where do we go now?

All right. Settle down. That was all very... We are the Dark Mothers, and we just straight up snatched this Battle of the Bands. So let me hear it! Dark Mothers! Dark Mothers! Dark Mothers! Well sung, False Daughter. Go to Hell, False Father. I think I will. Dad! Dad. Dad! Dad, are you okay? Harvey, you were awesome. So you beat the Resurrected Man, then? Lilith was crucial to our victory. She's been a busy girl. And now? Now, I'm afraid that when I lead the dead back to the graves, I must go and stay with them. Stay? But, Marie, that's absurd. Why would you stay with them? I am not as I appear. Mambo Michelle Marie Le Fleur is not my true name. Who or what are you then, exactly? I am… Baron Samedi, a powerful Haitian loa, the almighty father of the Gede loa, the spirits of death and rebirth. All this time? Yes. But now that the great confusion between life and death has been resolved, it is time for me to return to the underworld. But when it is your turn to leave this life and enter the next, I will be there. Or, if you shall need me before that, shake this, and I will hear it, and I will come to you. Thank you. But I doubt that I'll want any special favors from you, Baron Samedi… or whatever your name is. Zelda. Dorcas. This is our friend, Mambo Marie. She's going to take you to a place where… a better place for you than this one. I don't wanna go, Prudence. I just got back. I know. I know. I don't wanna be dead. There is no such thing as dead, Sister. We will be reunited again soon. I promise. Come with me, chérie. Prudence? Why am I in a straitjacket? What happened? Agatha? What? Agatha, is… is it you? Dorcas was here? She said the strangest thing, that she forgives me. But for what? I will tell you. But first, let me undo your binding, Sister. - What did I… What did I do? - No, it's okay. - For what? - It's okay. - For what? - It's okay. It's okay. Come here. It's okay. So, when my dad wakes up, he won't remember anything? No. It'll be like he had a dream. Thanks, dude. Thanks for what you guys did at the Battle of the Bands. Well, uh, I should probably get back to the woods. Robin… I got scared, and I sent you away. It's okay. I know it's not fair… of me to ask you to stay… but will you? Theo… that's all I ever wanted. Mama. Mama. Adam? Could it be? May the soles of your feet suffer no more. Return to the ground from which you came, to rest in Ginen. You didn't get to say goodbye to your father, Sabrina. He wasn't my father. Not really.
