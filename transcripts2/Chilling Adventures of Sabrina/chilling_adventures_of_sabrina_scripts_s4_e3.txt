 Agatha, Mary, Judas, Judith, look sharp. I'm Faustus Blackwood, and you... you're the Weird One. We know who you are, Blackwood. We are risen from the fathomless depths. You will serve us as we seek a new host of warm, wet, red flesh. We are merely borrowing this suit of drowned meat. It is dead. Then you require a powerful body.

 I offer you mine. I have tasted eldritch flesh. Merge with me... Too weak. Too weak. We seek the one that has bested two of our eldritch kin, the witch girl named Sabrina Spellman. She is strong. You are not. It is her body we seek for our own. With her, we will colonize the Earth. In that case, O Weird One, if I may, you'll require a Trojan horse. All right, Salem. Now, according to the coroner's report, this luckless gentleman...

 drowned in Sweetwater River. However, the lividity marks pooled in his upper chest... ...indicate that there's a great deal of salt water in his lungs. Spellman Sisters' Mortuary. How can I help you? Yes, so sorry for your loss. Uh, yes. Y-yes, of course. And how do you spell that? Again, my condolences. May he be sweet and sensitive, like Harvey. But powerful, with a dash of danger, like Nick. May you be the best of both Nick and Harvey. Love, come to me. So mote it be. He's growing. That's progress. At this rate, I will have the perfect boyfriend before the weekend. Are you ready for your big presentation to the coven, Ambrose? Well, with the eldritch terrors gathering, it is imperative that we be well informed if we are to stand the slightest chance of survival. So I'm hoping to be. Where is Hilda? Oh, you know, she got married, and she doesn't live here anymore. Selfish to the last. Cerberus Books and Spirits. How may I assist you? By coming home at once. This new arrangement doesn't work for me, Sister. I need you here. Calm down. What happened? You okay? I can't find my morning papers, there's no coffee, and I don't know where my lighter is. I coordinated everything with Sabrina and Ambrose, so it should all be there. I have to go. It's been a very nice chat though. And I'll see you at Ambrose's lecture. Love you, bye. Hildegard! The eldritch terrors... are ancient entities that pre-date recorded time and space. They existed before our primitive concepts of good and of evil. They are inhuman. They are unkillable. They are world-destroying. Now for a, uh, spot of good news. Thanks to our mortal friends, Harvey Kinkle and Rosalind Walker, we have been given prophetic clues as to the terrors yet to come. Prudence. Now... we've already encountered the Dark and the Uninvited. But we believe that there are six more terrors yet to come, culminating with the arrival of the Void. And with it, the end of all things: of sanity, of reality, of the universe itself. We suspect the villain Faustus Blackwood had a direct hand in unleashing the terrors... and could possibly be serving them. So, if he is spotted anywhere, kill him immediately... and without mercy. We believe the next terror... to come will be the Weird, though we have no idea when it will manifest, in what form, or where. - However... - What can we do to prepare? That is a good question, Melvin. Uh... We can... We can remain vigilant... and report any strange disturbances or manifestations to either Prudence or myself. Sounds like there isn't a lot we can do. You're right. We have never faced a peril such as this. Why are they coming to Greendale? Do we know? I don't have an answer for that question, Nicholas. Can the Dark Mother protect us from the terrors? Some. But unfortunately, when the time comes, we will have to protect ourselves. Thank you all. Excusez-moi, but how exactly did you see the images in those drawings? - I have a sixth sense. - Ah. My nana calls it the cunning. It helps me see things that others can't. - Uh-huh. - So... Roz, we should go. We already missed first period. Sorry, we gotta get to class. Bi-biology. But of course, chérie. This week we will be focusing on invertebrates. Specifically on mollusks. Cephalopod mollusks consist of such creatures as octopi, squid, and cuttlefish. Yes? Can I help you? My name's Lucas Hunt. I transferred here from Innsmouth High to be on Baxter's swim team. Mrs. Meeks said I'm in this biology class. Yes, well, take a seat, Mr. Hunt. We are in the middle of discussing invertebrates. Oh, yeah, I heard. Uh, weirdly enough, I've actually held a live octopus in my hands once. Oh! Is, uh... Is this seat taken? No. Where'd you hold a live octopus? The Atlantic Ocean. - I was scuba diving. It was awesome. - Cool. Mr. Hunt, you and Sabrina can be partners for our upcoming squid dissection. Now... marine biologists believe that octopus intelligence is the closest thing on this planet to extraterrestrial intelligence. Oh, hey, uh, can I get your digits? Do you mean my phone number? Since we're lab partners, and so maybe I can ask you to dinner... so you can give me the lay of the land of Baxter. Yeah, yeah, you can have my number, but I am pretty busy with my after-school job these days. Oh cool. Where do you work? Oh, uh, my family runs a funeral home. Excellent. Like in Six Feet Under. Yeah, exactly like that. Sabrina. Girl. Hey. Why didn't you say yes to dinner? That Lucas guy is a dreamboat. I don't wanna be dating a different guy every night. Isn't that the fun of being single? I just wanna meet someone who I can connect with on a deep, meaningful level, Mr. Right. Brina, the universe has sent you a cute, seemingly straight, seemingly single boy who's on the swim team. What if he's Mr. Right? - You. - I know. I'm in the kitchen, Harvey. Can I help you? I hope so. I am Mambo Marie. I know who you are. Why are you here in my house? I came to tell you that you are no cunning woman, as you believe. You, chérie, are a Weird woman... ...a witch. That's... That's not possible. It is. Your mèt tèt did not tell you the whole truth about yourself. My what? Your guardian spirit. I think you call her Nana. N'est-ce pas? It is better if she explains it to you herself. What the voodoo queen says is true. We Walker women were witches, but we couldn't use that word. We were, after all, God-fearing Christian women, and witches... witches danced with the Devil and were burned at the stake. So, to protect ourselves from that same fate, we called ourselves cunning women. Why are you telling me this now? Because... it is as Ambrose says, we are at war with the eldritch terrors. We need ton pouvoir, your power. So, you will come see me at the Academy, eh? That's Harvey. He can't find... you here. So, uh, what made you change your mind? Hmm? - About having dinner with me. - Oh. Truthfully, it was... it my friend Roz. She encouraged me to say yes. I hope it didn't take too much encouraging. No, no, no. It's just... I've just been working through some stuff. Wanna talk about it? I guess I've been feeling unmoored lately... in my life. Like I'm drifting through it without a map, and that's weird for me. So much so that I find myself wondering where I fit in the grand scheme of things, the universe. I've just been having this free-floating anxiety, like... I don't know who I really am anymore. Pfft. I don't know. Sixteen going on 17 a little too young to be having an existential crisis? I had one when I was eight. You know what saved me? Let me guess. Swimming? Yeah. Yeah. No. I, um... when I'm underwater, everything goes quiet, and I feel this weird kind of... peace. I am glad your friend convinced you to do this, Sabrina. Maybe we can do it again? - Thank you for listening, Lucas. - Yeah. - See you in class tomorrow? - Uh, yes. Tomorrow, for our big dissection. See ya. What did you think of the swim meet, Sabrina? You won the gold medal. The medal has to be gold. The eldritch ones demand it. That makes sense. I am the Weird, and you are the first. Then, with your power, we will consume and subsume all life. You swam like a fish. I'm not a fish. No, you're a boy... a cute boy... who smells like chlorine. Can I kiss you? Sure. But one thing you should know... ...I'm not a boy either. How does the throne feel, Prince? As though it was made for me. Enjoy it while the Dark Lord and his daughter are away touring the Nine Circles. Remember, Prince, there is much standing between you and the royal seat. Do you think me a fool, Asmodeus? I know. And I, Caliban, will be King of Hell. And I will not have my status threatened by Lilith and Lucifer's bastard. So that the crown and the throne be won, let mother and son be undone. Oh. Something's wrong. Minion. Minion, where's my... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my baby! Minion! Yes, Your Wickedness. My body's not ready. It can't handle this. Listen to me. Listen to me closely. I'll be ripped apart if we don't get this baby out of me right now. And for that, I'll need some help, so you need to take me to the mortal realm as quickly as possible before my body is... Lilith? What's this about? Please, Sister Zelda, help me. My baby is coming. Baby? What baby? Lucifer's, but it's coming too soon. Please help me! Prudence, call Hilda and gather all the witches in the Academy. We'll need our collective strength to save Lilith. Lilith, breathe. Deep breaths. Deep breaths, my love. Please, I can't! You must do it, Lilith. You must breathe, and you must push. This baby is tearing me apart! Don't fight it! That is the way of men! We, your sisters, are here for you. We will give you strength. We will share your pain. Dark Mother, Hecate, we call upon you. Come to us! Make Lilith's pain our pain so she may push. Push! Push! - Push! - Breathe! - Push! - Breathe. Push! That's it! Share it! Share the pain! Share it. Share it. Push! Share it! Share it! Push! It's coming! Zelda, it's coming. I see him, your son. He's... He's beautiful. Shh. He's perfect. Perfect little devil. Thank you, Sister. Thank our Dark Mother. It was she who blessed this birth, as she blesses all births. We'll make the first incision right down the mantle of the squid. - Oh. - No, uh, please, ladies first. Okay. Hey, you, uh... Are... are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. It was just a... just a cramp. Sabrina? Miss Spellman, uh, what is it? It's nothing. I'm... totally fine. Let's see what the school nurse has to say about that. No, no, no, no. I just need to go home and lie down. Can you get somebody to pick you up, at least? - Well, I can drive her. - I can driver her. Lucas can take me. Are you sure you shouldn't lie down or go see a doctor? No, no, no. I'm 100 percent fine. Seriously, I... I don't know what that was. I think I was maybe dehydrated or something. Okay, cool. Cool. Well, um, I have swim practice, but I feel bad leaving you home alone. Well, I'm not alone. My cousin's downstairs in the embalming room, but... maybe you shouldn't leave me alone... just yet. ♪ You done a bad thing again ♪ ♪ You done a bad thing again... ♪ What? What's wrong? Nothing, you're just an aggressive kisser is all. Too aggressive? No. What? What is it? Uh, it's just, um... I don't know how to say this, but your tongue feels, like, really, really weird. It's, like, super hard and rough. What's wrong with my tongue? Can I take a look at it? No, yeah. No, there is something, like, really, really wrong with your tongue. You should, uh, definitely go to a doctor or a hospital, and I'm gonna go to swim practice, so... How very peculiar. What is? Our dead friend over there... also has a tongue lined with suckers... and ink sacs in his palms. Moreover, he has three hearts, ammonia for blood, and his bones have begun to soften. What does that all mean? The short of it is that he was turning into a squid-human hybrid. And now I am dreadfully concerned that you yourself, Cousin, are... turning into a hybrid as well. What? How? Do you think this is some kind of spell? A curse? A curse? It transferred from him to you? Possibly, but not likely. No. Given what's happening to your physiology, the most likely scenario is his body was the former host... and your body is the current host. Host to what? Now, Cousin, don't panic, but... I think you may have fallen prey to the third eldritch terror, the Weird. What? How? Based on one of Harvey Kinkle's drawings and the Weird literature of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, I believe that the Weird is a parasitic entity resembling Mollusca Cephalopoda Octopoda. Octopoda? The parasite is an octopus, and it's inside me? Probably snuck in using his corpse as a Trojan horse. Hiding inside him, transforming him, and now... Now it's inside me doing the same thing. Turning you into the perfect host with which to attack the Earth. If it's already inside me, you have to get it out. You have to get it out right now. This is Sweeney's butcher paper. It will allow me to take a snapshot of your insides. Somewhat like a CAT scan. Now up you get. Now close your eyes, or you'll go blind. Up you get. Let's see what we've got. What the unholy Hell is that? Is that... That is the Weird hiding amongst your intestines. - Get it out of me. - I'm not a surgeon, but the aunties... The aunties are not surgeons either, Ambrose. If I am going under anyone's knife, it's yours. Now please, get this thing out of me before I start growing two more hearts, and my blood turns to ammonia. Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. But you won't be going under my knife. All right. Here we go. Do you see it? Is it in there? I see many vital organs, but no alien organism. Perhaps... Weird presence confirmed. Cousin, I have my eyes on it. Ah, it's retreating. - Can you reach in and grab it? - Not without killing you. Dark Mother, it's sliding in my chest. Is it trying to kill me? No, it does not want that, but my wand will kill you if I do anything more invasive. We have to find another way. Will you get me another glass of water, Ambrose? I'm dying of thirst. Water. Of course. Sabrina, whatever else it is, the Weird is a cephalopodic terror. It cannot live without water. So to purge you of this parasitic entity, let us make you an inhospitable host. Yes, please, immediately. - But how? - If we drain the water from your body, the Weird should leave your body on its own accord, seeking a more hydrated host. Luckily, there's a river witch amongst our ranks who can manipulate water. I understand why Sycorax is here, Nick, but why are you? Because every other witch in the coven is swooning over Lilith's baby, and I can't even deal. Oh. I'm worried about you, Spellman. That's why I came. As well you should be. While Sycorax... can drain the water from out of your body, it's not without its risks. If you lose too much too quickly, your organs could shut down, and you could die of dehydration. Not on my watch, she won't. Sycorax, do your worst. Get this thing out of me. Spirit of Naides, this charge be sick, drain this witch of water quick. - Spirit of Naides, this charge be sick... - You okay? - ...drain this witch of water quick. - Keep going. Don't stop. Ambrose, it isn't working. Don't lose your nerve now, Nicholas. Steady. Spirit of Naides, this charge be sick, drain this witch of water quick. - Sycorax, that's enough. - It's not out yet. Don't stop. Spirit of Naides, this charge be sick, drain this witch of water quick. - Spirit of Naides, this charge be sick... - Sabrina? ...drain this witch of water quick. Sabrina. Okay. Come on. Okay? Nicholas, bucket, bucket! Oh! What an ugly little bugger! That right there, Sycorax, is what an eldritch terror looks like. How do you feel? Thirsty. - Tongue check. - Hmm? Let me see your tongue. As cute and pink as ever. How's the Weird? - Uh, dead, it seems. - Really? That was easy. Hardly. We got lucky. Attacking the Weird's one weakness when it was at its most vulnerable before it could fully bond with Sabrina, that could have been disastrous. Her powers under the control of one of those eldritch entities. What's next? Do we burn it now or... No, not until I've dissected its carcass and discovered its secrets. Meantime, we should inform the aunties of what's transpired here. What word of Lilith? Why have you not brought me her head yet? My Lord, it appears Lilith has fled to Greendale and... given birth under the protection of the witches there. Impossible. Our spell was meant to explode her innards. We will make this right. Oh, you'd better. Go to Greendale under a friendly guise and bring me that cursed brat so that I may throw it into the fiery pit myself. Do it. Now! Do I know you? Well, yeah. I'm Roz, Sabrina's friend. We've met, like, five or six times. We went after the pagans. You handed me a sword. Hmm. Sorry. I don't, um, remember. Ah, there is no need to be rude, chérie. Rosalind is a witch with a great pouvoir within her, eh? One that we will need to face these terrors that are coming. No, she's mortal. Isn't she? Oh. Well, then, perhaps we should test her. Come, come. After you. Begin. The High Priestess. Six of Cups. The next two are Seven of Pentacles and the Lovers. Then Justice. The Hermit. The Empress. But how can this be if you're a mortal? Rosalind is a seer, chérie. W-wait, something's happening. Kings from Hell... are coming... for a baby. Does that make sense? Come. Does that make sense? The Kings of Hell are here? At the gates, asking to see you to pay tribute to your baby. "Pay tribute"? They are here for one reason and one reason only, to kill my baby. The baby you just delivered, Zelda Spellman. Very well. Let's give them the welcome they deserve. State your business, Kings. Word has reached the Infernal Palace that a babe was born of Lucifer's concubine, Lilith. We come bearing gifts. No one here wants your gifts. Now go. Blasphemy. We come at the Dark Lord's behest. Nevertheless, you are not welcome here. We will not leave without the babe. Then we have a problem. You witches dare insult your Dark Lord? And what is to stop us from killing your pathetic coven and taking the babe? We no longer worship the Dark Lord. And Lilith and her babe are under our Dark Mother's protection, as is this coven. Would you like to see what that feels like? Our Dark Mother's power? We can show you. Sisters. To the womb, one day, we all return as from the womb we came. But until these kings at long last learn, give them all our Mother's pain. Well... Lucifer was bound to find out sooner or later. Yeah. It can't be helped. And what about... What do we do with what's-his-name, Asmodeus? Drag him behind the church. Leave him to the crows. Asmodeus is dead. They ripped him apart with the pain of childbirth. But the witches are without the Dark Lord's gifts. They now worship Hecate. And where is Lilith? They gave that whore and Lucifer's bastard sanctuary. They mean war. Then they shall have it. Lilith? Oh! Sorry to disturb you and the little thing. Um, we just wanted to let you know... Don't worry about the Kings of Hell. One is dead. The other one is probably dead. Shh. Um, the... the coven have decided that you can stay at the Academy here if you need. But what of the Dark Lord's wrath? We've suffered his wrath before. We'll manage. Will you accept our hospitality or not? Adam and I accept. Thank you. - What a little... - Ah-ah! Did you hear that, little Adam? We're gonna be safe here. Safe as can be. Ow! Ah! You are so bad. Hi. Don't panic. I just wanted you to know I'm fine. Everything's fine. See? Ah. Okay, amazing, but what the hell was that? The doctor said it was an intense allergic reaction to... calamari. I'm allergic to peanuts. They almost killed me once. - Mm. - Yeah. Still lab partners? Absolutely. There is no one I would rather dissect a squid with than you. Hmm. Do you see our scalpel anywhere? Sabrina, what's going on? You will bear witness. Why is everyone... Sabrina? We are the Weird. We are older than the stars. We are older than time. We were born in the first ocean. All life began with us, and all life will return to us. You will all be assimilated. You will all become our slaves. In the Dark Wet, we shared one consciousness. We will share it again. First, this host. With her power, we will assimilate this school, then this town, then this continent, then this world. We were wrong. I was wrong. It fooled us. You will become a part of us. Then we will be nourishment for the Void. That is our role. That is our function, to absorb and to be absorbed. But first, kill yourselves as tributes to my eldritch brothers and sisters. What? Cousin, you have to tell them to stop! You can't do this. You must fight this. You are stronger than the Weird. I know you are. We are the Weird. You will all succumb. You will all be colonized. Fine. Can you please tell me what the hell is going on? Hapless mortal, this is but a dream. Uh... you are all asleep, and you will drop your scalpels... and then you will wake up as if from a daymare. But first... we, Cousin, are getting out of here. Who are you? We are the Weird. At the beginning of all things, we were one in the water. At the end of all things, we shall be one in the water again. We are one. We think as one. We feel as one. No, I'm not you. I'm Sabrina Spellman. We are the Weird. Why do you fight us? Because I don't want you inside me. We are inside of each other. Why me? We chose you because you were the strongest and the weakest, the most vulnerable. You were an empty vessel waiting to be filled. And now we have filled you. - What happened? - Cousin? - How'd I get back home? - I knocked you out using a sleeping spell. You were being puppeteered by the Weird, I'm afraid. How is that possible? You saw it come out of me yourself. I did, yes. But, um, while you were asleep, I did another scan of your body, and look what has attached itself to your cerebellum. But it was dead. How did it get back inside me? My best guess is that it never left. When we drained the water out of your body, its physical form died. That's what you coughed up. But I suspect that its consciousness stayed behind. Ambrose, what are you saying? I believe that the Weird's consciousness has merged with your own. Oh no. We must make your brain a toxic, inhospitable environment for it so that its self-preservation instincts kick in, and it flees your body, seeking a more hospitable host. Well, I'm glad we have a plan, but how exactly are we going to do that? The rot witch, Pesta, is going to infect your brain with every disease known to human and witchkind. You're gonna rot my mind? To put it bluntly, yes. But this is also a battle of the wills. Yours against the Weird's. So whilst Pesta does her thing, you must fixate on a mantra, something that is unique to you, something that is yours and yours alone, so that its phantom tentacles have nothing to hold onto. - Do you understand? - Yeah, yeah. Let's get this thing out of me... and fast. Is that octopus... The perfect host body for the Weird's soul, don't you think? Hmm. And you're sure about your choice of mantra? Yes, Nick. I've had these words in my head for as long as I can remember. All right. Pesta, Sabrina... let's begin. ♪ I am 16 going on 17 ♪ ♪ I know that I'm naive ♪ ♪ Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet ♪ And, and, and... ♪ Sabrina. Come on. Stay strong.

I've had a really weird couple of days, and I wanna tell you about it... but I don't want you to freak out. Has anybody seen Lucas? I am afraid Mr. Hunt is no longer with us. And it is my understanding that he has transferred to Riverdale High. Probably for the best. You seem to be... all clear. When the Weird and I were attached, it said I was empty, that I was a vessel waiting to be filled. Hmm. What a miserable mollusk. In a way, it was right. I have been feeling empty and lost. But I've been trying to fill myself with the wrong thing. With what? Boys. I think I need to be alone for a little while. I need to figure out who I am on my own. ♪ Something strange in the night ♪ ♪ What a cruel game, an awful sight ♪ ♪ Just lay me down for sacrifice ♪ ♪ Something strange in the night ♪ Welcome to the Observatory.

I started to tell him, but I couldn't. - He'd worry and... - Some things are best kept secret. I understand. What now? We will take shifts while maintaining a constant psychic link. The eldritch terrors could attack at any moment, so we will tune ourselves to the realms' energies, and when there's a significant disruption, we will sense it and get ahead of the danger. I think this is why you were blessed with a gift of sight so long ago, Rosalind, to be here with us, in this room, at this moment, the three of us. The new Weird Sisters. What of the Weird, Father? Well, since we have retained independent thought, Agatha, it can only mean one thing. The Weird One's assimilation of Greendale failed. Which of the eldritch terrors comes next, Father Blackwood? My favorite... the Perverse. But this time, the eldritch terror shall serve... Blackwood. ♪ Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah ♪ OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
