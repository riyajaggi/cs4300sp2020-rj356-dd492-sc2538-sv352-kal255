 [theme music playing] [bats fluttering] [thunder crashes] [crows cawing] [lightning sizzles] [bats screeching] [knocking on door] Hi. I was just checking in to see how you and your dad were doing. He's back. - Who's back? - Tommy.

 He survived. Somehow, he dug himself out of the mines. And now, he's back. - That's amazing. - [chuckles softly] [Sabrina] Oh. Is he... - How is he? - Great. Doc Phibes checked him out. - Harvey, I'm so... happy and relieved. - [Harvey sighs] Me, too. I mean, I'll be even more so when the shock wears off in a couple days. - Shock? - Yeah. The collapse was a trauma, and then being trapped down there, but it's typical, Doc Phibes says. He should be back to his old self, eating and talking in no time. He's not talking?

 [creaking] Is that him? Can I see him? Maybe not tonight. Doc said he should rest for a bit. Yeah. But, Sabrina... he's back, my brother is back. What do you think of my new duds, Aunt Hilda? - Aww! - For my first day at the academy tomorrow, I thought I'd go for a little Carnaby Street cool. - Too much? - [stammers] Definitely not, no. You never get a second shot at a first impression. Okay. So the stew's nearly ready. Will you lay the table and round everyone up? Yeah. Uh, Sabrina went to Harvey's, and... Auntie Zee's been gone for ages. She has? That's odd. Where did she go, I wonder? Um-mm. [Zelda] If I'd known this style of Satanic Confession was an option for Church of Night members, I'd have taken it up years ago. I feel positively reborn in fire. Yes. Penance of the Flesh is the purest form of worship. It offers us both punishment and pleasure. [Zelda] Though I do wish we could meet someplace less... damp. Unfortunately, we must keep our devotions... secret. Lady Blackwood is not as liberated as I would like. [sighs] I miss the old days. When all witches were polyamorous, and monogamy was just for mortals. One of the False God's puritanical edicts. There is something to be said about having a single partner with whom you explore all the realms of agony and ecstasy. Zelda, as you know, nothing is more important to me than the birth of my twin sons. Yet, more and more, I worry Lady Blackwood is not the mother they'll need. Would you consider being an unholy godmother to them? Yes, I would be honored to be your boys' Night Mother. There is also the matter of Lady Blackwood's classes at the academy. Would you take them over? She fatigues easily these days. And be the Satanic Choir's interim director? [Sabrina] It worked. Tommy's back home with Harvey, who is so happy. And how is Tommy feeling himself? Fine. Does he have any sense of what happened to him? - Unclear. - Sabrina. [sighs] I didn't really talk to Tommy, but apparently he's in shock, which the doctor says is totally normal. Unless that doctor is a witch doctor, I'd get a second opinion. I knew you shouldn't have performed that resurrection. Everyone told you not to. Tommy will be back to himself in a couple of days, he'll be talking, he'll be eating. He's not eating? Oh! We have to tell the aunties. We can't. You can't. They'll find out eventually. This is a small town. A man coming back from the dead is big news. He didn't come back from the dead. - He dug himself out of the mines. - [Ambrose] Hmm. And you're right, they will find out, but by that time, Tommy will be back to normal, and they'll be mad, yes, but they won't be able to undo anything. Please, Ambrose, Harvey got his brother back. That's all that matters. [witches] O Mighty Dark Lord, by whom all things are set afire, thy power be the path, thy will be my desire. In hell as it is on earth. Praise Satan. Amen. [soft choking] Agatha... Agatha, what's the matter? [coughing] [Sabrina sighs deeply] [Salem meows] Salem... what's going on? - [meows] - What's wrong? [Nicholas] I think I make him nervous. Nicholas, what are you doing here? And how did you get into my room? I didn't. [bird flutters] You're astral-projecting. [Nicholas sighs] Agatha's sick. Really sick. Prudence says she's vomiting up dirt. What's that got to do with me? We killed her, buried her, and brought her back to life. The fact that Agatha's coughing up grave dirt can't be coincidence. - How's Tommy? - He's fine. He's up and about. You're a terrible liar. - Has anyone ever told you that? - You need to leave. [bird flutters] [bird cooing] You must really love that mortal boy, to risk everything for him. What's his name again? Harry? - Harvey. And, yes, I do. - [Nicholas] Oh. I hope he was appropriately grateful for what you did. Oh, wow. He doesn't know. That's incredibly dangerous, if it all goes south with his brother. Tommy's fine. Whatever's going on with Agatha will pass. You hope. [wings fluttering] I'll keep you posted. Salem, you need to go to Harvey's tonight - and keep watch. - [meows] To make sure that everything's okay, to make sure Harvey's safe. [Salem meows] I'm sure it's all fine, this is just a precaution, but go. [loud meow] [floor creaking] [Harvey] Tommy? Tommy? [mirror squeaking] [Harvey] Hey. You okay? [whispers] Hey. [Harvey grunts] What do you think of looking through some pictures? Doc Phibes said that might help. Look. Um... That was the day Mom and Dad took us to the carnival. I got lost in the Hall of Mirrors and you came to rescue me. Remember how pissed Dad was? [Harvey sighs] Yeah. Yeah, that's you. You were an All-Star, dude. MVP. Three years straight. We'd all go to your games. [purring] [Susie] I've never done anything like that before. - [Susie chuckles] - [Dorothea] You were born for this role. - [Susie] I can't. What if I get... - [Dorothea] Caught? Then you run. [Susie laughs] If my dad ever found out, I'd totally be grounded. - [knocking on door] - Yeah? [Mr. Putnam] Susie, can I come in? Sure. Who were you talking to? No one, Dad. [phone rings] [Hilda] Spellman Sisters Mortuary, how may I assist you? Oh, I see. Yes, yes. No, of course. We'll take care of the poor dears. Thank you. [Zelda] Yes, Hilda? Well, it seems that most, if not all, of the miners' bodies have been recovered. So they'll be arriving later today. And Satan willing, they'll bring some closure to those young men's families. By the way, Sabrina, how is Harvey coping with it all? He's hanging in there. Aunt Hilda, what time did you say the bodies were arriving? Um... This afternoon. I'm going to be at the bookstore. [Zelda] I can receive them. Uh, but do let me handle them, Aunt Zelda, when I'm back from the academy. [Zelda] Which is where I'll be later today as well. The High Priest has appointed me Directrix of the Satanic Choir. [Hilda] Oh! When did he do that? Never you mind, Hilda. You stick to cleaning up "spills on aisle five," or whatever it is you do in that tawdry little shop. In the meantime, Ambrose, Sabrina, and I will be restoring the luster to the Spellman family name. Good things are coming. I can feel it in my bones. [students chattering] [Wardwell] Did you feel it, too? Ms. Wardwell. - Feel what? - The Santa Diabla. The ill wind that blew through Greendale last night like a frisson of electricity. As though the curtain between worlds had been torn asunder. You didn't feel it? I don't think so. I... I pretty much stayed in last night. Oh, but surely you heard the dogs? Why, it sounded like every dog in Greendale was howling all night long. It was... exhilarating. Positively life-giving. Now you weren't thinking of... borrowing my Book of the Dead without permission, were you? Not when all you need do is ask. Go on. Take it. [Sabrina sighs, stammers] - Ms. Wardwell? - Yes? I picked up the wrong book. I was looking for... the Occultist's Almanac. For some extra credit I'm doing for Father Blackwood. Is it okay if I borrow it? - [students chattering] - [Roz exhales] Sabrina, is it true what everyone's saying? That Harvey's brother is alive? People already know? Mr. Baterman was delivering a UPS package across the street from Harvey's and said that he saw Tommy through the window. Yeah, it's a miracle. Or the exact opposite. Why do you say that, Roz? I had the most bizarre dream last night. [Roz] It was snowing. I was walking through the woods, and I heard this horrible sound. [hounds growling and barking] [Roz] And I came through, into this clearing. And there were these dogs fighting over... [gasps] What, Roz? The dogs were tearing Tommy Kinkle apart. Roz, was this dream like... like the vision you had? Of the girls in the mine? Okay, Roz, real talk. I'm worried about Harvey and more specifically, I'm worried that something might be wrong with Tommy. - Like what? - I'm not sure yet. But maybe... you could help us figure it out. - How? - With your... what did you call it? - I can't control the cunning. - Are you sure about that? You saw the girls in the mine when you touched Tommy's hard hat, right? Maybe, if... if we could get you close enough to Tommy... To, like, establish contact with him? You could see, immediately, if something is wrong with him. [Faustus] How do you find our academy, then? Liberating. Absolutely liberating, Your Excellency. [Faustus] Mmm. I can well imagine. I have a gift for you. A token of brotherhood. You've been denied a basic warlock right for too long. A familiar of your own. A goblin of the highest pedigree. His name... is Leviathan. [Leviathan squeaks] [Ambrose sighs] Uh, thank you, Father Blackwood. You... You honor me. These are exalted times for the Church of Night, Ambrose. I can feel it. Your friend Lucas here has been helping me with some plans to... reform... the coven. Its laws, its teachings, the very foundation it is built upon. Anything I can do for you, Your Excellency. Well, we'll see. In the meantime, perhaps you could start by helping Lucas translate a nine-volume set of the Apostate Gospels he's been struggling with. - Certainly. - [Faustus] I have my rounds. But feel free to, um... [clears throat] ...spread out. Certainly. And Brother Ambrose... welcome home. [Ambrose] Oh, Luke, - thank you... for making this possible. - [Luke breathing heavily] [Luke gasping] Don't thank me. It's Blackwood. - He sees something inside you. - [door opens] - Where is the High Priest? - [Luke sighs] Doing his rounds. Maybe you can help, then. You are a Spellman, after all. What's the problem? - Our sister Agatha is sick. - Vomiting soil. Spellman soil from that so-called Cain Pit. You saw us that night, Spellman. We did everything to the letter, and Thomas Kinkle is back and fine. So why is Agatha coughing up dirt and turnips? Not a clue. And who told you Tommy is fine? Sabrina. - Isn't he? - I believe the jury's still out on that. I don't care about the mortal, I care about my sister. We brought her back to life on your property, and now something's gone terribly wrong. So you're going to help us fix it. When it comes to matters of the Cain Pit, I'm no expert, but... I do know someone who is. - [hot coffee hissing] - [doorbells jingle] - [Hilda hums] - [music playing indistinctly] Here you go, lovey. [steam whooshing] [doorbells jingle] [door closes] [Billy] Well, well, well. What do you know? [chuckles] It's the little dyke girl. Been a while. What's up? Yeah, what are you up to? - Nothing. Shopping. - [Billy] What do you got under your shirt? I mean, definitely not boobs, but you got something. - Hey, let's see. - [both chuckle] - [Hilda] Excuse me? Excuse me? - [Carl whistles] I'll thank you to keep your hands to yourself. She started it. Uh-mmm. No, she didn't, Billy Marlin. [Susie pants] You know my name? Yeah. [scoffs] I know everything about you, Billy. And I know why you're a bully. And it's terrible, what happened to you at that summer camp when you were 11 years old. It is awful what those boys did to you, how none of your counselors believed you, how your dad didn't either, how your mother washed your mouth out with detergent until you just stopped talking. Doesn't give you the right to harass anybody, especially someone much smaller than you. So, why don't you and your chum, who's in lust with you, by the way... leave my store before I start telling everyone what happened. Come on. Let's go. Crack on. Don't let the door hit you on your way out. [doorbells jingle] [chuckles] You okay? Yeah, thanks. You're Sabrina's friend, right? Susie Putnam? What have you got there? Is it a book? I could treat you to it, if you want. Don't go! I... Mmm. [doorbells jingle] [HIlda scoffs] Ginnie Woolf. She could throw a dinner party. [snorts] - [phone ringing] - [Hilda humming] [sighs] Dr. Cerberus' Books and Spirits, how may I assist you? It started last night. [Hilda] Oh, I see. Yeah. [Hilda clears throat] Well... the Cain Pit is a miracle, really... but if you come back too soon, you'll make yourself ill. It's a form of decompression sickness, like when divers get the bends. Do it too fast and you're gonna vomit up half the cemetery. What do we do? Well, I reckon she has too much earth in her system, so we need to rebalance her elements. So, I suggest a tonic of fizzy water, which will give her water and air. And a dash of cayenne pepper for fire. Three times a day, for a week. She'll be right as rain. That's it? Fizzy water? Oh, but you'll serve it with love, won't you, darling? [door opens] Not to question you, auntie, but you just prescribed Alka-Seltzer to a girl who came back from the dead. [whispers] There's something to be said for keeping them busy. Ambrose, the dirt that she's coughing up is practically gravel, which tells me that Agatha shouldn't have been brought back in the first place. The earth is owed a soul, it means to collect. So, nephew, pray, tell me. What was Agatha doing in the Cain Pit in the first place? - [Sabrina] Tommy? - [door opens and closes] - [Harvey] He won't answer you. - [Sabrina] How's he doing? [Harvey sighs] I'll show you. Watch. - [Sabrina gasps] - [Roz] Oh, my God! [sighs] At first, I thought he was getting better. That he was remembering. [Harvey sighs] That's all he'll do. React, like a robot. [Roz] Harvey... uh, where's your dad? At the mines. He's already trying to get it back up and running, but he could be home at any minute. Has Tommy eaten anything yet? Not yet. Just water. Do you have any soup? - I think we do. - That might be a way to get him to eat. Lemme try that. I'll be right back. [Roz sighs] [inhales sharply] [baby crying] [distant whispers echoing] [Sabrina] Roz, do you see anything? - Any sign of Tommy? - [Roz] Sabrina? [gasps] [pants] - What happened? Are you okay? - [gasps] Um... I'm not sure. What did you see? Anything? I saw Tommy. Uh, he was lost in the woods and there was a fog. [sighs] He was confused. Was anyone else with him? No. No, he was alone. But, uh... I heard a baby crying. A baby? [door opens and closes] [Mr. Kinkle] What's going on here? Where's Harvey? The kitchen, Mr. Kinkle, we just came by to check in on Harvey and Tommy. Dad, they were helping. Like they know more than Doc Phibes? - We'll talk to you later, Harvey. - Yeah, okay. [Mr. Kinkle sighs deeply] I don't understand what the crying baby means. Yeah, me, neither. Roz, are you okay? Did you see something that you're not telling me? No. Just what I said. [Dorothea whispering] What happened after the boys surprised you? [softly] Ms. Spellman surprised them. And started saying things. Secret things. But they were true. And the boys got scared and ran off. [Dorothea] Spellman. Yeah, my... my friend Sabrina's aunt. Tell me, are they still witches... the Spellmans? Ambrose, I figured it out. It's something called "soul separation." We brought back Tommy's body, but not his soul. It's trapped in... Ambrose is in the basement, tending to the corpses, which have started to smell rather ripely. - Auntie Hilda, I can explain everything. - [Hilda] Um-mmm. No, your cousin already did that, in great detail. You lied to me. You did the one thing I told you not to do. Incorrectly to boot. I couldn't bear to see Harvey suffer like that, and I think I can fix this entire situation. I just have to put Tommy's soul back in his body. It's too late. No, it's not. Roz said she had a vision of Tommy lost in foggy woods, and that she heard a baby crying. That's limbo. Tommy's in limbo. It's where the souls of unbaptized babies go when they perish, or the souls of people who died before their time. I just need to get there... and retrieve Tommy's soul. [scoffs] Will you help me? [Hilda stammers] First of all, may I say, there are two limbos, Sabrina. One for witches, one for mortals. Tommy Kinkle is in mortal limbo. And it is simply impossible for witches to cross over into mortal limbo. But I'm not a witch, I'm a half-witch, - which means I can cross over. - You're assuming? Because meanwhile, the witch that you killed... and brought back to life is getting sicker and sicker. That's the Grim Reaper doing it to her. He's expecting a body. Her suffering won't end until there's one in the ground, until balance is restored. There's no fixing it, Sabrina. You've opened Pandora's box. [Ambrose] Guys. There's something you need to see. In the embalming room. ♪ Doe, a deer, a female deer ♪ ♪ Ray, a drop of golden sun ♪ ♪ Me, a name I call myself ♪ ♪ Far, a long, long way to run ♪ ♪ Sew, a needle pulling thread ♪ ♪ La, a note to follow sew ♪ ♪ Tea, a drink with jam and bread ♪ ♪ That will bring us back to ♪ ♪ Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do ♪ - [screams] - [girls gasp] Help me. [people murmuring] [Faustus] How did Agatha end up a living cadaver? Tell me everything, at once. It's all Sabrina's doing, Father. She wanted to resurrect a mortal that was crushed in the mine collapse. Sabrina performed a resurrection? With a Book of the Dead. She slit Agatha's throat as part of the ritual... to bring the Kinkle boy back. And then brought Agatha back to life in a Cain Pit in the Spellman's yard. But something's gone wrong. The boy is alive. Thomas Kinkle is alive? But Agatha's getting sicker and sicker. Your Excellency, I knew nothing of this, I swear it. - But I can... - You can what? Control Sabrina? Punish her? No. You've proven, time and again, that you cannot. Girls, take Agatha to where you should've in the first place: the Infernal Infirmary. I'll make short work of the resurrected boy, restore the balance, clean up this bloody mess. Please, Father, allow me. Sabrina is my niece, my responsibility. [breath trembling] Her transgression is mine. Whatever she did, I will undo. Give me a chance to make things right. I will not fail you again. Do it, then. [inhales deeply] Thank you. [Ambrose] That wound. And that one. Those are bite marks. These... teeth, they're... Human. Yep. Taking a guess, I think, that's why Tommy hasn't eaten. He isn't hungry. Yet. Harvey. [man on TV] What are you doing here? I've got a question for you. Why don't you tell me who you are? - Come on, Dad, you're drunk. - The hell I am. Yeah, you are! You've been drinking since the accident, but you can stop now. Tommy's back. You believe that? That this vegetable is Tommy? Don't call him that. That's what he is. [man on TV] Get out of here. A damn zombie. - Snap out of it, for pity's sake. - Dad, back off. - You in there? Anybody home? - Dad! Leave Tommy alone! I would, except this thing ain't Tommy. I don't know what the hell it is, but it ain't my son. And if you are... you might as well have stayed in the mines. Hey! - [Mr. Kinkle] You piece of shit. - [Harvey grunts] Tommy! Tommy! Tommy, no! Stop it! Tommy... Tommy, stop it! - Tommy, stop! Tommy! - [glass shatters] - Tommy! Tommy! - [choking] [Mr. Kinkle coughs] [Sabrina] Mr. Kinkle! Don't go in there. He's an animal! He's not my son. Harvey? [Sabrina pants] What happened? - [Tommy panting] - My dad punched me - and then Tommy tried to kill him. - What? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just trying to get him calmed down. Maybe he's thirsty. Here. Give him some of this. That's the only time Tommy looks normal. When he's asleep. [Sabrina] Harvey, Tommy will get better. Just like the doctor said, he's... in shock. No. Something's wrong with him, 'Brina. And I know, all I should be is grateful. And I am, but... in the back of my mind, I keep wondering... how did Tommy get out? How did he survive? You saw his hard hat. It was covered in blood. He was under all that rock... and not a single broken bone? Hey, you'll... We'll get through this. Trust me. It's not over. Sabrina... But you have to be careful. Tommy's asleep now. I bet he'll sleep through the night. But if he doesn't, and he tries to hurt you, you have to run. Harvey... do you promise? Aunties? [sighs] Are you here? I need... [Zelda] I frankly don't care what you need, Sabrina. But I'll tell you what I need. An explanation. For whya Spellman was practicing necromancy on a mortal boy in Greendale. She knows everything, love. And why, in Satan's name, she would drag other witches into her reckless, stupid, selfish plans? I did it for Harvey. [Zelda] Did you? And tell me, did he ask you to do it? No, because no one in their right mind would do what you did. How did you even know what spell to use? - Ambrose says he didn't give it to you. - I didn't. Ms. Wardwell. - She gave it to you? - No. No, I... took a book from her office. Oh, so you're a thief, as well as a murderer. - Murderer? - You killed a witch, didn't you? Just for a few minutes. This is not a joke, Sabrina. You've thrown off the balance. Not me, Agatha and Dorcas. They killed Tommy. This wasn't some natural disaster. I was undoing what witches did. All you did was make things worse. I'm going to fix this, I am going to save Tommy. Fix what? There's nothing to fix, and he can't be saved. It's done, Sabrina. He belongs in the ground and that's where he's going. Not if I pass over into mortal limbo and bring his soul back. I'm half-mortal, I can go there. If you what? I just need someone to anchor me here on the physical plane. Sabrina... I have just spent the very last of my credibility with the High Priest... begging, begging him to let us clean up your mess, to take care of this atrocity ourselves, to save our family in the eyes of the coven. We're standing in a grave, young lady, all of us, and you want to dig it deeper? I don't care about the High Priest, Aunt Zee. I care about what's right. And about Harvey. And his brother. I'm going to cross over. You're not capable of the magic required to cross the barrier. You don't know what I'm capable of. You're a 16-year-old child, not some grand magus! And you're not my mother, Zelda, so stop acting like you are! Oy! You do not speak to your Aunt Zelda like that. Not ever! It's fine, Hilda. You heard her. She's not a child, and I'm not her mother. She's a grown-up witch now, and it's time she learned how the world, the realms, really work. Everything has a price. Edward learned that lesson. I learned it. It's your turn now. Try to save this mortal, even if it rips the membrane to pieces. But don't pretend it's not for selfish reasons. And don't come crying to me when it all blows up in your face. No one will help you, just as Aunt Zee says. You're wrong, Ambrose. There's someone. [scoffs] [knock on door] I need your help, Ms. Wardwell. I'm sorry I lied... and I'm sorry I stole the Book of the Dead from your office... but I'm not sorry for what I did. I mean, how could I sit by and watch Harvey suffer without trying to do something? I understand. We've all done... unspeakable things to help the ones we love. But, Sabrina... limbo, mortal or witch, is a realm at the edge of death. The souls trapped there are lost in ways we can't understand. Hunted by a monstrosity, a... Soul-Eater that... devours those it catches. Are you certain you want to take the risk in going there? Harvey would do it for me in a heartbeat. In that case, I... I know a threshold. A portal, deep in the woods. But we'll have to tread lightly and quickly, Sabrina. The very slightest mistake... could spell disaster for you... and poor Mr. Kinkle's brother. - [whip cracking] - [Hilda knocking on door] Zelds? [Hilda] No! No, no, no, no, no! Stop it! No, no, no, no, no, no! - Zee, why would you do that to yourself? - [Zelda pants] - There we go. - [Zelda sighs] There we go. [Zelda's breath trembling] - [Zelda] We were wrong. - What? [Zelda sniffles] [softly] All those years ago. We should never have taken Sabrina in. We should've let Diana's family have her. [breath trembling] It was my arrogance. To think I could raise her. Guide her. [Zelda sniffles, sighs] [voice breaking] But she looked so much like Edward. Remember? [sobs] I couldn't say no. I could never say no to Sabrina. - Zelda... - [sniffles] ...you always say no to Sabrina. [chuckles] She just doesn't listen to you. [sniffles] [Hilda] Come on, now. Come on. Let's have enough of that. [Faustus] Prudence, Dorcas, heed me. The returned boy is a soulless husk. Every moment he draws air, he risks exposing the Church of Night and our magics. Despite Zelda's promise, the Spellmans are too recalcitrant to be trusted with bringing this situation to a satisfactory conclusion. But you, girls, had a hand in his reanimation. You will put an end to Thomas Kinkle. And be quick about it. [Dorcas] Perhaps I'll tear out his heart, give it to Agatha after the trouble he's put her through? Or we could place his head on a spike. You heard what my father said, Dorcas. Let's just get this done. - [traps clanging] - [Dorcas, Prudence scream] [Dorcas] What's happening? What is happening? - [Prudence] I don't know. - [both wailing] [Nicholas] My apologies, ladies. Nicholas! What have you done to us? It's an old catching spell. Drive a spike through a witch's footprint and she'll be rooted to the spot until you pull up the spike. Why are you doing this? My father gave us orders. The Spellmans are handling this, Prudence. And you, Dorcas, and I are staying right here until they're finished. [Wardwell] Not so fast. Give me your wrist. So I don't lose track of you. Tug on it three times when you're heading back, and I'll open the portal on this side. Understand? Thank you, Ms. Wardwell. Well... Not at all, Sabrina. Now... recite the words. Redi ad periculum tuum. [wind whooshes] [screams echoing from the portal] [screams continue from portal] I'll be waiting right here for you. [screaming continues] [distant whispers echoing] [baby crying in distance] [Sabrina shouts] Tommy? Tommy? [wind whooshes] [distant whispers echoing] Mom? What are you doing here? [Diana] Who are you? Mom, it's me. Sabrina. Sabrina? No. No, Sabrina was my baby. And she was baptized. Only... unbaptized babies go to limbo. Mom, I promise you, it's me. But they took her. They took my baby after the baptism. Who did? - [distant roaring] - Are you okay? The witches are coming. - [wind whooshes] - [growling] - What's that? - [Diana] The Soul-Eater. - Don't let him get you. - [heavy footsteps] [Diana] Save yourself! [Soul-Eater growling and roaring] [heavy footsteps] [Sabrina panting] - [Tommy] Sabrina? - [Sabrina gasps] Tommy! Tommy, we have to go. Where are we? I was in the mines... Tommy, everything is gonna be all right, but we have to go. - [girl] No! - [Soul-Eater roaring] [Sabrina] We have to run! [man screaming] - [woman screaming] - [Soul-Eater growling and roaring] [Sabrina] Ms. Wardwell! I've got Tommy! - [heavy footsteps] - [Soul-Eater growls] [Sabrina] Open the portal! [rope snaps] [Soul-Eater growling and roaring] - [woman screams] - [crunch] [shouts] Hear me, Spirits of the Dead, and reveal the portal! Help me to pass through with this brave mortal! [Soul-Eater growling] [wind whooshes] [Soul-Eater shrieks, crunches] Sabrina, what... No! No! No. No. No. Ms. Wardwell, I have to go back in there. I found Tommy once, I can find him again. Sabrina, you can't. From what we just saw, it seems the Soul-Eater's gotten him. What does that mean? You know what it means. But I promised Harvey I'd fix this. [softly] But you still can. Painful... but there's one path left for you to follow. But if I tell him... If your love is true... he'll understand. [caws] Well, Stolas. It took longer than I or the Dark Lord might have liked, but... finally it's about to happen. Sabrina's primary tie to the mortal world, Harvey Kinkle... is about to be severed. And Satan be praised. She'll have no one to blame... - but herself. - [Stolas caws] Yes, Stolas... we should go check on her chums, too. [Roz] Susie, um... you remember when we went to see my Nana Ruth? Of course. - She called me a handsome fellow. - [both chuckle] Yeah, and she said all that weird stuff about the cunning and how it's like ESP. How witches cursed the Walker family and that's why so many of us have gone blind. Yeah. Susie, I think it may be true. All of it. [Roz sighs] I can see things, things I shouldn't be able to. Like ghosts? More like... visions. And secrets. About people. What kind of secrets? Like about me? No. Like about Sabrina. She's been hiding something from us. Something really, really big. - I think I may know. - I think Sabrina might be a witch. And I know... I know how crazy that sounds. - That our best friend might be... - I think all the Spellmans are. My Aunt Dorothea wrote about them in her journals. So you believe me? You believe it could be possible? I think Greendale's a pretty weird town, Roz. I'm starting to believe anything is possible. Agreed. [sighs] But what does it mean to be a witch? Uh... Like, is Sabrina evil? Or dangerous? I don't know. [slurping] [wind whistling] [Sabrina] Where's your dad? Um... at the bar. How's Tommy? The same. [sighs] Still sleeping. Harvey, I have something to tell you. Something I can't hide from you anymore. What is it? I'm ready for just about anything at this point. Tommy's asleep because I gave him a few drops of sleep potion. What do you mean potion? It was mixed in with the water I brought with me. And... the reason Tommy came back... is because... I... performed a ritual to bring him back. Sabrina, what are you talking about? I'm a witch, Harvey. You've... You've told me this before. Just before my 16th birthday. But then... I made you forget... with a spell. How can I believe you? How can I... How can I believe this? When you were eight, you saw a demon in the mines. You knew Jesse Putnam was possessed before anyone else did. You come from a family of witch hunters. And your brother... What? What about Tommy? That's not really him... in Tommy's room, in Tommy's bed. - Of course it is. - No. No, I... [in a trembling voice] I performed a... resurrection spell... to help Tommy... and you, too. Because... Because I knew you would do the same for me. But it all went wrong. I brought back Tommy's body, but not his soul... not the part of him that's really Tommy. What are you talking about? That is Tommy. No, Harvey... it's not. You know it's not. If that's not Tommy, then who... what is it? Something else. Something I need... to put back in the ground... [breathes deeply] ...before things get worse. - Why, Sabrina, why did you... - I wanted to fix this for you. I wanted you to stop hurting. You shouldn't have done anything. You should've left Tommy where he was. That's why I need to make this right. That's why I need to put what's in Tommy's room... back. Back where? What do you... - Sabrina... - I have to. It's the only way. Will it... Will it hurt him? No. No, I don't think he feels things like we do. How? How are you gonna do it? I... could... [sniffs] I don't even know. - I'll do it. - No! No, Harvey, you don't... you... - You shouldn't... - He's my brother, Sabrina, and I... I don't want you to be the person that did that to any part of Tommy. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You... You have to go. Why? I don't want to. So I can... do this before my dad gets back, before I... before I chicken out. And I... And I... I can't talk to you again... for a while. Harvey... Harvey, please, let me stay. Let me at least help. No, Sabrina, you've... you've done enough. [door opens and closes] [taking deep breaths] [breathing heavily] [rifle cocks] [exhales] [gunshot] Is it done, then? [thunder rumbling] [sobs] It's over, Aunt Zelda. Tommy's gone... [sniffs] ...and Harvey and I... [Sabrina crying] [thunder continues] [wind blows] [theme music playing] [man] Brett, move your head.
