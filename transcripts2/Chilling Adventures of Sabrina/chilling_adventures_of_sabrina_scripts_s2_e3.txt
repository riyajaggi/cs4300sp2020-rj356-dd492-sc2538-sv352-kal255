 Ambrose. Won't Luke get jealous about you and Prudence? Luke's out of town on a mission for Father Blackwood. Oh, loosen up, Sabrina. We're just getting warmed up for Lupercalia, if you even know what that is. It's witches' Valentine's Day, right? Lupercalia coincides with mortal Valentine's Day, yes. But in my opinion, it's just a lot of hype. Oh, please, Nick. Sabrina's not so naive and innocent as all that. No one is after signing the Dark Lord's Book of the Beast. ♪ All I know ♪ ♪ Is what I feel ♪ Aunties, what exactly is Lupercalia?

 Oh! It's a lusty, pastoral festival started by the Roman witches under the reign of Caligula. Named after the Lupercal, the cave where the twin founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, were suckled by the She-Wolf. It was instituted as a means to purify the city and increase health and fertility. Nowadays, it's less about fertility, and it's more about... blah-blah-blah. - Sex, Hilda. - Yes. - S-E-X. Sex. - I know. I know. I can spell it. There will be much fanfare about it at the Academy. Father Blackwood, of course, will be Master of the Hunt. So, it's a hunt? The festival is comprised of three events. The Matching, during which you are paired with a random warlock. The Courting, where you and said warlock spend the night together in unholy abstinence. And the Hunt, a run through the woods which climaxes in a frenzy of orgiastic carnality. Is participating in the Lupercalia voluntary or mandatory? - Voluntary. - But everyone does it. - Because, again, it's about... - Yes, Aunt Zelda, but if I'm not yet actively having S-E-X... - What better time to start? - Zelda! How dare you pressure her like that. - I'm doing nothing of the kind, Hilda. - Huh. Sabrina, Lupercalia is a symphony of sensuality and pleasure, not shame and regret, as the False God and your Aunt Hilda would have you believe. Yes, but if you are not ready yet, my love... She signed her name in the Book of the Beast, Hilda. She's a young, powerful woman now. Aunt Hilda's right, Aunt Zee. I don't know that I am ready. But I don't know that I'm not ready, either. I just always assumed my first time would be with Harvey. And I've come to terms with the fact that that’s not gonna happen, which is okay. But if it were with someone I liked and trusted... You've been spending quite a lot of time with that handsome Nicholas Scratch fellow. Who I trust about as much as I trust a wolf. And one more thing. Read this. It will tell you all you need to know about the Lupercalian rituals. A little late night reading? Nick! Ugh! What if I were doing something private? Uh, depending on how private, I would be really embarrassed. Just knock first, okay? I would, but I'm astral-projecting. I... Next time, I will, I promise. I just wanted to check up on you after Dorian's and to tell you that there's no pressure. You wanna participate in Lupercalia, great. You wanna bail on it and watch scary movies together, that's great, too. As long as I can hold your hand. Like I told my aunties, I'm on board with the spirit of Lupercalia, as long as I get to experience it one-on-one, with someone special. Makes sense. And, um... could I possibly be that someone special? Well, let's see what happens at the Matching. Who knows, maybe we'll get paired. Leave that to me, Spellman. ♪ I know something about love ♪ ♪ You gotta want it bad ♪ ♪ If that guy's got into your blood ♪ ♪ Go out and get him ♪ ♪ Tell him that You're never gonna leave him ♪ ♪ Tell him that You're always gonna love him ♪ ♪ Tell him, tell him, tell him right now ♪ Oh, what fools these mortals be. It's terrible, Stolas, this... indignity I must endure after losing my wager to our Dark Lord. Even though Sabrina no longer attends Baxter High, He wishes I maintain this... humiliating pretense that I'm some unattractive, unhappy spinster schoolmarm. I mean, please. Look at me. What? Poison the punch at the Sweethearts Dance? You're quite right, Stolas. Though the Dark Lord forbids we harm a white hair on Sabrina's head, He's never said boo about her ex-classmates. Of course, killing them won't help solve my problems, but... it might help me forget them. Harvey... you made me a card? That's so nice. Uh... Thank you. You're welcome. I, uh... was wondering... Are you go... Are you going to the Sweethearts Dance? Yeah, uh, Theo and I already got our tickets. But all three of us can go together. Wait. Unless you were asking me to go, like, on a date? I was, potentially, but I definitely don't want you to change your plans with Theo. So, yeah, we can go as friends, all three of us, sure. Ah. Lupercalia. It gets the blood pumping in ways our other, more staid traditions simply do not. Indeed it does. Why, you, yourself, look a good 70 years younger, Sister Zelda. Glowing. Radiant. Fecund. We should get down to business, don't you think, Your Excellency? Welcome, one and all, to Lupercalia, the Festival of the Wolves. Brother Ambrose. All right, fellas, take your places for the Matching! Don't even think about it, half-breed. Two years ago, Prudence was paired with Nick for Lupercalia. Last year, Agatha was. This year, it's my turn. All right, ladies, you know how this goes. When the music stops, take a seat on the warlock closest to you. Oh, sorry, Sabrina. Wait, then who? What? Melvin? Uh... Nick gave me 100 bucks to wear a glamour. He thought you might try something like this. ♪ My sugar tastes sour My salt tastes sweet ♪ ♪ I wanna lay down But I just can't sleep ♪ ♪ It's your voodoo, baby ♪ Hilda, you're not on the schedule to work today. No, I'm not. Um... Well, because you haven't given me very many shifts since before the holidays. Um... So... um... We had a... Sorry... We had a moment... um, right after the storm... Um... since then... It was a moment, yes, Hilda. A moment that shouldn't have happened. Oh. Why not? We both felt it, didn't we? I'm your boss, you're my employee. Okay, well, then I quit. There you go, problem solved. Hilda. Okay, that's not the problem, then, is it? Well, I didn't think so. Um... Okay. Uh, well, I'm gonna leave that with you. Get out of your... way. This is fun, Roz. - We haven't done this in forever. - No, I know. Um... But I had to ask you something, and I wanted it to be face-to-face. Okay. Over the last few weeks, Harvey and I have been hanging out. And, well, he asked me to go to the Sweethearts Dance with him. And I haven't said yes yet, because we're still friends. Roz... Harvey and I are over. For real this time. - 'Brina, are you sure? - A hundred percent. I'm... - I'm sort of dating someone new, too. - What? - Tell me everything. - Well, he's a warlock. His name is Nicholas Scratch. Oh! He sounds sexy. - He is. - 'Brina, you're being careful, right? Yeah. No, uh... We're taking things slow. But I do like him, Roz. Aww! Did you, uh... get any Valentines at school today? We don't really do that anymore, Dad. But there is a dance. - I'm going with Harvey and Roz. - That's nice. Do you wanna get a new dress for that? You always look so nice in dresses. Uh, I, um... I was actually thinking I could maybe wear a suit to the dance. Why would you do that? Because I'd feel better in a suit. Uh... I feel more myself in boy's clothes. Actually, Dad, I don't think I'm a girl at all. - Ah, Susie... - Dad. Um... I'm not a girl. Even though I look like a girl, even though I have a girl's name, even though you've always thought of me as a girl. I'm a boy. But you've always been my best girl. I mean, look at you. I feel good when people call me "he" and "young fella." Like Roz's grandma did. I can't keep going on as a girl anymore. I just can't, Dad. - Susie, I don't... - Theo. Maybe you could start by calling me Theo. After Dorothea. Okay. Uh, and maybe, um... Maybe you could take me to get a new haircut? Come on. Witches. Warlocks. Congratulations, you have been matched. Tonight, you and your paramour shall go into the woods and re-enact the Courting. What that means is that each couple shall go into the woods and disrobe and anoint themselves and lie under this blessed Lupercalian moon, absorbing the potency of the Goddess Selene Herself. Abstinence is encouraged... ...in anticipation of the powerful release that concludes Lupercalia. However, should couples be moved to unite, Well, I'm sure the Dark Lord would not oppose. The milk and blood are for the purification. The oysters and figs are for fertility and virility. The cherries are for... popping. A word or two of caution. Each couple must stay together the entire night. And, above all, do not stray from the path. All manner of lust-filled creatures stalk the woods during the Lupercalia. Now, with the Dark Lord's blessing, let the Courting begin. Someone must've miscounted. There was an extra anointment basket prepared. Shame to let it go to waste. Nervous? Maybe a little bit. About what in particular? Everything. I mean, we're not even officially boyfriend and girlfriend, and yet tomorrow, we have to take part in some crazy bacchanal. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm terrified. Yeah, right. I caught you in the attic with my cousin having an orgy. Okay, that was different. In what way? Uh... I think it has to do with the fact that I've never been with a mortal before. Not even a half-mortal. You're pretty special, Spellman. I don't wanna mess things up with you. I'm pleased to be in these woods with you again, Zelda. Though it violates the terms you set. That we keep our relations professional. It is the Lupercalia. One night of carnality won't kill us. No. I shouldn't think it would. Mm. By Lilith's blood. By Lucifer's love. Oh, and, uh... don't forget to laugh. What? To laugh. You have to be laughing while you smear the blood off with the milk. What? I don't know why, by the way. It's just part of the festival. - Well, it's ridiculous. - Yeah, isn't it? Still have more. - There. - But, hey, when in Rome... Now what? We lay side by side, soaking up the moon. Hmm. How long do we do this for? All night long. Till dawn. That sounds amazing. - Is... Is that... - A wolf. - Was that... - A wolf? Definitely. There aren't usually wolves this close to town. That sounds pretty close, Nick. Agreed. Let's get the Heaven out of here, Sabrina. Hey, crazy idea. But what if we take a break from the woods and the rituals and all the, um... howling of Lupercalia and just observe mortal Valentine's Day, instead? I mean, won't you be disappointed if you don't get to do... certain things? No. There'll be another Lupercalia next year. Oh! So you still think we'll be together next year. I hope so. If you weren't at the Academy, what would you be doing for V-Day? I don't know. There's usually a dance at Baxter High. Perfect. Good grief. Hilda, what's the matter with you? It's... The... I gave Dr. Cee my heart. And I asked him if he would be my Valentine, but he doesn't want me. - Now, sister, compose yourself. - Right... You, Hilda Spellman, are no ordinary woman to be brushed aside like the ashes from yesterday's Sabbath pyre. You, Hilda, are a huntress. I don't know... If you tease me, I can't take it. I'm not teasing you, I'm encouraging you. Make this glorified carny you're sweet on feverish with lust. Seduce him. Put on the glamour of the century, march into that store and claim what's yours! Okay. Why are our beds so high? Principal Wardwell, you have a special visitor. Mary. - Yes? - I told you I'd be back in time for Valentine's Day. Right. And you always keep your promises, don't you? Oh, I... I don't know... what to say. I was gonna surprise you at the cottage, but I couldn't wait. I'm glad you didn't. You look so different. - You don't approve? - No, I... I love it. I can't believe I'm finally seeing you again after... how many months? Well, it's... Seems like an eternity. Why don't we continue this back at the cottage? It's... I'm afraid I really got my hands full here. Of course, you're principal now. Uh... I'll get out of your hair. See you... back at the cottage. I'll see you. Mrs. Meeks? I need you to tell me everything you know about that man that was just here. You mean your fiancé Adam? Adam? Hey, Harvey, can I talk to you for a second? Sabrina. Are you back? Again? No. No, I'm not coming back, exactly, but... I was wondering if it would be... weird, or... okay if I go to the dance tonight? With that Nick Scratch guy? I know you and Roz are going. Yeah, you can come to the dance, Sabrina. And bring whoever you want. We're not boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. Great. See you there. Hello. Adam. Mary! I've got dinner comin' up. Mm. And I fixed a few things. Your sink was dripping, the cross was upside down. Oh. Wow. You... have been a busy boy. Why don't you sit down, honey, and, uh... I'll give you a neck rub. Well, we have a little time to kill. - Sure. - So... Adam. You've been working for that charity group. Mm. Physicians Without Frontiers. And we've been dating for three years, but... you're often out of town, traveling. Not anymore. I promised you, that was my last big trip away. Oh! I brought you a gift. Disturbing. Also beautiful. It's a fetish doll from the Shona people. I must admit, I... I really love it. Well, I really love you. When I was at Baxter High, I saw posters for the Sweethearts Dance tonight. Oh, yeah. I... I'm afraid I'm chaperoning. Perfect. I'll come with you. It'll be like old times. And then, you put the blade through the neck loop, just like, uh... Like... that? Yeah. Then you tighten. Exactly. Honestly, that's better than any tie I've ever tied. You're a natural, Theo. My, what handsome-looking young men. Whoa. Nice haircut, Theo. Thanks, Roz. - You look... - Whoa. Nice tux, Nick. Wow. So, you're takin' a break from Lupercalia, too? I'm, er, saving up my juices for the Hunt. Hmm. I asked Ambrose if he wanted to join us, but he already said no. Sabrina. You look stunning. I mean, seriously, I'm stunned. Oh, well... well, thank you. Thank you very much. Sabrina. Nicholas. Enjoy the dance. And remember, Hilda, you're a huntress, and he's your prey. - Dear Satan, yes! Damn! - Huntress! - Rawr! - Happy hunting. - Ooh... - Whew. Uh, sorry, we're closed. Uh, I said we're clo... Hilda. What are you... What are you doing here? You... You shouldn't be here, not... like that. - Uh... - Well... Why not? Uh... I mean... I fancy you... ...and you fancy me. I know you do. Um... So why don't we do what two m-mature... and consenting and... passionate adults are wont to do? Oh... - No, I can't. No. - Why? Why? You have to go. Why? Please look at me. Please. Please... ♪ Dark in the city, night is a wire ♪ ♪ Steam in the subway, earth is afire ♪ Mary Wardwell, are you spiking the punch? I thought chaperones were supposed to do the opposite. Make sure kids weren't spiking the punch bowl. Don't judge me. Judge you? Mary, I want to dance with you. May I? ♪...upon you by the moonlight side ♪ ♪ Do do-do-do, do-do-do ♪ ♪ Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do ♪ Is this weird? Me and you? Compared to a lot of things that have happened this year? No, it's not weird. - Yeah. Okay. - Mm. In terms of, like, normal people, yeah. It is a little. But it's also nice. Yeah, I think so, too. Welcome to Baxter High. Not quite as magical as the Academy. Are you kidding? Being here with you, getting to see this other side of you, it's... it's more magical than anything at the Academy. May I have this dance, milady? You most certainly may. ♪ Oh, oh, here she comes ♪ ♪ She'll only come out at night ♪ ♪ The lean and hungry type ♪ ♪ Nothing is new ♪ I've seen her here before ♪ ♪ Watching and waiting ♪ ♪ Ooh, she's sitting with you ♪ ♪ But her eyes are on the door ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, here she comes ♪ ♪ She's a maneater ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, here she comes ♪ Nice haircut.

I'm sorry, Billy. It's not your fault. And I'm sorry, Theo. For being such a dick to you. Why are you apologizing to me? The doctor said I was lucky it wasn't my neck that I broke on those stairs. And I'm tired of bad things happening to me. Apology accepted. ♪ Slowly you're slipping ♪ ♪ Under a spell ♪ What are you thinkin'? Wanna see the rest of the school? Are you asking me to sneak off with you and go somewhere private? Lead the way, Spellman. - Roz... - Yeah? Uh, Harvey, wait.Uh... I've already seen this kiss happen. - In your mind? Me, too. - No. No, no, no. Um... I had a vision of us kissing. And, oh, my God, I have to tell you something. Least favorite words ever. I see things. Like... premonitions. But not just of things that have already happened. Sometimes of things that are gonna happen. Does that make sense? Uh... ♪ Slowly you're slipping ♪ ♪ Under a spell ♪ ♪ Live in your head ♪ ♪ And smile at the Devil ♪ It's a lot cozier than the Academy's library. Isn't it, though? Nick, did you hear that? Sabrina. Run. Vobis non transeat. Nick, what the hell is that? - Amalia, please listen to me. - Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait. You know what that is? I do. Long story. Tell you as soon as I banish her. Ergo draco maledicte ego invoco, tollere lux in carne haec nocte. Ms. Spellman. Mr. Scratch, I presume. May I see you in my office? Well, it's... it's complicated. I was hoping it wasn't her, but it is. - And, um... - Nick, how do you know the werewolf? Um... She's, um... She's my familiar. Her name is Amalia. She was given to me at birth. When my family died, she was the only real family I had left. What happened to her? When I started at the Academy and couldn't bring her with me, she just started showing up everywhere. At the dorm, in class, at Dorian's. Everywhere I looked, I saw her yellow eyes in the shadows just... watching me. And when I started going on dates, she got jealous. Like, scary jealous. Well, wolves are territorial animals. But this was to the point of obsession. I mean, Amalia wouldn't let anyone get close to me. So I... I banished her. Years ago. To the dark forests at the base of the Mountains of Madness. Well, that's on another continent, Nick. How and why is she back? I've had girlfriends before, and Amalia's never shown up, but maybe... Maybe she feels our connection. Sabrina. My former High Priest at the Church of Shadows once had a familiar. A cougar. She mauled the High Priest's wife and baby so badly, there was... Well, there was really nothing much left of them to bury. The familiar was, uh... infected, you see. Rabid with jealousy, it... Unfortunately, there is only one solution. Forgive my cavalier language, Mr. Scratch, but... you have to put that bitch down. I guess my first question... my main question is... are you a witch? No. I'm definitely not a witch. Cursed by witches, yes, but... 100% no. My grandma called us "cunning women." I just didn't want us to... um... Oh! ...without you knowing the truth. And I know weird stuff might be a trigger for you. Thanks for telling me, Roz. And yeah, weird stuff is a trigger for me. But honesty's kind of the thing I value most these days. So, we're good? We will be. As soon as... What? I... Was that... like your vision? Usually my visions lead to something bad happening. This time... Nothing bad happened, Rosalind. Well, I have to admit, I never imagined the evening playing out like this. Really? How did you see it ending? Would you believe if I said in a mass-murder? Oh. Careful. A girl could get used to this. I want you to get used to this, Mary. I'm home now. For good. And I plan to treat you... like the goddess you are. I don't think your bird likes me. You never mind Stolas. Just keep doing what you're doing. ♪ For that devil ♪ ♪ In your soul ♪ Nick? You sure you don't want me to come with you? No. I need to do this alone. Qui affecto protego, mixtisque iubas serpentibus et posteris meis stirpique. You summoned me, Your Excellency? I did. As you well know, since the death of my wife, I have been reluctant to make our relationship "official," as you put it. Partly because my marriage to Constance... drained me. I would hardly be a burden to you, Father Blackwood. If anything, I could help you realize your ambitions as High Priest. As I did for my brother Edward when he was High Priest. That's the other source of my reluctance. When we were at the Academy, Zelda, when I was mentor to Edward, and he was my protégé, I confided in him that I planned to ask for your hand in marriage... and your brother... well... he, um... - rebuked me. - Edward did? But I confess I have felt his... specter... hovering over us, even in the woods last night. But this morning, after my... prayers and reflection, I had a revelation from the Dark Lord... that the time for us... has come. Turtle-dove hearts. Faustus, you're proposing marriage? It is the Dark Lord's will. We both know it. Perhaps it has always been so. The Dark Lord notwithstanding, I shall consider your proposal... and get back to you. Don't come any closer. I owe you an apology and an explanation. Mm-hmm. Bloody right you do. I collect books, rare books. For the store. And some years ago, I came upon an occult tome. And in this book, there was a... spell for conjuring a demon. I tried it on a lark. Never expected that it would actually work, but... It did. And so the... the demon is still inside you? Yes. And as insane as it must sound to someone who has no knowledge of the satanic... uh, I'm... possessed by an incubus... that I can't get rid of. What happened earlier, it... it only happens when my passions are... inflamed. So, um... so that's why you didn't open my Valentine? That's why I cannot be near you anymore, Hilda. You excite me too much. I'm sick, Hilda... and I can't be cured. And I understand if you want to run for the hills. But the truth is... I love you. But I can't expect you to love a monster in return. You love me? Well, um... Well, then... I have to tell you something about myself. Nicholas. I'm so sorry, Nick. Ms. Wardwell was right. Amalia was insane with rage and jealousy. She would've done anything to keep us apart, including hurting you. And I couldn't let that happen. You killed her... for me? So we could be together. Tonight, for the last night of Lupercalia, I want it to be just us, Sabrina, far away from the others. After the Hunt begins, meet me at the mossy stump. There's nothing to be afraid of now. We can stray from the path. I'd love that, Nick. Father Blackwood has proposed. What? What? He did not! He did not! Zelda! I thought I had news, but this... You're gonna get married to a High Priest. Oh, that means a Black Wedding. And I can bake. - Are you ecstatic? - Ecstatic? You don't seem ecstatic. I'm very pleased, yes. Oh, good. Yeah, I can tell. So... do you not love him? No, Hilda. I don't love Faustus. A bit lost now. I... respect him. I'm going to accept his proposal, but not for love. - Hmm. - For power. Oh. Faustus and I are well-suited. He'll make a worthy opponent in marriage. And by his side, I'll bolster him, as well as restore our family's luster and seek my own glory in the process. Oh, Zelda... What's your news? Did you entrap the shopkeeper with your glamour? Um... Not exactly. He's an incubus. A sex demon. Oh, Hildie. Well, I'm reading up on how to, you know... tame him. You'll need chains forged from Damascus steel, strong enough to contain the most aggressive incubus. Fair warning, he'll need to be wearing them whenever you... Oh, no, no, no, no! How do you know so much about Damascus steel and chains and incubi? Oh, sister. As if I haven't tangled with my fair share of sex demons. - Stop it! - You'll be just fine. We both will. After the Hunt, all I can say is, poor Melvin. He doesn't know what's in store for him tonight. Can you imagine? A virgin, at his age? You'll be gentle with him, won't you, sister? And afterwards, we'll all share. - It's been ages since we had a virgin. - Unfortunately, you're too late. I initiated Melvin the night of the Courting. You didn't abstain? Of course not. Did you? A girl doesn't kiss and tell. But hurry, sisters, it's time to assemble outside. A fruitful Hunt to us all. Are you coming, Sabrina? I still need to take my berries of phylaxis. Go ahead. I'll catch up. - So, you're not really here? - I'm astral projecting. My body's back at the Academy, surrounded by candles, but... this is kind of a face-to-face conversation. Uh-huh. And does it have anything to do with the fact that you're dressed like Little Red Riding Hood? It does. It's the final night of this festival. The Lupercalia. Long story short... I might be losing my virginity tonight. Okay... Okay. Well, with whom? The guy I was telling you about. Okay, but hanging out is one thing, having sex, that's next level, 'Brina. Are you ready? I'm not sure. I'm nervous. How did you know when you were ready? When I lost my virginity to Jordan Bixby at Bible camp... I was super scared. I didn't know what I was doing. Just that I really liked him. And then, we were alone, and I remember this sensation, like a tingling up my spine. And even though I was scared, my body just sort of took over and knew what to do. You like this Nick guy, huh? He's great. He's really great. Let me ask you. Do you trust him? - I think so. - And he's not pressuring you? No, definitely not. 'Brina... you'll know if you're ready. You'll look at Nick, and you'll know. You looked beautiful at the dance last night. It seemed like you and Harvey were having a great time. Yeah, we were. I'm actually gonna go hang out with him in a bit. Then I should probably head out. Thank you, Roz. And you'll call me tomorrow, - no matter what? - I will. I promise. Cool. Welcome to the final night of the Lupercalia. Hoods hunt wolves, witches hunt warlocks. The outcome of the Hunt shall determine the year ahead. Will it be bountiful or barren? Fruitful or fallow? Tonight, we hunt and are hunted, releasing our blessed magicks into the night. Warlocks, are you ready? And, witches, are you ready? Come on! Dorcas. No fair, sneaking off with the half-breed, not until I've had my turn. Okay. I, um... thought I was coming over so you could show me some of your new drawings. Yeah, that, too. Don't go anywhere. Um... Can I tell you a secret? So I sent some copies of my sketchbook to this art school in Rhode Island. Uh, Tommy made me do it. And they want me to meet some faculty members there for either a summer program or an apprenticeship or a... Harvey. What? What is it? Something... Something's wrong. Everything's dark. What? What do you mean? I can't see. I can't see anything. Nick? Nick? Oh, no. Amalia. You're alive. Uh... Nicholas told me about you. How you were his family, and how... And how lucky he was to have you. And I'm... I'm not your enemy. I'm no threat to you, Amalia. And what you... And what you feel for Nick, I understand it. It's natural. You're not just his familiar. You're so much more than that. We can work this out, I know we can. I know we can. Sabrina. Amalia. Please, don't hurt her. I love her. Why... Why didn't you stay away? Sabrina, run. Nick, I'm not leaving you. But just talk to her. Ergo draco maledicte. Amalia, stop! Stop hurting him! No. Why didn't you kill her? Why'd you lie to me? Because she was your familiar? After my parents died, I didn't have anyone. Amalia kept me alive, Sabrina. Treated me like her own cub. I couldn't put her down. I chained her up in a cave. And I, um... killed another wolf in her place for its heart. Amalia must've gotten free, though. I don't know how. Her love for you gave her strength. I failed you, Sabrina. I was weak. You couldn't kill the only family you had. You loved her. That's not a weakness. That's a virtue. But I lied to you. Sabrina. Shh.
