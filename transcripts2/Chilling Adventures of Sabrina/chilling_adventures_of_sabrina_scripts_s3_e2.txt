 Nick. Nick. Can you hear me? You're at the Academy. You're back home again. Everything's gonna be okay. Nick. Lucifer. Go on. Call me Daddy. You're bound in Damascus steel and circled in salt.

 There's no escape. I wanna talk to Nick. Sabrina? Is it really you? Let me see your tongue. Nice try, Satan, but a forked tongue is a dead giveaway. I wanna talk to the real Nick. Now. Nick. Nick, I am going to get the Dark Lord out of you. I just have to figure out where to put him. Hurry, Sabrina. I can't. I know.

 Just be strong for me, okay? Look, Headmistress. I've made you a little plate of lovely morning biscuits to wish you luck on your first day. Perhaps you'd like to talcum my derriere too, sister. Zelda, I know how you get when you're nervous. Honestly, do you think us incapable of handling the education - of a mere dozen witches and warlocks? - Sorry, us? With Ambrose off trotting around the globe, I'm going to need you more than ever, Hilda. Today, tomorrow, henceforth. The Spellmans are in this together. Yeah. So, I'm actually just gonna go and see Dr. Cee. Come, come. Morning assembly begins in 15 minutes, and we Spellmans don't tolerate tardiness. - Do we? - No. It's a bit early for spell hunting. Cassius, hi. You wouldn't happen to have any grimoires on the subject of soul transference, would you? I'm... writing a short story for school about transferring a soul from one body to another. That's arcane magic. It could take me some time to find. Where shall I deliver the books when I do? Oh, no, uh, just hold them here for me. I, uh, have to go over to my mortal school for a little while. I have a really, really important obligation there. ♪ This speech is my recital ♪ ♪ I think it's very vital ♪ - ♪ It's tricky to rock a rhyme ♪ - ♪ That's right on time ♪ ♪ "It's Tricky" is the title ♪ ♪ It's tricky to rock a rhyme To rock a rhyme that's right on time ♪ ♪ It's tricky ♪ ♪ It's tricky, tricky, tricky ♪ ♪ In New York, the people talk And try to make us rhyme ♪ ♪ They really hawk but we just walk ♪ ♪ Because we have no time ♪ ♪ In the city, it's a pity 'Cause we just can't hide ♪ ♪ Tinted windows don't mean nothin' They know who's inside ♪ ♪ It's tricky to rock a rhyme ♪ ♪ To rock a rhyme that's right on time ♪ ♪ It's tricky ♪ ♪ Tricky, tricky, tricky ♪ ♪ When I wake up people take up Mostly all of my time ♪ ♪ I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'Cause I make up a rhyme ♪ ♪ I'm not bragging, people nagging ♪ ♪ 'Cause they think I'm a star ♪ ♪ Always tearing what I'm wearing I think they've gone too far ♪ ♪ It's tricky to rock a rhyme ♪ - ♪ To rock a rhyme that's right on time ♪ - ♪ It's tricky ♪ - ♪ How is it? ♪ - ♪ Tricky ♪ ♪ Tricky, tricky, tricky ♪ - Forever.

Super excited. Same. Well, catch you later. - Bye. - Yes. I actually am, like, really excited. Me too. Like, for real. I mean, all the insane infernal things going on right now, with Nick, with Hell. It's a relief to do something as normal as... Hello, girls. Hey, Ms. Wardwell. Guess again. Madam Satan. Your Highness and I have business to discuss, but... I'd rather not do it in such a... cheerful setting. Look, if you're here to take Nick back to Hell, - you should... - No, no. I'm here as your regent. To begin your job training. Job training? Doing what, exactly? Why, the Devil's work, of course. Your work now. We're starting light. Today, there are only two souls to drag to Hell. What? I have to drag souls to Hell? No. No way. I'm not condemning anyone to that place. They condemn themselves. You're simply completing transactions your father began. Dragging souls is your primary duty as leader of Hell. And it's vitally important that you carry it out, because the Kings of Hell and their darkly handsome little prince, Caliban, are watching you. And waiting for you to fail. And if you fail, you lose our throne to Caliban. Our throne? Yes. Then he'll declare war on this realm you care so very much for. Now, see here: name, expiration date, time, and place. You'll escort the souls by hand. And the path to Hell will present itself to you in an appropriate fashion. It's all very simple. Robert Robertson. What'd this guy do? It doesn't matter. He sold his soul. You're there to collect, not befriend him. We'll escort you to the first soul, just to get you out the gate. What do you mean, we? He's your muscle, should the need arise. Shall we? For all our searching, my father's blood led us here? To Loch Ness? I'm not surprised Father Blackwood chose to hide here. Loch Ness lies atop a powerful rift along the Earth's ley lines. Aleister Crowley himself once harnessed its energies for his own higher magicks. A magick that could warp the very fabric of time and space. - We should keep our wits about us. - I want blood, Ambrose. And you shall have it, I promise you. Soon. Soon. Many years ago, my late brother, Edward, stood on this very spot and told his students that with hard work and dedication, there was no limit to what they might achieve. Today, I stand before you as Directrix with a message of equal hope. We may be depleted, but we are here. And together, we shall prevail. And now... let us pray. Hail Lilith, full of disgrace. The darkness is with thee. Cursed are you amongst women, and cursed is the fruit of thy womb, demons. Unholy Lilith, mother of night, pray for our sins now, and... Unholy Lilith... mother of night. They dare abandon me. Go. Remind them who their god is. Excuse me? Are you Robert Robertson? I am. You're not who I expected. I imagine you're here for the same reason. Won't you indulge an old man? I'm afraid I'm not very good at chess. Well, that's all right. We're close to the end now. Can I ask? What could have been worth the price of your soul? My heart's desire. To be the greatest chess master in the world. And I was. For a time. Your move. That's it. Checkmate. Game over. Tell me, is Hell really as bad as they say? It's... not so bad. This isn't right. Mr. Robertson. Wait. Not that one. Take the other one. Are you sure? Definitely. Aren't you coming with me? No. I don't think I'd be welcomed where you're headed. But safe travels. You really are the worst. Shame! Heresy! Heresy! You let him go? - Explain yourself, witch. - Well, I... My kings, my kings, I am not surprised you're angered. But may I say as regent, that this was but a silly momentary lapse in judgment. - No, that's not true. I... - The Queen is still learning, but she guarantees that the next soul she collects will burn twice as hot to rekindle the flames of Hell. I would like the Morningstar to speak for herself and explain why she reprieved the mortal. If she pleases. Um... Thank you, Caliban. Well, in the moment, I felt that the man who sold his soul was not worthy of damnation, so instead, I chose to show him mercy. Mercy? Mercy! What blasphemy. Blasphemy. The girl makes a mockery out of our sacred prerogatives. Let Prince Caliban collect the next soul. He'll prove worthy. Indeed, I would relish... such a task. Does my lady charge me so? She does not. Rome wasn't burned in a day. Sabrina has another soul to drag. If I'm not mistaken, a man by the name of Jimmy Platt. And this time she'll get it right. Won't you, Sabrina? Did you just say Jimmy Platt? The distance between the pillars and the length of the sacrilegious nave, the dark transepts and the choir are multiples of the profane mean. So, if angle A-B-C is equal... Who did this? Who did this? Answer me. All right, then, go. Get out of my classroom. I don't have time for such insolent behavior. Go, I said! You're dismissed. ♪ 'Cause I'm just A teenage dirtbag, baby ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm just A teenage dirtbag, baby ♪ ♪ Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me ♪ ♪ Her boyfriend's a dick ♪ ♪ He lives on my block ♪ ♪ And he drives an IROC ♪ ♪ But he doesn't know who I am ♪ ♪ And he doesn't give a damn about me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm just A teenage dirtbag, baby ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby ♪ ♪ Listen to Iron... ♪ Guys! Guys! Crisis Fright Club meeting. Now. So, dragging souls to Hell is like, what, your after-school job? Uh, kind of. But surprisingly, that's not even the weirdest part. Look who's up next. Jimmy Platt. - Wait. - The Jelly Frost ice cream guy? The smiley guy in the truck? I know. Crazy, right? What did he do that was so bad? I don't know. They don't tell me. They don't tell you? Well, then, how do you know they deserve it? Well, I'm gonna have to figure it out on a case-by-case basis. But the thing is, dragging Jimmy to Hell, assuming he deserves it, could be the key to saving Nick. But I need your help. When I do drag Jimmy's soul to the very bad place, it'll leave behind his freshly dead body, which, if we move fast enough, so there's not much decay, we can use as a new prison for the Dark Lord. Instead of Nick's body. So, it's like Freaky Friday. It's called a soul transference, but kind of. So, if you follow me in the Spellman mortuary hearse, once I get Mr. Platt's soul out... We can go body-snatch his body. Okay, fine, but I'm driving. Wait, why do you always get to drive? I'm the only one of us who has a license, Theo. - Wait, what about the pep rally? - It shouldn't take long. I mean, we know where he parks. We just have to go and do it. Are you sure about this? What if someone catches us? You mean like your girlfriend, Dorcas? Relax. No one's been down here in weeks. What was that? It felt like something fell on my hair, like a bug or something. Now who needs to relax? They called me a bitch. Me. They probably meant that ironically. Would any of them have ever called Faustus a bitch? No. - No. - And he was a little bitch. He was a bit of a bitch, wasn't he? - Ms. Spellman. - What? Melvin? What... happened? It's Elspeth. She hath come undone. She tried to kill me. This is nuts. We're in high school. We should be worried about midterms, not... not dragging the friendly neighborhood ice cream man to Hell. Let's just stick to the plan. We can freak out later. Now, when you see me walking away, you probably won't see his soul, but his body should slump dead, which is when you guys rush out, and... - Steal the corpse. - Steal the corpse, yeah. Well, hello there. You got a Jolly Frost flavor in mind today? Hi, Jimmy. Mr. Platt. I'm here to collect you. Well, now, you're not the gentleman I made my agreement with. No. I'm new. Huh. Well, I've got my extension fee all lined up for you, as usual. Extension fee? Yes. Extension of my contract. Seven more years of life in exchange for an innocent soul. As soon as I finish my shift, we can go, and I'll cut her little heart out and eat it. What? Are you talking about sacrificing a child? You betcha. Doesn't get more innocent than a little girl. Oh, golly, you truly have no idea what you're doing, do you? Why don't you run along and go check with your boss and get back to me, okay? I am the boss. And I brought backup. Well, now, you might wanna keep your distance, big fella. Both of you. 'Cause that little darlin' I have waiting for you, no one knows where she is but me. So, if you or your friend here try to take me to Hell, she dies. She starves to death. Or worse. So, you can either accept my payment for the extension, or you can piss off. Either way, it's your choice. - Ice cream! - Well, hello there. You guys have a Jolly Frost flavor in mind today? - Chocolate ice cream! - Yes. Four chocolate cones coming right up. What happened? I don't know. But he tried to offer me a child in exchange for an extension to his contract. As if my horrible father has made that sort of deal with him before. I can't drag him to hell, because he's keeping a little girl trapped somewhere in Greendale. We... we have to find her. Oh, we're going to. And then I will personally burn Jimmy Platt's pitch-black soul in Hell myself. But first, I gotta talk to the old boss. What's the deal with Jimmy Platt? Jimmy, yeah. He's a character. Devoutly pious, or he was until he got into a horrendous car crash a very long time ago. Mangled and dying, he cried out to his false god. "Save me. Save me." Only I got there first. I offered him the simple standard deal: another seven years for his soul. He agreed. They always do. And have you been giving him extensions? After seven years, I came to collect, but he begged for more time. So, I told him the price. A child's soul. An innocent soul. I never said it had to be a child. That was his predilection. You turned him into a murderer. No, he was one. Well, I'm not issuing any more extensions. Then don't. You're Queen. - Drag him to Hell. - I can't. He's got a little girl tied up somewhere. Suit yourself, but if you don't bring Jimmy Platt to heel, then you will lose your throne as surely as I'm sitting here. And Caliban has all of Hell backing him, and he plans to expand into this realm. Do your job! Or unchain me, so I can do it. Ambrose, look there. It's him. - Earth and Hell, it's him. - Wait. Wait, wait. Look, he's in the middle of some sort of ritual. Perhaps it's a summoning ritual. But summoning what? I call upon the watery guardians of the west. Place of endings, of the coming darkness. I cast out the Devouring Worm, meal of the Deep One. And offer unto thee a fresh feast of witches' blood, if you rise. Rise, Deep One, and feed! What is that? Deep One, welcome. Thank you. You shall have your payment presently. Come out, my sacrifices. Sacrifices? Wait, no. No, he means to slaughter them. One of us should save the children, whilst the other one of us... Oh, for Lucifer's sake. Hello, daughter. Found me at last, eh? Are you okay? Are you okay? Hel... For your troubles, I'll kill you and bury you in the sand. You know, I don't believe that you will. No. Put it... put it down. Put it down! You have no idea of the annihilation that's capable of. What is it? I've spent 15 years inside a temporal church of my own creation, purifying myself to wield magics you couldn't possibly fathom. All for my prize. Fifteen years? You've been gone a month. For you a month, for me here 15 glorious years. These are more of your lies. Can you not feel it, Prudence? The Dark Lord dethroned, the pits of the abyss unmanned. The old ones are returning to claim the Earth. And then... the eldritch terrors. Return to me the egg, and we'll bear witness to the birth of the unspeakable. Together, we can... Harvey and I went to the police station. We found a bulletin board of all the missing persons. This girl disappeared from a playground three days ago. She's so young. Can you see where she is with your cunning? Not off a flyer, but if I had something of hers. Something she's touched. If I could hold it in my hands, - I could... - Hey, Sabrina. Hey, Roz. Hi, Sabrina. - Hey, Lizzie. - Hey, girls. We're going to the mall to get our nails and hair done before the pep rally. It's a cheer tradition. Oh, man, Roz and I can't. We've, um... Sabrina's taking me to the doctor for a check-up. It's for my eyes. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Thoughts and prayers, of course. But we'll see you at the rally, right? We need your mad skills. Oh, most definitely. We will totes be there. See you then. Are you gonna drive or what? I can't believe we're ditching the cool kids to play cat and mouse with a serial killer. - Well, what choice do we have? - None. So, what's the plan? Are we gonna find this guy, kidnap him? Well, actually, I appreciate the gusto, Harvey, but I think for this next step, it might be a little less suspicious if it's just me and Roz. Excuse me, are you Lucy Anderson's mother? When we first heard about how Lucy went missing, we... we just wanted to help. I am so sorry about your daughter. The police have no leads. How could she just disappear without a trace? She's still alive. She has to be. Mrs. Anderson, do you have any pictures of Lucy that we could borrow to make flyers and help get the word out? Or, actually, could you tell us about these? Lucy collects pinwheels. She had one with her when... when she... I'll see if I can find you a picture. - Well, hello. - May I please have a chocolate pop? I found one. This was taken last spring. We're going to find Lucy and bring her home, Mrs. Anderson. And the man who took her will be condemned to Hell and tortured there for all eternity. Oh. Well, thank you. That's... You wouldn't mind if we took one of Lucy's pinwheels with us, would you? No... you wouldn't mind at all. I wouldn't mind at all. You should get some rest. - Forget we ever came here. - Forget you ever came here. Sorry. You okay? I'm so sorry. I wasn't looking where I was going. Yeah, it's no biggie. Here you go. Oh. I'm Theo Putnam. Robin. Uh... I just started here. I don't know where my locker is. Any ideas? Um... Yeah, I think you're over this way. So, where'd you move from? It's just some tiny boring town. Oh, if there's one thing about Greendale, it is not boring. Amazing. Yup. - Thank you. - No problem. Hey, wait. Are you... I heard there's a pep rally going on later. Are you gonna go? We circumnavigated the world to find and execute Blackwood. Do not tell me that your resolve is softened. No, but what was he doing here? And all of that talk of the old ones and the eldritch terrors. - We need to find out. - What are you proposing, Ambrose? We take him and the egg back to Greendale. There, we will interrogate your father, and then he can pay for his crimes in front of the entire Church of Night. No. I want justice now. He should be dead already. - Please don't kill him. - Don't kill our father. Please. Judas? Leticia? My name is Judith. Higher magicks of time and space. Agatha. What are you doing? Nothing, Lady Blackwood. Stop that at once. Stop what, Lady Blackwood? - Don't call me that. - Or you'll what, Lady Blackwood? I'm not Lady Blackwood. That's right. You're a bitch! Zelda Phiona Spellman. What has got into you? I've no idea. It's called a whispering gallery spell. Like when you're standing under a dome, and you whisper something into a wall, and your voice travels somewhere else. If Lucy still has her pinwheel, I might be able to. Audi vocem meu. Audi vocem meu. Audi vocem meu. Audi vocem meu. Hello? Lucy? Are... are you there? Hello? Who... who is that? A friend. I'm trying to help you, Lucy, but first, you have to tell me, is there a man with you? No, he said he'd come back, but it's been a while. Can you call my mom to come and get me? Can you see where you are? It's a big refrigerator. It's a freezer. He's got her in a freezer. Okay. Okay, Lucy, can you read anything in the refrigerator that tells you where you are, so I can find you? Uh-uh. Are you close? I'm getting really sleepy. No. Lucy, don't fall asleep. I'm coming. I'll be right there. Lanuae magicae. Lanuae magicae. - Sabrina, what are you doing? - Lanuae magicae. Lanuae magicae. Maybe I can teleport, using her voice as a beacon. Sabrina, you don't know where she is. What if it's somewhere dangerous? It's like Harvey said, Roz, we don't have a choice. Lanuae magicae. Lanuae magicae. Brina, I don't like this. You're going in blind. I seek this child, cold and bound. - What is lost must now be found. - 'Brina! Lucy, wake up. Lucy, wake up. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna get you home. I'm gonna... Get you out of here? Well, now, has anyone ever told you you're a dumb pudding? For instance, did you know that some sigils are one way? You can zap yourself into them, but you can't zap yourself out. Lanuae magicae. Oh, no. Oh, yes. You're trapped. Lickety splickety. Like my friend Lucy there. Don't worry. I'll be back when you're frozen through and through. There's a pep rally at the high school. I bet I get a lot of customers tonight. I hate pointing out that the novice Queen is running out of time. You'll learn. Caliban, was it? Sabrina may be intractable, infuriating, and naive, but she is a Morningstar in her bones. And she will deliver the soul to us, as dictated by the Book of the Beast. Now, while we're waiting, may I offer you gentlemen... some refreshments? Minion, help me fetch our guests something to drink. - Useless wench. - Something to get them in a stupor. Feel free to add your own piss and bile to the concoction. Meanwhile, I'll see where our wayward Queen has gotten herself to this time. There we go. Nice cup of tranquility tea. Calm you right down. Thank you, Hildy. With some cream? Oh, some cream. Striking a student. Never in my life. I slapped Agatha before I even knew what I was doing. Ah, we've all wanted to slap Agatha. What's happening to us? We're coming apart. Oh, I know. Oh! Eugh. Oh, that cream was fresh this morning. Curdled cream in a witch's cup. It can only mean one thing. The Devil's afoot. Well, it can't be. The Dark Lord is in Hell trapped inside Nicholas. Isn't he? What? Mistress Spellman? What's Elspeth done now? Agatha found this in her hair. That beetle is telltale. The Dark Lord is here somewhere. Zelda? What? Don't move. You didn't strike Agatha. He did. This is all his influence. Search the Academy, but go in pairs. Do not go off alone. And if you should find, or even sense, the Dark Lord's presence, do not engage with him. And remember, the second the flame flickers blue, you rush back here to us. Lucy. Lucy, no. We have to stay awake until... Ball of fire, ball of flame, gather for me bright and plain. It's no use. We're doomed. Unless... Hello? Who is it? Roz? No, it's me, Your Majesty. And it's true what they say: a regent's work is never done. Lilith? How'd you find me? Well, I found Miss Walker. She filled me in on your antics, and then it was just a matter of picking up your psychic trail. I leave behind a psychic trail? Like a slug leaves slime. Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Wake up. We're gonna get you home. Do you think perhaps you wouldn't have found yourself trapped in a walk-in freezer if you'd simply done what was asked of you? Instead of dithering around with your friends? I was trying to find a way to use Jimmy Platt to save Nick. Of course, it's about a boy. Sabrina, you're out of time. Well, then, help me. I have to get Lucy back to her parents. I'll see to the girl, but would you please do your damn job as a Morningstar? Count on it. I believe this is yours. Lucy. Wait. Who are you? Who am I? Why, I'm Mary Wardwell. I teach at Baxter High. Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go! Can I ask you, Robin, did the ice cream guy say anything weird to you at all? No. Why would he? No reason. Why don't we just arrest him? Or, like, beat the shit out of him? Remember what Sabrina said: you and Theo are back up, I'm part of the distraction. This is so messed up. Sabrina almost froze to death. I know. But she's got this. Roz. Hey, Roz. Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go!

A chocolate pop, please. Coming right up. I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream. Right, Mr. Platt? You again. How did you get out of the freezer? A friend found me. And Lucy's safe, so no more threats, Jimmy. My deal was with the Dark Lord. Yes, but Hell's under new management now. Mine! Help! Help! You're going to pay for your crimes, Mr. Platt. For a very long time. Burn this trash, won't you, Lilith? And feel free to get creative with his suffering. Thy wish is our command, Queen, but I'm not sure how much use you'll get from his body once I'm through. I'll find another one. Somehow. This proves nothing. A single soul. The child cannot rule. I'm not here to get your blessing. I accepted my birthright to keep Hell where it belongs, away from the mortal realm. But that's not enough. The old ways, my father's ways, are broken. Hell needs a makeover, fellas. How dare you speak to us this way? I'll speak however I please. You forget yourself, Beelzebub. I'm your sovereign. And the reformation of Hell starts now. Aunties... I'm home. - What's for dinner? - Finally. Well, do you care to explain yourself? Oh, I'm sorry I missed your first day at the Academy. I had this problem. How many secrets are you keeping from us? You didn't happen to go to Hell and bring back your father, the Dark Lord, and stick him in the bowels of the Academy without telling us, did you? Putting what's left of the coven, not to mention the entire world, in grave peril, just so you can see your boyfriend. - That's not why I did it. - Oh, I know why you did it. Cassius delivered a stack of books with rituals about soul transference. I thought the Dark Lord was bad. I thought he was dangerous, but Lilith preserve us from his demented lovesick daughter. I couldn't just leave Nick in Hell. Every second he was down there, he was in torment. Aunties, every second he was in pain. We know, darling. And it's my fault. He did it for me. I couldn't just wash my hands of him. I owed it to Nick to at least try and get Lucifer out of his body - and into someone else's. - Whose? Where do you expect to find another vessel strong enough to withstand being turned into a flesh Acheron for the Devil himself? Aunties. I'm home. Any chance of a cuppa? You were saying, Auntie Zee? Sorry, who are the tied-up children? Something's different about you. I dragged my first soul to Hell today. And how did that make you feel, all that power? All that rage? Like I'm capable of anything. That's my girl. Even this. Meet your new jailer. Blackwood. Oh, that's right. You two know each other. That makes the soul transference a little easier, doesn't it, Aunt Zee? Hmm... Still painful, I'm afraid. This, Judith and Judas, will be your room. You will be safe here with lots of fun toys to play with and plenty of books to read. And don't worry, my dear siblings, we will be checking in on you from time to time. They won't starve, will they? It's a living doll spell. They won't realize the passing of days, nor feel hunger, nor pain. And the egg? We wait and see what hatches. In the meantime... Don't suppose you're looking to wrestle, are you, Faustus? Wrestle? I've seen beyond the veil of this world, oh, mighty Satan. I know there are powers more vast and cosmic than a single vainglorious fallen angel. Do you mean the old gods? What, the pagan monsters who believe themselves deities? No. No. I speak of the eldritch terrors, Lord Lucifer. Older than the oldest gods. Nick, it's okay. It's okay. You're home again. Sabrina. Is it really you? It is. It is me. Why are you crying? It's kinda weird to say, especially after all the craziness, but... you were amazing tonight at the pep rally. Really? Do you think cheerleading suits me? Everything suits you. Do you hear that? You mean the wind? Harvey. I've seen beyond the veil of this world. The old ones are returning to claim the Earth.
