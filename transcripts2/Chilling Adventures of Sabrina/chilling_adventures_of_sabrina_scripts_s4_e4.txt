 [theme music playing] [bats' wings flapping] [thunder claps] [crows cawing] [thunder claps] [leaves rustling] [bats screeching] [Sabrina] Friends, citizens of Baxter High, in these fraught, divisive times, I ask you, what would make this a better school, a stronger community?

 How about unity or empathy… for each other? Inclusivity, a place where everyone belongs, where our differences are celebrated and bring us together. A vote for Sabrina Spellman and Rosalind Walker - is a vote for voice, your voice. - [meows] You will have one, and it will be heard. Thank you. - Yay! - [chuckles] [Zelda] Hmm. So, student council president. That's very exciting, isn't it? [giggles] What'd you think of my speech, Aunt Zee? Truth be told, I sensed a lack of authenticity and identity behind your words. Well, it's hard to be 100 percent authentic

 when you're still trying to figure out who or what you are. All the more reason for you to pull out of this juvenile election. - Besides, whenever will you find the time? - I will make the time. - [Cerberus] There you are. - Thanks. This is important to me and Roz. Important? No, what's important is protecting the world from the eldritch terrors. That's important. Maybe, but I can't exactly put "vanquisher of the eldritch terrors" on my application to Vassar. That is assuming there is still a Vassar in the days to come. Sabrina, Aunt Zelda is right. The dangers posed by the eldritch terrors are far from over. I understand. Sometimes it feels like all we talk about is the eldritch terrors. I also don't like the idea of you distracting Rosalind from her duties as Sentinel. - There are three Sentinels, Aunt Zee. - [Marie] Hmm. Speaking of Rosalind, has she told young Harvey yet about, you know, that she's a witch? No. I think that's happening tonight. Harvey… talk to me. What do you want me to say? I'm in shock, Roz. You told me point-blank you weren't a witch. I... I didn't think that I was. - It's just a word. - It's more than a word, Roz. It's what you are. It's one of the things that I am. You said that you were a... a Sentinel. What does that mean? It means I'm a seer. I can see things that other people can't. Should I go home? No. No, I want you here with me. I'm sorry. I'm trying. I know. I know. [sighs] You're okay. We'll be okay. [upbeat rock song playing] Vote for Spellman-Walker. ♪ I hear you purring all around ♪ ♪ I know I shouldn't be here ♪ ♪ I shouldn't be with you anywhere ♪ ♪ While your black magic draws me back For the last time ♪ ♪ Yes, your black... ♪ [Harvey sighs] Seriously, Theo, why does every girl I fall in love with turn out to be a witch? Maybe you've got a type. I could ask Robin if he knows any lady hobgoblins. Oh, by the way, did you guys see Billy and Carl's campaign poster? Give me a break. "Bros for brotherhood." [laughing] It's lame. Hey, how's your schedule gonna work, Roz? You know, splitting your time between being co-president and a... a Sentinel. I'll figure it out. After all, I have the unconditional support of my friends and my boyfriend. Right? I gotta go. I'm gonna go… get some air. [teacup rattling] [rumbling] [bells on door jingle] [wind howling] Good day to you, friend. I hope I'm not intruding. I come bearing wares… of superb and sublime quality for the collector of rare trinkets. Please, trinket man, come inside. You've found an eager buyer. An array of delightfully dangerous items, not for the feeble-minded. For instance... the Stone of Omphalos, recovered from the ruins of ancient Greece. My interests run far more ancient than that, my friend. I seek items of a more… eldritch nature. Items more akin to this one. Could this be the Imp of the Perverse, one of my beloved eldritch terrors? It's said that the Imp bestows upon its owner any wish, the power to warp and pervert reality itself. I'm afraid it's not for sale. [rumbling] [gasps] [Faustus] One of my beloved eldritch terrors. Oh, Father, what madness are you unleashing now, and where? Sisters, Sentinels, hear me. Help me to focus my sight. [shakily] The next eldritch terror is here. Roz? What is it? What's going on? [panting] It's Prudence. She's sensing an eldritch terror. My father's taken it from some... some trinket salesman. He's… He's stealing it, throwing the man out of... Where? Where is the eldritch terror? Where's the terror, Prudence? No, I won't tell you that. You might try to stop me. [Roz] Stop you from what? From killing my father as I should have long ago. Here me, Imp, and pervert the world. Make me emperor. [casts spell in Latin] And make it so that I've always been emperor. [screams] [loud ringing] [grunting] - [ringing continues] - [crying out in pain] [Sabrina and Roz wincing] [ringing fades] [water running] - [faucet turns] - [water stops] [shouting in distance] [exhales] Judith. Why is Mad Agatha not dressed to go out? [Agatha muttering] It is Emperor Blackwood's birthday, and we do not want to anger him. Father said Mad Agatha can stay home today so as not to upset the schoolchildren on our visits. That's fine then. Judas, fetch father's imp. Judith, has Anubis been fed? Yes, Lieutenant. Hm. Sabrina, what happened? - What is happening? - I have no clue. Oh no. [Roz] Sabrina? What? What the heaven? Oh, Roz, our buttons. Praise Blackwood. What are you looking at? Nothing. Praise Blackwood. Blackwood High? [Roz] Wait. Wait. Wait. Prudence said something about her father right before… whatever happened. She said that he'd gotten hold of an eldritch terror, and she was on her way to kill him. [Harvey] Can I see your hall passes? Uh-oh. Hey, babe. Who's this? This is my friend… S... Samantha. Hi, I'm Samantha. Samantha's visiting from her other school. Cool. Welcome to Blackwood High. [door creaks open] [door closes] - [Ms. Wardwell clears throat] - [students] Good morning, Ms. Wardwell. Class... we'll begin as we always do, with the Pledge of Allegiance. Who will lead us today? Cadet Kinkle. [Harvey clears throat] We pledge allegiance to Faustus Blackwood, the supreme emperor of Greendale. We swear to render unconditional obedience to him and to be ready at all times to sacrifice our lives for him. Praise Blackwood. [students] Praise Blackwood. [Ms. Wardwell] Now, today, students, we will be looking back at two of the greatest moments in American history. Now, I'm speaking, of course, of the Salem and Greendale witch trials, when righteousness and godliness triumphed over the darkest, most pernicious foes imaginable... witches. Now, who can tell me why are witches so bad for the world? Because they kill babies and eat their flesh and drink their blood. Correct. Now, class, as you know, witches are trying to ascend, and it's solely thanks to the efforts of Emperor Blackwood that the babes of this great nation are safe in their cribs. I am reminding you of all of this because Emperor Blackwood is known to quiz students on important history... in person. Wait, Emperor Blackwood is coming here to see us? That's right, Cadet Marlin. Today is Emperor Blackwood's birthday, the one day of the year he traditionally visits Greendale school. [shouting in distance] In fact, I believe I can hear him in the hall. [footsteps approaching] [Anubis growling] [students] Happy birthday, Emperor Blackwood. Why, thank you, children. What a very warm welcome. Now… please sit down. I'm sorry to be conducting business on my birthday, but it's come to my attention that there is a witch amongst you… trying to pass as mortal. Robin Goodfellow, you are accused of being a witch. [snarling] What? That... That's not true. I'm not a witch. But you have a witch's green hair and a witch's pointy ears. That's bullshit! Robin isn't a witch. Enough dithering. Arrest the witch, Lieutenant. [whispering] Run. Go. Get out of here. [boy 1] Whoa! [boy 2] Did you see that? [students whispering] Children, I'm afraid there's been a mistake. The witch wasn't Mr. Goodfellow. The witch is Mr. Putnam. Arrest him, please. No. Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? Let go of me! This is crazy! Let go of me! Where are you taking me? [door slams] Now, Ms. Wardwell, where were we? Well, we were just discussing the threat that witches pose to us, Emperor. Oh yes. The threat of witches is real and omnipresent. Witches fly overhead riding their broomsticks, and they can drop their spell bombs on any house, school, hospital, or nursery at any moment. Now one more thing before I leave you. You've all seen witches masquerading as mortals. And have you ever seen a witch's true self? [students gasping] [screaming] Yes, yes, that's quite enough of that. Filthy creature. [girl] Disgusting! I think a round of applause for Emperor and his... pet witch. [Roz, whispering] Okay, that was completely insane. Are we in a parallel Greendale? I don't know. But you remember Prudence saying something about an eldritch terror - right before the world warped, right? - Yeah. What if this is the eldritch terror? Ambrose said that one of them was the Perverse. What if we're not living in a parallel universe but a perverted one, one where Blackwood's emperor, I'm public enemy number one, and everyone else is in some kind of trance? Except not us. Why? Why aren't we affected? Maybe we're immune. We've both had contact with an eldritch terror. I've had the Weird inside me. You touched the Uninvited. What if that contact... immunized us? Like getting a flu shot? Maybe. I'm no expert, but Ambrose is. Let's go to my house. We'll see if he can make sense of this nightmare. Okay. [crows cawing] You there! Ambrose. - Go away. - [Sabrina] What? Ambrose, thank Hecate. Get away from me, woman. Woman? Ambrose, I'm your cousin. I lived with you in that house, our house, for years. I haven't the slightest inkling of who you are. I do not have a cousin. I've never had a cousin. [spluttering] What are you doing? Where are you going? I am getting the bloody hell out of Dodge. Can't you see that I have been marked? Marked? On the door? I've been formally accused of witchcraft, which is patently false. But don't you remember who you are? Ambrose, you are a witch. - You are a master of the mystic arts. - No, no, no, I am not. Ambrose, listen to me. We are fighting the eldritch terrors. This is one of them, the Perverse, and we're trapped in it. No. Not me, because I am leaving. I do not know what lies beyond the town's borders. The outer world could be overrun with witches, by the plague, by dragons, and by war, as Blackwood says it is, or it could be nothing at all. But whatever it is, I am gonna see it for myself. - [car door slams] - [car engine starts] Well, now what? [spluttering] I... We'll go to the Academy. [sighs] If anyone knows what's real and what's not, it would be my Aunt Zelda. Brina, this… this might not work, but I wanna talk to Harvey. I need to try to bring him back to who he was, who he is. I get it. We'll keep in touch using my magic marker. And please, Roz, be safe. Okay, you too. [soft piano music playing] - Oh, sorry. - Sorry. I... Are you new here? Maybe. I'm just checking out the place first. That makes sense. Uh, Madam Spellman's used to be the best art school in the state. Uh, what's your name? Samantha… Stillwell. Nick Scratch. - Do you know where you're going? - Yeah. I, uh, have an appointment with Madam Spellman in her, uh, office. Well, uh, I hope you do end up going here. Might liven up the place a bit. [door creaks open] Aunt Zelda? I'm Zelda Spellman. Who are you? Aunt Zee, I'm your niece, Sabrina. I don't have a niece. What is this? Aunt Zee, you know me. [sighs] You fed me. You gave me baths. You nursed me when I was sick. You presented me at my Dark Baptism. Your what? I did no such thing. Aunt Zee, please remember me. [sighs] [breathes deeply] [soft mystical chiming] God in heaven. - It's you. - Yes, it's me. Public enemy number one. You're wanted by the state. If the emperor finds you here… We've defeated Blackwood before, and we can do it again. You just need to remember who I am and who you are. We are witches. We are powerful witches. You're the High Priestess of the Order of Hecate. Get out of my school. [yells] Out! Bless her mind, and bless her heart, return her memories from the start. Sabrina. Zelda, he's here. The emperor is in the grand… hall. Wait. Wait. I should turn you over to the emperor, but that will make more for trouble us. Stay here... and don't make a sound. [sighs] [door closes] Emperor, you grace us with a visit on your birthday. Sadly, my spies have once again heard troublesome rumors about this school. Madam Spellman, are you in possession of any art or literature that would be in violation of state decency laws? We have no such books or art here. What about babies? There have been reports of cries in the night. No babies. Although we have been practicing at night a song, one of your favorites. Marie, would you do the honors? ["Tomorrow Belongs to Me" playing on accordion] ♪ Now Fatherland, Fatherland Show us the sign ♪ ♪ Your children have waited to see ♪ ♪ The morning will come When the world is mine ♪ ♪ Tomorrow belongs ♪ ♪ Tomorrow belongs ♪ ♪ Tomorrow belongs to me ♪ Beloved Emperor, does our choir please you? Hm. No… it does not. You… You weren't singing with the rest of the choir. For why, boy? I guess I must have forgotten the words. [sighs] Once a bad boy, always a bad boy. Nicholas, apologize to the emperor at once. No. No need to apologize. But he may sing for me… alone. Nicholas, please. Very well. Prudence. ♪ The babe in his cradle Is closing his eyes ♪ ♪ The blossom embraces the bee ♪ ♪ But soon there's a whisper ♪ ♪ Arise, arise ♪ ♪ Tomorrow belongs to me ♪ [sighs] Very good. Well sung, boy. Now search the place. Leave no stone unturned. We're looking for babies… and degenerate art. Is everything okay, Rosalind? You seem upset. Different. No, Harvey. You're the one who's different. But I know you're in there somewhere. You have to be. What are you talking about? What are you doing in Blackwood's army? Serving the emperor… and hopefully making you proud. You think I should be proud that you arrested Theo, our friend, and sent him God knows where? You heard the emperor. Theo's a witch. No, he isn't. He's a teenager. But I am a witch. So what? Are you gonna arrest me now too? Of course not. But you can't say things like that. Listen to me, Harvey. I am a witch. And Blackwood, Blackwood is a warlock. That's enough, Roz. But he is a witch, and you, Harvey, you're no stranger to witches. You've dated two of them. Me and Sabrina Spe... Keep your mouth shut, Rosalind Walker! Do you hear me? Never say those words again, or I will arrest you myself. Nod if you understand. [Roz breathing heavily] Good. You should go. Gladly. [Roz breathes shakily] I want you to remember something... that you were a good man, Harvey Kinkle. That you loved your friends, and you protected them. We hunted monsters together. We were in a band called the Fright Club. You lost your virginity to me. And afterwards, I laid on your chest, and we talked until the sun came up. You loved me for who I was... all of me. And whoever this person is that I'm looking at right now, this isn't you. Emperor, we found and confiscated these degenerate items. Indeed. Take them and burn them. - [whimpers] - [Faustus] And one more thing, Lieutenant, arrest that witch. Oh no. - No, Emperor, please. - That's all right, Madam Spellman. I'm not afraid, and I won't beg. No, but you will, witch. With your dying breath, you'll beg for mercy. And none will be given. [door closes] - [indistinct whispers] - [Sabrina] Nick won't die. I won't let that happen. I promise. We can fix this. I need you to wake up from this nightmare and remember you are powerful witches. You're a coven of witches. Stop it! Leave this place and never come back. You had a dog, Aunt Zee... a familiar... named Vinegar Tom. He was a wise beagle. You called him your soul mate. You loved him so much that after he died, you had him stuffed. And you pet him every day. And sometimes, the fact that he's gone makes you cry. Take this. Go to the bookstore on Main Street, request that book. The people there may be able to help you or not. [man on radio] Citizens of Greendale, we are under threat level crimson tonight, as the witches… ...their spell bombing campaign, devastating the surrounding counties… Enough agonizing, Ambrose. You can't sit here all night. [exhales deeply] Here goes nothing. [man on radio] …is reporting record deaths from starvation. [loud screeching] [tires screeching] I am Ambrose Spellman, master of the mystic arts. Praise Hecate. I remember. Do you now? Hello, friend. Who might you be? I am the trinket man, purveyor of occult trinkets. Behold. Tell me, trinket man, have you been to Greendale yet? [chuckling] I'm afraid I have, yes. A madman stole one of my trinkets, the Imp of the Perverse. Perverse. That would have been Father Blackwood, fiddling with eldritch terrors once again. He must have wished upon the Imp to reshape the universe in his image, and now nobody can remember the truth. So why does his wish not extend beyond the borders of Greendale? The Imp still has his… impish ways. My... my family are back there. Sabrina. You don't have another imp that I could wish upon, do you? There's only one Imp of the Perverse. But might I interest you in the sacred Stone of Omphalos? The one from the Greek myth? The same one that Cronus swallowed, creating the center of the universe? By all that is unholy, that... [laughs] That stone isn't the center of reality. That is the stone of reality. That is correct. Therefore, could it restore reality? I don't see why not. But you'd have to be clever with how you went about it. How much for the... How much for the stone? For you? Ah... No, it's free. There's one, uh, problem I foresee. The moment you go across the border, your mind will pervert again. You'll have perhaps 30 seconds of lucidity before the madman's warping wish takes effect again. All right. Uh... [chuckles] I could... I could teleport in. I need to find a way of locating Sabrina, and quickly, so I can give her the stone, and I can tell her how to use it. But how? [Ambrose panting] Maybe I can help with that? Samantha. Roz. [sighs] How's Harvey? Just on a crazy power trip. How's your Aunt Zelda? [sighs] I almost got through to her, but no, she's still drinking the Kool-Aid. Praise Blackwood. May I help you? Praise Blackwood. I'm afraid we've run out of cake because of the sugar rations, but can I get you a nice warming cup of tea? Mm. Actually, I'm... I'm looking for a book. I'm looking for Häxan. Zelda Spellman recommended it to me. Uh... I, uh... I think I have... [inhales] I think I have the book in the back. Follow me, please. Thank you. Welcome to the resistance. We're a small bunch of dissenters holding the line and plotting against the tyranny of Emperor Blackwood. We've been meeting in secret for some time now. Can those two be trusted? They were sent by Zelda Spellman. Sabrina? Is that really you? Agatha, you... you recognize me? Of course, despite your bad dye job. [laughs] Thank the Goddess. But how? Why? Father Blackwood got his hands on the Imp of the Perverse and wished upon it to become Emperor Supreme. Okay, but last I heard, weren't you insane? I was, yes, but when Blackwood cast the spell, my mind was somehow unwarped, and… I remembered everything. And Blackwood doesn't know you're sane? - No. - So you're basically a double agent. Yes, but, Sabrina, it's not safe here. I mean, not for any of us, but especially not for you. Blackwood is obsessed with finding you and executing you so that you can't topple his empire. We have to stop him. End his reign of terror once and for all. Blackwood bears the Mark of Cain. He can't be killed. The only way to reverse this nightmare is to destroy the Imp itself. So Blackwood's omnipotent, he's immortal, and no one remembers they have magical powers? Except me. [people gasping] And us, for the next 25 seconds. Ambrose, Robin, you know who you are? Yes, but that will soon fade, so you must listen very carefully. Take this stone. It is the Stone of Omphalos. The same stone that Cronus, the Greek Titan, swallowed, creating the center of the universe, the center of reality. Using it a certain way, you can awaken people from this warping spell. Okay, use how? In what way? It took us a minute, but once we figured it out, it was so obvious, so simple. All you, um... All you have to do is, uh, uh... [hesitating] I'm sorry. I'm losing my train of thought. What... What was I on about? Ambrose. Ambrose! What, woman? What? Oh, bless it. Why does that keep happening to me? Could we perhaps eat the stone? - What? - What? Well, I mean, he said it was obvious, didn't he? Well, all right then, why don't we do what Cronus did and eat the stone? Cronus was a Titan. We can't exactly eat rocks. Well, no, but I could make it into a stone soup. You know, like in folklore. [chuckles] Aunt Hilda, you're a genius. Yes, I am a genius. Sorry, am I your aunt? You know, let's make the stone soup and see what happens. Put a little lemon and ginger in it. See how it tastes. [soft mystical chiming] Sabrina. Ambrose. [sighs] Stone soup for everyone! [Sabrina] T he plan is simple. We destroy the Imp of the Perverse, and we save everyone. - And how do you go about finding the Imp? - You don't. It comes to you. I mean, at Dorian's, Blackwood keeps it under lock and key. When he's out and about, he travels with it. Our best bet is to destroy it tomorrow at the executions. Executions? I thought it was his birthday party. It is. He celebrates his birthday by executing witches. Okay, then we'll take him out tomorrow before anyone's executed. I'll create a distraction. I'm good at that. And I'll blast the Imp with my wand, which Robin and I will retrieve from the mortuary. I'll head back to Dorian's. I'll bring Aunt Hilda's stone soup to the Academy. Should things go sideways, we'll need as many woke witches as possible. You again. Yeah, me again. Gather all your students, Aunt Zee. You're about to get served a steaming hot cup of reality. Officers… uh, can I help, or are you just browsing? We received a call about your establishment and subversive meetings taking place. Here? No, I can assure you that there's no such thing happening, - is there, Dr. Cee? - Absolutely not. And we pay taxes to the emperor just like everyone else. Search the place. I'll do the front. You do the back. Actually, there's nothing there. - It's just storage. - [Cerberus] Not again. Please. You... you don't have to do this. - [objects clattering] - [Cerberus] Look, you know us. You know us. We've got nothing to hide. Why are you… [Hilda] No. I mean, there's nothing there. Please, Harvey, you don't have to do this. Anyone back there? We got reports there were dissidents here. Blackwood will get suspicious if we come back empty-handed. Kinkle, did you find anyone? Seriously? Your girlfriend? She was the only one back there. Jeez, you never really can tell, can you? Nope. You can never tell. Agatha, we've been waiting for you. Where have you been? At the church getting ready for your celebration tomorrow. Ah, I see. And, um, how are things looking? All is in order. Liar. I was at the church. How long, child? How long have you been conspiring against me? I'm… Father, I don't know what you're talking about. Traitor. We have had eyes on you for weeks now, Agatha. Creeping around thinking you're oh so clever. We will save you a special seat at the emperor's celebration. Right beside the executioner and his gleaming, sharp ax. [Sabrina] What do you mean, they took her? Who took her? - That little monster Harvey Kinkle. - I'll kill him. - I swear to Hecate, I'll kill him. - Witches. For some time, we were as if asleep. Victims of Blackwood's perverted wiles. He made us forget. He wanted us confused and weak so that he could control us. And he did. But now we are awake, and we shall not suffer Blackwood to live. [all cheering] [Faustus] Chaos, murder, mayhem, disease. The world has come undone. Only Greendale survives, and barely. And we all know what's to blame. Witches. Filthy, scheming witches. Thirsty for the blood of our babies. [crowd] Yeah! Before I was appointed divine emperor, witchcraft was all around you, and you didn't even know it. Why, this very building used to house their hateful, unholy church, if you can stomach that. [crowd booing] And harsh though it may seem, today we will do what we must to protect ourselves. [crowd] Yeah! But first, before the executions... [growls] ...we will hear an actual witch's confession. Prudence, begin the stoning. We will do as our forefathers did. As Giles Corey suffered in Salem, so must the accused, Nicholas Scratch. Take the weight of these stones until the truth is pressed out of him. [Nick grunting and panting] What say you, Mr. Scratch, with your devil's name? Speak up. More weight. [crowd gasps] Pathetic! Very well, more weight. [grunting] I'm a witch! [crowd gasps] I, Sabrina Spellman, born of a mortal woman and the Dark Lord Satan himself, proudly proclaim myself a witch. At last! I knew, even in my perfect world, it would only be a matter of time before you revealed yourself, Ms. Spellman. All this cruelty and suffering just to get to me, Father Blackwood? Emperor Blackwood. [casts spell in Latin] - [Anubis growling] - [laughs] You hopeless, ponsing little prat. Did you really think me so basic? It's no use. He's still in control of reality. Reality. He's right, Ms. Spellman. Emperor Blackwood is a witch! You worm! You wretch! Witches, now! I should smite you where you stand. - [ligature stretching] - [Faustus grunts] Hold that bad thought, Father Blackwood. [barks] Aunt Hilda, the dog. [barks, whimpers] Judas, Judith. Melvin, Lilith. Mr. Kinkle, do your duty. Moment of truth, Harvey. Prudence! Prudence, listen to me. Father Blackwood's trapped us in a warped reality. Help us, Sister. Prudence, we all hate Blackwood, no one more than you. Prudence, I stopped you from killing Blackwood once, and for that I am sorry. Tell us, tell us, Weird Sister, how we can end his madness. - [buzzing] - [gasps] You... you have to wish on the Imp, not destroy it. Luckily, that was a decoy. He keeps the real one in his safe at Dorian's, behind his portrait. Robin, can you get to the Imp? On it. [Sabrina] Nick! Sorry that took a minute, Nick. - [chains jangle] - Who are you? Really? A friend. A hot friend. Just so you know, I could have taken a lot more weight. Well, I believe it. Are you really flirting with your ex-boyfriend now? He doesn't know me. It doesn't count. I got it! Oh, what took you so long? There were, like, eight million combinations to try. - Now can I go save my boyfriend? - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi... It's over, Father Blackwood. I wish the world back to the way it was. [chuckling] I don't understand. We do. We three see it. That Imp, too, is a false idol. Submit. Submit to my will! If the first two Imps were bogus, then where the heaven is the real one? He'd keep it near him at all times. Of course, in the form of something no one would ever touch. Anubis, kill her. Anubis, working dog in Blackwood's tracks, rest your paws and just relax. Good boy, Anubis. And now I wish it all back to how it was before the perversion. No! Wait! - [loud ringing] - [all gasping, screaming] [ringing fades] - Hear me, Imp, and pervert the... - [screams] [loud ringing, crunching] [ringing fades] [water running] We're at Baxter High. Does that mean... [sighs] Pray to Hecate. [students chattering] Everything's normal again. All in a day's work for two teenage witches. [both sigh] - Love you, Roz. - Love you too, Brina. [bell ringing] [Harvey] Hey. Can we talk for a sec? Uh, y... Sure. What's up? Um... Earlier, I was an ass. I freaked out, which is okay, but I should have said, "I love you, and I'm here for you, all of you, witch, Sentinel, co-president." [upbeat pop music playing] Why the change of heart? Let's say… I wanna be at your side, on the right side of history. Hey, boys. Want a flyer? "Witches United"? - The hell's that supposed to mean? - That Roz and I are running as witches. It means we are powerful, disruptive women, champions of the oppressed, supporters of the othered, unapologetic feminists, allies to all those who live in the shadow of the patriarchy... reminders that the shadow has its own power. We will speak the truth, and we will fight injustice. So in other words, Billy Marlin, we are Sabrina Spellman… And Rosalind Walker. We are teenage witches, and we will be your next… …student council co-presidents. [crowd cheering and applauding] I could not kill him, so this was the next best thing. [muttering] A fitting end for his kind. I brought the Imp back as well… and Agatha. [muttering] Sabrina, can I, uh, talk to you for a second? Sure. I, um... I have to get something off my chest. An impressive chest, if ever there was one. Joke-flirt all you want, Sabrina, but… we obviously still have feelings for each other. At least I still have feelings for you, and I won't deny that part of myself. But among other things, what about Prudence? We had fun, but it's… it's not what we had. It's not what I want us to have again. Nick, what are you saying? Sabrina Spellman... we're end-game. [eerie music playing]
