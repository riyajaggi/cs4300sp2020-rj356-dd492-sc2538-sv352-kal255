 - Hi. - Hey. - Can I have a word with you ? - Sure. Come on in. Watch your step. - Kuba, take it to the TV. - OK. - Hi. - Hey. - Do you want some coffee ? - I'm on my way back from Kwiatkowski. They're scared shitless, Marketa. - What do you mean, shitless ? - They're scared. They're worried it really was all to do with Hanka. That someone from the village wanted to get back at her. What exactly did he say ?

 Can you imagine if they start writing that it's all the company's fault ? That they set people against each other over coal, and now Misha's dead because of it ? And what would that mean ? That they'd like, back out now ? - I don't know. - Come on, that's bullshit ! You know how much money they've poured in to this already ? - They won't flinch now. - Maybe not, I don't know. But the whole thing will be put on hold. Buying the houses, all that work. They want to wait at least until things calm down a bit. And how long will that be ? - A month, two, a year ? - I don't know. Did Kwiatkowski himself say that ? It's Rajner. Masarova speaking.

 Of course. I'll be there right away. Give me five minutes. See you. They're in front of the civic center already. I have to open for them. WASTELAND Episode 8 Come in. Up the stairs. Here are the keys to the bathroom, if you need it. What if you don't find him even after all this ? What'll you do then ? We'll keep looking until we do find him. You know... Lots of people would have moved out of here ages ago if this hadn't happened. - I'm just asking for their sake. - I know. I understand. But there's nothing to be done. It's a complicated situation for everyone. Sure. Alright. I'll be next door. Just call if you need anything. Thanks. Come in. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm here for the sampling. - What's your name ? Tovarys, Josef. - Please, sit down. - Thanks. - Do you have your ID ? - I do. - Should I take my shirt off ? - No. Open your mouth. They won't catch anyone anyway, you'll see. How so ? If you were the murderer and knew they had your DNA. Would you go there ? - Well no, I'd run ! - Exactly, you'd run. And you'd run where, Franta ? Where would you go ? You don't show, and they know right away it was you. They'll have you by nightfall. What if it's like this from now on ? What ? What do you mean ? What if we won't ever trust anybody again ? No. No, don't worry. Alois Mikulik. 753 842 251. Everyone came. - Even Abrham ? - Among the first. - And did you speak with Rajner ? - Yeah. He'll have the results in few days. He promised to call you. Thank you for coming to court. They probably wouldn't have let me go otherwise. I didn't do it for you. I did it for your mom. She asked us to come. I didn't want to be seen in Pustina. My parents have enough to deal with. I'm moving to Liberec. I leave tomorrow. A friend of Martin Stransky's has a company there. He'll hire me. I really didn't want this, Klara. I thought... I'd do it once, to make some money. Gredy put me up to it, saying that if I brought him some pills from Poland he'd settle that debt on my car. Then it got really out of hand and... - I didn't know how to get out of it. - I heard it all in court already. It's true, Klara. I'd never lie to you. You'd keep doing it if it hadn't come out. You don't know what it's like when there's no money at home. Your dad might be a bit cracked, but your mom never had to support him financially. I just don't want to end up like that. People laughing behind my back. No one laughs at your dad. He's a nice guy, people like him. The only one embarrassed by him is you. I hope everything works out for you. Bye. Vojta Krusina ? He's lucky to be walking ! I saw it, he had handcuffs on, they put him in the police car. Why would they arrest him ? He wasn't even tested, was he ? - They only tested boys over 15. - Call Rajner. - I called, he didn't answer. - Then call him again. Vojta... I know it's been a long time. But can you remember what you were doing that day Misha Sikorova disappeared ? It was a Wednesday, a weekday, the 23rd of February. What do you usually do on Wednesdays ? What time do you get out of school, for instance ? - At a quarter to two. - And which bus do you ride ? Hang on. - You said 23rd of February ? - Yeah. Then Vojta wasn't even home when Misha went missing. You were in the mountains, remember ? That's right. Their class was on a skiing trip ! In Spindl ! They left the weekend before ! - A skiing trip ? - Yeah. I went to pick him up from the train station when he got back ! The police were still in Pustina, they were still looking for Misha. You were there the entire time ? You didn't leave to go anywhere ? No. We'll need the address of Vojta's school. We'll also need the names of teachers and classmates who were there with him, so we can confirm it. He's here in the high school. I can give you his homeroom teacher's number. Thanks. Wait here a moment. Why did you take him in, then ? We saw you taking him away ! Between the DNA sample his father gave and the sample found on Misha we found a partial match. What does that mean ? It means that Misha's murderer is Krusina's close relative. - His father, brother, or son. - What ? Mr. Krusina has no brother, and his father has passed, so we assumed it was his son. Vojta ? He wouldn't even be able to walk to that cottage ! They must have made a mistake in the lab. Because when Misha went missing, Vojta was 100 kilometers from here in the mountains. His teachers and classmates all confirmed it. So... What does that mean ? What are you going to do ? We're going to have to repeat the tests. We have proof that Pavel Abrham had that donkey from our daycare killed. A boy from juvie did it for him. His name is Tibor Balog. They might know something about Misha. What ? That boy took photos of it. This is his phone. Where did you get that phone ? We just got it, it doesn't matter. You have to question him and Abrham. Ms. Sikorova, we haven't found a single piece of evidence that would link Misha's murder to the killing of your donkey. Balog was tested, and ruled out as the perpetrator. We saw him meeting with Abrham. He has his number in his phone, they call each other. And what does that prove ? That he calls a taxi ? Ms. Sikorova... I asked you to keep out of this investigation. I'm not going to keep repeating it. Goodbye. What if we never find out ? Pustina will be bulldozed. Everyone will leave. Soon they won't remember a thing. We'll find him. If the police don't, we will. How will you find him ? You don't even know where they're all moving. They'll just leave, you think they even care ? Abrham and Masarova ? It wasn't their kid, so what ? Abrham will keep on driving his taxi, robbing customers. Masarova will go on cutting mold from salami. Nothing's going to change at all for them. Karel... I'm going home. - Bye. - Bye. Help ! - Leave me alone ! - Move your bum. Hey, let go of me ! Cut it out ! - Stick it in there ! - Don't touch me. Let go of me. Idiots. Petr ? Petr ! Is Krusina here ? - He's not working here anymore. - How's that ? You'll have to go to the mine. He works with the miners now. But maybe you'll catch him at home, if you hurry. - So you're moving. - Yep. Where did you take the boys ? Here and there. To juvies where there was room. Do you remember that case when some kid from Hradec killed an old lady in the projects ? Stabbed her to death with some scissors. He was here at this juvie. - I don't know if you worked here then. - Yeah. Do you know what happened to that boy ? - Why ? - What is he doing now ? I don't know, we don't get updates. They say he moved to Prague. - He's free ? - Yep. He was 14 when he did it. He wasn't criminally responsible. They had to let him go when he turned 18. And is somebody watching him now ? So he doesn't do it again ? No... I don't know, probably not. Is that why you came ? What about you ? What are you going to do ? - Work at another juvie somewhere ? - I don't know yet. That's... Vojta ! Petr... - You have a moment ? - What's up ? I looked for you at the juvie. I didn't know you weren't there anymore. The police told us about your Vojta. About the mistake in the tests. I hear they botched it at that lab of theirs. Vojta wasn't even home when Misha went missing. I wouldn't even suspect Vojta. Look, if you think I did it, I was at the town hall meeting all afternoon, everybody saw me. Did you know I always envied you ? - For what ? - All the girls were after you. I always thought: What the heck do they all see in him ? But yeah... - Even Hana liked you, seriously. - Oh, come on. How many did you have actually ? I know about Gabina, Radka Mikulikova, and Marketa. But there must have been more. Sometimes I wonder if you actually had something going on with Hanka. - Are you crazy ? - I know what it's like, Petr. You don't want to cheat on your wife. You don't want to hurt her but you can't help yourself. It's just who you are. It's how you were born, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's just in your genes. What's your point, Karel ? Isn't it funny ? The whole gene thing ? Such itty- bitty little guys, and in the end they make all the decisions. Who you are. What you do. What you did. I'm taking Vojta to school. He's had enough as it is. That's why the police took Vojta, right ? They tested all the men over 15. They found a match with your sample, so they took Vojta. Because they didn't realize there could be another little Krusina running around town. What the hell are you talking about ? Have you lost your mind ? Which one is it ? Little Mikulik ? Or Masar ? - Go away. - Which one is it ? Get out of here ! - Get in the car ! - Which one ? Go away, Karel, leave us alone. Which one ? What did he want ? Krusina speaking, hello. I need to speak to Captain Rajner. Take this for the little guy and say hello from me. - Sure, thanks. See you. - See you. How much is this can ? Marketa, wake up ! I'll take three. You can count it up. - Yes ? - Ms. Sikorova ? - Is your husband with you ? - No, he's off somewhere. What happened ? Well if he turns up, let me know. Thanks. Call Masarova, find out where her boy goes to school. I'll have the guys start a manhunt for Sikora. - I'll meet you by the car. - Right. Yes. Yes, of course. - Marketa ! Did they call you ? - Yeah. Karel went after him. Come with me. - Do you know him ? - Yeah, he's from class C. - Where's their classroom ? - Second floor, by the labs. Is this 8C ? Where is Kuba Masar ? - He's not in school today. - How come ? - I don't know. He didn't come. - Is he ill ? He was here yesterday. Professor ! We partied together in the K-Bar. Last week. Right... Do you know Kuba Masar ? - He's from class C, right ? - Do you know where he is ? Probably at the Vondraceks' house, that's where they always hang out. - And where is that ? - Fialka housing complex. - He lives next door to me. - Where exactly ? - 12 Havlickova St. - 12 Havlickova St. Are you looking for someone ? What are you doing here ? - Who was that ? - I don't know. - What did he want from you ? - Nothing. And you go to the other side, the back entrance. Wait there. Thank you very much, if anything comes up, then my colleagues... Excuse me. - Where's Kuba ? - He didn't come to school today. - Do you know where he could be ? - No. Mr. Sikora was just here looking for him. Have you tried calling your son ? - He's not picking up. - Then try it again. Have the guys try locating his phone. They should find it if it's not turned off. Right, okay. - Could you come with us ? - Yeah. She's gone ape-shit again, huh ? Pick it up or she'll keep nagging. She's out of luck. I'm at an exam. - Yes ? - I have some flyers. Could you let me in ? Are you looking for someone ? Lock your door. Damn that's the door... Turn the ringer off. Man that's Misha Sikorova's dad out there ! What's he doing here ? Your fucking ringer man ! - Did you tell anyone we're here ? - Do you think I'm stupid ? Look, he stopped. - Move it, you got to get out of here. - What if that freak's still out there ? It's okay, he's gone. It's good. Just go through the back door in case he's waiting outside. Go on. Mr. Sikora... Please ! Rajner. Where ? - We're on our way. - What happened ? Turn around for Fialka when you can. A lady from the apartment block called in saying she saw your husband with your son. - You got the address ? - 12 Havlickova St. Shut up I'm telling you. Mr. Sikora ! I didn't do anything. Please ! Help ! - Please ! - Kuba ! Are you going to confess ? Talk ! Karel ! Let him go, Karel ! Kuba ! Karel, leave him alone ! - Speak ! - Please ! Karel he hasn't done anything ! Leave him alone ! - Please ! - Why did you do it ? - Mr. Sikora ! - Stay back and don't move ! - I can't hold on ! - Either he confesses or I drop him. Put him down. He's not worth it to you. - You stay out of this ! - I can't hold on ! Please ! Help ! - Don't hurt him... Please. - He killed my little girl. - This is not going to help anything. - My little girl ! Why did you do it ? You piece of shit ! Talk to him. Karel... Please, don't make it easier on him. Easier ? What is going to happen to him ? Nothing ! - Please, help ! - Karel ! I'm coming over to you now... - They'll let him go. - Help. - He killed my little girl. - Please ! Call someone from the juvenile section so we can interrogate him straight away. What are you gonna do to me ? I haven't turned 15 yet. I can't go to jail. Vasek, take it easy ! - Hello. - Hello. This is Ms. Vitaskova from the child protection department. I want to talk to my mom. It's too late to play the little boy now. You should have thought of your mom before this. You are under arrest on suspicion of having murdered Misha Sikorova. - But I want to talk to her. - That's not possible now. I want to tell her it's all that bitch's fault ! What 'bitch' ? Sikorova ! Everyone in Pustina hates her, ask anyone you want ! That's why you killed her daughter ? Because everyone hates her ? Her little trashy laughed at me in school ! In front of everyone, she laughed at me, saying dad had to run off on us. That no one could put up with my mom. No one could put up with her mom ! So you killed and raped Misha because she laughed at your mom ? - Mr. Rajner ! - Take him away. Kuba didn't do it, Hana. He's a good boy. I know him. - He would never do anything like that. - My colleague will take you downstairs. - Please, come with me. - He's such a good boy. - Hanka, you know him too. - Please, come with me. Kuba would never do anything like that. I would know. Jakub Masar met Misha in the woods in front of your cottage. He saw there was no one there. And that's where it happened. - Did he rape her ? - No. Misha was a virgin, Ms. Sikorova. He tried to rape her, but... He couldn't penetrate her. So he tried with his fingers... He had some abrasions on his fingers apparently. So that's how his DNA got inside her. Then he dragged Misha to the well, and threw her in. He was even present-minded enough to take her keys and throw them in the mine to throw us off. But why ? - Why did he do it ? - We don't know yet. We found photos in his phone similar to those in Tibor Balog's. Balog denies it, but... Jakub confessed that they killed the donkey together. It may have something to do with the disputes between his mom and yourself. He is quite fixated on her. And what's more... He and Misha apparently had a row in school that day. We may never find out exactly why it happened. There may not have been any specific reason at all. Lift it, lift... Wait, let me help you. - It's fine, this one is light. - I go first. All done, ma'am, can we go ? - You have the address ? - Yeah, 375 Jiraskova, 4th floor. So see you there. We're off. I might come back for the boxes but, you won't be here by then, I guess. If you need any help, I'll be at the cottage. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Klara. Buckle up. Hang on, I forgot my phone. I'll be right back. Dad ? The End
