 Karel ! Karel ! Wait up ! You forgot your jacket. What's with you, man ? Here. For the road. Come on, I'll help you. They have to search the mine again. Thoroughly, you know ? Goddamn Polish. Acting like they're all so helpful and try so hard... Bullshit. They rub their hands with pleasure at Hanka having other worries than the referendum.

 - She only said it when she was angry. - She was right. I fucked it all up, it's my fault. If I hadn't left you, Misha might be here now. I just didn't want you all to have to see me all the time for the girls to have to see me when I'm out of it. I know they're ashamed of me. - It's not your fault that you're ill. - Please forgive me. Forgive me... That hurts ! - Go away. - I didn't mean to. Go away ! - Mom ? - Nothing happened. What is he doing here again ? Don't make a scene. Everything's fine. You just had a little romp, did you ? - Klara, please. - What ? We don't know what's up with Misha and this is what you're thinking about ? I'm not thinking about anything, stop it ! Then why did you drag him back here ? I don't want him here ! He's your father, and I can't tell him not to come here. He did something to you ? He didn't do anything, it's his, he cut himself. Jesus, Klara, you know he's ill ! Then let him get treatment and take his damn pills. - No one's going to help him here. - Klara... Klara. - You got it ? - I got it. It's fine. - Fuck, it's the cops ! - What the fuck is this ? We can go. It's done. If I ever find out you're still at it, I'm going straight to the cops. Buckle up. - He let you pick it out ? - I found it on the website. Let me see. Man, that's gross. You must have been high as a kite, huh ? You shut the fuck up. And you've got what ? - How much did it cost ? - Nothing, a grand. No way. Man, he wanted three from me. - Well you didn't give him head. - You shut the fuck up ! Next, come on. Would you be so kind, ma'am ? Are you 100% positive ? I'm telling you I don't know him. I remember faces. You haven't even taken a proper look. - When was this supposed to be ? - Last Wednesday. I was off. I was at my parents. You've never seen this girl either ? How about your curb crawlers ? Drivers, truckers... - No one mentioned anything ? - Mentioned anything to me, you mean ? Why do you think I called you girls in ? Just for the joy of it ? One of you saw that girl near the border. Then ask that one, I don't know ! - What about that Rudi of yours ? - What about him ? He's got girls milling around him who haven't even turned 18 yet, right ? I don't know who he's banging, ask him, I don't know. I get feeling you're acting like you owe me nothing at all. Look, if I knew the girl, would I not tell you ? Are they fucking kidding me ? - Let go of it. - You whore ! Stop pissing me off you bitch ! Well ? What's it going to be ? Somebody actually hung a horse from a barbed wire ? I wasn't asking about that. Are you trying to find out who did it ? Look, I'm not in the mood for your fooling around today. - Maybe I know something about that. - Really ? I know a guy who has wire like that at home. And what's that supposed to be ? - A clue ? - He's seriously nuts. I think he gets off on things like that. He was at the gas station a few days ago. He didn't want to do it in the car, he talked me into going to his place. He was weird from the start, but then he went psycho, talking complete nonsense, And he wanted to fuck constantly ! He couldn't get enough. And he had figures made from that kind of wire. And freaky junkyard statues all around the cottage. - Around a cottage ? - Yeah. Where exactly was this ? - Marlboro light. - Sure. - Hi, Karel. - Hi. - That's alright. - Thanks. 220. Wait for your change ! Shari. You ran ? Everybody's still asleep. It's Saturday. Don't be crazy, we can't be seen together. Who did you text me from ? - You know anything about Misha ? - No. - Balog knows something. - What ? He saw Misha's mom at the juvie and he got totally freaked out. He asked where she was. He was out when Misha got lost, you get it ? Wait, Hana was at the juvie ? - Yeah. - Like, to see you ? - What did you tell her ? - Nothing. Forget about Balog. He doesn't know shit. Just don't tell anyone about him ! If the cops start asking him questions, first thing he'll do is rat us out. Here. For the last batch. Go on. Before you get in trouble. And don't text or call me, alright ? They might be watching me. Hi ! Good morning. I got you some nougat doughnuts, Klara. - I've eaten already. - I got jam ones for you. I have to get changed. - Do you want coffee or tea ? - Doesn't matter. - Good God, now I've done it... - Franti, come eat, it's getting cold. Hang on, eight more times. - I'm not going to keep heating it up. - Cut it out. I have to learn it. It's new, I have to try it out. - Hello. - Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I saw the car here... Yeah, the old Maluch. I see you're practicing. - That's new, huh ? - Yeah, my wife. I've been considering getting a cottage here for some time. I thought I'd ask the natives if they know of anything. Okay, the Hubaceks wanted to sell, that's the one by the woods. Right, Franti ? Don't ask me, you're the one who knows. Well I wouldn't mind something in the forest. Like your place. Or your neighbors' over there. Do they come here ? Lately it's been just him, Sikora. He actually lives there. And what kind of folks are they ? Is there any talking to them ? They're the ones with the daughter everybody's looking for. The police were even here asking questions. - But Sikora won't want to sell it. - Do you know him well ? No, but he won't sell. But the Hubaceks, maybe. - You want their number ? - Well if you insist... - And what is your name anyway ? - Ruzicka. Come in, come in. Sit down, have something to eat. - I'll call her. - Thanks. Klara ? Lukas is here. Hi. Are you sure we shouldn't cancel ? We could stay here with you. - Nah, you go on. - But if you need anything... I'm going. I have something for you. I found it at night among some old photographs. Get a load of this. Isn't it incredible ? Look, how old are you here ? Five ? Six ? And Klara three ? Four ? And you're already together. Already holding hands. And Klara is laughing. Isn't it amazing ? - Hang on, that's not me though. - You're crazy. That's you. With Klara ! - I remember taking the picture. - Are we going ? - Well... See you. - See you. Are you dressed enough, Klara ? It's cold outside. Not to be rude, but it pisses me off how they can't understand. They just think whoever ends up in juvie is like, the worst scum. And I think that to get here you don't have to be scum. In some cases it's the parents' fault. And what about your case ? - Like, why am I here ? - Yep. As punishment. For the 5,000 I stole off my dad. - Where would your old man get 5K ? - Shut up, moron ! Hey take it easy, okay ? So you still see it as punishment that you're in here ? I see it as a 3-month stay. To do some thinking about myself. Sort things out in my head. Talk to my parents, smooth things out between us. And there are folks here to help. Not like outside. If you try hard enough. You didn't try much this week. You got five black marks. So next week, fifth level. No leave. Agreed ? - I can't hear you. - Yeah. So go for snacks and pack your stuff. We go swimming this afternoon. What the fuck ? I got a call, Pasek. From grandpa. Said you fucked my grandma. Go fuck yourself. You think it's OK to fuck my grandma, or what ? If she's as ugly as you, I wouldn't touch her. - Come here. Dave, come here ! - What ? What are you doing ? Bash him one. What are you looking at ? You want to be down there instead of him ? Do it. What is it ? You worried he won't suck your dick anymore ? Hey ! I haven't dismissed you. Do it. What was that shit ? Kick the fuck out of him. More. More ! You could kick for the national team. We'll take him, won't we ? - He's a regular Messi, man. - Hi, is my dad around ? Do you see him here ? - Throw him the fuck out. - Get out. The little cripple needs his diapers changed. Let's go. Let the shitbag air out in here. - We wanted to call you... - What's this, you're leaving ? We've searched the edge of the mine and there are cameras in the mining area. We've checked the footage, haven't found anything. Are you kidding me ? That mine is huge ! Don't tell me you had time to search it all ! - Look, Ms. Sikorova... - Don't give me that ! Captain Rajner is in charge of the search for my daughter. Where is he ? He is probably searching for your daughter. - I want to see the camera logs. - That's impossible. - There's hours and hours of it. - How come you're all done, then ? We can't stop the mining operations for so long, Ms. Sikorova. Where are you ? Did you know the police are pulling out of the mines ? Please calm down and don't shout at me. I'll explain everything. I need to talk to you and your husband anyway. I'm on my way to your place right now. That's alright, I can wait. But please hurry, it's important. Don't think for one second that the press won't find out about this. - OK, thanks. - Bye. I'll be back. Standa sends this for you. You hate it here, don't you ? - We can go home. - It's fine. - Come on, we'll go. - You don't like it here ? - I thought you like coming here. - What ? - Just to sit and chat... don't you ? - Why are you saying that ? You think I come here to hit on girls ? Klara, don't be silly. - Klara, what happened ? - Did you come here with my sister ? - What ? - Yes or no ? - We ran into each other a few times. - Why didn't you tell me ? Why would I tell you ? There's nothing wrong with that, is there ? I just find it kind of strange that my boyfriend sits around in pubs with my 14-year-old sister, and doesn't tell me about it. We weren't sitting around anywhere. I don't know who's been telling you this bullshit. I just met her here few times. What were you doing the night before last ? I told you, didn't I ? I was at my parents. Then how come they saw you here ? What, you think I'm lying ? Or that I know something about Misha ? That I did something to her ? Maybe you should ask your dad first. Misha was supposed to visit him. Yeah, and ? Klara, he's completely nuts, you know that full well. You think I didn't notice your mother's neck ? Who's she get the bruises from ? Fuck you. Klara. Klara, wait ! - Want a hit ? - No. They can't be serious. - Where's your boss ? - Over there by the balloons. Look at that house. - I think it belongs to them. - The whole thing ? Mom, where do I put the bread rolls ? The ones from yesterday ? Put them in the back. Look. What's her problem this time ? Can we not even have a fair ? Not if it's organized by Turkowo, I guess. Can you imagine that your kid gets lost and you bother about this ? Majka, come on. She's a nervous wreck. Maybe if she didn't stick her nose into everything and was taking care of her kids instead, she wouldn't be a nervous wreck now. You gave them a permit ? Yeah, why wouldn't I ? All their papers were in order. Without the miners money, there wouldn't be anything going on around here. Yeah, right. I didn't think of that. Hello. Hello. - Karel didn't let you in ? - I don't think he's home. Karel ! Karel ! Karel ! He's probably out in the woods. Why do you want to talk to him anyway ? We just need to verify a couple things. It doesn't matter, we'll find him. - If he shows up, let me know. - Wait... Is Karel a suspect ? No, I just need to ask him a few things. He would never hurt Misha. He wouldn't lay a hand on her ! Can't you go make a proper search of that mine, instead of blaming us ? At least that would be worthwhile, don't you think ? I think you should take a rest Ms. Sikorova. And please, do let me know when your husband is back. Thank you. Goodbye. Bark ! And stay. - Hi. - Hi. - Here, I'll take your place ! - Thanks. Let go. Let go of it. Sit. I know I fucked up, bro. I'm an idiot. I needed money, and I got dragged in. Don't tell me this. I don't want to hear it. Klara accused me out of nowhere today of fooling around with Misha. - And did you ? - Bro, seriously ? It's Pasek spreading the rumor. He wanted to get extra cash for the pills he smuggled. I told him to fuck off, and now he's trying to screw me over. But if the police hear about it, and they start poking around, then it's all going to come out. The crystal, too. I know I'm no angel... But why the fuck should I go to prison just for a few hits of crystal ? Every other guy around here is baked on it. Will you please talk to him, bro ? Dear fellow citizens. In cooperation with the Turkowo mining company, we cordially invite you to a fun afternoon starting today at 5 p.m. on the town square. We've prepared plenty of refreshments, live music and competitions for both young and old. We look forward to seeing you there. - May I ? - Yeah. I've got good news for you. You can go to the swimming pool with the others. I don't need to. I heard you had a spat with Balog in the kitchen yesterday. I don't give a fuck about him. - But you don't like each other much. - Does anyone like Balog ? Just forget about him. Don't get into trouble because of him. He'll be out in a while and you'll never see him again. Why do you two hate each other so much anyway ? - Did he do something to you ? - No. You wouldn't tell me anyway, would you ? You're no 'konfident'. Do you know what that word actually means, 'konfident' ? - A rat. - Exactly. But do you know what it meant originally ? In Latin ? A confidant. Someone you trust. And you see how it got twisted around since then. Today, if word gets out you're a 'konfident', no one believes anything you say anymore. Everybody knows it about you. Everyone watches out for you. No one likes a 'konfident'. Everyone's afraid of them. The worst things people do, they don't do out of hatred, Filip. They do them out of fear. Balog will be out of here shortly, but you have three more months. At least. How do you think you'd do around the boys if you were labeled a 'konfident' ? And let some fresh air in, it's stuffy in here. There's a jumping castle for the kids, cotton candy, carousel, so please come closer. Turkovo mining company has prepared everything for you. Spiderwoman ! So what's your plan ? What happens to the boys, you'll put them up somewhere ? Yeah, other institutions will take them, it's already arranged. - What, are you gonna miss them ? - They never did anything wrong to me. Have some, it's not too strong. Good ? I hear the miners offered you a new position over there. We don't have a deal yet. They promised they would pay for Vojta's treatment. Nobody else would help us around here. Of course. Anybody would do that for his kid, right ? Nobody can blame you. Family always comes first, doesn't it ? Anyway, I've got to go take the boys to the pool. - Bye - See you. - Bye. - Bye. Hey and did you try the Spider ? It's a great feeling... Now it's your turn, Vera. Is he crazy ? He's going to set the place on fire. Hanka, come on, let's go. Franti ! Franti, there's some cops here. It's that guy who was looking around the cottages. Here you go. Come along Hani, come on. - Has something happened ? - Make us some grog. Hani, what happened ? Is it Misha ? - What time is it ? - 7:30, why ? I've got to go home, Klara will be looking for me. No, just sit. She'll call if she needs you. Don't you have your phone ? Hani ! ...he's here in our studio in person to ask for the help of our viewers. Good evening. I... Four days ago, our daughter, Misha, went missing. She's fourteen years old. We don't know what could have happened to her or where she could have gone. She had no reason to run away. I want to ask, if you have any information, or if you saw her somewhere, to let us know. - Nikolka ? - Pavel ! Come, quickly, come ! What ? I can't hear you. Misha, if you're watching, your mom and I love you and we miss you terribly. - Daddy, it broke. - Hang on a sec. We're very worried about you. If something has happened, please, if you can, come home. If something has happened, we can work it out. - Thank you. - You have nothing to be afraid of. We have faith that Misha will be found alive and well. Any information you have can be sent to the phone number 800 23 52 73. Sikorova. Where are you ? Alright. Alright I'm on my way. - Do you want us to call a taxi ? - I'll take the bus. I'll walk you downstairs. I have to use my card to let you out. - That would be kind of you, thanks. - That's him. Karel Sikora ? - What's going on ? - Drop your things, put your hands up. - What happened ? - Against the wall. Spread your legs. The jacket. Didn't you hear me ? No diving. - You haven't changed yet ? - I don't feel well. In what way ? Sounds like tuberculosis, at best. Get outta here, come on ! What ? You got a problem ? Get in the pool. Move it. Punks. They're gonna drive me crazy one day. You're spitting in there ? Stop that right now ! You can't swim in the water but you can spit in it, huh ? I wasn't spitting. - You think I'm hallucinating ? - I think you are. Good evening. Rajner, CID. We've already met, right ? We are going to search Sikora's cottage. Could one of you come with us as a witness, please ? - What ? - As a witness. I'll go. Cigarettes. - You can't go in here. - They called me here, let me in. - It's alright. - Where is Captain Rajner ? Good evening, hold on, he's coming. - What's going on ? Hi. - Hi. Good evening. I'm glad you came. Here is the search warrant. We went looking for Misha here the very first night. I know. - Open the door for us, please ? - Okay. Boys, move it, come on. We won't be here forever. So what's up, Pasek... What are you doing ? Give me your hand. What the hell happened ? Did you throw him in ? - He slipped. - The hell he did ! He pulled him under, I saw it. He wanted to drown him, the fool. You mean this trash ? What would I get out of that ? We'll deal with that when we get back. Go ! - Are you alright ? - Don't slip, moron. Well he's had it. Let me see. Look at me. - Well ? - Nothing. Just shit. Go search the stream, the entire basin all the way to the pond. You know the girl's blood type ? I don't know, it's in the papers. Or ask her mother. - Where does the plumbing lead ? - There's a tank behind the cottage. Give me that flashlight. Hold the ladder for me. - It's empty. We already checked it. - Now you tell me. - Clean that off. - Sure. Give me a hand. What's in there ? End of episode 4
