 She was drawing in the garden. Then she was just gone. She's not in the playground and she's not at Venca's. I've been there. - What happened ? - Nikola's lost. She wasn't at the pool either, the boys didn't see her there. - Calm down, Alca. - Pavel... How did she get lost ? She was playing in the garden. Then she was just gone. - Did you call the police ? - Yeah, they're on the way. Oh my God. Kuba, would you take Bara to our house, please ? You go with Kuba, ok ? Mom is at home. Let's go, then ! Come on ! Come say something on the radio. Maybe she heard the announcement and she's scared to come back. Should I go with them ? - Go on, I'll catch up with you. - Alright. Nikola ? Nikola... Daddy and I are very worried about you. If you're okay, and you can hear us, don't be afraid to come home. I'll wait for you here, alright ? At the civic center. Or go to the pub to your aunt Jitka. Okay Nikola ? I hope you can hear me. Okay Nikola ? Hanka, I was out walking Blackie. We went around the stream and Karel was there. By Abrham's garden. - What ? - I saw him there last week too. He didn't see me, he went straight back into the woods. Hang on... Don't tell them anything. I'll call you soon. Karel ! Karel ? Hanka. - Where were you ? - Taking a swim in the quarry. - When did you get back ? - Just now. - And you weren't in Pustina ? - Why ? You don't know what happened ? They saw you by Abrham's house. I took the shortcut, through the woods. I didn't go into town. They saw you there last week, too. - Who ? - It doesn't matter. What were you doing there, Karel ? What's that ? - What is this ? - 67 days, Hanka. Every day I wait to hear from Rajner or someone else from the squad to tell us they've got him. I wait for it every day. You're watching them ? What do you think a guy who does something like that looks like ? You must think about that, too. You have to think about it. Maybe he seems laid-back ? Like Abrham ? - Or Krusina. - Were you following Abrham ? - Is that why you were there today ? - Hanka, I want to find out who did it. Their little girl got lost. This afternoon. She was playing in the garden and then she was gone. Everybody's looking for her. Tonda saw you around Abrham's house. You don't say. It can't be. Karel. Have you not found her yet ? - Where's Nikola ? Where's Nikola ?! - Pavel ! - I don't know anything. - Bullshit ! They saw you by our house ! What were you doing there, you freak ? He was at our house. He took the back way to the cottage, that's not illegal is it ? Karel didn't do anything to your Nikola. What time did you walk through there ? At 2 p.m. I guess. Around 2. - You didn't notice anything ? - Nikola ? - Nikola ! - Niki ! Nikola, are you okay ? - Nikola. - Where were you ? Are you okay ? What happened ? - Where were you ? - She's fine. She was down by the playground. She was playing with this kitten. Number 213 come in. Search terminated. The missing person has been found unharmed here in the town of Pustina. You should keep an eye on her. So she doesn't get hurt next time. Take her home. - What ? - Take her home ! Mr. Abrham, I need you and your wife to drop by at the station. - So we could write it all down. - Sure. And you, do you have a moment ? We need your contact information. - Yeah, sure. - Follow my colleague. Thank you all then, everything turned out OK. Sure, everything's taken care of and now you're just leaving ? They found the little girl, what else should we do ? She was found so you're just leaving and that's that ? None of us knows what's going on, no one's talking to us ! - Marketa, don't be foolish. - What do you mean foolish ? The investigation in Pustina is being led by the CID. You'll have to talk to them about that. You think they listen to us ? We can't even let our kids out of the house ! Why haven't you even set up patrols ? Are you waiting for something else to happen ? I'm sorry, but... we really can't help you, now. Sure. Let us rot here, for all you care ! So see you later. Hi... - Hi. - Hi. - Is dad here ? - Do you see him anywhere ? They have the bastard's fucking DNA. Why don't they test all of us ? Then we'll know for sure if it's a local. Exactly, they could have been done with this ten times over. I guess it's not that easy. You're not pissed that the miners put off the buy-out over this ? You won't lose any money, that's for sure. - Yeah, but... - Calm down, man. But when are we going to get it ? In half a year ? They said they wouldn't start buying until the bastard is found. So why don't they just test all of us, like they did it in the juvie ? Right ? Absolutely. Hi. May I ? What are you having ? - Water. - What kind ? Tap. I understand you're nervous. That you're afraid for your children. But I want to assure you we are doing everything we can to find the murderer. Do you think it's someone from the village ? We're looking into several possibilities. One of them is that the murderer is from Pustina. - And you just let him run around ? - What if he does it again ? Like the captain said already, we can't say with 100% certainty that the murderer is from Pustina. Does it matter ? If it's possible, then you have to do everything to protect us ! - We have children here ! - Look, I understand you're worried. But we feel certain that no harm will come to you or your children. - And how can you be sure ? - They're fucking joking, right ? Please... calm down, hang on... - Let the captain finish. - Silence ! Thank you. We've decided that from today until the perpetrator is apprehended, there will be a 24-hour police patrol. We are doing everything we can for your safety. Why don't you test all of us ? You have his DNA. If it's someone from here, we'll find him. Large-scale DNA tests of the entire town are not being considered at the moment. An investigation has certain rules. - Isn't there something else behind it ? - I don't know what you mean. That the tests for the entire town would be too expensive for you. You can't believe everything they write in the newspaper. - So it's not true ? - No, it isn't. You didn't notice the look on his face ? Didn't you look at him ? He's afraid of something, Hana, he's scared ! His daughter was missing a few hours before then, he was probably tense. And who found her ? Isn't it a little odd she suddenly pops up with some brat they just let out of juvie ? What was he doing there ? He's just happened to show up just then ? He was visiting his friends at the juvie. What's so strange about that ? No, no... He and Abrham know each other. Didn't you notice ? Notice what ? Didn't you see them look at each other when he brought the girl back ? - It was obvious they knew each other. - Karel... Isn't it odd that of all the people searching it was that boy who found her ? My God, what's odd about it ? What's odd about a boy visiting the juvie he was locked up, and where he's sure to have a lot of buddies ? What's strange about Abrham being stressed out ? Rajner said it had to be someone from the town. So what ? You think you're going to find him ? Figure out which one of them did it ? What are you playing at ? Look at yourself, for God's sake. Everyone thought I did it. - The whole town. - Right. And meanwhile, you'd done nothing at all, had you ? Here you go. No one wants it for that kind of money. Dude, they won't get any better for 800. - It's top quality ! - This shit ? You think you can just set up a lab in a shed, knock off a recipe, and make money ? Fine. I'll sell it myself. You fuck off. 500 for a gram. I won't give you more. - 500 ? For this "shit" ? - Give it here and get out. Or what ? You gonna beat me up, bitch ? You gonna beat me up, fucker ? Gonna beat me up, bitch ? I'll kill you, you hear me ? Fuck you ! You can go. Let me see your shoes. Are you fucking kidding me ? What ? Someone must have put that there, so what ? That's the last time you go out. That clear ? Oh really ? So he's a tough guy, huh ? You think you have it all figured out around here, don't you ? And what are you going to do ? Not let me go out ? Maybe you should take that straight to the cops. I got a lot of things that might interest them. I bet your brother will be happy too, huh ? What are you trying to pull on me, you piece of shit ? You know what I really don't understand ? You cover for your brother the whole time, and now you make a fuss over a few doses. Weird, huh ? It was you who called the cops on him, wasn't it ? Adam, do you have a moment ? You have a visitor downstairs. Yeah. Right away. Will you give me my shoe back ? Hi. We have a session starting in five minutes. What do you need ? Did you hear what happened at the Abrham's on Monday ? With their little girl ? - Yeah. - You know who found her ? One of your boys. You let him out, but he was still here last winter. I saw him with you a few times when you took them to town. What did he look like ? Thin, tell, buzz cut, black hair, and tattoos here. - Tibor ? - Who is he ? Why ? What was he here for ? Look, Karel... if you think... The police did tests on him. He wasn't here when the others got tested, but they got his contact and went for him. - Where can I find him ? - Why do you want to talk to him ? I just want to ask him something. I can't give out anyone's personal information. I'd get in a lot of trouble. I'm sorry, don't take it the wrong way. Gentlemen ! Wrap it up. - Bon appetit. - What do you want ? You had a boy here, maybe three months ago. His name is Tibor. Do you think you could find his address somewhere ? Come in. Hi. - Sit down. - Thanks. - You want something to drink ? - No, I'm fine, thanks. I'm here because of Lukas. He has his hearing next week. On the 9th. Wednesday. We saw a lawyer today. He said there's a good chance they'd let him go. The investigation continues of course, but he would be out. That prison is terrible. They're five to a cell, the worst scum. Lukas is the youngest one there, he said they already tried it on him. We can't even imagine that. What do you want from us ? The attorney said that if you came to court, you and Klara, that it would help Lukas a lot. If you testified about what he's really like... How he behaved... Hana, you've known him since he was little. I know he did a stupid thing. He'll carry it with him for the rest of his life. But he didn't do anything to Misha. He'd never hurt her. He wouldn't hurt anyone. You know him ! - He wouldn't hurt anyone ? - No. And what do you think he did with that shit he was cooking ? They're junkies. If Lukas hadn't given it to them, they'd get it elsewhere. You know what I'll do for Lukas ? Neither I nor Klara will go to that court. And we won't tell them that, for all those months, Lukas lied to our faces without batting an eye. I won't even tell them that I think the meth they found on Misha may have been from him. That's the only thing I'll do for him, Jitka. Hani... I've always tried to help you. - Jitka ? What time is the hearing ? - 1:30 p.m. I'll be there. Don't tell mom. Move it, get inside. Jirin, what did I tell you ? Watch him. What do you want ? Hello, Ms. Balogova, I'm from the Juvenile Detention Centre. - I'm here because of your son. - He's not home. Do you know where I can find him ? I need to speak to him. Get back in bed, you're sick. If we don't find him, we'll have to call the police. Call them, I don't give a shit. I don't give a fuck what you want, but my boyfriend's here in 10 minutes, and if you don't get the hell out... We found out your son stole some phones from his friends before leaving the juvie. Worth more than 15 thousand. It happened before his birthday, so we'll seek the damages from you. We'll hand it over to the police. Wait. I honestly don't know where he is. He owes some money to Honza, my boyfriend, so he avoids us. Get under that blanket and drink. See, and now I've split it. - When did you see him last ? - Two weeks ago ? What the hell did I tell you ? Get the dog out of here ! God dammit... Watch out, he bites. I won't do anything to him. What's that on his neck ? Brother said some bad people hurt him. Some losers put barbed wire around his neck and let it grow into the skin. - Barbed wire ? - What do I know ? Where might Tibor be hanging out right now ? Check it out, it's looking at me. Sunny, look. The fish is watching me. - She probably likes the looks of you. - But really, she's looking at me. Professor ! Professor, hi. - Hi there ! - What brings you here ? What about you ? We're having a party. Come, sit with us ! - Where ? - Here ! - Guys, look ! - Professor ! What brings you here ? - Look, look ! - What ? - It's Sikora. - You're really in our thoughts. They still haven't found anyone ? Come here, sit down with us. - What is it ? - Herbal tea. Remember graduation ? Have some ! Balog ! Bali, come here. Hi. Sorry, I couldn't make it earlier. Bitch wouldn't let me go. ...formed it, melted it, and only then did the glass come into being. But it's still our Mother Earth, and the Indian knows this ! But all we see is a glass. - You see the difference ? - Not at all ! At least you understand ? - Come on. - Like where ? - You're scared of me ? - Why not ? Come on, then. Come to the professor. - You okay ? Get up. - Fine ! I'm fine ! Tibor, you know who I am ? I need to talk to you. - About what ? - About Filip Paskowski. - What ? - You're the only one who can help me. You know him well, don't you ? You were in juvie together. - So what ? - The police fucked up. They shouldn't have let him go ! I know he knows something about Misha's murder ! The cops don't care. The cunts blew it off. They just want done with it. But I can't just leave it at that. She was my baby girl. Look... I'll pay you. But you have to help me. He's over there laughing at us, thinking he'll get away with it. You have to tell me everything you know about him ! What's he in juvie for ? Professor ! We're going out. You want to come with us ? Here you are ! You know each other ? Tibor, Honza ! My former student, a victim of mine ! Want some ? - What is it ? - An excellent tea. It's fine. They'll be here soon, come on. - Man, he got pretty wild, huh ? - He's completely pissed. Look, they're coming ! - That's good ! - That's shit. What are you staring at, professor ? You want to go for a ride too ? You're not up for it, huh ? Check this out. - He won't do it. - Hang on now... Watch these for me. - Out of the way. - No way... And off we go, man ! Go, let's go. Go ! Faster ! Go ! Go ! Good, go, go ! Go ! Now the home stretch ! Let's go ! - You're the bomb ! - Bomb my ass ! Watch. Get out of the way, bitch. Step on it this time, that sucked. - You've got some confidence ! - Here, you film it. Press here. Yeah, like I've never done it before. We're off. - Now look, man. Let's go. - He's nuts. What a character. Where'd you find him ? Hand me that... What you looking for ? What the fuck is that ? Now listen... You dial this number for me. - What ? - This number here. This one. Dial it for me from your phone. This taxi here. Taxi Abrham, hello ? - He's on his way, shoot it ! - Hello ? - Hey you, asshole, shoot it. - Where are you going ? Turn around, shoot it, come on ! He's the man. Respect, bro. He has Abrham's number in his phone. They called each other the day his girl got lost. That can't be coincidence, Hanka. It's all coming together ! I was at his parents' place. They have a dog with a barbed wire scar around its neck. He's probably nuts, he gets off on that stuff. - We have to tell the police. - But wait. The kid didn't come up with this by himself. Abrham is telling him what to do. But why is he doing it ? Somebody is paying him. How long do you have to shut it down for ? A day, maybe two. I would really like to help you, but this is up to the police. I think it's in your power to get the police to test the whole town. Are you crazy, Ms. Sikorova ? You think the police would allow a private company to meddle in a murder investigation ? I think they would. I have many more pictures like that. I also have proof this juvie kid, Tibor Balog, was in contact with Pavel Abrham. I'm certain he killed the donkey for him. It was supposed to scare me, so I would get out of your way. Excuse me ? You can't be serious. I don't know if you knew about it. I don't even care. But I am most certainly prepared to give the photos and other information to the media and the police. I wonder how long it will take them to get the real story out of Balog. And how long it will take for Abrham to talk. Do you think your PR division will manage ? Would you kindly tell me what this is ? Are you incapable of remembering how to put a burger together ? - What's wrong with it ? - Go on, show me how you fill them. Oh you think the pickle goes before the onion, do you ? - Does that matter at all ? - It certainly does. Re-do it. Take a new bun, for Christ's sake ! And that's the way you're going to do it. And if I find out one more time you messed up, then you're fired. We're not a charity here. You gave Sikora photos of that donkey ? He took my phone. Why'd you even take photos, you idiot ! - Hey, you got that money for me ? - You already got your money. - You get fuck all now. - Oh yeah ? Because I'll gladly tell the cops everything, I don't give a shit. What the fuck do you want to tell them ? You get a few blowjobs in juvie and think you're king of the world ? How about I get one from your little girl next time ? You cunt, listen to me now... You get near her again, and I rip off your dick and shove it up your ass ! Give me the money and everything'll be fine. So you can come for more in a few weeks ? You won't hear from me again, ever. Listen... Next time you're scrubbing those fucking pots, think of me. Because this is the farthest you got in life, buddy... - Yeah sure. - Is that clear ? Now fuck off, you cunt. - Do you need any help ? - No, thanks. Hanka... I know a lot of things were said, and I probably got on your nerves a lot... But I never wished you anything bad. Thank you, Marketa. I'm really sorry... About everything. Ms. Sikorova ? - Do you have a moment ? - What is it ? Could you let us upstairs ? We need to make an announcement on the PA. I don't have the keys, but the mayor will let you in. Hello, what do you need ? Could you let us upstairs ? We need to make an announcement on the PA. Sure, come in. Fellow citizens. Please pay attention to this community radio broadcast. The Czech Police have an important announcement for you. This is Captain Rajner. We ask all males aged 15 and older, who are permanent residents of Pustina to appear on Friday, May 16, from 6 p.m. onward, at the municipal office... What's he saying... ... in connection with the investigation of the murder of Michaela Sikorova. DNA samples will be taken. Citizens who cannot appear for testing at the designated time will inform town council of the fact immediately. End of episode 7
