 He looks quite calm. Are you still at the cottage ? Yeah, we're here. The guys are still inspecting the well. Stay there with them. What about Sikorova ? Yeah, she's here too. What should I tell her about Sikora ? Tell her that we detained him, he's being questioned, but that we haven't pressed charges yet. And I'm sending our psychologist.

 WASTELAND Episode 5 You know why I stopped teaching ? No one listens. You keep trying to say something meaningful. Start a dialogue. But no one pays any attention. - I'm listening. - Yeah ? I keep telling you to let me go. I have to look for my daughter. - And you don't care. - First I need answers from you. What if you answer me, captain ? One simple question... Wait a second. I ask the questions, you give me answers. Those are the rules here. Rules are the basis for everything, captain. You know I'm a teacher. I know something about rules. I respect rules. This will be the only exception. Will you allow me ? I need the answer to one simple question.

 And then I'll know we have an understanding. Fine. Am I crazy, or not ? Of course, you're not. My turn. I'd like to know what's on these pictures. It's fine ! Put the table back. If you need anything, we're right outside. So shall we sit down again ? We both want to find out what happened to your daughter. What do these pictures have to do with it ? What's on them ? Old mattresses. They were moldy. So I burned them. Why'd you burn them in front of the cottage ? You have a fire pit out back. I guess I didn't want to drag them so far. It's not that much farther to the garden. When did you burn them ? I would really love to tell you, captain. But I don't know. How many days are there from last year that you remember exactly what you did ? - How many ? - There's definitely a few I'd remember. I remember only one day. Friday, April 16th. You know why ? Because I gave my wife and kids the best gift I could have given them. I left the house. I let them be. When you ask me when I burned some mattresses, I can't tell you. Maybe Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, yesterday, I have no idea. Could it have been the day Misha disappeared ? - Maybe. What does it matter ? - Why did you leave your family ? Because I'm not selfish. Leaving your family is an act of unselfishness ? Are you married, captain ? How many times did you cheat on her ? And how many times did you lie to your children ? And why ? Just out of fear of being alone. You lie to yourself that you do it all for them, but really you just do it for yourself. You know what happened at the daycare last week ? You mean the donkey ? I bought it for her. Did she tell you ? It was my idea, and my foolishness. I should have known what would happen. Why should you have known ? An animal like that provokes that kind of attention. Provokes what kind of attention ? When you were a kid, did you throw rocks at dogs ? At what kinds ? The neighbor's German Shepherd that you were scared of, or the stray mutt that only whimpered ? You must have noticed this before in your line of work, captain. The weak make us want to hurt them even more. Is that how you feel ? What were you doing the afternoon that your daughter went missing ? I was probably at the cottage. - With who ? - Alone. We have the testimony of someone, who was with you at that time. So, with whom did you spend that Wednesday afternoon ? - No one. I was alone. - How did you get those injuries ? I slipped and fell, I told you already. So you were walking along, you tripped, fell, and busted your nose. You see what kind of person you are ? You promised to listen to me. And instead you just keep asking me about my banged up face. It's the only thing that interests you. I'm interested in anything that could be connected to your daughter's disappearance. Bullshit. You think I did something to her. And you're so pathetic you don't even try to hide it. - And did you do something to her ? - How dare you, you cunt ! - Grab him ! - Let me go ! I have to find Misha ! - I have to find my daughter ! - Get him out of here. - Let me go ! - Take it easy. Let me out ! Let me out ! Oh man... Pepa ! Cell three, move ! Don't be stupid ! Don't do anything ! Let me out ! I have to find my daughter, I have to help her ! I'll call the boss, okay ? You can talk it over. Go get him. He'll be right here, just take it easy. I have to find my daughter ! Can you fucking understand that ? I completely understand. He is coming. Wait outside. - Mr. Sikora... - Let me out. I'm sorry, that's not possible now. You have 5 seconds, then I stab myself. - Mr. Sikora... - Five. - Mr. Sikora, calm down. - Four. Three ! - Two ! - Your daughter is dead ! We found her in the well next to your cottage. Unfortunately, it was too late. I'm terribly sorry. It looks like she was murdered. And you're certainly not helping the investigation like this. - That's not true. Misha's alive. - Unfortunately not. You're lying. Well, fuck you ! That's not our Misha. You found someone else. Open the door for me. Come with me. It's now 8:28 p.m., we are continuing the inspection of the scene where the object was found in the well by house number four. Having been removed from the well the object can be clearly identified as a female body. A post-mortem of the deceased will be carried out by MD. Kopecky from the Department of Forensic Medicine of Liberec Regional Hospital. - Doctor, if you please. - A female body, 13 to 16 years of age. The body is lying on the back, the head facing upwards at the time of this examination. The left upper limb is slightly bent at the elbow along the body with the palm turned to the body, fingers slightly bent, probably due to rigor mortis. The right upper limb is spread out, outstretched... But that's not our Misha. What are you trying to pull on me ? That's your cottage, your well. You want tell me you don't remember it ? That girl in the well is not our Misha. - And who is it then ? - That's for you to find out. Alright. Fine. Come with me. Come on. Go get his stuff. Vasek, we've got a cock-up. Sikorova's disappeared, we tried her house she's nowhere to be found. Her phone is unavailable. Mr. Sikora. We can't find your wife. She was with us at your cottage, she didn't come home. Her phone number is unavailable. Do you have any idea where she could be ? Check all her friends, relatives. Just find her. - I'll be on the phone. - Sure. Let's go. - Hello. - Hello, hello. - We're here to see the young girl. - Right, come in, I was expecting you. I'll get her myself. Just a sec. Wait a moment. Jana, where's that Sikorova ? I don't know, isn't she already in autopsy ? Yeah, that's her. You can't do that. Goodbye. There's something we have to set straight, right ? From Monday. On Monday, you requested Toni Braxton's song "Unbreak my Heart", but none of your friends heard it, including an important someone... Yes, yes, yes... A friend of mine, named Irena, has her name day on Saturday, so I would like to dedicate it to her as well, as a present, wishing her all the best, good health, good luck, and I hope she enjoys it since she missed it on Monday. Right, okay, well I have it ready here, it's dedicated to you as well, so nobody breaks your heart. So here's Toni Braxton, Unbreak my Heart and I hope to hear from you again. Bye. Get up. Here's your stuff. Mr. Sikora, the state prosecutor found no cause to keep you in custody, so we have to let you go. Sign this here. In any case, do not leave Pustina. - Who did it to her ? - Don't worry, we'll find out. Get moving ! Goodbye. - I know, I'll show you. - Look. Hello. He doesn't even respond. Look, it's Karel. Do you think he... Hi. - Thank you. - Hello. - To the pig farm. - 26 crowns. I'll pay you back. And how do I track you down ? Pay or walk. What's it gonna be ? We have to go. - How much do you need ? - 7 crowns. - As if you'd have come up short. - Thank you. - The ticket. - Stuff it. Oh man... - Delete it. - Delete what ? - You know what. The photo. - I didn't take any photos. - Don't lie. Give it to me. - What are you doing ? Jesus, leave her alone, are you crazy ? Do you hear me ? Stop it. - Give it here. Let go. - Ouch, stop it ! Give me that phone ! Give me that. Right now ! Now you're going to harass girls in here you sick bastard ? Go, get out ! - I'm going home. - Home ? Your home is in an nuthouse, motherfucker. You should have been locked up ages ago ! I said get out ! Or should I call the cops ? I'm going home. - Get out, I'm telling you, move. - What are you doing ? Have you lost your mind, Lojza ? You could have killed him. Go sit down ! Or do you want take a hike, too ? How dare you ! Asshole. Jerk. Franta ? Franta ! Were you here yesterday ? Did you see them ? Did they find our Misha here ? - There, in the well. - Did you talk to the police ? Did they tell you... What are you doing ? - Go, get out of here. In peace. - Are you crazy ? Lipovska speaking, hello, Sikora is here, and he's threatening us. They didn't talk to us. We don't know anything. I just need to know what happened here. It'll get all dirty from the wheels. Where are Hana and Klara ? - They're not here. - Oh come on... Karel, wait ! Go away, Klara doesn't want to talk to you.

What should I tell her about Sikora ? That we detained him, he's being questioned, but that we haven't pressed charges yet. I'm sending our psychologist. He should be there within an hour. Right, okay. Bye. Ms. Sikorova, we've detained your husband. Captain Rajner is in town questioning him. It's just an interrogation, he hasn't been charged with anything yet. Your daughter, Klara, doesn't know yet. Do you want to tell her yourself, or should we do it ? - Lieutenant, can I have a word ? - Yeah, sure. Hani... Hanka ? Hani ? Hani, can you hear me ?
