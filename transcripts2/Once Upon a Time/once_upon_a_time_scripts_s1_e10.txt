 NARRATOR: Once upon a time, an evil queen banished every storybook character you've ever known to our world. HENRY: They don't remember who they are. NARRATOR: Only one knows the truth and only one can break her spell. If you need anything... - You'll find me. - Always. You belong together. You're the only thing in this whole place that feels right. No one comes here. Ever. Any place to get a room around here? You're staying?

 That's the plan. (THUNDER RUMBLING) What are you doing here? Fixing my bike. No. I mean in Storybrooke. Just visiting. What's that? A box. What's inside it? Just something I need to do what I came here for. I thought you were just visiting. Doesn't mean I don't have something to do. (ENGINE REVS) Henry?

 You better get to school. Looks like a storm is coming. Henry. Who was that? MAN ON TV: Top of the morning. This is chief meteorologist Bill Goslyn with your up to the minute Storybrooke weather. Break out those galoshes, folks. It's gonna get soggy. We've got a major storm system moving up the coast, - (GRUNTS) - And the latest Doppler Radar shows the worst band of precipitation coming into Storybrooke right about the time you're putting the kids... I cannot believe I overslept. It's only 7:10, you've got plenty of time to get to school. No, I have to be there at 7:15. Science fair. I'm helping the kids with their project before school. I'm sure if you're five minutes late, they'll live. We're making a volcano. - Okay. - (DOOR CLOSES) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (DOOR BELLS JINGLE) (DOOR BELLS JINGLING) One cream and sugar. One black. Thank you. Good morning. Morning. I should go, I'm gonna be late for work. The animal shelter, right? How's that going? Well, the apes haven't taken over. Yet. (LAUGHS) Not on my watch. (LAUGHS) (DOOR BELLS JINGLE) (DOOR CLOSES) (INAUDIBLE) This is "making a volcano"? I was... I get it. He comes here every morning at 7:15 a.m. to get coffee. For him and his wife. I know. I know. I know. I just like to come here to see him. So, you're a stalker. No, not really. Maybe a little bit. I mean, it's not like I'm following him. I just know that he spends his mornings with Kathryn. Gets coffee. Then drives to the animal shelter to start work at 7:30. And then he's home around 5:00. Is that all? Thursdays they pick up Chinese for dinner. I can't get him out of my head. I know. Maybe the first step is not showing up here tomorrow. Love is the worst. I wish there was a magic cure. (RUSTLING) Hey! It's me. Red. The spear, Snow? Oh. Sorry. (SIGHS) - I wasn't expecting you for a month. - It's been a month. Has it? You're really taking well to the solitude, aren't you? It's fine. It's exactly what I wanted. To be out here. Away. And that you are. Here you go. Thank you. So, how are things back in the world? Come on. Ask what you really want. I don't know what you mean. Okay. Fine. Tell me. The wedding is happening. Prince James is marrying Midas' daughter. In two days' time. You okay? I just thought the longer I was out here the easier it would be to forget him. But, instead, all I do is think about him. I'm sorry. I wish there was a way to get him out of my head. What? Ls there? Of course not. I mean, that would be... Red, what do you know? Come on, I helped you when no one else would. What do you know? Well, there are whispers. Whispers of a man who can achieve even the most unholy of requests. A man who can do what you ask. Who is this man? RUMPLESTILTSKIN: How much for this? Excuse me? Your boat. Exquisite craftsmanship. It's not for sale. Of course it is, dearie. No one comes to see me without a deal in mind. So, you're Rumplestiltskin. Indeed, I am. I've been looking forward to meeting you. Wow. You really are the fairest of them all, aren't you? What can I do for you? I need a cure. What ails you, child? A broken heart. Ah! The most painful of afflictions. Well, I'm afraid if you want me to make him love you, no can do. Nothing can. No, that's not the problem. We can't be together. Now that, I can help you with. (GIGGLES) That'll do it? Not yet. No two loves are exactly alike. We must make this - personal. - (GASPS) (GIGGLES) So, if I drink that, I'll no longer love him? The next time you see the object of your grief, you won't even remember who he is. Won't remember him? Love is the most powerful magic, so the cure must be extreme. Extreme sounds like an understatement. Don't doubt yourself now, dearie. Love makes us sick. It haunts our dreams, destroys our days. Love has killed more than any disease. This cure is a gift. What's your price? These will do. What do you need of my hair? What do you need of it, now it's been plucked from your head? Do we have a deal? I thought so. Drink it in good health, Snow White. (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV) - (BOTH EXCLAIM) - (CHUCKLES) - I'm so sorry. - It's fine. Don't worry about it. - I wasn't looking. - Clearly. Oh, is this yours? Yes, thank you. And this must... Good luck. Thank you. I trust you'll be discreet. Their lives are their business. Not yours. (MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) James. How goes the feast? Your absence is felt. It is, after all, in your honor. I thought this might rouse you from your chamber. You could feed the kingdom for an entire winter with that crown. It's a gift. From King Midas. For you to wear as you marry his daughter. Once that is done, our new prosperity will allow us to feed the kingdom for all eternity. Show some enthusiasm. Enthusiasm wasn't part of the deal. The wedding is in two days. I have honored your wishes. Well, I want your heart, not just your honor. My heart shall belong to Abigail. You think I'm a fool, don't you? Your heart can't belong to Abigail when it's held by another woman. And don't deny it. I know that look. Who is she? I met her on a journey. We haven't seen each other since, but she's stayed with me. Forget her. You speak as if that's so easy. Nobility was not meant to be easy. All this wealth? The power we hold over other men's lives? Do you think that comes at no cost? I asked for none of it. You were chosen. To be my son. Plucked from poverty, wanting for nothing. Be thankful for that. It wasn't charity, Father. It was the only way to save your kingdom. Watch yourself, boy. This is a choice you made, a role you have taken. Honor it. There is too much at stake. Do whatever it takes to get that woman out of your head, because nothing is gonna stop this wedding. Dearest Snow. Find her. (DOVE COOING) (WINGS FLAPPING) (COOING CONTINUES) Oh! Hey. (SIGHS) How did you manage to get yourself... Come on. It's gonna be okay. Well, the good news is, no broken bones. She was just a little dehydrated. But I got her some fluids and she should be just fine. And the bad news? Well, this is a North Atlantic dove. It's a migratory species, very unique among American doves. They tend to form strong, monogamous bonds, meaning... If I don't get her back to her flock, she'll be alone forever. Well, it's a long shot, but the alternative, she'll heal but she won't be happy here. I'll take my chances. Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. Good luck. Mary Margaret, there's a storm coming. You really shouldn't go out there. Well, the storm's coming tomorrow. And if I wait, she could be lost forever. Completely alone. No one deserves that. Then let me drive you. I don't need your help, David. I'll be fine. - (DOOR OPENS) - (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSES) MAN ON RADIO: Storybrooke has seen wind gusts of up to 50 miles an hour. Your best bet is to stay in the house... (RADIO SHUTS OFF) If you're looking to blame me for the storm, I think you're taking things a bit far now. I need you to look into something, Sheriff. Someone's in town. Someone new. Yeah. I know. I gave him directions to Granny's the other night. You talked to him? What did he say? He asked for directions. What's the big deal? Who is he? I don't know. I've asked around, but no one seems to know anything. There's something about him. Something familiar. He must be one of the untold millions you cursed. What? Oh, you know, the curse. Henry's whole thing. Sheriff, I need you to find out who he is. What he wants. And what he's doing here. You know, as hard as you tried to find one in my case, there is no law against visiting Storybrooke. - This isn't about the law, Ms. Swan. - (THUNDER RUMBLING) You're gonna do this because I asked you to. And because you'll see it's the right thing to do. And why is that? Because he was in front of my house. Taking a particular interest in the one thing we both care about. Henry. I'll look into him. (THUNDERCLAP) (THUNDER CRASHES) (COOING) PRINCE CHARMING: Dearest Snow, I've not heard from you since our meeting, and can only assume you found the happiness you so desired. But I must let you know, not a day goes by that I have not thought of you. In two days' time, I'm to be married. Come to me before then. Come to me and show me you feel the same, and we can be together forever. And if you don't, I'll have my answer. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Well, the ﬂock can't be much further. We just have to beat this storm. They're waiting for you. (HORSE WHINNIES) MAN: Why aren't you at the stables yet? Must I have a guard drag you there? And you, go with him. King George's carriage must be spotless for tomorrow's journey. Flowers for Prince James from the kingdom of Midas. Top of the northeast spire. Take the service stairwell or the guards will toss you over the walls. (DOOR OPENS) (MUFFLED SCREAM) (GRUNTING) Wait. I'm a Royal emissary. Sure you are. The King will decide your fate. (GRUNTS) (RATTLING) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (COUGHS) Oh... (WHISTLING) Who's there? What are you looking at, sister? Tried it all. Steel gets stronger as we grow weaker. Well, I am not giving up. Give it time. Grumpy. (SIGHS) I'm not grumpy. I'm focused. No. My name. Grumpy. And I'm telling you, there's no way out. Well, I'm Snow. And I'll find one. If you say so. SNOW WHITE: There's someone out there for me. Someone I love very much and I will not lose him. GRUMPY: Love, huh? Good luck with that. What do you know about it? It's why I'm stuck in this hole. (SNOW WHITE GROANS) I had it bad. She was beautiful as a fairy but I lost her. I was desperate to get her back. So I came up with a plan. I worked at the diamond mines. I traded all my wages to the foreman for a diamond to propose. But I got swindled. It was a stolen rock and I took the blame. I'm no thief, but they think I am. I should've known better, but I wasn't thinking clearly. All 'cause of love. Now, here I am, trapped, with no way out. MAN: I know a way out. Stealthy? You ready to go home? How did you get in here? Doc whipped up a sleeping gas, knocked all the guards out cold. The rest are waiting with transport. There's more of you? Who's that? She pretty. No one. Come on, let's go. Grumpy, good luck. I hope you get your love back. Son of a... Give me that. (KEYS JANGLING) Come on. (DOVES COOING IN DISTANCE) Do you hear that? Your flock. (WINGS FLAPPING) (WIND WHISTLING) (THUNDERCLAP) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Here. David? Grab my hand. Hold tight. (BOTH GRUNT) Come on. You really think I'd let you come out here alone? You okay? I'm fine, thanks. DAVID: Where are you going? MARY: I came to find the flock. DAVID: And I came here to get you before you got hurt. (THUNDERCLAP) We have to go. (PANTING) No! Doing this on foot is not the best plan. The gate was closed. I know. I saw. It's too late. We have to go. - No, but the... - Mary Margaret, it's not safe. - We need to get out of here. Come on. - (THUNDER CRASHES) (THUNDERCLAP) (WHISPERS) Wait, wait! Stairs! No, we sneak out through the courtyard. No, it's safer if we climb over the curtain wall. Trust me, hiding from royals is my life. No, the courtyard is clear now, but it won't be for much longer. Sorry, lady, Stealthy got me this far. Grumpy. Grumpy, wait! Halt! Those two are prisoners! Grumpy! Run! We can make it. Stealthy, no! - (THUDDING) - (GASPS) No! (SOBBING) Where is the girl? What girl? Kill him. SNOW WHITE: Looking for me? Let him go, or this place will burn. Begone, dwarf. SNOW WHITE: Go, Grumpy! (GRUNTS) Now, Snow White. We need to talk. (THUNDERCLAP) There! Come on. Hello? Hello, is anyone in there? It's empty. (DOOR RATTLES) (MARY SHIVERS) (EXHALES) (FLAMES CRACKLING) (SIGHS) Okay. Let's get you dry. Whose cabin is this? You sure it's okay for us to be in here? Well, you're roommates with the sheriff, so I doubt she'll arrest us for breaking and entering. Here. Hey, I'm just trying to help. What's going on with you today? (THUNDER RUMBLES) What's going on? What's going on is I still have feelings for you. What? Why do you think I go to Granny's every morning at 7:15? It's to see you. And I don't know why. Because it just makes me miserable, because every time I see you, it just reminds me that you chose Kathryn instead of me. And that's why I didn't want you to come to the woods with me. Because being around you is too... (SIGHS) It's too painful. (CHUCKLES) - You think this is funny? - No! No, it's just... The reason I go to Granny's every morning at 7:15 is to see you. Oh... (THUNDER RUMBLING) How can you do this? What are you talking about? David, I know. - You know what? - About Kathryn. What about Kathryn? That she thinks she's pregnant. What? (THUNDER RUMBLING) (DOOR BELLS JINGLE) (EXHALES) EMMA: We need to talk. Why? Because you're suspicious. Sitting here. Out in the open. Drinking coffee. Wonder what kind of hell I would've raised had I ordered a donut. You were talking to Henry. You mean the little kid who came up to me asking me questions? Is that unusual for him? Being curious and precocious? What were you doing outside his house? My bike broke down. It happens. Your mysterious box. What's in it? It's awfully frustrating not knowing, isn't it? Just tell me. Why? Is it illegal to carry around a box in these parts? No, of course it's not. You really wanna know what's inside it, don't you? No! Well, maybe. I'm gonna make you wait. You're gonna have to wait a long time and watch me carry it around. Hauling it to strange and mysterious places. And with each passing moment, the mystery will become more tantalizing. Your imagination will inflame, but so will your frustration. Never knowing, only guessing, what could possibly be inside that box? Or, you could let me buy you a drink sometime and I'll tell you right now. You wanna buy me a drink. Yes. Okay. A drink it is. Really? I'm a writer. That's why you're here? I find this place provides inspiration. Don't you? (THUNDERCLAP) Wait. Have you been here before? I didn't say that. What about that drink? I said "sometime." (THUNDER RUMBLING) You didn't know. No. And you two aren't trying... Not as far as I know. Mary Margaret, you have to believe me. Shh. David. The rain stopped. I need to get her out. No... Mary Margaret. Mary Margaret, please. Can we at least talk... Shh! Listen. (WINGS FLAPPING) (DOVES COOING) The flock, they didn't leave. They must've been waiting for the storm to clear. MARY: Okay. Okay, girl. Time to join your friends. You can do it. (LAUGHS) No, David. It's too painful. (SIGHS) It doesn't have to be. We don't know Kathryn's pregnant. Doesn't matter. You chose her. I know. But I still have feelings for you. You can't have both. But I do have both. I know. I know it doesn't make sense. But it's like I have these two conﬂicting lives. Memories of feelings for her, and real feelings for you. Who's to say which is real? I can't get you out of my head. I know. Me too. But we're going to have to. We're just going to have to forget each other. So you're the one. I don't know what you're... Enough. I know everything. You've poisoned his heart, now his marriage. And with that, the entire kingdom. All because of your feelings. I wish feelings could be helped, but they can't. Of course they can. Love is a disease. And like all diseases it can be vanquished in one of two ways. A cure, or death. Do you know where your beloved is right now? He's right down that hallway, packing for his new life. And he'll never know I'm here. Oh, yes, he will. Because you are gonna walk down that hallway, Snow White. You're gonna sneak in and tell him you received his letter. You're gonna tell him why you're here. Because you don't love him. It'll break his heart. And that will cure him. Or you'll kill me. Oh, no. I'll kill him. Killing you would just make him love you more and the marriage and the kingdom would ultimately crumble. But if he were to die at an assassin's hand, he would die a martyr. Midas would forgive even laud, the death. And the merger would be complete. You would do that to your own son? He is not my son. James. Snow. I got your letter. You came. You came! You came! (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) You came. (SIGHS) Wait, James. US. It can't happen. What's wrong? Of course it can. You're here. We can go. We can be together. We can leave all this. I know there are costs, but I've planned for everything. They can't hurt us. And now that I know that you love me too... I don't. What? Love you. I don't. I'm sorry. You said I would always be in your heart and that is too cruel a fate. Go live your life. Live it without me because there is no place for us together. And fill your heart with love for someone else. Someone who can love you the way I never have. The way I never will. (KATHRYN SIGHS) Anything you wanna tell me? What do you mean? Something's up. Isn't it? What? I feel like ever since you've come home, you're here, but you're not here. I know you say you're trying and I know you've been through a lot, but... No, no, Kathryn... No, David, please. Just let me finish. I know it's been hard on you, but it's also been hard on me. I want a family with you someday. I want children. I'll be honest. I thought I was pregnant. And when the test came back negative, at first I was upset, but then I was relieved. We're not ready. If I was pregnant now, it would be a disaster. Yeah. - But I wanna fix this. I wanna fix us. - Me too. Do you? Well, then let's go see Dr. Hopper. Let's get some help. Will you do that? Will you give us our best shot? Yeah. Look, you and I, I know we're... I know we should be in love. And I wanna make that work. It's 7110. We should get going if you want your coffee before work. No. Why don't we go downstairs and have some breakfast instead? - Okay. - All right. You okay, sister? (VOICE BREAKS) Not even close. You didn't find him? Worse. I lost him. Come on. Where are you taking me? Home. We all lost someone today. Now we're seven. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So you're coming home with us, Snow. And we're gonna protect you. The only thing that needed protecting is destroyed. My heart. It will get better. Yes. Yes, it will. This will take all of my feelings. All of my pain. - And destroy them. - No. Why? You of all people should understand. You've lost love. What if your pain could be erased? I don't want my pain erased. As wretched as it is, I need my pain. It makes me who I am. It makes me Grumpy. Look around, Snow. You're not alone any more. I promise you, that's all the cure you need. If the pain is too much, you can always drink it. But for today? Put it away. Okay. Come on, you. Snow! Snow White! - Snow! Are you there? - (HORSE WHINNIES) She's gone. She never came back after she went to find you. Then I'll find her. I will always find her. Where's Snow? Where is she? Snow! Snow! The royal wedding! The kingdom's abuzz! It's off, Snow. He left her. James left Abigail! Did you hear me? Your Prince Charming isn't getting married. Who? Thanks, Ruby. (DOOR BELLS JINGLE) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) What are you doing? - It's 7:45. - I know! - Well, I'm trying not to see you. - Well, I am trying not to see you. Well, how do we stop seeing each other? Apparently, we can't. - This is a problem. - Yes. She's not pregnant.
