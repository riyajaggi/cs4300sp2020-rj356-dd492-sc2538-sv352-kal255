 There is a town in Maine... I'd like a room. Welcome to Storybrooke. Where every storybook character you've ever known... Is trapped between two worlds. An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here? And now they don't remember who they are. Victims of a powerful curse. Everything you love, everything all of you love, will be taken from you.

Once Upon A Time: "The Shepherd" Season 1 Episode 6 Original air date December 4, 2011 You know, you had that same look on your face before we bought it, too. You couldn't see past the ugly windmill on the lawn, and said you'd never buy an old lady house. Do you remember what made you change your mind? Well, I see the windmill's gone. Come on. Everyone's waiting. Who's everyone?

 - This is Jay. - Good to see you. David. How are you doing? And this is Ellen, his wife. - Ellen, hi. - Pleased to meet you, too. Welcome home, David. Hey. - Hey. - Dr. Whale. - Hi, David. - Hi. Look, I know this is a lot, but it's good for you. The smallest thing could trigger your memories. Just try and have fun. Thank you, Dr. Whale. I'll do my best. You know why he doesn't remember? The curse isn't working on him yet. Henry, David has amnesia. Which is preventing the curse from replacing his fairy tale story with fake memories. Right. Because everyone here has fake stories that prevent them from remembering who they really are. Right. And now's our chance to help him. We just have to get him to remember that he... He's Prince Charming. We just have to jog his memory by getting him and Ms. Blanchard together. Didn't we just try that? And it woke him up. Hey. You're the ones who saved me, right? Oh. Yeah, I guess. And you're also the only ones I know here. You can hide with us. Fantastic. Thank you. So, you ever use a sword? I'm sorry? Emma, you live with Mary Margaret, right? You know if she's coming tonight? No, she couldn't make it. You should go out there. There's plenty of food. Go. Be with your husband. I lost him once. Now I have him back. But it's like I still don't have him back. You have no idea how that feels. Actually, I do. I lost someone once, too. - Really? - Yes. But the love I lost, there's no bringing him back. You have a chance here. Go to him. You're right. And, Regina, thank you. Thank you for being such a good friend. It's been so lonely, I'm not used to having one. Neither am I. Well, like it or not, you have one now. Have you seen David? Uh... He... No. Did you not get the invite? David! Here. So I heard you resigned from the hospital. Was it me? Because of what I told you. About how I felt. About you. Come on. Don't tell me it's one-sided. You're married. It should be no-sided. What it should be doesn't matter. Whoever married Kathryn, it's not me. I didn't choose her. I'm choosing you. I know you feel it. I can tell. I know you think that we have this connection, but maybe it's because I happen to be the person who saved your life. So why don't we leave it at that? Ah! Next time, make sure I'm really dead. Well done. Well done? There's an understatement. Did you see what my son did to that brute? He just killed the unkillable. A valiant feat for sure. But it is still just a man. Can he do the same with a dragon? Do fairies sprinkle dust? Do trolls live under bridges? Father, relax. I can kill whatever beast you set after me. My kingdom is plagued by a dragon like nothing you've ever faced before. He has killed every warrior that's tried to slay him. He's yet to face me. My kingdom needs this threat vanquished. And my kingdom needs gold. I'm sure we can work something out. Careful. Remember what happened to Frederick. Your sword. Consider it a down payment. You'll get the rest when you deliver the dragon's head to me. It's a deal. Forgive me if I refuse to shake on it, King Midas. Come. Let's discuss the details. A toast to our fearless Prince! No. There's no celebrating today. This was but a simple test. The task before us is too big, too important to make light of. Just because I was easily able to kill this brute doesn't mean... Goodbye, my son. Your Majesty, there is no time to grieve. If Midas learns he is dead, he will find another warrior to slay his dragon. And we will never see an ounce of his gold. Yes. Yes. The kingdom must survive. So what are we to do? I have asked for help. It should be here soon. Oh, it's here. Leave us. Move. So this is how you treat my gifts? You really must be more careful. He was not a gift. He was my son. A son I gave you. In a deal we made. You did me no favors. Yes. Yes, I did. Shame you and the Queen couldn't conceive a child on your own. My price for that was a pittance. But now that she is gone, well, I assume that conceiving another heir is out of the question, let alone a dragon slayer. Then let's do another deal. Bring him back. I need my son to do this. I'll give you anything. Anything? What do you want? There's a magic wand I desire. It belongs to a certain Fairy Godmother who's patron to your family. I want to know her whereabouts. Done. Now tell me. How do I bring my son back to slay the dragon? Bring him back? No, that's out of the question. He's dead. Magic can do much, but not that. But you just said... Nothing about resurrection. Then my kingdom is lost. I'm alone. Oh, dear. Oh, dearie, dearie, dear. Did I not tell you that I could have your son slay the dragon? And am I not a man of my word? I thought you said he was gone forever! Oh, that he is. But his brother... His what? His twin brother. Did I not mention there was another? You might want to ease up or that Brillo Pad's gonna press charges. The dishes were just piling up. This have anything to do with David stopping by? I saw him sulking away as I pulled up. We just... He just... I know what your both "just." And you did the right thing. He made a pretty compelling case. But he's still married. I know. I was just at the party. What do I do? You need to stop cleaning and have a drink. Here's the thing. I don't know a lot about relationships, other than having many that failed. But generally speaking, if you think something you wanna do is wrong, it is. So you gotta stay strong, and he has to figure out his life. Cheers. You look different. Your hair. It's longer. You used to always have a buzz cut. You used to complain that long hair was itchy and hard to take care of. I guess it grew while I was in there. So, I was gonna go to bed. Do you want to join me? You mean "go to bed" go to bed or "go to bed"? Whatever you want. Why don't we just sit and talk some more? This... isn't right. This way. Come on. Come. Come on. Hey. Ah! Didn't see that coming, did you? Honey! Mother, how was the market? It was interesting. Interesting? Normally you come back cursing the prices. Oh, well, that's still the case. In there. But this time, I had a very interesting talk with the grain merchant. Grain? We don't need any grain. He has a daughter. She's ready for marriage. He thinks the two of you would make a great couple. Mother! I know, I know. I hate myself for even bringing it up. Let me guess? She has a dowry that would save the farm? We are running out of options. Mother, please. As poor as we are, love is one thing I can afford. I will find a way to save this farm. But I won't do it by marrying for riches. When I marry, I want it to be because I choose to spend the rest of my life with someone I love. When are you going to learn? You can't have everything. Well, perhaps he can. A twin brother? And you gave him to that man? We were poor, barely surviving. Then he came along with an offer. One of you for the farm. Why didn't you ever tell me? The deal forbade us from ever speaking of it. Your father regretted the decision the minute that man took your brother. He carried the guilt with him to his grave. Hate to interrupt this tender moment. Time is of the essence. Mother, wait in the house while I deal with this. What do you want from me? Not me, dear. The King. He needs a Prince to slay a dragon. I'm not a dragon slayer. No, but your brother was. This newfound kinship will be your salvation. Simply play the part the King's knights will take care of everything else. All you must do is deliver the dragon's head to Midas. What's in it for you? What's in it for me is my business. You should be asking yourself what's in it for you. You do this, your poor mother... Well, the King is gonna make sure she never wants for anything ever again. Your farm will be saved. And you, should you survive, you shall come home the conquering hero. Now don't tell me you don't want that. I don't have a choice, do I? Oh, everyone has a choice, dearie. Just make sure it's the right one. I'm a hell of a doctor, huh? No way he wakes up on someone else's watch. Hello, Dr. Whale. So I heard that you resigned from the hospital. I hope it wasn't because of me. Why would it be because of you? Well, our date. I never called you after. Yeah. I know. I know, it's not classy. And I'm sorry. But if you can find a way to get over it, you know where to find me. Have a good day. Ms. Blanchard, may I have a word? Of course. I wanted to talk to you about my friend, Kathryn. But more specifically, I wanted to talk to you about her husband, David. You don't belong together. He's not yours. He's taken. Find somebody else. I haven't done anything. Really? So he just up and left his wife on a whim? He did what? You don't know. Well, I suspect you soon will. So listen carefully, dear, because it's in your best interest. Stay away. He's in a fragile state. He doesn't know who he is or what he's doing. And you're this close to wrecking multiple lives. So before you do something that can't be undone, let him remember who he was. There he is. Our savior! The man who is going to tear the dragon limb from limb. You do this and you'll be a legend. Here, let me. You fastened it wrong. Here, give me that. How will I fight? How will I protect myself? You won't. You will stay outside the cave while we kill the dragon. If you don't come out of this alive, Midas won't give our kingdom any gold. You might have the title of hero, but not the job. The dragon's lair is through there. You stay here. We'll be back. Did you know him well? Who? My brother, the Prince. Yeah, we knew him. He was the bravest man I ever met. They need our help. We stay here. Our orders are clear. - People are dying! - Don't move! Stay back! Hey! Where's your sword? Stay here. Stay. Didn't see that coming, did you? Careful. Looks sharp. You can't be here. I needed to see you. Tell me you didn't leave your wife because of me. I do not want to destroy your marriage. You're not. It's me. I don't want to hurt her either. But the most hurtful thing to Kathryn would be me pretending. She needs someone to feel about her the way I feel about you. I'm really trying hard to stay away from you. To do the right thing. Why is that the right thing? Because you already have a life. With someone I didn't choose. The man who chose that life, whoever married Kathryn, is gone. The man here wants someone else. You really have to leave me alone. Is that truly what you want? Go. Meet me tonight. At least think about it. I'll be at the bridge where you found me at 8:00. Think about it until then and then decide. If you don't show, I'll know. And I'll never bother you again. But if you choose this, if you choose us, you know where I'll be. Sometimes the clichÃ©s are true. Okay. What do you want? Remember when I said no night shifts? I need you to work tonight. Just this once. Why? I volunteer at an animal shelter and the supervisor's sick and someone needs to feed the dogs. Very lucky you bought a bear claw. Emma, can I talk to you for a minute? I'll just go patrol my office. Thanks. He left his wife. David. He left her. He left Kathryn! Okay, slow down. He did it for me. He wants me to be with him. He wants me to meet him tonight. That's... I mean, I'm trying so hard to be strong, but he just keeps coming. I mean, how do I stop it? You know, how do I let him down? What would you do? I'd go. What? Well, he left her. It's one thing to say that he wants you, but it's another to actually make a choice, and now he has. That's all you can ask for. Given her new friendship with Kathryn, I don't think Regina would be happy. All the more reason to do it. Good Lord, is this really happening? You tell me. He has done it. Everything you asked for and more. My son battled the dragon and prevailed. Bring it to the palace. Put it between the Chimera and the Mapinguari. We did it. We pulled it off. Yes. Now how much longer before I can return home? That's a discussion not for now. From this day forth, may that beast's head be a reminder to us of the valiant warrior who killed it. The bravest, most noble Prince I have ever met. You have earned my utmost respect. We treasure that respect, King Midas, just as we respect your treasure. Yes, yes. You were promised gold, and gold you shall have. But I did not get to where I am by thinking small. I stand before you now because I dared to dream big. I was not just looking for a dragon slayer. I was looking for the strongest warrior in the land. A hero. Someone who could unite the kingdoms. Someone I would be proud to call family. Bring her. Gentlemen, may I present my daughter, Abigail. Beyond gold, beyond anything, I value her most. I promised her I would only give her hand in marriage when I could find a companion worthy of her. And now, I have. He killed the dragon? I guess he'll do. And so, Prince James, I offer you my daughter's hand in marriage. King Midas, I am humbled by your generous offer, but I can't honestly say I'm... My son! Always so humble. If you say anything but yes, you will be responsible for the destruction of everyone and everything in our kingdom. You will marry this girl, or I will kill you. I will kill your mother. I will turn that farm to ash. Do you understand me? I'll take your silence for wisdom. Follow it. I know you'll make the right decision. - Mr. Nolan? - Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I was just heading home from work and I saw you. Are you lost? Yeah. Yeah, kind of. I'm looking for the toll bridge. Ah! Where you were found. Trying to jog your memory? No, I'm meeting someone. So you've made your choice? Yes. Well, I don't suppose I can convince you to change your mind? I can't change what I feel. No, of course not. Walk down the street to Mr. Gold's pawn shop. You'll find a fork in the road. Go left. It'll take you to a hiking trail that leads directly to the bridge. Thank you. For understanding. Good luck, David. I hope you find what you're looking for. Hello? Hello? Charming. I'm sorry? The mobile. Isn't it charming? Exquisitely designed. Masterfully crafted. I can get it down if you like. No, no, I mean, it's very nice, but actually I'm looking for the toll bridge. The Mayor said there was a fork in the road by your shop, but... Seems Ms. Mills has led you astray. Yeah. Yeah, you'd think the Mayor would know her own town. One would think. Out of the door, turn right, two blocks you'll find the trail. Can't miss it. Thank you. See something you like? Where did you get that? That old thing? That's been gathering dust for forever. I think... this belonged to me. Really? Are you sure? Yes. I remember. Mother. Oh, you're back! You're alive! - Yes. - Oh! Oh! I did it. Are you hurt? I've been so worried. I'm fine, Mother. Really. Look at you. Look at you! You look like... Like a... Oh, you look like a prince. Come inside. I'll make us some supper. You should see the house, the farm. The King is going to take care of us. He's already started... What? What's wrong? Midas wants to unite the kingdoms. By marrying me to his daughter. What? It makes the grain merchant's dowry look like sheep dung. No. You were right to turn down that offer, as you must this one, too. Every day you've been gone has shown me it was shameful of me to ever encourage you otherwise. Your freedom to choose is more important than anything. - I'll give up the farm. - No. They can't force you. Yes, they can. And because of our ruse, Midas can never really know who I am, which... We can't ever see each other again. Yes. Then don't do it. Run away. I can't. They will kill you. I lose you either way. At least I'll know you'll be happy. I already accepted Midas' offer. I didn't come here for advice, Mother. I came here to say goodbye. There's too much at stake. I couldn't let the kingdom suffer on my account. I couldn't let them hurt you. You were right about one thing. I can't have everything. My boy. My sweet, sweet boy. Give this to your wife to be. Mother, I don't love her. I don't even know her. I can't take this. Just because you don't know her doesn't mean you won't grow to love her. True love follows this ring wherever it goes, my son. I had it with your father. I've had it as your mother. - Now you will have it. Take it. - No. No. Take it, and I'll know, even if I never see you again, I'll know you'll find love. I'll know you'll be happy. You came. You sound surprised. In fact, you almost sound a bit disappointed. I remember. Kathryn? Everything... And you love her. I don't know. But I know I did. I remember how I felt. And... I think I have to honor that. And everything that you said to me... ls true. I do have feelings for you. Intense feelings. Feelings I don't quite understand. You're going back to her. It's the right thing to do. "The right thing to do" was not to lead me on. I know. So you've made your choice. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. This is volunteering? Plans changed. Regina needed me to... Sleep with her? No. Why were you sneaking out the window? Because she didn't want Henry to know. You did this with Henry in the house? He's sleeping. He doesn't know. Oh, my God, I wish I was Henry right now. This is disgusting. I really do work at an animal shelter. You can finish my shift. I'm done working nights. You were right. I did hate that windmill out front. You remember. How much do you remember? Enough. I know we weren't at a good place when I left. I know you thought I was leaving you, but I wasn't. I wanted to work things out. I just needed some time. Then I had my accident, and got much more time than I expected. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I know we have work to do. Let's see what happens. I'd like that. Let this mark the beginning of a new era, of a new kingdom, united and strong. An era of mutual prosperity. Abigail, James, as I stay to work out the particulars of our new land with King George, go to your new home at my palace. We'll be along shortly. And the celebration will be beyond your dreams. Thank you, Daddy. I trust that you know best. I'm glad you made the right decision, Son. Thank you, Father. Come. I'm tired of waiting. Then our journey shall begin. I thought we might take the scenic route. Smile, Son. You're on the road to true love. I told you the Troll Road would have been quicker. Are you even listening to me? Halt! There's something in the road. Rough day? Don't feel like talking. Come on, sometimes it's easier to talk to someone when you don't give a crap what they think. You ever walk into a situation where you know exactly what's going to happen? And then you go into it anyway. And then when what you were afraid of happens, you kick yourself because you should have known better. But that's just who you are. So you keep punishing yourself. No. How do you do that? By never doing what's expected. Keeps life interesting. Can I buy you a drink? You can buy me two.
