 There is a town in Maine... I'd like a room. Welcome to Storybrooke. Where every storybook character you've ever known... is trapped between two worlds. An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here? And now they don't remember who they are. Victims of a powerful curse. Everything you love, everything all of you love, will be taken from you.

 Only one knows the truth, and only one can break her spell. It's your destiny. You're gonna bring back the happy endings. You enjoy your stay. Once Upon A Time: "Snow Falls" Season 1 Episode 3 Original Airdate Nov. 6, 2011 Hyah! What do you think of the view, my dear? I've seen better. This is taking forever. I told you the Troll Road would've been quicker. And far less bumpy. Are you even listening to me?

 Yes, of course I am. Whoa! Whoa! Now what? Worry not, it's but a fallen tree. Fellows, shall we? My Lord, what is it? Look at these markings. This tree didn't fall. It's been cut. It's an ambush. Guards! Stop, thief! Please, help me! Hyah! Hyah! Show your face, you coward. You're a girl. Woman. You can't hide from me! Wherever you are, I will find you! Where were we? Something about you wanting 15 kids? Oh, good Lord, no. I meant in my class. Where I teach. You'll meet them tomorrow. They're coming to the hospital as part of the volunteer outreach program. Oh, yeah, that is a great program. I mean, obviously I don't want 15 kids of my own. I mean, not that I don't want kids, I do. I want kids, marriage, true love. I want it all. But that, of course, is wildly inappropriate for me to discuss on a first date. Hmm? Ruby! Yes, Mary Margaret? Check, please. Hey. You okay? Oh, in the world of tight spots I've been in, crashing in my car doesn't even rank in the top 10. You're sleeping here? Till I find a place. You decided to stay. For Henry. Yeah, I guess. This town doesn't seem to have many vacancies. None, actually. Is that normal? Must be the curse. Why are you out so late? Well, I'm a teacher, not a nun. I had a date. From the looks of things, it went well. As well as they ever do. Tell me he at least paid. Mmm-mmm. Well, I guess if true love was easy, we'd all have it. You know, if things get cramped, I do have a spare room. Thanks. I'm not really the roommate type. It's just not my thing. I do better on my own. Well, good night. Good luck with Henry. Yeah. Henry, we could really use your help with the decorations. Is Mr. Doe going to be okay, Miss Blanchard? His name is not John Doe, honey. That's just what they call people when they don't know who they are. Do you know who he is? No. I just bring him flowers on my rounds. What's wrong with him? I don't know. He's been like this as long as I've been volunteering. Does he have any family or friends? No one's claimed him. So, he's all alone? Yeah. It's quite sad. You sure you don't know him? Of course I'm sure. Come on. You shouldn't be in here. I found your father. Prince Charming. Henry... He's in the hospital in a coma. See this scar? He has one, too. So? Lots of people have scars. In the same place. Don't you see what this means? The curse is keeping them apart with the coma. Now they're stuck without each other. We have to tell Miss Blanchard we found her Prince Charming. Okay, kid. Telling someone their soul mate is in a coma is probably not helpful. Not having a happy ending is painful enough, but giving someone unrealistic hope is far worse. But what if I'm right? We know who they are, now they have to know. And how do you intend to make that happen? By reminding him. We have to get her to read their story to John Doe. Then maybe he'll remember who he is. Okay. Okay? Yeah. We'll do it, but we'll do it my way. Let me ask her. You want me to read to a coma patient? Henry thinks it will help him remember who he was. And who does he think he was? Prince Charming. And if I'm Snow White, he thinks me and him... He has a very active imagination. Which is the point. I can't talk him out of his beliefs. So we need to show him. Play along, do what he says, and then maybe, just maybe... He'll see that fairy tales are just that. That there's no such thing as love at first sight. Or first kiss. He'll see reality. Something like that. Sadly, this plan is rather genius. We get him to the truth without hurting him. I told him that we will all meet tomorrow for breakfast at Granny's, and you will give a full report. Well, I suppose I'll get ready for my date. I guess I'll have to do all the talking. Look, I know this is odd, but I'm doing it for a friend. So please just bear with me. "As the prince chased the thief on horseback "through the treacherous forest, "his betrothal crossed her arms and pouted, "wondering how many dreadful, boring minutes it would take "until they could resume their journey again. "The thief vaulted over a fallen juniper... "and stared into each other's eyes." "They didn't need words to express what they felt in their hearts." "For it was here, in the shadow of the Troll Bridge," "that their love was born." "For they knew, no matter how they were separated," "they would always..." No, I'm sure he's waking up. He... He grabbed my hand. Everything's steady. Same as it's always been. What were you doing in here? Oh, I was just reading him a story. Oh. Well, perhaps you dozed off. Perhaps you imagined it. No, I didn't imagine anything. Miss Blanchard, I can only tell you what I see which is nothing. Sometimes there are minor fluctuations in readings. Perhaps you heard the machine register something and misunderstood. Look, why don't you go home? Get some rest. If anything changes, I'll call you. Okay? Yes? It's Dr. Whale. You told me to call you if there was ever a change in our John Doe. Something's happened. What? One of our volunteers said he grabbed her. There was a slight fluctuation in brain activity. And who is this volunteer? Mary Margaret Blanchard. I told you I'd find you. No matter what you do, I will always find you. Is this the only way you can catch a woman? By entrapping her? It's the only way to catch thieving scum. Aren't you a real Prince Charming. I have a name, you know. Don't care. Charming suits you. Now cut me down, Charming. I'll release you when you return the leather pouch you stole with my jewels. Not the jewelry type. Indeed. I noticed. What is that supposed to mean? Are you insulting me? Quite right. My apologies. How dare I cast aspersions at the person who robbed me! Where are my jewels? I sold them. What? What do you care? Don't you have a palace full of treasures somewhere? These were special. Among them was a ring that belonged to my mother. A ring I was about to give to... The nag with the bad attitude? That's what this is about? She's my fiancée. Good luck with that. You must be getting something impressive to have agreed to that union. Excuse me? I know how this works. True love? It doesn't exist. It's all arranged marriages and business transactions. There's no such thing as love at first sight. Or first kiss. Let me guess. Her kingdom wants to take over yours. And this is, what, a last ditch effort to avoid war? This is not a takeover. It's a merger. And quite frankly, it's none of your business. - Now this is what's going to happen. - Mmm-hmm. I'm going to cut you down, and you will take me to whoever has my jewels, and then you're going to get my ring back. Mmm-mmm. Why would I do that? Because you don't want me to tell anyone who you really are... Snow White. Help me get my ring back or I turn you over to the Queen's forces. And I have a feeling the Queen's not as charming as I am. Well, I wouldn't want to stand in the way of your getting true love. Ahhh! Thanks for the shirt. Hey, is this your mother's? She'll never notice. Where does she think you are anyway? Playing Whack-A-Mole. And she bought that? She wants to believe it. So she does. Oh, imagine that. She's here! Hey, don't get your hopes up. We're just getting started, okay? - He woke up. - What? I knew it. I mean, he didn't wake up-wake up. But he grabbed my hand. He's remembering. What did the doctor say? That I imagined it. But I'm not crazy, I know it happened. We have to go back. You have to read to him again. Let's go. Wait. Wait... What? If I got through to him, if we made a connection... You don't believe... That he's Prince Charming? Of course not. Somehow, someway, I touched him. You're right! He's waking up. Henry, you should stay back. What's going on? Is it John Doe? Is he okay? He's missing. What the hell are you doing here? And you. I thought you were at the arcade. Now you're lying to me? What happened to John Doe? Did someone take him? We don't know yet. His IVs were ripped out, but there's no sign for sure there was a struggle. What did you do? You think I had something to do with this? It is curious that the Mayor is here. I'm here because I'm his emergency contact. You know him? I found him on the side of the road years ago with no ID. I brought him here. Mayor Mills saved his life. Will he be okay? Okay? The man's been on feeding tubes for years, under constant supervision. He needs to get back here right away or, quite honestly, "Okay" might be a pipe dream. Well then let's quit yappin' and start looking. That's what we're doing. Just stay out of this, dear. And since I clearly can't keep you away from my son, I guess I'm just going to have to keep my son away from you. Enjoy my shirt, because that's all you're getting. Sheriff, find John Doe. You heard Dr. Whale, time is precious. Doctor, how long between your rounds since you last saw him? Twelve hours or so. Then that's what we need to account for. You two were the only employees on the floor last night. And you saw nothing? Not a thing. Did anyone walk by? I didn't see nothing. Miss Blanchard, was there anything unusual you saw during your trip with your class? I don't think so. We're looking at the wrong tape. This is the ward where Henry's class put up decorations. If this was really the tape from last night, we'd see the banners the kids hung. You fell asleep again. You selling me out? I ain't getting fired for this. Least I don't drink on the job! Gentlemen, enough! Where's the real tape? He walked out alone. He's okay. Four hours ago. Where does this door lead? The woods. I thought you weren't the jewelry type. What's that around your neck? Don't worry about it. Careful! It's a weapon. What, dust? What kind of weapon is dust? Fairy dust. I thought that was a good thing. When it comes from a good fairy. This stuff is deadly. It transforms the most fearsome of adversaries into a form that's easily squashed. Then why didn't you use it on me? 'Cause you're not worth it. It's very hard to come by. I'm saving it for a special someone. Ah! The Queen. Got a lot of anger there, don't you, Snow'? The charges on her posters are lies. Didn't stop her from sending her huntsman to rip out my heart. What happened? Well, not everyone is a soulless royal. He took pity on me and let me go. I've been hiding in the forest ever since. Trying to amass enough fortune to leave this place. Escape to another realm. Somewhere isolated. Where I can never be hurt. Sounds lonely. No lonelier than an arranged marriage. At least I don't prey on the innocent. Up until now, I've only ever stolen from the Queen. I thought your carriage was one of hers. No one else uses that road. We took the scenic route. Well, lucky for me. All I'm doing, Charming, is what it takes to survive. She wants me dead. So what did you do to incur that much wrath? She blames me for ruining her life. Did you? Yes. I'm thirsty. May I? Sure. Make it quick. Look who we found. There's nowhere to hide. The Queen wants your heart and we're not going to disappoint her. What is it? The trail runs out here. You sure? 'Cause I thought tracking was one of your skills. Just give me a second. This is my world. I got it. Right. Sorry. What does he mean "his world"? Isn't finding people your thing, too? Sure. Just, people I find usually run to places like Vegas. - Oh! - Not a lot hit the woods. It's an interesting job, finding people. How'd you fall into it? Looking for people's just what I've done for as long as I can remember. What made you start? Your parents? Henry told me that you're... That you were from a similar situation to his own. Did you ever find them? Depends who you ask. Henry! Did you find him yet? No, not yet. You shouldn't be here. I can help. I know where he's going. And where's that? He's looking for you. Hold her still. No! Are you all right? YOU... You saved me. It seemed like the honorable thing to do. Are you ready? For what? MY Jewels. Right. You've got a wedding to get to. The trolls I sold them to are just beyond the next ridge. We need to be careful. What, of trolls? You've clearly never met one. Aren't they just little people? You're thinking of dwarves. Show a little respect. They'll cut your hand off sooner than they'll shake it. Well, then let's get this over with. Yes, we've both got places to be. So let's go. You have your lonely little corner of solitude to find. And you have a ringless fiancée to appease. You're the one who woke him up. You're the last one he saw. He wants to find you! Henry, it's not about me. I just... I think he's lost and confused. He's been in a coma a long time. But he loves you! You need to stop chasing him and let him find you. Kid, you need to go home! Where's your mom? She's going to kill me. And then you. And then me again. She dropped me at the house, then went right out. Well, we need to get you back immediately. - No! - Guys? Is that... Blood. Hyah! Trolls don't like horses. We walk from here. Follow me. And keep quiet. Where are they? They're here. It's fine. I know them. Why you here? I thought we were done? I want to make another trade. I'm not talking in front of him. Who is this guy? No, he's with me. That's good. With you. Well, that makes it all fine. He's no one. Look, I want to buy back the jewels I sold you. Who is he? I said don't worry about it. Look, I'll give you back all of your money. You just give me the ring. You can keep everything else. Thank you. We appreciate the help. He's too eager. This is a setup. - It's not! - He's a Royal! Hold him. Let her go! No! You can trust me. Look, you can trust me. If I wanted to set you up, I would have. Don't hurt him. The time for dealing is done. Search him. Snow White. Quite a reward. Take her! Go! I'm right behind you. Follow me! They don't know the forest like I do. Royal blood is the sweetest of all. You... You saved me. It was the honorable thing to do. What about your special someone? I'll think of something else. Thank you. Anyway. How could I let Prince Charming die? I told you, I have a name. It's James. It's nice to meet you, James. We should go. There may be more of them coming. Oh, God. Where is he? Can you see him? The trail dies at the waterline. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I need an ambulance at the old toll bridge as soon as possible. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. I'm falling, falling, falling. I'm falling. Keep going. Hold on. I feel we need to slow down. Slow down. Slow down. No, no, no, no, no. I found you! It's gonna be okay. Help's coming. Is he okay? Is he gonna be okay? Henry, don't look, okay? Don't look. Come back to us. Come back to me. It's okay. It's okay. You saved me. She did it. She did it. She woke him up. Yeah, kid, she did. Thank you. Who are you? I don't know. It's okay. You're going to be okay. Watch your backs. Coming through. Thanks, guys. We got it from here. David? David, is that you? Excuse me, ma'am. Oh, my God. Ma'am, you can't be in here. Please, you can't be here right now. You can't be here, ma'am. Can you wait over here for a second? Who is that? His wife. So... You probably want this. Right, the gold. Thank you. And you can't get married without this. I know. Not your style. Well, there's only one way to find out. Yeah, not me at all. I'm sure your fiancée will love it. You know, if you need more, you can have the rest. The ring is all I require. No, I'm good. Thanks. We both got what we wanted. Well, wherever you're going, be careful. If you need anything... You'll find me. Always. I almost believe that. Well, goodbye, Snow White. Goodbye, Prince Charming. I told you. It's James. No, still like Charming better. His name is David Nolan. And that's his wife, Kathryn. And the joy on her face? Well, it's put me in quite the forgiving mood. We'll talk about your insubordination later. Do you know what insubordination means? It means you're grounded. Thank you. Thank you for finding my David. Um, I don't understand. You didn't... You didn't know that he was here in a coma? A few years ago, David and I were not getting along. It was my fault. I know that now. I was difficult and unsupportive. I told him if he didn't like things, he could leave. And he did. And I didn't stop him. It was the worst mistake I ever made. You didn't go look for him? I assumed he left town all this time. Now I know why I never heard from him. Now I get to do what I've wanted to do forever. Say I'm sorry. Now we got a second chance. That's wonderful. Well, it's something of a miracle. He's okay? Physically, he's on the mend. His memory is another issue. It may take time, if at all. What brought him back? That's the thing, there's no explanation. Something just clicked in him. He just got up and decided to go for a stroll? He woke up and he was delirious. And his first instinct was to go find something, I guess. Someone. Can I see him? Yeah, of course. Henry, let's go. Wait, my backpack. Don't believe them. You're the one he was looking for. Henry... He was going to the Troll Bridge. It's like the end of the story. Henry, he was going there because it's the last thing I read to him. No, it's because you belong together. Henry. Madam Mayor? Wait by the car. Miss Swan, I let you off the hook back there. Don't press it. I'm sorry, but Mrs. Nolan? Kind of feels like her story could be a load of crap. All this time there's a John Doe lying around in a coma and nobody puts it in the news? Nobody goes looking? Something's not right here. Well, what else would make sense to you? Why would Miss Nolan lie? Oh, do you think I cast a spell on her? I think it's rather strange you've been his emergency contact all these years, and you only found her now. Well, this town is bigger than you know. It's entirely possible to get lost here. It's entirely possible for bad things to happen. Just when it's convenient, you manage to solve the mystery. Thanks to you. That tape you found was a stroke of genius. So we went back and looked at past tapes. Turns out Mr. Doe's been talking in his sleep. He's been calling out for a "Kathryn." After that, it wasn't hard to put the pieces together. And here I thought you and Mary Margaret would be pleased. True love won out. So bask in the moment, dear. Were it not for you two, they would have lived their lives completely alone. That's why I'm willing to forgive your incessant rudeness. Because all this has reminded me of something oh so very important. How grateful I am to have Henry. Because not having someone? Well, that's the worst curse imaginable. Emma. Sorry to bother you so late. Is that spare room still available?
