 What time did we finish writing these? About an hour ago. She didn't want a solicitor in the interview? She was asked, but she said no. It's on tape. It's a proper cough, boss. I want a rape exam. She didn't mention rape. All the more reason. Have the clocks just gone back? You're an hour out with the timing of your notes. Do you want a biscuit? Go on. I used to come here when it was police accommodation.

 My friend lived here. She was called Susan. People aren't called Susan any more, are they? OK. Higher and lower vaginal swabs - some discomfort, nothing to write home about. Dressing gown off, lie on the bed, please. Will it harm my baby? No bruising, no tearing, no abrasions. Oh, so no rape. So we've got a full confession, no sign of any physical or sexual abuse. But there is a baby. Sorry. I didn't mean to... Juliet Miller. I'm charging you with the attempted murder of your husband.

 You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention{, when questioned, } something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Can I clean my teeth? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I saw him yesterday. I want you to do this. I mean{, really do} it. I want Juliet Miller to see the same faces - yours and mine. - I've got something before 12. - Dump it. - What's looking runnable? - Self defence, maybe. - You don't sound hopeful. - She's not talking to me yet. And if he dies? - Then we look at provocation. - Nobody says it, do they? If you're an abused woman and attack an abuser, make sure you kill him - if you don't, it's not murder, we can't run provocation. So is he going to die? It's not mine. The stash belongs to my boyfriend. - I'm sick of him. I'm not having it. - Hello, Angela. Juliet? Anna Klein. Hello. Jack's told me all about you. I'm going to try and get you bail. OK? - Morning, everyone. - Morning, sir. Number three on your list, sir. Angela Spencer. - Is your name Angela Spencer? - Yeah. - Date of birth? - July 16th. - Which year? - Every year. 1985, sir. No objection to bail if there is an address for her to go to. What's the bruising, Miss Spencer? - I walked into a door. - You'll have to speak up. She walked into a door. - 118A Bowman Street? - That's my boyfriend's. - I don't wanna go{ there}. - Why not? Because she walks into doors. - Bail hostel? - There's a bed, but it's in Leeds. Good. I'll bail you to a bail hostel. Seven days? I won't get back here. The hostel will sort out getting you back for court. They'll fuck it up{ or I will}. It always fucks up. Miss Woolf? Will I go inside if I put my hands up to this? - Good. I'll plead. - Angela... The stash is mine. It's a fair cop. Whatever. - Professionally speaking... - My instructions are I wanna go prison, because I need a break and the rehab is better. Can I take a plea now, sir? Just to be clear, Miss Spencer. Your solicitor will tell you, only plead guilty if you are guilty, not for any other reason. You will go to prison for six months. Take her down. Next. Number two on your list, sir. Juliet Miller, charged with attempted murder. Bail position? Repeated attempts to interfere with evidence gathering and when the defendant saw her daughter, her behaviour was unstable. The daughter is a probable prosecution witness, and there's a real fear the defendant will attempt to interfere with her if granted bail. You have to let me see her! Please. Let me see my daughter. Please let me see my daughter. Please let me see my daughter! Yes, Miss Klein? "Extremely unstable." Any thoughts? Your Honour, she saw her 13-year-old daughter at the police station. She didn't know she was there because nobody had told her. She reacted in the way that any mother would react. Yes, she was emotional. What kind of a mother would she be if she weren't emotional under those circumstances? There is no direct evidence she'd try to interfere with a witness. Except that she was arrested in the Critical Care Unit at the hospital in the middle of the night trying to get to her husband and had to be restrained by two police officers. Thank you so much. Bail is refused. No-one told me about the hospital! It's up to the CPS how they do things in court. They weren't at the hospital, were they? You were. We only arrested her 12 hours ago. I don't have time to set up ambushes to scupper bail applications. We know a bit more than you know, that's all. Will you excuse me? Big balls for a Doris. You know how she got silk? If she'd been black, - she'd have got it even younger. - Who's that? It's one of the neighbours. Their daughter's best friends with Ella. They've agreed to look after her until Joe gets better. Call me, we should talk. Only 219 women QCs at the Bar ever, in its entire history. I don't think your positive discrimination theory holds water. Hello, Norma Fredericks? Be with you in a moment. I just need two minutes with Dr Rose. Don't look at me. Here you go. - When does the van go? - After lunch. I need my methadone. The prison will know that. {You're all right.} - Have you called them? - They know your needs{. They know you}, Ange. I'm sorry about bail. - Any questions about anything? - Has he woken up? - Not yet. - What will he say{,do you think,} when he wakes up? You're scared of him.{, aren't you?} I love him. They can just carry on, when he's better, can't they? They? Ella and Joe, when I'm in prison. I mean properly in prison. It's our job to stop that happening. Why? We're a long way from instructions on self defence. It's a process. She doesn't even know she's been abused. Nobody can expect her head to clear at the same speed the system moves at. - What abuse, Jack? - How do you get to be that frightened? Tell me Juliet Miller isn't an abused woman. Come on. Are you a drug user? Are you pregnant? Would you now, have you ever, might you, {in the future }consider killing yourself? Come on. Yes or no? Come on! {Shall }I put yes? Tell me no, if it's not yes. Come on! You're back,{ you} bitch. Pack it in, Lola. Up we get. You're having a hard time, but everyone who comes here is in trouble. You're no different. So long as you understand that, we'll get along fine. Do you have children? No. You? One? A boy? - How old is she? - "I love him!" "I love him because he treats me like shit." "I love him because I'm really{, really} useless and he's really{, really} wonderful." Ask Jack if you love him. - Can I go home? - Why? {Just }To get some of my own clothes? {Is there something}What's wrong with these? I took my father's suits to Oxfam when he died. My mum said, "Do they wear grey in Africa?" A smile costs nothing, young lady. Was it your idea to start taking anti-depressants? I was feeling sad. How's Joe? Joe suggested the anti-depressants? - How do you know{bout this}? - Am I right? I had to stop {	aking them}once I found out that I was pregnant. You didn't tell him that{you'd stopped taking them}? Because you hadn't told him you were pregnant? Will he be angry? So you had to hide the fact that you'd stopped{ taking} the pills? I put them in the rubbish. Why? He would have found out that I wasn't taking them. How would he have found out? - Because he... I don't know... - What? Would he have counted them? He was looking after me. {You see, }I forget things. - What things do you forget? - Turning the bath off, the oven on... Custard. That night. If I hadn't forgotten to get the... What? If you hadn't forgotten to get the custard, then what? Are you helping me? - Yes, we are. - They say the solicitors help. Tell us about the custard. It was on the shopping list. But I didn't get it. I don't remember seeing it on the list. I don't even remember the shopping list. - Maybe there wasn't a list? - There must have been. - Why? - Joe said. Record from the Miller home computer. Take a look at five o'clock precisely on the night of the crime. - Life insurance. Whose? - Joint. The record was cleared 45 seconds later. - She was hiding it. - If it was her. Statement from the black cab driver{who took Joe home}. Look at the time he dropped him off. "Five o'clock exactly".{He can't know that.} How can he know that? - Pips. Radio 4. - What? Cab driver remembers Joe paying and the pips at five at exactly the same time. {Even }Joe Miller can't get out of a cab and {look }at the computer at the same time. {No, }It was her. And she wanted to hide what she was looking{ at}. - Gosh. - She was planning it, Flo. This is not some spontaneous domestic. It's a proper, planned shot at murder. You look like a little boy. All pleased with what you've found. It's called police work, love. What did you used to do? What? Before Joe? Nothing. I needed Joe to survive. What was your sex life like? I wasn't very good at it. He was unhappy about the sex? You won't do what he wants? What does he want? Did he rape you? Let me put it another way. Did you say no to sex? I should have been nicer to him. How's Ella? When can I see her? She doesn't want to come here. Not at the moment. Can we try for bail again? Please? What's the difference between rape and saying no to sex? - The answer from a client. - {You think }I was pushing her too hard? I've never coached a witness in my life. Abused women don't do nods and winks{, Anna}. They have to be helped. It's {just }dishonest not to accept that. Anyway, {she said she was rape}we're up and running with self defence. Taking a knife{rom the kitchen} to bed with you. Reasonable force in proportion to the threat? It's all we've got. You didn't answer her{ question}. How is he? He's improving. The bastard. - You wish he was dead? - As a lawyer? Yes. As a woman? - Ain't that our job? - What? To keep the personal out of the professional. Hello, it's Ella here. I'm out and about {so I can't take your call,} but please leave a message and I will call you back. Norma? It's me. - I don't like it here... - Have you got the phone{ in there}? She knows when to stop. How? When it hurts enough. Excuse me. She's really bleeding. Give me the blade, Ange. Second day{ back}, you're a pain in the arse already. Need some help in here. {All I'm saying is }How is the reputation of social services looking{ in London}, right now? - Norma, listen... - Or, to put another way { and dropping the bullshit, just for a moment} since there's a safe and suitable middle-class family who would be happy{ delighted} to have Ella{ Miller}, - why don't we {just }get{ the hell } on with it? - Why do you do this job? The children {who live in}of this borough need me. Bloody hell. We've known her all her life. {I mean, }Kate and Ella started school together. What's your attitude to what has happened? God! That's a word. Well, to be honest, we just want to help. We want to give Ella a normal, warm place to live. {There is something} You need to accept something. Juliet could pose a risk to Ella. I'm not pre-judging{ the criminal proceedings} but her violence is an established and undisputed fact. What are you saying? We need to be sure you'll keep Ella safe. From her mother? She's in prison. She'll be safe with us. And will she go back to Joe when he's better? Do you have a view about that? I'm happy. Juliet's pregnant. Did you know that? Ella will have to be told. Yes, of course. - You knew she was pregnant? - Yeah. Well, I saw her on the day it all happened. As a patient? Have you told the police? Why not? Well, I don't want to... contradict what she's saying. Don't you think it's important? I mean... Her mental state... They get the patient records anyway. There are no records. Why not? Because I didn't see her at the surgery. - Where did you see her? - Here. Jesus Christ, Dom. Why here? She hates going out. { I mean, }It's really hard for her to be in the public. She's a friend. - You were being kind to her. - Yes We're watching you, Ange. - Why do you do it? - For the pain. Did you do it at home? I get battered at home. I don't need to be cutting. Why does he...? - He's jealous. - What is he jealous of? What isn't he jealous of? We had a broken drain in our street once and the sewage flooded our flat. He was down the pub and when he got back he beat the shit out of me because he said I was looking at the plumber. Turds floating about in our kitchen, and all he's interested in is me looking at the plumber. Why don't you leave him? Why didn't you leave your husband? That's... different. So why did you stab him? It's a lock. They've got nowhere to go. Self defence doesn't play with checking out how much money you'll get. I'll take a statement from the daughter. Imagine what she's feeling. - You off home, boss? - Yeah. - Why are you...? - What? A DI taking a witness statement? Well, she's 13 years old. I don't want some baby PC doing it. Take Flo. She went downstairs. 30 seconds. She takes three knives from the kitchen. Another 60 seconds. She went back upstairs. 30 seconds more. That's two minutes. And what does she do? She had a nice sit down. In the interview she said for "quite a long time." What's that? Five minutes? More? We're up to a minimum of ten minutes now. This isn't spontaneous, is it? This is a cold-blooded bitch. Why are you so angry about this one? That poor girl was in there, Flo. She pulled a knife out of her dad. Why wouldn't I be angry? Mum says you can sleep in here with me. What shall we do? Should we just talk? OK. You're awake. What did your husband do to you? Nothing. Yeah but, what, though? What does Jack say he did to you? He raped me. And he didn't? They asked me. And you said yes. I didn't say no. You're here about your medication? A Dr Rose contacted us. These are different to what you were on before, but they're fine to take with the pregnancy. Do you want some water? Well, let me see you take them. Open. Good girl. Off you go. Were her anti-depressants prescribed by you? Yes. What was the nature of her depression? Sorry. I'm her doctor. Why don't you talk to me as her friend? Three years ago, she was stuck in a traffic jam and she needed to be home. So she got out of the car and ran. Door open. Engine running. Traffic blocked. - Why? - Good question. - She felt under pressure. - From what? I've probably said enough. Joe said something in hospital before losing consciousness. {He said }Your name. Why would he do that? I don't know. What kind of a witness do you think he'll be? He's a barrister. He knows how to do that stuff. Yes. She's raw, she's angry, she hates her mum. She's a brilliant witness. And all that softened by some therapy nonsense. What a dump. A multi-agency approach is... This agency says to your agency, "Stop this bollocks." Don't let anyone speak to my witness who wants to change the way she thinks. We think she has PTSD. - You think everyone has PTSD. - What do you suggest? We leave her wrecked until the trial is over? How much damage would that do to her? We should ask the lawyer. Josh, can I have a word? Therapy to treat PTSD in a 13-year-old girl whose mother is alleged to have stabbed her father. Now or after the trial? There's case law. Therapy now. - Anything else? - Why don't you ask yourselves how that poor girl is going to feel if Mum gets acquitted? What kind of therapy do you give her then? You knew, didn't you? The case law? What you've forgotten is that lawyers only give us advice. I get to decide. Get on with it. My job is to help you. I'm going to talk to you about dealing with what has happened. My mum tried to kill my dad. What's there to talk about? - Do you talk to anyone about it? - My best friend. - What's your friend's name? - Kate. What do you say to Kate about what happened? - Is it the same thing you said to me? - No. Good. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1's the lowest and 10's the highest... where would you put the pain you feel about what's happened? 12. I'm going to get that score right down. - I promise you. - My dad will do that. Why are we looking at Joe's life when we've got her sewn up? What are they going to run? "I was in such immediate fear "of serious injury or death, "that I had to check the life insurance, ponder my options for about five hours "and then, completely in proportion with the very immediate threat "that I was facing from my probably asleep husband, "I stuck the biggest knife I could find in him up to the hilt." - She was depressed. - So she'll make a crap witness. Too narrow. You've focused in too tight, too soon. - Context is everything. - What context? Joe Miller had Â£600 {*in Â£20 notes }in his{ trouser} pocket the night he was stabbed. One has some very interesting prints on it. - Whose? - Crack dealer. Could have gone through {dozens }lot of hands before Joe got it. Then you look at the Drug Squad surveillance log. Why do you always want me to be your number two? Every straight man needs a fool. Keeping watch? My boys are my family. Â£600 in his trouser pocket. - What was he doing with that {kind of }cash? - I gave it to him. He was running the London Marathon. I sponsored him. He kept a note of his sponsors in his brown book. It's not there. Between you and me, I'm not too keen of a record of my financial life being kept. Joe knows that. You're happy to say that in court? I've told you, ain't I? Is it a fixture? Good. Yes, he'll be available. Armed robbery at the Bailey in July. Joe's comeback case. Excuse me. What do you want? My boss is interested in context. And you're not? Did I say that? Have you spoken to Ella? Not yet. I'm her godfather. Look after her for us. Always. - Where are you going? - Styal. - What? - It's another prison. - Why? - I dunno. They don't give you a reason. It's just what they do. Mum. ... she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness... Dad? When Miss Bingley's letter arrived, it put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends{* in Hertfordshire} before he left the country. Hope was over, entirely over, - and when Jane could attend to... - Dad? Ella, wake up. Bingo. Jane Grady. She said you said Joe didn't rape you, that you made it up to keep us happy. Yes, you said it? Or yes, it's true? Her words are confirmed by the {physical }evidence, or lack of it. There is no sign of rape. We're in trouble. We can get at her - she's got form for dishonesty and what she's getting in return is an interesting question, but you've got to be straight with us. We really, badly want to help you. We can't do it unless you start talking to us. Sorry. I don't think you're being dishonest. I just think you're scared. There's something you're not telling us. He can't get to you any more. There is something, isn't there? I'm saying this because I want what's best. That's all I care about. Shutting things away never helps. She's your mum. I think you need to see her. Can be as short a visit{ as you like}. This is not about her. This is for you, Ella. Six o'clock slap. What? I used to do my make-up at six. - Why? - For when he got home. It upset him to see the damage he'd done to me, so I covered it up for him. You look great. You go and see your daughter. - Was it Jane? - What? That's what they do with grasses. Move them to keep them safe. No. It wasn't Jane. Want this visit or what? I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Please look at me. Ella, please. Why, Mum? Dad was just trying to look after you. My lovely girl. I did it for you. Jack? When? When can I call you? What do you think? Do you think I'll get bail? What do you say about the confession in interview? Don't look so surprised. Contrary to your {like to }belief, some judges do read the papers before a hearing. We'll argue the interview's inadmissible because there was no solicitor present. You mean she sounds cold-blooded and you'd rather the jury didn't hear it? - She was suffering from shock. - Look forward to hearing your argument. Bail. You're the trial judge? - Has Miller appeared in front of you? - Of course. Many times. And I'm being very careful to exclude all personal considerations from my professional deliberations. When do we all get your defence statement? Working on it. Fascinating to see what the defence will be. Mr Holloway? Bail. It's the Crown's view there's a{ real} fear of the defendant failing to attend her trial if granted bail. The evidence is strong and getting stronger, she's unstable, she's depressed, she's pregnant, she has nowhere to live. Your Honour. All good reasons for granting her bail. Where is a depressed, pregnant woman going to disappear to? - She doesn't have the wherewithal. - Where would she go? There's a place in a hostel for battered women. What evidence is there of that? My solicitor spoke to the hostel this morning... Of her being a battered woman. An eloquent silence, Miss Klein. I'm not going to grant this bail application. Of course, my ruling on bail doesn't mean that I don't have an open mind on every issue when this comes to trial. Well, thank you, Your Honour. If I can keep the personal out of court, so can you. - How are the children, Mr Holloway? - Fine, thank you, Your Honour. I was his pupil. - Coffee? - Fuck off. Bail has been refused. I'm really sorry. I've got to go. I wish I was pregnant. Why? I like babies. You got children? Gone now. - Where? - Just gone. I was young. Do you want me to keep talking to you? Yes, please. What names are you thinking of? I don't know. What names do you like? I like Daniel for a boy. And Sarah for a girl. Do you reckon it will be a boy? I think so. Are you all right? "If you ask for a promotion this week, "you could get a positive answer." Grass. What? Help! The sugar in the water means it sticks to the skin. Won't cool down. The pain goes on and on. Who did this? BP is falling. Are we all right? - Heart rate's up at 130. - 250 mils of Voluven. Lungs OK. Slow down. He's not going anywhere. Ready? What is it? It's your husband. I'm afraid he's dead. Thanks. I can't... Please, no... It's a murder now. {pos(192,230)}You go into that courtroom and you let that jury know {pos(192,230)}that you are your father's daughter. {pos(192,230)}Push! I'm finding you a place on a mother and baby unit. You go in front of a board to decide if you are suitable. If you are so convinced that Juliet Miller is a murderer, - why are you against me looking at Joe? - He's not in charge any more. - You are. - You can tell us about your dad. - How much you miss him. - {*I don't think }I can't go on without my baby.
