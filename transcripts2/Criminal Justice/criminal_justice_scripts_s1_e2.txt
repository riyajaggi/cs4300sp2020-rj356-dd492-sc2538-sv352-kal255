 0632. Next. My best friend. John Richie. - He's... - Just the number, not his life story. Step over the line. I can't remember. - Do you want to go on the numbers? - What does that mean? Vulnerable Persons Unit. Am I vulnerable? You raped and killed a 20-year-old girl. That makes you a nonce. - You can go on the VPU and be safe. - But I'm not that. I didn't do it. Everybody did it. Nobody will stop wanting to kill you because you say you're innocent.

 Decision, please. Now. - I don't want to go there. - Fine. Welcome back, Mr Milroy. Over there. Face me. Head back. Clear. Stay. Mouth wide open. Clear. Now, lift up your nuts. On your knees, Flitcroft. Check for me. - Clear. - He's winking at you. You're in there, Flitcroft. Roll back your foreskin for me. Or do you want Flitcroft to do it for you? Down you go, Flitcroft. Clear. Right, squat for me. - What? - Feet two feet apart, arse nine inches from the ground. Go. Lower. Hold it there. Keep it there. Clear. Put your clothes back on, come out when you're dressed. Are you on any medication? Ventolin. My friend's phone number. I couldn't remember it. Can I go back and tell him, please? Or could I give it to you maybe and you could tell him? - Don't you touch me, man! - You hold your position, hold it! There's a mobile phone up his bottom! I can see it hanging out. Don't touch him. You can ask him if he wants to give it to you. If you lay a finger on him, it constitutes an assault. You may be good at sticking a gun in people's nostrils, but I bet you can't keep your sphincter shut for 30 seconds in a low squat. 29, 28, 27... You're not gonna make it! - What are you writing? - It's my job to assess what level of risk you are to others and to yourself. What did you put? If I tell you your risk level, that might change your risk level. You're making me paranoid. Do you have feelings of paranoia? - No. - What risk level do you think you are? Um... I'm fine. Give me the phone number. I'll see to it for you. Three, two... - Come on! - ... one, zero! - Solitary, right? Till it comes out. - Solitary? What solitary? The singles have got three men in 'em. Solitary's a luxury we can't afford. I'm going to check what cell you're in. Just follow the yellow brick road. Take him onto the wing, John. I'll go and check the allocations. Wait here. This one's an H. - First time in. - What do you want me to do? We don't have any singles, Bill. He needs to be in with a grown-up - somebody who won't have him for breakfast. - That leaves Hooch or Neary then. Hooch it is, then. It's all right. He thinks he's a dog. Why? Because he used to be one. Childhood trauma. His dad kept him in a dog kennel for five years with three bull mastiffs. He learned to be a dog. What's he doing in here? - Don't ask. - Why is he not in a... What? Dogs home? Psychiatric unit? Broadmoor won't have him. Why not? They don't want a dog. What? Nothing. It's feather weight. What are you in for? Came in with me. He's all right. You tell anyone who asks, you robbed a post office in Wales, somewhere rural. And a way down the road, it went wrong. Why are you helping me? It was only cigarettes. You didn't know what you were saying. I don't do grudges here. Thanks. What did he want? - Who? - Milroy. You know him? - What did he want? - Nothing. It means I listen, all right? Anyone who wants to talk to me, they can say what they like in complete confidence. I clean the chapel. Same time every day. Do a lot of listening in the chapel. What are you in for? I cut a man's arm off with a meat cleaver. You? I robbed a post office in South Wales. On your own? Yeah. Somewhere rural? Did you have a big bad gun with you? It's lLucky for you I'm the first con to hear that particular piece of fiction. If it was true, every time a new nonce on the wing said they robbed a post office in rural Wales, they'd be making Clint Eastwood films in Swansea, wouldn't they? He set you up, your friend Milroy. I'm not a nonce. He brought a phone in. You sure? He lives here. People want to take a long hard look at a new man before they go anywhere near him. So just let them look. Don't talk, just yet. Is there anything else? Yeah... Milroy... he won't go away. What should I do? Whack him. Lock up. Shut up! Wakey wakey, boys and girls. Rise and shine. Lovely day. Sir, the Ben Coulter case. I just wanted you to check my statement over, for anything I might have left out. How did you get here from the canteen? Did you consume your hot beverage at 0830 hours before proceeding in a northerly direction towards your destination? Or did you just walk? Do it again. In English. Not police speak. I was wondering, sir. About the vomiting, really. - Hop in. - Done your report? I'm going out. On the street. Where crime is. Where are we going, sir? The Storkhill estate. - Morning! - Morning, sir. See that. Are they detectives? No. Are they doing door to doors? Somebody died right there. Maybe a lowlife drug dealer, but still a human being. And what are we spending police time doing? Protecting the scene of death from vandals. Protecting society from its inability to behave decently. Take anyone of these. What? Take any one of these, put them in the dock and a jury pots them. Why? Because their eyes have no more expression in them than dead haddock. Ben Coulter, he's not like these. Ben Coulter doesn't look like a murderer. He looks like a human being. Sir? The jury will look at him and they're going to wonder... Could he really... stick a big knife into that young girl? We will have to fight that. Sir. What's this got to do with me being sick? - What's your first name? - Simon. Constable Simon Jeary, brand new copper, walks onto a crime scene and walks out again throwing up. And why shouldn't he? He's a very new policeman who's just seen his first dead body. Ben Coulter may well be a human being but so was Melanie Lloyd and so is Constable Jeary. So, put the throwing up in your statement. You're a Mormon? What? No, I'm... He's a Mormon. Why did you say that? 'Cause Mormons get hot chocolate instead of tea. Prison tea's disgusting. Hot chocolate's much better. You're a Mormon. Dispensary. Nurse wants to see you. Come on! You should have two inhalers. Here's a spare. Thank you. I don't know your name. Nurse. The guy before me... - Someone took his... - We hand out what we're supposed to, the rest is whatever it is. But it looked like he really needed it. And we gave it to him. Yes, featherweight. Come. There you go. What you asked for. How are your children? Good. And your lovely lady? She's fine. I am enhanced. Do you know what that is? I am polite. I am... clean. I enquire after the well-being of prison officers and their families. I always remember the names of their children. I ask about their children. And they go shopping for me. So, who runs this place? The screws? You know, some people still believe ugly white men with broken noses are the bosses. All those tiresome Essex blaggers, with... big bellies and big Tonka toys to drive around in. Are they in charge? Freddie's the boss. Freddie Graham. Right. One of those Tonka boys wants to hurt you. I can stop that if you want. Close your eyes. What is it? What did the kind, thoughtful prison officer bring us? Veal? You know, from the time they're born, they're kept in a dark crate so small they can't turn around, and fed only on milk. Half blind, in the dark, waiting to die. Do you want Freddie Graham to help you? Or do you prefer dead in the shower with your guts cut out and your smart brains all over the floor? 15. Five cheaper than Freddie Graham. What did he say? He offered me protection. And you're not going to accept. Let me tell you something, sunbeam. The stupid and the weak... they don't survive in here. The stupid and the violent... they don't survive, either. They might swim a bit longer but they go down in the end. The strong and the brave... they sink like stones. So who survives? Only one kind. The deal maker. The man who makes a contract. He survives. I saw Milroy renting out his mobile phone. Freddie's not going to like that. What's the deal? I mean, with the... - mobile phone thing? - Well, the regular hard line phone is listened to. Every call by every con is recorded. So nobody can talk the way they want to talk, so a mobile phone becomes a very valuable commodity. 90% of the people in here have got a SIM card hidden somewhere. So you rent the phone for the night and use your own SIM card. Simple. So, Milroy having a phone - and renting it out... - That, my beamish boy, is a declaration of war. - The Crown versus Ben Coulter. - Looking forward to it. - Manslaughter. - What? You want me to offer a plea to manslaughter? He killed her, but he lacked the intent to do serious harm. - The CPS are confident on murder. - That's why I'm here. The CPS will say no to me every time. But they always say yes to the man in the wig. What's happening here, Rogers? The evidence is really strong, there are no witness problems. - What are you scared of? - Coulter's got no form for anything, he looks innocent. - Your point being? - A jury will like him. Hold on. Are you actually suggesting that with all my colossal talent, I might not get him potted? If it's a fight and he walks, it's a public relations catastrophe. "White boy rapes and kills black girl and gets off scot free." You want me to carve it. Black or white, Paul? Come on, Paulie, black or white? - Black. - What's the matter? Afraid to make the first move? E4. A5. What sort of a reply is that? The move is E5. Or maybe C5, depending if you're a Royal Lopez man or a... Sicilian. I like the Sicilian. Gives you a certain dominance on the Queen's side and a... little bit of interesting asymmetry across the board. Ben, help him out. - But you haven't got a board and pieces. - What, you've never played head chess? I'll give you a break since it's your first time. Look at the window. See? Eight squares across, four squares up and down. That's half a chess board. Look at the window, double it, - imagine the pieces, play the game. - I don't know about... the way of saying the move. A to H across, 1 to 8 up and down the board. Your move. D... 5. The Scandinavian! Very punchy. He's in this cell because they want you to look after him, isn't he? - Are you looking after me, too? - Just play the game, Ben. Just play the game. Has he said anything to you? - How is he? - How is he? I'm sure he's fine. Right... We've got the committal bundle. The prosecution witness statements. I want to have a good look and then consult with our barrister. - Right, Thank you. - Then we can have another chat. He's very good. He didn't say anything. He's holding off until he's read everything and he knows exactly what to do. - That's because he thinks Ben did it. - Don't be silly, he doesn't. Why were you looking in Ben's drawers? - So it's OK? - Yeah. I mean... Probably boring, but it's OK? Listen, mate. We have got the best criminal justice system in the world and the jury will get it right. They'll see you and they'll see past the evidence. They'll just see you. Sorry, people. Time's up. And the lawyers that , I've got you, - don't worry about, they're the best. - You can't afford them. My son is charged with a murder that he didn't do. What kind of a dad would I be if I didn't stump up for that? What other kind of rainy day is there? Wind it up now, gents. You be strong, all right? You stay strong. You're not staying in here. - What do you want? - Roland... I don't want your protection. I'm OK. Thank you. How disgusting is that? Get them cleaned up. Hush, little boy. Not a word. You can keep the methadone. The pigeons have landed. You think I'd forget, eh? "You took my cigarettes!" I never forget. Everyone should know when there's a grass about. Lunchtime. Milroy'll come at you again. You need help if you're going to survive in here, Ben. You need Freddie Graham's protection. It's only a contract. You're not selling your soul. Goto him. Then you'll be safe. I'm not staying in prison. Right. What have we got? My name is Ben Coulter. I'm 21 years old, charged with rape and murder. The victim's blood is all over me, my blood is all over her, my semen is found inside her. I'm all over the bedroom where the body is found, which is groaning with the tonnage of violent struggle evidence. The knife used to kill her is found in my pocket, a neighbour identifies me running from the scene, and I contradict myself all over the place in the interview. So, unless you've got Perry Mason lined up as my junior, we're completly down the plughole on this one, aren't we, Hugo? We're here for Ben Coulter. I believe in you, and I'm a fighter. Always have been, always will be. I've built my reputation on fighting. I mean, Hugo here sends me work because he knows I'll fight my corner every time. But I need something to fight with. No, Ben. Please don't speak. What you say to me might prove unhelpful to our relationship. It's very important that I only hear from you the things I want to hear, nothing else. Nothing embarrassing. - You should know... - No, no. I don't think you're the best judge of what I should or shouldn't know. I need you to say the things which help me do my job. OK? I'm not going to put you on the spot now. That would be unfair. I want you to come to the plea and case management hearing, tomorrow morning, with some instructions for me. "I killed Melanie Lloyd but my mind was seriously impaired when it happened." I'd be delighted if that's what you were to tell me. OK? Good. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. You've got till half past. What's happened? I'm fine. We mustn't lie to each other, Ben. How's Dad? Where is he? He doesn't know I'm here. I liked her, Mum. I felt... different. She made me feel different. We went to bed. It was... odd. I can't fill in the blanks. I woke up downstairs. I didn't kill her. I mean, even if you didn't remember, you'd know, wouldn't you? You... you'd feel it. I don't feel like a murderer. I just don't. I thought I knew all there was to know about you. My boy. My lovely boy. Rise and shine! Lovely day! You know, you don't need to be here. This is a pre-trial case management thing. I'm looking after her. I know. And when it comes to the trial, I will be with you every step of the way. Good morning, Counsel. Everything in order? No witness problems? - Might not need any witnesses. - What? There's no better evidence of guilt than a plea of guilty. - Nobody pleads to murder. - You're right. So we have to make an offer. In the interests of justice. What are you talking about? You can't do that. I have to see the bigger picture. This is Rogers, isn't it? What's the matter with you people? How's it looking your side? Manslaughter. - Is that an offer? - Yes. - Cleared with the CPS? - Yep. Old Bill? Won't be a problem. The prosecution will accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter. If you plead guilty to manslaughter, they'll drop the murder. Hang on... Ben, get this crystal clear in your head. You plead guilty to manslaughter, you'll be sentenced for that and there will be no murder trial. How long? A fraction of the mandatory life sentence if you go down on the murder. But how long is that? Five years. Wich in real terms means two-and-a-half to serve. It's a brilliant deal. A contract. Your plea of guilty in exchange for a short sentence. We need an answer. Sorry. Late. Hello. - We're on in five minutes, Ben. - I'd be saying I killed her. You're being offered this because it's obvious you killed her. But how can I say that? I don't remember. I think you do. See you upstairs. - Frances Kapoor, I'm tthe junior barrister. - He said... five years if I plead guilty to manslaughter, is that right the sentence? - Sounds right. - It's all so fast. Can I have more time to think? Can you... If you plead guilty this morning, you'll get maximum credit from the judge for an early plea and that keeps the sentence low. It shouldn't be like this. It's money, really. They pretend it isn't. But it is. A trial costs a lot more than a guilty plea. Thank you. - For what? - Talking to me normally... honestly. What would you do? If I were you, I'd ask myself one question. Did I kill her? If the answer's yes, take the deal. If the answer's no... don't. I've come to say good luck before I'm needed in Court 3. They're offering manslaughter. They say 5 years. - Take it. - I can't stay in that place. Take it. Two-and-a-half years is nothing, - 15 and you're dead. - Two-and-a-half years in there. I can't do it. If I was your lawyer, I'd have you up against the wall screaming in your face to take this deal. You're not my lawyer. So tell me what you'd do as a human being. All rise, please. Ben Coulter, stand up, please. On count one, you are charged with murder. The particulars of the offence are that on Sunday, the 25th of November 2007, you did murder Melanie Lloyd. Do you plead guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. On count two, you are charged with manslaughter. The particulars of the offence are that on Sunday, the 25th of November 2007, you unlawfully killed Melanie Lloyd. To that charge do you plead guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. I told you I'd do it. I know you did. I'll do it again as well. You don't want to kill yourself, Alan. I know you. You stay alive for me. All right? I'll do it. You just take care. 80% of the people in here are mentally ill. Prison is the place where we lock up lunatics and treat them like animals, so when they get out, we get a load of lunatic animals. Anybody tells you any different, they're either full of it or a politician. Or both. - Aren't you going to ask me what happened? - I already know. The whole wing knows about Ben Coulter, rapist, murderer. I didn't do this. Sure. Do you believe me? What I think is unimportant. No-one on the wing believes you. As far as they're concerned, you're a nonce. I need help. And you tell him you're sorry, alright? You're sorry because he's one of ours now. He's one of our lads now. That's your lot. All right? I... I wanted to say sorry. Come. "Quid pro quo", do you know what that means? Yeah. Here's the quid for my quo. Come on, you little brat. Joe here's crossed me. I don't like being crossed. But I believe in forgiveness. My good friend Roland here is going to talk to you about joe and his mother and atonement for his sins. If I were you, I'd listen very carefully. His mother puts a drug wrap in her vagina. It's all perfumed up when it goes inside so the dogs don't sniff it out. During the visit, she takes it out of her pom-pom and puts it in a bag of sweets. That's where you come in. What? Not even a sinner like joe can be expected to swallow a wrap out of his own mam. Now you do this right, Joe's paid his debt. Don't do it right and... Boy, I don't even know what will happen to him. Or you. But trust me, Freddie Graham does not fuck about with second chances. You have to practise with them. Head back, open your throat, keep it open, swallow. You have to do this. Knight to F3. Knight... to C6. Good, you're shaping up. It's none of my business. If I was you, and I was in your situation, I wouldn't want two men in pinstripes looking after me. The trouble with posh is it don't dig for dirt. Are you all right? Yes. Ben, I should be working this case. I've got a smell for it and I've got a smell for you. And I do not want to see you go down. Some cases need dogs with low bellies and good noses. That's me. All right. Yes? Yes. You've got it. I'll call my dad. Tongue up. On you go. Arms up. Let's see in your mouth. Tongue up. On you go. Arms up. Let's see there. Mouth open. Open your mouth! Shopping, From Mr Graham. There's one thing Freddie Graham's terrified of. Boredom. You're that rare thing, a lad in prison with half a brain. He can't resist you. The first day of a trial is always stressful. - We're running self-defence. - But that's not... No "buts". It's the only defence available to us. We need instructions. We can't just make it up. He likes you. Help him to remember what we want him to remember. You told me not to admit to anything I couldn't remember doing. All we have to do is raise the possibility of self-defence in court. One nod from you and the prosecution has to work very hard to disprove - you weren't defending yourself. - She came at you. What else could you do? You had to do it. Or die.
