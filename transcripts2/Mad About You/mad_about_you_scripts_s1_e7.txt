 Still can't believe it. My age, has a heart attack. - And the right age would be? - Yeah, I know. But, still, you know, you don't picture people your own age dying. Will you zip me? And he supposedly took great care of himself, Gonzo. Well, according to Ira, anyway. And "Gonzo", why? Uh, "Ganzenmuller". Eddie Ganzenmuller. So, "Gonzo". He was really more Ira's pal than mine. but I'll tell you, the two of them...

 Does this dress make my back skin look squished? I... I don't see it, no. - Eh. - It's just so scary. All right, I'm putting a sweater over it. What? No. No, I'm saying all the funerals. How many funerals we're going to. Suddenly, everybody we know is dying or falling or hurting themselves... and doing nothing. Remember that guy downstairs? Broke his wrist opening cereal? He was much older than us. Ow! - What'd you do? - My neck. - What? - I was trying to close my pants.

 I strained a little too hard. I popped a thing in my neck. Ow. You hurt your neck putting on pants? Yes. No, that's all right. You know, uh, usually you don't see a marimba in a eulogy, but I... I felt it added. Paulie, I'm telling you, something is not right. I don't trust him. - Oh, my God. - What? No, no, knowing Gonzo, I bet he's not even dead. - This may all just be a set-up. - What? - Asshole... - No, listen to me. There's no way Gonzo dies without sticking me with that card. - Help a girl out. - She... tell her. Okay. When me and Gonzo were little kids... Twenty-five, but go ahead with the story. Okay. We used to trade baseball cards. Then, one... one day we came across a card of a guy... Actual name: Dick Pole. Already so delightful. I'm not even making it up. Last name: "Pole". First name: "Dick". He didn't think to go with "Richard" or "Rich"? "Richie"? - "Ricky"? - I... I know. You would think, right? And we just thought it was the funniest thing in the world. Dick Pole. I mean, what can I say? We were kids. Yeah, yeah. Again, 25, but you... So anyway, we... we somehow made up this silly game where, you know, we'd... Paulie, what are you looking at? - Huh? - No, I pulled a thing in my neck. Putting on pants. So anyway, we had this dopey game where the person who got stuck holding the card was "it". He was Dick Pole. So in order to not be Dick Pole, we had to go back and forth and try and come up with ways to trick the other guy into taking the card. For instance, three weeks ago, I baked it into a calzone, sent it to the guy's house, and he never saw it coming. - Dick Pole. - Yeah, he's a real guy. - You can... you can look him up. - I'm going to. Yeah. And, oh, by the way, even though Gonzo is "supposedly" dead, I'm telling you, that dirty bastard... - Ira. - Louise. Mm. Hey, do you remember my cousin Paulie? Of course. Thank you for coming. Of course. This is my wife, Jamie. Hi, I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. Did you get to know my husband? I didn't, but I've heard so much about him. Such a wonderful man. Rock solid. You know, bless his heart, he left everything in order... all our affairs... which is such a blessing for me and the children. Such a mensch. Well, thank you all for coming. - Of course. - Yeah, of course. Yeah. Okay, she's very sweet, but I'm telling you, someone is gonna drop that card on me here tonight. - Watch. - Did you hear what she said? He had all his affairs in order. We... we don't have any affairs in order. Okay, here it is. "Dick Pole". I told you. We're not rock solid at all. - Oh, my. - What? Okay, there are so many better names than Dick Pole. - You're gonna kick yourselves. - What are you looking at? "Top 20 Baseball Players With Funny Names". You ready? Stubby Clapp... - Cannonball Titcomb... - Wow. - Jack Glasscock... - All right, you know what? - Johnny Dickshot... - No, are you serious? What, am I making this up? Pete LaCock. Okay, sweetie. - Oh... oh, this is unfortunate. - What? I mean, he spells it with a "K", but still. - What? - You ready? I don't know, just... what? Rusty Kuntz, okay? - What? - Sweetie... Aren't you embarrassed you went with Dick Pole and left Rusty Kuntz on the table? Sweetie, you know what? We... that's enough. - We got it. - Tony Suck. Also, sweetie... you know what, my darling? - Pussy Tabeau. - Okay, all right. We... so sorry. If you were looking for dead passports or the seating chart for our wedding rehearsal dinner, found them. We don't even have a copy of our own will. Did we ever even do one? Yes, yes, right before Mabel was born. Remember that lawyer we found? I don't even have the guy's name. - Okay, this is interesting. - What? All right, remember that life insurance policy we took out 20 years ago? - Yeah. - It was a 20-year policy. Expires Tuesday. Seriously? Wow. Yeah, so if you're thinking of pushing me in front of a bus, try and do it by Monday. - Gurwitz. - Gesundheit. No, Marty Gurwitz was the attorney who did our will. - Yes, very good. - This is from Mabel. "How are you enjoying Rishi?" I don't know what that means. Does she mean "sushi"? "How are you enjoying sushi?" In general? How are we enjoying sushi in general? What is she talking about? "Daddy is wondering, do you mean in general or"... Oh, hi! I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Mabel said you were both out. I'm Rishi. "Is Rishi, by any chance, a person you let into our house?" Just one second. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I could have sworn I asked you if he could stay here. Yeah, no, you didn't. Well, I think he's a very nice young man. Isn't he great? Yeah, he's in my "Gender and Urbanization" seminar. So smart. Yeah, well, he fixed our printer, so I gotta second that "smart" comment. And you two are... - No, we're just friends. - Oh, all right. And... just curious... he's staying here because... ? Oh, yeah. He was suspended. Uh, suspended for what, if I may ask? For coming to class naked as a political statement. Ah. What was it exactly he was stating? Well, it was in support of a girl who was suspended last week just for being topless on campus. Can you believe that? That's so unfair. So unfair. Really? What... what's unfair? The whole... the entire... The subjugation of women. - The subjugation. - Okay. - The systemic bias... - Hello. The way women have been marginalized... I have for sure been marginalized. The patriarchal... Don't get me started on the patriarchy. If I hear one more straight white man blabbing on... You're blabbing on pretty good yourself, I gotta say. Hello. - Oh, hey. - I took the dog for a walk. I hope that's okay. Also, I noticed he had a raw spot on his paw. I put some aloe vera ointment on it and he seems much happier. - That's, uh, thoughtful. - Thank you. Hey, by the way, I can probably fix your neck. - My dad's a chiropractor. - Oh, no, that's okay. You know what? Actually, sweetie, we gotta get going too. Yeah, where are you guys going all dressed so fancy? - We're meeting with a lawyer. - You guys getting divorced? No, we're not getting divorced. We're actually... we're getting our affairs in order. You know why? So that when we're dead, you won't have to worry about anything. Oh, okay, cool. We should probably get going too. Where are you two off to? - Nowhere. - We're organizing a protest. Yeah, you are. A protest? Hey, you're the ones who taught me to be socially conscious and politically active. - That was her. - What are you protesting? Well, we've organized a group of students to march through the dining hall naked to show... Whoa, whoa, I think we know what you're gonna be showing, but, uh... excuse me a sec. Sweetheart, do you really think that's a wise choice? I mean, think about it: someday in the future, you're gonna want to go for a job interview, and you don't... I don't think you want the first thing they see to be pictures of you naked next to salad. It's not about being naked. It's about gender inequality and sexualization of the human body. Yes. Do you know some schools are clothing-optional? Yes, you should absolutely have the option to wear whatever you want to wear. No, Mom. Uh, clothing-optional. Like, you don't have to wear clothes at all. Oh, oh. Oh, yes. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, okay. I've heard of that, but I insist that that can't be true. It is. Okay, everything else aside, it's just so unhygienic. No, it's not, because women's bodies produce healthy bacteria... - Okay, I don't... - It's true. Did you know that the vagina is a self-cleaning organ? Terrific, maybe you can have it go clean your room. Honey, I think you're a grown woman, and you should do whatever you choose to do. Exactly, thank you. Bye, I love you! - Bye. - Hey. Hey. My friend, Rishi. - Hi, how are you? - So nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. - Boyfriend? - Nope, they're not having sex. They just march together naked for political purposes. So what's all this? Okay, so what we have here are gifts bequeathed to us from Gonzo. They came to the restaurant this morning. - That's so sweet. - Paulie, it's a trick. I guarantee you, Dick Pole is in one of these. Splinky, I swear, you... Okay, you open it. - Fine, which one is mine? - Here. You know what? You're a bit of a nut. - I'm not. - Yeah. - What... - Okay, look at that. Why would he leave you a watch? I have no idea. Oh, I know. Oh, my... years ago, we were all at this thing and he was wearing... I remember, I commented. I said, "Hey, that's a nice watch". And he said, like, as a joke, "Thanks, I'll leave it to you when I die". So not so much a joke. Well, this is not a watch. Yeah, all right, open it up. - No, I... - Oh, you big baby. - You want me to do it? - No, no, no, no. I'll do it. You're so silly. A penguin? Why would he leave me a penguin? Did you ever tell him you liked his penguin? I'm asking. I don't know. - There's no card. - Well, we know it's from him. No, no, there's no Dick Pole card. Oh. Wait, so why would he leave you a penguin? I just said I don't know! Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Buchman. My name is Yung Hee. I'll be working with you today. - Hang on, where's Marty? - Marty Gurwitz? - Yeah. - Oh, he retired a long, long time ago. Really? He... he was younger than me. Okay. So your estate, such as it is... it seems much of what we have here is extremely outdated. - You know what, we've been busy and... - Raising a teenage daughter. No, the truth is, we're just... we're very bad at this kind of stuff. Well, hopefully many of these issues won't be pertinent for years and years to come, but... But we should fill them out before we die. That would be helpful. For example, I see nothing specified as to your medical directives, your DNRs. - What? - "Do not resuscitate". - Oh. - Should one of you be medically incapable of... I know what I want. Do not resuscitate me. - Thank you very much. - Really? Yeah, I don't wanna stick around and be a burden to you and Mabel. - Would you? - What, be a burden? Who am I to not be a burden? - If I may... - I'm sorry. - Please. - Go ahead. There's the issue of burial, et cetera. Okay, well, that... that one I know we covered 'cause my family has a plot... a cemetery plot in Queens. That... that should be in there. Yes, but I see there was an amendment made by Mrs. Buchman. - There's what? - What'd I do? Yes, um, 17 years ago: a handwritten amendment stating that Mrs. Buchman elects to, instead, be cremated. Wait a second. Yeah, okay, okay. I... I kind of recall doing something. "Her ashes to be preserved and comingled with the remains of her daughter, Mabel Buchman". Okay, yeah, I know what it was. Yep, it was right after Mabel was born. I was still having these wild hormonal surges. Up and down and up and down. I was just insanely in love with being a mother and I thought, "I can't ever be separated from this child". But me, not a problem. To be honest, I think I was kind of banking on the fact that, statistically, you would probably die first. So you wouldn't know about it 'cause you'd be already dead. What else did you want to know? I just can't believe you would even consider that. I'm sorry. That's the whole point. I mean, the whole point. - "Till death do us part". - Yes, "till". "Until death". After that, we can part. Honey, I'm sorry. I truly didn't mean to hurt your feelings. - Okay. - How about this? You get cremated too. Come on, it'll be fun! Okay, well... all right, here's my concerns about cremation: first of all, it seems hot. And also, I don't know, just the whole idea... I'm so used to being in solid form. I don't know how I would do as a powder. - Hey. - Hey, sweetie. How come you're back so soon? How did, uh... how did it go with your naked parade? Got postponed to tomorrow. Couple of the girls wanted to tan first. Hey, I hope it's okay I'm whipping up a little lunch for everyone. - Yes, thank you. - That's so nice. - Hey. - He's so sweet. Here. Hey, sweetie let me ask you, all right? And honest answer. Honest answer. If you didn't have a place to visit us when we're dead, you'd be upset, right? - Sure. - See? Okay, but... but, but, but... what if I get cremated and then way down the line you get cremated and we co-mingle our ashes together, just you and me. - Eww. - See? It doesn't feel so good when someone denies you in the afterlife, does it? I... I don't understand. What do you have against being buried in Queens? I love your family, I'm fine with Queens... - But? - We always do what you want to do. Well... okay. - What? - Okay, yes. I'll get... I'll get cremated too. Really? Oh, my God, yay. You see? We're making progress. - Thank you. - Okay. So what do you want us to do with your ashes? What... what do you mean, "my ashes"? We're gonna be comingled. I thought we were gonna comingle together, right? Oh, no. I was thinking separate. I need a little space. A second ago you were very happy to comingle with our daughter. Well, that's different. That sweet baby girl comingled with me from the beginning. We've had practice. And not to continue your super creepy thought, Mom, but for my ashes to be comingled with yours, I'd have to be dead. which means for the next 50, 60 years, I'd have to drag your ashes around with me. So every time I move, I gotta remember to take you with me? I'm not signing on for that. Okay, what if we mingled us all together? Yes! No, no, no, no, no, this is good. I'll get cremated. A third goes to you... there'll be less to carry... a third to Daddy, and a third someplace pretty. Yosemite. I've never been. Just put down "undecided". Yeah, it's that... that guy, Gonzo. Okay, okay. Dick Pole, Dick Pole. Rishi, this is delicious. Oh, I'm so glad you're enjoying. Oh, here we go: "25 Creative Alternatives for Burial-Slash-Handling of Loved Ones' Remains". What a helpful guy. Why are you encouraging them? I'm just trying to be a good house guest. "First up: send them off with a Viking funeral". What is that? You put the remains on a boat, then you shoot a flaming arrow that lights the whole thing up at sea. Let's do that. Let's hear the other 24. Uh, "You can tattoo yourself using ink made of your loved ones' remains". I love that. "Compress your departed's remains and turn them into a dazzling diamond". I wanna do that. Okay, we're not gonna do that. "Scatter your loved one on the field of their favorite sports team". - Eh. - Oh, that's interesting. - Really? - I... I'm not committing. I'm... I'm just considering. I will be leaving the room now. When you guys decide to talk about something less emotionally damaging, let me know. - Go ahead. - "Shoot your dearly departed into the sky using an ash-scattering cannon". Another great one. I love all of these. I wish I could die more than once. Yeah, it's a shame. Okay, how about this: "Have your loved one's ashes ground into a paste with olive oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices to make a zesty marinade for steaks and chops". Let me hear about the Viking thing again. Penguin, penguins, penguins, penguins. Antarctica, Antarctica. Okay, cold, cold, cold. Pittsburgh Penguins, Pittsburgh Penguins. Hockey, hockey... hockey puck, hockey stick. Stick, stick. Wood, wood. Wood... wooden stick, wooden stick. Wooden pole! Dick Pole! I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! Chicka-chicka. Gonzo, you're killing me. Okay. I know you're in there, you son of a bitch. I think maybe you not so well. You know what, let's just do it your way. Let's all be buried with your family in Queens, all right? I thought you don't want to do that? I don't, but I want to keep talking about it even less. No, I want you to keep talking about it even less. - Just stop. - All right, all right. - Again, if I may... - Yes. Something my parents would do in this kind of impasse: they'd put their choices into sealed envelopes and then just pick. That way, it's decided by the hand of fate. - Okay, yes? - The... yes, that's smart. I gotta say, I don't know how we managed before - without Rishi. It's unbelievable. - Okay, so... No, so... wait, you're gonna write them down? Do you want to write them down? No, you can write them. I trust you. Do you? Yeah. - Okay, first choice. - Me? Buried together in Queens with my family. All right, got it. Second choice? Cremated, scattered in Yankee Stadium. Always wanted to play center field. - "Cremated Yankee Stadium". - Got it. The center field. Center field. Put "in center field". "Center field". You ever been to Yankee Stadium? If the timing works out, you'll come with. Okay, my first choice is "cremated and split in thirds". One third goes to you. Do whatever you want with it. One third goes to Mabel... Rishi can have my third. I hate her so much. One third Yosemite National Park. Okay, and your second choice? - Viking funeral. - No... It's my choice. All right, now what? Now, we take all the envelopes, shuffle them up... - Mm-hmm. - And then just pick. Well, who... who picks? Would you like to pick? - You can pick. - I think you should pick. - Somebody freakin' pick. - Maybe you should pick. Let's ask him to pick. Rishi, you can pick. I would be honored. - Go ahead, you pick. - Okay. Now what? Now we put it somewhere safe, ideally an independent third party. - The lawyer? - Smart. Okay, yes, yes. Perfect, and there it shall remain sealed. Neither of you can look at it until such time - as the first of you shall pass on. - Okey-dokey. Okay, I'm headed uptown anyway. You want me to drop it off? What? - Okay, not that you would... - Oh, my God. Well, how do I know that you're not gonna on the way look at it and if you don't like what it says, maybe, you know, change it to what you want? Are you kidding me? All right, I'm sorry I said that out loud. - Okay, love you. - Do you? Eh... Well, that was fun. Yeah, the kitchen was a blast. We actually have to get going too. - The protest? - Yep. Can I please persuade you to rethink this? Mm, nope. Love you. Uh, okay. Thank you so much for your hospitality. Hey, yeah, great having you. Are you sure you don't want me to help fix your neck? - It really is quite simple. - No, you know what? - I think it's probably better... - Are you sure? Wow, that's fantastic. - Thank you! - My pleasure. - Go Yankees! - Yeah. Wow. What a guy. Wow. You know, he said we can't look at the ones we picked. He never said we can't look at the ones we didn't pick. Right? Say something if I shouldn't look. You didn't mean it. "Buried together in Queens". Okay, well, guess who didn't get his first pick? - You. - What? You're a very nice girl. You opened the other envelopes? No. Okay, yes. You put my first choice in every envelope. Whatever. You care about it more than I do. If it means that much to you, that's what we should do. You... you're a nice girl. Hey, your neck! I know, can you believe it? Rishi, one crack. - Wow. - Sorry we're late. - Hey. - How'd your naked protest go? - Very successful. - Really cool. We even got some press coverage. - Oh, well, that's fortunate. - Great. Good. I think we really started an important public conversation. Yeah, I would imagine you did. - Hey, how's your neck? - It's fantastic. I gotta... I haven't turned this much since junior high. Look. Boop-boop. Here. So I broke the penguin. Nothing. Empty. Niente. - Okay, Splinky, I swear... - No, Paulie, it's coming. Trust me, it's coming. No way Gonzo dies without sticking me with that card. Is it possible that, as a man in his 60s and approaching his own death, Gonzo had, I don't know, let it go? I guess, maybe. - Uh... - Oh, pardon me. - Did you see that? - What? Did he just put something in my pocket? What? Ah, here we go: "Naked Students March On Dining Hall: Naked Lunch Turns Heads and Stomachs". Cute. Oh, great photo. - Mabel, there you are right in front! - Whoa! Ow! Neck! - I can fix it. - Don't touch. - Ira. - Oh, Louise, hi. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, this is awkward. Did we, by chance, send you a ceramic penguin? - Yes. - Oh, I'm so relieved. That was meant for my son. I'd love to get that back if I could. Oh, um... you know what? Actually, it's at home. I... I could get it to you tomorrow. Oh, no need. You can call my son - and arrange for him to pick it up. - Oh, sure. I'll tell him to expect a call from Dick Pole. Yeah, baby. Son of a bitch!
