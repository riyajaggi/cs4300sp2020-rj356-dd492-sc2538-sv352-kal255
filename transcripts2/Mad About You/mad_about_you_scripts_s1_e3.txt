 - It's so cold in here! - Leave it. I finally got it the way I like it. You poor thing. Menopause sucks. What do you think? Turn around. Super hot! I can't believe I fit into Scarlett Johansson's dress. Can I wear this to an interview? Hmm, try Scarlett Johansson's dress with Blake Lively's jacket. Yes.

 These people just let you borrow their clothes? Yeah, it's part of my house-sitting agreement with them. It's actually the unspoken part of the agreement. Until I get caught. Then there will be a lot of speaking. So we like it with the jacket? Here, here, um, try Scarlett Johansson's dress with Blake Lively's jacket and Sandra Bullock's belt. - Good? - Yeah, perfect. Young, modern professional. I don't understand why you wanna go back to work now. No, I just feel like I need something. A new purpose. Your kid's out of the house.

 You should be rock climbing and drinking tequila. Not necessarily at the same time, but well... - Oh, my God. - What? - Frigging hot flash. - Hey, do not sweat. Like I have a say in that. Oh, no. You cannot sweat in this stuff. Take off Blake's jacket! Okay, go to the kitchen. Go to the kitchen. Oh! You know, I think when we give him a name, - it's gonna be so helpful. - I don't wanna rush it. Wow, look how nice you look. Lisa stole me clothes for my interview. Really? Did you happen to bring a men's parka? It's freezing! - Don't touch it. - Okay, okay. Sweetie, I know you don't want me to suggest Mark again. - I really don't. - Okay. So the fact that he's a distinguished OB-GYN... - Babe. - And... and our dear friend... - Babe. - Okay, I'm just... I just... I'm trying to help. I want you to feel better. - Really, Paul? - Hmm? Is it about wanting my sister to feel better, or is about wanting to climb on top of her for a little bow chicka wow wow? - Okay, none of my business. - Thank you. I just know from certain sources that it's been a while for the two of you. - How did... - She asked, it came up. - I see. - Honey, you know I want to want to, right? If it weren't for the fact that I so don't want to, but if I wanted to, I would want to with you. Oh, well, that's so sweet to hear. I think it's adorable you two still even try. [PHONE RINGS] Hey, bunny face. Yes, I called earlier to confirm tonight's 6:00 at Ira's. Zero. You can bring zero people, 'cause it's our first family dinner since you started school. Emphasis, family. Yes, I love you. I'll see you then. Family dinner? Hello? Am I not family? - Yes. - Do you wanna come? Thanks. Can't. I have to feed Anderson Cooper's fish, and then Shia LaBeouf's snake is shedding. Somebody's gotta clean that up. Shia LaBeouf. Dog's name. Huh? Here, Shia LaBeouf. Hey, Shia LaBeouf. - We'll get it. - We'll get it.

Hey, where'd he go? - What... what did you do? - Nothing. - Did you scare him away? - He went to the bathroom. And why would you think I'd scare him away? Because I know you, with your snippy little remarks and your attitude. I'm not snippy. Listen, this guy is the hottest filmmaker there is right now, okay? And if his regular editor wasn't home throwing up, you would never get an opportunity like this. No need to be snippy. All I'm saying is, be professional and don't fawn over him. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Lucas Cooper. There you go, buddy. There's your new chair. - Great. Thank you. - All right. Yeah, sorry about that one. I've been meaning to replace all of them - for a while, but... - Oh, yeah, no worries, man. Okay, you got everything you need? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, so I just want to watch... Anything else comes up, whatever you need, let me know. Here to help. Cool. All right, so if you could just bring it back to the part wh... I gotta say... I'm sorry. You know what? I've been trying to play it cool since you got here, but I gotta say, I'm a huge fan. Loved your film. Ah, thank you, man. I appreciate that. Yeah. For a first film, it's fantastic. And look at you now. Your second movie, a big studio production. Hee! Pretty... pretty nice to be you, I would imagine, huh? It's not terrible. You're a filmmaker yourself, right? Used to be. Swear to God, as soon as it came out of my mouth, - I already felt bad. - Yeah. Run it from the top? Yeah. You know what? I was gonna make a couple changes, but I think we're good. Send it. - For real? - Yeah. It's perfect. Send it to the studio. Unless you wanna take a look. Wanna see what a perfect film looks like? I-I don't want to overstay my welcome. Oh, no. Pull up a chair. I c... you know what? I'll stand. Okay. Hello. Thank you for meeting with me, Ms. Martin. Oh, Meg. Please, take a seat. I looked for you on LinkedIn. Oh, no. I'm not on that, but I brought you a résumé, analog style. Not to worry. You're an autumn hire. We like placing those. Well, it's autumn. Isn't everyone an autumn hire right now? [LAUGHS] No, autumn as in... Ah. Old. Got it. - Seasoned. - Yes. Let's see. You worked in PR, you had a stint in the mayor's office, and then, oh, wow, earned an MSW master's degree. Yes, but I never got my counseling hours. Um, I decided to stay home and raise my daughter. - She just started college. - Are you okay? I'm so good. Can you open a window? I'm sorry. They don't open. - Of course they don't. - [LAUGHS] So we're dealing with a 16-year employment gap. Well, as I said, - I chose to stay home and... - No worry. We'll find a way to frame it. Maybe frame it as raising a human being. Are you sure you're feeling okay? I'm fine. You know Scarlett Johansson? She, um... Doesn't matter. Okay. So Jamie, why don't we talk about where you see yourself in the near future? Ideally, Alaska. [LAUGHS] 'Cause it's colder. Look at you, how young and dry you are. If you're not feeling well, perhaps we should reschedule for a better day. There's no better day. This is every day. Listen, I apologize if I... You didn't do anything. I'm gonna go. You were perfectly lovely, sitting there in your... plump, elastic skin, with your estrogen keeping you nice and cozy in your sweater, but trust me, it's coming for you. - Help. - Sit. Now, in terms of easing menopause symptoms, the first thing we usually like to do is try some hormone replacement. I don't like the risks. I understand. Diet and exercise help. What kind of exercise you getting? Crying and sweating. How's your libido? Copy that. Well, the good news is, is that this doesn't last forever. Seven, ten years, tops. Eh, sometimes longer. There has to be something. Not really. Well, hold on. What? Well, there is something we can try. It's just, I don't know whether I'm allowed to share. - Please share. - Ah, what the hell? I got my hands on this cream from Canada. Now, it's still undergoing trials, but they've been reporting some very positive results: improved sleep, more appetite, better libido, It's all natural. Has a lovely maple scent. I want it. Oh, okay. It has some side effects: nausea, headaches, suicidal thoughts... I've already got all those. Give it to me. No, no, not there. Inside the elbow. Small, dime-sized bit. Once every 24 hours, no more. - Thank you. - You're welcome. But if anybody from Ottawa calls, you don't know me. - You know what I'm thinking? - What? I'm thinking about where I'm gonna put my Academy Award! - [LAUGHS] - That there is a thing of beauty. You send that to the studio right now, baby. - Perfect, right? - It's really good. Send it. Can I say... [STAMMERS] Can I... can I offer one thought? Dear God. Go ahead. I know the payoff hinges on the scene in the park, but the way you have it now, kind of drags, right? But if you cut it up, cut it in little pieces, and then you scatter those throughout the whole movie, then I think it has more of an impact. Maybe. I don't know. Just a thought. No, man. This... this totally works. - Yes, it does. - Yeah. Course it does. You're right. Should I hit send? Well, mm... no. No, he's right. It drags. It totally drags. I-I'm an idiot. We... we gotta recut the whole thing. Thank you, brother. Thank you so much. Yeah. [VENOMOUSLY] Thanks. Yeah. We're gonna be here all day, all... all night, all week, maybe. Oh, damn. I forgot I had that NYU thing tomorrow. Huh? My... my daughter goes to NYU. Why do I say yes to these things? What's the... what are you doing? I have to speak to some "language of film" class or something. That's... I think that's my daughter's class. - Really? - Yeah. Great. Why don't you do it? [LAUGHS] What? I'll stand there instead of you? - Yeah, yeah! - I don't think so. You can screen one of your films. I'll say it was a scheduling conflict, and in my place, I'm sending in an esteemed colleague... tell me your name again. - Paul Buchman. - Paul Buchman, whose documentary work has had a profound influence on me. - Huh? - Like you've seen my films? No, but they don't know that. - I-I... - Come on. You'd be doing me a really big favor. I don't know. That's a... I don't know. Can I think about it? What, you got more chairs to fix? It's like a sickness with me. I see it. Is it working? What? Your... your magic cream. Do you feel anything yet? Okay, sorry. Understood. It's just, let's stay positive, 'cause, you know, if it does work, eating and sleeping and not overheating and, you know... [QUIETLY] sex, all positive things. Ooh, you smell good. What is that, maple? I honestly don't feel anything yet. Pass the bread, please. - I'm late. - There she is. - Hey, hey. - I had to un-invite all the people you wouldn't let me bring. Oh. What smells like pancakes? Okay, family dinner. All here, so... Just so you know, Lucia and I are having a little recipe competition tonight. So first course: Melanzane alla parmigiana. Two versions: her way and my way. And that's... you know, it's not to say that one is better than the other, but... yeah, tell me which one is better. Mangia. Well, here's something for you. Guess who's gonna be guest speaker in your class tomorrow. Lucas Cooper, yeah, - but I heard he canceled. - Right. Guess who's taking his place. What are you... What do you mean, taking his... Mm-hmm. I don't... what? He happens to be cutting his new film at our lovely facility. We got to chatting, and yeah, he asked me to stand in for him, show one of my films. - In my class? - Yeah. You're gonna come... - you're gonna come speak to my class? - Yeah. You in my class. Well... I hope you told him no! Well, I-I anticipated you might feel that way... Uh, yeah! So if you don't want me to do it... - I don't. - All you gotta do is say so. It is... it's literally, like, the worst idea ever. Again, I'm saying, it's totally up to you. Okay, look at me. I don't want you to do this. Please. Okay. Glad I asked. I appreciate the honesty. Well, I appreciate the understanding. Gotta wash my hands. What? You already said yes, didn't you? I may have, yes. And now, we have two interpretations of fettucine ai funghi porcini. Okay, first course, which one did you like better? And be honest. Nobody's gonna be insulted here. We're professionals. - That one. - That's what I was gonna say. - Yah! - Ah! [LAUGHS] Gotta say, he's taking the loss pretty well. Yeah. So the class? Ah, I'll just get out of it. It's okay. I thought it might be fun, but, uh, yeah, she was pretty clear about not wanting me there. So... why do I have no napkin here? I can't believe Dad would even consider doing this. - Mm. - What? Oh, just say it. You want me to let Dad come speak to my class. You think I should let him come, don't you, because it would make him feel good, and it would be good for him to do it, right? - Mm. - Mm... Okay, fine, you win. Just stop yelling at me. All righty. - Uh, so Dad... - Yes? Never mind what I said before. I was... I was being horrible. Of course you can come speak to my class. Really? Are you sure? With one condition. Don't blow raspberries on your belly and say, "Who's my little stinky?" Okay, listen to me. No one can know we're related, because that would be really uncomfortable for me. - Sure. - I'm serious. Once you're in that room, I don't know you, you don't know me. Agreed? - Y-yeah. - No, say it. What, gotta take a vow? Okay. Yes, uh, no one will know we're related, I promise. I promise, yes. Okay. Man, my little stinky's so strict. Why do I have no napkin? I don't know. Thank you, by the way. For what? Whatever you said to Mabel. I didn't say one thing. Okay, the pasta. Which one do you like better? And again, there are no wrong answers here. - I like this. - That one. - Yah! - Oh. Bravo. So apparently there are no losers in this competition. Hey, maybe that cream is working. - Look, your appetite is back. - Yeah. Maybe some other appetites will be coming back. Don't go crazy. You done with that? Yeah, Mark, I don't think it's working. The appetite? Nothing with the appetite? I'm slightly hungrier, but that's about it. That's surprising. All right, what about the sleep? - Nope. - [DOORBELL RINGS] Hey, nothing in the libido department, huh? Nothing so far. I'll let you know. Thanks again. Hey, emergency. I need the clothes back. Blake's coming home a day early, and Scarlett's back tomorrow, so... How'd the interview go? Great. I lost four pounds. Oh, no. Scarlett's dress. Sweat stains. Huge sweat stains. Did you sweat? Because I specifically... - I told you not to sweat. - I know. - I'll get it dry cleaned. - No, there's no time. Ugh, it's all sweaty and... [SNIFFS] Did you rub this in pancakes? Okay, okay, go to the couch. Go to the couch. I think a name's gonna be so helpful. Your wife has jeopardized my impeccable house-sitting reputation. Now my clients are gonna realize - that I steal from them. - Well... Thanks for the clothes. You're the best sister in the world. Let's have coffee soon. Good luck with the snake. - I love you. Bye-bye. - Wait! What's going on? Oh. Canada? Mm. Mm! So sorry. I have to pee. - I'll meet you in there. - Okay. I shall await you in our marital bed. Oh, I'm so excited about this. I don't even know h... I'm so very happy, honey. And by the way, you know, it's been a while, so, uh, I'm not guaranteeing anything in the quality control area, but, you know, we can always go again after. Although at my age, my refractory period is, like, 2 1/2 months, so don't worry, you're gonna have plenty of time to get ready for round two. But it'll be good. This is very exciting. Honey? Sweetie? Honey? I know, I know. We just have to figure out the timing. It seems like the horny is a short window between the hungry and the sleepy. Yeah, okay. So yesterday, when did you first apply the cream? At Mark's, just after 1:00. Okay, 1:00. And then? And then I was starving from 5:00 till 8:00, - and then I jumped on you. - Okay. So that's seven hours. Okay, and... and did you put on the cream already today? - 9:15. - 9:15. Okay, so by my calculations, the window will next be open at exactly 4:15 today, and I just did that in my head, by the way. Where will you be at 4:15? - Oh, I'm gonna be right here. - Perfect. Yes. And you know what? If you could be here at that time, too, that would be super. Well, we're sorry Mr. Cooper wasn't able to join us, but we're certainly glad to have you here. - Thank you. - He spoke very highly of you. Are you and he working on anything together? Uh, well, yeah, he's cutting his new film, so I'm helping him out with that, and I fixed his chair. I think you'll find our students are really quite engaged. - [CELL PHONE BUZZES] - Oh, I'm s... I'm sure they'll have a lot to say about your film, uh, "The Last Viennese Baker in New York". Yeah, fascinating older gentleman. He's... he's a... Wow. Get... I get a spasm. I got a rotator cuff, and it's just... a lot. Sorry, I didn't... You the guy they sent instead? Ah, I am, yes. Hope you won't be too disappoint... - [CELL PHONE BUZZES] - Excuse me. - One second. - Sure. Uh, yeah. Hi, honey, what's up? Everything okay? I just thought you'd like to know the window is now open. So close it. What do you want from me? [EMPHATICALLY] The window. Oh, the window. Do... now? No, no, no, are you sure? No, that's not supposed to be open for another two hours. Well, I don't know what to tell you, and as much as I'd like it to be you, doesn't have to be. I can make a few calls. I... hang on. I'll be right there. Um... I have to run out for a quick thing. But we're just about to start. No, please, start the film. I've seen it many times, um, and it's good. Uh, I... I just gotta run home. It's five blocks away, and I'll be back in plenty of time for the Q&A; afterwards, okay? - Okay, but if... - This won't take long. Trust me. Okay, I'm home! I'm here! Ready for the window treatment! [SIGHS] Okay, well, "The Last Viennese Baker in New York". Let's hear your comments and thoughts. Okay, yeah, um, I couldn't help but notice there were no women in the film. Uh, that's not untrue. Well, 'cause it was... it was about that one guy, who... and that guy was a guy. So yeah, I can't control that. Yes? But aren't we viewing his world through your lens? That's true, yes. Very... very good. Um, but you always have to put it in the context, you know, of the subject, so that bakery in that place in that time. But don't we, as men, have to stop making the excuse, "Well, that was the culture then"? I, um... I don't know that I was making an excuse. - I don't feel... - What about the women in his world? The guy's mother? His mother? Uh, well, he was 92, so the mother, I'm guessing... dead. Or his wife or sister. Uh, well, I don't... I don't... I mean, there had to be a woman somewhere in the kitchen. [ALL MURMURING AGREEMENT] Hey, can we... can we let the guy talk? Thank you, honey. Whoa. Did you just call her honey? No, not in the way that you think. No, she's my... She's your what? Your adorable five-year-old niece? No, she's my... shi smai. [CLEARS THROAT] Shi smai is a... anybody speak Mandarin? Uh, good. Uh, uh, shi smai. It's a... it's a colloquialism the Chin... uh, Mandarin. Uh, they use... they use it to negate the phrase immediately preceding, like, you know, in English, we say, "Nice hat... not"? Right? So the "not" would negate the compliment of the hat. So I'm saying "Honey, shi smai". Not? Right? So it's like, "Not honey". Not honey. - Yeah, I'm gonna call bullshit on that. - Yeah. Why not call it like it is? You're just another misogynist who doesn't get it. Uh, believe me. I'm not a misogynist. No, the truth is... Uh, the truth is, yes, I am a misogynist, and, uh, I'll tell you something else. Frankly, I think a lot of you gals would be a lot prettier if you smiled. - Okay? - [ALL GROANING] Just, you know... Okay. [FRUSTRATED EXHALATION] Oh, hello. Hey. How'd it go with the class? Well, interesting you would ask that. Let's see, uh... let's see if this doesn't paint a picture for you. Hey, it's Lucas Cooper. What'd you do, man? I heard you blew up the room, and not in a good way. Call me. Oh, my God. What happened? - [LAUGHS] You don't even wanna know. - Was Mabel just mortified? She's fine, she's fine. She's clean. As far as anybody knows, I am just an unredeemable pig of a guy. But our vow of anonymity was upheld. You're a very nice father and a very nice man. Just so I'm clear, is this the cream? Mm, I'm not sure. Wait a second. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this a pity thing? No. Maybe. What do we care? I don't care. Mm, and you're not getting sleepy yet. - Nope. - So this is on. - This is on, baby. - This is on. Hello! - And it's off, okay. - Hi, sweetie! - Ah. - I brought Thai food, because Dad did a very nice thing today. Yes, I did. Yes, that's so sweet and thoughtful of you to do that. You know what, though, we are sadly out of? Beverages. We have no beverages, which would go so great with the Thai food, so would you be an angel and run down to the s... don't run, actually. Take your time, nice and safe, right? - Better safe than sorry. - Actually, you know what? I think I'm gonna go lie down for a minute. No, no, no! No, no, no! Honey, what about the pity? We got pity! We'll always will have the pity, and the cream just knocks me out. Ah. You know, you'd be a lot prettier if you smiled. A recall? You're kidding. Why? Six women? We talking peach fuzz or a full beard? Trace amounts of cocaine? Holy Malloy. No, no, I haven't given it to anybody. Yeah, my pleasure. Uh, thank you for calling. Jamie? Funny thing...
