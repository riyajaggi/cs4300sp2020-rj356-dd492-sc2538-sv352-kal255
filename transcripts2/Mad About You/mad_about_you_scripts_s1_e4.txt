 Unbelievable. - Why would you do that? - Sorry. What happened? What did I do? It was right there in front of me the whole time. I can't believe I didn't see it. Okay, just to be clear, you not seeing whatever you didn't see, that wasn't my fault, right? I figured out what I'm gonna do with my life. Okay. I just talked to Tonya. I'm gonna get my hours at her practice.

 Help me? I have my Master's. Yes, your SML... SMS... FFMS? MSW. Masters in Social Work. I was so close, yes. I have the degree, but do you remember why I never got my patient hours? Remind me. Because to be a licensed therapist, you need 2,000 hours of supervised counseling. Which seems excessive. Exactly, so I mentioned that to Tonya and she said, "Why don't you let me supervise you?" How great is that? To be supervised by my friend

 who also happens to be a brilliant shrink. Oh, that is genius. I have been spinning around in circles about my next move, and this was staring me in the face the whole time. I can't believe I didn't think of it. Oh, that's fantastic, honey. - Why didn't you think of it? - There it is. Hey, riddle me this. Everywhere you go, they're selling matcha. People are drinking matcha, they're eating matcha... I don't know what matcha is. Nobody knows what matcha is! It's green tea. Okay. So what's going on here? What are you doing? I'm digitizing all the scrapbooks I put together for Mabel. Why? So she'll have them. Once I'm busy with work, I'm not gonna have time to do it. I've been meaning to get to this forever. I think it's so cute that you think she's gonna actually want any of these. Of course she will. Have you met our daughter? She's not a sentimental person. And she hates seeing pictures of herself. It's not just pictures. There's also... You saved her teeth? Yes and her hair from her first haircut and her tiny toenails. Well, this is great, in case you ever have to build her again from scratch. Everybody saves their kid's teeth. All right, this is all of them. So I've got zero to two, two to four, nine, all the way up to... Wait a minute. What happened to 13 through 15? You know what, as I recall, those were not great years. Maybe you threw it out. Sfogliatelle! Same to you. Sfogliatelle, wait till you taste this. - Buongiorno. - Buongiorno. This woman never made pastries before in her life. First attempt. James, look at this. Is this not a thing of beauty? No, no, no, no. English, English. Come on, we've gotta practice. He so embarrass me. Everything I do is "most best". No, "is best". Si. Something is the best or you like it the most. We don't say "most best". This is what I say. "Most best". These are beautiful. Okay, no kidding. That's the most best. Do you guys want some coffee? - Yeah, sure. - No, grazie. Is okay. You stay, I go to restaurant, open up. All right, you know what? I'll walk out with you. Hey, hey, come here. Mmm. You're gonna see her in like a half an hour! Good-bye, my love. Time will crawl until I see you again. Oh, boy, you guys must miss a lot of buses. What? How do you two say good-bye? Watch. Bye, babe. See ya. Oh, boy, oh boy. You two are great together. James, I know. I don't even know what to do with myself. You know, I think I may have to marry this woman! - For real? - Yes! No, no. I don't know. You know, after Marianne, I swore that I would never marry again, but now it's like I am dizzy. It's like I don't know what to do with all this love. James, I can't stop thinking about marriage. It's like some horrible magnet pulling me in. That's just what they say. Marriage is a horrible magnet. Listen, you did not ask my advice... No, no, no, no. I am. You seem a little ambivalent. I think you should take a minute and think about it. This is not a decision that should be made impulsively. Yeah... yeah. You're right. James, this is why you're gonna be a great therapist. You're smart, level-headed... you are the sanest person that I know. What are these, teeth? Hey, how's it going? Hi. Yasmeen? Oh, God, I'm still here. What's going on? Where's... where's Lucas? Possibly out in the street banging his head against a wall, wondering why he listened to your stupid note that blew up his whole movie. Or maybe the bathroom. You know what, I find it hard to believe that my one little suggestion... Ruined the movie? Yeah, it did. And the guy who made it. You happy? You took America's hottest director and you broke him. Well, I certainly didn't mean to... Okay, let's get back to... oh... you. - I just came in to apologize. - Okay. If I caused any trouble with the one little suggestion I made, which I was reluctant to share, if you recall, I truly apologize. Got it. Can we get back to work, please? I have to get home and feed my cat. Or bury my cat. Okay, show me. And I want you to follow orders. Close the damn airlock! Okay, that's good. Next. What are you... what are you doing... what is that? It's a chess clock. It accelerates the decision-making process and ends a lot of disagreements. And here's this one, I trimmed it up. No, go back to the way it was. - You sure? - Definitely. What's next? Okay, that's really... that's so smart. That's really cool. I can't say anything because he's my boss, but you should tell him to leave. Please leave. I sense it's not coming from you, but okay, yes, I'll leave. Hold on. Tomorrow morning, 10:00 sharp. I got the big studio muckety-mucks coming, - so I'm gonna need you... - You want me to sit in and watch you? - No, God no! - Are you insane? Okay, why is everybody yelling? I need everything to go 100% smoothly, okay? Make sure the place is clean, pay your electrical bill, make sure there's coffee and Danish... nothing can go wrong. - You got it. - Okay... and open up early because there'll be here early. Okay, you got it. Okay, here's the next change. It's not about what's fair, it's about what's right. That's good. Next. You sure about going to the close-up there? I'm gonna leave. Time me. - Oh, you're still at it? - Yep. Any luck finding your mysteriously missing scrapbook? Nope, I turned this place upside down. I did find three dead remotes, $1.37 in change and a mouse skeleton. Maybe Murray's imaginary mouse... Not so imaginary. And I found an old joint, which I smoked. Oh, no, no, honey. Pot makes you paranoid. Who told you that? I stand... I stand corrected. How much of it did you smoke? - All of it. - All of it? I don't know... pot was old, I don't think it worked. Anyway, the scrapbook's gone. Someone stole it. I think the pot's working. What's that? This, my friend, is a gift for you. Little something I thought might come in handy as you start this new chapter of your professional career. - Honey, that's so sweet. - It's a clock. It's a chess clock. Yeah! Isn't it cool? You know I'm gonna be a therapist, not an old man in Central Park, right? Yeah, but I figured, you know, when you were with a patient and the session's over, you could go, "Time's up". Yes, and then he can go, "Bishop to King 4". Sure. If he wants to do that, there's no reason he couldn't do that with this. It's very, very, sweet. Thank you. Yeah, I always wanted one of these... The only other person who could've taken it... Who take... what, what? The scrapbook. The only other person who could have taken it is Mabel. Sweetie, not to hurt your feelings, Mabel does not care about a scrapbook. I promise you. We'll see. I'm texting her. Well, James, I took your advice. I asked Lucia to marry me. Guess what? She said no. What... wait, what... what? You're getting married? Not if you go by what I just said. I am... confused. You told him to ask her? I'm a little high, but I don't think I said that. Hey, come on, it's all right, it's all good. I'm... I'm gonna cook something. You guys... you guys mind if I cook something? I'm gonna cook something. Who's hungry? - I'm starving. - Yeah, I bet you are. - Ira, are you sure you're... - Ah... ah. Got it. Best piece of cooking advice I ever got? Start with a pot of boiling water. 'Cause chances are, no matter what you're making, at some point, you're gonna want a pot of boiling water, right? Ira, are you sure you're okay? What, about Lucia? Yes, I'm great. I mean, look, if it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be. So now I know. Asked and answered. Okay, let's see what you got here. Who am I texting again? Mabel. Hey... I'm confused. When... when Lucia said no, are you sure you understood her correctly? Oh, I understood her just fine. She said no. In English or Italian? What's the Italian word for no? No. Oh, very similar, I gotta say. - What is this? - Ooh, that looks good to me. It just... it doesn't make any sense. Look, we know... I think this is spoiled. We know Lucia's crazy about you, right? So can you think of any reason why she wouldn't want to get married? Nope, although there was that agreement we had where we both swore that no matter what happens, we'd never get married. I don't think you told me that. - What? - We both had bad experiences, so the thinking was maybe marriage was something we shouldn't do. Well, then maybe it's for the best. What you have going is going great, so let it be what it is. Hey, marriage isn't for everyone. Yeah. Wait, what? Eh, it's not. I mean, you and I happen to be very good at it. Why am I texting your mother? Okay, you know what, maybe put down the phone, Cheech. - I'm such an idiot. - No, no, no, hey. No, it's true. Everything was going great and now I messed it all up. What is wrong with me? You know... I can't cook now. There's semi-hot water here if you want. I'm gonna go lie down for a while in Mabel's room. - Of course. - Yeah... oh, there's no bed. I don't deserve a bed! This is really disappointing. I think he'll be okay. No, I'm saying I'm really hungry. A word of advice? Maybe stop when you hit table. If you care at all about keeping me under 300 pounds, do not let me get high again. - Here you go. - Thank you. Can I get you folks anything else? - Another piece of pie? - No... no. We don't wanna fill up. Remember, we've got that pot of tepid water at home. This whole Ira thing... I'm so confused. - Before you convinced him to propose... - I didn't. But, did he give any reason, like why he wants to get married all of a sudden? He was dizzy talking about love, there was singing... Yeah, but you know what, that's Ira all the time. Just doesn't make any sense. Why would somebody wanna get married at our age? I mean, are you kidding? Like we would have the strength to be newlyweds? I don't have the strength to be newly anything. If you ask me, they dodged a bullet. Think of all the petty stuff - they won't have to deal with now. - Really. Thank God that's all behind us. What? - Just forget about it. - No, don't do that. If you have something you wanna say... No, because you obviously don't get it. - Oh, okay. Please, don't say that. - What? Okay, 'cause I hate when you say I don't get it. Well I hate when you don't get it. - Look. - I just don't understand. We're leaving a restaurant, you grab yourself a toothpick, but you don't think to get one for me. Okay, look. It's not that I deliberately... I know, I know. I know. You didn't deliberately not get me one, it just didn't occur to you to get me one. That's all I'm saying. How does it not occur to you when we've been having this conversation for 25 years? Okay, 'cause, look... You know what? I'm just gonna make it simple moving forward, okay? Here's the rule. If you're getting something for yourself, whatever it is, a toothpick, a cup of coffee, a stick of gum, ask and see if I would like one, too, okay? Does that make sense? Of... yes, of course, absolutely it does, yes. Thank you. - However. - Oh, my God. In this particular situation, the reason it didn't occur to me... Please let me find another joint to smoke. The reason it didn't occur to me is that, because in all the years I've known you, I've never seen you use a toothpick ever. That's because you've never offered me one. You... look, I get your point. I understand the point that if I'm getting something, you know, nice, I should see if you'd like one, too. - Yes, that's all I'm saying. - I understand. That makes perfect sense. But let me... just, okay, as an example. Okay, say I have an itch, right? A little itch in the back of my neck. Now, my natural instinct would be to scratch it, right? Taking care of a momentary need. Is that being inconsiderate? Like, am I supposed to stop and think, "You know, I wonder if Jamie's neck itches too? Maybe as long as I'm scratching, I could scratch..." I mean, that would be nuts, don't you think? I gotta tell you, one of us doesn't survive this. Point being, I only grabbed a toothpick for myself because I had a thing in my teeth. It wasn't a luxury item and by the way, I think it would be presumptuous of me to assume you have something in your teeth. Any chance you guys could keep it down? - Oh, hi. - Sorry. - How are you doing? - I'm better. Thanks... thanks for letting me stay. You stay as long as you want. You're the best. I promise I won't be a bother. You're out of toilet paper. Look, this... this is getting silly. - Oh. - If, you know, okay... if you know that this silly toothpick thing, for whatever reason, is a blind spot for me, why can't you just accept that, enjoy all the things you do like about me, and let this one go? Because even though you think it's silly, it means something to me. Why can't you just accept that? - Okay, because... - And admit that you were wrong. That... you see, okay. I know... I know how much you like to be right. I don't like to be right, I'm just usually right. - Ha! - What? Mabel has the book. - What book? - The scrapbook. The scrapbook that you thought she wasn't sentimental enough to want? She has it and she's bringing it back tomorrow. - So that means I was... - Whatever. Yeah, yeah, it seems like the whole time I was... Yeah, I wasn't so much wrong as I was... Okay, yes, you were right. Thank you. However... Oh, my gosh, look at this. Just a little thank you nibble. Totally unnecessary. Hey... whoa, Ira, you're feeling better, huh? Much better. I woke up this morning and I realized Lucia's exactly right. We're happy. Why should we change anything? Exactly. And like you said, marriage isn't for everyone. Right. Yeah, and frankly, listening to you two argue about a toothpick for 40 straight minutes... not exactly a selling point. - Have a good one. - All right. See ya. Okay, sweetie, I gotta get going, too. I gotta open up early. Big mucky-mucks coming. Are we good with the toothpick thing? - I'm good. - Great, me, too. - Great. - Great. All right, I love you. I'll see you later. Love you. And by the way, if I'm such an inconsiderate guy, would I have gotten you such a nice clock? Nobody said you were inconsiderate. Exactly so, checkmate. Never mind the fact that it's something you wanted and makes no sense as a gift for me. So... double checkmate. Well, for your information, there's no such thing as double checkmate, so... For your information, the reason I would never know that is that I don't give a shit. I don't know about chess. I don't care about chess! Well, then I guess you won't be needing this. - Hey. - Hi, look who's here. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi, honey. Oh, this is so great. Oh, I just wanted to drop off... ooh, what's that? It's a chess clock. Would you like it? Is it okay if I leave a load of a laundry to do later? Sure, do you want me to do it for you? That's kind of what I meant when I said, "do it later". Sweetie, did you remember to bring the scrapbook? I did, yep. It's right here. Hope it's okay I borrowed it. Of course, and Daddy thought you weren't sentimental. I'm not what? I think it's so nice you wanted a keepsake. A little something from home to take to school and show your friends. Is that what you thought? Yes, why else would you take it? I brought it in for my psych class. We were talking about obsessive compulsive behavior and attachment issues. But... did you see what a beautiful job Mommy did on these books for you? - These are beautiful. - Oh, yeah. The books are so nice and they're, like, crazy thorough. Not crazy... I'm saying thorough. Yes, right. I gotta go. Thanks for the laundry. - Love you. - Love you. Thank you for not gloating about the book in front of her. Yeah, well, hey, listen, you know I would never disagree with you in front of the kid. Wait a second... okay, I think I know what's been happening here recently. Yes. Ever since Mabel left, I... I think I've been pushing back a little more. As opposed to? As opposed to before... all those years, whenever there was a disagreement between us, I would try to keep the peace for Mabel's sake. I did a lot of acquiescing. - Really? - Yes. And I think... I think I've done you a terrible disservice. - Really? - Yes, because I... I've led you to believe you're much more right than you actually are. You're not that right. And you know what? If something ever, God forbid, happened to me and you were pushed out into the wild to argue, I don't think you would survive with your false sense of argument success. Hmm... I think I would do just fine in the wild. You wanna worry? I'd worry about the wild. She said yes. What? I'm heading over there to apologize, I get like halfway down the block, Lucia calls. She says she's the one who should apologize and yes, of course, she'll marry me. And then you decided to come here? So you're getting married? It appears so. But you just said you didn't want to. - I don't. - Why don't you tell that to Lucia? Because she just said yes. How does it look if she says yes and I say, "You know, I changed my mind. Let's just stick with no". Oh, Ira. You know, and... and she wants me to invite you guys to dinner tonight to celebrate. To celebrate this engagement you didn't mean to have? - Yes. - Well, we'll be there for that, sure. Ira, Ira... Well now, you told me. You were right. "Don't make an impulsive decision". So stupid... Paulie, listen to this woman. Always. She is always right. You're so not helping here. A meal like that, you gotta cap off with a little grappa... there you go. Okay, well to Ira and Lucia, may your marriage be long and fruitful and may you have the same joy we have had. - Salud. - Salud. Wow, mother of God, that's just horrible. - Wow, that's delicious. - Hit me again. You see, that's why we're so good together, 'cause we agree on everything. So, tell us. What is secret for long years marriage? Oh, well, you're asking the right people 'cause the great thing about us? We never argue, never fight. Yeah, right. They've been fighting over a toothpick for the last 24 hours. We've been fighting over that toothpick for the last 25 years. That's why you have to get married and stay married, 'cause a lot of these fights, they take forever. If you get out too early, then you never find out who wins. - It's about communication. - That's what I'm trying to say. It's about who wins the communication. You know, here's a question. And I want you to answer honestly. Why did you change your mind? Why did you say yes after you said no? Because I love you. And you want to be married, yes? Okay, I'm gonna ask you again, and this time, don't think about me, I want... I want you to answer honestly, but for yourself. Lucia Francavella, will you marry me? Yes. Lucia Francavella... do you want to marry me? Do I want to? No, not really. Me neither. - So, okay! - So we leave it the way it is? - Si! - We don't get married? Yes, like I say first time. Lucia, oh you've made me the happiest man in the world. - Okay. - All right. We've seen this part before. All right, you two, cut it out. Hey, just... just so we're clear, we just had a fantastic meal celebrating the fact that you're not getting married? - Si! - Exactly. - Works for me. - Buona sera. - All right, good night... - This is a wonderful woman. - You should marry her. - Don't get him started again. - Aww, was that so hard? - Yeah, yeah, watch. You probably won't even use it now. - Oh, I'll use it. - Ow! I gotta say again, it just feels completely unfair that the studio would accuse you of locking them out of the building when I was only 15 minutes late. It was an hour. But that... that was my fault, that wasn't your fault. Actually, it was my wife's fault, but let's not dredge that up again. Listen, if you like, I can call the studio and... okay. But hey, if you ever do need any post-production facility in the future, I certainly hope you'll consider... Yeah, that's probably a no...
