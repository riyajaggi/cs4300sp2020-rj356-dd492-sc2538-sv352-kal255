 {\an8}Which of you is the owner of the white car? {\an8}-It's me. -And this one? {\an8}That's me. {\an8}You should go to the hospital first. You can come to the police station later. {\an8}Okay. Are you all right? I'm fine, so stop looking at me like that. Sorry? Okay. I believe you. I can believe you...

 because it's me. How can you believe it? Sorry? Believe what? What I said earlier. That you and your mom will die because of Yu-beom. I'd never believe it if I were you. It'd make me angry. It didn't make me angry. I really believe that you saved me. Why do you believe me? I'm not saying I lied to you. You had a dream, right? And the things that happened in your dream kept happening in real life.

 Right? How do you know that? I dream those dreams too. And those dreams happen in real life, no matter what. Just like your dreams. {\an8}Are you okay? You're sweating. I think she's feeling hot in here. You're fine. Right, honey? Yes. You repeatedly dream those dreams? Yes, I dream those quite often. Was it your first time? Yes. How far in the future do you dream? I'm not asking because I believe you. It's random. Sometimes a month later, and sometimes the next day. Sometimes it happens a few minutes later. They never fail to happen? Never. Some dreams haven't happened in real life yet. But they always end up happening. Have you ever stopped it? That's why it's amazing that you stopped it. I really saved a person's life? You did. Then what happens now? I mean... I'm not asking because I believe you. But what if... What if I really changed the future? No, let's say I really changed the future. What happens then? I'm not sure. Just like how the water flows in another direction if you block flowing water, as you stopped something that was supposed to happen from happening, maybe time will flow in another direction. I really need to lose some weight. Why were you so late today? Don't even talk about it. I almost died today. I'll die if I don't lose some weight. Yes, I've always tried to keep myself in good shape and practiced really hard. Ms. Park, you're the first Korean to ever advance to the finals of the Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. How do you feel right now? A lot of people have supported me. And I hope I'll live up to their expectations-- -What is it? -What's going on? -Mom! -Honey! Ma'am! Hey, call 911. Now! -Mom! -Honey! -What's happening? -Please do not take photos. What's this? -What? -Don't take photos. It wasn't me. I didn't do this. Is this the police? I'm calling from Iban Art Hall to report domestic violence. I told you, I didn't do this! Please move. Mom, wake up. -Yes, hurry up. -Mom. If time flows in another direction, which direction do you mean? The better future? Or the worse? I've never seen such a case yet. So I don't know either. But one thing is certain. At first, it won't seem like anything has changed. Then, as time passes, the differences between the two futures will become bigger. You know who I am? So-yun... Are you okay? Why did you come here? Well... I was nearby, so I just dropped by. You, don't you dare tell the others about what happened here today. You didn't see anything here. Understand? Okay. I won't say anything. Never. Good. Thank you. I'm sure that time started flowing in another direction from this moment on. I'm not sure which direction, though. I guess you're right. Now it's my turn. Why did you come to save me? It was just a dream for you then. What's the reason you came to save me, even crashing your new car? I don't know. I guess you don't know why. But it's obvious to me. What's obvious? When did you start... having feelings for me? What? Feelings? For whom? I have feelings for you? I think you've got the wrong idea. It started when I hugged you, right? That's why you hugged me back. No. I just hugged you back because you hugged me first. There were no feelings. But you hugged me for so long. You even patted me on my back. -Do you hug just any woman like that? -No. That means I'm not just any woman. What was it? Why was I special to you? What did you like about me? Why are you so sure I fell for you? Wait, I guess not. You hugged me after you saved me, so you fell for me before that. Then... was it at the bus stop? Or... Don't tell me... Was it when you brought the rice cake? I knew it. That's when, right? Did you like my voice that much? Unbelievable. Wait. Did you move into that house because of me? Gosh, this is driving me crazy. THE GOOD Which police station? Okay. What are you getting charged with? THE BAD I've got goosebumps. You moved into that house because of me, right? THE WEIRD Are you all right? Come on, wake up. Just five more minutes. You're going to be late. You're late! Hey! You little... What time is it? Hey, fix me a bowl too. You fix it yourself. I'm not in the mood. Why are you so sensitive out of the blue? Is being 18 that stressful? Jae-chan, I... What? Don't you dare tell the others about what happened here today. -Never mind. -What? Why are you being mysterious? By the way, what's going on with that woman? Are you going out with her? You want to die, right? Is your life so boring, huh? Why? You were so worried about her the other day. You even crashed your car to save her. Mom, I think that guy fell head over heels in love with me. That guy? Who? You know, the guy who's moved in across the street. Oh, my. Then what about the lawyer guy Yu-beom? Mom, don't even talk about him. Okay? He would've put the blame on me to save himself. So, are you breaking up with him? Then what? Keep dating him? The guy who would've been the end of you and me? Then you'll date the guy next door instead? Well... it's not like that for now. I'm just repaying him. Repaying him? For what? I mean, Jae-chan saved not only my life, but also your life. I should repay him for that for the rest of my life. That's what a decent human being should do. How would you repay him then? The way I see it, he's never been in a relationship. What do I do? I should accept him. Think it through, okay? You might end up repaying good with evil. What? Oh, that doesn't sound too bad. We'll become like Romeo and Juliet. It's thrilling. She's completely crazy. She thinks I have a crush on her. She's delusional and narcissistic. I'm telling you, she belongs in a mental hospital. No. We should have laws that make people like her put up a sign on their heads, so that we can avoid them in advance. Gosh, why did I get involved with her? You said yourself that you felt so sad for her in your dream. No, I didn't. I'm scared. That's right. I saved her because I was scared. No, I did not save her. Okay? Those dreams are nonsense. Don't tell anyone about the dreams. People will think I'm crazy. Sure. As you wish. Who might that be? Huh? It's that woman who lives across the street. What? Hello, I'm Nam Hong-ju. Hi. What brings you here? Oh my. Whose voice is so nice? Let me see your face. I'm curious. -What's with her? -See? She's strange. She's crazy. I can hear you. I made some rice balls. I'm here to give you some. -Listen, Ms. Nam Hong-ju. -Yes? I don't believe what you said about the dreams. So I did not save you, and you don't have any reason to repay me. I'll have to turn down those rice balls. She probably understood what I meant, right? So you don't believe it? I completely understand. {\an8}FLOWERS -Hello. -Bye. Cheep, cheep. -Puppies? -Bark, bark. -Sparrows? -Tweet, tweet. -Chicks? -Cheep, cheep. -Puppies? -Bark, bark. -Sparrows? -Tweet, tweet. Chicks? You'll see a tall guy with long arms. Then... Thank you, Mr. Jeong Jae-chan. Please take the pager and wait for your drink. Welcome. Welcome. A tall guy with long arms will come in here in three minutes. He's wearing a beige coat. When he comes here... -Can I have-- -An Americano with a double shot and hazelnut syrup, right? Yes, that is right. Receiving your card. Please take a step back. You know him? -No. -Yes. -Want me to swap seats? -No. Thank you. It's me. Your neighbor Nam Hong-ju. I know. You must be curious about so many things right now. You thought at first I followed you here, but I was here before you got on, so that's not possible. You'd think it's a coincidence, but something's not right. Right? You even read people's minds? You're right. I followed you here. I saw you going to work in my dream. That a balloon will be caught in a tree. That you'll order an Americano. That you'll go to work by subway today. And that you'll get on this particular train. Seeing the future in the dreams is real. So it's true that you saved me and that I owe you big-time. Right? Why don't you say anything? I came all the way here to hear what you'd say. Oh, right. You'll need this later. I don't believe what you said. You dreamed about me. Why can't you believe me now? It's not that I can't believe you. I'm refusing to believe you. What? I don't want to believe you. Even if I dream those things again, I'll never believe them. I won't care who dies or who lives in my dreams. Why? If I believe them, I'll try to save them. If I fail, it'll be all my fault, and I'll blame myself endlessly. I can't do that. Are you able to handle it? No. If you can't, just ignore the dreams. Just think of them as bad dreams. That's better for your mental health. If you still want to stop them from happening, find another person. You're the only one. I don't know why. But... Keep searching. I'm sure there are more like us. I told you. You're the only one. Dad, I had a weird dream last night. What dream? One, two. Three. You died in my dream. How did I die? Did I bleed a lot? If you saw a lot of blood, it's a good dream. More wrist snap. -Again. One... -Your bus exploded in my dream. Exploded? How? A soldier got on your bus, and he had a rifle and a grenade. Hey, you think we're in the States or something? It's not realistic at all. But it happened in my dream. The grenade exploded in the bus, and all the people in it died. Dad, could you take a day off today? The dream was so real. Really? Then... if you grant my wish, I'll think about it. What wish? Come on. No, I won't ever do that! Why would you say that? It's not even that difficult. You'll need this later. Damn it... Gosh, that stupid weather forecast... Sir, how are you? Oh, hey. Jae-chan. So tell me. Did you bring an umbrella? -No, but I'll go buy-- -Sir. Oh, hey. Ms. Sin. Why did you take the subway today? Well, it's my no-driving day. Did you bring an umbrella? Of course. That's great. I'll take you to the office safely. That sounds great. What should we do, Mr. Jeong? I can't take you too. Oh, it's okay, Hui-min. You two should go. I'm fine. Okay, then. -Let's go, sir. -Okay. By the way, why does he call you by your first name? Maybe because he was my senior back at school. Why does that matter? You're senior to him here now. {\an8}I think he's still clueless. {\an8}You're right. He still has a long way to go. I'm sorry I'm late. {\an8}I didn't expect it'd rain so suddenly. I think you've gone too far this time. Her medical certificate says she has six broken ribs. We've jumped through hoops to intercept the CCTV footage. I know. That's why I pay you guys millions of won per hour. {\an8}I'll talk to the hospital and turn actual bodily harm {\an8}into common assault to make it easier for you. {\an8}Write some letters of apology just in case. You know what you should do after that, right? {\an8}You must get your wife's statement that says she doesn't want you to be punished. {\an8}-So that-- -I won't be indicted because they don't have the right of arraignment. I know. This is not my first time. Will your wife write the statement, though? She's not willing to make me a criminal. So don't worry. She will never do anything that will make So-yun the daughter of a criminal. Right, it must be absurd from Yu-beom's perspective. It's understandable. He's blamed for something he didn't do. And I hugged another guy. It's only natural he's angry. Take it easy. Let's do this decently. And be reasonable. Hi. What would you like to drink? That's okay. I'm not staying for long. I asked you to see me because there's something I wanted to hear from you. Such as... an apology. I know... you're very disappointed... at how I behaved... at the time of the accident. I'm glad you know that. I know that what I'm doing now will look really ridiculous to you. I also know that you did nothing wrong. However, I'll never get a good night's sleep before I break up with you. Wait. Ms. Nam Hong-ju. So, let's end things here. I don't care if you think I'm out of my mind. I'm sorry! Well... do you call this apologizing? Yes! The louder my voice gets, the sorrier I am. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry! I sincerely apologize! -Hi, welcome. -Thanks. Welcome. Be careful. What? Hey, why are... -Why are you here? What about school? -I'm just worried about you. My goodness. If you dream those dreams again, you'd go drop out of school, huh? Dad, I saw that soldier in my dream. It's just a coincidence. Dad, I think he has a rifle in his bag. This just in. An army deserter from Anjin-gun, Gangwon Province, who took a rifle with live ammunition and two grenades, shot a police officer at a convenience store in Munyeong-gu, Seoul and ran away. The military and police are searching for him now. The police officer who was shot died at the scene. Reporter Kim Mu-gyeong will tell us... Why is it raining all of a sudden? Are you coming from the hospital? What? Yes. How is she? Is she all right? I told you, just pretend you didn't see anything. I'm just worried. I won't say anything in front of the others. Never. What is... your name? You don't know my name? We were in the same class last year too. So what? Do I have to know your name? Of course! You're supposed to know your classmates' names. You have to! I didn't know that I have to. Gosh. I shouldn't have given her my coat. What? Have all of them been assigned to me? Then do you think they're for me? Wait. I don't have any space left. You know, why don't you borrow Ms. Sin's cabinet? {\an8}Her office is so prompt that they don't have any unsolved cases left. {\an8}They have plenty of space in their cabinet. I'm prompt too. {\an8}Have you made a reservation for today's lunch? That's your job. {\an8}-I'm doing it now. -Which restaurant? {\an8}Is that important? {\an8}Of course it's important. They say that job is crucial for the performance review of a newbie prosecutor. You've got to be careful when deciding on restaurants for lunch. I'll ask Ms. Sin and decide carefully. You think she'll tell you? Of course. We went to the same school. Hey, Hui-min. Hey, Sin Hui-min. Hey, Ms. Sin. Hello. Hey, come on. OFFICE OF INVESTIGATION OFFICERS I guess her hearing is not good. You should've called her Prosecutor Sin. Don't call her Hui-min, or Sin Hui-min, or Ms. Sin. Call her Prosecutor Sin. You may have graduated before she did, but she's senior to you here. Anyway, why are you calling her so anxiously? I heard she was in charge of reserving restaurants before I came here. I wanted to ask for help. You fool. Memorize what I'm saying. Mr. Park here hates it when meat is in soup. So no seolleongtang or shabu-shabu. Ms. Son doesn't like raw fish. So no sashimi. And Mr. Lee hates to take off his shoes because of his smelly feet. And Hui-min doesn't like Italian food. My goodness. You're giving him those precious tips for free? You're right. I should get paid for them. Hey, how much will you... I'll get going then. What's with him? I think he has some problems with you. I was his private tutor once. I think he thought I was treating him like I treated him back then. But still, how could he... It's okay. I shouldn't have done that. It's my fault. I think he's the deserter on the news. What do we do? If we all die here like in the dream... Don't worry. No one will die here today. A little later, I'll ask all of them to get off, saying there's something wrong with the bus. And then... Oh, boy. I'm so sorry. There's some problem with the tires. I need to repair them. I'm sorry, but you'll need to take another bus. -Are you kidding me? -Come on. -The bus looks fine. -What's this? -Gosh, what a hassle. -I'm so sorry. Other buses will come soon. Those damn tires. -I'm sorry, everyone. -It's pouring rain outside. Such a hassle. Hey, wait! -Hurry up, everyone. Hurry. -What's with you? Hurry! I don't think I can change the tire by myself. Will you help me? Dad! Dad! SEUNG-WON WILL... SEUNG-WON WILL BECOME A MURDERER BECAUSE OF HIS BROTHER Who's Seung-won? Who will he kill? And who's his brother? If you can't, just ignore the dreams. Just think of them as bad dreams. We need to talk. I think he's confessing his feelings to her. -Really? -He's got some balls. Follow me. I told you to pretend you know nothing. I told you not to say anything about it! I saw what you were searching on the internet. {\an8}Why did you look into the penalty for patricide? {\an8}Why did you look for how to buy cyanide and the lethal dose of anti-freeze? What are you thinking? Don't tell me you plan... to kill your father? I plan to save my mom. And I have to get rid of my dad... to save her. Why? You already reported it to the police. The prosecution will bring your father to trial, and he'll go to jail for it. Why do you have to-- What if the prosecution can't do that? Why can't they? He committed a crime. They can't. My dad will never be brought to trial... because the prosecutor's stupid and the lawyer's shrewd. -Oh, hi. -Hello. I've come here as Mr. Park Jun-mo's lawyer today. Park Jun-mo? The guy who beat up his wife? Yes. He's one of my regulars. You know the piano prodigy Park So-yun, right? -He's her dad. -Okay. It's a typical domestic violence case, right? Did you review all the records? Yes. He kicked his wife with his shoes on and broke six of her ribs. So it's actual bodily harm. It's not actual bodily harm. It's common assault. And that shrewd lawyer will turn it into common assault, no matter what. What's the difference between actual bodily harm and common assault? Common assault means no injury. If the person's injured, it's actual bodily harm. But your mom has six broken ribs. So it's actual bodily harm, right? I'm telling you, it's common assault. Isn't this Ms. Do's medical certificate? {\an8}Multiple broken ribs and a contusion. If there's a medical certificate, it's actual bodily harm. Come on, man. Look at the date. The date of the incident is February 14th. And the certificate was issued on February 10th. FEBRUARY 10TH, 2016 Does that mean Mr. Park didn't break his wife's ribs? -Exactly. -Then how did she break her ribs? Here, this is Ms. Do's credit card statement. Look at the items on February 10th. You can see she paid for the ski lift and equipment at Cheongin Resort. Therefore, Mr. Park didn't beat Ms. Do and break her ribs. She broke her ribs while skiing, and that means... Unless something unexpected happens, the shrewd lawyer will manage to turn actual bodily harm into common assault. Let's say it becomes common assault. Then what's the problem? It's still a crime. Yes. It's a crime, but it's absurd. The assailant is punished only if the victim wants him punished. So, if the victim doesn't want the assailant punished, the stupid prosecutor can't do anything about it. And the crime disappears. Then you have to tell your mom to punish him. No, Prosecutor Jeong. I don't want him punished. It's true that I hurt myself while skiing, and it has nothing to do with my husband. As she's always done, she'll tell the prosecutor that she doesn't want him punished. -Yes. -What? Why? Mom is... I'm so sorry for the trouble. She's more scared of my dad than the law. Wow, so this is how it's done. I've been meaning to ask you something since earlier. -What? -You said earlier that Mr. Park is one of your regulars. What kind of director of an academy gets himself into so much trouble that he's your regular? You became a lawyer not long ago. {\an8}Judging by what you're wearing, you're quite an expensive lawyer. {\an8}Why did you accept this case? I was curious. But now I can see why. -So what's your point? -Has it been always like this? You turn actual bodily harm into common assault with a couple of documents and force the victim to write the statement {\an8}to get rid of the right of arraignment. {\an8}You've made him your regular by making his crimes disappear. How many times have you done this? Shouldn't we stop him? Mr. Jeong. I think you've gone too far. This is what I've been worried about. You still hold a grudge against me for what happened 13 years ago. Okay, that's understandable. But you should take it up with me. Why are you taking your anger out on my client? "Taking my anger out"? If not, what's the reason you've done those things to me over the last few days? The way I see it, you're taking your anger out on me. Okay. Firstly, why did you bother my girlfriend, telling her to break up with me? Unbelievable. Secondly, why did you follow me and crash into my car? He crashed into his car? Thirdly... Hey, this case is so obvious. The documents say it all. Why are you picking a fight with such nonsense? That's absurd. The first two have nothing to do with the case. Well... it seems to me those three things come down to one thing. You're taking it out on me. This is crazy. Unbelievable! Mr. Jeong crashed into Mr. Lee's car on purpose. What? Why? I'm not sure. But they mentioned taking his anger out on someone. So I think they have some history. Some history? What history? Apparently, Mr. Jeong stole Mr. Lee's girlfriend. Maybe a love affair? A love affair? That's so messed up. I'm not asking you to do an illegal thing because we know each other. And I'm not asking you to make his crime disappear. I'm asking you to take care of this as the law says. Run it by the chief and have it disposed as no right of arraignment by today. And stop taking it out on my client. As the law says. Okay? I'm leaving then. And please, stop acting like a kid and grow up. You're behaving like a foolish 16 year old. Bye. See you. -Have a good day. -See you. The stupid prosecutor can never save my mom. No one has been able to. There must be another way to save her. The old sayings are all true. When drums beat, laws are... always silent. Hey, Ms. Sin. Here! Ms. Sin! Here! Here. Ms. Sin! You think she can't hear you? Just call her Prosecutor Sin. Hey, Ms. Sin! -Here... -Ms. Sin, here. Oh, you were there. I'm so sorry. The sign was so small, it took me a while to find this place. Okay. Jae-chan, what is your religion? I'm not religious. Well... what's wrong? No, it's nothing. We all have the same religion. So we take turns praying before meals. But don't mind us. You can start eating first. -I see. -Let's pray. -All right. Ji-gwang, you go first today. -Sure. Lord, we thank thee for our daily bread. Please show grace to those who don't believe in you. Please let Jae-chan select restaurants that are easy to find, so that we'll have no problem finding them from now on. I'm working in an organization that has a clear chain of command. Help us always keep in mind that the chain of command is more important than our age. The number of unsolved cases is increasing in our division. Please help us solve them promptly and comfort the victims. Also, please help those who dress inappropriately for work wear something suitable for a prosecutor. This world is full of jealousy and anger. So, we sometimes get carried away by the emotions from our past and don't see cases rationally. Wait, that's-- Even when we're surrounded by anger and grudges, we prosecutors should deal with the cases objectively. Please guide us to the right path. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Okay, let's dig in. Oh, what's wrong? Why didn't you start eating? I've been eating, sir. Here, let me give this to you. -Enjoy the food. -Yes, sir. What are you doing? What does it look like? These are the cases I'll take care of today. Are you sure you can finish all of them today? I will even if I have to pull an all-nighter. I can empty those stupid cabinets in a day. Good, it's the Park Jun-mo case. We have the medical certificate and her statement. So I can request to have it disposed as no right of arraignment. It'll just take about five minutes. All right. Suspect Park Jun-mo. Charged with common assault as I was told. The victim wrote a statement that says she doesn't want the assailant punished. Therefore, no right of arraignment. The end. Wow, it took me less than five minutes. At this rate, I won't have to stay up all night. Okay. Next, unlicensed driving. It'll take me three minutes. Unlicensed driving. What's gotten into him? Is he drunk? I think he's wasted. Then, can we get off work early today? I'm at the funerals of Inspector Jeong Il-song and the bus driver Nam Cheol-du, who sacrificed their lives to save citizens from the armed deserter. Politicians have already requested that these courageous men be designated as men of national merit and that their families receive benefits accordingly. Where's his son? I heard he was on the bus too. I need to interview him. I know. I heard he got the passengers out of the bus. Where's he? The congressman wants to offer a few words of consolation. Mr. Mun, did you take a photo of the congressman offering his condolences? Yes, we did. Right? -Let's go. -Let's go. Hey. He's exhausted. I knew it. He was too enthusiastic. -No! -Oh, my! That startled me. It was so out of the blue. Did you have a nightmare? No, I didn't sleep. I think you're crying right now. No, I'm not. -Wait. -Jae-chan! Get me out of here. It wasn't me. I swear! It wasn't me. Hello? Where are you now? At school. Is everything okay? You're not hurt or in pain, right? No. Why? Never mind. When will you come home? I'm not sure. Around ten? Come straight home after school, okay? Where else would I go? Okay. I plan to save my mom. And I have to get rid of my dad... to save her. Yes, it's just a dream. It's nothing. -Let go of me! -You can't do this. I told you to believe me. If you believed me, we could've stopped it from happening. Gosh. Damn it! And then, you check if all the passengers get off, and tell them to stay as far away as possible from the bus. Let's just run together. Everything's the same as my dream. I'm in charge of this bus. How can I leave the bus and the people to save myself? Dad, please. Hey, think about it. If the catcher avoids the pitch, the ball will hit the umpire and the game will be a mess. I'll let my hair grow long. You said that's your wish. I'll grow my hair, so let's get out of here together. Really? Okay. I'll live to see that later. So you get off first, okay? SEUNG-WON WILL BECOME A MURDERER BECAUSE OF HIS BROTHER But isn't it a daughter? Not a son? I heard the child of Mr. Nam on the bus was a girl, not a boy. -Really? -Yes. Ma'am, where is your daughter? Hong-ju is not in here now. You startled me. Why are you here at this late hour? I'm not here because I changed my mind. I came here to explain why I don't believe what you say. I'm listening. I'm a prosecutor. My job is to punish people after they commit crimes, not stop them before they do. You tell me about your dreams, but there's nothing I can do about them. People die in the dreams, and that's none of my business and not my responsibility. But... But... It feels like you're the catcher, right? A 160km/h baseball is coming toward you, and it's too scary to catch it. But if you avoid the ball, you'll mess up the game. It feels like that, right? Yes. I can't just let it go anymore because I also started having those goddamn dreams. Why the hell is it me? -Why me? -I don't know either. How would I know that? I don't even know why I dream those things. I don't know what it is. But there must be a reason you and I dream these things. I don't know! What if there's a reason? So what? You can't do anything about it and you don't want to believe me. And you're saying it's all my fault? Are you here to say that? Help me. I saw you in my dream. You said that I should've believed you, and Seung-won got into an ambulance or police car and left. I don't know what this dream is about. Seung-won... Who is Seung-won? My little brother. Why? In my dream, Seung-won... killed someone. What? Seung-won. Oh, you memorized my name? He said it was because of his brother. He said that he murdered someone because of his brother. Then he meant you by "his brother"? You... Did you follow me? Yes. Let's go together. I'll take you there. THE LATE NAM CHEOL-DU No way. Is it about Park Jun-mo's case? -It's because of you. -Don't you have any contact lenses? Do I look different without my glasses? Isn't it a closed case? I reopened it. I'll investigate to the end. Why do you hate it when someone gets their hopes up? Because I hate to disappoint someone. It means, "You've got to get it done, or I'll be disappointed." -What do you do, Ms. Nam Hong-ju? -You started taking an interest in me? Are you saying you want to start that?
