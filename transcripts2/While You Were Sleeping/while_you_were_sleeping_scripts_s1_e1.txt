 A TALL MAN I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE {\an8}What's that smell? {\an8}Stop lighting candles. You should ventilate your room instead. {\an8}Who would think a person lives here? It's like a pigsty. I WAS CRYING AND I HUGGED HIM This can't be! What are you talking about? Take a look around you. This is a total pigsty. That's why I can't eat pork. It reminds me of you. No. Hear me out, Mom. I hugged a man I've never seen in my dream. And I hugged him first. Don't you know that I'm not the type to hit on a man first? Of course. How could you hit on a man looking like that? You couldn't if you had an ounce of conscience left in you. Mother. Are you sure you're my mother?

 Please toll the bell for your mother. Here's your Hemingway book. Whatever. How did he look? Was he handsome? That doesn't matter. I have a boyfriend, you know. You only went on two dates, and he's already your boyfriend? Will you get engaged on the third date? I hate seeing two guys at once. So don't try to bring the man in my dream into my life. I won't have to. It will just happen. Whatever you dream about, it always happens in real life. That's not true. I did hear someone was moving in. I guess that was today. Are they brothers? Come on, take this already. Who gives out rice cakes when moving into a new neighborhood? It's lame. It's not lame. It's a way of being a friendly neighbor. -Damn it. -Go now. That's the guy. -The guy I hugged in my dream. -What? Hello. I just moved into the house in front-- Please leave. And don't come to our house like this again. We will not accept any greetings or free stuff. My apologies. Gosh. What the heck? I told you no one would take the rice cake. -You didn't smile, right? -Damn it. I smiled. I really did. I smiled like a fool. Really? It's hard to be that mean. -Was she a woman? -Yes. You should date her. I think you guys will hit it off. You little... Damn. Hey. Mom. You should have told me in advance if you were going to take the car. I'll be late if I take the bus. Mom. That guy is approaching. The guy from my dream. Excuse me. Could you move down a bit? I will not fall for him. -Please? -I'm going to hang up. Stay calm. I'm not interested in that man. Not at all. Why did he sit next to me? Three seats on the left. Three seats on the right. There are a lot of seats. Why did he sit next to me? Is he trying to hit on me? No. Don't jump to conclusions. If I'm full of myself, I'll be humiliated. He moved his seat, too. I didn't jump to conclusions or am full of myself. He moved his seat again. If I let my guard down, I won't be his neighbor, but an acquaintance. And I will become his girlfriend after that. -I'm not interested in you. -There are seats here. You can sit now. What do you mean? -No way. -Hey. She thought he was hitting on her. -Right. -Be quiet. -Totally humiliating. -She can hear us. -What's wrong with her? -What was that? I feel sad for her. Seriously. Excuse me. Cross the street and get on the bus. The next stop is the last one. I know. Can't people get on the bus headed to the last stop? -Did you see that? -I feel bad for her. {\an8}My goodness! {\an8}-She must be humiliated. -I feel bad for her. {\an8}Seriously. That's so embarrassing. We will not accept any greetings or free stuff. My apologies. Her voice... Hey, you! She's that mean girl on the intercom. Damn it. That... It's all right. That wasn't humiliating at all. You did well. That wasn't too bad. -Mom. -Damn it. The dream I had might come true. Did you already fall for that guy? Is it that easy to win your heart? It opens up even before someone has to ask for your heart. It opens up wide. It's not that. That guy fell for me. How do you know that? Why did he sit right next to me out of the blue? You told me that it was to make space for the girls. He's a total player. He's got game. In my opinion, you've got no game whatsoever. I'll pay now. One serving of pork belly and kimchi stew. That's 17,000 won. Okay. Hold on a second. -Here you go. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thanks. Bye. What's wrong? Do you know that guy? I had a dream about three months ago. It was about that guy with the Band-Aid on. It was snowing. And the moment he used his lighter to smoke a cigarette, he caught on fire. When? Where? I don't know about that. He had the Band-Aid on when he was using the lighter. That means it will happen pretty soon. Oh, my. Sir? Excuse me. Can I get your lighter and cigarettes? -Why? -Smoking is bad for your health. You can get cancer-- Why do you care if I smoke or not? Get out of my way. -Sir, if you smoke that, you'll die. -My gosh, have both of you lost your mind? Get out of my way! Move! -Gosh, that hurts. -Gosh. Damn it. Sir, listen to me. If you smoke a cigarette, you'll die. -Give me the benefit of the doubt. Please? -You're ruining my day. -Damn it. -Gosh. It hurts. Hey, I took this away from him. Will this work? Forget it. It'll be useless. It's his choice and his fate. Hey, that's not right. If you know, you should change it. I can't change it. Who would believe my crazy story? -I can tell him I saw him in my dream. -Shit. Where did I put my lighter? I can tell him that my dreams always come true, and that he should listen to me no matter what if he wants to live. But how could someone believe such a crazy story? Even my own father didn't believe me and passed away like that. I can't change the future. I can't change it just because I know. I'd like this cake. And can we also get plenty of firecrackers, please? Is it someone's birthday? Hey, it's the first day of work for Prosecutor Jeong. We must celebrate it. Why would we celebrate his first day of work? That's too much. We should celebrate it. Let's do it. Register today as a national holiday. He does look smart. Right? Prosecutor Jeong looks really smart, doesn't he? I really like him. -Look at his face. -My gosh. I'm so disappointed, Hyang-mi. When we worked together, you seemed to be interested in me. Have you moved on already? My gosh. Prosecutor Lee. I mean, Attorney Lee. I'll pay for these. -No. You didn't have to. -My gosh. It's all right. It's Prosecutor Jeong's first day of work. -I must congratulate him, too. -Do you know Mr. Jeong Jae-chan? Of course. I used to tutor Jae-chan when he was in school. But he doesn't look like he would've needed a private tutor. What are you talking about? He was always ranked last in his school. -Really? -Are you serious? That's surprising. All right. What does this mean? Can you read it? 13 YEARS AGO This is a piece of cake. "Just" means "now." "Ice" means "ice." Together, they are "justice." It means "ice now." No way. He was that stupid? Poor you. If the prosecutor is not bright, it means you'll have a lot of work. Come on. He can't be that dumb. He's a prosecutor. I'm sure he's not that dumb. Gosh. I hate him. Hey, Prosecutor Jeong. Yu-beom? PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, JEONG JAE-CHAN {\an8}JEONG JAE-CHAN What was it, two years ago when I was at the Yeonju Prosecutor's Office, {\an8}I received a commendation from the Prosecutor General {\an8}with the restaurant case and the serial murder case. {\an8}All I did was just follow through on what Mr. Choe set up for me, but I got a commendation for it. Gosh, you're too kind. Hello. I'm an investigator. My name is Choe Dam-dong. Nice to meet you. I'm Jeong Jae-chan. By the way, she's-- I'm a paralegal. My name is Mun Hyang-mi. Nice to meet you. -What brings you here? -What do you think? My student got instated here as a prosecutor. I ought to come and congratulate you. You two used to be a student and a teacher, but now, you meet again as a prosecutor and a lawyer. Is that so? I dropped by to say hello. We can probably help each other out. You know? Win-win. Hold on. Yes. Did you get my text message? I wanted you to free your schedule on the 14th. Why? It's Valentine's Day. There was a restaurant you said you wanted to dine at. I actually know that place. Jae-chan, do you know what "win-win" means? "Win-win"? Is that Chinese? Let me explain what it is. Whenever your ranking goes up by one, your father promised to raise my rate by 10,000 won. Forget about your raise. I'll never be able to bump up my rank. You can fabricate your report card. Come on. My dad is a cop. If he catches me, he'll put both of us in prison. We can raise it little by little so that it's not obvious. If your rank goes up by 30, that's already 300,000 won. I'll give you half. Come on, you said you wanted to buy a motorcycle. When will you save up enough to buy a motorcycle? I'll make more money, and you'll buy a motorcycle. Your father will be happy because your grades went up. It is a win for everybody. This is what's called a win-win. So you have to meet me on Valentine's Day. Okay? Bye. Hey, spare me time someday. I'll take you to an awesome sushi restaurant. See you around. -Bye. -Bye. You're leaving? -Bye. -Bye. So let me get this straight. This means that my mom died because of me. Because of... the accident I caused. Hong-ju. Just tell me that's the truth. Please. Please wake me up. Get a grip, Hong-ju. Oh, no. FEBRUARY 13TH, 2016 AUNT, LONG HAIR, MOM'S WILL {\an8}BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT I CAUSED, MOM... It's expected that five centimeters of snow will pile up today. Hong-ju, eat and take a shower. Please be careful when driving. Hey, why are your eyes so puffy? Did you cry? Pay special attention. No, it's because I ate ramyeon last night. I'll shower. -At a gas station in Seoul... -Shower after you eat. ...a man who lit a cigarette caused a big explosion. {\an8}This is a self-serve gas station in Oseong-dong, Giheung-gu. {\an8}A man who got out of an SUV {\an8}takes out a cigarette, puts it in his mouth, holds the gas nozzle with one hand, and inserts it into the fuel fill inlet. {\an8}And the moment he lights his lighter, {\an8}the oil mist from the inlet catches on fire, {\an8}and the gas station is engulfed in flames in a flash. From this accident, Mr. Kim, a 37-year-old man, died at the scene. Hey, that was the customer from the other day, right? Didn't you tell him not to smoke? Hong-ju. Hong-ju! Let go! Hey. Let go of the scissors! Let go of the scissors. What's wrong with you? Mom, that man died just like in my dream. I know that. But we couldn't do anything about that. It didn't change. Mom, what am I going to do? Mom. Mom, what am I going to do? Mom. Hong-ju. Mom. Because of the accident you cause, I'm going to die? But you don't know when that will be? Look. You should put a flower in your hair like this. -Oh, goodness. -Is this funny? Mom, is this funny to you? You saw the man with the cigarette died just like in my dream. There hasn't been any dreams of mine that turned out differently. Is that why you gave yourself this awful haircut? Did you think it might pan out differently if you cut your hair? I'm never going to grow out my hair. I had long hair in my dream. I had no idea. You only looked pretty because of your hair. Mom! My gosh. Don't worry. I'm not going to die that easily. You're the only family I have in this world. So don't leave me alone in this world. Okay? Goodness, my puppy. You'd look better with the flower. Mom! Your flowers are ready. Thank you. {\an8}FEBRUARY 14TH, 2016 {\an8}What are you doing? Gosh, are you on a date? Hey, Yu-beom. Oh, my. Did you get a new car, too? -What brings you here? -I'm on a date. What about you? I... Me too. -Yu-beom. -Hey, you're here. You got a haircut. What? Do you know each other? Well... By the way, how do you know him? Wait, you two are dating? Yes. Right? We are dating, aren't we? Pardon? Yes. Hey, do you want to join us with your girlfriend? -No. I don't want to. -He can't do that. Never mind, then. Let's go inside. It's cold. Yes. Go inside. -Bye. -Okay. Goodness, you're all grown up. You even have a new car. I'll go inside. Was it when he was in middle school, I got him a motorcycle? Gosh, I think it's been over a decade. Jae-chan is all grown up now. You didn't steal that motorcycle? No, I didn't. I bought it with my own money. I never gave you enough allowance to buy a motorcycle. {\an8}WINTER OF 2003 {\an8}I made the money myself. You "made" money? Where? And how? Sir, let us investigate this case. Why can't you answer me? Did you steal it? No, I didn't. The report cards... Report card? {\an8}REPORT CARD I just fabricated my report cards. Yu-beom told me that you'd raise his rate if my grades went up. And I got half of the raise. Come on. You punk. Why did you fabricate the report cards? Your father bragged a lot when your grades went up. Hey, tell him that you're sorry. But, Dad, this accident... -Sir. -Sir. MOM Is something wrong? You've been checking your phone the whole time. I think I need to go home early today. My mom isn't answering my texts. Is your mom sick? Well, she's not sick. But I just have a bad feeling about it. I blew out the candles. And I definitely turned off the stove. The door... -I forgot to lock the door. -What? I forgot to lock the door. I need to go home. Wait. Hong-ju. Mom, please answer the phone. Hold on, Hong-ju. Have you driven in the snow before? No, I have not. Damn it. What should I do? Should I just take a cab? Can I even get a cab at this time? Give me the key. I'll drive. -But still... -I've driven in the snow a lot. Give me the key. I'll drive. Excuse me. Why isn't she answering her phone? Should I call the police? I'm sure she's fine. Hello? Mom? Why did you call me so many times? No, I forgot my phone at the cafe. That's why I couldn't pick it up. You fool. I answered your call because I got my phone back. A nice man brought it to me. Make sure you have your phone with you. Answer my call whenever I call you. Okay. I'll be home soon. What a relief. Do you always care about your mom that much? No. Yu-beom. If... If I cause an accident, can you look after my mom? What do you mean? What accident? I don't mean right now. I could cause an accident in the future. Okay. No matter what happens, I'll make sure I protect you and your mother. Okay? Are you sure you're okay? You don't seem well. Mom. Mom. Goodness. Doctor. -She woke up! -Mom. -I can't believe this. -My gosh. -Hey. -Gosh. -Are you awake? -Where is... my mom? -She's awake. -Get the doctor. -She opened her eyes. -Goodness. Yu-beom. My gosh. Hong-ju. Ms. Nam Hong-ju. Can you see me? How many fingers am I holding up? {\an8}-My gosh. -It's a Christmas miracle. -That's right. -This is a miracle. Where's Mom? -I can't believe this! -This is great! My hair... Why is my hair... Aunt. What's today's date? Today? It's Christmas Eve. Christmas... has already passed. It passed three months ago. Lady, you've been hospitalized for ten months. Aunt. Where's Mom? Later. I'll tell you once you recover. I'm completely fine. Tell me now. Why couldn't you wake up a bit sooner? Your mother did everything she could just so that she could see you wake up. What do you mean? What happened to Mom? Because of the accident you caused, a man died. My son! Oh, my poor son! Bring him back to life! Bring him back! My baby. You should wake up soon. I'll cook you something delicious. To come up with the settlement money and pay for your medical bills, she sold the house and the restaurant. And she worked day and night without getting a wink of sleep. She did everything she could to save you. And due to fatigue from overwork... She... passed away? Yes, she did. TO MY DEAR DAUGHTER, HONG-JU DEPOSIT IN CHANGSU BANK, 25,000,000 WON, PASSCODE: 3419 FUND IN GONGJIN BANK, 15,000,000 WON PASSCODE: 3419 MYEONGJI LIFE INSURANCE, PASSCODE: 3419 DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF This is a dream. I'm dreaming, right? Please tell me I am. Please? I need to wake up now. Why can't I wake up from it? Please tell me I'm dreaming. Please. Hong-ju. I hate this dream. Aunt. Get a grip, Hong-ju. You might even have to stand trial. What do you mean? Why would I stand trial? I wasn't even driving. Why would I? You weren't driving? Why do you keep saying that I caused the accident? I wasn't driving. I didn't cause the accident! GIYEONG HOSPITAL {\an8}"Interrogating a suspect"? {\an8}What's this about? {\an8}-That lady who woke up after ten months. -Yes. She's being interrogated by the prosecutor here. -In this hospital room? -Hey, here he comes. I guess he's the prosecutor. -Are you her guardian? -No. Ms. Nam. Are you aware that you're being investigated based on Special Cases Concerning the Settlement of Traffic Accidents? You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions partially or completely that may incriminate you. Even if you refuse to answer, it will not be held against you. I can believe you... because it's me. You also have the right to hire an attorney and have the assistance of counsel. Okay. On February 14th, 2016, you were driving the car registered under your mom's name home. You crashed into Han U-tak, who was crossing the street at the crosswalk at the intersection in Sanggu-dong. Is that correct? I wasn't driving. Mr. Lee Yu-beom, who got in the car with me, drove. Yes. That's the statement you made to the detective. Yes, but the detective didn't believe me. That's why I called in Mr. Lee and interrogated him as well. What did he say? When I asked him if he had driven that day... That's what I regret the most. I should have driven for her. I tried to stop her. I said it was slippery and dangerous because of the snow. But she said she had to hurry back because she couldn't reach her mom. I just couldn't let her go by herself. So I got in the car with her because I was worried. That's a lie. He's lying. I clearly remember. He was the one who drove the car that day! We tested the bloodstain on the airbag of the driver's seat. I found your DNA, Ms. Nam. This can't be. From the ambulance's dashcam footage, you were rescued from the driver's seat. And Mr. Lee was rescued from the passenger seat. I swear. I was not driving! Then, how can you explain the DNA and the dashcam footage? Someone probably fabricated it. Hong-ju! When the accident happened, I was unconscious. Someone must have moved me to the driver's seat. And he must have wiped his blood off the airbag and stained it with my blood. Then, he probably went to the passenger seat. By "someone," are you implying that-- It's probably Yu-beom. He probably pinned this on me, so he could walk away a free man. You think he pinned it on you. That's only speculation. We believe evidence over speculation. Unfortunately, the evidence is working against you. Then, what should I do? There's nothing I can do. All the evidence is pointing toward you. It's better to admit your offense. That way, we can consider being lenient toward you. Even when I didn't cause the accident? The bereaved family wants the driver to be punished. If you keep denying the offense, it won't be favorable in weighing your offense. LEE YU-BEOM If something happens to you because of what I did, I don't think I'll be able to live. You're the only family I have in this world. So don't leave me alone in this world. Okay? Ms. Nam. What are you doing? Don't come any closer! -If you come any closer, I'll jump. -Come down over here. Come down, and let's talk this over. If I do, what difference will it make? I already told you. I told you it snowed on Valentine's Day. So Yu-beom drove for me! And a man died. Yu-beom made me the driver! No one believes me, no matter what I say. Talking about it is pointless. I'll believe you. I will. I'll believe you. Come over here. How great would it be... if this was just a dream? What if this was your dream? Thank you... for saying that you'll believe me. Ms. Nam. No! No! Jeez. How can a dream... feel so real? FEBRUARY 14TH, 2016 Holy shit! Are you up? Gosh, what are you doing? You scared me. Why did you get up so early? I just had a weird dream. A very unpleasant dream that felt creepily real. What was the dream about? That woman from across the street was in my dream. I knew it the moment you said she was mean. That's how a typical romantic comedy begins. And she was in your dream. The story is going well. What was the genre of your dream? Romantic comedy? Passionate love story? Or was it rated-R? She died in my dream. What? No! What? That's a thriller. Yes. It was a thriller dream that felt extremely real. Real, my ass. You said she died in your dream. But she's fine. What a relief. Why was Yu-beom in your dream? That's so random. I ran into him recently. You let him leave? You should've punched him. I just said hello to him, smiling like a fool. If I were you, I would've cursed at him and spat phlegm on his face. In your dream, Yu-beom and the woman across the street were dating? Well, they met on Valentine's Day, so I think so. That dream doesn't mean anything. You just had a crazy dream with two of the people you hate the most. What's today's date? It's February 14th. It's Valentine's Day. You're getting your new car today. While couples are having a great time, we'll take out your car on a test drive like a couple of losers. -Do you have any other plans? -Yes. Cancel them. I'll kill you if you're late. Damn it! What's your deal? There are other seats. Why are you sitting next to me? Excuse me. I have a question. For me? Do you know a guy named Lee Yu-beom? How do you know that? You're stalking me, aren't you? You did a background check on me, so you can make a move on me, right? Wait, you know Lee Yu-beom? -Taxi. -Wait. You're meeting him later, right? Stop that. If you keep hitting on me, I'll scream. I know that I sound crazy right now, but just hear me out. Don't meet him tonight. It'll snow today, so don't drive. Don't even get close to a car. Okay? Hey. Did you hear me? Hey. Are you all right? He's a total stalker. Why does he care if I drive or not? That's so annoying. Why do you care if I smoke or not? Sir, is it going to snow today? No. It's going to be a sunny day. Thank you. Bye. Hey, do you know what time it is? It's-- -Hey, Yu-beom. -What? Gosh, are you also on a date? Oh, my. Did you get a new car, too? What brings you here? I'm on a date. With Ms. Nam? Yu-beom. Yu-beom, you said the other day that you'd buy me sushi. Buy me sushi today. Gosh, I can't do that today. I have plans today. I don't have plans today. Buy me sushi today. What's wrong with you? Today is Valentine's Day. That's why... I'm really craving sushi right now. If I eat sushi alone on Valentine's Day, it'd look weird. If two men eat sushi together on a day like this, it'd look weirder. What are you doing here? You're here. I told you earlier that you should stay home tonight. Why do I have to? Tell me your reason. -It's-- -Hold on. Am I the only one who doesn't know what's going on here? Let's go inside, Hong-ju. Hey. Let's talk about this some other day in private. Let's go. Sorry I'm late. Gosh, what a beautiful car. Did you get the complete package with all the features? Look at this. Jae-chan. One of my friends has a piano recital today. Want to come? Sure. Let's go. I'll stop being nosy and just go. What? They didn't say anything about snow today. I told you it snowed on Valentine's Day. Hey, I'll probably sound like a madman. But I think my dream is coming true. That thriller dream you had this morning? -Yes. -You're right. You do sound like a madman. Let's just go. Let me just check one more thing. Just one more thing. It's going to start soon. I forgot to lock the door. I forgot to lock the door. I need to go home. That was true. Yu-beom really was the one who drove. Yu-beom. Ms. Nam! Stop right there. Jae-chan, what's going on? Call the police right now. Tell them there will be an accident later. Tell them to stop Vehicle Number 4773. You've gone mad! What am I going to say to the police? Do I tell them my brother had a dream and there will be an accident later? This is driving me nuts. Jae-chan, you're acting really weird. Why do you care so much about her? I don't care about her. It's just... She might go through what I went through. She might take the blame without being able to clear her name. Meeting Yu-beom must have really stressed you out. That must be why you had that nightmare. Come on. Let's go. Let's forget about them. If I keep going down this road, I'll really be a madman. Damn it! Jae-chan, I didn't get in yet. Jae-chan! How could you go without me? What accident? What do you mean? I don't mean right now. I could cause an accident in the future. I'll be okay. Please look after my mom. Okay. No matter what happens, I'll make sure I protect you and your mother. Okay? By the way, what happened between you and Jae-chan? Earlier, it seemed you and Jae-chan-- Are you all right? Are you hurt? Are you all right? Yes. Jae-chan. Did you just crash into us? Yes. The wheels must have slipped in the snow. You crashed... into us on purpose, didn't you? No. The wheels slipped in the snow. -I'm sorry. -Hey. Hey! Do you think I didn't see that? It happened because you followed us. It is obvious that you caused this accident on purpose. Don't you dare give me your ridiculous excuse. -It's not what you think. -It's not? Then, what is it? Why did you do that, then? Do you need money? Is this for an insurance claim? You could have killed someone if it weren't for me. You're out of your mind. You've gone mad. Are you doing this because of that motorcycle accident? Yu-beom, what should I do? The police are coming. Shit. If the police come, they'll find out I bought a motorcycle. When the police come, you must beg for forgiveness. Say that you're sorry and you'll compensate for the damage. What are you talking about? You drove the motorcycle. Why would I pay for this? Tell them you drove it. That sounds more plausible. Are you making me lie? No, Jae-chan. I want our story to make sense. Let's face it. Accidents like this... Someone like you would have caused it, not me. This makes no sense! You were the one who caused it! I'm going to tell the truth when the police get here. Is that so? MOCK TESTS ON CRIMINAL LAW I'll say that you drove it. -Yu-beom! -There's no eyewitness. And it's just the two of us here. I'm curious... which one of us... the police will believe. I almost killed a man? I can take only so much of your bullshit. Jae-chan, you are out of your mind. Do you know that? No. I'm completely sane. Had I not stopped you, you would have killed that guy. And knowing your character, you would have fabricated the accident and framed it on her. You lunatic. Enough is enough! She would have become a murderer who killed a man because of you. And her mother would have died from the shock. And that woman... would have taken her own life because of the false accusation. I know... that you are more than capable of doing what I just said. You haven't changed. You're blaming other people and coming up with a pathetic excuse. You almost killed us. No. I was trying to save you. Who would believe that? Hong-ju. Can you believe what this lunatic is saying? I get it. Who would believe me... if I say that I saw you in my dream? And that you looked so sad in my dream, so I came all the way here to change that dream. No one would believe... that I changed the future. I... believe you. I can believe you... because it's me. Thank you. Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son
