 {\an8}That moment was like a gift. {\an8}I was even grateful {\an8}for all the decisions that led up to this moment. {\an8}All the decisions that seemed foolish were wise in the end. {\an8}And even the decisions I regretted... were right in the end. {\an8}Just like that, everything made my heart flutter and was beautiful. And I was relieved... about everything.

 But there was just one thing. {\an8}Do you think he's doing well? What? {\an8}Remember the guy at the reservoir? {\an8}The police officer was trying to end his life there. I remember him from time to time. And I worry about him, too. Don't worry about him. He's doing well. Really? How do you know that? Where does he live? That man sent us money again. I don't know where he lives or what his name is. But I know for sure that he's alive. So you don't need to worry about him.

 That's a relief. That's all I need to know. I just need to know he's alive. "What though life conspire to cheat you, do not sorrow or complain. Hearts live in the coming day. There's an end to passing sorrow. Suddenly all flies away, {\an8}and delight... {\an8}returns tomorrow." {\an8}13 YEARS AGO {\an8}Gosh, what a nice poem. Jesus Christ! You startled me. Sir, I'm hungry. I want to eat. Okay. I'll get you some food right now. You're not going to try anything stupid, right? I won't go anywhere. And I won't do anything stupid. My life... doesn't end now. I need to meet someone... in the distant future. Will we be able to recognize him if we meet again? We didn't even recognize each other. Won't it be the same with him? Right. We might not have recognized him even when we've already met. Why? Do you want to meet him? Yes. What about you? Me too. But do you think he would want to meet us? I'm not sure. When we met him in the future, he told us... that he thought about meeting us more often... and more desperately... than we thought about meeting him. But we couldn't recognize him for a long time... when he came to meet us after waiting for a very long time. And small incidents... that were scattered around like small waves... came together one at a time and approached us slowly, while creating a big wave... which... paved the way to him. You're not having a funeral? No one would come anyway. What are you wearing? I didn't have any black outfits, so I just wore my brother's suit. My brother has long arms and legs for no good reason. Right. He did have long arms and legs for no good reason. Have you seen my brother? I went to your brother's trial. Really? Yes. He crushed the defense counsel, saying that justice is a river or whatnot. It felt good to watch. And I was grateful, too. Grateful? Why are you grateful? The defense counsel... was the one responsible for my dad's death. Who was it? Prosecutor Lee Yu-beom. No. Now, he's a lawyer. Do you get more money if you check it again? -Hello. -Lawyer Lee. Today is my payday, but why do I have such a low balance? It feels like it takes ages to get paid, but when they take money from us, they are fast. Right. Why don't you two work at my law firm? I'll make you feel like you're getting paid at lightning speed. Really? I'll try to match the annual salary you tell me. And I'll guarantee your job until retirement and you'll get off work on time, too. I'm in. I'd love to. What about you, Mr. Choi? Well, I told you my answer that day. I don't want to. I want to! I totally want to! On one condition, Hyang-mi. Convince Mr. Choi to work at my law firm with us. I'll wait for you, Mr. Choi. What kind of condition is that? Am I a bonus? A freebie? Buy one, get one free? Hyang-mi. Keep Lawyer Lee's offer a secret from Prosecutor Jeong. Don't tell anyone. I'm so disappointed. Do you think I have a big mouth? Don't you know me? Yu-beom is trying to poach Mr. Choi? Yes. He said he'd match whatever annual salary Mr. Choi wants. He was trying to convince Mr. Choi. He was determined. My gosh, Mr. Choi works with a sense of duty. Money won't convince him to move. Of course it can. It's very possible. His job is secured until he retires. And he'll get a separate office, facing south. And he'll get a corporate credit card. If he's in his right mind, he'd quit right away. But I bet Mr. Choi likes working with me more than working with Yu-beom. He doesn't like working with you. You're frustrating and slow. You're like a groundhog who always digs into cases. And you make him work overtime and go to the crime scenes. I feel so bad for Mr. Choi that it makes me tear up. So what do you want me to do? Why are you telling me that? Appreciate him while you have him. You should butter him up and put on some cute acts here and there. And give him some presents, too. Forget it. If I need to do those things to make him work here against his will, I will not work with him. See you inside. It didn't work. Damn it. Gosh, why is this box empty? Thank you. I heard everything from Hyang-mi. Yu-beom offered you a job. Hyang-mi, you already told him? How could you bring that up right away? I think working for him is the right thing to do if the conditions are better. I see. Hold on. What? My gosh, no. I'll do it. -I will do it. -Don't move. I don't want to hold you here against your will. I can't lie to you and make a promise that I'll do better... when I can't keep it. The decision is completely up to you. Even if you choose to leave, I won't resent you. What? Make a V. Don't mind me or feel bad for me. Take your time and make your decision. Okay. WITH MY MENTOR {\an8}PROSECUTOR JEONG JAE-CHAN Let's come up with a novel idea for the Three-Day Experience. Don't suggest easy themes like sea-fishing or picking grapes at the farm. Suggest some novel ideas. How about the experience of a pregnant woman who's due soon? In fact, this costume was designed to make you feel just like how a pregnant woman feels at eight months. With this costume on, for three days, we can change our shoes and take the subway to experience what it's like to be a pregnant woman. We can point out the ways we can be considerate for pregnant women. Okay. Let's keep it. Any other ideas? How about three days at the prosecutors' office? We don't have a lot of chances to observe the daily lives of prosecutors. That's a good idea, but we can't. No prosecutors will agree to this. They won't let us film because the investigations are confidential, they need to protect the suspects' rights and whatnot. No, I can get them to agree. The chief prosecutor at Hangang District Office is press-friendly. I met him on a golf course a few days ago and explained to him about my idea. And I got a positive response from him. You should have started with that. Let's keep this, too. Du-hyeon, isn't it more meaningful for a man to go three days as a pregnant woman than for a woman to do so? Right. Men who can't relate to being pregnant need to wear the costume to make the segment meaningful. Okay. Hong-ju will observe prosecutors at their office for three days. And Du-hyeon will experience pregnancy for three days. Okay. What? Why me? We have a lot of newbies here for that. You just said so yourself. It's meaningful if a guy does it. Since you understand the concept the most, you should do it. Captain. You look great, sir. Sir, you're my role model. What a bummer. You'll steal Reporter of the Year from me again this year. Oh, no. I think I'm going to have a lot of work at the prosecutors' office. Hey! The prosecutors' office... Being pregnant is a million times harder! I knew it. Du-hyeon understands the hardships of pregnant women the best. I'll really look forward to your segment. Give him a round of applause! You can do it! -You have my respect. -You're all mad. -You look good. -Win that award! Damn it. INVESTIGATOR CHOI DAM-DONG Mr. Choi, can't you not work for Yu-beom? That's a double negative. It sounds confusing. Don't leave. Does that sound too rude? Don't go. Will you go? Don't go. Don't go... Jae-chan. What is it? Don't go to Yu-beom. Damn it. This is bad! I sent the text message. What is it? I sounded so rude and demanding to Mr. Choi. What should I do? Damn it. What did he say? I won't go. Hey, he's not going! He's not going! He won't go! I love you, Mr. Choi. What? What is it? What did Dae-gu see in you to give you this? What is this? I have a friend named Myeong Dae-gu. He asked me to give this to you. Myeong Dae-gu? This looks like a suicide note. Yes. The serial murderer who killed people with IV drips committed suicide in prison a while ago. It's his suicide note. How do you have this? That guy is Dae-gu's father. Dae-gu wanted you to take a look at this. Me? Why? He said that his father might have died when he was innocent. He wants you to help him clear his name. Hey, everyone who goes to prison says that they are innocent. They all say they are wronged. But still, just read it. When I read it, something didn't feel right. And even more so... because Yu-beom was the prosecutor in charge. With this case, Yu-beom even won an award from the Prosecutor General. I USED TO BE A DOCTOR WHO SAVED PATIENTS' LIVES BUT I'VE NOW BECOME A MURDERER WHO KILLED THOSE PATIENTS. I HOPE MY SON WILL UNDERSTAND MY DECISION AND FORGIVE ME. I AM INNOCENT. At the Yeonju Prosecutors' Office, I received a commendation from the Prosecutor General with the restaurant case and the serial murder case. All I did was just follow through on what Mr. Choi set up for me, but I even got a commendation for it. Gosh, you're too kind. Should we go in now? Later. We'll get them when he makes contact with the fence. POWER OFF PLEASE RETURN MY CELLPHONE. I'LL GIVE YOU A BIG REWARD. REWARD IS FIVE MILLION WON. I WILL NEVER REPORT YOU TO THE POLICE. I'LL GIVE YOU TEN MILLION WON. MEET ME TOMORROW AT 1 P.M. UNDER CHEONGIL UNDERPASS. Ten million won? What's in this phone? Why would someone pay ten million won for it? There you go. Jae-chan. You think that police officer might have dreams about our future? Yes. U-tak and I talked about how these dreams all started a while ago. According to the rule, the police officer should dream about us. Rule? What rule? The rule is that you dream about the person who saved you from death. I usually dream about Jae-chan. And Jae-chan usually dreams about Hong-ju. Is that so? When I first heard about it, I thought it made no sense because I had no idea that you were Chestnut. But it all makes sense because you're Chestnut. You saved me from the reservoir 13 years ago. And I saved U-tak from the car accident. That does make sense. But why do we have dreams? When I almost died in the car accident, this crossed my mind. "I really almost died. I want to repay the person who saved me." Because of that thought, my dreams started. The dreams that show the future of the person that saved me. What do you think? Doesn't it make sense? It does. ON THE MATTRESS... Since we saved the police officer from the reservoir, according to the rule, {\an8}he could also see our future in his dream? {\an8}JEONG JAE-CHAN AND NAM HONG-JU DIE! -Right. -Then, he must know both of your faces and where you live. Well... probably. No. I thought about it, but it makes no sense. He would have come to see us if that rule was true. You think he'd want to see you? It's not like you met at a happy occasion. It will only hurt each other's feelings if you meet. Is that so? What is it? What? It's nothing. Right. I'll be going to your department to do my news coverage starting today. -For three days. -Why? You're coming to our department? For three days? Oh, that? Is it for the Three-Day Experience? That segment is fun. Then, you'll be seeing Prosecutor Jeong at his office? Hey, you! The fault is with you! Are you a secret inspector or something? -Oh, no! -Gosh. Gosh. Are you okay? You did that on purpose! He's the groundhog of Criminal Department Three. I almost forgot. This is why no one is welcoming him back. Damn it. I think I'll be glued to you for three days. To me? The chief prosecutor selected the most competent and good-looking prosecutor in your department as my source. It is Jae-chan if it's the most competent and good-looking prosecutor. Would that be me? Nice to meet you. My name is Sin Hui-min. We've met before, right? I'm Nam Hong-ju of SBC News. I hope we can work well together. Ms. Sin. Please help Ms. Nam to record the candid side of the prosecution. Okay? Yes, sir. Don't worry. Follow me. Have a good day. Goodness. All right. She's close to Rookie. You should've assigned Rookie to her. -Why did you choose her? -I know. I guess you only say that you cherish Mr. Jeong. Mr. Jeong, isn't this disappointing? No, I'm okay. Gosh, you guys are so clueless. I didn't assign her to him because I cherish him. They are crazy about each other right now. Imagine that she observes him for three days. Her romantic fantasy about him will be shattered and she'll be disappointed. Why would that happen? What's so bad about Mr. Jeong? Which one of us has the most unsolved cases in our department? Mr. Jeong. Which one of us has the most typos in our reports? Mr. Jeong. And which one of us takes a month to submit his report on a simple theft case when others take a week to finish? Mr. Jeong. Then, will her fantasy be shattered or not? It will be shattered. Should you be grateful to me or not? -Thank you. -My gosh. Mr. Jeong, let's do better. Okay? Okay. {\an8}PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE: PROSECUTOR SIN HUI-MIN You scammed cancer patients by telling them that the bellflower root powder is a cure for every disease, correct? "Bellflower root"? I don't speak good Korean. I'm a very good person. I'm a good person. I mean, ma'am, I swear, I really sold it out of the goodness of my heart. I swear. Okay? That's no excuse for a violation of the law. I really didn't know that it was against the law. If I knew about it, I'd be happy to face my punishment. If you're happy to face it, it's not a punishment. It'd be candy. You'll be punished, so you suffer. Just accept it. Cool. You should be relieved that Prosecutor Sin is a woman. If she were a man, Ms. Nam would have fallen for her. Yes, probably. Hey, keep your chin up. I'll let you borrow my car whenever you want. -Really? -Yes. Thank you, sir. You're the best. If you are really grateful, can you swap the night duty shift with me? Sure. Do you have plans tonight? Yes. With whom? You know... Bye. -Bye. -Who? You know. We can go on a date today. INTERROGATION AND OBSERVATION ROOM Perfect timing. -Come on in. Take a seat. -Okay. Thank you. Both of you. -What? -For what? For staying with me when I'm lacking in many areas. What's gotten into him? Mr. Choi. I won't go. I won't leave. I'll stay by your side. And I'll retire here. Stop bringing that up now. If you continue, you'll give me goosebumps and I'll become a goose. It's not that. Do you know a man named Myeong I-seok? Myeong I-seok? I've heard of that guy. He's the notorious IV Drip Serial Killer. He committed suicide a while ago. Yu-beom was the prosecutor on his case at Yeonju District Prosecutors' Office. -Did you investigate the case with him? -Yes, I did. Why do you ask? I came across his suicide note and petitions. When I read them, some parts bothered me. It was a clean case. When you listen to the criminals, their stories sound convincing. They feel wronged. And, of course, we feel bad. But if you fall for their tricks, you'll be in serious trouble. Okay. Being punctual is the key in direct dealing. Wait, am I being scammed right now? Did you bring the cellphone? The money? What's inside that phone? Why would you pay ten million won for that? What is this? Were you being tailed? -Shit. -Damn it. -Hey! -Go after the fence. -Yes, sir. -Damn it! Hey! Stop right there! Hey! You know the gukbap restaurant nearby? That restaurant was on Meal Perfectionist. Do you want to check it out? The light is green. They're fully charged. -Sir. -Yes? By any chance... Wait. Isn't that Detective Go? Yes, it is. Where is he going? Hey! Detective Go, what's going on? -The gray shirt... -The gray shirt? He bought a stolen cellphone. What? Gray... Gray... Hey, U-tak. It's the man in checkered pants. I'm Lieutenant Han of Sanggu Patrol Division. Please stop. Hey, let go of me. I'm a victim. Why would a victim run away? -I ran because you were chasing me. -Let's talk at the station. Let go of me! Is it necessary for you to record the prosecutor during the night duty? You have two more days left. I want to get off work, too. But my captain told me to record prosecutors for 24 hours. What choice do I have? I need to follow my orders. What else can I do? -Prosecutor Son. -Hi. Who's on the night duty today? It was supposed to be Mr. Lee, but he switched with Mr. Jeong. Why did he switch... with Rookie? Hey, can you take over the night duty today? I have a prior engagement. Then, what about Prosecutor Sin? I heard that she also had plans. Just trust him and let him handle it. Mr. Jeong is working hard. Of course, I know that. That's all he's been doing day and night. What? She'll record me during my night duty? Wait, no. It's... Okay. I got it. Okay. Damn it. This is bad. Is someone coming to the office? We're done questioning people for the day. She's going to come and record me during my night shift. Hyang-mi, can you hide these case files in Prosecutor Lee's office? -Why? -Gosh, it looks like I have a lot of unsolved cases. And it makes me look incompetent. You should just be yourself. Be yourself. If I do that, I would humiliate the organization. So he knows that. I didn't wash this once. Gosh, this is bad. Mr. Choi, she won't be able to record the smell, right? Thanks for the candid snippet of your day, Prosecutor Jeong. I guess we're going to be on TV. Goodness. Oh, Lord. Why on earth did you meet Park Dae-yeong? I told you already. The person who lost the phone begged me to find the phone. So I went there on behalf of that person. -Actually, I'm a victim in all of this. -What about the ten million won? I guess it was worth that much money to that person. You know? You know there are phones with a lot of valuable memories and stuff. Why did you throw away the phone in the river if it was that valuable? It wasn't even yours. I didn't throw it away. My hands slipped, so it fell. There's definitely something on the phone. Don't you think so? Right. Something unbelievably suspicious must be on the phone. What could it be? We can't even find it since he threw it in the river. Damn it. This is so frustrating. You know? Park Dae-yeong, why don't you talk to the prosecutor via video call? No, I don't want to do it via video call. I'd like to meet the prosecutor in person. I want to meet the prosecutor in person. Chief, aren't you going home? What? Don't mind me. Just pretend I'm not here. Just keep working. Keep filming him. Pretend I'm not here. -Okay. -I'll be outside. -Good luck. -Okay. Thanks. What's the main task of the prosecutor on night duty? We mainly handle the requests for arrest warrants from the police and decide whether to detain suspects or not. Excuse me. This is Jeong Jae-chan of Seoul Hangang District Prosecutors' Office. Yes, right now? Goodness. Oh, Lord. Is someone coming here? Yes, please come up. Yes. Right. What's the name of the prosecutor? I hope he's lenient. -Goodness. -No? That's the office. He habitually steals cellphones. The police requested an arrest warrant because there's a possibility he might flee or destroy evidence. Wait... Where have I seen him? Usually, I question the suspect via phone call or video call. But he's coming here because he insisted on talking to me in person. After questioning him here, you decide whether to issue the warrant or not, correct? -Correct. -Sir. -Okay. -Sit there. All right. You can sit right here. You wanted to see me in person? Yes. {\an8}ARREST WARRANT REQUEST ON PARK DAE-YEONG FOR THEFT You have the same name as my chief prosecutor. Park Dae-yeong? Oh, right. The guy who dirtied my name. I'm not sure if you'll believe me. I used to be a civil servant who got paid through taxpayers' money. When my younger sibling caused trouble, I used up all of my savings to take care of it. And my wife left, too. And my only daughter got into a car accident at the age of nine... and hurt her back. She can't even drink water without my help. Then, is your daughter by herself at home? Goodness. He's falling for that. In Korea, it's impossible to hold down a job... and take care of my daughter. That's why I stole it. I know that I have committed a grave crime. I will cooperate with your investigation, stand trial, and do everything you ask of me. Just... please don't put me in jail. My daughter, Ju-gyeong, might die without me. Ju-gyeong is probably waiting for hotteok I was supposed to bring to her and folding paper cranes right now. She believes... if she folds ten thousand paper cranes... If she folds ten thousand paper cranes, she thinks she can walk. Isn't that correct? Jeez. Even after ten years, your repertoire hasn't changed. This is all a lie. Don't fall for it. Issue an arrest warrant for this guy. Sir, do you know this man? I know him very well. You bastard, ten years ago-- Chief, she's filming this. Reporter Nam, cut this part out. This man here committed the same crime ten years ago. So I issued an arrest warrant for him. Just issue the warrant. Is your daughter really alone at home? Yes. She's alone. Mr. Jeong. What are you doing? Don't be an amateur. Can't you tell that he's lying to you? Ten years ago, he said he had a nine-year-old daughter. So does his daughter never age? Is she immortal? I'm not just going to release him. I just want to go to his house and check. Goodness, this would've taken five minutes. Why are you trying to waste two hours on this? You're acting just like an unqualified doctor. The ER is full of patients from a car crash, and they are all dying. But you're like a doctor who's spending hours trying to put a Band-Aid on a patient who skinned his leg. Your office is full of unsolved cases because you fall for obvious lies from suspects and keep investigating cases. Stop talking back to me and issue the arrest warrant. Goodness. Unbelievable. INTERROGATION AND OBSERVATION ROOM Are you all right? I'm okay. Prosecutor Jeong doesn't get scolded like this all the time. How should I put it? This rarely happens, so don't be disappointed in him. Mr. Choi. Yes? If someone fools you, does it mean you should be scolded? I don't think believing someone is such a bad thing. Running after that guy is already making me hungry. Do you want to order fried chicken? Sir. You know, don't you? -Know what? -You know... that I can't tell colors apart. Yes. I know. Why didn't you say anything? That's a reason for termination. Did you lie about that? No, it was a testing error. That's all right, then. Once you're in, that's it. I just need to keep my mouth shut. That's it. But still... Who caught the guy who was running away today? Was it me or you? I know it's hard to believe, but my stomach right here... should be considered a reason for termination, not your eyes. How could I call myself a cop when I run so slowly? That's it. Today, I won't eat fried chicken. Let's go in. Salute. {\an8}EUNJI'S HONEY HOTTEOK -Ma'am. -Yes? Give me 2,000 won's worth of hotteok. Okay, sure. Is anyone inside? Hey, kid. Are you home? How can I help you? Hello. Do you know the man who lives here? The man who lives in the studio? Of course. -He always gets kimchi from me. -Then, do you know about his daughter? His daughter? I think you might have the wrong house. He lives alone. I really thought he was telling me the truth. This is weird. Why did he lie to me? Damn it. The chief is going to crush me. This is driving me crazy. What? How did you know I was here? -You dreamed about me, didn't you? -No. I don't need to dream this. I can read you like a book now. I just had a feeling you would be here. Do you want some? -No, I don't want to. -It's so sweet. I don't have an appetite. He doesn't have a daughter, right? He lied, didn't he? Yes. I was pathetic today, wasn't I? I fell for the suspect's lie and got an earful from the chief. Please edit my part out. It's a disgrace to my department. I asked the hotteok seller. He did have a daughter... ten years ago. A nine-year-old daughter who hurt her back in a car accident. He couldn't look after his daughter while working as a mailman. So he quit his job and started to steal cellphones. And he got arrested. His daughter was all alone when she was rescued, but she passed away while he was in prison. Ever since then, he's been alone. If he met a prosecutor like you and not your chief prosecutor ten years ago, his daughter would have been alive. And as for this, don't worry about it. I'll edit all of your parts and watch it by myself. If this airs on TV, every woman in Korea will have a crush on you and chase you, and I can't stand that. My gosh, it is really sweet. Give me one. What? Okay. Here. -You're wearing the ring. -What? You saw that just now? You're not sharp at all. Thank you. It doesn't matter if the beer only costs 2,500 won. If you're a repeat offender, they won't be lenient. You'll have to face short-term imprisonment. -That's true. -What are you talking about? -I swear. You'll have to. -Mr. Park Dae-yeong. Who is that guy? Sir, what's going to happen to me? Will I be able to go to my daughter? No, I already issued your arrest warrant. I'll question you before your arrest today. This is a bust. I thought you'd be different. I guess you're not. I went to your house last night. My house? Your daughter wasn't at home. Is that why you issued the arrest warrant? Because what I did was reprehensible? I heard what happened to your daughter ten years ago. We should have taken care of her when you were arrested, but we failed to do that. I know that it's pointless to apologize on their behalf now. But let me give you my apologies. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. I told the story about my daughter... and cried in front of six prosecutors. But you were the only one who actually went to my house. You know what? I should give you... a reward. What's this? I don't know what it is, but something really important is in there. What's that? How would I know that? You need to figure it out now. These photos were in a ten-million-won cellphone? Yes. The owner of the phone was willing to pay ten million won to get it back. I'm sure there has to be information that's worth more than ten million won. He deceived you, and you fell for it again. You always fall for people's lies. Every day is April Fool's for you. Who knows? If I do find something, I'll be able to propose an investigation, right? Do you think you can start investigating because you propose it? The process is really complicated. Don't try to put more stuff on your plate than you need. You should try to close the cases you have now. What is this? I only see photos of puppies and food. What am I supposed to find in here? Could it be a trade secret? It could be an industrial spy. Hey, you can't film this. -You can't. No, you can't. -You're not investigating yet. Let me see. You can't film this. No. Film Hyang-mi. Hyang-mi looks pretty today. Aren't you here to film Prosecutor Sin Hui-min? What are you doing here? Get a close-up. -Zoom in. -Don't film me. Hyang-mi. Look. What is it, Mr. Choi? These are photos of patients. Is the owner of the phone a doctor? What? Do you recognize anyone? These are victims. Victims? Victims of what? The IV drip serial murder case. What? What? Don't worry. How can they find a cellphone that fell in the Han River? Don't worry about the police. I told them that I didn't know you. Yes, it's fine. Wait, why were the photos of the victims on the phone? Did the phone belong to Myeong I-seok? It can't be. It's been over a year since he went to prison. How many photos of victims are there? There are 19. Were there 19 victims in the serial murder case? No, there were only 11. Then, what about the other eight victims? I'm getting scared. The other eight victims must be alive, right? What is this? Does it mean Myeong I-seok had an accomplice? Or was the real culprit someone else? We need to meet with the owner of the cellphone first. Don't sweat it. Why would they look for me? Well, there's no reason to look for me. I didn't do anything wrong. Why would they-- What? You were here? Why would you check what was inside a stolen cellphone? You should try to close unsolved cases instead of wasting your time on this. It's not a waste of time. The reward for the phone was ten million won. There were photos of victims of serial murder -on the phone. -Wait. One person took all of those photos before the victims died. That person could be an accomplice or the real culprit. Didn't the thief from yesterday give you the data on the stolen phone? Don't you know that he's a habitual liar? Ten years ago-- Ten years ago, that guy's daughter really died. I checked. He said that his daughter was sick, but the prosecutor thought he was lying and didn't even check. No matter how much he begged, they didn't let him go. So that's what happened. That's not the prosecutor I want to be. But it could've been fabricated. If a prosecutor and NFS get their story straight and make some fake documents, it's easy to make a suspect innocent. Is such a thing even possible? Of course, if a prosecutor's willing. Mr. Choi. What brings you here? You should've called. It's about Myeong I-seok's case. Did you fabricate the evidence? -Pardon? -Did you fabricate the evidence? Answer me! You were on the case with me. Du-hyeon. What? You called me. Talk. What do you want? What? You look great in that. Aren't you close with Detective Go at Hangang Police Station? Yes, what is it? A while ago, when he caught the repeat offender of cellphone theft, they caught the buyer, too because they thought he was a fence. Honey, I'll be better. Can I get his address? Well, it won't be hard to get his address. I love you, honey. I want to confirm something for someone. Confirm? Confirm what? I want to confirm that he wasn't fooled. Where are you going? We have a department dinner today. I can't attend tonight's dinner. I must look into something. Why are you investigating after your work hours? Because the chief didn't give his permission to investigate this case. So I should dig into the case after my work hours. I'm going to do some digging. Is this the place? I guess he lives in a shipping container. -Jae-chan. -Hong-ju. What brings you here? I came here to find the cellphone owner. You too? Yes. -But that will be difficult. -Why? The guy who knew the owner is already dead. It won't open. What's that? Gasoline. Come here. Have you ever felt like that? As if you experienced coming back from the dead? I have. Really? When was that? It was when I was very young. I fell into water once. I don't resent you. I'm glad... that you lived. Because of that feeling I had, I was really grateful to you. I thought, "I really almost died. I really want to return the favor to him because he saved me." Because of that thought I had, I started to have those dreams. The dreams that showed me the future of the man who saved me. Are you all right? Prosecutor Jeong. Reporter Nam. Are you okay? Do you recognize me? Mr. Choi. What a relief. This is good. What a relief. I'm glad that you're both alive. Sir, let us investigate this case. Why can't you answer me? I just fabricated my report cards. Yu-beom told me that you'd raise his rate if my grades went up. And I got half of the raise. Come on. You punk. Why did you fabricate the report cards? Your father bragged a lot when your grades went up. Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son
