 {\an8}Mr. Jeong. {\an8}What's going on? {\an8}I think we should request a prohibition of departure on Lawyer Lee. {\an8}A prohibition of departure? {\an8}Lawyer Lee gave me a ride when I came here. Get in, Mr. Choi. And I saw a suitcase in the back seat. {\an8}It's possible that he'll flee to another country right after today's trial's over. {\an8}But won't it take a few days to be approved even if we request it now? {\an8}We should make an urgent request to get it today. Hold on. I think we should request a prohibition of departure on Lawyer Lee.

 "Oath. I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I swear that I will accept... penalties of perjury in the event of telling a lie." Now, the prosecution may begin the main examination. Yes, Your Honor. Lieutenant Han, were you the first to arrive at the rooftop of Haekwang Law? Yes, that's correct. Could you describe how it was when you arrived? Sure. When I arrived, Lee Yu-beom was holding Nam Hong-ju and was staggering toward me. And I saw two unfolded umbrellas from afar.

 Was there any other person on the rooftop? No, there wasn't. The photos I just handed out are Seized Evidence One and Two. Both Lee Yu-beom's and Ha Ju-an's fingerprints were found on the handles of both of them. Ha Ju-an brought the two umbrellas to the rooftop, and it means she planned to leave with Lee Yu-beom later. It means Lee pushed her off the rooftop to kill her who had no intent to kill him. It contradicts the accused's claim that he acted in self-defense. Please claim... that these umbrellas were found on the first floor, not on the rooftop. And that they might be different ones from those the witness saw. The witness was the first police officer to arrive at the scene. And he'll help us find out if the umbrellas he saw on the rooftop were the same ones as those found on the first floor. I'll proceed with the examination without showing the photos to the witness. Lieutenant Han, could you describe the umbrellas? One of them was a long umbrella, and the other was a short one. What were their colors? If you're not going to run, what about the testimony? Will you lie about your color blindness? If you get caught in a lie, you'll be punished for perjury. I won't perjure myself. Are you going to tell them about it then? Then you'll have to quit your job. Lieutenant Han, why aren't you answering my question about the colors? {\an8}WITNESS Lieutenant Han, what were the colors of the umbrellas? I... I am color-blind. How could a police officer be color-blind? What is he talking about? U-tak, what are you doing? This is not going to end well. Then how did he become a police officer? We're going to win. Well... But you are-- Yes, I'm a police officer. {\an8}And color blindness is one of the reasons for dismissal. {\an8}As soon as my testimony is over, I will turn in my resignation. What? He's going to quit for this testimony? Is he turning in his resignation? Prosecutor Jeong, please carry on. Officer Han, could you describe the umbrellas in detail, then? Your Honor, even normal people might not have remembered what they saw for a few seconds on a dark night. But the witness is completely color-blind. I just see colors in different ways. I may see color in different ways, but I can distinguish light and shade better than normal people do. So I can see way better than normal people at night. Your Honor, it's never too late to determine the credibility of the testimony after we hear him out. I agree. Please carry on. Officer Han, what did the umbrellas look like? The long umbrella I saw on the rooftop had a wooden handle. And it was hook-shaped like a cane. The handle of the short umbrella was shaped like a cylinder, and it had two dots. The color of the long one... was the same as that of the accused's tie. And the color... of the short one was similar to that of the front part of his robe. It was a bit more vivid. -He's correct. -It's accurate. He really saw them. Are the umbrellas on the screen the ones you saw that night? Yes, they are the umbrellas I saw. We'll wrap up the testimony. The final trial will be held at 11 a.m. on July 25. My goodness. Is Lieutenant Han going to be okay? He'll have to quit his job because of this. Let's not get awkward. I'm really okay, so we're still friends. Okay? As you well know, you should start preparing possible mitigating factors. As many as possible. Mitigating factors? Are we not pleading innocence? You're not going to need them if you push forward with self-defense. But still, I think you should try to get your time in prison reduced. Lawyer Seo will come instead of me at the next trial. Sir! Hey! You crazy... Didn't I tell you I'd keep it a secret? You should've said you didn't see anything. You can never take back what you said in court, you fool. I know. Your parents went through a lot in the countryside for you, an only son for three generations, to become a police officer. I'm not an only son for three generations. -What? -And my parents don't live in the countryside. It's been quite a while since they got a divorce and remarried. They probably won't say much even if they hear... I quit the job. U-tak... I've never... thought this badge... belongs to me. It's always been so heavy... and difficult for me. But... I liked being a police officer so much that I could endure it. I'm really glad... you were my partner. That's enough for me. I don't think I should hope for more. I appreciate what you've done for me, sir. You fool... It must have been so hard for you. It's okay. It's okay. This is not over yet. Yes, that's right. It's Lee Yu-beom. I received a tip-off that he might flee to another country today. Yes. I'm requesting a prohibition of departure on him. Just a second. {\an8}THE PROHIBITION OF DEPARTURE ON LEE YU-BEOM HAS BEEN APPROVED I knew it. My cutie is perfect in every way. Are you dating someone? I'm jealous of you. Mr. Choi. The prohibition of departure on Lee Yu-beom has been approved. -Really? That's a relief. -Yes. You did a good job today. Are you coming to the next trial? {\an8}It's the final trial, isn't it? Who will demand the sentence? Why do you ask? Are you not coming if I'm doing it and coming if Mr. Jeong's doing it? Yes, exactly. Sure. Then you should come. Mr. Jeong's going to do it. I'll make sure to come, then. Gosh, I'm so disappointed, Mr. Choi. Mr. Jeong, you did a great job too. I was really impressed by what you said earlier. The responsibility and glory of the investigation... belongs to the prosecutor? When I was investigating the IV drip serial murder case, I wasn't doing it for some reward. You know that. I firmly believed that Myeong I-seok was the culprit and wanted to catch him at all costs. That's all. Yes, I know. Then why are you doing this to me? Why? Why are you all... so harsh on me? November 20, 1983. That's your birthday, isn't it? Yes. My parents always forget my birthday, but you've always remembered and wished me a happy birthday. But have you been so good to me only to stab me in the back later? It's the same as my brother's. You two were born on the same day in the same year. So you've always been special to me. And that's why I'm being like this. You've been banned from leaving the country. There's no use going to the airport. You didn't... So... So you should stop running away. You should stop now. You'll get hurt more... and worn out more eventually. So please... stop being stubborn. And stop hurting other people. Come with me now. Please. -Mr. Lee, I'll go see Mr. Choi. -Now? Hey, what? I'm sorry. It won't take long. -No... -I'll be back soon. Mr. Jeong! Hey! Sir, you'll get hurt more and worn out more eventually. Please... Listen to me... It's too early for autumn leaves. I think I've seen this moment before... So it's time, I guess... You just made me realize that autumn has come. I thought I still had some time left... No. Mr. Choi! Prosecutor Jeong... Prosecutor Jeong... Please... Somebody call 911. Please call 911. Is this 911? Someone got hit by a car. Mr. Choi. Yes. Please hurry. He's seriously injured. -Come with us. -We are... Come on. Prosecutor Jeong. I have... I have something to tell you. You shouldn't talk. An ambulance will be here soon. You're going to be okay. A long time ago... Thirteen years ago, I saw this moment in my dream. In that dream, you said something... to me. Mr. Choi, listen. If you really saw this moment in your dream, please don't come looking for me. You'll live if you don't meet me. So... please don't come looking for me. No. That's not what you said. Please... Please try again. Hurry. We don't have much time left. Mr. Choi. I... Mr. Choi. When I meet you again... I'm an investigator. My name is Choi Dam-dong. Nice to meet you. I'm Jeong Jae-chan. ...I won't recognize you, like a fool. I'm sure you'll think... I'm so stuck-up and clumsy. It'll be frustrating. Tell the doctor to bring all the medical copies when he comes. Okay. Gosh, I have to work late again. I'll always make you work overtime on unsolved cases. Oh, and, Mr. Choi, let's go on a field investigation together. A field investigation? I'll always make you come with me on a field investigation. I'll never... listen to you... Prosecutor Jeong, it's dangerous to go up there by yourself. Prosecutor Jeong! Prosecutor Jeong! Let's go back to the office and request assistance. You've got to be kidding me. I'm wearing new shoes today. Seriously. Your new shoes will be ruined because of me. You will have to jump through hoops because of me. If you're still okay with all that... If you're willing to put up with me, then come find me. If I fail to indict him, what happens? It's going to be a disaster. You'll get on the wrong side of the whole nation as well as the chief. If you come, I'll try to learn as much as I can from you. I will... admire you... and respect you. That's it. That's what you said. So I quit my job as a police officer... and came to look for you. I knew this would happen when I came. It was my choice. So don't blame yourself. No, Mr. Choi... Mr. Choi... Mr. Choi... Keep your regrets short. Just remember it for a long time. You remember that, right? That's indeed... my chief's son. Mr. Choi... Mr. Choi... Don't leave me, Mr. Choi. Don't leave me, Mr. Choi. Don't go. "What though life conspire to cheat you, do not sorrow or complain. Hearts live in the coming day. There's an end to passing sorrow. Suddenly all flies away, and delight... returns tomorrow." Gosh, what a nice poem. Jesus Christ. You startled me. Sir, I'm hungry. I want to eat. Okay. I'll get you some food right now. You're not going to try anything stupid, right? I won't go anywhere. And I won't do anything stupid. My life... doesn't end now. I need to meet someone... in the distant future. THE LATE CHOI DAM-DONG {\an8}NO CONDOLENCE MONEY WILL BE ACCEPTED DUE TO THE WILL OF THE DECEASED. 271-16, BANGHAK-DONG, MUNYEONG-GU TO JEONG JAE-CHAN At 5 p.m. yesterday, the accused, Lee Yu-beom, who was on his way home {\an8}after the trial, hit and killed Mr. Choi, who testified at the trial, {\an8}with his car in the parking lot of Hangang District Prosecutors' Office. The accused, Lee Yu-beom, who had denied all the charges, confessed all his crimes after his arrest, according to the prosecution. He admitted to fabricating evidence during the IV murder case investigation, to having murdered Ha Ju-an, the real culprit of the case, and to having attempted to murder Reporter Nam Hong-ju. {\an8}So the investigation is expected to make rapid progress. The prosecution indicted the accused, Mr. Lee, for one more charge of murder regarding the hit-and-run crash {\an8}and requested that it be merged with the evidence fabrication, murder and attempted murder. I heard you're having an interview... with that jerk Yu-beom today, right? The investigation is over, but he said he had something to say. What in the world would he have to say? What about U-tak? He's not coming for breakfast anymore? I think so. He won't answer my calls. Maybe I should bring him some food. DON'T BE AFRAID. I'LL BE BY YOUR SIDE! EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE... {\an8}Do your hands still tremble? {\an8}Yes. The doctor said there was no problem. What's wrong with them? I know why. I've been there. Really? What should I do then? It takes some time, but it can be fixed. I'll help you. You'll help me? Yes. So don't be afraid. I'll be by your side. Every day for the rest of my life. Hey, I should be the one who says that. It's what you said. Did I? When? I'm not sure. Maybe a year later? -You saw it in your dream? -Yes. And you said you had something to tell your present self. What was it? Wow, this makes me emotional. My cute student has become a prosecutor who judges me, and I've become the accused. Me too. Can this be off the record? I already confessed all my crimes. I know what you... and all of you think right now. "Lee Yu-beom, that son of a bitch, finally gets what he deserves. Finally, justice... rolls down like waters." Now that he has nothing to lose, he's showing his true colors. He should be asking for forgiveness. Unbelievable. Don't be ridiculous. Today it's me, and tomorrow it may be you. What do you mean? Think about it. All this began with the IV drip murder case. When I was a prosecutor, I arrested the wrong person instead of the real culprit Ha Ju-an. And it led to this. -Right? -Yes. Each of you takes care of over 200 cases a month and thousands of cases a year. Do you really think you guys have got all of them right? It's hard to get a perfect score even on a dictation test. But you're taking a test that can determine other people's lives and that has thousands of questions. Do you think you're getting a perfect score? Put your hands on your hearts and think about it. Don't you guys have a few questions you got wrong that you kept to yourselves? Hey, Prosecutor Lee Ji-gwang. Don't you remember how you skipped an autopsy and messed up? And Sin Hui-min! You let Kang Dae-hui go because of the wrong indictment. I know this much, but I'm sure there are a lot more that you kept to yourselves. You guys are on that side because your wrong answers didn't get found out. And I'm on this side... because I was unlucky enough that mine was discovered. It was... just bad luck. No. It's you that's bad. When you were investigating the IV case, you decided the picture before putting the puzzle together. You even fabricated evidence to put the puzzle together, and you already knew you got it wrong. And that's why you were so angry at us then. You put the puzzle together after you decided the picture. You should've figured it out while putting the puzzle together! While watching us at the time, you must've been reminded of what you'd done wrong. And that's why you were so furious. You were not furious at us, but at yourself. Right? No. You must've felt disgusted with yourself. No! You must've wanted to wash off what you'd done... and hide it from everyone. Shut up. As you kept covering for them, you must've become numb. You're not here because you got a question wrong. You're here because you've insisted a wrong answer is right while murdering Ha Ju-an and Mr. Choi. You've insisted again and again. That's why you're here now. It's not your luck that's bad. It's you that's bad. The accused, Lee Yu-beom, should have pursued truth as a prosecutor. But he pursued fame instead, so he failed to catch the real culprit, and many people died because of it. He was a prosecutor, and a prosecutor should bring people who committed crimes to justice. But the accused continued to follow the wrong path even when he knew that he was on the wrong path, and he killed or hurt many people along the way. With the hope that people who administer the law in this country do so with more responsibility, I apologize on behalf of the prosecution to those who lost their lives because of the accused. And I demand this sentence. I demand... a life sentence for the accused, Lee Yu-beom. Mr. Choi should've seen this. Do you still read these books? Hong-ju? It's 11 oâ€™clock in the morning. Wake up already. They're so dusty. I can see that you haven't even opened them for years. And it seems like you won't be doing so for the next three years. What about the books? And what's with the three years? I'm going to give these to U-tak. He's going to law school. Really? He didn't tell me that. When did he say that? My dream said so. He'll have to study without any income for years. He should at least save money on his textbooks. Cooperate. Okay. I should. Bring your suitcase too. Sure. Who could that be? Who is it? It's me, Hong-ju. I'm here too. -Why are you here? -I've brought some gifts. Well... Okay, just a second. Gosh. Goodness, you're not any different from Jae-chan when you rest at home. -Is that a compliment? -You really think so? Anyway, what's all this? I saw a year later in my dream you were going to law school. Me? At this age? Yes, you were attending lectures with some young girls. Wow. I envy you. Seriously. That doesn't make sense. How can I go to law school? Why? It makes sense. I thought you were well-versed in the law when you were defending Do Hak-yeong. I heard you were good at it at school. I wasn't just good. I excelled at it. Damn it. And these are from my mom. Mom said she'll take care of your meals until you graduate. I'm so grateful. If you're so grateful, please clean your house and shave! And did you give Robin any food? He looks so hungry. Robin, have you eaten anything? My Robin. Robin, did you go out for a walk? Stay still. You've brought so many things. How did you bring them? You guys don't have a car. We have a car. You do? What car? Hey, honey. I'm on my way right now. I'm on a bus. My car? Well, Rookie said he needed it, so I let him borrow it. I don't know. He said he needed to move some stuff. Taking the bus is better than driving my car. Yes. Don't you think you've had enough sleep? DON'T BE AFRAID. I'LL BE BY YOUR SIDE! EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE... IT WAS U-TAK AS I EXPECTED Give me the key. I'll drive. Sure. My hand doesn't tremble anymore. -It was U-tak as I expected. -What? I told you, right? I told you I'd fix it. You drive. You fixed this? When? Now. Just now. Just now? INTRODUCTION TO CRIMINAL ACT INTRODUCTION TELL YOUR BROTHER THAT I'M GRATEFUL Dae-gu, I just heard it from my brother. The judge pronounced the sentence on Lee Yu-beom today. As Jae-chan demanded, it's a life sentence. But I don't know what to say. I can't say I'm glad. Tell your brother that I'm grateful. Okay. Hey, So-yun. I'm sorry, but I"ll have to call you back later. Okay. So-yun? Why did she call you? Well... she's my girlfriend. You're lying. I'm not. We're going out. See? That's so fake. No, it's not. It's real. Why would So-yun go out with a guy like you? You think I'm some kind of pervert who makes fake photos? That's a little... Okay, let's say you're right. Help me now. Move. -No. Hey, you. -Move. I have to work. 1 YEAR LATER {\an8}Mother, if both the groom and bride are my colleagues, who should I give my congratulatory money to? Your colleagues are getting married today, right? -I don't know what to do about it. -Maybe you should double it? Or divide it in two? I think you should give it to both of them. So double it? Double? No way. Just give it to the one you're closer to. And you're hosting the wedding. Do you have to give it to them? -Right? Maybe I shouldn't give anything. -Yes. Is the laundry open now? I forgot to pick up my blouse for the wedding. I'm taking side dishes to Officer Han's house. I'll pick it up on my way back. Mother, wait. What is this? The prosecutor's me, and the policeman's U-tak? Oh, that's... These lines... What do they mean? I think it's some kind of score. -But how come your score is lower? -Right? I think she kept score. It was a long time ago. Just throw it away. You know, I'm late. I've got to go. You guys eat first. Mother, but you didn't answer my question. What is this? You're not eating breakfast? -Bye. -Please. What are you doing? Mother, come taste this. Okay. It's good. Really good. If you mastered japchae, that means you've mastered all the side dishes. But japchae is easy to make. No, it's not. If it was easy, why would people only make it on special days? Officer Han, I don't think I have anything left to teach you. Oh, my. I should stop calling you Officer Han. Chosen your career path? What do you want me to call you? Judge Han? Prosecutor Han? Lawyer Han? I'll choose Lawyer Han. I prefer saving people to judging them. Lawyer Han. It sounds good. It has a nice ring to it. Oh, my God! -Thank you. -Be careful. -Thank you. -No problem. Gosh, this is bad. I'm going to be late for the wedding. Where did the driver go? -What's the matter? -Are you the taxi driver? I bumped your car by accident. So I waited... -You can just go. -Pardon? You know, a bumper's called a bumper for a reason: to bump into other cars. But if you still feel sorry, you should do the same when someone bumps your car. Thank you so much. Hey. I picked up the bouquet. Who'll be in charge of the congratulatory money? -Thank you so much. -Are you all right? Thank you so much. My goodness, that was really close. Hello? You know what just happened? How do I tie this? Cross it over the narrow end. No. I don't understand why I had to come to this wedding. Because one of my brother's closest colleagues is getting married. -And I have someone to show you. -Someone to show me? Who's that? Is this your necktie? Park So-yun? So-yun. Hi. Did you miss me a lot? Of course. I've missed you so much. Hey, you guys are really going out? Did you think he was lying? Do you still think this photo is fake? No, it looks real. We're good then. Wow, So-yun. You really came. What is this? You flew all the way here to play the piano for the wedding? Well, someone asked me to come, so... How is the flushing pressure of the toilet in your dorm? Yours should be really strong. Didn't it turn out that the big poop wasn't mine? I don't know. I still think it was your poop. It wasn't! It was your poop. Your mom was just covering for you. Hey, my mom would never do that. -Wait, did you just diss her? -How did this couple get caught? They're coworkers. Didn't they keep it a secret? You'd never imagine it. It was so ridiculous. -Hey! -What? You little... You illegally exaggerated the cost of purchase, sale and construction by 1.1 billion won. You're also guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust. You've pocketed a lot. I didn't exaggerate it. It was the actual cost. And if you look at the offerings of money to the church-- I know. You really made sure to give the offerings regularly. If you give the offerings, is God supposed to forgive you for the embezzlement? What? What's wrong with his lips? He's got my lipstick! Here comes the bride. I'm so jealous of the groom! You're so beautiful! -You're so beautiful! -She's pretty! What? Isn't that kid... I envy you guys! Is he Ms. Son's son? I'm glad he seems healthy. I envy you! Bride and groom, please kiss each other. Why was the kiss so light? This is a wedding. Please kiss properly this time! Kiss! Kiss! But my kid is watching. Kiss! Kiss! Thank you, Chan-ho. You're a big boy now! You're so cool! Ms. Son, we'll take bouquet toss photos. Please check who you'll toss to. Okay. Now toss it. You can do this. -Gosh... -Prosecutor Jeong, how could you catch it? -You did that on purpose, didn't you? -I really didn't. Let's try it again. -Again! -Come on! Again! Again! Again! Again! Please toss it on the count of three, okay? Three, two, one! That's a real bummer. What? Did you have a bad dream again? Yes. It's okay. It's all over now. Don't be afraid. I'll be by your side. Every day for the rest of my life, I'll be... So don't be afraid. I'll be by your side. Every day for the rest of my life. So this is it. This is what you said a year ago, right? Yes. I saw this moment in my dream back then. I was a complete mess at that time, blaming myself for what happened to Mr. Choi and U-tak. Do you have anything to tell your past self? My past self? I don't know. Just tell him this. You should say that you'll investigate and I should trust you and shouldn't worry. That's what a prosecutor ought to say! That's what my brother should say. Tell him that everything will pass. He may be having a hard time now... My dad will be released and hell will begin again. ...but it'll get easier as time passes. I think the autopsy must be performed. As a parent, that's my opinion. He may not believe it, but someday he'll be able to smile when telling the story. So tell him not to worry too much. He'll continue to make tough decisions and be exhausted. But after a year, he'll have a great... You'll have a great morning like today. So you should hang in there. He said the day will come when you'll think every decision you've made is right. So? Is it any comfort to you? So tell me. Do you really think that all your decisions were right? What is the decision you don't regret at all? The decision I don't regret? At the bus stop. At the bus stop? She can't be. Chestnut was a guy. I'm sorry, sir. I think I should take the bus.
