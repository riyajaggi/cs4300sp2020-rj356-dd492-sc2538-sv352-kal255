 {\an8}Yes? {\an8}Am I talking to the lawyer Lee Yu-beom? {\an8}The one who helped Kang Dae-hui get acquitted? {\an8}Yes, it is. Who's this? {\an8}Are you recording this phone call? {\an8}No. Why do you ask? {\an8}You don't need to know that. {\an8}I need to discuss a matter with you very urgently. Where are you? {\an8}Make an appointment for tomorrow, then. It'll be too late by then. {\an8}Spare me some time right now.

 {\an8}Hey. Who do you think you-- This is Mun Tae-min, the writer. I have four of your novels at home. Had I known I would be meeting you today, I would have brought them for autographs. Shall we get to the point? I needed counsel from a lawyer for a new novel... I'm planning to write. My gosh, what an honor. So is the lawyer the main character? No. A murderer is the main character. A murderer? What's the murderer's profession? He's an author and a professor.

 An author and a professor. Just like you, correct? Why are you singling me out? I'm sorry. All right. Please give me the details of the setting. So the story begins at the publication party for that author. I SUPPORT THE YOUTH, THE SPRING OF LIFE Thank you. -Okay. -Unlike your previous works, you wrote about the youth in your new essay. I'm curious if an occasion inspired you. Since I am writing creatively and teaching students at the same time, I saw a lot of students who were financially struggling to study. That's why I will donate all the profits from the publication of this book for scholarship purposes. Thank you. THE TRUTH ABOUT PROFESSOR MUN TAE-MIN I guess your pupil prepared a surprise event. Hello. I am standing here because I would like to reveal the truth about Professor Mun, our department adviser and the man of the hour today. This photo was recently published in the school magazine. He wanted to take a photo with us in the air until our knees were busted. In the afternoon of the same day, we had to move the professor's belongings until our knees were busted. That's not all. We had to drive the professor's son to and from school. We worked as valets at his daughter's wedding. -Are you mad? -He abused his position of judging thesis papers. -I want to expose him for his dirty acts. -Stop it. I'm sorry. -He continued to-- -That's enough. -Come out now. -Stop taking his photo. I criticized his thesis paper, so he must have been upset about that. Are you drunk? Even so, it's equivalent to attacking me. No. I couldn't be soberer than now. You must've given up on becoming an author. You're just asking to be kicked out of the literary circle, aren't you? Yes, I don't need to become an author. You only made me wash your car and shine your shoes. What's the point of becoming an author? I came here as a teaching assistant, not as your slave. How dare you! I'm recording everything. Treat me exactly how you always treated me. You bastard. How dare you! You... What was that sound? So the author strangled the TA in the heat of the moment, and the TA rebounded back and fell into the elevator shaft? Was there an eyewitness? I'm not sure. I don't think anyone was there, but there is something bothering me. There was a child's hat on the floor. I'm not sure if it had been there before or if someone had dropped it after witnessing the incident. How's the teaching assistant? As he hurt his head, he's unconscious. He's barely hanging on in the ICU. It's hard to tell he's alive. That's the setting. Are you saying he's brain-dead? Let's sort out the terms first. The main character in your novel... is not a murderer. {\an8}A brain-dead victim isn't considered dead in the eyes of criminal law. {\an8}It only recognizes cardiac death. {\an8}Is that so? To be precise, the charge would be manslaughter. Well, that's not completely true anyway... because he could be acquitted. -Acquitted? -Yes. Depending on the plan his lawyer and the main character come up with, he could be acquitted. Acquitted? That's great. I've come to the right man. Bring me some coffee. Now that I'm at ease, I'm craving caffeine. All of our employees went home for the night. We can get coffee later. To come up with a plan, I need to kickstart my brain. Surely you can do better than that. Damn it. How can I do better than this? What? What did you just say? To put it bluntly, you abused your power and killed an innocent student, and you want me to get you acquitted. You're asking me to move a mountain, but how dare you -ask for coffee when you're a criminal? -Listen. Lawyer Lee-- Your life is in my hands now. I have authority over the situation, and you don't. Fix your attitude. If I treated you nicely, you ought to do the same. You're a criminal. Know your place and be humble! Repeat after me. "Please help me, Lawyer Lee." Please help me, Lawyer Lee. There you go. Good job. Now, I'm in the mood to come up with a plan, Mr. Mun. Mr. Mun turns out to be a scary man. One of his teaching assistants was causing a scene, trying to expose the author's terrible deeds at the publication party. It was so obvious. Since he's a professor, he probably used their grades to get them to do everything he wanted and abused his power. I was a fan of his works. I'm totally disappointed. Great. So you interviewed the teaching assistant, right? I was going to, but there was an accident. What accident? He got drunk and fell into the elevator shaft. So he's unconscious. Drunk? My gosh. Newbie, come over here. I'm feeling a bit hungry. Go to the convenience store and get some snacks and whatever you want. Get me a sausage on a stick. Seriously. We ought to root out this culture of abusing one's authority. Being older doesn't give them any right. I can't believe they boss people around like they are slaves. You were talking to me, right? No, I was talking about the author. What is it? Do you feel guilty or something? Does it bother you or something? No. Why would that bother me? Why do you have my card? Let's continue with our meeting. Okay. SEOGU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Are you ready to get discharged? Yes. I'm almost ready. You guys came together. You got the ring, right? Yes. Yes. We met in front of the hospital. Did you guys decide to drop the honorifics? Well, yes. Does that mean I can do the same? No. That's messed up. You two talk casually now. And they talk casually, too. But not with him? Stop talking. You have my ID, right? Here. JEONG JAE-CHAN SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE See? I told you I was a prosecutor. Yes, you are. What? That's it? Do you have anything else to say? "I'm sorry for the misunderstanding and not knowing who you are." Shouldn't you apologize for that? Come on, what are you doing? Stop acting like a kid. Right. You're embarrassing me, too. I'm sorry for not knowing who you are. But I hope you will no longer confuse the articles in the Constitution or whine that you are a prosecutor without the proper ID of a prosecutor of our country. Whine? Hey. You-- Stop it. Actually, everything he said was valid. I see. He's just like you. He reminds me of you when you were young. He looks like you and is rude like you. What the heck are you saying? My gosh. Kid! Hey, kid. Doctor! Over here! A kid just collapsed! What happened? Is the kid okay? Yes, he's on emergency dialysis right now. He'll be okay. Dialysis? Yes. He has chronic renal failure. He's been on dialysis for five years. I think toxins built up in his body, and his body is swollen a lot, too. For five years? But he's only a kid. He doesn't have any viable blood vessels, so a transplant is the only option. But there's no organ donor. It's quite frustrating. I should have stopped him from drinking. I am sorry. When he drinks, he's usually very quiet. I didn't think that he would be in an accident like this. No, don't say that. Thank you for coming here. I know you must be very busy. Thank you. Please, don't mention it. I ought to visit him. He's my favorite pupil. I see. Doctor, the surgery went well, right? By the time he was transported to the hospital, the brain damage was already severe, so he wasn't able to breathe on his own. You need to prepare yourself, sir. What? Sir! Chan-ho. Mommy is here. Chan-ho. Chan-ho. Thank you for the ride. Where will you recuperate? At your house? Or at Hong-ju's house like me? Gosh, he should stay at home. Why would he stay at her house when he has a house he can rest in? Besides, aren't you fully recovered? Don't you feel all better now? No. I don't feel all better. I'm not fully recovered. My wound here... Then, you can stay at my house for a few days like U-tak. I can look after you. Gosh, no. That's such a shameless thing to do. You looked after U-tak because there was a good reason for it. -But Jae-chan... -What about me? Did you get hurt when you were trying to save Hong-ju? No, I didn't. But-- Do you live alone like U-tak? No, I live with you. But you're not that useful. -I'll do a good job and be useful. -My wound... Let me take care of you. Thank you for today. Let's go, Jae-chan. We shouldn't impose on them. Seung-won. Stay at my house. I'll do a better job since I have experience taking care of people. You can stay at my house, right? Well, should I, then? Jae-chan. Jae-chan, wait. Gosh, what's he doing? He's so dull-witted. Why are you so dull-witted? What do you mean? They are old friends who met 13 years ago. Let them spend some time together. Thank you. It must've been tough. I'll take good care of him. You should go inside and clean up your room. He has to take his medicine-- I'll make sure he takes it. Go clean your room. He might pass out if he sees that dirty room of yours. It's already clean. The abalone porridge is really good. How long do you need to stay here to recover? -Two days will be sufficient, correct? -Yes. Two days will be sufficient. Damn it. Where did it go? I'm sure I put it here. Jae-chan will be really disappointed if he finds out I lost the ring. Can I come in? Okay. Come on in. My gosh. This is messier than I imagined. No. Usually, it's not this messy. I was looking for something. For what? It's just a thing. Sit over there. Let me take your temperature. Okay. By the way, Hong-ju, do you not like the ring I gave you? No, I really like it. But why aren't you wearing it? It's a bit uncomfortable to wear it at work. At home, I don't feel comfortable wearing it because of my mom. -I'll wear it when it's just you and me. -You have to. Okay. Your fever is almost gone. I'll dress your wound tomorrow. You're a doctor now. I practiced it once on U-tak. Did you take his temperature and dress his wound? Yes. Why? Does that bother you? Are you jealous? No. Not at all. Not an ounce of jealousy. You didn't have to say that. Hong-ju, what are you doing? Come out. Let him rest. Okay. Good night. Let me know if you need anything. Okay. Thanks. Why isn't your fever going away? Because my heart is beating fast for you. It's rock hard. How can a knife go in here? Stop it. It's ticklish. I'll scold you. You're scary. -Stop it. -Quit this nonsense! Damn it. I shouldn't have come here. Gosh. I shouldn't have come. Mom, did you see my ring? The one Jae-chan gave me. No, I didn't. Did you lose it? I'm sure I put it on my vanity table, but I can't find it. What's the point of applying it nicely? You'll be going to sleep. Slap it on your face and go to sleep. No. My skin feels sensitive these days. What if I get a zit? Jae-chan is staying here. So, you met him 13 years ago. Do you like him even more now that you know the history? Why? Is that what you want? No. I don't want that to happen. Well, my feelings might deepen. No one knows what lies in the future. And after some time passes-- No, I don't want that. I don't want your relationship with him to deepen even after some time passes. Hi. I checked after talking to you. Your son signed to be an organ donor at the headquarters for organ donors. See? I knew it. You have a very brave son. Hwan, did you hear that? The doctor is complimenting you. Let me know when you have decided on a date. I'll do it two days from today. That's... his... birthday. Okay. Organ donor? It hasn't been confirmed yet. There's a patient who's brain-dead. We'll test for antibodies, and if they match, Chan-ho will be able to get the transplant. Thank you. Thank you so much. What did you say? Wait. He killed my son? He killed my son. We can't catch him because we didn't do the autopsy? What kind of law is that? JEONG JAE-CHAN What should I do, Robin? How should I bring this up? How could you let seven people die just to catch one guy? How could you let them die? Fine. Is this the justice you want to uphold? Is this the justice you want? JEONG JAE-CHAN What should I say? If you recycle the trash one more time, you'll wear down the ground. Did something happen? I had a bad dream. I was trying to figure out how I should break it to him. What? Same here. Is it about Jae-chan? Yes. Yours, too? Yes. Did he quit his job in your dream? In yours, too? Yes. All right. What is she doing? Why isn't she coming back in? I should tell him. It's about Jae-chan. What happens if we do? How will that change anything? We can't change anything even if we know the future. He can at least run away from it. If he does, someone else will pay for it. Would you run away? Would you be able to do that? -No. -I'm sure it's the same with him. He won't run away from it even if he knows. So you cannot tell him. I'll make him run away from this. How? Your bus is here. -Aren't you going to get in? -No. I'm not going to work. I'm going to skip work today. Why? Because the weather is annoyingly good. There's no microdust. And you have a day off, too. It's such a waste to work on a day like this. So? Where do you want to go? Du-hyeon, I'm sorry. The weather is great, so I'll use my vacation day in advance. The good weather must have made her go mad. What's gotten into her? Shit. Another all-nighter? Yes. Isn't everyone in our department pulling all-nighters? To fill in for someone? Hey, it's not like he's taking days off because he wants to. I'm sure he knows that our workload is crazy because of him. If he does, he should come back sooner. I'm sure he feels uncomfortable even if he's resting. Rookie. Hey. Come here, honey. Let's take a photo. My gosh. Look at this. I'm such a good photographer. Oh, my. You look so cute in the photo. My gosh. You look so cute. You're such a cutie! So adorable. -My cute pup. You're so cute. -Do I look nice? You're so cute. They are such a nuisance, aren't they? I thought about you and brought you flowers. What? You always make my heart melt. -I'm so touched. -My gosh. Where did you go, honey? I can't see you because of the flowers. Here. I can't tell you and the flowers apart. They use this to make beer which you love. Thank you. Where are you going? Do you want to go to the beach tomorrow? It's been several years since I've been to the beach. I'm going back to work tomorrow. You can skip work just like me. Will something happen to me tomorrow? What? What do you mean? I heard the conversation you had with U-tak this morning. You said you saw something in your dream. What happened in your dream? Why do you want me to run away from it? You need to make a decision. A very difficult decision. According to my dream, {\an8}you'll examine a corpse tomorrow as soon as you go back to work. A brain-dead patient who hurt his head in an accident. But when you examine the body, you figure out that it wasn't an accident. If it wasn't an accident, does it mean someone else hurt him? Yes. That's why you decide to do an autopsy, and you catch the culprit. What's the problem? The brain-dead patient... was an organ donor. Because you decided to do an autopsy, he can't donate his organs. So seven people who were to receive his organs... Do they die? Yes. So, from the shock, you quit your job. What if I don't do the autopsy? I can catch the culprit without the autopsy. U-tak also had a dream. In his dream, you didn't request the autopsy. You decided... to save seven people by not requesting the autopsy. The culprit will be acquitted of his charge at the trial because without the autopsy, the cause of death is uncertain. The victim's father resents you a lot, and you'll beat yourself up for it. Then, I quit my job. Yes. Do you know who the brain-dead patient is? I didn't see that far. If I request the autopsy, seven patients will die. And if I don't request it, I can save seven patients, but the culprit will be set free. So whether I request it or not, I'll quit my job. That's why you wanted me to run away from it. I'll regret it regardless of my decision. My gosh. What a crappy situation. Right. What a crappy situation. Let's go to the beach tomorrow. -Really? -Yes. I'll run away from this. Okay. Let's do that. I know I'm being a coward, but I want to run away. I never want to quit my job as a prosecutor. Of course you don't want to. Yes! If he does, someone else will pay for it. Would you run away? Would you be able to do that? Yes, I can do that. Totally. I'm sure it's the same with him. He won't run away from it if he knows. No, I'm the type who would run away from a problem. I don't care whoever pays for it. I'm not the same type as U-tak. The level of my conscience is very low. That's great. You know what I think? People ought to know their place. Excuse me. Can you take a photo of us? No, I don't want to. Why would you ask a stranger to take your photo? Did you see that? I'm going to do whatever I want, starting now. What a jerk. He's not even tall. Let's go, baby. I'll buy you meat. Don't let it get to you. Okay. I think your brother is a nice prosecutor. What was that? That was random. Your brother released Do Hak-yeong because he was innocent. Hey, that's his job. Teachers teach students. The president protects the people. And prosecutors indict people if they are guilty and release innocent people. He did his job. It doesn't make him a good prosecutor. Doing one's job right is hard. I realized that with my father's case. My father was a doctor who saved sick people. But he became a serial killer... with one bad prosecutor. Who was that prosecutor? There's a prosecutor... who fabricates reports and plants evidence, and charges an innocent man with a crime he didn't commit. What a lucky turn of events for you. I asked about your TA, Lee Hwan, at the hospital. He will donate his organs soon. If he does, that means they won't be able to perform an autopsy, right? Without an autopsy, it's game over. The case will close as an accident. You don't need to worry too much even if we go to trial. Getting you acquitted is a piece of cake as the cause of death is unknown. I trust you, Lawyer Lee. Mr. Mun, you should try to find out the owner of the hat. That's bothering me the most. Okay. We're really going to the beach tomorrow, right? Of course. It's a done deal. But what about you? Are you sure you can use a vacation day two days in a row? I've been working my ass off. I deserve to have two days off. Don't worry about me and look for a place to go tomorrow. Okay. Let's go. -Hey, come over here. Come with me. -Why? You were only supposed to stay at her house for two days. It's been two days. Come back home. I still have my stuff at her house. You know what? Ms. Yun brought your stuff earlier today. Stop imposing on them, and come back home. Okay. -See you tomorrow. -Okay. -Stop pushing me. -You're so shameless. Why does she keep pushing him out? I'm glad you're home. Let's fold the laundry together. Okay. -Mom. -Yes? I heard you left Jae-chan's stuff at his house. He was only supposed to stay for two days. I mean, but still, you just pushed him out so cold-heartedly. Mom, are you upset with him or something? No, I'm not upset. No, I changed it. But... I changed it, but it became worse. What if he ends up like Dad... I couldn't even stop it when I knew Dad was going to die. Mom, I couldn't stop it. I couldn't save Dad. Mom, I couldn't stop it. I'm sorry, Prosecutor Jeong. I can't bear to see Hong-ju... break down again. Which beach should we go to? Namhae is probably too far to go for a day trip. {\an8}NEW MESSAGES I sent you a box of onion juice. Did you get it? I'm praying for you every day. Don't worry about us. Just take care of yourself. Don't overexert yourself. Take more time off if you need. Without you, I'm the best-looking prosecutor in our department. Rookie whose absence is not noticeable, rest as much as you can. Damn it. Why are they being so nice to me all of a sudden? Whatever. I'm still going to the beach. Going to the beach in that outfit? Yes. I wear a suit when I'm going to the beach. I wear a suit and sunglasses. And I have the mat. Why isn't the bus here already? The bus to the beach. You're anxious, aren't you? You're worried that someone else will have a hard time because of you. No, I'm not worried. Besides, they can take this off my plate. I'm the only prosecutor getting beaten up by the culprit and getting shot, you know. I've had the hardest cases. And quitting my job is unimaginably unfair. I'm getting all the hard cases. The distribution of difficult cases isn't balanced at all. We ought to redistribute the cases. Forget it. We'll go to the beach another time. You should go back to work. Why? Let's go to the beach. You said you wanted to go. Let's not. I didn't feel good about going, either. Look. I even brought my laptop, so I could go to work if I had to. If we make a way, we will have a way. Go to work now. Okay, I'll go to work, but if I can't handle it, I'll run away to the beach. Then, give me a call. I'll go with you. I told you that it will be a difficult decision. Brace yourself. Okay. Hey, hurry up! Come on, give me a push! -Wait up! -Hey! He's it! Hey! Look at that. It fits you perfectly. You've seen me before, haven't you? In front of the elevator. No. I haven't seen you before. -Kid, you okay? -I'm Lieutenant Oh Gyeong-han. You're under arrest for assault. You have the right to an attorney. You have the right to remain silent. Wait. I was just trying to talk to the kid. What did you tell him? Look. He just peed in his pants. Let's go to the station. We'll talk about this without leaving a single thing out. Get in. Kid, are you all right? U-tak, how did you know we should follow him because he was going to cause trouble? You know, I can read people's faces. Will I become a senior inspector? I'm not sure. I'm here, boss. Hey, I'm happy you're here. Do you remember your scoop on the TA-- Oh, Lord. Yes, I remember him. The TA who fought back against Mr. Mun for abusing his authority? Were you buying real estate before coming here? Now, you're using your outfit to rebel against my authority. Well, I didn't wear this to rebel against you. Keep talking about that TA. Okay. I called Seogu University Hospital to ask if I could interview him in place of you, but that TA is brain-dead. I heard he's going to donate his organs to seven patients today. Seven people. This was the guy. What? I'm going to step out for a moment. Sure. Go ahead. Bye. She's definitely my supervisor, not vice versa. Call me if we catch the wanted suspect. I'll be checking my phone. And please check if the chief approved my file I submitted this morning. Okay. Are you going somewhere? I'm going to the hospital. It's about Chan-ho. Gosh. -Here. -Okay. -I guess her son is sick, right? -Right. I guess. It must be twice as hard since she's a single mom. You guys. Thanks to you, I recovered very well. -You must have worried about me a lot. -Yes. I'm glad you're back. You're back. Ms. Son. I guess they didn't worry about me that much. Ms. Son, what's wrong? Did something happen to Chan-ho? They told me that he might be able to get a kidney transplant today. Is there a donor? Yes. It's a brain-dead patient. I guess he's going to be diagnosed with brain death later. Once they diagnose him, they'll start the transplant right away. It doesn't even feel real. I can't believe it, either. It will go well, right? Of course! It will go fantastically! I don't want to worry other people. You know what I mean, right? I'm really good at keeping secrets. If I was a big mouth, people at our office would have found out that the chief gets fillers and Ms. Sin is a Buddhist. The chief gets fillers? Goodness, don't even start with that one. The chief is a fan of getting cosmetic procedures. If you look closely... My gosh. And Ms. Sin is a Buddhist? And she's a devout Buddhist. When she is leading her trial, she goes to a temple and bows 108 times. This is what she does. No way. I can't believe I found out these funny stories just now. Do you feel less nervous now? My gosh. When you get to the hospital later, don't be nervous just like now. Be calm. Okay? Thanks. You can do it! I'll call you. You can do it. Gosh, where is everyone? Hey, Hyang-mi. I'm back! You're back. Why are you walking like that? You like my back more than my face. I'll always show you my back, starting today. Okay. Thank you. Hi, Hyang-mi. Prosecutor Jeong! Are you all right? You sure you're fully recovered from your wound? You're not overdoing it, right? Gosh, look at your face. Your face has practically halved. You had a small face to begin with. You're the only one welcoming me back. Don't say that. Everyone missed you a lot. No. You were the only one. You can catch up later. Please take care of this first. -What's this? -It's a request to examine the body. As soon as the examination is over, they must harvest the organs. You must take care of it immediately. Right. REQUEST TO PROCEED WITH ORGAN PROCUREMENT BEFORE AUTOPSY According to my dream, you'll examine a corpse tomorrow as soon as you go back to work. What are you doing? Stamp the document and send it back so they can begin the organ transplant. Mr. Choi, what should I do if an accident didn't cause the brain death? What if it was because someone hit him? Then, you cannot approve the organ harvesting. You need to order an autopsy. Mr. Choi, accompany me to Seogu University Hospital. What? Why? I need to dig a bit more before I approve the document. Okay. He'll start digging as soon as he comes back? He always digs and digs. He's the groundhog of Criminal Department Three. I almost forgot. This is why no one is welcoming him back. Right. That's not mine. Yes, U-tak. Where are you now? Going to the hospital for an examination. You heard about my dream from Hong-ju, right? Yes, I did. I think I just arrested the culprit in that case. Professor Mun. Really? And I might have gotten a witness in the case. He's just a boy, so his testimony keeps changing. But it's quite detailed. The jurisdiction of the case {\an8}will be transferred over to Hangang Police Station. {\an8}TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION: SUSPECTS ARE MOVED TO ANOTHER STATION {\an8}You're back. Are you fully recovered now? Yes. Please tell me what happened in detail. I have to go to Hangang Police Station for an assault charge because of the kid. Your assault charge isn't the problem. Once you're transferred, they'll add the charge for your TA case, too. I thought once they harvest the organs, they can't perform the autopsy. The cause of death will be uncertain. Then, I'll be released without a problem, right? Once at the station, tell them you'll get help from your lawyer and keep your mouth shut. I'll take care of the rest. Damn it. This is fucking annoying. Head over to Seogu University Hospital. Yes, sir. Hang in there a little longer. Chan-ho, you're so brave. Right. If you get through today's surgery, you don't need to come to the hospital for dialysis. And I'll be able to pee just like other kids, right? Of course. You're such a smart boy. Doctor. Ms. Son. May I have a minute? What's going on? We aren't able to perform the transplant today. Why all of a sudden? The prosecutor just examined the body. He didn't approve the request for organ procurement. He said an autopsy may be needed. Excuse me. Yes? Have they started organ procurement on the patient Lee Hwan? -What's your relationship with him? -We go to the same school. The professor wanted to know how it went. The prosecutor came and examined his body earlier. He said he might not have been hurt in an accident, so he didn't approve it. He didn't? Do you know who the prosecutor in charge of the case is? His name was Jeong Jae-chan. He was very tall. Fine, Jae-chan. Let's do this. As you already made a mess, I want you to lead the trial. Let's crush you at the trial. Ms. Son. Why are you back so early? The transplant... It didn't happen. Why not? I told you. I couldn't believe it, and it didn't feel real. My gut feeling was correct. The organ donor who was going to give his kidney to Chan-ho... might have to get an autopsy. You're both here. The chief wants to see you both. He does? Why all of a sudden? He has an urgent matter to discuss. REQUEST TO PROCEED WITH ORGAN PROCUREMENT BEFORE AUTOPSY Hello. What's going on? What do you need to discuss so urgently? Our rookie complicated one of his cases as soon as he came back to work. Seriously? Gosh. He didn't complicate it. It's a matter we ought to look into. -Go ahead. -Yes, sir. I just went to Seogu University Hospital to examine a brain-dead patient. Had I approved the request for organ harvesting, they would've started the surgery right away. Hey, what are you doing here right now? You can't waste a second. You must approve it now. -I could not approve it. -Why not? I don't think he was hurt in an accident. Then, how did he get hurt? This is footage Reporter Nam of SBC sent me. It's from the publication party of Mun Tae-min, the author. And this guy right here is the victim. As you can see, he was dragged out while going against his professor. An hour later, he was found in the elevator shaft, suspected of suffering a fall. I thought he got drunk and fell into the shaft. No. If you look at the footage here, he wasn't drunk at all. And he drank way less than others at the party. You're right. So, do you think someone forcefully pushed him into the shaft? Yes. Do you have a suspect in mind? If you didn't approve it based on a guess, you'll be harming a lot of people. The author Mun Tae-min is my prime suspect. Really? I just got a call from Sanggu Patrol Division. He had been arrested for assault while chasing a kindergarten student. And the kindergarten student said that he saw the author at the scene. I see. There are a lot of suspicious points. I think you need to proceed with an autopsy. Chief. But the autopsy can't be performed right now. He's still brain-dead. Brain-dead patients usually die from cardiac death in a couple of days. Proceed with the autopsy, then. Then, he can't donate his organs. Should we skip an autopsy for the sake of organ transplants? What if we can't catch the culprit? What if the autopsy result says he died from an accident? We'll be wasting seven people's lives for nothing. My gosh. I don't understand this at all. How could you think about going against the bereaved family's wishes and ordering the autopsy based on this little evidence? The bereaved family requested that the autopsy be performed. You convinced them because you wanted to! To you, raising your performance score is more important than saving seven people, isn't it? That's not it, sir. Hey, Ji-gwang. What's gotten into you? This isn't a decision we must make based on our emotions. Don't you know that if there's a suspicion of a homicide, performing the autopsy to establish the cause takes priority? We need it to make the suspect stand trial. We must have enough evidence to proceed with that. Do you think the evidence he has is enough to exchange for seven people's lives? Goodness. Is that what you think, too? I think Mr. Lee has a point. Giving up on organ transplants and proceeding with the autopsy is very risky with this much evidence. What about you, Prosecutor Son? -Pardon? -What do you think? Should he approve the organ procurement? I... I... I don't think he should approve it. Ms. Son. The autopsy... must be performed. I believe... Prosecutor Jeong made the right decision. Ms. Son, are you out of your mind? Don't you know which case he's talking about? That brain-dead patient is supposed to give his kidney to Chan-ho! I know. But you agreed to requesting an autopsy? My gosh. You gave up on Chan-ho, so he could catch the culprit? I'm sure you know that's not why I agreed. No, I don't get it. I don't get it! If you're going to say something righteous like you made a decision as a prosecutor in this situation-- I didn't make that decision as a prosecutor. I made that decision as a mother. If I were... the parent of that teaching assistant, I would want to find out... how my son died instead of saving other kids. Hwan. Please tell me. Who did this to you? I'll catch that person... and punish that person. Please tell me who that punk is. Please? I don't care whether it's seven people or seventy people. Instead of saving other people's lives, delivering justice for my son would be more important. That's how a parent feels. That's why... I think the autopsy must be performed, not as a prosecutor, but as a parent. That's my opinion. This brain-dead patient won't last a week and will die from cardiac death. You can perform the autopsy, then. Deny this request. REQUEST TO PROCEED WITH ORGAN PROCUREMENT Which one will you choose? Will you choose to save seven people? Or will you choose to catch one culprit? If you were me, which one would you choose? If I were you, I wouldn't choose either one. Chief, can't the autopsy and organ procurement take place at the same time? What? I talked to the medical examiner. Although it is very rare, there are cases where the autopsy and organ procurement took place at the same time. In 2008, they proceeded with the autopsy and organ procurement at once for the bridge murder case in Busan. The defendant was sentenced for murder. In 2014, as for the ski resort case in Pyeongchang, the autopsy and organ procurement were performed together. The defendant was sentenced for manslaughter. And-- Well, these are rare cases just like you said. Once organ procurement is performed, they can't examine the organs. Identifying the cause of death will be very difficult. Right. These rare cases are very similar to this case. All of these victims suffered damage in their brains, not in their organs. {\an8}Signs of strangulation were found around their necks. {\an8}I think we can establish the cause of death {\an8}by examining only the neck and the head without having to examine the organs. I need more than a possibility. You must be able to do it, no matter what. Yes, sir. I will establish the cause, no matter what. If I were you, I would save seven people and catch the culprit, too. That's my decision. Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son
