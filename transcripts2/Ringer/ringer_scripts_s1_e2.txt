 Which is longer than some of the relationships that I've had. Things have been tense. It's been really hard to stay clean. But I am. I finally got a response from my sister Siobhan. She wants me to come visit, stay as long as I want. I'm not sure I'm ready for that. For family, I mean. I'm okay, but I'm not that okay. I just keep reminding myself... mistakes aren't tragedies, but: Please, Higher Power, help me learn from them. Shouldn't drink that so late. You're gonna have trouble sleeping.

 Mm. I have trouble with or without the coffee. Give me that. Oh... now you want my cookies. I should probably go. My guy's waiting. Are you sure you don't want me there tomorrow? I'm sure. Is that your boyfriend or sponsor? Malcolm? Sponsor, but... Sponsor. Here, Jimmy, I figured you could use it. Thanks, hon. Anything for you. Uh... pick you up 7:30. We're not having a sleepover? If you need anything... I know. Jimmy's got my back. You okay? Not really. Just get up on the stand, you tell the judge what you saw. You were a witness to a crime. You did nothing wrong, okay? It'll be over before you know it. That's what I'm afraid of. Bridget... we'll protect you. You don't get it. If Bodaway wants me dead, I'm dead. No one can protect me. In other news, tomorrow begins the trial of Wind River Reservation crime boss Bodaway Macawi. In 2009, Macawi was accused but eventually acquitted of the murder of a... Macawi is being indicted for the dismemberment killing of Shaylene Briggs, a dancer in his Rock Springs strip club. Jimmy! Bridget! That crazy bitch took my gun. Excuse me! Miss! Forgot your wallet. Thank you. Is that all you brought? Traveling light these days. I was wondering how you'd look after six years. Not nearly as good as you. Come here. I missed you so much. This is our weekend place. Make yourself at home. Looks just like my house. Except not at all. Your life seems perfect. Close to it. But no one's life is perfect. So... it's just the two of us this weekend. Where's Andrew? He's in London. Working. Then visiting Juliet at boarding school. So... how long have you guys been married? Almost five years. Bridget, listen... Andrew doesn't exactly know about you. About my visiting? He doesn't know I have a sister. ♪ How can it be that every time ♪ ♪ I've lost myself and I've gone out of line ♪ ♪ You're there ♪ ♪ And why is it that, when I'm such a wreck ♪ ♪ I look at the life that I want to forget ♪ ♪ You remind me I'm okay... ♪ I want you to know... how sorry I am... for everything.

That's one of the problems with being a sponsor-- you get close. How close? Let's just say I regretted it. Do you love her? That's none of your business. I find it hard to believe that Bridget would disappear without contacting you. Well, she hasn't... and I'm really worried. Well, you should be. Because, without her testimony, Bodaway's a free man. The guy's ruthless. He killed his own brother. Better hope I find her before he does. ♪ Time, it cuts you to the bone... ♪ This reminds me of Tahoe. Why do you think I love it out here?

Siobhan? Hi. Well, aren't you friendly? It's been forever. Two weeks is hardly forever. Have you lost weight? Maybe a little. Hmm, you're too thin. So, how was London? Cold. But I did get that investor on board. Congratulations. You're being sarcastic? No. Oh, I've got something for you. The maid said you're using a new cleaners. I'll take them in the morning. Oh, and that e-mail you sent about the ballet? I really don't want to go. Okay. That was easy. I'm gonna take a shower. Hello. I can't believe what I've done. Bridget?! Where the hell are you? I didn't think I had a choice. What are you talking about? What did you do?!

Tell me where you are and I'll come and get you. No, it's not safe for either of us. I shouldn't have even called you. ♪ 25 or six to four ♪ Bridget?! - Bridget?! - I gotta go. Bridget, wait... ♪ Should I try to do some more? ♪ ♪ 25 or six to four. ♪ Are you gonna get that? Hello? Hey, gorgeous! Where are you?! You were supposed to meet me at the loft half an hour ago. I was? Don't tell me you didn't know. I saw you write it in your little orange book. Why were you still in bed? If you skipped your trainer because I said you were too thin, that's just silly. Siobhan, darling, did you fall back asleep? No, Gemma. Um, I'll be there. Can you just give me 20 minutes? Make it 30. Now you owe me a latte. You look absolutely anorexic. You must share your secret. Good news. Got the marble people coming in at 10:00 instead of 4:00. The lighting guy can make it after lunch. What do you think of the exposed brick? It's great. Told you it would be. Just one question. Why are we moving again? Ask your crazy husband. It took me a year and a half to finish Park Avenue, and now he wants to start over. But it's the penthouse. Come see the terrace. So? It's pretty. You don't seem that excited. What's wrong? I thought you lived for this stuff. I do. I'm just tired. Andrew came home late last night. You're skinny and you're having sex? No, we didn't. The last time I saw Henry naked was right before the twins turned three last year. I think Henry's having an affair. I can't stand to look at him, let alone sleep next to him. Oh, I could so use you and a martini. Say you'll go out with me tonight. I would love to. Oh, no, wait. Don't you have that thing? What thing? The fund-raising thing? Yes! I totally forgot. I'll be fine. I'll just hook up with one of the workmen. I'm sure contractors make more money than out-of-work novelists. Hey, Jim. Andrew. Hey, you know, it's been years since you've worn that dress. Is it too much? No, it's absolutely perfect. Now, a glass of champagne? Actually, could you make mine water? I have a little bit of a headache. Absolutely. What the hell are you doing?! I just wanted to show you how much I missed you. Gemma said you were gonna be here tonight. Henry? Relax. Andrew can't see us. This is too much. No, what's too much is I haven't seen you in a week. So you got detained in the Hamptons. Fine. But then when you didn't show up at the hotel, I went to your place, and you just stared at me from the balcony like I was some kind of crazy person. And now this. I have to go. No, no. Not until you tell me what's going on. We can't do this here. Andrew's waiting for me. Like you care. Let him wait. Henry, please. Fine. Meet me at the hotel on Thursday. The nanny is taking the boys to the park at noon. Um, uh, noon... I could be late. Traffic from the new apartment. The apartment is two minutes away from the Dandridge. You're making me nervous, Siobhan. You won't even look at me. Hey, I want to see you. Okay. I-I'll meet you there. Nothing has changed on my end. My hook is stuck. Do you mind? Is everything okay? Fine. It just... I thought... You thought what? I don't know, that we were cool? Cool? What are we, 12? Of course we're not cool. But tonight at the gala, you-you seemed so happy. That was an act. This is your game, Siobhan. I'm just playing by the rules. What if I don't want to play games anymore? Well, that would be a first. I'm serious. Why can't we just be nice to each other, for real? Who are you? What do you mean? You're just so different. Just relaxed and agreeable. And you don't like it? No. I love it. I just don't believe it. Mistakes aren't tragedies. But please, Higher Power... ...help me learn from them. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but right now, it's the only choice that I have. Sobriety is the only choice. I feel like every time I clean up a mess, I end up dirty. I never meant for any of this to happen. It just did. The important thing is for you to take responsibility for your actions. In all this, I lost someone who meant everything to me. I just got her back. Now she's gone. Maybe once things settle down, I can go back to my old life, be normal again. But for now... Hey. Andrew? Juliet? What the hell, Siobhan! Don't you knock?! What's going on? Wait, is that my scarf? Send me the dry cleaning bill. Did you go through my drawers? Will you just leave already? I'll text you. Thanks a lot, Siobhan. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were coming home. It's my house. I can stop by any time I want. Of course you can. I just... I wasn't expecting you. I shouldn't have to be at boarding school anyway. The only reason that Daddy sent me was because of you. Juliet, I'm not trying to start a fight. Since when? Hello. Yeah, whatever. Some guy is coming up to see you. Who? Juliet, did they say who? Wow. Far cry from Wyoming. You ever been? My name's Victor Machado. I'm with the FBI. Siobhan Martin. How can I help you? I'm here to talk to you about your sister. Can I buy you a cup of coffee? So you really have no idea where your sister is? Not a clue. Well, then I'm guessing you don't know what kind of trouble she's in. Well, I assume you didn't come all the way out here because she was jaywalking. That's amazing. The same pretty face, the same sarcastic attitude. I'm sorry. I'm just not exactly sure what this has to do with me. My sister and I are not close. We haven't spoken in years. Bridget's a fugitive. She assaulted a police officer and she stole his weapon. Bridget wouldn't do that. You sound pretty confident, and yet you're not close. We're twins. Bridget was the only eyewitness to a murder. She'd been arrested for prostitution and possession. We agreed to drop those charges if she'd testify. But that never happened. We're very concerned for her safety. If she didn't talk, why are you so concerned? Because the man she was supposed to testify against is now free and he's going to make sure he doesn't go back to prison. Silencing your sister is his only insurance. Mrs. Martin, if you know something, anything, you need to tell me. She's facing arrest. Or worse. The bottom line... she's not going to get far either way. ♪ ♪ Siobhan? You scared me. What are you doing here? I thought I would check on the progress. At 9:00? I was in the area. Huh. Well, I was going to surprise you, but since you're already here, won't this look amazing on that wall over a black lacquered console table? Don't worry, those holes will be covered by tomorrow. Perfect. You know, if it weren't for this pain-in-the-ass renovation, I'd be obsessing over who Henry's having an affair with. Why else do you think I'm here at 9:00 at night? At least you have a sense of humor about it. Hmm. Do you have any idea who it might be? Well, I went through the list of usual suspects, but the trainer's gay, the maid's fat, the wife's best friend... I'm joking. Come on, you're so not his type. I'm not here to sleep with you. Why? I'm here to sleep with you. Henry, you're my best friend's husband. That never bothered you before. Well, it does now. I don't get it. What is it, Siobhan? Gemma's on to us. She told me that she thinks you're cheating on her. With who? - I suggested the nanny. - Annafried's a lesbian. Yeah, well, I really couldn't think of what else to say at the moment. How about, Henry is a great guy, and he would never cheat on you? We just need to lay low for a while. - I've been trying to lay low. - I'm serious. If you really love me, you'll stay away. This is the third time. I keep letting you get away with this crap, but I'm done. Daddy, please, you don't know what happened... No. You could have gone to jail. And did you ever stop to think for one second how your behavior is affecting this family? What family? Siobhan hates me. And you're never around. I'm going to Mom's. You know that's not an option. Great, Daddy. Just throw it in my face that she doesn't want me, either. Juliet, that's not what I meant. Juliet. What's going on? Nothing. Hello. Mrs. Martin, this is Dr. Marx. Sorry to call so late, but you didn't show up for your appointment this afternoon. I'm sorry. I, um, I must've forgotten to write it in my book. Well, reschedule when you can, because your blood work came back positive. Oh, is that a bad thing? No, a great thing. Congratulations. You're about four weeks along. I-I'm pregnant? Siobhan, what did you do? Pregnant? You sneaky bitch! So that's why you haven't been drinking. - Isn't that great, Henry? - Great. Oh, he's just upset 'cause his editor doesn't like his new pages. Thank you for sharing that. What? Don't let your bad mood get in the way of their good news. Congratulations. Thank you. We're both very happy. Well, I could use a refill. Henry. Uh, no, thanks. Step this way. I'm buying. I'm sorry. I didn't want it to come out that way. You know that's my baby. No, I don't. Oh, come on, Siobhan. We've slept together a thousand times, and you've thrown Andrew a bone, what, once, twice in the past few months? That is my kid. And I'm not just going to smile and pretend to be happy for Andrew. What do you want me to do? Leave him. I can't. If you don't leave him, we're over. Make a choice. Him or me. I choose him. I know we negotiated that. But I want out. Look, the, uh, wife just walked in. We'll finish this later. Do you think Henry was acting strange last night? You know those artist types. They're temperamental. What about Juliet? I mean, she seemed pretty upset. You both did. She got kicked out of boarding school. For what? You're kidding me. Tell me about it. Well, she can't stay here. Not with the baby coming. Come on, Shiv. She's got nowhere else to go. So you found them breaking into the bus station lockers? Four kids, easy target. Didn't think much of it, till we found this. Looks like your girl's been here. Her sister Siobhan said they hadn't spoken in years. Wonder what else she's lying about. It's Gemma. Meet me at the loft in an hour. I think I know who Henry's having an affair with. Gemma? Gemma? Gemma? Gemma? ♪ ♪ ♪ I fall ♪ ♪ To pieces ♪ ♪ Each time I see you again ♪ ♪ I fall... ♪ You have the wrong girl! I'm not Bridget.
