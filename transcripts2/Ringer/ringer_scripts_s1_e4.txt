 My name is Bridget, I witnessed a murder. Just get up on the stand and tell the judge what you saw. - We'll protect you. - You don't get it. If Bodaway wants me dead, I'm dead. I ran to my sister Siobhan for help. Siobhan? Siobhan? Siobhan killed herself, and I assumed her identity. It was so easy. I saw a way out, and I took it.

 They all think that I'm her. Her husband. - Her lover. - Make a choice... him or me. Her best friend. I think Henry's having an affair.

 You're here. Um, have you given any thought to dinner? I was thinking about that Chinese place. You know, the one around the corner. Siobhan hates that Chinese place on the corner, Bridget. What did you just say? Bridget Kelly. That's your name, isn't it? I don't know what you're talking about. They found your bag at the bus station. They thought it belonged to Siobhan. It was full of clothes that she would never wear. It didn't make sense. But then I found this driver's license... ...With Siobhan's picture and Bridget Kelly's name. It's not what you think. What have you done with Siobhan? I didn't do anything. We... we were on the boat, and she died. You let her drown. I didn't. I swear. I-I wanted to save her. I tried. You've lied to us all. Me, Henry, Gemma. Andrew, I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt any of you. Don't apologize to me. Apologize to her. Shiv? You okay? Yeah. You haven't slept well in weeks. This can't be good for the baby. You know, maybe I should just get out of the city. That might be good for me. I could go to the Hamptons. By yourself? Just for the weekend. You know, um, I could use some time on my own. You want to be alone on your birthday? Oh, my God, I... Everything going on, I... I lost all track of time. You, forget your birthday? Look... I know you're upset about what happened last year, but I had hoped you'd give me a chance to make it up to you. I thought we were supposed to be making a fresh start. No, I-I want that, too. I... I like how things have been between us lately. Well, if you want to get away to the Hamptons, let's go. We can celebrate your birthday on the beach like we used to. I'd like that. I'm sure I could finish up work early. We could drive out this afternoon. There's no reason for you to rush. I... I'll just take the jitney this morning. The jitney? Yeah. Really, shiv? I mean, whatever next? A new found appreciation for the subway? Just trying to keep you on your toes. I'll send the car service for you. In fact, I'll take care of all the planning. We'll do the usual, huh? Yeah. You know, I've really missed these weekends. ♪ ♪ Yeah, he's the one who came over. We have cameras all over. Hold on a second. Let me call you back. When did this come in? Hamptons PD just e-mailed it over. Smart move putting the duffel bag back where you found it. Looks like she's still in New York. Only way she could know about that bag is if her sister told her. Siobhan knows where her sister is. We're going to find Bridget Kelly. Sync and correction by Mlmlte www.addic7ed.com Hey, Malcolm, it's me. Uh, sorry to keep calling you. Just haven't heard from you. I hope you're not mad at me. I know you don't want me staying here, but I'm doing okay. Really. I just hope everything's okay with you. Will you call me, please? I miss you. Siobhan? You're here early. I pawned off my work on Olivia. Who wants to be in the city when you can be on the beach? Water's so calm today. Can't wait to get the boat out there. I'll pass on that. It just... the thought of it makes me nauseous. Of course... the baby. Work? It's just one text, shiv. I promise, what happened last year is not going to happen again. I should never have left you at dinner, no matter what was going on at the office. We were in such a bad place. I had no idea if you even wanted me around. I... Look. I am done with work for the weekend. This year, I'm going to make your birthday the best birthday ever. It's been a long time since anyone's done that for me. Okay, what you're talking about is not football. It's soccer, okay? And you have to admit it's kind of boring. So you're telling me all those games you sat through cheering and screaming, you were faking that? Getting worried. What else were you faking? Stay here. I thought you guys were calling when you got close. Sorry. We... we didn't hear you come in. We were just having a discussion, and then he wasn't looking, and the vase broke. No, you threw it at me. Is everything okay? It's fine. It's just a misunderstanding. We'll pay for the vase. Anyway... Happy Birthday. Thank you. I... I didn't realize you guys were coming. Andrew said we were doing the Siobhan birthday getaway, like old times. Assumed you were expecting us. We were. Didn't think you'd be letting yourselves in. We can leave. We should leave. I was really looking forward to a weekend away. No work, no kids. Look, if you guys want to stay, we'd love to have you, wouldn't we? Please, stay. It'll... it'll be a great weekend. I, um... I'll go get the bags. Sorry. Ah, think nothing of it. Bridget Kelly fled from police in Wyoming on September 6, the night before she was scheduled to testify. Now, thanks to the bag you recovered at the bus station, we know that Kelly was here in the Hamptons on or before September 9. Then she disappeared. Siobhan sent Bridget that letter long before Bridget was on the run. And the woman can talk her way out of anything, so confronting her about the bag will more likely than not get me nowhere. Unless I have hard evidence... something that proves that Martin and Kelly have been in contact. If I can find that, then I have probable cause for search warrants and phone taps. And hell, I can even charge Siobhan with obstruction of justice. Oh. Those eyes you asked me to put on Siobhan Martin... came up with an unidentified car at the Martin house. We ran the plates. Henry and Gemma Butler. That's very interesting. Why is that? Takes a brave woman to share a house with her husband and her lover. What was that back there? When Andrew called, I was so excited. And then Henry and I fought all the way here. By the time we arrived, I was so fed up, I lost it. I'm trying to believe him when he says he's not cheating. Every bone in my body tells me he's up to something. I thought coming out here would be good for us. We used to love the Hamptons. Now we can't even make it through a two-hour car ride. If you love him, you have to fight for him. You'd tell me if there was anything I could do, right? Thanks. God, I'm sick of hearing me talk about this. I am going to check out that adorable little store around the corner, pick up something for the twins. Okay. Think I'm going to finish up, and see you back at the house. I want you to know how much it means to me that I can talk to you about all this stuff. You're an amazing friend. Like a sister. Hey, Bridget over here! Oh Siobhan, it's beautiful. One day I'm gonna have one of those. We should buy something for our birthday. Mom gave us money. 20 bucks? We'll find something. Like... ...Those! They're pretty and cheap. Not cheap enough. But it's our birthday. I know. We're supposed to have tons of presents and a crazy party. I hate being poor. When I get older, I'm going to have everything I want. I just really want that. We could always buy one and share. I don't want to share. We won't know whose turn it is. We'll make it simple. It'll be your turn for a year. And then on our next birthday, it'll be my turn. And then yours. Like, forever? That's kinda cool. Gemma Butler? Can I help you? I hope so. I have a few questions. About Siobhan Martin? No, about Bridget Kelly. Siobhan Martin's twin sister. You were gone a while. The boys went golfing. And I found a backlog of six-months of trash magazines. Did you know that Angelina Jolie used to let her kids eat crickets? Why didn't you tell me about Bridget? What? Your twin? An FBI Agent just told me about her, how she's on the run from the police. You spoke to the FBI? Agent Machado? What did you tell him? Nothing because I don't know anything. I've known you for five years, shiv. I had no idea you had a sister. A twin? How do you keep that hidden? We're not a part of each other's lives. My sister... Did something unforgivable. What? She ruined her life. Just... one bad choice after another, till I didn't even recognize her anymore. I'm ashamed of what she did. Do you have any idea where she is? No. I should have been able to help her... save her. Just when I thought I had her back, she was gone. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I haven't told Andrew. Really? Why? I met Andrew after the fallout. I didn't know how to bring it up. I mean, I know I need to tell him, I just... I'm not ready. Well, he won't hear it from me. God, Siobhan, all these years, I never would have guessed. You're always so excited about your birthday. But it must have been eating you up not being able to share it with your sister. It was our special day. I miss her. I thought I was clear. I don't want to see you. It's our birthday. Red velvet... your favorite. You're moving? Yeah... to New York. I met someone. Siobhan, you can't just run away. Don't you dare lecture me on what I can and can't do. Andrew loves me. I can start over. I never want it back. Bonjour. Excuse me. Tyler, I've been trying to reach you. I was busy with work. You're not working right now. May I borrow you just for a minute? Sure. I'm really sorry about how things ended the other night. I was really sick. Yeah, it's no big deal. Besides, I met Simone. She doesn't speak a lot of English, but then again, she doesn't have to. Tyler, I like you... a lot. We had a connection. Is that how you connect with people... shove them out of your hotel room without a second thought? Look, I got to get back. It was, uh, great meeting you. Have a lovely stay in Paris. Hello. I hit a snag. Look who's here. It's just like old times. All day, all I could think about was this moment... wondering if you were going to show up, whether... if we were going to sneak off or just, you know, do it right here. What the hell are you doing? How many times do I have to tell you it's over? Are you kidding me? I was ready to leave. You were the one that asked me to stay. With your wife, to celebrate my birthday. This is how we celebrate. This is our place. With them sleeping upstairs? What is wrong with you? It's like you've forgotten the last year existed. Don't you remember how happy we used to be? ♪ Spend with you ♪ ♪ fell through my hands and went by ♪ ♪ without me understanding you ♪ ♪ you ♪ ♪ I beg you, let me inside ♪ ♪ don't think of me as unkind ♪ ♪ I was discarded by my own mind... ♪ I'm so happy you changed your mind. I always wanted to be here with you. I just had to keep up appearances, or so I thought. I take it you didn't have trouble getting away? Uh-uh. Emergency work meeting. Olivia actually showed up at the restaurant. You should have seen the look in her eyes when he left me there all alone. Wow. So Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to me. Hurry up and finish your book. I don't want to be apart from you another day. I'm trying; Work is going slow. The muses are not cooperating. Excuse me, I thought I was your muse. You are my muse. Did you bring it with you? I want you to read to me. Uh-uh, it's terrible. No, it's brilliant. Come on, it's my birthday. All right, I'll read it. Hey, what's this? Oh, I went and picked up the mail. I was hoping it was a present. There's no return address on it. I'm not picky. I'll take presents from anyone. Not exactly your style. Who's it from? An old friend. We used to pass it back and forth on our birthdays. Hmm, that sounds sweet. Why'd you stop? You really don't want to talk about this, do you? I want you to read to me. All right, but it's a first draft, so please just be gentle. Never. Okay. City burns by Henry Butler. "The traffic "in the city was worse than usual that day. "The smog rose hot off the grates, "into the streets. The mist parted as the door to the taxi opened." I haven't forgotten. I'm ashamed. And you know what? You should be, too. I-I don't want to hurt Andrew or Gemma. You don't give a crap about Gemma or Andrew. Maybe I didn't, but I do now. What about me? We were in love, Siobhan. We had plans. Somehow, overnight, that all changed for you, but where the hell does that leave me? I'm sorry. I really am. No, I don't want sorry. I want you. ♪ Shall I speak the truth or shall I bite my tongue? ♪ ♪ this fighting talk is tiresome ♪ ♪ I'm tired, I'm tired, I need to close my eyes ♪ ♪ but I know that home is like a million Miles ♪ ♪ no one sees us when we're making waves, waves, waves ♪ ♪ waves, waves, waves ♪ ♪ and all I want to do is walk away. ♪ Ms. Farrell. Excusez-moi. I need to speak with you. In my office, s'il vous plaît. Now's not really a good time. It's important. Neither of us wants to cause a scene. But if you wish to extend your stay here, we must discuss payment immediately. My office is this way. Hey, there you are. If we leave now, we'll just make the meeting. I'm sorry to interrupt. - Is everything okay? - Very nice to see you again, monsieur Barrett. I wasn't aware that you knew Ms. Farrell. She works for my company. And we are about to be late for the boss. You know how he gets. Please give my very best regards. Will do. Sorry to delay you. Just please come see me at your earliest convenience. Thank you. What's going on with you? Just having a lousy week. I've always dreamed of coming to Paris. I'd taken lessons for years. This is my first trip. My husband kept promising to bring me. When I left him, I decided to come on my own. Does he know you're here? Guess you could say I ran away. I had a plan. I had money to live on. But it's all just falling apart. Somebody drained my savings account. Can't afford my hotel. And I can't ask anyone back home for help, because then he would know I was here. You think your husband took your money? I don't know. I can't even really think about it. I just know I'm not ready to go back. And the most pathetic part of all: Today is my birthday. Wait. Let me get this straight. So you always wanted to come to Paris, and now you're here, on your birthday, miserable? Pretty pathetic, huh? Well, that is, at is not acceptable. Come on. We're going to go celebrate. What about the brunette? She's fun, but, uh... I've always had a thing blondes. Agent Machado. Found a citation from the local marina. Somebody took the Martins' boat out September 9, and then returned it to the wrong slip. What's this have to do with Bridget Kelly? The timing fits. We know Bridget was here that day. I followed up by interviewing everybody at the marina. Nobody saw Siobhan or Bridget. So then I checked local water cams, radio traffic, coast guard activity for that day. That's when things got interesting. Figured you'd want to hear this for yourself. Distress call, U.S. coast... To Siobhan. Happy Birthday, darling. Thank you. Sparkling cider. Really? Well, it is Siobhan's birthday, and if she can't drink, it hardly seems fair for the rest of us to indulge. Since when is life fair? I can't believe all these presents. It's too much. You can never get enough presents. And the personal chef? I don't deserve all this. We're just getting started. You are happy with Giancarlo? 'Cause the last time we were at Del Cavalieri, you thought the branzino was overcooked. Oh, it's great. I'm sure it's delicious. Mmm. Did you just eat meat? Mm-hmm. But you haven't touched meat for... Three years. I guess I just, I've been really craving it since I'm pregnant, and thought today was as good a day as any. Happy Birthday. But it's our birthday. We can always buy one and share. Like, forever? Hey, Siobhan. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it's just the food. Um, excuse me for one second. "Dear Bridget, "thanks for sending back the necklace. "Seeing it made me realize how much I've missed you. "I know it's not our birthday, but I wanted to return it. I hope you'll wear it when you come visit me." Happy Birthday, sis. You're wearing it. What? The necklace. I told you about this? You don't remember? You were, uh, pretty upset. I guess... it's hard... Thinking about her. Your old friend. You didn't, you didn't tell me her name, and you wouldn't put the necklace on, but you couldn't stop staring at it. Does this mean that you guys made up? Wait. Last night, I was, I was drunk and angry, and I had no right to talk to you that way. No, you didn't. Listen, I have watched you with Andrew for years. And you are so good at pretending, that no one would ever guess there is nothing there, unlike, unlike me and Gemma. Henry, don't do this. But when you were with me, it was like something else. And you had this look, like... Like I was the only person in the world that mattered to you. I lived for that look. Tonight... With Andrew... You were looking at him that way. I don't know what to say. I just don't understand it, shiv. But I do love you. And if walking away is what you want to be happy, then... It's gonna kill me, but I'll do it. It's what I want. Okay. That's not everything though. You, um, you're pregnant. And we both know... We don't know. That baby is ours. Henry, can you just trust me? Have the patience to know that we'll figure this out? Please? Coming? Hey. Come on. You okay? Fine. So, did I finally get a birthday right? It's stunning. I... I don't know what to say. ♪ I'm staying ♪ ♪ and if cupid's got a gun ♪ ♪ then he's shooting ♪ This all looks incredible. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Your favorite. Gemma, can I interest you in a little glass of vino? You're finally letting us drink. Sweet relief. I can't believe you did all this. It's amazing. Oh, my goodness. You gonna eat all these? No, you're welcome to it. Mmm. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you all for coming. Bon appétit. Cheers. ♪ So we're bound to linger on ♪ ♪ We drink the fatal drop ♪ Oh, my goodness! No singing. No singing. Oh, come on. No singing. It's a piece of art. We can't cut that. Great looking cake, Andrew. I-I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. ♪ Then fall apart in parts. ♪ Gemma? What's going on? Did you say something to her? No, no, I'll go... I'll.. No, no. You stay. I'll go. She'll-she'll talk to me. Your breakfast, madame. One night with me and you're already speaking French? Uh, one word a night. This is gonna take a long, long time. Thank God. Maybe we should double up on the lessons. Mmm... mm... mm... There is nothing that I would like more. Unfortunately, I have to go to work. But first... We never had cake last night, and, we are in Paris, so... Thank you. I love it. Oh, uh, I ran into the manager while I was downstairs. I actually know him pretty well. My company does a lot of overseas business. Clients travel here from all over, so we have an account with the hotel. It seems that he was unaware that we have a very valued client in town now... Cora Farrell... who will be staying here indefinitely. Tyler, you can't do that. You could get in serious trouble. We have clients in and out of town constantly. No one even blinks at the charges. I can't believe you did that for me. You have no idea what it means to me. It means that you can go out with me again tonight. Mmm. Have you seen my tie, by any chance? Um, check the bathroom. Will do. Ah... For you. Thank you. I will pick you up at 7:00. Okay. The plan is back on. Tyler Barrett just extended my hotel stay, on the company dime. This is gonna be easier than we thought. Gemma? Gemma! Gemma? Please pick up your phone or call me back, just... Let me know you're okay. I'm worried about you. You really shouldn't leave your door open. You can't be here. This is private property. This is a courtesy visit. One last chance for you to come clean. I know you're lying to me. Bridget was in the Hamptons, with you. This has to stop. No more talking to my friends, my... Hello? Hello? It's my sister! Can anyone hear me? Hello? It's my sister! Can anyone hear me? I bet you didn't know the, uh, the coast guard records all the distress calls that it receives. They have a dedicated channel. Most radios are tuned to it by default, so chances are, you pick up your boat radio, you're talking to the coast guard. I don't know what you're talking about. Cut the crap. You were with your sister on the boat. Something happened that made you make this call. What happened? Okay, you're right. I was with my sister that day. She showed up. I... Because you invited her. We found her duffel bag. It was nice, at first. We connected. And then, Bridget told me what she was mixed up in. She was just trying to fix things. I-I understand that now, but at the time, I... I was shocked, and... We fought. I... I was afraid that she might hurt me. That's why I made the call. I told her that was it. I-I never wanted to see her again. That was the last time I saw her. How'd you know where to find Bridget's duffel bag? I found the key, after she had gone. I thought it might be hers. I went to get the bag to look, to see if there was anything that might lead me to where she was. I'm just trying to do the same thing that you are, Agent Machado. I'm just trying to keep Bridget safe. Why'd you withdraw all that money last week? Because I needed it. There's no law against spending your own money, is there? I don't know what you want from me, Agent Machado. I'm only trying to protect my sister. You can search my house, my apartments if you want. You can follow me around for the rest of my life, but I promise you, you won't find Bridget. I think you know the way out. Bridget's sponsor. You never stop lying, do you? Gemma, I've been looking all over for you. That's for sleeping with my husband, you whore. How could you? I thought you were my friend, my best friend. I opened up to you about everything. God, you were the one trying to convince me Henry wasn't having an affair. I'm so stupid! - It's not what you think. - I heard you, Siobhan. You and Henry. How much he loves you. How you're pregnant with his baby. I'm so sorry that you heard that, okay? I feel horrible... Oh, I'm sorry. You feel horrible? I'm sorry, I don't want you to feel bad. Why don't you sleep with my husband and see if that makes you feel better? I didn't mean it like that, okay? It's just, it's more complicated than you know... Hell yeah, it is. Think of what this is gonna do to Andrew. Though I am going to enjoy the look on your face when I tell him. I hope you look exactly the way I do now. - Please don't do this. You don't understand. - Get out of my way, you bitch. Please, just look at me. What, Siobhan? What? Because there is nothing you could possibly say to me to make this okay. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not Siobhan. I'm Bridget. Sync and correction by Mlmlte www.addic7ed.com www.tvsubtitles.net
