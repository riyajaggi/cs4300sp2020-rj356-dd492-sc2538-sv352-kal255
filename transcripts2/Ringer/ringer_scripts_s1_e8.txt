 My name is Bridget. I witnessed a murder. Just get up on the stand and tell the judge what you saw, - and we'll protect you. - You don't get it. Bodaway wants me dead, I'm dead. I ran to my sister, Siobhan, for help. Siobhan? Siobhan! Siobhan killed herself, and I assumed her identity. It was so easy. I saw a way out, and I took it. They all think that I'm her.

 Her husband. The doctor's gonna check on the baby. What? Her stepdaughter. Siobhan has a twin sister. Oh, God. There's two of them? - Her lover. - That baby is ours. - Her best friend. - It's ridiculous. Aren't you supposed to be pregnant, for crying out loud? The only person I can trust. I know you've been in contact with Mr. Ward. Well, he called me a few times. He was concerned about Bridget.

 Well, now there's reason to be concerned about him. He's missing. Siobhan, we have a problem. Bridget's still alive. ♪ I must keep movin' on and on and on... Relax, the first ultrasound's always hard to read. Baby is no bigger than a bean. How's your head? Sore. Any idea why she fainted? Vasovagal is the likely culprit. She was in a hot, crowded environment. That's all it takes. Will you shift to the left, please? Everything okay? Well, I'm not seeing anything. What do you mean? I, uh, I don't see a baby. But I, uh, I-I thought this was a precaution. The nurses assured me my wife was fine. I had some bleeding last week. What? - Why didn't you say something? - I didn't want you to worry. I-I thought that spotting was normal. It can be. Doctor, please, what happened? I can't be certain. But my guess? An ectopic pregnancy. It's when the embryo is implanted outside the uterus, and they're rarely viable. So, uh, my wife is no longer... No longer pregnant. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'll give you a few minutes. I can't believe this. I'm really sorry. You have nothing to be sorry about. This isn't your fault. You know that, right? I'm just glad that you're okay. I made you some tea. Thank you. Does it hurt? No. What does it feel like? It doesn't feel like anything... ...Except sad. Look, why don't we let Siobhan get some rest? And you let us know if you need anything. Okay. Hey, bridge, it's Malcolm. I'm at the motor inn on 95th, room 610. I need to see you. I thought you were dead. I thought I was, too. What happened? I just spent the last week tied up in Bodaway's basement. He's looking for you, Bridge, and when I didn't tell him where you were... I'm so sorry. How did you get away? I shook him after I made him believe you were in Seattle. Made it here in one piece... For the most part. Don't worry. He didn't follow me. I was careful. I'm only worried about you. I still can't believe that you're here. Yeah, well, I'm not planning on staying, and neither should you. It's just as dangerous in New York. We got to get the hell out of here. I, I can't just leave right now. Why not? 'Cause I sort of threw Bridget under the bus. I made the cops think that she was somehow involved in Gemma's disappearance. Why the hell would you do that? I didn't really have a choice. That was the only thing that I could think of. I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to get you messed up in all this. Well, I am. You can't stay here. This place isn't safe. There's a hotel right by the apartment. I can get you moved in tonight and still make it home before Andrew wakes up. You should just go. But... you don't even know where you're going. I'll figure it out. Are you sure you're okay? Bridget, I just traveled 2,000 Miles after getting my ass handed to me. Cut me some slack, okay? Sorry, um, I was just worried about you. I'll, uh, I'll call you in the morning? I grabbed this before I left. It's your six-monther. Thought you'd want it... So you don't forget who you are. Sync by honeybunny Correction by Mlmlte www.addic7ed.com My name is Malcolm, and I'm an addict. Hi, Malcolm. Those words come easy now. Took me a while to get there, though. I had to hit bottom first. We all did, right? Yeah. Sure did. We have a new face here today. Feel like sharing? I'm good. Felix, want to lead us in the serenity prayer? Shiv? Everything all right? Yeah, I'll be right there. You don't have to worry about me. I'm okay. I took the day off so we could spend it together. I have a follow-up doctor's appointment. So I'll come with you. I'd rather go alone. We should be together at a time like this. I appreciate that, I-I really do. Um, I just feel like this is something I want to do by myself. Fine. I'll see you later. All right, we'll finish up with an easy one. What did the rabbits represent? Seriously? Anyone? Yes. The rabbits represent happiness for Lennie? He likes soft things, and the rabbits' fur is soft, so, you know, they make him happy. Very good, Juliet. Now, for tomorrow... Rich girl scores some brownie points. Way to go, rich girl. Course, rich girl's daddy probably pays somebody to read to her every night. We tried to hire your mom, but she couldn't handle the big words. Don't tell me, ladies... You find the book so enriching, you can't help but discuss it amongst yourselves? Oh, cool, finally. Um... Could you please do something about Tessa? It's-it's like she finds some sort of sick pleasure in torturing me. I'll talk to her. No disrespect, Mr. c, but I don't think her getting a talking to... I said I'll take care of it. It's just been a tough week for me. I'm not getting my trust fund till I'm, like, 25. Is that because of your little Fender bender? Yeah, and something really bad happened to my stepmom. She had a miscarriage. I'm sorry to hear that. If you need to talk to someone in the guidance counselor's office... What if I want to talk to you? There's a revival theater in the village that's showing of mice and men this weekend. The original... With Burgess Meredith. I have the DVD. Really? Maybe I could come over and watch it sometime? You're going to be late for your next class. Yeah. I fired the head of European operations. Oh. Good morning to you, too. I had Henri Jeunet escorted out by security. Mon Dieu! It's not funny. Well, what on earth did Mr. Jeunet do? When I was in Paris, we had an amazing dinner at Chez Julien and he showed me 20% returns. He lost transfer documents with my signature on them. He's blaming it on his subordinates, but I think he's lying. So, what are we going to do? Don't worry. I'm taking care of it. Is something else bothering you? Siobhan lost the baby. Oh, God. Oh, Andrew, I'm-I'm... I'm so sorry. You should go home and-and be with her. I offered, but she wasn't interested. I... I guess she's dealing with it in her own way. And how are you dealing with it? I don't know. I guess we were pretty set on not having kids, but... Since shiv found out she was pregnant, I was... I was starting to warm up to the idea. Can't you try again? That's a very good question. Hello? Hi, Juliet. Oh, hey, Mr. Butler. You, uh, looking for my dad? No. Your stepmom, actually. Is she around? Uh, no. I think my dad said she had a doctor's appointment. Right, right, right, first ultrasound. Oh, I guess you didn't hear. Siobhan lost the baby. I spent three hours in JFK long-term parking. I found a few hairs that probably belong to her, but little else. I'm sorry, I don't think Gemma's car is the key to finding her... It's Bridget, right? How long have you been clean? What time is it? Hey. You're here. That's all that counts. I'm here because I have to be, not because I want to be. Fair enough. So what's your poison? Mine was heroin. Crushing and snorting. Creative. I don't like needles. Listen, Bridget, I see a lot of myself in you. I had a tough time opening up. And I can help you through it. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were offering to be my sponsor. Hi. Are you with me here? I'm sorry. My old sponsor's in town. Oh. All right, yeah, and you just wanted to tell me that you're shaking me loose? No. Not at all. I like what we have. Good. You made me nervous there for a minute. You had that "I want to break up" face. No, no breakup, I promise. I'm just a little stressed. Having Malcolm here could... Complicate things. How so? I just... I'm dealing with a lot right now. Not just Gemma. My husband and I are, um... ...Going through some stuff. Ah. And Malcolm doesn't understand? It's not that. I... I want to be there for both of them. Okay. Hey, just be honest with these guys. Like you've been honest with me. Remember, if you come clean... You stay clean. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. I mean it. Okay, I gotta go. Bye. Yeah? Malcolm ward is in New York City. Does Bridget know? She's the one who told me. What is he doing there? Don't know yet. I'm trying to pace myself with the questions. I want to be supportive, not intrusive. Just following the sponsor guidelines. Just make sure he doesn't mess things up. Just so you know, I'm gonna take a different approach with this guy. The Gemma thing got way out of hand. When I signed on to this job, I didn't know that you were gonna make me... Spare me the details. I've spent the last few weeks listening to a man complain about his job. I don't need to do it long distance. I got to go. Just... take care of it. All right, Cora, I'm gonna ask one more time, and then I promise I will shut up. Are you sure you don't want to go with me to Rome? I mean, the company's paying. I think I need to see a little bit of Paris before I start on Rome. Hey, it's not my fault we never leave the hotel room. Oh, but it is. Mmm. I feel like I would just be a distraction. You need to concentrate on work. And why would you say that? You need to go get dressed. You don't want to miss your plane. Fine. This is Tyler. Please hold for Mr. Martin. Tyler. Andrew Martin. Uh, hello, sir. Oh, what can I do for you? I just wanted to let you know that Mr. Jeunet is no longer with Martin/Charles. Oh. Wow. I just talked to him last night. I'm so sorry to hear that. Me, too. So, what can I help you with? I wanted to talk to you about replacing him as head of European operations. Really? Well, then I'm not so sorry. Look, I know you're set to fly to Rome, but how about changing your flight to New York? I'd love to discuss this in person. Oh, I'd like that, too, sir. Excellent. Hey. Hi. Is Andrew home? Uh, no. He's still at work. Is everything okay? I called earlier, um, to see if your guy found anything in Gemma's car. He didn't. But we're not giving up. I want you to know that. Juliet told me about the baby. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to find out that way. Well, I did. You must be relieved? Why would you say that? Well, because it ties everything up in a nice little bow. You know, problem solved. That's a really ugly thing to say. Why? It's the truth, Siobhan. You know, I guess I should grateful. For what? Closure. Henry, we said good-bye at the beach. I thought you let me go. Yeah. I just thought that, deep down, when you had our baby, it might make you change your mind. But without it... It is over. ... there for years! What you need is mighty saw! The fastest, easiest way to cut, trim, prune and clear. Just wrap it around, pull it through, and mighty saw does the cutting for you. What do you want? NYPD. Lot of people been looking for you, Mr. ward. Cops found this on you. I-I thought you had this beat, man. What happened? We've known each other, what, seven months now? You've been nothing but honest and reliable, and... A dependable sponsor... And now you're skipping town and getting high? By the way, if you really want to stay hidden, don't pay for your motel with a credit card. And who would I be hiding from, Agent Machado? Well, I don't know, Bodaway Macawi, maybe? He's responsible for the way you look, right? He beat you... Till you told him where Bridget is. I don't know where Bridget is. Malcolm, if that's what happened, just tell me. You know me. You can trust me. If you tell me what you know, there's a chance we could put this guy away. And who'd believe me? I'm a drug addict. There's no evidence against Bodaway. - My word against his. - You're looking for Bridget in New York. You can at least admit that. I knew Bridget hooked up with her sister. But now she's gone. I can't find her. No one can. You know I want to help her, right? I'm not tracking her down to punish her, you know. I'm trying to protect her. Right. You're selflessly trying to come to her rescue. You need Bridget. Hey, I'm not denying that. She's the only witness to a murder that Bodaway Macawi committed. I know how valuable she is. I also know that she trusted you with her life. She's gonna reach out to you at some point. And when you do hear from her... I just hope you do the right thing. Hold him overnight, and then kick him loose. Kick him loose? We got enough to charge him for possession. I'm not interested in a drug bust. Malcolm ward's gonna take us to Bridget Kelly. Switching gears, let's check the financial news. Looks like a little bit of an upswing... Daddy's working late? Yeah. How's school? It's school. That girl still bothering you? Yeah... but my teacher's taking care of it. He gets it. You know, it sucks about what happened. With the baby. I feel awful. Why? It's not your fault. I'm not gonna lie. I was anti-baby in the beginning, but... Then I started to think it'd be... cool to have a little brother or sister. You think you and daddy are gonna try again or...? I don't think so. I really just... I want things to go back to the way they were. Maybe we could get a dog instead. Hey. Morning. Morning. I was thinking that maybe we could have lunch today... Do you mind? I'm reading. What's wrong? Just doing what you want, going back to the way things were. When did I say that? To Juliet. Last night. I heard you two talking. We really need to get some doors in this place. I just meant I want things to go back to normal. Before Gemma, before my sister. Trust me, the last thing that I want is to be playing games. Really? You blew me off yesterday morning. - I didn't mean to blow you. - You tell Juliet you don't want to try again. Because I thought it was too soon. Siobhan... We talked about it. This baby changed things. And without it, I just don't know where we stand. Take it, I've got to go to work anyway. Could we talk later? I've got a business dinner later. I would invite you, but I know how much you hate those. I don't. I just want us to spend time together. Well, you've got a very funny way of showing it. Take your call. Where have you been? I've left you, like, a million messages. I need to see you. There's a coffee shop on 83rd across from the park. Meet me in ten. I'll be there. Yeah? Mrs. Martin, this is Agent Machado. I'm surprised to be hearing from you. I thought you were leaving town. Yeah. Change of plans. Did you know Malcolm ward's in New York? Yeah. Have you spoken to him? Actually, I'm on my way to meet him right now. You think he knows where your sister is? I don't know, but if I find anything out, I'll be sure to call you. I appreciate it, Mrs. Martin. I have a better idea. You can wear a wire, and then I can watch you from a surveillance van across the street. - I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. - Oh, no, no. Come on, Mrs. Martin, you've been so cooperative lately. Don't make me do this the hard way. What, you're gonna throw me in jail if I won't do it? No. No, but I know some things about you and Henry Butler that you want to keep quiet, and I'd just hate to start talking if I didn't have to. You must be Malcolm. Sorry I'm late. Siobhan. Siobhan. I, uh, wish we were meeting under better circumstances. Excuse me? Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you? I'm holding up all right, considering the circumstances. Oh! Aah! Goodness. Um... Oh, that might stain. Will you excuse me for one second? Oh, come on. You gotta be kidding me. Sorry about that. It's a sign I've already had too much coffee today. So, have you heard from Bridget? Sir? Can I interest you in something to eat? Just leave the damn menu and get out of there. I'm good. Thanks. I'm fine. No, I haven't heard from her. That's why I came to New York. To try to find her. You know, if you do, you can tell me. You can trust me. It's not about trust. I'm in the dark. I was hoping you could fill me in. This isn't going anywhere. What the hell was that? You didn't tell me that Bridget's friend was a drug addict. We had your back. I just needed to know what he knows. My back? What about his? You should have gotten him help. You helped Bridget. Bridget was a witness in my custody. Malcolm ward's not my responsibility. Oh. I get it. Only help people if you have a vested interest in them. Malcolm?! You lied to me. It was the one thing you said you would never do. I'm sorry. Am I talking to Bridget or Siobhan? I didn't have a choice. I told you, Machado made me wear that wire. So you're Bridget now? Because I can't tell anymore. Can you? You think I like pretending to be somebody else? I hate it. Well, I think you're starting to like it. The clothes, the money, the guy. You're calling me a liar, but you're the one that's full of it. You know what? This isn't about me right now. This is about you. You're using. No, I'm not. How could you do this? I didn't do anything. Bodaway did. He got me hooked, just to take it away. He thought the withdrawal would make me give you up. Malcolm, why didn't you tell me? Like that's so easy. I'd been sober for five years. And that piece of crap took everything I worked for away in a few weeks. I barely got out alive, and when I did... I wanted more. But I can beat this. I beat it once, I can do it again. Let me help you, please. I could use some more money. No, I will not help you buy drugs. I need to wean myself. I can handle it. No, you can't. Come on, step number one... Admitting you're powerless. I don't need you to remind me of the steps. Well, apparently you do because you think you can beat this while still using. Malcolm, come on. This time let me be the one that's straight with you. How can you be the one that's straight with me when you can't even be honest about who you are? What the hell, Mr. c.? Why did you transfer me out of your class? You and Tessa were becoming a bit of a disruption. But I thought you were going to transfer her. I don't, I don't get it. I... I thought you liked me. I do like you. Just not that way. You're a good kid, Juliet, but this is for the best. You should get going. Seventh period is about to start. ♪ Can you remember when it started to rain? Tell me, Tyler, are you married? Uh, no, but I am sort of seeing someone. Ooh, French women are high maintenance. Then you must be French. Uh, actually, my girlfriend's American, but she's still high maintenance. But she's worth it. Well, look who's here. You came. Hey. I hope you don't mind. Your assistant told me where you were. Are you kidding me? No. Tyler, I'd love you to meet my wife. Your... wife? Hi, I'm Siobhan Martin. ♪ I'm never going back out of my mind. I'll have the poached salmon, please. And I'll have the filet. Oh, me, too. Rare. She prefers her meat still breathing, if possible. I hope the bosses aren't giving you a hard time. I'm sorry, but we're out of filet mignon. Oh. Oh. Oh, I'll take the orange roughy. I didn't realize I was sleeping with the boss's wife. Excuse me? Is that why you told me your name was Cora? So, what did we miss? Ready? Uh, yeah, I'm good to go. Hi, how are you guys doing? Can I take your order? Our special tonight is lamb with a Rosemary glaze. All right, shall we? He just took the money. Hey! I'm glad you came tonight. I am, too. And I meant what I said... no more games. No old Andrew and Siobhan. You're right. The old Siobhan would never have sat through a three-hour business dinner without a bottle of Pinot. And just so you know, I want this marriage to work, baby or no baby. Me, too. Tyler? I'm surprised you even answered, Siobhan. Excuse me? No wonder you didn't want to go to Rome with me. Too busy flying to New York to see your husband. Wow, you... you are an amazing actress. Three full courses of pretending like we never met. Tyler, I'm coming back to Paris tomorrow, we can... Don't bother. Tyler, please... Oh, and you might want to find yourself a new hotel. Martin/Charles is done bankrolling your stay. Tyler... ...So, heaven. Evening. I think I need some help. Andrew... This is Malcolm ward. Why didn't you tell me the other night at the hospital that you were a friend of Siobhan's sister? Your wife needed help. Just didn't seem important. Here. Thank you. I was kind of hoping that we could give him a place to stay for the night. I know he was a friend of Bridget's, and that's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but he was one of the only good things in my sister's life. You can do this. I know making amends is a scary step, but after everything you've been through, this will be a piece of cake. I'm just here for backup. Hey, Siobhan, it's bridge. Shiv, the man helped you out. That's all the convincing I need. Brought you an extra towel and I put a trash can right here, you know, just in case. I know this is awkward, but thank you. I'm just here for backup. You all squared away? I'm set, thanks. Are you coming, shiv? It's okay. Go to bed. You know, just give me a second. Of course. Are you sure? I don't want to mess anything up for you. You won't. Malcolm, I need you to know that no matter where I am or who you think I am, I'm always here for you. ♪ Look at all the leaves in the fire yeah, I mean, sign language is a great tool. I mean, even if you never use it, you can impress your friends. Think so? Yeah. Juliet. This club's open to anyone, right? Of course, yeah. Come in. You're going to get through this. Siobhan. This is my friend Malcolm. He needs my help and I need yours. Hi, Malcolm. I'm Charlie. You did the right thing coming here. Come on in. Sync by honeybunny Correction by Mlmlte www.addic7ed.com
