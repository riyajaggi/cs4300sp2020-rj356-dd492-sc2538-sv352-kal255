 Flashpoint (2008–2012): Season 4, Episode 2 - Good Cop - full transcript 
 When a cop shoots a young black man, there's a lot of uproar. He would be charged with murder and tried. The team awaits the verdict because whatever it is, they have to protect the man. And when he is found not guilty, a lot of protesters, which includes the boy's parents, converge on the courthouse. The team goes to escort the man. Ed who's almost recuperated drops by to talk to Parker about his future but before they could, they hear of the verdict. They ask Ed to come along. When they get there, things escalate to the point that they can't get out. So while another unit arrives to take care of the crowd, Ed talks to the cop who feels unappreciated. When the crowd attacks the vehicle and nearly injuring Spike, Jules offers to go into the crowd to find out what's what.

 Get on your knees, dammit! Mr. Buteau. Sergeant Parker, Police Strategic Response Unit. This has nothing to do with you. Oh for God's sakes, do it! Finish it! If you're gonna do it, do it! Shut up! I know where he's at and where he's at is not where he started when he left the courthouse. Sam, you got the shot? I got him.

 ♪ Gentlemen. Look who drops in! How are ya? Didn't bring Isabel? Nah, I left her at home. She gets too much attention. You get her in here soon or we're staging a raid. This is my entrance. How are ya? Oh sorry, I don't wanna pop a stitch. It's good. All the stitches are gone. Ah, you're a sight for sore eyes. I'm good. Still in one piece without me?

 We get by. So how's it feel being team leader, Sam? Better watch out, it's growing on me. How's the arm? It's good, it's good. Full motion, full grip. Physios tell me I'm a... I'm a rock star, so. Back on the dad squad - projectiles of a different sort. Yeah. No, it's good. All good. You, uh, you got a minute? Yeah. Hey, boss. Court services just called, we gotta finish gearing up. Hi! - How are ya? - Good. How're ya doing? Where's, uh, Sophie and Izzie? Oh, they're at home. Everything's okay. What's going on with court services? Agh. They're announcing the verdict of the Buteau homicide today. I thought that verdict wasn't coming down till tomorrow. It's hot-button. Maybe the judge doesn't wanna give protesters time to organize, in case they're not happy with the decision. Can we talk later? Yeah. So, so why's this an SRU call? If Grealy goes down, we escort him to corrections; if he ends up walking, we gotta get him out of town. So he's at risk? You wanna ride along? No, I can't. I mean, I gotta childproof the kitchen. Isn't she only like four months? It'll be an hour and a half, tops. The man has had a half dozen bullets shot into his body, leave him alone. Aw, come on. It's just protection detail. Doc gave me the all clear. You wanna hitch a ride? Fine. Observe only. Sam's still number one. 'Course he is. You wanna talk on the way? We can do it after. All right. Protesters have gathered outside the courthouse as the jury deliberates the fate of Officer William Grealy. A 20-year veteran of the police force. Grealy has been charged in the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Luc Buteau, son of prominent lawyer Jean-Paul Buteau. The case has ignited tensions between civil rights organizations and the police department. We all know my son was brutally murdered... But what you may not know is that Luc is the reason we immigrated here. We believed this country would offer him a better future. But instead, it robbed him of one. Yeah! It breaks my heart to tell you that we have seen no justice today. What? A judge has heard the story of my son's savage slaughter and pronounced his murderer innocent. Innocent of all charges! Judge didn't waste any time. It's a game-changer. So less-lethal only? Can't risk guns in the crowd. Where're we taking him? To the airport, where he meets his wife and kids for a "Force-mandated vacation." Give the city a chance to cool off. Looks like that's gonna take a while. How can a man kill my son and walk free? How can this man live knowing what he has done? While this man, this coward... William Grealy still lives and my son is buried in the ground. - Now, will we walk away? - No! - Will we walk away? - No! - Will we walk away? - No! We want justice! Justice! Justice! Okay, team, Spike's driving getaway. He's gonna drop Ed and I off at the side entrance, we meet up with Grealy. Boss, Jules and Wordy, you head in through the front. Copy that. We're gonna get hit. That's the idea. We need a decoy so they won't expect Grealy from the side. Okay, remember, they look at us today, they're not seeing the good guys. So no mistakes. Deposition room, this way. You got some egg on you? Oh hey, it's laundry day anyway. Let's go. In position at the side entrance. Copy that, Spike. Bill Grealy? Sergeant Greg Parker. Why are you changing? You fellas can all relax. I don't need babysitting. I got my own car, I can drive myself. We'll get you safe to the airport, you just relax and enjoy the ride. But in terms of your exit here... There's a reason why your lawyers want you to wear a suit. After a plane-crash, first thing the airline does? They send somebody out to paint over the logo. I'm done being whitewashed. I'm just saying, you wear your uniform out there now, you might be sending a message that will antagonize the crowd a little. I don't give a damn. This trial ruined my life. They found you innocent. After they charged me with homicide, stripped me of my blues, transferred me suited-and-tied to a cop-shop desk job. It's okay, Bill, it's just protocol. The Chief's gotta reinstate you, that's all. "Officer Grealy acted in lawful execution of his duty." Judge's own words. That's good enough for me. When I go out there, the cameras, the people... They're gonna finally see me for who I really am: A good cop. Boss, we gotta get moving. That crowd's not getting any smaller. Let's do it. Stay back! Mr. Grealy, you walk a free man. Do you feel justice has been done? First of all, it's Officer Grealy. And secondly, yes. I feel like I did what any cop would do. And after a year of having to keep my mouth shut, I'll tell you why... Sorry, ma'am, this interview is over. I'll get to the airport. I have things to say! And the city wants to hear them. Plenty of time for questions and answers, come on! Have you no shame? I was doing my job! What did you wanna say, Officer Grealy? I was doing my job! The city gave me a badge! I was doing what I was sworn to do! Stay back! Everybody just back up! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go now! Spike, we're pulling back. Let's go! Out of the way now! Go! Go! Go! Spike, we're blocked. We're pulling back until we can clear a path. - Go! Go! Go! Go! - Copy! Clear a path! What were you sworn to do? Tell me. Tell me. Kill children? Mr. Buteau, I can't imagine what you're feeling right now, but you're son wouldn't want more violence. No, no, you don't get to tell me what my son would want. I know he was a good kid, straight "A" student. He was a leader, he believed in peace. And what did peace get him? Sir, you can set the tone here right now. You can lead by example like your son did. Honor his memory by walking away with your head held high. Come on. Walk away now? That's not peace, that's surrender, and my son deserves better than that. Mrs. Buteau, please! Jean-Paul, let's go home. I will honour Luc's memory by not disappearing. This is not over! This is not over! This is not over! This is not over! This is not over! This isn't over! This isn't over! This is not over! This is not over! This is not over! This is not over! You see that? They hate me. I'm some kind of monster. Officer? You said you were just doing your job. Now how about you let us do ours. Hey, I've had a gag order on me for a year. I'm a free man today. I get to talk. You wanna wear the uniform, Grealy? You start acting like a member of the force. Because what you do here, we all have to wear. All right, what are the chances for our friend here. High building density, and the roof's not designed to support. Okay. Stay close to us. We work with public order unit, control the crowd. 'Kay, Wordy and I will do a code-yellow lockdown and make sure all staff and civilians are inside and stay away from the windows, and you set up command post. You got it. Okay, we've accessed security feeds. The riot police have arrived. Look at these riot cops playing up the swagger. It's not helping things. All right. It's Sergeant Blount, public order unit. You coming with me, Eddie? Yeah. You'd rather we invite them to croquet? I'm just saying intimidation tactics may not be the way to go here today, that's all. You flex your muscles, you might push 'em past the tipping point. Crowd psychology has its own rule: The collective I.Q. drops by half and people do crazy-ass crap they'd never do alone. Which is why we have to keep our message real simple. Tim, this isn't your everyday mob here. There are innocent people. Greg, I'm sorry, I'm working here. Sign me up for your workshop on a training day. Gimme the bat! The protesters are swarming the truck. I need backup! On the car! Get on the car! Spike, we're on our way. Don't open those doors. Keeping the doors closed. Going with that. Getting to feel like a hard day's night in here. Get back! Go! Go! Go! Spike! ♪ Flashpoint 4x02 ♪ Good Cop Original Air Date on July 15, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ Clear the way! Make a lane! Make a lane! We're almost there, Spike. Spike! Spike! Spike! Spike, grab my arm! Come on! Watch it! We've got him, boss. That's good work, guys. Outta the way! Blount to unit, bring out the jail truck. Disperse the crowd. Any resistance, deploy the sound canon and CS charges. Greg, the situation's getting worse here. I can't watch this. Sam, what's your twenty? We're in the building, heading up the staircase. Stand by. Eddie... We're outnumbered. Encountering heavy resistance. Requesting official support. They hate my guts out there. You know what? If it's any consolation, this isn't just about you. It's about cops, it's about all of us. You know, man, 20 years ago I chose this job for love. For the man on the street, the woman in distress, the frickin' cat up the tree... I was so proud to be there. And you should be. And now? I pull over a speeding car, they roll down the window, I don't know what I'm gonna see: A gun, some sick piece of puke with a knife. He's thinking, "Why doesn't this son of a bitch cop just leave me alone?" I can't remember the last time somebody was happy to see me. One exception... My wife. Let my her know I'm okay. How's she doing in all this? I don't think I could've made it if it wasn't for Cheryl. She's taken flak at work, my son got beat up at school because of me. This might turn out to be a good thing, you know. A chance to reconnect, get some time away. Come on, baby. Let's get you to sit down. We're gonna get you some oxygen. No, I'm good, I'm good. I just need some light. Spike, you took in a lot of smoke. And the walk back here did me good. What is it? - It's a pipebomb. - Typical anarchist weapon. Yeah, except these guys aren't amateurs. We saw them at the G20. They had molotovs there too. You still think you can target their leaders? It's hard to pin them down, they're using black bloc techniques. Dress in black, hide your face, vandalize, agitate... Then blend right back into the bloc, or ditch the black gear and disappear into the civilians. Except I recognize him. The guy with the eyebrow scar? He got right in my face. I can do a facial recognition search from the Interpol database. Check out his body language. Even the civilians are following his lead. But we get too close, he disappears. We'd have to round up everyone who's dressed like him. Isn't that fashion profiling? What if we go down there and join 'em? Are you kidding me? You'd be swarmed. Those guys are outta control. Not if I don't look like a cop. Undercover? I can get down there and blend in, find out who the major players are, figure out their next move... Stop it. Yeah, and if your cover's blown? I know. But let's face it, nobody brings just one pipe-bomb to a riot. Okay. I'll let my unit know you have an undercover officer. Negative. She'll be exposed if she's treated differently. She knows what she's doing. Don't try to talk me out of this. Expropriated for the cause. Thanks. A disposable cell. Get the intel, get out fast, get out safe. Sam'll be on the roof watching. Got it. All right. Fight the power, not the people! Fight the power, not the people! Fight the power, not the people! Fight the power, not the people! She's in. That's good. Keep a close eye. Fight the power, not the people! Fight the power, not the people! Fight the power, not the people! Fight the power! Fight the power! Fight the power! Spike, Wordy, on your three o'clock. Molotov cocktail. To your left. Mohawk style motorcycle helmet. Let me go! Get your hands off me! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! Hey, officer, where's your badge number, huh? Yeah, not feeling accountable today? You're supposed to keep the peace, not cause war! Don't know what she's saying, but she's definitely earning her street cred. Okay, Mr. Anonymous! What are you doing? Get the hell off her, it's just a camera! I got her, I got her! Boss, got a visual on Jules. She's getting arrested. Do we intercept? She injured? She's looks okay. Keep up the targeted strikes with Sam. She might get some intelligence from the other detainees. All right, got it. Like where the hell this gun came from. Anarchists target property, guns target people. There's something wrong with this picture. Sons of bitches! He got you good. I don't think he agreed to my analysis of the roots of oppression. Haven't seen you before. I took a bus up from Kingston. I'm J.C. Maddy. So you were at the G20 too? Who wasn't? I got kenneled on Queen Street for like five hours. So medieval. You see this scar? I got sliced blowing up a police car. All right, let's bring in our guy with the scar. I'd like a word with him. We didn't break any laws! Let us go! Let us go. Officers? No, hey, thank you. Officers, we'll take it from here. Mr. Buteau. Mr. and Mrs. Buteau, we apologize, clearly our colleagues had no idea who you were. We're gonna need a hell of a lot more than an apology. - Jean-Paul! - We understand, sir. There will be a time and place for that. Then why are you taking us away from here? It might be a good time to go home. Why, so you can sweep it under the rug and cover up for your colleagues like you did with my son? I'm not giving up! Jean-Paul, il est trop blesser! Allons la Maison. Non! Laisse tomber. Il a parti. Laisse tomber. Allons la Maison. Non! Jean-Paul! She's not answering the phone. Okay. Thank you. What? What is it? Let's go. Come on, Lane, what's going on? Okay... Your wife and kids are fine. Good. Are they at the airport? 'Cause it's not looking like I'm gonna make this flight. You're gonna be on a later flight here, Bill. They're not coming with you. She's leaving me. Nobody's saying that, okay? Maybe she just thinks that some time alone might be... You know... A good idea here. Yeah, now that I'm running free, I guess she wants to do the same. You know, my wife Sophie, for 17 years, I basically took from her, Bill. I took and she gave and I never gave anything back. And one day she left me. Hell of a wake-up call. Yeah, but... You know what? She came back. We made a lot of changes. And your wife's asking for space here, Bill. Give it to her. Maybe it's not over here, Bill. Could you gimme a second? Please? Yeah. Here you are in Seattle... Quebec City... New York City... And now you're back home. You're racking up quite a few air miles. Can't prove it's me. I'd say the scar over your eyebrow says otherwise, Joshua Leclerc. I don't answer to that name. Okay then, Yosh. Look, I'm not here to debate the legitimacy of organized protest or today's verdict. There are people in this crowd who are a threat to the peace. Threat to the peace? Yeah, remember the G20? You cops held lawful protesters without food or water for five hours. Where you left a nine-year-old girl to wet her pants in a holding cell. Mistakes were made. Is that what you call the assassination of Luc Buteau? No, I call it a tragedy. Something we don't wanna see repeated here today. But there are dangerous weapons concealed on your friends. There's a loaded gun... I don't know anything about a gun. You should've been in Genoa. I wanted to but they said my passport was invalid. That was the best protest since Seattle - open, cooperative, equal. Now, we get Yosh here treating us like spear carriers in his own private Yosh army. That's not very democratic. What's the deal with Yosh? I don't get it. Since he hooked up with his buddy Pip, he pretty much appointed himself leader. I'm like, hello? Anarchism? Not about follow the leader. Maybe Pip's the one that's turning him around. You ask me? She's the one who's dangerous. She's the one? Dangerous how? Pippy comes outta nowhere, starts hanging with Yosh, goes on and on about this trial. This one racist cop. Yosh says she's got a "strong vision". If you ask me, it's more like obsession. With Bill Grealy. Is that why she brought the gun? How'd you know about her gun? Hey. Hey! Section 12F states that "Incarcerated subjects may not be denied basic physical needs". I gotta take a leak. Jules. Okay, the firearm belongs to a young woman, goes by the name "Pip" or "Pippy". She's allies with your guy Yosh. Hold on. She recently just joined up with the anarchists, but it's not about hating the state. It's about hating Grealy. Well, maybe she's tried to use the riot to conceal an attack. That's what I'm thinking. But she lost her chance in the crowd, so she fired off a few shots to create a distraction. Yeah, to try a plan B. Dammit! Okay, Jules, good work. Just come back here. Grealy's gone. Say again? He's gone. He took the rear stairs to the auditorium. Check the CCTV Cam in the parking garage. He's probably gone home to talk to his wife. Ed, you were right. Looks like Grealy headed to his SUV. That's gotta be Pippy. Ed, she was waiting for him. She pulled a gun on him and that was six minutes ago. Team one, new deal. Subject is a young woman, goes by Pippy. She's taken Grealy out of the building in his own vehicle. Let's approach with caution. Let's get Grealy, get him back here safe. Drive. She's taken Bill Grealy in his own vehicle, vicinity of the courthouse. Put out an APB, all units, but do not engage. Subject may not have very high regard for Grealy's life. Yosh. Listen to me, okay? Your friend Pippy's life depends on the choice you're about to make in the next 30 seconds. Now, she's taken him somewhere private with the intention of killing him. Now, we're going to catch up to her by then and if it comes down to his life or hers, we're gonna have to shoot your friend. Unless you help us get through to her. Happens fast. It's a single shot to Pippy's brain stem. Officer Lane here is a sniper, he can do it from two kilometers away. I never miss. It's Phillipa. Phillipa Durst. She started coming to meetings a few months back. All she could talk about was this trial. How we had to make sure that cop got what was coming to him. And what about her home, her family? She wasn't the type to open up. She sort of squats, panhandles. I don't know where she'd be going. Seriously. I have no idea. The thing is... She's not a bad person. Don't kill her. Boss, Jules back? Yeah, she's here. She's fine. We got eleven subjects apprehended and held for questioning. Well, that's good work. Public order unit's holding ground now, this riot's pretty much over. Anything? Checked every Durst family in town. No Philippa. Well, this case was personal. Maybe she knew the victim. Where did Luc go to school? See, there's a memorial page. He was at Gladwell High School. Look at that. Luc did everything: Chess club, French, debating... He was super-smart. Yeah. Look, it's Pippy. Perfect match to the garage CCTV. - Callaghan. - Hey, Spike. We need to talk to Luc's family before this day gets any darker. I want you to do it. Cruisers spotted Grealy's car at Jarvis and Wellesley. Which direction? That's all we got. They lost sight. Okay, Sam, alert all units. Alert all units, eyes open. Sorry, Sam. No worries, we're on our way. She was Luc's best friend. They were both in the gifted program. They studied together. But my husband knows her best. Do you think maybe I could talk to him for a sec? He's not here right now. It's five, he's at the greenhouse. The greenhouse. Where it happened? Jean-Paul goes every day. You hear that? Allan Gardens; that's close to Jarvis and Wellesley. Pippy's taking Grealy to Luc's father. It's poetic justice - kill him where he killed Luc. Let's step on it. Spike, you keep at it, you're doing great. Copy. Did Pippy have any family? She never really talked about them. She would come over after school, they would do their homework together. I don't think she had anywhere else to go. Bulbophyllum, epidendrum, denbrobium, and pleuro... Pleuro-something. Pleurothallis. Orchids. What were we thinking? Totally should've went with daisies. Yeah.  It didn't take time before there was a plate set for her most nights. It was beautiful to see Pippy blossom. She had a future. Jean-Paul helped her with her university applications. She was accepted in the same program as Luc. And when your son died? She had a breakdown; she failed her classes and dropped out. Did you stay in touch with her? For a while, but nothing was the same. I failed you, son. I failed you on every front. Forgive me, I tried... I tried hard, you know. I miss you. How dare you?! Get out! Get out now! I knew it! I knew you couldn't let him walk away either, like you said at the courthouse. Pippy, what're you doing? Why does he get to live? Well, he doesn't. Eddie, what's up? Bill Grealy was my responsibility, - I lost him, Greg. - So what? You're human. I gotta make good on this call, Greg. Why's that? Because it's my last. Okay, team, we're at an emotional ground zero here, full circle. No one's gonna be thinking rationally today. Okay, Wordy, boss, you go in stealth, green wall. Sam? Jules, go black. I'll cover the catwalk. Ed, we're stretched thin, can you cover red wall? You got it. Spike, down to the wire here. Anything else you can get about Pippy and Jean-Paul? I told him that all that talk would just drag Pippy down. I begged him to move on, but he couldn't. Do you see this? Not a single mention of the trial. Oh wait! Not in the paper, not on the radio! Like it never happened. Oh, because God forbid people should think we have a race problem here. We might lose tourists. You see? He just wanted to go away. I just... I miss him. I know. I miss him. I miss him too. I miss him... I miss him... I have to ask if Pippy or your husband, do you think they may be capable of killing officer Grealy? Don't make me answer that. Take it. Take it! Let's talk. Get on your knees. No. Get on your knees, dammit! Mr. Buteau? I'm Sergeant Parker, Police Strategic Response Unit. Leave us alone! This has nothing to do with you! They're just going to let him go. We're here to make sure no one gets hurt, sir. Don't listen to them, they've done nothing for Luc. You think Luc would like to see you ruin your life by what you're about to do. My life ended a year ago, right here. What about Pippy's life? You fire that gun, you'll send her to jail. You want to make that bright young girl an accessory to murder? I don't care! Do it! Oh, for God's sake, do it! Finish it! If you're gonna do it, do it! Mr. Buteau: Shut up! Greg, I think you got another angle here. No, he's protecting Pippy, Eddie. I know what he's going through. Where he's at is not where he started when he left the courthouse. Sam, you got the shot? I got him. All right, go in. Standing down. Hey, Bill? Is there something you need to say here? I don't want to hear his excuses! If you take one more step, I swear to God I'll shoot him. Jean-Paul, it's not difficult to shoot the uniform. Are you sure you're ready to shoot the man? Bill, earlier today, you said you never got the chance to speak for yourself, so... I've heard his damn stories before. Not the whole story. Bill, you were surrounded by lawyers telling you what to say, when to say it. You gotta forget all that and in your own words just... Just tell 'em what happened. Everybody knows what happened. Everybody saw it right there on the security video! Before that. Did you tell them about the three people who were shot next door and how you caught a glimpse of a young man running away? Did you tell them that part? He fit the murderer's description. Because he was black. He was here, in the greenhouse, after hours, dressed as the suspect. He saw me and he tried to run. How did you feel when you saw him? Scared. Police! Stay where you are! I went my entire career without using my gun. Twenty years... I turned the corner and there he was. I smelled gunpowder. I didn't hear a shot. I thought he'd shot me, but it was me that shot him. I pulled the trigger and I killed him. I didn't know. Your son... thought he was in trouble because he stole a flower. And I shot him, in the dark, because I was scared. You were scared. I get that, Bill. You were scared. And that fear turns to anger. And you threw that at your job, and at your wife, and at yourself... Because it is easier than facing the guilt. It is easier than facing your feelings. I get it. Yeah. The lawyers.... Internal investigations... My wife... I never told anyone what your son was doing here that night. I'm so sorry. Look, Pippy. He came to get an orchid for your project. Get outta my way! Wait, wait a minute! Wait! Jean-Paul, she needs you. It's over, Pippy. I'm not going anywhere. It's okay. It's gonna be fine, Pippy. Wordy. Let me just talk to him for a sec. Yeah, Eddie. Guys. How's the arm doing, Bill? How do you do it? What do you mean? How long you been on the job? Nineteen years. Well, then you know what I mean. Well, you know, it's never what you think it's gonna be when they give you the badge, that's for sure. People glad to see you. Rescuing cats from trees. Well, they're not always happy to see you, right? I shot a... I shot a kid. I know. He was just a boy. I know. I know. He wasn't supposed to be there that night. You're human. That's all there is to it. I can't do this anymore. We are catching people in the worst moments of their lives, Bill - the very worst moment. And what've they got if they don't have us? I wanna thank you for giving me that shot today. Hey, least I could do given your plans. You know, about that, I, uh... Greg, that day I was shot and Izzie was born, I just thought how lucky I was... And how easy everything can be taken away, and I made them promise. I hear ya. I came into the station to honor that promise and I was gonna step down from team one. You were or you are? Eddie? Good job, today. Sophe, it was a routine escort. I thought I was gonna be an hour and a half. I didn't mean to keep you waiting. I'm sorry. It's okay. When I heard the action on the radio, I was praying to God that you weren't... You weren't on the call, but... But for their sake I'm glad you were. So listen up. Yeah? Optional overtime? - Gone. - Two hour pre-shift workout? At home with Izzie. All extracurricular conferences, SWAT team competitions? Totally at your discretion. Your discretion. Off-shift days? Full-time baby duty. So I can go back to work and start my own catering business. Starting own business... Mm-hm. Deal breaker. Done. Your daddy's a rock star. Yeah, that's what they say. Yeah. Cutie, cutie. Go.
