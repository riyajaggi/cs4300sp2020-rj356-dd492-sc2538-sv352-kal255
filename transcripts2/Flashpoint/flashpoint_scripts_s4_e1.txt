 Flashpoint (2008–2012): Season 4, Episode 1 - Personal Effects - full transcript 
 In the aftermath of the Season 3 Cliffhanger, at SRU Headquarters, Greg receives a devastating phone call that a member of Team One has been shot: It's Ed. Dr. Toth refuses to let Greg go because he doesn't believe Greg is fit for Duty. After closing the case, Dr. Toth clears Team One for Duty, but he tells Greg that he needs to be more of a leader and not a friend. Meanwhile, Ed risks his recovery to be with his wife, who is having problems delivering their baby.

 We've got somebody else to do your team's psychological evaluation this year. Who's Toth? Military psychologist. He breaks up teams. He does not break up teams. Oh, come on. He's a specialist in team psychology. We've had some tough calls. You lose your best friend, it's three in the afternoon, how do you spend the rest of your day?

 I went home. Today your friend dies, tomorrow my son dies. You patch things up with your father? No. Why not? 'Cause he won't. Why? He's dying. Spike. He won't patch things up until I quit SRU. You and Jules Callaghan were involved, did you know the risk to the team? Yes, I knew the risk to team. That's why I broke it off. There's a reason that's against SRU policy - it puts your teammates in danger.

 But it makes no difference because it's over. When was the last time you had a full medical? My last medical was fine. How do explain your trouble with concentration, your unsteady hands, your slower cognitive response? This job is the only thing I know how to do. Raise your arms. When things get tough at work where do you turn? I count on my team. Where do you turn if there's something that you can't share with the team? My family. So how're you coping with them gone? Greg, how'd he know that Sophie left me? I didn't trust myself to be objective, Eddie, as a colleague or as a friend. As a friend? Eddie. You know what, gentlemen? I got a baby I gotta meet. Yeah, put her on right now. Soph? What's going on? It's the baby, she's not doing that well. Her heart rate's low. She's not getting enough oxygen. What do you mean her heart's too slow? Sophie! No, Soph... Come on, buddy! I needed fresh eyes on my people. I didn't need you to break 'em down. Your instinct was right; There are fault lines running all through this team. What you call fault lines, that's them being human. It's natural that you're feeling protective. We had a record number of high-risk calls the past two years. I know you're team's numbers. These guys chose each other. They've got each other's back! I know. There's gotta be a good reason to break up the team. Come on! I'm telling you that you do not need to do this, all right? Listen to me, I need a bit more time. Come on! It's green! Go around! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Please?! Please?! All right, back in the car. Let's move the vehicle, please. Let's do it now!

Your team's not cleared for duty. Then clear 'em for duty, I have a man down. Sergeant Parker- Winnie! Can you stay objective? Are you saying his team is fit for duty? I'm saying this team has a man down. Can you stay objective? I know how to do my job. Winnie, recall team one. Thank you. Team three'll ride shotgun. And I'll be watching. Parker, keep your comm channel open. Okay, winnie, get him a headset. Yes, sir. Page 'em. I want my people. I'm already on it. I thought you said you wanted to break up this team. Let's see. You're right. About what? It's not gonna go away. So... So... Wow. Um... Okay, sorry. I'm gonna go. Hey, no, Jules. I gotta go. - Sam! - Jules! Jules! What's going on? We're cleared for duty? For now. Officer down. It's Ed. What? Sargent is on his way to the hospital. Donna. Witnesses say that the shooter is white male, thirties, dark pants, dark jacket. You get an ID on the car? Yeah, we got a plate and an address, and we're headed there now. That's great. How you doing there, buddy? He's in shock. Then talk to me, doc. Winnie, boost the volume, please. He took seven bullets, most to the chest and abdomen. They hit his vest. He has major bruising and he's lost a lot of blood. His arm? Two bullets. It's the one I'm worried about. Ulnar nerve damage. We've gotta get him into an O.R. as soon as possible. Page the surgeon. This surgeon... Dr. brown. Don't worry, he's the best. Here that, buddy? You're gonna be okay. Sophie... His wife... I already checked. She's in maternity, two floors up. She was in labor. She's had a downturn. But we've got a team working on her. What do you mean, downturn? I'm sorry, that's all I know. I'm sorry. - Boss... - It's okay, buddy. I'm gonna find out what's going on here. Sergeant Parker, your priority. Greg... Gimme a minute, will you? Don't worry, I'm done. Give him 10 mils of morphine, and get the pre-op started... Just keep me posted, please. - Will do. - Boss... Hey. You hang tight, you get some rest. We got a plate, we're gonna get this guy. I thought of something. Somebody else in the backseat. A woman. Military uniform. Military uniform? Team, call Downsview base. Got it, boss. Possible hostage. That's when he shot you? Okay. We're on it, buddy. We're on it. And, Ed, about before, with Toth... Don't worry about it. Let's just get this done. Just what I was thinking. Boss, there's a shooting at Downsview base. Two soldiers hit. One female, she's missing. We're on our way. Let's get this son of bitch off the street. Sync by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com C.O. says shots were fired at 16:50. We'll need visitor and vehicle entry logs. Corporal, which way? Private Michaels, you've got a call at the office. Private Michaels to the office. Jules, can we talk? Don't worry about it, Sam. I apologize. I didn't even think to ask if you were seeing somebody. That was Natalie. She seems really nice. My sister Natalie. Right. Natalie. She showed up last night. She's gonna crash with me for a little while. Personal reasons. Maybe it's for the best. What do you mean? Private Jordan? Jules Callaghan. This is Sam braddock. Strategic response unit. There it is. Civilian SUV exiting 16:54. You just shot two people, you take the time to sign out? If you don't wanna attract attention. Signed out 16:54, signed in 16:36. Guys, we've got a name. Shane Devlin. Shane Devlin, got it. I'll run the name. How's the hand? It's awesome. How's yours? What'd he say? What did who say? Dr. Toth, what did he say about my hand? When? Your psych assessment - you went right after me - what'd he say? You were looking at it, just now. Why, what's up with your hand? Nothing's wrong with my hand, it's just... Dr. Toth, he's just... He's messing with me. Okay. Donna, you find him? This address has nothing to do with this shooter. Now how's that? Well, unless he's crashing with a couple of vietnamese senior citizens... Stolen license plates? That's what I'm thinking. Could you check it out please? I'll check and I'll get back to you. How're you doing, private? I'm okay. Looks like you got lucky. Yeah. Bullet went right through. Where's Keefler? Is she all right? We're going to find her but we need your help. Okay? Can you tell us what happened? Meg Keefler was showing me the ropes. What's your position here? As of today? Mortuary affairs specialist. The man who shot you? Shane Devlin. He was here to retrieve the personal effects of his brother Richard Devlin. Corporal Devlin was killed in Afghanistan. I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Devlin. Your brother was a- Well, it's just a formality, sir. Hat' you doing? No. What's he doing? We usually, uh... We have to do a final inventory of the contents before we can release the locker. Okay, well, you can't just do that, okay? These are Richard's items, they're personal, have some respect! Sir, I'm very sorry about the circumstances- no, no! No, this is his stuff. This is completely unacceptable! Jeffrey... Please excuse us. Jeffrey, listen. This is an emotional day for any family member. I know. I get that. I'm respecting that. Yes, but this guy's obviously deeply upset. So I think we should let this on go. I'm not cutting corners. This is protocol, right? It's hard for him, it's hard for everyone else. We still got do our jobs. Mr. Devlin, you're free to observe. You'll see that we completely respect your brother's privacy. Richard gave his life, okay? He gave his life! This is not okay! When I came to, I called for help. No one responded to the gunshots? It's a military base, we hear gunshots all the time. When we got here, corporal keefler was gone. So was the locker. She got in the way, last second. You get a chance to see what was in the locker? Maybe it's something the brother didn't want you to see. No. You can get him out of school and ask him. What do you mean? The late Richard Devlin does have a brother named Shane. He's 11-years-old. What? Our guy's an impostor. And he went to a hell of a lot of trouble to get his hands on that locker. Have you ever been treated for an irregular heart beat? No. Do you have high blood pressure? No. Dad, what happened? Are you okay? Oh, I don't know. Ay, I'm okay. They won't tell me anything. Mr. Lane, we're gonna get you something for the pain, okay? 'Kay, no. You know what? Just tell me how my wife's doing? - Mr. Lane? - Lay back, Mr. Lane. Dad, just... Give me the chair. Mr. Lane, the longer we wait the lesser your chance of a full recovery. Look, I wasn't here when my son was born. I promised my wife I'd be here today. So are you gonna help me or not? Can you go get the wheelchair? Boss, I've got Donna. Patch her in to the team. Go ahead, Donna. Okay, baby steps here. There was a mass theft of license plates about a week ago. The job is connected to a drug dealer named Neil Cavell. I know this guy, wordy. He's an up-and-comer. Awesome. We tried to get him down when I was undercover at drug squad and couldn't do it. What's Cavell into? Heroin. There's your Afghanistan connection. You think this is Cavell we're after? No. Ed's shooter does not match the description, but it could be one of his guys. Okay, lean on your contacts at drug squad. Yeah, I will. How is he? Couple broken ribs, lost a lot of blood... He'll be good. He'll be good. What aren't you saying, boss? Possible nerve damage in his arm. It's too soon to tell. So, drugs? Smuggled in a dead soldier's locker. Dr. Sergeant Parker... Yes, Dr. Toth. I've worked with soldier's families. I know a thing or two about the chain of grief. Well, how does a civilian get access to a soldier's belongings? He doesn't. The delivery follows a strict chain of custody protocol. The deceased's items are examined, prepared and inventoried overseas, transported by locker under strict supervision, and then stored at the depot until they're released to a family member after a second inspection. So if you wanted to arrange a drug shipment, you'd bypass civilian border inspection, which is smart... All you'd need is an accomplice inside. Let's check the duty roster. Eddie! What happened?! I'm okay. I'm right here. Why's she in pain? The anesthetist's on his way. Sophie... Sophie... You're gonna be okay. Sniper breathing, like we practiced, okay? Breathe in, breathe in. Hold... Out. That's it, baby. That's it. In... And out... That's it. Good. Good. That's it. Thanks. All right, today is Meg Keefler's shift. She runs it alone. She's definitely knew that the locker was coming in. Then they gave her private Jordan to train. Keefler said to "let this one go," but he wouldn't. He's the reason things went off the rails. So the gunman didn't abduct keefler for leverage. He took her 'cause she was wounded. Because she's in on it. So the gunman didn't fire at Meg keefler, not on purpose. Yeah, she got in the line of fire. She's wounded. He's probably looking for help. Your partner's shot, where would you go? Not the hospital. A colleague, a friend he trusted... Captain Qadir. Who? Jani Qadir. She's a doctor. She and keefler served together, they're friends. Sophie, breathe in, 2, 3, 4, hold... And out... Eddie, you gotta let them help you. I'm okay. I'm okay. Breathe in. She's still at five centimeters. Mrs. Lane? Sophie? We're gonna do the c-section, all right? As soon as the anesthetist has you set up- On her side. What's going on? We've lost readings on the baby. We need to get the baby back in the position. It's okay, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. Police! Show us your hands! Hands in the air! Do it now! The man who brought you here, where is he?! The house is clear. He's not here. Look, I realize you've been shot, corporal, but I need answers now. How're you doing? I'm fine. The man who brought you here, he's making some dangerous choices right now. We need to find out where he is. You know him. We know you're involved. Meg, talk. Who do you think you're helping by not talking? Meg, neither of you is walking away from this. This guy you think you're protecting is on a very destructive path. We can help him. You give us his name. His name's Colin Potter, he's my husband. He's your husband. Where'd he go? I don't know. Did he mention the name Cavell? Neil Cavell? Meg, do you wanna help your husband? Neil Cavell. Yes. Is that who he's meeting? Yes. He didn't tell me where. Okay, keep talking to her. - Donna. - Yeah, boss? Gunman's name is is Colin Potter. He's on his way to meet Cavell. You get anything from drug squad? Ah, he lives in Parkdale but he conducts after hours meetings at his brother's trading company at 2336 Dundas street east. Okay, let's get a head start. Keep listening. You know, you get Colin to talk about Cavell, that would be the first solid piece of evidence we have on the guy. You'd make drug squad's day. Yeah, I don't give a damn about their day. Just get there, fast. - Boss? - What? Do you want my team to handle this? We'll meet you there, Donna. Okay, but- Go! Observe and maintain distance, all right? We need to know our players better before we join the game, that's what we're doing right now, you copy me? Yup. Loud and clear. Colin's a war correspondent. He was on assignment in Afghanistan. He came back, but it wasn't Colin really. He'd changed. To get the stories he needed over there hey, hey... He got close to his sources. He worked those relationships. Trust - a favor for a favor. Yeah, I mean, he'd seen some disturbing things over there and everyone copes their own way. Colin's always been impulsive, addictive... And it turns out that some of those sources he made friends with... Drug traffickers. They got him on opium first... And then heroin, and then whatever he could get his hands on. And those friends kept enabling him, a favor for a favor. I'm sorry, megs. Don't be sorry. It's over. We'll get you help. It's not over! What do you mean? I owe them money! But they're 10,000 miles from here. They have people here; They'll find me. They'll find us. I need your help, megs. They had someone on the inside in Afghanistan and they needed someone on the receiving end, someone who could turn a blind eye. They said that if we don't do this, they're gonna come after you. After me? They know I don't care what happens to me and I don't, megs, I don't. I don't care at all. But I can't let them hurt you. Look, can we just do this? Just this one time? Just this one time and my debt to them is gone. And then I will get help, and we will go back to the way things were. But you have to believe me. It won't work if you don't. Do you believe me? I believe you. It's okay. It's okay. I believe you. What could I say? What else could I do? But something went wrong. We know. No, not today at the warehouse. I mean on the shipping end. Look under the blanket. The hidden compartment was empty! Someone must've intercepted the drugs before the locker left kabul. Colin freaked. We told him he could explain, tell the guys that it's not his fault. But he was high, paranoid, he wasn't listening. He said there's no way they'd believe him. But he went anyway. Empty-handed? Why? Because they know where we live. He's already shot three people today trying to keep this appointment. Maybe he thinks the only way out now is kill the bad guys first. Donna, you listening? Yep. If he shows up without the drugs, that's not gonna go over well. Any sign of him yet? No. Nor Cavell. Our priority's to keep them apart. Colin's under the influence, emotionally impulsive, and he's up against guys who can aim. And that would be a bad thing. Sergeant, how are you doing? Team, you heard Jules. "Connect, respect, protect." Winnie, unis and an e. M.T. To this address. Copy that. Thank you, Meg. Please, please don't let them hurt him. We'll let you know as soon as he's safe. In through the nose, that's it. That's good. Out slow... Slow... You're doing so good. You're so good. So good. Ow... That's it, two, three, four. Sophie, hold on. That's it, baby! You're doing good. Mr. Lane, don't stop. There's internal bleeding. Anything you can do to help slow her pulse. Sophie, you remember that night just before we got married, out in the hammock, just lying there and rockin' and swinging... The baby's heart rate is 93 BPM. Still too low. The mother's is too high. We have to get the baby out now. Mr. Lane, we gotta get you outta the way. Come on. It's okay, Sophie. Please, sir, you have to leave. I love you. No! Ed! She's bleeding again. Mrs. Lane, we need you to stay calm. Ed! Team three, we're here. What do you got? Drug squad's undercover across the street. Your guy just entered the building. Which office does Cavell use? It's not an office, it's an executive lounge. 10th floor, red wall. Okay, we'll take the stairs. We got a TAC plan worked up on Cavell. Drug squad's gonna watch him from the outside, we're gonna take him down in the lobby. This the lounge? Yeah. It's a big room, it's exposed glass. - Where gonna need to know where he is. - I got it covered. - Copy that. Go careful, Donna. Get your man, boss. Heading into position one floor down. - Clear? - Yeah. - Spike? - I'm underneath. You remember what I said about this whole getting married thing? "How do we know for sure?" Remember what you said? "We don't. It's a mystery. "We don't know for sure till it's over." And you said, "the thing about getting married is, Is who you wanna face the mystery with? I got him. He's on the move in there. Black wall. Copy. Let's take down the door. Police! SRU! Drop your weapon! SRU! SRU! Hands in the air! Drop your weapon and show us your hands now! Put your hands in the air now! Drop your weapon! Spike, he went through a door that wasn't on the map. I'm on it. Drop your weapon! Do it now! Get back! Don't! Don't! Stay back! I've got vantage and concealment. Wordy, lay low, hold fire. Spike, you're Sierra. Copy that. Wordy, you're my eyes. Hey, Colin... Hey, Colin, I'm Greg Parker. I'm with the police strategic response unit. What do you say we talk, huh? Body language... Looks like he's gonna jump. Look, I know what happened today. And I know you were trying to... You were trying to do what you thought you had to do; That, uh... That you didn't think you had another choice. That you were worried about Meg, right? I did exactly what I had to do. I didn't have a choice. Hey... Col... Don't! Okay! Okay! I'm not coming any closer, buddy. Boss, he's past negotiation. He shot a cop and a soldier. I don't think he's seeing the happy ending here. Boss, if we wanna stop a suicide, the only way's a double drop. We'd have him on the ground before he knew what hit him. Staging area looks good. A double-drop, 10 floors up. What's your take on that move? I don't like it. It's risky, but it's in the playbook? Yes. What would you do? Judgment call. It's never black or white. Yes, but what would you do? I wouldn't risk my team. Unless you had something to prove... Boss, I'm not seeing another option. So I gotta risk my team to save the guy who shot my tl seven times. It's your call, boss. I'm so sorry. 'Kay, Sam, let's do it. You gotta keep him still. I'm gonna try to keep his focus on me. Just give us the word. I've fallen, and I love you so much, baby. All right, we got one shot at this, guys. His instincts are primal, we time this wrong, give him time to react, he's gonna take you down with him. Sergeant Parker, I can't let you do this. Your team was a breath away from being disbanded. Excuse me? You're risking their lives to prove something to me. Are you kidding me? This is the job. This is what we do. Nothing changes. Team one. Anyone wants to stand down, the choice is yours. Spike? Present and on board. - Wordy? - Not going anywhere. - Jules? - I'm good. Sam? Nowhere in the world I'd rather be. There's your answer, Dr. Toth. Copy that, sergeant Parker. Sophie, you hang on. Hang on. Sophie, hang on. Standing by in position, boss. Hey, Colin? I'm having trouble understanding what you're saying, buddy, can you repeat that? Wordy, what do you see? He's pacing. We gotta keep him still. Wordy, Jules and Sam, they're in your hands. Copy. Soph, you remember what happened next? Baby... It was so quiet. There's no moon, no crickets, and you said, "Eddie, it's not like there's gonna be some kind of a sign..." Doctor, there we go. I can see the baby's head. Nice and easy. Ready? Here we go. Colin! I really don't... Colin! Hey, look at me! Look at me, buddy. Are you thinking about Meg? Is she okay? Yeah, she's okay. She's with her friend right now, you want me to send a message to her. 'Cause she's safe. But you're here, how is she safe? Boss has his attention, take two steps to your right. She's with her friend, buddy. And you said, "Eddie, it's not like... There's gonna be a sign, some kind of sign. "That everything's gonna be all right." Here we go. She's a girl. Oxygen. Respiratory distress. You have to keep her safe. I promise, we'll keep her safe. What do you want me to tell her? Sinuses. We're gonna have to aspirate. Let's get these airways clear. But there was, there was a sign. Sophie, there was. You remember? Fireflies. Fireflies. On three, two... Just tell her goodbye. Go, go, go! Gun clear. Up, up! 6:54 P.M., subject secure. Good work, team one. Team one, subject secure. Copy that. Team three, status? Flawless team three take down in the lobby. Cavell is in custody, drug squad is very happy to have their evidence. That's good work, Donna. Miracle of modern technology. I spotted cavell, called him on his cellular, distracted him with my undercover skank voice, and, uh, we took him down. Can I hear your undercover skank voice? Someday, Spikey. Someday. Okay, I'll see you guys back at the barn? Somewhere we gotta be first. I'll be there as soon as I can. And we looked up and we saw fireflies. Thousands of 'em. And we knew everything was gonna be okay. And I made a promise to your mom and now I'm gonna make a promise to you... A time like this and you choose to come here? Thank you. I don't like unfinished business. I appreciate that. I'll be fast. To be blunt, I still question your objectivity. But the events of the day and your team's professionalism under intense and extreme personal pressure has not gone unnoticed. I'm clearing them for duty. Thank you. Conditionally. Conditionally. You're on probation. Wordsworth needs a full medical, asap; Scarlatti, a decision about his commitment to the team; Julianna Callaghan and Sam braddock, if their relationship crosses the line again, violating the priority of life code, immediate disciplinary measures and reassignment - for them and for you. They're in your command; You're responsible. I'll be watching. Every case file, every transcript will be copied to my office.
