 Clay woke up. - Oh. - Henry. - Are you okay? Henry? - I have to go. - Oh, my God. - Henry? I'm sorry. Are you okay? I can't... I can't... I can't breathe. Jenna, get back! Did you guys hear that? It sounded like an explosion! Was that a gunshot? Holy shit! This is crazy!

 Evacuation protocol now! - Henry? Let's get out of here. Holy shit. Where did she go? I-I don't know. - Did she do this? - Just shut up, okay? Attention all faculty and students... Please evacuate the building immediately. Maybe we should tell them there wasn't a bomb. No, no, Townes, you can't say anything to anyone, okay? As quickly and orderly as possible. We need to get out of here. Come on. Go. Fuck.

 Hello? Thomas? What are you doing here? I asked you a question. I... I don't know. Are you high? No, Mom, I'm not high. Did you have another seizure? No, I just forgot my homework. I have a test, so I should probably go. Why didn't you tell me you were in that car accident with Clay Boone? Who told you that? Why did you leave him there? Were you embarrassed? Are you... are you two dating? Why would you think that? Why? It's nothing to be ashamed of! - It's fucking typical of you. - Hey, hey, wait! Henry, wait. Would you please stop? What the hell else am I supposed to think? You won't talk to me about anything! What's the point? It's not gonna change anything. - Maybe it would! - No, no, no. I can't! I can't keep doing this with you! It is not fair! I'm alone! I am completely alone here, and it is because of you. It is your fault. Do you not see that? Do you not, like, see anything that you do to me at all? Then you stand there and you think that I had sex with Clay? - Are you fucking serious? - I never said... You are the one who sleeps around! Okay, come back here right now! - Get back here right now! - Just fucking leave me alone! You cannot talk to me that way! Dominick? You grew up in the inner city, right? Just the city, sir. You ever have any shit like this go on in your school? No. All students and faculty please stay outside of the building but on school grounds. All right, Eileen, what do you got? There was an explosion, and the manual said to evacuate, but maybe we should've gone into lock-down. - Is the building clear now? - It should be. Bomb squad will be here in 20 minutes. Nobody goes in until we give the okay, understood? - Yes, Sheriff. - All right. Oh, shit. They got that big Lincoln game coming up, don't they? Pretty aggressive prank. Yeah, well, you should see some of the crap these kids have pulled. Yeah. Henry, wait! Henry! Henry! I saw what you did! Townes, I can't talk to you right now. - Henry... - Townes, I do not have time - for this shit. - Are you okay? You experienced another episode, right? You told Townes? He figured it out. Your telekinesis has gotten much stronger. Did you want to crush the bathroom with your mind? - No. - Telekinesis isn't a thing in life or in science. No, I had... I don't know. I had, like, a panic attack. And I couldn't breathe, and my vision went out, and shit started to come towards me, and then I was in my bedroom, so... Instantaneously? Yeah. This changes everything. I... I need my books! Meet me at my house in 34 minutes. Do you remember the address? Townes, we're not going to your stupid... "Even the imagination has a limit, "a point at which our best creations "meet our worst fears. We are about to exceed that limit." Come on, I'll take you home. I really thought that medication would help. Maybe it still can. I need to talk to him. Who, Clay? Yeah. I need to know what he knows. And I need him to understand exactly what happened before this gets out and gets, like, all... distorted or some... And you deserve that, but what happens if you confront him... Jenna, it doesn't matter. He could tell, like, Lucas or his dad, I mean, you have no idea how fucking dangerous they are, Jenna. Can you take me to Townes's house? Henry! Townes has no idea what the hell he's talking about. I need to talk to Clay, and for that to happen, I need to understand what the fuck is going on with me. So, unless you have some better idea, can you just please drive? I can't take your call right now, but leave a message, and I'll call you back. Hey, Pop. Just wondering where you're at. Clay's asking for you. Call me back. Dad says he's on his way. So how'd it go with the doctor? You want some water? Well, how about a snack or something? Lucas, I know what they said. But I'm telling you, I can feel my legs, all right? 'Cause they hurt. And they wouldn't hurt if I couldn't feel them. No, they... they wouldn't. Okay, well... I'll tell them that, and I'll make sure that they listen, okay? Okay. ♪ Let's start writing our own history ♪ ♪ Let's take this road ♪ Hey, Jake, could you grab Thomas for me, please? - Sure thing, Ms. Coles. - Thank you. Hi. I don't know if you remember me. Um, I'm Cleo Coles from the diner. I'm Thomas Hope's girlfriend, and, uh... I just... I wanted to say... how sorry I am about Clay. He woke up today. Oh, that's, um... that's great. How's he doing? I don't know. I got the call, and, uh... I ended up here. He had a real shot of getting out of this town, you know? Syracuse and Connecticut were already scouting him. Coming up on 13 years. Long time to go without a drink. Be a shame not to make it to 13... being such a lucky number and all. Hey, what, uh... what was that? Oh, I was asking him about Clay. I thought it was the right thing to do, since Henry was in the car with him the night of the accident. But you knew that already, right? Really? Nothing? I did what I thought was right. Oh, okay. And I'm not gonna apologize for trying to protect your kid. Protect my... Are you fucking kidding me? - Hey... - Where do you get off? How would you feel if I kept secrets about Jenna from you? - Okay. Hey! - Would you like that? I get it, okay? I do. But with you, Cleo, it's always yours or mine. Right? We live together now. Don't you think that we should be... We should... we should try to parent together? Oh, why would you think that? We've been together, like, a couple of months. Four months! And moving in was your idea! Okay, well, clearly, we rushed things, because Henry was certainly not ready. This has nothing to do with Henry. This is all about you, Cleo. You haven't even unpacked. Can we please not go over this again? Why do you feel the need to be ready to go - at a moment's notice? - I don't! - What are you so afraid of? - Nothing! I am not afraid of anything! I don't even know why I bother, Cleo. We both know I'm gonna come home some night - and you're both gonna be gone. - Okay. And, fuck, you're packed already. - Oh, fuck off! - You know what? You first. - You first! - Okay, fine. Shit. Why even bother knocking? I thought my friend would open the door. You should not be here. - I come bearing gifts. - No, I don't want whatever... - Are those Przystanek? - Krakow's finest. What do you want? I paid a visit to everyone on your list. No one will talk. Well, everyone's a paid employee. If they'd rather die than talk, well... Oh, yeah. That's fucking delicious. There was a man this last time. He knew I was coming. And he had this. It emitted a sound that prevented me from traveling, at least, in the way I'm used to. - If I can find him, then... - No. - All I'm asking... - No. - Is for you to take a look... - No. See if you know where it came from. Please, Sam. I have nowhere else to go. You know, Townes is good at science. Not great. Sometimes he gets a bit confused about which is science and which is fiction. For not liking the guy, you sure know a lot about him. Jenna Faith Hope. It's been a minute. Faith? Your middle name is Faith? Shut up. This is Henry. She's not my friend. Hey. Meghan. Come on in. Faith Hope. Holy shit, I can't believe they thought that was a good idea. Townes, you got company. He mentioned he might have friends over, but he's thought that before, and... Anyway, I'm trying to think of the last time I saw you. Yeah, uh, I don't know. How's high school? It's school. Jenna's very popular. - Are you home on break? - Yeah, but being back sucks. I kind of found my people in college, and Reston, well... - You know. - Totally. You came. And you're right on ti... Or... Actually, you're two minutes early. After you. Tell me exactly what happens. I get this feeling... like the world starts to pull away, and then my hearing goes out, and suddenly I'm in my bedroom. Always to your bedroom? Yeah, every time. Is there anything specific you feel? I'm looking for a pattern. Um... It sometimes happens if somebody gets too close to me. Before my mom knew I didn't like to be touched, she'd hug me and hug me and hug me. She thought that that's what I was missing, but hugs can hurt. They can... Actually, they can feel a lot like fire. It happens when you're scared, too, right? When I told you about Clay waking up, you... But, uh, I don't... I don't know. I could be wrong. No, fear's interesting. It motivates a lot of behavior. I think I know what's going on and possibly how to control it, but in order to prove my theory, we need to induce another event. You want to scare the shit out of me? Why? To prove you can teleport. - Townes... - That's impossible. Scientists have only been able to teleport elementary particles, and even then, they're just copies of the original. Then maybe Henry's making copies of herself every time she teleports. Maybe this isn't even the original Henry. I mean, it would make more sense if you were generating a wormhole. - Like a singularity? - A naked singularity. What? What the fuck is a single-naked wormhole? What are you talking about? And since when did you become such a huge nerd, Jenna? It's like you're leading a double life. A wormhole is a black hole, like in space. But one you can travel through. Well, theoretically, but the amount of mass it takes to create one is insane. But what if fear has mass? No, emotions don't have mass. This is fucking bat shit. This is nuts! Right? It kind of explains why the bathroom imploded. Energy was drawn toward you. And you always end up back in your bedroom, which is arbitrary to physics, but unique to you. And this makes sense to you? In a completely "detached from reality" way, yes. But it's all theoretical until we test it. Then let's scare the shit out of me. No, I can't. - No fucking way. - Henry, wait! Jenna, there is no fucking way that I'm gonna jump off that thing. - No! - Henry, just... It's not fair! And what if it doesn't work? There's such a good chance that it just, like, won't work, Jenna. But if... if we're right, your body won't even let you hit the water. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck me. Whoa. Stupid fucking... Shit! Actually, this was very helpful. Disproving theories is just as important as proving them. Fuck off, Townes. Maybe you can go warm up the car. What am I gonna do now? What if I go talk to Clay? Patty's already at the hospital with some of Clay's friends. I could find out what he remembers, if anything. Okay? ♪ Give me the music ♪ Betty, can I get a Scotch? Preferably something that doesn't taste like a campfire. - Where's Thomas? - Not here. Oh. One of those kind of days, huh? Thanks. ♪ Everybody dance now ♪ I mean, I'd apologize, but it's Marky Mark. Marky Mark? That's not... That's C+C Music Factory. No, it's not. It's Marky Mark. I'm positive. My band used to do a country cover of it. You did this country style? Uh, yeah, it's a choice. ♪ Here is the dome, back with the bass ♪ ♪ The jam is live in effect, and I don't waste time ♪ ♪ Off the mic with a dope rhyme ♪ ♪ Jump to the rhythm, jump, jump to the rhythm, jump ♪ Boom. Well, are you guys performing tonight? - I mean, I'd love to see you. - Uh-huh. No, we're not. We broke up a long time ago. But I'll sing along to anything on the jukebox for a two-drink minimum. That's one. Good afternoon. Can I help you? Yeah, I uh... I need a wheelchair. My son is... Paralyzed. I see. Uh, can you tell me where on the spine the injury occurred? Uh, well, I don't... Does that matter? Well, believe it or not, it does. See, every chair is designed specifically to a person's injury. That one looks good. Uh, yes, that... that's a very good chair, but it might not be right for your son. See, if I know how much mobility he has, then we can refine your search. He's strong. He's an athlete. I see. Well, uh, if you'd like, I can get you a list of questions to ask your son's doctor, and then perhaps you can come back with those details... I'm here now. I can't see him without... We just want to be sure that we choose a chair that best fits his needs. Don't tell me what we want. Just give me that one! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Of course. Hey, Jenna. Glad you made it. Uh, me too. Hey. What's going on? Why is everybody out here? The nurses won't let us in. They said it's family only. It's total bullshit. Hey, do you guys want to sign Clay's card? Yeah. What are you doing here? Is Henry with you? She told me what you did to her. That's some psycho shit, putting a girl in the trunk of your car. I'm not psycho. You're lucky we didn't call the police. Well, then she'd have to explain what she did to my car, right? I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, this isn't a joke. My brother is a paraplegic. His life is over, and nobody seems to give a shit. Well, maybe it's his own fault. What did you just say? Just... stay away from Henry. She's been through enough. Here's one. I literally have no idea what that is. - Sing the hook so that I can... - That's it. That's the hook. That's the hook? It sounds like elevator music. That's "Think Twice" by Celine Dion. Okay, that's not even a real song. Come on. How can you say that? That was, like, a... That was a huge hit. That's not a hit. No, no. The song from "Titanic" was a huge hit. Whatever that is... Whatever you just sang, that's... that's a bonus track at Starbucks. Oh, my God, that's... You just broke Celine Dion's heart... - Yeah. - With that. Let me ask you something. Um... Do you know any decent restaurants nearby? My car's in the shop, and I'm kind of trapped in this town until I can get it fixed. What? Nothing. It's just, um... my car broke down here, too. And I never left. Mm. Well, I can see how this town could grow on you. Have dinner with me. I'm telling you, I can feel it. Okay. What exactly can you feel? Can you describe it to me? Shooting pains all up and down my leg. That means something. - Mm. - Right? Not necessarily. There he is. Dad. What is this? I'm not gonna need that thing, all right? I-I can feel my legs. Clay, that's not quite... What you're experiencing, it's called "phantom pain." Why don't you just get this out of here? What are you talking about? It's the nicest chair on the market. Yeah, but he's not gonna be able to get himself in and out of this fucking thing. If you'd been here, you would know that. Who the hell says he can't do that in this chair? Mr. Boone, perhaps we could talk about this another time? Can we please just go to the cafeteria - and let the nurse work? - I just got here! No, no, Lucas, it's fine. I want him to stay. You hear that? My boy wants me here. - Maybe you should leave. - No, that's not what I'm... Why do you need to be like this? Because I don't need you telling me what I can and can't do! Gentlemen, please, this is a hospital! Wait, something's wrong. - Oh, shit! Are you okay? - Look... look at his leg! - What? What's happening? - It's gonna be okay. What's happening? Why am I sweating? The hot coffee just spilled, and the sweat is your body's way of telling you that something is wrong. Now, maybe the two of you want to step outside until I'm done here... Thank you. - Wait. Why... - You're good. Why can't I feel it? - There we go. - Hey. - Hey. Why can't I feel it? - It's all good. Why can't I feel it? - Hey, Yvette. Hey. Didn't think I'd get you. - Then why'd you call? - Oh, be nice. I didn't get your RSVP, so I figured you're not coming to the party. But I wanted to double-check. Yeah... I... Yeah, I don't know. You're gonna have to come back home sometime. Folks will understand. Yeah, like Aunt Marie? Aunt Marie is a drunk with a trick hip and a forked tongue. Nobody listens to that woman. Just come. Ruby is dying to see her auntie. And Dad? All units, we have a 10-39, convenience store at Lakewood and Highway 68. Okay. Uh, I got to go. Hey, you're gonna let me know. Right? - I got to go! Unit 29 responding. Hey. So what happened? Did you see him? Nobody was allowed in. - Oh. What? - Lucas was there. I swear to God... There's too much testosterone in that family. - What did he do? - Nothing, but... Henry, Clay's a paraplegic. - Oh, I'm sorry, um... - No... But it is not your fault. Right? This never would've happened if Clay... He deserves it. Henry, talk to me. You should get that. No, it can wait. No, seriously, Jenna, get it. This is on me. This is my thing. I shouldn't have sent you to, like, deal with my shit. Seriously. I would rather be alone. Hey, Patty. Yeah, just give me a minute. ♪ You are the architect ♪ Hey, are you hungry? 'Cause I can... Henry? ♪ You are the architect ♪ ♪ Don't suffer yourself for the simple phrase ♪ ♪ Where crediting lines are the proof that you lose ♪ ♪ The blueprint you made has now taken shape ♪ ♪ The formula's stolen and patterns moved ♪ ♪ And then we fight we fall amidst it all ♪ ♪ We fight we fall and miss it all ♪ ♪ And then we fight we fall amidst it all ♪ ♪ We fight we fall and miss it all ♪ ♪ You are the architect ♪ ♪ The energy spent can't be replicated ♪ ♪ Visions in the sacred space not yours to choose ♪ Henry? Henry? Henry! Henry! Hello? Holy shit, Henry. Where are you? In my bedroom. It happened again. Yeah. We were right. It's fear. Why didn't you tell me? Because fear only works if you're... really alone. You know, if there's no safety net. It's like fight or flight, and if I can't fight, I think my body will protect me. I got to go. What are you gonna tell him? The truth. Unit 21, 10-9, 10-39 confirmed. My guess is an overdose. Been seeing a lot of junkies lately. He probably shot up in the bathroom and collapsed out here. Have you ever seen him before? I don't know. Maybe. - Hey. - Hey. Could you give me a hand with this box? Yeah. Seriously, it's, like, really heavy. - Oh, sorry. Sorry. - Thank you. - Wow. - I know. I've got, like, 20 more, so... Here, wait. Wait a second. Um... I'm... I am really sorry about what happened this morning. I-I never should've said what I said. I... And you were totally right. I... should've told you about Henry. Yeah, you should've. But you weren't completely wrong either. I'm not going anywhere, Thomas. Good. Hey. I, um... You're paralyzed. Are you okay? Lucas says you called 911. Do you remember what happened? I remember you were there. And we were kissing. And after that, uh... Yeah, I don't know. Do you remember? Yeah. We were in your truck, and you... Ow! Hey! Please, stop! You were... We were attacked... By these guys that work for your dad. They had, like, bats and clubs, and I just... I ran. What are you doing in here? Visiting hours are over. - You need to leave right now. - Okay. Henry. I'm glad you got away. Somebody grab him! Holy shit! What was that? - Somebody grab him! - Holy shit! What was that? Whoa. I don't know what to tell you, Dom. It's clean. There's no marking of any kind that I can... There should be an equalizer, though. Is, uh... is this all there is? Uh, I think... Here. Is that where the sound comes from? Shit! Fuck! Come on! It's a tracker, Dom. It's a fucking tracker. How long have you had this on you? Dom! How long? Sabine! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan! Dominick. It's late. Yeah. I was at the hospital, um, visiting Clay. How is he? He's okay. Henry. You shouldn't have talked to me like that earlier. I know, I'm sorry. You were right... about what I put you through. I'm trying to be better. I want you to know that. The way I felt about your dad was... Maybe I've been trying to chase that feeling. Maybe I feel safer if I move on from men before they have a chance to move on from me. I haven't been completely honest with you. Your father didn't leave me for another woman. But you've always said that he... I know. I know what I said. I just... I feel like now that you're older, you... You should know the truth. Do you want to sit down? You remember how I used to be in a band? Yeah. When you were about four, I went on tour. It wasn't like it was a tour tour. It was just a weekend away, but I was so excited. And when I came home... you were all alone... and you were crying. He just left you all by yourself. Your father just left you. I don't know. I know I'm not perfect. I know that. I know that more than you know, but I would never leave you, do you understand that? I'm here, whether you like it or not. Maybe we could just... we could make a pact. No more secrets. We tell each other the truth, even if it's hard. Okay. Come here. I love you, baby.
