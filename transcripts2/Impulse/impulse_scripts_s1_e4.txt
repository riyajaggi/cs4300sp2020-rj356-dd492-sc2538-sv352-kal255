 Esther and Jeremiah. Tight security. Well, when you make the best damn pickle relish in North America, you take precautions. Follow the road past the stables. The Millers will meet you at the second grain corridor. Thank you. What did he overdose on? It was a prescription painkiller called fentanyl. It's highly lethal, even in small doses. Where's his body now? It's at the Reston morgue. Why didn't you bring him back here? It's... I... It's not that simple, I'm afraid. Your son's body was found on American soil as part of an ongoing police investigation. Did you find my son? I was the first officer on the scene, yes. Did you try to save him? I'm sorry. There was nothing I-I could do. I need to bury him. Three days after his death. Do you understand? I do. I'm sorry. Will you just excuse me a moment? What? They found Amos Miller's car a couple blocks from the convenience store. Do you have access to border logs? Sure do. What are you looking for? I want to find out when Amos Miller crossed, and if he was alone. Oh, my God. Thank God you're awake. Why are you dressed like that? Do you know what time it is? I'm not going to school. It's family fun day. Okay, um... Well, listen, uh, I went to bed last night and I woke up somewhere else. Jenna. Do you know what I mean? Like, I... I teleported in my fucking sleep, like I went somewhere from my bedroom. Like, I woke up, and it was dark, and I'm pretty sure I heard footsteps, or maybe, like, a generator. I'm not 100% sure. I thought that we had this figured out. You know what I mean? And now it's changing. Like, this thing is changing, and I... I don't know if I can go back to sleep. Henry... I'm sorry, I really am, but I just... I need to get in there. What's wrong with you? What are you doing? What's going on? I'm baking. Okay, I can see that, but can you stop and help me figure this out, please? I can't help you, all right? Not today. But if you want to grab a whisk, you could help me bake. It's therapeutic. Promise. I'm not going to help you make fucking cookies. Well, then, I think you should leave. Fine. Fucking Christ. Have a great day. See you next time. There you go. Just take your time. Assholes. Ah, it's not worth the fight. Gotta save my energy for the dinner rush. You ever get a break from this place? These are the good shifts. I get it. I was a barback at The Lodge in high school. Hardest two weeks of my life. - Two weeks, huh? - Yeah. Listen, I, uh, wanted to say thank you for yesterday. Yeah, well, we never think these kind of things are gonna happen to our kids. Speaking of which, how's yours doing? Henry? Oh, she's all right. Yeah? She seems like a smart girl. Must take after her mom. Maybe. Anyway, I should get going. You didn't happen to grab the pie. You did. - Got you. - Thank you. All right, Bill. Let me get you your change. Keep it. It's a tip. Ah. Don't be ridiculous. I'll take 3 bucks. It's 20%. Listen, we should discuss other opportunities for you here in Reston. When you finish your shift, why don't you stop by the auto center? Cleo, order's up. Um, okay, yeah. Uh, thank you, I will. Great. Good. See you then. Okay. Now, let's take a closer look at the main characters. The torture of having to wait alone is too much for Vladimir. He needs to wake Estragon from his dream. Now, if we consider this relationship, we realize how selfish Vladimir is, unable to be alone. Essays are due on Thursday, everybody. No exceptions. Townes. I need to talk to you, but not here, so... Are you coming? You look terrible. Thanks. You smell bad, too. You've got a real way with words, Townes. Your hygiene has always been questionable, but the odor you're giving off today is particularly concerning. Yeah, well, I haven't slept, like, at all, so... Townes! Please, where are you going? I have to go to class. Seriously, I maybe got, like, two hours. Me too. Check out what I found. What? Holy shit. Can I? My God. Somebody grab him! Yeah, but there's, like, a hundred of these videos. Are you sure that it's not fake? This one's different, I think. I need to do more research about who these men are, but Henry, you may not be alone. I teleported in my sleep last night. What do you mean? Like, my subconscious took my body somewhere. I don't know. Whoa. Or someone summoned you to them. What? That's fucking terrifying, Townes. You sure it wasn't a dream? Well, I woke up in a confined space, I couldn't see shit, and I cut myself on something, so yeah, it didn't feel like a dream. Okay, well, maybe we can search for reported explosions - to narrow down your location. - No, I didn't... It wasn't... It wasn't, like, destructive. It was different. It was like... It was easier. It was just, like, my body drifted away. Right. Well, you were in a relaxed state. Your body wasn't under duress. Yeah, well, now it fucking is. I don't know how much longer I can stay awake. I'm fucking tired. And what happens if I go to sleep, Townes? I could literally end up anywhere. Can... Can you come over to my house? Like, just in case. You want me to watch you sleep? I guess, yeah. I mean, I need your help, so if you could... Like... so, like, as a... As a friend? Yeah. As a friend. A friend who knows about science and stuff. I can't do this alone, so... Meet me here after sixth period. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. I'm getting out of here. If you were smart, you'd do the same. He killed her. He took Tristan and he killed her. Dom, you just got to run. All right? You pack a bag you disappear. He told me where to find him. - I can get him back. - No, no. Dom, you can't, okay? It's a trap. You know that. That's why I need your help. No. They cut me open. You saw it. They'll do the same thing to Tristan. They have no reason to hurt him. There's no proof that teleportation is genetic. Tristan could be the proof. That's how they think. What is this place? Do you know? Yeah, yeah. It's another gravitational wave observatory. Like the one I was in. It's not dissimilar. You'd be a fucking idiot to go in there. Help me. Please. Fuck. Take care of yourself. Shit, shit, shit, shit. How much longer? Are you in a rush? Randy, The Lodge doesn't open for a little while. But they open early on pub quiz night. Found what you're looking for? Yeah, she's all yours. Officer Walker? I got some bad news. No record of the Miller kid crossing. I went back a couple of months to be sure. You get anything from the vehicle? Uh, it's a trap car. Looks like our OD was possibly smuggling. A Mennonite, smuggling drugs? Uh... You there? Yeah, could you... can you... Could you email me those logs so that I can take a look at them myself? Yeah, you got it. Hey, Jenna. It's bad, right? I mean... Oh, my God. Can you please help me? I... I have this job interview... I mean, I think it's a job interview. I'm pretty sure it is. It's at... It's at Bill Boone Motors. Really? Your dad's not a fan of Bill's, right? They've always kind of had their problems. I'll tell Thomas about it if the time comes. I haven't even gotten the job yet. What would you do, sell cars? I think so. Either that, or I could, you know, refill the coffee and snack machines. At least I have experience doing that. Could you hand me that shirt? Hey, what happened... What happened to your hand? Oh, uh, I-I burned myself. It was stupid. I wasn't thinking. Are you okay? You want me to put some aloe on that? No, it's fine. I could really use your help. I can't wear any of this stuff if I want to have a shot at getting this job. Would you... would you go shopping with me? We'd get out of the house for a while. No, thanks. I'm not feeling great. It won't take long, I promise. I would ask Henry, but black hoodies and sarcasm were never my thing, even in the '90s. Wait, so Henry Coles was with you? Yeah. We were, uh... You know. But yeah, after that, I don't know. I guess I don't really remember much. At least you remember the good shit. So you don't... You don't remember getting hit? Yeah, I get, like, flashes here and there. Doctor says short-term memory loss is normal, but, uh... But it can come back. There's, like, like, triggers or whatever. Man, that's so messed up. Yeah, so, uh, Lincoln fucked up the girls' bathroom, huh? - Yeah. - What's up with that, dude? - Worst prank ever. - Yeah, tell me about it. Yeah, man, we're gonna hit 'em back, though. We got something good planned, too. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. I mean, it's no Lindsay Morgan, but... Oh, shit, I forgot about that. How long you'd have to date her? Three months before I got her to send nudes. Right? That's not really a prank. Bro, what are you talking about? Her brother was Lincoln's fucking team captain. He lost his mind when I sent him those pics. Dude couldn't shoot for shit. We crushed them. It was still kind of fucked-up. Yo, dude, are you okay? Yeah, um, yeah, it's just hot. I'm just a little hot. - Everything okay? - Uh-oh. Yeah, it's just a little warm in here. I'll check the thermostat. But you've got to get ready for PT and I still need those blood samples for Dr. Halpert, so I gotta kick you boys out. Still got 20 minutes, though. You can come back tomorrow. Catch you later, man. - Yeah, later man. - Yeah, later, bro. See you, bro. Yo, feel better soon. Thanks. I started sweating. Don't worry. We'll figure out what's wrong. Yeah, I'm gonna take a look at your legs. All right. Okay. You had an accident. It happens while your body's still adjusting. Make sure you stick to your bowel program. Okay? Let's get you cleaned up. Hello? Jenna? Mom? It's just us. What are you doing? We're inside. Ready. Okay. Remember, the first thing you should do is call me. I'll map your location and find a way to get to you. What's that? My allowance, in case something happens or you need a way to get back. There's $283 there. This is a bad idea. Nope, this is preparation. Smoking marijuana is a bad idea. Here, this will record your heart rate and blood pressure so we have a better sense of what happens right before. Also, you should... You should keep your jacket on, just in case. And here's some sunscreen and an energy bar. You got a parachute and scuba gear, too? No, I don't have those. Now lie down. You're not going to leave me, are you? I have nowhere else to go. My sister uses this when she travels, if you want to borrow it. You can't keep it, though. You... you have to give it back. ♪ Throw me a bone ♪ ♪ The night it trickles ♪ ♪ Like the sleeping sand ♪ ♪ And the road's in my hands ♪ ♪ This old heel gets stuck in every drain ♪ ♪ Tell me why you came ♪ ♪ 'Cause I don't know why ♪ Oh. Wow. Wow. Oh, shit. What happened? Where did you go? It was the same place as last time. I'm pretty sure it was a storage closet. I don't know, though. There was a picture of a... Of a little girl. Another teleporter? I don't know. I don't think so. If your body's taking you to the same place, there's got to be a reason. Maybe there are others like you there. You have to go back. Fuck that. There was somebody on the other side of that door, and I'm pretty sure that they had a gun, so no. Makes sense. Facilities that house people with heightened abilities tend to have high security. It's not a fucking magic science lab, Townes. Well, you don't know that. What if that little girl in the picture needs your help? She could be in trouble. Jesus Christ. - Hey! - Stop it. You can't keep - trying to escape this. - Townes, it's just... You're a superhero. This is your duty. For the last motherfucking time, Townes, I'm not a fucking superhero, okay? - But you are... - Shut the fuck up! Just shut up! Do you think this is fun? You weren't in the car! You weren't there when he... What car? You just... You're... You're not... Ugh, you're not my sidekick. We're not even friends. We barely know each other, and by the way, this isn't a game to me. This is my life. This is real for me. Do you understand that? Yeah. Yes. Townes... Okay, I just... - Townes... - Yes. Okay, Townes, just... Townes, please wait for a second. Just... Fuck. Would you buy a car from me? A mid-range sedan, maybe. Mid-range? How about this extended-cab, fully-loaded semitruck? Do you even know what that means? No, not at all. Of course not. Is it too booby? It's perfectly booby. I just want Henry to be proud of me. Does that sound silly? I know it does, but... Sometimes I think she's, you know, ashamed of... anyway, um, this is going to be good. Just get it so we can go. Honey, are you okay? I'm fine. You're not fine. What's wrong? No, really, I'm fine. I just don't want to be here. I want to go home. Okay, I'll go get my things. I... It really does look nice. I'd buy, like, a really expensive car from you. Come here. Why didn't you go to school today? This was the day that my mom was diagnosed. She... she pulled me out of school and told me it was family fun day. We went ice skating, and we went... We went to the movies and played Parcheesi and ordered pizza. And then after dinner, she told us she was sick. Early-onset Alzheimer's. She didn't want us to worry. She said she wanted to have one perfect day before she forgot. Why isn't your dad with you today? Sometimes I think he doesn't want to talk about her. He talks about her all the time. Talks about the two of you, his mad scientists. Talks about how you used to spend hours in the kitchen, baking, mixing ingredients and coming up with secret recipes. That's why I fell in love with him. Just the way he talked about the two of you. He said you used to make something called a cocoa... Cocoa-doodle surprise. Cocoa-doodle surprise. That's what I tried to make today. What is a cocoa-doodle surprise? It's snickerdoodles with chocolate chips. That's it. I thought I invented it. Then my mom... She didn't want me to know it was from a recipe, so she suggested the name. She sounds like an amazing woman. She was. Eddie, I can't believe you drink this shit. What do you drink? Chilean reds, mostly. So, what are you gonna do when you get out of here? I don't know. Go back to work. You think Bill's gonna hire you back? Even after what you did to Clay? I didn't... Look, I don't know what he's gonna do, but Bill is an understanding guy. What about Jeremiah Miller? Is he as understanding? I don't know who that is. From the Miller farm. Doesn't Boone Motors do a lot of business with him? No. Yeah. I mean, we buy used cars from there, but I'm just the driver. I gotta go. Wait. Thanks for the company, Eddie. Somebody grab him! Okay. Oh, my God, these nails. - No, no. - Is that okay? It'll be okay. Just hide them. They're fine. You're just nervous. Did you guys, like, go shopping or something? Jenna helped me out. Okay. Oh, I gotta run. Wish me luck. - Good luck. - Okay. I don't even know what you're doing, so... I have a job interview, but I don't want to jinx it, so I'll talk to you about it when I get home. I love you. Bye. You shouldn't do that. What? Push your mom away. She's... She's trying to help. So you spent a few hours trying on clothes with my mom and now you think you know my whole fucking life. All I'm saying is, she's here. Don't you have some more cookies to burn? You know, you're not the only one who has shit to deal with. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you unable to sleep because you're teleporting to a scary-ass place at night? No, but at least I give a shit about what's happening to you. You don't even ask me. And today's the day my m... I just... I've been having a hard day, too. And you should tell Cleo what's going on with you, because she's here and you don't have to go through this alone, and that's something. That's a lot. You don't give your mom enough credit. Hey, guys. I'm Clay Boone. After my accident, I... I'm not doing this. Clay, the video is the most important part. Once people see you, they'll donate more. We don't need the money. Everybody needs the money, Clay. Hospitals are, like, insanely expensive. People want to help. Can you come here for a sec? Hey. I miss you. Clay... Everybody's gone. Evening meds aren't for another few hours. It's just you and me. We have some time. Come on, for old times' sake. I'm going crazy in here. I don't think so. Why are you even here? The Kickstarter, Clay. Right. So you can pat yourself on the back, then. Did something real nice for the cripple. Must feel good about yourself. Are you kidding me? You cheated on me, Clay, so no, I'm not feeling really good about myself right now, but I'm here because I'm still your friend. Your friendship isn't what I want. You're an asshole. You know that? Well, you're a fucking lousy lay. At least I can still get laid. Good luck with that. Hey. Someone's been experimenting. I burned them all. What were you trying to make? Cocoa-doodle surprise. For Mom. I thought you'd remember the date. January seventh. That's... That's when Mom told me. I, uh... I just have a different day. And we didn't tell you for a while because... You got any more cookie dough? I used it all, but it's an easy recipe. Time to get to work, kid. So it's a little long. I'm sorry. You know what? I don't need this. Oh, I... I thought this was a job interview. I'm... I'm sorry. I must have misunderstood. No, I don't need a piece of paper to tell me about someone, or four. I want someone I can trust, and what I saw today at the diner was a testament to your character. That's why I want you on my sales team. Are you offering me a job? Now, you don't have to make a decision now. Take as much... Oh, no, no, no, I want it. I mean, I would... I would love to work here. Great. We'll get you set up first thing in the morning, so you can hit the road running, but in the meantime, - try to get the basics. - Oh, my gosh. - Okay? You'll do great. - Okay. Ooh. New suit? Oh, my God. I'm... I figured I could take it back if I didn't get the job. I'm s... so embarrassed. You know what? Hold on. No need to be embarrassed. - Oh, no, no, no, I... - Mm-hmm. I... I told you, I don't do charity. This isn't charity. It's an investment. - That's... - Okay? You're gonna need more than one suit. That's a lot of money. We're going to be working together a long time. A few hundred dollars is nothing compared to what you're gonna bring in. Well, I'll pay you back. You don't have to. Okay, you can pay me back. I know you're good for it. - Okay. - Yeah. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Bright and early. Yeah. Easy, now. I don't want any trouble. Why don't we go for a drive? Okay. SPL-70 U joints. 35 zipline axle shafts. Hey, Mom? Oh, hey, honey. Do you have a second? There's just something that I, um... I wanted to talk to you about. Oh, sure. I could use a break. Is everything okay? Yeah, um, I... There's just this thing that I haven't, um... What thing? Whatever it is, you can tell me. What is that? Why do you... why do you have that? I got a new job. You are looking at the newest saleswoman at Bill Boone Motors. - What? I know, isn't it great? Eh, of course, I have to learn 152 pages of this by tomorrow. I'm sorry, you're going to work for Bill Boone? No, I'm just... I mean, do you think that that's, like, a good idea? Well, I mean, I know, I know what people say about him, but he's really not that bad, and you know, he could use the extra help right now, especially... He's got a lot on his plate with Clay. Right. Honey, I am doing this for you. We're not gonna have to worry about medical bills or missing appointments. You need me. We need each other, and I know I haven't been there, not nearly enough, and now, I mean, you can tell... Tell people that your mom's a saleswoman and not a waitress. Mom, I've never... I've never cared about that. Well, sure, no, I... Me either. I just... Hey, I'm... I'm really proud of you. Yeah? Yeah. That's great. Don't tell Thomas just... Just yet. Okay. Hey, I'm sorry. What is it you wanted to talk to me about? Oh, it's nothing. We agreed, no secrets. I know. I'm just, um... I'm very tired. I didn't actually sleep at all last night while I was up late, studying, so... You sure? Yeah. Okay, well, I'm here if you need me. - Okay. - Get some rest, sweetheart. ♪ She's just dying to please you ♪ ♪ She's just dying to please you ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ She's just dying to please you ♪ Man. What's up? Pop wanted to make sure you got some real food in you. Thanks. Here. What are you doing? It's ketchup. Yeah, I know what it is. I don't need you to do that for me. My hands still fucking work. - Yeah, I know that. I'm all-state. I have three district titles. I don't need your fucking help. I want to go home. Yeah, Clay, you will. A'ight, just a few more weeks and then... No, tomorrow. Man, I really don't think that's a good idea. You just started your rehab. Fucking call Dad and just tell him to get me the hell out of here. Bill. We need to talk. Fuck me. Aah! Aah! You. You killed my wife. Let us go. Ah, I can't do that. Not up to me. Take me. Just let my son go, please. Let's start with you putting the gun down. Do you know what they'll do to him? I understand you're upset. He won't survive. He might not have the gene. Even if he does, it'll be years before his abilities develop. I'm offering you a future. You turn yourself in, you can help raise your son. You can still be a father. You'll have a long time together. He's just a boy. And we'll take care of him. Along with you. All you've got to do is come with us. Don't fight this, trust me. Just let us go. That's not how this ends. You know that. Put the gun down and come with me. No, wait!
