 I'm really contemplating telling Elaine about Jeremy. Oh, my God, not this again, dude. We have a no-alcohol office policy. - He should respect that. - Yeah, yeah, I know, but you found a bottle of wine under his desk at a Christmas party. Okay, I just think in our line of work, it's pretty inappropriate. Mm-hmm. Okay, so, let's say HR receives an anonymous tip

 about some vodka in Jeremy's top drawer. Go on. Then, hypothetically, they'd do a routine search of his desk and find a stash. A stash that you planted. Yeah, or he could be holding. I mean, you don't truly know anybody that you work with. I mean, look at you. I know those aren't prescription lenses. Okay, well, I know what this is actually about. You just want a sweet corner office. Okay, his office is just so much closer to the bathroom.

 - There it is. - Yeah, and it would make field work a lot easier if I didn't have to go back to that fucking cubicle. Since when did you not like being in the field? I thought you liked traveling with me. - Oh, God. - He's weak. Shit, I thought he wasn't supposed to teleport. He's not. Bet he needs more Factor. Do we have enough? Yeah, back in the van. - Okay. - All right. One, two, three, fold out. Okay. All right, all right. Okay. Yep. All right. Let's go. Are you okay? Jenna! I think so. You? Yeah. He... he just... Yeah. He was in your room, Henry, when I came home. I saw him, too. Where? At... at the hospital? No. When I was a kid. It was at Dippy's house, but, like, before it was Dippy's house, when it was my house, and my dad was there. W-When you were a kid? I don't... I don't understand. They were fighting, and my dad was trying to protect me, and he didn't leave. He didn't leave me. He didn't leave my mom. That guy took him. He was the one who took him. And now he's after you. Yeah. Hey, it's... it's my dad. He's at the hospital. What do I do? What if they saw you disappear? Jenna, I don't know. Don't answer. No, I really think... - Jenna... I really think that I should answer it. Ow! Jenna, look at this shit. How are we supposed to explain this? We just... We're gonna... We will figure it out, okay? We're gonna start cleaning, and we'll figure it out. Okay? Okay. Cleo, you shouldn't go in there. - Get away from me. - Listen, you cannot be here. I'm serious right now. - The hell I can't. - Listen to... - Hey. - Cleo. Cleo! - I tried to stop her. - Did you know? Did you know what your son did to my daughter? Look, this isn't... Let's discuss this later. Jesus, Bill. No, not about that! Look... Not until last night, but I spoke with Clay, and I think there's been a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding? Your son assaulted my daughter. Now, we don't know anything to be sure. Excuse me? What did you say to her? Why is she scared of you? Scared of me? What's... Honestly, I have no idea. I have done everything in my power to protect her. I would never hurt her. Protect her from what? Look, Cleo, Henrietta... It's Henry, not Henrietta. I'm sure that... That helps you think of her as some delicate little girl, but it is Henry, okay? Okay. All right, fine. Henry. But look, I'm the one who's trying to make this right, even now. Tell me you didn't hire me to shut her up. To keep your kid out of jail. No, of course not. I told you... You think because you've got money and police friends, you can buy your way out of hurting my daughter? No way. No fucking way. I'm not scared of you and your stupid auto center, folksy businessman of America bullshit. All right, Mrs. Coles, it's time for you to leave. Get your hands off me! This isn't your problem, Dale. We both know that's not true. Don't make this worse. What are you even doing here? What's going on? Listen, Cleo, I'll come by the house later and explain everything. Lucas, escort Cleo out of the building. Come on, just... Cleo, come on, come on. What is going on? Bill! You look good, Lucas. Glad to see it. I don't believe we've had the pleasure, ma'am. She's a new employee at the auto center. Don't worry. You can trust her. I think it's time for me to go. I don't think that's wise just now. Don't you agree, Bill? You're gonna have to stay with us for a while now. All right, come on. Just get back here. Let's get down to business, shall we? Deputy Hulce. Aren't you a little close? Hiding in plain sight. Get in. As a reminder, you're here as a friend of the DEA and not in any official capacity an officer of the law. Understood. Your sidearm. You're kidding. DEA protocol. There's a headset for you. Coffee's a little cold, but it still works. I'm good. Get comfortable. There's always a fair amount of dick-measuring before these assholes get down to it. Maybe you could help us with an ID. Tall blonde in the back? She's not in our files. Just started seeing her around Boone Motors recently. That's Cleo Coles. She's a sales rep at the dealership. Total bystander. So she works with Bill? On the dealership side. She's not part of the drug business. Got a positive ID on Barbie. New employee. All teams stand by. Can we get her out of there? Jeremiah Miller just arrived. We're not doing anything until we see cash and drugs. Hi, sweetheart. It's me. Um, I'm sitting with you now at the hospital and... I don't know, I just... I wanted to hear your voice. That's all. I'm gonna keep calling you. Hi, sweetheart. It's me. Um, I'm sitting with you now at the hospital and... I don't know., I just... I wanted to hear your voice. That's all. - All right. - Oof! And here we go. You stitching me up with a machete back there? Almost done, sir. Um, she's not in her sunniest of moods, but she'd like to talk to you. Oh, hey. If there's a free moment, could you mention how well we did intercepting you? We could use the high marks for our promotion, so... Give me the fucking phone. - Yeah? You'd be dead if my team hadn't tracked you down. I'm aware. What the hell happened? I need to know if, uh, any of my previous targets had a daughter named Henrietta Coles. There's no evidence to support hereditary links. Besides, those files are classified. Well, de-fucking-classify them, then. Listen, I get it. You're tired. We'll search the database, if that's what you want, but I need you back in Reston right away. All right. You gonna count it? Money isn't necessary. What are you talking about? These are gifts, free of charge. Is this some kind of a joke? It may come as a surprise to you, Bill, but I... I rarely joke. What's going on here? After many fruitful years, we've come to the end of the road. I began this business in service of my community and my family, not at the cost of them. All fields fallow in time. We will no longer need your services. What the hell is going on? This gift is a farewell, and we only want one thing in return. Honesty. I want to admit that you and your boy here killed my son. We need to move now. Luis signaled to wait. We need an exchange, Deputy. Without money changing hands, all we've got are border violations and armed possession. Jeremiah is not here for an exchange. Lucas Boone murdered his son. This is revenge. It's about to turn into a bloodbath. There are innocent lives in there! We move when Luis calls it in. Jenna? I cleaned everything up. But there's a crack in one of the picture frames and the blood's not coming out, but maybe if we just, you know, let it soak for a minute. You know, we could try bleaching it. I mean, it might hurt the rug, but bleach is easier to... It's easier to explain than blood, and... What a... I can do it. Doesn't it hurt? Keeping everything inside? I mean, I'm... I don't know if that means I'm weaker, but I'm not sure if it's strength, what you're doing. What are you talking about? I mean, I d... I just stabbed a guy and spent, like, a half-hour cleaning the blood out of our rug, but you're just washing the dishes, like it's any other day of the week. Jenna, I'm... Aren't you scared? I am. I am really fucking scared, Henry, and you just want to pretend like none of this happened. That's not true... No, like Clay never hurt you, like you didn't just teleport out of a hospital, like there isn't something wrong with you, but there is! There is something really wrong with you. Jesus, Jenna, I know! What do you want me to do? Do you want me to cry? Do you want me to run to my mom? What do you think she's gonna do? Do you think that she's gonna want to just stay here, where all of this shit has happened? She fucking likes it here. I told your mom. About Clay. What? Do you remember what you said to her? Before your seizure? Henry, you... You started to tell her the truth. And she asked me if I knew anything about it, and I... No. That wasn't yours to tell. It's my dad. I can't just keep ignoring him. Just answer it. And say what? I don't know. Tell him that I woke up, I got scared, I came home, and I'm fine now. So lie again for you? You know, you act like you don't have any secrets. What's that supposed to mean? Just do whatever you want. You clearly do anyway. Hi, Dad. Jenna. Listen to me. Henry is missing. You know, maybe she's wandering around the hospital. I-I really don't know. Nobody knows. - Dad, slow down. Maybe she woke up in the room when I wasn't there. I mean, I should have been there, but I wasn't, and I promised Cleo. I promised your mom, and now nobody has any idea where the hell she is. No, Dad, it's okay. She's here. She... what? What? Yeah, she's at the house. Uh, she woke up and got scared and... I don't know. I think somebody may have dropped her off. I don't know, but she's here. She's okay. Okay. And you didn't think to pick up the phone and tell me this? Hell, I've been calling and calling and calling. Yeah, I'm sorry. Do you have any idea how worried everybody is here? I got doctors and nurses. They are scouring this entire hospital. This is insane, and I do not believe you. You, of all people, with everything that happened with your mom, you should know how important it is to call. Y-you're right. Um... I'm really sorry, Dad. And what am I supposed to tell Cleo when she calls now, huh? Isn't she at the hospital with you? No, she left. Said she had something to do for Henry. And I called, like, a dozen times. - Nothing. - What do you... what do you mean? Hi! Excuse me, hi! Yeah? I know where Henry is. And my daughter. Just give me a sec. I gotta go deal with this, and I will talk to you when I get home. Did he say she left? - Why would she leave? - I don't know. He said she needed to do something for me? What does that mean? Jenna, what exactly did you tell her? I-I told you. She was beating herself up for not knowing what was happening to you. She just needed to understand. What? What Clay did to me? Yeah. That, and... Bill. I told her that you were afraid of him. Why? Why? Why would you do that? Because you are! Okay? You won't tell me why, but I... I know that you are. Jenna, I don't... I wouldn't... I wouldn't tell you because you do shit like this, Jenna! Fuck! Shit. Henry. Henry, we thought you were going to die, okay? And your mom... she was... She was asking me questions, and she deserved answers. - What are you doing? - I need your keys. - Why? - Because my mom is off to pick a fight with Bill fucking Boone because of some shit that you said! Okay, well, I'm... I'm coming with you! Well, you got some balls on you, coming in here and making false accusations. They're not false, Bill. We found Amos' Bible in your son's bedroom. You broke into my house? Even you had to admit how strange it is he died here. That demanded inquiry, which paid off. I don't even know what the hell you think this Bible proves. It proves that your son was with Amos before he died. He's probably the last one... Probably the last one who saw him alive. Well, shit, Jeremiah. You've been living on that farm so damn long, I don't think you realize that what you're throwing around here is a hell of a lot of conjecture. - Isn't that right? - Yeah, I didn't do anything. I get it. I get it. I do. You wanted to believe your son was stronger than he was, but please, that doesn't mean that you have to take my boy down with him. I will give you this one chance for atonement. Get down on your knees, confess to murdering my son, and beg for forgiveness. From Amos, from my wife, from God. I'm not doing that. I will do it with you. Beg for my own forgiveness. Dear Lord, we pray for all the hurt all the pain, all the sorrow, that we caused our community and our families. Please, Bill. - Do it with me. Bill! - Stop. Do it! So you do not feel my pain. Get up. You're embarrassing yourself. You don't think I've suffered enough? I've got nothing to atone for. Your son crippled my boy. He put Clay in that fucking chair for the rest of his life! What? Amos? What? Stop. Truly, Bill, my son - would never do such a sur... - Her daughter was there! She saw everything. What? She pointed out Amos to me. She said he was the one who did it. You brought Henry into this? I was protecting our kids. He attacked Clay and Henrietta. I told her I'd protect her, and I meant it! This girl lied to you, Bill. My son would never do such a thing. I swear on my life. What about the shipment my driver lost? It was retribution. You took the money. We didn't even know about that until you offered our money back to us! What have you done? All of this... This is built on delusion. Where is this girl now? I want to speak with her! Pop, I told you she lied to you. - Lucas, stop. - She fucking lied. No. No, this is over. This is over right now. We don't even know if he's telling the truth! Yes, we do! Henry made it up to get you off her ass because... 'cause you scared the shit out of her. And look, Amos didn't... He didn't deserve what happened to him. And he always called you the weak one. - Wait! - Oh, shit! Gun! Shit! Move in! Move in! Deputy, wait! You are clear to breach. Position! I need more ammo! Brendan! Cleo, stay down! Okay. Come on! Go! Are you okay? You're not hurt? Okay. - I'm hit! - What? Follow me and stay close. Oh, shit! Okay, go. Run. Okay. Go! Get down! Get down! Okay, get in. - What is it? - You'll be safe. Just keep your head down. Stop! Drop the bag. Turn around! I... oh, shit! Oof! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Hey, move over! - Oh, my God! Move the fuck over right now! - Move! - Please, no, Lucas! Lucas, don't! - Ah! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. DEA! Drop your weapons! Hands up! Freeze! Let me see your hands! Drop your weapons right now! - You, don't move! - That's it, easy! Hands behind your back! Okay, okay, put your hands down right now! Face on the floor! It's over, Bill. Easy. Get down on your knees! Hey, hey, hey! Don't move! Oh, my God. That's my mom's car. Henry, I think we should stay in the car. Henry! Mom! - Hey, stop, stop. - Mom! Henry? - Where's my mom? - It's fine, it's fine. Listen to me. We were right about Lucas and what he did to Amos Miller. And whatever Bill had you do, we got him. We got Bill Boone. Is my mom here? Can I talk to her? - What? - She's with Lucas. What? What does that mean? He took her. Okay, where? Where did he take her? We're not sure yet. Are you fucking serious? But we have an APB out, and we are going to find her, okay? How? How do you know that? You don't... you don't know that. I don't think Lucas has any intention of hurting your mom. You just told me he killed someone! Fuck... shit. Henry, where are you... Henry! Fuck! It's okay. Let's just... Is here anywhere in particular that you're headed? - I don't know! - I... Okay, how about we... We head back to town? No! Lucas, I need to get back to the hospital. I need to get back to Henry. Yeah, then why did you leave her? What? Why didn't you just stay at the hospital? Why'd you have to come running back in the dealership like that? I was just about to get the fuck out of there, and then you made me go back in, you made it worse. And I told you that, too, but you wouldn't listen to me. Nobody fucking listens to me! He never listened to me, never. If he would've just fucking listened to me, we wouldn't have all this fucking bullshit. Dead people everywhere... Did you see that shit? Like, what the fuck? And yes, I messed up, okay? I did, but how am I supposed to know the real shit when everybody keeps fucking lying to me? Okay. Listen to me, honey. Will you listen to me? What? Listen, we're gonna just... let's turn around, let's go back. We're not going back. What... what's wrong? Are you okay? You were right. I should've told her. I should've fucking told her. She would've never come here. She would've known not to fucking come here! Who? Your mom? I got a kid killed, Jenna. A kid's fucking dead, and it's my fault. And now Lucas Boone just drove off with my mom. I mean, he just fucking took her, and nobody knows where the hell they are, and I don't... I don't know what to do! You... You fucking just tell me what to do? I don't know what to do. I'm gonna call Clay. What? No. It's his brother, and Lucas might've taken your mom there, or maybe Clay knows where he'd take her. Jenna, he's not going to tell you shit. We'll make him. Mr. Boone, I'm Deputy... I know who you are, Deputy Hulce. I guess you would. I told Dale to keep an eye on you. Well, he should've listened. What makes you think he didn't? You, sitting there, handcuffed. Mm? You got a smirk on your face. Well, that's a perk I rarely get to enjoy. Excuse us, Deputy. Okay, Mr. Boone, we're gonna need to get that wire back from you. Never should've gotten that messy. Well, as long as you get my boy Lucas back, it'll all be worth it. Right. Come on, gotta get you processed and released. What is this? You're not letting him go. What the fuck, Luis? The Millers were always our primary target. - But... - Look. Look, you're not the only person that told us about this meet. Bill set it up. The whole case against Jeremiah. Even handed us a bunch of dirty cops. Hell, you'll probably get a promotion. So he walks? Full immunity? Probation, time served. But what about Lucas Boone? He's got an innocent woman with him. You know we have an APB out. We'll find them. Take today as a win. Trust me. Devil always catches up, huh? What does that mean? Well, my stepdad is a pastor. Pretty big one, too. Like, he's got a microphone and shit, and he's always saying stuff like "Strong men have to take care of the weak, because..." I don't know. Because some... Look, I... I tried to be strong. I really, really tried. I tried to take care of my brother and my dad, but it all got so messed up! You don't always have to be the strong man, Lucas. You know, when I came home that night, I told him what I did. I mean, he asked me to do it, but the look on his face was like... It's like I wasn't even me he was looking at. Like I was my brother, you know, like I was Clay. He was... He was so proud of me. Isn't that fucked up? Yeah. That man at the dealership with the hat... I killed his son. God, I thought I was doing something right, something justified. - Henry didn't know. - Henry? Yeah, it's not her fault. You don't know my dad. I mean, not really. He... He makes people do things that they don't want to do, and he has had it out for Jeremiah for years. I knew that. I mean, shit, he probably drove her up their farm with Amos in mind, just to get under Jeremiah's skin. Hey, truth is, I... I am no good. I wish I were, but I don't even think I ever had a chance. My brother and... my dad... We're not good men. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. Wait, what are we doing? Lucas, Lucas, what are you doing? Lucas, I need to get back to my daughter. Please get out of the car. Lucas... Get out. What's he smiling about? All have strayed and come short of God's glory. There is none righteous, not one. When I dragged him off the road... Amos... Every step I took, he just got heavier and heavier, and he wasn't that big of a dude, so I just kept telling myself, "Just a little bit further, man. "Just a little bit further, "and then this shit will finally be over, "and you don't have to think about it anymore and it's all just gonna go away." And then, I got back to the car. I found this on the floor. I mean, I should've brought it back and I should've left it with Amos, or just ditched it, but I couldn't. I think it's from his mom, and... He... I read his notes in the corners, and... things he had underlined, and his questions. Like, there's nothing really special here, but I just go over it again and again, and it's like, you know, at least I know what he was thinking, you know? You can't... forgive me, can you? For what I did? Ah, you're right. You shouldn't. I know Henry needs you. I... What about you? What about me? At least let me take the bullets from that gun. Please. You're a good mom, you know that? My mom, she tries, but just... - Doesn't. - Lucas... Tell Henry I'm sorry, okay? Holy shit. Oh, my God. No, Henry... Henry, no! - Mom... - Would Lucas? I don't know. No, Henry! You don't even know if she's in there! Henry! Mom? Mom? Mom? Is my mom here? Henry... Clay, is my mom here? Is she here? No. No... Please help me. Henry... Fuck. Here. Ah! Townes? Henry. Henry. Henry. What are you doing? What are you doing? Come on.
