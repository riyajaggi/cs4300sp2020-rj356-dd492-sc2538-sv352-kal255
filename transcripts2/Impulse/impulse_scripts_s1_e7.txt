 I told you to stop it and you didn't stop. Henry, you kissed me! Do you not remember that? You forced... your fingers... inside me and I told you no. Fuck. What happened? I don't know, man. Did Henry Coles do this? I'm sorry, but I was in the next room. I heard what she was saying to you...

 I don't know what she was talking about. All right, Lucas? I didn't do anything to her. It was not like that. Hey, hey, hey. You hear me? Right? It wasn't like that. I'm not like that. No, I know, I know, I know. It's cool. All right, we better clean this shit up. Clay Boone? I'm Deputy Hulce. We haven't officially met. I'm responding to a disturbance call from one of your neighbors.

 They said somebody threw a rock through your window. I assume you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I do. Well, did you see who did it? No, no, uh... I was in my room. I was doing some PT. You know, some exercises. You know, I was the first responder right after your accident. How you been holding up? Still sitting. So... - Your father home? - No, he's at work. Would you mind if I take a look around and make sure there's no other signs of forced entry? Actually... actually, uh, I think we're good here. All right. Okay. Well... if you see any... thing suspicious, or any other... We'll give you a call. Okay. Hey, what's up? ♪ I can be your lifesaver ♪ ♪ Treat me like a jawbreaker ♪ Sweet playlist, man. It's not a playlist. What? It's not a playlist. It's a mood. Oh, okay. Cool. Hey, man, grab me a shot. Let's do shots. Oh, yeah! You want next game? Uh, no, no, I'm good, man. All right. ♪ If you don't come back I think I'ma lose it ♪ Yo, Daron, what's up! ♪ If I ever had your number ♪ Yo, Clay, I thought you said only a few friends were coming over. I mean, they might've invited some friends as well, but, uh... - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. Should you be mixing that with your meds? Absolutely. Come on, you got to give us something. Look at his face. That... that is the face of a man who has had some pussy on his face. Out of here. I know. I know you... You're an idiot. Hey, babe, you want to get me another beer? No. Serves you right. Oh, yeah! - Boop! - Ow. Oh, I'm sorry, miss. Is this a pedestrian walkway? Seriously? Look, uh, thanks for being cool with me bringing Damian. Yeah. Yeah, he's, uh... one of a kind. Yep. Um, listen. Can I ask you something? And I want you to be, like, totally honest with me. Okay. I mean, it's not bad or anything. I just... Was I good to you? Like, as a boyfriend? Like, did you buy me enough candles before you decided to screw around? No, no. I mean, did you ever... Did you ever feel like like I put pressure on you? To... Pressure to do what? Sleep with you? I guess. I mean... Were there times when maybe it felt like I was more in the mood than you were? Well, you're a guy, so obviously, sometimes, yeah. But I never did anything I didn't want to do with you. That's not who I am. Okay. Where is this coming from? No, I just... I've had a lot of time to think, you know? - Okay. - So, yeah. Chug! Chug! Chug! Hey, Clay, dude... Wake up. Hey. What happened? Man, I told you to be careful mixing. Where'd everyone go? Hey, Lucas. What's up? I can't... I can't believe this is me. You know? This is my life. Just yell if you think you're gonna be sick. All right? What the fuck? Shit! Help! Help, Lucas! Lucas! Breakfast? Yeah. What the hell went on in here? Threw a party last night for the team. After the loss to Lincoln, you know, everyone kind of wanted to blow off some steam. And, uh, it kind of got out of hand. You hung over? A little, yeah. Good. May the punishment fit the crime. Better get busy cleaning. Uh, hey, Dad. Uh... Where'd you go? Had to take care of some stuff. Listen, I'm gonna call the Millers and set up a meet. This thing'll be over soon. Right. Yo, what was that about? Listen, there's something I want to show you. Just... go get dressed, will you? I'll finish up here. So what, you and Dad put together another old roadster or something? - What the hell is this? - Hold on, just let me explain. Are you fucking kidding me, man? I don't want to see this shit. I wouldn't've brought you here if it wasn't important. Oh, what, 'cause you want me to face my fears or some shit, man? - Fuck you! - Clay, just... just fucking listen to me, okay? Just listen. Henry was with you when this shit happened to your car. Right? - Right? - Yeah. Okay. She was in my trunk just before this happened. Wait, what? Why was she in your trunk? Okay, it d... it doesn't matter. Honestly, I-I know that sounds nuts, but look, my trunk and your car... it's like the same shit happened to both of them, like the same kind of fucking suck bomb or some shit went off inside them. Oh, right, okay, so Henry put, uh... She planted bombs in the both of our cars? - Is that what you're saying? - No, I'm just saying, she said she did this to you. Why would she say that if she didn't mean it? Because she's fucking crazy. - No, man. - Because she's a liar. You and I both know Dad's partners did this. Yeah, we only know any of that shit because she said so. And it makes actual fucking sense, unlike whatever Benghazi shit you got whirling around in your head. Dude I don't know. I just have this feeling and I don't know how else to describe it. Well, your feeling's wrong. Henry was confused, okay? And people who are confused... They talk shit. And now she's got us both freaking out because you can't mind your own goddamn business. Everything she was saying last night was insane. Don't let her fuck with your head too. I think she was telling the truth. You do? About everything? - Clay, man... - Wow. All right, you know what, man? I'm done with this bullshit. Clay, man, I'm sorry. - Oh, hey, boys. Hey, Gale, can you grab my paycheck? Sure thing, honey. You just missed Henrietta. What? She told me what happened. Dad, I didn't do anything. She didn't blame you. She said she threw the rock. - What? - I don't know what's going on between you two, but you better kiss and make up tonight, okay? 'Cause we need her on our side. You understand that? Tonight? What are you talking about? Cleo invited us over to her house tonight for dinner. Why? - Fuck that. Watch your language. No, I'm not going to that. The hell you're not. - I'm not going, Dad. - Excuse me. Bill? Bill Boone? What? Ken Davidson, Lanwood Insurance. - You're the adjuster? That's right. - We spoke on the phone. Yeah. I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but I've read just about every magazine you have to offer, and I'd love to steal a few minutes of your time about the accident involving your son, Clay Boone. - Well, uh, actually, I got a couple things I have to handle, uh, but this is my son, Clay. He can answer some of your questions, help you get started. How about that? I've, uh, seen pictures of your truck. Pretty nasty-looking accident. Can you tell me what you remember? Not much. I was in my truck, I guess, and then... I woke up in a hospital. Immediately? Um... I don't know. It feel like, one moment, you're in your truck, the next, the hospital? Kind of. Have you ever lost time before this incident? What? Any history of seizures? It's for the claim. No. Was anyone with you or nearby at the time of the accident? Listen, man, I just told you everything I remember. We good here? Uh, I didn't mean to upset you. I'm... I'm just trying to make sure I have all the facts. Look, I'm the victim here, okay? I'm the one who's fucking paralyzed. So I don't need you asking all these questions. - I don't need to relive this shit. - Look, I didn't mean to... - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Okay, whatever, man. - Just get the fuck out of here. - Hey, hey, Clay! Stop. - I didn't do anything wrong, Dad. - Stop, stop! Look, Mr. Davidson, my son's been through a lot. Why don't you give me a call on Monday and you and I can discuss anything else you need, all right? Of course. Thank you for your time. I'll get it! Henry, you kissed me! Do you not remember that? Fuck. Of course I remember. Okay, all right. So you remember kissing me... Not now. I kissed you, but that doesn't mean that I wanted it. You hurt me! Stop! Don't move! Fuck. I thought that was you. Are you okay? Fine. Just cold. Well, I'll give you a ride. No, you really don't have to do that. Get in. Where are you coming from? Nowhere. Just taking a walk. In this weather? I guess there are worse ideas. I hadn't been out to the Boones' place before. It's nice. See, a neighbor saw a young blond woman, about 5'5", vandalize their window. I'm 5'6", so... I thought you and the Boones were close. We're not. Well, maybe I misunderstood. I... I figured as much because you were in Clay's car just before his accident. But maybe that was the wrong place... Are you gonna take me home, or arrest me? Are those my two options? You remind me of this kid that I used to know. He has his guard up too. Sometimes that takes more energy than it's worth. Look, I'm trying to say that you can talk to me. Hey, hey, wait! That's not... Oh, God. Um... Henry? Oh, fuck. Um... Hey. Fuck. Hey, are you okay? No, please! Please don't touch me. Here. I think I should just... I need to get out of the car for a minute. Yeah, yeah, get some air. You all right? Yeah, sorry. I have seizures and the medication helps. Okay. Henry, did you recognize that man in that photo? No. No, I didn't know him. But maybe you've seen him? Around with Bill? I c-can't... - I can't say. - Okay, you... you can't why? Why? Did Bill tell you not to say anything? No. No, it's not that. It's just that my mom works for Bill, so I don't think I can really be talking about him like this. I can keep your mom safe. No, you can't. You can't. If you know about Bill, then why don't you just do something? You're a cop. You can... You can arrest him or something. It's not that simple. I need evidence to hold him. I don't feel good. Can you please take me home? Okay. But just... wait, wait, wait. Just wait. If you ever wanna talk, don't call the station. Call me directly. Okay. I won't tell Cleo about the rock incident. Okay? We can keep that between us. Thanks for the ride. What is going on? Why is Anna Hulce dropping you off? I threw a rock through Bill Boone's window. What? - My God... - Mom, listen... - Oh, Henry... - I'm really sorry. Clay and I got into a fight about the accident because I left him there and he was really, really angry and I just freaked out. I didn't know what to do. That is my boss' house. Do you understand that? Do you understand the position that you just put me in? Do you ever use your head, Henry? Do you ever think about anyone but yourself? - Mom, I know, I wasn't thinking. - I could lose my job over this. It happened really fast and I will apologize - to Mr. Boone. - I just got this job! Do you know how important it is? - I will apologize. What? I want to apologize to Mr. Boone in person, so that he knows that it was my fault. Yeah, okay, well, I think... Yeah, I-I... I think that's a good start. But it doesn't make up for what you did. You know, I have to come up with some kind of punishment for you. Okay. That's fine. Yeah. I should go to bed. Yeah, go to your room and stay there, and don't... Don't come back down for the rest of the night. I'm really sorry, Mom. Thank you. Um, you busy? Um, kind of, yeah. Are you okay? You sound weird. Yeah, Jenna. I'm just tired. How'd it go with Josh? It's fine. Listen, I think I'm gonna crash... I had sex tonight. In my room. With Zach. It was... my first time. Do you want to talk about it? Maybe, yeah. Okay. So how did it go? It was good. Um... You know, actually, actually, it was... it was all right. I don't know. I felt... sort of out-of-body. Was Zach okay to you? Yeah. He was sweet, but maybe just not the right person. I don't know. I feel like there's something wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with you. Look, you're either into it or you're not. There are no rules. But I like rules. I know you do. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I will be. Morning. Want some eggs? No, it's too much protein. So... Do you remember when you told me to stay away from Bill Boone? Yeah. But then my mom took a job with him, and you didn't do anything. Well, there's no convincing your mom once she's made up her mind. You know that. Right, but you said he was dangerous. - So is he? Is he dangerous, or... - Well... Henry, you know that I would never let your mom work for the guy if I thought that he was, you know, actually gonna hurt someone. It's not that. How can I say this? Um... After Elizabeth got sick, medical bills started piling up. Bill Boone swoops in behind our back, pays them off. Said he was doing us a favor. Yeah, but he's gonna hold that debt over my head until the day I die. And he'll say he's a friend, but it comes at a price. Henry, grab your coat. Uh, why? I thought a lot about what happened last night, and I want to be there when you apologize to Bill. Don't you think that I should do this on my own, Mom? I just... I really don't wanna, like, involve you, or... Henry, stop. We're going. I'm gonna be late. - Come on. - Mom. Hi, Bill. Uh, if you have a moment, my daughter would like to have a word with you. Sure. Hi, Henrietta. Mom, um, I can handle this if you wanna get to work. Henry, we talked about this. Yeah, I know. I just would really like to do this on my own, so can you please... You can go on, Cleo. Uh, you know, Tim is out today, actually, so you're needed on the floor. Okay. Come find me when you're done. Hey. Everything okay? Just here to apologize in person about last night. Do you mean the party? Please. Look, this may sound unconventional, but, you know, I'm glad he had people over. Poor kid's been down so much lately, you know? No, I'm talking about the broken window. I threw the rock. Clay and I got into a fight... Clay failed to mention that, but listen, I, of all people, know how tempers can flare when alcohol is involved. Look at you standing there. You look terrified. Have a seat. Come on. You've been through a lot, Henrietta, and I appreciate you coming here today. More proof of what a good girl you are. You know, I read in the paper that a young Mennonite OD'd. And I recognized him. It's a real shame about the drug epidemic in this town, don't you think? Yeah. I just really care about Clay. Like, a lot, and, I mean, you know that. So when I saw what happened to him I felt... Relieved. Well, it's interesting that you would say that. But again, I do think it's a shame what drugs can do to a person. I wouldn't ask that on anyone, especially one of my boys. Just thought that maybe you had... Shoot. Sorry, I gotta cut this short. I got another meeting. What? Okay, that's fine. Henrietta. There's no use in picking at an old scab. Just takes longer to heal. You understand, hmm? When I said I'd protect you, I meant it. Bill, I'm sorry about all of this. Please. Don't even mention it. You've got a good kid here. - Everyone has a bad day. - Thank you. Can you have a seat? I just want to ask Bill a quick question. Hello. My name is Ken Davidson. I have an appointment with Mr. Boone about a claim. Okay, you can go ahead and take a seat, and I'll let you know when Bill's ready to see you. Thank you. Excuse me. Could you pass me one of those magazines? All I got here is "Good Housekeeping." Yeah. Henry. Thank you. Okay, so, I just invited Bill and the boys over for dinner tonight. Why? Well, it feels like the right thing to do, considering how nice Bill has been about all of this. I don't think that Bill and Thomas even get along. Are you sure that that's a good idea? I don't think that that's a good idea. I get that it might be awkward for you after your fight with Clay, but I think you two can sit through one dinner together. So, do you want me to give you a ride home? - I could take my break early. - No, I can walk. Just takes longer to heal. You understand? When I said I'd protect you, I meant it. You shouldn't've done that. It's dangerous. What if Bill had caught you recording him? You heard him. He likes me. He thinks that we're, like, allies or something, which means that I have access. That's gotta be good, right? I need you to tell me everything you know about Amos Miller. I c... I c... That is the only way I can help. Bill thinks that Amos is the one who put Clay in the hospital. Do you think Amos... I mean, I know that you said he overdosed, but do you think that... I don't know anything for sure. Have you seen a small Bible with Amos' name on the front? Uh, either at Bill's house or the dealership? No. But the Boones are coming to my house for dinner tonight. Henry left him there, Thomas, and then she... Look, it's just a dinner, okay? You don't owe Bill a thing. They're not coming over. - Jenna... - No, let me make up an excuse. We could... I don't know. I'll say that I'm sick. Please don't. It's fine. How is it fine? One night's not gonna kill me. Uh, it might. That family is made up entirely of people capable of murder. I can handle it. Who cares if you can handle it? You shouldn't have to. It's like you're trying to punish yourself or something. Maybe I am. Well, that's fucked-up. Yeah, sure is. What the hell, Henry? You're... practically a misogynist against yourself now. ♪ I feel you in my bones ♪ ♪ Do you think of me ♪ I'll get it. ♪ All of the dust and dirt in the ground ♪ ♪ At some point was somebody who thought ♪ ♪ They felt you in their bones ♪ ♪ They thought that they were in love ♪ ♪ Thought that they were in love ♪ Hi. Hi. Won't you come in? ♪ Do you feel electric ♪ ♪ In your hands and legs ♪ ♪ I sense the gravity shifting ♪ You didn't have to bring anything, Bill. Please, it's the least I could do. We don't get a lot of home cooking at the Boone house. I bought that bottle some years ago, when I was in Italy. I was letting it age, but then I got sober, and so I'm just glad it could go to a good home. I would kill to go to Italy. Ever since I saw that movie, "Under the Tuscan Sun." Oh. Has anyone seen that? Yeah, I have. It's pretty good. Isn't it gorgeous? Italy would suit you. Ah, well, someday maybe. Everyone dig in. Don't let it get cold. Bill? You praying, Lucas? Uh, yeah, yeah. Um... Sorry, sorry. It's just something that I started doing recently. It's, uh... No, would you... Please, don't apologize. We should all do it. Would you mind leading us? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Thank you, Lord, for this food we are about to receive. In Jesus' name, amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Clay, when are you going back to school? Um... Next week. Bet you're anxious to get back at it, huh? Hang out with your pals and all that stuff. Yes, sir, yeah. I've been going a little stir-crazy at home. Jenna, would you mind passing me the rolls, please? All right, just... Thanks. Anytime. That's quite a scar there on your arm, Clay. Oh, yeah. Broke my arm when I was a kid. He fell out of a tree. How do you know that? I told her. Henrietta stopped by the office today to apologize for the rock, and, you know, we chatted about a lot of things. The wine's good. Glad to hear it. You're quite the cook. Thank you. How's the chicken? Is that all right? Outstanding. You take the living room. Hey, hey, I gotta talk to you. Stay the fuck away from me. - Lucas, please. - Hey, hey, hang on. Just, I... Look, did Clay... Did he really do what you said he did? I heard you guys talking. Oh, shit. - Ah, shit. - Please leave me alone. Henry, Henry, listen to me. I... I am so sorry. Really, no one should have to go through that, ever. I... I mean that. Look, I just need to know why you told Clay that you hurt him. I can't deal with this right now. Please, I ha... I need to know. Did you lie about the Millers? Yes, I fucking lied! Your dad drove me to their fucking farm and would not let me leave until I... I can't deal with this. But Magic won almost twice as many titles. No, titles are for teams. You always gotta pay attention to the personal stats. Bird had way more points per game, more rebounds, better three-point percentage... The better free-throw player... Greatest player of all time, in my opinion. Seriously, better than Jordan? Yeah, Jordan sucked. I think you've had enough. - You put Bird... - Oh, Dad... Oh, shit! - Hey. - It's all right, it's all right. - Jesus. - It just slipped. Put some pressure on it. Use the napkin. - Maybe we should go. I'm gonna take him home. No! We have a... We have a first aid kit in the kitchen. No, that's fine. We have stuff that we can fix it with at home. I'll do it! I'll do it! I can take care of it. - Clay! - No, Henry. I've got it. I'll take care of it. Just go in the kitchen. - Um, no, no, let me do it. Let me, let me. - It'll be all right. I found it. Put it back. But this is proof. We should reconsider Bill's offer. Let's agree to meet. Fucking stings. Hey. Are we cool? Jesus, Henry, I don't get you. You freak out on me last night, you ask me to come over today. Now you're ignoring me. Is this like a game? Are you getting off on this or what? There, fixed. Ow. Hey, you know, I wouldn't mind an apology. For last night. I'm sorry, what did you say? It's pretty fucked-up to accuse someone of something they didn't do, so I said I'd like an apology. Something you didn't... And Henry, I have enough shit going on in my life right now without you spreading rumors, you know, about me. You understand? - You fucking piece of shit! - Whoa. I want to know how you do it. I want to know. I want to know how you can live with yourself. Just calm down. Hey, Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry? - Henry! - Mom, please... What's wrong? Please, Mom, stay away from me. - Please. - Henry, sweetheart, stay with me. I can't... I can't breathe, Mom. Baby, I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here. Listen, I tried, I tried. Save your energy, baby. Don't talk. I tried. I have to. - No, you don't. - I have to. Clay, in his truck, he... he forced himself on me and he forced himself... He forced himself? I don't understand. He... he hurt... He hurt me, Mom. Mom... - Henry, no. - I can't... - Henry... - I can't breathe... Henry! Henry! Henry! Thomas! Thomas! I've got you, baby. Cleo, what? - Thomas! Help me! Oh, my God, baby.
