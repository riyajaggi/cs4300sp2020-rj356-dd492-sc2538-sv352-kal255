 (CHOPIN'S FANTAISIE-IMPROMPTU PLAYING ON PIANO) (EXHALES) (SIGHS) JUDGE: You may begin your second piece when ready. Please proceed. (SOFTLY) Of course. Dad. Say that again? Is everything okay? MR. KIDO: The LIGO picked it up? Where? NICOLAI: Hey.

 Elaine. They're asking for you. MR. KIDO: Oh, fantastic. The first piece... perfect. Gotta get back in there. MR. KIDO: That's great news. He doesn't give a shit. NICOLAI: Of course he does. Come on. This is it. You need to focus. MR. KIDO: Let me call you back. We found one in Mexico City. You sure? MR. KIDO: Can you go tonight?

 Of course. ELAINE: But, Dad, can you just... We'll send a car for you. OFFICIANT: Excuse me, Miss Kido? Dad, please? You know how rare this is. Nikolai. Miss? Others are waiting. You must finish now. Please. Go back inside. You'll be great. OFFICIANT: Miss Kido? Wait. I'm coming with you. MR. KIDO: Elaine. What I'm doing here, this... It doesn't matter. What you and Nikolai are doing is, is real, is meaningful. How could anything be more important? I wanna help. Please? Let me be a part of this. (SIGHS) You understand the commitment you're making? Yes. No tears. (SMOOCHES) Hmm? (SNIFFLES) If it weren't for the brilliant vision of my father, who has been such an inspiration... If it weren't for my father, a true visionary, none of this would've been possible. (PEN SCRATCHING) No, that's not right. That's not right. Why are you here? I'm checking in. Is everything okay? ELAINE: And the girl, Henrietta? NICOLAI: Henry. Right. What did she think of her room? She trusts me now. Good. I'm excited to meet her tomorrow. I set up a monitor in Dad's room so he can watch the demonstration. Elaine, you don't need to rush this. If something goes wrong, there's no going back. It won't. I promised him. Now, please. If it weren't for my father, a true visionary, none of this would've been possible. As my father always says, "The only failure in science is failure of imagination." (CAN RATTLING) (SPRAY WHOOSHING) (STILL CORNERS' FADE OUT PLAYING) (CAN RATTLING) WOMAN: ♪ I rinsed after the rain ♪ Like a dream retrieved (SIGHS HEAVILY) ♪ Switching through trees ♪ Ah ♪ (FOOTSTEPS THUNKING) JENNA: (MUFFLED) You got to be quiet. (WHISPERING) I'm really excited about tomorrow. (NORMAL VOICE) The limo's picking us up at 7:00, okay? (SMOOCHES) (FOOTSTEPS THUNKING) HENRY: Shouldn't you be in bed? God, Henry. (DOOR CLOSES) (WHISPERING) I thought you weren't into him. I... I'm not. I just... Okay, whatever. I just wanted to be sure. What are you doing up there? It reeks of fumes. I'm trying something. Okay, well, you shouldn't sleep up there. You'll die, literally. I'm not sleeping in your sex bed. We didn't have sex, okay? We didn't do anything, really. Mmm-hmm. (LAUGHS) Jenna. (BREATHING SHAKILY) Heavenly Father, grant me... Grant me... (INHALES) (WHIMPERS) (SOBS) BARTENDER: Another round? Sure. Thanks. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO) (LAUGHS SOFTLY) (LAUGHS SOFTLY) (GASPING) (MOANS) - Wait, wait, wait. - Okay. What? (BOTH PANTING) Leave it up. (BOTH MOANING) (PANTING) What is it? Are you okay? (BOTH MOANING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO) MAN ON TV: And that was. That was the thing. He was always there for me. (INDISTINCT COMMENTARY ON TV) Uh, hey, excuse me. Can you go back? Yeah, sure. So I can't give up. I got to do everything I can to find him. The search is still underway for Bill Boone, the local Reston man accused of shooting at least one woman. There are no significant leads, but the sheriff's department remains hopeful. In the meantime, the quiet town of Reston... THOMAS: ♪ La-da-da-da-da ♪ Love is in the air ♪ See? They're supposed to be hearts. Think I got a couple of good ones in there. Oh, what's this? This is different. They're hearts. Oh. Yeah, in honor of the big dance tonight. (UTENSILS THUNK) Aren't, uh... Aren't you going? - Ha. - No. You know, Henry, I know you think that dances are "wack"... - (LAUGHS) - Or whatever, but, You know, this is really the only chance you get to make these memories. Yeah, or I could do anything else. Hey, honey. Happy dance day. Thanks. (DOORBELL RINGS) Oh, I'll get that. You sleep okay? (SIGHS) Not really. Too excited about tonight? Townes. Hello, Ms. Coles. How is your shoulder? Oh, it's getting better. Thank you. Townes, do you want some love cakes? I-I don't understand what that means, but definitely not. Thank you. I need to talk to Henry in private if that's all right. HENRY: Yeah. Yeah, we can go to my room. Would you open a window, please? Paint fumes cause brain damage. Yeah, yes. (WINDOW CREAKS) So are you okay? Yes, that's better. (FOLDERS CRINKLING) Townes, Jenna told me what happened... This is all my teleportation research, dream analysis, map data, and hacker correspondence. Okay. As of 9:07 a.m., I'm officially resigning as your sidekick. - Townes... - You should know Nikolai is not a good person. He's... he... He's a murderer. The hacker told me. You can't just listen to whatever Nikolai tells you. I'm not. That's not what I'm doing. - It's not like that. - You need to find out who he really is... A Yoda or a Lando. A real mentor or a fake ally. It's a crucial difference. That's what... What I would say to you if I was your sidekick, which I am not. Townes, this is crazy. I'm... Look, I still need your help. I'm getting better at this, but I still have no idea what I'm doing. It's not crazy. And it's not about you. Uh, I would say "good luck," but some people think that causes bad luck. I'm sorry I couldn't do more. (SIGHS) (SNIFFLES) (LINE RINGS) WOMAN: The person you are trying to speak to is not available. Please leave a message at the... (METALLIC RATTLING) (WHOOSHING) (PANTING) (LAUGHS SOFTLY) (GRUNTING) (FAINT PANICKED SHOUTING) (FEET RUSTLING) (WATER PATTERING) NICOLAI: I tracked down an old freelancer. He hacked a computer, looking to get to the girl, wanted to meet her. I'm aware. That's why I took care of it. Just tell the cleanup crew to get on it. Yes, I know they have names. The guy on the recording claims to be Ken Davidson, Bill Boone's insurance adjuster. - Claims to be? - (SIGHS) Well, he's talking about a murder, about cleaning up a body. I just heard a guy who deals with messes getting a mess cleaned up. What about the girl he's referring to? Office romance. Look, Anna, I like you. I do. But you're not a cop anymore. And now you're breaking into motel rooms, illegally recording people. At least I am doing something. You should be looking for John Does. Bill's body has to be somewhere. Now there could be a second vic. I mean, have you checked hospitals? - Have you checked morgues? - Why should I? 'Cause you got a hunch? The blood in Cleo's dining room is not a hunch. It's inadmissible. Doesn't make it any less real. Do you understand what sort of position you're putting me in here? Hey... What the hell? I got Karen Dale up my ass, all right? I'm doing us both a favor. You should be looking for leads, not erasing evidence. It's not evidence. It's illegal. Anna. (SIGHS) Mano a mano? Maybe think about talking to somebody... you know, about whatever it is you got going on. (WHEELCHAIR RATTLING) (ELEVATOR WHIRRING) I'll meet you inside. Where the hell have you been, huh? I've been calling you. I've been texting you every day. I needed you. Look, I just found out about Dad on the news. - Have you heard from him? - No, Lucas. He disappeared like you did. Everyone fucking left me with Mom. Look at this stupid shit she's making me wear. It fucking itches. What, you're staying with her now? Our house burned down. Where have you been? What? Yeah, there's nothing left. Fuck, man. I... (STAMMERS) Clay, I... shit. Okay, I'm sorry, man. I sh... I should've been here. I... I don't think Dad's coming back. I don't... I don't think he's even alive. No, I... Well, man, on the news, they said they're still looking for him. Fuck what they say. They only believe what that bitch tells them. Henry. She's got the whole town snowed. And you were right about her. (LAUGHING) She can do some shit. She's got this fucking thing, this special... I don't know. I don't know. Listen, I was in the house while it was burning down, okay? And Henry found me, and then she, like, held on to me, and then the chair started... She crushed it with her mind or some shit. And then we weren't even in the fire anymore. We were in her room. She saved you? No. She did it to fuck with me. She wants me to suffer. Listen, I know you tried to warn me about her. You tried to tell me what she could do, and I didn't fucking listen, but... You believe me, right? I think Dad did, too. It's got to be why he went to her house, and something happened to him. I can feel it. She did something. - Clay... - Lucas, you know him. He wouldn't just leave us like that. He wouldn't walk away. Not from me. You got to stop her. Promise me you'll stop her. (SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING) (MACHINE JAMS) Shit. (FOOTSTEPS THUNKING) Hey. You okay? Um, I, uh, keep trying to fix this lace, and I keep messing it up. My mom knew how to do this kinda stuff. I should've listened more. You know, when she tried to show me. Well... (CLEARS THROAT) I can't sew, like, at all, but I think I could help. Okay, this is, like, my secret weapon since probably the real Y2K. (LAUGHS) (JENNA LAUGHS SOFTLY) Aww. Your mom made this. It's so beautiful. She was very talented. Thank you. So this tape should hold for tonight, and then we should probably take it to somebody who really knows what they're doing. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) I know this is hard and things with your dad have been a little off lately, and he could definitely be more open sometimes, but I'm here if you need me. Whenever. Always. I know. But it's not my dad. I mean, he's not the problem. (SNIFFLES) It's like, I... I thought I knew who I was, but I feel like I'm losing myself or something. I mean, I don't know what I want at all really, and tonight... Jenna, you don't have to go to this dance tonight if you don't want to. You know that, right? But Zach is such a great guy. I mean, he's... he's so sweet and nice. And he's... (LAUGHS SOFTLY) He's like the perfect boyfriend. And he's really looking forward to tonight. But you don't wanna go with him. He... He planned his suit to match the color of my dress, and he ordered a limo, and he got me a corsage with lilies because he knows that I like lilies and... Listen, Zach is gonna look great in his suit whether you're standing next to him or not. And the limo and the lilies... Those are just things. And I know that you don't necessarily want advice from some old lady who happens to look really good for her age, but the thing that I've learned as I've tried to grow up myself is you got to do what's right for you. That guy, doesn't matter. He's not important. You're important. You got to listen to your gut and... And follow your instincts. Trust them. They won't lie to you. Thank you for helping me. Of course. Only wish I could've fixed it for real. It's okay. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Excuse me. WOMAN: Uh, just one sec. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) Deputy, how can I help you? I need reports, and I need John Does from the last week. Okay. Can I get your... Hulce. H-U-L-C-E. Badge 1505. Uh, nothing in the past week. And Lewis County? Uh, one moment. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) (FOREBODING MUSIC) - (SOFTLY) Ortez? - What's that? - Ma'am, ma'am. - Hey. Hey! Wait! What is this? How are you here? MAN: What the hell are you doing? I thought you were... Fuck. Fuck, I'm sorry. I thought... I thought I knew her. Sorry. (BREATHING SHAKILY) FISHER: Anna. Hey. What is all this? What are you doing in uniform? (EXHALES) (LINE RINGS) ZOE: Hey, I'm on, but I don't see you. You ready to play? Actually, I suspended my profile. What? Why? Are you okay? It's a distraction from the rest of my life, and... And it's not good for me anymore. Our game? That's... That's not true. I've relieved all my amulets and provisional reserves to the group well. You should take them. You'll need them to defeat the Divine Order. You earned those amulets. It's stupid to give them up. And this is our thing. If you're done with this, then what does that mean? Like, are you breaking up with me? I didn't say that. But it sounds like you don't wanna spend time with me. I... I need to focus on aspects of my life that don't involve fantasy. But we talk every day. I'm real. My therapist says I have trouble identifying what is real and what is fiction. I need to keep those things separate. Can we talk more later? Not tonight. Ms. Aguilar is making me work the door at the dance to make up for my tardiness. Okay. Well, I love you, Townes. You know that, right? I have to go. (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Um, Nikolai? W-where is, uh, Nikolai, um... - Oh. - Today? I-I came here looking for him. Do... Do you know where he is at all? Um... How... How... how long do you know Nikolai? (LAUGHS) Um... (LAUGHS) Uh... Oh. Okay. Cool. (SHUTTER CLICKS) (PHONE BLIPS) (CELL PHONE BUZZING) NICOLAI: What are you doing? Oh, I'm curing a hangover. Where have you been? Busy, Henry. I thought you'd enjoy not hearing from me. (CLICKS TONGUE) Okay. So are we cool? I mean, like, with your sister or whatever? NICOLAI: I told you I'd handle it, and I am. Stay close to home. I might need to find you later. Aren't you even, like, a little bit impressed that I... (LINE CLICKS) Hello? (SIGHS) May I, uh... Oh, yeah. Nikolai. HENRY: Holy shit. (DANIELA SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Did they, um... Uh, a-are they dead? Yes. In a church. (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Nikolai. (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Good, um... Good friend. Yeah. (CHUCKLING SOFTLY) (WHOOSHING AND THUMPING) (CHANDELIER RATTLES) (FOOTSTEPS THUNKING) Hey. Why aren't you at the dance? I'm not going. Why? Because I broke up with Zach. What? When? - Like, today? - Yes. Jenna, you broke up with him the day of the dance? That's amazing. Stop. You should go. No, I'd run into him. - It would be awkward. - So? Zach gets to go to the dance but you don't? Fuck that. I'm not going to the dance by myself, Henry. Fine. I'll go with you. I will. I'll be, like, your date or whatever. Henry, you hate dances. Yeah, I hate a lot of things, but I don't hate you, so... Henry. Jenna. Are you serious? I really wanna go to the dance. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) Okay. (LAPTOP CLATTERS ON TABLE) I'm gonna go get ready. Okay. (LAUGHS) Oh, you have to change, too. I'm... - Cleo. - (SHUTTER CLICKS) Ah. It works. Not to sound like our kids, but we have phones for that. - What? We do? - (CAMERA BEEPS) - (MUTTERS) - You look good. I look better in... I thought Zach was picking her up. - Shh, not now. - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (BOTH GASP) Oh, my God. You look amazing. So beautiful. (THOMAS LAUGHS) Aww, come here. Oh, your mom would be so happy. Honey, look at you. (RELUCTANTLY ) Okay. Let's go. THOMAS: No, no, no, no. Not yet. You two get over there. Come on. Let's go. CLEO: (SIGHS) Big smiles, come on. You too, Cleo, beside Henry. Okay, guys, can we... Shut up. Shut up, shut up. Okay, all right. Come on, quick, quick. You know your phone has a camera, right? (LAUGHTER) (SHUTTER CLICKS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) This is gonna be fun. It's gonna be something. (BRITNEY SPEARS' YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY PLAYING IN DISTANCE) Hello, Henry. Hello, Jenna. I know who you are, but I still need to see your IDs. You have a good ID photo. Thanks. So I'll see you in there? No, you won't. I-I have to keep the line moving. Okay. ♪ More than anything I ever felt before ♪ You drive me crazy ♪ I just can't sleep ♪ I'm so excited ♪ I'm in too deep ♪ Whoa, crazy ♪ But it feels all right ♪ Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night Oh. ♪ Oh, oh What's up? Zach and I still match. Oh, who cares? I do. A little. He's fine. He's with Patty and, um, what's-his-name. - Damian. - Sure. ♪ That I'm not wasting my feelings on you Okay, they are definitely talking about me. Oh, yeah. But whatever. The world is ending. (LAUGHS) ♪ You drive me crazy - Oh, shit. Incoming. - JENNA: What? Jenna, can we talk? In private? Uh, sure. ♪ Crazy - C... - Oh, yeah. I'll be fine, just be here with the Backstreet Boys. ♪ Keeps me up all night ♪ Crazy ♪ I just can't sleep ♪ I'm so excited ♪ (LIT'S MY OWN WORST ENEMY PLAYING) I don't consume sugar after 5:00. It's just an excuse to say hi. Batman has a sidekick, right? Like, Batboy or something? You're gonna make me lose count. And when his sidekick is in trouble, Batman is supposed to save him. That's a huge oversimplification but technically correct. I should've been there for you... The way that you're always there for me. Um, I was just really, like, caught up in my own shit, and I know that that sucks, and... I'm really sorry. I'm not gonna change my mind, if that's what you want. No, that's not... That's not what I want. You were a really great sidekick, Townes. But I'm obviously just, like... (LAUGHING) Kind of a... a shitty superhero. I think maybe that I could be a better friend, if you want. Like, we could be friends. Probably sounds, like, really dumb. (LAUGHS) Nothing you said sounds dumb. Except "Batboy." That's ridiculous. (BOTH LAUGH SOFTLY) Why didn't you call me? I had to find out from Damian. Damian. It was embarrassing. I'm sorry. I'm your best friend, Jenna. I'm here for you whenever you need to talk through these kinds of things. Oh, I didn't know I needed your permission to break up with him. Don't be crazy. That's not what I'm saying. Then why are you always pushing us together and talking about going on double dates? Because I wanna hang out with you. I feel like I never see you anymore. (SIGHS) And it's not like I'm gonna join the science club. But you're always with Henry and Townes Linderman. And let's be honest, neither of them are super easy to get along with. (SCOFFS SOFTLY) Look, you don't need to come up with excuses to hang out with me. And... I like that our friendship is different than what I have with them. Really? Really. (BOTH LAUGH SOFTLY) I just want you to be happy. (GOO GOO DOLLS' IRIS PLAYING ) Thank you, Ms. Aguilar. You're welcome. Are you gonna head in? No, I don't like crowds or loud music or special effects lighting. ♪ And all I can taste is this moment ♪ And all I can breathe is your life ♪ And sooner or later, it's over ♪ I just don't wanna Hello. Hi, Townes. Zoe? I thought I would, you know, 'cause we had said before. I wanted to finally meet you IRL. I hope this is okay. Yes, yes, of course it is. It's... nice to meet you. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) I like your hair. Even without the bangs. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) Thanks. Is there somewhere we can talk? (DOOR CLICKS) - This is the computer lab. - (DOOR CLOSES) I took code programming last year as an elective. I got an A. Cool. (ENERGETIC HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) (CHAIR CLATTERING) This is awkward. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) I'm sorry. Oh, it's not your fault. I'm just not used to looking at you when we talk. Right. (ZIPPER SCRATCHES) (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) (PHONE CLICKS) The theme from Divinity: Original Sin II. Pretend we're in our rooms. (BELL TOLLS) I'm sorry I suspended my profile. I understand why you did it. You do? Yeah, I know you've been off track. I guess I just don't want you to give up on... all the fantasy in your life. I mean, your imagination's one of the things I love most about you. Is that why you came here tonight? (BREATHES DEEPLY) I messed up before when I didn't met you at your science award ceremony. That was a really big deal. I just... I was scared to see you and for you to see me. Is it because of your arm? Because I think it's very impressive. I've never seen anything like it before. It makes you different in a good way. You think so? Yeah. (CHAIRS CLATTERING) Good. 'Cause it doesn't bother me either. Never has, really. It's just annoying how uncomfortable it makes people sometimes, the way they look at me, like it's all that I am. Yeah, I... I know what you mean. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) This is the best dance ever. (BOTH LAUGH SOFTLY) (LAUGHS) (JENNIFER LOPEZ'S WAITING FOR TONIGHT PLAYING ) ♪ Like a movie scene ♪ In the sweetest dreams ♪ I have pictured us together - Let's dance. - (MOUTH FULL) Oh, no.

(LAUGHS) Jenna. HENRY: Oh, no. He's drunk. (CLEARS THROAT) Um, can I... can I have this dance? I don't think that's a good idea. I don't get it. I don't. Did I do something wrong? No. No, it's not you. Zach, you're making this, like, a lot worse than it has to be. I'm not talking to you, Henry. Jenna, I just wanted tonight to be perfect for us, okay? I... I love you. - Okay. - Uh... I just want to get back with you, okay? So just, just tell me what to do. And I'll do it. Dude, stop. - I'll do anything. - Someone needs a water. No, wait, Jenna... You can talk to her later, if she wants to talk to you. - Zach: Patty... - Walk with your legs, come on. - (STAMMERS) - Come on. ZACH: No... Sometimes she sucks less than you'd think. ♪ Fall in love with me ♪ If ever I believe Are you okay? ♪ My work is done ♪ Then I start back at one ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ It's so incredible ♪ The way things work themselves out Zach's gonna be fine. And you're gonna be fine. It's not... It's not about Zach. None of this feels right. And I... I think maybe I always knew it didn't. I don't know. Jenna, you can tell me what's going on. You wouldn't understand. I tell you all of my shit. And I have some seriously crazy, fucked-up shit.

Like, so much cooler. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) That was both easier and harder than I thought it was gonna be. And... I haven't told anyone else. Well, thank you for telling me. Don't say anything. Of course not. ♪ Three, girl, it's plain to see ♪ That you're the only one for me ♪ And four, repeat steps one... ♪ (DOOR BUZZES) You made bail. Hey. I fucked up. Yeah.

And now... here we are. You said... You'd help me. And you did. You kept your promise. (GRUNTS) But you did nothing for her. (SIGHS HEAVILY) - (SWITCH CLICKS) - (MACHINE POWERS DOWN) Wesley asked me to look after her. But I watched you... chip away at everything she was, to make her more like you... Like us. (GROANING) (WHIMPERING) I can't, uh... (SIGHS) I can't do that anymore. (WHIMPERING) (GROANS) (GASPING) I need to stop it. (GASPING RAPIDLY) I'm sorry. (EXHALES SLOWLY) (MUSIC PLAYING THROUGH HEADPHONES) LUCAS: Henry. I hope she didn't make it too hard for you. Nikolai? Henry Coles isn't coming. What are you talking about? The demonstration is in a few hours. There isn't gonna be a demonstration or any more tests. It's over, Elaine. We're done. That means no more Factor. You'll die. (LAUGHS) Yeah, well, maybe I should've died a long time ago. If I did, things might've been different for you, for a lot of people. You can't give up now, not when we're so close to achieving Dad's goal. Wouldn't be enough. Not for him, not for you. You're wrong. I work hard for him. He respects that. There's still time for you to have a life on your own terms. Without him. What the fuck are you talking about? What did you do? What you couldn't. (RAPID FOOTSTEPS) ELAINE: Dad? Dad! No. (SOBBING) No. No! Wake up. Wake up! (SOBBING) Wake up! (SOBBING) Wake up! No! LUCAS: My brother told me everything... That you crushed him in his truck... And you took him from the fire. And I think you probably know what happened to my dad, too. He's dead, isn't he? Leave me alone. I know what it's like to take a life. To live with the pain and the guilt of it. If you killed my dad, he probably deserved it, just like Clay deserved what he got. And yet you saved him. I just, um... I'm not here to judge you, Henry. I'm here to serve you. What? I've been searching, seeking guidance, and there is a plan for all of us. God has a plan. So there has got to be a reason for you... Oh, Lucas. For what you can do. Listen, my family, they're evil, and I know that. They're fucking rotten to the core. My dad and my brother, what they did to you? They treated you like nothing. They didn't see you. But I see you, Henry. I've never witnessed what you can do, but I believe it. I know you can do it. (LAUGHING ) That is what faith is. I see you for who you really are. (SCOFFING) I can't do this. You are an angel, Henry... (LAUGHS) On a mission from God. And it is my job to protect you. Henry? You don't need to say anything, not yet. Just know that I believe in you. You can count on me, and I'll always be here whenever you need me. ♪ Ah-ah-ah, Ah-ah-ah ♪ Ah-ah-ah ♪ ♪ ♪
