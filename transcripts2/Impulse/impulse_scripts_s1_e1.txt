 Your favorite. Can I take my car out after school? Yeah, as soon as I'm home from work. Can I go alone if I stay close to the house? No, no... not until the doctor says it's okay. Could you just please sit down and have a bite of those eggs that I slaved, like, three minutes in the kitchen over? You can't take your pills on an empty stomach. Well, she's not hungry 'cause she had herself a midnight snack. It's still sitting there. Do we need to have another talk about wasting? Uh, no, 'cause I plan on finishing this later. Did you go out last night? Um, just for some air. In the middle of the night? The air is out there all night long. I don't know what that means. You're talking about air? Why do I always have to take her to school? 'Cause she's family now. She's not family, Dad. Have a heart.

You're not wearing your spirit bracelet. - Ooh, I left it in the trash. Sorry. - Did you now? Um, I was wondering if you wanted to go to the game Friday. - What do you think? - Uh, I think if I keep asking you, you know, my odds are bound to go up, right? - Do you know that you've, like, struck out ten times already? For an athlete, your batting average is shit. - Yeah, well, you know, at least I play with heart, you know? And I'm not even, uh, a baseball player, lucky for me. - And now, a player who needs no introduction: number 32, Clay Boone! - Now what's up, Reston? Are you ready to kick the Rebels' ass this Friday? Give me a W... - W! - Give me an A... - A! - Give me an R... - R! - Give me another R! - R! - Give me an I... - I! - Give me an O... - O! - Katy, good work. You got a B plus. Townes, you got an A, again. Townes? Townes. Hey! Townes. - Uh, someone took my pen. - Oh, come on. Not this again, Townes. - Who took my blue pen? My blue pen was stolen. - Townes... - My blue pen was right here. - Earth to Townes! Sit down. - My blue pen... - Sick of you disrupting my class. - Someone stole my pen. - Sit your ass down before I tape it to your chair. - My blue pen was stolen. - I don't care about your pen. Take a seat. - It was stolen! - Look, you have a black pen, you have a red pen. You have two pens! - It was stol... - Sit down! - I have a question for you, Shelly. Why do we have to call you "Doctor"? You're not actually a PhD, are you? I actually looked you up, Mr. Gibson. You did your post-grad at the University of Cincinnati, right? - Young lady, choose your next words very carefully. - Well, they publish their doctoral dissertations online. - Okay, you know what? That's enough. - Your Master's is there. It's a rambling piece of shit but it's there. - Principal's office, now. - I just, like... it's odd that I couldn't find your dissertation - You know what? Get to the principal. - Don't touch me, dude. - Let's go. Get out of my classroom. Out of my class- - I said don't... dude! - Miss Coles, get out of my classroom. Uh, Miss Coles? Miss Coles? Uh... Oh, Jesus. Uh... Sit down. But... just... Everybody just give her some space. Oh, God. Oh, shit. Stay back. Jesus Christ. Uh, please call someone. Uh... oh, God. Um... somebody... Somebody call the nurse. - This is Henrietta's second myoclonic seizure in eight months? - Actually, it's her third. She had one at the house, but it was over so quickly that we didn't bring her in. - I noticed that you left some of the questions blank here. If we want to get to the bottom of these episodes, it would be helpful if we had her father's medical history. - Henry's father left when she was a little girl. - Is there any other family on his side we could track down? - I'm sorry, no. - Okay, we're going to up the dosage of Henry's Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine. Lucy at the front desk can help you out with that. - Okay. - Um, can I... What's going to happen with my license? - Oh, yeah, Henry was hoping that she could get her license back next month. - I'm sorry. Unfortunately, that's not going to be possible. I have to file with the DMV this afternoon. - Um, but the... The doctor last time said that we could just not tell the DMV for now, and we could wait. - It's better for everyone if you didn't drive, including you. If we can get these seizures under control, you can re-apply for your license in three years. - ♪ A right for a right a wrong for a wrong ♪ ♪ Was clearly not life's design ♪ ♪ Figure out quickly that nothing gets answered ♪ ♪ When you ask the universe why ♪ ♪ Life is a journey to live is to worry ♪ ♪ To love is to lose your damn mind ♪ ♪ But living's a blessing so I'm not stressing ♪ - You'll get tired before I run out of gas, honey. Evening. We've had, uh, a rash of incidents lately. Buddy Neil's RV, a billboard last night, uh, a school bus. - I'm so sorry, officer. What were you thinking? - You told me it was important to express myself. - Don't be a smartass. You know that's not what I meant. - You know, in most places, tagging is considered an art form. - You know what? Here, it's considered a felony. - Look, I'm not looking to lock anyone up, folks. If she pays a fine, promises not to do it again, I don't have to bring her before the judge. - Thank you so much. I promise she will. - Yeah, this will not happen again. You have my word. - Thanks for this. Can I speak to Henry a moment? - Yeah, of course. - I know what it feels like to be the new girl in town, believe me. This particular town doesn't do newcomers well. But Henry, you have to find other outlets. - You're not even trying, Henry. - Why should I? - Well, you know, this is a good opportunity for us, okay? We could really build a life here. I finally feel excited to come home to someone. - Mom... - What? - You've said that same thing about, like, the last five guys that you've dated. - That is not fair. - Yeah, it is. It is fair, because this is what you do. You find some guy, you get sick of him, and then I have to move to a new fucking town, and we have this conversation every six months. - Okay, was Burlington my fault when you stole that motorcycle? - What about Newton? We had to leave in the middle of the night because of Phil the asshole. That wasn't because of me. - Okay, you know what? You're right, all right? But we've both made some mistakes, and... this is different. Thomas is a good and honest man. Okay. Your father is not the person that you think he is. He was never around. He just came and went as he pleased. I never had any idea what was happening. - I didn't ask you about Dad, so... - Good night. - Hey. - We paid for two trailers. I'm only seeing one. - Yeah, one of the drivers lost his passport, and he's stuck in Ottawa, so... - Why am I only hearing this just now? - Sorry, Pop. I'll take care of it. - No, you won't. You had your chance to take care of it. Now I'm gonna take care of it. - Yes, sir. - Um... what the fuck? Um... hi. - Hey. - What are you doing? - We're selling your car, Henry. - Why? - You heard the officer last night. There's a fine to be paid and your car is gonna pay for it. - But I'm... I'm gonna pay the fine. I've said that I will pay the fine. I'm gonna pay the fine! - Really? Really? With what money? I don't got it. - Mom! Mom! Mom? Mom. - There have to be consequences for your actions. Don't fight us on this. - But I-I said that I would pay the fine. - We made a decision, and that's final. I'm sorry. - You know what the worst thing about this car is? Nothing. It's awesome. - Well... now you're stuck being my chauffeur for the rest of the year, so... Don't know why you're so happy. - ♪ See me sadness when we laugh ♪ ♪ When we quiet hear me work ♪ ♪ Feel me love and watch me ♪ ♪ Pull me switch drag me over ♪ ♪ Know me hard when me soft ♪ ♪ Know me scared when me talk tough ♪ ♪ Go get them guts go get them guts ♪ ♪ Cut then cut up your sleeve ♪ - So freaking cool. Looks like an ancient symbol. - Yeah, it's, like... Chinese? I think. - Patty, your mom's gonna kill you. - Yeah, she's not even gonna know. Hi. Hi, can I help you? - Your sister isn't coming with us on Saturday, is she? - She's not my sister, and no. - Did you guys hear what happened last night? Michelle Reilley said that Clay hooked up with Tracy Stafford. - Brenda... - Sorry, Patty. - Why? You guys think I want Clay Boone back? Yeah, those sluts can have him. - Did you know that there are six different kinds of generalized seizures? Your affliction interests me. I'm doing some research on the matter. - No talking in detention. - My pens began to move when your seizure started. So did other objects in the room. It was an abnormal occurrence. Do you have a brain tumor? - Not that I know of. - I was hoping you had a brain tumor. Brain tumors can cause psychic episodes. - Shh. - I didn't cause things in the room to move. - How do you know? - Because no one can cause things in a room to move. - Well, I don't believe that to be true. - Shh! You're crazier than I am. Do you know that? - Swing the ball. Swing the ball. Whoo! Good edge. - Hustle, Clay, hustle! - That girl I was telling you about? She's got a sister. Her name's Candace. She goes to, uh, New Rochelle. She's a freshman. - Oh, that girl has no idea what she's in for. - Stop talking, Clay, God damn it! - What are you guys talking about? - Shut up, Munther. - Cut the chatter out there. - Focus. Rebound, rebound. - Whoo! - Yeah! - Move the ball, move the ball. - One of my drivers got stuck in Ottawa. Dipshit lost his passport. - Yeah, I'll... I'll take care of that. - Thanks. Stay on him! Come on, Clay! You dummy! - I didn't raise a pussy, but that's how you're playing out there, like a goddamn pussy. You got rocks in your head? Huh? I told you to drive and keep driving. I didn't even recognize you out there. Where's the killer instinct? - Dad, it's just practice. - You play like you practice. You understand? - Unh! - We got to get you there. That's what needs to happen. - Uh, C-Clay? Clay! Can I talk to you? - Hey. - Hi. - 'Sup? - I need a favor. - Okay. What's the favor? - I need to steal a car. - You need to steal a car? Okay, um... You ever stolen a car before? - Yeah, actually. - So then, if you're so experienced, why do you need my help? - It's parked in your dad's lot. - Yeah, I think I can help you. - Yeah? Okay, meet me after school. - Okay. Hey, Gale. - Hey there, Clay. - Dad know you're down here? - Jesus. Scared the hell out of me, man. - What are you doing? - Um... Nothing. I'm just... - Just what? - Just borrowing a car. - Why are you in the pink slip drawer, then? - Uh... - Okay. Never mind, hotshot. I don't want to know. - Am I the man, or what? - Thank you. Uh... Thank you. - Yeah. - Hi, babe. - Hi! Dan Garvey's kid just spilled split pea soup all over me. Just chucked it at me. What? What is it? - Henry never came home after school. - Oh, shit. - Mark Weiner said she skipped detention. - She's out of control. - Don't... I called her twice. It just goes to voice mail. - Honey, what, uh... what are you doing? - She is not getting past me tonight. - Hello. - Hi. - Thank you for this. - Yeah, any time. You know, I think we make, actually, a pretty great team. What should we steal next? So, uh, let me ask you something. What's your deal? - Like... like, why are you always alone? - Um... I like being alone. - No one likes being alone. - Yeah, well, you would think that. - So, now all of a sudden you know me? - Think everybody kind of knows you. - Okay. - A little bit. - Okay. Maybe they're wrong, though. Maybe I'm not what people say. - What is that? In your hair? - Oh, um... It's paint. It's spray paint. - Oh. Mm. Have I seen your work? - I don't know. Maybe. - Oh. - Yeah. Um... Ah. Hey. I think... I think I should actually go... - Go where? What are you talking about? Oh, okay. Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay. No, I'm... - Hey, don't worry. - I'm being serious. Ow! Clay! - I just want you to feel good. - That hurt! Ow! - Henry, calm down. Calm down. - Please, just get off of me. Ow, please, please, please. I'm asking you to please... No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, please, please, no. I don't want... please. Please, no. - See? - I... - See? You'll get wet soon. - Get the f... Get the fuck off of me! - Jesus, Henry, what's your problem? - Get the fuck off of me! - Henry, just stay. What the... Holy... Jesus! Uh... - Henry? Are you up there? - Um... uh... yeah. - Henry? - Yeah. - Henry, is that you? How did you get in here? - Uh... Um... - Where have you been? - I-I don't... I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? Are you high? Look at me. - No. No, I'm not! I'm not... I'm just... Okay, just... just listen to me for a second, okay? I... - What the f... - Mom... I think something really strange happened. - What is... What has happened here? - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. - What happened to the wall? - Mom... Just... okay... - I just want to know if we should be expecting another knock on the door from the police tonight. - No. Um... No, that's not gonna happen tonight. I'm sorry. - It's perfect. - Yeah? You don't think it's, like, too big, or makes my ass look huge, or something? - No, it fits you perfectly. You look gorgeous. Excuse me. Knock, please. - Um... I-I need to borrow your car. - What does the freak want? - I don't know. - Jenna, where are your keys? - I... Dad! - Jenna! I need your help. - What is it, hon? - Nothing, Dad. Good night. - So, um, I... I was with Clay. - You were with Clay Boone? - Yeah, we were in his truck. Um... And we were kissing, and then he put his, um... He tried to... But I said no, and... But he wouldn't stop, and... - Henry... - Um... And then he put his hand on my leg, and then on... - Are you okay? - He put his hand down my... And... Um, and I said no, but he wouldn't... - Did he rape you? - No. I mean, if... if I hadn't, he... And then I ended up here, and I... I don't... I don't know how... I don't know how I'm here. - Did he roofie you? - No, he didn't roofie me. This is what I wanted to show you, because this... okay, this is the weird part. Let me just... Let me just show you. - What is that? - I think it's the door to Clay's truck. Well, how did it get here? - Just wait here. Oh... Hello, 911? Um, yeah, I need to report an accident. Get in the car. Jenna, please don't tell my mom or your dad, okay? - This is so messed up. - Might have been a deer. I seen a deer do stuff like this. - Did a deer take the door with him? And put away the beer, Randy. This is a crime scene. - Figure it was a hit and run? - Well, maybe, but where's the paint from the other vehicle? - Think you all should consider my deer theory. - Is my boy gonna play ball again, Doc? - Your son's a real fighter, Mr. Boone. He's got a very good shot at pulling through. That said, Clay's spine was fractured at the second lumbosacral vertebra. I am sorry, Mr. Boone. - What's going on? - The Boone kid had a car accident. - Poor kid was hurt really bad. - It was a hit and run. They got a suspect. - Did they say who? - God help the poor son of a bitch when Bill Boone gets his hands on him. - Hold on a second. I was at home last night. - You know, one piece of advice for you: shut up. - Hey. - Hey. - Local news picked up this arrest awfully fast, Sheriff. - Ah, Clay Boone's a popular kid in town. News travels fast. This son of a bitch got blind drunk at the lodge last night. - Hold on... - Just keep your mouth shut. Keep your mouth shut, you understand me? - Officer... - And then he plowed his truck right into Clay's. - I didn't know you lived in the trailer park, Eddie. - No... - No, no, his, uh... His mom's got a trailer over there. - Where's Eddie's car? Is it impound? 'Cause I'd love to take a look at it. - It ain't at the impound. It's a hit and run, okay? Case closed. - We need to just forget about last night, okay? - Hi. We are collecting donations to get Clay some flowers. - That's so sweet. - So sad about Clay. Thank you very much. - Certain types of seizures are recurring. Have you had another episode? - I've been dealing with some really weird shit, Townes. - Define "weird." - Something... something happened. Something, like, really strange happened. - Strange like what happened in the classroom? Did you move things with your mind again? - I-I don't... I don't really know what I did. - When did this happen? - Last night. - Hi. We're collecting donations to get Clay flowers. - You had an episode last night? - What is he talking about? - Nothing. Um... I-I actually don't have cash, Patty. Otherwise, I-I would. - Hi. Hello, Mr. Hope. Sorry to disturb you. I need to speak to Henry's mother. - She's not here right now. - May I come in? So, last night, around 11:00 p.m., there was a 911 call from Henry's phone. She reported Clay's accident. - Henry called in Clay's accident? I don't see how that's possible. - Well, it sure sounded like her on the call. - Officer, Henry was with us all night. - You sure? - Yeah, positive. She sat right there on that couch. - Henrietta Coles? Just the little lady I wanted to see. - Sorry, who are you? - I'm Clay's brother. Know he... took your car yesterday off the lot. - Yeah, I-I don't know anything about that. - No, I think you were with him. - I-I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry, man. - Hey, I need to talk to you. Are you kidding me right now? - Let's go. - But... - Jenna, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go. - I'm going. - Go, go, go. - I'm trying! Okay! - Shit. - What's wrong? - It's Clay's brother. - What does he want? - Shit! Jenna, drive. Jenna, drive, drive! - Okay, I'm going, I'm going. - Jenna, he's right beside us. - What do you want me to do? - Don't listen to him. - Pull alongside of the road. You're not getting away. - Henry, why is he following us? Hey, pull over! - Shit! - Fuck. I'm sorry. - Jesus, Jenna. - Shit. Are you okay? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - Um, okay. I'm gonna handle this, okay? - What do you... What do you mean? Henry, get back in the car. - Jenna, just go home. Go get help, okay? Go get help now. - Why'd you run away from me? I just wanted to have a conversation. - Well, I'm here. Let's converse. - You're the last person to see my brother before the accident. - Dude, I... I didn't see him. - You're trying to bullshit a bullshitter right now, because I know you're lying. - I'm not. I'm not lying to you. I'm not. - You sure? - Yeah. I don't... I don't know what you're talking... - Okay, you're coming and you're answering my questions. - Hey, hey! Don't touch me! Hey! Answer... shut up. - Help! - Shut up. - Let... - All right, you know what? - Help! Help! Let go of me! - Shut up. - Hey! Help! Help! Help! Let... let me out! Hey! Let me... Let me out! - Hey! Hey! Hey, stop! Stop! Cut it, Jorge! Cut the... cut the water! - Hey! Hey! Help! Hey! - Hey, don't worry about the vacuum. Hey, hey, just leave the car. Leave the car, Nick. I'll get it. Can you just go? Let's go! Lomo, you don't need to... Come on. Come on, let's move it, guys! Hustle! You have legs! Use your legs. Jorge, you got legs. Can you just not walk any faster? - Hey! Hey, I'm in here! Hey! - Are you listening to anything I'm saying? I'm giving you the rest of the afternoon off, okay? Everybody happy? Okay. Okay, Henrietta. No more fucking around. - Dad? Dad! Dad? Dad! - Hi.
