 Previously on The Shield: I went through the books. Mackey was talking to a drug dealer... - Name's Rondell Robinson. - Mackey's working for a drug dealer? The drug dealer's working for Mackey. - What do you get out of this? - A dirty cop off the street. You wanna be mayor some day? Better learn to lie a lot better than that. I came up the ranks with Vic. We can't be accused of whitewashing. Last thing this department needs... ...is to add another chapter to the Rodney KinglO.J. Book. I don't wanna be in that book. My source at Justice is all over me. He wants to know if you made us all accomplices to a murder.

 Terry got overeager. He got himself killed. - End of story? - End of story. - I know what you did. - Up until now I've tolerated you. Come near my men again, I'm gonna lose patience. - You listening? - I know. Damn, girl! That's what I'm talking about. Don't shake that in my man's face. - Who are all these white folk? - They're from the record label. Oh, yeah. Give me that, girl. Yeah. - How does she move like that? - That's what the guys like. Sir... You've had too much to drink. Who are you? - I'm a cop. - You undercover?

 Security. So behave yourself. Everybody put your hands together for all the ladies shaking it up in here. Word up! Word up, y'all. I wanna thank everybody for coming out to my album-release party. Back From the Ashes, you know what I'm saying? Feels good to be back behind the mike. Hey, Kern! - Do that duet with Tyesha. - Rondell in the house. Where Tyesha at? Where Tyesha at? Come here. This is Kern's party, y'all. My release party ain't gonna be for another month. - Trouble. - You can hear me sing then. - Tonight's Kern's night. - Where my money, Kern? Yo, there go the thief right there. I want my money, homey. Where my money, Kern? - Hey, yo. Hey, hey, hey. - I want my money. - My beef ain't with you, playboy. - What? - Lf it's with Kern, it's with me. - Hey, back up. This is a private party. You can't get into trouble. Do I have to call in the cavalry? Step back. Police can't protect you forever, Kern. Remember that. - Get out of here. Go. - It's T-Bonz, homey. - Punk ass out of here, man. - You heard me. Go. - Get lost, bitch. - Who you calling a bitch? Stay down! Shit! Danny, you all right? Hey, man, those fools were shooting up in here. - Lemon! - Somebody call 91 1! Rumble in the jungle. - What happened? - Two dead, six wounded. T-Bonz and his crew were looking for a fight. Rondell and some of Kern's guys gave it to him. - Don't tell me. - Rondell was the shooter. It's just what we needed. Hey. Hey, Vic. You're missing all the fun. Dutch, how many times I got to tell you, you can't feel up the witnesses. - Took one in the ass. Bet it's not... - It's not the first time. Good one. Look who's the last one to a "shots fired" call. All safe and secure, captain. Shooting stopped. Nothing to worry about here. You two were moonlighting? Our shift commander signed off on it. Any suspects in custody? Well, the night is young. Let me do my thing. Do you mind if I include others in this investigation? You sign the checks. Pete and Dutch team up. Strike Team will assist as they see fit. Any problems with that? Just that time's a-wasting. I won't put up with shooting galleries in Farmington. Find out who pulled the triggers and bring them in. Knute Rockne, he ain't. I may have to put up with you working under my roof... ...but it's still my roof. So just do your job... ...and stay out of my way. Sounds like good advice for both of us. Let's get to work. - The guy throwing the party... - Kern Little. And this T-Bonz, they weren't the shooters? - Not that I saw. Just their pals. - Can you ID any of them? - I can look through the books. - This will spill into the street quick. Let's talk to both generals, get them to stand down their armies. - Starting where? - Kern Little. - Who's Kern Little? - Listen, Dutchboy... ...don't get your clogs all dirty. We'll deal with Kern Little. - Who is it? - Open up, Rondell. - What's up, Vic? - Why'd you shoot up the Chez Club? Hey, man, T-Bonz and Kern got this war going on, man. - I'm just backing up my boy. - Who's that? Kern? - Hey, this thing high-def? - Yeah. Don't get your prints on it, man. Sweet. Look, me and Kern, we been hanging since we was kids. We're still tight. Don't you mean Kern financed your entry into the drug business? Yeah. No comment. But that's the rumor. What's the beef between Kern and T-Bonz? T-Bonz was on Kern's record label. Then he started selling a lot of discs. T-Bonz split, start his own outfit. Hey, bad blood ever since. - Hey, what's with all the vinyl here? - Hey, hey, hey, it sounds better. Would you put those back the way you found them? That's my Blue Note collection. I got them chronological from... - Did you hit anybody last night? - Look, if somebody got smoked... ...it wasn't me. I was just shooting to be shooting. Give me your piece. Come on, come on, just give it to me. Keep your dealers inside until I give the all clear. - I don't want more targets on the street. - Vic, man, come on. Business is gonna take a big hit. Then take it. You get to deliver product... ...only so long as this neighborhood doesn't resemble the Gaza Strip. Now, that was our deal. You remember? Yeah, I remember. Set up a meet. Me and Kern Little. - Man, why you need me to do that? - You two are buds. - I want it to be on friendly terms. - Anything else, man? Yeah. I need two shooters from your side. Oh, come on, man, you kidding. Come on, man. No. Is it gonna be you? And I run your gun through ballistics? Or you got some names for me? - Welcome to the Barn. - Make yourselves at home. Just doing my job. And staying out of your way. - You look great. - Stay focused. Now, he owns three different car dealerships. Him, a chain of grocery stores. There's more money here than in Mexico City. - Which one's Machado? - Right there. This whole thing is his baby. You better say hi before he disappears. - Okay. - Remember how we talked about it. - I'll wing it. - David... - I'm joking. - This could be your one chance. - You ready? - As I'll ever be. Se?or Machado. I'm David Aceveda. Our young police captain. Welcome. It's an honor to meet you. This is my wife, Aurora. What a wonderful housing development. It's a step forward in improving our neighborhood. - I'm glad you both could come. - Thank you for including us. I'm in your debt. Don't think me overly generous, David. As you'll discover, I often have ulterior motives. You see, you're actually in a position to help me. How so? My nanny hasn't seen her husband since he left the house a few days ago. He's a day-worker. Waits for jobs by the home improvement center in your district. Well, is this absence unusual for him? Not exactly. They are an emotional couple. They fight, he leaves, he comes back. But he has never been gone this long. My nanny's quite upset, which means my wife is upset, which means... I don't have to tell you what that means. Just give me the pertinent information. I'd be glad to help. Looks as if I am now in your debt. - You listening to this? - It's sweet. Sing me a song about last night. Man, that'd be a short-ass song. As soon as I seen them dudes coming with them big guns... ...I just got Tyesha the hell up out of there. Nice place. I told everybody my first studio gonna be in Farmington. You can't record a hardcore hip-hop song working in Bel Air. - You got to keep it in the 'hood, baby. - How am I sounding, baby? What? Like 2 million CDs, double platinum. - Tyesha, this is officer... - I'm Vic. Just call him Lemonhead. - Hey. - Hey. This is Rocco. It's a madhouse out there. How'd you get past all the photographers? We called ahead. Kern let us use the security entrance. Kern's not under arrest, is he? Unfortunately for those tabloid hacks, no. - We just needed a statement. - Which I gave. - And his help with this war. - Well, it's not Kern. It's his boys trying to protect him. T-Bonz is just plain crazy. Everybody knows that. Don't worry about T-Bonz, we'll deal with him. I need you to give the word to your crew. The war is over. Right after T-Bonz gives his word. I mean, T-Bonz's the one that spilled blood on my turf. I'm nothing if not a man of peace. Dutch? I'm running known associates on the shooters Mackey brought in. We ever getting DSL around here? This is Ellie Ruiz. I need you to help her out. - I'm working the Chez Club. - Shockley can handle it. I need you to help find Ellie's husband, Manuel. I can't believe we're doing this for some fat cat's nanny. - You'd be happier if it was a mistress? - It's abuse of power. Oh, you're upset you got pulled off a big case. We're Aceveda's errand boys. Meanwhile, watch him cash in on our hard work. So looking for a missing migrant worker isn't important? - You do all the talking. - Why me? You speak Spanish. How can you be a cop in L.A. For 1 2 years... ...and not speak any Spanish? - All my partners spoke Spanish. - Besides, I know a phrase or two. - Right. Yo no s? means "I don't know." You hear it enough, it sinks in. Missing hombre? Yeah. Manuel Ruiz? - There. - Hey, hey! Hey, hey. You, amigo. Amigo. What's your name? Come on. You wouldn't be sneaking away if you yo no s?'d. Now, you know Manuel, don't you? Yes. - Oh, I don't believe it! - What? Back up! Let's roll, man! Don't you make me break a sweat trying to catch you! What the hell are you doing out? - Business. - Rondell ordered you off the street. - No, not us. - Run on home. What I'm gonna tell the boss? I am the boss. - What I'm gonna tell Rondell? - Don't worry. I'll tell him for you. - What's up, man? - I saw two of your guys on the street. - Man, it's a free country. - Nothing's free. I'm your landlord, Rondell. I let you use space that I own. Now, you can't follow by my rules, then I'll find someone who can. - You got me? - I got you. Now, smart-ass, who else you got dealing and where? Manuel got picked for a job on Tuesday, along with another man. - Eduardo Salcido. - Salcido. Any connection between this Manuel and Eduardo? - They were best friends in Mexico. - Even snuck into the country together. Something happened on that truck ride. Ever since, Eduardo's been telling people he's gonna kill Manuel. We know who hired the two of them? - Truck logo said Jamison Contracting. - Well, track it down. Find out if they ever showed up for work. All units, code 2 1 3, intersection of Alvarado and Pine. That's our corner. Goddamn it! He had to leave his guys on the street! Punch it! Police! Down there. Call EMT! Oh, man. The mayor knows the little boy, Vic. You're shitting me. Belongs to his golf buddy's second cousin or some such thing. Whatever. He's invested. Any word on the kid's condition? He's busted up pretty bad. So I got nothing good to tell the chief. How do I explain these four dead thugs? A war. Two rappers. I know who they are. Look, I'm handling it. I told the chief the Strike Team would make a difference. That these things will stop. I'm not seeing the difference. Temporary setback. The chief allows me to appropriate funds for you based on results. If I can't defend you, I can't afford you. Vic. - Thought you should know. - Know what? Kid was DOA. I'm handling it. Knock, knock. Have a seat. - All right. - Tough guy. This war ends right here with a handshake. This fool stole my money and my woman... ...and you expect me to be a gentleman? - What, Tyesha was your woman? - Hell, yeah. - We're not signing autographs, ladies. - Okay. So basically, this is a dick-wagging contest over a piece of ass? This ain't about no piece of ass. - It's about $2 million that fool owe me. - Two million dollars? - What 2 mil? - Tyesha's money from the last CD. I broke her. Where my cut? First up, calm down, money. I'm a businessman. I can be fair. But $2 million, you must be smoking crack. I'll give you a finder's fee. Straighten you out. I'm doing your punk ass a favor. You owe me at least 1 0. You know what, T? I'm gonna keep it real with you. Tyesha wasn't even selling records till I hooked her up. And that's real. - Oh, is that real? - Hey, look, look, look. Your 1 0 lawyers can do battle with his 1 0 lawyers or we can settle this here. - I'm gonna get my money, bitch. - Over my dead body. - Damn, that sound like a good idea. - Shut up! Here's the deal. Kern, you take tonight, come up with a number. You revise yours down a bit. You bring me the numbers... ...l'll decide what's fair. And who you supposed to be? Judge Judy? I'm an impartial arbitrator with the power to throw your asses in the can. Now, I'm calling a 2 4-hour cease-fire. Your boys break it, I break you. Same goes for you. This war ends here. They come here of their own accord. Nobody's coercing them. Family of five moving to another country just to eat isn't coercion? You know why they come here? Five words: Free market's rule of law. Those things create prosperity, which creates jobs people want. Forty dollars for a full day's work isn't prosperity. It's exploitation and you wouldn't do it. - Excuse me. - Can I help you? Yeah. We're looking for a worker named Eduardo? Throw a rock, you're bound to hit one. Have you seen this guy? - Yeah. Jose. - Manuel. Yeah. He showed up a few days ago, worked for one day, got paid... ...never saw him again. What did he do? Have any idea what happened after he left? Don't know, don't care. Mind if we ask around for Eduardo? - Ask away. - Thanks. Eduardo? - Eduardo? - Eduardo? Eduardo?! It's not me. I think he's working down over there. Hey! Stop! I said, stop! Hold it right there! - Hey, hey, hey! - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, San Salvador is that way! These the triggermen at the Chez Club? Some of them, I think. Happened fast. Rondell Robinson. You saw him firing the gun in the club? Yeah. - Beautiful. - You know who he is? Yes, I do. Let's make this short and sweet. Wherever you think I was, I wasn't. - Whatever you think I did, I didn't. - That's your story? - Cover to cover. - I wouldn't plan on selling movie rights. Guess I'll just have to settle for starring in it. You're a murder suspect, Rondell. I've got a witness saw you pull the trigger at the Chez Club. Yeah, right. What witness? A cop. And a jury's gonna love her. - I got a phone call coming, right? - You've only got one thing left to deal. - That's who's giving you protection. - I don't need no protection. Even if we can't tie you to one of the dead bodies... ...discharging a firearm in a crowded club... Bye-bye, Rondell. So about that phone call. If you think that you can sell drugs... ...and commit murder in my district because a cop's protecting you... ...you're dead wrong! - I thought I told you to lay low. - I was listening to Miles Davis... ...when this captain shows up. - He get anything? No. I always keep my crib clean. But he's got a serious bug up his ass about some cop protecting me. Just keep your mouth shut. I'll handle Aceveda. We have indications Manuel's disappearance may involve foul play. - Really? You don't know for sure? - We have a suspect. He won't be able to elude us for long. Once we capture him, we'll know more. Thank you for making this a priority. You keep me apprised? Of any developments. Is there something else? At the risk of having an ulterior motive myself... Yes. I know police officers aren't accorded the same respect in this community... ...as they were a decade ago. - An unfortunate development. However, Latinos are a plurality in Los Angeles... ...and in this district. There is going to be a seat opening up on the City Council next year. It's traditionally been filled with a black candidate. I think it's our time. I agree. With your backing... ...I could win that seat. I could be of great use to you. I like you, David, quite a bit... ...but I don't think I can sell a cop to these voters. Not here, not now. Who knows? Maybe in time, things will become much different. Until then, I'm sorry. What would you think of a man who exposed corruption? Brought down dirty cops from inside the department? I'd think he was committing professional suicide. But couldn't you sell him to the voters? Absolutely. - We got a call about a kidnapping. - They took my boy, Thurman. - When did you find out? - Today. I got a ransom call asking for $ 1 0,000. I don't have it! - When did you last see Thurman? - Three weeks. - How long has he been missing? - Since last night. - The last time you spoke? - A month ago. Then how do you know he's only been missing since last night? Cemetery called. Somebody dug up his body. - Thurman's dead? - Going on three weeks. - Code four, cancel that backup, please. - Roger that. Ten-four. Ma'am, if the kidnapper calls back, call us. You're not gonna help me? To be honest, they'll push it to the bottom. Detectives, they have more important things to do. But it's a crime, isn't it? Digging up my son, holding it for ransom? - Yes, ma'am. - So you two will help me, then, right? Julien, you stay with her. I'll ride solo. - Ma'am. - Good. Hey. - I got a little problem. - What's that? The guy you ID'd today, he's a C.I. Of mine. - Really? - Yeah. He's the guy who gave me the shooters. He was firing in self-defense. None of his shots killed anybody. I was hoping maybe your memory could get a little fuzzy on this one. I don't know, Vic. Aceveda's all over this one. But if it ever goes to trial? I don't know. Let me think about it. That's all I ask. - That's Thurman right there. - I went to high school with him. Did you know him? He and his friends used to beat me up. It's okay. He made me a better student. I hid out in the library until I grew 9 inches my junior year. He was killed robbing a liquor store. Thurman? He was a thief. He did drugs. I was afraid to tell you. I would've helped you anyway. I mean, maybe he didn't find his path here on earth... ...but he's with Jesus now. - You believe that? I know that. - Hello? - You got the money ready? Yes. Where's my son's body? Bring the money to the cemetery at 1 0. - What? - Bring the money to the cemetery... ... at 1 0:00 sharp. - I can't understand you. - Bring the money to the cemetery... ... at 1 0:00 sharp or Thurman's body will be chopped to pieces... - ... and you'll never see him again. - Henry! Is that you? Face front. - Did you hate her that much? - No. She's all right. We dated for a while, you know? - Then why did you do it? - Why did I do it? Why did I do it? Knew she had life insurance on her boy. I wanted to take my new lady on one of them cruises. Dottie spent all the insurance money on Thurman's funeral. Can you make it Thursday? How many problems can a 5-year-old have? Enough that he's got an appointment with a developmental pediatrician. - Matthew thinks he's a dog now. - A German shepherd. So what? You're not here. You don't see everything. - See what? - The problems. Why do you have to fight me on this? I'm not. Okay, I'll try. I'll try, okay? I'm really losing it. Why don't you go take a bath? I'll put the kids to bed. Okay. Good night. Thanks. - Get down. - Hey. I'm a cop. Get down. Don't scream. I said, I'm a cop! And I'm a cop killer. But not tonight. Tonight's to show you how we're gonna do it. What do you want? Forget what you saw at the Chez Club. Understand? Yeah. I understand. Come on. - Hey, hey, hey! - You piece of shit! - Something wrong, officer? - You think you can get to me? Girl, you better take some kind of pill. Damn. You listen to me. I'm a cop. You don't scare me. I don't know what you're talking about. You do look scared, though. Hey. - I'll catch you outside, okay? - Meet you out there. What was all that between you and my C. I? Did you tell him I was the one that ID'd him? Of course not. What the hell is going on? He sent guys after me. They put a gun to my head... ...and told me to forget what I saw at the Chez Club. - You should take the day off. - No, maybe I should go after them. - Let me take care of this. - Know what, I can take care of myself. - You went after a cop? - Vic, I just scared her, man. Cops are off-limits. Shooting at somebody shooting at me. I was taking care of it. I didn't know. I had to do something, man. Take your drug money and bail yourself out. And then what? In the year and a half it'll take to go to trial, I'll make it go away. Look, I can't take no chances, Vic. The biggest chance you could've taken was to piss me off. And that's exactly what you did. - You see him? - No. But I got you a Spanish-English phrase book. My gift to you. Third day in a row you're checking the Real Estate section. - What's the deal? - None your. What's that, Spanish? English for "none of your business." We're partners. Share. Wanna share? Here's the Sports page. I'll find out. I'm a detective. There he is. Bingo, gringo. Eduardo Salcido? You and Manuel hopped on the same truck. You went to work together? - Did you kill him after work ended? - No. - So you killed him on the way to work? - No. Where is he? How come his wife hasn't heard from him? Spare me the "Yo no s?s." We know. - Know? - About the grudge. You hated Manuel. You told people you wanted to kill him. He my friend. - Used to be. Till the trip. - What happened on that truck? What truck? The one that snuck you and Manuel across the border. - What made you wanna kill him? - Nothing. - You fight? He steal? What? - Nothing. He did something. - Nothing happened. - Was it personal? Did he hurt you? I'm not the one who killed Manuel. So Manuel is dead. Stay here, Eduardo. - You ask me, he was raped. - What? I know I sound like Dutch with one of his theories. But my first few years on the job... ...I practically lived in hospitals, taking statements from rape victims. - He's got that look. - The look? Nervousness, isolation. But it's mostly in the eyes. Raped in a truck sneaking into the country? How is that possible? It's possible. What do you mean, sounds like one of my theories? What's with the getups? Avoiding cameras. - So, what's the problem? - This is the goddamn problem. - He poisoned my baby. - Threw some meat over the fence... ...next thing, he's choking to death. - T-Bonz? - Of course, it's T-Bonz. - He's got to pay. - She supposed to be in the studio... ...finishing her album right now. - How can I work after this? Look. It's game-over time for T-Bonz. Be a man. I know. You know how much this setback is costing me? - Get that off my table. - The goddamn bastard has to pay. - That's T-Bonz breaking his truce. - You gonna be a man... ...or do I have to find someone to do the job? Look. I told you, this is why we here. I know what I got to do, all right? All right? - I just need you to help me do it. - Do what? Do the deed. T-Bonz. I know where he's holed up at. But I can't get to him. - A man with a badge could, though. - Why would I do something like that? Money. I'll make that rent Rondell paying you look like chump change. Pay you double if I get to watch. You want this war to end, right? Then help me end it, or more blood is gonna get spilled. Give me the address. - Was Manuel the one who raped you? - No rape. - He hold you down? - It not happen. - Catch you sleeping, you wake up... - No. Somebody did that to me, I'd smash their head in. I'd stab them, shoot them, push him off a roof. - He raped you in that truck, didn't he? - We'd understand if you killed him. I murder Manuel. You killed Manuel? I murder Manuel. Good. Where? Working con el Se?or Jamison. - We were on the roof and he fall. - You pushed him? No. He... We were carrying... Air-conditioning unit. "Look out, Manuel," but he didn't hear him. He slipped and he fell. - He slipped and he fell. - I murder him. That's not murder, Eduardo. That's not what Mr. Jamison say. What else did Se?or Jamison say? This is private property! This is private property. - It was an accident. - A man was accidentally buried here? I asked about Manuel's wife... ...his family, and no one seemed to know. - He had no papers, he was illegal. - Burying a man on your site is illegal. - I wanted to alert the authorities. - Too much of a hassle? It would have shut down business for weeks, put these guys out of work. - What would they have done then? - Please. You told Eduardo he was guilty of murder. This is what you call planting rice and beans. Told you not to talk, asshole! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have... This ain't no police station. What's going on? Man, please, dog. Whatever you thinking about doing, don't do it. T, what happened to that trash talker I fell in love with? Come on, man, I'm begging you. Come on, man. Come on, you dog killer, let's go. - Come on, man. - You broke the truce. Time to pay. I'll give you money, dude. I'll hook you up, Mackey. I got money. I just need one phone call. I'll give you whatever you need. - Let's end this, dude. It's over. - Why you crying, T-Bonz? - What's he doing here? - I paid for front-row seats. Mackey, man, please, dog. Please. - Come on, Mackey, man. - Get in. - You too, Kern. - What? - The two of you guys are shacking up. - Are you crazy? - He's definitely crazy. - You two are so keen... ...on killing each other, fine. I'm cutting out the middle man. - We had a deal, Vic. - Hey, I'm never for sale. Now you know. - I can respect that, but I'm saying... - Shut up! Get inside! You two can't make peace, I'll see one of you in the morning. - This how you gonna do it, man? - Close it. - I should've thought of this yesterday. - Yeah. - Hey, why you got to be such a bitch? - Because of pricks like you, Freddie. - I got rights, you goddamn dyke. - Hey. Save it for your new roommate. - Yeah, I got a VIN number for you. - Rondell Robinson just made bail. - Yeah? Well, that's his right. - Hundred grand in cash. Lot of money for a kid from the ghetto. Maybe he's got a rich uncle. - You all right? - I'm fine. - You just been a little jacked up today. - Well, I'm fine. If you don't wanna talk about it, that's cool. But I'm gonna say a prayer for you tonight, though. Thanks. Heard you made bail. Hey. Your peaches are about to go bad in there. Where's my stuff? Where's my TV, man? Donated to the Lynwild Boys' Club. You should've seen the looks on these kids' faces. Man, it was like Christmas. My goddamn records, man?! You went after a cop, Rondell. You should thank me, dude. I talked him out of doing a hell of a lot worse. The district attorney is content that Manuel's death was accidental. I see. This Mr. Jamison, what is his punishment? He'll plead guilty to tampering with evidence, be fined and released. Se?ora Ruiz, I am truly sorry about your husband. This man, Jamison, worked for a large company, no? Yes. Then I can sue them for much money? Thanks again, David. I'm glad I could help. I have given some thought to your proposal. - And? - I'm intrigued. I have a few months before I decide who I'm going to back. Show me what you can do. - They no think I murder Manuel? - No. Muchas gracias, Detective Dutch. Tell me something. You hated Manuel. You made threats against his life. Why go on the same job with him that day? When the truck come, they pick Manuel, they pick me. I have to work. So, what's next, Eduardo? I don't know.
