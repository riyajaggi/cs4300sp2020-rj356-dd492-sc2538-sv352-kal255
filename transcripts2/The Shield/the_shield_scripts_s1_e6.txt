 - Where is it? - Don't know what you're talking about. Hey, treat yourself to a full cavity search if you like. - You took my Ding Dongs, didn't you? - Right. Stay away from me and stay away from my desk. Oh, you've gotta be shitting me. Christ. How old is this one, 1 3? Oh, man. Hooker? Facedown like the other four? Looks that way. I warned you about this guy. Yes, you did. Couple saw a green car cruising back and forth about an hour ago. - They get a make? - Just said it was green. - What about the driver? - Too dark.

 - Taillight was busted. - Right or left? - They didn't say. - Go back. Grill them. Every detail. This happened on our turf. You give me the resources, I'll get this guy. What resources? Everybody you can spare for as long as you can. - Personnel's stretched thin as it is. - I need 48 hours. - I can't do it. - A predator was standing right here... ...less than two hours ago. How committed are we to catching him? For the next 2 4 hours, she's your one and only case. Medical examiner's initial report tells us the victim is 1 2 to 1 4 years of age. A 1 2- to 1 4-year-old hooker. Frank, you and your boys... ...round up every pimp and pro you can find. Bring them here. Neighbors saw a green car pass the park before the body was found. The right rear taillight was broken. Check every gas station, car wash, valet guy in the neighborhood. June, put together a reward flier: Photo of the girl... ...mention the broken light on the car. - Got it. She had some keys. Vic, your guys find a locksmith and track the numbers. - Excuse me? - Sit down with a locksmith. You want me, I'll be out on the street finding the prick who did this. Either we get our unsub in the next 2 4 hours... ...or we probably don't get another chance until he kills again. Let's go. Vic! Yes, Herr Wagenbach? You got a problem with me running the show, take the night off. - I thought you wanted this case solved. - I do. You just wanna be the one who solves it. And when I do, I don't want it thrown out of court because of your tactics. Get something straight. Somebody kills a girl in my back yard, I get involved. - I'll crack this case with or without you. - It'll have to be with. I run this investigation. You find something, you report it immediately. I bring the guy in, you'll be the first to know, Dutchboy. People see me as a joke around here. They don't know the real me. - I'm not sure the squad's ready for that. - I'm not a joke. - I know that. - Well, now they'll know it too. I'm gonna get this guy. It's a little early to be making promises, isn't it? One thing they respect is success. Well, I guess we better nail this guy, then. What do we got? Body found at midnight... ...green car seen in the park at 1 1. Victim has no identification. Prostitute. Age 1 2 to 1 4. Had a sweet tooth. Birth control pills. Don't make 1 2-year-olds like they used to. I was wondering what was going on with the Strike Team thing. The apartment turned up empty for cocaine. We have no proof of his guilt. Doesn't mean they didn't steal those drugs. I know. But without hard evidence... I saw them pocket it. Get the car thief to testify she found it in the truck. - It's not that easy. - Why not? I won't put you in a position to carry that weight. Thought you wanted Mackey off the streets. More than you know. Which is also why I won't let you do it. - Captain, I don't understand. - Exactly. You don't understand. So take my advice and let this go. - Captain, I saw them pocket two... - Julien. Let this go. How you doing? Been working my ass off. Might be time to take a vacation. Can't afford to. Had to drop my price. - Why? - Would you pay top dollar for this? Guess it could be worse. Found her a few hours ago. Know who she is? - She works kitty-corner from Tracy. - Where? Across from the burrito joint, next to that place. Know who pimps her out? No. But Tracy would. Thanks. This guy has a thing for working girls. - Make sure someone's watching you. - I thought that's what you did. I don't wanna see you get hurt again. I won't let it happen twice. Does anyone know who this girl is? Look at it. Who knows her? Hey, that's Sally. Sally who? Sally Struthers? - All in the Family. - I know who Sally Struthers is. Maybe she saw one of those "save the kids" ads. Whatever, that's the name she went by. Good news is, our timeline's starting to come into focus. Her friend said Sally usually started her shift around 1 0... ...but didn't show last night. Another one said she saw her going into a drugstore on Vermont at 7 p.m. You're a young girl on a Friday night, what would you do between 7 and 1 0? Shop, eat, see a movie. Jim Wright, FBI. Someone called the Bureau asking for assistance? I did. Dutch Wagenbach. You got here fast. - This is my partner, Claudette Wyms. - Good to meet you. So... ...we've got an unsub killing hookers, huh? - Been there, done that. - This girl was only 1 2, 1 3. You did the right thing calling us. Most cops are afraid we're gonna come in... ...step all over their toes. - Not me. I can't wait to pick your brain. Well, let me be clear. This is your case. I'm just here to help. Hey! What are you boys chewing? A little grilled Snoopy, side of Woodstock? We're clean. - Think about trying a rib eye? - What do you want? - You remember your friend Sally? - Nope. Really. Never pimped her out? - Nope. - You know absolutely nothing? - Less than nothing. - Really? So that apartment on Western, where you keep all that fenced electronics... ...you don't remember that either? - Wanna make Robbery Division's day? - Oh, yeah. Sounds sweet. Very sweet. I'll call in the warrant. Hey, lady, where's the phone? - It's over there. - Yeah, okay. - You were pimping her out? - She came to us. We did her a favor. - So you never took a cut? - Twenty percent. Plus a few free pokes a week. Wipe those smiles off your faces, shitheads. You don't score points with me banging 1 2-year-olds. What kind of work she do before tricking for you? I heard she worked this sex club. - She was a kid. - So? So, what kind of work could she do for a sex club? - You'll have to ask them. - Oh, don't worry. I will. I'm impressed you were able to pick up on this guy. I've done a lot of research on criminology, Behavioral Science Unit. Shows. Hey, Dutch. I got a gas station attendant here who says he might've seen your green car. Detective, I got a guy saw our flier. Said he sold drugs to the victim earlier. Gotta love it when a case gets warm. So I'm working and I see a suspicious white guy... Suspicious how? Well, he was white. I go out to look at him and he turned away, didn't want me to see his face. - Tell me about the car. - It was green. Two-door? Four-door? Ford? Chevy? You do work in a gas station, right? I just run the register. You sell Sally drugs tonight? - She had a thing for ecstasy. - You're admitting to a crime? I'm a minor. My lawyer can argue it was for personal use. Was Sally for personal use too? - She was a customer. - Did you know she was a prostitute? How do you think she paid me? - I gave her five hits around 8:30. - Five. She always buy that much? Said it got her through the night. So... ...how much is this reward? - Reward? "For useful information." You know, like the flier said. That's why I'm here. So, what's my reward? Dealing drugs to a minor, statutory rape. - How does six months to a year sound? - What? - Get a license plate number? - Better. I got evidence. - Did he pay with a credit card? - No, man, cash. The dude paid with a 20 at the teller, and he only pumped 1 7. He never came back for his change. Who doesn't want $3 change back? - So you kept the 20? - No. That was part of the deposit at the end of my shift. I saved his change. - You saved $3 in change? - Yeah, dust them for fingerprints. - But he never touched them. - No, but it's his $3. It's gotta help somehow, right? - Captain, we've got a problem. - What is it? The toilets in the women's bathroom aren't working. - What do you mean, not working? - They're clogged. Don't look at me. - So now we have no working toilets? - Right. - Did you call Maintenance? - They can't come till tomorrow. - Call a plumber, then. - Who will pay? Use my credit card. Just get someone down here. Hey, buddy. Imagine meeting you here. - Excuse me? - You remember me. Vic. - Your best friend from Boston. - Never been to Boston. - Come on! - Hey! Come on. Ted, you remember. We went to high school together. - Give me my wallet. I don't know you! - Oh, right. Now you're gonna tell me you weren't about to go into that sex club. - Sex club? That's a sex club? - Yeah, Ted. Members only. And tonight I'm your guest. Thanks for taking me on such short notice. Ted is one of our best clients. We like to keep him happy. Sounds like you do a great job of that. Will you be watching or taking part tonight, Vic? Watching. I like to test the waters before I jump in. You'll be watching Sun-Lee tonight. - Excellent. - We have tapes if you're interested. I'm sure I will be. I won't pull any punches. She's critical. She? You mean the pipes? You eat well? Get a physical once a year? - Flush out your pipes regularly? - I see where you're going. Right. Maintaining a sewage system is no different. - Can you get them working or not? - I'll see what I can do. Why have you been making noises about contacting IAD? - Who told you that? - You think word wouldn't get out? - It was just a question. - Why do you wanna talk to IAD? Because I saw something. - Saw what? - You don't wanna know. Forget about the what, then. Hey, who are you talking about? I'm not talking about anyone. The more I say, the less people wanna listen. People around here prefer just to cover things up and hope I'll just shut up. Hey, what about my wallet? I ever see you near here again, your wife's getting a very unpleasant call. Screw. - Hello. - Billy. It's Vic. Sorry to call you so late. I got probable cause for a no-knock warrant. - What was that all about? - I saw what I saw. I can't let it lie. Goddamn it, you don't know what you're doing here. - I know right from wrong, captain. - I told you to let this go. I may answer to you, but I also answer to God. I won't be at peace with him... ...or myself if I turn my back on this. - You wanna do this? You really wanna do this? Because here's what's gonna happen: Most cops here will treat you like a traitor. You'll take more shit than you've ever taken before. You're gonna be testifying against Vic Mackey. And trust me, he doesn't care if God is on your side. Are you ready for that kind of heat? I'll have to be. Warrant! Police! Get against the wall! Hands up! Get against the wall! Get on your knees right now! Get down! On your knees! Get in a line! Come on, girls, what's wrong with you? Where are the tapes? "Cherrypopper Films." You really take the cake, don't you, lady? Come on, back off! Ready? Let's go! Come on, now. Vic! Vic. - What do you wanna do with the girl? - Keep her in the Clubhouse for now. - Where the hell's Shockley and Peters? - Robbery-homicide call. What? They're supposed to be going over witness statements. It's a robbery-homicide, Dutch. It's only two men. Oh, for God's sake. Quick, get that box. - Oh, jeez. Get my files and Rolodex! - Put what you can on top of your desks. - Come on, get me that other file. - Which one? This one? We got a big problem with these pipes. Just what I need. Goddamn flood in my workspace. - I did up a quickie profile on our killer. - What do you got? Our unsub's late 20s, early 30s. Sporadic employment. Feels unappreciated, worthless. Why does he pose them facedown? Symbolizes the domination he yearns for. He's probably impotent, though, at least with a live girl. Dutch, we got a hit off the flier. Tipster says he saw a guy with Sally in a green vehicle. - We get the caller's address? - Right here. Yes. You better get out there and clean it anyway. Well, I got another couple of buckets. These are closed off over here. Tom Ross. The flier said it was confidential. How did you get my address? Tip line's routed through 91 1. If this guy's a killer, I don't want him coming after me. Your name doesn't leave this room, Tom. Just tell us what you saw. Okay. Basically, I was out last night... ...driving, and I was stopped at a light behind this green car. There was a guy driving, and it seemed he was having a struggle... ...with a girl in the passenger seat. - The girl from the flier? I think so. I was behind them, but it looked weird, so I wrote the license plate down. Did you see if one of his taillights was broken? I think so. Yeah. Run this plate. Cross-reference it, get me a DMV photo. - Computers are down. - What? - They were unplugged due to flooding. - Goddamn it. Then call Central. Have them run it. Fax over a photo. The fax machine's unplugged too. Then send someone over to Central to pick up the photo. - Who should I send? - Just take care of this one thing for me. Each of my workers had documentation saying they were 1 8. - From what? A cereal box? - I said, I want to see my lawyer. - What do you got here? - Busted an underage sex shop. - Looks like a cherrypopper ring too. - Cherrypopper? Preteen girls losing their virginity. The filmmaker's next on my list. - What's the connection to our hooker? - She worked there a few months ago. How does that help me find out what happened last night? - It doesn't. - So you've been doing your own thing. Hey, don't chew up my ass just because your case is coming up short. You couldn't help me by simply tracking down the victim's keys? I was putting a teenage sex show out of business. And I'm trying to catch a killer, asshole. Jesus Christ. We gotta watch these, find out who's behind them. - You gotta be kidding me. - I know. I can't stomach this shit. Yell if you find anything. Hi, Steve. I'm Detective Wagenbach. What's going on? Why am I down here? Your name came up in an investigation of ours. Investigation? Of what? - Drive a '9 7 green Saturn, Steve? - Yeah. Is that a good car? - I guess, yeah. - Reliable? No problems with it? - I had some work done on the brakes. - What about the taillights? - Taillights? - Any broken taillights on your car? No. You sure? I don't think so. Because we checked your car out, Steve. You checked out my car? Why? You got a broken right taillight. Okay. Hey. What happen me now? Well... You get to play blackjack with Vic. Not in trouble? Only if you take me for all my money. Who made you work for Mrs. Park? Mrs. Park help me. She pay ticket. Ten thousand dollar. She's not helping you. She help me star in more movies. Nineteen. You understand that what you did... ...that's not a real movie. It start, though. Fifteen. Vic is forced to hit. Ten. That's a bust. You win. Sun-Lee win? Yeah. You popular in high school, Steve? I had friends. It's not really the same thing, is it? You can always find another dork to eat lunch with. Doesn't make you popular. Guess not. The reason I'm curious about your high school years, Steve, is... ...you've got a sealed juvie record. You're not supposed to know about that. We know about it. We just don't know exactly what your crime was. How about cluing me in? - No. - A little embarrassing, is it? Hey, either tell me what I'm doing here or I'm leaving. - I don't have to tell you anything. - Fine. I'm going, then. You're not going anywhere. Oh, hey, sunshine. How you doing? This bathroom thing's a real nightmare. Don't worry about it. High tide's not for a few more hours. Listen, Vic. There's something you should... - Forget it. - No, no, no. Too late. - Come on. - I really shouldn't. - Oh, you're breaking my heart. - I can get fired for telling you. What if we keep it between us, sunshine? David just had me put a call in to IAD. IAD? Goddamn it. I can't believe he'd do this to you. It's not me I'm worried about. I didn't do anything. I know your guy's already not fitting in. He makes a mistake like this... As his training officer, I just don't want any of that mud sticking to you. - I'll talk to him. - Don't be too hard. He's a good kid. He means well. He's just confused. I can't talk about it. - You're going to IAD about Vic? - It's really none of your business. - You're my partner. It's my business. - Can we just let this rest? Look, Vic is a great cop. You don't testify against a fellow officer until you look him in the eye... ...and hear their side of the story. - I don't know what your deal is... ...but it can't change what happened. - You're wrong. Let Vic explain... You can't explain stealing evidence. That's right, Danny. He stole two bricks of cocaine, and I saw him. Whether you realize it or not, you helped him cover it up. Now stop asking me about this. File says you haven't held a steady job in more than three months, Steve. - Economy stinks. - You must be angry. Nobody likes to feel unappreciated. - Worthless. - I don't feel that way. No, you're a powerful guy. Where were you last night around 1 1? - At home, in bed. - Anyone to corroborate that? That I was in bed? - I wish. - Wish what? For a girl in your bed? - That you could actually get it up? - What are you talking about? What's so private about this sealed record of yours? - It's sealed. - What are you hiding? You a peeping Tom? Stalker? Like to kill cats? What? I broke into my high school. - I trashed the place. - Sure. I can see that. You like to destroy things, don't you, Steve? Hey, Dutch! We just found Sally in one of these cherrypopper tapes. Come on. While your lawyer's on the way... ...we're gonna have a little screening party. We'll watch that tape until one of two things happens: Either you're gonna tell me everything you know about Sally... ...or I'm gonna have to turn it off. But if I have to turn that tape off... ...there are no more rules in this room. Right there. Yeah. Turn it off. I got her from Kurt Schmidt. He makes the movies. And how do I find Kurt? You okay? That was Sally. She's a kid. She was. - The asshole who made her do that... - Don't worry. He's mine. Good. Ramirez just called in. 1 4-year-old kid saw the flier. Says he's Sally's boyfriend. - Why would someone do that to her? - That's what we're trying to find out. You were Sally's boyfriend? - Yeah. - When was the last time you saw her? Last night. We met at this ice-cream place. What time was that? - She left right before 1 0. - Are you sure? Yeah. That's when her curfew is. She has to be home by 1 0. - Where did she live? - I never saw her house. She said her parents were traditional, didn't let her have boys over. And she was your girlfriend for how long? A few months. But it only started getting serious last week. Serious? Well, that's when she finally kissed me. She was young. She wanted to take it slow. Did you have any idea what Sally did for a living? She was a freshman, right? Hi, Vic. Play cards? Later. Right now I need you to show me the guy who made your movie. How come? To help me with my case. I helped you out, right? You think you could help me out too? - Yes. - Good. - Vic mad at Sun-Lee? - Oh, no. Not at you. You should be with your family, being a kid. Which one is he? Him. That man put me in movie. I can't talk about it. Look, I just haven't been a good listener or a good training officer. I was scared to believe you. - Believe him, then. - No. I wanna believe the truth. If you just tell me what the truth is, I promise I'll listen. So she's at the ice-cream store here at 9:45. She heads to work at 1 0. Fastest way to her corner's here. Which means she was picked up on Cassandra Street. - Yeah. - Forget a full confession. All you have to do is get him to admit he was on Cassandra at 1 0:00. You get him to say that... ...with all the circumstantial evidence, you got him. I'll get him to say it. Ding Dong? No, thanks. I think we're almost done here, Steve. Hey! - Kurt Schmidt? - Yeah. - You're under arrest. - For what, man? Making movies. - Get off me, man. I'm an editor. - Cherrypopper movies, you sick prick. You can't prove that. I got tapes and witnesses, asshole. Only question left is whether you... ...took a header into the concrete trying to resist arrest. - You got a girlfriend, Steve? - No. I remember my 20s. Rough times. Too old for the college girls, too young for the mature ones. - What do you mean? - Not being able to get a date. Get laid. Pisses you off. Aren't I, like, entitled to a lawyer or something? Entitled? You, entitled? What about Kitty Weir or Rosita Pedraza? What about Mary Esposito? What about Sheryl Watkins? What about Sally, Steve? What were they entitled to? - I don't wanna look at those. - You don't like your work? Is that why they're facedown? So you don't have to look after you kill them? - You think I killed those girls? - I know you killed them, Steve. No way! Fine. Fine. You didn't kill them. But at least don't lie to me about where you were last night. I'm not. We have a witness... ...who saw you in your green car on Cassandra Street... ...with the broken taillight at 1 0:00. So don't lie to me. At least tell me the truth about this one thing. Witness? You're not talking about Tom, are you? - Tom? - Yeah. Tom Ross. Is he the one who says he saw me? Oh, Jesus, it's Tom, isn't it? - This one just raised the bar. - Raised the bar? For practical jokes. It's a prank, man. We always try to one-up each other and he probably heard about the girls and... Dude, man, you scared the shit out of me with that! - A prank? - Oh, shit. Is Tom here right now? Please tell me he's here. He's here. Great. Dude, you gotta do me a favor. You gotta help me get him back. When you see him, you gotta act like you're super pissed and tell him... ...tell him he's under arrest for something like... - Obstruction of justice? - Perfect. - It was just a joke. - And the taillight? I saw it on the flier, so I busted his. - You realize what you did? - Have a sense of humor. A girl's killer's still out there because you're a goddamn clown. Hey, hey. Easy. Easy. The guy who murdered Sally's still out there, and I'm here... ...with my dick in my hand because this guy thought it'd be funny... ...to rake his buddy over the coals. - All right. Screw him. - You still got time. - I just wasted seven hours. Gone. I'm sorry. I gotta take this. Hey, Dutch. You got a job to do. Do it. Connie? Jesus Christ. What happened? He's the killer maybe, right? He's an insurance salesman from Fresno. What did you do here? - He was acting strange. - So you shot him? - I didn't want him to hurt me. - How much have you been smoking? You gotta help me, Vic. Christ, Connie! - Can't you say you shot him? - At least 1 0 cops can place me... ...at the Barn when this went down. - I thought that he was gonna kill me! Well, that story's not gonna cut it. I'll lose my son. Vic, please! Think of something! What is it? No. Clean yourself up. I gotta call this in. You thought of something, Vic. I know you did. - I'm sorry, Connie, my hands are tied. - All I have is Brian. Don't let me lose him. You'll need a better story. Okay. All right. You had sex. You asked him to pay. He said he didn't have to pay, that he was gonna make you pay. He started hitting you. He took out his gun. You fought him off, you took it and shot him. Do you have that? I asked him to pay. He said he didn't have to and he hit me. That's good. Your friends, they'll believe that? Only if you have the bruises to prove it. Okay. - I can't, Connie. - It's okay, Vic. Come on! - No. - Do it! - No. - Hit me! - Hit me! - No! - Hit me! - No! - Come on, Vic, hit me. - No. Please. Vic, please. Please. Hit me. So where does that leave us? We know she disappeared on Cassandra Street. So far, no witnesses. - Anything from the park? - I did a full sweep. Nothing. - Well, maybe Forensics will... - No. This guy didn't leave any forensics on the first victims. He's only gonna get better, not sloppier. - In that case, I'm calling the units off. - What? A brawl broke out at Council Rock High, 60 students from rival schools. - I need everyone I can get over there. - You promised me 2 4 hours. I'm sorry, Dutch. I just don't have the bodies. So a dead hooker gets 2 1 hours? What would she get if she was the mayor's daughter? Claudette is gonna go back into rotation. Now, you show me some new evidence, clues, a viable lead, and then we'll talk. You'll assign the same amount of men to find a killer as to fixing our pipes? - Getting mad doesn't change anything. - She deserves better. I know. You did all you could. It's not over. I need an aspirin. Dutch, you're soaking yourself. You okay? - Sure. - You think we can find time to study? - What? - For the sergeant's exam. I feel like I'm, you know, kind of falling behind. Sure. Why don't we do that right now? I'll just drop my serial-killer thing to help you study. Because what you want always comes first, right? Comes before me. Comes before everybody else here. Even comes before a dead girl... ...we're all supposed to just forget about come tomorrow. So grab your books. Let's find a nice, quiet spot. We'll study for that test right now. We had sex. And then I asked... Told him to pay. He said he didn't have to. That's when he started hitting me. You did good. - I'm scared. - You're halfway home. Just tell the detectives the same thing. I'm gonna change, Vic. I'm gonna clean up. And be a mother to Brian. It's gonna be okay. Get clean... ...change... ...be a good mother. I'm gonna do it. Sun-Lee. I go now? I called INS. I'm sending you back to Korea. - But you say you help Sun-Lee. - I am. This is the best thing for you. - You don't know what like there. - I know what it's like here. - Parents never take me back! - Lf they won't, the authorities will. You'll be sent to a foster home, to school. Someone will look after you. - Sun-Lee come back. I will. - Maybe. And even if it only buys you six months, I can live with that. I'm sorry. Watch your step here. Wait. Wait! Sorry. She looked like Sally. Almost was Sally. Hey, Dutch. - You showed me something today. - What do you mean? I failed. No, no. No, you didn't. We took down some bad guys doing some bad stuff. - You did that, not me. - Hey, we both did it. We'll get your guy too. Just won't be today. No, it won't. Serial cases are marathons, not sprints. I remember working the Green River Case in 1 984. Forty-nine bodies. Had 50 times your resources. 1 984. We made our first arrest last year. Doesn't hurt if you don't let it. Place should be clear by morning. Here's your bill. - Eight hundred dollars? - Yeah. Cash only. I don't take credit. - I'll have to go to an ATM. - I'll be here all night. Hey. What's up? Did you steal drugs from those Armenians? - Oh, not you too. - Hey, look, Vic. I owe you too much to ever repeat your answer to anyone, but if... If I helped you get away with it, I gotta know the truth. Did you steal drugs? You're asking this after what happened the other night?
