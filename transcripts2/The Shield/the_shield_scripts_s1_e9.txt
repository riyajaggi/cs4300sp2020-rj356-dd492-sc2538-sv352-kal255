 Previously on The Shield: That's my book. Matthew has autism. Oh, Jesus. This is a brotherhood. Everybody knows that but you. You gotta decide if you wanna stay partners. If you do, open up. If you don't, talk to Aceveda. He already turned me down when I asked for a new partner. Maybe he'll listen to you. My husband was murdered. This one's been hanging on the vine for a year, man. She is ripe. Handing in this arrest report's the only way to stop you from making a mistake.

 - That report doesn't prove anything. - I don't have to prove you're gay. In this house, all I gotta do is say it, with all the gory details. - I'm not sure they stole any drugs. - What? It was dark. They were at the other end. My view was obstructed. - Mackey got to you. - No. - He threatened you. - He didn't. Might not feel like it, but you did the right thing yesterday. You were there for me. I'm there for you. Come on, homes. What's up? Get up, guero! I said, stay down! I said, shut up! - Stop! - Shut up!

 - Please! - Shut up! Don't look so bad to me, huh? You gonna follow us, bitch? - You gonna follow us? - No. I didn't think so, ése. See you later, homes. Don't be a loser there, homes. Have a puff on me, homes. So how many were there? Three. They wore bandannas and masks. - I can tell they were beaners. - How? By the way they talked, Spanish tattoos. Describe one. I saw a serpent with wings and the other one was just L-M. It's Los Mags. We better call Vic. - Matthew, what's this? - A girl. How does she feel? Can't you tell? Hungry? Maybe Daddy can help. Daddy's hungry too. Maybe she's hungry. What else is she? - Happy? - Yes. She's happy. And this girl? How does she feel? Happy. It's work. Today's your day off. Hey. Yeah. All right, I'll come in. There's been another truck jacking. I need a break. I'm sick. I haven't slept more than two hours all week long. - I know. - Shane gets three days off... ...to go play in Vegas. - Shane's not in charge. I am. The new babysitter starts tomorrow. Things'll get a lot easier for you then. When will you be home? As soon as I can. Cesar, tear yourself away, will you? - One sec. - Yeah. Newlyweds, giving each other matching genital rings as wedding gifts. - It's a beautiful thing. - I'll take your word for it. Check this out. Any idea who that tattoo belongs to? Not my work. Lacks the detail. Belongs to a Los Mag. Gotta be a local. I'll make a couple of calls, see what I can dig up for you. Oh, cholo rising. Latino, 20s. - And there's the girlfriend. - Thank you, Cesar. - Hector Estanza. Let's rock. - Let's do it. I told you not to mess with... What am I gonna do? He was banging on the door. I don't give a shit. - Don't be so stupid. - Leave me alone. Get out. This guy likes to hurt people, so be ready. - Stupid ass. - Go! - Freeze! Police! - What are you doing? On the floor! On the floor, now! Stop! Freeze! Freeze! - Okay, okay! - Lem! Lem! He's got a gun! Oh, my God. Oh, shit! I thought it was a gun. - Check and see if he's got one. - Vic? We got him! Stay inside the house! Nothing, nothing, nothing. Damn! What do we do? - Just when we got clear. - I shot an unarmed guy. All right. He's the jacker. We'll figure out what to say. Right. He threatened us with a carton of cigarettes, so I shot him? Hey, just let me think! Six Paul 1 1, shots fired, 2 728 Verbano Ave. Suspect is down. Requesting backup and an ambulance. - Oh, man, Vic. - I know, I know. I don't like it any more than you do. But we can't afford to take another hit right now. You saw what he did to the trucker. - Yeah. I know. I know. - All right. Come on. Vic? Wanna tell me what happened? We got a sketch off the jacking victim. He was a Los Mag banger. ICI turned me on to Hector Estanza. We sit on the girl he lives with... Hector shows up, we go in, Hector runs. The guy turns on me. He had me dead to rights. Lem saved my ass. - As righteous as a shoot gets. - Chaco! Oh, my God! Chaco! What did you do? Chaco. Don't worry. Your boyfriend's gonna make it. Boyfriend? That's my brother, Chaco. You shot the wrong guy? We shot Hector's girlfriend's brother. He had a carton of stolen cancer sticks on him and a gun pointed right at me. - So he's the right guy. - He and Hector are Los Mags. They're probably in the same crew. We'll get Hector. - Is the girl involved? - Not that I know of. Lem's at the hospital getting her statement. Boyfriend beat her up. - Maybe she'll roll on him. - Here's hoping. Officer Lowe. Taking back your IAD statement hurt me. It hurt me bad. It let Mackey off the hook. There's clearly misconduct here. Give me one good reason why I should let you off the hook. All my life I wanted to be a police officer. I grew up in this neighborhood. I wanna make a difference here. You could've made that difference by taking down Vic Mackey. I knew I got in over my head when I first made those charges. I'm worried you've made some pact with Mackey. No, sir. I've got nothing to do with him. I just want a fresh start, to be a good cop. I'll prove it to you. You'll receive an official reprimand. I'll dock a week's pay and put you on probation. I'll decide in a month whether or not to keep you on. Thank you. Captain, a new training officer might help me with that fresh start. You don't get to choose who you partner with. Neither does Officer Sofer. Miss Orozco? Tigre. - I'm Curtis. - What do you want? Can we talk about Los Mags and your brother? My brother jumped Los Mags three years ago. He's out. Well, he didn't look out last night. He was protecting me from the same guy you were looking for, Hector. So Hector beat you up? He didn't like me breaking up with him. Well, you ever think about pressing charges? Yeah, like you guys can protect me. Chaco was taking care of me until your guy shot him... ...and he don't even bang no more. - You're sure? You don't wanna believe me, ask around. We decided we better cut him loose. Coyotes? This time of year, rabbits and squirrels burrow underground. Coyotes get hungry, can't find food, they come down to forage. - Thank you, Ranger Rick. - My grandpa had a farm. Over here. - It's about time. - I'm moving as fast as I can. His name is Maynard Hawkins. Maynard, I'm Detective Wyms. This is Detective Wagenbach. Were you chained up all night? I don't wanna be in no trouble. You're not the one who's in trouble. He's got some pretty serious bites. Where are the paramedics? - I'll go call them this time. - For God's sakes, cut him loose. Leave me alone. I'm fine. He's blind. - Hey, what's going on? - Who're you? I'm Lloyd. That's my dad. Lloyd, your father's been attacked by coyotes. Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. - I can explain. - Save it for the station! Daddy. What are you doing here? - Came to see you. - What's wrong? I just needed a good place to read. Well, I can't talk right now. I've got a case and... Dutch, my father, Bryce. Professor Wyms, glad to finally meet you. It's my pleasure. - Go ahead. I'll wait. - It could be hours. I'm only on page 23, and I imagine this is a fascinating place. - It is. - Actually, it's not. - Why don't you be the judge? - All right. I don't understand why I'm here. - You're in trouble. - For what? Shouldn't you be in there for point-counterpoint? There is no counterpoint. He's guilty. It's down to a matter of degree. - We're charging you for elderly abuse. - What? So it's the subtle fractions of culpability... ...that conspire to determine that man's fate? I like the way you talk. You had your father tied up outside like an animal without proper shelter. - I can explain that. - I'm listening. - I'm divorced. - Surprise me some more. I pay alimony and child support, and I fell behind. State garnishes my wages. And I missed some payments... ...to the nursing home, and they kicked my pop out. Did you try to place him in another home? It cost too much. I'm barely scraping by as is. What about his benefits? After food and 50 bucks a month to keep him in Depends... ...there ain't nothing left. - So you leave him outside, chained up? He's blind. He wanders. - Where's your mother? - Ran off, left me to take care of him. I'm telling you, it is the system that is screwing him over, not me. That's so you don't wander. Hey, Brian, thanks for the drop-by. Travis, what a shock to see you back here again. It's like going to a family reunion. I wanted to ask about one of your parolees. Which one? I've only got about 300. - Well, he's a Los Mag. - That narrows it down to about 30. - His name's Chaco Orozco. - Oh, yeah, Chaco. That was quick. That's because I remember the good ones by name. So he's a good guy? Well, let's put it this way, I wish they could all be like him. He's not in any kind of trouble, is he? - No, I think we made a big mistake. - Why? I talked to his parole officer and his Clean Slate counselor. - Clean Slate? - It's the program for bangers... ...who want out. What'd his counselor say? In three years he's never missed a meeting. He counsels young bangers on how to get out. It doesn't mean he didn't get back in. Let's not forget he ran. His sister says he didn't wanna get caught with Hector's smokes. - Lf his sister says he's clean... - What about his gang tats? Tigre says he's getting them lasered off. Wait a minute. His sister has a name now? Can we just talk to Chaco, hear his side of things? I hope to hell you're wrong, man. - You want me to pass it on to the DA? - Not yet. I'll go to the hospital to get answers from the father. Come on, I'll walk you out. - Rebecca wants you to meet Warner. - I don't want to. - He's her fiancé. - She has a husband. They come 3000 miles from Boston, and you won't see your daughter? I'm dying to see Rebecca, but I don't think it's fair I have to meet him... ...when we should be trying to save her marriage. She won't leave Warner alone in a hotel room. - Well, there you go. - Don't be so hard, Peaches. I'm not. Rebecca's been married to Gordon 1 1 months, and she's giving up? - Do you think she really tried? - She's a big girl now. Where'd you park? Rebecca and Warner dropped me off on their way to the Getty. - I'll give you a ride back. - I'm staying a while. Dutch has offered to show me around. The only thing I'm guilty for is trying to protect Tigre. - Why'd you run? - Stolen cigs, Los Mag tats. - I knew you wouldn't believe me. - You were right. Not to mention planting that gun. That's my third strike. - They planted the gun on you? - No way. Next time check your pockets before leaving the house. - Why don't we get to what matters? - What's that? How will you protect her? Hector finds out the cops got his cigarettes, he'll think she called it in. Hector's gonna wanna do a lot worse than beat her. Where does Hector keep his stolen merch? Who's in your crew? I don't live that life anymore. Now, she needs protection. She'll get it. That must've hurt like a mother, getting that thing lasered off. Yeah. Worse than getting shot. This isn't good. I believe him. - Me too. - Christ, man, I knew it. Third strike, and all he cares about is his sister. - We set up the wrong guy. - What if I'd killed him? - You didn't. - But I could've. - Oh, man. - What did I do? Okay, what do we do now? I don't know. - Yo, we gotta clear this guy. - Nobody's arguing. Well, how do we make the gun charge just disappear? We make the gun disappear. Sneak into the evidence room. That place is like Grand Central Station. During the day. We'll hit it tonight. For now, we get the right guy. Find Hector, sit on him and be there when he moves on his next job. Well, what if his next job's Tigre? Lem, you babysit Tigre. Ronnie, you're on Hector patrol with me. We made this mess, we're gonna clean it up. Hang on a second. - Hello? - Where are you? You've been gone since yesterday. Yeah. I'm still working on this. Matthew has been calling for you since this morning. He needs you here. - I know. - I thought you made an arrest. - There's more. - I need a prescription from Rite Aid. - Well, is the babysitter there? - Yes. Well, go. I'd have to leave her with the kids. We hired a babysitter you don't trust with the kids? When are you coming home? Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Hey. How do you think the Dodgers are gonna do this year? I don't follow baseball. Would it be profiling if I said I bet you follow basketball? Actually, I heard you were a Clippers fan. - Yeah. - Two tickets. Floor seats. I can't make it. We gotta roll. I'm putting together a softball team to take on those beach cops in Venice. I'm penciling you in. Center fielder. Talk to you later. - You're here. - As promised. - Nice bike. - Thanks. - Hope you chained it. - You ride? - Because I'm a gang chick? - Just wanted to know if you rode. - So how's this work? - I keep you safe until we arrest Hector. What do you think you're doing? Hey! - I think I got it covered. - You think? Yeah. Ain't nobody getting past me. I see they've got you in the ambassador suite. - Who's that? - Detective Wyms, Maynard. Social Services already told me they're taking me away. I just wanted to know what happened to your wife. Mona. Ran away. How long ago? Five, six years, maybe even. No note, no message, no goodbye. No. How do you know she ran away? Lloyd told me. What else did Lloyd tell you? - So, what kind of work do you do? - I'm a stylist. - Hair? - Yeah. - So you could do my hair? - Yeah. Cut it off and start over. It's not that bad, is it? - I could do some things. - Yeah, maybe after we get Hector. Maybe. You know, you could help. Tell me where Hector's next job's gonna be. - I don't know. - I believe your brother. You, I'm not so sure. - Why? - He's not afraid of Hector, and you are. Hector's scary. I deal with shit like Hector every day. He's not as scary as you think. He says I'm his. Oh, man, this is fresh. When did he do that? Last night, when I didn't wanna let him in with his stolen smokes. Looks like they're scoping out their next job. You know, Lem's feeling pretty down. Better than letting some asshole shoot me. Oh, what the hell is this? Lem! - Hey, yo, you Hector? - Who are you, homes? Check out this vato... Come on. You like that, huh? Police! Police! Hey, give me some pavement! Give me some pavement! That's for Tigre, asshole. Stay away from her! - Lem! - No, man, he branded her! You mess with me and Tigre, and you're dead too, homes. Oh, you think I'm scared of you? Goddamn it! Back off, back off! That's right, bitch ass. - Goddamn it, man. - Bitch! You should've seen what he did to her. He needed a lesson. They were getting ready to roll on a job. Fifteen to 20 would've been a great lesson. Sure was a nice ass-whupping, though. Hey, that's not the point. Our mission was to catch Hector red-handed... ...bring him in, break him, lock him up and stop the jackings. Well, what about getting Chaco off? When we getting that gun? I said, tonight. Now, are you protecting the sister or just getting in my way? - You're back. - I learned some interesting things. So did I. You were a classical dancer when you were a teenager? Okay. My father is now off-limits to you. Where is he? - How could you not share that? - I only studied nine months. - In Paris. - Do your thing... ...and stop stalking me. - It's only stalking if you work at it. Your father just opened right up. - What exactly is my thing? - Dig. - On the elderly abuse case? - How about elderly murder? The son's cashing in the mother's Social Security checks. She's nowhere to be found. If he treats his father like this... ...who knows what he did to the mom. - Interesting. Maynard's got five other kids. I'll make some calls. One must know something. I'll search the database and see if I can sniff a trail. Oh, and your daughter and her fiancé'll be here in a half an hour. What? Come in. - You wanted to see me. - Yes, Danny. So Julien asked you about reassignment? I wanted to talk to you about a different matter. What's that? I have a friend in Administration. I asked to see the early results of the sergeant's exam. Yeah? You missed the cut-off, Danny, by three points. - You mean I failed? - Three points is nothing. Oh, goddamn it. I worked hard. I studied with Dutch. I even got a good night's sleep. - Lf I didn't pass this time... - You'll pass next time. - You expect me to take it again? - Yeah. And I expect you to pass it. David, send someone over to... Who was the criminologist that night? - You write that down? - I did. I'm not sure. Check the book. Goddamn it. I used to do this for Chaco when he was banging. - It feels good. - Does it? Yeah. - I wish I could've been there. - I wish I could've done more. You know, Hector needs to be locked up, not Chaco. - And what're you doing about that? - You gotta have faith in me. We'll see. Tigre, there's something that I have to tell you. Yeah? What's that? What? I shot your brother. - It wasn't the other guy? - I thought he'd kill my boss. - Are you the one that planted the gun? - Nobody planted a gun. - I don't want you here. - You need someone here. - Hector will kill you. - I don't wanna see your face! You shot Chaco. What's to stop me from shooting you? - Nothing. - You shoot Chaco... ...then try to get in my pants for laughs? That's not... Look, I made a mistake. We're gonna get Chaco off. I promise you. Come on! Come on! Come on! I'm right here, assholes! Punk ass! - Hey, Cacuzza. - Hey. I need some help. What's up? - You live in the Valley, right? - Yeah. You thinking of moving? - Yeah. - Yeah? You wanna be nearer to me, huh? Who wouldn't? Any suggestions? Yeah, West Hills, where I live, is nice. I think there's a West Hills for rent on the bulletin board. - Can you take a look? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Oh, let me just lock up real quick. Hey, Cacuzza, sleeping on the job again? I'm right here. - Hey. - Hey. I know Ronnie was looking for you. I see you found him. You aren't trying to pull one of your pranks on me? No, no, I really wanna move. Right. And a man's just as good as a vibrator. What are you guys up to? Nothing. Okay. But I'm watching you two. Excuse me, this is your father we're talking about. Thank you very much for your time, then. Every one of Maynard's kids hopes he rots in hell. - Have no clue where the mother is. - I ran the wife's maiden name. Got some hits in Virginia. It's East Coast time. I'll call in the morning. - Mom? - Oh, sweetheart. Hello. - Mom, this is Warner. - How do you do, Warner? I've waited a long time to meet you, Claudette. - Couldn't have been that long. - I'm starving. Can we dine? There's a diner on the corner. Claudette loves it there. Well, come on. So, Warner, how do you like Los Angeles? It's big. How did you meet Rebecca? Parent-teacher conference. She taught my 9-year-old. She's a great teacher. Both my boys love her. I see. - You see what? - Peaches. Don't call me that. I'm trying to figure out if he wants a wife or a babysitter. You know, maybe I should go back to the hotel. No, baby, I'm sorry. Just... How can you say that? Don't throw away your future. Gordon loved you. - Gordon and I had problems. - You never gave him a chance. - Give Warner a chance. - You knew how I felt. You think forcing Warner on me would make a difference? I thought you'd be open-minded about getting to know him. And I thought you'd be open-minded about trying to save your marriage. Well, at least everyone is finally talking. Come on, let's go to dinner. - Did you get it? - No. Goddamn it. - Where is the sister? - She's at a roadside inn. It's safe. I had to chase off two of Hector's boys. What are we gonna do about the gun? I doubt Cacuzza will give us another chance. Once that thing hits Central Storage, that place is like Fort Knox. - How bad you wanna make this right? - Why? You ever wonder how evidence gets from here to Central Storage? You're gonna think I'm helpless. No. I was planning on making you a surprise dinner. Had the blender, the microwave, the TV going, and the lights went black. You overloaded the circuit. - Well, how do I unload it? - It's easy. There's a switch in the breaker box. You have no idea how to do any of this, do you? Maybe you trip my switch. Who's that? Danny, hi. - Are you seeing her? - Kim? Yeah. It's new, but it seems to be going fairly well. - That's great. - Yeah, so far. - Dutch, can I see you? - Oh, excuse me. Good for you. What do you got? You should be feeling pretty good now. I don't know why. Hasn't been a little dry lately? Only in a Death Valley kind of way. It's good you're dating someone. Even better, she doesn't work here. So there you are. What are you doing here? He wanted to see how we match fingerprints. Shouldn't you be trying to track down our missing mom? I found someone with her maiden name in Virginia Beach. All I have to do is check the Social Security number. - And I'll do that now. - Thank you. Rebecca is leaving tomorrow morning. Have dinner with us tonight. - And repeat last night's scene? - I'll referee this time. There's no fight if I'm not there. I remember a brilliant scholar who chose to go into police work... ...against my advice. - I wasn't brilliant. - Yes, you were. I was mortified. - You still are. No. I've come to understand your decision. When I'm your age, maybe I'll come to understand hers. Peaches, I'm 30 years older and smarter than you are. You're not that much smarter. Maybe a year or two. - Hey, Lowe. - Yeah. Johnson's having a little retirement bash next week. There's room for one more. You want me to get you in? - No, thanks. - Come on. - You get to meet some of the top brass. - I'm sorry. Fine. But if something else comes up, I'm gonna keep you in the loop. What do you want? You looked out for me. I'm just trying to return the favor. I've seen the kind of favors you do. Let's start out on a new page. You're not my friend, so stop pretending. Hello? - Is this Mona Gaines? - Yeah. This is Detective Claudette Wyms. I'm a detective in Los Angeles. - What's this about? - Were you formerly Mona Hawkins? What do you want? Are you aware that your son is still receiving your Social Security checks? I don't care about that, so long as they don't contact me. You know Lloyd's guilty of abusing Maynard... ...and defrauding the federal government? That's not my problem. Don't call me back. I guess she wasn't murdered. One hell of a family. What do you want? Hey, you tell Hector Tigre's mine now. He's got a problem, he can meet me at 1 1:00, L.A. River at Whipple. I'll kick all three of your asses at the same time, all right? No cops, just us. - It's on then, homes. - All right, bitch. - Don't tell me you're putting one there. - I am. What do you need? Temporary body art, just like the one I showed you before. You're all done. Let's do it. Wash your hands first. Oh, jeez! Oh, God. Please, please, don't hurt me. - I said the green car. - You said the blue. Now I'm saying run the tape to the green car. Fine. What the hell happened here? The police evidence van was robbed. Robbed? You gotta be kidding me. - What'd they take? - A gun. - That's it? - Yeah, that's it. L-M stands for Los Magnificos. Guess what? It was Chaco's gun. Goddamn it. He just bailed out his seńorita's brother. - Hold on. What're you talking about? - Hector Estanza, Los Mags. The guy Lem shot, Chaco, who's in the hospital on that weapons charge. Without the gun, Chaco will walk. You get a good look at them? Just a weird tattoo on the ringleader. What'd it look like? A snake with wings on it. That's Hector. You give us the word, we'll go pick him up. Go get him. Hi. Grandpa said you couldn't have dinner with us... ...and I wanted to say goodbye. - I still love you. - Let's just agree to disagree. - Fine. - Where's the ladies' room? - Right over there. I'll show you. This is not your typical police station. Bryce was telling me a little bit about its history. Care for a tour? And this is one of our interrogation rooms. Oh, man. So this is where you break them. Suspected rapists, murderers, child molesters. We sit them all down right there. Wanna see how it feels? Okay. - Where's Mom and Warner? - I don't know. You aware just how smart my daughter is? Oh, yeah, she's smart as a whip. She's smarter than a whip. That's just an expression. I do love her, you know. So it's not just your kids who love her? If my kids hated her, I'd have trouble deciding who to keep. Don't make jokes about giving up your kids, Warner. No, ma'am, I didn't mean it like that. She's a public school teacher now... ...but she's got the potential to go much further. She plans on getting her doctorate. She talked about writing a book. I want Rebecca to achieve everything she wants. You've got all the right answers today. But marriage is about having the right answers every day. I'm watching you, Warner. Like a hawk, ma'am. Hit the ground, scumbag! Freeze, freeze! - Hands up! - Turn around, turn around. Get on your knees. I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed. He doesn't put up a fight unless you wear a dress. You're the vatos that will be disappointed, homes. Yeah? How so? When you let me go for no evidence. - Haven't you heard? - Heard what, ése? You robbed a police vehicle today, vato. Keep dreaming. I was at the L.A. River waiting for that punk ass to show up. Man, you must be high. Oh, look what we got here. Recently fired. You better hope that doesn't match the bullets in that police evidence van. - It's not mine, homes. - The van had your gang's tag on it. The cop identified your tattoo. Ballistics is gonna come back a match. You vatos set me up! Yeah, like a jury's never heard that one before. On your knees. - Get on your knees. - Get down. Have a seat. I saw the two of you bickering over police tape this afternoon. - Anything to say? - He couldn't follow orders. I'm not a mind reader. If she said it, I would've done it. If I separate you, you'll carry your baggage somewhere else. I believe in solving problems, not shuffling them around. So let's identify the problem. Julien? - Communication. - Trust. Trust comes from communication. So how are we gonna fix this? Department workshop? Or maybe I should set you up with the city shrink. Any of that sound like fun? - Not really. - Nope. Prove to me that you can watch each other's backs... ...and then I'll trust that you can watch another partner's back. And don't bother me with this anymore. So, Dutch, join us. I've got a feeling he's got his own date. - Actually, I do. - Well, thanks for showing me around. - Thanks for telling me about Peaches. - Come on. So how did it go with Warner? I didn't have enough to make an arrest. Hey. Hon? How's Matthew today? He kept asking where you were, and I didn't know what to tell him. I'm sorry. How'd it go with the babysitter? I fired her. - Why? - She just created more work. I had to explain everything to her... ...and she had no idea how to handle Matthew. He needs you. We need you. What am I supposed to do? Quit my job? Wanting us to be a family doesn't make me a shrew. - Something important came up. - Well, something always does. This isn't working. - What're you talking about? - Something has to change. You'll receive good care at this place, Maynard. - Where's Lloyd? - Oh, he's with us. You'll be better off. Maynard, why do your kids hate you so much? Here we go. I was a bastard. Too late to change my mind about dinner?
