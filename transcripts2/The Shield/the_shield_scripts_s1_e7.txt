 Previously on The Shield: The next 2 4 hours, she's your one and only case. Prostitute. Age 1 2 to 1 4. Had a sweet tooth. Guy who murdered Sally is out there. I'm here with my dick in my hand... ...because this guy thought it'd be funny to rake his buddy over the coals. You're lucky. Matthew is a charming, intelligent boy. He also has autism. Autism? I don't think I can sell a cop to these voters. What would you think of a man who exposed corruption... ...brought down dirty cops from inside the department? I'd think he was committing professional suicide.

 - But could you sell him to the voters? - Absolutely. - Bag it. - Bag it. - Bag it. - Bag it. Bag it. I wanna know what you found in the Navigator. Isn't a stolen-car case below your radar? Where are the drugs? - I saw them pocket the cocaine. - I told you to let this go. I may answer to you, but I also answer to God. Cops here will treat you like a traitor. You'll take more shit than ever. - Are you ready for that kind of heat? - I'll have to be. You done already? I need someone to listen to me.

 - I'm busy. Maybe one of the uniforms... - I said, I need someone to listen to me. Okay. Did you wanna report a crime? I've lost track of all the crimes. - I don't understand... - I've lived here all my life... ...keeping my complaints to myself. But no more. My apartment has been broken into seven times in the last four years. Seven times! And you never catch anyone! You have got graffiti and cuss words on every single wall that you see! I've got needles on my sidewalk, beer cans on my lawn... ...and I stopped ducking at the sound of gunshot years ago. We can drop smart bombs down chimneys half a world away. But some sicko gets released from jail because of a computer screwup... ...and rapes my niece. How does this make sense? I see yellow police tape everywhere that I go. And it's all sirens and helicopters and searchlights. You've got mothers killing their children... ...children killing strangers, maniacs flying airplanes into buildings... ...and I just want life to go back to the way that it should have been. What are you doing to make us feel safe? I love the action, but what are we doing in Watts? We got eight people dead. Nine, if you count the fetus. - Gang war on steroids. - Chief doesn't like headlines. If my ass is on the line, I want my best man covering me. Appreciate the compliment... ...but won't Northwest get pissed with me and Shane on their turf? - The lead detective is Carlos Zamora. - Never heard of him. He's a comer, but he's raw. Built his reputation working with gangs. Knows them inside out. - He know how we work? - Let him do his thing... ...you do your thing. I don't care, as long as it gets cracked. Carlos, Vic Mackey. Shane Vendrell. - Thanks for helping. - What gang were they in? - Toros. Biggest and baddest here. - Cameras catch this guy? Just for show. VCRs weren't hooked up. - Who's the mom-to-be? - Lucy. She was Train's girl. - Train? - Train Gutierrez. He runs the Toros. Well, Train's gonna wanna retaliate bigtime. We find who he's targeting, we find who did this. I'll talk to Train, make sure his guys don't do anything stupid. What makes you think he'll listen? I used to be a Toro back in the day. I've been able to keep a pretty good lid on things. Looks like the lid just got blown off. The owner said there's a high school kid... ...who sweeps up at night. Wasn't part of the body count. - Kid call in sick? - No. He should've been here. Name is Jaime. You seeing this? - Goddamn Oprah Winfrey hour. - Paging Dr. Phil. No wonder Gilroy called us up. A gang war's about to explode and he's playing grief counselor to the soldiers. You gotta let me handle this, Train, me entiendes? He's right. We'll handle it. I'm working this case with Carlos. Who would wanna start a war with you? - Things been peaceful, eh. - Until tonight. So who was it? - I told you, we've been handling things. - Right. - What's that bulge in your jacket? - Yo, chill, dog. Come on, man. What? What? Concealed weapon. - Suspicious white powder. - Daily double. So do I have to search all you guys, or do I get some answers? Is it the blacks, Chinese, Los Mags? Who're we talking about? The blacks. Wet Willie. He's been making noise since he got paroled. What do you know? A clue. Hey! Why are you shaking down these guys? They trust me. - Yeah. I saw the circle jerk. - You treat them like people, it works. So does treating them like the killing, dealing, thieving scumbags they are. Mop-up boy went MIA tonight. See if you can track him down. - Where you going? - Talk to Wet Willie. I can do it. I know where to find Wet Willie. Hey, this might be your district, but it's my world. Different ZIP code, same pinheads. Describe what you witnessed then. Mackey put four bricks of cocaine into evidence bags, two into weapons bags. - Then he gave it to Shane, I think. - You think? You "think" is not "I'm sure." I called IAD because you said you were sure. - Okay. - This is serious, Julien. There's no point in doing the right thing... ...if your testimony is vague. - I know. Now, did Mackey give Shane the cocaine then or did it happen later? - No, it happened then. - Then say that. The statement you give to Frances... ...Mackey's lawyers will twist it into anything but the truth. - Do I have to say this in open court? - Hopefully not. It won't be good publicity for Vic or the department. If it goes the way I've planned, they'll take a plea. - They'll lose their jobs? - Oh, yeah. Jail? Julien. Are you okay living with that? What's fair for them out there has to be fair for us in here. Facing Autism? What's up with that? That's Corrine's book. A kid in Matthew's class just got diagnosed. Oh, man, that's tough. Family must be devastated, huh? Yeah. I had this cousin who was retarded. Autism isn't the same thing as being retarded. What is it, like Rain Man, freaking out, counting matchsticks kind of thing? No. It's not the same thing. You don't care to educate yourself, why don't you keep your mouth shut. Describe what you saw at that point. Detective Mackey placed four bricks of cocaine into two evidence bags. He then took two bricks and placed it into a weapons bag... ... which he immediately handed to Detective Vendrell. - Hey. I thought you were off today. - I am. - What are you doing here? - Taking care of business. I'm glad I caught you. I've been trying to figure out how to handle this thing. - And I had this idea... - I don't wanna talk about it. Julien, I'm your training officer. You owe it to me to at least see if... No offense, but I'm gonna go my own way on this. Okay, here's Wet Willie. Take his buddy. Keep him out of my way. Go. Wet Willie! Police! Stop! - I said, stop! - I'll be with you in a minute. Goddamn it! I said, stop! - You got the medicine? - Right here. Now, what do you want? - What you sweating me for? - I'm a cop. Slow down. Slow down. Right here. Hands behind your head. - I didn't do nothing. - Ever? Or in the last 1 0 minutes, Kunta Kinte? Suck my dick. - What'd you say? Suck your what? - Screw you. So you've been with your sick kid all night? - He's been throwing up all over me. - The mom can back you up? My girlfriend, her sister, her friend, the nurse at the free clinic. Man, why? Never mind. Suck your what? Suck your what? - Hey. Shane! - What's going on out there? - Suck that, you piece of shit. - Shane! Shane! - What are you doing? - Patty, call the police. - Shane! Let's go! - Call the police. - What's going on out there? - Get the license plate! - Are you out of your goddamn mind? - No! We're trying to prevent the war, not start one, you stupid... Goddamn. The guy was a pain in the ass. You're being a huge pain in the ass lately. Should I take a piss on you? - You're out of control. - You want me out, say the word. And don't think I won't! You've gone over those things 1 0 times already. He's a serial killer. Sally won't be his last victim unless I catch him. - You're obsessed. - I'm dedicated. Hey, hey. Come with me. You're too dedicated. You need a gimme to cleanse your palate. - Low-priority files? - Pick a card, any card. What's the point of this? We take half a day, we make some citizen happy... ...and go back to your serial-killer case on a winning streak. - I don't have time for games. - You're running in circles. Now, I've got the cure. So pick a card. My mother's being robbed by a psychic. - A psychic? - Her name's Frida. She's bilked my mom and her friends out of thousands of dollars. What's the scam? Tainted-money con, third-party ritual, elixir machine? She claims to talk to my dead father. My mom took out a second mortgage on the house... ...to pay Frida for contacting the spirit world. But that's supposed to be my house someday. - Well, that is a problem. - I know. What are you gonna do? - Any luck with Wet Willie? - He's not the guy. We better find out who is before Train makes a guess and starts shooting. - Got a line on our missing mop-up boy. - Yeah? A gangbanger friend of his called me and told me where he is. - A banger just called you up? - I told you, man, these guys trust me. Jaime's bragging he saw the shooter come out of the gun club. - Great. Where do I find this Jaime? - I got this one. Wanna back me up? Just follow my taillights. You sure you don't want one of these? You look awfully tense. I just testified before IAD. I don't get why you'd complicate your life by narc'ing out another cop. Because in my life, I take personal responsibility. You might wanna try it sometime. Ouch. Skipping out on restaurant bills, outstanding warrants. - You don't even have a job. - I make money here and there. I'm a cop. I know what "here and there" means. If this is what you're like, I can't be around you. I really think you could use a beer. When this housesitting gig ends, you won't have a place to live. - Oh, whatever will I do? - I'm serious. Do you even have a plan? When was the last time you even applied for a job? What's your plan? To keep pretending you're something you're not? - It's not that easy. - I'll try if you'll try. - Jaime? - Nah, Jaime left. Try again, smart-ass. Finish your drinks somewhere else. Jaime, we hear you saw the gun-club shooter tonight. What colors was he wearing? Stop posing for a picture and start yapping. - You saw the shooter, right? - Maybe. - What gang was the shooter in? - You know who the shooter runs with? No. You're not blind, and you only seem half stupid... ...so I bet you got a good guess who this guy's affiliated with. Tell us. - You guys ain't listening. - What gang was the shooter in? The white people's gang. Our shooter is white? - Early to mid-30s. - Gringo with a grudge. - There goes our gang-war theory. - More headlines the chief won't like. The Latino community is on edge. Raoul Jimenez is on his way to hear our progress. Jimenez? He run out of janitor strikes to organize? What pisses you off more? That he fights the establishment... ...or that he usually wins? Thanks for the new partner, by the way. - It's a hate crime. - We don't know what it is yet. A white man kills eight Latinos, and you don't know if it's a hate crime? My people are scared. What are the police doing? - We got a drawing of the shooter. - Even the artist won't vouch for that. Our witness didn't see much past the white skin. Release it to the press. Maybe someone will recognize him. It's so vague, every Anglo on the street is gonna look like a suspect. - Now you know how we feel every day. - Please. Save it for the microphones. I think it's important the public knows who the enemy is. It's a waste of time, Ben. Release the sketch. Since when do we kowtow to the "Mexico First" crowd? If we don't include him, he'll make our lives hell. Let him try. Have you driven around the city lately? He's the majority now. - We're still wearing the badges. - Yeah, for the time being. How is screwing up an investigation gonna keep Jimenez off our backs? I'm counting on you not to screw it up. Bring in this killer and we keep our badges another day. - Hey, no one's taking mine away. - We're dinosaurs, Vic. And make no mistake, the meteor's coming. Your son says you're being swindled by this psychic. Frida's not a psychic, she's a medium. She predicted Gene would go to the police, didn't she? Yes. She said Gene was waiting for me to die so he could get my money. You do know these so-called psychics are all frauds, right? Well, most of them are, but not Frida. She brings me messages from Frank. - Frank? - He was my husband. Cancer got him. How do you think Frank would feel if you lost the house you lived in... ...to keep paying this medium? I'd pay anything to talk to Frank. - Detective Mackey? I'm with... - IAD. Yeah, I remember. An investigation has been initiated into your actions on April 2nd. Look over these charges and decide if you'd like a formal interview. Vic. We got five people shot dead in a family grocer's, all Latinos. - This one's in your district. - I'll have to get back to you. Here they come. Secure the front. Don't let anybody else in, okay? - Officer. - Detectives. - What happened? - Guy came in blasting. Killed everybody in here except the owner in back. He heard the shots, came out with a baseball bat and ran the shooter off. - Where's the owner now? - He's pretty upset. This was his son. - My boy. - You were back here? - Yes. - And you grabbed the baseball bat? That baseball bat over there? Now, the shooter, he was white? What happened after you chased him out? - He got away. - On foot? He didn't get into a car? - No. - Well, which way did he run? I don't remember. There's blood on this bat. Did you hit him with it? I guess. I don't remember. Our bad guy may have ran away, but this being L. A... ...l'm guessing he drove here. Check the plates on these cars. Match them up and see what stands out. You want me doing grunt work? Yeah. Because, A, it's important... ...and B, I don't really feel like hearing you talk this morning. I got a 1 0-square-block perimeter being roped off. If he's on foot and bleeding, we'll get him. Oh, gee, I wonder what took them so long. Can I help you? We're investigating complaints about your business practices. I offer a money-back guarantee to those who are unhappy. Very few people request it. Six hundred dollars for a candle? Looks like the kind I get at the 99-cent store. The candle itself is ordinary. It's the blessing ceremony that makes them so valuable. Blessing ceremony. What does that entail? Taking the price tag off, sticking it on a shelf? We'd like you to come with us, answer a few questions. You yearn for a young woman who doesn't yearn after you. What? You see I'm not wearing a ring, you figure a guy who shops at the... ...99-cent store is single and has the hots for some woman out of his league. Is now when I fork over a week's salary for a candle, or? She's someone that you work with or work close by. Come on, let's go. You're wasting your time with her, you know. Frances will ask about the night you stole the truck. And this'll clean the slate on all my charges, right? Right. So long as you tell the truth. - So how do you want me to do it? - Do what? Tell my story. I mean, you're paying, so you get to pick. I can be all sweet and innocenty, like: I don't know what possessed me to steal the truck that night... ...but when I found those bags of cocaine inside, I got so scared. Or I can be all biker-chick, master-thief girl. Like: I ripped the Navigator, was on my way to get it chopped... ...and I stumble across these two keys of blow. - How about sincere and honest? - Not my best one. - Don't get too cute with her. - But I am cute. - Are you involved with anyone? - Excuse me? Well, my most recent lover just died of a drug overdose... ...thanks to high-octane stolen coke, so I find myself sexually available. If by involved you mean married with a baby girl, then the answer is yes. Damn. Think of the things I could get away with if I was banging a captain. Stay out of trouble so I don't have to see you again. - Oh, but you wanna see me again. - No, I don't. If I was 1 8 and single, maybe it'd be a different story. Oh, I would've chewed you up and spit you out when you were 1 8. I wouldn't be so sure. The other shop owners tell the same story. They heard gunshots, but didn't see anything. Nobody looked out and saw which way this guy went running? - That's what they say. - That doesn't pass the smell test. Vic! This is the only car whose owner is unaccounted for. Check it out. - Spare ammo. - Who's the car registered to? - A George Michael Klassen. - Nice to meet you, you sick prick. All clear. Oh, goddamn it. As I was going through the truck, I found... ...some guns and two bags of cocaine. Okay, let's go back to stealing the vehicle. You saw Detective Vendrell park the truck, get out... - ... and go inside the building. - Yes, ma'am. And no one went in or out of the truck between the time... ... he left it and the time you stole it. No, ma'am. It's always sad when the people that you expect to enforce the law... ...break it themselves. Canvass the place. Find out if anybody saw a car pulling out. We found two bodies inside. They're George's in-laws. - Oh, my God. - But his wife and son, they're not here. We're afraid George might have taken them with him. Any idea where your brother might have gone? No. Any place he might feel comfortable hiding? - No. - This is important. We have to find him before he does any harm to them. Well, I can't imagine George would ever hurt Myra or Brady. Can you imagine him killing 1 5 people in cold blood? Well, that's different. I mean, you have to understand. This used to be a nice place to live. Clean, safe. George just got fed up being surrounded by all the spics. Can you blame him? Klassen's picture's plastered all over the news. He can't step outside without somebody spotting him. That doesn't help us save his wife and boy. I'm more concerned about what you're doing to stop the next attack. Everything we can. We know who he is. We got his car. We got units on his family and friends. We got every base covered. Waiting around for him to make his next move isn't gonna cut it. Where you going? Hey, as long as he's got it all covered, I'm gonna go check on something. Getting a nice tan? About all I'm good for, I guess. - You find any blood out here? - Nope. So there was blood on the bat and nowhere else? There's some blood in the store unconnected to any of the victims. Show me. Shooter loses this much blood and doesn't drip any on the pavement? Maybe he went out the back. - SID check it? - Beats me. Looks like somebody did a nice little sweep job. Yes, it does. Makes you wonder why. You know, Houdini wanted desperately to believe in the paranormal. Couldn't abide the fakes and frauds. Spent his life trying to debunk them. Still held out hope, though. Before he died, he gave his wife Beatrice a secret password... ...that he promised her he'd try to send her from the afterworld... ...so she could tell the difference between phonies and the real McCoys. When he passed away, Beatrice traveled the globe... ...met with every gypsy, psychic, tarot-card reader she could find. Not one of them ever got the password right. Houdini should have had a little more faith. - Faith? - On Sundays they call it Christianity. The afterlife's no different. Church only takes you for 1 0 percent. You've been wringing these ladies dry. If they refuse to press charges, you can't touch me. If I find out you still have your hooks in these women... ...l'll find other charges to press. - Fire code violations. - Parking tickets. Zoning laws. You name it, I'll find it. How's your future looking now? What do you want from me? It's time to get some new marks, honey. What the hell is he doing? - You arrested the shop owners? - Brought them in for questioning. - Why? - Their stories didn't make sense. Leon's son died four hours ago. How much sense is he supposed to make? If he knows something, we need it. You don't interrogate a grieving father! And you don't get answers from people by passing around hugs. You don't get them by pissing on people either. We've got a racist madman targeting Latinos... ...and you want to interrogate the victim's family?! When you trade your megaphone for a badge, that's when I'll seek your input. I insist on witnessing the interviews... ...to ensure these men and women aren't mistreated. - No. - Excuse me? I've included you as a courtesy. It's time to give my men the space to do their jobs. His wife and 1 0-year-old son are missing. - My son's dead. - You're not telling me the truth, Leon. - Yes, I am. - You know something. No. If you're lying so you can get to your son's killer before us to get revenge... ...I can't let that happen. - I don't know anything. Then why are you and the other shop owners all telling the same lie? And why did someone sweep the path in the back alley after the shootings? Leon? You can tell me. What did you really see? I didn't see nothing. I just talked with Frances. You've got her looking into the Strike Team again? Yes. You ever plan on telling me about it? I didn't wanna bother you with it until things were more definitive. I got a problem in this squad, David. My captain and my best cop aren't getting along. We stand for different things. Well, you better make friends, or I'm gonna have to make a choice. And I don't think you're gonna like that choice. Maybe you should read this before you make any choices. You're gonna need a signature on this here... I've been getting some very strong signals at this desk. Gee, the desk that I work at? Spooky. I'm getting an S name. Is there a Sarah? Sorry, no Sarahs. Or a Sally. I think there's a Sally. Do you know who I'm talking about? You going through my desk? Reading my file on Sally? No, I didn't. Frida! There you are! - Are you all right? - Fine. Yeah. Let's all talk in another room. Follow me. She has a message for you. There's an innocent woman and an innocent kid in danger out there... ...and you're not telling me the truth! - Yes, I am! Someone's holding a gun to their heads right now... ...and you're stopping me from finding them. I'm not. You might as well be pulling the trigger. Tell me the truth! - I am! - He doesn't know anything. Yes, he does. - You gonna pull the trigger on that kid? - Vic! What does that make you? - What if it was your boy? - My boy's dead. That's because I couldn't stop the racist pig from pulling that trigger. Don't be like the man who killed your son. - I'm nothing like him. - Then show me. Show me. I heard the shots... ...the shots that killed Favian. When I came outside, the man was standing there with his... With his back to me. I hit him with a baseball bat. Knocked him out. What did you do with him? My friends heard the noise. They came over. They dragged him out the back. That's why we swept up afterwards. - What did you do with him? - He killed my boy. - I know. - So I wanted to kill him back. I know. I couldn't do it, though. I didn't have the courage. So, what did you do with him? We gave him to the Toros. I couldn't kill him... ...but I knew they would. Oh, shit. The in-laws were killed after the grocery shootings. - So Train or his guys killed them. - They got the wife and kid. God help you. Look out! Heads up! - Where's Train? - Get him off me! I can't do that, Lucas. You went too far. What did you do? - He had it coming. - Did the wife and kid have it coming? - We were making things better. - We didn't start the killing. Where's Train keeping his family? You wanna tell me with your teeth or without? He's not gonna let you beat me down. He's one of us. Not after what you did. Now, where do we find this guy's wife and kid? You didn't see this coming. You didn't see this. - Please don't hurt him. - What? What? You wanna kiss me? Please, don't. We'll do anything you want. Just... No. - Let go. Please. George! - Don't touch my mom! Brady! No! - Train! Don't do this, Train! - Put it down! - For Lucy. - No! He had to pay. And who's gonna pay now? Who's gonna pay? We all pay, man. He's gonna pay for the rest of his life. You don't want to. Trust me. It's okay. You're all right. We've gotta get Vic Mackey off the streets. - Have you taken his statement yet? - No. - But you have to admit, it looks bad. - Very bad. We need to keep this thing under control. How can we? The chief is gonna have a heart attack when he hears about this. If the press gets ahold of it... Goddamn it. This is the last thing I needed. I'll talk to my people, make sure there are no leaks on this end. Yeah, me too. Okay. Good. I just need a few days to figure out how to handle this. - What's going to happen to them? - What do you think? They handed a man over to gangbangers to be killed. They handed over a hatemonger. Their actions led to three people being killed. And a woman being sexually assaulted in front of her 1 0-year-old son. - They couldn't have foreseen that. - They conspired to kill a man... ...and then tried to cover it up. They're victims. My group won't let this department turn them into martyrs. I thought martyrs are what brought in the donations... ...and got your name in the papers. I'll see they don't spend one day in jail. They probably won't. I should get going. Can I give you a lift? No, I got one. Thanks for the offer, though. Offer's always good. Sir, do you have a minute? Sorry. I missed dinner. What can I do for you? I don't think that Julien and I are turning out to be a good match. - Really? - I just think he might be better off... ...with a different training officer. Finnegan's not riding with anyone. - I could take the next candidate. - Julien's going through a tough time. He needs you now more than ever. You're as good as we have. You'll work things out. - How could you do this? - It was a mistake. We were gonna use the coke for an undercover bust. I didn't do the paperwork. When it got stolen with the truck... - Is that what you plan on telling IAD? - Come on, what do they have? - A car thief as a witness? Please. - She's convincing. Plus, there's the officer who saw you take the stuff in the first place. They've established chain of custody. From you to the truck to the OD victim. Shane was the one in possession of the drugs. - He's the one that got the truck stolen. - Ben, no! I don't have the juice anymore to protect all of you. Shane had the drugs. We lay it all on his doorstep. It's either that or you two can share a cell. You don't have to like it, but it's time to serve him up. - I was just about to close. - What was Sally's message? - She says not to give up. - I haven't. She says you're the only one still fighting for her. What else did she say? You have something for me? An IAD file of a current investigation my people are trying to cover up. Dirty cops? Why give it to me? You'll see it gets the publicity it deserves. And if you leak it to the press, it'd look self-serving. You want it or not? Of course. Don't worry, David. I'll make sure they spell your name right. That's my book. The reason I have it is because Matthew has autism. - We found out a few weeks ago. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh, Vic. Vic, I'm sorry. - It's been tough. Lot of work. You know, the one thing I've learned is... ...I goddamn love that kid more now than ever. Hey, he's got problems, you know... ...but I'm never giving up on him. I'm not giving up on you either, Shane. I'm gonna have to get a little creative on this "past job experience" section. Creative's cool. Just don't lie. Though I might need a few glasses of wine to get that creative. Let me just skip on down here to the... What's this? References. References. It wouldn't hurt to have a glowing one from a respected city police officer. - What, you're not gonna help me out? - I can't. Unbelievable. Good enough to suck, but not good enough to vouch for. That's not it. I know. You won't even come out to my perspective employer. - What kind of lie is that? - I can't. I'm just not ready to tell anyone. The people in my life... I can't. - You said you were trying. - I am. - No, you're not. - I am. Do you know what it takes for me to keep coming back here? I mean, I was taught... I was told to believe things. In spite of those beliefs, I keep coming back here night after night... ...because I care about you. See? I'm trying. Just being here is trying. Police. Tomas Motyashik? You have an open warrant for your arrest. Let's go. Don't worry. Your boyfriend'll lock up. Won't you, officer?
