 Previously on The Shield. Mr. Esteana claims you used excessive force during his arrest. Fourth complaint since I came. You don't like it, take it up with Gilroy. In this building, I'm in charge. Maybe in your own mind, amigo, but in the real world I don't answer to you. Not even on Cinco de Mayo. - What's your take on Mackey? - I don't judge cops. Mackey's not a cop. He's Al Capone with a badge. - I saw Mackey talking to this dealer... - Named Rondell Robinson. You suggesting Mackey's working...

 ...for a dealer? - The dealer's working for Mackey. - Who's he? - Moses Hernandez. He's in Justice. We' re talking about making a case that puts Mack behind bars for a long time. - What are you getting out of this? - A dirty cop off the street. It's all about trust, otherwise you end up dead. Knock, knock, who's there? Strike Team, Mr. Drug Dealer. Terry's losing his cherry tonight. He's coming with us. - 911, what is your emergency? - I've got an officer down! - I'm sorry, could you repeat that? - This is Detective Vic Mack ey. - I've got an officer down... - You have an officer down? The goddamn police radio in the van isn't working... - What is the condition of the officer? - Condition? He's dying! We're... - I have the address. - Where are we? - I don't know... - Ambulance is en route.

 - I'm coming! - Detective. Detective? He was about 10, 15 feet in front of me and Shane when I hear this gunshot... ...and I see Terry go down. Jesus. Shane and I turn around the corner. We see the guy in this bathroom. He gets off a few rounds. We hit back. We should kill the prick. Hey. He's a tough son of a bitch, Terry, all right? He's gonna be okay. What happened? - Terry's down? - Yeah. - How is he? - Took a headshot. Yeah. I didn't clear the room. I was point. First thing you do is clear the room. Look, we both missed him, dude. Surgeons made... Made every attempt to resuscitate him. Shit. Ultimately, their attempts were unsuccessful. Detective Crowley was pronounced dead at 2: 13 this morning. No! Damn. I'm responsible. - I'm responsible. - Responsible how? It was my operation. I called the shots. What could you have done differently? Terry asked me to move him up. - He was part of your team. - He wasn't ready for this. Eight years on the force, a stint in Robbery, two commendations. Sounds like he was ready. - Strike Team's different. - Really? We knock down the doors other cops don't want to. My guys accept the risks because they know I will take care of them. We go out on a mission, I expect every single one of them to come home. Anything else is unacceptable. - What's taking so long? - They' re asking their questions. Yeah, well, how many questions can they have? How would it look if IAD only took five minutes to call this? - They have to be thorough. - Aceveda's gonna shut us down. Look, Aceveda's a water boy. He can't do dick. - Why is it taking them so long? - Look. I answered your question. - No, no... - All right. - Detective Vendrell. - Yeah, that's me. Just tell them what happened. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - What are you doing back here? - Not our crime scene anymore. - IAD gave us a friendly shove. - Why didn't you shove back? Asst. Chief Gilroy gave the order. - Gilroy? He's there? - He was. I don't like spending five hours collecting evidence for someone else. Are we on this case or aren't we? - David. - Sir. Your office? Thanks for your good work this morning, Claudette. Hasn't been wasted. No, just our time. Sir. Where the hell were you last night? - What do you mean? - Detective Crowley got shot. - I left you a message. - Yeah, I got it. - So? - So. - You didn't say I had to come down. - I shouldn't have to. A fellow officer was dying in that hospital. I said a prayer for him. A prayer? What? I've been on the job for three weeks. I didn't know that guy. Rule number one: He was a cop. That means you knew him. - Two deaths, two investigations. - David, please. You can't have your cops investigating your cops. If you clear the Strike Team, that's gonna smack of favouritism. If you actually find something, you' re gonna have a civil war on your hands. Let Internal Affairs do their job. Has anyone sent sympathies to Crowley's family? I spoke to his mother an hour ago. - Someone should speak at the funeral. - Well, perhaps you... No. He was your man. I'm sure you'll represent us well. You were the first one Mackey brought aboard when he assembled the team. We'd worked together. - So there was a comfort level. - Yeah. - Same with the other guys? - Vic knew them too. - Detective Crowley? - No. He was recommended by someone. - I don't recall who. - So Terry was an outsider. No. He was a new guy. But once Vic puts you on the team, then you' re on the team. - Hey. - Hi. Strike Team's getting the third degree? Looks like it. You're assigned the crime scene, right? We' re off it now. Guys are curious. I told them I'd find out what's going on. Any idea? Looks to me like Vic and his cowboys went in undermanned... ...with a half-assed plan and managed to get a guy killed. Then again, I'm off the case. Later, okay? Tell him this is L.A., not the Wild West. I'd know those fingernails anywhere. How you holding up? I lost a guy. I don't like it. - I saw you at the hospital last night. - I saw you too. - You had a crowd. I didn't want to... - It's all right. - I don't want you to think that what... - I don't. Look, if you need a break from all this, you wanna talk, come find me, okay? That's good to know. Anytime someone kills a cop... ...scumbags get it into their heads that it's open season. - Leads to rule number...? - Three: Cop goes down, we re-establish our dominance on the street. Someone mouths off, they hit the pavement. Someone resists, we make sure they make a pit stop at the emergency room. We gotta make sure these assholes know who's in charge, right? Loud and clear. - What happened to your hand? - I put it through a window. - Last night, during the raid? - No, after I found out about Terry. - Is it all right? - Yeah. Cut up pretty bad though, huh? Any tendon damage? Can we just get this the hell over with, please? Mackey sent Terry to that house to get killed. - You don't know that. - Please. Cops get killed in the line of duty. Did you tell anyone Terry was trying to take down Mackey? Did you? - David... - Because I didn't, and Terry's dead. - I followed protocol. - Protocol. The things that Terry wanted, a job, a car, I'm not authorized to sign off on. - You broke the circle. - I sent his request up the ladder. - This is the Justice Department. - So they can be trusted? - I've gotta go to IAD. - Why? To let them know exactly why Mackey wanted Terry dead. You can't do that. They' re gonna let him walk, Moses. If they have motive, they'll dig deeper. David, you initiated an off-the-books investigation into one of your own men. Now, you come forward, your career's dead. We sent Terry to his own death. What am I supposed to do? Well, what do you hope to accomplish? It won't prove that Vic set Terry up. You'll lose the power you've worked your whole life to acquire. I'm not gonna let him get away with it. There is an epitaph for an unknown soldier that goes: Do not stand at my grave and weep For I am not there, I do not sleep With my brothers in the field I kneel Their lives, my merit My death, their zeal I believe these words do express the sentiments of Detective Terry Crowley. A good man and an exemplary police officer... ...who served his community and his department... ...with dignity, loyalty and courage. In the time that I was fortunate to work with Terry... ...I came to know him as a man who embraced life... ...adored his friends and family, and loved being a cop. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, even though he were dead... ...yet shall he live. - Amen. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. We will miss his service and his good nature. And I know I speak on behalf of the entire force when I say: Terry, our lives are your merit... ...and your memory gives us zeal. - He leadeth me beside the still waters. - Yes. He restoreth my soul. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ...I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Fire! Fire! - Sorry... - It's all right now. It's all right. - Sorry, baby! I'm sorry! - It's okay. It'll be all right. Come on. - What are you doing? - What? Save it for the car ride, Shane. What's the matter with you? - I just didn't expect to see his mother. - Yeah. He had a mom. So what? - So, what did we do, Vic? - Hey. What we had to. - Christ. Come on, man. - Enough. Come on. - Cold, man. - Look. We made him one of us and what did he do? - What did he do? - Turned rat. He tried to stick you and me both in a cage with the same animals... ...we fight every day. Now, did I enjoy it? No. Did it need to be done? You' re goddamn right it did. Now, Shane, listen to me. We' re gonna ride this out. Right? I'm so sorry for your loss. - Sir, step back. - No, it's cool. I called you. - Step away, sir. - I need to get the money he owes... Don't make me warn you again, sir. - He's gotta have my cash here. - I'm not gonna warn you again. - I just need to get the money he owes. - What'd she say? - I'm a Good Samaritan here! - What were you doing to that body? Livan said he had the 100 he owed me. I come here and see somebody shot him. I went down the block and call for 911 and come back here to get my money. Jesus, Julien, this guy's still alive. This is One Tango 13. - I need an R.A. To respond. - Hey, Livan! Keep fighting, man. - I'll collect from you later! - Let's go. Shane barely touched his pork chops. I don't think he's doing well. - He's gonna be fine. - He didn't seem fine. Hasn't even been a week yet. I'm coming, sweetie. It's like he blames himself for the whole thing. It's not normal. I mean, it's not like he killed Terry. Here I am, baby. Here's your bottle. It's okay. No, I'm sitting poolside with this guy named Frank. - A transvestite? - He's buying drinks. - That ugly-Iooking guy? - The guy that I always hang out with. He's like 18 years old. You gotta be joking me, man. Come on, you holding out on me, Shane? I got fresh meat. This here's Terry. Comes to us from Robbery. Robbery? You mean like the fag squad, man? We ran out of fresh asses, so I figured I'd try you prom queens on for size. Hey, if you' re looking for fresh asses, I'd cross Shane off your list. Oh, stop it, mister. Stop it. Looks like it's gonna be a blast with you guys. - Just make sure you keep up. - I'll try. Don't let these pussies haze you too bad. Yeah, we love you pretty boys from Robbery. - You know how to play pitch? - You bring your wallet? Don't let them stick you with Shane as a partner. He always loses. - Because you're a bunch of cheaters. - And he's a crybaby. - Shut up, Shane. - Don't trust one of these guys. You know what? He's the worst player in here. Okay, Capt. Fiddly. Let's get you ready for school. Come on. Body was over there. We found one shell casing a few feet away. - How's the victim? - Medic says, swirling down the drain. - Who said that? Randy? - Yeah. - Sounds like Randy, cynical bastard. - Does the rookie ever talk? Yeah, he talks. - What does this tell you? - Ma'am? You' re our first eyes and ears on the crime scene. What does this one tell you? Overturned cart, footprints, clear sign of a struggle. Actually, the struggle occurred after we arrived. A guy was going through his pockets. After repeated requests to stop, I pulled him off the body. Knocking over the churro cart and getting sugar all over our crime scene? Yes, ma'am. Actually, it was my fault. I should've... I hope this isn't the way you teach a trainee how to preserve a crime scene. This is how murderers go free, son. Don't take it hard. She's in a pissy mood because it's her birthday. Did we...? Was this scheduled? No. Frances came by to give me her preliminary report. I wanted you to get a sneak peek at it too. We wrapped up the interviews. I'll fast track ballistics... ...and get you a final copy in the next couple of weeks. Bottom line, it wasn't a model operation, but it wasn't a crime either. Vic and his boys look okay on this one. - Really? - Drug dealer's girlfriend confirms... ...the Strike Team's account. She puts the gun that killed Crowley... ...in the dealer's hands seconds before the shooting. Thanks for the fast work, Frances. She must be good. Two men killed, a dozen rounds fired... ...no ballistics and she's already making her call. It's a preliminary report, David. I just don't want to be accused of whitewashing anything. Last thing this department needs is to add to the Rodney KinglO.J. Book. I don't wanna be a chapter in that book either. I'll make sure she doesn't get lazy on this one, okay? That was a great eulogy, by the way. It was very nice. - Lf my dad dies, it's all my fault. - Why is that? Dad wanted me to go to college around here, live at home. He's a vendor. Doesn't make much money. But I wanted Stanford. I had gotten a scholarship, but it didn't cover everything. There were still books, housing. When he found out, he said if that was my dream... ...he'd make it happen. That's when he stopped paying. - Stopped paying what? - Protection money. This bully in the neighbourhood made all the vendors pay. - My father was unlicensed, so... - So he didn't go to the police. I told him he couldn't stop paying the guy. But he said it was the only way I could go to Stanford. He was so proud when I had gotten in. I begged him to pay the money. But... The thug that did this to my dad, can you guys really get him? - We can try. Who is he? - His name's Marlon Demeral. - Marlon Demeral? - Yeah. So? - You need to come with us. - Thanks, but I think I'll pass. - No, hold... - You can go peacefully or not. - Hey! - Let's go. How about I don't go at all? What's the emergency? - You' re wanted for a shooting. - A Shooting? When? - Today. - Today?! - I didn't shoot nobody. - What are you doing to my boy? - Come on. - Come on, man! Mama, get the camcorder. They' re taking Marlon away. - What is wrong with you? - Stay in the house. - He didn't do anything. - He's my son's father. - I didn't shoot nobody, man. - Right. And who are you to say that? You a brother? Or did you give that up to become one of them? - Look what you' re doing to a brother. - He's not my brother. Let go of my boy. Mama, get the camcorder. They' re taking Marlon. You ain't got nothing to do today? He did... You know what? You ain't nothing but a Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom? That's right. If the Oreo wrapper fits, wear it, brother. - Shut up. - Yeah. Don't go making it black and white. Take a picture. Smile for the camera! Goddamn cops! But I'm like, Where the hell am I supposed to find a dental dam... ...at 2 in the morning? - A dental dam? A rubber you put on your mouth when you go down on a chick. - You serious? - You feel the need to put on a dam... ...I gotta question what your face is doing down there in the first place. She had made a specific request. Sounds like a petri dish with legs to me. I'd think about investing in a couple of syringes of penicillin. So I find this Vietnamese convenience store. And they carried them. Leave it to Charlie to stock the dental dams... ...next to the toothpaste. Are you serious? I rush back, I slap this thing on and I am going to town. I swear, I'm like Gene Simmons on that. I was like the tao of poon. I swear to God. And she's like, I don't feel anything. And you' re like, Really? Because that's my dick. Have you ever tried to use one of these things? I guess you and me dated a different breed of woman. Down and dirty. - No pun intended. - Don't make me hurt you. - What time is lunch around this place? - Shut up. You worked me up an appetite. Tom here could use a bite too. - It's sir to you. - Well, yes, sir. Uncle Tom is looking mighty hungry. Detectives, meet Marlon Demeral. - Pleasure. - Shut up. - Is that the only word you ladies know? - Enjoy. Happy birthday, by the way. - You told her. - No. Yes. By accident. Come with me, Marlon. Whatever you say, birthday girl. So, Lowe, you gonna grab a beer with us tonight? Can't. I got other plans. What's with your partner? Can't spend a little time with his fellow boys in blue? Look, I'm just going to church tonight. God can wait. Tonight, my friend, you get your first B and B. - What's a B and B? - A little tradition we have around here. Nothing like your very first one. Be at the motor pool at the end of the shift. Skip out on us, it's your ass. - Come on, let's get out of here. - What's a B and B? It's stupid and it's juvenile and the sooner you get it over with... ...the sooner you'll be accepted by Jackson and the rest. Why should I care what they think? Rule number seven: Those guys might be overgrown frat boys... ...but someday they could be the only thing between you and a bullet. Look, what y'all got to eat around here? How about a nice churro? - You like churros, Marlon? - Man, that sugary shit is all right. What I'm really jonesing for is a cheeseburger. - Let me see if I can accommodate you. - My man. Oh, come on, sweet thing. Now, I know you got a smile for me underneath all that. Dutch? - Dutch? - Captain. I could use your help with an interrogation. - I'm in the middle of a case. - Well, Claudette's got it under control. All right. That's what all this is about? Look, you could've saved me a trip. Read my lips: I did not kill Poncho, okay? Livan Gonzales. And he's still alive at the moment. Whatever. I didn't shoot nobody this morning. - But I'll turn you on to who did, though. - Will you now? Yeah, but you gotta give me something first. - And what is that? - A cheeseburger. I'm hungry as hell. - Talk first, then you eat. - Come on. All right, all right. Yeah, I had a protection thing going on with those churro chumps. You know? And it was a good gig too. Till last month. This new Mexican gang comes in packing some serious heat. Tells me they moving in on my business. And what gang was this? They call themselves the Los MagnÃ­ficos. See, that's what's wrong with this country. I'm prime example nÃºmero uno. Here I am, trying to make a serious buck... ...and then in comes some wetbacks taking my job. - Your job? - My job. Your job was illegally shaking down churro vendors. Look, a job is a job, lady. Now, I like mine well-done, just like me. With everything. No onions. They give me a rash. I don't find you funny. You looking for me? We'd like to ask you some questions. - About what? - About how Terry died. Oh, are you IAD now? - Seems right up your alley. - I don't feel IAD checked every angle. - Oh, so now you got questions. - I've got a few. What's stopping me from having my PBA rep tell you to blow me? Nothing. If Vic Mackey wants to hide behind a lawyer... ...then that's the way it'll be. You got questions? Fine. Ask your goddamn questions. - Why'd you go in without backup? - A battalion makes a lot of noise. - The element of surprise. - Imagine my surprise when I heard... ...you got a guy killed. Those of us who venture out past our desks sometimes get shot at. Could've brought more firepower without tipping him off. Well, who should I have had watching our backs? You? - I'd hate to have to change your diaper. - Better than burying one of your own. So you fired at the dealer, dealer returned fire, hitting Terry. No. Like I told IAD... ...Two-Time shot Terry, then Shane and I returned fire. - Sounds textbook to me. - Well, that's all we got. Thanks for your time. That's all we've got? Was that supposed to make him confess? No. It's supposed to make him feel safe. Now we go after the weak link in the chain. Who's the weak link? What was that all about? Aceveda's spinning his wheels as usual. Enter. Hey. What can you tell me about a new gang called Los MagnÃ­ficos? Well, they're not so new. They've been clawing their way up for the last six months. Well, I think someone from the gang pulled the trigger on my churro guy. Any bushes you can beat? Looks like we've been invited to the party, ladies. Let's go. Hey, I hear it's your birthday. Happy birthday. - Hang on a second. - I need to ask Shane a few questions. - Me? - I need 10 minutes. I'll send him to catch up with you. I'm cool. I'm gonna grab a Coke first. You need anything? How's the paintbrush, Van Bro? Don't be coming here unless you looking to buy. No more freebies. You want some info, you going to buy something this time. All right. Lem, pick your poison. What do I know about art, man? Ronnie? I kind of like the one with the clouds. - Got a place for it? - Yeah, I guess. All right. How much? Give me 100. And don't be hanging it in no bathroom neither. We' re looking for a Los Mag. Shot up a churro vendor. People say amigo didn't wanna pay his freight. He ignored a couple of warnings. Los Mags sent in a baby banger to do the dirty deed. Earned him his stripes. - Initiation shooting? - Things they got these kids doing... You have to bake a batch of brownies back in your day, Van Bro? Getting in the life was a lot more fun than getting out. Hey, I heard you lost a man a few days back. - Yeah. - Tough times, Vic. I don't know. Maybe someday, somebody will even win in this war. I intend to. - See you around, Vic. - All right, man. Ready for the barrio? The wannabe getting initiated, he's our shooter. I'll take him. Anybody else gets caught in our net, it's gravy. - Are we going in? - No, this punk-ass wants a beating. I say we let him have it. - What's he saying? - Welcome to the life. - You were supposed to be his backup. - We were his backup. - Why is Terry dead then? - Wrong place, wrong time. Aren't you and Vic supposed to be these kick-ass top cops? How does somebody you' re backing up... ...get blown away by some pissant drug dealer? - IAD cleared us. - I didn't clear you. It just went bad, that's all. - You lie. - Notice every time he lies, he squints? - You squint when you lie. - I don't. You' re squinting now. All right, playtime's over. Last one down the hill gets to drink the backwash. All right, we' re a go in three, two, one, go! All right! Police! Stop right there! Freeze! You too! Right there! Right there, hey! Do it now! All right, poquito mas. Squad 111 available. You led Terry there to get killed. - Why would we do that? - You know why. Well, IAD cleared us. Know a drug dealer named Rondell Robinson? No. You' re squinting. You don't know him? I know who he is. I meant, I don't know him personally. If I had a witness that saw you and Vic acting friendly with Rondell Robinson... ...that would be a lie. - That's right. So that witness didn't see the three of you at a car wash. Well, Vic was just putting a scare into him... ...letting him know that we were watching him. - So you lied about that then. - No, I didn't lie about that! Terry knew that you were in bed with Robinson, so Terry had to die. - Terry was a part of our team. - You didn't trust him. - This is bullshit. - You led Terry into that house to die. No, not true. The one guy who disapproved of Vic is the only team member... ...who didn't come out alive? That's a coincidence? Believe what you want. Terry was gonna turn you in, so Vic wanted him dead. - Vic needed him dead! - No! Oh, God. The shot. - That's what the last shot was. - The last shot? Two-Time's girlfriend says in her statement that... ...she heard the last shot 10, 15 seconds after the others. When we approached Two-Time, he moved. - Vic couldn't leave it to chance. - Vic fired once more. - That's the shot that killed Terry. - No way. - Vic fired that shot, didn't he? - No. Stop squinting! I know. I know. You' re wrong. I want Mackey. You don't have to go down with him. - That is not how it happened. - Stop lying to me. I know what happened. I have a witness, Shane. He connects you and Vic with Rondell Robinson. I have a witness. Give me Vic and your problems end. Just give me Mackey. What the hell's going on? You've had him here for two hours? - He's making up sick shit about us, Vic. - Go downstairs and wait for me. - This whole thing is a joke. - Grab a sandwich, Dutchboy. I know what you did. Up until now, I've tolerated you. You come near my men again, I'm gonna lose patience. You listening? I know. The churro guy you shot's in surgery. Doctors don't know if he'll live. The churro guy you shot's in surgery. Doctors don't know if he'll live. Tell her you didn't shoot this man. Tell me who put you up to this, I'll see if I can get you placed in juvie court. If you wait and he dies though, you'll be tried for murder as an adult. Olman, please tell her you didn't do this. - Of course I didn't do it. - You see? I shoot someone, he don't almost end up dead. Bitch ends up all dead. That's your alibi? If you'd have shot him, he'd be dead? Hell, yeah, that's my alibi. Guess what. - Churro guy's actually gonna make it. - Good. You won't believe what just went down between Aceveda and Mackey. - I don't wanna know. - Yeah. No. But this is... Anyone gets between those two is just gonna end up... ...with a hose full of piss running down his leg. Good news and bad news. Bad news is... ...the churro vendor just died. Good news for your son. Someone else is taking credit for the killing. Thank you, Jesus. Yeah. Some guy named Marlon walked in off the street, said... ...your gang was trying to muscle in on his business, so he decided to show... ...the vendors your gang couldn't protect him. - Marlon didn't do no shooting. - He did. Everyone is talking about how he showed your boys up. The old man stopped paying us. That's my shooting. - He's just looking to piggyback a rep. - Olman, no. So you' re trying to take credit for what happened now? I told you if I shot him he'd be dead, right? People need to know. Los Mags own these streets. - Who asked you to do the shooting? - I ain't never telling you that. These are my brothers now. Do you know what this means, Olman? - Means I earned my way in. - No. It means you' re going to jail. At least I' II have family there. Tell me you didn't reopen an investigation that wasn't yours. There were unanswered questions. You accused Vic Mackey of working with a dealer. Who's your witness? - Anonymous tip. - Anyone who can corroborate it? Is there something you know that explains why you' re still pursuing this? Well? No. Then it ends here. Christ, David. You' re doing a good job. The chief said so the other day. Don't lose focus now. I won't. Good. Thanks for getting Capt. Ass Invader off my back. It wouldn't kill you to show him more respect. Come on. Hey, Vic. The men here take their cues from you. I'm just saying dial it down. I don't do my best work with him nipping at my heels. - Which is why I'm watching out for you. - Good. Question is, are you watching out for me? Meaning? My guys tipped you off that Terry was looking to take you down. The bust just went bad. My source at Justice is all over my ass. He wants to know if... ...you made us all accomplices to a murder. I told him you'd never, never do that to me. Would you? Terry got overeager. He got himself killed. - End of story? - End of story. It better be. Is this from you? No. I know how you feel about birthdays. Denture cream. Thank you. Tells you I'm getting old. I don't see a card. Anyone wanna take credit for this? - Not me. - I didn't think so. - How's the birthday girl doing? - Don't say that word. - I came to take you dancing. - I don't wanna go dancing. We gotta do something, honey. It's your birthday. - So? - So it's ladies' night at the Crimson. I have it on very good authority that Franklin Green's gonna be there. - His divorce final? - Two weeks ago. Well, I can't let Franklin Green see me looking like this.
