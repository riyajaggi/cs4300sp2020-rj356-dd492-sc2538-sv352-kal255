 Previously on The Shield: Hooker? Facedown like the other four? - I warned you. - You did. The guy who murdered Sally's still out there! We'll get your guy too. Just won't be today. - I'm not gay. - Julien. Come on. It's this thing inside of me. I push it down, it goes away. But then it comes back stronger. I hate this thing inside of me. You can't go through life hating who you are. I pushed away everyone. My partner, my reverend, Tomas.

 I'm alone. - Jesus Christ! What happened? - I thought that he was gonna kill me! - Well that story's not gonna cut it. - I'll lose my son. All right, you had sex. You asked him to pay. He said he didn't have to. He was gonna make you pay. - Your friends, they'll believe that? - Lf you have the bruises to prove it. Hit me. - So how am I doing? - I got no complaints. You wanna go someplace more private? I thought this was as private as it got in here. - I mean outside. - That sounds promising. We gotta hurry up. I don't want my boss to catch me. - How do I know you're not a cop? - lf I were a cop, would I do this? - That's nice. - Is he doing what I think he's doing?

 No way. How are we supposed to know when these muggers jump him? - We gotta go in. - And ruin a good thing? He'd kill us. - Jesus. Just lost my appetite. - I told you I saw something. Sir! You wanna stop jerking off there? Get your hands out of your pants and put them up! - All right, all right! - Against the wall. Move it. - I can explain. I can... - Move it! Up against the wall! Get his wallet. - Turn around. - Long way from Pasadena. Alleys not good enough for you there? This is the stupidest thing I've ever done. - Well, we call it a lewd act in public. - Oh, God. I guess she wasn't one of the girls involved with the mugging ring. Oh, you dog. You nailed her, didn't you? - Yeah, like I'd tell you three. - Oh, no, he was deep undercover. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. Whoa! Calm down, Connie. What's the matter? All right, hold on. Listen, I gotta run. Wait a half-hour and then send the next guy in. Rotate until one of you guys gets attacked. - Or gets a little tail. - All right. Where are you now? Oh, God. - I'm sorry. - Oh, Christ. Connie, what happened? She was my mom. - So tell me, Ronnie. - He used his own name? - Amateur. - Like, what kind of stuff you into? You know, golf. I'm a 4 handicap. Is he looking to caddie or get his junk greased? Sit right here and relax. - You like this, Ronnie? - Yeah. - Yeah? - But could you, like, just... - ... kind of tease me? - Tease? Not really take it off, but, like, almost and then not. - Oh, okay. - What, is he for real? All right, that's it, I'm going in. That's it. Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie. What are you gonna do about him, Connie? - I'll feed him. - I mean... ...without your mom, who's gonna take care of Brian? - I can take care of him. - You need help. I'll get clean. I won't need help. - You can barely take care of yourself. - No. - Connie... - Please! They can't take Brian. He's all I got left. My mom... God, Vic. My mommy's dead. Help me, Vic. - You can get me through it. - Connie, you need to go somewhere. Rehab, a treatment centre. The DA's still looking at my plea. I'll go into detox, and they'll use that. I'll lose Brian, and they'll take my aid! Okay? It's been, like, 1 2 hours since I chased. - Tonight and tomorrow will be worse. - Connie. I'm gonna get straight this time. I have to. I'm his mom. Yeah, leave that to me. - Reporter? - From La Unidad. Didn't you know? Our captain is a Latino to watch. How about a story about a lanky white guy to watch? Since your arrival, there have been major drops in all areas of crime. This precinct was an experiment. But those stats aren't a coincidence. The Barn is a success. - The Barn? - Farmington's called the Farm. When we moved into the old church... ...one of the officers nicknamed the place the Barn. Name stuck. It's ironic. Taking over a church. - God moved out, the cops moved in. - God's still here. We just sublet. Mind if I talk to some of your people? - Get some background? - Of course not. Good night for Aceveda to have a sex-sweep, huh? Yeah. We busted a one-armed hooker. Fifty bucks, she'll let you hump her in her socket. Julien and I were in Koreatown, caught this guy masturbating in the alley. Wasn't even homeless. Just a regular Joe from Pasadena. This guy, you remember what alley he was in? Yeah. The one between Sixth and Wentworth. Next to the Laundromat that keeps getting hit. You sure? Positive. He's not horning in on your territory is he, detective? What was this guy's name? You remember? - His name? - Yeah. It was on the ticket, right? - We didn't give him one. - He was a citizen. We just... ...gave him a warning. Put the scare in him. Try and remember. What was it? - Sean, I think. - Taylor. - Sean Taylor. - Yeah, that's it. - What was that about? - Who knows? It's Dutch. If you put yourself or this kid in harm's way, DCFS isn't gonna take him. I am. You understand? I promise, Vic. I promise. Okay. You should drink a lot of fluids. Water, juice. - Your mom got any bananas? - I don't know. - One of my guys is gonna sit with you. - Where will you be? - I'm gonna take Brian away. - No. Trust me. You won't want him to see this. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of him. I love him. - I really love him. - I know you do. - You are so hot. - Yes, I am. Am I turning you on? Well, that's nine inches of yes, isn't it, darling? Feels more like 1 0. You know, I don't usually do this... ...but do you want to go out back and finish this off? All I got is time and money. - What? I was doing good. - "I'm a 4 handicap"? I was laying the groundwork. You're killing me, baby. Oh, let me take this thing off. - Let me take this off you right now. - He shoots, he scores. - Shit! Shane. Go, go, go! - Jesus! - Freeze! Police! - Back up! Get them up! Against the wall! - Hands behind your head! - Get on your knees! - Get on your knees! - Turn around. Get on your knees! Shane, are you all right? Shane! Can you say anything? Yes. Danny. - Is this the guy you caught jerking off? - No! I can't go in there. No! - Yeah. - Thanks. No! No! - No, I'm not going in there! - There you go. No! No, I'm not going in there! You should have thought about that before you solicited a cop. Hey! Get off! Get him off! He's biting! Damn it! Get him off! Goddamn it! Oh, shit! Get him off! - Stay down! Stay down! - Move! - You okay? - Gotta get to the hospital. - Have them put me on PEP. - PEP? Post-exposure prevention, in case the guy's... ...got HIV. - You think he does? You saw the guy. I was so close to her. That prick had to come and break it up. - Dude, let it go, man. - I'm telling you. It wasn't just an act. - She really felt something. - That roll of 20s. I'm serious. She was rubbing her ass all over my hands. They don't just do that for everyone. I got a friend who lives in Chicago. You from there? - Yeah. Rockford. - Is that like a suburb? No. It's its own town. What are you doing here, detective? - You should've got a ticket. - Okay. - What you did is a misdemeanor. - Well... ...nobody's more embarrassed about it than I am. Hey, we all do it. You just got caught. This any good? That depends on what you're looking for, detective. What about the radio? One in my car only... ...picks up Spanish stations. - That's not your system. That's L.A. Well, I guess I'm done here. - Okay, that's it? - That's it. Some husbands just bring home flowers. Yeah. I didn't have time to wrap him up. - Who is this? - It's Brian. Connie's kid. - Connie? - This hooker. It's a long story. You brought a prostitute's child home? Why are you doing this? Connie's mother died. A stroke. - I'm sorry, but that's no... - She's trying to kick her habit... ...so they won't take him away. - You expect me to watch him? It's just for one night. Look, I'm sorry. You're the only one I trust him with. It's okay. I hate you. I love you too, but I gotta go. Officer, would you see her to her car, please? Thank you. - Who's the woman? - Nobody. You'd think interviewing so many liars would make you a better one. - What? - We all know you're following up... ...on the self-pleasurer. The guys started a pool to see who could come up with the best joke. - I think he's our serial killer. - Dutch. - He killed Sally and the others. - Got anything this time... ...other than intuition? Like evidence? - That woman. That's his aunt. She raised him after his parents died. His early childhood fits the profile. - Shy, introverted, a loner. - You're getting colder, not hotter. Caught masturbating two blocks from the corner where Sally worked. Still cold. You never established Sally was killed in that alley. It's the classic opportunity offender m.o. They only kill when presented with the perfect victim at the perfect time. - And if the opportunity is not perfect? - Plan B. Relive the fantasy at the scene of an earlier crime. - It's getting chilly. - Think about it. The guy has an apartment in Pasadena, has complete privacy there. Why is he traveling to one of the worst parts of town to jerk off in an alley? - You okay? - I gotta get out. - I gotta... - No. Hey, just lay down. Just relax. Just relax. It's okay. Relax. - Jesus Christ. - Connie! She hit me! Okay. Okay. All right. I'm here. - Okay, okay. - Vic. - Vic? - Here. Try to drink something. It's water. Come on. Drink. Okay, good girl. Okay. - I love you, Vic. - Yeah. Rest. Okay. Okay, Connie. Come on. Rest. - I love you, Vic. - Yeah. Rest now. Rest. - Is your head okay? - No. It hurts. I'm sorry about that, you know. I didn't know you were a cop. - That was the idea. - I wanted Carl to stop hitting you... ...because I think you're real cute. Sexy. - Southern, right? - Atlanta, thereabouts. Hot-lanta. Yeah. So tell me about Carl. He introduced me to the guy who owns the club... ...and that's when I started, you know. - Stripping. Dancing. I'm a dancer. - Sorry. - Then this one night... ...Carl comes to me with this, like, "relevation," asks for my help. And, you know, he was getting me my medicine... ...so I kind of felt like I owed him. I'm epileptic. Puts you in a tough spot, huh? I knew it was wrong, but he was such a sweet guy. He hit me in the head with a tire iron. Yeah, except for that. Why are you guys harassing me? - My aunt? - We just asked her a few questions. - She's a nice lady. - Yes. - Told us about the fire. - What fire? The one your parents died in when you were a kid. I give your aunt a lot of credit. It couldn't have been easy raising... ...a child under those circumstances. - I owe her everything. You deserve a pat on the back yourself. Why? Well, to be able to lift yourself above something like that... ...excel in the face of tragedy, speaks volumes about your character. - I did the best I could. - I'd say. Magna cum laude. Top 1 0 in your graduating class. Turned down a full ride to law school. - Who wants to be a lawyer, right? - I hear you. But it does bring up an interesting question. For a guy with such impressive brain power... ...why install car stereos for a living? Look. I jerked off in an alley. Okay? I'm embarrassed. Now just write me a ticket and let's be done with this. You like to hunt, Sean? - Do I like to hunt? - Mike Joyce. - Your friend in high school. - How do you know about Mike? Talked to a detective back in Rockford. Two boys go into the woods deer hunting. Only one comes back alive. - It was an accident. - Maybe. Or maybe something happened in those woods. Or maybe you just have a very active imagination. An intelligent, but underachieving loner. I wonder how you give your imagination a workout. I know what you're trying to get at. And frankly, this whole psychoanalyzation thing... ...it just seems a bit out of your league. - Just trying to get to know you better. - Please. I know more about you than you know about me. - Really? - He's innocent or doesn't scare easily. He's the guy. Well, we better find something fast, because we can't hold him. Hey, Dutch. Heard you've been interviewing the masturbator. What are you doing, getting tips? Goddamn it! I wanna go home! Connie. Connie. You are home, honey. I wanna die. I wanna die! - Connie. Connie! Connie! - Vic. That's right, sweetheart. It's me. It's okay. I'm here. Okay, I'm here. - I'm here. That's right. - We had sex. I told him it was time to pay. He said he didn't have to pay. That's when he started hitting me. - Man, Connie. - He pulled out a gun! - I took it and I shot him! - What's she saying? You have to hit me. Hit me! Come on! - Connie. Connie. - Please, Vic. Please. I wanna die. I wanna die. - No. - Yeah. No, no, you don't. No, you don't. - Detective Wyms. Tereza Varela. - Yes, I know. Have a minute? People say you're the one to talk to. - About what? - I'm doing a piece on your captain... ...and I wanted to ask you questions. - Such as? His effectiveness, people skills, relationships. He's very effective, seems to do fine with people... ...and his relationship is, he's my boss. A very good one. He skipped a few steps in his rise to captain. More desk than street time. - People resent that? - I don't. One big happy family, huh? I don't know any family that doesn't have the occasional disagreement. Neither do I. You're talking about the Strike Team. Am I? Well, my sources confirm numerous complaints of excessive force... ...lAD investigations, civil suits... - I don't know. I don't have your sources. - Carl totally rolled on Tulips. - And Tulips totally rolled on Carl. He's a Svengali who got the dancers to go in on his little bait-and-bash game. Carl says Tulips organized it. She set up the muggings. - She's a hottie, not Amy Fisher. - Bottom line, who's the ringleader? - Her. - Him. This is the easiest case we've had all year. Do I have to get involved? - No. - Then get to the bottom of it. Or nail both of them for kicking Shane's ass. I didn't get my ass kicked. I got sucker-punched. Right. Sorry. Hey, what'd the doctor say? Until Aceveda subpoenas the prom queen's medical records, I take pills... ...get a blood test every 30 days. - I'm sorry. I took my eyes off him. It happened so fast. I hit him and his blood got in your cut. If he's HIV... Look, Julien, it's not like we shared needles. I screwed up, though. I should have played this smarter. Well, it's just a bite, you know? Drug kit I'm on, I got no worries. Hey. I heard what happened. You okay? Just a couple scratches. No big deal. You let loose pretty good on that queer last night. Yeah. You did the right thing, Julien. That prick jumped you. We need to send a message. - What kind of message? - Blanket party. No, thanks. All right? It's in the past. You change your mind, you let us know. What's a blanket party? Somebody likes to draw. "Detective Wagenbach. Craves respect. Fantasizes about being well-liked... ...yet shows no outward manifestation of his low self-esteem. Feels ignored, unappreciated. Inadequate with women." It's just off some first impressions, but I'll stand by it. Maybe you'd like to read my palms too. Look at him. Tell me I'm wrong. It's why you became a cop. You thought by having a gun and badge they'd respect you. They do. Even in a uniform, you were still a joke. That's why you became a detective. - Tell me more. - Dutch. It's all right. You're the same lonely kid from high school. When you look in the mirror, you don't see the person you wish you were. Just a lowly civil servant that you hoped you'd never become. - I hope you're here to pick him up. - Not yet. - What are you doing? - I'm bringing some things to Connie. Is that where you were all night? Me and Ronnie are helping her. She puked on her clothes. It's ugly. - How about me? It's ugly here too. - I'm sorry. - Take this crack whore to detox. - I can't. She'll lose him if I do. - What the hell's going on, Vic? - What're you talking about? - I'm not stupid. What is it with her? - Nothing. - Are you sleeping with her? - Jesus. The kids. Oh, God. - Is this your son? - Stop it. Tell me! I pulled her out of a brawl two years ago. These Thai-towners were kicking the shit out of her for stealing johns. I gave her my number. I told her to call me if she needed help. She did. Cracked out on the floor of a hotel bathroom. Six months pregnant, screaming, crying, begging for forgiveness. I show up and find her in a pool of bloody crystals. She tried to get rid of him with some Drano and a plunger handle. I rushed them to Mission Cross. They did an emergency C-section. Ten weeks premature. Jonesing at birth. He's a tough kid. - I have some old dresses in the garage. - Thank you. We got a problem. Carl says you organized the muggings. - What? - Says he was just the muscle... ...that you were the brains. - You don't believe him, do you? No, of course not. But who knows how a jury would see it. So, what can I do? Is there anything that you can give me to prove Carl's guilt? - I don't know. - You gotta work with me here. - Victim's names, dates. - He set it up. I just did what he asked. There's only one deal to be made here. And I'd really like to see you get it. I want it. There's gotta be something I can put on the table. Right? - I want you to explain yourself. - What's to explain? - Why'd you bite my partner? - To give her what I got. - You can't pass HIV through biting. - Aren't you the expert? - So you were trying to kill her? - I got it in jail. Cops put me in jail, so why shouldn't I give it to cops? Look at you. You're the reason why people hate faggots. Wanna give me a big kiss, lover? I should have bitten both of you. - Where is it you're from again? - La Unidad. - So, what is this room? - Observation. Victims and witnesses can safely identify suspects. And we get to monitor interrogation techniques. About three years. - I have less free time than you'd think. - That's right. You're... "The harm on the Farm." That's what people call the policing tactics in Farmington. Isn't it? That's just PR. Never hurts to have the bad guys a little nervous. I'd say they're more than nervous. The complaints suggest brutality. Really? Does your captain encourage that type of law enforcement? I need my detective. - Who's that? - What did you tell her? - Me? She's the one looking for dirt. - So she goes where it's dirty? Hey. You and I don't like each other. That's not a new headline. - No, it's not. - But one thing you know... ...if I come after you, it'll be straight on. This one, cut your hands off and smile as she asks you to clap louder. If she keeps digging, no one is gonna be happy. Agreed. So how do we shut her down? - I heard Danny went home early. - The medicine makes her nauseous. - Hope she doesn't end up like Watson. - Knock wood. - Who's Watson? - Got stuck with a needle. - No one mentioned him before. - What do you expect? A cop gets shot in the line of duty and it's all twenty-one gun salutes. Some queer in a dress gives you AIDS... ...you end up unemployed and the city's dirty secret. The guy who bit her couldn't care less. Just because Danny doesn't want to give him a blanket party... ...doesn't mean this fairy doesn't deserve one. Count me in. - Last cage on the right. Let's go. - How's the case coming? Sweet. Cut a deal with Tulips to testify against Carl. Roped in the other girls who were in on it. Consider the mugging book closed. Hey, I was doing a little channel-surfing up in observation. I didn't know we got the Spice Network. - You saw that. - Yeah, I better not see any repeats. Hey, I talked to the girlies. They all say the same thing. - Tulips was behind the whole thing. - What? Yeah. Carl was just, like, her sexual pawn she totally manipulated. Imagine that. Tulips. Tulips. So when am I getting out of here? I'm not too sure, darling. See, your dancer friends and Carl... ...they have a different hit on who's calling the shots in your little scam. You. - So, what are you saying? - With their testimony... ...two years is the best I can get for you. I'm sorry. How much time are you getting for sexual misconduct? - Pardon me? - I got a yammy full of Georgia joy juice. Enough DNA to have you writing parking tickets in Pacoima. So am I walking out of here... ...or do we need to call your supervisor? - Do I look okay? - Beautiful. I'm feeling a little dizzy. Would you like something to drink? - Yeah. - You should lay down. - Okay. Can you get me some tea first? - Sure. I'm tired of talking about my parents. Let's talk about you. Now how does your father feel about the way that your life's turned out? He's proud of me. Sure. That's what he says to your face. - Oh, man. - Hey, guys. Come here. - You gotta check this out. - What's up? - Dutch is getting hammered by a civvie. - It's brutal. It's like watching a train wreck. Only it's more horrific. Whatever you're after, put it on the table. Okay. Tell me about increased allegations of brutality. We're a proactive force. Bad guys don't like to be arrested. Allegations are all they are. So you're not promoting use of force... ...to inflate your impressive crime statistics. - Please. - Listen... ...he's the top cop in this building. He gets results, but not at the expense of the law. He deserves a lot of credit. What about your alleged rape of a 2 1 -year-old white girl? - What? - Would you like to take credit for that? Vic, give us a minute. - What are you doing? - A captain... ...with a history of violence commands the district... ...with the highest percentage of brutality complaints. Now he wants to be on the city council. That was 1 5 years ago. Hospital records show... ...Maureen Wilmore had signs of bruising and burns. I'm not gonna discuss this. I have a wife and daughter. How would you feel if their rapist wanted to be their representative? There's not a story here. I'll take that as a "no comment." Truth is, I may not have been a popular guy in school, but I got laid. More than a few times. I'm getting laid now too. And guess what? She's hot. - Pathetic. - Oh, man. - What's going on? - Sherlock Holmes is getting smoked. Truth is, I just like to solve puzzles. I would've told you earlier, but I needed time to do a few things. Now, here's what I know about you: You're perceptive. You can sense when people are vulnerable. You have access to other people's cars. That way, they can't be traced back to you. Meticulous. There wasn't a speck of dust in your shop. Because in your business, you can't make any mistakes. Did you put a Sony CD player into a green Ford Taurus five weeks ago? I don't know. I work on a lot of cars. Customer said you returned it with a broken taillight. Now that does sound vaguely familiar there. - You remember Sally, Sean? - Should I, Dutch? Oh, my God. Someone stop it. - I wanna leave. - You had the chance to leave earlier. Instead you decided to stick around and show off. - The judge issued a search warrant. - For what? - He gave us the keys to your place. - You're not gonna find anything there. Just the standard collection of bondage-domination porn. Which is why we also got a search warrant for your aunt's house. - You can't do that. - You co-signed the mortgage. We can. I thought this guy was eating Dutch for lunch. Here. Let me draw you a picture, Sean. This... ...is your aunt's house. This is the porch. And this... This is the crawl space... ...the Pasadena P.D. Just dug two bodies out of. How many more are we gonna find, Sean? Five? Ten? - Seventeen. - Seventeen? Jesus Christ. That's just under the crawl space, you know? The other ones I dumped. I ran out of room under my aunt's house. - It's pathetic. - What is? How typical you are. Soon as you're caught, you try to be special. I killed 22 people. Twenty-three, if you wanna count the hunting accident back in Rockford. Oh, I'm special, all right. If you're so special... ...how come a lowly civil servant like me just caught you? - Yeah! - Yeah, Dutch. - Great job, man. - Thanks. Thanks. - Hey, Dutch. - Yeah? - Told you we'd get this guy. - Yes, you did. I thought I was gonna have to do all the work. Right. Good job. Thanks. Looks like you're quite the celebrity. - It's right over here. - All right. I'm so sure I am. Way to go, Ron Jeremy. Simple investigation and you cage everyone except the evil stripper. We got the guy who hit me. And she's a dancer. Right. You think she'll have trouble finding another loser with a tire iron? So everyone else here is free to bang away. - Lem here is nailing Chiquita Banana. - Hey. - You know what I'm saying. - I'm tired of you saying it. Oh, so once again, I'm the asshole. Just leave Tigre out of this, all right? I dig her. This whole West Side Story thing's got a life span of two weeks, tops. What? - Where's Connie? - Gone. Oh, shit. You're my wife. I don't wanna keep anything from you. - Who is this woman? - Maureen was a girlfriend... ...at USC. Her father is Chester Wilmore. - The publisher? - Yeah. Maureen, she liked to play rough. Pleasure-pain kind of thing. It was... Just tell me, David. One night we were drinking, and she asked me to tie her up. I did. Pour hot wax on her stomach. I did. She wanted me to choke her to heighten the... I couldn't. It was too much. The next day, I broke up with her, and she got pissed off. Obsessed. One night, she tracked me down, and we got in this huge fight. She grabbed my roommate's pocket-knife. - I didn't get this scar rock climbing. - Jesus. When that didn't get my attention, she filed charges... ...and got Daddy's lawyers involved. What kind of charges? Sexual battery. Attempted rape. - It was a long time ago. - My God, David. If Varela prints the story, who knows what the public will believe. You wanna fight it? Babe, you just say the word... ...and I will step away from all of this. Let the bitch come after you. Are you okay? Perfect. Sorry. - I tried. - I know. Come here. - Well, is he okay? - Yeah. Yeah, he's good. Good. Good. Look... ...I just wanted to be sure. - You need help. - I can't be helped. He can. He's a good boy, Vic. - Someone will love him. - He's your boy. A happy white baby. Couples will be fighting over him. He needs his mother. That's just not me. There you go. - No! No! No! - Come on, come on, man. - No! No! - She's your partner, man. - Come on! - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! - All right. Julien! - That's enough, dude! You'll kill him! - Shut him up! - Come on. All right. Dutchster, great job.
