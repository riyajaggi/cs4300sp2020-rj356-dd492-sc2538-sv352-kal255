 - Mommy got a vacuum! - Kids! - Mommy got a vacuum! - Hey, Jack? Aren't you glad you gave up that silly philosophy book so we could just settle down in Toledo? Best decision of my life. Yeah. Another kid! - Oh! - Your best friend is here to take you to work. Hey, hey, there he is! Oh, no! We both wore the ties we bought together. Again. Ah! Ah! Ah!

 Oh! Oh, God! Oof. ♪ A.P. Bio 2x13 ♪ Kinda Sorta Oh, God, it was... it was awful. I had... I had so many fat Toledo babies, and I was teacher of the year. Yuck, that nightmare was a horrifying reminder that I need to stay laser-focused on my plan to get out of Toledo. It's like I've been on an escalator, you know? And if I'm not careful I'm gonna get my shoelaces caught in that escalator. It's gonna pull me in and it's gonna grind me into a pulp. Sarika, why the hell are you so happy? The Whitlock college fair is this week and the Harvard admissions officer will be there. Do colleges have communal showers? I'm scared guys will make fun of my flat butt. I did my research, and if the Harvard recruiter flags my application I have a 17% better chance of being accepted. Which should be no problem with your help. Hard pass, Sarika. - Come on, you know that. - Heather? If you can get Sarika into Harvard, she'll give your shiny new manuscript to her aunt, who just so happens to be one of Dean Koontz's publishers. Yes, you heard me right. Dean Mother Koontz. I punched it up a little bit. I'm sorry, Sarika, why am I just now hearing about this powerful aunt? Because you've never had anything I've wanted this much before. - And why have Heather read it? - She's your favorite. It wouldn't have worked if it was Marcus or Caleb. I'm the second worst after Marcus? Uh-huh. Good. This is good. This is good. Getting my book published is exactly what I need to get the hell out of Toledo. Guys, we're gonna help Sarika get into Harvard. A fruit smoothie for lunch, Stef? So cool. Feel like I'm eating next to a fancy Hollywood celebrity with body dysmorphia. Uh, this is straight-up cough syrup. I woke up with a tickle in my throat this morning and I cannot be sick for the college fair. Ooh, someone's Navy recruiter boy toy is coming in again this year. Yes, every year we have a whirlwind romance and he cleans my house. Ooh, I see. "Cleans my house" is like a sex term. Well, then I should tell you that last night my husband, Keith, Swiffered the dust under the couch for the first time in ten years. No, Michelle, I mean literally. He literally cleans my house, okay? He's such a disciplined military man that he wakes up so early he just can't help himself but get up and start cleaning, and if he knows I'm sick, he will not come over and start cleaning. That's what I meant. Our house is dirty too. He's like a strong, sexy Mary Poppins. Ooh, yes, Admiral Poppins. I'll salute you. Ooh, careful, Michelle, you just durbed. I'm... I'm sorry, did you just say, uh, "durbed"? Yeah, as in "durbing". You know, when the stuff glops out of a sandwich. But that's my... my name. - I'm Durbin. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly. We named it after you three years ago when one of your meatball subs blasted out onto your shirt. You've been saying this for three years? Whoop, careful, Michelle. You're durbing. Oh. But... J-Jack knows this too? Well, don't be offended. Excuse me, I'll go eat this out in the hall. - Wh... - Oh. Hey, ladies, um, I just wanted to give you a chance to drink this up, okay? 'Cause it might be your last chance. - Pass. - Uh, nope. - Return it. - Okay, yeah, chuckle it up. But it looks like my book might be getting published, which puts me on the next train out of this miserable dump. Aww, come on, Jack. You know you don't mean that. Trust me, ladies, there is nothing in this town - I'll miss, okay? - Okay. Well, he clearly hasn't been to the Toledo Zoo. Aww. Girl, he would definitely miss you. Oh, it's fine. It's totally fine. It's just... it's... I was at the zoo when a panda gave birth. Yep, I saw a little baby panda durb right out of the mama. Aww. I can't believe this is working. My, oh my, oh my, aren't we boisterous this morning? Gonna need some extra shutting-up today. All right, guys, let's focus on getting Sarika into Harvard and getting me the hell out of Toledo holding two sacks of that sweet, sweet Koontz cash, right? Now, these days, good grades aren't enough to get into Harvard, so we're gonna have to trick this recruiter into thinking Sarika has what she lacks most: charm and personality. Sarika, pop up. Go to the back. Face me, I want to show you something. Now, you need to make a really good first impression, and that starts the moment that the recruiter sees you. So I'm the recruiter. Show me your approach, come on. This is what I'm talking about. So rigid, so closed off, you know? No. No, no, no, no. Can somebody in this room please show Sarika how to walk with confidence? Marissa? That was confident. Here we go. Okay, Victor, don't overthink it. It's just like breathing. Oh, okay, I'm thinking about my breathing. Oh, God. Why did you volunteer for this? It's not your thing. Yes, this guy gets it. All right, keep going, keep going. You guys seeing this? All right, now make a left. Just go all the way down the hall. All the way down? 'Sup, mama? What up, big dog? How you doing? Dan Decker. Honored to meet you, sir. Yes, well, good... yes. Welcome to Harvard. Wow. Wow. Sarika, did you see that? Now, these recruiters, they also love humility, so why don't you start with a self-deprecating joke. Guys, what can Sarika say to criticize herself? - She's a kiss-ass. - Bad clothes. - She's rude. - Yes, good. Yes. Okay, we have... we have a lot of good options here. All right, yeah, now, did... did somebody say she's rude? - That was me. - She is rude, you're right. This is going good, Sarika, trust me. What else, guys? _ Well, hello, Admiral. Stef. Oh, I can't wait to see you later. Can't wait either. You okay? Your voice is a little raspy. Oh, I been smoking. Huh. I read a study that says that that can be dangerous. You been on that boat too long. I'll see you later. - "Oberland". - It's Oberlin. I always wished I'd gone to college. I know I'm not the traditional college applicant, but I am the perfect one. Why not? Here's a pamphlet. A pamphlet? It looks like Helen Henry DeMarcus is going to college! Okay, so remember what we talked about, all right? I'm gonna say, "This is Sarika Sarkar. "She is our best student, a unique talent, and an even better human." Then you hit them with... Oh, he's just saying that 'cause teacher evaluations are this week. Yes, then we laugh for exactly two seconds... Then you crush some small talk, your app goes in the priority folder, and my manuscript gasses it straight to Koontzville. - Ready? - Yeah. All right. Well, if it isn't Nasty Jack Griffin. Kate. - Bring it in, Nasty Jack. - Okay. Oh, you smell good. Oh, well, um, I gotta go, but it was great to see you. And, uh, great seeing you, Sarika. Yeah, I... yep. He's just saying that 'cause teacher evaluations are this week. - What the hell? - Uh, yeah, sorry about that. Turns out I have a little bit of a sexual history with that particular recruiter. Yeah, she and I used to hook up all the time at Harvard. It's a little awkward now, though, 'cause I'm kinda-sorta into somebody else a little, you know? That's not something you guys need to know about. - Lynette. - We know. The beautiful, beautiful payroll lady. - Knock, knock. - Hey. I, uh, just wanted to let you know we're headed to our hotel bar. - Oh. - You should pop by. It'll be like old times. I might even... Uh, that'd be... that'd be interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah. Bye. So they really do whisper dirty things. Looks like you have a second chance. If you can get this in her priority folder. the deal is back on. Uh, I don't think so, Sarika. Are you really gonna ruin your chances at publishing your book because of Lynette? A woman you kinda-sorta like? You're gonna be stuck in Toledo. Forever. Fine, give me the application, all right? I'll go do a little harmless flirting. But there will be no tequila and no banging. Do you hear me, Sarika? I will not bang that woman for you. Okay. Trick is, I take my right hand, and then I firmly shove it under the starboard edge of the mattress. Ooh, mama, I need those tight corners. Oh, hello, everyone. Okay. A durb, a durb. Ladies and gentleman, you have all been durbed. No, you cannot force a new durb, Ralph. Durbing is slop glopping. God, can't durbing mean anything else? - It's so gross. - Oh, my God. Okay, if it bothers you so much, we'll just let the universe decide. Okay, so the next random, unnamed thing that happens will be durbing. Yes. All right. Thank you. I'm like, "If you have to ask, you can't afford college" Hey, hey. - Hey. - How we doing, Kate? You enjoying Toledo's finest hotel? Did you get the parking lot view or the mall's air conditioning view? Mall's air conditioning view. - It is stunning. - Ooh. Aren't we fancy? Look at you. Hey, so, um, I wanted to talk to you about a student of mine. After we have some tequila. Uh, yeah, I was afraid of that. Um, I'm actually sticking to club soda tonight. Oh. Okay. Suit yourself. Wow, your skin's so hot to the touch. - Are you okay? - Yes. Yes. No, I am very sick, and I was hiding it from you 'cause I didn't want to ruin our precious two days together. Stef, we're both human beings. We have to accept each other's flaws and weaknesses. To be honest, I feel like I might be coming down with... False alarm. He just sneezed and farted at the same time. Oh! Oh, that's the new durbing! Yes! No... lis... no, no, durbing cannot be a sneeze-fart. That's snarting. I apologize for durbing. Please excuse me. Ladies, we gone. What about what he said about accepting each other's flaws? The image of that man washing his underwear in the bathroom of a two-star hotel is enough to make me clean my own damn house. - Good night, Durbie! - Oh. Good night, Durbs. Snart. What up, Durbs? - So Lynette's here, huh? - Yeah. Who's the... who's the guy she's with? That... that's Nico Marshak. He plays hockey for the Walleyes and he's the face of Muscle Milk. Are they, uh... Oh, they are a great-looking couple. I'm gonna get a picture of them for my vision board. Cheers. Oh, yeah. You know what? Um, I think I changed my mind. I'm gonna do a tequila shot after all. Yes! Take mine. Oh, okay. By the way, did I mention that this place has a hot tub? How can you stand Toledo? Ugh. By my count, there are 12 KFCs in this town. Well, actually 14 if you count the combination KFC and Taco Bells, which I definitely do. Yeah, it's crazy, man. It's a lot of... lot of fried... Hey, I uh... I can't even get a taco these days without ordering a side of mashed potatoes... - Oh... - And gravy. - Gravy. - Yeah. Which is not bad, I mean, you know, that way, you're bringing the two cultures together. You know, Mexican food and... No, no. Wait... Okay, wait. Kate, Kate, Kate. I can't. I got... I'm sorry, but it's a no. It's a... it's a no-go. "It's a no-go"? Seriously? Okay. You're not as fun as I remember. I'm sorry... - I, uh... - Whatever. I'm gonna go kill a Toblerone. Hey, what are you guys doing here? We came here to make sure you have her my application, which you didn't. You ever need any tips on how to seal the deal, just let me know. You were close, my man. Proud of you. - Yeah, what happened? - Can't you see he's heartsick? His soul mate is on a date with a strong, handsome milk celebrity. Look, Sarika, I'm out, okay? I'm sorry, I just... I couldn't do it. But you can still get your application into her folder. I mean, at this point, you guys should know how to accomplish a mission like this on your own. I mean, we're... we're in a hotel, okay? There's a million uniforms you could use as disguises. There's a... there's a computer that literally prints keys. I found pool chemicals and a net. Grace, what are you gonna do with that? We're not dissolving anybody. This wouldn't fully dissolve a body. All right, look, you guys, you can do this on your own, okay? There's someone I need to go talk to. Hey. - Lynette. - Jack, what are you doing? Uh, did... did your hockey guy take off? - Did he leave? - Yeah, he just left. Oh. Uh, so it's been a crazy couple days, huh? I had this, uh, weird dream where, uh, you and I had these four fat Toledo babies together and, uh, you were super excited because I'd gotten you a vacuum cleaner. And I thought maybe I didn't want that, uh, but maybe now I think that it's not so bad. Ew. I-I don't... I don't... mm-mm. I don't want any of that. I don't even know your middle name. No, I know, I... It's Carson. That's kind of cool. You should go by Carson. Lynette, I'm trying... I'm trying to be serious. Jack, I heard you say there's nothing you'd miss if you left Toledo. I would miss you. Think I'm just... I'm afraid that if I admit to liking anything in Toledo I'll get pulled into the escalator gears and ground to a fleshy pulp. I... I like you and I'm... Glad I met you, and I don't know. I don't know, you just... you make me happy to be in Toledo. I'm just saying I don't want to date anybody else. I actually feel the same way. - You do? - Yeah. That's why I-I just ended things with Nico, so... You did? Have you guys been dating this entire time? Not the whole time. Oh! We were not exclusive. Wow. No, I know. Were you not dating other people? No. - Lame. - Okay. God. - Oh, my hero. - Yeah. - That's sweet. - You're turning blue. Love wins. Oh, look at this. This sub just durbed all over my work shirt. What, now you want glopping to be known as durbing? I don't have any kids. I... I can't have my only contribution to the Durbin legacy be a snart. Oh, are you kidding me? They are gonna name this "GD" high school after you someday. There are two people in this world that I would take a bullet for: you and Gus Wakiama. He's my neighbor, and he took a bullet for me. Well, took a bullet from me 'cause I was cleaning my gun. Feels like I owe him. - Jeez. - Ah, dang it. - Oberland rejected me. - Aww. They said I don't have a high school diploma. Well, yeah, because I didn't graduate from high school, you dummies. Well, it looks like Helen Henry DeMarcus is going back to high school! Good luck. Okay. I got so into character as a bellhop, I ended up working a 12-hour shift. All I care about is that the mission was a success and my application ended up in her priority folder. And since it was technically your idea to have us disguise ourselves as hotel staff, I still passed your manuscript along to my aunt. - Y-you did? - Yeah. She liked it, and actually wants to meet with you on Tuesday. In New York. Here's her card. Oh, my God. Way to go, Boss! Maybe you'll get a big book deal and leave, and we'll get a real teacher in time for the AP exam. Getting out, JG! This is very cool. Very, um... yeah, very... Very fast. F-faster than I had planned. But, uh... which is good, it's good. So are you in? Am I in? Yeah... well, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, pretty much definitely. I just gotta make sure that I'm free on Tuesday. I'm pretty sure I am. I just gotta check my... I have a calendar at home. That's my... sort of my master... I keep everything on there. So let me just, you know, give it a look-see. But, uh, yeah, no, looks like I could be, um... looks like I could... I could be out of here very, very quickly. Yeah. - Mr. Griffin. - Huh? We have a new student for you. Uh, yeah, no, I know. She's been fitting in really well. Yeah, great job, new kid. I've been here the whole time. Ah, you keep saying that. No, but Jack, this is somebody completely new. - Hiya, teach! - Have fun. Hi, guys. Oh, uh... wait, Ralph, I'm... Advanced Placement Biology. Oh, I gotta go to the bathroom, and it's an emergency. Excuse me, oh boy. It's called nerves. Plus the spinach quiche.
