 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Were you followed? No. I was very cautious, just like you said. Good. This could potentially be very embarrassing for us. Couple dudes like us not knowing how to unclasp a bra? Is that your sister's? Yep. My mom got rid of all of hers after a double mastectomy. Oh, my God.

 Eduardo, I'm so sorry. You never told me that. It's okay. She's safe now. (SIGHS) She was so brave through the whole thing. I've heard it said that women hold up half the sky, but it sounds like she's holding up more than her fair share. She's a queen for sure. Was it scary for you? It was. (SIGHS) I'm just glad she's okay.

 Okay. (SOMBER MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Oh, man. Okay, okay. Oh. No, no. That wasn't it. ♪ Next time, I'll listen to my heart ♪ ♪ Next time, well, I'll be smart ♪ (TENSE MUSIC) Okay, everybody, shut your teenage pie holes... Because your principal's here. Everybody, a round of applause for your principal. Come on. Let's go. (APPLAUSE) Hi. Hey. Um... You just hit me with an apple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I did. Oh, man, I am late as hell. (SCOFFS) Dale's got traffic stopped out by, uh, Secor. I guess he found a pothole, looks like a mouth. Well, that is amazing news, although I think we all have a headline of our own. Oh. Yeah, most of your students are part of Ms. Duncan's Young Entrepreneurs Club. Yeah, I bet everybody except Dan Decker are part of that nerdy-ass club. (LAUGHS) Actually, I'm in that club too, Mr. G. Oh, no. What are you guys doing to him? You are ruining him. Well, it's a great club. I doubt it. And they're always looking for the next big thing. Uh, by the way, how are things going with your philosophy book? Oh, pretty good. Yeah, pretty all right... A little birdie told me you have not yet found a publisher. Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet. This is the path you're on, Dan. Actually, I thought that was a pretty cool way to show he was the little birdie. (SIGHS) Oh, come on. Well, there is, uh, one publisher you have not submitted your manuscript to. RanDurb House. Oh, no. I, uh, finally finished your new book. This thing is smart. Why didn't you tell me about it, you egghead? Ye... uh, this is not my book. Well, I mean, it's your words, but the illustrations are by yours truly. Oh, God. I am speechless. Oh, great, Ralph. You're here. Perfect. I am here to announce the winner of this month's "Lunch with the Principal." It's Caleb Baker. Seriously? I won? You and I get to hang and talk about your days on the road with your old ska band The Skankee Doodles? You got it, rude boy. (LAUGHS) See you tomorrow at noon. Yes! Holy crap, yes! You see it, you write it down, and then it happens. You that bitch, Caleb. You that bitch. Ooh! Uh, Caleb? Can you not smoke? Yeah. All right, everybody. You know the routine, guys. Pass them to the center and throw them right in the little trash bag there. Appreciate it. A book of this caliber should not come with a set of crayons. The edible crayons are my idea. Well, in the end, we couldn't afford the edible crayons. (SIGHS) Look, uh, I'm sure you guys worked very hard to produce this abomination, but uh, Bobby Bunny learns to love his job at the carrot factory? Come on. I thought satisfaction in manual labor was the message of your book. Yeah, but for people, not for little cartoon bunnies. Mmm, the bunnies made it relatable. Marissa, slap Marcus. But I'm the bad girl. Oh, yuck. Ugh. All right, new rule: I don't want any you ever to refer to yourselves as bad girls or boys. But what if I've been a very bad boy? Dan, do you see? Do you see? Yeah. Yeah. Durbin was right to appoint me head of the Young Entrepreneurs Club because I like to make that money. You know, my little cash cows are presenting their project ideas this afternoon. You two should come and watch. I would love to. Oh, come on. What are you... What are you guys doing? Gimme these. Gimme these. What? I need more time with the maze. I have left-right blindness. Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Excuse me! What? I know you are not stealing my inventory. Okay, if you want these books, you're gonna have to pay for them. (SIGHS) All right, fine. I'll pay for them, but I'm taking them all, and you have to tell me everybody you've sold one to so far. ♪ One, two! (UPBEAT SKA MUSIC) (SNORING) ♪ One, two! ♪ If you ever hear a noise in the night ♪ ♪ Your body starts to sweat ♪ It shakes and shivers in fright ♪ ♪ You go and sleep with your mother ♪ ♪ She hates your guts, she knows that you love her ♪ Cool bunny book. ♪ It's obscene! Hey, Jack! No, hey! Aw! (SIGHS) ♪ One, two! ♪ And your girlfriend sweet little seventeen ♪ ♪ She's got her layered hair and her flared jeans ♪ No. No. No! It's mine. (GRUNTS) Ahh! Ha, ha! There you go! You got it! (LAUGHING MANICALLY) This is our presentation for the Young Entrepreneurs Club. Nowadays, there are over 75 million women in the workforce. So they don't have time to be messing with a bra clasp all day. Introducing the Velcro bra. Well, this nightmare's almost over. Oh, what's happening? Victor and Eduardo don't know how to undo bras. (LAUGHS) Yeah, that makes sense. (SIGHS) Hey, hey, Jack. Yeah? Big news. Okay, first, I just went by the faculty lounge. The book is completely sold out. Uh-huh. It's amazing. Second, I sent my copy over to Channel Six, and they wanna talk to us tomorrow morning. The one that got away. (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) Yeah, that all sounds great. So exciting. Um, I would love to, but you know, I can't miss class. Oh, gosh, well, I guess I could, you know, talk about your philosophy myself. You can trust Bobby Bunny! (CHUCKLES) You know what? Um, this is such a well intentioned thing, Ralph, but the philosophy world can just be so brutal... Hmm. In its criticism of new works, you know? And I'm just worried that, you know, some of the finer points may be lost on... On yo... on Bobby the Bunny. Well, I mean, it's just Bobby Bunny, but you know what? (SIGHS) You tell me to say, and I will say it. Oh, God. Uh, you know what? I will join you. Yes! And I'll do all the talking. All righty then! Oh, that reference. I'll see you tomorrow. Maybe we can listen to ska on the drive over. Yes, I'll see you tomorrow at noon. Awesome. Okay, my sweet, greedy angels. It's time to invest in a new venture. Now will we save the world? I do not care as long as we... ALL: Make that money. It's a college acceptance letter tracking binder. Give me something I can sell, Sarika. You know, something for the masses. The masses don't know what they want. The problem: Countless lost hours in America's meat packing industry waiting on slow bleeding hogs. The solution: The Piggy Whistle. ALL: Ooh! (GRUNTS) (DISTRESSING MUSIC) (IMITATING PIG SQUEALING) That's gonna be a pass. Next. Ms. Duncan, you don't like any of our ideas. What do you want? A stupid t-shirt with a fart joke? (CHUCKLES) Wait, Sarika, what'd you just say? Yo, Ms. Duncan, I got it. It's a t-shirt that says "Gone Tootin'." An irreverent take on the classic Gone Fishin' shirt. Now see, that's what I'm talking about. Now that smells like money. Excuse me. This is Popo, my beloved grandmother. Recently, she slipped on an orange while grocery shopping. Please, open your hearts and invest $500 to cover the deductible for Popo's knee surgery. Oh, Yuyao. Did you think this was the Young Charity Case Club? (LAUGHS) No. Put your hand down. You have to go with that one. Ooh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What if it's "Gone Tootin', Be Back at Poo-thirty." Okay, that's our next project. Boom. (LAUGHS) (LINE RINGING) Popo. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) We're live in 30. So what do you think? Jack, Jack. Too much or just right? No, no, Ralph, why'd you even bring that? Too much? All right. Yes. Why did you even bring it? Well, I thought it was a good idea. Okay, okay, oh, hey. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHTER) Okay. Oh, hi. Oh, hi. Ralph. Ralph. Hi, how are you? Wow, that's nice. Oh, that's Gucci, baby. Oh, that's cool too. Oh, you like that? Impressive right? I've got a guy. We'll talk after the show. (LAUGHS) Okay, yeah. Okay, so, um, I'm Jack. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Wrote the book, yeah. I was thinking we'd start by talking about Plato and then I would move on... And we're live in five, four, three... (CHEERY MUSIC) Good morning, Toledo. We're here with Jack and Ralph, two best friends that wrote one big book about bunnies. "Get Hoppy." (LAUGHTER) Oh, my gosh, you have to put these on. Oh, you know, those... Oh, you have to do it. No. (LAUGHS) Well, I'm... I'm here to talk about Jack's philosophy things. Yeah, yeah, we're not... That's... that's... Please. No, Ralph. No, Ralph. Ralph? Don't you mean Bobby Bunny! (LAUGHTER) Good morning, Toledo! We didn't know Bobby Bunny was gonna be here! Whoo, whoo, whoo! Oh, look at that! Whoo, whoo, whoo! (LAUGHTER) Uh, fascinatingly, the book really asks whether the drudgery of our daily mundanity, uh, is really drudgery at all, or is it actually... (LAUGHS) Uh-oh, looks like Mark's dozing off here. Yeah. Earth to co-host! (LAUGHS) (SNORING) I'm up. (LAUGHTER) I'm up. I'm up. I'm crazy. Crazy. Hey, do this for me: Tell me about this character, Bobby Bunny. Oh, yeah, we... Okay, here's what I'm wondering. Is a panda a kind of bunny? Because I heard it was actually a rat, and that makes me sick. So, so, Jack, my question to you is, are pandas bunnies or rats? Uh... Uh, if anyone out there works for a university, I am a former Harvard professor. I'm open to working in inclement weather. We'll be right back after the break. Making breakfast nachos with Chef Don Chacho! Ooh. Those are gonna be fun. (LAUGHS) And we're clear. (GRUNTING) Where am I in regards to the street? Uh, the... This way? Yes. (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) Okay. What a grump. (LAUGHS) Ralph, why don't you stick around and help us make nachos with Chef Don Chacho? Um, I... Hey, brother. Listen up. I'll tell you right now. I'd ride this wave, 'cause when you're hot, you're hot, and right now my friend, you are blazing. Well, I... I guess I can as long as they're carrot nachos! Oh, you are bad! (LAUGHTER) Nonstop! Nonstop! Bad bunny! Where are we getting these people? (BELL RINGS) (SIGHS) Oh. Hey, there, Mr. Morning Show! Yeah, uh, I need to talk to Durbin. Well, he's not back yet. What? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Should I shred some onions over these? (IMITATES CHEWING) (LAUGHS) (IMITATES CHEWING) He skipped lunch with a student? Look at him. He dressed like Beetlejuice for this. I'm ska. (SCOFFS) He's scared. I'm ska too. Very ska, but Durbin come back safe safe. Don't worry. And I'm a bunny! (LAUGHTER) (IMITATES CHEWING) It's go time. Yeah, I got this. I got this. Okay. The man, the myth, the legend, Coach Novak. So what if you didn't have to tell people what kind of man you are? Am I supposed to be telling people that? What if people saw how you were dressed and thought, "I know this man. He's edgy." Gone Tootin'. Ha! Boy, you got my number. (BANJO MUSIC) Oh, don't mind us. We're just raising money for Yuyao's grandmother. I guess we're what you might call a charity case club. Uh, Coach. Focus. So the shirt is $10. Coach, Coach, let me ask you a question. When you die, what are you gonna remember? The fart shirt or saving an old woman's knee? (SARAH MCLACHLAN'S "ANGEL") (BANJO MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Just give me back them cat pictures sometime. (THE STRANGLERS' "PEACHES") ♪ Strolling along minding my own business ♪ ♪ Well, there goes a girl and a half ♪ ♪ She's got me going up and down ♪ ♪ She's got me going up and down ♪ ♪ Walking on the beaches, looking at the peaches ♪ Ralph, why didn't you call? Did you dye your chest hair? Gucci, baby. Pew. I thought we were getting lunch. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Here. Got you something better. TV nachos. Hold my calls. I had a light beer up at the show, and this bunny needs to nap. (DOOR SHUTS) I'm so sa. This ends now. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) Look, I know you're gonna get all sad, but the morning show? (SCOFFS) That was an embarrassment for both of us. (SINISTER MUSIC) You were the embarrassment, Jack. I'm blazing. They love Bobby Bunny. They want me back on the show tomorrow. (CHUCKLES) Oh, okay. Fine. Good luck on the show tomorrow. I can't wait to see how it goes. (IMITATES CHEWING) I called this emergency meeting because the shirts aren't selling. I need new strategies. What if we changed the slogan to. "Be Back at Poo Squirty p.m."? Pee! "Pee Back at Poo Squirty p.m." "Gone Tootin', Pee Crack Shat Poo Squirty Dicks B.M." Okay, okay, Ms. Duncan, look. The shirts are not the problem. The shirts are perfect. It's optics. How are we gonna beat an old lady in a wheelchair? (GRIM MUSIC) (SIGHS) Thank you, Terrence. Thank you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey. Do... Oh. Ugh. (HORNS HONKING) (TENSE MUSIC) (SIGHS) I told you it'd make you feel better to feed the street. Oh, it does. Is that right? (LAUGHS) Canadians say "eh." You know what? I make a mean waffle. Oh. Oh, hey, um... Uh, Mr. Durbin, we're not gonna need you this morning. Oh, no, go check your clipboard, babe. Uh, Mark asked for me himself. We have a hot news story that's breaking. (LAUGHTER) All right, speaking of food... Mm-hmm. I just wanna introduce you to a very special guest, Dale the janitor. (LAUGHTER) Oh, just Dale is fine. Janitor Dale. Mm-hmm. We got a tip that you're the center of a Toledo sensation the Street Mouth. That's right. Mm. "Street Gotta Eat." Dale, what caused you, a lowly janitor, to take on world hunger? When I was driving into work, I noticed that the street was smiling and happy. Oh. But on my way home, I realized it was sad. Aw. That's why I fed it those peas. There's some great sweets in there. Yum. Muffins, doughnuts, cookies. He's not there. Maybe he we're on for Spaghetti Warehouse. I'm just double-checking. Do you want Spaghetti Warehouse? 'Cause you're dressed like Bob's Big Boy. But uh, mainly it's just cans of peas. (LAUGHTER) Of course, cans. Peas? Classic. Who needs peas when you've got carrots? Oh, it's a carrot storm! ♪ Bobby Bunny, dancing to-and-fro ♪ ♪ Bobby Bunny, good morning, Toledo ♪ Security. Ooh, here comes Mr. Policeman. Oh, but Bobby Bunny's too quick. He's too quick! Ow! (ELECTRICAL CRACKLING) Taser! Ow! (BLEEP)! Okay. (BLEEP)! Well, you got what you wanted. Ow! Shit! Looks like this is the end of Bobby the Bunny. Shit! Oh! (LAUGHTER) It's just Bobby Bunny. That's what happens on a live show, folks. (LAUGHS) (REWINDING) What makes the nachos breakfast nachos? Those would be eggs. Oh ho ho ho! Oh! (LAUGHTER) That's egg-cellent. Where did you go wrong? There from Tijuana's Egg Farm. Ooh. Oh, she had a job. Thank you so much. Yes, absolutely. You got cheese here which is... (SIGHS) I was blazing, Jack. I was... Just yesterday, and now I'm... colder than one of those fancy cold soups. Full disclosure, I'm the one who told Mark and Molly about Dale's Street Mouth. They would've found it one way or the other. That... that pothole looks just like a mouth. Yeah, it does, but it's a pothole. Ralph, I mean, you're better than a pothole. Thanks. (LAUGHS) You know, uh, it seems like Bobby Bunny was pretty happy working at the carrot factory. Whitlock High is my carrot factory. (SIGHS) Oh, Jack, I... My chest hair isn't black. I... I dyed it. Yeah. Everyone knows. It's okay. Yeah, but Jack, I didn't stop with the drapes. I, uh... I did the carpet too. I... my carpet is all messed up, just wall to wall. (SIGHS) Yeah, that's, uh... That's, you know, certainly something to get figured out. Yeah. (AWKWARD MUSIC) It's tough to, uh... Tough stuff, bud. (SIGHS) Yeah. Ralph Durbin, if you are not here to take this poor boy directly to Spaghetti Warehouse, you better turn your sweet patoot around. We got a 2:30 rez, rude boy. Hell yes! (LAUGHS) I'm so hungry. Okay. Oh. So The Skankee Doodles were about to open for The Toasters, but our trumpets had been stolen... Yeah. Ladies, you have been served. Yuyao's grandmother is now exclusively with the Young Entrepreneurs. Uh, we won. (LAUGHS) Except that our goal was to help Yuyao's grandmother all along. Right, so we all won. Yeah. Sure. Okay, I get to keep making my dope-ass shirts, and y'all get to stop pretending that you don't want one. I love the shirts. I just want one so bad! I love 'em. I love 'em so much. I like the part about "Poo-thirty." (LAUGHS) Flatulence. (CLOCK TICKING) (SIGHS) Uh, sorry to... interrupt? I just wanted to bring back the last remaining copy of your book. Destroy as you see fitted. Ah, well, that's sweet. You know, why don't you keep this one, Ralph? I, uh, I think I'm gonna keep one for myself. I was doing the word search, and it was a lot of fun. Oh. It was a bit of a doozy though. Lot of Spanish profanities in there. Uh, well, Eduardo helped me out with that one and... did not know that. Now I'm the one who is a very bad boy. Well, look, I... I wanna to apologize for saying I never needed you. I always have, and I always will. Well, you know, we just met in September, so... Yeah, okay. (LAUGHS) Hey, what'd you end up doing with your chest hair? The che... oh, well, I was able to bleach the drapes... Mmm. But had to take the carpeting down to the hardwood floor. Oh. (WHISTLES) Yeah. Do you know what I mean when I say that? (PLAYFUL MUSIC) Yes, Ralph, I know what you mean. Thank God. Yeah. Okay. (CHUCKLES) (HORNS HONKING) Peas on Earth. ALL: Peas on Earth. (MISCHIEVOUS MUSIC) Ah, the old street mouth pea can scam. (LAUGHS)
