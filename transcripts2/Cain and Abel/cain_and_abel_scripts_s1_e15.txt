 EPISODE 15 Get up, jerk. You arrogant jerk. A pencil pusher like you has a limit. You didn't think I could use a gun in Korea? So if Choe Bok-geun is meeting Oh Kang-ho, you're telling me to kill them both, right? Yes. Is that possible? Just get enough money ready to bring my family. When you came to Korea, who ordered you to kill me in Cheongju?

 The man who ordered me to kill you again in Korea was Lee Sun-woo, your brother. You've made us a lot of money up to now, but it's time to say goodbye. Man-ho! Boss, what's wrong? You! I didn't do anything. He told me to do everything. Paju Fire Station. There are a couple of neurotoxin addicts in the abandoned factory. What? Neurotoxin?

 Bring antivenin. Boss. Boss! No. You have the wrong number. I lost my memory but I just remembered this number. I said you have the wrong number. What are you saying? Why would you say I want you dead? What are you doing? Get it out of my face. But... the man who ordered me to kill you again in Korea... was not Mr. Oh... but Lee Sun-woo, your brother. What's your name? Lee Cho-in, you don't remember anything? Lee Cho-in, my brother. Did you check it out? Yes, that Choe Bok-geun was meeting Oh Kang-ho. And? What happened? I got rid of the two men from China but I lost Oh Kang-ho. What? It's okay. You have nothing to worry about. I'll make sure to tear that jerk apart. That's.... That's not important now. What did Lee Cho-in hear? What did Choe Bok-geun tell him? I don't know, I didn't hear them. All right. Don't leave loose ends. I'll call you. Lee Cho-in... Do you know everything now? You've finally... discovered everything? SUN-WOO Cho-in? Cho-in. Where are you now? Where are you? Cho-in. It's me. Where are you now? Lee Cho-in. Cho-in. Cho-in! Lee Cho-in! The person you are calling is currently unavailable. The person you are calling is currently unavailable. The person you are calling is currently unavailable. Dr. Lee Sun-woo. Mother. I was on my way to see you. Let's go home together. We can discuss today after tomorrow's-- Mother, we can discuss that tomorrow. Dr. Lee, nothing's wrong, is it? It's no big deal. I'll tell you later. Sun-woo! What's this? It's gum. Stick to me like gum, okay? Nothing will happen to me. Don't worry and go to sleep. Sun-woo! Sun-woo. What brings you here at this hour? Seo-yeon... Sun-woo. Just because... I just... I just missed you. Kim Seo-yeon, I just... I just missed you so much. Okay. I'm glad you came. Didn't... Cho-in come by? No. He didn't call you? No. Where did you go, Lee Cho-in? How? How could a brother... kill his own brother? How could a brother kill his younger brother? Lee Sun-woo! Mr. Lee, where are you? I'm so worried about you. Where are you? The quarterly meeting of the Neurosurgery Centre will be held tomorrow. Are you ready? Of course. As you know, it's our first official review of the center. It will help to soothe the board members who are currently swayed by the Emergency Medical Center. And at the same time, we also have to show the media that our Neurosurgery Center is doing very well. Don't worry. We have enough data to back our progress. Okay. Is something bothering you? I got... a call from Dr. Bang in Cheongju this morning. You did? Yes. He said he hasn't heard from Mr. Oh since yesterday. He asked me if I'd heard from him. Mr. Oh must have something to say to me. Mom, please leave it be. No matter who bothers you. I'll take care of everything. You just focus on the core area of hospital business. I'll be going then. Okay. How's Cho-in doing these days? I'm sure he's doing fine. All right. Miss Oh Young-ji? You're Young-ji, aren't you? Dr. Lee Cho-in? He is Dr. Lee Cho-in. I was your tour guide in Shanghai, China. I'm Oh Young-ji. You came to see Dr. Lee Cho-in? No... I was just... Cho-in's off today. Sorry? He's off? Yes. Doctor, I couldn't get in touch with Dr. Lee. If I'm right, he's probably at the summerhouse in Yang-gu. The summerhouse in Yang-gu? Yes, that's right. Give me a minute. What are you doing? You're telling her where he is? Here. It's not so difficult to find the place. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor! But you don't even know who she is. She helped Cho-in in Cheongju when he suffered from amnesia. Then maybe you should not have told her. I think Cho-in is faking amnesia. Maybe you're making things worse. I don't know what happened to him yesterday, but Cho-in has never called in sick before. He must be having a hard time. It'll be nice to have someone with him. So she's close to Cho-in like I am close to you, right? Do you want to kid around in this situation? And what kind of situation are we in anyway? Whatever the situation, "Whoever isn't in love right now is guilty." Here. You guilty? I'm not guilty. Cho-in, just don't get hurt. Miss Oh Young-ji, are you out of your mind? You're already requesting vacation time? I'm sorry, but something urgent came up. You're doing this and relying on someone to back you up? Backup? There's no one behind my back. Why do I bother talking to a defector? Do whatever you want! Thank you. She's really leaving? Miss Oh Young-ji! DESERT SHOOTING NEUROSURGERY CENTER APPROVED LEE CHO-IN VS OH KANG-HO AMNESIA MY RETURN TO BOSUNG HOSPITAL FAKE AMNESIA! THE MAN WHO ORDERED ME KILLED LEE SUN-WOO? You found everything out. Where are you... ...and what are you up to, Lee Cho-in? Cho-in. Cho-in, that's the sound of my heartbeat. Can you hear it? Yes, I can. Lee Cho-in, until my heart stops beating, I'll protect you. I'll protect you if anyone picks on you or beats you up. You'll never be alone. I promise. Okay, Sun-woo. Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee Cho-in. Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee Cho-in! You're here, Young-ji. Mr. Lee, are you okay? What happened to you? You're burning up with fever. Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee Cho-in! Mr. Lee, open your eyes. Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee. Are you okay? Mr. Lee. You've got your memory back now... so you should be happy. Why are you having such a hard time? Is anyone giving you trouble? Or... do you only show your happiness on the inside? Try to catch the bubbles, okay? Give me ten minutes. You could've waited ten minutes. The class wasn't over yet. Sorry. I'm sorry, but I couldn't wait any longer. This is a new side to you. Well, this isn't so bad sometimes. Give me the biggest one, over there. What are you making? Chicken rice porridge. GINSENG I'll take this and some Chinese dates, too. Okay. This potato dumpling is pretty addictive. Just like you. Try it. What's this? It's potato dumpling soup. I added some shepherd's purse for a taste of spring. Try it. We haven't been to this museum in a long time. The last time we were here was before I left for the States. You know what the painter Park Su-geun's wife was like? Well... She was his neighbor. The painter, who only had elementary education and was poor, couldn't do anything good for her. But he told her he'd make her happy as an artist's wife. That's awesome. I... am also a poor man who doesn't know... how much time he has left. But I want to make you happy... as my wife. Kim Seo-yeon... will you marry me? Sun-woo.... I know I'm rushing into this. I know you're right here with me... but I feel like you'll slip through my hands like grains of sand. I'm frightened. Mr. Lee Sun-woo, I told you I'm not going anywhere. I told you I'd stay by your side but you're still frightened? Don't do this. You know you don't have to do this. Seo-yeon, I don't know... how much time I have left. But if anything happens... Even if anything happens... can you promise me you'll stay by my side? I will. I promise. Let's not rush into anything. Let's not be pressed for time. Will you ask me to marry you again another time? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Seo-yeon. Mr. Lee, are you... Mr. Lee? Mr. Lee Cho-in? Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee Cho-in. Mr. Lee. Did you sleep well? Yes. Miss Oh Young-ji, are you all right in the head? What do you mean? Weren't you nursing me? Huh? So how can you sleep better than the patient? You were even snoring. That's not it. I just dozed off for a second. Did I really snore? Your snoring woke me up. I'm sorry. Let's go have some chicken rice porridge. My secret wife made me chicken rice porridge while I was sleeping last night. Let's go. Is it good? Yes. Maybe it's because Gangwondo is closer to my hometown, the food here tastes so familiar to me. Really? I'm not sure. Mr. Lee Cho-in. You're a hard person to figure out. What do you mean? You looked like the saddest person in the world last night, but you look like the happiest person on Earth today. I know. That's weird. Maybe I'm happy because I'm with you. Young-ji. Yes? When I go back to Seoul, I may not smile as much. But that doesn't mean I'm mad at you, so don't get the wrong idea, okay? I might become a really bad person. I know you're not a bad person, so it's okay. Then you trust me no matter what happens? Yes. I trust you. Young-ji. Now might be... the happiest moment of our lives. Dad. I can tell you everything in the world, but I can't tell you Sun-woo tried to kill me. What do I do with Sun-woo? I can't forgive Sun-woo. Now Dr. Lee Sun-woo will present his report on the quarterly revenue of the Neurosurgery Center. Thanks to your support, the Neurosurgery Center has made impressive progress in the past three months. During the past three months, the number of surgeries has reached over 200, showing 150% increase compared to the number prior to the opening of the Neurosurgery Center. And if you look at the number of outpatients who visited our center, the numbers grew steadily over the course of three months. This resulted in a very profitable quarter. In just three months, the center has generated 12 million dollars in revenue. Mr. Director. Until now, I couldn't really understand why some people were hung up on the foundation of a Neurosurgery Center. But what I've heard today has given me my answer. You want to bring in more patients here and make more money. That's it, right? Dr. Lee Cho-in, did you see the success rate of the surgeries performed in our center? It's 92 percent. What good is such a high rate of success if the patient remains in a vegetative state? Are you saying that even if the patient dies, the surgery is a success because you removed all the tumors? Is that the theory behind your center? Dr. Lee Cho-in, aren't you a resident of emergency medicine? What are you doing here at the Neurosurgery Center meeting picking a fight? Vice Director, Dr. Lee Cho-in is not here now as a resident but as a board member. Please acknowledge that. Please continue, Mr. Lee Cho-in. Mr. Lee Cho-in, do you have data... to back up your accusation? Of course. I have more than a few cases. What cases are you referring to? Show me the case accusing us of claiming the surgeries were successful even if the patient died. Don't you remember? There is a patient who became a vegetable after you operated on him. What? Lee Jong-min, the director of Bosung Medical Center. Didn't you operate on him? I guess Mr. Lee Cho-in has many complaints against my surgery on the director. So, what do you want me to do? I heard there is a protocol for every surgery performed in the Neurosurgery Center, and you are no exception. Case conference. Fine. Case conference. I'll do it for you. That arrogant jerk. How dare he come in and ruin the neuro meeting? A board member? Don't worry, mother. He won't be able to prove anything, even if we hold a case conference. I'm sure. Yes, what is it? What? Lee Cho-in called a special board meeting? What's on the agenda? Fax it to me now. Sun-woo. I think Cho-in is making his move. Cho-in, what's this? Read this, Dr. Kim. He called a special board meeting. What does this mean? NOTICE OF SPECIAL BOARD MEETING Lee Cho-in, you called a meeting without telling us? Don't you know we'll be outnumbered if we put it to a vote? That's why I brought some lunch. What are you saying now? Want to see this? Lunch? Sounds good. What are we having? It's the legal title to the property that Director Lee gave me. REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER OF RIGHTS Wow, the title! This is a bomb. For real! The Neurosurgery Center will be out of the picture with this. You were just using the case conference as distraction? No. The case conference will be the detonator. We have a lot to prepare. Dr. Kim and Jin-guen, you'll help me, won't you? Of course. We can't back out now. But just remember Dr. Kim and I work as a team, okay? What do you want us to do? NOTICE OF SPECIAL BOARD MEETING Lee Cho-in will wave the title in our face. We expected as much. Dr. Bang, how are you doing in Cheongju? Really? Then come back to Seoul. Your old position is still vacant. Come up right away. You're bringing him back to Seoul? Even if we deal with his title, we might still have to put it to a vote. We need to be ready just in case. Hey, it's already four o'clock. Already? You must be hungry. Want a snack? Sure. It's red bean jelly with ginseng extract. Thanks. Here, let me unwrap it for you. Okay. You look busy. You know how it is. Can I get some data on a surgery done last year? Test material? Just some data. Eat. This is good. It's good. Dad. Cho-in, that brat. All he came up with while he was hiding out was a case conference on your surgery. This time, I'll trample him for good so he can never get up again. You can look forward to it, father. Dad. Can you... hear me? Lee Cho-in. You can't have anything. NEUROSURGERY CENTER CASE CONFERENCE Why are you looking at me like that? I couldn't remember your face, so I wanted to take another look. They say people in love never get enough of looking at each other. Maybe I love you. Can I begin now? Seo-yeon and I, we are getting married.
