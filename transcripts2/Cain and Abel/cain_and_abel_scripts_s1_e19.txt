 Has Sun-woo's tumor gotten worse? Lee Sun-woo... Just say you're sorry. Tell me you were wrong. Then we can turn everything around. Because I always wanted to be Lee Sun-woo's brother, Lee Jong-min's child and Nah Hae-ju's son. Sun-woo... "Cho-in, my little brother, I'm sorry." Just those simple words... Please... No...

 I can't say it. Because my brother Lee Cho-in already died in China. EPISODE 19 Since when has Lee Sun-woo had his tumor? It's a recurrence. What? Seven years ago when he went to the States and cut off contact, that's when it was discovered. I wanted dad's acceptance... I wanted to become a cardiac surgeon to fix the heart of the woman I love, but I gave that up and transferred to the Neurosurgery. I’d gotten over with, I who my mother never held once. Even I’d gotten over it!

 The things I can't have no matter how hard I try... They came so easy to you. "I'm sorry," "my little brother." Please! Can we see the PACS? Yes. What are you doing? Director... Who ordered this? Who ordered a CT scan of my brain? You were rushed to the ER, and Dr. Lee Cho-in ordered it. LEE SUN-WOO Delete the data. Pardon? Delete the data and don't start the PACS. Didn't you hear me? Delete it now. Yes, sir... Dr. Shin. Don't tell anyone about this. Not Cho-in, not anyone. Got it? Yes, sir. Can we really delete this? Won't we get in trouble? You heard from the man himself. Cho-in. Can't you treat Sun-woo? Kim Seo-yeon... you know exactly what Sun-woo did to me. So how can you ask that of me? But he's your brother and family. The brother you lived with for over 30 years. No, I don't have a brother. Then you're just going to let him die? Cho-in, can you really do that? You think that I can't? Sun-woo, are you okay? Are you? What about the CT scan? Want to go take a look? Kim Seo-yeon, you should leave now. Lee Sun-woo, I told you not to do this to me. Lee Sun-woo! Lee Sun-woo! No way... Just in a few days...? Dr. Lee Sun-woo told me to delete it, but due to hospital policy, I saved it on the hard drive. Lee Sun-woo. Dad, have you known this? Lee Sun-woo is ill. With a straight face, he tried to kill me. And now he's sick. He tried to kill his own brother. Then he should go on living till the very end. Young-ji, you're not a bad person. I'm so grateful to you. Do you like it? Dr. Lee... Young-ji, what are you doing? I was doing a facial with the cosmetics you bought me. Bent on seeing our hospital go down in ruins? What do you mean? Even without the facial, all the male doctors drool over you. If you become even prettier, what's going to happen? Stop teasing. What's this? This? A laptop. Laptop? I guess my dad didn't like the last one. He picked it up and threw it on the floor. Is he that much better already? Young-ji, you can be such an airhead. So cute. Stop it. Can you bring it to my dad's room? Thanks. Don't worry. I'll fill your father in about this computer. Wait. Close your eyes. Bye. Let's go arm in arm. Come on, all the kids do it. Who do we have here, Lee Cho-in? Hello, Director Kim Hyun-ju of the Emergency Medical Center. Dr. Lee Cho-in. Sure, let's have a hug. The cops told me you've been cleared. Congrats. Thank you for believing in me. My arms are about to fall off. You've been through a lot. Good job. Have you been drinking? How could I not? The Emergency Medical Center is settled, and you're cleared of charge. Why, do I reek? We've got a long way to go, Dr. Kim. I mean, Director Kim. Yes, so much to do and a rough start, too. Come on, it's all settled. They haven't announced the board's decision. They'll try to get the Neurosurgery Center going again. The assistant director is holding off on the announcement. I'll take care of that. Can you make a transition committee for the center? Sure, the director and I had talked about that. Okay, let's start from there. I'm counting on you. See you later. Take care. Father, give it a try. Isn't this one easier to use? You'll be able to write faster. Give it another go, sir. OH YOUNG-JI Father, you remember my name? Thank you so much. Now try writing what you want. MISS OH YOUNG-JI... ...THE LETTER I'M WRITING... Ma'am. So what's this about Dr. Lee Sun-woo? As you may be aware, Dr. Lee isn't in a good condition. Sun-woo! The linear accelerator... ...actually worsened things. If we just leave him in his state, there's no telling if he'll make it another month or a week. Then... What's our option? We must have surgery immediately and begin therapy. Then can we save my son? No, we can prevent the situation from getting worse. At best, he'll have two more years. We should do it... If we want him to live even another day, we should do it. Yes. Do whatever you have to do to save Sun-woo. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. What brings you to my office? Aren't you going to offer me a seat? Get to the point. This is about the Emergency Medical Center. Please make the announcement by the end of the day. Is that an order? How dare you order me around? Did that sound like an order? Then just follow it. What? And you should kick Lee Sun-woo out. Kick him out? What do you mean! You're going to let a grade 4 brain tumor patient perform surgery? That's same as attempted murder. Trying to kill me wasn't enough? Actually Lee Sun-woo might die first. Lee Cho-in, are you threatening me now? Did it sound threatening to you? Fine, tomorrow... No, do it now. Office of the board of trustees, please. This is Assistant Director Nah. Please announce the board's decision now. I'll send the Emergency Medical Center blueprint as well. Satisfied? No. That's just a start. Excuse me now. Someone's waiting for you. Dr. Bang. What's this? The Director of Neurosurgery Center... Well, now he's just Dr. Lee Sun-woo. It's a summon for Dr. Lee from the ethics committee. The ethics committee? It's true! The Emergency Medical Center is now confirmed. And Dr. Kim Hyun-ju is the center's director. NEUROSURGERY CENTER CANCELLED EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER DIRECTOR: KIM HYUN-JU ORGANIZATION CHART A SUMMONS ETHICS COMMITTEE DR. LEE SUN-WOO So the ethics committee is conducting a witch hunt? Ma'am, you shouldn't react so emotionally. What? Since the case conference, we aren't getting many new patients. And many current patients are refusing treatment, asking to be transferred. Director Lee Jong-min's cherished Neurosurgery Department may be at risk altogether. And should the word of Sun-woo's condition get out, you'll be held responsible for any malpractice suits since you kept his illness a secret. Did Lee Cho-in ask you to tell me this? Did he tell you to do this? I'm an executive here at Bosung Medical Center. I can conclude that much on my own, ma'am. Get out. Get out of my sight now. Well, have a nice day. After all Sun-woo's been through to get here... Jerks! Jerks... Why aren't you doing your rounds? Sir, we want to continue to work as Neurosurgeons at Bosung. But we can't. What are you talking about? As you must be aware, we aren't getting any patients. Our interns want to gain experience, but there's no opportunity. And even the Neurosurgery Center has been scrapped. I'm sorry, but you must make a decision, sir. Are you asking me to resign as the center's Director and leave the hospital? That alone will save patients and... Save patients? You think you're qualified to demand this from me? You better have the qualifications first. Then I'll gladly listen. It's a summons from the ethics committee, sir. A SUMMONS ETHICS COMMITTEE ATTENTION: DR. LEE SUN-WOO COMPLAINANT: DR. LEE CHO-IN DR. LEE SUN-WOO WITH GRADE 4 TUMOR CONCEALED ILLNESS AND PERFORMS SURGERY Lee Cho-in... You're going to strip me of my doctor's robe? Because you disappeared, we got so many complaints from our Chinese guests. I'm sorry, ma'am. Thank goodness Ms. Yang came through. It could've been a mess. I really am sorry. I'll let it slide since it's your first time. Get back to work. Young-ji! Congratulations. What do you mean? The board made its decision on the Emergency Medical Center. Emergency Medical Center? The Emergency Medical Center Dr. Lee Cho-in wanted. Really? So this is good news for him? I thought you knew it more than anybody. Young-ji. Dr. Lee. Let's go eat. I heard about the good news, is it true? Yes, my dad's wish is about to come true. That's so wonderful! And about your father... Lee Cho-in! Young-ji, give me just a minute. No, take your time. It won't be long, so just wait. Lee Cho-in. Trying to take away my medical license? You're not qualified to be a doctor. What? The tumor in your brain is 4.7cm big. And you've been performing surgeries? That's my concern. But it concerns patients' lives. What if you have a seizure during surgery? Do patients' lives mean that little to you? Actually, I bet they do. That's why you can even kill your own brother, right? Don't you know how important being a neurosurgeon means to me? Why don't you know that? I'm doing this because I know. Why, you punk... There's no strength in your right hand. Could it be flaccid paralysis? You're not qualified to be a doctor, so take off that robe. No, over my dead body. I can't give up being a doctor even if means my life. Then stand proud before the ethics committee and testify. Young-ji. Yes? What should we eat? So is this Emergency Medical Center that important? Isn't that driving a wedge between you and Dr. Lee Sun-woo? It's all over now, so you don't have to worry. But I'm still worried. He's your one and only brother. I appreciate the concern... But let's just talk about us, okay? Sure... And give me a little affection, too. Dr. Lee... What's wrong? You said you love me. What? That's what you said last time. Didn't you? We didn't get a chance to go out that night. Want to go tonight? Tonight? Sure. Are you okay? Yes. Dad. I never wanted to outdo you. Not even for a moment. I just wanted to be like you... I was just following your footsteps. If this, too, is your intention... I should follow it. But, dad... To be stripped of my doctor's robe... I won't stand for that. I would rather die. Dad... Just a bit earlier... If you'd held my hand just a bit earlier... Just a little bit... Dad... Dr. Lee, back where I'm from, nights were dark with all the lights turned off. But here, the nights are pretty with these bright lights. Every one of those lights must've been turned on by someone. And those lights become homes and families... If we become a family, will we be like those lights? I wonder what your family is like. I bet they're regular folks. Who love and care for each other. I'll find out when I meet them. What do you mean? I'm looking for information on your parents. We should get some good news soon. Dr. Lee. Too early to be touched yet. You can't push me away once I meet your family. How could I ever push you away? Even if you asked me to, I'd never let go of you. Never. Let me call. Where's Dr. Lee Sun-woo? Pardon? I see. Dr. Lee Sun-woo isn't in today. Dr. Lee Cho-in, Dr. Lee Sun-woo is absent today. Shall we go on? No, we'll do it when he's here. Is that okay? Thank you. Please leave a message after the beep. Lee Sun-woo, where are you? Hiding like a coward? But you were so high and mighty. Come on out. You've got nowhere to hide. Hello. Hi, Seo-yeon. I haven't heard from Sun-woo in three days, so I was worried. You haven't heard from him either? Then... Ma'am. Have you found Sun-woo? The police just found his vehicle. Where? In Gangwondo. Gangwondo? Perhaps at the Belly Button House? Belly Button House? Your family's summerhouse. It's located right in the middle of the country. So Sun-woo and Cho-in used to call it the Belly Button House. I'll go there and then call you. Would you? Dr. Kang Seok-hoon. How bad is Dr. Lee Sun-woo's condition? The linear accelerator only worsened his condition. Unless he has surgery right away, there's no telling how long he has left. You're going to strip me of my doctor's robe? I spent all my days and nights in operating rooms But dad never acknowledged me. He didn't even give me a chance. It may not mean much to you, who hogged all of dad's love, but it was important to me. You were my brother, I loved you the most in the world... You were my idol! You were like a religion to me! My brother Lee Cho-in already died in China. Lee Sun-woo, I still can't forgive your sins. Cho-in. Cho-in, that's the sound of my heartbeat. Can you hear it? Yes, I can. Lee Cho-in, until my heart stops beating, I'll protect you. I'll protect you if anyone picks on you or beats you up. You'll never be alone. I promise. Do you remember? When we were little, when I used to go around smiling... mother would chide me and ask me why I had so many reasons to smile about. But I had no reason to smile back then. Lee Sun-woo, you were... the brother I loved the most in the world. Sun-woo came back after three years. It felt like a dream. We were so happy, we hugged and cried. Sun-woo, where are you hiding? I miss you. Happy birthday, my big brother. Happy birthday to you. I haven't seen you in four years. Come home soon! I regret it... Cho-in... So much that I feel like dying... I regret it. Why... Sun-woo, where are you? Can you come pick me up...? Where are you? Can you take me to Seoul...? I'll be right there. Sun-woo! Sun-woo, it's okay. Everything will be fine... Sun-woo, can you hear me? I'm right here. Seo-yeon is right here beside you. Sun-woo, it's been seven years since my heart transplant. You and Cho-in have caused me so much grief. I don't know how much longer I can last. I no longer want to live with someone else's heart. I'm tired of waiting for the one I love. So whether it be two months or two years, please get the treatment. Wake up, get on your knees and ask Cho-in for forgiveness... And we'll live together... Okay? You can hold my hand... and take me for walks like you used to. Read to me like you used to. And you have to put me in a wedding dress, too. Get up and tell me that you love me. Okay? Are you awake now? I'm sorry... For being this way... I'm so sorry... Lee Sun-woo... Seo-yeon... Can you take me to Seoul? Can you take me to Cho-in? Yes, let's go. Let's go see Cho-in. LEE CHO-IN LEE CHO-IN, MY SON... -Good morning. -Hi. Good morning. Hi. Sun-woo's not here yet? Isn't that Dr. Lee Sun-woo? He disappeared after the ethics committee summons. Will he lose his medical license? Doesn't he look ill? He really must have a tumor. Seo-yeon, can you let me walk by myself from here? Sure, be careful. Cho-in. What? Are you afraid that you might die? So you threw away your pride and showed up? So you can live? Yes, that's why I came. Lee Cho-in, I want you to do my surgery. What? You decide whether I live or die. Why should I? You’re going to die anyway. So why should I save you? Whether I live or die, I want it to be at your hands. Lee Cho-in, do the surgery. I won't. And I'll watch you slowly wasting away, painfully regretting what you did. Jin-geun. Yes? Think Cho-in will do Sun-woo's surgery? He has no choice but to do it. It's his brother. That's what worries me. These days, Cho-in couldn’t care less even if Sun-woo were to die. Well, you do have a point... Is that true? Dr. Lee Cho-in refused to do Dr. Lee Sun-woo's surgery? Everyone at the hospital has heard. I didn't think Dr. Lee Cho-in could be so callous. Want some help? No, I got it. Okay then. NEUROSURGERY CENTER DIRECTOR LEE SUN-WOO This meant everything to me... Sun-woo! Sun-woo! Somebody help! Sun-woo... How long has he been like this? Just happened suddenly five minutes ago. Do an emergency CT scan and get ready for surgery. Cho-in... Dr. Lee, remain still. Lee Cho-in... Sun-woo! Move him to the operating room. If we just leave him in this state, there's no telling if he'll make it another month or a week. How can someone kill his younger brother! When I came back from the States, I thought dad would build me the Neurosurgery Center. But the only thing that was waiting for me was a piece of paper that made you the owner of the land. He didn’t choose me, but you, Lee Cho-in. Whether I live or die, I want it to be at your hands. Lee Cho-in, do the surgery. Dr. Lee Cho-in! Cho-in, where are you? I'm looking at the CT scan, it's a brain hemorrhage. But the bigger problem is the increasing cranial pressure. If he doesn't go into surgery, there's no telling what may happen. Cho-in, are you listening? Dr. Lee Cho-in! Lee Sun-woo... Just die. We have to stop the hemorrhaging and remove the tumor! Where's Cho-in? Sun-woo refused to have the surgery unless Cho-in did it. Call him again. But you were just in there. Is that how you think of me, too? As a jerk who won't do his only brother's surgery? No, I know how you feel. That not doing the surgery, puts you in more pain than doing it. I'm standing my ground this time.
