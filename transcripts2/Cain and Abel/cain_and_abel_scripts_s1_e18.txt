 Young-ji, you've been worried about me, right? Everything will be over tomorrow. Then... would you like to have a family with me? Vice-Director Nah Hae-ju, just as you, who I've wanted to call mother for 30 years, killed my parents, Lee Sun-woo tried to kill me, too. Yes, I did it. I killed your parents. But Sun-woo didn't do anything wrong. Don't hold him responsible for my sins! Ask your son yourself.

 Lee Cho-in, are you crazy?! Sun-woo... What is family? Why is Lee Cho-in still alive? What is family? A painful death... Let him die in agony. EPISODE 18 Out of 14 members of the board of directors, excluding Mr. Oh, who's been out of touch, ten will be attending the meeting. And we brought the attorney and the planning director over to our side again by offering them shares in the venture company linked to the Neurosurgery Center.

 And with Mr. Yoon Hyung-seok, who took Dr. Cho Hyun-tek's place, our director Lee Sun-woo, and myself we'll have five votes total. What shall we do about the rest of the votes? I'll take care of the rest. Mr. Oh. I've been trying to get in touch with you. Why haven't you return my calls? The vice-director bought our company stocks. Really? Then you should buy my-- -Shall we go? -Yes, let's go. We're at Cheonggyecheon. Cheonggyecheon was a stream that flowed through center of Seoul. You can take pictures here. Lee Cho-in, this is your last chance. Nobody will get hurt if you give up on the Emergency Medical Center. You took the words right out of my mouth. Reveal the truth at the meeting. That still won't earn you forgiveness, but I'll take it into consideration. You'll regret what you just said before the meeting is over. THE 5TH REGULAR BOARD MEETING We'll now begin the fifth regular meeting of the board of directors. Mr. Lee Cho-in has asserted his ownership of the lot previously designated for the Neurosurgery Center. Therefore, the construction of the Neurosurgery Center will be put on hold, and the use of the land will be put to vote again today. Oh Kang-ho, Young-ji became prettier since she came to Seoul. Young-ji. Today's Cheonggyecheon is where people and nature come together in harmony. Mr. Lee Cho-in, would you share with us your vision for the new Emergency Medical Center? It seems Mr. Lee Cho-in has an urgent personal matter to attend to. Gentlemen, could you give him a moment? Hello? Oh Kang-ho, long time no see. Choi Chi-soo. You and I have some unresolved business. What do you want? Come here. I'm with Oh Young-ji. We can talk when we meet. Choi Chi-soo. Choi Chi-soo! Dr. Lee Cho-in, shall we continue with the meeting now? Lee Sun-woo... you didn't do this, did you? I told you. If you give up on the Emergency Medical Center, nobody will get hurt. I can't give it up. Then will you give up... Oh Young-ji instead? No. I can never give up on both. Dr. Lee Cho-in, would you like to say something? The Emergency Medical Center has to be built on the land I received from the director. That plan will never change. Let's begin the vote. THE 5TH REGULAR BOARD MEETING -Who are you? -We're the police. Is Mr. Lee Cho-in here? Mr. Lee Cho-in? You know Choe Bok-geun, don't you? You're under arrest for the murder of Choe Bok-geun and Yang Man-ho. Lee Cho-in, you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to have an attorney Anything you say can and will be used in the court of law. Look! What's all this about? You're arresting Dr. Lee Cho-in for murder? Aren't you mistaken? Isn't he Dr. Lee Cho-in of the Bosung Medical Center? Show us proof. On what grounds are you arresting him? He made a call to 911 on the day of the murder from the site the murders took place. And we have a testimony from the cab driver who picked him up at the factory and drove him to the hospital. Is that enough? Nonsense. You mean, Dr. Lee Cho-in... is a murderer? They say you never who a man is. I thought he was a good man. -He almost had us fooled. -Let's go. Wait. Wait. Give me a few minutes with my brother. You don't think I'll tell the police what you did if I'm taken away now? And if you do? Who will believe you? Didn't you kill Choe Bok-geun, the only man who could prove you're telling the truth? What? And... Oh Young-ji is still in my grasp. Lee Sun-woo, this isn't the end. You just wait. That's also what I want. Because I... want... to kill you. Don't worry. I'll hire the best lawyer in the country for you. Let's go. Mr. Lee Cho-in, we need to take your phone away. It's evidence. Come here. I'm with Oh Young-ji. We can talk when we meet. This is most unfortunate. I am most ashamed as his mother and acting director. But given the importance of the agenda at hand, let's put it to the vote and make a decision today. Yes. Mr. Oh, what's going on now? Just wait. I need to assess the situation first. Vice-Director. Is this vote that important now? We can vote after we save Mr. Lee Cho-in-- Dr. Kim Hyun-ju, Lee Cho-in is my son. I'm the one who's hurting the most right now. Do you know how much we pay in interest every day, every time we postpone our decision? And what about our image? Let's not lose the sight of more important things because of our personal feelings. Let's begin. Shall we begin the vote now? May I say a few words before we do? I'd like to answer a few questions you might have about the Neurosurgery Center, which will lead the Bosung Medical Center into the future. Will that be all right? -What's going on? -That's Doctor Lee Cho-in. Wait. Can I use the restroom first? Nothing like this has ever happened to me, and I'm a bit nervous. We're at the Changgyeong Palace. Follow me. You can take pictures here. Your call will be forwarded to voicemail... Could you take a picture for us? Of course. One, two, three. Smile! -Thank you. -My pleasure. -One more, please. -Sure. One, two, three. Say cheese! Mr. Lee, are you done? Mr. Lee Cho-in. Mr. Lee Cho-in. Mr. Lee? What the hell? Maybe he swallowed something. He's not breathing. He received surgery for chordoma and an aneurysm rupture, just as Director Lee did. We successfully removed the tumor and the patient has recovered his motor and sensory skills. At the last case conference, I was questioned about my ability as Director of Neurosurgery Center. Can you still question it after you see the result of this surgery? Dr. Lee Sun-woo, the issue raised by Dr. Lee Cho-in at the case conference was that you risked a patient's life to promote the hospital. Dr. Kim, do you think the hospital could force a patient to agree to something like that? The patient, Ms. Choe Yu-rah, agreed to it. And she saved her precious life. You can't deny that, can you? Shall we begin the vote now? Kim Jin-geun, you know I'm in the meeting. I'm at the ER now. Cho-in's in here for asphyxiation. The police are here, too. Come quick. What, Cho-in is--? All right. May I cast my vote when I come back? Sure. Oh, God. Hurry. What's going on here? What's with the police? Get out of the way. -How's his condition? -He has something blocking the airway. -What does he have in there? -What did you do to him? -Dr. Kim. -Yes? Would you please clear the area? All right. Excuse me. "Dr. Kim, I'm innocent. I need to get out of here to prove my innocence. Young-ji's in danger. I need your help." Laryngoscope and long forceps. Nurse, you trust me, don't you? Yes. He's in a bad shape. Book an OR. It's lodged deep inside. -We can only get it out with surgery. -Yes, Doctor. Detectives, will you take his handcuffs off? We need to go into emergency surgery. -We really can't... -Are you going to let him die? You want me to testify that you killed a suspect while taking him into custody? Hurry up. He's dying. -Get an OR now! The keys! -Yes, Doctor. Hurry. Move him. You called Surgery, right? Get the door. You can't come in. Not here! This room. I don't know what we're doing. Cho-in, we're safe. What's going on? I'll tell you later. Here. Go change. Jin-geun. What now? We'll start the voting now. Members of the board, kindly make your voices heard. Mr. Oh, what are you going to do? We should go with the majority, right? But what if Lee Cho-in tells the police we're the ones who ordered his kidnapping? This is a mess. How's the suspect's condition? We don't know. The thoracic surgeons are doing the surgery. How long will it take? Who knows? They'll know once they open him up. Thank you for your service-- Please excuse me, could you clear the way? Detective, do you get regular check-ups? You don't look too well. A bit of jaundice-- I'm sorry, but I have to go back to the board meeting. You shouldn’t skip regular check-ups while you’re still healthy. See you. Cho-in, be careful. Dr. Kim. You should go back to the meeting. Okay. I'll be back. I'm not too late, am I? Of course not. Please vote. Dr. Kim, what happened to Cho-in? Is there a problem? He went into surgery to have a foreign body blocking his airway removed, but he disappeared. Mr. Oh, Dr. Bang, Dr. Lee Cho-in sends his regards. Emergency Medical Center. Emergency Medical Center. NEUROSURGERY 4 EMERGENCY 3 Emergency Medical Center. NEUROSURGERY 4 EMERGENCY 5 Emergency Medical Center. Four votes for the Neurosurgery Center and six votes for the Emergency Medical Center. It's been decided the Emergency Medical Center will be built. Choi Chi-soo, answer the phone. Comrade Oh Young-ji, it's been a long time. Young-ji, please pick up. Come on! Dr. Lee Cho-in. Where are you? Where are you now? Me? Yes. I'm coming to pick you up now. Dr. Lee, don't come. What are you saying? You can't come here. Don't come. Young-ji! Young-ji, what's wrong? Young-ji. Young-ji? Young-ji! Oh Kang-ho. Oh Young-ji must like you a lot. Choi Chi-soo. Come here now if you want to save Oh Young-ji's life. You know you have to come alone, right? Where are you? All right. I'm coming now. Who was it? Who betrayed us? How could we lose by two votes when Lee Cho-in wasn't even there. Mr. Oh, was it you? Mr. Oh In-geun, why did you betray us when we bought the stocks as you asked? You should ask Lee Sun-woo why. What? What are you saying? Didn't you know he used the men we hired to kidnap Lee Cho-in in China and tried to kill me. -What? -Thanks for buying my stocks, but I'll accept it as your apology for Lee Sun-woo trying to kill me. Then... who's the other person? I'm sorry, Vice-Director. Dr. Bang... since when... When you sent me away to Cheong-ju, Mr. Lee Cho-in promised to bring me back. Please excuse me. Those jerks... Jerks! I heard we won. -Congratulations. -Yes, thanks. You'll be the director of the Emergency Medical Center now. -Congratulations. -That's enough. You want to do that now when Cho-in's been accused of murder? I'm just happy. So? You have Oh Young-ji now? That anesthetic you gave me works wonders. I barely touched her with it, but she's out cold. What about Lee Cho-in? Did you lure him to the place I told you to? Of course. You can't make a mistake. Don't worry. I'll call you once I get rid of Lee Cho-in, -that son of a... -No. Lee Cho-in taking his last breath... I'm going to see that for myself. Sun-woo... they've decided on the Emergency Medical Center. What do we do? Mother... the Emergency Medical Center will never be built. What do you mean? Because the man who'll be in charge of the center... will never come back. Sun-woo! Mother... no matter... what I do... you'll still love me, won't you? Yes. I love you, my son. I love you. That's all I need. I love you too, Mother. CALL HISTORY CALLING Choi Chi-soo. -Choi Chi-soo. -Oh Kang-ho. No, I mean, Dr. Lee Cho-in. Choi Chi-soo, did you kill Choe Bok-geun? Yes, I slashed their throats with this knife. CALL TIME 02:57 Oh Kang-ho, there's no need for words between us. You should go join Kang-chul now. Oh Kang-ho, you must know, since you're a famous doctor in South Korea, that you'll be dead in two minutes if I slash your throat with this thing. Here, I'll send you away now. Dr. Lee. No, Dr. Lee! Young-ji, don't look. No, Dr. Lee! Young-ji, don't stop me. I love you! I love you, Dr. Lee. Did you already forget the Lee Cho-in I love? I don’t want to see... the man I love ruining his life. Dr. Lee... didn't you... didn't you ask me to be your family? I don't ever want to lose my family again. Choi Chi-soo! Don't move. Oh Kang-ho. I mean, Mr. Lee Cho-in, we recorded Choi Chi-soo's testimony through your phone, so you'll be cleared of the murder charges. Oh Kang-ho! You son of a...! I'll kill you! Young-ji... I still have things to do. Will you wait for me a little longer? Go on first and wait for me. You trust me, don't you? Yes. I trust you, Dr. Lee. Let me go! SUN-WOO Your call will be forwarded to voicemail... Pick up, Choi Chi-soo. LEE CHO-IN Choi Chi-soo isn't here. Lee Cho-in. Where are you? I'll be waiting. Seo-yeon, I abandoned Cho-in. Because if I didn't... I couldn't have you what little time I have left. It was so difficult... for the past seven years... being alone. -Sun-woo. -Don't come! Seo-yeon... Don't look at me. Please don't look at me. Because I knew my recurrence of the tumor cannot be treated this time... I thought I'd be okay if I could spend the rest of my life with you. LEE SUN-WOO Don't turn on the light, Lee Sun-woo. I'll want to kill you if I see your face. Why did you try to kill me? Since when? I doubt it was from when we were little. You were the first person who held my hand when I was in the incubator. Cho-in, I'm your brother. Your big brother. Yes, I did. Because you were just a pathetic little monkey back then. Yes. So when did it begin? Probably not when you came back from the States. Sun-woo! Lee Cho-in. Because you were still the same Lee Sun-woo I knew from long ago, right? That's right. Because until then, you were a docile little brother. Then the reason you tried to kill me was... only because of the Neurosurgery Center? Did you just say "only because?" It may not mean much to you, who monopolize all of dad's love, but it was important to me. Lee Cho-in, I wanted dad's acceptance. I wanted to become a cardiac surgeon to fix the heart of the woman I love. But I gave that up and transferred to Neurosurgery. I spent all my days and nights in operating rooms for the past seven years because I wanted to follow in dad's footsteps... and become the most respected neurosurgeon. But dad never acknowledged me. He didn't even give me a chance. That's... a good enough reason to kill me? Even so... how could a man kill his younger brother? When I came back from the States, I thought dad would accept me for once... and build me the Neurosurgery Center. But the only thing that was waiting for me was a piece of paper that made you the owner of the property. Dad... He didn’t choose me, his biological son, but you, Lee Cho-in. And... I wanted to get Seo-yeon back. She was my woman from the beginning. Lee Cho-in... you know what? The things I can't have no matter how hard I try... they come so easily to you. That's why... so you could take dad and Seo-yeon away from me... you along with mother and Mr. Oh, sent me to China? -Mother wasn't part of it! -Don't lie, Lee Sun-woo! You think you can cover up her sins when she killed my parents and left our dad to die? Do you really? You remember? When we were little... when I used to go around smiling... Mother would scold me and ask what I had to smile about. But I had no reason to smile back then. I thought if I always smiled... Mother would see my smile... and hug me at least once. But she didn't hug me even once. Never. She didn't even let me call her mother. I got over it. Me, who was never held by my own mother. Even I got over it! Maybe Mother could've forsaken me... but you, Sun-woo, should not have. Because you were... the brother I loved the most in the world. You were my idol! You were like a religion to me! Lee Sun-woo, my big brother... just say you're sorry. Just tell me you were wrong. Then we can turn everything around. Because I always wanted to be Lee Sun-woo's brother, Lee Jong-min's child and Nah Hae-ju's son. Sun-woo... just say... "Cho-in, my little brother, I'm sorry." Just those simple words... please. Please! No. I can't say it. Because my brother Lee Cho-in already died in China. Then... I too... will have to erase my brother... my one and only brother. Lee Cho-in, if I could be forgiven by doing so, I could say those words a hundred, a thousand times. But it's too late... for that. I'm sorry, my little brother. I'm really so sorry. LEE SUN-WOO Kim Seo-yeon. I... just finished... talking with Cho-in. By tomorrow, I'll have become the most despicable man... who tried to kill his younger brother, stole his brother's hospital, and coveted his brother's woman. Then people will... cast stones... and lash out at me. Kim Seo-yeon, but my love for you was sincere. I'm sorry I hurt you because I didn't know how to love properly. But meeting you... and loving you... and the times I spent missing you... were the happiest memories of my life. I'm sorry, Kim Seo-yeon. Where are you? Let's meet now. Lee Sun-woo, you fool! You should have at least someone on your side before everybody turns their back on you. Where are you now? Sun-woo. Sun-woo! Mr. Lee Jong-min, my greed probably caused all this, right? Will everything be able to go back to their places if I give up my life? Will Cho-in forgive Sun-woo if I give up my life? There's no turning back now, is there? I can only be forgiven with death, right? Dr. Lee... Dr. Lee... are you all right? Young-ji, it's all over now. It's all over, but... I thought I'd be happy if everything was over. But why does it hurt so much? Dr. Lee... I don't know how it ended, but if you're hurting... the other person must be hurting, too. However, I hope you'll get over this soon and go back to being your old self. I liked you when you were Oh Kang-ho, but I like the Dr. Lee Cho-in I met in China much better. All right. I'll go back to the Lee Cho-in then. Yes, you have to do that. -It's the ER. -What are you doing? I thought patients come first to you. -I'll be back soon. -Bye. What do we have? You have CT images? Yes. I need you to take a look. I don't see any fracture or hematoma, but I see a mass in the left frontal lobe. Maybe it's a tumor. -Take a couple more pictures. -Yes, right away. LEE SUN-WOO Lee Sun-woo? Cho-in. Seo-yeon. Is Sun-woo all right? His tumor... did it get worse? Kim Seo-yeon, you knew? Lee Cho-in... you didn't know? I told you. I wrote in the letter. I told you he was sick. I asked you to fix him.
