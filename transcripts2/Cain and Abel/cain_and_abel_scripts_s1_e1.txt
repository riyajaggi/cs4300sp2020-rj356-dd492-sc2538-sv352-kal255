 My name is Lee Cho-in. I got shot in the head and side while I was in China. Now, I'm dying. My breathing has become rapid and weak. My hands and feet are turning blue. The thought of dying like an abandoned dog frightens me. But what really frightens me... is that all my memories are disappearing like grains of sand. Mr. Lee Cho-in from Seoul! I love you. I love you...

 We have a medical emergency. If you are a doctor or a nurse, please inform the flight attendants. Thank you. Hold her tighter! Please hold her still. There is a doctor in the first class cabin. Please bring him here. He took a sleeping pill a while ago and told us not to wake him up. A person is dying! Go wake him up and bring him in. What is the condition of the patient? Seizure. She's having a seizure. Please prep the EMPA. Please hold her still. It's been 15 minutes since the injection of Lorazepam 3mg. She stopped convulsing. She has papilledema. The optic disc is swelling. Papilledema? We have to decrease the absorption of Cerebrospinal fluid immediately. How long until we get to the airport? About 15 minutes. Notify the Airport Emergency Services and ask them for a twist drill. Hurry! Do you have the twist drill ready? No, sir. Sorry, but we don't have any here. Is the drill ready yet? Yes, here you go. -Hold down the patient. -Okay. What if something goes wrong? If we don't do this now, she'll die... and I'll take all the responsibility. Hold her still. I'm making a puncture. -Hold her head. -Okay. Not that one. Use the 18 gauge needle. Load 300cc of normal saline. -Start Elekta. -Yes, doctor. We have a car crash victim. -Where's the chief? -Holding a central line. Order Rutin EEG. -Check and notify the blood type. -Okay. Hold it. Where is everyone? I've been asking to hire more emergency staff over and over! That's why the director went out of his way to hire you. Why are there so many patients today? A major accident? -Look. -Yes, doctor. Don't you see the rupture here? -Call General Surgery. -Yes, doctor. Did you have any emergency surgery? What's an anesthesiologist doing here on a weekend? Just here to help an old, single doctor who has no life and to deal with her hysteria. Don't give me that scary look. Anyway, with the new Emergency Medical Center we'll be seeing each other a lot. I just want to develop a good relationship with you. Sir! -I like... -Sir! ...the thought of us having a good relation-- Intubation! What's going on? -Hurry! -Oh, man... Okay, I'll take care of it. Was that Dr. Lee Sun-woo? Yes, there was a medical emergency on the plane. A patient had an epileptic seizure due to an aneurysm and tumor. He drained the cranial fluid and is bringing her here. All that waiting has finally paid off. I'd better go and notify the press, doctor. Oh, wait, wait, wait... what should I tell them, doctor? "Dr. Lee Sun-woo from Johns Hopkins performs surgery in the sky." Something like that. I understand. Looks like you won't get your wish, honey. Mr. Lee Jong-min. How long has that patient been there? Ah... about two hours. -Did you call Neurosurgery? -Yes, but-- Don't you see the exophthalmos? It's an obvious sign of increased intracranial pressure! -Order a CT scan. -The patient is a John Doe. He has no ID or family-- Is that a valid reason not to do a CT scan in the hospital? Jin-geun, call Neurosurgery again. But I'm an anesthesiologist. -Do you pick a fight with me now? -Yes, doctor. Neurosurgery, NS. Right away! Hey. Why did they call everyone on a weekend? I was sleeping. Who called, Dr. Kim? -No, Dr. Bang. -Did he? Hello. -Hey. -Hello. What's going on? Did a war break out? Everyone from Neurosurgery is here. Look, it looks ruptured. Right? Why aren't any NS folks here yet? Sorry, I'm late. You loser! We called you ages ago! You want to treat a patient after they are dead? -I'm sorry. -It's a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Find a neurosurgeon for emergency surgery. But everyone's is on call for another surgery... All the reporters can come with me. Sure. So Dr. Lee Sun-woo, the director's son is doing an emergency surgery now? So every doctor in Neurosurgery is on standby? You've all lost your minds! Damn! We're going to lose a life. Man... poor guy. Let's send him to another hospital. What about Cho-in? Where is Dr. Lee Cho-in! -Give him a call. Hurry! -Yes, doctor. -Hey! -Yes? Have this kid looked at by a surgeon. What's wrong with him? He seemed to be a homeless kid begging on the streets. I think he has pan-peritonitis. I had to drag him here against his will. Little runt must be in a lot of pain. I'm fine, so let me go back. You monkey. Give him some antibiotics. Run a blood test and inject some CRP. You said he's homeless. Who will pay his bills? Put it on my tab. Dr. Lee, you can't keep doing this. -How often-- -Little monkey, you owe me one. Pay me back when you grow up. If you're broke... do you have an older sister? If you do, introduce her to me. Dr. Lee Cho-in! Did you get on that motorcycle after drinking? I sure can't fool you, Dr. Kim. Blood alcohol level, 0.01%. Just two shots of soju. Call other hospitals for a transfer. Yes, doctor. Nice going. Who's the patient? A John Doe with ruptured brain aneurysms. But everyone from the Neurosurgery is either at a conference, or on standby for a big fun emergency surgery. So duty beckons, but everyone's diddling around? -Is that it? -Yes, that's it. What's the point of coming to a hospital? You'll just die because no doctors are available to perform surgery. Dr. Kim, just give me 30 minutes. No. I can't let a drunk perform surgery. What are you guys doing? I told you to transfer the patient! That'll take at least another hour. I just need a bucket of cold water. Are you confident? I am, with your assistance. Okay, I'll get ready. See you in the operation room. Scalpel. A combined surgery for aneurysms and a tumor? This kid from Johns Hopkins really is amazing. I'll start checking the time. Start the stopwatch. Nine millimeter angled clip. It only took him 30 minutes to perform aneurysm surgery. Now he's removing the tumor. Lee Sun-woo? Why is that punk... OPERATION TIME Let's see how great Johns Hopkins is. Nurse. -Can you take out my IV? -Yes? There's more than half left. I also have a surgery to perform. Hurry! I'm sorry. -What is your name? -Pardon? I'm Park Su-rak, doing my fellowship. -You got lucky. -What? You've got lousy concentration. You're slowing me down. -I apologize. -Change positions. Doctor, I'm just in my second year. A brain tumor couldn't care less. Dr. Lee Cho-in's here, doctor. Dr. Lee, please explain your surgery plan. I suggest we start with the coiling, and then-- I'll do the pterional approach, clipping arteries first and then proceed to remove the tumor. Aren't you pushing it? Let's focus on the aneurysm first and then the tumor-- Both at the same time, that's the plan. Someone's doing the same two-for-one next door. Why can't I do it? Let's do it. Dr. Lee Cho-in, are you serious? Surgery isn't a competition. Just forget it! The patient couldn't breathe on his own, right? Well, right... His tumor developed in the left temporal which is currently blocking the cerebral ventricles. -So? -I understand that we must prevent further damage on the aneurysm... but if we don't remove the tumor now, this patient won't live long enough to have another surgery. Scalpel. Ah, there it is. It's an atypical rupture. -A straight clip may not do the job. -An angulation clip. Removing the temporary clip. Valsalva maneuver. We don't have much time. Hurry up, dude! Hey Dr. Lee, I know you're busy, but I'm still your senior, buddy. Transcranial Doppler. Very good. Take a break while we wrap up. Forty-three minutes! The aneurysm and tumor removal surgery is complete. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Thank you, Chief Lee. What's going on, Vice-Director? What do you mean? I have the final say as the Chief of Neurosurgery. No matter how urgent it is, no neurosurgery can be performed without my approval! Dr. Jo Hyun-taig, what's the founding principle of Bosung Medical Center? "Saving a life always comes first." Am I wrong? We should celebrate the success of this emergency surgery. You shouldn't be angry. Excuse me. The reporters are anxious to learn the details of the surgery. Nah Hae-ju... so you want to replace me with your young son. Well, let's see if your wish comes true. Dr. Lee, look... -What? -What's wrong? I'm sorry. There's too much bleeding. -We can't see. -More suction. You idiot, how much did you tear? Midbrain arteries have been damaged. One more. One more. We stopped the bleeding, but the damage is too extensive. Can we sew up in time? Once a brain artery has been torn like that, not even God can do it. Dr. Lee, it's time to give up. Will he respect our decision? Won't his ghost haunt us? I'm in no mood for jokes. Close it up. When the prayers for the dead stop, I hear crickets chirping. What in the world? I can't stand ghosts. Let's try again. -You got an idea? -Didn't you hear that? Hear what, punk? The patient just spoke. I was told to wrap up the torn artery with the skin from his head. It will work somehow. -Give me a break-- -No, that could work. It could hold with skin from the same part of the body. The surgery must go on. Clip, please. I'm home, Dad. It's been seven years. You've gotten so skinny. Don't worry, Dad. I'll get you back on your feet. Good job, Dr. Lee. A successful surgery. We'll only know after the patient wakes up. Excuse me. Please finish up. Why is he pouting after a successful surgery? He wanted to show Sun-woo how much he's grown, but Sun-woo seeing the torn artery might have hurt his pride. Cho-in idolizes Sun-woo. Lee Sun-woo! Did you come back only for that lousy surgery? You call yourself a neurosurgeon after tearing an artery? Forget it! I wrapped it back up with the skin from his head! Not anyone can think of doing that! I did that in my fourth year! Start over as an intern! What was that? Sun-woo, if I win, give me all your cards. You can't beat me, kiddo. I'm not losing this time. With those short legs? Sun-woo! Lee Sun-woo! Sun-woo! Sun-woo! Lee Cho-in. I missed you so much. I thought you died or something! I'm alive and safely back as you can see. Don't pat me on the head. I'm not a kid anymore. Sure, kiddo. You'll always be my little brother. Have you seen a kid over 6 feet tall? Sure, you've grown up. I was always taller than you. Disappear on me again, and you won't be my big brother anymore. Understood? Yes. Got it. Sun-woo! -Come on. -I said hi to him earlier. Dad, Sun-woo's back home. Your ungrateful son who vanished for the last seven years, Lee Sun-woo! Mr. Lee Jong-min, get up and let him have it, huh? We now have the best neurosurgeon from Johns Hopkins with us. So you've got nothing to worry about. Sun-woo and I will get rid of that chordoma of yours. Aren't you proud of your two sons? -I think he's smiling. -Maybe. You want to sleep next to him tonight? -My son. -Mom. I missed you. What do you think you're doing? You're a neurosurgeon, you know his condition. I'm sorry, Mother. I never said you could call me mother. Mom. You must be tired. Let's go home. Wait, okay? Mom! It'd be nice to have dinner with Cho-in on a day like today. You still hate him? No, I never liked him to begin with. Mom. Your father brought him against my will. He's responsible for the rift between us and your father. No matter what anybody says... Cho-in is my one and only brother. Your dad never showed you any warmth since he joined us. Call me petty, but I'll never embrace him. Amazing. See that, Dad? Scans of the patient Sun-woo operated on. Unbelievable. He'll get rid of your chordoma just like that. You're a lucky man, sir. Dad... I wish mother's hatred toward me was like your disease. Then Sun-woo and I can cure you both. Right? LEE SUN-WOO Dr. Sun-woo Lee. You have to become a good doctor and fix my heart, okay? Jung-min. I never thought you would come back, but what perfect timing. Did you know about it? You didn't know Seo-yeon's first concert is tomorrow? Ms. Choe Yu-rah is doing well. She's showing no neurological symptoms. -No other problems? -None at all. Make a fist. Tighter. Make a fist. Tighter. One more time. Dr. Lee Cho-in. Hi, Sun-woo. What are you doing? Sorry for not consulting the primary physician. Just admiring your amazing skills, Dr. Lee. Is that okay? Of course. So did you learn anything? She doesn't have her sense of taste yet. Is it because it's only been a day after surgery? No, she may never regain it. What? Her brain tumor was spread out to both the olfactory and gustatory cortexes. -Still-- -About the decision to remove more to prevent recurrence? The only question is how much to remove. But still... Sometimes you give up a bit to gain more. Is that the Johns Hopkins way? No, it's my way. Satisfied? Mister, how long will you sleep? You can't die on me after what I went through. I saved your brain artery. I heard you're homeless. Get up and go see your family. Please get up. SEO-YEON KIM SEO-YEON KIM Thank you. I feel nervous as if this was my concert. Let me introduce my songwriter and the star of this concert, Kim Seo-yeon! Like many others, I've had some tough years. I was born with a congenital heart condition. There was this person who... watched over me. Without him, I wouldn't be here. A preemie whose mom died in childbirth. Born in an incubator, yet never complained of pain. A man who swallowed his own sadness to show me nothing but his smile. A man who never forced me to choose and who waited 25 years for me. Now, it's my turn to answer him. Lee Cho-in. How could I not love such a man? You waited so long for this answer. I love you. I love you, honey. Spending all day thinking of you Falling asleep thinking of you Thinking of you first thing when I wake up Those are the easiest things to me I wonder if you are fine and where you are at I ask myself how you are doing. I love you, I love you Even when I cry I miss you, I miss you I'm still waiting for you When tomorrow comes And the day after I will be still missing you I will only love you Here. How was it? How was what? Oh, the concert? It was alright. It was the best! It was you after all. Kim Seo-yeons' concert today was the bomb! I accepted your proposal and you're keeping this up? -Give it up. -What? The thing in your left pocket. You've carried it for five years now. You knew? Thanks. For what? For everything. Like what? For not loving someone else. For loving me. Lee Cho-in, you do know that you're my favorite person in the world, right? Now and forever. Thanks... for waiting. "Dr. Lee Sun-woo performs surgery in the sky" It's plastered everywhere. This should appeal to the emergency meeting. We can't be overconfident. Most of the trustees are on the director's side. Don't worry. I'm starting to win them over. Dr. Lee! Take a look at the bulletin board. The Neurosurgery Center matter's going well? Of course. I'll operate under that assumption. I'm the newly appointed trustee Lee Sun-woo. This might take you by surprise, but as a trustee and Head Researcher of Neurosurgery, I would like to make a proposal. I propose that we build a Neurosurgery Center. How about the Emergency Center the Director wanted? Do you know what our losses were in the last fiscal year? We've been in the hole for eight years. Building an emergency center might cause a bigger loss. Thanks to the article about Dr. Lee Sun-woo, we saw a 300% increase in patients requesting treatments. Isn't this a reflection of the fact that Bosung's survival depends on specializing in neurosurgery? -As the Chief of Neurosurgery-- -May I interrupt? It sounds like we're only out there to make money. Dr. Kim, that's not what I meant-- Our motto is: "Saving a life always comes first." Am I wrong? No matter how noble our purpose may be, if our hospital closes its doors, how can we fulfill that goal? So what's the deal with the new Emergency Center? How is it different from the current ER? Well... let me make this simple. It won't be just an ER in the hospital. Think of it as a hospital within a hospital. Kind of a one-stop service system. Specialists from all departments will be assigned in the Emergency Center. We'll provide independent medical service without delays. And at times, we'll perform emergency surgeries. So we'll have our own surgery and in-patient facilities. We'll be able to spend more time saving patients. The quality of medical service may be more important. An Emergency Center may save some time, but won't we give up quality? No, that's not the case. Were you aware that the ER performed a successful surgery on a patient with almost the same conditions as the one Dr. Lee Sun-woo operated? How dare you perform such risky surgery in the ER? You should've transferred it to Neurosurgery! We wanted to, but at the time, the entire Neurosurgery was on call for Dr. Lee Sun-woo's surgery. So who performed this surgery? Dr. Lee Cho-in, transferred from Neurosurgery. Because he happened to be in the ER, we were able to save that patient's life. Isn't Dr. Lee Cho-in's surgery a winning argument for an Emergency Center, Vice-Director? We seem to have many different opinions. Why don't we put this to vote in five days? They seem to be pushing Cho-in to be the next director. How many votes are we behind? I had won over three more trustees. So we had the support of 8 out of the 14, but thanks to Cho-in's surgery, the Medical School Dean seems to have changed his mind. If this goes to vote, we'll surely go down! Forget the Neurosurgery Center. The hospital itself will go to Lee Cho-in. You have to take some measures. Chordoma? Scans of chordoma patients I operated at Johns Hopkins. I brought them because they were similar to dad's case. Here, extended sub-frontal base and extreme lateral approaches. That's a plan. The method mentioned in your dissertation? Indeed. It's the only way to remove tumors from a chordoma. We'll approach it from the prefrontal lobe, and remove the clivus tumor. No, that's too risky. What's risky about it? If we try to remove all the tumors, we don't know how Dad will end up. Then do we leave some of the tumors and open up his brain again? At least the complications will be reduced. Lee Cho-in... I've performed over 2,000 brain surgeries in the last 7 years. I've also published a dissertation on chordoma, which was accepted all over the world. My method has a 92.5% success rate. And what if he turns up like Choe Yu-rah? What was that? This is about Dad. Let's look for some other ways. Bye. We have the X-rays of Kim Sang-bong. His ribs are fractured, in the left 4, 5 and 6. A case of pneumothorax. Collapsed lung from the fractured ribs. Should we call Cardiovascular Surgery? Can't you see that the patient is in pain? It would be absurd if the ER can't insert a chest tube. -Get ready. -Yes, doctor. Lee Cho-in. Hey, Sun-woo. Would you believe me if you see it with your own eyes? A colleague named Jeffrey, my study's co-author, is going to perform surgery at a conference in China. You'll see how accurate my method is. Go to China. Really? So you leave tomorrow? Yes. Since the chordoma surgery is in two days. I see. Do you remember what you have tomorrow? Yes, Dr. Lee, I have a regular check-up tomorrow. Don't cry just because I won't be there. Have a safe trip. Oh, by the way... -honey-- -Your laundry is piled up? Thanks, babe. An emergency. I have to go. GENIUS DOCTOR PERFORMS SURGERY IN THE SKY Taking all those meds to pay for your flight to China? Come on, I didn't take that many. Take some more antitussive and betadine. -Really? -Yes, but come back right away after the chordoma surgery. We have the board meeting on Friday. Don't worry, doctor. And can I take some more painkillers? He should be back on the day of our board meeting. God gave us this chance. He must not come back. His absence alone will affect the trustees. It'll seem like he's not very interested in the Emergency Center. Will you recruit more trustees to our side? Got any connections in China? I've already made arrangements. Trustworthy? You can't trust people, but you can trust money. People can even kill for money. For the right price, it can be done. Sure. Long time no see. I saw you yesterday. Wait for your turn today. Come on, we go way back. Okay, one more. Make it quick. Gentlemen! That many? You're putting me in a bind. Not after you took the money, buddy. Come on, gentlemen! Hurry! Come here! You have to come back, gentlemen. -Thanks, Young-ji. -Goodbye. Young-ji... only because you're so pretty. Thank you. Call me if you come to Korea. Sure thing. Thank you. Goodbye. Take care. Why, those jerks. After groping me... Man, what idiots. Who are you? Oh, Young-ji? I'm not Korean. No way, you're asking me to be a spy. This guy is a hustler on the run. All you have to do is stay with him and report to us. I still can't do it. I don't even know who he is. Man... Can you make this much in a month being a guide? You can't, can you? And when the job is done, I'll throw in another 10,000 yuan. Well? Mr. Lee Cho-in! MR. LEE CHO-IN Mr. Lee Cho-in from Seoul! Are you Mr. Lee Cho-in? Yes, I'm Lee Cho-in. Lee Cho-in has been intercepted... Lee Cho-in, you hustler... I'm not letting you out of my sight. Mr. Lee! Thanks for coming. I never left you. I did hurt you, but I never left you, not even for a moment. Where's that jerk Lee Cho-in! Mr. Lee just doesn't seem like a bad guy. -Ouch. -Hurting? None of your business. You're not okay until I say that you are! Take care of him as you see fit. Did you kidnap Lee Cho-in? Don't let him come back to Korea. For good.
