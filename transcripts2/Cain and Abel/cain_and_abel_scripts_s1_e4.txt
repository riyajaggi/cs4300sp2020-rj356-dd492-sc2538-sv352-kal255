 What? Are you crazy? You're getting the wrong idea. I want to check your heart. How is it? You have a rapid heartbeat, but I give you permission. Keep warm. One more thing. I love you. Lee Cho-in. Tell me this isn't the last place you saw. TWO MONTHS LATER We've been through many trials and tribulations. But we finally have our day. We announce the construction of the Neurosurgery Center. Bravo! BOSUNG HOSPITAL NEUROSURGERY CENTER Congratulations! Sun-woo, you did it. Thanks, Jung-min. Too bad Cho-in couldn't be here. Is Seo-yeon still in China...? Dr. Lee, you've been through so much. Thank you. I'll run the Neurosurgery Center, so you can go find Cho-in. Hello, Dr. Park. You still haven't gotten rid of Jo Hyun-taig? He came around to our side after your father's surgery. I'll let him serve out his term. No. You must terminate his contract of employment now. No, Kim Hyun-ju has to go first. We can still use Jo Hyun-taig. I will handle the personnel decisions. Leave it to me. Now I should go say hello. Here. It's not a big deal. It just slipped. Welcome. Congratulations. Good to see you. Does he really want to live like that? Talk about annoying! Jo Hyun-taig is... He's standing there with that smile. I can't beat up an older colleague... It's been two months already. Yes. Sun-woo is supposedly looking for him, but who knows anymore...? Just imagine if the Director could see. It's a drag having to check on him every day. He stares at me with those eyes. It feels like he's asking me where Cho-in is. I can't face him. Where did this kid disappear to? Mr. Lee Sun-woo. You requested a CT scan. Do you have a prior medical history? Seven years ago, I had a prefrontal tumor It was removed at Johns Hopkins Hospital. You want to see if there's a recurrence? Soy milk and snacks. Hello. I'll take two. That'll be a buck. Thank you. Come on, people. Ouch, I burned myself. Are you okay? I burned my hand. When you burn yourself, pour cold water on the wound. And wrap it with a clean cloth. Like this? Thanks. It's just common sense. Thanks. If you get burnt by oil, pour cold water on the wound. And wrap it with a moist cloth. Hello? Young-ji, this is Mr. Mah. How are you, Mr. Mah? Did anyone come to see you? No... Anyone come by your place? I've been out since then. Is something up? Some North Koreans came to see me. North Koreans? Your brother Oh Kang-chul must have fled the country. They're looking for you and your brother. Take care, Young-ji. We'll take one. I said, I want one. What did you say? I don't understand. You are not Chinese? Oh Young-ji! Idiots, you can't even grab a chick? Sorry, sir! She must have not met up with Oh Kang-chul yet. Search around Oh Young-ji's place. Did you find where Oh Kang-chul is dealing? Yes, we did. Let's move. Comrade. Is Oh Kang-chul so dangerous that we all have to go? He's just a drug dealer. He may seem like that now. But he's one of the top graduates from the Russian Military Academy. He made all our arms smuggling routes in Africa and Europe. He was definitely in line for a high government post. He might be on a roll only if his parents hadn't been accused of reactionary. He's that important? He is. What if he meets up with the South Koreans or the CIA? He can destroy all our drugs and arms routes. For the sake of our nation, we must find this traitor. We must! Help me... I knew you'd do that, knucklehead! What are you doing? Are you all right? What's wrong with you? Did you see what he was doing? Helping the guy who was shooting at us! Is that true? I asked you if it's true. Why even bother asking him? Who the heck are you, jerk? Who are you? Stop playing dumb. Answer me! Will a bullet in the head help you remember? Okay, I'll blow your brains out. I don't remember... I don't remember anything... Not even my name or who I was... So what am I supposed to say? Shoot me. I don't care where, in my head or in my heart... Help me remember. Maybe I'll remember when I'm dead. So just shoot me! Shoot! Kill me now! Sure, right away. I'll kill you! Sir... Have you seen this person? No. Have you seen this person? No, I haven't. Have you seen this person? No. You know what? Maybe Cho-in disappeared with that woman? Maybe he got tired of me. After all, my heart will last maybe another ten years. Maybe he disappeared without saying goodbye? You know Cho-in would never do that. I never thought you'd do that to me. Why did you stop getting in touch with me seven years ago? Was there another woman? Or were you tired of me? Why did you cut me off? When someone goes missing, the person waiting is such a nervous wreck. Why don't I hear from Cho-in? You must know why, so tell me. Is Gi-seok okay? He keeps bleeding. He'll soon experience hypovolemic shock. Now the clown is even speaking English. Jerk... He could die from blood loss! Comrade Oh, where are we going? We'll drop off Gi-seok and get some medicine. How? By attacking a Chinese hospital? If that's what it takes. Have you lost your mind? Do you know how much ice we're carrying? Ten kilos. If we're caught, we'll get a life sentence. Should we all die to save one life? So what should we do? Comrade Oh, it's too late for Gi-seok. We'll let him go and divvy up the drug money. Listen here, Choi Chi-soo. You gave up your country for money? Is that all you care about? Yes, money talks for me. I have to bring my wife and kids I left behind. You have no idea what I'm saying as your sister's out of the country already. So you'll sell out a dying comrade? He's going to die anyway. Don't be so high and mighty. Sir... Choi Chi-soo, I still happen to be your superior. Which means that I, Oh Kang-chul, have the final say in the matter. You better follow my orders. If not, I'll kill you myself even before Gi-seok dies. Got it? Yes... Seo-yeon. Kim Seo-yeon. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PERSON LEE CHO-IN? PROGRAPH Hello? Seo-yeon, where are you? We'll bring back some medicine. I'll look after Gi-seok. Hey... I don't want to die... I have to make money and send it to my mom... Hey... PHARMACY Comrade Oh. It's all in Chinese, so I can't tell. Just get everything that looks similar. Yes, sir. The pharmacy! Hi. Can you help me hold the other side? Seo-yeon. Cho-in's pictures are getting wet. He won't be recognizable. Help me. Look after yourself first. Keep this up an you'll collapse before you find him! When did you stop taking the meds? It's time that you stop this madness! Enough! No, I can't. Cho-in gave me his everything... And I'm just starting to... It's only recently that I told him I love him. So I can't give him up now. He gave me this heart. It was him... So I would never give up. Never! You can go. I can do this all by myself. Kim Seo-yeon. MISSING PERSON LEE CHO-IN Seo-yeon. Ambulance! You're going to die anyway. How's Gi-seok? He just passed away. I tried to save him with the ice. Don't make a fuss. Let him die in peace. Why, you idiot... Sir... He's alive. I need defibrillators. For the heart, you mean? There wouldn't be any here. Defibrillators! Please wait outside. Can you wait outside? Don't worry, sir, I'll do it. Defibrillators. Don't worry. Hurry! Ventricular fibrillation... Stronger! Everyone, move back. His heart's beating again. Not yet, he needs surgery. Thank you for staying alive. Thank you... What's going on? I thought he had amnesia? He seemed to act unconsciously. He probably learned it all by iterative process. Just like we kill a man unconsciously, he saves a life unconsciously. He's probably a great doctor from South Korea. Call me if you need anything. Kim Seo-yeon. Seven years ago... at the time I cut you off... Did you look for me like this, too? Why did you save me in the desert? You could've just left me there. I didn't save you. I unconsciously saved your hand that reached out for me. Just as you unconsciously saved Gi-seok. Sir. Who do you think I was? You're able to talk now. So I think you will get your memory back soon. Maybe your magic hands will bring back it all back quickly. Thank you... I owe you one. Do you really think I'll get my memory back? Mr. Lee, this is Oh Young-ji. Did you make it safely back to Korea? I... I'm doing fine, too. My surgical wound is almost healed. And my constipation is better too. Do you want to know what's good about constipation? You feel alive when you poo. Mr. Lee, I'll call again later. Goodbye. Take care. They just won't stop. Have you seen this, Dr. Kim? Seen what? The ethics committee is calling you in for questioning. Take a look. What have you done to deserve this? Improper removal of medication? I think they want you to stop the Emergency Center project. Right? The ethics committee hearing has been set. Can we get rid of Kim Hyun-ju just for this small issue? We added a few more missing items to the list. When it concerns antipsychotic medications, even Kim Hyun-ju can't avoid her liability. Yes? Ma'am, the Director's attorney is here. The Chief of our legal department? No, a personal attorney. Show him in. I am here to see the Vice-Director, Nah Hae-ju? Yes, have a seat. I'm a private attorney representing the Director, Lee Jong-min. He left this in my care. What is it? It's a registration of ownership transfer with regards to the new upcoming Medical Center. What? A REGISTRATION OF OWNERSHIP TRANSFER ASSIGNER: LEE JONG-MIN ASSIGNEE: LEE CHO-IN STATEMENT OF WILL It indicates clearly that the Director, Lee Jong-min, has had the forthcoming Medical Center registered in the name of his son, Lee Cho-in. SIGNED BY LEE JONG-MIN Cho-in... Hello? The item is fine. You know what to do next. Look at you, fully recovered in just three days! Eat some of this, too. No, thanks. Where do you want to meet? Sure. Are you sure that's the location? You just heard me. All right, man, it's your funeral tomorrow. Oh Kang-chul, the traitor. How did it go? Tomorrow at two at the mahjong room. Then we'll be set from tomorrow? Yes. So can we splurge on some meat tonight? Meat? We've been roaming from forest to desert. Let's have a good meal. Yes, why not? Let's dine off some meat tonight. Really? Look at you. Being on the run has made you look terrible. I'm fine. But ma'am... Have you heard anything from my brother? Nothing yet. Don't worry, I'll let him know. Well, you don't have to do that anymore. Why, are you moving on? Are you going to South Korea, too? I can't just wait here forever. I have enough money to sneak onto a boat. I'm going to take the chance. If you see my brother... Please tell him that I waited for him. Tell him to come to Korea because I'll wait for him there. Please. I will. I have his picture. I'll tell him you waited forever for him. Young-ji, don't get caught or die... Live and have a good life. I will. Young-ji... Don't worry. Okay. We got some meat! Wherever you go, call me. You're not eating. Help yourself to the meat. With this meat... my mom and siblings could stuff themselves for ten days. But you fled the country. She's already been dragged off to jail. Hey. I was just speaking the truth. Don't worry. We sell the ice tomorrow. Then you can send money to your mom and siblings. For real, sir? Is that your family? My younger sister. My only blood. Isn't she pretty? Yes, she is. Yes, she is. She's like a flower, like a star... I wanted to flee with her and show her a better world. Don't worry. You will get everything back, too. Your loved ones and your memories... Thank you. For what? For saving my life. I left North Korea with a cousin. He was floating away after he got shot because of me, but I couldn't hold on to his hand. The other day, I said your hands might save you. When your hand reached out for me in the desert... I felt like my dead cousin's hand was touching me. We should go. He looks dead. Let's move. Here. Drug dealers always put their lives at risk. It will be a crucial moment for you and I tomorrow. I don't want to lose anyone else. Protect your life. And until you regain your memory... Be my little brother. Good. From now on, you will be Oh Kang-ho. Oh Kang-ho...? I'll take four pickles. Go to the second floor. Boss. You... I read my fortune for today. And this is what I got. China has lost. The dragon shall leave. It's a set up. I don't know who I am. What I'm supposed to do. I have no clue. The smiling man in the picture... Was that really me? Or someone who just looks like me? What do you mean Cho-in is alive? Sun-woo went to look for him. Lee Cho-in is alive! So have you confirmed that he's Lee Cho-in? He's not my brother.
