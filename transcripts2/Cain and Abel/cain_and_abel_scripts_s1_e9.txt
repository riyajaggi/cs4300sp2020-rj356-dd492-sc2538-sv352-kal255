 Why are you doing this? Young-ji, out of my way... Mr. Oh! Please stop. You're scaring me. What has this person done? Go. Hurry up! Do you know who he is? Your brother... Kang-chul was killed by this man. Mr. Oh. Still, don't do this. Even if he did kill my brother...

 Don't do this. You aren't a killer. Kang-chul... ...didn't save... ...your life for this. Not for you to become a murderer... Young-ji. I know. I know how you feel. I hate that man so much I could kill him myself. But still... If you commit murder and go away, too... Then I... I'd have no one. In all of South Korea... There's no one who'd care for me. So please... Have pity on me. And please don't do this. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Oh... Is that your family? My younger sister. Isn't she pretty? Yes, she is. I wanted to flee with her and show her a better world. So you know what happened to my brother Cho-in? I certainly do. So what exactly happened to Cho-in? How could it be that after having his funeral... ...we're hearing that he might be alive? He supposedly lost his memory, took on the name Oh Kang-ho, escaped prison and is trying to come to Korea. Some even say they saw him. If that's true... Someone sent what was supposed to be his ashes. Along with his ring. So you must be here because you heard the same rumor. Yes, that's right. That's good. Then will you look for Cho-in? I'll make it your worthwhile. Sure, we'll do that. Then I'll put my faith in you. Boss, what's this about Lee Cho-in being alive... Be quiet. If he is alive, we'll find him and get paid. Either way, this Lee Cho-in is a jackpot for us. Young-ji. Thank you. For what? For saving my hand... I saved a wounded comrade in the desert without thinking. And Kang-chul said that I may have been a doctor. That this hand might help me regain my memory. Thank you for protecting it. Mr. Oh, you know what? That hand saved my life, too. Young-ji, why don't we leave? What do you mean? You want to move? Yes. Choi Chi-soo will come back for sure. Then I won't be able to let him leave in one piece. I want to keep my promise to you. That's good. I don't want you getting mixed up with him either. But where should we go? Anywhere you want to go is fine with me. Anywhere. Are you sure? Yes. Even if it's a bit far away from Seoul? Two tickets to Chong-ju, please. Thank you. FROM SEOUL TO CHEONGJU Oh Young-ji speaking. This is Cho-in's brother Lee Sun-woo. Oh, hello... We were supposed to meet here at the hospital. Something came up. I can go see you. Where are you? Mr. Lee Sun-woo I told you everything I know. I'm crazy busy trying to make ends meet. So please stop calling me. MR. LEE SUN-WOO Mr. Oh, the bus is leaving soon. I'll take it. An old habit from my tour guide days. Mr. Oh. Once we get on this bus, things may take a while. It may take a while for you to regain your memory. Are you okay with that? Yes. I'm fine. Don't be so quick to answer. Your people who you loved might be waiting for you. But you may not see them for a long while. You may... regret getting on this bus. I won't regret it. Ever. That's fine then. We better get on. This road I'm on may take me further away from my memories. The person who tried to kill me and the person I loved... I may not find them for a long time. But I still want to know why I was left for dead. And I still want to find out who I am that was lost with my memories. But I fear that if I do regain my memories, I won't be able to look after this woman sleeping next to me. They're kind of small today. These are a foot long. Keep shortchanging me, and I'll go somewhere else. You've become a businessman and fisherman. I'll give you two more bucks for each. Come on now. Give me three more. Fine, sell me this carp, too. Sir, that's not for sale. Saving it for your wife? Wife... Oh... Yes, it's for her all right. Sure, look after her. Don't regret it after you become a widower like me. My chest hurts from smoking too much. Well, that may not be the lungs. Do you have high blood pressure or diabetes? How did you know? You better go get yourself checked out. It's okay. Now you're playing doctor, too. Off I go. Kang-ho. Catch more fish for my big group tomorrow. And drop by and pick up that recorder. Sure thing. From Sung-an Travel Agency! From Sung-an Travel Agency. Come this way. Watch your step. Who did these? Cho-in's drawings? He was so good with his hands. He was such a quick study. LEE SUN-WOO You're not going to get it? Sun-woo, this is Jung-min. Seo-yeon won't answer. You've been avoiding his calls for a month. Isn't it time you let it go? Doesn't packing Cho-in's things mean you're ready for Sun-woo? They're separate issues. You two were so lovey-dovey before he left to study. Have you forgotten that? Or are you pretending? Yes, once upon a time, he was the only man for me. He meant the world to me. Then he vanished for seven years and came back out of the blue. And he says that he still loves me. How would you take that? You chose Cho-in in Sun-woo's place. No. No offense to Cho-in who looked after me for seven years. But if Sun-woo had asked, I might have waited. Seven years or 70 years... That's how much I loved him. But I can't trust anyone now. Cho-in or Sun-woo... I don't want to start anything with people who just vanish. This mansion is where Korean presidents stay during vacation. Follow me. This is the study room. Take a look around. This is the living room. Kang-ho, did you catch lots of fish? I sure have, Comrade Young-ji. Where are you at? I'm at the rock statue park. Stop making fun of my accent. That's my next stop on the tour, so don't have lunch alone. This park has rock sculptures of those who changed history. French president De Gaulle, Russian president Lenin, and England's Prince Charles. Feel free to take photos. -Can we get a photo? -Sure. Comrade Oh Young-ji. Stop talking so much or you'll get a sore throat. You eat up, Comrade Kang-ho. I don't like oily food. I know there was only one egg left in the fridge. It's not about that. Then we split it, okay? Thanks. Is that a new statue? Yes. I have to remember so much as it is. But they keep bringing in new ones. So who is that American guy? He's not American but Austrian. Austria... Yes. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. And he's a classical composer. The next guy is Giacomo Puccini. The greatest Italian composer of the opera after Verdi. How do you know all that? No kidding. How do I know that? Strange. Maybe your memory has come back. Has it? I don't think so. My memory hasn't come back. It's all written on there. I didn't say anything. I don't know what's in that head of yours. But you get these headaches and act spaced out. You can do that around me. But you might get hurt somewhere else. So should I just do that around you? Is that supposed to be a joke? The tourists are finishing up their lunch. Okay, it's time to go home. -Ready? -Bye, bye, bye! Bye! Miss Kim. We don't have anyone for the medical show-and-tell. Sorry? Well, Dr. Lee Cho-in can't come any more. I'll take care of it. I practically lived in a hospital after all. Thank you, Miss Kim. LEE JUNG-MIN Any progress? Of course, we have some good news. As you said, this Oh Kang-ho is in Korea. We found out that he was in the orientation center. We're not certain that he's the same person as Lee Cho-in. Keep looking into it. Boss, this Lee Sun-woo is a bit strange. Why doesn't he just go to the police instead of hiring us? Who knows how these fat cats think? We'll just find this Lee Cho-in or Oh Kang-ho jerk and get paid. To this orientation center. Let's go make some cash. Yes, sir. You had a long day, rest up. See you tomorrow. Comrade Young-ji. What brings you here? Is everything okay? I came to escort you, my lady. Let's go. Faster, Comrade Kang-ho. Yes, ma'am. Big brother! Mr. Oh, you're calling for your brother. Do you remember his name? -Brother! -Mr. Oh. We'll stop today's session. How am I doing? You can't remember what happened before the shooting. You must be really afraid of the man who shot you. But don't feel down. You've made a lot of progress in the last three sessions. You should regain your memory soon. Are the headaches still bad? Yes. I'll prescribe one week's worth of meds. Don't let the headaches stop you from remembering. Doctor, can't you give me two weeks' worth of meds? I can't afford to come often. Sure. Comrade Kang-ho, where the heck are you? I'm on my way. But there's a huge traffic jam. What the heck is a jam? Too many cars on the road. I'll fly over. Disassociative amnesia... Able to remember everything else but one's identity... It's what Mr. Oh has... I'm going to lose it, what took you so long? I wanted to help you sell some potato dumpling soup. But the customers are irate from waiting. Sorry, I got backed up. Come on. It's probably ruined by now. I'm sorry. Do you know what this Saturday is? Saturday? Are you really Young-ji's cousin? I am. So you made a life-or-death escape with Kang-chul, and can't remember your only living relative's birthday? Birthday? I'll let it go since she insists you're her cousin. But you better not like her. Make her cry, and I'll make you pay. Give her a hard time, and... Got that? Stop smiling. Get going. Okay. Birthday? Look at the time. You go on deliveries and just vanish. Sorry, it took me a while. We put all of our stipend into this business. We won't even break even at this rate. Don't worry, I'll work my butt off. I'll finish up, go take a break. I'm fine! You're not even wearing gloves. Sit right here and wait. Comrade Kang-ho. Yes, my lady. Are you okay living like this? You go out fishing at dawn. Then you do hard labor all day. Then you make deliveries till two in the morning. Don't you get sick of it all? No, I enjoy it. I must have been born to live like this. I love it. So you'll be okay continuing to live like this? Even if you don't regain your memory? I'll regain it someday. Then you'll forget all about little old me. What? I couldn't remember your face, so I wanted to take another look. People in love can't get enough of looking at each other. Maybe I love you? Stop teasing me. Oh my, love my foot! Oh? Don't you worry, I won't ever forget you. Yes, please don't ever forget me. I wish that you'll never regain your memory. You don't even have to love me. But I want to keep living with you like now. Did Jung-min call you? It's the only way I could see you, so I made the call. Let's go inside. So this is called a stethoscope... And when I wear it and listen... I can hear your heartbeat as if it's thunder. So everyone... When you have a cold... I'd use the stethoscope... And listen to your heart... One second. Shall we try it? Shall we? Please wait. We made $1,500 on top of the $3,000 in stipends. So we're rich. We've got a long way to go. I need $20,000 to bring my parents here. That much? I smuggled myself in here, but they should ride a plane. Don't you agree? Comrade Kang-ho, I'll treat today. Really? Yes, keep it under two bucks though. This is so good, isn't it? Sure, just great. Hey, I bought it for you as a big gesture. Give it here. I said it's great. Hey, you can't do that... What's going on? Mister. He must be a doctor. He's becoming conscious... Can someone call an ambulance? 911? A person has collapsed. Please hurry. Thank you. Can we talk? Another time. Bye. You still can't forgive me? I can wait as long as it takes. -But... -What more do you want? Don't you have everything you ever wanted? You're the Director of the new center, and soon you'll be the Director of the hospital, too. Is that not enough? If I throw all that away, can I win your heart? -Is everything so simple to you? -No. If you knew what I exchanged for the Neurosurgery Center... You wouldn't say that. But even that Neurosurgery Center... ...means nothing to me if I can't have you. -Sun-woo! -Don't! I'm fine! I'm fine... Don't come. Are you okay? Sun-woo, what's wrong? Sun-woo... Please wake up! Somebody help! Sun-woo was ill. He was seriously ill that he couldn't come back. Hi Seo-yeon. Jung-min, Sun-woo has collapsed. Where are you? In an ambulance. Remember what you told me in China? That Sun-woo was ill. What was his illness... Sun-woo. Are you okay? I'm fine. It happens about once a year when I'm too tired or anxious. How embarrassing. Are you sure? It's a passing thing, so don't worry. Sun-woo... Young-ji, are you sleeping? Why did you go off by yourself? You don't like me doing that, right? I'm not mad because you helped someone. But do you know how things are in Korea? If something goes wrong, they'll blame you for everything. Then the police will take you in and things will get complicated. I'm sorry. To be honest... I wish you wouldn't do things like that. I'll be more careful. Good night. I'm the one who should be sorry, but you keep apologizing. I'm the bad one here... THORACOTOMY-CAPABLE HOSPITALS IN 1980 Don't let the headaches stop you from remembering. You'll be in pain, but make a memo of everything. Whether they be names, places, or numbers. Something might come up within a few days. This session might stimulate something. 1115... This is Lee Cho-in, and I'm in surgery. I'll call you when I'm out. Scalpel. This is Lee Cho-in, and I'm in surgery. I'll call you when I'm out. Scalpel. This is Lee Cho-in. I'm in surgery. What's the status? He was in a bus that was in an accident. The umbrella got lodged in his stomach. One, two, three! Dressing cart. The bleeding is bad. Dr. Kim. What is it? A burn victim. Hook him up to a monitor and check the oxygen level. Someone give me a hand! I got it. Jin-geun? Long time no see, ma'am. I got it. Thanks. Black, right? Thank you. Look at you, Jin-geun. Becoming the Chief Anesthesiologist at the Neurosurgery Center has changed you. I was always a looker. Well, you're all bling-bling now. You must be busy though. I took out the time just for you. Really? There's actually an experiment here. So I volunteered to oversee it. Just to see you, ma'am. Good. Aren't you off tomorrow? Let's go on an overnight booze trip. Okay, I'll treat tonight. Okay... Mr. Oh, turn off the alarm... Mr. Oh, please... Young-ji, I have to go somewhere today. Don't wait up for me. More than 70 years before Gutenberg in Germany, Koreans had movable type printing. I love you. You can try now. Where are you? Why aren't you picking up? Text me when you get this. So what's good in Cheong-ju? Cheong-ju is known for jageuri. Jageuri? What's that? Looks a bit like you actually. To Cho-in? You want to give the hospital to Cho-in? The hospital isn't really anyone's to give away. Why not? I'm half responsible for this hospital's growth. I, Nah Hae-ju, made Bosung Medical Center! If we go by your logic, this hospital belonged to Cho-in's parents. So you want to give it back to Cho-in? Yes. Because he's really the son of you and his mother? Honey! You thought I didn't know? You pretend to have adopted your dead friends' son. But I've known that he's your son. My goodness... Fine, think whatever you want. And I'll build that Emergency Medical Center and have Cho-in become its Director. Why did your friend Lee Jin-sung and Cho-in's mother Choe Yun-hee die in an accident? What do you mean? Why did a perfectly fine car's brakes go bad? Don't tell me... Mr. Lee Jong-min. You should've repented before me for your sin. Then the love of your life wouldn't be dead. So you... You... If you'd just stopped with Cho-in's mother... None of this would've happened to you, Cho-in and our son Sun-woo. Young-ji, is Kang-ho getting some treatment? I saw him walk out of a psychiatric clinic. -Sun-woo! -Don't! I'm fine... Please wake up! Don't... Somebody help! Idiot... Lee Sun-woo speaking. Dr. Lee, this is Choe Bok-geun. I have some good news. Go on. Just as you had guessed, Oh Kang-ho is indeed Lee Cho-in. What? He was at the orientation center and managed to get out. Are you sure he's Lee Cho-in? Yes, positive. So where is he? I think he's in Cheong-ju. But I don't think he's by himself. What do you mean? Oh Young-ji... Find them. Whether it be Lee Cho-in or Oh Young-ji... Find them now!
