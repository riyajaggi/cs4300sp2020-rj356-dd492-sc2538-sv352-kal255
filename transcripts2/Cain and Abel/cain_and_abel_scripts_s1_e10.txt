 EPISODE 10 Just as you had guessed, Oh Kang-ho is indeed Lee Cho-in. So where is he? Where's Lee Cho-in? I think he's in Cheong-ju. Cheong-ju? A woman named Oh Young-ji took him there. Oh Young-ji... Find them. Whether it be Lee Cho-in or Oh Young-ji...

 Find them now! Yes, I will. LONG TERM CONTRACT Isn't Oh Young-ji the tour guide back in China? The one who hid him away. Oh Young-ji... The nerve of her! But we have them in our grasp. Cheong-ju is tiny compared to China. Man-ho, let's go to Cheong-ju. Yes, sir. PARK DAE-SEONG, CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST Doctor, I have a question. If my cousin Kang-ho regains his memory,

 will he forget everything happening now? You're referring to disassociative amnesia. Yes, disassociative amnesia. He can't seem to remember what happened to him, but seems to remember everything else. If that's what he has, we can't discount that possibility. Young-ji... Were you waiting for me? I'm so moved I could cry. Are you mad? Why would I be mad? But you are. Were you worried? You left a lousy note and didn't answer your phone all day. Wouldn't you be worried? Sorry, Young-ji. So you regret it already? THORACOTOMY-CAPABLE HOSPITALS IN EARLY 1980s You regret moving here so you're trying to regain your memory? You wanted to regain your memory that bad? So you just said to hell with all the promises you made me? Yes, I did. I'm sorry, Young-ji. But when I have these nightmares every night about being shot and begging for my life... I feel like going crazy. I wanted to know why they wanted me dead. So why do you want to know? You'll just be in more pain. Young-ji, don't talk that way. Even if they are bad memories, I want to regain them. And even if my memory does return, I will keep my promise of remaining as Oh Kang-ho to you. So try to understand. You say that now, but no one knows what one's thinking. If you regain your memory, you'll forget everything now and remember only the past. What do you mean? I checked on the internet and talked to the doctor. If you regain your memory... You'll forget Kang-chul, me, and everything here in Cheong- ju. Young-ji. Should I not regain my memory and live as Oh Kang-ho? Yes! Yes, I want that. I want you to live just as Oh Kang-ho. I'm sorry, Mr. Oh. I just want to be as important to you as you are to me. Jung-min, you have a medical degree. Sun-woo's seizure is related to his illness, right? Jung-min, want me to die out of frustration? What was Sun-woo's illness? It was an astrocytoma. Astrocytoma? It's a brain tumor. What... Most recurrences of astrocytoma are malignant. It could even be grade four. There must be a way, right? There's radiation treatment, but nothing's guaranteed. Then... Hope for the best, but... If it's a recurrence, he has two years at best. Lee Sun-woo... You jerk... You scumbag... Yes, I did. I'm sorry, Young-ji. When I have these nightmares every night about being shot and begging for my life... I feel like going crazy. I want you to live just as Oh Kang-ho. This is Lee Cho-in, and I'm in surgery. I want you to live just as Oh Kang-ho. This is Lee Cho-in, and I'm in surgery. Lee Cho-in! Oh Kang-ho! Lee Cho-in! You told me that Sun-woo was ill. What was his illness... Already time for the morning briefing... Can we talk? I'm sorry, but I have a briefing. -I'll call you later. -Want me to wait again? Until when? Isn't seven years of wasted time enough? How long will you hide it this time? How long! Kim Seo-yeon. Tell me when it recurred! -Is that important? -Lee Sun-woo. You're sick right now and you need me. You've come back a mess yet you're so proud. After seven years of no contact, you should have come back healthy. Or... You should have never contacted me. You have come back a broken man, yet you're so proud. "I'm ill." "I'm in so much pain, can you hold my hand?" Can't you just beg me to embrace you? Then you'd have my pity at least. No. I never even had the chance to get pity. I learned of the recurrence... ...only when Cho-in vanished in China. Seven years ago when I was sick, and when it recurred now... I wanted to cry... But no one was there for me. So I held up my head high... I had no choice but to pretend everything was okay. Ever since I was five years old... It's always been that way once Cho-in was adopted. I was never as sick as Cho-in was. I was never as praised as he was. Even after I became a doctor... We were always compared even though he's five years younger. And even as an adult... The only thing that distinguished me was that I was stricken with a potentially fatal condition. It was so sad. But I didn't want to feel sad. So I felt I had to hold my head up high and be proud. That's why you hid it all this time? Because of pride? After Cho-in's adoption... That was the only way I could get Dad's love and attention. What's so important about pride? So what if it's pity or compassion? You said you never forgot me. Then you should've told me to wait. My biggest regret in life is that I couldn't tell you back then. I'm sorry, Seo-yeon. DUMPLING HOUSE OPEN EVENINGS MR. OH KANG-HO So you'll be okay continuing to live like this? Even if you don't regain your memory? Is this the dumpling house? Mr. Oh, have you left already? For good? I never wanted to make you cry like this young girl. I just wanted to be happy with you like these kids. I'm just an idiot who can't even remember his name. But just as kids age year by year, I wanted us to make memories together little by little. Just as you turn into a lady day by day, I wanted us to grow together. I wanted to regain my memory and stick with you. Even if you and I were to grow fat like these people. Comrade Young-ji. Happy birthday, Comrade Young-ji. Mr. Oh, I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I thought that you left me for good. Because I'm a terrible person... Young-ji, you are not a bad person. I'm so grateful to you. Young-ji. I'll abide by your wishes. I won't try to regain my memory. You mean that? You really won't try to regain your memory? I won't. Thank you, Mr. Oh. Hey, you always call me Comrade Kang-ho. What's with this Mr. Oh stuff again? Young-ji. From now on... How about calling me Kang-ho? Okay, I'll do that. Kang-ho... Time to make a wish and blow out the candles. Mr. Oh... My wish has already come true. You didn't leave. What's this? Can I open it? It's makeup. I noticed you ran out. Thank you. So pretty. You like it? Yes, a lot. But it looks so expensive, where did you get the money? Don't worry about it. Want to try it on? Give me a minute. How do I look? Let's wait a while. I can find out who I am after Young-ji becomes happy. Cho-in. Sun-woo is... He's ill. He may never recover. So... For me and Sun-woo... Would you root for us? He's your brother that you so loved. Lee Cho-in. Let's meet in the next world. Mr. Oh! Come eat. Mr. Oh! THORACOTOMY-CAPABLE HOSPITALS IN EARLY 1980s Mr. Oh! Kang-ho, come have some breakfast. THORACOTOMY-CAPABLE HOSPITALS IN 1980 All set. -Check again. -Sure. Dr. Kang Seok-hoon? -Go ahead. -Okay. Yes, Miss Kim Seo-yeon. You know me? Of course I know you. Your smiling picture was always on Dr. Lee Sun-woo's desk. He probably endured all his pain and illness just to be healthy when he saw you. Even though it didn't work out. That's why I came to see you, Dr. Kang. You're here to ask about his condition? Yes. Be honest with me. Did you get some pictures? They came out great. So the only thing left is to get paid by Lee Sun-woo. Dr. Lee, this is Choe. Did you see the pictures? I'm looking at them right now. Should I go confirm that he's Lee Cho-in? No. I'll confirm it myself. You asked for me? I may be gone, possibly for a while. So do tomorrow's briefing with Dr. Kang. Yes, sir. Sun-woo. Are you free today? Mr. Lee Sun-woo. Going to turn down my first dating request in 7 years? Where should we go? I haven't been on one of these in so long. I used to think they were fast, but they're quite slow. You were young. And you were always cooped up in the hospital. So it must have felt fast. So you know where we're headed? I've always known. Seo-yeon, didn't you say you've never seen the sea? -Here. -What's this? The ticket to the sea. To the sea? Yes. This ticket can take you to the sea at any time. So this transplant has to go well. Then I'll take you to the sea. Really? Yes, have I ever lied to you? How long till we get to the sea? Just a bit more. -It's so stuffy. -Just leave it on. If you get a cold, we'll get caught for sneaking out. Okay. Thanks to that ticket you gave me, I mustered up the courage for that scary surgery. And thanks to that, I'm still alive. You were someone who could take me anywhere. My superman, my knight, and my prince. No, I was more grateful to you. For believing in me and receiving treatment. Sun-woo. Now will you believe in me and receive treatment? It's my turn to be your superman and knight. Believe in me and receive treatment, yes? Yes, I'll receive treatment. Then it's a promise. You'll be healthy again. Seo-yeon. Will you promise me something? No matter what I do to remain living by your side, will you be on my side? No matter what bad things I may do, if it's to stay by your side, will you believe in me till the end? Yes, I'll believe in you, Sun-woo. Excuse me, sir. Pardon me. Are you okay? Are you all right? By any chance... Do you know me? I've never seen you before. I'm sorry. Boss, I practically died. I thought he recognized you. If he does, we'll kill him and get more from Trustee Oh. If he doesn't, we'll just turn him over to Lee Sun-woo. Are you sure he didn't recognize you? He didn't seem to... Anyway, I guess Lee Sun-woo is not coming today. Something must've come up. What could be more important than finding his brother? Kang-ho. Did you have another nightmare? You're talking so much in your sleep. And all that cold sweat. I'll bring a towel. Young-ji. Wait. Stay here with me. Did something happen? No... I ran into someone... I don't even know him. I have no memories of him. He seemed familiar. But he frightened me. So much that I could hardly breathe. Everything will be fine now. I'll stay by your side, so don't worry and just get some rest. You've just been working too hard. Just take the day off tomorrow. And just rest at home, okay? It feels so warm. Is this what a mom's bosom feels like? Dr. Kang Seok-hoon told me. Why aren't you receiving radiation? Sun-woo. I was ready to give up treatment. What do you mean? I didn't want to go through that hell again. Sun-woo. But I feel different now, Mom. I really want to live now. I will live. That's right. You're my son. I'll get better... And I'll enjoy everything I couldn't before. As the Director Lee Jong-min's son... As the oldest child... As the Director of Neurosurgery Center... And as a certain woman's man... I'll enjoy all of my prerogatives. Yes, you do that. Enjoy all those things you couldn't before. Good morning, Dad. Did you sleep well? You don't have to try so hard. You can't ever get up again. Posttraumatic stress disorder? Yes, everything ranging from a natural disaster to an accident can be the cause. The attempt on Mr. Oh’s life must've set it off. And the amnesia could be a defense mechanism. So what will happen to my cousin? Treatment won't be so easy. If this continues he may fall into depression and have a hard time adjusting to society. This next track was written by the songwriter Kim Seo-yeon. And she sang this song herself. It contains words of a heartbreaking romance. Here's "Tomorrow." And I told him to take the day off. -You're here. -I told you to take the day off. But I have to make money. Have a seat for a second. -Try it. -What is it? I added some shepherd's purse in the potato dumpling soup. Have some. Isn't it good? It is. So should I put it on the menu? Sure. Okay. Thank you for calling. What would you like? One order of chicken, two orders of dumpling soup. And what else? What do you think? Isn't that your brother Lee Cho-in? How's his memory? Does he think that he's Oh Kang-ho? Yes, but he seems to have regained some memory. It's a little iffy. So do you want to take him back now? Let me confirm it myself and call you. Have you confirmed that he's him? Mr. Choe Bok-geun. You want the money, don't you? Well, I finished the job after all, so... Then go finish up what you were paid to do in China. Pardon? What do you mean... I'm saying... Take care of Cho-in's corpse first. Lee Cho-in, you should've never returned from China. This woman... Who is she... Who was she? So did Lee Sun-woo just tell us to kill his brother? Will you really kill him? Killing him is easy enough. DUMPLING HOUSE OPEN EVENINGS Too easy. Let's go, Man-ho. I'm back! Young-ji! Kang-ho, close up and go home. Let's call it a night. Young-ji, you've already had three bottles. Don't worry, I'm fine. This is nothing compared to the North Korean stuff. Something happened, so talk to me. What happened? Feel free to tell me. Jin-ho. Go on. There was something I really wanted. And then one day... it just fell from the sky, right into my lap. From the sky? Yes. It was like a miracle. Then is it okay for me to keep it? Did it not belong to anyone? Well, it did belong to someone. Then you have to return it. Right? I have to return it. No matter how much I wanted it. Yes, after all we went through a lot to get here. We can't do bad things. If it's not yours, you must return it, right? It's late, your cousin must be waiting. I'll clean up here, so get ready. I'll see you off. I know... I know it too well myself. But I didn't want anything to happen to him... That's why we ran away together. No... It's all a lie. I just wanted to keep him to myself. I just wanted to hide him for myself. I wanted him all to myself. I have nothing in this lonely world... I just wanted to have someone to lean on. I just wanted to stay by Mr. Lee Cho-in's side. You're up already? I didn't think you'd be up after drinking so much. I hardly drank. What are you doing? We're going on a picnic. What about work? You can't just work. You have to play, too. Get ready, Kang-ho. Okay, but can we stop by for my fish delivery? Sure. Sir, I brought the fish! Sir! Sir! Sir! Wake up! Sir! Acute myocardial infarction. You should help him get on the path to his memory. If that path is closed, his posttraumatic stress disorder may worsen. Why aren't you treating him? You can't just watch as a man is dying. Call an ambulance. I'm calling from a seafood restaurant in Dae-cheong Lake. Put me on the phone. Hello? Is percutaneous coronary intervention possible? Then take him somewhere with thrombolytic therapy. -What's the status? -Myocardial infarction. He has high blood pressure and diabetes. This gentleman helped at the scene. -Have this kid looked at. -What's wrong with him? I think it's a case of pan-peritonitis. This patient couldn't breathe on his own, right? -What is it? -Myocardial infarction, we suspect. Do a blood test and prepare for a PCI. Yes, Dr. Kim. Lee Cho-in? Lee Cho-in! Big brother! Hello? Excuse me... But would you happen to know me? My name is Lee Cho-in. Would you happen to know me? I'm Lee Cho-in.
