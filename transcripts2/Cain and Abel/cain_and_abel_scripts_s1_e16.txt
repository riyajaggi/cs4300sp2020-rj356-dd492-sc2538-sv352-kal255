 Dad. I can't forgive Sun-woo. Even if the patient dies, the surgery is a success because you removed all the tumors? Is that the theory behind your center? Dr. Lee Cho-in, do you have data to back up your accusation? The director of the Bosung Medical Center, Lee Jong-min. Didn't you operate on him? What do you want me to do? Case conference. Case conference.

 I'll do it for you. EPISODE 16 MY HEART Hi, Seo-yeon. Today? All right. I'll be there. Yes, Dr. Lee. Young-ji, I'll be late today. You must be busy. I'm okay, so take your time. No, I have a dinner appointment. I see... Then enjoy your dinner. I'll be back soon.

 Make sure to call me if you go anywhere. Okay? All right. Have a nice time. You look so pretty... I'm sorry, guys. Hi. Kim Seo-yeon, you look really pretty tonight. What's the special occasion? Well, we haven't had a meal together since you came back. I just wanted to talk to you about how you've been, and if you got your memories back at all. I see. Thanks. You should thank Sun-woo. There he is. Young-ji's here, too. Young-ji. Dr. Lee. Everyone looks surprised. Young-ji, have a seat. You're throwing me a homecoming party? I'm moved to tears. This is also a welcome party for Young-ji. So don't take all the glory. We have a lot to celebrate tonight. Yes, we do. We'll have more things to celebrate. Young-ji, you always look cheerful. So you don't look like a defector. Really? When Cho-in was missing, I went to the defector prison camp in China. They looked so sad and pitiful. You even went to a defector prison camp to look for me? Yes. With Sun-woo. You did? Then you must've walked around the entire camp. No, I had collapsed because of my heart. Sun-woo walked around by himself afterwards. But he couldn't find you. I didn't know Seo-yeon and my brother searched even the defector prison camp to find me. I didn't find my brother I was looking for there. There were just some defected soldiers and an amnesia patient. Aren't you two getting a little too tense? Why don't we enjoy our dinner altogether with Young-ji? I'm all right. By the way, Dr. Lee Sun-woo said earlier that we'll have more reasons to celebrate? I was going to say this when the time was right. Seo-yeon and I... we are getting married. Sun-woo. No way, Kim Seo-yeon. I'm against this marriage. Cho-in. Who are you to oppose our marriage? Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not asking for your permission. Sun-woo, what's wrong? -Cho-in, don't do this. -Kim Seo-yeon, be quiet. Lee Cho-in, whatever your feelings for Seo-yeon are, shouldn't you congratulate your brother first? Dr. Lee Sun-woo, you know that's not what this is about. No, I don't. Tell me why you're against it. There must be a reason. Why? Is there a reason you can't say? Tell us. Tell us why. Why? You can't? Then just accept it. You have no right to oppose our marriage. Give us your heartfelt blessing. That's all you can do. No. Don't kid me. Dr. Lee Sun-woo, I'll make you say it yourself. Kim Seo-yeon, listen up. You can't ever marry Sun-woo. Never. Let's go, Young-ji. Cho-in. Sun-woo, did you have to do that in front of Cho-in? And I told you I didn't want to rush into anything. Seo-yeon... you don't have to give me an answer right away. But I wanted to make our relationship clear to Cho-in. Lee Cho-in, I'm sure you don't want Seo-yeon to find out. You can't let Seo-yeon know that I tried to kill you. Leave Seo-yeon alone. I'm sorry, Young-ji. I'm okay. I shouldn't have been there. I'm sorry. No, I'm glad you were there. I'm sorry I ruined your dinner. Don't say you're sorry. I don't want you to feel sorry for me. Young-ji, I'll buy you a much better dinner another day. I'm craving some potato dumpling soup. Potato dumpling soup? I can always make... Dr. Lee... did you...? Let's hurry. I'm so hungry. NEUROSURGERY CENTER CASE CONFERENCE NEUROSURGERY CENTER CASE CONFERENCE Patient Lee Jong-min, 65 years-old. He was diagnosed with chordoma in 2007 at this hospital. And on December 14th of 2008, Dr. Lee Sun-woo operated on him. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Dr. Lee Sun-woo removed the tumors that were pressing on pons and medulla oblongata, but the patient fell into a vegetative state. Aren't you going to mention the fact that the patient, who was in a coma prior to surgery, began to breathe on his own afterwards? These are the pictures of Dr. Lee Jong-min's brain before and after surgery. As you can see, the size of the tumor before surgery was 5.2 cm, but on the biopsy report after the surgery the size was recorded as 5.8 cm. You can't argue that the size of the tumor grew by 0.6 cm in just two weeks, can you? Dr. Lee Cho-in, don't you think that's a foolish question coming from a neurosurgeon who even did a fellowship? Even the first year residents in our Neurosurgery Center know that the exact size of a tumor can't be determined with CT scan. The only way to get the exact size of a tumor is to open the head. And the only person who can get the exact measurement is the chief surgeon. The basic purpose of chordoma surgery is to remove tumors. Did that answer your question? So the tumor, which was 5.2 cm on the CT image, was actually 5.8 cm when you opened his head? That's right. Then if the 5.8 cm tumor you removed was just tumor, there shouldn't be any damage to the cerebellum. So why did the patient fall into a vegetative state? Dr. Lee Cho-in, have you checked his condition lately? Of course. Really? I guess you lost your knowledge on Neurology since you transferred to Emergency Medicine. Shall we take a look at the patient together? Lee Sun-woo. You shouldn't have gotten Dad involved if you have an ounce of conscience left in you. You're the one who started this fight. Before surgery, Dr. Lee Jong-min was in semi-coma, unable to breathe on his own. But right after surgery, he was able to breathe on his own, and gained consciousness as well as some sensory abilities. You brought the patient here just to prove that? Dr. Lee Cho-in, could you give me a minute? Father, can you hear me? If you can, please move your finger once. If you can't, move it twice please. Father... can you hear me? Father... am I Lee Cho-in? The surgery was a success. It was a huge success. Is he really awake? Is this good news or bad news? Dr. Lee Cho-in... you understand what the patient's display of obey command means, right? He's recovering his motor skills. Can you still say there is a problem with my surgery? May I confirm? Go ahead. Dad, I'm so sorry you had to come here. I didn't expect this either. Father, what should I do? Shall I accept Sun-woo's claims and back down? Dad, if you're awake, please tell me what to do. Something's wrong with him. Doctor Lee, I think that was just a muscle spasm. He moved his finger not because he recovered his motor skills, but because it was just a muscle spasm. Father, don't be nervous. Please move your hand. Unfortunately, the patient doesn't seem to have regained his motor skills. No, even if he recovered, that'd be a miracle, not the result of your surgery. Please look at this. It's the biopsy report on the tumor which Dr. Lee Sun-woo removed. As you can see, the report states the tumor was surrounded by 0.5 cm of normal tissue. Simply put, Dr. Lee Sun-woo removed not only the tumor but also some other normal brain cells. What's more interesting is that this specific report wasn't available on the EMR. Was it because you were trying to hide the fact that you intentionally removed his normal brain cells as well? If that's true, it's a crime! Dr. Lee Sun-woo has gone too far. Don't you know it's the chief surgeon's rightful decision on how much tumor to remove? Then you're saying that's the same reason why Ms. Choe Yu-rah lost her sense of taste? It's my policy, just the same as our Neurosurgery Center's, to put my patient's life first and foremost. Ms. Choe Yu-rah was the patient you attended to in flight on your return to Korea, right? So? This is her file. She was diagnosed with brain tumor at the Bosung in Cheong-ju six months prior to her flight. Additionally, she redid CT and MRI scans just a week before the surgery. And at the recommendation of a high-ranking hospital officer, she was put on the same flight as Dr. Lee Sun-woo. Does this show your policy and that of your center, to place a brain tumor patient on a plane and putting her life at risk with the sole purpose of promoting it? DR. LEE SUN-WOO PERFORMS SURGERY IN THE SKY Should you build a Neurosurgery Center that had such a despicable beginning? Ma'am, I think we've been deceived. We only prepared for questions on Director Lee's surgery, but he ambushed us with Choe Yu-rah's surgery. We were defeated by Lee Cho-in. I'm sorry. My thoughtlessness caused you this problem. Did you file a suit to nullify the title transfer? -Yes, I did. -Good. Calm the board members on our side first. We'll stop Cho-in from using his legal right on the title, and buy some time to come up with a plan. You have a plan? Either Cho-in or I'll have to disappear now. Your little meeting is over? Lee Cho-in... you're wrong if you think you've won. You're wrong if you think it's over. That arrogant jerk. That arrogant... Yes. Doctor. Time for my afternoon appointments already? I'm sorry, but they have been all cancelled. All right. Here are the emails from Prof. Jonathan Kim at Johns Hopkins and Dr. Yale Kwon at Mayo Clinic. They were supposed to join us here as exchange professors. What do they say? They want to reconsider our invitation. Why? They don't agree with your management style. What does that mean? Well... they seemed to know about today's case conference. You're wrong if you think it's over. All right. You may go. Dr. Kang, do you also think I'm wrong? I agree with your surgery style, but I don't agree with how the center got started. Cho-in really rock their boat. That felt great. -Yes, it did. -Yeah. But my heart dropped when the Director moved his finger. Yes, I was shocked, too. So is he getting his motor skills back or not? -Only the director knows. -Right. But how did Cho-in find out the vice-director set up Ms. Choe Yu-rah's case? I'm not sure. Cho-in did that on his own. So there could be someone else besides us who's helping him in this hospital? Well, I guess that's possible. Yeah, I guess. Miss Oh Young-ji, you've been just hired by a special submission and you're near to getting canned already. What do you mean, "canned"? You didn't hear the rumors? Dr. Lee Sun-woo, who gave you this job, and his younger brother Dr. Lee Cho-in had a huge fight. What? A huge fight? You didn't know? I thought you were connected, but you don't know anything. Young-ji, time for food. Dr. Lee... -Can I take her? -Of course. Go, Young-ji. It's lunchtime, but I'll stay here. Thanks. Oh, Young-ji, which of the brothers are you relying on? You know what, Dr. Lee? Is something going on at the hospital? Of course something's always going on here. Doctors can't make a living otherwise. That's not what I meant. I heard earlier that... you and Dr. Lee Sun-woo... Young-ji. Yes? Can you hear me? Not really. No matter what you hear in the hospital, keep your ears covered like this. Then I'll tell you everything later. Okay? Yes. Did you drink from the bottle? Yes. Why are you looking at me like that? Well, I wonder why. I couldn't remember your face so I wanted to take another look. They say people in love never get enough of looking at each other. Maybe I love you. Don't tease me. All right. I'm coming. Young-ji, I have to go. All right. They say people in love never get enough of looking at each other. Maybe I love you? I couldn't remember your face so I wanted to take another look. Dr. Lee ... did you just say those words or... did you get your memory back? Dr. Lee. Young-ji, you weren't sleeping? I have something to tell you. -By any chance-- -Young-ji, I'm really tired now. And I have a big day tomorrow. Will you let me sleep? Okay. Good night. Father... if what you did today was to take side with Cho-in... you made a mistake. To Cho-in, the son you love... that would be like... pushing him over the cliff. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We'll now begin the seventh-- Here's the title to the property for the new medical center that the director Lee Jong-min had transferred to me. It sounds like some people want to build a Neurosurgery Center on that piece of land. But the land's mine. So I'm going to do whatever I want with it. Dr. Lee Cho-in, don't you know the land may not only belong to you? Here's the copy of my suit file requesting the expunction and nullification of the title. I'm sorry, Vice-Director, but those documents are valid only when I'm dead in China. Your piece of paper has no power when I, the owner of the land, am alive. Isn't that right, Mr. Attorney? Yes, that's correct. Awesome! You all heard our attorney's confirmation so now I must excuse myself. Dr. Lee Cho-in, please tell us of your plan for the land before you leave. Of course I plan to build an Emergency Medical Center. I'm going to build the Emergency Medical Center, no matter what. The meeting's adjourned. Goodbye. Sun-woo! Are you all right? My son, are you all right? -Sun-woo! -I'm all-- Sun-woo! Sun-woo! Sun... Lee Cho-in, you jerk... I won't... I won't forgive you! Dad... I know. I know you're not happy. But we have to realize your dream. You said it's my destiny. That's why you helped me at the case conference, right? Dad... I'll build the Emergency Medical Center. I'll realize your dream. You trust me, don't you? So they will no longer build the Neurosurgery Center? Probably not, as long as Dr. Lee Cho-in owns the right to the property. Things are going to be really bad between Dr. Lee Cho-in and Dr. Lee Sun-woo. Yeah, it's too bad. They used to be so close. All this happened just because Dr. Lee Cho-in disappeared in China. Doctor, what do you mean? Two doctors are fighting because Dr. Lee Cho-in was missing? Originally, the director and Dr. Lee Cho-in had planned to build the Emergency Medical Center, but after the director collapsed with chordoma and Dr. Lee Cho-in went missing in China, Dr. Lee Sun-woo established the Neurosurgery Center. But now Dr. Lee Cho-in is back, and they started a war. Dr. Lee, I had no idea things would get out of hand like this because I helped your kidnappers in China. I'll confess everything to you and take my punishment. DR. LEE CHO-IN Young-ji, I'm going into surgery. I'll be done around midnight. See you at the cafeteria for a snack. Sun-woo... are you all right? Are you all right? Mother. Mom... Mom... Mother! You're up. Drink it. Plum juice. Why did you drink so much when you're not well? You don't remember anything, do you? What did I say? "I love you." And? And... "I love you" again. I made dinner. You think you can eat? Yes, let's eat. Go wash your hands. I'll set the table. I won't let you take anything away. Not the Neurosurgery Center... or Seo-yeon. Never, you jerk... Dr. Lee Cho-in. Dr. Lee Cho-in. -Dr. Lee. -Why are you so late? I'm starving. Come. Sit down. I cooked tonight. -You're hungry too, aren't you? -No. Really? Then I'll eat it all. Dr. Lee, I have something to tell you. What is it? When you were kidnapped in China... I told you about Mr. Choe, didn't I? But the truth is... I got paid by Mr. Choe... and watched you... Eat. Dr. Lee, maybe you're fighting with Dr. Lee Sun-woo... because of me. Young-ji, I'm not fighting with my brother because I was kidnapped in China. Huh? So stop worrying for nothing and eat. Young-ji, this potato dumpling soup is pretty addictive. Just like you. Dr. Lee... by any chance... did you get your memory back? Dr. Lee... do you remember what happened in China... my brother Kang-chul... and what we did in Cheong-ju? Yes... I remember everything. Then even when you knew everything... you pretended not to know to find out who kidnapped you? Dr. Lee... I'm sorry. I got greedy and did you wrong. I'm sorry. Young-ji... I said I'm not fighting with my brother because of you. Actually, I was wondering about something. When you came to Seoul to see me again, I was curious whether I liked you Oh Young-ji, the sister of Kang-chul, as being Oh Kang-ho or Oh Young-ji, the tour guide, as being Lee Cho-in. I wasn't sure back then. But it doesn't matter now. Because the Oh Young-ji I met was always the same person. Always kind and adorable. You know me well enough that I'm not a good person. Really? Then I won't like you. That's not fair. What I mean is... Eat. BOSUNG NEUROSURGERY CENTER IN ROUGH WATERS TWO BROTHERS IN CONFLICT I'll be helping this patient? He's really close to me, but he had brain surgery, and all he can move is just a finger. Watch carefully. Mr. Lee Jong-min, click on the mouse over the letter you want. -See? -Yes. He's rich and generous. You'll make big bucks. -I'm counting on you. -Sure. Bye. Hello, Mister. My name is Oh Young-ji. I'll help you from now on, so write whatever you want. Blink your eye once if I move the cursor to the letter you want. You want to give it a try? You're doing great. His surgery is today, right? Well, his family wants to cancel the surgery. -Are you his family? -Yes. Are you aware of his condition? If he doesn't get a surgery right away-- We'll go to another hospital even if it takes more time. I'd go to another hospital rather than taking the risk of making my father a vegetable. So sign the release form. How can you say that? Release him. I won't let you take anything away. Not the Neurosurgery Center... or Seo-yeon. Nothing, you jerk. Dr. Lee. Dr. Lee Cho-in. -Young-ji, what is it? -Come. Hurry. -What? -Let's go. What is it? What happened? Is he your father? How did you know? It's the first word he wrote. MY SON LEE CHO-IN Dad. Young-ji, I owe you big time. Yes, you do. What do you want to do? I want to see a night view of Seoul. The city night view? Then meet me at 6:00 in the lobby, okay? Dear Cho-in, Sun-woo is ill. That's the reason he couldn't come back seven years ago. The tumor he had then came back again. He may not have much time. Cho-in... we may not be able to see Sun-woo again. So don't hate him. You fix him. You're a neurosurgeon, too. You're a good surgeon. KIM SEO-YEON KIDNAPPING IN CHINA MR. OH AND WHO? LEE CHO-IN KIDNAPPING LAST CALL TO SUN-WOO PRISON CAMP MURDER ORDERED FLYER DEFECTOR LEE SUN-WOO SHOOTING IN DESERT No way, Kim Seo-yeon. You can't ever marry Sun-woo. Never. Lee Sun-woo, I'll make you tell her yourself. MURDER ORDERED LEE SUN-WOO Did you check on the patient? All right. I'll be right there. Seo-yeon. Kim Seo-yeon? Seo-yeon! Seo-yeon. Kim Seo-yeon. Sun-woo... it's not true, is it? It's not, is it? Kim Seo-yeon! Lee Cho-in. Lee Sun-woo. What did you tell her? What did you tell Seo-yeon? You're not worried about how she's feeling now, are you? You just want to know what she found out? Then go ask her yourself. You can't, can you? Then just accept it.
