 EPISODE 11 Sir! Sir! Why aren't you treating him? You can't just watch this man die. Call an ambulance. You should help him get on the path to restore his memory. If that path is closed, his posttraumatic stress disorder may worsen. I don't even know him. I have no memories of him.

 But he frightened me. So much that I could hardly breathe. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE Excuse me... But would you happen to know me? My name is Lee Cho-in. My name is Lee Cho-in. Would you happen to know me? Would you? You got the wrong number. I've lost my memory. But this number popped into my head. I said you got the wrong number. Please think about it.

 My name is Lee Cho-in... Hi. Let's have some lunch. Seo-yeon, give me a minute. Cho-in. By any chance... Aren't you Dr. Lee Cho-in? You are, aren't you? No. You have the wrong person. My name is Oh Kang-ho. No, it's not. He is Mr. Lee Cho-in. Ma'am, this man is Mr. Lee Cho-in. Yes, you are Dr. Lee Cho-in from Bosung Medical Center. The Dr. Lee who went missing in Shanghai six months ago. I was your tour guide in Shanghai, China. I'm Oh Young-ji. That's Oh Young-ji, Oh Kang-chul's sister. But also the Oh Young-ji who went on that Tolu mission with you. I have seen you participating in a brain surgery in China, too. You can't remember these things that happened in China. I was a part of those memories... Kang-ho... I mean, Dr. Lee Cho-in. I'm so sorry I could not tell you sooner. So forget that you were ever Oh Kang-ho. And forget me as well. Regain your memory and go on your way. I didn't understand a thing you said. You knew who I was from the first moment you met me? Yes... I knew. You knew I wasn't Oh Kang-ho but Lee Cho-in. Yet you played dumb? Yes... Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me that I was Lee Cho-in? Because I was lonely. After Kang-chul died, I had no one else. You were the only one I could lean on. You could have told me after that. You saw me tormented daily by nightmares. How could you? Because I liked you. I liked you, Mr. Lee Cho-in. I got selfish and I wanted you around. I figured you'd leave if you regained your memory. So I couldn't tell you. I know. It was wrong. And that it's too late. So... Go in search of your memory. I did a terrible thing. I'm so sorry. -Choe Bok-geun. -Yes, Dr. Lee. What is wrong with you people? Sorry? I told you to get rid of Lee Cho-in, so why is he still alive? We're not in China anymore. It's much easier said than done. I didn't call you to listen to your excuses. Lee Cho-in called me. Do you know what that means? He's starting to regain his memory. We've heard about this as well. Are you around Lee Cho-in? Where are you? Front of the ER in the Bosung Medical Center in Cheong-ju. What? At the Bosung affiliate in Cheong-ju? Seems like he's met one of his acquaintance. Who? This woman wears glasses and is getting up there in years. Kim Hyun-ju? Don't worry. I'll take care of him as soon as he steps out. No. You must first find out who he met and what he told them. Get rid of him after I go there and check for myself. Do you understand? Yes, we'll be waiting. Seo-yeon. Dr. Lee Sun-woo, you don't even have time for lunch. Something came up, I'm sorry. Let's go eat before the sushi gets hard. I have to head out, I'm sorry. Sun-woo, you can't even eat a few pieces of sushi? But once it's taken care of, I'll be with you every day. I promise. You and your talk. Anyway, make sure to eat regularly. Okay. I should go. The Director made you do three or more surgeries a day. No one knows why he drove you so hard. After he announced the foundation plan of an Emergency Medical Center, you joined me in the ER. Anyway, the last time I saw you, you left with a stash of meds and a smile to go save lives in China. Cho-in, are you listening? I'm sorry. Yes, you seem to have amnesia. So all of this must seem incredible. But now that you're here, take time to regain your memory. Don't worry. As you said, none of this is believable. No matter what anyone tells me, I can't believe a thing. You'll believe it when you see for yourself. Let's go to Seoul tomorrow and-- I was shot in the desert. What? Someone tried to kill me in China. As for who did it or who knows about it... I don't know a thing. I want to find out for myself. Cho-in. I can't believe anyone right now. I'm sorry. Cho-in. If some people really did try to murder you, the fact that you're alive must be shocking to them. They even had an urn with your name on it. You'll have to be careful until you regain your memory. BOSUNG MEDICAL CENTER DR. KIM HYUN-JU Thank you, Doctor. Anyway, the last time I saw you, you left with a stash of meds and a smile to go save lives in China. Yes, you are Dr. Lee Cho-in from Bosung Medical Center. You have the wrong number. Dr. Lee Sun-woo? Well, it is you, Director Lee. Long time no see, Dr. Kim. You must be busy at the Neuro Center, so what brings you to Cheong-ju? This is an affiliate hospital. I came to see how it's doing. But what are you doing in the ER? Are you looking for someone? Yes. I came to see you, Dr. Kim. Me? Why? I didn't mean to create sparks over the Neurosurgery Center. So you came to apologize? That needs no apology. You were a nominee to run the ER Center with Cho-in. So I came as a courtesy. Right. You're so energetic, but there aren't too many patients. You must be bored. Not having patients is a good thing. Can't say it's boring. I can see where the Neuro Center's headed. Do you? I'll let you get back. Sure. See you soon. EMERGENCY ROOM Where's Lee Cho-in now? He's at a park. Yes, we're tailing him. -Lee Sun-woo? -Yes. Why does he want to meet Lee Cho-in only to kill him? Cho-in has met up with some people. Sun-woo wants to see how much they might know. He covers his behind. I was your tour guide in Shanghai, China. I'm Oh Young-ji. Because I liked you. I liked you, Mr. Lee Cho-in. I got selfish and I wanted you around. I figured you'd leave if you regained your memory. So I couldn't tell you. I know that I was wrong. And that it's too late. So... Go in search of your memory. I did a terrible thing. I'm so sorry. Kang-chul... My selfishness has ruined everything. But... I did the right thing, didn't I? Mr. Choe, finish up the job. It must be wrapped up in Cheong-ju. I understand. Hello? Seo-yeon, this is Sun-woo. I'm hungry. Lee Sun-woo. What were you doing that you had to starve yourself? I was busy. So much that you couldn't even eat? I know. From now on, make it a priority. Okay. This seaweed soup is so good. You probably need about six more bowls. Yes, I'll take it all. But don't have too much. Eating too much isn't good for those getting treatment. FOOD GOOD FOR BRAIN CELLS You made a meal plan just for me? Thought I'd just feed you anything? Mister, you don't have a very high opinion of me. Kim Seo-yeon. It could be that wanting to eat your cooking... ...is what's kept me alive. I'll feed you till you can't eat anymore. Go have a seat. Just stay... Like this for a while... You must've had a long day. I just wanted to be happy with you like these kids. I never wanted to make you cry like this young girl. Just as kids age year by year, I wanted us to make memories together little by little. I'm just an idiot who can't even remember his name. I wanted to regain my memory and stick with you. Even if you and I were to grow fat like these people. You saw me tormented daily by nightmares. How could you? After the picnic... I was going to tell you everything. I was... ...going to let you go. You're asking if it's true? Yes, it's true that Cho-in is alive. He came back to life, Director Lee. Aren't you happy? So am I. I couldn't believe it at first. But it's really Cho-in. It's hard for me to tell you this. But there's more to why this has happened to Cho-in. Sure he has amnesia. But we had a funeral for a man who is still alive. There are questions about your chordoma surgery, too. Cho-in was supposed to be there. Sir? Dr. Kim Hyun-ju. How have you been, ma'am? What are you doing here at this hour? I have tomorrow off, so I dropped by to see everyone. Oh? Yes. I see the Director's condition hasn't changed. I'm grateful Sun-woo's surgery has him even in this state. I can't ask for more. Right. I'm grateful, too. I should get going. I wonder what Kim Hyun-ju is doing here, Director Lee. No need to try so hard. This is good. Any reason why you summoned me, sir? Did I make a mistake during the last surgery? No. Only if the other anesthesiologists could do as well as you. Your kind words are scaring me. Just joking. When I was at the affiliate in Cheong-ju yesterday, I ran into Dr. Kim Hyun-ju as well. I see. She still seems to be upset with me. Well, the Emergency Medical Center went down. I don't want to leave such a fine doctor at an affiliate. What do you mean? Once the Neurosurgery Center gets settled, the Emergency Medical Center might happen, too. Seriously? Of course. Oh... Dr. Kim Hyun-ju is doing fine otherwise? Well, she's an old maid who could use a guy. But that's off the record. Okay, I see. See you at the briefing. Sure. Off I go. Kang-chul. It's just the two of us from now on. So I'm going to keep striving. Thank you. Mr. Lee Cho-in. We're not doing any business today. What are you doing? Come with me. Are you coming or not? What? You promised that we'd go on a picnic. Young-ji. I'm still not very happy with you. I don't know if I'm coming back. So don't wait for me. Okay, I know. Mr. Lee, can we stop by home? Can I do the guest stay at the presidential mansion? I know that the date has passed, Supervisor. But this person means more to me than a king or a president... And it's my last chance to spend a memorable day with him. So could you give me a break? Young-ji, a guest stay is not possible. But there is a way. Really, sir? Thank you. Bye. Young-ji. You said you were my guide in China. What was I like? At first, I thought you were a hustler and a player. A hustler and a player? Yes, you had a bag full of drugs. You asked me for a massage. And you kicked me out of the room. You also changed the itinerary on a whim. I figured you for a selfish jerk. But I saw that you observed a brain surgery closely. And you treated those kids and took pictures in Tolu. So I realized what a kind person you are. And then you even... You even performed an appendectomy on me. An appendectomy... You knew I had defected, yet you were so attentive. You made sure I didn't have a scar. And you didn't want me to feel lonely... ...after the surgery. You left me a letter and took pictures with me. You got sick while following me around. Sorry I couldn't do the surgery under better conditions. After I met you... I no longer feared... ...going to Korea. And I decided to get on that ship, and smuggle myself into Korea. And call me when you get to Korea. Lee Cho-in. This wasn't just any old letter for me. It was like a compass inside my heart. Visiting hours are over. Everyone must vacate the presidential mansion. Hurry. Mr. Lee. Sit down. So much food. Mr. Lee, go wait outside. I'll be fine. I haven't been here in so long. How about some Dutch coffee? It takes so long though. It might be ready by tomorrow morning. No, it's almost done. TO SEO-YEON An original Beatles LP. I've wanted this. May 17th, 2002. Finally managed to get this in Baltimore on my 34th visit. February 6th, 2003. At a record store on 25th street in Manhattan. Found it on my third visit. September 25th, 2002. Talked a guy in Annapolis into it after 20 phone calls. ATTENTION: KIM SEO-YEON Just give me a minute. You silly man. You should've sent me those letters. Why did you even write them? You couldn't even be with me, yet you kept records of my heart ultrasounds. So we're together now. You've always been like this. To get me original Beatles LPs... You went to the store countless times. Just like the Dutch coffee... I drink it without knowing how much work went into it... But you prepared things and waited for me... Didn't you get tired? I didn't even appreciate it. Didn't you resent me? No. I enjoyed those times. Just thinking of you... One second. Hello? Miss Kim, this is Oh Young-ji. Oh, hello, Young-ji. I'm sorry, I've been busy. I've wanted to see you. Could you come down to Cheong-ju? To Cheong-ju? There's something I need to give you. It has to do with Mr. Lee Cho-in. Can you come? With Cho-in? Okay. It's not a problem, I'll go there. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Who was that? The girl who was Cho-in's tour guide in China. You mean Oh Young-ji? So you know her, too. She has something of Cho-in's in Cheong-ju. So? Will you go all the way to Cheong-ju? I have to pick it up if it belonged to Cho-in. You and I are the only ones who can carry on his memory. Would you come with me? Sure. We'll go. We should go get it. It belonged to Cho-in. Come sit here. What? Where were you going to sit? Over there... Come sit next to me. Young-ji. This potato dumpling soup is strangely addictive. Kind of like you. Sometimes you're all about money. Sometimes you're all about sass. And sometimes you're like a little sister. And sometimes you're like a mom. So I miss you when I don't see you. I can't get enough of you. Mr. Lee, you already know I'm not worthy of that. You're right. Sometimes you're like a little five year old brat. Is there someone in the banquet room? At this hour? Mr. Lee, we have to go. The person who let me in here might get fired. I'm sorry. It seems as if the two of us are always on the run. Young-ji. I'm going to the hospital tomorrow. I'm going home, so I should be happy. But I'm scared. Countless people who I don't remember will recognize me. Even those who tried to kill me might be there. And I'll be smiling at them like an idiot. Don't worry, Mr. Lee. Some people will be on your side. Even if I do regain my memory... The time I spent with you in Cheong-ju... ...may end up being the happiest time of my life. I'll come back. I'll come back, Young-ji. Mr. Lee, you may not know this. Once your memory comes back, you'll forget little old me. You might even forget this very moment. But I'll be just fine. Even if you don't come back, the memory of tonight is enough to keep me waiting. I'll keep my promise to you. I'll come back, Young-ji. Did you sleep well, Mr. Lee Cho-in? Now you're really leaving in search of your memories. I'll keep being a tough little cookie. So you regain your memory. And I saw you crying listening to this CD. The song was written by the woman you love. Her name is Miss Kim Seo-yeon. And she cried more than anyone when she heard you died. Go here by eleven o'clock and you'll meet her. I long ago forgot the promise you made about living as Oh Kang-ho. So you forget it, and recover your memories. I hope that they will bring you happiness. Mr. Lee Cho-in, stay healthy. Boss, should we follow her? We'll take care of Lee Cho-in first and then get to the small fry. Right? Man-ho, it's time for you to resolve things. What do you mean? We can't use a gun in Korea. -See that it gets resolved. -Sorry? Whoever I turn out to be... I'll keep my promise to you, Young-ji. I'll be back, Young-ji. It's already eleven, we're late. Sorry, I thought I knew the way. We're in Cheong-ju, so we'll find it. That might be it. One second. Hello? -What happened? -I'm sorry. Lee Cho-in left from the presidential mansion late, and then got on the bus, so we missed him. Save your excuses. Just take care of it. Mr. Lee, I can breathe now. You'll meet Miss Kim and regain your memory. I can breathe. The light's green. Oh? Sun-woo! Help! Sun-woo... Help me. Are you okay? Her name is Miss Kim Seo-yeon. And she cried more than anyone when she heard you died. Kim Seo-yeon... Step on it.
