 FINAL EPSIODE What? Are you afraid that you might die? So you threw away your pride and showed up? You decide whether I live or die. Why should I? You’re going to die anyway. I won't. And I'll watch you slowly wasting away, painfully regretting what you did. Dr. Lee...

 Father, did Dr. Lee Cho-in come here by any chance? DEAR LEE CHO-IN How's the patient? The CT scan shows the cerebral edema is getting worse. Have you called neurosurgery? Yes, the chief is on his way. Let's have the chief open up the skull to decrease the pressure. And then close it up? We have to stop the hemorrhaging and remove the tumor! Call Dr. Kang again. Yes, Doctor. Where's Cho-in?

 Sun-woo refused to have the surgery unless Cho-in did it. Let's move him to the operating room first. No word from Dr. Nam? Cho-in is going to do my surgery. What do you mean? Cho-in is doing your surgery? It's just as I told you. I won't have the surgery unless Cho-in does it. Sun-woo, we have no idea what Cho-in might do to you. How can you trust him to do the surgery? Sun-woo. He’s no longer Cho-in we used to know. We don't know what he might do to you. If Cho-in wants to kill me... Then I should die. Please stop being so stubborn and listen to me. Unless you have the surgery now, the tumor might kill you at any time. Even if you have to be punished, you must live first. I orchestrated everything, so why should you die? I should be the one to die. Mom, please respect my wishes this once. I'm sorry. No... Dr. Lee, where are you? Young-ji, I don't feel like seeing anyone right now. It's not because I want to see you. Your father wants me to give you something. On the roof? Okay. Have you seen Dr. Lee Cho-in? No, I haven't. Jong-min, Sun-woo has collapsed. But he won't have the surgery unless Cho-in does it. Please save Sun-woo. You have to convince Cho-in. Save Sun-woo... Please save him... Seo-yeon, we'll take over from here. Okay, take care of him. Dr. Lee Cho-in. What do you think you're doing? Cho-in, everything... All of this was my fault. My greed drove the two of you to this point... Cho-in. If you do Sun-woo's surgery, if you save Sun-woo... I'll do anything you ask. I'll tell the world whole world about my sins. I'll even go to jail if you want. I'll gladly grow old and die in there or be executed. Just please save Sun-woo! Please save Sun-woo... Don't you know that he will die even with the surgery? Yes, he'll probably still die... He'll get sicker and die... But I can see him at least another day. I can at least send my dying son off with a farewell. If he leaves us now, I won't even be able to say goodbye. Cho-in... Please save Sun-woo! Save your brother, please... Brother? I have no brother. Go and tell him to die. Will you stop wasting time? The swelling's getting worse. We have to do something now or else. Is Cho-in coming? He's still not here, so I guess not. Dr. Nam, let's open up the patient's head. Let's do a decompression to save his life. Yes, ma'am. Young-ji. Is that how you think of me, too? As a jerk who won't do his only brother's surgery? No, I know how you feel. That not doing the surgery... ...puts you in more pain than doing it. But still... You did surgery for a North Korean defector with no conditions. You even wrote her a letter. Forget that he's your brother or enemy. First and foremost, you're a doctor. And he's a patient who wants you to operate on him. Young-ji, I'm standing my ground this time. Yes... Follow your heart. Your father asked me to give you this. Dr. Kang. I'm sorry I'm late. Please take care of Sun-woo. Okay. Man, I'm losing it... Dr. Lee? Young-ji, I'm going in the operating room. Father, Dr. Lee Cho-in is going to his brother's surgery. There's nothing to worry about now. Dr. Kang... But you were just in there. Don't tell me... You needn't worry. Dr. Lee Cho-in is doing the surgery. What? Dr. Kim. Don't worry, Cho-in will do a good job. Tumor bleeding in the left frontal lobe. What's most urgent is the swelling. So we'll do a craniotomy and do a decompression. We'll remove the tumor and stop the hemorrhaging. Patient's vitals? Unstable, we need to hurry. Scalpel. Raney scalp clip. Drilling the burr hole. Neurotome! Pressure on the dura mater. Fifteen scalpel. Metzenbaum scissors. We've done the decompression, let's remove the tumor. Set up the microscope and the table. Okay, the swelling's down. Removing the tumor. Navigation probe. Starting cortisectomy. Bipolar. What about the posterior margin? There are some residual tissues. Lee Cho-in. You decide whether I live or die. Lee Sun-woo. You think you get what you wish for? I'll watch you slowly wasting away, painfully regretting what you did. Cho-in, do you remember when I once said that the Emergency Medical Center may be your destiny? Of course. It's been your lifelong dream. Yes, it has. And to realize that dream, you and I might have to shed countless tears. You were born with that destiny. 30 years ago, my closest friends who were your biological parents came to the ER after being in a car crash. This sounds like an excuse, but it was the weekend. The ER intern and I were in charge of your parents' lives. Your father died while the intern was performing CPR on him. And I did the surgery on your mother... But due to a cerebral hemorrhage and placental abruption, she died with a 33-week-old baby in her womb. I had prided myself on being the best neurosurgeon in Korea. But your parents' deaths left me feeling powerless. Whenever I thought about your parents, who put their faith in me as they were in pain, my heart would rip into pieces. As a man who couldn't even save his friends' lives, I had to build an Emergency Medical Center. And there was no one else but you who'd lead it. It was my only way to receive the forgiveness of my loving friends. OPERATION TIME 04:00 Do you understand now why the center was your destiny? And in the process, I unwittingly scarred your brother Sun-woo. Could you give him the affection I couldn't as his father? You two were such loving brothers. IN OPERATION Could you fulfill my wish? I'm sorry, Dad. I may defy you for the first time ever. The decompression and the removal are finished. Dr. Nam, please finish up. Yes, Dr. Lee. Good work, everyone. Good job, all. Dr. Lee, good work. Dr. Nam, what was that about earlier? Well, it was mixed in with the normal tissues. But some of the tumor was left in the posterior margin. His methods are totally different from Dr. Lee Sun-woo's. So some of the tumor tissues were left? Okay, let's keep a close watch. And Dr. Nam... Okay. Dr. Nam, how did it go? Pardon? I think it went well... Really? When will he wake up? It's different for each patient. Let's do a CT scan before he wakes up. Right... Something happened, didn't it? Like what? The CT scan will show the results. Is Cho-in not out yet? What is it? Have you heard that Sun-woo has woken up? What? Really? Really. Thank goodness. Yes... I was worried there was a problem during the surgery... Well, there was a problem. Really? Hey, Cho-in. I better get going, see you later. Dr. Lee, can you hear me? It's me, Kang Seok-hoon. Dr. Lee, move your hand if you can hear me. Dr. Lee... Sun-woo, can you see your mother? Sun-woo, it's me, your mom. Do you recognize me? Dr. Kang, what's going on? What’s wrong with him? Well, I really don't know. What do you mean you don't know? According to the CT scan and the test results, the surgery was a success. But I don't understand why he can't talk and has no motor skills. You don't understand? You're telling me that he'll live the rest of his life like this? I'm afraid I can't say anything about that either. Maybe there was a problem with Dr. Lee Cho-in's surgery method? What? He seemed to be in a strange mood, and I mentioned that more of the tumor should be removed. He said nothing and wrapped up the surgery. Dr. Nam, the chief surgeon makes all the decisions. I'm sorry. There were no problems with Dr. Lee Cho-in's methods in my opinion. He may respond to other tests, so we'll do a functional MRI. Sure... Do everything you can. Put him in a wheelchair. Ma'am... My poor Sun-woo... Even though the surgery was a success, he only has two years. But even in those two years... He won't be able to see or say what he wants. He'll be deaf and mute for those two years. My poor son... We don't know that yet, they're running more tests. No, if another doctor did it, there would be a chance. But it was Cho-in... This is the end... I'll go check up on Sun-woo. Miss Kim. Young-ji. I heard that Dr. Lee Sun-woo is awake, so I brought something. The director wrote this letter for him. Could you give this to him? Sure. As you can see, Dr. Lee Sun-woo is awake now. But we can't tell his condition yet. We're going to run a functional MRI. Any words of advice as the chief surgeon? Lee Sun-woo chose to have the surgery, so he should know the best. Jong-min. Sun-woo had his surgery and has woken up. He can move his hands and feet, but he's in the same condition you were in. Cho-in did the surgery. Yes... Cho-in is a human being after all. He hates me and wants to take something from me. Just as I... hurt Cho-in by taking his parents away... He must want to take Sun-woo from me. I know, too... That Cho-in is not your child. I was blind... I only realized it after doing that to his parents. No, I did it because I already knew. Every time I see him, he reminds me of my sins. I was afraid he'd learn of what I did... So I pushed him away, tried to escape... And I hated him even more. I should've died before Cho-in found out. I would've paid for my sins, and this wouldn't have happened to Sun-woo. Hae-ju, don't be so hard on yourself. It was me who made you that way. I didn't try to clear up the misunderstanding. But I made it worse and put you through hell. It's all my fault. Whatever you may have done, you are my wife. And the love of my life. Dear, let's ask for forgiveness together. Jong-min... Your father wrote this letter for you. Can I read it for you instead? You may not hear me, but your heart would feel me. I will read it for you now. To my son Sun-woo... Why couldn't I understand back then that you were only five when we adopted Cho-in? Cho-in looked so frail in that incubator. Then you'd run around holding him in your arms. You looked so proud, but your eyes cried out, "Dad, looked at me, I'm your son, too." Only had I known that... You should've held my hand sooner... ...I would've told you, "I love you, my son." I'm sorry. Cho-in was like a cross I was destined to carry. Help him with the Emergency Medical Center in my place. Love him like you used to. Do you know why I made you change to neurosurgery? I believed that you'd fulfill my unrealized dreams. You are my other self, my dream and my future. Sun-woo, become the best neurosurgeon in the world. I've never had the chance to tell you this... But I love you... my dear son Lee Sun-woo... I LOVE YOU... MY DEAR SON LEE SUN-WOO... Going somewhere? Yes, I'm going to Cheong-ju for a while. Why? To sell the restaurant and tie up some loose ends. When will you be back? I don't plan on coming back. What? I'm not coming back on my own, so you'll have to come get me. Since your brother's surgey you don't seem very happy. You two should sort things out. When you feel better, come get me. Well, I better get going. Young-ji, I promise to come get you. ONE MONTH LATER NOTICE Notification on the results of the 6th regular board meeting. Vice-Director Nah Hae-ju has resigned from her position... She has asked Trustee Yun to take over in the interim until the appointment of a permanent assistant director. When was this decided? I was too busy to attend the board meeting, but the assistant director must've made her wishes clear. Thus ends the Nah Hae-ju era. I reckon so. So peace has come after a bloodbath. Sun-woo has been moved to a sanitarium. It feels so empty and lonely here. The hospital's doing just fine. It's your life that's empty and lonely. Hey, I’m feeling down already. Stop provoking me. That's it! You need someone to provoke you in your old age Maybe I could be the one to provoke you for the rest of your life? Wait, did you just propose to me? I wouldn't just do it with empty words now... What was that? Think about it. This cost me three months' salary. Once you touch it, I can't get a refund. So think very carefully. If you're good with it, give me an okay kiss. Does it have lifetime warranty? What are you doing? Hello, Cho-in. I was about to go see you. Is this your idea of paying for your sins? No. I can never pay for killing your parents. I'm sorry, Cho-in. I was just a woman after all... I was afraid of losing the man I love to another woman. The paranoia and the jealousy blinded me. I was a foolish woman... Cho-in... It may take two months or two years... But I'll be sure to pay for my sins one day... I'm sorry. I really am... Cho-in, when that time comes, will you call me your mother? Can I call you my son? I, too... I, too, want to call you my mother. But not now. When will I be able to call you my mother again? Young-ji, do I look like a rider? A rider? Isn't that for hiking? Yes, but I can wear it when riding motorcycles. Am I the man or what? The wind won't seep through when I ride motorcycles? That's right. It's so light, I'll take this. You like it? Why is it so expensive? Come on, after all I did for you? Just buy it for me. Fine, I'll get it for you. Come here. Pick something out. What? I'll get this for you. I have it already. Stop wasting your money, and start saving. Come on. Hey, wait for me! Dr. Lee. It's already been a month and you're still dealing with things? Or have you forgotten all about me? Hello? For delivery? I'll be right there. Delivery at this hour? Yes, 40 orders of dumplings. Get off. But why do I have to get off? You'll make me late. Jin-ho! You're really leaving me behind? Young-ji, have a good time. Jin-ho! Hey, the buses don't even run around here! Jin-ho! Dr. Lee... Dr. Lee Cho-in. Is that you, Dr. Lee Cho-in? Is that you? Young-ji, I'm not too late, am I? You're not late at all. Should we live in Cheong-ju in the future? In Cheong-ju? Yes, I was very happy during our time in Cheong-ju. Whether it's in Seoul or Cheong-ju, I'll be happy as long as I'm with you. THE LATE MR. OH KANG-CHUL Kang-chul, this is my girlfriend. I want to marry Young-ji. So I came to get your blessing. Do we make a good couple? Kang-chul... This is the person I wanted you to meet. Would it be all right if I marry him? Kang-chul, this isn't about keeping my promise to you. I just happened to fall in love with Young-ji. You asked me to drive, but where are we going? You'll see. Have you been well, Miss Kim? Yes, I've been great. Catching up on all the dates I missed with that man. The only thing I could wish for is to have more time like this. Lee Sun-woo, aren't you tired of being in that prison? If you built that prison because of the sins you committed against me... It's time that you get out. Lee Sun-woo. Do you know the real reason why you can't be forgiven? Those beautiful times we had. Those moments... You made it impossible to go back. I'm dying to go back to those days, but now we'll never be able to. The brother whom I loved the most in this world... I can't meet him again. My brother Sun-woo. Even if we can't go back to those days... It's time that you come back. You're in such a cold lonely place. We live with memories every day. Some memories can come back to you if you keep trying. But there are memories that can never be erased no matter how hard you try. Living as a human being means trying not to make those memories. It's a process of trying to steer clear of such memories. And if the painful memories are caused by a loved one, they cannot be erased for a very long time. But even the scars from unforgettable memories can only be healed by other human beings. Every one of us has beautiful and happy memories. A human being's only redemption is another human being.
