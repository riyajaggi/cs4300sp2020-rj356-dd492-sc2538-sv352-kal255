 Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, my brother. Happy birthday, Sun-woo. I haven't seen you in three years. Wherever you are, have a good birthday. Miss you... Help me blow these out. One, two, three. I'm sorry, Lee Cho-in. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... NEUROSURGERY CENTER DIRECTOR: LEE SUN-WOO All set, Director. Director Lee Jong-min and I, as next of kin,

 have equitably divided the assets belonging to the deceased Lee Cho-in. As the Director is in a comatose state, I will act as his legal guardian, and fully support the establishment of a new Neurosurgery Center. And Dr. Lee Sun-woo, from Neurosurgery, is appointed the Operating Director of the Neurosurgery Center. Everything will take effect as of this announcement. The Vice-Director of Bosung Medical Center, Nah Hae-ju. Why, that old wench... We plan to complete the Neurosurgery Center by 2010. Thus we are going ahead with the reorganization of the hospital. The center will be made up of two departments, research institution and clinical division. Trustee Oh In-geun will head the Research Department. The Clinical Department will incorporate neurology, psychiatry, radiology, and anesthesiology, and cultivate new ground in neurosurgery. Doctors must be on call to perform surgery within 20 minutes. Reduce your commute time so you can do more surgery and research. We'll do a case conference of every single surgery and emerge as a world-class surgical institution. May I ask a question, Dr. Lee Sun-woo? Please. We've been doing a case conference of each surgery. So what's so different about these new conferences? Are you saying you'll reveal the info to the patients? Of course. All the info from every surgery will be available to the patients. It's time for you to discard your sense of easygoing entitlement as a university hospital doctor. You'll all be held responsible for the outcomes of your surgeries. And that applies to me as well. Please remember this. We're waging a war against the uncharted territory of the human brain. What are you trying to do?! You promised me the head position at the Center! That was contingent upon you keeping your promise. Why did you agree to Hyun-ju's request for a board meeting? Because it wouldn't affect the decision regarding the Center. You got what you wanted, so you couldn't care less. Do you know how I got here from being just a country boy? I'm no pushover. You just watch, I'm not going to back down. Dr. Jo Hyun-taig. The ethics committee approved your anticonvulsant experiment. But you received something from the drug company. This is a copy of the bank transaction. You have a son named Jo Young-seok in the States? Hey, Oh Kang-ho. How did Oh Kang-chul die? He killed himself. Stop dozing off and talk to me! You killed Oh Kang-chul, didn't you? Oh Kang-ho! No... Kang-chul killed himself. Stop spouting nonsense, jerk. Why would he kill himself after calling us for help? You killed him, didn't you? No... A witness saw you kill Oh Kang-chul. Still going to deny it? Bring him in. Is he the one who killed Oh Kang-chul? Yes, he is. I've no plans to go to South Korea. Choi... Choi Chi-soo... I'm positive. He killed Comrade Oh. He conspired with North Korean security troops. He stabbed and shot Comrade Oh. I'll kill you! Let me go! I'll kill you! Let me go! What is your professional opinion, sir? Even after 72 hours without sleep, he's still repeating the same thing. I don't think he's lying. Violence towards Choi Chi-soo is a normal reaction of anger. Not many can repeat the same thing after 72 hours without sleep. It's only possible for highly trained special agents. He could simply be a determined person. How can someone so determined lose his memory? A determined person would've regained his memory already. It can be psychological, but it can also be physiological. Take a look. In my humble opinion, the cause was physiological, from the impact of the bullet that grazed his head. I see. Thank you. What do you think? There's no evidence to support Choi's story either. So you think Choi is lying? One of them is lying. This photo was found on Oh Kang-ho. Maybe we can bring in Oh Young-ji and-- And what if Oh Kang-ho does turn out to be a secret agent? Oh Young-ji could get killed. In 1997, Kim Jong-il's niece was killed after defecting to the South. North Korea could kill Oh Young-ji as an example of what happens to those who try to defect from them. Scour all North Korean records regarding Oh Kang-ho. If anything points to him being a secret agent, deport him to China. Yes, sir. EMPLOYMENT AGENCY DRIVER'S LICENSE OH YOUNG-JI Miss Oh Young-ji. So you can speak Chinese and Japanese. And you've been a guide for two years? That's right, sir. But because of the bad economy, no one is actively hiring. And it's even harder for immigrants. Do you have anything? Are you okay with lower pay and working out of town? Anywhere will do. Just find me a job, sir. What in the world do they eat? They sure are tall. Special sale! Come and try. Just two bucks! Ma'am, come and have some. Special sale. She's so obviously an immigrant. Special sale! Just five dollars for 100g of premium beef. Thank you. MISSING CHILD KIM DAE-HYUN They found Cho-in in the desert. What was he doing in the desert? The hospital that did the surgery? Where are you going? I'm not paying you if you leave! Stuff yourself with that beef. Excuse me. Do you know Dr. Lee Cho-in by any chance? I saw you at the funeral. You must be his family, right? So your name is Oh Young-ji? And you were Cho-in's tour guide in China? Yes, that's correct... And... What do you want? Well... I have to tell you something about him. He might have been kidnapped. Kidnapped? And on what basis? When I was in China, these people paid me to watch him. They even pulled out guns and tried to kidnap him. But I managed to sneak him out and get him his ticket for his flight. But Dr. Lee never made it back to Korea... So I'm wondering if those guys did something bad to him. When I met with Miss Kim Seo-yeon... I wanted to bring it up... But I was just so afraid... But not to know how he passed away... It must haunt you, and it's so unfair on him. So... The people who tried to kidnap Cho-in... Do you remember their names? Yes, I remember the man's name and phone number. Mr. Choe in China, he runs an import-export business. Do you want his phone number? He conspired with North Korean Security troops. He stabbed and shot Comrade Oh. Choi Chi-soo... I'll kill you! Kang-ho... Live and go on, and look after Young-ji for me. You grabbed my ankles while I was unconscious in the desert. You wanted to live. You were left for dead after being shot. Shoot! Kill me! You must live to uncover the truth. Live, Kang-ho. You think I can find everything? In South Korea... The ones I loved... and the reasons why I was discarded? Thank you, come again! Hello, how many? Four? This way. Here. Jin-ho? How have you been? So you're out. Were you placed in Seoul? No, they put me in Cheong-ju. Cheong-ju? I didn't get so lucky. I just came by to see you. Have you eaten? You can eat at the restaurant I work at. It's okay. Let's finish this up before it gets colder. My, look at the time. Going somewhere? I work two jobs, I mean three jobs. You better go. I'll finish the rest. Once Kang-chul gets here, I'll get you back. Sure. Thanks, I better go. Okay. Go. It's like she's been in Seoul forever. But what's this about two jobs...? CHOE BOK-GEUN Thank you, Miss Oh. I'll get to the bottom of this. Not at all, I should thank you. But could you keep this between us? I don't want any misunderstandings. You needn't worry. I just want you to do Dr. Lee Cho-in justice. Mr. Lee Cho-in... Do you feel better now? Please stop hating me... And rest in peace. Put more emotion into it. Don't you understand the lyrics? The love of your life just left you. Let's go again. Seo-yeon. It's been 15 straight hours since last night. She can hardly sing right now. Why don't we take a break? Miss Kim Seo-yeon, that's enough. It's time for you to go to the hospital, too. Sure, let's start again at five. Okay. Give your voice a rest. Thank you. Thank you, come on out. Thanks. Kim Seo-yeon, you're one tough cookie these days. Teaching kids all day long, and producing records all night long. Since when were you such a workaholic? You don't say. What's gotten into me? Is it so tough that you have to do all this? No, I just have to catch up after being in China. That's good to hear. Going out of your way to avoid him is even sillier. Thanks. I'm off. Look after her. She's having a hard time trying to forget Cho-in. Smile at her, would you? You're such a stiff. I'll try. Bye. GAMMA KNIFE TREATMENT 1:00PM @ HANGUK HOSPITAL Hello? Dr. Lee, you have a visitor from the Foreign Ministry. Foreign Ministry? I was in Korea for a vacation, and I remembered what you said. You wanted to know what would happen to those defectors. Were they deported to China? No, they both escaped. The one who threatened you with a pen, and the wounded man. They both escaped while being transported to North Korea. All because you treated that man. They may even be here in South Korea. I thought you'd appreciate the news. Why are you so cruel to Sun-woo? It's not as if he made Cho-in disappear. Jung-min. I know, I really do. But don't you realize that it's hard for him, too? So he tells me to forget Cho-in the day his ashes get here? Just as I forgot him after he disappeared? And what I went through after he disappeared... He has no idea how difficult it was for me! How can I smile at someone so inconsiderate? I told you that Sun-woo was ill. Why does that matter now? That's why he never came back? Actually, Sun-woo did come back. What? He was here for your heart surgery. When you were comatose after the heart transplant, he held your hand and prayed. He said it was okay if he had to go, but asked for you to be saved. Cho-in. Is Sun-woo still not here? Why didn't you tell me? That Sun-woo came... He was worried you'd find out about his illness. He begged me not to tell you. Hello? I want the most recent list... The list of all North Korean defectors within the last month. Whatever it may cost, I want it as soon as possible. No way... It's impossible... No way... I don't remember. You didn't make it look like a suicide? No. How did you get your head and chest wounds? I don't remember. I'm Oh Kang-ho. What are the results? He must be Oh Kang-chul's cousin for certain. Polygraph results indicates that he gave a lot of conflicting answers. But he was sure about being Oh Kang-chul's cousin Oh Kang-ho. From the database of North Korean population. There are some 100 men of the same name and similar age. But the most fitting description is that of Oh Kang-chul's cousin. There's no photo. He's been trained as a special agent since the age of 14. So no photos of him exist. And that's why he doesn't speak with a North Korean accent? Yes. Let me cut to the chase. Our research indicates you are not Oh Kang-ho. Your claim of having amnesia isn't credible. And the North Korean records don't match. We'll have no choice but to deport you to China. Why do you believe Choi Chi-soo but not me? Is it because I'm an amnesiac? You burned off your thumbprint to hide your identity. Who are we supposed to believe? You or Choi Chi-soo? No matter what you say... The man who killed Kang-chul is that jerk Choi Chi-soo. You said Oh Kang-chul killed himself! My brother Kang-chul... ...was just trying to save me. Because Choi Chi-soo had shot him... He was trying to save my life! Now let me ask a question. Have you checked the scar on Choi Chi-soo's thigh? That's where Kang-chul stabbed the jerk. Scars like that are a dime a dozen among Special Forces. That's hardly evidence. Then what about the bag with the US dollars? What if I told you... ...that he killed Kang-chul for that money? Choi Chi-soo sold the drugs for North Korea. So that's not evidence either. Anything else? If not, you'll have to go back to China. Oh Young-ji... Let me meet with Oh Young-ji. Let me meet with Oh Young-ji. That's my last request. Rice cakes! Buy some rice cakes. These are so good. They're home-made in North Korean style. I got some mooncakes, too. Ma'am, take one. Come on, just buy one. I'll take a mooncake. Mooncake? Just a second. Here you go, three bucks. Wait, you're the government agent...? Really? Kang-ho is here in Seoul? Yes. Is he your older cousin? Yes, of course he is. I didn't get to see him often, but our families were close. Then what about my brother? Has Kang-chul come too? He couldn't make it yet? Mr. Oh Kang-chul is here, too. Thank you so much! Kang-chul... So if they're really Kang-chul and Kang-ho, we can all leave together? Once their identities are confirmed, they'll be sent to the orientation center. Why do I need to confirm my own family? I'll recognize them right away. Don't you worry. In here? No... It can't be... That can't be my brother. Sir... That's not what I want... I want to see my brother. You told me I'd be seeing Kang-chul and Kang-ho. Let me see my brother Kang-chul. As I tried to tell you before... Mr. Oh Kang-chul died in a skirmish while in China. No... Kang-chul is so fast... and so strong... He'd outlast everyone in this world. That's not my brother. My brother is definitely alive. He promised he'd come see me. That he'd bring our parents and come see me. So please look into it, I beg you. Our government agents confirmed his body. Kang-chul... You broke your promise... You said... That we'd survive and meet... You said that if I managed to live... You'd come find me... You could have come in one piece... You were a mountain of a man, too... And you're in this tiny little thing... In this tiny thing... Come back... Kang-chul... Cho-in. So that wasn't you holding my hand back then? That was Sun-woo? LEE SUN-WOO Miss Oh Young-ji? Miss Oh Young-ji? The person you'll be meeting insists that he is Oh Kang-ho. We've concluded that he has amnesia. We need you to confirm whether he's really Oh Kang-ho or not. Do you understand? Send him in. Miss Oh, your phone. Hello? Young-ji, this is Kim Seo-yeon. Miss Kim... You don't sound well, are you sick? Miss Kim, I'll call you back. I'm sorry... Miss Oh, do you recognize this person? Is this your cousin? He... Miss Oh Young-ji, my name is Oh Kang-ho. We told you, no talking. Miss Oh Young-ji, do you recognize me? The only thing I remember is the name Kang-chul called me by. So... Tell me who I am. Please tell me who I am. This person... This person is... You've confirmed that man as Oh Kang-ho. If that turns out to be a lie, you'll be charged as well and have your stipend and housing taken away. Do you understand? Yes. If he assumed the identity of Oh Kang-ho, we'll deport him back to China. Deport him? Miss Oh, is that man really Oh Kang-ho? Yes, he is. Are you sure? Yes... I'm sure. That man is... ...my cousin, Oh Kang-ho. Kang-chul. Did I do the right thing? You sent that man, so I did the right thing, didn't I? Sir. I'm leaving for Cheong-ju. If you don't want me to go, hold my hand and yell at me. "Kim Hyun-ju!" "I told you to run the Emergency Medical Center!" Do you believe in fate? Cho-in died early just like his real parents... Was that just fate? Goodbye, Sir. There's not much I can do. I'll go see her off, Sir. I'm the one who got demoted, but you're the one with the long face. Let's just work for a different hospital. How can someone of your abilities work at an affiliate hospital? No, I'm going. Why? I promised the Director. I'm not giving up, no matter what. That's what he would've wanted. So look after him. Do me that favor. Whatever. You were always the top anesthesiologist. Sun-woo's getting on my nerves, but he realizes that at least. Right? Come here. What, are you going to hit me? I'm going to give you a hug as a farewell present. EMERGENCY ROOM So we're all going to be set. You idiots, South Korea is no paradise. You're nothing without money. Out of my way! What the heck? Oh Kang-ho... Done with the questioning? Good to see you. Comrade Choi Chi-soo. Choi Chi-soo. Even if I lose my memory again, I won't forget your name. And remember this. You'll die by my hand. What's going on? Mr. Choi, you'll be held for further questioning. What do you mean? You got those US dollars by selling drugs, right? Isn't that why you tried to kill Oh Kang-chul? Which son of a gun uttered such nonsense? Choi Chi-soo! We know that Oh Kang-chul stabbed you in the thigh. Oh Kang-ho, why that son of a gun... Oh Kang-ho, you jerk... I'll kill you! NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE Mr. Oh Kang-ho. How... How did you become my cousin Kang-ho? When I was dying in the desert... Kang-chul wanted us to be brothers until I regained my memory. He gave me the name Oh Kang-ho... in memory of his cousin. Miss Oh. Thank you for letting me live as Oh Kang-ho. Until I regain my memory... Or even after I regain it... I'll always be Oh Kang-ho to you. Thank you. Congratulations. Haven't you had enough, sir? Wouldn't you be drinking, too? Get me my drink! Nah Hae-ju, how will I get you back? Hey, why the long face? No, how could I be unhappy on such a happy occasion? Let me introduce you. Dr. Jung Young-gyu, the Chief Neurosurgeon at Hanguk Hospital. And this man needs no introduction. Dr. Jo Hyun-taig, the Head of Neurosurgery at Bosung. It's an honor, sir. Please, you have a few years on me. Excuse me. Dr. Lee Sun-woo seems busy these days. Lee Sun-woo? What about him? He has Gamma Knife treatment scheduled for today. But I can't reach him. Gamma Knife? Oh my, doctor-patient confidentiality... Excuse me. But aren't we colleagues? Why don't we go out for a drink together? HAENG-BOK MEMORIAL PARK This way. CHOE BOK-GEUN 86 1337 026125 We received Cho-in's remains from China yesterday. Where was Cho-in discovered? In the desert. So we can compare that to the matching ring. Trustee Oh In-geun... I have my reasons... But how dare you harm my brother... CHOE BOK-GEUN 86 1337 026125 Feels so nice. Man-ho, is that money I can smell in the breeze? It sure is, boss. It's coming from Bosung Medical Center. We hit the mother lode with Lee Cho-in. Mr. Lee... How did my brother die? THE LATE MR. OH KANG-CHUL Without suffering? Yes. Without suffering... He left peacefully. What... What was the weather like? A brilliant... A brilliant, sunny day. Good... It was a sunny day. So he must have found himself a nice place. He must have reached the underworld by now. Never... Never again... Never again, will I see him... Are you doing well? I just got my heart ultrasound and... I'm taking my meds on time. But I still can't get used to a world without you. But I'll try. So you won't worry. "Did you sleep well, Seo-yeon?" Even though I no longer get your calls in the morning... Even though I no longer hear your lullaby at night... Even without your laughter, I shall manage somehow. I will. THE LATE MR. LEE CHO-IN Lee Cho-in. I had faith that you'd wait for me. I believed that I was the only one for you. Mr. Oh Kang-ho! A man should never be in the kitchen... Thank you for calling me Oh Kang-ho. Mr. Oh! Who are you? You're really not Lee Cho-in? How do you know my brother Cho-in? I happen to know how he faced his final moments.
