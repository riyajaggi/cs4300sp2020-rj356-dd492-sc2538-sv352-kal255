 My brother Kang-chul... He even took a bullet for me. I don't care if I die. Just tell them to save my brother Kang-chul! So you just want your brother to be treated? Yes. I understand. Easy, easy. You... What is your name? Oh Kang-ho. Oh Kang-chul's younger brother. So... You just want your brother to be treated?

 So, have you confirmed that he's Lee Cho-in? That's not my brother. Ms. Kim Seo-yeon is already in the car. What happens to those... in solitary confinement? They'll be taken back to North Korea in two days. This is commonplace in China. Let me know what happens to this fellow. Certainly. Brother... Lee Cho-in. I'll take my sins to the grave. So don't forgive me. Don't. I'm not giving up on anything. The hospital, myself, or Seo-yeon. Tell us about your family. My father's name is Oh Jung-hoon. My mother's name is Kim Mi-ran. I have an older brother named Oh Kang-chul. Is she really Oh Kang-chul's sister? Yes, polygraph results indicate so. And she was a guide. And here. So she is. And what about Oh Kang-chul? He crossed the border four months ago. No, we don't have him yet. He has such detailed info about North Korean Special Forces. It'd be nice to have him on our side. Let's wrap this up. What will you do now? I have to keep looking. I don't want to regret this time like last time. Back then, you must have wanted me to find you too. Take your meds on time. Oh Kang-chul! Come! You must remember... When you brought Cho-in home... I was five years old. Ever since then... You've never smiled at me. I needed your love, too. I tried so hard to win your love and acceptance. But Cho-in was the apple of your eye. But I won't give in anymore. So... Don't forgive me. Please... Don't forgive me. Did you find Cho-in? It wasn't Cho-in. I see. I figured. It couldn't have been Cho-in. Mr. Oh. We received Cho-in's remains from China yesterday. I'm sorry that things had to end up this way. Where was Cho-in discovered? In the desert. Cho-in was wearing this ring. It looks like a couple's ring. So we can compare that to the matching ring. Mom. Let's prepare Cho-in's funeral. We're set, ma'am. Once we have Cho-in's funeral, we'll bury any issues regarding the ownership of new center. I hope so. It's about time. Yeom, did you join the Security Forces to hunt down refugees? Shut the hell up, you traitorous dog. Is that why you're smuggling flour? To feed the starving people? Shut up, you traitor! Kang-chul... Give me a cigarette at least for beating me up. What was that? You get to smuggle the flour for catching me. Sure, I can spare you a cigarette. Allow me. My hands are already cuffed. Why aren't you smoking? Can you roll down the window? You're getting a big head. Comrade Yeom, sorry about the flour. What? Get them! Oh, Kang-chul, you son of a bitch! MISSING PERSON This is Young-ji, right? Did you find the flyers? There's nothing, not even a trace. Was it a dream? No, I saw them, too. So they gave up on me. They couldn't care less about me. Maybe something happened to them, too. You really think so? We will find them if they can't find you. The phone number in your flyer started with 82. That's the country code for South Korea. Did you find your sister? She went to South Korea. Want to come with me? Salute! MINISTRY OF UNIFICATION Ten steps to a healthy mind. One, think positively. Two, be grateful. It looks good, thank you. You were a political dissident. Did you know my folks by any chance? My dad's name was Oh Jung-hoon. And my mom's was Kim Mi-ran. Do they look familiar? Why are you mentioning that? Are you getting a big head as you're one of the leads? No, it's not that. I was just wondering about my folks. Never mind, we're leaving. You're such a nuisance. Like you're some big shot. I'm sorry. I was just wondering about my folks. We're leaving. It wasn't like that. Man, how did he make it out alive? Curious, are you? Comrade! You're alive, sir. What happened to Gi-seok? The Security Forces killed him. I'm sorry. What did you do with the ice? Here you go. All the buyers disappeared after the shooting incident. I was just keeping it all till I found you. And what about the big boss? The kingpin? He left Shanghai for Tolu. We're going to Tolu. Did they get ambushed because of us? Even the Chinese troops can't come here freely. I've been waiting for you. Don't be so formal. I'd be dead if it weren't for you. I wouldn't be here today. Come in. So this is the end of our deal? Yes. It is. Too bad. It's too bad! Here you go. Boss, this is too much. It's tough for a North Korean refugee. Wherever you get settled, you have to call me. Don't you forget it! Okay. Can I make a phone call? Is this the Security Agency? I called you a few days ago from Shanghai. My name is Oh Kang-chul. I'm a lieutenant in the North Korean Security Forces. Comrade, what are you doing? Turning yourself in to the South Korean authorities? Chi-soo, you're free to go. Do what you want. Is it true that my sister Young-ji is in South Korea? Thank you. I'll join her soon. How can I get to South Korea? I see. Kang-ho, it's our turn now. Hurry up, you've been talking all day. Hi, this is Young-ji. Yes, I'm fine. I'm learning to drive and to become a baker. Once I'm certified, I'll find plenty of work. When I graduate, they'll give me an apartment and $3,000. Yes, I'm rich now. You know about the favor... What, my brother came by? That was really Kang-chul? Thank you so much. I'll call you again. Thanks so much again. My brother's coming to South Korea. Good for you. And call me if you ever get to Korea. Mr. Lee, how have you been? My brother Kang-chul is coming here from China. And I'll soon be out and about. In a few days, I will even have my citizen's ID. Can I go see you then? For Gi-seok and Gi-baek? What do you think happened to them? They must have gone back home. Back to the home they left while they were alive. Will I be able to go back home, too? You must live. You grabbed my ankles unconsciously out in the desert. You wanted to live. You were left for dead after being shot. You must live to uncover the truth. Live, Kang-ho. We can't let our comrades have died in vain. You think I can find everything again? In South Korea... The ones I loved and the reasons why I was abandoned? You must. You must. Look after yourself. We'll kill those rats today. Move. This isn't the way towards the river. But it is, Comrade. No, something doesn't smell right. This goes back to China. Why did you suddenly decide to join us? You wanted to bring your family to China. I could never fool you, sir. I have no plans to go to South Korea. Kang-chul! Kang-chul... Too many shots... No, you're okay. It's okay... What are you talking about? I'll save you, so don't give up. I've been in enough combat to know what's up. Take care of Young-ji... No, you look after your own sister. Oh, Kang-ho... Stop talking so I can stop the bleeding! There's not much time! This is my sister Oh Young-ji... I saw her five years ago... So she's 25 now. She was the apple of my parents' eyes. But I couldn't protect her. South Korean authorities will be waiting for you. They'll help you find my sister. Go. I can't leave you behind. We're leaving together. And look after Young-ji on my behalf. You said we have to live. We can't let our comrades have died in vain! Just go, already! Kang-ho, live and go on. And look after Young-ji on my behalf. Hello? Seo-yeon, this is Park Su-rak. Hi, Su-rak. Long time no speak. Where are you? In Shanghai. But I'm now going to Shanxi Province. So you haven't heard the news? What news? Cho-in is back. He is? Yes, but... THE LATE MR. LEE CHO-IN Bosung Medical Center, please. Hello. I'm here to see Dr. Lee Cho-in. Dr. Lee Cho-in? Yes, I'm Oh Young-ji from China. Can I see him? The patient is suffering from fractured ribs. Have the patient admitted. Yes, ma'am. Aren't you going to see Cho-in? Why should I go? I never saw his body. Why would I go see a pile of ashes? THE LATE MR. LEE CHO-IN COFFIN DATE: MARCH 2 THE LATE MR. LEE CHO-IN What are you doing? What do you guys think you're doing? What's Cho-in doing there? He hasn't even come back yet. Seo-yeon. I'm still looking for Cho-in. So you can't do this. What if I find Cho-in? Kim Seo-yeon. Sun-woo, this isn't right. We have to wait. Even if the rest of the world says frightening things... You and I should wait for him. Take the flowers away. And Cho-in's picture! What will it take for you to accept it? Will this do it? Can you accept it now? I figured that if I found you, I'd find Cho-in, too. I thought maybe he disappeared with you. So I even resented you. I'm sorry, Young-ji. No, I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I should've accompanied him to the airport. I should've watched him board the plane. How was he when you saw him for the last time? He was worried about his father's surgery. He said he had to rush back to Korea. I thought he was already here. So why did he go to the desert? They found him in the desert... With the ring. What was he doing in the desert? He must have been... so cold and lonely. I should get going. I'm sorry, I'm not myself. Not at all... I'd just come to say hi since I was in Korea. Don't worry about me. Young-ji... Can we meet one of these days? I'd like to hear about Cho-in. You were the last person to have seen him. Could you do that? Yes, sure. Thank you. This guy is a hustler on the run. And when the job is done, I'll throw in another 10,000 yuan. Where is Lee Cho-in? Oh Young-ji, I know you're an illegal North Korean immigrant. He went to the hospital. Mr. Lee, it wasn't because of me, was it? Tell me it wasn't. Seo-yeon! -Seo-yeon! -Kim Seo-yeon! Hurry! Come on! Seo-yeon, hurry! Kim Seo-yeon! Hurry! Cho-in. Sun-woo. Kim Seo-yeon! Are you lost again? Cho-in. You klutz. Got another melody in your head? You're still just a big kid. You can daydream when you're with me. Just hold on tight. I'm a pretty cool guy. Why not write a song about me? You and your incurable narcissism. At least I don't get lost. Here we go, babe. Sparrow. Chirp, chirp. Duck. Quack, quack. Goldfish. Cho-in? Cho-in! Sun-woo. Cho-in's not coming back. Cho-in can't come back. What do I do? How will I live? When I disappeared, how did you make it? Thinking about that might make it easier. Don't say such things. You're scaring me. What I did to forget you... The hell I endured... And I have to forget Cho-in, too? You're scaring me. Accept what you can't change. Do so for the person who gave you a heart and love. I'm sorry, Seo-yeon. You're hurting, but only for today. I won't hurt you ever again. Ever... Sit down. Did you file for his death certificate? Yes, I just returned from the City Hall. Everything should be official by now. Thank you, ma'am. So whatever belonged to Cho-in now belongs to you and the Director. I suppose so. Since Lee Cho-in no longer exists. So we don't need a board meeting? Of course not. And about Kim Hyun-ju? We'll make sure she doesn't bring up the project of the Emergency Center ever again. When I go to Korea, will you see me? So you're never coming back? I made it all the way here... And I'll never see you again? PERSONNEL CHANGE This is so wrong. KIM HYUN-JU RELOCATED TO CHEONG-JU AFFILIATE I've been looking all over for you. Answer your phone. So you saw the notice? Yes. Our kind Vice-Director sent me a personal fax. She's one tough broad. Sure, it's not her real son's funeral. But she had to do that at a time like this. But now is actually a good time for her. Everyone's focused on Cho-in. She can get rid of everyone opposed to the Neurosurgery Center. Is it that hard to change an emergency room to a full center? You don't say. Let's go. Where? I should say goodbye to Cho-in before I go to Cheong-ju. If you only hadn't said you'd will the hospital to Cho-in, none of this would have happened to you or Cho-in. I hope you're satisfied. I hope you are! You may leave the plane now. Please check your claim tickets when you pick up your luggage. Thank you. Kang-chul, do you see? This is the Republic of Korea you so wanted to see. I'll find everything. The ones I loved... The reason why I was left for dead... And your sister, Oh Young-ji. I'll find them all. So Kang-ho is here? Mr. Oh Kang-chul is here, too. You killed Oh Kang-chul, right? -No. -Bring him in. Yes, he shot and killed Oh Kang-chul. I'll kill you! Happy birthday to you! I am sorry, Cho-in. I am so sorry, my little brother. Let me meet with Oh Young-ji. That's my last request.
