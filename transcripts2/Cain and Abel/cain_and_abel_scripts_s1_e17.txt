 You're not worried about how she's feeling now, are you? What did you tell Seo-yeon? You want to know what she found out? Then go ask her yourself. You can't, can you? Then just accept it. Lee Sun-woo, don't ever come near Kim Seo-yeon again. If you do, I'll make sure you never hold a scalpel. What? You don't think I can do that? Seo-yeon! Seo-yeon. DEAR CHO-IN

 SUN-WOO IS ILL. HE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME. YOU FIX HIM. YOU'RE A GOOD SURGEON. You even went to a defector prison camp to look for me? Yes. With Sun-woo. I didn't find my brother I was looking for there. There were just some defected soldiers and an amnesia patient. No way, Kim Seo-yeon. You can't ever marry Sun-woo. Lee Sun-woo, I'll make you say it yourself. Your call is being forwarded to... Seo-yeon, it's me. Call me. I'll be waiting. Then meet me at 6:00 in the lobby, okay? Lee Cho-in. You jerk. Don't you remember how Sun-woo raised you? He loved you, he adored you. He loved you more than I hated you. How can you betray your brother? -Mother. -"Mother"? You deceitful jerk. Wasn't it enough that you hogged the director's love? You conspired and swindled the land off of your old man. And that was not good enough. So you humiliated your brother in front of everyone? Why did you do that? Why? Don't you dare call my son brother! You jerk. You think you can build the Emergency Medical Center because you have that shitty piece of paper? I'll do whatever it takes to stop you. You just wait and see. Mother... you know what? I wanted to be a son to you... like Sun-woo was to you. How dare you say you're my son? Don't even dream about it, you jerk. Dr. Lee. Young-ji, we were supposed to meet at the lobby. Let's go look at the city lights together. No. I have a bad headache. I think I need to rest. Really? Let me see. You don't have a fever. -Sit down. -It's okay. I'm all right. I think I just need a good night's sleep. -Are you sure? -Yes. Give me a minute. Take this. And get lots of sleep. I'm really all right. I'll take it later. Get some rest. I'll be at the ER. Okay. You're the one who's not feeling well... not me. After hearing such words from your mother... you must be heartbroken. LEE CHO-IN MY SON BUILD EMERGENCY CENTER Lee Jong-min, who do you think you are? You're cornering your one and only son into a deadly situation. But how dare you adore Cho-in this much? Why? Why? You were always like this. You're responsible for what happened to Sun-woo. You made me kill Cho-in's parents, but you completely ignored our situation. You adopted Cho-in without consulting me, and you left Sun-woo and me to face the consequences. Lee Jong-min... I shouldn't have revived you when you collapsed. I shouldn't let our 30 years together cloud my judgment. Be it 30 minutes or three hours, I should've left you to die! Die now. You die if you're going to let Sun-woo die like this. You die! You made me kill Cho-in's parents. Be it 30 minutes or three hours, I should've left you to die! Dad. Dad, can you hear me? Dad! Mother, how long has he been like this? I'm not sure. He came in around 1:30 to take a nap so... I think it's been 30 minutes at most. You didn't know he was unconscious for a whole 30 minutes? Lee Cho-in, I just told you. I thought he was taking a nap. Are you saying you don't believe me? I'm sorry. Hurry. Take him to CT and call Neurosurgery. Dear Cho-in, Sun-woo is ill. That's the reason he couldn't come back seven years ago. So don't hate him. You fix him. You're a neurosurgeon, too. Kim Seo-yeon. Don't come close. Just stay there and answer me. Was it you? Did you do that? Did you... really try to harm Cho-in? Seo-yeon. It was you. Yes, you did it. How... How could you do something so terrible? You, of all people... to Cho-in, to our Cho-in?! Yes, I did. I abandoned Cho-in. Because if I didn't... I couldn't have you. What? What little time I have left in my life... I didn't want Cho-in to take you away. It was so difficult to be alone.... for the past seven years. Even if I became a murderer... even if I ended up in Hell... I thought I'd be okay if I could spend the rest of my life with you. You shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have done that. I know. I know I shouldn't, but I did. When I left Cho-in in that dark solitary confinement, I told myself... I'd take the punishment for it. Lee Sun-woo... even if you had such evil thoughts, you should've said to me you didn't do it. You should've denied it until the end! Kim Seo-yeon.... I wanted to live... and die... in your arms. You shouldn't have done such things... if you really loved me. I'm sorry. Are you satisfied, Lee Cho-in? Are you absolutely satisfied? Lee Cho-in. I can't die like this. Not like this. THE ARCHIVE MEDICAL RECORDS PATIENT NAME: CHOE YUN-HEE TRIAGE IN ER PATIENT NAME: LEE JIN-SUNG TRIAGE IN ER PATIENT 33 WEEKS PREGNANT You made me kill Cho-in's parents, but you completely ignored our situation. I can't forgive her. Is it time to get started? What's this? ER records from 1979. From 1979. What about these? You said you knew my late parents well, right? And that's why you've always liked me. How did my parents die? I heard they got into a car accident. Your parents had invested all their savings in this hospital and couldn't even go on a honeymoon when they'd been married for seven years. And when the Director Lee Jong-min, their close friend from medical school joined the hospital, they finally had some time to go on a trip. With you in your mother's womb. But they got into a car accident. What was the cause of the accident? I don't know. It's been over 30 years. But why are you asking all of a sudden? I was just curious. Excuse me. I came to pick up an auto accident record from 1979. -You called yesterday, right? -That's right. You have any identification to prove you're a family member? Hold on a second. -Here you go. -Thank you. DATE OF ACCIDENT NOVEMBER 15, 1979 OWNER OF VEHICLE 1 LEE JIN-SUNG CAUSE OF ACCIDENT BRAKE FAILURE DUE TO BRAKE FLUID LEAKAGE The number of your staff has been reduced. Cho-in, why are you doing this to us? What did we do wrong? I'm sure your director knows that. Don't you? -Doctor Nam. -I'm sorry. We're left with the best and brightest doctors, thanks to you. Lee Sun-woo. Seo-yeon... what did you do to her? I told her everything. What? Lee Sun-woo... are you out of your mind? Didn't you say you'd make me tell her myself? Why are you getting angry when you got what you wanted? How could you do that to Seo-yeon? Didn't you know how devastated she'd be? Don't be an arrogant jerk. You're the one who brought things this far. What? Lee Cho-in, there was a silent agreement between us. You should've left Seo-yeon alone. I'll make you also feel... the pain Seo-yeon is feeling. I'll make you regret it. Your family's the one who broke our agreement first. I'll never... ever forgive your family. You have no idea what I'm saying? You'll find out soon enough. Don't forgive me. That's exactly what I want. We're going back up now. Let's see what we made now. Ready? One, two, three. Try this at home with your mom. -Yes! -Yes. Seo-yeon, I had hoped you'd never find out. But you've found out everything now, didn't you? Kim Seo-yeon, I've trusted all of your decisions until now, but not this time. You can never marry Lee Sun-woo. It's the CT scan of your brain taken with a linear accelerator. The size of the tumor... hasn't decreased at all. Although there's no change in its size, there's a sign of necrosis and edema in the surrounding area. Then you're saying... my tumor's possibly advanced to grade 4? -We'll need more tests to be-- -All right. You may leave. Lee Sun-woo... you no longer... have a room to retreat. Twenty people? Thank you. Okay. What is it? You got something? Yes, I finally got my first Chinese medical tour group. -Congratulations. -Thank you. But I haven't seen Drs. Lee Sun-woo or Lee Cho-in around for days now. They don't come to have lunch with you anymore. Is there any problem? No. I guess they're busy. I thought you broke up. Keep up the good work. That's for you. Broke up with what? You'll be fine. Don't worry. Dr. Lee. Young-ji. What is it? Pick. Pick whatever you want to eat. What's gotten into you, Miss Stingy? What's the special occasion? I got my first Chinese medical tour group. So I'm getting a bonus. I owe it to you so it's my treat today. That's good enough. You can't work with that alone. A man needs to have a full stomach to overcome any obstacles. You want this? Doesn't this look delicious? This also looks good. Let's try this, too. Young-ji, you don't have to do this. Huh? I'm fine so you don't have to worry about me. Will you really be okay? Yes. Can you take good care of my father instead of me? I'm kind of busy these days. So you tend on him, please? Yes. Don't worry. Go in. Your patients must be waiting for you. Bye for now. Young-ji... when's your medical tour group coming? The day after tomorrow. I have a board meeting on that day. I'm off tomorrow. You want to go somewhere with me? Where? Why do you ask so many questions? Just do what I say, okay? Bye. I don't think I'm helping you. I think I'm just being a burden on you. Miss Oh Young-ji, since your Chinese medical tour group is going to be our first group of Chinese clients, I want to give them a good impression. Will you escort them on the city tour? I'm sorry to bother you like this. It's okay. I'll do it. Where shall I take them to? Hi. This is the list of board members who promised support us at the upcoming board meeting. But I don't understand why it's so complicated since the land is owned by Cho-in now. You think we can put up a tent on that land and call it an Emergency Medical Center? It'll cost a lot of money to build the center, buy equipment, and hire the staff. Got it. The board has the right to decide the hospital budget. So this board meeting is very important. Okay, and the problem? The problem is we don't have enough number of board members on our side. Including Cho-in, Choi Dong-ryul, Kang Dong-il, Kim Seok-jun, and myself, we don't even have half of the votes. Besides, we can't even completely trust them. Now I miss that rat Jo Hyun-taig. He used to take our side once in a while. Lee Cho-in, do you have any plan? Our corporate attorney and the Chief of Planning stopped by the director's room this morning. Why? They promised to support the Emergency Medical Center. -Really? -Wow! Lee Cho-in, we could win if we can count on their votes. Wait a minute, why did they go out for lunch together with Ms. Nah a while ago? What? They went to the Japanese restaurant across the street. They were never interested in a fair game. We'll play the same way they're playing. What does he mean? I'm sure he has something up his sleeve, right? I hope so. Even having the land's ownership, getting an approval from the board members is a whole different ballgame. Did you read this book or not? It's lying around everywhere. Why Do You Think I'm Guilty? Dr. Kim. I'm sure you were all quite shocked at the last board meeting, but there's nothing to worry about. I still have the real power of this hospital, and the Neurosurgery Center will proceed as scheduled. What good is the ownership of the property when there is no funds to build the center? Don't you agree? As she said, the Emergency Medical Center is a lost cause. So don't be swayed anymore. Just give your votes to our vice-director tomorrow! Let's drink to that. Will the Neurosurgery Center, which started with an issue of moral deficiency, be successful? He's right. The number of patients of the Neurosurgery Center has decreased by 60% since the case conference. And more than half of the scheduled surgeries have been cancelled. So? It seems Director Lee is slowly recovering. Maybe we should build the Emergency Medical Center as the director desired. I don't think that's what you're supposed to say as a long-time beneficiary of my constant support? That's right. Come on. I'm relaying the decisions of all the board members. We went to the director's room this morning and promised our support to Dr. Lee Cho-in. Please excuse us. Vice-Director, what if we lose the vote? What happened to Mr. Oh? Get in touch with him. All right. Father, does it feel good? I never had proper training, but I've seen the professionals do it a hundred times while I was working as a tour guide in China. Father... I'll give you a massage every day so please get better soon and give a big hug to Dr. Lee Cho-in. He doesn't show it outside, but I can see he's having a hard time. Really? Dr. Lee. Then why don't you give me a hug when I'm having a hard time? What are you saying in front of your father? I should go now. Father, good night. Dad... I don't know why Young-ji feels more like family to me. Seo-yeon, I had hoped you'd never find out. But you've found out everything now, didn't you? Kim Seo-yeon, I've trusted all your decisions until now, but not this time. You can never marry Lee Sun-woo. Dr. Lee, where are we going? Isn't it too early for viewing the city nightscape? We're not going to look down at the city now. Then where are we going? You said Hamgyeongbukdo is your hometown, right? Yes. I know you can't see your hometown, but you can see some of North Korea from here. Your family must be there in the distance, right? Yes, my mom and dad must be there. I wonder what kind of people your parents are. They're both warm and kind people. I'm sure. That's why you and Kang-chul... you're both good people. Young-ji, you've been worried about me, right? Everything will be over tomorrow. Then... would you like to have a family with me? Oh, my head. He's still conscious. When did the headache start? I think it's subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cistern. It must be a ruptured artery, right? I also see an enhanced mass in the skull base midline. We should tend on the aneurysm rupture first, and do an MRI later. Then let's transfer him to another hospital. What did you say? Things are not good around the center these days. The rumor's out that we botch our surgeries. We might just get blamed if anything goes wrong. -Call another hospital. -What do you think you're doing? Director Lee. This is... chordoma? How is his mental state? He had syncope 40 minutes ago, but he's alert now. Do an MRI. We need to do an MRI just to fix an aneurysm rupture? Dr. Shin... you think just fixing what's visible to the eye will fix the source of the patient's problem? And you still call yourself a doctor? Why would we build an Emergency Medical Center if that's how you take care of a patient? I'm sorry. Dr. Nam, call Dr. Kang and book an operating room. -I'll do the surgery. -Yes, sir. Dr. Lee, did you forget the MRI images I gave you? It's possible your condition has advanced to grade 4. It's recurring astrocytoma. So the grade doesn't matter. Your seizures have become worse, right? And it's happening more frequently. But you want to do a surgery in your condition? Kang Seok-hoon, this patient has chordoma, just like the director. And he also has an aneurysm like the one Lee Cho-in operated on first. With this surgery being successful, we can improve the center's reputation and prove my surgery style wasn't wrong. And you expect me to give up on this surgery? I can't agree to it. Kang Seok-hoon! Are you saying you can't agree with my surgery style? No, I agree with your surgery style. But as your doctor, I have a duty and the privilege -to stop you from doing this surgery. -Is that so? Then you're fired as my doctor. Doctor! Kang Seok-hoon... this is an anti-seizure drug. It'll pull me through this surgery. I need your help. I can't. Sun-woo! Are you all right? I need to... go into surgery. No. No, Sun-woo. Surgery... No. No. OPERATION TIME 06:53 What? Lee Sun-woo operated on a chordoma patient? When? Lee Cho-in! I was behind everything, you know. I put Ms. Choe Yu-rah on that flight and had Sun-woo operate on her. Mr. Oh and I ordered your kidnapping in China. It was you and Mr. Oh? Yes. I did it. Because I hated you for taking everything away from Sun-woo. So I masterminded the whole thing. Did you hate me that much? Enough to hire people to kidnap and kill me? Yes. I hated you. I hated you to death. And I, who hated you that much... am begging you now. Back out so Sun-woo can have his Neurosurgery Center. No, I can't do that. What? Lee Cho-in! I wanted to be a son to you, too. But I wasn't a son to you. Don't you want to know what Lee Sun-woo, the son you adore, did to me? What? Vice-Director Nah Hae-ju! just as you, who I've wanted to call mother for 30 years, killed my parents, Lee Sun-woo tried to kill me, too. What? Did you want this hospital so much that you killed my parents and even tried to kill their son? Yes. Yes, I did it. I killed your parents. But Sun-woo didn't do anything wrong. Don't hold him responsible for my sins! Ask your son whether he tried to kill me... or not... yourself. Sun-woo. Lee Cho-in, are you crazy?! Sun-woo... Mom. Sun-woo... Sun-woo... you didn't, right? Cho-in was lying, right? Mom. You're a good boy. My Sun-woo is such a good boy. You tell me. Tell me what a good boy our Sun-woo is! Please! Lee Cho-in... What is family? Family... What is family? Why is Lee Cho-in... still alive? Don't worry. He won't die an easy death. Let him die... in agony... in a very painful way. Young-ji... I'm... having a hard time. The Emergency Medical Center has to be built. This is your last chance. Nobody will get hurt if you give up now. Oh Kang-ho, long time no see! Choi Chi-soo. Young-ji became prettier since she came to Seoul. Lee Sun-woo, did you? I told you nobody will get hurt if you give up on the Emergency Medical Center. Then will you give up on Oh Young-ji instead? -I can't give up. -We're the police. Dr. Lee Cho-in, you're under arrest for the murder of Choe Bok-geun and Yang Man-ho.
