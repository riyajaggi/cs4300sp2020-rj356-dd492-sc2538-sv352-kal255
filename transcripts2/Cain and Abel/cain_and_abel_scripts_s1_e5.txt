 CHINA HAS LOST. THE DRAGON SHALL LEAVE. You traitor! Put your gun down! Now! Run! You traitorous dog. You've got nowhere to run. How dare you set me up! Get them! Over there. We should split up. Stay safe, Kang-ho. Hey. Kang-ho!

 Kang-ho! MISSING PERSON LEE CHO-IN MISSING PERSON LEE CHO-IN Comrade Oh. Didn't you hear me? What were you doing in a trance? Oh, Kang-chul, you traitor, I finally got you. Police! Drop your weapons! We're Security Officers from North Korea. A warrant was issued... by your own government. We'll take them. No, we'll take them. They fled our country! We have permission from your authorities. No, not when it's a drug deal. We'll take them. Take them! I'm going back to Korea. Your heart ultrasound didn't look good. Take your meds on time. I have spoken to the Foreign Ministry about Cho-in. Tired of it already? It's only been two months. You want to hand it over to someone else? I have to check on something and I'll be back. Is the hospital that important to you? We don't even know if Cho-in is alive... Don't you think this is more important than your hospital? My matter is as important as finding Cho-in. My life.... What's left of my life... depends on it. I was delusional for a while. I've forgotten how selfish you are, you stupid egoist. Goodbye. Oh, mister... The issue regarding the transfer of ownership by the Director has to be taken care of quickly behind Sun-woo's back. He's already got his hands full with the Neurosurgery Center. Once Cho-in's death becomes official, the rights of ownership goes back to the Director. Then you and Sun-woo can make the decisions on behalf of the Director. I'll give a call to China and wrap everything up. What about Kim Hyun-ju? Has she been summoned to the ethics committee? Yes, she's currently under investigation. A few missing materia medica will be enough to expel her? I threw in a few antipsychotics as also missing. Theft? Please watch your words. I am the Chief of ER. I wouldn't steal a few drugs. Oh? Explain this. At 11:20 pm on November 10th, you signed off on some medications. November 10th? The 10th? Taking all those meds to pay for your flight to China? Come on, I didn't take that many. Take some more antitussive and betadine. Really? We clearly see your signature right here. These drugs were not used in the ER. What happened? Quite a bit of morphine and Demerol is missing, too. What? I only did.... Dr. Kim, are these the facts? Yes. They are. I see. The ethics committee will notify you. You may go. Why didn't you tell them the truth... that it was for Cho-in's volunteer mission in China? Oh, well, they had the facts. Come on... not likely! You didn't want to sell out Cho-in. But how long will you take this? Dr. Kim, let's play our trump card. The one from the Director's private attorney. I guess we should. Here's a cardiogram of an emergency patient. Say it's a ventricular fibrillation. What would you do, Su-rak? Well... I'd inject epinephrine. And I'd keep massaging the heart. If there's no improvement in the results, I'd inject more-- -Next. -Yes? What would you do? Well... I'd do the same as Su-rak. Is this a joke? This is a typical torsades de pointes! No one here knows what to do? Magnesium should be injected in five percent dextrose water. Dr. Nam is the only one? We got the go-ahead for the Neurosurgery Center two months ago. And Dr. Nam is the only one... trained to do advanced cardiovascular life support? And you want to be members of the staff at my medical center? Just forget it. NEUROSURGERY Dr. Lee. Dr. Kang Seok-hoon. I just returned from the States. So, you're finally here. This hospital can use some help. I feel the adrenaline rush. Yes, there's a lot you can do in my place. Mister! Stop smoking those damn things. We can't breathe in here! Think about the rest of us. But it's such a long boring trip for the last three days. And those people told us it's supposed to be a short ride. Man, the stench! I told you not to go on the floor and to tell us! Who has to use the john? You! You first. Okay. What happened to the other girl who went to the restroom? I paid for everything, so what do you want? Isn't it obvious? Your body. We're almost in South Korea, don't you want to go there? Don't come near me. If you do... What are you going to do? You're going to beat me? Stay away! Or I'll jump! Fine. Jump. It's your life. Stay away, I'll jump. Bring the gaff! Where are they taking us? Probably to the military prison. I heard North Korean refugees are taken there before they're sent back to North Korea. Comrade Oh. This scar... Have I always had it? Was it there when you saved me? Yes. The man in the picture... The smiling man... Does he have a scar like this, too? Was that me? Or someone who just looks like me? Afraid of what you might remember? Is that why you didn't say you weren't North Korean? I don't know... who I am... or what I'm supposed to do. I have no clue. Get out! Hurry up! Out! Get out! Keep walking! Stand up straight! You have to be disinfected! Are you okay? I'm fine. Stop! Stop it, you jerks! IDENTITY INFORMATION OH KANG-CHUL North Korean Security Forces? Yes. How interesting... Can you handle it? Comrade. Comrade Oh. Thanks to all that water... the wound must be clean now. Comrade. Comrade Oh! Help! Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Hey. Someone's dying. Someone's dying. Hey, you jerks! Forget it. They don't consider us human. This fellow has the look of a security officer. Yes, he is... Then he's as good as dead. A North Korean security officer tried to escape last year. The warden here nearly lost his job. Since then, not a single soldier has made it out alive. He'll be pitted against the strongest guard tomorrow. And he's not going to stay alive. Have you made your decision? Yes. The Leksell Stereotactic System. And do an awake surgery. But then you will have incredible pain. I don't have much time. I want to see my brain with my own eyes. Jung-min. Look how the mighty have fallen. You're all skin and bone. What brings you here? I made up an excuse to come see you. No news from Cho-in? Not yet. It's been two and a half months. If he was kidnapped or in an accident, you would've heard by now. Where's Sun-woo? You aren't looking for Cho-in together? He went back to Korea. And aren't you going back? Jung-min. I know that this must be hard for you. But being emotional isn't going to resolve anything. No, I can find him. I will find him. How long will you be looking for? As long as you had looked for Sun-woo? Kim Seo-yeon. You made it through Sun-woo's disappearance. -Lee Jung-min-- -Hear me out! Yes, I made it... because of Cho-in. Then Cho-in must have a reason why he can't come back. Just like Sun-woo did. Like Sun-woo did? What do you mean? He didn't say anything to you? Well, it'd be something if that man ever opened up. I'm telling you this now. Sun-woo was sick. What? When you had a heart transplant seven years ago, it's not that Sun-woo didn't come back. He couldn't. He was seriously ill. Do you have the coordinates? Yes. 143, 64, 99, for X, Y, Z, respectively. We rounded up. Can we begin? Yes. We'll apply the local anesthesia... Lidocaine. Scalpel. Drill. The needle is going in. He's fast. He must be the best runner at an upcoming hospital track meet. Well, the crap has hit the fan. It better work out this time. First things, first. Then we'll look for Lee Cho-in and help the Director recover. It's all we can do for now. Where could he be? We have a situation. What's with the big fuss? An emergency board meeting has been requested. An emergency board meeting? REQUEST FOR BOARD MEETING To disband the construction project of the Neurosurgery Center. And who requested this meeting? Dr. Kim Jin-geun from the Anesthesiology. So Kim Hyun-ju must have put him up to it. She's grasping at straws, so why bother? You don't understand, Mr. Oh. Hyun-ju knows that the ownership of new center belongs to Cho-in. We were privy to that info, but how does she know? How did it get out! The attorney visited the Director before he came to us. They must have met there. I know only because Jo Hyun-taig told me. Mr. Oh. Don't worry, we'll hear from China soon. Boss, you want us to find Lee Cho-in's corpse? It's already been a few months. We won't have to look very far. Boss, you asked for me? Wasn't that Lee Cho-in's ring? No, it's mine. This is for the ring. Young-ji, you're awake. Is that you, Jin-ho? Seo Jin-ho from school? Yes. Where are we? Are we back in China? No, we're in Seoul, in South Korea. Seoul? SHARE YOUR HOPES AND PAIN WITH US You're awake, Ms. Oh Young-ji. They're government officials. Welcome to the Republic of Korea. Could you come with us for a debriefing? Mom, Dad, Kang-chul, I'm in Korea. I got here first, so join me soon. Please. Old timer, what happened to my friend? You were knocked out. He's fighting in your place. Fighting? When a North Korean soldier comes here, the warden pits him against the strongest guard here. You friend took up the challenge instead of you. If he wins, you're going to receive medical treatment. From the ruckus, it seems that he's not dead yet. Oh, Kang-ho! Stop the fight! He's not a soldier! I'm the North Korean soldier! You're next! Continue. Comrade, stop. Stop! I wanted to do this... I wanted to do it! I'll fight! So leave my comrade alone! Comrade... I can't just keep letting you help me. I'll finish this fight... Kang-ho, remember this. You save lives, so you know the critical point in the body. Hit him where you aren't supposed to. Otherwise, you can't beat him. Kang-ho... Oh, Kang-ho! Beat them up and confine them. Kang-ho. Kang-ho. Don't touch my brother... We have the biopsy results. It's a stellate cell like seven years ago. What grade? Grade 3 by WHO standards. So it's not at grade 4 yet? No. The tumor is in your left prefrontal area. Edema is in the precentral gyrus. So surgery could mean... that I'd no longer have a normal life. The tumor's growing quickly. Do you want surgery or radiation-- Could you... give me some time? KIM SEO-YEON Hi. I think we can find Cho-in. I found out where he is. Brother... Kang-chul... Good job. Cho-in's body has been discarded. It'll become official in three days. Have a board meeting, and the game is over. Hi, Sun-woo. Mom, I think we found Cho-in. What? We found out where he is. I'm on my way there. I'll call you when I get back. What's all this about Cho-in being alive? Pardon? Sun-woo is on his way to meet Cho-in. Lee Cho-in is alive! How did you find out? Someone tipped off Ms. Kim Seo-yeon. We haven't heard from the authorities yet. And where is Ms. Kim? She's waiting over there. Seo-yeon, I don't have much time. We're leaving in ten minutes. I have to tell you something. Will you hear me out? If it's about seven years ago, you don't have to say anything. Jung-min told me. Are you better now? Yes, I'm all better. Good, as long as you're better. What a relief, I was so worried. If I had come back then... and I had told you... Sun-woo, let's not reopen old wounds. Let's go find Cho-in together. That'll fix everything. Yes, if we just find Cho-in... That will fix... things. Hi, Mom. Where are you? Did you find Cho-in? We're on our way, I'll call you... Wait! Listen to me. Listen to me first. You must not find Cho-in! What do you mean? The ownership of Neurosurgery Center transferred to Cho-in. What? Lee Jong-min, your father, has given the rights to Cho-in. You must not find Cho-in. If he comes back, everything will be lost. Where are you? I'll send you the fax so you can see it. Then decide whether you want to find him or not. I see. REGISTRATION OF OWNERSHIP TRANSFER I, Lee Jong-min, hereby bequeath all the rights of any additional medical center to my son, Lee Cho-in. Tell me you are not there, Lee Cho-in. Tell me you aren't. I might have to kill you. Are you okay, Sun-woo? So, this is everyone? Is this everyone? Yes. That can't be right. I was told he was here. They told me he was here. Ms. Kim. No. Don't say he's not here. He's here somewhere. Here. Take a good look at this. Look. This is Lee Cho-in. You've seen him, haven't you? Take a look. This is Lee Cho-in. Have you seen him? Have you seen him? I have more photos of him. Say something! I know that Cho-in is here! I'll look for him, so calm down. But if he's not here, where could he be? What if we never find him? Please find him for me, Sun-woo. You can do it because you went away once like him, right? Why do you guys do this to me? Please stop! Seo-yeon. Seo-yeon! Kim Seo-yeon! Where's the infirmary? Open. What are you doing! THE LATE MR. LEE CHO-IN
