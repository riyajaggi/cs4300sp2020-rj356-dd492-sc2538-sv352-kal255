 EPISODE 14 Don't play dumb. You're Kang-ho. You might die if you don't get surgery... ...in 30 minutes. So I'm going to open up your head... ...and operate on you. I'll kill you! You know what this is for, better than I do. And Oh Young-ji made this just for your sake. You're scaring me.

 What has this person done? Kang-chul didn't save your life for this. Not for you to become a murderer... I don't care who the patient is. Kill him and prove to me you've been faking amnesia. Why are you here when we have two neurosurgeons on duty? We have no time to wait. I'll do it. Works for me. We'll now begin an emergency operation on the subdural hematoma patient. Scalpel. Drilling burr hole. Open the bone flap and approach the area through the midline. -What? -Doctor.

 Dr. Lee, don't you think you're rushing? I've been in the business for over a decade, and I don't think there's a need for a rush job. If you approach the midline covered with bone fragments and cut the coronal sinus -he can go into shock from bleeding. -Neurotome. Fine, do what you will. I see the dura. More suction. Doctor, the clot has grown larger and closer to the midline. We might damage his coronal sinus. Dr. Lee, let's go easy. Okay? Hey, more irrigation. We might get a medical accident on our hands at this rate. Dr. Lee, let's go slow, okay? What if you can't control the bleeding? Yes, do rupture his coronal sinus. Lee Cho-in... Rupture his artery and show me you've been faking the amnesia. Doctor, I think I found the ruptured bridging vein. You did? No damage to the coronal sinus? Get bipolar. The bleeding's stopped. We have the bleeding under control. Let's take our time now and patch him up. Take your time? I thought we were going to have a major accident. I'm barely alive. You can't die before you go on a date with Dr. Kim Hyun-ju. Why are you bringing her up here? You're the man. Dr. Lee, the Director was here. Sun-woo? Yes, he was shooting laser beams from his eyes, watching every move you made. You can close him up, right? I'll be right back. How was it? I was so scared I almost peed my pants. I really thought Dr. Lee was getting into an accident. Close him up. Sun-woo. Why didn't you tell me you were there? What did you think? I was awesome, wasn't I? Even a third-year resident can do surgery like that. Really? I guess so. Sun-woo, have you been to Cheong-ju lately? Cheong-ju? Why do you ask? Someone saw you there. Were you there? Who told you that? Well... Maybe I saw you. What? Don't look so shocked. I talked to Dr. Kim Hyun-ju. She said you stopped by the affiliate hospital. I'll go finish the job. Mr. Choe. Finish the job. CHEONG-JU THE PERSON THAT MADE THE ORDER TO KILL ME Finish the job. It must be wrapped up in Cheong-ju. CAR ACCIDENT Dr. Lee Cho-in, I'm calling from the ICU. Your subdural hematoma patient just woke up. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT Oh Kang-ho, I mean Lee Cho-in. I'll pay Oh Young-ji back for saving my life. What happened to the patient? He was just here. Is he not there? Seo Jin-ho, why are you late again? You have another delivery. Comrade Oh Young-ji, how have you been? How did you... find me here? Kang-ho... I mean Lee Cho-in told me. MR. LEE CHO-IN The number you're calling is currently unavailable... Choi Chi-soo! Young-ji, please pick up. Hello? Mr. Lee Cho-in. Young-ji. Mr. Lee. Young-ji. Yes, Mr. Lee. This is Oh Young-ji. What are you doing now? I'm working now. Right. You said you run a snack bar at night. I'm feeling a bit hungry, too. Do you do delivery to Seoul? Oh my, I won't even make gas money. -Young-ji. -Yes, Mr. Lee. I have an urgent matter. Can I see you tomorrow? What is it? I have to go into surgery now so I can't talk long. I'll tell you when I see you tomorrow. Okay? See you tomorrow. Dr. Lee. Dr. Lee. What's this urgent matter? Where to next? Young-ji, are you really not going to buy me a scooter? I might just kill myself or become a cyclist. Jin-ho, take tomorrow off. Really? We're not going to open tomorrow? No. I'm going to Seoul. Seoul? Yes, Seoul. CHOI CHI-SOO Choi Chi-soo, even if you were a Special Forces soldier, you couldn't have walked in your condition. Where did you go? Choi Chi-soo... Grab my finger. Good. Now raise your arms. The surgery was very successful, Mr. Choi. Why did you bring me here? I heard you calling Dr. Lee Cho-in by the name of Oh Kang-ho earlier. And you also mentioned Oh Young-ji. What is it you want to know? Everything about Oh Kang-ho, and his relationship to Oh Young-ji. Lee Cho-in tried to kill you during surgery. Shall I call Dr. Lee Cho-in? That jerk... It's his fault I ended up here. What is it you want to know? I'll tell you everything I know. We're reconvening this meeting because Dr. Lee Cho-in objected Dr. Kim Hyun-Ju's demotion and the findings of the committee in our last hearing. Dr. Lee Cho-in. The missing drugs weren't taken by Dr. Kim. I took the drugs with me on my trip to China for my volunteer medical work. Dr. Lee Cho-in, can you prove that in any way? I believe there was someone else who also visited Tolu where I did my volunteer work. He'll be my witness. Who's that? He's Lee Sun-woo, my brother and the director of the Neurosurgery Center, who desperately tried to look for me when I went missing. He told me he'd gone to Tolu to look for me while I was missing. You can be my witness, can't you? Of course. But I'm sorry that I can't confirm you needed antipsychotic meds to help the people there. That's right. The core of this problem is not just missing drugs you took, but the missing antipsychotic meds. Dr. Kim signed a statement admitting she took those. Dr. Kim, you signed this statement, didn't you? That's not my signature. What are you saying? You said you did! Would you please take a look at this? Here's the copy of drug sign-out sheet submitted by Dr. Bang. And this is the copy of a patient consent form signed by Dr. Kim Hyun-ju at the ER. They may look similar, but they're definitely different. What do you mean the signatures are different? It's nearly impossible for Dr. Kim to sign drug release forms every day when the ER is bombarded with emergency patients all day. So sometimes either the head nurse or the doctor on duty signs drug release forms on behalf of Dr. Kim. So... Are you saying that signature is from a nurse? Of course. But someone tried to forge Dr. Kim's signature on the release form to frame her for stealing antipsychotic meds, but he happened to forge a nurse's signature at the end. So the person who should be submitted to a disciplinary action regarding this matter must be the one who forged Dr. Kim's signature to entrap her. I'm submitting this signed copy as evidence, so please punish those who still kept their jobs after being involved in such a shameless act. This is humiliating. I'm sorry. You couldn't even send Kim Hyun-ju away? What will people say? We've ended up being shameless people who'd use a dirty trick to build the Neurosurgery Center, and made Kim Hyun-ju and Lee Cho-in look noble. I'm sorry. I had no idea someone else signed for her. I think you'll be going to Cheong-ju instead of Kim Hyun-ju. Excuse me? Ma'am... Are you going to fire me? Someone has to take the responsibility. You may leave. Ma'am... Things may have gone wrong, but you were the one who told me to do this. We underestimated them. I know. Isn't there a way? You should step down now. You'll get hurt even more if you step up. No. I started all this. Mother, I'll protect you. Don't worry. Welcome back. Now that she's back, the Emergency Medical Center is back on the table, right? Come on. Thanks, Dr. Kim. Go back to work. -Yes. -Yes. Good work. Where's Cho-in? He was just here. Dr. Kim Hyun-ju. Dr. Lee Cho-in. I'm sorry you had to go through that because of me. But I welcome you back. Thanks. That's enough. Get away from her. How are you feeling? How do I feel? What's wrong with me? You mean here? I'm sorry, but I still don't remember anything. Really? Nothing? I'll get my memories back if I need them. You should get new business cards now. BOSUNG HOSPITAL IN CHEONG-JU Watch where you're going! Mr. Oh, it's me. Where are you? I'm on my way to the hospital. Good, we need to talk. You're being sent to Bosung in Cheong-ju? Yes, tomorrow. How can the Vice-Director do this to me? I guess she's starting her move. I'm glad I've invested in your company. If I didn't even have that... Just the thought of it sends chills down my back. Didn't you watch the market today? I was busy with the disciplinary hearing. Was there a problem? Our Medi House stocks plummeted by 15 percent. What? 15 percent... What happened? These flyers were found in Yeoido and Myeongdong. BOSUNG'S NEW NEUROSUGERY CENTER PUT ON HOLD THE OWNER IS LEE CHO-IN, NOT LEE SUN-WOO DR. LEE CHO-IN SUPPORTS THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER You mean our shares will become worthless? They'll lose half their value in two days at this rate. And they'll be worthless in a few more days. Who's doing this? Who else is there but Lee Cho-in? Lee Cho-in, that scumbag... What are we going to do? We can't take this sitting down. I still have an ace up my sleeve. Who are you? Dr. Lee Cho-in. Are you okay, Mr. Oh? Take my hand. Mr. Oh, this hand you're holding now... It can help you get up or push you down. No matter how much I think about it, I don't think you are the only one behind my kidnapping. If you tell me who tried to kill me, who, along with you, gave the gang the okay to kill me, I'll help you up, Mr. Oh. Think about it and let me know. So you're asking me to buy out The Medi House stocks? Yes, at this rate, the Neurosurgery Center may never happen. You know foundations, such as our hospital, can't purchase your private company stocks. But you can buy them personally, no? And if I don't want to do that? Why do you think I came to see you and not your mother? What do you want to say? Vice-Director Nah Hae-ju, your mother, was also involved in Lee Cho-in's kidnapping. She did consent to it, even if it was after the fact. You don't want the world to know that, do you? Lee Cho-in was waiting for me on my way here. He offered to forgive me if I told him who tried to kill him. I see. I'll start buying in two days. I'll take care of Lee Cho-in since I am responsible for the mistake in China. You'd better hurry. He's breathing down my neck... Lee Cho-in. Dr. Lee Sun-woo, it's me, Choe. Where are you? I'm in Seoul. Let's meet. That's what I wanted. Young-ji! Mr. Lee Cho-in. Hurry. Let's hurry. We're late. For what? Mr. Lee, where are we going? Doctor. Yes, Dr. Lee. Her name is Oh Young-ji. Age... -Young-ji, how old are you? -I'm twenty-six. Age twenty-six, and as you can see, she's in top shape. She speaks Chinese and Japanese, and has a killer Chinese-Korean accent. You can interview her now. She's the one you were talking about? -Miss Oh Young-ji? -That's right. Doctor, I'm counting on you. Miss Oh Young-ji, shall we begin the interview now? What interview...? He didn't tell you we're interviewing for the international coordinator position? Sorry? Let's go in. Have a seat. Have you been well? Let's not bring up that car accident since we both made mistakes. Fine. You want to see me again to ask me to take care of Lee Cho-in-- No. There's something else you must do first. I need you to take care of the man who ordered... ...Lee Cho-in's kidnapping. That'll be difficult. He offered me ten times the original amount. I guess you don't watch the news. His company stocks have plummeted. I doubt he'd be able to pay you at all. Take care of it as soon as possible. This isn't enough. You should at least match Mr. Oh's offer. Fine. Okay, then I'll bill you for Lee Cho-in after Mr. Oh has been taken care of. It'll cost you. All right. Let's do that. You're next, Mr. Choe. Young-ji, did the interview go well? How could it go well? You just dragged me there, and I got asked a bunch of questions. I wasn't prepared. That's weird. How did you get the job then? What? I got the job? Yes, you did. You have to start tomorrow. Tomorrow? I can't. I have my restaurant, and I have tour guide jobs booked next week. That's a problem. We have strict policies regarding the refusal of an employment offer, so they'll hold you liable for damages, and ban you from the hospital forever. What am I going to do...? You think I'm a fool? They'd never do that in South Korea. They don't even do that in North Korea. You didn't fall for it. Anyway, you can't go back. Why not? Because I want you next to me. Let's go. I'll take you to your new place. Hello, Dr. Lee. Miss Oh Young-ji. Sun-woo, she got the job at the hospital. Really? That's wonderful. Miss Oh Young-ji, you never budged when I called. I don't know how Cho-in got you here. That's not it... I couldn't come earlier as something urgent came up. Well, this is good news. Let's get along like family from now on. See? You can't go anywhere now. You should just ask him for huge pay. Well, see you around. Why did you do that? You really put me in a spot. I know you're happy. Follow me. You said Oh Young-ji is Oh Kang-chul's sister, the man who saved Oh Kang-ho and died in his place? That's right. Oh Kang-chul and Oh Kang-ho... ...were closer than real brothers. Is that why he wants to keep her next to him and protect her? Lee Cho-in, you gave yourself away by bringing Oh Young-ji here. You're faking amnesia. Who's this? Who's this person you want to get rid of? You saved me so I can do your dirty work, right? Later... I'll tell you later. If possible, let me get rid of that jerk Oh Kang-ho. I'll be snatched away by premature death if I don't tear that scumbag into pieces myself. You live here? Why? Are you disappointed? No... Yes, a bit. I supposed someone like you lived in a nicer place. I stay here because I have to be on call. Are you going to be uncomfortable here? No, that's okay. Just bear with it for a few days. And we can go get your things on my day off. Okay? Okay. What's this? Gum. Stick to me like gum, okay? Mr. Lee. Didn't some strange men pay a visit to you recently? Strange men? Who? At the Cheong-ju Airport, I saw a man who looked like Mr. Choe Bok-geun who tried to kidnap you in China. I was worried he came to see you again... That's why I came to Seoul. Young-ji, we're in Seoul, South Korea. People go to jail for kidnapping. Don't worry. Will you really be okay? I'm the second son of the owner of the Bosung Medical Center. Nothing will happen to me. Don't worry and go to sleep. You'll be okay, right? You're so skeptical. I'm going to sleep. Come down and give me a massage if you're not sleepy. Good night. Young-ji. What I'm most afraid of now is that I may not be able to protect you. That's what scares me the most. Choe Bok-geun. Mr. Oh. Mr. Choe, I've been waiting for you. Let's go up. No, you have to come with us. -It must be hard on your first day. -No. This is the waiting area. Registration is over there. I think there's bleeding in the abdominal cavity. Order an abdomen CT. Do a blood test, too. Yes, Doctor. The Medi House. Mr. Oh In-geun, please. He's not in today. May I take a message? I'll call back. He comes here every single day, but he didn't show up today? I wonder if something's up. SEO-YEON'S ULTRASOUND 12:10PM-01:10PM Did you find a decent place? Yes, the ground is wet, too. Good for digging. -Okay. Let's move him. -Yes, sir. Boss, he's gone! Find him! Young-ji. Young-ji, is that you? Miss Kim Seo-yeon. It is you. What are you doing here? Well, that's... I got a job here. You did? That's wonderful. Thank you. Did you get my text message? I sent you a message when I missed you in Cheong-ju. Yes, I did. Did you have an urgent matter? Well... Kim Seo-yeon. Cho-in. You were here, too. Yes. You have ultrasound today, right? Let's go. Okay. See you around, Young-ji. Yes, bye. Young-ji, did you eat? Of course. Look at the time. I ate. Let's go. Mr. Lee, you two look great together. Oh Young-ji, eat up and come to your senses. We're here. Bye. Good luck. Cho-in, did you see Young-ji in Cheong-ju? Yes. That's why she called... Bye. Seo-yeon. Did you bring a hot pack? Klutz, you forgot that again? You said you didn't like the cold feel of gel. Thanks. Cho-in, you can stop doing things like this now. I feel bad. Let me do this much. Hello? Mr. Oh. Dr. Lee, it's me, Oh In-geun. I'll tell you who tried to kill you. Please get rid of those stock market flyers. You expect me to believe you? I don't want to be a murderer to my wife and kids. I'll leave with my family as soon as I sell my stocks. First tell me who ordered you to kill me. If I give you the name and phone number of the man I hired in China to kill you, will you believe me and take away those flyers? Are you saying that you only hired a killer in China? Of course. The man who tried to kill you is... ...Choe Bok-geun. Boss, I think he took off. We should leave too. If Mr. Oh calls the police-- No. Mr. Oh hired me to kill Lee Cho-in. So he can't go to the police. Yes. Mr. Choe Bok-geun. Who's this? Sir, I asked you who you are. I've known you well from China. Is that right? How do you know me? Mr. Choe Bok-geun. Was it not enough for you to try to kill Lee Cho-in in China? So you even tried to kill Mr. Oh in Korea? Who are you? Come meet me if you want to know. Fine, let's meet. We'll talk when we meet. Where? Sajik Park, in two hours. Fine. Wait. How will I recognize you? You'll recognize me. Fine. GANG WHO TRIED TO KILL ME IN THE DESERT SAME GUY TRIED TO KILL ME IN CHEONG-JU THE PERSON THAT MADE THE ORDER TO KILL ME Boss, are you really going to meet him? I have to meet him and find out who he is. Maybe it's a trap. Maybe the police are onto us. No. Then they'd have traced my number and caught us by now. It's me. What happened to Mr. Oh-- Dr. Lee, where did you leak the information? What are you talking about? Someone knows I tried to kill Lee Cho-in and Mr. Oh. What? Who is that? So you didn't leak the information? Then I'll find out who he is when I meet him. Where are you meeting him? All right. Lee Cho-in. It was you? Choe Bok-geun. You jerk... You lost fear after surviving my shots? I wanted to see your face again... ...even if it killed me. You son of a... Jerk. Get up, jerk. You arrogant son of a bitch. You think you're a changed man since you roamed China with some defectors? But you're no match for us. You didn't think I could use a gun in Korea? We just follow orders. So don't blame us. Choe Bok-geun. Let me ask you something before I die. Did Mr. Oh hire you to kill me? You finally got the truth, but a little too late. When you came to Korea... Who ordered you to kill me in Cheong-ju? Cheong-ju? Damn. He remembers everything. Back then... Mr. Oh didn't know I was alive. Then who ordered you to kill me... ...in Cheong-ju? I have to know even if I die. Mr. Oh did order me to kill you in China. But... ...the man who ordered me to kill you again in Korea... ...was not Mr. Oh... ...but Lee Sun-woo, your brother. Sun-woo. Sun-woo! Sun-woo!
