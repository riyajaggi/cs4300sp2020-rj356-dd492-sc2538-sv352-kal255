 Darn, another worthless day. Did you skip breakfast again? You've got no energy. Here, take this. Come on. His absence in the meeting alone will affect the trustees. Got any connections in China? I've already made arrangements. Have a safe trip. Any discomfort? No, I'm fine. Don't hesitate to let me know. I'm the Head of Neurosurgery. Sure.

 Man, he did such a flawless job. -Park Su-rak! -Yes? Let's look at Ms. Choe's chart. Okay. -Park Su-rak. -Yes? These are the MRIs from Ms. Choe's surgery? -Yes-- -But the date is wrong. Really? PATIENT NAME: CHOE YU-RAH Bosung Hospital in Cheong-ju? Look what we have here... JO HYUN-TAIG RESUME Lee Sun-woo speaking. Dr. Lee, this is Nam Yong-tae. We need you to look at a patient with cerebral aneurysm. -Are you done? -Yes. -We loved your concert. -Thank you. -Picking up Dr. Lee's laundry again? -Yes. Dr. Lee. Dr. Lee. MR. LEE CHO-IN Mr. Lee Cho-in from Seoul! Are you Mr. Lee Cho-in? I'm Lee Cho-in. Who are you? I'm Oh Young-ji, your tour guide. Glad to meet you. Did my brother Sun-woo hire you? Pardon? Yes... I'll take you to your hotel. I'll take your bag. -It's okay. -I insist. I'm your guide. I'll take everything. And I'll keep your passport safe. Come on. Come on! How much to Wenjin Hotel? Five hundred yuan. Do I look like a tourist? -Two hundred yuan. -Fine, get in. It's 500 yuan to the hotel. I talked down the fare because it's slow time now. Get in. Open the trunk. Two hundred yuan. Ah, I see. Well, how cute. Yes, please take care of it. Lee Cho-in has been intercepted. Just make sure he can't come back till Saturday. You needn't worry. He won't set foot in Korea before the board meeting. It's the anterior cerebral artery. Prep a coiling. Hey, Dr. Lee. What's gotten into him? In shock from his Neurosurgery Center proposal going down. Aren't you off? And the Center proposal is just being postponed. Don't let your guard down. -Mr. Lee, I got your keys. -Please leave a message. Want to go to your room? I'll get it! Let me know if you need anything. I'll take care of it. Thanks, but no thanks. Pardon? Are you hungry? The plane food can't be very good. Room service, maybe? Or a stroll to the night market? No thank you. Maybe a massage? A massage. A massage? Yes, from your head to your toes. Go for it. What? I said I'll take that massage. I wouldn't be the one... I'd call for another girl. I want one from you, but you don't have to give me one. Well... good night then. You have to watch him 24 hours a day. If you leave him alone, you won't get paid. Okay, I'll do it. But only a massage. My body is off limits to you. -But your heart isn't? -What? But unfortunately, I'm taken. So I don't want your heart either. -See you tomorrow. -No! Mr. Lee! Knucklehead! You're only a hustler. Who said you can have my heart? My heart and body are both off limits to you! Damn hustler! What took you so long? No, you got the wrong girl! I'm a guide, got it? Hey, wait! Freak! I'm treating you to celebrate your first concert, and you're only eating dessert. I couldn't eat sweets for a week because of the ultrasound. Chocolate éclair, chocolate mousse cake... And what's this? Dark chocolate mousse. You're going to eat all this? The chocolate mousse is so good. Did you see Sun-woo? What? No. Wait, did I? I can't remember. I might not even have recognized him. Cho-in just texted me. It's 44,600 yuan, right? What happened? Found some money? Yes. I hit the jackpot! Give me the passport. Here. This makes my brother a citizen of Joseon. I mean South Korea, right? You got your parents’ and your brother’s passports. You need one now. You're amazing, Oh Young-ji. I still have a long way to go. "Close your eyes and somebody'll slice off your nose," as the saying goes. I have to save up before going to Korea. I'll get you one, too, so keep saving. -Bye. -Wait, sir... how much money can you get for a Korean passport? You found a Korean passport? No. For you, I'll throw in a bit extra. Can you drop me off at the hotel? At the hotel at this hour? It's nothing like that! I have to watch this hustler from Korea. Give me a minute. PASSPORT REPUBLIC OF KOREA PASSPORT LEE, CHO-IN Mr. Lee Cho-in, you hustler... you're my family's way out. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Did you decide on where we'll kidnap Lee Cho-in? Yes. When he's heading for the Reception Party after watching the surgery. Right here. You loser. We kidnapped the other silk exporter at the same spot! We should avoid the same spots. Kidnap him right here! -Yes, boss! -Good. Hello. Yes, boss. -How's Lee Cho-in? -Don't worry, sir. I'm watching him around the clock. Any change in schedule? No, and I have him right here. Okay. Call me if anything happens. You should leave him alone. -Got that? -Yes, sir. Goodbye. Why, that knucklehead. I won't lose you. Hey, wait... Wait. Where did you learn  to leave someone behind? You just seemed so tired. I'm not tired at all. Scoot over, please? How much for the fare? Two hundred yuan! Five hundred yuan. Don't worry, that's all I know. Come on, let's go. Hurry! Thank you. What do you mean you can go by yourself? You can't even speak Chinese. You'll need me to interpret. I won't need an interpreter. Why, you don't trust my Chinese? I'll interpret everything for you. I may not look like it, but I speak fluent Chinese and Japanese. Look! Nice to meet you. It's so nice to meet you. It's such a pleasure. Why, that knucklehead. Come on, sucker. Mr. Lee! Let's get ready. My English could use some work, though. So what, they want to meet with the patient? The interview had already begun when I was informed by a nurse. -Where's the reporter? -In the patient's room-- Who let the reporter in without my permission? Why did I put you in charge? I'm sorry. -Lee Jung-min. -Hello, Dr. Lee. Ms. Choe has lost her sense of taste since the surgery. We need your explanation. As you know, the surgery was for both the aneurysm and the tumor. It was over the area responsible for taste and tongue muscle. There was only one choice. In order to save the patient's life, it was an inevitable choice? There are more important things in life rather than a bowl of soup or chocolate. It's foolish to even question that choice. Except that some people would choose their sense of taste. Did you even know that Choe Yu-rah was a chef? And what did she tell you? That she'd give up her life for her sense of taste? You've changed, Sun-woo. It's as if a romanticist turned into a cold realist. Emotions have no role in saving lives. Are we done? But that's not the real problem. This is Choe Yu-rah's medical record. She was diagnosed with a tumor at a Bosung affiliate hospital six months ago. And she got a CT and an MRI a week ago. DIAGNOSIS CHOE YU-RAH Quite a coincidence for you to run into such a patient. BOSUNG MEDICAL CENTER IN CHEONG-JU On the plane no less. And she had been diagnosed at an affiliate. You were played. It was a rigged situation. I guess you really didn't know. You better take care of it. It could be easily seen as an unethical ploy. I'll look into it and get back to you. One more thing. Did you see Seo-yeon? She really went through a tough period after you disappeared. Mr. Lee! We're going into the surgery room now. Big deal. I'm going there, too. Young-ji, let me tell you about brain surgery. First of all, you remove the skin, and the skull gets exposed. Then you drill through the skull, and cut out a part of the skull. And you open it up. Then you suck out the tumor with a type of vacuum cleaner. But... if you hit an artery, you'll see a fountain of blood. Take good care of my bag. What a knucklehead. Hey! What's the big deal about a surgery? I'm going in, too. Hey, no women allowed in here! This is the men's locker room. Oops. I'm sorry. Sorry! What are you doing? Sorry! This is the men's locker room! Man, what the heck?! So this reporter went to med school together with you? Did you set this up by putting Ms. Choe on my plane? Did you hope for a seizure so I could do the surgery? That wasn't enough, so you notified the press? I had to do it for the sake of my Neurosurgery Center. -What's the matter? -It concerns a life. An emergency life or death situation! They're the ones who accepted the proposition. Ms. Choe's party begged  to have you perform her surgery. I just gave her that opportunity. You didn't have to resort to this kind of set-up, Mom. No. Building the Neurosurgery Center isn't going to be easy. No. No need to worry. You don't have to worry about my qualifications as a doctor. I can certainly win it fair and square. What's this? A list of people who have to go before the center gets built. You can find the name of the whistle-blower in there, too. JO HYUN-TAIG RESUME Things need to be done in a proper order. He can't go yet. The reporter just left? -Are you sure? -Yes, doctor. How much did these rotten scoundrels pay in bribes? And where is this jerk? The reporter was a woman. Why, you... You've been working so hard, Dr. Jo. Working hard? No, not at all. Since our director collapsed from aneurysm, you had to take over the Department of Neurosurgery. You were in the lab till late last night. I'm not yet old enough to complain about the workload. Right. When the Neurosurgery Center opens we hope to have someone like you to lead it. Sun-woo might be a good surgeon, but his reputation pales in comparison to yours. For that to happen, we have to get the votes to build the Neurosurgery Center. Thank you for the kind words, -but I-- -I heard that the ethics committee is making its decision regarding your request for the anticonvulsant experiment. The Head of Committee will call you. Let me congratulate you in advance. You should have dinner with the Dean of the Medical School. I'll arrange it after I hear from the ethics committee. Dean Choe goes along with everything I say. I'm well aware of that. So you're aware that I really have two votes. I'll expect good news. So you're offering me the head position at the center? Give me a break. But I'm going to have my cake and eat it, too. Dean Choe? It's me. So that guy is really a doctor? Darn, I'm constipated again. What kind of surgery takes six hours? What the...? That's what I figured. Boss, this is Oh Young-ji. This Lee Cho-in is carrying so many drugs in his bag. He's no ordinary con artist. He's posing as a doctor and dealing in drugs. Yes, boss. Don't worry. Goodbye. Is the surgery over? Hey, Sun-woo, it's me. How was the surgery? That Jeffrey can work the blade. He removed the tumor completely. Of course. That's the best method of removing chordoma. I've scheduled Dad's surgery for next Monday. We still haven't seen the patient's recovery. Your confidence is off-putting. As long as Jeffrey didn't screw up, the surgery went well. I guarantee it. Okay, I'll call you tomorrow. Sure. Did the surgery go well? Then onto the next scheduled event. Next up... Fujian Province. What...? Fujian Province? Kim Suk-joon and Jung Soon-yi... they've yet to even attend a board meeting. So we'll assume they will be absent. We have six supporters. And Jo Hyun-taig is bringing Dean Choe aboard as well. So of the 14 trustees, we have an overwhelming eight to four advantage. Congratulations, ma'am. The Neurosurgery Center project will become official in three days. Not yet. The Dean has kept his cards hidden so it's seven to five. We've lured Jo Hyun-taig by greasing his palm, but he may turn on us any minute. Make sure to keep things under control. The Ethics Committee has approved your anticonvulsant experiment. Let's find some volunteers. Let's hope for the best results. We're counting on you. Hey... -What's gotten into you? -Anticonvulsant experiment? Is that your bribe for voting for the Neurosurgery Center? Give me some credit, Hyun-ju. I'm Jo Hyun-taig, your mentor! I already heard from the College Dean. You asked him for his vote? Hey, give me a break. Have you forgotten that he and I were classmates? Have you lost your mind? Yes, he has. Otherwise, how would our big brownnoser even think of betraying Director Lee, the man who made him? Why, you guys... You ingrate. Hey, Kim Hyun-ju, I haven't yet made my decision. And this is my own decision, as one of the trustees. You got that? They bought him off. For sure. But this is what I don't understand. An Emergency Medical Center is the director's lifelong dream. So how come his wife is so opposed to it? He wanted his non-biological son, Dr. Cho-in, to head the Center. It was meant to go downhill. What do you mean? Not his biological son? So Cho-in and Sun-woo are not blood brothers? No. What? Cho-in was the son of the Director's friends. When they died in a car crash, the Director adopted him. So the Director wants to give the hospital to an adopted son. If I were the vice-director, I'd fight that, too. Good job! -One more time! -One more time? -Yes! -Please! One, two, three. You always wanted to be a music teacher. So are your dreams fulfilled? Yes, thanks to you. You taught me to play my first instrument. So you've fulfilled your wish of becoming a great doctor. Congratulations. Great? It's just a start. Spoken like Lee Sun-woo. Well, I hope you realize everything you wanted. So I won't feel too insulted about being dumped. I never left you. I did hurt you. But I never left you, not even for a moment. Is everything okay? Okay? Is what okay? My biological heart or my emotional one? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hurt or upset. I'd hate you but then I'd miss you. Then I'd say you must have a reason. And I'd worry. Maybe it's human nature to feel empty after hating someone as much as you loved them. Like a feather. Yes, I can imagine. I'm sorry for the past. No, thanks to you, I've got closure. Thanks for coming. Stay well. I love you, I love you Even when I cry I miss you, I miss you I'm still waiting for you When tomorrow comes And the day after I will be still missing you I will only love you You have a call. Yes, boss. It's me. What the heck? Why didn't you answer?! I'm sorry, I meant to call, but Mr. Lee was making such a fuss. Where are you? On a train. We're headed to Fujian Province. What? Fujian Province? Yes, he changed his itinerary after watching the surgery. He insisted he had to go to Fujian. What could I do? Just stay with him! Yes, he said no, but I insisted. Find out what he's up to, and report to me! Got it? Yes, boss. Did you get in trouble with your job? No. Nothing big. But you can't just change your itinerary. You let me know next time, you "gots" that? Yes, I "gots" that, ma'am. Can I "goes" to the restroom? Well, "makes" it... Please make it quick. What a knucklehead. Lee Cho-in, you folded up your dirty laundry. Blood pressure, 110/74. Heart rate, 88. Respiratory rate, 18. Hemoglobin, 11.8. Red blood cells, 4.1. White blood cells, 4,700. Blood platelets, 18,000. Results of your last vitals and blood tests. Your heart can use some sunflower seeds. They're great for blood circulation. Pistachios. Low in unsaturated fat and rich in vitamin B. Great at preventing heart disease. MY HEART... Why are you going to Fujian? To see my child. Your child? You're married? My heart already feels strong. What would I do without you, Cho-in? I miss you. Me too... The knucklehead sure is busy posing as a doctor... spreading his seed everywhere. I MISS YOU What a womanizer. What was that? Oh, nothing. But seriously, where are we going? Cell phones don't even work out here. We'll soon be able to use a land line. What are we doing out in the middle of nowhere? Man, the battery died, too! Wait... How much longer? We're almost there. You said that an hour ago. Go ahead. Hey. I said, go ahead. But we're here. Stop playing me for a fool. Just go ahead! I'm serious. Knucklehead. Constipation is such a pain. "A revered monk takes a poop on an autumn plain." Hey there, my children! You've been good? Let's go. Please, like I'd fall for such a womanizer? I'd never take such trash. Where is everyone? Where are you, Mr. Lee? How can you play doctor when you can't even communicate? Dear esteemed trustees of Bosung Medical Center. As the chairman of the board and the director of the hospital, I'd like to ask you for a favor. Even if I do not wake up from my chordoma surgery, see to it that the Emergency Medical Center gets built. Our hospital was not established to make money, but to save lives. Even if I shall no longer be around, please rally around Lee Cho-in and Kim Hyun-ju and foster a tradition of saving lives. Sincerely, Lee Jong-min. And when did this will appear? Director Lee had collapsed before the chordoma surgery. I think he left it with Kim Hyun-ju just in case. In Tolu? The cell phone doesn't work? Where's this Tolu? A village in Nanjing County in Fujian Province. -Where in Nanjing County? -Not too sure. Fine, spent the night there. But call me tomorrow! Yes, boss, don't worry. Goodbye. So he thinks he's a big shot here. Have some tea. -Thank you. -You're welcome. So what's between that woman and Mr. Lee? Husband and wife? No. The Chief's father was sick, and Mr. Lee helped him. He's been coming on volunteer missions the last three years. Really? What's that hustler trying to pull? Thank you. I'm fine. I need some medicine, too. What kind? Are you sick? Sit down. No, just give me some medicine. I need to know what your problem is so I can give you medicine or shots. -You saw me earlier. -Saw what? Trying to do, you know... Trying to do what? You saw me constipated! Give me some medicine! Constipation? Did you see that? They didn't know what the heck just hit them. Well, they're on the vice-director's side after all. An unexpected letter from the Director causes quite a stir. How did Jo Hyun-taig react? He got his experiment approved. So he seems content. And the other trustees? You were supposed to have kidnapped him already. Lee Cho-in changed his itinerary. -I apologize. -No excuses! Take care of it now or you won't see another cent! Young-ji. Want a picture, too? No, take more of yourself. What's for tomorrow? I'll see more patients in the morning. Then we'll leave at 10:00 to go see the surgery results. You better stick to that schedule. And think of your girlfriend in Korea. It's been a real eyesore. Heartless knucklehead. He doesn't even ask twice if I want-- Smile! Are you okay? It's nothing. It's something. Let me see. -I said it's nothing. -Stomachache? It happens all the time. Never mind. Where does it hurt? Everywhere! Satisfied? Can't you be serious? It could be your appendix. I once went to the hospital thinking it was the appendix. But it was just constipation. So never mind! -I said, I'm okay. -I say you're not. You're not okay until I say that you are! Got that? Don't you want to be treated? With my clothes on. I told you it's just constipation. Tenderness at the McBurney's point. Suffering from rebound tenderness as well. How long have you felt the pain? It got bad since this morning. I don't hear anything. Is it already a case of intestinal obstruction? What should we do? I think it is your appendix. Then do I have to go to the hospital? She's suffered from acute pains since the morning. It may turn into peritonitis by the time we get there. Get ready to go to the hospital. I'm not going. What? I'm not going to the hospital. Young-ji, we're not going on a picnic. You need surgery. Otherwise, you could even die. Can't you do it here? Oh Young-ji! You're a doctor, right? So do it here. Stop being stubborn and get ready. It's not that I don't want to go. I have my reasons! It's not that I don't think that appendicitis is serious. I want to have surgery and get better, too. Actually, I have to get better. I have to get better... and meet someone. But if I go to the hospital... I might never see this person. So can't you do the surgery here? Please, do the surgery here. I beg you. Keep this up, and I won't see you when you come to Korea. When I go to Korea, will you see me? Will you really? Your father never wanted to give you the hospital! Is this what I get? For having loved and trusted Dad all my life. I see. We go to the desert and we kill Lee Cho-in. Sun-woo. Sun-woo! Seo-yeon!
