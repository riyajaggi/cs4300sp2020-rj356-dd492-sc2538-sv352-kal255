 Are you okay? Thanks to you, the seizure went away. Thank goodness. I'm fine, so go see Oh Young-ji. Are you sure you're okay? Want me to go with you? No, I'll go. Call me if anything's up. Get some rest. This is Lee Sun-woo, have you checked? Dr. Lee. As you just saw, we aren't in the clear either. Your impatience will force us to keep a low profile for a while. So you haven't checked yet?

 Police are investigating the hit-and-run. And you want me to check if Lee Cho-in is dead? If we're found out, you'd be in trouble, too. Okay, I'll find out myself. The customer you're calling is unavailable... Young-ji, is something up? Can you please call me when you get this? Emergency Room. Weren't two car accident victims admitted about four hours ago? How are they doing? Are you a family member? Yes. Miss Oh Young-ji and Mr. Oh Kang-ho had their CT scans and a few lab tests. They're both unconscious as of now. It's not serious? We'll have to see, but it must have been a minor accident. I see, thank you. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE There's always potassium chloride in the ER. When it's directly injected into the veins, it'll cause heart failure within five minutes. Unless a blood test is conducted, the cause of death will be listed as heart failure. Lee Cho-in. Die as Oh Kang-ho, a North Korean defector. OH YOUNG-JI OH KANG-HO MOM -Hi, Mom. -Sun-woo, Cho-in is back. What? He's come back from the dead in one piece. Sun-woo... I'll be right there. Didn't we have a funeral for him? PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS DR. JO HYUN-TAIG DR. KIM HYUN-JU TO BOSUNG IN CHEONG-JU AS OF MARCH 2, 2009 PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT NEUROSURGERY CENTER MARCH 14, 2009 What do you mean Cho-in has appeared? I don't know what's going on either. How can a dead person... Excuse me... By any chance... You wouldn't be Dr. Lee Cho-in? Jin-geun! How have you been? Cho-in... Cho-in, you were alive! I don't hug men! But you were dead, buddy! What happened? It's been 6 months... What happened? Dr. Kim. Isn't today the 14th of November? November 14th, 2008, right? What's that on the bulletin board? What do you mean? You disappeared for six months. Mr. Oh, what's going on? I'm wondering the same thing. Hello, Vice-Director. I just saw him. I'll be right up. She wants to see us. Mr. Choe, finish up the job. It must be wrapped up in Cheong-ju. Something came up at our affiliate in Cheong-ju. I'm sorry, but I'll see you in Seoul. Sun-woo. Now that Cho-in is back, the Neurosurgery Center is done, right? No way. The Director may be a vegetable, but as long as he's alive, Cho-in won't give up on the Emergency Medical Center. This might turn into a war between brothers. Okay, I concede that you've come back alive. But how much do you remember? Lee Cho-in, just how much... Lee Sun-woo! Sun-woo! I missed you. I missed you so much. But... What's happened to me? What do you mean, Lee Cho-in? I just spoke to you while I was in China, and was almost kidnapped. Then I woke up at the hospital in Cheong-ju. What? I don't remember anything. And I got so scared... I just wanted to come here and see you. But people are saying I was gone for six months. What are they talking about? Explain it to me. Lee Cho-in. Do you really... ...not remember anything? Nothing at all? I don't remember. Lee Cho-in. My little brother... I missed you so much. To try to find you... I roamed all over China for two months. I even made flyers. To find any trace of you... You're healthy, aren't you? You're okay? I'm fine. My little brother... Let me take a look at you. You are my little brother Cho-in, aren't you? Don't you worry about anything now. You're here. Big Brother! Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee Cho-in... Miss, are you all right? Mr. Lee... Where's Mr. Lee Cho-in? Why don't I see him? There's no patient by that name. I mean the man who was in the accident with me. Mr. Oh Kang-ho, you mean? Yes, Mr. Oh Kang-ho. Where is he? He's disappeared. Did someone take him? Did a young woman take him? There were no visitors. So where did Mr. Lee Cho-in go? Miss, you need to sit down. Mr. Lee Cho-in... MR. OH KANG-HO Mr. Lee Cho-in... FROM MISS KIM SEO-YEON I CAME TO CHEONG-JU BUT WE MISSED EACH OTHER. Mr. Lee Cho-in! Where have you gone? Mr. Lee Cho-in! Have you eaten yet? Jin-ho. What's wrong? He's disappeared... Who? That Oh Kang-ho knucklehead? Jin-ho. Yes? I'm going to Seoul. What? I have to go see if he's safe. I'm leaving. Young-ji. Are you sure he's Lee Cho-in? Positive, ma'am. How is it that a dead man has come back, Mr. Oh? How is this possible? I'm sorry. I confirmed it with my own eyes. But something must have gone awry. Is that supposed to be an excuse? Anyway, the foundation of Neurosurgery Center has been decided. So Cho-in being alive shouldn't be a problem... Have you forgotten he has the ownership of rights to any additional medical center? You're right. The ownership of rights to any additional center will now go back to Cho-in again. If Cho-in insists on exercising those rights, the Neurosurgery Center will go down. I'll take care of this. What? Going to use the same method again? Everyone at the hospital knows that Cho-in is alive. And you want to kill him? People will be suspicious as it is because we had that funeral. And you want to make more trouble? I want to hear some options. Find some options! Dad. Look who's here. It's Cho-in. The son you love is back. Dad. Dad. Are you okay? Are you okay, Dad? Sun-woo. What's happened to Dad? Has he had surgery? Yes. He has. I told you not to do that while I was in China. That your surgery technique was too risky. So why did you do it? I told you to wait. To look for another way! Then should I have just waited for you? Sun-woo. Even though you were presumed dead for six months? Are you saying Dad should have been on the brink of death before we did anything about it? Come on now. Lee Cho-in. The father you love also happens to be my father. You told me Jeffrey's patient never regained consciousness. At least, our dad regained consciousness. He was unconscious when you were here. So you did your best. It was the best you could do? Yes. It was. Look. Had he remained unconscious, he wouldn't be shedding tears of joy. Dad would have approved of my surgery as well. What's Cho-in doing? He's with dad. Dr. Lee. I mean, Director Lee. We were discussing the future of the Neurosurgery Center. Now that Lee Cho-in has come back from the dead, the ownership that went to my parents go back to him? Yes, and the center may never get built. I'm sorry things had to come to this. All you have to do is file for an injunction. And then to file for a legal motion claiming half of the rights? Yes, so you don't have to worry about that for now. But there's a more urgent matter. What is that? Lee Cho-in is displaying symptoms of amnesia. Amnesia? He says he's lost six months of memory. From when he was kidnapped till when he woke up today. No... Are you saying that he could be faking the amnesia? He was nearly killed in the desert. It's only natural for him to be suspicious. So he's faking amnesia in order to find out who tried to kill him? That's the question. We must find out if the amnesia is real, in order to figure out what he's thinking. You have something in mind? We're running every test there is. We should find out by tomorrow. PATIENT NAME: LEE JONG-MIN PRIMARY DOCTOR LEE SUN-WOO You'll see how accurate my surgery technique is. Go to China. What is it that you want? Money? But I have to go back to Korea. For my dad's surgery! So let me go! Sun-woo! Dad, tell me it's not true. Did you end up this way because they wanted the Neurosurgery Center instead of the Emergency Medical Center? Was I shot in the desert because of that? I can't trust anyone besides you, Dad. Mother. You scoundrel. You disappeared and made us go through your funeral. And you don't even come say hello? I'm sorry. Well, you're back and alive. We'll talk later. And you can't tell me you're glad to see me alive, mother? Do I have to take an EEG, too? I've had nothing but tests all day long. X-rays, cardiogram, blood test, MRIs... Can't you give me a break? You've come back after six months. Aren't you curious? Not at all. Just thankful to be back. Don't just think about yourself. Okay. But this is it, okay? Sure. This is just so serious. Let's do this! Start with what you remember. Yesterday, I was on my back from China to Korea for my father's surgery. Then I was kidnapped. That's when I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was at the hospital in Cheong-ju. So you have no memories of the six months that passed? None whatsoever. Who was the last person you remember seeing in China? I had my last conversation with my tour guide. What was this guide's name? Oh Young-ji. And what are your memories of her? She was nice and cute. Then you were kidnapped and lost your memory? Right. Thank you. Thanks. Man, what a drag. So what is your professional opinion? I believe that it is a case of dissociative amnesia. The X-rays and MRIs show an old fracture. But the amnesia can't be attributed to that. It seems more like dissociative amnesia. From the wounds in his head and fingers, I surmise that he's been through some trauma. And that can often result in dissociative amnesia. I'm Oh Kang-ho. Oh Kang-chul's brother. But he seems disinterested in his past. Is he trying to hide something from the past? Severe trauma can trigger an unconscious defense mechanism. So being disinterested in his past is entirely possible. Thank you, gentlemen. What do you think? I'm not convinced yet. What do you plan to do? There may be a trump card which can tell us the whole truth. You klutz, how have you been? Are you really Cho-in? What are you doing here? In China... ...in the desert... You died... Is this you? Is it really you? It is, you klutz. It is you. It is you, Cho-in. How could this... I came back late. And I know you hate waiting. I'll tell you everything. In China... I lost my memory. I was kidnapped or something... Then I remember nothing. What? I can't believe it myself. Sun-woo... Don't worry. Sun-woo knows that I'm back. So don't worry. Don't worry. I'll call you later. Okay then. When did you get into town? So Cho-in's been diagnosed with dissociative amnesia? That's what the psychiatrists seem to think. Oh? Are you onto something? I had met Cho-in earlier in Cheong-ju. What? He didn't remember that he was Lee Cho-in. And now he has dissociative amnesia? Maybe there was some psychological trauma in the meantime. Cho-in says he was shot in the desert. Shot? Some people tried to kill him in China. And he was afraid to come back without knowing who did it. What in the world... So who tried to kill Cho-in? Someone who'd benefit from his absence. I'm not so sure if he really has dissociative amnesia. What are you implying? That he's pretending to have lost his memory? Well... So what do we do now? Wait till Cho-in finds out more on his own. Kim Jin-geun, look after him. Like I have any clout? You're the only one he can trust here. Mr. Lee Cho-in... Miss Oh Young-ji? Aren't you Oh Young-ji? Cho-in came home safe thanks to you. Thank you. You came to see Cho-in? -Can I see the list of patients? -Here, sir. Is Mr. Kim awake? We did gastro lavage, but his mental state isn't alert yet. Do an EEG and get the Internal Medicine down here. Okay. Cho-in. Young-ji. Mr. Lee... When did you get to Korea? So you really came to see me. How have you been? How's your stomach? Yes... Cho-in. Guess who told us that you might have been kidnapped? Young-ji, of course. Really? How did you know I was kidnapped? Well... Why does it matter as long as you're home safe? Let me buy lunch to celebrate your reunion. Okay. Let's go. Young-ji, eat up. Okay... Young-ji, how's your constipation? Young-ji, where's your home? My home? Well... Sun-woo, this isn't a census. Young-ji, enjoy your meal. Sure. So what do you do in Korea? Mister! I'm doing all right... I work as a guide to Chinese and Japanese tourists. And in the evenings, I run a snack bar. So you have two jobs. Yes... We might have a job for you in the hospital. Pardon? You speak foreign languages. We get many Korean-Chinese patients. We could use someone like you. Not a bad idea. What do you think? I know nothing about hospitals. Give it a try. With Sun-woo's recommendation, you'd get paid a lot. Tell him yes. Time to say goodbye. Yes. Bye, Young-ji. Goodbye. And reconsider the job offer. Bye. Mr. Lee Cho-in, thank goodness you're okay. I apologize for second guessing your brother. I'm glad to see you in such good spirits. Mr. Lee, you look great in a doctor's gown. Mr. Lee, I'm not coming back to Seoul. So forget everything that happened in Cheong-ju. So keep smiling and stay happy. Young-ji, I'm sorry. About having to send you off like this. Mr. Lee Cho-in... Mr. Lee Cho-in... Mr. Lee... It's my turn to be your superman and knight. I'll take you anywhere you want. Will you believe in me and receive treatment? Thank you. For not loving someone else. For loving me. LEE SUN-WOO LEE CHO-IN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES MY HEART MY HEART Cho-in, it's me. I was in such shock earlier, I didn't even get to say much. Thank you. For coming back alive. That's all I can think of saying for now. Bye. I went to go see your remains today. I said my farewell. But I feel as if I didn't get to say everything. Cho-in! If I say your name a million times, can you come back? Just be alive, please. Just be alive as Sun-woo was. Can you go back for now? I'm so confused. Seo-yeon, it's not something you can avoid. When did you find out? That he came back? When you left me in Cheong-ju yesterday? Yes. So why didn't you tell me? I didn't want you to be disappointed just in case it wasn't him. I'm sorry I wasn't honest. Was that the real reason? Then why did you just go back earlier? I didn't want you to feel pressured. Cho-in was there for you during the seven years I hurt you. I felt he deserved you. So you're just going to back down? I have no choice. And how long will you wait again? With my favorite Dutch coffee and music records? And what if you get really sick and die? Are you stupid or something? Why can't you just ask me to stay? You need me! Yet you act with such little confidence! This is why I didn't tell you. Just for being sick... I didn't want your pity as a man on borrowed time. I didn't want to hold you back, so I didn't tell you. And what's so terrible about that? You can hold onto me that way. Yes, I, too... I feel like getting on my knees and begging you to stay. But... I... I can't do that to you, Seo-yeon. What? You were always sick. Your mother passed away. Your father remarried and went to Germany. You were left all alone in this world. And for me to leave you behind, too... I'd feel so terrible. Lee Sun-woo, don't go! Don't go. Not because you need me... But because I need you. Cho-in helped me endure the past seven years. But you're the one who helped me live. So don't go. Let's stay together. Whether it be two or twenty years... Let's stay together. Don't say anything else... Just tell me that you love me. That you want to stay together. I love you. Kim Seo-yeon. I love you...
