 Live a happy life. And until I can bring Mom and Dad... Even if everyone points their fingers at me... I won't let go of that man. He was a gift from you... I'll hold onto him. I'll let you go now. Farewell. Bye... I'll be back again. I'm done. Hello... Bye... Lee Cho-in...

 Let's go. Come on. Get in. Come on. Young-ji. Just get in! Let's go. What brings you this way, Dr. Jo? You can turn in your resignation at the personnel office. I want you to see this before I resign. What is it? MRI results of a patient with an astrocytoma. LEE SUN-WOO Do you see the patient's name? Is that the Lee Sun-woo from the Johns Hopkins? Or not? If the word gets out that someone with an astrocytoma is running the Neurosurgery Center, will the center be affected? Or not? Are you okay? It's nothing... How are you today, Miss Kim? What about Sun-woo? He should be here soon. I contacted him. These American hospitals. If he doesn't come, we'll go find him. Right? Kim Seo-yeon, who am I? I'm Lee Cho-in after all. Have I ever broken a promise? When you were comatose after the transplant, he held your hand and prayed. Is Sun-woo still not here? LEE SUN-WOO Sir, I think your mother has found out about your recurrence of illness. She went to go see your father. You gave your disease to Sun-woo? Not my Sun-woo! Lee Jong-min. Take your disease and Sun-woo's with you! Mom. Take them with you alone... Sun-woo... He doesn't deserve your kindness! Sun-woo. Let's go. Let's go to the Johns Hopkins. We'll get the best staff to operate on you. And you'll come back good as new. No. I'm not going. Sun-woo. Mom, the team I have put together here is the best. Maybe not yet, but I'll make them the best. And I'll cure myself. So you need not worry. My son... My precious son... After what you went through these past seven years... I didn't want you to cry in faraway America... I just wanted you to inherit a great hospital... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my son. I came too late for your rescue. You'll get better, my baby. Just as you did last time, right? Don't worry, Mom. I'll get better. You do that. I'll look after your father, so just look after yourself. I'll do whatever it takes to protect you. Okay? Yes. I believe you, Mom. You can go in. Goodbye. Can you stop the car? Please. Thank you, you can go. Sir! Mr. Oh Kang-ho! Mr. Oh Kang-ho... REQUEST FOR LONG-TERM LEAVE We got a copy of the ID. Just bring in the seal and the paperwork by tomorrow. So we can leave now? Yes. We don't let anyone leave without all the paperwork. But we have faith in you as a new citizen. Thank you. Is it true that the tumor recurred? Why did you keep me in the dark, too? Sir. Stop making a fuss. What grade? It's an astrocytoma, so does it even matter? What do you mean? You're giving up? No. I exchanged my loved ones for this Neurosurgery Center. I haven't even started yet. Let's go to Johns Hopkins. I'll do the surgery. I'm the Director of this brand new Neurosurgery Center. And I go to America with a brain tumor. Think that the center can keep going? Sir. Don't worry. I have too much going on to go away now. The linear accelerator will be here next week. Just wait till then. Seok-hoon. How did my mother find out? I think Dr. Jo told her. Jo Hyun-taig... Yes. I see. You can go. Jo Hyun-taig... So he blackmailed my poor mother again... Hello? I'm calling you about the list of defectors. Go on. The defectors are all at the orientation center. Did you get the photos? It's impossible to get them. You'll have to wait for two months till the orientation is over. I hired you for a reason. Do whatever it takes to get some photos. Do you understand? Yes, I do. Please don't be alive, Lee Cho-in. Don't make me kill you twice. Waiting for me? You stayed out late. Did you have something to say? No, I just wanted to see you. Bye. Why... Why didn't you tell me then? Why didn't you tell me you came for my surgery? If you had told me... It wouldn't have been so hard. Even if I had told you, nothing would've changed. I couldn't ask you to wait... I was in a battle with no end in sight. Sun-woo. But deep inside my heart... I had faith that you'd wait for me. You were the only one for me. And I believed that I was the only one for you. I'll wait for you. Just a minute. Come in. Sit down. You must be hungry. I'm okay. You can't be. I haven't eaten for a few days... And I'm just skin and bones. Give me a minute. I'll make dinner. RAMEN: CURLY NOODLES BISCUIT: CRUNCHY SNACK TV CHANNEL: TV ROUTE CD PLAYER: LASER AUDIO I hope you like it. It's potato dumpling soup. It's a famous North Korean dish. Go ahead. Thank you. Aren't you eating? What? Oh, I am. You know something? When I was a little kid, my mom would make this. I'd want to eat first. But she'd insist on waiting for the whole family. When I was starving like I am now, Kang-chul would always come home. I'd hate and love him at the same time. We'd have the dumpling soup, and stay up all night talking about our day. When I think about it... Those were the happiest days of my life. How do you make potato dumpling soup? Why? Want to make it yourself? Yes. Never mind. My mom used to say, a man should never be in the kitchen unless he's castrated... Thank you for this meal. But deep inside my heart... I had faith that you'd wait for me. You were the only one for me. And I believed that I was the only one for you. I'll wait for you. Miss Oh. How did you live in China? I worked as a tour guide. Mr. Lee Cho-in from Seoul! I'm Lee Cho-in. I'd show Korean tourists around and interpret for them. I'd help them do what they wanted to do. And I'd take them where they wanted to go. Smile, one, two... How did it turn out? Don't be so shocked. You don't want a picture of us? Mr. Oh. Do you really not remember anything? I want to thank you. For what? For calling me Oh Kang-ho. Who are you? You're really not Lee Cho-in? What's this? This must be about me. PERSONNEL CHANGE JO HYUN-TAIG HAS BEEN SUMMONED TO THE ETHICS COMMITTEE FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT Ma'am, what are you trying to pull? Have you forgotten what I know about Sun-woo? Dr. Lee... Dr. Jo, all you could come up with was blackmail? Why, is that wrong? Unjust enrichment from the anticonvulsant experiment.... And three years of data manipulation on an anticoagulant experiment... Quite a few things here. And what about it? Why don't you take care of this before blackmailing people? What? Lee Sun-woo. If I so much as open my mouth about your illness... The Neurosurgery Center will go down in flames. Revealing personal medical history is a crime. It can result in a three year sentence and a $10,000 fine. And your medical license would be revoked as well. So you'll turn me in? Are you trying to test me? Mr. Jo Hyun-taig. I can make your life a living hell. Understand? I have to drop some paperwork off at the orientation center. Have some breakfast. CITIZEN'S ID OH YOUNG-JI You're all set, Miss Oh. Thank you. This is an orientation checklist. Make sure Mr. Oh gets the medical check-up, at least. Okay? Yes, thank you. Mr. Oh, did you eat? It took me a while. Mr. Oh Kang-ho! Mr. Oh Kang-ho! Mr. Oh Kang-ho! SO-MANG HOSPITAL Mr. Oh... I sent you the photos, take a look. Oh Young-ji... So how much more do you want? Ten times the initial amount. You're rather greedy. Please leave. Then where will I get that money? I hear Lee Cho-in was the son of Bosung's Director. Maybe I should go there. If you thought such blackmail would work, you were gravely mistaken. Get lost! Young-ji. Where did you go? Shouldn't you tell me these things? Can't you leave a note? You're an amnesiac. What if you get lost or something happens to you? I darn near died looking for you. I'm sorry. Sorry, Young-ji. Don't do this again. Got that? Yes, ma'am. Okay, then. Aren't you hungry? I am. Very much so. Let's go home, I'll make you dinner. Wipe that smile off your face. To think of what I went through! And where did you go anyway? When tomorrow comes and the day after I will be still missing you. I will only love you. Lee Cho-in. I love you. I love you, dear. I miss you, I miss you. I'm still waiting for you. When tomorrow comes and the day after I will be still missing you. I will only love you. Good job, take a break. She must have really loved this guy. I'm overwhelmed just listening to her. Well, it's like a farewell gift to reach closure. Right, Sun-woo? A farewell gift... Why don't we go for a beer? Sure, Seo-yeon, too... No, just us. Okay. Bye, Sun-woo. Oh, hi... You miss him so much that you had to write a song? Sun-woo. Will you live the rest of your life holding onto his ghost? What's wrong with you? It's a farewell to Cho-in... Cho-in, Cho-in, Cho-in! How long will you go on? Aren't you the one holding onto him? Whenever you see me, you're reminded of him. I don't have any regrets about Cho-in like you might. But he's the man I loved. And he's the man who loved me the most. So it just takes some time to let him go. You know something? If I still mean the world to you... Before worrying about Cho-in... You should've asked me how I felt about you. I just don't know... ...the Lee Sun-woo standing before me... I really don't know. Seven years ago and now... I'm the same person. But you've changed. You've had a change of heart. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE Who is it? Choi Chi-soo. Choi Chi-soo...? Just had to show that he was in Security Forces. He slit his own carotid artery with his own nails. Vicious punk. We better repatriate him. Not repatriate, but deport. 201-101 HYUNDAI APARTMENT OH YOUNG-JI Young-ji. I won't ever leave you all alone. I'll keep my promise to Kang-chul. Thank you. You have a check-up at the orientation center. Go wash up really good. Here's your change of clothes. Go on. Mr. Oh. A monkey would take you for his buddy. Shave that thing off your chin. Got it? PUBLIC BATH Comrade Oh. This scar... Have I always had it? Was it there when you saved me? Mr. Lee Cho-in... Did I keep you waiting? Here... You can't lose it. 201-101 HYUNDAI APPATMENT DEUNGCHON, CHEONG-SEOK MEDICAL CHECK-UP FOR IMMIGRANTS Looks like it already started. You better go. Mr. Oh. I'll be back by the time you finish. Don't go anywhere and wait here. Oh Young-ji speaking. Yes. Who's this? This is Cho-in's brother Lee Sun-woo. Oh, hello... One second. Where are you? Where...? I'm working. I see. I'd like to meet. Shall I go see you? No. I'll go see you. You can come to the hospital. Okay. Man-ho. I see money. Boss. Blackmail might tip them off that we killed Lee Cho-in. You punk. Do I look that stupid to you? Stay still. PATIENT NAME: OH KANG-HO Doctor. Can you take a look at my post-op wound? Sorry? This wound. Is there anything you can tell me? Where I got the surgery and what it was for. Well, I can't tell you for sure. But the big scar tells me it's from your childhood. This looks like a heart surgery wound. And this looks like a lung ailment. This wouldn't have been possible in North Korea. And in South Korea? It looks like the scar is over 20 years old. At that time, you could count the number of hospitals that could do this with your hand. Which hospitals? Well, you could call the hospital association. Thank you. KOREAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION Looking for your lost memory, Comrade Oh? Choi Chi-soo... Thought I couldn't get out? Thought I'd let them deport me? I've been waiting for you. I'll kill you to avenge Kang-chul. You know what went through my mind? I was going to report everything, get us both deported and tear you to death. Or I was going to stay here and crush you. That's what I was thinking, you knucklehead dirt bag. But I changed my mind. You met Oh Kang-chul's sister? Stop struggling. You know what this does better than I do. Kang-ho. And Oh Young-ji made this just for your sake. Oh Kang-ho. You made me blow the money that would have brought my family. So you should lose someone you cherish, too. Then you'll know what it feels like. Come in. Sir, you have guests. Show them in. Hello, Dr. Lee. Who are you? My name is Choe, and I have an import-export business in China. Choe... I happen to know the details of what happened to Lee Cho-in. Shall we talk here or somewhere more quiet? I happen to know how he faced his final moment. Could you speed up?
