 Dad... you raised me... in an incubator, when I was born three months prematurely. You gave me bone and flesh... but... ...my heart is gone. Seo-yeon was like a heart to me. I've lost my heart. After what happened to you and to the hospital... how am I going to go on without a heart? THE LATE MR. LEE CHO-IN

 Lee Cho-in... You really don't remember anything? Nothing? You really want to get your memories back? Why do you want to get them back when they'll only hurt you? THE LATE MR. OH KANG-CHUL I've gotten my memories and the one I love back. But maybe I was happier when I didn't have my memories. Anyway... I'm about to embark on a very lonely fight. Please get out of the way. Patient on his way. Excuse me. Out of the way. Good morning, Mr. Director. Dad, where to now? The Pediatrics? Cardiology? Obstetrics or Gynecology? If you don't answer, I'll go wherever I want to go. Okay. Let's go. We'll now begin the regular conference of the Neurosurgery Center. We'll first present a report on deep brain simulation surgery. First case. Female, aged 74, her chief complaint was uncontrolled Parkinson's disease. Lee Cho-in, what did that smile mean? KIDNAPPING CHINA BOSUNG HOSPITAL JEFFERY SHANGHAI AIRPORT OH YOUNG-JI OH YOUNG-JI DESERT OH KANG-CHUL AND COMPANY FLYER JUNGLE BACK TO KOREA PRISON CAMP If some people really did try to murder you, the fact that you're alive must be shocking to them. They even had an urn with your name on it. Hello. Hello. BOARD OF TRUSTEES SECRETARIAT BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING FOUNDATION PLAN OF NEUROSURGERY CENTER THE MINUTES BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING BALLOT COUNTING RESULT NEUROSURGERY 5 EMERGENCY MEDICAL 5 LEE CHO-IN OH KANG-HO NEUROSURGERY CENTER APPROVED 1/16/2009 ORGANIZATION CHART DIRECTOR OF NEURO CENTER DR. LEE SUN-WOO HEAD OF RESEARCH INSTITUTE OH IN-GEUN & BANG TAE-MAN Mr. Choe, what are you doing? You asked for my money when you didn't even kill Lee Cho-in? Let's not rehash the past. We're exhausted, too. Look! You've put me in a very awkward situation. I'm about to lose my research institute at the Bosung Hospital. Hello? Those scumbags... What? Dr. Lee... You're done with your call? Yes. I heard you had come back, but I was too busy to give you a call. Nice to see you again. Have a seat. You're well, I presume? I'm not sure, but I have a wound on my head, and I have a burned scar on my side, as if I'd been shot. Oh no... By the way, what brings you to my office? I have a gift for you. Do you want to see it? What? You don't like it? This is the urn you sent my ashes in. So what's that look on your face? Mr. Oh, did you... ...really identify my body? No... No, I didn't. You did not...? But isn't it strange? Why did they send... ...an unidentified body to you, and not to the family? So I had this idea. The people who sent this urn to you... ...are the kidnappers. No, it's not me. It's really not me. Why do you think they did that? Mr. New Rich? After the foundation of the Neurosurgery Center was announced, the stocks jumped 1000% and made you very rich. You should carry a handkerchief. Mr. Oh, you should send the ashes back to its rightful owner, but keep the urn. I think you'll have a use for it very soon. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL It's Mr. Oh. Should I hang up? Give it to me. Oh In-geun? Do you take me for a fool? You want to be buried alive? How dare you threaten me? I'll give you ten times. What did you just say? I'll give you ten times the amount you asked for. Where shall we meet, Mr. Oh? Fine. Boss. I'll call you right back. So if I sign this paper, the ethics committee will reopen the disciplinary hearing, right? Yes, that's right... APPLICATION FOR REVOKING DISCIPLINARY ACTION SIGNATORY: LEE CHO-IN I think I will see you at the ethics committee again. You know I have no bad feelings toward you, right? Of course. You made me feel a lot better. Then I'll see you at the ethics committee. DR. BANG TAE-MAN Dr. Bang, it's me, Oh. Don't hang up. Listen to me carefully. Do you know what Lee Cho-in just brought me? Mr. Oh... I got one, too. What? Lee Cho-in was at your office, too? I was the one who reported Dr. Kim Hyun-ju's illegal drug dealings. It just backfired on me. What is it? Lee Cho-in has been to see Mr. Oh and Dr. Bang. What do you mean? He gave the urn to Mr. Oh, telling him to give it back to the people who produced the corpse. And he made Dr. Bang rescind the disciplinary action against Dr. Kim Hyun-ju. Wasn't she found guilty of selling antipsychotic meds? Was that a set-up? I'm sorry. Mr. Oh and Dr. Bang, can't you do anything right? Mr. Director-- Stop it at all costs. Do you understand what the consequences of Dr. Kim's reinstatement will be? It could give the Emergency Medical Center supporters, another chance to push for their cause. Yes, sir. I'll do my best to stop it. Mr. Oh. Yes, Mr. Director. You'll be responsible for producing Cho-in's non-existent body. Excuse me? Take care of it on your own. If you don't, we might have a new Chief of Research. Was that it, Lee Cho-in? Was that the reason for that smile? Surprised? What are you doing? Stop it! Are you angry? Don't kid around about it. I met with Mr. Oh. -Mr. Oh? -Yes. I heard he brought my urn. Yes, he did. What did you talk to him about? -Lee Cho-in. -You think it was Oh In-geun? What do you mean? The jerk who kidnapped me and kept me out of the country for six months. Cho-in, don't you remember what you said during the tests? It's good enough you have returned. There's no point in-- No. I've changed my mind. What? I've been thinking all night. I just feel so wronged. They kidnapped me and kept me out of Dad's surgery. I must find out who they are. Cho-in, I'm telling you again. Nothing good will come out of making an issue of it. It's in the past. Sun-woo, you, of all people, shouldn't say that to me. Your brother came back from death's door after six months. And he doesn't even remember what happened to him. Shouldn't you go out there and find the one who did it? Lee Cho-in. You are just like them. What? When you received my ashes... Not even a body... You should've at least done the DNA testing! Or... You should've found out who sent the ashes. If you didn't even do that, you're no different from those who tried to kill me. Did you want me to disappear, too? What are you saying? Why would you think I'd wish you dead? I heard your body was found in the desert, decomposed beyond recognition. And your ring came back with the ashes. There was no room for doubt. And that was when I was in China looking for you. So... How could you say this to me? I'm sorry. I must have been out of my mind. Even I sometimes think something's wrong with me. I don't remember anything. Sometimes I think I should be grateful I'm back home, but sometimes... I desperately want to find the men who tried to kill me, and blow their brains out. I'm sorry, Sun-woo. But you understand me, don't you? Yes. It's just post-traumatic syndrome. Thanks. I'll be going then. And if... I mean if... ...something like this happens again... ...use a better picture of me. That's a stupid picture. Don't you think? What's your intention behind your actions? Is it really a case of dissociative amnesia? Or are you putting on a really good act? Dr. Lee Sun-woo. Where are you? I guess Lee Cho-in is still alive. Let's meet. Get back to me as soon as possible. Man-ho, this is getting more interesting. We'll have to kill Lee Cho-in anyway. Maybe we should go with Mr. Oh who offered more money. No. We'll meet Lee Sun-woo and hear his terms first. This Lee Cho-in is our retirement package. Let's go, sir. You'll be gone as soon as Lee Cho-in dies, Choe Bok-guen, you idiot. I was at the ER, but they told me I'd find you here. Do you want to talk? You hated me last night, didn't you? Can I be honest? Yes, please. I'm not sure. Seo-yeon... I'm still confused and can't sort things out. So... Can't you please give me some time? Cho-in-- Don't sort out your feelings just yet. I just came back, so let's take some time... Cho-in. You can be mad at me because I couldn't even wait six months for you. But actually you came back a month ago. No, it wasn't you that came back, but it was your ashes, and the ring. The ring that you and I shared... I'm sorry I couldn't wait for you. I'm really sorry. No. I understand. Because it's you, Kim Seo-yeon. I understand. It must have hurt just as much as when Sun-woo disappeared. No, maybe even more. It must have broken your heart. Lee Cho-in, you're always like this. You don't give me a chance to be remorseful. You're hurting more than me. I know you're hurting more but you're only worried about me. I know how much you love me. I do, but... I can't leave Sun-woo now. I love Sun-woo. I'm sorry, Cho-in. I'm sorry. No. It's okay, Seo-yeon. So don't cry. It's okay. I'm okay, so don't cry. It's okay as long as it's your decision. It's okay. Don't cry, Seo-yeon. If you cry like that... ...your heart will get sick. Thank you. See you next time! Good bye. Thank you! INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL Good bye! Get on. Here we go. Oh Young-ji speaking. Miss Oh Young-ji, this is Lee Sun-woo. Hello, Dr. Lee. I offered you a job at the hospital last time we met with Cho-in. Yes. It just so happens that we have an opening for you. Can you come in for an interview tomorrow? Thank you for the offer, but-- Young-ji. Cho-in is having a very difficult time, because of his lost memories, and he's having some personal problems. What problems? You'll find out when you come. I'll be waiting. See you tomorrow. Hello? Dr. Lee! MR. LEE CHO-IN Mr. Lee Cho-in, Mr. Choe's not trying to hurt you again, is he? He wouldn't be able to hurt you now that you have your family beside you. But I'm getting really anxious. What am I going to do? But this doesn't mean you're not going to see me anymore, right? No. How can I go on without seeing you? Good. That's good enough. Go. Okay. Bye. Really? The ethics committee will reopen my case? What's wrong with you? Have you been lied to all your life? I'm serious. Yes, 100 percent real. I should thank Cho-in. I doubt he had time to take care of my business. Not only that. The entire hospital has been turned upside down because of what he did today. Really? Yes, so everyone's saying you'll be reinstated and the Emergency Medical Center will be revitalized, and that Lee Sun-woo must be getting really nervous now. I can't even work with all that's going on. I see. Shouldn't we get ready soon, too? Yes, we should. I'm happy that the Emergency Medical Center might get another chance, and the thought of seeing you again is making my heart skip a beat. Do you really want to say that now, you idiot? It's only natural that we miss each other, it's a beautiful thing, but you calling me an idiot... -Jin-geun. -Yes? I think Cho-in is rushing things a bit. Make sure to keep an eye on him. Yes, ma'am. I'll keep my eye on him. Will it be possible to get the Emergency Center back on the table at this point? Doctor, we have the CT results for Ms. Oh Kyung-ja. Okay. DUMPLING HOUSE OPEN EVENINGS Two spicy chicken stews? Okay. Be right there. Why isn't he coming back? Seo Jin-ho, what took you so long? Young-ji, can't you buy me a motor scooter? It's so hard to do deliveries on that bike. Don't say that. Kang-ho made deliveries on that bike without any complaint and he even took me to and from work every day. So stop complaining and deliver this. I'm not complaining. I'm just exhausted. Look at this. There's a kind of sport called body-something in South Korea, and I think I can win a medal if I enter the contest. Seo Jin-ho, I'll dock it from your pay if the food gets cold. By the way, why doesn't your brother come by anymore? I couldn't stand him at first, but I miss him now. Get going! Jin-ho's not the one to complain much... Mr. Lee, you must've been exhausted, too. But you never let on. No. Lee Cho-in. I've been looking everywhere for you. Good job. Great job. What's wrong now? You turned the hospital upside down just this afternoon, and now you're sulking? What is it? Forget it. Let's have a drink. We should celebrate your return. I don't want any. Why not? I even bought your favorite jelly. If I drink... I think I'll go crazy. You can't go crazy. You can't... I'm going to drink, so let me know if you want some. Kim Seo-yeon, is it true that Cho-in has come back alive? Yes. How can this be happening? He's not hurt? Is he okay? He looks fine on the outside. Maybe he's hurt inside. Kim Seo-yeon, are you okay? What do you mean? Are you really okay? Yes, I am. No... I will be okay. Jung-min, do you know what Cho-in means to me? Something really must be wrong. What is it? I doubt it's hospital business. You know something? Go ahead. You know... There's someone who's a lot like me. We were both sick when we were little and... We have... ...countless things... ...in common. Maybe Cho-in and I were from the same body. Cho-in was my man, but I feel as if he was my own flesh and blood. Maybe we grew... so much like each other... ...in every way. Cho-in grew up in an incubator, and I lived in a sterile room because of my heart condition. We felt like... ...fraternal twins, and couldn't let each other go. Like my own flesh and blood... Like twins born of the same blood... Like we were born with the same fate, and I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. So... I wanted to be his family. A family who never has to say bye. But now we no longer do that. She said we couldn't do that anymore. But he said... ...this was the end now. No... Actually, I ended it. You think this is fate, too? You think something like this is fate, too? How's the ethics committee meeting going? It's not easy since it was a set-up. What about you? I'm meeting with the men I hired in China, but I'm more worried about Ms. Nah and Director Lee. -What do you mean? -Didn't you see? They're ready to abandon us as soon as we make a mistake. You're right. I got that feeling, too. But our stocks are safe, right? They're still safe, but they might become useless if Lee Cho-in decides to exercise his ownership rights to the new medical center. Then what do we do? We should sell them now. We can't. We're two of the major stockholders, and we'll draw attention if we sell our stocks in bulk. Then if you could sell my share first... You've already sold some of your stocks. You think I still have that money? I poured that money into a Research Institute. What if we end up penniless and without jobs? We have to do something before it comes to that. We can't let Lee Cho-in and Lee Sun-woo ruin us. What could they be guilty of? They're just puppets. There's someone behind them. DESERT GANGSTERS CHINESE? KOREAN? We just follow orders. So, don't blame us. THE MOST BENEFICIARY OF NEUROSURGERY CENTER Mother and Sun-woo are all that's left. You have decided to transfer to emergency medicine? There's nothing to decide. I do what you tell me to do. -Cho-in. -Yes, Dad. I'll trust you and build the Emergency Medical Center. -Is that okay? -Of course. It was your lifelong dream. Yes, it was. But you and I might have to face strong opposition to realize that dream. See that property there? The new Emergency Medical Center will be built there. Over there? Wow, that's a great location. Yes, our patients will have easy access. And this is the registration that transfers the deed to the land to you. Sign here. Dad, I don't need it. Give it to Sun-woo. Cho-in. Dad, I'm more than grateful that you saved my life and raised me up till now. I don't want a piece of paper to drive Sun-woo and me apart. So give it to Sun-woo. You have to take it if you want to realize my dream. Dad. That's what you call fate. Something you must do even if you want to avoid doing it. The Emergency Medical Center is your fate. REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER OF A RIGHT ASSIGNER: LEE JONG-MIN ASSIGNEE: LEE CHO-IN Dad... If this fight is the fate you've given me, I won't back down. I'll realize your dream. Mr. Lee Jong-min, shall we go down now? Dad. Did you just move your finger? Dad! Dad, move your finger once if your answer is "yes", and move it twice if it's "no". Dad, can you hear me? Then... ...do you know who I am? Dad, is my name Lee Sun-woo? Dad. We're at Cheong-ju Sangdang Walls. The name originated from Sangdang-hyun, from the Baekje Period. I'll give you some time to take pictures. Make happy memories. Mr. Lee Cho-in, you're now happy with your family and loved ones, aren't you? Spring has come to Cheong-ju already. Please be happy like this warm spring weather. INTERVIEW FOR INTERNATIONAL COORDINATORS LEE SUN-WOO Let me take your picture. Let go! Who is he? He got beat up in some fight, got struck on the head. But he's refusing to get treatment. I guess he has a death wish. Don't hurt me. I'll kill whoever hurts me. Let go of me, you jerks! Choi Chi-soo... Oh Kang-ho? You're Kang-ho, aren't you? Oh Kang-ho. You're Kang-ho, aren't you? Right... I expected as much when I saw you in the desert. Then again, Kang-chul did say you could be a famous doctor from South Korea. Lee Cho-in... Is your real name Lee Cho-in? You know me, don't you? You're Kang-ho, aren't you? Mister, you have the wrong person. Don't play dumb, you jerk. You are Kang-ho. Oh Kang-ho, where's Young-ji? You're not together? What are you doing? Calm him down and send him to CT. Tell me. You're Oh Kang-ho, aren't you? Sir, you have the wrong person. Hold him down. Run a full lab on him, and EKG. Do a brain CT, too. Yes, sir. Sir, I'll see you after your tests. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES Dr. Lee, we have his test results. Subdural hematoma. Shall I call Neurosurgery and book an operating room? Doctor. Give me a minute. Choi Chi-soo, so we meet again. Oh Kang-ho. You might die if you don't get surgery... in 30 minutes. So, I'm going to open up your head and operate on you. That doesn't mean I'll let you live. What? Not everyone makes it out of surgery alive. You can look forward to it. You scumbag! Help me! Help me! Oh Kang-ho is going to kill me! I'm not getting surgery! Oh Kang-ho, you scumbag, you want your revenge? Get an operating room. We're going into surgery. -We're not going to call Neurosurgery? -You want to kill him while we wait? -I'll operate on him. -Yes, Doctor. Hello? Finish the job. Mr. Choe, finish the job. It must be wrapped up in Cheong-ju.
