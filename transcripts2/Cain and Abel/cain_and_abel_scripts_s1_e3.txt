 EPISODE 3 Tenderness at the McBurney's point. Suffering from rebound tenderness as well. You're a doctor, right? So do it here. I have to get better... and meet someone... But if I go to the hospital, I may never see this person... So can't you do the surgery here? Please, do the surgery here.

 I'm sure some hospitals take illegal immigrants. Get ready to go to the hospital. Mr. Lee! Knucklehead... And he calls himself a doctor... A hustler and a quack... Heartless knucklehead... Forceps, injector, scalpel... But no spinal anesthesia set. I'll apply the anesthesia in your spine. Here we go. Young-ji, I have a riddle. Guess where I'm pinching you. I don't know...

 Of course not, I haven't pinched you yet. Lift up your top and pull your pants down a bit. I can't do the surgery with clothes on. Leave the clothes on... Don't worry, you'll be fine. Young-ji, just listen to three songs. It'll be over by then, OK? Here we go. Pan-peritonitis will set in soon. I must get to the appendix. If it bursts, I can't do anything here. Thanks, little buddy. You haven't burst yet. Okay, closing up. Young-ji, the music isn't over yet, right? You're already finished? I told you I was good at this. A 64-year-old male. Tumors around the clivus. Pressure on the medulla oblongata. His vitals are stable. MCA was worked on 3 weeks ago, so we risk bleeding in that area. We can't lose concentration. You needn't worry, ma'am. The trustees on our side aren't affected by the will. What about Dean Choe? He's not picking up our calls. After all, he was one of the Director's Scholarship students. Excuse me. I'm in a meeting! What? Sun-woo set up the time for the Director's surgery? Okay. The Director's surgery? Ma'am, Sun-woo seems to have the wrong idea. If the Director wakes up, our plan comes crashing down. I'll take care of Sun-woo. You take care of Cho-in, Mr. Oh. I understand. You see that? I stitched you up nice and pretty. I see it... How can you see stitches on an X-ray? Well, I see your inside. It's quite a poo... ...pitch black! Stop it. I paid your bills and greased their palms a bit, too. So rest up for a couple of days. You're leaving? Yes, I have to go see Jeffrey's surgery results. So you're leaving for good? You're upset, aren't you? No, you have to go... By the way... You have to pass gas. What? We'll have a meal together before I go back to Korea. So just let it out. Okay. Take care. OK. Bye. You were supposed to have kidnapped him already. Lee Cho-in changed his itinerary... I apologize. No excuses! Take care of it now, or you won't see another cent! Damn! Oh Young-ji, where are you? Where am I...? Yes, where are you? And is Lee Cho-in with you? Boss... Mr. Lee just doesn't seem like a bad guy. He doesn't seem like a hustler. And he's really a doctor. I'm thinking you must be mistaken... You think this is a joke? I asked you where Lee Cho-in is! Well... I know that you're an illegal North Korean immigrant. Got that phone number for illegal immigration? He went to the hospital. The one that did the surgery? Yes... Oh Young-ji... I'll see you after I take care of Lee Cho-in. Hello...? Boss...? To the hospital! I oppose operating on your father. You want to get him back on his feet. All by yourself. I know you want him to revise his will. But what will that change? Mom. He only looked after Cho-in, anyway. Would that change when he wakes up? Even if you came back a renowned surgeon... He never wanted to give you the hospital! Why did Cho-in give up neurosurgery to join ER? Your father made him. If your father wakes up... the Neurosurgery Center project will go down. So will your dreams... And my hopes... You made me study medicine for this? Just as you wished... I performed surgery 17 hours a day... for seven years. And is this what I get, Dad? For having loved and trusted you... all my life. Pick up the phone, Sun-woo. Sun-woo. Hey, this is Su-rak. Where the heck is Sun-woo? He is busy giving a operation briefing now. What? He's going to operate on your father tomorrow. I'm a fellow here, and he always excludes me-- Okay, bye. Come on, Sun-woo... Mr. Lee, please pick up... Please pick up... Come on, pick up. Please... Young-ji? What are you doing here? Were you running? Are you okay? I'm fine. I really am. Can we change my flight to tonight? What? For tonight? He's not here. We couldn't find him. Damn it! He's right there! Follow him! And find out where that tramp Oh Young-ji lives. Yes, boss. Hurry up, please. I'm sorry. There are so many pickpockets in this city, so I keep the guests' passports at my place. It's okay. The flight's not till 9:30. How's your stomach? Fine. Can I take a picture of you? You only took pictures of the kids in Tolu. Here. Look over here. I take good photos. See, it's a really good one. By the way... Can you take one of me, too? I've been in Shanghai for five years... and all I have are ID photos. Smile! One, two... How did it turn out? You like it? Looks good. What's wrong? Don't you want a picture of us? No, it's not that... One, two... MY MAN I'll be on the 9:30 flight. You don't have to come to the airport. I mean it. I'm too busy anyway. I mean it. Mr. Lee! Here's your passport. Sorry for the delay. So this really is goodbye. Thanks for everything. No, I'm fine. You paid my hospital bills. Just take it, please. No. Keep this up, and I won't see you when you come to Korea. Then I'll take it. Thank you. Do you have to pick up your things at the hotel? Don't worry, and take care. I'll call you when I'm in town again. Goodbye. Have a safe trip. DR. LEE CHO-IN BOSUNG MEDICAL CENTER Miss Oh Young-ji. You got sick following me around. Sorry I couldn't do the surgery under better conditions. Disinfect the wound every day. And have the stitches taken out in three weeks. Remember to disinfect twice daily. Otherwise, it'll get inflamed. And start from the center of the wound. Watch that temper of yours and let the medicine dry on its own. And you have to watch for a few complications. Just in case. You don't want to get sick when you're on your own. Veggies are good for constipation. Don't skip any meals. And have more veggies. You're not okay until I say that you are! I hope you stay healthy. And I hope this helps. You're tough, so I have faith. And call me if you ever get to Korea. Lee Cho-in. Mr. Lee! Young-ji. Stop running, it's not good for you. Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. When I come to Korea, will you see me? Will you really? Thank you, Mr. Lee. They say that in South Korea, everyone scams everyone. But with someone like you, it won't be so scary. I'll make it to South Korea. Thank you, Mr. Lee... LEE CHO-IN 31 MISSED CALLS LEE CHO-IN Hey. Sun-woo, why didn't you pick up? I was busy. Don't schedule surgery for Dad. What? Your technique is too dangerous. Did Jeffrey's surgery fail? Yes, the patient is brain dead from a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Jeffrey lacks the surgical experience. That's not the issue. Although our dissertation was co-authored, I actually performed 96% of the surgeries. And 92.5% of those patients all regained consciousness. It's only been three weeks since I took care of Dad's aneurysm rupture. This surgery must not happen. I make that decision. You've been in ER for over a year now. It's not your decision. I'm a neurosurgeon, too. I am qualified. It's not just about removing the tumors. What? Dad can't turn out like Jeffrey's patient or Choe Yu-rah. So what will you do? I leave China tonight, so we'll talk later. You don't have to come back. The surgery will be over by then. Sun-woo... Lee Sun-woo! Lee Sun-woo... Dr. Nam Yong-tae? Get ready for the Director's surgery. We're about to start. Young-ji, you bought food and just left it. You're not Korean-Chinese? You fled from North Korea? Well... OPERATING ROOM Dr. Lee, do the Director's surgery after the board meeting. You cannot do this now. This is a family matter, Mr. Oh. Dr. Lee! Do you know what will happen if he wakes up? The Neurosurgery Center will never happen. I said this is a family matter! Stay out of it. Ma'am, if the Neurosurgery Center project goes down, Dr. Lee will bear the blame. I hope you realize that. Must you do your father's surgery now? Mom, I couldn't care less about inheriting the hospital. I wouldn't have come back for that. I want to be the first in the world to do the human brain mapping. Sun-woo! If anyone gets in my way... Whoever that may be, I won't forgive them. Whether it may be Dad or Cho-in... And then... You take care of the board meeting. I'll take care of Dad's surgery. Listen here. Yes, go ahead. Did you kidnap Lee Cho-in? We have him with us. He won't get back to Korea before that date. Don't you worry. Actually, don't send him back. For good. You do understand, don't you? For good. I understand. We're headed to the desert. And we're going to kill Lee Cho-in. We'll remove the chordoma developed at the skull base. Extended subfrontal transbasal approach and extreme lateral transcondylar approach will be used to remove the tumors. Scalpel. Let's begin. CURRENT LOCAL TIME 19:06 OPERATION TIME 0:00 CURRENT LOCAL TIME 01:33 Cho-in, is something wrong? You're not picking up. If you aren't coming tonight, can you call me? I'm scared. I'll wait for your call. CURRENT LOCAL TIME 01:50 Young-ji. My brother's passport... My parents' passports... They're all gone. I went through so much to get them. Those jerks from the Security Police must have taken them. But you have to flee. Those jerks know you're North Korean, and they know where you live. Young-ji, pack your things. I need a favor... Okay. I'll tell your brother, Oh Kang-chul, that you're okay. You better leave now though. Director Lee Jong-min. No matter what Sun-woo decides, you should not blame him. You have no right to blame Sun-woo. CURRENT LOCAL TIME 05:36 OPERATION TIME 10:32 Done with the extended subfrontal transbasal. Subfrontal transbasal, completed. Vital signs and anesthesia are normal. Watch out for hemostasis and wrap it up. Yes, sir. Prepare for the extreme lateral transcondylar approach. Dr. Lee, the patient is in a three-quarter position. Scalpel. Let's begin. OPERATION TIME 11:22 Deeper, you punks! Okay, boss. What is it that you want? Money? Do you want money! It's cold, hurry up. I don't know why you are doing this to me. But I have to go back to Korea. For my dad's surgery! I have to go back. So let me go! All done, boss. Very good. Dr. Lee Cho-in... We just follow orders. So don't blame us. Are you okay? Go get him! Sun-woo! Seo-yeon! Micro-scissors. Forceps. I'm sorry. Looks good. Make sure he's dead. I'll do it. Sure. What should we have for dinner? This is for the ring. Cho-in. You know how I get when someone goes missing. I'm really scared. Please call me. I just got Lee Cho-in's picture. You are sure he's dead? Very good. I'll wire the funds. As for the dead body... I'll call you back. Dead body? What were you talking about? You told me to handle Cho-in. I told you to delay his return, not to do anything like that. Tell them to stop, right now! Then what? We begged Sun-woo, but he's operating on the Director. What if the Director wakes up and Cho-in comes back? The Neurosurgery Center may never see the light of day. Still... This isn't right. Stop! No. Cho-in has already been eliminated. We're in this together now. Don't be so emotional and be realistic. See you at the board meeting, Vice-Director. Mr. Oh, you're a murderer... Did you hear the news about Dr. Lee Sun-woo? Dr. Kim from Anesthesiology told me. The Director's condition isn't urgent, right? So there's no need to rush. Did his situation deteriorate? No, I don't know the exact reason. Is Cho-in still not back? No, I haven't been able to reach him since yesterday. Dr. Kim, it's time for the board meeting. Try to get in touch with Cho-in. Yes, ma'am. I'll be chairing the meeting today. Trustees Kim Suk-joon, Jung Soon-yi, Lee Sun-woo, and Lee Cho-in are absent today. But two-thirds of the board is still here, so the vote will be valid. The main agenda for today is to decide whether we will build a Neurosurgery Center or an Emergency Center. Let's get to the vote. I would like to say something. You have all seen the Director's will. He has made his preference for the Emergency Center clear. It is only right for us to follow his wishes... Please. Have you thought about how we can fulfill his wishes? Wouldn't it be to get Bosung Medical Center out of the red which it has been in the last seven years? Which of the two centers gets built isn't the issue. I'd like to say something as well. Dr. Kim. How about letting your vote speak for itself? Sure. Then let's go onto the vote. BALLOT NEUROSURGERY VS EMERGENCY Neurosurgery Center. BALLOT COUNTING NEUROSURGERY VS EMERGENCY Emergency Medical Center. EMERGENCY CENTER 3 NEUROSURGERY CENTER 4 Don't worry, there are three votes left. Emergency Medical Center. Neurosurgery Center. NEUROSURGERY CENTER 5 Now, the last vote. EMERGENCY CENTER 4 NEUROSURGERY CENTER 5 And it is for... Even if Dean Choe turned on us, we have Dr. Jo's vote left. We helped approve his anticonvulsant experiment. He wouldn't betray us. And the last vote is for... Sun-woo. Why do you insist on becoming a heart surgeon? Is it because of Seo-yeon? I won't tell you again, become a neurosurgeon. Dr. Lee, do you need a break? We keep going. Micro-scissors. And the last vote is for... NEUROSURGERY VS EMERGENCY The Emergency Medical Center. NEUROSURGERY CENTER 5 EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER 5 Congrats. You guys owe me one. IN OPERATION Good job, everyone. Thank you, sir. OPERATION TIME 17:30 And you too, sir. Thank you for surviving. The CT scans are done. Let's see the ones from before the surgery, too. Clean. The chordoma tumors are completely gone. It's a success. Good job, Jin-geun. Come on, 17 and a half hours is nothing. And I've got a strong lower body. But your legs are wobbly. Punk, it's me celebrating by dancing. When he wakes up, he will choose the Emergency Center. But we'll have to wait and see. Brain surgery can have severe complications. What happened? I'm tired. Leave me alone. You want to be the first to do the human brain mapping. And whoever gets in your way... Whether it be your father or Cho-in... You said you wouldn't forgive them. And I trusted you... Mom. About being the first in the world to do the brain mapping... I meant every word. Over here. Give me the money. You get the upper bunk. Thank you. The Director is awake? Yes, he's conscious and breathing on his own. What do we do now, ma'am? Sir, move your hands. How are your legs? Can you feel anything? Do you feel that? Say something, sir. It's me, Jin-geun. Say something, Director. Dr. Jo... Dr. Kim. It seems like he has no sensations or motor skills. What? You said it was a success, and we saw the scans. What do you mean? He might just remain a vegetable? That's possible. My goodness... That means that Sun-woo removed more than he should have, right? Jin-geun, how dare you! -Huh? -No... Suggesting that Sun-woo did this intentionally? Sun-woo wasn't the only surgeon there. You were there, too! Let's go. Ma'am, the anesthesiologist got a little worked up. I'll make sure that he watches what he says. He sure is quick. Anyway, Jo Hyun-taig will be on our side soon. But Sun-woo's surgical skills are beyond compare. He made the Director conscious, giving a boost to the Neurosurgery Center. But only as a vegetable who can't express himself. Incredible, indeed. Watch your words, someone might hear. I'm sorry. It's just that the results are exactly what we wished for... Show yourselves out. Look at me now. Sun-woo can't feel good about having done this. And neither can I after our 38 years together. Feel free to blame me, Director Lee Jong-min. But not our son, Sun-woo. I'll carry his sins to my grave. I don't remember. We announce the construction of the Neurosurgery Center. I don't remember anything... Tell him I will wait for him in Korea. Not even my name or who I was... I don't remember. Until you regain your memory... They are looking for you and your brother. Oh Young-ji! Maybe I'll remember when I'm dead. So just shoot me! Kill me now!
