 We know what happened at the boathouse. I've got police officers searching my house. We've just found Andrew Earlham's car key in your flat. We're talking to anyone with a connection to Mr Earlham. Well, I-I never met the man. The police will want to talk to us, ask about what Andrew did to me. Do this, and I'm gone. And you really think I can just walk in using your card? We've got a 16-year-old male. He threw himself off the pier. It's Andrew Earlham's son. Laura Nielson, you are under arrest for the murder of Andrew Earlham.

 Right, then, are we ready, ladies? Thanks for keeping us waiting, Detective (!) If you'd just like to follow me. I hope you don't mind, I, er... I need to grab my coffee. What the hell is that? Really, Detective? Oh, no, sorry. You shouldn't have seen that. Why is that on your desk? What's he got to do with this? The interview room is just down these stairs. What was Ian arrested for? That was a cheap, sad little trick, Detective. If we end up in court, let's see how that plays in front of a jury. See you there.

 The most important thing is to take your time. Think about your answers. Do not be rushed. OK? I don't have anything to hide. Doesn't matter. They'll do whatever they can to unsettle you. I've had clients say all kinds of bollocks. The innocent ones are the worst. Are you ready? Hello, Laura. Do you want anything? A glass of water? I want to know why you've got Ian's mugshot on your desk. To throw you off balance, which is why you should ignore it. Maybe your boyfriend isn't who you think he is. What's that supposed to mean? Well, let's just say he wasn't arrested for a parking ticket. DI Renton! If you have questions for my client, ask them. We're done with the amateur theatrics. Start the record, please. DS Rory Maxwell. Can I ask you both to introduce yourselves, please? Ruby Allen, solicitor. Where have you been? We should have started already. Sorry, I was with a patient. Now we have to push every other operation back... I said I'm sorry, OK? If it's not too much trouble... there's a patient in there who'd like a spinal anaesthetic. Don't mind him. He's on a double. SIGHS {\an8}What are you doing? Those have been on the floor. Oh, right. Katie. Oh, sorry. I'm a bit knackered. Are you all right? I'm fine. What is it, Nick? You need to go home. I'm fine. You've been drinking. No, I haven't! I had a few drinks last night, but... I don't care when it was. I can still smell it. I'm pretty sure I don't need a breathalyser to tell me you're still over the limit. Go home. What will you say? I'll tell them you didn't feel well. Thank you. But you need to sort this out. I-I'm fine. I just... I just had a late night, that's all. Right. I'm sorry, Laura. I don't think you're being entirely truthful with us. Well, that's your opinion, Detective. It's also your burden to prove in court. Do you have any further questions? Yes, I do. Thanks for asking. Andrew Earlham's car. Now, you've driven it before, haven't you? Let me remind you of my advice. I have no comment. Of course you don't. Let's recap. Before you found those recordings, you drugged Earlham, then you drove his car to that boathouse. There's no proof of this boathouse incident. Oh, so you think a sworn statement of a serving police detective who was there doesn't count? I need to see that statement before I can advise my client. For your next magic trick, do you want to explain how Earlham's car key got into your client's home? Because someone put it there. Laura. Someone... Someone, who? I don't know. And this mysterious someone, did they also put Mr Earlham's blood on that key? It wasn't me. That's enough. Let's pick this up tomorrow. The time is, oh, 6.41 PM. And I'm terminating this interview while we make further enquiries. You do know what Andrew Earlham did, right? I don't care. This is a murder enquiry. It's this way. Tonight's prize is another overnight stay with us. It's not optional. I thought you said... We can hold you for 36 hours. We'd rather have you where we can keep an eye on you. I'll come back tomorrow. You don't need to stick me in a bloody cell. Just another tactic. Stay strong, OK? I'll make sure you're home by the morning. SHOUTING Get off me! Fuck off! Shoes off. I know! What now? Nothing. You don't think she should be in there. I didn't say that. It's just... You seem so damn sure it's her. Not necessarily, but sometimes the most obvious explanation is also the correct one, so we'll follow this, see where it takes us. I don't think... She's staying here tonight. Dad? Been making friends again? Yeah, something like that. DI Renton, this is my boy Greg. A rising star of the NCA. Dad! Well, it's true. They've just promoted him to branch commander. That makes him the youngest BC they've had. Oh, very good. We should crack on. Good to meet you, Greg. Fun. You don't know the half of it, mate. You OK? Yeah. Top of the world. I'll see you later. Yeah. Rory! Fingerprints are back. Oh. FOOTSTEPS Andrew? In here. Watch your head. Oh, am I glad to see you! You, too. Thank you. Thank you so much for doing that. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Yeah... Did anyone see you? No. Good. Good. Your stuff from the locker. Passport, money. What about the car? I dropped the key. And then someone came, and I panicked. I'm sorry. No, no, it's fine. This is more than enough. Where are you gonna go? I don't know. Far away from here. Probably wait until it gets dark, and then I'm gone. Good luck. Thanks. You all right? When I was at the hospital... ..I saw your son. What was he doing there? He was being rushed into surgery. I couldn't follow them, but, erm... I heard the doctors say he tried to kill himself. No. No, no, no. You've got it wrong. It's what I heard. No. No, he didn't. There's no w... Oh! HE GROANS Oh, God, no! No, he... Why would he? I've got to go see him. I don't think that's a good idea. Oliver, I'm gonna go see him. Get out of my way! I've got to see him! Please don't. Please. Let me go. Andrew, it's too dangerous! Andrew. There's police everywhere looking for you. They won't expect me to walk back into the hospital. I've just been there! Look, I know the place inside out. I can get in, I can see him, and I can do it all without... He's my boy. My only son. I said I would always be there for him. I said he would never have to go through anything alone. I'm so sorry. I get it. You're gonna have to take me. I can't drive you. I need to go home. Mate... you're the only one I've got. Look, after everything we've been through. Everything I've done for you. Please think about that. I would do the same for you. You know I would. Yeah. Thanks, mate. DOOR OPENS OK, let's go. Good morning. Sign here. You're being released on police bail for four weeks. And here. For your belongings. Come on, I'll show you out. CHATTER SHOUTING Laura! Laura! THEY CONTINUE SHOUTING What the hell? Wow, someone's popular! Must have been a leak. Weird, that. You did this, didn't you? Not just us keeping an eye on you now, Laura. SHOUTING CONTINUES You're streaming live! What do you want to say to the people? Hello. Hello. I'd like to speak to Ian Davis. PHONE: 'First new message.' LAURA: 'Hey, it's me...' Ian. The police are here to see you. Can I help you? Ian Davis. You're under arrest. I... I don't understand. Why? We have reason to believe that you were involved in the disposal of the body of Andrew Earlham. We are arresting you for assisting an offender. Are you serious? Yes. Very. Ian Davis, you do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. ON PHONE: 'Hi, it's Ian. Please leave me a message.' Hey. It's me again. Please, can you call me? Hey. Thank you. Hey. Come here. How are you doing? I've been better. Thanks for coming. Of course. Did you get any sleep? No. I can't sleep at home, never mind here. Right. Come on. I'll take you back to your place, and get your stuff, then I'm gonna set up a spare room at mine. Thanks, but I'll be OK. Listen, there's gonna be press at your place, too, you know. It's fine. They're gonna do what they want, and write what they want. "Victim takes revenge and kills her rapist." Stop. OK? Don't call yourself that. It's what I am. A victim. I couldn't stop Andrew doing what he did to me, and I can't stop what's happening now. Listen to me. Everything they have is circumstantial. And that's what matters. If they had anything, they wouldn't have let you go. Oh, hang on. Thanks. Won't be long. There you are. You think I should text this to her? Yeah. If you want a second date. And what I wrote? Nah. Trust me, it'll work. Thanks. I owe you. Hopefully. Are you OK? Yeah, fine. Hi, Katie. How are you? Yeah, good. Another long shift? Yeah. Almost finished. OK. Thank you. Bye. Sorry, mate. You didn't deserve this. Look at you. TEARFULLY: My boy. HE SNIFFS I'm still your dad. You hear me? Everything they're saying, it's not me. It's not who I am. You know that, right? You and me, that was real. That's what it was all about. I don't want this to be the last thing that happens in your life. I could never forgive myself. It's her fault. Laura's. All of this. Hi, there. It's Rod, isn't it? I just wanted to check on a patient. If she hadn't... She put you here. If it wasn't for her, I... DOCTOR AND KATIE TALKING OUTSIDE He's in bed two. Oh, bed two. Great. Thanks. HE SIGHS I'm sorry, mate. I've gotta go. I love you. I'll be back later. REPORTERS SHOUT Laura, can you tell us about the allegations that have been brought against you, please? Are you being charged? How long have you been with Ian Davis? Why are you asking me about Ian? There's reports he's being questioned in connection with Earlham's murder. Care to comment? You didn't know, did you? Did you plan it together? Or was Ian working alone? Laura, come on, give us something! SHOUTING CONTINUES RECORDING: 'Hi, it's Ian. Please leave me a message.' Hi, it's me. Where are you? Call me back. Did his solicitor say how long she'd be? No. I think she's stuck in traffic. We can just sit here, if you want? In silence. Bit boring, but... Won't be the first time. I'm not stupid. I know what you're doing. Ooh, please enlighten me. What are we doing? Hoping you can unsettle me. Hoping I lose my nerve and say something you can use against Laura. You're wasting your time. No, you don't have to talk. That's your right. I'm just gonna talk to Rory. Do you really think a jury will believe that Laura took Andrew Earlham out to the middle of those marshes all by herself? No. Well, he says that he was at home when Earlham was killed, but is that true? Now, we know that he made a call to Laura that morning. Perhaps that's when she asked him to help her. Moving the body. Did you help her move the body? Come on, this is your chance. You could help her here. I want my solicitor. We know about you, Ian. We know about Alexander Slater, and the jury will know about this, too. You're not a violent man, not usually, but you can get angry. You're one of those. You have a limit, and when you reach that point, you just explode. Like you did with Alexander Slater. You beat him so hard you put him in intensive care. But because he deserved it, right? And that's what you do to people who deserve it. You show them how it feels. I wanna hear your side of the story. I'm more than happy to wait for your solicitor. But there's something that I want you to know. Karen, I think we should wait. We know about that car key. What car key? What the hell do you think you have? Andrew Earlham's car key. It was found in Laura's flat, with traces of his blood on it. And your fingerprints. What?! I know! Is she always like this? Do you always have to work with somebody like this? You're right. I think we should wait for your solicitor. So you have my fingerprints on a key in Laura's house? KNOCK ON DOOR There she is. No rush. Hi. Thanks for meeting me. It's not like I have a job to go to at the moment. I'm guessing you heard I got arrested? It's not what I wanted. You told them I drugged Andrew and dragged him to the boathouse. What did you think would happen? It's a murder case now. I had no choice. Don't pretend you were doing the right thing. You were covering your arse. They were gonna find out. I thought it was better to get ahead of it. Better for you, maybe. Not me. I'm sorry. OK? I don't know what else you want me to say. Nothing. I don't want you to say anything. I... I want your help. Excuse me? The guy I'm seeing, he's got a criminal record. Detective Renton made sure I found out. I was hoping you might be able to tell me what it was for. Laura... I had no idea he'd ever been arrested for anything. That's something you're gonna have to ask him. I can't! He's being questioned by the police. Even if I wanted to - which I don't - I'm suspended. Look, I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important. If it wasn't... I really liked Andrew. I had no idea who he was. What if I've done it again? Look, it's gonna be hard for you to trust anyone. Of course it is. Ian is the only good thing to happen to me in a long time. I just want to know who he is. I'm not asking for you to tell me about the case, just him. Ian Davis. You owe me that. Don't you? TV PLAYS BRAKES SCREECH What are you bloody doing?! Trying to kill us?! It's a zebra crossing. I'm sorry. BABY CRIES Oh, God. SHE BREATHES HEAVILY Hi. Hi, it's me. Erm... I need your help. SHE SOBS Carl! Carl! You didn't turn up for our session. Sorry. I'm sorry, I was busy. I tried calling. I've been outside, working. That's all you're gonna say? Carl?! It happened to me. Me! Not you. Me! I know! Don't you think I know?! There's something you need to know. What? It doesn't matter. What?! What is it?! I said I'm sorry I missed it, all right? Shit happens, end of. I've got work to do. SIRENS IN DISTANCE Jesus. How is he? Can you take me to Craigmin Road? It's on the seafront. Well, I thought we were just... Just do it. Please. CAR STARTS Where are we? You should've seen him. My boy. Lying in that bed. Like he was just asleep. Like I could reach out and... It was her. She did this to him. If she hadn't opened her bitch mouth... Is this her house? I won't be long. Andrew, wait! Oh, for God's sakes. DOOR OPENS ON PHONE: 'First new message. 'Hi, Laura. 'It's DI Harmon. Just checking in. 'Still no leads in the search for Andrew Earlham.' MESSAGE CONTINUES PLAYING DOOR BUZZES Hi. Hi. I'm Winnie. I work at the hospital. With your sister. Sorry, we texted yesterday. You said I could come around. I'm sorry. I completely forgot. Oh, if it's a bad time? No, it's fine. Honestly. Are you OK? Er... I just, er... I wanted to talk, actually. I saw you on the news, and... You live so close, I just felt like I had to get in touch. Given we both, erm... I was on those recordings, too. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. No, no, no. It's fine. Um... Look, the White Lion's just round the corner. Why don't we grab a drink? OK. I'll just get my coat. Thanks. Let's get a glass of wine. Alexander Slater. I'm sorry? Does that name mean anything to you? No. Should it? Your man Ian beat him so hard he put him in intensive care. Why? I don't know. That's all my mate could tell me. There must be a reason. He couldn't... I... I can't imagine him doing that. The only predictable thing about people is how bloody unpredictable they are. Also, you didn't hear this from me, but you're gonna find out anyway, probably, Ian's fingerprints are on that car key. What? I'm glad you called. I've been worried about you. I, erm... I've... I've been drinking. More than... You know I like a glass of wine or two. I need to drink to get me through the day. Every day. All the time. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry. I'm gonna sort myself out. Good. That's good. And you know what, I'm... I'm here. So I'll help. However I can. Yeah, we can... We can find someone you can talk to about all this. I just need to get a grip. You don't have to do this by yourself. Stop being so bloody understanding! Thank you. Don't tell Laura. I saw the news. She's got enough shit to deal with. No, no, of course. Of course. You should call her. She doesn't want to hear from me. You don't know that. Just... Keep an eye on her for me, will you? Yeah. Always. PHONE RINGS Hi. Hi. It's me. Where are you? We need to talk. No shit. Thanks. Why are you looking at me like that? Why do you think? I dunno. Well, go on, then? You think you have all the answers. Where do I start? How about Alexander Slater? I was gonna tell you. It's not a big deal. Not any more. I just... I got into a fight with some prick who was taking the piss out of my sister, who's in a wheelchair, and I... I'm not proud of it, but... It was an accident. I didn't mean to put him in hospital. I did go to prison. But I'm not Andrew Earlham, OK? I'm not hiding some dark side of me. When? Excuse me? When were you going to tell me? I don't know. I mean... Eventually. Now. I mean, what's the rule? You wait three months until you tell someone about your previous convictions? The police told me about the car key. They said your fingerprints were on it. What, you think I put that in your house? I don't bloody know! I don't know what to think about anything any more. I just... How do you explain that? I just want you to be honest with me. My phone was out of battery. I went looking for a charger. I opened a drawer in the bedroom, and I touched it when I was rummaging around. I didn't even know what it was at the time. That's what you told the police? They didn't believe me either! When they questioned me about the day of the murder, I was in shock. I was taken aback. And when I calmed down, I remembered, I got a delivery that day. A bottle of champagne from a client. They tracked down the courier, and it checked out. So guess what, I didn't kill anyone! You know, it's bad enough to have the police drag me in and accuse me, but have you look at me... You don't trust me! I do trust you. No, you don't! Because if you did, you wouldn't have spent the whole day believing that I was capable of being involved in something like this. And it's not just me, you can't trust anyone. And after everything you've been through, I do get it, but... Until you can, maybe we should... We should just go our separate ways. Ian... Maybe this just isn't the right time for us. Let's just nip this in the bud before we both get too hurt. Goodbye, Laura. What are you doing standing out here? I need to talk to you. OK. Whoa. Not here. Not with Mum. What's going on, mate? You're scaring me. Dad... What did I just say? OK. Let's go to the pub. Perfect. ON TV: We are pursuing a number of lines of enquiry, which we are not at liberty to discuss. However, what I can tell you is that Laura Nielson was questioned on the matter, but released without charge. So, what's next for the enquiry? As I just said, we have a number of promising leads, and we expect to make an arrest in the next few days. Thank you very much for your time. The release of Laura Nielson seems to suggest that Thanet and Dover Police have a new prime suspect. SIRENS OUTSIDE SIRENS I'm gonna head back to the car. Yeah. Yeah, of course. If she had come into the room... ..what would you have done? Would you have killed her? No. I'm no murderer. All right? I may be a lot of things, but I'm not that. Get on the boat, Andrew. Maybe there's a way out of this? You know? Maybe if I got hold of those recordings, destroyed them, maybe there's a way they're inadmissible in court. Let it go. Run. While you still can. Yeah, sorry. Sorry I dragged you into this. It's OK. Bye, Andrew. Bye, mate. A lot of people are looking for you... Andrew Earlham. Do I know you? No. But I know you. And I know what you did to my wife.
