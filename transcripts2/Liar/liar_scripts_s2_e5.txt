 Previously on Liar... I know what you did to my wife. I'm suspended until they put me in front of a disciplinary board. Just found Andrew Earlham's car key in your flat. This is the last address she entered, right before Earlham died. We found it, Laura. Found what?! You owe it to yourself, Greg. You owe it to me! Threw himself off the pier, looks like the current pulled him back into the pillars. It's Andrew Earlham's son. If it wasn't for you, my son wouldn't be lying half-dead in a hospital right now.

 You did that! 'You stole my life. Now I'm gonna steal yours.' Police! DOGS BARKING Anything you want to say to us, Laura? Unless you have new questions for my client, this is a waste of everyone's time. Oh, don't you worry, Miss Allen, we're not here to repeat ourselves. We've found the shipping container. What? Your sat nav, it led us right to it. It's a good job, really, cos I don't think anyone's been in that container yard for a very long time. Must be why Andrew holed up there. How did you find him?

 I have no idea what you're talking about. Right, I'm gonna be straight with you both now. This "I don't know" routine, it isn't gonna work for you any more. You left something there. It's your necklace, isn't it? It's got your DNA all over it. And you see that blood? It's Andrew Earlham's. Was all over the floor of the shipping container. Game over, Laura. It's time to tell the truth. I don't understand. What...? My client has nothing to say. Your necklace, your DNA. Your silence is not gonna explain that away. Someone must've taken it when they... when they put the car key in my flat. Oh, wow, this "someone", they are going to a hell of a lot of bother. I don't know anything about a shipping container. Why... Why would my sat nav take you somewhere I've never even been? You can't even look at me. I'm just doing my job. I brought those recordings of Andrew to you. I trusted you. Miss Nielson, we have enough to approach the CPS and ask for a charge of murder. What happens now is up to you. If you explain to us exactly what transpired... My client has nothing to say. You'll be staying with us until your bail hearing. Could be tomorrow, but don't hold your breath. She has long-standing ties to the community and the recent publicity has put my client very much in the public eye, making her even less of a probable flight risk. Finally, we have to consider her spotless record and the circumstances of the crime with which she is charged. There's no history of violence here, no indication she poses a threat to anyone else, and given the presumption of innocence, no reason to refuse bail. Do the Crown have any objection? No, madam. Bail is granted for Miss Nielson, on condition that she surrender her passport and report to the local police station every 24 hours. She is to stay within a 30-mile radius. Thank you. That's it? That's it. We're talking about whether or not I'm locked up and it's over in less than five minutes? Not over yet, I'm afraid. No. I know. I'll see you soon. Ignore her. She's just trying to mess with your head. It's working. So, we'll meet next week, talk it all through. Make a plan. Hey. Good result. The right result. Thank you. I'm just glad they saw sense. It's not always like that. Right, I'm late for my serial flasher. Try to relax over the next few days. Easier said than done, I know, but, er... I'll be in touch. So, how are you feeling? You know, I just, um... I just need a second. Yeah, yeah, sure. Of course. Um... I'll wait for you outside, yeah? Yeah. Sorry. Hey, don't be. It's fine. Listen, er, Katy didn't know whether to come. She wanted to, but... It's such a mess, me and her. Come on, I'll drop you off. Thanks, but I... I'm OK. I... There's somewhere I need to go first. Where? Detective Harmon's. I don't think that's a good idea. I don't have a choice. I just need this to end. One way or another. Laura! Have you heard about what they've found? No, I'm still suspended. Come in. There's a shipping container. Andrew's blood, my DNA, my necklace... I'm gonna be put on trial for murder. Hold on, just wait. They tracked the sat nav in my car. A car I haven't driven for two weeks. Couldn't have driven, the battery died. Slow down! My car's been in the police compound since I was arrested. Someone got to it there. Someone has messed with my sat nav. No. Laura, no. They must have... They must have had to sign in, right? So you could find out. OK, and if I do, what then? What are you gonna learn? What... DI Renton, she's been hell-bent on proving it's me. Yeah, but that's a long way from trying to set you up. I don't know, OK? I don't know why anyone would do it, but I'm telling you someone is. OK, so you say you didn't do this. So fight it. In court. Cos that worked out so well after Andrew raped me (!) After what he did to us, he was allowed to just keep walking around free. If I'd have listened to people then, and just kept my mouth shut, he'd still be here, living his life. I just need to find out who else might have had access to my car. There's not a lot I can do without my badge. You know that, yeah? Anything you can do. That's all I ask. All right, Luke. I'm gonna take this tube out, OK? So I need a big cough from you on three. One, two, three. HE COUGHS Fantastic, mate. Fantastic. OK, OK, you're OK. You're OK, hey, hey. Stay calm for me, Luke. You stay calm for me. You're safe, all right? Now, listen. You've had us all worried about you. Luke, you're through the woods now, you're gonna be OK. HE SPLUTTERS What's that, mate? Dad. Your dad? He's... He's still missing, mate. PHONE BUZZES Hello? ANDREW: 'It's me. 'I need you to come back.' I'm still here. I'm still in England. 'It's been a week, you should be gone, you should be far away.' 'The only way I'm gonna get out of this shit-storm' is if people think that I'm dead. And that's where you come in. Don't call me again. I know you, Olly. No-one else does. 'But I do. I still have that recording.' You and that man. I never deleted it. 'So that's how it is.' Look, I've got no choice. And you're burning my life down to the ground, for what? So you can punish Laura? 'She put my son in hospital.' One last time. And, mate, after that, look, I swear you'll never hear from me again. Don't call me "mate". 'And don't pretend this is a favour.' What do you need me to do? Hi, Rochelle. Hey. Are you back on duty? No, I just... left a bunch of stuff here, so... thought I'd take a break from Googling pushchairs. You'll be back before you know it. Hope so. Listen, do you think I could borrow your pass? The door's closed and I can't get back to go to the loo. Sure. No problem. Is that all right? Yeah, of course. Oh, thanks so much. There you go. Cheers. All right, then. I'll be right back. OK. Hi, vehicle pound, please. Yeah, it's DC Rochelle Thompson. Vehicle crime team. Badge number 17028767. Thanks. 'It's a dead-end.' No-one logged in to see your car except for the people investigating you. Who else could've got access to my car? No-one. 'So it has to be one of them.' Does the log show what time they arrived? Was Renton first? No. Rory was first, by ten minutes. 'I wanna help you, but this isn't going anywhere.' Rory? No. 'Ten minutes would be enough.' Rory couldn't hack a sat nav, he can barely cope with more than one number for his own pin code. So, he looked it up. Or he had help. Laura, I'm trying to help you here, OK? But I know Rory. He's a good man. A good cop. There's no way he would do anything like this. 'Weren't you the one who said people are unpredictable?' Thank you for trying. All right, good luck. Six o'clock, Christopher's. Six o'clock at Christopher's. Yes! I know it's early, it's all I could get. I'd better go. Er, I'll see you there. OK. Christopher's. Nice. Special occasion? What do you want? Did you alter my sat nav? SIGHS Go home. There was a man helping Andrew Earlham. They were seen together just before Andrew died. He was wearing a blue cap. Was that you? Drop it. You're just making everything worse. I've been charged with murder. How could it be worse? Yeah. Thank you. Hello. Where've you been? Out. That's specific (!) That was forensics on the phone. The initial report on the shipping container's through. And? Blood spatter's inconclusive. Seems there was a struggle, the blood got badly smeared. Do they know that it's consistent, at least, with Earlham's wounds? They're hedging their bets. They sending a report through? It'll be in your inbox in a few minutes. I'll take a look. There's something else. Laura's sat nav. They had no prints. I mean, literally no prints. Not even any partials? No. Someone must have wiped it clean. Huh. Weird. Yes, Rory. Weird. I'll put the report on your desk. You take it for granted, don't you? That life will just carry on like it is. It's only when you realise it could all be taken away from you that you really appreciate it. You'll be OK. The only move I have left is... It's pretty desperate. If it blows up in my face it makes everything worse. When's the last time you backed down? There's your answer. MAN: Table for two. Maxwell. WAITRESS: May I take your coats, please? WOMAN: Thank you. Your table's ready. Hi. Walk away. You go ahead, love, and sit down. Yeah, right. Don't want your wife to hear about what you've been up to. I've warned you before. You carry on like this, and I will arrest you. You couldn't even look at me at the station. Cos you know that I never went near that shipping container. You know that you... This is over. You know... I'm going for dinner. You go home and sober up. If you follow me, you'll be spending the rest of the night in a cell. Have you got that, Laura? Yeah. Good. CHILDREN LAUGHING OK, boys, Daddy's here. CHILD: No, longer! All right, you've got five more minutes, OK? OK. How's Laura? Yeah, she's holding up. You really should've come to court. If she wanted me to be there, she should've called. One of you is gonna have to make the first move at some point. How bad is it? It's bad. They've found what they reckon is the crime scene. Andrew's blood, Laura's DNA. Oh, God. I know. It's one thing explaining away Andrew's car-key in her flat, but this... This to me is a whole other level. What do you mean, Andrew's car-key? It's why she got questioned in the first place. Shit. What? Oh, it's probably nothing. I found a car-key like Andrew's in the hospital locker room. It's not as if there's lots of those cars knocking around our town. So, what did you do with it? I got distracted. Oh, Luke Earlham was brought in. So I think I handed it in to lost property. Do you think it's the same one? I don't know. But I should check. What, go back to the hospital? Yeah. If they'll let me in. I'll... I'll come with you. What about the kids? I was gonna go to my mum's anyway. I can just drop the boys off and come meet you at the hospital. I can ask a few questions by myself, Liam. You know what, I don't doubt that. But you haven't seen Laura. I mean, you haven't seen how all of this has got to her. If there's anything that I can do to help, then... Well, I wanna do it. All right, then. Right, come on, boys. We're off. Olly, come on. We're gonna go see Nanny. PHONE VIBRATES Expecting to meet your dad? I texted you from his phone. What is this? A few days ago, you forwarded your dad an email. It was from an anonymous email address. Attached was your medical report. Showing that you, a police officer, had overdosed. Above it was the message, "What's Laura Nielson's freedom worth?" Not long after, the sat nav in my car magically leads the police to a murder scene. Let me get this straight. You stole a phone off my Dad - a police officer - and then you come to me - also a police officer. Have you lost your mind? Your dad has planted evidence. He did it for you, so your medical report wouldn't come out. This is way out of line. I'm being framed, and your dad's part of it, going against everything he stands for. For you. You knew what he was going to do and you let him just go ahead so you could save yourself. All you have is a phone you stole off a detective. The detective investigating your case. So, I'd think really hard about what you do next. Why did you become a police officer? Just so you could impress your dad? Or did you actually want to help people? Because what you're both doing goes against everything your job stands for. Do the right thing. I hear from you again, you're under arrest. Piss off. Hello, stranger. Hi, Debbie. Have you been on holiday? Yeah. Erm, I wanted to check something with you. I dropped a car key off in lost property about three weeks ago. Has anyone claimed it or signed it out? Let's have a look. Are you Liam? Yeah. You weren't lying, were you, love? Ah, here we are. Yeah. It was claimed the night of the 17th. Oh. Who by? Looks like a... Holden Caulfield. I doubt that. It's a fake name. It's from, erm, what's it? Catcher In The Rye. That's it. OK, thanks. Thanks, Debbie. Erm... Hi. Katy! I need a favour. I need to look at some CCTV footage of the lost property area. Oh, you know we can't do that. Oh, did you go on that second date with Lucy? Can't believe you were right about that. "I owe you". Isn't that what you said? It is. Come. Night of the 17th. So, how did the second date go? Good enough for me to be going on my fifth tonight. Where should I take her? I don't know. Our fifth date was awful. Was it? Yeah. Don't you remember? You were supposed to take me to a gig, but we got the wrong night so we ended up eating chips in a car park. Yeah. Was still fun, though. Yeah. It was. Stop there. What time is that? Ten at night. That's our Holden Caulfield. OK, but how do we find him? RADIO: 'And an update of the headlines again for you.' Morning. 'Police have confirmed a woman has been charged with the murder 'of alleged rapist Andrew Earlham. 'The woman, 38, has been named as Laura Nielson. 'A secondary school teacher, living in Kent. This morning...' PHONE RINGING Hello, is that Luke? Hi, Luke, my name's Oliver. I was wondering if we could meet up. It's about your mum. I need to speak to DS Maxwell. Is he expecting you? There's something I need to give to him in person. Excuse me. Hi. Are you Carl? Who's asking? I'm Katy. I'm Laura Nielson's sister. And I work with Winnie at the hospital. Liam. Laura's brother-in-law. What's this about? Erm, we're hoping you can help us with something. It's about Andrew Earlham. Laura said you... you saw him with someone, and we're trying to track him down. Here. Is that the same guy? I don't know if you're aware but I'm in enough trouble as it is, all right? I'm looking at doing time for torching my own boatyard so just... This I could do without, yeah? Please. I know Laura helped you out. We're just asking you to do the same for her. Yeah. That's him. I mean, look, it was dark, but... yeah. OK. Anything else you can tell us about him? I think I know where he's staying. Or where he was staying, anyway. He made his way back to his hotel, that shithole. The Marina Inn. Yeah. Who is he? That's what we're trying to find out. Thank you. All right. Thanks so much. They called up and said someone had found my phone. You should really have had it cut off by now. Then again, you shouldn't have a one-digit PIN. Being a technophobe can really bite you in the arse. What are you playing at? I'm guessing your son hasn't contacted you, then? Give me one reason why I shouldn't place you under arrest right now. Because I know what you did. Outside. Come on. PHONE BUZZING DI Renton. 'Oh, hi. This is Henry Grantham from the Parole Board.' Hello. 'Miss Renton, I'm calling about Anthony Farr. 'There was a note on his file that said to inform you 'when he was released.' Anthony's out. And did this happen today? 'It was actually a couple of weeks ago now. 'Apologies, this one must've slipped through the system. 'We've been updating our networks.' Yes, thank you for calling. Your son has been admitted to A&E; three times for cocaine toxicity. A few days ago, he received an anonymous email containing his medical report, which he forwarded to you. Then you had a choice - you let the report be released and see your son's career go up in smoke, or frame me. Maybe you tampered with my sat nav yourself. But given your low-tech PIN code, I'm guessing you gave it to someone else to do that, then you planted it back in my car. How am I doing? Oh, good story. Got any proof? I spoke to him. I know I'm right. I've got the email. I've got the medical report. Which you obtained illegally. Do you think people will care? You think if the press find out there's a police officer getting high on the job, there won't be an investigation? You have no idea what that boy's been through. How hard he's worked to get ahead. So, he slips up, he's gonna lose everything? His career, his family. My wife has not been well. She'd be devastated. This will bloody destroy her. I have a family too. A job, a life. But you're OK with that? It's him or me, is that how it is? You don't have kids. You don't understand. I understand what it means to do the right thing. Who sent your son that email? That's who should be looking at time in prison, not me! My boy put a lot of bad people behind bars. If that medical report goes public, every case he ever closed will be open. And those people, men like Andrew Earlham, there's a chance they'll be put back on the street again. That's how you justify lying? You wanna open that Pandora's box, go ahead. Your call. You have to tell the truth! I'm sorry. Way past that now. We're looking for someone. A friend staying at the hotel. You got a name? I can call his room for you if you'd like. Erm... Erm... Can't be a very good friend. We really need to get hold of him. It's urgent. I'm sorry, I can't help you. We value the privacy of our guests here. Yeah. So, what do we do now? We wait. We see if comes back or leaves. But for how long? We can't leave this, Liam. What if he's the one that was setting up Laura? Katy, we've been assuming this whole time that the same person that's been setting up Laura is the same person that killed Andrew, but... But what? A lot of people wanted Andrew dead. DI Renton? Yes? I'm DI Michael McCoy. Wondered if we could have a quick word? Erm... sure. Thanks. Your ex is Anthony Farr? Yeah. Have you spoken to him recently? No. The last conversation we had, he called me a lying slag for reporting him. Why? You know he got out a couple of weeks ago? Yeah, yes, I did hear. Right after getting out, he shacked up with Stephanie Pike. You know her? Yeah, yeah, he mentioned her a few times. They were together before we met. His ex. They got back in touch when he was inside. Picked up right where they left off. What are you doing here, Detective? Last night, he beat her so badly, she ended up in A&E.; She died this morning. My God. Look, Farr's on the run. I was hoping he might've been in touch, or maybe you know where he might go. I know this is hard, but if there's anything, anything you can give me. He'd cry. He'd hit me and he'd cry. Say he was sorry. So sorry. I believed him. I haven't heard from him, but if he's looking to hide out somewhere, his cousin is your best bet. Dan Walker. He's a nasty piece of work, loyal as hell to Anthony. Whenever I kicked him out, that's where he went. Dan Walker. He was on our list. Well, you move him to the top of your list. I will. Thank you. Is there something else, Detective? It's easy to blame yourself. Don't. It's very kind of you, but I've been on your side, I've said exactly the same thing, and I didn't believe it then. Thanks for your help. You're welcome. PHONE VIBRATES Yes, DI Renton. I just need to speak to her. Well, somebody else in the department, then. I... I don't know who. I just need to talk to someone about DS Maxwell. Laura Nielson. Well, when will someone call me back? Fine, fine. Sorry. I regret it. I know you don't want to or need to hear this right now, but I need to say it. I made a mistake. A mistake is coming home later than you said you would. It's... calling me by your ex's name. It's not cheating on me. Look, I'm only here for Laura. I wasn't happy. I know I should have been. A husband, two gorgeous kids, but... I felt plain. Old. Invisible. It's not an excuse, it's just how I felt. You think I didn't have those same thoughts? I don't regret giving up my job, all right? It made sense. You would go out to work, earn the money and I would stay at home and be with the boys. We agreed on that. But... You get in your head a lot, when you're at home, just by yourself, with the kids. You start second-guessing everything. It was me. I stopped feeling like the kind of man that you'd find attractive. I just, kind of, stopped trying. Liam... Please, no. He's here. What do we do? I don't know, let's just wait and see. That's his car. Shall we follow him? Quick, quick, quick, go. Quick, we're gonna lose him. TYRES SCREECH Mate, move! Please, come on! HONKS HORN Move! Oh, my God! For God's sake. Move out the way! Jesus! Ridiculous. Where's he gone? Shit! Where did he go? What's going on? Why are you both here? Do you remember that guy you told me about, he had a blue cap, he was seen with Andrew? Yeah. We know where he is. What? He took Andrew's car key from the hospital. Show her the picture. This is him. This is the man that's been setting me up. He's the one blackmailing DS Maxwell. Why would someone you've never met go to such lengths to frame you? Maybe he's got something to hide. Maybe he killed Andrew. You must have enough. I can do more. Fine. How much longer? Until I'm done. No, not this. How much longer till I can go back to my life? This needs to be done right. Laura needs to answer for what she did to my son. I had to call in sick. I have a job. You're done when I say you're done. Where's the recording, Andy? It's safe. Where? The police have been all over your life, they've searched everything. I think they have it already. HE CHUCKLES You wouldn't be here if they did. Or maybe you're talking shit. Look, choose not to believe me, if you want. But we're so close. A few days, all of this will be over, you go back to your life. Now can we get on with this, please? COUNSELLOR: You're very quiet today. What do you want me to say? It's not about what I want you to say. This is your chance to talk. About your Dad. His disappearance. Why you tried to hurt yourself. Don't call it that. "Tried to hurt myself." Like it was a cry for help. I wanted to do it. I wanted to kill myself. I tried, I just... I fucked it up. And do you still feel that way? Luke? I was... Everything was a mess. I wasn't thinking properly. It just... It got too much. That's all. I don't think like that now. Everything was a mess because of what you learned about your father? Yeah. How would you feel if your dad got in touch? If he called you? It's OK to feel conflicting emotions, that's why you're here. He is a liar. He is evil. You wanna know how I feel? If I see him, he's dead.
