 - Need a hand? - I'm fine. Nicely done. Thanks. I can start my car all on my own, as well. - Sorry, I didn't mean to... - I'm joking. - How is it out there today? - Same as it always is. Perfect. Who needs church when you've got this? Yeah. - Well, enjoy. - Thanks. (SIGHS) - Hi, Laura. - Hi, Danny. (DOOR CLOSES)

 - Hey. - Hey. Er... Sorry, I thought you were back later. Yeah, well, the world's full of surprises. This is the last of it. - I left you Monty. - I won him for you. - Maybe I'll visit at weekends. - Don't think so. Has to be for good this time. Yeah. It's no-one's fault. Kinda makes it worse. I'd like us to stay friends. I know that sounds lame. But there aren't many people I've known since I was 13. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

 You don't fancy watching the game tonight, do you? Got these lovely salmon cakes in. You don't need to stay in every night, Dad. - I don't stay in every night. - When did you last go out? Well, I mean... you know, I'm busy at work - and got you to look after... - You need to go out. For both of our sakes. Trust me. - I lost you at salmon cakes, didn't I? - Yep. Schoolboy error. All right, have a good one. Oh, Luke. Luke. Luke! Luke! Oh, yeah. "Oh, thanks very much, Dad." "You're welcome, son. No problem." Talking to yourself again. First sign of madness. Shame you can't capture these magical moment, hey? Gratitude. I mean... It's heart-warming, isn't it? - How are you? - Oh, I'm good, yeah. You? Yeah, I'm well. You sure? My bloody sister's been gossiping to everyone at the hospital about me and Tom, hasn't she? Well, not everyone. - Cleaner hasn't been told yet. - (LAUGHS) - Morning, Miss. - Morning. - I'm fine, really. - Good. Cos I was wondering, and it's fine if you don't, obviously, and it's too soon... Would you like to... go for a drink some time? - Oh, erm... - No rush. Maybe. Sure, yeah, some time. Of course. When you're ready. (BOTH LAUGH) - Have a good day. - Yeah, you, too. See ya. He's a bloody surgeon who drives a sports car. If you don't lock that down, I will. He's got that single dad, brooding widower thing going on. Doesn't that tick every box? Don't talk to me about boxes. I saw enough of those this morning. - Tom moved out the last of his stuff. - Good! It's been over for ages. You were never a proper couple, not really. You were just old mates that got drunk, had sex and shacked up because you were too polite to admit it was a mistake. - Don't hold back. - (LAUGHS) (BELL RINGS) You must understand, sir, that a person is either with this court or he must be counted against it. There be no road between. This is a sharp time now, a precise time. We live no longer in the dusky afternoon when evil mixed itself with good and befuddled the world. Now, by God's grace, the shining sun is up and them that fear not light will surely praise it. Good. Thank you, Rebecca. So, this statement by Danforth really sums up the attitude of the authorities toward the witch trials. Yes, Luke? Actually, I was just pointing at the light bulb. - (LAUGHTER) - Don't be stupid, Luke. If you're going to point at a light bulb, you point at it like this. (LAUGHTER) Right, OK, let's crack on. So, what modern parallels... (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) - Oh, hello. - I hear wedding bells! Oh, for God's sake. Am I 16 again? I feel like I'm in Dawson's Creek. - Oh, you wish. - I actually do. He's always liked you, you know? Is it possible to divorce your sister? Do you want to die alone? A single woman in this hospital would give both arms and probably throw in a leg for a drink with that man. I broke up with Tom this morning. No, you broke up with him weeks ago. He left this morning. Text Andrew. Do it. Just do it! (SIGHS) OK. OK. Forwarding his number. Do it now or I'll hate you forever. (PHONE BEEPS) _ _ Let it go. Let the weight lift off your shoulders. - (PHONE BEEPS) - Shut out all the noise, Andrew. Just repeat your mantra to yourself. Slowly repeat your mantra. (PHONE BEEPS) I'm just gonna get that. Give it a proper go. You said you'd try with me. I did. I sat down, didn't I? I closed my eyes. If anyone could do with a bit of meditation, it's you. Look, my wife swears by it. Yeah, give me an aortic dissection any day. _ - You might have a point. - Are you decent? - Very rarely. - Patient's ready. I don't even wanna ask. Hey, Katy, don't suppose you've got any advice? Your sister? I assume you know about this. Be nice to her or I'll kill you. (SHOWER RUNS) ♪ This ain't love, it's clear to see ♪ ♪ So, darling, stay with me ♪ (PHONE RINGS) - So, what's the plan? - I said dinner. Do you think that's too much on a first date? No, it's fine. It's a bit more grown up. Anyway, I think he'd like to make a good impression. I think he's nervous. It's all right for some. I'd love to be taken out for a romantic dinner. All I've got to look forward to tonight is bath time and checking for monsters under the bed. Enjoy yourself. Let me know how it goes. Yep, I will. - OK. Bye! - Bye! Yeah, I need a taxi, please. Erm, now. OK, great. Yep, that's me. Thank you. How are you tonight, then, my love? Yeah, good, thanks. Bit nervous, actually. I've got a date and I'm a bit out of practice. Like, really out of practice. (LAUGHS) You know, 30 years ago, I was parked outside a hospital on a yellow line and this traffic warden's writing me out a ticket so I go off at her. I'm effing and blinding. And she stares at me like she's a world poker champion. Well, she just made my blood boil. You know, those people? Yep, I know those people. 30 years of marriage to that woman and she still does it, that poker face. (LAUGHS) I married her four months after she gave me that bloody ticket. (LAUGHS) So you never can tell, see, what's around the corner. Hm! - Here you go. Keep the change. - Oh, thank you. - You have a good one, darling. - I will. Thanks. - Nice to meet you. - You, too. Bye-bye. - Sorry I'm late. - Don't be silly. I couldn't get a taxi. Thank you. Hi. Hi. (BOTH LAUGH) (PHONE CHIMES) (RAIN PATTERS) _ Hello. Morning. Mind if I join? As long as this lot behind me don't lynch you for queue-jumping. - So how was it? - How was what? Don't play coy. How was your big date? (SIGHS) Look, it was good, mate. It was really good. Hey. Oh, you're soaking! - Come in! - No, I don't wanna see the kids. What's the matter? What's going on? Sorry to just come round like this, erm... - Laura, what's happened? - Last night, erm... Andrew, he came to my place for a drink after we'd been out and, erm... I don't, er... I don't remember. I don't... I don't know what he did, Katy. I don't know what he did. Is Auntie Laura OK? Yeah, she's fine. I don't remember most of it. It's just, erm... just flashes and moments here and there. How much... did you have to drink? Er... I don't know. More than I should've done. I was nervous. That's not what this was, though. I remember... I remember kissing him. And then... And then we were on the bed and I think... I think that's when I told him to stop. - You think? - I didn't want to sleep with him, Katy. Did you push him? Did you try and fight him off? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. And, er... how did the evening end? - Always straight to the point. - Well, I'm just asking. I really like her, put it that way. I mean, she's amazing. I know Andrew, I work with him. If he really knew you didn't want to, I... I realise how this sounds, I do, but I... I woke up this morning and I thought, I felt like it was happening to someone else, that it couldn't be real, but it is. It was... It was real, I know it was. - So, are you gonna see her again? - Yeah, I hope so. - I sent her a text. - Already? - No, you don't wanna be too clingy. - Yeah, she hasn't replied. - Well, I'm not surprised. - The minute you send those damn things, time grinds to a halt wondering why they haven't texted back. It's like being a teenager all over again. Thanks for dinner. Oh, to be young again. No thanks. I'm sure you were too well behaved for that sort of thing. What does Luke call it? PDA? Er, do you know, I didn't get much opportunity. No? I was more interested in chocolate than boys when I was younger. It's still a close run thing. - What about you? - What about me? What were you like when you were at school? Ah, pretty much perfect in every way. Ah. So you became an arrogant sod later. Yes, that came later. (BOTH LAUGH) Hello. - Hi. Is it Laura? And you're Katy. Come in. So if we go down here, we've got a room on the right. It's a bit warmer. Now, here's Julia. She's our forensic examiner today. Erm, so this is Laura and this is Laura's sister. OK. Thank you very much. I'm gonna prepare the room now for examination. I'll let you know when I'm ready. OK. I'll be with you in a moment, all right? So, we would like to collect your underwear, your trousers and your top stuff, but not your coat or your shoes. And we'll provide you with replacements. If you could drop those clothes onto that for me. We're just behind the curtains, all right? - OK. - OK? OK. So Julia's gonna pick up all of those clothes. Take a little seat on there for me, please. Now, after the examination and the drug test, we can call the police, we can do the report right here. - Yeah, that would be good, thanks. - OK. OK, so I'm just gonna slip your arm out here. OK, if you just hold it underneath, then you can still cover yourself up a bit. OK. OK. This is me. Thanks for walking me home. - I had a really good night. - Me, too. Good night. I really hope we can do this again some time. - Yeah, I'd really like that. - Yeah, me, too. - Good night. - Night. Oh, bollocks. I was gonna call a cab but my battery's died. Oh, smooth. - Oh, no, it's not a line, I swear. - (LAUGHS) - It just knows when I need it the most. - I can call you one from inside. No, it's fine, I'll walk, honestly. Don't be silly! It's freezing. Come on. Come inside. Appreciate it. It's just upstairs. - All right. - Thanks. Thanks. (SOBS) I'll tell the police what happened and then I don't wanna talk about it any more, OK? (PHONE BUZZES) You should go back to work. No, I'm... I've already told them I'm not coming in. I was... I was supposed to be in theatre today... with him. - Take a nice soft seat. - Thank you. OK? And I'll go and get the police officers now. Are you ready? Yeah. If you just come down. She's just having a cup of tea. Is she by herself? Anyone with her? - Her sister. - OK. All right, love. So these are the police officers today and they will tell you who they are and what the plan is for today, all right? Thank you. Hi, Miss Neilson. I'm Detective Vanessa Harmon. - This is my colleague, Rory Maxwell. - Hello. So, we've come to talk to you about what's happened to you. BP's 90 over 55. Pulse is steady. OK. Let's close him up. Thanks for stepping in today. Anyone heard from Katy yet? No, nothing. Mr Earlham, the police are here to see you. I think we're all done here. Do you mind closing up? - Hello. - Mr Earlham. - DI Harmon. - And I'm DS Maxwell. I've got another procedure in 15 minutes. What's this about? We're from the sexual offences investigation team. I'm arresting you for rape. You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court. Anything you say may be given in evidence. Do you understand? Rape? Arrest? What are you talking about? If you'd like to come with us, sir. (CHUCKLES) I think there's been a mistake. Can I come and see you... We can cuff you if you want or you can come along nicely. Up to you. Erm... - (SIGHS) Can I get changed at least? - Of course. We'll wait. I hate hospitals. Times like this... I wish Mum was still here. She'd know what to say. There's nothing to say. Come on. Let's get you inside. Got some nice pictures there, haven't you? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, look, Mummy's back. Can you say hello? - Hello, Mummy! - Hello. Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Hiya. Good? - Yeah, yeah. - Shouldn't you two be at work? - I'm not feeling well. I said she's better off staying here where we can look after her. Go upstairs and I'll bring you some water, OK? Show Mummy what you've just drawn. - Hey! Yeah, lovely! - ♪ Once I was 20 years old... ♪ - Ah, phone! - ♪ My story got told ♪ Oh, Jesus. When are you gonna change that ringtone? As soon as that song stops being so awesome. (LAUGHS) ♪ 20 years old ♪ I love this song. You and my brother-in-law would get on well, then. ♪ Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold ♪ I don't know what's taking them so long. ♪ We've traveled around the world... ♪ This is bloody stupid. Hi. - (LAUGHS) - Hi. Yeah. Erm, I'd like a taxi, please. (LAUGHS) 40 minutes? Er, yeah, that's fine. OK. Yep, that's me. Great. Thanks. Bye. Well, we might as well get a drink, then. If you're sure. It is a school night. It's quite literally a school night for you, isn't it? I won't tell if you won't. - Wine's in the kitchen. - Well, then, allow me. - Oh, can I open this? - I don't know, can you? Ha-ha-ha. I'll bring it right over. I could get used to this, waiter service. Well, this is taking far too long. It's unacceptable. I couldn't find the glasses. Sorry. Sorry. I just wanted to get your key. I was gonna go round and get you a bag of clothes and stuff. Yeah, OK. You can stay with us for as long as you want. Thank you. Will you be OK? I'm fine. Well, Liam is downstairs and I'll be as quick as I can. OK. (PHONE BUZZES) Will you stop calling me? I'm in the middle of... No, I'm just saying it's not a good time. I don't know when, OK? Just... leave me alone. (DISTANT SIREN) Excuse me, I'm afraid you can't be in here right now. Er, this is my sister's flat. I'm just here to collect some clothes for her. Sorry, you have to wait until we're completely finished. If you can wait outside. - OK. - Thank you. The taxi was taking even longer than we thought so I asked if I could charge my mobile. She said OK. And did Miss Neilson take the phone from you at that point? No. No, she said the charger was in the bedroom. So I followed her. And when I was in there... we started kissing. Did you kiss her first? Er... Erm... Yeah, I think so. Yes, yes, I did. Erm, and then she... kissed me back. - And then... - Mm-hm? Christ. What else do you want me to say? Well, what happened after you started kissing? (SIGHS) This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna talk about that. - She said you raped her. - No! No, I didn't! We laid down on the bed, OK? Do you really need me to spell it out? - Were you on top of her as you laid down? - Yes. - Did you push her down? - No! God, no! - She had her arm around me. - Did she ask you to stop? No, never! Look... I took off her clothes... ..and she helped me take off mine. We never said anything. We were just in the moment, you know? And then, er... Then I didn't have a... - A condom. - Yes. Christ. (SIGHS) And she said that I could use one from her bathroom, so I got up and went over to the cabinet to get one. And all that time, she didn't... ..she didn't get up or walk away or say, "Stop, I don't want this." Not once. You have to believe me. If I thought for one second she didn't wanna sleep with me, I would never have done it. I don't know why she'd say something like this. All I know is I had a wonderful night with a woman I thought I'd be seeing again. I sent her a text, for God's sake. We've pulled the details from your phone. Well, there you are. Then you've read it. "What an amazing night." Why on earth would I send a text like that if I'd... (SIGHS) If I did what you're saying... ..why would I do that? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Andrew, you're being released on police bail. Sorry this took so long. Sign there. So, here's my card. Call me if you need anything. In the meantime, get some sleep and... - we'll speak in the morning. - OK. I'll show you out. Oh. Sorry. Excuse me. - Sit down. - Keys, keys, keys. - Erm... by the bowl. - Oh. - Next to the fridge. - Hey! Give me that! Er, no! OK, so, Riddle's off sick so I'm gonna be late tonight. - Again? - Yeah, sorry. - I'd trade you if I could. - Really? Cos you can be my guest. No, you have to eat your fruit! Come on! Olly, Max, listen to Daddy, please. You gonna tell me what's going on with Laura? - I already told you. - You said the break-up. I'm not buying it. Her and Tom have been over for ages. OK. OK. Something happened. But don't say anything. - Dad? - Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. (SIGHS) She went out the other night with Andrew Earlham, he's a surgeon at my hospital. Right. She says he raped her. I know. It's... It's awful. Do the police know... what happened last time? Why should they? - Right, who wants toast faces? - Me! - Yay! Hands up. Hands up. - Morning. Right, I'm off. Want me to fix you breakfast? - I'm OK, thanks. - You're going to work? This is a bad idea. I'm not gonna let this control me, Katy. Sorry. Sorry. Late getting started this morning. What time did you get back last night? - I... had a surgery that went on. - Ah, figured. Sorry. I should've called. - It's fine. - No. No. It's not fine. I should've called you. You were here on your own and I should've... - Dad, are you OK? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Just, erm... just... just a late night, that's all. - Actually, Luke... - Dad, it's ten to! Whoa! Are you sure you can drive without coffee? Ha-ha-ha. I'm not that bad. Just don't fall asleep at the wheel, yeah? (QUIET CHATTER) Here she is. What happened to you yesterday? I tried calling. I wasn't feeling well. So, I'm dying to know, how was the date? You know, I'd rather not talk about it, if that's OK. Sure. Are you all right? I'm fine. I will be. (CHAOTIC SHOUTING) Luke! Get down off there right now! 'Tis the Iron Throne. Westeros will fall if I denounce the throne, miss. I'm serious, Luke. Get down now! - I was just... - Just what? I've had enough! That's school property! Go and see the head! - Seriously? - Go! Now! If you put the same effort into school work as you do into pissing about, you might stand a chance of passing next year! What are you looking at? Put this room back together now! Get your books out! - I do have a photograph. - Yes! Come on. Come on. Out with it. Out with it. - She's gonna kill me if I... - Come on! Got it. Right, so, this is me and Katy when I was 11 and she was 13. (LAUGHS) She had an overbite of about three metres. (LAUGHS) What did she do? I think our parents made her orthodontist a very rich man that year. It's nice that you two are so close. I mean, she talks about you all the time. Non-stop. She talks about everyone non-stop. No, no, no. But you in particular. In a nice way. I feel like I know everything about you. Well... that's not fair. I, erm... I hardly know anything about you. Apart from the fact you give a good parents' evening. - Do I? - Yeah. Trust me. What are you doing here? You're not allowed to be anywhere near me. I just wanna talk. Luke told me you sent him to the headmaster. - Get out! - I know he's a handful, I do, but... please don't take whatever this is out on him. Whatever this is? (SIGHS) - You really think I forced you? - I know what happened! Yeah, me, too! Look, Laura, I'm sorry if things moved faster than you intended. - If I'd known you wanted me to stop... - I said no! No, you didn't. You might have meant to, Laura, but you didn't. You never did. I did. Look, we're just seeing this completely differently, that's all. - It's just an awful misunderstanding. - Get out. - That's not the right word obviously. - Get out. - Look, Laura, please. - Get out. - They arrested me... - Get out! (SIGHS) Oh, God. I'm sorry. - (SOBS) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. This was a bad idea. I'm sorry. (SOBS) - Tom, it's me. - You all right? Erm... Sorry. Sorry to call. I need to... see you. I need to talk to you. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Thanks. OK. I'll see you later. (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) - Sorry. I wasn't gonna call you. - I'm glad you did. Don't look at me like that. - Like what? - Like I'm a victim. Look, I didn't call you for sympathy. I just wanted to hear it straight from someone who knows. Do you think the police will do something? Of course they will. He was convincing today. He looked me straight in the eye, with no-one else around, and he swore blind that I had it all wrong. He practically had me believing it. The law is on your side. Even though I can't prove it? It's my word against his. - I invited him in. - That doesn't matter. How do I know they'll believe me? If they find out about my background, that I was on medication... Don't. Don't think like that. It's gonna be OK. Thanks. I'm sorry for bothering you. - Let me give you a lift home. - No, I'm fine. - Laura, please, come on. - I said I'm fine! (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) I didn't think you were coming. I wasn't going to. What happened to Laura, it's awful. And I know you need to be there for her. I understand that. I can wait. As long as you need. But I'm not ready to just let what we have go away. - I love you, Katy. - Stop it! We were a stupid mistake. That's all. If Laura ever found out, Christ, Tom, if she knew about us... You're not the reason Laura and I broke up, you know. I'm supposed to be helping her! She's my little sister and right now she needs me and I can't do anything. You're doing what you can. You remember what happened, don't you? Are you sure it happened exactly like she said it did? Why would she lie about something like this? Andrew needs to go away for what he's done to her. You need to look into Andrew Earlham. Find out everything you can about him. There are detectives on it, people who do this day in, day out. It's not my job. Please! All right, I'll... I'll do whatever I can. I promise. Listen to me. I don't care how long I have to wait. We're a mistake, Tom! I can't do this. I'm sorry. Sorry to disturb you, Miss Neilson. Your sister said you were staying here when we interviewed her. Why don't we take a seat and we can talk? So, how are you doing? Have you arrested him? He's been released on police bail. Mr Earlham has a different version of events. - I'm sure he does. - He said it was consensual. I said no. I asked him to stop. Miss Neilson, all we're trying to do here is make sure we have all the facts. We didn't find any... cuts or bruises on Mr Earlham. Or you. The drug test was negative. There was no genital injury. There was no... So how badly exactly does he have to hurt me before you call it rape? People in the bar where you met said you were getting on well. CCTV shows you walking home laughing. That was before. Mr Earlham says when he went to get a condom that you didn't move from the bed. Did you try to get away at that point? I don't remember. I was in shock. I couldn't move. Erm... - I'm not making this up. - No, no, no. Nobody's saying you are. We're just... We're asking these questions because we have to. - Mm-hm. - Because it's what his lawyer will ask. It all happened in a blur. He was... He was on top of me and... and I wanted to push him off, but I was so... ..I was so shocked, I couldn't... I couldn't move. Maybe he went into the bathroom. I don't know. I can't... I can't remember. How much don't you remember? How much... ..exactly did you have to drink? No, no, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. You're making it out... I don't mean... No. I... I wasn't drunk. I remember coming into the bedroom. I remember him pushing me down. And I remember, I remember clear as anything, I told him to stop. Yeah. You know, I don't think I wanna talk about this any more today, actually. All right, let's just leave it there for now. I'm afraid we will have to go through this in a bit more detail. I'll give you a call and figure out a time. Sorry to have disturbed you. We'll show ourselves out. Thank you. (SIREN WAILS) _ Hi, is that Edinburgh Coroner's Office? My name's Tom Bailey. I'm a constable with the Thanet and Dover Police. I'm just trying to find out about an old case. Mary Earlham. Wife of Andrew Earlham. A suicide back in 2006. (DOOR SHUTS) - He swapped the glasses. - How do you know? Because I remember now. We came in, he poured the wine while I sat down, then I got up and I grabbed a glass. We talked. Then I went into the other room to get a photograph. But it was his idea. He told me to go and get it. And when I came back, he was drinking from my glass. I left a lipstick stain. Maybe it was an accident. I left mine at the other side of the table. And when I went back this morning, both glasses were in the dishwasher. Nothing else inside. And I didn't put them there. Jesus, Laura! Are you saying he drugged you? Why else would he have swapped the glasses? That's why I couldn't try any harder to fight him off. That's why I just lay there while he went to the bathroom. That's why the whole night felt like a blur. The blood tests from the clinic didn't show anything. I looked it up and GHB in the right quantities... Is gone from the bloodstream in 12 hours. So... He's a doctor. He knew exactly what he was doing, how much to give me. Not that it makes any difference. They'll look at my medical history, Katy, and... ..they'll call me a mad woman. A hysterical, mad woman telling lies about the hero surgeon. You don't know that. All people will see is that I invited him in, I poured him a drink, and somehow that means I wanted it. You can't let yourself think that way. Doesn't matter anyway. I'm gonna make sure that everyone knows exactly who he is. What does that mean? Laura. Laura! _ _ Laura, whatever you're planning, I'm asking you, don't do it. Don't do anything to jeopardise the case. Too late. It's already done. I posted it on his profile page. Now every colleague, every friend, every member of his family... - Morning. - ..now they know.
