 You and Tom? Please, don't. Get off me, Katy. I'd do anything for you. Even when you're angry at me. We have a warrant to search your premises. We have to impound your car. Thanks to you, I've got police officers searching my house. I'm suspended until they put me in front of a disciplinary board. Can you explain how Earlham's car keys were in your home? Someone put it there. When I was at the hospital, I saw your son. I couldn't follow them, but, erm,

 I heard the doctor say he tried to kill himself. My boy. Lying in that bed. It was her. She did this to him. If she hadn't opened her bitch mouth. Tell me, when did you last see Earlham? You know when I last saw him. I told the police. A couple of days after he went missing, huh? Sale loft, I read the report. The release of Laura Nielson seems to suggest that Thanet And Dover Police have a new prime suspect in their sights. A lot of people are looking for you. But I know what you did to my wife.

 I'm sick of these games, Laura. SHE GASPS How are we? Thank you. Good morning, Laura! Ms Nielson, over here, please! Do you have any comment on Andrew Earlham's murder? Can we get a statement, please? Come on, give us something, Laura. I've got nothing to say. Laura! SCHOOL BELL RINGS Laura? Why are they here? Why do you think? Look, I was gonna call this morning. I assumed... I just assumed you wouldn't come in. I just want to carry on as normal. Try and keep my head down. It's just... PHONE BUZZES Look in... In light of all this, we think it would be better if you took a bit of time off. Just until things settle. Paid, of course. It'll make things... easier. Mr Balham? For who? Sorry. Look, I'm sorry. What are you doing here? Excuse me. Hello, Laura, everything all right? This is my life. Yeah, we're just asking a few questions. I've already lost my boyfriend because of your questions. Oh, he's gone? Ah, that's a shame. I liked him. This could cost me my job. A job I like and that I'm good at. It's about all I've got right now. Well then, why don't you save us all a lot of time and bother and just tell me what happened? Do you carry on like this in all your cases? Well, my boss doesn't love it, but she does love my conviction record, so... yeah. It seems to me that there were a lot of people that wanted Andrew Earlham dead. Yet you're spending all of your time on me. Mm-hm. Hmm. You know, before I became a detective, I thought it was just gonna be like it was on telly. Turns out it's 95% checking phone records, bank statements and waiting for people to screw up. And do you wanna know what the other 5% is? Not particularly. Instinct. Still matters. Still counts. And my instinct tells me you did this. Well, good luck making that stand up in court. Winnie, hi. I'm sorry, I know you're... I know this is a rubbish time for you. You have no idea. It's fine. Are you OK? I need to see you. What is it? What's happened? Bigger? How you doing? Let's get you going. Mummy, what's wrong with him? Shh. Why? He looks funny. Max, it's rude to talk about people like that. But it's true. He looks different, not funny. Just because you think something, doesn't mean you have to say it. You mean a lie. No. There's... I'm saying sometimes you don't have to say everything you think. But saying something not true means a lie. Think of it as a good lie. How do I know if it's a good lie or bad lie? Look at me and if it's a good lie, I'll nod. OK? OK. Come on, then. Ready? Hold on. Oo-o-h we-e-e! Hello? Yeah, yeah. Is it really fun? Serious, again? No, it's fine, I can be there, don't worry. Just tell her I'll be there now, OK? All right, bye-bye. Right, we gotta go. Look, Aunty Sue's had another fall, she needs to go to A&E.; Come on, mate. Oh, no. Go, go, go. I'll, erm... I'll take the kids to mine. No, listen, I... I don't think that's a good idea. Do you? They're my children, Liam. You can trust me. OK. Come here. Listen, mate, come here. You gonna be good for Mummy? Yeah! Promise? Promise. Yeah. Ah, what's that? Argh! All right. Thank you. See you later, all right, mate? Listen, scooter's over there, all right? I'll call you as soon as I know what's going on. OK, yep. All right. Aw, got my boys. SHE CHUCKLES Winnie. Hey. Oh, my God. Yeah. It went up in the middle of the night. Someone saw the blaze and called the fire brigade. How's Carl? Well, that's just it, erm... when my phone rang, I thought he must be down here already. Only... he's gone. I've been calling and calling and can't get through. He's disappeared? The police are saying it was arson. That someone did this deliberately. And they think it was Carl? Do you think you could help me try and find him? I get it if you can't. I just... I've got a feeling something's very wrong. He went out last night and didn't come home. And now he tries to burn this place down, the thing he loves more than anything. It's just that he's been so different since Andrew Earlham died. He hasn't been to bed with me in weeks. And one night I remember, I... I woke up and he already had the washing machine on. He was washing his clothes in the middle of the night. OK. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on. I know all his passwords, I thought we didn't have any secrets. So this is his mobile account. Right, first step, let's see who he's been talking to. There's a lot of calls to and from this number. Is that you? No. Here's the most recent, he made it this morning, about an hour ago. Do you recognise the number? Who recognises any numbers these days? Let's take a look further back. Here. Same number. Three weeks ago, Carl called them at... 5:00AM for ten minutes. Weird time to make a call, don't you think? Just a bit. Who the hell is it? Let's ring them and ask. Hi. Hi, Jen. Thanks for seeing us. Come in. I don't know, I don't remember every call I receive. Even at five in the morning? Isn't it the police that are supposed to interrogate you? The police let a serial rapist walk free, so you'll forgive me if I don't really trust them. Me and Carl met at a PTSD group. When you meet people who serve, it's like family, you know? Then, the news about Andrew came out. And we realised we both had wives who... We talked. A lot. Jen. Did Carl ever talk to you about hurting Andrew? If you really think your husband did that, then you need to speak to him. Cos I can't help you. Well, I would. But he's disappeared. And the last person he called today was you. He didn't say anything? About his boatyard, or wanting to get out of...? No, he didn't. Look, I've done you the courtesy of speaking to you, but I really need to get on, OK? Thanks. Sorry for disturbing you. She's lying. You think (?) Question is, why? HE SIGHS A lot of people are looking for you, Andrew Earlham. Do I know you? No. But I know you. And I know what you did to my wife. Winnie Peterson. So, what now? You're not even gonna deny it? Would it help if I did? Stay where you are. I bet you've pictured this, haven't you? Living out some revenge... Shut up! What is it you want? I want you to think about my wife, you piece of shit. I want you to think about her and all the other women you hurt as your lungs fill up with water and your world turns black. Now, turn... around. HE GRUNTS HE STRAINS Come here, you slippery bastard! Don't do this. Call the police. Just tell them where I am. You don't want this on your head. You can't! You can't just kill me. You're wrong about that. HE GROANS RADIO: As I just said, we have a number of promising leads and we expect to make an arrest in the next few days. Thank you very much for your time, ladies and gentlemen. RADIO: DI Karen Renton there from earlier this week, assuring the public that the Met is closing in on Andrew Earlham's killer. So when's the disciplinary hearing? Next week. I'm shopping for baby clothes to try to avoid thinking about it. But all that happens is I'm looking at these prices and I'm wondering if I'm gonna be able to afford anything if I don't have a job. So what's going on? You didn't give much away on the phone. I've just come from seeing your other half. Why? A friend of hers that she met at a PTSD group, Carl Peterson, has disappeared. The last person he called was Jennifer. There've been a lot of calls between them. One at five in the morning. So? So Carl's wife thinks that he might have been involved in Andrew's murder, and that Jennifer was helping him in some way. You're serious? I just spoke to Jennifer. I think she's hiding something. All I'm asking is that you talk to her. You're desperate, OK, I get that. But I don't need this. If Jennifer knows something, she could help me. Knows what? Laura, I've been a detective for 15 years. Don't you think I'd notice if my wife was involved in something like this? Look, I know how this sounds. And you're right, I am desperate. But all I know is Carl trusted her, now he's gone and the last phone call he made wasn't to his wife, it was to yours. Just think about it. I've gotta go. DOOR CLOSES Night-night, loves. Sleep tight. Sleep tight. DOOR CLOSES Evening. Evening. How's the job hunt? Slow. Depressing. The usual. I brought a few things, might cheer you up. Right! So, er, gender-neutral, then? I like pink. That's all right, isn't it? Yeah, course. Will you just give that a stir for me? I just wanna just sit down. Yeah. How's your day been? All right. Oh, wow, this smells amazing. What is it? What are you doing? I could ask you the same thing. Thanks for coming, I, erm... HE PANTS I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to call. All right, Carl. Just... Just calm down. What is it that you couldn't tell me on the phone? RECORDING: Hi, this is Laura, leave me a message and I'll get back to you. VANESSA: Laura, hi. You should know, I've spoken to Jennifer and she's told me everything. Carl Peterson told her he did it. We're gonna go to the police station this morning. What are you doing here? Before you go in, I wanted to talk to you both. Look for what it's worth... if the police hadn't let you go, I would have spoken up. I wouldn't have let you go away for this. Look I... I need to know exactly what happened. Not now. We should go and talk to them, come on... Please, I need to know! Andrew was hiding out on a boat. Carl found him. Overpowered him. Sailed him out to sea. Threw him overboard and drowned the bastard. When he came ashore, he panicked. And he called me. Please, let's rethink this. Look, maybe if I just... If I turn myself in, if I just explain... No. It's not what you want. You could've called the police yourself, but you didn't. No, cos I trust you and your missus, she'd see me right, Vanessa, yeah? Vanessa can bring me in. If you don't get rid of this evidence, you are going down for life. And you know you don't deserve to go to prison for this. I doesn't matter, Jen, I can't live with this. I can't just come back to work tomorrow, like nothing's happened. What, wake up next to Winnie and just pretend? Well then, you're gonna have to try, aren't ya? Like Vanessa has to pretend that she's OK, that she doesn't think about it non-bloody-stop. She's never going to be OK and nor is Winnie. Because of him. We know how this shit goes, Carl. We've seen it, haven't we? It's what we talk about in group every week. This stuff doesn't go away. I can't. You tell the police what you want. But you'll go down for it. And as far as I'm concerned, you're a hero. I persuaded him to cover the boat and keep his mouth shut. Did Carl tell you he was trying to set me up? No. I'm not saying he didn't. But he didn't say anything to me. What about the car key? She doesn't know anything about that. Really? Really. All right, that's enough. Come on, let's go and tell them what happened. Do you know where Carl is? I need to speak to him. He's staying at a place of my uncle's. I'll text you the address. Jen. Listen, I know this sounds odd, but... do you think you could hold off. Hold off on speaking to the police? Why? Rory didn't tell you anything about the case, did he? No. There's something you need to know. It's about WHEN Andrew died. Hey. Hey. I know where Carl is. Jennifer's got an uncle with a place in the woods. She said he could hide out there. What? What...? Is he OK? I'll tell you everything on the way. OK. HE BREATHES DEEPLY HE COCKS GUN GUNSHOT Yeah, Liam, it's fine. Whenever you need, yeah. OK. All right, then. Yeah. Cheers, bye-bye. Hey! Toast is for eating, not for throwing, thanks, boys. KNOCK ON DOOR We're gonna have another Mummy day today? Yeah! Yeah! DI Maxwell. I met you once before, when we came to talk to your sister. OK. Can I come in? Erm, is this official? Just a chat. What do you think? Sure. Kids! Eat up, OK, we're leaving in five minutes. OK. Five minutes. You're on the Twelve Steps? I'm thinking about it. Good for you. Are you? No, a... friend of mine is. It's a good thing. As long as you stick at it. Thank you. I want to ask you about your sister's behaviour, after Andrew Earlham went on the run. Her behaviour? What do you mean? Would it be fair to say she wasn't herself? No shit. She was being stalked by Andrew Earlham. Afraid for her life. Yeah. She was afraid for her life. Did she ever talk about what she'd do... if she saw him again? She wouldn't do it, Detective. She couldn't. I know my sister. You don't know where she was though, do you, six days ago? First thing in the morning. I... I need to get my children ready, erm... Did you say six days ago? Yeah? Oh, she was at home. Yes. Alone, as she's stated multiple times. There was no-one there to confirm her alibi. No, no, I mean, I saw her. I popped round there before I dropped the kids off, erm, and when I arrived... Things haven't been great between us. And so when I saw her through the window, I couldn't... I couldn't face just turning up out of the blue. Mrs Sutcliffe, you love your sister. I get it. But you need to think very carefully before involving yourself. Well, the kids were there. They saw her, too. They'll tell you. Erm, Maxie, darling, come here. Erm, do you remember a few days ago we went over to Aunty Laura's house and we looked through the window and saw her, but we left before... we knocked? Do you remember that? Yes, Mummy. I see. And you didn't think to provide us with that information? Well, no-one came round. No-one asked me. Look, erm, if... If that's all, I really need to get going. And you'd be willing to say all of that in an official statement? Yeah. Yeah, I would. Right. We'll be in touch. I just want to talk. You owe me that. You owe me a bloody conversation. OK, then. Right. Tomorrow morning. Yeah, good, we can sit down and discuss it. Greg? Everything all right? Just wonderful. Anything yet from Laura's car? Nothing of note. Probably wasn't worth the wait. She obviously doesn't drive it very much, it had a flat battery. Seems more than just an ordinary case for you. The way that you're going after Laura. Right. Just making conversation. My ex, Anthony, he used to hit me. Five years, and every time I'd make an excuse. He was tired, he was stressed, he won't do it again. And then one day, I had an epiphany. It was never gonna stop. And that night, my head was so bruised I couldn't put it on the pillow. So I just watched him fast asleep, like always, snoring like a pig. So I went downstairs and I got a kitchen knife and I stood above him and I thought, "Yes, this would be so easy." He'd be gone and I'd be free. Instead, I reported him and I put his arse in prison. I hate what Andrew Earlham did and it's hard keeping faith in the legal system when people like him walk free. But that doesn't mean it's all right to kill him and expect to walk away. There you go. Oh, hello! An antique. That's an old sat nav. Probably doesn't work, but plug it in anyway. Yes ma'am. Jennifer said it's just down here. HE BREATHES HEAVILY HE BANGS ON THE DOOR What are you doing here? Where've you been? Out. What's going on? Are the kids OK? They're fine. They're with my mum. Can we talk inside? Sure. Tea? So, this... This hole that you keep digging for yourself, Katy, it's becoming ridiculous now, isn't it? What? Oh, come on! You know what. At least have the decency not to lie to me. Please, come on, at least you can give me that. I just spoke to DS Maxwell. They are children, Katy. Our children. They told me what happened. Like it was some kind of fun story for them. "Oh, Mummy asked us to lie today. "But don't worry, Daddy, it was a good lie, so it's OK". Do you know what. If you wanna go around making up alibis and lying in court, you go ahead and do that, I can't stop you. But don't you dare use our children! I just thought if I could help Laura... I might get my sister back. I just wanted to fix something for once. Yeah. Do you know what? You have a problem. And you really need to listen to me when I say this to you. Me and my boys are not gonna become a part of your problem. DOOR CLOSES SHE SOBS What will you say to him? I don't know. I just wish he'd talk to me. Tell you one thing, if Carl is the one who's been setting you up, I'll bloody kill him myself. This is it. Carl? Carl? Oh, Carl! No. Carl! Oh, Carl! Oh, Carl! HE SOBS I'm so sorry. How could you? You don't understand what I've done. No, you don't understand, you stupid, stupid man. Laura, will you tell him? There's something you need to know. If I tell you this, if I tell you the truth, I need you to do the same. Don't look at her, look at me. You didn't kill Andrew Earlham. No. I tied his arms and... And threw him into the sea. The police have his time of death at six days ago, not three weeks. Really! What? I saw him. After you threw him off the boat. I promise you, I promise you, you didn't kill him. HE SOBS God! HE PANTS HE SOBS I need you to answer me one question. Yeah. Did you plant that key in my house? Did you try and frame me? No, honestly, I've got no idea what you're on about. I need you to tell me what happened. Beginning to end. I saw him. I saw Andrew one night coming off of a boat. He was talking to some guy in a blue cap and... Who? I dunno. I couldn't make out his face, he... He was too far away. So that night on his boat. I waited for him. And I sailed him out to sea. What kind of man am I, Winnie? Andrew's gone. But you're here. And so am I. None of this makes any sense. I just don't understand how he could've survived that. Well, he did. All right. OK. Watch the recording. She might say she doesn't remember, but you can see for yourself. She knew exactly what was going on. HE GRUNTS "Aw, thanks so much, Dad." "You're welcome, son!" Talking to yourself again? First sign of madness. You probably don't need to hear it, but love you, mate. Yeah, love you, too. Go for a drink sometime? Erm, yep. Maybe. Sure. Erm, yeah, sometime. Her word against mine. She did this to me. Sorry, mate! Hi. It's not over. I have to win, no matter what. I'm the same. HE GASPS HE PANTS HE COUGHS Creature of habit, aren't you, Laura? I'm the same, mind. I like my routine. I did, anyway... Why are you here? ..before you came along! Why do you think I'm here? After what you've done to my son! No! Get off me! Sh! Sh-h-h! I didn't come here to hurt you, so don't make me, OK? All right? What do you want from me? Don't you think it's about time that you and I just talked? Without all the drama. You shouldn't have come here. Everyone's looking for you. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you've seen to that, haven't you? You've lost, Andrew. This act, this carefully cultivated bullshit that you're actually human, it's over. Everyone knows. Your colleagues, your friends, your son. Don't you dare. You're the reason he tried to kill himself! What do you want from me? There's this idea, isn't there? That just before you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes. The things you care about, things you've achieved. The battles you've won. I just experienced that beautiful moment. Except it wasn't beautiful, Laura. Because all I could see was your face. And the fact that if it wasn't for you, my son wouldn't be lying half dead in the hospital right now. You did that, Laura. YOU did. Well, what are you gonna do about it? You stole my life. Now I'm gonna steal yours. ON PHONE: Emergency. Which service do you require? Police. Take care. PHONE RINGS Liam, hi. What? DOOR BELL RINGS Hi. Liam called me, he told me what you did. Great! You gonna shout at me, too? I have enough to deal with being arrested for murder, Katy! They found a car key in my flat, I have no idea how it got there. Then, Carl tells me there was some guy helping Andrew, he has no idea what he looked like and then you go and do this. Believe it or not, I was actually trying to help. Why would you even do it, anyway? Unless you think I'm guilty? Oh, don't be stupid, Laura. That's it, isn't it? No! Laura! When Andrew found me at the marshes, he told me he was going to steal my life. That's exactly what he's doing. And all you're doing is helping him. Stop. Please, just stop! Laura. Laura. Don't go. SHE SIGHS Oh. I was wondering if you'd come back. I just needed some time. And? You lied. I keep coming back to it. Yeah, like you lied to the police, so you could help out Laura. That's different. You lied to me. We're supposed to be able to tell each other anything, everything. I wanna tell you it won't happen again. But I can't. People lie, Ness, to protect the ones they love all the time. About killing someone? Look, I told you when Carl called me, I thought it was too late. What's the point in letting that man go to prison... Stop. Just stop, OK, you're making excuses. Stop! What would you've done? If you'd have seen Andrew and you'd had the chance. The fact you would ask me that question terrifies the shit out of me. Do you know me at all? Yeah. Yeah, I do. And I knew you'd look at me just like that when you found out. But you did it anyway. I mean, why didn't you wake me up? Why didn't you tell me what Carl had said? Just... tell me what I can do. Tell me what I can say. Ness? Are we gonna be OK? I don't know. Are you really telling me that if you knew who killed Andrew, if you knew who put that evil bastard in the ground, you'd send them to prison? It's not up to me and it's not up to you, either. Come on, Laura, just a few words. How do you feel about the messages on social media calling you a hero? Laura, give us a statement, Laura. You want a statement? Yes! All right. Andrew Earlham assaulted 19 women, including me. 19 that we know of. He recorded the awful things he did, so he could watch his victims over and over again. The police have proof that he was a psychopath. But you're wasting your time out here. There's a long list of people who had reason to kill him. I did not murder Andrew Earlham. If you didn't, then who did? Who was it? Who did it then, Laura? Laura! Was it Ian Davis? Laura! INDISTINCT SHOUTING Call them, then! I said I'd fucking do it, OK. No good saying you'll do this and do that. What, do you want me to do it right now? You're still in the same position, yes, why not? Go on, call them. You owe it to yourself, Greg. You owe it to me! You know that. Sorry to interrupt. Yeah, erm, what is it? See ya, Dad. Greg! Ma'am. Look like you slept in those clothes. We've got something. Laura's sat nav, SOCO pulled the data. This is the last address that she entered, right before Earlham died. Where the hell's that? Let's find out. Get your coat, you've pulled. SIRENS BLARE DOGS BARK My God. Get SOCO here now.
