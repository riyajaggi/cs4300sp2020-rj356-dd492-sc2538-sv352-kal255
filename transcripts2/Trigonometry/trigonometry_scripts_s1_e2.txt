 (GROANING) -Hey. -I feel 100 years old. -Hey. -KIERAN: Hi. Good morning. GEMMA: Hi. How did you sleep? Look, I think maybe I overshared a bit last night. That's okay, we all did. Er, I'm not used to drinking and I got a bit carried away, being out in London and everything, and when we got back, I just... undoing my dress. I'm so embarrassed. - No, that was... That wasn't weird. - I mean, why would it be?

 I get changed in front of people all the time. I don't have boundaries about that sort of thing. GEMMA: I'm cool, we're both totally cool with everything. I just don't want you to think I'm that kind of person. No, we don't think you're... Wait. What kind of person? Neither are we. Anyway. Bathroom is free. I am going to be late. -Great. -Moi is going to kill me. What? Nothing. (MOBILE RINGING) -You should be asleep. -KIERAN: Went for a run. You're working nights. You need to sleep. Do we need to talk? About what happened last night?

 -Nothing happened last night. -Yeah, I know, but... Do we need to talk about the thing that... didn't happen? Nothing didn't happen. Kieran? Okay. Yeah, I've got to go. (CLEARS THROAT) -You ready? -Yeah... DIRECTOR: Position one. Can we get them on set, please? (DIRECTOR SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MOIRA: How did it look? Yeah. You okay? Don't worry, it's going to be fine. (SIGHS) DIRECTOR: Position one. Whenever the talent is ready please. GEMMA: Oh, God. - ASHER: What, we're not expecting - any customers or anything? Mind it doesn't get in your eyes. Hang on... What are you looking for? -I thought... Hang on. -What? DIRECTOR: Get your feet in the straps. Nice and relaxed. Are you happy? Yeah, excellent. Three, two, one. Regulator out. And action... GEMMA: Wow. WALTER: Gemma? Hi, Dad. (WHIMPERING) (BELL RINGING) MOIRA: Ray. I am coming. I am coming. (COUGHING) Let me through. Let me through. You're okay. I've got you. I've got you. I've got you. (GASPING) MARINA: Can someone help me? Help! GEMMA: Nick's got no right calling you up... He's concerned for you. We all are. -I'm fine. -NAIMA: Victor, what are you doing? GEMMA: Victor, can you... be more careful? Please. -What are your outgoings? -Don't. - -Let me look at your books. I could... - -I'm not getting it wrong, Dad. I'm doing everything that I can. You should have stayed at that place in Mayfair. - Asher? Asher, can you take that out the front? - Not through the kitchen. Please. -Sorry, Gemma. -WALTER: Chef. -Huh? -You say "Chef." - You don't call her by her name. She's your employer, - not your friend. - -Dad, it's okay. -She ain't my nothing. - I don't work here, mate. - -Just take them out, Asher. -Excuse me? - What did you call me? -The fuck's your problem? -Asher, take the tiles out. - I'm helping you out. Don't have to be - a bitch about it. Asher, get out. - -Asher. Ash, mate. It's not worth it. Relax, man. - -GEMMA: Victor, don't... What's your name? What's your name? Your name? - I'm Kieran. My name's Kieran. - What's your name? -Marina. -Marina. Marina's your name. Okay, Marina, I'm just gonna ask you... - -No, no, no. -It hurts? You're in pain. - Okay, I'm a paramedic. -Look, I'm a paramedic. -No, no, I can't. Okay, I know it hurts, but you have to... One moment, legs down. I'll ask you to roll to your side, okay? You're gonna roll over to your side. You're doing great. You're doing great. Okay, that's perfect. Just breath with me, okay? (BREATHING DEEPLY) Is there anyone else I can call for you, Marina, anyone? No. No, I don't have anyone. Okay. Don't worry. I'm here, okay? Any second now the ambulance is gonna be here, all right? But you're doing brilliant. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) He made you some sugary tea. Where's your phone? I am fine. I just skipped breakfast. I was out late. Drinking. Drinking with who? My landlords. "Future husband"? I don't know his name, so... The tea guy? It's a joke, Wilson. Unless you like him. Close your eyes. Do you need an intervention? I've watched you drown twice in two weeks. And you're making some impulsive, crazy decisions. Would you hold still? Maybe I should quit too... Yeah. You should. (GROANS) We should be doing this together. Adventures. London. Staying out late, drinking. You shouldn't be alone. (DOOR OPENING) MAN: How are you feeling? Tea's from me. She said. Thanks. No problemo. -Er, Moira, we're gonna... -Okay. (MOUTHING) Future husband. KIERAN: Everyone is here. Have you got her? No, Please don't leave me. - No, I'm not... I'm not leaving you. - I am not leaving you. Okay, Marina, I have got your shopping. Everything is gonna be fine. Okay? What's with the silverware? Oh, there was a fundraiser. That's why I'm in London. Oh. I thought you'd come to see me. I made you this. I've eaten, thank you. It's only small. Nick tells me you've taken a lodger. You should be settling down, not living like squatters. Kieran's a good man. If he intends to make an honest woman of you, he has my permission. Just eat something, Dad. Perhaps next time. I have to be somewhere else. Of course. Look, I know this place may not look like much and I know you'd prefer better for me and I know that comes from a good place, but I am proud of what I've got. What I've made. What I'm making. Kieran won't propose to me because he respects the fact that I think that marriage is bullshit. But if he ever did, the only... permission he'd require is mine. Goodbye, Gemma. Marina, stay with me. Look at me. Stay with me. Marina, stay with me. Look at me, Marina. That's right, stay with me. Look at me. Look at me. (MOBILE RINGING) All right, Marina... Stay with... She's fitting, she... NAIMA: You okay? Oh, God! (SIGHS) RAY: Hey. Oh. Hey. How was your thing? Fine. How was your day? Also fine. No customers. Again. I thought you might want this. The poor guy doesn't even know how to talk to me. Mum died and left him with... a queer, angry brown girl in a quaint little village. Here. -Thank you. -I got put on report... for kissing Sarah Finch and he stopped talking to me. Entirely. It wasn't until I was with Kieran, that he remembered he even had a daughter. Do I smell chlorine? Oh, yeah. God. I have to wash my hair. I've had the same hairstyle since I was 12. I really want to cut it all off, but Moi says I should, er, stop making impulsive decisions. Moi is your friend, yeah? Yes. Friend. Best friend. Moira. She's on the synchro team. She has the same hairstyle too. The whole team do. -Sorry, I... -It's all right. I actually like people touching my hair. I've lost my job today. I'll find something else. -What happened? -Nothing. Nothing. It was weird. I was in the water, and I, sort of, just had to get out. Oh, like a panic attack? No. No. It sounds like it could've... It was nothing really. I'll find another job. I promise. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. This is... This is delicious. It's, erm, my grandmother's recipe. I've lived off protein shakes my whole life, so I'm not the best judge, but this is... seriously amazing. Oh, my goodness. Why are you crying? Why are you crying? I don't know! (MOBILE RINGING) I'll cut it. I'm all for impulsive decisions. No. Yeah, I've seen what you've done to this place, you think I'm gonna let you near my hair? (GEMMA LAUGHING) What are you doing? Oh, er, yeah... I have made a complete pig's bollocks of this. I went rogue. Just... Just shave it all off. Oh, can I? Obviously, no. (DOOR OPENING) KIERAN: Hello? Hi, we're here, we're here, we're in here. (LAUGHING) -Hi. -GEMMA: Hi. RAY: Hi. How was your day? -Yeah, it was fine. -Mmm-hmm. -So you... -Voila. What voila? You okay? I was think... I was thinking I'll just call in sick. What? Why? I just didn't sleep today and... Just have a coffee. Don't you want me... -No. -...to be here? - It's just you never call in sick. - What's going on? - Why does something... Why does something - have to be going on? Don't be weird. I'm not being weird. How's that... Sorry, I'm just, er... (CLEARS THROAT) Do you have mint tea? Yes, it's, erm, in the cupboard. On the right, yes. Thanks. Mugs are up here if you want it. -Oh, sorry... -Oh, sorry. Anyone want tea? -No, thank you. -I won't, thank you. Oh, Ray, you should let Kieran check you out. Excuse me? No... Kieran, erm, suffered from panic attacks -when he left the military. -I didn't have a panic attack. Sorry, what... Why are we talking about this? Nothing. I was, erm, I was in the water and I felt... claustrophobic. It wasn't anything. Well, you had an accident not too long ago, so... it's only natural that maybe you feel a bit... I'm fine. Sorry, could we not... I'm gonna get another job. Don't worry about rent. No, that's... I didn't mean that. (KETTLE BUBBLING) GEMMA: Hey, K, it's me... Er... Look, I'm sorry it was weird earlier. Let's talk about it tomorrow. I hope that's okay. Ti amo. Ciao. Hey, Gem, it's me... I missed your call. Again. Anyway, you're probably going to bed soon so... -I will see you in the morning... -Kieran, man... I'm just... Do you need the bathroom? No, you go ahead. I don't mind. No, I need to, ideally, be after. Oh. Oh! D'accord. I'll be quick. CHRIS: I'm really sorry. And just so you know I've got two job interviews tomorrow. And a haircut. Oh, God. I'm so sorry! Listen, I mean, about earlier, with Kieran, I really wasn't trying to make you feel like... Not a problem. He's a good person to talk to about that sort stuff, if you feel the need. RAY: You said he had panic attacks? GEMMA: When we first met, yeah. He'd just come out of the army. -He'd seen a roadside bomb... -Oh, God. Yeah, er, it pretty ruined him. But he's okay now. He's done a lot of work on himself. -I'll be quick. -No, you... take your time. I think they put milk in both. Can you just give me a minute? Let me check. Can you just give me one minute, bro? -Yeah. -Chris! Yeah, they're both... it's not even like cow milk. I think it's oat or cashew or... Oh, my days. Can I please just have five minutes of fucking peace? Just five fucking minutes. Well, you're fun tonight. And you've got glitter on your face. Ooh. That's actually really nice. Man. Don't make me be the guy that orders cashew milk. What? You were married, right? Briefly. What went wrong? Really? Why? You thinking of proposing? (SIGHS) So what's stopping you, bro? (RADIO CHIMES) Oh, Chris, can we please just not take that? Not very Hippocratic oath-y of you. I'm serious, Chris. I can't do it, man. Don't worry, man. I'll drive. (SIREN WAILING) -Have you got any change, mate? -No, sorry, mate. Hey, mate. Come on, mate, please. Oi, calm down. What you doing? What the fuck are you doing? -Fuck. Fuck. -Oi! CHRIS: You shit. Calm down, all right. Calm down. Chris. Yo, bro. Oi! -Get off me! Get off me! -Come on. Get off me! (MOBILE RINGING) Dee? (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) Ray. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - DEE: And I'm telling you that they are frail, - elderly people. They shouldn't be... Where is he? Where is he? I called you as soon as they called me. Nurse, Kieran Lovell? Lovell. The paramedic. He's in recovery. -I need to see him. -He's just come out of surgery. - His parents are in the waiting room - if you want to... Yeah, and they've been here all night! - -What? Who? -Next-of-kin Paul - and Ruth Howley, -parents. -Foster parents. I'm his biological sibling. - -This is his sister. I'm his partner... - -We're next-of-kin. Can someone just tell me if he's going to be okay? We're trying to help. Gemma. I'm sorry they called you. Are you okay? He's, er, out of surgery. He's had a small brain bleed and he's been stabbed. -GEMMA: Oh, God. -In the side. RUTH: They say he's lost a lot of blood and there's some damage to his spleen, but... (ALL TALKING SOFTLY) Whassup! What have you done to your hair? Were you at the hospital? When I had the accident? What's going on? I hadn't really thought of it. How scary that must have been for you. And yesterday, when I freaked out in the water... Babe... You're right. I don't know what I'm doing. Do you need me to tell you to come home? Because you can. You could just drive home right now - and tell the landlords it was a big mistake - and come back. Or do you need a pre-match pep talk? (TOILET FLUSHING) Were you just on the loo? Come on, Wilson, you wallowy bitch. Get out of your head. Setbacks happen so you have to push harder. Be better. Go, go, go, go, go. Bye... (EXHALES SHARPLY) DEE: God, they look old. And how are they still next-of-kin? We're here now. Just don't think about updating this shit. Is his will up to date? I don't think he has one. He did one when he joined the army. I didn't know. Have you called your mum? -I'll call her if he dies. -Jesus, Dee. I'm not in a good place to be dealing with this. I'm going for a smoke. Oh, shit. Danny. I need to pick him up. -Gem. -What the fuck happened? What? Thanks. I owe you one. He'll be all right, Gem. He's a soldier... Oh, amor. (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) RAY: Knock knock. Hey. I won't bother you. Just, er, a few things from home. How's he doing? They're keeping him sedated, but they say he's going to be all right. Oh, thank God. How are you doing? What's with the hat? I missed my hair appointment. Oh, no. Oh, my God, yes. There's some food and snacks and... (EXCLAIMING) And a jumper. Another jumper. And socks and pants for Kieran too! Is that okay? I didn't want to rummage around without asking, but... No, it's is really, really thoughtful of you, Ray. Thank you. Do you have a will? My dad made me do one online. Not that I have anything worth leaving anyone. He thinks it's something every grownup should do. So much to do as a grownup. Oh! Will you do something for me? Sure. Will you, er, open up for me tomorrow? How do you know I won't rob you? Because there's nothing worth stealing. And I know where you live. And my laptop too! This is exactly... (WOMEN MOANING) That was, erm... Porn. Yep. -You have my number, right? -Yeah, yeah. Will you stay for a bit? Only if... Is that weird? -No, if you want me to stay... -Only if you... I just don't want to be in your way. No. Please? Just for a bit? What are the options again? RAY: Buried. Cremated... -You sure you want to do this now? -GEMMA: Mmm. It's sort of soothing to think about my own death. My mum was buried, but I don't think she wanted that. To take up space. I missed her funeral. Didn't leave hospital for a month. Dad took me to her grave, but I couldn't really... Couldn't connect it to her. I'd go into the attic instead and try on her clothes until they stopped smelling like her. I kept some of her things. When the '90s came back and all her... horrible shirts became amazing. Oh, wow, I'm really rambling now. I'm delirious. I'd like to be... shot into space. Is that an option? Erm, I don't see it on the form. But there's a special requirements section. There is? Now, in that case, write down "Staked through the heart." So you don't rise again. Got it. Unlikely, I know, but... No, you can't be too careful. -Staked then beheaded? -(LAUGHING) Then you've got all bases covered. Or... or blended? Take all your entrails and... (IMITATES BLENDER) (SOBBING) KIERAN: Can you get me some water, please? Gemma! Gemma! Just some water... I'll get someone... Someone? Slowly. Slowly. Thank you. You're welcome. Gemma. Ow. Oh, babe. Oh. No, you absolutely can't be doing that. KIERAN: (GROANING) Fuck this. (LAUGHING) Sorry... NURSE: I'm just gonna take your blood pressure. God, I gave you this for a reason. I know, babe. I know. Ow. You silly man. (SIGHING) (GROANING) You're not trying. I promise I am. GEMMA: I want to get you home. KIERAN: In two or three weeks, babe. Was this my fault? -Did I make you... -No. We've been working every possible second. You've not been sleeping. We've been fighting. Been thinking about Ray... How she ignored the signs. This is a... It's not your fault, Gem. ...big flashing neon sign. For what? I don't know. Something. One more time. (KIERAN GROANING) There you go. KID: Come on! MAN: No running. (EXHALES) KIERAN: Er... hi. I just wanted to, erm, to say thank you for the bag of pants. Gem can't stop talking about you. I mean, I got stabbed in the spleen, yet all she's talking about is your pants bag. It's Kieran, by the way. (GRUNTING) (MOBILE RINGING) Hey, can... Can I... CHRIS: Right, we're here, kids. That'll be £7.99, please. Can I call you back? I'm... MOIRA: I've done it! I've quit the team! I'm coming to London! Hello? -I'm... I'll call you back. -Okay. GEMMA: There's still a lot to do. You've done this? Well, Ray helped. A lot. Enjoy your retirement. I'll miss you, bro. You soppy... Yo, is that your lodger? -Right, bye, Chris. -Jesus. Welcome home. Inside pocket. Thank you. Nice hair. What's going on? Right, Gem, will you show me inside? Why are there candles? Who... -Did you... -I'll see you later. No, you won't. What the fuck's happening? -Gem, come inside with me. -RAY: Good luck. No... (EXCLAIMS IN PORTUGUESE) Stay where you are! Look, there's a plan, okay... No. Not this. -Come on, Gem, just... -No, is this what's happening? -I'm really not part of it. -Just let me talk for a second. No, I absolutely won't. This... You don't believe in... I do. Okay, well, I don't believe in it. This is a crisis move when a relationship is dying. No. No, I don't think that's true. -Can you please let me go? -Did my dad set you up to this? What? No. Ray, can you go upstairs, please? You stay where you are. Is this because you nearly died? -No, it isn't. All right? -That's not a good reason to... Gem, I got the ring before the accident. -How long before? -The day before. Er... (GROANING) Yes, all right, fine, it's fucking romantic, you sneaky bitches. (COUGHS) Yeah, but did anyone clean out the chimney though? Ray and I did our best. (COUGHING) Look, Gem, if you really don't wanna get married, then, okay, let's not. I can't offer you much. I'm not rich. I'm impulsive. I'm insecure. I can't even get down on one knee to do this properly. You're rubbish, I get it. (LAUGHING) What I'm saying is... I'm your person. And I'm not going anywhere. Because you can't walk unaided? That's it. No... I'm taking this whole thing back. Proposal retracted. Okay, (COUGHING) might actually now be dying. Okay. Fuck it. Fine. For whatever bullshit male reason you clearly need to do this whole thing, but for my own legitimate reasons, I don't want to be proposed to. And I won't take your last name. But... you're right. You're my person. And... I've been yours for a long time, and I'm going to be yours forever. And you're not rubbish. You're a hero. So let's, I mean... It feels stupid calling myself your girlfriend anyway. And fiancee sounds pretentious, so, all right, fine, I'm your wife. And you're my husband. That's what we are. So let's make it official. Right? I mean... I'm saying yes. What about you? Answer quicker. (LAUGHING) (SNIFFLES) Oh, she's good. She's really good.
