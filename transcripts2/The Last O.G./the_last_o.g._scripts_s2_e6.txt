 This right here... Wash this out. I think it's still got some life to it. Come on, cuzzo. I didn't know you had mad mechanic skills like that. Believe it or not, man, I learned all of this from my first high school girlfriend. - Get the fuck outta here. Word? - For real, boy. Big Marge, man. She was 300 pounds, man. - Could change a flat tire without a jack. - 300, though? Mm-hmm. I don't know if I can handle all of that, cuzzo. That's a lot.

 Can't go wrong with a girl big and strong, man. - We used to bang everywhere. - Really? You talkin' about, like, in public? - You know what I'm sayin'? - No, everywhere on her. Yeah, man. All I had to do was lift a fold. - What? - You know what's in there? - What's that? - Gold. Well, call me a leprechaun. I'm about to go dig. You know what? It's this right here, man. This is cool, man. You know, I really appreciate you teaching me all this stuff, man, you know, 'cause I ain't never...

 Let me tell you something, Bobby. Everybody needs somebody to talk to, man. Only prison could keep me from you, man. This is a safe space. I want you to let it out. I'm just sayin', you know, I ain't never opened up to nobody. You know the codes of the street. You can't be in touch with your feelings. But ever since you got out, man, it's been... You know, I been feelin'... Shay. Yeah, Shay-Shay, what up? You need me to come over and help with the kids? Wow. You ain't never asked me that before. - I'm there. - So, I was just... Oh, like, you just gonna break out like that? What happened to only prison was keeping you away? Sorry, Bobby, my biological kids need me. But I'm just sayin'... You're a grown man, man. Figure some stuff out on your own. Look, I don't know what this is! Well, Google it! "Abandonment issues." Oh, that's deep. - Josh. - Mm-hmm? You're a white girl in your 20s. Which one of these makes you want to buy our new athletic line? Uh, all right, white girl I can do, but it's been a long time since my 20s. This one? Cool. Oh, that must be Tray. Hey, uh, babe, I know you're slammed with Fashion Week, but I really don't think I need Tray's help with the kids. Oh, wow. That's a lot of stuff. - Yeah, I guess I could pretend to need him. - Mm-hmm. - Josh! - What's up? I'm good, man. Ready and willing. Okay, you two, I need you guys to go ahead and go over this schedule and figure out who's gonna do what, where they're gonna do it, when they gonna do it, and who's gonna get it done, all right? - Mm-hmm. - You guys have a good one. - Bye. - Mwah! Man, this looks like how murderers - keep track of they victims. - Yeah. Let's do this. I will take Amira to her afternoon tutoring session. You take Shahzad to Supercuts. - Sooga, you got jokes. - Come on. I mean, I know it's not the coolest place in the world, but he likes it. We get our hair cut together. - That's cool. - It is fine for you, but no self-respecting black man would get his haircut from a place like that. You can't speak for your entire race. - That's... - I can and I do... except for them ones that's mixed with Asian. I like them, but, you know, that's some new shit to me. I'm gonna run him on down to the barbershop I used to go to, Howard's. I ain't been back there since I came home anyway. Really? Why? You know, my man, Jaybird at the halfway house? He be hookin' me up. You know what I'm sayin'? Till the cops came and confiscated all his razors for evidence in a cold case. Man, back in the days, Howard's was the heart and soul of Brooklyn. That's where you went to find out what was the word on the streets. I ain't been here in so long. Wow! I remember when you was a kid. Aw, man. Chico! - What up, baby? - What up, baby? Is that Tray Biz-ag? - Howie How! What up, baby? - Aw, man. Yo! Give me some. And this has got to be either your clone or your son. This is my seed right here, Shahzad. - What's up, little man? - Hey, what's up, man? Hey, let me tell you, your dad was the only dude tough enough that, when I cut his hair, it cut back. I just want to give my son a real barbershop experience. Hey, listen, no problem. But we not just a barbershop anymore, Tray. Now we're a gentleman's salon. - Gentleman's salon? - Yeah. Like, this is where I watch strippers get their hair washed? Things changed while you were locked up, man. But this is an institution, and if it ain't broke, why fix it? I got to keep up with the competition. Look, I even brought in some new barbers. Naw, Howard, I ain't trusting my son's hairline with no dude from the Pringles can. Nah, I got you, man. Your hairline will be so sharp, you ain't gonna be able to get past TSA. Give me two seconds to finish up this customer, all right? All right. See, this used to be my spot. Now it's your spot, too. - Yo, Tray. - Felony. What's up, man? What's going on? - What up, Shahzad? - What's up? Oh, man, you look a mess. I guess we both gotta start paying for haircuts now that Jaybird's officially a "person of interest." Why he like razor blades so much? - The heart wants what it wants. - Mm. Anyways, it's the weekend. It's time to get it right. Even made an appointment with these Vietnamese ladies to get my feet hooked up. _ Hell no! It's a little game we play. Anyway, in the meantime, maybe one of y'all can hook me up. - I'm booked till February. - Shit, I'll cut you before I cut you. Beat it! Oh, my bad. It's even now. Thanks. Uh, can I have everyone's attention? I'd like to thank you all so much for working so hard. And the good news is, Copeland's might let us go ahead and do something more couture next year. Who's with me? All right. Let's do this. Growing up in the projects, there's one of two options, man... The post office or prison, and I do not look good in them mailman shorts. But I'm gonna flip it on the prison system with my food truck. That's right. I'll make your taste buds my bitch. Yo, my sweets gonna make your teeth do a cavity search, and not with no prison guard with a little flashlight. Let me tell you somethin'. When I pull my food truck up in front of this barbershop, y'all better not be cheap. Dig down deep. If you can pay $7 for a latte, you can spend $3 on the coffee that been filtered through some drawers and an old doo-rag. This is the barbershop. All family. I'm so happy to be home. The longest day ever. Just want to lay down. How was the schedule and everything with Tray? - How'd that work out? - I don't know. It's okay, I guess. What's wrong with you? Uh, 11 unanswered calls? I was gonna call again, but 12 unanswered calls seemed like a... a bridge too far for me. I'm sorry, but it was a long day. - It was crazy at work, okay? - Crazy? But I'm home now. - Mm-hmm. - What was the emergency? Ew. A dick pic? That don't even look like yours. - Why you got that on your phone? - It's not mine. This is not my phone. It's Amira's phone. What?! Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, God. Okay, okay. Are you... Is this all you're gonna say? - What did you say to her? - Nothing. I sent her to her room, and I told her you'd talk to her. - Why? - Why? 'Cause isn't this a classic mother-daughter conversation? I can't. She's still my little baby girl. Oh, good. Y'all here. So, I've been thinking. Instead of going to college, I decided I want to be a barber. Dibs on that one. What did you and Tray do to my kids today? Hey, kiddo. What you doing? Oh, I'm just playing this game, - but, like, if you... - That's cool. Hey, uh, you know that whole, uh, not-going-to-college thing, - did you really mean that? - Yeah. Tray took me to this dope barbershop today, right? - Mm-hmm. - So, like, just to hang out at a place like that, as your job, like, would be the best. Yeah, I just... Just feel like, you know, being a barber would kind of be a waste of your talents. But you and Mom always said you support anything we want to be. We lied, son. We lied to you. Oh, wow. - That's messed up. - Mm-hmm, I know. Good talk. - Hey, girl. - You're still here? I thought you had to work all weekend for Fashion Week. Uh, yeah, I decided to take the day off work. I thought that maybe we should hang out together. You know, maybe get our hair did, just hang out as girls, girl. - Us? - Mm-hmm. - Together? - Mm-hmm. - Me with you? - Yeah. We could catch up on some girl chitchat. You know, hang out as girls, girl. Why do you keep saying "girl"? I-I don't know. Just put your coat on, girl. Come on. We're just gonna make one quick little stop. I made you an appointment at Dr. Sumen's. Why am I going to see your OB/GYN? No reason. I just... think that it's time that we get you started on, um... birth control. Birth control? Why? You got boys sending you pictures - of their ding-a-ling in your phone! - Oh, my... And so... ... I figured that's what you gonna need. A boy didn't send that. Jessica Peters did. Why would a girl send you pictures like that? Because it's for the "Dick Report." The... What in the hell is that?! From now on, can we both agree on using the word "ding-a-ling"? It was just a joke, okay? Jessica Peters collects the pictures from the boys, and then, the girls compare them in the "Dick Report." Well, Amira, I don't want you lookin' at nasty pictures of boys' ding-a-lings. And this Jessica Peters sounds like a real slut, - if you ask me. - She is! Mom, I'm still a virgin, okay? I'm not... Ugh! Having sex. Whew! Thank you. Thank you. My baby is pure. - Oh, quick question. - Uh-huh? So, is giving oral still considered sex? Is what?! It was a question. I don't actually do it. Well, next time, maybe you should lead with that. Yeah, look at it, observe it. - Right, man. - Don't cut it till you're sure. Don't clip it till you sure. I promise you, Aaron, you about to pick up mad Puerto Rican chicks. Hey, what's all this? Kid got real talent. Aaron's letting me practice my barber skills on him. Uh-huh, yeah, but, uh... hey, I thought we settled this. I was gonna let the barber thing go like you told me to, but Tray and Bobby bought me these nice clippers, and I gots to say, I really like cutting. Well, I didn't really buy the clippers. I got it from my man that, you know, cut at the funeral home. Tray, I kind of assumed that we were gonna be on the same page about this barber thing. What's wrong with being a barber? Growing up, that was one of the most prestigious positions in the neighborhood. You had the teacher, the preacher, and then the barber, and then, on top of all that, you had the dude that could dunk over a car. I get it. I get all of it. But come on. I mean, we're talking about my son here, so... - This is how the boy used to look. - Mm. Yeah, Shahzad gave him a haircut. It's not a religious calling, Tray. Josh, please don't tell me that you are jelly 'cause I introduced him to something I was interested in. That's ridiculous. - That is ridiculous. - 'Cause that would be petty. I don't... I would... I'm not... That's... That's ridiculous. Listen, I know how to settle this, all right? We're gonna let the experts decide. What does that mean? Everybody, let's go. Let's go. Transform and roll out. Let's roll. Dick pics? Somebody's sending you dick pics? It's nothing. It's nothing. No, I want to hear Ms. Ashley's opinion. Go ahead, Val. I mean, you seem a little young for that, that's all. Kids nowadays aren't like we used to be. We need to be grateful they don't have our sexual hang-ups. Can we please change the subject? - Who sent who a dick pic? - Oh. Oh, some boy sent a picture of his junk to her. No, it was a girl. Jessica Peters. Jessica Peters. She sounds white. Mm-hmm. - Okay, that's racist. - Maybe. But you still go to that fancy school? It's not that fancy. The girls there think that blowjobs ain't even sex. - What the hell? - What?! That's crazy! Amira, you not doing that, are you? No. Oh, my goodness. Never do that. It's against God. And the only reason they even invented oral sex was so white people could keep black folks from procreating and taking over the world. Now, when you're older, it's different. I don't let my husband leave for work without hooking him up. I want him going out the door on E. That's how I know he comin' back. Oh, girl get outta here. Ain't nobody got time for all that. My man be lucky if he get a cup of coffee. Now, listen, don't listen to them. When you are older, you will decide for yourself what you want and what you don't want. And don't let anybody pressure you into nothin'. Just pretend I'm not here. Hey, listen, that white girl from your school, now, she can be a ho and still grow up to be president. - Mm-hmm. - But not us. If you are even rumored to have fooled around with a boy in the boiler room, folks will talk about it like you ain't ever done shit else in your life. People will bring it up years later. And on Facebook, instead of saying, "Hey, Val, heard you opened up a beautiful salon," they write, "Hey, 'Kneepads', how you been?" All right, I think that's enough. I think that's enough. Yeah. I just came here to show you what my son did. Behold. Ah. Oh. Okay. - Not bad. - You really hooked him up. All right. I see, son. I see you got a little skills, man. Nah, y'all don't get it, man. This was his first cut. - Word? - First cut? - I don't know about... - That's impressive, man. - That's... No. Yeah. - No, I don't... - He can't even see over the chair. - He too small. - Come on, man. - Feet low! He's dainty. Who taught you? Nobody. My son is a Jedi master with them clippers. You can leave, Aaron. Thanks for coming down, baby. I don't know where I am. Google Maps, Aaron! His first cut. What you think? I don't know, man. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Y'all think he could be that good? I mean, that was the last time I heard of someone starting that young. What? What is it? The Legend of Siz. What's that? Siz was the greatest barber in the borough of Brooklyn. He was my mentor. It all started back in 1986. One day, this guy comes running into the shop. He's clearly distressed, right? Siz, you gotta help me. I got a show tonight. My boy was linin' me up, his hand slipped, and... Man, I can't go on stage like this. Thanks, Siz. You the man. You're welcome, Big Daddy Kane. After his show that night, Big Daddy Kane's album shot straight up the charts. The rest is history. - Who's Big Daddy Kane? - Shh. Man, that's nothin' compared to what I saw Siz do. When I was in junior high, I'll never forget it. Okay, I'm starting to doubt some of these details. But continue. Yeah. I knew him, too. We did time together. He was an OG. In fact, I'm the one he gave his last cut to. - He did great things. - Yeah. Things that no one has done since. - Word. - Maybe that's because he's... And you, too, have that gift. - Mm-hmm. - This is ridiculous. My son is gonna be more than just a barber. What... So, what you sayin', white boy? Ay, you disrespectin' Siz's legacy, yo. Well, I wouldn't say that. Siz's dream wasn't to be a barber. It wasn't? Nah. He told me one night he dreamed of being a surgeon, but he didn't have any surgery role models in the hood. So he used his gifted hands for something he had access to... cutting hair. No disrespect, but it wasn't my dream to be a barber, son. I wanted to be a music producer, yo. I got beats. Truth be told, I always wanted to go to college. Always wanted to go to an all-black college and play lacrosse. Truth be told. Yeah, man, the barber's life ain't the end goal, unless you gonna own your own shop. - I netted $200K last year. - Really? Oh, now you gonna be on board, Josh? Oh, come on! Money's still important. I want him to be able to take care of himself. - See, that is the difference between me and you. - What? You want him to make a lot of money. I want him to live his dreams. No, that's not what I meant. Shouldn't this be my decision and mine only? Yeah. Yeah, it should. True. So, what do you want to do? Seriously? Y'all got time for all of this, but I can't get a chair? I know how to settle this. Yo, make sure you get my taper, little man. It's gotta be tight. - What's happening? - Shh! This is the time for the blend. It's the hardest part. Come on. You got it, Little Tray. The gift is strong on this one. Tell him to remove the guards. What?! I can't tell him that, Siz! He won't have any control! He'll just have to go on... Feel. Feel. Tell him, Tray. Shahzad... remove the guard. What?! What are you talking about?! Let go. He's not ready! I am so scared. Everything'll be fine. Remove the guards! Remove the guards! This is free, right? _ _ _ _ _ I actually found a few four-year colleges that have barber education programs so that he could take business classes, too. Man, you ain't got to go to college to get no degree. This scar is my bachelor from the streets. - You want to see my doctorate? - No. What is all this? Hey, nothin'. Just some successful co-parenting. Yeah, it's kind of our thing, you know? Oh, you guys have a thing now? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, we got a thing. - Dudes can have a dude thing. - Oh. Hey. There's the barber genius himself. People gonna be like, "Siz who?" I decided I don't want to be barber no more. What? What are you talking about? You have a gift. Well, there's this really hot girl at school, and she's into me. Her name's Jessica Peters, and she loves music. So I think I'm gonna just be a musician. Yeah. Jessica Peters, huh? I heard him. Hey, hey. Hey, Shay, where you going? To break Amira's phone. She'll thank me later. Man, he pulled out a flute. You can't make no money with a flute, man.
