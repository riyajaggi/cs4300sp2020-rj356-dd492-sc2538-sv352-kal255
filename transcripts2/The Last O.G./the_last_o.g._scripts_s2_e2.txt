 _ All my life, I've been a people person. I get along with everybody. Get off me, man! Get off me! Kitchen's our side of the prison. - You don't belong here, boy. - I ain't never been a boy, man. I was born with a grown-man dick, you understand? Looked like a baby arm holding an apple. Leave him alone! I suggest you step off before you get dealt with. Come on, Billy. He don't belong on our side.

 Tray's good. He's the one I told you made those "Poppin' Off Tarts." For your birthday? Yeah, the ones with the sprinkles. Aw, hell, man. Those were the shit. My bad. Whatever, man. You tried to kill me, man. We're good. For now. B, good looking. They gonna put me on the set, man. - Somebody gotta hold me down. - Nah, Tray. That ain't you. I got a better idea. Come on. Yo, Cookie. This here's the dishwasher I told you about... Tray.

 I thought he could help you out. Nah, I don't need no help. Wait a minute, Cookie. Before you say no, why don't you give me your leftover - ingredients and watch the magic. - Okay. Okay, all I need is the salt from this. Put some SPAM in here. Who doesn't love SPAM? Once I separate the spoiled part of this potato salad, the paprika is all I need. My version of hot wings. I call them "Ghetto Burners" 'cause they're made with the pepper spray from the guards. Good, huh? I just got an erection for the first time in years. How did you figure this out? Just like how the slaves took parts of the hogs and bitter roots and they invented soul food. I just did what I could do with what I had. So, what do you think, Cookie? You gonna let me train under you? Otherwise, the Brotherhood... they're gonna cut me from hole to hole and have me looking like a black piñata. Billy, let the Brotherhood know that Tray works with me. He's neutral. Thank you, Cookie. Thank you so much. And you can pay me back with some of those special recipes. Like I said, I get along with everybody. Listen, nobody likes to remind you that you ain't shit more than me. In fact, you ain't shit. But look, gentlemen, you're not supposed to be down on yourself. This is why I try to motivate you. Y-You think I don't understand how hard it is to get back out there in the workplace and start over? - I do, because I've done it. - Mullins, the struggle is real. I don't care how many résumé classes you give us. Or interview classes. Or "redding" classes. - Reading class. - Reading classes, Big Country. Look, if you live here, you work. That's the agreement that you all signed up when you got here, so if you don't want to work, live somewhere else. You're not hearing me, Mullins. I'm not saying I don't want to work. I'm just saying maybe I'd be better off doing it for myself. As what, a Biz Markie impersonator? Come on, man, as a chef. Everybody here know what I'm good at. I been cooking for y'all ever since I've been here, okay? I just want to create someplace where people be happy with my food, with something that I made. But you wouldn't know about that, 'cause you don't know about dreams, Mullins. I wouldn't know about dreams? You guys... see, y'all think that this halfway house is the end for me, but it's not. It's only the beginning. Don't tell me 'bout some dreams. Matter of fact, here. Y'all fill out these forms. I need y'all to go out and get five job inquiries on there a day, with real names and real places, - 'cause I'm gonna check them. - Uh, well, I'm gonna need a new one. I filled this out with names of Wu-Tang Clan. Are you serious, Big Country? You misspelled "RZA"? It's three letters. - Thank you. - There you go. Mom finally lets you walk us to school, and we're gonna be late. Yeah, I just need one more signature to get Mullins off my back. Wait, so you're not really interested in any of these jobs? Well, that's the problem, Amira. They're just jobs. I want to focus my energy on something bigger, like opening my own restaurant! You know, 90% of the restaurants go under in the first year. There, see, there you go. Why you gotta do the whole Darth Vader thing with me? You know what I mean? I knew a dude on death row that was more positive than you, Shahzad. Didn't you ever have stuff in life that you wanted to do one day? It was getting a perfect-attendance award, but you're ruining that by making us late now. Mnh-mnh! 'Cause we here! Look! Relax, okay? I'll see you guys later. I love you. Come on. Y'all too cool to say "I love you" to your father? We haven't known you that long. You guys have a good time, okay? See you later. One more signature. You're an ex-felon? Yep, not Rothman material. I just need you to sign this sheet right... Actually, we are part of a community re-entry employment program. Uh, we receive incentives for offering entry-level positions and training, so if you could just fill out this application... Entry-level? You know, uh, janitorial, groundskeeping, that kind of thing. Let me just level up with you, man. I wanna be a chef. You know, so if you just do me a solid, sign this sheet, you know, just to say I tried. Okay, well, let me come clean with you, as well. We're a bit behind in our quota for the re-entry program to qualify for the incentives, so if you could do me a solid and just fill out the application... just so we both can say that we tried? Same time? Same time. Okay, so, what's the difference between a secant and a chord? - Girl, I don't know! - Don't worry. It's easy. Okay, so a chord terminates on the circumference of a circle, - and a secant... - Oh, goes on indefinitely! - There you go, Sheila, hey! - Hey! Ooh, turn it up. That's my part. ♪ Aye, I need to fill up the tank ♪ ♪ No, I need to fill up the safe ♪ ♪ I need to let all these hoes know ♪ ♪ That none of they niggas is safe ♪ - Hey! - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! We don't use that word. Dad, be cool. No, my house, my rules. I'll call you back, Sheila. - Thanks for ruining homework. - Sorry. It's my job. See? I tried. Five signatures, still nothing. Nothing. The Rothman School called. You got a job working in their cafeteria. Wait a minute. I got a job in the cafeteria? I'm a chef! No, I saw how much you're getting paid. Trust me. You're a cook. Yeah, you just watch. Yeah, this is what I call a drum solo. Hey, Sheila. You ready for the geometry test? You know it, girl! Okay, bye, Mom. That's Sheila? You let a white girl use the N-word around you? It was in a song. It wasn't in a bad way. Any way is the bad way. White people buy more hip-hop than us, okay? Every artist knows that. So they must be okay with them saying the N-word, too. No, I'm not talking about rappers being okay with it. You shouldn't be. Listen, I feel like our generation is kind of taking the word back, you know? Defusing its negativity. Only black people can take that word back, not little white girls named Sheila who play field hockey. Lacrosse. Don't stereotype. Just like the only black girl in class shouldn't be on C.P. time. - Bye! - I'm not okay with that term either. Bye. - Bye, bye. - Bye. Have a good day. - Hi. - Oh. You're Sheila's mom, right? Josh Birkeland. Sheila and my daughter, Amira, they're friends. Oh, yeah, hi, hi. Yeah, Sheila talks about Amira all the time. - It's nice to meet you. - Yeah, you, as well. This is gonna seem like it's sort of out of nowhere, but, uh, something happened while the girls were studying, and I thought you'd want to know, so... Uh-oh, if it's that Sheila's dumb as a brick, don't worry. I already know. Thank God she's pretty. That wasn't it. Um, no, uh, Sheila used the N-word. Oh, no. They were singing along to some hip-hop music, and I overheard her say it. - I was like... - Oh. Oh, well, it was in the song. Yes. Yes, it was, but it's still... the N-word. Did Amira say it? That doesn't matter. I'm... I'm just saying, you know, in situations like this, you have to admit, it's a little bit... confusing, you know? Okay, you know what? Let me, uh, let me make things a little less confusing for you, okay? Uh, I'm married to a black woman with two black kids, and I'm not comfortable with your white daughter - using the N-word around my black daughter. - Oh. I'm not comfortable with Amira using it. There is too much history behind what that word means. I-I, uh, I'll talk to Sheila. Thank you. We're Jewish, by the way. - Thank you. - Yo, what up, Tray? - What's wrong? - Nothing, young Jedi. Just serving lunch. Honestly, I thought I'd be serving my dishes. Quinoa? What is that? That's Indian for "cream of wheat." Here. Try some of this. Wrap your mouth around that. Tell me what you think. What is this? This is so good! Oh, yeah! That's my "C-Block Macaroni and Cheese" made with four different cheeses. You got Cheetos in there, you got cheese puffs, Cheez Whiz, and most importantly, you got government cheese. - It is baked into that. - Wow. Yeah, see that look right there? That's why your father does what he does. 'Cause I want to bring people joy with my food. Do you think I can have this for my lunch instead? If you think that was good, I'm-a lay some more treats on you. Travel with that, beloved. Does this have sugar in it? That's against school policy. Guaranteed to make your foot go numb. You gonna be on insulin for life. I wish the other kids could taste your cooking. I'm-a lay some more treats on you later, so remember, tell a friend to tell a friend. - Gotcha. - Okay. Hey, Shahzad. I love you. Oh, come on, man. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. That's great, yes. - Hmm? - Yeah. You would've been so proud of me just now. Oh, yeah? What happened? Well, yesterday, I overheard Sheila use the N-word. Sheila better not have called my baby girl a nigger. No, no. They... they were singing along to a hip-hop song. - Oh. - I talked to Sheila's mom, and she agreed to talk to Sheila. Okay, great, thank you. - Good. - Mwah. Yeah. So, when you talk to Sheila or Sheila's mom, there's no need to bring it up. - I wasn't going to. - I know. I just, uh, I think I already said everything you would've wanted to say anyway, so... Got that. But why is it okay for you to say something, but not me? I'm saying there's no... there's no need for you to overreact. You talked to her mom because she said a word that was in a rap song. - That's overreacting. - Really? Yeah, I don't know why you're lecturing me. I'm not, it's just... you know how you are about, you know, certain things. How am I? Certain things, they make you... go off. Oh, is that why you talked to Sheila's mom? Because you thought I would "go off" on her? Well, yeah, kind of, yes. First of all, I know how to talk to people. Second, why are you all of a sudden so concerned about me? Because you scare white people when you get mad. Wow. I didn't mean it like that. - Shay. - I don't want to scare you. Shay, I'm... I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. It should not have come out that way, but if I'm being honest, you have a history of scaring white people. Why's she doing me like this? I'm rich, bitch! Look at me. Look at this dress. This dress $700. You see these shoes? Don't tell me to be quiet, okay? I got a library card. So do my man. As a matter of fact, we done donated a gag of money to this little raggedy library. This is where I live, okay?! I've been living here for quite some time! Josh, tell him. This is my property, that we live here as husband and wife! Tell him! Wha... What? Those were actual incidents. Usually when you ask me for evidence to back up my arguments, I can't. So you think all of those things happened for no reason? May I see your ID? Sure, but why'd you ask for my ID? You didn't ask for that young lady's ID that was just here. - I was just doing my job, ma'am. - But do you know her? Ladies, could you please keep it down? - This is a library. - Shh! What, really? Security, really? Aw, my keys. Dark complexion... excuse me. Is this your car? Yes. Can you help me get my keys? Okay, yeah, she's getting a little agitated. Call the police. Maybe they can get my keys out of here. See? I have plenty of reasons to go off every time. I'm sorry. You're right. Thank you. - It's just... - It's just what? I still think there may be a better way to handle certain situations. For me? Or for other people? Can't really control other people's behavior, but you do catch more flies with honey. Well, go fuck yourself, honey. Cop it and go. I'll have the off-the-menu item, please. Roll with wisdom. I'll have the illegal stuff, please. - Illegal? - Yeah, the illegal. Oh, I-I don't know what you talking about. I only have what's on this menu, man. The block is hot right now, man. I like it hot. That's fine, Mr. Barker. Come on. The fuzz is on my back, man. - What? - I got to lay low, man. Not right now. All eyes are on me. Come back later. Get! - Aah! - Hey, Mr. Barker. Timmy, you scared the shit out of me! You told me to come back later. Can I please have the goods now? I don't know, Timmy. I'm looking in your eyes, man. You're just jonesing too hard. I'll pay you. I'll pay... I'll pay you. Timmy, I don't do this for the money. - I just love to cook. - Please! I need this. Get yourself together, Timmy. - Busted, Mr. Barker. - Aw, hell, nah! What is this? Chocolate M&M; and Cocoa Puff muffin, that's it. No, this is diabetes on a plate, Mr. Barker. Follow me to my office. You're free to leave, Timothy. - Sorry you got fired, cuzzo. - Thanks. You know what? I miss feeding the kids already, man. I just want a job with a purpose. What it sounds like is that you need to work for you. Start your own restaurant, cuzzo. Man, you know my money ain't long like that, Bobby. - I told you that. - All right, all right, all right, so, look, listen. What if the restaurant had wheels? Yes. Yes! Do not tell Mullins. But I'm actually about to use something I learned in one of his classes. I know where you going. Prop comedy. - You know something? The way you think... - Yeah. ...it's gotta be a disorder. Mullins is good. Did you see what he did with the cucumber? - That's the one. - Whoo-hoo! Look, I'm sorry, Tray. You don't qualify for the loan, because you have no credit. Zero, zilch. I'm-a be straight with you, man. I was locked up. I never had a credit card before. I'm just trying to get my life together. That's why I got to hit you with this. Bam. Business plan. Yeah, it's... interesting. Um... but, look, even if you qualify for a loan for the truck, you're still looking at another $50,000 for equipment and the permit. - Say what? - Damn. All right, all right, I got this, cuzzo. Run my credit. Sure, yeah, um, what's the Social? All right, here we go. Here we go. One of these. All right... uh, oh, here a good one. This one's got a white last name. Okay, all right, you want the Jewish. Smickleson. Huh? Daniels, party of two? Hi. I wanted to apologize again, about last night. So you thought inviting me to my favorite restaurant would get you out of the doghouse? Yeah, I was hoping. You know what? If I'm being honest, I do lose my temper sometimes. But you have to understand, there are plenty of times when I don't. It's not easy being a black woman. I can be mad about the same stuff that a white chick would be upset about, and people would consider me to be angry or a bitch. I mean, I get it. I do. I really get it. No, you don't. And it's okay. If I had one black homegirl, I could be having this same conversation with her right now, and she would understand exactly where I'm coming from. But I just got you, and I need you to not worry about what other people think and have my back whether I'm right or wrong, because you're my husband. Now, come on. Let's eat. Right this way, please. Wait, didn't they come in after me? They sure did. I'm sorry, but I think we were here before them. - I'm sorry, what is your name? - It's Josh Birkeland. - They were before you. - No, they weren't. I-I watched them come in after my wife. Okay, so this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. You know what? We're leaving. - Honey? - We are? Yeah, we're gonna leave. We are gonna leave. This sucks! We come here a lot! Can I have a match? Thanks. Sorry! All right. Hey, how's that for not caring what other people think, huh? - Was it a little too much? - Yeah. I really wanted to eat there. Yes, me too. Sorry. - Yo, Tray, you gonna get up? - What's the point? What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or does it fester like a sore, and run? Langston Hughes. Who? Barker, get in here. Sit down. Really? You lost your job in less than a week? I'll take the next job I can get. Well, may not be necessary. I found your business plan in the trash can, and, uh... not bad. Come on. Follow me. Come on, dick licker. Oh, my God! You're giving me a food truck?! I'm giving you a chance. Plus, I'm helping a friend just clean out his salvage yard. You know, the truck was in an accident, and somebody may have died in there. I don't know, but... but, you know, he says he hears weird noises coming from it at nighttime, but... anyway, it's yours. Mullins, you know my food is good, man. This is a moneymaker waiting to happen, man. I'm a business owner! This is the proudest day of my life! You realize you're saying that standing in the back of a halfway house in your drawers? Oh, come here, Mullins, man. Give me some!
