I'm pretty sure we can just buy the first season online. I do not want to watch "Greenleaf" on no computer. Ma, I'll just mirror it to the TV. I just think you can do better. In fact, I know you can do better. Dad, what's your password? Uh, "ShaysBae." ShaysBae! Ooh, thank you, boo-boo! [LAUGHS] What? Okay. Who's on the phone? It's nothing. SHAHZAD: Alright. I got it.

You are not about to put our family's dirty laundry - on the Internet. - [SIGHS] Now, don't be afraid. We about to go upstream on this together. We up the river, boo, and it's gonna get messy. It might get messy, it might not get messy, but I'm pretty sure it's gon' get messy. Look, Mom, I'm pissed off about this chick, too. But what if we're wrong? I mean, we could be wrong. I'm gon' bust in there like the Kool-Aid Man! [BREATHING HEAVILY] I have never seen this side of you, and it is really scary. Aw, don't be scared, sweetie. I'm just working through this right now. Just remember, women are strong. No matter what happens to us, we will overcome. Uh-huh. We will. Man or no man. I'm just working through the five stages of grief right now. And right now, I'm on stage two. Which one is stage two? Anger! But wait till I get to the acceptance stage. That's when I'll have my makeup all perfect and I'll have that Mary J. Blige breakup body. But first things first, we got to finish stage two. - Let's go. - Oh. Okay. I'm... I'm going. - It's nice. - Do you want anything to drink or... - No, I'm good. - Okay. I'm good. It's nice. Walls really pop. This is cool. [KNOCK ON DOOR] What the... Hello? Aaah! Caught you red-handed, motherfucker Whoa. Whoa, whoa, Shannon. - [CHUCKLES] - Hey, Dad. Hi. Hey. Wait, Dad? This is your wife? Damn right, I am. - Oh, my name's Emily. - Oh, no, no, no. Bitch, I don't care if your name is Gilbert Grape. Why you fucking my husband? Whoa! No! You are so wrong. What did you think I was doing? You think I'm cheating on you? Yeah, she did. Oh, wow. Did you follow me here? Yeah, we did. - Snitch. - I mean... Okay, everybody, let's just take a deep breath. [BREATHES DEEPLY] 'Cause clearly, you guys aren't actively having sex right now, but I need some answers. I sponsor Emily at Narc-Anon. I was doing a sweep to make sure there were no drugs here. I have to make sure that she's clean. Well, that's not what it looked like up in here and... and... - Yeah? - I... You can stop now. Just let it sink in. That's alright. Just let it sink in. Wow, Shannon. Shannon, you screwed up big time, didn't ya? Well, you must be hiding something 'cause you didn't answer any of my calls. She was in a crisis! What's Narc-Anon? [SIGHS] Tell her. [SIGHS] Alright. Listen, uh, sweetie. Before I met your mother, before you kids were even born, I had an addiction to heroin. Whoa. Wait. You knew about this? Yeah. It's okay. That's okay. It's part of who I am. That's just the way it is. I kicked it, and I've been clean for a very, very long time. But I still need to go to meetings, and so does Emily. I'm her sponsor. But if you would have just answered the phone... - No. Don't. Stop it. - ...none of this would have even happened. - Shannon, stop it. - I'm just sayin'. Don't change the subject. We could have avoided all of this if you had just trusted me, instead of breaking down the door and acting like a crazy person. - Crazy? - Yeah, crazy. I'd rather be crazy than jealous. Okay. You're a black woman. - You need to act like it. - Pardon me?! No, no, I think he meant that as a compliment... - didn't you, Dad? - Of course I did. Yeah, I hold black women to a higher standard. Well, somehow, I am offended by that. I just want to say, um, that Josh has always been there for me. Mnh-mnh. He's great. Mm. Get your hand off my man. Get on, Becky. Okay. TRAY: Group of savages, man. Y'all a bunch of barbarians, man. Gustavo, you are ruining my cold-cut tray. Stop double-dipping. You only get to dip once. It's all good. Gustavo don't have germs. Country, you need to slow your ass down, too, man. That's all you need is more sodium in your diet. Normally, I'd be mad, but I know you're just lashing out 'cause you're depressed, so I forgive you. There ain't nobody depressed. That's what depressed people say. Mm-hmm. This right here is textbook depressed. Eating your feelings, I believe, is the term. - Mm-hmm. - [DOOR OPENS] [MULLINS SNIFFS] Is that pimento loaf I smell up in here? Oh, yeah. Somebody gave Tray a cold-cut platter 'cause he's depressed. Aw, hell. What you done did now, dicklicker? Easy, Mullins. Look at him. He's in rough shape. Of course he is. His life is in shambles. Look at him. You backsliding. I can see it. He exactly one dick hair away from going back to prison. It won't be long 'fore you're all mixed up with some criminal enterprise all over again. That's what depressed ex-convicts do. You got to watch out for that backsliding. [CHUCKLES] It ain't easy out here, is it? Is that Black Forest? [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] Amira. Scoot over. Amira. Amira! Amir... [LINE BEEPS] Yeah, the cellphone service in here is some bullshit. I usually get, like, like, two bars. Well, I'ma go outside to see if I can get a better signal. That was my daughter, kid. Shit, that's probably a butt-dial. Yo, this oldest daughter is trouble. She need to go back to Phoenix. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] I can't believe you're acting like you didn't do anything wrong. I didn't! You're being ridiculous! You're being ridiculo... Oh, don't call me... don't call me ridiculous. - Well, I just did 'cause you are. - Guys! Guys! I'm watching something here. Thank you. What? This is a little more important than your little TV show, Shahzad. Mom and Dad are about to get a divorce. Did I hear somebody mention divorce? What's happening? What are you doing here, Tray? Amira call me. What? No, I didn't. Girl, I just ran all the way over here. You sure you didn't call me? Oh, it must have been a butt-dial or something. No, we're in the middle of some really serious drama right now. Okay, I'm done. Bye. Where do you think you're going? No, you're not storming off now. No. Either you have to get over it or I can go. Oh, well, go. Go over to that old bucket-ass bitch house. - Oh, come on. - What's her name, Emily? - Go to Emily's house. - Emily? Who's Emily? Oh, Dad used to be a heroin addict. What? No, no, no, no, no. I have been... I've been clean for years. I go to meetings, I have my shit together. - That's not the point. - Mm-hmm. And he sponsors ugly white bitches named Emily - and doesn't tell me about it. - Oh, my God. Well, Emily has a little crush on Dad, so there's that, too. No, Emily does not have a crush on Dad. That girl is thirsty, Dad. Mm-hmm. It's very obvious, Josh. Everybody wait five goddamn seconds! You mean to tell me Josh is a heroin addict? This Josh right here? Josh is riding the white horse? Giddyup, giddyup horse? Wow! [LAUGHING] Wow! Hey, you know what, Tray? You can leave right now. I will leave, but I just want to say it one more time. Wow! Josh used to be a "heron" addict... Excuse me... is a heron addict! 'Cause you know what they say about heron, Josh... You try it once, you hooked from here on. [HERON] You know what this means, right? I'm not that bad. Really? That's the lesson? Man, I'm not that bad. Shit, I sold crack, but I'm not that bad. Wait a minute. "Sold." "Sold" as in past tense, right? ["GREENLEAF" PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] Listen, Shahzad, Amira. I made a mistake, but one thing I never did, I never used it. Not like this fiend! Tray, get the fuck out of my house. Yeah, fine. I'm good. I'm gone. I'ma ghost. Good. You know I came here feeling low, and it feels damn good to know your ass struggled, too. Struggle! [CHUCKLES] And just do me one favor before I go, okay, Josh? Don't use the dope in front of my kids. They precious to me. That's my world. Alright? Drugs are no-no. - And Shay. - What? [OPENS] You got poor taste in men, baby girl. [CHUCKLES] Get out of my house. Ooh. That's what I'm talking about, girl. Do that thing,girl. Wow. Look at that right there. That's a... - That's a beef patty! - Damn right at you. - Come on, baby. - That's a beef patty. - There it is. Unh. - All right. Life is good, cuz-o. Life is good. It is, man. [CHUCKLING] Yes, it is. Oh. Ooh, girl, you're put together lovely. [LAUGHS]
