 We are throwing block parties all over town. Make sure you come on down, but please, please stay hydrated. It's a scorcher out there. We don't want you passing out like somebody's mama at a Drake concert. Everybody up! It's time to wake up out your dreams and face your jacked-up realities. Mullins, man, it's hot as balls in here, man. What happened to the A/C? Well, the A/C, like most of y'all in here, is broke. Yeah, but when is it gonna get fixed? The repairman said he can't come by till this evening. I sweat like crazy. You stay down there, and I'm likely to make it rain in the worst way possible. Yeah, well, I'm not staying in this hot-ass oven, man. It smell like the devil's ass crack in here. Besides, I got a truck in that block party today. Yo, Green Eyes, come pick me up in the truck, man. We got to make sure we get a good spot on the streets, a'ight? A'ight. Hold on. D-D-Did I hear this right? You let that Green Eye fella take your truck alone? Yeah, well, what's it to you? Well, first of all, I'm a grown-ass man, and I ain't calling another dude "Green Eyes." And secondly, didn't you say that this guy's thing was robbing people? Used to be. Not no more. All I know is that the guys that live in my house, they did their time and they learned from it. This guy, he been doing criminal stuff recently. Hey, see, that's what my food truck is about... second chances. Giving people hope that they can do better. Me hiring Green Eyes is me putting my money where my mouth is. Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you. But as a side note, never literally put money where your mouth is because money is known to have, like, fecal matter on it, so when you put that money up in your mouth like that, and next thing you know, you're gonna get... Yeah, I got to get this door fixed. It always kind of come back open like this. Anyway, so... ♪ The Last O.G. 2x10 ♪ Fight the Power Ah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Let's get this money. Let's get this money. - Boy. - Yes, sir. Oh, snap. Damn, $900,000? Who can afford this? There's buildings all over Brooklyn priced like that. Motherfuckers is buying old apartment buildings, flipping them, then selling them joints as condos and lofts and shit. Yo, that's word, man. They did that to my mom's building, man. Now she got to bounce all the way to Connecticut. I miss my moms, man. _ Mom, I don't want to talk to your ass. You know what? The thing is, man, ain't even no brothers on the wall, man. - Crazy. - Hey! Can't park there. Who says so? I need this space for my workers to get in and out. But this is a big block party here, my dude. I'm on a tight construction schedule, and there's no way that I'm falling behind and losing money - because of a block party. - Mm. But this is for the neighborhood. I own this building. Nobody asked me about any block party. Well, if you own this building, how come we never see you around? Yeah, how come, Mr. Rockefeller? I bet he don't even live 'round here. - That's word. - Tell you something, man. Just 'cause you own this building don't make you Brooklyn. - Brooklyn is for the people. - That's word. This building has been run down for years. I want to ask you something. If you love Brooklyn so much, how come you people didn't buy it? Oh, so what you trying to say? You think we don't know what the word "you people" mean? See, now, you lucky this brotha's a changed man, or he'd whoop your ass three times for saying some mess like that. - Whoop his ass, Tray. - Four times! I got no time for this. So buying this building is supposed to be making Brooklyn "great again"? I voted for Obama. Oh! Oh! Oh! It's hot as hell out here. You know it's that global warming, right? - Preach, nigga. - Man-made global warming. Felony, if you don't break it down right now. I'm trying to tell you like this. Like, it's all the extra methane in the atmosphere. - Okay. - You know the culprit, right? - Veganism. - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! What? 'Cause cows fart methane. But now you got all these cows not getting eaten, but they're still farting. - Facts, B. - Science. - Facts. - You know what? You fools could actually benefit from reading a book instead of pontificating all the time. Global warming comes from the greenhouse effect. That too. And the main culprit is carbon dioxide. We knew that. Carbon dioxide comes from Jheri curl activator. How you think California got so hot? - Yo! - Wow! Yo, son, I like how you handled yourself back there. What you mean? See, my first inclination would've been to smack fire at him had he come up on me like that. But you... you handled him all intelligent-like. I guess after 15 years in the pen, man, I do do things a little differently. Yeah, I ain't mad at it. Live a lot longer that way. Yo. You good? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. You know, just been thinking about things is all. You know, it feels good not having to look over my shoulder all the time. You legit now. Yeah. First time in a long time. Yeah, and I ain't even mad that, you know, it's for so much less money. You ain't getting no raise, Dwayne. - Right. - Hey! Green Eyes getting paid? Okay, back it up. Cousin, you ain't shit. It sounds like here comes the competition, kid. Bobby, get those boxes out! - Yo, I ain't doing nothing! - Could you get that bread? - Okay. - I need that bread. - And get the big bag of Frito. - I want a raise! Green Eyes, does he make you pay for meals, too? - Yo, Bobby, come on! - Crazy, man. Stay woke, Brooklyn! How y'all feeling this afternoon? Brooklyn, let's get this party started! Make sure you check out all the fabulous vendors we have here. Make sure you go check out the street market and buy you some arts and crafts. Make sure you get your blood pressure checked at our health and wellness booth, because health is wealth, ladies and gentlemen. Give it up, party people. Eat at one of our many fabulous food trucks. We have the Easy Being Green farm-to-table truck. Give it up. Over here we have the Hit It Raw vegan truck. I know my fellas gonna love that one, yes, indeed. We have the LGB Treats dessert truck. We got the Cheese Baby, Baby Cheese. Last but not least, we got the Last Meal on Wheels. Check them out, party people, in the place to be. DJ Racks. Let's go. I'm coming in 'cause this is beautiful. All different type of people, all different kind of food. Yo, Brooklyn ain't about no $900,000 apartments. This is what Brooklyn's about, kid. - Oh, yeah! - Party people, remember to vote for your favorite food truck. The food truck that gets the most votes will get free advertising for one year on 109.6, the station that plays the hits. Yo, let me tell you something, man. We got to kick these other trucks' asses like they stole our freedom. - Yeah! - Let's do this. Here you go, one Juvenile Offender. Mmm. This is good. Yeah, you like that, huh? Mmm. What you put in here? Rihanna? That's the casing of a footlong stuffed with a Lunchable kids meal. I'm voting for you. I'm-a get everybody to vote for you. - You better. - The Last Meal on Wheels. Everybody vote for the Last Meal on Wheels! What a waste. What you mean, what a waste, man? You gonna come all the way over here - to our establishment... - Yo, Bobby. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, chill! Is there a problem, Officer? I was just saying it's a waste 'cause I'm on a diet and I can't eat anything here. - Oh. Oh. - It all smells so good, especially yours. - Thank you, man. You on a diet out here? - Yeah. Man, that's like going to a strip club with a brick tied to your dick. - Facts. - Well, listen, here. Taste this. We won't tell nobody. Mmm. I just gained five pounds. That's 'cause I just put a food baby in you. How you stay so thin working around all this good food? Oh, come on, now, you trying to get in my pants, Officer Dobbs? Here, take that with you. Okay, now you're trying to get in my pants. You know that. You know th... Bobby, Green Eyes. - What's up? - Hold the fort down. Hold the fort down. What you... Oh, oh, yo. Yo, that's his moms, yo. Hey, Ma. I didn't think you was gonna come. Oh, I didn't come for you. I came to give out fliers for the church. - Oh. - But it got so hot, I had to stop. I figure if these people can handle the heat, they'll do well in hell. Have a seat, Ma. Let me get you something cool to drink. I can get you a Green Mile Tea. It come in small, medium, or lethal injection. Why do you have to promote such negative stereotypes? Ma, what's negative about it? Order number 20-to-Life, your fries are ready! Order number 20-to-Life! Now, it's bad enough you went to prison, but now you want to glamorize it? Ma, this food truck is my pride and joy. Next to Amira, it's my greatest creation. - What about Shahzad? - He almost made the list. Win, your Prison Gang Crepes are ready! One Prison Gang Crepe. Enjoy that shit. See, that's why I didn't come to visit you in jail. I didn't want to see my son behind bars then, and I don't want to see my son behind pretend bars now. Why you think I made this truck about prison? I'm turning all the stereotypes upside down. Joel, come get your salad tossed! - Ignore that, Ma. - Mm-hmm. I'm setting a positive example, okay? An ex-con making a contribution. Look around. Look at all these people. My food is bringing them together. Yes, to laugh at you. I can never do anything good enough. What else do you want from me, Ma? I just want you to do the right thing. - That's it? - That's it. Got it. Joel, come get your salad tossed! Yo, Joel, hurry up! I keep waiting to toss your salad! I'll be right back. Hold on. - Cuzzo, you all right? - Yeah. Maybe my mom's right about me putting a bad image out there. Yo, they said the same thing about NWA, right? Then a few years later, "Straight Outta Compton" is nominated for an Oscar. That was for screenwriting. True, but what I'm talking about is, don't worry about the critics. You make a good point, Bobby. My mom's is a critic. There's only one way to silence critics. You know what? It's extremely hard to make a movie now-a-days. - I'm talking about winning the Taste-Off! - Oh! If the people accept my food, then they will accept my message. That'll show my mother that she's wrong about my food truck being a bad image. Well, there you go, cuzzo. You got it. You got it. You got it, bro. What's up, Green? It's hotter than a motherfucker out here. Yeah. You ain't lying. What Tray's mom said got me thinking. Maybe there's more I could be doing now to make up for all the bullshit I did back in the day. You still thinking about beef with ol' boy? They pushing folks out their homes that lived there all their lives. Like your mom. It ain't right. What else can we do? Got to be something. These buildings got history, man. Matter of fact, the one he's tearing down, Ol' Dirty Bastard grew up there. - Say word. - Word. Word. All right, everybody, everybody, attention. Me and this gentleman to the left of me, we have a petition, okay? - Petition! - Petition. - Petition for what? - You know what we gonna do? We gonna turn this building into a historical landmark. We gonna shut your construction down! - Come on! - Landmark? What are you talking about? It's a dump. What you mean, what I'm talking about, it's a dump? Let me te... See? If you sign this petition right here, you're protecting the birthplace of Ol' Dirty Bastard. Who's Ol' Dirty Bastard? O.D.B. - Who? - Who? - Come on, son. Dirt McGirt. - Mm-hmm. - Big Baby Jesus. - Well... - Dirt Dog? - Uh-huh. - Ason Unique? - Whoo-hoo! Yeah! What is that, voodoo? No, it ain't no voodoo! That's not voo... That's Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang forever! All right. What do you think? That's not bad for our first project together. Well, we only had, what, 10 fights over it. Maybe fighting is a part of our process. Like Kanye and Jay-Z. Well, I'm sure Kanye never threw bolts of fabric at Jay-Z. Mm. Oh! All right. Well, let me get out of here. - Enjoy the, uh, block party. - Mm-hmm. - Mwah. Mwah. - Mwah. Mwah. Bye, boo. - Hey, Faith. - Hey! - How are you? - Good. Good. I-I'm gonna change and take a shower. It is hot as hell out there. Mm-hmm. - Thank goodness for the left nipple. - Ah! Yeah. - Thank goodness for the right nipple. - Aah! Thank goodness for that belly button. Uh-huh. Ooh! Thank goodness for that ear. Oh, gosh. You know what, babe? This is actually not that, uh, comfortable. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Neither was wearing stilettos with the French maid outfit, but I didn't complain. - Did I? - No. - Get with the program. - All right. Thank goodness for the sternum. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Are you really gonna do, like, every... Ohh! Man, according to this weather app, it's 101 degrees. Damn! Yo, instead of always downloading apps and letting the other man get paid, - why don't we start making our own? - Uh-huh. - I agree with you fully there, brother Fels. - Hmm. Like, instead of using Waze, we need to come up with, like, a black version and call it Blaze, right? And not only does it keep you out of the reach of the police, but it gets you there 10 minutes earlier to account for C.P. Time. - I'm feeling that. - Give me that. Or, like, you know what I'm saying? Like a-a-a "Candy Crush" but it's got Jolly Ranchers and Now and Laters. - Oh, a-a-and the Hot Chew. - Can't y'all think of something other than the black version of things that already exist? We supposed to be innovators, like the Egyptians, like the Moors. - The Wakandans. - Whoo! Wakanda forever. What's going on, fellas? - Bobby! - Hey! We need you all to sign this petition. - Oh, yeah. I'm in. - Who we saving? Rainforest? Whales? Those little white seals that they make coats from? You ain't talking about the baby seals on... on the commercial? All of them little seals. Don't get me started again. - They're cute. - There you go. Man, y'all niggas don't even know what y'all signing. All right. But I signed it already. - It's too late. - Yeah, me too. Yo, it's Old Man Potter down the way trying to turn that building on the corner into condos that people can't afford, yo. That old rat-infested building? - I'm glad to see him do something with it. - Shit. I can't believe you're taking his side right now. Me and him, we're property owners, so him renovating that building is good for my house. That's real selfish, Mullins. - Look, we got to stick together. - Oh, we're gonna stick together? Okay, so the next time my mortgage is due, you're gonna help me with that? Huh? What? Yeah, I-I didn't think so. You're a cold piece of work. Look, y'all can't stop progress. And as far as those seals that you're talking about on TV... - Yeah? - ... they look delicious. - Oh, come on! - Oh, man. Mak... Making me hungry. Shit, I'm gonna... I'm gonna eat up the seal meat. Something's wrong with you, Mullins. All right, listen! Listen! Please, everybody pass it around. We want to protect historic Brooklyn from people like... like that dude who doesn't want to share with everyone! - Now, that's good for Brooklyn. - What? - This isn't Manhattan! - What about the community? They can move somewhere else. Calm down! Wait a... Calm down! Hey! Stop! Shut up! Okay? We're here to have fun, not fight! Gene, take a breather. Linda, take a walk. - Talk to you later, Linda. - All right, boo. Everybody else, go on about your business. Bobby, you can't be out here starting trouble, man. Yeah. People have a lot of feelings about this. You got to be careful. But I hear you. Wu-Tang Clan is my shit. That's why I rock with you. Officer Dobbs, baby, cool. Baby, Wu-Tang forever. Yeah. Just don't break the law. Ladies and gentlemen, the votes are in, and the winner for the "Flavors of Brooklyn" Taste-Off is... Last Meal on Wheels. - Give it up. - What? Yes! Congratulations, brother. - Come on up here. - Yeah! Come on! - Yes! - Yes, baby! Yes! Yes! - Hold this for me, Bobby. - Gotcha. Yo, what up, Brooklyn? Let me tell you something, man. My food truck is personal. It's about redemption, about life. It's about love. Take my Radiator Chicken, for instance. The right hand is the Kool-Aid powder used in the brine. It's tart, abrasive, but yet colorful. The left hand is the jelly packages from Church's Chicken I used in the marinade after the brine has been sitting there for hours. It's added later, and it comes in fancier packages. But my story's about Brooklyn. Static. Who will win? Too much of the right hand, this chicken will be salty, dry, and mad as hell. Too much of the left hand and it's gonna be soft, boring, and can't take the heat from the radiator. But you put them together, and it's gonna be something delicious. Love. Thanks for coming out. Uh, well, all righty, then. Give it up for your winner, everybody. - Give it up! - Last Meal on Wheels. Give them some. Hey. What in the world? Oh, come on, son! Yo, they got to do this right now? - There it is. Static. - See? See, that's what I'm talking about right there. That's why we got to shut them down. Oh, yeah. They gonna feel our presence. - No, what you talking about? - No, no, no, no. I got... I see the violent look in your eyes, man. - What you talking about? - I g... I got this, cuzzo. - Wait a minute. - Don't worry about it. - I got this. - Where you going? Make them show us respect! Green Eyes, could you get my keys from him? That's my keys and my truck. Bobby, you need to sit down somewhere. Come on, Bobby. Bobby, come on, man! Stop acting crazy! - I got this! - Gets so angry. ♪ Fight the power ♪ Bobby, what are you doing? Bobby! Yo, watch it! Move the truck! - We ain't going nowhere, dawg. - Bobby. Bobby. Get this monstrosity out of here! - We ain't going nowhere! - Bobby, no. - This is our block party and our neighborhood! - Bobby! - Come on, man! - That's right, damn it! - You better move the truck... - Come on, Bobby. ... or else. - Come on! - Or else what, man?! Oh, you ain't gonna do nothing, and you know it! Shut the music off now! I ain't shutting nothing down, man! - You're not shutting it down? - It's a block party. You're not shutting the music off? I'm gonna shut it off for you! Man, you ain't gonna do nothing. Come on, Bobby. Come on, Bobby. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Back off! Back off! Whoa, whoa. Back off! - No! - No, no, no! Come on! Come on, man! Come on, man! - Come on, man! - No, no! - Oh! - Come on, man. Ah! What are you doing?! Yo, man, you lucky you got that pipe, man! No! No, man! Now we put you out of business. And we didn't need a petition. I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker! You mother... Get off me! No! No! No! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Dobbs, you know him. You know him! Do something! Do something! Please! Do something! Do something! - That's enough! - Get off me! - That's enough! Come on! - Get off me! Aah! No! Green! Green, pick it up! Get up, man! Come on! Hurry up. Come on! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Shit! Shit. Tray. Tray, what are you doing? Tray. Tray, don't! Cuzzo. Tray. - Cuzzo! - Don't. Don't do this, Tray. - Tray, you don't want to go back to jail! - Cuzzo! Don't do this! Tray, don't. Tray, don't! Tray, the kids! Tray! You have children now! They need you. We have kids, Tray. They need you. We need you. Tray! Don't! We need you. Rough night, huh? Uh, thank you, Shay. Ohh. It all happened so fast. Even when I do right, I end up losing. The truck can be replaced. That's what insurance is for. Thank God the policy's in Josh's name. He gets those white-boy rates. I messed up again, Shay. Just when I started to make something of myself, I end up losing. What if that's just the way it is with me? What if I'm always gonna lose? Don't say that. Why not? You've seen it before. Some people just can't get out of their own way. Tray, when you first got out of prison, I thought you'd be back in there within two weeks. You've grown so much. You've gone from someone I hated to someone I consider to be my friend. If you can overcome that, you can overcome anything. Thanks. Oh, don't flatter yourself. This is morning wood. That's all it is. They arrested your friend. Least he's alive. Thank you. Cost me my job. They're gonna fire you? Nah. Gonna be forced to quit. They can't do that. Who's gonna come if I call for backup? I'm risking my own safety staying on. Damn. How are things gonna change if we start punishing the police for doing what they're supposed to do? Your guess is as good as mine. Man, I should have eaten there when I had the chance. It was good. It was good, Tray. Hey, Dobbs. You owe me $2.50 for that free food I gave you. Fuck you, Tray. Love you, too. Wondering when you was gonna bring your trifling, food-truck-burning ass back here. I don't want to hear it, Mullins. Well, you need to hear this. It's from the Department of Corrections. Came yesterday. Notice of time served? Your time's up here. You got two weeks to find you a new place to live. Everybody up. - Everybody up. - Oh, come on, dawg. Time to wake up from your dreams and face your jacked-up reality. Before you say anything, just hear me out.
