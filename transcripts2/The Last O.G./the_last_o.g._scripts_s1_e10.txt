We been fighting a lot, and Josh didn't come home last night, and I don't know what to do. He's not answering my calls. He's not answering my texts or nothing! [SOBBING] I'll find him for you. All right? I know this city like the back of my hand. Now, I can't vouch for this weird-ass white boy and what he gonna be doing when I do find him. But I'm gonna go get his ass, and I'm gonna bring him home to you. I gotta make this thing right before it's too late.

I said give me one more, please. - Thank you. - Look, you reached your limit. You need to settle up and get out of here. I've reached my limit? I've reached my limit? You know my limit? - You think you know my limit? - Hey, hey, don't start any trouble. I'm not starting trouble. You don't know what trouble is, okay? I'll tell you what trouble is. Look at that. Do you see that tat right there, bro? Do you see it? That's from Burma... Fuckin' Burma. Have you ever been to Burma? No? You need to put your shirt on and get out of here. Stop pointing at me. That's rude. I took part in a Muay Thai fighting circuit in Phuket. I said I want you outta here! I don't care! Come out here and do it, then! Come out here and fight me. You heard the man, Josh. You? What do you want? I don't know much about the Narc-Anon program, but I know getting wasted in a bar ain't one of the 12 steps. - And fuck the 12 steps. - Come on, man. You don't want to fall back into those old ways. Ah. You talking about heroin? That's a great idea, Tray. Hey, does anybody got any smack? Maybe a little bit of "H"? I'm a junkie, so I'm looking for some good heroin. Or some bad heroin, it doesn't matter. I can use good or bad heroin. - It does the same thing. - Cut off. Have a seat. I drink what I want. Oh, this ain't about drinking, man. This is about cutting off that bullshit coming out of your mouth. I'm s... Are you telling me to shut up? No, I'm telling you to shut the fuck up.

They're your flesh and blood. My k... my kids... my kids are your flesh and blood. I'm so scared I'm gonna lose them. [SIGHS] I don't want to lose them. I don't want to lose them. How'd you even find me here? I wanted to help, so I took a chance. I called your credit-card company. I pretended I was you and I tracked your purchases. I even answered some of those secret questions they have for you. You did that for me? No... I did it for Shannon... and I did it for the kids. Our kids. Then I went and bought me a pair of new Air Jordans. That's fair. Not that it matters, but how much? Thank you. Next customer in line, please. Uh, I actually just need y'all's bathroom key. Oh, bathrooms are for customers only. Oh, that's fair play. What can I get that's cheap? How about them mints right there? Uh, those are "After Java" mints, and they're $3. $3 for mints?

And then he wanted you to dime on me, thinking if he got us both out the way, he'd be the big man on the block. CLYDE: Look, I got plans. I got skills. Everybody say that I'm stupid, but I'm not. And when you got busted... Yo, the truth is, I got scared.
