[ HISSES ] CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪ IT'S COOL TO FINALLY BE HERE ON THE GROUND. THE YUKON HAS BEEN SO GREAT AND FOR ME AS A BUSINESS, AND THE BIG DOWNSIDE TO THAT IS THAT YOU'VE ONLY GOT A VERY SHORT SEASON TO MAKE MONEY. AND IN A COUNTRY LIKE AUSTRALIA, MAN, YOU'VE GOT 12 MONTHS A YEAR TO MINE. THERE'S A HUGE HISTORY OF MINING IN AUSTRALIA. IT'S GOT BIGGEST GOLD RESERVES IN THE WORLD, AND AUSTRALIA'S GOLD PRODUCTION IS HIGHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING FOR IT RIGHT NOW, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND SOME FOR OURSELVES. ♪ Narrator: VETERANS OF THE 1849 CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH STRUCK GOLD IN VICTORIA IN 1851, SPARKING A SERIES OF GOLD RUSHES ACROSS AUSTRALIA. FOR THE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS, PARKER WILL EXPLORE THESE HISTORIC REGIONS HUNTING FOR GOOD GROUND AND GOLD... ♪ ...BEGINNING IN VICTORIA'S GOLDEN TRIANGLE. PARKER AND HIS TEAM WILL TRAVEL NORTH TO PALMER RIVER, THEN WEST TO THE KIMBERLEYS, AND FINALLY SOUTH TO THE GOLD FIELDS OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, TRAVELING 6,000 MILES OVER DIFFICULT, DROUGHT-AFFECTED TERRAIN. Parker: IN THE 1800s, HOW MUCH DIRT WERE THEY MOVING A DAY? HOW MUCH DIRT ARE WE CAPABLE OF MOVING? YOU LOOK AT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE GOT NOW, AND THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITY STILL HERE. ♪ WHOA! [BLEEP] FRED. TACTICAL DRIVING SKILLS. Narrator: JOINING PARKER ON THE TRAIL FOR A SECOND TIME IS FORMER SPECIAL FORCES MEDIC FRED LEWIS. YOU KNOW, PARKER BROUGHT ME HERE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S SAFE, AND I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME CHALLENGES HERE IN AUSTRALIA, YOU KNOW? IT'S A REALLY HOT CONTINENT. WE'RE TALKING TEMPERATURES ABOVE 115, 120 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. AND THEN THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT WANT TO KILL YOU, SO ADVENTURE ASIDE, WE THINK WE'VE GOT OUR HANDS FULL. Narrator: DOCUMENTING EVERY STEP OF THE JOURNEY IS TWO-TIME "PARKER'S TRAIL" CAMERAMAN AND CLOSE FRIEND DANNY ETHERIDGE. THESE TRAILS ARE NOT EASY THINGS TO FILM. I'M IN AMONGST IT. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I'M NEARER THE EMOTION, I'M NEARER IT ALL HAPPENING, AND IT'S HAPPENING TO ME TOO, SO I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO COME THROUGH ON CAMERA. Narrator: THE FINAL MEMBER OF THE TEAM IS 24-YEAR-OLD GOLD PROSPECTOR TYLER MAHONEY. SO I'M A FOURTH GENERATION GOLD MINER FROM WESTERN AUSTRALIA. I'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AND ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I'M LUCKY THAT MY FAMILY HAS HAD GOOD SUCCESS. SO I KNOW FIRSTHAND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY IN AUSTRALIA TO FIND GOLD. I'M HOPING TO USE MY CONTACTS AND MY LOCAL PROSPECTING KNOWLEDGE TO HELP FIND A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FOR PARKER. AND IF EVERYTHING GOES TO PLAN, IT CAN LEAD TO SOMETHING FOR ME IN THE FUTURE. THERE SHE IS. Parker: HOWDY, STRANGER. HEY GUYS. WHAT'S UP? I DON'T KNOW PARKER VERY WELL, AND HE'S GOING TO BE QUITE CRITICAL OF WHERE I TAKE HIM AND WHAT I DO. I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO BE FEELING THE PRESSURE. ♪ Narrator: SINCE AUSTRALIA'S FIRST MAJOR GOLD RUSH IN 1851, NEARLY 2,500 TONS OF GOLD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN VICTORIA'S GOLDEN TRIANGLE. GEOLOGISTS ESTIMATE MILLIONS OF TONS ARE STILL WAITING TO BE FOUND. Parker: YOU'VE BROUGHT US TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. I DID IT FOR REASON THOUGH. COME WITH ME. I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF THE CAR. -WHAT THE HELL -- -[BLEEP] OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] [BLEEP] SO THIS IS WHERE THE "WELCOME STRANGER" NUGGET WAS FOUND. SO THAT WAS THE BIGGEST NUGGET IN THE WORLD. SO IT WAS PRETTY BLOODY BIG. IS THAT MADE OUT OF GOLD? OKAY, SO THIS IS A REPLICA, BUT IT'S THE EXACT REPLICA, AND THAT'S HOW BIG IT WAS. OH, MAN. THAT'S [BLEEP] NUTS. IT'S COOL, HEY? HEY, FRED, GO THROW IT ON THE HOOD. -YEAH. -I THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LIFT IT. I'LL GRAB A BLANKET IF YOU WANT TO CHUCK IT ON THE HOOD. OH, MY [BLEEP], LOOK AT THAT. OOP. DROPPED IT. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. Danny: THAT IS MONSTROUS. -HOLY [BLEEP]. -PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, EH? -Danny: WOW. -CAN YOU IMAGINE FINDING THAT? SO OBVIOUSLY THIS AREA'S BEEN HAMMERED NOW, BUT VICTORIA IS KNOWN FOR THEIR BIG GOLD AND A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. Narrator: THE ORIGINAL "WELCOME STRANGER" WAS MELTED INTO GOLD BARS WORTH NEARLY 3 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS TODAY. WHY ARE WE STANDING HERE THERE? LET'S GO FIND SOME GOLD. SO WHAT IS THE PLAN? I'M HOPING THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY, LIKE, GOT SOME GROUND AROUND TO PROSPECT. SO I'VE SET SOMETHING UP WITH A GUY NAMED RAYMO, AND HE'S GOT SOME MASSIVE SHAFTS OUT IN A PROPERTY. OF COURSE, THE OTHER BIG THING -- I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD MAYBE FIND, LIKE, A LITTLE TEST TROMMEL OR A LITTLE SCREEN DECK OR SOMETHING. OKAY. PROBABLY GOT LIKE 8 OR 10 GRAND. I'VE GOT SOME CONTACTS. I'M SURE WE COULD TRY AND MAYBE BUY ONE. EARN YOUR WAGES HERE. DON'T WORRY. Danny: OKAY. ARE WE OUT OF THIS, SCHNABEL? WE ARE OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT, FRED. I'M PUMPED. YEAH. Narrator: TYLER AND FRED HEAD SOUTH IN SEARCH OF A MINI WASH PLANT SO PARKER CAN TEST ANY GROUND THEY FIND FOR GOLD. LET'S SEE IF I CAN DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD HERE. STAY ON THE LEFT. STAY ON THE LEFT. PARKER AND DANNY ARE DRIVING EIGHT MILES TO GERMAN GULLY TO PROSPECT A HARD ROCK MINE FROM THE ORIGINAL VICTORIA GOLD RUSH. THERE'RE TONS OF HARD ROCK IN AUSTRALIA, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M REALLY UNFAMILIAR WITH. THE HARD ROCK GAME IS... IT'S ALWAYS INTRIGUED ME. WOULD THAT BE AN OPTION OVER HERE? IT'S NOT AN OPTION IN THE YUKON, IT COULD BE AN OPTION OVER HERE. YEAH. IT'S NOT AN OPTION IN THE YUKON BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THESE SOURCES ARE. ♪ Narrator: OLD TIMERS RISKED THEIR LIVES IN UNDERGROUND SHAFTS AT GERMAN GULLY, CHISELING NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF GOLD FROM HARD ROCK. Danny: THAT MUST BE RAYMO. YOU LOOK SERIOUS. I CERTAINLY DO. HOW YOU GOING, BRO? PLEASED TO MEET YOU. -I'M PARKER. -I'M RAYMO. -NICE TO MEET YOU. -LIKEWISE. WE'VE GOT YOU A KIT OVER THERE, BRO. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS SADDLE UP AND WE'LL SHOW YOU THE ROPES, AND WE'LL GET YOU GOING DOWN THESE WINDS HERE. HOW FAR DOWN THERE IS IT? PROBABLY ABOUT 20 METERS OR SO DEEP. 60 FEET? YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL DOWN THAT. WELL, NO, DEFINITELY NOT. AND THAT'S WHY WE USE... [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHY WE USE ALL THIS SAFETY EQUIPMENT. COULD BE IN FOR ANYTHING. COULD BE A SNAKE, IT COULD BE, YOU KNOW, ROCKFALLS COMING DOWN FROM THE BACK -- IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

WELL, YEAH, ESPECIALLY GOLD. LET'S HOPE THERE'S GOLD. ALL RIGHT, SO YOU JUST STEP IN THROUGH HERE. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. Danny: OH, I LOVE THIS. AND THEN OVER TO THAT SIDE. THIS IS PERFECT. DANNY'S BEEN TRYING TO KILL ME FOR YEARS. I'M NOT NERVOUS. [ LAUGHS ] SO YOU USE THOSE AS YOUR BRAKES PRETTY MUCH. AND IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ANYTHING HAPPENS, JUST LOOK OUT WITH THE LEVER. -SO IF HE FAINTS RAYMO. -YEAH, HE MIGHT. -HE SEES A SNAKE OR WHATEVER... -YEAH. -...AND FAINTS... -YEP. -...HE'S SAFE? -YEAH, MATE. [ LAUGHS ] THIS IS ONE EXPERIENCE, BRO, THAT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FORGET. [ LAUGHS ] Parker: I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. LIKE, IF I SEE A BIG [BLEEP] SPIDER DOWN THERE, ESPECIALLY IF I'M ATTACHED TO A ROPE, I MIGHT LOSE MY [BLEEP]. BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET IN THERE AND FIND SOMETHING COOL. ♪ THEY MUST HAVE GOT A BIT OF GOLD OUT OF THERE BECAUSE THERE'S AN OLD MINE DOOR THERE. THEY NORMALLY DON'T HAVE MINE DOORS ON THEM, YOU KNOW, BUT THIS ONE MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE PROFITABLE BACK IN ITS DAY. YOU'LL START CHECKING SOME OF THESE QUARTZ VEINS, ALL THESE REEFS UP AND AROUND HERE. Narrator: IN HARD ROCK MINING, PROSPECTORS EXTRACT GOLD FROM QUARTZ VEINS THAT RUN INTO THE GROUND. TO FOLLOW THESE VEINS, OLD TIMERS USING ONLY BASIC HAND TOOLS AND EXPLOSIVES DUG UNDERGROUND MINE SHAFTS. IT WAS DANGEROUS WORK, COSTING MANY OF THEM THEIR LIVES. Raymo: AMAZING, ISN'T IT? I'M JUST WAITING TO STICK MY HEAD IN A HOLE THAT HAS SOME MASSIVE [BLEEP] SPIDERS IN IT AND I'M GOING TO FREAK THE [BLEEP] OUT. AREN'T WE LOOKING FOR GOLD? YOU'RE FORGETTING ABOUT THE GOLD.

I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'VE HAD SOME GOOD DAYS IN THE PAST, HAVEN'T YOU? I HAVE MANY GOOD DAYS IN THE PAST. YEAH. YEAH. ROUGH ONES AND GOOD ONES, AND I'VE GOT A SAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE GOOD WHEN THINGS GO WELL. ♪ -Fred: OH, WOW. -Ian: BUT THESE... OH! DID YOU FIND THOSE? HEY, PARKER, THESE ARE THE TWO LARGEST NUGGETS I HAVE EVER FOUND. THIS ONE COMES IN AT 2.4 KILOGRAMS AND THIS ONE IS 1.4 KILOGRAMS. -Fred: HOLY COW. -DO YOU MIND IF I HOLD ONE? 77 OUNCES AND 46 OUNCES. -WHOA! -THAT'S AMAZING. Fred: THIS IS LIKE THE SHINIEST GOLD I'VE EVER SEEN. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT? YEAH. Parker: YOU WOULDN'T TAKE LESS THAN A QUARTER MILLION FOR THIS? Ian: PREMIUM WOULD DEFINITELY BE A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS. YOU KNOW, IT'S WORTH SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THERE'S A RETIREMENT FUND. YEAH, EXACTLY. ♪ TYLER'S DONE A GREAT JOB OF GETTING US ACCESS TO THIS PIECE OF GROUND WITH IAN, AND HE'S PRETTY KEEN TO SHOW US, LIKE, THAT IT IS VIABLE AND GET SOME GOLD OUT OF THE GROUND. BUT WITH THESE BREAKDOWNS, IT'S JUST NOT REALLY BEEN POSSIBLE. YEAH, I'VE GOT KIND OF MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT SEEING AND THOSE TWO BIG NUGGETS, LIKE, IT'S SUPER COOL, BUT THEY DIDN'T COME OFF THIS PIECE OF GROUND, RIGHT? AND... I... REALLY NEED TO TEST IAN'S GROUND AND SEE WHAT'S VIABLE HERE. ♪ ♪ WERE YOU INFESTED WITH ANTS? I HAD LIKE SEVEN I HAD TO KILL. YOU MURDERER. TO ME, IT WAS THE WINDIEST NIGHT IN HISTORY LAST NIGHT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BLOW OVER. MATE, I GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH A BIT OF TREE PANIC. SHOULD WE GO FIND SOME BIG NUGS? ALL RIGHT. Narrator: PARKER AND HIS TEAM ARE ON AN EIGHT-WEEK MISSION IN AUSTRALIA TO FIND VIABLE GROUND HE CAN MINE IN THE OFF SEASON WHEN THE YUKON FREEZES UP. THERE'S NO WAY TO FEASIBLY, COMFORTABLY, AND CLEANLY POOP OUT HERE. IF YOU JUST GET YOUR PICK OUT, YOU CAN SIT ON YOUR PICK, AND THEN YOU JUST PUT YOUR BUM OVER. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME IMAGINING SITTING ON A PICK. SO WE'VE DUG OUR HOLE. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY HIGH PICK, OKAY. SO, OUR PICKS ARE A LOT SHORTER THAN THIS. BUT YEAH, THEN YOU SIT ON IT, AND THEN THERE'S YOUR SEAT. HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CONVERSATION. -LET'S GO FIND SOME GOLD. -YEAH. LET'S DO IT. ♪ Narrator: LOCAL MINER IAN HOLLAND IS HOPING TO SELL HIS LEASE, BUT A BROKEN EXCAVATOR IS PREVENTING PARKER FROM TESTING THE GROUND. MY GREATEST FEAR IS THAT WE COME AWAY FROM HERE WITHOUT REALLY HAVING ANY IDEA ABOUT HOW GOOD THIS GROUND IS, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YEAH. THAT'D BE THE WORST THING. Narrator: UNABLE TO SOURCE SPARE PARTS QUICKLY, IAN BRINGS IN A NEW EXCAVATOR. Ian: WHERE WE'RE PLAYING ON MINING NOW WAS WHERE A LOT OF GOOD GOLD WAS FOUND IN THE PAST BY THE OLD MINERS. IT'S WHERE THEY CONCENTRATED ON MAINLY AND GOT THE BETTER GOLD. SO I'M CONFIDENT IT'S GOING TO GO REALLY WELL. ARE YOU HAPPY TO HAVE A GO AT CARVING? WOW. LET'S SEE IF PARKER CAN'T BREAK YOUR EXCAVATOR. [ LAUGHS ] Ian: LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOUR DRIVE. -I'VE HEARD YOU'RE A GUN. -ALL RIGHT. SEE HOW THIS GOES. ♪ PROBABLY JUST GO BACK MAYBE FIVE FEET AND JUST SWEEP THAT UP IN FRONT OF THE MACHINE. IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. ♪ SO, WHERE PARKER'S FROM, HE'S USED TO CHASING FINE GOLD AND RUNNING IT THROUGH BIG MACHINES. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE GOLD GETS DAMAGED. BUT HERE, THE GOLD CAN HAVE QUITE A GOOD PREMIUM, SO IT'S GOT TO BE DONE PROPERLY TO ENSURE YOU DO NOT DAMAGE THAT GOLD. YEAH, I'M DEFINITELY NOT USED TO NEEDING TO, LIKE, BE CAREFUL ABOUT DIGGING. LIKE, IN THE YUKON, IT'S JUST BLOW AND GO AND NOT WORRY ABOUT A THING, REALLY. ♪ SEE THIS COLORATION OF THE BLUE? MM-HMM. THAT'S NOT NORMAL. AND THIS HERE, THIS IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY. THAT'S TIMBER. THAT'S A PIECE OF WOOD. Parker: GOTCHA. HERE WE GO. SO, THE OLD MINERS HAVE MINED ALONG HERE, SO WE'LL DEFINITELY PERSIST WITH THIS. THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANY AT FINDING SOMETHING. ♪ Narrator: IAN RELIES ON FINDING LARGE, COLLECTIBLE NUGGETS TO SELL AT PREMIUM PRICE. PARKER'S PREFERRED MINING TECHNIQUE RELIES ON GROUND RICH IN FINE GOLD, LIKE THE YUKON, WHERE A STEADY SOURCE EARNS HIM A PROFIT. ♪ THESE OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO CATCH THE SMALLER THINGS. SMALLER STUFF. YEAH. Tyler: I FEEL A BIT OF PRESSURE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I'M MEANT TO BE THE ONE SHOWING GOOD GROUND, SO I'M REALLY HOPING THERE IS GOLD IN THAT DIRT. Narrator: TYLER AND FRED SET UP THE TROMMEL TO CATCH ANY FINE GOLD FROM ONE YARD OF SAMPLE DIRT. -YOU READY? -LET'S DO IT. WELL, I'M HOPEFULLY -- THIS THING STARTED LIKE A DEAD HORSE LAST TIME WE TRIED TO START IT, SO WE'RE KIND OF HOPING IT FIRES UP THE FIRST TIME. [ CRANKING ] ♪ [ MOTOR STARTS, RUMBLES ] YAY! [ RUMBLING ] NICE WORK. WE'VE GOT THE TROMMEL WORKING, THANK GOD. SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE PAY DIRT THROUGH. I'M JUST HAVING A LOOK AT IT AND I'M SEEING THIS, WHICH IS A BIG CLUSTER OF CLAY, LIKE A CONGLOMERATE, FULL OF ROCKS. CAN YOU SEE HOW WEATHERED AWAY THEY ARE? THIS IS A VERY GOOD GOLD INDICATOR AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING PAY DIRT THROUGH THIS AREA. ♪ Narrator: THE PAY DIRT IS FED INTO THE PLANT THROUGH THE HOPPER... ♪ ...AND THEN ENTERS THE ROTATING DRUM, WHERE JETS OF WATER WASH IT, SEPARATING THE WORTHLESS MATERIAL FROM THE HEAVIER GOLD, WHICH FALLS INTO THE SLUICES BELOW. SO, THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS, WILL PARKER BE HAPPY? THAT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION. ♪ [ DETECTOR WHINING ] ♪ [ WHINES LOUDER ] OH. [ WHINING CONTINUES ] WE'VE GOT SOMETHING. YOU SEE WHAT THIS. THAT'S THE SOUND, RIGHT? IAN? YEAH, THAT SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. IF WE MOVE THAT LOOSE STUFF... [ WHINING CONTINUES ] WELL, POP THE DETECTOR DOWN AND RUN EACH HALF OVER IT SEPARATELY. YEAH. SO, I'M THINKING WE'VE GOT A BIT HERE. [ WHINES ] -HEY, HEY, HERE WE GO. -YEAH, REALLY? -YEAH. -IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED. YES! Ian: THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR, BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS LARGE AS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. BEAUTIFUL GOLD. HELL OF A LOT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE DO IN THE YUKON. YOU COULD GO A MONTH AND NOT FIND A SINGLE PIECE OF GOLD, AND WORK 12 HOURS A DAY AND THEN FIND A HUNDRED-OUNCE NUGGET AND YOU JUST MADE A QUARTER-MILLION DOLLARS IN A MONTH, BUT YOU SPENT 29 DAYS FINDING NOTHING. IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE LOTTERY OF GOLD MINING RIGHT HERE. I'M GOING TO, LIKE, LOSE EVERYTHING I'VE EVER MADE TRYING TO HUNT GOLD NUGGETS IN AUSTRALIA. ♪ ♪ -LET'S GO CHECK THIS THING OUT. -OH, NO WAY. I'VE NEVER SEEN A CONVEYOR BELT LIKE THIS. [BLEEP] CRUDE. SO THIS WAS A LOW-BUDGET OUTFIT THAT DID THIS. OH, YOU CAN TELL THAT FOR SURE? THAT'S THE REAR END OF A PICKUP. AH, YOU'RE RIGHT. [BLEEP], IT IS. SO THEY JUST HAD A MOTOR HERE AND DROVE A DIFF TO RUN THE TROMMEL. Narrator: THIS AUSTRALIAN DRAGLINE DREDGE NEAR IAN HOLLAND'S CLAIM WAS BUILT FROM REPURPOSED CAR AND TRUCK PARTS BY OLD-TIMER GEORGE HAYWARD. FROM 1958 UNTIL 1984, HE DRAGGED THE DREDGE WITH THIS CRANE UP AND DOWN THE CREEK, BUT FOUND LITTLE GOLD, AND ABANDONED IT HERE. Parker: SEND TONY A PHOTO. MAYBE HE'LL COME WANT TO MOVE TO THE YUKON. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ ONE MORE. WE GOT ONE MORE BUCKET TO DRIVE THROUGH, AND THEN WE'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER CHECK, BUT EVERYTHING'S LOOKING GREAT RIGHT NOW. Narrator: PARKER AND HIS TEAM ARE IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA, LOOKING FOR A VIABLE MINE WITH A MORE CONSISTENT FINE GOLD. DOES IT SEEM ALL RIGHT? YEAH. YEP. BACK TO DOING CLEANUPS, FRED. IT'S A LOT WARMER THAN THE LAST ONE YOU DID, HUH? THIS IS FANTASTIC. I'LL TAKE THIS ANY DAY. Narrator: THE MATS BENEATH THE SLUICES HOLD THE GOLD-RICH CONCENTRATE. THE TEAM WASH THEM IN BUCKETS, AND THEN PARKER USES A PAN TO SEPARATE THE GOLD. FIRST PAN OF PARKER'S TRAIL, AUSTRALIA. ♪ WHAT'S THE MOST YOU'VE SEEN IN A PAN WHERE YOU'VE TAKEN IT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CUT? OH, GOD, I'VE HAD SOME KILLER PANS IN THE PAST. -SERIOUS? -YEAH.

I GUESS THE TROMMEL WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE NEVER PANNED GOLD THAT WAS THAT NICE LOOKING. I WISH I HAD SOME GROUND LIKE THIS IN THE YUKON. Narrator: ONE YARD OF DIRT HAS PRODUCED $40 OF GOLD. THAT'S TWICE AS RICH AS THE GROUND PARKER MINES IN THE YUKON. THIS IS THE BEST START TO A TRAIL. ♪ IT IS SOME PRETTY GOOD GROUND, AND IT'S UNREAL. LIKE, IT'S TOO BAD WE DIDN'T FIND ANY MASSIVE NUGGETS. I AM SO BLOODY HAPPY WITH IT. I WAS GETTING SO STRESSED ALL DAY. THE TROMMEL WAS MY GUY, AND THIS GROUND WAS KIND OF MY GUY, SO I'M GLAD FOR PARKER TO FIND THOSE GOLD FLAKES AND HE GET EXCITED. TOOK A WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS. Narrator: IAN HAS PROVED HIS GROUND HAS GOOD GOLD. NOW PARKER AND HIS TEAM MUST MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION. HEY GUYS. HEY, WHAT'S UP? HELLO. DID YOU GUYS HAVE FUN? YEAH. A BLAST. HAD A GREAT TIME. YEAH, IT WAS GOOD. HOW ABOUT YOU? IT'S PRETTY COOL. IT'S PRETTY NICE TO BE HERE AND HAVE A LEGITIMATE OPTION. I COULD SPEND SOME TIME HERE. A LANDOWNER THAT INVITES US TO COME MINE WITH HIM, FINDS MASSIVE GOLDEN NUGGETS, MAKES HIS OWN BEER. Danny: YEAH, PRETTY COOL. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME BEETS MADE YOU A BEER? YEAH. TONY BEETS NEVER OFFERS ME FREE BEER. IT'D BE CRAZY TO STAY HERE. -OH, YEAH? -YEAH. 100% CRAZY. YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER THAN THIS? IT WOULD BE SILLY NOT TO TRY. ♪ I'VE BEEN ON THOSE GOLD FIELDS FOR 15 YEARS, AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOLD JUST LIKE THIS COME OUT, SO VICTORIA'S GOOD, WE'D BE CRAZY NOT TO TRY THE OTHER SPOTS. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE SAYING THAT WHEN IT'S 125 DEGREES. I THINK YOU'D BE SAYING THAT IF WE FIND A LOT MORE GOLD. ARE WE GOING TO? YEAH, I THINK WE WILL. I'M CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO. -YOU THINK WE WILL? -I KNOW WE WILL. ♪ WELL, IAN'S OVER THERE JUST PACKING HIS TRUCK UP. I'M GOING TO HAVE A QUICK CHAT WITH HIM. OKAY. YEAH, SURE.

I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO FIND GOLD AT THE OTHER SPOTS. -YOU THINK SO? -OH, 100%. 100%. TYLER SAID SOMETHING TO ME THE OTHER DAY. SHE SAID SHE'S STRUGGLING TO BE IMPRESSED BY THESE NUGGETS. -WHAT? -YEAH, SHE SAID THAT. I'M NOT GOING TO LIE. JUST I'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOLD IN MY TIME. THAT DOES TELL US SOMETHING, HUH? WE'RE ON THE FIRST LEG OF QUITE A LONG TRIP AROUND THE COUNTRY, BUT I GENUINELY AM PRETTY INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU'VE GOT GOING ON HERE. OKAY. AND IF IT WERE SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED TO REVISIT, IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR THAT? WELL, I'D BE HAPPY TO MINE WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU, IAN. Ian: IF PARKER WAS TO RING ME IN SIX WEEKS' TIME, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT PHONE CALL. IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL GOOD AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PARKER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. IT WAS A PLEASURE, TYLER. Tyler: IT WAS A GOOD START TO THE TRIP. IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS. I GUESS IT WAS KIND OF MY FIRST TEST, BUT FOR ME, WE REALLY DO NEED TO SEE THE REST OF AUSTRALIA. THIS WAS GOOD, BUT I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOME OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD BE BETTER. Parker: FIRST REAL OPPORTUNITY IN YEARS OUTSIDE OF THE YUKON THAT I'VE SEEN, AND IT'S SAD TO WALK AWAY, BUT WE'VE GOT THIS IN OUR BACK POCKET.
