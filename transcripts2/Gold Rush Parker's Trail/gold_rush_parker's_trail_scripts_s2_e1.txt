 RICK: GOT THE ROPE? NO! -[BLEEP] -PARKER! LIKE WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS I THINKING? CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS [ ANXIOUS DEEP ENSEMBLE TONES ] ♪♪ THIS IN FRONT OF US, PLUS THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL FOR THE SEASON, $7.5 MILLION. [ CHEERING ] [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WE WORK OUR BALLS OFF UP HERE AND IT'S SEVEN MONTHS, IT'S DAMNED TOUGH. [ CHEERING ] YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST! AND WHEN WE'RE NOT IN THE YUKON MINING, I WANT TO BE OUT HAVING FUN AND LEARNING NEW THINGS AND MEETING NEW PEOPLE, AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I'M AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS OF ABOUT 90, 100 HOUR WEEKS. I WANT TO GO HOME AND HANG OUT IN MY GARAGE AND WORK ON MY CAR AND [BLEEP] HANG WITH MY BUDDIES AND DRINK BEER. GO TO A STRIP CLUB, HAVE FUN. THAT'S MY IDEAS OF FUN, YOU KNOW? I KNOW IT'S BEEN A DAMN LONG SEASON FOR ALL OF YOU, ESPECIALLY YOU RICK. I KNOW YOU AND I HAVEN'T ALWAYS SEEN EYE TO EYE, SO I FIGURED WE NEEDED A GOOD TEAM BONDING EXPERIENCE. LAST FALL RICK AND I WENT AND DID THE CHILKOOT TRAIL AND FOLLOWED THE TRAIL OF THE OLD GOLD RUSH STAMPEDERS AND THIS WINTER WE'RE GOING, WE'RE DOUBLING DOWN. RIGHT, RICK? -OH, YEAH. YAY. AND GOING TO THE JUNGLES OF SOUTH AMERICA. TO DO WHAT? WE'RE GONNA GO FIND THE GOLD. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO GUYANA. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW, I'M SORRY FOR THE BOTH OF YOU. -SUCKERS. -WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE STILL IN FOR IT? YEAH, I GUESS. I DON'T [BLEEP] KNOW WHY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERING ] ♪♪ WELL, THERE'S A GOLD RUSH IN GUYANA. THEY PULLED 650,000 OUNCES OF GOLD OUT OF THE GROUND LAST YEAR. THAT'S OVER WHAT, $800 MILLION? WE'RE GONNA SEE WHAT GOLD MINING IN GUYANA IS ALL ABOUT AND WE'RE GONNA FIND SOME GOLD AND WE'RE GONNA GET MALARIA AND DENGUE FEVER. Narrator: FROM THE GOLD FIELDS OF THE NORTH, PARKER WILL HEAD TO GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA. 80% OF THE COUNTRY IS COVERED IN DENSE TROPICAL RAINFOREST. TEMPERATURES CAN SOAR TO OVER 100 DEGREES WITH 100% HUMIDITY. TROPICAL STORMS AND FLASH FLOODS ARE A CONSTANT DANGER. THE JUNGLE IS HOME TO SOME OF THE DEADLIEST ANIMALS ON EARTH AND MOSQUITO-BORN DISEASES LIKE MALARIA AND DENGUE FEVER CAN BE FATAL. THIS REMOTE COUNTRY IS THE ORIGIN OF THE LEGEND OF EL DORADO AND RECENT SURVEYS ESTIMATE THERE'S OVER $10 BILLION WORTH OF GOLD WAITING TO BE FOUND. COME ON. I FEEL PRETTY PUMPED FOR IT REALLY. YOU NEED GOOD PEOPLE TO BE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITH. Narrator: TO HELP THEM STAY ALIVE IN THE JUNGLE, PARKER AND RICK ARE BRINGING SURVIVAL EXPERT KARLA ANN. KARLA'S [BLEEP] RAD. [ HOOTING ] SHE GOT US THROUGH THE GOLD RUSH TRAIL LAST YEAR. THESE ALPHA MALES, IT'S A LOT OF [HOOTING]. WE'RE KINDA GETTIN' PULLED DOWN STREAM. PARKER! GET YOUR CLOTHES OFF. I DON'T WANNA TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF. YET YOU HAVE TO. WE'RE GETTING YOU IN WARM, DRY CLOTHES. Parker: WHEN YOU IMAGINE A TYPICAL ALASKAN OR YUKON GIRL, SHE IS IT. Rick: THE HANDLE JUST FELL IN THE WATER. THE FISH ARE LAUGHING AT US. -BITE. -OH, BOY. KARLA IS ON FIRE. THANK YOU FOR NOT LETTING US STARVE. WE'LL BE EATING GOOD TONIGHT. SHE IS A HUNTING GUIDE, SNOWBOARDING GUIDE. HAVE YOU GUYS DONE MUCH PLANNING FOR THIS? NO. JUST WORKING WITH IMMATURE MEN IS TOUGH. IT'S GONNA BE THE SAME ON THIS TRIP. [ GROANS ] YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW I'M NOT GONNA [BLEEP] RELAX. IT'S ONE THING I DON'T DO. IF THEY COULD COME OUT OF LIKE THEIR TIME WITH ME JUST BEING LIKE BETTER MEN IN ANY FORM, I'D BE LIKE "YES." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND DO AS MUCH DUE DILIGENCE AS I CAN, BUT I ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT. MY EXTENT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE JUNGLE WAS LIKE A 10 MINUTE WALK THROUGH A FOREST IN AUSTRALIA, WHICH WAS NOT THE JUNGLE IN GUYANA. FOR ME, THIS IS A COMPLETE DIFFERENT WORLD. WHAT ABOUT YOU, HAVE BEEN BEEN TO SOUTH AMERICA AT ALL? NOT EVEN IN MY HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S UP, SAM? Narrator: TO CAPTURE THE TRIP ON FILM, PARKER'S BROUGHT IN AN OLD FRIEND. GOOD TO SEE YA. IRISH ADVENTURE CAMERAMAN SAM BROWN. [ LAUGHS ] MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF PARKER WHEN I MET HIM, HE WAS 15 YEARS OLD, HE WAS THIS SKINNY LITTLE SPOTTY KID IN ALASKA BUT I COULD TELL HE HAD SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. PARKER'S BEEN SHUT DOWN. I WAS PART OF THE TEAM WHO DEVELOPED GOLD RUSH AS AN IDEA BACK IN THE DAY AND I WORKED ON THE FIRST THREE SEASONS. I HAVE STAYED FRIENDS WITH PARKER AND PARKER'S GOING ON A BIG MAD, CRAZY ADVENTURE, AND SO I'VE COME BACK. LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. Parker: I WANTED SAM TO COME BECAUSE THE FILMING PART OF THIS ADVENTURE NEEDS TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT I GET ALONG WITH. ACTUALLY WE'RE DOING THIS SHOW WITH NO CAMERAS. EXCELLENT, OKAY, WE'LL SEE HOW THAT ONE WORKS. BUT ALSO HAS THAT ADVENTURESOME, EXPEDITION SPIRIT. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS IS GONNA PLAY OUT. [ GUNSHOT BOOMS ][ BLEEP ] Parker: THE OTHER REALLY GOOD THING ABOUT SAM IS HE'S BEEN TO GUYANA, SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S A BIG ADDITION BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE MEETING LANDOWNERS, WE'RE GONNA BE MEETING GOLD MINERS, AND YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE THAT PERSONAL, YOU KNOW, RELATIONSHIP AND BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT QUICKLY. GLAD YOU MADE IT. Narrator: SAM HAS BROUGHT GUYANESE MINER FAROSE BARAKAT TO MEET THE TEAM. [ DOG BARKS ]HEY. -COME ON DOZER. -DOZER, COME ON. USING BASIC TECHNOLOGY, FAROSE HAS PULLED GOLD WORTH $18 MILLION FROM THE JUNGLE. -THIS IS RICK NESS. -HOW YOU DOING? -GOOD. -NICE TO MEET YOU. -AND KARLA. -HI. -HELLO. -NICE TO MEET YOU. DO YOU WANT A BEER? GOOD TO MEET YOU. -CHEERS. ARE YOU FROM GUYANA? RIGHT ON. AND HOW BIG AN OPERATION IS IT? KARLA: HOW MANY PEOPLE? SWEET. I MET FAROSE FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN TODD FIRST WENT TO GUYANA FOR LIKE A SORT OF A OFF SEASON SPECIAL AND WAS PUT IN TOUCH WITH FAROSE AND WENT OFF UP THE MAZARUNI RIVER KNOWING NOTHING EXCEPT HIS NAME AND MET HIM AND FORTUNATELY HE WAS A REALLY COOL GUY AND HE BASICALLY LIKE SAVED THE ENTIRE SHOOT. [ LAUGHS ] ♪♪ DUDE, I LIKE THIS AREA MAN. I GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS. Narrator: FOUR SEASONS AGO, TODD HOFFMAN MOVED HIS ENTIRE OPERATION TO GUYANA. WELL WHEN TODD WAS MINING IN GUYANA, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D EVEN HEARD OF THE PLACE. BE HONEST FREDDY, WHAT DO YOU THINK? THAT'S SOME BEAUTIFUL GOLD. I'M GUESSING ABOUT 50 BUCKS A YARD. 50 BUCKS A YARD! THIS IS WHERE THE SEASON STARTS RIGHT HERE. WE'RE GONNA COME OUT OF THIS JUNGLE WITH A PILE OF GOLD. HE WENT IN WITH A BUNCH OF BIG, FANCY MACHINERY. Man: WHOA GUYS, WHOA. YOU ARE FREAKING KIDDING ME! I THINK SOMEONE SAID DON'T [BLEEP] GO OVER THERE. WHY THE [BLEEP] ARE WE OVER THERE? THIS FREAKING JUNGLE IS CURSED. IT SEEMS TO ME FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT DOWN THERE. MANPOWER IS EASIER TO DEAL WITH THAN, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE D11S DOWN HERE. RIGHT. I THINK I'M GONNA BE SWEATING A LOT OVER THERE. I SWEAT WHEN I EAT IN THIS TEMPERATURE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ RELAXED GUITAR MUSIC ] ♪♪ I KNOW FOR A FACT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN GUYANA MAKING A KILLING GOLD MINING. DO IT. PULL IT. WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN TO GUYANA AND WE'RE GONNA LEARN HOW THE LOCALS MINE. LIKE JUST A SKELETON CREW, NO FANCY EQUIPMENT. YOU KNOW, GET DOWN AND DIRTY. IT'S THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME. RICK: WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP. BUT SOMEHOW FOR SOME REASON, I'M GOING TO THE JUNGLE. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: UP AHEAD. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOOD TO ROCK. A SNEAK PEEK AT THE NEW SEASON OF "PARKER'S TRAIL." Parker: SOME NUGGETS IN THERE. SAM: I DO BELIEVE WE'VE FOUND SOME GOLD. WE'RE IN THE MONEY. -FIRE IT UP. -THERE'S OUR WATER. MOVING DIRT, HUH, RICK? MOVING DIRT. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] SHUT IT DOWN. ♪♪ ONE THING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE START THE SHOOT OFFICIALLY IS WE HAVE TO WATCH LIKE THE TOP 10 JUNGLE MOVIES TO GET ALL OUR QUOTES STRAIGHT. LIKE I WATCHED "GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM" THE OTHER DAY. THERE'S SOME GOOD ONES IN THERE. THERE'S SOME GOOD ONES IN THERE, WE'LL WATCH IT. NO. I'VE NEVER SEEN PREDATOR EITHER. I KNOW. Narrator: PARKER SCHNABEL IS PREPARING TO JOIN A MODERN DAY GOLD RUSH IN GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA. HE AIMS TO PROSPECT, FIND GOLD AND STAKE A CLAIM WITH THE HELP OF FRIENDS RICK NESS, KARLA ANN AND ADVENTURE CAMERAMAN SAM BROWN. SAM HAS FILMED IN AFRICA, THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND SOUTH AMERICA INCLUDING OVER A MONTH IN THE JUNGLES OF GUYANA. THE LITTLE BOY IN ME WHO IS QUITE CLOSE TO THE SURFACE IS REALLY [BLEEP] EXCITED ABOUT GOING BACK TO GUYANA. IT HAS SOME OF THE MOST UNSPOILED AND PRISTINE RAINFORESTS ON EARTH. HAVE I BEEN IN THE JUNGLE? WELL I'VE BEEN BORDERLINE IN THE JUNGLE, YOU KNOW? I HAVE NOT BEEN [BLEEP] DEEP IN THE JUNGLE. YEAH. NEXT QUESTION. [ CHUCKLES ] MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS SOMEONE DYING. THAT'S USUALLY MY BIGGEST CONCERN, BUT NOW, I THINK IN GUYANA IT'S A LOT MORE LIKELY. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: GUYANESE MINER FAROSE BARAKAT IS ADVISING THEM HOW TO SURVIVE. FOUR IDIOTS, THREE OF WHOM HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE BUSH BEFORE. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE LIKE THE BIG CHALLENGES? OH MAN, THIS IS GONNA BE FUN. ♪♪ Narrator: THE GUYANESE JUNGLE IS FULL OF LETHAL PREDATORS. SAM: EVERY TIME WE CROSS A CREEK, WE'RE TAKING A RISK. THERE'S PIRANHAS, ELECTRIC EELS, BLACK CAIMAN THAT GET TO BE ABOUT 16 FOOT LONG. THEY'VE BEEN KNOWN TO DRAG FISHERMEN OFF THE BANKS. JAGUARS. [GROWLING] THAT WEIGH 300 POUNDS AND HAVE THE STRONGEST BITE PRESSURE OF ANY BIG CAT. IT'S JUST LIKE, [BLEEP] KNOWS HOW MANY SNAKES. THERE'S MASSIVE ANACONDAS THAT WILL ATTACK AND EAT A CAIMAN. Narrator: THE MOST FEARED SNAKE IS THE LABARIA. DO THEY BITE? KARLA: [ GASP ] AND IS IT POISONOUS? [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, OF COURSE. SO THAT'S THE SNAKE YOU SEE THE MOST? -OKAY. -EVERYTHING'S POISONOUS. YAY, EVEN THE GOLD'S POISONOUS NOW, TOO. [ BLEEP] THE SNAKES MAN, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SNAKES. I'LL SLEEP WITH THE SNAKES, SNAKES DON'T BOTHER ME. ARE THERE SCORPIONS DOWN THERE? I'M NOT SCARED OF THE BIG STUFF THOUGH, AT LEAST YOU CAN SEE IT AND YOU GOT AN EYE ON IT. IT'S THE SMALL STUFF. Parker: BOTFLIES AND TICKS AND THINGS THAT LIKE LIVE IN YOU. FOR ME YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE BIG CONCERN RIGHT NOW. WHOO-O-O! WHOO-O-O! [ BLEEP ] [ LAUGHTER ] I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT THE JUNGLE IS GONNA HOLD. I'M NOT REALLY AFRAID OF ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD EXCEPT FOR SPIDERS AND IT'S AN IRRATIONAL THING. IT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T CONTROL. I HAVE AN IRRATIONAL FEAR OF SPIDERS. THAT'S... YEAH, LIKE IT'S-- THAT SOUNDS LIKE MY -- THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS. IT HAS [BLEEP] CLAWS? -YES, SERIOUSLY. WHAT? MAN, SOMETIMES I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GET SURPRISED BY A SPIDER BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER. I BLACK THE [BLEEP] OUT. I WILL BLACK OUT AND I MEAN I'VE JUMPED OUT OF A MAN LIFT BEFORE FOUR STORIES IN THE AIR, THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED ME WAS THAT I WAS STRAPPED IN BY A HARNESS. Parker: HOW BIG ARE THEY? [ LAUGHTER ] OH, JEEZ. [BLEEP] OFF, MAN. OH MY [BLEEP]. YES, YES, YES. JUMPING [BLEEP] LOBSTER SPIDERS [BLEEP]. [ BLEEP ] I'LL GO TOE TO TOE WITH 10 DUDES MY SIZE IN A FIGHT BEFORE I'LL HAVE A LITTLE [BLEEP] SPIDER LAND ON MY SHOULDER, AND THAT'S NO JOKE. BECAUSE I CANNOT CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS, I CAN'T. Parker: I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT, NOT OURS. SWEET. [ LAUGHS ] SAM JUST CAME UP WITH A FRIEND OF HIS THAT HE MET IN GUYANA, FAROSE, FIRST GUYANESE GOLD MINER I'VE EVER MET AND PRETTY DAMN COOL, YEAH. PRETTY COOL EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT HE SAYS EVERYTHING OUT THERE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU. I'M WORRIED THAT LIKE A JAGUAR WILL ATTACK PARKER. [ GROWLING ] THEY'LL LIKE SNIFF HIS ATTITUDE AND LIKE ATTACK HIM. SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT MYSELF BECAUSE I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD, I'M IN TUNE WITH NATURE MAN. OOH, A RAVEN. [RAVEN CAWING] YEAH, I DON'T KNOW, THE GUYS ARE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS, THEY SEEM REALLY EXCITED. RICK'S OBVIOUSLY [BLEEP] SCARED OF SPIDERS, WHICH IS NOT IDEAL. THE ONE [BLEEP] THING I'M AFRAID OF. [ SNIFFS ] IF ANYBODY CALLS ME A WIMP OR A [BLEEP] FOR THAT, I'LL STAND TOE TO TOE WITH 'EM AND POUND 'EM THROUGH THE GROUND. I JUST HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT ONE PART OF ME. YOU [BLEEP]. Narrator: UP AHEAD. PARKER IS REALLY HARD TO WORK WITH. WHAT'S UP? IT'S BEEN A LONG SEASON MAN, LIKE I'M [BLEEP] BEAT. I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITHOUT HIM. RICK: DO I REALLY WANT TO PUT UP WITH ANOTHER SIX WEEKS OF PARKER'S BULL[BLEEP]? ♪♪ I'M AT THE TAIL END OF A [BLEEP] LONG SUMMER, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON, AND WHY ARE YOU BEING SO MEAN TO ME? Narrator: PARKER AND HIS CREW ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE MINE FOR THE SEASON. IN A FEW DAYS, THEY'LL HEAD OFF ON THE 6,000 MILE JOURNEY TO THE GOLD-RICH JUNGLES OF GUYANA. Parker: I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MINING IN GUYANA. I WANT TO GO DOWN THERE AND FIGURE OUT HOW THE LOCALS DO IT, WHERE THE GOOD GOLD IS, EXPLORE THE COUNTRY, HAVE SOME ADVENTURES AND YOU KNOW, SEE WHAT GOLD MINING IN GUYANA IS ALL ABOUT. SAM: PARKER IS USED TO RUNNING LIKE A MULTI-MULTI MILLION DOLLAR OPERATION WITH [BLEEP] KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM, AND NOW HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO RIGHT BACK TO BASICS ON THIS. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO LEARN TO MINE WITH NO EXCAVATORS AT ALL. ♪♪ Narrator: IN GUYANA, PARKER WILL HAVE TO USE BASIC TECHNIQUES. 100 YEARS AGO, OLD TIMERS IN THE KLONDIKE GOLD RUSH USED HIGH PRESSURE HOSES TO WASH AWAY OVERBURDEN TO GET TO THE GOLD. TODAY IN GUYANA, MINERS STILL USE THE SAME METHODS. HARNESSING THE POWER OF WATER, THEY DIG OUT THE GOLD- RICH PAY DIRT AND SEND IT TO SIMPLE WOODEN SLUICE RUNS. AND JUST LIKE IN THE DAYS OF THE KLONDIKE STAMPEDE, THIS MODERN DAY GOLD RUSH CREATES FRONTIER TOWNS WHERE MINERS CELEBRATE BY BUYING BEER WITH GOLD DUST, AND AFTER A HEAVY NIGHT, THERE'S ENOUGH GOLD ON THE FLOOR TO MAKE SWEEPING AND PANNING A PROFITABLE SIDELINE. SO I HOPE THAT PARKER COMES INTO THIS WITH AN OPEN MIND AND HE'S GOT ENOUGH ENERGY AFTER A BIG, LONG MINING SEASON AND I HOPE THAT HE'S WILLING TO LEARN AND TO ROUGH IT A BIT AND, YEAH, I THINK HE'LL LOVE IT. WE'VE CONQUERED THE YUKON, NOW IT'S TIME TO GO CONQUER THE JUNGLE. THIS WHOLE SITUATION IN THE JUNGLE, YEAH I'M NOT SEEING TOO MANY POSITIVES. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HOT, REALLY RAINY, AND... RICK: AND I'M STRUGGLING TO FIND ANY REAL REASONS TO GO. Narrator: THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER GRUELING SIX WEEKS OF MINING ISN'T THE ONLY REASON RICK IS HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS. I'M [BLEEP] TIRED. DO I REALLY WANNA PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION TO PUT UP WITH ANOTHER SIX WEEKS OF PARKER'S BULL[BLEEP]? -YOU READY? -YEAH. Narrator: PARKER AND RICK STARTED OUT AS BEST BUDDIES SIX YEARS AGO. [ LAUGHING ] WE'RE THE ONLY TWO OUT HERE. NUGGET! LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S A BIG ONE, HUH? OVER THE YEARS, RICK'S HELPED PARKER MINE NEARLY 18,000 OUNCES OF GOLD WORTH OVER $21 MILLION. Parker: RICK'S REALLY BEEN PRETTY GREAT. OVERALL I COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER GUY. Narrator: BUT BEING PARKER'S FOREMAN... YOUR MIND'S NOT IN THE GAME, RICK. HAS PUSHED RICK TO THE LIMIT. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE OUR PROBLEMS AS ANYBODY DOES. [ LAUGH ] PARKER IS HARD TO DEAL WITH, MAN. WHAT THE [ BLEEP ]. LOOK, YOU DON'T WANNA WASTE YOUR [BLEEP] TIME, IT'S MY [BLEEP] TIME TO WASTE. WORKING WITH PARKER'S HARD, HE'S JUST LIKE REALLY HARD TO... WORK WITH. RICK AND I HAVE HAD A FEW LITTLE BLOWUPS. YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A [BLEEP] TODDLER, RICK. YOU ARE. MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE TIMES I WAS READY TO THROW IN THE TOWEL, PACK MY [BLEEP] UP AND [BLEEP] PEACE OUT. THE THING WITH PARKER FROM DAY ONE IS THAT HE REALLY CARES. HE SETS HIMSELF THESE GOALS. WE SET A 4,000 OUNCE GOAL AND THE JOB AIN'T FINISHED 'TIL THERE'S 4,000 OUNCES IN THE BLOCK. AND IF HE DOESN'T REACH THEM, HE HAS A [BLEEP] FIT. YOU REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE IT THE MINUTE I SHOW UP HERE. I CAN TELL THAT, YOU KNOW? -THAT'S NOT TRUE. -IT IS. PARKER IS A HARD MAN TO WORK WITH AND HE KNOWS IT. YEAH, I [BLEEP] HATE EXCUSES. KARLA: SO WHAT, RICK'S BEEN HERE FOR SIX YEARS? I THINK RICK'S EXHAUSTED FROM WORKING WITH PARKER. -FOR [BLEEP] SAKE. -IT'S JUST BULL[BLEEP]. RICK: HEY PARKER, YOU GONNA COPY? Parker: Yeah, go ahead. MAN, I JUST, I DON'T THINK I'M UP FOR THIS [BLEEP] JUNGLE TREK. ♪♪ LOOKS LIKE RICK'S GETTIN' COLD FEET ABOUT THIS WHOLE GUYANA TRIP, SO... HOPEFULLY IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, BURNED OUT RICK NESS TALKING AND NOT SOMETHING THAT HE WON'T COME BACK FROM. YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS TRIP WITHOUT RICK. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN MY RIGHT-HAND MAN, AND WHEN YOU'RE IN A PINCH, HE'S A DAMN GOOD GUY TO HAVE AROUND, AND THAT'S WHY I REALLY WANT HIM TO BE THERE AND REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITHOUT HIM. [ ANXIOUS LIGHT DRUMBEAT ] ♪♪ WHAT'S UP? SO, IT'S BEEN A LONG [BLEEP] SEASON MAN, RIGHT? YEAH. AND MAN I JUST -- I DON'T THINK I'M UP FOR THIS JUNGLE TREK. THIS WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] YOU WANNA CALL IT, MAN. LIKE I'M [BLEEP] BEAT. [BLEEP] MAN, YOU CAN'T BACK OUT ON THIS NOW. YEAH, I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT, I CAN'T MAKE YOU DO IT AND I CAN'T MAKE YOU WANNA DO IT. I THINK IT'LL BE A GOOD EXPERIENCE, AND THERE'S GOLD DOWN THERE, AND I REALLY THINK FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT AND BUSINESS STANDPOINT, IT'S WORTH TO JUST GO TAKE A LOOK AT. I WOULD HATE TO SEE YOU NOT GO AND REGRET IT. I'M TIRED AND SPENDING SIX [BLEEP] WEEKS SOMEWHERE WHERE I'VE NEVER BEEN AND NEVER REALLY WANTED TO GO, I JUST REALLY DON'T WANNA DO IT. [ BLEEP ] Narrator: UP AHEAD. LET'S GO FIND THE [BLEEP] GOLD. A SNEAK PEEK AT THE NEW SEASON OF "PARKER'S TRAIL." OW! WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT? MASSIVE DREDGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER. THAT'S OUR FIRST GOLD FROM GUYANA. I DON'T FEEL GOOD. KARLA: OH MY [BLEEP], PARKER! THIS ADVENTURE COULD BE OVER BEFORE IT'S EVEN STARTED. [ ANXIOUS ENSEMBLE TONES ] ♪♪ [ PLANE HUMMING ] ♪♪ Narrator: FROM THE KLONDIKE IT'S 6,000 MILES AND 28 HOURS ON FOUR PLANES TO THE CAPITAL CITY OF GUYANA, GEORGETOWN. ♪♪ [ CAR HORNS HONKING ] [ INDISTINCT CHATTER ] ♪♪ ♪♪ IT FEELS GOOD TO BE HERE, YOU KNOW? I'M PRETTY WIPED OUT FROM TRAVELING. HAINES, ALASKA TO GEORGETOWN, GUYANA IS A LOT TRIP. EVERYTHING IS NEW TO ME HERE, FIRST TIME IN SOUTH AMERICA. ♪♪ I'M ANXIOUS AT JUST ABOUT ALL OF IT, YOU KNOW? IT'S GONNA BE ALL NEW TO ME. I'VE NEVER SPENT A MINUTE IN A JUNGLE OR IN A COUNTRY LIKE THIS OR ANYTHING. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THAT. I'M NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING NEW PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW, CHECKING OUT GOLD FIELDS. LIKE SOMETIMES GOLD MINERS CAN BE A PRETTY ROUGH BUNCH. I'M EXCITED TO GET INTO THE JUNGLE AND SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND SEE IF I CAN HANDLE IT. ♪♪ SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH RICK? I SENT HIM AN EMAIL SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE'RE STAYING AND WHAT THE DATES ARE AND ALL THAT STUFF AND HE, YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS ABOUT IT AND I WAS TRYING TO COAX HIM, BUT I DOUBT HE'LL SHOW UP. HOW HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN GETTING ON, PARKER? IT WAS A LONG SUMMER, IT WAS A LONG SUMMER. RICK AND I WERE BUTTIN' HEADS A FAIR BIT. THINGS ENDED ON, I THOUGHT PRETTY GOOD TERMS, BUT YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT SIDE OF THAT STORY. YOU KNOW, REALLY WE FOUND A LOT OF GOLD THIS SEASON, BUT HE WORKED HIS ASS OFF. I DON'T BLAME HIM AT ALL. [ CAR HORN HONKS ] HE HAD A LONG HARD SUMMER. -YEAH -BUT, YEAH, ITS A BUMMER. YEAH, TOTAL BUMMER. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING SOME TIME WITH HIM OFF THE MINE SITE. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC] ♪♪ [ SCOOTER MOTOR ACCELERATES] ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: JUST LIKE LAST YEARS TRAIL, THE CREW WILL BE WEARING CAMERAS AND FILMING THEMSELVES. SAM: I'LL BE COVERING MOST OF THE ACTION ON THIS CAMERA. AND THIS IS YOUR MAIN WHIP? YEAH. WHERE DO YOU GRAB THIS THING AT? THIS IS SO GETTING DESTROYED. AND YOU'LL BE WEARING THESE THE WHOLE TIME. -CAN I TRY IT ON? -YEAH, PLEASE. THIS IS BAND-O-CAM. Narrator: SAM'S DEVELOPED A MINI CAM DESIGNED TO CAPTURE EACH INDIVIDUALS PERSPECTIVE AND SURVIVE THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY OF THE JUNGLE. ALL THE AUDIO, ALL THE BATTERIES AND STUFF. THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE BATTERY AND AUDIO AND EVERYTHING? YEAH, SO LOOK. -SO THAT'S THE SHOT? -YEAH. -[ LAUGHS] -YEAH, YEAH. OKAY. PARKER, KARLA CAM. OH, YEAH. THAT'S SCARY. YOU ARE GONNA CHOKE ME OUT. KARLA IS THAT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH? OH THIS IS GREAT. UNTIL WE START SWEATING...MORE -HI, DANNY. -WHAT'S UP, MATE? -I'M DOING YOUR JOB NOW. -[ LAUGHS ] SO DID YOU PICK UP THESE MAPS? YEAH. THEY'RE SWEAT PROOF, THAT'S GREAT. THIS IS GUYANA. WE ARE...HERE, GEORGETOWN. OKAY? AND THERE'S LOADS OF THIS COUNTRY HASN'T BEEN MAPPED PROPERLY. WE COULD VERY WELL BE THE FIRST PEOPLE EVER, LIKE, SETTING FOOT THERE. Narrator: TO STAND A CHANCE OF FINDING GOLD, PARKER NEEDS TO CHOOSE HIS START POINT CAREFULLY. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS WHERE TODD STARTED AND WHAT HE DID AND WHAT HE DID RIGHT OR WRONG. WHERE WAS HE AT? TODD WAS ABOUT... THERE, NEAR MAHDIA. THERE'S THE BIGGEST SORT OF MINING TOWNSHIP, IT'S CALLED MAHDIA. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD START WHERE TODD OFTEN IS, GROUND ZERO, RIGHT? YEAH, CAUSE ROADS, THERE'S AN AIRSTRIP. I AM SURE THAT TODD HAD THE SAME THOUGHT, "LETS GO WHERE THE GOLD FIELDS ARE," AND WE SHOULD START THE SAME WAY THEY DID. HE WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE EVERYONE ELSE IS. THE MINING SIDE OF THIS, WE'VE GOT TO BE ON THE BEST GROUND WE COULD POSSIBLY FIND. SO ITS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A CASE OF GETTING OUT OF THERE. I MEAN, THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT BACKPACKS. JUST FIND A RIVER THAT'S NAMED SOMETHING THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH MINING AND WE'LL JUST GO THERE. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT? WHAT THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU DOING HERE? [ LAUGHS ] -[ BLEEP ] -YAY! IT'S GOOD, HUH, BUDDY? I'M IN GUYANA. DUDE, I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BAIL. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT THE [BLEEP] WHAT'S UP, SAM? YAY. I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME SECOND RATE RICK NESS STANDING IN HERE. I'M GLAD IT DIDN'T GET AWKWARD. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BAND'S BACK TOGETHER YAY, THE BAND'S BACK TOGETHER. SO WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? LAST TIME WE TALKED YOU WERE PRETTY SOLID "NO." WELL, A FEW THINGS. I MEAN, ONE WAS A BIT OF FEAR OF MISSING OUT ON SOME ADVENTURE, AND THE OTHER IS I'VE GOT SOME THINGS I GOT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. AND I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO BE DISAPPEARING INTO THIS JUNGLE FOR SIX WEEKS, SO I FIGURED I BETTER GET MY BUTT DOWN HERE. OR MORE. WE MIGHT JUST MAKE IT SIX YEARS. SIX YEARS, YEAH. WELL, DO YOU WANT TO GO AND HAVE A LITTLE TALK... -YEAH. -...BEFORE WE GET STARTED ON THIS WHOLE DEAL. INTERESTING PLACE. SO, I GUESS THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE WAY HERE WAS SOME PRETTY BIG NEWS AND IT INVOLVES NEXT YEAR AND MINING. AND... YEAH, I AM GOING OUT MINING ON MY OWN. I'VE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY, AND I AM GOING TO TAKE IT. UM... GEEZ. I HEARD ABOUT YOU BEING BIT BY A SNAKE? WHOA. Narrator: OF THE TEN SPECIES OF VENOMOUS SNAKES IN THE GUYANESE JUNGLE, THE DEADLIEST IS THE AGGRESSIVE LABARIA. JUST 50MG, A RAINDROPS WORTH OF ITS VENOM IS ENOUGH TO KILL A MAN. HOW PAINFUL? WOW. YOU'RE STILL LIVING OF COURSE. I WILL BE MUCH MORE CAREFUL FROM NOW ON. [ DRAMATIC DRUM BEAT ] I GOT SOME PRETTY BIG NEWS AND IT INVOLVES NEXT YEAR. Narrator: RICK NESS HAS FLOWN TO GEORGETOWN, GUYANA TO CALL TIME ON SIX YEARS OF MINING HISTORY. YEAH, I'M GOING OUT MINING ON MY OWN. [ SHARP SIGH ] I KNOW THAT'S -- I KNOW THAT'S, YEAH, THAT'S A BIG THING. UM... I OWE YOU A LOT, MAN. LIKE, I OWE YOU A LOT, AND YOU KNOW, I ALSO DON'T WANT THIS TO RUIN THIS TRIP. IF IT DOES, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT ME TO BAIL, I UNDERSTAND AS WELL. OH, NO, NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL NO. I JUST... UH... I COMPLETELY GET IT. IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES, I'D BE LOOKING AT DOING THE SAME EXACT THING, SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SIT HERE AND BE MAD, AND I'VE I'VE DONE AS MUCH AS I CAN TO DO THAT EXACT THING. YOU HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF [BLEEP] OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS, AND THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF TIMES WHERE I LOOK BACK AND, BOY, YOU COULD OF WALKED AWAY. EASILY JUSTIFIED, AND [BLEEP], YOU'RE A... I MEAN, YOU ARE, BY FAR, THE HARDEST WORKER OUT OF ANY OF THESE GROUPS. I'M JUST TRYING TO BETTER MYSELF. AND I AM NEVER GOING TO FAULT SOMEBODY FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, YOU GAVE ME A SHOT SIX YEARS AGO THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY NEVER HAD TO STAND BY ME. I DIDN'T KNOW [BLEEP] ALL, RIGHT, AND... THAT GOES BOTH WAYS, RIGHT? -WELL... -THAT GOES BOTH WAYS. AND YOU DID STAND BY ME AND YOU DID GIVE ME A LOT OF SHOTS, AND I WILL FOREVER BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. BUT I THINK IT IS TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FIT, BECAUSE YOU'VE TRIED TO DO YOUR [BLEEP] BEST, AND THIS WILL BE NO DIFFERENT. I KNOW YOU WILL TRY TO DO YOUR BEST.

[ LAUGHS ] OH, LETS GET ANOTHER BEER. YEAH. IT WAS QUITE THE BOMBSHELL HIM TELLING ME THAT HE'S NOT COMING BACK NEXT YEAR. AND I REALLY RESPECT AND APPRECIATE HIM FOR LETTING ME KNOW THAT NOW. AND HONESTLY IT FEELS GOOD TO TELL YOU IN PERSON. BUT WHAT REALLY MAKES ME OKAY WITH THIS IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE CAN WALK AWAY FRIENDS, AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE FRIENDS FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
