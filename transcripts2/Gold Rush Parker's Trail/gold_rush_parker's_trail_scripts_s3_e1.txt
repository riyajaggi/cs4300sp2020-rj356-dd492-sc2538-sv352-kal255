 WE'RE LESS THAN A MILE AWAY FROM A PLACE WHERE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF OUNCES OF GOLD HAVE BEEN FOUND, BUT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. IN THIS PLACE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POLICE ESCORT. Man: [BLEEP] [ SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] OH [BLEEP] THE MINE HAS SHOT PEOPLE BEFORE. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] -GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! -GO, GO, GO, GO.

MITCH, THIS [BLEEP] THING'S ON FIRE. ...MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF ISSUES WITH TONY. YOU WANT 100 OUNCES LIKE NOW? LIKE, A CHRONIC DISEASE, I CAN'T SHAKE THIS [BLEEP] GUY. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE'VE HAD, LIKE, MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF GOLD. LIKE, IT'S THE BEST SEASON WE'VE EVER HAD. OUR SEASON TOTAL, 7,427 POINT -- -[ LAUGHS ] -WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I THINK THIS YEAR, MORE SO THAN ANY, I'VE HAD A ROUGH TIME, PERSONALLY, BECAUSE OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW, ASHLEY AND I HAVE BROKEN UP. SHE WAS THE FIRST, YOU KNOW, LONG-TERM, REAL GIRLFRIEND I'VE HAD. AND RICK NESS, OUR FOREMAN, LEFT. YEAH, I'M GOING OUT MINING ON MY OWN. GEEZ. THAT WAS THE DOUBLE WHAMMY, AND THAT ALL CAME OFF THE BACK OF MY GRANDFATHER DYING, SO, LIKE, IT'S A LOT OF STUFF HITTING AT ONCE. [ GUNSHOTS ] THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING FOR ME THIS YEAR, AND, YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT, LIKE, GUYANA SHOWED ME LAST YEAR IS THAT I KIND OF WANT TO JUST SPEND SOME TIME WORRYING ABOUT SURVIVING AND JUST WORRYING ABOUT TOMORROW AND NOT WHAT HAPPENED LAST MONTH OR A YEAR AGO OR WHATEVER. ♪♪ UNBELIEVABLE! Narrator: LAST OFF-SEASON, PARKER HEADED TO SOUTH AMERICA TO PROSPECT FOR GOLD IN THE TROPICAL RAINFORESTS OF GUYANA. MOVING DIRT, HUH, RICK? MOVING DIRT! [BLEEP] GUYANA WAS RAD. I LOVED GUYANA. LET'S GO FIND THE [BLEEP] GOLD. SUPER IN, MAN. IT REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO THE WORLD. LIKE, IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.

QUICKSAND. -WHOA. -WOW. OH. ♪♪ I JUST NEED A RESET. LIKE, I NEED A BIG ADVENTURE WITH SOME GOOD FRIENDS AND... AND JUST...GO. ♪♪ Narrator: PARKER IS HOPING TO RETRACE HIS GRANDFATHER'S WARTIME JOURNEY TO THE PACIFIC AND TO LEARN HOW THE PAPUANS MINE GOLD. HE'S ASKED FRIEND AND CAMERAMAN SAM BROWN TO SCOUT OUT PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND FIND A GOLD TRAIL. YEAH, I'M JUST COMING DOWN HERE TO PICK UP SAM. HE JUST GOT BACK FROM PAPUA NEW GUINEA, SO LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. GOOD TO SEE HE'S STILL ALIVE, ANYWAY. ♪♪ -[ LAUGHS ] -HEY! -HOW'S IT GOING? -GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. -GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. -AH. HOW YOU KEEPING? Parker: YEAH, GOOD. HOP IN. YOU'RE STUCK WITH THE DOG.[ LAUGHS ] HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?I'M GOOD, MAN. I'M GOOD. SO, HOW'S THINGS? THE HISTORY, THE PEOPLE, THERE'S SO MUCH GOLD THERE. THERE'S GUYS OUT THERE WITH NOTHING BUT A GOLD PAN, YOU KNOW, KIND OF PICKING NUGGETS, LIKE, LITERALLY OUT OF THE CREEK OR FROM UNDER BOULDERS, AND THEN THERE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST GOLD MINES IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. Narrator: EVERY YEAR, PAPUA NEW GUINEA PRODUCES $2.6 BILLION WORTH OF GOLD. ♪♪ THIS REMOTE ISLAND NATION IS LOCATED IN A REGION KNOWN AS "THE RING OF FIRE," AND HAS MORE THAN 60 VOLCANOES, THE MOST IN THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC. WHEN TECTONIC PLATES COVERING THE EARTH'S SURFACE COLLIDE, EARTHQUAKES FORCE MINERAL-RICH MAGMA UP THROUGH THE EARTH'S CRUST. THE LAVA CRYSTALLIZES, BECOMING A SILICA-RICH FLUID THAT PUSHES THROUGH CRACKS AND FORMS QUARTZ VEINS. IT'S INSIDE THESE VEINS WHERE GOLD IS DEPOSITED AND WHY PAPUA NEW GUINEA IS ONE OF THE MOST GOLD-RICH PLACES ON THE PLANET. ♪♪ PAPUA NEW GUINEA IS NUTS. [ CHUCKLES ] SO MANY WAYS WE CAN KILL OURSELVES OUT THERE.

I THINK HE WAS VERY, LIKE, EXCITED TO BE MINING ON HIS OWN, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT'S -- YOU KNOW, FOR HIM, I COULD SEE HOW HE'S, LIKE -- MOVING ON MIGHT BE PART OF IT. LIKE, HIM AND I HAVE NOT REALLY... INTERACTED HARDLY AT ALL. WE CAN'T DO THIS WITH THREE PEOPLE, MAN. IT'LL BE TOO HARD. YEAH, I -- IT'D BE TOUGH. LIKE, WE WERE SHORT-HANDED LAST YEAR. YEAH. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE. SOME OF THE PLACES WE'LL BE GOING, YOU KNOW, IT'S DANGEROUS. YOU KNOW? THERE'S A LOT OF VIOLENT CRIME. THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF TRIBAL WARFARE. FOR MANY PAPUANS, GOLD MINING IS ABOUT SURVIVAL. NO GOLD MEANS NO FOOD, SO LOCALS ARE KNOWN TO PROTECT THEIR CLAIMS WITH DEADLY FORCE. I NEVER THINK BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. RIGHT. [ CHUCKLES ] AND MOST SHOOTS I DO WITH YOU, SOMETHING DOES. I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO FIND SOMEBODY? YEAH? YEAH, YOU KNOW WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR. I THINK JUST SOMEBODY WITH SOME MEDICAL QUALIFICATIONS WOULD BE GOOD, SOMEBODY THAT IS QUALIFIED TO BE IN THOSE SITUATIONS AND HAS BEEN IN THOSE SITUATIONS BEFORE WOULD BE [BLEEP] GOOD TO HAVE. SO THEY NEED TO BE AN EXPERT MEDIC AND PREFERABLY WITH, LIKE, COMBAT EXPERIENCE. WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AROUND, BUT IT'S A LOT OF BOXES TO TICK. ♪♪ UP AHEAD... MAKE A CALL. MAKE IT QUICK. OH, MY [BLEEP] ...A SNEAK PEEK AT THE NEW SEASON OF "PARKER'S TRAIL." [ PEOPLE CLAMORING ] THE MINE HAS SHOT PEOPLE BEFORE. [ ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] Fred: WATCH! LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! PARKER! ♪♪ OW, THAT HURTS. OH, YEAH. Narrator: THIS OFF-SEASON ON "PARKER'S TRAIL"... FOR US, MINING, WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, IT COSTS US SOME MONEY. WHEN YOU GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS ZERO SUPPORT AND YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, LIKE, YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. -PARKER, BEHIND YOU, MAN! -LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! LIKE, YOU SCREW UP, AND YOU'RE A DEAD MAN. Fred: PARKER! ♪♪ Narrator: PARKER SCHNABEL IS ON AN EPIC EXPEDITION TO THE REMOTE SOUTH PACIFIC WILDERNESS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA. ♪♪ AND THERE'S TWO REAL REASONS WE'RE GOING TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA. I MEAN, THE FIRST IS THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF GOLD AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF MINING AND PROSPECTING HISTORY THERE, AND THE SECOND BIG REASON IS THAT MY GRANDPA WAS IN THE NAVY AND STATIONED IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC VERY CLOSE TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA, AND IT'S THE PART OF HIS LIFE THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. I'LL GO AND GET THE MAN WITH THE TOOL BOX. HE'S AWFUL IMPATIENT. YOUNG PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING IN A BIG HURRY, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET OLDER TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE. Parker: MY GRANDPA WAS MY BIGGEST MENTOR AND ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS. John: A FEW FLAKES IS ALL WE GOT. I DOUBT IF WE MADE A DOLLAR. WELL, IF THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT, WE MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME. IT'S A TEST. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. JUST KEEP WORKING TOWARDS THE BETTER GROUND. EVENTUALLY, YOU'LL HIT IT. AND IT WAS TOUGH. IT WAS TOUGH LOSING HIM. YOU KNOW? LIKE, WE SAT AND TALKED FOR HOURS AND HOURS ALMOST EVERY NIGHT ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HE'D BEEN THROUGH IN HIS LIFE. YOUR FATHER SAID TO ME, "DAD, LET ME MAKE MY OWN MISTAKES," AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THE SAME BLOOD IN YOU THAT HE HAS. OH, AND I MAKE A LOT OF MY OWN MISTAKES. HE REALLY STARTED TO OPEN UP ABOUT HIS PAST AND HIS HISTORY. AND SOMETIMES WE'D COVER A YEAR IN A NIGHT, AND SOMETIMES WE'D COVER A HALF A DAY, YOU KNOW, JUST EVENTS IN HIS LIFE THAT STUCK OUT. [ LAUGHS ] THE ONLY SPAN THAT HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WAS HIS TIME IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC DURING WORLD WAR II. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE JUST WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT. John: PEARL HARBOR WAS AN INCENTIVE FOR ME TO JOIN THE NAVY. I WENT TO THE RECRUITING STATION AND SAID, "I'D LIKE TO VOLUNTEER TO GO IN THE SUBMARINES." FEW WEEKS, THEY SENT ME TO BOOT CAMP, AND THE FIRST THING I KNOW, I'M IN THE NAVAL AIR CORP. I WANTED IN THE WATER, AND THEY PUT ME IN THE AIR. TYPICAL. [ CHUCKLES ] ♪♪ Narrator: THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC SAW SOME OF THE FIERCEST AND BLOODIEST FIGHTING OF WORLD WAR II. OVER 100,000 U.S. SERVICEMEN WERE EITHER KILLED OR REPORTED MISSING IN ACTION. ♪♪ I KNOW IT WAS REALLY TOUGH FOR HIM. HE PULLED A LOT OF DEAD BODIES AND DYING PEOPLE OUT OF AIRPLANES. I LOVE YOU. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE MISERIES THAT I'VE HAD TO WALK THROUGH. I REALLY HOPE WE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT AND SEE THE PLACES THAT HE SAW AND GET A FEEL FOR WHAT THOSE GUYS WENT THROUGH DURING WORLD WAR II IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC. ♪♪ Narrator: TO START TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS GRANDPA ENDURED, PARKER VISITS HIS FATHER IN HAINES, ALASKA. A BIG PART OF THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA TRIP IS GOING TO BE ABOUT MY GRANDPA'S HISTORY WITH THAT AREA, SO I'M JUST HEADING HOME TO SEE WHAT MY DAD KNOWS. ♪♪ Roger: OKAY. THIS IS THE MINI SHOP HERE. THIS IS YOUR GRANDPA'S CHEST FROM HIS OFFICE. CONSOLIDATED ALL THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT. ON HIS DEATH, THEY PASSED A FLAG ONTO HIM. FROM THE AMERICAN LEGION?RIGHT. YEAH. OH, YEAH. THESE ARE OLD. I'VE NEVER SEEN THESE BEFORE. UNBELIEVABLY OLD. BOY, HE'S GOT A LOT OF THINGS HERE. MY FATHER, HE'D HAVE HAD A STORY FOR EVERY PICTURE. YOU KNOW? YEAH. LOOK AT THAT. THERE YOU GO. THERE'S DAD IN THE NAVY. BOY. "AFTER THE TEARS AND THE WRATH, AFTER THE SORROW AND PAIN, HIS MERCY HAS OPENED A PATH TO LIVE WITH OURSELVES AGAIN." ♪♪ THAT'S JUST SUCH A PERSONAL THING FOR HIM. Parker: I MEAN, I'VE GOT EVERY YEAR OF HIS LIFE PRETTY WELL PEGGED EXCEPT FOR THOSE THREE OR FOUR YEARS THAT HE WAS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, SO... THOSE PHOTOS HE HAD FROM WORLD WAR II, HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE PHOTOS. SO IT'D BE GOOD TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE. OH, LOOK, LOOK. THIS IS THE ONE I REMEMBER, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT? YEAH. DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PLANE THAT WOULD BE? THAT'S AN AVENGER. I'M SURE THAT'S ONE THAT HE WORKED ON. YOU KNOW? ISN'T THAT COOL? YEAH. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DAD AND WHAT HE DID, YOU COULD FIND OUT WHERE THESE PLANES -- THERE'S PROBABLY SOME OF THESE RELICS AROUND. YOU KNOW?LIKE, A RESTORED ONE? YEAH. YOU SHOULD DO JUST THAT. YOU KNOW? FIND ONE OF THOSE. I'LL BET IT WOULD MEAN A LOT. ♪♪ Parker: I'M LOOKING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE AVENGER. ♪♪ YOU KNOW, THERE WERE ALMOST 10,000 OF THEM BUILT. THERE'S NOT VERY MANY LEFT, BUT THERE'S AN OUTFIT THAT HAS ONE OF THEM, AND THEY'RE CALLED THE COMMEMORATIVE AIR FORCE. SO, I MEAN, LOGICALLY, THIS WOULD BE THE THING TO GO DO, 'CAUSE THEY HAVE A FULLY INTACT AVENGER... ♪♪ ...LOOKS LIKE IN COLORADO, SO, I MEAN, WE SHOULD GO TO IT. WE SHOULD GO LOOK AT IT. ♪♪ Narrator: PARKER MAY HAVE FOUND AN AIR-WORTHY AVENGER, BUT HIS EXPEDITION TEAM IS STILL A MAN DOWN. ADVENTURE CAMERAMAN SAM MUST FIND A NEW RECRUIT. Sam: SO, WE'VE COME TO WASHINGTON STATE. WE'RE GOING TO MEET A GUY WHO I HOPE WILL TAKE RICK'S PLACE ON THE TEAM. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO'S AN EXPERT MEDIC, AN EXPERT LINGUIST. HE NEEDS TO BE INCREDIBLY GOOD AT WORKING IN POTENTIALLY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS. I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THIS GUY CALLED FRED LEWIS, WHO'S A FORMER GREEN BERET. ♪♪ FRED -- ON PAPER, HE'S THE PERFECT FIT. ♪♪ [ DOORBELL RINGS ] FRED? WHAT'S UP? HOW'S IT GOING?HEY, MAN. HOW YOU DOING? SAM. NICE TO MEET YOU FINALLY.GOOD TO MEET YOU. Narrator: FORMER STAFF SERGEANT FRED LEWIS HAS 14 YEARS' EXPERIENCE AS A GREEN BERET AND SPECIAL FORCES MEDIC. HAVE A SEAT.Sam: OH, THANKS, MAN. SO, HOW COME YOU'RE NOT IN THE MILITARY ANYMORE? I GOT INJURED IN 2009. THE LAST MISSION WE WERE ON, I ACTUALLY GOT SHOT BY A SNIPER RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THE HELMET. A MILLION-DOLLAR SHOT WHERE IT DIDN'T KILL ME, BUT IT JUST ENDED UP SNAPPING ONE OF THE VERTEBRAE IN MY NECK. SO AT THAT POINT I WAS LIKE, "A," I'M LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. "B," I'M PROBABLY RUNNING OUT OF LUCK, AND IT'S JUST TIME FOR ME TO HANG IT UP. SINCE LEAVING THE MILITARY IN 2009, FRED'S TRAINED AS AN ADVENTURE ATHLETE. HE NOW COMPETES REGULARLY IN EXTREME ENDURANCE RACES. WE'VE GOT A BIG EXPEDITION TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO'S JUST GOING TO SLOT SEAMLESSLY INTO THIS TEAM, KEEP US ALL ALIVE, KEEP US SAFE. THAT BASICALLY WAS WHAT I DID IN THE MILITARY, SO THIS IS GOING TO BE RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. I'VE GOT ALL MY MEDICAL GEAR OUT THERE IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT.YEAH, LET'S DO IT. LET'S DO IT. Fred: LIKE, THIS IS LIKE A LITTLE THROW BAG. IT BASICALLY HAS EVERYTHING. THIS HAS A SURGICAL SET IF SOMEONE GETS REALLY HURT. WHAT KIND OF INJURIES HAVE YOU TREATED BEFORE? ANYTHING FROM GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE CHEST, BROKEN BONES, AMPUTATIONS, BLAST INJURIES, BURNS. PARKER'S KIND OF PERSONAL DISCIPLINE WITH, LIKE, ANTIMALARIALS AND HYGIENE AND THINGS MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST. [ SIGHS ] WHY THE [BLEEP] DID WE HIKE THAT? Karla: PARKER, ESPECIALLY, GOT SLAPPED AROUND BY THE JUNGLE. OW! SOMETHING BIT ME. THE JUNGLE JUST KEEPS JUST CHUCKING PUNCHES AT US. Rick: PARKER'S NOT IN GOOD SHAPE AT ALL. Man: ARE YOU HAVING STOMACH CRAMPS? [ Weakly ] YEAH, BAD. REALLY [BLEEP] BAD. I HATE PUKING MORE THAN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. UPSET STOMACH, DIARRHEA, ALL THAT BULL THAT I'M ALSO TRAINED TO TREAT. WHAT OTHER GOODIES DO YOU HAVE? SO, I'VE GOT MY TRUSTY BROWN STAR, A LITTLE DUSTY. THIS ONE MEANS A LOT TO ME. GOT MY AIRBORNE WINGS, SO THAT BASICALLY JUST SAYS, "I JUMP OUT OF PLANES AT 1,200 FEET, AND THE PARACHUTE'S PULLED FOR ME." AIR ASSAULT, HALO -- MY FAVORITE. SO THAT'S HIGH ALTITUDE, LOW OPENING. THAT'S THE STUFF YOU SEE ON TV WITH THE BIG OXYGEN MASKS AND, YOU KNOW, SKY DIVERS. ♪♪ I LOVED IT. THIS IS AN AWARD. IT LOOKS LIKE A HAT, BUT THE GREEN BERET IS THE ONLY -- I THINK THERE'S TWO BERETS THAT YOU ACTUALLY GET AWARDED TO YOU. PROBABLY STILL FITS. HAVEN'T WORN IT IN A LONG TIME, BUT -- ♪♪ OH, YEAH, STILL A GREEN BERET. I THINK THE BEARD ACTUALLY MAKES IT LOOK A LITTLE BIT BETTER. A LITTLE BIT OF DOG HAIR ON THIS GREEN BERET. WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S RETIRED. RELAXED. SHOULD I JUST WEAR THIS ALL THE TIME? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.JUST EVERYWHERE WE GO? YEAH.PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE, "WHOA." PARTICULARLY WITH THE BEARD, IT'S A GREAT COMBINATION. Sam: EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN TODAY WITH FRED, LIKE, HIS EXPERIENCE, HIS ATTITUDE, IF ANYONE'S GOING TO MAKE PAPUA NEW GUINEA A SUCCESS AND KEEP US ALIVE AND BRING US HOME IN ONE PIECE, I THINK IT'S FRED. SO, YEAH, FINGERS CROSSED. THE NEXT STEP, WE HAVE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO PARKER. HOPEFULLY, THEY DON'T HATE EACH OTHER, AND THEN WE'VE GOT A TEAM AND GO TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA. ♪♪ SO, WE JUST GOT HERE THIS MORNING, AND WE'RE GOING UP IN THE AVENGER HERE SHORTLY. Narrator: PARKER IS AT THE COLORADO WING OF THE COMMEMORATIVE AIR FORCE. THEY HAVE A WORKING WAR PLANE EXACTLY LIKE THE ONES HIS GRANDPA MAINTAINED. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, PRETTY COLD. THEY HAVE NO HEAT, SO WE'LL SEE IF I DON'T FREEZE TO DEATH. Narrator: THE TORPEDO BOMBER WAS NAMED THE AVENGER BECAUSE AMERICA WANTED REVENGE FOR PEARL HARBOR. A HANDFUL HAVE BEEN PRESERVED BY AN ARMY OF DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS. I NEVER REALLY EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT RESEARCHING SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AND TO FINALLY DO IT AND FIND THIS PLACE, AND I'M GOING TO GO FLY THAT. ♪♪ I HOPE WE DON'T CRASH. [ CHUCKLES ] ♪♪ I'M PRETTY PUMPED.

Narrator: THERE WERE THREE CREW MEMBERS ONBOARD EACH AVENGER -- A PILOT, A RADIOMAN, AND A REAR-TURRET GUNNER. YEAH, I'VE NEVER BEEN SOMEBODY THAT WOULD GET, LIKE, CLAUSTROPHOBIC, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE, LIKE, BEING IN A PLANE THAT'S TAKING FIRE AND BEING IN THIS BUBBLE. Narrator: THE AVENGER ALSO HAD TWO .50-CALIBER MACHINE GUNS IN THE WINGS. IT CARRIED 750 ROUNDS. HAVE YOU HEARD THE SAYING, "GIVE THEM THE WHOLE 9 YARDS"? YEAH. IF YOU MEASURE 750 ROUNDS, IT'S 9 YARDS LONG.REALLY? THAT'S WHERE THE SAYING CAME FROM. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS SOME SPORTS TERM OR SOMETHING. NO, SIR. IT'S WORLD WAR II.SO WHEN THEY SAY, "GIVE THEM THE WHOLE 9 YARDS," THAT'S FEED THEM THE WHOLE BELT OF AMMO. YEP. THAT IS SO COOL. MM-HMM. Narrator: THE AVENGER WAS VERSATILE.
