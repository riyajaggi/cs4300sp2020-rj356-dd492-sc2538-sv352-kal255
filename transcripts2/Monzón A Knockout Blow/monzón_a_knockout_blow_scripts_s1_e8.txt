 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES STRANGLER Hi. -How are you feeling? -Better. Much better. I have to go downtown. To Tel. See if I can solve the phone issue. All right. He will stay here and look after you. No. There's no need.

 You can't be alone. I won't be alone. I'm going to the office. No. No, you're not. Yes, I am. I need to work. Work from here. Without a phone? They're mafia, Gustavo. I told you to stay out of it. What do you want me to do? You know what I want you to do. Again with that? You're out of your mind, Luz. Don't talk to me like that, Gustavo.

 Look at you! Don't you see? I'm sick of this. It's just a couple of weeks. Let's just hold tight. Everything will be all right. Don't worry. Morning. Come with me. What are you doing here? How's it going? I thought this was still my office. Look at you. It's nothing. I'm okay. This comes from further up, right? Yes. That's why we need to dig deeper than ever. Come in. -Mr. Parisi? -Yes? "Fracture of hyoid bone, larynx and tracheal cartilages. Hematoma in the back of the neck and the mastoid region and strangulation marks. These injuries are sufficient to cause the victim's death." He killed her. He strangled her and then pushed her. -Does it square with what Sainz said? -Yes. We got him. There it is. A tremendous strike by Monzón. GREAT AS ALWAYS, BUT A BIGGER CHAMPION Monzón gets the win for Argentina! "I REGRET THE DAY I ASKED ALICIA TO COME TO MAR DEL PLATA" BALCONY HE TOSSED HER FROM HERE "YES, I WAS QUITE DRUNK." "IF I'M IN PRISON, I DON'T WANT TO LIVE. WHY WOULD I?" "IF I'M GUILTY, I'D RATHER BE SENTENCED TO DEATH" STRANGLER -Why do you do that? -Do what? That. Piling your food on one side. Fuck off. Excuse me, sir. What's wrong? Is that because you're famous? You're upper class now, man? All right. Why don't you teach me how to fight? Like this. I'd love to. What do you say? Is my stance good? Check this out. Just like Locche, look. Hey, dumbass, why are you changing the channel? Let him watch what he wants. Change it back. Leave him alone. We watch the same thing every day. I'll watch whatever I want, okay? Or do you want to be my bitch tonight? ...on Peralta Ramos Avenue... Leave that on, Chuchi. ...a tragic accident... ANOTHER LETHAL BALCONY IN MAR DEL PLATA ...that has claimed the life of the actor... Carlita. -Isn't that your buddy? -Go fuck yourself. No, go fuck someone else. ...a joker, always in a good mood... I don't know, there was something about him that radiated hope for a never-ending life. A new job, a smile. Also, miraculously... even though it's painful, the lifeless body... doesn't shock you. A lot of people have gathered... Excuse us, sir. Excuse us, please. Excuse us. Excuse us. Thank you. Here it is. We are at the place... where the body is... He jumped from the 11th floor for reasons that are still unclear. In this time of recollection, Lord, of pain... we pray for our friend, uncle Alfredo, for his sins... and his eternal salvation... so that he may stay with us forever. May the glory of Jesus Christ be with him and never abandon him, Lord. I talked to Silvia yesterday. She said she'd come visit. Did she tell you? Yes, I talked to her. Do you need her to bring you anything? She knows what to bring. Anyway, Dad... take this. -Keep it, son. I'm not going to read it. -I know the Bible by heart. Take it. Bye, Dad. Son. Yeah? Give your mother a kiss. We have a witness who claims to have seen Monzón choking her to death and then throwing her off the balcony. We have a second autopsy that backs up the witness' statement and states that the victim was unconscious when she fell. Everything okay up to there. No remarks. Exactly. All the pieces fit into place. Yes, I know they do. But I feel like these are only the edges of the puzzle. I don't understand what else you're missing, Gustavo. I need you to recheck the report of the second autopsy. Do it before we talk to the press. And go see Dr. Tonini, he was in charge of the first autopsy. Ask for his opinion on this report and why they didn't mention anything about the neck injuries. All right. And while you're at it, ask him if he knows what the hell happened to the missing muscle. Sure. Tell me, don't you think it's weird what goes on in that house? Don't you find it odd? We find a buried weighing scale, a call recorder. The clothes of a suspect go missing. Two weeks later, the best friend falls off a balcony and dies, also with drugs involved. I start investigating, and the mayor tells me to focus on Monzón. The other day, the Turk turns up, and I get the beating of my life. You don't think something's up? No. I don't think it's strange at all. I think the Monzón case is one thing and the drug case is something else, Gustavo. They're not related. Let it go. Stop it. Bye, champion. I'll be out here if you need anything. -How are you, Carlos? -How's it going? That sucks, what happened to Alfredo. -Do you know anything? -No, I don't know anything. Looks like he tripped. Nancy is devastated. There's no way Alfredo fell. What can I say? -Did the guys visit? -Yes. I have news, Carlos. If you're going to tell me that I can speak to Mati, at least over the phone, I'll listen to you. Otherwise, I'm not interested. Mati, yes, we are trying. We are doing everything in our power. We are all working so that you can see Mati again. But not now. You've been telling me that since I was in the hospital. You know what? I don't feel like talking. A witness turned up. He says he saw you. He saw what? A hobo. He says he saw you push her. He says I killed her? He says you threw her off the balcony. What are you going to do? We need to act. Now. First thing you need to do is show good conduct. Don't fight anyone. Be good to your fellow inmates. Help them in everything you can. Do any of your fellow inmates like you? Are they fond of you? All of them. Good. We're going to talk to them and ask them to make a statement saying that you're a good guy, that they appreciate you, that you're good to all your fellow inmates, that you're going through a very hard time with this. And we're going to show this on TV. That way, we will improve your image. -Is that okay with you, Carlos? -No. -No? -No. Whose side are you on, Carlos? Do you want your freedom, or are you on Vargas Rissi's side? I'm about to kick the shit out of you. Yeah? Then go ahead, kick the shit out of me. Hit me. I'm tired of this. Hit the only person who hasn't slept since February 14 because he's looking out for you morning, day and night. I even went to talk to Susana. I'm dedicating my entire life to getting you out of here! I don't eat! I don't sleep! The only thoughts inside my head are, "Monzón, Monzón, Monzón." And what does Monzón want to do? He wants to hit me! Go on, hit me! Hit me! Kick the shit out of me! Come on! Come on, hit me! What did Susana say? That you're incapable of killing anyone. What else? Susana... Carlos. Now, Cholo and Mary are in the truck. Mary wants to get off the truck. Cholo doesn't want to. He makes a joke, they laugh, and they kiss. The dialogue is that short. I just need you to be relaxed, act natural. The camera will be very close to you. -Sierra! -Yes. Take them to the truck. Silence, please. We're about to roll. Attention. Lights! Ready. Sound. Ready. Action! Come in with me. Why? So they can shout insults at me? Come on, you could easily beat them up. You're gonna end up in Ushuaia. Wouldn't you do that for me? Cut! Excellent! You pig! You stuck your tongue out. We don't do tongue in the movies. No tongue, no love. Excellent, Carlos! The kiss was good. Now, Susana, I need you to try harder. You're the professional here. Isn't that right? You have to set the pace for him. You understand? -Yes. -Weren't you looking? -It was good. She was right next to me. -Carlos! Let's do it one more time. -Focus, Susana, okay? -Yes. Mon Dieu. Young people these days... Sierra! Makeup! Who does he think he is talking to you like that? Don't pay attention to him. That's the way he is. Daniel... is red-blooded, but he's the best. And a girl's got to be tame on the set. You, tame? Yes, very tame. If you're tame, I'm Prince Charles. I missed you. I needed you. "Missed you." Yes, "Missed you." What did I say? You need to enunciate. "Missed." Nobody talks like that, Silvita. You be Susana. I love it. -Do you like her? -She's a goddess. Shall we continue? Ever since I met you, I can't be with another woman. "Do you know how bad I feel?" Then why are you avoiding me? "Cholo, I'm so hot right now." I don't understand, Daddy. What does that mean? Is she mad or does she have a temperature? Nothing, sweetie. I know the rest. I'll rehearse by myself. I missed you. I needed you. Ever since I met you, I can't be with another woman. I'll kill you if you lay your hands on another woman. Then why do you get mad? Because you tried to do that to me. -Can't you feel me right now? -What about me? You don't know how hot I feel. Cut! Sierra! Cut. Carlos, where does it say that this scene ends in a kiss? It felt right. It's what Cholo would've done. So now you're Marlon Brando. Let me tell you something. You need to stick to what the script says. Daniel. Sorry. I don't know if Susana told you, but we have an important dinner and she has to come with me. Nobody told me anything. It seems that everyone does whatever they want around here. Fine, we're done. We're done. -Shall we? -Sierra! Come on. Sierra... What are you doing? You can't barge in on us like that. I'm working. Are you kidding? I'm the producer, and we'd agreed I'd come get you. I'm working. I need to concentrate. Stay out of it. Concentrated on that guy ramming his tongue down your throat? Lower your voice. They're going to hear you. I don't care. Let them know you're a little whore. -Get in the car. -No! -Get in the car! -I have to change! I don't care. Change at home. Get in the car. Hey. -Everything all right, Susi? -Yeah. Yes, everything's fine. Everything's fine. "Predatory canid." Four letters. Wolf. "Paraguayan actor by the name of Arnaldo." André. "Cleaves the land with a plow." What the hell... I'm leaving soon. One minute. I'm leaving soon. I'm waiting for someone. There she is. See? Here she is. Airhead. Sorry I took so long. "Hollywood actress from the '60s." Six letters. -Marilyn Monroe? -Yes. Six letters. Perfect. Monroe. Very good, genius. Very good. -Okay... -Put on your seatbelt, please. Tell me. Good news, bad news? Very good news. Two days before Sainz showed up voluntarily in Mar del Plata -to report what he saw... -Yeah? ...an anonymous person opened an account in his name in Buenos Aires. And made a deposit of 20,000 austral. Really? The day after he reported it to the police, another deposit of 10,000 austral was made. Fishy. -Quite fishy. -Very fishy. Yes. Elba? I don't know yet. It's very hard to trace the name of the depositor. I assume they'll have more resources down at the office. -But that's not all. -There's more? Get this. While I was trying to trace the name of the depositor, I had just talked to a friend, a federal officer in the Division of Frauds and Scams, -and he said that today, in Mercedes... -Yeah? ...they took a statement from a guy, the owner of a very important restaurant, who claims to have seen Sainz dumpster diving in the area -the very moment Alicia Muñiz died. -No way. -300 miles away from Pedro Zanni. -That can't be. He made a statement today. -That's really good. -And Parisi doesn't even know. Really good. It was all a lie. You're a genius. Look what I brought. Having your uncle with me will do me good. Thanks, honey. Auntie is not doing good. Champion. Sorry to bother you. Could you sign my wife an autograph? She's a big fan of your movies. What's her name? Florencia. Thanks, champion. What do you know about Mati? Nothing, Dad. I don't know anything. Nothing new. Can't you at least drop by the school? The principal already knows me. Rosello says it's dangerous. She says I can't get near the school or the house. Why the hell does she have to stick her nose in everything? -She's your lawyer. -De Luca is my lawyer. Listen to him. Patricia is a good person. Really? But you can't go near your brother? What, do we have the plague? No, Dad. What happens when you call? Do they answer? Do they hang up? What happens? Same as always. Elba answers it. That old bitch. She wants money. What she got out of me wasn't enough. She wants more. Fucking despicable bitch. What about the custody? Didn't Roberto tell you? No. What? Vargas Rissi made progress with Mati's custody. They almost got it. They still need someone's signature, but they're very close. -No! No! Fucking no! -Dad, stop! -No! -Calm down. Dad, stop! -Calm down. -Let's go. -It's not his fault! -Let go of me! -Don't hurt him! -Let go of me I said! It's not his fault! -Let go of me! -Dad! Let go of me! Susana and Cholo kiss, they turn around and slowly walk out of the church. Their relatives are waving at them, but they keep looking at each other. Yes, I know that part. Was it like that when you married Mommy? Yes, very similar. Yours will be special. Really? I'll make sure it's the best wedding in Santa Fe. What if I don't get married? You'll get married. You'll see. What's the next part? I don't want to, Dad. -What happened? -It says here Susana is naked. I don't want to read it. Never mind. I know that bit. Remember, it's a movie. The cameramen say you kiss her for real. -Who told you that? -The tall one. Show me who it is later, and I'll kick the hell out of him. Are the kisses real? We're acting; they're fake. I think she likes you. Who? Susana, Dad. I don't care. I like Mommy. Daniel. -I have a question. -Yes, Carlos? It says here Cholo takes off his clothes... -Yes? -Does that mean buck naked? Yes, buck naked. She's here. All right, everyone clear the set, please. Only those who are essential can stay. The director, the cameraman and the sound recordist. -You okay? -Much better now that you're here. Carlos, Susana, get ready, please. -Sierra. -Yes. Hold my gum. Don't throw it away. -Lights. -Ready. -Sound. -Working. -Camera. -Rolling. Action. I'm naked. I promised. Undress me. I want to tell you something, Cholo. Don't hold back. Even if I scream, even if it hurts. Don't listen to me. I want to be yours. Make me yours. Yes, Carlos. Yes. Yes! Cut! Cut! The former world champion... is just another inmate living in a cell in one of the blocks... for the non-repeat offenders. The Monzón case has taken a new sharp turn. A few days ago, a key witness turned up, Mr. Sainz, who claimed to have seen Carlos Monzón killing his wife and then throwing her off the balcony. ...the first person to tell us what he saw... WE TALK TO THE HOMELESS MAN'S FRIEND ...or what he allegedly saw. Can you tell us? He said he had seen Monzón open the window, grab her under the arms, drag her, force her against the railing, and then push her down. ALICIA MUÑIZ: MASS HELD IN HER MEMORY "WE HEARD SCREAMS AND THEN THE AMBULANCE" HE KILLED ALICIA MUÑIZ It's very easy to taint someone's image. ROBERTO DE LUCA MONZÓN'S LAWYER Fortunately, when the time comes, justice will determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. I told him he was crazy, that it wasn't possible he saw all that. Your words don't square with Báez's version. No. Not at all. CRIMINAL COURT MONZÓN, CARLOS - HOMICIDE I want you to look at this, Counsel. It's the account that was opened for the homeless man from Buenos Aires. Right after the incident on Pedro Zanni. BATTLE OF LAWYERS Mysterious money transfer to Sainz's account. THE CONTROVERSIAL HOMELESS MAN WITNESSES CONTRADICT SAINZ ...that seemed to be convincing and conclusive for the case, has been brought into question today not only by one witness, but by two. Their versions are completely different. As far as we are concerned, the testimony of this Mr. Sainz is packed with inconsistencies and obscure details. Oddly enough, both deposits are quite large. And I say "oddly enough" because this is a hobo we're talking about, not a surgeon. We're talking about 70,000 austral. That's a lot of money for someone who scavenges for cardboard. And I wonder, where did such an amount of money come from? We're talking about 70,000 austral. I know the name of the person who made those deposits. And if that name gets leaked to the press, all of your witness' lies will become evident. And it is disgraceful that the media is spreading the words of such a questionable person. Disgraceful. And as your colleague, I'd advise you to not bet everything you have on that hobo. Because you think you have an ace of swords in your hand, but that drunkard is merely a four of cups. So what is your opinion about Báez's words? I think he's lying. For this scene, we need a lot of smoke. The alley has to be clear, but... Sierra! Get us a snack or something. We're all starving. -Yes, right away. -Get them something to eat. Follow my lead and keep stalling for as long as you can. So then we'll do a close-up shot on her... Excuse me, Daniel. What? Everyone's hungry. Maybe Alcides can go get us a pizza? Sure, go ahead. Hernán, would you go with him? It's the best slice in Buenos Aires. It'll lift everyone's spirits. Sorry, but I'm working. Come on, I don't know the city. Please. Thanks! Here. Nice. My brother's paying, too. -No, don't worry, I can pay. -No, our treat. Sweetie, do you want to go with uncle Alcides? He'll buy you some ice cream. Go on. Alcides, Silvita's going with you. Go on. Get some socca, too. -I like it crunchy. -You got it. EXPERTS POINT TO CARLOS MONZÓN'S GUILT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER THINKS IT IS A CLEAR CASE OF STRANGULATION Unfortunately, there is more. Alicia's grave must have been desecrated, because the left sternocleidomastoid muscle is missing from her body, which is a muscle located in the neck, and it was stolen with the intention of making it impossible to check whether she was strangled or not. Sorry, Doctor, but can you tell me why... this kind of injury was overlooked during the first autopsy? The thing is that the blow to the head-- Yes, I know that the blow to the head could be the cause of death. But it's different if she was strangled to death before that. And that's what we're trying to clear up. -Because it's-- -I've been doing this for many years. You hadn't been born yet when I started cutting bodies open. The first autopsy was performed flawlessly. Hematoma or ecchymosis on the neck. We reported the injuries in the neck muscles. Fracture of the cranial base. And we based it on the fact that the blow to the head was the cause of death. Then how do you explain that the conclusions differ so much from one another? We're positive that Carlos Monzón murdered his wife. What we have been saying from the beginning has now been proven. The second autopsy was performed on a body that was in an advanced state of decay. A body that had already been manipulated, first by us and then by the funeral parlor. I can't guarantee that the body was in the same condition when it got to Buenos Aires. EXPERTS CONFIRM THE MUSCLE IS MISSING TWO MEDICAL EXAMINERS CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN THE MISSING MUSCLE "THE HOMICIDE HAS BEEN PROVEN" We're having trouble, Patricia. We're always one step behind. They strike, and then we just refute their words when it's too late. It's too late. They start off in the lead. Whoever hits first hits twice. HANDS THAT KILL This proves that Monzón... TORN JUGULAR VEIN ...strangled his wife, the mother of his son, then threw her off the balcony and then jumped. Is there anything you can tell me about the missing muscle? The sternocleidomastoid muscle was in its place when I worked on the body. Either way, that muscle wouldn't prove anything. What matters is whether Monzón killed her or not. And right now, people's opinion is that Monzón killed her. They don't care about the evidence. They don't care about anything. If a doctor on television says that he strangled her, people believe he strangled her. We refute that afterwards, but then it's too late. We need to plan our next step carefully, Patricia, because we're struggling. We have conclusive proof... ALICIA WAS DEAD WHEN SHE FELL ...that we brought into the case after the second autopsy. This proof has a major impact on the case. No longer simple, but aggravated homicide. So, is it viable? It's tricky. Look, I need some time to read all this. And I have to talk to my colleague down at the UVA, but... the truth is... I have my doubts about her being strangled. The report is quite clear. It says, "Death by strangulation." There's no room for doubt. Well, it's not that simple. Okay, one thing at a time. When there's a momentary neck or throat compression, there's usually a decompensation. It can be transient, but if it is long-lasting, it can cause death. So there is a direct connection between the time of compression and the occurrence. Now, I do not see any indication of that being the case here. -Do you understand? -No. Speak in layman's terms, because I don't get it. If you're strangled, you shit yourself before you die. You shit yourself? You shit yourself. That's how the body reacts. Well, I didn't know that. You'd have to find out if they found any traces of excrement. Aren't you afraid? What do you mean? I mean, if they find out, they'll drive us mad. So? -What do I care? -You don't get it. What don't I get? I have a boyfriend. So? -I'm married. -No, it's not the same. You're a man. You're the champion. I'm a woman and a divorced single mother. And from now on, a slut, too. Hey. Hey. I want you to leave him. -Why? -What do you mean, "Why?" You know why. First chance you get, you'll just leave me for someone else. No, I mean it. I don't want other women. You don't think I know that girls line up at your door? I'm not stupid, you know? I want to be with you. We can date and do anything you want. I don't know. Hernán is so good to me. He helps me a lot. Leave him, baby. I'll give you everything. -And more. -What about you? -What? -Santa Fe. I'm done with Santa Fe. -I practically live here. -Hey, I'm not stupid. I'll clear things up with Pelusa. You will? Yes. Really, you will? Really, I will. Hello? Raúl! What are you doing, baby? Where are the kids? At my dad's. Look what I got for them. Should I go get them? Hey. I can explain. No, I'll explain what's going on. I'm an idiot! -Stop! -That's what's going on. I'm an idiot. I put up with your boxing, with your shit, your women, your drinking, and you do nothing for me! But I won't put up with you cheating on me. Stop. Put that knife away so we can talk. Put the knife away? -Are you afraid I'll cut your balls off? -Get out of here. You don't even have balls. Go away, Carlos. Go on, you're free. You're free to be with that slut, your fancy clothes and your fucking friends from TV. Just leave me alone, you hear me? Don't ever bother me or the kids again. We're too good for you. Baby, I love you. You're the love of my life. But what happened to me... I don't know how to explain it. But it happened. Forgive me, baby. I don't want an explanation. Just go. Go away, Carlos. Subtitle translation by Arturo Fernández
