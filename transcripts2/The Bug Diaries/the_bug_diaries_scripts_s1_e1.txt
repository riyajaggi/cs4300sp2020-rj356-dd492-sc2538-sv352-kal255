 and Spider needed boots to keep his eight feet warm how many boots would they need altogether? Uhm.../ Uh.../ Oh! - Spider! The answer is... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Hey! Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.. ..thirteen, fourteen! Fourteen! Fourteen boots! Yep! / That's right! / Yeah! Fourteen! Nice problem-solving, Spider! Now, let's say we add... ..100 maggots!

 How many winter boots do they need for all their feet? Ha, ha! Trick question, Mrs. Mulch! Maggots don't have feet. Just ask my baby sisters! Wonderful, Fly! What is that? - THAT sounds like... - MOOKIE! Brace yourselves, buglets! Whoaaa! Ughhh! That's the THIRD time this week. Everyone safe? Yes? Well then, let's put our school back together again, Buglets. Thanks guys. If Mookie keeps interrupting class, I'll never get to start the edaphology lesson! But I can't wait! My moms say we'll use edaphology all the time in our adult lives! There's peat soil, that's the smelly kind. And then there's loam. Loam is my favorite. I could talk about loam all day! He really can! BUM-BA-BA-BUMMMMM! Don't worry, Mrs. Mulch. FLY GIRL will find a way to make that clumsy canine BUZZ OFF. I knew I could count on you, Fly! You're a real star pupa! And THAT, dear Diary, is how the incredible Fly Girl began her quest to bring an end to the great canine catastrophe. But she needed some help from her trusty insect sidekicks... Actually, worms are annelids, not insects. And Spiders are arachnids! How about... "But she needed some help from her annelid and arachnid allies!" Much better. So, what's the plan to stop Mookie? Simple! We're going to do what bugs do best. Let me explain. Today is the dawn of a new era of dog-free peace and safety for our school. Keep it up, Spider! Just a little more webbing over here! No prob, Fly! Spinning webs IS what I do best! There! This web-link fence should keep the Mookster out. Nice work, webhead! Let's get inside. Mrs. Mulch is finally going to start the edaphology lesson. Buzztastic! Morning, buglets! Who's ready to dig in to edaphology? Get it? Dig in to edaphology! On account of it's the study of soil? - Good one, Mrs. Mulch! - Thank you. But...where's everyone else? Yeah! Mrs. Mulch? What on earth?! No! My web fence couldn't keep Mookie out, but it DID keep everyone else out! Aghhh / Ughh / Yuk! No dog is going to get in the way of us bugs learning! Fly Girl is just getting started here. That's it, guys! Nice slimin'! Er, don't suppose you could go just a teeny bit faster? Slow and slimy wins the race. Finished! This super-slick slime ring will send Mookie slipping all over the place the next time he tries to knock over our school. Next time, as in...right now?! ...guys? Ruff! Guess the slime wasn't slippery enough. Class dismissed. But that means no edaphology lesson. Maybe we should start looking for a new school-house. Somewhere Mookie can't get to. Like in a tree. Or under a rock. Or... No way! This is OUR school-house. And we're on a quest to defend it. But we can't keep Mookie away forever. It's impossible. Nothing's impossible when Fly Girl is around. I just need a new idea. Good boy! Now, sit. Good doggy! Shake! Good boy! Mookie listens to Lucas! Maybe he'll listen to us? Hurry, bugs! This way! What, are we gonna ask Mookie to stop knocking over our school? That's exactly what we're gonna do! When Lucas tells Mookie to do something, Mookie understands and does what he says, right? So we're gonna march right up to that big shaggy ear of his, and ask him to stop knocking over our school! ...I hate to say it, but that sounds kinda impossible! Of course it does! All amazing superhero quests sound "kinda impossible" at first. That's what makes them amazing! Do you REALLY think Mookie's gonna do what we ask him? Only one way to find out! Uhhhh! Who knew Mookie was so shaggy? Or so filthy? I think someone needs a bath. Okay, so which way to the ears? I think this way leads to Mookie's head, and this way leads to his tail. Or is it the other way around?! What was that?! It's coming from over there! I can feel it in my trichobothria. Now it's coming from over there! Look! Bugs, I think it's coming from right over... Hey, bugs! - Whoopsie! Didn't mean to scare ya. - Hi, Flea. Nice day? Not too hot, not too cold. Perfect day for a ride, ain't it? Hey, what are YOU doing up here on Mount Mookie, anyway? We're on a quest. Ooooh, a quest! I love quests. Long quests, short quests, any kind of quests! What kind are you on?! We're on our way up to Mookie's ear... Oooh,that's a nice spot! To ask him to stop knocking over our school! Ask him? You think a dog's gonna listen to a bug? He'll listen to this bug! I think you'll find that Fly Girl can be very persuasive. That's for sure! Okay, enough chit-chat. We gotta keep moving! What's the matter, you lost? Hey, better let ole Flea help you out! You know the way to Mookie's ear? 'Course I do... Then you'll make the perfect fur guide, Flea! Lead the way. I'd be delighted, my buzzy little buddy! No one knows their way around this dog better than me. Cause I'm a flea. Hey, that rhymed. Me, flea! Now what were we talking about? You were telling us how you... Yeah. A dog makes a perfect home for us fleas. The thick hair on his belly keeps us cozy in the winter. And his big floppy ears give us shade in the summer. In fact, I spend almost all my time right here on Mount Mookie. Follow me. Mookie's left ear is just up ahead. Mookie! Sounds like Lucas again! C'mon, boy, time for your BATH! Mookie! Yeeee-haw! Hang on tight, everybuggy! Wah / Whoa / Aggh! Hey, wait for me! Whoooa! Yee-hee-ha! Isn't this great? I could ride around on this dog all day! Don't stop now, Mookie! It's a little bouncy. - Ain't it though? - Does he always go this fast? - Faster, sometimes! - Great. Awww, he stopped. He stopped! Aw, c'mon Mookie! I thought you loved getting a bath! Ha-ha! Here we go again! Here we go again. Hang on, Worm! Easy for you to say. You have eight legs to hang on with! That dog REALLY does not want to take a bath! / Hah! Whaaaa? Insect Superhero, comin' through! Fly Girl will save the day! Fly! You missed the whole thing. Mookie was running like wild and we were hanging on and Mookie was like, 'Whoa!' And we were all like, And wasn't it bugtastic, guys? Yeah! Yeah. Bugtastic. Did you get a chance to ask Mookie about the schoolhouse? Um, we were kinda busy. Hanging on for dear life and stuff. We haven't even made it to his ear. Fly, shouldn't we be thinking about getting back? Mrs. Mulch is probably starting to get worried about us. Getting back? Are you kidding? We haven't finished our quest. When Fly Girl starts something, she finishes it. We've got a schoolhouse to save. Come on! Bugs, there it is! One big, furry dog ear, straight ahead! Yeah. That's his ear alright. Me and my family used to vacation here when I was a kid! Hi Mookie! Long time fan, first time rider. - Ruff? - It's working. Mookie hears you! Go on, Fly! Listen Mookie, would you please stop knocking over our school? I promised Mrs. Mulch I'd get you to stop. It's been driving her up the wall. It would be a huge favor if you stopped, Mookie. Really. Whoaaa! What's he doing? I think ole Mookie hears ya, but he can't see ya. But we've got one confused canine on our hands. So much for my big idea. Maybe talking to dogs is just not a Fly Girl superpower. Don't give up now, Fly. If we don't stop Mookie, we'll never get to learn edaphology. The whole class is counting on you. Yeah, if anyone can get through to that dog, it's you. You're right. I just need to think up a new, even better, even bigger idea! Fly Girl...superthink! I got nothing. I know you'll think of something. After all, you're Fly Girl. You can do the impossible. Maybe I'll think of something on the way home. ...bugs? How exactly do we get home? Mookie carried us a long way. Easy, fleasy! We rode Mookie out here, we can just ride him back. But Mookie seems to go where he wants. And he doesn't seem very motivated to go anywhere right now. Maybe we can motivate him to get moving. Yeah! Motivate the Mookster. I like it! And there's only one thing Mookie really loves. - Tummy rubs? - Old shoes? Barking at that one bush with all the noisy birds in it? Okay, so maybe there's a few things. But the thing Mookie REALLY loves, is chewing on doggy bones. A doggy bone? Of course! What's a doggy bone? And more importantly, where are we gonna find one? The whole neighborhood is full of 'em. Mookie buries 'em all over the place, underground! Did you say...underground? Be right back! OK, Mookie, let's see what you've got under here. ...- ha! Hey! Ha! Bingo! I know! This doggy bone is perfect. No, I mean that looks like a bone Bingo buried. He's the dog down the street. But I'm sure he won't mind if we borrow it. Uhhhh...he still doesn't seem very motivated. Bum-Ba-Ba-Bummm! Fly girl just got another bugtastic idea! We can lead Mookie home with that bone! - Hey! - Yee-hee-ha! Great work, everybuggy. Now, we've just got to figure out how to wake Mookie up. Oooh! Leave that to me. It's my favorite part. Watch. Flea tickle! It's working! He's gonna chase that bone all the way home. Should be smooth sailing from here, me hearties! He's heading straight for the school! Okay, crew. Time to drop anchor. Let's get to work. ...there! Ruff! Ruff! Alright, we made it! Thanks for the lift, Mookie! That was great! Let's go for another ride soon. Yeah. We'll be in touch. Thanks again. FLY! You're back. And Mookie didn't knock over the school this time, ha! Have you really solved our little Mookie problem for good? You see, the thing about that... Yup, Mrs. Mulch! Fly Girl has done the impossible yet again, and she found a way. She did? The answer was right in front of our faces, or, Mookie's face, the whole time! Mookie just needs a little more motivation and we're gonna need a lot more doggy bones. So cool! Nothing's impossible when Fly Girl's around! Alright my brilliant little buglets. Ready for another one? Fly Girl has the situation well under control. Wonderful, Fly! Boing! Ughhh...ha, ha, ha! Nice work! Anytime Mookie gets close, we'll send a bone flying. And then, the Mookster will chase the bone away from the school! Very impressive! Load the launcher! Come on. Let's go. - Ruff! - The school is safe. Yay! / Alright! / Woo-hoo! It worked. Int actually worked! Of course it worked. Once Fly Girl starts a quest, she never gives up, no matter how impossible it seems. Though sometimes she does need a little help from her annelid and arachnid allies. High-fives! Low-fours! Middle! Tail bumps! Mookie, there you are. Time to get you clean once and for all. Bath time! That's my cue. See ya, poochie pal. Come on, you dirty doggie. Alright, my little buglets. Now who's ready to learn... Edaphology! Yeah! / Woo-hoo! / Alright! And so, once again, through super flying and super thinking Fly Girl...Bum-ba-ba-bum! Achieved the impossible. And what she learned was that to do the impossible, sometimes you have to try a whole bunch of things that don't work before you find something that does work. And to get to the answer, sometimes you have to go the long way around to wind up in the place where you really need to be. But when your goal is really important, it's all worth it. So ends another amazing adventure. And so begins your next amazing adventure. What are you gonna draw in your Bug Diary?
