 HO, HO! Snow! Look at those webbulous ice crystals. Worm and Fly have to see this! Hey, Sport. Where are you scurrying in such a hurry? To find Worm and Fly so we can play in the sno- What's going on? Winter's coming and this year, we're going to do something a little different. Your father thought that instead of sheltering outside in the cold and wet, like usual, we might spend the winter indoors. A vacation indoors? You mean...

 ..in there? Well, yeah. But...but, what about my web? My stuff? You'll have a new web, and new stuff. What about my friends? What about Fly and Worm? You'll make new friends. And you'll see Fly and Worm again in the spring. The spring?! That's practically forever! It's going to be wonderful, son. You'll see. Well...can I at least go say goodbye? Of course, sweetie. Brrr...the snow is c-cold! Wait! You forgot your mittens! Thanks, Mom! Whoaaa! Whoaaa! Hey, Fly. Gimme a second. I just found out we'll be spending the winter in- Hey! Spider! Fly! I'm helping my moms gather yummy food for the winter. We're stockpiling moldy newspapers to snack on. The comic strips are my favorite. This winter's gonna be great, don't ya think, Spider?! Not for me. Dad decided we're gonna spend the winter inside this year. Inside? Inside what? Inside the house! Which means I'm going to have to leave my web and my stuff, and I won't see you guys till spring. Spider, that's terrible. Time's a-wastin', Sport! The "great indoors" awaits! Great. Well, bugs, I guess this is it. Bye, Wormy. I sure am gonna miss those slimy segments of yours. Hang in there, Spider. You'll be fine. I sure hope you're right, Fly. In we go! Look at this place! A spider paradise. So dark and gloomy. Just the way we like it! Yep! I think we have found our winter home. Honey, it's just so beautiful! I miss Fly and Worm. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again - ooff!! Worm! Worm! Worm! Hi Fly! Hi Spi... Yeah. Just you and me now, Yup, I guess so. How's the new winter burrow coming along? Really good, we're digging extra deep. I can't wait to snuggle down in our new space. Feel like a visitor? Weeee! This is more like it. Waaaahhhh! Ngggh! Fly, I don't think you're gonna be doing much flying this winter. It's just not aerodynamically possible in this weather. But I have to fly. My name is Fly. It's what I do! Not in winter. It's too cold outside. You said so yourself. You're right. It is too cold outside to fly. But it's nice and warm inside! C'mon Worm. We're taking a little trip. ...where are we going? To visit Spider! Follow me! Or I can follow you. You know, Sweetheart, this may be our best web ever. Where's Spider? Setting up his web, I think. Knock knock! How's our little Mr. Muffet doing? Okay, I guess. Back home I had my web just the way I like it, with all my favorite treasures and trinkets and thingamabugs. But in here... Well, maybe you can collect some nice things around here to make this place seem more like home. I guess. But what I want most, are my friends. And they're not here. Do you feel that warm air? Ohhhh, I'll go first. Hey, I'm flying! Your turn! I'm too big! Then make yourself not big! ...mmfff! That wasn't so hard. Hey, I can see Spider's vacation home down there. He's gonna be SO surprised to see us. Let's go! - Whoaaa! - Worm! Fly Girl to the rescue. She's here! Ooof! Wait, no! No, no, no, no, no! - She's there! - Whoaaa!! Fly Girl is everywhere! Oof! Hey, hold still will ya? Whaaa! Oof... If I can just... Let me try to... Hi Spider. Worm! Fly! I told you he'd be surprised! What are you bugs doing here? ...just thought we'd... ...buzz by to play together one more time. Webtastic! Plus, Fly can't fly in the cold. Yes, I can! Wait, you're right. I can't. Well, why-ever you're here, I'm sure glad you came. Hey, you wanna help me collect cool stuff for my new web? You know, to make it feel more like home? If that's even possible. Fly Girl and Wormy-worm are here to assist! Yeah! If any three bugs can find spiderifficky stuff it's us! Yeah! Mom! I'm gonna go collect stuff for my new web with Fly and Worm. Okay, Sweetie! Just stay indoors, and be back in time for dinner! Where shall we look first? Shall we? I don't know what we're gonna find up there, but okay. Wait up, bugs! This is definitely the way to travel. Whoaaa! What IS all this? I don't know, but this place could be FULL of cool stuff Y'know, human stuff. For your winter web. Like that. Wow! Whaddya think, Spider? I think I love it. Oops! Maybe we can find something a little lighter. What did you say, Fly? I didn't say anything. Well, I sure feel something. - Whoaaa! - Monster! This way, bugs! Err...maybe this way. Under here! It's not giving up. ...ooompf! Quick thinking, Worm! How'd you know that would make it go away? Well, I know I'm always in a better mood after I've had something to eat! Sheesh. Indoors is a weird place! Ew, look at all the filth under here. Yeah, it's not like this at home. And it's a little dry for me. ...aitchoo! This dust likes sticking to my slime! You look great Worm! Yeah, it's a dusty-do. Thanks. Not quite my style. But maybe we'll find something cool for your web in here. Something just ran by. ...I don't think we're alone. There! Where? Yikes! Hello? Anybody here? Whaaahhhh! Wait a second. - Cockroach? - Worm? Spider? Fly? Hey, what are you bugs doin' here? My Mom and Dad and I came indoors for a vacation. You don't say? Me and my family spend EVERY winter here. Every summer, spring and fall too! You mean, YOU live here? Yep, there's nothing like it. And nothin' like five year-old tortilla chips encrusted with dust. Yum! So what're you bugs up to? We're helping Spider collect fun stuff for his winter web, so it feels more like home. Only we haven't gotten anything yet. Lookin' for cool stuff? I'll show ya where all the BEST stuff in the whole house is! C'mon! He's even faster than me. And I've got two more legs! Welcome, bug buds, to my very favorite place: the kitchen! But there's nothing here. That's what you think. Follow me. There's always cool stuff up here. See? You ain't seen nothin' yet. C'mon! Let's go explore. Zoom! Hup! Jackpot! What'd I tell you bugs?! Sweet. Well, it is fun in here, but I can't exactly decorate my new web with food. It would just rot away. Bluergh! Almost ate the wrapper. Oooh. Now THIS I love. It'll make a spideriffic poster for my new webwall! Great find, cockroach. - Are you hungry? - I'm starving. Run for your lives! Let's see. I think we've got some apples and... Look! Leftover pizza! Wait, I almost forgot. My poster! A spider! Get it away! Get it away! Easy, Cody. Sorry, didn't mean to scare you! See? He's kinda cute! Uhm...hi there. I'll just put this little guy outside, where he belongs. Outside? OUTSIDE? There ya go, little spider. What are we gonna tell Spider's mom? He's supposed to stay indoors! This looks like a job for Fly Girl! BUM-BA-BA-BUMMM!! Zooooom! Don't worry, Spider. I'll save you! On second thought, it's too cold out there for you. I think you'd better spend the winter inside. Just don't tell Cody. Bye. Spider, you okay? I'm fine. That Lucas kid is pretty nice. Yeah. Looks like you'll also have a human friend in here this winter. Wow! I didn't expect to meet a new friend. I wonder what else we can find indoors? Let's look! You may not have found anything for your web, but this place is full of surprises. The monster! Run! Whoooaa! Where are we? Wherever it is, it's playing havoc with my mucus membranes. I- I-I think we're inside the monster! Oooh, sorry ‘bout the dust, guys. There's usually a lot more of it. But you know what they say, some days are dustier than others! Who are you? Excuse me. Dusty. Dusty the dust mite! Pleased to make your acquaintance. What are you doing inside this monster? Ho-ho, well, it's not a monster. It's a duster-sucker-upper! I get sucked up in here all the time. Well, my family just moved in here for the winter. Fly and Worm and I have been trying to collect stuff for my new web. I haven't had much luck, though. We-he-hell! Your luck's about to change. Feast your peepers on this. Now THAT'S what I call a collection! Oooh, what's this? Not sure. But look what it does. I might need a little help here. - Okay then. - Sure. Oooh, I like it. It's all yours! I can keep it? Really? Take anything you like, new neighbor. We get a fresh haul in here every day. Well, gee. I like this...and this. And this looks spideriffic too. Thanks, Dusty. You're welcome. Anytime. Say, you should come by the sofa cushion later for dinner! Thanks, Dusty, but I promised my Mom I'd be home around now. Wormy and I have to get home too. Gotta hunker down for the winter. And get used to walking. Don't worry Fly, I'll walk with you. It's always good to have a friend close by. Thanks, Wormy. You come back and visit sometime. You can count on it. Thanks again! ...how do we get out of here? Well then, right this way. Waaayyy! - Oof! - Oops! DUSTY - Bye, bye! Hey, cockroach! Sorry about back there in the kitchen. When lights come on, we're gone. It's just instinct. That's okay. Looks like somebody could use a hand. - Spideriffic! - Buzztacular! It's going to be great having you here this winter. I can already tell we're gonna have lots of fun. I think you're right, there's so much to explore here. - Thanks for your help. - Yeah, thanks, Cockroach. That looks great. How about this? Yeah! - Hi Mom and Dad. - Did you kids have fun exploring? Yeah. I met a friend from school, and made some new friends, too. And we thought there was a monster, but it was only a duster-suckerupper. And look at all this cool new stuff we found for my web! Fantastic, sport! That's wonderful, sweetie! I'm gonna keep on making it nice and cozy. Now your winter digs look and sound super-webbulous. Thanks, guys. Couldn't have done it without my best bug buds! You know, maybe this winter won't be so bad after all! Yeah! With all these new treasures, it's going to be incredible. Then I guess our work here is done! Time to get back to my burrowing. Yeah, the cold air is calling me. Well, if it ever gets too chilly, come back for another visit. We just might do that. I sure am gonna miss you bugs! We're gonna miss you, too. But you'll be all right. Yeah. I think I will be. Bye bugs! - Bye! - See you in the spring! Dear Diary: I thought I was gonna be lonely this winter. But instead, I've met lots of new friends, explored a WHOLE exciting new world inside the house. And found lots of cool stuff for my new collection. Who knew that coming indoors would be so much fun? So ends another amazing adventure. And so begins your next amazing adventure!
