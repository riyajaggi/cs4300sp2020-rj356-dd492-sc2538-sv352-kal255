 Dear Diary, Bom-ba-ba-ba-bom! Zoom! Tail bumps! Wheee! Mookie! Buzz-tastic! - Wheee! - Whee...yeah! - Heeyah...whee! - Woohoo! - Hello, Spider. - Hi, Mrs. Fly. Wouldn't it be wonderful if my friends could fly like me? Worm and Spider and I could go zipping and zooming

 all over the place. Fly, aren't you gonna come play hide and seek? Of course! Let's go! Zoom! Hi Fly. Are you bugs ready? - Yeah! - Mmhmm. Let's see who's gonna be it. Gooey gloopy grimy goo! Moldy papers, I love to chew. If it's slimy stinky stew. I will eat it, how about you! Gulp! My mamas told me to... ..pick the smelliest one and that one is you!

 I guess I'm it. - Yes! - Hide! - One...two... Three...four... Five...six... Seven...eight...nine... Ten...eleven... Twelve...thirteen... Fourteen...fifteen... Sixteen...seventeen... - Eighteen...nineteen...twenty! - Wahhh! Ready or not, here I come. Now...Spider likes places that are dark and dry. Ha! Gotch...ughhh! Hi Spider! That's one. Now where's... Here I am! Here I am! What?! You really have to try harder, Fly. I'm good at flying, not waiting. Hey, I have an idea! What if we play "I Spy in the Sky"?! - But we can't fly. - Right. Wait, what if we play "Dodge a screen door" in Lucas's kitchen?! We can't fly. How 'bout we go up to the roof and... - We can't fly! - Okay, okay! I guess we'll just play hide and seek again. Sure would be better if you bugs could fly, though. We can't all be flies, Fly. Nor would we want to. I guess I'm "it," One... Two... Seven... Hey! Three... four... Five...six... I'll show 'em. I'm gonna find the best hiding place ever. And I'm not coming out until they find me. If they find me. Yeah! Great hiding place! And yummy, too! Worm! - Caught me! - Great hiding place. If I hadn't stepped on you, I never would have found you! Now, where is Fly? Oof! That was weird. Okay, to find Fly, we need to think like Fly. Right! And if I were a fly, I would hide... Somewhere up high. Where are those guys?! Here I am! Here I... Where am I? Wow! Am I dreaming? You couldn't dream a smell like that! Spider! Worm! You gotta get a load of this place! - Hello! - Is somebody there? You can't hide from my compound eyes! - Just me! - Who said that?! Me! Flygo Flyski, at your service. You're a fly. But you look so different! I'm a blue bottle fly. This is blue bottle country. What is this place anyway? - It's the City Dump. - "City Dump"? Yeah, the City Dump. Where humans bring their garbage, not from just one house, but from hundreds of houses, thousands of houses, tens of thousands of houses, hundreds of thousands of houses, millions of houses! - Really?! - Yep. All that garbage. And it's ours. All ours. Come on, I'll show you around. Wow, you fly just as fast as me! - Faster, I'll bet! - Ha! When it's hot and humid like this, with no breeze, it's particularly putrid. - I love it! - Who wouldn't? Zoom! Watch your wings! Woohoo! Ha, ha, ha! Ooooh! Hey, you can walk upside-down too! - You can do everything I can do! - Yep! Corn syrup. Careful, it's sticky. Sticky as one of Spider's webs. But a lot yummier! You find something new here every day. Usually something soupy, sweet and totally rotten. Spider and Worm would never do this! Who exactly are this Spider and Worm? They're my friends. They can't fly, though. Boy, I wonder if they've found me yet! Well, we can now say we have left no stone unturned in our search for Fly. Maybe it was a mistake to keep telling her she should try harder. Yeah, I think she definitely tried way too hard. You know, Fly really likes to walk upside down. She also likes sweet, sugary things. Look! It always amazes me how humans throw things just anywhere. Yeah, with all their junk lying around, I'm surprised there's any room at all for us bugs. I move we elect Andy president! - YAY! - Fly? Do you mind? We have Ant business to deal with here! Oops! Sorry about that. Where could Fly be? Flygo, this place is unbelievable! But I think I'd better be getting home. My friends are definitely going to be wondering where I am. Aaaw. I wanted you to meet my family! Okay. I guess a few more minutes won't hurt. This way. Wow! Come on! Fly, these are my cousins Renzo and Grindal. My Uncle Simon, my sister Simone, my brother Silchester. Hi. Pleased to meet you. My Aunt Gloria, Uncle Jerry, my brothers Xerxes, Pericles and Siphon. My cousin Roger, my cousin Antoinette, my sister Sue. Hello, hi! How ya doing? My cousin Neil, my second cousin Arnie, my nephew Flashmark, Flashmark's Aunt Ida... Hi! Hello. My sisters Sarah, Saray and Sandra. My Uncle Vic, my brother Waldorf. Wow! Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi! - And hello! - And there's more this way! Wow, Flygo. You have as many relatives as I do! Yeah, well, that was just a few of them. I can't believe I've found a friend just like me. You're a fly, I'm a fly. You love flying, I love flying. You've got a big family, I've got a big family. We are kind of alike, aren't we? Get ready, 'cause now you're gonna meet my Grammy Ludmilla. Ludmilla? Well, hello there. Who might you be? Grammy Ludmilla, this is my friend Fly. She's... A house fly, if I'm not mistaken? That's right, ma'am. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Nice to meet you, young lady. We don't get a lot of house flies here. Probably because this isn't a house, it's a dump! What's that? Come on! No! My goodness, what happened? Your whole house has fallen apart! Think nothing of it! We would've had to rebuild today, anyway. This is the Day of Uncovering. The Day of Uncovering? Yeah, every week the Big Yellow Pushy Thing comes and pushes away this whole mountain. That's terrible! You see, when all this stuff gets pushed away, it uncovers all the really rotten, stinky, juicy garbage that's been stewing underneath for days, or weeks, or months! - Yum! - "Yum" is right. There's a huge feast, and flies come from all over the dump. Can Fly come? Of course she can come! I wouldn't hear of her not coming! A feast? You know, maybe Worm and Spider can keep on looking for me just a little longer. - Where is the Snuzzip? - Oops! With meeting Fly and all, I sort of forgot. Sorry Grammy. We'll go get it right away. Come on, Fly. We've got a Snuzzip to find! - A what? - It's a pink, wavy thing. Kind of like your hair bow. We put it up so flies all over the dump can see where the feast is. Hurry Flygo and new friend! Without the snuzzip there's no feast! Not there. I don't see anything pink. Not here either. - What are these? - Old newspapers. Kinda wet and moldy. Careful you don't get stuck on 'em. I've never seen so many... Worm would love this place! ...no snuzzip. That's weird. Come on. See anything? No pink wavy thing around here. This looks familiar. You know, if we just flew straight, we could keep track of where we've been and where we haven't been. Who wants to fly straight? Just a thought. With both of us using our thousand eyeballs, we're certain to find it. But Spider would make a spiderific web on these things! "Hello! Hello! Nice echo. but no Snuzzip. C'mon! One more place to look. Spider and Worm would both love this! It's dark, and it's wet, and that echo would tickle their trichobothria and slimy segments! I wonder if they're still looking for me? I've got it! I know where she is! Remember how Fly always gets excited about shiny metal things? Curvy shiny metal things especially! So this has GOT to be it. Come on out, Fly! We've found you! Fly! Fly?! I don't understand it. She HAD to be here. We're never gonna find her. Yes, we are! You know why? Because she's our best friend. You're right. I mean it's not like she could be miles away or anything. - Wait, Flygo! Is that it? - What? - Is that the snuzzip? - Yes! Fly, your slow-motion fly vision is really on the ball! Let's hear it for the high flicker fusion frequency! High-fives! Low-fours! Tail bumps! Brother! Never mind. We found it. Come on, race ya! And you're right. It is the same color as my hair-bow. Look out! If we don't get out of here, we can't put up the snuzzip, and no one will know where to come for the feast. A little help? - Oooh! - Aghhh! How are we going to get out? If Worm were here, he'd squish up his body and squeeze through those bars like this. Or he'd dive into the ground and eat his way out. You know, make a tunnel. Nope. We're not gonna be eating our way out of this one. Okay, what would Spider do? He'd collect some cool things and then turn them into a thinga-ma- jig. - An invention? - Yeah! That we could use to get... OUCH! Flygo, give me a hand! I think I've invented a thinga-ma-jig to get us out of here. Spider would probably wrap it with a web-strand and make it even better, but this just might work. What are we gonna do with it? Dig a tunnel, just like Worm! Only without the eating part. Buzztastic! Fly, you're the cleverest bug ever! If you think I'm clever, you should meet my friends, Spider and Worm! They do things like this all the time! Come on, we don't want to miss that feast! It's feasting time! Look at all that yummy muck! Now, we hang the snuzzip! Now everyone will know where to come to eat! Come on! - Grammy! - You did good with the Snuzzip, Flygo. You wouldn't believe Fly! She made this crazy diggy thing! And then she used it to dig a tunnel right through the garbage to get us out from under a box! A diggy thing?! A tunnel?! Fly, you are a wonder of nature! Who's a wonder are Worm and Spider. They're my best bug buds and the ones who taught me all this stuff. You are friends with a worm and a spider? They're my best friends. And I gotta get back to them! What are they gonna think happened to me?! But gosh, how am I gonna get back? I'm not even sure where home is from here. Don't worry, little Fly. We have our ways of getting around. Don't we, Flygo? When you have had your fill of all this gloppy goodness, Flygo will show you the way. Let's eat! You can go anywhere in the whole city on these things. Let's see...number 8-2-6 is the one you want. Fly, this has been so much fun! I'm so glad I met you! Me too, Flygo. Don't forget me! Forget you? After the adventure we had? I'm gonna think of you every time I go to find a snuzzip. There's your ride. Better fly! Goodbye! You were right, Spider. We have looked everywhere. All I can think is, Fly doesn't want to be found. I'm here! I'm here! - Fly! - You're here! You're here! High-fives! Low-fours! Middle-sixes! Tail bumps! You must have found the best hiding spot ever! You have no idea. Wait till I tell you! So then I took the diggy thing - it was just like you would have invented, Spider! And we made this Worm-y tunnel right out of there. You'd have been so proud of me! And when we got back there really was this huge feast. It was so totally beyond amazing! I was really wishing you both were there to see it. You wouldn't have believed it! You're right. We don't believe it. Yeah, c'mon, Fly. An ocean of garbage? I think we took so long to find you that you fell asleep and started dreaming. No, I... Golly, could I have dreamed it? Flygo! Fly, your bow fell off when you left the dump. Are these the famous Worm and Spider? Famous? I guess we're more well-known that we thought. Fly could not stop talking about you two! She thinks you are the most brilliant, wonderful-est bugs in the whole world! Flygo, since you're here, I gotta show you around my neighborhood! Come on, everybody! Making new friends who can fly as fast as me and go all over the place like me is great. But it's my old friends, my best friends, who are the greatest. Even if they different from me. No, wait! They're the greatest BECAUSE they're different from me! I guess maybe it's our differences that make our life so interesting. And let us have such fantastic adventures! Speaking of fantastic adventures, so ends another one. And so begins your next amazing adventure. What are you going to draw in your Bug Diary?
