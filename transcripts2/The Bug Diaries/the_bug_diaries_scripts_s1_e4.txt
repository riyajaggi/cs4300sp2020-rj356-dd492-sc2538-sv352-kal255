 Dear Diary, Bom-ba-ba-ba-bom! Zoom! Tail bumps! Wheee! Smoky! Buzz-tastic! Hey! Dear Diary... Mrs. Mulch taught us a new word in school yesterday. "Annelid". It means "a worm" in Latin. So officially, I'm an annelid.

 Sur-prise! It's story time! Liddy! I just wrote that page. But it's delicious. Why can't you eat your own stuff? Because I like to eat YOUR stuff. But you have a whole compost pile on your side of the room. I like being with you, Worm. Wanna hear a song I made up? Hug-da-bug, hug-da-bug... I'd rather be by myself, if you don't mind. I wanna read my comics. Guess what I am? A bookworm!

 Tell me a story, Worm. I love when you tell me stories. Once upon a time, there was a little worm, who always asked her brother to tell her stories and it drove him nuts. Because he just wanted a small cave to himself. So she finally stopped asking and he was very, very happy. The end. No! Tell me the one about the little girl worm, that always makes my heart go, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump. Okay, I'll tell you the story. If, you close your eyes and lie down in your bed. Hey! Slippery. Little sisters, yeesh! I just need my OWN room. If my moms will let me. Moms! One more piece and our puzzle will be finished. This is my FAVORITE part. Honey, do the honors. - Honey? - I think we're missing a piece. Not for long! Ha! Found it. ...cool. - Hi Wormy. - Hi Anna. Moms... Why the long face? I'm a worm. We all have long faces. So what's bugging you, sweetie? Sharing a room with Liddy is hard. She always wants me to tell her a story. Her stuff is always on my side and she ate a page of my Bug Diary. I need my own room where I can read by myself and have my stuff the way I want it. I mean, providing you think so too. And I'm guessing that's a "no." Actually, that's a yes. It is? Really? Absolutely! Nature gave you plenty of muscles. Start digging yourself a new room. You're the best moms an annelid ever had! I just love it when they give us those big old slimy hugs. Me too. I want my new room to be special. My worm cave. Should I dig this way, or that way? What ya doing, Worm? That way. See ya later, Liddy! Hey! Hey, I feel singing. I better check it out. Down in the garden there lived a bee... Spider got stung on his spider knee. The bee felt bad and went to the hive. How much honey do you need to survive? One sip, two sips, three sips, four, five sips, six sips, spider wants more! Why are bees always the bad guys in these songs? Ha! So it was you bugs singing. Hey, Worm! Wanna jump ropes with us? They're 100% spider silk. And I won't sting. It's just a song. Sorry, no time to play. I'm digging myself a new room. A new room? We wanna help! Thanks, Fly, but digging isn't easy and it's a dirty job. Are you kidding me? Bom-ba-ba-bom! I'm Fly Girl! I can do anything! Zip through the air in the blink of an eye. Beat my mighty wings 200 times per second. Plus she's a pretty good jump-roper! High-sixes! Okay then! Everyone follow me down the hole. Wanna come with us, Bee? Thanks, but I think I'll stay here and rewrite that jump rope song. what rhymes with "bees are excellent pollinators and without us, this garden would be toast?" Uhm... Good luck with that! Okay. Slime you later! Let's go digging! Yeah! Wow! Oompf. Not much leg room down here, is there? I wouldn't know. Okay. So the trick to digging through dirt is just put your head down and go for it! That doesn't look too hard! Umm, Fly? Digging is all about getting dirty. If you keep washing your hands, this'll take all day. Sorry, Worm. I can't help it. Flies are actually very clean bugs! Okay... Spider, you wanna try digging? Sure. This is gonna be easy peasy. See? I can dig with these two legs and dump the dirt out with these two legs. And if I get an itch, I can still scratch my nose with these two legs! Whoops...oompf! Maybe 'scratching my nose' was pushing it. That's okay, it's my new room. I'm happy to do the digging. You bugs can just keep me company! I really dig digging. but this is more digging than a digger like me usually digs! That looks great. Sorry. Well, you did say you just wanted us to keep you company. How much further till you find your new room, Worm? This might be a good spot. What's that weird buzzing noise? Doesn't sound like bees. Doesn't sound like mosquitoes... It kinda sounds like my grandpa snoring when he's taking a nap. If this is gonna be my room, I wanna find out! Spider's right. They're sleeping, snoring, bugs. Wonder what kind they are? Well, they seem to have a body like me. And they have legs like me. And they also have... ..HUGE RED EYES! NOT like me! Yikes! Stand back, guys! Bom-ba-ba-bom! Fly Girl will protect you with my supersonic 45 miles-per-hour wing speed! SW-ISH! KAP! Hi... Say, what're you protecting everyone from? Err...well...you. Me?! I'm a cicada bug. I wouldn't hurt a fly. Or a worm. Or a spider. I just lay around here, minding my own business. So, I'm looking for a new room. Do you know of any good places? Well this place is TERRIFIC! I guess so. I mean, if you don't mind a bunch of snoring bugmates. Well... We've just been taking a little power nap for...uhm... maybe 13 years or so? 13 years?! Yup. Pretty soon it'll be time to dig myself out, fly up to the trees and sing my little heart out! We're sorry we bothered you, Cicada. Bother me? No, no bother at all. In fact, it's great to see ya! You look like a wonderful audience. How 'bout I sing a little something for you? Well... Ha, thought you'd never ask! Diary, there was no way my new room could be anywhere near the cicadas. They're even louder than my sister, Anna! My moms tell me, a worm should always remember three things. "One bugs trash is another bug's treasure." "Always look both ways before you crawl across the street." And, if you want your dreams to come true, sometimes you have to dig a little deeper. I wanted to find the best place for my new room. So, I knew I'd have to dig a little deeper for that too. I'm here all week, try the tree sap! - Wa...hoo... - Yeah. Yeah! You like me, you really like me! And now, for my next number Mr. Cicada... We really need to keep digging for my new room. Here's an oldie but goodie! We need to get him back to sleep, or we'll never get out of here. Hang on, this brighter-spider just had an idea... Here you go, Sir. A nice, soft, silky pillow to help you fall asleep. That's awfully sweet of you. But I'm not the least bit tired. Why don't I buzz a song for you? Ha! Yeah...high-fives! Middle sixes! Low eights! Tail bump! Wow, he snores even louder than he sings. Let's dig for my room as far away from here as possible! Digging in the dirt we heard this roar. Turned out to be a cicada snore! Wow! Look at that. A huge tunnel! With lots of room to spread my wings and FLY! This would be a great place for your room. Wheeeee! Nice high ceilings, too. Perfect for my webs. I bet this place was dug by some gopher. They're amazing tunnelers. If you make this your room, I'm definitely coming for a sleepover. This place is web-tastic. I see sunlight coming in. Fly Girl, off to check it out. Someone sure takes care of their lawn. - Fore! - What's that thing flying over here? It's faster than a moth, bigger than a dragonfly... and it's heading right for me! RUN! Run with what? I have no legs! Hop on! Hang on, everyone. What do we do? Where do we go? Close your eyes and push through. It's just dirt. Aghhh! How did we end up in water? Who knows? I'm just happy we got away from that gigantic white thing. Wa-hoo! Hang on tight. I'm using all eight legs. I wonder where this water goes? Who knows, Worm? Might lead us to the perfect spot for your new room. Like my moms always say, sometimes you have to dig a little deeper. Or float a little further. Fly Girl is captain of the ship. Aye, aye, Cap'n! Ahoy, Centipede! Three little bug friends, floating on a shoe. - A spider... - A worm... And a fly who flew! Digging in the dirt for Worm's new space. We wound up in this spectacular place. One bug, two bugs, three bugs, four. Five bugs, six bugs, let's explore some more! Attention! This is your captain speaking. Does anyone notice it's smelling kinda stinky in here? Kinda stinky? It's SUPER stinky! I can smell it with my legs. And I can smell it with my whole body. It smells like... rotting garbage! Rotting garbage?... Be still my five hearts! We found it. This is my perfect room. I wonder where we are? Excuse me! Mr. Roach, can you please tell us where we are? "Mr. Roach"? Pffff. We're proper water bugs, we are. Sorry. I'm just a fly. I don't get underground that often. Spider and Fly were helping me dig to find a nice space for my new room. How lovely to have such good friends to help you like that. Margaret and I are on holiday. We just love a nice cruise. So, where does this river lead to? Love, it's not a river. You're in an old water pipe. Where all the garbage ends up and gets taken downstream. So that's why it smells so delicious in here! Well, enjoy. We must be off. Good luck finding your new room, luvvies! - Ta, ta! - Bye! What's happening? Rapids ahead! All hands on deck! Hang on, everyone! Whoooooa. Wheee... - Yeah! - Wheee! My gosh, we've landed in a... Garbage bag! Wow, look at all this rotting, decomposing, icky trash. Also known as...paradise! Well, look who the tide washed in! Grampa Spider? Guess you kids found my favorite neighborhood 'hole in the wall'. Has this wonderful place always been here? Every day but Thursday - that's when they pick up the trash. Now, let's see what my fortune cookie says. I really believe these things. "You will spend the day alone." Wow! Never listen to a cookie. So, Grampa. Can ANYONE come here? Anyone who's hungry. Let's see. We've got some stinky stir-fried broccoli. Some decaying spaghetti and meatballs. And wo-ho! For dessert, mouldy apple-pie! My favorite. Worms love apples. Erm...are there any rules about burping and slurping your food in a public place? Nah, tons of flies come here. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet. Buzz-tacular! What a day. I've been digging through dirt for hours. Yeah? Digging for what? To find a nice quiet space for Worm's new room, so he doesn't have to share one with his little sister anymore. Yeah. She's always bugging him to tell her a story! Baby sisters. I got a million of 'em! But, you know what I just realized? What's that, kiddo? I know exactly where my new room should be. Come on bugs, let's go home! ...can we take some apple-pie to go? Pffft...of course! Doggy-bag spider style! - Thanks, Grampa. - Thank you. My very own, very quiet room. With all my stuff just the way I want it. Nice job on your room, honey. That's my digger! Wow, it's so roomy! Yep, it is. - What's this? - A present. I made it for you. It's me. I drew you a picture. So you'll always see my face, even when you're all alone in your new room. Thanks, Liddy. You're a pretty cute annelid. I don't know what that means, but thank you, Worm! I love you! I love you too, Liddy. Hey, do you wanna hear a bedtime story? You mean it? Yeah, I wanna tell you about the slime-tastic day I've had. We woke up a snoring cicada, who wouldn't stop singing. Escaped a giant ball by the tips of our tails. We had a wild ride in a shoe boat. And landed in a pile of stink-alicious garbage! Wow! That's the best story EVER. Okay you two wrigglers. Let's get ready for bed. Night, Worm. I'm really happy your new room is right next to mine. Me too. That's kinda what makes it perfect. Night, night. And so ends another dirt-filled day in my Bug Diary. What are you gonna write in your diary?
