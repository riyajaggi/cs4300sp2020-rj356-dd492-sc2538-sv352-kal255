 Fly Girl fearlessly carries the entire beehive to safety. Fly! Fly! Fly! Not now, bittybugs. I'm drawing Fly Girl's BIGGEST adventure ever. FLY! There's gonna be a picnic. Picnic? Why didn't you tell me sooner?! I gotta tell Worm and Spider! Spider, if the Bouncing Bugamathing is as webtastic as I think it's going to be, we could be on our way to becoming the greatest invention inventors in bug history. That's the plan! Tailbumps! Alright, Worm. Give it a try! Ouch... Ouch! - Is it great?! - Sort of... ouch. Worm! Spider! Bugs! THERE'S GOING TO BE A PICNIC! A human picnic? Really? I've always wanted to see a picnic. Me too. They're supposed to be just about the biggest thing that ever happens around here. The whole yard full of people - and food! Food everywhere! My mamas went to a picnic once. WORM A human brought lots and lots of ice cream. And shared it with everyone! Too bad we don't eat ice cream. Quick, somebody get some paper towels! Paper towels?! Yum! Grampa told me about a picnic he was at where he snagged a whole bowl of potato salad for the ants. - BOO! - Aghhh! A- ha! Mission accomplished. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Way to go, Grampa Spider. They made him an honorary ant for that one. Well, my dad told me about this one picnic... Where my Uncle Leonard drank so much iced tea... They literally had to roll him home! I can't wait! I can't wait! I can't wait! It's gonna be the most fantastic, spectacular, delicious thing you've ever seen! Of course! You're supposed to bounce... On top of the Bugamathing! You've done it, Fly! You figured out our invention! Whee! Whoaaa! Oof...agggh! Fly! I'm okay! I'm okay! Are you sure you're all right, Fly? Maybe you'd better sit down. I don't know how I could have done that. Accidents happen. Not to me they don't. Not when I'm flying. Fly, you were really more careening than actually flying. I'm an excellent flyer. We know, Fly. We know. But still maybe you ought to sit down for a minute. Not now. We've got a picnic to get ready for. Yikes! Hoo-boy. There sure are a lot of things for a bug to run into up here! Maybe I'd better just come back down to earth for a little. Fly, are you okay? Me? Heh heh. Yeah. I'm fine. - ... - Excuse us, folks. Comin' through. What's going on? The picnic, of course! Alright ants, double time! Gosh, with all these bugs around, we'll be lucky if we don't get trampled, let alone get close to all the goodies. Yeah, we might not even get a crumb, or a scrap of wet paper, as the case may be. If we want to get in on the fun, we need to up our game. - Uhm... - Hmmmm. I'm thinking we need something to get us up high, out from under feet. And I'm thinking we need something to help us reach the food. Another Invention! Something that'll bring us right into the middle of the excitement! Without getting us squished! Want to help us build something amazing, Fly? I have a feeling your fabulous flying faculties might be just the skill we need. Um, maybe later. Right now I think maybe I'll just go home. See ya. Walking?! I- I-I like to walk. You can really see the countryside this way. Who knew there were all these roots down here? Boy, this grass sure is green! Is Fly gonna join us at the picnic? Alright, ants! Take your positions! No, too much. That way. Perfect! Whoo! Picnics sure are a lot of work! Our house sure is high up when you're on foot. Fly, did you just climb all the way up here? Yeah. It's great exercise! I- I-I feel like I've been missing out by flying everywhere all the time. Really? Well, be that as it may, would you mind flying over to Miss Ladybug's and see if she wants to come with us to the picnic? Uhm...did you say...fly? ...gosh, Mom! I really need to finish working on 'Fly Girl No. 187' this afternoon. Well, never mind, I'll just buzz over there myself. This is ridiculous. I'm just gonna... Nope. No I'm not. Way too scary. Just imagine we're at the picnic. A little to the left! No, a little to the right. That's it, that's it. Bring it on down. Slightly to the right... Got it! And the Food Fisherman is complete! With this we'll be able to snag all the best goodies at the picnic. And now all we need is... Fly! Fly! - What is it - Come down here for a minute, will ya? We've got something to show you. But I JUST got up here. Hey bugs, what's going on? See? Isn't it brilliant. It's brilliant, all right. But what is it? It's the Food Fisherman! See, we just lower this from up above to snag the yummiest treats. - No muss, no fuss... - No getting squished. Wow, that is brilliant! Picnics around here are never gonna be the same, thanks to you bugs. Not that I've ever seen one, of course. But now I really can't wait! See, I told you Fly would recognize our genius for what it is... All we need for you to do is fly it into place. Ooohhh! Fly it? - Yep! - Here, we'll show you on the map. - Map? - Yup. As soon as the food starts coming out, you're gonna take the Food Fisherman and fly it right over that cake your aunt Rita was talking about. Then I'll spool out web-thread behind you. It'll take some fancy flying, but for an excellent flier like you, it oughta be no problem. Gee...I don't... I mean...I-I'm not sure I'm the right bug for this. You're the perfect bug for this. Nobody else can fly like you. I mean, there'll be tons of humans all over the place, and you'll have to dodge 'em, which may not be easy with you carrying all that weight. We wouldn't ask any other flying bug to take on a mission like this, but you're fearless Fly Girl, and nothing can scare you! Right? Hey bugs, what's up? We've just come up with the most bug-tastic invention for the picnic. It's called the Food Fisherman! Fly, you wanna show 'em how you're gonna fly this thing into place above the cake? Uhm...hey, I've got an idea! Why doesn't Cockroach do the flying for you? He's so much bigger than me, I bet he's a better flyer too. No can do, Fly. These wings... ..are just for gliding. Besides, for me all the fun starts at night, when all the humans go home. Nope, Fly, you're the bug for this job. No doubt about it! Uhm... I think I'm going to go home for a while. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. What? Are you walking again? Am I? Yeah, I guess I am. Do you think she's really okay? I sure hope so. Hi, Fly. Almost ready for the picnic, honey? I don't think I'm gonna go. What? Why?! You were so looking forward to it! ...I... I just don't feel like it. I uhm...earlier... I flew into something and crashed. Flew into something? That doesn't sound like you. - I know! - Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just that what if it happens again? What I keep crashing? Fly, that's not going to happen. You're a fly! You have super- strong wings, you can change direction instantly, and you have thousands of eyes to see anything that might be in your way. Now, why don't you go ahead and go to the picnic with your friends? I don't really feel like it, Mom. Fly, I know it's hard when you're afraid. But when you have your friends by your side, sometimes you find out you can do stuff you never thought you could. Maybe. But, I don't think I wanna do anything. Not now, at least. Well, it's up to you, Fly. Thanks, Mom. Sometimes Fly Girl doesn't feel like saving the world. Sometimes Fly Girl just wants to stay home where it's safe and she doesn't have to risk flying. Fly Girl thinks maybe she'll let somebody else be the hero today. Hello, Spider. Hello, Worm. Hi. We're here to get Fly for the picnic. Well, I don't know that she's feeling that great right now, but I'll go get her. Fly, your friends are here. Hey, Fly. Are you ready for the picnic? Guys, I uhm... I can't go. - What?! - You're not coming to the picnic? I mean, I want to of course, I want to. But, um, after that crash and all, well, I'm really not up to flying. That's terrible! I'd love to go, but I won't be any good if I can't fly. We're so sorry. Yeah, we're so sorry. Int's okay. Um, why don't you get going, so maybe you can find somebody else to help you with your fisherfood thing. Food Fisherman, actually. Yeah, well. Listen, I'll see you around. Have fun and all. I can't believe it. This is just awful. And it's all our fault. If we hadn't built that bouncing bugamathing, Fly would never have crashed into that tree. Our inventing days are over. You know, Spider, it doesn't matter if Fly can't fly. She can still have fun. She's been so looking forward to the picnic, and as her friends, it's our job to get her there. You're right. Maybe our inventing days aren't over. What do you mean? We're gonna turn the Food Fisherman into a Get-Fly-to-the-Picnic- without-Flying system. I like it! Come on, let's get to work! Did you hear that, ants?! This is not a drill! I repeat, this is not a drill! Now Fly can enjoy the picnic with us. There! Careful. I've just made this piece all slimy-slidey. Whoaaaaa! - It sure is slippery! - That's the point. We'll be able pull Fly along this as easy as pie. Wow, that's where all the food will be. Wait til Fly sees this! We'll be able to get her all over the picnic. - With no flying. - And no squishing. You know, Spider? Inventions are even more fun, when you make them to help somebody else. Alright, ants. Take your positions. See-ya! Ho, ho! Woo-hoo! - I'm gonna get you. - Yay! Wheeeeee! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Bzzz...bzzz...bzzz. - In a minute, kids. - Ye-hay! Fly, honey? We're leaving for the picnic. Are you sure you don't want to come? It'll be fun, whether you want to fly or not. I'm just gonna stay here, Mom. It'll be fine. Okay, darling. Whatever you want to do is fine. Woo-hoo! / Yay! / Alright! - Fly? - What is it? Fly, come on out here! I told you guys, I can't fly. And I don't wanna go to the picnic. We know. But we've got a special surprise for you. Something you don't have to fly for. What is it? Told you. It's a surprise. In fact... ...you're going to have to wear this. A blindfold? Yup! Big enough to cover your thousands of eyes. Well...okay, I guess. Where are we going? You'll see...in just a minute. - Tada! - The picnic! Guys, I told you. I can't fly. We know! That's why we made this for you. Go ahead. With this, you'll be able to enjoy the whole picnic, and you won't have to fly an inch! First stop, the drinks. Then over to the food, and the condiments. And finally into the tent for cake and ice cream! You did all this...for me? We knew how much you were counting on going to the picnic, and since you hurt yourself on our invention, we thought we'd make another invention to help you. It was the least we could do for our Best Bug Buddy! Fly, are you crying? No, I just got something in my thousand eyes. I can't begin to thank you for this. But...but...! I gotta tell you something! It's not that I can't fly, it's that...I'm afraid to fly! You're afraid? Yeah, I mean, what if I crash again? You won't. You're the best flier ever. You're Fly Girl! That's what you keep saying. But I crashed once. What's gonna stop me from crashing again? It's ok to be afraid. And with our new invention you don't have to fly. We can still enjoy the picnic together if you want to give it a try. Ready? Wheeeee! Buzztastic! Worm, this is great! It is, isn't it? And what a way to get right in the middle of the action! A- ha! Hey, sweetheart, you made it! How could I miss all this? I'm so glad you decided to come after all. Next, cake and ice cream! Slurp, slurp. Worm, Spider, this is so much fun! I can't ever thank you both enough! Fly, it's our pleasure. Well, there it is! The cake. Whoaa...aahhhh! Worm! Love your mom's cake! Worm! I don't...I don't...! Uhaaaa! Bom-ba-ba-bom! Nnnnnnnggggh! ...ooof! Fly, you flew! You saved me! I did! I did! I flew! And I didn't crash into anything. I guess when a friend's in trouble you can do pretty much anything, Yup! What happened at the trampoline was just an accident. I shouldn't doubt myself. Hey, Cody. Are you hungry? Humans! How're we gonna get out of here? Follow me! Now that's what I call dessert! You said it! ...wheeee! That was some fancy flying, Fly. I knew you could do it! I know too, now. So that's a picnic? That's a picnic! Yum! I guess everyone is afraid sometimes, even Fly Girl. I was so afraid of flying, that I almost missed my first picnic. But then, bom-ba-ba-bom! Worm and Spider to the rescue! Their invention flew me all around the picnic! And when friends are by your side, being afraid isn't such a big deal. So ends another amazing adventure. And so begins your next amazing adventure! What are YOU gonna draw in your Bug Diary?
