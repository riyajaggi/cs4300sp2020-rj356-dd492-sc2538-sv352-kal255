That's all it takes. - Well,I had my eye on them. - No. You didn'T. You can'T. No one can. Not all the time. And that is where they get their edge. Now you think about someone taking your kids,what once? Twice a day? That's all he thinks about. Every minute of every day. And the only time he's not thinking about it is when he's already got 'em. 'Cause then he's thinking of all the horrible things he's gonna do to them. Dennis! Sorry. Just,uh... ever since the accident... I'm so scared of losing you. Den-- as long as you're here with us,we're fine. Hello? Courtney? - Who's this? - Me,punkin. It's your daddy. - Daddy? - God... yeah baby. It's me. - I love you so much. - Here,honey. I got it. - Hello? - Kathy. It's dennis. You gotta listen to me. The man in your house is not me. - You gotta pack the kids and get out. - What's going on? It's that man again. - Who is this? - Brodigan,you son of a bitch! You need to stop calling this number,or I'm gonna contact the police. Brodigan! Brodigan! What a loon. Don't worry. I'll have the number changed. It's all good. What the hell is your problem? You're wondering why there's no other prisoners in here? 'Cause we want you all for ourselves. One of the people that you killed was named cherie davenport. Remember her? Pretty little blond. She was my fiance. - You don't understand. - You shut up! You shut up! She was out having dinner with her parents! I couldn't make it because I had to work late! And then we got the call. And I was the first one on the scene! And there was so much blood! It wasn't me. You son of a-- let go.Let go! - I'm not afraid of you. - Yes,you are. Don't try calling the house again. I changed the number. This isn't gonna work. What do you want me to do about it? You want me to turn myself in? Oh,hey officer,this isn't richard brodigan. I am. I'm just trapped in the wrong guy's body. You think they're gonna buy that? You think that's gonna work? Come here. Come here. You can run. I got stocks,bonds. Money in the bank. You can cash everything out. Go anywhere in the world. Well,who's gonna take care of kathy and the kids? They can take care of themselves. No,dennis. They can'T. They need me. They're my responsibility. I'm not gonna abandon them the way my father abandoned me. Besides,who's gonna help sean with his batting? Someone's gotta make that kid an all star. And kathy. To be honest,I've never been with a woman like that before. She seems so shy. But you get a couple of drinks in her... - don't even--don't you- - sorry. It's uncalled for. Forgive me. I'll tell you what. Gotta give it to you. I don't know how you do that job,man. That-- that boss of yours. - Gerald. - Gerald. Yeah. I mean,he's always on me. And I go over and over the audit reports. And it's never,ever good enough. - You're right. - Right. You're totally right. Gerald can be a real turd sometimes. The trick is to use his template. And it's all boilerplate. You get sally to fill out the blanks from the monthlies. - She can do that? - Yeah. It's part of her job. See? This is what I'm talking about. We can help each other. Yeah. Sure we can. I gotta go. It's courtney's school play tomorrow. She's a bumblebee. You--you should see the costume. She's such a cute kid. So affectionate. Ah--listen to me. I'm sorry. I'm just going on. Ah,tell you what. I'll bring you some video. - Video? - Yeah. Of the play. Gonna be late. Can't keep the old ball and chain waiting. Here's the situation,brodigan. The F.B.I.'S all over my assbecause they want yours. Just so happens the crimes you committed were inmy jurisdiction. So I can keep themat bay for a while. But... not forever. But I didn't do-- just let me finish. I need to wrap this investigation up quickly. People in my county deserve closure. That means a proper burial of their kin. For once in your life,do the right thing. Confess your crimes. Tell mewhere the bodies are. In return,I'll personally go to the D.A.And do my bestto get you life. The alternative is not nearly as attractive. - I'm telling you,I'm not the one who did it! - Don't tell meyou're innocent. It insultsmy intelligence. My offer is only good until end of day tomorrow. I'll go out for a while. ********** No son of mine is gonna play ball with a glovelike that. We just got him thatlast christmas. This mitt's ok,dad. Really. No. No. It's garbage.
