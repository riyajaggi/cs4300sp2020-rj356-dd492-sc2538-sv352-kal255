Burning suspects? 15 pages of this crap, and yet you never once used your firearm in the line of duty. Why not? Self-control. Aren't you apologetic at all, Harry? Not really. And why is that? Sometimes you gotta do a wrong to make things right. I'm not so sure Rory Bemmel... would agree with that sentiment. What's it gonna be, counselor? You gonna lock me up and swallow the key? What? You saved a senator's child, Harry. That's a pretty big bargaining chip. 100 hours. Community service. But... say good-bye to your badge... and your pension. Son of a bitch. Yo, Harry? FIFTEEN YEARS LATER You get those caffeine pills I left you? You know I got you the cherry chewable ones. For your old teeth. You young me one more time, - I'll make sure you regret it. - You're gonna have to catch me first. The label say take 2. You know that means take 10. We got some here! Lovebirds comin' your way, Harry. We saw action! You think they're gonna get right to the eel in the cave game or what? No foreplay? Or just straight at it? Give me a name, babe. Give me a name. I want to show you something. I want to show you something. Oh, Richard! I got a name. Oh, Janet! - Get over here, get over here. - Oh, I'm here, baby. Oh, my wife never does that. - I love that. - What's wrong with her? Do it again. Right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You like that? You like that? - I love that. That is your husband's voice, right? Yeah. That's Richard. This will help with the divorce proceedings. How much do I owe you, Mr. Bender? 2,000 dollars. And 4,000 to destroy the other tape. What other tape? - Douglas! - Oh, baby. Richard know you're screwing his bro? You like it like that, huh? So, the ladies await. Sure you don't want to go? - No. I got paperwork to catch up on. - All right. It's your call. James? What is that about? Yeah. Just picked this baby up the other day. Sweet, right? I thought I told you, no guns on the job. Come on, Harry, it's for protection. There are a lot of sickos. It's for protection. I never want to see that gun again. You understand? I'm not kidding. All right. Fine. You got it. "Officer." I'll catch you in the A.M. Bender investigations? Thanks, Tom. Mr. Bender? I'm Meredith King. Of course. Have a seat. I've got a very serious problem. I hope I can be of help. My husband is... is having an affair. Maybe more than one. I'm not sure. He brings them... back to our home when I'm gone. I often work nights. I'm a social worker for the city. I'm sorry. I want you to give me the evidence, Mr. Bender. The evidence I need to make him pay. That's my job, Mrs. King. Making them pay. Give me your address. I'll have a van out front to eyeball the place. A van? No, no. Jack would notice a van outside the house. He already thinks that I know. - That's pretty much how we do things. - There's a place, a house across the street. It's vacant. That's perfect, right? That'll work. Thank you. Thank you for helping me. Great. Great. Close the door, man. Harry, I've seen some hellholes in my day. This looks like the helliest and the holiest. Oh, God. I never thought I'd be looking forward to that nasty old van. Stop the chatter, man. It's not great, but set up the remote camera here on a three-hour loop. I'm gonna go find a better angle upstairs. You got it. You know what? Now, that I look at it, we might be able to fix this place up. Make it into something nice, you know? - Yo, Harry! I'm finished down here! - Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. Got a good angle up here! Take the van, go down the road, and find a good surveillance spot. Be discreet! "Discreet"'s my middle name. I hope so, pal. All right, so, it's 10:00, Harry. Still nobody home. Guess he's banging her at the office tonight. Yo, Harry. I was wonderin'. You, uh, you ever get, you know, hot, excited listening in on all these little trysts? James, shut up. So, wifey's keeping you happy then, huh? What was that? I said, "so, wifey's keeping you happy then, huh?" No, no. I'm picKing something up here. Where? From the house? Before he could even open his mouth, this guy starts hitting him. I got a light on. Second floor. I don't see it. Second floor. Far side. Someone is in her house. How? I didn't clock any cars coming by Aren't you getting this? I got nothing but an empty house. Before he left, he kicked him. Once in the head, and then in the ear. This guy's a monster. Must have been an auto timer, radio frequencies, something. Just keep your eye on the front door this time. All right? Can you do that? Harry. I swear to you. Nobody went into that house. James, someone's in here. Where? Where you are? That old house? Yo, Harry, you find anyone? Let's go! Let's go, go! - What the hell are you doing here? - Nothing. - Not good enough. What are you doing? - Piss off, old man. - Answer me. - It was a dare. It was just a dare! - A dare? - To stay the night. Don't tell my mom, all right? Please? Why would someone dare you to stay here? 'Cause of what happened. To those kids. What kids? What are you talKing about? It killed them, man! What killed them? The house. This house. Get the hell off of me! Big, bad Harry wigged out by a couple tweens!

All over my thighs. Listen. Just give me a badge number, a name. I can take down a formal complaint. His name wasSeigel! I came as soon as you called. Mrs. King, I'm not going to be able to... finish the investigation. That's yours. Minus one night, of course. I don't... I don't want my money. See, I want proof that my husband is having an affair. He never showed last night. OK. Well, sometimes he sleeps at the office. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to try again tonight. What is it? There's something else. Tell me, Harry. What's wrong? I'm a good listener. It's what I do. If you knew some of the stories that people have told me. Broken lives, lost souls. But I can promise you this... no one feels worse after telling them. Come on. I've done some bad things. Lots... of bad things. We've all got skeletons. Well, mine are starting to come back. What do you mean? That house I'm staking out in... It's making me see things. It's just a old house, Harry. It's... bricks and wood. It couldn't possibly... Harry... Listen... my brother... my brother, he made some big mistakes. Big mistakes. But every night my father would come into his room and say, "tomorrow brings another day." Do you understand that, Harry? We've all done... bad things, but tomorrow... you can always try to make up for them. But today... Please, I'm begging you. Please go back there, Harry. Please. Help me. And maybe... somehow... I can help you. You're gonna die, man. I had a date tonight, Harry. I thought the gig was over. Changed my mind. - What's this? - That's a video loop from last night. Check it out.
