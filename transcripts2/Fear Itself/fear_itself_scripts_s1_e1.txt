 We stay off the main roads. The last thing we want to do is attract attention, end up with some cop looking through our stuff. Yeah, I get that. What was that? What was that? Come on. Damn it. You wait here with Navarro. We're screwed. You think? Hey, guys, Navarro's coughing up a lot of blood. Let's get the gear out of the truck. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync:?????? / xxixixx [ Fear Itself ] Season01 Episode01 [ The Sacrifice ]

 So, what are we gonna do? About what? Navarro...I mean, what happens if he dies? He's not gonna die. I never thought anyone was gonna get hurt. Yeah,well,when you playin the big leagues, you gotta take some chances. All right, fine. Why couldn't we have just taken our chances, stuck to the highways, or rented a puddle jumperand flown? The real question is... why did I even bother letting you come in the first place? You're lucky to even be here. Well, if this is luck, I'd hate to see misfortune. We're going in there? Hello! Hello! Could you wait up a second? Hello? Is anybody here? Hello! Come on. You're all right. This place is nice and creepy. Are you just here to annoy me? No, I'm here 'cause I'm your brother and 'cause you love me half right. And 'cause I made a deal. So... there's a big difference between making a deal and closing it. The minute we get home, you're not my problem anymore. Blood's not enough. I'm done fixing your problems. - You wait here with Navarro - Navarro. Yup, I got it. Hello! Anybody? Hello! - I told her to stop touching him, but she wouldn't listen. - Ok, ok. Get away from him. I said step away. - He's dying. - Come on, love. Be a good girl, back away from him. Stay back. Do us all a favorand drop it. Freeze! Lemon, relax. My sister Virginia. Sister? Very nice. I'm Point. This is Diego and Lemon. This is Navarro. We gotta get him some help. We had some trouble on the road. We drove over something that tore the bottom out of our truck. - Gutted like a trowel. - If we could just use your phone? No phone. How about a car? We do not care much for the bonds of modern society. Well, what are you saying? This is one of those hippy, grow your own vegetables, smoke a lot of weed, free love kind of places? Nothing is free. Your friend is in no shape to travel. You're welcome to spend the night. Thanks. We appreciate it. Get the blankets. Prepare the guest rooms. I, um, could use a little help in the barn. I'm all over that. The reverend was injured. Lay your friend here. We were, uh, riding the river when the bar ran into a low-hanging branch, and it just... it broke right through his chest. What were you doing on the river this time of year? Well, just, uh, lookin' for thrills. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Our people have lived here a long time. We know how to take care of ourselves. Well, the graveyard looks pretty full for people who know how to take care of themselves. Life here is not easy. Put your hands here. Where are you from? California. I've read books about California. They say the sun always shines there. Most of the time. I would like to see the ocean one day. Must be impressive. You mean, you've never seen the ocean? I've never been outside these walls. Ok, come on. You must have been to a movie or to a neighbor's house or, I mean, there must have been somewhere.. you should go back inside and get some food. No, we're not gonna just leave Navarro here while we go inside and fill our stomachs. You're making me nervous hovering over me while I work. Besides, the stew is best eaten hot. Ok. - Come get us if you need anything. - I will. This way. Here. - Your boyfriend's a lucky guy. - No boyfriend. Seriously? I, um, ahem... I don't get out much. Well, this place is kind of remote. It gets lonely at night. It's a good thingwe came along, then, huh? Very good thing. I like your style. Get ready for the ride of your life. Help me. Virginia, please. Come on, help me. What are you doing? No... what are you doing? You bitch! Smells good. Thanks. My name's Lemon... which is short for Lemuel, which sucks, but it was my grandfather's name, my father's name. So, I would be technically Lemuel III, so it's just a lot easier to say... - Lemon. - It's...it's Lemon. - Thanks. - Thanks. This is really good. What is the meat? Is it beef or lamb or... is it rabbit? You don't think this is squirrel, do you? Tara doesn't speak. You can go now. I'll finish up here. Oh, could you tell her that I liked the stew? Her hearing is fine. How is Navarro doing? He has lost much blood, but I believe he will be fine. So, I was wondering, how do you guys survive out here without any electricity? I don't know what I'd do without my flat screen and my Madden 08. This is the way we have always lived. But you don't have any dial-up or anything? - Or are you Amish? - Lemon... something like that. - I'm gonna take some of this stew out to Navarro. - Not now. He's sleeping. - He's sleeping? - Yes. The herbs made him drowsy. The best medicine is for him to rest. He can eat later. You're right. I'm just gonna take this out to him so it'll be there when he wakes up. Lemon, go find Diego. - Why can't we just. - Lemon, do what I tell you. Navarro? Navarro, you awake? Hello? Hello! - What is that? - Morte. I'm gonna get youout of here. No, no. No, no, no, no!  No! Leave me! Hello! Point! Anybody out there! I mean, somebody help me! Hello! Down here! Get me out of here! Help me! Somebody help me! Chelsea! What the hell did you do to him? Killing me will not save you. I'm sorry. It is too late. What? For what? What are you talking about? What the hell is out there? Something in that infirmary killed Navarro and the reverend. The reverend is dead? Wh...what's out there? I gotta find my brother. Point, don't go back out there! Diego! Diego! Where the hell are you? Hello? I came to get more kerosene for the lanterns. It promises to be a very cold night. Virginia, have you... have you seen Diego... anywhere? No? Virginia, that's a nice name. Funny story, my name's not actually Lemon. It's Lemuel. It was my grandfather's name and my father's name. So I would be Lemuel the third, but that... I think Lemon is sexy. You mean like, uh... the name, or me? Both. Well, what are we gonna do about that? I have an idea. I think... I think you're goingto like it. Well, I'm sure whatever it is, I'm all for it. Help! Help! Help! I am so sorry, tata. So sorry. Please take him into your kingdom. Allow him to live in your presence, and bask in the warmth of your light. Receive his spirit. Cleanse his body, and his soul. And deliver him from evil. Lemon! What the hell? Lemon... Lemon! Damn it! Damn it! Hello? Hello! Somebody there, hello? Hello, can you hear me? Oh, thank god! I swear the... No! No! No! Help! Point! Help! Tara! Ta...Tara, thank god! Come here. Come here, it's ok. Come...come here, just come over here and help me down. Look, I...I have no idea how I got here, but I...I...I... the last thing I remember was Virginia, and... Tara, just please come... come help me down, ok? You know, I really, I liked your stew. It was...it was really nice of you to, uh, to feed us and everything. Just, Tara, please, I can't feel my feet, so if you could come over here and help me down... there you go. That's it, ok. The joke's over. Just...just cut the rope, ok? What are you doing? Tara, what...what? Tara, please...please! Please, just let me go! Please! What...what was that? No, no, no, please! Please, Tara, no! No, please, you gotta help me! Please, Tara, no! Lemon! Lemon! Lemon! Lemon! Lemon? Lemon, you with me? I'm comin', Lemon. Lemon! Hold on, man. I got you. I got you, Lemon, I got you. I got you. I got you, hold on. Hold on, Lemon. You're gonna be ok, man. You're gonna be ok. You hear me? You're gonna be ok. Stay with me. Come on, stay with me. I got you, I got you. I got you, all right? Here you go. Come on. I got you. I got you, I got you. Ok, look at me. Look at me. Don't you go to sleep, you hear me? Don't you go to sleep on me! You're gonna be ok. All right? You'll be ok. Come on! Don't you go to sleep! Get away from him! What happened? What have you done? Bullets are useless against it. Nine millimeter hollow points, 15 rounds per second, I'll cut that thing to ribbons. See him try to fight me without a damn head! I said stay away from him! No more games. It's time for answers. What is that thing? Diego's missing, my brother is dying. The preacher and your sister are already dead! Tara! What happened to her? I saw the...the... license plates in the yard, I saw that spike in the road! What did you do to our little sister? You bring people here and you what? You feed them to that thing? Tara is dead. She's dead, all right. You must listen. Your brother was bitten. You have no choice but to kill him before he turns... kill my brother? It is too late. He will become like the creature unless he dies by fire. A stake through the heart, or... we chop off his head. What...what are you saying? You're saying that thing is...is a vampire? You're saying my brother is a vampire? Not yet. Ok, come on, come on. Lean up, lean up, breathe. Look at me. Lemon, Lemon. Look at me. Come on, sit up, sit up. When our people came here from Romania, the creature hid among them. They built this fort away from others to keep it in. - As long as we supply it with food - You mean humans. Stays here with us. Do you think we want this burden? We have dedicated our lives to saving a world we've never even seen. We know what we do is wrong, but what choice do we have? Kill the son of a bitch. Over the years, many have tried, none have succeeded. Many? We're the only ones who remain. What...what...what about that preacher? He was our father. A vampire was feeding off of him until... until fresh blood arrived. You sold outyour own father? He made the sacrifice for us. I bet. Point, I can't.... I can't see. Point... I am sorry for your brother, but there is no other way. Point... it's ok... Lemon, Lemon, Lemon, look at me. - You stay with me, you hear me? - Point... thanks for letting me come, ok? Lemon, Lemon, come on, Lemon. Come on, look at me. Look at me, Lemon. Just breathe, ok? Come on. Come on, Lemon. Lemon, Lemon. Lemon, Lemon, come on! Come on, don't you die on me, don't you die on me! Point, there's no time to waste. Back off! You back off! Lemon! Lemon, don't! You know what you must do. I can't. It's him! He smells the blood. Where is he? We gotta get out of here. Take me to the barn. I won't let you. - Help me! - Come on, we gotta go. Come on! Let's go, let's go, come on! Go, go, go! Oh, damn it. What is that? What are you doing? What we must. Is it a trap? No! - I love you! - I love you! Chelsea, Chelsea, we need to go. Point! We're gonna burn it. Punch it in, use the ax. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync:?????? / xxixixx [ Fear Itself ] Season01 Episode01  [ The Sacrifice ]
