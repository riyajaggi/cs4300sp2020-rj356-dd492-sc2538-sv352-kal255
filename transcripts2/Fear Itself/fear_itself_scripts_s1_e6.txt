Oh, come on.It's new year'S. Don't worry about it. Just be happy. All right, come on. Excuse us. We have more news on that blaze at compton chemical which broke out just past 10 P.M. There's no indication what started the fire, but we have learned that some 3 dozen workers are injured and at least 10 people have been killed. A spokesman for the fire department tells me they hope to have the fire contained in the next few hours. In the meantime, they are asking people to avoid the east side of town... I'm sorry I haven't really been there for you. It's ok. I'm fine, really. I'm ok. Remember when you used to cry whenever my mother would pick me up from your place? Yeah. I was 4 years old. Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying. We've been friends for a long time. And...I know we've drifted apart. But I love you. You're like a sister to me. And I promise I'm gonna try and-- chrissy... you are the only real friend left in my life. Don't say that. No, it's true. I mean, look around. Do you really think I fit in with that crowd in there? Who cares if you don't fit in? I've never fit in anywhere. Those girls in there are wearing masks. They don't even know who they are. You do. You're unique.You're special. But guys are attracted to women like that-- I don't know, women who don't really have... any real feelings that might complicate a relationship and that somehow can always smile, regardless of what is tearing them up inside. What are you saying? I don't know. I'm just saying that you're the only person that really likes me for me. And I cannot even tell you how much I love you for that. I'm sure I'm not the only person here that likes you. I'm gonna go find James. The exposure to the ash is hazardous and... Testing. James... Helen, it's-- what is going on? Helen, is that you? What? James, I can't hear you. I can't make outwhat you're saying. Chrissy told me to come. I'm coming to visit. Helen, if you can hear me, don't go any where near them. James, what? You have to stay Inside your apartment. James, I can't hear you. Helen-- what? I can't understand what you're saying. James, I said I'm coming over. Listen--Helen-- there's something wrongwith the phone. God, I love you. Hey.HeY. I tried calling you. I thought you said you were gonna call before. Yeah. Uh, my phone died. Sorry. I'm sorry. My, uh, I'm sorry!My cell phone sucks. No. I suck, ok? I got busy, and then--and then I was late, and that's why I didn't call you. But look, I promiseI'm not avoiding you. Ok? Huh? You ok? What? Are you ok? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. You don't look ok. Uhh. I'm fine. All right. Let's get that drink. Come on. can we, uh... I wanna do, it, too... so, I'm sorry. I just really don't like dancing. Oh, no. It's fine. Uh, Eddie was telling me-- really? What didhe have to say? He was just talkingabout relationships. What would he know about relationships? Has he ever been in one? Well, he wasn't talking about himself. He was talking about, you know, me and you. really? Yeah.

Action news has justlearned from police that despite earlier reports from the fireat compton chemical, there is no evidence of fatalities. Repeat--no one,it seems, has died.
