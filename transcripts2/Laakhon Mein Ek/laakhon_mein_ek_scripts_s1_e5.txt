We're having a meal together after such a long time. We've missed you so much. And yes Hansal your friend. His mother had come home. She was telling me how tensed she is because of him. I told her, it is Hansal who was spoiling my son. She knows everything. Not just her, all of Raipur knows that our son Aakash has topped at Genius Infinity. He is a Topper! Why aren't you eating? The food is really good. Try it at least! Ma, I ate at the hostel. Aakash! By the way, Visakhapatnam is a wonderful place. Isn't it? You know I have stepped out of Raipur after 10 years. Oh! Don't you worry about that, we will see the world now. Will you show me the world? Not me, Aakash will. - Really? - Yes. Remember where Sharmaji went last year? Lords! Lords, to watch the match. And now our son will take us. What say Aakash? I want to go to Singapore. By the way Aakash, it's been so long since I heard you mimic Amit sir's dialogue. What was it? I don't feel like, Ma. Just once, please. This is not done. You've never performed for your father. I want to hear it too. And you shouldn't break your mother's heart. Right, so let us hear it. Rishte mein toh... Rishte mein toh hum... Rishte mein toh hum tumhare... Rishte mein toh hum tumhare baap lagte hain... Rishte mein toh hum tumhare baap lagte hain... Rishte mein toh hum tumhare baap lagte hain. Rishte mein What happened Aakash? What is it son? You're crying? You won't tell your mother what is wrong? Ma IIT is very difficult. Look son. You will have to work hard. You are doing so well here. You have been promoted from section D and not to section B or C, but to section A. This is a huge deal! And once you pass out of IIT and come back to Raipur. It won't just be your family but the whole of Raipur will welcome you back. That is why study well now. Understood? After that, what is Raipur, Switzerland or Lords? Are you getting it? Our son will take us everywhere! I'm feeling terrible! That I have wasted this opportunity you gave me. Ma. I don't know if my going away is right. But it is best for everyone. Papa. Please forgive me. I failed to fulfil your dreams. Sorry Chudail. Sorry Bakri. All boys remain inside rooms. I repeat. All boys remain inside rooms. All boys remain inside rooms. I repeat. All boys remain inside rooms. I repeat. All boys remain inside rooms. Open the door! Open!
