 Aakash! You topped section D again? Thanks man. Hard work pays off. You're an idiot. Why? Do you really think I can't top the exams? Nope. I intentionally answer half the questions wrong. That's because you have a bad memory, idiot. Bro, cheating is an art. Overdo it and you're fucked. Besides, every one's noticing you asshole. And people are getting curious. So what? What if someone gets suspicious? We'll all be in shit. Nothing will happen. Watch it. Are you scared of Moorthy? Are you crazy? Then why are you so worried? I am not scared of Moorthy I am scared of my father. If Moorthy tells my father, he will beat the shit out of me and I'll have to go back home. Who would want to leave this life and go home. Mishraji! Open the door Mishraji. Come in, quickly. What Mishraji? Such high security! You should work in a bank. I used to, but those bastards fired me. What do you want? Hurry up. Here. - Here, take the chips. - Hold this packet. Cigarette. Here are the cigarettes. And here are the chocolates. The medicine wasn't available. What do you mean not available? How will the students keep their eyes open at night? How will they study? Moorthy is very strict these days. What can I do? Just manage with whatever you're getting. Oh! Come on Mishraji. You're scared of Moorthy too? What did you say? - What did you say? - Mishraji... Mishraji. Calm down. Relax. Please Mishraji. Here sit down. Aakash, don't you have any respect? Say sorry, Aakash. Aakash! Say sorry to Mishraji. I was just joking. Joking? Have you seen his attitude? Let it go Mishraji. He's a friend. Anyway, how's everything else? Moorthy is taking everyone's case these days. All because the CBSE Inspector is visiting. And I'm getting fucked. For your cultural programme. You guys will be dancing, singing, eating, drinking. And you'll pass out on your beds like assholes. What do I get? Should I just sit and wank? I miss my girlfriend, man. - Mishraji, Mishraji. - Do something for me too. Here. Keep this extra 400 rupees, you'll need it. - Let's go. - Hey! 2700 rupees are still due. Come on Mishraji. Where am I running off to. I'm right here. Let's settle this next time. All boys report to the mess now. This Bala is a fucking asshole. He's made my life a living hell. Mishra! Come to office now. As you all know, CBSE inspection is going on. So I expect you all to be on your best behavior. Nothing goes unnoticed in Genius Infinity. Nothing! Aakash Gupta. Fuck! Aakash Gupta, come here. Aakash Gupta, a few months ago I had to punish you. Your grades were the lowest in the institute. Then all of a sudden your grades started soaring. How is that possible? I don't know sir. Bathroom. Bala told me everything. Sorry sir. Will not do again. No need to say sorry. It is not a crime to study late at night. You have studied every night and turned your fate around. You are an inspiration to all the other students. For your exceptional achievement, I have for you an exceptional reward. Aakash Gupta, Section A! Aakash, how are you? Hello Ma! Give the phone to papa. Is everything okay? Okay, hold on for a minute. It's for you. Hmm. Who is it? It's Aakash. He wants to speak to you. - Hello. - Hi papa, how's it going? Sorry? I mean how's the shop doing? Any tension? What is it? Why are you so excited? They've transferred me to section A. What do you mean? I mean I was in section D, right? Yeah, so? So, I got promoted to section A. Okay. And that's not it. I scored 80% in the exams. No one has ever been promoted from section D to A in the last five years. Is everything okay? Yes. Congratulations. Thanks Dad. This is good. But don't get overconfident now. Concentrate and study hard. You don't want to go back in section D, right? That won't happen, don't worry. Please tell Ma as well. And come and meet me soon. We haven't met in a long time. I have to go now! Bye. What did he say? Everything's fine. Your son has been promoted. Bro! You're a champion bro! Well done. Hey, congrats man. You're treating us, right? Why? Your dad's getting married? Fuck off. Come on Chudail. Why are you shifting to section A? You'll get bored to death there. As if I was entertained here. No, there are fewer kids there. It won't be as much fun. I'm not going there to have fun, Chudail. You'll have to eat breakfast earlier. That's good, isn't it Bakri? No. You'll get indigestion. Bye Dilip. Listen. The question paper is the same and so is the answer sheet. I have spoken to Mishra. He is overcharging but I'll handle him. Look Chudail, I am not going to section A to cheat. The teachers are better there and I plan to go straight to IIT. Papa has spent a lot on my education. Don't get emotional now. Hey, this is Chandu's room. Let's leave, let's leave. Come on. Chudail! Thanks. Listen... stay away from Chandu. He is a... Thanks man. Chudail knows everything. Let's go. Hey Aakash Gupta. Very good. Congrats. Krishna would be very happy you are taking his place. Thank you! Welcome. Come. This is your bed, okay? Your room is amazing, Arun. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! He is so irritating, man. Taken! Thanks, Arun! Who did you complain to this time? Bala or Moorthy? Wow! Look Chandu, I really don't know what your problem is, but I think we should end this now. In fact let's help each other. We're on the same level now. Same? Same? Okay. Just answer one question. What is non-Newtonian fluid? Come on. Answer. What is non-Newtonian fluid? Come on. Answer. What is non-Newtonian fluid? Who doesn't know what a non-Newtonian fluid is? Just because you have read 40 more books, doesn't mean you are a hero now. Answer my question first. Fucker, answer my question first. Have you ever seen a girl? According to his logic a boy minus a dick is a girl. Shut up! Do you guys know Chandu is a robot? If you look into his pants, you'll find AAA batteries in his underwear. Shut up! Okay, let's forget about girls. Have you ever watched a film? Tell me whose line is this? Rishte mein toh hum tumhaare baap lagte hain. Let's give him a few options: A. Amitabh Bachchan. B. Sachin Tendulkar. C. Chiranjeevi. D. Rekha. What happened? Poor Chandu has to think now? Do you need help? Okay then. Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Before asking me this, you should have known that Newton never had sex in his entire life. Is it true? Today we learnt that there are two types of waves, where the particles oscillate in the same direction as the wave propagation, it's called the...? Longitudinal Waves. Great. And where the particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation, then it's called a...? Transverse Wave! Very good. Any doubts? No sir. Sir. Yes Aakash. Sir you just said that when wave travels, water particles move up and down. And not ahead. That's right. That's incorrect. Sorry? Sir, I've tried it. If you put a paper boat on water, it doesn't move up and down. It moves ahead. That's not even... What are you saying? Look sir. This is water and this is the paper boat. If you push the boat like this, it won't move like this. It will go like this. Silence. Sir, it's true. Aakash, you are very much behind syllabus. You have a lot of catching up to do. Okay? Sit down. Sir. Sir. Sir, yesterday I was finally able to solve question no. 33 sir. That's great. Come explain to the entire class. Yes sir. Sir, I'll erase this? Yes please. Aakash Gupta! So boys, the solution we have, Three x plus iy minus six minus three I divided by two x F by delta S as limit delta S tends to zero. Understood Aakash? Yes yes, of course sir. So if we draw a free body diagram of the entire pulley system, there are two masses. This is m1... Shut up, man. Two x plus iy minus eight minus six i. Okay, everybody? Yes sir. - Understood, everybody? - Yes sir. Aakash? Yes sir. Okay, thank you boys. You all deserve this break. Please go. Thank you so much sir. Hey, you got question 26? Question 26. Hmm. If one mass accelerates at A, then other one accelerates at 2A. - Correct? - Correct! Then draw a free body diagram and solve it, no? Thanks genius. I did that only, okay? But the answer is different. I got G/7 but it shows minus G/7. Then you must have made some silly mistake. Anyway you are a mad silly fool. Chandru! Don't you dare call me fool, okay? I am warning you. I am topper of the institute, I will call you fool. Listen. You are just a bloody virus. - You are jealous of me. - Don't mess with me, Chandru. - I came first. - Shut your mouth! - Shut your mouth! - You shut your mouth. Aakash Gupta! Collect a parcel from Bala sir's office. Hello, sir. - Good evening, sir. - Hello. Good evening. Sir, ladoos? Homemade. No, no thanks. I have diabetes. - Sir. - Yes? Sorry for not understanding in class today. No problem. Don't worry. Study and cover up the pending syllabus. You'll be fine. Yes, I'll work hard sir. Spark is there sir, fire will come. Good boy. Okay. What is the answer to question no. 26? 26? Question 26's answer is misprint. It's wrong. I'll explain in class tomorrow, okay? - Don't worry. - Thank you sir. - Thank you so much. - Okay. Good night, sir. Bye. Thank you, sir. Guys, the answer to Question No. 26 is wrong. Ladoos? Yeah. We know question 26 is wrong. We are doing Question 34 now. Hey Aakash Gupta. Answer to Question 26 isn't wrong. It's Chiranjeevi. Bakri. It's called swag not saag. Aakash, hi. Chudail, hi. Hey Bakri, what's up? How's it going in section A? Everything's good man. Great people. Nice food. Better teachers. And how are things with Chandu? He's a damn nice guy. We've become good friends. So is Dilip also joining you guys on the terrace these days? Yeah, Dilip is cool. Yo! Dilip, imitate Bala. Hey, what is happening? Finished! It's good. Good. But your voice is coming from the throat, it should come from the stomach. What is happening? Finished! It'll be better from your stomach. Actually, Dilip is not feeling well. That's why he is not doing it right. Oh, I see. Chudail, Ma has sent some ladoos. No way! Ladoos? Give. Sir, Sir, Sir. He's taking three instead of one sir. Chandu the fucker! Alright then, I'll head now. - Have to study. - Sure. Of course. Or else you'll fail in tomorrow's exam and will have to return to section D. No bro, no more section D for me. Best of luck with the honesty. Why are you not eating? Are you ready for the exam? I haven't studied at all, man. You don't want dhokla? Okay give. Thank you. It's not just academics. It's overall development of character. Come I'll show you. Yeah. Sir... Toilet. Remember B... C... C. Bitch Cock Cock. - That's two cocks, right? - Yes. Let's go. I just need to use the washroom. That was when one of our section D boys got into section A. Brilliant student. Genius Infinity will recognise everyone's potential. Everyone's. Proudest moment of my life. By the way, Mr. Ramesh I just want to know. How long after this inspection, we'll get our license? I am asking because you know we have lot of investments to make, lot of planning. I want to make this place bigger than Kota, you know? Yeah, that is why I want to... One of your students ran away? Krishna? No! He didn't run away. He fell ill, he was in the hospital, poor chap. Father didn't have money for hospital bills, you know? I paid for everything. I said health is more important. He can give the exam next year. - No stress. - True. But life is so strange, you know? Because Krishna fell ill, this boy got an opportunity. Very nice boy, like my own son. Akash G... Sir sir sir sir sir. Akash Gupta cheating sir. Cheating.
