In inertial frames of references, the object is at rest or it is at motion in constant velocity. In non-inertial frames of references, the object is in acceleration. So in order to apply Newton's law of motion, we need to apply pseudo force in non-inertial frames of references. Very good Chandrakant. Well done.

Have we paid for this or is this some kind of a joke? Let's go. In two months now, an old dream of ours will become reality. Genius Infinity will become Genius CBSE Junior College. This means your board certificates will come from our college, and not from Modern Senior School. What's he talking about? Nothing, he's a bloody motherfucker. He used to suck the blood out of 300 students earlier, now it will be 3000. World class facilities! That's what he wants from us. You've been here only a week. How do you know all of this? You study books. I study people. Who is Chudail? Come out. And why is your name Chudail? Because you go around frightening students at night dressed as a witch. I get it! If your father has lots of money, ask him to distribute it amongst the students here. No point wasting it on you. Who else was with you? No one, sir. Sir sir sir! His name is Aakash Gupta sir. Aakash Gupta! Aakash Gupta! Yes sir. - I didn't do anything sir. - Silence! Enough of this nonsense. Everyone turn your heads to look at that boy. You can decide either to become like him, or... look here. You can study and go to IIT. The choice is yours. You two! Consider this your last warning. This time you get punished, next time you'll go home. Understood? - Sorry sir. - Sorry sir. Hey Chudail, look here! Hey Chudail, look here! Hey Chudail, look up here! We're killing it today! Moorthy wants us to be like robots. But we are not robots. We are artists. These walls cannot contain me. I'll pee on it. Please shut up Chudail. Listen, if you worry so much you will die. Dude, aren't you worried about IIT? Look, you scored 55%. If you worry this much about IIT... Confirmed. This is the highest you will ever reach in your life. Hello. Aakash! Where are you? And where is your phone? I've been trying since morning. Ma, they don't allow phones here. They took mine. Now I'll call from this number. That's fine, at least this way you will concentrate on your studies. How is the food there? Nothing is good, ma. Everyone is way ahead of me here. They all started their IIT training three years ago. I don't think I can get admission to IIT. Shush! Don't say that. The year has just begun. Just study hard now and you will get admission. Okay? Ma, did I make it to the third list in commerce? Uh, wait. Listen, he is asking if he has got admission in commerce. What do I say? I will tell him myself when he gets into IIT What do I tell him now? Give it to me! Are you thinking of coming back? I knew it. You must have done some mischief there by now. No papa, I haven't done anything. Look son, remember one thing. You don't get the important things in life easily. You will have to work hard. And now you've grown up. All our hopes and dreams are on you. - Do you understand? - Yes papa! I know whatever you decide will be in our best interest. And I completely trust you with that decision. I've kept the money gifted by your uncles and aunts in your bag. Use it wisely. Along with this new journey, take up this responsibility as well. Aakash, come! Aakash, come! No. When you return after passing IIT it won't be just us but all of Raipur will welcome you grandly. That's why bear with it now. Study with all your heart. Everything will be alright. Understood?
