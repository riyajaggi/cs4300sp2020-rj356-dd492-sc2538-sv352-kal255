 that's why I'm called professor. Seebeck effect is a phenomenon in which temperature difference creates a voltage difference. For example, this is a body heat torch. So the difference between the inside and outside of this Peltier tube is more than five degree celsius so obviously electricity is generated. One, two, three, four, five. See there is no battery inside but still we can see the torch light up, right? Very nice. Because of this our boys have been selected in NASA. - Congratulations boys. - Thank you, sir. Question number fourteen, B! Question number fifteen, C! Yeah! I got 60! 60! Bakri! Bala is a motherfucker! Bala is a motherfucker! Finished! Mishraji, stick the answer sheet with double sided tape. It gets wet in the water. If you find it so inconvenient, then let's cancel it. You're on your own. Hey hey, Mishraji! Why cancel? I am tired of your drama. I haven't gotten any money yet. I'll give it, Mishraji. I will. Then give! Give me 1200 rupees. Cash. Now. - Mishraji! - Now! - Mishraji. - No, credit won't work with me. Don't even think about it. 200 rupees? I don't have it right now, take it in the evening. Leave it. Cancel it then. - Really? Should I go? Cancel? - Yes, cancel. Give me back the money. Hey hey... Why're you getting upset? I know you'll give it to me in the evening. Next time, remember each answer sheet will cost you 700 rupees. - 600! - 650! - 625! - 630! 627, done. God! What kind of an idiot am I dealing with here. Wow! Mugging while shitting! Shut up! Both aren't happening. Listen, don't get so tense. First your bowels will stop, then your brain and then suicide. Classic. What should I do? I don't have 627 rupees. Aakash! Aakash! Look at those two. Love birds. Look ahead. You'll get us in trouble. Sir? Sir! Toilet. Sir... Me too. Go. Sir? May I come in? Sir? Come come, fast. Sir sir, one last question. Sir last two minutes, sir please! Sir, I know these. Sir please! Even if you get two years, you will not finish. Question number six, C! Question number seven, B! Question number eight, C! Question number nine, B! Question number ten, D! Question number eleven, B! Yes! What? Don't you guys study? Question number twelve, C! Mr. Reddy, Krishna brilliant student. Mrs. Rao, Chandrakant super brilliant. Both of them. But got into NASA. Very good. I am very happy. Very happy. Who's she? Chandu's mother. - Isn't she hot? - What? What happened to Chandu? Let's go find Mishra. You guys go. Pressure? Do you need medicine? No dude, I have to make a call. Go on ahead. I'll see you later. Okay. Come on Bakri, let's go. Bakri. Let's go dude. Come on. Bakri come! Hurry up! Hello ma! How was your exam? Hello papa. It was alright. Alright means 90%? No papa. Nobody scores that much here. These are weekly tests. They happen every Sunday. Even the topper does not score more than 70%. Really? How much did you get last week? I don't remember papa. What do you mean you don't remember. Think and tell me. Around ten. Ten what? 10%? Just ten. Out of? 360. But papa I am working hard and will definitely get better. You're working hard and yet not able to perform well. What are you trying to say? Papa. Everyone here... Huh? What? Papa, everyone cheats in the exams here. Excellent. You have an answer for everything but your exams. Papa, I have to go to the bathroom - Hello? He... Rakesh Verupalli. Rakesh, collect courier from office. Everything okay? Yeah, okay. How about you? Everything okay? Yeah, okay. How was the exam? Good, good. Good. Were you crying? No. Were you crying? No, just a little stressed. Nothing much. Why? I was studying till 4 in the morning and yet couldn't finish the syllabus. That's a mistake. Don't stay up all night before the exam. The brain needs proper rest. If you sleep well, your brain will function 50% faster. Do they teach you all of this in section A? Yes. But I have a few of my own techniques. Okay, I have to go. Krishna? Yes? You section A guys are so lucky. What luck? If you work hard enough, you will be promoted to section A too. - Really? - Yes. I want to work hard. Listen! Yeah? Will you help me? Obviously, bro. Krishna! Can we sit together today evening? Not today. I'm a little stressed. Why? What happened? It's the NASA project. Oh NASA! Congratulations dude! Three months in America, nice. Life is set for you. How does it feel? Very nice. But we are not going now. Why? Moorthy sir did not give permission. A student was selected last year but when he got back he was running behind syllabus and couldn't catch up. He did not even get through to IIT. It's okay. Don't worry. Anyway, when can we sit? Tomorrow morning. Okay. Love you. All boys, breakfast is ready. Hi, Krishna! Dude, I have a doubt. Yeah, tell me. Why are you studying English? Because the next lecture is English. Time waste, okay. English is a CBSE subject not IIT. Better start with Maths early in the morning when your mind is fresh. Okay! Stop studying these NCERT books man. Just read from the study material, that's it. We didn't get any study material. Really? Take this. Thanks! Poetry, it comes from your heart and your soul. The road not taken. Written by a man full of soul! I've also written something. Should I? Go on! My heart is big, while life is tiny... File for divorce, then come meet me. Hey Krishna! How do I solve this sum? This is a very basic sum. Actually do one thing, you finish the NCERT books first and then come to the study material. Okay? Okay! Take this. Bye. Bye! My heart is a ship that is sinking in your love. My heart is a ship that is sinking in your love. Marry me, I won't ask for any dowry, my dove. It's horrible, Bakri. Hurry up! Why? You and Krishna are going to... Ya, do you want to join us? I don't do it with boys. No seriously, he is going to teach probability. Come and learn. What will you get by studying probability? I'll score well and then move to section A. What will you do by not studying? Who told you about moving to section A? Krishna said so. It's really easy. Measure it from here. Shall I get rid of Chandu? What? In the jungle, when the lion wants to marry the lioness, do you know what he does? He kills the lioness' cubs. Lions don't marry, Bakri. Really? But still. Bala is a motherfucker! Bala is a motherfucker! Not again! Okay! Aakash is a... Motherfucker! Do you know how many have moved from section D to A in the last five years? Zero. So what's the probability? Zero. Why do you always think negatively? It's not about thinking negatively. Think about it. Section D has the worst students and the worst teachers. They don't care about us. That's only because our 10th standard marks were not good. But now is the time for a change. What are you going to change? They know only the ones in section A will get a good rank. The ones in section D only want to pass CBSE. If you get stuck with IIT, you won't even pass CBSE. Right, Bakri? Where is Bakri? Calling home? Yes! By the way, are you a Brahmin? NO! Shit! Show me! How much did you get this for? I don't know. But yeah, supposed to be lucky. Papa gifted. I don't know about luck, but you're definitely lucky. Hey, who is that? Sir, one more chapter sir, please. Alright! Thank you, sir. Question number six, A! Question number seven, B! Question number eight, C! Question number nine, A! How were your exams? I'm studying well, attempting all questions. Still not able to score marks. Why are you attempting all? Clearing IIT is not about knowledge, it is about strategies. You pick your strongest subject and go all out with it. Just attempt 40%, you'll qualify easily, okay? Ok see Aakash, let's take a simple question. If you roll a dice, what is the probability of getting four? 50/50 How? Either it will be four or not. That makes it 50/50 No, that's not it. Look, when I play snakes and ladder, I always end up at the snake's mouth. I never get a four when I need it. Seriously Aakash, are you joking? Just concentrate, okay? I won't be around later. I'll be leaving soon. Where are you going? NASA! Moorthy allowed? Shh! No, I allowed myself. Krishna? He lied to my father. You have to do these things. Your father agreed? He will. Shit dude. I'm going to miss you. Take this. I hope it's lucky for you. Thanks. Gym and all, I don't believe in gym only. - I believe... - I believe in diet. Sir, toilet? Sir... Me too. Sir... Toilet.
