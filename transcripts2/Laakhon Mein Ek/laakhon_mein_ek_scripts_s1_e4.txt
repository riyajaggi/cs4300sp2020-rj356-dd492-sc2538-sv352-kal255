 Where are you going? I have to go take a shit. This is all so silly. Kids and their personal problems. Don't take it too seriously. This Chandrakant for example is a genius fellow. Genius! But emotionally he is very volatile. What to do, we have to handle everybody. And this! Anybody can do this, write on a piece of paper... Sir please! Yes of course. I understand. Mr. Ramesh... As gentlemen, I am sure we can come to a compromise? There is no scope for compromise. You run your institute properly before trying to expand. Let's go. Nothing will happen. Nothing. It's handwritten. It's just a normal answer sheet. Anybody could have written it. You don't worry. Motherfucker! Chudail! I have an idea. Say it, motherfucker! What's with the suspense? I'll go tell Moorthy the truth. What? Why? Are you Harishchandra? Whatever he asks, just say you don't know anything. Dude, let me confess. Honesty might help. Fuck that! Just don't be scared. - Don't pussy out. - But... Listen. Nothing will happen. Just relax. Aakash Gupta! Come to the Moorthy sir's office! So, Aakash Gupta. Ready to go home? Cheater. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I didn't do that on purpose. I didn't mean. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. What is the meaning of this? Sir, Aakash Gupta was cheating in the bathroom. You called me a cheater? Why will I cheat sir? Sir this 55% boy does not belong in section A sir. Sir, he bullies me! Look, he even spat at me! Hey, I only did that once! Shut up, you liar! Why will I lie? You cheater! I'm a cheater? Sir, he uses my shampoo! Sir he uses my shampoo! Yesterday you finished my packet of shampoo! Bloody liar. You are using my shampoo. Arun has been using your shampoo. You are lying. Sir he is lying. - You shut up. - Let me talk. Stop this nonsense! Get out! - Sir, he... - Out. Sorry, sir. What happened? I confessed everything. Fuck. And? He said it's okay. Don't do it again. Seriously? Then I guess, I should also confess. Dude I'm kidding. I didn't say anything. Is this the time to be funny? Sorry, sorry. Hey, stop hitting! Sorry. Everything will be okay now. Yeah, we were so scared. Things should be okay now. Life set. Chudail! There's still one problem. Sir! Answers are correct. Sir we will expel all the students involved. Very good! I'll cut their fees also. We want more students! Not less! Yes sir. - This is your fuck up! - No sir. Yes! Your fuck up! Students will cheat, that is in their nature! It's your job to put them in line! Obviously you're not qualified enough for it! - Sir... - You're not! Someone from the administration has been leaking the answer sheets. A teacher is doing this? Could be. Who else has access to the answer sheets? Me sir! And the peon. God please help me. What do I do? Back to the village? Or stay here? No, not the village. Mishraji, don't worry. Just don't say anything to anyone. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine, motherfucker! My life is ruined! You can't even cheat properly! I trusted you! Boss will get me arrested. Move! Motherfucker! I'm fucked. I had fucking dreams, you've spoiled everything. You've ruined me. All my dreams are fucked. Listen, Mishraji, nothing will happen. Anybody could have written 'ABCD' on the paper. Your stupidity has fucked me enough, please leave now. Enough of this sympathy, go now. - Spare me. Go. - Listen. Take this. Keep your mouth shut and I'll give you three more. What about the rest? I don't have the rest now, I'll give it to you later. Cancel. Cancel, cancel. He never has money. Let me. Here, one, two and three. - Fine, Mishraji? - What's that? Yeah. - I'm going. - Where? Home. Oh God! I'll never do it again. I've made all the money I could. Now I'll go to my girlfriend... Mishra! Motherfucker! What happened? Sir, Mishra ran away sir. So what should I do? Sir! I tried to catch him, sir. He was very fast! - He scratched me also. - You're fired! You're the one who supplied the answer sheet. No sir. Found in Mishra's room, sir. So? Mishra used to drink! No sir, there is more stuff there. Then go and get the more stuff! Yes sir! Right away. Ten packets of small cigarettes. Three packets of big cigarettes. Six bottles of cold drinks. Three... Which motherfucker drinks this? Write three bottles of country liquor. Three packets of weed. Two... Two packets of chips? Did he shove the rest up his ass? Are you crazy? What are you doing? His room is going to be checked. Understood? They only know he was helping students cheat. Let's keep it that way. Where will you keep all this? I'll sell it for half the price! Are you mad? Just find a dustbin and dump it or leave it in the bathroom. Aakash, we have lost so much money. Let's recover some of it at least. Foreign? Keep this. Why do you do this shit? Can you not live like normal people? We'll all get caught because of you. It's because of my stupid shit that you went to section A. Don't try to tell me what I should and shouldn't do. Got it! Still hasn't got the medicines. Write four chocolates. One banana chips. Chudail. Hey, Chudail. Listen... Sorry dude. I yelled at you for nothing. Sorry. Even I yelled back. Sorry sir. How are the things not there? Why did you lie? Not lying sir. You helped the peon run away. You stole the answer sheets from that room! - You lied about the things in his room. - No sir. Please, sir. I'm a stupid fellow sir. I'm not able to think so much. Someone has to take responsibility for everything. I'll go find Mishra at station, sir. - And if he's not there? - Not there? Bus stop. No. Sir! Should we cancel the cultural evening? What happened Dilip? Nothing, just feeling a little sick. Are you guys not going for the cultural evening? What! They didn't cancel the cultural evening? - Awesome. - Excellent! So it's done. Dodged that one! But from now on, we won't cheat. We'll study honestly. Okay? Mr. Honest, let's go down to the cultural event. Hey, sound guy! Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Genius Infinity's cultural evening. And after all the performances, our respected judges will announce the winners. And our Moorthy sir will give away the special prizes. It's a party, bro. Now, I'd like to call upon Saurav sir to recite a small poem. Hey Chandu! Hey Chandu, what are you doing here? Licking the professor's asses? What's the point? He can't get into IIT. The rest of your life. Cause he's not Chandra-can he's Chandra-cant. The poem is 'The Road Not Taken'. Two roads, diverged. Why not three? Two! Do you know what would happen to you if you had pulled this stunt in my village? They would've torn you apart.. Chandu, fucker! Thank you, thank you. Hi sir, very well organised sir. Thank you. Sir, I am a little behind in the syllabus so can you take some extra classes? Yes, sure. Let's do it Sunday afternoon? - Okay sir. - Okay? Keep working hard. Thank you so much sir. I was working hard but they don't really teach much in section D. Okay, okay. Thank you. This game is called 'The Mouse in the Field.' Kodoth sir, please come here. Bakri! Bakri! Bakri! Please clap for Kodoth sir. Remove a mouse from this field. Look at it properly. Show it to the audience. This is the one, alright? Okay now place the mouse back anywhere in the field. Anywhere. Now look at this. I'll catch your mouse from the field. Ace of diamonds. Have fun smoking, bro! Two of clubs. Get lost! - No! - No, you won't get anything! Get lost. - Chudail? - What? Everything is half the price for you today brother. Where is the thing I gave you money for? What's the matter? Who are you, his secretary? I will fuck you up in front of everyone. And if I don't get the pill in two days, I will fuck your life also. How is that possible? Ace of diamonds. It is two of clubs. Getting confused between the cards. Bakri! Why are you ruining our rep? What is he doing? Hey! Don't laugh! He's my bro! Nine of clubs. The mouse has escaped I think. Bakri! Bakri! Bakri! You, search for your mouse and be back okay? Good job, good try. Bakri! Bakri!

Chandra Panuganti. - Chandra who? - The party was going so well! Abhishek Tiwari! Bakri, keep a cool head. What did he do? I have no idea why he's calling out names. Sir, someone has framed me. Where was the need for all this? Has Genius Infinity not given you enough that you needed to do smuggling? I am so disappointed and angry with all of you'll. I told you Genius Infinity was a place of worship. You came here to study and join IIT or you came here to become goons? Your parents will be very disappointed in all of you.

You bribed the peon! No sir, I didn't do anything. Because you stole the cheat sheet and gave it to all the students. No sir, I - It is because you, put alcohol and drugs in everybody's room.
