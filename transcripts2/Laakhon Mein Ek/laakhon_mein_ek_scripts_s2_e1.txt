 …they are shouting slogans and are very angry. -Sir any comments? Shame on the politicians! Shame on the doctors. You all have come well prepared. Very Good! Does anyone want to add anything to their statements? No. Patients' files and supplies are missing from the rural hospital. Yes, Sir. But Sir, we have submitted the testimonies of all our doctors. CHC's O.T was not functional since last year. Still, you all did the procedures over there. Huh? Great! Where you playing a game of camp?

 Sir. We made the O.T functional. Otherwise how could we have a camp? And supplies? I believe supplies were delivered two days before. A doctor with your seniority, must know that it takes more than two days to check supplies. I agree. But Ma'am, you do know the supply process in the rural areas. Even after so many obstacles, the way our team has worked is praiseworthy. Nobody could have done a better job under the given circumstances. - You could have postponed the camp. - Exactly. Why didn't you? Who was organising the camp? Dr. Shreya Pathare. Are you Dr. Shreya Pathare? You are under a bond period. Isn't it? Have you completed your training? You have no experience and you're organizing a camp. - Let me explain this... - Let me talk to her. Are you aware of the processes? What is the process? Dr. Patwardhan, how could you send somebody like this? Did you want to organize a camp or Did you just want a certificate for rural services by going to a village? How did this happen? Sickle had gone in. Good Morning, Ma'am. - When did this happen? - Some four to five days back. You must come immediately when you are wounded or it gets more infected. - Understood? - Yes. Did you take an injection for tetanus last year? So Ma'am, let me give him an injection for tetanus. And... painkillers for the pain. Absolutely! It could be Septicaemia. - Okay Ma'am. Sir, elections are approaching, what is your opinion on this? Last year, our party showed the state a new path. Roads have been built. Electricity issues have been resolved. Health Centres have been inaugurated. Next year we will make this state prosper with more determination. Sir, you talked about inaugurating health centres. But our state is lagging behind in terms of healthcare. We have complete support of the people. - You can check out the report if you wish. - I have already checked it, sir. Our nation is behind three states in terms of National Blindness Program. No more questions. Sir, sir, where are you going? Its a government order to conduct cataract camps in your district. Thirty villages have been covered in the past two years. - Only two to four are left. - Not just two or four, twelve! Targets for Blindness Program are yet to be completed. Sir, in those villages, either patients are not there or our staff. The state is lagging behind in numbers. You've got just three months to work this all out. But Sir... Mr. Patwardhan, if you are unable to do this then let us know. We'll get it done another way. No, no, Sir. It will be done. Definitely, it will be done. Ishwar... - Hey. - No, no, sit, sit. How is your son? He doesn’t study at all. I am tired of telling him. What else can we parents do! Okay, Ishwar, listen. In the next three weeks, we need 12 cataract camp supplies. So be ready with that. Previous payment is still pending, Sir. It will be done, Ishwar. We have lot of pressure from the higher authorities. Next week I will clear everything. It is 2.5 crore, Sir. It’s been seven months. People are harassing me. Where will I get the money from? Tell me one thing Ishwar. In the last ten years, did you ever incur loss because of us? Send the supplies. As soon as the money comes, I myself will come and give you the cheque. Fine? Listen, I am arranging. Yes. - Hey, What are you doing? - Don't whine, eat this. Hey, let her eat. She is hungry since ages. You know guys, Dr. Madhavi is awesome. Just by looking at the wound, she said that it's Septicaemia. I am wondering when we will reach that stage. This is called experience. And anyways, she has a good setting with Dr. Madhavi. If you stay with her, you will come to know everything. Bring chutney also. Oh God! Be careful! Wildlings. During my time, I don’t know what all was happening. Yes, Dude! Here I am collecting a sample of urine and stool. Being a doctor also, I got no respect. Respect? Have you seen your face? First take a look at yourself. Ankit, what about that camp? - Have you got anyone? - Which camp? Patwardhan Sir is searching for a volunteer to send to the village. - You want to go? - Mad or what? Who wants to go to a village? Whom did he ask? Him? What did you say? My brother’s getting married. He got married last month. Then what happened last month? Sir, that was third brother’s marriage. Fourth one's getting married now. - Really? - Yes. - And he agreed? - This time I said it with a lot of feelings. Listen, Raajan. Yes, sir. Why didn't you volunteer for the camp? My contract expires next week, Sir. So, I have to book tickets. Dr. Raghav, Dr. Ra... Hey, come here! I really miss my home. That is why I have to go. Okay. You go. Dr. Apte! Hello! Sir, what are you saying? Ma’am, I tried, but no one is ready. Actually, travelling is a problem, otherwise I would have gone. Oh! No, no, ma’am. You... Send someone who is a junior. She won’t send me without asking me. Right? You start thinking of an excuse. If I don’t stay here then who will look after Ophthalmology department. No, Sir. The second floor... - work is going on. - Okay. You go. What am I supposed to say? I can't go because I'm a lady. Because there are no proper toilets? Then tell him that you want to complete your studies. Go, go. You tell him that I am scared of staying alone. What about you? Sir, I am in administration. There is already a shortage in administration. - Asthma? - Yes. Suddenly it appeared out of nowhere? Because there is nothing in the records. - Can I tell you one thing? - Sure. Tell him that your father is getting married for the second time. Don't bring my dad into this. We will also attend your father’s marriage. There is a limit of imagining things. Nonsense. Take a deep breath. She is stable. We should be able to shift her tomorrow. Tonight let her stay under observation. Check her vitals on hourly basis. - If anything happens, let me know. - Yes, ma’am. Brother, If he abuses me I have to hit him, right? He has filed a case against me Let's see which cop has the guts to touch me. - It’s been so long. - Sir, five minutes more. I am waiting here for 15 minutes. - They will come in sometime. - Yes. Is this how you are going to run your hospital? Doctors are not on time. What happened? - Is she a doctor? - Yes, I am a doctor. Tell me. Hello! Madam. It’s an emergency. Please take the details. Name: Rajiv Kashikar. Age: 33. Heart attack… Okay, I will note down the details later, first call the patient. Why you want to see the patient? I am giving you all the details. I didn’t know that he is a lawyer’s son. Nothing. It’s a small case. I will take care of it. Why do you want to do a checkup? I am telling you. It doesn’t work like this. First let the patient come and then we will complete all the formalities. Call Keshav. There is no need to call Dr. Keshav. I am a junior doctor. Tell me. Junior doctor. - Call Keshav, please. - Stay here only. Yes. I will definitely talk. Please call Keshav. I will call you later. Stop shouting and stop saying… Hey, stop telling me all this. - Do as I am saying. - Lower your voice. Inside... She is a lady. Don’t talk like that. Apologize. Brother, she is saying that she wants to do a check up. I am sorry. Please tell me what the issue is. I am trying to explain that you call your patient, I myself will do the check up. And if in case, we have to admit, then we will do that also. Any which ways, the ICU is full. As soon as we are done with the check up, we will complete the formalities. Correct. The rules are rules. She is doing her job and you are yelling at her. Huh? You just call the patient. I am the patient. You are the patient? Yes, I am the patient. You do the check up. Please check. What's the problem? Heart attack. Your pulse rate is little high. I will prescribe the medicines. He will give it you. You please wait there. You are making a mistake. I think you are mistaken. You please check again. You will find heart attack. I have already checked once. If I check again, it will not make any difference. Junior. It’s okay. You call your senior doctor. Look, I am the doctor on duty. So only what I say, will be done. And I am telling you that there is no need to admit you in the... there is. There are some rules and protocols that I am trying to follow. - I am requesting you… - There is, Madam. That even you should follow. You can’t be stubborn about it. Can you please go and wait over there? I told you that there is a need for it. Brother. Brother, listen. Raju. Keshav, we were searching for you since a long time. Dr. Keshav, they came here forcibly and… One minute Shreya. What needs to be done? There is an emergency. It’s heart attack. Sir, there is no emergency and ICU… Let me handle this. What is the status of ICU? Sir, ICU is full. Dr. Madhavi’s patient… Shift her outside and take him inside. - Dr. Madhavi has given standing instructions… Look, you please go from here. - Sir. - Now. Raja Babu, come Come on, leave it now. It will get soiled again after two days. Give. Five clothes, please give it to the laundry man by evening. Shreya, please come and sit here. What will you do there? Not everyone is as lucky as you they get rural posting in Panvel. I will miss you too. Do you... remember that ward boy? He was little and had a weird haircut. Of course I remember. The guy took 500 rupees. When you came to the room for the first time? He was going to inform the Super. - Really? - Yes. What a quarter! Power outages all the time. Yes. Do you remember Dr. Manoj? The one with the french beard. He has some tricks, alright. He gets postings done for four lakhs instead of ten. Hmm? Karan, We have spoken about this. Alright, I will take money on credit from your father. - I will repay him in two years. - No. Shreya, you don't understand. It won't happen the way you think. Rural service, these villagers, it all sounds nice, when you hear it. Everyone is wicked. That place is not for you, nor for anyone of us. Well, I won't get to know before going. Shreya, come on. Karan, come on. This is important for me One year is a very long time. Everything changes. I could change, you could change. Right? Okay. If you are so scared then... come with me. Shreya, I have invested seven years over here. And I have got a private hospital after going through much trouble. And may be I could get a chance to go to U.S. next year. Karan, I am joking. It's just about one year, I would be back before you know it. And then, like you said... U.S. What? Are you planning to go alone? Omelette is nice. - Right? - Hmm. It is tasty. I was going to meet the MLA. What should I tell? Are you still the CMO of this hospital? Raja Babu, I don’t think you should involve MLA in this matter which is not so big. What if it becomes big? It won’t. I didn't let this happen yesterday too.? I managed it. Right? Raja Babu, she is just a kid Please forgive her. Why should parents suffer for the deeds of their children? Ma’am, it was too late And I didn’t want to disturb you. At least, you could have dropped a message. Shreya, you cannot handle everything all by yourself. Okay? Yes, Ma’am. Ma’am, CMO is calling Dr. Shreya. Sir? Yes, come. Sit. I am sorry, Sir. You should have handled it tactfully. These type of problems will occur quite often. Yes Sir. I am sorry, Sir. - That patient is stable now. - I am talking about Raja Babu. Raja Babu and his family, have helped us a lot with the infrastructure of this hospital. We can’t afford to lose them. Whatever you did was not at all wrong. It was little immature. Yes Sir. And listen, from day after tomorrow, your rural posting is in Sitlapur. There you have to organize a cataract camp. But Sir, toilet? What? But Sir, how will I operate? You don’t have to operate. It’s just that you have to organize a cataract camp. You will learn a lot. It’s a good opportunity. You do one thing. Think over it and let me know by tomorrow. Okay? “Happy birthday to you.” “Happy birthday to you.” What? You're going to camp? You guys are useless as friends. I want to go but my home is under renovation. Tickets are already booked. I could have cancelled it But my family... misses me a lot. - Excuse me, Ma’am? - Sorry. - It’s okay. - Okay Ma’am, I will let you know. - Okay. - Hi, Ma’am. - Hi. Where is your drink? - Just got over. - Wait. - Ma’am, I will have whiskey. - Have it. Oh okay. - Ma’am, enough. - Sure? Yes. - So cheers! - Cheers Ma’am! What? Ma’am, this morning I had a word with Gopal Sir. So he said that from day after tomorrow. -I have been given rural posting Oh! Then you are going to Sitlapur? Good. Ma’am actually I wanted to talk to you regarding this. Here I am getting to learn so many things from you and there, I doubt if I will be able to study. Whatever you learn there would be a completely different experience. - But Ma’am… - Trust me. Ma’am only three months of the training is left. But you will be back in a month. I am not feeling too confident about it ma’am. Okay then. Don’t go. Really, Ma’am? I will go. Someone has to go. Right? But you… How is that possible? Hey, Shreya. What are you doing here? There is so much fun. Just a minute! Sorry, Ma’am. Music has started... It’s okay.
