To the residents of Sitlapur, you all are welcome on the first day of camp. I don't want to. I don't want any operation. Uncle, this operation is for the eyes, not for the heart. But, I don't want to have any operation. He is a very respectable doctor from the city. In just 10 minutes, he will take out the cataract from your eyes. Why are you scared? I'm getting scared? Why are you forcing me? Oh, Uncle... Move. Why are you getting angry? Sir... Betadine. Next patient, please. -Next. Bhola, tell Sarvesh to be ready with all the medicines. Okay? - Be careful. - Come. - Take him there. - Yes. And that, which is kept over there... We asked for the medicines half an hour back. What is your team up to? I'll just go and check, Sir.

Food is my department... Will you guys stop chatting? Go and work. Madam, I'm coming with the file. Next patient. Next.

So Rupa, tell me how did you become a nurse? I... actually, my house is close to the hospital... So, I became a nurse. Okay. Sona? Actually... it was like... She is my childhood friend. She joined medical and so I also joined Madam, the thing is, wherever they go... They go together. Madam, they are actually, 'Changu and Mangu'. 'Changu and Mangu' - Changu and Mangu - Stop it. And you? Madam, everyone in my family is a pharmacist. So, I became a pharmacist and came here. Madam, the fact is, he couldn't have become anything else. Shut up. He talks nonsense. And what about you Bhola? - Me, what? - Yes. What made you come here? Say it. Tell. - What happened? - Feeling shy. - Bhola... - I want to know. Say it. Tell. Actually, madam... I wanted to save life. Did you just see, madam? That is why, I was not saying it. They have no value for the feelings. That is why, I was not saying. Sona? No one will laugh. No. You are absolutely right. That is very good. - See, what madam is saying? - Very nice. - See. - Madam, what about you? - Why did you become a doctor? - My reason is very simple. I got 92% in Biology. So, my parents, relatives, teachers and everyone else thought that, I should do this. It's a noble profession. You get respect. - Respect is there, madam. - Yes. Yes. But, if I had known how stressful it is ...I probably wouldn't have. That's also correct. It's hard. Very hard. Madam... thanks to you too. This camp would have been impossible without you. Really. - Really. - Madam... She is such a hypocrite. Do you know, what she said? She said, you would run away from here in just few days. - He is lying. - She had even bet 500 rupees. - Madam, he said five days, I said 10. - I gave her 500 rupees. Madam, she is lying. He is lying. He said, madam will be here for just four days and after that she will fly away. Madam, I told them a story of a bird. - Why are you mixing bird's story with this? - Yes, you are right. - Bhola, you always... - And you? Not me. No. Thank you, Sona. You at least said a double digit number. You guys are so bad. So, I stayed back, didn't I? Now I should get the money. Right? - Come on. Give it to me. - Take it from him. Ma'am, take it from him. - Take 500 rupees from Bhola. - Bhola, give it to the madam. Yes. No issues. Hello. - Can you see anything? - It's very blurry. Did you scratch your eyes? I don't remember. But, I don't think so. - Give him the drops and do the dressing. - Okay, Sir. There is only redness in the eyes. It is not watering. - So, nothing to worry. - But, why is it hurting? They are villagers. He must have scratched his eyes. You just saw it. Can we check with Doctor Pednekar once? Ma'am, tomorrow, the entire day, we have surgeries lined up. And now, it's too late. I am also here. You don't get tensed. Does it pain? - It pains a little bit. - Any other problem? - I can't see clearly, Doctor. - You will. It will be there for two, three days, then, it will be fine. Don't worry. Close it. Give them antibiotics and do the dressing. Let's go. Hello Gopal, good morning. Sorry to disturb you so early. No problem. Tell me. There are seven patients here, whose eyes are excessively red and it's watering also. I would suggest, let us just shift them to DHC immediately. How serious is it? Well, it's too early to say anything. But, we need to do tests. Okay. Shift them immediately. Yes. Thank you. Let's go. - How soon can we arrange the transport? - An hour. - Arrange for transport, we are shifting the villagers. Sir, we are taking the villagers outside. What should we say, if their relatives ask about them? What will we say? They have allergic reactions? If your questions are over, can we shift them to DHC? - Don't rush. - Easy. There is no hurry, Sir. Easy. Yes. Hold it. You sit here. - Can I sit here? - Yes, Sit. Come, Uncle. We are just going for regular check up. Okay? I'll make you sit here. Yes, sit here. Hello. Ishwar Sir, they are taking all the patients to the district hospital. - Why? What happened? - I don't know. - Whose medicines were used? - You had supplied. -Do one thing. Hide the O.T register. - How can I do this? Idiot, can you just fuck off! Cut the call. - Easy. - Come. Come. They have taken all patients somewhere. - Where? - I don't know. But everyone is going there. Let's go. Ankit, keep the special ward ready. Doctor Pednekar is coming here with the patients. And inform Shreya to be ready with the OT register. We need to do an urgent meeting. - Okay, Sir. - Go. And one more thing... - No press. - Sure, Sir. Dr. Keshav, the moment swab report comes in send it for culture. Ma'am, you come with me. We have to meet the minister. Shreya, you go and get the other patients. Yes. Come. Take them upstairs. Bhola, where is father? Where is father? Sir has been taken to the district hospital. He will come soon. How can they take him without informing us? They need to do few simple tests. It will get over soon. He will come now. - Couldn't the tests get done here? - Why didn't you ask us? - Bittoo, keep quiet. - Can we go to the hospital? - Madam is along with them. Go home. - Bhola... Let's go. Let's go. Not to worry. Take him. Come. Madam, you please wait here. How much time will you wait here? Bittoo, come. - Why are they not letting me go inside? - Nobody has the permission. - Can you please tell them once, please? - Gopal Sir, said no. All these people joined the camp because of me. Look at their faces. They have no clue, what's happening. If I go in, I can at least explain. What can we do? - By when will the reports come? - They should be here by tonight. Will everything be okay? Look, you yourself are getting stressed and you are making us stressed as well. Nothing will happen. Relax. Don't take stress. Do one thing. Get the OT register. Gopal Sir, would ask for it as soon as he comes. I don't have the OT register. Where is it? It's in CHC. What about the supply list? Everything happened so fast that, it got left at CHC. Okay. Do you have the sanitization certificates? Okay. Do one thing. You call up and get everything here. Because we don't have the camp reports anywhere else. Go. - Tell me the truth. What's happening? - Madam is with them. They will come soon. When will they come? - Tell me the truth, Bhola. - Trust me. Madam will get them along with her. - What happened? - Nobody is answering. - Try calling again. - I have already called three times. How could I be such a fool and leave all the reports behind? We'll think of something or the other... - Are you Doctor Shreya Pathare? - Yes. Ma'am as per our sources, the patients at the cataract camp organised by you Have lost their sight. - You want to say something about this? - Hello, hello... stop this camera first. - We are from the press. - You go out. - Press. - You go there. - Pulkit, remove them from here. - You guys leave. Stop all this. The cataract camp organised by you for the patients. They are now losing their sight. Look, this is a hospital. Shooting is not allowed here. Stop shooting. People have lost their sight. Would you like to say something? The success ratio in cataract operations are 99% and you all manage to botch that up? Sir. Investigation is on. And why are we panicking? Let the reports come. And secondly, there has been no report of any blindness. What if they do? Suppose a patient says in front of the camera that he can't see anything, then... it will be all over. Sir, we have got the situation under control. Treatment is going on in the civil hospitals. If there is a fungal infection in the report... Stop using medical jargon. And just tell me, whether they are going to lose their eyesight or not. - Sir, we are trying. - Don't try. Stop trying and resolve the issue. Yes, tell me. Just now we have got the news that, the cataract camp organised by the government in Sitlapur, has made 30 patients lose their eye sight. Everyone has lost their eye sight. Motherfuckers. Bastards. Motherfuckers. What drama is going on? What are they thinking? The entire hospital has been blocked. The authorities are not answering on this matter. As you can see in this photograph, this camp was organised by Shreya Pathare. The patients were then taken to the district hospital from Sitlapur, secretly. Leave me. Bhola... - Bhola... - Bhola... The government has transferred these patients very discreetly from From Sitlapur to Sambhajinagar district hospital. The hospital is under heavy security? And there is no response from the authorities. What can be the reason for these patients to go blind? For more updates, keep on watching IN TV. Sister, saline. - Bhanu... syringe? - Yes. Sir, give it to me. Look up. Down. Is it paining? Don't worry. It will be fine. Send his swab for culture. Hand over the report to me as soon as it comes. Yes.
