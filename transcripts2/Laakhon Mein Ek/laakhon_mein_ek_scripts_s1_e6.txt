 Nonsense! So all the contractors, lawyers, artists and pilots in the world are idiots? You're not getting it, IIT is my papa's dream, Bakri! Then let your father jump. Why are you jumping? What is your dream? What do you want? I don't know. When you don't know what you want, then first figure out what you don't want. I don't want this, Bakri! I don't want to do IIT. I want to get out of here right now. Tomorrow morning you leave. Bakri you're not getting it. If you hadn't reached in time, I would've jumped. I would have died. Bakri please. Get me out of here. I can't live one more second in this hell. Bakri please. Okay. Come on. All boys remain inside rooms. I repeat. All boys remain inside rooms. What's happening here? They've locked everyone inside.

What is going on here? Where are you taking them? Answer me! You destroyed everything! You section D bastards, you destroy everything! All I wanted to do was study! But you came and spoiled everything! You think you are smart! You know how much everyone wants me to be the topper for IIT! Even if I come second, my parents won't be happy! They'll hit me! I also want to see movies, I also want to have fun! But I control and I study. I control and I study! Let's go, Bakri. Come on. - I'll show you the CCTV footage. - Okay. Don't use the portion where the section A boys are. I want these other wasteful boys' parents to pay for this damage. Come. Why did you even bother to come to a place like this. Because you lied to my parents, sir. You knew I wasn't meant for IIT, and yet you lied! Fuck you sir! Fuck you! I lied to your parents? What about you? How do you think they're going to feel, when they hear about what you've done today? Disgusting filth. No parent deserves a child like you. Take him away. Aakash? Aakash come quickly. Aakash! Dude, we heard you went to jail? Who said that? Everyone is talking about it. Right? Are you crazy? Nothing like that. Forget that. What are your plans now? Not sure, let's see. What do you mean let's see? Will you waste this year? No, I mean... I will choose between Arts or Commerce. Pick Commerce! You got in last year so you'll get in this year for sure. What? Your name was on the third list. Didn't you get the acceptance letter? Papa. You both lied to me? You did good for me. Are you happy now? Is this how you talk to your father? You can't do one thing properly and this is your attitude? Bloody criminal! Why can't you guys understand? I was never going to get into IIT. And I never will. I don't have the aptitude Papa! Why don't you have the aptitude? It's because you're lazy! You don't know how to work hard. You keep going on about hard work! You work hard right? What have you achieved? You just run a small saree shop in Raipur. Have you forgotten how to speak to your own father? From now on, you will study Science at Raipur University after which you will go next door to Anand Academy for IIT training. I made a mistake by sending you away. Now you will study here, right in front of me. From here on, you will do as I say. Or get out of this house. What are you two talking about? Dinner is ready, come. Let's eat. Yes, Ma. You begin... I'll be back. Sir, thank you. Once again I am thanking you. You have done a very good job. We take any point A inside the fluid and... Very good Chandrakant. Well done. When did I...
