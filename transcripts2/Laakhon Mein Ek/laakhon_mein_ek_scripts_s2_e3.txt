There is no time to breathe. How will I study? Do medical stores have good scope in the cities? - For you eyes... - At least keep one. I'm tired now of convincing people for the camp. Villagers. Free, free, free. - There is only one way through which... - Free. Yours is not finished yet? You should just see my face. I have become tan. Grab it. Grab it. Grab it. - Free operation... - Bhola! How was the publicity? - Is there anyone else at your home... - Listen. Sorry. Madam. You didn't tell me anything regarding the medical store... 'Proper light came from retina...' Madam, this is my childhood dream. Yes, Baba. Everything is going good. Aunty, why are you not listening? Oh Shit! Aunty, are you mad? What more we can do, madam? Everything will be all right. You don't worry. Raja, talk to Mr. Patil and fix the meeting. Okay. I'll do it. - Hello, doctor. How are you? - I'm fine.

Today is not possible. Sorry for that. - Raja, talk to the doctor. Okay? - Yes, Sir. - Bye. - Bye. Come. Come Sir. Yes. I have got no clue. What should I say to Ishwar? That your money is not coming but continue with your supply of medicines. Money will come. It's in the pipeline, Raja Babu. Sir. When the money will come out of the pipeline only then the bucket will be filled. We have been doing this always. We will keep on doing the same. I can understand your problem. But you also understand our problem. As doctors, we deal with the pressures of the patients and their families. You and Ishwar know each other for so many years. Why don't you try and explain this to him? Raja Sir, only one week. I'll speak with the higher authority and clear everything in a week. Sir, you do get your salary on time from the higher authorities. Isn't it? Then why is this getting delayed? If the Government is not giving your money then, what should we do? You talk to the Government. To invest more on medicines and less on elections. Bye. One, Two, Three. Greetings. - Hello, Sir. - Stay blessed. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you Sir? - I'm fine. - Sit. - Yes. Again?

This is a big order. We can't let it go. "Fig tree is by the riverside." "This is the birthplace of Bhujanga." Rivers flooded... due to the rains. Rivers flooded... due to the rains Due to the pressure of floods, the snake got swept away. Madam. Upstairs, when they talk to you, be mindful of what you say. Bhola. You could have hired people from outside to get the work done. From where? Who is left here? But, 30,000 rupees? Every time you have to think about money only? Huh? But what will we eat? Are we dying of hunger now? - Hey, Bhola. - Gandharv, dada. - How are you? - Hello. Hey, Bhola. - Hello. - Bhola, sit. Stay blessed. - Hello. - Hello. - Sit down. - Yes. Wow. She is so beautiful. She looks like Goddess Sita. Doesn't she? Did you have a tour of Sitlapur? Little bit... - Bhola talks a lot about you all. - Yes. So I thought to come and meet you all. Sir, I saw your work. It's very beautiful. Dear, this is a blessing from Baburaoji. He taught us all of this. Sir, I'm Dr. Shreya Pathare and we have come from the government hospital. And we are... We are planning to set up a cataract camp here. It would be great, if you could come... See this. Everything is written on it. Look madam, we will get our treatment done. You don't need to worry about us. Thank you. Sir? I can see that you have cataract... Come, madam. I'll accompany you downstairs. Come. I don't get this. So many people in the ashram have matured cataract problems. But they will not come to the camp? Leave it, madam. Everyone is mad here. But they must be having trouble while working. There is no work, madam. Didn't you see the condition of the ashram? They will die starving, but won't come to the hospital. But why? - You know Narayan Da. - Hmm. -He had a son, Tulsi. Once, he got very sick. He was taken to the government hospital. Since then, he never returned home. Since then everybody consults Jagmohan Sir, our own village doctor. What happened, Madam? Madam? Listen Madam. Namaste Madam. You can't go inside like this. You don't come inside. Hmm. Control your temper. Okay Sir. If you control your temper then only can you control your body. Understood? And stop eating junk food. Otherwise you'll get ruined. Okay, Sir. Go. Take medicines from Bittu and leave. Take care of him. Explain him. - Hello, Jagmohan Sir. - Wait a minute. There are other patients. I am from a government hospital. Dr. Shreya Pathare. - Okay. Sit. - Yes. Everyone in the village knows you. So I thought I'd come and meet you. This is a result of all the hard work. Nothing else. - What will you have? Tea, coffee? - No. Nothing. I'm fine. Jagmohan Sir, actually we are setting up a cataract camp. So, people listen to you and do whatever you say. So, just a request... If you tell them, then they will surely visit the camp. I... I don't want to get into this camp thing. Last year, whatever happened in the vasectomy camp... No. No. This is not a vasectomy camp. This is a cataract camp and the success rate is 90 per cent. - You've come again. - Sir, how to take this? You always forget. White colour tablet in the morning. Red colour one in afternoon. And the blue one in the night. - You get it? Fine then. - Yes. Ok. Bye. Jagmohan Sir. I wanted to ask you something. - Are all your medicines... Ayurvedic? - Madam? It's mixed. Okay. Because outside on the board it's written, 'Only Ayurvedic.' Madam? We are getting late. We have lots of work, madam. Madam. Tell me one thing. You've come here for my support or to do inspection? Sir, we only want support. Ok madam. Let's go. Sir, is busy. - Let's go. - Okay. Bye. - Tell Palash, I had asked about him. - Sure. - Sir, bye. - Bye. Yes, who is next? Madam. What were you doing? Bhola, did you see those medicines? The red and blue are steroids. - Madam, it will create a scene... - Hello. Yes. I want to file a case against Jagmohan Sir. - Whose this? - I'm Dr. Shreya Pathare. Madam, we don't file complaints against doctors. Don't file complaints means? And one second. He is not a doctor. Neither does he have a license nor a certificate. In the name of medicines, he is distributing steroids. Understood? That's fine, madam. But Jagmohan Sir is the village doctor, we can't file a complaint against him. -What is your name?-Inspector Rao. Inspector Rao. You please understand one thing. These steroids, the strong ones... People can die due to overdose of these. And, if that happens, then it will be me who will give your name to the newspapers. The rest, you see and manage yourself. Madam. Madam? Why did you do this madam? Out of stock, get it from outside. Tell me? Out of stock, get it from outside. - Yes, Jatin. How are you? - Hey, Mangesh. How are you? - I'm fine. - Give me Angiflam. Angiflam is also out of stock. - Buy it from outside. - His hand is broken, please give it. I'm not lying. It's out of stock. Buy from outside. - Give some alternative. - I have your number. I will call you once it comes. Now, go. Okay, fine. And... any new leads about the hospital? Since a long time, I've got no news. I will let you know, if there is something. Okay. Come on, brother. Come forward. You are always worried about the news. Always in search of leads I'm in pain. You could have asked for one pill at least. - You are going to kill me this way. - It's our business. What do you want? You want Angiflam, right? - Surely you will get it. - From where did you get it? Why do you want to know? This man is a bit suspicious. We will buy from outside. Yeah. Buy it from outside. Outside, for Rs. 150... for something worth Rs.150 you are getting that for Rs.400. I'm giving you for Rs.100. Buy it from outside. Listen. How are you selling it below MRP? Why do you want to know? Tell me. I just want to know. Nothing else. - Listen brother, suppliers are on strike. - Okay. What would happen to the patients? We have a source, hence, helping people. And who is your source? Why do you want to know? Okay. Give me a strip of Angiflam. Why are you getting angry? Hey. What are you doing, dude? - Take this... - Take this also. Hey, you bastard. Give the medicine back! I'm going to break your other hand too. - Hey, you idiot, get lost. - Don't hit. 101? Are you are giving him medicines on time right? I do Sir. But the fever returns as soon as the medicinal effect wears off. Is it? No problem! I will change the medicine. I'm giving you another medicine. You give this to him tonight. He'll be fine by tomorrow morning. Take your medicines properly. Hey, Rao Sir. Hello. How is your mother? What is the matter? I hope she is fine. Hey, Rao Sir, tell me? Sir, you will have to shut down your clinic for a while. Why? - Why? - Sir, that complaint... Which complaint? Illegal medicines. Nothing to be worried about Sir. Clinic will be reopened in a few days. You should have used your brain a little. Do you have any idea what can happen? He is here since 20 years. He has a clinic in the middle of the market. He is worshipped by the villagers. Worshipped! Do you get it? And Bhola, what were you doing? You have brains, right? One second. I don't understand why are you shouting at us? Then what should I do? Who told you to become a revolutionary? Sir, he is quack. So did I say he is God? Ok so tomorrow if a complication arises, then what will you do? Sit at the side - and watch? - You're shouting at me... - Madam. - You go inside. - Everyone go inside. I'll take care of it. - Come all of you. What happened? Where is that madam? Duty is over. So she might be at home. What happened? Is she in the doctor's quarters behind? - Hey, have a look. - Brother, listen. What is the matter? I'll solve the matter. What will you solve? Do you understand what is going on? - Yes. - You are here since how long? Since five years? Do you understand what is happening here? She has filed a complaint against our Jagmohan Sir. She has complained right? I will talk to her tomorrow. She will withdraw the complaint. What do you mean by she will withdraw? We want her. - Call her. - She is not here. - Call her, I want to talk to her. - She didn't go anywhere. She's inside. What's it? Why are you lying? You don’t trust me? She is not here. Call her. Call her now. I want to talk to her. Brother, listen to me. - I want to talk to her. - You don't believe me? No! - Call her! - Tell me. What do want to say? Uncle. Uncle. Open the door uncle. Forgive me.
