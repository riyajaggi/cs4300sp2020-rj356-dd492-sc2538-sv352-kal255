 The Orville (2017–…): Season 1, Episode 3 - About a Girl - full transcript 
 Bortus and Klyden debate whether their newborn child should have a controversial surgery. 
 
  subslikescript horizontal links top  
 
 
 Oh, my god.
She's so adorable.
 And she's healthy.
 15 pounds, two ounces.
 About average
for a newborn Moclan.
 A female baby born to a member
of an all-male species.
 Yeah. Bortus, this kid
is one in a million.
 In fact, a Moclan female is born
 roughly once every 75 years.
 Well, here's to the
only girl in town.
 If you all do not mind,
 I would like to be alone
with my mate for a moment.
 Totally fine.
 We should be
on the bridge, anyway.
 Come on, guys.
 Congrats, you two.
 It must be done.
 Yes. I will make
the arrangements.
 Yaphit, there's nothing
wrong with you.
 Oh, I'm pretty sure
there is, doc.
 I haven't been retaining
fluids like I usually do.
 My quarters look like a swamp.
 It's a mess.
 There's absolutely no evidence
of fluid loss whatsoever.
 And-and then
there's this cough.
 Right?
 You don't have lungs,
 which means you
don't have a cough.
 Yaphit, you've been in sickbay
three times this week.
 I know what you're doing.
 Claire, look, just let me
take you out on one date.
 If you have a crappy night,
 I promise I'll never
ask you again.
 Yaphit, no.
 Besides, we're
incompatible species.
 It's impossible.
 Huh? There's more
where that came from.
 Get out.
 All right.
 How's it going, man?
 Dr. Finn.
Bortus, hi.
 Hey, have you guys settled on a
name for your little girl yet?
 We're all feeling a little funny
just calling her "the baby."
 A name would be inappropriate
at this time.
 Doctor, I require your help.
 Sure. What do you need?
 It would take two weeks
for the Orville
 to reach my home planet, Moclus,
 from our present location.
 And I do not believe the captain
would be able to divert course.
 Therefore, Klyden and I
would like you
 to perform the procedure.
 What procedure?
 To conform our child.
 To make her a male.
 Bortus, there's no way in hell
I'm doing that.
 May I ask why not?
 You have to ask?
 Because I will not perform
a sex change
 on a perfectly healthy newborn.
 You ever hear
of the Hippocratic oath?
 It is my understanding
that as a doctor,
 your duty is to cure illness.
 Bortus, this is not an illness.
 Your child was born female.
 I got news for you.
 It happens all the time.
 My world is different
than yours.
 I would hope that
you would respect that.
 I am a union doctor
serving on a union ship,
 and I will not perform a sex
change on a newborn infant.
 That's far enough, Señor.
 It's over, Vasquez.
 Surrender now and maybe we'll
ask the judge to go easy on you.
 I think maybe you are blind,
seã±or.
 You're outnumbered, and my rifle
is aimed at your head.
 There's an entire regiment
on the way.
 Give yourself up
or you die here.
 You are bluffing.
 There is no cavalry.
 You willing to take that chance?
 You shoot us,
you'll hang for it.
 Perhaps we settle this
the traditional way.
 You mean a showdown.
 If that's the way you want it.
 No, Señor. We will have
a dance contest.
 Wait, what?
What is this, man?
 What-what...
this-this is where
 we're supposed to have the showdown.
Yeah. What the hell is this?
 I have taken many years
of jazz and tap.
 If you can beat me
in a dance-off,
 I will surrender.
 Gordon, what the hell is
going on, man? What is this?
 I messed around
with the program. I wanted,
 I wanted to mix it up
a little bit. You don't like it?
 I infuse many different styles
of choreography
 to make the steps my own.
 You will be defeated, seã±or.
 Captain, I must speak with you
immediately.
 Bortus, can't it wait, man?
 We're in the middle
of a game here.
 It is a matter of great urgency.
 All right, I'll be back.
 Hey, while I'm gone,
fix this thing, huh?
 Okay. Will do.
 All right, what is so urgent?
 You know, I get, like,
one free hour a week.
 Coffee.
 Captain, Dr. Finn
has refused to perform
 a necessary medical procedure
on my child.
 Medical procedure? What kind?
 I thought she said
your kid's totally healthy.
 I have asked her to see
to the conversion of my child
 to the male gender.
 She has refused.
 I request you order her
to comply.
 You want to perform
 a transgender operation
on a baby?
 Bortus, that is
completely unethical.
 On my world, it would be
unethical not to do so.
 Why not just let the kid
decide for herself
 when she's old enough?
 Captain, in human biology,
 is there not an occasional
mutation called a cleft palate?
 Yeah, sure. What happens to a
child born with this condition?
 It's usually corrected
right after birth,
 takes about 12 seconds.
 And why do you not wait and let
the child decide for himself
 whether he wishes
to correct this condition?
 Oh, my god.
 You're kidding, right?
 Bortus, that is
completely different.
 Being a girl is not a condition.
 There are no health risks.
 Having a vagina doesn't
give you a-a lisp.
 I mean, depending
on how you use it.
 It is different for my people.
 On our planet,
there are no females.
 For you to judge us
by human standards is unfair.
 All right, look, even if
I was not against this,
 we are on a union ship.
 And, for that matter, your
planet is a member of the union.
 For me to order Claire
to do something like this
 would be in violation
of a hundred laws.
 Captain, I implore you...
 Bortus, I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna do it. All right?
 Request denied.
 Dismissed.
 There's the son of a bitch.
 How long until it collides
with the planet?
 One month, 17 days.
 Well, that gives us
a little time.
 Lieutenant Lamarr,
activate cutting beam.
 Have you checked in with Bortus?
 I gave him the rest
of the day off.
 He was pretty wound up.
 I feel so sorry for that baby.
 There's nothing sadder
than an unwanted child.
 I got to believe,
at the end of the day,
 he has an
open-minded conscience.
 Oh, are you guys talking about
Bortus's baby's sex change?
 My god, does the whole ship
know about this?
 Yes.
Pretty much.
 Captain, I do not understand
the reason for this conflict.
 Would the gender alteration
procedure harm the infant
 or endanger her life?
 There are different
kinds of harm, Isaac.
 Psychological harm, for one.
 I'd have been pretty pissed off
 if my parents had made
the unilateral decision
 to make me a guy.
 And while it might have saved me
an entire marriage if they had,
 it still would have been wrong.
Oh, thanks.
 You guys don't think that
Bortus and Klyden will love her
 any less than they would
a male baby, do you?
 Well, they'd lose a lot
of friends around here
 really fast if they did.
 Sir, the asteroid
is breaking up.
 The tractor beam can now
alter the path
 of the individual fragments.
 Lieutenant, give them a shove.
 All right, sir.
Shoving beam on.
 Trajectory altered.
 The fragments will no longer
collide with Elnath 4.
 Well, couldn't save a marriage,
but we just saved a planet.
 Captain, we're receiving
 a transmission from Moclus.
 It's from the head
of internal affairs,
 a minister Kaybrak.
 Put him on.
 Channel open.
 Minister Kaybrak,
this is captain ed Mercer.
 What can I do for you?
 Captain, I am informing you
that we are sending a ship
 to rendezvous with the Orville
near the Pleiades cluster.
 A ship?
 We don't have any
rendezvous orders. What for?
 A vessel was requested
by one of your officers.
 We are coming
to take the Moclan female.
 I want you to tell me just what
the hell you think you're doing.
 You want to set up a rendezvous
with another vessel,
 you go through Kelly or me.
 I am sorry, captain,
I had no choice.
 Don't give me that crap, Bortus.
You are a union officer.
 Do you have any idea the kind of
position you're putting me in?
 I am not asking you
to participate, sir.
 Klyden and I will transfer
 the child to the Moclan vessel,
 Orville need not be involved.
 The Orville is involved, Bortus.
 By the very fact
that we are the ones
 transporting the baby.
 What would you
have us do, captain?
 The doctor will not perform
the procedure here,
 so we are left with
no other alternative.
 That baby was born on a
union ship to my second officer.
 Which means that as
long as she is aboard,
 her safety is my responsibility.
 With all due respect, sir,
we do not see it that way.
 And I do not believe
the Moclan ship will, either.
 What does that mean?
 What, are you...
What, are you implying
 this could lead
to a military conflict?
 Bortus, your people
are members of the union.
 Which, by the way,
could be jeopardized
 if the admiralty decides
that this is unethical.
 Do you see the size
of all of this?
 Permission to return
to my station, sir.
 No, you're relieved of duty.
 Thanks.
 Thanks.
 Kelly, we are doing
the right thing here, yeah?
 What do you mean?
 Are you doubting it?
 Let's say you and I had a baby.
 On purpose?
 Yeah, and-and imagine
 that baby was born
with a third leg.
 Like, a whole, full-sized leg?
 Yeah, like a, like
an actual leg, with, like,
 a foot on the end of it
and everything.
 And we had the doctor remove it.
 Now, no one would think twice
about that, right?
 Even though there are species
 in the galaxy with three legs,
 we would be
conforming that child
 to our species' appearance,
 and we wouldn't have
any moral qualms about it.
 Do you actually believe
 that's the same thing
as changing a girl into a boy?
 No, I don't.
 I-I'm just...
I'm just policing myself,
 because we all know
how easy it is
 to judge another
culture's way of life
 just because it's alien to us.
 But you have to balance that
 against some universal code
of ethics.
 I mean, suppose
it was their custom
 to kill all newborn females.
 Should we respect
their culture then?
 The Moclans view
 the female gender as a handicap.
 There's one person on board
who might be able to help.
 You ready?
 I do not understand
the purpose of this.
 The purpose is to get you
to blow off some steam.
 I know you've been upset
 since the captain
suspended you from duty.
 I was unaware that blood sports
were popular on Earth.
 Mm, boxing's been gone
a few centuries now,
 but commander Grayson
taught me the basics,
 and trust me, it's an art form.
 It is my understanding
that striking a fellow officer
 is a court-martial offense.
 Well, I won't tell if you won't.
 Although, a Xelayan female
 versus a Moclan? I'm sure the
crew would love to take bets.
 Here we go.
 Round one, ding, ding.
 What is "ding, ding"?
 Never mind.
 Come on, put your hands up.
 Protect your face.
 That's more like it.
 Okay.
 My turn.
 Not bad for a female, huh?
 I am growing weary
of my shipmates
 imposing their will
upon my family.
 Have you ever stopped to think
that maybe they're right?
 I will decide what is best
for my child!
 Bortus. What happened to you?
 There was an explosion
in engineering. I am fine.
 Why the ice pack?
 Dr. Finn can repair your injury.
 Do you not have somewhere
you need to be?
 You are snippy.
 I am not snippy.
 Very well.
 I'm going to get new clothing
for our trip to Moclus.
 Mind the baby.
 Fine.
 Oh. Sorry, Klyden.
 Hey, yo, Bortus,
mind if we come in?
 Now is not a good time.
 What happened to your head?
 I said go away.
 Listen, we feel really bad about
everything that's been going on,
 so we thought you might
need a little cheering up.
 How about a beer and a movie?
 I am not in the mood.
 Ah, come on.
You're laid up anyway.
 What do you say? A couple of
brews and an old Earth flick.
 Huh?
 Rudolph. Rudolph, please.
 Would you tone it down a bit?
 I mean, that nose of yours.
 I... that nose.
 That beautiful, wonderful nose.
 Huh?
 Rudolph, Christmas is not off.
 What I'm trying to say is,
 Rudolph, with your nose
so bright,
 won't you guide
my sleigh tonight?
 It will be an honor, sir.
 Okay, Rudolph. Full power.
 Up, up, up and away!
 Of course.
 Without Rudolph's nose,
 Santa would not have been able
to complete his voyage.
 Looks like Santa got
pretty lucky, huh?
 Christmas would have been ruined
 if Rudolph
had been euthanized at birth
 as his father wished.
 Yeah, I don't... I don't know
if that was ever on the table.
 What was clearly a deformity
 became a supreme advantage.
 One can never know.
 Please, watch the child for me.
 I must find Klyden.
 Yeah, no-no problem.
 Hey, he just left his baby
with two drunk dudes.
 Reminds me of my dad.
 Ah, I miss him.
 Klyden, we must speak.
- About what?
 I have had cause
to reconsider the...
 We require privacy.
Leave now!
 Wow. Nice day to you, too, dick.
 Klyden...
 I believe we should leave
our baby unaltered.
 What?
 Bortus, you cannot be serious.
 I am.
 We must raise the child
as a female.
 Out of the question.
 Why would you suggest
such a thing?
 Because I have witnessed events
that have opened my eyes.
 We do not know what kind of
future we are taking from her.
 She may be destined
to do great things as a female.
 Impossible.
 Klyden, you must hear
the tale of Rudolph.
 You will rethink your
conviction, I promise you.
 My conviction will not change.
 You cannot be certain of that.
 Indeed, I can.
 How?
Because...
 I was born a female.
 Klyden, how could you
have kept this from me?
 I am your mate.
 When we first met,
I did not know.
 My parents had
the procedure done
 on Moclus soon after I was born.
 And when did you find out?
 When you were assigned
to the USS Clemens
 and I moved on board with you.
 It was my first examination
by a non-Moclan physician.
 The doctor discovered
evidence of the alteration.
 I was unprepared.
 And why did you not
tell me then?
 Because I did not
want to lose you.
 Klyden, I love you.
 That has not changed.
 I am angry because
you withheld this from me.
 You lied.
 I did not believe
it was of consequence.
 That is not the reason,
and you know it.
 Your parents
 made this decision for you.
 You do not know what your life
would have been like.
 I would have been an outcast.
 Do not pretend otherwise.
 Or perhaps you would have
achieved glory
 for guiding Santa Claus
on Christmas Eve.
 What?
 Bortus, the captain says
get your ass up here.
 The Moclan vessel
is approaching.
 As if all this couldn't get
any more complicated.
 I do not see any complication.
 The child will be taken
to Moclus,
 where she will undergo
the corrective procedure.
 Don't start passing out penises
just yet, captain Vorak.
 The parents are in disagreement
about what's best for the child.
 In such an instance,
the Moclan state
 is ethically bound
to side with the parent
 in favor of correcting
the condition.
 "Condition."
 So to you people, being a woman
 is like having chronic diarrhea.
 Look, Kel, I think
we should focus on...
 Hey, doc, I'm not feeling well.
I've had the tits all day.
 Captain Vorak, I will not
allow that child to be taken
 off the Orville
without Bortus's consent.
 Look, I suggest we all
just take a beat here,
 let the admiral sort this out.
 In the meantime, you can
hang out on our ship.
 We have board games.
 We have scrabble.
We have candy land.
 We have monopoly.
 You can be the car.
 Ah, ah, Kel, I'm-I'm
always the car.
 Yeah, but maybe this one
time, since he's our guest.
 You can be the thimble.
 The matter is settled.
 We will depart for Moclus
within the hour,
 and we will take
the child with us.
 I'm sorry, I can't allow that.
 You will stand aside.
 I will not.
Captain, do you require...
 No. Sit down, Bortus.
 You are very fragile,
captain Mercer.
 Are you aware of this?
 There's an antibullying law
named after me.
 Yes, I'm aware of it.
 Captain Vorak,
I formally request tribunal.
 What? Bortus, you cannot.
 It is the only way.
 What's tribunal?
Like, take it to court?
 In a manner of speaking.
 We will be mocked and ridiculed.
 Our shame will be
on display for all.
 Then do not compel our child
to undergo the procedure.
 It is irrelevant.
 No advocate on Moclus
would defend such a thing.
 To my knowledge, the advocate
need not be a Moclan.
 Captain, I request
that you be my advocate.
 Wh... you want me
to be your lawyer?
 Yes.
 No, I won't do it.
 Captain, I beg you.
But Kelly will.
 What?
 You took a year of
interplanetary law
 at union point, right?
Yeah. One year.
 Yeah, that's a year
more than I've had.
 Ed, I don't want
this responsibility.
 I cannot be the one
to determine that child's...
 Commander.
 Please.
 I'll do my best.
 Mercer to bridge.
 Set a course for Moclus.
 Aye, sir.
 Our ship will
accompany you there.
 How do I know you will not flee
with the infant?
 Klyden and I will travel
with you on board your ship.
 We will bring the child.
 Very well.
 Safe travels, Bortus.
 We'll see you soon.
 "Between soul and sacrifice
 beats the heart
of civilization."
 What's that from?
 It is from a novel
by Gondus Elden,
 a Moclan writer of great esteem.
 It is customary
 to respond
with a fitting passage
 from the literature
of one's own planet.
 "I'm a survivor.
 "I'm not gon' give up.
 "I'm not gon' stop.
 I'm-a work harder."
 Those are words of great power.
 Who wrote them?
 I think it was actually
about 15 different people.
 They must be very wise,
these 15 people.
 Well, you should, uh,
probably get going.
 I hate this planet.
 They've completely
industrialized
 the entire surface.
 It's amazing
they can even breathe.
 Oh, my god, they're
under attack.
 Alara, those are testing zones.
 What are you talking about?
 Moclus's primary industry
is weapons manufacture,
 so they're
a little fast and loose
 with their research
and development.
 They test explosives
wherever the hell they want.
 Oh, crap!
 Commander Grayson
to Moclan air control.
 What the hell are you bastards
trying to do?
 Our deepest apologies,
commander.
 That testing zone
was added this morning.
 We neglected to include it
in your flight plan.
 That's great.
Thanks for thinking of us.
 I'm gonna need a pair of pants
brought to the landing site.
 We will have pants waiting for you.
He's kidding.
 No, I'm not.
 Tribunal begins.
 Advocate Kagus,
please begin your inquiry.
 Lieutenant commander Bortus,
 how long have you and Klyden
been mates?
 Six and a half years.
 Tell me about your gomaskah,
 what you humans call
"a first date."
 Klyden and I shared an evening
meal at the dining establishment
 atop the Moclan central arcade.
 We then played combat games
in the environmental simulator.
 Was it a pleasurable experience?
 Yes. Between the two of us,
 Klyden and I shot
 339 simulated combatants.
 Hot date.
 And is it your wish
to deny your offspring
 that same experience?
 No. However...
 Are you aware that by electing
 to forego the gender
correction procedure,
 you are condemning your child
to a life of shame?
 She will forever be alone,
 an object of disgust.
 Never will she experience
 a "first date."
 I have recently come to believe
 that we are unable to make
such predictions with accuracy.
 I feel the decision
should be hers.
 How generous of you.
 However, by the time
 she is old enough to have
developed the sense of self
 necessary to make that decision,
 the childhood damage
will be done.
 In all likelihood,
she will despise you
 for not sparing her the pain
when you had the chance.
 That is a risk
I am willing to take.
 I am not.
 Observers will remain silent.
 My inquiry is complete.
 Advocate Grayson,
begin your inquiry.
 Thank you.
 Request lieutenant Alara Kitan
to the inquiry chair.
 Advocate Kagus,
 why is it so bad
to be born female?
 It is a serious birth defect,
 which severely limits
 biologically, intellectually
and socially.
 Interesting.
 Let's look at the
biological end of it.
 What are the drawbacks?
 Females are weak.
 They do not possess
the physical strength
 necessary for effective
 participation in industrialized
Moclan society.
 Hmm. Okay.
 Arbitrator, would you be so kind
 as to loan me your gavel thingy?
 Thank you.
 Advocate, would you do me
a favor and reshape this cube?
 Impossible.
 Why?
 It is solid titanium.
 All right.
 Alara, would you mind
taking a whack at it?
 The tribunal will note
that this female
 was more than strong enough
to reshape the cube.
 Show me a male in this chamber
who can do the same.
 Irrelevant.
 She is Xelayan.
 All members of their species
 possess elevated
physical strength
 due to a high level of gravity
 on their home world.
 In fact, if there were
a Xelayan male here,
 he could reshape the titanium
 with half as much effort.
 I think the tribunal will Grant
 that since there's
no Xelayan male present,
 that absurd statement
is purely speculative.
 Now, onto your assertion about
male intellectual superiority.
 Lieutenant Malloy, I'm gonna
ask you a few questions
 that one might find on any
basic test of adult knowledge.
 Go for it.
 These are gonna be
kind of hard for you. Sorry.
 It's okay, commander.
 It's for the baby.
 Let's start off with
some Earth history.
 A few hundred years ago,
the continents of Earth
 were divided into separate
nation states
 with individual
sovereign governments.
 What was the capital of
the United States of America?
 Um... pass.
 No, it's-it's not
a pass kind of thing.
 Just give me your closest guess.
 What was the capital
 of the United States of America?
 Nabisco?
 No.
 The moon?
Let's move on.
 What are the four chambers
of the human heart?
 The chamber of secrets,
 the chamber of horrors,
 the chamber of...
 No, no, let me get you halfway.
 There's the left
and the right ventricle
 and the left and the right...
 I would like to switch
to movie trivia.
 Let's try one more.
 In the year 2056,
 which genetic engineer
discovered how to target
 and eradicate
individual cancer cells?
 Doctor...
 Bill Nye the cancer guy?
 Well, my point is made.
 While this male may be
the fleet's best pilot,
 he's also an idiot.
 Sorry, Gordon.
 Totally okay.
 The tribunal must acknowledge
that there is no valid claim
 for gender-based superiority.
 Inquiry complete.
 Dr. Finn,
 it is my understanding
that you refused to perform
 the gender alteration procedure
on the child in question.
 Correct?
That's right.
 No ethical doctor anywhere
would do it.
 Captain Mercer.
 Tell me about your penis.
 Uh... did I miss a segue
of some kind here?
 What?
 Are you, what is the term?
 Circumcised?
 Gosh, you know,
I don't usually discuss that
 till the second date.
 I will rephrase.
 Are there cultures
within the union
 who circumcise their offspring?
 Yes, there are some.
 Doctor, if a member
of one of those
 races asked you to
circumcise their infant,
 would you refuse?
 That's completely different.
 How?
 It is a significant
bodily alteration,
 and the infant has
no say in the matter.
 A circumcision is not
a life-altering scenario.
 And a life-altering scenario
 would be unfair to the child.
 Yes, it would.
 A life-altering scenario,
 such as a child shunned
by Moclan society, planet-wide,
 that would be unfair indeed.
 Thank you, doctor,
you've made my argument for me.
 Mercer to Orville.
 Go ahead, captain.
 Isaac,
initiate a planet-wide scan
 of the Moclan surface using
the following search filter.
 Interesting, captain.
 Yeah. I thought so, too.
 Stand by. Scanning now.
 Scan complete.
 Transmitting data.
 Mercer to Lamarr.
 Lamarr here, sir.
 As inconspicuously as you can,
 grab Alara and meet me
at the shuttle.
 We're taking a trip
to the mountains.
 It's got to be around here
somewhere.
 These are the exact coordinates.
 There's a lot of
thermal interference
 coming from beneath the surface.
 It's hard to get a clear
geographical reading.
 Wait.
 Wait. Yeah, there it is.
Small cavern.
 50 meters up.
Scan for life signs.
 One life sign, captain.
 Coming from inside the cave.
 That's it. Come on.
 Hello?
 Is anyone here?
 Who are you?
 Arbitrator,
 this continued delay
 is unacceptable.
 Advocate Grayson?
 If it please the arbitrator,
 my colleagues are urging me
to withhold closing
 until they return
with their evidence.
 It has been two hours.
 Arbitrator,
 request compulsory adjournment.
 What do you got?
A hot gomaskah tonight?
 Silence!
 Advocate Grayson,
 you leave me little choice.
 This tribunal
 is adjourned.
 Wait.
 Oh, my god.
 What... is this?
 My name is Heveena.
 I wish to enter testimony.
 Absolutely not!
 Arbitrator,
 this... this freak
 is an offense to the tribunal!
 Dude, you have been
a colossal dick
 all friggin' day.
 Shut the hell up.
 Arbitrator, to my knowledge,
 there's no prohibition
against the testimony
 of a Moclan female.
 That is correct.
 When I was born, long ago,
 my parents made the choice
 to allow me to remain female.
 They believed that
to have me altered
 would be an offense to nature.
 So they took me far up
into the mountains
 and built our family a home.
 In seclusion.
 They taught me to think,
 to read, to wonder.
 They taught me to love
the person I was.
 When they passed, I remained.
 I had planned to die up there.
 Undiscovered.
 But that is no longer possible.
 The tribunal must not be allowed
to take from this child
 the gift that I was given!
 So I present myself to you,
 as a woman without regret.
 I am happy.
 A life
 of isolation, in the wilderness,
 cut off from society.
 This is your shining example?
 "The blackest abyss
is a pock in the flesh
 "when one has gazed in solitude
 upon the infinity of self."
 You dare to bastardize the words
of Gondus Elden
 to serve your own purposes?!
 If he were here,
he would spit on you for that!
 Would he?
 Why don't you ask him?
 No...
 I do not believe it.
 Well, look at that.
 Your planet's greatest writer...
Is a female.
 There are many ways to
contribute to society, advocate.
 This was mine.
 Unless there are any objections,
 this tribunal is adjourned.
 The arbitration council is asked
 to give their decision
 within 12 hours.
 Hey. How you doing?
 I am fine.
 Hmm.
 She looks so peaceful.
 She has no idea she's
in the eye of a storm.
 I gave everything
I could out there.
 I hope it was enough.
 I am grateful for what you have
done for me, commander.
 Have you talked to Klyden?
 He still believes she must
undergo the procedure.
 Well, I doubt the
arbitration council does.
 Heveena's testimony
changed everything.
 I wish I had such... confidence.
 But, whatever happens,
 we will love her in every way
we are able.
 You'd stay with Klyden
after all of this?
 I must try.
 He is still my mate.
 And I love him.
 We will now hear
the council's verdict.
 We, the arbitration council of
this honorable tribunal of Moclus,
 do not find sufficient cause for
suspension of the procedure.
 Very well.
 It is the decision
 of this tribunal that the child
 will receive
the corrective alteration.
 Arrangements may be made at
the central medical facility
 before the departure of
the starship Orville.
 This tribunal is adjourned.
 I'm so sorry, Bortus.
 Bortus and Klyden,
 I am pleased to introduce
to you... your son.
 Thank you, doctor.
 Captain, permission to
return to the Orville.
 Of course, Bortus.
 I am... sorry for
all that has happened.
 It was not my intention
to hurt you.
 I just wanted to do
what was right.
 What is important
now is... Topa.
 It is a good name.
 And we must give
him a good life.
 Whoever he becomes.
