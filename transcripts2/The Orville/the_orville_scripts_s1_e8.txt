 ♪ ♪ TY [WHISPERS]: Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. [LOUDLY]: Mommy. Mommy! Mom! Mommy! - All right, I'm up. I'm up. - Can we go now? Oh, slow down, Ty. Give Mommy a second here. Are we gonna get to ride the sky cranes? If you're tall enough, yes. Can I go on the gravity bubbles?

 If you promise not to throw up. That's the cool thing... it just floats away. [CLAIRE CHUCKLES] [GROANS] Is your brother awake? He won't get up. I think he might be dead. All right. [GRUNTS] Come on, dead guy, get up. We're leaving soon. [SNORING] [GROANS] Have you even packed? I told you, I don't want to go to a stupid play planet. You're gonna love it once we get there, trust me. Now, come on, up.

 Bradley's parents are letting him do medieval battle camp in the Simulator. Bradley's parents are alcoholics. Now, come on. Get dressed. It's time to experience reality for a change. Family time. Fresh air. Sunshine. Mwah! Come on! [GROANS] [EXHALES] Mom. Mom. [GROANS] Here you go, Ty. Take this one. [ELECTRONIC WHIRRING, TRILLING] Uh-uh. The game stays here. Oh, Mom, come on! You suck. I'm a mom... it's my job. Now turn it off. I hope you guys packed your umbrellas. It's the rainy season on Arboreus Prime. Well, actually, our hotel's above the clouds. Now, remember, if you need anything at all, Dr. Parley's on duty full-time. We'll be sitting in a dockyard. The only thing we might die from is boredom. - [ELECTRONIC WHIRRING] - TY: Mom said turn it off! Shut up! Any sign of my pilot? Well, that's what I came to tell you. It turns out that I need John to stay and supervise an overhaul of the navigational systems. Oh, well, that's a bummer... I was counting on him to help me ride herd on these two lunatics. MARCUS: Hey, give it back! I'm gonna kill you! Guys! Stop! Don't worry. I got you a replacement. ISAAC: Dr. Finn, I look forward to joining you and your offspring on this recreational outing. It will give me an opportunity to observe human familial dynamics at close range. Crap. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Stop it! Stop it! Hey, what's going on back there? - He's messing with my seat! - Marcus, knock it off. - He keeps farting. - Ty, stop farting. - Ow! - ISAAC: Doctor, are your children always this combative? - Only when they're awake. - TY: Hey! The older, less intelligent one seems to derive pleasure from inflicting damage upon his younger, weaker sibling. - He's a kid. They act up. - TY: Ow! Oh, my God, if I have to come back there one more time, I will lose my mind. Knock it off! ISAAC: On my planet, when a program is not functioning properly, it is deleted. That's always an option. If you wish, I will vaporize them. No! For God's sake, I'm kidding. I have noticed that many other families on the Orville include two parents. Where is your counterpart? I don't have a husband. - Was he destroyed? - No. Did you grow to despise each other, and terminate your coupling? I chose to be a single mother. I always wanted kids, but never found a man I wanted to have them with. Ah. Artificial impregnation. You're getting a tad personal, don't you think? TY: Mom said you couldn't bring that! - Shut up! - Ow! Mom, Marcus pinched me! Oh, my God, cut the crap! I'm not telling you again! I didn't even want to go on this stupid trip anyways. You're the one who made me. Why don't you just get out of my way. Stand back. Your commands have little to no effect on their behavior. Perhaps you should reevaluate your method of controlling them. - MARCUS: Hey! - CLAIRE: Just what I need. Parenting tips from a talking hubcap. You harbor prejudice against artificial life-forms. Only against life-forms that think they're better than everyone else. I am better than everyone else. Oh, and so modest. It was not intended as a boast, merely a statement of fact. My only directive is to study human behavior in the interest of relations between Kaylon and the Union. You want to improve relations? Don't tell a mother how to raise her kids. [RUMBLING] - [ALARM BEEPS] - What was that? - Mom? - [MOCKING]: Mom? Mom? Cut it out! -Well, that is what you sound like. We are experiencing a gravity-shear. It is emanating from an uncharted spatial fold -Don't. - directly ahead. - That doesn't sound good. It would be best to avoid it. I will make a course correction. MARCUS: Wait. No! ♪ ♪ You two sit down right now! You're in big trouble! ISAAC: That is an accurate statement, Doctor. We appear to be caught in the anomaly's gravitational field. Helm control is not responding. Kids, strap in! ISAAC: The field is too strong. Our engines are unable to break free. Everyone okay? Mom, what's happening? ISAAC: The gravity-shear has fractured the hull. Main power is off-line. Where the hell are we? Approximately 1,000 light-years from our previous position. What? The spatial fold has thrown us into uncharted space. So can't we just fly back through or something? The shuttle has been severely damaged. It would not survive another passage. [SHIP CLATTERING] The hull fracture is expanding. We need to set down someplace, fast. There is a planet five million kilometers away with multiple moons, some of which have atmospheres. Well, pick one and go. The third, innermost moon has an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. Not the vacation we had in mind, but at least we can breathe. Take us down. There is a valley beyond the mountains that should be a suitable landing site. It could get a little rough, guys! Hang on! I'm scared. We are venting plasma. I can no longer maintain a stable altitude. Go to the engineering compartment and switch to the emergency reserves. Okay. Mom, can I come with you? No. Stay in your seats. I'll be right back. [YELLS] [YELLS] - Dr. Finn? - [CLAIRE YELLS] Dr. Finn? Aah! This thing is a bitch! Pull the hydraulic release, and it will turn more easily. [GRUNTS] [YELLS] [GRUNTS] I got it! Secure yourself and brace for impact. Mom! -COMPUTER VOICE: Too low terrain. Too low terrain. Too low terrain. Too low terrain. Too low terrain. [SOBBING]: No! No! - Mom! - Too low terrain. Too low terrain. Too low terrain. [WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY] [GASPING, WHEEZING] Isaac to Dr. Finn. - Where's Mom? - [CRYING IN PAIN] Dr. Finn, please respond. - Marcus! - [YELLING] [WHOOSHING] [MARCUS GRUNTING QUIETLY] - Are you damaged? - My leg. [GROANING IN PAIN] [LOW WHIRRING] You have dislocated your knee. Ow! It hurts! - I must repair you. - No! Wait! - [BONE BREAKS] - [SCREAMS] [SCREAM ECHOING] [PANTING] Wow. That feels better. I want Mom! Indeed. We must find your mother. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [BIRDS CHIRPING] I have calculated the most likely trajectory of the shuttle's rear section. It is less than four kilometers away. So you can find Mom? That is my objective. Don't worry, Ty, Mom's alive. - I know it. - At the moment, that is a baseless assumption. Do you know how to use this? What? No. It is a basic energy weapon. Unlock the safety and press the firing mechanism. - Why would I need a gun? - There may be unknown dangers on this world. I will be back. Hey! You can't just leave us here! You are small and feeble. I will move at a faster pace alone. The weapon will increase your chances of survival by 24%. [TRILLING] Dr. Finn? Dr. Finn, are you in the vicinity? [GAME WHOOSHING] I have to pee. Then you'll have to go in the woods. It's dark out there. Then hold it! Can you come with me? All right, fine. Come on. Let's go. [RUSTLING IN BRUSH] I can hold it. Isaac? Isaac? [RUSTLING IN BRUSH] Who's out there? I have a gun! [RUSTLING, LOUD PANTING] Who's out there?! [LOUD PANTING CONTINUES] - [GROWLS] - [TY YELLS] -Ty! - TY: Marcus, help! Marcus! - Ty! Help! [MALE GROANS] [PANTING] What was that thing? Evidently, an indigenous life-form. The danger has passed. You may release me now. ["SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD" BY BARRY MANILOW PLAYING] ♪ We had the right love at the wrong time ♪ Hey, can I get a hyper-gauge? ♪ Guess I always knew inside... ♪ - Here you go. - JOHN: Hey, uh, Steve? You think we could change the music? Something less depressing? You got to get cultured, my friend. Barry Manilow was an underappreciated genius of his time. Then how come I want to throw myself out the airlock? I got to say, watching your corpse drift away to this music would be so peaceful. ♪ I have no right to make you stay... ♪ Oh, God, Manilow was a genius. Oh, Captain, we're just installing the new spatial manifold. - How's it coming? - So far, so good. KELLY [OVER COMM]: Bridge to Captain. - Go ahead. We just got a call from the dock master at Arboreus Prime. Dr. Finn's shuttle never arrived. - Have you tried hailing them? - More than once. - No response. - All right, stand by. Did she say Claire's missing? Yeah. How soon can you guys be done here? Sir, we're still at least two days away - from finishing the upgrade. - Well, it's gonna have to wait. John, report to the bridge, set a course for Dr. Finn's last known coordinates. JOHN: Uh, well, how am I supposed to do that? You see that pile of crap on the floor? That's our navigational array. Well, you're just gonna have to do it the old-fashioned way. Star charts. Oh, great. Do not get us lost, man. ♪ It doesn't matter if you're gone... ♪ [ANIMALS CHITTERING] - It's your fault we crashed. - MARCUS: It is not. You're the one who threw my game at the helm. Well, you shouldn't have brought it anyway. Mom said you couldn't! This conflict is highly distracting. When we find Mom, you're gonna be in so much trouble. You're the one that's in trouble! Cease immediately. You're gonna be grounded for, like, ten years. You're gonna be an old man by the time you come out your room. I am not! You're a liar! Children, cut the crap right now. If I have to come back there one more time, I swear to God I am going to lose my mind. What? Our dysonium power supply is depleted. I will not be able to use the shuttle's scanners to conduct a broader search for Dr. Finn, nor can I send a distress signal to the Orville. [MECHANICAL HUMMING AND CRACKLING] [TY SIGHS] You know, in astrogeology class I learned that there's lots of dysonium in the galaxy. Like, on lots of different planets. Maybe there's some here. Without the shuttle's scanners, I am unable to search beyond the immediate vicinity. Well... maybe just try? - [COMSCANNER CHIRPING] - I am detecting trace amounts of dysonium on the outer-hull. This would indicate the presence of a deposit in the mountains where the shuttle impacted. - So there is dysonium? - Indeed. You are not as intellectually stunted - as I previously believed. - Well, then let's go! -The mountains are some distance away, and your biological systems require a rest period. We will depart in the morning. What if... there's more monsters? That is a risk we must take if we hope to find your mother. [SOFT GROANING] [SOFT PANTING] Hello! Is anyone there?! Where the hell am I?! [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] You must be hungry. Who are you? Where are my children? - Eat. - Where are we? [DOOR CLOSES] It's a safe place. I have to find my kids. We were in a crash, and I don't know what happened to them, so I have to get the hell out of here right now. [GRUNTING] I told you... you're in a safe place. My translator must be broken, because "safe" means something else in my language. Eat. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [PANTING] [WHIMPERING] [ELECTRONIC WHIRRING] - It's my turn to play! - You don't get a turn. - That's not fair! - You're the one that said I shouldn't bring it, so you don't get to play. - You don't get to make the rules. - Yeah, I do. [WHINING]: Isaac! The game is never to be spoken of again. Well, now what am I supposed to do? I'm already bored. Perhaps you can assist me in my study of biological life-forms by explaining the nature of your interactions with your mother. Well, what do you want to know? You seem to hold your mother in contempt. I must conclude that you dislike her. That's not true! -You continuously disrespect her, - and ignore her commands. - Yeah. - You're totally mean to Mom. - No, I'm not! MARCUS' VOICE: I didn't even want to go on this stupid trip anyways. You're the one who made me. How'd you do that? I can synthesize any vocal pattern. What's wrong? Someone is approaching. - Come no closer. - Give us the children. ISAAC: They are under my protection. You may not have them. [LOW GROWLING] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] Are they... dead? No, they are merely stunned. They appear to be suffering from disease and malnutrition. Why did they want us? I would surmise that their intent was to consume you. My hand must remain unencumbered in the event I require its use. Isaac? Just hold his hand. [GRUNTING] [DOOR UNLOCKS] [DOOR OPENS] You haven't eaten. I'm not hungry. Food is scarce. Don't waste it. Eat. Now! My name is Drogen. You are very lucky I found you. I was with three others... my two sons and an artificial being. You were the only one I found in the wreckage. Then I'm sure you'll understand why I need to find them. They're young, they could be hurt. No one survives out there for long. I was carrying a communication device. Did you find it? Please. - Let me call my kids! - It won't matter. - Why? - There was a war. The enemy put Paloxus in the water supply. - Paloxus? - A biological weapon. Millions were killed. A few survived, but they are sick, desperate, violent. Many have resorted to cannibalism because the food is almost gone. You don't look sick. I was one of the few who saw the danger coming. And I stored enough food and clean water, enough to last for a long, long time, and... I have weapons. Look, I'm a doctor. Let me go, and maybe I can find a cure. There is no cure. I'm your only hope for survival. [DOOR CLOSES] MARCUS: What now? We must cross. Come on. [TY SCREAMS] - Ty! - Help me! - [TY COUGHS] - You all right? I think so. [COUGHS] If you are undamaged, then we must keep moving. Come on. The shuttle's ion trail ends directly ahead. Bortus, any sign of the shuttle itself? Negative, Commander, but I am detecting a spatial anomaly of some kind. Let's see it. What is that? -It appears to be a class-two spatial fold. Back at Union Point, we called that a glory hole. You called it a glory hole. Nobody else called it a glory hole. ALARA: Captain, their ion trail leads directly through it. Well, if we're gonna find them, we got to follow them. We have no idea where that thing leads. We could end up inside of a planet, or a star. Most of space is empty, so our odds are good. We're gonna have to chance it. Gordon, take us in. Aye, sir. ♪ ♪ Now entering glory hole. - No, Bortus, it's not... it's... - Sir? It's fine, forget it. [RUMBLING] Outer hull pressure increasing. ED: Steady. Maintain course. Damage report. Multiple hull fractures, nine overloaded power conduits, and Ensign Davis spilled soy sauce on his pants. - He put that in a damage report? - Yes. My God, we got to get better people. Lieutenant, where are we? I don't recognize anything. There's a good chance we're off the charts here. Hail the shuttle. No response. I'm not picking up a distress signal, either. BORTUS: Sir, we have to assume the shuttle suffered worse damage than we did. Maybe they decided to set down somewhere. What's the nearest star system? One Gas Giant with 72 moons. 36 of them are large enough to support atmospheres. How the hell are we supposed to search all that? One world at a time. [ANIMALS CHITTERING] Marcus. You have not consumed your ration bar. Are you unwell? When we were leaving... I told my mom she sucked. That was one of the last things I said to her. It is quite possible your mother is alive. - What makes you say that? - There was no sign of blood or severed limbs in the shuttle. I will replenish the fire. Must be nice not feeling pain. We have a long journey tomorrow. You require sleep. Mom used to tell us bedtime stories before we went to sleep. Can you tell us a story? I will do my best. Please adjust your bodies to a horizontal bearing. Lie down. There was once a doctor and her two children. They embarked on a recreational journey to a leisure planet. Their shuttle was diverted by a spatial anomaly and crashed into a mountain. The children survived with the help of a more advanced artificial life-form. Their mother was missing or dead. The end. Man, I hate that story. Do you know Peter Rabbit? I will search my Earth files. "Once upon a time, there were four little..." Can you do it like Mom? I want Mom's voice. You said you could do that. Ty, that's seriously creepy. Please? CLAIRE'S VOICE: "Once upon a time," "there were four little rabbits," "and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy," "Cotton-tail, and Peter." "They lived with their mother in a sandbank," "underneath the root of a very big fir tree." "'Now, my dears, ' said old Mrs. Rabbit..." "'You may go into the fields," "'or down the lane," "'but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden." "'Your father had an accident there;" "'he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor." "Now run along, and don't get into mischief.'" [BIRDS TWEETING] Good. You are awake. We may resume our journey. Hey, Ty, wake up. It's time to go. Ty, come on, man. I don't feel good. Isaac! ♪ ♪ [EXHALES] Help! Help me! [DOOR OPENS] What happened? I slipped and fell. I cut myself on the bed frame. That was foolish. I'll get a bandage. I need to disinfect it first - with antibiotics. - I have none. - A bandage will do. - There are medical supplies in my shuttle. Look, I know this is a safe place, and I'm grateful to be here, but I don't want to die here. An infection would kill me. And then you'd be alone again. I won't be gone long. Thank you. [DOOR CLOSES] [PANTING] [GROANS] [EXHALES] [GROANS] Oh. [GRUNTS] Oh. CLAIRE [OVER COMM]: Isaac, it's Claire. Can you hear me? Isaac, do you read? - Mom. - Marcus, is that you? This is Isaac. Where are you, Doctor? Isaac, are my boys all right? ISAAC: Your children are alive. - [SIGHS] Thank God. - However, your younger son has fallen ill. My scans indicate he has ingested a water-borne toxin. Send me your coordinates. I'll get there as fast as I can. ISAAC: We are returning to the shuttle with the dysonium we require to restore power. I suggest we rendezvous at the crash site. Okay. Let me talk to Ty. - Mommy? - Hey, baby. I heard you weren't feeling so great. TY: Where are you? Are you coming back soon? Mama got held up, but I'm coming. You just hang on, okay? Hey, Mom? What is it, baby? Mom... I'm... I'm sorry that I didn't want to go on the trip. And I'm sorry I said you suck. I didn't mean it. Marcus. Listen to me. People say things they don't mean when they're angry. You know how sometimes I yell at you and your brother if you do something wrong? Well, you know I still love you with all my heart, right? Uh-huh. And I know you love me right back. So it's all okay. - You understand? - Yeah. I know you love your brother, too. So, right now, I want you to help Isaac take care of him. Do you understand? - Yes, ma'am. - Good. I love you. I love you, too. And I'm gonna see you soon. I have your medicine. [GRUNTING] [SHOUTS] [PANTING] [SNARLING] [PANTING] [TRILLING] [PANTING] ♪ ♪ [SNARLING] [SHOUTS] [PANTING] [HYPODERMIC HISSES] ♪ ♪ [SNARLING] [TRILLING] [PANTING] Mom! Oh, God, oh, baby. Oh, baby, I'm so glad you're okay. Mwah. [PANTING] Dr. Finn, Ty requires your attention. Mommy? Hey, big guy. How's he doing? His body temperature is 5.6 degrees above normal, pulse rate 42 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/45. [TRILLING] [WHIRRING] We have power. I am activating the distress beacon. [SOFT BEEPING] [POWER SHUTS OFF] What happened? The dysonium was not as concentrated as I had believed. There was only enough power to send a brief signal. - Was it enough? - I do not know. How long till the Orville gets here? Assuming they travel through normal space, their arrival could take weeks. If they detected our signal at all. I sequenced a blood sample f-from one of the victims, and I'm... pretty sure I can formulate a cure. But I need... my Med-lab on the Orville in order to do it. [SNIFFLING] Ty doesn't have weeks, damn it. I can't just sit here and watch him die. I can't just sit here and watch him die. ♪ ♪ I will stand watch. [BEEPING] -Captain, I just picked up an EM pulse from one of the innermost moons. It's only a blip, though. Could just be background noise. Gordon, set a course. Anything? Detecting debris on the surface. Bio-signs? ALARA: Affirmative. Three humans and one artificial life-form. Thank God. Gordon, prep a shuttle. - Aye, sir. - BORTUS: Captain, there are two dozen unidentified life-forms approaching them. [TY WHEEZING] He's not breathing right. His airway is closing up. Come on, Ty. Breathe! Breathe! [BRUSH CRUNCHING] [SOFT SNARLING] [SNARLING] [GROWLING] [SHOUTING] Doctor, we are under heavy siege. I cannot repel them alone. [WEAPONS FIRING] I'll go. Wide stance. Make sure you keep it on stun. They may not value life, but we do. [WEAPONS FIRING, SHOUTING IN DISTANCE] [TRILLING] [SHOUTING] You must focus. Try again. Well done. [SHOUTING] MARCUS: There's too many of 'em! [SHOUTING] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [SOFT TRILLING] CLAIRE: It'll take a couple of days for the toxin to leave his system. And he'll probably have nightmares for a while. - But he's okay? - Yeah. Well, notify us when you have a full stock of the cure. I want to get clearance from the admiralty to send a medical team back to that moon. Maybe we can help those poor people. - If they'll let us. - You know, Isaac briefed me on everything that happened down there. But what I'm still missing is your end of the report. Can it wait, Captain? There's something I need to do first. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Isaac. Good morning, Doctor. I thought you'd like to know, Ty's gonna make a full recovery. I am pleased to hear it. He's been asking about you. You think you could drop by sickbay later? For what reason? He misses you. Odd. Very well. I will visit him this evening. Isaac... I wanted to thank you for taking such good care of my kids. They're everything to me. I thank you for the opportunity to observe them. It was quite informative. The boys adore you. I don't know why or how you managed to keep them in line, but... I'm sure as hell glad you did. I simply adjusted my programming to accommodate their sibling dynamics and emotional responses. Your failed attempts at discipline were also instructive. Well, anyway, I'll leave you alone. May I make a final observation? Your children are unruly, disrespectful, volatile, and highly unpredictable. I am quite fond of them. Welcome to the family. synced & corrected by PopcornAWH www.addic7ed.com
