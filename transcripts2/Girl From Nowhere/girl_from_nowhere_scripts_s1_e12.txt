 Finally, the time for departure has come. Everyone is sad about graduating as if everything in their life is about to end and they don't want to start the next phase of their life. Many think that after this, everything will become part of the past. They are good memories that we don't want to forget. However, this might not be the end of it. It might be the start of the discovery of all the ugly truths.

 And a lot of times, the past is not as beautiful as how we remember it. GRADE 12-1 HOMECOMING, 12TH ANNIVERSARY SAKNUSORN 114TH ALUMNI Good evening, everybody. Let me hear a round of applause for Saknusorn 114th Alumni. GRADE 12-1 HOMECOMING SAKNUSORN 114TH ALUMNI TILL DEATH DO US APART Amazing. The sound of the applause was so loud, even people in Chiang Mai could hear it. For those who are thirsty, come here. For those who are hungry, go over there. Restrooms are in the back. Let's jump right into it.

 Okay, everyone. Cheers! -Let's go. -Cheers! Hey, assholes. -What's wrong with you guys? -What the hell? I spilled my drink because of you, jerk. Oh, Thap, you dick. -Fong. Asshole. -Hi. Hi. Why did you call my girlfriend asshole? What? Who would dare to call an angel that? Right, Fong? Wait. You guys still don't have the class shirts. -That's true. -I'll get them for you. Meng, don't. I'll do it. What? -He went just like that? -Yeah. Fong! I haven't seen you in a long time. I missed you. Hey. -How are you? Everything okay? -Yeah. How are you? What about you? Happy? Yeah, you? Have you made up with May? No. She's got someone new. Do you want something to drink? Wow, thank you. Here. For Fong as well. Thanks. Hey. Yes? Hey, you like kids now? No, I don't. Yes, you do. -You wolf. -It's not like that. -Why? -I just have this feeling... What? That she's kind of familiar? Oh, familiar. -Yes. That's right. -Was that the restaurant? -Yes. -Fong, here. What's that? Orange juice. Well, I quit drinking for a while now, but I can still have a toast with you. -Come on. -All right, okay. -Cheers. -Cheers. Oh, jeez! Look who's here. Thap and Fong. The eternal couple. Speaking of the devil, am I right? Okay, let's do it like this. I get it. I don't want to talk too much. Let the photos speak for themselves. Okay, show them. Here. How is it? Look. Two straight faces. This means they're in love with each other. Here, holding a guitar. Normally, he would play the C chord. Once he saw Fong clapping for him, he changed to the love chord. Look. Wow, look at him go. Damn! Very cheesy. Look at him holding her shoulder, showing ownership. He's possessive. Captain Thap is possessive. What the hell, man? As of now, our Fong has quit her promising AE job, and is taking care of Captain Thap 24/7. The moment I knew that, I was so jealous that I cried. Okay, everybody. Raise your glasses. We'll give Thap and Fong our blessing. The strong couple of grade 12-1. Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! You can't compare me with Thap because being a flight attendant is so much more difficult. I have to take care of the guests, serve them drinks, and then I also have to watch out for perverts. PROUD FLIGHT ATTENDANT EX-DRUM MAJOR 3.0 GPA Do you want to sell cosmetics with me? My job is really easy. You just have to stir the cream, give it some pretty packaging, and then you can sell it. Anyone who's free can join me. It's easy. BELL OWNER OF SKIN CARE COMPANY EX-CHEERLEADER 2.8 GPA Wow, I'm so lucky. The reunion of the Angel Gang. WIT ENERGY ENGINEER PRESIDENT OF SAKNUSORN 114TH 3.2 GPA -Let's toast. -Okay.

SHORTY CONTRACTOR ONE WIFE AND ONE KID Cheers! -You guys are so slow. -I can't. Can you remember if our class had 30 or 31 people? I was arguing with Wit earlier. -Shorty, what the hell? -You jerk. -Man, are you drunk already? -Yeah, probably. -I'm not drunk. -Keep talking. Count carefully. -Wit, come on. -Was it 30? -Talk to me when you're done. -You were the class president. How can you forget your friend? He's getting serious all of a sudden. -Come on. -He's always like this. Hey! -I'm sorry. -It's okay. What's your name? Why don't you think about it? Almost drunk. We should toast. -Let's toast. -Let's toast. -Cheers! -You finally got laid! I'm happy for your family, Shorty. Hello, grade 12-1. We're now at the spot where we buried our time capsule 12 years ago. We've been digging for a while, but we still haven't found the chest. Hey, what's that smell? That really stinks. -Whoa, there are worms. -Holy shit! Worms. Gross. -Shit, come on. Hurry. Let's get it... -So many worms. Did you find it? -I got it. -Come here. -Hey, friends. -Yes. Right now, we've got the time capsule box that we buried 12 years ago. -Yeah. -Let's go. It's so fucking exhausting. Right now, we'll carry this into the party and open it together. Wit, you jerk. Why didn't you come and help, asshole? Meng, did you step on shit? Just do it. Come on, let's open it. This key... I've been keeping it safe for 12 years. Judging from your faces... I should open it real quick, right? -Yeah, just open it. -Yeah. I just wanted it to be a bit ceremonial. Shit! -What the fuck? -What is it? It's rusted. -Hurry up. -Smash it. -Smash? -Yeah. Just smash it. Chai, come here and do it. Jeez, don't just stand there flexing your muscles. -All right. -I'll handle it. Hey. So cool. That's my man, Chai. Amazing. -Shit. -Whoa, shit. The smell... It's not worth it. Wow, shit. Look, how is it? Guess whose it is. Hey, it's mine. Thank you so much, everyone, for signing this flag and being here tonight. I'm really grateful. -That was profound. -Yeah. Cool. Yeah! BODYBUILDING This. I don't even have to say who owns this. They even buried this together. See? How disgusting. -Yeah. -Yeah. Okay, I'll have to ask Thap and Fong to come up, and read their love letters for us. Wait. Hold on. That's private. Come on. We're all friends here. -Yeah. -Hurry. Come here. -Yeah. -Come on. -Let's go. -Open it. -Open it. -Open it. -Open it. -All right. Okay. Fuck you. Yeah. No need to be nervous. We're all friends. -Yeah. -Are you thirsty? Yes. It seems like he's thirsty. Hey, you. Get him a drink. Okay, here you go, Captain. Thank you. Read it already. People are waiting. Oh, okay. Yeah. "I promise I won't ever leave Fong. Once I become a pilot, please marry me. Not bad at all. Okay, I'm done. -Is that it? -That's it. Okay, applause. Very nice. Fong, what's wrong? You seem quiet. We can go home first. I don't want our friends to see us like this. About the party... There's no need to worry. You've been like this for almost a week. What's on your mind? What about you? Is there something you want to tell me? Fong, what exactly do you want to say? I don't know. I'm a woman. I have a gut feeling. About what? What did I do? Don't let me catch you red-handed. How many times have we talked about this? Yes, Thap. How many? Just ask yourself. Okay. Captain Thap has already said that much. Now... -Yeah. -In order to make it fair, Angel Fong has to read it, too. What's written on the cover? "Together, we live. Leave me, you're dead." Hey. Let Thap read it himself. -Here. -Okay. "Hi, Thap. I don't know how long it will take until you get to read this letter. I just want to thank you for always taking care of me, and for always forgiving me when I do something wrong. I just want to tell you that if I didn't have you, I don't know how my life would be, and I don't want to know that. So, I've decided to have you here with me forever, and I'll do my best to take care of you. I won't ever let you go. P.S. The sticker on the front, I really mean it. -Damn. -Wow, shit. Amazing. -Here. -Take it. Go sit over there. Stand there. Yeah, go. -Hey. -That was so sweet. Who owns this? Who hasn't gotten their stuff? I heard that this model is really tough and durable. Whose is it? Anyone? Anyone? -Whose is it? -Whose is it? There's an extra item? Wit, you were the class president. I already told you. Our class had 31 people, not 30. Well, fuck you. Think, then. What's the name of the 31st person? I'm starting to remember that our class really had 31 people. Shit, but I just can't remember who it is. Nan. Nan that entered in tenth grade, and left after less than a semester. Nanno, the psycho. GRADE 10-1 Draw the line first. Good morning. My name is Nanno. I'm 16 years old. Today is my first day. Please take care of me. From what I can remember, Nanno enrolled in the middle of the semester, so she didn't have many friends. Yes. And she was always on the phone with her boyfriend. So we tried to befriend her. Yes, Tan. Yes. See you later. Yes. Nanno, let's go for ice cream today. There's a new shop in front of the school. Do you want to go? I'm sorry, but I can't. I already have an appointment. With your boyfriend, right? You're always talking to your boyfriend. Don't you want to spend some time with your friends? Okay, that's all right. Next time then. Maybe you can even bring your boyfriend with you. -Yes. -Okay. Oh, excuse me then. -Happy Valentine's Day. -Pretty roses. -Jerks, don't stick them on me! -Whose are they for? -Hey, you. -Whose are these? Let's go to my house? -Stickers. -Hey, Kai. Kai. -Kai, man. -What the heck are you doing? Not bad at all. Kai. -You want some? -It's all gone. Hey. Amazing. Let's see. "Happy Valentine's Day. From Thap." Wow, this came with the roses. -You guys are disgusting. -That's true. But this bouquet is small, -so he must not love you that much. -Yeah. But Thap is quite biased. He only gave these to his girlfriend. I'm jealous. I want these, too. Come, let's stick some more of these. Someone will give you roses, too. She's blushing. Here. Nanno. -Yes? -Flower delivery. Amazing. It's so big. Tan must love Nanno very much. That's so pretty. If he really loved me, he would have given them to me himself. There's a card. I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY. FORGIVE ME. SEE YOU. It's the same. I want to see what Tan looks like. -He must be really handsome. -Yeah. And... In the card... What did Tan do to make you angry? It's nothing. He just doesn't really have time for me. Despite that, he still calls you a lot though. Stop being mad at him and let us meet him already. Yeah. I want to meet him, too. Your romantic Tan. Once he's free, Nanno should tell him to meet with us, -Right. -so we can finally go somewhere together. I'll try, okay? Your roses are really pretty though. -Yes. -Yes. Fong likes them? Take them. Hey. Tan didn't give them to me. If you give these to someone else, he'll be angry. If Fong doesn't want them... I'll just give them to someone else. Nanno. Nanno promised that she would let us meet Tan, but then the plan would always be interrupted by all those reasons she came up with. In the end, Fong just... Tan can't come here again? I had to wait for nothing again. Will I ever get to meet Tan in this life? I... will go to the bathroom. Okay. Do you think... that this Tan really exists? I agree that something is fishy. Right? Who will keep missing an appointment like this? I think he doesn't want to meet us. I think something is up with this Tan guy. Do you want to prove it? Are you sure? Yeah. I've been curious for quite a while. CONTACTS -Shit. -What is it? There's nothing here. Who the hell did she talk to? -She was always on the phone. -No incoming calls. No outgoing calls either. Do you want to go for ice cream? Tan is busy, but I'm free. What's wrong? Why are you acting weird? No. It's nothing. There's something we need to do. Oh, what a shame. Let's eat some ice cream next time, then. With or without Tan. Sure, Nanno. Sure. Sure. Oh, Tan. Nanno who was always on her phone was actually talking to... the void. I see. Yeah, I think I remember her now. And then what? Nothing much. She was on her phone even more, because no one would talk to her. Why? I don't get it. Why? What? PSYCHO BITCH CRAZY BITCH TALKING TO NOTHING I'M CREEPED OUT WHEN I SEE YOU I FUCKING HATE NANNO FUCK OFF, BITCH TAN DOESN'T EXIST GET THE FUCK OUT And then one day, someone hit her. She looked really awful. I remember that. It was really scary. There was blood everywhere. And then what? I don't know. It seems like she disappeared after that day. And today, we even forgot before we saw that cell phone. Can anyone contact Nanno? -She's still our friend. -Why? Are you going to cure her, Doctor Kai? I'm not a psychiatrist, but I still know something that might be able to help. I wonder how she is right now. She's probably lying in a mental hospital somewhere being a psycho. Let me see it. This is probably not Nanno's since she left in tenth grade. She wasn't there when we buried the time capsule. This is definitely Nanno's cell phone. I remember it. MENU What? -It's still working. -What? Really? -It's been buried for 12 years. -What the fuck? -True. -Someone is definitely playing a prank. -Shit. -Shit. Wit, if you're doing this... Hi, everyone. Do you still remember me? It's Nanno. Nanno. It's me, Nanno. Nanno. It's me, Nanno. Nanno. It's me, Nanno. Nanno. It's me, Nanno. It's me, Nanno. Nanno. It's me, Nanno. It's me, Nanno. Nanno. Nanno? You're Nanno, right? I thought you already forgot. You remember Nanno now? Thap. You missed me, right? I'm back. You... really are Nanno, right? It has only been a while. Have you already forgotten my face? No, it's just that it has been ten years, but you're still as beautiful as ever. Now that I think about it, you guys in grade 12-1 still look the same. So what are you doing right now? I'm still talking to the void like before. But you're this pretty. You probably already have someone. Stop. You're making me blush. But I can't compete with the middle schoolers. Did you know that apart from being a photographer, Meng is also a star? It's Meng. What? -What? -Shit. Okay, let's pause. Think of that as a trailer. If you guys want to see the full version, download it. It will probably take months to watch all of it. Meng, you pervert. No. Don't be mean with your friend, Chai. Chai will have to cut down on the steroids, too. I heard your medals got forfeited. If the association didn't cover it up, you could be in a big trouble. Nanno, what do you want? I see you're having a party, so I definitely can't come empty-handed. That's why I prepared these gifts to surprise you. Like this one. This building looks pretty familiar, right? Wit. Your company built this building, right? 35-STOREY BUILDING COLLAPSED CULPRIT IN CUSTODY Why was the person in the custody not you, Wit? Hiring someone else to go to jail for you has a very severe punishment. If the police find out about this, Wit will face serious consequences. I'm worried about you. Nanno, what do you want? Can we make a deal? Make a deal like what Doctor Kai did with the politicians, right? Their money was used to build a hospital for money laundering. Cool, right? A hospital with no patients, but has a monthly income worth tens of millions. You think you're superior only because of this? You're just a stupid bitch. Isn't that too harsh, Bell? I don't want to be superior. Especially with you, Bell. I don't have the guts to fight you. I heard you're selling skin care products. It was sold out. The sales were so good you opened another brand, selling fake cream. Once a customer called them out, they closed the page. WARNING. FAKE. RUINED FACE. CHEAP BUT FAKE. Guys, don't listen to her. She's a psycho. Just grab her cell phone. -Calm down. -Wit, what the hell? If we all know each other's secret and no one says anything, it'll just end here. Let's see if there's anything else you can do, bitch. Shorty. This violent behavior of yours... You still have it. No wonder. Your wife wants a divorce, and also wants to sue you for your daughter's custody, right? I'm going to win the case. Don't you worry. I'll tell you something. You will never win the case. You'll lose your daughter, too. Shorty's wife is pretty smart. She shouldn't have been dumb enough to marry you. I'll move into my mom's. I'll take my daughter, too. Bitch, I already told you to drop the subject. -Right? -Daddy, don't hurt Mommy. You think you're good, don't you? No. The evidence speaks for itself. -This is worse than mine. -Oh, my god. Hot-headed and abusive. The court won't sympathize with you. Getting to see you guys grow up to have good lives like this makes me really happy. Let's forget about the past. People make mistakes. I'm even everyone's psycho bitch. Just look at it as something funny. Doing this won't benefit you. Yeah. Stop it already. What do you want? Money? Or revenge? One person at a time. If you talk at the same time, I won't be able to understand. But it's weird because when I was at school, not a single person wanted to talk to me. But right now, you're all talking on top of each other. No one wants to talk to you right now, either. Because you're a psycho bitch. Why don't you try talking to the void again? You're not welcome here. Fong. Don't be mean to me. But that's okay. I get it. Fong has depression, right? You even have to take meds. Have you taken your meds today? Nanno, you bitch. An angel won't swear like that. By the way, Fong's outfit today is really as beautiful as an angel's. But it will be more beautiful if you take off your cardigan, showing off your pretty left arm. The prince must protect the angel. How romantic. Right, Tan? Why are you so quiet? Tan, don't you want to talk to me anymore? Sure, Tan. I think something is up with this Tan guy. It's so big. Tan must love Nanno very much. If he really loved me, he would have given them to me himself. Subtitle translation by Danaya Olarikded
