 Light will always shine on the geniuses or the ones who are more special than others. It will never shine on the losers. Our world only has space for the geniuses. What about the ordinary ones? How will they live? The first place award for the Most Outstanding School  goes to Lerdvithi School. I would like to invite the headmaster to give a speech. It's not easy to come up and speak about the same thing over and over again,

 but it's the pride of Lerdvithi School. It has already been eight years. Eight years. This became possible not only with the effort of a particular teacher or a student, but every single one of them who has always been reminded to believe that humans don't have limits. We can go further. We can do better. The word "limit" does not exist. And when all of us believe in the same thing, all goals -can be achieved. -You're finally done.

 You took so long. And this award -is proof of that. -I was pooping. -Sometimes, we-- -All geniuses of our school... His speech is longer than the limit. Don't complain. It's good for us because we don't have class. I'm happy. I haven't washed my hands yet. Oh, my god! That was gross. Do you know what hygiene is? Finally, I would like to share with you the motto of Lerdvithi School. "Even in darkness, real diamonds will shine." Thank you. Why do you always bring me here when we go for a walk? Coming here won't get your name inscribed on the pole or get your hands imprinted. See? Your name is not on the pole because you don't care about anything. It's not on this pole or on that pole. There's nothing. Okay. Why do you have to insult me, too? Well... I... I feel... jealous. They're good at studying and sports. I feel like a loser. Did someone say something to upset you again? Mew, can you put down your phone and eat first? Will you? Just a second, Mom. You're always like this. This is why your grades dropped. Why can't you be like Pang? -She got into medical school already. -I got a 3.5 GPA. I got a silver medal for sports. But they got a 4.0 GPA and gold medals. But you don't have to feel bad because you still have me, who got a 3.3 GPA and a bronze medal. All right. You both like to console yourselves. That's why you don't stand out. In the future, you will both become burdens to society. Didn't you listen to the headmaster? He always says that when you have no limits, you will be unstoppable. Hey, Nanno. Can you come here for a second? All right. Look at Nanno. She just got here two weeks ago, but she has already discovered her special abilities. Nanno, can you encourage them to find their special skills? So they won't turn into parasites that will pull our school down. Sure. Let's go have lunch. I've prepared special dishes for the new genius. -Let's go. -Okay. Okay, bye. "Let's go have lunch. I've prepared special dishes for the new genius." Why did she call her a genius? Look here. "Quantum physics. Buddhism." Physics and Buddhism? Really? It's the same for today. Attention. -Hello. -Hello. Hello, students. I have good news for you. Last week, we already had a genius named Nanno. Today, we have a new genius. This person just won the first prize from the Thai Literature Association that was announced last night. That person is Pui. Pui, can you say something to your friends? Sure. This is the first time I won this prize. I'm very proud of myself. Everyone has their own special skills. Believe in your potential and release it. Go beyond your limit and you can become successful like us. Thank you. Pui, thank you very much for listening to what I said and for improving yourself. Pui. I'll add you to the group chat of the geniuses, okay? Okay. Congratulations, Pui. You finally discovered the genius within you. Thank you very much, Miss Plearn. Let's go have lunch. Sure. MISS PIYARAT SAELIM 1ST PLACE, THAI LITERATURE ASSOCIATION Why are your hands dirty, Mew? I've done it before. What did you do? Put my hands on someone else's imprint. I did it on my first day here. Hey. Don't you think it's weird that Pui can suddenly write a good novel within a week? Do you want to know the secret? What secret? For something like this, if you want to know, you have to... Tell me, Nanno. Okay, I'll tell you. If you want to become a genius, all you have to do is go to Google, press Control-C and Control-V. That's it. Wait. Are you saying that Pui was able to write a novel because she copied it from Google? Isn't it too harsh to say she copied? If you ask Pui, she would say that she got inspiration from it. It's the inspiration taken from Google that was just modified a little bit here and there. Then, your physics skill is from... Hey. Look at the cheerleaders over there. Do you think they came up with their own moves? Also, for film remakes, how are they originals? For music notes, there are only seven of them. They just recycle the notes. Hey. For Miss Plearn's art assignment, you should try it. What if I get caught? No one caught me and Pui. If you get caught, you won't be called a genius. SEARCH Here. Nanno. It's very beautiful, Mew. Hey, you can print and sell it. Your family owns a printing shop anyway. Mew, you haven't finished your artwork yet? She finished it. It's very beautiful, Miss Plearn. If you're done, then submit it. Well... Your friend said it's beautiful, so I want to see it now. Come quickly. -Miss, I... -Let me see it. Please tell me that you did this yourself. -Well... -It's very good. You can enter the Siam Arts Competition with this. Look at this, students. I will submit this to represent our school in the competition. I believe in you, and I hope that the other students can learn from you. That's awesome, Mew. THE FIRST STEP TO SUCCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRIZE, SIAM ARTS. MISS NICHANART SITTHIBAWORNCHOT YOUTH WINNER OF SIAM ARTS Mew. I'm very happy that our school finally has an art genius. We have one for sports, academics, and music. We only lacked in this area. You really helped the school overcome its shortcoming. If so, then I'm happy. Let's go have lunch. Sure. Mew. Congratulations. Are you still mad at me? Yeah. Since we're both geniuses now, can we be friends again? A genius who copied other people's work? I'm sorry. I don't think I can be at the same level as you. Mew. Mew. EVERYONE, I ADDED MEW TO THE GROUP. HELLO, MEW. HELLO. HELLO, EVERYONE. MISS PLEARN BOUGHT ME A MEAL. SHE TREATED YOU BETTER THAN ME. YOU HAVE A LOT OF FOLLOWERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IF I WERE AS GOOD AS YOU, I WOULDN'T HAVE KEPT IT A SECRET. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN PRACTICING, RIGHT? YEAH. YOUR NEXT PAINTING MUST BE AWESOME. THAT'S FOR SURE. I WANT TO SEE THE NEXT ONE ALREADY. IT TAKES TIME. JUST A DRAFT IS FINE. I WANT TO SEE IT TONIGHT. Mom, why didn't you knock on the door? I just brought you soy milk. There you go. Drink it now. You know what? Ever since you won the award from Siam Arts, your dad has been praising you every day. He praises you for this and that every day and all day. It's because you are cute and talented. -Hey, Mom! -I'm leaving. -What was that for? -Finish the soy milk. Get out. WE BECOME SUCCESSFUL WHEN WE DO THINGS WE THOUGHT WE COULDN'T. INSPIRATION COMES FROM WITHIN OURSELVES. NEVER BELIEVE THAT HUMANS HAVE LIMITS. I DREW THIS WITH MY LEFT HAND. Hey. I really like your artwork, Mew. Your artwork is very advanced. They reminded me of artists like Jackson Pollock. I've been admiring your artwork for a long time. You finally became a genius, too. Beautiful trees are in the forest. The wide sky is full of stars. The star of art is you. The art circles will be developed further. There would be something interesting for people to see. An artist? MEW, THE ART GENIUS I'm not sure about that. Salvador Dali once said, "A true artist isn't someone who needs inspiration, but someone who inspires other people." Well... I'm not sure if I can call myself an artist yet. But if there are people who started to draw and create works of art because of me, I think that's when I can call myself an artist. As I said before, "Even in darkness, real diamonds will shine." Yes. Yes. Yes, our school will organize an open house event to showcase the works of our genius students. The headmaster has decided that it will happen next week. We would like to ask all geniuses to prepare for this event. For Mew, I'm very proud of you for winning the first prize from Siam Arts. I'll let you display and present your work onstage. Miss Plearn, the presentation will be repetitive. Wouldn't that be too boring? That's what I thought, too. Then... Mew should create an artwork onstage. Well, Miss Plearn, I don't think anybody would want to see it. I want to see it. Yeah, I want to see it, too. -Me, too. -Me, too. See? Everyone wants to see it. If we advertise it like this, I'm sure that everyone would want to see it. I will invite Siam Arts Association, reporters, students from other schools, and the association that ranks schools. When the association sees it, we might win for the second time. I think we should broadcast it live, too. Yes. Let's do a live broadcast through the school's Facebook page so that the whole world can watch. Oh, my god, Mew. You'll become famous in our country. Nanno! Hey. Why did you do that? -You know that... -What are you scared of? You are a genius now. That's bullshit. You did it on purpose. What did I do? You don't know? You... Why did you mess with me? Why don't you mess with Pui instead? Mew, I didn't get anyone in trouble. Weren't you the one who wanted to be a genius and become famous? I just helped you. What did I do wrong? -You-- -Don't blame me. Do you fucking realize what you've done to me? Mew, good luck. Fuck you! Mew, I brought you some food. I don't want it! Hello, Mew. Are you creating an artwork? Hey, did you see that post on Facebook? Someone said that you copied their friend's artwork, but I don't know what happened to the post. Are you out of your mind? Mew... Don't be mean to me. I'm your fan. I'll be waiting for your next artwork. You'll be waiting, right? Sure. Pui. I need your help. Can we be friends again? Pui. You're not mad at me anymore? Yeah. Actually, I wasn't mad at you. I was jealous of you. I was jealous because you became a genius. I was jealous because you have your own piece of work and fame. You also have a lot of admirers... while I was still the same stupid person. Hey, that was a long time ago. Can we be friends again? Sure. But I need your help with something. Sure. What is it? Can you hit my arm? Hey, this is not funny. I can't draw. I can't go onstage. I copied other people's work. Please help me. -Please hit me! -Hey! Hit me! -Hey! -Hit me! -Mew, calm down. -No, hit me! I told you to hit me. Hit me. You said you would help me with everything. -Are you breaking your word? -No. This is not what I promised. I'm begging you. I've helped you with many things. Can you help me? I'm begging you. Hit me. -Hit me! Just hit me! -I can't... Just hit me! Can't you just help me with this? I'm begging you. I've never asked you for anything before. Hit me. Just hit me. Hit me! You're not going to hit me? I'll do it myself then. Mew! That's enough! Stop it! Mew, what the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you? Mew. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why did you do this to me? You were the one who hit me. Why did you hit me? -Hey, I didn't do anything. -You hit me. I didn't do it. You were the one who hit me. Why did you hit me? Mew. Help me! Mew. It hurts. It hurts! Help me! -Mew! -Mew! -What's this? -What happened? -Pui hit me. -Why did you do this, Pui? What were you thinking? You hurt her. -Why did you do this, Pui? Why? -I feel sorry for you, Mew. Why did you do this to me? -Mew. -Careful. Are you okay? It hurts. Mew, are you okay? What a shame. I wanted to see you create an artwork onstage. But this happened. Now I have to sit here and treat your wound instead. Your dad was going to close the shop to watch you. He also invited your grandma and aunties. Luckily, I stopped them in time, or they might have gone for nothing. Yeah, I feel sorry about it, too. By the way, what happened? How did you and Pui end up fighting with each other? You've been friends since childhood, right? I'll get it. -Oh, Hello, Miss Plearn. -Hello. Please come in. Mew, your teacher and friends came to see you. Is your hand getting better? Not yet. Don't worry. The school punished Pui by not letting her display her work. If she didn't win any award, we would have expelled her. Pui was so violent towards you. We didn't know that she would be like that. How are you? Can you move your fingers a little bit? Can you try to move them? You might still be able to go onstage. I can't. It still hurts. You already went to see the doctor. Your hand is still not better? My arm is still like this. How can it get better? Lerdvithi School's open house will definitely fail. Do you remember what the headmaster always says, Mew? "Even in darkness, real diamonds will shine." If I were you, I would go onstage. I wouldn't let the school lose its reputation. But if I go onstage and don't do well, it will ruin our school's reputation even more. But you can still use your left arm, right? You posted it on Instagram before. Right? I'll look it up for you. Can I borrow your phone? I DREW THIS WITH MY LEFT HAND. So, you can go onstage then. Congrats, Mew. You can show your special skills now. Not a sound from people can be heard. The leaves drift and the birds sing. We hear the sound of hidden corruption. Thank you. Hello, everyone. The next performance must be what everyone has been waiting for the whole day. It's time for the spotlight to shine on the recent genius of Lerdvithi School. She's the art genius. It's Miss Nichanart Sitthibawornchot or Mew. -Miss, I don't-- -Are you ready? I know you are. You have to go onstage right now. I believe in you. Mew. -Miss... -Mew. You are my genius. Mew is considered as an art genius because she can create amazing works of art in just a short period of time. And even though she was in an accident, that couldn't stop her from performing onstage. Today, everyone will see how Mei will do it. Prepare your cell phones. We will be doing a live broadcast. The whole world will see this art genius, a living legend. Mew, go, go! Mew, go, go! Mew, go, go! Mew, go, go! Mew, go, go! Mew, go, go! Mew, go, go! You thief! You stole my Indonesian friend's artwork! That's nonsense! It's not nonsense. She really stole my friend's work. Here. Where is it? The artwork you all praised and said, "Wow, it's very good." She just stole someone else's artwork and splashed colors on it. Isn't it true? I didn't... The evidence is right in front of your eyes. Tell them. Tell them you think this school is stupid. The Siam Arts Association is also stupid enough to get fooled by you. Look at it carefully. You can lie to others, but you can't lie to yourself. Can I see it? It doesn't look like Mew's artwork at all. Which school are you from? "DWY." Dwy. It's Denwittaya School. I see. It's the rival school that is always in second place. The school that follows our every move. Whether we go to the left or the right, your school follows our every step. This has nothing to do with my school. Of course it does. You want to destroy our reputation, so you are accusing our student like this. I'm telling you the truth. Are you really telling the truth? How well do you know art? How could you accuse our student like this? Confess. If you don't confess, draw us a picture instead. Create an artwork just like this one. Do it! So they will see what is real and what is fake. Do it, Mew. Do it so that she stops talking nonsense. Do it, Mew. Mew, do it. Do it. Do it. -Do it. -Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it... You see? It's exactly the same. It looks exactly like the one she drew. This is the real genius. Her artwork is gentle but powerful. This is a real work of art. It's impossible that Lerdvithi School and Siam Arts Association would praise a fake artwork or a fake person. Are you crazy? They don't look the same at all! You are the crazy one. Why can't you see that they look the same? Why can't you see that Mew is a genius? Because they're not the same. -They're not the same. Look! -Stop. Stop accusing Mew, Siam Arts Association, and Lerdvithi School already. I'm not accusing anyone. I'm telling the truth. The truth is that you are from Denwittaya School, the forever-second-place school. You just want to discredit Lerdvithi School and Siam Arts Association. Get out now. Guard. Stop. I can walk by myself. Are you blaming me for discrediting you? -What are you booing at? -Get out! You are all stupid! You can't even tell what art is! Get out! What is wrong with you? She was so rude that it was obvious she's from that second-rate school. You must have been shocked by this crazy situation. Don't worry. She's just jealous. You are already a genius. No one can destroy you. I'm really proud of you, Mew. You are a role model for the students of Lerdvithi School, and an example of the geniuses. You are living up to the motto of Lerdvithi School. "Even in darkness, real diamonds will shine." Yes. Now that everything has settled down, let's listen to Mew's speech that might inspire all of us today. "Thank you, everyone, for supporting me, standing by me, and believing in who I am. I really appreciate that everyone has gathered here today to fight for me. I believe that what we fought for today will be a good example for the... It will be a good example for the society to learn about love and unity. This would make our society stable in the future to come under the leadership of the geniuses of Lerdvithi School. Finally, I would like to end this speech with the motto of Lerdvithi School. 'Even in darkness, real diamonds will shine.'" I wish you happiness in this world, Mew. Subtitle translation by Tanida Itthiwat
