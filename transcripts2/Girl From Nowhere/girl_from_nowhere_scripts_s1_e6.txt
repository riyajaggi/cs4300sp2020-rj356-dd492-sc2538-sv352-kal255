 Fuck, man. Hey, O. Love? Hey, Bam. Why did you only give O one? What about us? Yours are over there. O, here's your energy drink. We only get plain water. What kind of manager are you? You're so biased. I'm not. It's only because he deserves it. You didn't score one goal today, Teng. -Hey! -Bam? -What? -I'm the goalkeeper.

 How do you expect me to score? And, Bam, I scored one last time, and you didn't give me anything. Really? I must have forgotten. What? -Hey, O. -She never gives us anything. Can we go out for ice cream later? My treat, to celebrate your victory. Please? I'm sorry, Bam. I have to meet up with my mom today. That's fine. Will you please tell her I said hi? Of course. Thank you. Mommy's boy. -Hey, Por. -Yes? I love my mom, too. How nosey. Por, when do you think Mr. Vinai is bringing in the new manager? -There's a new one? -Yes. They say the new one is superb, and doesn't have favorites. I don't think we need a superb one. Just a regular one would still be better than Bam. They should hurry up. I'm sick and tired of her. -That's true. -Are you talking about me? Hey, guys. Here's the new manager. -Hello. -Hello. I'm Nanno. Right. Bam, take care of Nanno. She's new. She's in the same year as you. I'm in a different class. Sir. If you keep staring, your eyes will drop out. -How was the game? -Good. We are doing well. A human's greatest driving force... is hatred. Hey. -What? -What's wrong? -Nanno, dear. -Yes? I heard that you were the manager of your previous school's team. That's right. What kind of manager are you? The scary, encouragement-shouting kind, or the loving, caring kind? I'm fine with anything, as long as she's unbiased. Teng. Do you want to fucking go? I'm really imposing. It's my first day and you're paying for my meal. I should be the one who pays for yours. It's our duty. It's... We just want to give you a warm welcome, okay? -O, we have to welcome her, right? -Right. What time are you going to meet your mom? What mom? I don't have one. Teng doesn't have one, too. -Here's your ice cream, Nanno. -Thank you. -It has jelly, too. -I chose it myself. Is it good, Nanno? It is. O, pass it here. Pass it to me. Keep it up, everyone! Hey, O! O, pass it. Go on! Pass it to me. -Hey! -Hey! Go, go! Yes! When you're done with the balls, go and pick up the cups. Sure. And don't forget the towels over there. Hurry up. Okay, no problem. And the basket over there. Can you carry that by yourself? Yes. Bam, she's just arrived, and you're being so hard on her. Well, I have to train her. Here, let me help. The hallway to the storeroom is dark. -The light bulb has gone out. -Thank you. -Hey, O. -Oh, my gosh. Here you go. Let me take it. That's okay. It's not far. Thank you. I'M BORED NANNO, YOU STINKFACE BITCH NANNO, YOU STINKFACE BITCH LOVE KICK EP 1: THE BEGINNING BY BAMOH COMMENTS THIS IS SUPER FUN. SUBSCRIBED. LOVE IT. WHEN'S THE NEXT EPISODE? MY HEART'S POUNDING. I'M BLUSHING. What do you want? Nothing. Can't I have a look? You're so nosey. Why do you still write it down before you type it? Are you a Neanderthal? Neanderthals didn't have paper. You always argue with me. Anyway, the episode you posted last week got a lot of compliments. There's one comment that I really like. It says... "Blah, blah, blah." Stop it. Why? Does it hurt? I'M IN EUPHORIA. I LOVE IT. WRITE MORE. "THE VOICE THAT UNDID HER." AWESOME. Today, O scored a goal. He's so good. He's so talented and kind. He's such a cutie. When he turned to look at his fans, my palms were sweating. But then a new girl arrived. Her name is Nanno. What an irritating bitch. She's going to be my co-manager. What an annoying chatterbox. So, I wrote shit about her on the bathroom wall, and she saw it. That was satisfying. I hope she transfers soon. I can't stand her. She acts like she's so pretty. Teng and Por kept staring at her. Go and fuck them both, will you? BAM, THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE TOWEL. PLEASE HELP NANNO SETTLE IN. SHE TOLD ME SHE WANTS TO LEARN. TAKE CARE OF HER. Hey, you dropped one. Oh, no. Oh, my. Go and wash them right now. They really stink. Of course. Come here. I'll help. -Hey, O. -Hey. Hey. Thank you so much, Bam. They are clean. -Hey, Por. -What? Help the defender after passing the ball. I'm a winger. I have to be at the front. The goalkeeper and I can't take them all by ourselves. -Tell the other defenders. -Just listen to me next time. What the hell? Bam, did you take a shit in here? Why does it stink so bad? Screw you. It's not me. Are you saying that Nanno farted? No, I didn't. See? Nanno would never do something like that. Bam. You're jealous because she just transferred and we already prefer her over you, right? You're like the evil stepmother. Think what you want. Hey, O. Nanno, can I have some water? Sure. Bring the water and let's get out of here before we reek of shit. Here, O. -Nanno. -Yes? You'll have to excuse me. Why? Bam, what's wrong with everybody? Tell me, Bam. Everyone! The stench... Is it... coming from my face? I'm so sorry. NANNO, YOU STINKFACE BITCH I think you should try something. Bam? Cosmetics, face wash, perfume. There are a lot to choose from. It might stop your face from stinking. Quickly. But I don't know which one to choose. I could just buy everything. Would you like some, too? O LOVES BAM VERY MUCH Please let this be. O, SATTAWAT PHUPHA GRADE 12 CLASS 2 FOOTBALL PLAYER NO. 7 BAM, WIPHADA CHEUNCHOM GRADE 10 CLASS 3 FOOTBALL TEAM MANAGER Bam, someone's here to see you. Who? Is it O? It's Mr. Vinai. Bam. -Bam? -Yes? How's the new manager? Is she doing a good job? She's okay. Good. At first, I thought you wouldn't get along. But if she can help, it's fine by me. Right. And, Bam. -Bam. -Yes? Please be more careful with food. I heard you all got sick this morning. What did you eat? Pass it here. I don't know. Well, take care of it. -That's it. -I'm not going in to get it. Not so hard, you'll hit somebody. Are you all right? I'm fine. I wasn't asking you. I was asking him. I'm all right. Thanks, O. Teng, be careful. Watch where you're kicking the ball. If it hits anyone, it not just you that gets scolded. Both of us will get it. -Come and apologize, now. -You idiot, Teng. -What an idiot. -I'm sorry, Sir. -Haven't you had enough practice? -We have, sir. Do you want to stay for more? -No thanks, sir. -Just a bit more, for fun. -We were just having fun. -Just playing around. Let me walk you to the staff room, sir. -Fine. -Let's go. Hey, Bam. You didn't get hit, right? -Why? -Your nose. Hey. Don't tell me you thought O was protecting you. I see. Your heart is beating so hard and you got a nosebleed just because a guy got close to you. How is that even possible, Bam? Who the hell would want to protect you? Let me be blunt. If a ball was going to hit either you or a dog, I would jump right in front of the dog. Don't give me that look. It really doesn't suit you. Usually, I would say it's cute when a girl gives a sideways glance. But on your face, I think it's horrible. -Teng. -What? What? Is your heart pounding for me, too, Bam? Hey. I must have gotten more handsome lately. TENG IS A DOG -Hey, Teng. -Teng, what the fuck is wrong? -Teng, what's wrong? -He has lost his mind. What the hell? Teng, stop it. Teng, snap out of it. What the fuck? Hey. Snap out of it! What are you doing? You are here to practice. -Something's wrong with him. -Something happened to Teng. What's wrong? Hey, hey! Get him! What the fuck is wrong with you? Get it together, Teng. -Teng. -Teng. Teng. They said he's like a dog. -Please take care of him. -Of course. Take care of him. Bam, what's wrong with Teng? Why is he acting like a dog? Is he going to recover in time for the national competition? Don't worry, Nanno. I'm sorry. NANNO IS A DOG You can put away your plate, Bam. No, I'm staying here. O LOVES BAM VERY MUCH What are you doing? Nothing, I'm testing my pens. Right. That's some serious testing. You're testing every single one. How about some serious tidying, washing up, and sweeping? No way. You've got it bad. Let me have a look. Hey. I thought you were doing calligraphy. Are you putting spells on people? That's my business. BAM, CAN WE TALK? OF COURSE. I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK YOU. ABOUT WHAT? WILL YOU BE MY GIRLFRIEND? IT'S ABOUT NANNO. If only the things I write in my diary came true like the writing on the wall, I'll be the female version of Light, a character from Death Note. I'll write the names of all the jerks and get rid of them. Hello, Mom? I'm going to stop by. I'm going to help your sister pack up and move. Okay. Mom, she never said anything about moving. What? She told me months ago. I thought she would have told you. Really? Whatever. Where are your manners? Don't talk to me like that. I'm sorry. I'm going to bed, Mom. I'm tired. I'll see you tomorrow. NANNO, YOU STINKFACE BITCH TENG IS A DOG Come here, bitch. This is for giving us the wrong answers to the homework. And this one is for doing Poj's homework. He got the right answers, but you gave us bullshit. Poj paid me. You didn't. Do you want some payment? Here. No. Next time, don't be a such a smart-ass. If one word of my homework is different from yours, what you'll get is worse than this. I saw everything. Hey. If you really hate someone, you could try writing on the wall. I think it's a good way to let off steam. And sometimes, the things you write... come true. Like God's listening to your prayers. On the walls in here? Try it. Fine. This place is for learning, not for catfights. Kids these days. If you have so much time, open a book or something. You, too? It's time for class, and you're here chitchatting. Hiding here all day, wasting whole periods. What's wrong with these kids? Hey, O. Hey, O. Hey, O. Hey, O. Hey, O. Here you go. -The cold one is for Por. -Thank you. Hey, you stink. Why are you even here? You made everyone sick last time. What are you talking about? She doesn't stink. See? She smells great. Are you tired? -Exhausted. -Yes. -Hey. -Teng. -What the hell? -Hello there. Are you all better? Yes, I don't know what happened. You're not barking anymore, are you'? -Here, have some water. -Okay. Woof, woof. -Woof, woof. -Woof, woof. -Do you expect me to be a dog forever? -Don't try to bite me again today. I won't. Hey! -Teng. -Let me lick your face. Stop it, asshole. That's enough. What are you doing? You know about it, don't you? Is that why? Don't clean it off! Did Good tell you about it? So it was you who wrote this? And who's Good? Who else has been writing? Don't act like you don't know. Why are you cleaning it off? I have to. It's my job. They pay me to clean things up. What do you expect me to do? Give that to me. Get out of here. You have to stop. Stop it. Please don't clean it off. -Stop. -What? I'll get reprimanded if I don't. You won't. -How do you know? -Well... Just stop. I'll tell you a secret. If you write about someone, like wishing they would shut up, they will. The wall is enchanted. You get what you write. I haven't told anyone except you. How does this sound? If you don't clean it, I'll let you write something. Do you think that I would fall for your childish rubbish just because I'm a cleaner? You can't fool me. Now I know that you wrote this. I can tell your teacher. Is this what I get for meaning well? Meaning well, my foot! Nobody's stupid enough to believe that nonsense. If you want to fool someone, try using what you learn in class. Use your brain. Writings on the wall come true? Everybody would have STDs by now. Did you randomly get selected to study here? Your parents sent you here to learn. You could try learning some manners, too. One of the students from your club, the small, short-haired one, has no manners. She wrote all over the bathroom wall. It's covered in ink. She also wouldn't let me clean it off. She also raised her voice to me. I'll make sure she is dealt with accordingly. Bam. Sir? Don't do it again. I won't. I'm sorry. I appointed you as manager because I believe that you are a good leader. But most importantly, I trusted you. Yes, sir. Do you understand me? Yes. Go and apologize to the cleaner. She's still around. Go. Yes, sir. Writings on the wall come true? Did you randomly get selected to study here? NOSEY CLEANER BITCH I HOPE YOU SUFFOCATE AND DIE I saw your writing on the wall. Is it really enchanted?
