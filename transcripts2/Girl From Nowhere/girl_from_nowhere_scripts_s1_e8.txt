 A particular object's value is never the same as another object's. Value is not only based on the price, but also on a person's fondness for it... Can I see this one? This one? You have a good eye. Its details... Neil Armstrong wore it to the moon. And the story behind it. It first came out in 1969.

 It wasn't expensive then. It is now, though. The price keeps going up. Thank you. I can give you a discount if you like it. You have a good eye. I'll come back to look at it later. But every object will have the same value once stolen. Is he not coming? My boss has some business abroad. He sent me on his behalf. This is TK, his son. -Hello. -Hello.

 He was expelled for stealing. KEMAWITTAYANUSORN SCHOOL It's hard to believe. Some of the reports were exaggerated. We don't accept troublesome students, because we don't want any trouble in our school. It causes a lot of problems. He is well aware of that, so he asked me to give you this. The school's maintenance fee. NARUECHIT LAORSRI FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BAHT -Still-- -And this... is for you, Director. One million baht. Please tell him that our school is very honored that he has entrusted his son to us. Certainly. You can go to class now, TK. Please excuse me. The survey that we conducted examined the time taken to travel from home to school, for this class and the class next-door. We saw that each student took a different amount of time. -Excuse me, ma'am. -Yes. Everyone, a new student will be joining us today. I'll let her introduce herself. Hello. I'm Nanno. Nice to meet you. Okay. You can sit in that empty seat over there. Okay. All right. Let's continue with the lesson. We saw that each person took a different amount of time, right? Some took five minutes. Some took ten. Some took half an hour, and some took an hour and a half. Hey. Why is that guy... He's a problem child. His name is TK. He started here just before you did. Rumor has it that he was expelled from his last school for stealing. Isn't that scary? Really? He doesn't look scary at all. I don't know. The only thing I know is that thieves are terrible. -Nid. -Yes? Please take Nanno to lunch with you. Sure. Nanno, have you seen my eraser? I bought this for you. Take it. Did you buy or steal it? Listen. You are a very interesting person. How come? Are you afraid that I'll tell others that you're a thief, too? Come on. Why would I be afraid? No one would believe a word you say anyway. Hey. Do you want to go to the moon? No. I just like that watch. Let me tell you something. Your method of stealing is old-fashioned and very risky. No wonder there are weird rumors going around. Are you better than me? Do you want to know what I just stole? How would I know? This. KEMAWITTAYANUSORN SCHOOL It's more fun than I thought, stealing from the school. Shall we have a competition? Today, we will look at the results from the exam you just took, and see whether... You're good. Do you believe me now? Have you ever been caught? No. I'm always careful. How about you? Never. Liar. You're really not cautious enough. But I can run fast. Stop right there, thieves! Come back here! Nanno. Do you believe that I'm fast now? Yes. Oh, no. SHALL WE GO AGAIN TODAY? SURE. BUT NO MORE RUNNING. IT'S TIRING. CALL ME MASTER AND I'LL TEACH YOU. YOU ARE ALL TALK. -YOU FOX! -AND YOU SUCK. -GHOST FACE. -LET'S TRY SOMETHING HARDER. Listen up. I will give you guys some homework. Even though the director is nasty, you have to admit that he has good taste. There are security cameras everywhere. You know that everyone and everything has a weakness, right? Look. Look at the footage from the security cameras here. How did you do that? I just put in the password. -How do you know the password? -Listen. Magicians never reveal their secrets. Here. That camera only covers up to here. And this camera only goes to somewhere over there. Therefore, the blind spot is... It's unbelievable that the director paid hundreds of thousands for this painting in an auction. People pay more attention to quantity than detail. You gave him so many flowers. Announcement. A painting has been stolen from the art exhibition. Teachers, please check your students' belongings immediately. All right, everyone. Put your bags and your hands on the table. It was you, wasn't it? Helping your friend hide something is an offense. Isn't it beautiful? No. I hate flowers. What sort of stuff do you steal? Does this camera still work? Doesn't this cat belong to the antique store's owner? It's my cat now. These glasses... Audrey Hepburn wore them in Breakfast at Tiffany's. I got that one from a music store in Europe. Don't tell me that it's Charlie Chaplin's hat. This is limited edition. It goes on eBay for tens of thousands of baht. Amazing. How about this diamond? That belonged to the wife of the director at my last school. Do you have a warehouse for your stolen goods? Yes. I stole that warehouse, too. I'm kidding. How about you? Where do you keep the stuff you steal? Isn't anybody home? You have a lot as well. You're something special. Oh, please. Your things fill a warehouse. Who is this? My father. Is he... He's alive. But... he might as well be dead. We don't really see each other. By the way, why do you steal? No reason. It's fun. I like to win. Do you steal anything in particular? No. I go for the things that people say are hard to steal. How about you? I do it for fun. Liar. In order to become a better thief, you must be a better liar. What do you mean? Nanno. Everyone is saying it was a genius thief who stole the painting. How was it genius? I only looked for the blind spot of the cameras. Thank you so much. For what? For being my friend. Friend? Yes. I've... never had a friend before. I had no one at all actually. To be honest... Can you do me a favor? Can you not disappear on me? What makes you think that I will disappear? I... I don't know. I just have a feeling that you will disappear once you've had your fun or once you are satisfied. I really like being with you. Please don't disappear on me. Okay. Promise me? We don't have to make any promises. I'm here right now. I'm not going anywhere. Promises don't have to be kept. They are there to make us feel better. To be honest, it is kind of fun being with you. But... But what? Can you let go of my hand now? Right. I can bring your father back, TK. In the past, I usually steal small things. Shall we go for something bigger this time? What do you mean? Every year, new students enroll in our school, and just like with you, it's not easy to get into this school. Please help us out, Director. Isn't it a good thing? The director can use the money to make improvements to the school. Think about it. Since you moved here, has anything been improved or changed for the better apart from the director who gets fatter, and fatter, and fatter? Are you planning to steal the director's money? It's not his money. It's the money he stole from the students. What's your plan? In the director's office, there is a big poster behind his desk. Behind that poster, there is a hidden safe. However, this plan will only be successful if we know how to break into the safe. The police have been following me all day. Shall we abort the plan? Our plan is very well-prepared. But if we get caught, we will be in big trouble, Nanno. So, what then? It's fine. I can do it alone. -Hang on, Nanno. -Why are you following me? We are not going with the plan anymore. I'm backing out of this for you. I don't want you to get caught. I'm not scared. You can't stop me. Wait. I will do it on one condition. If you get caught, blame it on me. Tell them I tricked you into it. -You... -Do we have a deal? How about our promise to not disappear on each other? If this is about our promise... I will break it for you. Can you promise me? Promise me, okay? Can you? We will go with the original plan tonight. I'm ready, Nanno. Are you sure that you want to go in alone? I'm sure. You can start. All right. You can go in now. I found the safe, Nanno. -Keep an eye out, Nanno. -I know. I found the documents, Nanno. Wait a moment, officer. Let me talk to the kid in private first. -Sure, Director. Go ahead. -Thank you. Let's go, everyone. As for what happened, usually, there's a way to settle it. Your father probably knows how to handle this. I've already informed him. This time, you can't steal my father's money. Even though I didn't get the documents, I have the footage from all of your security cameras as evidence. Imagine if it got out. She had nothing to do with this. Actually, she has everything to do with it. Isn't that right? All the footage was saved on this computer. She deserves to be a student at our school. Director, there is a parent here to see you. Let him in. I can bring your father back, TK. We heard that there was some unruly behavior. So, my boss sent a small gift in exchange for you to forget about everything. He also said that he will cover the cost of any damages you have incurred. NARUECHIT LAORSRI Tell my father that money can't buy everything. -We probably won't see each other again. -Don't do that, boy. Don't do that, sir! -Sir, please calm down. -Hello there. -Director. -Officers, take him away. YOUTH DETENTION CENTER Now that you're out, don't come back here again. Are you that surprised to see your own father? Why are you here? You're mean, just like your mother. I don't want to see you. I don't want your money. I can survive on my own. All right. I just stopped by. I'll leave soon. I just wanted to make sure that you would be okay on your own. Take care, son. Father. Father. People don't appreciate what they have until it's gone. When I said that I could bring your father back, I saw that it was necessary to take you away from your father first. I know. I understand completely. What if I don't want to lose something? I don't want to lose you. Subtitle translation by Pet-chompoo Sa-ngarmangkang
