 All of us have heard countless apologies in this beautiful world. If we make a mistake, we apologize. And yet, we still make more mistakes. Perhaps our apology is actually meant for our next mistake. Hey, guys. Where were you? You skipped practice again. There is a new girl. She's in classroom B. -Classroom B? -Is she pretty?

 Would I be telling you about her if she wasn't pretty? -Let's go. -Let's go. What are we waiting for? Where? -Which one? -That one. She's my type. She's exactly my type. What about Nan? No one else matters anymore. But I found out her name first. She must be mine then. -What the heck? -What's her name? I'm not telling you. Guys, she looked at me just now. No, she looked at me.

 You guys are wrong. She smiled at me just now. Are you sure? I told you to practice for the competition. What are you doing here? Are you already good enough? Aren't you being unfair to your hardworking teammates? -They are-- -What's all this loud noise? Well... They skipped their basketball practice, ma'am. I'm sorry for being so loud. I see. Let's go. Hurry. Everyone, let's continue. I was talking about... I-Tim, who were those three guys? They are "The Three Points." They are our school's basketball players. They are funny. They are troublemakers. Don't pay attention to them, Nanno. Do you like them, I-Tim? They are handsome, but they already have so many fans. I can't compete with all their fans. Keep running until I get tired. Good. Why did you skip practice? To check out a girl. Great. -Is she pretty? -Yes, she is. Hok, were you the one who led your friends there? I'm sorry, Coach. Don't apologize. I asked you a question. Were you the one who led your friends there? Yes, Coach. That's just great. Faster! The Hainanese chicken rice was so good. Come on! I'm not tired yet. Faster. Have you found out her name? It's Nanno. WHO IS THIS NANNO? THE NEW GIRL IN 11TH GRADE, CLASSROOM B. SHE'S CUTE. YOU CAN ALREADY TELL SHE'S BITCHY JUST BY HER NAME. SHE MOVED HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEMESTER. SHE MUST BE TROUBLED. DID SHE GET EXPELLED FROM HER OLD SCHOOL? CAN HER SKIRT BE ANY SHORTER THAN THAT? SHE'S SO SEXY. I WILL BE A GOOD BOY ONCE I GET TO HAVE SEX WITH HER. WHICH RHINOPLASTY SURGEON DID SHE GO TO? SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE GOT HER WHOLE FACE DONE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? WHY ARE YOU INSULTING HER? YOU MUST THINK YOU ARE SO PRETTY. I-Tim. -Is this for me? -Yes. -Are you giving me two boxes? -No. Don't be greedy. You are good friends with Nanno, right? Give this one to Nanno for me. Wait. What's wrong, I-Tim? Hok asked me to give this to you. You can eat it. I don't like it. No, thanks. Don't argue with each other. Just share it, all right? -All right? -No, thanks. I don't want to eat someone's leftovers. I'll eat it then. Actually, it's good that you're not eating it. Why? It looks delicious. You are chubby. You might want to lose weight. I think she looks cute being chubby. I found a shirt. -Really? -Yes. It was beautiful. Which shop was it? Did they have one in my size? Don't you understand how hard it is to find a shirt in your size? What's up? Do you want them? These concert tickets will get you backstage. All I can say is that they are really rare. It's the band Japan! I want to watch it. What do you really want? Well... My parents will be out of town. So, we are having a small party. We want to invite you guys... And Nanno? -Yes. -Yes. So these tickets are our payment to take Nanno with us. It's not like that. -Why do you think that? -What's wrong? These tickets are just tokens of our appreciation. I see. What if Nanno doesn't want to go? Will you get us drunk? -Hey. -No. -Will you get Nanno drunk? -Yes. -Shut up. -What are you talking about? I mean, yes, the party will be fun. -That's right. -Yes. Take these tickets back. Invite her yourselves. But we are not going. That's right. Try to use your brains for better things. Don't you want these exclusive tickets? -No. -No. I told you so. Let's be honest. Aren't you tired of people coming to us just to get to Nanno? That's crazy. It's not like that. Aren't you overthinking this? I'm not overthinking it. -It's not like that. -So many people have come to us. It's fine. Good morning, Taew and I-Tim. Good morning. It serves him right. He's finally gone. Nanno, don't you like Hok at all? How about you? Do you like anyone? I used to, but not anymore. Guys aren't trustworthy. I agree. What a waste though, the flower. You hit it so hard. If you like it, you can take it. I hate flowers, especially roses. You hate them? Why? I don't know. I just hate them. SHE'S SO PRETENTIOUS. I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM, YET SHE STILL FLIRTS WITH HIM. SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM, YET SHE STILL FLIRTS WITH HIM. SHOULD WE USE THE WORD "SLUTTY" INSTEAD? SHE PROBABLY WANTS ALL THREE OF THEM. DON'T INSULT MY NANNO. OH, DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH HER? HOW MUCH? I DON'T PAY FOR SEX. SHE'S WORTH 4,000 BAHT, I GUESS. CAN I ASK FOR A DISCOUNT? JUST 500 BAHT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR HER. YOU CAN GET HER FOR FREE. I HEARD EVERYONE HAD SEX WITH HER ALREADY. What's up? There is a new cafÃ©. -It looks good. -Really? -Let's go. -Let's go. Hurry. -Nanno, are you coming with us? -Yes. Let's go. Taew. Are you free? Can you teach me math? I have a math exam tomorrow. I don't know anything. I know you don't. You don't study at all. I do. But this is the best I can do. Damn. Sit down. You can leave now. No, it's fine. We'll wait for you. Okay. -Hurry up. -Okay. All you do is play basketball. How will that make you smarter? What do you want me to do? Can you do it? No. Well, thanks. Look. This one, right? The median is this. After this... Let me jot it down for you. Sure. If you can do this, then you will know the method. You want to divide by 1,000 people, right? Try to use this formula. It will be 3x multiply by 3y plus 32. Remember to always use this method. Now, you have 44.3. You... Taew, what's wrong? -Taew. -Taew. Wait. Do you still like Neung? I thought you told me that you didn't like him anymore. Seriously, what do you see in him? He has a bad personality and he's stupid. He's not stupid. He's just not good at studying. I don't know why I love him. I'm sorry. Don't talk to me. Go away. Fine. I'll go. Come outside when you are done crying. Taew... Let's go to the concert. Sure. Let's go. I've been wanting to see that band for a long time. -Bottoms up! -Bottoms up! How can you drink so much, Nanno? Come on. One more? Let's get some snacks. -Okay. -We'll be back. Taew, why is Nanno not getting drunk at all? -The guys will get drunk first. -Shut up. Why don't you just shout it to her face? One more? I think we need our ultimate recipe. Let's mix whiskey, beer, punch, and vodka together. Where did you get this? It's my mom's. It will make her unconscious. How many pills do we use? Let's use three. -Should we add them now? -Sure. We can add them now. -Oh, no. I-Tim. -Put them away. It's empty. Snacks are here. Let's drink some more. Refill your glasses. -Give me the glass. -Okay. Five pills? I thought you said three. -I'm just making sure. -Hurry. -Why do you like alcohol? -I don't know. -Here. Everyone, refill your glasses. -Yes. -Come on. -Cheers. Let's do this. I want to drink this one with Nanno. -Great. -Great! Bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -One more? -Bottoms up. -Yes. -Yes -Bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -Bottoms... -Bottoms... -Wait. -Wait. Where are you taking her? Leave her here. We want to see her, too. -Yes. Let us see her, too. -Are you crazy? We don't want to see anything. You can go anywhere, just not here. That's right. You guys can go after me. Can I go first? Mine's the smallest. Please. This is my house. -I will go first. -Fine. -Hurry up. -Yes. -Yes. -Can you carry her? -Go. -Okay. -How do I do this? -Oh, god. -Aren't you going to ask? -Fuck. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I don't want an apology. I want you to ask for my permission. Well... Can I... have sex with you? Do you want to try again? I think you can do better than that. Well... Can I have sex with you? I love you. "I love you." Wait, Nanno. You don't need to eavesdrop. Taew. Are you that mad at me that you won't let me out? You can only come out after they're done having sex with you. I'm ready. We can do it all together. I-Tim. Do you want to trade places with me? Hok, hurry and do what you need to do. Hurry! Hurry. You're not going to ask me anymore? How is it? Is it good? It's okay. Anything as soft as tofu always turns me on. Hok. Let me go first if you are not hard yet. I agree. Should we let your friend go first? Why the fuck are you laughing? You won't stop laughing? Stop laughing. Fuck. Fuck. Shit. Hok, what did you do to her? I-Tim. If anyone finds out, we will be expelled. Being expelled will be the least of our worries. We will get arrested. I haven't done anything. Weren't you lining up? What are you talking about? You were the one who locked her in. Otherwise, she wouldn't have died. Me? Then go to the police and tell them that you were lining up and watching me lock her up. What... What should we do? We need to bury her body. -I think that's enough. Let's stop. -Yes. Hurry up. Hok, go wait in the hole. Hurry. Hurry up. Faster. Hurry. Nanno. I'm sorry. I didn't want it to end this way. Are you done wailing? Can you help us now? -Hurry up. -Go. Take this pile. Shit. Help her! Help her? Do you want to get arrested? What are we waiting for? Help her! You will get arrested if you help her. What should we do? -Kill her! -Kill her yourself! You coward! Are you going to wait for her to get up? Fuck. Hurry up. Dig over there! Hurry up, Hok. I'm sorry, Nanno. Please forgive me. I'm sorry, Nanno. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come in. Get your books out, everyone. Taew, I-Tim. Weren't you going to wake me up at all? Do you think she knows about last night? I don't know. Oh, no. Do you want some? You look so pale. We probably got really drunk last night. Who are you? Did you forget me already, Taew? I'm Nanno. Do you have Alzheimer's? You are not Nanno. If I'm not Nanno, then who am I? Are you Nanno's twin? That's crazy. I-Tim. How did you come up with that? Guys. Both of you look sick today. Let me give you a checkup. Your pulse is strong. Your temperature is fine, too. You guys are probably not sick. And... this wound on your hand is so ugly. It looks like you did some digging. Listen. The party last night was so fun. Don't forget to invite me next time. So this means that she didn't disappear. Are we out of trouble now? Are you crazy? Do you think this girl posing as Nanno has no objectives? What do you want us to do? Kill another person? You should think before you ask anything. She knows all of us. She knows this place. She knows about the party last night. And she even knows that we were digging. And she said that she wanted to party here again. Is it her twin? She said she was Nanno. I don't want to be involved in this anymore. If you want to kill one more person, then go ahead. Isn't your father a teacher? -Stop. -Don't get my father involved in this. I don't want to. But if anyone finds out, you're going down. Your father will go down with you. What are you doing here? Don't sound so distant like that. Did you forget about last night? Hello. Everyone is here but you didn't invite me. You guys are mean. I'm kidding. I just forgot my phone. It's probably in Hok's bedroom. Fuck. The bed is so soft. It's too bad I only spent a short time on it. Do you want to join me? Let's relive some history. Don't you love me anymore? Were you going to dump me after? I found it. There are some great videos here. Do you want to watch them with me? Never mind. I'll watch them alone. Can I have sex with you? I love you. Taew. Are you that mad at me that you won't let me out? You can only come out after they're done having sex with you. Hok, hurry and do what you need to do. Hok. Let me go first if you're not hard yet. I haven't done anything. Weren't you lining up? What... What should we do? We need to bury her body. It's such a shame that that is all I have. Great videos like these should be shared, right? -No! -Don't do that! What should we do? -We're here. -Hurry. I'm sorry, Nanno. Please forgive me. I'm sorry, Nanno. Please forgive me. Is it there? -Find it. Be careful. -I'm sorry. That's enough! Are you guys tired? Actually, I think we should celebrate your success so you'll stop feeling tired. Take this! And this! Today has been so fun, guys. What the fuck is she? Nanno is Nanno. I told you before, -but you wouldn't listen. -Fuck. I'm new at school. I want to know you guys better. Please be my friends. Fuck. Hurry up. Here. I'm sorry. You're sorry again? Get home safely. I'll see you tomorrow, handsome. In this beautiful world, everyone apologizes as if it's some kind of tradition. Could you please pass me the ball? If we make a mistake, we apologize. And even if we make the same mistake, we still apologize. Hello, everyone. This is humanity.
