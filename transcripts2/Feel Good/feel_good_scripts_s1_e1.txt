 # You're a hippie # You're a nothing # You're a yuppie # You're a something # You're the wasteland... # {\an1}LAUGHTER # Built on the quicksand COMEDIAN: Although, actually, I have to say, I don't think it's the most fun you can have with your clothes on. It's fucking with your clothes on. LAUGHTER I recommend it. It's a lot of fun. Just, like, in a tuxedo.

 You know, pull your bowtie to the side. Like, rip the tie back so you can go down on someone. {\an1}LAUGHTER It's just like a really good day out. {\an1}LAUGHTER Yeah, you guys like that? This guy doesn't like it. {\an1}LAUGHTER I'm going to do new stuff tonight. There's a stag do in the back that keeps shouting "minge" every five minutes.

 {\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE {\an1}That was Jack Barry! HE CHUCKLES {\an1}How's everyone feeling? You good? CHEERING Are you ready for the next act? CHEERING Yes, fantastic. Now, she's a good friend of mine. She's become a permanent fixture on my sofa bed recently, but she doesn't pay any fucking rent, so she needs your support. Please give it up for Mae Martin! {\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Thanks, man. Hi, guys. I'm Mae. Did everyone have a good childhood? {\an1}LAUGHTER I'm from Canada. I came over in a canoe recently with Celine Dion. LAUGHTER She was at the helm. I'm recently single. Is anybody single? Give me a cheer. CHEERING Woo! Um, yeah. And it's fine. I'm doing fine. I'm...I'm catching up on my reading - just reading my ex's Facebook page. LAUGHTER That's all that I read. I feel weird recently, and the only way I can describe it is like I feel like I'm full of birds. Not like hummingbirds, like I'm anxious, but, like, pelicans. Like, very greasy pelicans in my chest. I don't know if you've ever seen a photo after an oil spill, and the beach is just... There's all these birds and they're covered in oil and they can't lift their wings, and they're like... They're in my chest. SHE LAUGHS Thank you, one person, for laughing. Can you tell your friend I'm going to flush her phone down the toilet if she doesn't stop texting? Sorry. Who are you texting? I'm not texting. I'm playing Candy Crush. CROWD MURMUR AND LAUGH No, that's fine. That's absolutely fine. It's very important that I stay humble, so... Did my mother hire you? {\an1}LAUGHTER MAN: Minge! {\an1}UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER See, that's funny. That's really funny! God, I loved that! Mm. It just makes you think, like, everything is perspective. Mm. You know, like...like, OK, I look at this and I see a pint glass, right? But you might see some...hazelnuts, OK? And we wouldn't even know. HE CHUCKLES Hey, have I ever told you my story about ham? No. You're going to love it. HE LAUGHS Hold that thought. Just going to go get my Tupperware from the cloakroom. OK. George, why did you drag us here? I literally hate comedy. It's so embarrassing. That girl was so rude to me! Binky, you were on your phone all the way through her set. SHE LAUGHS I know! I'm so bad! Binks, what did you tell Jarod? Oh, I told him that you fancy him. Oh, Jesus! Why did you do that?! Because you haven't been with anyone since Andrew. That's five years ago. Your vagina is going to seal up. It's about this big. It's got coleslaw in it. No? Right, let's go. The car is outside. You know, actually, I think I'm going to walk. Yeah, and I'm going to go to the bathroom, too, so you guys go. Yeah. OK. Bye. Bye. No. Can I get double gin and tonic, please? Oh, man, that was hard work. That girl was laughing, though. What? Nah, come on. Why not? I mean, have you seen her? She's like England's rose. And I'm like a kernel of corn that somebody glued onto some sticks. {\an1}HE CHUCKLES She's like a dangerous Mary Poppins. I'm like Bart Simpson. That's funny. So, what should I do? Go talk to her or what? Yeah. She's been here, like, three times, only laughing at your stuff. And your stuff is bad. Thank you! What's the worst that can happen? Oh, humiliation, loneliness, depression... Hello? ..regret. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Oh, sorry. You're busy. I... Yeah, I just wanted to say sorry about my friend. So, sorry. No. Fine. How...? How are...who are you? Uh, I'm George. Hi. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Do you understand the rules of this game? Yeah. OK. I think so, yeah. It's very straightforward. OK. How old are you? 29. When did you lose your virginity? Um, just...yesterday! THEY LAUGH Just yesterday! What's your favourite film? SHE LAUGHS Coyote Ugly. Coyote Ugly! That's not true. OK. OK. My turn. How long have you been in England? Two years. Who's your favourite member of the Beatles. Brian. Are we on a date? I...I don't know. Are we? Well, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you. Well, I don't know. Do you want to be on a date? Why are we fighting right now? SHE LAUGHS Right. I'm going home. What's your plan? I'm going to stay out for a bit. So shall I pull out the sofa bed, or...? I don't know, man. OK. Well, do you have your key? I'm in the middle of a very riveting conversation, Nick, so maybe I'll text you later. Right. Well, I'll see you in, what, six months, yeah? Enjoy your date! Wow. He said it was a date. Yeah. So I guess it is. Mm. I've never been on a date with a girl before. Yeah. Oh, no. Absolutely. Yeah. No. Yeah, yeah. OK. So, then would you say that you've ever kissed a girl? Yeah. I mean, yeah. I'm not Mormon. Oh, OK. Yeah. Oh, that's a shame. Oh. I exclusively date Mormons. Oh! Well... Do you like films? You want to kiss me, Mae? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah? Oh, look, that would be so cool. Now? Yes. Well, anyways... Oh... Oh, my God. Phil! Christ, can you wear tap shoes or something? Sorry, Mae, this is my flatmate. I found him online. Hey. Hey. Um, Mae was just going to help me arrange my shoes. Are you OK? I have depression. Oh, I'm sorry. OK, thank you, Phil. Mae, my shoes are upstairs. OK. So, this is my room. # Whoa # Oh-oh # Come down from the mountain You have been gone too long # The spring is upon us Follow my only song MAE YELLS INDISTINCTLY Oh, my gosh, no! Fuck, no! # Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning # You should come back home... # No... # Back on your own now # Oh-oh OVER PHONE SPEAKER: # The world is alive now... # Can you turn off that music, please, and stop touching my hand, please? {\an1}MUSIC STOPS George? Georgina? Excuse me? Can you wake up, please? Wait, what's happening? Why are you over there? I couldn't sleep. I'm too pumped. So I went out and went for a walk. I got you two coffees, like a lottery ticket and some Bombay mix. And while you were sleeping, I painted a very beautiful portrait of you. It's like a moving-in gift. SHE EXHALES So, what do you want to do today? You want to go to IKEA? A very big day for us. Can you just lie on top of me and tell me something Canadian? On July 1st, 1867, the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada were declared the Dominion of Canada, with John A. MacDonald its first Prime Minister. Wow. Mm. Oh, my... This is a masterpiece. I know. Oh, fuck. I didn't get you any presents. Excuse me, I don't need presents. It's the greatest gift of my life that I get to have sex with goddamn Princess Diana every day. {\an1}SHE CHUCKLES OK, I'm going to make today really good. Oh yeah? Yeah, honestly. Yeah. It's just... It's just... It's new for me. What is? Well, all of this. Letting someone penetrate my inner sanctum. I call my flat my inner sanctum. Oh, that's so weird. That's what I call your pussy. SHE LAUGHS No! George? Mm? Can we invite some of these people round tonight? Some of your friends? We could have, like, a dinner, and I could meet them? Like, who is this? Mm, no. Sorry, no. I have this, um, work meeting tonight. It's the whole English department. On a Saturday? Mm. Yeah. SKYPE CALL RINGING Oh, shit. That's my parents. {\an5}Um, I have to Skype my parents. You want to talk to them? Mm, yeah. Oh, cool. Mm. Hi, Mom. Mae. Hi, Linda. Oh, Georgina. Oh, well, now, don't look at me. I'm 3,000 years old. MAN IN BACKGROUND LAUGHS You two are just the vision of beauty and youth, as per usual. How's cohabitation? Oh, it's so great. Um, it's been a big adjustment. Oh, Georgina, don't look at me. I mean what I say. Hello, darling daughter. Oh, hello, George. {\an1}How lovely. Hi, Dad. How are you? Er, well, madly in love with your mother, of course. Oh, please stop. I'm a repulsive old witch. So, Georgina, when are we going to meet you? I think it's outrageous we haven't met you yet. Um, well, you do live in Canada, so... Yeah, it's been three months, guys. Chill. Oh, your mother and I moved in together after five days. That's true. We just knew. Now, Mae, your father and I want to know if you've found a new Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Um... A what meeting? A what meeting? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. Mom, can you please stop dredging up the past? Please. Don't say "dredging". That's disgusting. All right, so, I'm off. I'm not saying I want to talk about the past, believe you me. I just want to know that you're going to a regular meeting. I've been very busy. I've been moving in with George and I...I can't sleep these days. You can't sleep? It's not a big deal. Oh, my God. All right, I think I should just tell you. I think that's because you were four weeks premature. Was I? You were in an incubator, sweetheart. It's why we're not close. Are we not close? And now I have to go. Find a regular meeting. Yeah, bye. {\an1}KNOCKING AT DOOR So, I-I just found out I'm super premature. You're in Narcotics Anonymous? It's really not a big deal. I've been sober for ages. I honestly don't want to talk about it any more. I just want to enjoy being in this beautiful furniture store with you. Oh, I'm going to get this one. Mae, that is fucking massive. Yeah. No, look, just get this one, OK? Oh, cool. Thanks. So, OK, tell me, what is...what is "ages sober"? Like, six years? Six months? A week? Yes. Yes? Yes what? Why won't you talk to me? I am talking to you. Then... OK, look. I don't know if this is new information to you or if this is something that you're aware of already, but you have the number one best face I've ever seen in real life. Mae, thank you, that's really kind, but you say that to me every day. Cos it's true. I've seen 'em in films, but not like this. It's like milk. Stop. You're a milk maid. Mae, stop it. Should I be worried? No. Honestly, it's very old news. Yeah? Look, there's so much stuff that I didn't know about you when we moved in together, and I'm having to adjust. Like, I had no idea that you have a mug that says "I heart Guernsey" on it. Is that true? Do you heart Guernsey? What even is a Guernsey? SHE LAUGHS It's making me question everything. Mae, I love you, so please find a meeting so I can relax. Yeah, if you love me, I'll go right now. Yeah? Yeah. On one condition, though. OK. I'm going to get this wardrobe. My name's David and I'm an addict. GROUP: Hi, David. Er, first up on the agenda today, happy birthday to Karen. Karen let us know last week that it was going to be her birthday, so, er, we wish you a joyous and a sober day. And I've brought in some of my devilled eggs as a snack. Second of all, a warm welcome to any newcomers. Er, hi, I'm Mae. I'm Mae, I'm an addict. GROUP: Hi, Mae. Welcome, Mae. Does anyone want to share? David, I'd like to start. My name is Karen and I'm an addict. GROUP: Hi, Karen. First up, I'd like to come clean. It's not my birthday. I don't know why I said that. Anyway, something that is... WHISPERS: Is there coffee? Just eggs. Yes, Mae has something to share. Oh, no, no. I'm fine. I don't...I don't think I really need to be here. Yeah, you seem like a really fun crew, but, um, I've been clean a long time and, um, I think for me the main problem is that I was very premature. I was actually in an incubator. Anyway, I hate eggs. What do we say to newcomers, guys? GROUP: Keep coming back. It works. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just premature. Ah, it's so boring in there, isn't it? I can't... I can't bear it either. I just hate eggs, you know what I mean? So do I! They're loathsome. I call them the devil's orbs. That's funny. Can I get you a coffee? You look like you need a coffee. I love coffee. I find it so weird that it comes from beans. Isn't that bizarre? SHE LAUGHS I'm Maggie. I'm Mae. Good to meet you. This is actually the, um, exit. Oh... {\an1}THEY LAUGH I want you to do something for me. I want you to take your past and I want you to put it in a box. Have you done that? Yeah. Now, take that box and throw it in the bin and flush that bin down the toilet. Oh, man. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know where my past is? Where? It's in a box, in a trench, at the bottom of the ocean. Only James Cameron has seen it. {\an1}SHE LAUGHS Wow. Oh, God, I'm sorry, but I've hated every single mouthful of that coffee and I must do something about it now, otherwise I will die! I don't know why I come here. You want to know how to fix your brain? Simple. Just stay busy. Never don't be doing something, ever. I'm far too busy to think about drugs. So, do you have kids and stuff, or...? I have hobbies. I bake, I kayak, I weave my own clothes on a loom. {\an1}Sometimes I just run to Kent. {\an1}SHE LAUGHS I've been clean for 12 years. {\an1}MAN CLEARS THROAT Oh, don't look at me like that, Ethan! It just doesn't make sense to me. I just... How can someone so clean and fresh be an ex-junkie? She smells like laundry. It makes sense, man. I mean, her legs are always moving, her eyes are spooky. Yes, but you know about addicts cos you're from, um... Hollywood. I'm from Hollywood. You gotta make her feel safe. Mm. I don't know, make this place more Canadian or something. Canada? Yeah, I can do that. Thanks. I don't think we've ever had a proper conversation before. Becoming friends. All right, up top. OK. All right. Brunch on Thursday? No, thank you. Friday? I think you should take up capoeira. I'm sorry, but I really, really do. Oh, my God, you're like a prophet. Thank you so much, I gotta go, but I'm gonna call you. Or, actually, do you want to be my sponsor? Cos I don't think I really need the meetings. No, no, no, neither do I! But maybe we could just hang out and then that would be like the same thing? Yeah, yeah. Any time, night or day. And remember, throw your past in the bin and just stay busy. Stay busy! THEY LAUGH Bye. Yeah. Wait, what...what do you mean, you're not going back? I'm just not going back. They only had eggs, it was bullshit. Oh, oh, wow, yeah, that's so cool. You're such a rebel. Mae, you're like James Dean. OK, but check it out. I got a sponsor. I met this weird woman and she said I just need to stay really busy instead. I... Wait. Do you actually think I look like James Dean? Mae, I... Isn't the first rule of these meetings accepting that you have a problem? I had a problem and now I have you. You can't just have me, OK? I don't just have you. I have work and I have my friends and... {\an1}MAE SCOFFS Yeah. What? What is that? All right, how come I've never met any of your friends? She makes a good point. I'm sorry, can we not have this conversation in front of Phil, please? I'm going to introduce you when I'm ready, OK? But this conversation is about you, actually. Well, maybe I didn't tell you about it because I didn't think you'd get it. We've had very different lives and you grew up, like, in a bag of feathers. Er, Oxford, actually, I grew up in Oxford. Have you ever heard of it? Maybe I'd get it if you explained it, but you don't, OK? So, I have to, like, root around in all of your stuff. You went through my stuff? Yes! It says here that you wrote this in hospital. And...and that you owe someone called Ink Boy $800. Oh, and what is this? Is this, like, a.... like, a drugs hat? Mae, where are you going? Oh, my God. {\an1}PSYCHADELIC ROCK MUSIC Fuck! I don't... What the fuck was that? New me, new life. I have everything under control. Said every junkie, ever. Oh, Mae. I... Oh. God, why do you have to be so intense? I am not...intense. I'm sorry. I... So, I'm jizzing and I'm jizzing and I'm jizzing. I'm jizzing like a goddamn machinegun. Jizz, jizz, jizz, jizz, jizz, jizz, jizz. Reload! Why did you book this terrible man? That's Pete. People love Pete. If they like him, they're not going to like me. Ah, well. You'd be surprised. People are mad. Yeah, but... {\an1}HIGH-PITCHED RINGING {\an1}HE SNORTS Ee-hee-hee! You're up next. Where you been all my life, baby? Oh, er, what is this? {\an1}Do you like it? It's my new gimmick. CROWD CHEERS Fuck yeah, I'm the fucking king! Woo! Wahey! Who's this guy? Oh. # Slam your body down and wind it all around # If you want to be my lover... # So, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I bring in my packed lunch, I have my usual, which is... Ham. Ham. Then Tuesday, Thursday, I go into the cafeteria. What do you think they're serving on both days this particular week? Ham? {\an1}HE LAUGHS So, that's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday - ham, ham, ham, ham, ham. I'm seeing someone, sorry. OK. Well, I feel like a regular old ham head. {\an1}THEY LAUGH What's his name? Um, Jonathan....Crenshaw. Jonathan Crenshaw. Yeah. Yep. Well, you know, when the cat's away, the mice hit the town and... I don't remember the exact saying, but... NEW SONG STARTS Oh, shit, this is me. # One can have a dream, baby # Two can make that dream so true... # Fuck off, Jared! # One can talk about being in love, two can say how it really feels # One can wish... # # Call me any time... # {\an1}NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE # Crawl # I cried for you # Died for you... # Hi. Hi. What do you want to know? Everything? I got addicted to coke when I was a kid and my parents kicked me out. I sold drugs, I overdosed, I...I went to jail. I just really, really, I want it to be over. {\an1}SHE SIGHS OK. Really? Yeah. Cool. So, is there anything else that we need to talk about? Like, did you want to tell me about your friends and why you're being... Er, why don't you just go down on me? OK, that sounds good, yeah. {\an1}PHONE CHIMES {\an1}HIGH-PITCHED RINGING
