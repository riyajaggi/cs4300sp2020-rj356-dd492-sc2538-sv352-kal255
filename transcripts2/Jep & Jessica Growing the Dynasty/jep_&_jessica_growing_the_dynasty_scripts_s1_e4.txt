 Darling.Hey. Thought about tomorrow yet? Look at this rash, babe. It's gotten worse. Yeah, I believe you. Come here. Look how bad this is. Okay, I'll look at the rash. Can you just, like, look it up? Something's bad wrong there. I know. It's making my eyes water. I've tried all these different butt pastes,

 and they don't work. I'm not sure there's anything that can be done for that. Seriously? I don't want to look at that anymore. Ooh, damn, he's got it bad. I know it. Bless his heart. No wonder why he stays up through the night, crying. When it comes to rashes around sensitive areas, usually a man will stay away. And the mom will get the job done and get him all healed up. I mean, that's what moms are for. We take care of our babies. We take care of all our babies.

 I'm glad you do what you do. I just could not do it. Let's talk about tomorrow, Jess, because tomorrow is the day. Our 14th-year anniversary. Turns out somebody forgot our anniversary this year, and it wasn't me. That's the first time I've ever done that. I said I'm sorry. Well, I just wanna linger in the fact that I remembered something you forgot. How many times has that happened? Once. Just once. Exactly, so I'm going to linger in it. Yes. Let me take him and get him better, at least on the mend, and we'll get a babysitter, and maybe we can go out to eat or something. I just want some mommy-daddy time. You know? I want some me, some you, come together, and just mold into one. Just... just tangled-- All right, you need to get out of here. Just all tangled up. You just need to get out of here. Let's get tangled up later. All right. He's normally not this fussy. No, he's not. This rash, I mean... Jess! What? I know. It's awful. It's raw. I did them all. I tried everything. Honey? Have you tried it? Yes, there's plenty of bees. The local bee honey. It cures everything. No, it'll be sticky. Come here. Aw, baby. Here, put this new one on him. Nick. Yeah. Come here and look at this. It's like-- look. Nelly. Sorry. Please cover it up. Jep. I've already seen it. I'm not looking again. Everybody knows babies are cute, but, you know, they do a lot of things that people don't want to talk about. The spit up, the diarrhea, the pee, buggers, snot, yucky stuff. There's lot of... Well, you know what's funny is that you do all those things too. I'm a free spirit. You know? I let my body do what it does. It's not normal for someone to have so many sounds coming out of their body. I take that as a compliment. It's offensive, is what it is. It's not offensive to me. I know it's been a while, but when our girls had rashes, what did we do? You put breast milk on it. I didn't-- bre-- I never put breast milk on it. I do know peeing on, jellyfish stings, it cures up. You can pee on it. No, 'cause the acid in his pee is what's burning. Mix it with honey. Emily... No, that's gross. How do you--And, by the way, where would she get breast milk? She's not even breast feeding. I know. I dried up, like, seven years ago. Yeah. You can probably buy some off the Internet. Black-market breast milk.Yep. I've heard of it. Or we could go to the doctor and get something, a prescription that actually will work. It's not a bad point. Let's just go take him. Yeah, we'll take him. Y'all got the kids? We always do. Get him straightened out. Okay, watch our girls. Said get him straightened out. Will. Love you. Grab her bag. Old Dr. Trejo. This diaper rash has, like, consumed my thoughts. I mean, so much so that Jep came in and told me this morning that our anniversary is tomorrow. I completely forgot. Nuh. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. My gosh, that's the first. I was like, "It's really bad when the wife forgets the anniversary." You know you have a lot going on. Yeah, like a new baby. I didn't even have time to order my gift, so now I'm going to have to overnight it, at best, or I'll just order him something and, like, give him a picture of it to let him know that I-- it is coming. Like a I-O-U. Yeah, but I don't like to I owe him. I mean, it is important, like really sad I forgot. I think men totally look at anniversaries in a different way than women. I think women are all about something sentimental. Emily is opposite because she's the dude in the relationship. I was really excited about when Nick gave me that nice vacuum cleaner. It was an awesome gift until I found out that he got it out of y'all's trash can. You didn't know. He got it out of our trash can? Yeah, that orange and gray one? I s--Well, thank you for our anniversary gift. You're welcome. It's awesome. I love it. I don't know. I just-- I've got to get him something. I think, if you gave him the razzle dazzle, y'all be pretty even. Is that what they're calling it these days? Or the old hokey pokey. What about pin the tail on the donkey? That couldn't hurt. Red Rover, Red Rover? Send Jeptha right over? Yes. Yes, I like that game. He would-- He would like that.Yep. Simon says. Yeah, that's always fun. Just about any kid game, you could use code for a little pat pat. Buddy. Him's cryin'. Sorry, Baby Jules. Mama should've bought you some earmuffs. Dude. Jarhead again. I know. You got the melee there, guy. Look at you. So, what anniversary is this for you? Fourteen. Fourteen. That's ivory. What do you mean, it's ivory? Like the first year's paper. Second year's, like, cloth. So on the 14th you're supposed to get her ivory. I don't think that's legal? I mean, I can get you some ivory if you want some. No, I don't want ivory. I mean, I don't think she would like that. This is my good friend Nick. We've been friends for probably 20 years? We actually met in a duck blind. Yep. And then you were like, "We should hang out some time." Kind of like you were asking me out on a date. Yeah. That's exactly what you said. I don't remember that. You were like, "We should hang out... I remember you saying, "Man, will you be my friend? 'Cause I don't have no friends." That's what you said. "You wanna hang out sometime?" Kids, what do you think I should get Mom for her anniversary? Mustache! Dude, my wife is not going to be happy about that. I hope that erases. Mommy likes it when you make "break-tiss." Yeah. Jess likes to eat. She does like to eat. Bub, what do you think I should get Mom? A limo. A limo? That's not a bad idea. Hello. Yo, what's up, guys? Hey, Dan. Dan's here. Danno. What are y'all doing? We're playing games. I brought this from your mom's house. It's a happy-anniversary cake. Miss Kay made that. She did. All right, I'll take it. So, Dan, if it was your 14th wedding anniversary, what would you give your lady? I would take her to a special place and look deep into her eyes... Into her soul. Yeah. And then you say, "Well, so far so good." And then pull out a gift at that point. All right, here's the deal with Dan. He's one of my oldest friends. Known him my whole life. He actually works for my mom and dad, and they actually call him their butler, which is kind of funny. Dan's cool. I like Dan. Yeah, he's just really awkward around girls. He is awkward. They just-- he's just got to find a girl who went past all that. He's like a penguin. When he-- He's kind of--I think when he mates, he'll mate for life. That's right. You know what I'm sayin'? He will. You know what I'm sayin'? In his little butler tuxedo. Yes. Dan, I like your idea about taking her somewhere special, I don't know if Dan's the best to ask for advice. I mean, Dan, you're not even married. That is true. But I dated one time. Just one time. How come you don't have a girlfriend? I'm playing really hard to get. Marshmallows. I love you. Hello. Hi. How are you? How's it going? It's going okay. Well, he has this, like, really severe diaper rash. Well, let's take a look. And he's so--... Yeah. How long has he had this? Four days now. Four days? I mean, I've treated it with-- like, with over-the-counter stuff, but that has not worked. Well, we're going to have to give a good dose of some type of antifungal cream for the yeast infection. Um, it is a yeast infection. How does-- How do babies get yeast infections? Heat and wetness. A diaper--You know all about that yeast infection. Wrong doctor. Sorry. I mean, I have to admit I'm a pretty good friend for going to the doctor with you. That's pretty awesome of me. I would do the same for you. Note to self-- if my kid gets a rash, you're coming. A butt rash on a nine-- almost ten year old is way different than a newborn baby's butt rash. Yeah. So look. We have, like, an anniversary thing coming up. Yes, ma'am. And I was going to leave him. It'll be okay. Okay. Well, let me go write the prescription, and I'll be right back. Thank you. Looks like you'll be able to do the hokey pokey after all. Emily! You lovin' it now? What do you think, girls? I love it. It looks good. You think Daddy's gonna like it? You're supposed to say it looks good. I always say you look good when you put on your new clothes. I think every guy should have a suit. Maybe I should get a purple one. That's just weird. Do you always wear outfits that match your braces? No. But your braces are the same color as your outfit. I know. Isn't that weird, though? It's awesome. It is awesome. So, you know, one day you'll be going on a date with your husband. What do you think about that? I think that I won't be doing that in, like, 30 years. That is a good answer. Show me pictures of assassins. I don't know if you want to see that. That looks kind of cool. Danno, thanks for coming, buddy. So you ready for this? I'm ready, dude. Mentally prepared. Got a good plan tonight. Jess, let's go. Hey.Hey. Whoa, good grief. Whoa. Dan, are you sure you can handle this? I can. I can. Lily, you know where the butt cream is? Okay. And he usually poops within 30 minutes after he eats. We're gonna have fun. Right? This is our 14th wedding anniversary. This is a special night. We can have a little alone time, have a little glass of wine. Romance. Yeah. With a capital R. But I will have to say I'm a little worried about leaving the baby. Jess, he's in good hands. I trust Dan. Don't know what he knows about rashes, but... maybe he can figure it out. He's a problem solver. If you need anything, I have my cell phone. Jep has his. So just text us, call us, whatever you need. Okay? We're going to be fine. We're going to be fine. All right. I love y'all. Okay. Love you, Mama. Bye, guys. Love you, kids. Okay, bye, guys. All right, baby. Here we go. Surprise. All right, baby. Here we go. Surprise. You got me a party bus? I sure did. Isn't that a bit much? Nope. Jep. Get you fired up. I love you. I love you. Yeah. What better way to commemorate 14 years of marriage than a party bus? I mean, I can think of a couple things, like jewelry and an outfit. But, I mean, a party bus is awesome. I mean, I think that's awesome. Thank you. W-- It's gonna be fun. A little strange, just for two of us, but I love it. I really do. I knew you'd love it. I got you something. Thank you. And... Are they red? Roses are the best. A little bit of the bubbly. Champagne? I mean, this is high class. I'm telling you. Here we go. Whoo! You ready for this? Jep! No-no-no-no! You should just twist it off. I'm really worried you're going to hit me. Here, get close. I'm scared. There's nothing gonna hurt you. You're-- Whoa. Here we go. Scared me. Whoa! Jep, you're making a mess.Hello. There you go. Thank you. A little bit of the lovin'. To a life that has been worth living because you are in it. I love you so much. I love you too. There you go. You love me, don't ya? I do love you. I always have. Always will. Thank you, babe. Anniversary. Fourteen years. Two for Robertson. You wanna say a toast? Toast. Here's to 14 years with my best friend and the love of my life, my mate at sea. Pretty good. Keep going. Okay. And here's to another... 60 years. Sixty is a weird number, but I'll toast to that. Because I don't know if we're going to live past 75. You know, I heard a very famous-- I mean, like very-- Jess, no phones at the dinner table. I know. I'm just making sure I didn't get a text. Just to make sure there was no emergency. I'm sure they're fine. They're in very capable hands. We're going to have to get some food for dinner. Okay, pizza. Pizza? No, no-- Pizza, pizza... No, wait-wait- wait-wait. What happened to the protein shakes stuff? We're getting protein, so y'all can deal with it. Pizza! Pizza! Pizza! We're not-- I'm not-- Why-- How'd you get my phone? Okay, phone's off. Speaking of that. Are you ready for your next big surprise? Yes. Hand it over. Get my phone out. No, I'm not surfing. I have an app where you can watch the baby at home. It's like a baby monitor anywhere you go. Are you kidding me? I could just, like, the whole night tonight, just sit here and watch that baby boy.Well... no, let's not do it all night tonight. You know what I'm saying. And he's peakin' around. From here on out. Hey, he just yawned. Can I have my phone back, please? Alligator Bolognese, sir. My goodness. Um, yum. Hey, did I do it right or did I do it right? Zang. All right, babe, put the phone away. Look at him. He seriously is the cutest guy. This is our dinner. I know. Sorry. All right, no more phone. It's just me and you. I'm focused. I'm focused. I'm starting to think my anniversary gift was a bad idea. Why? You're doing the opposite of what the gift is for. The gift is, like, to go, "Yes, I can look at my baby app, and he's good." That's what I'm doing. "I can have fun with my husband." But you're like, "No, what is he doing now? He just moved his head." You should be happy I love you so much. Best gift ever. I just think I'm going to regret giving you that gift. You can't take back the gift once you give it. Sorry. That was such a good night. I loved it. I'm ready to get home to the kids, though. Well, it ain't over yet, baby. What do you mean? Where are we going? Down to Shreveport. We're going to stay the night? Yeah, we're going to stay the night. But I didn't pack anything. Got you an overnight bag. Got all that stuff taken care of. Don't you miss the kids, though? I mean, I miss 'em. I miss them some, but, I mean, I want some mommy-daddy time. You know? It's a long drive just to have some alone time. Sometimes I just can't ignore my motherly instincts. You know, that one that says, "Alarm, I need to make sure the kids are okay. Alarm, alarm, what are the kids up to?" Yeah, turn that off. There's no off button for moms. I have an alarm too, but I just reach over and hit the snooze button and say, "We're going to get back to that--" Again. "as soon as we get back." Moms don't have snooze buttons. That is one annoying alarm. We can have alone time at the house and know that our kids are safe and home, and we're home with them. What do you think? We can go home and play a little Duck, Duck, Goose. A little Ring Around the Rosie. Okay. We'll play a little pin the tail on the donkey. Hey, driver? Can you take us home, please? Just don't throw it too high. You don't wanna hit me. Look what I built. If I didn't have the baby, I'd go knock it down. Hey, guys. Hey... What are you doing up? Ooh, you are back kinda early. Yeah. But it went good, didn't it? Yeah, it went awesome, man. It was great. It was great. We just missed y'all so much. Come here, kissy-face. I love drinking champagne and riding on party buses just like the next girl, but there comes a time in the night where you just want to be at home with your kids. Well, I guess the party's over. Babe, the party's not over. It's just moving. As long as we get mom-and-daddy time at the end of the night. Then I'm good. Done. We came back early, but I got a surprise. Who wants to take a limo ride? Yeah! Do you want to? Y'all do a limo ride. I'll watch the kid. Come on, Mama. Whoo! I will admit I do miss the kids. I love you, babe. I love you. It's the only present I need. All right, Gary, let's do it. Put the pedal to the metal. Go, River! Go, River! Whoo! Whoo! Jess, we're getting a little time upstairs later. Yeah! We wanna play! No. No-no-no-no-no... What's up, Baby Jules? Just had first anniversary since you've been born. It was a success. Kind of a perfect night. Your dad can show you how to plan these things out one day, buddy. Whoo, here comes Mama. Right here, buddy, look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You ready for your present? Yes, I'm ready for my present. Are you ready for your present? I am. Let me shut this camera off before-- No, you'll wanna see this. I thought maybe my present was under the robe. No, babe. Know what I'm sayin'? What is it? What? Your own golf cart. Yes! And it's red. Yes. All right. We love you, buddy. Love you. Mwah. Good anniversary.
