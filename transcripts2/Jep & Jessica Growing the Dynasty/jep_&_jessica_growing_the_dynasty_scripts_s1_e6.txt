 ain't right. What's wrong? We got a major problem. Do you have a toothache? No. You have a stomachache? No! You got hemorrhoids again? Hold on one second. No hemorrhoids this time. What is it? Jess. I have gained, like, two pounds since the baby was born. Two freakin' pounds. I'm jiggling. Seriously, Jep?

 Do you understand what I'm saying? Like, I'm getting fat. Well, it doesn't look like it. I'm a tub of goo right now. I cannot tell at all that you've gained any weight. That's what people tell fat people. No. I think you look sexy. This is post-pregnancy baby fat. Jep is way more sensitive than I am about gaining weight. I am not sensitive. Yes, you are. Maybe a little. I'm fixin' to start working out with Dan. I'm not gonna keep doing this. That's fine. Work out. I don't care.

 I'm gonna start ninja workouts again. Whatever makes you feel better. Maybe you should just try what I do-- carry the baby around. I don't think that's gonna work for me. You can't hold, like, even the infant carrier for very long. "It hurts my arms. My arms start burning." One time I walked, like, two miles. Yeah, that'll get your arms worn out. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna start tomorrow. You probably just need a good B.M. Babe, seriously? I'm gonna give you a blanket party tonight.Jep. And a Dutch oven. No, I don't want that. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Perfect timing. How you doing? Hey! How are you? Hey, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, Gussy! Godwin. Strength and honor. Strength and honor. You look fabulous. I do. I like a man in an apron. You look sexy. You need to wear one more often. I'm so excited you're gonna be doing the walkathon.Yeah. It's gonna be great. I'm gonna start y'all off. Well, I brought y'all a T-shirt. Look. Did you? The local foster care system is hosting a walkathon to raise awareness for all the kids that are available to adopt. And we're real excited that Wanda asked us to participate, and really just share with this community how many kids are available in this area. Try it on, Godwin. Try it on. I'm gonna try it on. It stretches. What? You can do it. Wait, your hat. Just take your hat off. This ain't... No. I can't breathe. Okay. Well... It looks great, Godwin.Look. This is the only one you got? "Project Gus" is the name of our team for the walkathon. It's really just honoring our new little baby, Gus. And our team's gonna win. It's not a competition, babe. Yeah, it is. Father, we just thank You so much for the blessings You give us, for your work on the cross. We just ask for blessings as we raise these kids, and help us to raise them to reflect You. Thank You for this food. In Your precious name. Amen. Amen. Let's eat. No. Aw! Here, give me that baby. Give me that baby. Are you sure? I'll do it. You eat. Hey, that's a sacrifice right there. All right. Hey, buddy. He's all about eating. Shh. You got the magic touch, Godwin. Hey, babe. Yeah. You gotta have moves. Like the bear hug technique. All right. Don't smother him, Godwin.Look. Look. Yep.So... I'm really nervous about the turnout for the walkathon. I think it'll be great. Well, I'm just glad you're in, 'cause I know the family's out of town. And I was so excited that y'all are being a part of this. I'm excited. I mean, it's a subject that's dear to us because of Johanna.Yeah. It is special for us, you know.- She wouldn't be here. I mean, it's something that... I know. You'll make me cry. I mean, we couldn't have children of our own, so... Yep. It's been such a blessing for us to be able to adopt. And... it's good to get it out there about adoption for all these kids that need adoption. But it's not just kids getting a home. It's people like us that couldn't have kids. We're getting a family. We tried for years to get pregnant, and they finally just told us-- The doctor said, "Just stop." I mean, his exact words were: "You two together will never have children." And at first, that was--Wow. That'd be tough.Yeah. It was tough.Yep. When we was talking about all this adoption, I knew Paula really, really wanted to pursue it, but I was like, "I don't know. If it's not mine, I just don't know if I could love it." But when I got to that hospital and seen her, and I was thinking, "We're taking her home," it just-- something just clicked. You know, moms-- It's natural for us to wanna take care of, you know, these kids. But, like, to see a grown man taking a child that maybe wasn't born from them-- it is power to see that connection. I've had people ask me before, "What about your biological mom and your biological dad?" Well, like, this is my mom and dad. These are the people who I ran into the tree with riding my bike for the first time, and who helped me with homework, got me off the bus. I mean, it's the little bitty things that really explain what adoption means to me. Our life would be very, very empty without you. Mom! Let's eat. Let's resort to food, please. I didn't mean to get emotional. But, um, we've been telling everybody, and-- How far is that? What's 5K? What's a K? Just stand there and just high-five people on the way back. I like a no-walkin' walkathon. That's my kind of deal there. Let's name it the Godwin Walk. All right. I'm about stretched out, buddy. This is the last thing. Babe, don't forget. I need you to take all the kids with you today ause I gotta go print out fliers for the walkathon. It's workout day, Jess. I don't wanna be put on babysitting duties, all right? Baby, it's not babysitting when it's your own kids, you ding-dong. It's not gonna hurt you to bring them with you. I don't understand. Yeah, that hurts a lot, because we can't concentrate on the workout. You gotta focus. It's your dojo. You gotta stay in the zone. What does "dojo" mean? "Dojo" is like a Japanese... It's a ninja barn, is what it is. Yeah. It's a barn? Yeah. That's a "dojo"? This is-- This is a Japanese place that-- where they do karate and the different... Japanese... It's a ninja barn. Babe, I cannot watch the baby and the kids and still work out. Kids, y'all wanna go with me and sit at the printer's, or do you wanna go to the ninja barn and work out with Dad? I wanna play on my Xbox. That's not an option. I wanna go work out with Dad. The kids have spoken, babe. Since when did we let the kids decide who gets to go where? Since they agree with their mama. When you're managing, like, five kids, it's a huge responsibility. I'm basically a CEO of a small company. You're a CEO? Babe, moms are always the CEO when it comes to the kids' management. You take Gus, Lily, Merritt, and Priscilla, and I'll take River because he's the biggest handful. I got a tattoo. See? This is what happens under my watch. Babe--They draw on themselves, they go to the bathroom on themselves. I'm not good at it. I do multiple roles. I'm the president of cool, the GM of fun. I'm occasionally a janitor or a groundskeeper. I'm about to dock your pay, buddy. What pay? I don't get paid. Hey, thanks for babysitting "your own kids." Aahh... I'm gonna get you, girl. Bye, guys. I'll see you in a little bit. Love you, baby. Love you. Lily, make sure he doesn't draw on himself anymore. Dad, it's a little late for that. Do it, buddy. Shh. Good. Perfect. Everybody be quiet, okay? Bub, you sit with her and color. We're gonna play the whisper game. If you gotta talk, just whisper, okay? Yeah. That's exactly right. It's pretty simple to take care of the kids. You basically distract them with bells and whistles. You put on a little performance, you give 'em a little song and dance. Next thing you know, they're putty in your hands. Shh! Buddy, be quiet. You just woke him up, okay? Gotta be quiet. Get your own crayon. All you have to do is take care of the basics. You pick up after 'em, take 'em for walks, wipe their butts, give 'em some treats. Babe, you act like you're talking about dogs. I'm not talking about dogs. But River did bite me once. I don't wanna color anymore. Guys, remember, we're playing the quiet game. That's boringOnly if you let it be boring. Okay. New game. Everybody watch. We're gonna do this right here. Quiet. See? What's that mean? We're just throwing-- That's what we're gonna do. Y'all stand up and do it. Soft. Okay.Okay. Now, on this thing, when you go up on this-- Shh! All right, kids. Who you think's better at taking care of you, me or Mommy? Do we answer truthfully? Mom.Mom. Shh. Dad's fun to hang out with... sometimes. Dad, it's not really a game if we're just catching it. Or they're passing it.Okay. Let's play this game. Everybody's having fun now. Mom likes to take us to Shreveport, and then we'll get the best macaroons. And she takes us to get Mexican food too. Shh. We'll get something to eat later. Why does it always revolve around food with you guys? We like food. It's good. This isn't very fun. Not everything has to be fun, okay? Can I turn on the treadmill? No. Just pretend you're walking. You have to learn how to provide for yourself. I'm nine, and he's seven. Exactly. Or I could just call Mom. Merritt, stop hitting me. I'm not touching anybody. Shh, shh. You're waking up the baby. You just pushed me. Stop! Stop! Hey, guy-- Hey, come on, guys! Stop it! Scilla pushed me! Now the baby's awake. Dad, you're not very good at the quiet game. Well, you're not either. You're not gonna win any ribbons today. I don't want any ribbons. I just wanna go home.! Can't bring kids to the gym. That's what I've learned today. Show me your best trick. All right. What's next, dude? Ten pull-ups, ten push-ups. Ding-a-ling ding, ding, ding-a-ling, ding. Let's make a slingshot out of it and throw balls at people. Done. Good. Good. Whoa, kids! We're trying to hit Dan. That was cool, but it's too loud. You shouldn't do that. Shh! Yeah!! Where do you guys get all your energy from anyway? Sugar. There you go. I guess I should eat some more sugar. Kids, come on now. Hey, hey, come on, guys. Coffee works too. But coffee is a natural laxative. If I drank enough to keep up with y'all, I would be pooping all day long. He said "pooping." Hey, guys, calm down. Aah! Lily. Dadgummit. All right, all right, all right, all right. Change of plans. New workout. I got an idea. I got an idea. All right, kids. Come over here. River and Scilla, you're gonna be helping out. Merritt. Yeah! You're gonna be counter. Lily. What are you doing? Babysitting. So here's the plan. We're gonna work out with the kids as, like, body weight. I mean, they're gonna be our weights. Really? Yeah. At least it'll give them something to do, and we can get this done. Here's my parenting technique. Kids get bored easily, right? So you gotta make the boring stuff fun. And you do that by letting them participate. Scilla, you get on Dan's back. River, you're gonna get on my back, and we're gonna do push-ups. So if you're building a fence, tell them to grab a hammer. If you're baking a cake, grab a whisk. Ready, set, go! Go! One! Count it out.Two. And when you're working out, you say, "Hey, kid, come over here. You're gonna be a dumbbell." - Three. Three. Four. - Four. Five. Hey, feel the burn. 13 Jules. 14 Jules. 15 Jules. Aw, good job, buddy! I think incorporating the kids into the workout was a huge success. I am a good babysitter.Father. You're a good father. Same thing. Whatever. Good workout, guys! Yes! I'm gonna be sore. Real sore. You ain't kidding. Hey, guys, how about we get outta here? You deserve it. Let's go. Whoo! We can be loud again! Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. All right, guys. We have a hundred more fliers. We've gotta get these out to people. 'Cause tomorrow's the walkathon, and we want 1,000 people to show up. We don't have that much papers. I know. Well, hopefully, they'll tell other people. Look! Look! Look right here! - Whoo! - Stop the construction man! Go give him one. Go give him one. Go! Come join us! Tell your friends! Take two. Just take two. Take two! Goodness. I think I scared him. Whoo! We're so blessed with, like, the platform we've been given. Godwin will be there. Jep will be there. Y'all bring your friends. I hope Jep doesn't mind I'm advertising for him. There are so many kids out there that are in the foster system, and we definitely want them to be in a forever family. We're having a walkathon! I love your show. Thank you. Come out and support a good cause tomorrow. Hello. We're having a walkathon at Chennault Park. It's for a great cause. We would love for you to come out. Here's a flier for you. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Buddy, this is not ninja training. Well, at least they're getting warmed up for the run tomorrow. I think we should take a break and eat. Go, Team Gus. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. So, how are you feeling today, workout-wise? I am extremely, extremely sore. Yeah? I'm gonna have a problem walking. Pro tip: the last thing you wanna do before you do a walkathon is do a big old workout. Let me tell you something. I am sore. I don't know, brother. Even my face hurts. It really does. Like, I go like this, it's like my neck muscles right here-- It's like, urrr... Quit laughing at me, buddy. Man, this is a pretty special event for all these kids.Yeah. Plus, it just touched us, because, you know, Johanna. It's not just a blessing for the kids, it's a blessing for a parent too. Big time. I would take every one of them home if I could. She would. She would. Not being able to have any at all, and having a blessing getting Johanna. This walkathon is so great because it spotlights children right here in our hometown, in our area, that need a forever family right now. Loving somebody else is something that-- it costs you absolutely nothing, but it pays out more than you can possibly imagine. I mean, you're shaping somebody's life. From the very moment you decide "I'm going to love them," their life is changed. Joey, what's it like being adopted by two of the most awesome people in the world? God knew what He was doing when He put me with them. I couldn't be any more like them than I already am. Well, when we got her, I was like, "Maybe we'll adopt a kid with some legs." Look. She's shorter than us. I'm like, "We can't even adopt legs in this family." I should feel insulted by this, but it is the truth. And I feel blessed knowing that I have these two here loving me more than I could possibly fathom. How come you're holding her hand and you ain't holding mine? Whoo-hoo-hoo. Father, we thank You so much. You've already put in our DNA the adoption process, as You adopted us as Your children. And, Father, I wanna pray a special blessing on everyone here to have a safe race, and to just bless this event and get the awareness out. In His precious name. Amen. Amen. All right. Let's get lined up. Honestly, I think this walkathon has turned out awesome. We got a nice community here. We do. Let's do this thing. It was such a great success. Like, it's so encouraging to know there's that many good people out there that are trying to make an impact in these kids' lives. The only thing that could've been better is if I was in the stroller with him, and you push me. That would've been awesome. Not gonna happen. Never gonna happen. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, don't go too fast. I'm sore. Babe, we have to go. Our kids are way up there. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Walkathon. Y'all are in the lead. Come on. Yeah. "In the lead"! Why are you so sore? We-- Ninja training. You're not a ninja. Just let it go. Y'all the first ones to come by. Y'all doing good. Everybody showed up. They were having a good time. Miss Wanda's probably the funniest lady ever. She is. She's amazing. Come on! Come on! Leave us alone.Yeah. I'm glad she was there so I didn't have to walk fast. Miss Wanda said, "I ain't walking fast. We can stay at the back." And I was like, "Yes, ma'am." She's so cute. "I'm with you." Come on, slowpoke! You do your thing. We gonna do ours. Yeah! You're the first one to come by. You know you're winning. Gotta keep going. Babe, come on! It's embarrassing. Y'all are the first ones to come by. We're the last! I know we're the last! It's really important for us to encourage people to adopt children. Especially after getting baby Gus. It's definitely something that brings a lot of joy. Life has changed. Honestly, it's better. Hey, thanks, guys, for coming out. Thanks, everybody. Here's Jess. I was just gonna say that, um... Gonna make me cry. But, um--Don't cry. She's a cry-- She's a crier. Um, we really are so happy y'all came out in support of this, and, um... Going through this process, it really opened our eyes to a lot of kids in need. And it's really heartbreaking. And we really want to make a difference. Baby Jules is loved by his family. Yeah. And I think, you know, he might've gotten that somewhere in his life, but I know here he's got it for sure. That's kind of all a kid can hope for. Yeah. It's a powerful thing-- love. We want everyone to know that, um, there are all these kids out there that have broken hearts, and they're from broken homes. And, you know, we really just want to spread that word and spread love. Thank you. Here we go. The moment of truth. - Here. - Okay. What's the verdict? I've lost a pound! Hard work pays off. That's what you learn, Baby Jules. Your daddy's so silly. But we love you so much, Baby Jules.
