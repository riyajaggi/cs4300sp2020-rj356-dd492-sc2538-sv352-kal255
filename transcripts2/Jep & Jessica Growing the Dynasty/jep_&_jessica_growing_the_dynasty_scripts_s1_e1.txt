 Whoo! Yay! That stunk. That stunk. Scill, that was terrible. These are our lovely kids. Number five, here we go. I know you guys are wondering why I wanted to speak in person and not on the phone. Don't y'all just up and scream. Y'all ready again? Ready to be Mom and Dad again? Yes! Yes. This past year we started the process of going through the adoption system.

 And just recently we got really close and thought we were going to bring a baby home, and got so excited, and then it fell through, which is just heartbreaking. You know, so often, parents that are trying to adopt-- I mean, you may not get the child the first time, and that can be difficult, you know? And when you really want to adopt, you really want to bring a child into your home, and then you have a failed attempt, it kind of discourages you and make you lose hope on getting that child. So, in knowing this... I have some good news for you guys. A mother just gave birth to a child yesterday. He's a perfectly healthy little boy. Boy. It's a boy. You have to wait five days, you know, before you can bring the child home. So, like, it's, like, for sure, unless she changes her mind within the five days? Right. Like, after the five days, like, she's surrendered it? It's written in stone. Okay. So you guys have five days to get your minds and your heart prepared. It's crazy. Yeah, I know. To bring a-- I'm getting nervous.Yes. I think, like, in the past few years, with Duck Dynasty, our eyes have been open, and we've seen a lot of kids that are in need. Seeing so many kids in orphanages, I think that was a life-changer for Jep-- Yeah....is to see these kids that have nothing. Like, they would get a toothbrush, and they would just, like, cry over that. Or underwear. And I think that knowing that we can make a difference and, you know, take a child in that maybe would never have a mommy or daddy-- it's such a huge blessing that we have the opportunity to do that. You're changing a child's life forever. And he's gonna change our life forever. Well, I'm gonna go and get some paperwork, and we'll get started. That's fine. Thank you, guys, so much. Thank you so much. Like we're getting married.Thanks. I love it. We're all in. It's like a vow. I pledge-- I pledge my love to this baby. I love you. I love you. It's all happening. Okay, guys. I have a surprise. Is this about the baby? It is about the baby. A baby boy was born, and so we possibly are gonna have a baby boy in a few days. Are you excited? A baby brother! OMG! Yes! You're getting a baby brother. Finally, another boy in the house. We need to go over about not sticking their heads in toilets. Of course not. Getting his head, and putting it under your underarms. Don't try that one, River. Why would anybody do that? It happens. Um... River, I think you're gonna be a lot better big brother than what I had, 'cause my big brothers were mean. They tortured me. Are you gonna torture your little baby brother? No. Thank you. But... Well, now you know how I feel, buddy. Atomic wedgies ripped the underwear right off. No. That could, like, scar someone's baby crack. It can do that. You guys have any questions? What's the baby's name? Well, he doesn't have one yet. Y'all wanna help us name him? Sure. What do y'all wanna name the baby? Captain America. Captain America's an awesome name. What about Jack? Boring. Boring. What about Sterlington? Sterlington. That's, like, the next town over. What about Mountains? I don't think you can name a kid Mountains. My name's River. That is true. That's true. I think we should name him Jules. After you. But most people think it's a girl's name. No, they don't. Jep. That's what they tell me. You loved your name growing up, didn't you? No, I hated it. I didn't really like my name when I was a kid because every substitute teacher could not-- or even the new teacher could not say it properly. "Jules"? They'd say, "Jul-es-es"... That's how they said it? "Jep-tha." "Jep-- Jepe-tata"... No.I'm telling you, it was embarrassing, 'cause all the kids are laughing, and I'm embarrassed. This is dumb. Well, people know now. I wanted to be named, like, Eric. I tried to get Jules for every one of the kids, and you said no. Nobody's named Jules. Me and Jules Verne. That's, like, the only... Yeah. That's pretty awesome. I'm thinking Captain America sounds pretty good. Jep. So, I'm glad y'all came over because we have some big news. Um... A baby boy was born, and, um--Yeah? So we'll know, um, hopefully soon, um... if we can get him. My goodness. So, it's just still, like, that nervousness of, you know, will the mom change her mind or not? Yeah. Right. But we're just hoping and praying everything goes all right, and we get him home, and he's ours forever. In Louisiana, the mother has five days to change her mind. And so, waiting for that call to say, "Yes, he's yours," or, "No, she changed her mind," is probably the most excruciating part of the whole process, you know? I just can't imagine, like, getting a call, and her changing her mind. Yeah. It's not something you can, like, guard your heart from. You have to just go all in and love this baby with abandon. I know. So there's just nothing you can do about it. I've been having such anxiety. Jep's trying to, like, calm me down. But, I mean, how can you not? There's really nothing you can do-- I know. I know....but just wait it out, and-- You know, if it happens, it happens, you know? Pray about it and give it to God and know that He is in control. Not us, not the agency. He has control. We're optimistic--Yep. ...that it's gonna happen. So, we'll see. We shall see. So, how did it go with, like, you with Will? Like, that process? Well, with Will, it was a little different because he was with a foster family, so the mother, you know, had already signed away her rights and everything.Okay. But, um, from the moment, like, we found out about him and got him, he was just ours. He's just part of our family--Yeah. ...and there's really no difference. Yeah, your parental instincts will just kick in, and it'll be the same.Yeah. I remember when we found out. Like, we were going to get him. I had contractions. Like, I felt like my body was, like, gonna have a baby. I was so excited. I totally felt, like, contracting or something. I'm not kidding. Luckily, Willie and Korie have been there and done that. And, you know, just seeing them and their love for their kids, and me loving their kids like my own has definitely made an impact on why we wanna adopt. Yeah, ever since Korie and I started dating, we always said we were gonna adopt. And we never knew how it was gonna happen. And the time was right, and... You got a Bobby. Bobby came. We got Will, and then the family keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. To get it from somebody's perspective who's been through it all-- That's right. That's right....is kind of pretty cool. They can walk you through the steps.Yeah. It's so comforting to know that I have so many people around me that I can, like, lean on and ask questions and not feel like this crazy mom. Have you thought about names? Yes.Yes. Willie.Jules. Jules. Aw.We wanted him to be named after Jules. Jules? What kind of name is Jules? This is what I wanna name him-- It's Jep's first name, you ding-dong. That's my name, dude. I love "Jules." Good grief. Well, he wants to name him Jules Augustus. I wanna call him Jules. He wants to call him Gus. So we finally agreed on the name, and it's gonna be Jules. Jules Augustus. Jules after Jep, and Augustus after-- Robert Duvall, Lonesome Dove, Augustus McCrae. It doesn't really matter anyway. In this family, everyone is nicknamed. That's true. Willie used to go by Jess. Jason is Jase now. Jep's actually Jules Jeptha Robertson. And Jules Augustus will go by Gus. Totally makes sense. I'm ready to see him. I know. I can't wait. I can't believe it. Be a future employee. That's what you're thinking of right now? He's gonna be a future employee? Third-generation duck call maker. Every kid we had, I was trying to figure out where they were gonna work in the business. Okay. You can never have enough little Robertsons. All right, bub. You open up the paint can. Yes! Look at your dad. He gonna make it straight-- straight up and down. Wax on, wax off. Wax on, wax off. Bub, since you're gonna be a big brother, we're giving you some bigger responsibilities. Responsibility is when, you know, you gotta man up, step up to the plate. Do you see what I'm saying, River? No. It's taking the bull by the horns. Do you understand what I'm telling you? No. You gotta have cahoonas. You know what that is? Not really? Does he know anything? He's only six, Dad. He's probably about old enough. I need to start training him in the ways of the birds and bees, Jep. Yeah, let's not get into that. I don't know, buddy. He's kind of been out of the parenting game for a while. He doesn't know the new school. The cool school. Let's see it. River, you know what it means to be a big brother? Not really. You gotta provide for everybody. You gotta go out and kill wild game and bring it in for the family, and clean it, cook it. Can you do that yet? No. I can't cook. You can't cook? I never did that before. One of these days, you're gonna have your own kids, River. Are you looking forward to that? Hey, easy, easy. Yep. Yeah. Bub, you know, responsibility also means don't paint your clothes. Yeah, that's right.Yeah. Old River-- he's getting the hang of it there, Jep. There's your manhood. There he stands, right there. He's a ghost. He's not the fastest learner I've ever seen. Well, I mean, he is only six, so... Yep. What's the word? Nothing yet. It's just-- I don't know. I'm just, like, so nervous about it. It is a crazy roller coaster, and I think we're kind of right in the middle of it, so... It just makes me nervous. You just gotta grab on-- Yeah....and scream and have fun. But don't scream. Yeah. Okay. I mean, I can't evenexplain how, like, crazy and nerve-racking it is, and-- It's like you're on a roller coaster, and you go up, and you're like, "Ooh, we're fixin' to do this!"And you're anticipating-- "Yeah!" You just keep anticipating. And then you crest that hill, and you're like, "Crap! But then it goes up again. You know what I'm saying? Because you're still ready for it to come. But just a little. Like, you're ready for it just to happen. And you just keep going up five times. And then, day five, it's like, "Whoooo!" Like that. Okay. I was on a different ride than you, but similar. And I think I threw up on you. Just a little bit. Just a little drop. I mean, I think, like, thinking about that sweet little boy sitting in the hospital. And-- I don't know. Like, nobody holding him or, like, picking him up or swaddling him. That natural instinct-- I mean, all of our kids had it, you know? The moment they came out, you know, it's just cradle them in our arms, and so... I don't know. I just-- I think he needs that. So, it's hard to, like, wait and think-- I don't know. I just-- I'm so ready to have a little one... Just hold him. to, you know, share all of our love with. Makes me nervous. I love you. It's gonna work out, baby. I hope so.Yep. It makes me feel better that you're confident, so... But, I mean-- Here. Come here, baby. Give me a hug. I love you. I've been trying to keep my mind off the baby, but it's pretty much impossible. I mean, I go to the soccer game. There's babies there. I go to the mall, and there's babies there. There's a lot of babies in this town. This is a baby-making town. I guess everybody's just bored as crap, so they just keep having kids. Seriously. Aside from that bowling alley that burned down, there's nothing else to do. I think this is a good time to make a little video for the baby. His daddy and his mommy. What's up, baby? We-- We are making your bed. Hey, baby Jules! Okay. It's my video. What? Willie gave us the bright idea of making some video diaries for the baby. 'Cause he did that with Will, and he still asks about them today. Yeah. So we've decided to make some videos. I think it'll be pretty special. I think he's gonna really love to look at how much we loved him. And just to actually, one day, hand him these videos, and, you know, look at a young Jep and Jess, Mom and Dad, and laugh about it one day, and see how cheesy their daddy was and how awesome their mom was, right? So, um, as you can see, we got your crib laid out. Check it out. Oooohh! This is where the magic happens. The magic for sleeping? Yeah.Yeah. He's too little. What are you talking about? Cool, bud. We're gonna put some wallpaper up. Um, get it all slicked up for you. Can't wait to see you. Sleep tight, bud. He's gonna be lucky to have you as a daddy. All right. Let's go eat. Let's take a break. Yes. Good idea. Let me get my phone. Has anybody told you today, you look just like Rosie the Riveter? Jep. But you're much hotter. All right. Here's the rest of the family. Hey, y'all. Another video. I got the baby bag. It's gonna be awesome. We should've done this with the other kids. All right, Jess. Tell the baby what you're doing. We are making you a mobile to put above your bed. A mobile? Wait. It's a baby mobile. It goes above their beds, so when they're laying there, they can look at it. Sometimes it plays music, but, like, this one won't. Sometimes you have, like, streamers. Sometimes you have stars.Boring. Jep. Scill, what do you think about it? You're writing your name on there? Yeah, they're gonna write their name. I can't, though. You can't write your name? Baby, you're nine years old.Yeah. In paint. Well, that's the baby bag. Done. Why are you bringing your computer? Because I want to bring my computer. There's no time to even play your game while you're there. There's always time, babe. What else is in that bag? Avocados. 'Cause I like 'em. Diapers. Wipes.Perfect. Diapers and wipes are good. Did you get more than one diaper? I got two. No. We need more. We need, like, ten. Protein bars. I got-- In case you needed to change, I got you a little bra. Jep! My favorite one. Put that up. And I got the baby a toy. You can do just the laser part. You got a pretty mouth, girl. â™ª I wanna kiss you right there â™ª â™ª And on your neck - What is wrong with your dad? Babe, we just need to keep it to minimal. Diapers, wipes, butt paste, and-- "Butt paste"? She just said "butt paste." I'm definitely nesting. It's like when the mommy hen's getting everything ready for her baby, and she's been sitting on that egg for a long time, and it starts to hatch, you know? Yeah, but you're not a chicken, so... I guess more than anything, it's just preparing your heart and your mind and your soul for this new little being coming into your lives. A woman prepares for a baby by just going flat-out nuts. She goes crazy. She's running around the house. She's doing stuff that don't need to be done.Jep. Just-- Basically, just going crazy. What are you saying? I'm saying you've been going crazy. I have not been going crazy. You've been acting nuttier than a squirrel turd. Disgusting. Who even says that? Never heard of that. I hear it all the time. Have you heard anything from the adoption agency? I haven't, babe. I'm just trying to stay optimistic, you know? Yeah. Well, maybe we should just say a prayer. Yeah, I think that'd be a good idea. That would be awesome. Calm everybody down. Scilla, you wanna say a prayer for us? For the baby. Wanna say a prayer? Dear God, thank You for this day. Thank You for creating us. And please help us to get the baby. In Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Scill. Thank you, Priscilla. That makes me feel so much better. I feel better already. I know it. Hey, let's go. Come on. Come on, guys! We gotta go! We're gonna be late. Hurry up. I'm trying, babe. Slow down. Don't fall. Hey, kiddos. Come on. You ready to be a soccer ninja? Yeah. Hello? Boy. Okay. Yes. Come on, soccer mom. Are you serious? Y'all ready for your game? Yes. You gotta get your game face on, son. You gotta get mean.Okay. Thank you. We will-- We will be on our way. Mommy, hurry! That was her. The baby's ours. We're getting the baby right now, so no game. Okay. Here we go. Y'all wait here. I gotta get the car seat. We're on our way to the soccer game, and we get the call-- like, thecall. And it's the most amazing, scared feeling seeing that number come up on my phone, but also the most exhilarating moment of the past nine months, basically. Don't forget my butt paste! Come on. Come on. Not good. To hear the words, like, "He's your son" -- it's pretty awesome, you know? Just to... Don't do it. Don't do it. Hold it back. Fight it. Fight it. Just to know that he's gonna be a part of this family, and we're gonna get to hug on him and squeeze on him and love him, you know, for the rest of his life... It's a pretty awesome moment. I'm gonna be his mommy. You're gonna be his daddy. I love you. All right. Whoo-hoo! Video diary time. Buckle up. What's up? We're coming. Y'all say "hey." Hey! Give it to me. You just drive. I'll do it. There's Daddy. He's driving. Whoo! Whoo! We're going to get you. Whoo! We ready to get a baby? Yay! Did you get the diaper bag? No. Jep! Good grief.Dadgummit. I asked you to get one thing. I forgot one thing. We're coming. We really are coming. We just gotta go back and get your diaper bag. Do you know where it is? I think so. Okay. Grab it. Y'all ready to meet your new baby brother? Yeah. Can we make a cake? Yes, we can make a cake when we get back for celebrating him coming home, okay? Can we put tons of sprinkles on it? Yes, we can put sprinkles on I okay? Thank you. Thank you. Awesome. All right, guys. All right. Here we go. We ready to get our brother? Did you get your butt paste? Yes, bud, I got the butt paste. Hey, buddy. We've been waiting for this, I guess, your whole life. Love ya. Cannot wait to meet ya. We can't wait to wrap our arms around you. It's gonna be so awesome, man. We're gonna teach you how to play soccer. Whoo-cha! What do you have to say your new little baby brother? Hi.Is that it? Rock and roll! We can't wait to see you. Bye. Bye, buddy.
