 Welcome to the kid's cafe. Ooh, is this a little hors d'oeuvre? Yeah. Chips and pretzels. You know I'm going Paleo right now. I don't know what that means, so... Well, it means I can't eat chips and pretzels. Well, who cares? Excuse me, waitress. Yeah, I don't want that. Who cares? Bub, is there nothing else to eat here? I don't know. You don't know? We have water. I'll take some water. Thank you.

 Go give this to Daddy and say it's our menu. This is our menu. Do you always serve it with your finger inside the cup? No. Hey, guys. Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. Come get some delicious food. What are y'all doing? We're playing restaurant. This water tastes like fingers. Look how cute this is. Little pricey. I definitely think as parents you want to give your kids what you didn't have in your childhood. Bub mentioned he wants a-- he wants a treehouse. I'm 100% for that.

 I built my own treehouse growing up. It was a little... rickety. Yeah. Janky? Yeah. I do like the idea of a treehouse for the kids, but I think a little struggle every now and again builds character. Like when I was a kid, we spent tons of hours building our own treehouses, really doing it the way we wanted. Nowadays, you just get these prefab treehouses and it's like, meh. Well, I don't want you to build it. FYI. You're not a builder. What are you trying to say? I just said it, you're not a builder. But in the end, if it gives me and Jess some alone time, I'm all for a treehouse. 'Cause there are kids everywhere. Bub, I'm trying to do an interview here. If we get them out of the house, there will be less TV watchin', less game playin'...More Mommy-Daddy time. And it would give them something to do outside in nature. That would be awesome. Let's do it. Treehouse for the win.Treehouse. Kids, come here. We got something to tell ya. Come here, Mr. Maître d'.We have another dessert. It's called "Melted Nerds." Ooh, Melted Nerds. Yeah, I'm not gonna partake in that. All right, we have some news to tell y'all. What would you guys think about us building y'all a treehouse? Yeah, do you like it? Yes! And you can serve us food up there. And you can get out of Mom and Daddy's hair. Yay! This is the tree. Keep digging. What is that? Creatine. Well, it stinks. Creatine makes you have muscles. When you have big muscles, you can do this. Do you want big muscles? You got little, scrawny muscles. I'm talking about big muscles. But first, you have to become familiar with this baby right here. This is my new high-powered blender. This thing can blend anything. You could put a deer antler in here, and it'd blend it up, which is actually good for you.Eww. This blender is awesome. If I had to compare it to like a TV, this is 5K. Crazy definition. If I had to compare it to a car, this is a 'Vette slash Viper. Imagine a 5K television combined with a Corvette, that's how awesome this blender is. Do you realize the RPMs on this thing? What is an "RPM"? I'm not sure what it exactly stands for, but this one has a lot of it. You know what I'm sayin'? It will take your hand off. Or your face. This blender is like my baby. Dad, I thought we were your babies. You are my babies. But this blender is also my other baby. That's rude. But we have a real baby. We do. We have two real babies. Baby Gus and Baby XR-5000. XR-5000. You wanna hear the power? Wait, how do you turn this thing on? There's-- There it is. Thing's spinnin' fast. This thing can blend emotional intelligence with spiritual enlightenment. You know what I'm sayin', kids? Exactly. You may ask, why would you get a high-powered blender? It's because I'm on the Paleo diet. You know what that is? I eat what a caveman eats. Guys, I'm gonna make us a healthy smoothie. Do you guys think you need to eat healthy food? Can we put candy in it? I mean, you could, but why, buddy? This is a healthy meal replacement. Healthy stuff is gross 'cause it doesn't have any sugar in it. Can we use the blender to play restaurant? Only if I'm there to supervise. And sugar is the best tasting thing in the world. This is a dangerous piece of equipment. We're not stupid. So everybody keep your hands off my man-tool. I'm a man. No, you're not a man yet, buddy. I don't think so. Sugar cubes... All right, here's the moment of truth. One, two, three. Everybody try it. It's a little funky tastin', but it's good. Barf. The first bite's not good, but once you get past that, it gets pretty good. Who wants another smoothie? I don't. It's gonna be so cool. Okay, we need some ice. Now get some cookie dough! Okay. Are you sure Dad's not gonna be mad, Lil? No, Dad's not gonna be mad. Dad's gonna love this smoothie. Dump it, Lil. Dump it, dump it, dump it. Candy. Let's go get some candy! Wait. No, not the wrapper! Okay! Chunky? I think our masterpiece is ready. What in the world are you doin'? Okay. I think our masterpiece is ready. What in the world are you doin'? It looks like throwup all on the side. I mean, my floor... Did you all ruin my blender? No, no, no, no, no. No! Turn it off. Priscilla, that floor is gonna be so sticky. Y'all have a huge mess to clean up. Are those my hand towels you're using? You're gonna have to rinse 'em out. You guys are in big trouble. River, stop hiding behind the door. You come out here too. You were involved. Lily, you are 13 years old. You shoulda known that we wouldn't want you to do this. What did I tell you about using the blender? I said don't do it. If you want a smoothie, just ask me. I'll make you a smoothie. But your smoothie--I can make different kinds. I woulda made it a little better like y'all like it, but not like this. That looks terrible. - It's good. - It's actually pretty good. I wouldn't feed that to a hog. It's good. It's got eggs, it has some candy. It has like some Coke soda. It has some-- I don't care what's in it. You are not supposed to use my blender. So you broke the rules, so there will be consequences. It's definitely hard for me to stay mad at our kids. I mean, they're just so stinkin' cute. And when they smile at me and flash those little dimples, how could I ever be mad at River? I was gonna tear up something he really liked. If I had done this when I was y'all's age, I probably woulda got a wooden spoon cracked over my head. I definitely think I'm the tougher one. See, I know you're lying now. No, I'm not. I-I really do think that I'm the tougher one. They're scared when they get in trouble and they come talk to me. With you, they laugh. They don't laugh. They laugh. No, they don't laugh. They snicker. Jess, you are a softy. You know it. I am not a softy. You're a plushie. Honestly, if it was me, I'd make you drink that whole thing. No. That'll make you sick. Yeah, well... All right, get to cleanin' up. We're gonna go meet and see what your consequences are. Better be spotless, you hear me? Spotless. I cannot believe they did that. I know. I just told 'em don't mess with my new blender. Well, babe, I don't understand why you left your blender out. That's not my fault. The kids got into it. You wouldn't leave your keys in your car. I do leave my keys in my car. That don't mean they should get in there and drive it off. So what are we gonna do? I know one thing's for sure, no treehouse. I think that's a little too much. And I already put money down on it. How much money? That's not the issue. They directly disobeyed me. Well, we can punish them some other way. Jess, you're being too soft on them. That's the problem. Babe, I'm not soft. Jess, you are soft serve. They need some punishment right now. They need to learn. Babe, you're being a little too hard on them. Jess, when I was a kid, if I broke something of my dad's, that was an automatic belt whupping. But babe, we're not your parents. Mom used to smack the crap out of us with a wooden spoon if we did dumb stuff like this. Did it stop you from doing dumb stuff? Um, not really. But I don't like wooden spoons anymore. Well, what do you suggest? Take them to my dad's. Do work on the land. He's moving dirt to build a levee. Just have them out there with shovels. Babe, River's seven years old, he can't move tons of dirt. I worked on a lot of duck blinds. I'm a little scarred from some of that stuff I did. I didn't really get in trouble a whole lot, growing up. You were one of those perfect attendance nerds? Yes, I cried. I like, got a crick in my neck one morning, and my mom made me go to the doctor and get a shot, and I had to miss school and I cried and cried. And I was like, it ruined my perfect attendance that year. I would fake that my neck was turned like that just so I didn't have to go to school. I'd be walkin' around... Well, what if I took them to Si's? There's plenty of stuff to be done there, and he doesn't ever do anything anyway, so it'd be helping him out. I don't know. Is that safe? I don't know. I mean, we'd be there. I'd be there, it's fine. Jep, I don't want my kids permanently scarred. I don't think it will permanently scar them. At least not physically. Okay, we'll take them to Si's, I guess. All right, let's go tell them. All right, kids. We got somethin' for you. Here's the deal. You're not getting a playhouse right now. The only way you can get it is you're gonna have to earn it. This was dis-earning it. It's over. You've been sentenced to hard labor. You do the crime, you gonna do the time.Yup. That's how it works in this house. You're like fluffy pillows. All right, you knuckleheaded privates. Y'all are in trouble. All four of you. Gus, you're all right. I've heard that y'all have been misbehavin'. Bunch of misfit privates. Here's the rule in my house. Don't touch it! 'Cause look, in my army, a private has no rights. You see that over there? That's a microwave. Don't let me see you touch it. You see that? Refrigerator. Don't touch it! The kids might think we went too far by sending them to Si's house, but this is what tough love looks like. I mean-- I don't know. River, you and Priscilla, y'all are gonna be outside raking leaves. And look, you gotta be careful where you step. 'Cause my next door neighbor's dog uses my yard as his toilet. Eww. You let the dog just crap in your yard? Yeah, I let him. I encourage him to. It's free fertilizer. Do we have to rake doo-doo? Ooh. That's a little too much, Si. I mean, come on. Yeah, you have to rake that. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Jess, there's a reason it's called punishment and not "funishment." Lily, Merritt. You two are gonna give my cat, Sweetpea, a bath. Cat bathing. I don't think that's a good idea. Cats hate baths. They're gonna scratch--He'll be all right. I think this punishment's a little too rough for kids. Really, what he's having them doin' is not that hard. I think it's pretty harsh. You're soft. Babe, I mean I don't know. I think it's pretty harsh. Now we're talkin' about poop and cat claws and-- It could be dangerous. Quit being a softie. You do the crime, you do the time. That's it. If you smelt it, you dealt it. I don't think that applies here. Yeah, it applies. Do we have to do this? It's this or no treehouse. Treehouse? Treehouse. Y'all are gettin' them a treehouse? Yeah, we were. No, hey, look, I'm tellin' you. Don't do that. I fell out of one when I was a kid and landed on my head. How did you fall out? I don't remember, but I never was the same afterwards. That explains a lot. No, no, look. The last thing you want to have for that bunch is a treehouse. All right, well, maybe we should just get a playhouse instead of a treehouse. Whatever, let's just get this punishment going, and then we'll talk about treehouses and playhouses. Let me go get the gloves for the girls, and get the cat. Cilla and River, we're going out back to rake leaves. Y'all are in the yard, rakin' leaves. I still don't know about this. Do we know why we're rakin' leaves? Cause we broke the blender. That's right, 'cause you broke the blender. River, why are we rakin' leaves? 'Cause we broke the brender.Okay. There you go. All right, this time, say it together. Why are we rakin' leaves? 'Cause we broke the blender! We broke the blender, sir! Eww, there's poop! Sweep it up with a leaf. You gotta spread fertilizer. I think Si's army training and his just, knowledge of discipline are exactly what these kids need right now. I mean, they're just kids. They're not in the army. Look at all the leaves you left. Well... I would show you, but I got a bad back. All right, Si, don't micromanage them too much now. What do ya mean? They can't get every leaf. No, they must get every leaf. Did y'all hear that, you private? Every leaf! You're doing good, kids. Do not leave one on the ground. Keep doin' what you're doin', you're doin' good. You know how they say in the military, "You either shape up, or ship out." Where are they gonna ship out to? We're not shipping out our kids somewhere. They're gonna learn or they're gonna-- Well, not burn. That seems-- Jep, you are taking this to the extreme. You're gonna... It's not funny. Keep goin'. What are you doin'? What? Don't blow their pile. Si, don't blow the pile! Don't blow the pile! What? Stop! Stop! I can't hear ya. Yeah, you can! No, I can't hear ya. Stop! No, stop! Si! What are ya doin'? Stop. Si, turn off the leaf blower! I can't hear ya through the leaf blower! Turn off the leaf blower! I can't hear ya through the leaf blower! I know, turn it off. Turn it off. What's wrong with y'all? They ain't learned nothin' yet. Si, why are you doin' that with the blower? It builds character. No, it doesn't. That's just cruel and unusual. No, nah. Cruel and unusual? Yeah. No, son, don't go soft on me. This lesson's hard enough, just let them rake leaves. All right, guys. Come on. Y'all ready to go to the backyard? I'll go get Lily and Merritt set up for Sweetpea. Y'all take care of business. All right, look here. Who's ready to wash the cat? Lily. No.Lily. Look, y'all gotta wash this cat. He stinks. I think you're gonna have to get it started. 'Cause I don't want that crazy wild cat to turn around and start clawin' their face. - Look at him. - Does this look like a crazy wild cat? Those eyes are scary, yes. Have you looked in that cat's eyes? Yeah, I look at him. He wakes me up every mornin'. I'm gonna put him in the sink. Then we're gonna turn on the water. - Come back, hey! - Catch him, catch him. God! He's hissin'.Catch him. Look, the cat thing is not workin' out. So, you gonna let the kids off? I think we should show a little grace and let them off the hook this one time. No, I ain't gonna let them off the hook. We can do something different. So what are you guys learnin' from Si's punishments? Not to mess with the blender. To obey your parents. What else? We learned how it's important to-- clean your bathroom. Here's your toothbrush. All right, from the floor to the ceiling. And do not use Si's toothbrushes.True. We can't clean this whole bathroom with just these toothbrushes. Yes, you can. I used to do it, private. But, before you do, ease out. I gotta take care of some business. Eww. Gross. Fire in the hole! Gross. - There's a hair. - That's a beard hair. Dad, I'm really hungry and I'ld. They're cold and really hungry. I'm cold and hungry. I'm ready to go home. The maggots are in mutiny! I think they're about done, Si. Pitiful. Hey, guys. Y'all don't know what cold is. Dude, it's-it's chilly. It's cold out here. I know, it's so cold. Bunch of wimps. Being grounded is actually probably way better than what Mom and Dad had us do. Or Uncle Si had us do. Way better. Did he leave a prize in there for you? Eww! Good grief! Way better. I think the whole world could agree with us on that one. The whole world. That's disgusting! Eww. Don't get that anywhere near your face. That's disgusting. I don't think he's cleaned this in 10 years. Gross! I would rather change 100 of Gus' poo-poo diapers-- Eww! Than go and clean Si's bathroom. It's clean, look. I'll be the judge of that. Gimme that. These leaves is takin' forever. Gimme that. And they're about worn out. I say we let them off the hook. I agree. It's way too cold. What kind of message you gonna send to them doing that? They started a job, they need to finish it. They worked really hard and your bathroom is spic-and-span. Look, I don't care if you call me a big softie. It's time to end this. All right? Agreed. Well, hey, bring them over next week, cause I got a leak in the roof. Nobody got time for that. Hey! Si. Look at that sweet face. She's a fluffy pillow. I was gonna turn them into concrete, but nope. They still fluffy pillows. I think our kids learned a lesson today. And I actually think we did too. I mean, it's really good that we're both so extremes in our parenting, that way when we come together, we balance each other out. It's the ultimate balance. Yin. Yang. Pew! Boom. All right, you're off the hook. You're gonna get a treehouse. Treehouse? Whoo! They don't need a treehouse. I done told you what happened there. Don't fall out of it, kids. Well, maybe a playhouse. They gonna fall out of it. Playhouse. Yeah, maybe a playhouse. Aren't you all excited? I'm cold. Pathetic. Si, you did good. That's pathetic. You did taught them some life lessons. Pitiful. All right, kids. Come on. Let's get outta here. I love you. I hope they learned their lesson. They're still fluffy pillows. They're coming, they're coming, they're coming. No, they're coming. Hello. Is this our menu? Welcome to the Rainbow Cafe, my name is Priscilla. Where should I sit? You sit over on the pink chair, and then Daddy sits on the green chair. Hello, Lily. Do you like our decorations? "No shoes, no shirt, no service." Those are the rules. I'm still bummed I didn't do it myself. We need a kitchen, is what we need. Yeah, that's probably a little too much trouble, there. We need a refrigerator. And an ice maker. We need a blender too. Bud... Did you not learn anything? Do you want to go to Uncle Si's again? No! Well, good. His cat smells gross. I think we have great kids. Do they mess up sometimes, sure. They are great kids. But after the blender incident, I think it's best we keep them on ground level. True that. Good meal, guys. Thank y'all. We just bought this thing. You got change for a 20? And don't forget to leave a tip. Thirty dollars is okay. Cilla, make sure you give me a cut of that. How about a hug? Hugs are half off today, but usually they're 100 bucks. That must be one awesome hug. All right, guys. Come here. I need to talk to each and every one of y'all. Come here, we gotta tell you something important. Come here. Huddle up, come here. I'm not paying for this hug. All right. We're out of here. Y'all clean this mess up. All right, guys. I'm gonna give you a good review online. All right? Hey. Hey. Y'all tired? A long day of work over at Uncle Si's house. Y'all tell Gus what you learned. Don't touch Dad's blender? Yup. Don't go to Uncle Si's.Exactly. Daddy, what did you learn? I learned, is Uncle Si crazy? The answer is yes. He is very crazy. Gus, we love you, buddy.
