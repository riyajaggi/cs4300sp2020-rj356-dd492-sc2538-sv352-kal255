 Space: 1999 (1975â€“1977): Season 2, Episode 13 - Catacombs of the Moon - full transcript 
 Ship's engineer Tony Osgood believes he can obtain titanium, to make a new heart for his sick wife Michelle, from the catacombs of the moon, using dynamite. The explosion which follows gives him a vision of the future in which the ship is pursued by a fireball and this comes true. Though Helena is making a new heart for Michelle, Osgood becomes impatient and drags his wife back into the catacombs, giving Koenig a double task - to avoid the fireball and save the Osgoods.

 I want one last series of deep charges placed here, here and here. I know we'll find it this time. - More? That's a bit risky, chief. - Our job is to find tiranium. - It's a treacherous rock formation. - So are they all! It's enough explosive to hollow out the moon. Then our job should be done. We don't share your enthusiasm for dangerous short cuts. You lack faith in my judgement? I'll set the charges myself. Look, you're the expert... When I want your advice, don't I ask for it? Then I've said nothing.

 He's not himself any more. Yeah, well, if your wife was dying, you wouldn't be yourself, either. (Silent) (Silent) (Helena) 'Moonbase Alpha status report. '1,196 days since leaving Earth's orbit. 'Dr Helena Russell recording. 'Michelle Osgood, a very special patient with a very special problem. 'She needs a new heart or she will die. 'And in the catacombs, our search for tiranium - 'a scarce metal essential for medical uses 'and a vital component of our life-support systems - 'continues to have top priority. 'The Chief Engineer is Patrick Osgood, husband of the dying patient,

 'a man who has had recurrent visions 'of Alpha being destroyed by a raging fire.' - How long has it been? - Just a few minutes. Tiranium? (Whirring) - Not yet. - And not ever! Anything? Soon, Michelle. We're testing a new heart for you. Dr Russell, it's so... boring to die slowly. There's hope, Michelle. There's always hope. I do believe you. I'll see my wife NOW, if you please! I want to be alone with my wife. There's no need for that. - It's a scratch. - Patrick, you're hurt. - What happened? - A revelation. - I've seen the future for us all. - Patrick... - A storm of fire will destroy Alpha. - No... Only we can be saved. If you have the will, if you have the faith to live, I can save you. But you must have faith. Patrick... (Helena) 'Moonbase Alpha status report - supplemental. 'Waves of unbearable heat have begun to beat against Alpha. 'Our sensors are unable to pinpoint their source. 'Commander Koenig has lifted off in Eagle 1 to investigate. 'The incredible coincidence is that Osgood predicted this occurrence.' Surface temperature now 40 degrees centigrade and rising rapidly. That's uncanny. A 20 degree rise in 20 minutes? - And still rising. - Can't you pinpoint the source? It's out there somewhere. All computer print-outs show is... I don't need a computer to tell me it's getting hotter. We need specifics. I need to know why and where it's coming from! The commander is trying to get visual contact with the source! Yeah. I'm sorry. Where's Maya? She's trying to squeeze power out of the air conditioning. OK, well, let's try to relax. I suggest all the fellas and especially the ladies try to cool off. Impossible to solve. Why won't you accept it? Cos the solution has got to be simple, applied science. This is the artificial heart perfected by Dorfman in 1987. (Man) Too bad we don't have one. This is our version, Michelle's new heart. (Man) New heart number ten, huh? We've used Dorfman's exact specifications. It's got to work this time. Not without tiranium to coat the valves. - This time... pray. - We tried everything else. Do you want the blood-flow test first or will we build up our hopes? Look, being cynical won't help. It helps keeps the mind clear of personal emotions. All right, let's do our final check. We're ready to test. Then I'm just in time to witness your success. - Patrick, we are trying. - And you keep failing. We've solved the friction problem by relieving the initial pressure. You solve every problem except the basic one. - I wish you had more faith in me. - I have a different faith. A knowledge of what is to be and what is not to be. Must we have him here? At least we know where he is and what he's up to. All right. Let's make it work this time. (High-pitched beeping) (Pitch increases) (Sizzling) Blasphemy! You scientists think you can give the gift of life. We're Michelle's only hope. Your science, your advanced quackery is no substitute for true faith. Only faith can outface death! - We should put him under restraint. - Why? Wouldn't you say he was slightly off-balance? When he was having visions about Alpha being destroyed by fire, yes. Now we seem to be in the middle of a heat wave, I don't know, Doctor. OK. What now? - We try again. - Again?! Again... and again. (Michelle) 'I wish you'd accept death as I do.' (Patrick) 'No, Michelle. The spirit lives forever.' (Michelle) 'Think in the past, Patrick. Come there with me. 'It's easier when you do.' (Patrick) 'Where is your faith, Michelle?' (Michelle) 'My faith is in our love. 'We've lived such a beautiful, intense life together. So lucky. 'Now we must let it go.' Rise up, Michelle. Rise up. Sir, please go now. She can't hear you when she's under sedation. - No. - For your sake, if not for hers. (Patrick) 'I have a plan to save you.' Any new facts? New readings? New anything? 'Nothing. The temperature just keeps rising.' How about tempers? No tantrums yet. Have you found out anything? 'No, nothing.' If the situation goes critical, I suggest we evacuate non-essential personnel and get them down below. - 'You're in command, Tony.' - Check. John, I've got a life-and-death medical problem. - Yes, Helena. - 'Michelle Osgood. 'I've tried everything. Unless you release some tiranium...' - We've none to spare. - Just a few grains. 'We have a total emergency on our hands and tiranium is irreplaceable.' So is Michelle Osgood's life. - Helena, normally I'd take the risk. - 'But...' I'm sorry, but it's one life against hundreds and I can't jeopardise Alpha. You'll find another way. 'I'm glad you have such tremendous faith in me.' I wish you luck, Helena. Eagle 1 out. (Tony) Extreme heat can set off the explosives, so move them down to level D fast. Load up that trolley. Breathe easy, walk lightly. Handle that stuff VERY carefully. How are we? Under control? Well, don't anybody sneeze too loud. You always give me such a great sense of security(!) I want a word with you, Tony. Yeah. Sure, Pat, but don't make waves in here. Things are touch and go. Come on, let's talk privately. Right here. Pat, I'm sorry about Michelle. I wish we had found tiranium in the catacombs. But we didn't, did we? Helena is doing everything medically possible. Don't apologise for her scientific failures. I have good news. There will be salvation for my wife. - How? - I am her salvation. Pat, is that what you came storming in here to tell me? Listen. I have supreme knowledge. Only faith can give life. Only faith can triumph over death. Only faith, huh? You go ahead, you mock me, Tony. You haven't the power of faith. Mock you? Come on, Pat, it's me. I was best man at your wedding. Now, if I didn't have faith... Possibly, you may live long enough to see Michelle cured. - Then again, you may not live. - Come on, Pat. What you're saying... If you stay on Alpha, you most certainly will die with the rest. I congratulate you at least on not fleeing in the face of catastrophe. - Fleeing?! - Running away, like the commander. Pat, I know what you're going through and I know how much it hurts, but nobody is running away from anything, least of all the commander. He might've remembered Noah's Ark and taken on board... Patrick, old buddy, the commander is trying to find out what's causing the high temperatures. I have the answer. I've seen the holocaust. I've seen Alpha in flames! - I know. You predicted this. - I had a true vision. There are all kinds of visions, Pat. Why don't you talk to Helena? - You were my friend, Tony. - Correction. I AM your friend. You think I'm strange because I say Alpha will be destroyed. Not Michelle. I'm taking her with me. All right, all right. Let's talk about it. There is no talk, only visions. Let's talk about visions, then. Come on. I'll go with you to Helena. Pat, there are explosives in there! (Struggling) Pat! (Alarm sounds) If he shows, hold him, but no unnecessary force. - Michelle. - Where is he, Tony? Is something wrong? Is that why you're here? When I last saw him, he was fine. (Michelle) They say he's become dangerous. Oh, you know Patrick - a regular bull in a china shop. He married you, didn't he? Swept you right off your feet. If he hadn't, I would've. Pat said terrible things were going to happen to Alpha. Well, we'll see that they don't. Trust us. The important thing now is getting you well. I just keep worrying about him. Stop worrying. The moment he knows you're fine, he'll be fine. - That's a promise. - Right. Now, come on, it's time for you to rest, Michelle. OK? Hmm? - How's it coming? - We're trying number 11. I thought that was impossible without tiranium. We're trying an alloy Dorfman used before perfecting the tiranium wall. - You mean it worked for him? - Sometimes... for short durations. Good luck, especially for her. The best luck for her would be if someone finds some tiranium. (Tony) Yeah. Helena, we had a scramble with Osgood in the explosives room. He was hungry for a fight, hitting everything. Now, he may be on his way down here, OK? Wait a minute! What was he doing in the explosives room? (Man) 'Yes, Security.' Explosive rooms in B, C and D levels are off limits, especially to Pat Osgood. I love this heat wave! How can we go back to uniforms again? Nobody'll give us a second look. (Bleeping) Area 3, living quarters, get Security. Security, Area 3, living quarters. (Tony) Get a stretcher. (Silent) (Silent) (Helena) OK. Like they used to say in old-time show business, "One more time." (High-pitched beeping) (Pitch wavers and falters) (Sizzling) Yeah. Like they used to say in old-time hospital wards, "The operation was a success, but we lost the patient." Yeah, but this time, no workable heart, no operation. Well, we've tried everything. - Except tiranium. - What do we do now? I don't know. One thing I don't want to do right now is face Michelle. Not right now. Helena, we've got Osgood. Emergency reception. - How is he? - He's lost a lot of blood. When the fire comes, flee to the catacombs. Lie back. There's no fire. - You'll be safe in the catacombs. - Another vision, Pat? You must believe me! - Dr Russell... - Antiseptic. Dr Russell... if you look closely, you'll find I've wired myself as a human explosive. Listen, Pat, this is no time for games. Come closer to me. See what happens. May I examine you? Carefully. Patrick, you've lost a lot of blood. It may require surgery. No. Bandage my arm and then you'll take me to my wife. She's waiting. - Pat, you can't! - Easy, Tony, old buddy. Any sudden move, I could lose my grip on this firing pin. Tony, please. It's wrong, what you're doing, Pat. All wrong. All right. Help me bandage this arm. - Hey, what a cloud! - No need to state the obvious. (Fraser) Where did it come from? (Koenig) Maybe from whatever's causing the heat. (Fraser) We can't tell from here. I want to know what's on the other side. - Patrick, please don't do this. - She is mine to do with, not yours. She's not yours to kill. I can save her. The only thing that can save her is a new heart. - How many have you tried? - None with tiranium. Look, I'll get some. If John were here, he'd release it. He would not risk Michelle being killed. I'd blow myself up before I'd hurt her. She has a chance here. You both have. Please don't take her. I am her only chance. You couldn't save her with your medical science, but my faith can. (Patrick) Come, Michelle. She's sedated. She can't hear you. Patrick? Will you come with me? Yes. It's all right. We're going a long way, but we'll be together. I love you. I told you. She's mine. (Tony on PA) 'Approach with extreme caution. He is wired with explosives. 'If spotted, don't crowd him. Stay clear and report his location. 'Repeat, just report his location.' External heat rising. Glare shield! (Whirring) There's our heat wave, Bill. Wow! Talk about Dante's Inferno. Computerise its course. Collision course Alpha. And, Commander, it's enormous. - Speed? - Faster than our maximum speed. 'Eagle 1 to Alpha. Firestorm is in a direct line for Alpha, ETA 1100. 'Batten down your hatches.' 'And how about a tall, cool drink waiting for us, Alpha? 'Tony, I'd even settle for a beer.' - John, listen to me. - 'Helena, I know what I'm...' (Static crackles) We've lost him. 'Tony, we've found Michelle's nameplate. 'They're in the catacombs, somewhere.' All right. Put Alpha on emergency status. Full alert. Firefighters, extra crews at explosives building. Helena, casualty stations. Peter, all non-essential equipment shut down right now. - What about Michelle and Osgood? - I'm going down after them. - John may have let me have tiranium. - He was cut off. We don't know that. Then a determination has to be made. You're in command now. Yeah. Well, we may all go up in smoke anyway. Take what you need. We've got a head start. Let's see if we can outrun it. (Michelle breathes heavily) Patrick... (Patrick) Hold on to me. - I'm so tired. - We'll rest here. - Please don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid when I'm with you. - I know you love me. - Yes, always. Wasn't there any hope for me in hospital? None at all. - Dr Russell tried so very hard. - She failed utterly. You know best, Patrick. (Footsteps) - Are you able to walk now? - Not yet. Shh! I'm sorry, my darling, but we must go on. I'll try. Patrick! We're nearly safe, where the fire won't find us. - Too hard. I must stop. - Try to go on. Michelle! Can you hear me, Michelle? I'm not afraid to die. You'll never die. I won't let you go. Be conquered by my faith. You weren't born to die. You are being and breath. What you are can never be destroyed. Doctor, why don't you take a break? When I know the patient's going to live, that's when, Ben. Checklist. - OK. Systolic intervals, check? - Yeah. (Koenig) 'The heat waves are blasting Alpha.' (Fraser) 'I hope there's something left for us to land on.' Here we go. (Rhythmic beeping) (Ben) Come on, tiranium. Hang on in there. (Helena) That wall's got to hold. Well... the job's half done. (Bleep) Yes, Helena. Tony, it's working. The new heart is working! You've gotta find her and bring her back. (Rumbling explosion) - 'Tony?' - Must be shock waves from the storm. Tony, we can't lose Michelle now, we just can't lose her now! We'll get her. Come on. Heavy damage to all surface installations, Commander. Some casualties, but we are functioning. - Can you clear a landing area? - Top priority, Commander. (Explosion) - More surface explosions? - Yeah. Osgood prophecy. Just as well we're following a prophet. Unless HE explodes. (Explosion) (Explosion) (Explosion) Listen! (Footsteps) Pat, it's me, Tony. Listen. The new heart - it's working! Wait, Pat! (Explosion) It's all right, darling. Come on. It's no good. We'll never find them in the dark. He doesn't need to see, not the way he knows the catacombs. - Maya? - 'Yes, Tony?' We're in the catacombs, level three. Get here on the double. Not so many injured as I thought. Suppose we do catch up with him. Will it matter? Another thing I like. You're always upbeat(!) - (Maya) Tony! - Maya! - Maya? - Over here, Tony. Osgood's taken Michelle deep into the catacombs. Somebody's gotta go in after them, somebody who can see in the dark. Let's hear you, so we can follow. (Maya growls) Come on. (Growling) (Growling) (Growling grows louder) (Patrick) Michelle. (Explosion) (Man screaming) Tony! I'm OK. I've got Michelle. - Where's Osgood? - He's buried under a rock fall. Give me a hand. Get her to Medical, fast. - What about Osgood? - I'm not gonna leave him here. (Artificial heart beeps) Are we ready? Power on the hypothermic lance. Incision. (Hypothermic lance bleeps) Nurse. Heart rate irregular. - Heart stopped. - Retractors. - Pressure going down. - Clamp off. Pressure gone. Suction. Electric cautery. Arterial clamp. Venous clamp. (Ben) The heart's started again. (Ben) The heartbeat's excellent, but the pulse rate's poor. Her vital signs are weak. She's dying. With this heart, she should live forever, but we just can't transplant faith. Patrick said she would survive, but without him... - He's alive. - Put him right next to his wife. It's over. (Helena) I think Michelle's going to be all right. I wonder if Patrick will regain his mental stability? Yeah, maybe, given enough time... and faith. I see you can't tear yourself away from admiring my artistry. No, I was thinking about Patrick and Michelle. About Patrick. You know, one thing bothers me. He predicted that storm. How? Don't say he communicated with that cloud! His mind WAS under tremendous strain. We know so little about the universe. Who's to say there wasn't an intelligence in that heat storm able to communicate with Patrick in the state he was in? Not me. Oh, would you look at that colour? Pure amber. And the consistency - not a bubble in sight. Our computer analysis of your last concoction... Yeah, yeah. Unfit for human consumption. What does a computer know about beer, anyway? No lust for adventure, no imagination, no taste, nothing. Mmm. Ah, Verdeschi, you're a genius. (Bleep) Yes, Sahn? 'Tony, Eagle 1 has just touched down.' Welcome back, John. 'It's good to be back, Helena. I guess luck was with us. - 'What's with Alpha?' - Everything's OK. - We were about to raise a glass. - 'Not of your manufacture, I hope.' Only one of us is that adventurous. Oh, that is fantastic. Who said that was unfit for human consumption? Who said you were human(?) I'm going to find Maya. If I'm to be insulted, it'll be done by an expert. John, thanks for the tiranium. - 'Tiranium?' - It saved Michelle's life. 'Didn't I...? - 'Oh, yeah.' - Welcome back, John.
