 Was it worth it? It doesn't feel that way right now. Why did she do it? She was trying to protect you. We have to go on. But how? How can we just go on? We have to, otherwise it will all have been in vain. Rasmus must get well for everything to go back to normal. That was Lea's dream, too. Did he survive? - Sarah, you shouldn't be here. - I need to know if he survived.

 He did. We think we did it. You certainly did something. But what was it you did? - What happened? - It hurts like crazy! - Your knee? Can you walk? - No. Just go on without me. No way. - Come here. Can you bend it? - Yes. Sit still. I hope Simone hasn't tried that cure on Rasmus yet. - I almost believed you for a second. - What do you mean? - That you didn't care about her. - This isn't about Simone. Sure it is. And it's OK. You're madly in love with her. Stop pretending otherwise.

 - Since when did you become a therapist? - It's written across your face. So, you had a fight. If anyone deserves each other in this shithole, it's you two. OK! So let's find the others and get out of this shithole together. OK. Oh, fuck! - Can you walk? - Yes. Freeze! Keep your hands visible! We ran blood tests. The cure seems to be working. It's wiping out the virus. I can't remember what happened. Rasmus, Lea... What happened to Lea? Lea tried to protect you. It wasn't your fault, Rasmus. - I killed her. - Rasmus, it wasn't your fault. - I... - Rasmus... You weren't yourself. You weren't yourself. I thought you were dead. Don't come any closer. I killed Lea. I'm glad you're alive. What the hell is going on? They're building an army. Kneel. You can't stop this. You have to let us go. We must get back to the others. It's too late. There's nothing left to do. Listen to me. Simone is trying to cure Rasmus. - We have to stop her. - She's trying to cure him? Yes, but she can't, right? She's just making matters worse, and you know that. If you can't cure him either, then why? What do you want from him if you can't stop it? You're right, it will only get worse. The virus. That's how it works. It can't be stopped, but Rasmus is living proof that we can adapt to it, make it part of us. That's what we'll do. We won't cure him, we'll cure us. OK, you're out of your mind. - You think so? - Yes. Well, what's the alternative?! Just sit back, allow the virus to lay waste and kill us all? Rasmus can't die. Rasmus is the future. Kill them. They're going to be in our way. I'll take care of their friends. I know you're there. I'm sorry, Jean. I don't know what happened. You got angry... and she just tried to help you. And then you killed her. They say I'm cured now. Good for you. Is it bad? You could fry an egg on your forehead. Well, I am hungry. Ha-ha. I stopped by Jakob's grave today. Oh? How was he doing? Sarah, I know you think he didn't matter to me. But he did, and I wish none of this had happened. Now it's just the two of us. Or two and a half, if you will. I'll take care of you. Can't you just do it for him? Is it so hard for you to see I actually care for you? Hey... Come here. OK. What do you want? If you want to save the others, then come with me. Go. She's lost it. Come on, Mom! No! Hold on! Come on! Come. We can't make it back. We can't! - How did they find us? - We can't get out of the zone. - Yes! Come on. - No. - We can do it. Come on. - No! There is hope, as long as one of us survives. What are you saying? You must convince them that you're on their side. - You have to gain their trust. - Get up! Kira. - I love you. - No! Get down! Get down! - Hi. - Hi. - Rasmus's test results will be in soon. - Yeah. I can't face him. I just can't forget what he did. His anger. You saw it. What I saw was a big sister who tried her utmost to save her brother. You showed tremendous strength and you put your life on the line. We did it. - What? - We did it! Rasmus has been cured! - Seriously? - He's cured, damn it! We did it! He's cured! - We have to find him. - Yes. Go find him. I think we got here first. It's not him. Maybe he knows how to get in. When it gets dark, everyone will see you. We know you have him! We want the guy with the virus! The boy! We want the boy. OK. I'll take you to him. How do you feel? I've got a fever. I feel awful. Come. - What? - Come here. Stand there. Hold on. What? I don't know if... Rasmus, watch out! Behind you! Be quiet! Sarah! Rasmus? This is so beautiful. I think she can feel you. You haven't seen Rasmus, have you? - Yes. - He's with Sarah? They took him. Who? What do you mean? It's all your fault. And you know it. Jean, where is he? They took him. Who took him?! I hope he dies. - Are you OK, Sarah? - Shut up! Can't you do something, Rasmus?! Look straight ahead. Get a move on! Why don't you kill us? Huh? Where are you taking us? Get down! What the hell? What's going on? She's also one of us? Do you have a back-up plan? - Do you? - Be quiet! Be quiet! We want the same thing. I don't want your friends to die. We must get to the base before the others, or Apollon will kill everyone. You can't trust her, Martin. I'm the only reason the two of you are still alive. I want to take Apollon down, but I need Rasmus. You don't know how much I have sacrificed. - OK. - OK? We'll do as she says. If only I knew what the hell she's saying. Who are you? What were you after? Whatever it was, you failed. You fought back like you were willing to die for the cause. And you all did. Everyone except you. You killed one of your own. Why? - Because I wanted out. - Out? I want to get out of here and I'm prepared to do anything. - I can help you. - What do you want me to do? Nothing you haven't already done. I can do that. That's good. That will be all. Fie... They took him. - What are you talking about? Who? - They took Rasmus. - What? - Come. Open the door. - Do you know what he can do? - Shut up! Open the door. - Why do you think Apollon's after him? - Open the door. What do you think they want? He can kill us all. - Open the door! - Tell her. What's wrong with him? He's having a seizure! I told you so! You have to run! - Run! - Get out. Run! You have to get out! Are you OK? - What happened? - They took off. - Who? - They came for Rasmus. Are you OK? Yes. Are you OK? You're cured. What? It worked. You're cured. You're cured! We did it. We did it. We have to find out if there are more of them. What the hell's going on? They're going to capture Rasmus and kill the others. - They don't know what's in store. - If they get in, the boy will kill them. - I've seen what he's capable of. - Not sure if I feel sorry for them. I can't control how you feel, but let's avoid loss of innocent lives. - OK, but how do we get in first? - I know. There's a second entrance. Why the hell did Jean let them in? It's my fault. How can it be your fault? I was hell-bent on saving Rasmus and you guys paid the price. No, that's not on you. It's happened. We aren't safe here anymore. Others may be coming. Let's go tonight. Fie, I'm sorry. They're here! Come! - You know where it is? - Where what is? - Where the secret entrance is? - What entrance? How do you know? Who are you? The guy who broke in, what did he want? Why doesn't Apollon know about the entrance, but you do? Because you're not one of them. I saw you in the video! - I saw her in the video! - What do you mean? How did you get that spaced-out gun to fire away like that? Can it extract the capsules? How do you plan to take down Apollon? No more questions! OK. We're here. So, maybe ease up on the questions. - Give me a hand? - Sure. - What? - Wait here. OK? - Why? - In case anyone comes. And then what? Stare them down till they crap themselves? You might just as well turn this gun against me, but then you'd be making a huge mistake. - What did she say? - She told you not to shoot her. Sure, got it. Yes, cool. - See you later. - Yeah. Is this yours? What? Well, you're cured now. Yeah. Or so they say. OK. - Hi. - Hi. - We need to go. - OK. Where are we going? Apollon is closing in, with drones. Put these on. - What is it? - So the drones won't see us. - Where's Jean? - We can't find him. We have to go now. Hold it. Jean? Who's she? Where the hell are you? I see you. He's in the control room. Jean, what's going on? Get Rasmus down here. - What? - And your lady friend stays put. - Jean... - I'll press the button. - What button? - Do as he says or he'll sound the alarm. Jean, what do you want with Rasmus? He killed Lea. And you walked out on us. It's your fault. So, go get him. OK, find him. Go get Rasmus! Go! Does it work? They are coming! They're already here. Go back! Go, go, go! Simone! Martin... What happened here? Never go away again. I won't. I'm right here. OK? - But we have to go. - There are intruders at the gate. - We'll exit through the basement. - Where's Jean? He's down there. But he's not alone. Come on. Hey. He doesn't deserve to live. It doesn't matter, he just can't die. Do you understand? You can't stop me. When he comes down here, I'm going to kill him. Don't be stupid. You don't know what's at stake. - I need him... - I don't care about you. OK... I need him, it's my last chance. Please. OK, listen. You have to work with me... Wait! You have to go back. - Why is she here? - She came for Rasmus. Listen, your friend in there wants your brother dead. - He's in there? - Yes. Jean! Jean, we're leaving. We have to get out. Jean, open the door! Jean, I know it's hard. I know you're hurting. So am I. But come out here and let's talk about it. - Come, Jean... - Rasmus, no matter what, you must get out. Don't worry about the rest of us. - What do you mean? - We're fucked right now. - But you have to survive. - Why do you say that? Open the door, OK? Just open the door. I'll help you, Jean. Just open the door. That's all you need to do. You have to survive. OK? He's cured. He can't be. The virus is gone, he carries the cure. If he survives, he can save the world. That's impossible, it can't be right. Jean! Jean, look at me. Look at me. Jean, look at me. Jean... Look at me! Jean, look at me! No! No, no, no! Go, go, go! Lea? Don't do it, Jean. No! Don't do it. What have I done? Hurry! Come! Rasmus! In there! Get in! Rasmus? Rasmus! Fuck, fuck! Fie! Fie! Help me! Fie! Come on! Easy. Look at me. There you go. - We have to go now. - They're coming! - Rasmus, let's go! - I can't stop the bleeding! Let go. Give me... - Let go! - Come on! Come on, come on! Breathe. Just breathe. - You're going to make it. - No, I won't. Yes, you're going to make it. I don't think I will. Rasmus... Kiss me. You take forever. Just like Romeo and Juliet. Sarah... Sarah. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! No! Sarah! Rasmus! No, no, no. We have to go. We have to go now. - Come on! - Simone! Get away! Rasmus! Rasmus! Rasmus! What do you want?! What?! Rasmus... What have you done? What have I done? It wasn't me. It was they who... It was you! Why won't you leave me alone? - We have to get back. - I don't have to do anything. They killed Sarah. She's gone! Stop. Stop! Stop! Stop. Do you really want to do that? - Dad said... - Dad is dead, Simone. Dad's dead because he tried to change me, just like they did! They simply wouldn't accept who I was. This isn't who you are. You're not yourself, sweetie. You don't know who I am! You don't know what it's like! You don't know how I feel, do you?! I tried to protect you. I tried to protect you. - No. - Stop. - You just want to change me. - Stop. Stop. Rasmus! Rasmus! Rasmus... Rasmus, look at me! Look at me! Don't do it. Don't do it. No. No, Martin. We'll work it out. - No. - Together. We'll work it out. - We're not working anything out! - We will... You're always calling the shots! Not anymore! Don't get in my way! You shot me. It's OK.
