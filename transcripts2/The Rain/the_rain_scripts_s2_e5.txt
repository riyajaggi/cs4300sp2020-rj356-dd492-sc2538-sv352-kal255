 Come on. Come on. Don't do it. It's a fucking miracle. Remember what he's been through. He's still weak. Frederik, try to understand what this means. For the entire world. He's going to save all of us. Rasmus... I know you're awake and that you heard us. Dad says I'm weak. No, you're not. Your dad's afraid of his own creation. But that's because he doesn't know what you are. A miracle.

 You can save all of mankind. With each passing day, you will grow more and more powerful, and one day, you will begin to realize your true potential. - Are we ready? - Soon. Fie is checking the results to make sure they're correct. Okay. Do you know how it will work? Not one hundred percent. I want to do it. I just want to be normal. I know what I'm doing. What if it goes wrong? What if something happens? - I'm supposed to protect you. - What if I'm old enough to protect myself? - You can't even tie your own shoelaces. - No, but I don't have to. Shut up. Maybe if you stopped taking it upon yourself all the time, I could start making my own decisions. - Is this because of her? - Who? Who? Do you think I'm stupid? Sarah. No. Shut up. We don't need a cure. It's going to kill us. - You're not real. - We could kill her. We have powers she can't comprehend. Why let her win? Hey. Hi. - May I? - Yes, of course. Where's Martin? He's gone. Patrick is gone too. They're not coming back. It's not your fault. Those who aren't here anymore... made the decision to leave. They're letting us down. Keep that in mind. She screwed you over, Martin. You had no choice. Now you feel bad, and that's pathetic. That's women for you. They crawl into your head and piss all over your brain cells... Patrick, let's not talk about it. - Sure, sure. - And then explain to me, how dow we extract the capsules, once we get to Apollon? - We... - You don't know? - But... - You know that someone else was able to? No. So, we know where we're going, but not what to do once we're there? - Kind of. - Okay, great. Great plan, Patrick. I'm just trying to run with what we've got. - Do you have a better suggestion? - Nope, nothing. Then let's get the capsules out and get the hell out. That's exactly right. - That's exactly what we should do! - That's exactly it! Well? You were right. There are two controller genes. - What does that mean? - It means we might have a cure. But what? He needs to know how dangerous it is, and that there is a risk. He knows. And what about you? Do you realize that you risk losing him and that this treatment is irreversible? Fie... I have to kill him if the cure doesn't work. What? That's not going to happen. This is our chance. - Yes, our last chance. - So let's make the most of it. - Okay? - Okay. Hi. - What are you doing here? - I just wanted to check on you. Sarah, you do know that all of this... I'm doing this so that we can be together. If I survive that long. Sorry. It's okay. I've started having these visions. - I've started seeing myself as a child. - Okay. What does the child version of you say? That I shouldn't be cured. I agree with that. I don't understand. - I'm doing this so that we... - So that we can be together? Rasmus, look around you. This shithole of a place... - I'm never getting out of here. - Yes, you will. If you stay with me, we'll be stuck in a sterile shoebox until I die of a simple infection. - Why do you say that? - Because it's the truth! There won't be any more good days. Not like this! I'm sorry. Sarah... you can't touch me! Funny, isn't it? The thing you want to rid yourself of, I wish I had it! They will cure me as soon as possible. Maybe you don't believe in us, but I still do! Here you go. We can be powerful. She wants to destroy us. Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. What's up? You're a girl, right? Yes, the last time I checked. - So can I ask you something? - How can I, as a girl, help you? What's up? Is it... Is it Lea? You like her and she likes you. Yes. So what's the problem? I'm afraid. - Of what? - Of losing her. It's silly... Hey... Nothing is going to happen to Lea, but it's okay to tell her you are afraid. It's like you and Martin. You can't figure it out either. - I think it's different with us. - Is it? Something always gets in the way. The virus. The end of the world. I just believed... I just believed we were meant to be. That we were meant to be together. - That's what he promised me. - Yes. If he was still here, what would you tell him? I'd tell him he's an idiot. Okay. I think I'll tell Lea something else. Yes, I think that's a good idea. Thanks, Simone. Petra! Yes? Food! It's full of black virus. Throw it away, damn it. Throw it away! On your feet, now! Get up, get up! You're coming with us. Come on. Come on. - Let's go. - Yes. Come on. I'm from Apollon. I know some of you fear that name, but today, we have to put aside our differences. I'm here because I need your help. You've all seen it... the virus... that came with the rain. It killed our loved ones. It seemed unstoppable, but not far from here, there is a boy who holds the key to stopping the virus. But he is being kept from us by evil forces, which is why I'm standing here. I need your help to find the boy. The first of you to find this boy... the first of you to bring him before us, will be allowed to leave the zone. We'll find him first, okay? We'll be the first. What's the first thing you'll do after you get out of the zone? I'm going to find a clean toilet. Then I'll take a huge dump and wipe my ass with clean toilet paper and wash my hands. - With soap. - That's what I'm talking about. - It's been on my mind for six years. - I can tell. What about you? What are you going to do? I want a house. A wife... Someone who wants me. A job. I want to get my act together for once in my life. What? Where did Patrick go? - I'm not allowed to be sensitive? - Sure. Buttercup. Shut up. Patrick. What the hell is that? Should we go back and warn the others? If they think they can stop it? No, we're moving on. You have to trust me. She wants to destroy us. Trust me. Lea? I need to talk... to you. I want to show you something first. What is it? Welcome. It's us. And all the things we've done. All the good things. That's when I helped you cook. - You sucked at that. - Yeah, I burned the food. - We hadn't eaten for three days. - No. - But you didn't get angry. - No. You didn't do it on purpose. No. What's that? That's when I helped you find new glasses. You still have them. Yeah, well, it's not like there are tons of cool glasses lying around. No. I know that you're scared. It's okay, I'm scared too. But it helps to think of the fond memories we've shared, when you're afraid. Okay? Okay. Come here. - When can I have the cure? - What are you doing? - When can I have the cure? - Tomorrow. - It can't wait. I'm in a bad way. - I understand... No, I don't think you do! I'm going fucking insane! Don't listen to her. She's lying. - Rasmus... - Why can't we do it now? It's not ready. Yes, but I want it now. I want it now. Rasmus, stop! Stop that! Go to your room. I'll let you know when it's ready. There's nothing wrong with us. She doesn't want us to be powerful. You're only taking the cure because she's telling you to. She wants us to be weak, like Dad said. Shut up! Shut up! Make it stop! No! Rasmus! Rasmus! But we walked away from it. Should we find another way, or... This is the right way. There. I don't like it. This place is abandoned. The magnet machine should be in the basement. Ready? Well? Is it still working? - Martin, we just have to... - Hush. Come on. What the hell? Did they mention a lab in the video? No, just that the magnet should be in the basement. I told him it wasn't ready. He didn't take that much. The virus is still inside him. Why did he do it? Because I had no other choice. How do you feel? Why did you do it? Because I... Because I hallucinated and I heard voices, and... They said... What? What did they say? She wants us to be weak, like Dad said. You need me. What did they say? I don't think we can extract it. I think it's part of me. - What makes you say that? - Because... Because that's how it feels. Right? The virus needs a host to survive, so that's why it makes you feel that way. But it's not real. It's just a feeling. - But it feels real. - Yes. Feelings do. What the fuck were they doing in there? We shouldn't be here. - What if they never found that machine? - They must have. It has to be here. I doubt it. I think we should leave. - Hey. - Hi. We're ready in an hour. Rasmus will be okay. Yes. Hey... Neither you nor the cure is going to kill him. But, Fie... I don't know if he still wants to. He's just scared. Yeah. I sure as hell am, too. A miracle. A masterpiece. You are the future, Rasmus. Sarah. What happened? Fie says you tried to give yourself the cure. Yes. But it didn't work? No, I... I wanted to take a full dose, but I couldn't. When I did it, I felt like I was falling apart on the inside. As if everything... fell to pieces. I can't explain it, but it felt wrong. Maybe because it is wrong. Rasmus, you and I are alike. I've always been ill. I don't remember what it's like not to be. Just like you feel about the virus. If it feels so wrong, maybe you shouldn't do it. Maybe you know more about what's right than your sister does. Sarah... The virus is part of you. Help! Help! Martin, the tattoo. What the hell? - You shouldn't have come. - Hey! Who are you? Who are you? Hey, hey, hey! Unless I do this, the virus will eject into the room, within... one minute and 53 seconds. What the fuck are you doing? Hey! The door! - Hey, man! - How do you open this door? Hey! How do you open the door? Huh? Increased dose, yes. 0.05 mg. He's out of his fucking mind! That ought to do it. - One minute and 20 seconds. - Fuck! You let us out of here now! Stand back. Stand back! Fuck! Open that door! I can't. I have to stop it! I have to keep him alive! Okay, fine. Just let us out first. Let us out first. - Open the door. - You might have been exposed to the virus. I have to run tests on you. I can't just let you go. Look at me. Look at me. Hey. Do you even know if that works? Huh? Have you tried it before? Twenty-four seconds. Then we'll find out. Ten, nine... eight, seven... six, five... four, three... Open the fucking door! - Patrick, his hand! - Yes! Come here! Come here! Get out! Close the door! It worked? No. Hello! What the fuck is this place? Huh? This is where we were supposed to solve it. This is where we were supposed to beat it, but the virus just keeps fighting back. So you tried to kill the virus? We can't control it. With each experiment, the virus became more and more aggressive. It has killed every test subject. It will destroy us. It's pointless, don't you see? Please kill me. I can't take this any longer. Just kill me! Go! Hi. Hi. Is it time? Yes. Soon. And Rasmus is okay with it? He's on board? Yes. Okay. Hey. Come here. You're strong, Simone. When you push all your doubts aside, you're as strong as an ox. This is only happening because you believe in it. - I don't know if I do. - Yes, you do. As long as you're here, everything will be fine. You have sacrificed so much, and now you will save all of us. That's a lot of weight on my shoulders. Yes, but I know that you can handle it. - Here. - Thanks. Are you okay? Yeah. - I don't want to. - What? The cure, I... It doesn't feel right. I don't want to do it. I understand, but... Fie says it's just a feeling, but she doesn't know how it feels. - I don't want to do it. - Apollon could be here any time. Yeah, but I'm not afraid of Apollon. I'm afraid of what I'll do if... I can't control it. We're not doing it. Why aren't you saying anything? Hey. It's for your own good. Fuck, man! We have to get back. We have to get back before they try to cure him. If they do... they're all going to die. Hey... Hey... Hey, hey. Rasmus... Rasmus, stay calm. Lie still. - Rasmus, we're giving you the cure now. - No, I don't want it. It will be over soon. Sweetie... - Simone? - Just calm down. - Are they curing him? - Yes. - Rasmus, it will all be over soon. - Simone... Simone, I don't want it! - I want you to let me go now! - Try to relax. Let me go now! Fie. I don't want it. Simone, I don't want it. Release me! - Lie still. - No, I don't want it! Fie, stop! Stop! Don't! Stop! Stop! Get Sarah! Don't! Simone! Simone, get out! Simone! Simone... - Simone... - Calm down. - I can't control it. - Hey! Calm down. I can't control it! Simone! Rasmus... Simone! Simone, get out! No. Yes. Lea, no! You have to go, Lea, get out! No! Lea, no... No! No, Lea! No, Lea! Lea, no! No, Lea!
