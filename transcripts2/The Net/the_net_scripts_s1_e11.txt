 Mr Boek? The spelling usually throws people. Sir, Mr Mitchelson wouldn't like it if I mispronounced a customer's name. Well, I appreciate that, Robert. ID, gentlemen? - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. Please sign in, sir. Another hot day in the Big Apple, eh? Feels like I'm back home in South Africa. - So, Sand, is it? - Yes, sir. - Where am I going, Sand? - Down the hall, last door on your left.

 - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. Mr Mitchelson, Adrian Boek. - Pleasure. - Pleasure. These are for my not-so-important clients, not so discerning as you. Well, it's my good luck simply to be here, sir. The buyer is always right, so long as he has the cash. You are so right, it hurts. I have exceptional whites. Pinks, of course. Flawless... brilliantly cut. Nothing less than 75 points. You can check for inclusions... I can't find the Vesper! - Adrian. - It's not here! We should go now. Let's go.

 I don't believe this. Hope everything went well, Mr Boek. My name is Angela Bennett. I discovered a group of computer terrorists. They erased my life. They made me into a criminal. I am not going to stop until I get my life back. But if they did this to me, they could do this to you. The Vesper is a $60 million diamond. - Well, whose is it? - Some dead guy's. - You're about to meet his son. - Well, with that much money involved... everybody's going to try and claim the diamond. The Vesper Diamond's got a history, not pretty. A lot of blood spilled as it's changed hands. So you want us to change the history of greed? - We can try. - What is this? That would mean converting the greedy. I mean, how much chance is there of that? Okay. Well, do you know who stole it? Do you know where it is? Do you think we should reconsider this? I don't know for sure... but I'm pretty sure that the Praetorians are tangled in this. It's got their stink. If Trelawney stole the Vesper Diamond, it's gone. Downsized from one to 50, sold at $2 million a pop... and he doubled his repulsiveness. I'm not so sure the diamond was stolen. - Why, because they didn't grab everything? - Exactly. Look, I was in my room looking for this disc, you know... tossing things around, I'm pissed off... and my nana walks in, flips, and it hits me. The killer didn't get what he was looking for. Is that a kick or what? Which is why you gotta go meet him. Who's "him"? The guy walking toward the Ferrari. Mr Mitchelson's only surviving kid, Aaron. I pulled down some encrypted messages... between some creepy South Africans and, I think, Trelawney. His stamp. South Africa, that would be diamond mine after diamond mine. Well, these guys I picked up are old-timers... like, from back in the day when the whites in South Africa had everything. Well, that wasn't so long ago, Junior. These guys want to go back to the good old days. Just the kind of idea Praetorians would suck up to. Now, the guy that I've been monitoring flew into Kennedy three days ago. So you think that he's involved in the Mitchelson killing? What about his son, Aaron? Oh, Aaron and his father have had a long-running, public feud. He's been selling off the business, living it up, fast cars, faster girls-- Your dream. Not at the price of my father. Well, I don't think that feuds and living it up means that he's particularly involved. The killers knew where their surveillance tapes were. They got in clean. They had someone inside. Okay. So I go and I meet this guy Aaron. He's just supposed to tell me that he did it? Sometimes, you just don't listen. You know, Jacob, it's a good thing you're a genius... because I don't think that you would have that many friends. I don't have any friends. Except you. Okay. So I go and I make friends with this guy Aaron. We try to find the diamond. You shoot billiards, Mr Mitchelson? It's all angles and rebounds, isn't it? - You shoot billiards, Mr Shreck? - People. What have you done with the diamond? You didn't get it? Let me make one thing very clear for you, all right? That diamond is mine. It belongs to my people. Now, where did you hide the Vesper? If you don't have it, I don't know where it is. I'm telling you the truth. I don't know. Your father moved it. Where? I'd ask him, but he was killed. You weren't supposed to hurt him. He loved that diamond more than he loved you... and you're still defending him. You're pathetic, you know that? I'm going to give you a day or two to come up with it. Think it over. Nine ball? Six ball? Stretch the quarter. You want to play against me? What? You think you can beat me because I'm not a guy? No, I didn't say that. Well, your tone was, "You're a girl." Is it beyond your conception that I could beat you? Well, I only play for money. When it's for money, I don't call it "play." Grudge match rules. All right. You scratch, I put the cue ball anywhere I want. I don't scratch. You want to break? Go ahead. What's the bet? How about dinner? - I pick the place. - Why not? Nice shot. I'm building up an appetite. I'm sorry I'm late, but the airport was a zoo. - Hi. Aaron? - That's right. I'm Sean McDaniels, your father's banker. - We talked on the phone. - Hi. Well, shall we get down to business, okay? I have to be here, Aaron, because of certain stipulations... that your father put into the will just last month. I'm sorry. I should have offered my condolences first thing. - I've just been hurrying about so much-- - No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. Forget it. What stipulations? I thought that everything just went to me and the will was pretty much a formality. The business? Yeah, it's yours. Oh. But this concerns the Vesper Diamond. I thought you knew that. The Vesper? You know where it is? My bank does, yes. You see, your father wanted to keep it in the family... but he felt that it was best to put it somewhere 100% safe... so where else but a bank? - A museum is what we came up with. - A museum? Well, this way you don't pay any taxes. You can tell everyone you own the Vesper Diamond. So I still own it? Technically, but I think to insure the gem not fall into the wrong hands... the father stipulated that the museum was to hold the diamond indefinitely... on your behalf. - For me? He did it for me? - Yes. You know, Aaron, there's nothing in this world like a father's love. - Have you got my diamond? - No, but I know who does. Is this a riddle? Just tell me. My father left it to a museum. No one gets it now. It's a final revenge on all of us. So how do you propose we acquire it, then? I can't get it. Nobody can. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There is one thing. One thing. - Can you hear them? - You know what? Move it to the left. ...and I want my Vesper Diamond back. More to the left. My lawyer's working on this... because, technically, it is still mine. Well, yours. That's really what I meant. So what's the dilly-o? They know where the diamond is. So I'm gonna get it for you somehow, just like I promised first time around. Okay? You guys could take the Vesper back to South Africa. Okay? I don't want it. You, my stupid young friend, are a dead man. No, no, listen. I don't want to die. I really don't. Okay? So I'm going to get it for you. I promise. I'm going to get it for you. Okay? Just don't kill me. Okay? I swear. Two days. What's the dilly? What's going on? Sometimes I just... I feel like I've screwed my entire life up, you know? Like I'm just reacting to things. I don't have any control over my own destiny. It's funny, because I used to think I had everything figured out, you know? - I'm boring you, huh? - No, no, not at all, no. Well... like here, I owe you a dinner, and then cancel at the last minute... and you're nice enough to come and meet me here... and now I'm just telling you my life history. I don't mind. I don't. Really, you haven't told me that much, actually. It's just that you didn't get along with your father. You didn't say why or anything. Well, it's a long story. Why don't you just tell me about you? Oh, no. That's an even longer story. No, I don't believe that. You must have had brothers teach you how to shoot pool like that, huh? No, just me and the pockets. I was, I guess, I don't know, a shy kid. Can't judge a book by its cover, can you? That's what they say, anyway. - Yeah. Whoever "they" is. - Oh, I know. Every time I say "they this" or "they that"... all of a sudden I feel like the paranoids are getting to me. It's just crazy, right? - Yeah. - Right this way, sir. I'm not crazy, but, I mean... Not that I'm a conspiracy freak or anything... thing, you know? I mean, sometimes conspiracy people, they have a point... but they can just take it too far, you know? Linguini. And tell them not to smother it. And, please, al dente. Yes, sir, al dente. They just don't seem to know when enough is enough. You wouldn't happen to serve me a beer, would you? - I don't think so, sir. Anything else? - Iced tea, then. Very well. All I know is, it feels like the whole world is conspiring against me. Yeah, you know... sometimes you can get in over your head. That's all. You can talk about it. I'm a really good listener. I'm so sorry to interrupt you, but there's a telephone call for you... at the reservation desk. For me? No one even knows I'm here. I can tell the caller you're not, if you'd like, but he didn't leave his name. I better take it. Excuse me. - You are out of your mind. - Who isn't? Listen, I ran a photo trace on the South African. He's Otto Verhome, alias Peter Boekhome, sometimes Adrian Boek. So? He is the guy who signed in at the diamond exchange... and probably killed Aaron's father. We know that. Angela, I did a background on this guy. He's the hatchet man for the most radical Afrikaner movement there is. Aaron is in thick. Be careful. - If Boek catches on, he takes no prisoners. - You know, I was getting somewhere. You risked getting us caught with this little stunt. I called Aaron on the phone. And we've got, I figure, 10 seconds before he gets back. You really are strange. But you like me, right? You're okay. Well, I think you're great, and you look terrific. So, after lunch you ditch him, huh? - Excuse me. - Oh, pardon me. - We'll trail him, okay? - Hi. Hi! Unbelievable. Totally weird. What? I go to the phone, right? And there's nobody there. No! It must have been the paranoids. I'm just getting a little nervous, Mr Trelawney. You say you have your ducks lined up... and then you tell me you don't even have the fake diamond yet. The spider spins its web in its own time, sir. I understand. You're creating perception. That's the point, isn't it? Now, look at diamonds. As common as grass... but one family monopolises all the world's diamond mines... so they control supply and perception. Everyone thinks diamonds must be rare. People are sheep. And like to be seduced. That's half the fun. Getting them to believe our ideas are their genius notions. Just like our Mr Boek. I've cranked his greed. Now I put this into his hand. A schematic of our alarm system guarding the Vesper. You have a mean streak in you, Mr Trelawney. I think it's because of the way you grew up. You don't like to talk about that, do you? The past... is dead with me, sir. It's what brought you to me. It's what keeps you here. You can't escape your past, Mr Trelawney. Call me when you have the Vesper. You sure they were all coming here? Yeah, unless Aaron lied to me. Wait. I'm getting something. How are you this evening, Mr White? Not in the mood for conversation, Mr Red. Through my contacts, I have been able to make your job a lot easier. Now, I hear you are the best thief in the business. So with this, you should be able to guarantee me my diamond. What is it? It is the key to the museum's security system. You getting this? Every word of it. Who's he? He knows the specifics of the stone. His father was a jeweller. We'll do it this Sunday night. The museum's closed Mondays, and I want the breathing room. All right. Briefcase. This should cover your expenses. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. - What? They're gonna steal the Vesper Diamond. Then we gotta steal it first. Yeah. I trust that will be sufficient. Very nice. Very, very nice, Mr White. It's going to be a pleasure doing business with you. No security? Not a very prudent idea, considering my father was just murdered... in this very room only three days ago. Well, your choice, of course. I mention it only because my news... details events with the Vesper Diamond. Not the kind of thing one wants to share with one's employees. I'll ring when I want you. Well... your father would cry to see you at his working table, sitting in his chair. This wasn't his chair. What about the Vesper? But then, your father would cry to find out that you were the one responsible... for his ugly death. That you're playing foosball with South African loonies like Mr Boek. Dropped your stone, son. How do you know Boek? I read. Sorry. Couldn't resist. Who are you? I'm your inner child, Aaron. The part of you that has ugly dreams. That wakes to wet sheets and a dry throat. I'm the part of you, Aaron, that killed your dear father. I didn't mean to. Neither did I. Mr Boek reports to me. I own him. And now I own you. I already promised that I would get the diamond to Boek. I can't do any more. Not "any more," Aaron. I want you to do less. I've left footprints in the ether. I know my trail has been followed and by whom. A beautiful woman, Aaron... who can't resist someone in need. She thinks that this is some type of strength. You already know her. What is it about you? Your feathers never get ruffled. Yeah, I learn quickly. That's why I'm so sassy and confident. Unless you let me beat you. No, I mean, about life. You just kind of seem glide right through it. I've done my fair share of flying into the wind. Yeah? What if it's a hurricane? Then you have friends. You find the calm spot amidst the madness and you talk about it. I guess I'm seeing for the first time that money isn't everything, you know? - It's never too late to learn that. - Well, it may be for me. What are you doing Sunday night? Sunday night? How'd you like to break into a museum with me and steal the Vesper Diamond? Okay, and then Monday we'll loot Fort Knox. And they say that New Yorkers cram too much in a weekend. This is the real thing, Angela. Okay. Tell me. What? My father was Nathan Mitchelson of Mitchelson Jewellers. He always said that you should be like a diamond... hard, cutting. I just got so tired of arm-wrestling him for my future, you know? Yeah. He wanted you in the family business? He demanded that I be in the business. I wanted anything but. It's tough to break away. I can't even really say that I miss him. I feel terrible about how he died. I'm sorry. It was the diamond that killed him, Angela. The Vesper. - And it's gonna kill me, too. - What are you saying? I got involved with some bad guys, some fast money people. They knew about the Vesper. Said they'd pay me in cash... lots of it. So you told them where the Vesper Diamond was? I did. But your dad had already moved it to the museum. I know. I feel like I killed him, Angela. That I killed my own father. So Boek... he's this guy I got involved with, this crazy South African. He says I gotta help him steal the diamond or he's gonna kill me. So... how can I help you? I thought, you know, devious me... what if there was a second diamond, a fake Vesper? That way... someone could break in... steal the original... and replace it with the fake one. That's what Boek could steal. You see? - A switch. - Exactly. I could repay my debt to my father... the dishonour I brought on his name. We could give the diamond back to the South African people. Well, do you have a fake Vesper? My father would probably never admit to it... but there is a sizeable cubic zirconium... that he kept in the showroom. Large enough to make a fake Vesper? Yeah, but we'd have to make the switch before Boek got there. The only problem is, it takes at least a month to cut it by hand. Unless you use a computer. It's not every day that a guy confesses to a total stranger that he killed his father. Well, I think he's been under huge stress. That means he just snapped. Tears, even. You know, he didn't have to tell me about Boek or Trelawney... even though he didn't mention his name. Two words: baby browns. You know, I'm trying to be serious here. One look in your eyes, babushka, and it's "Goodbye, yellow brick road." Do you even know what a babushka is? A woman's head scarf worn loosely tied under her chin. All right. When are you going to take a hose to this place? - Clean is a relative concept. - Yeah, everything is relative. This place is just disgusting. How am I supposed to think? I don't know what you're talking about. Look, don't trust Aaron. I wouldn't trust anybody that ran that scared. Well, Trelawney's a scary guy. You know, what I want to know is what is he doing here? Yeah, and what does he want with the Vesper Diamond? Exactly. So what are we going to do? Do you have everything set up for Sunday night? Sure. Laser refraction alarm on the diamond itself... I'll get a mass spectrograph of the stone today... write out the disable parameters tonight. What about the workhorse programme for the display case? Do you have that? Piece of cake. So do you have any idea how cool this is? An actual diamond heist? It's a diamond switch. We can't let Trelawney or Aaron or Boek end up with the Vesper. It doesn't belong to them. Well, we're doing the break-in... so we can give it to the real owners. Wanna? I don't know. It's going be past dark. Do you think you can stay up that late? Very funny. You know, I've been around the block a few times. Yeah? Literally? Five minutes with me, sugar lips, and you're a woman with a past. I need one. I don't have a past anymore, remember? Look, I apologise all I can. You think I like living like this? Yeah, as crazy as it is, I think you do. Hey. Think fast. - Is this what I think it is? - A diamond in the rough, as they say. - It's not much to look at, is it? - It's up to you. - So did you get the museum diagrams? - Oh, it's all here. Got a copy knocked off. Sonic alarms, motion detectors, guard patrol schedule. Good. What worries me is the laser refraction alarm. They send a beam up through the stone and it refracts in specific ways. I never realised that forgery had to be so perfect. Oh, yeah. If the beam doesn't some off the stone at precisely the right angles... it trips the alarm. So how are you going to get around that? Working on it. Well, I cleared it with Dr Nestor. Dr Carol Nestor? Because there are two Nestors. I know, not Mickey Nestor, he's in Biotech. Carol Nestor, wavy hair, glasses. She wears too much perfume. You know, she's in her second year of civilian grant. Everybody knows it's Star Wars research. Her, you know? You know, I'm still going to call her. All right. I'm loading the exact dimensions of the Vesper. It has 375 facets. It's a very complex cut. Oh, it's easy in here in the virtual world. The problem is with that messy thing we call the real world. Okay. Okay. Let's fire up the lasers. Sort of like cloning a sheep. It's more like... cutting a very, very, very precise lamb chop. That's incredible. That's it? It's done? That's it. - I got something to show you. - Let me see it. Not bad for our first try, huh? It's absolutely perfect. It's not done. Still we need colour. Now, vapour deposit is not the best way to go, but it's fast. As long as it fools Boek. Look, Aaron... the best I'm going to get is a two-micron layer out of this. You dip it in acetone, the joke's over. But I do think by the time the experts get to it, the joke will be on them. Release the tension slowly. - That's it. - I'm stuck. No, you're doing great. No, I'm doing... I need to... I gotta get down. - So how high is it at the museum? - Don't worry about the museum. I'm worried about it at the museum. How high is it? Well, let me put it this way. It's too high for a ladder and not high enough for a parachute. Great, great. That's great news. Thanks. Thanks. This kind of endurance is what separates the girls from the women. Oh, God, don't give me that macho bull. Just get me down. All right. You're coming down. - Thank you. - Nice and easy. You sure you want to do this instead of me? Oh, yeah. I got it covered. All right. Now, this guy, this friend of yours... if he's such an expert thief, why are you doing all the climbing? Well, I guess 'cause that's the part that he wants me to do. He takes care of all the alarm systems. He's the expert. - How do you know this guy? - It's a long story. - So let's keep practising. - Yeah, sure. Wait. This is the stupidest thing I've ever done. No, we're still outside. Stupid is when we're inside. All right. Tell me some good news. I hope the DVD is no prob. The sonic alarms are off... motion detectors are kaput... and I froze the video output on the cameras that cover the diamond display. Now they'll just see what we want them to see. Wait. Sonic alarms are on. Don't do this to me. Okay. Got it. This wall is straight up. Hell, they make them that way. Otherwise, the building falls down. I'm going to be sick. I'm sorry. Let's go. I'm in. All right. I have three clips and 50 million wires. Most of it's redundancy. Find the transformer. Got it. Follow the green wire to the gold interface on the laser system bus. Laser system bus. Yep. All right, rig a bypass to isolate the mass spectrometer. Now I use the programme to re-calibrate so it recognises the fake diamond. Not "the programme," Angela. My programme. All right. Okay. Let's hurry it up. Something's wrong. Angel, freeze. Whatever you're doing, don't move. The motion detectors came on. Oh, don't do this. - Sorcerer. - I can't move. It doesn't make sense. This better work. Come on. Come on. Come on! Got it. Come on. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. Quick. Damn. All right. Hurry. - You think this is cool now? - Oh, yeah. No, I said San Jose. No, Costa Rica, not California. That's right. No, no, no, it's just going to be one-way only. That's fine. In the aisle. Yes, I'll hold. That is one big stone. It'll make three very beautiful smaller pieces... each worth a large fortune. Boek's operation was clumsy, but effective. Scads of broken glass, injured guards. Shoot-and-run, basically. By now he's standing with his superiors... -proudly displaying his catch. -An empty jewellery box. They'll cut him up and feed him to crabs at high tide. Well done, Trelawney. Get on with it. Industrial-grade. Who knew? I wish I would have seen Trelawney's face... when he realised we gave him a piece of cut crystal. Shattered. - And the Vesper Diamond is... - The real one. ...In a diplomatic pouch on its way to the rightful owners. The people of South Africa. So how long have you had a thing for Nelson Mandela? Is that all you ever think about? Just look at me, you know? This body, these... - it's... - It's in there somewhere. You know, I'm in my prime, Angel. My hormones are doing the equivalent of nuclear fusion. Well, push in your control rods. You know, I bet you don't say that to all the guys. Just the ones who are panting. - Yeah, every guy I know, every second. - Yeah. You know, Aaron, too. I saw the way he was looking at you. Creep. Oh, what does it matter, you know? He's long gone. And I would hardly consider him competition. You know, I've been thinking... you know, Aaron is New York City born and bred like me... so he's probably headed off for warmer waters... like Argentina, Costa Rica... Somewhere he thinks Trelawney will never find him. I wish I could find that place. Watch this. Go, dude. For you, fine lady. You are such a cheeseball.
