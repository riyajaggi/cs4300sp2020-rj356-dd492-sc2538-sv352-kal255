 So, I placed a final order for the food tour supplies with Jorge. So no need to worry. Everything's under control. Huh? So now all you need to focus on is having a good time! I don't know how I let you talk me into this. You agreed the food tour was a great idea. You're the one who came up with the #tacostienentumbao. I'm not talking about the food tour. I'm talking about the date with Lupe. I'm not ready. I'm not fucking Drake! I don't know what I was thinking. You were thinking you were gonna be the star of your own rom-com. Which you will if you just chill out. - And you fix that cowlick, right... - Ay! Hey, Chris! Ah... - See what you do? - I was trying to help. You can help by getting outta the way. And you can help by getting outta here. Go, go, go, ándale. I can handle one Morales man stressing me out, but two? Olvídate! - Calm down, Norma. - You know what, Casimiro? You clean up pretty nice. Don't let it get to your head. Now get outta my kitchen, and go bother another woman for a change. Ah, your kitchen? Your kitchen! - Yes, well... - Your kitchen. You don't know. You're not her father! This hurts a lot, cabrón! Hey, Pop, looking good! - Yeah, you've looked worse. - Why are you so serious? Huh? How's Lidia and the baby? - It's nothing. - Should I cancel the date? - Pop, relax! It's fine, all right? - I can cancel. Everything's fine. Go on. Go and enjoy yourself. Keep an eye on your cousin. He's already broken three pitchers. Never better. Ándale. Tell me all the gossip later at the bar. Tell her not to go to Stanford. Please, Erik. I beg you. Okay, make her change her mind, muchacho. I told you, Pancho! Listen, like it or not, this has always been her dream. - We both gotta support it. - What about my dream? My dream of finally being a grandfather, cabrón. You're still gonna be an abuelo! No. She can't go back to San Francisco. Have you tried the barbacoa tacos up there? - They're barba-CACA! - Listen, I'm not talking her out of it. Okay. No more free beer for you, dick! You never gave me free beer in the first place! And now I know why! Wow, Casimiro. How handsome! You look so... - You look so beautiful, Lupe. - Thank you. Mm... Relax, Casimiro. We're going to have a good time. Let's walk? Give me your arm. No. Like this. Let's go. - Have you been here before? - Eh... Seriously, Chris? You're really going through with this shit? Look, I completely understand where you're coming from. No. You don't understand. Welcoming outsiders en masse with open arms like this is pushing people out of their homes - and into the tents around every corner. - I get it. I've been listening to "There Goes The Neighborhood," all right? - But, Yessika, we need the money. - Chris, please. Talk to the organizers! Pull Mama Fina's out of the lineup! - We already printed out the flyers. - Fuck the flyers! We can find other ways to help fundraise for Pop! Oh, really? By doing what? Selling homemade zines on a sliding scale? No. Okay. Sorry. That was a dick move. But we gotta do what we gotta do to save the shop. You think there's only one way to help save the shop? Huh? That your only option is selling out your community? My community? We'll see you Sunday. Wait, what's that mean? - Guess you'll find out. - No, tell me right now! You're still here. ♪ I'm a boss ass bitch, Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch... ♪ Okay. All right, well. As it turns out, Yessika is planning some food tour guerrilla warfare type shit because, apparently, I am responsible for LA's staggering rate of homelessness. And you... you gotta do something about your girl, okay? - All right, all right, deep breaths. - Okay? Deep breaths. - Okay. So, what is Yessika planning? - I don't know. Tag our walls? Burn the place down? Release a pack of feral cats? - Ana, I am deathly allergic to cats. - Okay, dude, she loves Pop, and she loves his shop. I mean, what is she gonna do? Throw bricks through a window in protest? - Oh, God. I didn't even think about that. - Chris! - It was a fucking joke. - We can't afford new windows, Ana. It's my girlfriend you're talking about! She practically grew up in Pop's backyard! You know what? We have bigger problems in Boyle Heights right now. ♪ I'm a boss ass bitch ♪ ♪ Bitch, bitch, bitch... ♪ Oh, my God, Chris. I told you... Oh. Hey, babe. - You gotta talk him out of it. - You know I'm on your side. - Are you, though? - Yes, of course I am! Aren't you always telling me to set boundaries with my family? Yeah. With your time and your art. But this is different! You know, Chris said you were up to something, but, I mean... Are you really gonna protest? Okay, look, I know that you don't like my coconut cousin Chris, but... - his intentions are good. - That's not the point, Ana. Babe... just please, think about Pop. It's just so fucked up! Yeah. This is fun, Lupe. Thank you. What's on your mind? Are you hungry? Do you want some real food? Let's go grab a taco at the shop. You just want to spy on the boys. I just want to make sure they don't burn the place down! If you want to keep working until the day you die, keep it up, chulo. But not me. You want the boys to run the shop someday, right? Then give them space to figure it out on their own. While you figure out... what we're doing next. Hm? I want more days like this, Lupe. Sleeping a lot wouldn't be bad. Have brunch. Do you know what "brunch" means? "BR" is for breakfast. "UNCH" is for lunch. Ah... Yes. Chris taught me that a while back. Yes. What else? Maybe take a day off... or even the whole weekend. Or maybe a week for a cruise? If Chris steps up and helps Erik handle the day-to-day stuff at the shop, - then maybe... - He will. I've seen him do it. I just need to take a step back, a small step, so they can take a step forward. It sounds like you got it all figured out, Casimiro. They need me at the shop. Listen, we gotta do something, Yessika don't play. Hey, hey, hey... Relax! Take a deep breath. Center yourself. Let's just talk to her. Two words: - conflict resolution. - What the hell's gotten into you? I've been listening to Eckhart Tolle's audiobooks. My stillness speaks. Seriously? You've been listening to Eckhart Tolle? You think the path to enlightenment is just for you white-washed Mexicans? What's going on? I thought it was an emergency. Yessika came by. She got in a fight with this fool, and he got scared. That's not accurate. She wants to protest the shop over the food tour. Guys, I was thinking... maybe Yessika was right. Yeah, we need customers, but... maybe this isn't the way to do it. I mean, Chuy finally stopped asking if I could speak Spanish! Oh, okay, Mr. Identity Crisis. We'll pay the rent with your Spanish. Yessika's like family. She won't protest over one event. She just needed to speak her mind. Pop, if she doesn't protest the shop, she'll send her little homegirls to do it. Maybe we could use this to our advantage. Listen, we're not stupid. We understand what foot traffic in this community does. We're fighting for our lives here. We're fighting to save the shop. But how? There's nothing gentrifiers hate more than being called gentrifiers. Yeah. That's a good point. That's exactly what Yessika's protest does. It'll scare away our hipster foodies by tapping into their biggest fear. - Brown lesbians? - White guilt. Oh... So, how do we get them to cross the picket line and spend more of their money on our specialty menu? Don't worry. It was a rhetorical question. Let's lean into the spectacle of it all. Create a piece of next-level immersive performance art. - Ah, okay. I still don't get it. - What? Let's make the protest seem like it's part of the food tour! Like George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum! Teatro Campesino and it's satirization of the foreman-fieldworker relationships! - Pass. - I met Cesar Chavez once. He really loved buche tacos. Really? I would've thought he was more of an asada man. - No, no. Buche. - Nayeli. What do I always tell you to do when you're selling your chocolates for your school fundraiser? Pick a shirt from the bottom of the hamper, don't brush my hair, - look extra poor? - And what happens? I sell out in an hour. Exactly! It's performance, it's... It's a stereotype. It's a reclaiming of a narrative. Okay. Okay, all right. I... - don't get it yet. - Of course you don't get it. Erik, let's school this fool. Let's. Bro, we gotta send a signal to the rest of Boyle Heights. A show of solidarity, like a warning to any other locals thinking about pulling this kind of shit. You know I love stunting on a megaphone, but this is Mama Fina's. Not some new brunch spot serving 18-dollar churro waffles. Okay, but we can't make an exception when it comes to accountability? How many of our parents call Pop compadre? How many times did we go there after school growing up? How many of us knew we could be queer, brown, and badass thanks to Norma? This isn't about Pop or Norma. This is about coconut-ass Chris crossing a line. - This is about Pop trying to survive. - Yeah! But at our expense! Yessika, this is our neighborhood. And what they're doing is putting us at risk. Uh-huh. Ana has to do something. Oh, shit. What? Mm-mmm... Oh, my God! It's Mama Fina's! No justice. No tacos. Eat shit, Christopher Columbus! That's right, Christopher Columbus! - Eat shit! Get out! - Hey! Get out! - What's up homeboy? - Oh, you're a cholo. You tired of Echo Park, huh? Over the breweries in the art district, in Boyle Heights? 'Cause you heard Mama Fina has the best tacos in LA! Well, you heard right, fool! This Sunday, come take a bite of Boyle Heights... before it's gone forever. Ah... Please. Please... Not only do you get to go on a food tour, you also get to participate in a sweet-ass live protest, which means you get to help out a small family business while also checking your privilege! Go get your tickets now on Eventbrite down below! Below! And we'll see you at... Mama Fina's! - Fuck. - Now do you get it? We have to do something about this! We don't have to stop eating there, though, right? - Right? - Girl. Natalia! "Before it's gone forever!" Shoot. There's like a fine line between satire and stereotype, and they crossed it. Ain't nothing funny about that shit! - Okay, wait, but this is my family. - And this is our neighborhood. They're just trying to make a buck. We get it, they're trying to survive. But this isn't the way. Why are we surprised? They're a bunch of sellouts. - Like their vendida cousin. - No, bitch. Don't call her no sellout. If she wasn't your girlfriend, would you be saying that? I know how this looks, babe. But this is Chris's doing. He's not from around here. He doesn't know any better. Look, I can't tell Pop not to do what he needs to do to save the shop. Just like I can't tell you not to do what you need to do to defend Boyle Heights. I'll see you later. Today is a new day at Mama Fina's. The day we stake our claim to victory. All the hard work, the sacrifice has led us to this moment. But make no mistake. It will take everything we got. And I mean everything. - Including these brand-new uniforms. - I am not wearing that bougie Mangiashit. - Yeah, hard pass. Hard pass. - I'm not taking fashion advice from you. Okay, but it looks clean, it looks great. I was trying to pump you guys up. Come on. - Okay. Hold on. - Come on. Come on... It's one small step for man. And woman. One giant leap for Mama Fina's. Fine. Whatever. - Thanks. - I got you, Li' Bro. I'm gonna airdrop the playlist, so you guys can dress up to it. Okay? Golly, we are a good-looking group of bunch of peoples! Okay, let's get it! Morales on three! A-one, a-two... Okay, we're done here, fool. Let's go, come on. Do I even look like a Morales? - Oh, mijo. - It's all right! Ain't nobody gonna bring me down! I am pumped! I am ready for battle! Let's go! I can high five myself! Let's get it! Here. Let's do this. Bring it in, bring it in. Remember, this is our community. It's not theirs, it is ours. Let's shout at them, let it be known. Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí... We're live in Boyle Heights at a beloved taco shop that's serving up some controversy. Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí. Gentrify... Ready? This is, like, so cool. We can get tacos and make a difference. Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí. Gentrify no! Gente sí... Well, you've got your watermelon radish carne asada. You know, you look like a vegan barbacoa and brussels kinda guy. Try the Masala Morales. The best! This is definitely our new Taco Tuesday hang. Why do we eat so much at those other spots? These are amaze! - Order up! Seventy-nine! - Seventy-nine! Yeah? Okay. Gout is not contagious! This is outrageous! Gout is not contagious! This is outrageous! Please take my resume. I have references! Will carne asada tear this neighborhood apart? Find out more at eleven. I think we didn't make enough for the tour, son. Well, they're not all from the tour, Pop. If people see lines out the front door, they wanna get in them. Psych 101. Get a job, losers! - Gente sí. Gentrify no! - Uch. I feel bad. Gente sí. Gentrify no! What? Connie's been a regular at Taco Tuesday since I can remember. We gotta do something. Yeah. Send the old guy and the cute kid to make nice. Real original, cuz. Free horchata! Mama Fina's loves you all, even if you don't love us back! Drink one. It's hot out. Natalia, don't you dare. You know I have to hydrate every 37 minutes or I get faint. - Oh! - Ay! Sorry, Pops. We defend the hood! We don't sell it! We defend the hood! We don't sell it! What are you doing? Yessi, seriously? I care about this community, Pop. So do I. I'm part of the community. Then why bring these people here? You're better than this, Pop. Look at them. You're selling our soul, and they're buying. Yessika! This is wrong. Maybe you don't see it now, but in the short or long run, - this community will suffer! - What the hell are you doing? None of this started happening until you got here. You think this is happening because of me? I told you, the landlord tried to evict us. Oh, did the landlord create this fucking food tour? Did the landlord create that dumbass video? No! You did. It was my idea! - What? - I came up with the video. And it worked! Listen, if it's us against them, I choose us. You got a problem with that? I do. - Hey, what the hell is going on? - Why don't you ask your girlfriend here? Please. We defend the hood! We don't sell it! We defend the hood! We don't sell it! We defend the hood! We don't sell it! We defend the hood! We don't sell it! Yo! Even with Yessika acting all Norma Rae, we cleared three times what we expected. We made enough rent for next month. What? Yo, we do this a couple more times, we can stash up enough cash. Lock in the new lease at the same rate. Booya, Rob! - May God hear you. - Hey, nothing talks like money. - Proud of you, cuz. - Hey, what are you talking about? It was your idea that got attention. I'm proud of both of you. Oh, okay! Okay... - What's wrong? - I gotta... Uh... - Come on, man. - I gotta... - I gotta return the camera we borrowed. - Okay, come on. We could've hugged a little longer, bro. Come on. Sit down. I want to talk to you. Everything all right, Pop? Today was hard, son. But we got through it. Yeah, we did. - You did this. - No! We all did, together. I always hoped one of you would step up and take over the taco shop. Like a real partner that I could rely on. But that never happened... Until today. I know you want to be a prestigious chef. With everything. But why not do all that here, son? You and Erik worked together... really well. Why not do that every day? So I can sleep in once in a while? I don't... I don't know what to say, Pop. Say yes. Make this old man happy. Like, I don't understand. How could you step to Pop like that? He asked me to come talk to him. What was I supposed to do? Say no? It would've been better than yelling at him! I wasn't yelling at him, Ana. I was trying to talk to him, and then Thing 1 and Thing 2 jumped in and came at me like I was being court-martialed. And then you joined the fucking battalion, and y'all treated me like I'm some angry black girl? Let's be real. Your family has never accepted me. - Yessika, that's just my mom... - No, it is not! No, it's not! Erik has never been down for us! And Chris? - He just got here, but he still doesn't... - I don't care what my family thinks! Yes, you do. You're always putting them first. You're always running to go help them. And when it's not them, it's running to go do work for Tim. That's what this is all about. This is about Tim. And you not supporting the fact that I'm finally doing the shit that I've dreamed about for years. I finally have someone who believes in my work! I've always believed in your work. Yeah? But I'm finally getting paid. Your little white savior is tearing up our neighborhood block by block. How many people in the homeless town were displaced due to his beautifying projects? Hmm? Face it. You are part of the problem, Ana. And you can't separate the two. And if you think he is just your benefactor, girl, wake up! Homeboy is your pimp. You are just the latest flavor of the month at his fucking paletería. And he's just gonna keep showing you off until he wears you out and discovers a new little token to claim as his latest find. Next week he'll have some gender-fluid, one-eyed, albino Korean to showcase in his traveling fucking circus. Fuck you. Fuck you! I'm done. I been done. Big day, huh? Sorta. Heard you're gonna be on the news. I hope they get your good side. Shit. - They're all my good side. - Oh, word? You know. Your dad came by yesterday. Oh, God. He's having a hard time since you accepted Stanford. You know my dad. He loves to jump to conclusions. I mean, I haven't even said yes yet. But I want to. Of course. I'm huge. You are. I've been thinking. Come with me to Stanford. I... Ooh. I think my water just broke. Oh, fuck.
