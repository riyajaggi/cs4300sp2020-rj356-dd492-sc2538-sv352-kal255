 [grunting] [screaming] [roaring] [instrumental music] Spring Break in New Orleans. This is the coolest! Huh? Aah! crash [slurps] Ha ha ha ha ha. [laughing] Which way to the hotel, Shaggy? Beats me. It's in one of these brochures. Let's see.. There it is! Leland Gables. According to the map, it's just north of here through that graveyard. Yipe! Graveyard? (Daphne) This cemetery sure is spooky. (Fred) And weird. There's no graves. Yeah. Just these cute little cabanas. They're called "fours," the ground here is too swampy for regular burials. They've used these above-ground tombs for hundreds of years. [roaring] Look! Ghosts! Run! Climb on, mes amis.Vite! 'Allons! Allons!' Hoo! You were lucky, mes cheres. Another minute, and you would have met les freres Leland! Like, run that by me again. He said, the Leland brothers. See? French Club pays off! Who are the Leland brothers? The brothers were on opposite sides during that Civil War. They hated each other so much they fought a duel right here in the family graveyard. They continue to fight here every night. [gulps] How do you know all this, anyway? Well, it's my business to know for I am Crawdad Mike your guide for the bestest haunted tour of New Orleans. [laughing] Alright! [laughs] Thanks for the lift, Mr. Mike. Like, we're staying here? No way. - No way! - Okay! You and Scooby can stay out here next to the graveyard. Well, since either choice is like Creepsville I'll choose the one that might have a kitchen. I tell you, Lorelei, you're just plum crazy! You've got no choice but to sell! That's Leland land. Cyrus Buford, you may be the boss over at your resort but right here, I'm in charge. Now, I'll thank you to leave. As you can see, I have guests! Yes, and I'm sure you kids'll enjoy your stay! If you survive, that is. Survive? Now, don't you pay that Cyrus Buford any mind. Welcome, y'all. I'm Lorelei Leland. So, Lorelei, who was that guy giving you a hard time? Cyrus T. Buford. He wants to buy the Leland family cemetery so he can expand the Rivergate. That's his hotel and water park and he's trying to use the legend of the Leland ghosts to make me sell. That was no legend we saw in the graveyard. You saw them? Yup, and they're one gruesome twosome. [gasping] There they are again! Those are just portraits, Shaggy. That's right, of my great- great-great-great grand uncles Union Jed and Rebel Caleb. Jeepers! - Yikes! - Ghost! [laughs] That's no ghost. That's just my brother Taylor. What's the big idea scaring the chitlins out of our guests? Oh. Sorry, Lorelei. I was just, uh.. ...tidying up the rooms. [Shaggy gulps] 'Like, nice work.' [teeth chattering] Oh, there, there. Now, what happened here? That's all that's left of Scooby's Mardi Gras costume. Well, that won't do at all. Everyone needs a costume at Mardi Gras time. Yeah! But for now, you must be tired. Have a good night, y'all. Now, you kids best not be going out into the cemetery. - You hear? - Ha ha ha. We hear you, man. Loud and clear. 'Cause you know what they say about old Jed and Caleb. Every night, they appear looking for new recruits to drag into their armies of the undead. [chuckles] Did you guys notice something odd about Taylor's shoes? Leave it to Daphne to notice a fashion faux pas. I'm not talking fashion. I'm talking mud. It was all over his boots. He must've been outside recently but why this late at night? Hmm. Oh, boy, I can't believe we're back in the cemetery in the middle of the night. It's such a shame that Lorelei might have to sell her house. There must be something we can do. Like, zoinks! Huh! Ghost! Ghost! That's no ghost, Scooby. 'It's just an old possum.' And he's got my hot-pepper po' boy! After him, Scoob! [instrumental music] Whoa! Help! I've been grabbed by a ghoulish ghost! Oh! Ho-ho-ho! - No! - That was no ghost. It was just a plain old skeleton, see? [screams] Like, that's supposed to make me feel better? - Oh, no! - Daphne, what is it? There's icky gunk all over my new shoes. Jinkies! I bet that's a clue! Hey, Daph, how you going to get back with only one shoe? You know me. I always come prepared. (Velma) 'Hmm, if that's our first clue' I wonder how this is connected to the Leland legend. We should talk to an expert and I know just the man. Any idea what this is, Crawdad? [sniffs] Oh, mais oui, chere. They call this the ectoplasm. Ectoplasm! That's what ghosts are made out of. You mean we've been carrying around ghost guts? - Yech! - I'm not so sure. O, mon petit, I know all that's to know about the ghostses in this city, me and for just $5 each I give y'all the VIP tour! Maybe another time. Right now, we have work to do. And, before that, we have dinner to eat. Hey, Scoob, how's your ice-cream mushroom-pizza milkshake gumbo? [slurps] Delicious! Yeah, but, like, it needs some hot sauce. [chuckles] This looks like the one.. '"Five Skull Fire Sauce."' [slurps] [whistles] Mmm. Legend has it the Leland Ghosts keep coming back. - But why? - Hey, there's Lorelei! Lorelei! Lorelei! She didn't hear me. I wonder what she could be looking for in that store. (Shaggy) "Supermarket of the Supernatural?" Zoinks! [instrumental music] Wh-what did you see? (Shaggy) 'Lorelei bought...bat wings..' '...chicken bones..' '...and the eye of a toad.' Mm. Sounds like voodoo. [both gulp] Voodoo? The next stop for clues, Cyrus Buford's water park. Like, can't we ever detour around the graveyard? Hey, gang. Check that out! It's Taylor! (Velma) 'And it looks like he's carrying a uniform.' A Confederate uniform. But what's tall, dark and gruesome doing walking through the graveyard in the middle of the night? Being scary, and he's doing a great job. (Fred) We need to see if Cyrus Buford is connected to those uncivil Civil War ghosts. Now, let's split up and look for clues. Ah, Fred. I might've found a clue. Great. Where is it? [growls] [screaming] [roaring] I hope you've got a plan, Freddy. Of course I do. Run! * You remind me of a man What man * * Yeah the man with the power * * What power Yeah the power of voodoo * * Who do Yeah yeah you do you do * * Do what * * Oh winkem dinkum Knottomous rex * * Save us from the man with the hex * * Save us from his evil curse * * It's going to get bad Yeah it's going to get worse * * Hocus pocus alakazam Save us from that evil man * * With hairy legs and heavy feet * * He cracks up pavement as he creeps * [instrumental music] * You remind me of a man What man * * Yeah the man with the power What power * * Oh the power of voodoo Who do * * Yeah yeah you do you do Do what * * You remind me of a man What man * * Yeah the man with the power What power * * Oh the power of the voodoo Who do * * Yeah yeah you do you do Do what ** [music continues] [gasping] (Velma) 'Cyrus Buford?' Just what are y'all doing here? We're trying to get the bottom of the Leland Brothers mystery. Well, you kids should not be running around here at night. - It's dangerous. - Like, you're telling us? Those crazy brothers chased us all over this place. You've seen them too? Those ghosts scared off my whole staff. Without them, I can't open this place. It was my life's dream to have the finest resort and water park in New Orleans. Maybe you shouldn't have built it near a graveyard. I've sunk all my life's savings into this land and now no slimy soldiers are going to get the best of Cyrus T. Buford. Wait a minute, gang. Where's Daphne? (Shaggy and Velma) She's gone. Gone? [instrumental music] (Fred) If the ghost kidnapped Daphne this is where they'd bring her. Well, somebody was generous enough 'to leave fresh footprints.' Like, ghosts don't leave footprints. Do they? They do if they're wearing Civil War boots. Then if we follow the footprints we're sure to find Daphne. [sniffs] Oh. Oh! Ah-ah-ah-a-choo! Gesundheit, man. Oh, no! We've lost the trail of footprints! Now we have no way of knowing where they were leading. You and I will explore the graveyard. Shaggy and Scooby, stay out here and guard the gate and don't let anybody in or out. Uh, like, who would be coming out of a cemetery? There's no trace of them anywhere. Well, I always say, "The best plan to make is to make a plan." clunk Hey, what was that? I think you set off those lights by sitting on that rock. Impossible. Very possible. And they seem to coming from way up in that treetop. Now, what in the world could this be? [Shaggy and Scooby whistling] [howling] Tell me that's you wailing, Scoob. Huh? Uh-uh, uh-uh. [howling] Wait. That's a girl's voice. Scoob, it could Daphne. Now, how do we find her? Great idea. Daphne answers her cellphone no matter what. I've even got her on speed dial. Let's see. "Fred, pizza, Velma, groceries Teriyaki Bowl, mom, Daphne." [cellphone ringing] That's her phone. Follow the ring. [ringing continues] Daphne! Don't worry, Daph. Scoob and I are here. [Shaggy grunts] [instrumental music] Uh-oh. Okay, Fred. The whole's nice and deep. Thanks, Vel. I built a foolproof trap. Anyone coming through here in the dark will trip over those barrels and shoot down the water slide. 'They'll get instantly caught up by that wire spring.' It's attached to that big catapult. When I hear the sproing sound, I pull the trigger, which will catapult the culprit right into your moss covered pit. Great plan, huh? I admire the simplicity. [Daphne grunts] I was grabbed by those two slimy soldiers. I can't budge this knot. We've gotta hurry. They could be back any second. Wait, I know. Five Skull Fire Sauce should burn through anything. sizzle sizzle Like, uh, he's locked. It's the old eyelash curler metal dog tag technique. Of course, man. Why wouldn't I think of that? [clanking] Sweet. [all gasp] Somebody's coming. I'm ready. Wait. Hold on, I-I think that might be Daphne? [Shaggy screaming] Whoa-a! [Shaggy yelling] boink boink boink [grunting] Uh, zoinks. And lots more zoinks. [grunting] Ah-ha! Get us out of here. Nice Mardi Gras costume, Scoob. You really had us going there. What's going on? I think this duo has come to an end. I'll bet Taylor is behind this. (Fred) 'With Cyrus T Buford?' But there's still one more suspect. (All) Crawdad Mike? (Velma) 'And his driver.' 'Who helped him steer a high speed scare.' So why were you going into that supernatural shop, Lorelei? I was looking for a talisman to keep the evil spirits away. And a ghastly mask for Scooby's costume. Oh. Wanks. And Taylor, if you weren't playing ghost, why were you sneaking around with that Confederate soldiers costume? It was a old family heirloom. I had to sell it to help pay the bills. I snuck out at night because I didn't want Lorelei to know. But I still can't figure out what the heck was going on. Yikes! They're back! [whimpering] Calm down, you two. You were just watching a hologram. Projected from that treetop. It's set off by pressure on this rock. Each time the tour bus pulled off the road the driver used dry ice to make a perfect background mist for projecting ghosts. (Daphne) 'Dry ice fog leaves a residue.' That's the gunk I found on my shoe. (Velma) 'Crawdad Mike had a smooth operation going.' Frightening the tourists with his ghosts and making a busload of cash. He got worried when we came close to exposing him. That's when he and his driver dressed up as the ghosts brothers and kidnapped Daphne to scare us away. Sacre bleu. I would have gone away with it too. If it weren't for your meddling kids. I wonder how you say meddling kids in French. [all laughing] But why were you so sure they weren't the Leland Brothers? Notice in the picture, Jed is much taller than Caleb. The ghosts that haunted us were exactly the same height. I'm sure glad y'all could make it to the party. We just got a great reason to celebrate. We've decided to partner up in an exciting new venture. Leland Land. [chuckles] Sure did. And I can finally open up my resort hotel and water park that I always dreamed about in my dreams. I'll run the theme restaurant right here in the house. And I'll be guiding authentic tours of the Leland Family Cemetery. Yeah. Partners. Excellent. We'll look forward to vacationing at Leland Land land. [all laugh] Did I thank you guys for saving me? Thank yourself, Daph. We never would've known you were there if you hadn't wailed so loud for help. But I never called for help. I was gagged, remember? I could hardly make a sound. [howling] [all gasp] Huh? Scooby dooby do-o-o. [theme music] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
