Computer: TURN RIGHT AHEAD. Fred: RIGHT IT IS, NATLAS. I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A LEFT, FREDDY. Computer: ANOTHER RIGHT TURN AHEAD. I CAN'T. THERE'S NOWHERE TO TURN. I THINK YOUR NAVIGATOR IS HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, FREDDY. NO WAY! NATLAS IS A STATE-OF-THE-ART GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM. IT CAN GUIDE US TO WITHIN 5 INCHES OF OUR PROGRAMMED DESTINATION. Computer: GO LEFT FIRST. YOU HAVE NOW ARRIVED AT SUNSET BEACH. PLEASE ENJOY YOUR DAY AT THE SHORE. OH? HEE HEE HEE HEE. LOOK, EVERYBODY! THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE LOCAL NEWS ABOUT THE CONTEST. AND MAKING HIS GRAND ENTRANCE INTO THE SNOWBOARDING COMPETITION BEARING HIS NAME, SOFTWARE BILLIONAIRE BRUCE WILKINSON. MR. WILKINSON-- HEY, THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE MYSTERY MACHINE. IT IS THE MYSTERY MACHINE! WATCH THE ROAD, FREDDY! WHOA, FRED! GREAT PARKING KARMA! WHOA, SWEET FRONTSIDE AIR. HEY, YOU'RE GRETCHEN MUELLER. YOU'VE BEEN WINNING CONTESTS ALL OVER EUROPE. LUCKY BOY. YOU WILL WATCH ME WIN HERE AS WELL. CIAO. AND HOW WILL THESE HIGH-PROFILE GAMES BE AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF OLYMPIC BRONZE MEDALIST CHRIS KLUG UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES? NANCY, I'M SURE WITH A MILLION DOLLARS AT STAKE, THE OTHER COMPETITORS WILL BE HUNGRY FOR VICTORY. CHRIS KLUG INJURED? "MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES"? $1 MILLION?! HUNGRY? I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH CHRIS KLUG. TALK TO CHRIS KLUG?! COOL! YOU KNOW IN ASPEN WHEN YOU NAILED THAT 720 MID-TWIST, THEN GRABBED SOME FLYING SQUIRREL IN THE VERY NEXT MOVE? YEAH, FRED, RIGHT. THAT WAS SO COOL! THANKS, BRO. I'M JUST BUMMED I WON'T BE SHREDDIN' THE POW HERE, THANKS TO THAT SUPERSIZE POPSICLE. POPSICLE?! WHERE?! SCOOB AND I ARE, LIKE, FAMISHED. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SO YOU REALLY WERE ATTACKED BY SOME KIND OF CREATURE? YEAH. TRIPPY, HUH? HMM. THE BEST WAY TO GET A HANDLE ON THE MYSTERY IS FROM THE INSIDE. I'LL POSE AS ONE OF THE PRO-BOARDERS. BUT, FREDDY, THE MONSTER! MONSTER?! YO, AVALANCHE, IT'S TRUE. FULL-ON SNOW CREATURE. HMM. FREAKY. I BELIEVE YOU, MAN. A SERIOUS COMPETITOR LIKE YOU WOULD NEVER PURPOSELY QUIT. AVALANCHE ANDERSON! WOW! YOU PRACTICALLY INVENTED THE SPORT! I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOUR MOVIES SINCE I WAS A KID! YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR?! NO, NO. I JUST DID SOME ACTION MOVIES WITH SNOWBOARDING CHASES. [BURP] Daphne: OH, NO. SCOOBY! HA HA HA. SCOOBY. SCOOBY'S GONNA NEED THAT EXTRA FUEL TO KEEP HIM WARM WHILE WE SEARCH EVERY TRAIL FOR THE SNOW CREATURE. COME ON, VELMA. TIME'S A-WASTIN'! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! NO OFFENSE, VELMA, BUT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD BE KNOCKING DOWN GIANT BOWLING PINS! BOWLING PINS. I DON'T GET IT. HMM HMM. HA HA! VERY FUNNY. YOU'LL BE LAUGHING THROUGH YOUR HANDKERCHIEF WHEN I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T CAUGHT A COLD. SHH, GUYS! SOMEONE'S COMING. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW, MORTY?! HOW ABOUT NOW? YES, I KNOW WE NEED HIGHER RATINGS. YES! DON'T WORRY. I THINK I CAN VIRTUALLY PROMISE YOU MORE VIEWERS. WAIT. YOU'RE BREAKING UP AGAIN. HMM, INTERESTING. YEAH, YOU'D THINK YOU CAN GET A LOT CLEARER SIGNAL UP HERE. NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS I WONDER HOW SHE CAN GUARANTEE HIGHER RATINGS. GUYS! LOOK! SNOW CREATURE! I DON'T THINK SO, SCOOBY, UNLESS CHRIS WAS EXAGGERATING. THAT MYSTERY SNEAK SURE ISN'T MADE OF ICE AND SNOW. I DON'T CARE IF HE'S MADE OF NO-FAT FROZEN YOGURT! LET'S GET LOST! I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. LET'S FOLLOW HIM! Daphne: IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS HEADED TO THAT OLD, ABANDONED SKI JUMP. [RUMBLING] SCOOBY, IS THAT YOUR STOMACH RUMBLING? UH-UH. WELL, THAT NOISE IS GETTING LOUDER. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS? WHY DON'T YOU ASK [GULP] HIM?! [ROARING] Fred: OK, GUYS, DON'T PANIC! REMEMBER, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT'S JUST A TERRIFYING MONSTER SUIT WITH SOME CREEP INSIDE. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MISSING FROM YOUR THEORY, FRED. WHAT? LIKE, THE CREEP INSIDE! [ALL SCREAMING] Fred: HEY! YEAH! WHY DON'T YOU PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE?! WHOA! UNH! OW! MY LEG! GET THAT OUTTA MY FACE! HUH? WHAT'S GOING ON?! YOUR FRIEND HERE JUST BROKE HIS LEG. WHO ARE YOU? THEODORE--TRAIL MANAGER. I KEEP THE SLOPES GROOMED, CHAIR LIFTS RUNNIN', AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE I'M A TAXI SERVICE FOR CLUMSY KIDS, TOO! DIDN'T YOU SEE THE ICE CREATURE? AW, QUIT YOUR CRAZY TALK AND HELP ME GET MR. GRACEFUL INTO THE SNOW CAT. THAT THEODORE GAVE ME A SERIOUS CASE OF THE CREEPS. I THINK OUR FRIEND THEODORE COULD BEAR A CLOSER EXAMINATION. NO, THANKS! WE WERE CLOSE ENOUGH IN THAT SNOWCAT. SHEESH! AH-CHOO! THINK ABOUT IT. HE SHOWED UP JUST AFTER WE SAW THE CREATURE. WHY? GOOD POINT! LET'S CHECK HIM OUT. YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. YOU'RE GOING TO REST, JUST LIKE THE DOCTOR SAID. WE'LL GO INVESTIGATE. Velma: HERE'S THEODORE'S CABIN, JUST LIKE THE DESK CLERK SAID. I HOPE HE DOESN'T MIND IF WE LOOK AROUND. JEEPERS. LOOKS LIKE HE DECORATED IN RUSTIC, MID-CENTURY CREEP. AH-AH-AH-CHOO! YOU OK? VELMA, MAYBE WE SHOULD GET YOU SOME HOT SOUP, LIKE, BACK AT THE LODGE. I'M NOT TOO SICK TO RECOGNIZE A CLUE WHEN I SEE ONE. LOOK! "CHAMPION SKI JUMPER THEODORE SCHUSSMAN'S CAREER "TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT WHEN HE COLLIDED WITH A YOUNG MAN ON A SO-CALLED SNOWBOARD." HMM. HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD. HE'S GOT MORE CUPS HERE THAN AN ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP. Velma: JINKIES, A SKIING CHAMPION WHO LOST HIS CAREER TO A SNOWBOARDER MUST BE PRETTY BITTER. GESUNDHEIT. JEEPERS. YOUR SNEEZES ARE GETTING LOUDER, VELMA. THAT'S NOT ME. IT CAME FROM OUTSIDE. [ROARING] ZOINKS! I TELL YA, THAT SNOWMAN IS DEFINITELY NOT A JOLLY, HAPPY SOUL! Man: AAH! HELP! MONSTER! All: AVALANCHE ANDERSON! I'M TELLIN' YOU, DOC, IT WAS MADE TOTALLY OF ICE AND SNOW. OW! THAT ANKLE'S PRETTY TENDER. WE CAN TAKE YOU IN FOR X-RAYS. WHAT'S THE POINT? I'M OUT OF THE CONTEST. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. WILL YOU KIDS LEAVE ME ALONE? I'VE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS. WITH ALL THE BIG NAMES LEAVING, MY SPONSORS ARE PULLING OUT OF THE GAMES. PLEASE LISTEN. FREDDY'S PLAN IS BRILLIANT. THE WAY I SEE IT, THE CREATURE'S TARGETING PROFESSIONAL BOARDERS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO STICK A DECOY INTO THE COMPETITION. I THINK ALL THIS SNOW CREATURE BUSINESS IS A LOT OF HOO-HA, BUT IF IT'LL GET YOU OFF MY BACK, FINE. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME... THERE'S SOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THAT BOSSY BILLIONAIRE. I DON'T GET IT, FRED. WITH YOUR BUSTED ANKLE, WHO'S GOING TO BE THE DECOY? REAH. WHO? HUH? HUH? [GULP] NO WAY! NEGATORY! NOT GONNA HAPPEN! COME ON, SHAGGY. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU REALLY HAVE TO SNOWBOARD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FAKE IT AND WAIT FOR THAT CREATURE TO COME AFTER YOU. HERE THEY COME. CATCH YOU LATER. SO, YOU ARE THE HEAVY-HITTER, LAST-MINUTE ENTRY WE ARE HEARING ABOUT. YEP. THAT'S ME, THE INVINCIBLE SHAGINATOR. HMM. SO YOU THINK YOU'RE INVINCIBLE, SHAGINATOR? ZOINKS! AAH! SHAGINATOR CERTAINLY HAS AN UNORTHODOX STYLE. HEY, I'M, LIKE, STILL ALIVE! [ROARING] HEY! WHOA! OHH! AAH! SHAGGY? WHOAAA! AH-HA-HO! WHOA! [ROAR] [ROAR] [LAUGHING] WHOA! WHEW! WHEW! [ROAR] YOU TOTALLY SAVED US! LIKE, THANKS. Velma: THERE WAS ALL THIS STUFF ON THE NET ABOUT WILKINSON SELLING OFF BIG CHUNKS OF HIS EMPIRE TO PAY HIS CREDITORS. AH-AH-AH-CHOO! [CRASH] VELMA, YOU'RE TOO SICK TO THINK. YOU CLIMB INTO BED AND REST. HEY, IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP, THE ROOMS ALL HAVE A BIG STACK OF OLD SNOWBOARDING MOVIES ON DVD. OH, LUCKY ME! FREDDY, LOOK! THERE'S A LIGHT FLICKERING AT THE TOP OF THE SKI JUMP. WHERE'S MY NIGHT-VISION SCOPE? TRÈS CONVENIENT! HEY, CHECK IT OUT. THERE'S THAT WEIRD GUY FROM LAST NIGHT. I WONDER WHAT HE WAS DOING IN THE SKI-JUMP GATE? I'LL GO FIND OUT. OW! YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE, MISTER. DOCTOR'S ORDERS. THIS TIME, DAPHNE'S FLYING SOLO. NO WAY. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR-- FOR WHAT? FOR A GIRL? I'LL BE PERFECTLY SAFE. WELL, I GUESS I CAN WATCH OVER YOU FROM HERE AND CALL YOUR CELL PHONE IF I SEE ANYTHING. BUT BE CAREFUL! AW, FREDDY, AREN'T I ALWAYS? YEAH! [CELL PHONE RINGS] HELLO? YOU CALL THAT CAREFUL? OH, FREDDY, RELAX. THERE'S NOTHING-- HEY! WHAT'S THIS? DAPHNE, GET OUT OF THERE. THE CREATURE'S COMING! IT'S COMING! WHAT DID YOU SAY? I DIDN'T CATCH THAT. [GRRR] JEEPERS! I THINK I JUST GOT THE MESSAGE! [ROAR] [ROAR] EAT PRO-INTENSITY STYLING HEAT, SLUSH-FACE! [ROAR] GET OUTTA THERE! WHEW! MMM-MMM! MY FAMOUS GARLIC, RED CHILI, ONION, TABASCO SAUCE CONSOMMÉ OUGHT TO FIGHT OFF THAT CHILL. I THOUGHT I'D FIND YOU TWO HERE. [MUTTERING] COME ON, GUYS, YOU JUST HAVE TO COMPETE. THE WILKINSON EMPIRE IS RELYING ON THESE GAMES. SORRY, RICH DUDE, NO CAN DO. WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? SHH! SHAGGY, LOOK! [DIALS] IT'S ME. THAT NANCY CHANG WAS THERE LISTENING THE ENTIRE TIME. AND REMEMBER HOW DESPERATE FOR RATINGS SHE IS? VERY STRANGE. AH-AH-CHOO! NOT AS STRANGE AS A BILLIONAIRE WITH NO BILLIONS. AT LEAST THE CONTESTANTS HAVE MOTIVES, LIKE A MILLION ONE-DOLLAR MOTIVES TO BE EXACT. HEY, WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT CREEPY OLD THEODORE. RIGHT, OR THAT MYSTERY SNEAK. AH-CHOO! HOW IS THIS MYSTERY CONNECTED TO THE CREATURE? AND HOW DO WE STOP THAT FROZEN FREAK? HMM. I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT "HMM." IT ALWAYS COMES RIGHT BEFORE FRED'S PLAN, AND THE PLAN USUALLY ENTAILS YOU AND ME BEING... RIVE RAIT? YEAH! "RIVE RAIT!" HEY, SNOWMAN, CHECK IT OUT! I GOT YOUR CORNCOB PIPE AND YOUR BUTTON NOSE RIGHT HERE! HUH? NOT NOW, SCOOB. I'M ON A ROLL. [RUMBLING] SCOOB, DON'T TELL ME THERE'S A HUGE, UGLY SNOW CREATURE RIGHT BEHIND US. YEAH. LIKE, I ASKED YOU NOT TO TELL ME THAT! AAH! AAH! THEN VELMA PULLS THE ROPE, TOPPLING THE SLALOM DRUMS ONTO MR. SNOW-MEISTER, AND DAPHNE BLASTS HIM WITH THE SNOW-MAKING MACHINE. THIS COLD IS KILLING ME. AH...AH...AH... HERE THEY COME! LIKE, GANGWAY! [ROAR] AH...AH...AH-CHOO! * LA LA LA LA * * LA LA LA LA * HUH? HUH? AAH! AAH! * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * IN A MAD, MAD TOWN * * LEFT AND RIGHT, I'M OUT OF SIGHT * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * IN A MAD, MAD TOWN * * UPSIDE DOWN, I'M TURNED AROUND * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * TODAY HE'S GONNA WANT 'EM DUE * * AND LEAD A TRAIL RIGHT BACK TO YOU * * I THRASH AND DO SOME VOODOO, TOO * * IT DON'T WORRY ME * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * IN A MAD, MAD TOWN * * LEFT AND RIGHT, I'M OUT OF SIGHT * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * IT'S A RAD, RAD, WORLD * * IN A MAD, MAD TOWN * * UPSIDE DOWN, I'M TURNED AROUND * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * OFF THE RAIL, I'M BANGED AND BRUISED * * SLOW OR SLAM, I STILL CAN'T CHOOSE * * WAIKIKI, ON SOME IT'S COOL * * IT WON'T BURY ME * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * IN A MAD, MAD TOWN * * LEFT AND RIGHT, I'M OUT OF SIGHT * *IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * *IN A MAD, MAD TOWN * *LEFT AND RIGHT, I'M OUT OF SIGHT * * IT'S A RAD, RAD WORLD * [ROAR] OH, NO, YOU DON'T. SO, MR. FROSTY-FREEZY WAS A FAKE AFTER ALL. HE'S MADE ENTIRELY OF SOME KIND OF SEE-THROUGH LUCITE FASHIONED TO LOOK LIKE ICE, EVEN THE MOVING PARTS. SURE. THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T MELT HIM WITH MY DRIER. BUT IF HE'S REMOTE-CONTROLLED, WHO'S HOLDING THE REMOTE? LOOK! UP THERE! Shaggy: IT'S THAT MYSTERY SNEAK! HE'S GETTING AWAY! AH...AH...AH...AH... AH-CHOO! [ECHOING] CHOO...CHOO...CHOO! AND NOW FOR THE BIG UNVEILING. All: AVALANCHE ANDERSON! JUST AS I SUSPECTED ALL ALONG. YEAH, LIKE, ME, TOO. BUT, UH, JUST TO COMPARE NOTES, HOW'D YOU KNOW? STUCK IN MY ROOM WATCHING HIS OLD MOVIES, I REALIZED AVALANCHE MUST HAVE CONNECTIONS IN HOLLYWOOD, SPECIFICALLY IN THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WORLD. AND HE CONTROLLED IT WITH THIS VIRTUAL REALITY HELMET AND THESE GLOVES. THAT'S WHY IT MOVED AND ACTED LIKE A REAL LIVING CREATURE. AND ALL THAT CELL PHONE INTERFERENCE? IT WAS CAUSED BY A POWERFUL REMOTE CONTROL AMPLIFIER. THAT'S WHY AVALANCHE BROADCAST FROM THE TOP OF THE SKI JUMP-- BECAUSE THE SIGNAL WAS STRONGEST THERE. BUT WE, LIKE, SAW HIM WOUNDED BY THE CREATURE, DIDN'T WE? NO. WE SAW HIM LYING IN THE SNOW. HE TOLD US HE WAS ATTACKED. AVALANCHE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY. BUT, AVALANCHE, WHY? I USED TO BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. I WANTED THAT BACK! AND THE ONLY THING STANDING IN MY WAY WAS YOU! IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU INTERLOPING ADOLESCENTS... THAT'S "MEDDLING KIDS." AND THAT GLUTTONOUS MUTT, I'D BE FAMOUS AGAIN! OH, YOU'LL BE FAMOUS, ALL RIGHT, WITH BOTH THE AUTHORITIES AND THE NATIONAL SNOWBOARDING COMMISSION. CHECK OUT THE SHREDDAGE! IT'S GONNA BE A SWEET CONTEST AFTER ALL. YOU KNOW, OFFICIALLY YOU'RE STILL ENTERED IN THE CONTEST, SHAGGY. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A RIDE? UH-UH. NO WAY! I'VE HAD ENOUGH SCARY RUNS TO LAST ME A LIFETIME. NOTHING, AND I MEAN NOTHING, COULD GET ME DOWN THAT SLOPE! [ROAR] IT'S THE SNOW CREATURE! AAH! WHOA-HO-HO-HO! WHOA! WHOA-OH! OH! WHAT'S THIS FOR? YOU WON, SHAGGY. I WON A MILLION DOLLARS? THAT'S A LOT OF CURLY FRIES! HA HA HA HA! I'M SO STOKED! LIKE, WHERE'S THE CHECK? YOU'D BETTER ASK HIM. VERY FUNNY. IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, I'M OUT OF THE BILLIONAIRE BUSINESS. WILKINSON, BACK TO WORK! OH, WELL. EASY COME... HA HA HA HA! EASY GO! RIGHT, SCOOB? REAH! SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO! CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.
