 * WHAT'S NEW, SCOOBY-DOO? * BIEN, CARRO. [GASPS] HASTA LAVISTA, NIÑO. [GASPS] [SCREECHES] AAH! AAH! [CRASH] [SCREECHES] Announcer: HOLA, RACE FANS. I'M HERRERA, COMING TO YOU FROM VIEJO NUEVO, MEXICO. WHERE WE'RE MOMENTS FROM THE START OF THE ENDURO-SLAM 5000-- A 24 HOUR, BONE RATTLING OFF ROAD RACE ACROSS TREACHEROUS DESERT. I'M HERE WITH LOCAL DIRTBIKE LEGEND ROBERTO TORRES. HOW'S YOUR COMPETITION LOOKING THIS YEAR, ROBERTO? PRETTY TOUGH, HYMIE. BUT ANYONE WHO ENTERS THE ENDURO-SLAM HAS GOTTA BE GUTSY, DETERMINED, AND ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS. [CAR BACKFIRES] [BOTH GASP] ALL SET FOR THE RACE, GANG. GOSH, I FEEL SO RUGGED. DOES THIS HELMET CLASH WITH MY JUMPER? UH, NO. A 24 HOUR OFF ROAD RACE-- THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE CRAZIEST THING WE'VE EVER DONE-- WILLINGLY. Fred: NO WORRIES, GANG. I'VE TRICKED OUT THE MYSTERY MACHINE WITH EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR OFF ROAD RACING-- HIGHBOY SUSPENSION, BIG BOY RADIALS, BAD BOY HIGH BEAMS, IT'S ALL GOOD. DON'T FORGET THE FAT BOY FRIDGE SCOOB AND I ADDED. IT'S, LIKE, TOTALLY STOCKED. HA HA. WELL, IT WAS, BEFORE THAT LONG WAIT AT THE BORDER. [LAUGHS] MMM. PAPAYA. HEY, IT'S 5 TIME ENDURO-SLAM CHAMP LUPE GESARES. YOU'RE THE MAN, LUPE. SENORITA TO YOU. OH. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CAR? I WAS TAKING A PRACTICE RUN WHEN I RAN INTO THE GIANT WORM. [LAUGHS] SOUNDED LIKE SHE SAID "GIANT WORM." THAT'S JUST RACER LINGO. RUNNING INTO A GIANT WORM IS LIKE HITTING THE WALL. RIGHT, LUPE? NO, IT'S LIKE RUNNING INTO A GIANT WORM. EL GUSANO GRANDE. UM, IF THERE'S A GIANT WORM OUT THERE, MAYBE THE RACE SHOULD BE POSTPONED. YEAH. HEH HEH. I SECOND THAT MOTION. EL GUSANO WILL NOT STOP THE RACE OR STOP LUPE GESARES FROM WINNING. [CHANTING] OFF ROAD RACERS EARTH DISGRACERS! OFF ROAD RACERS EARTH DISGRACERS!... LOOKS LIKE A MONSTER WORM ISN'T THE ONLY THING CAUSING PROBLEMS AROUND HERE. A LOT OF FOLKS THINK THESE TYPE OF RACES ARE BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. ALL THOSE GAS GUZZLERS. SO TRUE, VELMA. THAT'S WHY MY CAR'S LUNAR POWERED. GIBBY NORTON? YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER? WE MET AT SCIENCE CAMP. WE WERE LAB PARTNERS. IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA CALL IT. Fred: THAT'S AN INTERESTING RIG, FRIEND. LOOKS A LITTLE DELICATE FOR OFF ROAD SURVIVAL, THOUGH. WE'LL SEE ABOUT-- SWEET RIDE, DUDE. THANKS. RIGHT BACK AT 'CHA, FELLA. NAME'S BURT BATSON. WHAT KINDA HORSES YOU GOT? 400 BIG ONES. NO, I MEANT REAL HORSES. 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED 'EM TO PULL THAT HEAP OUT OF THE DITCH I'M GONNA DUMP IT IN. SEE YOU AT THE FINISH LINE-- NOT! [LAUGHS] FRED, ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE DRIVEN OFF ROAD BEFORE? WELL, NOT EXACTLY. BUT I GOT A HIGH SCORE IN VIDEO DIRT DEMON. FAST MOVE! I'M SUDDENLY VERY AFRAID. LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST CAR THROUGH A PLACE CALLED DIABLO GULCH WINS. DIABLO-- ISN'T THAT SPANISH FOR "DEVIL?" RELAX. WE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE GET TO DIABLO GULCH. LOOK OUT! IT'S THE MONSTER WORM! IT'S JUST AN OLD STATUE, SHAGGY. Velma: ACTUALLY, STATUES LIKE THAT ARE COMMON HERE. THEY'RE A TRIBUTE FROM ANCIENT FARMERS WHO RELIED ON WORMS TO FERTILIZE THE DESERT SOIL. HEY, I WONDER IF THAT'S WHAT LUPE GESARES RAN INTO? NO WAY TO FIND OUT NOW. I THINK THIS GUY MASTERED VIDEO DIRT DEMON EVEN BETTER THAN YOU DID, FRED. OR NOT. IF WE COULD PASS THAT MOTORCYCLE, WE'LL BE IN THE LEAD. GREAT, AND ONLY 23 HOURS LEFT OF THIS RAW ROAD RUDENESS. YEAH, ISN'T IT GREAT? HA! WE'VE GOT YOU-- NOW? WHERE'D THEY GO? UP THERE! Both: HELP! HOW'D THEY GET IN THAT TREE? [RUMBLING] All: AAH! [SCREECHES] [ALL GASP] [SCREECHING] WHO'S IN THE LEAD NOW? HA HA HA! LIKE, THE GIANT WORM IS REAL. IT'S A DIFFERENT RACE NOW, GANG. THERE'S A MYSTERY WRIGGLING AROUND. GOOD THING THE WORM ONLY POPPED A TIRE. HEY, WHERE'S THE JACK? OH, I HAD TO TAKE OUT THAT TO MAKE ROOM FOR A FEW EXTRA OFF ROAD MODIFICATIONS. LIKE WHAT? HYDROLIC LIFTERS, EJECTOR SEAT, EMERGENCY FLOTATION DEVICE. WHY WOULD WE NEED A FLOTATION DEVICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT? WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A FLASH FLOOD MIGHT HIT. BESIDES, WHO NEEDS A JACK WHEN YOU'VE GOT A FIRST RATE PIT CREW? HUH? HUH? [BOTH GRUNTING] NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CALL IT A "PIT CREW." HA HA HA. LIKE, IT'S THE PITS. THERE. ALL DONE. [BOTH PANT, GASP] LIKE, IT'S THE WORM! Both: OW! OW! OW! OOH! OW! OW! OW! GUYS, IT'S JUST A SHADOW FROM SCOOBY'S TAIL. HA HA HA! OW! HEY, GOOD ONE, SCOOB. OW! JUST ONE MORE, SCOOB. OW! SHEESH. Both: AAH! AAH! AAH! OW! OW! OW! AAH! YEE-HAW! WHOA! JINKIES! IT'S CUTTING RIGHT ACROSS THE RACE COURSE. I CAN MAKE IT. I CAN MAKE IT. I WAS WRONG! All: PHEW! THAT WAS CLOSE. [CREAKS] EVERYONE SLIDE FORWARD. NO, NO, THE OTHER FORWARD! LIKE, LOOKS LIKE THE RACE IS OVER-- [WHIMPERS] FOR US. All: AAH! WOW, THAT THING TOOK OFF LIKE A JET. UNFORTUNATELY CATCHING US IN ITS TAIL WIND! WOW, YOUR FLOTATION DEVICE ACTUALLY CAME IN HANDY. PONTOONS--DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT 'EM. LOOK, IT'S ROBERTO TORRES' MOTORCYCLE. BUT WHERE IS HE? LIKE, MAYBE THE GIANT WORM GOT HIM. [ALL WHIMPERING] Fred: HEY, THE PROTESTERS WE SAW AT THE START OF THE RACE. WHAT ARE THEY DOING DOWN HERE? WHAT ARE WE DOING DOWN HERE? AND EXACTLY WHERE IS HERE? WHY, WORMTOPIA, OF COURSE, THE ANCIENT HOME OF THE GREAT WORM GUSANO GRANDE. EL GUSANO. EL GUSANO. WELL, WE'RE SORRY FOR THE INTRUSION. BUT WE REALLY DO NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE. [CHUCKLES] WE'LL BE HAPPY TO SHOW YOU THE WAY OUT AFTER THE GREAT WORMIAN FEAST. THERE'S A FEAST? YES, AND YOU'RE THE GUESTS OF HONOR. OH, GREAT WORM, ACCEPT THIS OFFERING OF EVILDOERS WHO DARE TO DESICRATE YOUR SACRED SHRINE WITH THEIR NASTY OFF ROAD VEHICLES. LIKE, THIS IS AN HONOR? NEVER TRUST ANYONE WEARING A WORM SUIT. [SCREECH] [GASPS] IT IS THE GREAT ONE. GUSANO LIVES! All: LONG LIVE THE WORM. LONG LIVE GUSANO GRANDE! LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WORM FOOD. THERE'S A TUNNEL OUT OF HERE. BUT WE'LL NEVER GET PAST THESE WORM DUDES. UNLESS WE CAN DISTRACT THEM SOMEHOW. HEH. TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE AN EARLY BIRD TO GET THE WORM. HEY, LIKE, WHO SAYS WE DON'T? [WHISPERS] Scooby: CAW! CAW! All: AAH! WHAT? Scooby: CAW! CAW! OH, HA HA. HOW DO YOU DO THAT, SCOOB? [MAN SINGING IN SPANISH] [SCREECHES] Both: WHOA! [SCREECHES] LOOKS LIKE WE'RE STILL IN THE RACE. GRACIAS, AMIGOS. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. [ALL SCREAM] OH! HEY, WATCH IT. YOU SCRATCHED MY CAR. THE HALFWAY POINT OF THE RACE. WE'D BETTER FILL UP. YOU HEARD THE MAN, SCOOB. 2 BOWLS OF BEANS, PLEASE. REAH. THOSE CREEPY WORM WORSHIPPERS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES TRYING TO GET RID OF THE COMPETITION. I'M SURPRISED YOU MADE IT THIS FAR. YOU'RE TOUGHER THAN YOU LOOK. WELL, NOT TO BOAST, BUT I CAN BENCH 220. GIBBY? YOU MADE IT ACROSS THAT FISSURE? PIECE OF CAKE, EXCEPT I SPRUNG A RADIATOR LEAK IN THE PROCESS. THAT'S A TOUGH BREAK, BUDDY. YOU'LL NEVER GET A NEW RADIATOR OUT HERE. DON'T NEED ONE. MY CAR HAS AN ENGINE IN THE FRONT AND ONE IN THE REAR. IT'S DESIGNED TO BE DRIVEN FROM EITHER END. WOW, PRETTY COOL. YOU TALKIN' ABOUT THE CAR OR ME? GOSH, WE WERE REALLY LOW ON FUEL. COME ON, GUYS. WE'RE ALL GASSED UP. YEAH, SO ARE... DON'T EVEN. Fred: WE'RE OUT OF GAS. SOMEONE SABOTAGED OUR FUEL TANK. WE'D BETTER GET BACK TO THE GAS STATION. [SCREECHES] Shaggy: OR NOT. WHOA! AAH! [ALL WHIMPER] ZOINKS! LIKE, HOW ARE WE GONNA WORM OUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE? QUICK, POP THE HOOD. BATTERY, WATER... BOBBY PIN. [ENGINE STARTS] VOILA. WOW, DAPHNE, A HYDRO ELECTRIC FUEL SOURCE FROM THINGS FOUND IN YOUR PURSE. NO BIGGIE. HEY, DID YOU GUYS SEE HOW THE WORM WENT AROUND THE ROCK? HMM. HUH? AH. [TIRES SCREECH] WE'RE SAFE UP HERE. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT CAN BURROW THROUGH SOLID ROCK. LOOK-- DIABLO GULCH. Fred: THE FINISH LINE IS THROUGH THAT NARROW CANYON. BE MY GUEST, HEH, HEH, HEH. THAT WORM'S GONNA WASTE HIM. WE'D BETTER ROLL. [TIRES SCREECH] HEY! WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU, PAL! NAH-UH. YOU'RE JUST TRYIN' TO GET TO DIABLO GULCH FIRST. DAPHNE, TAKE THE WHEEL. CAREFUL, FREDDY. LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO MY RIDE! [SCREECHING] YEE-HAW! LIKE, PLEASE--DON'T SAY WE'RE GOIN' AFTER THAT GUY. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO FOR HIM. BUT WE CAN STOP THAT WORM BEFORE IT HURTS ANY OTHER RACERS. [WHIMPERS] OKAY, HERE'S THE PLAN: THE ENGINE SOUND SHOULD ATTRACT THE WORM. NOW WHEN IT COMES OUT, YOU GUYS LEAD IT INTO THE GULCH. YOU READY? Both: UH-UH. WHAT'S THAT? CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE ENGINE NOISE. [TIRES SQUEAL] Both: AAH! Both: AAH! [SCREECHES] Both: AAH! HEY, FRED'S PLAN ACTUALLY WORKED. [SCREECHES] ZOINKS! WHO CUT THE NET? All: LONG LIVE GUSANO! THE WORMIANS, OF COURSE. [SCREECHING] FRED, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [TIRES SQUEAL] [HISSES] All: HAIL THE WORM. [TIRES SQUEAL] NO! FREDDY! All: AAH! Both: AAH! AAH! [BOTH GRUNT] JEEPERS! WHERE'D HE GO? I DON'T REMEMBER A SUNROOF. IT'S PART OF THE EJECTOR SEAT SYSTEM I INSTALLED. PRETTY STYLIN', HUH? HELP! HELP! Velma: COME ON OUT... GIBBY. All: GIBBY NORTON? LIKE, HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HIM, VELMA? I FIGURED THE WORM HAD TO BE A RACER. BECAUSE IT ALWAYS WENT AFTER THE LEADER. IT WANTED TO WIN. MY FIRST CLUE WAS THIS PIECE OF WORM TOOTH. IT'S BLACK GLASS LIKE THE LUNAR PANELS ON GIBBY'S CAR. THEN THE WORM OOZED GREEN STUFF JUST LIKE THE FLUID FROM HIS RADIATOR. I DIDN'T WANNA HURT ANYONE. I JUST WANTED TO IMPRESS VELMA WITH MY SUPER COOL WORM MOBILE. YOU MEAN, YOU DID IT FOR ME? YEP, AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT, IF NOT FOR YOU MEDDLING OFF THE ROAD RACERS. SO WHO WON THE RACE? ACTUALLY, NO ONE DID. WITH THE GULCH BLOCKED, YOU'D HAVE TO GO ON FOOT. RUN FOR IT! [ALL LAUGH, CHATTER] JINKIES! SCOOBY WON! [CHEERS] SCOOBY-OOBY-OOBY-OOBY SCOOBY DOO!
