 * WHAT'S NEW, SCOOBY-DOO? * HUH? WHO--WHO'S THERE? YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH, AKIRA ONODERA. THE NEW WHARF YOU WANT TO BUILD FOR YOUR FACTORY IS A THREAT TO OUR SIMPLE WAY OF LIFE. THINGS IN THIS VILLAGE HAVE NOT CHANGED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. YOU CANNOT HOLD BACK PROGRESS, ANCIENT ONE. SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, THIS VILLAGE HAS HAD ITS OWN FORM OF PROTECTION. THAT'S NOTHING BUT AN OLD LEGEND. WE SHALL SEE WHAT IS LEGEND AND WHAT IS REAL WHEN YOUR ACCURSED FACTORY LIES IN RUBBLE AROUND YOU, CRUSHED BY THE FEET OF A GIANT MONSTER! HA HA HA HA! Professor: HERE TO UNVEIL HER INVENTION, THIS YEAR'S UNANIMOUS AGE-APPROPRIATE SCIENCE SUPERSTAR, MY VERY OWN PRIZE PUPIL, VELMA DINKLEY. NO WAY. NOT AGAIN. THAT'S NOT FAIR. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, ELLIOT. THANK YOU, PROFESSOR POMFRIT. IT'S A THRILL TO FINALLY UNVEIL DOGBOT, THE WORLD'S FIRST FULLY FUNCTIONAL ROBOTIC CANINE. A DOG? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I HATE DOGS. I'M ALLERGIC. BUT, LIKE, WE ALREADY HAVE A DOG. REAH. UNLIKE SOME DOGS, DOGBOT IS INCAPABLE OF FEAR, AND NOT ONLY DOES DOGBOT NOT REQUIRE FOOD OR SLEEP... HE CAN PROVIDE IT. MAYBE THAT TIN-PLATED TERRIER ISN'T ALL BAD AFTER ALL, HUH, SCOOB? HMPH! Professor Pomfrit: AND AS THE GRAND PRIZE WINNER, WE'RE TAKING YOU AND 4 OF YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS TO PRESENT DOGBOT TO THE FAMOUS ROBOTICS EXPERT, DR. AKIRA ONODERA IN TOKYO, JAPAN. OHH... Professor Pomfrit: THERE'S MOUNT FUJI, AND THE OSAKUSA TEMPLE AND THE OLD TAKAMOTO MOVIE STUDIO. [YAWNS] PROFESSOR, YOU KNOW JAPAN LIKE I KNOW THE LAYOUT OF MY REFRIGERATOR. I SHOULD, SHAGGY. DR. ONODERA AND I STUDIED TOGETHER YEARS AGO AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO. SHAGGY? SHAGGY? JET LAG. I'M AFRAID SHAGGY DOESN'T TRAVEL TOO WELL. [SNORES] VELMA, YOU ARE INDEED A ROLE MODEL FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF AUTOMATION ENGINEERS. THANK YOU, DR. ONODERA, BUT DOGBOT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO YOUR ROBOTIC MARVELS. Ancient One: DISHONOR OUR VILLAGE BY BUILDING THAT WHARF, AND THESE METAL MONSTROSITIES WILL LIE CRUSHED UNDER YOUR FEET. YOU CHOSE TO IGNORE MY WARNING, ONODERA. NOW, SUFFER THE ANCIENT CURSE! I SEE NO GIANT MONSTERS, ANCIENT ONE. TRUE, FOR IT IS YOU YOURSELF WHO WILL BECOME THE MONSTER. EACH NIGHT, WHEN YOU FALL ASLEEP, YOU WILL TRANSFORM INTO A GIANT CREATURE AND DESTROY YOUR OWN HATEFUL CREATIONS! DOGBOT, EXTRA LARGE TERIYAKI PIZZA, NOW! WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT, AKIRA? JUST SOME OLD MYSTIC FROM THE VILLAGE TRYING TO SCARE ME WITH A PHONY CURSE. HE THINKS I'M DISHONORING HIS TOWN BY BUILDING A WHARF. WELL, THANKS TO VELMA, THE ONLY THING HE CURSED WAS THAT PIZZA. MMM. [GULPS] SHAGGY ATE THE CURSED PIZZA! CURSED?! [GULPS] DON'T WORRY, SHAGGY-SAN. HE IS ONLY A CRAZY OLD MAN. THE PROBABILITY OF YOUR TURNING INTO A MONSTER WHILE YOU SLEEP IS SLIM. Akira: YOU ARE ALL MOST WELCOME AT MY GUEST HOUSE. I HOPE YOU WILL SLEEP WELL. HUH? THIS? THIS IS ONE SERIOUS CHAIN, SCOOBY-DOO. I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE, EVEN IF I DO CHANGE INTO A MONSTER, WHICH I WON'T 'CAUSE I'M NOT FALLING ASLEEP. [YAWNS] I DON'T CARE HOW JET LAGGED... [SNORES] RAGGY? OHH... NIGHT, NIGHT. [ROARING] ZOINKS! AAH! AAH! AAH! [ROARING] ZOINKS! ZOINKS! [SCOOBY AND SHAGGY SNORE] Velma: GOOD MORNING, SLEEPY HEADS. YOU WERE SO TIRED FROM JET LAG LAST NIGHT, WE HAD DOGBOT RUSTLE YOU UP SOME BREAKFAST IN BED. REAH! [YAWNS] THANKS, BUT I'M REALLY NOT THAT HUNGRY. HUH? HUH? HUH? LIKE, DID I JUST SAY THAT? LET US HOPE, SHAGGY-SAN, THAT YOUR HUNGER WAS NOT SATISFIED LAST NIGHT... BY DEVOURING THE VILLAGE. THE VILLAGE? VILLAGE? THE VILLAGE? MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES FOR THE INTRUSION. I AM LIEUTENANT KEIKO TANAKA OF THE TOKYO POLICE. A 30-FOOT MONSTER ATTACKED BOTH THE VILLAGE AND THE FACTORY LAST NIGHT. LIEUTENANT TANAKA, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK IT WAS SHAGGY. IT DEFIES ALL LOGIC. YEAH, LIKE, I WAS HERE IN BED ALL NIGHT, AND I CHAINED MYSELF UP FOR GOOD MEASURE. [ALL GASP] LOOKS LIKE THIS CHAIN HAS BEEN BITTEN THROUGH BY RAZOR SHARP TEETH. ZOINKS! I AM A MONSTER! GANG, I THINK WE'VE GOT ANOTHER MYSTERY ON OUR HANDS. WELL, AT LEAST SHAGGY'S MONSTROUS APPETITE HAS RETURNED. SHAGGY'S NO MONSTER. THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR ALL OF THIS. WHAT'S THE LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THAT? Shaggy: ZOINKS! HA! THAT IS THE SOUND OF THE MONSTER. THE ANCIENT ONE PUT HIS CURSE ON YOU! YOU DESTROYED OUR VILLAGE! UH-OH. SHAGGY-SAN, A TOURIST JUST TURNED IN AN AMATEUR VIDEO OF THE MONSTER AND...WELL... IN LIGHT OF NEW EVIDENCE, I'M AFRAID I MUST TAKE YOU INTO CUSTODY. UH-OH. COME ON, EVERYBODY. HOLD TIGHT. Velma: JINKIES! LIKE, THANKS AGAIN, DOGBOT. YOU ARE ONE HANDY HEAVY METAL POOCH! WOW! THIS IS WHAT I CALL RAPID TRANSIT. THIS IS THE BULLET TRAIN, FREDDY, AND JUDGING FROM MY HAIR, I'D SAY WE'RE GOING 210 MILES AN HOUR! WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY INSIDE! SO, LIKE, JUST TO REVIEW, I'M TURNING INTO A MONSTER EVERY NIGHT, AND WE'RE, LIKE, ON THE RUN FROM THE AUTHORITIES. THAT'S BAD. BUT WE DID MANAGE TO FIND THE DINING CAR. THAT'S GOOD! WE'LL KEEP YOU OUT OF SIGHT UNTIL WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS MYSTERY. DON'T LOOK NOW, BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE TO KEEP US OUT OF SIGHT. Velma: IT'S LIEUTENANT TANAKA! GOTCHA! WHO-OA-OA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! NICE GOING, DOGBOT. YOU REALLY ARE MAN'S BEST FRIEND. AND GIRL'S, TOO. [JEALOUS GROWL] WELL, THAT DETECTIVE LADY IS LIKE MAN'S WORST FRIEND. SHE'S NOT GONNA GIVE UP UNTIL SHE NABS US. DON'T WORRY, SHAGGY. NOW THAT WE'RE IN DOWNTOWN TOKYO SURROUNDED BY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, WE'LL JUST MELD INTO THE SCENERY. 4 AMERICAN TOURISTS, A GREAT DANE, AND A ROBOT-- SURE, FRED, WE'LL BLEND RIGHT IN. Shaggy: YEAH, WE STAND OUT LIKE A SORE SUSHI ROLL. LIKE, COULD THINGS GET ANY WORSE? YOU SHOULD NEVER ASK THAT, SHAGGY. THINGS CAN ALWAYS GET WORSE. HELLO, VELMA DINKLEY. ELLIOT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN JAPAN? I MADE MY FOLKS TAKE ME HERE AS A CONSOLATION PRIZE FOR HAVING MY AWARD STOLEN FROM ME BY YOU! VELMA'S NO THIEF, ELLIOT. MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. BUT HE'S DEFINITELY A MONSTER. HEY, POLICE, OVER HERE! [WHISTLES] WE'RE TOO EASY TO SPOT. NOT FOR LONG. QUICK, INTO THAT ALLEY! [WHISTLES BLOW] ARE YOU BLIND? THAT'S THEM RIGHT THERE. THERE THEY ARE. GET THEM! SO, YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE ME? WHAT DO YOU SAY NOW? LIKE, SAYONARA! [POP SONG IN JAPANESE PLAYING] THAT TANAKA DOESN'T GIVE UP. WE'VE GOT TO GET OFF THE STREET BEFORE SHE FINDS US AGAIN. HEY, LIKE, CHECK OUT THAT CRAZY HOTEL. LET'S CHECK INTO THAT CRAZY HOTEL. WE NEED A PLACE TO CRASH. OKAY, WE'RE ALL SIGNED IN. MR. SMITH, MS. VON SMITH, MS. SMYTHE, AND ME, MR. SHECKELMAN. UH, LIKE, NO OFFENSE, FRED, BUT I THINK I'D BETTER SLEEP IN THERE. YOU KNOW HOW RESTLESS I GET IN MY SLEEP. UH, YOU WANT TO SLEEP IN THE HOTEL VAULT, MR. SHECKELMAN? THAT IS HIGHLY UNORTHODOX. I'M SHECKELMAN, HE'S SMITH. THAT WOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE, WOULD IT? MY FRIEND JUST WANTS TO FEEL SAFE. WHEW! IF THESE ROOMS WERE ANY SMALLER THEY'D BE DRAWERS. IT'S A TOKYO TUBE HOTEL, FREDDY, WHERE THE ECONOMICAL MEETS THE CRAMPED. SORRY, SCOOBY, IT'S TOO CROWDED IN HERE FOR THE BOTH OF US. YOU CAN STAND GUARD OUT THERE. [WHIMPERING] DON'T WORRY, SCOOB. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN IN A SAFE, MODERN CITY LIKE TOKYO? [CRASH] JINKIES! LOOK! [LOUD FOOTSTEPS] JEEPERS! UH, GUYS? DON'T LOOK NOW, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SHAGGY REALLY IS THE MONSTER! NO! WOW! THAT WAS TOO CLOSE. QUICK, HE'S MAKING A RUN FOR IT. WE'VE GOTTA FOLLOW HIM. SHAGGY SURE WALKS A LOT FASTER WITH 20-FOOT LEGS. BUT HOPEFULLY NOT FOR MUCH LONGER. THE SUN'S COMING UP. HE SHOULD RESUME HIS HUMAN FORM. [SNORING] JUST 5 MORE MINUTES. Velma: SHAGGY, WAKE UP. BREAKFAST! HA HA HA! SO I GUESS YOU WERE KIDDING ABOUT BREAKFAST, HUH? HEY, I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE STILL HUNGRY. WE WATCHED YOU DEVOUR HALF OF TOKYO LAST NIGHT. HERE, SHAGGY. GOOD THING I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF PACKING EMERGENCY OUTFITS. I GUESS THIS IS IT-- TIME TO TURN ME IN. OH, NO. NOT A CHANCE. NO. LIKE, FACE IT. WE'RE FAR FROM HOME, I'M TURNING INTO A MONSTER EVERY NIGHT, AND WE DON'T HAVE A FRIEND TO TURN TO. THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE. THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO CAN HELP US. [CELL PHONE RINGS] HMM? VELMA, THANK GOODNESS. YES, OF COURSE I'LL HELP, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL. I'LL MEET YOU THIS AFTERNOON. KAMINARI GATE AT OSAKUSA TEMPLE. IT'S SECLUDED AND EASY TO FIND. LIEUTENANT TANAKA WILL NEVER THINK OF LOOKING FOR YOU THERE. Fred: I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU, DAPH, ONLY YOU COULD CREATE THESE GREAT DISGUISES WITH JUST A STAPLER AND BLACK MASCARA. AH, THERE IT IS! OSAKUSA TEMPLE. HMMPH! HEY, THERE'S PROFESSOR POMFRIT. LET'S GO MAKE CONTACT. BUT GANG, PLAY IT REAL COOL. EXCUSE ME... PROFESSOR POMFRIT? YES? IT'S US! FRED, DAPHNE, VELMA, SHAGGY, AND SCOOBY. WE'RE IN DISGUISE. Tanaka: YOU CALL THAT A DISGUISE? ALL I HAD WAS MASCARA AND A STAPLER. IT'S A TRAP! GET OUT OF HERE, KIDS! DOGBOT, SUPER JUMBO POPCORN, STAT! TAKE COVER! THIS IS POPCORN! AFTER THEM! HURRY! RUH-OH! DOGBOT, CAN YOU TURN INTO SOMETHING THAT'LL GET US OUT OF HERE? YIKES! UGH. LIKE, SO SLEEPY. MUSTN'T SLEEP. TURN INTO MONSTER. [SNORING] HUH? HEY, CHECK OUT THIS TINY LITTLE CAR. ZOINKS! OH, NO! LIKE, I'M A BIG GIANT MONSTER! [WHIMPERS] I'M ALL ALONE! I'M ALL ALONE! WHAT A BUMMER, RIGHT, SCOOB? REAH. BUMMER. [BOTH CRYING] OH, NO! SCOOBY-DOO! THE ANCIENT ONE'S CURSE GOT YOU, TOO! Velma: NOT QUITE. HUH? YOU'RE ALL GIANTS! OH, MAN, HOW ARE WE ALL GONNA FIT INTO THE MYSTERY MACHINE? DON'T WORRY, SHAG. WE'RE NOT BIG. TOKYO'S JUST LITTLE. Velma: SEE? WE'RE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A DETAILED MODEL OF TOKYO. WE FOLLOWED DOGBOT TO THIS ABANDONED MOVIE STUDIO. THEY USED TO MAKE MOVIES ABOUT GIANT MONSTERS HERE. THIS PROVES YOU'RE NOT THE MONSTER AT ALL. LIKE, IF NOT ME, WHO OR WHAT'S BEEN RUNNING AROUND IN SIZE 900 SNEAKERS? SOMETHING TELLS ME WE'LL HAVE OUR ANSWER WHEN WE FIND OUT WHO ORDERED DOGBOT TO BRING YOU HERE. AND THE BEST PLACE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT MYSTERY IS RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED-- AT THE ROBOTICS FACTORY. NOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS SEARCH THIS PLACE FOR-- LOOK! THERE'S ELLIOT KISSING UP TO DR. ONODERA. WHY, THAT CHICKEN. MAYBE ELLIOT KNOWS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MONSTER. WE BETTER ASK HIM. OR BETTER YET, ME! UH--UH, HIM! [ROARS] ZOINKS! [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] NOW LET'S SEE WHO'S REALLY BEHIND THE ATTACK OF THE 30-FOOT SHAGGY. All: PROFESSOR POMFRIT! I HATED TO ADMIT IT, BUT I KNEW IT MUST BE THE PROFESSOR. THE MONSTER DIDN'T SHOW UP UNTIL WE DID. HE SAW THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ANCIENT ONE AND ONODERA AND USED THE GIANT MONSTER LEGEND TO FRAME SHAGGY. WHEN SHAGGY ATE THE CURSED PIZZA, POMFRIT RIGGED DOGBOT TO RESPOND TO HIS REMOTE COMMANDS... AND GET THE SLEEPING SHAGGY AWAY FROM THE ACTION SO WE THOUGHT HE WAS THE MONSTER. BUT, LIKE, WHY? BECAUSE EVERYTHING HE HAD SHOULD BE MINE. WHY'S HE RICH WHEN I'M JUST AN UNDERPAID HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER? SOMEBODY'S FAVORITE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. [SIGHS] YOU'RE A BRILLIANT GIRL, VELMA. YOU WERE MY PRIZE STUDENT, AND I USED YOUR INGENIOUS INVENTION FOR MY OWN SELFISH ENDS. I'M VERY SORRY. HE WOULD'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT, TOO, IF IT WEREN'T FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS. BUT, WHAT OF THE ANCIENT ONE? SURELY HE HAD A HAND IN ALL OF THIS. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS THE ANCIENT ONE. YOU MEAN HE WAS... [GULP] A SPIRIT? WHATEVER HE WAS, I'M SURE HE'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I'VE DECIDED TO BUILD A NEW WHARF SOMEWHERE ELSE. AFTER ALL THIS, I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYTHING DESTROYED. HERE, ELLIOT, A DOG YOU WON'T BE ALLERGIC TO. WHAT? YOU'RE GIVING HIM TO ME? MY OWN DOG! WOW! I--HEH. THANKS, VELMA. THAT WAS REALLY SWEET OF YOU, VELMA. BUT AREN'T YOU GOING TO MISS DOGBOT? NO. I MAY HAVE GIVEN DOGBOT A SUPERSIZED BRAIN, BUT THAT JUST CAN'T COMPETE WITH SCOOBY-DOO'S SUPERSIZED HEART. All: AWW! SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO!
