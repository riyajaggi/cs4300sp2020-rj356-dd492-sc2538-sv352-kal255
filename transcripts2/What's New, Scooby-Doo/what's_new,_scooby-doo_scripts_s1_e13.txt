 I'M WARNING YOU! TRY TO BREAK MY RECORD, AND EVERYONE SHALL SUFFER! HUH? WHAT A GREAT NAME FOR A BALL FIELD! YEAH, COOKIE! [SLURPS] I THOUGHT IT USED TO BE CALLED POTTER STADIUM. IT WAS, BEFORE POTTER STADIUM'S 100-YEAR-OLD FOUNDATION GAVE OUT AND IT SUNK INTO THE GROUND. IN FACT, COOKIE COMPANY INTERNATIONAL PARK WAS BUILT RIGHT ON TOP OF THE OLD STADIUM. I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY GET TO MEET LUIS SANTIAGO! YEAH, ME, TOO, FRED! HA HA. LIKE, WHO IS HE? HE'S ONLY THE BEST LONG BALL HITTER IN BASEBALL TODAY. HE'S ONE HOME RUN AWAY FROM BREAKING THE ALL-TIME RECORD! RIZZLY BEAR! RUFF RUFF RUFF RUFF! NO, SCOOBY! THAT'S JUST MR. GRIZZ, THE TEAM MASCOT! RRR, RRR, RRR! HEY, LET GO, YA MUTT! HA HA HA! LIKE, USUALLY IT TAKES A LOT LONGER BEFORE WE'RE UNMASKING PEOPLE. HEE HEE HEE! SORRY. HEY, AREN'T YOU J.T. PAGE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE A PITCHER ON THIS TEAM. YEAH, I WAS, BUT THEN I GOT CUT. I REMEMBER THAT. DIDN'T YOU THROW A BURRITO AT SOMEONE IN THE STANDS? NOT EXACTLY MY FINEST HOUR. THEY TOLD ME THE ONLY WAY I COULD STAY WITH THE CLUB IS IF I BECAME THE NEW MASCOT, MR. GRIZZ. COOL! MY NAME IS FRED JONES. I WON THE "MEET LUIS SANTIAGO" CONTEST. SO...WE'RE HERE TO MEET LUIS SANTIAGO. YEAH. HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE. WELL, LUIS, IT'S BEEN A TOUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR YA. ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW TO BREAK OUT OF THIS DROUGHT YOU'RE IN? UM...WELL, BOB, YOU USED TO PLAY. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. IT'S JUST A LITTLE SLUMP. I'LL COME OUT OF IT, I'M SURE. EXCUSE ME, LUIS. I'M FRED JONES, THE CONTEST WINNER. WELL, FRED, I SEE YOU BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS WITH YOU. UH-HUH. THIS IS VELMA, DAPHNE, AND SHAGGY. AND SCOOBY-DOO! NICE TO MEET YOU ALL. SO REMEMBER THAT GAME AGAINST SAN JOSE WHERE YOU WENT 5 FOR 8 IN EXTRA INNINGS AND WON THE GAME WITH A WALK-OFF HOME RUN? YEAH... THAT WAS SO COOL! AND REMEMBER THE TIME THAT YOU WERE DOWN 3 RUNS TO PORTLAND IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH? Umpire: STRIKE 2! Announcer: STRIKE 3! AND THAT'S ALL FOR THE GRIZZLIES IN THE SECOND. HERE YOU GO, SHAGGY. SHE GAVE YOU ALL THAT STUFF FOR FREE, SHAGGY? UH-HUH. WHY? LIKE, BEATS ME. SHE EVEN SAID SHE'D STOP BY EVERY INNING JUST TO SEE HOW I WAS DOING! HA HA HA! THAT IS ONE DEDICATED PEANUT-SOFT-SERVE- ICE-CREAM-PIZZA GIRL. OH, NO! IT'S STARTING TO RAIN! DON'T WORRY, DAPHNE. YOUR HAIR WON'T GET WET. COOKIE COMPANY INTERNATIONAL PARK HAS A RETRACTABLE ROOF. ACTUALLY, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT A RAINOUT. THE GRIZZLIES WOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP THE GAME WITH A DOUBLEHEADER. WE'RE 1 AND 17 IN THOSE. AND I DID JUST GET MY HAIR DONE. Announcer: OK, GRIZZ FANS, STEVE POWELL HERE TO CALL THE BOTTOM OF THE SECOND. THE FIRST PITCH TO LUIS SANTIAGO IS JUST ON THE OUTSIDE CORNER FOR A STRIKE. I WARNED YOU! NOW EVERYONE WILL SUFFER! AAAHHH! AAH! AAH! RRAAH! HEE HEE HA! AND SO HE TOLD ME THAT IF I TRIED TO BREAK THE RECORD, HE'D MAKE BAD THINGS HAPPEN HERE AT THE PARK. THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN PRETENDING TO BE IN A SLUMP. ANY IDEA WHO THIS BASEBALL BOGEYMAN MIGHT BE? OF COURSE! HE'S THE GHOST OF THE ALL-TIME HOME RUN LEADER CAB CRAIG. G-G-GHOST? GHOST?! LUIS, HONEY, THAT WAS GREAT. WELL, NOT GREAT GREAT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WE'RE NOT ONLY THE LEAD STORY ON SPORTS STATION, BUT THE EVENING NEWS, TOO. THIS IS MY PUBLICIST, AUTUMN SUMMERFIELD. HI THERE. I'M FRED, AND THIS IS DAPH-- YEAH, YEAH, WONDERFUL FOR YOU. LOOK, LUIS, WE NEED TO MOVE ON THIS WHILE THE STORY IS HOT. NO PUN INTENDED. HA HA! MAYBE LUIS SHOULD REST UP BEFORE THE BIG GAME. UM...WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKING FOR THE NAMETAG THAT SAYS "LUIS' TRAINER." AND I DON'T SEE IT, SO BUZZ OFF. AUTUMN, GIVE IT A REST. DAPHNE'S RIGHT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT IN THE MORNING. DON'T WORRY, LUIS. YOU CONCENTRATE ON BASEBALL AND LEAVE THE CRIME SOLVING TO US. WE'RE GONNA BRING THAT PHONY PHANTOM TO JUSTICE! AND THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THOSE EXPLODING LIGHTS. MAKE SURE TO STAY ATTACHED TO THESE SAFETY LINES. IT SURE IS A LONG WAY DOWN TO THE FIELD. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. A GENERATOR THAT SMALL COULDN'T RUN ALL THESE LIGHTS. NO, BUT IF THE LIGHTS WERE ALREADY RUNNING, IT COULD OVERLOAD THEM. CAUSING THEM TO EXPLODE! YOU KNOW WHAT MY FAVORITE KIND OF FOOD IS, SCOOB, OLD BUDDY, OLD FRIEND, OLD PAL? UH-UH. STADIUM FOOD! [DIGGING] BURYING LEFTOVERS FOR LATER? UH-HUH. GOOD IDEA. HERE, I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND. [CLANG] HEY, I WONDER WHERE THIS GOES. Shaggy: WHOA, LIKE... WHERE ARE WE? I DUNNO. REMEMBER WHAT VELMA SAID ABOUT THE OLD POTTER STADIUM SINKING INTO THE GROUND? HOO HOO HOO! WELL, I THINK WE'RE SUNK, TOO! AND THIS MUST BE HOW THE BASEBALL SPECTER GETS AROUND! ALL THESE TUNNELS ARE RIGHT UNDER THE NEW FIELD. [GHOST LAUGHING] HAAAAAAHHH! YIKES! UHH! AAH! AAH! THAT SPOOKY SPECTER WON'T THINK TO LOOK IN HERE. HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH! WHY DO I GET THE FEELING HE'S NOT TRYING TO GIVE US A NICE, RELAXING STEAM BATH? [WHIMPERING] HEEEELP! Shaggy: SOMEBODY GET US OUTTA HERE! [SOBBING] IT'S SHAGGY AND SCOOBY! OH, NO, IT'S JAMMED! STAND BACK! [SHAGGY GIGGLING] LIKE, THANKS. ONE MORE MINUTE, AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF SLOW-ROASTED PEANUTS. HEY, GANG, WHAT'S THAT UP THERE? Shaggy: LIKE, MAYBE THE CLEANING CREW LEFT A LIGHT ON? OR MAYBE IT'S THE BASEBALL SPECTER! WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY I'M RIGHT AND LEAVE IT AT THAT? GUYS? GUYS! Velma: THIS IS WHERE BOB TAYLOR DOES THE RADIO BROADCAST FOR THE GAMES. THAT'S RIGHT! HE USED TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER. SURE. HERE'S HIS TRADING CARD. OH, AND IT'S STILL GOT GUM! "PLAYED 7 SEASONS, THREW LEFTY, AND HAD A .102 BATTING AVERAGE." IS THAT GOOD? IF YOU'RE PLAYING T-BALL. ACTUALLY, COME TO THINK OF IT, BOB TAYLOR WAS ON THE SAME TEAM WITH CAB CRAIG. REALLY? [ORGAN PLAYS] OH, IT'S THAT AWFUL ORGAN MUSIC! COME ON, GANG. I'VE GOT A PLAN. FOLLOW ME. [ORGAN PLAYING] HOO HOO HAH HAH HAH! OK, FRED, SO, LIKE, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? Freddy: TO COME IN HERE AND SEE WHO'S PLAYING THAT ORGAN. AND THEN? DIDN'T THINK IT OUT PAST THAT. WELL, I'VE GOT AN IDEA--RUN! * WELL, YOU CAN PLAY MY GAME * * IF YOU JUST TELL ME YOUR NAME * * WELL, YOU CAN PLAY MY GAME * * BUT I'LL PUT YOU TO SHAME * * I ALMOST BROKE MY HIGHEST SCORE * * THEN YOU WALKED THROUGH THAT DOOR * * I LOST MY GAME, AND YOU'RE TO BLAME * * I COULDA BEEN IN THE HALL OF FAME * * WELL, YOU CAN PLAY MY GAME * * IF YOU JUST TELL ME YOUR NAME * * WELL, YOU CAN PLAY MY GAME * * BUT I'LL PUT YOU TO SHAME * * WELL, YOU CAN PLAY MY GAME * * IF YOU JUST TELL ME YOUR NAME * * WELL, YOU CAN PLAY MY GAME * * BUT I'LL PUT YOU TO SHAME * [SHAGGY WHIMPERING] Daphne: THAT SURE WAS CLOSE. I--I'VE HEARD OF TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME BUT NEVER TAKE ME OUT AT THE BALL GAME. HOO HOO HOO! GOTCHA! YOU AREN'T THE BASEBALL SPECTER! AUTUMN SUMMERFIELD. WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO GET A PICTURE OF THE BASEBALL SPECTER? I WAS DRIVING HOME WHEN IT DAWNED ON ME-- LUIS' PICTURE PLUS THAT CREEPY CATCHER'S PICTURE EQUALS GREAT PUBLICITY. NOW, WHY DON'T YOU KIDS DO ME A FAVOR AND STOP GETTING IN MY WAY? SHE SURE IS GROUCHY! AND SHE SURE IS LYING. WHAT? HOW DO YOU KNOW? BECAUSE, LISTEN TO THAT STORM OUTSIDE. SHE SAID SHE WAS DRIVING HOME WHEN THE IDEA HIT HER. BUT DID YOU NOTICE HER SUEDE SHOES? THEY WERE PERFECTLY DRY. MAYBE SHE DRIED THEM OFF. SUEDE? HEH. PLEASE! LIKE, WHAT'S THAT? [LOUD BUZZER] Freddy: SOMEONE'S TRYING TO LET THE RAIN IN! AND RUIN TOMORROW'S GAME. Fred: THE CONTROLS FOR THE ROOF HAVE TO BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. THERE THEY ARE! Daphne: NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET PAST OLD TALL, DARK, AND TERRIBLE. OK, HERE'S THE PLAN. SHAGGY, YOU AND SCOOBY CREATE A DIVERSION. RIGHT. DAPHNE, YOU AND VELMA WILL JUMP OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF AND GET TO THAT CONTROL PANEL. Both: CHECK. WHAT ABOUT MEEEEE?! WELL, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE YOUR WAY OVER TO THE-- AAH! AAH! [WHIMPERING] HOO HOO HOO HAH HAH HAH! COME ON, SCOOB! SCOOBY, COME ON. YOU CAN DO IT! COME ON, SCOOBY. OH, NO! SCOOBY'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT! OH-OH-OH! HUH? OOH... Velma: FREDDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AND, WE'RE...SAFE! [BUZZ] WHAAA! EEEH! OH, NO, YOU DON'T. HE'S GOING TO HIT THE FIELD! JEEPERS! HE WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE FIELD. OH, GREAT. LET ME GUESS. THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THE DARK, CREEPY, SPOOKY CATACOMBS. I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THESE OLD TUNNELS. A PICKLE BARREL! OOH HOO HOO! MAN, THESE THINGS ARE RIPE! YEAH! P-U! WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS. THOSE AREN'T PICKLES. THEY'RE BASEBALLS, AND THEY'RE SOAKING IN KEROSENE. YOU'D HAVE TO BE PRETTY HUNGRY TO EAT PICKLED BASEBALLS. THEY'RE NOT FOR EATING. THEY'RE FOR THROWING FLAMING FASTBALLS... BY THE BASEBALL SPECTER. WELL, GANG, IT'S MORNING. LET'S GET UP TO THE FIELD AND SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND SOME MORE CLUES. FRED, YOU MEAN GET OUT OF THIS COBWEB-FILLED CATACOMB AND INTO THE NICE, SAFE SUNSHINE? OH, MAN, LIKE, YOU TALKED ME INTO IT. YEAH, ME, TOO! SHOT OUT OF A CANNON? NO WAY! I'M AN ATHLETE, NOT AN IDIOT. I QUIT! SCOOB, MAYBE HE CAN GET WORK AS A BEARSKIN RUG. Bob: HA. THAT KID SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF LUCKY. I COULDN'T GET A JOB BUT I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO TO GET BY. I PAINTED HOUSES, GAVE PIANO LESSONS, EVEN DID A STINT AS A DOG GROOMER. DOG GROOMER? SURE. HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU. JUST BRUSH THIS, STRAIGHTEN THAT, ADD A LITTLE MOUSSE, MAYBE A NICE BOW, AND VOILA! WELL, I'D BETTER GET BACK UP TO THE BOOTH. BYE, KIDS. HEY, LUIS, ARE YOU READY FOR THE BIG GAME? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS OLD FILM OF CAB CRAIG. HE WAS MY IDOL. HMM... HEY, LIKE, WHERE ARE ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS? THE GAME STARTS IN 15 MINUTES. I GUESS THEY WERE SCARED OFF BY THE SPECTER. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FORFEIT THE GAME. FORFEIT THE GAME? NO WAY! YOU'VE GOTTA BREAK THAT RECORD. I THINK I'VE GOT THIS MYSTERY JUST ABOUT WRAPPED UP. AND I KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP LUIS AND CATCH THAT BASEBALL SPECTER. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT FOR BASEBALL AS THE GRIZZLIES TAKE THE FIELD. DO YOU THINK SCOOB'S OK? ARE YOU KIDDING? WHAT A HAM. [CHEERS AND LAUGHTER] [GIGGLES] HEY, I SAW-- [BURPS] OK, FANS, STEVE POWELL WITH YOU TO CALL THE THIRD INNING. AND STEPPING TO THE PLATE IS LUIS SANTIAGO, WHO IS ONLY ONE HOME RUN AWAY FROM BREAKING THE RECORD. Steve: IT'S THE BASEBALL SPECTER'S SECOND APPEARANCE IN AS MANY GAMES. HE HAS 4 SCARES IN 7 ATTEMPTS. NOW, DAPHNE! [ROARING] OK, SHAGGY! TIME FOR PHASE 2! LIKE, HELP! SHAGGY! Steve: IT'S A BALL, BALL, STRIKE, BALL, STRIKE, BALL, STRIKE, STRIKE! [PANTING] WHEW! [ROARING] MY PLAN IS WORKING PERFECTLY. NOW ALL SCOOBY HAS TO DO IS LURE THE SPECTER INTO THE CANNON. [ROARING] WE DID IT! PLUG YOUR EARS, SCOOB. [DINGS] HUH? HUH? HUH? HMM... I WONDER WHAT-- [ALL SCREAMING] I CAN'T SEE WHO IT IS. JUST TAKE A LOOK UP THERE. All: BOB TAYLOR! [CROWD BOOS] OUR FIRST CLUE WAS WHEN WE SAW THE SPECTER PLAYING THE STADIUM ORGAN. Daphne: BOB TAYLOR TOLD US THAT WHEN HE COULDN'T GET HIRED WITH A BASEBALL TEAM, HE USED TO GIVE PIANO LESSONS. BUT THERE WAS ONE CLUE THAT REALLY PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. NOTICE WHEN CAB THROWS OUT THE RUNNER, HE THROWS WITH HIS RIGHT ARM. THE BASEBALL SPECTER IS A LEFTY. AND ACCORDING TO BOB'S BASEBALL CARD, SO IS HE. BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS? BECAUSE CAB CRAIG WAS MY BEST FRIEND. I WANTED HIS RECORD TO STAND FOREVER. BUT WHAT ABOUT AUTUMN? I SURE THOUGHT IT WAS SUSPICIOUS THAT HER SHOES WERE DRY IF SHE LEFT THE PARK. WELL, A GIRL'S GOTTA BE PREPARED, DON'T YOU THINK? WOW! I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID THAT. PLAY BALL! HERE YOU GO, SHAGGY. I MADE YOU A CARAMEL CORN, SALTED PEANUT, COTTON CANDY, CHOCOLATE MALT SANDWICH! I THINK I'M IN LOVE. [CHOMP] I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK. HEY, GUYS, I WAS TOLD YOU MIGHT HAVE AN EXTRA SEAT UP HERE SO I COULD WATCH THE GAME. WOW! IT'S MIKE PIAZZA! OF COURSE YOU CAN WATCH THE GAME WITH US. I CAME HERE TO SEE IF LUIS CAN BREAK THE RECORD. UH, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME FOOD, MIKE? SURE. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? UM, ACTUALLY, I JUST ATE. THANKS, ANYWAY. HEY, LOOK! LUIS IS COMING TO THE PLATE! [STADIUM ORGAN PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING WILDLY] Steve: AND LUIS SANTIAGO HAS BROKEN THE RECORD! HE'S BROKEN THE RECORD! ALL WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THOSE MEDDLING KIDS. WAY TO GO, LUIS! YOU DID IT!
