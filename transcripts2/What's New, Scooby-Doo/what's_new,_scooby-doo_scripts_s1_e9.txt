 [GERMAN ACCENT] FRITZ, THEY ARE SWIMMING SO FAR FROM THE BOAT. [GERMAN ACCENT] OH, STOP WORRYING, LIEBSHON. THE KINDER ARE HAVING FUN. THERE'S NOTHING HERE BUT HARMLESS-- SEA MONSTER! STEPHANIE! [SHOUTS IN GERMAN] AHH. All: AAH! All: AAH! LIKE, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT, RIGHT, SCOOB? YEAH, MORE LIKE IT. NO GRIZZLY GRAVEYARDS, SPOOKY SPECTERS, OR GHOULISH GHOSTS. NOTHING BUT SUN AND FUN. HA HA HA! AND WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN. HA HA HA! YOU SAID IT. [PANTING] SURE WAS NICE OF--UHH-- DAPHNE'S FATHER TO LET US USE HIS COMPANY'S--UHH-- TIME-SHARE. HEY, YOU WANT TO PLAY? NO, THANKS, FRED. LIKE, JUST WATCHING YOU IS MAKING ME TIRED. HA HA. I'M RESTING UP FOR OUR TRIP TO AQUALAND TOMORROW. IF WE HAVE TO TAKE A VACATION, AT LEAST THE ISLAND OF FAJA MANU OFFERS AN INTERESTING ASSORTMENT OF AQUATIC ANIMALS TO STUDY. LIKE, I'D RATHER STUDY THIS DELICIOUS JERK-BOY SANDWICH. HEY! ZOINKS! MONSTER! Velma: THAT'S NO MONSTER, SILLY. IT'S A SEA TURTLE. UH-OH. IT'S HEADED BACK INTO THE WATER, AND DAPHNE'S SURFING OUT THERE. RELAX, FREDDY. SEA TURTLES ARE HARMLESS. WE'RE MORE OF A THREAT TO THEM. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK THAT MAN IS THE MOST DANGEROUS CREATURE OUT THERE. HEY, MAINLANDER, WHATCHA THINK YOU'RE DOING IN STINK EYE'S SPOT? HI. I'M PRETTY SURE I'M SURFING. WRONG! YOU'RE LEAVING, PRINCESS. LOCALS ONLY. WHY DON'T YOU GET A PEDICURE AND LET THE ISLAND BOYS SURF THE BIG WAVES? LATER. HA HA HA. HA, YOU'RE THE BOSS! HUH? HEY! WHAT'S UP? FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I'VE ALREADY HAD A PEDICURE, AND THIS IS MY RIDE. [ROARS] JEEPERS! DAPHNE, ARE YOU OK? DID YOU SEE THE SEA MONSTER? IT WAS HUGE AND GREEN AND UGLY ALL OVER. SOUNDS LIKE THAT SALAD WE HAD ON THE AIRPLANE. DAPHNE, I THINK YOUR BOARD MUST HAVE BONKED YOU ON THE HEAD. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT IN THESE WATERS. AH, JA, BUT THERE IS, THERE IS, JUNG LADY. JA, IT SUNK OUR BOAT UND MANY OTHERS ALSO. Velma: A SEA MONSTER? THAT'S A STATISTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY. THEN, VELMA, WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS? THIS BITE IS TWICE AS BIG AS ANY SHARK'S MOUTH. IT COULD EAT AS MUCH IN ONE GULP AS SCOOBY AND SHAGGY DO ALL DAY. HMM. HMM. MR. BLAKE, YOUR LUGGAGE FINALLY CAME FROM THE AIRPORT. WHICH ONE-- I'M MR. BLAKE-- I MEAN, I'M DAPHNE BLAKE, HIS DAUGHTER. I AM SHARKY TAZO, CONCIERGE, GUIDE, AND LOCAL JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES FOR THE GRANVILLE RESORT. ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO FOR YOU? NOT UNLESS YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT A CERTAIN BIG, SLIMY SEA MONSTER. THE MOTOSHONDU? SURE, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT, MON. YOU DO? THE MOTOSHONDU IS THE ISLAND SPIRIT. LEGEND SAY SHE RISES FROM THE DEPTHS WHENEVER FAJA MANU IS THREATENED. MY SURFING ISN'T THAT THREATENING. A LOT OF LOCALS THINK THAT ALL THE TOURISTS OFFEND MOTOSHONDU. THAT'S WHY SHE SINKS THEIR BOATS. WELL, GANG, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT A MYSTERY TO SOLVE AND A MONSTER TO FIND. BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND A SEA MONSTER IN ALL THAT OCEAN? Sharky: YOU CAN'T, MON. MOTOSHONDU'S A SPIRIT, BUT IF IT'S A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE OCEAN YOU WANT, I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT. [ALL GASP] Daphne: IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. WHAT'S THAT DOWN THERE, SHARKY? MORAKEMI REEF. THAT'S WHERE MOTOSHONDU SUNK THE RENTAL BOATS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET A CLOSER LOOK. I KNOW A GUY. HE'LL GIVE YOU A MUCH CLOSER LOOK. Man: WELL, CAN'T GET MUCH CLOSER THAN THIS, FOLKS. JEEPERS, LOOK, A MANTA RAY. JINKIES, A JELLYFISH. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? CRUNCHY'S GLASS-BOTTOM BOAT TOUR RULES! HA! CRUNCHY, AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF THE MOTOSHONDU? DUDE, I'VE BROUGHT ABOUT A ZILLION TOURISTS TO THE REEF ON THE BIG BLUE MAMA HERE, AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING BUT THE WONDERS OF NATURE. Velma: WHAT ABOUT ALL THE WRECKED BOATS? OH, BAD KARMA. JEEPERS! WHAT'S THAT? ZOINKS! IT'S THE SEA MONSTER! NO WAY! IT'S HERE FOR HER NOON FEEDING, AND WE'RE THE FOOD! All: WHOA! CRUNCHY, LOOK OUT! UHH! UHH! [GASPS] All: WHOA! Crunchy: OH! MY BOAT! YOU OVERGROWN SEA MONKEY! I WILL GET YOU FOR THIS, MAN! I WILL GET YOU, BELIEVE IT! HEY, NO NEED TO SHOUT, MAN. YOU'LL BE RIGHT NEXT TO HER IN A MINUTE. All: WHOA! [ALL CRYING AND WHIMPERING] Shaggy: WELL, SCOOB, I'M JUST SORRY IT HAD TO END THIS WAY. WHAT WAY? ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. [LAUGHS] [CRIES] OW! Crunchy: YO, CHECK IT OUT! Daphne: IT'S SHARKY, HERE TO RESCUE US. EVERYBODY UP THE LADDER. I'LL HOLD OFF THIS WATER WEIRDO TILL YOU'RE SAFE. [BOTH GASPING FOR AIR] UHH. UHH. THANKS, SCOOB. YOU SAVED ME. HOW DID YOU GET AWAY FROM THE MOTOSHONDU, FREDDY? I DIDN'T. WHEN I GOT DOWN THERE, IT HAD DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE. AND THEN I GOT BLINDSIDED BY A HUGE GROUP OF SEA TURTLES. I THINK THE PIECES OF THIS PUZZLE MIGHT FIT TOGETHER BETTER IF WE KNEW MORE ABOUT THESE SEA TURTLES. SCOOB, ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING? Shaggy: WE'RE GOING TO... Shaggy and Scooby: AQUALAND! Velma: THANK YOU FOR SEEING US ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE, PROFESSOR RAVENMANE. IT'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL, VELMA, AND CALL ME MAURA. I GUESS WE'RE TOO LATE FOR THE SHOW, HUH, MAURA? AQUALAND IS MUCH MORE THAN AN OCEAN PARK, SHAGGY. IT'S A MARINE LAB DEDICATED TO PRESERVING ALL MANNER OF ENDANGERED UNDERSEA LIFE. LIKE THE SEA TURTLES WE SAW? EXACTLY. WE OFTEN NURSE INJURED TURTLES LIKE THIS ONE BACK TO HEALTH. HE DOES LOOK A LITTLE GREEN AROUND THE GILLS. OH, I KNOW JUST HOW HE FEELS. THAT CHOPPY SEA MADE MINCEMEAT OUT OF ME. SEASICK, SHAGGY? I KNOW JUST HOW YOU FEEL. I GET SEASICK, TOO. WHY DON'T YOU HELP YOURSELF TO THE AQUALAND SNACK BAR? A LITTLE SOMETHING TO SETTLE THE STOMACH ALWAYS HELPS ME. Both: UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH. MMM. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, SCOOB, BUT A LITTLE FOOD IN MY BELLY AND MY FEET ON DRY LAND, AND I'M RIGHT AS RAIN. HA HA HA HA. ME, TOO. CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MOTOSHONDU, PROFESSOR? I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR RIDICULOUS MYTHS AND LEGENDS. MARINE BIOLOGY IS SERIOUS WORK. OCEAN BREEDING GROUNDS LIKE MORAKEMI REEF ARE IN TERRIBLE DANGER. SPEAKING OF TERRIBLE DANGER, LOOK! Shaggy: HELP! LIKE, THE MONSTER'S GOT US! THAT'S NO MONSTER, SHAGGY. THAT'S BECKY, OUR TRAINED ORCA. SHE LOVES PEOPLE. I HOPE SHE DOESN'T LOVE US THE SAME WAY I LOVE ONION RINGS. SHE'S PERFECTLY TAME. LET ME HELP YOU OUT OF THERE. Shaggy: I GUESS THE SHUSHI'S ON THE OTHER FOOT. [LAUGHS] ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING? THAT MAURA'S HAIRSTYLE IS ALL WRONG FOR HER FACE? THAT, TOO, BUT NO. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO MORAKEMI REEF FOR A CLOSER LOOK AT THOSE TURTLES. HELLO. SHARKY? ANYBODY HERE? Daphne: WHAT A MESS. Velma: THIS IS ALL WATERLOGGED NAUTICAL GEAR. WHAT'S A PILOT DOING WITH-- LIKE, STUFF FROM CRUNCHY'S BOAT? GOOD QUESTION. I--I CAN EXPLAIN. THIS IS ALL SALVAGE. LOOK! CRUNCHY'S HAT. BUT HE HAD THIS ON WHEN WE WERE RESCUED. HOW DID IT END UP BACK IN THE WATER? HE MUST'VE GONE BACK. IF HE WENT BACK OUT THERE WITH THAT MONSTER, HE'S CRAZIER THAN THIS HAT. COME ON, GANG. LET'S CHECK IT OUT. Daphne: LOOKS LIKE NOBODY'S HOME. LIKE, DOESN'T ANYONE EVER WORK ON THIS ISLAND? HEY! KICKIN' HOME THEATER. CHECK OUT HOW CLEAR THE DVD PICTURE IS ON THIS FLAT PLASMA SCREEN. LOOKS LIKE CRUNCHY HAS FISH ON THE BRAIN. HE MUST'VE SHOT THIS THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF HIS BOAT. SPEAKING OF BOATS, IT LOOKS LIKE ONE IS MISSING. DO YOU THINK CRUNCHY WENT AFTER MOTOSHONDU IN THAT LITTLE DINGHY? IF HE DID, HE'S A LITTLE DINGIE. WE HAVE TO FIND HIM BEFORE HE BECOMES A BITE-SIZED MORSEL FOR THAT KING-SIZED MONSTER. IT SURE WAS NICE OF MAURA RAVENMANE AND HER STAFF TO LOAN US ALL THIS HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT. SHE EVEN HAD PRESCRIPTION LENS GOGGLES FOR ME. LIKE, TOO BAD SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO COME ALONG. HMM. I WONDER WHAT WOULD KEEP A MARINE BIOLOGIST AWAY FROM A HUGE DISCOVERY LIKE A SEA MONSTER. Shaggy: SELF-PRESERVATION. SHE'S A SMART LADY. SHE EVEN CURED MY SEASICKNESS. SEE? HUH? [ROARS] DON'T PANIC! IT CAN'T GET US HERE IN THE BOAT. Shaggy: OK. NOW WE CAN PANIC! All: AAH! * CHEWING OUT A RHYTHM ON MY BUBBLEGUM * * THE SUN IS OUT AND I WANT SOME * * IT'S NOT HARD, NOT FAR TO REACH * * WE CAN HITCH A RIDE TO ROCKAWAY BEACH * * ROCK, ROCK, ROCKAWAY BEACH * * ROCK, ROCK, ROCKAWAY BEACH * * ROCK, ROCK, ROCKAWAY BEACH * * WE CAN HITCH A RIDE TO ROCKAWAY BEACH * * IT'S NOT HARD, NOT FAR TO REACH * * WE CAN HITCH A RIDE TO ROCKAWAY BEACH * * IT'S NOT HARD, NOT FAR TO REACH * * WE CAN HITCH A RIDE TO ROCKAWAY BEACH * * ROCK, ROCK, ROCKAWAY BEACH * * ROCK, ROCK, ROCKAWAY BEACH * * ROCK, ROCK, ROCKAWAY BEACH * * WE CAN HITCH A RIDE TO ROCKAWAY BEACH * [SHRIEKING] NO BOAT, NO RADIO, NO SCOOBY SNACKS. WE'RE SUNK! QUICK, GANG! SCRAMBLE INTO THE SCUBA GEAR. I BET WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS MYSTERY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. GO DOWN THERE WITH THAT SICKENING SEA SNAKE? NO WAY! THEN YOU TWO CAN WAIT FOR US HERE... ALL ALONE. OH, NO, DAPHNE. WE'LL BE JUST FINE UP HERE. [ROARS] Both: AAH! [ROARING] LIKE, GOIN' DOWN. NEXT STOP: OCEAN FLOOR! [CLICKING] ARE YOU READIN' ME, SCOOB? I'M GETTIN' SOME FUNKY STATIC. [TEETH CHATTERING] THAT'S BETTER. HEY! LIKE, WHAT'S THAT? AAH! AAH! [BOTH GIGGLING] [WHIRRING] OH, NO, SCOOB! HERE IT COMES AGAIN! WHAT ARE YOU TWO CHICKENS OF THE SEA DOING DOWN HERE? VELMA, WE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE MONSTER. YOU SOUND JUST LIKE HER. HEY, CHECK OUT THE COOL SCUBA BIKES WE SCAVENGED FROM THE SHIPWRECK. Fred: WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, CHECK THIS OUT. JEEPERS. A GRAVEYARD OF WRECKED SHIPS. OH! WHY GRAVEYARD? WHY NOT JUNKYARD OF WRECKED SHIPS OR PARKING LOT OF WRECKED SHIPS? NOW, IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE. WHEN MOTOSHONDU COMES THROUGH THIS GAP IN THE REEF, AT VELMA'S SIGNAL, DAPHNE AND I WILL USE THE JETS FROM THE SCUBA BIKES TO TOPPLE THESE PRECARIOUSLY BALANCED HULKS. AS SOON AS GREEN, GILLED, AND GORY SWIMS THROUGH THAT GAP, TIMBER! I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT HAVING LIVE BAIT TAKEN OFF MY RESUME. ME, TOO. UNH. JINKIES! MY GOGGLES. SCOOBY, CAN YOU HELP ME FIND MY PRESCRIPTION GOGGLES? [TEETH CHATTERING] [TEETH CHATTERING] [ROARS] All: AAH! DAPHNE, NOW! COME ON, SCOOB. WE CAN HIDE IN HERE. HOLD ON, SCOOB! Both: WHOA! UNH. WHEW. WE MADE IT, SCOOB. WE'RE SAFE. Both: AAH! FASTER, SCOOB! FASTER! PADDLE! MOVE IT, WAVE HOG! LIKE, THANKS, DAPH. I'VE HEARD OF MONSTER WAVES BEFORE, BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. HUH? Scooby-Doo: WHOA! [GIGGLING] WIPEOUT! YOU MADE IT! GIRL, YA SHRED THAT SICK WAVE LIKE AN ISLANDER. THAT WAS A SERIOUSLY HAIRY RIDE. NOT AS HAIRY AS MOTOSHONDU'S. Shaggy: HOLY MACKEREL! [GIGGLES] GET IT, SCOOB? I GET IT. HEE HEE HEE. HEY, LOOK! THE OUTER LAYER OF THE CREATURE IS MADE OF RUBBER. [HOLLOW THUMP] RIGHT. INSIDE IS A MINIATURE SUBMARINE WITH THE SAME KIND OF WATER PROPULSION AS OUR SCUBA BIKES. THAT'S WHY IT MADE THE SAME NOISE. All: CRUNCHY? OK, OK. I GOT ABOUT AS FAR AS THE MONSTER IS A MINI-SUB BEFORE YOU, LIKE, TOTALLY LOST ME. IT'S SIMPLE. CRUNCHY IS AN ECOLOGY EXTREMIST. HE WANTED TO PROTECT THE TURTLES' MATING GROUNDS, AND HE USED THE MONSTER TO DO IT. HEY, I THOUGHT PROFESSOR RAVENMANE WAS THE BIG TURTLE LOVER. I AM... BUT NO LEGITIMATE MEMBER OF THE CONSERVATION COMMUNITY WOULD CONDONE THIS DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. BESIDES, WE KNEW THAT MAURA COULDN'T BE THE MONSTER. SHE GETS SEASICK. BUT HE WAS ON THE GLASS-BOTTOM BOAT WITH US WHEN THE MONSTER ATTACKED. THERE WAS NO ATTACK, SHAGGY. THERE WASN'T EVEN A GLASS BOTTOM. IT WAS REALLY A FLAT-SCREEN TV BOTTOM BOAT. THAT DVD WE WATCHED WASN'T JUST SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW ON THE BOAT. IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW. A C.G.I. MONSTER SHOWS UP A MINUTE LATER. Fred: HE USED THE VIDEO TO SCARE AWAY TOURISTS. THE NAME TAG ON CRUNCHY'S LIFE VEST SAID, "CHARLES GRANVILLE." THAT'S CRUNCHY'S REAL NAME. AND WE'RE STAYING AT THE GRANVILLE RESORTS. HE'S NO BEACHCOMBER AND NO MONSTER EITHER. AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU MEDDLING MAINLANDERS, I'D HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT, TOO. I'M SO GLAD THAT THE AQUALAND TEAM IS GOING TO CLEAN UP THE REEF. ME, TOO, AND I'M, LIKE, REALLY GLAD WE CAN FINALLY HAVE SOME NON-MONSTER FUN IN THE SUN. I'M GOING HYDROPLANE WATER-SKIING. [CHILDREN LAUGH] HEY, WHO ARE YOU? WE'RE THE KEENAN FAMILY. AND AS OF 5 MINUTES AGO, THIS BECAME OUR TIME-SHARE. WHO ARE YOU? LIKE, A BUNCH OF KIDS WHO ARE ABOUT TO HAVE THEIR RELAXING VACATION ON THE PLANE RIDE HOME. HOME SOUNDS GREAT TO ME, AND IT LOOKS LIKE SCOOBY'S READY TO GO, TOO. YIKES! OOH. HELLO. AWW. SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO!
