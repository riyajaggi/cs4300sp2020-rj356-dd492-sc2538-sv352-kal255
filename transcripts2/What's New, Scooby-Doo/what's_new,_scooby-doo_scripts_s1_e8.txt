 [GHOSTLY FLUTE PULSING] HUH? OHH! HUH? WHAT IN THE WORLD'S THAT SOUND? IT IS NOT OF THIS WORLD. IT'S THE DEMONS. [ALL GROWLING] GREAT SCOTT, THEY'RE STALKING US! RUN! OHH! AAH! OH! AAH! THERE ARE MODERN CITIES ALL OVER AFRICA, SHAGGY. ZOMBA HAD THE NEAREST AIRPORT TO THE HATARI GAME PRESERVE. Daphne: AND THAT'S WERE OUR VIDEO SAFARI BEGINS. IMAGINE...REAL LIONS, ELEPHANTS, CHEETAHS, ZEBRAS. UP UNTIL NOW, I'VE ONLY MET THE ANIMAL CRACKER KIND. MANY SPECIES ARE VANISHING FROM THIS PART OF AFRICA, AND NOT JUST THE ENDANGERED ONES. I WANTED TO GO ON THIS TRIP AND PUT THEM ON TAPE WHILE WE STILL CAN. Fred: AAANNND CUT! OK, UH, TRY ANOTHER TAKE, GIRLS, BUT THIS TIME WITH A LITTLE MORE SINCERITY. FREDDY, PLEASE SAVE YOUR VIDEO VERITE FOR THE ANIMALS. SORRY. GUESS I'M EAGER TO TRY OUT THE NEW ATTACHMENTS. LETTERBOX PANORAMIC FRAMING. SWEET! HMM. TOO BAD IT CUTS OFF YOUR HEADS. LIKE, FRED, AT LEAST I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SMILING WITH MY MOUTH FULL. THEY'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME TO TAPE US WHEN WE REACH THE SAFARI. EXCUSE ME. YOU'RE ON THE SAFARI? YEP. WE'RE GONNA VIDEO THE BIG GAME, EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE TALLER GIRAFFES. WELL, WE'RE ON IT, TOO! IT'S A THRILLING TRIP. WE KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IT 3 TIMES BEFORE. YOU COULD CALL THIS OUR FOURTH HONEYMOON. I'M HONEY HUNSECKER, AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND HENRY. HEH HEH, HI! HENRY AND HONEY HUNSECKER. HEH HEH! LIKE I JUST HAD TO SAY THAT MYSELF. WE'RE FRED, VELMA, DAPHNE, SHAGGY, AND SCOOBY-DOO, DOCUMENTARIANS EXTRAORDINAIRE. HAVE YOU HEARD THE RUMORS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME TROUBLE WITH THE ANIMALS VANISHING? TROUBLE? NOT A WORD. THE WORST YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MIGHT BE THE INSTANT CHANGES IN WEATHER. [THUNDER CRACKS] All: HEY! HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH! Daphne: HATARI. THAT'S AN INTERESTING WORD. Velma: IT MEANS "DANGER" IN SWAHILI. Shaggy: ZOINKS! WHY DIDN'T WE PICK A PLACE THAT MEANS "TEENS EAT FREE?" WHICH REMINDS ME, I PACKED A SANDWICH. HEY, FELLAS, BACK OFF! WAIT! THIS IS MY ONLY PRE-LUNCH SNACK! HUH? [TRUMPETS] WOW! ANIMALS ALREADY! EXCEPT I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE'D BE SO MANY BUGS. AND THE HUMIDITY'S TOTALED MY HAIR. BETTER GET USED TO IT. IT'S 800 MILES TO THE NEXT SALON. GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OWN. PROVIDES A FIRM HOLD, AND KILLS INSECTS. HEH HEH HEH! HMM? HUH?! Man: JOCKO? WHERE ARE YOU, JOCKO? HAVE YOU SEEN JOCKO? HE'S ABOUT THIS HIGH, FUZZY? OH, THERE YOU ARE! WE'LL BE JOINING YOUR SAFARI. NAMES LLOYD M'BUKU. I'M IN THE SOUVENIR T-SHIRT GAME. AND OF COURSE, THAT'S JOCKO. JOCKO? MR. AND MRS. HUNSECKER! HIYA, CAP N'! FOLKS, MEET CAP N' ROBBIE KUMBAZI FROM CAPETOWN COLLEGE. AHOY, CAP N'. SO YOU'LL BE TAKING US DOWN THE RIVER? I PLAN TO, BUT YOU GUYS HAVE COME AT KIND OF A BAD TIME. I THOUGHT WE BEAT THE MONSOONS. IF ONLY IT WERE JUST THAT. THE ANIMALS ON THE PRESERVE SEEM TO BE THINNING OUT. YES, WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOUR ENDANGERED SPECIES. IT'S STRANGER THAN THAT. DR. GOODFEW EVEN TRAVELED OUT HERE TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THE JOAN GOODFEW? THE FAMOUS ZOOLOGIST? I'VE BEEN TAGGING THE ANIMALS IN THIS PRESERVE TO TRACK THEIR HABITS. BUT LATELY, ALL I'M FINDING ARE THE TAGS AND NO ANIMALS. Both: HUH?! IT'S AWFUL! GOOD THING YOU'RE HERE. WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOU. I BELIEVE THAT CIVILIZATION'S WHAT'S FRIGHTENING CREATURES AWAY. I FROWN ON VIDEO SAFARIS. FROWN? NO, SMILE! GUESS SHE HAVEN'T HEARD YET ABOUT THE DEMON WARNINGS. WHAT DEMON WARNINGS?! I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO THE NEWS TODAY. STORIES HAVE COME BACK FROM WEST OF THE OCUZI RIVER ABOUT SHAPE-SHIFTING JUNGLE DEMONS. SUPPOSEDLY ANGERED BY THE ANIMALS' DISAPPEARANCE, THEY ATTACK IN THE FORM OF MYSTERIOUS FEROCIOUS BEASTS. MYSTERIOUS? HMM. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT WE'D FIND A MYSTERY AS FAR AWAY AS AFRICA? SO I GUESS LEAVING THIS INSTANT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION? THE ANIMALS ARE IN TROUBLE. MAYBE OUR DOCUMENTARY COULD HELP IN SOME WAY. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOU DOWN RIVER. I JUST CAN'T PROMISE YOU WHAT TO EXPECT. WELL, WE'RE GOING, TOO. I HAVE MY BIG STRONG FELLA TO PROTECT ME. OH, NO NEED TO WORRY. ME AND MY BOAT NEVER GO WEST OF THE OCUZI. Fred: OOPS! AH, MUCH BETTER. OK, LOOK--LOOK LAZY! NO PROBLEM. WELL, THIS ISN'T SO BAD. SNACKS, COOL BREEZES, AND THE CD I BURNED OF MY FAVORITE TUNES. UH-HUH! AND, LIKE, BEST OF ALL... HEH HEH! NO DANGEROUS JUNGLE BEASTS. UH-UH. Honey: AH! SUNSET ON THE OCUZI RIVER. NOTHING LIKE IT, EH, HENRY? MAKES ME FEEL WARM AND FUZZY. LET'S HOPE THE ANIMALS STAY THAT WAY, TOO. I'VE BEEN SEARCHING THE SHORE FOR ANIMAL POPULATIONS. SO FAR, NOTHING. THEY WERE THRIVING OUT THERE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO. WHERE COULD THEY HAVE GONE? WISH I KNEW. BUT WE'LL BE REACHING A FERTILE VELDT IN THE MORNING THAT USUALLY ATTRACTS CREATURES FROM MILES AROUND. NICE HAT, DAPH. NOW YOUR OUTFIT'S COMPLETE. SURE IS. LOOK WHAT I CAME UP WITH. BUG BLINDS. [MUSIC BLARING THROUGH HEADPHONES] YIKES! YIKES! DOUBLE YIKES! YIKES, YIKES! Fred: GREAT FEAR REACTION, GUYS! LET'S GO FOR THE REVERSE ANGLE. [GIGGLING] Fred: I GOT SOME GREAT SHOTS WITH THIS INFRARED NIGHT SCOPE FEATURE. HEY. WAIT A MINUTE. LOOK AT THIS. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A SHAPE-SHIFTING JUNGLE DEMON? HARD TO TELL. [GHOSTLY FLUTE PULSING] WHAT'S THAT? LIKE, WHATEVER THAT IS, IT'S COMING FROM THE SCARY SIDE OF THE RIVER! KEEP CALM. I'M STEERING AWAY. All: OHH! THE RAPIDS! THEY'RE TOO STRONG! All: WHOA! WE'RE OFF COURSE! WE'RE HEADING FOR KAMAHARA FALLS! I NEED HELP! All: WHOA! AAH! All: UHH! HEY! YES! WE DID IT! WE'RE SAFE! YES! WE'RE SAFE, WE'RE SAFE! DO YOU REALIZE WHERE WE ARE? WE'RE STRANDED ON LAND WEST OF THE OCUZI RIVER. OOH-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO! LIKE, WE'RE NOT SO SAFE! [SNIFFS] HUH? [WHINES] HEY! YOU MADE IT! SO DID YOU! GREAT! YEAH! GWEAT! [CHATTERS] BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HUNSECKERS? HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT. I FOUND THEM! WE JUST WANTED A MOMENT TO REMINISCE. THAT CATASTROPHE REMINDED US OF OUR WEDDING NIGHT AT NIAGARA FALLS. THOSE PEOPLE ARE SO DARN CHIPPER. I FOUND THIS WALLET. IT BELONGS TO MR. M'BUKU-- OHH! HEY! I'M GLAD WE ALL SURVIVED THE RIVER. NORMALLY, WE WOULD'VE BEEN EATEN BY CROCODILES. [GULPS] LIKE, THAT'S ONE MEAL I CAN LIVE WITHOUT. ANIMALS! BUT THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE. Velma: WHILE ARE THEY GLOWING? BECAUSE THEY'RE DEMONS. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! DO WE HAVE A MAP? WE LOST THE MAPS IN THE RAPIDS. BUT IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE RIVER BACK, WE SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE GETTING TO THE PRESERVE. THERE ARE MORE AND MORE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE EXPLAINED. WELL, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. THAT T-SHIRT SALESMAN M'BUKU? INSIDE HIS WALLET, THERE'S A POLICE BADGE. ARE WE THERE YET? WE'VE ONLY BEEN WALKING FOR 15 MINUTES. SEEMS LIKE FOREVER. THIS PLACE NEEDS A.C. IT'S TOO HOT. YEAH. TOO HOT. THERE'S A WATERING HOLE. WITH ANIMALS! Honey: OH, LOOK DEAR! SHOW TIME! LET'S KEEP OUR DISTANCE. DON'T FRIGHTEN THEM. YEAH. BUT HOW DO WE KEEP THEM FROM FRIGHTENING US? DON'T WORRY. THEY'RE HERBIVORES. YOU KNOW, VEGETARIANS? NOT SHAG-ATARIANS. [CHATTERING] [GROWLS] LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE PRETTY FRIENDLY. WE FINALLY FOUND SOME WILDLIFE! BUT AT A BIG WATERING HOLE LIKE THIS, THERE SHOULD BE LOTS MORE THAN TWO. Dr. Goodfew: THERE CERTAINLY SHOULD. DR. GOODFEW. HOW DID YOU GET OUT HERE? I'M FOLLOWING THE RIVER, SEARCHING FOR ANY REMAINING ANIMALS. AT LEAST THESE TWO ARE ALL RIGHT. BUT THEIR HERDS ARE DRASTICALLY THIN. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS DEMON STORY? I BELIEVE THAT ANIMALS ARE SHRINKING FROM THE INVASION OF MODERN LIFE. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Shaggy: YOUR SERVE! [BUZZER SOUNDS] I FROWN ON FRATERNIZATION BETWEEN MAN AND BEAST. JUST ONCE SHE COULD SMILE. KIND OF A COINCIDENCE THAT SHE'D APPEAR OUT HERE IN THE LANDS OF THE DEMON LEGEND. IT'S TOO HOT TO PROCEED ANY FURTHER. LET'S REST AND RESUME WALKING AFTER IT COOLS OFF TONIGHT. Fred: AND CUT! VERY REAL. VERY CONVINCING. WHEW! AND A GOOD IDEA. [GHOSTLY FLUTE PULSING] GAME CALLED ON ACCOUNT OF DEMONS! UH-OH! HANGING OUR THINGS FROM VINES. GREAT IDEA, DAPHNE. SOMETHING I REMEMBERED FROM BONFIRE GIRLS. KEEPS EVERYTHING SAFE FROM MUD, MOISTURE, AND SOLDIER ANTS. NOT TO MENTION LIONS, LEOPARDS, AND SNAKES. OH, MY! THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HERE. BUT FOR A PLACE THAT'S SCARCE ON ANIMALS, IT'S ODD THERE ARE SO MANY BUGS. ACK! IF THERE WERE THIS MANY BUGS WHERE I LIVED, LIKE, I'D BE SCARCE, TOO! [ANIMALS GROWLING] [ROARS] YIKES! THE DEMONS OF THE JUNGLE ARE BACK! EVERYONE, SPLIT UP! Velma: JINKIES! * TOTALLY CERTAIN * TOTALLY CERTAIN [ELEPHANT TRUMPETS] * TOTALLY * HEY, MONKEY * I'M ON MY WAY TO YOU * MONKEY, YEAH * YOU'RE LOSING IT, YOU'RE LOSING * * YOU'RE LOSING IT, YOU'RE LOSING * * YOU'RE LOSING IT, YOU'RE LOSING * * YOU'RE LOSING IT * TOTALLY CERTAIN HUH? OH. AH... AH...AH... AH...AH-CHOO! [GHOSTLY FLUTE PULSING] WELL, IF ANYONE ASKS WHETHER DEMON ANIMALS ARE SHAPE-SHIFTING AROUND THIS JUNGLE, LIKE, I HAVE THE ANSWER. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. WELL, ONE THING I'M SURE OF IS THAT WE'RE LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE, THICK JUNGLE. EXCUSE ME, CAP N'. I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE DIDN'T HAVE A MAP. UH, I WAS SAVING IT FOR AN EMERGENCY. SO, I GUESS THIS EMERGENCY TOPS ALL OUR OTHER EMERGENCIES. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOU HAD IT? OK. IT'S A MAP OF THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER. I HAVE A CLAIM TO A SECRET URANIUM FIELD ON THIS LAND. YOU OWN URANIUM, AND YOU'RE STILL PILOTING A RIVER BOAT? ONE FEEDS THE POCKET, THE OTHER FEEDS THE SOUL. WELL, NOW WHAT WE'RE HOPELESSLY LOST, I GUESS WE'LL BE USING YOUR SECRET MAP? YOU COULD PUT YOUR THUMB OVER THE URANIUM PART. I CAN'T FIND JOCKO ANYWHERE! MY MONKEY'S MISSING! ZOINKS! SO IS SCOOBY! All: OHH! JOCKO! JOCKO! PERHAPS NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO TELL US WHY A T-SHIRT SALESMAN IS CARRYING A POLICE BADGE. YOU KNOW? YES, AND NOW WE NEED TO KNOW WHY. ALL RIGHT. I'M ACTUALLY SERGEANT INSPECTOR M'BUKU WITH THE MALAWI POLICE, HERE TO INVESTIGATE THE ANIMALS DISAPPEARING. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL US THAT? I'M UNDERCOVER. LOOK! [SCREECHES] JOCKO! JOCKO, DOWN-- DOWN, BOY. 10 LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA, MM-MMM. [SCREECHES] LIKE, THIS IS NO TIME FOR JOKING AROUND. WE'VE GOTTA FIND SCOOBY. HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. I'D HARDLY CALL THAT JOKING. BUT I HAVE AN IDEA. * ...ARE YOU, BABY * ARE YOU MY JULIET? * 'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO CUTE... * GOOD GOIN', VELMA. WHEN HE CAN'T HEAR THAT WEIRD MUSIC, HE'S BACK TO NORMAL. WHY IS HE STILL GLOWING? COMPLEXION GLOW WITH ALOE. MAKES FOR A GREAT MAKEUP BASE ON HALLOWEEN. SCOOBY! [CHATTERING] Lloyd: HE WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HIM. HE CAN LEAD US TO SCOOBY. SCOOBY! WHERE ARE YOU, OLD BUDDY, OLD PAL, OLD FRIEND? SO THE SHAPE-SHIFTERS WE WERE WARNED ABOUT ARE JUST REAL ANIMALS COVERED WITH MAKEUP AND HYPED UP BY THAT WEIRD MUSIC. WHO WOULD WANT TO PERFORM SUCH DASTARDLY DEEDS? LOOK, GUYS. WE'RE BACK AT THE RIVER. HEY, WHAT'S THAT BOAT DOING HERE? Dr. Goodfew: GOOD QUESTION. Daphne: DR. GOODFEW. IS THAT YOUR CARGO BOAT? I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING. IT GIVES ME THE WILLIES. I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE IT BE. IS SCOOBY ON THAT BOAT? COULD BE. I THINK WE SHOULD GO ABOARD AND EXPLORE. [SCOOBY HOWLS] Shaggy: SCOOB! IS THAT YOU? THEY'RE HERE! [BOTH GROWL] Scooby: RELP! COMIN', SCOOB! AAH! WHOA! AAH! [LAUGHS] SCOOBY! RAGGY! [CHATTERS] I HAVE A FEELING I KNOW WHO'S BEHIND ALL THIS. THEM! [ALL GROWLING] OH! JUST STAND STILL, HENRY. [GHOSTLY FLUTE PLAYS] YOU BOTH ARE UNDER ARREST. [GROWLS] HUH? [ALL CHATTER] Daphne: A MONKEY FAMILY REUNION. HEY, WHY WOULD THIS NICE COUPLE TAKE ALL THE ANIMALS? STEALING INNOCENT ANIMALS OUT OF THE JUNGLE? IT MUST BE FOR THEIR OWN GAIN. THAT'S IT. THEY'RE POACHERS. W-WE DON'T HARM ANY OF THEM. THERE ARE LOTS OF RICH PEOPLE IN THE STATES WHO WANT EXOTIC PETS. TREATING THESE BEAUTIFUL BEASTS AS PETS WOULD HARM THEM ALL. WELL, THANKS TO YOU, WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT ANY LONGER. VELMA AND I FIGURED OUT WHY THERE WERE SO MANY BUGS WHEN THERE WERE NO ANIMALS. BUGS ARE IMPERVIOUS TO SOUND, AND THIS SOUND CONTROLLED THE ANIMALS. OH, GET AWAY FROM HIM, YOU FLOOZIE! THESE TWO WERE JUST A LITTLE TOO LOVEY-DOVEY. THAT'S BECAUSE HONEY OPERATED A REMOTE TRANSMITTER ON HENRY'S SHOULDER WHICH ACTIVATED BROADCASTING EQUIPMENT ON THAT BOAT. THE FLUTE MUSIC FED INTO THAT DEMON'S NET AND COVERED THAT BUZZING SOUND WHICH WAS GEARED TO HYPNOTIZE ANIMALS. [FLUTE MUSIC STOPS] SO THAT'S HOW THEY COULD ATTRACT ANIMALS AND MAKE THEM ACT STRANGE AND SCARY. YEAH, AND EVEN SHY, SNOOTY, AND SILLY. [ALL LAUGH] COME ON, YOU TWO. LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE BEING STUCK IN THE HOLD. I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS WERE MEDDLING. NO, I TOLD YOU. AND I ALSO TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO NIAGARA FALLS. THE ONLY THING WE CAN POACH THERE IS EGGS. WE SHOULD BE UPRIVER BY NIGHTFALL. WELL, FRED, ONCE AGAIN, YOU'RE OUR HERO. WE SHOULD HAVE A GREAT DOCUMENTARY ABOUT SAVING ANIMALS. NO, YOU'RE THE HERO, DAPHNE, NABBING THE HUNSECKERS. WHAT MADE YOU THINK THEY WERE THE CULPRITS? WITH ALL THE BUGS, SNAKES, BLISTERING HEAT, HUMIDITY, AND FLESH-EATING PLANTS AROUND HERE, IT'S GREAT FOR ADVENTURE BUT NOT FOR ROMANTIC HONEYMOONS. YEAH. [ALL LAUGH] [ELEPHANT TRUMPETS] YIKES! NOT AGAIN! HEY, MAN, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT? Daphne: THEY'RE PERFORMING FOR OUR VIDEO. THAT'S IT. ENERGY. ENERGY. NOW ACT NATURAL. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING? SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO! Man: MAMA AFRICA.
