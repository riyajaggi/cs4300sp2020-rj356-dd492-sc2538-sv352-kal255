 Dad! Dad, there's a fire! Dad, get up! Dad, get up! Dad! You have to get up! Dad, get up! Dad, come on! Operator? Yeah, I'm at the San Pablo Bay. My house is on fire. You got to get some guys down here now. Hey. You got someplace to go? Grandma's. We'll call her for you. He's dead, isn't he? I'm sorry. You're the one that called us, right? Yes, sir. From where? That phone booth way down there? Yeah. Wow. That's quite a run. What's your name?

 Reuben. Tell you what, Reuben. You can run like that, they ought to call you Rabbit. The medic's name was Johnny. He was... I had to wait an hour before I could go to my grandmother's. So then, um, you know, they took me down to the station and, uh, they gave me Otter Pops. As many as I wanted. All the trucks were there. All the chrome was all shiny, and I don't know, it was the coolest place I've ever been. Still is. How long has it been since you told anybody this? Never. I don't talk about it. No, I say my dad died from smoking. You lose your father at 13. In many ways you feel that it's your fault. Let's go back to... Well, it was my fault. No. Hold that for a second. Okay? Let's go back to that day. The paramedics, the fire fighters... When you looked at them, what did you see? Um, I saw uniform, badge, um, just some guys trying to make things right. And you try to follow their path, their lead. Yeah... Riding in, saving the day, saving a life. Saving... Yeah. Sure. You know, whatever you can. You want to be that man, that uniform. There's a name for that guy, you know. What, the hero? Jung called the archetype the hero complex, which is not a disorder. It's not even a problem. For a lot of people in medicine or law enforcement, it works. But, Reuben, it's not working for you, is it? Well, it did. It did work, you know. But, um, I suppose... I don't know what happened. I just started screwing up at work and... And screwing up on my relationship. I don't... I don't even have a relationship. Why do you think that is? Come on, I'm like the poster child for PTSD. Who told you that? Everybody, man. Everybody since I got back from the crash. Everyone at work, they're all like, "You know, you got PTSD. "You got Post Traumatic Stress... " You don't have Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. I don't? You have post-traumatic issues from the helicopter crash. What's the difference? Well, the crash just ripped open issues from earlier material. Let me ask you a question. Was there a fire when you crashed? Oh, yeah. Lots of fire. Were you scared? Yeah, I was scared. I thought I was gonna get burned alive. Did you feel powerless? Yeah. I couldn't do anything. They were dying, and I couldn't stop the... They were all dead. And there was nothing that I could do to stop it and I... And I should. So you can bring back your father? You can't. Oh, wow. You can't. That's a simple fact. Oh, wow, that's... No. That's... That's fresh. After your father died... Yeah. ... you saw what you wanted to be, who you wanted to be. Okay. You should revel in that. Okay, our time's up, but I... I want to take another step further with you. Doc, I... Last thing I need is drugs, okay? Oh, tell me about it. Nope. This is not a prescription. Well, not the kind that you think. I want you to go back to work. Are you serious? Yeah. Well, that's it? That's it, I'm cured? Oh, God, no. You're a mess. Well, that's not a clinical term, but it works. However, you can go back. Okay. Okay. Come on. Let's go call your grandma. I was here first. No. Come here. Get your coats. Oh, thank you. Thank you. There you go. Put your coat on. All right. And your hat. Bills, huh? Yeah. Two of our credit cards raised their interest rates, so it's making things very, very difficult. Well, I'll just take some extra shifts. That's easy. Please. I do not want you to take more shifts. Mommy made some lunch. You guys should go get your lunchbox, okay? Peanut butter and jelly. Yes. So... I don't know. Can you talk to Basra about the captain's job? I mean, I can talk to him, but he's still out, so... They're rotating acting captains. You know they got that guy, Captain... You remember Captain Cal? Those old commercials. Yeah. Really? He's there? Yeah, he's there. He's there. Do you think he could make you captain? No. He... I don't think so, you know? Hey, Gina. Hey. Running late? Yeah. A little. You're missing an earring. Oh, well, I guess I can be tragically hip today. Yeah. Good luck with that. Oh, jeez, Glenn, this coffee is God awful. Sorry. I was just running a little late. What's going on? Nothing. I was just running late. You're seeing somebody. You sound like me, you know that? Who is she? No one. You can't squirrel out of this one, Glenn. I've got you. Well, maybe I could just look you in the eye and lie, like you did about Rabbit. That was very different. No, it's not. Mmm-hmm. How is he doing anyway? How are you guys? What's he like on suspension? Okay. We are not talking about me and Rabbit. This is a change of subject. And besides, I'm not dealing with him right now, because he needs to sort his head out. Is that a hickey? What? What is with you? Are you in junior high? I have no idea what you're talking about. Hey, Boone, he cannot even concentrate on making decent coffee because he's too distracted with his special little somebody. The coffee's fine. And he has a hickey. The coffee is fine. A hickey. See? I don't have a hickey on my neck. I'm going. I'll make some coffee in about 10 minutes. Do you see that? Did you see that hickey? It's not a hickey! Did you see it? I will get it out of you! Yeah. It's only a matter of time. So, who do I got today? Me, all day. Yay. Mmm-hmm. Yo. Hey, man. Yo, yo, yo, hey, hey, let's get out of here right now. For what? For what? Captain Cal, that's what. He got rid of all the Stay-Awake. You should see this guy... Damn straight I did, sideburns. Okay. Here you go. I'll tell you something, in my day we didn't need or have energy drinks. They're chock full of taurine, caffeine, crap-eine. They dehydrate you, they make you shaky. We had good old coffee, which, by the way, where the hell is it? This way. This way. How are you? Cal Channing. Oh, pleasure to meet you. I know who you are. Grew up watching all your commercials. Oh. You medic or EMT? Uh, I'm a medic. He's an EMT. Yeah, I'm down here. See? This is a man who knows what's what. Oh, why? Because he watches a lot of TV, makes him wise? Let me ask you something, sideburns. Are you one of those counter-culture type guys? As a matter of fact, Cal, you know, I've got... I burn my candle on both ends, is what some people call it. I'll tell you something, ever since they combined fire and EMS, things have just gone crazy as hell, you know what I mean? I mean, you kids, you play hell with protocol. It makes us all look bad. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Here's looking at you, kid. Ah. Hot and nasty. Yeah. Just like my men. Sir, we have to go. And it was a pleasure meeting you. We got a shift. Hey, Reno. Hey, man. What's up, bro? How's it going? How're you doing, man? How's it going for you? Good? Yeah, good. Take 'em out, a little dancing. All right. Gotta go to work. Hello? How are you doing, buddy? How are you doing? You know? Angel Rescue 2 coordinate with Fire Rescue on Burlington junkyard. Man trapped under wreckage, possible crush injuries. Benny, let's go. Sit down, Benny. Finish your food. I got it. What the hell are you doing here? Hi, Marisa, good to see you, too. Look, I'm cleared to work. We've got to go. Okay. So what do we got? Uh, we got a junkyard rescue and medevac. Rescue and medevac. See, that's what I'm talking about. Full on mass hero action. Just what the doctor ordered. Yeah, but it's a balls out call, Rabbit. So, you're glad to see me? Come on. Can we just cut the crap for one second? Just one little second? Yeah, will you grab that? Okay. Rabbit, I really like working with you, I do. I thoroughly enjoy it, okay? But I need to know, no BS, please, can you do this? I don't know. Is that okay? That's probably the most honest thing you've ever said to me. Good, let's do it. Come on, my friend is really hurt. He's been stuck under the hood. I'll show you where he is. Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's your name? CJ. Yeah? Yeah. Can you feel your hand? No! All right, CJ, I need you to be very quiet. As quiet as you can, okay? I need to think. I cannot think if you're screaming. That's good, that's good, nice and quiet. Quiet. Okay, nice and tight. All right, okay. Give me your arm. That's good. One and two. This is just a little morphine, okay? It's going to help a lot. Hang in there, bud. We're nearly there. Okay. Let me do this, okay? Don't move. Yeah, that's good. It's still attached. That's good. Oh, God! Oh, look at that? Ain't that pretty? Quiet, quiet. Please, I can't think. Come on. Give me your hand. Jokes keep rolling. Am I going to be crippled? Crippled? Uh, maybe we should talk about that later. Twenty-five-year-old male having multiple seizures. I put him on 10 megs of diazapan on the way over, but he's not responding. He's been having intermittent seizures for the last 24 hours. Well, I'll work him up and draw some stat levels. Thanks, Nancy. You got it. See you tonight. Oh, you little liar. What the hell are you talking about? You lied straight to my face. I knew that she was your special somebody. You're crazy. You're high, you know that? Why do you even care? You jealous? Nope. Not even a little? No. No, Glenn, I'm not jealous. I'm just curious. You're just curious? Uh-huh. Why are you curious? You really want to know? Not now. I thought he was suspended. So did I. I'll let you talk to him. Rabbit. Hey. When were you going to tell me you were coming back to work? Um, now? I only just found out today. I wasn't expecting it, and then she cleared me. Can you believe it? Look, we haven't been talking. No. So... I thought that I'd give you some space. Sure as hell looked like you needed it. Yeah. Yeah, I did, I did. Okay, I don't really want to do this right here, right now. I do want to talk to you. All right? I've got some things that I want to say that I think would help both of us, but I really got to work right now. Okay? I mean... Yeah. Do I have a choice? Not right now, but... You know, nobody should be forced to watch you eat. Nobody's forcing you. Please, let's get back to business. All right. Can I just... Can I just savor it for two seconds? Seriously. It's my jam... Seriously, why do you keep blowing off the paramedic exam? You want to be a lowly EMT forever? That's EMT Two, and I've been busy. You gotta study. This test is no joke, bro. No joke. Yeah. You just watched Stand and Deliver, didn't you? I love that movie, too. It's a little preachy for me, but... You should just get your EMT-P Certificate, okay? You don't have to do all this overtime. You'll make much more money. No, see, I don't do it for the money. Whatever. No, look. I'll pull more cash, but then we won't get to ride together anymore, you know? No more Boone and Tyler Show. Or did you forget that? Station Four runs one medic, one EMT in all the rigs. No dual medic. Is that what this is? No. It's not that, bro. It's about that... You want to get rid of me. You're trying to get rid of me, aren't you? Huh? So you can take the captain's job. I get it. Medic 78, request assistance at 540 Broward. Fifty-five-year-old male, weakness and shortness of breath. Over here, guys. Okay. Hey, sir, how are you? Okay, I'm Boone this is Tyler, we're medics. Okay, can you walk? Can you get up? I don't think so. Sir, I'm going to ask you a couple of questions. I'm not an alcoholic or an IV drug user. That'd be the first question I'd ask in this neighborhood. Yeah, do the pressure. See what's going on. It's been a while, but I usually run 150 over 90. Hypertension? Like you wouldn't believe. Wow. Well, you beat your record. 160 over 100. That's stage two. Pulse is 100 and what? Ten. What, are you, a doctor? I wish. It's uremic frost. This man's in renal failure. Sir, we need to get you to the hospital. All right? Yeah, you do. Look, tell me you're taking me to City. I can't afford a private hospital. Well, you know the drill pretty well. You been working the system a while? Buddy, I used to be the system. I was a paramedic. Hey, come by and visit sometime, all of you. See you, Chas. Make it kind of quick, you know? Yeah. If he's right about his condition, he'll need either regular dialysis or a transplant to survive. I doubt if he's wrong. I doubt he'll be able to pay for either one. You want me to keep you posted on it? Yeah, please do. Sure. Take it easy, boys. Later, Dr. Bro-sif. What's up, dawg? What's up, man? Hey, Tyler. Yo. How many 55-year-old paramedics do you know? Uh... I mean, still on the box? Right. It's a young man's job. Well, then what are you still doing here, Grandpa? No, seriously. You ever think about what's next? Uh, what's next? I don't know, let me take a stab. We get in the rig, I drive. We hold the wall. Something nasty happens to somebody, we deal with it, we go get noodles, then we do it all over again 'cause that's what we do. No, no, no, no, no. See it's easy for you not to think about the future. I have responsibilities. I have kids, bro. It could be us, 55 years old alone in a room, dying of renal failure. You know what I mean? I think you're taking it a little far. Hello, kids. Captain Cal here. Remember, when you're in trouble, there's only one thing to be done. Dial 9-1-1. That's great. That's you, huh? That's cool. And who the hell are you? Rabbit Palchuk, flight medic. A man named Rabbit? Yeah, just about as weird as a man in California named... Cal. Cal, yeah. All right. Here, sit. So, they got you covering for Basra? Well, I asked for it. So what can I do you for, Rabbit? Ah, yeah, right. So, I got this for the captain or acting captain. Uh-huh. It's a note from the doctor saying that I'm fit to return to work. I meant to drop it off this morning, but, uh... You hurt yourself out there, huh? Yeah. A while ago now, so... You're him. Yeah, you're the medic from the Montgomery crash. I'll be damned. Well... It's an honor to meet you. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. You bet. Thank you. Rabbit, where the hell are you? We've got an organ transfer. Let's go! All right, there it is. I've got to go. So if you'll just pass that along. Good to meet you. Of course. Good to see you. Take care. My God. This place is a madhouse. Oh, good, they sent you. What's going on? Dispatch said it was a domestic violence call. Yeah, it is, but it's not the black eye and broken bones kind. God, you are dead, bitch. You are dead, you are so dead! I'm going to kill you! Go to hell! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you! I want you to die. You are so dead. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to come back and I'm going to cut you with a knife. Oh, no. We've treated her before. I'll take him, you take her. Prince Charming over there shot her. Can you feel your legs? Yes. Does it hurt when you breathe? Yes, yes. Yes, it hurts. You've got to move your hands, you've got to move your hands. Hey, Valencia, do you remember me? Yeah, I remember. You're the nice one. Give me some space with your hands. Yeah, listen. Can I take a look? Can I take a look? You're dead! He shot me. I wasn't going to take it anymore. Just shut up! You see this? You see what she did to me? Yes. Yes, sir, I see what she did to you. Am I... Am I in trouble? Lift your head? Can you lift your head? The cops will take care of that, but, no, I don't think so. Nancy, through and through. I got... Blood loss is manageable. Okay. I want you to clean it, dress it, start a line. Hold this for me. Take it out, take it out! I can't take it out. Believe me, you do not want me to do that right now. Glenn, I need you over here. Listen, I'm going to go over and help Nancy, okay? I'll see you at the hospital, okay? You promise? Glenn! Yeah, I promise. Yeah? This is a load and go. Get the board. Hey, Nancy, what's up? Hey, Diana, I need Dr. Joe as soon as possible. He's not here. What's going on? I've got a 32-year-old white male who's got a penetrating knife wound to his abdomen. He's actively bleeding. I think the knife must have cut or nicked his superior mesenteric artery. I need to go in and shut down the bleeding. No, just bring the patient here as quickly as you can and we'll handle it in surgery. It's fine, Diana. I've done it once before. Dr. Joe talked me through. He's not here right now, and you won't do this on my watch. It's out of your scope and I won't be liable. Just manage fluid replacement and bring him here ASAP. I'll have a team ready for you. He crashed. Estimated blood loss 1000 ccs. He was tachycardic, hypotensive en route. Now he's gone into hemmorhagic shock. Yeah, he's flatlined on arrival. All right, we got it. Someone going to take over on this? Yeah, we're on it. Thank you, Nancy. Thank you. All right. Okay, let's change gurneys. On my count, one, two, three. Let's get that gurney out of here. Okay. Get two units of blood in here stat. I got it. Starting CPR. Where's that blood? Go ahead, ask me. Ask you? Yeah, go on. I know you want to know what happened with the therapy. Go on, ask me. Whatever you want. Uh, no. I really don't want to know what's going on in your therapy. Oh. Oh, really? No. You don't want to know? I don't need to know the details of what goes on in that man-child head of yours. Okay, fantastic. We're done then. Great, wonderful. Good. Great. I mean, it's not like I tell you everything. Oh, oil pressure's low. Not a biggie. She's an old burner. It's the bypass valves. I don't think so. You better check that out. Let's go back. Oh. Nice one. No, I'm serious. Come on. Contrary to popular belief, I love my life and I want to stay alive. Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. Come on, call it. Okay. Control, this is Angel Rescue 2. I got a warning light on oil pressure and I'm heading back to Angel Rescue to have that checked out. Copy that, Angel 2. We lost him, Nancy. No, Diana. You lost him. If you had let me follow my instincts and let me do what I do best, then that man would still be alive. Oh, I hate to burst this entitled bubble you like to live in, but that was not your call. The decision was a doctor's, the procedure was a doctor's, the responsibility was a doctor's. Graduating from medical school does not qualify you to practice medicine. I sucked it up, took a residency, did the work. And I'm not going to risk it all for some paramedic who wants to play it both ways. Now, Dr. Joe might turn a blind eye or, worse, encourage you, but he's 20 years my senior and has a history here. I don't. Yeah, you might want to think about that. I'm not going to back down personally or professionally because you grew up in this hospital and have Dr. Joe wrapped around your finger. Your job ends at those doors and if you've got a problem with that, you can take up a residency, put on some scrubs and show us how it's done. I got work to do. I guess third time's a charm for our girl, Valencia, huh, Nance? It was a bad call. Yeah, but I could have handled it. Well, I hate to say it, but I think that guy finally got what he deserves. According to Dr. Van Dine, it is no longer my responsibility to make calls on my patients. Real ego on that one, Glenn. She's right. You're not a doctor, you're a paramedic. And I'm sorry, Nance, but this awesome guy who just shot his girlfriend, no paramedic could have saved him. So, that's the limits to the gig, right? I do not need to hear this from you. I don't know who you're hearing it from, but apparently you're not listening. Medic 114, request assistance at 568 Barham. Chest pains, shortness of breath. Sixty-four-year-old female with cardiac history. Control, this is Medic 114. We're on it. And there's no more mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Am I right? You don't get down there and do the old mouth-to-mouth anymore. There isn't any pre-cordial thump. None of that. You just sort of maintain the pressure. It's different. I'll tell you something else, GPS. We didn't have any GPS. You poached, you wildcatted, you'd jump on a run. Am I right, Rabbit? That is right, Captain. You tell 'em. You would jump on them, all right. It didn't matter. Whoa! I guess you're pretty lucky you slipped back in with Captain Cal on the job. Yeah? Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't bust your balls a little more. No, no, we go back, me and Captain Cal. We're buds. Yeah, you think? You guys are lucky you came in. You had three cracked bypass valves. You could have gotten in serious trouble up there. Probably won't have it fixed until tomorrow. All right. Thanks, Rich. Yeah. Please. Oh, God, no, you're going to drop me. We got you. Ready? Oh, you're going to drop me. Oh, with your legs. Okay, here we go. Ready? Ready? Okay. I'm ready. Yeah. You're right there. Come on. How is it? Okay. Please. I got it, I got it, I got it. All right. Lean her back, lean her back. Yeah. You got that corner? Okay. Don't drop me. He's not going to make it! Ma'am please, all right? No, no, no. Oh, you're going to drop me. It's okay. All right, here's the sequel, part two. No, no. Ready? You're nice, but this isn't going to work. What perfume are you wearing? It smells really nice. Please, please, I don't want to be here. Hey, guys, this is Janet, 43 years old. I don't want to be here. Bedbound, type 2 diabetes. She's having trouble breathing. We have her on O2. That's mine, that's my sandwich. Please. That's my sandwich. This is her sandwich. Boone, don't eat that... That was her sandwich. Here you go, ma'am. Don't eat it. Thank you. Oh. Ah. That's my hand. What is going on around here? What do you mean, what's going on around here? We are helping a very scared and sick woman who happens to have brought her own lunch. Dude, we're getting too old for this. Too old? Okay, Danny Glover, why don't you just admit it to me, huh? Just come out and say it. You want off the rig. You want to ride a desk into your golden years, I get it. I have not even made up my mind yet. You have... Yes, you have. Come on, look, I'm your partner and, more importantly, I'm your friend. And, look, you don't have to hold back your career for me. Just like I don't have to hold mine back for you. What are you talking about? I took the paramedic's exam. I passed. Why are you looking at me like that? You didn't think I could pass, did you? I can pass a test. Okay. I'm happy for you. So, look, they're going to put me with an EMT when Basra gets back. Sorry I didn't say anything before, but it's kind of hectic if you hadn't noticed. So, do your thing, man. What's right for you and Sela. You do you, I do me, right? What else is new? Yeah. All right. Hey, Boone. Hey. Good to see you. Yeah. Good to see you, too. How are you doing? Ah, you know, I need a kidney transplant. But this'll do till they kick me out. You mind if I ask you a question? No. Shoot. What happened? Didn't plan. Didn't stay any place long enough to pension out. I just worked. Double, triple shifts. Balls out 24l7. Yeah, I know a guy like that. Yeah? Yeah. Does he save his money? He's like a Scrooge with it. Well, that's good. I didn't. I was having too much fun. Man, I was made for speed. I just wasn't made to last. Dying just never freaks me out. Ever. See, I'm one of those guys who always wants to know what's next. You know? Yeah. I thought you might. Yeah? Well, listen, the next time you find somebody who's in trouble, you give our home team a call, all right? Yes, I know. I sound a lot like him. All right. Goodbye. Hey, Cal. Hey, Baz. What? You come here to ruin my fun. How are you feeling? Better. Ready to come back. You having a good time? Oh, yeah. I'm having a great time. Yeah, it's been good being in the mix. I know, I know. In case you haven't noticed, I've been kind of out to pasture these days. Well... I don't really know what to do with myself, you know? Hmm. Maybe I'm just holding on to those glory days. I don't know. But just... What the hell do you do? You know? These kids, they don't have a clue as to who we are or what we did in the day. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Come on, follow me. I want to show you something. Come on. I got something for this man. Captain Cal, I usually freebase these, but I hear you can drink them. And, yes, they do make you weird. Sideburns. Cheers. Cheers. Boone, you got a second? I want to talk to you. All right, Cal, don't be a stranger. Thanks, Rabbit. So, how you feeling? Oh, I still got a few miles left in me, but it's time I start to think about retirement. Why don't you talk to Captain Cal? No, I don't know about that. But he did have a recommendation for who would make an outstanding captain. He recommended Rabbit. Cal's a little better at PR than he is administration. All right. But seriously, Cameron it's a career path that's open to you. It's not the box, but your friends out there in the department could always use a good leader. You know Tyler made paramedic? Mmm-hmm, I know. And I know splitting you two up probably affects your decision. You guys are my best team, but you know, just like me, nothing lasts forever. So, what's next? You know, I got an idea about that. Hey. I'm sorry about earlier. I... I was pissed that you didn't tell me you were coming back to work and it was selfish. When I was 13 years old, I burned down my home accidentally, and my father, who was very drunk at the time, died in that fire. So, I've been spending my whole life trying to save my dad, who probably was never really worth saving. I've never told anyone that. Ever. Anyone. Not even someone I'm seeing. That's what we're doing here? Seeing each other? Yep, that's what we're doing. Oh, Rabbit. I was... I screwed up so badly today. What? Welcome to my world. Well, I'm not used to it, okay? You might be. I totally flipped out on Diana. Sorry, on Dr. Van Dine. Oh, yeah, yeah. Tell me, tell me. Well, she called me out on this patient. Yeah. And she was totally right. She was, she was right. Mommy's up! Mommy! Oh, well, well, well. Yay! Hey, Mom. Yay, what's going on? Sit down. I made you a royal breakfast. You sure did. What's... What's the occasion? Well, I wanted to talk to everybody before I headed out. I got offered the captain's job. Oh! Congratulations! I know. Oh, honey. That's great. Yeah. Congratulations. Honey? What? What's going on? You look like you lost your best friend. What do you think I should do? I'll do whatever you want me to do. Cameron, I think you should do what you love. Just do what you love. What time is it? 7:00. Oh, I got to go. Why didn't you... Why... Isn't there an alarm? I didn't know when you had to go. Don't you have to get ready? You're going to be late, too. I have the day off. I think I hate you. Really? It didn't feel that way last night. Or this morning? All right, I've got to go. I've got to do all the... Where's my shoes? I've got to do all the probie stuff. Coffee and papers and all that. So... Shoes, yeah. See you. I'll see you. Bye. Bye. Nice work, probie. Did I get fired? No, Glenn. Congratulations, you are no longer on probation. I know you had two weeks, but we pushed it up. There's a new probie. Where is he? I want to meet the poor bastard. I think he's getting plates and napkins. For what? For... Probie cake. You knew about this? Nancy told me. All right, now I'm really confused. That is what we're here for, buddy. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thanks. Oh, you guys are sick. Yeah, I think it's the job. It breeds sickness. I love frosting. I want some of that. You guys look like you're having fun, though. Yeah, you guys look so pretty. So, a little action? Yeah. I'll beat you anyway. You know, I just wanted to tell you that it's been an honor to ride with you and to be your friend these last three years. Me, too. When do you start, Captain Boone? I don't. I asked Basra to let us ride as dual medics for a while. You mean, you and me. Hmm. Two paramedics in a rig? One on one, man. That's badass. That's like... Like we're equal. Right? Like ebony and ivory. Yeah. Like, you drive every once in a while. Okay, let my hand go, bro. No, man, I'm not driving and that's that. It's like a white thing, isn't it? Yeah. Probie! More coffee! All right, all right. Wait a minute. I'm on disciplinary probation, so anyone else here calls me probie, except her, I'm going to kick your ass. Probie! A warehouse fire in South San Francisco. All available rigs provide back up to SFFD. Got our name written all over it. Ah. So why don't you take a piece to go? I wanted to. Hey. Thank you. Good job. Thanks, Baz. Congratulations, Glenn. Thanks, probie. Don't eat it all. Save some for later. See you, Rabbit.
