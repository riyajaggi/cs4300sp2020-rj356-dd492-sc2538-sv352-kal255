 "I never yet did hear "that the bruis'd heart was pierced through the ear. " I don't get it. Oh, what? I hate this stupid door. I can take a look at that if you want later. Do you want? Hey, hey, why don't you come back to bed? I am already late for work. No. Okay? You know, you don't sound so well. Your throat, you got something. You don't wanna... Come on, just call in sick. Rabbit, we both have work to do. Come to bed. I don't have work. I'm on vacation.

 Okay, FYI, suspension is not vacation. Oh, it's the same thing. Come on, really. I mean, suspension, vacation, I got time off. I can fix your door, I can... Okay, enough. Wait. Enough. I appreciate all the attention and the help and everything else, but honestly, enough. Appreciate? What's appreciate? What's that mean? You know what I mean. No. I don't know what you mean. Okay. You cannot solve all of your problems in my bed. But I can try. No. If you just... No. ... give me a chance.

 No. You need therapy. Therapy? You really think that I need a therapist, a shrink? I think you need to talk to someone. That's what you're for. That's why I want you to stay here and talk to me. Come on. Rabbit, okay, this is not a new issue. Come on. This has not just happened to you. You've been on a runaway train ever since you came back to work.

Way to go! Yeah. The best thing is you didn't even pass out. Thanks, Nancy. My pleasure. No, he didn't pass out. See? You say I never do anything for you. Guys, I miss Rabbit. Who's with me? No? He loves baby breakfast. Yeah, Rabbit loves any breakfast. Hmm? Come on. You miss him. Admit it. No, I don't. Come on, cop to it. No, why? Are you kidding? Everything with him is like this side of psychotic. Yeah, but it's fun. Tyler, you live long enough with crazy, you start accepting it as normal. Well, I'll tell you what, I miss him, a lot. Who's Bas got you riding with? I don't know. Hey, is there a Marisa Benez here? Yeah. Hi. Hi. Oh! Can I be you today? Nope. I'm Andy. I'm Marisa. When I'm free Free falling Free falling When I'm... Hey. Yeah, I can't do it anymore, Frida. I quit. We talked about this. Okay, listen. Yes... I was going nowhere with that job. If you want me to talk to you, you're going to have to calm down. Goodbye. Angel Rescue 2, respond to multi-system trauma. Requires immediate medevac. You guys, get that deer off of there, huh? All right. Sir, can you hear my voice? Stabilize his neck.

Come on. Dr. Joe, I've got traumatic full arrest. I got to call it. All signs negative? You've done all you can do? Yes. All right, go ahead. Call it. Marisa, stop CPR. I think we got it. Marisa, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. He's done fighting, okay? Hey. Damn. This really bothers you, doesn't it? Yeah. Medics who aren't affected by something like this... Those are the ones you got to worry about. So, I'd like you to sit down, Mr. Palchuck. Do I have to? Yes, you have to. This is cool. Please put that down and sit down. Okay. Thank you. So, why are you here? Well, I guess to get my head screwed on right. Well, your file's a very interesting read. Thank you. I can see why your superiors are concerned. That a judgment? I thought you therapists... Well... ...aren't supposed to judge people. Well, it's an observation, given the number of incidents in your file. Uh, yeah. Sometimes I got a bit of a short fuse. You wiped blood on an FBI Agent. We therapists call that acting out. He had it coming. I'll tell you. You had to be there. Okay, I need you to stop that right now. Oh, sorry. No, but, I mean, really. He had a woman shot in the back of the head. Yeah, okay, well... I was covered in... Have they all had it coming to them? ...brain matter. The obese patient? The driver? He lost his finger. Have they all had it coming? All these people? Could I see that list? Smearing blood on an agent. Was that your way of showing him what he'd done? You had blood on your hands. Did you feel he should, too? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I did. I don't know. I don't know, you know? To be honest, it's just that in that situation, you know, your blood starts to boil, and then, well, boom, you know? So, tell me about the helicopter crash. Oh. Yeah, I was in a helicopter crash. Well, you know... I'm lucky to be here. Not here. You know, here. Okay, Reuben, tell me something. Your life has brought you to this place, right? Yes. I mean, it doesn't matter how you got here. Your superiors, your behavior, whatever. You are here. Are you willing to do the work? Absolutely. You packed a doggie bag? It's not every day I get breakfast in my honor, so, yeah. So, you're gonna make the most of it, huh? What are you, like, 12 years old? They're all chocolate. You're pathetic. This is the first time that anyone's ever treated me like anything other than a probie, so... Well, you're not gonna be a probie for much longer. I was wondering when you were gonna notice that. Oh, I noticed. Of course I noticed. Why else do you think I let you do that delivery? All right. Hey, Di. Did you just ditch your work wife for me? Wow, I'm honored. Work wife? What? You are gonna miss me, aren't you? Miss you? What are you talking about? Did you get fired? Is that... Can you get fired? How does that work? No, I didn't get fired, but it's telling that that's the first thing that came to your mind. I get it. So you must have left an instrument inside of a patient during surgery. Now you have to flee. No. My trauma rotation is up. Your trauma... What? Your what? Wait. Wait a sec. What? Yeah, I've been sampling the snacks before I choose my specialty. So, this... This was just a short-term... Temporary. Yeah, but you're not leaving, right? I mean, you're still gonna be here. Well, I mean, how often do you see the oncology residents upstairs? Wow. I'm never gonna see you, am I? Come celebrate. End-of-rotation drink. Bunch of us are gonna be at the Hidden Cove. I don't know. Oh, come on. There are gonna be girls there who haven't let their hair down in seven months and will hook up with anything with a pulse and a smile. A pulse and a smile? I have that. I can do that. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Well, I'll see you... I'll see you there. I'm gonna miss you, Glenn. I'm gonna miss you, too. See you tonight. Yo! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. See, you always do this. You get bored, and you come over here, start messing with my routine. Why? Dude, look, and... It goes this way. Not that way, okay? Everything has its place. What's the difference? Well, 'cause like my papa used to tell me, you keep that gris-gris off of you. What? The bad juju. It fends off the bad juju. I keep to my routine, everything's cool. Dude, you a grown man. What is bad juju? Let me tell you something. My grandfather had the same routine every morning of every day. Kept him safe. And he lived till he was 93, so you tell me now. Okay, so you're superstitious. Okay, I get it. It's not superstitious if it works. Crack a book, man. It's looking good. My daughter! She can't breathe. Okay. Okay, what's your daughter's name? Uh, it's Samantha. Her name's Samantha. Sam. Okay, and tell me, did she do anything unusual before the attack? No, no, she was in the backyard, playing with the dog. Uh, has she got allergies? No, no, nothing that I know of. Sam. Sam, can you hear me? You can? Do you remember getting stung by a bee, a wasp, anything like that today? You do. Okay, epinephrine, 0.3 milligrams, IM. It's okay, honey. It's okay. Honey, it's okay. They're here. Okay, set up the nebulizer. Yeah. I'll do Benadryl. What's wrong? What's wrong with my daughter? She's having an anaphylactic reaction to a bee sting. We're just trying to get her to breathe properly. Well, what can I do? Please, just try and keep out of the way. Let us have room to work. That would be great. Sam, honey, it's gonna be okay. I got it. Daddy's right here. Sam! Okay, she's... She's fainting. I need BVM. Sam! Sam. Okay, I got her. I got her. Please move away, sir. Get the bag under her head. Sir, let us work. You need to step back. Please! I got it. Okay. Can we get the bag underneath her neck? Nancy. Are you okay? Are you okay, sir? Are you okay? Glenn, can you take him up to the rig, get him some oxygen, make sure he doesn't pass out? Sir, why don't you come with me? No, I can't leave her. It's fine. She's in great hands. Come with me to the rig. No, she needs me! Let's take care of you. Let's take care of you. Slow it down. I need an extra rig. 734 Grove Street. 734 Grove Street, code three. Roger that. Rig on the way. She's gonna be okay? Yeah. Yeah. You sure? We've got one of the best paramedics in the city working on her. Your daughter's gonna be fine. You wanna hop up here on the rig for me? Yeah. All right, thank you. All right, right up there. What's your name? Jim. Jim? All right, Jim, I'm just gonna set up some oxygen here. Set you up with that and see if we get you breathing better, see if that doesn't help. All right. All right. How's that? Is that helping? My chest hurts. Your... Okay, your chest... Your chest hurts? Where's the pain? And down my arm. Down... Okay, down your arm. All right, um, can you step up with me? Nancy, uh, I need you here at the rig. Dad's, uh, complaining of chest pains radiating down his left arm. He's diaphoretic, he's sweating, and he's in a lot of pain. I kind of got my hands full down here. You know what to do. All right, all right. All right, Jim. There. I'm gonna get you set up. That's it. That's it. That's it. Oh, good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Dad. Dad. Where... Where's my dad? He's just up there. He's fine, just fine. Good girl. Okay, control, I need my extra rig. Where is it, now? 734 Grove Street. Copy that. Rig should be arriving shortly. Sir, are you on any medications? You allergic to any drugs? No. No? All right. Uh, all right. Sir, you're having a myocardial infarction. It's a heart attack, okay? I'm gonna give you some nitroglycerin. Okay, just lift your tongue, all right? I want to see if this helps. There we go, Jim. Jim? Jim? Nancy, I need you over here. I'm losing him. Is he talking about my dad? What's going on? Okay. I'm sure he'll be just fine. I'll bring him to the hospital for you. Clear. What happened? The monitor read it as an MI, all right? BP 106 systolic. I administered the nitro, and then he just crashed. What? What did I do? What have you given him already? Epi. Okay. Hold CPR. What? What did I do? Let's just go, Glenn. What have you got? You got it? I think you should probably call it, Joe. Ready? Hey, hey. Ready? One, two, three. What are you talking about? We had him the whole way here. He's gone, Glenn. It's an RV infarc. What did you push? I followed protocol. I administered nitro after I pushed the epi. What? Dr. Joe, I'm gonna call it. Time of death, 10:20. Where's the daughter? In trauma bay four. What... What... Hey, would someone tell me what I did wrong? Did I... Did I kill him? Did I kill him? Glenn. Just be straight with me. Tell me what I did wrong. Nothing. You followed protocol. What did I do? You followed protocol. But protocol isn't always right. An RVI is different from a regular myocardial infarction. BP was borderline. Protocol says nitro, but... Sometimes that creates a cascade effect that is impossible to come back from. So I killed him. Look, it's a judgment call. It's the difference between running every call by the book and trusting your instincts. How was I supposed to know? You weren't. I know you hate this, but there are things that you still need to learn. Today you did what you thought was right. Next time you'll know what not to do. I don't think the daughter's gonna care about next time. Listen, hey, we've all been through this. That's why they say throughout training, you know, "It's just a matter of time. You will kill someone. " Look, the first time always sucks. It never gets easier. But you will get better. Oh, yeah, there's still some residual swelling back there, but nothing serious. Can you say "ah" for me, Sam? Ah. There you go. Doing good. Almost done. I think we need to keep an eye on you for a few hours. Did you know that you're allergic to bee stings? No. You're lucky. You know, the first anaphylactic reaction can be very serious. When can I see my dad? I'll check, okay? Should I... I'll tell her about her dad. We're gonna miss you around here. Sam? May I call you Sam? Yeah. You've had a rough morning. Hey. Hey, man. You know you're not supposed to be here, not till you've complied with the terms of your suspension. Oh, I'm compliant now. I'm a new, improved, compliant Rabbit. How do you like that? Yeah, I seen the doctor, and she gave me a report. We had a few laughs. Okay. Yeah. She said, you know, we can get back on the schedule now. Here, read this. What's that? Your doctor's a no-go on coming back to work. You can't dodge this. You have to see her. You know, actually, I'm a little bit concerned about her. She's, uh, you know, giving me those elevator eyes. You can't joke your way out of this. Come on, Bas, come on, man. Just pick up the phone. Give me a shift. I know you can do it. You done it before. You can do it now. Come on, Bas. Rabbit, Rabbit. I'm a fan, but my hands are tied. Come on, man, just give me a shift. Till your psych sheet comes back clean, you're suspended. See the lady. Work your stuff out. Figure it out. Hey. What are you doing? Pre-flight check. Seriously? Not sure I understand the question. It's just, Rabbit never gives a crap about that stuff. Hey, if I'm going to trust this thing with my life, I'm going to damn well know if it's up to snuff. I believe I've died and gone to heaven. So, you don't leave it all up to the mechanics, do you? Oh, hell no. Are you kidding? They miss stuff all the time. Combat pilot, right? Yeah. How do you know? Well, you've got that "This is my baby, don't mess with her" attitude. Uh, so where you at? Uh, right there. Okay. Horizontal stabilizer light. Optimal. Main gen switch on. Good to go. Sir, you don't want to lose that eye, though. Hey, Boone. Sir, do you have a family? Hey, can you see what time it is? Just relax, okay? They want you to be okay. Hey. What? Yo. Hey. After we drop old, uh, Enrique off, how about we go get some noodles? No, man. I want some chicken. What? No. You... You are not going to do this to me again, man. It's my turn. It's not your turn. Dude, it's my turn. Is it Monday, or is it not Monday? Hey, it's my turn to pick. Dude. Hey! Hey! Did he just... Did he just jump out? Hey, turn your car off. Yeah, okay. Got it. Couldn't stop in time. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, man. All right. Okay. All right, let's get him out of there. One, two, three. All right. Roll him. There we go. All right. Okay. Done. He's not breathing. Yeah. He's got an open compound tibia fracture. Pulse is thready, about 150. Whoa, and he's got multiple broken ribs protruding through the skin. Flail chest? Not quite. Let me get this on here. That's it. Yeah. Up. Just jumping out of a moving car like that, what was he thinking, huh? Here we go. Yeah, it's all about soccer on Saturdays. Now I got two games. Mmm-hmm. Then the wife is always dragging me to church on Sundays, so, uh... Oh, that sounds fun. Weekends are a little different these days. Hey, I'm gonna grab something from my locker, okay? Yeah. Hey. Hey. How's suspension? Yeah, it's awesome, you know. I'm getting to all those home improvement things I've been putting off. It's good. It's good. Yeah? Enjoying it, yeah. So, Andy... Yeah. He's, uh... He's great. Don't get too attached, all right, because, I mean, you're gonna get bored real soon. Oh, really? You cannot hang with a cookie-cutter medic like that. Oh, right, 'cause you just know me so well. Yeah, I do. Well, what I know about you is you crave this just as much as I do. That's what I know. Hey, Marisa, we got a call. Hey, come on. Admit it. It's not the same without me. We got to go. Oh, it's definitely not the same without you. Take it easy, Rabbit. Andy. Rabbit. You okay? Yeah, I'm just gonna finish this up. I just want to know... I can see why he wanted to stay in this wonderful country of ours. I mean, it's... Oh, look. Here we go. Frick and Frack, huh? Huh? What? What's with the long faces? RVI nitro cocktail. Dude, that's it. What? What? That's why our last call went to hell. Tyler! No, no, no. We're under probie curse. What? What are you talking about? You kill someone during your probationary period, and the entire station is hit with screwed-up calls until you make a save, which I'm not holding my breath on that one, so... You think this is a joke? This is funny to you? That's a stupid superstition. Superstition. Not if it works, it's not. Thanks. Thanks a lot, guys. Hey! You're welcome. What? Dude, did you see that? Why you got to make a joke out of everything, bro? It's part of my charm. Right? You're cute. Yeah, I know. I know. I did a couple lines of coke. Could that be the problem? Just relax. I'm going to lift your shirt and we're going to take a reading of your heart, okay? Want to get him started? Oh, uh, I'm not that good with the heart stuff. Oh, come on. Take a crack at it. It's good to practice. You're going to let her practice on me? Well, how bad's the pain, scale of one to ten? About a five. She can practice on you. Go for it. It'll be fine. Uh, okay. Uh, right lead here. That's... That's close. Here, let me... Close? Don't sweat it. EMTs aren't really expected to get the leads right. Yeah, well, Rabbit would have kicked my ass for that. Rabbit expects too much from you. No. No. Hey, Joe. Joey, this whole therapy thing is a waste of time. You got to convince Basra I'm not crazy, all right? Who's gonna convince me? Come on. I know I did something wrong, but I don't need a therapist to tell me why. This isn't just about the bank. You've been on the edge for a while. On the edge? Look, I get the job done. You know. At what cost? Have you ever asked yourself why you have this resistance to whatever it is that's building up that stuff inside of you, all this hostility of yours? Yeah, I have thought about it, and I know why. Why? Stupid people. You can't keep deflecting forever, man. You're self-destructing. And the pity of it is you don't even know it. Oh, come on, Joe. Look, I know I've been a bad boy. I get it. But I can change it, all right? No, you can't, not by yourself. Right now you're a danger to yourself and everyone around you. And I don't just mean on the job. Hey, Sam. You don't have to say anything. I just wanted to check on you. You know, it's... It's always strange, 'cause your chart says everything's fine. But everything's not fine. I just wish we could fix that, too. I am so sorry about your dad, deeply sorry. Thank you. Ah, Glenn. Oh, Glenn, I just love what you've done with this lovely day. You screwed it up for all of us, haven't you, buddy? Hey. What? No, I'm just trying to thank him. How'd you get the sandwich shop in on it? You owe me a tuna sub. Enough, Tyler! Enough! Oh, come on. Are you going to get that save today? Okay, guys, thank you. I'll take it from here. Thank you. Sir? Sir, can you hear me? Patient unconscious. Multiple superficial lacerations. Start a line. Probable rib fractures, unstable pelvis. Okay. No breath sounds bilaterally. Come on, Glenn. Come on, buddy. You can do this. I know you can. You've done it a million times before. Come on, Glenn, you can do this, okay? You okay? Shit. Tyler! Here, you got this? I got it. Yeah? I need you. Move aside. Move aside. Take this. Move, move, move. Got it. Okay. Out of the way. Come on, buddy. Okay, I got it. Load and go. Hey, it's Nancy. Leave me a message. Hey. Um, I just got back to your place. Give me a call when you know what you're doing. Okay. Who is it? Come in. I'm not going. That's what they all say. Then I never see them again. No, I'm really not going. Yes. You are. That's why they call it a rotation. I do good work here, don't I? Yes, very. I imagine you'll do good work wherever you go, Diana. You're a talented physician. Thank you. And this isn't a very glamorous rotation, is it? No. We tend to get the blood-and-guts types. Go figure. And rarely does anyone come back to trauma once they've had a taste of more money and better hours, do they? They do not. I make a difference here. I want to stay. Think about what you're doing. I have. This is the one thing that I want to do. You can't know that yet. When you started working trauma, did you know? Yes, but I was an idiot. I want to be here. I should be here. I mean, if you disagree, you can bounce me out, but... I want to declare my specialty in trauma. All right, Dr. Van Dine. Welcome to hell. Angel Rescue 2, respond to possible stroke on Treasure Island. Requires immediate medevac. Copy that. Hold up. Fuel's a little low. Let's get Angel Rescue 1 to take it. Uh, control, what is Angel Rescue 1's 20? Fifteen minutes out. Oh, we're closer. We'll be fine. That doesn't matter. Let's... Let's just... Let's land and take care of the copter. We'll be fine.

He's a family man. And you know what? I screw it up. And you know why? Because I am jonesing. I am jonesing for that high just like your sorry ass, and you know what? You have absolutely ruined me. So get it together, okay? Just man up... There he is. Hey, you got a save, didn't you? Talk to me. You got a save. And you're still not done? Are you gonna bust my balls? Are you... You still going? No. Dude, curse is over. You did good, man. You did good, dude. Whatever. Hey. Look, dude. Now, the reason I've been giving you all this crap all day, I've been riding you so hard, is because it reminds me of... It reminds me of my probie kill. Yes. You had... Yes, I did, all right? And the curse went on a lot longer than yours did. Trust me. I was living in Boston. Always cold in Boston. I don't know what the deal with Boston is. Hated the Celtics, loved the city, so you understand my dilemma. Um... Babe? Oh, it's been a long day. I want a bath. Are you around? Where are you? You know what, Rabbit? I get it. I really do. You screwed up everything else in your life, and I... And I guess that I am next. I'm not gonna try and stop you, Rabbit, you know? It's your decision. You either pull yourself out of that deep, dank hole that you have willfully descended into, or you just stay there, 'cause I am sure as hell not getting dragged down there with you. I can't. It's your call. In or out. What is it gonna be? Come on. Don't do this. What? Is it this important to you? Really, this isn't necessary. Oh, no, but you're here. It's too late now. Now let me give you a little bit of the lay of the land, all right? The blond chick talking to Tony at the bar? Yeah. Yeah. Vodka makes her horny. Man, woman... I speak from experience. With her? Well, she tried. You're bad. The redheaded chick right there... Checking you out, waving at you? Yeah. Yeah. Who is that? Yeah, um, don't get her any margaritas. Tequila makes her belligerent. Yeah? Yeah. And, uh, her friend there, that chick beside her? If you get a lot of rum in her, she'll give you a lap dance to remember. If you get the right song on the jukebox. Yeah? Lots of things at play there. Wait, what song? So, uh... I don't know. Depends on her mood. And how much rum you give her. Now go forth and conquer. You don't get it, do you? What? They're not why I'm here. Let's go get a beer. And a lap dance. I'm ready.
