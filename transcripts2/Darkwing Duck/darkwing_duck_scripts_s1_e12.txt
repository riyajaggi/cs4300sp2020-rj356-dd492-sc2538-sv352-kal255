 Darkwing Duck (1991–1992): Season 1, Episode 12 - Easy Comes, Easy Grows - full transcript 
 Hoping to keep his money safe from the vault-snatcher hitting the banks, Herb Muddlefoot buries his bills beneath his yard. However, contrary to popular belief, the money DOES begin to grow a money tree, of which Gosalyn and Honker quickly take advantage of. When Drake "Darkwing Duck" Mallard discovers this, he's quick to accept the trendy money-grubbing lifestyle. That is, until he's arrested for counterfeiting, as the bills were all grown with the same serial number and the tree has withered. Now it's up to Gosalyn, Launchpad and Honker to free DW and figure out where the grown greenbacks are literally running to.
