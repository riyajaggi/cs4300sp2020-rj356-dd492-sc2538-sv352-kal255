 Darkwing Duck (1991–1992): Season 1, Episode 6 - Apes of Wrath - full transcript 
 When Dr. Beatrice Bruté vanishes into the jungle, S.H.U.S.H sends Darkwing Duck and crew to find and bring her back. What they find instead is a group of temperamental gorillas, as well as the trigger-happy Major Trenchrot, who owns what seems to be a banana plantation. When he claims the apes stole both his bananas and Dr. Bruté, D.W. and Launchpad plan a stakeout. Meanwhile, Gosalyn conducts her own investigation of Trenchrot's storehouse, but is inadvertently taken by the gorillas into the jungle. Giving chase, Darkwing and Launchpad may find more answers (and troubles) than they bargained for.

YOU MEAN YOU DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND THE MISSING APE LADY? I WON'T BE ABLE TO SHUT THIS STUBBORN SUITCASE. AND, FOR YOUR INFORMATION, DR. BRUTAY IS NOT AN APE LADY. SHE'S A FAMED ANTHROPOLOGIST. EMPLOYED BY SHUSH. WHICH IS WHY SHUSH CALLED DARKWING DUCK IN ON THE CASE. NEVER FEAR. I'LL- BRING-THEM-BACK-ALIVE GOSALYN'S HERE. SORRY, GOSALYN. YOU'RE NOT GOING. WHAT? UH! I SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING. NO FAIR. I KNOW THE MOST ABOUT JUNGLE LEACHES. YOU ARE NOT GOING. THAT'S FINALE, END OF DISCUSSION. OHH! IF YOU THINK THAT WILL CHANGE MY MIND, YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN. I AM UNSHAKEN, UNMOVED, AND-- UNBELIEVABLE. THIS PLACE IS TOTALLY TARZAN. [TARZAN YELL] IT'S A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD. NOT TOUGH ENOUGH FOR ME. SHUSH MADE SURE WE HAVE THE LATEST JUNGLE SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT. THIS MAY LOOK LIKE AN ORDINARY COCONUT, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A CLEVERLY DISGUISED BOMB. TO EXPLODE IT, JUST... TWIST THE TOP. OOPS. HERE. PUSH THAT BUTTON, AND I'LL TOSS IT OUT. THIS ONE? NO. AAH! GUESS I SHOULD'VE BUCKLED UP. AHH! AAH! AT LEAST, IT WAS A SAFE LANDING. UM, PERHAPS I SPOKE TOO SOON. AAH! OUCH. AND DOUBLE OUCH. HEY, ARE YOU OK, DAD? PEACHY. WHERE'D YOU PARK THE PLANE? RIGHT OVER--UH-OH! THEY'RE HURTING MY BABY. THE NATIVES ARE GETTING RESTLESS. WAY COOL. GOSALYN, GET BACK HERE. IT'S BETTER THAN ZOOS. GET DOWN HERE. [TARZAN YELL] WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MAKE SUDDEN MOVES. EAT THAT, AND YOU'RE DEAD MEAT. HERE'S A NEW WORD FOR YOU, GOSALYN. IT'S CALLED DIPLOMACY. LEARN IT. YOU SHOULD KNOCK THAT OFF. [ROAR] THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. IT ISN'T EVEN CLOSE. AAH! HELP! I'M ABOUT TO BECOME TWINS. AAH! UH-OH. EW! MONKEY HAIRS. THERE'S WRITING IN HERE. "DR. BEATRICE BRUTAY, FAMED ANTHRO-- ANTHRO-POL-O-GIST." WHAT? DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS? I CAN'T KEEP IT. WE FOUND DR. BRUTAY'S SAFARI HAT. WE'LL FIND THE REST OF HER. IF THERE IS A REST OF HER. [CHATTERING] I'LL BET THOSE APES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DR. BRUTAY'S DISAPPEARANCE. OR THEY'RE HOT FOR HATS. [GUNSHOTS] HIT THE DIRT! BLASTED! THOSE MONKEYS HAVE ELUDED US AGAIN. WHO YOU CALLING A MONKEY? I'M DARKWING DUCK. DARKWING DUCK, EH? MMM. PROVE IT! CERTAINLY. WATCH THIS. HYAH! HOO DOO HEY! HYAH! OOH HOO HOO! UH-OH. NOT ANOTHER COCONUT. HMM. I SAY... THAT'S DARKWING DUCK, ALL RIGHT. SO, MAJOR TRENCHROT, YOU KNEW DR. BRUTAY? LIKE A SISTER. I WAS SO FOND OF HER I WAS PLANNING TO MAKE HER A PARTNER IN MY BANANA PLANTATION, BUT ONE DAY WHILST I WAS DONATING FREE BANANAS TO THOSE UNGRATEFUL APES, THEY KIDNAPPED HER. THAT'S THE LAST ANYONE'S SEEN OF HER. HEY, MAJOR! WHAT'S IN HERE? NOTHING. UH, I MEAN SOMETHING, BUT YOU CAN'T GO IN. WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE PEEL BANANAS AND SOME ARE BASHFUL. AND BESIDES, WE'VE GOT TO FIND THOSE GORILLAS BEFORE DR. BRUTAY'S HISTORY. THEY'LL FIND YOU. THOSE HORRID GORILLAS ATTACK MY PLANTATION EVERY NIGHT. PERFECT! NIGHT IS MY FAVORITE TIME OF DAY. HOW DID YOU GET GOSALYN TO GO TO BED SO EASILY? THE SECRET OF GOOD PARENTING IS LETTING YOUR CHILD KNOW WHO'S BOSS. OFFERING MONEY NEVER HURT. ARGH! OH! UH! ALL I NEED ARE SOME BANANAS FOR BAIT, AND I'LL HAVE THE PERFECT GORILLA TRAP. UH-OH. OHH! I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM HERE! OH, YOU MEAN FROM HERE. I THOUGHT YOU MEANT ANOTHER HERE. I'LL TEACH YOU TO DISOBEY. COULD BE GORILLAS. WHOA! OR VERY LARGE TERMITES. GOSALYN? TRENCHROT? I DIDN'T DO IT. WELL, OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T. THEN JUST WHAT WERE YOU DOING? TRYING TO CATCH GORILLAS? SHE WAS TRYING TO CATCH GOR-- WHOA! YAY! WAY! OH! OH! YOUR TRAP WORKED, BUT D.W. ISN'T A GORILLA. GOSALYN! I'M SUPPOSED TO BE IN BED. THE AUDACIOUS AVENGER, MINDFUL OF MENACING MISDOERS, KEEPS HIS SENSES TUNED TO THE NIGHT'S SILENCE. [GUNSHOTS] GORILLAS. AH, DARKWING. JUST IN TIME. THOSE MANIACAL MONKEYS ARE STEALING OUR BANANAS! WHY WOULD THEY STEAL? YOU GIVE BANANAS AWAY. BECAUSE THEY'RE ROTTEN. THEY'LL TAKE ANYTHING THAT'S NOT NAILED DOWN. HOLD IT, TRENCHROT. THEY'VE GOT GOSALYN. NO! WATCH OUT FOR MY... WHOA! YEAH! HEY! GORILLA TRAP. OK. THEY'VE KIDNAPPED GOSALYN, AND THEY'VE KIDNAPPED DR. BRUTAY. BUT WE'LL FIND THOSE TREETOP TERRORISTS. NO ONE MESSES WITH DARKWING DUCK AND GETS AWAY WITH IT. UH, D.W., THERE'S SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO KNOW. WHAT'S THAT, LAUNCHPAD? LAUNCHPAD? BUDDY? AHEM. DESPITE THE DISCONCERTING DISAPPEARANCES, THE UNDAUNTED DO-GOODER DEMONSTRATES DARING BY... DUCKING! HEE HEE. GULP. UH, BANANA, ANYONE? OH, BOY. WE MAY HAVE TO FIGHT OUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE. AU CONTRAIRE, MON FRERE, IN A TIME OF CRISIS, ONE MUST REMAIN COOL, CALM, AND UNFLAPPABLY CIVIL. OK, YOU BIG BABOON, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. WHERE'S GOSALYN? I DON'T PRACTICE WHAT I PREACH. PARENTS CAN DO THAT. [ROAR] I THINK HE'S CHALLENGING YOU. THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE ON WRESTLING FOR DOLLARS. THEN, CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. SHAPOOTAHOING! WOOTA HY! WHOO-HEY! WHO-WAYBAH. WAH-HA! IMPRESSED? [WHAM] [WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM] I GUESS THAT'S A NO. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED, USE YOUR HEAD! AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, USE SOMETHING BIGGER. EXCUSE ME. TOODLES. AT LEAST THIS TIME, I DIDN'T GET CLOBBERED WITH COCONUTS. AHH, DARKWING DUCK, I PRESUME. HOW DELIGHTFUL. YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR TEA. OOH, WITH A SLICE OF BANANA, JUST HOW I LIKE IT. ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. I'M DR. BEATRICE BRUTAY. NICE OUTFIT. WELL, WHEN IN ROME, DO AS THE ROMANS. WHEN IN THE JUNGLE, GO APE. OOH! CARE TO TRY IT? DARKWING DUCK ACT LIKE A MONKEY? SORRY. NO WAY. ABSOLUTELY. POSITIVELY NOT. [GRRR] OF COURSE, ON SECOND THOUGHT... HOW DID THAT GO AGAIN? OOH OOH HEE. SOMETHING LIKE THAT? HEY, ABOUT TIME YOU GOT HERE. IS THIS WILD OR WHAT? I'LL OPT FOR OR WHAT. NOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE, WHAT SAY WE HAVE A LITTLE CELEBRATION? BONGO, CONGO, PREPARE THE PRIMATE PUNCH. PRIMATE PUNCH? A MIXTURE OF FRESH TROPICAL FRUIT JUICES.

THOSE APES ARE CRIMINALS. THEY STOLE TRENCHROT'S BANANAS. BANANAS? OOH OOH. AHH HA HA. OOH OOH OOH. AH AH AH AH! LOOKS LIKE MAJOR TRENCHROT CERTAINLY PULLED THE BANANA PEEL OVER YOUR EYES, YOUNG MAN. DO THESE LOOK LIKE BANANAS? HOLY GUACAMOLE. KEEN GEAR. YIPES. YOU SEE? TRENCHROT IS STOCKPILING WEAPONS, NOT BANANAS. HE WANTS TO TURN THIS ISLAND INTO A PLAYGROUND. IT'S GOOD FOR A JUNGLE GYM. NOT THAT KIND. TRENCHROT'S PLANNING A VACATION VILLA FOR VILLAINS. HMM. A HOTEL FOR HIT MEN. I SUPPOSE THESE WEAPONS ARE FOR ELIMINATING OPPOSITION, RIGHT? THEY'RE DOOR PRIZES FOR HIS FIRST 100 GUESTS. BEFORE I CONTACTED SHUSH, I GOT CAUGHT SNOOPING. I'D STILL BE A PRISONER AT THAT PHONY PLANTATION IF BONGO HADN'T RESCUED ME. LOOKS LIKE TRENCHROT'S MADE A REAL MONKEY OUT OF ME. HEH HEH! JUST AS I HAD HOPED. HE'S LED US TO THE GORILLAS' CAMP. NOW, LET'S SIC 'EM, BOYS. HA HA HA! AAH! AAH! AAH! YOU CAN'T SCARE ME.

THEY MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED NOW, BUT IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL THEY RUN OUT OF PLACES TO HIDE. HA HA HA! HA HA HA! OHH! OH! IT LOOKS LIKE EVIL HAS TRIUMPHED ONCE AGAIN. NONSENSE. IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER. MAYBE WE ARE HOPELESSLY OUTNUMBERED, OUTWEAPONED, AND OUTEVERYTHINGED. THAT'S NO REASON TO GIVE UP. YOU'VE GOT A PLAN? NO! BUT I'M WORKING ON ONE. HMM. NOW LET'S SEE. YES! YES! THAT'S IT! NAH! TOO PEDESTRIAN. OHH, YES! N-N-NAH! PRIMATE PUNCH? NO, THANKS. BLOWING UP IRRITATES MY STOMACH. LAUNCHPAD, YOU'RE A GENIUS! WHAT AN IDEA! THANKS, D.W. UH, SO WHAT'S MY IDEA? WHAT AN IDEA! SOON COMMON CRIMINALS WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE THE LIFE OF LUXURY, VACATIONING FIVE DAYS AND SIX GLORIOUS NIGHTS AT TRENCHROT'S FINE SPA AND RABBLE-ROUSERS' RETREAT. AIRFARE NOT INCLUDED.
