 Darkwing Duck (1991–1992): Season 1, Episode 8 - Duck Blind - full transcript 
 When Darkwing Duck faces off against the electrically-charged and insane Megavolt, he is subjected to the blinding flash of supercharged light bulbs, leaving him unable to see. Dismissing Gosalyn's suggestions of setting the hero business aside, Darkwing tries many different methods of overcoming his new handicap, from a radio link with Launchpad to a thermo-audio sensor. However, nothing works, and he soon gives up on crime fighting, as well as life in general. Eventually, it's up to Gosalyn, Launchpad and Honker to try and re-inspire Darking to tackle Megavolt one last time. Even if they succeed, can he hope to defeat the villain while still blind?

PLEASE. I KNOW YOU. YOU'RE THE DARKWING DUCK FAN CLUB. YES. IN FACT, WE'RE HAVING A MEMBERSHIP DRIVE. TOLD YOU HE'D COME. NOW WE CAN FRY TOGETHER. GIVE IT UP, DUCK. I GOT THE WEAPONS, THE HOME ADVANTAGE, AND YOU CAN'T SEE! YOU LOST YOUR SENSES? ONE. I'VE GOT OTHERS. JUDGING BY THE HEAT, I'M UNDER A LIGHT. OBSERVANT, FOR A BLIND DUCK. THANKS EVER SO. I KNOW WHY YOU'RE CALLED DARKWING. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE DARK. I'M SO HURT. HYAH! THAT OUGHT TO EVEN THINGS. NICE TRY, BUT I'M TIRED OF YOU BUSTING MY BULBS.
