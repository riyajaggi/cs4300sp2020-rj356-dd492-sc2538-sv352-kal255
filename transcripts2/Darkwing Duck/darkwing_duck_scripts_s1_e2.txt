YOU'VE GOT TO WORK ON YOUR NARRATION. THEY WRITE BETTER STUFF ON SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS. OH, YEAH? HOW'S THIS? QUICKLY, DARKWING DUCK TURNS THE TABLES ON THE TINY TERROR. THOUGH SHE'S TICKLING-- WILL YOU STOP THAT? THAT'S NO FAIR--TICKLING. A RADIO. LET'S HAVE SOME TUNES. YEOW! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TURNING ON THE RADIO? THAT'S NOT A RADIO. THIS IS SOME KIND OF TRAINING COURSE, HUH? YOU MIGHT SAY. LET ME TRY. NO. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. THAT WAS AMAZING. IT'S NOT AT MY LEVEL, BUT THAT'S STILL PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. DARN. FORGOT THE MILK. OHH! OH, ALLOW ME. YOU OUGHT TO BE MORE CAREFUL. SOUNDS REASONABLE. THIS WAS STASHED IN THE CLOSET. WHY NOT WEAR IT WHEN YOU RIDE YOUR BIKE? BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK DRAMATIC. SCRAMBLED BRAINS DON'T. YOU NEED SEAT BELTS. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN, BUT I KNEW THIS JOB WAS DANGEROUS. WHY WEAR A MASK? BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING SO TERRIFYING TO THE CRIMINAL MIND AS THE UNKNOWN. I AM THE THING GOING THUMP IN THE NIGHT. I'M THE NEUROSIS THAT REQUIRES THERAPY. YOU DON'T REMOVE YOUR MASK FOR ANYONE? THAT'S RIGHT. NOT NO ONE. NOT NEVER. WHAT ABOUT A REALLY CLOSE FRIEND? WELL, UH, MAYBE, UH... SOMEDAY. HEY, IT'S A START. IF I USE YOUR BED, WHERE WILL YOU SLEEP? I WON'T. I'M A NIGHT PERSON. TAURUS BULBA'S LOOSE. I'M EXTRAVIGILANT. WHAT DOES HE WANT? BULBA STOLE YOUR GRANDFATHER'S INVENTION. HE THINKS YOU KNOW THE CODE THAT OPERATES IT. WHAT IS A WADDLEMEYER RAMROD ANYWAY? A DEVICE DISRUPTING GRAVITATIONAL BONDS ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL ALLOWING MANIPULATION ON A MACROSCALE. IT MAKES THINGS FLOAT AND STUFF. HERE'S A PICTURE. THAT'S GRANDPA. LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE REALLY CLOSE. WE WERE, BUT HE NEVER TOLD ME CODES. UNFORTUNATELY, TAURUS BULBA DOESN'T KNOW THAT. HIS MEN WILL SEARCH FOR YOU. IF THEY KNEW HOW MUCH SPIRIT YOU HAVE, THEY'D RUN. SPIRIT? THANKS, DARKWING. UH, WELL, SURE. GOOD NIGHT, GOSALYN. I CAN'T SLEEP. YOU JUST NEED SOMETHING TO RELAX YOU. I HAVE A MALLET. GRANDPA SANG A LULLABY. OH, WELL, THAT'S--I DON'T REALLY DO LULLABIES. TEACH ME ONE OF HIS. I'LL SING IT. THIS HAS THE SUSPICIOUS RING OF REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY, BUT YOU WIN.

YELLOW, BLUE, RED-- THE LYRICS MATCH THE RAMROD'S CONTROLS. SHE'S HAD THE ARMING CODE AND NEVER KNEW IT. FOR HER, IT BETTER STAY THAT WAY. LIGHTNING WITHOUT THUNDER? HMM. THE PATTERN'S TOO REGULAR FOR LIGHTNING. EXCELLENT. A HALF HOUR OF THIS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT. YES, TAURUS BULBA. IT'S A MATTER OF KNOWING YOUR ADVERSARY. SOMEWHERE DOWN THERE IS THIS DARKWING DUCK. I'VE WATCHED HIM. I KNOW HIS WEAKNESS. THAT'S MORSE CODE OUT THERE. TAURUS BULBA, THE CRIMINAL GENIUS, RECOGNIZING THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS, IS OFFERING TO SURRENDER HIMSELF, BUT ONLY TO DARKWING DUCK. ONCE TANTALUS PINPOINTS HIS HIDEOUT, YOU GRAB THE GIRL. WHAT IF HE DOESN'T KNOW MORSE CODE? THAT DO-GOODER PROBABLY SLEEPS WITH A BOY SCOUT HANDBOOK UNDER HIS PILLOW. I'M GLAD I SAVED THIS. WE'VE GOT DOTS AND DASHES. [MUMBLING] TO SURRENDER ONLY TO DARKWING DUCK. YES. IT'S HEADLINE CITY. WHAT'S UP? WIN THE LOTTERY? DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU. MY REPUTATION HAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY GUTTER WHERE CRIMINALS GATHER. THEY COME TO ME, GROVELING AT MY DOORSTEP, PLEADING TO BE JAILED. I SENSE A MOVIE. BUT THAT'S ILLOGICAL. HE JUST ESCAPED. IT IS OBVIOUS HE'S HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS ME WITH HIS CREW. YEAH, RIGHT, BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU SAID TAURUS BULBA WAS A CRIMINAL GENIUS. WHY WOULD HE SURRENDER TO YOU? HE KNOWS HE'S OUTMATCHED. I HAVE HIS MEN RUNNING. I REMEMBER WE DID THE RUNNING. YOU THINK IT WAS LUCK? I DIDN'T SAY-- JUST A COINCIDENCE YOU'RE HERE WITH ME, INSTEAD OF WITH HIM? I'M JUST A COSTUMED CLOWN. WHO'LL TAKE DARKWING DIP SERIOUSLY? NEVER MIND. IT DOESN'T MATTER. AFTER TAURUS BULBA'S IN JAIL, YOU'LL RETURN TO THE ORPHANAGE. WE'LL CONTINUE LIVING. THE BAY BRIDGE! SHE'S IN THE TOWER. GRAB HER. I'LL GO KEEP DARKWING DUCK OCCUPIED. I AM THE TERROR THAT FLAPS IN THE NIGHT! I AM THE JAILER WHO THROWS AWAY THE KEY. I AM-- FEELING REALLY STUPID. I HATE BEING EARLY.
