 ♪ DARKWING DUCK ♪ ♪ YOU BETTER WATCH OUT, YOU BETTER CALL ♪ ♪ DARKWING DUCK ♪♪ I HOPE THAT DARKWING DUCK RECEIVED OUR SIGNAL. I'M SURE HIS LOGIC AND DEDUCTION WILL SOLVE THIS CASE. BUT HE IS NOT AN AGENT OF SHUSH. HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR PROPER PROCEDURES. HE IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE! PRECISELY WHY THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT FEARS ME. I'M THE TERROR THAT FLAPS IN THE NIGHT, THE COMBINATION LOCK ON THE VAULTS OF JUSTICE. I AM DARKWING DUCK! [COUGHING] THANK YOU FOR COMING, DARKWING. WE'VE A SPOT OF TROUBLE HERE. ANOTHER BANK HAS BEEN CLEANED OUT, AND I MEAN CLEANED. DISORDERLY MINDS, LIKE YOURS, DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF CLEANLINESS. J. GANDER LIKES MY DISORDERLY MIND. HAS YOUR BY-THE-BOOK BRAIN GONE BLANK AGAIN? GRRR! URRRR! GENTLEMEN! SOME FIEND HAS SUCCEEDED IN RUBBING OUT THE NATION'S ENTIRE ECONOMY. THIS PAPER WAS ONCE WORTH $10,000. NOW WITHOUT THE INK IT'S WORTHLESS. WITHOUT PRINTED MONEY THE ECONOMY WILL SELF-DESTRUCT. THE COUNTRY WILL BE PLUCKED! AS CHIEF AGENT GRYZLIKOFF HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN HIS INVESTIGATIONS, IT'S TIME TO EMPLOY YOUR METHODS. TIRED OF COUNTING ON A PREDICTABLE PAPER-PUSHER. I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. NO PROBLEM. I'LL GET ON IT. DARKWING DUCK IS ON THE JOB. YOU'RE TAKING CHANCES TEASING OLD GRYZLI. HE PICKS HIS TEETH WITH A CROWBAR. FORGET THAT BONE-HEADED BRUIN. GRYZLIKOFF CAN'T SEE PAST THE MANUAL'S FINE PRINT. I'LL ALWAYS BE TOP DUCK IN J. GANDER'S BOOK, AND THAT'S THE ONLY BOOK THAT COUNTS. GRRRRR! AGENT GRYZLIKOFF HAVE YOU SEEN MY BRIEFCASE? HMM... CLEANING CREW COMING THROUGH! PLEASE! I HAVE URGENT MATTERS TO ATTEND TO. IT'S OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE! GO AHEAD. I'LL BE THROUGH IN A JIFFY. YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW I'M HERE! MADAME, THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH! YOU WILL LEAVE IMMEDIATELY! JUST AS SOON AS I TAKE OUT THE TRASH. WA-WA-WAIT! TURN IT OFF! [COUGHING] LET ME OUT! YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS! DO YOU HAVE A PROGRESS REPORT ON YOUR MISSION? SURE DO! IT'S IN THE BAG. HA HA HA HA HA HA! WITH SHUSH OFF MY TAIL, THE SCRUBBED MONEY WILL SEND THE BANKS DOWN THE DRAIN. OUR ECONOMIC EXPERTS WILL MOVE IN TO MOP UP. I COULDN'T PUT IT BETTER MYSELF. PINE OUT. YOU'LL HEAR FROM OFFICIAL-- KEEP IT DOWN, WINDFALL! ♪ I GOT SOME HEFTY DUTY SCRUBBIN' ♪ ♪ TO DO ♪♪ HA HA HA! I AM THE BUG CRAWLING UP YOUR TROUSER LEG. I DON'T NEED AN APPOINTMENT. I AM DARKWING DUCK! [COUGHING] SORRY ABOUT THE SMOKE. AGAIN YOU IGNORE PROCEDURES BY FAVORING CHEAP THEATRICS. IT'S WHAT I DO BEST. FUZZY, SHOULD YOU BE SITTING IN J. GANDER'S DESK? DOES YOUR RULE BOOK ALLOW THAT? FOR THE MOMENT IT IS MY DESK! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? DIRECTOR HOOTER HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED. WASTEBASKET'S SPARKLING... DESK COMPLETELY DUST-FREE... MICROSCOPIC SCUFF MARKS INDICATE THE USE OF A VACUUM APPARATUS... HOOTER HAS BEEN HOOVERED, OBVIOUSLY BY THE MONEY-LAUNDERING VILLAIN! I'LL GET ON IT! NO! THERE'LL BE NO DARKWING DISASTER CHASING WILD HUNCHES THIS TIME. J. GANDER PUT ME ON THE CASE HIMSELF. AN OVERSIGHT. THE SHUSH MANUAL STATES NO CIVILIAN CAN BE USED AS AN AGENT UNLESS HE PASSES A PROFICIENCY TEST. IF YOU WORK ON THIS CASE, YOU'LL GO BY THE BOOK. AND THAT'S THE ONLY BOOK THAT COUNTS. THIS LOOKS BAD, D.W. NO PICTURES. I DON'T NEED IT. NO BOOK MATCHES MY EXPERIENCE. PERHAPS WE SHOULD BEGIN. THE OBJECT--YOU HAVE TO REACH THE OTHER SIDE... ALIVE. HA! CHILD'S PLAY! THIS ISN'T HALF AS DANGEROUS AS VISITING MY BARBER. THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO, GRYZLIKOFF? [LOW VOICE] I GUESS NOT. HE WANTS TO PLAY NASTY, EH? I'LL SHOW HIM I AM TOUGH. THE NEXT TASK IS THE UNDERWATER ENDURANCE TEST. RETRIEVE THE MICROFILM FROM THE POOL. WITH MY KNOWLEDGE OF MICRONESIAN BREATH CONTROL-- NO PROBLEM. [TAKING DEEP BREATHS] [GROOGGLE GROOGGLE] [GROOGGLE GROOGGLE] AAH! BACK! I'LL MAKE SHOES OUT OF YOU! [GASPS] THAT WAS CLOSE. HEY! CLOSER THAN YOU KNOW! [ERRR ERRR] OW! YOU'VE DONE BETTER THAN EXPECTORATED. YOUR FINAL TEST IS SIMPLE. REALLY? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, POLE VAULT A SKYSCRAPER, PLAY KAZOO WITH THE PHILHARMONIC? JUST SURVIVE. GOOD LUCK, D.W.! SO, WHEN DOES THE TEST BEGIN? HUH, PERHAPS I AM BEING TOO SOFT. [BOOM] DARKWING DUCK EMERGES ONCE AGAIN-- SINGED, BUT TRIUMPHANT. SINGED, BUT TRI-- SINGED BUT-- SIN-- UH-OH. I...BETTER GET A DUST PAN. GRYZLIKOFF DIDN'T THINK I COULD QUALIFY AS AN AGENT. HIS LITTLE TEST WOULDN'T STOP ME. HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT DARKWING DUCK IS MADE OF IRON, IMPERVIOUS TO PAIN. THAT'S THE OLD-- AAH! THAT HURT! DON'T DO THAT! I MEAN, LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THE MANUAL SAYS WE'RE SUPPOSE TO USE A D11-6 DESTINATION DISCLOSURE FORM. HOW HARD CAN A SIMPLE LITTLE FORM BE? THIS IS WORSE THAN THE OBSTACLE COURSE. UNBELIEVABLE! THOSE ARE JUST THE FORMS FOR PERMISSION TO FILL OUT THESE FORMS. SLEEPING ON SHUSH TIME? NO! READING THE FINE PRINT. BECAUSE YOU PASSED, I'M FORCED TO ASSIGN YOU TO THE MISSION. IT'S ABOUT TIME! LET'S GET DANGEROUS! THERE WILL BE NO GETTING DANGEROUS! FOLLOW ORDERS OR YOU'RE FIRED. FINE. WE'LL TRY IT YOUR WAY. [GASPS] THERE'S MORE DANGER IN A DAY-CARE CENTER. THIS THING STINKS. THIS IS A DIAPER TRUCK. I SHOULD BE RUNNING THIS OPERATION, NOT WASTING TIME BABYSITTING BANKS. I FIND IT KIND OF RELAXING. TIME TO REMOVE ♪ A LITTLE RING AROUND THE DOLLAR ♪♪ OF COURSE! I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. IT'S AMMONIA PINE. WHO? SHE WAS A CLEANING LADY AT A RESEARCH LAB UNTIL AN ACCIDENT WITH A DISINFECTANT TWISTED HER INTO MRS. HYDE OF THE CLEANING WORLD. NOW SHE SCRUBS FOR F.O.W.L. LET'S MOVE! THE MANUAL SAYS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO CALL HEADQUARTERS FIRST. AND SPEND THE NIGHT FILLING FORMS? THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO RESCUE J. GANDER! IT'S TIME TO PUT AMMONIA THROUGH THE RINSE CYCLE. WHOOPS. DARKWING DUCK! ONE MORE STUBBORN STAIN TO WIPE OUT! EAT SOAP, HERO! [GAGGING] OH, YEAH? WELL, SUCK GAS, EVIL-DOER! HA HA HA! NOW, THERE'S AN IMPRESSIVE WEAPON. AHH, WELL, TIME TO TURN IN. [SNORING] LET ME SHOW YOU SOME REAL FIRE POWER. HA HA HA! WELL, THAT PROVES HOT AIR RISES. COME ON! RISE AND SHINE! WHAT ARE WE DOING UP HERE? WE'RE TRAPPED! LET'S HOPE WE DON'T POP UNTIL WE REACH THE RIVER. NO PROBLEMO. THIS BABY'S PLENTY STRONG. WHOOPS. AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! GRAB ON, LAUNCHPAD! WE'RE TOO HEAVY! I'LL TRY TO STEER FOR THE RIVER! [RIPPING] [GULP] [BOING] [SPROING] WHOA OH OH OH OH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! THAT WASN'T SO BAD. NOTHING LIKE A STEEL BELTED RADIAL TO STOP. [SQUEAKING] UH-- NOT ONE WORD. GET ME OUT! [SQUEAKING] MAYBE WE SHOULD GET THE OPINION OF A CHIROPRACTOR. [SQUEAKING] OR AT LEAST A PLUMBER. [SCREECH] WHAT KIND OF BUBBLE-BRAIN AGENTS DO YOU HAVE? I COULD SCRUB YOU OUT LIKE A BATHTUB RING. THEY HAVE ORDERS TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO BRING YOU TO JUSTICE. IF I CAN'T USE YOU AS A HOSTAGE, YOU'RE ONE MORE STAIN TO BE WIPED OUT. YOU'RE QUITE MAD, YOU KNOW. MAYBE... BUT I'M TIDY. HA HA HA HA HA! IF NOT FOR YOU, DIRECTOR HOOTER WOULD BE SAFE AND AMMONIA PINE WOULD BE UNDER ARREST! YOU WILL LOOK AT ME WHEN I AM SPEAKING. YOU-- THERE WASN'T TIME! BESIDES, I'M USED TO WORKING ALONE, NOT WITH SHUSH GORILLAS. THEN IT WILL NO LONGER BE A PROBLEM. FINALLY. I'M EXTERMINATING YOUR PRESENT AND FUTURE ASSOCIATION WITH SHUSH. IF YOU INTERFERE, YOU WILL BE SENT TO PRISON! HAVE A NICE DAY. LIKE IT HURTS BEING KICKED OUT OF SHUSH. HELPING THEM WAS A PAIN. BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN GET A GOING-AWAY PARTY. IF J. GANDER WASN'T IN DANGER, I'D WALK AWAY FROM THE MESS. IF ONLY I KNEW WHERE TO START. THERE'S A BILL ON YOUR BILL. IT'S MONEY! THE INK FROM MONEY. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? THE CITY DUMP AFTER OUR CRASH LANDING! THEY SHOULD KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. NOW, LET'S GET DANGEROUS. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, THIS IS AMMONIA'S HIDEOUT. CONGRATULATIONS, PINE. NOW THAT YOU'RE FINISHED CLEANING OUT THAT SECTOR, WE'LL BEGIN TAKING CONTROL OF THE BANKS. THANKS, HIGH COMMAND. BUT WHAT ABOUT OLD SOURPUSS HOOTER? HE'S ENTIRELY AT YOUR DISPOSAL FOR DISPOSAL. CONSIDER IT A PERK. THIS MUD-WRINGER USED TO BE ON THE ROOF-- A SYMBOL OF CLEANLINESS TO INSPIRE THE CITY. THEY JUNKED IT TO MODERNIZE THE FACTORY. I SAVED IT, EVEN MADE IT WORK. IT'S JUST THE THING TO SQUEEZE OUT UNWANTED SLUDGE. ERRR HUH ERR! JUST RELAX AND ENJOY THE SHOW. IT'S... WASH TIME! ALL RIGHT, LAUNCHPAD! TIME FOR DARKWING DUCK NERVE-WRACKING ENTRANCE! SMOKE BOMB READY? IT'S A CHECK AND DOUBLE-CHECK. THEN LET'S GET DANGEROU-- I WARNED YOU NOT TO INTERFERE. NOW YOU ARE GOING TO PRISON. THERE'S NO TIME FOR NONSENSE-- A GOOD AGENT ALWAYS HAS TIME TO DO IT BY THE BOOK. [MUMBLING] J. GANDER'S DOWN THERE, YOU DOPE. IF THIS IS ONE OF YOUR TRICKS-- AAH! [RANTING] [MUMBLING] NICE OF YOU TO DROP IN. [MUMBLING] I'M SORRY. SORRY, GENTS. MY WORKS DONE HERE. THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO DO-- EXCEPT MOP UP! HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA! I GOT TO GO! GIVE ME A WRING SOMETIME. I AM THE TERROR THAT FLAPS IN THE NIGHT. I AM THE PIN THAT BURSTS YOUR BUBBLE. I AM DARKWING DUCK! THIS TIME WE'RE READY FOR YOUR SINISTER SUDS. OOOH, I'D REALLY BE STUMPED IF I WAS GOING TO SOAP YOU. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A CHANCE TO USE MY NEW TOY! SUCK AIR, DUST BUNNIES! HA HA HA HA HA! WHOAOOOAOO! OH! OH! OHO! OH! THIS IS LIKE MY FIRST FLIGHT-- ALL MY FLIGHTS. OOOP! THE SHUSH MANUAL CAN'T HELP NOW! FOR ONCE IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF HELP. THE AIRS GOT NOWHERE TO GO! I GOT TO PULL THE PLUG! [BLAM] WHAT? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? EVERYTHING IS SO--SO.... DIRTY! YEAH. AND I NEVER PICK UP MY BEDROOM, EITHER. YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS, DIRTWING. YOU GET J. GANDER. I'LL HANDLE PINE. [CLICK CLICK CLICK] SCUM LIKE YOU WON'T STAIN MY RECORD. FACE IT, AMMONIA. I'M SCRUBBING YOUR MISSION. NOT SO FAST! YOU'RE PLAYING IN MY BUCKET. HAH! WHOOPS. EN GARDE! HAVE YOU OUT OF THERE IN A SEC. MMMM! YOU'RE ALL WASHED UP, PINE! YOUR DOLLAR DUSTING'S DONE. DON'T COUNT YOUR BUBBLES BEFORE THEY'RE POPPED. HA HA HA HA! [POP] I'LL BE SEEING YOU, DUCKS! [POP] NO! AAH! UUHAAH! WAAH! YOIYEYOIOI! AAH... EEEEEEEE... I WASHED UP THIS TIME. I'LL BE BACK TO SHINE AGAIN! THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY IS IN YOUR DEBT. ONCE AGAIN YOUR UNPREDICTABLE METHODS SAVED US. NO... THIS TIME WE DID IT BY THE BOOK.
