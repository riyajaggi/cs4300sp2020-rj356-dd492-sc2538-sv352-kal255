 Darkwing Duck (1991–1992): Season 1, Episode 17 - Bearskin Thug - full transcript 
 It's spring once again, and for Gosalyn, that means one horrifying thing: camping season! Dragged along for the ride, Gosalyn and the "true outdoors-man", Drake "Darkwing Duck" Mallard head for the forest, undeterred even by the bear sightings in the area. Not only does DW have to show Gosalyn the joys of natural living, he has to do so between the terrorism of a ferocious bear, the modern meddling of the Muddlefoots, and another of Steelbeak's evil plots.

THE BENEFITS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION CAN BE BREATHTAKING. HERE'S THE SPORTS. WANT THE TRAVEL SECTION? GET A LIFE. IF IT ISN'T IN COMICS OR SPORTS, MY BRAIN REJECTS IT. AAH! OH, NO! UH, YOUR TEAM LOSE? WORSE! WHERE CAN I HIDE? IT'S CAMPING SEASON! COME ON! EVERY SPRING, THE SAME THING. THE CAMPSITES OPEN, AND DAD STARTS MUTATING. HE STOPS BEING DAD AND TURNS INTO... "A TRUE OUTDOORSMAN!" I GET THE WILLIES THINKING ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH GOING CAMPING? [CRASH] SOUNDS LIKE FUN TO ME. ARE YOU KIDDING? NO HEAT, NO TV, NO VIDEOS, NO BATHROOMS. IF I WANTED TO LIVE LIKE THAT, I'D MOVE IN WITH BIG FOOT. HONKER? OHH. DESERTED IN MY HOUR OF NEED. GOSALYN! HELP! GOSALYN! QUIT FOOLING AROUND, HONK. IF DAD DOESN'T SEE THIS STUFF, MAYBE HE WON'T REMEMBER. GOSALYN, I TOLD YOU NO SOCCER PLAYING IN THE HOUSE! NOT US. OH, BUT WE WERE JUST READING. OF COURSE. EVER THE EXPERT ON CURRENT EVENTS. TRY IT RIGHT SIDE UP. WHAT WERE YOU REALLY-- WHAT IS THIS? DUCK AND COVER! ALL RIGHT, YOUNG LADY. YOU HAD BETTER-- CAMPING STUFF! IS IT THAT TIME ALREADY? IT IS! GOS, I LOVE YOU. GETTING ALL THIS STUFF READY-- I WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN. YOU CAN KEEP MY STUFFED TOADS, BUT DONATE MY ZOMBIE COMICS TO THE EIGHTH PERIOD STUDY HALL. I DON'T THINK A CAMPING TRIP CALLS FOR A WILL. EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU'LL BE UP TO YOUR NOSE IN WACKY WILLIE CARTOONS. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY OF STOPPING THIS TRIP. WE'LL BE GOING WHEN I FINISH PACKING. IF THE CAR DOESN'T GET PACKED, WE DON'T GO. ♪ AH DA DIT BOO ♪ ♪ DI AT-DA DIDDY AH ♪ ♪ AH BA BIT BOO ♪ ♪ ZIP A BOO DA DUM DUM ♪♪ [WHISTLING] I THOUGHT WE'D BE ON THE ROAD BY NOW. BOY, HOW MANY OF THESE THINGS ARE WE GOING TO NEED? PACKING NEVER USED TO TAKE THIS LONG. OOPSIE. GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE KEEN ON HELPING, BUT I THINK IT'LL GO FASTER IF I FINISH MYSELF. AND...VOILA! A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING, AND EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE. LET ME GET RID OF THIS LOOSE STRING. [MUMBLING] FINALLY, ALL PACKED AND READY TO GO. NOTHING TO STOP US. SURE. WE'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF CIVILIZATION A MOMENT TOO SOON. OOH, YOU... AH, NOTHING LIKE MOUNTAIN AIR. GLAD THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY HAD A CAR FOR US, AREN'T YOU? THE PARK'S CLOSING. TOO BAD. LET'S GO. JUST CALM DOWN. WHAT'S THE STORY? IT'S A BEAR! YOU CAN'T GO IN. WE CAN BE BACK BEFORETHE WACKY WILLIE SHOW. GOSALYN. LOOK, I HAVE A RESERVATION. I DEMAND A CAMPING PERMIT. FINE! CAMP ANYWHERE YOU WANT, JUST WATCH OUT FOR THE BEAR. WELL, OF COURSE. THE WHOLE POINT IN COMING HERE IS TO OBSERVE THE WILDLIFE. WHATEVER WILDLIFE IS LEFT. DON'T WORRY, GOSALYN. THERE WILL BE PLENTY TO SEE. THE FIRST RULE OF A TRUE OUTDOORSMAN IS TO PICK THE RIGHT CAMPSITE. PERFECT. YEAH, IF YOU WANT DESOLATION. WHEN WE FIX THE TENT, IT'LL BE LIKE HOME. HMM. GROUND'S A BIT HARD. JUST NEEDS A TAD MORE FORCE. WHOA. LUCKY IT HIT YOUR HEAD. A TRUE OUTDOORSMAN NEVER GIVES UP. BUT A CITY GIRL KNOWS WHEN TO CHEAT. STOP THAT! THESE THINGS ARE DANGEROUS. DAD, YOU OK? NO PROBLEM. IT TAKES MORE THAN THAT TO SHAKE A TRUE OUTDOORSMAN. A TRUE... UH, OUTDOORSMAN KNOWS HOW TO IMPROVISE. WHEW! WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? COOL! AND WITHOUT USING STAKES. JUST TAKES WILDERNESS KNOW-HOW. WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE? SORRY, DAD. LET'S LET ME PITCH THE TENT WHILE YOU GO CHOP FIREWOOD. AH, REALLY? YAHOO! MAYBE THAT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA. HOW'S HE EXPECT ME TO COLLECT WOOD WITHOUT AN AX? IT'S NOT LIKE I'D CHOP DOWN THE FOREST, JUST THIN IT OUT. [GRRR] "COME ON, GOSALYN. CAMPING WILL BE FUN." HUH? [GRRR] THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME NEW DEFINITION OF FUN THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. IF NATURE WANTS TO COMMUNE WITH ME, IT CAN SEND A FAX. YEAH, BOY, I'M IN PARADISE NOW. LOOKS GREAT. BACK, I SAY! CHILL, DAD. I WASN'T GOING TO TOUCH THAT TENT. SORRY. SAY, HOW'S ABOUT SOME CHOW? IS THAT ANYTHING LIKE FOOD? WHAT'S THIS, VITAMINS? NO. IT'S DEHYDRATED FOOD. EASY TO PACK, NO FUSS, NO MUSS. OH, MONDO NEATO! THIS IS ONE PART OF CAMPING I'LL LIKE. MARSHMALLOWS, ANYONE? WILL THEY BLOW UP? THE TRICK TO MARSHMALLOW ROASTING IS GETTING IT GOLDEN BROWN WITHOUT SINGEING IT. AAH!
