WE WERE FORTUNATE TO GET THIS PHOTO OF THE RARE YELLOWTAILED BAYOU WATER MOCCASIN. NOTICE-- [GRRR] AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! OUT OF MY WAY, GUMBO! SO YOU'RE DOING A BENEFIT FOR THE BAYOU. WELL, I'M JAMBLAYA JAKE, BAYOU BORN AND BRED. OOH, THAT MONEY GOING TO BENEFIT ME REAL GOOD! OOH, I GUARANTEE! KEEP AWAY, YOU DISGUSTING BRUTE! FLATTERY GETS YOU NOWHERE. GIVE ME THAT! HELP! YUM, YUM, YUM! ALL RIGHT, WOMAN. YOU GOING TO GET IT NOW. PTOOEY! EASIER THAN TAKING CATFISH FROM A TURTLE. JUMPING CRAWDADDIES! IT MUST BE EATING TIME! AHH... I'M THE TERROR THAT FLAPS IN THE NIGHT. I AM THE SCOURGE THAT PECKS AT YOUR NIGHTMARES AND... LAUNCHPAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S A BIRDIE. WANT TO SEE MY DOGGIE? ARF! ARF! LAUNCHPAD! SORRY, D.W. AHEM. I AM THE TERROR... THAT HORRIBLE MAN'S GETTING AWAY WITH THE DONATIONS! I KNOW THAT. I'M THE TERROR-- OH, NEVER MIND! EAT DARTS, SWAMP BREATH! LET GO OF MY MONEY! WAY TOO SMALL. I'LL HAVE TO THROW THIS ONE BACK...INTO JAIL. ON BEHALF OF ALL THE ENDANGERED SPECIES EVERYWHERE, I'D LIKE TO THANK--- I'LL MAKE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES OUT OF THAT CROOK. HEAD FOR THE SWAMP, GUMBO! TIME TO DO SOME LEAPFROGGING. COME ON NOW. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPEN IF'N THESE CITY FOLK CATCH YOU. THOSE POOR RUBES HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE. [SNIFF SNIFF] UH-OH. YIII! NOBODY WILL BE ASKING FOR SECONDS ON PUNCH. THIS CITY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EASY PICKINGS. THAT'S WHY US BAYOU BAD APPLES MOVED HERE... TO SHOW CITY FOLK WHATBAD IS ALL ABOUT, RIGHT? SO WHAT HAPPENS FIRST JOB WE PULL? IT'S RUINATED BY SOME LOWDOWN, CRIMEFIGHTING CRITTER, FLITTERING AROUND LIKE A LOUISIANA FRUIT FLY. HE BETTER STAY ON HIS SIDE OF THE SWAMP. 'CAUSE NEXT TIME HE MESS WITH JAMBLAYA JAKE BE THE LAST TIME, I GUARANTEE. SOMEWHERE A SWAMP FIEND AND HIS LARGE ALLIGATOR WAIT FOR THEIR CHANCE, BUT ST. CANARD CAN SLEEP BECAUSE DARKWING DUCK IS WATCHING. NO MATTER WHERE THEY HIDE, DARKWING DUCK WILL SMOKE THEM OUT. THE CITY'S ON FIRE! IT'S ABLAZE! CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT! CALL THE POLICE! CALL MY INSURANCE COMPANY! HOW ABOUT A BROWNIE, D.W.? Y-Y-YOU BAKED THEM? AND YOU USED THE RECIPE, RIGHT? GOT IT FROM THE GULPING GOURMET ON TV. OF COURSE I IMPROVISED A LITTLE. AHH...

[MUMBLES] GUMBO, IF I WANT SHOES, YOUR HIDE WILL BE IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW. QUIT FOOLING AROUND. LET'S GET SOME LEAN GREEN. THIS IS EASIER THAN PICKING A POSSUM'S POCKET. YOU BE THE ALLIGATOR BAGMAN. HA HA HA! [COUGHS] YOU? HOW YOU TRACK US DOWN? YOU SWAMP RATS NEVER HEARD OF BURGLAR ALARMS? I'M TAKING YOU IN... IF I CAN FIND A CELL SMALL ENOUGH. DON'T WORRY, D.W. THEY'LL NEVER GET PAST ME. WELL, AT LEAST I SAVED THE CASH. SOMEBODY DIDN'T PAY THEIR ELECTRICITY BILL. NO PROBLEM, LAUNCHPAD. DARKWING DUCK THRIVES IN THE DARK. DARKWING DUCK FLOURISHES IN THE-- OW! OW! OOH! UNFORTUNATELY, DARKWING DUCK CAN'T SEE IN THE DARK. FORTUITOUSLY, I HAVE MY EMERGENCY MAGNOFLAME POCKET LIGHTER. YOUR LIGHTER TURNED ON THE FIRE SPRINKLERS. WILL THAT HELP US IN THE DARK? THAT'S THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE BULLFROG'S BACK. NOBODY MAKE A FOOL OUT OF JAMBLAYA JAKE ONCE OR THE NUMBER AFTER ONCE, WHATEVER IT BE. YES, SIR, WE'RE GOING TO FIX HIM GOOD, BUT WE GOING TO DO IT JAMBLAYA JAKE STYLE, BY STALKING AND SETTING A TRAP. AND THEN... WHOO! I FEEL SOME BIG FUN COMING ON, EH, GUMBO? I WISH YOU'D GIVE THESE BROWNIES A SECOND CHANCE. MAYBE WHEN I NEED GRENADES. [ALARM] BURGLAR ALARM! WE'RE GOING TO OUTSMART THAT CITY BOY WITH ONE OF HIS OWN BURGLARY ALARMS. THERE. THAT JEWELRY STORE. WE'LL TRAP HIM AND USE HIM FOR BAIT TO HOOK PAPA CRAWDADDY. IT'S COMING FROM THAT ALLEY. THE NIMBLE DARKWING IS FINELY TUNED TO DANGER, TURNS IN PURSUIT OF THE PERNICIOUS PERPETRATOR AND-- HEY, MY BROWNIE! WELL, THAT'S THE LAST JEWELRY HEIST THAT CAT'S EVER GOING TO PULL. WHOO! BOY, THIS HERE SMELLS WORSE THAN BEAVER INNARDS. NEVER MIND, GUMBO. NOW WE'RE GOING TO BAIT OUR TRAP. I'LL TEACH YOU TO FOLLOW HIS SCENT. YOU GOT TO HUNKER DOWN LOW SO'S YOU DON'T LOSE THE SMELL. WHEN HONKER AND GOSALYN GET BACK FROM SUMMER CAMP, THEY'LL LOVE THESE BROWNIES... IF I DON'T EAT THEM ALL MYSELF. NOBODY LIKES THEM AS MUCH AS YOURS TRULY. AHH... MUST BE TIME FOR BEDDY-BYE. I'M HEARING THINGS. I'LL GRAB A FEW OF THESE FOR A NIGHTCAP. [GROWL] I BETTER CUT DOWN ON THE SUGAR. [GROWL] WHOO-BOY! TIME TO SNAG ME SOME CRAWDAD BAIT. HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? HEY, HEY! SON OF A GUN! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BIG FUN TONIGHT. YUM! WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION ABOUT? WHOA! ALLIGATOR FOOTPRINTS... AND PIECES OF LAUNCHPAD'S SCARF. EITHER LAUNCHPAD'S BREAKING IN A PAIR OF ALLIGATOR SHOES, OR SWAMP SHRIMP HAS HIM. HELP! THERE GOES THE SHOE THEORY. HANG ON, LAUNCHPAD! AHA! THOSE BAYOU BADDIES JUST MADE A BOO-BOO. HEH HEH. THAT ALLEY'S A DEAD END. JAMBLAYA JAKE, HAND OVER LAUNCHPAD AND GIVE YOURSELF UP. THERE'S NO ESCAPE FROM DARKWING... DUCK? WHERE'D THEY GO? LET'S SEE... THEY CAME IN, IT'S A DEAD END, THEREFORE, THEY COULDN'T HAVE ESCAPED, UNLESS... IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THE BEAK ON MY FACE. THEY'VE DOUBLED BACK. I'LL TRIPLE BACK ON THEM AND HEAD THEM OFF. THIS JAMBLAYA JAKE HAS MORE ON THE BALL THAN I THOUGHT. AAH! HAH! STUPID CATS. I'M REAL GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE. I GOT A SPECIAL KINSHIP WITH THE REPTILE... 'CAUSE I'M SUCH A SNAKE. NO ARGUMENT THERE. NOW, GRANNY'S SPECIAL TONIC WILL MAKE SURE YOU STAY PUT WHEN I'M GONE. HA HA HA! ME-O, MY-O! THAT WHAT WE CALL A BAYOU MILK SHAKE. NOW, SEE HERE, GUMBO. HE MOVES, YOU JUMP ON THIS. I'M PLAYING CHICKEN CAJUN-STYLE WITH DARKWING DUCK. IF LAUNCHPAD'S BEING HELD, DARKWING DUCK WILL FIND HIM. NO PIGEON FLIES THAT HE DOESN'T NOTICE. NOTHING ESCAPES HIS-- AAH! WHOO-BOY! JUST LIKE SKIPPING GRANNY'S FLAPJACKS ACROSS THE BAYOU. YOU BEEN MESSING UP MY FISHING, BOY, AND I DON'T LIKE IT. WE'LL SEE HOW YOU ARE AT HUNTING-- FOR YOUR FRIEND. LOOK. YOU'LL FIND ALL THE CLUES YOU NEED. CLOTHES? WHY WOULD YOU HELP ME FIND LAUNCHPAD? BECAUSE WHILE YOU HUNT FOR HIM, I'M GOING TO BE HUNTING YOU. THESEMUST BE LAUNCHPAD'S. [GROWL] EASY, BOY. HEH HEH HEH. EASY. NICE GATOR. NICE BOY. WANT A BROWNIE? HERE YOU ARE. HEY, YOU LIKE THEM! YOU CAN'T BE ALL BAD... BUT YOU'RE CLOSE TO BAD. WHEW! I HOPE LAUNCHPAD DOESN'T CATCH COLD. WHAT A DUMP! HA HA HA! THIS BE MORE FUN THAN STOMPING SCOUTS. "SEE A PENNY, PICK IT UP. ALL DAY LONG YOU'LL HAVE GOOD LUCK." I'M DEVELOPING A GRUDGING RESPECT FOR JAMBLAYA JAKE. THAT BOY MUST BE PART ARMADILLO. THIS CALLS FOR A PERSONAL TOUCH. HEY, NOW, CITY BOY. LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY? WATCH OUT FOR THAT WET CEMENT. OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK. BESIDES, MY SIXTH SENSE TELLS ME THAT'S NOT CEMENT AT ALL. YOU'RE TOO SMART FOR ME. IT AIN'T CEMENT. THAT'S GRANNY'S FAVORITE RECIPE-- GENUINE 100% LOUISIANA QUICKSAND. BYE-BYE, CITY BOY. THE SAND MAY BE QUICK, BUT DARKWING DUCK'S QUICKER. ESCAPE'S MY MIDDLE NAME. BY MANEUVERING TO THE RIGHT, THAT ROOF SHOULD BREAK MY FALL. AND I WISH THE FALL WAS ALL THAT GOT BROKEN. HERE'S A LITTLE TRICK FROM UNDER THE BAYOU. WHOO-BOY! WRAPPED UP TIGHTER THAN HAND-ME-DOWN BOOTS. JAMBLAYA JAKE DOESN'T REALIZE HE MADE TWO MISCALCULATIONS-- 1--I CAN UNTIE THIS ROPE. 2--THIS WOODEN BOX HAS NO ROOF. SO'S I CAN POUR THE CEMENT IN. REAL BIG-CITY CEMENT THIS TIME. FAST DRYING, TOO. YOU SURE WON'T BE GIVING ME TROUBLE, CITY BOY! HA HA HA! NO, YOU AIN'T, I GUARANTEE. I'M STUCK IN CEMENT. NO PROBLEM. IF I CAN JUST REACH MY THERMIC HAND GRENADE... THE DAUNTLESS DARKWING DUCK EMERGES ONCE AGAIN, UNSCATHED FROM HIS CONCRETE STRAIT JACKET. SINGED, BUT TRIUMPHANT. [GRRR] NICE GATOR. HEH HEH HEH. GOOD BOY. HEY, NOW! YOU STOP TRYING TO FEED MY GATOR. THANKS. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN TO BLOW YOU UP. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, YOU'LL HAVE TO ANSWER TO DARKWING DUCK. I DON'T THINK SO. THAT'S ONE DEAD DUCK. WRONG AGAIN, JAKE, I GUARANTEE. WELL, I'LL BE FROGTIED AND POSSUM-WHIPPED. D.W.! WHEW! TALK ABOUT A LUCKY BREAK. LUCKY? YOU KNOW WHAT 8 x 10 GLOSSIES COST THESE DAYS? WHERE'D THAT SPICY SHRIMP GO? I THINK HE GOT AWAY. COULD THIS DAY POSSIBLY GET WORSE? [COUGHING] LET'S GET DANGEROUS. HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE HIDING DOWN HERE, D.W.? YOU GET A WHIFF OF HIM? HE'S GOT TO BE HERE. HEY, LOOK, D.W. I HAD ONE BROWNIE LEFT. GIVE IT HERE. YOU EATING IT? NO. I'M OUT OF GRENADES. SOMETHING TELLS ME WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO JAMBLAYA JAKE'S HIDEOUT. HOW DO YOU KNOW? YOUR CRIMEFIGHTER'S INTUITION? YOUR SUPERIOR INTELLECT? NO. I FEEL IT IN MY FOOT. GET IT OFF! WATCH WHERE YOU'RE STEPPING. ESPECIALLY IN THE SEWER. [GROWL] HELP! HELP! DON'T WORRY, LAUNCHPAD. I'LL-- YOU'LL NOTHING! YOU GOT PAST SOME TRAPS, BUT NOW WE'LL SETTLE THIS WITH SOME WRASTLIN'. WRASTLIN'? IS THAT ANYTHING LIKE WRESTLING? BEFORE WE START, GOT A COUPLE RULES. NONE OF THIS... AND NONE OF THIS. ESPECIALLY NONE OF THIS. OK, I THINK I GOT ALL THAT. BUT HOW ABOUT SOME OF THIS? AND WHAT ABOUT THIS? ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS? IF YOU LIKED THE BROWNIES, YOU OUGHT TO LOVE THE CHEF. TIME TO BRING YOU TO JUSTICE, JAKE. I GOT YOUR JUSTICE HERE. HAH! MISSED! YOU BE ONE DEAD DUCK NOW, I GUARANTEE! YOUR GUARANTEE IS OVER WARRANTY. THAT TRICK WON'T BE SAVING YOU. OH, WON'T IT? I'M THE TERROR IN THE SEWERS. NOBODY CALLING JAKE IN HIS OWN STOMPING GROUNDS! HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE STALKED AND HUNTED? YOU CAN'T MAKE JAKE DO WHAT HE DON'T WANT TO DO. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE THAT CAN. WHAT YOU GOING TO DO? YOU'LL SEE. [WHISTLES] HEY, GUMBO! LOOKEE HERE. STOP! DON'T DO THAT! HEY, YOU CRAZY GATOR! I'M NO CATFISH SNACK! YOU OK, D.W.? YES, LAUNCHPAD. AS YOU SEE, THE JAWS OF DEFEAT ARE CLOSING UPON YET ANOTHER CRIMINAL. UH-OH. UH-OH. AAH! I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM ANYMORE. I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT, LAUNCHPAD. THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS UNSWEETIFY THAT SWEET TOOTH. THEN WE'LL GO BACK AND SHOW THAT CITY BOY WHO'S TOP GATOR, BAR NONE! WE CAN NEVER BE SAFE FROM ANYONE WHO FIGHTS DARKWING DUCK TO A STANDSTILL... AND SURVIVES YOUR BROWNIES.
