 Darkwing Duck (1991–1992): Season 1, Episode 10 - Water Way to Go - full transcript 
 When Launchpad wants to be the hero for a change, Darkwing won't hear of it. However, he finds that he has no choice in the matter, as Launchpad is the only one who can fly the plane and won't if he doesn't get his wish. Their mission: to determine why F.O.W.L. is rubbing out S.H.U.S.H. agents in the deserts of Oilrabia. The answer: Oilrabia's vast oil supply, guarded atop a plateau palace, led by a beautiful princess with whom both Launchpad and DW are smitten, but who only has eyes for the "hero", LP. Darkwing has trouble adjusting to the new arrangement, but he and Launchpad will have to work things out before F.O.W.L. agent Steelbeak uses his weather machine to wash out everyone.

IF I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE A HERO. GO ALONE. UH-OH. I NEED YOU TO FLY THETHUNDERQUACK. YOU'RE THE HERO. YOU FLY IT. I NEVER LEARNED. TOO BAD. I'M NOT FLYING UNLESS I GET TO DO HEROIC STUFF. ALL RIGHT. JUST THIS ONCE, YOU CAN BE THE HERO. LET'S GO, SIDEKICK. WE GOT A CASE TO FACE. UH, AHEM, THE BAGS? DARKWING DUCK, A MERE SIDEKICK. WE'LL SEE HOW HEROIC FLYBOY IS WHEN REAL TROUBLE STARTS. THAT'S OILRABIA ALL RIGHT. THAT PLATEAU MAKES IT IMPERVIOUS TO ATTACK. SHIELDS HER, TOO. SET HER DOWN EASY, LAUNCHPAD. AS ALWAYS. [CRASH] WHOA! MAKE THAT A DARKWING DITTO! HOLD IT THERE, BIG FELLA. I'LL HANDLE THIS. NO CAN DO, D.W. EVERYONE KNOWS THE HERO ALWAYS GETS THE GIRL... AND I'M THE HERO. A PROMISE IS A PROMISE. I GOTTA TAKE FLYING LESSONS. [TICKING] WAIT. I DON'T OWN A WATCH!

LET'S SEE... THE RED WIRE IS THE TRIGGERING-- STEP ASIDE, AND LET A HERO DO HIS JOB. THERE. THAT WASN'T HARD AT ALL. BUT, BUT... YOU DIDN'T EVEN FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. FINALLY, SHUSH HAS SENT US AN AGENT CAPABLE OF HELPING MY COUNTRY. A TRUE HERO. HEY, IT WAS NOTHING, REALLY. I'LL SAY. NOTHING BUT DUMB LUCK. DON'T MIND ME. JUST LOOKING FOR THE NON-SMOKING SECTION. [CREAK] THE ATTACKS ON OUR OIL FIELDS GROW MORE AUDACIOUS, AND OIL IS ALL WE HAVE. DON'T WORRY. WE'LL LEAVE AFTER LUNCH. THIS FEAST SHOULD BE INMY HONOR, BUTI HAD TO FIND A SIDEKICK WITH AMBITIONS. OH, PLEASE! AHEM. DEAR PRINCESS, PUT ALL YOUR FEARS ASIDE. I SHALL LEAD THE EXPEDITION TO DETERMINE ANY THREAT TO YOUR KINGDOM. YOU? BUT ARE YOU NOT JUST THE PSYCHIC? AN UNFORTUNATE AND VERY TEMPORARY MISUNDERSTANDING. BUT LAUNCHPAD PROMISED HE WOULD LEAD THE EXPEDITION. HE IS A HERO. HE IS NOT, NOT, NOT! I'M THE BRAINS HERE. I AM DARKWING-- DUCK! HA HA HA! WHAT A WHIMSICAL FELLOW! HE MUST KEEP YOUR ADVENTURES AMUSING. OH, YEAH. D.W.'S A BARREL OF LAUGHS. [CRASH] OH, BOY. THE PRINCESS SURE KNOWS HOW TO TRAVEL IN STYLE. HOW'S IT GOING BACK THERE? JUST DUCKY, HERO. THE BODY OF THE LAST SHUSH AGENT IS JUST AHEAD. HOW MANY AGENTS MUST WE EXTERMINATE BEFORE SHUSH GETS THE MESSAGE? WAY, HEY, HEY. CAN IT BE? IT LOOKS LIKE MY FAVORITE PLAYMATE, THE OLD DARKWING DOFUS HIMSELF. WELL... I'LL SEND HIM A LITTLE GIFT FROM STEELBEAK'S WELCOME WAGON. A SANDSTORM, BUT FROM WHERE? GREAT DANGER! WE MUST TAKE COVER! LAUNCHPAD! [HUMMING] LAUNCHPAD, COME BACK HERE! WHOA! WHOA! GOOD BRAKES! OK, OK, YOU CAN RIDE WITH ME. I'M COMING, D.W.! I'M COMING! GOTCHA. THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO, PRINCESS. LAUNCHPAD HAS BEEN LOST IN THE STORM. HE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIS FUNNY LITTLE FRIEND. DO NOT WORRY. LAUNCHPAD WILL NOT FAIL OUR PEOPLE. TRUE HEROES CAN OVERCOME ANY ADVERSITY, AND LAUNCHPAD IS A TRUE HERO. WELL, HERO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WHAT I ALWAYS DO WHEN I'M LOST-- FIND THE NEAREST GAS STATION. THERE OUGHT TO BE ONE AROUND HERE, UH...SOMEWHERE. THE PITILESS SUN POUNDS OUR PARCHED, PANTING PROTAGONIST, BUT STILL DARKWING DUCK PRESSES FORWARD, HOPING TO PUT OFF THE INESCAPABLE-- GREAT CHANCE TO CATCH SOME RAYS, D.W. HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? WHY? I'M USING A SUN SCREEN. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? WE'RE GOING TO DIE-- SHRIVELING IN THE MERCILESS GLARE OF THE SUN UNTIL WE'RE A PITIFUL PILE OF DUCK JERKY. [GASPING] NOT TO WORRY. THEY'VE SENT IN THE NAVY. SURE. LIKE THEY'LL SAIL UP IN THE-- DESERT? THE QUESTION IS-- WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE? F.O.W.L. EGG MEN. THEY'RE BUILDING A WHOLE FLEET. FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS, I SURMISE-- DOESN'T THE HERO DO THE SURMISING? OK, OK. SO WHAT DO YOU SURMISE? BEATS ME. WHAT ABOUT YOU? I SURMISE... WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. GLAD I CONSULTED YOU. WE MUST BE LIKE THE CAT-- TREADING SOUNDLESSLY, WITH COMPLETE CONTROL. YOU THINK ANYONE HEARD THAT? I'D SAY IT WAS A STRONG MAYBE. IT'S NO USE. YOU JUMP WHILE I HOLD THEM OFF. NO. I'M THE HERO. YOU JUMP. UHH! QUICKSAND? UH-OH. SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS IS WHERE THE PLOT THICKENS. SO I SAYS TO MYSELF, "WHAT'S THE ADVENTURE IF WE DON'T INVITE THE COMEDY RELIEF?" HOW YOU DOING, DUCKS? GEE, STEELBEAK, GOOD TO SEE YA. THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT BEHIND MY BACK. STILL RACKING UP THE POPULARITY POINTS? YOU'RE THE GUY WHO'S BUILDING THE SHIPS IN THE DESERT. OH, HE'S GOOD. HE DESERVES A PROMOTION. I GOT ONE ALREADY. I'M THE HERO. LAUNCHPAD, NOT NOW! WELL, I AM. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. TOUCH OF SUNSTROKE. GOOD HELP IS HARD TO FIND. SO, BEFORE WE GET TO THE TORTURE THING, I'LL EXPLAIN WHY I'M STUCK IN THIS ARMPIT OF A DESERT. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY AFTER OILRABIA'S OIL RESERVES. YOU ARE SHARP, BUT YOU STEP ON MY LINES. HOWEVER, YOU'RE RIGHT. GAS MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND. FROM NOW ON, YOU WANT GAS, PULL UP TO YOUR FRIENDLY F.O.W.L. STATION. SERVICE WITH A SMILE. YOU'RE PUFFING UNLEADED, BUT COMING UP EMPTY. YOUR TROOPS WOULDN'T MAKE IT ACROSS THE DESERT, MUCH LESS CLIMB THE CLIFFS OF OILRABIA. THAT'S WHY I'LL ATTACK BY SEA. HA HA HA HA. YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T STAND IT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT? GUESS YOU'LL WAIT FOR RAIN? HA HA HA. OH, NO. I'LL BRING MY OWN. I'M GOING TO TURN THE DESERT INTO AN OCEAN. YEAH, RIGHT! THIS GUY'S BAD NEWS AT A PICNIC. COME ON, D.W. JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE. AHA! I HAVE IT! I'LL USE MY MENTAL POWERS TAUGHT ME BY TIBETAN YOGIS. WHEN THE GUARD RETURNS, I'LL MESMERIZE HIM, MAKING HIM MY SLAVE. THEN AGAIN, I COULD USE LIGHTNING. TIME TO TRUST THE BASICS. SHOULDN'T THE HERO LEAD? YOU MAY BE THE HERO ON THIS MISSION, BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE DARKWING DUCK! I'M THE TERROR THAT FLAPS IN THE NIGHT. I AM THE LITTLE MOUSE THAT EATS YOUR CHEESE. I AM DARKWING... DUCK. HA HA. HA HA. GANGWAY! GOING SOMEWHERE? STAND BACK, BEAKY, OR I'LL SIZZLELIZE YOU WITH A LIGHTNING BOLT. HOW DOES THIS WORK? AAH! YOU IDIOT! YOU'LL JAM IT! GET TO THE SHIPS! THE CAVE'S GONNA FLOOD! FLASH FLOOD! SOMEBODY FIX THIS THING! AH. OH, NO! DARKWING DUCK IS GOING TO PAY FOR THIS! I'M GONNA--GONNA-- EGG MAN! YES, SIR. AH. THANKS, PAL. YOU'RE A LIFESAVER. SET COURSE FOR OILRABIA. YETH, THIR. I CAN STILL TAKE OILRABIA. BETWEEN THE FIREPOWER OF MY BATTLE CRUISER AND THIS BABY, THE CITY WILL THROW OUT THE RED CARPET. DARKWING DODO IS SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, HAVING DINNER WITH DAVY JONES. HA HA HA. HEY, YOU, SURF'S UP, D.W. DUDE. LAUNCHPAD, YOU SAVED MY LIFE! HEY, HEROES ARE ALWAYS SAVING LIVES. YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAVE THAT THANK YOU. THERE'S NO PLACE TO LAND! YEOW! WHOA! [EXPLOSION] ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BRING A PRESENT WHEN ARRIVING UNANNOUNCED, AND I GOT A DOOZIE FOR THE PRINCESS. COME ON. WE MUST SAVE THE PRINCESS. HELP! [COUGHING] WE'RE COMING, PRINCESS! HELP! HANG ON! YOU ARE BOTH MY HEROES. EVEN YOU, MY FUNNY ONE. AAH! OW! WE'VE GOT TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO STOP. YO, PRINCESS, HAND OVER YOUR OIL, OR YOUR PEOPLE ARE HISTORY. YOU GOT 10 MINUTES. WHATEVER SHOULD I DO? I NEED YOUR ADVICE. IF IT'S OIL STEELBEAK WANTS, HE'LL GET IT. WHAT? MY PEOPLES' OIL? ARE YOU CRAZY? A LITTLE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ON WEEKENDS, BUT SANE ENOUGH TO KNOW HEROES LIKE US CAN OVERCOME THE LIKES OF F.O.W.L. LET'S GET DANGEROUS! HE CALLED ME A HERO! BEING A SLAVE TO A SCHEDULE CAUSES STRESS. ALL RIGHT, PRINCESS, TIME TO-- WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY! WHAT IS HAPPENING? YOU WANTED OIL? LET HER RIP, PRINCESS. HEY, I'M THE WEATHER WIZARD AROUND HERE! I'LL GIVE THAT TOWN A ZAP THAT'LL FRY THEM LIKE A SAUSAGE. UH-OH. GEE, AND ME WITHOUT MARSHMALLOWS. I REALLY HATE THAT GUY. I REALLY, REALLY HATE HIM. GEE, PRINCESS, I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT GOODBYES. OR HELLOS, EITHER. MY PEOPLE AND I THANK YOU. WITH HEROES LIKE YOU, THE WORLD IS A SAFER PLACE. GOODBYE, MY CHAMPION. D.W. HERE IS THE REAL HER-- IS THE LUCKIEST SIDEKICK IN THE WORLD. ME AND THE BOSS HAVE TO BE GOING. LAUNCHPAD, I UNDERESTIMATED YOU. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, WE'RE COLLEAGUES, BROTHERS IN ARMS. YOU MEAN IT? I SURE DO. FROM NOW ON, WE'RE 100% EQUALS. NOW, GET THE BAGS. YOU GOT IT, BOSS.
