SUCH PETTY ANNOYANCES WILL DISAPPEAR ONCE I USE THE RAMROD. OH, JEEPERS. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. LET'S FIRE IT UP, HIT SOME BANKS. IT'S USELESS WITHOUT THE ARMING CODE. SOMEONE ARRANGED AN ACCIDENT FOR PROFESSOR WADDLEMEYER LAST YEAR BEFORE I COULD LEARN IT. IDIOTS! I TOLD YOU-- GO TO THE ST. CANARD ORPHANAGE AND GET HIS GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE WAS PRACTICALLY RAISED IN HIS LAB. IF ANYONE KNOWS THE CODE, SHE DOES. UH, B-BU... AFTER WE GET THE CODE THEN SHE'LL HAVE AN ACCIDENT LIKE HER GRANDFATHER. I TRUST YOU'LL GET THE ORDER RIGHT THIS TIME. NO PROBLEM. CODE FIRST, THEN ACCIDENT. MM-HMM. THIS IS GOSALYN WADDLEMEYER. YOU WILLINGLY CAME TO VISIT HER? I'M A FAMILY FRIEND. I'M IN THE BACKGROUND. IT LOOKS LIKE A GRAPE JELLY STAIN. THOSE ARE...TEAR STAINS. WHERE IS THE CUPCAKE? THE CUPCAKE IS OUTSIDE PLAYING-- AAH! COMING THROUGH. ALL RIGHT. PLAY IT WHERE IT LAYS. OUCH! GOAL! I'M IN A GAME. CAN'T CHAT NOW. JUST PARK IT! I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A PIG. PIG? PIG? I MEANT BIG, AS IN BIG OF YOU TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN ME. WE'LL TALK LATER. MR. HANNIGAN, HERE, CLAIMS TO HAVE KNOWN YOUR GRANDFATHER. YOU KNEW GRANDPA? SURE. THAT'S ME IN THE BACKGROUND. IT LOOKS LIKE GRAPE JELLY. LET'S WALK AROUND AND TALK ABOUT YOUR GRANDDAD. CAN I? I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL RIGHT... IF YOU STAY ON THE ORPHANAGE GROUNDS. GREAT. EUGENE, HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT A PIG? AFTER MOM AND DAD DIED, GRANDPA WAS THE ONLY FAMILY I HAD. BUT I'VE MADE FRIENDS HERE. IT'S NOT BAD... UNTIL ADOPTION DAY. I'M ALWAYS SAYING GOODBY TO SOMEONE. I'M NOT A PROBLEM CHILD! GRANDPA SAID I HAVE LOTS OF SPIRIT. HE SAID WHEN YOU HAVE SPIRIT, OTHERS LOOK EMPTY. SOMEDAY I'LL MEET SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS. THEN I'LL BE ADOPTED. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, AREN'T THE ORPHANAGE GROUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE? I THOUGHT WE'D GO FOR A RIDE. I'M OUT OF HERE! TAURUS BULLBA WANTS TO TALK WITH YOU. HERE'S A MESSAGE FOR HIM. HA! NOBODY KIDNAPS GOSALYN WADDLEMEYER. NEVER FEAR, MISS, DARKWING DUCK HAS YOU NOW. I'M NOT ONE OF THE BAD GUYS! YEAH, RIGHT! WITH A MASK. YOU'RE CONVINCED NOW? STAY DOWN. I HAVE A SURPRISE. WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHAT ELSE DOES IT DO? WHY? DON'T TOUCH! I'LL SHOW HIM. EVERY HERO NEEDS A SIDEKICK. BUT HOW AM I GOING TO FIND D.W.? AAH! HANDY. HANG ON, D.W. WHAT'S THE RUSH? YIPES! YOU'LL BE SAFE WITH THE POLICE. HE'S ATTACKING. FIRE! I FEEL REAL SAFE NOW. B-BUT I-- HOW DID YOU MAKE THOSE GUYS MAD? NOTHING. HOW ABOUT ROBBING A TRAIN? WHAT? NOT A BAD PICTURE. DOES IT LOOK PRETENTIOUS? DRASTIC TIMES MEANS DRASTIC ACTION. CAN YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH? DON'T DO IT. IT'S A DEAD END. WHOA! NICE TRICK, D.W. THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOSE THOSE BAD GUYS. D.W.? ER, LITTLE GIRL? ANYBODY? THE BOSS WON'T LIKE THIS. WOW, A POLICE CHASE WITH BULLETS AND CROOKS. IT BEATS STUDY HALL AT THE ORPHANAGE. YOUR DAYS ARE LIKE THIS? NO, I'M USUALLY SLEEPING. BUT AFTER LEARNING PROFESSOR WADDLEMEYER HAD A GRANDDAUGHTER, I HAD TO REACH YOU BEFORE BULLBA. WHO IS HE? A CLEVER CRIMINAL MASTERMIND WHO, I'M CONVINCED, IS STILL OPERATING HIS GANGS FROM INSIDE PRISON. LIKE THE COMICS. ARE YOU GUYS ETERNAL ENEMIES? AHEM...WELL... ACTUALLY, HE DOESN'T KNOW I EXIST. BUT HE SOON WILL. MARK MY WORDS. KEEN GEAR! WHAT A HIDEOUT. OH, YES, IT'S JUST A LITTLE SHACK I LIKE TO CALL HOME. WE HAVE TO FIND YOU A SAFE PLACE TO STAY. CAN'T I STAY HERE? WE'RE A GREAT TEAM. I AM NOT A TEAM. I'M SORRY, BUT-- DON'T TOUCH THAT! LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT TEND TO CRAMP MY STYLE. WHERE'S MY PHONE BOOK? I'LL FIND YOU A HOTEL. OR THE ANIMAL SHELTER. I COULD LEAVE, BUT I MIGHT LET IT SLIP WHERE A CERTAIN MASKED AVENGER HANGS OUT. YOU WOULDN'T! I'M A KID-- IRRESPONSIBLE. OOH... LIKE I SAID, IT'S DANGEROUS OUT THERE. YOU SHOULD STAY CLOSE. THANKS, DARKWING. YEAH, RIGHT. WE DIDN'T KNOW THE DUCK WOULD OFF HIMSELF AND THE KID. IT WASN'T OUR FAULT. IT WAS THEIR FAULT. THAT CLOWN IS TOO CONCERNED ABOUT HIS IMAGE TO KILL A LITTLE GIRL. HE HAS HER HIDDEN. WE DRAW HIM OUT AND GET HER. CLOVIS, IF THE RAMROD IS SECURED, WE'LL SAY GOODBY TO THE WARDEN. RIGHT AWAY. OH, IT'S TIME FOR MY AFTERNOON GLOAT OVER TAURUS BULLBA. W-WHAT'S THAT? AAH! AAH! HE'S BEEN MAKING MORE THAN LICENSE PLATES. IT'S A SHAME TO LOSE A HIDEOUT AS PERFECT AS A PRISON, BUT ALL THINGS MUST END. HA HA. TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR, INDEED. CLOVIS, TAKE US DOWNTOWN. IT'S TIME I MET THIS DARKWING DUCK.
