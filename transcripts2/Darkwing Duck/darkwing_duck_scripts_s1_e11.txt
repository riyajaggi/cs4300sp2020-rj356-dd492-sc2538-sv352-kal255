 ♪ Darkwing Duck ♪ ♪ You better watch out, you bad boys ♪ ♪ Darkwing Duck ♪ [Gosalyn] This isn't my school. Excellent deduction, Gosalyn. I'm stopping to deliver this top-secret package. To a garage? It only looks like a garage. It's really a SHUSH lab. Oh, right, camouflage. Well, what do you know. This is where my old school used to be. And right over there was my house. Hey, I thought you said you had to walk 12 miles to school. No, just get back in the car. I've got a delivery to make. Or rather, Darkwing Duck's has a delivery to make. Now, wait there, and don't get into any trouble. Really? What kind of person does he think I am? Need I remind you about the time of floor wax, the peanut butter and my VCR? That was an accident. [Darkwing] Just stay put. Oh, big deal. So it's a top-secret lab full of totally cool spy stuff. Does that mean I'm gonna let curiosity get the better of me? You bet! [Darkwing] I am the terror that flaps in-- Yipe! [J. Gander] Ah, Darkwing, old boy. Hello, J. Gander. I believe you know Sara Bellum here. She is just demonstrating a remarkable new device. It gives the appearance of an ordinary stuffed bear, but is capable of firing over a hundred poison darts with pinpoint accuracy. We hope to have it ready in time for the holidays. Wow! With this stuff, even I could ace the science fair. Keen gear! No doubt, this insignificant-looking package I brought you contains a mysterious secret, vital to the safety of the free world. "Greatest Polka Hits"? You needed a superhero to guard oompahs? They're not just ordinary oompahs. Uh-oh. Better hide. [Bellum] You see, the tape actually contains encoded programming information for my latest top-secret invention. Behold! The world's first time machine. Wow! It's just what I always thought a time machine would look like. That's the refrigerator. This is the time machine. The golf cart? [Bellum] The oompahs operate its time-control mechanism. Does it really work? Well, it hasn't been tested yet. [Darkwing] And what do these do? Careful there, Darkwing. That's SHUSH property. [Darkwing laughing] Oh, what do you know? It works. Whoa! Oh! Time travel! Gosalyn, didn't I tell you to wait in the car? And miss this? [Gosalyn] Whoa! Weird-o-rama! Something tells me we're not in St. Canard anymore. Check it out! A tyrannosaurus! -Ah! -[growls] Great. Now where are we? I'd say we're in prehistoric times. [wolf whistle] [tires screeching] I don't believe it. This is my old school. Hey, I think I know that kid. [grunts] [whines] Lamont. [laughs mockingly] What's the matter, Drakey? Aw, did I mush your little comic book? Drakey? That little geek is you? No. It can't be. Come on, Drakey. My brother's got a gig for us, man. [stuttering] Oh, b-b-but it might be dangerous. Ow! Ow... ow... ow... Hey, he can't do that to me. Whoa! Dad, don't you watch any time-travel movies? You can't butt into the past. It'll change the future, and we're the future. Scary thought, huh? Ah, you're right. Besides, you'll see, Drakey's not in any real trouble. [chuckles] It's probably just a clever trick. Yeah, to fool everyone into thinking he's a... A wimp? I'm not-- Drakey's no wimp. Come on! I'll prove it. [Drakey whining] Lamont... please. No more noogies. Hey, Boxcar. You're late. The king's gonna be here any second. [Drakey] He's not the real king. [stuttering] My b-b-big b-b-brother!

[explosion] And I think I have an idea which one. Wow! Look at all this money. Aha, aha. Freeze, evildoers, or face the wrath of Darkwing-- -Ack! -Are you crazy? If you use your gas gun on them, who knows what could happen to us in the future? [coughs] I had a feeling I wasn't going to like time travel. [clears throat, giggles] Just go on about your business. Pretend you never saw us. Whoa. That's one way-out cat. Guess, things aren't always how you remember them, uh, Dad? I can't believe it, Gos. Me, a common criminal. Take it easy, Dad. You weren't a common criminal. You were a really geeky one. OK. We're back. Now, stay out of sight, until I can distract Dr. Bellum and Director Hooter. Uh, the place looks different. Ah, they must have dusted while we were gone. [Hooter] Trouble, Bellum? [Bellum] It's a coolant problem, Hooter. Ah! Director Hooter, Dr. Bellum. Boy, am I glad to see... you. Oh, oh, I get it. [nervous chuckle] You're working undercover, right? Well, I brought you back your time machine. Uh, time machine? Uh, gotta tell ya, those disguises would look a lot better if you'd lose those stupid wigs. Ow! Oops. Look, creep, unless you want a knuckle sandwich, take your machine and get out of here. Uh, maybe I'd better come back some other time. [horn honks] The king of St. Canard. The what of where? [tires screeching] This is all getting very strange. [fanfare] [chuckles rhythmically] Him? What's he doing here? What are you doing here? Here she is, Your Coolness. Yuck! You look even geekier than before. [stuttering] B-b-but it can't be! Hey, look what we found. Well, the King's sorry to bust in on you like this, but y'all are late with your taxes. But we paid you everything we had yesterday. Well, that was yesterday, and yesterday's gone, gone, gone. My, my. [chuckling] The King's sorry about that. Yeah, Lamont, baby. It's time to get a whole lot of shaking going on. [poofs] [Darkwing] I'm the terror that flaps in the night. I'm the cloud that rains on your hit parade. Ow! I am Darkwing Duck! Hey, nice act. Why don't you take it on the road? [muffled talking] Whoa! Let me out of here! Uh, say, whatcha gonna do to him, big brother? Well, I thought I'd give our little show-stopper an overhaul. [chuckles] [gasp] [stammering] But that looks dangerous. Yeah, you worry too much about what's dangerous, Drakey baby. Anyhow, it ain't you that's going to get cream-ola'd. [muffled] Hey, will you let me outta here? Stop it! Ah! Hey, let me outta here, you cash cow. -Let me go! -Any last requests, baby? Uh, how about a medley of your greatest hits, big brother? Uh, what do you say, baby? I know all the golden oldies. How about a polka? Uhm, baby... The king don't polka. [polka music] Hey... [King] Yeow! [crash] [muffled] Get me out of here, y'all! Ah! Let's rock him! Ow! [Gosalyn] Oh, wow, I can't believe it. You changed the present. That goon with the guitar became king of St. Canard. And you became... another wimpizoid. All right, we are back. And this time I'm stopping that swivel-hipped hooligan. One small problem, Dad. What? Another time-travel rule? Nope. We're too late. [King] Come on, little buddy. Let's split. [Darkwing] A minor setback. Where'd everybody go? [screech] Ah! Hiya, Drakey. [stammering] Uh, do--do--do I know you? Well, not yet, but you will. I'm Gosalyn, and this is you-- [giggles] I mean, this is Darkwing Duck. The terror that flaps! Don't mind him. He's just a little overdramatic. It's part of being a superhero. A superhero? You're a real superhero? Just like Superpig? In the flesh-- uh, feathers. Wow. Are you faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive and stuff? [stammering] Well, I--I--I can-- No, I'm not. Uh, yeah, look, we're trying to find the guy they call the King. Oh, but it could be dangerous. Not half as dangerous as me. OK. I'll take you to his hideout. [Darkwing] We'll show that phony you can't make fun of the real King and get away with it. Now, pay attention, Drakey. The first rule of superheroing is always utilize the element of surprise. -[popping noise] -Ah! Whoa... Whoa! [all screaming] Ah! [crash] I have to admit, I was surprised. Well, I hate surprises. Too bad... 'cause here's another one. Uh, that hound dog just done and went and made the King real mad. [loud guitar sound] [crash] And you know what? -What, big brother? -[birds chirping] That duck is cruisin' for a bruisin'. Oh! Uh-huh. Hyah! Now go ahead. You try it. Hyah! Oh, what's the use? I'll never be a superhero. They have superpowers like Superpig. Super phooey. All a hero needs is a little courage, confidence, and a clean cape. Why don't you try that kick again? Oh, all right. -Hyah! -Oh! Sorry. I didn't mean to-- [coughs] Don't mention it. Kick was just perfect, Drakey. Just perfect. Really? Hiya, you, Drakey-wakey. [trembling voice] Lamont... Remember, courage and confidence. Hyah, hyah. Hi-ya? Hiya? Yo, Drakey, you're tougher than I thought. How's about joining our gang? No way. Superheroes don't join gangs. Oh, right, well, if you change your mind, we'll be knocking over Royal Records tonight. What do you know, maybe you weren't such a wimp after all. [Lamont laughing] The little wimp fell for it. He really thought I was afraid of him. Smooth move, little brother. Looks like our trap's all set. Which means there's going to be some mighty good rockin' tonight. Well, this is Royal Records. Records? They're like big CDs, right? Cleverly anticipating his opponent's every move, Darkwing Duck prepares to turn the turntables on the rascally rock 'n' roll robber. Don't worry. The only weapon a superhero needs is a, well, it's-- You know, I'm beginning to see the resemblance here. Ready, Drakey? [stuttering] Um, d-d-don't you think this is all to dangerous? Oh, come on, Drakey. There's nothing up here but records. Yeah. Mostly rhythm and bruise. So glad y'all showed up for my latest hit. Ugh! [stammering] I knew it'd be dangerous. [Gosalyn and Darkwing exclamating] Looks like these two could use a little dancin' music, Lamont. Uh-huh. You got it, big brother. [King] Come on, babies. Let's rock on down, and snag us some of those gold records. [Gosalyn and Darkwing whimpering] What am I gonna do? [Drakey] What would Superpig do? Ooh! Ooh! [Darkwing] Get baff, you billars! Oh! Forget about Superpig. What would Darkwing Duck do? Oh, I know. Let's get dangerous! [Gosalyn and Darkwing] Whoa! Aah... Yipe! Bubble gum? I was saved by bubble gum? Somebody's messing with the King's music. Look! It's Drakey Mallard. I'm the toddler that naps in the night. What? I am Dark-- Whoa! Ah! Don't just stand there. Get the King back his hair! Let's get dangerous and knock that King impersonator right off the charts. [King] Don't be cruel, now. Hand over the rug. OK... -[Drakey] Fetch! -[King] No! Ah! Incoming!

Funny clothes, though. Oh, I didn't do so much. It was Darkwing Duck who-- Hey, where'd he go? I still don't get why you don't remember a duck in a cape helping you when you were a kid? A perplexing puzzlement, indeed, especially with my photographic memory. Now, uh, where the heck did I park that time machine? Dad... I knew that.
