 ♪ DARKWING DUCK ♪ ♪ YOU BETTER WATCH OUT, YOU BETTER CALL ♪ ♪ DARKWING DUCK ♪♪ THIS IS THE CITY OF ST. CANARD...MY CITY. I KNOW ALL THE STORIES ABOUT IT... ALL THE IMPORTANT ONES. THEY'RE KEPT IN THE SECRET DARKWING FILES. NOW, LET ME SEE. 36 RIGHT...42 LEFT, AND... NO, THAT'S NOT IT. JUST AS I THOUGHT. 62 LEFT. NOT EVERY STORY IS WORTH TELLING. THERE IS ONE THAT STANDS OUT...ALONE, IN A FIELD ALL BY ITSELF. IT'S THE INCREDIBLE STORY ABOUT A VILLAINOUS VEGETABLE AND ITS DEBUT INTO CRIME. IT ALL STARTED AT ST. CANARD UNIVERSITY ON A NORMAL DAY. NORMAL EXCEPT FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH LAB 356. IT WAS YOUR AVERAGE RESEARCH LAB WITH AVERAGE RESEARCH RATS, RESEARCH ROBOTS, AND YOUR AVERAGE RESEARCH SCIENTISTS. AVERAGE EXCEPT FOR... DR. REGGIE BUSHROOT, A MAN WITH A PASSION FOR PLANTS. HEY, STOP IT, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT BACK. GIVE IT BACK. IT'S ONLY A POTATO. YEAH, A MASHED POTATO. HA HA HA. MY EXPERIMENTAL SPUD. YOU--YOU-- YOU'VE RUINED IT. THEN SHE WALKED IN. HER NAME WAS DR. RHODA DENDRON. IT DIDN'T TAKE A Ph.D. TO SEE THAT SHE WAS HOT. GOOD MORNING, DR. DENDRON. GOOD MORNING, DR. DENDRON. UH, WE WERE HELPING REGGIE WITH HIS RESEARCH. I CAN IMAGINE. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR? WHAT? YOUR EXPERIMENT. HOW'S IT COMING? IT'S--IT'S FINE. MY RESEARCH IS READY TO PAY OFF. RESEARCH? HI. I'M DR. REGGIE BUSHROOT. I CAN'T DO REAL RESEARCH, SO I PLAY WITH PLANTS. GOOD ZING-A-ROO. THANK YOU, DR. DERRY. I'M NOT PLAYING. IF I'M SUCCESSFUL, WE'LL GET NUTRITION LIKE PLANTS. WE'LL SNACK ON SUNLIGHT. THERE'S NO MONEY IN NUTRITION. IT'S NOT QUALITY PEOPLE WANT, IT'S QUANTITY. BIGGER FOOD MEANS BIGGER PROFITS, AND BIGGER PROFITS MEAN MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. DID SOMEONE MENTION MONEY? MORNING, DEAN TIGHTBILL. MORNING, DEAN TIGHTBILL. MY, DEAN TIGHTBILL. YOU CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO PICK A SUIT. HE DOES. SEE THAT TIE. WHAT A WONDERFUL PATTERN. THAT IS KETCHUP. OH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT IT'S SUCH A COLORFUL KETCHUP. DEAN TIGHTBILL HAS MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO THAN DISCUSS WARDROBE. YES, I DO. I'VE BEEN TOLD TO CUT BACK ON EXPENSES. WHEN I THINK OF CUTTING BACK, I THINK OF PLANTS. I'M SO CLOSE. I HAVE TO INTEGRATE CHLOROPLASTS FROM PLANTS INTO ANIMALS-- THOSE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. YOU DID THIS, DIDN'T YOU? NOW, NOW, DR. BUSHROOT, DON'T BLAME OTHERS FOR YOUR FAILURES. CAN'T YOU GIVE DR. BUSHROOT MORE TIME? TIME IS MONEY, AND AS YOU KNOW, MONEY DOES NOT GROW ON TREES. DON'T WORRY. WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOU CAN GET WORK ANYWHERE. YEAH, AS A GARDENER. MAYBE YOU CAN SELL APPLES ON A CORNER. DR. BUSHROOT... WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? FASCINATING, ISN'T IT? LET'S SEE... WHERE WAS I? THERE WERE SIX PAIRS OF SOCKS, SOME POLKA-DOTTED UNDERWEAR, AND-- SORRY, D.W. THAT'S MY LAUNDRY LIST. AH, MY FAVORITE PART. IT WAS A DARK NIGHT, WHEN SUDDENLY, THE CASE TOOK A LEFT TURN AND HEADED FOR... DEMENTEDVILLE. THIS MAY BE MY ONLY CHANCE. THE DEAN WILL HAVE TO FUND MY PROJECT. ARE YOU READY? THEN... HERE'S TO A BETTER TOMORROW. AAH! OH, DEAR, I FEEL SO--SO--SO NORMAL. MY EXPERIMENT IS A FAILURE. NO, I'M A FAILURE. I'M SCUM. I'M LESS THAN SCUM. I'M A WORTHLESS FUNGAL PARASITE. AND YOU...YOU DIED FOR NOTHING. THE SACRIFICES WE MAKE FOR SCIENCE. YEAH...OH...OH...YES. OH, YES. AH, IT WORKED! JUST FEEL THAT SUNLIGHT SURGING THROUGH MY BODY. HEY, WHAT'S THIS? I'M TURNING GREEN. THIS COULD BE A SIDE EFFECT. BEING GREEN ISN'T SO BAD. I'M THE SAME REGGIE. WAIT TILL THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT SEES MY EXPERIMENT IS SUCCESSFUL. THEY'LL NEVER SEE ME THE SAME WAY AGAIN. IT WORKED, EVERYBODY! IT WORKED! DR. BUSHROOT. YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE GREEN AROUND THE BILL. WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR HAIR DONE, A FLORIST? WHAT HAVE I DONE TO MYSELF? WELL, DR. DENDRON, I--I...OH. REGGIE'S A VEGGIE. REGGIE'S A VEGGIE. REGGIE'S A VEGGIE... REGGIE'S A VEGGIE... I ONLY WANTED TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE. LOOK AT ME. I'M A WALKING SALAD BAR. HEY, CUT IT OUT. GO AWAY. QUIT IT. LEAVE ME ALONE. HELP. HELP ME, SOMEONE. PLEASE. [ARF ARF ARF] THANKS. I GUESS A DOG'S NOT A TREE'S BEST FRIEND. YOU MOVED! YOU CAN'T MOVE. I'M LOSING MY MIND. I GOT TO SIT DOWN. THANKS. OH, NO! IT HAPPENED AGAIN. A DRINK. YES, THAT'S WHAT I NEED. AHH. I HAVE SOME TELEPATHIC LINK WITH PLANTS. WHAT A BREAKTHROUGH! I'M THE DR. DOOLITTLE OF THE PLANT WORLD. THIS SHOULD IMPRESS THEM AT THE LAB. THEY'LL HUMILIATE ME IN FRONT OF RHODA. UNLESS, OF COURSE, THEY HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT. THIS MAY NOT BE SO BAD AFTER ALL. LOOKS LIKE WE'LL FINALLY GET THIS PROJECT OFF THE GROUND. WE'LL CASH IN ON INFLATED FOOD PRICES AND GIVE NEW MEANING TO THE PHRASE, "A LIGHT MEAL." LIGHT MEAL! WHAT THE-- IT SEEMED THE UNSOLVABLE CRIME. POLICE WERE PUZZLED, FEDS WERE FRUSTRATED, AND THE GARDENERS' ASSOCIATION WAS STUMPED. THAT'S WHEN I, WITH A MIND AS SHARP AS HEDGE CLIPPERS, ENTERED THE CASE. DO THESE REQUIRE A LOT OF WATERING? AH, DARKWING DUCK, I'M DR. RHODA DENDRON. CAN I HELP? DO YOU HAVE A RAKE? OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE. IT'S NOT SO BAD. IT COULD USE KETCHUP. DO YOU THINK DR. BUSHROOT DID IT? IN A WORD, YES. IN TWO WORDS, MOST CERTAINLY. HOW CAN YOU BE SURE? EASY. I NEVER MAKE MISTAKES. KING ME. YOU THINK HE'LL COME AFTER ME NEXT? IT'S A CASE OF REVENGE. AND BESIDES, ALL SUPER SLEUTHS KNOW A CRIMINAL ALWAYS RETURNS TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. LET'S SEE THAT BIG BEGONIA TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS. JUST ONE THING... HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET OUT? STOP, YOU SIZABLE SAPLING. WHOA! HIS BARK MIGHT BE WORSE THAN HIS BITE. NO, NO, PLEASE. THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR BEING A VEGETARIAN. OVER HERE, BLOCKHEAD. YOU DID IT. WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT FOR? YOU'RE JUST LIKE THE OTHERS... ALWAYS RUINING THINGS FOR ME. NOW I'LL HAVE TO DO TO YOU WHAT I DID TO THEM. YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS. WHO'S STOPPING ME? ME. THE TERROR THAT FLAPS AT NIGHT. THE TERMITE THAT DEVOURS YOUR FLOORBOARDS. THAT IS TO SAY... DARKWING DUCK. YOU PLAY TOO ROUGH. HURRY. HE'S GETTING AWAY. I'M A LITTLE TIED UP RIGHT NOW. THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL. WHOA! WHOA! LUCKILY I WORE MY BUZZ SAW CUFF LINKS. WE BETTER HURRY. BUSHROOT'S GETTING AWAY. WHOA! WHOA! GOOD THING I HAD A LIGHT BREAKFAST. AAH! AAH! [GASP] [GASP] THAT OUGHT TO TEACH YOU. SORRY, BUT I'M A SLOW LEARNER. OK, BUSHROOT, THE SPRIG IS UP. NOT YET, DARKWING DUCK. CLEVER, BUT YOU DON'T GET AWAY FROM DARKWING DUCK THAT EASILY. OK, BUSHROOT--HUH? HE'S GONE! LOOKS LIKE HE DECIDED TO GET BACK TO HIS ROOTS. VERY FUNNY. DARKWING DUCK, DID YOU FIND DR. BUSHROOT? THAT'S A SAFE ASSUMPTION. POOR DR. BUSHROOT. I FEEL SO SORRY FOR HIM. SORRY FOR THAT VILLAINOUS VEGETABLE? THAT FLIPPED-OUT FELONIOUS FLORA? I'M THE ONE WITH THE SWISS CHEESE CAPE! I'M SURE WHATEVER HAPPENED, DR. BUSHROOT DIDN'T MEAN IT. WE WERE ALMOST SIDE DISHES AT THE SALAD BAR. IMPOSSIBLE! DR. BUSHROOT WOULDN'T HURT A FLY. THERE WAS THAT ONE TIME, BUT WE NEEDED THE WINGS. IF ONLY I COULD TALK TO DR. BUSHROOT. I COULD PERSUADE HIM TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF. POOR REGINALD'S NOT ALWAYS BEEN A CRIMINAL. HE'S NOT HIMSELF. SHE CALLED ME REGINALD. RHODA CALLED ME REGINALD! NOT DR. BUSHROOT, BUT REGINALD. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. SHE LIKES ME! SHE REALLY LIKES ME! ALL THESE YEARS, I NEVER KNEW. WHILE BUSHROOT TURNED FROM VENGEANCE-CRAZED VEGETABLE TO PASSION FRUIT, I DECIDED TO EXERCISE MY WORLD-RENOWNED DEDUCTIVE ABILITIES. I CHECKED THE MINUTEST DETAILS, CAREFULLY WEIGHED ALL THE POSSIBILITIES, AND PAINSTAKINGLY EXAMINED EACH CLUE WITH STAGGERINGLY SCRUPULOUS SCIENTIFIC SCRUTINY. BUT LITTLE DID I REALIZE THAT THE BUSHROOT SCENARIO WAS HEATING UP. [SNIFF SNIFF] OW! HA HA HA! I WAS SOON TO DISCOVER THAT THE ONLY THING MORE DANGEROUS THAN A DERANGED HALF PLANT/HALF DUCK, IS A DERANGED HALF PLANT/HALF DUCK IN LOVE. OOH! AHH! OOH! AHH! OOH! AHH! OHH! [HUMMING] THANK YOU. HMM. SHOULD I PUT ON A TIE OR GROW MY OWN? OOH, LOVELY. SHOULD I GO FOR THE RAKISH LOOK OR PERHAPS SOMETHING MORE MODERN? AH, THERE. MUCH BETTER. OH, NO! NOT A WEED. AND RIGHT BEFORE MY BIG DATE WITH RHODA. A LITTLE BUG SPRAY AND I'M SET. THANK YOU. IF RHODA LIKED ME BEFORE, SHE'LL LOVE ME NOW. I'LL SHOW THAT OVERGROWN GARDEN THAT NO WALKING WEED OUTSMARTS ME. BUT-- TIME FOR ACTION, NOT IDLE CHITCHAT. THERE'S SOMETHING YOU MUST KNOW. NOT NOW! CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE-- I BEG YOUR PARDON. I SAID WE'RE-- CUT THAT OUT! AS I WAS SAYING, WE'RE CREATING THE PERFECT DISGUISE TO CATCH BUSHROOT. BUT THAT'S POISON IVY. I SEE. THAT EXPLAINS THIS INCREDIBLE ITCHING SENSATION. OW! AAH! [CRASH] HEY, D.W., NICE CRASH. AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A PLANE. OH, MY! UHH! DR. BUSHROOT. RHODA, MY DARLING. [SNIFF] HOW ROMANTIC. NOT SO FAST, FLOWER FACE. PUT UP YOUR VINES BEFORE I DUST YOUR CROPS. OOH! SUCH A TOUGH TALKER. COME, MY LOVE. SPIKE WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. SPIKE? SPIKE? SIC 'EM, SPIKE! [GULP] [GULP] HERE, SPIKE! HERE, BOY! GO GET IT, BOY! [CRASH] HEH HEH HEH. UH, GOOD BOY, SPIKE. NOW, UH, GO FETCH. WHEW! I THOUGHT WE WERE PLANT FOOD. NO PUNY PLANT'S GOING TO GET DARKWING DUCK. COME ON. WE'VE GOT SOME GARDENING TO DO. AH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE YOU ARE. WITH YOU AT MY SIDE, THE WORLD WILL BE GREEN WITH ENVY. THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY IN MY LIFE. [HONK] I CAN'T MARRY YOU. I'M A WORKING GIRL. MY CAREER MEANS TOO MUCH TO ME. YOU'RE A PLANT. I'M A DUCK. DON'T WORRY, SWEET PEA. I'VE TAKEN CARE OF THAT. WE'LL CONNECT YOU TO THIS PETUNIA, ADD 30,000 KILOWATTS OF ELECTRICITY-- PRESTO, YOU'RE THE NEXT COVER GIRL ONLAWN AND GARDEN. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A PLANT. YOU'LL GROW TO LOVE IT. FIRST YOU'LL GROW LEAVES. RELEASE HER OR PREPARE TO EAT DIRT. BUT--BUT-- HOW DID YOU FIND ME? YOUR ROOTPRINTS LED ME TO YOU. SOMEONE'S ALWAYS BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I WANT. OH, NOT ANYMORE! SPLIT THAT PAIR! HELP! GET OFF ME! WHAT'S GOING ON? HYAH! IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN SQUASH TO SQUELCH THIS CRIME FIGHTER. EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC. ENOUGH ALREADY! HELP! HELP! HELP! HYAH! IT'S TIME TO PRUNE YOUR WEDDING PLANS. YEOW! OUCH! HEY! HEY, BE CAREFUL WITH THAT THING. YEOW! OW! HA! HA! IT DICES, IT SLICES, IT-- RUNS OUT OF GAS. I'M AFRAID YOUR GARDENING DAYS ARE OVER! WHACK THAT WHACKER! THAT'S IT! NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME SERIOUS WEEDING. WHERE YOU GOING? UH-OH! HEIGH-HO, SLATER, AWAY! YAA! TIME TO STOP AND SMELL THE FLOWERS. AH-- AH-- AH-CHOO! WHEW! UH, GOOD BOY, SPIKE. HELP! DARKWING DUCK, HELP! HELP! WHOA! WHAT'S-- WHOA! HEY! I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING. LET'S GET DANGEROUS. I'LL GIVE YOU DANGEROUS! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] HELP! HELP! YAHOO! NO! YOU'RE RUINING EVERYTHING. TIME TO TOSS A LITTLE SALAD. POT THAT DUCK! YAA! LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE BEING TRIMMED. STOP! NO! UHH! [CRASH] SUCCOTASH. YUCK! NO! WE'RE TOO LATE. I'M SO SORRY. FORGIVE ME. WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO, MR. DARKWING? HUH? OH, NO ONE. JUST CHECKING FOR MEDFLIES. QUITE A STORY, EH? [SNORING] [SNORING] YEAH, RIGHT, D.W. THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU, YOU MAY HAVE TO EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE THEM. AHH, MY OWN LITTLE PLACE IN THE SUN. SOON I'LL BE BACK ON MY ROOTS AGAIN. HOW ABOUT SOME WATER AND SOME FERTILIZER AND SOME SOFT MUSIC?
