 Hey! Bravo, Rafa! Bravo! Bravo! Fear's inevitable. Inevitable? Yeah. I fight the bull, you fight the murderer with a gun. It's what we do. I keep it here. Where the bull can't see. You don't ignore it? Well, do you? What have I missed? I was just telling Rafa how much you love him.

 Oh, and I do. Because our nephew is so fucking cute. I just wish he'd get a nice, steady job in an office. To the next famous Falcon. Another one? No, no, no. Nothing for me. I have to go. Are you still working, little brother? Still working. Papa would be proud. I'll see you both on the weekend. Good morning, I've got something really fucking weird for you. Weird ugly? Well, let's just say it's a first. His name is Carlos Jimenez. The restaurateur? Yes. The maid found him at 7:30 this morning. She let herself in and there he was - in all his gory. Does the maid have a key? Yes. Did she use it? Was the door unlocked? I'll ask. She's in the hospital, under sedation. I'll find out. Are the cameras working? The cameras in reception are working.

 The ones covering the garage have been broken, vandalised. When? The concierge said two days ago, but with it being Holy Week, they haven't been fixed. Seal off the garage entrance to the building. Next of kin? Senora Consuelo Jimenez. Wife, much younger than her husband, and now a very rich widow. She's been staying at the Colonial Hotel. She took the kids to school this morning - two young boys aged six and eight. But as yet, we haven't been able to locate her. Judge Calderon. Falcon. Have you been inside? I was waiting for my experts. The boxes... are they moving in or out? Out... to somewhere even more expensive. His eyelids have been removed, top and lower. Skilfully? I'm not sure it requires skill. Just a sharp blade, a steady hand... Why cut off his eyelids? Because he's a sick bastard. So he couldn't close them? So he couldn't hide? So he had to look, see... You think the killer made him watch a DVD? No, I think he made him watch a film projected onto the wall. A film of what? No idea, something upsetting? Chloroform. Analyse for type, then identify all suppliers and recent sales. Let's hope it was bought in Seville. A mistake? Leaving it behind? Evidence? A surprise. My father in Tangier as a young man. The hero of Seville. Chief... chief, look what just arrived. No stamp. Left in the post. Any message? A card. "Sight lesson number two." It was marked for your attention. Two? What happened to number one? He's playing games or he's shit at maths. Super 8. Processing this type of film isn't easy. I'm on it already. She has a lover. And Dad's into hookers. Is this the film the killer made him watch? I don't know yet. This is recent. The boxes, the packing cases. The boxes are in exactly the same positions. Jesus, this is last night. He's there! The killer was already inside the apartment. How did he gain access? The girl? She's looking at the camera. She knows she's being filmed. This girl... she's either a witness or an accomplice... We need to find her. Firstly, Senora Jimenez, may I say how sorry I am for your loss. I understand... you're aware of the circumstances surrounding your husband's death Yes. Call him Carlos. How well did you know Carlos? How close were you? Are you married? That's unimportant. It's relevant. I was married. You're separated? How long? Six months. You're counting? It's a fact. And how well did you know her? Or her you? Senora Jimenez, my failed marriage has nothing to do with the death of your husband. You are about to investigate and uncover everything about my life. About my husband's life. From our business affairs to his sordid little secrets. His prostitutes, his pornography. Not forgetting number 17 Calle Rio de la Plata. My point exactly. You know I have a lover. An hour ago he was a secret. What's his name? His name is Basilio Sanchez. He is a chef at my restaurant. And last night he was with me at the hotel. Until what time? Until just before I woke the children this morning, at 6:30. Did she meet someone else? Your wife? No, she did not. That must be hard - that she would rather be alone, than with you? Perhaps it was the other way around? Was it? My point being that sometimes, even husbands and wives are strangers. I didn't know Carlos and he didn't know me... at all. Carlos was married previously. Are there any children? Two. A boy and a girl, who would now be in their mid to late 40s. The last I heard, the son was living in Madrid. What happened to his first wife? She died. I had nothing to do with it. The Senora's business accounts and diaries, you'll need to collect them sooner rather than later. Yeah. You know that, before she changes her mind. I'm meeting her at the apartment tomorrow to make sure nothing's been stolen. Huh! Just the two of you? Where is she? Top floor. Are you sure it's the girl from the film? I think so. Her name is Eloisa Gomez. One of the street girls in Alameda told me where to find her. Eloisa! Can you open the door, please? Can you let us come in please? She isn't here. Eloisa isn't here. I'm not Eloisa, I'm sorry. OK. That's no problem. We'll come back tomorrow... Open the fucking door! It's all right. Ramirez! Eloisa! Falcon. She's gone... we lost her. Ramon. May I come in? It's a year on, and a simple matter of spending time in his environment amongst his drawings, his sketches... It's the closest thing to being with him again. Do you know what my father asked me to do, Ramon? In his will? He asked me to make a bonfire of everything in his studio. No! I'm supposed to pile it high and burn it. Well... of course, the decision is yours. If that's what he wanted... Building the bonfire is the easy part, what's difficult is ignoring the question why? Yes, hm. He was very proud of you, Javier. He said you were his greatest creation. I miss him. There was a photograph in your husband's study. A picture of my father, in Tangier. Were he and your husband friends at all? Carlos and Francisco Falcon? I doubt it. Carlos had no interest in anything except business... And the children... He protected the children. It's good of you to agree to do this so soon. Leave us. Have you seen this? It's a photograph of you, but it isn't you. I know what it is. Who is she? She is the person my husband wanted me to be. She is his first wife. When did you find out? Not soon enough. It's in the past. But what I will say, is that... That woman, that relationship, dominated Carlos' life. His smile, his good humour with guests, it's all fake, all of it. Carlos Jimenez hated his life. Carlos Jimenez died a long time ago. Hello? It's Javier. You changed your number. I received the letter from your lawyer, I just wanted to thank you. About the house. No need to thank me. Two years of a bad marriage give me no claim on what will always be your father's house. Now at least we can end it, officially. Yeah. Still walking the streets at night? Are you really interested? You need help. I'll bear that in mind. I'm guessing a friendly dinner's out of the question? I prefer my dinner companions to be warm-blooded. Have a good day, Ines. It really doesn't bother you, does it? What? That you have no heart. The anniversary exhibition of Seville's most celebrated artist Francisco Falcon opens in Madrid today. Here to discuss his work is his art dealer and friend Ramon Salgado. Thank you. Well, Francisco is probably best known for the nudes he painted of his wife. And for me he's the leading artist of his generation.... How long have you worked here? Two months. I first applied for a job in her kitchen almost a year ago. Didn't get it. I asked why, when I was clearly the best candidate. And she said it was because she was attracted to me. So we became lovers... and I wasn't complaining. You've seen her. She's a beautiful, strong woman. How would you describe your relationship with Senora Jimenez? Sweaty. It's sex. Good sex. He is a distraction. The most important person in his life is himself. Is that a warning? Another fact. And who's the most important person in your life? Your wife still? She would say me. And she'd be right. So you left her. No. Then you ignored her. I have work to do. Have a good evening. I'm not the person that you think I am. Your phone is switched off. Sorry. I'm with my family. Come in. Who is it? It's my boss. This is my wife, my wife's mother. Ladies, good to meet you. My sister-in-law. Hello. Hello. My Children. 1, 2, 3. Hello. The canaries. Also female. Would you like a beer? I would. Thank you. Mama, a nice glass. Chief. So while you're in Madrid talking to the son, what do you want me to do about Consuelo Jimenez? She has to be allowed to prepare for the funeral. Which we'll need to cover. Here you are. Thank you. You'd rather question her yourself, right? She isn't the sole focus of the investigation. She's at the heart of it. Only she wins. The restaurants are a success because of her, she does everything, from washing the salad to front of house, but they're all in his name. And Carlos Jimenez was in the process of selling up. Says who? Says the lawyers of a Russian businessman who was offering big money... and Carlos was keen to sell, until she started throwing the crockery around. But would a mother deprive her children of their father? Would she sanction torture? Carlos Jimenez was terrified of what was on that film, that's what killed him. The key is in the past, I'm sure of it. The key is Eloisa Gomez. I think somebody wants you. Hey. I can see you, yeah. I'm a policeman, I see everything! And this is police business. Do you want to be a cop too? No. Come here. Papa loves you. She's having a good day today. I'll leave you to enjoy it. What's wrong? Is it hurting? Eloisa? I'm looking for Eloisa Gomez. I'm here. Have you seen her? What about me? I need to find her. Please. I like a man who says please. I like a man who smells nice. Eloisa Gomez. I need to speak to her. I'll let you kiss me. It's important I find your friend. If you know where she is, tell me. Eloisa's in love. She's gone. She's found herself a talker. He's going to give her the moon and the stars. I'm happy for her. The moon and the stars. Thank you. You're welcome. Ines. Calderon. Falcon. Esteban, could you wait in the car please, darling. You're sure? Yes. I hope you're not spying. Walking, working. How long? You and the judge. None of your business. You suit each other. Yes... we do... He does things to me you can never even dream of. Ines, I'm sure he's perfect... Hey, Uncle. Rafa, have you been in the house tonight? No. Is something wrong? You sound spooked. No... no. An open window. I thought I might have missed you. You're sure there's nothing wrong? No, I'm fine. I'll see you at the weekend. Fuck! Are you lost? Do you have a wallet? Or a phone? Wallet, phone, everything. Piss off! Don't let me see you again! FUCK OFF! How did you know? How did you know?! Senor Jimenez, I'm very sorry for your loss. Thank you for agreeing to meet me here today. I often come here to sit... to remind myself of the beauty we are capable of producing. You must be very proud. My father thought these paintings to be his moment of genius. A moment he could never recapture. Can we talk about your father? And your mother. My mother was just 14 when they met, he was 22. This was in Tangier? Yes. I was born in '67. My sister Marta two years later. When my mother was pregnant with her third child my father had to leave Tangier. He had to leave? Had to. He was hiding, running... not from the authorities. I don't know why exactly, I never found that out. And your mother? She had a baby boy. She was fine, and Arturo was fine, the baby. My sister adored him, Arturo. But we weren't allowed to leave the house. The hiding continued? Yes, all the way back to Spain, all across the south. As soon as his instinct told him to move, we'd move. After about five or six years of this, he must have thought he was safe. He was wrong. So wrong. They didn't kill my father, which might have been just. They didn't rape or murder my mother, or my sister, they did the one thing that they knew would tear my father's family apart. They took Arturo. They just took him. We never heard from him or saw him again. I don't understand... was he kidnapped? Oh, no, there were no demands, no ransom was paid, no negotiations. My father didn't even go to the police. Instead he made us swear never to mention Arturo again. Ever. Our brother was erased. My mother did what she was told for as long as she could take it. She killed herself, but my father was to blame. He knew he was to blame. So Arturo could still be alive. Yes. Arturo is hopefully... happy and alive... somewhere. How did you get on in Madrid? Carlos Jimenez has a long lost son, Arturo. Oh, yeah? Do you think he'll attend the funeral? Hopefully. The Super 8 film was processed at Fotogenica Labs. He gave his name as Jimenez. No address, no description, paid in cash. Your glass of milk? It was just that, a glass of milk, with almond. Almond? Mm-hm. Ground almond. The glass was clean. Any idea what it was about? None. Stay sharp. If we have cried much, it is because we have loved much. And now, as a sign of love, let us pray. Our brother Carlos... Ramon. Javier. Did you know, that in all his restaurants he HAD to have an original Francisco Falcon? Of course Carlos would never approach your father himself, they had history. What kind of history? North African. Morocco. Your father, myself and Carlos Jimenez, we were... pretty close, not quite the Musketeers, but close. Is there anything else I should know about my father? I found a set of paintings. Dark... unlike anything my father has done before in his work. Do you know of them? A set? Four. Yes, they're numbered. Together they make a single painting. He called it Pilar, after your mother. No, that can't be right. He did it shortly after she died. Oh, so young. A reflection of his grief, perhaps, his loss. Javier, please... don't have your bonfire just yet. I need you to scoot to the other side. I am so sorry. I'll call you soon. Senora... senora, may I have a moment? First of all, I am sorry for the intrusion. The big ugly van, is that you? Yes. We've been taking photographs. I thought it necessary. I thought it disrespectful, heartless. You don't need my permission? No. But I will need your help to put names to faces. I can't really say no, can I? That would be suspicious. That would be disappointing. Falcon. Notice anything missing? Who am I talking to? Your story is my story. We're the same. Has the address of the phone-trace been confirmed? Confirmed. 15 Calle Alameda. How do you know he's in there? We don't. What's here is his phone. Small phone, big building. There'll be a sign. We're here because he wants us to be. A trap? Are we ready? Up. I can hear music. It's coming from over there. I know this. My father listened to it. It's Eloisa. Oh, for the love of God. He's taken her eyes. Gloves, Cristina. Cristina! Another fucking sight lesson. Number three. "Why do they have to die, those that love to love," "because they have the gift of perfect sight." Cristina, find out all you can about this place. Sir, the paintings are... Imitations of the Falcon Nudes... as is the position of the body. The murder of Carlos Jimenez is all about revenge. The past. Arturo. Yes. Carlos Jimenez could not bear to watch the images on that film. He would rather have died than be reminded of it. Is your lover still your lover? No. I want you to tell me what you know. He thought she was sleeping with another man. Corrected by GeirDM www.addic7ed.com
