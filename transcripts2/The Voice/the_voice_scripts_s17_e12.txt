 Give it up for your coaches! -Whoo! -Yeah! The Knockouts start right now! Yeah! Let's check in with John and this season's mega mentor Taylor Swift. John: Well, Taylor, thanks for being here. -Thanks for -- -This is so cool that you're here to give all these singers advice because you're pretty good at this. Thank you for saying that. My goal is I want three people to get stolen from my team. This grouping -- we have James and Khalea.

 James is new to my team, but has a really lovely voice, with, like, a really big tenor range. Khalea -- she's super experienced and savvy and poised with her voice. Both of them are soulful singers. -Wow! -So we'll see what happens. -Alright. Awesome. -Yeah. ??? Ohh! Look who's here! What?! Well, hi. I don't know if you've heard of her. -Uh, yeah, a few times! -Nice to meet you. So nice to meet you! Taylor Swift. Khalea, have a seat over there. Will do. I am living the dream right now. [ Laughs ] I stole James from Gwen's team. I think she's mad at me still. No, she definitely is. Both of you. [ Laughs ] -We've got a steal! -I got to go with John. Yeah! Hey! John has been one of the guys that I've seen and been like, "I want to be that guy." In Utah, I was going to school for business marketing, and also, I work in a wholesale warehouse. I do accounting for the store. And you're in there alone. There's no windows. That's my place to sing. ? You still are ? It's a lot of hours away from what I really want to do, which is to be a recording artist. I'm singing "Stay" by Post Malone. Post Malone is amazing. He's, like, so versatile. Well, that's kind of why I picked it is because he's a blend of all of his influences. Yeah. And he really does it in a way that's, like, tasteful. ? That all that you know ? ? Is all that you are ? John: I love that they get to pick their own songs... ? You said that it's all that you want and more ? ...for this round because you get a sense of what kind of music they feel best represents who they want to be as artists. ? Tell me that it's all okay ? James, he's doing a really lovely version of "Stay" by Post Malone. ? I've been waiting on this all damn day ? I see his potential. He has a really gorgeous tone and a great range. For the first half of this song, it's talking about sort of this ambivalent, drunken haze. Yeah. And there's a coolness of what you're doing. Your eyes are more closed. You're not really focusing as much. There's a part of me that really likes how you meander, but when I think it's getting in the way is when you're trying to hit those chorus notes... Yeah. ...the... ? Da-na-na-na, na, na ? If you're walking over here and that chorus comes up, you make sure that you're planted, grounded, so that you can really focus on hitting those notes. Got it. I think at the very end, you can throw a little bit of fireworks in there. Could do maybe... ? I've been waiting all damn da-a-a-y ? -Ooh. -Love that. Just a couple extra notes so it feels more emphatic at the end. -Yeah. -Find it. Hopefully I can show off my range and my higher register and still have that emotion. What song are you gonna sing? I'm doing "Because You Loved Me," C?line Dion. -Okay. -Oh, God! -[ Laughs ] -Well... -I'm gonna cry. -That's a barn burner. -I can't. -[ Chuckles ] -I'm gonna try not to cry. -Ohh. ? I'm everything I am ? ? Because you loved me ? ? Heeeey ? Taylor: Khalea chose a really vocally difficult song, and she absolutely nailed it. She's one of those singers that knows her stuff. -Whoo! -Oh, wow. -[ Laughs ] -So good! Babe, that was amazing. -Oh. -That was so beautiful. Thank you! Your tone and everything you're doing and -- -Thank you so much. -Wow. Whenever you sing a song that's this emotional, think about who you're singing it to. You'll even feel even more emotion. You'll have even more power. And it'll come through physically. People will see it in you. Okay. Khalea: This song makes me think about my mother. Mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I had just turned 15 the year that she passed away. She was everything to me. I don't think I would be pursuing music like this if it wasn't for her. [ Audience cheering ] But she instilled these things in me. And now to see myself as a performer and being a mom, I just want to honor her with that. Everybody knows this song to be sung exactly the way that C?line Dion sings it. -Yeah. -Right. And you were really doing your own thing. The only thing that I felt rubbed a little note-wise... -Mm-hmm. -...is the first time you said, "You were my eyes when I couldn't see. You saw the best there was in me." You kind of did a counter-melody... -Uh-huh. -...that was above it. I might go back to that original melody just because it's layered so nicely. But I loved it. -Yeah. -It was beautiful. -Aw! -Yeah. -That means a lot. You are so perfect that sometimes it feels like you're not passionate. Mm-hmm. I would like there to be a moment where it feels like you have a little more recklessness. Okay. Khalea's doing a song which allows her to kind of do the full diva thing. I'm so proud of both of you. -[ Laughs ] -It's gonna be so good. I know you guys are gonna kill it. And then James is doing a song which is super laid-back but passionate at the same time. This Knockout is gonna come down to who puts together the best performance. You guys, this is such an emotional show. It is. -Yeah. -I'm so emotional. [ Cheers and applause ] For this Team Legend Knockout, stolen from Team Gwen, it's James Violet... [ Cheers and applause ] James! ...versus Khalea Lynee! Yeah! -Good luck. -Good luck to you. Khalea: Knock it out. Yeah! With "Because You Loved Me," here is Khalea Lynee. [ Cheers and applause ] ??? ? For all those times you stood by me ? ? For all the truth that you made me see ? ? For all the joy you brought to my life ? ? For all the wrong that you made right ? ? For every dream you made come true ? ? For all the love I found in you ? ? I'll be forever thankful, baby ? ? You're the one who held me up ? ? Never let me fall ? ? You're the one who saw me through ? ? Through it all ? ? You were my strength ? ? You were my stre-e-e-ngth, ohh ? ? You were my eyes when I couldn't see ? ? You saw the best there was in me ? ? Lifted me up when I couldn't reach ? ? Lifted me up ? ? And gave me faith 'cause you believed ? ? I'm everything I am ? ? Because you loved me ? ? Heeeeeee... ? ? You were my strength when I was weak ? ? ...eeeeeeeey? ? You were my voice when I couldn't speak ? ? My voiiiice ? ? You were my eyes when I couldn't see ? ? You saw the best there was in me ? ? Lifted me up when I couldn't reach ? ? Ohhhh ? ? Gave me faith 'cause you beliiiieved ? ? I'm everything I a-a-a-am ? ? Because you loved me-e-e-e ? My God! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! [ Cheers and applause ] [ Sighs ] ? This is "The Voice" ? Daly: Welcome back to night two of the Knockouts. [ Cheers and applause ] James! Now with "Stay," here is James Violet. ??? ? It's true ? ? That all that you know ? ? Is all that you are ? ? You say that it's all that you want and more ? ? Buzz off and pour another drink ? ? Tell me what you think ? ? You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now ? ? You blow your cigarette smoke in my face ? ? You're so beautiful ? ? Please, woman ? ? Don't break your back for me ? ? I'll put you out of your misery ? ? Tell me that it's all okay ? ? Tell me that it's all okay ? ? I've been waiting on this all damn day ? ? Waiting on this all damn day ? ? Call me in the morning ? ? Tell me how last night went ? ? I'm here ? ? But don't count on me to ? ? Stay a little longer if you convince me ? ? Tell me all the things that you have against me ? ? Every time we make up, the truth is fadin' ? ? Everybody's blind when the view's amazin' ? ? Don't break your back for me ? ? I'll put you out of your misery ? ? Tell me that it's all okay ? ? Tell me that it's all okay ? ? I've been waiting on this all damn day ? ? Waiting on this all damn day ? ? Call me in the morning ? ? Tell me how last night went ? ? I'm here ? ? But don't count on me to stay ? Yeah! [ Cheers and applause ] Yeah! Yeah, James! He was good. Yeah. Girl, you killed it. For real. -You did, too. -Yes! -Whoo! -Wow, wow, wow! Wow! -Wow! Gwen: That was wow! [ Cheers and applause ] Obviously, James betrayed me and left and went with the... [ Laughter ] -Oh, no! -Went with... She has not forgiven you yet, James. I know. I know. [ Laughter ] You know I love you. I-I love your voice. And you really tried to break free and, like, have, like, a really present performance. Maybe a little over-sung at some points, but you know I'm a huge fan of you. And I'm also saying, "Wow, wow, wow," because, Khalea, you're so tiny... -[ Laughs ] -...and so much air is coming out of your mouth, and it doesn't look like it. It's unbelievable how effortless you are. That was magical. -Thank you. Khalea, you just made a C?line Dion song sound easy to sing. -[ Chuckles ] -Yeah. -So... -And it's not. [ Laughter ] If she heard that, she'd be like, "Somebody get her outta here." [ Laughter ] James, you just sang Post Malone. -Yeah. -And that's really cool. Like, that was my favorite one from you so far, and I've loved everything you've done. -[ Chuckles ] -You're so gifted. -It's so cool what you do. -Thank you. Thank you. [ Cheers and applause ] Blake: James, I got to say, man, I was surprised by that performance. You hit some notes in there that I didn't know you had those cards to play, to be honest with you. -Yeah. -I thought you did a great job. But, Khalea, the tone of your voice, and when you do this with your hand... -[ Laughs ] -...when you're hitting certain notes you're just like -- Hallelujah! She's slapping the notes around with her hand. [ Laughter ] When you're singing and you're in the zone, you're as powerful of a human being as there is on the planet. [ Cheers and applause ] I would go with Khalea. Daly: Thank you, coaches. Alright, John, give us some thoughts. James, you had the right approach to the song. We talked about hitting one high note at the end just to, like, boom. [ Chuckles ] And you did it, and I was like, "Yes!" [ Laughs ] You just came out here and nailed it 100%. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. [ Cheers and applause ] And, Khalea, you remind me, in a lot of ways, of Whitney Houston because she would do this kind of big, broad kind of pop ballad, but she would put just a little gospel on it. And I heard that in the way you performed this song that made it feel like it was yours. John, who is the winner of this Knockout? ??? You both were phenomenal, and I'm so lucky that I got to work with both of you. ??? The winner of this Knockout is Khalea. Daly: Khalea, congratulations! You're moving on to the live Playoffs. I love you, too. Perfection! I worked...pretty hard. And that's why I feel so grateful that it's starting to pay off. Extremely excited. As you can see. [ Chuckles ] James, anything you want to say to John? There's not really a better person to lose to. -Aww! -Khalea was an honor to work with, and she really pushed me. So, thank you. -Thank you! -Give it up for James Violet, ladies and gentlemen! -You really are so dope. -Thank you, man. And you really should make a record. James did an amazing job. I wouldn't have asked him to do any better. But I had to go with Khalea. Only thing I want Khalea to do is show more emotion. -She's so guarded. -Personality, right? Yeah. I just want her to, like, let loose a little. Daly: Coming up... [ Whispers ] That's Taylor Swift right there. ...more unforgettable superstar coaching... Keep that lifted chorus in. ? I've got thick skin ? ? And an elastic heart ? God, you're phenomenal. Oh, my God. I'm having palpitations right now -- heart palpitations. Oh, I know. She does it to me, too. ? California dreamin' ? Daly: ...and jaw-dropping performances... ? She talks to angels ? Daly: ...plus a Knockout that has everyone on the edge of their seats. -Yes! -There it is! We got a steal! ? This is "The Voice" ? Daly: Welcome back. Let's check in with Gwen and see how she and Taylor got the next pairing ready to take the stage. Gwen: Well, gosh, I can't believe you're here. -Thanks. -I'm so excited. Thank you. I'm so excited. This is our second time together. It's ladies' night at "The Voice." It's so fun! Taylor's just walked off of a six-month stadium tour around the world. So I'm really excited for my team to get such amazing advice. I think that both Kyndal and Jessie are emotional singers, and they have their own style and personality. So that's why I paired them together. ??? Unh-unh. Ohh! Can you believe this is happening? Oh, my God! Whoo! Y'all trying to kill me. Y'all trying to give me a heart attack. I just got used to trying to sing in front of her. [ Laughter ] Come stand closer to us. We're not gonna hurt you. [ Laughter ] It's fine. We're pretty lucky to have her here. You live in Nashville. I do. And you're a Nashville girl, too, right? Yeah. Yeah. When I first came to Nashville as a kid, I was doing a lot of live shows in Pennsylvania, where I'm from, and everybody told me at the record labels, "Go home. You'll be able to play more shows because you can't book a gig in Nashville unless you're top tier." Right. She has a lot of experience from a young age, being on TV, songwriting, and just being magical. So... -Literally magical. She's kind of like a rainbow unicorn cat lover, like -- "Cat lover" underlined, yes. [ Laughs ] Gwen is a very eclectic artist. If you look at her songs from "The Sweet Escape" to "Hollaback Girl," I mean, it's absolutely unbelievable. She's a real babe, and I love spending the day with her. Thank you for picking me. I turned for him because whatever pain he's lived through, it comes out in his voice. I came from such a dark past. Growing up in group homes, I felt like there's no one there to protect you. There's no one there to give you guidance. And it just turns into, like, an overbearing feeling of loneliness. ? Ha! ? ? This I know ? Music was a safe escape. ? She told me, "Don't worry about it" ? -I put him against Rose. -I was shaking in my boots. [ Cheers and applause ] Daly: We've got a save! It's not just about a voice. It's about you and how you connect with people. And that's why you're still here. ? Look what you made me do ? I'll be singing "Dancing With a Stranger." I want to show the coaches the emotions of my voice, to show them that I can groove. [ Chuckles ] That was great! Jessie, that's my favorite I've ever seen you. Wow! That song feels really comfortable for you. To go in and have the head voice the way he does is really -- That was amazing. And also, when you were on the lower-octave chorus and you jumped right up to the high, it was effortless. -Thank y'all, guys. -Yeah, yeah, that was great. -Thank y'all so much. -The only thing that I think we need to see is a little more of the personality, 'cause right now, you're just shutting your eyes. You've got the vocal. Now you've got to figure out how you're gonna incorporate the audience into your world. Yeah, just more of you. Really assign emotions intentionally to the lyrics. Let's say the line is, "I love you." You could be like, "I love you," or you could be like, "I love you!" -You know? -Yes! You could literally express this in sort of, like, a swagger-confidence type of way. I love it. My soul is, like, right here, looking at myself and her. And I'm just like... I'm sopping it up like a biscuit! We soppin'. We soppin'. -[ Laughs ] -Sponge. Jessie is willing to work really hard, and I just am so happy that he gets to have this moment. Step into our office. -[ Laughs ] -I'm here. Thank you so much for just believing in me. I had to block Blake. That could have gotten in the way of our relationship. -[ Laughs ] -But your voice is so raspy. It's so full of personality. ? Just something that I ? ? Oh, I can believe ? Kyndal is one of my favorite singers, and I would buy her record. So, you're gonna sing "Elastic Heart." Yeah. This song's crazy because Sia sent me this song for me to do. [ Chuckles ] But it's very specific to her. It's such a weird, unique song. -Yeah. -And so is your voice. This song is just so close to my heart. ? And another one bites the dust ? It has a lot to do with rejection and heartbreak that I have gone through. My biological father and my mother divorced when I was 18 months. My mother got remarried, and he ended up adopting me. But there were always these feelings of abandonment. I reached the deepest depression of my entire life. I was just kind of in a place where I didn't even want to get out -- out of bed in the morning. And I listened to this song over and over and over again, and it gave me this strength. Why is being a human so hard? I don't know. I had to make the decision to pick myself back up again, and because I did that, look where I am. ? Until you pull too haaaard ? ? And you won't see me fall apart ? Taylor: Kyndal -- Wow! Her voice has so many different complexities and echelons that it goes to. And it's very interesting to find quirk and control in the same voice. It's amazing. Whoa! Oh, my God! You're so original! That was so interesting! -Thank you. -And, like, not in -- You know when people passive-aggressively say, "That was interesting"? -Yeah. I mean, it legitimately was interesting. I love that you stripped it down. I love the song choice. Your tone is so beautiful. Yeah, it's crazy. You've got so much going on with your voice. Taylor Swift. I know. Taylor Swift is just telling me that. So I would, like, really focus on making the beginning of the song defeated -- that lowest-low moment -- and then in the end, I want you to triumph, where you're proud of yourself. You got out of bed. -Yeah. -Exactly. People love a story, and a story needs to go somewhere. -Yeah. -Your thoughts. [ Laughs ] The song already is a very complicated melody. Yes. Yeah, yeah. And because you're already so stylized, simplify it, and if you can do that, it's more powerful. Okay. Cool. I would keep that lifted chorus in. Of course. That -- That's one of my favorite things about this song. Yeah. ? Well, I've got thick skin ? ? And an elastic heart ? ? Well, I've got thick skin ? ? And an elastic heart ? That's really pretty. Kyndal has a very original-sounding voice, and that is magical. And Jessie has a great stage presence. That's why I love him so much. Thank y'all. You have a beautiful... Gwen: So, this is gonna be a really hard one for me. For this Team Gwen Knockout, it's Jessie Lawrence... Jessie! Jessie! Jessie: Winning this Knockout would mean a lot to the kids that are in a messed-up environment. They would look at my story and just have belief. ...versus Kyndal Inskeep! Kyndal: Every day, I've been writing songs, playing gigs, and I believe that now it's really just starting to pay off. [ Cheers and applause ] Kyndal! And now, with "Elastic Heart," here's Kyndal Inskeep. [ Cheers and applause ] ??? ??? ? And another one bites the dust ? ? Oh, why can I not conquer love? ? ? And I might have thought that we were one ? ? Wanted to fight this war without weapons ? ? And I wanted it, I wanted it bad ? ? But there were so many red flags ? ? Now another one bites the dust ? ? And let's be clear, I'll trust no one ? ? You did not break me ? ? Who-o-o ? ? I'm still fighting for pe-e-e-ace ? ? Well, I've got thick skin ? ? And an elastic heart ? ? But your blade, it might be too sharp ? ? I'm like a rubber band ? ? Until you pull too hard ? ? And I may snap and I move fast ? ? You won't see me fall apart ? ? No, no, no, no, no ? ? I've got an elastic he-e-e-e-e-art ? ? Thick skin and an elastic heart ? ? But your blade, it might be too sharp ? ? I'm like a rubber band ? ? Until you pull too hard ? ? And I may snap and I move fast ? ? You won't see me fall apart ? ? 'Cause I've got an elastic heart ? ? Yeah, I've got an elastic ? ? Heart ? [ Cheers and applause ] -That was great. -Excellent. ? This is "The Voice" ? Daly: Welcome back to the Knockouts at Universal Studios, Hollywood. With "Dancing With a Stranger," here's Jessie Lawrence. [ Cheers and applause ] ??? ? Ohhhh, ohhh ? ? I don't wanna be alone tonight ? ? It's pretty clear that I'm not over you ? ? I'm still thinking about the things you do ? ? So I don't want to be alone tonight ? ? Alone tonight, alone tonight ? ? Can you light the fire? ? ? I need somebody who can take control ? Come on! ? I know exactly what I need to do ? ? Ha! ? ? So I don't wanna be alone tonight ? ? Alone tonight, alone tonight ? ? Huh! ? ? Look what you made me do ? ? I'm with somebody new ? ? Ooh, baby, baby ? ? I'm dancing with a ? ??? ? Dancing with a stranger ? ? Dancing with a stranger ? ? Look what you made me do ? ? I'm with somebody new ? ? Ooh, baby, baby ? ? Baby, I'm dancing with a stranger ? ? Whoa, whooooa, whoooooa ? ? I'm dancing, I'm dancing ? ? Whoa, whoa ? ? I'm dancing, I'm dancing ? ? Ha! ? ? Whooooooa ? ? I'm dancing, I'm dancing ? ? Dancing with a stranger ? ? I'm dancing, I'm dancing ? Whoo! ? Dancing with a stranger ? [ Cheers and applause ] Yes! I'm already crying 'cause I know that this sucks so bad. I love you guys. You both did a really, really good job. Jessie, the presence that your voice has on the verses -- It was really breathy and raspy in all the right spots. And I-I love it. Thank you. Thank you. Kyndal, you performed the hell out of that song. And that broken side of your voice is my favorite part. The only thing I would say is I might steer clear of singers that have such a similar sound as you 'cause you're extremely talented, and I want people to know you in your original form. That's why I never do C?line Dion songs. [ Laughter ] -Good. -"Is that Blake or -- or C?line?" Please, can there be a video of you singing "My Heart Will Go On"? [ Laughter ] I don't want it to be Gwen. I want it to be John. Yeah! [ Laughter ] "I'm flying, Blake!" [ Laughs ] You know, in a surprising plot twist, I'm going to agree with Kelly because, Kyndal, I think she's got a good point there. But, Kyndal, your voice is really special. -Thank you. -And sometimes people with voices like yours that have all the breaks, it's harder for them to control it. You know, you have great control and great pitch. -Thank you. -And also, Jessie, I got to second Kelly on what she said to you, too. I feel like when you went for the big note at the end, it's like, "Oh, man, there he is. There's Jessie swinging for the fence." But in this Knockout, I feel like Kyndal won that one. [ Applause ] John: Jessie, you proved in the last round just the power of your voice, the emotion. But I think this particular song just didn't allow you to do it in the way that we know you can. And Kyndal picked a song, I think, that was perfect for her vocal tone. I do get the concern about not sounding too much like the original artist because you want to be you. -Yeah. -You delivered the song with so much heart. Thank you. Like, you can do this without sounding like anybody else. So I would say Kyndal had a stronger performance, though I believe Jessie is extremely talented, and I was so impressed with everything you've done on this show. Thank you. [ Applause ] Daly: Thank you, coaches. Alright, Gwen, before you tell us who won, what did you think of the performance? Jessie, I thought that you were great tonight. A lot of people can sing, but they can't work a stage like you can. -Thank you. -And, Kyndal, you are so original. Your voice -- It's so beautiful. And it's so emotional. Gwen, who is the winner of this Knockout? It's just been so fun to know you guys. It's just -- This is very emotional, guys, because I love them both. But the winner of this Knockout... is Kyndal. Kyndal, congratulations! Moving on to the live Playoffs for Team Gwen! Kyndal -- She sings from her heart, and she just has so much style to her voice. Those are the kinds of singers I'm always looking for. Thank you. I'm so blessed and so grateful. I'm going to the playoffs! [ Chuckles ] Jessie, anything you want to say to Gwen? I love you. You are my childhood. You gave me a start. Amazing. Give it up for Jessie Lawrence! Jessie! What a lovely guy. He's so lovely. ? This is "The Voice" ? Daly: Welcome back. Let's see how Blake and Taylor got the final pairing of the night prepared for their Knockout. [ Whispers ] That's Taylor Swift right there. She's real! She's a real person! What's he saying? She's like Captain Marvel, but of music. Joana and Ricky. Come on out here! -Hello! -Oh, my God! Guys, this is Taylor Swift. Hey, I'm Taylor. Nice to meet you. Hi, so nice to meet you! Oh, my God! Joana: My sister and I always listen to Taylor Swift. I actually got to meet Taylor Swift, and now I can't wait to throw it in my sister's face. [ Laughs ] I'm gonna try to regroup really quick. Aww! Taylor Swift was around my age when she started out, except she was like here, and I'm not there. [ Laughs ] Whatever way people get music these days... We have -- We have -- ...I always notice that you're at the top, so... [ Laughs ] Thanks! Yeah, both of these two are incredible, by the way. The reason you guys are together is just you're so explosive. I know you two will bring the fireworks with you. -Yes. -What song did you pick? I picked "California Dreamin'." I'm in California, and I'm living the dream. Really on-the-nose, but I love it. [ Laughter ] It's not just me living this dream because my parents are living it with me. One, I'm not allowed to be here without a guardian. And, two, they have sacrificed, like, so much. [ Cheers and applause ] Yes! Yes! Yes! When you said "15," my eyes, they just -- like, tears. Joana: I would like to prove to Blake that I can compete with adults who are much more seasoned than I am, and some of them even do this for a living, which is awesome. [ Chuckles ] ? California dreamin', ohhh ? ? On such a winter's daaaaay ? Blake: Joana's unbelievable. She's singing notes that literally blow my mind. ? Ooooh ? Whoa! [ Laughs ] Somehow, I ran out of breath just listening to her. [ Laughs ] Oh, my God! -Wow! -That was beautiful! Thank you so much. The dynamics were perfect. The only thing is that we all have our comfort-zone motions that we do. Mm-hmm. And yours is this. Okay. [ Laughs ] And I love it, but it can just get a little bit repetitive. With your hand doing this, you don't want it to seem like it's just too easy for you. Okay. You know, you want to look like you're laying everything you have on the line. 'Cause it sounds like this is life-or-death for you -- this performance, vocally. -[ Laughs ] -Mm-hmm. -That's what you're giving. So, do you feel comfortable coming to the front and kind of telling the story of it? You take a walk over here. You're telling them this part of the story. I think that would layer the performance, visually. Okay. ? Stopped into a church ? ? I've passed along the way, yeah ? ? Well, I got down on my knees ? Taylor: When someone is that talented vocally, the icing on the cake is when they can sell you the emotions, too. God, you're phenomenal. Don't you think she perfectly took that one note and just made it feel like the lyrics hit you harder? -Ohh! It was great! -Oh, my God. I'm having palpitations right now -- heart palpitations. Oh, I know. She does it to me, too. It's happening to me right now. [ Laughs ] Joana: Taylor Swift calling me phenomenal -- I had no words. You saw me. I mean, I don't know if you did, but I was just standing there with my heart palpitations. What are you gonna be singing, man? "She Talks to Angels" by the Black Crowes. Oh, God, yes! It's a song I grew up listening to. I'm a '90s kid. -Yeah. -I feel you on that. -I saw your cover of it, by the way, on YouTube. Don't take any pointers. I did. I actually took some notes from there, for real. It was very good. -Thank you. Who's the lead singer of The Black Crowes? Chris Robinson. Yeah. He's got a little bit of that element. Absolutely! You know what I mean? Ricky: I picked this song because Blake had compared me to Chris Robinson. I think the coaches heard that in the Blinds, and that's why they turned four chairs. My hero! Thank you! It also is my girlfriend's favorite song. She comes to all my gigs in Austin. To have somebody that actually believes in you is hard to find, and that's who she is for me. ? Said she talks to ange-e-e-ls ? Blake: I know firsthand this song is a tough one to sing. ? Says they call her out by name ? You really have to have your heels dug in and be prepared to deliver a strong, range-y, powerful vocal. If this song has too much finesse in it, it stops being a rock song. You changing the melody a little bit... Might take it away, huh? It a little bit takes away from the urgency of this vocal, 'cause the record... ? Says she talks to ? And you're doing it... ? Says she talks to an-- ? I would come in with that punch-in-the-face vocal. Blake's not needing you to do as much complicated vocalizing as much as he needs to believe you. It's really got that to it. You just need to make it easier on yourself. There's something about the way you stand and attack a lyric that is -- kind of reminds me of the way that Springsteen plays. -Cool. -But if you have a guitar on and you're not playing it for the first minute, either have it maybe down here or -- or decide you're not playing it. 'Cause you don't want it to look like it's just ornamental. -Okay. -But I think it was great. -Good notes. -See? She knows what she's doing. That's why she owns Swift Airlines! -[ Chuckles ] -That's a lie. -She's very successful. -There's no such thing. I see it in Las Vegas parked all the time -- Swift Airlines. -No, that's a trucking company. -Swift... -Oh, you own a trucking company? -No. -That's awesome. See? -[ Chuckles ] You could, too, someday, Ricky. That's the dream. -This is Blake Lively. -[ Chuckles ] -I wish. -Me, too. Ricky: I'm gonna go out there without my guitar and just sing the song authentically, how it's written. -Can we get a picture? -[ Laughs ] I love both of these artists, but it's gonna be a tough decision. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Can someone air-drop it to me? Please, God, get her this picture before she has a heart attack! Yeah. Are they gonna -- Are they gonna send that to me? Can someone e-mail me the pic? If you get that, can you message me? Yes, I will send it to you, for sure. [ Laughs ] [ Cheers and applause ] With "California Dreamin'," here's Joana Martinez. ??? ? All the leaves ? ? Are brown ? ? And the sky is gray ? -Yeah. -? I've been for a walk ? ? On a winter's day ? [ Cheers and applause ] ? I'd be safe and warm ? ? If I was in LA ? ? California dreamin', ohhh ? ? On such a winter's da-a-a-a-y ? ? I stopped into a church ? Alright. ? I've passed along the way ? ? Well, I got down on my knees ? ? And pretended to pra-a-a-y ? ? You know the preacher likes the cold ? ? He knows I'm gonna sta-a-a-y ? ? California dreamin', ohhh ? ? On such a winter's da-a-a-a-y ? ? If I didn't tell her ? ? If I didn't tell her ? ? I could leave today ? ? I could leave today ? ? California dreamin', ohhh ? ? California dreamin' ? ? On such a winter's da-a-a-a-y ? ? On such a winter's day ? ? On such a winter's da-a-a-y ? ? On such a winter's day ? ? On such a winter's d-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-y ? [ Cheers and applause ] -All right. -She closed it off at the end. ? This is "The Voice" ? Daly: Welcome back to the Knockouts. Now singing "She Talks to Angels," here's Ricky Duran. He's got a good stage name -- Ricky Duran. Yeah. Ricky Duran. ??? ? She never mentions the word "addiction" ? ? In certain company ? ? Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan, babe ? ? After you meet her family ? ? Says she talks to angels ? ? Says they all know her name ? ? Oh, yeah, she talks to angels ? ? They call her out by her name ? -? Name ? -? Yeah, babe ? ? She don't know no lover ? ? Uh-huh ? ? None that I've ever seen, yeah, yeah, yeah ? ? Yeah, to her it don't mean nothin' ? ? But to me, yeah, me ? ? It means everything ? ? Oh, yeah ? ? She talks to angels ? ? They call her out by her name ? ? Her name, yeah ? ? Well, she talks to angels ? ? They call her out now ? ? Ohhh, yeah, they ? ? Call her out by her name ? ? They call her by her name ? -Wow, yeah! -Yeah, Ricky! ??? Alright! That was awesome! [ Cheers and applause ] Yes, sir. That was fantastic. Joana, I didn't expect that from you, but it was a cool version of the song. My favorite parts of your voice, I think, are the higher parts. Thank you. Ricky, I really love your stage presence. I feel like your body is really conveying the emotion of the song, and you have a great tone. Thank you. I think I would choose Ricky out of this situation, Blake. [ Applause ] Joana, I would think being a 15-year-old girl, you would pick something that would be more, like, "Oh, I want to be like Ariana Grande." So, to pick an older song and then do the twist on it and show how much vocal ability you have was pretty impressive. And, Ricky, I think that your voice is incredible, but your stage presence is something that you can't really be taught. But I'm really fascinated by Joana because I want to see more of what she's gonna do. I would probably say Joana. Thank you. [ Applause ] Kelly: I turned for both of you in the Blinds. I thought that both of you picked a song that really highlighted what your strengths are. Joana, I think that there is some kind of spark in you that is very interesting, and it is always fun to see someone young, like, progress on this show. But, Ricky, you're bad! You're good! [ Chuckles ] "You're bad. You're good." -Like, it's so good. -[ Raspy voice ] Bad! Your rasp, your soulfulness -- You're just experienced. At this point in the competition, it would be smarter to go with Ricky, but, Joana, I can't wait to hear a record from you one day. Thank you. Daly: Thank you, coaches! Alright, Blake, give us some thoughts. My thoughts are empty because -- Most of the time. [ Laughter ] Like when you were getting dressed today. Yeah. [ Laughter ] Joana, when I got you in the blind auditions, I was shocked. I'm continuously blown away by your talent. Thank you. And, Ricky, you're my only four-chair turn, and you came on this show with the mind-set of, "I want to be coached," and that's something that I really respect about you. [ Applause ] Daly: Well, Blake, the time has come. Who's the winner of this Knockout? [ Sighs ] The winner of this Knockout... is Ricky. Ricky, congratulations! You are moving on. We'll see you in the live Playoffs. Congratulations! Blake: Ricky Duran is not only soulful. He also rocks. I know I'm gonna be able to count on him in these live performances. Man, killer job. We're going to the live shows, baby! Whoo! Daly: Coaches, let me remind you Joana is available to steal. Joana, what would you like to say to your coach? I'm just so surprised to even be standing here right now, and I'm so beyond grateful. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Blake. Give it up for Joana Martinez, ladies and gentlemen! ??? -Hey! -There it is! We've got a steal! Gwen Stefani! Yes! Gwen: I turned for Joana in the blinds, and I've always wanted her from the very beginning. -Oh, yes! -Come on! I can't wait to get to know her and figure out who she wants to be. Still in the family. It's the same household. -Yay! -Really good. ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
