 Suspects (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 The police are called to the Green Pit night club, whose owner Kirk Hawthorne has been assaulted though his sister Ziggy has sustained very severe head wounds, putting her in a coma, and had clearly been taking a large quantity of ecstasy substitute PMA. Then the body of Tom Yeoman, another PMA user, is found in an alley way. Ziggy's friend Hannah claims that Ziggy had ingested a huge amount of PMA but Kirk denies that she used drugs. Jack goes after security chief Dave Mastings since the CCTV footage is missing and he should have conducted searches given that the club had only recently reopened after closure for a drugs death. Dave admits to disposing of Tom's body on Kirk's orders whilst Hannah tells the police that Ziggy was in a very bad mood having discovered that Wakim, a boy she fancied, was actually Kirk's lover. Eventually the police discover who was making and selling the drugs but must still deduce whether the attacks were drug motivated or crimes of passion.

 "Police have tonight been called to the troubled Green Pit nightclub." "First reports suggest that club-owner Kirk Hawthorne has been the victim of a brutal assault." Victim's Kirk Hawthorne. Hit in the back of the head. - Blood is leading to the door. - Look! Got another one! Fuck! Yeah? Where? Down here? Yeah, it's down here. Shit. Is she breathing? When did you find her? Just now. Was anyone else here? Nobody. OK, guys. Back up the stairs. Don't touch anything. This is potentially a second crime scene. Up the stairs! Have we got an ID on the victim yet? Ziggy Hawthorne, Kirk's sister.

 Are you security? Yeah, head of security. Take them down to the ambulance and come back here. I wanna have a chat with you. No problem. Two victims from the same family in one evening. That's got to be the same assailant and a targeted attack, surely. Potentially, but you don't want to jump to conclusions straight away. Let's go and check in here. Yep. OK. When you're finished there, I need these cables dusted for prints. Can you get on that? Charlie! Yeah? Is your radio broken? Er, no, it's not. Why can't I get in touch with you? CCTV recorder's been taken. Someone's trying to cover their tracks. Annalise is gonna dust these for fingerprints. Are the takings kept in here? No, takings aren't here. Takings are in the back bar. It's still locked.

 I haven't been able to get in there yet. Also in the back bar is the bar manager, Guy Ollersbury... Ollers-... Guy what? Who made the 999 call. He probably... He found Kirk. Go and talk to him. Butter him up. Use your wit, charm and - Is he hot? Charlie... Is he? Cos I'm only going if he is. Charlie, it's three in the morning. Go and talk to him. This job is fucking killing me, I swear. OK. Thanks, Annalise! What's your name? It's Guy. Surname? Ollerbury. O- L-L-E-R-B-U-R-Y. Can you just run me through what happened? Um, yeah. I don't remember much. I went upstairs to drop some cash off into the office. As soon as I opened the door, I just saw Kirk lying there, just covered in blood. So I went straight for the phone, called 999. Yeah. I wish... I wish I could've found Ziggy as well. Who was Ziggy with this evening? Um, a couple of people. One guy I see around a lot, guy called Wakim. Um... He's a bit of a wannabe boxer from around here. How many guys did you have on security? Five. In this room? Yeah. One here, overseeing the VIP area, one person here by the DJ box, to make sure no-one gets in. Two people either side of the dance floor where the main action takes place, one person by our exit, where we do make exits if ever there's any trouble or if anyone's trying to get out, just cos it trips the alarm. I'm gonna need names, contact details, for all those guys, just to have a chat with them. I'll get those off you later. Was there any physical, verbal threats made to Kirk in the last couple of weeks? Not that I'm aware of. I spoke to the hospital. Ziggy has suffered a brain haemorrhage, also a drugs overdose, but they don't know what yet. Kirk's had a lucky escape. Head injury not as bad as it looked, so he's groggy, but OK for interview. We should head down there now. Yeah, absolutely. Er, news. Yeah? Er, Kirk Hawthorne, our nightclub owner... Yeah? ..is clean, but his club was closed last year after drugs-related violence left a man dead. Got his licence back a couple of months ago after getting rid of the old door team, who they thought controlled the drugs supply. That's it. Excuse me. You can go in now. OK. Has Kirk been told about Ziggy's condition? I have no idea. I spoke to a nurse, though. She said she was in a pretty bad way. We need to know what she's taken and how dangerous it is. See you back at base. Just through here? Mr Hawthorne? My name is Detective Sergeant Jack Weston. I know this is not ideal circumstances for some questions, but it's important for me to get as much information as possible while it's still fresh in your mind. Do you have any reason to believe why someone might have attacked you? I have no idea, I'm afraid. No? Do you remember anything from last night? I remember just before, I was walking around just greeting people, you know, buying rounds for regulars and stuff. And then got to my office... Gone. That's it. Yeah. Toxicology report... Great... on Ziggy. Yeah? She ingested PMA, which is an ecstasy substitute. Effects include increased heart rate and increase in body temperature. Yeah? Should we wake up the boss? Not necessary. Really? Yeah. Hello, Wakim. Hello. Right. Ziggy Hawthorne... is a friend of yours? Yeah, sort of. Um, she's just one of my clients. Um, I do a bit of personal training. I'm a professional boxer, er, and I do personal training on the side. OK. To pay the bills. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. All right. So... I mean, you say she's a client, but you spend time with her outside of that? You hang out? That's how we met. And then we got on really well, so now we just chill together. Are you two together? No. No. OK. Right. So, you were at the Green Pit tonight with Ziggy. Mm-hm. But you weren't there when the police were called. No. I left early. Right. Um, because I don't really like going out, and I had training in the morning, so... OK. Who else were you two there with? Um, Ziggy's friend Hannah. Er, does Hannah have a last name? Um, what's her second name? Hannah Stevenson. Stevenson. Yeah. Hannah, you know someone called Ziggy Hawthorne. Yeah. She's my best mate. We, um... We go to uni together. If she's your best mate, where were you when she had an accident and the police were called? Um... Do you know something about Ziggy's drug overdose? She was caning it down. I... I only took a little bit. A little bit of what? PMA. But, um... not as much as she took. She was taking a lot. It's starting to wear off now, so... I feel a lot better. Right. So at some point you took the drugs, and then you left, or what happened? I felt really weird, so I went outside to get some fresh air. And I thought the best thing to do was to go home, to go back to my hall, so... OK. Hannah, after this I want you to go right to the hospital. I feel fine. You've taken the same thing as Ziggy. It's wearing off now. It's fine. She's really, really unwell. OK? Where did Ziggy get the drugs from that you two took? I don't know. Um... Maybe... I don't know who, but it was someone off campus. Forgive my directness. Do you think Ziggy was a regular drug user? No. No. How can you be so sure? She's my sister. She... She's a student. Yeah. Yeah. You were a student? Yeah. I know what it's like, but she lives with me. You know, I... I know her. I see her every day. Do you have any reason to believe drugs might be back on your premises? I know you had a big drug problem before. I tell you what - if I find... If I find the person that gave my sister that shit... Mr Ollerbury... Mr Ollerbury, calm down. OK. You need some rest. You need to recover. You've had a very, very serious head injury. I know you're emotional, but don't make any rash decisions. Anything you do now, call me. I'll give my number to the nurse. Call me or one of my colleagues, and we'll deal with it. Sarge? Bad news. A uniform found this guy dead in an alleyway. His name was Tom Yeoman, and he's only 19. OK. When his jacket pockets were turned out, they found a flyer for DJ night at the Green Pit, and a wrap of white powder which forensics have confirmed is PMA. This is him. OK. Two PMA overdoses. One dead in the alleyway, one critical in hospital. I got to ring the boss. "Police have named a man found dead in an alleyway last night from a suspected drug overdose as 19-year-old Tom Yeoman." Our thoughts are, of course, with Tom Yeoman's family following this tragedy. The precise cause of Tom's death is yet to be established, but we do believe it is linked to a batch of the drug PMA. If anyone has experienced any adverse effects from the drug, we would urge them to seek medical attention as soon as possible. We are appealing to any witnesses to come forward in the case with any information, as we do need to get this drug off the streets of East London. Thank you so much for your time, ladies and gentlemen. Toxicology report. Tom Yeoman's results are exactly the same as Ziggy Hawthorne's, so drug's from the same source. Yeah. Boss, Annalise down at forensics at the crime scene said that the DNA on the cables of the CCTV recorder belong to Dave Mastings, head of security at the club. Arrest him for theft as a kick-off, and we'll search his premises. Great. OK. Go up to the desk. Do you understand why you're being arrested? Property, please. Empty your pockets slowly. How many keys do you have?! Do you deal drugs in the club, Dave? No, I don't deal drugs in the club or anywhere else, for that matter. What about the CCTV? You're in charge of the CCTV. Yeah. The recording's gone missing. That's the first I've heard of it. Really? I'm not selling the CCTV recording. Your fingerprints are all over the cables removed from the back of it. I'm head of security. I work with that CCTV recorder every single day. It involves fiddling with the wires? It's a cheap kit. Kirk skimped out on it, so yeah. I'm stood fiddling with the wires, turning it on and off, rebooting it, trying to get it to work, pressing play, stop, fast forward, rewind. My prints are all over it. You're a clever man. Always an answer for everything. Who else are you talking to? People who come into the club? Ziggy's friend, Wakim? Have you spoke to him? Don't worry. We're keeping ourselves busy. In fact we are searching your house as we speak. Isn't it your job, as head of security, to stop drugs from coming into the club in the first place? Yeah. So we got one dead... ..one girl in a critical condition in hospital. You're responsible for that. Which is why I told you to ask Wakim. We're not interested in Wakim. Well, you should be interested. He's inside with the boss's sister, so he comes into the club every single night. He doesn't get patted down. Him and Ziggy are allowed into my club without getting patted down. Yeah, I'm head of security. It infuriates me. All right? And this Wakim, he's a boxer. He's not a prize fighter. He doesn't earn thousands of pounds, yet he's showing up to my club every single night in a flash car, new clothes, nice new watches, bling, all this sort of stuff. Where does he get the money from? I hear that that bright, shiny Audi convertible outside belongs to you. No. It's... It's, er, Ziggy's car. Then, why is it here? Cos she let me borrow it. OK. Safe to assume you're insured. Not... Not yet. I've just been really busy with work and training. I haven't had time to insure it. Oh. Why did Ziggy lend you her car? Just to... ..build my profile as a boxer. You need to get those title fights, you need to start living that life. OK. What's your relationship with Ziggy? Me and Ziggy are just friends. Just friends? She ain't my type of girl. I don't like white girls. Why do you hang around her so much? Cos she's a good laugh. What's wrong with hanging around with a girl? Sort out that insurance by the end of the day or I'll come back and arrest you. Right? All right? Yeah. Great. See you later. Update, guys. I spoke to Tom Yeoman's friends. They confirm that they were in the Green Pit nightclub last night. They say they're occasional drug users but didn't realise Tom had any on him. He went to the loo about 11:30 and never came back, but they thought he was... sharking. Really? J-Bomb knows what that is. I haven't sharked in a long time. Tell the old lady what sharking is. Have you never been sharked? Guys cruising clubs looking for chicks. Yes, I have. Right. Yes. And? OK. There's no evidence of Tom Yeoman leaving the club via the front door. CCTV proves that. Pathologist's initial report says death happened any time between 11:30 and 2:00 AM, so what's to say that the nightclub owners - hear me out - came into the toilets, found Tom overdosed in a cubicle, take him out in order to maintain their reputation, put him in a car and dump him somewhere else? After the last incident at the club. I see what you mean. Hannah, do you recognise this man at all? No. You didn't see him in the club last night? He didn't chat Ziggy up? No. She was with me the whole night. Even when you went to the toilet? Yeah. I mean, even if... I dunno. She only has eyes for Wakim anyway. She's obsessed with him. When I spoke to Wakim, he said there was nothing going on. Well, there definitely is. They've been hanging out for ages. She really likes him. Do you think he sold her the drugs that you two took? No idea. Even if he did, she wouldn't tell me, I don't think. I thought you two were best mates. You go to the loo together. Surely you share everything. Well, I dunno. She loves Wakim. You definitely don't recognise him at all? No. OK. Thank you. OK, guys. CCTV is in from the alley. About bloody time, too! Right. Let's have a look. Yeah? Pull it through. I'll get it up. OK. Tell me when it's on. Yeah. What's going on? Here we go. Do we have any angles on the rest of this street? I think it's just this one. Is this what I think it is? This is Green Cross Street. Oh, Tom Yeoman, man. Taken out of the nightclub, dumped in the alleyway. Ten points, Detective Sergeant Jack Weston. Who do you reckon that is? Kirk? We're never gonna get off this quality... We're never gonna get that plate. No make or model either. No. Hang on, there. What's that brake light? Only one? Look at that. You know what? Whoever's got the CCTV recorder from the club, they know what the bloody hell's going on, don't they? Gimme two seconds. I'm just gonna check something. Where you going? Gimme two seconds. Fucking freezing down here. Can I get Dave Masting's property? Sure. Any time today. Have you been keeping that door open? No, no, I'll take the bag. Sign for it. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Boss? This is Dave Masting's belongings. Er... Keys from the nightclub, all accounted for. Personal keys, all accounted for except for one. So maybe it is something to do with this gym membership card. Locker. Bish-bash-bosh! Well done, Jack. You should be a detective. Thank you. Did you hear that? Just you wait. I've just been through all our key players in traffic. Hawthorne was issued with a vehicle-defection notice ten days ago, for a defective brake light. Boom! My top team! Morning, Felicity. Hey, Jacko. Hey, boss. Definitely Kirk Hawthorne's car. Broken brake light, and, er... well, a couple of chunks of puke in the back seat. Yeah. Presumably we'll discover that belonged to the victim. The question is, who was driving? Kirk? How are you? Fine. Feeling OK? Better, thank you. And Ziggy? I, um... I haven't really seen her, but the doctor said she's stable. And you? Can you stand? Yeah. Can you stand for me now? Kirk Hawthorne, I'm arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to commit manslaughter. It may harm your defence if you fail to mention something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be used in evidence. Can I get dressed, please? Can you change your clothes? Yes. OK. You got two minutes. I'll sit in here. Don't go too far. There's a young man, Tom, who suffered an overdose in your club. He was then removed and taken to an alleyway. He's dead. Customer of yours, right? Now a dead customer. Could have been your sister, couldn't it? OK. Can you take them away now? Your little sister, that could've been. I'm pretty confident that forensics will prove that this lad was transported in your car. I've already told you I don't know anything about that. That's your car. Well, yeah. I leave my keys in my office on my desk, so any member of staff could have access to my car, so... Hello, Guy. Hello. Do you recognise this man at all? Er, no. Don't think so. Not even from the club last night? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I may have... I may have served him last night, yeah. Did you see him apart from that? Er, don't think so. Busy night, big bar. Mm. OK. How long have you worked at the Green Pit? Er, just a few weeks. Five... This is my fifth week now. Er, yeah, just after I got back from a little holiday. Oh, where did you go? Er, to Switzerland. Oh? To Verbier. Very nice. Yeah. I have no idea where that is, to be honest. It's very beautiful, very good for snowboarding. OK. Barmen obviously get paid way too much. Actually, that's why I got the job. Threw away all my student loan on it, so, er, I need the hours there. That's a lot of money. How long did you go for? Just over three weeks. It's very expensive. But worth it. Worth it. OK. How's it going? I'm still waiting on a warrant to get into Dave's gym. Er, thoughts on Guy? He has expensive tastes. I don't know who's worse - him or Wakim. Forensics come back on Kirk's car yet? Two seconds. Boss? Yeah, I'm up on the roof. Really? That confirmed? OK, great. I'll be down in two seconds. OK. Bye-bye. Guess whose fingerprints are on the steering wheel of Kirk's car. Kirk's? No! Dave Mastings'. Finish your cigarette. Let's go. Big Dave! Have you ever driven Kirk's car? No. How come your fingerprints are all over the steering wheel? I moved the car a couple of weeks ago to make room for a delivery. We had a big lorry coming in. The car was in the way, so I moved Kirk's car for him. Well, I'll make it my business to talk to that lorry driver. Good. Where's the CCTV, Dave? No comment. Your "no comment" s aren't going to get you very far any more, cos I've got a warrant to search your locker at the gym. What's in your locker, Dave? Don't tell me - no comment. Bingo. Boss? It's me. Got the CCTV recorder. Same serial number and everything. Dave Mastings is our guy. OK. I'll be back in five minutes. Let me check something. That you, driving Kirk's car? Taking the body out of the back seat? That kid's dead now. That one's a little unclear. I've got something else to show you. Might jog your memory. Oh, look! Who's that, Dave? Have you got a twin brother? No comment? I'd like to see my solicitor. Kirk Hawthorne informed me about an OD victim in the gents'. Kirk was panicking. He did not want to lose his license and livelihood. I know it was wrong, but I decided to take the victim from the club via the fire door, and I drove him to an alleyway in Kirk's car. The victim was still alive when I left him in the alleyway. When I returned to the club, the bar manager informed me that Kirk Hawthorne had been assaulted. I told him to phone an ambulance. I removed the CCTV recorder. I hoped the identify the person or persons dealing drugs. Did you not think to call an ambulance? You could've saved that boy's life. I intended to call an ambulance, but when I got back to the club and Kirk had been assaulted, I got caught up in the mayhem of that, and I forgot. I'm sure that will be a real comfort to his parents. I don't believe you when you say you knew nothing about Dave removing Tom from your club. About a young man overdosing in your club. Kirk! OK. What we actually know is that Tom took drugs in your club. OK? Number one. We know that his body was dumped using your car. Dave Mastings has given us a statement to say that you knew all about that. He dropped you in it, Kirk. Still gonna say you know nothing? The kid's dead. He's dead. He died on your watch. I'm s-... I'm sorry. OK? I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know where the drugs came from. I have no idea. Did you order Dave to take him out of the club? Is that a yes? Yeah. Was Tom dead before you let him move him? I don't know. I don't know. I swear I don't know. I didn't think he was dead. Don't say I don't look after my team. Thank you! Your little public appeal worked? It did. There's two white wraps with white powder round them left in a nightclub this morning. I've sent them to forensics to see if they contain PMA. Great. Look at the wrappers for prints. I don't think Wakim's our dealer. I looked through Ziggy's credit-card statements. There's a ton of transactions with expensive men's stores, so I do think he's taking Ziggy for a ride. I looked at Kirk's phone to see if there was anything from around the time Tom was dumped. None of that, but a series of very interesting texts between Kirk and Mr Wakim Ahmed. What's the relationship between you and Wakim? Are you friends? Yeah. Well wishers? You say hello to each other on the street? He's my sister's boyfriend. Is that all? Yeah. Tell me, are you lovers? Do you sleep together? Mm? Are you fuck-buddies? What is it? What's the story? I've seen the texts you've been sending each other for the last two days. There's, what... Five, six, seven. There's nine pages of texts between the two of you. Um, last... "Me, too. I miss being with you so much." Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, yeah. I get it. "I'm lonely." "I want you. X, X. I wish I could tell everyone about us." We're in a relationship. That was easy. Brilliant. Yeah? Has that helped? Maybe. Really? Does Ziggy know? Who does? Does Ziggy know? No. She doesn't know. Wow. She's your sister. Yeah. I've seen photos of the two of you. You're very close. I tell my sister everything. Good for you. Why didn't you tell your sister that you're gay? My sister knows I'm gay. Why didn't you tell your sister that you're sleeping with Wakim? That you're fucking Wakim, or he's fucking you? I dunno. Look, she's gonna forget all about Wakim. She'll lose interest in no time. Last month it was Hannah. This month it's Wakim. So... She... If Wakim was actually interested in her, she would run a mile. She's been that way ever since our parents died. I get it. I'm an arsehole. I'm fucking her boyfriend. So what? Well, I just wondered, could she have known? No. Are you sure? I... I guess. What would she feel like if she did find out? She'd be humiliated. Wouldn't she? Publicly. Yeah? Yeah, I guess so. So, Wakim, talk to me. We have your phone and we have Kirk's phone, and we've got text and picture messages between the two, which pretty much confirm that you two are together. Do you have anything to say? I'm trying to find out who assaulted Kirk, so tell me about this. Tell me about the two of you. What's there to say? We just met through Ziggy, and... and it happened, didn't it? And did she know about it? I'll take that as a no. Got forensics back on those wraps. Same finger marks are present on all of the wraps. None of those marks belong to Wakim, so he's not our dealer. Only thing he was hiding, the fact that he had a boyfriend. Charlie! I know it's really boring. Can you trawl through all the CCTV from the club? I want you to track what happened to Tom and Ziggy through the evening, OK? Found me something on Tom and Ziggy? Nothing on Tom, but I've still got seven cameras to go through. That lady in a white top is Hannah going into the toilet, and in a minute, Ziggy Hawthorne also comes out of that main door onto the stairs. Come on... Is that the main bit of the club? This is the stairway that goes down. Ziggy goes into the loo. And they're in there... Let me fast-forward it. They're in there for... Here we go. Right. They come out, and have a massive all-out barney on the stairs. Yeah. OK. They're talking about something. It's pretty heated. Ziggy looks furious. It looks more like she's having a go at her than anything else. Did Hannah mention anything about it? No, absolutely nothing. What did you two row about, Hannah? Well, basically, I... I told her that night what I found out about Kirk and Wakim. Well, how did you find out? I saw them. We were all having pre-drinks in the office. Ziggy likes to have it as a sort of unofficial VIP area. And we were all having drinks, and me and Ziggy started to go for a dance, and I forgot my cigarettes. So when I went back up to the office, I saw them kissing. I managed to get a picture of it. When did this happen? Um, about a week ago. So you knew for a week, and you didn't tell Ziggy until last night? I had to, because there was such bad tension in the group. I can't... I can't just... be normal with someone when I know they're lying to my best friend. And he didn't know I knew about it, but there was just... I just... I just couldn't deal with him being there and lying like that. So obviously he left, and Ziggy was really upset with me, because that basically was why there was a tension, and she thought something was going on. Between you and Wakim? Yeah. So we went to the toilets, and she was just in such a state. And I tried to show her the photo, but she was having none of it. I said, "I'll text it to you." "You can look at it now or look at it later." Yeah, and she just flipped out. The PMA was kicking in, and she just kicked off. That's when she started to get a bit... OK. Yeah. Er, right. Since you've been in Kirk's office, I'll need your fingerprints for elimination purposes. Look, if there's any possibility at all, I'd love to be able to see Ziggy. I know, obviously, at the moment... You'll have to ask the nursing staff at the hospital. Give them a call. I need to take your fingerprints, so just give me a sec and I'll bring the kit. I've been through Ziggy's deleted text messages. Hannah sent her that photo two minutes after their argument. She told me she sent it while they were still in the toilet. So either she's got her timings wrong, which isn't really plausible, or they argued about something else. The drug wraps. We got a match on the prints. Hannah's the dealer. Let's go talk to her. I just let her go. What? I just let her go. We got her? Brilliant. Thank you. Thank you. She left the building in a hurry ten minutes ago. Her mobile signal's been picked up three streets away by a live cell site. Slow, slow. Right. Yeah. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop! Hannah Stevenson? Stop! Stop! Get away from me! I'm arresting you for conspiracy - Let go of me! Hannah! Hannah! ..something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand? Do you understand? YES! Fucking hell. Come on! OK. Gimme the bag. Gimme the bag! I got both. I got both. Come on. Got it. Why, Hannah? Why run? Fuck's sake! Where were you going in such a rush? OK. I got the door. Put the child lock on that side. In. Is she in? Yeah. Good. Let's go. Listen, I can't stay long, unfortunately, because I've got to dash down to forensics. I wanna have a quick word with them about, um... finger marks. But you'll probably save me a lot of time, because guess where we found your finger marks. So? You know the little wraps of drugs? We found your finger marks all over them. How long have you been a drug dealer? I'm not a drug dealer. No? You're being recorded. Yes, I know I'm being recorded. Microphone. CCTV. What magazines do you read? Anything, really. Like... glossies. I'm not a drug dealer. There should be no problem, then. So I'm going to go down to forensics, talk to them. I hope you're not telling me a lie... Han. These are the wrappers. Um... Put all the wrappers together, you get something that looks like a winter photo, a skiing trip, snowboarding trip. Hannah look like the kind of girl who's a snowboarder? The bar manager Guy, he said he'd taken the job after coming back from a really long snowboarding holiday. He said he spent all his student loan on it. Boss? Is that the financial report? Yeah. What you get? Right. Guy Ollerbury is paying off his debts on time and in small amounts, which is quite normal. But there is a bulk buy for aniseed oil, commonly used for relieving muscular aches and pains, but also in the manufacture of PMA. Boom-boom. Mm! I decided to ring Guy's university. Snowboarder Guy Ollerbury was "a prodigious but lazy chemistry student". Was that a direct quote? Direct quote, quotations and everything. Kicked off his course last year for stealing laboratory equipment. Hmm! Real scientist! How long have you been manufacturing controlled drugs, Guy? I will warn you, that is one of the most serious offences going. OK? The drugs that you created, the magic batch, has killed one guy, OK? Another girl is critical in hospital. She might not make it. She probably won't. Because of you. I never intended to sell it. It wasn't my idea. I made it for my personal use. It was Hannah's idea. She... Hannah wanted to sell it. It was never my idea. She wanted the... the money. Once Wakim came along, Ziggy dropped Hannah like that. You know, she used to lavish all these gifts on her, all those watches and all that. Um... Hannah missed that, and she wanted the money, and she told me it'd be a good idea to - to sell it. OK. So you've thrown, essentially, your entire life away... ..based on a good idea? What the fuck are you doing making drugs? Hannah's not like anyone else I've met. She was interested... She was interested in me, and she was funny, and she... liked me. And I probably shouldn't have listened to her, but I did. Hannah, we've got some CCTV of you from inside the club last night. When I spoke to you earlier, and I showed you that picture of... I didn't say his name, but of a guy called Tom, and you said, "No, I've never seen him before." "He didn't chat to Ziggy or me." That was a lie, wasn't it? I... Because that's you. That's him. That's you handing him something. So you have seen him before, and you have spoken to him. I don't understand why it's just me in this situation when Guy goes into the club every day and brings things in with him. He goes in every morning to bottle up, and no-one here is pointing the finger at him. He's told us that YOU brought them in. Well, then, that's not true. Is that not you handing something to Tom? Hannah, what did you and Ziggy really argue about? Because it wasn't about the text. No comment. Jesus. I... Really? I don't have anything more to say. OK. In which case, I'll tell you what I think, shall I? I think Ziggy was pissed off you were dealing drugs in her brother's club, which had been closed because of a drugs incident, which he was trying so hard to keep open, and that you, rather than sending that text as a concerned friend and "Wakim's really messing you about," you sent it to her to distract her. No? Right. Hannah... Stop wasting our time. Your fingerprints are all over the wraps. I have nothing more to say. We have you. You'll make it a lot easier for yourself if you tell the truth. I don't have anything more to say. When you're making wraps for drugs, your fingerprints, like yours are... Look here. Look at it. All over. Fiddling everywhere. You've made your point. Hm? You've made your point. You wrapped those drugs. You brought those drugs into the nightclub. Tom Yeoman is dead because of you. OK? Do you wanna change your statement? No comment. She is a dick. Yeah. One man dead, your best friend in hospital, and all you have to say is "no comment". Motive? Money. Bingo. I just got forensics back on the whisky bottle. They found blood on the glass. The bottle they found by Ziggy? Yeah, that's the one. Mr Hawthorne, there's been a development in the case. I just felt it was up to me to come down and talk to you. It appears it was your sister that assaulted you. She was the one holding the bottle. It's come to light that she knows about your relationship with Wakim. Thank you, Mr Wilson. Who's she on the phone to? Hospital. Appreciate that. Thank you. OK. Look busy. How's Ziggy? She's regained consciousness. She's suffered brain damage, serious brain damage, so prognosis isn't good. Oh... Multiple entrances and exits all along the tow paths. There's no confident way of placing where our attacker lay and hid, or whether it was spur-of-the-moment. We've got two rapes in a mile and a half radius. He had gloves on, and he really, really, really strangled me. This is sex offender and serial rapist George Callahan. Did you do it? No, I didn't do it. So, have you arrested George? People jump to conclusions because of his past, but he should be allowed to move on. We've met before. I'm Detective Sergeant Jack Weston. I'm arresting you on suspicion of rape. Are you going away somewhere? Victim's details? Her name's Diane Ackerman. Fuck. Chief Superintendent's wife's name is Diane Ackerman. Can you corroborate where you were at the time of the rape? Sadly, no, I can't.
