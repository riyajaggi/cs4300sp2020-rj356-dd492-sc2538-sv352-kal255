 Who knew repairing the station grid would involve so much sprinting? No talk. Sleep. - What the (beep)? Hey, no, no. Down. - I did it! - I updated the dog! - Down. - What does that even mean? Hey! Mm-mm. - In Medical, they encourage us to do side projects. - No! Why?! - So I took a bunch of inert carbon - and built myself a fluffy friend from scratch. - Shut up! - No! Aah! - It's supposed to look like a dog. - You know, from Earth. - Tendi,

 - please get it out of here. - Oh, of course. Come here! Come here. - Ah. She's five percent faster and six percent smarter. You know, I hand-edited - all six billion sequences. It was really fun! When did you even find time for that? Sometimes when I say that I'm going to the bathroom, I'm really recoding her DNA. This little lady's protein bonds totally accepted the Cas9 snipping without any cellular degradation. Who has malleable protein bonds? You do. - Yes, you do. - I don't get it. You could've built any life-form at all, and you did this? It just looks like a normal dog.

 That's exactly what I was going for! I'll go grab my notes so I can read you the juicy parts. You're going to love how I reorganized her mitochondria. No spoilers, but... ...it's super funny! Just to be clear, this is a normal dog, and she's messing with us. Oh, God. Not a normal dog. Wake me up if it turns into something I need to care about. - First officer's log. - An elite team from the Cerritos has been selected by Admiral Syltrack to liaise with the Pisepian agricultural colony in disputed territory. Captain Freeman, Shaxs, and myself have been enlisted to join the mission due to our expertise in the germination of rulot seeds. In our absence, the Cerritos will receive a temporary transfer of command to a visiting captain. Visiting captain? No! So lame. I figured you'd love a break from our usual guys. Sub caps never know what they're doing. They're all like, "Buffer the phase coils." And we're like, "What are you talking about?" What are you talking about? I don't want some babysitter Jellico-type hovering over us when we're already going to a bog planet, which is, like, the worst kind of planets, as far as planets go. Bogs are actually fascinating. Did you know - that the spore count can... - I don't want to know about a bog! It's a gross word for a gross place! Well, you're being very unscientific. Anyway, I'm into it. We get to rub shoulders with the visiting crew, maybe impress another captain. Oh, you're just excited to kiss a whole new butt, aren't you? Well, I wouldn't put it like that. But yes, very. Hmm... Rutherford! The visiting crew's gonna be here any minute. Hey, if I part my hair like this, do I look more promotable or less? More? Less? More? Less? - Yeah, sure. - You didn't even look! Sorry. It's this transporter, man. I'm trying to make it go .07 seconds faster. Mariner wouldn't help me test it. She said she wanted to wait until I ironed out the kinks. But how am I supposed to do that if nobody's gonna - help me test it? - Ooh! I'll do it. I can tell the new captain that, in my spare time, - I enjoy improving efficiency. - Okay, cool. I'll just transport you back and forth super quick. Real easy. Okay. Beam me up. I mean, Boim me up. You know what I'm saying. Okeydokey! That was, like, half a second faster than normal! I can't believe it's working. Ooh, ooh, ooh! Run me through it again! Do it again! Do it again! - Uh... - Aw, man. - I thought I solved this. - What?! Sorry, it's just the last part of the transporter process! It can be a bit sticky! Sticky?! Am I gonna die?! No, no! You're just off by, like, one millicochrane! - It's just cosmetic! - What's that noise?! Is that me?! You hardly notice it! You got to fix me before the visiting crew gets here! - I can't look like this! - What?! Oh, well, here we go. Babysitter time in three, two, one... Amina? There she is! Are you surprised? Oh, my gosh. I thought you were on the Oakland. Eh, couldn't pass up a water filtration repair. This is crazy! Wait, and you're a freakin' captain now? Get those title bumps, girl. Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal. I've even got a team. Warren, Prachett, Durga, this is my old friend I was telling you about. Captain Ramsey... speaks fondly of your time at the Academy. Oh, boy. What'd she tell you? That when it comes to boots-on-the-ground planetary action, you're the best. And you look damn good doing it. Curious that you're still an ensign. Ensign Boimler reporting for duty! Dude! What is wrong with you?! Nothing! I'm just phasing! No biggie! Disagree! It's kind of a biggie! Ensign, report to sickbay! But that's for sick people! - Now! - Aw. How long is this going to last?! How am I supposed to know?! You look like a goddamn science project! Then... ow! why are you still taking samples?! I figured it out! All right. Boimler's back, baby! Time to kiss some visiting butt. Wait, I'm still all phase-y. Yeah. But you're not making the sound anymore, which was the worst part, right? Oh, yeah. That was terrible. I'm literally hard to look at. I mean, what if... what if... Nobody wants a sparkly cap'n! Oh, all right, all right. Calm down. I already alerted Division 14. The time travel police? No! D-14 handles unsolvable space illnesses and science mysteries. And they can make me a real boy again? They've got this great medical spa on Endicronimas V. En... Endicron... Everyone just calls it "The Farm." You'll be pampered and tended to like a precious gem. You and Mr. Whatever The Hell That Thing Is over there. Don't worry, The Dog. I won't let them hurt you. Wait, you named it "The Dog"? Of course. Why wouldn't I? She's a totally normal dog. Mm, I'm starting to think you know more about DNA - than you do about dogs. - We don't have any on Orion. - We're really missing out. Dogs are great. Aw, look at you. You're just a cute little cinnamon roll. Yes, you are! Visiting captain's log. Stardate 57752.6. The Cerritos is en route to the planet Khwopa to... perform a repair of their water filtration system. Once completed, we will... rendezvous with the USS Rubidoux. End log. Will you stop it? Sorry, I just love captains' trinkets, you know? Come on. Give me the dirt. Have you seen Ransom's photon torpedo? Barf! No! Disgusting. No, for real, that is big barf. So, how long do we have you? I mean, it's gonna take a while to catch you up on all the crazy stuff I've been up to. Yeah. That's why I want you at my side. Getting your perspective on the Cerritos crew would be invaluable. I mean, come on, nobody likes a babysitter captain. Babysitter captain? What? I don't even know what that is. - What? - So, what do you say? Want to be my first officer? Oh! Of course! You've got the dream team. It's about time this bridge had a kickass crew. I mean, the usual guys are fine, but they're kind of... eh. Oh, wait, are... Wait, are you kidding? No, you're kidding, right? - I'm not kidding! - Then yes! All right. Let's do this... Number One. Greetings. I am the Division 14 medical specialist. Aw, thank you. I'm Tendi, and this is my dog, The Dog. And let the record show we're here under protest. I must warn you, stepping aboard this vessel is consent to be surrounded by dark abnormalities and the clinically obscene. Uh, how long will it take to get to the spa? I wasn't sure how many books to bring. Do not trouble yourself with the journey. The Farm cures all. So, we were surrounded by four Borg, right? And nobody ever talks about this, but they smell like old trash bags. What? Four? How'd you get out? It required unorthodox tactics. Durga kicked their butts with Vulcan jujitsu. Yeah, well, this one time, Ramsey and I stole Professor Rubichik's old, special car and drove it into the bay. It was hilarious. He was so pissed. I love Saul Rubichek. He was my mentor at the Academy. That car was his life. - I spoke at his funeral. - Uh, well, that was a long time ago. I still do stuff like that all the time. Last week, I put a scorpion in Ransom's bed. It was bad. He almost died. Do you often disrupt missions? No, I mean, I do regular Starfleet stuff, too. Everyone ready? Let's roll out. Reports indicate that first contact here was a little tricky. The bogs didn't help. Let's see if we can get ahold of the local authorities. Copy that. Hey, are you on a different mission, or are you coming with us? Oh. Uh, sorry. Right. I'll just, uh... When we're done here, you'll be back to enjoying crystal clear water, King Phibeas. We osmose our most brackish gratitude. So, uh, you and Ramsey are pretty tight, huh? How'd you guys meet? I do not believe that information has any bearing on our current objective. Damn, Durga. I was just making chitchat. Critical overpressure. One of the cascade valves must be jammed open! We've got 30 seconds till the whole system blows! Mariner, the tricorders. Um, uh, I... You know, I think I left them in the transporter room. Try clearing it with a subsonic pulse. I must have grabbed the wrong crate. I-I left all our tricorders back on the Cerritos. Which is the least useful place for them to be, First Officer Mariner. Captain Ramsey, I just wanted to take a brief pause from our covert operation to check in - on my ship. - The Cerritos and her crew have performed admirably, Captain Freeman. We've repaired the waste pipe on Khwopa and are waiting on the Rubidoux. Very good. I've got to go. These rulot seeds are highly volatile. I may be called to plant them at any moment. Godspeed, Captain. Okay, so, they might plant seeds? Well, sounds like they're on a very important mission. Strange. The Rubidoux should have arrived by now. Well, Captain Dayton isn't exactly punctual, but we may as well follow up. Initiate long-range scan. Mariner, - if you don't mind? - Oh! Me. Right. Sure thing. Uh, here we go. Ah! Uh, s-sorry! Hold on. Uh... Perhaps Mariner isn't as apt as you recall. Nobody move! Just wait. It'll... - It'll tire itself out. - Hey. - Just breathe. You've got this. - Uh... Huh. Wow, I never knew there were this many accidents in Starfleet. Which is exactly why Division 14 exists: to hide the mistakes Starfleet would like to ignore. - Oh, well, that doesn't sound very Starfleety. - The admirals wouldn't want to jeopardize the allegiance of their officers by forcing them to work alongside a man whose body is equal parts accelerated growth and reverse aging. That's right. Stare at me. - I-I wasn't s-staring. - The freak infected by an alien horse bite, doomed to live out his days as half a rascal. Everyone would rather avert their gaze instead of curing us. We're inconvenient. But aren't there specialists who specialize in this? Tell that to Ensign Jenna, exposed to delta radiation. Or Ellis and Sanderson. Neutrino field transporter accident. - We have two of everything. - Almost everything. And Anthony. Hi, Anthony. Did it used to be a man? Yeah, that's what we're assuming. Don't worry, The Dog. You don't belong here with these freaks. I'll break you out first chance I get. Come on, you're making it sound worse than it is. I mean, we're all going to a resort planet with gentle nurses and whatnot. It's gonna be great. The Farm? You really think they're taking us to a paradise planet? Wait, yeah. I... Then where are we going? Nowhere. We've been here for months. This is The Farm! It's the Rubidoux, Captain. All systems appear to be off-line. I told Dayton to get her energy coils replaced last month. Looks like I was right. If power's out, they're probably holed up in a safe room, waiting for rescue, just like last time. Durga, Mariner, Warren, you're with me. Let's give them a jump. Power has been interrupted in engineering. Durga, get the main systems back on line. Mariner and I will figure out where the crew is holed up. Should be a simple repair for me, Captain. Check in every 15 minutes. Oh, and someone make sure to get a picture of me and Captain Dayton when she thanks me for saving her ass again. Sorry. Uh, new boots. Wait is going on with you? I really need you to step it up. Sorry. Yeah, no, I'll do better. You know, it's these darn boots. These boots are, like... I got... I... Well, I wanted to get, - like, a taller boot. - Stop with the boots! What's up, girl? What's wrong? You... You want walkies? Oh, come on. Let's go. Listen up. There's a shift change at 0200. It's our chance to take the ship. You're talking about a mutiny. Exactly. We'll find our own planet where we won't be treated like failed science experiments. Tonight, freaks fight back! Freaks fight back! Freaks fight back! Brother, freaks united are freaks no more. Say it with me. Freaks fight back! Yeah. Freaks fight back. Freaks fight back! Freaks fight back! Freaks fight back! ...is what they were all chanting. We were all doing it in unison. Mutiny? On my ship? How dare they! Sir, they just want more information. I think if we all sat down in a conference room and talked it out... If those freaks think they can mutiny, they're in for a rude awakening. No, no, no! The only reason I told you is so nobody gets hurt. We're all Starfleet. We have to follow the rules. - I am the rules. - Wait! We can talk this out! Sir! Don't tell them I tattled! Don't tell them I tattled! Um, hello? Hello, Rubidoux people? Hello? Oh, where are these guys? How do you do this every day? It is so boring. You used to love space mysteries. Yeah. I used to be dumb. That's one way to look at it. - What does that mean? - I expected to be working with the capable Starfleet badass I knew at the Academy, not whatever you are now. Yeah, and I expected to be working with my fun friend, - not a total... - Hold it. These doors have been manually sealed. - I don't want to die. - Stand down. We're Starfleet. - I don't want to die. I don't want to die. - Captain Dayton. Whoa, Captain, Captain, you're gonna be okay. No! That thing is still out there! There's nothing outside except the Cerritos. You don't understand! We're inside of it! It's time. Let's shake the ship! - What do you think you're doing? - Uh... nothing. Mutiny makes you traitors! Mutiny? No, these are just props that we're using for our... our musical, right, guys? Stop lying! Boimler told me everything! Brad Boimler. - Ooh, no, no, no. - Right there... Brad Boimler. Boimler, what the hell?! Freaks fight back? From now on, everyone is confined to their quarters. I suggest you spend the time alone, thinking about how to be more like Brad. Wait, wait, wait. I have no idea how he found out, guys. - That's crazy. - Get the rat! - Get him! - Guys, no. Help! So many freaks! We shut down systems because it feeds on electricity. Durga, do not restore power. Durga, Durga... restore power. Captain, artificial gravity is coming back on line. What the hell?! Oh, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How big is this thing? All right, everyone with me. We need to stay calm. Hallway, now! Ramsey to Cerritos. Prepare for emergency transport. Damn thing must be blocking signals. I don't want to die in space! I don't want to die in space! - We're all gonna... - Pick her up. We have to get to the bridge. That's where we beamed in. - There's a good chance we can still get a signal out. - Ugh. Where has this Mariner been all day? - I don't know what you're talking about. - No, no, no, no. Something's going on here. Been non-stop screwing up, then suddenly, you're back to taking charge and punching out captains and... Wait a minute. Maybe let's talk, like, after the giant space emergency. You were taking a dive, weren't you? You figured out I was gonna offer you a spot on the Oakland. Yeah, well, maybe I didn't want my best friend trying to trick me into a job I didn't want. - You ever think of that? - Ugh! We all thought you'd be the first captain from our class. You got the best grades, you kept us all on track. Now it seems like you don't even like Starfleet. You used to do whatever you wanted whenever you wanted. Now you got to check in with Durga every five minutes. Because I love leading a team that puts their trust in me. Fine, but I don't love that everyone's always screaming at me to rank up and take charge. Why can't I just be a super great ensign? Look, how about you stop pretending to be a, and I'll stop trying to recruit you, - and we can go save these people? - Deal! Got you. A rat trapped in an airlock. That sounds about right. Any last words? Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me! I'm just a freak like you, see? It wore off! I'm not a freak anymore! Hey, would you look at that! Great! You're normal now. Enjoy your walk in space. Wait. Why is the air not being forced from my lungs? The Farm! It's real? Isn't it beautiful? The missions might be long, but it's worth it every time we get back. Ooh! Do I have egg on my face. Sir, I'm sorry for the whole... - mutiny thing. - I get it. The Farm does seem unbelievable. No, I'm sorry I reacted the way I did. We should have just talked it out. Which is what I said we should do! Next time, we'll avoid a mutiny before it happens. Maybe paint the ship some friendlier colors, turn on some lights so it isn't so creepy. Enjoy your path to recovery, my friends. Oh, it's just the way I laugh. This is where we have to say goodbye. I never wanted to leave you. You're not a freak. You're just a good dog. I will never give up trying to get you back home. Tendi, you have been an exemplary creator. But do not cry. I like it here! There's far more space to run and many fascinating things upon which to urinate. Oh, wow. I'm so glad you're happy! Well, The Dog, then I guess this is goodbye. Farewell, Tendi. May the suns shine upon you. Wait. You knew she could talk and walk? Yeah, of course she can talk. She's a dog. - Normal dogs don't do any of that stuff. - They don't? Wait. But normal dogs hover and spit lightning, right? - No, none of that! - Oh! Well, then this is starting to make a lot more sense. Hey, you are a freak. I know! I just didn't want you to worry. Oh, she's such a good girl. Oh, we call dibs on this cutie. - Oh. - No, he shouldn't even be here. He's not a freak anymore. - You're not? - I, uh, I have acid reflux. That's kind of freakish. Wait, wait, wait! No. Not today, snot! Durga, report. There's some sort of alien entity inside the ship. - Oh, you think? - Okay, everybody, we're gonna get you out of here. - Warren, beam us out of here. - I'm trying. There's too many. - We-we won't have time. - Rutherford! We need your transporter thing up and running now! It made Boimler weird! Boim us out of here! - Hold on! - Rutherford! Come on, baby. Give Rutherford the juice! Oh, man, I knew you could do it, Ruthy! Why are we still in phase? Ah, it's just cosmetic. It's just cosmetic. Captain's log. The evacuation of the U.S.S. Rubidoux was a success, thanks to the quick thinking of the Cerritos crew. While the exact classification of this space entity eludes us, we believe it to be peaceful, in search of a home. You're cured? I mean, see? I knew you'd be fine. Listen, you got to mess me up again. Not permanently, but maybe, like, a nice two-week freak. I have been tinkering with some ancient plasmas. Aw. Good afternoon. I'm Tendi. How are you today? Ugh. Ugh! Ugh! She licked me. What a weirdo! Would you look at that? Nothing like a big, crazy alien to remind you why "space explorer" is such a great gig. Yeah, it's the best. Well, Starfleet isn't perfect, but my offer still stands. If you want a chance to lead by example, I'd have your back. Yeah, if I was gonna rank up for anyone, it would be you, but, you know, I still have some stuff to figure out while I'm lower decks, about who I want to be. Like, maybe I'll buckle down and become a captain. Maybe I won't. Probably won't. - I just need time to find me. - I know you will. Well, well, well, beautiful Captain Ramsey. I'd love to buy you a drink. Oh. Sorry, Ransom. Instincts kicked in. I'll take a pass on that drink. Good one, Ramsey. That's our thing. She's kidding. Chirp.
