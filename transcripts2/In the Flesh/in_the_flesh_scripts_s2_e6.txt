 In the Flesh (2013–2014): Season 2, Episode 6 - Episode #2.6 - full transcript 
 Kieren awaits transfer to Norfolk but, with Simon returning to lead his followers in a Second Rising, Maxine allows Gary to force Kieren to help find him. At the village fete it is noticed that Amy is transforming into a human by her ability to eat solid foods and the militant PDS sufferers have a stand-off in the graveyard against Jem and her rabid hunters. Kieren's father Steve stops Jem from killing her brother but an increasingly deranged Maxine, whose brother Danny was slain, announces that she wants a Second Rising to revive him and murders Amy, who is the true first risen. She demands the death of all PDS sufferers in Roarton but this horrifies the villagers and, as she is taken to an asylum, an uneasy truce occurs between the villagers and the Partially Dead with Kieren and Simon reconciled.

 Did you enjoy your time at the treatment centre? Cos that's where you're headed if you don't confess. I didn't do it! I feel it again! I'm not turning rabid. - You're scared of me? - I don't even recognise you any more. This is who I am. DOORBELL RINGS I can't look at him when he's like that. Jesus Christ. What you doing? I'm looking for Simon. Have you seen him?

 That's the first person you saw rise from their grave? It's Simon. I'm ready to follow him. JULIAN: It has to be done, Simon. You must sacrifice the First Risen on the 12th hour of the 12th day of the 12th month. The First Risen must be destroyed. Only then can the second resurrection occur. "Morning Has Broken" by Cat Stevens ♪ Morning has broken ♪ ♪ Like the first morning... ♪ Hello. I'll be your waitress today. I'm a fully compliant PDS sufferer. I have been administered Neurotriptyline in the last 24 hours and will not enter a rabid state. Oh. Ha-ha. That's good to know.

 Tea or coffee? Er... coffee, thanks. ♪ ... Praise for the springing... ♪ Don't fancy anything? Still got three hours ahead of us till we reach Roarton. I'm not a breakfast person. Oh, it's the most important meal of the day. You're going to need it. Collections never go easy. Always put up a fight. I don't mind driving the rest of the way. All right, it's your funeral. ♪ ... Where his feet pass... ♪ MAN ON RADIO: ... to 12th December, and you all know what that means. Roarton Village's winter fête extravaganza is upon us. What's going on, Dad? Me and your mum have come to a decision. - A decision? - Mm. Yeah, we think it's best, all things considered, to let the council, you know, do what they're going to do. You... you're letting them send me back to Norfolk? Going back to t'treatment centre might be just what the doctor ordered. KIEREN SNORTS They're trained up to handle situations like this. They'll be able to help you get back to your normal self. This is my normal self. Hm. It's time for a professional opinion. So, you're... you're washing your hands of me? No. We're doing what we believe is in your best interests. Locking me in my bedroom until the men in white coats come along and drag me away? That... that's in my best interests? Well, I hope they won't have to drag you away. Can I call Amy, at least? She's part of the crowd that's been having a bad influence on you. Well, I need to speak to her, Dad. Something's not right. I'm worried about her, Dad. You can come down for your shot after breakfast, ok? Dad! KNOCKING Dad! Dad. KNOCKS GASPS GASPS SCREAMING KNOCKING ON DOOR Jem? You getting ready to beat the bounds? Yeah. What's happening to me? I'm not entirely sure, Amy. It seems like your body's waking up, or coming alive, or something like that. Why me? I don't know. - Maybe you're special. - Special? My nan always said I was special, but I just figured that's something all nans say. Philip, I'm freaking out. Hey. Hey, hey. It's fine. It's all right. You're all right. Maybe we should get some proper medical advice on this. See Dr Russo. What do you think? No, bad idea. What do you think would happen if we told Dr Russo I was... changing? Do you think he'd just pat me on the back, give me a lolly and send me on my way? He'd call the treatment centre, and then they'd cart me off to experiment on. You know what the living are like. You know what some of the living are like. Got to keep this under our hats. Ok. - We can't just stay here. - Why? We'll die of hypothermia. You're cold? Aren't you? I'm freezing. Listen, listen. My teeth are chattering. Mum, don't let them take me back. It's for the best, Kier, all things considered. Not if they take me back as a non-compliant... CLICK Look, Dad, I'm not going to do anything stupid, ok? You've said that before, then it all goes horribly wrong. No. Spending a bit of time in Norfolk will do you a tonne of good. They know how to take care of you there, don't they, Sue? Open your eyes! You know what's going to happen to me if they take me back to the treatment centre. I'm running late. Are you coming to the fête, Steve? - I've said I'll take Jem to t'march. - Ok, then. Kier, we'll be back later to see you off. Oh. All right, then. All right, Kier, back to your room. Can I take this up with me, Dad? Parish newsletter? Reading material. For He so loved the world, that He gave His one and only Son. Whoever shall believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Give me the courage to do my duty, to protect and defend my community from all harm. So help me God. Simon? Yeah? When the dead rise today, what will they be like? The Second Risen will be... Well, they're going to change things. They're going to bring an end to the suffering and the persecution. After the second Rising, we ain't going to be treated like dirt any more. Can we help you do it, Simon? I've got to do this alone. - Well, what should we do? - Prepare. OTHERS MURMUR Lord, let the disciple complete his mission today. Miss Martin. I'm ready. Ready? To stop the threat. Just say the word. Who's the threat? The Irish rotter. The ULA extremist. Leave it alone, Captain. What you saying? He's planning an attack, Miss Martin. Where's your proof? Proof? You said it yourself. You got me to follow him and... And nothing came of it. No, that's not right. Something did come of it. He went to that hotel. He met that other dead 'un. I lifted the evidence off him. It all adds up. He's going to pounce any minute if I don't track him down and... You are not thinking straight, Captain. He is not a threat. Understand? I am thinking straight. That Irish rotter needs to be stopped. Go home, Gary. That's an order. Don't worry, Jem. This is the last time you have to see me. Jem, can you at least look at me? LOCK CLICKS DOG BARKS KNOCKS Open up! Open this bloody door or I'll bust it through! OLIVER: God's own country. Norfolk? Under four hours? That is impressive. Yeah, it's quite the drive. Her hands are still set at ten to two. Ha! Is there a doctor in the house? DR RUSSO LAUGHS Hopefully, we won't be making multiple trips. Well, sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But I'm afraid it's just not possible. I'd have told you that over the phone, if you'd have called. Yeah, you see, Tom... Can I call you Tom? You see, Tom, the tests you sent through were very interesting, but it's not just us who needs to know. It's Halperin & Weston. Bit of a behemoth, bit of a juggernaut. Big company. Don't need to remind me of that. Once the old ball starts rolling at Norfolk, it's nigh on impossible to stop the damn thing. You studied at Norfolk, correct? I had the privilege. Well, Tom, you know, if you could do us the privilege of getting that address, that would be a massive help. I'm sorry. I don't have the address. - Really? - In between addresses, apparently. And... and the medical records would state that, would they? If you were to show them to us, which you're not going to do. Like I said, I can't show you a patient's medical records. Hm. Sorry. Liked to have been of more help. What can you do? You don't know where Amy Dyer lives. Do you? Afraid not. We'll be in touch... Tom. Are you still going to like me? - What? - Now I'm, er... warming up? You've only known me a bit deadly. You might not like me heated up. Amy. I'd like you cold. I'd like you hot. I'd even like you tepid. SHE LAUGHS You're still you, dead or alive. All right? What's wrong? That way's the perimeter fence. Today's the Beating of the Bounds march. Best avoid it. Dad, what's going to happen to Kier? He's going to go back to the treatment centre for a bit and they're going to help him get back to his old self. They're not going to lock him up and do things to him, are they? No. Where did you get that idea? He'll be all right. Norfolk's a nice place to be. Off to beat the bounds. He's in his room. Got you. LOW CHATTER Not bad. Amy, the march ends here. We won't be long. I just want to touch more things. You've got your ticket, haven't you? Yeah. I suppose t'council were good for something. Mrs Lamb. Councillor. Or should I say ex-councillor? Congratulations on your nomination to the parish council. It's about time this village were represented by God-fearing folk, instead of just a bunch of flailing wimps and filthy perverts. Have a nice day. Hold your horses! She's not valid. - I gave you my ticket. - You gave me a ticket. Where's hers? Mrs Lamb, if you check the fine print on the fête charter, a charter I helped draft while I was in office, you'll see a clause, and in that clause it states, that all ticket holders to the winter fête are entitled to a plus-one. Amy Dyer's my plus-one. I can assure you, Councillor Elect, she is valid. Beating the bounds is an ancient tradition here in Roarton. - I'm thrilled to see people turn out. - Are all these really necessary? - I think everyone's going overboard. - I'm thrilled to announce the completion, under budget and on time, of Roarton's new perimeter fence. We couldn't have achieved this construction without the parish council adopting new policies that will guarantee the safety of this community for generations to come. - We couldn't have done it without you, Miss Martin. - Today isn't about me. It's about all of us, embarking on a new beginning, a new dawn, protected, proud and incorruptible. Now... I should cut this ribbon so we can get a move on, eh? Anyone got a sharp implement I can use? LAUGHTER Here you are, missus. Thank you. So, let the march commence! MILITARY DRUMBEAT Come on, then. Here comes dickhead. ENGINE OFF - 'Ey up. - 'Ey up. - Go on, then. Be off with you. - What? I'm relieving you of your post, you tart. I'm supposed to be on guard duty all day. I've fiddled it. Thought you could do with t'day off. Go to t'fête. Have a mulled wine on me. Go on, then, before I see sense. Ta, Gaz. You're all right. Cheers, pal. You going somewhere, dry rot? KIEREN GRUNTS Where's Simon? GRUNTS - Where is he? - I don't know. GRUNTS Bullshit. You and lover boy are like that. I haven't seen him for days, Gary. You know he's planning an attack, don't you? No. He fucking is. Today. I've sussed it out. Is this the code for where he's going to do it? "The dead shall rise again incorruptible." It's a Bible quote. I know that, you cheeky bastard. You know, all of you think I'm just some dumb grunt, don't you? I don't think you're dumb, Gary. I just think you're like everyone else around here, paranoid and delusional. Is it any wonder with you ghouls walking about? You know, my pap used to say there were no such thing as monsters. Then you horror shows turn up and start tearing the world apart. And who's expected to deal with it, eh? Me, that's who. You think I wanted to fight? Do you think I wanted to see the things I saw? You get off on all that shit, Gary. I were ready to settle down before you fucking dead-heads turn up. Then me and your sister had to strap on the brass and take care of business. Cos if we didn't, people died. In our arms, no less. GARY PANTS That's not going to happen again. I won't allow it. So, I'm going to ask you for the last time. Where's that Irish rotter? MILITARY DRUMBEAT Lieutenant. Think you can handle leading the march the rest of the way? But shouldn't the Captain lead? Well, he's not here, is he? Falls to you to take the reins. ♪ "The Family Of Man" by The Spinners ♪ ♪ It's a name every man should be proud he owns ♪ ♪ It's the family of man ♪ ♪ Keeps growing ♪ ♪ The family of man ♪ ♪ Keeps sowing ♪ ♪ The seeds of a new life... ♪ - Just one toffee apple, please. - I'll just get your change. - All right, Sue? - Oh. Hi, Shirley. You all right? Aye, suppose. Philip's got me sprouting ulcers. - Is he giving you a hard time? - Well, you know what they're like. They get to a certain age, they become unrecognisable. How's Kieren holding up? Yeah. He's, er... being a bit difficult. Disgusting what the council's threatening to do with him. Good job he's got you to fight his corner. ♪ ... The miner in the Rhondda ♪ ♪ The coolie in Peking... ♪ Your Philip looks like he's having a good time. Is that Amy Dyer? What's she doing with that toffee apple? Eating it. ♪ ... So, let's bridge the oceans and declare... ♪ Oh, Jesus Christ. No-one's planning anything, Gary! Yeah, right(!) And I play for United(!) What is wrong with you?! If Jem could see you now. My God! You're a mess. You're coming apart at the seams. Fuck me. Blue Oblivion. It's you. It's been you all along. Yeah, those aren't mine. I found them at the bungalow. Hiding in plain sight. Where were you planning on taking 'em? Legion? Village hall? Fête? Going to go rabid in front of a bunch of kiddies, are you? Sick bastard! You may as well start singing now, cos you're fucked! I'm already on my way back to the treatment centre. There's nothing you can threaten me with. Treatment centre? Dead-head holiday camp, more like. Oh, no, you're not getting off that easy, rotter. You want to go rabid? All right, let's go rabid. FOLLOWERS: Rise. Rise. Rise. Rise. MUSIC PLAYING LAUGHS Ooh. Got the likeness down pat. Next you can paint a scarlet letter on that one's chest.

I'm good, thanks, Mrs Wilson. You sure you're all right, sweetheart? I... I saw you munching on a toffee apple just now. Oh. Oh, yeah. I forgot. I'm PDS. Course. I don't eat. Whoops. Oh, dear.

He shouldn't have been... He fell. All the... the terrible things we've done can be wiped clean. A fresh start. No more grief. No more guilt. And all that needs to happen is the second Rising. MURMURING I know I said I didn't want another one but it won't be like the first Rising. The second Rising will bring back the good and... and righteous.

We were at the graveyard and Miss Martin comes up to us - and says something about Amy being the first and the last. - Oh!

You're my best dead friend for ever. Ok? Forever. That is... that is non-negotiable. Oh! Oh! - She's lost too much blood. - You've got to do something. Her pupils have changed. What are you doing?

Go where? Away from here. It's not safe, Kieren. I can't leave. - Isn't leaving what you wanted to do? - Yeah, it was. Amy once asked me how many miles I'd have to go before I could be ok with myself. I thought I'd have to go around the whole world. And I don't think that any more. I'm ok here. Ok. CLEARS THROAT Simon. I wanted to thank you. - Thank me? - You saved Kier's life. Reflex. Have you got somewhere to stay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm staying up at Amy's bungalow at the moment, so...
