 Thanks for inviting me out, Frankie. Between work and studying, I've been a bit of a hermit lately. It's the final push. Yep. And now that the chemistry exam's done, it's just pathology and ethics left. You are gonna kill pathology! Hahaha! Very funny! - I try. - Haha! Ethics is a real problem though. There's just all this legal jargon. It's like I'm reading a foreign language. You're gonna be out of the classroom and into the clinic

 - in no time. - Yeah, I guess. You guess? Flo, all you ever talk about is wanting to be a doctor. It's just I'm so used to cadavers. What if I'm not good with patients who are, you know, alive. You are wonderful with people. It's gonna be - absolutely fine. - Frankie! Look. What do we do? We stay very, very calm. Come on. Whatever it is, it's not worth it. Get away from me or I'll jump! OK, look. There's gotta be something we can do or someone we can call. There isn't anything anyone can do. I've got nothing left.

 Whatever's down there isn't worth jumping for. You don't understand. Well, then help us to. Someone is trying to ruin my life. So you thought you'd help them by jumping off a bridge? I can't take it anymore. Uh-uh, the mishaps were one thing, but now! - Now what? - What do you do about the mis-shipments? You buy the factory, that's just smart business sense. But, no! Someone tries to ruin that for me too! Who? Who does? If I knew that, do you think I'd be up here? Well, if that's what you want, she can definitely help. Meet Frankie Drake, the best P.I. in the city. I've already been through all this with the Pinkertons and the police. It's no use. Just leave me alone. Look, I can help you. - I promise I can help. - Be careful. OK. Oh! Ah! - Flo! Flo! - Come on. Careful. OK. - You saved my life. - You're welcome. You find the jerk who's trying to ruin my life, and then maybe I'll thank you. I've always wanted to come to this place. The stuff in here cracks me up! - Oh! - Hahahaha! I didn't know you liked this kind of stuff! Oh, you should blame my father. He used to play - tricks on my mom all the time. - Look at that, there's still things we don't know about each other. - Is that him? - Yep. That's Ernie Penny. Ah! You're here, thank goodness! I-I've come up with a list of everything that's gone wrong in the last month. Mr. Penny. This is my associate, Trudy Clarke. Hi. Nice to meet you. You'll see that the saboteur has been involved in every aspect of my life. "Mis-shipments, incorrect orders, - staffing problems..." - Personal attacks are on the other side. Flip it over. You have been stood up on several dates? Multiple occasions, yes. There's noise complaints at your rooming house. Several of them, yes. What about this deal that fell through? I was set to buy Shipman's Toy Factory for a song! I had - papers drawn up and everything! - And then? And then some other bidder swooped in and bested my offer! Yesterday! It does sound like a string of bad luck, but are you sure...? - I'm here about the roaches! - The what?! Now, it could take a few sessions... ...if the infestation is as bad as you said it was - on the phone. - No, no, no, no. I assure you, I have never spoken to you, or any other exterminator - for that matter. - Oh, I got it right here. "Ernie Penny, Penny and Pound Emporium." Just scram! Shoo! Go! OK, well you still owe me for the call. You still think that it's all bad luck? - OK, let's just start with THE BASICS HERE: can you think of anyone who would want to do all of this to you? Yes. Amos Pound. - As in Penny and Pound? - The one and the same. - Amos used to be my partner. - Where is he now? Your guess is as good as mine. He quit in a huff and I haven't heard from him since. He... he didn't even clean out his desk. Excuse me. Ahoy hoy. Are you sure about this guy, Frankie? - I made him a promise. - Alright. What's first? Why don't you stay here and see what you find out - about this Amos Pound. - And where are you going? To see if I can find out who outbid Ernie. For the last time, I did not call an exterminator! You owe me for this. Oh, God... Another, please? Ah, sorry, what were you saying? - The sale of your factory? - Ah, right, right. Uh, I don't know what to tell you, Miss Drake. I got a better offer. Mr. Penny was under the impression that no one else knew - that the factory was for sale. - I guess someone found out. - Don't you find that a little odd? - A sale is a sale. Can you at least tell me who bought it? - I... I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? The buyer wanted to remain anonymous. The whole thing was handled over the telephone with a secretary. Now, you are welcome to stay and help me toast my retirement, but I am done talking about toys. Purchase orders, utility bill... Hello. Yes, City Hall, please. Records department. - Bill Peters speaking. - Bill, hi. It's me. Can we reschedule lunch? Something's come up at work. Of course. Everything OK? Ah, everything's fine. Just usual work excitement. How about tomorrow night? Get a drink at Jelly's? Yeah, that sounds really great to me. I'm sick and tired of this, Mr. Penny. - Uh, who is this? - If you're gonna be on the phone this long, get a private line! Sir, I'm sorry. This isn't... Don't "sorry" me! Have some consideration! I'll take that as my cue to go. - See you tomorrow night? - Sounds good. "If, in the course of treating a patient, "you come to learn confidential information "that may affect the well-being of others, do you have the obligation to report?" I don't know. Maybe? Flo, you have to take this seriously. I am! It's just all so theoretical. How you know the right thing to do unless you're actually in the situation? Oh, I guess that's a good point. - Hmm. - OK. "If two doctors have competing ideas..." Thank you for coming by, Mr. Pound. - What can I help you with? - Well... ...your ex-partner believes someone is trying to ruin his life. Ernie always had an overactive imagination. So you're denying having any involvement with his recent troubles? - A hundred percent. - Even though the split was acrimonious? Everything with Ernie is acrimonious. It's why I left. Are you sure it's not because you got a better offer? - It helped. - He said the two of you were thinking about buying Shipman's toy company before you left. Ernie was, yes. Did anyone know about that plan? Anyone from your new factory, maybe? Not a soul. No. Why? Well, someone outbid him yesterday. He lost the sale. Ooof! It's bad luck. But it wasn't me. - Then who? - I'd start with the ex-fiancée. OK. Ernie Penny. If I never hear that name again, it will be too soon. Is this about the ring? 'Cause if it is, you can tell him I've already sold it. No, it's not about the ring. Look, he's in quite a lot of trouble. Well, that man deserves whatever he gets. I understand you're upset, but he could lose his business. And you think I have something to do with it? We're investigating the possibility. No man who would break off an engagement over the telephone deserves a second thought, much less the energy it would take to ruin his business. Now, if you'll excuse me. OK, last one: "What parties, if any, "do you have to take into consideration "when attempting to gain informed consent from an unconscious patient?" - Frankie and Trudy! - No, Flo. - No, no, no. I mean, look! - Oh. Oh, hey, gals! Hey. - Trudy. - Frankie! Let me guess: your father's? - His prized possession. - So, how's the case going? - Oh, slowly! - The buyer wants to remain anonymous. Everything else that's happened to Ernie seems so random. That doesn't sound like much to go on. Yeah, especially when so many people have a problem with him. Really? He seemed alright. Neurotic, but alright. Tell that to his neighbour. Guy practically yelled me off the phone, ranting about how Ernie was hogging the party line. - Maybe it's the phone. - What about it? Well, that could be the connection to all of Ernie's troubles. The exterminator, he never called; the mis-shipments; the false orders. You think someone's listening in on his phone calls? It would be easy enough for someone to get all that information on him. - Yeah, but who's the someone? - There could be dozens of people on a party line. Well, we need to find out who all of them are. - Let's go! - Sorry, guys. OK. Alright. Nice seeing you. Absolutely not! Our phone records are strictly confidential. Of course, I completely understand. But surely you could make an exception just this once? That sort of thing won't work on me, Miss Drake. - Come back with a warrant! - Hi, mister. I'll take you through. Thank you. Have a nice day. - So what now? - Well, normally I would say we come back after hours, but the phone exchange is open around the clock. We need to get into those files. What are you thinking? I have something that might help. Good old stink bomb should do the trick. Always prepared. Oh, my gosh! What is it? Oh! I'll get the party line records; you get - the personnel files. - Mm-hmm. Back to work, ladies! Come on! Do not abandon your stations! What's he doing back in here? This place isn't gonna run itself! - Look at this. - Is it alright? The smell is becoming more tolerable! Come on, ladies! These phone calls will not answer themselves! Let's get this back to the office. Do you have another stink bomb? I thought you'd never ask. Oh! Oh, my goodness! Go, go, go! Oh! Oh! All I can smell is sulphur. Haha! I gotta hand it to Ernie: that is the best stink bomb I've ever smelled. Spoken like a true connoisseur. Well, my dad taught me well. Although he's more of a whoopee-cushion guy. So the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Oh, you think I'm bad? You should see my brothers. Jacob once put one of those on my mother's seat in church. Mildred must have been furious. Oh, she was so embarrassed we had to change congregations. Oh, no. Well, does your dad have any tips on how to get the smell out of clothes? Well, I once heard tomato juice helps. We should just throw them out. What am I gonna do with all the tomato juice I just bought? You know, I just read this article about a cocktail that is all the rage - in Paris. - Mmm... You know, I hate to admit this, but tomato juice and vodka kind of work. Mm-hm. Sometimes the French get things right. Haha! - OK. - OK, so Ernie shares a party line with nine other households and that's a lot of people to investigate. - Frankie? - It's not the party line. Someone has been tracking Ernie. Other people as well, it seems like. But how? Operators aren't allowed to listen in on phone calls. Well, allowed or not, they are. There's dates, times, what the conversations are about. So this book belongs to whoever is trying to ruin Ernie? Seems that way. Look at this: there's a page ripped out. Can you hand me that pencil? "Margaret Robinson." Is she on the personnel list? Uh... No. No Robinson unless she quit when she bought the factory? There's entries here from today. OK, so maybe Margaret Robinson's a pseudonym? Unless she changed her name. How are we going to find out which it is? We need to get in there. Alright. Well, Mr. Millard knows who we are already; there's no way he's gonna hire us on. It's not us he's gonna hire. Our operators must give a triple A performance - at all times. - "Triple A performance." OK, got it. Um, what does triple A mean exactly? They're expected to be accurate, agile and to comport themselves with an amazing attitude always. Is that all? The rest you'll learn on the job. Good luck. One of these women is responsible for driving Ernie up on that bridge. But how do we know which one? Well, if Margaret Robinson changed her name, there's - gotta be a record of it. - Hopefully, Bill can find it. Hopefully, Flo and Mary are having luck at the phone exchange. - Knock-knock. - I thought we were meeting tonight. Don't get up! Don't get up! We are. Just wanted to make use of our best inside man at city hall. Man on the inside, huh? Makes me sound so important. Oh, believe me, you are. The last record officer... - Mr. McIntyre. - He was no help at all. - And not nearly as cute. - Well, how can I refuse - you now? What do you two need? - The record of a name change. - What's the original name? - Margaret Robinson. Easy as pie. Give me five minutes. Take a seat. Hello, this is your operator. Happy birthday, grandma! Can't wait to see you. Connecting you now. I think my arms are gonna fall off. My arms are fine, it's my backside I'm worried about. Ah! Standby for Walnut 3327. Ahem! How are you two settling in? You'll get the hang of it. I'm Lilian. - I'm Flo. And this is Mary. - Hi. - Say hello, Mary. - Triple A performance, Flo. Mary, it's fine. How do you keep up with it all? Honestly, as long as you don't get pulled into the drama, you'll be great. - The drama? - On the line. Listening in on personal phone calls is the number one way operators fall behind. And the number one way they get fired. - Do a lot of operators really do that? - Oh, you would be surprised. Just plain rude if you ask me. Anyways, better get back to it. And if you have any questions at all, please feel free to ask. We operators look out for each other. Thanks, Lilian. Doesn't really narrow down our suspect pool. What's the game plan? How are we gonna root out Margaret Robinson? Uh, uh, can we talk about it on break? Yes, stand by, Adelaide 212. So... you and Bill seem to be in a good place. We're in a great place, actually. Last week, he did the sweetest thing. So, I wasn't able to find a record of a name change. - Well, thank you for looking. - However, I did find this. It's Margaret Robinson's last known address. You're the best! Jelly's tonight? I wouldn't miss it. Thanks, Bill! Hello, this is your operator. I'm gonna return this to its hiding place. Frankie said to keep an eye out in case someone comes back for it. Yes. Yes, I understand. Alright, right away. Well, I've been telling June she has to lose weight. What do you think? I think you're an idiot. - Sorry? - I always knew people were dummies, but after one hour here, that conviction has climbed to new heights. Especially men. - Ugh! - Right, Edna? You wouldn't believe the things we hear. - Ohhh... - I'm Busy. She's Edna. - Flo. - You need a break, Flo? - I never thought you'd ask. - Haha! - Can I help you? - Oh. Ah, no... I just... Well, I saw that you have such lovely penmanship. Hm. I said that we look out for one another, not spy on each other. Sorry. I... I ju... I'm sorry. I'll... I'll just... While we are on the subject of clueless males, - I have a confession to make. - Oh? Don't tell anyone, but I was fired from my last job for messing with a coworker. I worked in a medical office. I had this intern, Bart. Ugh! He drove me crazy. And one day, I just couldn't take it anymore. - What did you do? - I started with silly stuff. You know, like, um, moving his equipment when he wasn't watching or cancelling meetings, stuff like that, but then the boss found out and - pfft - here I am. - Well, good riddance to them - if they couldn't take a joke. - Thanks. And now that I'm sitting here hearing all these fools on the line, I gotta tell you: I am tempted to teach them a thing or two. Do either of you have the urge? - Hm. Every single day. - Uh-huh? Hahaha! Never felt this way before. - Neither have I. - I... I love you, Diana. I love you too, Marcus, forever. - Do you need a refresher on the rules? - No. - I just... - It's kind of rude to be nosy. Are you sure this is the right address? Yeah. This is it. 1025 Rusholme Road. So Margaret Robinson's a nun? I don't know, but I'm guessing he can tell us. Excuse me! Hi. Hi there. I'm sorry to bother you. I'm wondering if you can help us out. We're looking for a woman named Margaret Robinson and this was her last known address. Margaret Robinson was a novitiate here, - but she's no longer with us. - Why is that? She was asked to leave two years ago this past Easter. A novitiate kicked out of the order? - That doesn't happen every day. - What did she do? - I'd rather not discuss that. - Well, can you at least tell us where she went? Did she leave a forwarding address? - I'm afraid not. I'm sorry. - Well, do you have a photo of Margaret? Something in the archives? All records of Margaret Robinson were destroyed. I'm sorry. - Sounds like a story there. - I'll say. Something tells me she might spill the beans. - Lovely begonias! - Oh. Did Sister Margaret ever help out with the garden? I haven't heard that name in years. - Did you know her? - Only by reputation. She was the talk of the parish when I arrived. So you never met her? - What was said? - Gossip is a sin. She was asked to leave because she had relations with a man. - Hmm. - Thank you. Ah. A nun?! No, of course I've never dated a nun. - Isn't that illegal or something? - Or something. What does a nun have to do with someone trying to ruin - my life anyway? - We're following a lead. You're sure you've never met anyone named Margaret Robinson? I'm 100% certain! And it sounds like you don't think Amos Pound is behind all this. We don't. Your former partner accepted - a job at a rival company, but... - He what?! That scoundrel! It doesn't mean he has anything to do with the trouble you've been having. Well, do you have any other suspects? Because I'm this close to having to sell - the store to pay my creditors. - We're working on it. "Working on it," what does that mean?! It means your case is our number one priority. OK, good. Thank you. Good. I could really use some good news. We'll call you the minute we have any leads. Sorry for calling again. I just needed to hear your voice. I'm glad you did. I've been thinking. - About what? - Our future, Marcus. - I want to be with you forever. - Awww... I want to be with you forever too. I already have my grandmother's ring. Oh, Marcus, I love you. Mary? There's a call for you. Uh, thank you. Hello? How may I help you as your operator? Just one moment, please. Yes, putting you through. Hello? Mary, hi. Calling to see how everything's going over there. Oh, hi, Trudy. Well, I won't speak for Flo, but this job is fascinating. That's... great. Look, I want to give you an update on the person we're both looking for. Oh, I see. We're speaking in code. Good idea. You never know who might be listening in. Well, this person used to be in the habit of going to church quite often. So we're looking for a devout woman. Very. A real sister of God. - We're looking for a nun? - Flo?! - Hi, Flo. - How did you get on the line? Well, one of the perks of being an operator. Alright, Trudy. So we're looking for a nun? Is that everything? Because, If so, we really should go. It's quite busy around here. You know you're not really supposed to be answering calls, right? Well, of course, but we can only do what we are here to do if we don't get fired. We'll see you tonight! So then Diana's mother gets on the line, and she says if they don't stop seeing each other she's going to send Diana to... Have you been listening in on more calls? No. Looking out for one another has its limits. I would hate to have to tell Mr. Millard about this. Come on, Lilian, it's your last week. Relax and have a little fun. I don't consider listening in on people's phone calls fun. So why is it your last week? Company policy when you're getting married. Matrimonial retirement, we call it. We're taking Lil out tonight to celebrate. You two should join us. We'd love to. Where are you meeting? - We haven't decided yet. - Well, there's a great new speakeasy down in the Ward called Jelly's. Sounds like fun. Be there at 8? We wouldn't miss it for the world. - I am so tired I could die. - I don't know how I'm gonna find the energy to study after a day like this. Other than exhausting, how is it? Infuriating. Do you have any idea what stupid and offensive things people say when they don't think anyone's listening? I had half a mind to tell someone where to shove it. I think we need to find out who Margaret Robinson is - before you do that, Flo. - If you insist. - Anyone get close to the book? - Not a soul. But we are keeping our eyes peeled. - Anyone suspicious? - Well, there's Lilian. Caught her taking notes today, and she got very huffy when I asked her about it. - Lilian? Really? - Yes! And she's getting married too. So I'm thinking if she is Margaret Robinson, it could be to the man that she got kicked out of the nunnery for. Lilian seems like such a rule follower though. And Margaret Robinson left her holy vocation for a man. So we're looking for a rule breaker. Alright. Well, what about Busy? You got to know her a little bit today. A little. I sense that she's the office gossip. Maybe she can get you the dirt on the other operators. That's the hope. A couple of drinks at Jelly's ought to loosen her tongue. Oh my gosh! Speaking of which, we are late! Does that mean I have to get up? - Yes! Put your... shoe on! - Alright, alright. Argh! - Everything hurts. Everything. - Oh, prtt! Cheers. Sorry, Bill. I know it was just supposed to be us two. Ah, it's OK. I find your work fascinating. Even when we're just doing surveillance? - Even then. - Another ginger ale, please. I may not get to church much these days, but every morning and every evening, Jesus and I have a really good chat. - How lovely for you. - Any of you ladies have a close and personal relationship with our lord and saviour? No? Well, I prefer to put my faith in things I can see. Like toys. Have you gals seen what they're selling down at the Penny and Pound these days? It's miraculous. Gals, I'd like you to meet - my oldest friend in the world... - Hi! - ...Miss Julia Berger. - Hi. - Very nice to meet you. - Frankie, isn't that...? - That's Ernie's ex-fiancée. - She just happens to be the best friend of the telephone operator from the exchange? I think we just found Margaret Robinson. Thank you for coming. Why am I here, Miss Drake? And why did you insist I bring Busy with me? - It's about Ernie Penny. - I've already told you I have nothing to do with whatever's going on with that man. - Well, what about your friend? - Me? Someone at your telephone exchange is tracking Ernie's calls. You're the only operator with a personal connection to him. - This is ridiculous. - Your best friend taking revenge on the man who hurt you? I don't find it - that ridiculous. - I swear, I'm not. I wouldn't! I should have guessed. Mr. Penny, we weren't expecting you. I always knew that you and all of Julia's friends hated me, but I didn't think you'd stoop so low as to try to ruin my business! Leave her alone, Ernie! I don't know what you're talking about. - Mr. Penny, please! - Miserable brats, both of them! - I am very sorry, ladies. - You'll pardon me if I'm not interested in your apologies, or anything else from you, Miss Drake. Hello. Operator. How may I help you? - Yes. Right away. - Morning, Edna. - Morning. - Streetcar was late. Oof. Morning, Lilian. - Can I help you? - CHERRY 5942, PLEASE. Right away, ma'am. I called as soon as I could. Archie stepped out again. - With his secretary this time. - Oh, June! He didn't even try to hide it? Ah, that is so awful! Not in the slightest. Why can't men just be satisfied with what they have? God only knows. Convent school. I'll... I leave tomorrow. - She can't just do that, Diana. - She did. I don't want to live without you, Marcus, but what do we do? I don't know. Hello? Yeah, ma'am. Connecting you now. Uh-huh. Yeah. OK. Bill found Busy's birth records. She's telling the truth: she is not Margaret Robinson. My gut says there is something in this notebook - that will lead us to her. - But this is just pages and pages of calls that she was tracking. Well, maybe we're going about this wrong. - What do you mean? - How many printing houses in Toronto are binding ornate notebooks like that? There can't be many. Do you think we can track Margaret Robinson - if we could track the notebook? - It's worth a shot. Look at this. "Beene Printing." I know that. We walked by there the other day. It was a few doors down from the church that we were just at. Yep, that's definitely one of ours. Do you remember the woman who you sold it to? We didn't sell it to a woman, we sold it to a church. Haskell and I do the printing and binding for every catholic church in town. - Wow! Must keep you busy. - Busy is what we like. We're looking for a novitiate named Margaret Robinson. - Does that name ring a bell? - What business - would we have with a novitiate? - Well, she's right down the street at St. Andrew's... Like I said: we don't have any cause to have - business with novitiates. - Thank you for your time. They definitely know who Margaret Robinson is. It looks like the husband wanted to say something. - Mhm. - Oh, I gotta go. - Ernie's gonna be at the office. - What for? He said he had some exciting news that he couldn't tell me over the phone. His moods make me dizzy. Alright, you handle that; I'll see if I can get - anything out of Haskell alone. - OK. Of course. Connecting you right now. How may I place your call? I'm sorry I'm late, ladies. You would not - believe the morning I've had. - What happened? Dragged into some private detective's office and accused of using this job as a way to spy on Ernie Penny, the single worst man I've ever met. Busy, that's terrible! Why-why don't you take a moment to calm down? I am calm. And I'll tell you what's terrible. I was about to give these so-called detectives a piece of my mind when Ernie comes in and screams at me. - What in the devil happened? - I don't know. What are you doing? I think Lilian is Margaret Robinson. What? Why? Well, because she took the notebook and she was - very sketchy about it too. - What's all that? I don't know. It just looks like random numbers and letters. - Phone numbers? - I don't know. Look. - These are stock tips. - What?! Is that what she's been scribbling down this entire time? - Shhhh! - No, I will not shush! She's reprimanded me twice today for listening in on calls, and here she is doing it herself! It doesn't mean she's necessarily the person who's messing with Ernie. I am tempted to walk into Mr. Millard's office. - Oh my gosh! - What? It's a contract for the sale of the toy factory. You are right: Lilian is Margaret Robinson. Frankie Drake? - My dream! My lucky charm! - Mr. Penny. Call me Ernie, I insist. Ernie, what's the good news? I've found a silent partner for the store. Or rather a silent partner has found me. You've turned my fortunes around. I appreciate the compliment, but that wasn't my doing. Well, whatever the case, I'm grateful. I still want you on the case of course. - Of course. - Don't want whoever's trying to bring me down to get away with it. - Go on, give 'em a sniff. - No, I'm OK. Come on! What reflexes! Well, Trudy has been keeping me on my toes the last few days. Good woman! Well, I'm off to meet the new partner. Speak soon, Frankie Drake! - Drake Private Detectives. - Frankie, we found her. I'm just going to drop these at St. Mark's. - Be back in a few. - Mm-hm. - Forget something? - No. But I think you did. I don't want to talk about Margaret Robinson. - Oh. So you do know her. - Not anymore. What's that supposed to mean? I haven't seen her since she tried to ruin my wedding, OK? Ruin your wedding? Why would she... You're the man she was kicked out of the nunnery for. I loved her. I really did. - Thought she was the one. - So what happened? I'm a Catholic. Guilt happened. - So you split up. - I couldn't take the idea that she lost her vocation because of me. Hm. Well, you wouldn't happen to have a photo of her, would you? Don't tell my wife. Frankie, you're never gonna believe this! Who is she? - Hm. - It's Lilian. She took the notebook, so Flo and I went through her purse and we found stock tips and this. Which one is she? She's the one in the blue dress. Can I help you? Why are you trying to ruin Ernie Penny's life? I'm sorry. Who? Ernie Penny, the owner of Penny and Pound toy company. I've never heard of him. If you've never heard of Ernie Penny, then why are you tracking his calls? I don't know what you're on about, or who you are for that matter! This is the lady detective who dragged me into her office this morning. Well, I don't know what you want with me, but... This is your book, isn't it? Only since I found it this afternoon. And you are the new owner of Shipman Toy Company? So what if I am? I was under the impression that my client and the owner were the only two people who knew it was for sale. Well, I overheard Mr. Shipman talking - about how he wanted to retire. - You overheard how? On the phone. Well, isn't that the pot calling the kettle black? So this has nothing to do with Ernie Penny? Like I said, I've never heard of him. What in blazes is going on out here? You two, in my office now! The rest of you, back to work! Oh! Oh! Ugh! June, hi. I just read an article in the Ladies' Home Journal and thought of you. Apparently, coffee can help you lose weight fast. Sure, if that's all you're eating. "Melts the fat away," so they say. I thought, since Archie's wandering again... He said if I didn't lose the baby weight soon, he would leave me. If he does that, I lose everything! I'm leaving on the 7 o'clock train. I'll meet you at the station. You can't; Mother's coming with me. It can't end like this, on the phone. I need to see you before you leave. I don't think I can get away. So this is it? Hello, this is your operator speaking. Meet me at City Hall at 4:30 p.m. What? Why? Because I can help you. Of course. Hello, this is your operator speaking. Yes, ma'am. Building yourself a little nest egg, Lilian? I wouldn't have to if you didn't have such archaic rules! Do you know I need to quit my job because I'm getting married? That policy is in place because married women's - priorities are different, and... - That policy is ridiculous. - That is your opinion, but... - Do you know how hard this job is? How little operators get paid? I've given six years of my life and the way that I see it, I'm entitled to use a little of what I hear to... to get ahead. - Hey, Frankie! - Trudy needs us at the toy shop. - Now. - Let's go. You can't just walk out in the middle of a shift! - Yes, we can. - Because we triple A quit. Triple A? - Trudy! - Oh! - Ernie's got Margaret Robinson inside! - That's Edna! Oh, my God! I never would have guessed! So she must have overheard Ernie saying something untoward one day and decided to ruin his life because of it? Yeah, that'd be my guess. My thing is how did Ernie find out before we did? Ernie said that a silent partner just "found him." Maybe Edna decided to take her sabotage off the phone and into the real world. We need to get in there before he does something. And then you lure me to my own store pretending to be the answer to all of my problems. And for what? To laugh at my expense? As if outbidding me for Shipman's wasn't enough. I swear, I don't know anything about a Shipman's. - I... I just... - Shut up! I don't want to hear your pathetic excuses. Put the gun down, Ernie. You were supposed to be my lucky charm! I said that I would help you and I will. How? What Edna did was wrong, but she didn't buy the toy factory. I know who did and I have a plan, but you need to put down the gun now! Ah... Oh! AH! - Hi, Edna. - Or should we say Margaret? I was trying to make the world a kinder place. By ruining Ernie Penny's life? - And not just Ernie's. - What about Norma Embleton? What did she do? Or William Kumar, Matthew Parker, or all of the other people you were listening to? You know what these people are like, the things they say, when they think no one is listening. Doesn't any part of you ever want to teach them a lesson? What happened to "judge not lest ye be judged"? I left the church when it abandoned me. - It certainly judged me. - So you became God? These people... all anonymous behind their telephones, all spouting lies and cruelty and hatred; you don't think they deserve to be held to account? - By you?! - I just wanted to make things right. Ernie Penny almost jumped off of a bridge because of what you did; do you call that making it right? I didn't mean for anything like that to happen. I swear! You didn't think your actions would have consequences? Not like that, I didn't! I guess it's time for you to start repenting. So I have a lawyer on standby ready to draw up the papers to make you co-owners and operators of Shipman Toy Factory. I don't know about this, Frankie. That may be the one thing we agree on, Mr. Penny. I'm sorry. I thought the two of you would be thrilled. "Thrilled"? Are you kidding? No, I'm not. Given that the alternative is me calling the police and having the two of you thrown in jail. Thrilled is what I was going for. - Here you go, June. - Oh, I didn't order this. I know, but I read about this amazing new diet in the Ladies Home Journal. It's called divorce. I highly recommend it. You can lose 200 pounds almost overnight. - Delicious. Thank you. - My pleasure. Have a nice day, Archie. Oh, there you are. What are you doing here? I figure I owed you a date where you weren't watching me work. Sounds perfect. Oh! Boy, am I glad to see you two. - Mary. What's up? - Uh, we need a witness. Do you have a minute? - Who's "we"? - My, um... my friends are getting married. - "Friends"? - Oh, well. Acquaintances. Really. From where? I met them while I was working undercover. I overhead them talking on the telephone. It's such a tragic story. Diana here, her mother's going to send her to a nunnery. You know what, Mary? It's OK, I don't need the details. So will you do it? There's a minister inside. It will only take a minute, I promise. What do you say? I'd be honoured. I love weddings. Come on.
