 This family is under attack. We are... ..."ghost nation." - Newport, rhode island, man. - I've always loved it down here. It's my home state. - Yeah, man. It's so pretty here, man. It really is. What you got in jersey like this? We have some industrial plants. We're back in newport, rhode island, At the request of our old friend denise bettencourt. In 2010, we had the chance to investigate Her seaview terrace mansion, And our team had several disturbing experiences. Now, dennis has asked us to return Because she feels the energy in the house Has taken an even darker turn. You weren't there last time we came. No. I was not. Has anything changed since the last time? Like, why did they call you back? Yes. The activity has ramped up quite a bit. Oh, my god. Is that the house? This is it. - Oh, yeah. - Wow, man. God, that's beautiful. What would you do with all those rooms? Have a lot of fun. Look how beautiful. I mean, it's as gorgeous as I remember. We've always been close to the family, And they're in new york right now. So, the place is ours. And the best part... We could stay, See if anything happens while we're here sleeping. What a week we're gonna have. We've all been here. You've never been here. So, you get to go first. That way, if anything happens, we're okay. - Exactly. - So, after you. Wow. At about 40,000 square feet, with 54 rooms, Seaview terrace is considered The largest privately owned mansion on the east coast. And this incredible place has a long and twisted history. Seaview terrace was built by the whiskey tycoon edson bradley And his wife, julia. It was originally his mansion in washington, d.C., And they decided to move to newport, rhode island. They wanted to bring their house with them. So, he reassembled it on an existing mansion That was here in newport, rhode island. A year after the house was completed, Mrs. Bradley passed away in the house, And was laid to rest here in the chapel. The city took over seaview terrace during world war ii, And used it as officers housing. After the war ended, he became a boys' school, And then, a school for girls. It was also used as a dormitory For 36 years. This house has been a home To thousands of people, year after year after year. I always knew that something that had so much history Would carry with it a lot of paranormal experiences, Whatever is in this house, you have to expect That it's gonna show its face to you once in a while. Throughout the years, There are a lot of different experiences With hearing mrs. Bradley play the organ in the organ room, As well as the great hall. One student happened upon the basement by accident. I don't know what his experience was, But he ran out of the house screaming, terrified. After that, he refused to go down to the basement. He stayed far, far away from that. I heard all these stories that, up on the third floor, In the circle room, there was a nun From the school for girls That had tried to commit suicide here. My parents bought seaview terrace in 1974. I believe it was fate. When we moved in here full time, There is more activity trying to make us aware That somebody else was there. Then, it just intensified. I walked up to the second floor. And I started hearing voices. And then, I felt fingers touching the back of my neck And my head... Like I was being touched by 1,000 people At the same time. I ran to the master bedroom, And shut the door. And I didn't come out. Aside from the architectural history And the reports of paranormal activity, Seaview terrace is legendary for other reasons, too. "dark shadows" was a paranormal soap opera Popular in the late 1960s, And seaview terrace was used as the exterior on that show. "dark shadows" fans visit a few times a year. But recently, during one of those events, Someone's cult passion for the program Might have brought something truly dark into the house. There was one person that had come That no one was really associated with. They had stayed in the organ room, And in fact, performed rituals and a seance. And had burned a six-point star into the wood floor. I was terrified that it had brought an entity, Or some sort of black force, into the house. After that had happened, There was definitely a change in the energy of the house. Shortly after that, I was up on the third floor, outside of a doorway, And I kind of felt that I wasn't alone. All of a sudden, I saw this dark shadow figure Move around the corner very quickly. I was startled. It put me on edge. So, after we had this change in energy That scared us for a while, We didn't know what to do about it. If jason, steve, and tango could get it out, Or identify it, And find some sort of a solution, It would mean the world to me. With such an expansive property, There's a lot to cover, so we're placing our cameras Primarily in the most storied and active areas. I think we need to move this camera a little closer. That includes the circle room, Where a nun was said to have committed suicide... Are you able to see the stairs, though? Yep ...In the second floor hallway, Where chris claimed to hear voices And feel hands grabbing at him... ...In the organ room, Where a guest performed a ritual, And marked a six-pointed star onto the wood floor, In the great hall, where people have seen An apparition believed to be mrs. Bradley, And they heard her playing the organ. And in the third floor hallway, Where denise saw a strange shadow figure. In the time it's taken us to set up most of our gear, The sun has gone down. And whatever might be lurking at seaview terrace Seems ready to make itself known. I'd tape it a little. Are you hearing footsteps? Let's just check. I heard that really loud noise like that. I thought it came in through there. I sounded like... This, like... Like, see if you, like, Opened up a soda. Like, it went pssh. Oh, like a pssh, like a can opening? Yeah. That's exactly what I kept hearing. Did you see that? That weird flashing? Oh. Hmm. I mean, they're already hearing footsteps moving. Watch right here. That light, though, was there somebody up there? Let's go find shari and dave. Alright. Hey, shari. Go ahead. Were you guys on the second floor, just now, Shining your lights? No. Why? So, if there is somebody in here with us, Can you please make a sound? Did you hear that? Like a whistle? Hey, shari. Go ahead. Were you guys on the second floor, just now, Shining your lights? No. Why? What was that? It sounded like an air compressor. It was like a... Yeah. You heard that Mm-hmm. Hang on one sec. Could it have been the bug zapper? Exactly. That had to be a big bug. That's what it was. That got me good. But still, it doesn't explain the light. No. That made me jump. Me, too. Okay. The night just started. Yep. Looks like it started before we were ready. Yes, it did. The house doesn't wait for us. We regroup back at command center to figure out Where everyone will start for tonight's investigation. Hey. You know where you want to go? It doesn't matter to me. What is going...? - Whoa. - I just left there. Still moving. I don't know if she should be going in there alone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Shari? - Yeah. Was anybody in here? - No. - No. It was this camera, right? You know, when I first went in there, It looked like it was aimed on the wall. And I'm like... but I don't... It's aimed out here. Dave? We might not have walkie. I can run... No, I got it. Why do I see it moving? Is it moving? -Shari? Dave? -Yeah. -Yeah. There's nobody in there. No. This is steve's room. Enjoy, steve. He gets to stare at all these faces, too. We've got to mark a time stamp on that. - Yeah, - the whole camera's just moving, All by itself. Nobody was in there. - Alright. - It was adjusting itself. When I came in here, it was aimed, like, Towards the wall, right? And I was like, "what the hell?" And then, all of that happened. What was that? I mean, we literally watched it Start moving right before our eyes. You guys have had footsteps. We had this crazy light already happen. And then, this whole camera moving on its own. That's three things, And we haven't even started investigating. This is the third floor circle room. We heard that... A nun was supposedly in this room. And then, she hung herself in here. What's your name? Can you tell us if you hung yourself? There are a lot of stories that surround this room. We want to know if any of them are true. Can you set the record straight for us? You know, shari, let's go check out some other rooms On this floor, and we can circle back here. Plus, we have a camera in here. And we have a camera in the hallway, so... If anything moves, or makes a sound... We'll get it. While dave and sherry continue scoping out the third floor. Steve and I are on the ground floor, Where we'll attempt to help denise With another, even more personal request. Recently, it's been very hard. My father passed away. And I know that this was his favorite place to be, of anywhere. He put his heart and soul into it. He loved every part of this house. I really hope that jason, steve, and tango Could find the evidence that he's here with us. Martin? Mr. Carey? Your daughter, denise, asked us to come, And check out the house. Is there anything you'd like to say to denise? Maybe to her husband, chris? A frigging bug flying around my head, or something. I don't see a bug. It went by my ear twice. It was like... I don't see anything. Whoever was moving our camera earlier, Can you move it again for us? J, that was in the organ room. Yeah. Say it is mrs. Bradley in there, right? Could she be like, "what is this thing?" I mean, she would have no idea, if you think about it. Right. I wonder if she's like, "what is this?" And moving it around. That sounded like. That was a bang. You notice a... Movement and a bang just happened. Yeah. That sounded like... Like a sack. Like a heavy sack, or something. That was, for sure, right here. Hello? Martin? Mrs. Bradley? We've been here many times to visit you. Was that from behind? Yep. That was a full sentence. That was right here. I mean, that was... But that was a whole voice. You were right. And it sounded like a male voice, Saying There were words in there. Again, down near where you're sleeping. Camera moving, male voice. Good luck tonight. What's that? Wait, wait, wait, wait. It almost sounded like... Bats or something. I heard that in the distance. Yeah. I heard that for sure. There was something again. You heard that? I did. Like It sounded more like a whistle that time. Was that a laugh? I thought I heard somebody go, "ha. Ha ha." I heard some movement. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. What is that? That sounds like someone dragging. Right above us. We play organ music in the space that was the church. It'll echo pretty well. - Absolutely. If that's you, touch it again. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. What is that? That sounds like someone dragging. Right above us. It was just voices. Is somebody in the wing down here? I... Shari and tango could be on the third floor. Hello? Steve, nobody's in here. J... There is... There's nobody. Down here. Man, I tell you what... We heard... That was v... It was somebody talking. And there's nobody down here. Anybody in there? No. - No? There's nobody. There's nobody in here. This doesn't even open. So, whoever was just talking... J, that's not possible. It was two full sentences... ...And the sound of something being dragged across this floor. Wow. No way. I mean, at this point, I say we give it a few. Just let it chill out, and see what else happens. Absolutely. We've had some interest... Some really interesting things happen. Full sentences don't just happen willy nilly. Let's do it. Yeah. Alright. I like that plan. What was that? Was it, like, a grunt? Was that dave? I heard that, for sure. J to dave. Go for dave. Where are you? The third floor circle room. He's on the third floor. It wasn't dave. He's up on the third floor. We're on the first floor, and we've had footsteps. We've had voices, footsteps... I mean, it's been kind of crazy. We just heard a noise. We thought it was you making some weird little grunt sounds. We just came towards the ballroom, and it's not you. You're two floors up. Yeah. Two floors up, and kind of in the opposite direction. - That's awesome. - Wow. J, we've been following voices Around this place all night long. And it started long before we started investigating. Yeah, it did. That's how to start a case, I tell you what. That's how to kick off a week in a haunted mansion. - Hey, guys. - Hello. Hey, what's up? Not too much. How was your night? It was good. Honestly, we had a lot of neat things happen... I mean, voices and movement, walking. Wow. It wasn't just, like, a word. It was full sentences, twice. And even some sliding sounds, Like somebody dragging a sack across a floor. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Yeah. I mean, for us, during this run, A couple of sounds here and there, But nothing... nothing like what you guys had. I think, yeah, you guys definitely have to take the... The bottom floors, as well. It's a big place. I mean, we could use some extra hands. Absolutely. We could use the help for sure. I mean, we have some friends who investigated this place with us In the past... amy and adam. Oh, my god. Yes. I mean, if they can make it here, that would be awesome. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I hope so. - So, let's reach out to them, See if maybe they want to hang out with us The next couple of nights, and go from there. Awesome. Sounds good. We've divided up the sleeping arrangements To cover the most active parts of the house. Alrighty. I'll be in the ballroom, where the ghost of mrs. Bradley Has been reported. Shari is on the third floor, near the spot Where denise encountered a shadow figure. Steve's in the organ room, where a self-proclaimed warlock Performed a dark ritual. Cot, sweet cot. And dave is camping out In the downstairs hallway, Where we just heard a series of strange noises. How are you making out, steve? Is it hot in there? Yeah. It's actually terrible. I'm gonna be sweaty all night ling. Yeah. Be nice if we had, like, A way to cool off, or something. Oh. I just fell off the damn cot. Did you really? Yeah. Off the edge, right onto the ground. I don't even know what to say. I hope the dvr didn't get it. Our already very active investigation Is about to get support from our paranormal pals, Amy bruni and adam berry, who live nearby. They're quite familiar with seaview terrace And its history of hauntings. While we wait for them to arrive, Dave and I are doing background research On the architecture of this amazing home. Now, dave, check this out... The galt family built a house in washington, d.C. And then, some years later, the bradley family... Julia bradley and her husband... Bought that house, 20 years later... She bought seaview terrace... This house... And then, merged them together. The bradley family dismantled their house in washington, d.C., And brought it over, on rail, to reassemble it Like a jigsaw puzzle in newport, rhode island. Like a hybrid. Yeah. This is a picture of julia bradley. Wow. Beautiful. See that face? You see that dress? Being a ghost town. I found an article... "j.B. Kernochan run over." He built the seaview terrace. Yeah. I'll read this to you real quick. "March 2nd, james b. Kernochan, the well-known banker, While on his way to the patriarch's ball last night, Was run over by a car." So, he died in new york, not here. Voices. Amy and adam. Yep. That's them. Alright. Let's go find them. - Hello. - Hey, hey. Hey, guys. Wow. This place has not changed at all. This place is wild. Last night, I mean, we had a great night. Even before we started investigating, We were chasing stuff around. - Really? - Yeah. And denise, who's been a good friend of ours for a long time. And, you know, she's just lost her dad. But there's been an increase of activity here. At one point, they had a "dark shadows" thing going on here. And denise ended up finding a six-pointed star drawing On the floor in the room. Wow. She was saying activity had picked up since. A guy who claims to be a warlock came forward, And said, "I did that." So crazy. Anything in the basement new? Because I know, when we were there, We felt like dirt was falling on our heads. Yeah, it was weird. I remember it distinctly 'cause it was so scary, The feeling... I thought that the floor was crumbling over me. And it felt like dirt was like... And I was like, "what is happening?" But it was... There was nothing there. And you can see the video, I'm freaking out. But there was nothing. Well, see if you have the same feeling At some point down there. I mean, it's been five, six, seven years Since we've investigated together. - Seven... - Gosh, it's been... It's been a long time. So, this is gonna be fun. It's like a family reunion. Alright. Let's gear up, and get ready for tonight. You guys want to jump in with them? Absolutely. Let's do it. The addition of amy and adam to the team Will allow us to spread out, and cover more ground. Shari and jason start the night at the monitors monitors. Amy and I will head to the second floor, While adam and dave tackle the basement. Apparently, this is where they store Their Halloween decorations. Alright, I'm gonna set up the laser grid over here. It shows you pixelation of whatever is in front of it. And it shows motion... Like an area, like where you're coming from. What have they said has happened down here? The only thing we know is that A foreign exchange student was here, And he was in the basement, and he ran out crying. Gets spooked down here. He runs away. Well, let's just start, see what happens. My name is adam. My name is dave. We've been here before. Did you hear anything? It was a very... It was right here. It was very high-pitched. Like, I first thought it was maybe like a little... You know, when a mosquito gets near your ear. Uh-huh. So, I don't know if it was a mosquito, or something else. Is there somebody here trying to get our attention? Denise found a... Six-point star... In a room upstairs. She feels that, ever since then, There's been a negative feeling in this house. Do you have anything to do with that star? It's a self-proclaimed warlock. Hmm. And he says, "I did it." I mean, it's interesting. I think, no matter what people's beliefs behind it, It's the intention of the person who put it there. Mm-hmm. And you are basically imbuing your energy And your intention into that space Without any regard for anyone else's energy, Or what they're dealing with. So, this person now has to, like, live in a house That has this kind of weird intention attached to it. Right. So, what's to say it doesn't bring in something A bit darker, and negative? If you're hiding back here, We don't want to disturb anything That you're doing, or your space. So if there is somebody in here with us, Can you please make a sound, wherever you are? We're in newport, rhode island, Investigating the imposing seaview terrace mansion, An architectural hybrid that's steeped in historic lore And reports of paranormal activity. Recently, a guest identifying as a warlock Conducted a ritual, Marking a six-pointed star symbol Onto the floor of the organ room. And now, the homeowners are concerned That the ceremony might have invited in something sinister. After that had happened, There was definitely a change in the energy of the house. Tonight, dave and adam started in the basement, Trying to track this mysterious energy. And they may have made contact. So, if there is somebody in here with us, Can you please make a sound, wherever you are? Somebody here? Martin, you're not down here, are you? Julia bradley. Does that name ring a bell? I heard a thud. Yep. Tango to command center. Go ahead, dave. Was there, like, a kind of a loud thud That just happened maybe 10 seconds ago? Nope. We're looking at all the cameras. Nobody's moving. Copy. Thank you. I mean, it is just a thud, But we got it on talking about... Was it julia? Yeah. Yeah. We were talking about julia. J to dave. Go for dave. Is it good if I send shari down to join you? The more the merrier. So, let's just go back here, just because I feel like, If the if the thud happened in this direction, Maybe there's something to... This area. Miss bradley. Did you hear that? It's like a... like a whistle. Like... Woman's... like a... yeah. Maybe it's leading us somewhere. Hello? Do you know who mrs. Bradley is? Amy; isn't the ceiling in here, The creepiest thing you've ever seen? -Yeah. You slept in here, with these looking down on you? Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh. This would have actually had an organ in it. Is that why they call it the organ room? Am I... I mean, that would make sense. I guess it probably piped out into that large space, If she were having, like, a ball, or something. I wonder, on the other side of it. I know. I'm dying to know if it's... Oh, wait. It's right here, steve. See? Oh, look. There's an organ next to it. Okay. So, I would say you're 100% right That there was an organ in that room. The pipes probably went up, And the music came through into the ballroom, here. I know. What was that? - That was pretty loud. - That was loud. There was an organ in that room. The pipes probably went up, And the music came through into the ballroom, here. I know. What was that? - That was pretty loud. - That was loud. It sounded like a door. J to steve. Go for steve. Hey, are you guys looking into the sound... What sounded like a door close? Yeah. Yes. Alright. Okay. 'cause when I was coming back in, I went to adjust the other camera. And I was coming back in. And I heard what sounded like a door closing. I thought it was you guys, but I see you guys Looking all around, so... Oh, he heard it, too. Yeah, no, we had just started talking about organ music, And that's when we heard that. And then, we just started to chase it down, with no origin. It's awesome that you heard it, too. I thought it came from the organ room. It was behind me, and it was loud. It kind of startled me. Copy that. Thank you, j. ...This door sounds like if you try to open it. - Steve. - Yo? Steve, it happened pretty much... I was right here when I heard it. You were close. Oh, yeah. I was was. I'm gonna close this door, jake. Yeah, go ahead. Let me know If this is the... - That's not it. - It's totally different. Alright. Now, we'll do the organ room door. Okay, here comes the organ room. This isn't gonna lock me in here. It doesn't even close all the way. That one won't even close, j. Yeah. You know, it's similar, but it's not the same. Okay. This door... Yeah, why not this one? Oh. Wait. Oh, that's... That's class. ...Really close. Can I go back to where I was standing? Do it. Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna want you to do it. Alright, we were, like... Yeah, we were right here. - Ready? - Yep. That sounds exactly like it. It's, like, the exact same distance, too. Yeah. What is that door to? I don't know. Let's find out. That has the same cadence, the same... It sounds exactly like what we heard. Yeah. That's weird, 'cause it sounded like It came from right behind me, this way. But then again, I don't know. We got rock walls. It's locked? Yeah. All the good doors are locked. Wait a second. What about something Who would know this as not locked. Trying to go to it... - That's true. "what is this? Lock my door?" It's probably, like, a coat room, or something. Oh, most likely. Yeah. That's a good call. Like, you can imagine coming in here for parties, and like... - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. You wanted to walk into that. You would greet them from up there. "welcome." Like, seriously. I would. Hello. - Hello. - Hey. So, anything going on? We literally just had a thud. We were talking about julia bradley. Oh. Okay. Yeah. So, we're going off of that. It sounded like it was coming from this direction and up. Right. And then we when we got here, There was, like, this female whisper That kept going this way, as if... "keep going this way." So, I'm glad you're here, because I feel like, In that time period, if it is mrs. Bradley, There's no way she's going to let us speak to her without... Well, that's true. Right. Because they were very proper back then. Exactly. So, maybe, if you... Since you're here, You can, like, have this connection with her. It's definitely coming from here. And I feel like it was more that way, too, Like, going back that way. And if you don't mind going first, Just because you can set the scene. Did you guys go in here, or just stay here? Oh, no, we haven't been back here yet. Oh, oh. Okay. Yeah, 'cause this is where we were kind of being led. What do they keep in here? Drinking water. Yeah, I guess so. Miss bradley, our friend came down, Just because... There's a bunch of men here, you know. And it might be better to have a lady present with you, So that you know that we're not... We don't mean anything untoward. Hello, julia. My name is shari. And we do not mean any disrespect. So, if you are here with us, is there any way That you can let us know that you're here... Maybe a loud sound, a knocking, Just anything that will... Who is that? So, if you are here with us, is there any way That you can let us know that you're here... Maybe a loud sound, a knocking, Just anything that will... Who is that? Tango to the rest of the team. Can you just stomp your feet right now? Yeah, we're on rock floor near the front door, So, I'm gonna do it right now. No. No, 'cause it was right here. No, I don't think it was us, dave. We're all the way down near the front door. Thank you. Alright. Mrs. Bradley, I'm gonna ask you one more time. If you're with us, can you make a loud noise again? I mean, that was on cue, though. I know. Should we go and check in? Yeah. Let's head upstairs. Up these little stairs, here, There's a pretty cool room on the left. Oh, geez. It just keeps going. Yeah. It does. Oh, I remember this. This was someone's room. Chris sometimes stays in some of these nicer sort of rooms, here, He's a little creeped out by this place. Oh, really? Yeah. Whatever is in this house, You have to expect that it's gonna show its face To you once in a while. Hello. My name is steve. I'm amy. Martin, if you are up here, we want to let you know that Denise has asked us to try to talk to you, Because she believes that you're still here. And she would love to hear from you. I just heard something in here. It was just, like, a shuffling. It could have been... Like, it was just in this room. Martin, if it is you, thank you. After completing our sweep of the second floor, Amy and I rejoin the rest of the team Just in time for dave to hear something incredible That jason found while reviewing audio recordings. So, what's to say it doesn't bring in Something a bit darker, and negative. Did you get it? We're talking about, are you attached to that hexagram? I'm getting... No way. And you say, "what if it did bring something in darker?" I don't know what it's saying. Weird. So, just listen yourself. And my heart's going. - Really? - Yeah. "yes." What? Alright. So, I want you to listen to it. He said... no, I want you to listen to it first. He said, "could you say something?" 'cause he says something about, "what's to say. It didn't bring in something darker?" And it sounds like it says, "I do." Like, "I do," like... I'm saying you don't bring it... Didn't bring in anything darker. Take a listen. That's interesting. So, what's to say it doesn't bring in Something a bit darker, and negative?" Is that what it said? It was silent in the basement. We would have heard that. Yeah, but remember, I mean, that symbol... It could be anything. You know what? Regardless of what the symbol was... It's the meaning behind it. The fact that it was a ceremony. Absolutely. And that's what we were talking about. They could have drawn anything. It's just all about what their intention behind it was. Exactly. Okay, well, then, what is here? What is happening? Like, they're obviously helping us in the investigation. It's like, they are saying, "I'll tell you. I know." I'm also wondering, what if we send Just the two ladies down there to see? 'cause things are more prone to communicate with them usually. Alright. Well, I mean, it's late. It's hot. Get some rest. Get cranking early tomorrow Got a lot more to find out. Dive in. Review some evidence. Some more history, and everything else. - Absolutely. - Alright. Let's wrap it. Get some rest. After we captured and evp that suggests The ritual ceremony did not, in fact, Let in a dark presence, The next morning, amy, adam, and I I turn our research Towards some of the disturbing stories Surrounding former occupants of the property. So, you guys are pretty well aware of all the rumors That have been circulating around this place. And looking into sort of, I guess, the most popular one That people are always talking about, is the nun. I mean, I've researched this place a few times, And nothing has ever come up about a nun. I've heard the story. But I mean, did you guys find anything To substantiate that, or...? No. What I did find, though, is that, At the same time that this supposedly happened, This house was actually used By the military during world war ii. So, there were no nuns here at all during that time. No. This was, like, either... It was a boys' school A girls's school, officers housing. But I didn't see anything about nuns inhabiting the space. I think we can put that one to rest. Okay. - Hey, hey. - Hey. Hey. How's it going? We've been digging into a lot of stuff, here. I mean, I just came across this one particular story. A woman named nina, supposedly having an affair With a gentleman named william Up on the third floor... The tower room. Right? So, amber... william's wife... Comes in, finds them. Right? Cut to the chase. Supposedly, she hung herself, and lit the room on fire. Right? Did she do it that way? Because that's impressive. That is an impressive woman. There are no records of a fire happening in here. Well, the place... It was dorms for college. I mean, they sat around, talk, made up stories Just to try to scare each other. And we know that. I mean, there's so many things that came out of that. It's ridiculous. Mm-hmm. So, anything else, though? Yeah. So, after we investigated last night, I just I went home, and just kept researching. I was looking at the bradleys. And so, obviously, julia bradley Was the woman who passed away in the house... Mrs. Bradley. Her daughter, julie, inherited it. Julie's husband was named herbert shipman. He was a chaplain in world war I. He was close enough with mrs. Bradley That she felt compelled To bring an entire chapel here just for him. And that's where her funeral was. I mean, if you think about it, you know, This reverend... Herbert shipman, He would be really upset, I feel like, If he saw someone doing something That he perceived as being, like, the dark arts, Or something, trying to bring Something negative into the space. I mean, and really, that idea kind of goes hand in hand With the evidence we caught last night. Oh, yeah. The whole "who's to say That is didn't bring something negative in?" And you get the "I do"... Which is 100% "I do." You hear it. There's no question. He would be the person to stop that. Well, great job. - Yeah. - Yeah. Nice seeing you getting back to your roots, huh? It's the "kindred spirits" effect. Yes. We like to throw in a plot twist. Alright. Let's get ready for tonight, guys. Encouraged by the audio evidence Of a potential active presence in the basement... So what's to say it doesn't bring in Something a bit darker, and negative? Shari and me going down to the basement, ...Shari and amy are starting tonight's investigation By returning down there, In hopes of drawing out the restless spirit. So, this is where they got the voice. So what's to say it doesn't bring in something A bit darker, and negative? I'm gonna place this... Perfect. ...Right there. So, we heard your voice, And you were telling us about the ceremony. Denise actually asked us to come here, And look for some answers for her. They want to make sure you're happy, Whoever you are. Did you hear that upstairs? Yeah. A bump. It almost sounded... It was like a big thump. Whoever is in the room with us right now... Can you tell us what your name is? Did you know mrs. Bradley? Is mr. Carey here? J to shari. Shari here. I'm just letting you know we... Steve and me Are coming down to join you two. Hey. Alright. Any luck. Anything fun going on? It's been quiet, Yeah. Yeah. What was that? We're at seaview terrace mansion In newport, rhode island, Investigating a surge of paranormal activity Plaguing homeowners chris and denise bettencourt. Chris claims he has felt invisible hands Physically touch him... Like I was being touched by 1,000 people at the same time. ...While denise has witnessed a fleeing shadow figure. I was startled. It put me on edge. That sounded like... Like a sack. Over our first two nights here, We've all had our own unexplained experiences Throughout the house. It was two full sentences. And now, we've zeroed in on something Trying to get our attention in the basement. What was that? - Wow. - Loud slam. I mean, that was substantial. Shall we ask...? Yeah. I mean, go ahead. Do you want to ask? That was percussive. J to dave. Go for dave. Dave, was there just a loud slam? Um, I had the headphones on. I did not hear anything. Adam did not hear anything. Alright. Adam, you guys heard a loud slam When you were down here, right? Correct. Alright. What area were you in when you when you heard that? Were you over near the tombstones, or at the other end? Exactly right in front of the wooden door That's near the tombstones. Alright. Thank you. Copy. That was incredibly loud. The whole place vibrated. Wow. Oh, god. I think this is where dave and adam... There was just a whisper, steve. Really? It was was like a... really quick. Let me give it a little emf sweep. I know from earlier, the base was about a 1.8, 1.5, And about 5.5 Hello? You don't have to whisper. You can just talk to us. Oh, that's interesting. I was getting a 1.5, 1.... See that? Oh, yeah. 1.8. 1.9. But it... Down here, it gets lower. What about above? What's this? 2.0. 2.2. Above, it get lower. So, it's just, like, hovering in the middle. Yes, it is. Look, 1.3 that way. J, this... this could be really awesome. That could also help explain why we got that whisper. Look, j. It goes just down that way. It goes down that way. Every single direction, it goes down. No joke. We can't see you, and I'm sorry for that. But if you are here with us right now, We can hear you, sometimes. Yeah. This is absolutely. This is this is exactly what we want. It's literally right here, steve. It's right here. What do you think of this? I don't know. I mean... Random hovering emf spike. Lower. Back to the center, Higher this way. Lower Back to the center. So strange. This way. Oh. Oh. Oh. That's okay. Oh. Back down. Back down. Is it growing? It's 2.3 here. 2.8. 2.9. What should we do with this, j? I mean, just document it. There's really not much we can do. Caught what sounded like a whisper, We caught that. That helps. Wait a second. It's going away? It's way lower, now. That's strange. Look. It's way lower, now. Yeah. S, it's dissipating. Realtime. It's realtime. It's not a burned in radiation. This is realtime, then. Right after that whisper. I'm telling you. It's half the strength it was. I've never seen that before. Yeah. Oh, here. Thank you, sir. So, adam and dave. We are in the organ room, Where was the symbol? - So, basically, Right in the middle, I would assume, right? Pretty much. Great. So, maybe, if we put this down here, Where it was, we can ask somebody about it, And see if we can get any interaction. It's a good idea, adam. This is the trigger object, is the box. We don't have anything else to put into it right now. Here we go. Good. Good job, adam. So, dave and I were downstairs in the basement earlier. And we were talking about something That was put into this room by an individual. It was a symbol, it was very large, And it was on the floor. Do you remember that? If that's true, can you touch that box... that red box, there? Supposedly, you're associated with the symbol. That's why we put this box on the floor, with the metal disc. That's where the symbol was. So, if you are associated with that symbol that was here, Can you please touch that red box? Can you repeat what was said downstairs? You can talk into that device, right there, on the on the desk. That was a whisper. Would you tell us who said that to us? Do you know? It was a male voice. We're trying to figure out who he is. He seems very protective, and strong, and... Martin, are you here? Are you the one that's looking after this building now? You know, I wonder if that was martin. He seems... I don't know. I mean, it seems like somebody to investigate, But I am so wary about looking down That rabbit hole of somebody who just passed away. Alright. Cool. Let's head out. Alright. Hey, if there's anybody here, my name's jason. This is my friend steve. Hi. We'd like to talk with you. These would be the dorm... Dorm rooms, right, I guess? I guess more dorm rooms, right? Right. Hello? Mr. Carey. Denise asked us to try to talk with you. She knows how much you love this property. Oh. Yeah. I know where we are. So, we've done some research. There's been a lot of rumors of this area. Supposedly, a nun hung herself. Not true. Supposedly, a lady burned the room down With her husband and mistress in it, And then hung herself. Not true. Can you tell us anything that did really happen in this room? Mrs. Bradley, Is there anything you can do to let us know that you're here? There was just a voice. Did you say "a voice"? Yeah. There was a voice. Oh. I just heard a whistle. I heard that. Exactly like that. Mrs. Bradley, Is there anything you can do to let us know that you're here? There was just a voice. Did you say "a voice"? Yeah. There was a voice. Oh. I just heard a whistle. I heard that. Exactly like that. You heard it, too, I heard that. Well, hey, man, that was loud enough. I'm almost positive we would have caught it. I would have caught it on this. Yeah. Alright. That's awesome. So, chris... Her husband... Was, like, coming through here, I think. Yeah. Felt like there were hands. He felt like there were hands, like, Pushing him, like, all over. I felt fingers touching the back of my neck and my head. Like I was being touched by 1,000 people at the same time. I ran to the master bedroom... And shut the door. And I didn't come out. I'm gonna walk through here, and just see if... I'm recording. If there's someone here who wants to push my friend, I can't reach him. So, if you want to do it for me. Oh, I've never... This is servants', y'all Amy, can you see a spider web? Do I see a spider web? Yeah. I need you to come check. Oh I mean, shoot. Okay. This is stupid. Do you see a spider web anywhere on this door? No. Why? Did you walk through a spider web? No. Because I went like this. And look how my arm is on this side. I went like this, And it felt like something touched the top of my arm. And then, I jumped away from it. Listen, if you touched me, that was okay. I did get a little startled, Only because I wasn't expecting it. But I'm here now. So, if you want to touch again, I'll know that it's happening. Okay, so, this is where chris got touched. I got gently touched on the arm. That's bizarre. That is really strange. - Hey, stevie. - Yo? This thing shoots all the way back, I don't know if I've ever been back here, In all the years I've been here, I didn't even know this was here. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You literally s... oh. That was a... that was a voice. It really sound like the word "not." But it was, like, "not." Really? Yeah, like a "not." Hello? Are you trying to tell us something? We're kind of trying to figure out who you are. A room full of antiques. Whoa. This is, like, a whole... J, do you think this is part of the house? Listen. Listen. Listen. J, do you think this is part of the house? Listen. Listen. Listen. Whoa. Like a deep nail. Wow. This is... Amazing. Listen. That was movement, 100%. Almost like it's shifting weight. It's frigging hot in here Really hot.. But this room is a... Hot spot. All around. Still reeling from the detection Of those bizarre energy fluctuations in the basement, Plus all the activity on the upper floors, The next morning, we review our recordings, While dave digs deeper into the history behind the two houses That were combined to form seaview terrace. Thank you so much. I really, really appreciate it. - Okay. - Alright. Bye. Bye. - Hey, guys. - Hey. How's it going? How's everyone doing? - Good. - Good. So, I have some information. I talked to a history expert By the name of stephen hanson. Julia bradley... We all know who she is... It was actually her idea to merge the houses, Because she thought it was bad luck To move into a new house. Imagine having that much money, She was like, "oh, I think it's bad luck. I'm gonna bring pieces of the d.C. House here." So, it wasn't just that she liked it. It was a superstition. So, we know that about her, which is pretty cool. Only the interior rooms of that house were moved here. Basically, in d.C., all you saw was a shell of that house. The venetian ceiling... that's, you know, the staircase... Came from the house of stanford white, Who was a millionaire architect. So, white was shot and killed by another millionaire By the name of harry thaw, at madison square garden... Which he also built. He built madison square garden? And he got killed in madison square garden by harry thaw. So, thaw accused white of seducing his wife. She was a famous actress by the name of evelyn nesbit. The murder was really big news... Really big news. And it was, like, the trial of the century. And he got right up to him, And shot him in the face twice, and in the shoulder. And people actually thought it was part of the theater play. There was, like, a theater thing going on there. They all thought it was just an act. - Oh, my god. - And he's laying there, dying. And then, they finally realize, "oh, you actually killed this guy." But besides that whole story, That's the original ceiling that he owned, that venetian. That's where the connection comes in. That's his, from his house. But I did some digging on my own, a little bit, About the structure, and the stained glass. The flagellation of christ. Originally, it was from the milan cathedral in Italy. That stained glass was made in 1545. There is one pane of glass between the legs of jesus. It's, like, a clear pane of glass. That's the only pane of glass That's been changed since it's been made. That's amazing. Wow. That's old. That's really, really old. And it was moved here. And moved here. It survived that trip from Italy. - That's cool. - That's fabulous. Does this, you think, pertain to what we're doing here? Like, how do you think we can use that information. It's a neat piece of history about the stuff in the house, And the house in general? Well, it's also history that demonstrates Your interest in the space. So, when you're investigating, if we talk about it, you know, If it is some of the original people Who built the home, they're gonna be like, "oh, wow, they've taken a genuine interest in this." They might be more apt to communicate. It could be the first time anything like that Has been brought up in god only knows how many years. - Good work. - Thanks, man. Nice. This place is slowly coming together, you know? We're starting to piece it all together. Understanding more and more piece by piece. Like the building. Yeah. And we'll start, and we'll be able to get investigating soon. Let's get this going, man. Nice work. The idea here is that we play organ music In the space that was the church. I say, beforehand, we, like, call out To mr. Shipman and mrs. Bradley, And and see if they want to join. The way that the acoustics are in here, I feel like it'll echo pretty well. And so, if we put it on this... The proximity sensor, see if it does something. Perfect. And I'll put the rem pot... So, then, you'll put your phone here, Playing the music. Let's call out a little bit. Herbert shipman... We'd love for you to give a little sermon, If you could, or say a few words. There's a lot going on in the world. I don't know if you know that. But... I think all of us here Could use some sort of encouragement. So, we'll play some music to kind of get everyone In the building to church. Call to worship. Okay. We'll step back. Okay. We'll step back. Don't touch it. If that's you, touch it again. Okay. I'm gonna stop it. Alright, so, mr. Shipman... Reverend shipman? Or, I'm not sure how to refer to you. What should I call you? That was pretty incredible. That was insane. 'cause as soon as we played the organ music, It was like bam. But honestly, like, I felt like, Almost, like that was applause, which is so strange. Yeah. And what's crazy is, like, I asked for it To do it again. And it did it right like that. Do you want us to play the music again? Yeah. Play it again. 'cause that was really interesting. So, I'm gonna play this again. And this room, This is actually where denise had her first experience. This handle, right here, she saw it move like this... Like, open and close, twice. I was in the master suite, And I decided to go out to the terrace. I went to open the door handle, And before I even touched it, The handle turned, and started opening by itself. It stopped me in my tracks. I stumbled back. I couldn't believe it. These are heavy metal doors. Wind could not have taken it. Ooh, that... look. That's loose. - Yeah. And it goes in and out this way. That could be interpreted as someone trying to open the door. She thought it was, like, somebody trying to do this, But it's just going like this. It's really windy outside, I mean... Right. Or... The wind theory might be it. You can see it jiggle. You can? Yeah. How about that? Still? It's jiggling. Yeah. Very light pressure. There's something there. I'm not saying that's what it is. But that's the closest thing I could think of, you know? Mrs. Bradley, if you're here with us, Can you make a noise, so we know you're here? Can you please turn this door handle, Like you've done for denise? Martin carey? Can you turn this door handle? Alright, let's... Give this room a break, maybe. Do you like that? Wow. That's pretty intense. That's crazy. That's... Okay. I mean... I have to stop it. Wait a second. Hold on. See, here's the thing. So, that's three times, on command, That that thing has gone off. I mean, that, to me, is confirmation That we are dealing, potentially, with mr. Shipman. J to amy. Go for amy. Are you still on the first floor right now? Yeah. We just did a crazy experiment, And had some wild results. Oh, hey, we see you. Hey. We're coming to you. What happened? Hey. So... So, crazy. Crazy. So, we were playing organ music in this space. And we we asked, "do you like this music?" And the rem pod goes "ping." immediately. And then, the last time... Every time we were like, "mr. Shipman, Do you want us to keep playing this music?" It was a break of the music, and I said, "do you like that?" And it went boom, immediately. So, I don't know. I mean... I love that it happened on command. You know, three times. Two is a coincidence. Three's a pattern. You know, you recognize that pattern. That's awesome. - Good job. - Good job. Let's finish going through all the recordings. We got a lot to tell chris and denise tomorrow. The striking setting of seaview terrace provided The perfect backdrop for one of our most personal cases. And after compiling all our evidence, We're ready to share our findings With the bettencourts. Hey, denise. Hey, chris. Hey. Thanks for letting us take over this property. We had so much fun. Such a great time. Thank you. Got it. But I know that there's been a spike in activity recently. Even before we set up the equipment, We started having things happen. You guys have had footsteps. Is somebody back there? We had this crazy light already happen. And then, this whole camera moving on its own. What is going... I just left there. That's three things, and we haven't even started investigating. Well, when we came in, you told us about the claims, And the person who drew the six-pointed star In the organ room. I was terrified that it had brought an entity, Or some sort of black force, into the house. We looked into that. It's funny, at one point, Adam was talking with dave in the basement, And brought up the fact of, "well, who's to say they didn't bring in Anything negative?" And crazy, but there was this male voice... What's to say it doesn't bring in something A bit darker, and negative? ...That came out, and it said, "I do." Wow. That's... that's wild. Here. I'm gonna play it right at that point. I heard that. I mean, if there is something here, It's saying that nothing negative is here. So, I think that's positive. It always felt like there was something protecting us. Martin, you're not down here, are you? We were getting a lot of direct responses. I mean, at one point, dave and adam Had a lot of activity in the basement. So, shari and amy headed down there. And steve and I headed down to join them, as well. And there was a voice, happened right in front of me. It was loud enough I caught it on my recorder. And shari, who was about 5 feet behind me, Caught it on hers. I did hear it Steve walked over there. And tell her about the emf. We found a free-floating energy fluctuation, or presence. It goes down that way. It goes down that way. Every single direction, it goes down. No joke. This is exactly what we want. We were able to discern that it was happening in realtime, And it moved. Right? And it seemed to respond to us, I'd say, even. Back to the center. This way. Oh. Oh. Is it growing? I've never really seen it like that. We were actually able to study it. It was absolutely phenomenal. Amazing. Wow. This is... this is... Well, I just like that it's doing that Because I heard the whisper. So, now, you add the two things together. - Pretty awesome. - So, one piece I did want to show you both, I know you just recently lost your father. You know, and we're very sorry for you. And I know you wanted us to reach out. Steve and I were in the the ballroom area. And we are trying to make contact. Martin? Mr. Carey? Your daughter, denise, asked us to come and... Check out the house. And during that time, about five seconds after that, You know, there was a buzz that went by. And truly, I thought it was a bug. Steve was right there. And I whacked at my ear. I said, "a bug keeps on trying to fly in my ear." A frigging bug flying around my head, or something. I don't see a bug. It went by my ear twice. There's a voice that came through. Now, I'm not... I can't say who it is, But I know what it sounds like is being said. Is there anything you'd like to say to denise? Maybe to her husband, chris? Is there anything you'd like to say to denise? Maybe to her husband, chris? Yeah, I could hear that. I'll play that part again. I... yeah, I hear the "chris" part. You know what's funny? He used to say that in new york. "where's chris? Where's chris? Where's chris?" Had to always be out doing something, you know, On one of the properties... Fixing this, or checking this out, Or meeting somebody. "where's chris?" There was a ton of activity. We had some incredible stuff, all positive. And I mean, thanks so much for calling us out. And you know, we're we're only a half hour away from you. We'll come back. We'll check this place out anytime. - So good to see you guys. - We'll talk soon. - Take care. - You, too. We believe that a property this grand, With such a long and storied past, Could certainly harbor attachments From those who once called it home. And we hope the current owners, Whose love for seaview terrace is clear, Continue to feel protected by these walls And the spirits that echo within.
