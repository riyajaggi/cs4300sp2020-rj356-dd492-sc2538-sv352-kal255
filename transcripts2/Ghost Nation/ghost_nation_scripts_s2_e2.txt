 That was a loud male voice. "Hallowed be thy name." We're not alone. Can you let us know that you're here? What the hell? "There is something else in this house." Make some sort of a noise. Let us know you're here with us. I'm right beside you. We are a community of searchers. This family is under attack. We are... ..."Ghost Nation." We've traveled to the village of Waynesville, Ohio,

 to investigate some unusual claims coming out of a former Catholic church. The local investigator who called us in to help on this case is an established member of UPRO, who teaches a weekly class on the paranormal at a museum in the heart of town. People see this, and they think, "Oh, it's a camcorder." Well, it's not just a camcorder. It's a full-spectrum camcorder, so this actually sees what our eyes can't see. I got some special friends that I'd like to introduce you to. We got Steve Gonsalves, Jason Hawes. We have Dave Tango. Guys? What sort of advice can you offer to the class? I would say don't think everything is a ghost, you know? Have your common sense and wits about you and knowing what you're looking at. I agree, and just go in understanding that most claims are able to be disproved as something else. Bring a flashlight, number one. Don't trip. Thanks again for coming out. Adam and Jona Powell is the client's name. They've been having a lot of activity going on. From what you said, this is a church being converted into a house? Yes. They bought it as their dream home, plus her business. Doing the investigation, I had the thermal. We were outside by the shrine, and this was sitting inside. That was inside the shrine? Yes. Almost looks like the arms are crossed or something. So, that's it inside, and I actually got a EVP. We were in the basement, and I'll share this with you. Where did you go? What I got is, "Hey, help me," like, "Help me, hey." It's, like, using any energy it can to get it out. Scroll back to the beginning. You'll hear it. Listen. Where did you go? Hello? You said that a sensitive had picked up some stuff. I had my medium come in. He walked the building. He actually picked up a priest in the '30s -- 1930s. Hmm. Did he pick up a name with this priest? Yes. Jim. Okay. And then he picked up a boy about 8, 10 years old, named Thomas, picked him up in the basement. Everybody has different feelings on sensitives. I actually saw the little boy. My medium was saying that Priest Jim was having an affair with someone. From this town? From this town. Okay. And Thomas was his son. So, did the boy supposedly die at the location? He picked up that the boy had a tragic accident in the basement, and that's where he passed. So, what do the family think is going on? They believe the activity is being caused by the priest, Jim, and the little boy, Thomas. They put all their heart and soul into this building to make it their home, into their business, and the 18-year-old daughter doesn't even stay on the property. She stays with the grandma. Okay. How close is the place? From here, it's just a half a mile down the road. You want to ride with us? Sounds good. Here we are, guys. It's right there. Oh, it looks like a church. Yeah. We're meeting with Adam and Jona Powell in the main church area of their property that they've converted into an antique shop and a printing business. Hey, how are you? I'm Jason. It's our job to get to the bottom of the disturbances that are terrifying this family. Welcome. Come on in. All right. So, this is obviously what was the church and is now your shop. Have either of you had any experiences with the paranormal prior to coming here? No. Oh, no. Did you believe in it before coming here? Kind of skeptical, to be honest. Actually, a big skeptic. This place kind of changed my mind. You know, we've always said that a skeptic is just somebody who's never had a paranormal experience yet. When we bought this building, we loved the history surrounding it. We knew it was a church built in 1877. The architecture was beautiful -- the original floors. It was everything my wife and I wanted. It was her dream house. The plan was to renovate the church here so that we could live in the church and run our business out of it. I started doing renovations. That's when all hell broke loose. Within a week, we started hearing footsteps... ...whispers... ...elevating from there to shadows. The most active area is the main church area. We'll hear candles drop and bang and then roll across the floor. We'd always hear the front door opening and closing. Each door has a 4-pound counterweight, so they should not be able to open, but on a regular basis, we'll hear these doors open and close on their own. The activity in our house could be one of the priests that was here. Being an old church, it makes sense that they were attached to this building. One of the most active areas is in the basement. We've also heard a young child crying. There's a shrine that was built with the church in 1877 in the backyard. And we hear voices by it. We brought in Lee, a local paranormal investigator. During an investigation, it was rather cold outside that evening, and that's when we picked up the thermal image... ...that was in the shape of a priest. It was startling. And nobody was standing there. It was just empty space. As part of Lee's investigation, he brought in a medium. And the medium sensed the priest had an illegitimate child named Thomas... out of shame and guilt, the priest locked the child away in the basement... ...he kept the boy a total secret, hidden away, and that the child died of an accident at a young age. My wife runs a small print business out of this church. One night, I was printing shirts, and I just felt completely uncomfortable. Somebody was watching me. I knew I was not alone. I was standing up at the press, and all of a sudden, I just felt a huge rush come up behind me, and I felt something sharp on my arm. I pulled back my sleeve, and there was this long scratch mark. Adam and I both watched it turn red, so we knew it had just happened. It was terrifying. The activity has escalated so much that now, it's coming after me. There's something trapped here, and we're not alone. The most traumatic thing of this whole experience is our oldest daughter won't live with us because she's terrified. It's been devastating, knowing that you are not providing your child with a safe home. That's what's parents do, and we are not doing that, so that's why we need help. We cannot go on living like this. I heard that you guys also had a sensitive come in? When the medium came in, he actually came up with Jim. Okay, so he didn't come up with a last name. It was just the first. Mm-hmm. So, then we reached out to the archdiocese and got a list of priests that was assigned to this location. In the 1920s, - there was actually a priest named James O'Brien. - James O'Brien. That had been in this church prior. What are you all hoping that we're able to accomplish here for you? We want to know if we're safe, because it's getting physical. We want to know what's here. We want to be comfortable in our own house, basically, you know? Right now, we're not. We'll do everything we can for you. Thank you for your help. Thank you very much. The Powells have agreed to close up shop and vacate the property for a week so we can investigate the paranormal activity they're experiencing and analyze the evidence that Lee has collected. Plug it in over here, Dave. We're going to set up a camera in each of the paranormal hot spots... Just make sure the I.R. doesn't blast each other. ...one in the main church... Ready to connect. ...one in the basement... Dave, we can put it over there 'cause this is where they saw it. ...and in the backyard. You can cover a wide area. Longtime paranormal investigator Shari DeBenedetti has joined our team to help monitor cameras and review evidence. Awesome. While Shari keeps an eye on the monitors... Let's do it! To the basement! ...Tango is heading down to the basement to look for evidence that supports the crying heard by the homeowners... This is Tango in the basement. ...and the EVP that Lee recorded. Hello? Is your name Thomas? It's really no place for a little boy to be. If your name is Thomas, can you let me know somehow? Are you trapped down here? Jay and Steve, heading into a church -- Waynesville, Ohio. In here we have the main area. This is the room where Jona was scratched. Jim O'Brien? Is there a reason that you're in this church? Was that you that scratched Jona? Were you trying to get her attention? Are you here with us, James O'Brien? Are you living in this church? We're not here to bother you, scare you. We're not even here to ask you to leave. Hello? That was a sentence -- like, a full sentence. We're not here to bother you, scare you. We're not even here to ask you to leave. Hello? That was a sentence, like, a full sentence. That was a loud male voice. Let me just make sure no one's next to the front door. Whoo! It's like every hair on the back of my neck standing up. I mean, this would be the only place sound could have traveled in from. Nobody. All right. That was a sentence -- like a full sentence. That was **** loud. That was loud. There is nobody outside, Jay, at all. Dude, my **** hands are shaking. We're not here to bother you, scare you. We're not even here to ask you to leave. Jay to Dave. Can you come up to the main church area for a second? Yeah, I'm on my way. Man, I would love to know what it says. If we could figure out what it's saying, I mean, that legitimately could change the course of our investigation. Hey. There was a voice. What? And it's frigging loud. What? You can hear it? You got it on recorder? Yeah. Wow. I think we're gonna go in there and listen to it. All right. Great. I want to hear this. We're not even here to ask you to leave. "Hallowed be thy name." "Hallowed be thy name." Oh, my God. There's no way you could pick it up like this. Play it again. Holy ****. Holy ****. That's clear as hell. Holy ****. That was loud. That was extremely loud. Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Yeah. After recording a disembodied voice saying a line from the Lord's Prayer during last night's investigation, we sent Tango out to see what information he can find about the priest and child whose presence Lee's sensitive picked up. Meanwhile, Steve and I will check out the counterweight on the front door that the Powells claimed to hear opening and shutting on its own. John? Thank you so much for meeting me. I really appreciate it. You know why I'm here. We're trying to help a family out. They're having some strange occurrences in their home. The family themselves did some research, and they found the name James O'Brien. Do you know this name at all? Was this an actual priest? I'm familiar with that name from historical readings. I assume he was a priest here, but I can't tell you for sure because that was before my time. Right. The priest, Jim -- now maybe James O'Brien -- had an affair, had a child, kept that child secret in the basement. Is there any truth to that at all? That's a pretty serious accusation. I can't confirm that's true or not true. Okay. Any historical records we have at this point would be in the office. We've just cleaned out our library, but I'm certain that you're more than welcome to take a look in there if you so desire. I would appreciate that very much. Okay. Do you think this piece of wood might ever get crooked and get stuck in this? Oh, absolutely. Hello. Hi. I heard that you were doing an investigation in town. Well, thanks for stopping by. There's rumors all over town about ghosts in every building. Anything you can tell us about this area? Yes. In 1879, a horrible thing happened here in Waynesville. Three women were ax-murdered... and had their throats slit. Ooh! The mystery of this whole thing revolves around a young man named Willie Anderson, his mother, her sister, and daughter. Willie went in the house and ax-murdered these three women. The bodies were still in the house for a week until they pried open the doors and the windows, and they said it was the most ghastly thing they'd ever seen. Could never get the blood out of the floorboards. Next morning, the railroad people found Willie shot in the head, and they said it was suicide. And how far is that from here, do you think? Down this street, and it's three or four doors down. It's literally just a rock's throw right over there. Hey, hold on a second. - I'm gonna put you on speakerphone. - Okay. I got Tango here. So, I got some information. There is an actual James O'Brien. So, what years was he actually here at this church? 1936 and '37. Okay, and the psychic said the child was, what, 8 years old? Eight. That would mean he would have had to have had the child, what, in 1928? Right. But where was he in 1928? I actually found the obituary for James O'Brien. During the time he was supposed to have a secret child, he was posted in Switzerland. In 1928? Right. The whole time line just does not match up. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. Yeah, and how do you hide a kid for 8 years? It's funny. We had one of the neighbors over here show up while Steve and I were checking out the door, but she told us about a murder, a triple ax murder that happened in 1879 only about 100 yards from this building. Oh, my God. Let's use that tonight and see what happens. I agree. All right. See you soon, buddy. All right. See you soon. She was selling a lot of that information. It's a classic case of taking what a sensitive said and taking it as fact... And running with it. ...and running with it when there's no fact behind it. Hey, Willie! Are you here? We'd really like to talk to you about some things that you did. We're in Waynesville, Ohio, investigating a former Catholic church that the Powells purchased to remodel into their dream home and family business. Welcome. Come on in. But frightening, unexplained activity has torn this family apart. Our oldest daughter -- she won't live with us because she's terrified. The Powells believe what they are experiencing is caused by the spirits of a priest and his illegitimate son, who was trapped on the property. The child died of an accident at a young age. But our research uncovered a conflict in the time line of events, allowing us to rule out this possibility. During the time he was supposed to have a secret child, he was posted in Switzerland. We then learned about a triple ax murder... ...that happened in a home right nearby back in 1879. Just blood soaked everything. So, now we're trying to contact the murderer, Willie Anderson. Hey, Willie. Are you here? We'd really like to talk to you about some things that you did. Willie? We know that you see this as a church. Are you maybe here to try to get some forgiveness for what you did? Um... This was in the garage, right? And they were killed with an ax. Willie, we have an object that you are familiar with, I'm sure. You see what my friend Steve here has in his hands? This has likeness of the weapon that you used when you chopped up your family. Willie, what you did was horrendous. Willie, we'd like to know how this ax makes you feel. Can you take it from me? This place seems like it's pretty active. It does. So, there's a good chance -- hopefully, a good chance -- that we caught something on the recorder. Yeah, well, let's let it keep rolling. After reviewing our evidence from last night's investigation, we decided to dig deeper into the history of this town and the Powells' property. Our research has led us to a local historian whose family traces back to the earliest days of Waynesville. Milton? Yeah. Its nice to meet you. I'm Dave. Pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. Thank you for making some time to meet up with us. We're helping the Powell family, and we're just wondering a lot about the property and the area. Well, the Quakers first moved to Waynesville in the early 1800s. They moved from North Carolina and South Carolina to get away from slavery. Then -- 1807, Samuel Rogers bought the property you're looking into. Now, the Rogers family -- were they Quakers? When they first moved to Waynesville, they were Quakers. His son Joseph died of cholera when cholera hit Waynesville. Hmm. And he lost his cousin Seth from cholera when he was only 2. The Rogers family lost six people. Oh, geez. So, when was the land sold for that church to be built, then? After Samuel died, his son sold the land to the archdiocese in 1877. And that's when the church was built? Yes. Milton, thank you so much for taking the time out of your day. You're welcome. This is gonna be very valuable. The Rogers family were Quakers, and it makes you wonder, though. I mean, that thermal that Lee caught that he believes to be a guy in a robe, I mean, Quakers' attire -- were they dressed that way? Were they dressed in robes? Picture Pilgrims. That's exactly what they look like -- Quakers. That's exactly how they dressed, same kind of hats. I mean, we could see this hat here. I mean, in the thermal, could that shape be one of those type of hats? I think later tonight, we should try to re-create that, use our thermal, put on a jacket and throw on a hood... Sure. ...and see how it really radiates. That's a great idea. The details that Milton shared about the Powell property have added new pieces to this ever-growing puzzle. Okay, let's head to the shrine. We're going to try to re-create the thermal image Lee captured. If a person in similar clothing can generate a heat signature with this shape and intensity, but we know no one was actually there... It was startling, and nobody was standing there. It was just empty space. ...this adds credibility to Lee's evidence, and given the Rogers' family history here, maybe the image wasn't a priest at all, but a Quaker. So, do you want to do this? And then he'll go out, and then I'll stand by you. Yes, I'll do this. Okay. You can actually look around on this, too. Yeah, I'm watching this. Cool. You think this way, or... Yeah. Now, Dave, if you maybe want to turn around and kneel. Right, 'cause they would be praying towards it. Right. And maybe kneel a little, if you could? It's close. It's close. Would you turn your body to your left? Yep, a little more. There, you look like you're onto something. Would you just turn in the same position but face us? Oh, there it is. Ohh! Is it, yeah? Lee, you might be onto something out here. Yeah. I'm telling you what. That's it. But where I was standing was back here. Right there is where I caught that. We're at the shrine in the Powell property's backyard, attempting to re-create and authenticate a thermal image that Lee captured. So, do you want to do this? And then he'll go out? Yes. You think this way, or... Yeah. Now, Dave, if you maybe want to turn around and kneel. Right, 'cause they would be praying towards it. Right. And maybe kneel a little, if you could? It's close. It's close. Would you turn your body in the same position but face us? Wow. Let me reference this. Ohh! That's close, man. Wow! There you go. Wow. That's the original, our re-creation. Wow, yeah. To me, it looks just like it. Yeah. Wow. That is awesome. The image we caught indicates that the haunting could be attributed to the Rogers family of Quakers, so we join Jason back inside to try to draw out members of that family, who we'd learned had died here from cholera. All right. You see that mister shooting near that mirror. That's pretty wild. This big, thick cloud comes up on it. See, now this is when this technique works great. Watch -- I walk through this, and look what the mist does. Yeah, it just displaces with you. Exactly, and that's what we're looking for. Yeah, because it doesn't have to be visible to our eyes. That's absolutely right. So, this is the area where Adam and Jona hear the most voices. Is there anyone from the Rogers family here with us? Are you here with us, Samuel? Joseph, are you here with us? Hello? Don't... What the hell? Wow. There's nobody there. I'm gonna crap my pants. Hello? Don't... What the hell? There's nobody there. I'm gonna crap my pants. Are you kidding me? There's nobody there. Are you kidding me right now? Are you kidding me right now? That was even... That was good. We even heard the bell! That was force! Was it this door or that door? It was the left door, I think. I don't -- This one doesn't have a bell. It was this one. That's the one. That's it. There's the bell. This one. You -- kidding me. Oh, my God! No way. So, think of it this way, though -- we've always said human spirits are limited with the abilities that they're able to -- So, moving small objects, usually under 3 pounds, so if something could just give this just enough of a tug... Right. Nobody was over next to this door. We instantly looked. There was no one there. Nobody there. That's true! I know! I looked! We instantly looked! We all looked at the same time. We pretty much ran to the door. Dude, that was fun. That was nice. Wow. Oh. We know that most of the Rogers family who were on this property died of cholera. Seth Rogers, are you here with us? We can only imagine what you were going through when you were sick. Look at this thing. Look in here. Wait a second. That's... Oh. It looked like it was dispersing - around something there for a minute. - It did. Like that -- It's doing it again. Oh, I see it. Yeah, it looks like it's going around. Oh, wait, that's not the back of the -- No, it looks like it's going around something small. Is that a void around the mist? I think that's exactly what's going on. Give me the EMF. So, I'll stay -- Keep the light on it, Dave. EMF's dropping. 0.6, 0.5, Ah, that was weird 'cause it looked like -- like right here. Ooh, come here. That's a weird, staticky feeling. Look, right here. Do you think that's the mist? It feels colder, though. Now it's, like, really cold right there. It does feel colder right here, yeah. Now it's here. Now it's here. Now it's further ahead. Feel right here, compared to right there. Oh, now it's here. Now it's here. Feel here. Oh, wait a second. That's... Oh, right here? Right here. Yeah. That is cold, compared to everything else. It moved. Dave, you're right! Yeah. Right here it is really cold! That's like 10 degrees colder. What the hell? That's crazy. I mean, cold is only the absence of heat, so something is removing the heat here. You can see it being blocked. Oh, yeah. You can see it being blocked right there. Something is going on in this place. The Powell property presented us with a very perplexing case. After reviewing all the video and audio evidence captured during the investigation, we're ready to share our findings with Adam, Jona, and their daughters. Hey, Jona, Adam, thanks for having us back. I'm glad you came. Thank you. You guys were telling us about how this was your dream house. You guys wanted to take this church and convert it into a home. Throughout the course of us being here, we did have some strange things that happened. Adam and Jona believe the spirits of a priest, Jim O'Brien, and his illegitimate son, Thomas, could be the source of their paranormal phenomena, so we focused our first night's investigation on these subjects. Are you here with us, Jim O'Brien? We looked further into the rumor of the priest who allegedly kept his son trapped on the property. The time lines were completely off. During that time, that father would have actually been in Switzerland. While continuing our investigation, we were presented with another possible suspect. The mystery of this whole thing revolves around a young man named Willie Anderson. Three women were ax-murdered. Can you take this ax from me? We tried a lot of techniques, and we had no results, so we firmly believe that what happened over there is not here. Okay, good. Yeah. Our research into the Powell property next led us to a local farmer with a rich knowledge of the town's history. There was a cholera epidemic, and the Rogers family lost six people. This made us wonder if the thermal image Lee captured by the shrine may be that of the original landowner, a Quaker named Samuel Rogers. So this here is the original. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. And then that was our re-creation. Wow. That's cool. That looks like it is some sort of free-floating tangible energy that is over there. After learning of the cholera outbreak that decimated the Rogers family, we reached out to other members who perished on the property... Seth Rogers, are you here with us? ...and finally made contact. Ooh, come here. That's, like, really cold right there. It does feel colder right here. It was about this high, which was strange because that's about the height of a 2-year-old. The discovery of the cold spot, along with the EVP that Lee captured... ...leads us to believe that these could indeed be members of the Rogers family who died here during the outbreak. The Powell family also claimed to hear the front door open and close on its own several times a day. We were standing over here, and the door opened and closed, and there was absolutely nobody here. Don't... What the hell? We didn't see the door move. We heard it move. So it could be a residual-type sound. One of the most mind-blowing things was, at one point, Steve and I heard a really loud voice. Wow. Now take a listen. Oh, my God. That was what you heard? That's what we heard. Wow. So, what do you think that's saying? - "Hallowed be thy name"? - You heard it that clear? That's exactly what Dave heard. We heard it with our ears, so this is a disembodied sound in the room with us. Could be what we call a layered haunting, where there could be a residual type of haunting, which could be the "Hallowed be thy name," could be the door. It's easy to have more than one type of haunting. You have the Rogers family. You have the cold spot. That's an intelligent-type haunt, and I know some of the concern was also the scratch on your arm. When your body flushes with adrenaline and with emotion, you may not quite have remembered perhaps brushing your arm on something. We're sort of thinking that it might be more environmental than something paranormal. What really struck us most is having children that don't even want to be in here. That's a sad thing. This should be a place of comfort, of fun, of family, of love. There's nothing here that we feel is going to hurt you or cause any of you harm. I think you got a great place here, and it's got paranormal activity, but it's paranormal activity that seems to be people who love the place as well as you guys do. Anything happens or you guys feel threatened, Lee's got a direct line to us. We'll come right back. I feel so much more comfortable in our own home. That's a huge help. Thank you. The storied past of this 19th-century church and the tragedy that proceeded it makes the property a prime location for paranormal activity, but we hope our findings can help reunite the Powell family under one roof -- a roof that previously brought so many others together.
