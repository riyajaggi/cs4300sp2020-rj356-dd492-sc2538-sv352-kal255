 Soper: WELL, WE RESET EVERYTHING KIND OF IN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AREA, AND THIS IS THE FIRST POT. IT'S GOT 27 HOURS ON IT. AND KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. WHOO! YEAH! [ LAUGHING ] THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. WHOO! YEAH! GOD, IT'S NICE TO SEE POTS FULL OF CRAB AGAIN. HERE'S A NICE POT. IT MAKES EVERYTHING WORTH IT. WHOO! BIG. EVERYBODY LOVES IT WHEN YOU GOT A TABLEFUL OF CRAB. Narrator: NOW THAT THE SKIPPER'S LANDED ON THE CRAB, THE NEW HORN, COOPER WEATHERBY, WILL HAVE TO WORK IN OVERDRIVE AND WITHOUT COMPLAINT... THAT IS, IF HE WANTS TO IMPRESS DECK BOSS GARY SOPER. [ LAUGHS ] RIGHT ON? HEY, YOU KNOW? THIS LINE OF WORK, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT FOR THE WEAKHEARTED. Soper: THE GIRLS ARE DOING GOOD. I WOULD BE GIVING THEM A PAT ON THE BACK, BUT I DON'T GIVE GREENHORNS PATS ON THE BACK ANYMORE. THEY DESERVE... THE FOOD THAT THEY GET, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT. MAYBE WE'LL THROW A LITTLE SLEEP ON TOP. IT'S WEARING ON ME. IT'S COLD OUT HERE. IT'S ICY. AND WE'RE MOVING UP AND DOWN LIKE CRAZY, SO... IT'S LIKE TRYING TO THROW POTS OFF A ROLLER COASTER. SEE, YOU TOSS THESE IN THERE. SEE THAT? YOU WANT -- OKAY, HOLD ON. WHEN YOU GET THAT IN THERE... GIVE THAT A GOOD PU-- SEE ALL THE SLACK I GOT OUT OF THAT? BRING IT OVER HERE. YOU NEED THAT BITE RIGHT THERE, OKAY? IN THREE DAYS -- YOU KNOW WHAT? -- COOPER WILL PROBABLY BE BETTER THAN HE IS TODAY. Narrator: COOPER MAY NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE YET... BUT HE WORKS HARD AND TRIES HARD, SO... ...BUT HE'S GOT THE HUSTLE. ...WE'LL SEE. 90 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST, THE NORTHWESTERN HAS SPENT THE LAST 18 HOURS SKIRTING THE LEAD EDGE OF THE ICE PACK. GOT 17 LEFT. IT'S RIGHT HERE. CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN HAS BEEN FORCED OUT OF A CRAB BONANZA BY A FAST-MOVING, 300-SQUARE-MILE ICE FLOE THAT'S THREATENING TO SWALLOW HIS GEAR. Sig: NOW, WHEN YOU SEE PANCAKE ICE LIKE THIS, WHEN YOU SEE THE FIRST SIGN OF THE STRIPS AND YOU'VE GOT NORTHERLY WINDS, I MEAN, IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S TALKING TO YOU, AND IT'S TELLING YOU, MAN, "THIS IS YOUR FIRST WARNING. THIS IS ALL I'M GONNA GIVE YOU," YOU KNOW? "AND IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, I WILL KICK YOUR ASS." YOU KNOW? THERE IT IS. AND I'LL TAKE THE WARNING. MY NAME'S EDGAR HANSEN. WELCOME TO MY HELL. Narrator: THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, SIG'S CREW HAS WORKED WITHOUT A BREAK. AND IN BETWEEN HOURS OF RELENTLESS ICE-BASHING, THE CREW RACED TO HAUL AND STACK ON 65 POTS, ALL THE WHILE ABANDONING SOME OF THE RICHEST FISHING THEY HAD SEEN IN YEARS. Sig: WE'VE BEEN SETTING THIS THING BACK SINCE I STARTED MY SEASON, AND I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD LESS THAN A 600 AVERAGE TO 700 AVERAGE OUT OF THIS AREA ONCE. Narrator: NOW, EVEN WITH THE ICE PACK LESS THAN ONE MILE FROM SIG'S GEAR, MOVING THE POTS IS STILL A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW. I MEAN, IT SUCKS, YOU KNOW, LAST TRIP, WE GOT TO ADD SHOTS AND MOVE THE GEAR JUST FOR THE LAST LITTLE BIT, LAST LITTLE TANK. THAT'S FISHING, YOU KNOW? THE ICE IS COMING. YOU GOT TO GET THEM OUT. I DON'T FEEL LIKE SPENDING MY OFF TIME UP HERE FOR A MONTH, DIGGING POTS OUT. OOH. THE GUYS ARE PRETTY UPSET, MAN. THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, BUT IT'S -- IT'S UPSETTING. IT'S SADDENING TO HAVE TO STACK THESE. Narrator: THE FIVE-MAN ZOMBIE CREW IS LOOKING AT ANOTHER 18 HOURS OF WORK BEFORE THEY CAN HIT THE RACKS FOR A THREE-HOUR SNOOZE. Edgar: TICKETS TO THE PROMISED LAND. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I'LL SIT THERE AND JUSTIFY IT AND SECOND-GUESS MYSELF ALL DAY LONG. I PROBABLY WILL BE DOING THAT ALL THE WAY UNTIL I FINALLY FIND CRAB OUT ON THE OTHER STUFF THAT I SET. THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. THAT'S ABOUT 120,000 POUNDS WE'VE PUT IN THIS BOAT, GOING THROUGH THOSE 158 POTS. THAT'S A LOT OF CRAB, MAN. THAT'S 200 GRAND IN LESS THAN A DAY. SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER 200 GRAND. THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE CRAB OUT THERE. Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... SHE'S PISSED OFF OUT THERE. Narrator: 255 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, CORNELIA MARIE RELIEF CAPTAIN MURRAY GAMRATH CONTINUES TO PINCH-HIT FOR PHIL HARRIS. AND WITH A MONSTER DELIVERY IN JUST SIX DAYS, HE'S LOOKING TO HIT A HOME RUN. DAD, DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING. MURRAY IS A [BLEEP] SLAVE DRIVER, BUT WE LOVE HIM. WE GOT FAITH IN OUR CAPTAIN BECAUSE, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE WIRE, WITHIN THREE DAYS, IF WE DON'T HAVE AT LEAST 150,000, WE'RE GONNA BE HAULING [BLEEP] NONSTOP, GUARANTEED. [ LAUGHS ] EITHER WAYS, WE'RE GONNA GO PULL ON 180,000 POUNDS AND BRING IT IN. YOU KNOW, AND NOW THE REALITY OF IT HAS HIT HIM, THAT HE'S NOT COMING BACK FOR OPIES. IT'S GOT TO BE A STRANGE FEELING FOR HIM. SHE'S PISSED OFF OUT THERE. WHOO! YEAH! UH-HUH! WHAT DID I JUST SAY?! UH-HUH! Gamrath: IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE ABOUT A 15- TO 16-FOOT SEA WITH ABOUT 35 TO STILL 40 KNOTS OF WIND. [BLEEP] UP. Narrator: ON THE LAST TRIP, GREENHORN DAN DECKER PULLED HIS WEIGHT AND HELPED THE CREW HAUL IN THE 152,000 POUNDS THEY NEEDED. Decker: REMEMBER HOW I SAY DAY TWO IS HELL? TODAY IS THAT DAY. Narrator: BUT FOR THIS TRIP, MURRAY HAS STACKED THE DECK, REENLISTING A TRUSTED DECKHAND AND FRIEND, MARK ANDERSON. AFTER SURVIVING A NEARLY FATAL FALL IN THE OFF-SEASON, MARK IS FINALLY WELL ENOUGH TO RETURN TO HIS HOME ON THE CORNELIA MARIE HYDROS. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] BUT THE YEAR HIATUS HAS LEFT MARK A LITTLE RUSTY. A SLIGHT MISCALCULATION SENDS THE 800-POUND POT SPINNING WILDLY. YEE-HAW. THIS IS ONLY HIS THIRD POT IN A LONG TIME. SO, HE'S DOING FINE. THAT'S THE ONE THING I DIDN'T MISS, WAS THAT [BLEEP] SLAPPING OVER THE RAIL. ROCK 'N' ROLL. ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE. Narrator: 40 MILES TO THE NORTH... ON THE NORTH AMERICAN... CAPTAIN STEN SKAAR PREPARES TO HAUL WHAT COULD BE THE LAST STRING OF THE SEASON. WE HAVE ABOUT 20,000 MORE TO GO. IF THESE NUMBERS KEEP UP, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. THIS IS THE LAST TIME... THESE HORNS WILL EXIST. HERE WE GO. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] JACKPOT! [ CHEERING ] JACKPOT! THAT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT A 400. THAT WAS A NICE POT. MAN. Narrator: EACH POT CLEARING THE RAIL BRINGS STEN 700 POUNDS CLOSER TO HIS QUOTA. AND IF THE SKIPPER CAN KEEP THIS AVERAGE OF 465 KEEPERS, STEN WILL HAVE HIS QUOTA IN THE NEXT 29 POTS. BUT WE'RE THAT CLOSE TO GOING HOME, MAN. WE JUST WANT TO GET IT OVER WITH, GO HOME AND SEE OUR FAMILIES. Narrator: WHILE CAPTAIN STEN HAS PROVEN HE CAN STILL CATCH THE CRAB... LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE ON OUR WAY HOME TONIGHT. Narrator: ...THE JURY IS STILL OUT FOR 27-YEAR-OLD GREENHORN DEBO. John: I DON'T REALLY SEE MUCH IMPROVEMENT. I HONESTLY DON'T. HE'S JUST HUFFING AND PUFFING. HE STILL HASN'T STOPPED SMOKING. AND, YOU KNOW... HE'S JUST BREATHING HEAVY, WHATEVER HE DOES. [ GRUNTS ] Labay: I'M NOT USED TO, LIKE, ALL THIS LABOR, BUT... I PULL THROUGH. Narrator: COMING UP, A LUCKY STREAK... I WOULD EAT THAT CRAB! THAT'S HOW NICE THEY ARE! Narrator: ...TURNS DEADLY. [ GROANS ] [BLEEP] Jake: WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT! Narrator: 290 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, ON THE NORTHWESTERN... AFTER A GRUELING 36-HOUR POT-RESCUING MISSION, CAPTAIN SIG HAS FINISHED MOVING ALL $100,000 WORTH OF GEAR TO SAFER GROUNDS. WE BASICALLY WENT ON A RESCUE MISSION TO GET OUR GEAR OUT OF THE ICE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO STAY A STEP AHEAD OF THE ICE. AND I WASN'T TOO CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE I PUT THE POTS AS MUCH AS GETTING THE POTS OUT OF HARM'S WAY. Narrator: NOW INSTEAD OF A PROMISED REST, THE CREW MUST CONTEND WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF ICE THAT HAS COMPLETELY ENCASED THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. ADAM IS TRYING TO REMOVE THE ICE ON OUR TAG PHONE. WE'VE GOT RECEPTION PROBLEMS WITH IT. AND HOPEFULLY, IT'S JUST AN ICE PROBLEM. Edgar: GET A LITTLE WEIGHT OFF THE BLOCK. THE BLOCK WEIGHS PROBABLY TWICE AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD. EVERY OUNCE OF WATER THAT HITS THIS BOAT, THE SPRAY THAT WE MAKE, IT STICKS LIKE GLUE. THE BOAT'S LIKE AN ICE MAGNET. AND ALL THAT ICE WEIGHS A LOT. AND THAT'S THE DANGER -- THE BOAT BECOMES TOP-HEAVY. WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS, SHE CAN ROLL OVER AND SINK. THIS IS WHEN FISHING IS PROBABLY AT ITS WORST. WE WENT THROUGH OUR GEAR, RESET IT, AND NOW WE'RE GONNA PICK THE FIRST STRING. WE SET EVERYTHING IN THE BLIND, SO... IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING. MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY AGAIN, BUT NOW THAT I SAID THAT, I'LL PROBABLY JINX MYSELF, HUH? I'LL JUST SHUT UP. OKAY, FIRST POT COMING UP. BRING IT UP! HA HA! WHOO-HOO! AH, THERE'S SOME LIFE IN IT. GIVE ME A TURN! IT'S ALL RIGHT. HE'LL GET HIS. HOW DOES IT LOOK? GOOD! THEY LOOK PRETTY GOOD? THEY SEEM A LITTLE DARK. ARE THEY? LITTLE BIT. LITTLE BIT? THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT CRAB. IT'S PERFECT. NO PROBLEM. OVER 500 IN THE FIRST POT IS A GOOD SIGN. REAL GOOD. THAT WAS NICE. FIRST POT'S ALWAYS GOOD. THIS POT'S GOOD. WE'RE IN 'EM. AAH! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! Narrator: CALL IT SKILL OR CALL IT JUST PLAIN DUMB LUCK, BUT CAPTAIN SIG IS BACK ON THE CRAB. I WOULD -- I WOULD EAT THAT CRAB! THAT'S HOW NICE THEY ARE! Sig: I STILL NEED TO TOP OFF THE FIRST TWO TANKS THAT WE HAD FILLED, AND THEN WE'RE GOING INTO OUR THIRD TANK, AND SO THE BOAT'S GONNA GET REAL HEAVY AGAIN. AND WITH THE AMOUNT OF ICE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING, YOU KNOW, IT JUST MAKES THINGS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT. [ GRUNTS ] Narrator: AS THE POT COMES UP, EDGAR SPOTS A WEAKNESS IN THE LINE. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT! Sig:  DAMN IT! DAMN IT! I JUST SAID IT, TOO -- "WE'RE GONNA LOSE THAT [BLEEP] POT." Narrator: TO SAVE THE POT AND PREVENT ANY POSSIBLE INJURY TO THE CREW... WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT! ...EDGAR QUICKLY GRABS THE SLACK IN THE LINE AND TOSSES IT OVERBOARD, LEAVING HIM JUST SECONDS TO THROW THE TAIL END INTO THE BLOCK. I HEARD "WATCH OUT," AND I RAN. I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE AIR. DID YOU SEE ME JUMP?! WHOO-HOO-HOO! BRIDLE SNAPPED? YEP! WELL, NO WONDER. WE GOT TOO MUCH CRAB IN THE POT. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] THERE WAS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THAT BRIDLE HOLDING THE POT. SO WE GOT TO HOOK THE HOOK UP INSIDE THE POT. IF HE CAN HOOK THE HOOK  IN THE CROSSBAR, THEN THE POT WILL COME UP STRAIGHT. AND I CAN'T REALLY TURN THE BOAT SUPER-HARD WHEN THAT HAPPENS 'CAUSE I JUST ADD MORE DRAG. I DON'T WANT TO SNAP THE OTHER SIDE OF IT, LOSING THE POT. OH, THEY GOT IT. [ LAUGHS ] I THOUGHT IT WAS COMING ON BOARD. I CALLED IT, TOO! I KNEW IT! Narrator: COMING UP... IT'S JUDGMENT DAY ON THE NORTH AMERICAN. I KIND OF TALKED IT OVER WITH THE GUYS, AND, UH... AND LATER... I WILL NOT BE SHAKING THIS ONE! ...A GREENHORN CAN'T CATCH A BREAK. CLEAN IT OUT! I'M GONNA STACK IT OUT! Narrator: 250 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE 113-FOOT TIME BANDIT PLOWS THROUGH 30-FOOT SEAS. WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT,  WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT, RUN! YEP, THAT'S WHAT I'M [BLEEP] TALKING ABOUT. I JUST CALLED A VERY BIG WAVE THAT HIT THIS BOAT. YEAH, THAT WOULD HAVE HURT SOMEONE REALLY, REALLY BAD. Narrator: AFTER A NIGHT PULLING 15,000 POUNDS OF FEMALES AND JUVENILES... WE GOT TO GET ON OUT OF HERE. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN ANDY MOVED ALL 110 OF HIS POTS ONTO NEW, UNTESTED GROUNDS. Andy: THE BOYS KNOW THEY HAVE TWO DAYS OF JUST NOT SLEEPING. WE'RE GONNA SLAM 100,000 POUNDS ON THEM HERE, JAM TO TOWN, COME BACK, STACK ALL THE GEAR ON, AND GO HOME, CALL OUR SEASON. JUST SHOW ME THE WAY HOME, MAN. Narrator: NOW, COME HELL OR HIGH WATER, CAPTAIN ANDY PLANS TO GRIND HIS CREW UNTIL THE BOAT IS PLUGGED. OH, YEAH! [ CHUCKLES ] LOOKS ALL RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL KEEPERS IN THERE. COME ON, BABY! ABOUT 400, MAYBE. I CAN'T WAIT TO NOT SORT ANOTHER CRAB. MY CHEEKS ARE FROZEN. 320! 320. Narrator: THE FIRST POT SHOWS DECENT NUMBERS... KIND OF GETTING TIRED OF IT. OH, WELL. JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER, I GUESS. ...BUT DECENT WON'T MAKE THE DEADLINE. WE KIND OF HAVE A BIG WAVE, SO WATCH OUT. OH, IT'S OUT OF THE BLOCK! GET IT OFF YOUR HEAD! WHOA! WHOO! THAT WAS SERIOUS [BLEEP] THAT'S BAD. THAT WAS SCARY. THAT WAS [BLEEP] SCARY. SEE THAT? LOOK AT THAT. NERVES OF STEEL. Narrator: SHEA REACTS QUICKLY AND TOSSES THE 2-INCH LINE OFF HIS NECK. WE WERE INCHES OR SECONDS AWAY FROM COMPLETE DISASTER, WHO KNOWS HOW CLOSE IT WAS. THE WAVE WENT DOWN, LIKE, PROBABLY 20 FEET. IT PULLED ON THE POT SO TIGHT, IT BLEW IT OUT OF THE BLOCK RIGHT THERE, THREW IT 7 FEET ABOVE SHEA'S HEAD. Scott: I WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT THERE TO HELP HIM, BUT I WAS TRYING TO FIX THIS FRICKING KNOT FOR HIM. Long: IT'S LIKE SCOTTY WANTS MORE MONEY, SO HE'S LIKE, "WELL, IF WE LOSE A GUY, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER PERCENTAGE." DEFINITELY WAS NOT TRYING TO HURT SHEA. [ LAUGHS ] YOU CAN'T HURT STEEL, MAN. LUCKILY, SHEA IS ON TOP OF HIS GAME AND THREW IT BACK IN THE BLOCK BEFORE HE GOT SNAPPED IN HALF. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO CHANGE MY SHORTS. I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND. Narrator: WITH ANOTHER DISASTER NARROWLY AVERTED, THE TIME BANDIT HAS JUST 36 HOURS TO CATCH AND DELIVER ANOTHER 190,000 POUNDS OF OPILIO CRAB. BACK IN DUTCH, 280 MILES FROM THE FISHING GROUNDS, AFTER A 30-HOUR STEAM, THE NORTH AMERICAN FINALLY ROUNDS PRIEST ROCK. THAT'LL BE IT FOR OPILIO 2008. DONE. Narrator: FOR THE CREW, THE RETURN TO PORT MARKS THE END OF A LONG, GRUELING SEASON. AND WITHOUT THE DISTRACTIONS OF THE BERING SEA, DECKHAND DAVIN NES NOW FACES LIFE WITHOUT HIS BROTHER. I FEEL LIKE HE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A PART OF ME, 'CAUSE JEFF AND I WERE -- WE WERE TIGHT. WE WERE REALLY CLOSE. Narrator: DAVIN LOST HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, JEFF, AFTER HE FELL FROM A STACK OF POTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON. Nes: YOU KNOW, STEN AND THE BOYS DEDICATED THIS SEASON TO MY BROTHER, JEFF, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A REALLY SPECIAL THING. IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS I'VE EVER HAD TO GO THROUGH. AND I DON'T THINK I'LL STILL GET OVER IT. I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER GET OVER IT. I MISS THAT GUY DEARLY. DAVIN'S BEEN NOTHING BUT A SOLID FOUNDATION ON THIS BOAT. JEFF WOULD BE VERY PROUD OF HIM. BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN NOW, HE'S BEEN LOOKING OVER US AND AFTER US. THIS SEASON'S FOR YOU. Narrator: AS THE PROCESSOR BEGINS HAULING OFF THE 115,000 POUNDS OF OPIES, DOWN IN THE GALLEY, THE SKIPPER CALLS A MEETING TO DECIDE THE GREENHORN'S FATE. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] A GREAT GUY TO BE AROUND, BUT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WORLD. HE DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A CRAB FISHERMAN. IF THE CHIPS CAME DOWN AND THINGS GOT TOUGH, AS WE KNOW THEY CAN, HE'S NOT THE MAN I WANT ON DECK. I VOTE NO. Narrator: THE GREENHORN'S FUTURE NOW LIES IN THE SKIPPER'S HANDS. THIS ISN'T CUT OUT FOR EVERYBODY, THIS KIND OF WORK. I'VE KIND OF TALKED IT OVER WITH THE GUYS, AND YOU WON'T BE RETURNING FOR REDS. OKAY. BUT TAKE THIS EXPERIENCE AND LEARN FROM IT AND APPLY IT TO WHATEVER YOU DO IN YOUR LIFE. YOU FISHED IN THE BERING SEA. EXACTLY. AND THAT'S WHY YOU GOT THE SWEATSHIRT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY. RIGHT ON, MAN. THAT'S ALL I WANTED, TOO. I WANTED TO DO THIS. MY BROTHER DID IT. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT FOR ME. AND THERE WAS TIMES IT WAS TOUGH AS HELL, YOU KNOW? BUT THE CAPTAIN IS RIGHT, YOU KNOW, ABOUT NOT WANTING ME TO COME BACK FOR REDS. IT'S AN AWESOME FEELING KNOWING THAT I CRABBED WITH THE BEST. AND NOBODY CAN TAKE THAT AWAY. MAN, THAT'S AWESOME. Narrator: COMING UP, A WINTER WIZARD FREEZE. THE CLOCK'S TICKING, THE SPRAY'S FREEZING, THE ICE IS CHARGING. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE WORST PART OF OUR JOB RIGHT HERE. Narrator: 210 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR. DURING LAST NIGHT'S STORM, FREEZING SPRAY COATED THE 155-FOOT WIZARD WITH NEARLY 6 TONS OF ICE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE WORST PART OF OUR JOB RIGHT HERE, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. EVERY TIME WE MAKE THAT RUN BACK UP THE HILL, WE PUT A BUNCH OF ICE ON THE BOAT, AND THE ICE HAS TO COME OFF ON THE WAY DOWN. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN GO BACK, LOAD THE BOAT, HEAD TO ST. PAUL, AND CALL THIS TRIP DONE. IT'S [BLEEP] UP. YOU GOT TO DO IT, THOUGH, MAN. Narrator: IT'S BEEN NEARLY FOUR MONTHS OF PURE TORTURE FOR THE BROKEN CREW. EVERYONE IS MISERABLE. THAT IS, EVERYONE BUT THE NEW HORN. YES, IT'S QUITE FUN. AND HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ANY BETTER. THIS FRESH AIR AND -- HIS DEFINITION OF FUN IS NOT ANYTHING CLOSE TO MY DEFINITION OF FUN. ABOUT THE GOOFIEST [BLEEP] IN THE BERING SEA RIGHT NOW. DRUGS, SEX, AND ROCK 'N' ROLL IS MY DEFINITION OF FUN, AND THIS GUY LIKES BEATING ICE AND CALLS THAT FUN. I'D RATHER BE [BLEEP] Colburn: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE, BUT I THINK THIS BATTLE MAY BE GETTING CLOSE TO A CLOSE BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE TANKS ARE GETTING AWFULLY CLOSE RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT TO BE REAL CLOSE TO FILLING THIS BOAT. Narrator: AS KEITH APPROACHES THE NEXT STRING, THE MEN CAN FINALLY GET BACK TO BUSINESS. LET'S GO CRABBING, BOYS! WHOO! THERE'S MONEY! THERE'S MONEY! HERE'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT! THEY CAN FEEL IT. THEY KNOW IT. THEY KNOW WE'RE THERE, MAN. THEY KNOW WE'RE LIKE RIGHT, RIGHT ON IT. YEAH! WHOO! I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH THE CLOCK'S TICKING, THE SPRAY'S FREEZING, THE ICE IS CHARGING, YOU KNOW, THE GUYS ARE CHIPPING AND STACKING, BUT THE WIZARD'S ROCKIN'. THIS IS A LOT BETTER. WHOO! JUST CAPPED OFF THE STARBOARD AFT AND ABOUT TO CAP OFF THE STARBOARD FORWARD TANKS. THREE OF THE WIZARD'S FOUR 30,000-GALLON TANKS ARE TOPPED OFF. HEY, SOPER, STAND BY. I'M COMING OUT AGAIN. OH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS THREE RIBS. IT'S NOT THREE RIBS. THREE RUNGS, I MEANT. OH, THREE RUNGS ON THE LADDER. OH, WE'LL GET HER IN NO TIME FLAT. GOOD JOB, GUYS. GOOD JOB. RIGHT ON, MAN. OHH! HEY! DON'T TOUCH THE CAPTAIN! [ LAUGHS ] ONE MORE HIGH FIVE. HERE WE GO, LYNN. RIGHT ON, GUYS. RIGHT ON. MAN DOWN! MAN DOWN! PUT THE WHAMMY TO THE PORT AFT, OKAY? ALMOST THERE. Colburn: THESE LAST 50 OR 60 POTS, THAT SHOULD DO IT. WE'RE THAT CLOSE TO BEING FULL. 4-4-0. Narrator: THE CREW HAS STUFFED THE LAST 10 POTS IN THE PORT AFT TANKS. BUT FOR SOME REASON, THE HOLDS WON'T FILL UP. LITTLE DISAPPOINTING. WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE HAD THEM FILLED BY NOW. BUT WE'LL GET THERE. UH-OH. I CAN'T EVER REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THESE TANKS WOULD JUST KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING LIKE THIS. I KNOW THESE GUYS HAVE GOT TO BE GETTING FRUSTRATED, TOO. I MEAN, THE TANKS HAVE BEEN LIKE THAT FAR FROM THE TOP FOREVER. Narrator: 115 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, THE TIME BANDIT CREW CONTINUES THEIR FOUR-DAY POT-PULLING MARATHON. ECHO IN HIS HEAD. WITH DECENT NUMBERS CLEARING THE RAIL, CAPTAIN ANDY IS SHOWING NO SIGNS OF STOPPING. WE'RE GONNA GO ALL NIGHT TILL WE'RE DONE. WE'RE NOT EVEN HALFWAY THERE, SO WE GOT A LONG WAYS TO GO. Neal: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AMOUNTS ARE. I'M JUST HAULING GEAR TILL THEY SAY, "LET'S GO IN." WANT TO GET THESE POTS ON BOARD SO I CAN GO TAKE A NAP. Narrator: ALTHOUGH THE CREW HAS SLAVED WITHOUT A BREAK FOR NEARLY 20 HOURS... IT'S NOT HARD TO MAKE CAPTAIN CRY. ...THEY CAN ALL LOOK FORWARD TO ANOTHER 48 HOURS BEFORE THEY CAN CALL IT A DAY. Neal: THE WEATHER RIGHT NOW IS BLOWING APPROXIMATELY 30 KNOTS OF WIND, AND THE TEMPERATURE AT THE MOMENT IS APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES. AS THE CREW GRINDS ON, SCOTTY BEGINS CALLING HIS OWN PERSONAL BREAKS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY POTS WE'VE PULLED -- 1, 2, 40. CAN'T KEEP TRACK. Narrator: THE HEIR APPARENT SWOOPS BACK IN... FLY IN, FLY OUT. ...JUST IN TIME TO HELP OUT WITH THE LAST FEW POTS. WHAT'S WRONG WITH FLYING IN AND FLYING OUT? I GUESS NOTHING IF YOU'RE THE GUY FLYING IN AND FLYING OUT. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT IS THE BEST JOB. ONE DAY, SHEA, YOU'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO THAT YOURSELF. THAT'S HOW CAPTAINS' SONS GET TO DO IT. I DON'T KNOW, NOT LIKE THE REST OF US, HAVE TO PROVE OURSELVES, GET HIRED, POSSIBILITY OF GETTING FIRED. WORK MY ASS OFF. YOU KNOW, SHEA, IF YOU WEREN'T SO TALL, YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T FALL DOWN SO MANY TIMES. SON OF A [BLEEP] HILLSTRAND OR NO HILLSTRAND, THERE'S NOT MUCH SYMPATHY UP IN THE WHEELHOUSE. I'M JUST AS TIRED AS THEY ARE. THEY AREN'T BITCHING. Narrator: THE CORNELIA MARIE AND THE EARLY DAWN ARE GAINING ON THE WIZARD'S NUMBERS. Narrator: 240 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, ABOARD THE WIZARD, LOUSY WEATHER PLUS MEDIOCRE FISHING ARE ADDING UP TO ONE GRUMPY DECK BOSS... I WILL NOT BE SHAKING THIS. CLEAN IT OUT. I'M GONNA STACK IT OUT. ...AND ONE MISERABLE GREENHORN. I WILL NOT BE SHAKING THIS ONE! PULL THE HOOK DOWN, CLEAN IT OUT, STACK IT OUT. IT'S [BLEEP] RIGHT HERE. I WILL NOT BE SHAKING THIS ONE! PULL THE HOOK DOWN, CLEAN IT OUT, I'M GONNA STACK IT OUT! [BLEEP] WELL, I HEARD HIM SAY IT [BLEEP] FIVE TIMES. [BLEEP] HE'S FREAKING OUT. THAT'S NOT HOW LYNNY DOES IT! THAT'S HOW LYNNY'S SISTER DOES IT! LYNN, GO GET ME A SMOKE! THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. I GOT SOPER BREATHING DOWN MY NECK EVERY [BLEEP] LITTLE MISTAKE I MAKE, AND HE'S YELLING AT ME. I'VE BEEN GETTING ON LYNN BECAUSE HE JUST IS, LIKE, PERMANENTLY STONED. HE CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. I GOT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME, IT SEEMS LIKE. Narrator: ANOTHER BRUTAL OPILIO SEASON IS COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE FOR THE WIZARD, IF KEITH'S CREW CAN KEEP FROM KILLING EACH OTHER. WHOA, WHOA. WE JUST FILLED THREE OF THE FOUR TANKS, AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS TOP OFF THE FOURTH ONE, AND WE'RE DONE. BEYOND BEING BEHIND SCHEDULE, LOSING TIME, CRAB SUCKS, AND THE BOAT'S TAKING A BUNCH OF ICE, UH...IT'S NOT A BAD DAY. Narrator: KEITH NEEDS HIS CREW TO HOLD ON LONG ENOUGH TO TOP OFF ONE MORE TANK. BUT RIGHT NOW, THAT TANK IS A BOTTOMLESS PIT. Colburn: I'M GETTING FRUSTRATED. I THOUGHT LAST STRING, FOR SURE, WE WERE GONNA CHOKE OFF THAT PORT FORWARD TANK. Narrator: ON THE DECK OF A CRAB BOAT, FOUL MOODS BLOW IN WITH FOUL WEATHER. AND EVEN BETWEEN GREENHORNS, CRAB ROLLS DOWNHILL. LYNN OFF-LOADS HIS FRUSTRATION ON THE NEW HORN, COOPER WEATHERBY. I'M DOING MY JOB OUT HERE. I MEAN, I'M KILLING RIGHT NOW. THINGS ARE MOVING QUICK, EVERYTHING'S BEING DONE, EVERYTHING'S ON TASK. COOPER'S DOING PRETTY GOOD. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TOO SOON. I THINK LYNN IS KIND OF THINKING, "WOW, I BETTER STEP UP." ALL RIGHT, NOW HE'S NOT REALLY PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT I SAY. HE'S TRYING TO DO BASICALLY THE OPPOSITE, AND MAKE MY LIFE HELL RIGHT NOW. I'M KIND OF MISSING MOI RIGHT NOW. ME AND MOI, WE KIND OF COULD LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW -- WE KNEW WHAT WE HAD TO DO FOR BAIT. IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE GOT FIRED, AT LEAST FOR MY SAKE. BUT HE'S BEEN HERE LONGER THAN I HAVE, SO... WE'LL GO WITH HIS -- HIS SHOTS. Narrator: AFTER AN 18-HOUR OVERNIGHT GRIND, THE BOTTOMLESS LAST TANK STILL ISN'T TOPPED OFF. Colburn: YOU KNOW, THE NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED OFF A LITTLE BIT, AND THOSE TANKS ARE JUST REFUSING TO FILL UP. AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN, BUT IT BETTER HAPPEN AWFULLY SOON BECAUSE THE CLOCK'S TICKING. [ GROANS ] SLOWLY BUT SURELY STARTING TO LOSE THE BATTLE HERE. Narrator: THE FISHING HASN'T IMPROVED AND NEITHER HAS THE MOOD ON DECK. Soper: MAYBE A LITTLE ICE-BUSTING PARTY WILL RAISE EVERYBODY'S SPIRITS! I DON'T KNOW. I SEE A FULL RACK OF BAIT UP THERE. WAIT 30 POTS AND GET THAT SHOT LATER, OKAY? THEY ASK HIM TO DO SOMETHING, HE [BLEEP] DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE, YOU KNOW? I THINK HE KNOWS IT ALL, SO I'M NOT GONNA ASK HIM TO DO ANYTHING ANYMORE. GONNA LET HIM DO IT ON HIS OWN AND SEE IF HE DOES KNOW IT ALL. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I THINK PROBABLY JUST A BIT OF FRUSTRATION. EVERYBODY'S TIRED. IT'S COLD OUT. IT'S NOT VERY ENJOYABLE RIGHT NOW. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON, I'M TRYING TO GET HIM TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE BAIT SET UP AT THE TABLE, 'CAUSE I CAN WORK ON THE BAIT FASTER THAN HE CAN. HE DOESN'T -- [BLEEP] [BLEEP] ALL RIGHT. I'M RUNNING SOME [BLEEP] BAIT. YOU'RE IN THE WAY, OKAY? [BLEEP] IF HE PUSHES ME AGAIN [BLEEP] [BLEEP] GONNA HIT THE FAN. THE KIDS JUST HAD A LITTLE DUSTUP, AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TOO FRIENDLY WITH EACH OTHER RECENTLY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS. ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW, AND HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY WILL INFORM THEM OF THE FACT, THAT, YOU KNOW, IF FISTS START FLYING, BAGS START PACKING ON THIS BOAT. I DO NOT TOLERATE THAT. Narrator: SINCE OCTOBER'S KING CRAB SEASON... THE CRAB FLEET HAS ENDURED NEARLY EIGHT WEEKS OF PURE TORTURE. WHOA! MISERY IS PART OF THE JOB! THEY'VE TOILED THROUGH EPIC STORMS -- WITH MOTHER NATURE... AND EACH OTHER. FAMILY BONDS WERE PUT TO THE TEST. DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] ASK ANYBODY ANYTHING! NOW, AS DREAMS OF HOME AND FAMILY BECOME CLOSER TO A REALITY, CAPTAINS AND CREWS STOP AT NOTHING TO FIGHT THROUGH THE PAIN AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. BERING SEA DEMENTIA. EVERY CRAB FISHERMAN THAT'S A REAL CRAB FISHERMAN WILL EXPERIENCE IT QUITE OFTEN. GOT TO START FEELING A LITTLE... [ WHISTLES ] [ LAUGHS ] HY-Y-Y-Y-Y-AH! CAVEMAN CATCH CRAB!
