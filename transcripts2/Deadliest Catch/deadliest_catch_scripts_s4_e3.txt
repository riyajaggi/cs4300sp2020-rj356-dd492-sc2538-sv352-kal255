 KICK ASS! [ CHEERING CONTINUES ] OOH, YEAH. OOH, YEAH. THIS IS AWESOME. THAT'S A BIG DADDY. DIDN'T LOOK VERY GOOD YESTERDAY. TODAY WE'RE LOOKING GOOD. COME ON, BABY! LOOK AT THAT! THE RED ZONE RIGHT THERE! Narrator: AFTER A SLOW START TO THE SEASON, THE TIDE FINALLY TURNS IN THEIR FAVOR. THAT'S CRAB FISHING FOR YOU, MAN -- HEAVEN AND HELL. IT COULD BE HELL, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'LL FIND THE MOTHER LODE. WOW! [ LAUGHS ] THAT COWBOY HAT'S GOOD LUCK, MAN. PUTS THAT [BLEEP] COWBOY HAT ON, AND WHAMMO! WE'RE ON THE CRAB. EVERY TIME IT COMES ON, GAME ON! [ BOTH LAUGH ] Narrator: WITH FULL POTS AND SPIRITS RISING, GREENHORN SCOTT HILLSTRAND TAKES A SHOT AT WORKING THE RAIL. HE STARTED OUT A LITTLE BIT SLOW, BUT, MAN, HE'S JUST RACKING BUOYS RIGHT THROUGH THE BLOCK. [ WHIRRING ] I THINK SCOTT'S DOING GREAT. MAYBE HE'LL MAKE SOME GOOD MONEY, AND THEN HE'LL HAVE TIME OFF WHEN I HAVE TIME OFF AND WE CAN DO STUFF TOGETHER. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. I KNOW HE LOVES IT OUT HERE. YEAH, YOU JUST WANT TO DO THE BEST FOR HIM, AND YOU WANT HIM TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN YOU HAD. Narrator: SCOTTIE HILLSTRAND GREW UP LIKE ANY OTHER NORMAL KID, THAT IS IF THAT KID WERE THE SON OF A SECOND-GENERATION CRAB FISHERMAN. Scottie: YEAH, I FEEL LIKE THIS BOAT IS A PART OF ME. YOU KNOW, IT'S WHERE I GREW UP. YOU KNOW, FOR MY 2-, 3-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAYS, I WAS ON THE BOAT. MY FAMILY HAS NEVER BEEN THE 9:00-TO-5:00 DEAL, BUT THAT'S WHY I'M COMING OUT HERE. THIS IS MY TRIAL PERIOD, YOU KNOW? SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Narrator: SCOTTIE JOINS A FISHING HERITAGE BEGINNING IN 1964 WITH HIS GRANDFATHER JOHN WESLEY HILLSTRAND. Scottie: MY GRANDFATHER STARTED FISHING, YOU KNOW, IN THE '70s, AND HE KICKED ASS. MY GRANDPA WAS A CRAZY GUY. HE WAS ONE HELL OF A FISHERMAN, TOO. ROUGH AND TOUGH -- THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS. Narrator: A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE GRANDPA HILLSTRAND FISHED THESE WATERS. BUT SOME THINGS HAVE REMAINED THE SAME -- THE BERING SEA IS JUST AS DEADLY, AND THE HILLSTRAND CLAN? WELL, THEY'RE JUST AS WILD AS EVER. ♪ I AM, I AM, I AM ♪ ♪ A CHANGING MAN ♪ WHOA! ♪ I'LL HOLD HER, BOY ♪ ♪ JUST AS LONG AS I CAN ♪ ♪ BUT I AM, I KNOW, I AM ♪ ♪ A CHANGING MAN ♪ ♪ GOT THIS NEED TO BE FORGIVEN ♪ ♪ AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS I'VE DONE ♪ I HOOKED IT A LITTLE BIT TO THE LEFT, WHICH CAUSED ME TO GO THROUGH THE BUNKER.

NOW THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE OF POTS SHY OF CRAMMING THEIR CRAB TANK WITH THE 33,000 POUNDS THEY NEEDED FOR THIS TRIP. 60, 69! 7-5, BABY! CRAB FISHING NOW, BABY! Narrator: AFTER 19 DAYS OF FISHING, THE TIME BANDIT WILL BE THE FIRST BOAT TO HEAD BACK TO DUTCH HARBOR AND THE FIRST TO GET PAID. [ LAUGHS ] ALL ABOUT THE MONEY! SHAKE 'N' BAKE, LITTLE BROTHER! SHAKE 'N' BAKE! [ CHEERING ] IT'S A 26-HOUR RUN TO DUTCH HARBOR, WHERE THE TIME BANDIT WILL OFF-LOAD. [ SONAR PINGS ] 55 MILES TO THE SOUTH, THERE'S THE 126-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. WE'RE GONNA GET 35, 40 HOURS OUT OF THIS, YOU WATCH. YEAH! Narrator: CAPTAIN SIG STUCK WITH HIS GUT AND HAS DROPPED MORE GEAR ON HIS DAD'S GROUNDS. NOW THE FAMILY ROAD MAP IS PAYING OFF. I MEAN, RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT CRAB OFF TO THE EAST HERE. I'VE GOT CRAB OUT TO THE WEST. I'VE GOT IT IN BOTH SETS. I JUST, YOU KNOW, AM SCRATCHING MY HEAD, THINKING, "YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO PICK A SPOT." WE'RE GONNA KEEP STACKING, SEE HOW THESE STRINGS DO, AND MAKE UP OUR MINDS. BUT WHEN I SEE A TABLE FULL OF CRAB, I SURE IN THE HECK DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE IT. Narrator: ON DECK, GREENHORN JAKE ANDERSON IS IN CHARGE OF THE CRAB COUNT. Sig: HOW MANY? 24. 2-4. HIS JOB IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE COUNT FROM THE OTHER FISHERMEN, WRITE THE NUMBER DOWN, AND RELAY IT TO SIG. 23. 15, 1-5. 27, 2-7! JAKE, GET ME THOSE NUMBERS,  OKAY? ROGER, ROGER! SIG'S BEGINNING TO SUSPECT THE COUNT IS NOT ACCURATE. OKAY. AND THEN BEFORE THAT. 41. YOU HAVE 32, YOU JUST TOLD ME. AND 11 MAKES -- 31. SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN -- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING? I WANT THE CRAB COUNT, AND I WANT IT SET! AND I WANT IT NOW! 53, 5-3, 44, 4-4, AND 42, 4-2. [ CHUCKLES ] Man: WHAT HAPPENS IF THOSE NUMBERS ARE WRONG? Edgar: IF YOUR COUNTS ARE OFF, YOUR WEIGHT'S OFF. IF YOUR WEIGHT'S OFF AND YOU CATCH TOO MUCH, YOU CAN GET FINED. NUMBERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. MY LIFE CONSISTS OF NUMBERS, AND WHEN I DON'T GET 'EM, I GET REALLY FREAKING MAD, BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO GIVE ME NUMBERS. Narrator: AFTER 36 STRAIGHT HOURS OF WORK, DECK BOSS EDGAR NEEDS TO REGAIN CONTROL OF A SLOPPY DECK OR THE NEXT ASS BEING CHEWED WILL BE HIS OWN. HE DOESN'T HAVE A KNIFE. HE DOESN'T HAVE -- HE DOESN'T HAVE A KNIFE. HE DOESN'T HAVE A KNIFE. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GOT A KNIFE. HERE. THERE'S 20 KNIFE BELTS. NO REASON ALL OF YOU GUYS SHOULDN'T HAVE A KNIFE ON YOU. IF I GO OVER, I WANT SOMEONE TO BE THERE FOR ME. Narrator: IF A FISHERMAN GETS CAUGHT IN THE LINE -- SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY -- A SHARP KNIFE MAY BE THE ONLY THING THAT STANDS BETWEEN STAYING ON DECK OR A TRIP TO THE BOTTOM. THERE, A LITTLE REMINDER, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE WEARING A BELT. TODAY, JAKE WILL WEAR A SMELLY COD INSTEAD OF A KNIFE. I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO FORGET. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE COULD HAVE. SCREW THE BOOTS. SCREW THE GLOVES. ALWAYS WEAR YOUR KNIFE BELT. ALWAYS. VERY HUMBLING. AS IF THE JOB'S NOT HARD ENOUGH ITSELF, YOU GET TO WEAR A COD. NEXT, A CAPTAIN TRIES TO CATCH A THIEF. TOUCH MY GEAR AGAIN, IT'S GAME ON, PAL. [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 270 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN OF THE WIZARD IS ON THE CRAB. Keith: WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START, AND THAT ONE'S GOT TO BE ALL OF 70 CRAB, 60 OR 70, SO THIS'LL WORK. OH, YEAH! [ CHEERING ] Man: THAT IS BEAUTIFUL! Narrator: KEITH CONSOLIDATED 300 POTS INTO ONE SQUARE MILE, A RISKY MOVE THAT'S NOW PAYING OFF IN SPADES. OH, BOY. I THINK SO! HERE WE GO. WHAT DID WE GET, LENNY? WE HAD 112 IN THE LAST POT. WHOO! 112. [ LAUGHS ] WE'RE OFF TO A WONDERFUL START. RIGHT ON! YEAH! WHOO! SO FAR, WE'VE HAD A 75, A 70, A 75, A 68, AND A 112 THROUGH THESE FIRST 5. OH, LOOK AT THAT! WHOO! YEAH! THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CRAB. AND HE'S NOT HAPPY. Narrator: ON DECK, THE TWO GREENHORNS, JASON MOILANEN AND LYNN GUITARD, HUSTLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE FAST-PACED ACTIVITY. I ENJOY BEING OUT HERE, YOU KNOW? SO FAR, AT LEAST RIGHT NOW. I DON'T MIND THE CRITICISM. YOU KNOW, IT'S MY OWN FAULT. LOOK OUT! WHERE'D HE GO? Narrator: AND LYNN IS STEADILY PROVING HIS WORTH. Soper: THE KID'S DOING QUITE A BIT BETTER THAN MOI RIGHT NOW. HE'S NOT SHOWING SIGNS OF BEING BEAT UP, AND HIS SKILLS ARE GETTING BETTER. HE'S GETTING A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED WITH WHAT HE'S DOING. THIS IS OLDER STUFF RIGHT HERE. NOPE. Narrator: HALFWAY THROUGH THE STRING, KEITH NOTICES A POT IS NOT WHERE HE PLACED IT. Keith: IT'S ABOUT 2/10 OF A MILE OFF WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE, WHICH IS AN INDICATION THAT SOMEBODY CAME THROUGH HERE AND DECIDED TO TAKE A PEEK AT ONE OF MY POTS. IT LOOKS LIKE HE CAME IN, WANDERED AROUND, PULLED A LOOP HERE. WHY WOULD YOU PULL A LOOP UNLESS YOU PULLED IN, HAULED THE POT, SET IT BACK, AND THEN TOOK OFF. IF HE'S CHECKING MY POTS, THEN I'M PISSED OFF, BECAUSE THE ONE THING I DON'T DO IS TOUCH OTHER PEOPLE'S GEAR, PERIOD. WE'RE PICKING THESE UP, AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE THEM UP THE HILL. THERE'S NO WAY I'M PUTTING THEM BACK IN HERE, ESPECIALLY WITH THIS GUY SITTING RIGHT THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. [ BIRDS CALLING ] Narrator: KEITH SPOTS ANOTHER CRAB BOAT OFF THE BOW. Keith: HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,  GUYS? IT'S THAT SAME GUY. HEY, BOAT RIGHT OFF MY STARBOARD SIDE, YOU PICK ME UP HERE? I CAN'T GET ANY CLOSER! COME ON, YOU ON THIS ONE? [ STATIC ] HE'S NOT COMING BACK BECAUSE -- HE KNOWS WHY HE'S NOT COMING BACK -- 'CAUSE HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT I KNOW -- THAT'S THAT HE [BLEEP] HAULED MY POT. ALL RIGHT,  SEE YOU IN TOWN. DON'T EXPECT ME TO BE BUYING ANY [BLEEP] BEERS IN THE FUTURE. TOUCH MY GEAR AGAIN, IT'S GAME ON, PAL. [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: BACK IN DUTCH HARBOR, AS A STORM FRONT MOVES IN, THE EARLY DAWN SCRAMBLES TO LEAVE PORT. MIKE, LET PAT GET HIS BOW LINES IN. I NEED A DOCK GUY! BOW LINE! CAPTAIN RICK FEHST GROSSED $2 MILLION FISHING BROWN CRABS, BUT IT'S PUT HIM TWO WEEKS BEHIND THE START OF THE MORE LUCRATIVE RED-KING-CRAB SEASON. CLEAR! Fehst: WE GOT 100 POTS ON BOARD RIGHT NOW. I CAN COVER 50 MILES -- A HALF-MILE APART. IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG STRETCH TO SPREAD OUT YOUR GEAR, BUT...IT COULD PAY OFF. WITHIN TWO DAYS, I COULD HAVE THE INFORMATION I'M LOOKING FOR WITHOUT ANYBODY'S HELP. ONCE I FIND THEM, IT'S, "START MAKING BAIT, BOYS." IT'S TIME TO SET. Narrator: AS RICK SETS A COURSE TOWARD UNTESTED TERRITORY, THE CREW MAKE THEIR OWN PREPARATIONS DOWN IN THE GALLEY. HEAVENLY FATHER, WE THANK YOU FOR LAST BROWN-CRAB SEASON. THERE WAS NO INJURIES, AND YOU LOOKED OVER OUR FAMILY AND LOVED ONES. WE ASKED THAT YOU PUT A HAND OF PROTECTION OVER THE BOAT SO THERE ARE NO INJURIES. WE ASK THIS TO BE A PROFITABLE SEASON FOR US. YOU KNOW WE WORK HARD, AND WE ASK THAT WE SEE SOME PROFITS FROM OUR HARD WORK. Man: AMEN. LET'S CATCH SOME RED CRAB, BOYS. BE SAFE. GUYS ARE SPIRITUAL ON A BOAT. THEY MAY NOT BE THE TRADITIONAL RELIGION, BUT THEY'RE STILL SPIRITUAL. I MEAN, YOU SEE SO MUCH NEAT STUFF OUT HERE, YOU KNOW, THAT IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING WE DO. Narrator: PRAYER'S OVER. FOR THE GREENHORNS, SHANE DAVIS AND BRYAN MEZICH, THE BOAT OWNER'S SON, IT'S RIGHT BACK TO THE GRUNGE WORK OF PREPARING BAIT. [ MOTOR WHIRRING ] Mezich: WE NEED 100, BUT THE SKIPPER SAID WE COULD MAKE ABOUT 50, CALL IT GOOD, 'CAUSE THERE'LL BE TIME IN BETWEEN. WE CAN MAKE THEM THEN, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WE'RE MAKING. WE'RE GOING TILL, I GUESS, WE FEEL LIKE STOPPING. Fehst: TRY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE MINUTES THAT I HAVE WHILE I GOT THE WEATHER. I'VE GOT TILL MAYBE NOON TOMORROW. Narrator: BY NIGHTFALL, THE CLEAR-WEATHER WINDOW CLOSES. THE EARLY DAWN PLOWS THROUGH 20-FOOT SEAS AND 60-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS. NOW THEY NEED TO LAUNCH 80,000 POUNDS OF CRAB POTS IN ORDER TO STABILIZE THEIR BOAT. AH, HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN. [ BUZZER SOUNDS ] NUMBER ONE, GOING OVER, BABY! WHOO! THERE GOES THE FIRST POT OF THE 2007 RED CRAB SEASON. BRAVO, PAPA. GO GET SOME CRAB, PAPA. COME ON. STEP UP. GRAB SOME STEEL. GIVE HER A SPIN. TO GET THEIR 100 POTS OFF THE DECK, THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT IN UGLY CONDITIONS -- NOT AN EASY WAY TO START THE SEASON. COMING UP, A GREENHORN TAKES A HIT. YOU GET INTO THIS KIND OF WEATHER, THIS IS WHEN YOU START HAVING GUYS, YOU KNOW, GET IN TROUBLE. HEY! Narrator: 180 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, DAWN BREAKS ON THE CORNELIA MARIE. TWO WEEKS OF DISMAL FISHING HAS CAPTAIN PHIL'S BLOOD BOILING. Phil: THESE POTS HAVEN'T SHOWN ANYTHING. IT'S REALLY BAD. WE PROBABLY GOT AN 8, 9 AVERAGE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. THIS MORNING, FOR SOME REASON, I DON'T -- I FEEL LIKE I COULDN'T MAKE A DECISION TO WIPE MY [BLEEP] OR GO BLIND. AND THAT'S BAD. TO ME RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE I'M [BLEEP] UP. Narrator: TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE FEW CRAB THAT CLIMB INTO THE POTS ARE CLIMBING BACK OUT. Phil: HALF THE POTS THAT COME UP, THEIR DOORS AREN'T TIGHT ON THEM, YOU KNOW? JUST SLOPPY, JUST SLOPPY WORK, AND IT PISSES ME OFF. AND I THINK IT'S DING AND DONG THAT ARE DOING IT. Narrator: IN CRAB FISHING, ATTENTION TO DETAIL MATTERS, AND PHIL'S SONS JAKE AND JOSH ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. YOU GUYS SEE THE DOORS ON THESE POTS? THEY'RE HANGING OPEN ON THE BOTTOM? I DON'T KNOW WHO'S TYING THEM, BUT YOU GUYS NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB, MAN. I MEAN, THAT'S...  THAT'S NOT GOOD. THEY GET GOING IN A HURRY, AND THEY DON'T REALIZE THEY'RE DOING IT. BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLOW THEIR LITTLE ASS DOWN TO... DO IT RIGHT. I'D RATHER BE QUICK THEN TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER ON THE POT. IT'S HARD ENOUGH CATCHING THESE THINGS WITHOUT THROWING SLOPPY AND CARELESS IN THERE. Narrator: ALTHOUGH PHIL'S A STICKLER FOR EVEN THE SMALLEST DETAIL, HE TAKES IT EASY ON HIS SONS THIS TIME. AFTER ALL, JAKE HAS A BIRTHDAY COMING UP. TODAY'S HIS BIRTHDAY. I HAVEN'T SAID, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY." I GOT TO GIVE HIM A CARD HERE IN A LITTLE BIT. I WAS PARTYING MY ASS OFF WHEN HE WAS BORN. Man: YEAH? I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. ONLY BECAUSE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY, BIG BOY, AM I LIGHTENING UP ON YOU. BY THE WAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I'M STILL 21! Josh: IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY TOMORROW! IT'S THE 20th, ISN'T IT? THE 21st? THE 21st! OKAY, YEAH,  HE WAS BORN AT NIGHT, SO THERE'S A BIG DEAL ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS  THE 20th OR 21st. HIS DAD'S NOT SURE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE WAS BORN AT NIGHT. FOR SOME REASON, THAT GIVES IT A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. LAST YEAR, HE WENT AND HE BOUGHT EVERYBODY A BEER AT THE BAR, AND HE SAID THAT THAT WAS MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT. SO THIS YEAR, HE BETTER BE, LIKE, GIVING ME SOMETHING COOL. Phil: I CLAIM IT WAS THE 20th. I PICKED HIM UP TO SEE HOW CUTE HE WAS, AND HE PISSED ALL OVER ME. Narrator: ON A SHORT BREAK, THE SKIPPER REFUELS WITH CAFFEINE, NICOTINE, AND STRESS -- THE ESSENTIAL BERING SEA FOOD GROUPS. 12, 14... 16 LEFT OUT OF 36, SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT 20 -- HE'S BEEN THROUGH 56 RED BULLS IN 5 DAYS. DO THE MATH. ONE THING I LEARNED LAST SEASON -- DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS, JUST GET HIM WHAT HE WANTS. [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 150 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST, THE WIZARD CONTINUES ITS 24/7 OPERATION. WHILE KEITH GETS A REST, BROTHER MONTE TAKES THE WHEEL. YOU GET INTO THIS KIND OF WEATHER, THIS IS WHEN YOU START HAVING GUYS, YOU KNOW, GET IN TROUBLE. WEATHER GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING TONIGHT. WE'VE HAULED ABOUT 40, AND IT JUST RAISES THE BAR JUST ANOTHER NOTCH. JUST GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE HORN. Monte: IT'S BLOWING. IT'S STARTING TO BLOW. ALL RIGHT, INTO THE DITCH NOW. Narrator: IN LOUSY WEATHER, NO PLACE ON DECK IS SAFE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE GREENHORNS. Monte: WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THESE GREENHORNS EVEN WHEN IT'S NICE OUT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE DANGER ZONES ARE. LEARNING THESE THINGS TAKES TIME. UNFORTUNATELY, TIME IS ONE THING THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A SURPLUS OF. THROW ME THAT THROTTLE, MOI. RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU. MOI IS 35 YEARS OLD. AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT AGE IS AN ISSUE OUT HERE. THIS IS A YOUNG MAN'S GAME WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON ONE OF THESE DECKS. IT REALLY IS. HEADS UP! HEADS UP! HERE WE GO! HEAD ON OVER! [ MOTOR GRINDING ] LOOK OUT! HEADS UP! HEY! WHOA! Narrator: THE WRONG PLACE, AND THE WRONG TIME. MOI GOT LUCKY. JUST GOT WIPED OUT BY A WAVE SETTING THE HOOK ON THE POT. COMING AT YOU, BUD! Narrator: THE TWO-WEEK GRIND HAS LEFT MOI'S BODY BRUISED AND HIS SPIRT SHATTERED, AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. IN ALL HONESTY, I THINK HE'S IN FOR A LITTLE BIT OF AN EYE-OPENER, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... HEY, PHIL, CAN YOU HEAR ME? PHIL? [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 180 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE DRIVES INTO 20-FOOT SEAS AND 50-KNOT WINDS. THE TIDE'S GONNA CHANGE, AND IT'S GONNA GET REALLY NAUTICAL HERE SHORTLY IN THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS. Phil: I USED TO SIT AROUND AND LISTEN TO THE WEATHER, GET ALL WORRIED ABOUT IT AND EVERYTHING. I GAVE ALL THAT UP. WE'RE GONNA BE HERE. WE GOT A JOB TO DO. LET'S GO DO IT. SCREW THE WEATHER. Narrator: IT'S NOT THE WEATHER THAT WORRIES CAPTAIN PHIL. IT'S THE 14 DAYS OF HORRIBLE FISHING. BUT PHIL TRUDGES ON. AAH! ALL 100 POTS MUST BE STACKED IN ORDER TO MOVE TO BETTER GROUNDS. WELL, WE'RE DRAWING A LOT OF BLANKS OR POTS THAT HAVE LIKE 3 OR 4 CRAB IN THEM RIGHT NOW. WE'LL RUN A LITTLE WAYS, DUMP SOME MORE GEAR, THEN A LITTLE FARTHER, HAUL SOME MORE GEAR, MAYBE SLEEP SOMETIME. Narrator: BUT FOR THE SKIPPER, IT'S NO REST FOR THE WICKED. AFTER STAYING UP FOR 3 DAYS AND SPENDING THE LAST 19 HOURS IN THE CHAIR, THE CAFFEINE AND NICOTINE HAS STOPPED WORKING. NOW, WITH STRESS CULMINATING FROM DAYS OF BAD FISHING, AN UNHEALTHY DIET, AND SPORADIC FEVERS, THE SKIPPER BEGINS NODDING OFF AT THE WHEEL. SPEEDING OFF COURSE, CAPTAIN PHIL MISSES THE FIRST SET OF BUOY BAGS BY NEARLY 100 FEET. I DON'T KNOW WHAT POPS IS UP TO. WE'RE JUST KIND OF STANDING BY, NOT SURE WHAT'S GONNA GO ON. YOU DON'T WANT TO BUG PHIL OR ANYTHING. Narrator: MINUTES LATER, THE NEXT SET ARE ON THE BOW. BUT THEY'RE TOO CLOSE. [ BIRDS CALLING ] Man: HE DROVE BETWEEN THE DIVER AND THE TRAILER BUOY. AND YOU CAN'T PULL IT UP. YOU JUST GOT TO LET IT GO AND LET HIM BACK DOWN ON IT. USUALLY, THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SLEEP, SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] Narrator: NOW MURRAY INSISTS ON BUGGING PHIL. [ RINGING CONTINUES ] HELLO? HEY, PHIL, CAN YOU HEAR ME? [ LAUGHS ] Murray: WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAY AWAKE BECAUSE YOU HAVE, BASICALLY, SEVEN PEOPLE ON THIS VESSEL THAT ARE DEPENDING ON YOU. I MEAN, IT DOES HAPPEN. JUST [BLEEP] HAPPENS. [ LAUGHS ] [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 150 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST, CAPTAIN RICK FEHST OF THE EARLY DAWN, TWO WEEKS LATE IN THE GAME, SET A 100-POT, 50-MILE PROSPECT STRING IN UNTESTED WATERS. NOW, IN THE WAKE OF THE STORM, THE SKIPPER'S SPREAD THIN AND TRYING TO PLAY CATCH-UP. ANTICIPATION IS KILLING ME RIGHT NOW. Mezich: ONE BAIRDI, TWO HALIBUT, TWO COD, AND A WHATEVER -- SPIKY, ANNOYING FISH. [ BLUES MUSIC PLAYS ] COME ON, CRAB. WHERE ARE YOU? Narrator: THE SECOND TEST POT BRINGS NOTHING BUT MORE BAIT. THREE CODFISH, ONE STARFISH... AND A LITTLE HALIBUT. Quinn: CAN YOU SAY, "SEAFOOD SALAD"? TWO KEEPERS! OHH! 5! 12 CRAB FROM 10 POTS. THAT'S A CRAB AND A LEG AVERAGE. WE NEED TO HEAD FURTHER TO THE EAST 10 MILES. WE NEED TO HEAD FURTHER SOMEWHERE. Narrator: RICK'S FIRST DAY OF FISHING HAS BEEN A DISASTER. Fehst: I GOT ABOUT 60 POUNDS OF CRAB ON BOARD RIGHT NOW, AND I'VE GOT 327,940 POUNDS TO GO. Narrator: COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... HOW'S YOUR [BLEEP] SANDWICH? ...FOR THE NORWEGIAN SKIPPER, A MIDNIGHT SNACK IS HARD TO SWALLOW. Sig: HE'S SORTING CRAB WITH A FRICKIN' CHEESE SANDWICH. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THAT GUY? [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 250 MILES NORTH, THE TIME BANDIT HEADS TOWARDS DUTCH HARBOR FOR THEIR FIRST OFF-LOAD OF THE SEASON. AFTER TWO WEEKS OF HARD FISHING, THE CREW GETS TO ENJOY A RELAXED BREAKFAST... THE BERING SEA WILL BEAT YOU DOWN. WAKING UP THOUGH WITH GOOD OL' COFFEE. ...AND ANOTHER STAPLE OF CRABBING LIFE -- HANGING OUT WITH THE GUYS. THIS IS HOW WE MAKE A SANDWICH AROUND HERE -- TEAR IT UP... ...SMASH IT TOGETHER, AND THERE YOU GO. OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH. YEAH. Narrator: AS THE CREW RELAXES, SCOTTIE VOLUNTEERS FOR WHEEL WATCH AND GETS SOME RARE TIME FOR HIMSELF. THIS IS MY SON, SAWYER. MY WIFE. A PICTURE OF MY DAD AND SAWYER. IF I TAKE OVER THE BOAT, THEN CHANCES ARE HE'S GONNA END UP FOLLOWING JUST LIKE I DID, JUST LIKE MY DAD AND HIS BROTHERS DID, FOLLOWING IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS. LOOK, YOU KNOW, ANDY'S THE ONLY ONE THAT'S STILL MARRIED. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO... HAVE A SPLIT-UP FAMILY. THEN WHEN HE GETS OLD ENOUGH, HE'S GONNA WONDER -- YOU KNOW, THINK IT'S HIS FAULT WHY I WASN'T AROUND AND WHY I LEFT. I DON'T KNOW. THOSE ARE A LOT OF THE FEELINGS I HAD GROWING UP. YOU KNOW, IT SUCKS, BUT IT'S TRUE. IT WAS A CRAZY LIFE, THAT'S FOR SURE. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO DRAG THEM THROUGH IT OR NOT. IT'S ALL IN HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. YOU KNOW, IS THE GLASS HALF FULL, OR IS THE GLASS HALF EMPTY? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONE 8 MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR FOR 120 GRAND A YEAR, YOU KNOW? AND WHAT'S ALL THAT MONEY WORTH IF YOU CAN'T ENJOY IT WITH YOUR FAMILY? I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL SEE. IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT ME ANYMORE. THERE'S MY BOY. HE'S GONNA BE A HANDFUL. THAT'S FOR DANG SURE. MAYBE A FUTURE CRABBER. WE'LL SEE. [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 50 MILES TO THE SOUTH ON THE NORTHWESTERN, CAPTAIN SIG IS ON AVERAGE NUMBERS BUT SECOND-GUESSING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS SECOND SET OF 150 POTS. I'M VERY UNDECIDED ABOUT IF I SHOULD STICK AROUND HERE FOR TONIGHT OR THROW THESE ON DECK AND GO OUT WEST. I KNOW THERE'S BETTER NUMBERS OUT THERE. GREED, MAN. YOU WANT MORE. YOU WANT TO GET THEM WHILE YOU CAN GET THEM, WHILE THEY'RE HOT. I WANT TO GET THROUGH MY STRING QUICKLY, AND I WANT TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT ONE QUICKLY. [ WHIRRING ] [ GRINDING ] [ METAL CREAKING ] Narrator: JUST AS THE POT CLEARS THE WATER, THE PICKING HOOK'S PULLEY SCREECHES TO A HALT. THE SNATCH BLOCK ON THE PICKING HOOK JUST TOOK A...ON US. THERE'S A GROOVE WHEEL IN THAT SNATCH BLOCK UP THERE. THE CABLE PROBABLY ATE THROUGH IT. LUCKY IT DIDN'T GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH -- THE CABLE WOULD HAVE COME DOWN WITH THE POT AND EVERYTHING. Bradley: THIS IS OUR SPARE. WE TOOK THIS THING OFF A COUPLE YEARS AGO. I'M HOPING...THAT IT'S OKAY. Narrator: SINCE THE SPARE SNATCH BLOCK HAS A GOOD PULLEY IN IT, EDGAR PREPARES TO RIDE THE BOAT'S CRANE TO REMOVE THE BROKEN PART. HERE, PULL THIS UP. JUNIOR, PULL THIS LINE UP. Nick: CHANCE IS MOST LIKELY THAT YOU'RE GONNA FALL AND YOU'RE GONNA LAND ON THE DECK AND BREAK YOUR BACK. HEY, THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT. I DON'T FEEL LIKE FALLING 30 FEET... ONTO METAL OR WATER, EITHER ONE. ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER. LET'S GET UP THERE. HAVE A NICE TRIP. EDGAR IS HOISTED THREE STORIES TO THE BROKEN BLOCK. [ SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] Sig: THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU NEVER KNOW. STUFF WEARS OUT, YOU KNOW? THINGS GET BEAT UP ON THESE BOATS. CLEAR THE A-FRAME WITH THAT HOOK! Narrator: CRAB BOATS USE TWO SYSTEMS TO MANAGE GEAR -- WHILE THE FIXED PICKING BOOM HAULS POTS ABOARD, THE CRANE MOVES AND STACKS THE EMPTY POTS. IF ONE CRANE IS DISABLED, WORK SLOWS TO A CRAWL. IT'S ALREADY TIED OFF! BRING ME DOWN! Edgar: THIS IS A GOOD USED ONE, NICE AND SMOOTH. AND THAT'S A BAD ONE. [ CHUCKLES ] IT DOESN'T EVEN TURN. Narrator: EDGAR MAKES ONE MORE TRIP TO REPLACE THE BLOCK, BUT IT'S NOW PAST MIDNIGHT, AND SIG'S LOST VALUABLE TIME HE COULD BE FISHING. WHEN YOU ARE IN SEARCH MODE, LIKE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, YOU GET SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND YOU'RE SECOND-GUESSING YOURSELF THE WHOLE TIME. AND A LOT OF TIMES, YOU MAY FIND HOT FISHING IN ONE SPOT AND ANOTHER, AND NOW YOU'RE DIVIDED. IT'S A PAIN IN THE [BLEEP] THE WHOLE THING. AFTER A TWO-HOUR DELAY, THE NORTHWESTERN IS BACK ON THE GRIND... ...ALL EXCEPT DECKHAND MATT BRADLEY. Sig: WHO'S ON THE HOOK, MAN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MATT DOES NOT LOOK ENTHUSED TO THROW THE HOOK, AND I'M JUST ABOUT TO KICK HIS [BLEEP] OFF OF THERE. THAT GUY GETS AN ATTITUDE, MAN. AT NIGHT, HE GETS TO BE A LITTLE [BLEEP] MATT'S GETTING UNDER MY SKIN THIS EVENING. HE'S SORTING CRAB WITH A FRICKIN' CHEESE SANDWICH IN HIS LEFT HAND. HE'S GOT TO BE EATING SOMETHING. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THAT GUY? HOW'S YOUR [BLEEP] SANDWICH? FOR A GUY TO STAND OUT THERE WITH A SANDWICH IN ONE HAND AND JUST START PITCHING CRAB WITH ANOTHER DOESN'T CUT IT IN MY BOOK. I'M SORRY. Narrator: THE SKIPPER'S PRESENCE IS ENOUGH. [ CLEARS THROAT ] Sig: SO, THIS CRAP IS GONNA STOP. IT'S STOPPING NOW. Narrator: THE CRAB COUNT. WITH 84,000 POUNDS IN HER HOLD, THE WIZARD HAS LEAPT AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE FLEET. Narrator: 270 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR ABOARD THE WIZARD JUST AFTER DAWN, CROSBY PREPARES A HOT MEAL FOR THE CREW -- THE FIRST THEY'VE HAD IN TWO DAYS. LeVeen: SINCE WE'RE RUNNING 24 HOURS A DAY, WE DON'T GET BREAKS. AND YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FIT IN YOUR OWN MEAL WHEN YOU CAN. YEAH, KEITH, DINNER'S READY, OR LUNCH OR BREAKFAST OR WHICHEVER MEAL YOU'D LIKE TO CALL THIS ONE. MAN. CHICKEN. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF VEGETABLES AND EVERYTHING ON THERE. MAN, OH, MAN, CROSBY. JUST UNWIND, HAVE A LITTLE DINNER. Narrator: WHILE THE CREW REFUELS, GREENHORN MOI IS TOO BROKEN TO LEAVE THE COMFORTS OF HIS BUNK. MOI WILL GET UP TO A NICE GALLEY TO CLEAN AND NO FOOD TO EAT. I THINK HE'D RATHER HAVE SLEEP THAN FOOD ANYWAYS. MMM. [ LAUGHS ] IT WAS WORTH STOPPING THE BOAT, NOT FOR THE FOOD, BUT JUST FOR THE CHANGE OF PACE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ COUGHING ] Narrator: AFTER A LUXURIOUS 30-MINUTE BREAK, THE MEN ARE RIGHT BACK TO THE GRIND. [ GRINDING ] HYDRO LEAK! Keith: OKAY. LET'S GET SOME PADS OUT AND CONTAIN IT  AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. IF THE HYDRAULIC FLUID LEAKS INTO THE HOLDING TANKS, ALL THE CRAB WILL PROBABLY DIE. THIS IS COSTING US TIME RIGHT NOW. Monte: OKAY, I'LL TURN IT ON FOR FOUR SECONDS. TWO SECONDS WILL BE QUICK ENOUGH. [ GRINDING ] HERE IT IS. IT'S THE RETURN PIPE. A LITTLE PINHOLE WILL BLOW THE WHOLE THING 'CAUSE YOU HAVE 1,800 POUNDS OF PRESSURE ON IT. OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED OUT HERE, JUST RIGHT NOW AT LEAST, IT IS NOT MY FAULT. SO, WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF ONE OF THESE WILL WORK. [ ALARM BLARES ] I'LL BE BACK. Narrator: WHILE THE CREW HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE HYDRO REPAIR, THE WIZARD HAS BEEN ADRIFT. Keith: WE HAD TO THROW OVER THE SIDE. I PULLED OUT OF GEAR INTO THE RIGHT BACK -- IT'S NOT IN THE WHEEL, BUT IT'S STUCK IN THE RUDDER. WE'RE DRAGGING THAT THING DOWN THE STRING WITH US. IT'S DEFINITELY IN THE RUDDER OR THE PROP OR WHATEVER. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND THROW IT, TRY TO GET IT ON THE WINCH HERE. [ CLANKING ] Narrator: IF THE RUDDER IS DISABLED, THE WIZARD WILL BE AT THE MERCY OF THE CURRENT AND REQUIRE A TOW BACK TO PORT. YOU WANT TO JUST TRY TO FORCE IT OUT OF THERE, RIP IT OUT? WE'RE GONNA TEAR SOMETHING OFF OR -- YEAH, GO FOR IT. ONE PROBLEM IS SOLVED WHEN LENNY FINISHES THE HOSE REPAIR. LeVeen: THIS IS A BAND-AID -- A GOOD BAND-AID, BUT IT'S NOT PERFECT. READY? YOU CAN HOP OVER HERE, KEITH. Narrator: ON THE STERN, A BIT OF LUCK. THERE IT GOES! THERE IT GOES! WHOO-HOO! WE GOT IT. IT'S OUT. RIGHT ON. Keith: THE OLD GIRL DOESN'T LIKE TO STOP, DOESN'T LIKE TO DRIFT. AND MAYBE WE'RE BEING PUNISHED FOR THAT GREAT MEAL THAT CROSBY MADE US. WATCH YOUR STEP. IT COULD BE SLICK. Soper: YEAH, WE'RE DONE HERE. WE FIXED OUR PROBLEMS. IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO BUSINESS. I'D KIND OF RATHER BE HAULING THAN FIXING... [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 160 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST, THE EARLY DAWN NEARS THE END OF HAULING HER 50-MILE PROSPECT STRING. BUT CAPTAIN RICK ONLY HAS A MEAGER 500 POUNDS TO SHOW. Fehst: ONE THING THAT'S GOOD -- WE'RE GETTING LOTS OF FRESH COD HERE. SO WHEN WE RESET, WE'RE GONNA BE BAITING THE HECK OUT OF THIS. I'VE BEEN AVERAGING ABOUT 5, 6 COD HERE -- BIG COD, SMALL COD, LOTS OF COD. Narrator: BUT THE CREW DIDN'T COME TO FISH FOR BAIT. BASICALLY, WE WASTED TWO DAYS. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE NO NUMBERS, DRAWING 4s, 5s, AND 6s, EVERYBODY'S DOWN. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER -- NOT THE USUAL ARGUING -- A LITTLE MORE INTENSE. Man: WELL, QUIT THROWING AWAY THE BAIT! I JUST SAW A NICE ONE GO OFF THE CHUTE. NO, YOU DIDN'T. OH, WHAT A... WE NEED THE BAIT! HANG THE BAIT! DUDE, I SEEN YOU IN THE LAST STRING. YOU WERE DRAGGIN' ASS. ONE POT -- WE GOT TIME IN BETWEEN. I WANT IT DONE. I'M TRYING TO MAKE A DOLLAR HERE, DUDE. BAD MORALE IS WHEN YOU'RE NOT MAKING NO MONEY. Mezich: WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE HAULING BLANK POTS, THAT'S WHEN YOU START GETTING PEOPLE GETTING PISSED OFF AT EACH OTHER. WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY ON THE SORT TABLE. WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP! Narrator: NOW WITH TWO DAYS WASTED, THE CREW STACKS THEIR GEAR, HOPING BETTER DAYS AND MORE FRUITFUL GROUNDS LIE AHEAD. ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH"... [ LAUGHS ] AS THE SEASON ROUNDS THE 30-DAY HUMP, GREENHORNS ARE PUT TO THE TEST... AS READY AS I'LL EVER BE. THESE GUYS ARE GONNA JUST BE BEAT TO HELL. ...AND ONE MAY BE HEADING HOME. JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE MY KID DON'T MEAN YOU GOT A [BLEEP] JOB. [ CHEERING ] NOW AS GROUNDS BREATHE SIGNS OF LIFE... [ CHEERING CONTINUES ] ...CAPTAINS DUKE IT OUT FOR THE TOP SPOT. YEAH!
