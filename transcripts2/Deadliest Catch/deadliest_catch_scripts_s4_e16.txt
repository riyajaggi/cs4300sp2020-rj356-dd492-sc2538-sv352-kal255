 THE CORNELIA MARIE MUST CATCH HER QUOTA. IT'S A BRUTAL CLOSE TO A BRUTAL SEASON. WE'RE JUST KILLING OURSELVES. THE SPRINT FOR THE FINISH LINE AND AN $80 MILLION CRAB FORTUNE STARTS NOW. [ MID-TEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ] WHOO! YEAH! AAH! Narrator: 255 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE CORNELIA MARIE IS A BOAT UNDER SIEGE. WITH NEARLY 145,000 POUNDS OF CRAB STILL TO CATCH, THE CREW AWAKES TO A DECK BLANKETED IN BOAT-CRIPPLING ICE, AND FOR NOW, FISHING IS AT A STANDSTILL. AT ONE POINT, YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH JUST IN SURVIVAL MODE WITH THIS ICE, YOU KNOW? JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE BOAT AFLOAT. THIS KIND OF WEATHER WILL JUST SWALLOW UP THE BOAT, YOU KNOW? [ JACKHAMMER BUZZES ] [ CLANG ] [ CRACK ] OH [BLEEP] [BLEEP] Narrator: WITH CAPTAIN PHIL OUT OF THE GAME, RELIEF SKIPPER MURRAY GAMRATH IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO HAUL IN THE CORNELIA MARIE'S QUOTA. AND NOW, AN ALREADY DIFFICULT TASK IS ABOUT TO BECOME NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE. OKAY. [ JACKHAMMERING CONTINUES ] ...I'M GONNA BE DELIVERING TO IN DUTCH HARBOR, AND I JUST GOT A DATE, AND IT'S A LITTLE EARLIER THAN I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING FOR, AND I'M NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, IN A RACE. AND IT REALLY KIND OF SUCKS. Narrator: THE ICE IS 70% CLEAR. BUT THAT WILL HAVE TO BE GOOD ENOUGH. IT'S SHOWTIME. NICE. PROBABLY ABOUT 500 KEEPERS. Narrator: THE POT LOOKS PROMISING, BUT IF THE NEGATIVE-5-DEGREE TEMPERATURE DROPS, THEY'LL BE SHUT DOWN AGAIN. Josh: IT'S KIND OF BORDERLINE FISHING RIGHT NOW. IT'S COLD ENOUGH TO WHERE THE CRAB CAN START GOING LEG-O EJECT-O, AND IF THAT HAPPENS, THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO QUIT BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE JUST BASICALLY FISHING POINTLESSLY. YOU'RE KILLING EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE BRINGING ABOARD. Narrator: IN SUCH BITTER CONDITIONS, THE CRAB CAN LOSE THEIR LEGS AND DIE. Gamrath: IF I START SEEING LEGS COMING OFF WHEN THEY HIT THE TANK, I'M JUST GONNA SHUT IT DOWN. Narrator: NOW THE CREW IS IN A RACE TO FILL THE BOAT AND BEAT THE FREEZE. 50 MILES TO THE EAST, THE NORTHWESTERN IS STEAMING FULL SPEED FOR WHAT CAPTAIN SIG HOPES WILL BE THEIR LAST STRING OF THE SEASON. Sig: HOPEFULLY, THERE'S CRAB HERE IN THESE 50 POTS. I'M HOPING TO TOP OFF THE MIDDLE TANK AND BE FULL. Narrator: THE FOUR-HOUR RUN GIVES THE CREW DOWNTIME TO REST AND RECHARGE, A RARE COMMODITY ABOARD THE NORTHWESTERN. [ BUZZING ] BUT BELOW DECK, EDGAR HANSEN IS UP TO NO GOOD. EDGAR'S PASSING UP BUNK TIME TO RIG UP A SURPRISE FOR BIG BROTHER SIG. IN THE HANSEN CLAN, SIBLING RIVALRY RUNS DEEP. I'D RATHER JUST WORK UNTIL MY EYES POP OUT OF MY HEAD AND THEN SLEEP. I GUARANTEE YOU, HE'S GONNA SNAP BEFORE I DO. EDGAR'S JUST BEING A [BLEEP] WHEN HE MESSED WITH ME, HE MESSED WITH THE WRONG GUY. FAMILY, FRIEND, OR FOE -- IT DON'T MATTER. Narrator: EDGAR'S PLAN IS DEVIOUSLY SIMPLE -- DRESS UP A FULL-SIZE DECK DUMMY... I'M GONNA PUT NICK'S JACKET ON THERE 'CAUSE HE SEEMS TO LOVE NICK MORE THAN HIS OWN BROTHERS. Narrator: ...THEN CHUCK IT OFF THE TOP OF THE WHEELHOUSE TO SCARE THE SKIPPER. I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS. I'M HERE TO MAKE MONEY. Mavar: IT'S ALL GOOD! I'M GONNA KICK THAT GUY'S ASS -- IMPERSONATING ME. AT LEAST HE'S SMILING. WHOO, I'M SWEATING. Narrator: BUT BEFORE EDGAR CAN PUT HIS PRANK INTO PLAY, THE CREW WILL NEED TO CATCH 17,000 POUNDS AND FILL THEIR TANKS. Sig: RIGHT NOW, WE'RE SO CLOSE, I FIGURE A 350-CRAB AVERAGE -- IT SHOULD JUST DO IT. IT SHOULD JUST TOP IT OFF. Narrator: WITH ONLY 49 POTS LEFT TO HAUL, THE COUNTDOWN TO THE END OF THE  NORTHWESTERN'S SEASON BEGINS. THE CLOCK IS ALSO TICKING DOWN TO EDGAR'S PRACTICAL JOKE. BUDDY, WE'RE GOING DOWN. COMING UP, THE MYSTERY OF A BOTTOMLESS CRAB TANK REVEALED. THAT PORT-AFT'S TANK'S STILL TAKING POT AFTER POT AFTER POT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH IT. Narrator: 240 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR ON THE WIZARD... CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN IS HOPING TO FINISH THE SEASON WITH ONE FINAL 20-POT STRING. BUT HE'S GOT A WEARY CREW, AN ICE-COVERED BOAT, AND A CRAB TANK THAT REFUSES TO FILL UP. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M WOUND UP ON THE LAST DAY, THE LAST STRING OF THE SEASON, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU'RE NOT WOUND UP WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THIS MUCH ICE ON THE BOAT, YOU'VE GOT A DEADLINE THAT YOU'RE FAST APPROACHING -- NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE -- AND YOU'VE GOT A 12- TO 18-HOUR RUN IN SUBSTANTIALLY NASTY WEATHER... Narrator: FOR THE PAST 36 HOURS, CAPTAIN KEITH'S CREW HAS STRUGGLED TO FILL THE BOAT'S PORT-AFT CRAB TANK. EXHAUSTION SET IN AS POT AFTER POT WENT INTO THE TANK WITHOUT MAKING A DENT IN IT. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THERE'S A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT. GOD, MAN, IT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S LIKE IN THE END, IT'S LIKE THE BOAT WINS. [ Laughing ] SHE JUST WON'T GIVE IT UP. THAT PORT-AFT TANK JUST WON'T GIVE UP, MAN. THEY'VE STUFFED THE OTHER THREE TANKS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING ELSE IN THOSE, AND THAT PORT ONE'S STILL TAKING JUST POT AFTER POT AFTER POT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH IT. Narrator: AFTER 135 POTS AND 70,000 KEEPERS, THE TANK IS THE SAME BOTTOMLESS PIT. ONE MORE POT AFTER THAT ONE, GUYS, ONE MORE. LAST ONE, COMING OVER THE RAIL! Narrator: IT'S DOWN TO THE LAST POT ON THE LAST STRING. WE GOT IT, BOYS! UH-OH. DON'T DISAPPEAR AGAIN. WHAT'S CROSBY JUMPING UP AND DOWN ABOUT? OH, IT'S FULL? Narrator: THE WEARY WARRIORS FINALLY TOP OFF THE NEVER-ENDING CRAB HOLD. LENNY, YOU'RE THE MAN. RIGHT ON, GUYS. YES. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. [BLEEP] UGH! THAT IS IT! [ MEN CHEERING ] [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S IT, GUYS! WE'RE OUT OF HERE! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! WHOO! RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE. LAST POT, SLAM THEM HOME. NOW, WE'RE GONNA JOINT THIS BABY RIGHT IN THE DITCH AND DUMP OFF ABOUT 425,000 POUNDS OF CRAB. Narrator: THE WIZARD CALLS IT A SEASON JUST IN TIME FOR THEIR DEADLINE, BUT BY THE TIME THE CREW ARE BACK INSIDE, THEIR PORT-AFT TANK IS NO LONGER STUFFED. 25 MILES TO THE NORTH, THE NORTHWESTERN REACHES THE END OF HER FINAL STRING. Sig: LAST POT COMING UP. AND I KNOW THEY'VE GOT THE HOOK READY TO FLAME THAT ON. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA THROW IT, THOUGH, TO GIVE US GOOD LUCK FOR THE NEXT SEASON. LAST POT OF THE SEASON COMING UP. IT'S ALL FOR GOOD LUCK. AND HE GETS IT! I GUESS THE FUN PART ABOUT THROWING THAT LAST POT AND THE FLAMING HOOK -- YOU GOT TO WAIT TILL NEXT SEASON TO SEE IF IT WORKS. Mavar: I'M GLAD IT'S OVER. KILLER SEASON. EVERYBODY'S HAPPY. NO MAJOR BREAKDOWNS HERE AT THE END. I GOT TWO THINGS LEFT ON MY AGENDA. THE FIRST THING IS TO SCARE THE HELL OUT OF THAT GUY. THE SECOND IS TO GET SOME SLEEP. THE FISHING'S HARD ENOUGH. THEN ADD THE ICE FACTOR INTO IT. BEAT ME UP THIS TRIP. WE MOVED A LOT OF GEAR, AND WE BEAT A HELL OF A LOT OF ICE. AND I'M NOT 20 YEARS OLD ANYMORE. NOW THEY'RE FLAMING THE TABLE. [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, I DON'T THINK MOM DID A GOOD JOB TEACHING US NOT TO PLAY WITH... [ POP ] ...MATCHES WHEN WE WERE KIDS OR SEAL BOMBS THAT JUST WENT OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHS ] IF IT'S NOT FIRE, IT'S BOMBS. [ LAUGHS ] YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT IT, THE GUYS HAVE FUN. THEY CAN WORK THEIR ASS OFF, AND THEY CAN FREEZE AND PRACTICALLY BE TORTURED, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE END OF THE SEASON, YOU KNOW, IF THEY LOOK BACK AND THEY DID WELL AND THEY HAD FUN DOING IT, YOU KNOW, IT'S WORTH IT. THEY GET A PAYCHECK OUT OF THE DEAL. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. BUT THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SO LONG THAT IT MAKES IT EASIER, AND SO YOU CAN HAVE GOOD TIMES AND BAD TIMES, BUT I THINK THE GOOD TIMES OUTWEIGH THE BAD, 10 TO 1. [ LAUGHING ] [ THUMPING ] ARE THEY DE-ICING THE BOAT NOW? SIG! OVERBOARD! YOU OKAY?! ARE YOU OKAY?! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] HOLD ON! HOLD ON! DAMN IT! HOLD ON! ARGH! OHH! OHH! OHH! OHH! Sig: [ LAUGHS ] I COULD TELL IT WAS A DUMMY RIGHT OFF THE BAT! DAMN IT! YOUR GUY'S LEGS WERE ALL CROOKED! [ LAUGHS ] DAMN IT! [ LAUGHS ] Mavar: THEY MADE ME DO IT! YOU CAUGHT 'EM, THOUGH! I COULD SEE IT WAS A DUMMY BECAUSE THE LEGS WENT DOWN ALL CROOKED LIKE THAT. I GO, "THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S A PERSON." [ LAUGHS ] PIECE OF CRAP! I HATE YOU! YOU'RE FIRED! [ Laughing ] "FIRED." FOUR HOURS. I GIVE YOU FOUR HOURS. YOU GIVE ME THAT? "A" FOR EFFORT. "D" FOR EXECUTION. YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE! YOU NEED TO SET THESE THINGS UP. YOU GOT TO FOCUS. PRANKS ARE JUST LIKE FISHING, MAN -- SERIOUS BUSINESS. CROOKED LEGS, WINDSHIELD, NAH. Narrator: COMING UP... WHILE THE CORNELIA MARIE BATTLES ICE AND A DEADLINE... WE'VE GOT TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE TASK AT HAND. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN PHIL FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE. I HATE THIS. Narrator: 255 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE CORNELIA MARIE PLOWS TOWARDS THE END OF HER SEASON. AS THE RELIEF SKIPPER HEADS TO THE LAST STRING, THE WEARY AND BATTERED CREW TAKE AN HOUR BREATHER. THE GUYS ARE WORN OUT. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH SEASON. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FEW ACHES AND PAINS, YOU HAVEN'T WORKED YOUR TAIL OFF. Narrator: HARSH WEATHER AND HARD FISHING ARE EXACTING A TOLL OF PAIN. JOSH HARRIS SEVERELY SPRAINED HIS BACK PUSHING 300-POUND TOTES ACROSS THE DECK. AND FREDDY MAUGHTAI IS SUFFERING FROSTBITE ON HIS EARS. Maughtai: IT WAS A LOT COLDER YESTERDAY THAN TODAY -- BUT THE THING, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WORE THAT HOOD THING, IT'S JUST ONE OR TWO, AND THEN IT'S SO HOT ON MY HEAD, YOU KNOW? NO, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE TIP OF MY EARS, AND THEN I'M NOT GONNA GET LAID FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, SO I'LL DEAL WITH THE HOT AND HEAT. I'M GONNA TRY HARD TO COVER UP BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET MESSED UP. Narrator: AND TO ROUND OUT THE LIST OF THE WALKING WOUNDED, DECKHAND MARK ANDERSON COPES WITH A SHATTERED PELVIS AFTER FALLING A FEW STORIES FROM A LADDER WHILE DOING REPAIRS ON THE BOAT. THEY PUT HIS PELVIS BACK TOGETHER WITH WIRES AND SCREWS. AND NOW SOMETHING'S BROKEN LOOSE. THAT'S HARD-CORE, MAN. I DON'T KNOW, IT MIGHT BE A SCREW OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T FEEL ALL THAT GOOD. HE'S GOT A BUNCH OF METAL IN HIS HIP. 24 SCREWS OR SOMETHING. ONE OF THEM JUST POPPED OUT. IT'S ROLLING AROUND IN HIM. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. FEELS LIKE A NEEDLE. SOMEBODY JABBING A NEEDLE IN YOU... ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES, WHEN I TURN. Josh: WHICH IS ALL THE TIME ON THE BOAT, RIGHT? YOU GET A WORKOUT ON THIS BOAT JUST WALKING FROM THE BACK OF THE BOAT TO THE FRONT OF THE BOAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING. THE BOAT'S MAKING 10-, 12-, 14-DEGREE PITCHES ALL THE TIME, SO IT'S A HARD PLACE TO HEAL. Narrator: BY NIGHTFALL, THE CREW RETURNS TO BUSINESS. WITH THE FINAL DEADLINE IN JUST TWO DAYS, THE BATTERED CREW MUST SUCK UP THE PAIN... AND GRIND TO THE FINISH. Mark: COLD, WET, AND MISERABLE. THE ONLY THING THAT'S THE BRIGHT SIDE DOING THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF CRAB WE'RE GETTING. Narrator: WITH A LITTLE LUCK AND ANOTHER 95,000 POUNDS OF CRAB, THEIR SEASON SHOULD BE COMING TO AN END IN ANOTHER 180 POTS. Josh: IT'S NOT THAT BAD. YEAH, IT'S NOT BAD AT ALL. PRETTY GOOD FISHING RIGHT NOW. Millman: WELL, WE'RE CLOSE TO BEING DONE WITH THIS, WE'RE STARTING TO GET ANXIOUS ABOUT GOING HOME, YOU KNOW? IT REALLY STARTS TO CREEP INTO YOUR MIND. AS FOR NOW, WE'VE GOT TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE TASK AT HAND. AND THAT'S 1.2 MILLION POUNDS OF CRAB. Narrator: 2,100 MILES FROM HIS BOAT AND CREW, OUTSIDE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, IS CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS. THE BLOOD PHIL WAS COUGHING UP WASN'T FROM HIS BROKEN RIBS, BUT RATHER, REMNANTS OF A BLOOD CLOT THAT PASSED THROUGH HIS HEART. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IN THE MEDICAL WORLD HOW BIG IT IS, BUT TO ME, THIS THING IS HUGE, YOU KNOW, AND IT'S NOT ONE -- YOU GOT TO DO IT KIND OF SLOW. YOU CAN'T JUST POP IT IN THERE AND ZIP IT OUT. AND IT STINGS LIKE CRAZY. SO, MY STOMACH'S LIKE A PINCUSHION, YOU KNOW? BUT IT'S KEEPING ME ALIVE. BOY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- THAT STINGS, WHEW. Narrator: AFTER INJECTING ANOTHER DOSE OF LOVENOX INTO HIS GUT, PHIL HEADS BACK TO THE HOSPITAL FOR HIS DAILY CHECKUP. Phil: YOU KNOW, WHEN WE'RE CRABBING AND YOU'RE LIVING ON THE EDGE, IT'S JUST DIFFERENT. IT'S DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW, WE COME CLOSE TO DYING A LOT CRABBING, AND THAT DOESN'T BOTHER ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M IN CONTROL OF SOMETHING. WITH THIS, I HAVE NO CONTROL. AND THAT'S THE SCARY THING. NO, I HAVEN'T TOLD THE KIDS HOW SERIOUS THIS IS, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO... NUMBER ONE, WORRY ABOUT ME, BUT, NUMBER TWO, WORRY ABOUT ME WHEN THEY'RE FISHING. AND ALSO, I WANTED TO SEE THEM AND TALK TO THEM AND SPEND TIME WITH THEM. THEY TELL ME I WON'T SURVIVE IT A SECOND TIME AND I WAS REALLY, REALLY LUCKY THE FIRST TIME, AND THE ODDS ARE LIKE 2 OUT OF 10 OF SURVIVING THIS THING. AND SO, THE BAD PART ABOUT IT IS I DON'T KNOW IF MY FISHING CAREER IS OVER, YOU KNOW? THAT'S GONNA BE A DEVASTATING DEAL FOR ME IF IT IS. Narrator: COMING UP, AFTER A HARD-CORE SEASON... IT'S ALL A BLUR. ...A HARD-CORE CREW SEES THE LIGHT. RIGHT NOW WE CAN SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. YEAH! Narrator: AS DAWN BREAKS 240 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT CREW APPROACHES HOUR 42 OF A MARATHON GRIND. I COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW MANY HOURS WE'VE BEEN WORKING. I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE TOOK A ROTO-ROOTER IN MY STOMACH AND JUST... TOO MUCH COFFEE TO STAY UP... CANDY. [ SIGHS ] THEY'RE ALL LOOKING THE SAME! EIGHT LEGS. TWO CLAWS. A SHELL. IT'S ALL A BLUR. Narrator: SINCE JANUARY, THE TIME BANDIT BOYS HAVE CAPTURED OVER 564,000 POUNDS OF CRAB FOR $987,000. AWW... HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Narrator: BUT WITH CAPTAIN ANDY'S DEADLINE RAPIDLY APPROACHING... Andy: I REALLY ONLY HAVE 48 HOURS TO LOAD THIS BOAT OR PUT 100,000 POUNDS ON IT. Narrator: ...HE ORDERS BIG BROTHER JOHNATHAN TO LEND A HAND FOR THE LAST 10,000 POUNDS. SIX GUYS WORKING THAT TABLE. A MOUND OF CRABS GOING DOWN EVERY THREE MINUTES NOW INSTEAD OF EVERY FIVE. 60 MORE POTS AT THE MOST. HOPEFULLY, ONLY 30. ♪ ONCE A REBEL, ALWAYS A REBEL, NOW ♪ ♪ ONCE A REBEL, ALWAYS A REBEL, NOW ♪ [ INDISTINCT MUSIC PLAYS ] RIGHT NOW WE CAN SEE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. 340 IN THAT ONE! Scott: I GOT MY SECOND WIND RIGHT NOW. IT TOOK ABOUT FIVE POTS FOR MY HANDS TO FINALLY WORK NORMAL AGAIN. YOU CAN ALWAYS GET ONE MORE IN THERE. YEAH! HELL, YEAH! WHOO! WHOO! WHOO! [ BLOWING ] WALKING ON WATER, BABY! I THINK THAT'S FULL. IT SURE IS GONNA BE NICE TO BE AWAY FROM YOU GUYS FOR A WHILE. I CAN'T WAIT TO NOT SEE YOU AGAIN IN A WEEK. DON'T BOTHER CALLING ME. I'LL BE OKAY WITH IT. I'VE ALREADY ERASED YOUR PHONE NUMBER. OH, YEAH. SEASON'S OVER FOR THE TIME BANDIT. YEAH, BROTHER! A LITTLE CRAB SHUFFLE. EVERYTHING'S GOOD! Narrator: WITH ONE POT LEFT TO PULL, CAPTAIN ANDY GIVES GREENHORN EARON OVERSON A SHOT AT THE RAIL. MY FIRST TIME THROWING THE HOOK -- LAST POT OF THE SEASON. NOPE, HE AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT. LET'S HOPE HE DOESN'T THROW IT AND GOES OVER WITH THE ROPE. Andy: YEAH, THIS KID CAME OUT, HE'S NEVER CRAB-FISHED BEFORE IN HIS LIFE, GOT SICK FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS, AND HE'S RALLIED BACK EVER SINCE. HE'S ALWAYS SMILING, AND HE'S WORKING HIS ASS OFF. HE'LL DO WHATEVER YOU TELL HIM TO DO. THAT'S THE KIND OF GUY YOU WANT, WITH AMBITION. NOT BAD. NOT BAD FOR HIS FIRST TIME! WHAT? WHAT? EARON'S GRADUATED FROM BEING THE GREEN DING-A-LING, TO THE GREEN DING-A-LING THAT'S THROWN THE HOOK. YOU DID GOOD. Overson: I GUESS THEY DIDN'T TRUST ME ENOUGH. THAT'S WHY THEY NEVER LET ME DO IT BEFORE. BUT ALL RIGHT! THAT WAS WORTH IT! WHOO-HOO! WE'RE GOING TO TOWN AS SOON  AS WE DUMP THIS ONE, GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERING ] PUT YOUR WOMEN  AND CHILDREN TO BED. THAT'S ME. I'M GOING TO BED. [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] YOU'RE DONE! YOU'RE DONE! BE HAPPY! TO TOWN, TO TOWN, TO TOWN. AND THEN ANDY WON'T BE CAPTAIN ANDY ANYMORE. HE'LL JUST BE ANDY. THEY'RE OUT THERE... THEY'RE, LIKE, SHELL-SHOCKED. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM, BOOM! SEAL BOMBS GOING OFF ALL AROUND. BOOM! BOOM! NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY'RE JUST... WE GET THAT LAST CRAB IN PORT, AND THEN HE'LL JUST BE PLAIN OLD ANDY AGAIN. I'LL BE ABLE TO TALK TO HIM. [ LAUGHS ] Andy: WE'RE DONE. DEALER, DONE. CLEARING TABLE, NOTHING IN THE HANDS. Narrator: COMING UP, A BREWING RIVALRY BOILS OVER. LITTLE "H" FROM OVER THERE, POSSIBLY TRYING TO UNDERCUT ME. [BLEEP] WHINY [BLEEP] I'D FIRE HIS ASS. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: 255 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR ON THE CORNELIA MARIE, A STAND-IN SKIPPER AND FIVE GRITTY WARRIORS HAVE FOUGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH PAIN AND UNCERTAINTY TO THEIR FINAL STRING AND THEIR FINAL POTS OF THIS OPILIO SEASON. Gamrath: IT'S BEEN A LONG SEASON FOR EVERYBODY. THE GUYS, THEY'RE READY TO ALL GO HOME. Millman: IT WAS A BRUTAL TRIP. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN HAPPIER TO END A TRIP AND A SEASON IN MY LIFE. WE GOT ONE MORE POT, AND THAT'S GONNA TOP OFF THIS TANK AND GIVE US A FULL LOAD. Narrator: THEIR TANKS ARE OVERFLOWING WITH 295,000 POUNDS OF OPIES. SOON, THIS BROKEN AND BATTERED CREW CAN BLEED ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. YOU KNOW, AFTER IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE HERE, THEY'RE GONNA MAKE ABOUT $50,000. IT'S HARD WORK, BUT THERE'S GOOD MONEY. WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN IS CALLED "STUFFING THE TANKS 101." LAST POT OF THE SEASON RIGHT HERE. TOPPING IT OFF. NOW, THIS IS HOW YOU END THE SEASON. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, GUYS, NICE JOB. THIS ONE'S ALL WRAPPED UP. EVERYBODY IN THE POOL! YOU KNOW THE RULES. LAST BIT OF CRABS GETTING STUFFED IN THE TANK. WE'RE ON OUR WAY BACK. THAT FINALIZES IT RIGHT THERE. THE BRUISE CRUISE CAME TO AN END. Narrator: WITH THE TANKS FULL, THE SKIPPER MUST NOW RACE TO PORT FOR A DEADLINE IN JUST 18 HOURS. GOING HOME TO SEE THE FAMILY, SEE MY PAPPY, SEE MY GRANDMA, SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM... HAVE SOME FUN. WE GOT 295,000 ON THE BOAT RIGHT NOW, WHICH WILL PUT US AT 1.1 MILLION, SO WE GOT OUR QUOTA. DONE DEAL. IN THE BOOKS. I'M GONNA GO SPEND SOME TIME WITH MY DAD, MAKE SURE HE'S ALL RIGHT, AND JUST HANG OUT WITH HIM FOR A WHILE. Narrator: FOR THE MEN OF THE CORNELIA MARIE, THE HUNT FOR CRAB IS OVER. 70 MILES NORTHEAST OF THE FISHING GROUNDS, IN ST. PAUL HARBOR, THE WIZARD BEGINS OFF-LOADING HER LAST TRIP OF 425,000 POUNDS. AS THE FINAL BRAILER IS LIFTED FROM THE PORT-AFT TANK, DECK BOSS GARY SOPER MAKES AN UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY. YES, WHAT'S UP?! SO, UNLOADING TODAY, WE GOT DOWN IN THE TANKS TO CLEAN THEM OUT. WE DISCOVERED WE HAD A PRETTY SIZABLE HOLE UP THERE. YOU KNOW, A WATERMELON-SIZED HOLE OR THEREABOUTS, AND WE ASSUME THAT THAT MIGHT BE PROBABLY WHERE SOME CRAB WERE GOING, SO, RIGHT HERE, WE FOUND A HOLE. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THE CRABS COULD GET OUT OF THAT, YEAH. THAT COULD BE WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO FILL THIS TANK UP. Narrator: THE HOLE IN THE TANK COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY ALLOWED MORE THAN 20,000 POUNDS OF CRAB TO RETURN BACK TO THE SEA. THAT'S WHERE THEY PROBABLY STARTED JUST GOING RIGHT BACK OUT THE SIDE OF THE BOAT. I DON'T KNOW. WE ALWAYS MAKE THE BOTTOMLESS JOKES, ONLY THIS TIME, IT ACTUALLY CAME TRUE. I WOULD SAY "BUFFOON." BUFFOON'S A GOOD WORD. THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW. THAT EXPLAINS WHY IT KEPT CHOKING AND CHOKING AND CHOKING. AND WOULDN'T TOP OFF. IT WAS JUST LIKE A FREEWAY -- AS QUICK AS WE WERE CATCHING THEM, WE'RE LETTING THEM GO. Narrator: 270 MILES TO THE SOUTH IN DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA, THE TIME BANDIT BEGINS HER FINAL OFFLOAD OF THE SEASON. VERY SUCCESSFUL TRIP. WE DID WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO. THE BOYS ARE TIRED, CRYING LIKE LITTLE BABIES, AS A MATTER OF FACT. Newberry: JUST BECAUSE WE HAULED OUR LAST POT OF OPILIO DOESN'T MEAN THE SEASON IS OVER. WE STILL GOT TO GET HOME. WE PLUGGED THE BOAT, SO NO CRYBABIES. WHOO! Narrator: AS THE TIME BANDIT'S CATCH IS UNLOADED, TWO SEASONS OF COMPETITION AND RIVALRY BETWEEN DECKHAND SHEA LONG AND CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN'S SON, SCOTTIE, COME TO A HEAD. EARLIER THIS SEASON, ANDY, YOU KNOW, ME AND HIM HAD TALKED. I TOLD HIM I KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING THE BOAT, AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT I WANTED, AND HE'S LOOKING FOR A GUY THAT WANTS TO BE TOTALLY INVOLVED WITH IT, AND I NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO SHEA. SHEA FOUND OUT. THERE'S SOME RUMORS FLYING AROUND ABOUT LITTLE "H" OVER THERE POSSIBLY TRYING TO UNDERCUT ME. SHEA GOT PRETTY UPSET. HE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF GOING OUT THERE JUST TO TRAIN ME, SO HE WAS GONNA QUIT. THAT WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE ME A VERY UNHAPPY PERSON. I THINK ME GOING OUT WITH SHEA WOULD WORK. JOHNATHAN OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO SEE HIS KID TAKE OVER THE BOAT. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT. I'D FIRE HIS ASS. [ LAUGHS ] [BLEEP] WHINY [BLEEP] Narrator: IN A FINAL PUSH, THE EARLY DAWN OVERTAKES THE WIZARD AND FINISHES THE SEASON IN THE LEAD. Narrator: AS DAWN BREAKS IN DUTCH HARBOR, THE CRAB FLEET RACES FOR HOME AND THEIR FINAL OFF-LOADS. [ BIRD CRIES ] AFTER EIGHT WEEKS OF MATCHING MUSCLE AND WITS AGAINST MOTHER NATURE AND THE BERING SEA, 240 BRAVE ADVENTURERS RETURN TO PORT TO WEIGH IN AND CASH OUT. THE CORNELIA MARIE RETURNED TO PORT WITH A SUBSTITUTE SKIPPER... A BATTERED CREW THAT REFUSED TO QUIT... THE OLD MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN REAL PROUD OF US WITH THIS CATCH, YOU KNOW? WE LOADED THE BOAT PRETTY MUCH AS FULL AS IT COULD BE. Narrator: ...AND THE LAST 295,000 POUNDS OF CRAB THEY NEEDED TO CLOSE OUT CAPTAIN PHIL'S QUOTA. WE'VE GOT ABOUT 295,000 POUNDS THAT WE JUST DELIVERED. ALL IN ALL, IT WAS A DECENT TRIP. EMPTY TANK, AND IT'S TIME TO GO HOME. Josh: GO HOME, TALK TO MY DAD AND STUFF AND SEE WHAT DIRECTION HE WANTS ME TO GO, BUT MY WHOLE GOAL WAS TO PROVE TO HIM THAT I COULD BE A FISHERMAN. I DON'T KNOW, AFTER LOOKING AT HIM, IF THAT'S WHAT I WANT. IT'S IN MY BLOOD. IT RUNS THROUGH MY VEINS AND EVERYTHING. THAT'S A PRETTY BIG REALITY CHECK. I WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY SOMEDAY. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN HIS POSITION. YOU KNOW, HE'S 50 YEARS OLD, AND HE JUST ABOUT CHECKED OUT ON US A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, SO IT'S KIND OF A SCARY THING. Narrator: THE NORTHWESTERN PULLED INTO TOWN WITH HER TANKS PACKED WITH 210,000 POUNDS OF KEEPERS... EVERYBODY'S HAPPY. WE'RE GOING HOME. ...AND A SEASON THAT WILL MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE HANSEN CLAN'S RECORD BOOKS. Edgar: WE FILLED THE BOAT THREE TIMES IN THREE DAYS OR LESS. I MEAN, THAT'S BEEN STELLAR. THIS SEASON'S JUST BEEN UNREAL TO ME. AS FAR AS SEASONS GO, THIS IS ONE FOR THE BOOKS FOR ME. THIS IS GOING TO BE A REAL MEMORABLE SEASON FOR ME. EVEN THOUGH WE HAD OUR TROUBLES HERE AND THERE -- WE HAD TO MOVE BECAUSE OF THE ICE, TEMPERATURES THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, 20-, 30-, 40-BELOW WITH WINDCHILL -- AND WE STILL LANDED ON PHENOMENAL FISHING. IT'S A CINDERELLA STORY, YOU KNOW? THEY DON'T HAPPEN THAT OFTEN. NORTHWESTERN, SIGNING OFF. OH, YEAH -- "THE END." Narrator: AFTER WEIGHING IN WITH A FINAL LOAD OF 190,000 POUNDS, THE TIME BANDIT HEADED FOR HOME IN HOMER, ALASKA. [ AIR HORN BLOWS ] COMING IN! TIE UP! SEASON'S OVER! [ AIR HORN BLOWS ] IS THAT MANDY? LOOK, THERE'S DADDY! THERE'S DADDY! [ LAUGHS ] LET'S SEE THE LITTLE GUY. [ LAUGHS ] YOU DON'T LOOK TOO HAPPY! LOOK AT THOSE MITTS! HERE, I'LL GET HIM OUT FOR YOU. HOW YOU DOING? HI, BUDDY! LOOK AT THAT GUY! HEY, BUDDY. ISN'T HE BIG? WELCOME TO HOMER. GLAD TO BE BACK. DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A PARTY? THIS IS 20 FEET OF ROLLING THUNDER. I'M THE CAPTAIN OF THIS SHIP! YEAH! Narrator: WITH THE FINAL TALLIES IN, THE WIZARD FINISHED THEIR SEASON WITH 1.4 MILLION POUNDS OF OPILIO CRAB, WORTH $2.5 MILLION. THE DECKHANDS' SHARE WAS $68,000 EACH. THE TIME BANDIT BOYS HAULED IN A TOTAL OF 574,000 POUNDS FOR THE SEASON AND BANKED $1 MILLION FOR THE BOAT. TAKE-HOME PAY FOR EACH DECKHAND -- $52,000. THE HANSEN CLAN AND THE NORTHWESTERN NETTED A HEALTHY 850,000 POUNDS OF CRAB WORTH $1.4 MILLION. EACH CREW MEMBER HAULED IN $47,000. FINALLY, AFTER A ROLLER-COASTER SEASON, THE CORNELIA MARIE WAS ABLE TO LAND THE LAST OF HER 1.2 MILLION POUNDS OF CRAB, WORTH $1.3 MILLION. EACH DECKHAND LEFT THE DOCKS WITH $50,000. THE FINAL TALLIES ARE IN THE BOOKS, AND THE CRAB FORTUNE IS ALREADY BURNING A HOLE IN THE POCKETS OF THE FISHERMEN WHO EARNED EVERY PENNY THE HARD WAY. 1,900 MILES SOUTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, JOSH AND JAKE HARRIS ARE REUNITED WITH THEIR DAD, AFTER BRAVING THE BERING SEA WITHOUT HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME. WELL, YOU KNOW, THE DEAL IS -- AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU GUYS -- I WAS PRETTY SICK WHEN I GOT HOME, AND I DAMN NEAR DIED. I JUST ABOUT BIT IT, AND I'M LIVING KIND OF DAY BY DAY RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, WHERE IT COULD BE THE LAST. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I'M GONNA BE FISHING AGAIN OR WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I'M HAPPY WE'RE HERE TO SEE YOU, POPS. I'M GLAD TO BE HERE, TOO, BUDDY. I LOVE YOU. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS MIGHT BE DOING THIS WITHOUT ME. YOU BOTH HAVE BEEN TAUGHT WELL ENOUGH, YOU KNOW. YOU GUYS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHINE. AND WE'LL JUST PRAY THAT I CAN GO, BUT IF I CAN'T, YOU GUYS, I FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH ABOUT EITHER ONE OF YOU. YOU KNOW, IT'S A HARD THING TO TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW. I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME, SINCE I WAS 7, AND THAT MIGHT ALL BE COMING TO AN END. Narrator: FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS, THE BERING SEA FISHERMAN WILL HEAL THE WOUNDS OF BODY AND SOUL. AND THE STEEL WITH WHICH THEY PLY THEIR TRADE WILL LAY RUSTING AND DORMANT UNTIL THEY ARE ONCE AGAIN CALLED TO ACTION. THIS YEAR, THE CRAB FLEET ESCAPED WITH JUST ONE TRAGEDY. ONLY ONE MAN WAS LOST. BUT JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER THE CRABBERS LEFT DUTCH, THE BERING SEA SENT A CHILLING REMINDER THAT SHE IS A COLD AND HEARTLESS MISTRESS.
