 OLD CHARTS, AND DUMB LUCK AND PLOTTED A 300-MILE COURSE TOWARDS THE NORTHERN END OF THE FISHING GROUNDS. FIRST CRAB POT OF THE SEASON! ROCK 'N' ROLL. GOING NOW. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. LET HER GO. Narrator: THE FIRST STRINGS OF A BRAND-NEW SEASON WERE SET... BUT TEST POT SHOWED LITTLE SIGNS OF LIFE. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I DON'T HAVE A CLUE ON WHAT'S GOING ON. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT WHERE IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY BLANK. WE OBVIOUSLY SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH PLAN "A". Narrator: NOW CAPTAINS FACE A NEW ROADBLOCK -- A MASSIVE ARCTIC WEATHER SYSTEM BARRELS TOWARDS THE FLEET AND THE HUNT CONTINUES. 150 MILES TO THE NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN IS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH AN ARCTIC STORMFRONT. TONIGHT, NORTHWEST WIND 40 KNOTS. SEAS 21 FEET. RAIN. 35- TO 40-KNOT WINDS COMING OUR WAY TONIGHT, AND I SUSPECT WE'RE GONNA GET SPANKED A LITTLE BIT BY THE TIME WE GET UP THERE, BUT EITHER WAY, THESE POTS ARE GOING IN THE WATER TONIGHT. Narrator: AS THE STORMFRONT BUILDS ON THE HORIZON, SIG ORDERS THE CREW TO BATTEN DOWN THE DECK. Edgar: IT'S PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE. THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE OF A BOAT. IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE BEING SAFE, WE'RE JUST BEING CAUTIOUS -- TAKING CARE OF OUR STUFF. Sig: IF THE WEATHER DOES TURN NORTHEAST, LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO, THE BOAT'S GONNA GET A LITTLE ROLY. AND IF YOU DON'T GET THE CHAINS ON, THE STACK CAN START TO MOVE AROUND QUITE A BIT. WE'VE HAD WEATHER WHERE IT WAS NASTY. I MEAN, REAL NAUTICAL STORM, AND LOST POTS OVER THE STERN, POTS STARTED TO SHAKE LOOSE, HANGING OFF THE SIDE OF THE BOAT BY ONE TIE. SO YOU GOT TO DO IT. Narrator: AFTER SIX HOURS OF SECURING THE NORTHWESTERN FOR THE COMING STORM, EDGAR FINDS DIVINE INSPIRATION IN A MOST UNLIKELY PLACE. THAT'S JESUS CHRIST ON MY BLOCK. THERE'S THE NOSE. THERE'S THE MUSTACHE, THE MOUTH. EYE. EYE. THERE'S THE HAIR. HE'S LOOKING THAT WAY. WE ROLL WITH GOD, MAN. Narrator: FOUR HOURS LATER... DAMN! JUST ROLLING. THE WEATHER'S COMING UP A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE GONNA GET THIS LOAD OFF BEFORE IT REALLY STARTS BLOWING. Narrator: CHAINED OR NOT, THE HIGH STACK HAS DESTABILIZED THE BOAT. IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY. Narrator: SIG IS FORCED TO DROP HIS GEAR 50 MILES SHORT OF HIS TARGET. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE GEAR SET. NOW THE WIND HAS DECIDED TO CHANGE DIRECTION BY ALMOST 20 DEGREES. AND WHEN IT CHANGES ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEN YOU GET THESE CONFUSED SEAS. SO NOW YOU HAVE SEAS THAT ARE COMING FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, AND IT'S HARD TO MAKE IT SAFE WHEN THINGS GET KIND OF SQUIRRELLY. READY? ROGER! Narrator: THE LAST HANSEN TO GAMBLE NEAR THESE GROUNDS WAS SIG'S FATHER, SVERRE, NEARLY 25 YEARS AGO. Sig: ALL I CAN DO NOW IS HOPE THAT WE HIT SOMETHING, GET A LITTLE LIFE OUT OF THIS PLACE IF THERE'S ANYTHING CRAWLING DOWN THERE. Edgar: WEATHER'S GETTING SNOTTY. IT'S WORSE WHEN YOU GOT POTS ON TOP AND A GUY UP THERE. WE'RE BUCKING INTO IT. SWELL 35. PROBABLY GOT A 15. 12-, 15-FOOT SWELL. YEAH, OKAY. 17-FOOT SWELL. ME AND MATT ARE HAVING A GREAT TIME. IT'S GREAT OUT HERE. THIS JOB IS SO EASY. BLOWING THE WAY IT IS, IT MAKES THE BOAT ROLL MORE, WHICH WEARS THEM OUT, SO IF THEY'RE A LITTLE PISSY RIGHT NOW, I DON'T BLAME THEM A [BLEEP] BIT. 'CAUSE I'M PISSY. Narrator: AFTER 78 POTS SPLASH THE WATER, SIG CALLS DOWN TO EDGAR FOR A LITTLE INSURANCE. DID ANYBODY TAKE CARE  OF YOUR LITTLE RITUAL BEFORE WE SET THIS LOAD? DAMN IT! Narrator: FOR THE PAST 11 YEARS, EDGAR HAS BITTEN THE HEAD OFF OF A HERRING FOR GOOD LUCK. THIS IS FOR GOOD LUCK, BABY. IT'S NOT TOO BAD. I'M STARTING TO FREAK OUT, MAN. OUR LITTLE GOOD-LUCK DEAL IS DWINDLING. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY FORGOT IT. SIG ASKED IF WE'VE DONE OUR YEARLY SEASONAL RITUAL -- THE BITING OF THE HERRING -- AND WE HAVE NOT YET. IT'S GOT TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS LAST POT'S OFF THE BOAT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY'S BITING THE HEAD OFF OF SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, A LITTLE LUCK NEVER HURT ANY FISHERMAN. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. Narrator: 150 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, THE 155-FOOT WIZARD SURGES THROUGH THE RISING STORM. Keith: THERE'S BEEN A FEW 20-FOOTERS ROLLING THROUGH, BUT IT'S KIND OF CLASSIC BERING SEA WEATHER TONIGHT. Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN'S SEASON IS ALREADY OFF TO A ROCKY START. HIS HULL WAS COMPROMISED AND A LUCKY CHARM LOST. BASICALLY, I WON'T SET GEAR UNLESS I'M FORCED TO WITHOUT A CUP O' NOODLES CUP UP HERE TO USE FOR MY SPITTOON. Narrator: NOW, WITH SEAS AT 20 FEET AND RISING, KEITH MUST RELY ON HIS VETERAN DECKHANDS TO COACH THE GREENHORNS THROUGH BRUTAL CONDITIONS. Keith: WHEN THE WEATHER FIRST KICKS UP LIKE THIS, GUYS JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS. YOU KNOW, BUT WE DO HAVE TWO KIDS OUT THERE, SO YOU'LL BE HEARING SOPER BARKING. YOU'LL BE HEARING MONTE BARKING. THAT'S PART OF THE JOB -- MISERY. MISERY IS PART OF THE JOB! THIS IS THE FIRST DANG TASTE OF REAL WEATHER, SO THEY JUST NEED TO GET THEIR SEA LEGS, GET USED TO COMING UP AND DOWN THE DECK WITH THE BOAT PITCHING, AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'LL GET IT DOWN. JUST ANOTHER DAY ON THE WIZARD. Soper: COME ON IN! COME ON! GRAB THAT SMALL FISH RIGHT THERE. AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE OVER HERE? MONTE TOLD ME TO STAND BACK -- [ SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] YOU JUST CAN'T WIN, CAN YOU? I NEED A BAG AND NICE FRESH COD. WHERE'S THAT KID AT? GUYS, WE NEED THE WANDERING UP AND DOWN THE DECK MODE TO END. THEY'VE BEEN COMPLETELY OUT OF POSITION ON EVERY SINGLE POT. THEY'RE JUST KIND OF RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES A LITTLE TOO MUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT I DO NEED IS I NEED ANOTHER BAIT JAR. LIKE THE WIND! THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING A GREENHORN, YOU LITTLE -- TELL GUY TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT. ALL I AM IS JUST A LITTLE BITCH ON THE BOAT. SO I GOT TO TAKE IT. HE'S KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT JUST LIKE HE SHOULD. OKAY, NOW GET BACK UP THERE AND DO SOMETHING. [ LAUGHS ] HE'S TRYING. I'LL TAKE THE [BLEEP] ALL DAY LONG. I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SPOT ON THIS BOAT COME OPEN SEASON. [ BEEP ] Narrator: GREENHORN LYNN MAY BE LAGGING BEHIND, BUT HIS COUNTERPART, MOI, IS WORN OUT AND WANDERING AIMLESSLY. MOI'S STILL RUNNING AROUND IN [BLEEP] CIRCLES WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF. MOI! YOU JUST GOT TO KIND OF FOCUS A LITTLE BIT FOR ME, OKAY? THE GUYS ARE JUST RUNNING ME RAGGED. I THINK THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO BREAK ME RIGHT NOW TO SEE IF I'M GONNA GO DOWN. I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM. RIGHT NOW, MOI'S FRUSTRATED. HE CAME OUT HERE EXPECTING TO STEP ON THE DECK AND BE A SUPERSTAR, AND THAT'S NOT REALITY. REALITY IS THAT YOU COME OUT HERE, YOU START BUSTING YOUR ASS RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE, YOU'RE GETTING YELLED AT, YOU'RE BEHIND, YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE JOB RIGHT. YOU KNOW, IT JUST DOESN'T COME EASY. WHOO-HOO! Narrator: IF MOI'S WORK ETHIC DOESN'T CHANGE, HIS FIRST SEASON ON THE BERING SEA COULD BE HIS LAST. COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH," THE BERING SEA GIVES UP HER GOLD... MONEY CRAB, BABY! MONEY CRAB! Narrator: ... AND SWALLOWS AN OLD BUCKET OF BOLTS. HE'S GONNA [BLEEP] HIS PANTS WHEN HE PULLS THE TRUCK UP. I KNOW THAT. Narrator: 225 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, TIME BANDIT CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND BREAKS FROM HUNTING CRAB TO STALK A NEW PREY LOOMING ON THE HORIZON. YEAH, I THINK WE GOT HER IN OUR SIGHTS. Narrator: SO FAR, THE PICKUP PRANK FOR CAPTAIN PHIL HAS BACKFIRED. BACK IN DUTCH HARBOR, WHAT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA... [ LAUGHTER ] HAS BEEN A CONSTANT PAIN IN THE BUTT FOR THE TIME BANDIT BOYS. GEEZ! DOING THIS TRUCK THING, I SMASHED MY FINGER, AND I WHIPPED MYSELF IN THE NOSE WITH THAT BIG 2-INCH HOUSING. NOW, WITH ONE DEVILISH STROKE, THE CREW CAN FINALLY DITCH THE RUSTY WRECK AND PUNK CAPTAIN PHIL. THAT FORD IS GONNA SLAM INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE CORNELIA MARIE. [ LAUGHS ] OH, IT HAS BEGUN. OKAY, POT NUMBER 710. I THINK I SEE IT UP HERE. [ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] GAME ON. Narrator: THE PLAN IS DEVIOUSLY SIMPLE. PULL PHIL'S POT, AND REPLACE IT WITH A PRE-OWNED PIECE OF JUNK. A NICE FORD COMING AT YOU. GET IT THE HELL AWAY. Scott: WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN DOING IT. Narrator: WITH PHIL'S BUOYS ATTACHED, THE DECK CAN NOW BE RELIEVED OF ITS 17-FOOT, 3,000-POUND NUISANCE. [ LAUGHS ] VERY READY TO GET RID OF IT, SO WE DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH IT ANYMORE. IT'LL BE  CORNELIA MARIE'S PROBLEM. HE'S GONNA [BLEEP] HIS PANTS WHEN HE PULLS THE TRUCK UP. I KNOW THAT. Man: ABOUT THERE? AS SOON AS YOU GUYS ARE READY. YOU GUYS READY? NO. YEAH, BABY! [ LAUGHS ] MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. I'M GONNA KIND OF MISS OLD SQUASH. THAT'S WHAT I KIND OF NICKNAMED MY LITTLE GIRL -- SQUASH. IT'S A GOOD OLD TRUCK. I HATE TO SEE HER GO. [ JOHNATHAN LAUGHS ] Narrator: FISHING 350 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE RED KING CRAB GROUNDS IS THE 108-FOOT EARLY DAWN. AFTER GROSSING NEARLY 2 MILLION BUCKS, CAPTAIN RICK FEHST NEARS THE END OF A 97-DAY BROWN KING CRAB MARATHON. WE'RE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE HERE AT REACHING OUR QUOTA. I'M GONNA TRY TO DO IT IN RECORD TIME. I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. I WANT TO GET THIS TRIP OVER WITH SO WE CAN SWITCH OVER TO RED KING CRAB AND MOVE ON. Fish: YEAH, THIS IS AWESOME. WE'RE JUST NAILING THEM. IT'S BEEN A GREAT SEASON. LOTS OF CRAB OUT THERE. Narrator: BROWNS ARE THREE-QUARTERS THE SIZE OF REDS, HAVING A TOUGHER, SPINIER EXOSKELETON, AND THEY'RE FISHED IN DEPTHS OF UP TO 3,500 FEET. Fehst: THEY LIVE ON STEEP CLIFFS, MOUNTAINS, HILLS, VALLEYS, ROCK PILES. Narrator: TO CATCH BROWN CRABS IN THE DEEP TERRAIN, RICK USES A DIFFERENT YET EQUALLY DANGEROUS PROCESS CALLED LONG MINING. BROWN CRAB BOATS DROP ONE MASSIVE STRING WITH POTS ATTACHED AT 400-FOOT INTERVALS. EACH STRING CAN CONTAIN UPWARDS OF 100 POTS. THERE'S A LOT OF RISK OUT HERE FOR THESE GUYS ON DECK. Narrator: THE MOST DANGEROUS PART -- DODGING THE BITE. YOU'RE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LINE. YOU'RE IN BETWEEN A POT AND THE LINE. YOU'RE IN THE BITE. YOU'RE IN A BAD SITUATION, YOU KNOW? WE CAN'T CUT THE LINE, TURN AROUND, AND GET YOU IN TIME. THAT'S WHY WE ALL PACK A KNIFE. START CUTTING. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE. Yager: PAT IS IN THE BITE NOW, SO IF ANYTHING WAS CAUGHT UP HERE, HE WOULD GO FOR A RIDE. SEE HOW THAT WORKS? THAT'S NOT GOOD. FOR YOU GREENHORNS OUT THERE, DON'T DO IT LIKE THAT. Narrator: THE NONSTOP FAST AND FURIOUS PACE CREATES DANGER ZONES ALL OVER THE BOAT. WHEN BROWNS ARE HAULED, THE LONG LINE RUNS THROUGH THE BLOCK, ACROSS THE BACK OF THE WHEELHOUSE, DOWN THE PORT SIDE, TO THE LINE BIN AT THE AFT OF THE BOAT. IN FULL OPERATION, THE DECK TRANSFORMS INTO A GAUNTLET OF FLYING TANGLES OF LINE... ...AND BONE-CRUSHING STEEL. A LOT OF BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN. ANOTHER SPOT -- DON'T RUN UNDER THE LINE. THIS -- YOU TAKE A GUY OUT. Narrator: ANOTHER OBSTACLE -- FLYING SEA LINKS -- 2-POUND STEEL HOOKS USED TO CONNECT THE POTS TO THE LONG LINE -- WHIP ACROSS THE DECK. FLYING SEA LINKS. YOU GOT THE SEA LINKS ATTACHED TO A BRIDLE ALSO ON THE POT. YOU COME UP, THE TWO GROUPS SLIDE TOGETHER LIKE THIS. BUT A DECK FULL OF DEATH TRAPS IS WELL WORTH THE RISK. YOU GOT AN $800 POT. ONE POT. TAKES YOU ONE MINUTE TO HAUL $800 WORTH OF CRAB. BROWN CRAB'S AN AWESOME FISHERY. MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, M-M-MONEY! Narrator: COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... A GREENHORN STEPS OVER THE LINE... Mezich: THEY'VE BEEN FISHING FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE BEEN FISHING FOR ONE. THEY CAN DO SOMETHING FASTER. THAT'S JUST AMAZING! AND THE CORNELIA MARIE DRAGS UP A SURPRISE FROM THE DEEP. Phil: HOLY! IS THAT A CAR? Narrator: 260 MILES SOUTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, CAPTAIN RICK FEHST OF THE EARLY DAWN HAULS THE SECOND TO THE LAST STRING THROUGH THE BLOCK. FIRST POT'S UP. WHAT DO WE GOT? OH, THIS SUCKS! FIRST POT -- NOT TOO IMPRESSIVE. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? NOT A VERY GOOD SIGN. THREE CRABS. THEY MUST HAVE TOOK OFF ON US. Narrator: BAD FISHING MEANS MORE TIME AWAY FROM THE HIGHLY LUCRATIVE RED KING GROUNDS -- A DELAY RICK CAN'T AFFORD. Fehst: I'M TRYING TO WRAP IT UP. MY PARTNER BOAT -- HE STARTED RED CRAB ON TIME. MAKES ME JEALOUS. [ LAUGHS ] I SHOULD BE THERE WITH HIM RIGHT NOW. Narrator: NOT ONLY IS RICK PRESSURED TO CATCH CRAB, HE ALSO HAS TO KEEP A WATCHFUL EYE ON THE BOAT OWNER'S SON -- SECOND YEAR GREENHORN BRYAN MEZICH. BROWN KING CRAB. Narrator: LAST YEAR, FISHING THE BERING SEA WAS POOR TORMENT FOR BRYAN, AND HIS CREW DIDN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER. WE GOT BUTTERBALL OVER HERE TRYING TO PUSH ON THE DOOR. HE'S GOT THE POWER OF NESTLé QUIK, POTATO CHIPS, AND JELLY DOUGHNUTS. OF COURSE, HE COILED THIS BLANKET OF BULL [BLEEP] THIS IS A HORN COIL IF I'VE EVER SEEN ONE. WOULD I LIKE TO PUT MY FOOT UP HIS [BLEEP] SURE. HE'S BEEN A LITTLE HARDER THAN MOST BECAUSE IT GOES IN ONE EAR AND OUT THE OTHER, SO TO SPEAK. Narrator: BRYAN MAY BE THE SAME COCKSURE KID HE WAS LAST YEAR... THEY'VE BEEN FISHING FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE BEEN FISHING FOR ONE. THEY CAN DO SOMETHING FASTER. THAT'S JUST AMAZING! BUT THE YEAR OF FISHING AND AN IMPROVED WORK ETHIC HAS IMPRESSED THE SALTIER CREW. HE HAS DEFINITELY, GRADUALLY STARTED TO LIKE FISHING AND PARTICIPATING MORE. I THINK HE'S GOT POTENTIAL. Narrator: AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING. BEAUTIFUL CRABS. Mezich: LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THESE THINGS. WHOO! COME ON! GIVE ME SOME LOVE! MORE LOVE! MORE LOVE! HE'S GOOD KID, BUT HE STILL GOT SOME LEARNING. BUT HE'S TRYING HARDER AND HARDER EVERY DAY. WE WON'T TELL HIM THAT, THOUGH. HIS HEAD WILL GET TOO BIG. [ GROWLS ] [ CHUCKLES ] FISHING 490 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST IS THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE. SO FAR THIS SEASON, FISHING HAS BEEN A TOTAL BUST FOR CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS. Phil: UNBELIEVABLE. THERE WAS THREE CRABS IN THAT LAST ONE. Narrator: NOW, PHIL APPROACHES THE LAST POT IN HIS BAD-LUCK STRING. Phil: THIS IS THE LAST POT IN THE STRING COMING UP. MAYBE IT'S GOT CRAB IN IT. WE'RE HOOKED UP ON -- THE BUOY SUNK OR SOMETHING. WE'RE PULLING UP OUR POT AND ANOTHER ONE. Millman: SUPER TIGHT RIGHT NOW. DOESN'T WANT TO PULL. Phil: HOLY [BLEEP] IS THAT A CAR? YEAH! THAT'S A CAR? WHAT THE HELL? AN F-250. GOOD LORD. WOW, MAN. I NEVER CAUGHT A TRUCK BEFORE. [ LAUGHS ] WOW. THAT WAS WAY UNEXPECTED. WELL, OUR LAST POT IN THIS STRING IS A FULL-SIZED TRUCK. [ LAUGHS ] OH, MAN. Millman: THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT TO PULL. WELL, NOW I KNOW WE CAN PULL A TRUCK WITH THE BLOCK. Phil: [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, BABY! IS THERE ANY CRAB IN IT? YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: A NOTE FROM THE TIME BANDIT TIPS OFF THE CORNELIA MARIE CREW. THAT IS A GOOD ONE. THAT BEATS MY PIPE TENFOLD THERE. I GOT TO GIVE HIM AN "A" FOR THAT ONE. THE HILLSTRAND BROTHERS, YOU KNOW? THE HILLSTRANDS ARE SOME DIRTY PLAYERS, MAN. LET'S GET RID OF IT. AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO SAVE THAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITH IT. LET HER RIP. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH," GREENHORNS BREAK DOWN... I JUST DON'T KNOW. ...AND THE NORTHWESTERN GETS BURNED. THAT'S WHAT'S KICKING OUR ASS RIGHT NOW. THIS COULD BE A PAINFUL STRING, MAN. Narrator: 250 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 155-FOOT WIZARD. HEY, IS THAT THE NUMBER 167 OR IS THAT -- THAT'S 68, RIGHT? Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN DROPPED HIS ENTIRE STACK THROUGH THE STORM, NOW HE'S HAULING AND STACKING ANOTHER 150 POTS FROM STORAGE. AS SOON AS WE SEE SOME CRAB -- SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO SET ON, WE'LL DEFINITELY BE GETTING THIS GEAR OFF. LeVeen: WE'RE STACKING THE LAST OF OUR 150 HERE. TO FIND OUT WHERE THE CRAB ARE AND DROP ALL THESE ON TOP OF THEM. WE'VE GOT THE GREENHORNS BATING THE POTS WHEN THEY'RE COMING ON. THAT'S GONNA SAVE US A LOT OF TIME WHEN WE'RE GETTING THEM BACK OFF. YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO GET THEM OFF AS FAST AS YOU CAN. Narrator: BAITING THE POTS MIGHT SAVE TIME LATER, BUT RIGHT NOW, IT ONLY MEANS ONE THING FOR THE GREENHORNS -- MORE WORK. Guitard: RIGHT NOW, I AM CUTTING UP SOME COD SO WE CAN KEEP UP WITH THE BAIT, YOU KNOW? THAT'S MY DUTY AS GREENHORN. SHOULDER'S A LITTLE -- A LITTLE TENDER, I GUESS, FROM JUMPING IN AND OUT OF THOSE POTS, BUT IT'S NOTHING TOO BAD. I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY HOURS I'VE BEEN WORKING, BUT I'M FINE RIGHT NOW, AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN GO FOR ANOTHER 12 HOURS. Narrator: AS LYNN GETS A SECOND WIND, HIS COUNTERPART, MOI, LOOKS FOR A PLACE TO CRASH. I'M COLD, GETTING SWEATY, SOAKING WET, TIRED AS HELL. DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOBS AND COME DO THIS. IT'LL BE [BLEEP] HOURS, MAN, I TELL YOU WHAT. I'M BARELY HOLDING ON AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW. Narrator: WITH MOI AT HIS BREAKING POINT, CAPTAIN KEITH HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL HIM OFF DECK. HEY, JASON. YOU'RE DOWN. QUITE FRANKLY, MOI NEEDS A LITTLE EXTRA REST RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT FIRST 30 HOURS WITH ONLY FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP WAS A RUDE AWAKENING TO WHAT THE BERING SEA IS LIKE. MY HANDS HURT. MY BACK HURTS. MY SHOULDERS HURT. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING HURTS. I COULD GET ABOUT SIX HOURS OF SLEEP NOW AND A MEAL. HOPEFULLY FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER AFTER THAT. I-I... I JUST DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHS ] Keith: THE BERING SEA, IT'S A WAR OF ATTRITION, AND A LOT OF GUYS DON'T SURVIVE. WE'LL SEE. WE DEFINITELY HAVE MORE THING TO KEEP AN EYE ON OUT HERE NOW. THAT'S FOR SURE. Narrator: 150 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST, NORTHWESTERN CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN APPROACHES HIS FIRST POTS OF THE SEASON. WE'RE OUT ON OUR SOUTHERN GEAR -- THE FIRST LOAD WE SET. THIS IS THE SOUTHERNMOST STRING. WE DO HAVE A LOT SOAKED ON THE GEAR. THINKING POSITIVE, I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT. Narrator: LATE OUT OF THE GATES DUE TO A DAMAGED PROP, SIG GAMBLED AND BROKE FROM THE FLEET, PLOTTING A COURSE FOR FAMILY GROUNDS THAT HADN'T BEEN FISHED IN OVER 40 YEARS, A GAMBLE EDGAR HOPES PAYS OFF IN SPADES. RETIREMENT. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE TO SEE IN THIS FIRST POT. RETIREMENT. 150. NO, 40's GOOD. 40, 50. THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. WE'LL GET, WHAT, 40 IN THE FIRST POT? SURE. I HOPE SO. DON'T WANT TO STACK THE FIRST STRING. OKAY, FIRST POT OF THE SEASON COMING UP. WHOA! THAT IS NOT GOOD! WE'RE IN A DESERT. THAT MAKES IT EASY TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO, DON'T IT? TO MOST GUYS, IT'S JUST JUNK AND PAPER, BUT, TO ME, IT'S A GOLD MINE. I THINK A LOT OF GUYS ARE GONNA JUMP RIGHT OVER CRAB, AND I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO GO AND FOLLOW A BUNCH OF SHEEP. WE'VE HAD SEASONS DOWN THERE IN THE PAST WHERE WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL. Narrator: A GAMBLE THAT ISN'T PAYING OFF. IT WAS FOUR ALTOGETHER. I THREW ONE OVER. THAT WAS IT. YOU KNOW, THE FEW CRAB THAT ARE IN THERE, IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH RUNNING THE HYDRAULICS TO MOVE THE TABLE. JUST DUMP -- DUMP THE THREE WE'RE GETTING ON DECK AND PICK THEM UP. Narrator: AS IF THE POOR FISHING WASN'T PAINFUL ENOUGH, THE POTS ARE DRAPED WITH A NASTY BYCATCH. THIS IS JELLYFISH SLIME. THIS IS THE STUFF OFF OF TAILS. AND IT BURNS. IT BURNS WORSE THAN ACID DOES. LOT OF JELLYFISH ON THE END OF THAT LINE, THEY WERE TALKING. LOT OF SLIME. THIS IS GONNA BE A PAINFUL STRING, MAN. MY FACE IS BURNING -- NOT SO MUCH IN HERE, BUT RIGHT HERE. NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT CATCHING CRAB, I GOT TO GET SLAPPED BY JELLYFISH, TOO. THIS IS WERE ALL THE BROWN STUFF STEMS FROM RIGHT THERE. THEY GOT THESE LITTLE TAILS THAT STICK OUT. THEY'RE USUALLY ABOUT THIS LONG. THAT'S WHAT'S KICKING OUR ASS RIGHT NOW. THE LAST 10 POTS, WE CAUGHT ABOUT AS MUCH CRAB AS WE WOULD IN ABOUT ONE POT. THAT'S NOT GONNA MAKE OUR SEASON. WE NEED A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT TO MAKE OUR SEASON. AFTER STACKING ALL OF HIS 150 MISFIRED POTS, IT'S TIME FOR A NEW PLAN. RIGHT NOW, IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE UP NORTH. WE'RE ON A MISSION. WE WANT TO GET THESE MOVED, WE WANT TO TRY TO GET THEM UP THE HILL, AND SEE IF WE CAN'T GET ON SOME STEADIER FISHING. WE NEED SOMETHING. Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... [ LAUGHTER ] AY CARAMBA! ...A BROWN CRAB BONANZA... AND A KING CRAB WASTELAND. ONES AND TWOS AND ZEROES. I WAS HOPING FOR MORE. Narrator: 260 MILES SOUTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE EARLY DAWN IS WRAPPING UP HER BROWN CRAB SEASON. THIS COULD BE THE LAST STRING OF THE 2007 BROWN CRAB. WE GOT ABOUT 600 MORE CRAB TO PUT IN THE TANK, AND WE'LL BE CAPPING THEM OFF AND RAILING THE REST AND GETTING READY TO HEAD TO DUTCH AND START RED CRABBING. BROWN CRAB '07 COMING TO AN END! WHOO! YEAH! Narrator: AFTER 20 SOLID POTS, CAPTAIN RICK COMES DOWN TO GIVE THE BOYS THE GOOD NEWS. NO MORE CRAB. NO MORE CRAB. NO MORE CRAB. Fish: IT'S GOOD TO KNOW WE GOT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO. EXTREMELY RELIEVED. Man: YEAH? YEAH. I'LL EVEN BE MORE RELIEVED IN THE END OF RED SEASON. Narrator: BY RICK'S ESTIMATE, THE EARLY DAWN HAS REACHED HER QUOTA. TO AVOID A FINE, THE REST OF THE CRAB IN THIS STRING ARE DUMPED BACK IN THE WATER. Fehst: THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR. WE'LL BE BACK. THE SAME CRAB THAT WE'RE DUMPING OUT THE BACK RIGHT NOW WILL BE HERE NEXT YEAR. TO ALL THOSE KEEPERS GOING OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT, YOU GOT SO DAMN LUCKY. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: WITH THEIR GRUELING BROWN KING CRAB SEASON NOW OVER, THE CREW STACKS THE GEAR WHILE RICK HEADS TO DUTCH TO WEIGH IN AND CASH OUT. THE EARLY DAWN CAUGHT 784,000 POUNDS OF BROWN CRAB WORTH $1.9 MILLION -- $90,000 FOR EACH MEMBER OF THE CREW. NOW IT'S TIME FOR ALASKAN RED KING CRAB. IN CALM WATERS 500 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN OF THE TIME BANDIT PREPARES TO HAUL HIS FIRST POT OF THE SEASON. ALL RIGHT, NOW WE CAN FINALLY GO CRABBING, GO TO WORK, AND GET THIS OVER WITH. WE'VE DONE ALL THE SILLY STUFF WE NEED TO DO. YEP, FIRST ONE OF THE SEASON. WE GOT ABOUT 11 HOURS OR SO. 11 HOURS OR SO, KIND OF. WE NEED 25, 30 CRAB IN IT, THEN WE'LL BE HAPPY CAMPERS. Narrator: FISHING WITH ONLY HALF AS MUCH GEAR AS THE NORTHWESTERN,  CORNELIA MARIE, AND WIZARD, JOHNATHAN HOPES HE SLAMMED HIS POTS ON THE MOTHER LODE. WE GOT TO GET IN THE BOW MASS, SOME GOOD CRAB AND STAY IN IT. 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA GRIND ON 20 AVERAGE. WE'RE NOT THE GRINDERS. THESE GUYS, WITH THEIR 400 POUNDS, 250 POUNDS COULD STAY OUT HERE AND GRIND. Narrator: FOR SCOTTY HILLSTRAND, THIS STRING WILL BE HIS FIRST TEST AS A TIME BANDIT FISHERMAN. I DON'T SEE NOTHING -- NOT VERY MANY. EIGHT CRAB. EIGHT. WAS HOPING FOR MORE. BETTER THAN ONES AND TWOS AND ZEROES. DAMN IT! IT'S NOT LOOKING SO GOOD. LOOKS PRETTY BAD. AH. USUALLY THE BIOMASS IS A LOT CLOSER TO DUTCH, BUT NO ONE'S BEEN SEEING ANYTHING, SO WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY NORTHEAST AND EAST. THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO. WE'LL PROBABLY HIT THE BIOMASS. THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF CRAB OUT HERE YET. WE HAVEN'T FOUND THEM YET. A LONG WAYS TO GO. A LOT OF NIGHTS. A LOT OF GRINDING BAIT. A LOT OF HAULING. A LOT OF SETTING. A LOT OF STACKING. AT LEAST WE'RE WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS WE ALL GET A LONG WITH. IT'LL MAKE THAT MUCH EASIER TO GET THROUGH IT. Narrator: AS DESOLATE GROUNDS SOURS JOHNATHAN'S SPIRITS, A CALL FROM THE RECENTLY PUNKED CAPTAIN PHIL COMES OVER THE RADIO. [ RADIO BEEPING ] HEY, JOHN. I HAVE TO GIVE YOU AN A-PLUS ON THAT ONE. THAT WAS GOOD. I THINK MY CREW ABOUT [BLEEP] [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. THANKS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, MAN. IT WASN'T LIKE AN ECONOMY RIG, EITHER. IT WAS A FULL-MEAL DEAL. [ LAUGHS ] THAT WAS GOOD. I GIVE YOU AN A-PLUS  ON THAT ONE, MAN. NEVER IN ALL MY YEARS SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I WAS PARKED NEXT TO THAT TRUCK FOR JUST A LITTLE TOO LONG, AND I WENT, "WAIT A MINUTE, I GOT A FLATBED. HERE'S A FORKLIFT. THERE'S A TRUCK. I GOT A BOAT SITTING THERE AT THE DOCK. EUREKA!" I'LL HAVE TO RETURN THE FAVOR, BUT I THINK I'LL BE THINKING FOR A LONG TIME TO COME UP WITH ONE BETTER THAN THAT. OVER. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TOP THAT'S AN AIRPLANE. [ LAUGHS ] YEP. THAT'S RIGHT. OR A HELICOPTER. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THE CRAB COUNT. WHILE THE EARLY DAWN HAULS IN THE REST OF HER BROWN CRAB QUOTA, THE TIME BANDIT IS AT THE TOP OF THE LEADERBOARD WITH THE FIRST KING CRAB OF THIS SEASON. Narrator: 220 MILES TO THE NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTHWESTERN JOGS IN CALM SEAS. CAPTAIN SIG'S GAMBLE TO FISH HIS FATHER'S GROUNDS DIDN'T PAY OFF. [ SPEAKING NORWEGIAN ] Narrator: BUT FOR ONCE, THE EVER-SECOND-GUESSING SKIPPER STICKS WITH HIS GUT AND ROLLS THE DICE ONCE MORE WITH HIS DAD'S CHARTS. Sig: IF I LOOK AT THAT CHART, I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MILE THAT HASN'T BEEN COVERED BY THIS BOAT, AND IT JUST REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING THAT MY DAD FISHED AT BEFORE WHEN I FIRST GOT ON HERE. WHEN WE WERE TEENAGERS, WE FISHED UP, AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS COMPASS ROSE, WHICH IS RIGHT HERE. THAT'S THAT HOLE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. I'M GONNA GO GIVE THAT A TRY. SIG SETS A COURSE FOR MORE FAMILY GROUNDS. BUT TO INSURE THE NEXT SET PAYS OFF... HEY, ED! Narrator: SIG ORDERS EDGAR TO OWN UP TO THE BOAT'S FORGOTTEN NORWEGIAN RITUAL. BITE SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT. THIS ONE'S FOR GOOD LUCK. HERE WE GO. [ GAGS ] [ COUGHS ] [ GAGGING ] [ LAUGHS ] FUNNY. HEY, THAT'S NOT EVEN A BITE! COME ON, BE AN ANIMAL. Man: YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! SHOW SOME LOVE FOR YOUR BOAT. [ LAUGHS ] I LOVE MY BOAT. COME ON. YEAH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD SEASON. THAT BETTER HELP US CATCH CRAB. IF IT DOESN'T, IT'LL MAKE A GOOD SANDWICH. Narrator: WITH THE BAIT BITING IN THE BOOKS, THE MEN OF THE NORTHWESTERN HOPE THAT GOING OLD-SCHOOL WILL TURN THEIR HARD-LUCK SEASON AROUND. 150 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, THE WIZARD STEAMS TOWARDS ITS FIRST STRING OF PROSPECT POTS. AFTER GETTING A FOUR-HOUR BREAK FROM CAPTAIN KEITH, GREENHORN JASON MOILANEN IS CALLED BACK TO DUTY. THAT WAS GREAT. I NEEDED IT BAD. I'M BACK UP FOR MY NEXT 18-HOUR STINT. LET'S DO IT. HE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET, BUT HE WORKED -- THAT LAST SHIFT THAT HE WORKED, THE ONE THAT HE STARTED TO FALL APART ON, IS ABOUT HALF OF WHAT HE'S GONNA BE GOING THROUGH HERE IN THE COURSE OF THE SEASON IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. LITTLE BABY BRUISE. NOTHING BIG. THIS IS PROBABLY FROM SLAMMING INTO THE CRAB POT ONCE OR TWICE BAITING THEM UP. I'M PRETTY MUCH COVERED HEAD TO TOE RIGHT NOW WITH THEM. I CAN'T FEEL A THING. BODY'S NUMB. BUT I'M GONNA JUST KEEP MOVING. Narrator: KEITH TOOK A GAMBLE BY SETTING HIS POTS ON THE NORTHERN TIP OF THE CRAB GROUNDS. WITH THE REST OF THE FLEET HEADED HIS WAY, KEITH HOPES THESE POTS ARE ON THE CRAB. Monte: YEAH! WHOO! UP TO THE NORTHERN END OF OUR LITTLE PLANET, AND IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD FOR ABOUT AN 18-HOUR SOAK HERE. WE FOUND CRAB. 42. Keith: 4-2? ROGER. BROUGHT A SMILE TO MY FACE TO SEE MY FIRST COUPLE POTS OF CRAB. NEVER GOT TO SEE THAT BEFORE. AND...JUST KEEP GOING WITH IT. THIS IS WHERE THE MONEY STARTS GETTING MADE. AFTER JUST ABOUT FALLING APART AFTER THAT SECOND SHIFT, TO WALK OUT ON DECK AND ALL OF A SUDDEN -- BOOM! IF THAT DOESN'T GET YOUR SPIRITS UP, THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BERING SEA THAT WILL. JUST CHECKING ANOTHER POT, AND IT'S STILL LOOKING GOOD. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH. DO YOU SEE SUCCULENT, GLORIOUS KING CRAB? Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH WANTS TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AT HIS CRAB, SO HE HEADS DOWN TO THE SORTING TABLE. LOOKING GOOD! GOOD! YES! IT'S LOOKING GOOD! I'M HAPPY, MAN. YES, I AM! IT'S DEFINITELY A BIG SHOT OF ADRENALINE WHEN YOU'RE PULLING UP YOUR PROSPECT HERE AND YOU'RE SEEING 50, 57, 50. 68! Keith: 68! OH, YEAH! SO, NOW WE'RE GONNA SLAP OFF EVERYTHING WE GOT ON THIS BOAT. WE NEED TO GET OUR GEAR ON IT WHILE IT'S HERE. 'CAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT BE HERE TOMORROW. THEY MIGHT NOT BE HERE THE NEXT DAY, SO. ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALL GOING OFF IN ONE STRING. Narrator: AS THEY BEGIN TO CARPET BOMB THE GROUNDS, THE PRE-STAGED BAIT GIVES GREENHORN MOI A CHANCE TO HONE HIS SKILLS. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS THINGS THAT WE DO IS WHEN WE'RE SETTING GEAR, OKAY? THIS IS WHERE YOU GET JERKED OVER THE SIDE. BASICALLY, I'M GONNA GET MYSELF OVER, I'M GONNA BACK OUT OF THE WAY, AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GONNA WING YOUR STUFF OVER. AS YOU MOVE TO THE RAIL, WATCH YOUR FEET. KEEP YOUR FEET ON THE DECK, OKAY? YOU WATCH ME, I'LL WATCH YOU, AND WE'LL BOTH TAKE OUR MONEY TO THE BANK, ALL RIGHT? I'M READY. I'M READY FOR THIS. HOLD ON NOW. Keith: MOI, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S OUT THERE WORKING. I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S RUNNING AROUND JUST COMPLETELY INEPT OR ANYTHING. I MEAN, HE'S GETTING THE JOB DONE. HE'S JUST GOT TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH IT ONE SHIFT AT A TIME IS ALL. AND GET HIS BODY BUILT UP AND ACTUALLY BEAT DOWN A FEW MUSCLES AND BUILD A FEW OTHER ONES UP, AND HE'LL BE FINE. DEFINITELY NOT AN EASY JOB. IT'LL WEAR ON YOU, AND IT'S ONLY THE FIRST DAY OR TWO OR -- DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS. Narrator: EACH BUOY BAG SETUP WEIGHS 14 POUNDS. WITH 135 POTS TO GO, MOI WILL SPEND THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS LIFTING AND HURLING MORE THAN A TON OF WEIGHT. ONLY TIME WILL TELL IF GREENHORN MOI HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE IT ON THE BERING SEA. NEXT TIME ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... THAT'S STARTING TO BLOW. ANOTHER BRUTAL ARCTIC STORM SLAMS INTO THE FLEET. YOU GET INTO THIS KIND OF WEATHER, THIS IS WHEN YOU START HAVING GUYS -- YOU KNOW, YOU GET IN TROUBLE. HEY! 15. 24. 8. WHAT? Narrator: CARELESS CRAB COUNTS HAVE SKIPPERS READY TO ERUPT. Sig: HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING? I WANT THE CRAB COUNT, AND I WANT IT NOW! Narrator: AND GREENHORNS LEARN MORE PAINFUL LESSONS... OW! DON'T KILL IT! DON'T KILL IT! KEEP WORKING! Narrator: ...ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO HUNT DOWN THE DEADLIEST CATCH. WHOO! YEAH, BABY!
