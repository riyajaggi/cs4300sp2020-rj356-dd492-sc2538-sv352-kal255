 AH [BLEEP] [ LAUGHS ] OH, I WAS READY YESTERDAY TO GET OUT OF HERE. VITAMIN "C" -- COFFEE. THIS IS MY ORANGE JUICE. LET'S GO, MAVAR. LET'S DO THIS [BLEEP] LET'S DO IT. HE'S GETTING GOOFY. HAPPENS EVERY TIME. THIS IS THE FARTHEST NORTH STRING WE HAVE. WE'VE GOT 25 POTS. THAT GOES FOR 4 MILES THERE, SO WE'LL SEE HOW IT DOES. Narrator: AFTER NEARLY A MONTH AT SEA, 4 MILES AND A COUPLE OF DOZEN POTS ARE ALL THAT STAND BETWEEN THE BONE-WEARY CREW AND THEIR BUNKS. [ WHISTLING ] OH, YEAH. THANK GOD. Sig: WOW! WHERE'S THE TABLE AT? THAT'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR. HOLY CRABS -- ANOTHER FULL POT. THIS THING'S CONSISTENT. Narrator: CAPTAIN SIG HAS DIALED IN ON A MASSIVE VEIN OF GOOD, CLEAN CRAB. THE CELEBRATION IS SHORT-LIVED. Sig: WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT? [BLEEP] DAMN. Narrator: SIG'S WORST NIGHTMARE HAS COME TRUE. THE LEAD EDGE OF THE 250,000-SQUARE-MILE ARCTIC ICE PACK IS SLOWLY SWALLOWING HIS GEAR. Sig: IT'S THE FIRST SIGN THAT WE'VE SEEN. SO THERE WAS AN ICE FLOE COMING DOWN. THIS IS A REAL THIN LAYER, IT LOOKS LIKE, BUT THAT'S USUALLY THE BEGINNING. Edgar: [ Groaning ] OHH! OH [BLEEP] THAT'S NOT NICE. OH [BLEEP] BLOCKED OUT OF IT. Narrator: NOW SIG'S MISSION -- SALVAGE $25,000 WORTH OF GEAR. YOU HAVE TO FORCE YOUR WAY UP, AND THEN YOU GOT TO HOLD YOUR POSITION, THEN YOU WAIT FOR THE DAMN THING TO POP UP. THEN YOU GOT TO GO IN AND GET IT, IF YOU CAN GET IT. IT IS A CRAB FISHERMAN'S NIGHTMARE. THERE'S NOT ONE DAMN THING THAT'S GOOD ABOUT SEEING THAT. ALL IT DOES IS KILL YOUR POTS, MAKES IT COLDER. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF STUFF. IT JUST MEANS THAT THE BIG STUFF ISN'T TOO FAR BEHIND IT. Narrator: SIG'S GPS PLOTTER INDICATES THE POT SHOULD BE DIRECTLY OFF TO HIS STARBOARD... ...BUT THERE'S NOT A BUOY IN SIGHT. [BLEEP] SIG FINALLY SPOTS THE BUOYS, TUCKED AWAY IN THE ICE, 3 MILES FROM THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION. Edgar: ALL RIGHT, JUNIOR, YOUR FIRST ICE POT. YEAH. YEAH, CAUSE THAT'S EXCITING HERE. Narrator: NOW JAKE MUST THREAD THE NEEDLE TO AVOID HOOKING THE ICE WITH HIS TOSS. WE'RE GONNA POP HIS ICE CHERRY. WHOO-HOO! NICE SHOOTING, MacGYVER. THE ABOMINABLE GREENHORN. THAT'S IT. [BLEEP] AIN'T COMING OUT. [ LAUGHS ] PULL LIKE A BULL. I HATE THIS [BLEEP] CAN'T STAND THE ICE. [ THUD ] WHOA! GEEZ! WHOO-HOO! YEAH, BOY. MAKES EVERYTHING A [BLEEP] [ BEEPS ] ANOTHER ONE IN THE ICE HERE. PULL, PULL, PULL, PULL! Narrator: MATT'S SECOND TOSS NOT ONLY SNAGS THE BUOY, BUT IT ALSO CATCHES A PIECE OF ICE THE SIZE OF A SMALL CAR. THATABOY! ALTHOUGH SIG'S ON HUGE NUMBERS, HE'S NOT ABOUT TO COMPROMISE HIS GEAR TO THE ICE. HE MAKES PLANS TO MOVE SOUTH, OUT OF HARM'S WAY. Sig:  WE'RE GONNA STACK IT. WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE  ON SETTING BACK. EVEN ON THESE NUMBERS, I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. Narrator: 272 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE. I'M [BLEEP] Narrator: ALTHOUGH THE CORNELIA MARIE'S TANKS ARE STUFFED WITH 312,000 POUNDS OF OPILIO CRAB, 2 MILES OF HARD-PACKED ICE STANDS BETWEEN CAPTAIN PHIL AND ST. PAUL HARBOR. ST. PAUL HARBOR MASTER,  CORNELIA MARIE. YEAH. YEAH, IT'S THICK. WE'RE JUST GETTING INTO IT NOW. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GO INTO THE HARBOR RIGHT NOW. OTHERWISE, WE'RE GONNA BE DRIFTING AROUND OUT HERE FOR ANOTHER DAY. WE'RE GONNA GET STUCK WITH THIS CRAB, NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT OFF, AND THEN WHAT DO I DO? Narrator: OVER $750,000 WORTH OF CRAB HAVE BEEN SITTING IN THE TANKS FOR 11 DAYS. NOW WITH THE CRAB PUSHING THE LIMIT OF HOW LONG THEY CAN SURVIVE AND NO SIGNS OF THE ICE PACK MELTING, CAPTAIN PHIL ENGAGES HIS TWIN 1,800-HORSEPOWER ENGINES AND BEGINS BREAKING THROUGH THE ICE -- NEARLY 4 FEET THICK. ALTHOUGH THE 199-TON VESSEL IS BARELY MAKING A KNOT, PHIL'S TWIN ENGINES ARE RIDING DANGEROUSLY IN THE RED. WOW. I'VE GOT 1,800 HORSEPOWER, AND I'M AT 1,200 RIGHT NOW. Narrator: BUT THE SKIPPER HAS COMMITTED, WILLING TO RISK HIS ENGINES TO SAVE HIS CATCH. YOU CAN WALK AS FAST AS WE'RE GOING. THIS IS DANGEROUS. Narrator: AS THE CORNELIA MARIE INCHES CLOSER, THE ICE IS GETTING THICKER. PHIL LEANS ON THE THROTTLE, PUSHING HIS ENGINES TO THE LIMIT. Phil: THIS IS JUST LIKE BEING IN THICK CONCRETE, MAN. I MEAN, I'M RUNNING LITERALLY NOW AT 1,350. Narrator: THE SLOW PUSH THROUGH TONS OF ICE ISN'T GOOD FOR THE BOAT OR CAPTAIN PHIL'S HEART. NO, IT'S NOT. I'M REALLY KIND OF GETTING CONCERNED IN THE HARBOR HERE IF WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE DOCK. Narrator: PHIL IS STILL OVER A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE DOCK. THE ICE IS SEVERAL FEET THICK, FORCING HIM TO PUSH THE ENGINES EVEN HARDER. [ ALARM BLARING ] GOD. HERE WE GO AGAIN. SOMEBODY GO GET IT. WE JUST BLEW A MAIN. [ ALARM CONTINUES ] [BLEEP] OH, MY GOD. Narrator: AS ENGINEER STEVE WARD INVESTIGATES, OIL STARTS SPEWING FROM ONE OF THE ENGINES. SOMETHING LET GO. THE [BLEEP] OIL'S POURING OUT THE DIPSTICK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WE NEED OIL OR SOMETHING. WE NEED OIL. WE GOT WATER IN THE OIL. WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. OIL'S JUST PUMPING OUT THE DIPSTICK. I HAD TO SHOVE IT BACK IN THERE AND HOLD IT IN. WELL, HOLD IT IN. LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET TO THE DOCK. Narrator: ONE OF PHIL'S TWO MAIN ENGINES HAS BLOWN UP. NOT WANTING TO RISK MORE DAMAGE, PHIL DISENGAGES HIS PORT ENGINE, RELYING SOLELY ON WHAT'S LEFT OF HIS STARBOARD. WITH ONLY ONE ENGINE, CAPTAIN PHIL SLOWLY MUSCLES HIS WAY INTO THE DOCK. TIGHTEN IT, JAKE. TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT! Narrator: AFTER TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING THROUGH A MILE OF ICE, PHIL FINALLY TIES UP AT THE DOCK. BUT HE STILL HAS HIS GEAR SOAKING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE MAIN ICE PACK AND NOW NO WAY TO GET BACK TO IT. MY GEAR IS OUT WHERE THE ICE IS GONNA TAKE IT IF I DON'T GET THIS BOAT GOING. I'M AT THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS. I'M SCREWED. I'M IN DEEP TROUBLE HERE. Narrator: HOPES OF FIXING THE CRIPPLED BOAT AND SALVAGING THE SEASON HINGES ON PHIL CONVINCING A MECHANIC TO FLY IN FROM DUTCH HARBOR -- 270 MILES AWAY. I GOT $100,000 WORTH OF CRAB POTS THAT ARE GONNA GET ATE IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING HERE. I'M JUST [BLEEP] RAZOR BLADES RIGHT NOW. I'M CRITICAL THIS TIME. THIS IS THE WORST YOU'VE EVER SEEN ME. I'VE GOT TO GET THIS THING GOING. NOW I GOT TWO CIGARETTES GOING AT ONCE. WHAT A MESS. WE GOT A [BLEEP] MESS. Narrator: 227 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, WELL SOUTH OF THE REST OF THE FLEET, IS THE 155-FOOT WIZARD. GIVE ME A SECOND HERE, GUYS. I'M JUST TRYING TO FORMULATE A PLAN. Narrator: 21 DAYS INTO THE SEASON, CAPTAIN KEITH HAS ZERO CRAB DELIVERED. NOW WITH HIS SECOND STRING WORKING ON DECK, THE WIZARD APPROACHES THEIR FIRST PROSPECT POTS. Keith:  ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THIS IS IT -- FIRST POT OF THE YEAR. KNOCK ON WOOD.  LET'S GET GOING. IT'S KIND OF CREEPY HAULING THIS FIRST POT WITHOUT MONTE OR SOPER DOWN ON THAT DECK. CATCH SOME CRAB, BABY! AH, YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO START LIKE THAT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? QUITE FRANKLY, I'M JUST GLAD WE'RE STARTING. A WEEK AGO, I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN WE'D FISH AGAIN. HELL, A WEEK AGO, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IF I HAD A CREW LEFT. Narrator: THE MEN OF THE WIZARD ARE A DIFFERENT CREW THAN SET SAIL SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. THE GIANT WAVE THAT BATTERED THE WIZARD... Keith: WATCH OUT!  HANG ON! HANG ON! Narrator: ...IS STILL FRESH IN THE MINDS OF THE CAPTAIN AND HIS CREW. THREE MEMBERS OF KEITH'S CREW WERE BADLY INJURED, INCLUDING HIS BROTHER MONTE. Keith: RIGHT NOW GARY'S DOWN. WE'RE ALREADY ROTATING, SO HE'S IN THE RACK, AND, UH... WELL, MONTE'S KIND OF ROTATING RIGHT NOW, TOO. I'M GUESSING HE'S PROBABLY IN THE RACK, TOO. HE'S JUST 3,000 MILES FROM HERE. COME ON. GIVE ME SOMETHING TO GO ON HERE. JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO GET STARTED WITH. FIRST POT, LENNY! WHOA! YEAH! YES! ALL RIGHT! NOW WE'RE TALKING. SWEET! THAT'S MORE LIKE IT! JUST USE YOUR WEIGHT, OKAY,  AND IT'LL COME RIGHT AROUND. RETRACTING! 2-8-0. I'M NOT GONNA BE PICKY. A 280 COUNT FOR A FIRST POT IS NOT BAD. Narrator: THE WIZARD IS BACK IN BUSINESS -- NOTHING SPECTACULAR, BUT THEY'RE FISHING AGAIN. IS THAT A FRESH ONE? 4-2-5. ALL RIGHT! THAT'LL WORK! IT'S NOT BAD, BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR MORE. BOTTOM LINE IS THEY'RE GOING IN THE HOLE. BOTTOM LINE IS WE'RE FRIGGIN' FISHING NOW. YEAH. Narrator: NINE POTS INTO THE STRING... [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] ...A CALL COMES IN TO THE WHEELHOUSE. HELLO? WHOA! THAT WAS A "CRAB-ALANCHE." WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. CAME OVER TO WHERE WE FISHED LAST YEAR, SLAMMED THEM OUT. I'M JUST GETTING STARTED, SO, I MEAN, I STILL HAVE A LOT OF GEAR TO LOOK AT. 5-0-0. MOUSE, I'VE HAULED 10 POTS. [ LAUGHTER ] GIVE ME A BREAK, MAN! [ Laughing ] WHEN AM I GONNA BE IN? HOW ARE THE RIBS RIGHT NOW? You know, I'm still having a real hard time. NO, I'LL BET. HEY, JUST STAY AS DOCILE AS POSSIBLE SO YOU CAN GET THOSE RIBS STARTING TO HEAL UP, OKAY, MONTE? TALK TO YOU LATER, MOUSE. BYE. AS MUCH I BITCH, COMPLAIN, AND SCREAM AT THAT GUY, I SURE DO MISS HIM. Narrator: ST. PAUL, ALASKA -- THE ENTIRE HARBOR IS CHOKED WITH ICE. TRAPPED AT THE DOCK WITH A BROKEN ENGINE IS THE CORNELIA MARIE AND CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS. THIS ISN'T FAIR. I MEAN, LOOK AROUND. THE REALITY OF IT IS, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT BIG ICEBERG. AND I'M STUCK. I CAN'T MOVE. I HAVE A BROKEN BOAT. I MEAN, WE COULD BE HERE FOR A MONTH. Narrator: AFTER MAKING THE LAST FLIGHT IN FROM DUTCH HARBOR, PHIL'S BOAT MECHANIC HAS SPENT THE MORNING TEARING APART THE ENGINE... I'M [BLEEP] Narrator: ...BUT HE'S FAR FROM A DIAGNOSIS. 371 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 100-FOOT INCENTIVE. I JUST CALLED THE WEATHER SERVICE THERE IN KODIAK THERE. IT'S GONNA START PICKING UP BIG-TIME. WE'RE GONNA GET UP TO ABOUT 50-KNOT WINDS AND 20-FOOT SEAS HERE. Narrator: THE INCENTIVE GOT OFF TO A SLOW START. NOW CAPTAIN HARRY NEEDS TO PACK 10,000 POUNDS OF CRAB ON BOARD... RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO HAUL TILL WE FALL. Narrator: ...BAD WEATHER OR NOT. Man: FIRST STRING. THIS BETTER BE A GOOD DAY FOR US. WE NEED THIS DAY. Lewis: IT'S SHOWTIME. [ HARMONICA PLAYS SEA SHANTY ] [BLEEP] OH, YEAH, GET THEM GOING -- HOT AND HEAVY. THAT IS NOT GOOD. IT'S A BUFFET FOR A [BLEEP] PARTY OF SIX, YOU KNOW? OH, THIS IS PATHETIC. Narrator: CAPTAIN HARRY'S NUMBERS AREN'T PICKING UP... ...BUT THE WEATHER IS. [ MAN LAUGHS ] FISHING SUCKS. WEATHER SUCKS. Lewis: ONE THING I GOT TO GUARANTEE IS THAT I DON'T TAKE EVERYBODY OUT ON DECK, GET EVERYBODY HURT. I GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE. IF WE DON'T GET OUR ACTS TOGETHER HERE IN THE NEXT TIME THROUGH THE GEAR, THEN WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT DELIVERY DATE. Narrator: AS NIGHT FALLS, 70-KNOT WINDS AND 40-FOOT SEAS THROTTLE THE FISHING GROUNDS. Man: WHAT A BEAUTIFUL EVENING. Narrator: THE NUMBERS ARE IMPROVING SLIGHTLY, BUT IT'S A FIGHT FOR EVERY CRAB. WE NEED TO GET SOME [BLEEP] GOING HERE. WE GOT A LOT OF CRAB TO CATCH, AND THIS JUST AIN'T CUTTING IT. WE ARE DEFINITELY BUCKING INTO IT. Man: OUT OF THE BLOCK! OUT OF THE BLOCK. Narrator: WHILE HAULING THE POT, THE LINE POPS OUT OF THE BLOCK AND SNAPS DOUG'S HAND WITH THE FORCE OF A BULLWHIP. [ GROANING ] THAT'S GONNA LEAVE A MARK. IF YOU'RE IN THE WRONG SPOT, IT CAN SNAP YOU AND BREAK YOUR ARM. IT COULD... THAT ONE HURT... REAL BAD. Lewis: ALL THAT WEIGHT ON THAT LINE SNAPS LIKE A GUITAR STRING. IT PROBABLY WOULD'VE KILLED A NORMAL GUY, BUT DOUG, HE'S LIKE AN OLD JUNKYARD DOG. IT DON'T FAZE HIM. Narrator: 150 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, FROZEN AT THE DOCKS IN ST. PAUL HARBOR IS THE CORNELIA MARIE. AFTER CRANKING ON PHIL'S ENGINE FOR 11 HOURS, THE MECHANIC HAS FINALLY FOUND THE PROBLEM. Man: NUMBER SIX CYLINDER IS SCORED SEVERELY. SOMETHING ELSE IS GONNA BLOW UP ALONG THE LINE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? IF WE CAN MANAGE TO GET THE PISTONS OUT OF THESE AND ON -- I KNOW, BUT THE THING I'M GETTING AT IS, I KEEP DOING WORK AND HAVING YOU TEAR INTO THE MOTOR, AND THEN TWO MONTHS LATER, YOU'RE DOING THE SAME [BLEEP] THING. I UNDERSTAND, PHIL. ...AND HAVING YOU GUYS COME BACK, YOU KNOW, TWO MONTHS LATER AND SAY, "AW [BLEEP] WE SHOULD'VE DONE THIS." WHY THE [BLEEP] DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE? AND I DON'T LIKE GOING THROUGH THESE MAYDAYS. IT'S BAD ON MY HEART. YESTERDAY, I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA HAVE A [BLEEP] HEART ATTACK. I DON'T LIKE TO GET INTO THAT [BLEEP] NO MORE. MY TRACK RECORD AIN'T THE GREATEST IN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHATEVER YOU WANT. Narrator: AND WITH THAT... PHIL'S OUT OF POCKET AN ADDITIONAL $67,000. Narrator: 327 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST IS THE 155-FOOT WIZARD. THAT'S ABOUT THE SAFEST SPOT IN THE BERING SEA DOWN HERE TO FISH. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A SPOT WHERE THE ICE DOES NOT COME. THIS IS ONLY 12 HOURS FROM TOWN. IF THERE'S HOT FISHING HERE, I CAN PROBABLY STUFF THIS BOAT AND BE BACK IN TOWN IN FIVE DAYS. THAT IS A FULL POT OF CRAB! WHOO! HEY, WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO TO GET THROUGH THE SEASON. WE GOT A LOT OF THESE TO GO THROUGH. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. HA HA! WHOO! Narrator: THE VETERANS ARE BACK IN THE SADDLE... TEA TIME. Narrator: ...BUT THE GREENHORNS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP PACE. WHERE ARE THE [BLEEP] AT? I DON'T KNOW. FOR THE MOST, THEY KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT EVERY SECOND. AND IF THEY DON'T, THEN THEY'RE YELLING, "WHERE THE [BLEEP] ARE THE KIDS AT?" WHERE YOU AT? HEY! FASTER! Warner: I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA BE A MAID AND THEN HAVE TO EAT [BLEEP] TOO. JOSH JUST GETS BUTT HURT EASILY. NOW, DO YOU KNOW THE WHOLE SAYING, "IT'S THAT TIME OF THE MONTH"? IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT TIME OF THE DAY WITH JOSH. I'M [BLEEP] TAKING A BREATHER. THAT'S WHAT I'M [BLEEP] DOING. Man: JOSH! HEY, JOSH. WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS THAT? [ LAUGHS ] WHAT THE [BLEEP] JOSH CAME IN FOR A BIG SHOVE AND WENT LIKE THAT [LAUGHS] AND DIDN'T ACTUALLY PUSH ANYTHING. Narrator: JOSH WALKS OFF THE DECK, LEAVING HIS CREWMATES ONE MAN SHORT FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE REST OF THE CREW CONTINUES CATCHING CRAB... ...WHILE JOSH CATCHES A CATNAP. YEAH. THERE ARE TWO CARDINAL SINS ABOARD A CRAB BOAT. ONE IS WALKING OFF THE DECK. THE OTHER IS WALKING INTO THE WHEELHOUSE WITH A GRIPE. I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE HEADS UP THAT I'M THINKING THAT THIS IS GONNA BE MY ONLY TRIP. THE LAST GREENHORN TO STEP UP ON CAPTAIN KEITH IS NOT FISHING CRAB ANYMORE. MOI, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT NOW -- GET OUT OF MY [BLEEP] WHEELHOUSE NOW! IS THERE A REASON? I GET HUMILIATED, EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT BE IN, LIKE, A LITTLE BIT OF A JOKING MANNER OR WHATEVER, LIKE, BEING CALLED A LITTLE GIRL. WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND -- I'LL BE HONEST, SO FAR YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A FREE PASS. THE GUYS HAVEN'T GOT DOWN ON YOU. AND TRUST ME -- THAT'S NOT A GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSE. IF YOU DO THIS, YOU'RE GONNA BE WALKING AWAY FROM A LOT OF MONEY. WE HAD A PRETTY TRAUMATIC EVENT ON THIS BOAT WHEN WE TOOK THAT WAVE. IS THAT PART OF YOUR DECISION, AS WELL? MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE SURE I KEEP YOU GUYS SAFE. AND THERE'S A HUGE MEASURE OF TRUST WHEN YOU WALK OUT ON THAT DECK WITH A GUY UP HERE. GIVE YOURSELF A DAY OR TWO. YOU'VE GOT POTENTIAL. LET'S NOT SQUANDER IT, OKAY? YEAH. ALL RIGHT? Keith: I DON'T KNOW. I HATE TO SEE THE KID LEAVE, BUT THE FIRST YEAR'S ALWAYS THE HARDEST. THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY. Narrator: 61 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST IS THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. Sig: THIS MORNING, I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY. TIRED. Narrator: FOR CAPTAIN SIG AND CREW, IT'S BEEN A BRUTAL 79-HOUR FISHING SHIFT. [ SIGHS ] AFTER RESCUING ALL OF HIS POTS FROM THE ICE... IT IS A CRAB FISHERMAN'S NIGHTMARE. Narrator: ...SIG MOVES SOUTH AND SETS HIS GEAR ON NEW, UNTESTED GROUNDS. WE WORKED A LITTLE LATER LAST NIGHT TO GET THE GEAR. NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S STILL AROUND. Narrator: NOW CAPTAIN SIG HAULS ON A 30-HOUR SOAK. Edgar: YEAH! WHOO-HOO! Man: OH, YEAH! Man #2: YEAH! OH, YEAH. THESE LOOK GOOD. WHOO-HOO! HOLY MOTHER! YEAH! YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ON DECK, THE NUMBERS ARE GOOD... ...BUT IN THE WHEELHOUSE, THE SKIPPER IS IN TROUBLE. [BLEEP] IT'S, LIKE, SUPER TIGHT. [BLEEP] WHOO-HOO! [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] THAT WAS [BLEEP] WEIRD, DUDE. I COULDN'T SWALLOW. [ WHEEZES ] [BLEEP] [ COUGHS ] Edgar: YEAH! Narrator: MINUTES PASS... [ LAUGHTER ] ...BUT SIG REFUSES TO ALERT HIS CREW. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] [BLEEP] ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] THAT WAS, MAN. IT WAS, LIKE, A REALLY ACUTE, SHARP PAIN RIGHT THROUGH MY RIBS, ALL THE WAY ON EACH SIDE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST REALLY PAINFUL. IT HAD TO BE SOME KIND OF A CRAMP OR SOMETHING. BUT IF IT WAS A CRAMP, WHY WOULD IT SPREAD SO EVENLY, LIKE, YOU KNOW, STRAIGHT DOWN AND THEN STRAIGHT ACROSS THE WHOLE WAY? OH, ANYWAY... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS. I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. [ COUGHS ] STOP CRYING ABOUT IT. Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH IS TRYING TO CATCH UP TO THE REST OF THE FLEET. Narrator: THIS IS FROZEN ST. PAUL HARBOR. AND THIS IS THE CORNELIA MARIE. CRIPPLED WITH A BROKEN ENGINE, SHE'S BEEN TRAPPED HERE IN THIS FROZEN PRISON FOR FIVE DAYS. Phil: WE'VE BEEN HERE WAY TOO LONG. IT'S TIME TO GO. [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: FINALLY, WITH THE CYLINDERS FIXED, THE MECHANIC BREATHES LIFE INTO PHIL'S ENGINE. WITH THE WEATHER WINDOW OPENING, IT'S NOW OR NEVER. Jake: HEY, APPRECIATE IT, BUDDY. Narrator: PHIL NEEDS TO RETRIEVE $100,000 WORTH OF HIS GEAR BEFORE THE MAIN ICE PACK SWALLOWS IT WHOLE. RIGHT NOW I'M JUST FOCUSED ON GETTING THE BOAT OUT OF HERE. Narrator: BUT TO DO THAT, HE'LL HAVE TO RISK A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR BOAT AND THE LIVES OF HIS CREW JUST TO GET OUT OF ST. PAUL. IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT TWO MINUTES, THEN WE'RE GONNA LEAVE. COME UP IN THE WHEELHOUSE. I'LL TELL YOU. HERE'S THE DEAL -- I'M GONNA TRY TO SPRING OUT OF HERE. USE THE FORWARD CLEAT SO THAT MY BOW DOESN'T GET INTO THE ROCKS UP THERE. RIGHT. MY GEAR IS OUT WHERE THE ICE IS GONNA TAKE IT IF I DON'T GET THIS BOAT GOING... ...SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A SHOT. IF I CAN GET US AROUND FAR ENOUGH TO BACK OUT OF HERE, THAT'S GREAT. IT IS BLOWING LIKE A [BLEEP] OUT HERE. Narrator: PHIL WASTES NO TIME TESTING HIS NEWLY REBUILT ENGINE. THE ICE IS NEARLY A FOOT THICKER THAN IT WAS WHEN HE BLEW THE MAIN JUST FIVE DAYS AGO. AH, IT FEELS GOOD TO HEAR THE ENGINES PURRING. Ward: IT'S BLOWING OUT, MAN. Phil: WELL, I'M GONNA BE PUSHING AGAINST ALL THIS ICE AND ALL THIS WIND. I WOULD BE CONCERNED JUST WITH THE WIND, LET ALONE THE ICE. Jake: UH-OH. JACOB, GET SOME BAGS IN THERE. YEAH. HEY! BAGS, JAKE, BAGS! WOW, WE'RE DOING A LOT OF RATTLING. IF I CAN JUST GET THE STERN AROUND. KIND OF NERVE-RACKING. [ CREAKING ] OH [BLEEP] THAT HAD TO BE A CHUNK OF [BLEEP] ICE. THAT'S NOT GOOD. YOU KNOW, WE'RE HITTING CHUNKS OF ICE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY PUNCH A HOLE IN OUR BOAT AND SINK US. I'M SURE THE OLD MAN'S FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW. Phil: I CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE DOING THIS. Narrator: TO BREAK AWAY, ONCE AGAIN, THE SKIPPER PUSHES HIS TWIN 900-HORSEPOWER ENGINES TOWARD THE RED. BUT I'M ALMOST TURNED AROUND. I THINK I CAN GET ALL THE WAY AROUND. [ ENGINE WHIRS ] WE'RE AWAY FROM THE DOCK AND TURNED AROUND NOW. THAT'S A GOOD THING. YES. WE'RE OUT OF HERE. [ LAUGHS ] WE OFFICIALLY MADE IT OUT OF THE ICE IN ST. PAUL HARBOR. WE'RE OUT IN OPEN WATER, THANK GOODNESS. IT JUST FEELS GOOD TO BE OUT OF THE ICE. Narrator: NOW, FREE FROM THE ICE, PHIL SETS A COURSE TO HIS NORTHERN STRINGS. WE'RE ABOUT 90 MILES FROM OUR CRAB POTS. AS LONG AS I HAVE SOMETHING TO PICK UP, BUT IF I LOSE THEM POTS UP THERE, WE'RE JUST SCREWED. Narrator: THE CORNELIA MARIE CHARGES FULL STEAM AHEAD ON A RESCUE MISSION TO SALVAGE $100,000 WORTH OF GEAR FROM THE ICE. ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH"... Man: HA HA! YEAH! HA HA HA! Narrator: THE OPILIO SEASON HAS REACHED THE HALFWAY MARK. WE ARE KICKING ASS! Narrator: THE FLEET IS LOCKED IN BATTLE WITH AN ANGRY BERING SEA... Sig: IF IT'S NOT THE ICE, IT'S THE WEATHER. IT'S A SLAP IN THE FACE OR A KICK IN THE BUTT. Narrator: ...AS THE HUNT CONTINUES FOR THE DEADLIEST CATCH. NO GUTS, NO GLORY, BROTHER!
