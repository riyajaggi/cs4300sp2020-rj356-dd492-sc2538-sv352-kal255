 THE MEN ARE BACK... AND READY. WE'RE HEADED OUT FOR THE 2008 OPILIO SEASON. I'M THINKING ABOUT ALL THE CRAB I NEED TO CATCH. OPIES IS MY FORTE. I'LL GO UP AND I'LL NAIL THE [ BLEEP ] OUT OF THESE CRAB. Narrator: ON THE CORNELIA MARIE, CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS FINISHES AN EXPENSIVE OVERHAUL OF HIS MAIN ENGINE... YEAH, THAT WAS AN EXPENSIVE FIX.

 Narrator: WITH HIS ENGINES ROARING, PHIL'S SLATE IS WIPED CLEAN, AND IT'S BACK TO BUSINESS. THAT'S MY JOB, IS TO MAKE [ BLEEP ] HAPPEN. Narrator: DOWN ON DECK, THE HARRIS BOYS ARE BUSY... WELL, JUST BEING BROTHERS. WHY DON'T YOU JUST COUNT IT? WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH YOU COUNTING? BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO BE ACCURATE COUNTING. WELL, IF YOU SECOND-GUESS ME SO MUCH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST COUNT THE [ BLEEP ] POTS? IT TAKES FIVE MINUTES OUT OF YOUR DAY. I WANT YOU TO BE ACCURATE. FIVE [ BLEEP ] MINUTES OUT OF YOUR DAY. JOSH, I'M GOING TO PULL THE BOSS CARD THIS TIME AND TELL YOU YOU NEED TO BE THE BOSS CARD? MORE [ BLEEP ] ACCURATE ON THE COUNT. YOU'RE NOT MY BOSS. THE ONLY BOSS ON THIS BOAT IS DAD. THAT'S MY BOSS. ALL'S I'M SAYING IS, BE ACCURATE ON YOUR COUNT. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE ABOUT IT. IT'S REAL EASY. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE... AS YOUR BOSS, BE ACCURATE ON THE COUNT. I'M TELLING YOU AS YOUR BOSS. YOU'RE NOT MY BOSS. I AM. YOU CAN GO ASK DAD IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S... WELL, LET'S CALL DAD UP ON THE PHONE, AND LET'S ASK HIM. [ LAUGHS ] LET'S CALL HIM. HEY, SO JAKE'S TELLING ME THAT HE IS MY BOSS. HE SAYS, "COME ON, I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THIS." Narrator: ACROSS THE DOCKS, THE MIGHTY NORTHWESTERN WARRIORS ARE BACK. AND WHILE THEY MAY BE TOUGH ENOUGH FOR THE BERING SEA... THEY'RE NO MATCH FOR THE FLU. Sig: EVERYBODY'S SICK ON THE BOAT, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WANT TO GO TO BED, I DON'T FEEL GOOD. I HAD FLU ALL COD SEASON. NOW I'M GOING TO GO CRAB FISHING WITH THIS CRAP. I'M SICK OF IT. Narrator: BUT THE FLU BUG HASN'T BITTEN GREENHORN JAKE ANDERSON. GRINDING THROUGH KING SEASON HAS EARNED HIM ANOTHER STRIPE AND MORE CONFIDENCE ON DECK. Anderson: I'M GOING TO BE OUT THERE ON THAT RAIL. DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M HURT, DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M CRYING, DOESN'T MATTER IF SOMEBODY PUNCHES ME, I'LL STILL BE OUT THERE WORKING, AND THEY KNOW THAT NOW. Narrator: ON THE TIME BANDIT, THE HILLSTRAND BROTHERS ARE BACK, BUT THERE'S A TRADITIONAL CHANGING OF THE GUARD FOR OPIES. JOHNATHAN IS RELINQUISHING THE HELM TO HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, ANDY. Andy: WE'RE PRETTY PUMPED. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CRAB TO CATCH. JUST TRYING TO GET THE SEASON GOING. GOT TO GET THE FIRST TRIP UNDERNEATH OUR BELT. Narrator: AND AFTER A CHANGE OF HEART, THE HEIR APPARENT, SCOTTY HILLSTRAND, RETURNS TO FACE THE ICE AND SNOW. ONLY PLACE I LIKE MY ICE IS IN MY COCKTAILS. John: JACKASS! JACKASS! YEAH, THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE I WANT TO SEE [ BLEEP ] ICE. Narrator: BUT WITH AN IMPENDING STORM FRONT AND DELIVERY DEADLINES ONLY A WEEK AWAY, CAPTAINS RACE TO FINISH PREPARATIONS AND SET SAIL. Man: RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS. HURRICANE-FORCE WIND  WARNING TONIGHT. HURRICANE, BABY! THERE'S A HURRICANE A-COMIN'. Man: SEAS 22 FEET. GALE WARNING THROUGH TUESDAY. HEAVY FREEZING SPRAY  WARNING TODAY. Narrator: WITH JUST TWELVE HOURS BEFORE THE STORM HITS, ACROSS THE DOCKS, ON THE NORTH AMERICAN, CAPTAIN STEN SKAAR SOUNDS A NOTE OF CAUTION TO HIS NEW GREENHORN, DARRELL LABAY. WE'RE GOING TO DEPART DUTCH HARBOR TOMORROW, DEEBO, FOR YOUR FIRST MAIDEN VOYAGE OF THE BERING SEA. I'M A LITTLE SCARED. IT'S GOOD TO BE AFRAID. IF YOU WEREN'T AFRAID, THEN I'D BE CONCERNED. Narrator: STATISTICALLY, OPILIO SEASON DOUBLES THE MORTALITY RATE FOR EVERY FISHERMAN BRAVE OR FOOLISH ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE BERING SEA. AND FOR NORTH AMERICAN DECKHAND DAVIN NES, THIS TRUTH HAS HIT HOME ESPECIALLY HARD. TWO WEEKS EARLIER, HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, JEFFREY, WAS KILLED. Nes: I'M GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT JEFFREY THIS WHOLE SEASON. Narrator: WHILE WORKING AT DOCK, JEFFREY NES FELL TWO STORIES FROM THE TOP OF A STACK OF POTS. HATE TO SAY IT, BUT HE REALLY WASN'T BUILT FOR CRABBING. HE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT, ALWAYS WANTED TO... SHOW THAT HE COULD DO IT TO EVERYBODY. JEFF AND I WERE SO CLOSE, AND I'D JUST TALKED TO THE GUY... IT'S LIKE, "WHERE'D HE GO?" YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SO SAD THAT HE'S GONE. SAD DEAL. Sig: I THINK HE BROKE HIS NECK ON THE RAIL, BETWEEN THE RAIL AND THE DOCK. IN THE WATER, THEY GOT HIM BACK... NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE'S GONE. I MEAN, WE GREW UP TOGETHER. AND THAT'S JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. SO IT CAN HAPPEN RIGHT AT THE DOCK, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER, YOU KNOW, IS THIS GOING TO BE OUR TURN? WHEN YOU LOSE GOOD GUYS OUT HERE, IT KIND OF -- IT HITS HOME. Narrator: BACK AT THE WIZARD, CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN DRIVES THE POINT HOME. YOU GUYS, REAL FAST. I DON'T WANT TO START THIS SEASON ON A DOWN NOTE, BUT I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY MOI, WITH YOU CLIMBING UP ON THESE POTS, AND CROSBY OVER THERE, TOO -- A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, JEFF NES FELL OFF ONE OF THESE POTS, BROKE HIS NECK, TUMBLED OVER, HIT THE RAIL, IN THE WATER, GONE. SO IT HAPPENS THAT QUICK. SO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU'RE UP THERE, OKAY, MOI? Narrator: NOW, WITH JUST HOURS BEFORE A MAJOR ARCTIC STORM TEARS THROUGH DUTCH HARBOR... HEY, GUYS, WE GOT TO CUT LOOSE AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. THERE'S A STORM COMING. Narrator: THE FLEET MOVES OUT. SHOULD HAVE LEFT A DAY AGO. BUTTON EVERYTHING UP, GET READY FOR ROUGH WEATHER. 70-KNOT WINDS COMING. Narrator: THE PROMISE OF CRAB GOLD AWAITS THEM. THAT IS, IF THEY CAN BEAT THE WRATH OF WINTER ON THE BERING SEA. NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH" -- Sig: LET HER GO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. Narrator: THE FIRST POTS OF THE OPILIO SEASON SPLASH DOWN. AND LATER -- A WICKED WINTER STORM PUMMELS THE FLEET. THIS ONE'S GOT SOME TEETH. Narrator: BY DAY'S END, MOST OF THE FLEET HAS LEFT THE HARBOR. BUT FOR THE FEW STRAGGLERS, AN ARCTIC FRONT BEGINS TEARING THROUGH THE PORT. ON THE WIZARD, CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN NEEDS AN EXTRA 48,000 GALLONS OF FUEL BEFORE HE CAN LEAVE. Keith: WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET INTO THE FUEL DOCK HERE. BLOWING ABOUT 50, MAYBE 60. IT'S GUSTING TO 70 AT TIMES, AND SCREAMS RIGHT THROUGH HERE WHERE THE FUEL DOCK IS. Narrator: AND WITH HIGH WINDS BROAD-SIDING THE WIZARD, KEITH TAKES NO CHANCES AND WARNS THE CREW. Keith: IT'S BLOWING ABOUT 60 OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT A FOUR-HIGH STACK, AND THE BOAT IS GOING TO COME IN LIKE A BIG OLD KITE, JUST BLOWING US RIGHT IN, SO... I EXPECT THE "A" GAME ON THIS TIE-UP, ALL RIGHT? Keith: IT'S GOING TO BE NASTY GOING AROUND THE CORNER, SO MAKE SURE THE GUYS HAVE EVERYTHING BATTENED DOWN REAL GOOD UP THERE. TIE-OFF LINES ARE ALL SECURED  AND EVERYTHING, RIGHT? WE DON'T WANT  TO LOSE ANYTHING. IT'S THE FIRST DOCK I EVER TIED THIS BOAT UP AT, AND I HAD A REALLY, REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE. WIND STARTS BLOWING 50, 60, 70, TAPPING 100, YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION POSSIBLE, BECAUSE IT'S GUARANTEED, AS SOON AS I GET COMPLETELY COMMITTED IN HERE, THAT IT'S GOING TO TAP 100 AGAIN. YOU'LL DO THE STERN LINE. WE'LL GET ANOTHER STERN LINE TO HIS BOW ONCE WE GET IN THERE, BUT I NEED TO KNOW UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT HE'S NOT STICKING OUT ANY BIT AT ALL. BECAUSE IF HE IS, THEN WE CAN'T TIE UP. GET SOME FENDERS READY RIGHT IN HERE FOR HIS BOAT, OKAY? OKAY. Keith: THE WIND'S GOING TO BE  BLOWING ME A LITTLE BIT TOWARDS THE DOCK THERE  PERIODICALLY, SO WE MAY COME IN  A LITTLE BIT HOT, SO GET THOSE LINES OFF FAST  FOR ME, OKAY? WHAT DO I GOT, TRAVIS? Lofland: THREE-OH! 30 FEET. OH, YEAH, HERE IT COMES, EVERY [ BLEEP ] TIME YOU TRY AND TIE UP. WHAT DO I GOT, TRAVIS? TEN FEET, EIGHT FEET! REVERSE! OKAY, ROGER. JUST GOT TO SPRING WITH IT, TRAVIS, KEEP IT TIGHT. HEY, TRAVIS,  HOW MANY FEET WE GOT TO THE BARGE? FIVE, SO I'M GOOD  RIGHT WHERE I AM, RIGHT? OKAY, MAKE EVERYTHING SNUG,  GUYS. Narrator: NOW, SAFELY DOCKED, KEITH WILL HAVE TO PLAY CATCH-UP AS HE FILLS UP AND RACES OUT OF PORT. WELL, NEVER A DULL DAY IN DUTCH HARBOR. Narrator: 275 MILES NORTHWEST, AS THE NORTHWESTERN STEAMS A FEW HOURS AHEAD OF THE STORM FRONT, CAPTAIN SIG PREPARES TO SET ON FAMILY GROUNDS. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF STORMS COMING THROUGH THIS AREA IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER, AND WITH THESE FREEZING CONDITIONS, STORMS COMING IN, THE FARTHER YOU SPREAD YOURSELF OUT, THE HARDER IT IS TO PLAN AND GET BACK IN. Narrator: BUT BEFORE THEY SET, SIG'S GIVEN DECKHAND MATT BRADLEY THE HONORS OF THE NORWEGIAN BLESSING. Sig: TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE READY AND I'LL TURN AROUND. NO, WE'RE NOT READY. MATT'S GOT TO DO THIS FIRST. [ GROANING ] Edgar: JAKE COULD DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT. YOU'VE GOT TO CHEW IT. [ RETCHING ] YUCK! SWALLOW IT DOWN, MAN! Edgar: YEAH. I'M GOING TO PUKE. Edgar: YOU'RE GOING TO PUKE ANYWAY. YOU'RE ALREADY SEASICK. EAT IT. I'M NOT SEASICK. EAT IT. SICK OF BEING AT SEA WITH YOU. EAT IT! [ RETCHING ] [ LAUGHING ] GIVE ME THAT [ BLEEP ] THING! [ RETCHING ] [ LAUGHING ] [ RETCHING ] POINT IS HE TRIED. I GUESS. [ BRADLEY RETCHING ] AH, MATT'S EATING THE HERRING. THAT'S GOOD. WE DIDN'T NEED TO REMIND ANYBODY THIS TIME. OKAY, LET HER GO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. Edgar: ALL RIGHT, SLOW, THEN. GOING OVERBOARD. OPIES! 2008! ALL RIGHT. FIRST POT'S OFF THE BOAT, AND WE ARE UNDERWAY. Edgar: MAIN THING IS JUST TRYING NOT TO KILL ANYBODY DOWN ON DECK HERE WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO GET A POT IN THE RACK. SET IT, JUST GET IT READY TO SET. MATT'S FAMOUS LAST WORDS, "GOOD ENOUGH." TWO-ONE-THREE. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TIMING. Narrator: BY NIGHTFALL, THE NORTHWESTERN COLLIDES WITH THE STORM FRONT, AND WITH A FORECAST OF HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS, SIG RACES TO GET THE LAST 40 POTS OFF THE DECK. Sig: WELL, WE'VE GOT OUR LAST STRING WE NEED TO SET HERE, AND TO BE QUITE HONEST, I DON'T CARE WHERE IT ENDS UP. JUST WANT TO GET IT OFF THE DECK. Edgar: YOU HAVE TO GRAB THAT ONE! OKAY, THAT WAS CLOSE. AH, LOOKS LIKE THE WEATHER PICKED UP A LITTLE. WE HAVE 45! Narrator: JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT, JAKE THROWS THE LAST BUOY BAG OVER THE RAIL. ALL 150 POTS ARE NOW FISHING. I'M GOING TO SEEK SHELTER AND LET MY POTS AND MY BAIT DO THE WORK, AND IF THIS 40, 45 STARTS KICKING UP LIKE IT'S DOING, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'LL JUST DUCK OUT OF THE WAY AND LET HER GET SOAKED. Narrator: COMING UP NEXT -- WHOA. 200,000 POUNDS OF STEEL IN 40-FOOT SEAS. THIS IS THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE OF THE BERING SEA. Narrator: AS THE STORM TORE THROUGH THE GROUNDS, THE FLEET WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT TO DROP THEIR POTS. NOW, AFTER AN EIGHT-HOUR SOAK, TIME BANDIT CAPTAIN ANDY HILLSTRAND APPROACHES HIS FIRST TEST POT OF THE SEASON. Andy: WOKE UP, AND WE GOT STORM WARNINGS ALL THE WAY UP THE CHAIN. SOUTHEAST 60. WOO! OH, YEAH, WE'RE ALREADY IN 15-, 20-FOOTERS. HANG ON. IF YOU WERE SURFING... WE ARE SURFING. ON A 114-FOOT SURFBOARD. Newberry: THIS IS THE OPILIO I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. Long: AH, THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. BAD LUCK IF YOU MISS THE FIRST ONE OF THE SEASON. WELL, LA-DI-FREAKING-DA. GOD, IT GOT ROUGH FAST. THIS IS COOL STUFF. DON'T WANT TO WAIT. NO GOOD. Narrator: AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF SOAKING, THE ONLY THING THE BAIT CAUGHT WAS MORE BAIT. ONE COD, 13 CRAB. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DAYS LIKE THIS, SO YOU'RE LIKE THE OTHER DAYS TOP THIS. POO-POO. LAST YEAR, WE WERE PULLING LIKE... 800, 900. Narrator: NOW ANDY WILL HAVE TO STACK ON ALL OF HIS POTS, DESPITE THE GROWING STORM. Andy: DEFINITELY 25-FOOTERS RIGHT NOW. IT'S FIVE FOOT HIGHER THAN MY BOW. DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU GO, YOU GET WET. I'M TAKING WAVES UP TO THE WHEELHOUSE WINDOWS RIGHT NOW. SO THAT WOULD BE A 30-FOOTER. WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT. IF A GUY FELL OVERBOARD IN 25-FOOT SEAS, YOU'D PROBABLY NEVER SEE HIM. EVEN WITH THE FLOATATION COAT ON. Narrator: 140 MILES TO THE SOUTH, THE WIZARD'S BEEN SLOWLY DRIVING THROUGH THE STORM SINCE THEY LEFT LATE OUT OF THE GATE. CAPTAIN KEITH HAS ANOTHER 125 MILES TO GO BEFORE HE REACHES THE GROUNDS. WHOA. YEAH... OH, MY GOD! THEY'RE GETTING BIGGER BY THE MINUTE. Narrator: BANKING ON A RECORD OPILIO CATCH, KEITH MAXED OUT WITH OVER 200,000 POUNDS OF STEEL STACKED TWO STORIES HIGH ON DECK. ONE OF THE LARGEST VESSELS IN THE FLEET, THE WIZARD IS RATED TO HANDLE 250 POTS, BUT KEITH QUESTIONS HIS STABILITY REPORT AS HE BEGINS TAKING 35-FOOTERS OVER THE BOW. Keith: THE WEATHER MAN MISSED IN A BIG WAY. IF WE GET TO A POINT WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE START MAKING FREEZING SPRAY IN THIS NORTHWESTERLY, YOU KNOW, THAT HAYSTACK IS GOING TO FREEZE UP LIKE A BIG CUBE OF ICE REAL QUICK, AND THAT COULD CAUSE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS FOR THE STABILITY OF THE VESSEL. Narrator: ON THE BERING SEA, THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE POSITION A CAPTAIN CAN BE IN. FREEZING SPRAY, 40-FOOT SEAS... THIS ONE'S GOT SOME TEETH. Narrator: AND A FULL STACK. WITHIN MINUTES, 40-FOOT WAVES BEGIN COLLIDING WITH THE WIZARD FROM EVERY DIRECTION. DEEP UNDERWATER, A SINGLE MASSIVE CURRENT MOVES COUNTERCLOCKWISE. WHEN IT HITS THE CONTINENTAL SHELF, IT SPLINTERS INTO MULTIPLE SMALLER CURRENTS THAT RISE AND CREATE A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS "CONFUSED SEAS." FOR KEITH, GETTING THE POTS OFF THE BOAT IS HIS FIRST PRIORITY, BUT THE WIZARD IS CURRENTLY RIDING WATERS 900 FEET DEEP OFF THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE ALEUTIAN BASIN. IF KEITH DROPS THE GEAR, HE'LL LOSE HIS POTS AND HAVE TO RETURN TO DUTCH. AFTER FIVE HOURS, KEITH FINALLY REACHES THE EDGE OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF. HE ORDERS THE CREW TO DROP THE FIRST TWO LAYERS OF POTS. GO AHEAD AND GET READY. COMING UP! WE'RE FINALLY FISHING. THIS IS THE LAST ONE, AND ONE MORE! Narrator: 320 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST, TIME BANDIT CAPTAIN ANDY HILLSTRAND HAS PULLED TWO OF HIS THREE TEST STRINGS, AND HAS ONE LEFT TO HAUL. Andy: WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRIANGLE WHERE THREE OF OUR FRIENDS HAVE DIED. THREE CREW MEMBERS FALLEN OVERBOARD. BUT ALL OF OUR GUYS THAT WE'VE KNOWN THAT HAVE DIED OVER THE YEARS CRAB FISHING, EVERYBODY USUALLY DIES IN THIS LITTLE CHUNK OF WATERS HERE. I MEAN, 30 GUYS HAVE DIED RIGHT HERE IN THIS 30-MILE AREA. Narrator: EVEN WITH THE 35-FOOT SEAS, ANDY DECIDES TO STACK THE GEAR AND HUNT DOWN NEW GROUNDS SOUTH OF THE STORM. Andy: WE'RE GOING  TO PULL A FEW MORE AND THEN GO SATIN. ONE MORE. Andy: I'M GOING TO JUMP DOWN  THE STRING A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW. Narrator: BUT AS ANDY GOES DOWN THE LINE, THE NUMBERS IN THE POTS BEGIN TO RISE. 260. THERE YOU GO. YEAH, BABY. THOSE ARE [ BLEEP ] AWESOME POTS, AREN'T THEY? THAT IS THE HIGHEST POT WE'VE HAD SO FAR. OH, YEAH! YEAH! Andy: IT'S GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AT THE [ BLEEP ] TABLE. HA-HA-HA! THAT IS GOING DOWN! I CAN'T SEE FOR CRAP OUT THERE. Narrator: BUT WITH WAVES PITCHING THE BOAT IN EVERY DIRECTION, THE 700-POUND CAGES GET HARDER TO WRESTLE ONBOARD. Andy: BIG WAVES ALL AROUND. IT'S LIKE RIGHT AT THE DANGEROUS -- REALLY DANGEROUS SPOT. 25-, 30-FOOT SEAS CAN JUST CRUSH A GUY. THIS IS SO [ BLEEP ]. EASY, EDDIE. COMING AROUND THE HORN. WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT! Uwekoolani: YEAH, THANK GOODNESS SHEA KIND OF HELD ONTO IT, BECAUSE IT CHASED ME ACROSS THE DECK. Newberry: WOO! THAT WAS THE LAST ONE OF THIS CARNIVAL. CARNIVAL IS SHUTTING DOWN. I HOPE. Narrator: BUT BEFORE THE MEN CAN CLEAR THE DECK, A 35-FOOT BLAST SWALLOWS THE BOW... AND SENDS JOHNATHAN'S SON, SCOTTY... WHOA! WHOA... ON THE RIDE OF HIS LIFE. [ BLEEP ] Andy: [ Laughing ]  WHAT'RE YOU DOING? I'VE NEVER SEEN... WHAT WAS THAT? Scott: THE BOW WENT UP, AND I WAS STANDING ABOUT MIDSHIP, AND IT WAS STRAIGHT FROM THE PICKING POINT OF THE PICKING BOOM. IT PICKED ME STRAIGHT UP OFF THE DECK. I WENT UP SO FAST, IF I WOULD'VE LET GO I WOULD'VE FREAKING HURT MYSELF. SO I HUNG ON, RUSSELL YELLED, AND I JUST WENT ALONG FOR THE RIDE. Andy: THAT JUST ABOUT GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK. THOUGHT I HAD A MAJOR CRISIS ON MY HAND, JOHN. Narrator: 52 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST, THE WIZARD MADE IT THROUGH DEEP STORMY WATERS TO THE OPIE GROUNDS. Keith: THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. WE'RE FINALLY COMING OUT OF THE ABYSS, THE REAL DEEP WATER, COMING UP THE HILL, AND WE'RE FINALLY IN LESS THAN 100 FATHOMS OF WATER. IT'S A PRETTY NICE FEELING WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE BACK IN THE DEPTH THAT YOU CAN SET YOUR GEAR AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT BEING GONE FOREVER. Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN DUMPED 100 POTS IN HIGH SEAS, BUT HE STILL HAS 150 TO GO. BUT JUST BEFORE THEY DROP THEIR LAST STRING, THE HYDRAULICS GIVE OUT. Soper: DOES THE BAIT CHOPPER STILL TURN ON? YEAH, I HAVE THE LEVER ON. IT'S NOT WORKING. WHEN THE HYDRAULICS DON'T WORK, IT AFFECTS EVERYTHING. THE BAIT CHOPPER WON'T WORK, THE CRANES, THE LAUNCHER, THE BLOCK, THE COILER, THE ANCHOR WINCH -- NOTHING WORKS. IT'S KIND OF A -- IT'S A MUST-HAVE AROUND HERE. THIS CAN'T BE GOOD. Narrator: NOT KNOWING WHY HIS CREW HAS STOPPED DOWN, KEITH BUSTS IN ON HIS BROTHER'S BREAKFAST AND GETS HIM ON THE CASE. Andy: MOUSE, THE WEATHER'S GOING TO GO TO CRAP ON US HERE. IF WE NEED TO TEAR ANYTHING OPEN DOWN THERE, LET'S DO IT NOW. WHAT WAS WORKING OUT THERE, WHAT WAS NOT? I HAVE NO IDEA. NOBODY'S TOLD ME [ BLEEP ]. I'VE HEAD NOTHING FROM MY [ BLEEP ] CREW. IF WE JUST SMOKED ONE OF OUR PUMPS, I WANT TO KNOW SO I CAN ORDER IT AND HAVE IT SITTING ON THE ISLAND, OKAY? I WANT TO KNOW NOW. AH... ENJOYABLE BREAKFAST. I THINK ONE OF THE PUMPS MAY BE... MAY BE SUSPECT. MIGHT HAVE GOT BURNT UP. WE DON'T KNOW YET. OKAY, GO AHEAD AND PUT A WRAP ON THAT. STAND BY! STAND BY! OKAY, GET EVERYBODY RIGHT HERE. ONE GUY STAY AT THE BAIT CHOPPER AND LET ME KNOW IF IT WORKS, OKAY? I'M GOING TO WATCH THIS, AND I'M GOING TO TELL CROSBY, CROSBY'S GOING TO TELL YOU, AND THEN YOU TELL THE NEXT GUY. Mouse: OKAY. TRY THE CRANE! TRY THE CRANE! MAKE IT UP! DON'T [ BLEEP ] CUT ME OUT OF THE LOOP LIKE THAT! [ BLEEP ]! ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE, I WAS JUST... NO, NO, NO. NOT A MINUTE. I WANT TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT'S GOING ON. OKAY, WELL, I'LL BE UP IN TWO MINUTES. ALL RIGHT? NO, NONE OF THIS [ BLEEP ] RELAYING THROUGH THE HOUSE [ BLEEP ]. RELAY THROUGH THE [ BLEEP ] WHEELHOUSE. ALL RIGHT. Andy: AND NOW THEY'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE... SCRAMBLING TO TRY AND GET IT FIXED SO THEY CAN COME UP HERE AND SAY, "STOP WORRYING, EVERYTHING'S OKAY." AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO THINGS ON A BOAT. EVERYTHING GOES THROUGH THE WHEELHOUSE, PERIOD. I KNOW MY BROTHER'S A TALENTED CAPTAIN, HE'S A GOOD ENGINEER WHEN HE'S GOOD DOWNSTAIRS, AS WELL. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS RIGHT NOW SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING RIGHT, I'VE GOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. Narrator: COMING UP -- A ROUTINE RESCUE AT SEA BECOMES A FIGHT... FOR SURVIVAL. Narrator: 345 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTH AMERICAN STEAMS TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN END OF THE OPIE GROUNDS. WITH A SECOND STORM APPROACHING, STEN PLANS TO SET ALL OF HIS POTS BY NIGHTFALL. PROBABLY KEEP BUILDING HERE, SO WE'VE STILL GOT A DECKLOAD OF GEAR ON DECK WE'VE GOT TO GET OFF TONIGHT. SO I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE TO SET THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION HERE SO THE CREW'S SAFE. Narrator: GREENHORN DARRELL "DEEBO" LABAY PREPARES TO GET SCHOOLED BY DECK BOSS JOHN SKAAR. I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY 100% WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO, BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE TEACHING ME. AFTER DAVIN OPENS THE DOOR UP, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THAT SIDE, SO AFTER THE COIL COMES OUT AND THE BUOYS, RIGHT AWAY, THE BAIT GOES IN. RIGHT ON. YEAH... FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS THE HEAVY BAIT FIRST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE MOMENTUM, SO I'D STRING THAT FIRST AND DO YOUR JAR LAST. YOU GUYS READY? HERE WE GO. John: OKAY, FRONT DOOR, DEEBO, FRONT DOOR. Sten: I KNOW FOR A FACT, WHEN I WAS ON DECK, IT DID NOT GO THAT SLOW. John: DEEBO, HEY, OPILIO, FIRST POT! THERE IT GOES. THAT TOOK TOO LONG. Narrator: FOR THE GREENHORN, EVERYTHING IS NEW, EVEN LEARNING HOW TO WALK. Sten: NO ONE JUST COMES STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE AND CAN JUST WALK ON A BOAT, JUST LIKE YOU'RE ON LAND. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. TRY TO NOT HOLD ON TO SOMETHING. TURN AROUND AND LOOK OUT AT THE WAVES. JUST DROP THAT FOR A SECOND. LOOK OUT THERE AT THE WAVES. YOU JUST NEED TO GET YOUR BALANCE... GET YOUR BODY, GET YOUR -- THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET, YOUR TOES ARE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW. THE REST IS JUST YOU LOOKING OUT THERE, OKAY? AND THEN ONCE YOU GET ZEN WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION, YOU CAN JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BE COMPLETELY LEVEL. GOT YOU. Sten: HEY, DEEBO, I WOULD START GETTING READY FOR THAT FIRST POT! DON'T HURRY IT, YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. John: OKAY, DOOR, DOOR. DOOR, DEEBO. DOOR, DEEBO. AND WATCH OUT FOR THAT EYE -- THAT THING RIGHT THERE. YOU'VE GOT TO PUSH THE POT DOWN. OUT HERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS, AND, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ONLY TELL DEEBO SO MUCH. YEAH, I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY. I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T BE OUT IN THIS [ BLEEP ], MAN? IF YOU'RE NOT, THEN YOU'RE STUPID. [ LAUGHS ] I THINK DEEBO THOUGHT THAT TODAY WOULD BE A LOT EASIER. OH, MAN DOWN! MAN DOWN! YOU OKAY? Narrator: FOR DEEBO, THE BRUISES OF HIS FIRST DAY MAY BE A RUDE AWAKENING, BUT FOR DECK BOSS, JOHN, A WELCOME SIGHT. John: DEEBO. DEEBO WILL BE WEARING THE HONORARY GREENHORN HAT. THIS IS PART OF YOUR RAIN GEAR. WOW. WELCOME ABOARD THE NORTH AMERICAN. Narrator: 73 MILES DUE SOUTH, CORNELIA MARIE CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS SET ALL 180 OF HIS POTS THROUGHOUT THE STORM. ON DECK, THE CREW PULLS THE FIRST TEST POT AFTER LETTING IT SOAK FOR EIGHT HOURS. [ Laughing ] YEAH. Phil: ANOTHER FEW HOURS AND THAT POT WILL BE CHOCKABLOCK FULL. YEAH, I -- WE'RE RIGHT WHERE WE NEED TO BE WITH THE CRAB. THERE'S 350, 400 IN THAT POT IN NINE HOURS. THAT'S BIG FISHING. COMING UP! Phil: THAT IS ONE FULL CRAB POT. YEE-HA! THERE'S CRAB IN THE AREA. WE GO BACK AND HAUL IT ON A 16-, 18-HOUR SOAK, THERE WON'T BE DAYLIGHT IN THAT POT. Narrator: BUT WITHOUT WARNING, ONE OF PHIL'S ENGINES BEGINS TO OVERHEAT. [ WARNING TONE ] I DON'T UNDERSTAND. Narrator: WITH THE ENGINE OVERHEATING, PHIL SENDS MURRAY TO INVESTIGATE. WELL, MURRAY WILL LOOK AT IT. MURRAY CAN DAMN NEAR FIX ANYTHING. NOT TOO WORRIED RIGHT NOW. Gamrath: JUST PART OF THE [ BLEEP ] ON A BOAT. YEAH. THE ONLY THING THAT I'M SEEING RIGHT NOW IS LACK OF WATER PRESSURE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THE TEMPERATURES GO UP AND DOWN. BUT THAT BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT. YEP. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT SHOULD BE BOILING OVER RIGHT NOW. Narrator: PHIL CALLS HIS MECHANIC IN DUTCH HARBOR. CHRIS, PHIL. HEY -- WELL, NOT GOOD. WE GOT A HEAD GASKET OUT AGAIN, I GUESS. I -- OKAY, BYE-BYE. EVERYBODY'S SORRY, EVERYBODY FEELS BAD, BUT THAT DOESN'T DO ME A [ BLEEP ] BIT OF GOOD. ONE OF TWO THINGS -- I'VE GOT SOME KIND OF BLOCKAGE GOING ON SOMEWHERE, THERE'S STILL AIR IN THE SYSTEM, OR THE THERMOSTATS AREN'T QUITE WORKING THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO, I DON'T KNOW. Narrator: FISHING WITH AN OVERHEATING ENGINE IS NEVER A GOOD OPTION, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SECOND STORM FRONT COMING IN. Phil: I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I REALLY DON'T. THE SAD PART ABOUT THE WHOLE THING IS I SPENT $40,000, $50,000 SO THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN. [ WARNING TONE ] Narrator: PHIL MIGHT AS WELL HAVE FLUSHED THE CASH DOWN THE TOILET. THE SECOND ALARM SIGNALS A COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE. [ WARNING TONE ] JUST 48 HOURS INTO THE OPILIO SEASON, CAPTAIN PHIL MUST TURN BACK TO DUTCH HARBOR. THE CRAB COUNT. Narrator: DAWN BREAKS OVER THE BERING SEA. AFTER SUFFERING NEARLY 48 HOURS OF BACK-TO-BACK ARCTIC STORMS, CAPTAINS BUCKLE DOWN FOR A NEW WEATHER SYSTEM TEARING THROUGH THE GROUNDS. THE FORECAST CALLS FOR 70-KNOT WINDS AND 30-FOOT SEAS. Man: ALL STATIONS, THIS IS UNITED STATES  COAST GUARD SECTOR JUNEAU, UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  SECTOR JUNEAU -- BERING SEA... Narrator: JUST BEFORE 10:00 IN THE MORNING, THE COAST GUARD INTERCEPTS THEIR FIRST DISTRESS CALL OF THE SEASON. WITHIN MINUTES, THE RESCUE TEAM PREPARES FOR FLIGHT. Narrator: 42-YEAR-OLD CREWMAN RAFAEL OROSCO HAS SUFFERED A SERIES OF LIFE-THREATENING SEIZURES. AND WITH LIMITED MEDICAL SUPPLIES ONBOARD THE PROCESSOR, THE COAST GUARD IS HIS ONLY CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL. AS THE COAST GUARD CHOPPER APPROACHES THE PROCESSOR... THE CREWMAN PREPARES TO DROP THE BASKET. BUT WITH WEATHER RAPIDLY DETERIORATING, THE COAST GUARD WILL HAVE LIMITED TIME BEFORE IT BECOMES TOO DANGEROUS FOR A BASKET RESCUE. Narrator: WITH THE FISHERMAN SAFELY ONBOARD, SWIMMER LUKE CORDERON QUICKLY CHECKS HIS VITAL SIGNS. Narrator: THE PATIENT SUFFERS FROM HIGH BLOOD SUGAR, AND IS QUICKLY ADMINISTERED INSULIN IN AN I.V. TO TRY AND KEEP HIM STABLE. THE CLOSEST HOSPITAL IS MORE THAN 850 MILES AWAY. RAFAEL'S CONDITIONS COULD WORSEN, SENDING HIM INTO MORE SEIZURES. PILOT TODD BLOCK SETS A 235 MILE COURSE TOWARDS COLD BAY, ALASKA, WHERE A PLANE AWAITS TO TRANSPORT THE PATIENT TO A HOSPITAL IN ANCHORAGE. BUT STANDING IN THE WAY OF COLD BAY ARE HIGH WINDS, FREEZING SPRAY, AND A BUILDING 200-SQUARE-MILE STORM FRONT. Narrator: THE COAST GUARD JAYHAWK RESCUE HELICOPTER CAN WITHSTAND SOME OF THE MOST BRUTAL WEATHER CONDITIONS ON THE BERING SEA, BUT IT'S COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS AGAINST ICE. Narrator: IF THE DE-ICING APPARATUS FAILS, ICE CLOGS THE JET AIR INTAKE, THE ENGINE STALLS, ROTORS SLOW, AND THE HELICOPTER DROPS LIKE A ROCK FROM THE SKY. Narrator: WITH SUCH RAPID ICING, THE PILOTS CALL BACK TO BASE FOR OTHER OPTIONS. Narrator: BUT NO RESPONSE. FIVE MEN, RADIO SILENCE, RAPID ICING. WHAT STARTED AS A ROUTINE RESCUE MISSION HAS NOW BECOME A RACE FOR SURVIVAL. [ RADIO CHATTER ] ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH" -- THE COAST GUARD BATTLES ICE, HIGH WINDS, AND LOW FUEL IN A RACE TO GET THEIR PATIENT TO MEDICAL ATTENTION.
