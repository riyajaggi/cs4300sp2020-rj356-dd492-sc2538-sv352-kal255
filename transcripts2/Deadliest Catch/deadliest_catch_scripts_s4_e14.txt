 PRETTY SOON THIS STUFF IS GONNA GET THICKER AND THICKER, AND IT'S GOING TO HARDEN, AND IT'S JUST GONNA FREEZE UP, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN OR OUT. THIS PLACE IS A FREAKIN' NIGHTMARE. Narrator: AND AS TEMPERATURES RAPIDLY DROP BELOW ZERO, IT WILL ONLY BE A MATTER OF HOURS BEFORE THE ICE FREEZES SOLID, TRAPPING THE NORTHWESTERN IN THE HARBOR. Sig: PROBLEM ONE, GET UNLOADED QUICKLY. PROBLEM TWO, JUST GET OUT OF HERE AND MAKE IT OUT OF THE HARBOR. Narrator: BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM SIG FACES. THE ICE PACK NORTH OF THE FISHING GROUNDS IS GROWING AND HEADING SOUTH. IF THE ICE BEATS SIG TO HIS GEAR, IT COULD DRAG HIS POTS FOR MILES, OR WORSE, SWALLOW THEM WHOLE. FOREMOST IS TO GET OUR POTS AND GET THEM TO SAFETY BEFORE THE ICE DOES HIT THEM. SO IT'S HAPPENING FAST, A LOT FASTER THAN I EVER EXPECTED. Narrator: BY MIDNIGHT, THE 184,000-POUND OFF-LOAD IS COMPLETE, BUT THEY ARE FAR FROM SAFE. THE HARBOR IS NOW CHOKED UP WITH TONS OF BOAT-CRIPPLING ICE. WE DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK IN HERE. OKAY. WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO JUST THROTTLE HARD. Narrator: 70 MILES AWAY, THE ICE PACK IS CLOSING IN ON THE CRAB GROUNDS AT A RATE NO ONE COULD HAVE IMAGINED. ICE IS COMING DOWN. THEY FIGURE IT'S GOING TO MOVE 30 MILES THE NEXT 24 HOURS, WHICH IS UNHEARD OF. SO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND GET THOSE POTS MOVED. Narrator: SIG CASTS OFF AND HOPES HE CAN PLOW HIS WAY TOWARD OPEN WATER. Sig: HERE WE GO. THAT COLOR ON THE ICE, THAT'S BOAT PAINT. THE RED ON THE ICE THERE. IT'S STARTING TO GET HARD. I'M GONNA BACK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT. I'M PUSHING THESE ICE CHUNKS OVER, AND THEY DON'T WANT TO PUSH. WE'RE LOCKED. THAT ICE IS PUSHING THE BOW IN. Narrator: TRYING TO BUY SOME WIGGLE ROOM, SIG JOCKEYS THE 125-FOOT  NORTHWESTERN, FIRST FORWARD... Sig: THIS COULD GET UGLY. Narrator: ...AND THEN REVERSE. WE'RE SCREWED. WOW! THAT DON'T LOOK GOOD. I DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH A [BLEEP] UP PROPELLER. NO, BUT IF YOU BACK UP, YOU CAN STILL -- YEAH, BUT DUDE, THERE'S NO WATER BACK THERE. WE'RE GOING TO BE KICKING UP MUD HERE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. A LITTLE BIT MORE. WE'RE SPRINGING OFF THE ICE NOW. DUDE, WHERE I'M PACKING, THIS ICE IS PUSHING MY STERN IN. SO THIS IS GOOD. Narrator: FINALLY, THE MOUNTAIN OF ICE THAT'S LOCKED THEM IN PLACE BEGINS TO WORK TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. I THINK WE'RE OKAY, EDGAR. IT WAS REALLY HARD TO -- TO EVEN SPRING THE BOAT OUT FROM THE DOCK, TRYING TO PUSH THE PACK ICE THAT WAS PACKED IN THE HARBOR AWAY SO I COULD GET ENOUGH ROOM TO MANEUVER. IT'S JUST -- IT'S UGLY. Narrator: AFTER TRUDGING THROUGH NEARLY 1,000 FEET OF ICE, THE NORTHWESTERN FINALLY REACHES OPEN WATER. IT'S NOT EASY. Narrator: 270 MILES TO THE SOUTH, THE WIZARD IS OFF-LOADING 407,000 POUNDS OF OPILIOS. CAPTAIN KEITH ALSO OFF-LOADED GREENHORN JASON MOILANEN. THAT'S THE LAST TIME YOU'RE GOING TO WALK IN MY WHEELHOUSE. MOI'S CONSTANT COMPLAINING WILL NOT BE MISSED. BUT AS THEY LEAVE PORT, UP IN THE WHEELHOUSE, CAPTAIN KEITH'S BROTHER MONTE HAS A GRIPE OF HIS OWN. Monte: HOW DO YOU THINK IT FEELS TO ME WHEN YOU GO TO BED FOR FIVE HOURS AND I COME UP HERE AND SOPER'S BEEN DRIVING FOR THREE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? LAST TRIP. AWESOME TRIP. OH, I'M LETTING SOPER DRIVE INSTEAD OF YOU. GIVE ME A BREAK. ALL RIGHT? DON'T SET THE TONE FOR THE TRIP WITH AN OFFHANDED CRAPPY REMARK. LOOK AT MY END OF THINGS. I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT, TOO. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE AT. I SIGNED ON WITH YOU... YOU SIGNED ON -- ...TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND A CERTAIN CALIBER ON THIS BOAT, RIGHT? YEAH. MOUSE, BOTTOM LINE IS THIS -- YOU STOLE THAT FROM ME LAST TRIP, DIDN'T YOU? NO, I DIDN'T -- OFFHANDEDLY. MONTE, I DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING FROM YOU LAST TRIP. IT'S MY BOAT. I'M THE ONE DOING ALL THE WORK TO PUT THE QUOTA ON HERE, EVERYTHING, ALL RIGHT? DON'T START THE TRIP ON A BAD NOTE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY TEMPER. NO, I WAS NOT -- I WAS TRYING TO POKE FUN. I WOULD RATHER FOR ONCE HAVE A PERSONAL CONVERSATION AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TAPE RECORDERS AND CAMERAS UP OUR ASS. I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH SOMETIMES, MOUSE. GET THAT OUT OF MY FACE NOW! ALL RIGHT. DEAL? DEAL. DO YOU THINK I LIKE JUGGLING PERMITS? DO YOU THINK I LIKE TAKING CARE OF ALL THAT EXTRA [BLEEP] IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMMON SENSE -- YOU DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR. I'M A ROTTEN BASTARD NOW. NO -- JUST REMEMBER IT. JUST REMEMBER IT NEXT TIME YOU FEEL LIKE -- AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU SUCCESSFUL. JUST REMEMBER IT NEXT TIME YOU FEEL LIKE PUTTING YOUR FOOT IN YOUR MOUTH, MOUSE. DON'T DO IT TO ME AGAIN, OR YOU WILL NOT BE ON THIS BOAT. I'M GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY. DON'T ABUSE THAT OPPORTUNITY. YOU GOT IT? I DO HAVE IT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING -- NO, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY OTHER THING. YOU DON'T? NO, THAT'S THE END OF THE CONVERSATION. OKAY, THAT'S FINE. YOUR -- YOUR PRIVILEGE AS MY BROTHER IS NOW OFFICIALLY OVER. YOU'RE NOW A CREWMAN. GOT IT? [ SIGHS ] I'M NOT LEAVING TOWN THE WAY I WANTED TO LEAVE TOWN. I'M LEAVING TOWN 12 HOURS LATER THAN I WANTED TO LEAVE TOWN, I HAVE MARGINAL WEATHER I'M TRYING TO BEAT AGAIN, AND LEAVING TOWN IN A REAL ANGRY MOOD BECAUSE MY BROTHER JUST GETS UNDER MY SKIN IN THE WORST WAY AT THE WORST TIME. Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... IS EVERYTHING OKAY, YOU KNOW? Phil: I'M NOT OUT OF THE WOODS. I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. Narrator: 300 MILES TO THE NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR ON THE TIME BANDIT... WHOO! Andy: AAH, THIS IS IMPRESSIVE. Narrator: ...THE FIVE-MAN CREW HAVE BEEN PULLING POTS WITHOUT A BREAK SINCE THEIR OFF-LOAD, NEARLY THREE DAYS AGO. Andy: BEAUTIFUL OUT. LIVING THE DREAM. PULLING HALF-FULL POTS ALMOST. Narrator: IN THE SIX WEEKS HAULING FROM THEIR SACRED GROUNDS... Johnathan: MAGOO'S BEEN GOOD TO US. CAUGHT MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF OPILIO AT MAGOO. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN ANDY HAS BEEN ON A HOT STREAK... YEAH, BABY! Narrator: ...TANKING NEARLY 270,000 POUNDS FROM MR. MAGOO. YOU THINK THIS IS PRETTY GOOD CRABBING, EARON? I DO. YEAH, YOU BETTER THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD CRABBING RIGHT NOW. OH, YEAH. THEY'LL BE BACK. Narrator: WITH NEAL NOW RETIRED, HIS NEPHEW, SCOTT, HAS SPENT THE TRIP HONING HIS SKILLS ON THE HYDRAULICS. Scott: GOT TO TAKE OUR TIME, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT GETS ROUGH, AND MAKE SURE WE GET THE JOB DONE WITHOUT HURTING ANYBODY. Andy: SCOTTY'S COMING ALONG ON THE HYDRAULICS. DOING A DAMN GOOD JOB. HE'S STAYING SAFE. HE'S NOT DOING NOTHING CRAZY, TRYING TO GO FAST. SO I'VE GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM, AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T TAKE MY WINDOWS OUT... LIKE RIGHT NOW. Narrator: BUT THE EXTRA TIME SCOTT HAS SPENT LANDING THE POTS IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON AN ALREADY FATIGUED CREW. I MISS NEAL. JUST TAKES PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO JUST COOPERATE. BEING BACK AT HOME RUNNING EXCAVATORS AND DOZERS ALL THE TIME, I'M JUST NOT USED TO WORKING A SYSTEM LIKE THIS. I'VE GOT THESE POTS SWINGING LIKE A PENDULUM, AND I'M TRYING TO MANEUVER THEM. IT'S NOT FAST AT ALL. SO I GOT LIKE A THREE-SECOND DELAY ON SOME OF MY CONTROLS. Andy: STOP, STOP, STOP,  STOP, STOP, STOP. STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING  WITH THE CRANE. YOU CAN'T DO TWO VALVES AT ONCE ON THE CRANE WHEN THE BLOCK IS RUNNING. YOU ALMOST KILLED THE AUXILIARY, WHICH KILLS ALL OF OUR POWER. THAT'S NOT GOOD TO DO THAT  TO AN ENGINE, EVER, EVER, EVER. SCOTTY ALMOST KILLED THE ENGINE. I JUST CAN'T -- IT'S IN MY HEAD, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO DO MY JOB. DOING WHAT I CAN. IF YOU GOT A GOOD CREW AND IF YOU'RE AWARE AND YOU GOT A LOT OF SAFETY, THEN EVERYTHING GOES JUST FINE. Long: DREAM ABOUT 600 KEEPERS. WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT! YEAH. YEAH, DUMB ASS. THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T STAND ON THAT SIDE. THAT'S WHY. Johnathan: THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE HYDRAULIC GUY FORGETS TO PUT THE DOGS ON THE POT. COULD'VE KILLED SOMEBODY IF THEY WOULD'VE BEEN IN THE WAY. YEP, ROOKIE MISTAKE. THESE DOGS COME UP. THEY HOOK HERE AND DOWN AT THE BOTTOM. FORCES THE BAR INTO THIS ONE, MAKES THE LAUNCHER AND THE POT INTO ONE ENTITY. SCOTTY FORGOT TO TURN THESE ON. Narrator: WITHOUT THE DOGS SECURED, THE MASSIVE 1,000-POUND STEEL POT MISSES SHEA BY INCHES. OH, THE POT IS ABOUT 1,000 POUNDS, MAN. THAT COULD EASILY KILL YOU. GET YOUR CRANE, TAKE THE POT,  LIFT IT UP OVER THE TABLE. COMING OUT OF THE AIR, ABOUT SIX FEET IN THE AIR. WATCH OUT! 700-POUND [BLEEP] JUST IF IT HITS YOUR ARM AND BRUSHES, IT COULD BREAK YOUR ARM. NEVER TRUST THE HYDRAULIC GUY EVER. NEVER, EVER, NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THAT POT. ONE LITTLE SLIP, ONE LITTLE FORGETFULNESS ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD KILL A GUY LIKE THAT. IT WOULD HAVE RUINED OUR TRIP. WOULD'VE RUINED OUR LIFE. SOMEBODY'S LIFE, THAT'S FOR SURE. YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, SCOTTY. I'M JUST LUCKY THAT NOBODY GOT HURT. I'D HAVE BEEN FEELING PRETTY BAD ABOUT IT IF SOMEBODY HAD. Narrator: DRIFTING OFF THE GEAR, 190 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST... IS THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE. IT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS SINCE CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS LEFT THE BOAT TO SEEK MEDICAL HELP IN ANCHORAGE. AND HIS OLDEST SON, JOSH, HASN'T MISSED A MORNING CHECKING IN. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] HI. DO YOU HEAR ME ALL RIGHT? YEAH. WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY? OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, I'LL BE TALKING TO YOU THROUGHOUT THE TRIP, BUT THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE I WON'T BE BACK ON THE BOAT THIS SEASON. WELL, ARE YOU OKAY NOW, THOUGH? IS EVERYTHING OKAY, YOU KNOW? RIGHT NOW THEY CAME IN AND REMINDED ME THAT I'M NOT OUT OF THE WOODS. I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. WE STILL GOT THE BACK SIDE TO GO THROUGH. HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN ON BEING THERE FOR? I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T WANT ME OUT, YOU KNOW? IF I WENT OUT ON THAT BOAT AND STUBBED MY TOE UNDER THAT MEDICATION, I WOULD BLEED TO DEATH. OKAY. IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN, IT WOULD BE A HELL OF A MESS. I GOT YOUR BACK, DAD. ANYWAY, I JUST -- I'M GIVING YOU A HEADS-UP TO LET YOU START THINKING ALONG THEM LINES. AND I'LL TELL YOU MORE LATER. I love you, buddy. You be safe. I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON. WELL, THANKS. ALL RIGHT. BYE. UM... WELL, MY DAD'S FISHING CAREER MIGHT'VE ENDED. HE'S REALLY, REALLY SCARED. Man: THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE PHIL. THERE IS NO WAY, AS LONG AS HE IS BREATHING, THAT HE'S GOING TO SIT AT HOME. Narrator: WITH THEIR FIRST STRING OFF THE BOW, THE CREW HITS THE DECK. Man: WELL, WE'RE GETTING READY TO START A LONG 36-HOUR DAY BECAUSE I'M GOING TO PUSH IT RIGHT TO THE LIMIT. DAN. GET YOUR ASS UP HERE. I'M HURTING TODAY, BUDDY. Narrator: GREENHORN DAN STUMBLED AT THE GET-GO. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I'M GOOD. THIS IS TOTALLY A TEAM EFFORT OUT HERE. HEAVIEST ONE YET. Narrator: BUT HE PULLED THROUGH A 36-HOUR GRIND AND NOW FACES ANOTHER 200 POTS. WHOO! I THINK BY THE END OF THIS, HE'LL BE WANTING TO GET OFF. [ LAUGHS ] ♪ RAIN ♪ ♪ IS GONNA COME DOWN ♪ ♪ IS GONNA COME DOWN ♪ ♪ CHANGE ♪ WE'RE ALWAYS SAYING DAY TWO IS HELL. TODAY IS THAT DAY. Narrator: BUT HELL IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY, ESPECIALLY IF IT ENABLES PHIL'S PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY TATTERED CREW TO REACH THEIR GOAL. ♪ IS GONNA COME DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN ♪ ♪ DOWN, DOWN, YEAH, GONNA COME DOWN ♪ ♪ CHANGE ♪ ♪ IS GONNA COME AROUND ♪ ♪ IS GONNA COME AROUND ♪ ♪ YEAH ♪ Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... PICK UP 25 POTS, BEAT ICE FOR THREE HOURS. Narrator: 280 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, NORTHWESTERN CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN IS RACING TO HIS NORTHERNMOST FISHING GROUNDS. HIS MISSION -- TO RESCUE OVER $100,000 WORTH OF GEAR FROM THE DESCENDING ICE PACK. WE'VE DECIDED TO START PICKING THEM UP RIGHT OFF THE BAT, STACK THESE POTS NO MATTER WHAT'S IN THEM, AND GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF HERE. THE REPORTS SAY IT'S GONNA MOVE 30 MILES THE NEXT 24 HOURS, WHICH PUTS IT RIGHT HERE. THESE ARE ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU'RE STUCK BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD SPOT. YOU HAVE TO HAUL THESE POTS. IF WE DON'T HAUL THEM AND WE WAIT FOR BETTER WEATHER, THE POTS COULD BE COVERED IN ICE, AND OUR SEASON IS OVER. Narrator: ONE OF THE FASTEST BOATS IN THE FLEET, THE NORTHWESTERN COVERS THE 42 MILES FROM ST. PAUL TO THE GROUNDS IN JUST UNDER FOUR HOURS. BUT AS THEY APPROACH THEIR FIRST STRING, THE BERING SEA GREETS THEM WITH MINUS-5 DEGREE TEMPERATURES AND FREEZING SPRAY. IT'S COLDER THAN A WITCH'S [BLEEP] MAN. ICE. EVERYTHING'S ICE. I GOT A HEADACHE JUST BEING OUT THERE FOR ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW, 15 SECONDS. NO JOKE. Narrator: BEFORE THE CREW CAN START HAULING AND STACKING THEIR GEAR, THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK ON LOSING SOME WEIGHT. THIS IS NOT SAFE. BOATS HAVE ROLLED OVER BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE ICE OFF. THAT'S JUST RIGHT HERE. IT'S PROBABLY WORSE UP THERE. Narrator: FINALLY, AFTER TWO HOURS OF BREAKING ICE IN SUB-ZERO TEMPERATURES, THE CREW BEGINS RESCUING THEIR POTS. OH, YEAH! YEAH! WHOO! [ LAUGHS ] WOW! OH, GOD. WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME ICE OFF THE BOAT. PICK UP 25 POTS, BEAT ICE FOR THREE HOURS. Narrator: HELL ON THE NORTHWESTERN IS 25-FOOT SEAS COMBINED WITH RELENTLESS ICE BUILD-UP. DESPITE THE UNBEARABLE WORKING CONDITIONS, SIG IS AVERAGING OVER 750 KEEPERS. WHOO-HOO! GNARLY OUT. Narrator: AFTER EIGHT HELLISH HOURS, THEY'VE MANAGED TO RESCUE 65 OF THEIR 130 POTS. THEY'VE ALSO PUT 45,000 POUNDS OF CRAB IN THE TANKS. BUT IN A MATTER OF HOURS, THIS HONEY HOLE WILL BE COVERED WITH ICE. THAT'S A FISHERMAN'S NIGHTMARE, YOU KNOW. IT'S A POT OF GOLD. YOU FINALLY GOT YOUR STUFF DIALED IN, YOU'VE GOT A FEEL FOR THE AREA... ...AND THEN MOTHER NATURE JUST STRIPS IT AWAY. YOU FEEL IT IN THE PIT OF YOUR STOMACH. I MEAN, IT'S SOME OF THE BETTER FISHING WE'VE SEEN IN YEARS, YOU KNOW. THE FACT THAT I'VE GOT TO PICK UP AND MOVE IS JUST GUT-WRENCHING. Narrator: 240 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, IN THE WIZARD GALLEY. I'VE GOT A LITTLE BREAKFAST FOR THE BOYS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT THIS. THE CROSMEISTER HAS BEEN FREAKIN' HARD AT IT. FRENCH TOAST? IF GUYS WANT SOME SALT WITH THEIR FRENCH TOAST OR ANY MEAL, IN FACT, THEY CAN JUST TAKE MY ARM AND... IT'S SEA SALT. IT'S GOOD AND NATURAL. I'M GONNA GET FAT ON THIS TRIP. ANYONE START YET? Narrator: AS THE CREW SITS DOWN TO WHAT COULD BE THEIR LAST MEAL FOR DAYS, UP IN THE WHEELHOUSE, THE COLBURN BROTHERS CALL A TRUCE. IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, MOUSE, I THINK YOU KNOW WHY I'M SO BRUTAL WITH YOU. DON'T START THE TRIP ON A BAD NOTE BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY TEMPER. YOUR -- YOUR PRIVILEGE AS MY BROTHER IS NOW OFFICIALLY OVER. YOU'RE NOW A CREWMAN. I'M NOT GOING TO BE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR FOREVER. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE, WHETHER I'M RIGHT OR WRONG, THAT THE GUY THAT SITS THERE IS GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY JUST AS INTENSE AS I AM. NO, I DON'T HAVE TO [BLEEP] ASK ANYBODY ANYTHING! [ Sarcastically ] I'M UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE! HOW DO YOU THINK IT FEELS TO ME WHEN YOU GO TO BED FOR FIVE HOURS AND I COME UP HERE, AND SOPER'S BEEN DRIVING FOR THREE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S AS MUCH MY FAULT AS YOURS. WELL, IT'S AS MUCH YOUR FAULT AS IT IS YOURS. [ BOTH LAUGH ] WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE, FAMILY FIRST, FISHING SECOND. ROGER. Narrator: WITH ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEFORE THEY REACH THEIR STRING, CAPTAIN KEITH SOUNDS A FEW NOTES OF CAUTION TO THE NEW HORN, 21-YEAR-OLD COOPER WEATHERBY. BAIT CHOPPER RIGHT HERE? YEAH. THIS WILL RIP YOUR ARM COMPLETELY OFF. DO NOT EVEN SCREW AROUND, OKAY? ANYTHING EVER GETS JAMMED IN THERE, NEVER DO THIS, ALL RIGHT? WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO IS TO SUCK STUFF DOWN IN THERE. SO, IF SOMETHING'S JAMMED AND YOU'RE PUSHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT GETS FREE... YOU'LL SEE. IT DOESN'T MESS AROUND, MAN. IT'S CALLED THE COOKIE MONSTER BECAUSE IT LIKES TO GOBBLE STUFF UP. YOUR CRABBING CAREER HAS OFFICIALLY STARTED. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, YOU'RE GONNA FILL IT WRONG. SO JUST BE ACCUSTOMED TO THE IDEA OF CHANGING HOW MUCH YOU'RE PUTTING IN THE BAG. GRAB ONE OF THESE SCOOPS AND JUST START FILLING. THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF YOUR TIME IS GONNA BE MADE UP DOING. AS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY LIST IS KIND OF LOW AT THE BEGINNING, THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE EXPECTED. IT'S SUPPOSED TO GET PRETTY CRAPPY IN AN HOUR OR SO, TWO HOURS, AS FAR AS THE WEATHER GOES. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME BIG SWELLS AND COLD WEATHER, CRAZY FRONTS, CATCHING SOME CRAB. I'M ALREADY PSYCHOLOGICALLY PUMPING ME UP FOR THE GREATEST GREENHORN OF ALL TIME. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: BY THE TIME THE WIZARD ARRIVES AT THE GROUNDS, THE TEMPERATURE DROPS TO A COOL NEGATIVE-20 DEGREES. IT'S STARTING TO ICE UP, BUT I'M SURE THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. ONE NOTCH COLDER, AND IT COULD GET KIND OF UGLY FOR EVERYBODY. EVEN THE CRAB, THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN IT'S COLD. THAT'S NO GOOD. FIRST POT OF THE TRIP, CAUGHT ONE CODFISH. NOT A SINGLE CRAB. DAMN! OH, MAN! HERE WE ARE AGAIN! IT'LL PICK UP. POT NUMBER SIX COMING UP, STILL NO CRAB, BUT I HAVE HOPE. Keith: SOPER. TRY TO STACK THEM BACK HERE,  YEAH? Narrator: FOR THE SKIPPER, THIS STRING HAS BEEN LESS ABOUT THE GREENHORN'S PROGRESS AND MORE ABOUT HIS OWN ABILITY TO LAND ON THE CRAB. YEAH, FIRST SEVEN POTS RIGHT HERE ON THE EDGE STARTED OUT WITH ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, ZERO. I THINK WE FOUND THE FENCE, SO TO SPEAK. Narrator: COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH," SCOTTY HILLSTRAND'S QUEST FOR THE CAPTAIN'S CHAIR TAKES A DEADLY TURN. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! Narrator: 300 MILES TO THE NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR... ...THE TIME BANDIT CREW CONTINUES A MARATHON 72-HOUR GRIND. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR, AND THIS IS WHAT WE SEEM TO HAVE MORE OF. THEY'LL BE EASY TO PICK OUT, THAT'S FOR SURE. NO GOOD. NOT KEEPER. KEEPER. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE DONE THIS. THEY'RE ALL SMALL, AND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM. BUBKES. Narrator: WITH ONLY FEMALES AND JUVIES IN THE POTS, THE CREW BEGINS RAIL-DUMPING. Andy: YEAH, THAT'S A REAL DRAG. THE POTS ARE FULL, AND WE HAVE TO RAIL-DUMP THEM. WE'VE GOT TO GET ON OUT OF HERE. Narrator: CAPTAIN ANDY'S DECISION TO MOVE MEANS SCOTT, ALREADY FATIGUED, WILL HAVE TO REMAIN AT HIS POST AT THE HYDROS AND STACK ON ANOTHER 40 POTS. JUST TRYING TO DO IT IN A HURRY. IT'S COLD OUT. THESE GUYS ARE MISERABLE. JUST TRYING TO MAKE THIS FAST AS POSSIBLE. Narrator: BUT THE RAPIDLY DETERIORATING WEATHER ISN'T MAKING THE JOB ANY EASIER FOR THE 25-YEAR-OLD HEIR APPARENT. THE CRANE CONTROLS ARE FROZEN. HE'S PROBABLY STRESSING 'CAUSE HE HASN'T STACKED THAT MUCH BEFORE, YOU KNOW. HE'S GOT TO GO ON TOP NOW. Narrator: AFTER A FEW POTS AND WITH LARGER SWELLS ROLLING IN, CAPTAIN ANDY TURNS THE HELM OVER TO NEAL... AND HITS THE DECK TO WATCH OVER HIS NEPHEW. AFTER A LONG DAY IN THE OFFICE, I COME OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT THE WEATHER IS LIKE. FREEZING CONDITIONS. Narrator: BIG BROTHER JOHNATHAN IS SOON TO FOLLOW. NOW TO ADD MORE PRESSURE, SCOTT HAS TO DEAL WITH THE HILLSTRAND PEANUT GALLERY. YOU CAN DO IT, SCOTT. YOU CAN DO IT! YOU GUYS TRYING TO [BLEEP] BLIND US? SO, HERE. WE CAN STACK THAT ONE POT THERE. I KNOW, NEAL SAID HE DOESN'T WANT ANY POTS IN HIS EYESIGHT. ALL DAY LONG, THEY'VE HAD -- HEY, LISTEN. PUT THE POT RIGHT THERE, THERE, ONE THERE, AND DOWN HERE. YOU'RE GOOD. NO, PUT IT DOWN HERE. Scott: I DON'T LIKE IT. WE'VE GOT LIKE SIX OR SEVEN POTS FOR DIFFERENT SIZES. ONCE WE START GETTING THOSE, IT GETS KIND OF TRICKY WHERE I'M GOING TO PUT THEM. JUST STACK THEM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SIZE. Andy: WHAT DID YOU SAY?! WATCH OUT. WATCH OUT. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! GOT HIM IN THE HEAD. GET YOU? YOU OKAY? Narrator: AS THE BOAT TAKES A ROLL, SCOTT LOSES CONTROL OF THE 1,000-POUND POT. IT COMES WITHIN INCHES OF CRUSHING GREENHORN EARON OVERSON'S SKULL. COULD'VE CAUGHT HIM RIGHT IN THE HEAD. KNOCKED HIM DOWN. GOT WAY TOO MANY [BLEEP] GUYS IN MY WORK AREA. WELL, DO YOUR [BLEEP] JOB! "POT THERE! OVER THERE! OVER THERE!" DON'T BLAME IT ON ANYBODY. BLAME IT ON ME. COULD HAVE [BLEEP] 16 DANCING GIRLS OUT HERE. CAN'T [BLEEP] BLAME IT ON US. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] Scott: I'M [BLEEP] PISSED OFF. I'M [BLEEP] TRYING TO DO MY JOB OUT HERE, AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY ALL WANT ME DOING DIFFERENT STUFF. IT'S NICE TO KNOW BEFOREHAND INSTEAD OF GETTING STUCK BEHIND AND THEN NOW, YOU KNOW, LOOK, I ALMOST KILLED SOMEBODY. WATCH OUT. WATCH OUT. WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT! EARLIER, I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING THREE-HIGH. WHY THE [BLEEP] DO WE GOT TO GO THREE-HIGH? I'M JUST SAYING. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. JUST WATCH YOUR GUYS. THAT WAS BAD. THAT WAS BAD. I'M AWARE OF THAT. Man: COMING UP. COMING AT YOU. HOW'S MY HEAD? Andy: SHOWS US YOUR HEAD, YEAH. MY HEAD'S STILL ON. ACTUALLY, HE WAS A DUMB [BLEEP] FOR BEING IN THE WAY OF THE POT IN THE FIRST PLACE. I'LL LET THAT ONE GO THIS TIME. WATCH YOUR [BLEEP] HEAD, DUDE. THERE WASN'T EVEN ANY TIME TO. I HAD THE POT AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE WAVE HIT. IT'S A MOUSETRAP HERE NOW. YOU CAN'T STAND BACK THERE WHEN THAT POT COMES OVER THE RAIL. GOT TO HAVE A PLACE TO RUN AND HIDE. Narrator: ALTHOUGH SCOTT NEARLY KILLED HIS BUDDY EARON JOHNATHAN ORDERS HIS SON TO STAY AT THE HYDROS TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH THE PRESSURE. WE TESTED HIS MENTAL FORTITUDE. WE SAW IT SNAP. WE SAW IT SNAP, LITERALLY. Narrator: JOHNATHAN AND ANDY HEAD INSIDE TO DISCUSS SCOTT'S NEARLY FATAL MISTAKE AND HIS POOR REACTION. WE JUST ABOUT KILLED SOMEBODY. [ LAUGHS ] WE JUST ABOUT SMASHED HIS HEAD. HE ALMOST SMASHED SOMEBODY'S [BLEEP] HEAD. YEAH, WE DON'T CARE IF THERE'S 16 NAKED DANCING GIRLS. DO YOUR JOB. [ BLEEP ] YOU DON'T SWING THAT POT UNLESS EVERYONE'S OUT OF THE WAY. CAN'T BLAME IT ON ANYBODY ELSE. Narrator: THE CRAB COUNT. FOR THREE STRAIGHT WEEKS, THE WIZARD HAS STOMPED THE COMPETITION. Narrator: 280 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, AFTER WEEKS OF MECHANICAL FAILURES, HURRICANES, AND INJURIES, CORNELIA MARIE IS FINALLY DIALED IN TO STEADY FISHING. YEAH! WHOO! Man: I LOVE THIS. I'M SEEING BASICALLY 500s GOING INTO THE TANK RIGHT NOW. Narrator: THE CREW IS ON HOUR 30 OF A 36-HOUR GRIND. AND THE GREENHORN IS FEELING EVERY POT PULL. IT'S A LOT TO GET OUT OF ME THIS LATE AT NIGHT. WE'LL TEACH YOU. THEY'RE PUSHING ME ALONG. PUSHING ME THROUGH IT. WE'RE GOOD. NOT TOO MUCH [BLEEP] SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT HE WAS TIRED THE OTHER DAY, SO HE MUST BE EXHAUSTED TODAY. WHOO! Narrator: WITH ONE OF THE HARDEST-WORKING CREWS IN THE FLEET... ...THE GREENHORN HAS HAD HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM. BUT HE'S STAYED THE COURSE WITHOUT COMPLAINT. YEAH, THAT'S DAN'S POSITION. OH, LET'S JUST SAY HE WENT FROM STANDING TO BEING ON HIS KNEES. [ LAUGHS ] MY GREENHORN, HE'S A LITTLE TUCKERED OUT. I'M GOING TO GIVE THESE GUYS A TWO-HOUR NAP AFTER THIS. I'M DOING ALL RIGHT, HANGING IN THERE. JUST TRYING NOT TO LAY DOWN AND HANG IN HERE FOR THESE GUYS. Narrator: BY DAWN, DAN HAS SURVIVED ANOTHER 36 HOURS OF GRUELING POT PULLS, AND FREDDIE MAUGATAI GIVES HIM A SHOT AT THE RAIL. SHOOT IT, BABY! GET IT, TIGER! YEAH! PULL THAT! PULL THAT! YOU CAN DO IT! I'M TIRED. I CAN'T -- NOTHING MAKES ANY SENSE THIS MORNING. Narrator: IN JUST 72 HOURS, THE CREW HAS MANAGED TO PUT ON 120,000 POUNDS. KIND OF FEELS LIKE PRISON OUT HERE. YEAH. I TRIED SHAKING YOUR HAND WHEN I FIRST GOT ON THE BOAT. AND YOU WERE LIKE, "AFTER THE FIRST TRIP." READY? I'LL SHAKE YOUR HAND AFTER THE FIRST TRIP. NOW THAT YOU FINISHED THE TRIP, NOW YOU DESERVE TO HAVE A HANDSHAKE, AND YOU DESERVE RESPECT FROM US, BECAUSE YOU DID WORK HARD, BROTHER. Narrator: ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH"... SHE'S PISSED OFF OUT THERE. WATCH OUT. RUN. Narrator: ...IT'S THE FINAL STRETCH IN THE 2008 OPILIO CRAB SEASON. Sig: THE BOAT'S LIKE AN ICE MAGNET. WORST-CASE SCENARIO, SHE CAN ROLL OVER AND SINK. I KNOW. OW! Narrator: CREWS PUSH THROUGH THEIR BREAKING POINTS... CLOCK'S TICKING, THE SPRAY'S FREEZING, THE ICE IS CHARGING. WHOO! WALK ON WATER, BABY! Narrator: ...AS THE HUNT CONTINUES FOR THE DEADLIEST CATCH. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
