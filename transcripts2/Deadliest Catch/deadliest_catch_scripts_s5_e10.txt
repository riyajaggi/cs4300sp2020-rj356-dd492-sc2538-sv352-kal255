 Narrator: ...SKIPPERS SQUARE OFF AGAINST THE 250,000-SQUARE-MILE ARCTIC ICE PACK... Sig: 36 HOURS AGO, THE ICE WAS UP HERE. NOW IT'S ABOVE US. WE'RE FISHING IN A DANGER ZONE. Narrator: ...AS THE HUNT CONTINUES FOR THE DEADLIEST CATCH. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: TWO MILES OUT OF ST. PAUL HARBOR IS THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. SIX HOURS AGO, CAPTAIN SIG FINISHED AN OFF-LOAD THAT NETTED A $352,000 PAYCHECK. WE'RE STILL ON SCHEDULE, AND WE'RE STILL, YOU KNOW -- WE'RE STILL AHEAD OF THE GAME, FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. Narrator: NOW HE RETURNS TO A STRING

 OF 100 POTS HE LEFT OUT TO SOAK 48 HOURS AGO. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Sig: OOH. NOT GOOD. 36 HOURS AGO, THE ICE WAS UP HERE, WHICH IS ABOUT 60 MILES AWAY FROM US. NOW IT'S 40 MILES ABOVE US. AS IT STARTS LOOMING CLOSER, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO MAKE THE CALL OF WHEN WE WANT TO PICK UP OUR GEAR AND RUN. Narrator: WITH THE ICE PACK BARRELING TOWARD SIG'S NORTHERN GEAR 15 MILES TO THE NORTH, THE CREW WILL HAVE TO TURN THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STRING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BEFORE CAPTAIN SETS OUT ON A RESCUE MISSION. Man: HOLY [BLEEP] THAT'S THE BIGGEST POT YET. SIG, COMING IN! OHH, BABY! IT'S GOOD! WOW! YEAH, BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS AN EASY 600. YEAH. WOW. HO! HO! HO! [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THE NORTHWESTERN IS ON THE CRAB. IT'S 500, 600 EVERY POT. Narrator: AND THE CREW IS FLYING HIGH. YEAH! WHOO! THE WHOLE TABLE IS FULL. WOW! NOW WE NEED A BIGGER TABLE! I GOT A HALF A MIND TO RUN ABOUT A HALF-HOUR OR AN HOUR OUT WEST AND JUST DUMP THESE OUT. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S LOOKING REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW. I'M GONNA RUN IT UP 3/4 MILE, AND I'M GONNA JUST BLAST IT RIGHT BACK. Narrator: SIG'S PLAN DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH YOUNGER BROTHER EDGAR. Edgar: WE'RE STACKING THEM. NEXT QUESTION -- WHY AREN'T WE SETTING BACK? Narrator: IT'S GOING TO COST THE CREW ANOTHER FOUR HOURS OF HARD LABOR. BUT CAPTAIN SIG IS FOCUSED ON ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY -- STAYING ON THE MASSIVE OPILIO CRAB BIOMASS. BOY, SETTING BACK -- IT DOESN'T EXIST ON THIS BOAT ANYMORE. Sig: EDGAR'S SAYING TO SET BACK A LITTLE SARCASTICALLY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE. WE'VE DROPPED THE NUMBERS BY A THIRD. I'D RATHER JUST KEEP THEM DIALED IN, MAN. A LITTLE EXTRA WORK IS GONNA PAY OFF, I HOPE. JUST ANOTHER DAY ON THE OPIE GRIND. THEY DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] THEY JUST WANT IT IN THE WATER. THE FASTER IT GOES IN THE WATER, THE HAPPIER THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. Edgar: I DON'T SEE WHY. 30 HOURS. ALL CLEAN CRAB. WE COULD BLOW THROUGH THIS STRING, MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ONE AND PICK IT UP, MOVE IT DOWN HERE. THAT'S THE EASY WAY, THOUGH. THAT'S NOT THE NORWEIGIAN WAY. LAST YEAR, THAT'S ALL WE DID, WAS SET BACK... AT LESS NUMBERS. AT LEAST 700 CRAB, AND NOW WE'RE -- UNREAL. YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO JUST TRY TO STAY ON THE FRESHEST FISHING WE CAN. [ SCRAPING ] WE GOT SOME WINDCHILL GOING ON NOW. THE WINDCHILL IS PROBABLY MINUS. ARE YOU CHILLY? I'M FREEZING MY BUTT OFF. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE SPOILED THEM THIS TRIP. Narrator: GRUMBLES FROM THE CREW ONLY SERVE TO CHILL THE HEART OF THE CALLOUS SKIPPER. COLD OUT HERE. 800 CRAB MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD IN THE MORNING. [ YAWNING ] CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS STRING TO BE OVER WITH. Sig: THERE IS A BACK TANK  BACK THERE. I WANT THAT TANK FULL. BEEN FLYING THEM ALL NIGHT, AND THEY'RE COLD AND MISERABLE, AND IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE STARTING TO GET A LITTLE PISSY. THEY'RE LUCKY I'M IN A GOOD MOOD. Narrator: 335 MILES FROM THE CRAB GROUNDS, THE SUN RISES OVER DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA. WIZARD CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN IS A FULL WEEK BEHIND THE REST OF THE FLEET AND DESPERATELY TRYING TO SALVAGE HIS OPILIO SEASON. YOU GOT IT, MAN? TAKE HER AWAY. [ WINCH WHIRRING ] Keith: I CAN'T REMEMBER EVER HAVING THIS MANY COMPLICATIONS GOING INTO A SEASON. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE IT JUST KEEPS PILING UP AND PILING UP. I'M FEELING REALLY CREEPY ABOUT IT. AND I CAN'T SAY I'VE EVER HAD THAT FEELING IN MY LIFE WHERE I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE BOAT AND HANG OUT ON THE BOAT. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] WHEW. Narrator: TWO DAYS AGO, WHILE STEAMING TO THE CRAB GROUNDS... EVERYBODY OFF THE STACK IMMEDIATELY! ...A TOWERING 45-FOOT WALL OF WATER KNOCKED KEITH'S LITTLE BROTHER MONTE OUT OF COMMISSION. NOW THE WIZARD IS SHORTHANDED. BUT CAPTAIN KEITH HAS A PLAN. THE 49-YEAR-OLD FORMER WIZARD ENGINEER, LENNY LEKANOFF, HAS COME OUT OF RETIREMENT. ONE TRIP, THOUGH. THEN YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK. ALREADY GOING BACK TO WORK, BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS. AND DESPITE HIS SHATTERED CHEEKBONE, FIRST MATE GARY SOPER HAS DECIDED TO HELP HIS OLD FRIEND KEITH SAVE THE WIZARD'S SEASON. LeVeen: WELL, THE GOOD NEWS OF THE DAY IS THAT WE GOT GARY AND UNCLE LENNY BACK. SO, YEAH, WE'VE GOT A FULL CREW. AND WITH ANY LUCK, WE'LL BE DEPARTING FOR OUR FIRST REAL TRIP. Keith: HEY, LET THAT SPRING LINE GO, GUYS! IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING, BUT WE'RE FINALLY GETTING OUT OF HERE. [ AIR HISSES ] WELL, WE FINALLY MADE IT THROUGH ALL THE B.S. AND WE'RE READY TO START FISHING. [ SIZZLING ] Lofland: IDLE HANDS ARE THE WORKSHOP OF THE DEVIL. AND WE'VE HAD WAY TOO MUCH TIME OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS SEASON, THE WIZARD LEAVES THE SAFETY OF DUTCH HARBOR. BUT AS KEITH PLIES INTO THE UNKNOWN, THE WEIGHT OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY AS SKIPPER COMES CRASHING DOWN ON HIS SHOULDERS. Keith: I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT MY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. JUST ABORT! GET OFF THE STACK NOW! Narrator: AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, KEITH HAS STILL NOT BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE THE NIGHTMARE OF NEARLY LOSING HIS BROTHER AND CREW. ARE YOU WITH ME? [ SIGHS ] THAT'S GONNA BE GOING THROUGH MY HEAD FOR A LONG TIME. I'M GONNA QUESTION MY JUDGMENT ON BANGING UP THREE GUYS. Monte: IT GOT ME FROM BEHIND. I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT COMING. Soper: OH, I TOOK A HIT RIGHT HERE. OH, MAN, THAT HURT! RIGHT NOW, THE LAST THING I NEED IS TO BE SECOND-GUESSING MYSELF OUT HERE. I NEED TO FEEL CONFIDENT IN MY ABILITY AND MY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OUT HERE. I NEED TO KNOW THAT WHAT I'M DOING IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CREW, THE BOAT. I NEED TO KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THE BACK OF MY BRAIN, THAT I'M 100%. Narrator: 358 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE. A COUPLE HOURS AGO, THIS WAS A BIG FLOE. AND IT'S ALL COMING UNGLUED RIGHT NOW. WE'RE FISHING IN A DANGER ZONE. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU WANT GOOD NUMBERS, SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. THAT'S WHY, INSTEAD OF RUNNING FROM THE ICE, I USED TO GO LOOK FOR IT, 'CAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD LEAVE. AND I JUST FIGURED OUT HOW TO FISH IT. Narrator: BUT WITH THE ICE CLOSING IN ON HIS GEAR, PHIL WILL HAVE TO HUSTLE TO GET THROUGH THE LAST 120 POTS IN HIS NORTHERNMOST STRINGS. Phil: I'D LIKE TO PUT 50,000 POUNDS ON TODAY. ALL WE GOT TO DO TO GET 50,000 POUNDS OR OVER IS MAINTAIN A 350 AVERAGE. THAT'S A LOT EASIER SAID THAN DONE. BLOCK'S COMING UP TOO FAST. COME UP! YEAH! [ CHEERING ] YEAH! OH, YEAH. BRING IT AROUND! YEAH! SWEET! WHOO! WE ARE IN 'EM. Phil: THERE'S SOME CRAB IN IT, SO I MIGHT HAVE PULLED THIS OFF. THAT'S A GOOD POT RIGHT THERE, BABY. OH, YEAH. Narrator: THOUGH CAPTAIN PHIL WAS LATE TO START THE SEASON, THE GAMBLE TO FISH THE EDGE OF THE ICE PACK IS PAYING OFF IN SPADES. STUFFING THE TANKS. STUFFING THE TANKS. Phil: WE HAVE ALL FIVE POTS, AND WE WERE GETTING CONSISTENT 500s. IF WE CAN AVERAGE THIS ALL DAY LONG, WE'RE GONNA BE [BLEEP] IN TALL COTTON, FOR SURE. GEEZ. I DON'T THINK HE SKIPPED A HEARTBEAT. Narrator: BUT THE CELEBRATION IS SHORT-LIVED. [BLEEP] THEY'RE CALLING FOR 41' SEAS. Man: Gale warning for today. WELL, WHEN THEY'RE FORECASTING THAT MUCH WIND, YOU BETTER WORRY ABOUT IT. I MEAN, IF WE START GETTING WIND AND THEN THEY'RE FORECASTING 41-FOOT SEAS, IT'S [BLEEP] SERIOUS. IT'S "TAKE WINDOWS OUT" TIME. For today, northwest 30 knots. IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LATE TONIGHT. SO WE'RE GONNA HAUL GEAR UNTIL IT STARTS BLOWING, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TAKE OFF FOR THE BARN. WE'RE HOPING WE CAN HAUL ALL OUR GEAR, BUT I DON'T KNOW. I JUST -- IT COULD START BLOWING 15 MINUTES FROM NOW. AND WHENEVER IT STARTS BLOWING, WE'RE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Narrator: WITH NO TIME TO WASTE, PHIL SLAMS THE BOAT INTO HIGH GEAR. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] THE CREW RACES TO KEEP PACE. Phil: AND WE GOT TWO MORE POTS TO GO. Man: THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW A STORM'S A-BREWIN'. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] IT'S A-COMIN'. AND IT'S GONNA BE UGLY. Narrator: TIME BANDIT CAPTAIN ANDY HILLSTRAND ENTERS THE SAFETY OF ST. PAUL HARBOR JUST AN HOUR BEFORE HIS DELIVERY DEADLINE. HEY, ROGER, I WAS WONDERING IF IT'S OKAY TO COME IN THE HARBOR THIS MORNING. JANUARY 25th. PULLING INTO THE ST. PAUL HARBOR. FIRST TRIP OF THE SEASON OF '09. YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] Man: HOW WAS THE TRIP? SUCCESSFUL. TRIP WAS GOOD! Andy: I THINK I HAVE BETWEEN 90,000 AND 100,000 POUNDS ON BOARD. YEAH, BABY! Narrator: AFTER GRINDING FOR 20 HOURS STRAIGHT ON A MASSIVE VEIN OF OPILIO CRAB... YEAH! [BLEEP] ...CAPTAIN ANDY PLUGGED THE BOAT WITH 90,000 POUNDS. YEAH! Andy: ALL BECAUSE OF SOME LAST-MINUTE SHENANIGANS, WE PULL A RABBIT OUT OF OUR HAT. COMING ATCHA! PULLED IN WITH 36 MINUTES TO SPARE. Man: MORNIN'! THIS ONE SHOULD BE ABOUT HALF FULL. THEY LOOK ALIVE. THAT'S A GOOD THING. OKAY. GOOD NIGHT. GOING TO MY BUNK. Narrator: WHILE THE FIRST BRAILER IS OFF-LOADED, THE HAGGARD TIME BANDIT CREW FINALLY HITS THE RACKS FOR SOME WELL-EARNED SLEEP. OH, DUDE! TIRED. BUT IN THEIR HASTE TO GET TO BED, THE CREW FORGOT TO APPOINT SOMEONE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE WEIGH-IN. BY MORNING, THE CANNERY WORKERS ESTIMATE AN OFF-LOAD OF 85,000 POUNDS. BUT THE TIME BANDIT CREW HAS NO REAL WAY TO DOUBLE-CHECK THE FIGURES. Fourtner: SOMEBODY MUMBLED SOMETHING IN THE GALLEY ABOUT TAKING WEIGHTS, AND I NEVER HEARD NOTHING MORE ABOUT IT, SO... YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A COUPLE BRAILERS THAT YOU HAD A DOT BY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T RECORD? YEAH. DO THEY GET RECORDED NOW? NO, THEY GET RECORDED WHEN I TURN THE PAPERWORK IN. Narrator: JOHNATHAN CHECKS UP ON THE COUNTS... WHERE ARE WE AT NOW? I ONLY GOT -- Narrator: ...AND DISCOVERS THE CREW HAS LOST TRACK OF THE BRAILERS. 55, 56, 57, AND THAT'S 58. THERE'S ONLY 56 UP THERE, AND THESE ARE THE 2 MISSING ONES. HE SAID THEY'RE STILL MISSING TWO BRAILERS ON THAT COUNT. ARE WE ONLY TWO BRAILERS BEHIND? NO, THERE'S 57 AND 57 WRITTEN DOWN HERE. THAT'S 56. Narrator: IF THE COUNT IS OFF BY TWO BRAILERS, IT COULD ADD UP TO 4,000 POUNDS OF CRAB AND A LOSS OF $6,800. IF WE ALWAYS WRITE IT DOWN FOR OURSELVES, WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO GUESS. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. THAT'S WHY WE'LL NEVER DO THIS AGAIN. I'M SO [BLEEP] MAD THAT SOMEONE DIDN'T DO CRAB WEIGHTS. THERE'S LITTLE DOTS -- BUT I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT THOUGH, TOO. WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE IT BETTER, HONESTLY? GO DOWN THERE AND KICK THAT GUY RIGHT IN THE [BLEEP] 'CAUSE HE [BLEEP] JUST RIPPED YOU OFF. HE RIPPED YOU OFF FOR A COUPLE WEIGHTS. HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE MISSED FOREVER? BECAUSE THE NEXT ONE'S NUMBER 16. BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IT JUST DOESN'T GO TO THAT -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHY HE WRITES THEM DOWN HERE. WELL, DON'T ARGUE WITH HIM ABOUT IT. I KNOW. I AGREE WITH YOU! HELP ME OUT, DUDE! YOU SHOULD BE ON MY SIDE! I AM! I CAN'T TALK TO NOBODY ON THIS [BLEEP] BOAT, MAN. JOHNATHAN, I AM ON YOUR SIDE. HOW AM I NOT ON YOUR SIDE? THAT'S [BLEEP] -- YOU'RE CALLING ME OUT LIKE THAT. I'M CALLING YOU OUT, DUDE. YOU GO, "HEY, THEY [BLEEP] US BECAUSE --" I AGREE! I AGREE WITH YOU TOTALLY, 100%! WELL, THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU'RE SAYING THE GUYS HONESTLY WROTE DOWN EVERY WEIGHT. ON THE PRINTOUT, WE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL IF IT HAS THE $7,000. [ WHISTLING ] COME WITH ME. I'M GONNA GO TALK TO THAT GUY DIRECTLY RIGHT NOW. THE ONLY TWO THAT YOU THINK MIGHT NOT HAVE RECORDED ARE THESE TWO RIGHT HERE. EARLIER TODAY, YOU TOLD ME IT WAS FOUR. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. NO! DON'T -- DON'T PIN ANYTHING ON ME! SO IT COULD BE ONE OR TWO. THAT'S TWO. WE'RE TOTALLY AT HIS MERCY. WHAT'S AT HIS MERCY? THAT THESE WEIGHTS ARE WRONG? NO! THAT WHAT? WHATEVER HE SAYS IS WHAT WE HAVE. I'M THINKING WE GOT [BLEEP] RIGHT IN THE [BLEEP] I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THEY [BLEEP] US, AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY OR HOW THEY COULD OR THINK THAT GUY IS SUCH A GOOD GUY, HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO US. WE'RE NOT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE GUYS. NO, HE'S THE DEVIL. I FULLY AGREE. I AGREE. THE CANNERY IS ALWAYS THE DEVIL. Narrator: THE FINAL NUMBERS ARE IN, BUT THERE'S A 5,000-POUND DISCREPANCY. CAPTAIN ANDY CALLS THE CREW TO THE WHEELHOUSE. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, I'M TELLING EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW, WHENEVER THIS BOAT COMES IN, I WANT WEIGHTS TAKEN. WE'LL ALL GET IN THE HABIT OF IT. BUT WHEN ONE GUY DOESN'T DO IT, I GOT TWO SIGNS FOR YOU. I GOT THE "DON'T MAKE ME GO CAPTAIN ON YOUR ASS" SIGN. AND IF I'M REALLY MAD, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES, AND THEN I'LL [BLEEP] FIRE YOU. YOU'LL HAVE ONE WARNING. THE SECOND WARNING, YOU'LL HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO FIX IT. THEN YOU'RE FIRED. Narrator: CLOSING IN ON THE SOUTHERNMOST EDGE OF THE FISHING GROUNDS IS THE 155-FOOT WIZARD. Keith: I'M PSYCHED. I'M JACKED UP. I'M FEELING GOOD. I FEEL CONFIDENT. LET'S THROW THEM IN THE WATER AND GET THIS THING GOING. JUST GIVE ME A HINT OF SOME CRAB, AND LET'S START CHASING THEM. YOU GUYS READY TO ROLL? LET'S GO ALREADY! ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT. Narrator: THE FIRST POT IS SPLASHED, AND THE WIZARD'S OPILIO SEASON OFFICIALLY BEGINS... AND, HOPEFULLY, WITH THE WORST BEHIND THEM. YAR! WE BE FISHIN' TODAY! Keith: I'M GONNA COVER PROBABLY 15 MILES SOUTH OF WHERE I INTEND TO REALLY SET MY GEAR AND THEN PROBABLY GO BACK NORTH ANOTHER 5 TO 10 MILES NORTH OF WHERE THE MAJORITY OF MY GEAR WILL BE SET. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Narrator: BUT AS CAPTAIN KEITH PLOTS A COURSE FOR THE NORTH, HE DISCOVERS HE'S NOT ALONE. HOLY GUACAMOLE, WHAT'S SIG DOING IN MY HOLE? I'VE NEVER SEEN SIG FISH OVER HERE. IF HE'S OVER HERE, THAT MEANS THE WHOLE DAMN FLEET'S OVER HERE. THE ENTIRE TRIDENT FLEET IS HEADING TOWARDS THAT SPOT. [BLEEP] THAT JUST SUCKS. GOD, I WOULD HAVE BEEN FULL BY NOW. WOULD HAVE HAD THIS BOAT FULL. OBVIOUSLY, THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL. SUCKS BEING THE LAST ONE TO THE PARTY, I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. Narrator: CROWDED GROUNDS OR NOT, KEITH NEEDS TO GET HIS POTS FISHING. Keith: RIGHT NOW, I JUST WANT TO GET THE GEAR IN THE WATER AND START CATCHING SOME CRAB. AND THAT'S ALL I WANT TO THINK ABOUT. YOU GOT TO LEAVE ALL THAT OTHER GARBAGE ON THE DOCK. WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS GETTING THE BOAT OUT HERE AND GETTING THE BOAT BACK AND GETTING ALL THE GUYS BACK SAFE. Narrator: 380 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. AFTER AN HOUR STEAM, CAPTAIN SIG IS APPROACHING HIS NORTHERN STRINGS AND THE ICE PACK. THE ICE IS DEFINITELY MOVING SOUTH. YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF FIGURED WE HAD ENOUGH DISTANCE BETWEEN OUR GEAR AND THE ICE EDGE WHEN WE WENT IN. WHAT'S NOT SAFE IS, WHEN WE FISH IT, AND IF WE SEE CRAB, WE WANT TO FISH IT AGAIN. AND THE ICE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE DOWN TO THE ISLANDS. AND WHEN IT HITS THE ISLAND, THAT EDGE WILL PROBABLY BE VERY CLOSE TO OUR GEAR AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA PUSH IT. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU REALLY GOT TO WATCH THAT EDGE, SO IT'S GONNA BE A GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE THIS TIME FOR SURE. [ CLANGING ] Narrator: AS THEY STEAM NORTH, 15-FOOT SWELLS AND FREEZING SPRAY BATTER THE NORTHWESTERN, BUILDING A DANGEROUSLY THICK LAYER OF ICE ON THE DECK. AFTER FIVE SHORT HOURS OF BUNK TIME, THE NORTHWESTERN CREW WAKES UP TO MINUS-10-DEGREE TEMPERATURES AND AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE. WOW. THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUR PICK-AND-HOOK CABLE. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BAD OUT HERE. NOT NICE. Nick: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL, CRISP MORNING HERE IN THE BERING SEA. WE WOKE UP TO A NICE, LITTLE FROZEN DECK. YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FROZE. THE DECK HOSE IS FROZE. GOT COLD IN A HURRY, DIDN'T IT? Narrator: THE STEAM TO THE NORTH HAS COATED THE NORTHWESTERN IN OVER 6 INCHES OF ICE, ADDING OVER 30 TONS OF WEIGHT TO AN ALREADY HEAVY BOAT. IF THE ICE CONTINUES TO GROW, THE BOAT WILL BECOME TOP-HEAVY, ONE LARGE, UNSUSPECTING WAVE THAT HITS BROADSIDE COULD CAPSIZE THE VESSEL. SOME SPOTS ON THE BOAT, WE'VE MADE A COUPLE FEET OF ICE. WE'LL BREAK ICE HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. USE SLEDGEHAMMERS AND BATS, PIPES. Man: WHOA. Narrator: FOUR HOURS BREAKING ICE, AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING. THERE'S ICE RIGHT HERE. Narrator: THE PANCAKE ICE HAS A FLOE THAT'S BROKEN OFF FROM THE MAIN PACK JUST THREE MILES AWAY. IN ANOTHER HOUR, THE CREW WILL BE ON THE EDGE AND BEGIN HAULING 150 POTS. IF THEY'RE LUCKY, IT'LL ONLY TAKE ABOUT 30 HOURS. Sig: THE GEAR WAS FISHING REALLY FAST WHEN WE LEFT. SO IF WE CAN GET THOSE STEADY 500s, THAT'D BE GREAT. YOU KNOW, OUR GOAL IS TO GET THAT BACK TANK FULL ONE TIME THROUGH THE GEAR. IF WE CAN DO THAT, I'M ECSTATIC. Narrator: 335 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE WIZARD IS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH AN ARCTIC STORM FRONT. HUP! Man: 138. Narrator: AND WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST TO SLAM THE SOUTHERN GROUNDS WITHIN THE HOUR, CAPTAIN KEITH WILL NEED TO GET ALL 204 OF HIS POTS OFF THE BOAT. Keith: WE'RE INTO STRING NUMBER 4 NOW. WITH ANY LUCK, WE'LL HAVE 204 POTS OFF, AND WE'LL BE HAULING THEM AGAIN FROM START TO FINISH IN 12 HOURS TOTAL. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A SLOPPY RIDE UP TO THE NEXT SET. SHOULDN'T BE A PARADISE. A PRETTY MESSED-UP SENSE OF PARADISE. Narrator: ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN A WEEK SINCE THE WAVE BEAT UP HIS CREW, KEITH IS STILL RATTLED FROM THE ACCIDENT. OKAY, YOU GUYS, STAY SHARP ON THIS NEXT WAVE. Narrator: AND NOW WITH THE WEATHER RAPIDLY DETERIORATING, THE SKIPPER IS SECOND-GUESSING HIS DECISION TO FISH. I THINK I'M STILL A LITTLE BIT SHELL-SHOCKED. Narrator: 60-KNOT WINDS AND 25-FOOT SEAS BEGIN TO TEAR THROUGH THE GROUNDS. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] LeVeen: KEITH ENERGY -- IT'S KIND OF LIKE -- I THINK IT PROVIDES US WITH A LOT OF NERVOUS ENERGY. IT'S GONNA BE A REAL CRAPPY RIDE, SO WE'LL HAVE YOU GUYS HIDE OUT, ALL RIGHT? HOW WE DOING ON BAIT? I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT KEITH'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE BEING A CAPTAIN OF THIS BOAT AND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON. NOBODY GET NEAR THE RED ZONE OR THE RAIL. LAUNCHING. A LITTLE BIT JUMPY. I THOUGHT I LEFT THE BAGGAGE ON THE DOCK. I DON'T KNOW. SOPER, YOU NEED TO HAVE -- DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF FLOATATION ON UNDER THAT JACKET? SEE, THAT'S THE THING, IS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GUYS WILL DO. THEY START GETTING SLOPPY AND LAZY, AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, GO SPLASH-O. Narrator: ALTHOUGH THE CREW HAS RALLIED STRONG FOR 12 STRAIGHT HOURS... ...THE WEATHER IS EATING AWAY AT KEITH'S NERVES. I'M WAY TOO UPTIGHT FOR THE COURSE AND THE SET I'M ON RIGHT NOW, THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. DAMN IT! [BLEEP] Narrator: A SMALL, UNSUSPECTING WAVE KNOCKS LENNY OFF HIS FEET. HIS OLD FRIEND IS OKAY. BUT KEITH'S CONFIDENCE IS SHOT. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GONNA BE THE LAST ONE, THE ONE YOU'RE PUTTING IN THE RACK. DON'T PUT ANOTHER ONE IN, AND DON'T UNTIE THOSE POTS UP FORWARD. MAKE SURE THEY ALL HAVE A COUPLE OF TIES ON THEM. GOD, THEY JUST JUMP OUT OF NOWHERE, MAN, JUST OUT OF NOWHERE. SORRY ABOUT THAT. GO AHEAD AND DUMP IT. WELCOME BACK. Narrator: THE BATTLE-WEARY SKIPPER'S EDGE IS GONE. Narrator: 380 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT RETURNS TO THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THEIR FISHING GROUNDS AFTER OFF-LOADING $145,000 WORTH OF OPILIO CRAB. BUT FOR THE HILLSTRANDS, THE PAYDAY WAS BITTERSWEET. DURING THE OFF-LOAD, THE CREW NEGLECTED TO TRACK THE CRAB COUNT. WE WERE UP BY FIVE BRAILERS! NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY DON'T OWE US ANY! YEAH, AND WE'RE [BLEEP] Narrator: THE DECKHANDS' MISTAKE HAS COST THE HILLSTRANDS OVER $8,000. I CAN'T TALK TO NOBODY ON THIS [BLEEP] BOAT. OKAY, I'M TELLING EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW, WHENEVER THIS BOAT COMES IN, I WANT WEIGHTS TAKEN. BUT WHEN ONE GUY DOESN'T DO IT, I GOT TWO SIGNS FOR YOU. I GOT THE "DON'T MAKE ME GO CAPTAIN ON YOUR ASS" SIGN. AND IF I'M REALLY MAD, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES, AND THEN I'LL [BLEEP] FIRE YOU. ANDY GOT A LITTLE IRRITATED WITH US, YOU KNOW, OVER THE TAKING THE WEIGHTS THING. I GUESS THE FIRST THING WE DO IS GET A PAD AND A PENCIL AND TAKE WEIGHTS, YOU KNOW? AND THAT ALWAYS TURNS INTO -- THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A STANDARD DEAL ON A BOAT AS FAR AS I'VE KNOWN, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL THEM. I'VE ALREADY TOLD THEM, "YOU STEP UP OR YOU CAN STEP DOWN. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE." AND THEN AGAIN, BAIT SITUATION. YOU KNOW, I'VE WORKED ON DIFFERENT BOATS, YOU KNOW. AND THE BAIT SITUATION ON THIS BOAT IS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE SLOWEST OPERATIONS. WHAT'S SO SLOW ABOUT OUR BAIT OPERATION? WELL, WE'VE GOT THREE DIFFERENT BAIT STATIONS. I THINK THAT'S A WHINING [BLEEP] DEAL THERE IF YOU'RE [BLEEP] BITCHING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE NOT GONNA TRY ANYTHING NEW, THEN. I MEAN, YOU KNOW -- END OF SUBJECT. YEAH. DONE DEAL. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO PULL THEIR HEADS OUT OF THEIR [BLEEP] AND [BLEEP] WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM. Andy: JUST YELL AT ME  WHEN YOU'RE READY. ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO CRAB FISHING, MAN. Andy: WE'RE GONNA SHUFFLE ALL OF OUR GEAR AROUND, GO THROUGH ALL OF OUR GEAR. WE'RE GONNA RUN UP TOWARDS THE ICE, SEE HOW LONG WE HAVE TO FISH BEFORE WE GET WHACKED. I AM HOPING FOR 400 CRAB PER POT IN MY PROSPECT STRING... OR EVEN... EITHER ONE, MIKE! THE FIRST POT OF THE SECOND TRIP. HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE HER HALF FULL. AND IF WE DO, IT'S GONNA BE GOOD STUFF. HERE WE GO. COME ON! UH-OH. IT'S NOT VERY GOOD. NOT VERY GOOD. YEAH, IT IS. NO, IT AIN'T. GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! [ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] HOLY MOTHER! YEAH! YEAH! [ CHEERING ] YEAH, BABY! WHOO! [ LAUGHS ] ♪ CHICKA CHICKA CHICKA ♪ [ GRUNTING ] [ LAUGHS ] SOME GOOD FISHING HERE. IT'S WHAT EVERYBODY DREAMS ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE CRAB FISHING. 200s, 300s AIN'T ENOUGH. WE WANT TO SEE THOUSANDS. EVERYBODY DOES. ORANGE GOLD! THANK YOU! THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE. Johnathan: OH, YEAH, MAN, THAT'S BETTER! EVEN BETTER! Narrator: CAPTAIN ANDY HAS DIALED IN TO A HUGE OPILIO BIOMASS, OVER 700 KEEPERS PER POT. [ IMITATES GUITAR ] OWW! PARTY! [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH! PULL THEM FORWARD SOME. ALL RIGHTY! SICK! [ LAUGHS ] WE CALL IT 800, MR. 400 AVERAGE. 80 POTS LIKE THAT WILL FILL THAT BACK TANK. WE JUST KICKED SOME ASS! 712 AVERAGE. YEAH! THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT! Narrator: SIG'S GOT THE LEAD WHILE KEITH'S GOT NOTHING. Narrator: 275 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE CORNELIA MARIE. WE'VE BEEN DRIVING THROUGH THIS [BLEEP] NOW FOR 10 MINUTES. Narrator: CAPTAIN PHIL IS FIGHTING TOWARD ST. PAUL THROUGH MILES OF BOAT-CRUSHING ICE. [ THUMPING ] SON OF A [BLEEP] [ CRASHING ] THIS STUFF HERE, YOU HAVE TO REALLY BE CAREFUL. YOU COULD PUT A HOLE IN YOUR BOAT REAL EASY WITH THIS. Narrator: UNAWARE OF THE SITUATION, THE EXHAUSTED CREW IS SACKED OUT, RECOVERING FROM A 30-HOUR HAUL. PHIL'S NEW ENGINEER, STEVE, IS BELOW, KEEPING VIGIL. [ METAL CREAKING ] Phil: WE'RE ABOUT 10 MILES OUTSIDE OF ST. PAUL, AND THE ICE IS GETTING THICKER AND HARDER TO GET THROUGH. AND I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS FLOE. LIKE, I CAN'T FIND AN OPENING TO GET OUT OF IT. [ THUMPING ] THIS FLOE HERE IS BAD. IT'S GOT A BIG SWELL ON IT, AND IT'S JUST WIPING MY BOW OUT. Narrator: WHILE STEVE IS BELOW, HE DISCOVERS A LEAK IN THE CIRCULATION PIPES. IT'S NOT FROM THE HULL, BUT FROM A 4-INCH PIPE THAT FEEDS SEAWATER INTO THE PORT CRAB TANK. Steve: WELL, WE GOT A PIPE DOWN HERE LEAKING. BUT IT'S IN A BAD SPOT. COULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM, BUT I GOT TO TRY AND FIX IT. A TEMPORARY FIX SOMEHOW. WELL, I'M LUCKY I HAVE A LOT OF HORSEPOWER. I JUST GOT TO PUSH MY WAY THROUGH. I CAN FEEL ICE GOING UNDER THE WHEELS AND GETTING IN THE PROPELLERS. I MIGHT HAVE BENT ONE ALREADY. [ THUMPING CONTINUES ] Narrator: BELOW DECK, STEVE NEEDS TO CLEAR THE PIPE OF RUST AND CORROSION BEFORE HE CAN TRY TO WELD UP THE SMALL LEAK. THE SMALL LEAK JUST GOT BIGGER. [BLEEP] [ ALARM SOUNDING ] [ GROANS ] [BLEEP] HEY, PHIL, THIS PIPING UP HERE IN THE BOW IS LETTING GO. HEY, GO HELP STEVE, WOULD YOU? TELL JOSH HE NEEDS TO GET HIS ASS UP. AND DO IT NOW. [ ALARM CONTINUES ] JOSH, GET UP. I GOT TO GET SOMEBODY DOWN HERE LIKE RIGHT NOW. I NEED A RAG AND A SCREWDRIVER LIKE RIGHT NOW. HOW BIG? WANT A FLATHEAD? BIG FLATHEAD? YEAH, SOMETHING. WHAT DO YOU NEED? YOU GOT ANYTHING SMALLER? Narrator: CAPTAIN PHIL HANDS OVER THE HELM TO HIS YOUNGEST SON, JAKE. Jake: AHH. YEAH, YOU CAN SEE THE BIGGER STUFF. IT'S SO [BLEEP] SHUT THAT VALVE THERE. SHUT THIS VALVE HERE. SHUT THOSE VALVES THERE. YES, SIR. Narrator: PHIL GIVES THE ORDER TO KILL THE PUMPS THAT CIRCULATE WATER THROUGH THE TANKS AND KEEP THE CRAB ALIVE. BETTER TO RISK LOSING THE CRAB THAN TO RISK LOSING HIS BOAT. I AM JUST CONCERNED THAT THE METAL ON THIS PIPE IS TOO THIN. AS I WELD THIS PATCH IN THERE, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY IT'LL BLOW THROUGH THE PIPE BECAUSE THE METAL'S SO THIN. I MEAN, IF YOU BROKE THROUGH THIS ONE FROM HERE DOWN... THERE'S NO STOPPING IT. IT'D BE TIME TO BAIL. GRAB THE SURVIVAL SUITS AND THE EPIRB. I'D GRAB THAT THING AND DUCT-TAPE THAT TO MY LEG. GOT TO GET RID OF THE WATER.
