 Sig: THERE WAS QUITE A SWELL JUST RIGHT OFF THE BEACH. AT ABOUT 5:00 A.M., WE SNAPPED OUR ANCHOR LINE. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA SEE IF WE CAN'T RETRIEVE THIS ANCHOR. WE GOT TO BE REAL CAREFUL. IT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT. IT'S NOT THE ANCHOR THAT WEIGHS SO MUCH, IT'S THE CHAIN. AND IT'S THE CHAIN THAT HOLDS THE ANCHOR ON THE BOTTOM. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND DRAG FOR THE CABLE IF WE CAN. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF ON BOARD TO MAKE A DRAG HOOK, BUT WE GOT LUCKY. I WENT IN THE LAUNDERETTE AND I FOUND A PIECE OF STEEL WE USE FOR EMERGENCY STEERING. THAT IS JUST SWEET. GOT THE UGLIEST DRAG HOOK I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

 [ MAN LAUGHS ] Narrator: NOW, TO RETRIEVE THEIR $5,000 ANCHOR, EDGAR WILL TOSS HIS NEWLY FASHIONED GRAPPLING HOOK OVERBOARD, LET IT SINK 100 FEET TO THE BOTTOM, THEN DRAG IT BLINDLY IN THE BLOCK, HOPING TO SOMEHOW HOOK ON TO THE LOST ANCHOR CHAIN. ALL RIGHT. MOMENT OF TRUTH. WATCH YOUR -- JUST LAY IT ON THE EDGE. LET ME GET THAT LINE READY. GOT ONE SHOT ON THERE. Sig: UH-OH. YOU GOT SOMETHING THERE? I GOT SOMETHING! I'M GONNA HAVE TO BACK ON IT. PULL ON IT, THOUGH. KEEP IT TIGHT. THIS THING'S TIGHT, MAN. I THINK WE GOT IT. THAT WAS FAST. THAT WAS REALLY FAST. WE GOT SOMETHING. IF WE GET IT, DUDE, THAT IS REALLY GOOD. THAT IS REALLY GOOD. OH, IT'S A ONE-IN-A-MILLION, MAN. WE'LL SEE WHEN WE GET IT TO THE SURFACE. THERE'S A LOT OF [BLEEP] DOWN THERE WE COULD BE HOOKED INTO. Man: YEAH! [ CHEERING ] GOT IT! FIRST TRY, DUDE. [ EDGAR LAUGHS ] YES! BE CAREFUL, MAN. THERE'S A LOT OF STRAIN THERE. Edgar: GO AHEAD. PICK UP ON THE BLOCK. [ INDISTINCT YELLING ] Narrator: TO RELIEVE SOME OF THE TENSION ON THE BLOCK, EDGAR HOOKS THE CRANE TO THE LOOSE END OF THE 6,000-POUND CHAIN. Sig:  GET THAT ANCHOR OUT OF THERE. GET ON THE BLOCK! GET ON THE BLOCK! GO DOWN! DOWN! Sig: I'M DRIFTING. Narrator: BUT THE WEIGHT OF THE CHAIN IS TOO MUCH FOR THE LINE ON THE CRANE. Edgar: GET ON THE BLOCK! GET ON THE BLOCK! GO DOWN! Bradley: THERE WAS A LOT OF TENSION ON THE LINE. IT JUST SNAPPED THE CRAB LINE THAT WE JUST HAD HOOKED ON TO IT LIKE A DRY PIECE OF WOOD. IT TAKES A LOT TO MAKE ME NERVOUS. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE LIFE, MAN. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. Edgar: YOU GOT TO START TURNING, BRO. JUST SLACK IT OFF.  SLACK IT -- WHATEVER. YOU GOT TO TURN! I GOT TO DUMP THIS HERE. BACK IT OFF! BACK IT OFF! BACK IT OFF. BACK IT OFF. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I WANTED YOU TO TIE THAT OFF TO THE LEFT! LOOK AT THIS! Narrator: THE STRONG CURRENT BEGINS PUSHING THE NORTHWESTERN AWAY FROM THE ANCHOR. TRY TO TURN THE BOAT! AND WITHIN SECONDS, SHE BEGINS LISTING DANGEROUSLY TO STARBOARD. STAND THERE YELLING AT US! DO SOMETHING! I WOULD SLACK OFF ON THE BOOM! SLACK OFF ON THE BOOM!  PULL IN ON THE BLOCK! PULL IN ON THE CRAB BLOCK! [ ROPES CREAKING ] WHOO... HOO. OH, MY -- OH [BLEEP] YOU GUYS. ADAM! PUT THE BOAT IN GEAR, DUDE! WELL, SLACK OFF, AND LET ME COME AROUND, THEN. SLACK OFF! SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THAT A LONG TIME AGO. I ASKED YOU THREE TIMES TO PLEASE... [ Slowly ] TIE THE CHAIN TO THE RACK. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. OKAY, I'M DRIFTING OVER IT NOW,  SO WHATEVER YOU DO... Narrator: EDGAR QUICKLY LASHES THE CHAIN TO THE POT LAUNCHER TO RELIEVE THE STRAIN ON THE BLOCK. Sig: NO, YOU OWN IT.  IT'S YOURS. WE CAN DRIFT OUT TO SEA  WITH THIS RIGHT NOW. WHOA! Edgar: IT'S GOING FORWARD. PUT IT IN GEAR AND TURN. ALL RIGHT. GET BACK IN. GIVE ME THAT SHACKLE. GIVE ME THAT SHACKLE. GIVE ME THAT CHAIN. Narrator: EDGAR FINALLY MANAGES TO ATTACH A HEAVY STEEL LINE FROM THE ANCHOR WINCH TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN. STAND BACK. USE A HATCHET! YOU'RE GOOD.  CUT IT. BRING IT UP. WAY TO GO.  ALL RIGHT. HERE COMES THE CHAIN. NICE! Narrator: AFTER FOUR HOURS AND A FEW NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES, THE NORTHWESTERN CREW HAS THEIR ANCHOR BACK WHERE IT BELONGS. YES! OH, YEAH! GOOD GRIEF. Narrator: 38 MILES TO THE NORTH, ON THE TIME BANDIT... PULLING INTO ST. PAUL HARBOR. SPINNING AROUND, GOING TO THE NORTH DOCK. JUST GOT TO TURN AROUND! Narrator: WITH NEAL HILLSTRAND OFFICIALLY RETIRED FROM THE DECK, TO PICK UP THE SLACK, THEY'VE HIRED 26-YEAR-OLD GREENHORN EARON OVERSON. COME ON IN, NEW GUY! NEW GUY? HA HA! [ CHUCKLES ] THE USUAL SUSPECTS. HOW YOU DOING, JOHN? SO YOU JUST DO TWO SLITS -- SHH! SHH! -- DOWN BOTH SIDES, AND THEN THAT'S HOW WE STRING THEM UP. Narrator: AS THEY LEAVE PORT, SCOTTY HILLSTRAND GIVES THE HORN THE 10-CENT TOUR... Scott: SO NEVER DO NOTHING BY YOURSELF. WE ALL WANT TO GO HOME IN ONE PIECE. ...AND POINTS OUT THE  TIME BANDIT'S BEST-KEPT SECRET. AND IF YOU EVER GET REALLY COLD, WE GOT A SAUNA RIGHT HERE. IF YOU WANT TO RELAX AND SOAK YOUR ACHING BONES, YOU JUMP IN THERE. IT'S ALWAYS ON. [ COUGHS ] YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF THINGS QUICK, THOUGH, I'M SURE. COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... [ SIREN WAILS ] A PIPE HAS BURST IN THE ENGINE ROOM. WHERE'S MY OTHER SET OF [BLEEP] HANDS?! Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO, IN THE MIDST OF AN ARCTIC STORM, A SERIES OF ROGUE WAVES TORE THROUGH THE FLEET... Man: WHOO! Narrator: ...LEAVING A PATH OF DESTRUCTION IN HER WAKE. BUT ON THE CORNELIA MARIE... AAH! Narrator: ...IT WAS CAPTAIN PHIL THAT TOOK THE HARDEST HIT OF THEM ALL. I CAME FLYING OUT OF BED, LANDED UP AGAINST THAT, AND I CRACKED MY RIBS. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME TRYING TO BREATHE. WITH POSSIBLE BROKEN RIBS... [ COUGHS ] ...BLOOD IN HIS LUNGS, AND BARELY ABLE TO BREATHE... ...PHIL HEADS INTO PORT. BUT THE LOCAL CLINIC WASN'T EQUIPPED FOR PHIL. JUST TELL ME THIS -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIAGNOSE IT, BUT DO YOU SEE A PROBLEM HERE? YEAH. THE ONLY CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL WAS THE HOSPITAL IN ANCHORAGE. I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. BUT IT IS, AND I'M HERE. Narrator: NOW, WITH CAPTAIN PHIL'S FATE STILL AN UNKNOWN, 750 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST ON ST. PAUL ISLAND... WITH THE OFF-LOAD NEARLY COMPLETE, PHIL'S CREW FACES THE COLD REALITY THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO HEAD TO SEA WITHOUT THEIR TRUSTED SKIPPER AND FATHER. IT'S WEIRD TO SEE, LIKE, SOMEONE THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS SO INVINCIBLE [BLEEP] FIND OUT THEY AIN'T THAT INVINCIBLE. HE'S LEAVING THE BOAT, AND HE'S NOT FEELING WELL. AND I DON'T MEAN JUST NOT FEELING WELL. HE'S GOT SOME ILLNESS, AND THAT BOTHERS ME. Narrator: PHIL'S ENTRUSTED MURRAY GAMRATH TO TAKE OVER HIS MILLION-DOLLAR OPERATION. AND SINCE THEY'LL NEED ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET, 34-YEAR-OLD GREENHORN DAN DECKER JOINS THE CREW. BUDDY. YEAH. Maugatai: IT'S ALL ABOUT DUE RESPECT, YOU KNOW? IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB, THAT'S RESPECT RIGHT THERE. HE'LL CONTINUE TO SHAKE YOUR HAND. HEADS UP. JUST PLOP YOUR BAGS RIGHT THERE FOR NOW. THAT'LL BE YOUR BUNK THERE WHEN I GET MY STUFF OUT. Gamrath: WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA RUN HIM INTO THE GROUND. BUT AS LONG AS HE LASTS FOR A TRIP, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. WE'RE GONNA GO HIT THIS HARD, AND I'M GONNA LOAD THIS BOAT. THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN HERE SHORTLY. WE REALLY NEED TO GET THIS BOAT LOADED. Narrator: WITH THE LAST OF THE CRAB OUT OF THE TANKS, THE CREW TENDS TO THE LAST OF THEIR DUTIES BEFORE LEAVING PORT. I'M JUST GONNA SET THIS OVER HERE. IT HASN'T JUST BEEN A LONG COUPLE DAYS, IT'S BEEN A LONG,  EMOTIONAL COUPLE DAYS. AND THAT TAKES A TOLL ON EVERYBODY -- THE BOYS, ESPECIALLY. ONCE THEY GET A CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR FATHER, UM... THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE A HUGE RELIEF, YOU KNOW? ESPECIALLY JOSH -- AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD REASON RIGHT NOW WHY HE'S, YOU KNOW, JUST PHYSICALLY OUT. IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICALLY, IT'S MENTAL, YOU KNOW? Narrator: 50 MILES TO THE SOUTH, THE 155-FOOT WIZARD, STUFFED TO THE BRIM WITH OVER 400,000 POUNDS OF OPIES, HEADS TO PORT FOR AN OFF-LOAD. WE'RE ON REALLY GOOD FISHING. WE MANAGED TO SCOOP UP A FULL TRIP OF CRAB, AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG PICK SITTING IN THE GEAR WHEN WE GET BACK OUT. Narrator: AFTER THREE DAYS OF NONSTOP FISHING, THE CREW COLLAPSES. [ SIREN WAILS ] HANG ON A SECOND. Lekanoff: I HAVE A LEAK IN THE ENGINE ROOM. NEED HELP DOWN THERE. Keith: TAKE THE WHEEL! TAKE THE WHEEL! GRAB THE DAMAGE-CONTROL KIT FOR ME, OKAY? GOTCHA. WHERE'S MY OTHER SET OF [BLEEP] HANDS?! Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH GRABS THE CLOSEST SET OF RAIN GEAR TO COVER THE HOLE, BUT SEAWATER CONTINUES TO POUR INTO THE BILGE. HAD A SPLIT IN THE CRAB PIPE -- BIG SUPPLY LINE. Narrator: THE PIPE THAT CIRCULATES FRESH OCEAN WATER TO THE CRAB TANKS HAS BURST. KEITH BEGINS CUTTING STRIPS OF RUBBER WHILE MONTE AND LENNY PUT PIPE CLAMPS IN PLACE. WE'RE NOT GIVING ANY WATER TO THE CRAB IN THE STARBOARD-AFT TANK. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE FLOODING OUR ENGINE-ROOM BILGE, THOUGH. WE GOT TO GET THIS TO STOP! Keith: GET ALL THIS [BLEEP] OUT OF MY WAY! ALL THE WAY OUT! Narrator: IF THE LEAK CAN'T BE STOPPED, KEITH WILL BE FORCED TO SHUT THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM DOWN, AND SEAWATER WILL SLOWLY DRAIN FROM HIS AFT TANK. WE COULD LOSE $250,000 WORTH OF CRAB. HEY, KID! I'M GONNA HAVE YOU GO CHECK. GO LOOK IN THE STARBOARD-AFT TANK AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER'S ON THE CRABS AND GET BACK TO ME A.S.A.P. Narrator: THE KID CHECKS TO SEE HOW FAR THE LEVEL OF WATER HAS DROPPED IN THE TANK. Man: I GUESS THE WATER'S GOING DOWN. IT'S DOWN ABOUT A FOOT NOW. STEVE! IT'S DOWN THAT FAR. JUST TO THE CRAB. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE RUBBER. LET ME PUT ONE MORE WRAP ON IT DOWN LOW HERE. Narrator: ALTHOUGH THE QUICK PATCH IS HOLDING, THE TRUE TEST IS TURNING ON THE HIGH-PRESSURE PUMP. [ AIR HISSES ] NOW THE MOMENT OF TRUTH. Man: WHOO! [ LAUGHS ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID, BUT... ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE THAT PATCH JOB IS GONNA BE ENOUGH TO GET US TO TOWN AND KEEP THESE GUYS ALIVE. Narrator: COMING UP... THE NEW SKIPPER SPENDS HIS FIRST DAY IN THE BIG CHAIR. YEE-HAW. [BLEEP] Narrator: 315 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, AS THE TIME BANDIT APPROACHES HER GROUNDS, CAPTAIN ANDY GIVES THE NEW KID A FEW WORDS OF CAUTION. HEY, DUDE, JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. DON'T, LIKE [BLEEP] JUMP IN AND TRY AND BE A HERO, SAVE NOTHING. THEY'LL SHOW YOU WHAT'S GOING ON, AND THERE'S GONNA BE A [BLEEP] OF CRAB TO SORT. SO YOU'LL CATCH ON. OKAY, BUDDY. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE WATCHING YOU, MAN. EARON DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO YET. THIS ALL DEPENDS ON HOW WELL THEY TRY TO HELP HIM OUT OR IF THEY TRY TO SEE HIM STRUGGLE. I HAVE NEVER FISHED OUT IN THE BERING SEA. BLUE TOTE? HE'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. YOU PROBABLY SEE HIM. Andy: I CAN'T SEE NOTHING. ONE -- IT'S 11:00. OH, I SEE. THERE, YEAH. FIRST CRAB POT. 10:00 A.M. Narrator: THE 26-YEAR-OLD GREENHORN IS ABOUT TO GET SCHOOLED BY SENIOR DECKHAND RUSS NEWBERRY. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] OH, YEAH, BABY! EACH LEGAL ADULT MALE IS 4-INCHES ACROSS AT ITS WIDEST POINT. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE  NOT LOOKING FOR. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S PLENTY BIG ENOUGH. PLENTY BIG ENOUGH. AND WE'RE NOT IN A HURRY. WELL, WE ARE, BUT... THIS IS LIKE A GIANT JIGSAW PUZZLE, EARON. START FLIPPING THEM OVER. RIGHT HERE IN YOUR LITTLE AREA -- NOT IN THE MIDDLE. WE'RE TRYING TO WORK FROM THE EDGES TO THE MIDDLE -- THAT WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] Man: OH! I KNOW YOU CAN PUT THEM IN THERE ONE AT A TIME, BUT I WANT YOUR EYE TO GET GOOD TO BE ABLE TO PICK OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT... RIGHT. ...AND THAT. HUGE DIFFERENCE. YOU KNOW, DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TO THINK ABOUT IT. RIGHT. GOT TO GET AN EYE FOR IT. YOU'RE GETTING A LOT FASTER WITH THEM -- THAT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S NOT A... IT'S A "DA-DA-DA!" HE'S GONNA LEARN IN 2 1/2 DAYS HOW TO LOAD THIS BOAT, WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT. Narrator: 150 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST, THE CORNELIA MARIE APPROACHES THEIR FIRST STRING WITHOUT CAPTAIN PHIL AT THE HELM IN OVER 17 YEARS. FOR MURRAY, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RUNNING THE BOAT AND KEEPING PHIL'S SONS SAFE IS SETTING IN. Gamrath: IT'S BEEN A COUPLE YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN UP HERE, YOU KNOW? JUST LIKE RIDING A BICYCLE, YOU NEVER FORGET HOW. Narrator: WHILE MURRAY ADJUSTS TO THE WHEELHOUSE, DOWN ON DECK, THE GREENHORN BEGINS HIS FIRST DAY UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF THE HARRIS BOYS. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO NOW, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. YOU'LL TELL ME. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. YOU'LL TELL ME IF I'M [BLEEP] UP OR WHATEVER. TEST IS COMING RIGHT NOW -- THIS STRING. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE GUY'S MADE OF. THIS GOES UP FIRST, HE GRABS IT, PUT THIS IN. YEP. YEAH, BABY! HOP IN THERE! HOP IN THERE! WHAT'S THAT? SIT ON YOUR BUTT. GET ALL THE WAY IN THERE AND SIT ON YOUR BUTT. JUST PUT IT THIS WAY. YEAH. THERE YOU GO. Gamrath: FULL TOTE OF 200. THAT'S ABOUT 300 POUNDS EACH TIME YOU PUSH ONE BACK ON THE DECK. A LOT OF WORK WORKING ON ONE OF THESE DECKS -- ESPECIALLY THIS LENGTH OF DECK. SO FAR, HE'S SLOW AS [BLEEP] Gamrath: WELL, THE CURRENT'S JUST RUNNING RIGHT NOW FROM THE NORTHEAST TO THE SOUTHWEST, PUSHING RIGHT UP, JUST MAKING EVERYTHING REALLY STEEP. YEE-HAW. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] Man: WHOO! Man: WHOO! Narrator: AS A 20-FOOT WAVE BLINDSIDES HALF THE CREW, FREDDY STANDS SOLID AND HOLDS THE POT FROM FLYING OFF THE RACK. THAT'S PART OF THE JOB. YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU LOOK OUT FOR YOUR BROTHERS, YOU KNOW? DON'T WANT TO GET HURT. SORRY, GUYS. I DIDN'T THINK  THAT WAS GONNA COME OVER. THAT COULD'VE BEEN A KILLER FOR ME. THAT POT COULD'VE EASILY PUSHED ME OFF THE SIDE OF IT AND LANDED RIGHT ON TOP OF ME. I'M REALLY LUCKY. Man: YEE-HAW! Narrator: ABOVE FATE, THE GREENHORN'S FIRST JOB IS TO ADJUST TO THE FAST AND FURIOUS PACE OF THE CORNELIA MARIE DECK. 400 ON THAT ONE. STARTING OFF THE DAY PRETTY GOOD HERE. LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING REALLY GOOD. Josh: JUST DO ONE SIDE AT A TIME. EASY, NOW. SORRY. KICK IT DOWN WITH YOUR LEGS. HOLD ON TO THAT UPPER BAR. Narrator: 10 POTS INTO THE STRING, THE CREW IS STARTING TO GET A RHYTHM GOING -- EVEN THEIR NEW GREENHORN, DAN. Jake: TELLING ME HE HOPES HE MAKES IT 40 POTS. AND I'M GOING, "WE BETTER HOPE HE MAKES LIKE 130 POTS." [ GRUNTS ] GET THAT? OH, NO WAY. Jake: WHAT JUST HAPPENED, DAN? Gamrath: WELL, IF ANYBODY STEPS IN THE TANK ON THIS BOAT, THEY OWE EVERYBODY ON THE BOAT A CASE OF BEER. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S A CASE OF BEER. THAT'S OUR COUNT. CASE OF BEER! THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THE BEER, THOUGH. I BROUGHT IT IN ADVANCE. Maugatai: HE'S BEEN PRETTY GOOD. HE'LL COME AROUND, YOU KNOW? EVERYBODY NEEDS THE CHANCE, YOU KNOW? IT WAS JUST LIKE ME, TOO, ON MY FIRST TIME, YOU KNOW? SO I WAS ON THE WAY, TOO, SO... TAKE TIME. HE'S A GOOD KID. GOOD GUY. Narrator: NEXT... A PHONE CALL FROM THE DARK. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] PHIL: I'll tell you what happened. There's been some developments since last night that'll just blow you away. MY MOM JUST DIED OF THIS. Narrator: 281 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR... Man: WHOA! WE GOT IT! WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO! HE'S BEEN PUSHING A LOT OF TOTES, HUSTLING, RUNNING. IT'S THIS WHOLE, LIKE... PHYSICAL-MENTAL BALANCE. MY BODY'S DONE. NOW I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE MY MENTAL KEEP WORKING. NICE JOB, GUYS. JUST DO ME A FAVOR AND SHUT THE HYDRANTS OFF THERE, DAVE, WHEN YOU COME IN, AND I'LL DO THE REST. Narrator: AFTER THROWING ABOARD NEARLY 36,000 POUNDS, CORNELIA MARIE RELIEF SKIPPER MURRAY GAMRATH GIVES THE CREW A FOUR-HOUR BREAK. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] PHIL, IT'S MURRAY. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? PHIL: Well, I'll tell you what happened. There's been some developments since last night that'll just blow you away. The doctor, he's really thorough. WHAT HE TELLS ME IS I HAD A GREAT BIG, HUGE BLOOD CLOT GO FROM MY LEGS, all the way up, went through my heart, AND LANDED ON MY LUNG. WOW. I don't know if you understand what that means, BUT IT'S NOT GOOD. YOU COULD HAVE DIED FROM THAT. No [bleep] But getting hit by the wall on the boat WAS JUST KIND OF A FREAK THING, because this other deal is what's causing probably 80% of what's going on with me. NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT IF THERE'S ANY MORE BLOOD CLOTS -- MY MOM JUST DIED OF THIS. ONE WENT FROM HER LEG, AND IT GOES UP AND GOES THROUGH YOUR HEART, and one little part of it -- of the blood clot -- comes off, and it plugs out your dealing heart, AND BOOM, YOU'RE DEAD. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE. WHOA. AS FAR AS HAVING A MARK ON MY LUNG, HE SAYS, "YOUR LUNGS ARE FINE." WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. I'M GONNA BE HERE IN ICU FOR -- I DON'T KNOW. IT'S GONNA BE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. HI, GIRLS. I THINK THEY'RE GONNA STAB ME AGAIN HERE. OH, MAN. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A SHOUT HERE. Okay. [ TELEPHONE BEEPS ] WOW! JOSH. JAKE. I WANT YOU GUYS BOTH TO WAKE UP, AND I'LL TALK TO YOU HERE IN TWO SECONDS. I'M NOT GONNA START BLABBING TO YOU. I JUST WOKE YOU UP. GO AHEAD AND WAKE UP, GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE, COME UP AND MEET ME IN THE WHEELHOUSE. [ COUGHS ] ARE YOU SEMI-AWAKE THERE? I GOT SOME GREAT NEWS. YOUR DAD ACTUALLY WAS INCREDIBLY LUCKY. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED NORMALLY KILLS MOST PEOPLE, SO SOMEBODY WAS LOOKING OUT AFTER HIM. HE HAD A BLOOD CLOT IN HIS LEG. IT PASSED THROUGH HIS HEART... AND ENDED UP IN HIS LUNGS. THAT'S WHERE THE BLOOD CAME FROM. THAT'S WHY THEY TELL PEOPLE TO STAND UP AND WALK AROUND BEFORE THEY GET ON PLANES AND STUFF LIKE THAT OR ARE SITTING IN AREAS FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THAT IS THE SPOT THAT WAS IN HIS LUNGS. OKAY? YEAH. IT'S NOT THE WORST OF WHAT WE WERE THINKING, OKAY? WOW. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR. IT'S GOOD NEWS. TODAY IS ALREADY A BRIGHT, SHINY MORNING. THE SUN HASN'T EVEN POPPED UP YET. SO IT'S GOOD NEWS TO HEAR. I GOT THE PHONE NUMBER HERE. LET'S GIVE HIM A CALL RIGHT NOW. I GOT JOSH AND JAKE UP HERE. THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. SO I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW I'M SO HAPPY, BUD. PHIL: The night that I was shaking so bad and I was gasping for air and I was shaking like a leaf -- I mean violently -- it was almost like a seizure -- That was when it was going in my lung and my heart and starting to close off stuff and open other stuff up. And, you know, it's just a miracle. HELL, YEAH, DUDE. THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS. THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS, DAD. WHAT'S UP, POPS? WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY? Trying to get myself better to get back on that boat. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. WE'RE ALL COUNTING OUR BLESSINGS ON THE BOAT HERE. But if you call every little bit -- maybe once a day or so, it sure helps. I enjoy hearing somebody. ALL RIGHT, DUDE. WELL... HEY, I LOVE YOU, TOO. WE'RE GONNA GO GET A LITTLE CRABBY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. OKAY. BYE-BYE. [ SIGHS ] Narrator: 270 MILES SOUTHEAST FROM THE CRAB GROUNDS, THE NORTH AMERICAN ARRIVES IN DUTCH HARBOR TO OFF-LOAD IN THE MIDDLE OF A WINTER STORM. Sten: THIS IS NOT A VERY NICE CONDITION TO BE MOVING THE BOAT. I DON'T LIKE MOVING THE BOAT IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER. IT'S BLOWING EAST 55 RIGHT NOW. THE WIND JUST WILL PUSH THE BOAT LIKE A SAIL. IT'S COLD AS HELL, MAN. Sten: SEE THE MAVERICK BACK THERE? IT'S JUST GETTING POUNDED BY THE EASTERLY WIND BECAUSE HE'S LAYING SIDEWAYS, AND THE WIND IS JUST PUSHING HIM INTO THE DOCK. Narrator: ICE 2 FEET THICK HAS ALREADY FORMED AT THE DOCK. OH, GOD. THIS IS CRAZY, MAN. Man: WATCH YOURSELF. Sten: PUT THE STRAIN ON THE OTHER LINE. I WANT THE STRAIN ON THE HEAVIER LINE. Sten: PULL UP. PULL UP.  PULL UP. PICK IT UP NOW.  PICK IT UP. Narrator: AFTER FIGHTING ICE, HEAVY CURRENTS, AND WIND, THE NORTH AMERICAN IS SAFELY TIED UP AT THE DOCK. THE OFF-LOAD CAN BEGIN. BUT BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS, THE PROCESS WILL BE A SLOW ONE. Man: DUMP IT IN! COME ON! Narrator: AFTER 18 SLOW HOURS, THE OFF-LOAD IS COMPLETE. NOW THE CREW RACES TO FIX THE MANGLED DECK BEFORE ANOTHER SQUALL BLOWS IN. Sten: WE'RE GETTING STARTED ON THAT DECK REPAIR, PROBABLY SPEND ALL DAY WORKING ON THE DECK, AND HOPEFULLY GET THIS DECK DONE BY TONIGHT AND BE READY TO SAIL OUT IN THE MORNING. Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO, THE ROGUE WAVE FELT 'ROUND THE FLEET RIPPED APART THE ENTIRE BACK DECK. ON THE WAY IN, WE WERE RIDING SO LOW IN THE WATER. WE HAVE A LOT OF FUEL ON BOARD, WE HAD A WHOLE LOAD OF CRAB, SO WE WERE JUST REALLY DIPPING INTO THOSE WAVES. THE WHOLE STERN ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE A BATHTUB -- JUST FILLED RIGHT UP. [ BELL CLANGING ] Arket: WE'RE PUTTING IN THE LAST BOARD RIGHT NOW. I'M JUST GONNA GO RIGHT IN. IT'S GONNA SPLIT THE WOOD ANYWAY, 'CAUSE THE WOOD'S ROTTEN. TEMPORARY FIX. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE IT LAST THREE DAYS. Narrator: BUT THE DECK MAY LAST LONGER THAN GREENHORN DEBO AFTER THE PHYSICAL BEATING HE TOOK ON HIS FIRST TRIP. Man: OH! MAN DOWN! Labay: I WANT TO SHOW THESE GUYS THAT I CAN DO THIS. AND IF I DO THAT, THEY'RE GONNA WANT ME BACK FOR KING CRAB, YOU KNOW? I THINK IT'S GONNA GO GOOD, MAN. Narrator: DEBO WILL HAVE TO SUCK IT UP FOR ONE MORE TRIP BEFORE CAPTAIN STEN DECIDES HIS FATE. COMING UP, TWO GREENHORNS TAKE ON THE RAIL... I THINK I CAN GET IT, YOU KNOW? ...A GUT-WRENCHING CHALLENGE. Narrator: 285 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, NORTH AMERICAN CAPTAIN STEN SKAAR HAS DECIDED TO PUT HIS GREENHORN TO THE TEST. WE HAD THAT CHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, SO DO IT, OKAY? TODAY DEBO WILL WORK THE RAIL FOR THE FIRST TIME. Sten: WE'LL SEE HOW HE FARES. I'VE ADDED A LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIM. HE'S GONNA BE AT THE RAIL. IT'S DANGEROUS ON THE RAIL. HE KNOWS WHAT HIS TASK IS AHEAD, AND HE KNOWS HIS JOB AND WHAT HE'S EXPECTED TO DO. ONE MORE THING THAN I HAD TO DO LAST TRIP, SO I'M JUST GONNA PREPARE MYSELF, MAKE IT EASY ON MYSELF. THEY WANTED ME TO GIVE THIS TO YOU. Narrator: AND WHILE DEBO WORKS THE RAIL, HE'LL HAVE TO WEAR THE TRADITIONAL NORWEGIAN HORNS, PER CAPTAIN'S ORDERS. AS HE PUSHES, YOU'LL PUSH OUT. OKAY. COMES IN, GRAB AHOLD, AND PULL REAL TIGHT. USE YOUR LEGS, TOO. OKAY. COMES UP, PULL IN, GRAB. MAKE SURE YOUR LEGS ARE AWAY, 'CAUSE IT'LL COME OUT. IF IT COMES OUT, HITS YOU IN THE LEG, YOU'RE DONE. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CLIMB UP HERE. PULL THIS OUT. OUT THEY GO. I THINK I CAN GET IT, YOU KNOW? I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT YOU GOT TO LEARN, YOU KNOW? HERE IT COMES! HE'S GOT IT. MAYBE NOT. MAYBE NOT. ALL RIGHT. THAT'LL WORK. THAT'LL WORK. ALL RIGHT. GIVE IT A GRAB. ALL RIGHT. PULL IT IN. PULL IT IN. OH, NEVER LET GO. NEVER LET GO. DON'T LET GO OF IT WHEN IT'S ON BOARD LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, GET READY. ALL RIGHT, PULL IT. PULL IT. PULL IT OUT AND THEN PULL THE DOOR UP. ONE MORE TIME. YOU GOT TO PULL IT OUT. OHH! Narrator: ALTHOUGH DEBO'S PUTTING HIS BEST FOOT FORWARD, THE CREW QUESTIONS THE CAPTAIN'S DECISION TO PUT A HORN ON THE RAIL. HE'S JUST GONNA GET HURT, THEN STEN'S GONNA END UP REGRETTING IT. BAD TIMING TO PUT THAT GREENHORN ON THE RAIL TODAY. OH, ABSOLUTELY. HE CAN BARELY DO HIS BAIT, LET ALONE LAND THE POT. I THINK IT WAS A STUPID DECISION, AND I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD DO IT. DOING A GOOD JOB. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. HANG ON TO IT. HANG ON TO IT. Kvinge: THAT'S NOT SAFE HAVING A GUY WHO'S SCARED TO DEATH. HE'S TOO SHORT FOR THE JOB AND TOO INEXPERIENCED. HAS NO IDEA. AND IF ONE GUY GETS HURT AND WE HAVE TO GO TO TOWN, EVERYTHING'S SCREWED UP. Sten: I THINK HE'S READY FOR THE TASK. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL PASS IT, BUT IT'S ABOUT TIME HE'S CHALLENGED A LITTLE BIT MORE. Narrator: 99 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST ABOARD THE TIME BANDIT, JUST LIKE DEBO, GREENHORN EARON IS TESTED AT THE RAIL. YOU OPEN THE DOOR, FLIP THE DOOR OPEN, HOLD IT UP, PULL THE BAIT OUT, AND THEN I'LL HAND YOU A BAIT. YOU JUMP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POT, THEN YOU PULL THAT AND SNAP THE CLIP ON. PUSH IT OVER THAT ONE. THERE YOU GO. Scott: NOW PULL IT TIGHT. PULL IT TIGHT. NOW YOU JUST FLIP THE DOOR. YOU GO THROUGH THIS WAY, DO AN UNDERHAND. TRY NOT TO LET THEM GET TWISTED AND STUFF, YOU KNOW? OKAY. I TRY TO GRAB TWO OF THEM AT A TIME, SNAP THE LIDS, THEN YOU RUN OVER THERE, FILL THEM UP. Scott: UNDER IT. YEAH. I THINK THE GREENHORN'S GONNA WORK OUT. ONCE HE PUKES HIS GUTS OUT. WELL, HE'LL JUST THROW UP, THEN GET USED TO IT. OR HE'LL STAY SICK AND WON'T MAKE THE CUT. IT TASTED BETTER GOING DOWN THAN IT DID COMING BACK UP. Narrator: ON THE NORTH AMERICAN, DEBO'S DAY JUST ISN'T GETTING ANY BETTER. Kvinge: HE'S SLOWING DOWN. HE'S NOT HAVING FUN ANYMORE. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOUR DOORS, DEBO? THEY'RE SO [BLEEP] LOOSE. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ALWAYS FALLING IN THE [BLEEP] DOGS. GET IT RIGHT, DUDE. WE'RE STARTING TO JUMP ON HIM A LITTLE MORE NOW, JUST BECAUSE OF THAT. I'M DONE WITH IT. YOU GUYS, I GOT TO GO. I THINK I AM A HARDWORKING GUY, MAN. I DO EVERYTHING THEY [BLEEP] TELL ME TO DO. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE RUN MY COUSIN'S BUSINESS BACK HOME, DOWN SOUTH IN SEATTLE. THAT IS NOTHING LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S JUST... THIS AIN'T ME, MAN. I WANTED TO GIVE IT A SHOT. HERE I AM. I'M DOING IT. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE HOPE ALIVE WITH DEBO, YOU KNOW? OH, THEY'RE RIGHT HERE. I TOOK THEM OFF, MAN. THIS THING'S [BLEEP] UP. IT'S COMING OFF. [ COUGHS ] Narrator: AS DEBO CONTINUES TO LOSE ANY RESPECT HE HAD... ...ON THE TIME BANDIT, DESPITE HIS SEASICKNESS, EARON IS SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT. ONCE HE GETS THE HANG OF IT, YOU KNOW, HE'LL DO GOOD. HE'S DOING PRETTY GOOD. AT LEAST HE'S GOT A SMILE ON HIS FACE, AND THAT'S THE WHOLE THING RIGHT THERE. GOT TO HAVE A SMILE. WE JUST WANT A KID THAT'S GONNA BE LOOKING OUT FOR STUFF AND CLEANING UP STUFF AND DOING ENGINEERING. IF HE'S GOOD AT THAT KIND OF STUFF AND WANTS TO DO IT, WE'LL HIRE HIM. [ GROANS ] Narrator: COMING UP... COME ON IN. THAT'S THE LAST TIME YOU'RE GONNA WALK IN MY WHEELHOUSE. THE CRAB COUNT -- THE WIZARD, STILL IN THE LEAD, IS DOMINATING THE FLEET. Narrator: BACK IN DUTCH, 270 MILES FROM THE FISHING GROUNDS, WIZARD CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN WAITS TO OFF-LOAD. Keith: WE NEED TO GET THIS CRAB OFF, AND...I NEED TO GET RID OF MOI. I'M OFFICIALLY DONE WITH MOI, AND MOI'S OFFICIALLY DONE WITH WORKING ON THE WIZARD. I'VE GOT A GUY THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DUE IN TOWN HERE ANY MINUTE. WE'RE A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH AND ABOUT TWO MORE TRIPS. HOPEFULLY, THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME DURATION. [ CLICKING ] I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK IN DUTCH, BUT I WANT TO GET BACK OUT ON THE WATER. HEY. MOI. MOI. Moilanen: YES, SIR. HEY, COME HERE. YOU WANT ME IN? COME ON IN. THAT'S THE LAST TIME YOU'RE GONNA WALK IN MY WHEELHOUSE. YOU'RE OFFICIALLY GONE. ALL RIGHT? OKAY. YEAH. THE LAST POT YOU HAULED WAS THIS TRIP ON THIS BOAT. OKAY. MOI, YOU VIOLATED A CARDINAL RULE THAT HAS GONE ON IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRY FOR CENTURIES. YOU DO NOT EVER GET IN THE CAPTAIN'S FACE. I'M NOT RIDING ANYBODY'S FREAKING COATTAILS. I BAITED -- [BLEEP] I BAITED THE FIRST 230 POTS. MOI, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT NOW -- GET OUT OF MY [BLEEP] WHEELHOUSE NOW! I THINK ONE THING YOU'VE LEARNED OUT HERE IS THAT IT'S A PRETTY GNARLY FISHERY. YEAH. AND YOU NEED COOPERATION FROM EVERYBODY. AND THE GUYS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN HAVE GOT TO SUCK IT UP AND LISTEN, ALL RIGHT? I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, AND I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN AT THAT POINT IN TIME. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, SKIP. OKAY. Keith: WELL, THAT'S NEVER EASY. I HOPE I'M NOT OVERREACTING, BECAUSE I JUST STRIPPED AWAY SOME GUY'S DREAMS OUT HERE. I'D LIKE TO TRY AND GET ON ANOTHER BOAT. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO EVEN START TO GO ABOUT IT. Narrator: A FEW HOURS LATER, 21-YEAR-OLD GREENHORN COOPER WEATHERBY ARRIVES AT THE WIZARD. Weatherby: HELLO. NEW GUY? NEW GUY. BEWARE OF STRANGERS BEARING GIFTS. LOOK AT THIS CRAP. GUY BROUGHT CUP OF NOODLES WITH HIM. THIS IS FOR YOU GUYS, HUH? YEAH. HERE YOU ARE. IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, I THANK YOU GUYS A LOT FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS, AND I'LL WORK MY ASS OFF TO TRY AND FILL THE GAPS, AND, YOU KNOW, CARRY MY WEIGHT AROUND HERE, SO... RIGHT ON. WELL, WE PRETTY MUCH HEAR THAT FROM EVERYBODY THAT WALKS ON. ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING IT'S ANOTHER STORY. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF REALLY BEAT-UP AND TIRED GUYS RIGHT NOW. IF YOU COULD HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT, IT WOULD DEFINITELY -- IT WOULD SEND A REAL STRONG MESSAGE TO YOUR TEAM. NOT A PROBLEM. YEAH. AND THAT WOULD BE GOOD. RIGHT ON. OKAY. WELL, WELCOME ABOARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. NEW GUY. NEW GUY'S... I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL TALK ABOUT HIM AFTER HE LEAVES. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH"... WHILE THE FATE OF THE NEW GREENHORNS HANG IN THE BALANCE... ...BACK IN ANCHORAGE, PHIL FIGHTS A BLOOD CLOT IN HIS LUNGS. I'M GONNA GO OUT, PUT MY BOOTS ON, GO OUTSIDE AND GET A LITTLE BIT OF FRESH AIR AND A NICE COCKTAIL. IF THESE LOVELY LADIES CATCH ME DOING THIS, THEY'D HAVE MY [BLEEP] ON A PLATTER. Narrator: BUT FOR THIS OLD SALT, OLD HABITS DIE HARD. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
