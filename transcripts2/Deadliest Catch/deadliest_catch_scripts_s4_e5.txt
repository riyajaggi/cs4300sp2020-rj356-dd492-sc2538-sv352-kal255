 IF YOU HEAR A YELP OUT OF THE BOYS, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. OH! YEAH! Narrator: WITH 90 CRAB PER POT AND RISING, EACH TABLE IS WORTH NEARLY 3,000 BUCKS. THIS IS A MOUNTAIN. BERING SEA KING CRAB -- NUMBER ONE. NUMBER ONE. LOOK AT HIM. "HI, GUYS." Narrator: WITH NUMBERS THIS GOOD, KEITH CALCULATES HE'LL ONLY NEED TO HAUL 30 POTS BEFORE TANKS ARE FULL. KEITH DECIDES TO POWER THROUGH HIS SCHEDULED NAP TIME. THAT MEANS YOUNGER BROTHER, MONTE, WILL HAVE TO SKIP HIS TURN AT THE WHEEL... AND JOIN THE MEN ON DECK. Man: OH! HE HATES GOING ON DECK WHEN HE WAKES UP, BUT RIGHT NOW I NEED FIVE GUYS OUT THERE. MOUSE, I HATE TO DO IT TO YOU, BUT I GOT TO HAVE YOU GO OUT THERE. FINISH THIS STRING FOR ME ON DECK. WELL, I GOT A POT OF COFFEE GOING. WELL, GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE. I COULD RUN THEM OUT TO 27, 28, 29 HOURS, BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT. IT'S NO BIG DEAL. I'LL GO OUTSIDE. [BLEEP] I DO IT ALL DAY LONG. WELL, MOUSE, I KNOW YOU GET CRANKY WHEN YOU GOT TO GET UP AND GO OUT THERE, BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE TRYING TO GO TO TOWN. WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME [BLEEP] DONE HERE. THAT'S WHAT I NEED, ALL RIGHT? I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] I'LL GO OUTSIDE. I DON'T [BLEEP] CARE. LET'S JUST TAKE THIS BOAT TO TOWN, AND I MIGHT JUST GET OFF THE [BLEEP] LENNY! GO PULL THESE POTS? Monte: LET'S GET THE HAUL. OKAY, BACK THIS WAY! COME ON! YEAH, I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING OUT HERE, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I DO RUN THE BOAT OUTRIGHT THROUGH, HELL, HALF OF THE YEAR. MY BROTHER ONLY SPENDS ABOUT HALF OF THE YEAR UP HERE. LAST TIME, I CAUGHT MORE CRAB THAN HE DID, ACTUALLY. [ SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] Keith: SO, MONTE WENT OUT THERE AND JUST TOOK A BLACK CLOUD WITH HIM, AND THEY'RE ON A 90 [BLEEP] AVERAGE, THAT LITTLE [BLEEP] [BLEEP] TIE! OOH! MY BROTHER'S GOT THAT ENTIRE CREW WOUND UP. HE COMES OUT WITH THE ATTITUDE LIKE THAT? THAT'S PRETTY MUCH [BLEEP] JUST REMEMBER,  IF HE STARTS TROUBLE, LENNY, JUST LET IT GO. GOD, I WISH HE WOULD JUST SHUT UP! SAME [BLEEP] DIFFERENT DAY. Narrator: AN HOUR LATER... THE CREW FINISHES THE STRING. AND MONTE IS FINALLY ABLE TO GRAB HIS MORNING COFFEE. THE MINUTE YOU WALK ON DECK, LENNY'S ATTITUDE WENT FROM GREAT TO [BLEEP] INSTANTLY! SOPER WAS BUBBLY AND HAPPY 'CAUSE HE'S COMING UP ON HIS POT, AND HE WENT [BLEEP] DOWNHILL. YOU TOOK YOUR -- NO, YOU TOOK YOUR [BLEEP] "I'M PISSED OFF THAT I GOT TO GO ON DECK IN THE MORNING" ATTITUDE OUT THERE WITH YOU, AND YOU DRUG THESE GUYS DOWN. YOU'RE ON [BLEEP] DECK. MAYBE I'M SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, BUT I DON'T THINK SO, ALL RIGHT? ASK THESE GUYS HOW -- NO! I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] ASK ANYBODY ANYTHING! WHAT I WANT OUT OF YOU IS A LITTLE COOPERATION! I WANT YOU TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THESE GUYS TO DO RIGHT NOW. I WANT YOU TO BELLY UP DOWN THE HOMESTRETCH AND [BLEEP] BE A TEAM PLAYER... NOT A "OH, I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT ON DECK FIRST THING IN THE MORNING" GUY. DID I SAY THAT TO ANYBODY? DID I SAY THAT TO ANYBODY?! I DID NOT! [ SCOFFS ] [BLEEP] IF I'VE EVER [BLEEP] SEEN AN [BLEEP] MY BROTHER'S AN [BLEEP] Narrator: 300 MILES SOUTH IN DUTCH HARBOR, THE CREW OF THE TIME BANDIT HAS JUST FINISHED THEIR FIRST OFF-LOAD OF THE SEASON. Johnathan: STRINGERS! EVERYONE HERE AND ACCOUNTED FOR? NOW WE ARE HEADED BACK OUT FOR OUR SECOND TRIP OF THE YEAR. WHOO! GOING CRAB FISHING, BABY. [ FOGHORN BLOWS ] Narrator: TROUBLE IS... THIS TIME, THEY'RE GOING OUT ONE MAN SHORT... Johnathan: WE HAD SCOTTY FLY HOME AFTER DOING A SHORT TRIP WITH US. HE JUST CAME OUT TO PROVE HIMSELF. ...AND ONE MAN INJURED. I GUESS JOHN'S GONNA KEEP ME OFF THE DECK FOR A LITTLE LONGER, SO I'M JUST MAKING CAKE AND BREAKFAST. I DON'T THINK THEY APPRECIATE IT. [ LAUGHS ] 'CAUSE HE'S THE...GALLEY GUY! [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: JUST AS THEY'RE GETTING UNDER WAY, A RAVEN PAYS THE BOAT A VISIT. [ SQUAWKS ] Man: LOOK AT THIS RAVEN. [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S GOT A LITTLE EGG. Man #2: THOSE ARE EGGS THAT WE THROW AT OTHER BOATS. HE JUST OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW CARTON. Man #3: WATCH THIS. Man #4: HE WILL GET AWAY. LOOK. Johnathan: NOW, THAT'S A LONG-ASS FLIGHT. HE'S GOT TO FLY A LONG WAYS NOW. A RAVEN EATING OUR EGGS. THAT BIRD IS STILL ON BOARD, DUDE. REALLY? THIS RAVEN AIN'T GONNA QUIT. Man: HE'S GREEDY. HE IS GREEDY. HE WANTS ANOTHER EGG. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? A RAVEN STEALING EGGS FROM ME -- IS THAT GOOD LUCK OR BAD LUCK? Narrator: THE TIME BANDIT MAKES A 28-HOUR RUN OVER DARK WATERS TO ITS FIRST STRING. WE'RE ABOUT READY TO PULL OUR POTS. WHAT DO YOU THINK, RUSS? WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M HOPING A 50 AVERAGE THROUGH THE GEAR 'CAUSE I KNOW SOME'S GONNA BE BETTER THAN OTHERS. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING? 87. THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING. 87. BUT WITH ONLY A QUARTER MILE TO THEIR FIRST POT... Man: WHOA! [ CLANGING ] [ RINGS ] Man: ANDY! Man #2: WE GOT TO GO! THE LIGHTS ARE ALL OUT. Man #3: WATCH OUT HOW YOU GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE PEEK. YOU WANT TO LOAD THE BOAT, AND I'LL GO LOOK? YEAH. [ RINGING CONTINUES ] WE DON'T HAVE ANY ELECTRICITY ON THE BOW. I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON. [ MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Man: WHAT I NEED IS ANOTHER FLASHLIGHT. Man #2: 550 [BLEEP] FLASHLIGHTS ARE NEAR THE BUILDING. WHERE DID THE [BLEEP] FLASHLIGHTS GO? WE GOT WIRES EXPOSED. THE [BLEEP] GOING ON? Narrator: THE CREW FINDS THE BOAT'S VITAL FUNCTIONS INTACT, BUT THE WIRING TO THE LIGHTS IS FRIED. A SHIP ENGULFED BY NIGHT IN THESE WATERS IS AN EASY TARGET FOR COLLISION WITH ANOTHER VESSEL. 277-VOLT. THAT WOULD LIGHT YOU UP PRETTY WELL. MAKING MATTERS WORSE, THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW HOW OR WHY THE SYSTEM HAS SHORTED OUT, PUTTING THE SHIP AT ULTIMATE RISK OF FIRE. THIS IS FIRE-HAZARD ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. Man: FIBERGLASS FIRE HERE? FIBERGLASS? YEAH. IF WE CAN'T PUT THAT FIRE OUT, YOU GOT TO GET OFF THE BOAT. A FIRE CAN TRAP YOU, PUT YOU SO YOU CAN'T GET YOUR SURVIVAL SUITS. Narrator: 250 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT IS FLOATING BLIND IN THE BERING SEA DARKNESS. WE HAVE NO LIGHTS, OCEAN LIGHTS, TO SEE THE OCEAN AT NIGHTTIME. WE'VE GOT NO LIGHTS UP HERE. SEE THE BLACK WIRES? YOU GOT A BLACK, A BLACK, AND GREEN. Narrator: IN THE FOREPEAK, THE CREW IS DOING SOME FRANTIC REWIRING. COME HERE. TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN. DURING OUR POUNDING TODAY, THIS 40-POUND BALLAST FOR THE BIG SODIUM LIGHTS RIPPED OFF OF THE WALL. IT RIPPED ALL THE WIRING OUT, BLEW THE ENTIRE FORWARD-BREAKER SYSTEM. Johnathan: THEY CAN'T PULL CRAB HERE AT NIGHT. WITHOUT LIGHTS UP THERE, IT'S GONNA BE A BITCH. PUT ONE RIGHT HERE. IT'LL NEVER COME OUT, MAN. Narrator: THE MEN SCRAMBLE IN DARKNESS WHILE THE RISING SEA POUNDS THE HULL. [ THUD ] IT'S LIKE THERE'S A GREAT, BIG RHINOCEROS RIGHT OVER THERE. AS THEY WORK TO REPAIR THE BALLAST, ELECTROCUTION AND FIRE ARE CONSTANT RISKS. THE SEAS ARE BUILDING HERE. [ WAVES CRASHING ] [ THUD ] WHOA! YEAH, BABY. THAT WAS A GOOD ONE. UGH. WE GOT OUR BLACKS FROM BOTH SIDES. MAN: We are ready for you to turn the toggles on the 30 lights. Man: WHOO-HOO! YEAH, BABY! WE GOT LIGHTS! Man: HEY. GOOD JOB, GUYS. GOOD JOB. Johnathan: WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF A RAVEN STEALS FROM YOU? DOES THAT -- I DON'T KNOW. HOPEFULLY, IT JUST MEANS A LITTLE BAD LUCK. [BLEEP] BIRDS. Narrator: WITH THE BALLAST FIXED AND HOPES OF BAD LUCK BEHIND THEM, THE CREW ZEROS IN ON THEIR FIRST STRING. HANG ON. HANG ON. I WANT SOME CRAB ON THIS [BLEEP] BOAT! Man: YEE-HAW! [ JOHNATHAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ON LOUDSPEAKER ] 49! YEAH, BABY! 49. WOW. 7...4! 7-4, BABY. YEAH! YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE. OH, YEAH! [ Laughing ] YEAH! Man: WHOO! THESE GUYS MUST HAVE MADE 150 BUCKS ON THAT POT. Johnathan:  150 BUCKS EACH FOR THE DECK. EVEN THE GALLEY MADE 150 OFF THAT ONE. YOU HAVE TO BRING ONE CUP OF COFFEE TO MAKE THAT MONEY? YOU NEED MORE COFFEE? I THINK I GOT A WHOLE POT DOWN THERE FOR YOU. Narrator: 100 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST ON THE WIZARD... ...CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN AND HIS BROTHER, MONTE, ARE NAVIGATING A SERIOUS BREACH OF BROTHERLY LOVE. NO! I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] ASK ANYBODY ANYTHING! WHAT I WANT OUT OF YOU IS A LITTLE COOPERATION! HE'S THE ONE WITH THE ATTITUDE. MAYBE I'M SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, BUT I DON'T THINK SO, ALL RIGHT? HE'S TRYING TO CAUSE SOME KIND OF [BLEEP] CONTROVERSY. I WENT OUTSIDE. I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. HE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOT A [BLEEP] PROBLEM. Keith: YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT FIGHT WASN'T SO MUCH ABOUT FISHING BUT MORE ABOUT JUST BEING BROTHERS. MONTE AND I GO THROUGH IT EVERY NOW AND THEN, YOU KNOW? HE'S GOT HIS IDEAS. I'VE GOT MY IDEAS. HE'S A CAPTAIN. I'M A CAPTAIN. AND YOU PUT TWO CAPTAINS ON A BOAT, PERIODICALLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. HE'S KNOWS THAT WHEN I'M ON THE BOAT, I'M THE CAPTAIN. AT TIMES, IT'S TOUGH FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT SECOND POSITION. Narrator: DAWN BREAKS, AND THE BOAT MOVES IN ON THE LAST FEW POTS BEFORE HEADING IN TO OFF-LOAD. ANOTHER SHIFT ON DECK ALLOWS MONTE THE EXTRA TIME NEEDED TO COOL OFF. Keith: ONE MORE POT, GUYS. THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IS COMING UP. BOOYA! Man: HERE IT COMES, BABY! 182. WHOO! WHOO! WHOO! THAT'S THE POT TO END ON. RIGHT ON. Narrator: WITH THE LAST POT ABOARD... WHOO! ...AND NEARLY 183,000 POUNDS OF CRAB IN THE TANKS, THE CREW ENDS THEIR FIRST RUN OF THE SEASON. ALASKAN KING CRAB! Narrator: FOR KEITH AND MONTE, THE TRIP HAS LEFT THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN KNOTS. WE'RE ALL KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING A COUPLE OF DAYS. BUT, YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING TO TOWN. Narrator: NEXT, A GREENHORN TRIES TO WORK HIS WAY UP BUT MAKES WAVES WITH THE OTHER DECKHANDS. YOU CAN BREAK THESE GUYS SO [BLEEP] EASY. IT'S SO EASY TO PISS THEM OFF. Narrator: IT'S FRIDAY IN DUTCH HARBOR. AND THE CORNELIA MARIE IS FUELED UP AND READY TO EMBARK ON ITS SECOND RUN OF THE SEASON. BUT INSIDE, CAPTAIN PHIL IS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING GOING. Phil: WELL, I GOT UP THIS MORNING AND HAD A CUP OF COFFEE AND A DOUGHNUT, BUT I THREW THAT UP. I HAD TO GO BACK ON THE TOILET FOR A LITTLE WHILE, AND THEN, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, I THREW UP AGAIN. SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON. Narrator: ON THE FIRST TRIP, POOR NUMBERS NEARLY PUSHED THE CAPTAIN OVER THE EDGE. I SEE ABOUT TWO CRAB, ONE CRAB. MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS PROBABLY UP A LITTLE BIT AT THE END OF THAT LAST TRIP. I TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY. Narrator: PHIL'S HEALTH IS ALSO A CONCERN FOR JOSH, HIS OLDEST SON. HOPEFULLY HE GETS BETTER 'CAUSE THERE'S A LOT DEPENDING ON HIM, AND YOU DON'T GET A CALL-IN-SICK DAY WHEN YOU'RE A CRAB FISHERMAN. IT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE. HE HAS A LOT MORE PRESSURE ON HIS SHOULDERS 'CAUSE WE DEPEND ON HIM TO FIND OUR CRAB. Narrator: TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, IT'S FRIDAY. THE SUPERSTITIOUS CAPTAIN IS HAVING RESERVATIONS ABOUT LEAVING PORT. HEY, EVERYBODY, GO TO THE GALLEY, WOULD YOU? I WANT TO TALK TO EVERYBODY. CAN YOU GO TO THE GALLEY FOR A MINUTE? GET IN HERE AND SIT DOWN. HEY, GUYS, I'M THINKING ABOUT STAYING HERE. IT'S FRIDAY. THE LAST TWO TIMES I'VE LEFT ON FRIDAY, I'VE BLOWN A MAIN ENGINE UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK? DOES ANYBODY GOT ANYTHING TO SAY? IT'S BAD JUJU. IT'S BAD JUJU. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING GOOD HAPPEN LEAVING ON FRIDAY. YOU KNOW, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THAT AIN'T GONNA BE GOOD. CAPTAIN AND CREW'S DECISION TO PLAY IT SAFE WILL PUT THEM YET ANOTHER DAY BEHIND IN THEIR QUEST FOR KING CRAB. NOBODY IS TRYING HARDER THIS SEASON THAN I AM... NOBODY. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST SOME THINGS YOU DO AND SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T. I NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET. Narrator: 230 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST... ...THE NORTHWESTERN IS ONLY 30,000 POUNDS AWAY FROM STUFFING HER TANK. BUT WITH AVERAGE NUMBERS IN THE POTS, IT'LL BE A LONG GRIND BEFORE THEY HEAD IN TO OFF-LOAD. 21 CRAB. [ SIGHS ] WE JUST WANT TO GO HOME WITH THIS [BLEEP] FULL. THAT'S OUR GLORY... AND THAT'S OUR GOAL. Narrator: DOWN ON DECK, GREENHORN JAKE IS PRACTICING SOME OLD-SCHOOL SKILLS. Edgar: YEAH. BIGGER. BIGGER. NOT BAD, JUNIOR. I GOT TO DO IT AGAIN. I GOT TO DO IT AGAIN. I GOT TO DO IT FULL SPEED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME!? JUST A YEAR AGO, HE COULD BARELY KEEP UP WITH THE SEASONED HANDS. THOSE OLD-SCHOOL GUYS -- THEY'RE TOUGH. Narrator: NOW HE'S DETERMINED TO ADVANCE TO A FULL SHARE. ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE KID IS THAT HE ASPIRES TO BE BETTER, AND YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM HIM. I DON'T WANT TO. Man: COME ON! AND I THINK, RIGHT NOW, THE WAY THINGS ARE, HE POSES A THREAT TO MATT, AND THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. WE WANT TO SEE A LITTLE COMPETITION ON DECK. REACH WAY OUT WITH THIS HAND, AS FAR AS IT GOES, AND YOU GO... YOU GOT TO PINCH IT A LITTLE BIT. Bradley: THANK GOD FOR COILERS. THANK GOD FOR HYDRAULICS. THIS AIN'T 1960. HEY, CAN I DO ONE MORE? NO, LET'S LEAVE IT ALONE. COME ON. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BE A CRAB FISHERMAN? JUST LEAVE IT ALONE. I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO GET A GOOD ONE. [ Laughing ] I DON'T CARE. THIS IS NOT A JOKE TO ME, ALL RIGHT? THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS WHY THE OTHER GUYS DON'T WANT TO LEARN, 'CAUSE THEY COULD DIE. Edgar: HURT HIS FEELINGS. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE SOME HALF-ASS DECKHAND. BRADLEY -- HE DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. IT'S A JOKE TO HIM... BECAUSE HE'S A JOKE. COME HERE, LITTLE EDGAR FISH. THIS IS ACTUALLY AN EDGAR HANSEN FISH. MAKES ME ANGRY SOMETIMES. I'M JUST SICK OF BEING [BLEEP] NOBODY. I GOT TO LEAVE JUNIOR A LITTLE REMINDER. EVERY TIME HE WALKS OUT ON DECK, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO SEE THIS. "CHECK YOUR FEELINGS AT THE DOOR." READ THE SIGN OUT LOUD. Anderson: "CHECK YOUR FEELINGS AT THE DOOR." [BLEEP] THAT STUPID SIGN. LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE FEELINGS. YOU CAN BREAK THESE GUYS SO EASY. THEY DON'T THINK THAT I KNOW THEM. I JUST PRETEND THAT I DON'T KNOW THEM. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST -- IT'S SO EASY TO PISS THEM OFF. THEY NEED TO [BLEEP] CHECK THE [BLEEP] SIGN BEFORE THEY GO OUT. Narrator: COMING UP... THE RIVALRY EXPLODES ON THE DECK OF THE NORTHWESTERN. DO YOUR JOB! DO YOUR [BLEEP] JOB! [BLEEP] Narrator: 220 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR. THE 108-FOOT EARLY DAWN HAS BEEN PULLING BAD NUMBERS FOR DAYS. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE JUST NOT FINDING WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS YEAR. 18! 1-8. Narrator: BUT CAPTAIN RICK FEHST IS CONFIDENT HE'S FINALLY ZEROING IN ON A DECENT CATCH. I'LL GET DIALED IN. IT WON'T TAKE ME LONG. YEAH, THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. WE'RE CATCHING SOME. BETTER THAN ONE AT A TIME, I GUESS. Narrator: TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME, RICK'S ENFORCING A "20-HOUR-ON, 4-HOUR-OFF" ROTATION FOR THE ENTIRE CREW. I WORKED ON THREE BOATS WHERE WE DID A ROTATION. ON THREE OF THEM I END UP GETTING HURT ON BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING AROUND THE CLOCK. Fehst: DO YOU THINK IT'S BETTER TO GO WITH NO SLEEP, NO REST WHATSOEVER? I'M JUST SAYING WHAT HAPPENED. SOMEBODY ENDED UP GETTING INJURED. I'M STICKING TO MY PLAN, 'CAUSE I'VE DONE IT BEFORE, AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. AFTER BREAKFAST... ...THE FIRST ROTATION STARTS DROPPING POTS IN WHAT RICK HOPES WILL BE A HONEY HOLE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS FIND THE MOB -- THE MASS BIOMASS OF CRAB. I THINK WE'RE GETTING WARM HERE. Narrator: THE GREENHORN, BRYAN, IS ALREADY LATE FOR HIS NEW SHIFT. GETTING MY RAIN GEAR ON. I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO BED, BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. Man: LET'S GO! COME ON, BRYAN! HELP ME OUT! Fehst: HIS DAD ACTUALLY OWNS THE COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR, AND DAD TOLD HIM, "YOU'RE GOING FISHING, "OR YOU'RE GOING IN THE MILITARY. WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE?" WELL, SO, I GOT CHOSEN TO BE THE ONE TO BREAK HIM IN ON THE EARLY DAWN HERE. Narrator: AS THE BOSS' SON, BRYAN'S POSITION ON THE SHIP COMES WITH AN EXTRA DOSE OF SCRUTINY FROM THE CREW. HOLD IT, HOLD IT. HAUL THE [BLEEP] UP. IT'S BACKWARDS [BLEEP] YOU KNOW WHAT? I [BLEEP] COILED IT. I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT IS. THE OTHER GUYS RIDE HIM CONSTANTLY. THEY LET HIM KNOW WHEN HE'S SLIPPING. HE DEFINITELY GETS EARFULS, NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. I HEAR IT FROM UP HERE. WE LIKE TO GET HIM ALL RILED UP 'CAUSE THEN HE WORKS. GO AHEAD. TAKE THAT CROWBAR TO MY LEGS. SEND ME HOME. Man: READY TO GO. HOPE THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT. MY DAD WILL BE PISSED. Narrator: COME NIGHTFALL, RICK'S HUNCH IS STARTING TO PAY OFF. 36! 3-6. WE'RE STARTING TO PICK UP. WE'RE STARTING TO HONE IN ON THEM A LITTLE BIT. HOLD ON. HO! HO! I'D RATHER SEE SOME. Narrator: BUT THE LONG HOURS ARE TAKING A TOLL ON EVERYONE... ESPECIALLY BRYAN. [ GROANS ] Mezich: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, BUT I MUST HAVE TWEAKED SOMETHING OR TWINGED SOMETHING. I MEAN, MY LOWER, LOWER BACK RIGHT ABOVE MY WAIST -- JUST SHOOTING PAINS. Narrator: THE MORE SEASONED CREW MEMBERS AREN'T SHOWING HIM ANY MERCY. OW! THAT COLLAR IS SEASONED, HUH, BRY? OW! SEASONED! IT SLOWS ME DOWN, YOU KNOW? THAT SLOWS DOWN THE OPERATION. Man: OH, WHAT'D HE DO -- RUN INSIDE? OH, YOU KNOW THESE KIDS THESE DAYS. [ LAUGHS ] ANY REASON TO GET OFF DECK. I WANT TO GO HOME. I'VE BEEN UP HERE TOO LONG. Narrator: 120 MILES TO THE EAST. THE NORTHWESTERN IS ONLY ONE STRING AWAY FROM ITS FIRST OFF-LOAD OF THE SEASON. BUT ALL THEIR HARD WORK IS RESULTING IN LITTLE MORE THAN EMPTY POTS... AND STARFISH... ...A SURE SIGN THAT THE CRAB HAVE MOVED. WE'VE BEEN GRINDING ON IT... AND GRINDING ON IT. WE'RE NOT GONNA STOP TILL SHE'S FULL. I DON'T KNOW. I JUST HAVE IT IN MY MIND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO, AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. Narrator: EVEN WITH THE LONG HOURS, THE GREENHORN IS STILL TRYING TO MOVE UP IN RANK. Edgar: YEAH, LET'S STACK IT. GO DOWN A LITTLE. DOWN A LITTLE. DOWN. DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. THE EXTRA TIME EDGAR SPENDS WITH THE GREENHORN, JAKE, MEANS MORE TIME ON DECK FOR EVERYONE ELSE. AND FOR DECKHAND MATT BRADLEY, JAKE'S ENTHUSIASM IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SUCKING UP. DAMN, THAT SUCKS! [ LAUGHS ] CAN I DO ONE MORE? OKAY, ALL OF THAT'S GOT TO STOP. HOLD ON. CHECK YOUR FEELINGS AT THE DOOR. I'M TIRED. I KNOW THEY'RE TIRED. TAKE IT EASY. YOU GOT THE MOST ANGRY GUY HELPING YOU SORT CRAB. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I CAN SMELL IT, AND EVERYBODY CAN SENSE THAT MATT HAS THIS TENSION. WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY? HE'S A LITTLE THREATENED. HIS POSITION IS THREATENED. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. [BLEEP] SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP. [BLEEP] RIGHT NOW, HUH? YEAH! Man: HEY! HEY! KNOCK IT OFF! HEY! [BLEEP] TRY IT AGAIN, YOU LITTLE [BLEEP] COME ON! I'LL THROW YOU IN THE [BLEEP] PEN AGAIN! DO YOUR [BLEEP] JOB! DO YOUR [BLEEP] JOB, AND SHUT YOUR [BLEEP] MOUTH! SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP! Man: HEY! HEY! KNOCK IT OFF! HEY! [BLEEP] TRY IT AGAIN, YOU LITTLE [BLEEP] COME ON! I'LL THROW YOU IN THE [BLEEP] PEN AGAIN. DO YOUR [BLEEP] JOB! WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH EVERYBODY? WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN THERE? GO TO YOUR ROOM. WE GOT FOUR POTS LEFT TO GO, AND THEY CAN'T TAKE IT? Narrator: 230 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE HIERARCHY ON DECK OF THE  NORTHWESTERN IS IN SHAMBLES. RIGHT NOW, HUH? YEAH. Man: HEY! HEY! KNOCK IT OFF! Sig: I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW. ACTING LIKE A BUNCH OF APES. Man: THEY'RE ANTAGONIZING EACH OTHER, AND I GUESS MATT LOST IT THERE FOR A SECOND. COME ON! I'LL THROW YOU IN THE [BLEEP] PEN AGAIN! Narrator: RESTORING ORDER IS DECK BOSS EDGAR'S FIRST PRIORITY. HE'S A PIECE OF [BLEEP] WHAT'S GOING ON, ANYWAY? I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST GOT A LITTLE EXCITED. HE WENT FOR YOUR THROAT. YEAH, HE GRABBED ME. THAT'S WHY I SWUNG. Man: HEY! HEY! KNOCK IT OFF! HEY! TRY IT AGAIN, YOU LITTLE [BLEEP] COME ON! Narrator: A FIGHT ON DRY LAND IS ONE THING, BUT AT SEA, IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO GET YOURSELF KILLED. YOU JUST DON'T START GOING AT EACH OTHER LIKE THAT. YOU CAN BARK AND SCREAM ALL YOU WANT, BUT YOU DON'T GO AT EACH OTHER. THEY SHOULD KNOW BETTER. MATT SHOULD KNOW BETTER. YOU KNOW, YOU SETTLE YOUR DIFFERENCES, OR YOU TAKE THEM TO TOWN, BUT YOU DON'T DO IT ON A BOAT. Edgar: I MEAN, MATT WAS THE NEW GUY ON HERE NOT TOO LONG AGO. HE'S SCARED OF THE KID SHOWING HIM UP. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. I DON'T HAVE ANY LEG TO STAND ON ON THIS BOAT. THE LINE IS SO LONG TO GET ON THIS BOAT. I DIDN'T WANT ANY TROUBLE. I'LL WORK WITH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT ALL DAY LONG HERE. I LOVE IT HERE. I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE. YOU'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO COME ALONG TO THIS BOAT IN A LONG TIME... WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT. AND I MEAN THAT. HE DOESN'T -- HE'S SCARED OF YOU. HE'S THREATENED BY YOU. Narrator: WITH THEIR CAREERS ON THE LINE, CAPTAIN SIG CALLS THEM INTO THE GALLEY. THE NEXT TIME ANYBODY SWINGS, THEY'RE GONE ON THE SPOT -- DONE. THAT'S -- FAMILY OR NO FAMILY. IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS FAMILY, ACT LIKE IT... BOTH OF YOU. 120 MILES TO THE WEST. THE EARLY DAWN IS HEADING INTO SEVERE WEATHER. YEAH, WE'RE EXPECTING SOME HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS HERE. YEAH. YOU GOT TO LOVE IT, HUH? Mezich: IT'S PROBABLY BLOWING ABOUT 45 RIGHT NOW WITH 15-, 20-FOOT SEAS. ONCE IT HITS ABOUT 60 MILES AN HOUR AND 30-FOOT SEAS, WE HAVE TO CALL IT QUITS -- QUIT FISHING. TOO DANGEROUS TO BE ON DECK. THEY'RE HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE. TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM POTS SLIDING AROUND ON THE DECK. Narrator: AFTER A DAY OF A GRUELING NEW SCHEDULE... ...AND FIGHTING 20-FOOT WAVES, THE CREW FINALLY DROPS THEIR LAST POT OF THE STRING. NOW IT'S TIME FOR SOME MUCH DESERVED SLEEP. BUT THERE'S NO REST FOR THE GREENHORN, AS BRYAN TAKES HIS SHIFT ON WHEEL WATCH. WELL, WE'VE HAD A 2-1/2-HOUR RUN FROM WHERE WE WERE TO WHERE WE WANTED TO BE, SO SKIPPER GOES TO BED, AND I TAKE THE WHEEL. Narrator: TO ENSURE BRYAN STAYS AWAKE AFTER ENDURING 20 GRUELING HOURS ON DECK, THE SKIPPER HAS SET A WATCH ALARM TO RING EVERY 15 MINUTES -- A REQUIREMENT FOR ANY MAN ON WATCH. FOR BRYAN, THE TWO MONTHS OF PHYSICAL TORMENT IS TAKING ITS TOLL. I JUST WANT TO SIT AT HOME ON A COMFORTABLE COUCH. I'M MENTALLY EXHAUSTED, TOO, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET ANY TIME OFF, YOU'RE [BLEEP] FRIED. Narrator: COMING UP, FATIGUE GETS THE UPPER HAND, AND THE BERING SEA STRIKES. [ WAVES CRASH ] Man: WHOA! THE CRAB COUNT. THE WIZARD AND NORTHWESTERN ARE NECK AND NECK. Narrator: 180 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE EARLY DAWN IS IN 25-FOOT SEAS AND 60-KNOT WINDS. GREENHORN BRYAN MEZICH, SEVEN MINUTES INTO HIS WATCH, IS FADING QUICKLY. MINUTE 10 -- BRYAN NODS OFF JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE ALARM IS SET TO RING. BUT ON THE BERING SEA, THINGS CAN GO WRONG...FAST. [ WAVES CRASH ] Man: WHOA! [ MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] BRYAN? [ DOOR OPENS ] [BLEEP] CAME FLYING OUT OF OUR CLOSET, AND I ASKED, "WHO'S SLEEPING UP ON THE WHEEL?" BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE SOMEBODY WAS ACTUALLY SLEEPING AT THE WHEEL. Narrator: WHEN THE CAPTAIN FINDS OUT, HE DEMANDS AN EXPLANATION. Fehst: HEY, BRYAN. YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME AND REST OF THE CREW HERE? SLEEPING'S OKAY ON A WATCH? NO, I KNOW THAT'S NOT OKAY. I [BLEEP] HAVE NO EXPLAIN FOR THAT. YOU [BLEEP] PIECE OF [BLEEP] I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. I WAS SITTING THERE, AND THEN IT OPENED UP, AND IT... Fish: LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD YOUR HOOD ON, AND YOU WERE ALL COMFORTABLE WITH THE CHAIR KICKED BACK, AND JUST...GONE. YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED. YEAH. SORRY, GUYS. SORRY DON'T [BLEEP] DO HERE. [BLEEP] BOAT'S GETTING SLAMMED FROM SIDE TO SIDE. WHAT'S MY [BLEEP] POLICY? I THINK I EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU A LONG TIME AGO AND TO EVERYBODY ELSE. WHAT'S MY POLICY? TERMINATION. NO EXCUSES. Narrator: BUT BRYAN'S FATHER IS ALSO THE BOAT'S OWNER, SO RICK HAS TO RUN ANY MAJOR DECISIONS BY HIM. WE ACTUALLY TOOK A PRETTY DAMN GOOD JOLT. YEAH. I JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS. BUT THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THAT. I MEAN... I GUESS WE'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW. $500 FINE FOR RECLINING ON A WATCH. Narrator: AS AN OWNER OF AN ENTIRE FLEET OF SHIPS, BRYAN'S FATHER KNOWS HIS SON ISN'T THE FIRST TO SUCCUMB TO THE INEVITABLE EXHAUSTION OF LIFE ON A CRAB BOAT. I'M NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THAT PHONE CALL. YOU'RE NOT BEING TERMINATED... NOT THIS TIME. BEING THE OWNER'S SON HAS ITS PERKS. BUT LIVING DOWN HIS MISTAKE WITH THE REST OF THE CREW MAY START TO MAKE THE DECK OF THIS BOAT FEEL AWFULLY SMALL FOR SOME TIME TO COME. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ONE LEAVES A VERY SOUR TASTE IN MY MOUTH. Narrator: 60 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST... ...THE CORNELIA MARIE IS APPROACHING HER MOMENT OF TRUTH. AFTER WEEKS OF PULLING BLANKS AND SINGLE DIGITS, CAPTAIN PHIL IS DESPERATE FOR A DECENT CATCH AS HE ARRIVES AT THE GROUNDS. THE ANTICIPATION IS BIG FOR ME RIGHT NOW. IT'S HUGE, YOU KNOW? I GOT TO MAKE THIS WORK. FIRST POT OF THE STRING, SECOND TRIP. WE GOT HIGH HOPES FOR THIS YEAR. THAT IS ONE FULL CRAB POT. Man: YEE-HAW! THAT'S A LOT OF CRAB. Man #2: YEAH!
