 [ Sniffles ] Okay. I LOVE YOU. I love you. There's a gumby suit on our right. Man in the water. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: AFTER EIGHT DAYS, STEAMING FROM PORTS ACROSS THE LOWER 48... ...THE ELITE ALASKAN KING CRAB-FISHING FLEET RETURNS. $84 MILLION IS ON THE LINE. WELCOME BACK TO DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA. Man: COME ON, KID, WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY. HEY, MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALL TAGGED. YOU'RE GOOD. HEADS UP OVER THERE. Sig: REALITY CHECK -- WE JUST DUMPED 800,000 BUCKS INTO THIS THING. I KNOW. WE GOT TO PAY FOR IT NOW. JUST DON'T STRESS ME OUT, PERIOD. I WOULDN'T DO THAT. Narrator: AFTER 30 YEARS ON THE BERING SEA, THE AGING CRAB FLEET HAS BEGUN TO FALTER. TO BREATHE LIFE BACK INTO THE BOATS, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE SPENT AT THE SHIPYARDS. ON THE WIZARD... WE'VE GOT $5,000 IN THE AIR SYSTEM, AND WE GOT AN AIR LEAK AGAIN -- HAVE YOU HEARD IT? I KNOW YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO TRY AND KEEP THE COST DOWN, BUT WE GOT TO GET THE BOAT OUT OF TOWN. WE GOT TO DO IT NOW. TRY AND GET THESE GUYS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME URGENCY HERE. COME ON, GUYS, LET'S PICK UP THE PACE. Narrator: ...THE BANK ISN'T THE ONLY PRESSURE RIDING KEITH'S HEELS. A 22-YEAR TOBACCO HABIT HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH THE SKIPPER. THERE'S A BIOPSY THAT'S PENDING RIGHT NOW, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO GET IT TOMORROW. HE'S BEEN MONITORING SOME STUFF IN MY MOUTH OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS FROM MY CHEWING-TOBACCO HABIT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PRECANCEROUS, IF IT'S ACTUALLY CANCEROUS -- I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, IF THEY TELL ME I GOT TO GO IN AND HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL WHATEVER DONE TO MY MOUTH, I MEAN, I'M GONNA HAVE TO BAIL. Narrator: AS KEITH FACES HIS OWN MORTALITY, ON THE CORNELIA MARIE... ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, LET'S GET THESE POTS ON. WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS IS BACK WITH HIS BOYS, JOSH AND JAKE, AND NOW PREPARES FOR THE COMEBACK OF HIS CAREER. Jake: GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, POPS. THANK YOU, BUBBA. THANKS. I APPRECIATE IT. DECIDED THAT YOU COULDN'T START A SEASON WITHOUT THIS AWESOME, AWESOME LITTLE GEL THING OF SPARKLING MULLET RUB. [ LAUGHTER ] I HOPE THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ME. NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT. I WAS GONNA DRAW A HARLEY TATTOO ON THE SIDE, BUT -- THIS IS DUAL ACTION. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. [ LAUGHTER ] Phil: YEAH, I'M EXCITED. YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS SINCE I'VE BEEN ON A BOAT. SO I'M READY TO GO FISHING. Narrator: DURING LAST YEAR'S OPILIO SEASON, PHIL NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH AFTER A MASSIVE BLOOD CLOT PASSED THROUGH HIS HEART. I CAN'T BREATHE. I CAN'T BREATHE. IT WAS REALLY CLOSE. YOU KNOW, THEY KIND OF SAID IT WAS LIKE 100 TO 1 THAT I MADE IT THROUGH THAT. SO I WAS PRETTY LUCKY. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK. THE EAGLES ARE FLYING. IT'S WARM OUT. IT'S NICE. IT'S LIKE HOME. Narrator: AND AT HOME, SOME THINGS, WELL, NEVER CHANGE. WE MAY HAVE AN ISSUE. WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR ALL OF OUR BAIT SACKS, AND APPARENTLY THEY SEEM TO [BLEEP] GROWN LEGS. OH, COME ON. I WISH I COULD TELL YOU SOMETHING. AT THE END OF LAST SEASON, PHIL ENTRUSTED JAKE AND JOSH TO CAREFULLY STOW THE FISHING GEAR... INCLUDING THE BAIT SACKS. I'M NOT GONNA TURN AROUND AND SPEND ANOTHER $2,000, $3,000 ON BAIT SACKS BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE TOO [BLEEP] LAME TO PUT THEM SOMEWHERE. GO GRAB SOME HELP AND GO LOOK, FIND THEM. WE STACKED THESE SHOTS IN HERE, DUDE. WHY WOULD WE, LIKE, STACK ALL THIS STUFF ON TOP OF [BLEEP] BAIT SACKS? IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DO. SO BEING BACK THERE AND TRYING TO MOVE ALL THAT [BLEEP] RIGHT NOW IS [BLEEP] POINTLESS, BECAUSE -- WELL, THEY'RE NOT IN THERE, SO OBVIOUSLY THEY GOT TO BE IN HERE. WELL, YEAH, BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T EVEN PUT THEM IN THIS CONTAINER. YOU DRUG THEM IN THAT CONTAINER WITH ALL THE BAIT JARS. AND SO WHY THE [BLEEP] WOULD THEY BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE IN THIS CONTAINER? UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK, [BLEEP] FIND [BLEEP] SACKS. THIS IS WHAT DAD WANTS, AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT. OKAY, I KNOW, I KNOW. WELL, IF YOU KNOW, THEN DON'T ARGUE IT. 20 [BLEEP] SACKS. YOU'RE GONNA SEE [BLEEP] BAIT SACKS, YOU KNOW? EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT HERE. YEAH, YOU'RE GETTING [BLEEP] CUTE. Josh: HE'S GONNA BLAME THIS ON ME. OH, MAN. Narrator: THE MISSING BAIT SACKS JUST COST DEAR OLD DAD ANOTHER 5 GRAND. WITH 12 HOURS UNTIL THE SKIPPERS LEAVE FOR THE GROUNDS, CREWS WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT TO TRANSFORM 316 TONS OF HULKING, RUSTING STEEL INTO CRAB-FISHING MACHINES. 60 POTS TO GO. I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS YEAR. MEANWHILE, THE SKIPPERS HAVE OTHER PLANS. Johnathan: WE'RE GOING TO THE BURN BARREL. ALL THE CAPTAINS, EVERY YEAR, WE -- WE ALL -- WE ALL GATHER BY THE BURN BARREL. ARGH. IT'S A BIT OF TRADITION. OUR FATHERS' FATHERS' FATHERS GATHERED BY THE BURN BARREL. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY CALL UP AND THEY GO, "HEY, WE WANT TO COME UP AND STAY WITH YOU." "YEAH, WHAT'S THE CATCH? I'M NOT GIVING YOU MONEY. I HAVEN'T GOT ANY [BLEEP] SO, WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU WANT?" YOU KNOW? I JUST TOOK AWAY THEIR MAJOR FOOD GROUPS THERE. THE LIQUOR CABINET'S EMPTY. YEAH, AND I AIN'T GOT NO BOOZE, 'CAUSE YOU DRANK IT ALL LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE. ALL KIDDING AROUND, I THANK GOD EVERY DAY I GOT THOSE GUYS. SEE, MAN, YOU LOOK GOOD. YOU LOOK GOOD, BROTHER. IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK. YOU'RE LOOKING REAL GOOD. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT FOR SURE. HOW YOU DOING, KEITH? I'VE GOT SORES IN MY CHEEK, AND I KEEP BITING MY LIP AND STUFF. Sig: DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT A KNIFE IN YOUR RIBS? YOU CAN'T BREATHE. I JUST FEEL LIKE I GOT A KNIFE IN THERE. WELL, IS ANYBODY IN THIS GROUP HEALTHY? I AM. ANDY? WELL, RIGHT ON. GOOD DEAL. SERIOUSLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS WHOLE INDUSTRY AND WHAT IT'S BECOME AND ALL THAT, THERE'S LEGACIES THAT GO WAY BACK. OH, YEAH. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S ALL STARTING TO CHANGE, MAN. Johnathan: THERE ISN'T THAT MANY REALLY YOUNG CAPTAINS ANY MORE, YOU KNOW. THERE AIN'T NO MORE. WE GOT SCOTTY. HE'S A GOOD KID. BUT YOU STILL HAVE FIVE PEOPLE'S LIVES IN YOUR HANDS ON DECK THERE, AND IT AIN'T JUST DRIVING A BOAT. AND YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF IF YOU'D GO OUT ON DECK WHEN HE'S RUNNING THE BOAT -- WOULD YOU? WOULD YOU WORK FOR HIM? Sig: FAMILY CAN BE A PAIN IN THE ASS. I THINK YOU CAN ATTEST TO THAT. YOU CAN ATTEST TO THAT. YOU CAN DEFINITELY ATTEST TO THAT. MY OLD MAN WAS NOT EXACTLY PEACHES AND CREAM, BUT IT BUILDS CHARACTER. IF THEY DON'T LIKE MY CHARACTER, KISS MY ASS. Phil: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALSO GOOD. I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH MY KIDS. AND HOW MANY PEOPLE GET TO DO THIS? WELL, LISTEN, I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS A GREAT SEASON THIS YEAR. HOPEFULLY WE CAN GO OUT AND GET IT DONE. WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE SKIPPER STYLE OVER HERE. Keith: ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE PUT IT RIGHT THERE. GET THEM ALL IN THERE ALL AT ONCE. I'M BURNING. HEY, GOOD LUCK THIS SEASON. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE NICE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERING ] Narrator: LATER THAT NIGHT... WE'RE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD THIS YEAR GOING INTO THE SEASON. Johnathan: YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOD AND THE CAPTAIN? Phil: WHAT'S THAT? EVEN GOD KNOWS HE'S NOT A CAPTAIN. ...THE FINAL ORDER OF BUSINESS -- THIS SEASON'S CAPTAINS' WAGER. SO, THE RULES -- YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A 6 1/2-BY, AND YOU'RE GONNA HAUL IT FIVE TIMES. THE FIRST FIVE TIMES YOU HAUL IT ARE THE FIVE SCORES YOU GET. SO THAT'S IT. AND WE DESIGNATE THE POT. YEAH. IT HAS TO BE THE SAME 6 1/2-BY. YOU CAN SOAK IT AS LONG AS YOU WANT? WHATEVER YOU WANT. YEAH, YOU CAN SOAK IT FOR A MONTH. NOW, IN THE EVENT THAT YOUR POT IS LOST, YOU'RE OUT. YOU ONLY GET -- OH, YEAH. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IF THE WIZARD RUNS MY POT OVER? THEN YOU'RE DONE. HOW MUCH YOU GUYS WANT TO ANTE UP? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO THROW IN THERE? 1,000 BUCKS. LET'S MAKE IT INTERESTING. A GRAND? YEP. $1,000 A BOAT. THAT'S A GOOD BET. GUYS... THAT IS A WIN. THAT'S A [BLEEP] GOOD BET. Narrator: THE CREW WHO RAKES IN THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF KEEPERS IN FIVE SEPARATELY DESIGNATED CAPTAIN'S POTS WILL WIN $4,000. LET'S GET A ROUND OF DUCK FARTS. ALL RIGHT. THE SKIPPERS SEAL THE DEAL WITH A TRADITIONAL DUCK FART -- A HEALTHY MIXTURE OF BAILEYS AND CROWN ROYAL. HERE'S TO MUD IN YOUR EYE. HEY, GUYS, STAY SAFE OUT THERE. THANK YOU. I WILL. OH, YOU BASTARD. REFILL THIS. [ LAUGHS ] HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. [ LAUGHS ] DON'T EVER LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. HEY! [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, MAN! THAT ALL YOU GOT? [ CHEERING, LAUGHTER ] [ GULLS CALLING ] [ SEALS BARKING ] Man:  GALE WARNING FOR TUESDAY. Narrator: 9:00 A.M. SO, I'M READY TO GO. I'M READY TO CATCH SOME CRAB. Narrator: OPENING DAY. WITH ONLY FOUR HOURS UNTIL THE SKIPPERS LEAVE THE SAFETY OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE COUNTDOWN TO THE 2008 ALASKAN KING CRAB SEASON OFFICIALLY BEGINS. HEY, YOU GUYS, HURRY IT UP AND GET THOSE FREAKIN' POTS ON BOARD. WE GOT TO GET GOING. STACKING ON THE GEAR. [ BEEPING ] I BEEN READY FOR MONTHS TO GO FISHING. IT'S TIME TO MAKE SOME MONEY TO PAY THE BILLS. GOOD. Narrator: ACROSS THE DOCKS, THE TIME BANDIT CREW HUSTLES TO STACK ON THE LAST 20 POTS. AROUND HERE, IT'S WHO CAN DO IT THE FIRST, THE FASTEST. THE LAST OF OUR CRAB POTS ARE ON THE DOCK. WE'RE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. GET THAT FILED DOWN AND COME OVER AND HELP ME. I'M JUST A SPRING CHICKEN, RUSSELL. I KNOW. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN ME. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND MIKE IS I KNOW WHEN TO SIT DOWN. Narrator: CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN HAS REHIRED SEASONED DECKHAND 28-YEAR-OLD MIKE FOURTNER. Johnathan: THE REASON WHY WE NEED MIKE BACK IS BECAUSE HE RUNS THIS BOAT IN THE SUMMER. AND US BROTHERS DON'T WANT TO DO THAT DUTY ANYMORE, 'CAUSE WE'RE GONE FROM TOWN ENOUGH. Narrator: AFTER SITTING OUT TWO KING CRAB SEASONS, MIKE'S RETURNING TO THE DECK, BUT HIS SIGHTS ARE SET ON THE WHEELHOUSE. JOHN AND ANDY -- A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THEY SENT ME TO SEATTLE TO GET MY CAPTAIN'S LICENSE TO BE OFFICIALLY LICENSED TO RUN THIS BOAT. I BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL END UP STAYING HOME IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND WHO RUNS THE BOAT WHEN THEY STAY HOME? WELL, WE'LL SEE. MICHAEL. YEAH? YOU'RE NOT A HILLSTRAND, ARE YOU? NO. MAYBE IF I CHANGE MY NAME TO HILLSTRAND, THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO DRIVE A CRAB BOAT. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: WHO WILL TAKE THE HELM WHEN JOHNATHAN AND ANDY STEP DOWN IS ON THE CREW'S MIND. BUT RIGHT NOW, THEY SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT JUST STAYING EMPLOYED. JOBS AIN'T EASY TO FIND OUT HERE, SO EVERYONE'S GONNA HAVE TO BUCK UP. Narrator: THE NEXT NATURAL MAN IN LINE FOR THE THRONE IS JOHNATHAN'S SON, SCOTT. WHOEVER DOES THE LEAST WORK OUT THERE IS GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB, SO... I CAN'T SAY NOTHING. I WANT MY JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BEST THING I CAN DO IS JUST KEEP A GOOD ATTITUDE. I EITHER LIKE IT, LOVE IT, OR FLY THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. WE GOT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS BOAT. WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS. EVEN IF MY BROTHERS AREN'T DOING THEIR JOB, THEY'RE GONE. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE FAMILY OR WHAT. IT'S THE WAY IT WORKS OUT HERE. WEAKEST LINK, BYE-BYE. THERE GOES MIKE FOURTNER UP IN THE AIR. SET ME DOWN. Narrator: AND IN THE SPIRIT OF EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF... JUST SET ME THE [BLEEP] DOWN! Narrator: ...LET THE GAMES BEGIN. GET THOSE POTS ON! WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! LET'S GO! SET ME THE [BLEEP] DOWN! Narrator: SCOTTY MAY BE AT THE CONTROLS NOW... HE'S DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW, MAN. LET'S GET HIM. ...BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE THE OLDER HILLSTRANDS REMIND MIKE OF HIS PLACE ON THE BOAT. ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GET THIS [BLEEP] [ LAUGHS ] DON'T START IN THE WRONG SPOT. OH, I'M NOT FAST, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. ALL RIGHT. OKAY! [ LAUGHTER ] WELCOME. WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK, MIKE. WELCOME BACK, BABY. THAT'S A LOT OF [BLEEP] FLOUR. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU LOOK LIKE A PANCAKE. THAT TOOK THE AIR OUT OF MY FREAKIN' LUNGS WHEN IT HIT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] WELCOME BACK, MIKE! WELCOME BACK. WE LOVE YOU, MIKE. YEAH! Narrator: WHILE THE HILLSTRANDS GIVE MIKE A WARM WELCOME RECEPTION... DOWN THE DOCK ON THE WIZARD, CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN IS WAITING ON A CALL FROM HIS DOCTOR AND THE RESULTS OF HIS BIOPSY. Monte: IT'S BEEN KIND OF A LONG DAY WAITING FOR THE CALL, YOU KNOW. AND IF HE'S GOT A PROBLEM, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO HOME. I MEAN, I'M PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT HIM, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I -- GOD, I HOPE HE'S OKAY. YOU KNOW, HE'S THE CLOSEST -- THE CLOSEST PERSON TO ME IN THE WHOLE WORLD, YOU KNOW? THIS CALL HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE TOUGHEST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE. [ GULLS CALLING ] [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] Keith: HELLO? Dr. Audia: Keith? YES. Hey, it's Dr. Audia. So, we got your biopsy report back. I mean, it is concerning. It's not normal. But...looks like it came back as mild epithelial dysplasia. It's not cancerous, so relax. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S -- I WAS GONNA SAY THAT'S AN AWFUL LONG WORD. AS SOON AS YOU START PUTTING, YOU KNOW, FOUR OR FIVE SYLLABLES TOGETHER, IT GETS ME CONCERNED. Yeah, yeah, so this is one of those where you kind of get a second chance, you know -- get-out-of-jail-free-card kind of deal. So, see you then. ALL RIGHT. BYE. AH, THAT'S GOOD NEWS. WOW. HELLO? Florence: Yeah. HI, HONEY. I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH DR. AUDIA. AND THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO CANCEROUS TISSUE OR ANYTHING. SO I'M GOOD TO GO ON THAT. ALL RIGHT? [ Sobs ] Okay. I've not shown how much I was worried about this, honey, 'cause I didn't want you to freak out about me. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HIDE IT AS WELL, BUT THEY SAID IT WAS A MILD EPITHELIAL DYSPLASIA, AND IT'S LIKE -- YOU KNOW, HE TOLD ME IT'S BASICALLY A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE CARD. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS SOME -- YOU KNOW, MOUTH'S TRYING TO COMBAT ALL THE POISON I'M PUTTING IN IT. SO, I GOT TO -- I GOT TO QUIT. I LOVE YOU. I love you. Woman: ATTENTION ALL MARINERS,  CHANNELS 6 AND 16. ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF UNALASKA AND THE PORT OF DUTCH HARBOR, PLEASE STAND BY  FOR THE BLESSING OF THE FLEET. ON BEHALF OF THE FAITH COMMUNITY OF UNALASKA, WE WISH TO SHARE THIS BLESSING WITH YOU. OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU  AS YOU LEAVE PORT AND CONTINUE OUR PRAYERS  FOR YOUR SAFE RETURN. WE THANK GOD, THE FATHER,  MAKER OF THE UNIVERSE, FOR THE UNITY AND ORDER  OF CREATED THINGS. WE GIVE THANKS FOR ALL THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH AND SEA, FOR THE SHIPS  WHICH DISTRIBUTE THEM, FOR FISHERMEN  AND ALL WHO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES  TO SERVE OTHERS, FOR THE SKILLS OF SEAMANSHIP, AND FOR ALL ENGAGED  IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY. AS HE WALKED  BY THE SEA OF GALILEE, HE SAW TWO BROTHERS  MENDING THEIR NETS AND CALLING THEM IMMEDIATELY. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] WHAT'S UP? AND HE SAID TO THEM,  "FOLLOW ME, AND I WILL MAKE YOU  FISHERS OF MEN." IMMEDIATELY THEY LEFT  THEIR NETS AND FOLLOWED HIM. NO. NO WAY. JESUS UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFICULTY  AND HAZARDS OF FISHING AND PERHAPS WANTED  TO COMMUNICATE THAT CHALLENGE FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW HIM. WELL, WHAT DOES THAT EXACTLY MEAN? THERE'S STILL SOME BLOOD CLOT -- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? AS YOU LEAVE PORT,  UNDERSTAND THAT CHRIST HIMSELF UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFICULTIES  OF THE WORK, AND AS WE SHARE  THIS LESSON... AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO FISH, OR WHAT? THIS IS MY CAREER, MAN. WE THANK GOD FOR FISHERMEN AND FOR ALL ENGAGED  IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY. WE PRAY  FOR OUR OWN COUNTRY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN DIE? LET US PRAY. CREATOR AND FATHER OF ALL,  WE PRAY FOR THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA  IN SHIPS AND SERVE YOU  UPON THE BERING SEA. WELL, I GOT A BOATLOAD OF PEOPLE HERE THAT ARE ALL DEPENDING ON ME TO GO FISHING. MAY THE SPIRIT  CARRY YOU SAFE. OKAY. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. JESUS. [ SIGHS ] WE ARE OFFICIALLY READY TO SET SAIL. Sig: ALL RIGHT, WE'RE OFF. WE ARE OUT OF HERE. WE ARE OFFICIALLY GONE FISHING. Johnathan: COME ON, GUYS. KICK SOME ASS. [ GULLS CALLING ] IT'S GO TIME, BABY. GO TIME. SO, WE GOT A TIGHT START, GUYS. Phil: THAT WAS THE DOCTOR, AND HE JUST SAYS, "YOU KNOW, YOU GO OUT, YOU'RE TAKING A GREAT BIG CHANCE ON SOMETHING GOING WRONG." I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO. WHAT AM I GONNA DO? Narrator: AT THE DOCKS IN DUTCH HARBOR, CAPTAIN PHIL IS WRESTLING WITH A LIFE-OR-DEATH DECISION. Phil: SO, WHAT'S UP? IS THIS IT? AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO FISH, OR WHAT? NEW TEST RESULTS SHOW PHIL'S STILL NOT OUT OF THE WOODS. THE TRIP TO SEA COULD KILL HIM. Phil: I MEAN, THIS IS MY LIVELIHOOD, MAN. I MEAN, IF YOU STAY BACK AND DON'T GO NOW, AM I DONE? AM I OVER? I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT THERE AND HAVE SOMETHING GO WRONG. IT CERTAINLY ISN'T WORTH IT. WELL, I GOT TO GO DOWN AND TALK TO THESE GUYS, AND I GOT TO TALK TO MURRAY, AND...GOD. HEY, FELLAS. EVERYBODY WANT TO COME OVER AND SIT DOWN FOR A SECOND? UH, THE DOCTOR JUST CALLED, AND, UH, I STILL HAVE SOME PROBLEMS. I HAVE SOME BLOOD CLOTS, AND IT'S BEST THAT I DON'T GO FISHING. I MEAN, SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN AND EITHER BLEED TO DEATH OUT THERE OR HAVE ANOTHER EMBOLISM. I'M JUST SHAKEN. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GONNA BE A-OKAY AND WE WERE ALL GOOD, AND EVERYTHING ISN'T SO OKAY. WILL YOU TAKE THE BOAT? WELL, OF COURSE, I'LL TAKE THE BOAT FOR YOU. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE BOAT. I'M SORRY, GUYS. HEY, THANKS. Gamrath: I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE OKAY, BECAUSE I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THIS, SO... Josh: UNEXPECTED. UNEXPECTED. Jake: KIND OF SAD NEWS. HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT HE'S BEEN CHANGING HIS DIET AND DOING A COUPLE MORE THINGS, YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S BEEN SO LONG THAT HE'S GOT TO START DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE, YOU KNOW. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO START DOING SOME MAJOR LIFE CHANGES. BUT WE'RE GONNA MISS HIM WHEN WE'RE OUT FISHING. Phil: GOD, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO. I JUST NEVER LET MY BRAIN GO THERE THAT I COULDN'T GO. YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS MANAGED TO PULL IT OFF, ALWAYS, NO MATTER WHAT. THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER DONE. THAT'S MY WHOLE LIFE. AND IT'S GOING AWAY. [ HORN BLOWS ] IT'S ALL COMING DOWN, COMING UNGLUED. Narrator: AFTER STEAMING AHEAD FOR 20 HOURS, ONE BOAT IS THE FIRST TO COVER THE 200 MILES AND REACH THE FISHING GROUNDS. JUST YELL AT ME WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT READY, AND I'LL TELL YOU TO DUMP IT. Man: ROGER. Andy: OKAY. Narrator: THE TIME BANDIT IS ON THE SOUTHERN END OF THE CRAB GROUNDS. AND CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN IS LOOKING FOR LIGHTNING TO STRIKE TWICE IN THE SAME PLACE. Johnathan: AND THIS IS WHERE WE FOUND THE CRAB LAST YEAR. THEY FILLED THE BOAT UP IN 30 HOURS. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN OUT HERE CRAB FISHING FOR 28 YEARS, AND I KNOW WHICH WAY THESE LITTLE BASTARDS ARE MOVING RIGHT NOW, THIS IS RIGHT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. KNOCKING ON WOOD. Narrator: JOHNATHAN PLANS TO SET OUT TWO 10-POT PROSPECT STRINGS. JUST LET HER RIP. Fourtner: SHOW ON THE ROAD. YEAH! WATCH YOUR FEET! Narrator: WITH THE FIRST POT OFF THE LAUNCHER, THE TIME BANDIT'S 2008 KING CRAB SEASON OFFICIALLY BEGINS. JUST LIKE THAT. Johnathan: CRAB FISH -- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL YEAR TO DO. GOING OVER. GOING OVER. YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] DUMP ANOTHER ONE IF YOU'RE READY. ROGER! RIGHT ON, BUDDY. GOING OVER. IT'S GOING OVER. Narrator: STEAMING TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN END OF THE FISHING GROUNDS 120 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST IS THE 155-FOOT WIZARD. OKAY, WE GOT TO STRETCH THEM OUT ABOUT A POT A MILE OR SO, RIGHT, GARY? Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN HOPES HIS LUCK CONTINUES AND HEDGES HIS BETS ON ONE OF LAST YEAR'S FISHING HOLES. Keith: WE HAD GEAR THROUGH HERE LAST YEAR. WE DIDN'T CATCH SQUAT. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE CRAB AREN'T GONNA BE HERE THIS YEAR, SO I'M THINKING THIS IS JUST AN AREA I NEED TO COVER JUST IN CASE. PULL! GET YOUR BAIT SET UP,  ONE ON EACH TUNNEL, SPREAD OUT REALLY WELL, RIGHT? ROGER. THEY'RE ALL GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. YOU REACH UP, JUST SNAP, SNAP. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH," BAD CRABBING... IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR. Narrator: ...LEAVES A BAD TASTE. [ SPITS ] Narrator: AND LATER... Man: GET HIM OUT. ...A SKIPPER DOWN. Narrator: 289 MILES TO THE NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. AS DAWN BREAKS ON THE BERING SEA, CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN HAS BROKEN AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE FLEET. Sig: NOT A LOT OF GUYS AROUND THIS AREA. I'M NORTHEAST OF ALL THE GUYS THAT WERE DOWN BY THE ISLAND. IT'S JUST I WANT TO START FROM HERE, RUN UP THE LINE, AND THEN JUST SPREAD THEM OUT. AND HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, WE FIND SOMETHING. Narrator: BUT FIRST IT'S TIME TO HONOR THE BOAT'S LONGEST STANDING NORWEGIAN TRADITION. Sig: THE GUYS REMEMBERED TO BITE THE HEAD OFF THE HERRING THIS YEAR. AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA DRAW STRAWS, 'CAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO BITE THE HEAD OFF THE THING THIS TIME AROUND. HEY. WE'RE GONNA DRAW ZIP TIES FOR THE HERRING. AND THEY CHALLENGED ME TO GO DOWN THERE AND DO IT. I MEAN, I'M A FISHERMAN, SO WHY NOT? I JUST DON'T WANT TO DRAW THE SHORT STRAW. PUT A WHITE ONE IN THERE. YOU READY TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM? ALL RIGHT. YOU RIGGED IT. NO. NO, THERE'S NO WAY. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX. THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT LENGTHS. LET ME MIX THEM. I DON'T TRUST YOU. WELL, I DON'T TRUST YOU. YOU'RE THE SKIPPER. I WANT TO GO FIRST. YOU WANT TO GO FIRST? CAPTAIN FIRST. WELL, YEAH, 'CAUSE, I MEAN, I GOT MORE CHANCES OF NOT GETTING IT. Man: SEE, THAT'S WHY THE CANVAS BAG IS THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] AH! [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOD, NO WAY. YEAH! YEAH! YOU GOT THE SHORT ONE. YOU GOT THE SHORT ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. YEAH. [ SPITTING ] [ CHEERING, LAUGHTER ] THAT TASTES LIKE CRAP. Man: THAT WAS THE BEST. HE HAD SIX CHANCES. DUDE, IF THAT'S THE WAY MY LUCK IS GONNA GO, THAT'S NOT GOOD. OH, THAT'S NASTY. THOSE GUYS. THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN LOSE NOW. OH, YEAH. NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO GET ALL PUMPED UP. THAT WAS BADASS. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. READY TO GO CRAB FISHING? [ CHEERING ] Edgar: RIGHT ON. LET HER GO. FIRST POT. NORTHWESTERN! NOW MY COFFEE TASTES LIKE HERRING. Narrator: 100 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST, ON THE WIZARD... I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THESE FIRST TWO STRINGS. WE'LL SEE. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN KEITH APPROACHES HIS FIRST PROSPECT POT AFTER LETTING IT SOAK FOR 14 HOURS. ABOUT TO THROW THE HOOK ON THE FIRST TEST POT OF THE SEASON. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] Keith: WHO'S CALLING ME NOW? KEITH'S WIFE, WHO ALSO HELPS RUN HIS BOOKS, HAS SOME BAD NEWS. HE'S BROKE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT SUCKS, BECAUSE THAT MEANS WE'RE DIPPING INTO MONEY THAT WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING INTO. HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT TO GET GOING. I GOT TO GET BUSY HERE. Keith: THIS YEAR, CATCHING MY QUOTA IN A TIMELY MANNER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. Man: THIS IS IT. THIS IS A NICE SHOT. I WON'T MISS THIS ONE, KNOCK ON WOOD. Narrator: KEITH POURED OVER $400,000 INTO THE BOAT. NOW HE NEEDS TO START MAKING IT BACK... FAST. [BLEEP] DAMN IT. I GUESS WE'RE NOT HITTING THEM FOR THE TIME BEING. I GOT FAITH. I GOT FAITH. Monte: OPTIMISM IS KEY. MORE POTS, MORE GEAR TO HAUL, AND WE WILL FIND THEM. Man: OUT OF THESE POTS, HOW MANY YOU THINK WE'LL GET? ONE KEEPER. WE KEEP THESE NUMBERS, WE'LL BE HERE UNTIL FEBRUARY. Keith: THE FIRST FIVE POTS OF THE SEASON HAVE COME BACK ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, ONE, AND A WHOPPING THREE COUNT. NOT LOOKING GOOD. Man: SO OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE THUS FAR ISN'T SLEEP DEPRIVATION OR STARVATION, IT'S FINDING THE CRAB. Keith: I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT WARRANTS TRYING TO LEAVE ANY GEAR HERE. SO WE'RE THROWING IT ALL ON AND MOVING UP THE HILL WITH IT. THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR TO START THIS SEASON. Narrator: COMING UP, STRAIN...AND STRESS. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. YOU GOT TO BE [BLEEP] KIDDING ME! I GOT TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE [BLEEP] THIS IS. I'M OUT OF HERE. IT'S JUST A TINT OF RED SKIES IN THE MORNING. SAILORS TAKE WARNING. SO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BLOW, I GUESS. BUT IT'S SURE BEAUTIFUL NOW. Narrator: 255 MILES TO THE NORTH, CORNELIA MARIE RELIEF SKIPPER MURRAY GAMRATH FINALLY ARRIVES AT THE FISHING GROUNDS. THEY JUST PUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY INTO THE BOAT THIS YEAR. QUICKER I CAN CATCH IT, THE MORE MONEY WE'RE GONNA MAKE. Phil: I'VE NEVER MISSED A KING CRAB SEASON IN 33 YEARS, SO I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO MISSING THIS ONE. Gamrath: THE ONE THING I HAVE TO DO IS TO GET MYSELF IN A FISHING MIND-SET NOW. AND THAT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT, 'CAUSE I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THIS. I HOPE THOSE GUYS ARE DOING WELL OUT THERE. OKAY. Narrator: 70 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, ON THE WIZARD, CAPTAIN KEITH'S LUCK HASN'T IMPROVED. Keith: WE'VE BEEN STACKING AND NOT REALLY HAULING A WHOLE LOT OF PRODUCTIVE GEAR. I FEEL LIKE THE CLOCK IS TICKING. I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE WE'VE BEEN SPINNING OUR WHEELS. [ CREAKING ] YOU GOT TO BE [BLEEP] KIDDING ME! RIGHT AT THE BRIDLE? RIGHT AT THE KNOT? DID IT GET CUT? WHAT HAPPENED? Narrator: THE INCH-AND-A-HALF-THICK LINE SNAPS. THE POT, ALONG WITH ITS KING CRAB BOUNTY, FALLS BACK INTO THE OCEAN. YOU SEE, THAT'S A BRAND-NEW CUT. THIS IS -- IT'S A ZINC, RIGHT? THAT'S A ZINC. KEITH SUSPECTS A JAGGED EDGE OF STEEL ATTACHING ONE OF THE ZINCS TO THE HULL IS CHAFING THE LINES. AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE LOSING POTS. THE WIZARD HAS 30-INCH ZINC PLATES ATTACHED TO ITS STEEL HULL. THE ZINC IS CALLED A SACRIFICIAL METAL, WHICH MEANS IT SACRIFICES ITSELF TO CORROSION WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE EAT AWAY AT THE HULL. OH, IT'S GONNA TAKE OUT [BLEEP] THE WHOLE LINE, AND WE'RE GONNA LOSE GEAR. I MEAN, THE LAST POT WE LOST WAS 2 GRAND. WE COULD LOSE MORE MONEY EVERY DAY ON THAT THAN WE COULD MAKE MONEY. NOW, WITH NO MONEY IN THE BANK, KEITH CANNOT AFFORD TO SACRIFICE ANY MORE OF HIS GEAR. STOP, STOP, STOP. IS THAT CUTTING IT RIGHT NOW? IT IS, ISN'T IT? Narrator: FISHING COMES TO A GRINDING HALT. Keith: I'M GONNA GET SCREWED, MAN. I'M GONNA END UP HAVING TO DRIVE THIS BOAT ALL THE WAY TO TOWN AND LOSE TWO DAYS OF FISHING BECAUSE OF THAT DAMN SNAG ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT. PROBABLY COST ME 50 GRAND IN THE PROCESS. Narrator: KEITH'S ONLY OPTION, BESIDES THROWING IN THE TOWEL, IS AN OPEN-WATER DIVE IN THE BERING SEA. Keith: I'VE NEVER DOVE ON A BOAT OUT HERE, DRIFTING AROUND. IT'S JUST KIND OF GNARLY BECAUSE THE BOAT'S DOING THIS, AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR NEUTRAL BUOYANCY UNDERWATER. YOU GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT YOU DON'T, YOU KNOW, GET SLAMMED OR SMASHED UP AGAINST THE BOAT. Narrator: NOW, KEITH'S DECISION -- EMPTY BANK OR EMPTY TANK? AS THE FIRST POTS OF THE SEASON ARE SET OUT TO SOAK, THE WIZARD IS THE FIRST TO PULL THE KING CRAB BOUNTY ABOARD. Narrator: 210 MILES TO THE NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT HAS ARRIVED AT THE TOP OF ONE OF ITS TEST STRINGS. THIS IS RIGHT ABOUT 2 MILES FROM WHERE WE HAD OUR HOT SPOT LAST YEAR. OH! LOOK AT THAT SHOT! Narrator: CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN HAULS ON AN 18-HOUR SOAK. I SEE WHITE. WHITE IS GOOD. [ CHEERING ] OH, YEAH! YEAH, MAN! [BLEEP] DANG! SPANKING THEM BAD, BABY! THAT'S OVER 100. [ LAUGHS ] [ CHEERING ] SAME SPOT AS LAST YEAR, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. YEAH! I GOT TO GO OUTSIDE, MAN. THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. Johnathan: YEAH, RUSSELL. JOHN WAYNE, RIGHT HERE -- JOHN WAYNE HILLSTRAND. Narrator: THE FIRST POT OVER THE RAIL HAS $3,000 WORTH OF KEEPERS. WELL, WE'RE STARTING THE SAME WAY WE LEFT OFF LAST YEAR. THAT'S GOOD FUN. I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO A BETTER BUNCH OF GUYS. 96! 96! OH, 96, BABY! Narrator: NOW, WITH THE REMAINING 102 POTS HE HAS ON DECK, JOHNATHAN PLANS ON CARPET-BOMBING THE AREA. [BLEEP] LANDED RIGHT ON THEM THIS YEAR. THEY WERE IN THE SAME SPOT AS THEY WERE LAST YEAR. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME. OFF TO THE BEST START WE'VE EVER HAD. I GOT THE BEST CREW I'VE EVER HAD. BEST WEATHER WE'VE EVER HAD. SO WE'RE HAPPY. WE'RE HAPPY ON THIS BOAT. LET THE GAMES BEGIN. Narrator: BUT NOT EVERYONE IS EXPERIENCING JOHNATHAN'S GOOD FORTUNE. 152 MILES TO THE EAST, THE WIZARD DRIFTS IN 5-FOOT SWELLS. Keith: I MEAN, I'VE DOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE, BUT NOT ON A 150-FOOT BOAT IN 42-DEGREE WATER TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BERING SEA. Narrator: FEELING THE CRUNCH OF THE BANK, EMPTY CRAB TANKS, AND THE POTENTIAL OF LOSING MORE GEAR, CAPTAIN KEITH DECIDES TO DIVE. YOU GOT IT! Man: ALL KINDS OF DANGEROUS STUFF CAN HAPPEN DIVING BY A BOAT. THIS IS NO JOKING MATTER. WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHILE WE'RE DOING THIS. Man #2: THERE'S ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT CAN GO WRONG. STUFF HAPPENS ALL THE TIME ON THE WATER. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS PROBABLY NOT CONSIDERED THE SAFEST THING IN THE WORLD. THE BOAT -- AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S HEAVING PRETTY GOOD. SO, I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT A MOVING OBJECT LIKE THIS. THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN. IT'S JUST THE BOAT DOING [BLEEP] Narrator: KEITH'S ONLY LIFELINE IS AN INCH-THICK ROPE THAT RUNS UNDERNEATH THE BOAT. WITHOUT THE TAG LINE, I'M ON MY OWN. ON THREE. ONE. TWO. Narrator: KEITH DESCENDS TO A PLACE FROM WHERE FEW MEN RETURN -- THE BERING SEA. BENEATH THE HEAVING HULL, KEITH FINDS THE LOOSE ZINC THAT HAS BEEN CUTTING INTO HIS LINES. GOOD NEWS -- THE ZINC IS STILL ATTACHED. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS KEITH THOUGHT. Monte: OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF STRESS FROM DOING THIS. I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM. Narrator: BUT AS KEITH STARTS HEADING TO THE SURFACE, THE 499-TON VESSEL TAKES A ROLL RIGHT INTO THE SKIPPER'S SKULL. Man: RIGHT HERE. HE'S COMING UP. Man #2: ALL RIGHT, I SEE HIM. YEAH, HE'S RIGHT HERE. Monte: YOU ALL RIGHT? I JUST NEED TO GET OUT OF THE WATER. ROGER. I [BLEEP] SLAMMED MY HEAD COMING OUT. Man: GET HIM OUT. WE GOT THE LIFE SLING COMING. HOW IS HE, CROSBY? [ GROANS ] KEITH, YOU OKAY? KEITH, YOU ALL RIGHT? [BLEEP] BLEEDING BADLY. [BLEEP] NAILED YOURSELF. KEEP HIM DOWN. WHY DON'T YOU JUST KEEP SEATED FOR A SECOND? STAY DOWN FOR A LITTLE BIT. Man: WHY NOT? WHY NOT? KEITH, YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.
