 [ MID-TEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ] [ RADIO CHATTER ] JUST THREE DAYS INTO THE OPILIO CRAB SEASON, THE COAST GUARD WAS CALLED FOR AN EMERGENCY RESCUE AT SEA. A CREWMAN ABOARD THE 304-FOOT VESSEL ISLAND ENTERPRISE HAS SUFFERED A SERIES OF LIFE-THREATENING SEIZURES AND MUST BE EVACED TO A MEDICAL FACILITY. Roger. The door is open. WITH ROLLING SEAS AND WINDS GUSTING TO 40 KNOTS, THE COAST GUARD HAS LIMITED TIME FOR A BASKET RESCUE. Roger. Forward and right. Okay. WITH CREWMAN RAFAEL OROSCO IN THE CHOPPER, SWIMMER LUKE CORDERONE QUICKLY ADMINISTERS MEDICAL ATTENTION

 TO TRY AND STABILIZE THE PATIENT. Refer to the read-back. Okay. Narrator: BUT OROSCO IS STILL AT RISK FOR SUFFERING ANOTHER SEIZURE OR GOING INTO ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. THEIR ORDERS FROM THE BASE ARE TO AIRLIFT THE PATIENT TO COLD BAY, 235 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST. AGAINST PILOT TODD BLOCH'S BETTER JUDGMENT, THEY SET A COURSE FOR COLD BAY, TWO HOURS AWAY, DIRECTLY THROUGH THE HEART OF A MASSIVE STORM FRONT. WITHIN MINUTES, THE JAYHAWK RESCUE HELICOPTER BEGINS TO ICE OVER. Thanks, man. IF THE DEICING APPARATUS FAILS, ICE WILL CLOG THE JET'S AIR-INTAKE SYSTEM, SUFFOCATING THE ENGINE, FORCING A STALL. THE JAYHAWK WILL LOSE ALTITUDE AND, AT WORST, CRASH. PILOT NASHON ALMINA TRIES TO CONTACT BASE TO REPORT THEIR SITUATION. Lor sta St. Paul, Lor sta St. Paul. Coast Guard rescue 6035, channel 2, live, over. BUT THERE'S NO RESPONSE. Lor sta St. Paul, Lor sta St. Paul. Coast Guard rescue 6035, rescue 6035. Lor sta St. Paul, Lor sta St. Paul. Coast Guard rescue 6035, channel 2, live, over. So, try to call anyone else you can. Rescue 6035. WITHOUT ORDERS FROM BASE, THE COAST GUARD TEAM NOW FACES AN IMPOSSIBLE DECISION... ...RISK EVERYONE'S LIFE ON BOARD TO SAVE ONE MAN, OR RISK LOSING THE PATIENT TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE CREW. THEY RECHECK OROSCO'S VITAL SIGNS. FOR THE MOMENT, THE PATIENT REMAINS STABLE. BUILDING ICE IS WEIGHING THE CHOPPER DOWN. AND COMBINED WITH THE 40-KNOT HEADWINDS, THEIR PROGRESS SLOWS TO A CRAWL. PILOT BLOCH QUESTIONS WHETHER THEY EVEN HAVE ENOUGH FUEL TO MAKE IT. WITH THE WIND AT THEIR BACK, THE JAYHAWK MAKES THE RUN TO ST. PAUL IN JUST 40 MINUTES. RAFAEL OROSCO IS STILL IN STABLE CONDITION. BUT THERE'S NO PLANE ON HAND TO FLY OROSCO TO ANCHORAGE. FINALLY, AFTER A TWO-HOUR WAIT, RAFAEL GETS A LUCKY BREAK, THIS TIME FROM A GOOD SAMARITAN. THEY HAVE A CARGO AIRCRAFT HERE, SO THEY CAN'T NORMALLY CARRY PASSENGERS BUT GOT A WAIVER FROM THE FAA TO CARRY THE PERSON THEY MEDEVACED OFF OF THE ISLAND ENTERPRISE. [ SIREN CHIRPS ] Narrator: COMING UP... IT'S REALLY GETTING WINDY -- 70, 80. Narrator: ...HIGH WINDS AND A SHREDDING ANCHOR LINE PUT A SKIPPER BETWEEN A HARD PLACE... Phil: THIS IS A REAL TRICKY SPOT. Narrator: ...AND THE ROCKS. Josh: I MEAN, THIS AIN'T NO JOKE. US BEING ON THE BEACH COULD REALLY [BLEEP] THINGS UP. Narrator: 279 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR... THE CORNELIA MARIE IS DOWN AN ENGINE, LIMPING THROUGH 25-FOOT SEAS AND 40-KNOT WINDS. CAPTAIN PHIL IS ON A MISSION TO REACH ST. PAUL AND THE SAFETY OF HER HARBOR. Phil: IT'S GETTING [BLEEP] BAD. YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THESE WAVES COMING BY? [ ALARM RINGS ] Narrator: 12 HOURS AGO, ONE OF THE BOAT'S TWO ENGINES OVERHEATED, AND PHIL WAS LEFT WITH NO OPTION BUT TO SHUT HER DOWN. IT'S JUST A [BLEEP] DEAL. I'M DISGUSTED. Narrator: NOW, AFTER SIX GRUELING HOURS BATTLING THE HEAVY SEAS, PHIL STEERS THE CRIPPLED BOAT BACK INTO THE SAFETY OF ZOLOTOI BAY, NEAR ST. PAUL ISLAND. Phil: IT'S REALLY GETTING WINDY. THE WAY THIS WIND'S GONNA BLOW WILL SHOOT US RIGHT OVER HERE, WHICH IS THAT BEACH RIGHT OVER THERE. I DON'T WANT TO PARTICULARLY BE THERE. I MEAN, THIS AIN'T NO JOKE. US BEING ON THE BEACH COULD REALLY [BLEEP] THINGS UP. Man:  WEATHER SOURCE AT ANCHORAGE  HAS ISSUED A HIGH-WIND WARNING. HIGH-WIND WARNING  IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT. WE'RE GONNA HANG OUT HERE TILL IT'S SAFE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN GET FROM HERE TO DUTCH HARBOR SO WE CAN TEND TO OUR ENGINE. Narrator: HIDING OUT IS STILL A GAMBLE. POWERFUL WINDS AND TIDES CAN SHOVE THEM INTO THE JAGGED SHORELINE. WITH THE ANCHOR SECURE, CAPTAIN PHIL ORDERS HIS SON, JOSH, TO TAKE THE FIRST WATCH. OKAY, YOU'RE UP. REALLY PAY ATTENTION. WE'RE FLOPPING AROUND. OKAY. YOU KNOW, ONE JERK, AND IT'LL BUST THAT CABLE, AND WE'LL START GOING BACKWARDS. I GOT TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY. ROGER. IT DON'T GET MUCH WILDER THAN THIS. Narrator: JOSH'S JOB WILL BE TO ENSURE THE 300-TON CORNELIA MARIE DOESN'T GO ADRIFT AND ONTO THE ROCKS. [ CREAKING ] HOLD ON. Man: DID IT BREAK? YEAH, IT DID. [ Telephone rings ] Phil: Yeah? Wow. [ CREAKING ] Narrator: MURRAY IS FORCED TO START THE BOAT'S BAD ENGINE TO HELP LOOSEN THE TENSION ON THE ANCHOR CABLE. THE CREW CAREFULLY WINCHES THE ANCHOR UP TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE. [ MACHINERY HUMS ] IF THE CABLE SNAPS WHILE THEY'RE WINCHING IT IN, IT COULD WHIP ACROSS THE BOW AND SLICE A DECKHAND IN HALF. Phil: THIS IS A REAL TRICKY SPOT. Narrator: DECKHAND DAVE MILLMAN GETS THE FIRST LOOK. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] YEAH? MILLMAN: It went out, like, two more wraps is all, but I don't want to get any closer. No. That's fine. HOW MUCH ARE WE GONNA LOSE OFF THAT CABLE? CAN YOU CUT THE BAD SPOT OUT, OR DO WE HAVE TO JUST GET ANOTHER CABLE? Uh... WE'LL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER CABLE, HUH? More than likely, yeah. Narrator: PHIL'S SONS QUICKLY TIE A BUOY TO THE ANCHOR. IN A WORST-CASE SCENARIO, AT LEAST THE $6,000 GRAPPLE COULD BE RETRIEVED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'RE GONNA GET TO DUTCH HARBOR. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE BOAT WILL GET FIXED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'LL MAKE IT BACK OUT HERE. Narrator: PHIL HUNKERS DOWN AND PREPARES TO RIDE OUT THE REST OF THE STORM ON A BAD ENGINE AND AN ANCHOR HANGING BY A THREAD. COMING UP, TOO MANY COOKS ON THE TIME BANDIT. IT'S ANDY THAT'S THE CAPTAIN. OKAY. IT'S DYING OFF RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN LEAVE ONE A MILE DOWN, STACK BAD ONES. DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO. Narrator: 295 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, NORTHWESTERN CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN APPROACHES THE FIRST POTS OF THE SEASON HE SET IN LAST NIGHT'S STORM. THE NORTHWESTERN WAS BATTLING 20-FOOT SEAS AND WAS FORCED TO BLINDLY SPLASH 100 POTS. Sig: I NEED TO SET HERE. AND TO BE QUITE HONEST, I DON'T CARE WHERE IT ENDS UP. I JUST WANT TO GET IT OFF THE DECK. IT'S A LOT SAFER. DON'T MISS, JAKE. IT'S PRETTY FREAKING IMPORTANT YOU DON'T MISS. FIRST POT COMING UP HERE. YEAH, I COULDN'T HAVE MADE IT MUCH EASIER FOR YOU. I DON'T EXPECT THE FIRST POT'S GONNA MAKE OR BREAK OUR SEASON, BUT WE'LL SEE. Man: MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY! Man #2: I SEE CRABS. COME ON. COME ON! I SEE CRAB. OH, YEAH! I SEE SOME CRAB. [ GRUNTS ] NICE AND CLEAN-LOOKING. NOT BAD! NOT BAD! GET OPIES SORTED ON THE TABLE. MATT'S NAME IS THE SHOVELER. THAT'S 'CAUSE HE'S REALLY FAST. KNEE-DEEP IN CRAB. RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE WE GOT LUCKY AND LANDED ON THEM OR AT LEAST SOME REALLY GOOD SPOTS RIGHT OFF THE BAT. AND NOW WE'RE GETTING A FEEL FOR WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU COULD DIAL IN. SO IT JUST -- IT CLICKS THAT MUCH FASTER. Narrator: AS THE CREW PICKS THEIR WAY THROUGH MOUNTAINS OF OPILIO GOLD, A COILED SHOT ON TOP OF A POT BEHIND THEM FALLS ON DECK... ...NORMALLY NOT A BIG DEAL, UNLESS THE LINE IS SUCKED INTO THE BYCATCH CHUTE WHERE FEMALES AND JUVENILES ARE WASHED BACK INTO THE OCEAN. AS SOON AS THE LINE IS SUCKED DOWN THE CHUTE, IT QUICKLY TRAVELS TO THE STERN, WHERE IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BECOME TANGLED IN THE CHURNING PROPELLER. WHEN ROPE PULLS TAUT, THE 800-POUND POT IT'S TIED TO BECOMES A RUNAWAY STEEL BATTERING RAM ON DECK. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] LOOK ALIVE! YEAH. EDGAR'S QUICK THINKING KEPT A FREAK ACCIDENT FROM TURNING FATAL. OH, YOU GET THESE WAVES COME OVER, TAKES THE COIL OFF THE TOP OF THE POT, UNDER THE TABLE, RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOAT. THE PROBLEM IS IT CAN GO THAT FAR DOWN TO GETTING IN OUR PROP. AND THAT WOULD BE, LIKE, REALLY BAD. YOU'D HAVE A POT TRYING TO GET SUCKED DOWN A HOLE THIS BIG. Man: I'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME, AND I AIN'T NEVER SEEN A LINE GO OUT THAT [BLEEP] CHUTE, NEVER ONCE. Narrator: WITH THE DISASTER AVERTED AND A CLEAR-WEATHER WINDOW AHEAD OF THEM, THE CREW GETS BACK TO THE GRIND. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN PULL GEAR AND THE WEATHER PERMITS IT, YOU KIND OF WANT TO DO THAT. IF YOU HAVE THE SCHEDULE AND SAY YOU'RE GONNA PULL GEAR ON THIS DAY, YOU MIGHT AS WELL TOSS IT OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE THE WEATHERMAN MIGHT SAY DIFFERENT. Man: THEY SAY YOUR FIRST DAY OF FISHING'S USUALLY THE LONGEST. IT'LL BE A LONG DAY. Narrator: 85 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, THE TIME BANDIT IS ENJOYING A BERING SEA SUNRISE... AND CALMER WATERS AFTER BEING BATTERED BY THE LAST STORM. THE FLAG TOOK A BEATING ON THIS TRIP, THAT'S FOR SURE. THE WHOLE BOAT TOOK A BEATING. IF YOU LOOKED INSIDE MY STOMACH RIGHT NOW, I WOULD BE THAT FLAG LAST NIGHT. BL-BL-BL-BL! OH, YEAH, MAN. LAST NIGHT WAS NOT A GOOD NIGHT FOR ME. THAT WAS ROUGHER THAN HELL. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] I HAD TO WATCH OUT FOR EVERY WAVE TO MAKE SURE THESE GUYS DIDN'T GET KILLED. AND THEN WHEN I SEE SCOTTY GOING TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE BOAT ON THE PICKING BOOM HOOK... WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! ...THAT WAS NOT A GOOD FEELING. Narrator: WITH DECK LIGHTS DESTROYED, MISSING DECK BOARDS, AND A SHREDDED FLAG, CAPTAIN ANDY LOOKS FORWARD TO CALMER SEAS. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CHANGES A CREW MEMBER'S ATTITUDE MORE THAN CALM WEATHER AFTER GETTING HIS ASS KICKED. LOOK AT THE 10-FOOT WAVES ROLL BY INSTEAD OF 35-FOOTERS. BAM! MOTHER NATURE'S SMILING UPON US AGAIN. Narrator: NOW ANDY'S FINALLY ABLE TO HAUL SOME GEAR. BUT HE SET THIS STRING ON THE ADVICE FROM OLDER BROTHER JOHNATHAN. CAME DOWN WHERE JOHNATHAN WAS LAST YEAR, WHERE HE JUST FOUND JUST SPECTACULAR FISHING. 'CAUSE I'M PULLING FULL POTS. JOHNATHAN'S ADVICE ISN'T PAYING OFF. ANDY'S AVERAGING ONLY 175 KEEPERS A POT. NOT AS GOOD AS I WAS HOPING TO SEE. 179. PBHT! [ GRUNTS ] THIS IS WHERE HE DID GOOD LAST YEAR. HE HAD 1,100. I'M NOT SEEING IT RIGHT NOW. I MADE THE MOVE TO COME OVER AND LISTEN TO HIM. I WOULD HAVE NEVER SAT HERE. [ LAUGHS ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HERE. OKAY. IT'S DYING OFF RIGHT HERE. WE CAME HERE. WE TRIED JOHN'S SPOT. IT WAS A HOT SPOT LAST YEAR, BUT THAT WAS MARCH -- TWO MONTHS FROM NOW. AND THE CRAB KIND OF MIGRATE DOWN THIS WAY. YOU CAN LEAVE ONE A MILE DOWN, STACK BAD ONES. DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO. [ LAUGHS ] DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO. CRABBING SUCKS! IT SUCKS BAD HERE. CAPTAIN JOHN'S THINKING THROUGH A SEASON RIGHT NOW IN HIS OWN HEAD. THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD RIGHT HERE, MAN. YEAH, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP HIM, BUT I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] HIM UP, CHANGE HIS DESTINY. YOU GOT YOUR BACKSEAT DRIVERS. YOU GOT YOUR BACKSEAT DRIVERS. IT'S ANDY THAT'S THE CAPTAIN. Newberry: HELL, I NEVER KNOW WHO'S IN THE CAPTAIN'S SEAT. I KNOW I ANSWER TO ANDY, BUT SOMETIMES I LOOK UP THERE AND JOHNATHAN'S RUNNING THE BOAT, DRIVING THE BOAT. ONE MORE, HUH? JUST WHEN WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE FUN. IF THE CRAB AREN'T HERE, THE CRAB AREN'T HERE. SO? WE'LL STACK THEM ON, STACK 50 POTS ON, MOVE THEM, STACK ANOTHER 50, MOVE THEM. THAT'S MY PLAN. THAT'S MY MISSION. AND GOD DANG IT, WE'RE GONNA GO DO IT. I'M NOT SAYING A WORD. AH, WE KIND OF TAKE JOHN ALONG FOR, LIKE, A MASCOT, TELLING ME TO GO PLACES, TELLING ME HOW TO FISH. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S TOUGH WATCHING YOUR BROTHERS FISH. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY HE IS HERE, CAPTAIN RON. ZIP. Narrator: COMING UP, PHIL'S BLOOD BOILS OVER. I AM IN SERIOUS, DEEP [BLEEP] HERE, NORM. PHIL, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS -- FIX THE [BLEEP] THING. Narrator: BACK IN DUTCH HARBOR, AFTER STEAMING 36 HOURS ON ONE ENGINE, THE CORNELIA MARIE HAS FINALLY MADE IT TO PORT. HEY, THIS IS PHIL ON THE CORNELIA. IS YOUR CABLE SHOP OPEN TODAY? Narrator: FOR CAPTAIN PHIL, HOPES OF A SMOOTH SEASON ARE QUICKLY FADING. WITH THE DELIVERY DEADLINE A WEEK AWAY, HE'LL HAVE TO RACE TO GET BOTH HIS ENGINE AND HIS ANCHOR LINE FIXED. Phil: TODAY'S A SPEND-SOME-MONEY, SMOKE-SOME-CIGARETTES, DRINK-LOTS-OF-CAFFEINE DAY TODAY. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. WHAT ARE WE DOING, NORM? I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE NO CLUE. IT'S NOT LEAKING OUTSIDE. I AM IN SERIOUS, DEEP [BLEEP] HERE, NORM. PHIL, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FOR THIS, THE SHIMS THAT ARE GONNA GO UNDERNEATH IT, YOU GOT TO PULL THE HEAD. JUST FIX THE [BLEEP] THING. I SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS NOT TO BE IN THIS POSITION, AND HERE I AM IN THIS POSITION. HARD STUFF TO COIL. WE'RE DOING GOOD. GO, GO, GO, GO. GO, GO, GO, GO. Man: YOU CAN DO IT. Narrator: WHILE THE CREW WORKS ON THE ANCHOR CABLE... DOWN BELOW, PHIL AND DUTCH HARBOR BOAT MECHANIC NORM NEWELL ASSESS THE DAMAGE. PUTTING THE NEW CABLE ON RIGHT NOW. Narrator: AFTER THREE HOURS OF TINKERING WITH THE ANCHOR LINE, THE CREW FINISHES. NOW IT'S HURRY UP AND WAIT. Millman: ALL THE MONEY THAT WE SPENT ON THOSE ENGINES, WE COULD HAVE BOUGHT TWO BRAND-NEW ENGINES A COUPLE OF TIMES BY NOW. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A NEVER-ENDING MONEY PIT, THOSE THINGS. Phil: THAT'S THE PROBLEM. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG UNTIL YOU GET INTO THAT ENGINE AND TEAR IT APART. YOU KNOW, IT'S A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS OUT OF MY POCKET EVERY TIME WE GOT TO RUN TO DUTCH AND BACK TO THE GROUNDS. Phil: IT'S GOT TO BE AN O-RING OR A LINER, CORRECT? EITHER OR, YEAH. EITHER OR. AND IT WAS A NUMBER SIX. IT WAS -- OKAY. SO THEN WE START DOWN THE LIST. YOU FIND THAT [BLEEP] DO WE HAVE TO SHIM IT? THAT WOULD BE THE CORRECT WAY TO DO IT. YES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THEN I'M SPENDING LABOR AND HAVING YOU THREE WEEKS LATER OR TWO MONTHS LATER DO THE SAME [BLEEP] THING. OKAY, SO WE PUT THIS BACK TOGETHER, YOU GO OUT, YOU FINISH YOUR SEASON. WHEN YOU'RE DONE, WE DO IT RIGHT. Narrator: WITHOUT A CLEAR PROGNOSIS OF THE ENGINE FAILURE, PHIL'S LEFT WITH TWO OPTIONS -- A $50,000 ENGINE OVERHAUL, FORCING THE CORNELIA MARIE TO MISS A CRUCIAL DEADLINE, OR GAMBLE THE ENTIRE SEASON FISHING ON JUST ONE ENGINE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I DO? I CAN'T -- I CAN'T STAY HERE. I CAN'T AFFORD TO FOOL AROUND, YOU KNOW? 305 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE WIZARD IS FINALLY BACK ON HER FISHING GROUNDS. AWFUL LOT OF HEADACHES AND AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK TO GET THAT GEAR OUT HERE AND GET IT IN THE WATER THIS YEAR, A LOT MORE STRESS THAN I LIKE TO GO THROUGH TO OPEN A SEASON. Narrator: AFTER BATTLING BIG WEATHER AND A QUICK TRIP TO DUTCH HARBOR TO REPAIR HIS HYDRAULIC SYSTEM... NEGATIVE! NEGATIVE. COME ON, CRAB. NEED SOME CRAB. NEED SOME CRAB. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN KEITH PREPARES TO PULL HIS FIRST POTS. Keith: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S THE COLOR I'M LOOKING FOR. COME ON. BE KEEPERS. OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH. COME ON. BE BIG. Man: OH, LOOK AT THAT! THAT IS GOOD! EH, MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF DIRTY STUFF IN THERE. I'M NOT GONNA -- I'M NOT GONNA CELEBRATE YET. I GOT TO WAIT AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUALITY IN THAT POT. Monte: GOT TO HIT THAT WEB! PRETTY GOOD, BUT THERE'S SOME BARNACLES ON THESE, SOME SMALL GROWTH HERE -- WE REALLY DON'T WANT THAT. WHAT DID WE GET? IT'S 300 -- ABOUT 300. [BLEEP] THAT. 300 IS ALL. TOO MUCH GARBAGE IN IT. Narrator: BY MOST STANDARDS, 300 OPIES IS A GOOD POT. BUT FOR KEITH, IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO HAUL GEAR ON THAT KIND OF SORTING. Monte: THAT HURTS! Narrator: LOW CRAB BREEDS LOW MORALE. AND FOR GREENHORN MOI, IT'S JUST ANOTHER EXCUSE TO START SLACKING. NO, IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE MOI KIND OF STEP UP AND DO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE CLIMBING IN THE POT. NOBODY LIKES TO CLIMB IN THE POT. YOU GOT OLD, STINKY BAIT HANGING ON YOU. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SITTING THERE LIFTING THOSE BAIT-BAG SETUPS UP ABOVE YOUR HEAD LIKE THAT. I MEAN, IT'S HARD WORK. YOU KNOW, AND THE KID'S DOING IT. HE'S GOING INTO EVERY SINGLE POT. Narrator: TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, HOLES IN THE POTS ARE LEADING TO EVEN LOWER NUMBERS. LeVeen: ALL RIGHT. Keith: YOU KNOW WHAT? RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T NEED TO BE REPAIRING GEAR AS WE'RE HAULING IT. THAT GEAR NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TOWN BEFORE WE SET SAIL, AND THAT IS REALLY CHAFING MY ASS. Narrator: TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THE POTS CLEARING THE RAIL CONTINUE TO BE RIDDLED WITH MORE HOLES AND OPEN DOORS. Monte: THAT MEAN THERE'S A HOLE? Soper: SOMEWHERE. WELL, WHY DIDN'T THEY FIX IT? YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH A WHOLE [BLEEP] BOATLOAD OF THAT [BLEEP] WE'RE GONNA BE [BLEEP] SORRY. Keith: I MEAN, I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CATCHING CRAB, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TWICE AS FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW OVER THE FACT THAT FIVE OF THESE FIRST POTS HAVE EITHER TWINE, A TUNNEL STRAP, A BROKEN TUNNEL. I'VE DONE SOMETHING TO JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THESE POTS. NOW I'M OUT HERE UNDER THE GUN TRYING TO HAUL GEAR TO GET THIS BOAT FULL IN FIVE DAYS, AND WE'RE RIGGING GEAR ON THE FIRST SET? THIS IS A JOKE. IT'S BUILDING. IT'S BUILDING. THERE HAVE BEEN LIKE FOUR SIZEABLE MISTAKES IN LIKE FOUR POTS. YOU KNOW, I'M TIRED OF PLAYING HAPPY-GO-LUCKY. [BLEEP] LENNY JUST SAID MY BROTHER'S THE GREATEST [BLEEP] GUY IN THE WORLD. THESE GUYS ARE ALL PIECES OF [BLEEP] IT'S KIND OF FRUSTRATING TO SEE US FIXING THE GEAR AT THIS POINT. WE JUST GOT STARTED. THESE SHOULD BE ALL READY AND TIGHT, GOOD TO GO, AND A COUPLE OF THEM HAVEN'T BEEN. YOU DON'T OPEN AN OPIE SEASON WHEN YOU'RE COMING OUT HERE INTO HELLACIOUS WEATHER, FREEZING SPRAY, ICING, AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITHOUT THE GEAR DIALED IN 100%. I'M JUST -- I -- IT'S JUST LIKE THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK. ONE MORE [BLEEP] UP AND YOU GET A FREAK-OUT. Narrator: COMING UP, A BERING SEA LASHING. Keith: EVERYTHING I HAVE SEEN SO FAR IS A "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN" CREW FISHING ON A "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN" BOAT. Narrator: 305 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE WIZARD CREW HAS SPENT THE LAST 8 HOURS HAULING LOW NUMBERS. NASTINESS IN HERE! THE POTS ARE RIDDLED WITH HOLES AND LOOSE DOORS. GOT A LITTLE OPIE HIGHWAY HAPPENING. WITH EACH POT NEEDING MORE REPAIR WORK, CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN IS PUSHED A FEW DEGREES CLOSER TO BOILING OVER. [ SIGHS ] MAYBE I'M JUST GOING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OF MY PSYCHOSIS, BUT I DON'T THINK SO. I NEED THESE GUYS TO STEP UP A NOTCH. I NEED THESE GUYS TO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS BOAT'S ALWAYS HAD A MYSTIQUE TO IT, AND EVERYTHING I'VE DONE IN THE LAST 20 YEARS HAS TRIED TO MAKE THAT EVEN GROW. I JUST -- I FEEL LIKE THESE GUYS JUST AREN'T PUTTING OUT THE EFFORT, MAN. HEY, STACK IT UP. THEN I WANT EVERYBODY  IN THE GEAR ROOM. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] HEY, YOU GUYS. FIRST OFF, CAN EVERYBODY SEE ME? EVERYBODY, I WANT SOME EYES HERE LOOKING AT ME. FOR 20 YEARS, I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN TO BUILD THE REPUTATION OF THIS BOAT, AND THAT GOES EVERY SINGLE SEASON, EVERY SINGLE WEEK, EVERY SINGLE DAY, DOWN TO EVERY SINGLE LAST POT. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I HAVE SEEN SO FAR IS A "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN" CREW FISHING ON A "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN" BOAT. I HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE IN WHAT I DO. I HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE IN MY BOAT. I EXPECT MY CREW TO HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE IN THIS BOAT, AS WELL. [BLEEP] WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SAID LET'S [BLEEP] LENNY, I -- DON'T GET ME WORKED UP, OKAY? I DON'T WANT TO LET ANYBODY DOWN. WELL, RIGHT NOW I FEEL THE ENTIRE CREW HAS BEEN LETTING ME AND THE BOAT DOWN. AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT, LENNY. IT'S THE WHOLE BOAT. MOI, QUIT RIDING ON THE KID'S TAILS, ALL RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN MAKING HIM CRAWL IN EVERY SINGLE POT. YOU KNOW WHAT? AND WE'VE ONLY HAULED 45 POTS. GARY, I KNOW YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL BY YOURSELF. YOU GOT TO BE MORE AUTHORITATIVE, ALL RIGHT? JUMP DOWN THESE GUYS' THROATS ONCE IN A WHILE. IF HE TELLS YOU SOMETHING, I EXPECT YOU GUYS TO [BLEEP] DO IT. LET'S GO BACK OUT. LITTLE PEP TALK, LITTLE RALLY CALL, AND WE'RE ON IT. PUT A LITTLE FIRE IN OUR ASS. Keith: WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED THE SEASON, AND I GOT TO TRY AND CONVINCE THESE GUYS THAT THERE'S MORE TO THIS THAN JUST THROWING A BUNCH OF POTS ONBOARD AND COMING OUT HERE AND HAULING GEAR AND FILLING THE BOAT FOR FREE. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. Narrator: 45 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST, THE NORTHWESTERN CREW HAVE BEEN WORKING 24 HOURS WITHOUT A BREAK. AND AS FAR AS EDGAR KNOWS, THERE'S NO PLAN TO STOP. WE'RE ON A 600 AVERAGE. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S A THING OF BEAUTY. YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS THERE'S CRAB IN THE POT, WHETHER IT'S NIGHT OR DAY, WHENEVER YOU HAUL IT, YOU KNOW -- WE CAN BE VAMPIRES AND FISH AT NIGHT. I DON'T CARE. I JUST WANT TO PUT THE CRAB ON MY BOAT. Narrator: FOR THE LAST 20 HOURS, SIG'S AVERAGED OVER 675 KEEPERS A POT, JUST SHY A FEW THOUSAND POUNDS FROM STUFFING HIS FRONT TANK. NOW THEY HAVE 30 POTS TO GO BEFORE THEY'RE THROUGH THE GEAR. I'M TIRED. TIRED. Edgar: THERE. THERE YOU GO. THERE WE GO. WELL, IT'S COMING UP ON MIDNIGHT, SO WE'VE BEEN HAULING FOR 24 HOURS. WE WERE UP FOR QUITE A FEW HOURS PRIOR TO EVEN STARTING. SO WE'VE PUT IN A LITTLE TIME. I'M STARTING TO GET THE OPIE STARE HERE. Edgar: OH! WHOA, DUDE! [ Laughing ] MAN DOWN. Narrator: 43-YEAR-OLD DECKHAND NICK MAVAR SLIPS, BUT EDGAR COULDN'T CARE LESS. WATCH OUT FOR ALL THEM BANANA PEELS. GOING ON 20 HOURS NOW -- GETTING A LITTLE TIRED? IT'S SLIPPERY! FIVE ADVIL COMING ON. HE'S OLD, AND HE'S TIRED. HE FELL. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Mavar: THE LAST POT... OF A 30-HOUR DAY. Narrator: IN JUST ONE DAY, SIG'S MANAGED TO CATCH NEARLY $95,000 OF OPILIO GOLD -- NOT BAD FOR A BLIND SET. PROBABLY PUT 70 -- OVER 70,000 IN THERE. I KNOW. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S A LOT OF CRAB. A LITTLE LUCK, A LOT OF HARD WORK... AND THE NEED FOR NOT SLEEPING. SO, WAS THAT OUR PEP TALK, OR -- WHAT WAS THAT? Narrator: THE CRAB COUNT -- WITH A LUCKY SET, THE  NORTHWESTERN TIES FOR THE LEAD. Narrator: 345 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT HAS LEFT CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN'S GROUNDS AND IS GEARING UP TO HAUL POTS IN THE AREA KNOWN TO CRABBERS AS MR. MAGOO. Andy: I'M ON MY OLD STOMPING GROUNDS -- MR. MAGOO. THIS IS OUR SPOT, THE HILLSTRAND MAGOO SPOT. YOU EVER SEE MR. MAGOO? HE'S BLIND. Man: YEAH. SEE HIS CHIN? NOW THINK OF HIM WITH HIS HAT ON RIGHT HERE. YEAH. LITTLE FOREHEAD, NOSE... THERE'S MR. MAGOO. MOUTH AND CHIN -- THAT'S CALLED MAGOO. MAGOO'S BEEN GOOD TO US, VERY GOOD TO US. Long: IT'S GONNA BE VERY COLD. I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH COLD, TEMPERATURE-WISE, BUT THE WIND IS BLOWING, I GUESS, JUST SIDEWAYS. THE WEATHER HAS PICKED UP OUT HERE. NOT AN ASS-KICKER LIKE IT WAS TWO NIGHTS AGO, BUT WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF CHOPPY WEATHER. IT'S GONNA KEEP CAPTAIN ANDY ON HIS TOES TONIGHT. Narrator: AFTER JOHNATHAN'S HOT SPOT PROVED TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A COLD DESERT, CAPTAIN ANDY TOOK 50 POTS AND SPLASHED THEM ON MR. MAGOO. NOW, AFTER SOAKING FOR 12 HOURS, ANDY'S NOT THE ONLY HILLSTRAND WAITING FOR THE RESULTS. WE HAVE TO FIND OUT. WE HAVE TO FIND OUT. IF THIS PAYS OFF FOR ANDY, MORE THAN BRAGGING RIGHTS, HE'LL HAVE THE CHANCE TO FINALLY THROW A MUZZLE ON HIS BACKSEAT DRIVER. OH, YEAH. [ CHEERING ] COME ON, BABY. OH, YEAH! YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHS ] THAT IS GOING DOWN. I'D SAY WE JUST FOUND OUR CRAB. OH, LOOK AT THAT ONE. [ LAUGHS ] Man: WHERE DOES A GUY START? Man #2: AT THE BOTTOM. PULLED MY FIRST POT. IT IS HALF FULL. [ LAUGHS ] YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH? [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, BABY! THAT'S EVEN BETTER! [ LAUGHTER ] WE GOT LOTS OF CRAB. YEAH, BROTHER! SO FAR, ALL OF OUR POTS THAT WE'VE DUMPED UP HERE UP NORTH HAVE BEEN HALF FULL, EVERY POT. Man: SO FAT, IT'S SICK. YEAH. LOOK AT THAT. YEAH, THIS BIG MOVE JUST TOTALLY PAID OFF FOR US. Narrator: AS ANDY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE THE BIG NUMBERS, OLDER BROTHER JOHNATHAN DECIDES BEING RIGHT ISN'T AS IMPORTANT AS BEING RICH. WE'RE GONNA COME BACK OUT. I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE A WAY QUICKER TRIP NEXT TRIP. A SLAM [BLEEP] DUNK NEXT TIME. HERE ONE TIME AND HAVE 120,000 POUNDS HAVE TO GO IN. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR. Narrator: 100 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST, ON THE WIZARD, THE CREW RETURNS TO FISHING AFTER CAPTAIN KEITH'S PEP TALK. SO, I GUESS WE'RE [BLEEP] LOSERS. I DON'T KNOW. JUST KEEP GOING, KEEP DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING. PICK IT UP A NOTCH OR TWO, I GUESS, AND SEE IF THAT PLEASES HIM. Keith: WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WORKS HARD IN THE BERING SEA. TO SOME OF THE GUYS, MAYBE I INSULTED THEM. YOU KNOW, LIKE, IN THAT SITUATION, LENNY TOOK IT PERSONAL RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S THE KIND OF GUY THAT'S PRETTY PROUD OF WHAT HE DOES, AND HE DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK I RUBBED HIM THE WRONG WAY, YOU KNOW? HEY, HAVE LENNY SHOOT UP HERE. OKAY. JUST DO ME ONE FAVOR, OKAY? IF I EVER GO INTO ONE OF MY TIRADES... I'M SORRY. ...IF I EVER GO INTO ONE OF MY SPEECHES, NO MATTER WHAT... YES. ...BEAR WITH ME AND DON'T -- DON'T SAY ANYTHING. ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY. ALL RIGHT? BECAUSE I AM AN EMOTIONAL GUY, AND I TEND TO SNAP REALLY, REALLY QUICKLY. NO. YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT. Keith: SO, ANYWAYS, LENNY, TAKE MY APOLOGY. I'M SORRY I SNAPPED. THAT'S THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO. RIGHT ON. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: THERE MAY BE PEACE WITH LENNY, BUT DOWN IN THE GALLEY, GREENHORN MOI'S BEEN STEWING, AND HE'S NOT ABOUT TO LET THE CAPTAIN HAVE THE LAST WORD. WHAT DO YOU WANT, MOI? WELL, I WANT TO START OUT WITH I'M NOT RIDING ANYBODY'S FREAKING COATTAILS. [BLEEP] I BAITED THE FIRST 230 POTS. MOI, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT NOW. GET OUT OF MY [BLEEP] WHEELHOUSE NOW! I DON'T NEED TO HEAR A [BLEEP] WHINY LITTLE GREENHORN IN MY [BLEEP] WHEELHOUSE RIGHT NOW. SO JUST CAN IT. ENJOY YOUR DOWNTIME. THAT GUY HAS NO [BLEEP] BRAIN. WHAT AN IDIOT -- "A," YOU DON'T DO THAT, "B," PARTICULARLY WHEN THE SKIPPER'S UPSET WITH ANYONE. AH, IT'S JUST NOT SMART. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTE [BLEEP] THAT HE PEELS ME OUT WHEN THERE WAS A STACK OF 200 FREAKING POTS IN FRONT OF HIM AND COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON ON THE DECK. Narrator: MOI BREAKS THE GOLDEN RULE OF ANY CRAB-FISHING BOAT -- NEVER QUESTION THE CAPTAIN. I JUST -- I'M AT A LOSS THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT, PROBABLY THE ONE GUY THAT REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR THAT TALK JUST NOW DIDN'T HEAR A SINGLE WORD. Narrator: WITH THE BERING SEA POUNDING ON HIS MEN AND HIS NERVES, CAPTAIN KEITH MAKES A CALL HOME, HOPING A CHAT WITH HIS 11-YEAR-OLD SON... LET ME TALK TO CAELIN AND GET THE WEATHER. ...WILL PUT HIM IN BETTER SPIRITS. CAELIN: Bear with me. Okay, gale warning Tuesday night around 8:45. YEAH, MAKING MY DAY, KID. This one sucks. Gale warning Wednesday... [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] ...heavy freezing spray. Bye, Dad. I love you. And may the best luck be with you, because you probably need it right now.
