 NO, I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] ASK ANYBODY ANYTHING! ...RAGED THROUGH THEIR BREAKING POINTS. NOW WITH JUST 72 HOURS LEFT, THE HUNT CONTINUES FOR THE DEADLIEST CATCH. [ MID-TEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ] WITH THE END IN SIGHT, EXHAUSTED GREENHORNS HAVE JUST THREE DAYS TO PROVE THEMSELVES AND LOCK IN THEIR BERTHS FOR THE UPCOMING OPILIO CRAB SEASON. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING A GREENHORN. SEE, HE'S KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT, JUST LIKE HE SHOULD. MY BIG GOAL RIGHT NOW IS TO BE INVITED BACK TO COME BACK AND FISH OPIES. I'LL FIGHT THROUGH THE BATTLE AND FINISH THE JOB. AND THEN WE'LL HEAD FOR HOME WHEN THE TIME'S RIGHT. Anderson: OH, I AM JUST RUNNING ON EMPTY. GIVING THEM ALL I GOT. IT'S ALMOST TIME TO GO HOME. Narrator: BUT THE GREENHORN GRIND PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE BATTLE THAT REMAINS FOR THE CAPTAINS. I CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THESE POTS. Narrator: THE KING CRAB HAVE BEEN ELUSIVE THIS YEAR, DRAGGING OUT EACH BOAT'S TIME AT SEA. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS. I REALLY DON'T. THERE'S NO CRAB IN THIS STRING. DON'T SEE HOW I CAN BLOW THIS THIS BAD. Narrator: THE BATTLE-TORN SKIPPERS ARE A FAR CRY FROM THE BOLD GANG THAT ASSEMBLED IN DUTCH HARBOR BEFORE THE START OF THE SEASON. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, HOW ABOUT SIPPING A DRINK? BACK THEN, GLORY WAS ABOUT BESTING THE MAN SITTING NEXT TO THEM. ALL RIGHT, IS THAT THE BET, THEN? WE CALL IT BEFORE WE HAUL IT? THEY WAGERED 100 BUCKS APIECE TO SEE WHO COULD PULL THE MOST CRAB IN A STRING OF POTS. Man: FOR OPIES, WE'LL SETTLE UP. RIGHT BEFORE WE GO OUT FOR OPIES, WE'LL SETTLE UP. Johnathan: RIGHT BEFORE OPIES, LET'S SETTLE UP. EACH WEEK, THE SKIPPERS DESIGNATED A 25-POT CAPTAIN'S STRING. MAYBE I'LL MAKE ONE OF THESE THE STRING OF THE WEEK. Narrator: THE CAPTAIN'S STRING PULLING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CRAB PER POT WOULD BE THAT WEEK'S WINNER. Johnathan: THIS IS MY SKIPPER STRING NO MATTER WHAT. THIS IS THE ONE WE PICKED. AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE THE BEST CRAB I'VE SEEN. YEAH! I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR STRING OF THE WEEK. I WANT TO GET THESE ON, PLAY THE GAME. Narrator: BUT IN THEIR EIGHTH WEEK, MOST OF THE SKIPPERS HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE COMPETITION DUE TO SLOW, UNEVEN FISHING. [ LAUGHS ] RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND A STRING TO SURVIVE ON. I THINK WE'RE OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR STRING OF THE WEEK. OH, NO! MAYBE WEAK STRING OF THE WEEK. Narrator: ONLY TWO BOATS HAVE FOUGHT ON TO CONTEND FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS AND HIGHLINER STATUS... WOW. 74. 74, BABY! ...THE WIZARD... LET'S SEE IT, SOPER. HE'S PRETTY HAPPY. 1-0-3. WHOO-HOO! Narrator: ...AND THE TIME BANDIT. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: BACK IN DUTCH HARBOR AFTER A QUICK OFF-LOAD, TIME BANDIT CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND HEADS TO THE AIRPORT TO PICK UP A REPLACEMENT HAND, HIS SON SCOTT. MY SON WENT HOME. HIS WIFE WAS BITCHING HE'S GONE. SHE WAS GONNA LEAVE HIM. HE WENT HOME. Narrator: LESS THAN A MONTH AGO, SCOTT TOLD HIS DAD HE WAS DONE WITH FISHING. IT WAS HOME AND HIS OWN SON THAT NEEDED MORE ATTENTION. Scott: I'M TRYING TO DO THE BEST THING I CAN. I'M TRYING TO BE A [BLEEP] DAD. DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. LOVE YOU, MAN. Narrator: BUT WHEN JOHNATHAN'S BROTHER ANDY HAD TO LEAVE THE BOAT TO ATTEND TO FAMILY BUSINESS, SCOTT DECIDED TO HELP THE OLD MAN OUT AND FLEW BACK TO DUTCH FOR A SECOND TIME THIS SEASON. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HIM AGAIN. LET'S GO GET HIM. [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT, YOU MADE IT, MAN. WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY? GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. WE NEED YOU, MAN. GLAD TO BE HERE. REAL GOOD. GLAD TO BE HERE. Narrator: NOW REUNITED WITH HIS SON, JOHNATHAN HEADS TOWARDS THE CRAB GROUNDS. SCOTT JOINS HIS DAD FOR HIS FINAL CAPTAIN'S STRING THAT'S BEEN SOAKING FOR 48 HOURS. IT'S A STRING THAT COULD DETERMINE THE WINNER FOR THE SEASON. [ CHEERING ] YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: COMING UP... A POT-FOR-POT SLUGFEST. 135! 148! THE ROUT IS ON. Narrator: 265 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND ON THE TIME BANDIT AND KEITH COLBURN ON THE WIZARD APPROACH THEIR FINAL CAPTAIN'S STRINGS. WITH HIS SON'S CHANGE OF HEART AND POTS SET ON RICH GROUNDS, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN IS IN HIGH SPIRITS. Johnathan: WHEN A KID WILL STAND UP, YOU KNOW, JUST COME FLYING OUT, DROP EVERYTHING, TELL HIS WIFE, "HEY, I GOT TO GO" -- BUT HE CAME RIGHT OUT, SO THAT'S HUGE RIGHT THERE, FOR ME AND ANDY AND NEAL, ALL OF US, TO SEE THAT HE'LL FLY THE [BLEEP] RIGHT OUT IF WE NEED HIM AND TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. IT WAS PRETTY NICE. THE LAST TIME I HAD HIM OUT ON THE BOAT, WE GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP, DID A LOT OF TALKING. IT'S ALL PRETTY GOOD -- PRETTY COOL SEEING MY KID. HE'S A GOOD GUY TO HANG OUT WITH. HE'S CLEAN, HE WORKS HARD, NO [BLEEP] GUY -- JUST A GOOD GUY TO HANG OUT WITH. Scott: IT'S SOMETHING THAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO. NOT ONLY DO I HAVE MY DAD, BUT I HAVE TWO OTHER UNCLES. THEY'VE ALL BEEN KIND OF FATHER FIGURES TO ME. THAT I CAN SHARE THIS WITH MY SON, MAN, IS JUST PHENOMENAL. [ Imitating pirate ] BRING ME THE BROWN PANTS! [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: NOW, AFTER WEEKS DIALING INTO THE CRAB GROUNDS, JOHNATHAN PULLS UP TO THE FIRST POT OF HIS CAPTAIN'S STRING. THE PIRATE WAY -- TAKE 'EM ALL FOR OURSELVES AND LEAVE NOTHING FOR NOBODY. [ Normal voice ] COMING OUT. I'M COMING OUT. THAT'S GOOD! WHOO-HOO! YEAH, BABY! WHOO! YEAH, BABY! YEAH, BABY! [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: 86 CRAB -- IT'S A KILLER START. AND IT'S 26 CRAB HIGHER THAN HIS SEASONAL CAPTAIN'S-STRING AVERAGE OF 60 KEEPERS PER POT. IF JOHNATHAN'S NUMBERS KEEP UP, HE'LL GAIN A GOOD LEAD ON HIS RIVAL. BUT 80 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST,  WIZARD CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN IS BITING AT THE HEELS OF THE TIME BANDIT. Keith: RIGHT ON.  POT'S IN THE BLOCK. RIGHT ON, GUYS. CAPTAIN'S STRING. Man: WHOO-HOO-HOO! THAT'S A SERIOUS POT OF CRAB THERE. YEAH! LET'S GO HIGH! THEY WON'T EVEN COME OUT! HERE COMES SOPER'S COUNT. LET'S SEE IT, SOPER. HE'S PRETTY HAPPY. 1-0-3. [ LAUGHS ] WHOO-HOO! 103. YES, THE ROUT IS ON. Narrator: A DUEL TO THE FINISH BEGINS. ISN'T THAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING YOU'VE EVER FREAKIN' SEEN IN YOUR WHOLE DAMN LIFE? [ LAUGHS ] 117. SO, WE GOT THEM! [ LAUGHS ] WHOO! [ LAUGHS ] WHAT?! 135! WOW. 135 KEEPERS IN THAT POT. Narrator: THE BOATS ARE IN A CRAB-FOR-CRAB STREET FIGHT. AT THIS RATE, IT MAY COME DOWN TO THE LAST POT. [ BIRDS CAWING ] 180 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN'S NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT THROUGH THIS KING CRAB SEASON... ...CONSISTENTLY MEDIOCRE. THIS LAST STRING THAT I'M ON DIDN'T REALLY PRODUCE AS MUCH. MIGHT AS WELL JUST GRIND IT OUT TO THE BITTER END, YOU KNOW, GET HER FULL AND GO IN KNOWING THAT YOU DID YOUR BEST. IT'S CRAZY. IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS. Narrator: NOW DOWN TO WHAT HE HOPES WILL BE HIS LAST STRING, THE NORWEGIAN HEAVY HITTER IS JUST LOOKING FOR A SOLID BASE HIT TO END A LACKLUSTER SEASON. YOU KNOW, IF WE HAD A 30-PLUS AVERAGE, I THINK WE'D GET IT FAIRLY EASILY. BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S GONNA BE KIND OF NIP-AND-TUCK TO THE END. WE'RE REAL CLOSE TO BEING FULL RIGHT NOW. LET'S JUST SEE IF WE CAN'T GET THOSE TANKS COMPLETELY FULL. Narrator: SIG'S CREW HAS BEEN GRINDING 20 HOURS A DAY FOR THE LAST WEEK, HOPING THAT THIS NEXT STRING WILL BE THEIR LAST. LONG DAY. WHAT TIME DID WE GET UP? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TIME WE GOT UP. 8:00 MAYBE? WHAT? 8:00? IT WAS LIKE 4:00 OR 5:00. YOU MIGHT AS WELL SIGN YOURSELF UP FOR A PRISON SENTENCE. Sig: WE'VE BEEN GOING AT IT. IT'S TIME TO GO HOME. IT REALLY IS TIME FOR THESE GUYS TO GO HOME. THEY'VE EARNED THEIR TICKET HOME BIG-TIME. Narrator: THE UNDERSTATED YET NEVERTHELESS APPRECIATIVE SKIPPER DOES SOME FIGURING. AND THE NUMBERS ARE ADDING UP TO GOOD NEWS FOR HIS WEARY CREW. SO I'LL PULL A COUPLE MORE HERE, AND THEN I THINK THAT'LL BE IT. Narrator: JUST TWO MORE POTS, AND THE NORTHWESTERN'S KING CRAB GRIND WILL MERCIFULLY COME TO AN END. WHOA! AAH! [BLEEP] WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS THAT?! THE BOAT ROLLS JUST AS JAKE GRABS FOR THE 12-POUND PICKING HOOK. JAKE MISSES, AND THE HOOK... SLAMS INTO EDGAR'S HEAD LIKE A SLEDGEHAMMER. WHOA! WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS THAT?! Sig: IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR EVERYDAY GRIND, AND SOMETHING WILL POP UP AND BITE YOU LIKE A PICKING HOOK, YOU KNOW? IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION. IT'S NOT BLEEDING, IS IT? Man: OW! WHAT "OW"? WHY IS EVERYBODY SAYING "OW"? OH, MY GOD! Anderson: JUST MUST HAVE HIT THE WRONG ROLL AND [BLEEP] SWUNG RIGHT IN HIS [BLEEP] HEAD. THE BOAT ROLLED THIS WAY, THE PICKING HOOK CAME OUT OF THE BRIDLE, AND BAM! WHOA! AAH! [BLEEP] WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS THAT?! OW. MY TEETH ARE STILL RINGING. I JUST DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN HURT MY BRO LIKE THAT. THIS IS THE SOUND IT MADE IN MY HEAD. [ CLANG ] THIS IS MY LOVE FOR YOU. I'M HAVING A HARDER TIME WITH THIS -- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT -- JUST A LITTLE BATTLE SCAR. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN HIT IN THE HEAD, BELIEVE ME. WHOOSH! BAM! ONE MORE? IS THAT IT? Narrator: WITH ONE POT LEFT, EDGAR WILL IGNORE THE POUNDING IN HIS HEAD AND THE CONCUSSION THAT MOST LIKELY GOES ALONG WITH IT LONG ENOUGH TO TOSS OUT THE TRADITIONAL SEASON-ENDING FLAMING HOOK. IT'S THE FINALE OF OUR SEASON, SO WE GOT TO DO THE FLAMING HOOK. YEAH! [ CHEERING ] Narrator: SIG'S CALCULATIONS ARE RIGHT ON THE MONEY. ALL RIGHT. BOOM, YOU'RE DONE! [ CHEERING ] YEAH, DUDE! YEAH! Narrator: NO HONEY HOLES AND NO MOTHER LODE THIS SEASON -- THEY DID IT THE HARD WAY, A LITTLE AT A TIME. BUT ONCE AGAIN, THE NORTHWESTERN HEADS FOR THE FINAL OFF-LOAD WITH FULL TANKS OF ALASKAN KING CRAB. Narrator: THE NORTH AMERICAN IS STILL 11,000 POUNDS SHORT OF A FULL CRAB TANK. OH, YEAH. FOR CAPTAIN STEN SKAAR, TIME IS RUNNING OUT FAST. Sten: WELL, ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW, ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. NEVER SAY NEVER, YOU KNOW? TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS, YOU GOT TO BE AN OPTIMIST, NOT A PESSIMIST. Narrator: THEY STARTED OUT WITH JUST TWO WEEKS TO FISH. NOW THEY'RE DOWN TO THE LAST 24 HOURS. IF THEY DON'T PULL OFF A MIRACLE, THIS COULD BE THE LAST CRAB ROUNDUP FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN. WATCH OUT! Sten: THEY'RE SHOCKED. THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. NO ONE LIKES TO SEE SEVEN. THINK ABOUT IT. THERE WAS ONE CRAB IN THE FIRST POT. THE NEXT POT HAS SEVEN. Man: RIGHT. SO THAT'S SEVEN TIMES MORE. SO THE NEXT POT SHOULD BE 49. Sten: THIS NEXT POT IS THE TESTING ONE 'CAUSE I GOT ALL MY GEAR THERE. SO THAT WILL BE THE ONE TO TELL A LOT. Narrator: WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 25 POTS STACKED ON DECK, THE REMAINING GEAR IS STRUNG OUT ON THIS ONE PIECE OF REAL ESTATE. IT'S MAKE IT OR BREAK IT FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN. IT'S COMING UP. OH, WOW! WE GOT SOMETHING HERE. LOOK AT THAT! WOW! YES! RELIEF! Narrator: FINALLY, A POT WITH MORE CRAB THAN BAIT. 49! 4-9! 49. 49. BOOM, WE'RE BACK... FINALLY. I SAID IT WAS THE SECOND SET THAT WAS THE KEY, MAN. 4-9, 4-9, 4-9. WE'RE GONNA SET THE DECK. WE'RE GONNA SET THE DECK, MAN. THIS IS AWESOME. Narrator: CAPTAIN STEN TAKES WHAT MAY BE THE BIGGEST GAMBLE OF HIS CAREER AND CLEARS THE DECK OF HIS LAST 25 POTS. ALL RIGHT, MEN. WE'RE GONNA SET THE DECK. SET THE DECK. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE HAIL MARY. OH, YEAH. THIS IS ALL OR NOTHING RIGHT HERE. IT'S GETTING DOWN TO THE WIRE. AW, MAN, IF WE DON'T GET THIS, WE'RE SCREWED. Narrator: THE LAST 100 POTS WILL HAVE TO CATCH 11,000 POUNDS IN ORDER FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN TO MAKE THEIR DEADLINE. Sten: I'M RELIEVED. I'M ELATED. FEELING GOOD. FEELING GOOD. Man: WHOA! WHOA, BABY! TALK TO ME, BABY. WHO'S YOUR DADDY? Narrator: 45 MILES WEST, THE EARLY DAWN HAS SPENT ANOTHER DISMAL NIGHT HAULING LOW POTS. [BLEEP] OH [BLEEP] [BLEEP] 17. 1-7. WE GOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A SALAD TONIGHT, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT. ENOUGH TO [BLEEP] MAKE ME [BLEEP] SCREAM. Narrator: THEY'VE BEEN FISHING KING CRAB FOR SIX WEEKS, AND CAPTAIN RICK HAS STILL NOT DIALED IN TO STEADY NUMBERS. I JUST BROUGHT UP 24 POTS. THEY SUCKED BAD. Narrator: AND THE CREW HAS HAD ENOUGH. OUR SKIPPER AIN'T GOT NO LEGS, NO [BLEEP] I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO JUST PUTS UP WITH STUFF, YOU KNOW? I'LL WALK. I DON'T CARE. 5. THERE'S PROBABLY GONNA BE 6 IN THE NEXT ONE. THAT'S MY GUESS. WE NEED TO HEAD FURTHER TO THE EAST. WE NEED TO HEAD FURTHER SOMEWHERE. Narrator: BY HIGH NOON, THE CREW IS BACK AT THE RAIL, AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED. 9 CRAB! 9 CRAB! Narrator: ON A QUICK RUN BETWEEN STRINGS, BRYAN MAKES A PHONE CALL HOME. THE CREW LOSES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PAY, BUT IT'S A HIT THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE TO SPRING FROM THIS BERING SEA PRISON. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. I'M GONNA GO HUNT FOR ONE HERE. SO I'LL LET YOU KNOW. Narrator: THE BOAT OWNER CALLS RICK AND DELIVERS THE FINAL BLOW TO HIS SEASON. WELL, AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW -- I'M NOT GONNA COME UP WITH THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR YOU. I MEAN, WHERE'S ALL THIS COMING FROM? WELL, CAN I SAY ANYTHING AT ALL? ALL RIGHT, BYE. WELL, THE DEAL IS RIGHT NOW IS HE LEASED OUT 75,000 POUNDS OF THE REMAINDER OF OUR QUOTA BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT I'M INCAPABLE OF CATCHING THE CRAB BASED UPON SEVERAL PHONE CALLS THAT HE RECEIVED FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF MY CREW. [ LAUGHTER ] Mezich: IF YOU THINK RICK GETS PISSED OFF NOW... [ LAUGHS ] OH. I FEEL LIKE MY TRUST HAS BEEN COMPROMISED, YOU KNOW? I FEEL THAT MY WHOLE WAY I'VE RUN VESSELS ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY THIS. Narrator: COMING UP, THE MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR THE HAIL MARY. Narrator: ON THE FISHING GROUNDS 180 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT AND WIZARD CONTINUE TO GO CRAB FOR CRAB IN THEIR BATTLE FOR THE CAPTAIN'S STRING. ON THE WIZARD, CAPTAIN KEITH'S GREENHORNS HAVE FISHED THROUGH AN EXHAUSTING MARATHON. BUT THE GOOD CRAB HAVE GIVEN THEM BOTH A SECOND WIND. I'M DOING A LOT BETTER THAN I WAS A COUPLE DAYS AGO. IT'S ALL COMING AROUND. Narrator: AS THE WIZARD WAITS TO PULL THEIR NEXT POT OF THE STRING, THE TIME BANDIT PULLS A MASSIVE POT. YES! Narrator: NOT ONLY ARE HIS POTS PERFORMING, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN CAN SHARE THE ADRENALINE WITH HIS SON. POW! YEAH, BABY! Narrator: TO WIN, THE WIZARD WILL NEED TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST 150 CRAB IN THE LAST FEW POTS. OUCH. ALL RIGHT, IN THE LAUNCHER. Man: WE WERE LOOKING PRETTY HOT. HAD 130-SOMETHING CRAB IN A POT. IT WAS LOOKING GOOD. THAT POT CAME UP, AND I DON'T THINK THERE WERE ANY IN IT. [ IMITATES CRASH ] Narrator: KEITH'S NUMBERS HAVE BEEN UP AND DOWN. FINAL STRING OF THE TRIP WAS THE CAPTAIN'S STRING. WE HAD 1,563 CRAB... FOR A 62 AVERAGE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GONNA HOLD UP, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THAT AT ALL. Narrator: BUT OVER ON THE TIME BANDIT, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN IS AVERAGING MORE THAN 75 A POT. OH, YEAH. 148! WHOO! WHOO! ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE LAST ONE COMING UP, GUYS. YEAH! [ LAUGHTER ] Man: WE'RE TRYING TO SHOVE ALL THESE CRAB IN THE TANK, BUT IT'S GETTING HARDER BECAUSE WE'RE LOADED. Man: I HAD 76, AND YOU HAD 89. 90 AND 70. 165? 165. OH! [ LAUGHTER ] [ Chinese accent ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. Narrator: IN THE END, THE WIZARD'S STRING HAD A 62 AVERAGE AGAINST THE TIME BANDIT'S 75 AVERAGE, LEAVING THE TIME BANDIT IN THE LEAD AND THIS SEASON'S WINNER OF THE CAPTAIN'S STRING OF THE WEEK. THANK YOU, AND GOOD NIGHT! 100 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE TIME BANDIT, SKIPPER STEN SKAAR OF THE NORTH AMERICAN STEAMS TOWARDS HIS HAIL MARY POTS. NOW THE FATE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN'S KING CRAB SEASON RESTS SOLELY ON THIS STRING. TWO WEEKS AGO, STEN CONVINCED HIS FATHER, EARLING SKAAR, THAT HE COULD START THE SEASON LATE AND STILL CATCH THE FAMILY QUOTA. I JUST WANT A SHOT. AND I DESERVE A SHOT. SO, WE'LL SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE NUMBERS, THEN. YOU WANT NUMBERS? I'LL GET YOU NUMBERS. WE'RE HOPING FOR SOME BIG NUMBERS TODAY -- BIG, REAL BIG. I REALLY THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY GOOD DAY TODAY -- 1,500 MORE CRAB IN THE FRONT TANKS, START ON THE MIDDLE TANK. COME ON! COME ON, BABY! WHOO! I CAN FEEL IT! I CAN FEEL IT! WHO'S YOUR DADDY? WHO? WHO? WHO? ALL RIGHT! THERE IT IS! YES! WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO! 47. 4-7. WHOO! [ LAUGHTER ] THE POT LOOKS GOOD. OH, THAT'S A GOOD POT. AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED. 59. 5-9. LOOK IT HERE! WOW. UNBELIEVABLE. I MEAN, THEY'RE ALL 6 OR 7 POUNDS. IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET 100. NEVER HAD 100 BEFORE. Narrator: MIRACULOUSLY, STEN'S GAMBLE TO CARPET-BOMB AN AREA NEAR A SINGLE PROMISING TEST POT HAS PAID OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER? OH, MY GOD! PULL! THERE IT IS, BUDDY. WHOA. MY GOD. Narrator: BY LANDING ON THE HEAVY BIOMASS, STEN NOT ONLY SECURES HIS QUOTA BUT A BERTH ALONGSIDE FELLOW BERING SEA SKIPPERS FOR THE UPCOMING OPILIO SEASON. WOW. BIGGEST POT I'VE EVER SEEN...EVER. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. 147. GOT MY FIRST HUNDRED. UNBELIEVABLE. [ BIRDS CAWING ] Narrator: 190 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE CORNELIA MARIE IS BACK FISHING AND JUST ONE STRING AWAY FROM COMPLETING A HELLISH SEASON. Phil: THIS IS THE FINAL STRING WE HAVE WITH CRAB IN IT. THAT'S IT, THANK GOD. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE. IT'S TIME TO GO HOME. IT'S STARTING TO BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN I EXPECTED BY QUITE A FEW WEEKS. [ GRINDING ] Narrator: SUDDENLY, THE FITTING ON THE CRANE POPS, SPRAYING HYDRAULIC FLUID ALL OVER THE DECK... BRINGING EVERYTHING TO A HALT. Gamrath: WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS TRYING NOT TO LOSE THE HYDRAULIC FLUID. IF YOU HAVE A LEAK AND IT JUST CONTINUES TO LEAK, WELL, PRETTY SOON, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY HYDRAULIC FLUID ON THE BOAT. LIKE RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN AND STACK 100 ON. Narrator: WHILE THE CREW STANDS BY FOR SAFETY, MURRAY SLOWLY INCHES ACROSS THE OIL-SLICKED CRANE. WATCH AND MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T FALL OVER. Narrator: AS MURRAY PITCHES 30 FEET ABOVE THE DECK, A SNOW SQUALL PICKS UP. [ SIGHS ] YEAH, THIS ISN'T THE GREATEST CONDITIONS TO BE DOING THIS IN. OKAY, GO AHEAD AND TURN IT ON. [ MOTOR WHIRRING ] YOU CAN GO UP. OKAY, GO DOWN. YEAH, THE SEAL'S NOT LEAKING EITHER. WE'RE GOOD TO GO, BUDDY. WIND HER UP. WE'RE GOOD TO GO! MURRAY IS DEFINITELY A HERO ON THIS BOAT. THE GUY CAN FIX DANG NEAR ANYTHING. [ LAUGHS ] ALL'S YOU GOT TO GIVE HIM IS A COUPLE TOOTHPICKS, SUPERGLUE, AND DUCT TAPE. THE THING'S FASTER, BETTER, STRONGER -- THE BIONIC WINCH. LET'S GO HAUL SOME GEAR. Narrator: NOW WITH THE CRANE FIXED, THE CREW GETS BACK TO BUSINESS. Gamrath: WE ARE HAULING OUR LAST STRING OF THE SEASON RIGHT NOW... ...STACKING UP A LITTLE BIT. Man: READY TO ROCK! STOP. LAST POT OF THE SEASON. Phil:  OKAY, THANKS, GUYS. NICE JOB. IT'S BEEN A HELL OF A SEASON. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU EARNED YOUR MONEY? SURE. DO YOU? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT? BLOW IT. NO. YOU ARE, AREN'T YOU? THE SKY'S THE LIMIT. JUST PISS IT AWAY. AH, PISS IT AWAY -- IT'S A LOT MORE FUN. GO DELIVER, AND THEN WE GET TO GO HOME AND HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN IN THE SUN. MY ADVICE TO ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO DO THIS -- KIDS, YOU KNOW, STAY IN SCHOOL. LEARN TO BE SOMETHING. THIS'LL KILL YOU. THIS ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY. YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT TWISTED TO DO THIS JOB. Narrator: 155 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE CORNELIA MARIE, THE NORTHWESTERN STEERS TOWARDS THE PROCESSING PLANT ON AKUTAN ISLAND. STILL HALF ASLEEP, THE CREW HITS THE DECK FOR THE OFF-LOAD. JUST GOT ABOUT 20 HOURS OF SLEEP, WELL-DESERVED SLEEP. OH, BOY. IT'LL TAKE ME ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF TO WAKE UP NOW. IT'S JUST SORT OF SORE. WE GOT OUR LITTLE SLEEP, YOU KNOW? TAKE YOUR ASPIRIN. EVERY YEAR, IT GETS TOUGHER. [ WHIRRING ] I JUST WANT THEM ALL ALIVE, MAN. A LOT OF CRAB. THEY'RE BIG, TOO. THEY'RE HUGE. Narrator: THE STUFFED TANKS TAKE 26 HOURS TO UNLOAD. WITH ANOTHER SEASON IN THE BOOKS, THE CREW WATCHES OVER THE LAST BRAILER AND IS REMINDED OF THEIR HARD-FOUGHT BOUNTY. WHOA! AAH! [BLEEP] WHOA-HO-HO-HO-HO! COMING UP... PAIN, HEAVY WEATHER... EXHAUSTION... AND BROTHERHOOD... NORTHWESTERN!  NORTHWESTERN! YEAH! YEAH! SHOW SOME LOVE FOR YOUR BOAT. [ LAUGHS ] ...ALL FOR A NEW SEASON RECORD. HERE'S YOUR FISH TICKET. ALL RIGHT, MAN. IT'S OVER 190,000 POUNDS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT WAS THE MONEY WE FIGURED? OH, YOU GOT ABOUT 830 GRAND. $830,000. THAT'S ALMOST A MILLION-DOLLAR LOAD, MAN. Narrator: 30 MILES TO THE WEST OF AKUTAN, THE SUN RISES OVER THE WIZARD, STEAMING INTO DUTCH HARBOR FOR THEIR FINAL OFF-LOAD. WITH THE SEASON DONE, SKIPPER KEITH COLBURN AND BROTHER MONTE ASSESS THE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF THE CREW. Monte: WE HAVE TWO GREENHORNS ON THE BOAT. YOU COULD VERY EASILY CONSIDER THAT A MISTAKE IN ITSELF. TWO GUYS THAT HAVE NEVER FISHED BEFORE IS ASKING A LOT. BUT ALL IN ALL, THEY DID PRETTY GOOD. THEY BOTH HAD THEIR MOMENTS. MOI STRUGGLED. JASON! Moilanen: EVERY TIME, THEY GOT TO TRY SOMETHING [BLEEP] DIFFERENT JUST TO CONFUSE ME. MOI'S BEEN CRANKY. THE CAPTAIN SHOULD MAKE UP HIS [BLEEP] MIND ON HOW MUCH [BLEEP] BAIT HE WANTS. MOI HAS BEEN MOI. HUSTLE UP, KID! WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH IT? THE KID HAS BEEN SOLID AS A ROCK. I ENJOY BEING OUT HERE, YOU KNOW? AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED ON A BOAT, YOU KNOW? YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO JUST BE STEADY AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU'RE FISHING CRAB. Narrator: MOI'S FUTURE IS STILL UP IN THE AIR. BUT YOUNG LYNN EARNS A VISIT FROM THE CAPTAIN. HOW'D YOU LIKE YOUR FIRST KING CRAB TRIP? OH, IT WAS PRETTY -- PRETTY COOL. IT'S SOMETHING I'LL NEVER FORGET. WELL, GOOD JOB, KID. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. Woman: WHOO-HOO! COMING UP, A VICTORY CELEBRATION FOR THE TIME BANDIT BROTHERS. NOBODY'S EVER GONNA BEAT THAT 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO BUILD A BIGGER POT. Woman: YEAH. THE FINAL RED KING CRAB SEASON NUMBERS. Narrator: ANOTHER KING CRAB SEASON IS IN THE BOOKS. ALL 75 BOATS HAVE RETURNED SAFELY TO PORT WITH THEIR CREWS BATTERED AND BRUISED, BUT STILL ALIVE -- REASON TO CELEBRATE. Johnathan: NEAL, WE JUST WON THE CRAB BATTLE. I JUST FOUND OUT. NO ONE CAUGHT MORE CRAB PER POT THAN WE DID. AND IN THEIR HOMETOWN OF HOMER, ALASKA, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND IS REJOINED BY BROTHER ANDY AND THE REST OF THE TIME BANDIT CREW TO CELEBRATE THEIR VICTORY OF THE CAPTAIN'S SIDE WAGER. Woman: WHOO-HOO! THAT'S RARE, CATCHING THE MOTHER LODE OF KING CRAB. Johnathan: YEAH! THE ONLY WAY TO GET BETTER FISHING IS TO BUILD A BIGGER [BLEEP] POT. YEAH! MY BROTHER. YEAH, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GIVE IT TO HIM, THESE ARE THE BEST TWO CREW MEMBERS I HAVE EVER HAD. I [BLEEP] HATE HIM. I HAVE TO HEAR THIS [BLEEP] ALL YEAR LONG. "I WAS THE WINNER OF THE CRAB BET. I WAS THE WINNER OF THE CRAB BET." IT NEVER GETS BETTER THAN THIS. YEAH. Narrator: ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING KING CRAB SEASONS IS FINALLY OVER. AND THE CAPTAINS HAVE BROUGHT HOME THEIR QUOTAS. THE TIME BANDIT'S CATCH WAS WORTH $1.7 MILLION. AND EACH DECKHAND WENT HOME WITH $52,000. THE NORTHWESTERN DELIVERED 515,000 POUNDS OF LIVE CRAB WORTH $2.3 MILLION -- $59,000 FOR EACH MAN. THE CORNELIA MARIE'S SHARE OF THE BOUNTY WAS $2.1 MILLION. EACH DECKHAND GOT $48,000. THE WIZARD'S TOTAL WAS $1.5 MILLION -- $31,000 FOR EACH MAN. THE NORTH AMERICAN'S TWO-WEEK SEASON NETTED $349,000 WORTH OF KING CRAB. A DECKHAND'S SHARE -- $21,000. AND FOR THE KING CRAB SEASON, THE EARLY DAWN PULLED IN 221,000 POUNDS WORTH $978,000. EACH SHARE WAS $21,000. AFTER A QUICK CELEBRATION AT THE BAR, THE HILLSTRAND BROTHERS MAKE A SPECIAL AND PERSONAL STOP. WE'RE GOING TO DO A DRIVE-BY BY MY OLD MAN'S GRAVE. IT'S KIND OF A SPECIAL DEAL WHERE WE BURIED HIM. HE'S A MARINER, SO WE HAD TO BURY HIM NORTH TO WHERE HE COULD ALWAYS FIND HIS WAY HOME. BUT YET HE CAN SEE ALL THE BOATS COMING AND GOING WHEREVER HE'S AT. I MISS HIM. COMING BACK HERE MAKES ME MISS MY DAD, THAT'S FOR SURE. THE OLD MAN WAS A PRETTY BIG PART OF OUR LIFE. AND THEN HE WAS GONE IN TWO DAYS. 62 YEARS OLD -- DIED IN TWO DAYS SUDDENLY. Johnathan: THEY TAKE HIM OUT OF THE MORGUE AND CARRY HIM UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND PUT HIM IN THE HOLE. THAT WAS THE HARDEST THING WAS TO SHOVEL THE DIRT OVER THE TOP OF HIM. IT TOOK A FEW BOTTLES OF WHISKEY TO DO THAT [BLEEP] IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO EVEN SHOW UP AT YOUR OLD MAN'S FUNERAL, LET ALONE PUT HIM IN THE COFFIN AND DRESS HIM. WE PUT HIM IN A TIME BANDIT JACKET AND GAVE HIM A PABST BLUE RIBBON BEER AND A PACK OF CAMEL LIGHTS. ONE OF HIS FAVORITE SAYINGS WAS, "ARE YOUR ARMS PAINTED ON YOU?" THEN THE GUY WOULD SAY, "NO." AND HE'D GO, "WELL, USE THEM!" [ LAUGHTER ] [BLEEP] I LOVED THAT GUY. GOT TO DO OUR BACKWARDS SWEDISH SPIN. HERE WE GO. SWEDISH TURN. IT'S GOD'S COUNTRY. POSITION ON DECK. HE'S BURIED RIGHT UP ON THE SIDE OF THIS MOUNTAIN RIGHT HERE, ABOUT HALFWAY UP, RIGHT UP IN THERE. LET'S THROW THAT WAY. LET'S WAKE HIM UP.
