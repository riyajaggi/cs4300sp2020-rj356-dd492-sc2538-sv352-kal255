 I'LL TELL YOU, THERE'S DAYS WHEN I HATE MY JOB. Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH IS RACING TO MAKE HIS DELIVERY DEADLINE IN 20 HOURS. Keith: IT'S ALWAYS A RUDE AWAKENING WHEN YOU GET UP AND YOU SEE ICE ON YOUR STACK. Narrator: THE 3-STORY-HIGH STACK HAS BEEN BLANKETED WITH AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF ICE 4 INCHES THICK. Keith: IT'S ALWAYS A RUDE AWAKENING WHEN YOU GET UP AND YOU SEE BIG WAVES ON THE BOW. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY RUDE AWAKENING WHEN YOU SEE BOTH. I JUST WANT TO GET THIS STACK DOWN TO A MANAGEABLE POINT. AND I WANT TO GET IT OFF BEFORE THIS WEATHER GETS SO BAD THAT WE CAN'T EVEN PUT GUYS ON DECK TO DO IT. Narrator: TO STABILIZE THE VESSEL,

 CAPTAIN KEITH ORDERS THE CREW TO DITCH 40 POTS FROM THE TOP OF THE STACK. LET'S GO! LET'S GO! LET'S GO! LITTLE SAFETY PRECAUTION WHILE WE GO UP ON THE STACK. AFTER AN HOUR, THE FROTHING, 25-FOOT SEAS CHURN INTO ANGRY, 35-FOOT MONSTERS. READY? IT'S GOING OVER! WINDS HOWL TO 70 KNOTS. Keith:  THREE HIGH BACK THERE. I NEED JUST ONE MORE POT. ART, WE'LL GET THAT ONE! AND THEN I GOT TO GET THOSE TWO! Keith: DO PEOPLE SEE THIS [BLEEP] ON TV AND THEY WANT TO DO THIS? WHAT, ARE THEY [BLEEP] CRAZY? READY? YEAH, WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, MAN. GOING OVER! MARINE WATER COMING. HEADS UP. NEXT POT! OKAY, THAT'S IT! EVERYBODY OFF THE DECK, SOPER. LET'S GO! COME ON! Narrator: AFTER STABILIZING THE VESSEL... [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] YEAH? EVERYBODY'S IN. ...CAPTAIN KEITH SETS A COURSE TO DUTCH HARBOR. Keith: WE GOT THE CRAB IN THE TANKS, AND WE GOT ENOUGH GEAR OFF TO WHERE I'M FEELING COMFORTABLE. BUT NOW WE GET TO BUCK INTO IT. 30-FOOT SEA FOR A FEW HOURS HERE. THIS SHOULD BE ENTERTAINING. Narrator: SKIRTING THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE STORM FRONT, 55 MILES TO THE NORTH, IS THE TIME BANDIT. Andy: YESTERDAY, I SET ALL THE REST OF MY POTS RIGHT THROUGH ICE FLOES. THE SOUTHWESTERLY WIND IS BLOWING ALL THAT ICE AWAY, AND OUR POTS ARE FISHING. AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE STRONG 70-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS COMING... [ CHEERING ] ...AT 35-FOOT SEAS, AND THERE'S ICE FLOATING AROUND WITH IT. Narrator: CAPTAIN ANDY HAS HAD A NEAR-PERFECT SEASON. THE BOISTEROUS SKIPPER HAS CAUGHT WELL OVER 450,000 POUNDS OF OPIES IN RECORD TIME. IT'S EASY AT THE END. Johnathan: YEAH, BABY! YEAH, WE'RE GONNA GET THAT TANK FULL. BUT NOW, WITH AN ARCTIC HURRICANE FORECAST TO HIT THE GROUNDS IN 48 HOURS, THE CREW RACES TO SECURE THE REMAINING 40,000 POUNDS OF QUOTA. Andy: THIS IS IT. WE PULL THROUGH THESE 80 POTS, AND WE'RE LOADED, AND WE'RE GOING TO DUTCH HARBOR TO UNLOAD. IF WE DON'T, THE OPILIOS WILL DIE. WE'RE KICKING BUTT. OUR TIMING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER. YAHOO! I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT TANK. THAT'S A FULL TANK OF CRABBIES, PEOPLES! YEAH! SEE THOSE GUYS DOWN ON DECK IN ORANGE? THAT MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT, ESPECIALLY THE GUYS IN THE CROSSING-GUARD OUTFITS. THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM IN THAT BACK HOLD. LAST TIME, WE CAME IN 10,000 POUNDS SHY ON THAT BACK TANK. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA LET IT HAPPEN THIS TIME. Narrator: ALTHOUGH THE AFT TANK IS CHOCKED FULL OF CRAB, CAPTAIN ANDY WANTS SOME INSURANCE. STICK THE MIDDLE TANK. SEE HOW MANY I GOT, RUSS. Narrator: HE ORDERS THE CREW TO MEASURE THE SPACE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE HOLD. THANKS! WHAT'S ANDY SAYING? I DON'T KNOW. I BLOCK IT OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING. IS HE TALKING? Narrator: BUT AFTER THE TWO-MONTH MARATHON GRIND, ANDY'S ORDERS FALL ON DEAF EARS. SOMEONE STICK THAT MIDDLE TANK BEFORE YOU PUT THE HOPPER ON. WE'RE ALMOST DONE! Andy: THANK YOU, JOHNATHAN. YEP. IF THE BOSS SAYS STICK THE TANK, STICK THE [BLEEP] TANK! OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH. Fourtner: WHAT?! IF THE BOSS SAYS STICK THE TANK, STICK THE [BLEEP] TANK! WELL, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING. WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS ME TO DO SOMETHING, I'LL DO IT. BUT DON'T COME OUT AND YELL AT ME IF I DON'T HEAR HIM! WELL [BLEEP] LISTEN! WHEN THE CAPTAIN SAYS TO DO SOMETHING, YOU DO SOMETHING. THAT MUCH. THANK YOU. ME?! I DON'T HAVE A BAD ATTITUDE! OKAY, THEN COME OUT HERE AND YELL AT ME 'CAUSE I CAN'T HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON! OHH, THAT'S WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE EIGHT CAPTAINS ON YOUR BOAT. THAT'S A BAD ATTITUDE! Andy: WHAT DID HE SAY? MIKE FOURTNER [BLEEP] PISSED ME OFF JUST NOW. I KNOW. FOURTNER THINKS HE'S BEING FUN-FUN. Narrator: THERE'S TWO CARDINAL SINS THAT WILL GET YOU FIRED ON THE TIME BANDIT... "IF I CAN'T HEAR YOU, THEN HOW AM I GONNA DO IT?! TELL ME TO DO SOMETHING, I'LL DO IT!" THAT'S [BLEEP] ...DISOBEYING ORDERS... AND GETTING IN THE SKIPPER'S FACE. ONE GUY ON THIS BOAT WON'T BE GOING KING CRAB FISHING NEXT YEAR 'CAUSE WE'LL HAVE TOO MANY GUYS. SO, RUSSELL, EDDIE, MIKEY -- WHOEVER DOESN'T WORK OUT WON'T HAVE A JOB. I CAN'T HEAR YOU! WHAT? NOW I CAN HEAR YOU! WHEN I SAY STICK A [BLEEP] TANK, YOU STICK A [BLEEP] TANK. YOU WEREN'T EVEN IN TROUBLE. ALLS YOU HAD TO DO WAS WALK AWAY AND LET RUSSELL TAKE HEAT. BUT YOU JUST WALKED RIGHT INTO IT, DIDN'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU, MAN. YOU SHUT YOUR [BLEEP] MOUTH AND SAY, "YES, CAPTAIN"! YES, YOU ARE. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. OH, OH, OH, OKAY. DOES HE THINK IT'S FUNNY? I'LL FIRE HIS [BLEEP] DUDE. JOHNATHAN'S NOT GONNA COME YELL FOR NOTHING. WANT TO LOSE YOUR [BLEEP] JOB RIGHT NOW, MIKE? I'LL [BLEEP] FIRE YOUR ASS RIGHT NOW, DUMB [BLEEP] I'M SERIOUS!  THIS IS NO [BLEEP] [BLEEP] SERIOUS. I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] IF YOU HEARD OR NOT! SAY, "AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN!" YOU SAY, "OKAY!" [BLEEP] YOU, MIKE! THERE YOU GO. Man: WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT RIGHT THERE. SAY ONE MORE [BLEEP] WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED, MIKE. I SWEAR TO [BLEEP] [ FEEDBACK ] NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON. WE'RE GETTING YELLED AT, THOUGH. I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE OUT OF HAND. Narrator: AND IN CLASSIC JOHNATHAN STYLE, IF ONE RIBBING DOESN'T DO THE TRICK, WELL, TRY ANOTHER. YOU COULD HAVE JUST SAID, "OKAY, WE DIDN'T HEAR YOU." YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE -- "IF I HEAR, THEN I'LL DO IT. "BUT IF HE DOESN'T SAY THAT, I'M NOT GONNA DO IT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR IT!" [ LAUGHS ] GIVE A [BLEEP] WE'LL GET RID OF THESE CAMERAS. WE'LL GET ANOTHER GUY THAT JUST SAYS, "OKAY, CAPTAIN. SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU." YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL THE CAMERA AND EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. STUPID [BLEEP] THAT CAMERA RIGHT NOW. SEE, THEY START THINKING THEY'RE FAMILY AFTER A WHILE. AND THEY THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH [BLEEP] BUT YOU CAN'T. THEY JUST PROVED IT RIGHT THERE. ANYBODY CAN GO ANY TIME. Narrator: THE LAST POT OF THE OPILIO SEASON CLEARS THE RAIL. BUT THERE IS NO CELEBRATION. SOME WEIRD THINGS ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW, YES, JUST... YOU SEE ANYBODY ELSE MOUTHING OFF? I DON'T SEE ANYBODY MOUTHING OFF DOWN THERE ANYMORE, NEAL. GOD, THERE'S SO MUCH I WANT TO SAY. Narrator: 17 HOURS LATER -- 9:00 A.M., DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE THE LIGHTS OF DUTCH HARBOR. I LOVE TO SEE THE LIGHTS OF THE UNISEA BAR. [ LAUGHS ] Andy: WE GOT OUR LAST TRIP. WE'RE HEADED IN TO BE DONE FOR OPILIO '09 SEASON, BE DONE. Narrator: THE HILLSTRAND BROTHERS CHECK OFF ANOTHER SEASON IN THE BOOKS. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME HELL AND SOME HEAVEN -- HEAVEN AND HELL. I HAD THE ICE BY THE COJONES! Narrator: BUT FOR THE CREW, THE END OF THE SEASON IS BITTERSWEET. BY DAY'S END, ONE OF THEM WILL BE FIRED. Fourtner: IT FEELS VERY WEIRD TODAY. IT'S THE END OF AN OPILIO SEASON, BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT. AND A VERY, VERY WEIRD DAY TODAY. Newberry: THIS IS THE DAY I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. WE OFF-LOAD THESE CRAB, GET THIS BOAT TO HOMER WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK. BUT I THINK I'M GONNA STICK WITH THESE HILLSTRANDS FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS, YOU KNOW, BARRING AN ACCIDENT OF SOME SORT. Andy: GENTLEMEN, IN 12 HOURS, WE'LL KNOW WHAT WE GOT, AND WE'LL BE DONE WITH OPILIO '09. Narrator: AS DAY BREAKS, THE LAST OF THE TIME BANDIT'S $900,000 OPILIO QUOTA IS OFF-LOADED. BUT FOR ONE UNLUCKY FISHERMAN... SO, THE EASY WAY TO DO THIS, 'CAUSE SOMEONE'S GOT TO GO... ...THE NEW DAWN MARKS THE END OF A CAREER AS A TIME BANDIT CREWMAN. I WANTED TO KEEP MY KID AROUND. HE'S FAMILY. NO. SO WE GOT TO LET SOMEBODY GO, AND I GOT IT DOWN TO RUSSELL AND MIKE. ANYWAY...THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO THIS MORNING. ON PAPER, IT MAY SEEM EASY. BUT WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT, FIRING A GOOD FRIEND JUST PLAIN SUCKS. MIKE, YOU'VE BEEN A BIG PART OF THIS BOAT. WE BROUGHT YOU BACK, AND WE GOT JOHNNY. IT'S NOT ABOUT FRIENDSHIP. IT'S ABOUT BUSINESS. AND THERE'S TOO MANY OF US. HERE'S KING CRAB '09. YOU GOT J.J. HE'S RUNNING THE BOAT. EDDIE'S TENDERING. SCOTT. THAT LEAVES RUSSELL AND MIKE. ONE OF YOU GUYS HAS TO GO. WELL, MIKE... YOU BRING TO THE TABLE WAY MORE THAN RUSSELL. THAT'S WHY I GOT TO KEEP YOU. [ LAUGHS ] HERE'S THE TALK I'M GIVING YOU, AND I'M SAYING YOU'RE SAFE. YOU'RE IN THE SAFETY NET. JOHNATHAN HAS SPOKEN. MIKE FOURTNER HAS MADE THE CUT. NOW JOHNATHAN MUST DELIVER THE NEWS TO HIS LIFELONG FRIEND. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE EIGHT GUYS ON THE BOAT. ONE OF YOU GUYS -- SO, YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO SIT OUT THE KING CRAB SEASON NEXT YEAR. BUT AT LEAST -- WELL, WE'LL FIND OUT AND FIND OUT WHAT THEM TWO GUYS WANT TO DO, AND WE GO FROM THERE. 'CAUSE THESE TWO GUYS ARE DEFINITELY GOING. AND THEN WE BROUGHT MIKEY BACK 'CAUSE HE RAN THE BOAT LAST SUMMER. SO, FOR RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE A KING CRAB JOB NEXT YEAR. PERFECT. I HATE KING CRABBING ANYWAY. BUT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN, YOU KNOW? J.J. COULD HAVE A HEART ATTACK, OR WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? EDDIE COULD BREAK HIS LEG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. YOU COULD HIT HIM WITH YOUR TRUCK. BUT FOR JUST RIGHT NOW, I GOT TOO MANY GUYS. SO I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW. AND YOU'RE ALWAYS A FRIEND OF MINE, ALWAYS. IT'S JUST A BUSINESS THING. SO, RIGHT NOW, THIS IS THE WAY IT IS. NOT WORKING OUT, BUT WE WILL SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME. YOU'RE ALWAYS A TIME BANDIT. NEVER SAW THIS HAPPEN. YOU'RE A TIME BANDIT ALWAYS. WELL, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A GOODBYE NOW. NO, WE'RE NOT -- JUST FOR KING CRAB RIGHT NOW. YEAH. SO... I'LL LET YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S ALL. OKAY. THAT'S THAT. [ COUGHS ] I JUST GOT FIRED, BY GOLLY. GUESS HE'S GOT SOME LEGITIMATE EXCUSES, I GUESS, OR WHATEVER. I'VE BEEN WITH HIM THE LONGEST. YOU KNOW, GOT ACED OUT BY THE NEW GUYS, I GUESS. YEAH, WIZARD, WIZARD, WIZARD.  TIME BANDIT, TIME BANDIT. YOU GOT ME HERE, KEITH? SO...I GUESS THEY DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE. WE'RE JUST WONDERING IF YOU STILL NEEDED ANOTHER GUY. [ CLEARS THROAT ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW. WE JUST TRAVELED 90 MILES FROM THE ISLAND AFTER DROPPING JAKE OFF. SO THE GUYS HAD A LITTLE BREAK HERE. THEY'VE HAD A 9-, 10-HOUR RUN ON THE WAY BACK OUT. WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S MORE ROOM IN HERE. ONE LESS GUY. Narrator: 48 HOURS AGO, DECKHAND JAKE ANDERSON RECEIVED A DEVASTATING PHONE CALL. YEAH. HIS SISTER HAD PASSED AWAY. TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOM! BE SAFE, YOU GUYS! WE HAVE A DELIVERY DATE TO MAKE, AND, OBVIOUSLY, THE TIME WE SPENT GOING IN REALLY BEAT THAT DAY UP. AND NOW WE'VE GOT TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME. Narrator: NOW THE FOUR-MAN CREW WILL RACE TO CATCH THE LAST 70,000 POUNDS OF SIG'S OPILIO QUOTA. AND THEY'LL ONLY HAVE 72 HOURS TO DO IT. Sig: FOUR GUYS ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE. THAT EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE OUT THERE. YOU GO FROM A FIVE-MAN DECK TO A FOUR-MAN DECK... YOU KNOW IT. THEIR BODY TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARM BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING UP FOR THE LOSS OF A GUY. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO [BLEEP] UP RIGHT NOW. Edgar: IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES TILL SOMEBODY GETS HURT. WHOO-HOO! ALL RIGHT, OFF TO A GOOD START. GOOD 300, 400. Narrator: THE FIRST POT IS STUFFED WITH 475 KEEPERS. THE FRONT TANK'S ALREADY STOPPED UP FIRST POT. IF SIG CAN MAINTAIN THIS AVERAGE, HE SHOULD HAVE WHAT HE NEEDS TO CLOSE OUT THE SEASON IN THE NEXT FIVE STRINGS. Sig: THE GOAL FOR TODAY IS JUST TO HAUL AS MANY POTS AS WE CAN, TRY TO GET THAT TANK CLOSE TO FULL. AND WE GOT TO KEEP THE GEAR ON CONSISTENT FISHING. WHOO-HOO! Narrator: 3 HOURS AND 30 POTS LATER, THE NUMBERS ARE STEADILY RISING. BUT THE TEMPERATURE ON DECK HAS DROPPED TO 30 BELOW. Sig: THE COLD SLOWS EVERYTHING DOWN AND, AT THE SAME TIME, MAKES EVERYTHING TWICE AS MISERABLE. WHOA! WHOA! Sig: YOU GUYS GOOD? DID THAT  GET CLOSE TO ANYBODY? Edgar: NO! ARE THOSE DOGS  FREEZING UP? NO, THEY WERE ON. POPPED RIGHT OUT -- IT WAS WEIRD. Man: POPPED OUT. DOGS WERE ON. KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES. Edgar: WE GOT A LITTLE WORK TO DO. HAUL A COUPLE MORE STRINGS, I THINK. MORE THAN WE THOUGHT. Sig: RIGHT NOW, OUR ENEMY IS THE WEATHER AND TIME. AND AS THE WEATHER INCREASES, OUR TIME DECREASES. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER. Narrator: 378 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE FISHING GROUNDS, BACK IN DUTCH, THE 155-FOOT WIZARD IS TIED UP AT THE DOCK AND OFF-LOADING THEIR 375,000 POUNDS OF CRAB. WE'RE LOOKING FANTASTIC RIGHT NOW. Narrator: AFTER GRINDING THROUGH ANOTHER TOUGH TRIP WITH A RAGTAG CREW OF INJURED VETERANS AND INEXPERIENCED GREENHORNS, KEITH NOW NEEDS TO REPLACE HIS MOST RELUCTANT GREENHORN, JOSH WARNER. WE'LL FINISH THIS OFF-LOAD, TAKE SOME FUEL, AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A CREW TO GO FISH WITH. THERE'S SOME GUYS ON THE BEACH NOW. WE'RE GETTING INTO THE SEASON NOW WHERE BOATS ARE STARTING TO SHUT DOWN. AND SO THERE ARE SOME GUYS ON THE BEACH. SO I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE START DIGGING AROUND TOWN HERE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND A FAIRLY QUALITY SET OF HANDS. Narrator: KEITH'S PLAN IS TO HEAD BACK OUT AS SOON AS THE OFF-LOAD IS FINISHED. HE NEEDS A DECKHAND, AND FAST. I GOT A COUPLE OPTIONS. ONE OF THEM'S A GREENHORN I GOT TO GO CHECK ON. YOU KNOW, WE TAKE ANOTHER INEXPERIENCED GUY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ASKING A LOT, 'CAUSE BOTTOM LINE IS HALF OF THE GUYS THAT COME OUT HERE SUCK. WE MIGHT END UP WITH ONE OF THEM THAT'S A TOTAL TURD. [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ SNICKERING ] Man: SOMETHING SMELLY. THERE IS ANOTHER...THOUGHT. YOU GUYS, BE HONEST. RUSSELL JUST GOT CANNED ON THE TIME BANDIT. Man: WHAT THE HELL? HE GOT FIRED. JOHNATHAN'S JUST -- HE'S OVERSTAFFED. NO WAY. WHAT'D HE DO? WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? HOW MANY TIMES HAS RUSSELL SAID, "I WANT TO COME WORK FOR YOU GUYS" IN THE BAR? LeVeen: YEAH, HE SAID IT. I DON'T KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT RUSSELL IS THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A SAUNA FOR HIM TO SIT IN IN BETWEEN POTS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOBODY SEEMED TO SAY NO TO THE RUSSELL IDEA. I WOULDN'T MIND WORKING WITH RUSSELL. I WAS EXPECTING SOMEBODY TO GO, "OH, GOD, NO." BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. I THINK THE GUY'S ENTERTAINING. YEAH, I THINK HE IS, TOO, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. Narrator: ON DECK, MORE THAN 900,000 POUNDS OF OPIES HAVE BEEN HAULED ASHORE. THIS COULD BE AN ALL-TIME HIGH FOR THAT HATCH. Narrator: BUT IN THE WHEELHOUSE, KEITH STILL HAS ONE MORE THING TO OFFICIALLY OFF-LOAD -- HIS GREENHORN. KEITH, I WAS GONNA TRY AND -- I WAS GONNA ASK YOU IF I CAME UP IN SEPTEMBER, IF I DID GEAR WORK FOR FREE FOR YOU, IF MAYBE I COULD GET A FREE RIDE UP TO DUTCH. I WOULD BE CRAZY TO BRING YOU BACK ON HERE. EVERY GUY ON THIS BOAT KNOWS THAT YOU QUIT THREE TIMES. I THINK IT WAS ONLY TWICE. I MEAN, I WAS HAVING ISSUES EARLIER. YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. YOU CAN STOP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A BLEEDING HEART AT THIS POINT IN THE SEASON. I MEAN, I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW? WE'VE ALL HAD A ROUGH GO AT IT. BOTTOM LINE IS, IF IT'S TIME TO GO, IT'S TIME TO GO. I WOULD SAY IT'S TIME TO PACK YOUR STUFF UP, AND MAKE SURE YOU PACK IT ALL, 'CAUSE I'M NOT BRINGING YOU BACK. LeVeen: THE HAPPIEST I'VE SEEN JOHN -- JOSH, WHATEVER, JOSH -- FOR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF IS TODAY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WAS LEAVING. BUT HE COULDN'T EVEN GET HIS [BLEEP] BAGS PACKED IN TIME TO GET THE RIGHT FLIGHT OUT. COME ON! COME ON, JOSH! PACK YOUR [BLEEP] BAGS IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE! Narrator: NOW, ALTHOUGH KEITH HAS GOTTEN RID OF SOME DEADWEIGHT, BEFORE HE LEAVES PORT, HE'LL HAVE TO FIND A REPLACEMENT. JOSH! DON'T LEAVE US, JOSH! DON'T LEAVE US HANGING! DON'T LEAVE US! [ Echoing ] OH, MY GOD, JOSH! Narrator: 356 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, ABOARD THE NORTHWESTERN, THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TORMENT CONTINUES. Sig: I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE WHEN I SAY I'M SICK OF IT. YEAH, ROG. AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BLOW WEST 50, 60, ALL THE WAY TO DUTCH HARBOR. SO WE STILL NEED TO GET SERIOUS AND GET THESE THINGS ON BOARD. Narrator: SINCE THE ARCTIC HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO HIT THE GROUNDS BY DAY'S END... I'M HERE FOR YOU. THANK YOU. ...SIG TOLD THE MEN THEY'D GET SOME EXTRA REST BEFORE HE'D GRIND THEM INTO THE GROUND BY STACKING ALL 150 POTS ON DECK. THAT WAS A 30-HOUR DAY YESTERDAY. THAT'S AN EXTRA 45 MINUTES OF SLEEP, PLUS LIKE A HALF-HOUR WAKE-UP, WHICH IS ALWAYS NICE. THEY THINK THEY GOT AN EXTRA 45 MINUTES. YEAH, HE GAVE US AN EXTRA HOUR SO WE COULD GET... BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW... Narrator: BUT, AS SOON AS SIG GIVETH... IT'S AN OLD TRICK. NOBODY EVER SAID YOU CAN'T SET THE CLOCK AHEAD A LITTLE BIT. Narrator: ...SIG TAKETH AWAY. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS. [ LAUGHS ] RIGHT NOW, PRIORITY IS TO GET THE GEAR ON AND GET IN. WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO ROLL THE DICE. I MEAN, THE GEAR'S ALL SET. IT'S ALL BAITED. THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT IT BUT JUST GO THROUGH IT AND HOPE THAT WE, YOU KNOW, HIT OUR NUMBER. WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF THAT ONE? WAS THAT ABOUT 250? ROGER! ROGER! WELL, THE LAST TRIP -- WE ONLY GOT ANOTHER 150 POTS TO HAUL, AND WE'RE OUT OF HERE -- SHOULD BE HAPPY. IT NEVER WORKS OUT THAT WAY, THOUGH. WE START SEEING ANYTHING LESS, YOU KNOW, LIKE AROUND 100 OR SO, I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE QUOTA THAT WE NEED. 75. Edgar: 70, 75. 75? OUCH. ARE YOU SURE? Narrator: THE POTS ARE COMING UP WITH FEMALES AND JUVENILES. WHOA! NO! THE GUYS WERE WORKING MORE FOR LESS WITH ONE LESS GUY, YOU KNOW? Narrator: WHAT WERE ONCE FERTILE GROUNDS HAVE NOW QUICKLY TURNED INTO A JUNKYARD. I WANT THIS TO BE OVER WITH. Narrator: BUT WITH 120 POTS STILL FISHING... [ YAWNS ] ...AND A HURRICANE 30 HOURS AWAY... JUST WANT TO GET OFF THIS PIECE OF STEEL, THAT'S ALL. ...THE CREW HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO GRIND TO THE FINISH LINE. Sig: WE MAY HAVE TO STICK IT OUT HERE FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO. AND WITH THIS WEATHER, YOU KNOW, ONE DAY CAN TURN INTO FIVE REAL EASY. AND SO I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE GOT WHAT WE NEED. Narrator: BACK IN DUTCH, NEWS THAT RUSSELL'S A FREE AGENT HAS SWEPT THE DOCKS, WITH THE WIZARD LOOKING FOR A NEW HAND. HEY, KEITH. HEY, WHAT'S UP? HOW ARE YOU? NOT BAD. HOW YOU DOING? HAVE A SEAT. GOOD TO SEE YOU. Narrator: KEITH TAKES THE FIRST MEETING. I HEARD YOU MIGHT BE AVAILABLE. YEAH, READY TO MAKE A DIFFERENT MOVE HERE. RIGHT NOW, I HAVE NOTHING ELSE GOING ON. I RUN AN EIGHT-MAN DECK, OKAY -- EIGHT-MAN TOTAL. WE GO 18 ON, 6 OFF, ALL RIGHT? IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE MY OFFER HERE, ALL I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IS $25,000 TO $30,000 FOR OPIE MONEY. OKAY. AND -- WHAT'S THIS GONNA DO FOR ME DURING KING CRAB NEXT YEAR? I'M GONNA BE HONEST. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU, SEE HOW YOU WORK WITH THE CREW. SURE. ALL RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK THAT I'M READY TO DO IT, YOU KNOW? IF YOU DON'T MIND, WELL, THEN, LET'S MAKE A TRIP OUT OF IT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. CAN YOU BE READY TO GO, LIKE, IN FIVE MINUTES? FIVE MINUTES. I'M READY TO GO IN FIVE MINUTES. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. WELCOME ABOARD. ALL RIGHT, KEITH. YOU'RE MY NEW BOSS. STRANGER THINGS, MAN. OKAY, PAL. I'M ON THE WIZARD TEAM NOW! THE WIZARD TEAM, BABY! THE WIZARD! I'M ON THE WIZARD! Narrator: NOW, BEFORE RUSS JOINS HIS NEW BROTHERS, HE MAKES ONE LAST PIT STOP ON THE TIME BANDIT. Fourtner: YOU TALK TO KEITH? I DID. HOW'D THAT GO? GOOD. HE CAN OFFER ME A JOB THAT, YOU KNOW, JOHNATHAN COULDN'T OFFER ME. SIX HOURS AGO, I DIDN'T HAVE A JOB. I WAS GOING HOME, FLYING HOME. AND NOW I'M ON ANOTHER BOAT JUST LIKE THAT. AND, ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE A GOOD THING... YOU GUYS HIRING? [ LAUGHTER ] OH, I'M JUST WATCHING THE ACTION HERE. IT'S CRAZY -- JUST LIKE THAT. RUSS AND I HAVE JOKED ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES, AND THEN NOW IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING. YOU GOT IT. IT'S GOT ALL MY GEAR IN IT, YOU KNOW. THANK YOU. AND THEN THIS LITTLE ONE, AND THEN I'M DONE. I'M DONE WITH THE TIME BANDIT. ALL RIGHT, MIKE. SMOOTH SAILING FOR YOU, BUDDY. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. TAKE CARE, MAN. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT, EITHER. I DON'T LIKE ANY [BLEEP] PART OF IT. Fourtner: MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT IT HAD TO GO DOWN LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW? HOPEFULLY HE FINDS A GOOD HOME ON THE WIZARD. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Narrator: NOW ONE QUESTION REMAINS -- HAS JOHNATHAN MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE? I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST HIRED RUSSELL NEWBERRY. THAT IS SO BIZARRE. THE FACT THAT HE'S EVEN AVAILABLE AMAZES ME. SO TIME BANDIT'S LOSS --  WIZARD'S GAIN. WE'LL TAKE IT. WELCOME HOME. Narrator: FISHING IN 20-FOOT SEAS 348 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR... CREEPING AROUND HERE, YOU'RE GONNA GET WET. ...IS THE NORTHWESTERN. THE FOUR-MAN CREW IS SLOWLY TRUDGING THROUGH THEIR 50th STRAIGHT HOUR OF BACKBREAKING WORK. AND NOW... [ RADIO BEEPS ] HURRICANE. WOW. WHOA. [ RADIO BEEPS ] OH, I KNOW. I KNOW. I'M GONNA GET THESE ON AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Sig: WE DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK OUT HERE WITH 60-KNOT WINDS. I DON'T WANT AN ENGINE FAILURE. I DON'T WANT HYDRAULIC FAILURES. WE DON'T WANT TO BLOW OUT OUR WINDOWS. WE REALLY NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE. I'M GONNA MESS WITH THE GUYS A LITTLE BIT, SEE IF I CAN GET A REACTION OUT OF THEM. HERE'S YOUR OPTION. YOU COULD PULL TOMORROW  IN 65, OR YOU CAN PULL ALL NIGHT  AND STAY ALIVE. 'CAUSE HE'S A POET AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT. THAT'S YOUR CHOICE. NOW THEY'RE HUDDLING. EVERY TIME I GIVE THEM THE "OPTION," IT'S LIKE TRYING TO BE THE NICE GUY, ONLY IT BACKFIRES 'CAUSE THEN THEY'RE LIKE, "I'M SO CONFUSED! I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- AAH! WHAT DO I DO?" YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THEN THEY START THINKING, "WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO, RIGHT?" AND JUST THE FACT THAT I EVEN MENTIONED THE FACT THAT THERE'S AN OPTION THAT THEY CAN DO THAT, THAT'S GONNA IRRITATE THEM. IT'S UP TO YOU.  YOU GOT THE OPTION. YOU CAN CALL IT A NIGHT OR JUST GET IT OVER WITH -- WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. I'M LIKE THE KING OF MANIPULATION WITH THEM. THAT'S JUST HOW IT WORKS. EVERYBODY'S IN OVERDRIVE TRYING TO GET THIS CRAB DOWN AND GET THE POTS ON AND GET IT MOVED AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE AND GO HOME. YOU GUYS GOT IT, THEN? Narrator: WHETHER IT'S THEIR MANIACAL SKIPPER... YEAH, I'VE GOT THEM TRAINED TO SUFFER. Narrator: ...AN ARCTIC HURRICANE... OR WORKING A MAN DOWN... ...THE CREW SEES THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND SUCKS IT UP FOR THE LAST 10,000 POUNDS OF CRAB. [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON, MAVAR! [ EXPLOSION ] [BLEEP] [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH! YOU DID IT, GUYS. LAST POT OF YOUR OPIE SEASON  COMING UP HERE. END OF THE SEASON STAPLE -- THE FLAMING HOOK. IT'S GOOD LUCK IF HE MAKES THE SHOT. IF HE MISSES, WE'RE GONNA HAVE BAD LUCK FOR NEXT SEASON. $85 A GALLON. AWAY FROM THE CAN. WHOA, DUDE. YEAH! OH, I GOT IT IN MY EYE! ALL RIGHT, COME ON! OH, BOY. WAITING FOR THIS FEELING FOR, WHAT, TWO MONTHS NOW. GOOD JOB, GUYS. ALL RIGHT! WHOO-HOO! I'M GOING HOME. THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING. WELL, LET'S HOPE  WE HAVE ENOUGH. I'VE HAD ENOUGH! I'VE DEFINITELY HAD ENOUGH! [ LAUGHS ] I JUST WANT TO CRAWL INTO MY CAVE AND DIE FOR A WHILE. BRING AS MANY POTS DOWN AS WE CAN, PUT THE CHAIN ON, HEAD IN, HEAD FOR ST. PAUL. Sig: JUST DUCK IN THERE, GET UNDER COVER TILL THIS WEATHER BLOWS OVER, AND THEN CONTINUE ON DOWN TO DUTCH HARBOR. IT FEELS GREAT TO GET ALL THE POTS ON AND KNOW THAT WE'RE DONE FISHING. IT JUST FEELS LIKE I STILL HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US. Narrator: AS THEY FINISH THE SEASON, THE FINAL TALLIES ARE IN FOR THE NORTHWESTERN AND TIME BANDIT. Keith: WE'RE GONNA GET KICKED BY THESE SOUTHERLIES. WHAT I DON'T LIKE OUT HERE IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THEY FORECAST A REAL NASTY STORM, WE END UP GETTING SOMETHING EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT THEY FORECAST. AND THIS IS THE WORST STORM THEY'VE FORECAST ALL YEAR. WE'RE GONNA GET 75- AND 40-FOOTERS. 40-FOOT SEAS ARE BAD NEWS. JUST GOT TO TRY AND GET EVERYTHING IN THE WATER, GET THE GEAR FISHING, AND THEN JUST BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES AND TRY AND RIDE IT OUT. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. WHEN IT'S READY, GO AHEAD AND GET RID OF IT. Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH HAS 50 TONS OF GEAR STACKED ON DECK. HE WANTS IT IN THE WATER BEFORE THE STORM HITS FULL FORCE. DEFINITELY STAY SHARP BACK THERE. ONE POT AT A TIME, OKAY? ONE AT A TIME,  AND WATCH YOURSELF. I DON'T WANT THAT GEAR SITTING UP ON THAT FORWARD DECK. WE MIGHT START TAKING STUFF OVER THE BOW THAT COULD BE ENOUGH TO START TOSSING THOSE POTS ON US. YEAH, AND IT'S FLAT WHALING OUT THERE, MAN. WHOO, I THINK IT BLEW UP A STORM! MAN. ENJOY THE RIDE. THIS IS [BLEEP] WEATHER RIGHT HERE. THE WIND CHANGED. IT WENT FROM NOTHING TO 50 IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES. YEAH. YEAH. JUST LIKE THAT, BOOM. IT'S NOT BLOWING. IT'S SMOKING OUT THERE. AND IT'S LITERALLY SMOKING.
