 IT'S BLOWING ABOUT 40 MILES AN HOUR RIGHT NOW OUTSIDE. AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRY AND PUT THIS 40x40-FOOT SQUARE TARP UP ON THE BOW OF THE BOAT TO KEEP THE ICE FROM STICKING TO THE FRONT OF THE STACK. THAT LITERALLY WILL BECOME A WALL OF ICE IF WE DON'T DO THAT. THIS IS NOT A FISHING STRATEGY. THIS IS A SELF-PRESERVATION STRATEGY. THAT TARP'S GOT TO GO UP. IT'S GOT TO GO UP FAST. GOOD LUCK.

MONTE GOT THROWN INTO THE DRAG ANCHOR. MOUSE GOT HIT HARD IN THE CHEST. WHERE AM I BLEEDING? IT GOT ME FROM BEHIND. I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT COMING. I JUST WENT FACE [BLEEP] FIRST RIGHT INTO THE HOPPERS AND THAT DRAG HOOK. THIS IS JUST BAD. STUPID IDEA. START DIGGING THE BOXES OUT -- YOU'LL FIND IT, RIGHT? WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET ON THIS ONE. LET'S JUST FIND OUT. OKAY. MOUSE, LET'S GET YOU IN AND GET YOU LAYING DOWN. LET'S GET AN ASSESSMENT ON HOW YOUR RIBS ARE DOING, OKAY? OKAY? ARE YOU WITH ME? YEAH. Narrator: THREE BRUISED AND BATTERED DECKHANDS ARE DOWN. Man: IF YOU CAN, JUST SO THAT IT'S POINTING UP. THE EXTENT OF ANY INTERNAL INJURIES ARE UNKNOWN. SEE THAT RED BAG I HAVE HANGING NEXT TO THE MIRROR? Keith: GET HIS FEET UP IN THE AIR. MOUSE, IF YOU CAN LAY ON YOUR BACK, PLEASE LAY ON YOUR BACK JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANY KIND OF SHOCK THAT MIGHT SET IN HERE, OKAY? OH, MAN, THAT HURT. YOU GOT SOME HANDY? YEAH, GO AHEAD AND GRAB SOME.

LET ME GO CHECK THE OTHER KIT, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT SOME SERIOUS INTERNAL BLEEDING GOING ON UNDER YOUR EYE. BEYOND YOUR HEAD, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING GOING ON?

HEAD AND NECK ARE OKAY, RIGHT? YEAH. YOU'RE SURE? IT'S SWELLING, AND IT'S STARTING TO HURT QUITE A BIT MORE. OHH. HERE, ROLL THIS WAY. YEAH, YOU GOT DINGED -- BIG BRUISE. BOY. WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE SOMETIMES WE GET ASKED TO DO THINGS THAT ARE PRETTY CRAZY TO SAVE US FROM DOING THINGS THAT ARE EVEN CRAZIER. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT WAVE CAME FROM, BUT IT SURE [BLEEP] US UP. Man: A LITTLE BIT. REALLY SLOW, THOUGH. Man #2: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. THAT ONE'S OKAY. THIS ONE'S REACTING REALLY SLOW. HE'S GOT A LOT OF EXTRA BLOOD FLOW TO THAT AREA. YEAH, I THINK THERE'S GETTING A LITTLE PRESSURE ON THAT ONE. I CAN'T EVEN TAKE A FULL, DEEP BREATH. WE'LL SEE -- GET INTO TOWN AND GET EVERYBODY LOOKED AT AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THE REST OF OUR SEASON. STAND BY TO STAND BY. Narrator: 330 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 115-FOOT TIME BANDIT. OKAY, COMING UP. Narrator: CAPTAIN ANDY HAS GAMBLED HALF HIS GEAR ON A SPOT CALLED "MR. MAGOO," THE SACRED FAMILY FISHING GROUNDS THAT PAID OFF LAST SEASON. BUT NOW... IT'S A BUST. Andy: SO, WE HAVE NO CRAB ON BOARD. I HEARD, "DON'T GO TO MAGOO, 'CAUSE THERE'S HUNDREDS THERE," AND I STILL SAID, "I GOT TO GO THERE AND TRY IT." [ WINCH GRINDS ] Narrator: CAPTAIN ANDY DECIDED TO GO WITH HIS GUT. I GOT JACK SQUAT. Narrator: NOW THE CREW WILL STACK ON THE 30 POTS AND PRAY THAT ANDY'S NORTHERN SET OF GEAR IS ON BETTER FISHING. SO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, THERE AIN'T NOTHING THERE THIS YEAR. WE'VE BEEN FISHING FOR 36 HOURS AND HAVEN'T MADE A FRICKIN' DIME YET. WE'RE GETTING LIKE 150 CRAB AND ONLY 7 KEEPERS IN A POT. THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD FISHING. Narrator: SINCE IT'S NOT WORTH SORTING THROUGH THE JUNK FOR A HANDFUL OF KEEPERS, THE CREW DECIDES TO RAIL-DUMP THE CRAB. Andy:  IF YOU WANT TO RAIL-DUMP, YOU BETTER [BLEEP] GET  THAT POT OFF THE RACK. [BLEEP] YOU GUYS. Narrator: THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE, ESPECIALLY WITH CAPTAIN ANDY'S DELIVERY DEADLINE IN FOUR DAYS. I KNOW HE'S UNDER A LOT OF STRESS. LOOK AT HIM UP THERE. THROW THE HOOK. WHEN I SAY THERE'S A POT COMING UP, I WANT THE GUY TO THROW THE HOOK. THAT'S MY BOTTOM LINE. IF YOU'RE GONNA RAIL-DUMP THEM, [BLEEP] GET THEM ON MY [BLEEP] BOAT AS FAST AS YOU CAN. Narrator: THE LAST POT IS SECURED ON THE DECK. NOW CAPTAIN ANDY SETS A COURSE TOWARD HIS NORTHERN STRINGS. WE'RE GONNA RUN UP 60 MILES TO GO SEE THE ICE PACK -- NORTHWEST TOWARDS RUSSIA. NO GUTS, NO GLORY. THIS IS IT, MAN. WE GOT TO FIND THE CRAB. Narrator: AS THE MOON RISES OVER THE BERING SEA, A 200-SQUARE-MILE ARCTIC SQUALL COLLIDES WITH THE GROUNDS, AND FISHING IN THE HEART OF IT IS THE 106-FOOT INCENTIVE. 20-FOOT SEAS... 70-MILE GUSTS... AND TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO MINUS-10 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. THIS BOAT HERE IS A BIG LITTLE BOAT. IT PACKS OVER 200,000 POUNDS OF CRAB. AND IT'S A SWEET RIDE. IT'S GOT THE HOUSE RAISED UP SO YOU GOT GOOD VISIBILITY. EXCELLENT DECK SETUP FOR SORTING CRAB -- YOU'LL SEE WE GOT THE OPIE RIVER HERE. AND THESE GUYS CAN GET THE CRAB DOWN FASTER THAN I CAN GET TO THE NEXT POT, JUST ABOUT. YOU KNOW, 500, 600 CRAB -- THAT'S A LOT. Narrator: CAPTAIN HARRY LEWIS AND HIS 6-MAN CREW ARE BACK ON THE CRAB GROUNDS AFTER OFF-LOADING 152,000 POUNDS OF OPIES FOR A QUICK 258,000 BUCKS. Lewis: YEAH, WE'RE ALL PUMPED UP, THOUGH. WE'RE READY TO GO ROUND TWO HERE AND KEEP THIS BABY ROLLING. WE'RE LOOKING TO GET A LITTLE OVER 200,000 POUNDS THIS TRIP. PLUG THIS BABY. Narrator: WIND, WAVES, AND WEATHER CONTINUE TO BUILD. BUT HARRY IS NO ROOKIE CAPTAIN. DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL [BLEEP] MAN. YOU GOT TO GO FOR IT IN THIS GAME. Narrator: HARRY'S BEEN A MEMBER OF THE ELITE GROUP OF BERING SEA CRAB-BOAT SKIPPERS FOR 20 YEARS. Lewis: WHEN YOU GET UP TO THIS LEVEL, THE WINTERTIME FISHING OUT HERE NEXT TO THE POLAR ICE CAP, THERE AIN'T NO SLOUCHES OUT HERE. AT THIS LEVEL, EVERY GUY OUT HERE RUNNING A BOAT... HE'S FOR REAL. Narrator: BUT 18 YEARS AGO, CAPTAIN HARRY LOST OVER $35,000 WORTH OF GEAR WHEN IT WAS SWALLOWED BY THE ICE. IT WAS A DEVASTATING LOSS THAT LEFT HIM GUN-SHY. SO THIS YEAR, CAPTAIN HARRY IS HEDGING HIS BETS ON SOUTHERN GROUNDS, 80 MILES FROM THE ICE AND THE REST OF THE FLEET. WE KNOW IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. THAT WIND'S GONNA SWING AROUND, THEN THE ICE IS REALLY GONNA COME DOWN AGAIN. AND I'M NOT REAL EXCITED ABOUT GOING UP INTO THE ICE AND HAVING THE ICE COME INTO ME, EITHER. IT CAN ALL CHANGE REAL QUICK. Narrator: THE ICE HAS A LIFE AND MIND OF ITS OWN, CONSTANTLY GROWING AND SHIFTING, SWALLOWING UP HUNDREDS OF MILES OF CRAB GROUNDS ON VERY SHORT NOTICE. IT MAKES FISHING THIS TIME OF YEAR BOTH CHALLENGING AND PERILOUS. Lewis: SO, THIS IS THE EDGE. WE'RE FISHING ON THE EDGE. BUT RIGHT NOW THE TIDES ARE SLACKING, AND WE'RE THINKING THE CRAB ARE GOING UP THERE TOWARDS THE FOOTBALL. AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY, OR I'LL HAVE TO KILL YOU. Narrator: NOW THE CREW PREPARES TO START HAULING A STRING THEY LEFT SOAKING WHILE THEY WERE IN TOWN. Lewis: THROW HER LIKE A SNAKE'S TONGUE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME FULL SHOOMAMAS. A SHOOMAMA IS ABOUT 500 PER POT. COME ON, BABY. THE FIRST ONE'S GONNA BE... Narrator: ABOARD THE INCENTIVE, A SHOOMAMA MEANS, WELL, "WE DONE STRUCK GOLD." SHOOMAMA! THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR, AND THAT'S ABOUT A 500 AVERAGE. VERY CLEAN! FIRST POT. SEEMS PRETTY GOOD. Lewis: IF WE CAN GET A SHOOMAMA AVERAGE, THEN WE CAN GET THIS THING FULL IN THREE DAYS. WE'RE MAKING MONEY. HAH! NOW WE'RE TALKING. I THINK I JUST FOUND GOLD. [ LAUGHS ] HOLY [BLEEP] COME ON, BABY, TURN. RUNS LIKE A DEER, SMELLS LIKE A JOHN. Narrator: 11 HOURS AFTER THE TOWERING WAVE TOOK OUT THREE  WIZARD FISHERMEN... I'VE NEVER TAKEN A WAVE WITH GUYS ON THE BOW LIKE THAT. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN IS TORMENTED WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS DECISIONS. Keith: YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO KEEP THE GUYS SAFE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES OUT HERE, YOU GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF RISK, BUT YOU TRY AND MAINTAIN SAFETY AND DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN. I KNOW I'LL BE REPLAYING THIS IN MY BRAIN FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. THESE GUYS START PILING OFF DECK, ONE AFTER ANOTHER, HUNCHED OVER, BEAT UP, AND BLEEDING. [ SIGHS ] [ Voice breaking ] I'VE NEVER GOTTEN THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THAT. PHEW. GOD! AAHH! [BLEEP] AW, MAN! AW, MAN. Narrator: 200 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST, THE INCENTIVE HAS WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT AND IS NOW PULLING THE LAST OF THEIR TOWN'S SOAKED POTS. THOUGH THEY'RE 80 MILES SOUTH OF THE REST OF THE FLEET, WHEN IT COMES TO WEATHER ON THE BERING SEA, YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE. Lewis: IT'S REALLY STARTING NOW. WHEW! A LITTLE BIT SLOPPY. HOPEFULLY, ONE OF THEM SPOTS WILL SHOW US WHICH WAY THEY'RE MOVING. 'CAUSE THEY GOT LEGS, AND THEY KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] JUST KEEP GRINDING OUR WAY THROUGH THESE BABIES AND GET THEM CLEANED OUT. Narrator: CAPTAIN HARRY'S BEEN DRIVING HIS BATTLE-WEARY CREW FOR THE LAST 18 HOURS. NOT BAD. IT'S A LITTLE SORE. MY ARM'S A LITTLE SORE -- NOT TOO BAD. I'M NOT FEELING REAL HOT. [ LAUGHING ] THERE'S NO SYMPATHY IN CRAB FISHING. Lewis: COME ON, BABY. GIVE US A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT LAST POT. THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT 289 CRAB IN THAT POT, I'D SAY. BUT THEY'RE BIG -- REALLY BIG. WE'VE BEEN DOING REAL GOOD ON THIS STRING. NICE CRAB. COME ON, SHAKE IT LIKE YOU DID LAST NIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. Narrator: THE FASTER CAPTAIN HARRY CAN DIAL IN ON THE CRAB, THE SOONER THE CREW CAN GET HOME AND GET PAID. THAT GUY -- WHAT WAS HE THINKING? OH! [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] OH! WHOA! I LOOKED RIGHT AT IT. I KNOW IT WAS HOOKED, GUNNY. OKAY, READY, YOU GUYS? LET'S PULL IT BACK. Narrator: THE POT SLIPS FROM THE LAUNCHER, KILLING CRAB AND NEARLY CRUSHING SOME OF THE CREW'S HANDS. WHOA! WHOA! Canete: WELL, EVERY NOW AND THEN, IT SLIPS FOR SOME REASON. IT POPS OUT OF THE DOCK. IT USUALLY SLIPS RIGHT HERE NOW. IT'LL POP OUT. 1,300, 1,400 POUNDS A POT. IF IT HITS SOMEBODY AND LANDS ON THEM, IT COULD KILL YOU IN A HEARTBEAT. Gunderson: YOU GOT TO STAY ON THE BALL NO MATTER WHAT. Dawson: I'VE BROKEN A FEW BONES OUT HERE, I'VE HAD A CRAB LEG GO THROUGH MY EYE, I'VE LOST THE TIP OF MY FINGER, BROKE RIBS, LEGS, WRISTS, HAND. WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO? ONCE YOU'VE DONE THIS, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE. Lewis: I CAN'T REALLY DWELL ON THAT TOO MUCH. BURNING BAIT, FILLING UP THE BLACK HOLE -- THAT'S MY JOB. Narrator: 360 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE. CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS AND THE CREW PREP THE DECK FOR THE FIRST POTS OF THE OPIE SEASON. IT'S A WHOPPING 14 DEGREES OUTSIDE. Narrator: THE TEMPERATURE HAS DROPPED. ICING HAS BEGUN. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET OVERLOADED IN ICE 'CAUSE IT MAKES THE BOAT TOP-HEAVY. Narrator: CAPTAIN PHIL'S STRATEGY IS TO FISH FAST AND FURIOUS. HE'LL PULL ON A SHORT SOAK AND HOPE TO PUT A DENT IN HIS 1.2 MILLION-POUND QUOTA. Phil: I'M THINKING ABOUT THE WEATHER RIGHT NOW. IF SOMETHING DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE PRETTY QUICK, WE'RE GONNA BE SCREWED AGAIN. THE ICE IS GONNA COME DOWN, AND WE'RE OUT OF BUSINESS. Narrator: THE BONE-CHILLING ARCTIC AIR STREAM HAS PUSHED THE ICE PACK SOUTH. IT'S NOW TWO DAYS FROM SWALLOWING THE CRAB GROUNDS. Phil: WHEN THE ICE COMES DOWN, IF IT GETS IN MY POTS ON THE EDGE, IT'LL JUST PICK THEM UP AND DRAG THEM AND TAKE THEM AND SET THEM AND DROP THEM OFF IN 1,000 FATHOMS. SO YOU LOSE THEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN HERE. I REALLY DON'T. Narrator: AFTER A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE AAH! ...AND MONTHS OF RECOVERY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU CAN DIE?" Narrator: ...CAPTAIN PHIL IS BACK IN THE CHAIR, APPROACHING HIS FIRST STRING. WE'RE GONNA HAUL RIGHT INTO THE WIND, UP TO THE NORTHEAST. Narrator: BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS -- CAN HE HANDLE THE STRESS OF A BERING SEA WINTER? YEAH, THIS IS THE FIRST POT IN THE '09 OPIE SEASON. LET'S HOPE THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT. WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME CRAB ON THE BOAT TODAY. THERE'S A COUPLE IN THERE -- COUPLE HUNDRED. THERE'S A COUPLE HUNDRED. YEAH, THERE'S PROBABLY 300 IN IT FOR 11 HOURS. ARE THEY GOOD ONES? [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH! WE GOT SOMETHING IN THE TANK. SOMETHING IN THE TANK. THAT'S GOOD -- 11-HOUR SOAK, AND, I MEAN, THERE'S, I THINK, A COUPLE HUNDRED IN THAT POT. GO UP A MILE, LAY ONE, AND THEN GO AND LAY ONE GOING TO THE NORTH. Narrator: PHIL HAS FOUND SIGNS OF LIFE. NOW HE'LL HUSTLE TO CHARGE AHEAD OF THE PACK AND LET THE PREY COME TO HIM. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] BUT WITH TWO NEW CREWMAN... WHOA! WHOA! ...THE DECK IS NO LONGER A WELL-OILED MACHINE. THESE GUYS, FOR THEIR FIRST STRING, THEY GOT TO GET USED TO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, SO... THIS GROUP OF GUYS -- STEVE HASN'T HAULED AN OPIE POT IN YEARS, YOU KNOW? THE LAST TIME I FISHED OPIE WAS PROBABLY 8 OR 9 YEARS AGO -- SOMETHING LIKE THAT, MAYBE LONGER, I DON'T KNOW. Narrator: AND ABOARD A CRAB BOAT, THERE IS NO SYMPATHY FOR RUSTY DECKHANDS. HEY, STEVE, ONE TIME! ONE TIME! ONE TIME! THIS [BLEEP] [BLEEP] HEY, YOU DON'T GOT TO PUT IT AWAY EVERY TIME THAT WE USE IT. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE HARRIS BOYS ARE RIDING THE NEW ENGINEER, STEVE WARD, HARD, AND IT'S SLOWING DOWN THE DECK. Phil: HEY, JACOB, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER  TO GO BACK WITH THE POT SO STEVE LEARNS  WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO. "WELL, YOU KNOW, STEVE WAS SLOW." WELL, YOU WORRY ABOUT JAKE, AND LET STEVE WORRY ABOUT STEVE. GOD. SCREAMING AT STEVE ABOUT THIS AND SCREAMING AT STEVE ABOUT THAT -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE TALK. MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE IT SOME MORE WATER. GRAB YOUR BROTHER AND COME TO THE WHEELHOUSE. ROGER. JAKE. THIS IS GONNA BE UGLY. IF I WOULD HAVE PULLED THAT STUNT THAT YOU JUST DID, I WOULD HAVE WALKED OFF THIS [BLEEP] DECK, AND I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU, "[BLEEP] YOU WANT TO STACK POTS "AND PUT CRAB ON, YOU DO IT BY YOURSELF. YOU CAN TAKE THIS DECK AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR [BLEEP]" THAT'S WHAT I'D DO. EVERYBODY ELSE IS UNLEASHING ON HIM. I SAID PLEASANTLY, "HEY, STEVE, HERE, I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND. I'LL GET IT IN THERE REAL QUICK." IT'S ABOUT TIME, YOU GUYS, TO WORK WITH THE GUY TO TRY TO IMPROVE IT. BUT WORK WITH THE GUY. I AM WORKING WITH HIM. IF HE GETS AN ATTITUDE AND WALKS OFF THIS BOAT, WE ARE [BLEEP] HE DIDN'T GET AN ATTITUDE, BUT ALL I ASKED, "WILL --" HOW DO YOU KNOW? DON'T YELL [BLEEP] WORK WITH THE GUY. AND JUST REMEMBER, YOU DON'T KNOW [BLEEP] I DON'T KNOW [BLEEP] ABOUT NOTHING. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DON'T. AND I DON'T CLAIM TO. DON'T THINK YOU'RE A [BLEEP] GIFTED DECKHAND, BUD, 'CAUSE I ASSURE YOU -- YOU'RE NOT. I'M NOT, EXCEPT FOR -- YOU'RE NOT. RIGHT NOW YOU DO NEED ME IN THIS OPERATION RIGHT NOW. ONE THING I DO GOT TO SAY IN JAKE'S DEFENSE -- RIGHT NOW IN THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW... UNTIL WE GET TO DUTCH HARBOR. [ LAUGHS ] WORK WITH THE GUY. TEACH HIM. HE'S GOOD. HE'S GOOD. HE'S DOING REALLY GOOD. AND DON'T THINK YOU'RE SOME GIFTED DECKHAND. I'M NOT. I'M NOT. YOU MIGHT BE OKAY, BUT YOU AIN'T NO GREAT YET. Narrator: IF THE CREW CAN'T FIND THEIR RHYTHM, AN ALREADY LONG SEASON COULD GET LONGER. Phil: HE'S LEARNING, AND HE'S GOOD AT IT. HE'LL GET IT. BUT YOU START SCREAMING AT SOMEBODY AND YOU GET THEM FLUSTERED, THEY'RE NEVER GONNA LEARN. AND WHEN IT COMES TO BEING A GREAT DECKHAND, I WAS A GREAT DECKHAND. THAT'S HOW I GOT TO RUN A BOAT. Narrator: 380 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE 115-FOOT TIME BANDIT IS A FEW MILES FROM THEIR NORTHERN STRINGS. AFTER HEDGING OVER HALF HIS GEAR ON MR. MAGOO, CAPTAIN ANDY STRUCK OUT. Andy: LAST YEAR, THERE WERE 750 CRAB HERE PER POT. THERE AIN'T NOTHING THERE THIS YEAR. I GOT JACK SQUAT. GOT ABOUT 10,000 POUNDS ON BOARD. WORST START I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. WE WENT 90 MILES IN 2 DAYS. Narrator: NOW WITH THREE DAYS TO PLUG THE BOAT, CAPTAIN ANDY IS PRAYING THAT HIS LAST SACRED FAMILY FISHING HOLE, AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS THE "BUTT CHEEKS," WILL PAY OFF. IT'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GONNA FIND THE MOTHER LODE. OH, WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE "BUTT CHEEK" TIME. WE'RE A LONG WAYS FROM LOADING THIS BOAT WITH CRAB. Man: FEEL THE PAIN. OH, YOU BOTH ARE PRETTY SAD. [ LAUGHS ] DO OR DIE. RIGHT THERE AT THE BUTT CHEEK. BOO-YAH! Narrator: DESPERATE TO CHANGE THEIR FORTUNE, THE SUPERSTITIOUS HILLSTRANDS DECIDE IT'S TIME TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR BAD JUJU. THE NORTHWESTERN STOLE MY BROTHER JOHN'S COAT. SO SINCE IT WAS JAKE ANDERSON THAT STOLE IT, WE MADE A LITTLE JAKE ANDERSON  NORTHWESTERN GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS BAD LUCK. HE WAS SITTING THERE WATCHING YOU. STARING AT ME. STARING AT THE BACK OF YOU. AND NOW HE'S GONNA GET A GOOD BURNING. Man: I THINK HE'S THE BAD LUCK FOR THIS TRIP, SO WE'RE GONNA BURN HIM AT THE STAKE. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE NORTHWESTERN. I LOVE THE SMELL OF LIGHTER FLUID IN THE MORNING. BURNING HIM. LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU! Man: WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE NORTHWESTERN. WE JUST CAN'T HAVE THAT JACKET ON OUR BOAT. BAD LUCK. WE'RE JUST GETTING RID OF THE BAD LUCK. BYE-BYE, COAT. HAPPY TRAILS TO YOU. I'M GLAD TO SEE WE'RE FINALLY PUTTING THIS TO REST. BURNING THE BAD LUCK, BROTHER. BYE-BYE, COAT. GET OUT OF HERE. Andy: WE FINALLY PUT THE JAKE PROBLEM TO REST. AND NOW IT'S DONE. I HAVE MY WEAPON. I'M READY TO DO BATTLE. Narrator: BAD JUJU, BEGONE. AND NO EXCUSES LEFT, ANDY'S HILLSTRAND REPUTATION IS NOW ON THE LINE. THIS IS THE DEEPEST WE'VE GONE ALL YEAR. [BLEEP] LET'S CATCH OUR CRABS AND GO HOME. I'M GONNA LISTEN TO THE BLOCK HERE. [ WINCH GRINDING ] I DON'T KNOW. MIGHT HAVE SOME WEIGHT TO IT. OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT POT. GOT CRAB LEGS, ANDY? WE GOT CRAB LEGS. WE GOT CRAB LEGS! JUST HOW MUCH WE GOT IS THE QUESTION. OH, YEAH, BABY! YEAH! OWW! AND WE GOT [BLEEP] HUGE [BLEEP] CRAB! HAH! HAH! WHOO-HOO! HAH! HAH!! HA HA! THAT'S [BLEEP] CRAB THERE, MY FRIEND. DUMP IT BACK. 21 HOURS. THAT LOOKS A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN FISHING ON. WE MIGHT MAKE IT. Narrator: A 21-HOUR SOAK, THREE-QUARTER-FULL POTS, A BOATLOAD OF GEAR, MONEY IN THE BANK. I LOVE IT. ALL ALONE IN THE BUTT CHEEKS -- WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR? UNBELIEVABLE. BIG [BLEEP] "BIG CRAB," HE SAYS. HA HA! YEAH! WE'RE SETTING BACK ON THAT, MY FRIEND -- HALF-FULL POT. 5-1-0! HA HA HA HA HA! 510, BROTHER. 510! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE GOING TO TOWN! DADDY'S GONNA TAKE US TO TOWN! THROW THAT HOOK. LOOK AT THAT. RIGHT THERE! BAM! BAM! OH, MAN, COME ON, BABY. WHOO! YOU GOT TO BELIEVE TO RECEIVE, BROTHER. WHOO! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH, BABY! YEAH! WHOO! HAH! YEAH! [BLEEP] THREE-QUARTERS FULL! YEAH! YEAH! TIME BANDIT'S BACK ON THE TEAM! WHOO-HOO! OH, CRAB-ALANCHE. CRAB-ALANCHE! SERIOUS [BLEEP] CRAB RIGHT THERE. NOW, HOW COME WE DIDN'T COME HERE FIRST? WHY DIDN'T WE COME HERE FIRST? WE JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE ON THE BAD END? OH, NICE. RUSSELL, GIVE IT TO ME. DANG IT! [ LAUGHS ] 655. Andy: 650 [BLEEP] CRAB. 655! 655, HE SAID! [ LAUGHS ] THIS WHOLE BOWL IS JUST LOADED WITH 600s, MAN. THIS WHOLE BOWL IS LOADED. I TOLD THEM, I THINK I HAD TO PULL A 530-SOMETHING AVERAGE TWICE TO GET 90,000 CRAB. WE'LL SEE. KNOCKING ON WOOD. [ KNOCKING ] Narrator: NOW CAPTAIN ANDY WILL CONCENTRATE ALL OF HIS GEAR ON THE GROUNDS. Narrator: 370 MILES FROM DUTCH HARBOR IS THE 125-FOOT NORTHWESTERN. CAPTAIN SIG IS ON THE CRAB, AVERAGING OVER 400 KEEPERS A POT. SO FAR FOR TODAY, I'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY MORE THAN HAPPY. WE'RE GETTING THE NUMBERS OUT OF THEM WE NEED. Narrator: AFTER A WEEK OF PROSPECTING, CAPTAIN SIG HAS FOUND GOOD FISHING JUST 55 MILES FROM THE ICE. AND IF YOU'RE DOING LIKE A 400-PLUS, AND ALL YOU'VE DONE IS JUST DUMP THEM IN THE WATER, THAT'S PUTTING CRAB ON THE BOAT FAST. THAT'S JUST ON A DAY'S SOAK, SO THAT'S GREAT. Man: THE WEATHER RIGHT NOW IS NOT SO NICE. Narrator: WITH HEAVY TIDES PULLING AGAINST THE BUOYS, CAPTAIN SIG IS FORCED TO HAUL IN THE DITCH. OUR STRING IS RIGHT IN THE DITCH, WHICH MEANS OUR STRING'S RIGHT HERE, AND THE SWELLS ARE COMING RIGHT INSIDE THE BOAT. NOW THE FIVE-MAN CREW IS COMPLETELY EXPOSED. EVERYBODY'S KIND OF ON THEIR TOES RIGHT NOW. BUT FOR THE NORTHWESTERN, THE GRIND AND WEATHER IS BUSINESS AS USUAL. DOUBLE OVERTIME. WHOA! LOST IT. WHOA! WHOA! WHAT THE [BLEEP] YEAH! THAT WAS HUGE! Narrator: OUT OF NOWHERE, A 40-FOOT WAVE CRASHES OVER THE PORT-SIDE SHELTER DECK, BARELY MISSING THE UNSUSPECTING CREW. ARE WE GOOD, OR IS SOMETHING TWEETING OUT THERE? IT'S NAUTICAL, IS WHAT THEY CALL IT RIGHT NOW. I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS COMING OVER THE OTHER SIDE. STOP MOVING AROUND SO MUCH. YOU'RE ROCKING THE BOAT. GOT A GOOD SHOT ON THAT ONE. [ LAUGHS ] YOU KNOW THEY'RE BIG WHEN YOU LOOK UP. THAT THING CAME UP PAST THE BREAK. GAME OVER. Narrator: THE FORCE OF THE 44,000 GALLONS OF WATER BLEW APART THE POT TIES, VIOLENTLY SHIFTING THE 800-POUND POTS ACROSS THE DECK. THAT'S A LOT WATER. IT SNAPPED THE POT TIES. IT'S FAIR TO SAY ABOUT 12,000 POUNDS JUST GOT SHIFTED ACROSS. ONE WAVE. IF IT WAS ME JUST STANDING BACK THERE, I'D BE LIKE A PINBALL. STUFF LIKE THAT WILL SNEAK UP ON YOU. I DON'T KNOW. YOU GET HOME, YOU FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS MISERY, YOU KNOW? YOU GET HOME AND GO, "OH, THE SEASON WASN'T SO BAD." Narrator: 20 MILES TO THE NORTH, THE CORNELIA MARIE IS 18 HOURS INTO THEIR DAY AND RACING TO FINISH THEIR FIRST STRING. Phil: WE'RE GETTING DONE WITH OUR SECOND STRING IN OUR NORTHERN AREA. CONSISTENT 300s, 350s ON A 14-HOUR SOAK. Narrator: CAPTAIN PHIL IS BACK, AND HE HASN'T LOST A STEP. FOR A SHORT SOAK, HE'S LANDING ON A LITTLE BIT OF CRAB. Narrator: THE SKIPPER HAS LANDED ON THE CRAB, BUT WITH WEATHER AND ICE BARRELING TOWARDS THE GROUNDS, PHIL HAS A JUDGMENT CALL TO MAKE. AND I GOT TO MAKE THE BIG DECISION OF WHETHER TO GAMBLE OR NOT -- STAY OUT HERE AND CONTINUE PUTTING CRAB ON THE BOAT AND PRAY LIKE HELL THAT WE GET A BREAK IN THE WEATHER TO DELIVER THIS CRAB OR JUST RUN TO ST. PAUL ISLAND AND PLAY IT SAFE. Narrator: IF HE WAITS TOO LONG, ICE COULD CHOKE OFF ST. PAUL HARBOR, LEAVING PHIL WITH A BOATLOAD OF CRAB AND NOWHERE TO GO. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET A BUNCH OF CRAB ON THIS BOAT, IF IT GOES WRONG AND THEY JUST DIE OR SOMETHING, THAT GOES AGAINST MY QUOTA, 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT A MILLION DOLLARS' WORTH OF CRAB. BOY, I'D BE IN DEEP [BLEEP] Narrator: WHILE THE SKIPPER WEIGHS HIS DECISION, ON DECK, THE FIVE-MAN CREW IS FINALLY BEGINNING TO JELL. WE'RE STARTING TO GET UP TO SPEED. THE RHYTHM IS COMING BACK. YEAH, I'M STARTING TO GET BETTER WITH THE -- YOU KNOW, THE SYSTEM. [ WINCH GRINDS ] THAT'S THE LAST POT. YOU'RE GONNA RUN ABOUT 20 MINUTES AND THEN SET THEM. SEEMED TODAY THAT LAST PART, EVERYTHING WENT REALLY WELL. GOT SOME CRAB. NO ONE GOT HURT. Phil: WELL, THE LINE POPPED OUT OF THE BLOCK, AND IT WAS REALLY SUPERTIGHT, AND IT CAUGHT JACOB. THE LINE WRAPPED AROUND HIS LEG AND DRUG HIM TO THE RAIL. Narrator: THE CREW RACES TO FREE JAKE'S ANKLE FROM THE BITE OF THE LINE, JUST BEFORE THE 800-POUND POT COULD HAVE PULLED HIM INTO THE 34-DEGREE WATER. I ALMOST GOT SUCKED OVERBOARD. IT SEIZED DOWN AND DROPPED HIM TO THE FLOOR AND [BLEEP] AND I CAME OUT WITH A KNIFE, WAS READY, BUT HIS BROTHER, DUDE, SAVED THE DAY. A LINE CIRCUIT PULLED THROUGH THE BLOCK, RIPPED HIM RIGHT OFF HIS FEET. SCARY, MAN. [BLEEP] GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB, JAKE. REAL GOOD, BUDDY. I FEEL LIKE DINNER'S GONNA TASTE A LITTLE BIT BETTER TONIGHT AFTER THAT, SO... Phil: THAT'S IT. IT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT EVERY TIME. THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU -- YOU NEVER [BLEEP] KNOW. BUT THAT'S WHY WE LOVE DOING THIS. WE LOVE LIVING ON THE EDGE. [BLEEP] THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT EVERY TIME. Narrator: AND FOR DEAR OLD DAD, WELL, WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU JUST MAKES YOU STRONGER. NO. WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S HAPPENED TO ME A HUNDRED TIMES. I BET HE WAS [BLEEP] HIS PANTS. Narrator: THE INCENTIVE IS IN THE LEAD, BUT CAPTAIN PHIL HAS FOUND THE CRAB. Narrator: AFTER A 20-HOUR STEAM, THE 155-FOOT WIZARD IS FINALLY PULLING IN TO PORT. HALF OF HER CREW IS BATTERED, BROKEN, AND IN NEED OF MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE WAVES WE TOOK TODAY KIND OF LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION ON OUR STACK AND HAVE BLOWN OUT THE DOORS. Narrator: EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING... EVERYBODY, HANG ON! HANG ON! FORGET ABOUT [BLEEP] TARP AND HANG ON. Narrator: WITHOUT WARNING, CAPTAIN KEITH CRASHED HEAD ON INTO A MASSIVE 40-FOOT WAVE. THE FORCE OF THE WAVE KNOCKED THE DECKHANDS OFF THEIR FEET, SLAMMING THEIR BODIES INTO THE 1-INCH THICK STEEL DOORS, BENDING THE FRAMES FROM THE IMPACT. GRAB THAT LINE! HAULED ABSOLUTELY NO CRAB AND ARE BACK IN TOWN ABOUT 32 HOURS LATER. PROBABLY THE WORST FISHING TRIP EVER. YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER'S GOT SOME -- MY BROTHER'S GOT SOME BUSTED-UP RIBS, IS WHAT IT IS. SO WE'RE GONNA SEE WHAT WE GOT TO DO TO GET HIM MOVED, AND WHATEVER IT TAKES, WE'RE GONNA GET HIM OFF HERE AND GET HIM TO THE CLINIC. NOW WE HAVE TO GET MONTE OFF THE BOAT. HOPE HE'S NOT TOO BANGED UP. I'M FEELING HIS OPIE SEASON COMING TO A QUICK CONCLUSION, THOUGH, WHICH IS REALLY GONNA BE SOME MAJOR SHOES TO FILL. Keith: ON THE BOUNCE, WE'RE COMING IN.
