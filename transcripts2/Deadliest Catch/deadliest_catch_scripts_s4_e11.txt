 Man: SEAS 25 FEET. ...AND IS NOW ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE OPILIO GROUNDS. AS SKIPPERS PREPARE FOR THE ONSLAUGHT, BACK IN DUTCH, MECHANICAL REPAIRS HAVE PUT THE CORNELIA MARIE FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE. I ABOUT BLEW A GASKET YESTERDAY. I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA HAVE A [BLEEP] HEART ATTACK. Narrator: THE SECOND BAND-AID TO HIS ENGINE HAS NOW PUT PHIL NEARLY $60,000 IN THE HOLE. JUST FIX THE [BLEEP] THING. Phil: SO, WE PUT A BAND-AID ON IT. HE THINKS IT'LL WORK FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON, AND, HOPEFULLY, WE FIXED IT, AND IT SEEMS TO BE RUNNING FINE RIGHT NOW -- KNOCK ON WOOD. NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAD BACK OUT. HURRICANE'S READY TO ROCK. HERE IN LIKE A DAY, WE'LL BE HAULING SOME FATTY POTS, LIKE FILL THIS PUPPY UP. IT'S GONNA GET COLD, BUT, HOPEFULLY, WE CAN GET SOME CRAB ON BEFORE IT DOES. HERE'S ROUND TWO, RIGHT HERE. IT'S BLOWING ABOUT 50 OUT, BUT WE'RE GONNA LEAVE ANYWAY. Narrator: WITH MORE THAN 70,000 POUNDS LEFT TO CATCH FOR HIS FIRST DELIVERY, PHIL MUST GET BACK TO THE GROUNDS AND ON THE CRAB FAST. DOWN ON DECK, PER CAPTAIN'S ORDERS, THE ENTIRE CREW HUSTLES TO GET AHEAD ON BAIT SETUPS... ...EVERYONE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JAKE, PHIL'S YOUNGEST SON. [ SIGHS ] OH, YEAH. Narrator: SINCE LAST OCTOBER'S KING SEASON, NOT ONLY HAS JAKE BEEN FEELING HIS OATS... AW, JAKE! I OUGHT TO FIRE HIS [BLEEP] RIGHT NOW. YOU LAME ASS. Narrator: ...HE'S BEEN WHITTLING AWAY AT HIS DAD'S JANGLED NERVES. WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT? I'M GONNA PULL THE BOSS CARD THIS TIME. NOW YOU KNOW WHY LIONS EAT THEIR YOUNG. Narrator: AND WITH SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY ALREADY LOST THIS SEASON, HIS DAD IS GOING TO NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK IN ORDER TO PULL OFF A COMEBACK. Phil: 'CAUSE WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I HOPE WE GO OUT AND SMACK 'EM DEAD. THAT'S THE PLAN. WE NEED A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT AFTER ALL THIS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FISH HARD. SO, THAT'S FINE. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. Narrator: AS THE HURRICANE BEGINS COVERING THE GROUNDS, PHIL THROTTLES HIS TWIN 630-HORSEPOWER ENGINES TO FULL POWER, DRIVING THE CORNELIA MARIE INTO THE DARK, UNCERTAIN SEAS. Phil: IT'S [BLEEP] OUT. SEAS ARE BUILDING. YOU CAN'T SEE A DAMN THING. Narrator: FISHING 295 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST, WIZARD CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN HAS SPENT THE LAST 15 HOURS GRINDING THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE HURRICANE. AND AS THE WEATHER RAPIDLY DETERIORATES, IT'S EITHER WORK OR TUCK TAIL AND RUN. YEAH, THIS WEATHER'S GOING TO CRAP ON US NOW. BUT IT'S COMING OUT OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST DIRECTION POSSIBLE. I HAVEN'T SEEN AN OPENING TRIP LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME. WHOA. Man: IT'S COMING UP, GETTING A LITTLE NASTY. THEY'RE CALLING FOR NAUTICAL AGAIN. THAT'S 50-MILE-AN-HOUR. DON'T GET ME WORKED UP, OKAY? Narrator: AFTER LAST NIGHT'S MOTIVATIONAL CHAT... PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN SO FAR IS A "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN" CREW FISHING ON A "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN BOAT." ...AND AFTER RALLYING FOR 24 STRAIGHT HOURS, THE WIZARD CREW HAS FINALLY UNITED. Colburn: I'M GONNA PUT IT ON A PRETTY SLOPPY COURSE. IT'S GONNA BE RIGHT IN THE DITCH ON THE STARBOARD SIDE. GLAD I'M NOT THROWING THE SHOTS RIGHT NOW. Colburn: IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN BLASTED BACK TO BACK TO BACK WITH BIG-TIME BLOWS LIKE THIS. GOT IT! WHEN IT STARTS REALLY SCREAMING, I MEAN, THE WAVES STACK UP, THEY'VE JUST GOT THESE BIG, NASTY, GREEN TEETH, AND ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST KEEP FROM GETTING BIT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA COME, WHEN THAT WAVE IS THAT'S GONNA TAKE OUT THE BOW AND JUST COME FLYING DOWN THE DECK AND CLEAR THE WHOLE DECK. JUST A COUPLE MORE, GUYS. TWO MORE. TWO MORE, OKAY? Narrator: KEITH DECIDES TO STOP HAULING. GET 'EM OFF. GET 'EM OFF. GET TO THE NEXT STRING AND SEE IF WE CAN HAUL IT. Narrator: EVEN WITH BIG NUMBERS COMING ABOARD, CONDITIONS ON DECK ARE BECOMING TOO DANGEROUS TO FISH. BUT I'M GONNA MOVE THE BOAT AND GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE THAT NEXT BLOW SHOWS UP. WE'RE ALWAYS RACING THE CLOCK OUT HERE. TIME TO GO GET DRY. YEAH, YOU GUYS, STACK UP IT UP, SECURE EVERYTHING, AND GET OFF DECK AS QUICK AS YOU CAN, ALL RIGHT? Narrator: BUT BEFORE THE MEN CAN CLEAR THE DECK... WHOO! WHOO! HO! [ LAUGHS ] THAT WAS COOL. I SEEN THAT THING [BLEEP] WALL COMING, AND I COME DUCKING BEHIND THIS THING. THAT WAS INTERESTING. Colburn:  HEADS UP! HEADS UP! Narrator: ...EXPERIENCED DECKHAND LENNY LEKANOFF GRABS ONTO THE STEEL COILER AS NEARLY 11 TONS OF WATER CRASHES OVER THE DECK. BOY, THAT WAS SPOOKY! [ LAUGHS ] THAT WAS SPOOKY! I NEVER RAN FROM A WAVE BEFORE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS COMING THIS WAY. WELL, I WAS HOLDING ONTO IT. DON'T GOT TO TELL ME TWICE. I'M OUT OF HERE! IT'S A GOOD THING LENNY WAS OVER THERE, BECAUSE HE SAW IT RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME I WAS YELLING AT HIM, AND HE GOT OUT OF THE WAY QUICK. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST LUCKY THERE WAS ONLY ONE GUY OVER AT THE RAIL 'CAUSE IF WE WOULD HAVE HAD A GREENHORN OVER THERE CLEARING CRAB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY IN TIME. RIGHT NOW, THE BERING SEA'S DEFINITELY LOOKING LIKE IT'S HAVING ONE OF THOSE YEARS. I HAD A WEIRD PREMONITION COMING INTO THIS SEASON, TOO. Narrator: COMING UP, 5 POUNDS OF STEEL SLAPS A SKIPPER. Man: IF YOU'RE NOT BLEEDING, YOU'RE NOT WORKING! Narrator: AND 1,000 POUNDS OF STEEL TRAPS A GREENHORN. HEY! WATCH OUT! Narrator: JUST SOUTH OF THE STORM, 285 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTHWESTERN CREW HAS BEEN WORKING FOR 24 HOURS, GRINDING THROUGH NEARLY 200 POTS WITHOUT A BREAK. I'M GONNA BE SLEEPING STANDING UP SORTING CRAB HERE IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES -- I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH. SIG CAN RUN THIS BOAT SLEEPING, STANDING UP. AND OBVIOUSLY, HE IS, AT 20 KNOTS RIGHT NOW. Sig: RIGHT NOW, WE'VE BEEN UP FOR 24 HOURS, TRYING TO GET THROUGH OUR POTS. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S SNOWING, AND I MEAN IT'S SNOWING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE PAST THE BOW. AND IF YOU'RE NOT RIGHT ON THE BAG, YOU WON'T SEE THE POT. YOU WILL NOT FIND THEM. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW, MAN, THAT YOU GET IT FROM ALL ANGLES AROUND HERE. IT NEVER FAILS. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER THING THAT YOU KIND OF HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! Sig:  500, 600 CRAB THERE? Man: THIS ONE'S GOING IN THE BOOKS -- THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY. [ LAUGHS ] WE'RE TOPPING OFF THE TANK. IT'S GETTING REAL CLOSE. I CAN TELL YOU ONE POSITIVE THING, BOYS -- THERE'S ONLY 20 POTS IN THIS STRING. Narrator: THE DOGGED CREW'S IN THE HOMESTRETCH WHEN A CALL COMES IN FROM THE PROCESSOR. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] YEAH? YEAH, RIGHT. THAT'S NEWS. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO YOU GUYS LATER. THE PROCESSING FACILITY BASICALLY BUMPED UP OUR DATE BY TWO DAYS, AND THEY ALSO BUMPED UP WHAT THEY WANTED US TO BRING IN. NOW IT'S LOOKING LIKE WE GOT TO PULL ANOTHER ALL-NIGHTER AND INTO THE DAY SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS BOAT FULL. Narrator: CAPTAIN SIG GOES OVER THE HAILER WITH THE BAD NEWS. THIS IS [BLEEP] I KIND OF PROMISED THE GUYS I WOULDN'T DO IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, HERE WE ARE, VAMPIRES AGAIN. ANOTHER ALL-NIGHTER. HE SAID HE WASN'T GONNA DO THIS AFTER THE FIRST NIGHT. HERE WE ARE AGAIN. Narrator: IT'LL BE ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT FOR THE CREW, WHO ARE ALREADY WALKING ZOMBIES. THE GUYS ARE JUST GONNA HAVE TO SUCK IT UP AND DO IT. THAT WAS MY HAPPY PLACE. NOW I GOT NOTHING. [ YAWNING ] OH, YEAH! KEEP 'EM COMING. HEY! WATCH OUT! COME ON, GO. GET OUT OF THERE. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] YOU OKAY? Narrator: THE CREW FREES JAKE BEFORE HE'S CRUSHED BY THE 1,000-POUND STEEL POT. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'LL RAISE THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK. FATIGUED DECKHANDS MAKE A POTENTIALLY DEADLY MISTAKE. THE POT WAS LEFT ON THE LAUNCHER WITHOUT THE DOGS TIGHTLY SECURED. [BLEEP] HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE IN A HURRY, MAN. HAD THERE BEEN ANY MORE ROLL, I WOULD HAVE BEEN TOAST. WHOO-HOO. Narrator: AFTER SHAKING OFF A POTENTIALLY FATAL ACCIDENT, THE CREW GETS BACK TO BUSINESS. IN HEAVY SEAS 105 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, TIME BANDIT CAPTAIN ANDY HILLSTRAND IS ON A HOT STREAK AND JUST 35,000 POUNDS SHY OF HIS FIRST DELIVERY. WE'RE UP TO PULL THE LAST POTS TO PLUG THE BOAT, AND THE GUYS ARE HAVING BETS FROM 11 TO 25 POTS IS WHAT THEY'RE FIGURING TO TOTALLY PLUG OUR BOAT HERE. I WANT TO SEE MY BROTHER PULLING FULL POTS, 'CAUSE I'M PULLING FULL POTS, AND THEN WE'RE GOING IN QUICKER. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE. I MIGHT EVEN GO OUT ON DECK TODAY AND GIVE THEM A HAND. Andy: THE WEATHER'S COMING UP, EASTERLY 45 ALREADY. BUT THE WAVES AREN'T CAUGHT UP YET, SO IT'S GONNA GET ROUGH, AND IT'S GONNA GET ROUGH FAST. Neal: JUST WAITING FOR HIM TO COME OUT AND SEE WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH, ENJOY A LITTLE PUNISHMENT LIKE US, SEE WHAT THEIR LITTLE BROTHER HAS TO GO THROUGH. FREEZING OUT HERE! IT'S COLDER THAN FREEZING OUT HERE! THESE WINDS HERE ARE GONNA [BLEEP] QUADRUPLE. IT'S GONNA BE 80, 90 KNOTS -- I JUST KNOW IT. YOU WATCH. STAND BY FOR A WEATHER UPDATE IN ABOUT AN HOUR. IT'S GONNA BE BLOWING 20 KNOTS. IT'S GONNA BE TWICE AS HARD TO PULL GEAR, TWICE AS HARD TO SORT CRAB, TWICE AS HARD JUST TO STAND OUT HERE. Narrator: ALTHOUGH BIG BROTHER JOHNATHAN HAS ONLY HIT THE DECK A FEW TIMES THIS SEASON, FOR THE CREW, IT'S A WELCOME SIGHT AND A CHANCE TO GET A FEW DIGS IN. CAPTAIN JOHN'S A GREAT DECKHAND. IT'S JUST BEEN A WHILE SINCE HE'S DONE IT. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE! HE'S SHOWING THE BOYS HOW TO DO IT. YEAH! NICE. Narrator: JOHNATHAN'S EXTRA MUSCLE IS NEEDED, AS EACH POT CLEARING THE RAIL IS STUFFED WITH KEEPERS. [ GRUNTING ] I HAVEN'T WORKED WITH JOHN HILLSTRAND ON DECK SINCE '91. A LONG TIME AGO. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. IT'LL ALL COME BACK TO HIM. HE SAYS HE'S GONNA STAY UNTIL THEIR BOAT'S FULL, BUT I'M THINKING HE'S ONLY GONNA STAY FOR FOUR POTS. BUT HE'S GONNA BEAT THAT, IT LOOKS LIKE. EIGHT POTS. [ CHEERING AND LAUGHTER ] MY BROTHER! YEAH! Andy: YEAH, BROTHER! YEAH, BROTHER! FULL POT. WHOO! WELL, I THINK YOUR MISERY'S ABOUT OVER, 'CAUSE WE'RE ALREADY STUFFING THAT TANK. [ LAUGHS ] THIS TANK IS FILLING UP RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. I WAS ON DECK FOR 11 YEARS -- ACTUALLY SINCE I WAS LIKE 5 AND ABOUT THIS BIG. CAPTAIN USA! I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM. I DON'T WANT HIM TO HURT HIMSELF OVER THERE. ONE SHOT -- ONE KILL, BABY! YEAH! WANT TO HELP HIM LAND THAT? AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. RIGHT ON, BRO. AHH! THIS IS THE GREATEST TIME OF ANYBODY'S LIFE IS RIGHT BEFORE THE BOAT GETS LOADED. HE DID PRETTY GOOD. I WAS IMPRESSED. I WAS. IT'S UNDERNEATH THE BOAT. DIVE ON IT! THROW IT! [ CLANKING ] Narrator: JOHNATHAN'S UNDERARM THROW MISSES THE BUOY BAG, BUT THE 5-POUND HOOK LANDS SQUARE ON THE FACE. [BLEEP] I JUST GOT [BLEEP] I JUST WOUNDED MYSELF BAD. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP] HIT MYSELF IN THE [BLEEP] NOSE. CAPTAIN DOWN! [ LAUGHTER ] HE MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO TOWN TO GET SOME STITCHES. [ LAUGHS ] IS IT BAD? NO! HELL, NO! YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT! IF YOU'RE NOT BLEEDING, YOU'RE NOT WORKING. IS IT THAT BAD? YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN HE GOES OUT? I THINK IT'S ALREADY FROZE. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: JOHNATHAN TOUGHS IT OUT FOR ONE MORE POT BEFORE HEADING IN FOR DAMAGE CONTROL. WATCH THIS POT NOW. YEAH, I BETTER GO SEE WHAT THE DAMAGE IS. SEE WHAT THE DAMAGES ARE. I'M GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT. [ MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ] NORMAL DECKHAND WALKS OFF DECK LIKE THAT, HE'S FIRED. NOT IF YOU'RE THE OWNER. FIRED! FIRED! GET OFF MY DECK! [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T THINK JOHNATHAN'S COMING BACK OUT TILL HE GETS STITCHED UP. Narrator: COMING UP, A FATHER HITS WHERE IT HURTS. YOU DO THAT ONE MORE TIME, I SWEAR TO [BLEEP] I'LL TAKE HALF A PERCENT FROM YOU. AND LATER... MISERABLE. HE'S GOT ONE STYLE -- "KEEP GOING TILL THE BOAT'S FULL." [ SONAR PINGS ] Narrator: 340 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, AS TIME BANDIT CAPTAIN ANDY HILLSTRAND COMES CLOSER TO STUFFING HIS TANKS... [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ...DOWN ON DECK, BIG BROTHER JOHNATHAN IS SUFFERING A BRUISED EGO WITH A BROKEN FACE. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] I TOLD YOU NOT TO BRING ME OUT HERE. I [BLEEP] MYSELF UP BAD. Man: IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM COMING OUT HERE AND HURTING HIMSELF. LOOK WHAT HE DID. HE GOES AND BANGS UP HIS NOSE LIKE THAT. [BLEEP] ALL RIGHT, I QUIT! WHO BET AGAINST ME? WHO BET AGAINST ME? [ LAUGHTER ] WHO BET AGAINST ME? I SENT HIM OUT THERE FOR 11 POTS, AND HE BUSTS HIS NOSE OPEN. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DAMAGE YET. SEE WHAT THE DAMAGES ARE. I'M GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT. [ MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ] NO, I DON'T THINK JOHNATHAN'S COMING BACK OUT TILL HE GETS STITCHED UP. WHAT DID YOU DO? John: THREW THE OL' "UNDERARM UNDER THE BLOCK" TRICK, UNDERARM WITH THE HOOK UNDER THE BLOCK. OH. JUST SMASHED MY FACE, DUDE, FROM HERE TO HERE. OHH. OHH! OHH, A GRAPPLE HOOK? I JUST WOUNDED MYSELF BAD. [BLEEP] MY [BLEEP] MOUTH HURTS. MY HEAD HURTS. OH, YOU BETTER COME IN, DUDE. [BLEEP] YEAH. HEY, I'M PULLING HIM. [ LAUGHS ] I'M PULLING HIM OFF THE TEAM THERE. HE NEEDS TO CLEAN THAT UP. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT TO TAKE A SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE, MAN. TAKE FOUR ADVIL RIGHT AWAY. [ LAUGHS ] MY WHOLE HEAD HURTS. I GUESS MY THROWING HOOK GOT HIM. IT'S THE TIME BANDIT -- 1. JOHNATHAN -- ZERO. YEAH, JUST CARRY ON LIKE JUST HE'S NOT THERE. WE'LL SEE IF HE COMES BACK OUT. THAT AIN'T BAD. [ CHUCKLES ] JUST A LITTLE CUT. AH, DUDE, THE SKIN'S STILL HOT. IT'S JUST RIGHT THERE. GOOD. IT'S MORE OF A CRUSH. MORE OF A CRUSH? [ LAUGHS ] MORE OF A SMASH. OH, YEAH. IT SKINNED YOU GOOD, YEAH. IT HIT ME SO HARD -- YOU GOT A CUT UP HERE, AND YOU GOT A CUT THERE, THOUGH. IT'S NOT SO BAD. IT HURTS. IT'S A GOOD ONE. I MEAN, THIS -- I CAN TAKE A GOOD PUNCH IN THE FACE, BUT I LIKE TO GIVE THEM BACK, TOO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO THE STEEL OUT THERE. [BLEEP] KICKED MY ASS. THIS IS A 3/4-INCH PIECE OF PIPE WITH FOUR HOOKS ON IT THAT'LL TAKE YOUR EYE OUT. [BLEEP] GOING BACK OUT FOR ONE MORE, THEN I'M GONNA DO SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION. MY LITTLE BABY FACE. [ LAUGHS ] A FACE ONLY A MOTHER COULD LOVE. A FACE ONLY OUR MOM LOVES! GOES OUT TO DO THE OLD "UNDER THE BLOCK" TRICK, BA-BAM! [ WHIMPERING ] OKAY, I'M GOING BACK OUT NOW! HEY! WE'RE GONNA PLUG THE BACK TANK RIGHT NOW. GUESS WHO'S BACK. AHH! CAPTAIN ON DECK. AND I'M GONNA FINISH THIS [BLEEP] STRING. THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA [BLEEP] DO. [ SEAGULLS CAWING ] PULLED THE LAST OF OUR POTS, PLUGGED THIS BOAT. THE WEATHER'S COME UP. THE EASTERLY -- 40 KNOTS RIGHT NOW. I'M GETTING BLOWN OFF OF HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: JOHNATHAN'S HIT THE DECK JUST IN TIME. WITH A HURRICANE FORECAST TO SLAM THE GROUNDS WITHIN THE HOUR, ANDY NEEDS TO TEAR THROUGH HIS GEAR, AND HE'LL NEED A STRONG MAN AT THE RAIL. THAT IS A HEAVY SON  OF A [BLEEP] THOSE ARE SOME HEAVY CRAB  THERE. GO BACK AND FORTH HERE AT THE END FROM TANK TO TANK TO LET THEM SETTLE A LITTLE BIT. WE CAN GET SOME MORE IN THEM BEFORE WE GO TO TOWN. WE'RE GETTING THESE TANKS PRETTY FULL HERE. TRICKLE THEM IN. Narrator: ANDY IS ON THE CRAB. EACH POT IS AVERAGING 750 KEEPERS. THIS ONE WE'RE GONNA STRUGGLE WITH. FOR THE DECKHANDS, THAT'S ANOTHER 1,200 BUCKS IN THEIR POCKETS. THIS ONE WE'RE GONNA STRUGGLE WITH. WE'RE FULL. YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] HUH? DROP IT! YEAH. Man: THE TANKS ARE STUFFED. GET 'EM LOADED, HEAD TO TOWN. Narrator: THE GOOD NEWS -- THE TIME BANDIT'S HOLDS ARE PLUGGED WITH OPILIO GOLD. THE BAD NEWS -- A GROWING HURRICANE STANDS BETWEEN ANDY AND ST. PAUL ISLAND. IF IT BLOWS UP EASTERLY, 55, 70 LIKE THEY SAY, AND 28- TO 40-FOOT SEAS -- BAD NEWS. IT'LL TAKE US 10 HOURS TO GO 35 MILES IF THE WEATHER GETS THAT BAD. 'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO POUND OUR CRAB INTO THE WEATHER AND KILL ALL OF OUR CRAB ALSO. OH, YEAH. IT'S GOTTEN SERIOUS FAST. Narrator: UP NEXT, A HARRIS SHOWDOWN. YOU WANT A FULL SHARE, YOU GET YOUR ASS ON OUTSIDE AND HELP THEM [BLEEP] AND I'M TALKING RIGHT NOW. [BLEEP] YOU GETTING DRY. GET YOUR ASS OUTSIDE AND EARN YOUR [BLEEP] MONEY. GOT IT? WAS THAT PLAIN ENOUGH? Narrator: 240 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, CORNELIA MARIE CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS IS FINALLY BACK TO HIS GROUNDS. HE'S HAULING TEST POTS, BUT FIGHTING WEATHER JUST TO FIND HIS GEAR. WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, IF YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING THE BOW, LET ALONE A POT THAT'S A QUARTER OF A MILE IN FRONT OF YOU. [ SIGHS ] Narrator: THE CREW, FRESH FROM A THREE-DAY BREAK, HAVE BEEN HAULING POTS STUFFED WITH 600 KEEPERS. WHOO! WHOA-HO-HO! YEAH, A BIG ONE! WHOO! THERE AIN'T NO STOP, MAN. ONCE YOU START, YOU DON'T STOP. WHEN YOU GUYS GET THE BAIT DONE, I'M GONNA TURN AROUND... Narrator: ON A QUICK RUN BETWEEN STRINGS, THE ENTIRE CREW BEGINS TENDING TO BAIT. WE'RE ABOUT TO SET THIS IN A COUPLE MINUTES, SO I GOT TO BE FAST. Narrator: BUT PHIL NOTICES HIS YOUNGEST SON IS MISSING...AGAIN. Phil: JAKE -- HE'S THE LAST GUY ON DECK AND THE FIRST ONE TO LEAVE. I WAS ALWAYS THE LAST GUY OFF DECK AND THE FIRST GUY ON DECK. PISSES ME OFF, YOU KNOW? [BLEEP] KID, IF YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING, DO IT RIGHT. JAKE LOOKS AT LIFE LIKE A PARTY, YOU KNOW? EVERYBODY'S LAUGHING AND JOKING, AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A SERIOUS BONE IN HIS BODY. JACOB, CALL ME ON THE PHONE. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HERE'S THE -- YOU WITH ME? YOU WANT A FULL SHARE, YOU GET YOUR ASS ON OUTSIDE AND HELP THEM [BLEEP] AND I'M TALKING RIGHT NOW. [BLEEP] YOU GETTING DRY. GET YOUR ASS OUTSIDE AND EARN YOUR [BLEEP] MONEY. GOT IT? WAS THAT PLAIN ENOUGH? BOY, JAKE'S ALL OVER IT. HE WANTS TO GET FULL SHARE. HE WANTS TO GET FULL SHARE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO A [BLEEP] THING TO EARN IT, AND IT PISSES ME OFF. GOD, THAT KID CAN GET MY BLOOD PRESSURE UP LIKE NO OTHER. AND HE'S GONNA DO IT MY WAY OR HE'S GONNA HIT THE [BLEEP] HIGHWAY. THAT'S THE BOTTOM [BLEEP] LINE IN THIS DEAL. Narrator: BUT BEFORE HITTING DECK, JAKE TAKES A DETOUR TO THE WHEELHOUSE. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? YOU NEEDED TO RUN IN? NO. HUH? YOU'RE THE ONE THAT WANTS TO BE FULL SHARE, JAKE! YOU'RE THE ONE THAT PISSES AND MOANS, BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK FOR IT. YOU DO THAT ONE MORE TIME, I SWEAR TO [BLEEP] I'LL TAKE HALF A PERCENT FROM YOU. OKAY. YOU DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. I'LL DO WHAT I NEED TO DO. SHOULD I BE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE? YOU SHOULDN'T. YOU SHOULDN'T. NOT AT ALL. 'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF I GOT TO PAY YOU THE SAME MONEY AS FREDDIE, I WANT THE SAME JOB AS FREDDIE. OKAY. YOU KNOW? HE'S THE FIRST ONE ON DECK EVERY DAY. I DIDN'T REALIZE, YOU KNOW, LIKE -- I'M SORRY I -- YOU DON'T EVER HELP YOUR BROTHER WITH BAIT. FREDDIE DOES. I DON'T EVER? JOSH DIDN'T EVEN BAIT UP THE WHOLE ENTIRE SET IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE STASH OF GEAR. WHO DID IT? IT WAS DAVE AND I AND FREDDIE. RIGHT, 'CAUSE [BLEEP] DOING SOMETHING ELSE. HE WAS SITTING UP HERE [BLEEP] WITH YOU. NO, HE WASN'T [BLEEP] WITH ME. I WAS IN BED. AND THEN WE DID ALL OF HIS BAIT TODAY BEFORE HE GOT OUT. WE DID ALL OF IT. I WATCHED IT. YOU WERE THE FOURTH GUY ON DECK. I WATCHED TODAY. DON'T TELL ME WHAT I KNOW. DON'T EVEN TALK! JUST SHUT UP! YOU PULL IT ONE MORE TIME, I'M GONNA DOCK YOU. OKAY. I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT BACK DOWN. THAT'S SO SWEET. OKAY. BE A FULL-SHARE GUY. I WILL. I WILL. I WILL. GOOD. DO IT. THANK YOU FOR AMPING ME UP FOR IT, YOU KNOW? JUST DO IT. I WILL. I WILL. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SQUAWKS ABOUT IT. JUST DO IT. I WILL. OKAY? YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE A COUPLE BREATHS. I AM, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR WHEN THE OTHER GUYS ARE COLD AND WET AND TIRED. I DON'T THINK IT WAS FAIR EITHER. I DIDN'T LIKE THAT EITHER. I DON'T LIKE THE SITUATION JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DON'T. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THAT HAPPENED. SO, JUST TAKE A COUPLE DEEP BREATHS. IT'S REALLY [BLEEP] SEASON RIGHT NOW TO BE GETTING RALLIED UP ABOUT THE SMALL [BLEEP] GET OUT OF HERE. I'M RALLIED UP. I WANT IT TO BE FAIR. I WANT IT TO BE FAIR, TOO. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S BEEN PISSING AND MOANING ABOUT IT. [BLEEP] FAIR. THIS IS A GOOD CAPTAIN RIGHT HERE. THEN [BLEEP] GO MAKE IT FAIR. GET OUT OF HERE. WHAT? GO MAKE IT FAIR. GO HELP THEM. YEAH. LATER, TODD. JUST REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU. JUST REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU. PAYING A 22-YEAR-OLD KID $80,000 A YEAR FOR WHATEVER HE DOES AIN'T ASKING A WHOLE LOT. IN FACT, HE'S MAKING MORE THAN THAT. THE LITTLE BASTARD'S MAKING ABOUT 100 GRAND. I'M PAYING HIM TOO MUCH MONEY. Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH"... WHEN THEY GOT HURRICANE WARNINGS OUT AROUND HERE, THEY'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR ASS KICKED. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYBODY FISH IN 100-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS AND 48-FOOT SEAS? YOU'RE ABOUT TO. Narrator: 250 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, CORNELIA MARIE CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS IS PLAYING A GOOD GAME OF CATCH-UP, PUTTING NEARLY 30,000 POUNDS ON THROUGH THE NIGHT. BUT NOW HE'S ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE HURRICANE. IT'S GONNA COME NORTHEAST, BUT WHEN YOU GET DOWN NEAR THIS EDGE, THE CURRENT RUNNING ONE WAY AGAINST THE WIND CREATES GREAT, BIG SEAS. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND THERE WHEN THAT HAPPENS. WHATEVER I DO, I WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE PURPLE. THE WAVES GET SO BIG AND SHARP THAT THEY OVERTAKE YOU. YOU'LL GO UP ON ONE THAT MIGHT BE 100 FEET TALL, AND IT'S BREAKING, AND IT KNOCKS THE LIGHTS ALL TO HELL AND TAKES EVERYTHING OFF THE ROOF, AND IT JUST MAKES A HELL OF A MESS. Narrator: PHIL'S BEEN SHROUDED IN A CLOUD OF BAD LUCK SINCE OPIES BEGAN, AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. PHIL'S FACING 40-FOOT SEAS, 100-KNOT WINDS, AND A DELIVERY IN JUST 48 HOURS. Phil: LIKE I SAID, IF WE GET THIS STRING HAULED, I'D FEEL FORTUNATE. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYBODY FISH IN 100-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS AND 48-FOOT SEAS? YOU'RE ABOUT TO. I THINK THE SEAS ARE STARTING TO BUILD A LITTLE BIT. WHEN THEY GOT HURRICANE WARNINGS OUT AROUND HERE, THEY'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR ASS KICKED. WHOA! WELL, I'LL TELL YOU THIS FLAT-OUT -- MOTHER NATURE ALWAYS WINS. [ LAUGHS ] COMING UP IN JUST A LITTLE BIT, GUYS. WHOO! HOW'S THAT ONE? Narrator: SO FAR, PHIL'S STRING IS AVERAGING 800 KEEPERS A POT. AFTER AN HOUR OF SLOSHING THROUGH THE GEAR, THE HEART OF THE STORM HITS. Phil: HOLY [BLEEP] LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THESE [BLEEP] IT'S REALLY COME UP NOW. Narrator: WINDS HOWL OVER 70 KNOTS. [BLEEP] Narrator: WITHIN MINUTES, THE SEAS BEGIN PUSHING 40 FEET. Phil: MURRAY,  JUST GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER. WE GOT TO THESE [BLEEP]  OFF THE BOAT NOW. AS THE WEATHER RAPIDLY DETERIORATES, PHIL ORDERS THE CREW TO CLEAR THE DECK OF ALL REMAINING POTS. Phil: WELL, LET'S TRY AND HOLD HER TOGETHER UNTIL WE CAN GET THIS [BLEEP] OFF THE BOAT. HE'S 8 MILES SHORT OF HIS COVETED GROUNDS, BUT NOW HE'S NOT ABOUT TO TEST HIS STABILITY REPORT. IN ANOTHER HOUR, THESE [BLEEP] MIGHT BE 50 FEET TALL. [ METAL CREAKING ] IT'S [BLEEP] IT'S PROBABLY BLOWING 60, 70. THE SEAS ARE BUILDING. IT'S SNOWING LIKE A BASTARD. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE SURFING. CAN'T SEE A DAMN THING. COME ON IN. IT'S TOO [BLEEP] ROUGH, MAN. IT'S A WRAP. 25 HOURS INTO IT, A TANK DOWN. [BLEEP] GONNA CATCH A LITTLE SNOOZE TIME. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT TILL IT COMES DOWN. IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO [BLEEP] OUT. Narrator: AS WINDS EXCEED 80 KNOTS AND SEAS CONTINUE TO BUILD... WE CAN DO 60, BUT WE CAN'T DO 80. Narrator: ...PHIL TURNS THE BOAT AROUND AND RUNS FOR COVER. THE NORTHWESTERN LEADS THE FLEET WITH 165,000 POUNDS OF CRAB. Narrator: SOUTH OF THE HURRICANE, 290 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTHWESTERN IS PLOWING THROUGH THE PRE-DAWN HOURS. CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN HAS LANDED HIS GEAR ON A HEAVY OPILIO BIOMASS, AND FOR THE LAST 38 HOURS, THE CREW HAS BEEN PULLING CONSISTENT 600s AND 700s. WHOO-HOO-HOO! IF THE FISHING KEEPS GOING THE WAY IT'S BEEN GOING, I FIGURE IF WE PULL THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE STRINGS, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FILL THE BOAT OR GET WHAT WE NEED. SO, WE'RE GONNA START IN THIS MORNING AND... SEE IF WE CAN'T FILL THAT TANK. OHH! SIG -- HE'S GOT ONE STYLE. THAT IS "KEEP GOING TILL THE BOAT'S FULL." Narrator: BUT IF THEY CAN PLUG ALL THREE HOLES IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS, THEY'LL HAVE A FULL DAY TO COLLAPSE ON THEIR OFF-LOAD RUN TO AKUTAN ISLAND. HOPEFULLY, BY TONIGHT WE'LL BE DONE. THAT'S THE GOAL. Jake: FIRST ONE WAS ABOUT 300. NOW WE'RE GETTING LIKE 400s, ALL CLEAN CRAB, REALLY GOOD. I LIKE LOOKING UP IN THE SKY IN THE MORNING, 'CAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU GOT AROUND HERE. MISERABLE. OUCH. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. SORRY. ABOUT 400 CRAB. RIGHT NOW, JAKE? IT MIGHT SLIP A LITTLE. IT'S A BAD BRIDLE, MAN. THAT LOOKS GOOD -- LOOKS REAL GOOD. THE FISHING COULDN'T BE BETTER RIGHT NOW. Narrator: SIG MAY HAVE DIALED IN, BUT ON DECK, THE HIGH POTS BRING A MIXED BAG OF EMOTIONS. WHAT A POT OF [BLEEP] 700 COMES OVER THE RAIL AND YOU'RE NOT EXCITED, YEAH, THAT'S WHEN OPIE FISHING GETS OLD. WE GOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND GET THEM WHILE THEY'RE HOT. BACK IN THE HONEY HOLE! SO, BEING TIRED IS JUST PART OF THE JOB. IT JUST MEANS I DON'T GET A COUPLE FREE DAYS OF FEELING GOOD. Sig: MATT JUST SAID HE FELT LIKE HE JUST WORKED 100 HOURS IN 3 DAYS. I WAS LAUGHING FOR 5 MINUTES ON THAT ONE. Narrator: ON A RUN BETWEEN STRINGS, CAPTAIN AHAB LETS THE CREW GRAB A CATNAP. [ SNORING ] Narrator: BUT IT ONLY LASTS 30 MINUTES. WAKE UP! NO, IT'S NOT TYPICAL TO DO A 3-DAY TRIP AT ALMOST 220,000, 210,000 POUNDS. THAT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO. NOW WE HAVE THESE DELIVERY DATES. THEY TELL US HOW MUCH TO BRING IN. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY'RE LIKE, "BRING IN MORE. BY THE WAY, DO IT FASTER." OKAY. Narrator: THE CREW, WELL BEYOND THEIR BREAKING POINTS, GETS BACK TO THE ROBOTIC  NORTHWESTERN GRIND. [ SEAGULL CAWING ] TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, CAPTAIN SIG WANTS THE TANK STUFFED. THAT MEANS THE CREW WILL BE ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES. KEEP PUTTING THEM IN ONE BY ONE TILL WE'RE DONE. WE'RE TRYING TO STUFF THE TANKS, AND THEY'RE ALL FULL. BUT THEY'RE SETTLING SLOWLY, SO... SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO WONDER WHY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU COME TO THESE PARTS VERY OFTEN? PRETTY CLOSE. I'LL TAKE A PEEK. THAT ONE'S FULL. THAT ONE'S GETTING FULL. THAT ONE'S FULL. IT'S PRETTY DAMN CLOSE. TWO POTS LEFT. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE ROOM FOR THEM. I'M SURE WE'LL MAKE ROOM. NOW WHAT DO YOU DO? Narrator: SIG HAS STUFFED HIS TANKS IN RECORD TIME. OH, YEAH! Sig: AND THAT'S THE LAST POT. [ CHEERING ] NICE JOB. GOT A COUPLE MILES,  THEN WE'LL SET THOSE POTS, AND THEN WE GOT TO BOOGIE, MAN. [ CHEERING CONTINUES ] THEY'RE HAPPY. OH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] HELL, YEAH, SHE'S STUFFED. LIKE A TURKEY GOOSE. WE PUSHED IT TO THE LIMIT, SO THEY SHOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES. Narrator: ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH"... JUST DOESN'T STOP AROUND HERE, MAN. HOLD ON! Narrator: IT'S WINTRY HELL ON THE BERING SEA... WHOO! ...WITH NO SIGNS OF LETTING UP. ROGUE WAVES LEAVE THE FLEET IN RUINS. GET OUT OF THE WAY! [ ALARM RINGING ] WHAT WAS THAT? Sig: IF THAT WASN'T A 90-DEGREE ROLL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. Narrator: AND A SKIPPER BEGINS THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. Phil: THAT ONE'S A GOOD ONE. THIS IS STARTING TO GET TO ME, MAN. GO LAY DOWN. I CAN'T BREATHE.
