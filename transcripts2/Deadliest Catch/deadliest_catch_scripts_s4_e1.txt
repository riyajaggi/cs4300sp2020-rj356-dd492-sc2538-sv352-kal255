 YOU NEED TO GET YOUR RAIN GEAR ON. WE GOT GEAR FLYING AROUND OUTSIDE. HANG ON! [ MID-TEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ] Narrator: AFTER A TWO-WEEK JOURNEY FROM PORTS ACROSS THE LOWER 48, THE 74-VESSEL CRAB-FISHING FLEET ARRIVES FOR THIS YEAR'S $86-MILLION KING CRAB HARVEST. WELCOME BACK TO DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA. ON THE NORTHWESTERN, BLOODLINES ARE REINFORCED WITH THE ADDITION OF A NEW FAMILY CREST. Sig: THAT'S THE NEW HANSEN SHIELD. LIKE MY DAD, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT THE CREST ON THE FRONT OF THE BOAT WITH THE "S.H."

 WE WANT TO KEEP THAT. THAT'S NEVER GOING ANYWHERE AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE. SO, THIS IS FOR ME AND MY BROTHERS. THIS IS OUR EMBLEM. Narrator: ON THE TIME BANDIT, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN KEEPS THE HILLSTRAND FAMILY TRADITION ALIVE WITH A NEW HIRE, HIS 25-YEAR-OLD SON, SCOTT. MY SON SCOTT -- HE'S BEEN ON THE BOAT BEFORE. HE WANTED TO TAKE OVER THE SHOW WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER WHEN HE WAS 20. I DON'T KNOW -- EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID, I'VE BEEN OUT HERE FISHING AND HANGING OUT AND BEING PART OF THE BOYS. Andy: I JUST WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM STEP UP, 'CAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO HILLSTRAND BOYS BELOW US THAT ARE -- NEIL'S GOT TWO BOYS THAT HAVE NO INTEREST IN IT. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ABOARD THE CORNELIA MARIE, CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS TESTS HIS CREW WITH A SURVIVAL-SUIT DRILL. EVERYBODY HAS TO GET THEM OUT OF THE BAG AND ON. 1, 2, 3, GO. Man: GET IT ON! COME ON, MARK. LET'S GO, BUDDY. LET'S GO! YEAH! HEY, PULL YOUR FLAP. 36 SECONDS. HOPEFULLY, GOD WILLING, THIS NEVER DOES HAPPEN. Narrator: THE WIZARD IS ALREADY IN REPAIR MODE. DURING THE JOURNEY NORTH, A 40-FOOT ROGUE WAVE TORE A 6-INCH HOLE IN THE STEEL HULL. Man: I THINK THERE'S JUST A SPLIT SEAM DOWN HERE RIGHT ON THE WELD. BUT FOR NOW, WE'LL JUST PATCH IT UP WITH THIS. THIS IS A TEMPORARY FIX, WITHOUT QUESTION. IT'S JUST TO KIND OF MILK US ALONG HERE UNTIL WE CAN GET TO THE YARD AND DO SOME MAJOR STEEL WORK. [ SEA GULL CALLING ] COMING DOWN. Narrator: IN JUST 48 HOURS, THE BATTLE FOR THE 20-MILLION-POUND KING CRAB HARVEST BEGINS. CREWS SCRAMBLE TO LOAD POTS, BAIT, AND SUPPLIES ONTO THEIR VESSELS. YEAH, DROP IT. THEY'RE PUTTING THE LAST CHAIN ON HERE IN PORT. THE STACK'S BOUND DOWN. IT'S IDEAL. IT'S SAFE. IT'S EASY. Narrator: THE TIME BANDIT'S POT STACK IS TOPPED OFF. BUT THE BOYS HAVE ONE LAST HUNK OF METAL TO STRAP DOWN -- A DUTCH HARBOR MEMENTO FOR CAPTAIN PHIL ON THE CORNELIA MARIE. WELL, PHIL WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE NEEDED A NEW TRUCK. SO WE FOUND HIM ONE. IT'S GONNA NEED A LITTLE BIT OF WORK, BUT I THINK HE'LL APPRECIATE IT. THEY'RE GONNA [BLEEP] WHEN THEY PULL THAT OVER THE RAIL. Narrator: WITH CREWS BUSY DOING ALL THE DIRTY WORK, CAPTAINS GATHER AT THE LOCAL WATERING HOLE. Johnathan: YOU'RE GONNA QUIT SMOKING? WHEN? I THINK JANUARY 1st. LET'S WORK ON ONE OF OUR OTHER HORRIBLE VICES -- ROUND OF DRINKS. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: BEFORE BUSINESS, A TRADITIONAL ROUND OF DUTCH HARBOR DUCK FARTS IS ORDERED, A MIXTURE OF CROWN ROYAL, BAILEY'S, AND KAHLúA. Johnathan: SO, I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE IN STORE FOR SOME WEATHER THIS YEAR. THE LAST THREE WEEKS, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE STORMS? THEY'VE ALL TRACKED RIGHT THROUGH THE BRISTOL BAY. SO, YOU GUYS GOT THE [BLEEP] KICKED OUT OF YOU COMING UP HERE. THE BOAT GOT HAMMERED. FIVE DAYS AGO, MONTE COLBURN, CAPTAIN KEITH'S BROTHER, WAS AT THE HELM WHEN THE WIZARD WAS SLAMMED BY A 40-FOOT ROGUE WAVE ON HER 2,000-MILE JOURNEY FROM SEATTLE TO DUTCH HARBOR. WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE? Lekanoff: WATER'S COMING IN MY STATEROOM. WE NEED TO CHANGE CORDS OR SOMETHING. SEE, THE POTS ARE TWISTED AND CONTORTED AND EVERYTHING. THEY'RE BENT OUT OF SHAPE. LET'S GO! Monte: WE WENT OVER A WAVE IN THE NIGHT. THE STERN -- DAVE WAS IN THE GALLEY. HE HIT HIS HEAD ON THE CEILING. SO, YOU HAD ONE POT THAT WAS IN THE FRONT, AND IT TOOK FIVE OTHER POTS OUT? NO, THERE WAS LIKE 14. 14 POTS? WOW. ALL OF US HAVE DONE THAT CROSSING, AND IT'S A BITCH. OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, THE SEASON HASN'T EVEN STARTED. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: DESPITE THEIR LAUGHTER, EACH CAPTAIN UNDERSTANDS THE COLD TRUTH OF FISHING THE BERING SEA. MAN OVERBOARD! MAN OVERBOARD! [ LAUGHTER ] NOT EVERYONE RETURNS ALIVE. MAN: They were abandoning ship and getting in a life raft. Keith: SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE MAYBE IT'S KIND OF DESENSITIZING ME. MAN: The basket's inside the aircraft. Hoist complete. Narrator: THESE MEN NOT ONLY GAMBLE THEIR LIVES ON THE BERING SEA, BUT THEY ALSO ENJOY PLACING WAGERS FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS. Johnathan: WHAT KIND OF BET ARE WE GONNA HAVE THIS YEAR? I WAS THINKING MAYBE LIKE A HIGH POT OF THE DAY. NO, 'CAUSE YOU'RE FISHING 8-BYs. DON'T [BLEEP] [ LAUGHTER ] Andy: THEY'RE 7x8s. I GOT 7x8s! HE WANTS SOAK TIME 'CAUSE HE'S PLANNING ON LEAVING THEM SIT THERE FOR THREE WEEKS. Sig: HOW ABOUT JUST THE BEST STRING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? YOU HAVE TO SAY THE STRING BEFORE YOU DROP THAT POT. DESIGNATE THAT STRING BEFORE YOU HAUL IT. THAT'S THE STRING YOU'RE GONNA USE. ALL RIGHT, IS THAT THE BET, THEN? WE CALL IT BEFORE WE HAUL IT? 25-POT? HEY, HOW MUCH DOUGH WE STICKING ON THIS? 100 BUCKS A WEEK. WE'LL MEET BACK HERE AFTER IT'S OVER. YEAH. THE MAIN THING IS EVERYONE COME HOME SAFE AND DRY. BRING 'EM ALL BACK. EVERYONE, COME HOME SAFE. Narrator: EACH WEEK, THE CAPTAINS WILL SET A 25-POT STRING. WHOEVER HAULS IN THE HIGHEST AVERAGE WINS THE WEEK. Phil: YEAH! [ CHEERING ] Narrator: THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS. KING CRAB SEASON IS LESS THAN 24 HOURS AWAY. CREWS RACE TO READY THEIR VESSELS FOR OPENING DAY. OVER ON THE WIZARD, CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN DECIDES TO MAKE A MAJOR GAMBLE. NOT ONLY WILL HE BE SKIPPERING A VESSEL WITH A SPLIT SEAM, HE'LL ROLL THE DICE WITH NOT ONE BUT TWO GREENHORNS. I'M GLAD WE'RE GETTING THE HELL OUT TO GO AND DO IT. Keith: OH, YEAH. I KNOW. THAT'S A LOT OF WORK TO GET READY TO GO FISH, ISN'T IT? SIX FRICKIN' WEEKS OF -- I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT WAS [BLEEP] NO, THERE'S A LOT OF PREP WORK INVOLVED WITH TRYING TO GET THE BOAT READY TO GO FISH. IT'S TRAINING CAMP. YEAH. YEAH. BUT TRAINING CAMP AND GAME DAY ARE TWO DIFFERENT BALLS OF WAX. Moilanen: BASICALLY, I QUIT MY JOB, TOOK MY LAST PAYCHECK, USED THAT TO GET ME THROUGH TO NOW, RUN MYSELF DOWN TO ABOUT $40 LEFT IN MY WALLET. I CAN'T GO BACK TO THAT JOB. AND THIS IS A HUGE CHANCE I'M TAKING. IF I GOT FIRED TODAY, I'D BE OUT ON THE STREET. Narrator: AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER IS 21-YEAR-OLD GREENHORN LYNN GITARD. AND FOR THE MOMENT, THE OLD SALTS QUESTION THE GREENHORN'S WORK ETHIC. LYNN IS THE ONE I AM WORRIED ABOUT BECAUSE HE JUST HAS THIS LITTLE LOOK ON HIS FACE. HE'S JUST -- HE WANTS TO DO IT. I CAN TELL. YOU MIGHT WANT TO FILE ON THAT STEP, TOO. TRY THAT. NO, FLAT, THE OTHER WAY. NO, JUST FLIP IT OVER. WATCH IT. DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDEA YET WHAT HE'S GETTING INTO. GO GRAB ME SOME OF THEM BOXES OUT HERE, THOSE EMPTY BOXES. HE'S THE KIND OF GUY YOU HAVE TO POINT AND TELL WHAT TO DO ALL THE TIME. YOU WANT THEM BOXES THAT WERE UP ON THE DOCK OR THE FOOD BOXES? THE FOOD BOXES. Narrator: WITH 15 HOURS TO GO, VESSELS CLOSE IN ON THEIR PREPARATIONS. BUT THE NORTHWESTERN IS DEAD IN THE WATER. ENGINEER EDGAR HANSEN ASSESSES THE DAMAGE TO HIS PROPELLER SHAFT. Edgar: WELL, YOU GOT A BAD BEARING, YOU GOT A BENT SHAFT, AND THEN A BAD CUTLASS BEARING. SO, I KNOW THAT I DON'T WANT HER GOING BAD WHEN I'M OUT THERE. Narrator: THE PROPELLER SHAFT MUST BE STRAIGHTENED. IF THE DAMAGED COMPONENT WENT UNREPAIRED, IT COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE VIBRATION, LEADING TO CATASTROPHIC MECHANICAL FAILURE. THE SINGLE-PROP NORTHWESTERN WOULD BE POWERLESS AND AT THE COMPLETE MERCY OF THE BERING SEA. OUR DIVERS ONLY GOT THINGS HALFWAY WELDED DOWN. I DON'T WANT TO RUSH THEM. Sig: WHEN'S HE GONNA BE DONE? AS SOON AS HE'S DONE. I JUST WANT TO GO FISHING RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. I MEAN, EVERY MINUTE THE CLOCK TICKS, THE MORE YOU'RE STRESSING OVER IT. IT'S TIME. TIME IS WHAT MAKES US MONEY. Narrator: THIS YEAR'S KING CRAB SEASON MAY START WITHOUT THE HANSENS AND THE NORTHWESTERN. WITH EIGHT HOURS LEFT, THE CORNELIA MARIE IS IN "GO" MODE. WE JUST NEED TO STACK IT DOWN HERE, GUYS. YEAH, HERE WE GO, FREDDIE. BUT 21-YEAR-OLD JAKE HARRIS IS ON A PERSONAL MISSION. THE CAPTAIN'S YOUNGEST SON HAS DECIDED TO ENTERTAIN HIMSELF AT HIS FATHER'S EXPENSE. WHILE THE CREW OF THE CORNELIA MARIE LOADS THE FINAL POTS, JAKE CONSTRUCTS A MOUNT FOR HIS NEW TELEVISION. I BOUGHT A FLAT SCREEN. HOW BIG? IT'S 24-INCH WIDTH. 24-INCH? HOW'D YOU PAY FOR THAT? YEAH, IT WAS KIND OF A CHARGE ON THE OLD MAN'S BILL THERE. Narrator: THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE HARRIS BOYS HAVE TAKEN A FEW LIBERTIES WITH THEIR FATHER'S CREDIT CARD. GOING OUT SPENDING $1,000, $1,500, CHARGE, CHARGE, CHARGE -- HE DON'T EVEN ASK. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M THE [BLEEP] BANK HERE. BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY GEAR -- DON'T TALK! ZERO! THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO GET THIS INSTALLED, 'CAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NOT GONNA LET ME TAKE IT BACK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AW, JAKE. I OUGHT TO FIRE YOUR [BLEEP] RIGHT NOW. WELL, YOU CAN GET YOUR SORRY [BLEEP] RIGHT BACK TO THE [BLEEP] HARDWARE. HOW MUCH WAS THIS? HOW MUCH? ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING? WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DON'T KNOW, DUDE. I WAS JUST -- "DUDE"? SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME, I'M GONNA POP YOU ONE RIGHT IN THE FACE. NO WONDER I GOT BLOOD-PRESSURE PROBLEMS. I'M SHAKING. I COULD JUST THROTTLE HIS ASS. [ SIGHS ] OH, YEAH. YEAH, I CAN SEE IT. I SHOULD FIRE HIS ASS. GOD, THAT KID. NOW YOU KNOW WHY LIONS EAT THEIR YOUNG. Narrator: FIVE HOURS AND COUNTING -- THE CRAB-FISHING FLEET BEGINS TO MAKE THEIR WAY OUT TO SEA. BUT BEFORE THE TIME BANDIT LEAVES, THE HILLSTRANDS MAKE THEIR RITUAL PRE-TRIP TELEPHONE CALL TO THEIR MOTHER. HELLO? IT'S HARD TO GET ALL FOUR OF US TOGETHER IN ONE SPOT. BUT ME AND SCOTT WILL HAVE LOTS OF TIME. WE NEVER GET TO SEE EACH OTHER THIS MUCH. IT'S PRETTY GOOD THAT WE GET TO SPEND THIS MUCH TIME TOGETHER. WE SURE MISS YOU GUYS. SO, YEAH, I LOVE YOU GUYS, TOO. BUT MOTHER HILLSTRAND TELLS THE BOYS OF A PREMONITION THAT TRAGEDY WILL STRIKE THE TIME BANDIT THIS SEASON. AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS PREDICTED THE FUTURE. Andy: MY MOM'S ALWAYS HAD, LIKE, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM. SHE'S BEEN REALLY RELIGIOUS HER WHOLE LIFE. LAST YEAR, SHE HAD A FEELING THAT WE WERE GONNA SAVE A GUY OUT OF THE WATER. SHE HAD A DREAM WE WERE GONNA RESCUE A GUY OUT OF THE WATER. Narrator: DURING LAST YEAR'S KING CRAB SEASON, THE TIME BANDIT DEFIED ALL ODDS WHEN THEY PLUCKED A DOOMED FISHERMAN FROM THE ICY GRIP OF THE BERING SEA. MAN OVERBOARD! MAN OVERBOARD! RIGHT HERE, BUDDY. Andy: OKAY, HELP HIM IN HERE, GUYS. Johnathan: HE'S WARM? HE'S IN SHOCK, I'M PRETTY SURE. BUT HE'S CONSCIOUS AND TALKING. I SAW YOU DISAPPEAR. YOU SAVED MY LIFE, MAN. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU. BUT SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN DOING THAT FOR 26 YEARS OF OUR LIFE, HATED THE FACT THAT WE FISH. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. WHEN IT'S YOUR TIME TO GO, IT'S YOUR TIME TO GO. AND SO, IF I DIE FISHING, I DIE DOING WHAT I LOVE TO DO. ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF DUTCH HARBOR AND ALASKA, WHO WISH YOU A SAFE AND PROSPEROUS FISHING SEASON... PLEASE STAND BY AS PASTORAL  LEADER HENRIETTA CALLEWAERT DELIVERS THE BLESSING  OF THE FLEET. Callewaert:  GOD OF BOUNDLESS LOVE, BLESS THESE BOATS, THEIR EQUIPMENT, AND ALL WHO USE THEM. PROTECT THEM FROM THE DANGERS  OF WIND AND RAIN AND ALL THE PERILS OF THE DEEP. MAY CHRIST,  WHO CALMED THE STORM AND FILLED THE NETS  OF HIS DISCIPLES... [ STATIC CRACKLING ] Man: I HATE THAT. Man #2: THEY GONNA PLAY THAT AGAIN OR WHAT? Johnathan: I GUESS WE'RE CUT OFF. IT STOPPED. THAT'S NOT A GOOD START. I HOPE THAT'S NOT AN OMEN. YEAH. EVERYONE BE SAFE, MAN. LET'S WATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS. THEY'LL BE FINE. [ STATIC CRACKLING ] [ SEA GULL CALLS ] GETTING READY FOR KING CRAB, GET THIS THING STARTED. HEY, DAVE, YOU WANT TO GRAB THESE? Andy: WE'RE GOING FISHING, RUSS! IT'S ABOUT TIME. YEAH. THE MINIMUM PRICE IS $4.20 A POUND. 300,000 POUNDS -- $1.2 MILLION. 1, 2. [ HORN BLOWS ] Moilanen: WE'RE FINALLY GONNA GO MAKE SOME MONEY AFTER A MONTH AND A HALF OF SCREWING AROUND RIGGING POTS, GETTING BAIT ON BOARD, ALL THE LITTLE STUFF THAT GOES ALONG WITH THIS JOB, I GUESS. FINALLY, WE GET TO GO ACTUALLY DO IT. Keith: DID WE LOSE SOMETHING,  FELLAS? ROGER! Leveen: END OF THE DAY, THE SUN IS SETTING, AND OUR SEASON'S ABOUT TO BEGIN. IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD ONE. EVERYBODY'S PRETTY JAMMIN'. Narrator: THE MEN HAVE WAITED ALL YEAR FOR THIS MOMENT. AND NOW THERE'S NO TURNING BACK. WITH 24 HOURS UNTIL BOATS REACH THE FISHING GROUNDS, CREWS SLEEP SOUNDLY IN THE RACKS. BUT FOR THE CAPTAINS, THE MENTAL TORMENT BEGINS. Phil: THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON GETTING THESE BOATS OUT OF TOWN. I HAVE TO GET IN THE ZONE. I HAVE TO GET IN MY RIGHT FRAME OF MIND FOR THIS. AND I'M NOT THERE YET. Narrator: AS THE BOATS MAKE THEIR WAY OUT INTO THE UNKNOWN, CAPTAINS AND CREWS COUNT THEIR BLESSINGS AND LOOK FOR SIGNS. WIZARD BASE, WIZARD.  WIZARD BASE, WIZARD. WE GOT A WHALE ON THE STARBOARD SIDE RIGHT UP HERE. Man: IS THAT GOOD LUCK OR WHAT? I THINK WHALES ARE GOOD LUCK. MOUSE, HELP ME ON THIS ONE. Monte: WHALES ARE DEFINITELY GOOD LUCK. RIGHT ON. WE'LL TAKE WHALES ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. OH, MAN. THEY'RE SPOUTING OFF BIG-TIME. Narrator: EARLY REPORTS INDICATE FAVORABLE WEATHER FOR THE TIME BEING. BUT CONDITIONS OUT HERE CAN CHANGE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. Johnathan: THIS FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK OUT HERE, MAN. LOOK AT THIS. THIS WEATHER'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. THIS WEATHER JUST AIN'T RIGHT. WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS. KNOCK ON WOOD. SO KNOCK ON WOOD AGAIN. Narrator: NEXT ON "DEADLIEST CATCH," THE FIRST POTS ARE SPLASHED. 232! BUT SUPERSTITION KEEPS THE WIZARD AT BAY. Keith: BASICALLY, I WON'T SET GEAR WITHOUT A CUP OF NOODLES CUP UP HERE TO USE FOR MY SPITTOON. IT IS INSANE. Narrator: 225 MILES FROM DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT APPROACHES HER FISHING GROUNDS. CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN AND YOUNGER BROTHER ANDY BEGIN PLOTTING OUT THEIR KING CRAB STRATEGY. Andy: WHAT WE'RE HEARING RIGHT NOW IS THERE AIN'T VERY MANY CRAB OUT HERE IN A LOT OF TRADITIONAL SPOTS. SO WE'RE HOPING THEY'RE UP SHALLOW, OR WE'RE SCREWED. THIS YEAR'S FISH-AND-GAME SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT THE KING CRAB POPULATION IS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE BERING SEA AND NOT CONCENTRATED IN SMALLER POCKETS AS IN PAST SEASONS. Johnathan: I DON'T HAVE A REAL GOOD FEELING ABOUT SETTING HERE. THAT'S TYPICALLY HOW WE START OUT EVERY SEASON. HE HAS A SURVEY. HE LOOKS AT IT. WE GO, "PLAN 'A,' UP HERE. NO, PLAN 'B.'" AND WE ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH PLAN "A." SO, WE WERE HEADED NORTH. NOW WE'RE HEADED DUE EAST. THEN EVERY CUP OF COFFEE YOU DRINK, YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND. HYAH! YEAH! Scott: WE GOT 100 POTS ON THE BOAT RIGHT NOW. WE USUALLY PUT TWO JARS IN A POT AND TWO TO THREE COD, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE. Narrator: SCOTTY, THE YOUNGEST HILLSTRAND, HAS ALREADY BEGUN MAKING RIFTS WITH SOME OF THE CREW. HE CAME ON THE BOAT GIVING ORDERS, AND I NEVER MET HIM BEFORE. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS JOHNATHAN'S SON WHEN I FIRST MET HIM. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH THE BOAT AND EVERYTHING. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN YOU DO? THAT'S LIFE. HE'S FAMILY, AND I'M NOT. I'M EXPENDABLE. Narrator: SCOTT'S PERFORMANCE WILL NOT GO UNCHECKED, EVEN IF HE IS A HILLSTRAND. WE'LL SEE WHAT HE CAN DO AND HOW HE HANDLES HIMSELF. WE'RE GONNA TAKE TURNS, AND WE'RE GONNA ROTATE ON DECK, AND SCOTTY'S GONNA HAVE TO STEP UP AND DO ALL THE SAME JOBS THAT THE REST OF US ARE GONNA HAVE TO DO. Narrator: IT'S MIDNIGHT, AND THIS YEAR'S KING CRAB SEASON IS OFFICIALLY OPEN. WE'RE READY TO ROLL RIGHT NOW. FIRST CRAB POT OF THE SEASON! Man: WHOO! YEAH, WE'RE JUST SLOWING DOWN. I GOT TO MOVE THAT TRUCK AND WORK AROUND IT. Man: IT'S IN OUR WAY. NORMALLY, I WOULD WALK THROUGH THE ALLEYWAY, BUT I HAVE A TRUCK IN THE WAY. Narrator: BUT BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN PUT THEIR FIRST POT IN THE WATER, THE PRACTICAL JOKE INTENDED FOR THE CORNELIA MARIE RAPIDLY DETERIORATES INTO A COMEDY OF ERRORS. Man: THAT'S PERFECT RIGHT THERE  IF YOU WANT ME TO SET IT THERE. MAN, WATCH MY TRUCK, DAMN IT. I JUST GOT THAT PAINT JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST CRAB-POT STRING. ROCK 'N' ROLL. 140 GOING OUT! [ CHEERING ] 232! THE CRAB POT'S IN. YOO-HOO! [ WARBLING ] Man: 159! Narrator: AFTER 25 POTS SPLASH OVER THE RAIL, THE TIME BANDIT HITS HER FULL STRIDE. BUT ONCE AGAIN, THE MACHINE COMES TO A GRINDING HALT... [ LAUGHTER ] ...AS PHIL'S TRUCK MUST BE RE-PARKED. Andy: YEAH! Man: DAMN! HOLY [BLEEP] PERFECT. THAT WAS, UH... SOME KIND OF PARALLEL PARKING. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, 80 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST, CAPTAIN KEITH DRIVES THE WIZARD WITHIN A FEW MILES OF HER FISHING GROUNDS. EVERY CAPTAIN HAS HIS OWN ROUTINE. BUT KEITH COLBURN TAKES HIS RITUALS SERIOUSLY. HE BELIEVES THAT IT'S BAD LUCK FOR THE CAPTAIN TO PREPARE THE CAPTAIN'S LOG. A COUPLE ODDITIES THAT I DON'T DO -- BASICALLY, IN OUR PAPERWORK, BOOK WORK, I WON'T PUT THE LINES IN. I HAVEN'T DONE IT SINCE 1996. Monte: THIS IS HOW WE KEEP TRACK OF THE GEAR, THE POSITIONS, AND THE COUNTS, THE BUOY NUMBERS. A HANDFUL OF TIMES I'VE DONE IT IN THE LAST 10 OR 15 YEARS, AND EVERY TIME, IT SEEMS LIKE THE SET COMES BACK CRAPPY. MONTE'S NOT NEARLY AS QUIRKY AS I AM, BUT -- WAS IT QUIRKY OR CREEPY? [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: AS THEY PREPARE TO DROP THEIR FIRST POTS OF THE SEASON, THEIR SUPERSTITIOUS CAPTAIN REALIZES THAT THERE IS ONE GOOD-LUCK RITUAL THAT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. BASICALLY, I WON'T SET GEAR -- UNLESS I'M FORCED TO -- WITHOUT A CUP OF NOODLES CUP UP HERE TO USE FOR MY SPITTOON. AS SOON AS CROSBY'S GOT THAT CHAIN DEALT WITH, CAN YOU GET A COUPLE GUYS WORKING ON THE CUP OF NOODLES  SITUATION? Soper: WE HAD SOME WHEN WE LEFT SEATTLE, AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM NOW. I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. IT IS DEFINITELY A SUPERSTITIOUS ISSUE. IT'S WORKED IN THE PAST, AND WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE IT. IF HE WANTS ME TO FIND IT, WELL, WE HAVE TO TRY. EVERYTHING WAS GROOVING, EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING GOOD, AND NOW I GOT THIS. Narrator: CROSBY, LAST YEAR'S GREENHORN, OFFERS A SOLUTION. HEY, KEITH. YEAH? I GOT A PEACE OFFERING FROM THE CREW. WHAT DO YOU GOT? I GOT THIS. YOU CAN SPIT INTO THIS. IT'S STAINLESS. IT'LL CLEAN UP NICELY. DON'T WORRY. YOU GUYS JUST -- DON'T SWEAT IT. AS EXPECTED, IT WAS THOUGHTFULLY TURNED DOWN. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BERING SEA NOT DOING WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING, WHICH IS CRAB FISHING -- SEARCHING FOR A STYROFOAM CUP OF NOODLES. IT IS INSANE. NOW HE THINKS I'M CRAZY AS HELL NOW. I THINK WE'RE OUT OF LUCK. DARN IT. DID YOU COMPLETELY TEAR APART THOSE SHELVES IN THE SECOND HEAD? AND WE DON'T HAVE ONE [BLEEP] ONE OF THOSE ON THE BOAT? NOT ONE? SOPER: No. Unh-unh. ALL RIGHT, SOPER, YOU WANT TO GO FISH LIKE THAT, THAT'S YOUR CALL, OKAY? BUT I'M NOT REAL COMFORTABLE WITH IT. Narrator: CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND HIS CONTROL FORCE KEITH'S HAND. I MEAN, IF IT AIN'T HAPPENING, IT AIN'T HAPPENING, BUT... Narrator: THE WIZARD WILL DROP POTS WITHOUT KEITH'S LUCKY TALISMAN IN PLACE. IF THIS IS OUR BIGGEST DISASTER OF THE SEASON, I'LL BE A HAPPY MAN. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LET HER GO. HERE WE GO! YEP! WHOO-HOO! Man: WE'RE MAKING MONEY RIGHT THERE. Man #2: RIGHT ON. IT MIGHT JUST BE SUPERSTITIONS, BUT LAST THING YOU NEED IS SOMETHING WEIRD FLOATING AROUND INSIDE YOUR HEAD OUT HERE. I MEAN, GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE GOING THROUGH HERE. Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH'S SUPERSTITIOUS ARSENAL SURROUNDS HIM. HE'LL TAKE ANY MEASURE TO PREVENT THE BERING SEA FROM RISING UP AND BARING HER TEETH. MAN: They were abandoning ship and getting in a life raft. THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR'S KING CRAB SEASON WAS MARRED BY THE SINKING OF THE FISHING VESSEL  OCEAN CHALLENGER. We have a survivor at 2:00. I see something orange around 2:00, about 300 yards out. I got a Drysuit at 3:00. It's empty. MAN: I don't see a survivor with it. THE FISHING BOAT WENT DOWN IN HEAVY SEAS... He's over here. He's holding on to debris. ...SPARING THE LIFE OF ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR MEN ON BOARD. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE MEASURE OF A GOOD SEASON IS JUST GETTING BACK TO TOWN WITH EVERYBODY SAFE. Narrator: IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF KING CRAB'S OPENING DAY, CAPTAIN SIG IS STILL IN THE HARBOR, TESTING REPAIRS MADE TO THE  NORTHWESTERN'S PROPELLER SHAFT. Sig: THE GUYS THAT ARE LOOKING AT THE ENGINE, THE MECHANICS -- THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH TO GO. AND SO WE'LL GO. AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO MONKEY WITH IT ANYWAY. Narrator: UNDER THE GUN, SIG DECIDES TO DIG DEEP INTO THE NORTHWESTERN'S ARCHIVES. Sig: THERE'S SOME OLD BOOKS IN THERE, SOME OLD LOG BOOKS. TO MOST GUYS, IT'S JUST JUNK AND PAPER. BUT TO ME, IT'S A GOLD MINE. Narrator: THESE RECORDS HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN THROUGH THE HANSEN FISHING DYNASTY. YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE OLD. YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT THE OLD CHART AND KIND OF WHERE WE WERE UP ABOVE HERE, I WAS THINKING TO KIND OF SWITCH IT UP AND DO THE OPPOSITE. AND I WAS THINKING TO TRY TO START WAY DOWN SOUTH A LITTLE DEEPER THIS YEAR. GO DEEPER? THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING. GUYS AROUND TOWN -- IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT'S WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE IS STARTING. I THINK A LOT OF GUYS ARE GONNA JUMP RIGHT OVER CRAB. AND I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO GO AND FOLLOW A BUNCH OF SHEEP. WE'VE HAD SEASONS DOWN THERE IN THE PAST WHERE WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL. AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY YEAR. MAYBE THIS IS ONE OF THEM. AS THE CREW HUSTLES TO GET THE POTS ON BOARD, LAST YEAR'S GREENHORN, JAKE ANDERSON, HAS HIS SIGHTS SET MUCH HIGHER THIS YEAR. WELL, THIS SEASON, I'M GONNA TRY TO BE PUT IN THE ROTATION. I DON'T SEE IT AS A PROBLEM, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK IF YOU WANT TO MAKE FULL SHARE. Narrator: JAKE'S SALARY WILL QUADRUPLE IF HE PROVES HE HAS ENOUGH KNOW-HOW TO HANDLE ANYTHING THE BERING SEA OR HIS CREW CAN THROW AT HIM. Sig: IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST GO INTO THIS TRANSITION FROM BEING A GREENHORN AND THEN A FULL SHARE. AND THERE'S NO MOMENT THAT SAYS, "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED." IT TAKES TIME. AND IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO GAIN RESPECT FROM YOUR CREW MEMBERS. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF IT. Narrator: BUT IN ORDER TO PROVE HE'S WORTHY OF A FULL SHARE, HE MUST FIRST SHAKE HIS LINGERING GREENHORN STATUS. JUST FALL ON IT. Bradley: WHAT DO YOU WEIGH RIGHT NOW, JAKE? 120? I AM ABOUT TO WALK AWAY. I ASKED YOU A NICE, SIMPLE QUESTION. I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH IT. [BLEEP] YOU. I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH IT. I WENT NOWHERE WITH IT. COME ON, JAKE. GIVE ME SOME HELP, DUDE. [ LAUGHTER ] Sig: ONE THING IS FOR SURE. EVERYBODY HAS A BREAKING POINT, AND EVERYBODY HAS A LIMIT. [BLEEP] YOU GUYS. I ALREADY HATE YOU GUYS. NO, JAKE, DON'T CRY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS? HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE ANIMOSITY. AND IT'S ALREADY THERE, SO WE'LL JUST FUEL THE FIRE, A LITTLE STARTING FLUID ON IT. Sig: THEY ACTUALLY FIND ENJOYMENT AND FUN IN FINDING THAT BUTTON. [ SNICKERING ] GET BACK HERE, JAKE. Narrator: WITH REPAIRS COMPLETED AND POTS AND BAIT LOADED, THE NORTHWESTERN IS FINALLY READY TO BEGIN THEIR KING CRAB SEASON. BUT GREENHORN JAKE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. WHERE'S THE KID? MATT! JUNIOR! WHERE'S THE KID? I DON'T KNOW WHERE ANYBODY'S AT RIGHT NOW. Narrator: THE CLOCK IS TICKING. A DAY BEHIND, A MAN DOWN, SIG PULLS THE NORTHWESTERN AWAY FROM THE DOCK. WITH ALL BOATS YET TO HAUL POTS, THE YELLOW BOOK CRAB COUNT STANDS AT ZERO. Narrator: BACK AT THE DOCK, CAPTAIN SIG IS READY TO PUSH OFF, AND GREENHORN JAKE IS STILL MISSING. IF HE'S GOT TO GO, HE GOES. Narrator: JUST AS SIG PULLS THE NORTHWESTERN AWAY FROM THE DOCK, GREENHORN JAKE APPEARS. ONE MORE MINUTE, I WOULD HAVE NOT TURNED AROUND! THAT KID JUST ABOUT MISSED THE BOAT. I ALMOST LOST MY JOB. I'M NOT EVEN GONNA ASK. WHERE WERE YOU? THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPENSIVE PIECE OF [BLEEP] THAT'S A NORMAL THING THAT HAPPENS TO DUTCH HARBOR DECKHANDS -- LINES GET THROWN, CAPTAIN LEAVES, THE BOAT DON'T WAIT FOR YOU. Narrator: AS THE NORTHWESTERN DRIVES INTO THE NIGHT, CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN IS RELIEVED TO FINALLY BE OUT TO SEA. Sig: WE'RE NOT ON SCHEDULE BY ANY MEANS. WOULD I HAVE LIKED TO HAVE LEFT EARLIER? ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, WE WAITED LONG ENOUGH. I SURE IN THE HELL WASN'T GONNA WAIT FOR LOVER BOY TO GET OFF THE PHONE. IT'S FRICKIN' 3:00 IN THE MORNING. Narrator: 240 MILES NORTHWEST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE CORNELIA MARIE APPROACHES AN EIGHT-POT PROSPECT STRING. FOR CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS, THESE ARE PROVEN MONEYMAKING GROUNDS. Phil: IT'S ABOUT 5:00 IN THE MORNING. WE'RE JUST GETTING TO THE FIRST POT WE SET YESTERDAY. WE HAVE EIGHT POTS, AND WE'RE JUST GETTING BACK TO HAUL THEM RIGHT NOW. OKAY, YOU GUYS. THE FIRST POT OF THE DAY -- HOPEFULLY THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT. YEAH, WAIT. Man: ALL THE WAY ON, GUYS. Josh: COMING UP A LITTLE BIT. OKAY. Phil: I THINK THERE WAS THREE CRABS IN THAT ONE. BIG CATCH. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE LAST THING I EXPECTED TO SEE ON OPENING DAY OF KING CRAB. LOOK AT THAT -- JUST BLANK AS BLANK CAN BE. Man: NOT EVEN A COD. OH, YEAH. DAMN. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. THE LAST 20 YEARS, THERE'S BEEN CRAB HERE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HEARD OF THERE NOT BEING CRAB HERE. Narrator: THE 8-POT STRING, 12-HOUR SOAK YIELDED 7 CRAB. THIS YEAR, PHIL'S HONEY HOLE IS A BARREN WASTELAND. THIS REALLY IS STRANGE. I DON'T HAVE A CLUE ON WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT SOMETHING DEFINITELY IS. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT WHERE IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY BLANK. IF THERE WAS SOME CRAB THERE, YOU'D SEE SOMETHING -- 10s, 15s -- NOT ONES AND TWOS AND A BULLHEAD. Narrator: THEIR HOPES RISE WITH THE SUN AS THEY APPROACH ANOTHER PROSPECT STRING. MAYBE!
