 THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. WE'RE GONNA LOSE IT, SOPER. FOR THE FIRST HOUR AND A HALF HERE, YOU'LL BE FOUR-HANDED. Narrator: WITH ONLY FOUR MEN WORKING THE DECK AND TWICE AS MANY POTS TO MANEUVER... DAMN IT! ...KEITH NICKNAMES THIS STRING THE MAN-KILLER. 55 POTS IS WAY TOO MUCH TO ASK A CREW TO DO. 55 POTS IS PUSHING THEM OVER THE EDGE, AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS BASICALLY JUST A WARM-UP FOR THEM. THE MAN-KILLER'S STARTING RIGHT NOW. Narrator: GRINDING THROUGH THIS STRING WILL TAKE 100% FROM ALL HANDS, BUT DOWN ON DECK, THEY'RE ONE GREENHORN SHORT. MOI IS MISSING. Keith:  51 IS ALL IN THAT ONE? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WHAT IS THIS? I'M TIRED. YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS JUST STANDARD. Narrator: KEITH TAKES ONE GLANCE AT THE BROKEN HORN AND REALIZES WHAT THIS KID NEEDS ISN'T MORE INTIMIDATION BUT, RATHER, A LITTLE FATHERLY ADVICE. DO YOURSELF A COUPLE FAVORS -- THE HANDFUL OF SHORT BREAKS YOU GET, ALWAYS CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES. MAKE SURE YOU GET DRY CLOTHES. IF YOU'RE GOING OUT THERE IN WET CLOTHES, IT'S GONNA SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF YOU. SECONDLY, IF YOU GOT A 3- OR 4-MILE BREAK, FOOD, SECOND. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. EVEN IF IT'S A PIECE OF BREAD OR SOME CRACKERS. LASTLY, KEEP DRINKING FLUIDS. YOU GOT TO TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF. DRY CLOTHES, FOOD, AND FLUIDS. HELP ME OUT ON THIS ONE, ALL RIGHT? ALTHOUGH THE GREENHORN HAS HIT THE WALL, KEITH'S PEP TALK IS ENOUGH TO GET MOI OUT OF THE RACK AND UP FOR THE 12-HOUR MAN-KILLER SHIFT. ME AND LENNY AND TWO KIDS. SEE HOW WE'LL DO. WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. ALL RIGHT, FIRST ONE'S COMING UP. GOD, THIS STRING'S GONNA KILL US. FIRST 55 POT ARE MAN-KILLER. AS READY AS I'LL EVER BE. Man: OH, YEAH! WHAT YOU GOT, LENNY? 54. YOU'RE MY HERO. THAT'S A GOOD START. Man: RIGHT UP! Man #2: YEAH! BETTER AND BETTER! NUMBERS ARE PRETTY SOLID. 50s. WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GONNA GET 50s RIGHT HERE, BUT WE ARE. ONE TIME! THIS STRING IS PRETTY MUCH A PAIN IN MY ASS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVEN'T SEEN SOPER COMPLAIN, MONTE COMPLAIN, LENNY COMPLAIN, THE KID COMPLAIN, CROSBY COMPLAIN. NOBODY'S COMPLAINING ABOUT THE JOB. THE KID HAS NO CLUE WHAT THE JOB IS, BUT IS HE COMPLAINING? NO. IS MOI COMPLAINING? I THINK MOI MIGHT HAVE BIT OFF MORE THAN HE CAN CHEW, AND HE'S STARTING TO REALIZE THAT. JASON! JASON! YOU ALWAYS TIE IT IN THE FRONT! EVERY OTHER ONE IN THE BACK! EVERY TIME, THEY GOT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT JUST TO CONFUSE ME. Keith: IT'S JUST LIKE THIS ROLLER-COASTER RIDE FOR HIM, WHEREAS THE KID IS JUST STEADY AND SMOOTH, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED ON A BOAT. YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO JUST BE STEADY AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU'RE FISHING CRAB. TRY TO WORK AS HARD AS I CAN, MAYBE IT'LL GO NOTICED A LITTLE BIT. Narrator: BUT WITH JUST 8 POTS HAULED AND 47 LEFT TO GO, THE ROOKIES ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. JOGGING JUST 20 MILES SOUTH OF THE WIZARD IS THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE. IN THE 31 YEARS CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS HAS FISHED, NEVER HAS HE GONE THREE WEEKS WITHOUT FINDING THE CRAB. WELL, I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT WE GOT OFF TO THE START WE DID. I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE, BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TO QUIT FISHING AND GO IN TO UNLOAD RIGHT AWAY. Narrator: PHIL IS IN THE WORST POSSIBLE POSITION FOR A CRAB-BOAT SKIPPER -- 88,000 POUNDS TO CATCH, ZERO POTS FISHING, A DELIVERY DUE IN JUST THREE DAYS, AND WORST OF ALL, PHIL IS WITHOUT A PLAN. Phil: SO, YEAH, I'M NERVOUS. IT'S A NEW AREA FOR ME, AND SO... I'VE NEVER FISHED DOWN HERE BEFORE FOR KING CRAB. Gamrath: I'M SURE PHIL'S GOING BERSERK UP THERE IN THE WHEELHOUSE, AND HE'S GONNA BE SITTING UP THERE, A LOT OF PAPER GOING THROUGH HIS HAND. LOT OF CIGARETTES GOING THROUGH HIS MOUTH. ♪ OH, MY GOODNESS ♪ ♪ OH, MY LORD ♪ ♪ OH, MY GOODNESS ♪ ♪ GIVE ME A SIGN ♪ ♪ I'VE BEEN WAITING ♪ ♪ ALL MY LIFE ♪ ♪ I'M DONE WAITING ♪ ♪ THROW ME A SIGN ♪ Phil: I DON'T KNOW. I'M PLAYING IT ALL BY EAR, AND I'M JUST LIVING BY THE MINUTE NOW, OR BY THE HOUR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. ♪ I DON'T KNOW, LORD ♪ ♪ I NEED YOUR HELP TO GET ME THROUGH SOME CHANGE ♪ ♪ MOVE ALONG ♪ ♪ TO GET ALONG ♪ Narrator: FINALLY, AT THE END OF HIS ROPE, HE SWALLOWS HIS PRIDE AND ASKS HIS FELLOW CAPTAINS FOR ADVICE. NO RESPONSE. HE REACHES OUT TO A SURE BET. FISHING A MERE 20 MILES TO THE NORTH, WIZARD CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN IS AVERAGING 50 CRAB A POT. BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO BROADCAST HIS HOT SPOT. YOU GOT IT ON HERE, MAN? Keith: PHIL? I DON'T KNOW PHIL WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY SAY HOW PHIL FISHES. I KNOW HE'S DONE REALLY WELL IN THE PAST. HE'S GOT A LOT OF RADIOS. AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. Narrator: THE SILENCE IS DEAFENING. [ STATIC ] ♪ OH, MY GOODNESS ♪ ♪ GIVE ME A SIGN ♪ BETRAYED BY HIS BROTHERS, CAPTAIN PHIL HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO BLINDLY SPLASH ALL 180 POTS. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Narrator: COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH," A FATHER/SON SHOWDOWN. I DON'T WANT TO GET FULLY INVOLVED WITH THIS BOAT AND THEN DECIDE FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THAT THERE'S SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITY. Narrator: FISHING 217 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTHWESTERN IS 26 HOURS INTO A BACKBREAKING SHIFT. THE CREW'S WORKED WITHOUT A BREAK, SURVIVING SOLELY ON NICOTINE... AND COFFEE. COME ON. AND WITH CAPTAIN SIG DOUBLING DOWN, 300 POTS ARE SPLIT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS 50 MILES APART. OH, BOY! HO HO HO! YEAH! YEAH! WHOA HO HO! NOW, FISHING IS A 24/7 OPERATION. YES! Man: WHOO! LOOK AT THIS! BIG MONEY, BABY! I GOT LATTES FOR A MONTH NOW! [ LAUGHS ] HEY, WATCH OUT. THAT'S NICE CRAB, MAN. THAT'S SOME NICE-LOOKING CRAB. GOOD-LOOKING STUFF. IT'S THE A-LIST. WHOA HO! THAT ONE'S WORTH A CIGARETTE. LOOK AT THAT BIG BAD BOY. Narrator: THE CREW IS DOG TIRED. EVEN DECK BOSS EDGAR IS SHOWING SIGNS OF FATIGUE. YEAH! THANK YOU. JUST GETTING WARMED UP. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT YOU GET! EDGAR MISSED ON THE HOOK THREE TIMES. I SEEN EDGAR MISS A COUPLE TIMES JUST NOW, AND I DIDN'T EVEN THINK IT WAS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. HE DOESN'T MISS THAT OFTEN. IT'S KIND OF FUNNY. ON MY WORST DAY, I'M STILL BETTER THAN THAT GUY. THREE TIMES IN A ROW! Narrator: ALTHOUGH THE CREW IS READY FOR A BREAK, SIG WANTS TO FISH. Sig: WE'RE HERE. WE'RE READY TO ROLL. I'M SEEING CRAB IN MY POTS, SO... THAT'S THE PRIORITY HERE -- CRAB, WEATHER, FOOD. [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S GOOD. OH, YEAH, AND THERE'S SLEEP. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT. THAT'S ON THE BOTTOM SOMEWHERE. I'D RATHER JUST WORK UNTIL MY EYES POP OUT OF MY HEAD, THEN SLEEP. GUARANTEE YOU HE'S GONNA SNAP BEFORE I DO. GUARANTEE. QUITE HONESTLY, THE LONGER YOU WORK, THE BETTER I FEEL. Narrator: 100 MILES SOUTH OF THE CRAB GROUNDS, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN OF THE TIME BANDIT HEADS INTO DUTCH HARBOR FOR THEIR FIRST OFF-LOAD OF THE SEASON. WE'RE DROPPING OFF ABOUT 70,000 POUNDS OUR FIRST LITTLE TRIP. Scott: IT LOOKS EXCELLENT FOR US. I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS TANK FULL OF RED CRAB BEFORE. Newberry: IT'S AN EXCITING DAY FOR US TODAY BECAUSE WE GET TO OFF-LOAD, AND WE ACTUALLY GET TO GET SOME -- PUT SOME MONEY IN THE BANK. IT'S NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY SELL THE LITTLE CRITTERS. Man: YEAH! AHA! HO HO HO! GO GET MORE. HO! HO HO HO! I SEE CRAB IN THERE. 1,468 ON THAT ONE. Narrator: WHILE MOST OF THE CREW DREAMS OF CASHING IN, JOHNATHAN'S SON SCOTTY, A NEW DAD HIMSELF, IS HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER HE'S CUT OUT FOR THE CRABBING LIFE. SO, SCOTTY PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME, DUDE, THAT HE JUST WANTS TO DO IT FOR THE MONEY AND HE'S NOT REALLY WANTING TO FISH. I SAID, "COOL. LONG AS WE KNOW THAT." LONG AS HE'S A GOOD CREW MEMBER. IF HE'S NOT A GOOD CREW MEMBER, [BLEEP] HIM. JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE MY KID DON'T MEAN YOU GOT A JOB. RIGHT? JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE MY KID DON'T MEAN YOU GOT A [BLEEP] JOB. I KNOW THAT. YOU JUST GOT TO WORK HARD. WHO SAID THAT? IF YOU DIDN'T DO HERRING, SALMON, EVERYTHING, YOU'RE [BLEEP] GONE. I'M TRYING TO DO THE BEST THING I CAN. I'M TRYING TO BE A [BLEEP] DAD. THAT'S WHAT I DID. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, IT SUCKED THAT YOU WERE NEVER AROUND. SO I'M TRYING TO BE AROUND. IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND, YOU'D HAVE BEEN HEARING FIGHTING ALL THE TIME. I KNOW. MAKE SOME MONEY RIGHT NOW, WE'LL HELP YOU OUT. YOU GOT THE FAMILY LIFE. I DON'T WANT TO GET FULLY INVOLVED WITH THIS BOAT AND THEN DECIDE FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THAT THERE'S SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITY, AND THEN YOU GUYS GET ALL PISSED OFF AT ME. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE THING, WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND FIVE YEARS PAYING YOU MONEY AND THEN NOT HAVE YOU BE INVOLVED. I DON'T WANT TO GET FULLY INVOLVED IN THIS BOAT -- YOU LOOK OUT FOR THIS BOAT FIRST. YOU HEAR ME? DO YOU HEAR ME? YEAH, I HEAR YOU. Narrator: FOR SCOTTY, FOLLOWING IN HIS FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS MAY COME AT TOO HIGH A COST. I DON'T WANT TO BE [BLEEP] 55 YEARS OLD, NO RETIREMENT, NO [BLEEP] BENNIES, NO NOTHING, GOING "[BLEEP] I'M A CRAB FISHERMAN." I'LL BE ONE OF THOSE GUYS IN THE [BLEEP] BAR -- MY FAMILY'S LEFT ME, MY [BLEEP] KIDS HATE ME, AND I'M GOING [BLEEP] AND ALL I HAVE IS [BLEEP] DRUNKEN BAR STORIES TO TELL PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY. I WANT TO BE [BLEEP] SUCCESSFUL. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND BE SOMEBODY. EVERYBODY SAYS IT'S ABOUT MONEY OUT HERE. IT'S A WAY OF LIFE. WELL, IT AIN'T ABOUT LOVE. IT'S SAD. [ SCOFFS ] Narrator: JOHNATHAN'S SON JUST COMPLETED HIS FIRST FISHING TRIP SINCE HE WAS 22, AND ALREADY THE PRESSURE IS ON TO COMMIT TO A LIFETIME. Scott: EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID, I'VE BEEN OUT HERE FISHING, HANGING OUT, ME BEING A PART OF THE BOYS. I THINK SCOTT'S DOING GREAT. HE STARTED OUT A LITTLE BIT SLOW. BUT, MAN, HE'S JUST RACKING. HE'S RIPPING THE BUOYS RIGHT THROUGH THE BLOCK. YEAH, BABY. A LOT OF GRINDING BAIT, A LOT OF HAULING, LOT OF SETTING, LOT OF STACKING. A LONG WAYS TO GO. IT'S A CRAZY LIFE, THAT'S FOR SURE. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO DRAG THEM THROUGH IT OR NOT. WHAT'S ALL THAT MONEY WORTH IF YOU CAN'T ENJOY IT WITH YOUR FAMILY? IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT ME ANYMORE. Narrator: FOR JOHNATHAN, DREAMS OF KEEPING THE 80-YEAR HILLSTRAND LEGACY ALIVE ARE FADING FAST. BUT HIS SON HAS ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND. THEY DON'T REALLY NEED ME. THINK THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT WITHOUT ME. ALL I AM IS MONEY OUT OF THEIR POCKETS. Johnathan: SO YOU'RE TAKING OFF? YEP, I'M OUT OF HERE. I'VE GOT A PLANE TO CATCH. GOT A HALF-HOUR TO GET THERE. GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. LOVE YOU, MAN. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF OUT HERE. THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. AND, UH... SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME. [ DOOR CLOSES ] LOVE YOU, MAN. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF OUT HERE. THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. AND SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME. [ DOOR CLOSES ] Narrator: FOR JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND, THIS SEASON WILL BE REMEMBERED BY SECOND CHANCES. WHEN HIS SON SCOTTY JOINED THE BOAT, HE WAS GIVEN THE CHANCE TO BE A DAD AGAIN. Johnathan: I HAVEN'T SPENT THIS MUCH TIME WITH MY KID IN A LONG TIME. I SEE HIM A DAY HERE, FOR DINNER THERE. I DON'T SEE HIM MUCH ANYMORE. IT'S PRETTY NICE. LAST TIME I HAD HIM OUT ON THE BOAT, WE GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP, DID A LOT OF TALKING. SO PRETTY GOOD -- PRETTY COOL SEEING MY KID. Narrator: IT WAS THREE DAYS BEFORE THE SEASON. THE TIME BANDIT BOYS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN BETTER SPIRITS. FORTUNE WAS ON THE HORIZON, AND THE FAMILY WAS UNITED. [ LAUGHING ] Man: ALLOWED TO HAVE FISTFIGHTS? Long: WE'RE HAVING OUR HALLOWEEN PARTY TONIGHT. WHO KNOWS WHEN WE'RE GONNA BE BACK, YOU KNOW. SO JOHNATHAN APPARENTLY BROUGHT UP A PLETHORA OF COSTUMES. I LIKE THE TRASH-CAN GUY. Narrator: JOHNATHAN'S PLAN WAS TO GET THE HILLSTRAND CLAN AND COMPANY SUITED UP, THEN HIT THE LOCAL PUB FOR SOME SELF-INFLICTED HUMILIATION. GOT TO WORK FOR AN HOUR OR YOU'RE FIRED. JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND. PUT A BIG TOWEL IN YOUR CROTCH OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHS ] FIRST THING I'M GONNA DO IS WALK IN, I'M GONNA HAND EACH WAITRESS $100 AND SAY, "SORRY FOR WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LAUGHING DOWN THERE. HEAR THEM. [ LAUGHING ] GET UP HERE [BLEEP] [ LAUGHING ] WAIT TILL YOU SEE EDDIE. OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU STUFF YOUR CROTCH? [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GONNA CRY. I'M GONNA CRY. YOU CAN ROB US OF OUR HALLOWEEN, BUT WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE IT ANYWAYS. THAT'S PERFECT, DUDE. DOUBLE-FISTED DRINKING TONIGHT. IT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS JOB IN THE WORLD. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THE MOTLEY TRICK-OR-TREATERS HEADED INTO TOWN, AND FOR THIS FAMILY REUNION, DRINKS WERE ON THE CAPTAIN. BUT WHEN JOHNATHAN WENT BACK TO THE BOAT TO RETRIEVE HIS WALLET, THINGS WENT SOUTH AND FAST. [ WATER SPLASHES ] Johnathan: MAN OVERBOARD! Man: YOU SEE HIM? I DON'T SEE HIM! WHERE'S HE AT?! Narrator: JOHNATHAN TOOK A NOSEDIVE BETWEEN THE DOCK AND THE STEEL BOAT. THE SKIPPER WAS TRAPPED IN 38-DEGREE WATER WEARING ONLY HIS HALLOWEEN COSTUME. A FIXED CAMERA ON THE DOCK CAPTURED THE ACTION. Man #2: LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO! I GOT HIM. WHOO! YOU NEVER DID THAT BEFORE. WHOO! GET THAT ON TAPE? I WAS UNDERWATER FOR LIKE A SECOND AND A HALF, PROBABLY. I SAW JOHN JUMP OUT AND THEN JUMP, BUT THEN THERE WAS NO JOHN ON THE BOAT. Johnathan: MAN OVERBOARD! YOU SEE HIM? I DON'T SEE HIM! WHERE'S HE AT?! SHEA SAW HIM DISAPPEAR. SHEA GOES, "HE FELL IN THE WATER," AND SHEA JUMPED OUT. AND THEN JOHNATHAN SAID, "MAN OVERBOARD." IF THAT WAS THE ARMY, I'VE NEVER DONE -- THAT'S A GOOD [BLEEP] LESSON. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT [BLEEP] KNOCK ON WOOD, MAN. Johnathan: I WENT UNDER, LIKE, THIS FAR. I HAD TO KICK LIKE FOUR TIMES TO GET BACK UP. I WAS HALFWAY UP THAT PILING -- YOU WENT TO STEP ON THIS ONE, YOU PUT YOUR FOOT THERE, 'CAUSE THERE'S YOUR BOOT MARK -- BOOM! I JUST WENT DOWN. AND THEN I JUST MISSED THIS. IT SUCKS DOWN THERE! THAT'S [BLEEP] UP! ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHAT WAS A HAPPY EVENT TURNED INTO A "GET YOUR [BLEEP] TOGETHER" EVENT. Narrator: CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN WAS COLD, SHAKEN, AND HUMILIATED, BUT LUCKY TO HAVE A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE. Andy: PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE -- THEY GO, "WHAT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS JOB ON A CRAB BOAT?" TRYING TO EVEN SET FOOT ON A CRAB BOAT'S A DANGEROUS JOB. Narrator: NOW WITH A NEWFOUND RESPECT FOR MORTALITY, JOHNATHAN FACES AN EVEN LARGER REALIZATION. HIS SON SCOTTY HAS CHOSEN A DIFFERENT LIFE. LITTLE GUY LEFT US. 275 MILES TO THE NORTH, CAPTAIN PHIL OF THE CORNELIA MARIE ARRIVES AT THE TOP OF HIS 25-POT STRING HE SET WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE GROUNDS AND ANY HELP FROM HIS FELLOW SKIPPERS. Phil: WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING HERE. IF THERE ISN'T, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'M GONNA DO. HOPEFULLY, SOMETHING HAPPENS RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. TWO CRAB. BARELY ENOUGH FOR A CRAB SALAD. Man: STILL LOOKING SAD. Narrator: IF THE MEAGER POTS CONTINUE, THE DELIVERY WILL BE SHORT 30,000 POUNDS, AND PHIL'S PAYOUT WILL BARELY COVER FUEL EXPENSES, MEANING MORE TIME GRINDING ON LOUSY FISHING. 6 LONELY CRABS. I CAN [BLEEP] COUNT THEM. I CAN NAME THEM. AT ABOUT AN 18-HOUR SOAK, WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY KIND OF NUMBERS AT ALL. SO THIS AREA'S DEAD. WE NEED TO GET SQUARED AWAY, GET ON SOME CRAB NOW. Narrator: THE CORNELIA MARIE'S FIRST 25-POT STRING HAS PUT ON LESS THAN 100 CRAB. IT'S HEARTBREAKING, YOU KNOW, TO SPEND ALL THAT TIME AND EFFORT AND... YOU GOT TO JUST DO THE BEST YOU CAN DO, AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE PERFORMED LIKE I SHOULD HAVE. Narrator: PHIL'S OLDEST SON, JOSH, HEADS TO THE WHEELHOUSE TO CHECK IN ON DAD. EVERY POT THAT YOU SET CAN'T BE FILLED TO THE TOP. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? YEAH. GENERALLY, THAT'S HAPPENED, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- TOMORROW'S GONNA BE A GOOD DAY. I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING. IT'S GONNA BRING US SOME LUCK. [ RAZOR WHIRRING ] THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN OFFERING TO THE CRAB GODS. SO THERE BETTER BE SOME CRABS IN OUR POTS WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. HAVING AN ENGINEER CUT MY HAIR IN 20-PLUS SEAS. Narrator: JOSH'S HOPE IS THAT HIS SACRIFICE WILL STUFF THE TANKS WITH CRAB BEFORE HIS DAD SELF-DESTRUCTS FROM STRESS. [ THUDDING ] THAT TOOK SOME OFF, RIGHT THERE. OOPS. WHAT? WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED OVER HERE? WHO'S NEXT? IF THIS GETS US ON THE CRAB, WE'LL MAKE THIS A SEASON RITUAL. IF IT DOESN'T, I'M GONNA BE PISSED AT THE CRAB GODS. YES, BABY! RIGHT ON. Narrator: COMING UP... THROW AN EXTRA BAG IN THESE POTS. ...A GREENHORN MUTINY... WHAT MOI MIGHT NOT REALIZE IS HE MIGHT BE BRINGING A WORLD OF PAIN ON HIMSELF. HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN HIS [BLEEP] ASS OUT RIGHT AWAY. Narrator: 300 MILES TO THE NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, CAPTAIN KEITH OF THE WIZARD NEARS THE END OF THE 55-POT MAN-KILLER STRING. ABOUT 9 MILES' WORTH OF JUST PURE HAULING GEAR, START TO FINISH. BY THE TIME YOU'RE DONE, YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED A TON OF WORK, BUT THE GUYS ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAT TO HELL. MY LEFT HAND IS... REALLY HURTING PRETTY BAD. Leveen: EXHAUSTION. YOU FIND THAT WALL AND YOU BEAT AGAINST IT, YOU KNOCK IT DOWN UNTIL THE NEXT ONE COMES. HUSTLE UP, KID! WHAT ARE WE DOING OUT THERE? JASON -- HE'S KIND OF RUNNING AROUND, STILL, WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF. Man: GET IT! GOOD! DEAD FISH AND LOTS OF CRAB. Narrator: AFTER A BACKBREAKING TWO-DAY GRIND, JASON MOI IS BARELY HANGING ON. Moilanen: SOPER SHOWS ME ONE WAY TO DO SOMETHING -- MONTE COMES DOWN AND SHOWS ME ANOTHER WAY TO DO THE SAME [BLEEP] THING. WOULD I RATHER MOI NOT COMPLAIN? YEAH, I'D RATHER HEAR NOTHING. I'D RATHER HE JUST SHUTS UP AND DOES THE WORK. I'M COLD, SWEATY, SOAKING WET. I'M BARELY HOLDING ON AS WE'RE SPEAKING RIGHT NOW. SO... I THINK THERE'S A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY THAT MOI MAY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. HE'S GONNA GET THROUGH IT, BUT IS HE GONNA TRY AND GET THROUGH THE WHOLE THING, OR IS HE JUST GONNA TRY AND GET THROUGH THIS TRIP? I DON'T KNOW. Narrator: WITH JUST 15 POTS LEFT, MOI IS BONE TIRED, A ZOMBIE, JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS. NOT A GOOD IDEA ON THE DECK OF A CRAB BOAT. WATCH YOUR HANDS. [ CLANGS ] SO GLAD THIS SET'S DONE. MY HAND... HURTS. Narrator: ON THE STEAM BACK TO HIS FIRST STRING, KEITH GOES TO THE GALLEY TO CHECK ON HIS GREENHORN. YEAH. HEY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT FINGER, MAN. YOU NEED TO RELIEVE THAT PRESSURE ON THAT THING. IT'S GETTING WORSE BY THE MINUTE. IT'S A NASTY BASH BUT NOTHING SPECIAL ON A CRAB BOAT. HIS ENTIRE BACK'S JUST A BUNCH OF DOTS AND BRUISES. THAT'S NOT NEW. NOPE. [ LAUGHING ] EVERY TRIP, GUYS GET BANGED UP OUT HERE. LITTLE BRUISES. EVERY TRIP, SOMEBODY HAS SOMETHING. Narrator: KEITH HAS A REMEDY FOR MOI'S FINGER, BUT IT WON'T BE PRETTY OR PAINLESS. IT'S BARELY GETTING RED, MAN. YOU WANT THAT THING TO JUST BE WHITE HOT. OW! THERE YOU GO. THAT'LL DO IT. [ INHALING SHARPLY ] YEAH, GET THAT OUT OF THERE. WHOA! AHH! YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO IT AGAIN. GIVE HER ANOTHER SQUEEZE. AHH. BET THAT FEELS GOOD NOW, DOESN'T IT? WELL, NOT YET, BUT IT WILL. Narrator: MOI HAS YET TO IMPRESS THE SKIPPER WITH HIS DECK WORK, BUT HE DOES PROVE HE MAY HAVE SOME GUTS. [ SQUISHING ] RIGHT ON, MAN. YOU'RE A TOUGH GUY. THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE. SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU A SHOT OF WHISKEY FIRST. FIRST TRIP'S ALWAYS THE HARDEST. AND THE FIRST YEAR'S GONNA BE YOUR HARDEST YEAR. AND AFTER THAT, IT JUST GETS EASIER. THE WORK DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER, THE DAYS DON'T GET ANY SHORTER, BUT AS YOU LEARN WHAT YOU NEED TO DO OUT THERE AND YOU START TO WORK WITH THE OTHER GUYS, IT JUST GETS EASIER. JASON'S REAL TEST WILL COME IN 24 HOURS WHEN THEY GO THROUGH ALL 300 POTS AGAIN. Narrator: 217 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR... THE NORTHWESTERN'S DECK IS NOW 39 HOURS WITHOUT A BREAK. AND CAPTAIN SIG HAS NO PLANS OF STOPPING. Sig: WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THESE POTS. I DON'T CARE WHAT. AND I KNOW THE GUYS ARE GONNA WANT A NAP. I CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THESE POTS, AND IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS, AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. Narrator: AND, TO BOOT, SIG IS TAKING EDGAR'S CHALLENGE PERSONALLY AND WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO PROVE THE SKIPPER CAN'T BE OUTWORKED. THREE HOURS LATER, THE CREW IS BARELY HANGING ON. Edgar: SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. JUST GO NUMB AND... POT TO POT TO POT. YOU'RE JUST A ROBOT -- PERIOD. Narrator: BUT IN THE WHEELHOUSE, SIG IS FADING FAST AND LOOKING FOR EDGAR TO CRY UNCLE. ARE YOU STILL MOTIVATED? [BLEEP] STUPID. EDGAR'S JUST BEING A [BLEEP] HE'S ASKING US IF WE'RE TIRED TO JUSTIFY HIM GOING TO BED. I'M HANDLING IT VERY WELL. IF HE'S NOT TIRED, THEY'RE GONNA ALL GET IT. FINE. HE'S GETTING TIRED. HE'S GETTING MAD. HE'S GONNA HAVE A CONNIPTION FIT PROBABLY ABOUT 10 MINUTES. YEAH. HE'S SO STUPID. GOT THE BRAINS OF A [BLEEP] PEA. Narrator: WITH SIG SHOWING SIGNS OF BREAKING, THE DECK BEGINS ANOTHER ALL-NIGHT RALLY. THE SUN RISES, AND THE TIME BANDIT IS FINISHED WITH HER OFF-LOAD, BUT THEY'RE ONE CREW MEMBER DOWN. SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME. [ DOOR CLOSES ] LAST NIGHT, JOHNATHAN'S SON SCOTTY DECIDED TO JUMP SHIP. Johnathan: SCOTT JUST CAME OUT TO PROVE HIMSELF. WE HATE HIS GUTS, BUT, YEAH, IT'S COOL. IT'S COOL. YOU ALWAYS HATE SOMEBODY WHEN THEY FLY HOME, BUT... Long: WE'RE SHORT A GUY ON DECK NOW. SCOTT'S LEFT. THE WEEKEND-WARRIOR FISHERMAN. SO, YEAH, NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER -- WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO PICK UP THE EXTRA SLACK, AND IT SUCKS, MAN. IT PUTS US SHORTHANDED ON DECK. NOT THAT WE CAN'T COVER IT, YOU KNOW? Narrator: ADDING INJURY TO INSULT, EDDIE'S WORKED ALL SEASON LONG ON A BAD ANKLE, AND NOW IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD, HE'S BARELY ABLE TO WALK. SEE IF WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM TO THE CLINIC. HOW'S THE FOOT COMING? YOU FEEL THAT? AAH! [ Chuckling ] YOU FEEL THAT? AH. YEAH. WALK ON IT FOR ME. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. ALL RIGHT, HOPPY. Narrator: WITH JUST FOUR HOURS BEFORE STEAMING TO THE CRAB GROUNDS, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN TAKES EDDIE TO THE EMERGENCY CLINIC FOR AN X-RAY. IF IT'S BROKEN... I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. Johnathan: YEAH, HE'S TOUGH. HE WON'T EVEN SAY HE HURTS. BUT HE DON'T WANT TO LOSE HIS JOB, EITHER. NO, I DON'T. YOU HAVE A LOT OF PAIN? YEAH, IT'S -- YEAH. IT'S JUST SORE. EVEN HIS TOES ARE BRUISED. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BAD IF THE TOES -- ALL THE TOES ARE BLACK AND BLUE, THE ANKLE. PRETTY SWOLLEN, HUH? ANYTHING UP HERE THAT BOTHERS YOU? WAS THERE ANY NUMBNESS OR TINGLING AT ALL? NO, JUST IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN. SIT DOWN ON TOP OF THAT TABLE, PLEASE. Uwekoolani: I'M 42 YEARS OLD. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE YEARS I CAN DO THIS. I'LL HAVE TO RETIRE, WHICH I'M NOT READY TO. STILL YOUNG AT HEART. Narrator: EDDIE WANTS TO FISH, BUT WORKING ON DECK WITH A SERIOUS INJURY COULD PUT HIM AND THE OTHER GUYS AT RISK. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS. YOU GOT TO DO WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS. Narrator: WITH SCOTTY GONE, JOHNATHAN IS QUICKLY RUNNING OUT OF DECKHANDS. A WEEK AGO, WE HAD TOO MANY. NOW WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU HAVE A CHIP OFF OF YOUR ANKLE. I DON'T KNOW. YOU SHOULD RAISE YOUR HAND. I WANT TO PUT YOU IN A CAST BOOT, AND I'M GONNA TALK TO THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST. BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE DONE THIS, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN, OKAY? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. EDDIE'S CHOICE IS TOUGH -- LOSE THE REST OF THE SEASON OR MAYBE THE REST OF HIS FISHING CAREER. JUST HOPE IT DON'T [BLEEP] ME UP FOR OPIES. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR WHAT JOHN'S GONNA SAY. I KNOW WHAT HE'LL SAY. "YOU GOT TO GO HOME." I DON'T WANT TO. HE HAS THE ULTIMATE CHOICE. HE'S MY SKIPPER, SO... [ GRUNTS ] I DO HAVE A FRACTURE. A SMALL ONE. SMALL FRACTURE. OKAY. SO WHAT'D THE DOCTOR SAY? TAKE -- DON'T USE YOUR FOOT. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU CAN GO OUT ON DECK WITH THAT, DOES IT? Johnathan: I'M CONCERNED FOR EDDIE THAT HE DOESN'T GET HURT ANY WORSE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM GO HOME AND NOT FISH. SO I GOT TO TALK WITH MY BROTHERS, BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA KEEP HIM ON THE BOAT. HE CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS. I HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS. Narrator: COMING UP ON "DEADLIEST CATCH," A GREENHORN'S SACRIFICE IS TESTED, AS WELL AS A SKIPPER'S WILLPOWER. [BLEEP] WITH FULL POTS AND A TIRED CREW, THE NORTHWESTERN IS GAINING ON THE WIZARD'S NUMBERS. Narrator: 217 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, ON THE NORTHWESTERN, A BATTLE OF WILLS BETWEEN TWO BROTHERS RAGES ON. THE CREW'S BEEN GRINDING FOR 47 STRAIGHT HOURS IN A CONTEST FOR LAST MAN STANDING -- CAPTAIN SIG... QUITE HONESTLY, THE LONGER YOU WORK, THE BETTER I FEEL. ...OR LITTLE BROTHER EDGAR. GUARANTEE YOU HE'S GONNA SNAP BEFORE I DO. THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME, YOU KNOW? WE'VE BEEN GOING FOR A WHILE. SURE, WE'RE ALL A LITTLE TIRED. LITTLE ZOMBIE LAND. NOT SURE WHAT SIG'S GONNA DO. STUPID. Narrator: THE CREW MAY BE AT THE END OF THEIR ROPE, BUT THEY REFUSE TO LET SIG GET THE BEST OF THEM. ANIMAL FISHING. [ Slurring ] I JUST... I DON'T KNOW. ROBOT. DEFINITELY ROBOT TIME RIGHT NOW. THAT'S FINE. EDGAR CAN STAY OUT THERE AND [BLEEP] FREEZE FOR ALL I GIVE A [BLEEP] [ LAUGHING ] JUST TO BE DIFFERENT AND STUBBORN. LAST TWO POTS WAS 48 AND 58. Edgar: ACT A LITTLE MORE EXCITED NOW, WILL YOU? I AM EXCITED. DUDE, LAST TWO POTS WAS 48 AND 58! 60! AAH! Narrator: FINALLY, AFTER NODDING OFF, SIG ASKS FOR A TRUCE. COME ON, YOU DIRTY...
