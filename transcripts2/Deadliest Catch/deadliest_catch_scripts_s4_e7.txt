 OH-HO-HO! FOR OTHERS, IT'LL BE A BITTER FIGHT TO THE FINISH. WE'RE NEVER GOING HOME. Narrator: THE MEN ARE PUSHED TO THE BRINK, FACING KILLER WAVES... NOW, THERE'S A BIG ONE COMING HERE. Man: WHOA-HO-HO-HO! AND THE TENSION ON DECK IS READY TO EXPLODE... YOUR BROTHER'S [BLEEP] LOOPY, MAN! ...BEFORE THEIR FINAL OFF-LOAD... WOW! ...OF THE DEADLIEST CATCH. HANG ON.

 THE NORTH AMERICAN PLIES THROUGH HEAVY SEAS TRYING TO HUNT DOWN THEIR GEAR. I'M LOOKING FOR THE FIRST POT HERE IN THE STRING. THEY'RE REALLY SPREAD OUT, AND THEY'VE BEEN SO FRUSTRATING. Narrator: SKIPPER STEN SKAAR IS DOWN TO JUST 10 DAYS TO FILL HIS QUOTA. BUT TRACKING DOWN HIS POTS AT NIGHT IS A SHOT IN THE DARK. Sten: THE LIGHTING ON THIS BOAT, I KIND OF FORGOT, IT'S AWFUL. YEAH. IT'S PRETTY DARK, ISN'T IT, ERIC? Eric: YEAH. Narrator: MOST BOATS IN THE FLEET ARE EQUIPPED WITH POWERFUL SODIUM FORWARD LIGHTS, BUT NOT THE NORTH AMERICAN. EVEN WITH GPS, IN THE DARK, IT'S EASY TO MISS BUOYS BY JUST A MATTER OF YARDS. Sten: 56°56'. 56°56'32". THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE BOW THERE. IS THAT A BUOY? THAT'S A DUCK. THERE IT IS. IT'S COMING OUT. OH, YEAH, THERE YOU GO. MISS! THAT SUCKS. WORKING ALL THE BUGS OUT. I MISSED A POT. NOW I GOT TO TURN AROUND AND GO BACK. Narrator: WITH ONLY 27,000 POUNDS OF CRAB ON BOARD, CAPTAIN STEN STILL NEEDS 22,000 MORE TO FILL HIS TANKS. IT'S AWFUL TO BE LATE, YOU KNOW? IT'S ALWAYS CATCH-UP, AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH UP. Man: HERE IT COMES. OH, WOW. WE GOT SOMETHING HERE! Man #2: OH, YEAH! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Narrator: AFTER SPENDING THEIR FIRST FOUR DAYS OUT PULLING BLANKS, OPTIMISM IS CREEPING UP ON THE CREW. THIS POT IS HALF FULL. LOOKS GOOD. LOOKS GOOD. COMING OVER. READY? OVER. 39! AWESOME. WE GOT 39, ALMOST 40 ON THE FIRST. THAT'S GREAT. Narrator: THEY'VE LANDED ON THE CRAB. THE CHALLENGES FOR THE DECKHANDS, HOWEVER, ARE JUST STARTING. Arket: WE'RE A LITTLE RUSTY RIGHT NOW. WE'RE STILL GETTING INTO THE WORK OF THINGS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. KIND OF NERVE-RACKING, THAT'S FOR SURE. Man: GOT TO GET A SYSTEM DOWN. EVERYONE'S NEW TO THIS BOAT, SO YOU GOT TO GET ONE. WE DON'T HAVE ONE YET. CRAZY OUT HERE. Narrator: IT'S BEEN A LONG THREE-YEAR OFF-SEASON FOR THE CREW. THEY NEED TO FIND A RHYTHM. AND MAKING THE JOB ON DECK EVEN TOUGHER -- THEY'RE WORKING WITHOUT A CRUCIAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. WE'RE USING TOTES RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE WE SOLD OUR TABLE. SO IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT. HAVE TO MAKE A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT. Narrator: WITHOUT A TABLE, THE DECKHANDS FACE HOURS OF BENDING, STOOPING, AND SORTING. AND AS THE WEATHER PICKS UP... John: WATCH THE TOTE! ...THEY NEED TO CONSTANTLY DODGE SLIDING TOTES, ESPECIALLY THE ONES STUFFED WITH HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF CRAB. Man: THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT GETS DANGEROUS WHEN THESE THINGS ARE CHOKED FULL OF CRAB, TOO, AND YOU'RE IN ROUGH WEATHER. TURN YOUR BACK ON THEM FOR A SECOND, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY COME SLIDING UNDERNEATH YOU, TAKE YOUR KNEES RIGHT OFF. John: HEADS UP. HE'S DOING THAT SO THE TOTES DON'T SLIDE. THAT'S WHAT ERIC'S DOING. Narrator: HEAVY SEAS, LOUSY LIGHTING, AND RUNAWAY TOTES ON DECK. THIS OUT-OF-PRACTICE CREW WILL NEED A MIRACLE TO FILL THEIR QUOTA AND GO HOME VICTORIOUS. FISHING, MAN. GOT TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD. THAT'S FISHING, YOU KNOW. Narrator: 43 MILES TO THE SOUTH OF THE NORTH AMERICAN, THE SUN RISES OVER THE WIZARD. [ BIRDS SCREECHING ] HOPING TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE BEFORE THE REST OF THE FLEET, CAPTAIN KEITH LAID OUT A 60-POT HAIL MARY ON GROUNDS HE HASN'T FISHED IN FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS. WE'RE IN STRIKING DISTANCE OF HAVING THIS THING WRAPPED UP. WE GOT 168,000 POUNDS. WE GOT ABOUT, HOPEFULLY, 80,000 SITTING IN THE GEAR. WE WANT TO TRY AND GET IN AND OUT OF HERE. Narrator: AND THE GAMBLE COULD COME AT A PAINFUL PRICE. THE GEAR IS SET IN AN AREA KNOWN AROUND THE FLEET AS "THE SLIME BANK." THERE'S NOTORIOUSLY BAD JELLYFISH RIGHT THROUGH THIS AREA. IN THE LATE '80s, THERE WAS PHENOMENAL CRAB FISHING GOING ON HERE. FIRST BUOY RIGHT HERE. WHERE'S YOUR SPOT? IT'S GONNA BE OUR NEW SPOT. MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. THIS IS EITHER GONNA BE A HERO SHOT OR A ZERO SHOT. I WANT THESE STRINGS TO SHOW, YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF FISHERMAN I AM. AIN'T GOT [BLEEP] WHAT THE [BLEEP] A [BLEEP] EMPTY POT. OHH, WOW. THERE AREN'T ANY CRAB HERE. THAT HURTS! ZERO! FIRST BLANK OF THE YEAR. TOTALLY BLANK. IT'S NOT GOOD. ANYTHING IN IT? SON OF A... Leveen: CURRENTLY, THIS IS OUR THIRD GOOSE EGG. SO PROSPECTS DON'T LOOK GOOD. Narrator: FOR MOST OF THE SEASON, THE WIZARD HAS PULLED HIGH NUMBERS. NOW THE GREENHORNS ARE GETTING A LESSON IN WHY THEIR OCCUPATION IS CALLED "FISHING" NOT "CATCHING." WE'RE JUST PICKING EMPTY POTS. IT SUCKS. IT SUCKS BAD. JUST BACKBREAKING WORK FOR NOTHING RIGHT NOW. YOU TRY TO NOT GET IT IN YOUR EYES AT ALL. IT STINGS REALLY BAD. NASTY STUFF. YOU GET THAT ALL OVER YOUR FACE, YOU'LL KNOW IT RIGHT AWAY. Keith: FIRST 12 POTS AND WE ARE OFF TO A BIG, BLAZING BLANK COUNT. ANOTHER BIG-MONEY POT. THE SLIME BANK LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT GONNA BE OUR BANK. WE'RE AT 19 POTS, AND WE'VE GOT 19 BLANKS. RIGHT NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE THE DECISION'S BEING MADE FOR ME THAT THIS GEAR'S GONNA COME ON, AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT BACK UP THE HILL. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND SOMEWHERE UP THE HILL, THOUGH, WHERE THE FLEET HASN'T REALLY HAMMERED YET. Narrator: STRIKING OUT THIS BIG IS A BLOW TO THE SKIPPER'S WALLET... ...AND A TOUGH HIT TO HIS EGO. Keith: I MEAN, I'M NOT COMPARING MYSELF TO ANYBODY THAT'S PLAYING A PROFESSIONAL SPORT, BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS. IT'S A SELECT GROUP OF GUYS, AND WE'RE DEFINITELY VERY COMPETITIVE. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO DO WELL EVERY TIME. ONE. Narrator: KEITH GIVES THE ORDER TO STACK ALL 60 POTS AND HEAD TO NEW GROUNDS. NASTY PLACE TO FISH. Narrator: COMING UP, MOTHER NATURE STRIKES. Johnathan: OH, LOOK AT THAT WAVE HE JUST GOT HIT BY. HE'S DOWN! Narrator: 270 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND OF THE TIME BANDIT IS ALSO TESTING OUT REMOTE, SELDOM-FISHED GROUNDS. I'VE SEEN THEM UP ON THE SIDE OF THIS HILL I SET. THIS IS ONE OF MY OLD SECRET HOT SPOTS WHERE THE STRING ENDS UP. SO I CAME HERE. HOPEFULLY, IT'S NOT A BLANK SPOT HERE. Narrator: THEY HAVE 36 HOURS TO CATCH 98,000 MORE POUNDS OF KING CRAB BEFORE HEADING IN FOR THEIR FINAL OFF-LOAD. THERE WAS NOBODY HERE BUT US. Narrator: THERE ARE NO OTHER BOATS IN SIGHT, BUT LAST NIGHT'S STORM BLEW AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR ON DECK. ENDED UP WITH US. BUSTED UP LIKE MOST OF US ON THIS BOAT. IS HE SAYING, "I WANT TO GO IN THE WATER"? YOU HEAR THE SOUND HE'S MAKING? I'D LEAVE HIM RIGHT THERE, JUST LET HIM BE NOW. I THINK HE'D BE BETTER IN THE WATER. THAT AIN'T THE WAY OF NATURE, MY FRIEND. I SAY LET HIM GO FREE WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THEY GOT PEOPLE IN KING COVE THAT'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM AND TRY TO FIX HIS WING AND SEND HIM BACK IN THE WILD. THEY'LL EAT HIM FOR, LIKE, SOUP. JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE. DON'T TOUCH HIM. DON'T TOUCH THE [BLEEP] WELL, HE WANTS THE BIRD TO SUFFER AND, LIKE, DIE A SLOW DEATH. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THE WATER? HE'LL BE WET. HE'S GONNA GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS, AND THAT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AROUND HERE. IF I FALL IN, WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME? THEY'RE GONNA EAT MY ASS! IF YOU BREAK YOUR LEG, I'M GONNA THROW YOU IN THE WATER. YEAH, IF I BREAK MY LEG -- YEAH, I WON'T TRY TO TAKE YOU TO TOWN, FIX YOUR LEG, AND THEN THROW YOU IN THE WATER, RELEASE YOU LATER. Narrator: CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN OVERRULES YOUNGER BROTHER ANDY. I'M GONNA LEAVE THE BIRD TO DIE A SLOW DEATH. CAPTAIN ANDY OUT. AND, AT LEAST FOR NOW, THE CORMORANT IS A WELCOME STOWAWAY ABOARD THE TIME BANDIT. Johnathan: BUT THE KARMA -- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? ARE YOU GONNA HELP HIM OUT? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? THAT'S KARMA. Narrator: ON DECK, A LITTLE GOOD KARMA MIGHT COME IN HANDY. THE CREW HAS 19 POTS TO PULL, AND THE WEATHER IS COMING UP FAST. IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU MY LEAST FAVORITE COLOR IN THE WHOLE WORLD. IT'S EVERYTHING OVER MY HEAD AND BETWEEN MY HANDS THAT WAY. IT'S CALLED ALEUTIAN GRAY, AND WE HATE IT. Narrator: THE BILLOWING, GRAY CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON ARE THE LEADING EDGE OF A STORM FRONT THAT WILL COLLIDE WITH THE TIME BANDIT IN A MATTER OF HOURS. BUT JOHNATHAN WILL KEEP FISHING UNTIL THE WEATHER SHUTS THEM DOWN. HOLD ON! HERE YOU GO, BUDDY. HERE'S SOME WATER FOR YOU. GOT TO GET SQUAWKY TO TOWN. SQUAWKY'S UNDER A DEADLINE. SQUAWKY MIGHT DIE. [ BIRDS SCREECHING ] I'LL BE GLAD WHEN THE WEATHER COMES DOWN. Narrator: WITH THE WIND AND WAVES ON THE RISE, JOHNATHAN DECIDES IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS ON DECK... FOR SQUAWKY. Jonathan: [ Chuckling ] HE'S WRITING HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OUT THERE. Narrator: HE'LL BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS. YOU WANT SOME FOOD? HERE'S SOME FOOD. HERE'S SOME MORE WATER. [ SQUAWKING ] HERE'S SOME WATER HERE. HERE YOU GO. HOW'S THE BIRD DOING? HE'S DOING OKAY. SQUAWKY IS DOING ALL RIGHT. HIS NAME'S SQUAWKY NOW? I THOUGHT IT WAS "WOODY." I GAVE SQUAWKY A NEW BOWL OF WATER, AND HE JUMPED IN IT AND SAT IN IT. SOUNDS LIKE A BIRD. YEAH, WE'RE SURFING NOW, BABY. SURFING A 114-FOOT SURFBOARD RIGHT HERE. [ LAUGHS ] THAT WAS... [ LAUGHS ] LITTLE SLIPPERY. THINGS TO TRIP OVER. SQUAWKY, HE'S NOT EATING. I JUST -- I DON'T CARE. I PUT HIM OUTSIDE SO HE HAS FRESH AIR AND IS NOT SO FREAKED OUT. OH, LOOK AT THAT WAVE HE JUST GOT HIT BY. HE'S DOWN! RUSS IS DOWN! [ LAUGHS ] HIS EYES WERE BIGGER THAN THOSE GLASSES, DUDE, WHEN HE WENT FLYING. [ LAUGHS ] HE WAS SLIDING DIAGONAL LIKE THIS, AND I JUST SEEN HIS HEAD GO BY THE TABLE. THE ROGUE CAME -- POW! -- HIT HIM -- RIGHT OUT OF NOWHERE. Johnathan: RUSSELL'S KILLING ME, MAN. I WOULDN'T BE LAUGHING EXCEPT HE'S NOT HURT OR NOTHING. I'M NOT EVIL, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: BY THE END OF THE STRING, THE TIME BANDIT PULLED ON 3,000 POUNDS OF CRAB. ALL RIGHT, BROTHER. WELL, WE LIVED THROUGH THAT ONE. AS THE CREW HEADS INSIDE TO REST AND RECOVER, JOHNATHAN HEADS OUTSIDE TO CHECK ON HIS NEW PET. I SEE HIS LITTLE BOX BACK THERE. SQUAWKY'S GONE. [ OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS ] HE'S NOT HERE. HE'S BEEN A PAIN IN OUR [BLEEP] ASS. FREELOADER. MOTHER NATURE PUT HIM HERE, AND THEN MOTHER NATURE TOOK HIM BACK. HOPEFULLY, HE'S HAPPY NOW, BUT HE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE SQUAWKING. PROBABLY OUT THERE BITCHING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, LIKE MOST OF US ON THIS BOAT. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS. Narrator: 195 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST, AFTER A 3-HOUR NAP, CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS IS BACK AT THE HELM OF THE 128-FOOT CORNELIA MARIE. WE GOT GEAR TO THE NORTH. WE GOT GEAR TO THE SOUTH. WE'RE KIND OF RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE. Narrator: THE FISHING ON PHIL'S SOUTHERN STRINGS HAS BEEN MEDIOCRE AT BEST. WHILE HE PLOTS A COURSE TO HEAD BACK UP THE HILL, DOWN IN THE GALLEY, HIS OLDEST SON, JOSH, DOES SOME PLOTTING OF HIS OWN. I WAS THINKING ABOUT MAKING A SANDWICH FOR THE OLD MAN 'CAUSE HE NEVER GETS OUT OF HIS CHAIR OR HAS TIME TO. HE NEEDS TO EAT SOMETHING BESIDE SMOKE CIGARETTES AND DRINK ENERGY DRINKS. Narrator: THIS SEASON, SINCE PHIL WON'T TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF, JOSH IS BUSTING HIS HUMP ON DECK AND PLAYING NURSE TO DEAR OLD DAD. ONCE WE GET THAT TAKEN CARE OF... CURRENTLY GETTING SOME ENERGY DRINKS FOR THE OLD MAN. YOU KNOW, EVERY POT THAT YOU SET CAN'T BE FILLED TO THE TOP. FIND US SOME DECENT CRAB IN OUR POTS WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. FOR YOU, BUDDY! I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT. AN EGG/SAUSAGE SANDWICH. NOT THE HEALTHIEST, BUT AT LEAST IT'S GOT EGG IN IT, SO... THAT'S ONE OF HIS FAVE SANDWICHES. AND HE'S PROBABLY NOT EXPECTING IT 'CAUSE HE NEVER PLANS ON EATING. IT'S LIKE A SICK DIET OF ENERGY DRINKS, CIGARETTES, AND COFFEE. THEN YOU THROW ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AND HE FEELS PRETTY GOOD. THEN HE'S EASIER ON US, SO IT'S KIND OF A WIN/WIN SITUATION. HE'S GOT TO EAT, OR ELSE HE GETS SICK. AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! THERE YOU GO. THAT'S FOR YOU. THANK YOU, BUDDY. IT'S NOT TOO GOURMET, BUT IT'LL BE UP YOUR ALLEY. JUST EAT SOMETHING. THANKS. YOU WANT A WATER OR ANYTHING? YEAH. PLEASE. Narrator: COMING UP... HEAVY SEAS... SOMEONE WILL GET KILLED IF I'M NOT WATCHING. ...AND DEADLY STEEL. Narrator: 270 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT IS TURNING AND BURNING, BANKING 35,000 POUNDS OF CRAB IN JUST 12 HOURS. SOMEONE WILL [BLEEP] GET KILLED IF I'M NOT WATCHING, YOU KNOW? SOMEONE WILL GET HURT OR SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN. Narrator: THE FISHING IS GOOD, BUT THE STORM FRONT THEY WERE KEEPING AN EYE ON EARLIER IS RIGHT BACK ON TOP OF THEM. Newberry: IT SEEMS OUR WEATHER HAS DETERIORATED. OUR WEATHER IS GETTING BAD. Johnathan: IF IT GETS ROUGH OUT, I CAN'T RUN AND GRAB SOMETHING TO DRINK OR EAT OR TAKE A PISS OR NOTHING, MAN. I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK OUT THAT BACK WINDOW, LIKE, IN GODSPEED. THE DECK'S REALLY SLIPPERY. YOU GOT TO WATCH OUT. IT CAN GET REAL DANGEROUS REAL QUICKLY. Man: HANG ON. ONE SLIP AND YOU'LL BE, LIKE, BROKEN ANKLE, KNOCK YOURSELF OUT, BREAK YOUR ARM ON THE WAY OUT. THIS IS A GOOD ONE. 61. WHOA! OH. Narrator: AS THE LAUNCHER RAISED UP, THE POT BROKE FREE, NEARLY CRUSHING THE CREW. THE DOG DIDN'T HOLD THE POT IN, AND THE POT FLIPPED OUT OF THE LAUNCHER. THAT'S WHEN GUYS GET HURT. WHOA! Narrator: DOGS ARE THE MECHANICAL HOOKS THAT SECURE THE POT TO THE LAUNCHER. WHEN THE DOGS FAIL, THE RESULT CAN BE FATAL. THAT COULD KILL A GUY RIGHT THERE, MY FRIEND. Narrator: COMPLICATING AN ALREADY VOLATILE MIX OF WORK AND WEATHER, THE TIME BANDIT'S ROOKIE, GREENHORN SHEA, IS WORKING THE RAIL. Man: THAT'S A MISS. STRIKE ONE. HE WAS JUST SAYING HOW HE WAS THE BEST. HANG ON. WATCH OUT.  WATCH OUT. WATCH OUT. BLOCK, MAN. THAT IS GREENHORN-MANEUVERABLE STUFF. WE GONNA HAUL SOME GEAR, OR ARE YOU GONNA DODGE THE WEATHER? AW, COME ON! Narrator: WITH THE SEASON DRAWING TO A CLOSE AND WICKED WEATHER TO CONTEND WITH... NEW PLAN. ...JOHNATHAN PUTS HIS MOST SEASONED DECKHAND ON THE HOOK. RUSSELL HASN'T MISSED A SHOT ALL SEASON. WHOO! COMING IN HOT! RUSSELL DOES NOT MISS. [ TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYS ] I'M STILL BETTER THAN HE IS, HANDS DOWN. Johnathan: EVERY THROW FOR RUSSELL IS LIKE LIFE-OR-DEATH. HE DON'T MISS. HE MAKES IT COUNT. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR -- A LOT OF GUYS. HE'LL MISS. [ LAUGHS ] Andy: YOU GOT TO BE ACCURATE 'CAUSE YOU'RE THROWING ABOUT A 5-POUND HOOK. RUSSELL'S THROWING PERFECT HOOK SHOTS. PULLING ON THEM BACKWARDS AND UPSIDE DOWN, HE'S STILL GONNA GET THE BLOCK. I HAVEN'T MISSED YET NOW. Johnathan: WELL, HERE'S A BACKWARDS ONE HERE. RUSSELL'S GONNA MISS. THIS IS THE LAST...LAST POT. [ CHEERING ] EVERYONE'S JUST CHEERING 'CAUSE HE JUST MISSED. OH, THAT MADE MY NIGHT. BUT, NO, HE DID NOT MISS! [ LAUGHS ] WHOO! TAKE THAT OVER THE RAIL, MAN. WHOO! RUSSELL'S A VETERAN. HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO AND WHEN TO DO IT, HOW TO DO IT THE EASIEST WAY, GET THE SAME JOB DONE IN THREE MOVES AS IT TAKES GUYS SIX, SEVEN MOVES. SHAKE AND BAKE. SHAKE AND BAKE. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: NEXT, THE FUTURE'S UNCLEAR FOR CAPTAIN PHIL. I'M JUST GETTING WORRIED ABOUT YOU, MAN. I WANT TO SEE YOU AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE. Narrator: WHILE THE  TIME BANDIT BOYS REST UP FROM HAULING IN BIG, STEADY CRAB, 75 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST ON THE CORNELIA MARIE, CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS' LUCK HAS ROLLER-COASTERED UP AND DOWN. NOW, AFTER WEEKS OF PROSPECTING, HE'S STILL TRYING TO DIAL IN TO STEADY NUMBERS. I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE ANSWERS. I'M JUST STRUGGLING TO DO THE BEST I CAN DO FOR US. YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT A MIND SCREW THIS JOB IS. I MEAN, YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF EVERY [BLEEP] THING, EVERYTHING ON THIS BOAT -- WHEN THEY EAT, WHEN THEY SLEEP, WHAT YOU CATCH, HOW MUCH YOU CATCH, WHERE YOU GO, WHAT YOU DO. THE WHOLE DAMN THING IS RIDING ON MY DECISIONS, ON EVERYTHING I DO. EVERYBODY WONDERS WHY I SMOKE LIKE A [BLEEP] CHOO-CHOO TRAIN. GEE, I WONDER WHY? Narrator: THE STRESS HAS TAKEN A TOLL ON PHIL'S NERVES AND HIS OVERALL HEALTH. I'VE FELT BETTER. I'M GETTING A COLD, YOU KNOW. SO I GOT A SORE THROAT. IT'S NOT FUN, BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. Narrator: WITH JUST 90,000 POUNDS OF CRAB ON BOARD, IT'S MAKE-OR-BREAK TIME AS PHIL NUDGES UP TO ANOTHER PROSPECT STRING. [ WHIRRING ] RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. WE'RE NOT TALKING JUST KEEPERS. WE'RE TALKING HUBCAPS, DUDE. OH, YEAH. GOLDEN. 94, BABY. THAT'S A GOOD POT. 94. THAT'S SWEET. YEAH! THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED FISHING! Narrator: THE GOOD NUMBERS BOOST SPIRITS ON DECK. BUT UP IN THE WHEELHOUSE, PHIL'S GOT A NEW DOSE OF STRESS FROM HIS PROCESSOR. BYE-BYE. [ RADIO SQUAWKS ] WELL, TODAY'S WEDNESDAY. THEY WANT ME IN THERE ON SATURDAY BEFORE NOON. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GONNA DO. Narrator: THE NUMBERS WILL HAVE TO HOLD FOR THE CORNELIA MARIE TO HAVE A PRAYER OF MAKING THEIR NEW OFF-LOAD DATE. AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! 96? SPREAD YOUR FINGERS  REALLY WIDE. SOMEBODY GRAB HIM AND [BLEEP]  CRANK ON YOUR [BLEEP] LIKE ELECTRICITY'S  RUNNING THROUGH YOUR BODY. SPREAD THE [BLEEP] FINGERS. JUST SPREAD YOUR [BLEEP]  FINGERS SO I CAN SEE. GIVE ME A FIVE.  DAVE DOES IT. WHY CAN'T YOU? IS IT A STRUGGLE  TO OPEN THEM FINGERS UP? GIVE ME A COUNT AGAIN. DAVE, GIVE ME THE [BLEEP]  SHOW HIM HOW TO DO THAT. SEE THIS?  SEE WHAT HE'S DOING? YOU LAME ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT? ♪ BABY, IT'S ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT ♪ ♪ THIS IS WHAT WORK YOU'VE GOT BY A DAMN SIGHT ♪ ♪ YOU KNOW IT WAS... ♪ ♪ SOMEONE'S COMING DOWN ♪ ♪ ANYONE ELSE COULD DO A DAMN SIGHT BETTER HERE AND NOW ♪ ♪ THIS IS ALL YOU'VE DONE BY A DAMN SIGHT ♪ WOULD YOU LIKE A BREAK? JUST A HALF HOUR. OKAY, BUDDY. THANKS. Narrator: AFTER 26 HOURS OF SITTING IN HIS CHAIR, PHIL HEADS DOWN TO HIS STATEROOM, HOPING TO GET SOME PEACE AND QUIET. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] WHAT'S GOING ON THERE, CHIEF? I HEARD YOU'RE NOT FEELING TOO WELL. I THINK I JUST GOT A COLD. IT'S PROBABLY ALL THIS CLEAN LIVING I'M DOING. CLEAN LIVING? YEAH. OH. YOU SMOKE LIKE IT'S GOING OUT OF STYLE, MAN. YOU'RE CONSTANTLY POUNDING BACK THE RED BULLS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY GALLONS OF COFFEE YOU DRINK A DAY. YOU HARDLY EVER EAT. I JUST GET WORRIED ABOUT YOU, MAN. THANKS FOR WORRYING. I WANT TO SEE YOU AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE. OH, I'LL BE AROUND FOR A WHILE. YEAH. I HOPE SO. ANYWAY, I'LL LET YOU GET SOME SNOOZE TIME IN, MAN. JUST MAKING SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. SEE, THIS IS NEW-SCHOOL VERSUS OLD-SCHOOL. OLD-SCHOOL, UNLESS, LIKE, YOU CAN'T MOVE AND SOMEONE'S GOT TO CARRY YOU TO THE DOCTOR, YOU KNOW, THEN THAT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU TYPICALLY GO. BUT, YOU KNOW, IN YOUR CASE, SOMEONE MIGHT BE CARRYING YOU IN A [BLEEP] CASKET TO THE DOCTOR IF YOU DON'T JUST GO CHECK YOURSELF OUT. IF I THINK I NEED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, I'LL GO. TYPICAL FISHERMAN. GET OUT OF HERE. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. Phil: HE'S A GREAT KID. BOTH OF THEM ARE. AND I KNOW THEY BOTH CARE. YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY DO. I CAN TELL IT'S GONNA TAKE SOMETHING DRASTIC IN HIS LIFE FOR HIM TO CHANGE HIS LIFESTYLE, BOTTOM LINE. Narrator: COMING UP... TENSION THREATENS TO END THE NORTH AMERICAN SEASON BEFORE IT STARTS. YOUR BROTHER'S [BLEEP] LOOPY, MAN! Narrator: 185 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTH AMERICAN PLOWS THROUGH 15-FOOT SEAS. CAPTAIN STEN SKAAR HAS DIVIDED HIS GEAR IN HOPES OF CONQUERING THE CRAB. TWO DIFFERENT AREAS, HAUL HALF THE GEAR A DAY. IF ONE AREA OUT-SEEDS THE OTHER, I CAN ALWAYS MOVE THE GEAR IN AND CONSOLIDATE. BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW IN THE BEGINNING, GET THINGS KIND OF SITUATED AND SPREAD OUT. Narrator: WITH ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT TO CATCH THEIR QUOTA, THE PRESSURE ON DECK IS INTENSE. YOU GOT THE LAUNCHER DOWN. LAUNCHER DOWN! IN ORDER TO GET THE NEXT POT IN THERE FAST ENOUGH, YOU NEED TO HAVE THE LAUNCHER DOWN SO IT DOESN'T SLIDE UNDERNEATH. I'LL STAND HERE AND HANG ONTO THE LINE TILL WE LET THE LAUNCHER DOWN IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY. GOOD. Narrator: WITH THE CLOCK TICKING AND UNDER HUGE PRESSURE FROM HIS FATHER, DECK BOSS JOHN WANTS TO SAVE TIME BY DROPPING THE LAUNCHER TO THE DECK AND PLACING THE NEXT POT BEFORE THE LINES AND BUOYS OF THE FALLING ONE CLEAR THE RAIL. WE'RE GONNA LET THE LAUNCHER DOWN NOW FOR JOHN. HE SEEMS TO THINK IT'S FASTER. I CAN'T SEE IT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE FASTER. SORRY. IT'S JUST A LITTLE FASTER. [BLEEP] Narrator: VETERAN DAVIN NESS' MAIN CONCERN IS SAFETY AND WANTS TO LEAVE THE LAUNCHER UP UNTIL THE LINES AND BUOYS OF THE FALLING POTS CLEAR THE DECK. YOU GOT TO GET THE POT IN BEFORE THE LAUNCHER'S DOWN. BRING THE LAUNCHER DOWN. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. BRING IT DOWN. A VERY SIMPLE -- SOMETHING THAT'S VERY SIMPLE. HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. WHAT? I HAVE NO IDEA. Sten: JOHN, MAYBE, IS FEELING A LITTLE INTIMIDATED, TOO, YOU KNOW? THERE'S VETERANS COMING ON THE BOAT, AND JOHN'S USUALLY BEEN THE MAIN GUY. AND YOU CAN LEARN FROM ANYBODY, YOU KNOW? NO ONE IS SELF-MADE. JUST FASTER THE WAY I SET IT. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO SHOW YOU WHEN I SET. OH, PLEASE DO. I WILL. THE GOD OF LINE. Man: MAKE SURE IT'S NEXT! WATCH WHAT THE [BLEEP] YOU'RE DOING. GET THAT [BLEEP] LAUNCHER UP. [BLEEP] FREAK. Narrator: DROPPING THE LAUNCHER CAN SAVE A FRACTION OF TIME, BUT AT A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS COST. IF THAT BUOY WOULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT ON THAT LINE, THE POT WOULD HAVE SHOT BACK, AND I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE, AND I SAW THE WHOLE THING. IF THAT BUOY WOULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT ON THAT -- THE BUOY'S SHOOTING OUT -- THE BUOY'S NOT GONNA STOP. NOW IT'S GONNA PULL THE WHOLE POT AT ME. I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THROWING LINES, GETTING RID OF THE LINES FIRST. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. IT'S ALWAYS DONE THE SAME THING. OH, REALLY? OKAY. WELL, THAT'S FINE. IF YOU CAN'T CONVERT, THAT'S FINE. JUST KEEP ON DOING IT THAT WAY. BUT WHEN A POT COMES UP -- YOUR BROTHER'S [BLEEP] LOOPY, MAN! I'M GETTING A LITTLE OFFENDED. THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS FIND A RHYTHM. WE'RE ON A TIME LIMIT, TOO, IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER. FIND A RHYTHM, JOHNNY. FIND A RHYTHM. TIME LIMIT, TOO, MY FRIEND. WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN THE SYSTEM HERE, BUDDY. YOU JUST CAME ON THE BOAT, MY FRIEND. OKAY. YOU JUST CAME ON THE BOAT. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING, ALL RIGHT? GOING FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER OUT OF ANGER ISN'T GONNA [BLEEP] FIX ANYTHING! IT'S NOT ABOUT SPEED. IT'S NOT ABOUT SPEED. OH, YEAH? WELL, THEN DON'T MAKE IT ABOUT SPEED. IT'S ABOUT BRINGING THE LAUNCHER DOWN, AND A POT -- THAT PART I GET. BRINGING THE POT INTO THE LAUNCHER WHEN THE LAUNCHER'S STILL UP TO MAKE A POINT -- THAT I DON'T SEE. I DON'T GO FOR ANY OF THAT EITHER. I AGREE WITH THAT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. TRUCE. AH, THERE WE GO. THERE'S A HANDSHAKE. THERE WE GO. RIGHT ON. YOU BET. Man: WE GOT A FOUR-MAN CREW. THIS BOAT'S NEVER HAD A FOUR-MAN CREW. WE HAD FISHING OUT OF TOTES. THIS BOAT NEVER FISHED OUT OF TOTES. WE'RE FISHING WITH POTS THAT THIS BOAT NEVER HAD BEFORE. THINGS GOT TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT. I DON'T LOOK AT IT LIKE THE "DECK BOSS." WE'RE ALL SO EXPERIENCED ON HERE. BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD SAY, ULTIMATELY, ON DECK, I WOULD HAVE THE FINAL SAY, YEAH. I'M SORRY YOU'RE -- APPARENTLY, YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN. HEY, I'M SORRY YOU'RE OFFENDED, DAVIN. I'M REALLY SORRY. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, THAT YOU'RE OFFENDED, ALL RIGHT? THROWING SHOTS, CLOSING DOORS, THROWING BAGS, AND DOING THE LAUNCHER -- HOW MUCH FASTER CAN YOU GO? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? THEY GOT TO WORK IT OUT. THEY'RE MATURE ADULTS, SO, HOPEFULLY, THEY CAN COME TO A COMPROMISE. Narrator: 40 MILES TO THE SOUTH, THE WIZARD HAS SPENT THE LAST 24 HOURS SETTING STRINGS ON NEW GROUNDS. AFTER PULLING 19 EMPTY POTS AT THE SLIME BANK, KEITH IS LOOKING FOR BETTER NUMBERS AND SOME MORE EXCITEMENT. Keith: YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T GET A REAL RUSH OUT OF HAULING SCRATCH FISHING. MAN, I'M AN ADRENALINE JUNKIE. Narrator: AFTER 24 HOURS OF BACKBREAKING WORK, THEY HAVE 150 POTS SOAKING -- ANOTHER BIG GAMBLE, AND CAPTAIN KEITH IS HOPING TO CASH IN. WE'RE ABOUT TO SPOT-CHECK OUR FIRST POT. I NEED EACH ONE OF THESE POTS TO CATCH 50 CRAB. I'M DONE. Man: WHOO-HOO! WE GOT A GOOD ONE, BUDDY! OH, YEAH. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] OH, YEAH! PHONE! CRAB! 70? 73. OH-HO-HO-HO-HO! WHOO! Man: YEAH, BABY! OOH, LENNY. Keith: I DON'T KNOW. I THINK PROBABLY ALL FISHERMEN ARE TROPHY HUNTERS. ISN'T THAT WHY WE DO IT? Narrator: IF THEY CAN KEEP THIS PACE UP, THE WIZARD WILL BE READY FOR THEIR FINAL OFF-LOAD IN A MATTER OF DAYS. Leveen: KEITH MADE HIS DECISION, AND HERE WE ARE IN THE LAND OF PLENTY. [ ROPE CRACKS ] COME ON. WHAT'S GOING ON? THAT [BLEEP] THING BROKE AGAIN. THE WELL BROKE RIGHT HERE. THERE'S A LITTLE PIECE OF IT RIGHT THERE. IT JUST BROKE. WHEN THE BOAT CAME NORTH THIS YEAR, WE TOOK A WAVE, AND A COUPLE POTS BROKE LOOSE AND CAME FLYING DOWN THE DECK, SNAPPED OFF THE ARM ON THE COILER. WE TOOK IT IN AND HAD IT WELDED. NOW I COME TO FIND OUT THAT'S POTENTIALLY GONNA BITE US IN THE BUTT. WE ASKED THEM TO REINFORCE THIS WITH SOME OTHER STOCK, AND THEY DIDN'T DO IT. Narrator: UNTIL THEY CAN GET BACK TO TOWN, THERE'S NO WAY TO FIX THE BROKEN COILER. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'VE GOT 25 POTS HERE. WELL, LET'S GET THEM ON HERE. HAUL THEM BY HAND. AFTER WHAT YOU GUYS  WENT THROUGH, GOT TO GET THEM ON HERE.  GOOD LUCK. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I KNEW THERE'D BE DAYS LIKE THIS. Narrator: WITHOUT THE COILER WORKING, HAULING POTS WILL SLOW. WE COULD VERY WELL BE HAND-COILING FOR THE REST OF THIS TRIP. MAN, DO IT LIKE THE OLD DAYS. THAT'S FINE. Man: JUST FINE. I MEAN, THERE'S DEFINITELY AN ART TO HAND-COILING AND DOING IT AND NOT KILLING YOURSELF. I MEAN, THE GUY THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING COULD JUST WIPE HIMSELF OUT. ARMS, BACK, EVERYTHING COULD GO LIKE THAT. LIKE RIDING A BICYCLE! IT'S ABOUT NOT PULLING ON THE LINE. YOU GOT TO LET IT KIND OF COME TO YOU. THE GOOD NEWS IS, IS THAT WE'RE CATCHING A BUNCH OF CRAB. THERE'S PROBABLY 50 IN THAT ONE, TOO. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS CATCH CRAB. WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THEM IN THE TANK AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Narrator: COMING UP... WATCH OUT ON THE RAIL, MAN. THERE'S A BIG ONE COMING HERE. Man: WHOA! Narrator: 160 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR. AFTER A BRUTALLY SLOW START PULLING POTS OF JUNK CRAB, CAPTAIN SIG AND THE NORTHWESTERN ARE ON THE GRIND. THEY HAVE 85,000 MORE POUNDS TO CATCH, AND MOTHER NATURE IS NOT MAKING IT EASY. IT'S JUST REAL SLOPPY. IT'S NOT THE GREATEST OF FISHING, BUT IT'S DOABLE. YOU JUST GOT TO REALLY WATCH IT, YOU KNOW? IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT A LITTLE EXCITEMENT AROUND HERE. Sig: HANG ON.  HANG ON. WATCH OUT. Bradley: RIGHT NOW ALL THE WEATHER'S ON THE PORT SIDE, SO THESE POTS ARE GETTING STUCK UNDERNEATH THE BOAT. YOU KNOW,  THEM POTS ARE SO DAMN HEAVY, THEY'RE JUST WHIPPING THEM  RIGHT IN THE WATER. I CAN GO UP AGAINST IT. YOU'RE STILL GONNA ROLL LIKE A [BLEEP] THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY SITTING RIGHT HERE. IT'S LIKE HAVING YOUR HAND IN A PILE OF GOLD. 64. Narrator: THE MEN HAVE GONE FROM POTS WITH 3 OR 4 CRAB TO COUNTS OF 50-PLUS, WITH 20 MORE TO PULL IN INCREASINGLY VOLATILE WAVES. THE WIND PERKS UP, AND SO DOES EVERYBODY ON BOARD. WATCH OUT ON THE RAIL, MAN. THERE'S A BIG ONE COMING HERE. Edgar: THAT'S THE WAY WE LIKE IT. WHOA! HO HO HO HO! YAHOO! [ GROANS ] WATCH THE RAIL THERE. LOOK AT THEM BIG, WHITE, FOAMY [BLEEP] Narrator: WITH 15-FOOT WAVES AND CROWDED FISHING GROUNDS, THE YOUNGEST DECKHAND IS STRUGGLING AT THE RAIL. JAKE HASN'T HAD A WHOLE LOT OF EXPERIENCE THROWING THE HOOK IN BAD WEATHER...YET. HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT. HE'S STILL GOT A FEW THINGS TO LEARN. OW! HANG ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Narrator: MATT BRADLEY REDEEMS HIMSELF WITH A HAIL MARY PLAY ONLY A HANDFUL OF MEN COULD HOPE TO PULL OFF. LAYER! LAYER FOR SURE?  OKAY. THERE WAS NO WAY HE WAS GONNA PULL IT TO HIM. THIS THING'S, LIKE, GOING 3 1/2 KNOTS FORWARD. HE AIN'T PULLING IT IN. I GOT LUCKY. THAT'S WHAT IT REALLY AMOUNTS TO. MATT SAVED THE DAY. HE'S A HERO. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST BEING A GOOD BACKUP. THAT'S ALL. IT WAS AN AMAZING SHOT. IT WAS A DOUBLE-GOOD SHOT. NOW THAT'S CRAB FISHING, DUDE! Sig: THAT JUST KIND OF GOES TO SHOW THAT HE'S CONCENTRATING SO MUCH ON THROWING THE HOOK AT A BAG, HE DIDN'T EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT BAGS THEY WERE. AND IT KIND OF LEADS INTO THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE THING, YOU KNOW? OKAY, THAT'S  A NORTHWESTERN POT. REEL IT IN.  COME ON, CHUCKY. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS, YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHERE A LITTLE MORE TIME ON DECK GOES A LONG WAY. IT WAS A GREAT THROW. TOO BAD IT WAS THE WRONG BAG. 38. RAD DAY. THAT WAS A RAD DAY. THAT'S KILLER. THREW A LOT OF CRAB ON THIS BOAT IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. Narrator: ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH"... DANGER ON THE DECK... WHOA! OUCH! ...AND DANGER ABOVE IT. WATCH AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T FALL OVER. Narrator: AND BELOW, HOPE FOR A MIRACLE... COME HOME, BABY! IF WE DON'T GET THIS, WE'RE SCREWED. Narrator: ...WHILE TWO TITANS BATTLE FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS. YES! THE ROUT IS ON. IT'S DOWN TO THE WIRE... [ CHEERING ] YEAH! ...FOR THE DEADLIEST CATCH. WHOO!
