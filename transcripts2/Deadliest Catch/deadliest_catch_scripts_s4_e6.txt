 RED GOLD RIGHT THERE! CRAB FISHING THERE, BABY. BUT FISHING HAS BEEN A BUST FOR CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN ON THE NORTHWESTERN... [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] Narrator: ...AND PHIL HARRIS ON THE CORNELIA MARIE. I MEAN, URGENCY IS GONNA START BEING A KEY FACTOR HERE. Narrator: WEEKS AWAY FROM FINAL OFF-LOADS, THE FATE OF EVERY DECKHAND'S PAYCHECK RIDES ON ONE MAN'S SHOULDERS... THE CAPTAIN. [ MID-TEMPO ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ] 220 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTHWESTERN IS BACK ON THE HUNT.

 AFTER OFF-LOADING 180,000 POUNDS FOR 756,000 BUCKS, CAPTAIN SIG FACES A NEW DEADLINE. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS CRAB IN BY THE 11th. THAT'S -- THEY CLAIM TO DROP THE PRICE IF WE DON'T GET IT IN THERE BY THEN. SO, OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO FILL THIS BOAT AND GET IT IN BEFORE THAT PRICE DROPS. [ GRINDING ] AS FAR AS THE FISHING, HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A GOOD PICK OUT OF THIS GEAR. I'M NOT EXPECTING MIRACLES. HOW'D IT LOOK? 43. 43. GOOD. Narrator: POT AFTER POT OF GOOD, CLEAN CRAB CONTINUE TO HIT THE TABLES. LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. 60 OR SOMETHING. IT'S BEEN OUR BEST STRING OUT WEST HERE. MAKES YOU HAPPY TO SEE IT. AT THE SAME TIME, IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. Narrator: WITH JUST 9 DAYS TO CATCH HIS REMAINING 190,000 POUNDS OF QUOTA, EVERY DECISION SIG MAKES MUST COUNT. EVERY TIME YOU SET A POT BACK -- "AM I DOING THE RIGHT THING?" OR EVERY TIME YOU STACK, GET MOVING SOMEWHERE -- "IS THIS THE RIGHT MOVE?" YOU'RE ALWAYS SECOND-GUESSING YOURSELF, AT LEAST I DO. Narrator: WITH SUCH SCARCE CRAB ON THE GROUNDS, SIG'S RELUCTANT TO SET BACK, EVEN AS HE AVERAGES 60 KEEPERS A POT. Sig: WE'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE TRIPS TO DO HERE, AND WE NEED TO STAY ON DECENT FISHING. SO, I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO THE OTHER WAY AND JUST -- NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT. PICK THEM UP. IF WE GET A DECENT PICK, JUST "THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD PICK," AND GO. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE A LOT OF TIME SCRATCHING AROUND ON AN AREA'S THAT'S BEEN HIT. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING BIGGER AND BETTER. Narrator: BUT FOR EDGAR, LEAVING BETTER-THAN-AVERAGE NUMBERS IS A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW. I'M READY TO SET BACK. [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, THAT KIND OF SCARES ME, LEAVING ALL THIS FOR SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW, BUT WHATEVER. HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T. HE BETTER. IT'S LIKE A GAMBLE, YOU KNOW? FISHING IS A GAMBLE. YOU GOT TO JUST GO WITH YOUR GUT, GO WITH WHAT YOU SEE AND DO IT AND TRY NOT TO LOOK BACK. WALKING AWAY. Narrator: WITH PRESSURE MOUNTING OVER A POTENTIAL WRONG MOVE, SIG HEADS DECKSIDE TO EASE ANY CREW CONCERNS. I KNOW THIS PLACE WILL COME BACK TO LIFE. IT'S JUST WHEN. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? RIGHT. AFTER EVERYBODY LEAVES. AFTER EVERYBODY LEAVES? YEAH. BUT, I MEAN, THE FACT IS IT'S NOT FAST FISHING -- PERIOD. I THINK WE DID THE RIGHT THING. YOU KNOW, FOR NOW, WE DID THE RIGHT THING. READY? Man: GAME ON. GAME ON! IT'S ALL LIES. EVERY DAMN BIT OF IT. Sig: I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THE VOLUME WE'RE SEEING IN THE POTS OR THE SORT WE'RE SEEING IS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY STICKING AROUND RIGHT NOW. MAYBE IT IS. I MEAN, I COULD BE WRONG. BUT I REALLY DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] I'M NOT BUYING IT TILL I SEE CRAB IN THOSE POTS. THEN I'LL BELIEVE IT. Narrator: NIGHT FALLS ON THE BERING SEA, 120 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST ON THE TIME BANDIT. Man on radio: TONIGHT,  NORTHWEST WINDS 40 KNOTS. SEAS 21 FEET.  RAIN. THIS WON'T BE VERY PRETTY. WHOO! Narrator: 25-FOOT SEAS AND A SHORTHANDED CREW ISN'T ENOUGH TO STOP CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN FROM FISHING. BUT IT WON'T MAKE THINGS ANY EASIER. WE GOT A LONG TWO WEEKS OR WHATEVER. WE GOT A BROKEN ANKLE. WE'VE HAD ALMOST AN ELECTRICAL FIRE. WE'VE HAD ALL KINDS OF BAD [BLEEP] KNOCK ON WOOD. Narrator: BUT JOHNATHAN'S PLAN IS TO HAUL GEAR UNTIL CONDITIONS GET TOO DANGEROUS TO FISH. SURE KNOCK ON A LOT OF WOOD AROUND HERE. Narrator: THE WIND AND SWELLS ARE RISING. HO HO-O-O HO! OH, YEAH! WOW, HE'S A BIG ONE. 92. 92 KING CRAB IN ONE POT. CRAB COMING! YEAH! Narrator: THE CRAB MAY BE SCARCE FOR SOME SKIPPERS, BUT JOHNATHAN'S BEEN ON A HOT STREAK FOR NEARLY FOUR WEEKS, AND HE'S SHOWING NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. IT'S TIME TO PLAY. 95. 95. 95. Narrator: AS INCREASING WESTERLY WINDS BLOW AGAINST THE TIDE, LARGE CONFUSED SEAS BEGIN TO BATTER THE DECK AND THE CREW. THEN, SUDDENLY... WATCH OUT! WHOA! HEADS-UP! CAREFUL, SHEA. FROM THE PULLEY. Narrator: A 4-INCH STEEL PIN SUPPORTING THE PICKING-HOOK PULLEY SNAPS. WITHOUT WARNING, 40 FEET OF HEAVY-GAUGE STEEL WIRE CAREENS TOWARDS THE DECK, MISSING GREENHORN SHEA LONG BY A MERE 3 FEET. THAT'S DANGEROUS [BLEEP] THERE. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] DID THE SPOOL FLY OUT OF THE PULLEY? IT'S ON DECK?  DID YOU SEE WHERE IT LANDED? IT'S STILL UP THERE? PICKING BOOM BLEW UP. WE WEREN'T HOOKED TO THE POT. IF IT WOULD'VE BEEN HOOKED UP TO THE POT, IT WOULD'VE PULLED THE CABLE RIGHT OVER SHEA'S BODY AND PROBABLY CUT HIM IN HALF. Narrator: IF THE PICKING HOOK HAD BEEN ATTACHED TO AN 800-POUND CRAB POT, THE TENSION WOULD HAVE YANKED THE CABLE TAUT AGAINST THE RAIL, KILLING GREENHORN SHEA INSTANTLY. LITERALLY, LIKE, I'M HERE NOW, BUT SHOULD IT HAVE BROKEN FIVE SECONDS LATER, HALF OF ME WOULD PROBABLY BE IN THE OCEAN AND HALF OF ME WOULD BE ON DECK. Johnathan: HOW YOU GONNA STOP WHEN YOU BUY A BLOCK FROM A FACTORY SOME [BLEEP] SLACKER IN INDIANA OR WHEREVER THEY BUILT THAT SON OF A [BLEEP] OUGHT TO BE KICKED RIGHT IN THE [BLEEP] HE ALMOST KILLED SOMEBODY, OKAY? Narrator: COMING UP... A GREENHORN THREATENS THE EARLY DAWN SEASON. TRYING TO MAKE A DOLLAR HERE, DUDE. LAZY. LAZY KIDS. Narrator: AND THE TIME BANDIT TEMPTS FATE ONCE AGAIN. ONE FALSE MOVE, YOU'RE DEAD. Narrator: 245 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE TIME BANDIT HAS STOPPED FISHING. CAPTAIN JOHNATHAN SLOWLY JOGS IN 25-FOOT SEAS AND 40-KNOT WINDS AS THE CREW EXAMINES CARNAGE FROM AN EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION... ...THAT ALMOST KILLED GREENHORN SHEA LONG. THAT'S DANGEROUS [BLEEP] THERE. Narrator: ENGINEER NEAL HILLSTRAND LOWERS THE BOOM SO ANDY CAN ASSESS THE DAMAGE. WHOA! GOOD! WELL, WE GOT LUCKY TO FIND A USED PULLEY, 6 TON, INSTEAD OF A 5-TON PULLEY THAT SHATTERED ON US. GOOD? YEAH. Narrator: THE PULLEY IS SET IN PLACE, BUT THE ONLY WAY TO ATTACH THE SAFETY CHAIN IS TO CLIMB THE 50-FOOT MAST. Neal: WHO WANTS TO CLIMB UP THERE? BLOWING 40 -- ONE FALSE MOVE, YOU'RE DEAD. STAND BY. Narrator: NEAL SLOWLY SCALES THE MAST WHILE JOHNATHAN KEEPS A WATCHFUL EYE FOR ANY INCOMING WAVES THAT COULD KNOCK HIS BROTHER OFF THE MAST. IT AIN'T REALLY AN EASY THING TO DO TO -- CLIMBING UP THAT LADDER IN 40-KNOT WIND. GET IT? WE'RE BACK IN ACTION. Neal: KIND OF WEAR YOU OUT. IT'S SCARY UP THERE, CLIMBING UP THERE TO HOOK THAT HOOK. PULLING LIKE 45 UP THERE. WIND'S TRYING TO BLOW YOU OFF THE TOP. YOU'RE HANGING ON FOR YOUR LIFE. PUMP YOU OUT. Narrator: NOW, WITH THE NEW BLOCK ATTACHED, THE HILLSTRANDS GET BACK TO BUSINESS. Johnathan: IF YOU SEE HOW MANY TIMES I KNOCKED ON WOOD THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, I'D HAVE KNOCKED ON EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THIS [BLEEP] [BLEEP] AREA HERE ON WOOD. I'M DONE KNOCKING ON WOOD. NOBODY KNOCKS ON WOOD,  OR I'LL KICK THEIR ASS. HOW ABOUT THAT? Narrator: 45 MILES TO THE WEST, THE 108-FOOT EARLY DAWN IS FISHING IN THE CALM AFTER THE STORM. OH! WITH SUCH FEW CRAB IN THE HOLD, CAPTAIN RICK FEHST HAS SPENT THE LAST TWO WEEKS MOVING HIS GEAR. AND TODAY, THE COLD STREAK CONTINUES. SPOT CHECK. SPOT CHECK. SPOT CHECK. IT'S LIKE A NO-MAN'S-LAND. GARBAGE DUMP. AW, MAN. 5. YOU KNOW, WE'VE PULLED 300 POTS. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A VISUAL ON THE TANKS. THAT'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF GEAR FOR NO VISION OF THE CRAB TANKS. WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY ON THE SORT TABLE. WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP! Narrator: THE ONLY LIFE IN THE POTS ARE TINY STARFISH. WHEN YOU GET ALL THESE STARFISH IN THE POTS, IT MEANS HE SET THE GEAR ON A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD SPOT. AND THE CRAB TEND TO AVOID THAT TYPE OF BOTTOM. IT'S 60-HOUR SOAK, SO... MY THEORY NOW IS THESE CRAB ARE OFF THE BITE. Narrator: BAD FISHING BREEDS LOW MORALE, AND WITH THE CREW STILL FIRED UP OVER BRYAN NODDING OFF AT THE WHEEL, THE GREENHORN BECOMES AN EASY SCAPEGOAT. ALMOST MADE IT IN TIME. WHEN ARE TWO GUYS WORKING? NEVER. ONE POT. WE'VE GOT TIME IN BETWEEN. I KEEP TRYING, CHIEF. UNDERSTAND IT'S GOT TO BE DONE. I HAVEN'T BEEN STANDING AROUND. I'VE BEEN TRYING. I WANT IT DONE. I KNOW HOW TO DO IT. LAZY. LAZY KIDS. TRYING TO MAKE A DOLLAR HERE, DUDE. I SEEN YOU IN THE LAST STRING. YOU WERE DRAGGING ASS. DRAGGING ASS. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: SINCE EXTRA TIME SPENT OUT AT SEA ISN'T REFLECTED IN THE CREW'S PAYCHECKS, RICK NEEDS TO LAND ON CRAB SOON. OTHERWISE, HE MAY FIND HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF MUTINY. COMING UP... AN OLD LEGACY EMERGES. 3 YEARS SINCE WE DID RED CRAB SEASON, AND IT FEELS REALLY GOOD TO BE BACK. FIRST POT! WHOO! WHOO-HOO! THE TIMING HAS TO BE PERFECT IN ORDER TO GET DONE. Narrator: BACK IN DUTCH, AFTER A THREE-YEAR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE BERING SEA, THE 110-FOOT NORTH AMERICAN REJOINS THE HUNT FOR RED KING CRAB. [ GRUNTS ] A LITTLE MORE, TRAVIS. ONE, TWO... OVERHEAD. OVERHEAD. IS THAT YOUR GO-TO-SEA SUIT? [ LAUGHS ] GOT TO BRIGHTEN IT UP -- MAKE IT FESTIVE HERE, YOU KNOW? IT'S THE FIRST TIME BACK IN THREE YEARS. WHAT ARE YOU, NORWEGIAN? 110% NORWEGIAN. STEN SKAAR, SECOND-GENERATION NORWEGIAN FISHERMAN, WILL TAKE THE HELM. THINGS FIRED UP HERE. WE'LL HEAR THE ROAR OF THE 399 KITTY CAT, AND WE'LL BE READY TO GO. Narrator: BUT THE ROAD TO A COMEBACK WASN'T EASY. IT TOOK SOME NEGOTIATING FOR STEN TO TALK HIS DAD AND BOAT OWNER ERLING INTO LETTING THE NORTH AMERICAN COME OUT OF RETIREMENT. ...FUEL, INSURANCE. THIS IS WHAT WE DO. WE'VE DONE THIS FOR 20 YEARS. I JUST WANT A SHOT. AND I DESERVE A SHOT. IT HAS TO BE JUSTIFIED, STEN, THE NUMBERS. YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'D BE A FUN THING TO DO. SO, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE NUMBERS, THEN. YOU WANT NUMBERS? I'LL GET YOU NUMBERS. FINALLY, WEEKS INTO THE CRAB SEASON, STEN CONVINCED HIS OLD MAN TO GIVE HIM A SHOT. [ AIR HORN BLOWS ] TRAPPED JUST BEYOND THE STERN. LET THE STERN GO. GOOD LUCK, FELLAS. THANKS. BE SAFE. THANKS, CORY. WELL, WE'RE LEAVING DUTCH FINALLY. IT'S BEEN ALMOST THREE YEARS HERE. READY FOR KING CRAB. YOU GOT A BUOY THERE? MY BIGGEST FEAR RIGHT NOW IS I'VE BEEN OUT OF THE GAME FOR A WHILE AND TRYING TO FIND THE CRAB, YOU KNOW? HOPE I HAVEN'T LOST MY TOUCH. JUST GOT TO GO OUT AND GET 'ER DONE. [ IMITATES MONKEY CHATTER ] [ LAUGHS ] OH, TRAVIS. Narrator: ALTHOUGH CAPTAIN STEN IS SIX WEEKS BEHIND THE REST OF THE FLEET, HE'S DETERMINED TO REVIVE THE 20-YEAR SKAAR FAMILY TRADITION. NORTH AMERICAN'S BACK IN ACTION. FEELS REALLY GOOD TO BE BACK. HEADING OUT HERE, IT'S THE FEELING. FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF ELECTRIC, YOU KNOW? HOPEFULLY THE CRAB GODS WILL BE GOOD TO US WHEN WE SET THEM. Narrator: 185 MILES NORTH OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE EARLY DAWN STEAMS TOWARDS POTS ON AN 18-HOUR SOAK. CAPTAIN RICK FEHST MOVED ALL 300 POTS AFTER PULLING NOTHING BUT BLANKS, BAIT, AND STARFISH. I GOT A FEELING WHERE I'M TAKING THIS GEAR IS GONNA BE JUST FINE. JUST A HUNCH. Narrator: AND ON DECK, GREENHORN BRYAN CONTINUES TO SLACK OFF. BUT SINCE ENGINEER MIKE FISH HAS SPENT THE LAST YEAR MENTORING BRYAN, HE DECIDES IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER LESSON IN HUMILITY. AND I'LL DO YOUR JOB. WANT TO TRY? 20 POTS. 20 POTS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT 20 POTS, FISH WILL TAKE OVER BAIT DUTIES WHILE BRYAN RUNS THE RAIL. COMPETITION ALWAYS GETS THE BLOOD FLOWING -- ALWAYS. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: BRYAN'S FIRST SHOT MISSES. COME ON! OH! I DON'T NEED TO DO THE CIRCLE OF SHAME THIS TIME. I'LL BACK UP. Narrator: AFTER THREE STRAIGHT MISSES, CAPTAIN RICK THROWS THE BOAT IN REVERSE -- A HOOK MAN'S BIGGEST INSULT. Fish: LIKE, THE OTHER DAY, HE WAS TELLING ME, "OH, YOU DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT? THAT'S AN EASY JOB YOU'RE DOING." NOW HE'S OVER HERE GETTING FRUSTRATED. HE SAID HE COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH THE BAIT. WELL, I'M MAKING PLENTY OF BAIT, KEEPING UP. LIKE THERE -- SECOND HOOK. MISSED AGAIN. HE TELLS EVERYBODY ELSE THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLES. WHOO! Narrator: FINALLY, ON BRYAN'S SIXTH THROW, HE LANDS THE HOOK. BUOY! WHOO! THEY'VE GOT RIDERS ON THE POT -- THE FIRST SIGN IN WEEKS THAT THEIR CAPTAIN MAY BE ON THE BITE. Fish: JUST PICKED UP 30 POUNDS OF CRAB -- $120 ON THE BACK OF THE POT. I THINK WE'RE GETTING ON TO SOMETHING HERE. SOMETHING GOOD. WHOO! [ GRUNTS ] Fehst: CRABS ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE, SO THEY'RE HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW. WELL, IT'S GOOD. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. Narrator: GOOD CRAB KICKS EVEN THE GREENHORN INTO FULL STRIDE. WHEN YOU MAKE HIM GO DO THE JOB, THEN HE CAN DO IT. BUT HE ALWAYS HAS THE ATTITUDE "I CAN'T DO IT," OR HE DOESN'T WANT TO. BUT WHEN YOU MAKE HIM DO IT, HE CAN DO IT. HE CAN DO THE JOB. Narrator: AFTER 20 POTS, BRYAN HEADS BACK TO THE BAIT BIN. Mezich: WE CAN HAUL A STRING AND EVERYBODY WILL BE TOTALLY PISSED OFF AND STRESSED OUT. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL BLANK AND WE'RE GETTING NO NUMBERS. THREE HOURS LATER, WE COULD HAVE FULL STRING WITH 50s AND 60s -- EVERYBODY'S CHEERING, SCREAMING, HAVING A GOOD TIME. THE GUY YOU WERE JUST PISSED AT, ABOUT TO HIT, YOU'RE BUDDYING UP WITH. Fish: CRAB ARE MOVING RIGHT ON OUR GEAR RIGHT NOW, SO WE'RE GONNA PICK THESE, REBAIT THEM HEAVY. WE'LL SOAK THEM FOR TWO DAYS. WE SHOULD SEE 60s AND 70s. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. WE'LL LOAD THIS BOAT UP IN THREE DAYS. HEAD TO TOWN. RIDING. WHOO-HOO! Narrator: COMING UP... HOIST AWAY! ...MISCHIEF ON THE WIZARD. A LITTLE PRESENT FOR MY FRIEND STEN. Narrator: AND CAPTAIN SIG MUST PUT DOWN A DECKHAND UPRISING. YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION AND GO WITH IT. HIS DECISION. GOD, I LOVE MY JOB. LOVE MY JOB! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GET THE HELL OFF. Narrator: BACK IN THE COMFORTS OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE 155-FOOT WIZARD IS OFF-LOADING FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON. A TANK FULL OF RED KING CRAB. Narrator: CAPTAIN KEITH COLBURN FOUND THE CRAB EARLY AND NEVER LOST THE SCENT. MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DID SOMETHING WHEN YOU SEE THAT HATCH GET POPPED AND IT'S FULL OF CRAB, RIGHT? YEAH. DEFINITELY MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE THE BUMPS AND BRUISES WERE WELL WORTH IT. YEAH. FOR GREENHORN MOI, FIVE WEEKS OF BATTLING THE BERING SEA TOOK ITS TOLL. DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB TO COME DO THIS [BLEEP] Narrator: BUT NOW, THE GREENHORN FINALLY SEES THE PAYOFF. I DON'T SEE ANY CRAB IN THERE. I SEE DOLLARS. HAVEN'T DONE THE FINAL TALLY YET, BUT IT'S LOOKING LIKE WE'RE AT OR NEAR 200,000 POUNDS, AND THE GUYS ARE STOKED. SO AM I. AFTER 48 HOURS, THE FINAL BRAILER IS LIFTED. GRAND TOTAL FOR THE WIZARD'S FIRST TRIP -- 183,000 POUNDS. THAT'S ALMOST $800,000. EIGHT SHOTS OF JAGER. Narrator: BEFORE SHOVING OFF, CAPTAIN KEITH TAKES HIS BOYS TO THE BAR FOR A CELEBRATORY SHOT. WE GOT A BUCK 68 LEFT IS ALL. THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT. YOU KNOW, WE HAD MORE, BUT THEN THE NORTH AMERICAN DECIDED AT THE LAST SECOND TO GO FISHING, SO WE GOT THAT CRAB. FOR THE PAST TWO SEASONS, KEITH LEASED THE NORTH AMERICAN'S QUOTA. NOW, SINCE CAPTAIN STEN'S RECLAIMED HIS STAKE, KEITH WANTS REVENGE. I'M NOT A PRANKSTER KIND OF GUY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE NEED SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE. WE NEED SOMETHING ORIGINAL. WHICH ONE ARE WE TAKING? THE BLUE ONE? BLUE, GUYS, BLUE. LYNN. COME HELP US WITH THIS, LYNN. HOIST AWAY! UP. OH, IT'S RIPE, TOO. [ LAUGHS ] HOP IN, GUYS. LET'S GO. IT'S A LITTLE PRESENT FOR MY FRIEND STEN. STEN'S FULL OF [BLEEP] WE JUST NEED TO REMIND HIM. PLUS, IT'S A "WELCOME BACK TO THE BERING SEA" PRESENT. LYNN! [ LAUGHS ] HELL, ARE YOU GONNA RIDE? GO AHEAD. GET IN THERE. I WAS USING THE BATHROOM. Narrator: 200 MILES NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, AFTER LEAVING PROVEN GROUNDS, NORTHWESTERN CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN APPROACHES THE FIRST POT OF THE STRING HE SET IN NEW TERRITORY. BEST-CASE SCENARIO FOR US RIGHT NOW IS IF THAT FIRST LOAD OF GEAR HITS REAL WELL. Narrator: SIG TOOK A HUGE GAMBLE. HE LEFT THE HIGHEST NUMBERS HE'S SEEN ALL SEASON ON A HUNCH. HE'S GOING FOR THE BIG HIT. I MEAN, WE GOT A LOT OF QUOTA LEFT. WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CRAB TO CATCH. Sig: WE'RE UNDER THE GUN AS FAR AS GETTING UNLOADED BY OUR DATES. WE'VE BEEN UNDER THE GUN AS FAR AS TRYING TO GET UNLOADED NOW BEFORE PRICE DROP. SO, IT'S IMPORTANT TO US TO TRY TO STAY ON CONSISTENT FISHING. GUYS... SO, THE FIRST POTS OF OUR FIRST SET ARE COMING UP HERE. WE'LL SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. 18. UGH. WE WANT MORE THAN THAT. WHAT WAS THAT ONE -- ANOTHER TEEN? 18, 17. NOT SO GOOD. Narrator: AT THIS RATE, IF SIG STAYED ON PROVEN GROUNDS, HE COULD HAVE PULLED THREE TIMES AS MUCH CRAB. AND THE SALTY DECKHANDS AREN'T PLEASED. GOT TO POINT THE FINGER AT SOMEBODY. WELL, I MEAN, YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION AND GO WITH IT. RIGHT OR WRONG, YOU HAVE TO SET YOUR POT SOMEWHERE. YEAH, YOU GOT TO HAVE A FALL GUY. HIS DECISION. YOU HAVE TO PICK AN AREA AND WORK IT AND TAKE YOUR CHANCES. NEED TO FIND A SPOT HERE. WE DO HAVE AN UNLOAD DATE. WE DO HAVE JUST A FEW DAYS TO FILL THIS BOAT NOW. I WANT TO FILL THIS BOAT. I NEED TO FILL THIS BOAT AGAIN. Narrator: NOW THE CREW IS BACK ON A LOW-NUMBER GRIND, A HEAVIER WORKLOAD, AND MORE TIME AT SEA. Sig: MONEY IS NOT THE ISSUE FOR US RIGHT NOW. IT'S TIME. TIME IS WHAT MAKES US MONEY. YOU KNOW, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME MOVING GEAR, SO NOW I GOT TO MAKE UP THAT TIME BY HAULING SOME POTS. I MEAN, AS LONG AS THERE'S CRAB AROUND AND WE CAN GRIND AWAY, WE WILL GRIND. GOD, I LOVE MY JOB. I LOVE MY JOB! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GET THE HELL OFF. Narrator: COMING UP... THE EARLY DAWN KID'S SHOT AT REDEMPTION. AND THE WIZARD'S SECOND TRIP COULD BE HER GREENHORN'S LAST. VERY, VERY, VERY TIRED RIGHT NOW. WE'LL SEE HOW THIS SECOND TRIP TREATS HIM. Narrator: 185 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE 110-FOOT NORTH AMERICAN HAS REACHED THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE KING CRAB FISHING GROUNDS. TO CAPTAIN STEN, IT'S A WELCOME SIGHT. BUT HIS STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. RED CRAB, TO ME, IS LIKE SUPER BOWL OF FOOTBALL. UNTIL YOU HAUL THAT POT, IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS, YOU KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET. WHAT'S UP, ERIK? YO HO HO! Narrator: ALTHOUGH STEN IS SIX WEEKS LATE, HE HAS HIRED HIRED FRIEND AND FELLOW SKIPPER ERIK NYHAMMER AND WILL RELY HEAVILY ON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE GROUNDS. ARE YOU GONNA RUN IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION? I COULD SET STRAIGHT NORTH ON THESE. I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY FAVOR IN THIS GULLY. Skaar: ERIK'S DEFINITELY AN ASSET. YEAH, HE'S BEEN FISHING A LONG TIME. HE KNOWS THIS OCEAN VERY WELL. TO HAVE TWO CAPTAINS ON BOARD, YOU LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER AND YOU CAN TOSS DIFFERENT IDEAS. READY TO GET THESE IN THE WATER. YOU GUYS CAN RELAX. I'M HERE. GO AHEAD AND GET THE DECK READY, JOHN. WE'RE GONNA SET WITH IT, SO IT'LL BE A NICE SET. FIRST POT OF THE SEASON HERE WE'RE GONNA SET. OUR FIRST STRING IS GONNA BE 23 -- 2-3. Skaar: THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR NOW. A LOT OF PREPARATION WENT INTO THIS MOMENT HERE. IT'S AMAZING ALL THE TIME AND HOURS COMES DOWN TO THE FIRST POT. FIRST POT! YEP! WHOO! WHOO-HOO! OVER! Narrator: DROPPING FIRST POTS IS A TRIUMPHANT MOMENT, BUT THIS GEAR COMES WITH A TICKING CLOCK. SINCE THE POTS BELONG TO ERIK, FISH AND GAME WILL ONLY ALLOW THE SKIPPER A TWO-WEEK WINDOW TO FISH THE BORROWED GEAR. THE TIMING HAS TO BE PERFECT IN ORDER TO GET DONE. EVERYTHING HAS TO GO JUST LIKE A CLOCK. Narrator: STEN SKAAR'S RETURN COUNTS ON THIS TRIP RUNNING FLAWLESSLY, BUT PERFECTION IS HARD TO CATCH ON THE BERING SEA. Skaar: ONE POT AT A TIME. ONE DAY AT A TIME, YOU KNOW? JUST CHIP AWAY. Narrator: 20 MILES TO THE WEST, THE WIZARD STEAMS NORTH TOWARDS SOAKING POTS AND A MOUNTING STORM FRONT. Keith: THE WEATHER IS UP. IT'S NASTY, BUT IT'S MANAGEABLE. SO WE'RE WORKING IN IT. Narrator: AS THE BOAT APPROACHES THE GEAR, KEITH TAKES A QUICK DETOUR TO TARGET CAPTAIN STEN SKAAR ON THE NORTH AMERICAN. Keith: HEY, YOU GUYS, WE'RE NOT  GONNA HAVE TO GO TOO FAR TO FIND THE NORTH AMERICAN. I TRACKED HIM. HE'S RIGHT OFF THE END OF OUR STRING HERE. NOW WE CAN GET RID OF OUR PACKAGE. OUR PRESENT. WE'RE DONE WITH OUR HOLES FOR FLOW. GET THE FLOW GOING THROUGH THERE SO IT DON'T FALL APART. IF IT COMES UP IN ONE PIECE, IT SHOULD BE PRETTY FUNNY. Keith: SHUT THE DOOR, BOYS! TIME TO LAUNCH HER. [ LAUGHS ] HEADS-UP. ONCE IT FILLS UP WITH WATER, SHE'LL SINK LIKE A ROCK. BON VOYAGE. YEAH! WHOO! GOOD! COME ON, GUYS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALREADY KIND OF DONE OUR GOOFING AROUND. NOW IT'S TIME TO START HAULING GEAR. Narrator: 30 MINUTES AFTER DROPPING THE PRANK POTTY, SEAS SURGE TO 30 FEET AND WIND PICKS UP TO 50 MILES AN HOUR. WE GOT A 90-POUND STRING WE'RE PULLING AND IT'S PRETTY [BLEEP] OUT, AND I GOT TO THROW HERE. WHOA, GARY. GOT TO HANG BACK HERE TILL IT'S UP THERE! OH, YEAH! IT'S GETTING STARTED OUT HERE NOW! THAT'S RIGHT. LET IT GO FORWARD A LITTLE. GOOD. THIS IS JUST LOVELY. Narrator: AS WATER POURS OVER THE RAIL AND RAIN PELTS THE MEN, GREENHORN MOI CAN'T KEEP THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF HIS FISHING EQUIPMENT DRY -- HIS HANDS. MY GLOVES ARE ON THE OUTSIDE 'CAUSE MY RAINCOAT KEEPS SLIDING UP OVER THEM. I TRIED RUBBER BANDS. I TRIED ALL KINDS OF [BLEEP] HEY, MOI, COULD YOU COME UP TO THE WINDOW FOR ME HERE REAL QUICK? HEY. SHOW ME YOUR HANDS. I WANT TO SEE YOUR [BLEEP] NO. WHAT IS THIS? IT KEEPS SLIDING UP. LISTEN, YOU GOT TO -- I'M DOING MY BEST, MOI, TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR HANDS, ALL RIGHT? BUT YOU'VE GOT TO USE SOME COMMON SENSE, TOO. I'LL BET YOUR HANDS ARE SOAKING WET RIGHT NOW, AREN'T THEY? THEY'RE NOT BAD RIGHT NOW. WELL, THEY'RE GONNA GET BAD. YOU'RE GONNA HAUL 90 POTS IN A ROW, AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE ORANGE OVER THE BLUE. USE SOME RUBBERS -- WHATEVER IT TAKES. YOU GOT TO WORK WITH ME HERE, ALL RIGHT? OTHERWISE, YOU'RE HANDS ARE GONNA BE GARBAGE, AND THEY'RE GONNA BE COMPLETELY WORTHLESS. I'M TRYING TO KEEP THEM DOWN, AND I TRIED THE RUBBERS. THEY KEEP SLIDING UP. THEN GO TO A DIFFERENT JACKET. OKAY. ALL RIGHT? HELP ME OUT ON THIS ONE, ALL RIGHT? GOSH DARN IT, MAN. WELL, YOUR HANDS GET WET AND SWEATY REGARDLESS, BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR COAT INSIDE YOUR GLOVES LIKE IT'S TRYING TO DO TO YOU. Keith: LOOK AT THE KID. KID'S GOT THAT YELLOW JACKET ON. IT'S GOT THE NEOPRENE SLEEVES ON. NICE AND SNUG DOWN. HANDS ARE TOASTY-WARM AND DRY. HIS HANDS ARE FINE. WE GOT MR. MOI HERE, DECIDES HE'S GONNA SET SOME TREND AND PUT HIS GLOVES OUTSIDE OF HIS ORANGE JACKET. I MEAN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST HAVE A FUNNEL WITH WATER DRAINING DOWN IN THERE. WORKING MAN'S HANDS. BEAT UP. BANGED UP. LAST THING I NEED IS TO GO SHORTHANDED BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S HANDS FALL COMPLETELY APART. THESE ARE MY WORKING HANDS. YOU LOOK AT MOI'S HANDS, AND YOU LOOK AT THE KID'S HANDS. THE KID'S HANDS DON'T EVEN LOOK LIKE THEY'RE EVEN BEAT UP AT ALL. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T GET IT. Narrator: AFTER GETTING HIS GEAR STRAIGHT, MOI HEADS BACK OUT FOR THE FINAL 45 POTS. I'M FEELING VERY, VERY, VERY, TIRED RIGHT NOW. I WOULD LOVE TO CATCH A LITTLE NAP. Keith: IT'S A LITTLE EARLY NOW TO BE LOOKING HAGGARD. SHOULD BE PRETTY FRESH RIGHT NOW. WE'LL SEE HOW THIS SECOND TRIP TREATS HIM. Narrator: COMING UP... THE FATE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN IS AT STAKE. THE CRAB COUNT. DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS, THE EARLY DAWN AND THE NORTH AMERICAN ARE TRAILING. Narrator: IN THE EARLY MORNING, 185 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST OF DUTCH HARBOR, THE NORTH AMERICAN APPROACHES HER FIRST STRING OF PROSPECT POTS AFTER A 12-HOUR SOAK. AFTER SPENDING THREE YEARS ON THE SIDELINES, CAPTAIN STEN SKAAR HAS A LOT TO PROVE. THIS IS OUR FIRST POT OF KING CRAB HERE. POT NUMBER E-3. YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF STRESSES HERE. IT DOES WEIGH ON YOU. Man: FIRST POT OF THE SEASON. IT'S GONNA SET THE TONE. FIRST POT. HERE IT COMES. ALL RIGHT. COMING UP! WAITING FOR THE COUNT HERE. 3. HERE YOU GO. I DON'T THINK THERE'S LIFE HERE. PRETTY AVERAGE RIGHT NOW. BUT I DIDN'T COME UP HERE TO DO AVERAGE. IT'S KIND OF A SMALL AVERAGE, SO... THINK THIS IS A DESERT AREA. Narrator: DAWN BREAKS OVER CALM SEAS. FOR THE PAST 4 HOURS, CAPTAIN STEN HAS HAULED 12 TEST POTS FROM THREE SEPARATE STRINGS, BUT ONLY CAUGHT A FEW HUNDRED KEEPERS. NOW, WITH THE LAST PROSPECT STRING OFF HER BOW AND THE FATE OF THE NEXT 13 DAYS RESTING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN, THE CREW RALLIES IN HOPE OF BETTER NUMBERS. GOOD SHOT. WE'RE HOPING FOR THE BEST. KIND OF NERVE-RACKING, THAT'S FOR SURE. HERE IT COMES. WHOA. WHERE'S -- WHOA! [ LAUGHS ] YEAH. WHERE'S THE POT? I KNEW IT. AW! [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH. WHOA! OH, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST HOPE THERE'S CRAB IN IT, THAT'S ALL. THERE BETTER BE CRAB IN THERE. THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY. [ LAUGHTER ] "ERIC'S DINER." "ERIC'S DINER." [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THE COMEBACK KID ISN'T CATCHING CRAB, BUT RATHER A BERING SEA WELCOME-HOME CARD, COURTESY OF THEIR FRIENDS ON THE WIZARD. Skaar: WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. [ LAUGHS ] WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. IT'S JUST GOOD TO BE BACK, MAN, AFTER TWO YEARS -- SEEING THE GUYS EXCITED. THERE'S NOT A FEELING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS? Narrator: EMPTY TANKS AND A TICKING CLOCK, IT'S BACK TO BUSINESS. THE FIRST POT COMES OVER THE RAIL STUFFED WITH CRAB. ALL RIGHT. WHOA, LOOK AT THAT! WOW! [ LAUGHS ] BUT AFTER THE SORT... KIND OF SORTED A LOT OF FEMALES. Narrator: THE BUZZ OF THE FIRST POT IS SHORT-LIVED. THE CRAB ARE MOSTLY FEMALES AND JUVENILES AND MUST BE TOSSED TO PRESERVE THE HARVEST. THERE WAS ONLY 22 IN THE FIRST POT. SO, WE'RE GONNA STACK THEM ON BOARD BECAUSE THINGS MIGHT IMPROVE AS WE KEEP HAULING. SO, IF IT CLEANS UP, WE HAVE OUR BULLETS BACK ON THE STERN READY TO BE LAUNCHED. LOT OF SORTING HERE. IT'S GONNA GO SLOWER WITH MORE CRAB. 600, 700 CRAB, AND 10 OF THEM ARE GOING DOWN IN THE TANK. WE'RE NOT TOO INTO THOSE RATIOS. Narrator: AFTER THREE STRINGS OF JUNK CRAB, THE NORTH AMERICAN HAS SPENT MORE TIME SORTING THAN HAULING POTS. AND TIME IS THE ONE THING THEY CAN'T WASTE. Skaar: IT WOULD BE REAL DRAG AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE -- WORKED SO HARD TO HAVE THINGS GO SOUR ON US AND MY DAD DECIDES NOT TO FISH THE BOAT JUST BECAUSE THE NUMBERS AREN'T THERE. Narrator: ACROSS THE FLEET, EVERY CAPTAIN SETS HIS SIGHTS ON THE FINISH LINE. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT, THE PRESSURE TO FINISH STRONG SITS SQUARELY ON THE MAN IN THE WHEELHOUSE. ON THE NEXT "DEADLIEST CATCH"... IT'S A RACE TO THE FINISH LINE AS CREWS FACE BATTLE EPIC STORMS. ABOUT TIME WE GOT A LITTLE EXCITEMENT AROUND HERE. WHOA! CAPTAINS STOP AT NOTHING TO CASH IN ONE LAST TIME. 73? [ LAUGHS ] WHOA! WE'RE NEVER GOING HOME. THERE'S A BIG ONE COMING HERE. WHOA! HO HO HO! EVERYBODY WONDERS WHY I SMOKE LIKE A [BLEEP] CHOO-CHOO TRAIN. Narrator: AND FOR ONE CAPTAIN, THIS RACE MAY BE HIS LAST. THE HUNT CONTINUES FOR THE DEADLIEST CATCH.
