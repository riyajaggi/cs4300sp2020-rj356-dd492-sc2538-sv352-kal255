 IT'S 45 BELOW OUT THERE. DID YOU REACH NELSON? JUST ENOUGH TO LET HIM KNOW WE'RE ONTO THE PROBLEM OF RESTACKING THE ATOMS. THEN THE MAGNETIC STORM GOT TOO ROUGH. WANT SOME COFFEE? HAVE YOU FINISHED THE REPORTS? ALMOST. [Sighs] THE COLD'S EVEN GETTING THROUGH THE WALLS. SHALL I TURN ON THE EXTRA HEATERS? GO AHEAD. I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME YOU COME FROM HARDY PIONEER STOCK WHEN I MARRIED YOU. WELL, I WAS JUST PUTTIN' YOU ON, SO I COULD SPEND MY HONEYMOON STUCK ON AN ICE FLOE NEAR THE SOUTH POLE... JUST PULLING SAMPLES OF PLANKTON OUT OF THE OCEAN. WHAT EVERY GIRL WANTS. ICE STATION "T" FOR TICKTOCK TO SEAVIEW. COME IN, SEAVIEW.

 ICE STATION "T" FOR TICKTOCK TO SEAVIEW. CAN YOU READ ME? COME IN, SEAVIEW. OH, I THINK I'LL GO GET SOME SLEEP. WILL YOU WAKE ME WHEN IT'S SUMMER? MM-HMM. ICE STATION "T" FOR TICKTOCK TO SEAVIEW. ICE STATION "T" FOR TICKTOCK TO SEAVIEW. CAN YOU READ ME, SEAVIEW? FIRST REPORT, PENNELL, ICE STATION "T" TO NELSON. PRELIMINARY SEPARATIONS OF THE BACTERIAL AND ENZYME PROPERTIES... OF, UM, BETA, DELTA AND KAPPA PLANKTON SAMPLES... REVEAL UNSTABLE STACKING OF ATOMS OF LATTICE. PLANKTON RISES TO SURFACE OF WATER IN DARKNESS, SINKS AGAIN AT SUNRISE. THIS IS A PROCESS LONG OBSERVED WITHOUT ADEQUATE EVIDENCE... TO EXPLAIN THE, UH, PHENOMENON. IT HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO LIGHT AND, UH, TO HEAT... WITHOUT ANY CORRELATING EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A DEFINITE CONCLUSION. NOW, PHOTOSYNTHESIS OBVIOUSLY PLAYS A ROLE IN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MICROORGANISM. YET, THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE, UH, A PREDILECTION OF THE, UM, VITAL PLANKTON ORGANISMS... TO SPEND A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THEIR TIME IN THE DEEPER LAYERS OF THE SEA, WHERE THERE IS INADEQUATE LIFE IN PARTICULAR. AND NATURALLY, THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROCESS... DEPENDS UPON THE CHLOROPHYLL IN THE PLANT CELL. DIATOMS IN THE PLANKTON DIVIDE. WHEN THIS OCCURS, EACH OF THE OLD VALVES... [Continues, Indistinct] [Screaming] [Yelling] HELP! HELP! BOB, HELP ME! [Screams] THE PLANKTON! ANNA! THE PLANKTON! ANNA! ANNA! [Man] VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. STARRING RICHARD BASEHART, DAVID HEDISON. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. ICE STATION "T" FOR TICKTOCK. SEAVIEW CALLING ICE STATION "T" FOR TICKTOCK. COME IN, STATION "T." OVER. [Static] ANYTHING? NOTHING BUT MAGNETIC INTERFERENCE, SIR. TRY ANOTHER WAVELENGTH. YES, SIR, BUT I'M AFRAID IT WON'T WORK. THE STORM'S ALL OVER THE DIAL. ICE STATION "T." THIS IS SEAVIEW CALLING ICE STATION "T." COME IN, ICE STATION "T." OVER. [Static Continues] SEAVIEW CALLING ICE STATION "T." SEAVIEW CALLING ICE STATION "T." [German Accent] THIS IS THE RESULT FROM THE R-22 SERIES. I'LL HAVE THE ANALYSIS CORRELATED. DON'T BOTHER. IT'S WORTHLESS. WE'RE ON THE WRONG TRACK. I'VE SAID THAT ALL ALONG, DR. REISNER. THE PENNELLS ARE MUCH CLOSER TO THE ANSWER. MISS LYLE, I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE, AND I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR IT AGAIN. THIS IS NOT A REPORT FOR YOUR AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION DEPARTMENT. I WILL BE THE ONE TO DECIDE WHAT IS THE CORRECT APPROACH! DOCTOR, THIS IS A JOINT VENTURE... BETWEEN PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND THE NELSON INSTITUTE, EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THEM. NOW, WE CAN'T MAKE ANY FINAL JUDGMENT UNTIL AFTER WE TALK WITH THE PENNELLS. - AND WHEN WILL THAT BE? - WE'RE STILL TRYING TO REESTABLISH RADIO CONTACT. IN ANY CASE, WE SHOULD BE THERE WITHIN 24 HOURS. RADIOMAN, GIVE ME A REPORT ON ICE STATION "T"! [Sparks On Speaker] MAGNETIC STORM'S GETTING WORSE. WE'RE PICKING UP NOTHING BUT STATIC, SIR. KEEP AT IT, SPARKS. FROM NOW ON, ANY INFORMATION YOU WANT FROM THE RADIO SHACK, YOU GET FROM CAPTAIN CRANE OR MYSELF. IF I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY MANNERS, IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US, DOCTOR. I HAVE GIVEN 15 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO THIS PROJECT. I HAVE SPENT ONLY FIVE. BUT WE'RE ALL AFTER THE SAME THING. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? HAVE YOU EVER SEEN PEOPLE STARVING? HAVE YOU EVER STARVED? IF WE CAN BREAK THROUGH, PLANKTON CAN BE A SOURCE OF FOOD THAT WILL SAVE THE LIVES OF UNBORN MILLIONS. EXCUSE ME, ADMIRAL. WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE. MEANING ME. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF BEING TREATED LIKE A COMMON SEAMAN. DO I HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT I REPRESENT THE COMPANY... WHOSE INVESTMENT MADE THIS RESEARCH POSSIBLE? NOW, WE HAVE A HEALTHY CURIOSITY ABOUT HOW YOU'RE SPENDING OUR MONEY ON THIS PLANKTON THING. I CAN ASSURE YOU, MY REPORT WILL NOT SET WELL WITH THEM. I, UH, REALIZE, SIR, IT IS NOT EASY TO SHARE A CABIN WITH A SCIENTIST. WITH A NAZI. HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT. COME TO THE WARDROOM AND I'LL BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE. SO, IT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN OR FORGIVEN... THAT I LIVED AND WORKED IN HITLER'S GERMANY. I'LL BE IN MY CABIN IF YOU WANT ME. [Sighs] IF YOU DISLIKE HIM SO MUCH, WHY DID YOU PICK HIM FOR THE PROJECT? HE WAS THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB. I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE EVERYONE I WORK WITH. IT'S MY JOB TO RUN THIS SUB. I CAN'T DO IT WITH PEOPLE... LEE, I'M-I'M SORRY, BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS PLANKTON PROBLEM. IT'S JUST BECOMING A LITTLE BIT TENSE. MMM. WELL, I HOPE YOU FIND A SOLUTION BEFORE SOMETHING BLOWS. SO DO I, LEE. YOU'VE LOST CONTACT OF THE SEAVIEW, GENERAL? IT IS THE MAGNETIC STORM. IT HAS MADE OUR TRACKING INSTRUMENTS ERRATIC. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FORESEEN. IT WAS. THERE'S ALREADY AN AGENT ABOARD THE SUBMARINE... WHO, AT THE PROPER TIME, SHALL ACTIVATE A HOMING SIGNAL, AND THEN WE SHALL HAVE A TRUE FIX ON THE SUBMARINE. VERY GOOD, GENERAL. I AM PLEASED THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PLANKTON SECRETS. RULE THE BELLIES OF THE PEOPLE, AND YOU RULE THE PEOPLE. RULE THE PEOPLE, AND YOU RULE THE WORLD. PLANKTON COULD BE THE KEY. [Explosion] DAMAGE CONTROL, FIRE DETAIL TO FRAME 85 ON THE DOUBLE! [Reisner Coughing] GET A MEDIC FOR THIS MAN! MR. MORTON, TAKE 'ER UP. SCRUB THE SHIP OF SMOKE. AYE, AYE, SIR. - WHAT HAPPENED HERE? - I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS A SIMPLE COMPOUND. IN THE FUTURE, DOCTOR, THERE'LL BE NO MORE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS... WHILE WE'RE RUNNING SUBMERGED. ALL RIGHT. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. IS THE FIRE SECURED? ALL RIGHT. CLEAR THE CORRIDOR. HELP ME THERE. WE'VE SCRUBBED THE SMOKE, SIR. VERY WELL. TAKE HER DOWN, CHIP. AYE, AYE. PREPARE TO DIVE. STAND BY TO BLOW TANKS. BALLAST TANKS FULL. CLOSE THE VENT. FLOOD NEGATIVE. FULL DIVE ON THE PLANES. FULL DIVE. SECURE THE AIR! ALL GREEN. DIVE! UP SCOPE. DOWN SCOPE. FINAL TRIM 90 FEET, SIR. GOOD, CHIP. CARRY ON. [On Speaker] CAPTAIN, MISSILE ROOM. KOWALSKI. YES, WHAT IS IT? SIR, CAN YOU COME AFT? WE'VE GOT VISITORS. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. SEEMS TO BE SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHO MAKES THE RULES ON THIS SHIP. I DON'T REALLY SEE WHAT HARM THERE IS. AND SINCE WE'RE HERE ANYWAY, COULDN'T WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT-AT THAT? OR IS THAT ONE OF YOUR JEALOUSLY GUARDED SECRETS? THE MINISUB ISN'T CLASSIFIED. BUT YOU'D BETTER WAIT FOR THE CAPTAIN. THIS AREA'S OUT OF BOUNDS. NOT TO US. CAN ONE PERSON OPERATE IT? IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT IT'S REALLY A TWO-MAN JOB. HOW DO YOU LAUNCH IT? THROUGH AN AIR LOCK DOWN THERE. OH. THEN IT'S MORE THAN A TWO-MAN OPERATION? NOT REALLY. IN AN EMERGENCY, THIS CONTROL ACTIVATES THE AIR LOCK MECHANISM. A TWO-MAN CREW CAN SIT RIGHT THERE AND LAUNCH THEMSELVES. KOWALSKI, HAVE YOU TOLD THEM THIS SECTION'S RESTRICTED? YES, SIR. YOU WERE TOLD THERE WERE CERTAIN AREAS ON THIS SHIP YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO ENTER. - WHAT DOES THIS SAY? - NOW LOOK HERE, CAPTAIN. SINCE I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FINANCING THIS OPERATION... I KNOW YOUR COMPANY'S FOOTING THE BILLS FOR THIS EXPEDITION, BUT THE RESTRICTED AREAS OF THIS SHIP REMAIN OFF-LIMITS... TO EVERYONE BUT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL. NOW, IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN, YOU'LL BE CONFINED TO YOUR QUARTERS. [On Speaker] CAPTAIN CRANE, THIS IS SPARKS. YES, SPARKS? SIR, COULD YOU COME FORWARD TO THE RADIO SHACK? RIGHT AWAY. KOWALSKI? - YES, SIR? - ESCORT THE PASSENGERS FORWARD. AYE, AYE, SIR. I TRIED TO CHECK IT OUT, SKIPPER. IT COMES AND GOES. I'LL ADVISE THE ADMIRAL. ANY WORD FROM PENNELL ON ICE STATION "T"? NO, SIR. THAT MAGNETIC STORM'S STILL FOULING UP RECEPTION. MM-HMM. [Knocking] COME IN. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE, SIR. WELL, GO AHEAD, LEE. ALONE. WILL YOU EXCUSE US, DOCTOR? COMMUNICATION'S PICKING UP A STRANGE SIGNAL, SIR. FROM WHERE? RIGHT ON TOP OF US. WE MAY HAVE A SUB RIDING US PIGGYBACK. COULD BE A POWER LEAK. NO, NO, I DOUBT IT. IT SEEMS TO BE A SLAVE CIRCUIT TIED INTO OUR POWER SOURCE. WE'RE TRYING TO PINPOINT IT RIGHT NOW. ANY IDENTIFIABLE SIGNAL? NO, NONE. JUST A STANDARD, CONTINUOUS BEEP LIKE A HOMING SIGNAL. SOMEBODY SEEMS AWFULLY ANXIOUS TO FIND OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHERE WE'RE GOING. WE ARE GETTING A CLEAR HOMING SIGNAL NOW. OUR TRACKING INSTRUMENTS ARE LOCKED ON SEAVIEW, SIR. GOOD. OUR MISSION, GENERAL, HAS TWO OBJECTIVES. PLAN ONE: OBTAIN THE SECRET FOR SYNTHESIZING PLANKTON. PLAN TWO: SINK THE SEAVIEW WITH ALL HANDS... SO THEY CANNOT RETURN WITH WHAT THEY KNOW. AND IF THE FIRST PLAN FAILS? YOU'LL MAKE SURE THE SECOND WILL NOT. BUT I HAVE A VALUABLE AGENT ABOARD! I MUST MAKE PROVISIONS FOR ESCAPE FROM THE SUBMARINE. IT HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR. ONCE THE SEAVIEW REACHES THE ICE STATION, OUR AGENT WILL BE RESCUED. AND THEN, THE SEAVIEW WILL BE SUNK. WE'RE STILL HAVING NO LUCK LOCATING THAT HOMING SIGNAL. IS SPARKS STILL PICKING IT UP? YES, SIR. YOU KNOW, I THINK SOMEBODY SMUGGLED SOME KIND OF A DEVICE ABOARD. - WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, LEE? - ADMIRAL, YOU'VE GOT THREE GUESTS ABOARD. ONE OF THEM ALMOST BLEW US OUT OF THE WATER. THE OTHER TWO WERE SNOOPING AROUND THE RESTRICTED AREA. NOW, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THEY'RE ALL SUSPECT. FROM NOW ON, ALL VISITORS WILL BE LIMITED TO AUTHORIZED AREAS. HEY, WHAT THE... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME! TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF... GET RIGHT IN THERE! - NOW, THIS NAZI WAS OUTSIDE, LISTENING! - WELL, DOCTOR? I WAS COMING TO CONSULT WITH YOU. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST KNOCK AND COME IN? I DIDN'T WANT TO INTERRUPT YOUR CONVERSATION. HE'S LYING. LEE, WILL YOU TAKE MR. WESLEY FORWARD? AND I WANT THAT SEARCH DOUBLED. DOCTOR, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. - I WAS NOT TRYING TO HEAR. - WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO? I WAS COMING TO TALK WITH YOU. ABOUT WHAT? PHILLIP WESLEY. GO AHEAD. HE IS JEOPARDIZING THE PROJECT WITH HIS CONSTANT INTERFERENCE AND SUSPICIONS. HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO OR WHY. HE IS CHOKING ME WITH... DR. REISNER! MR. WESLEY IS ABOARD HERE BECAUSE MONEY IS NECESSARY FOR THIS PROJECT. THAT IS A FACT OF LIFE. IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF PHILLIP WESLEY. YOU'VE MANAGED TO ALIENATE EVERY PERSON ABOARD THIS SUB. NOW, WHY? YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR 20 YEARS, ADMIRAL NELSON, BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ME. I KNOW THAT YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LEAVE HITLER'S GERMANY, AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT. HAVE YOU NEVER MADE A MISTAKE, ADMIRAL? THAT IS WHY I CAME TO AMERICA AFTER THE SURRENDER. I WAS SICK OF WAR AND KILLING. I WANTED TO SAVE LIVES, NOT TAKE THEM. WELL, YOU-YOU CAN'T DO IT BY YOURSELF. YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO TRUST THE PEOPLE YOU'RE WORKING WITH, AND, ABOVE ALL, YOU MUST HAVE PATIENCE, DOCTOR. PATIENCE? I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR PATIENCE! SIX MONTHS IS ALL I HAVE. THERE WAS A REACTOR FAILURE IN MY LABORATORY. I RECEIVED A MASSIVE DOSE OF RADIATION. IN SIX MONTHS, I WILL BE DEAD. KEEP THE SEAVIEW BUTTONED UP, LEE. WE'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AYE, SIR. OH, NO. WHAT HAPPENED HERE? WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS? NELSON TO SEAVIEW. COME IN, SEAVIEW. [Sparks] READ YOU, ADMIRAL. OVER. TELL CAPTAIN CRANE THE ICE STATION'S DEMOLISHED. WE'RE INVESTIGATING NOW TRYING TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE. STAND BY. OVER AND OUT. WHAT IS THIS SLIME? IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE. I'D HAVE TO RUN SOME SAMPLES, BUT I-I THINK IT'S PLANKTON. THE POOR PENNELLS. NO SIGN OF 'EM. THEY COULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED THIS. GET AS MUCH OF THIS AS YOU CAN. DID THEY TRANSMIT ANY HINT, ANY CLUES? NO. SATELLITE OBSERVATION CONFIRMS THAT ICE STATION "T" HAS BEEN REACHED, SIR. GOOD. CARRY OUT THE NEXT PHASE OF OPERATIONS. [Man On Radio] U.S. AIR FORCE CRAFT "J" FOR JENNY, "K" FOR KILO, "S" FOR SUGAR, 149 TO SEAVIEW. COME IN, SEAVIEW. COME IN, PLEASE. OVER. THIS IS SEAVIEW. WHO ARE YOU? PLEASE IDENTIFY. YOU'RE BEING TRACKED. OVER. JKS-149 BASED OUT OF BAFFIN AIR RECONNAISSANCE GROUP... INSTRUCTED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH YOU. MAY I LAND? YOUR COORDINATES, PLEASE. OVER. SEAVIEW TO JKS-149. WHAT'S YOUR MISSION? PLEASE STATE FULLY. OVER. LISTEN, CHARLIE, I'M JUST A BUSH PILOT SENT OUT TO PICK UP SOME EGGHEAD ON YOUR SUB. NOBODY TELLS ME NOTHIN'. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IT IS, BUT I GOT A SEALED, WATERTIGHT PACKET RIGHT NEXT TO MY LITTLE PIXIE HEART THAT TELLS ALL. NOW, IF YOU'LL LET ME DOWN OUT OF THE FOGGY, FOGGY DEW, YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT YOURSELF. A VERY COLD OVER. OKAY, SMILIN' JACK, BRING IT IN ON THE BEAM WE SEND YOU. AND WEAR YOUR MITTENS. IT'S COLD DOWN HERE. WHY WOULD WASHINGTON WANNA PICK UP ONE OF OUR PEOPLE? I DON'T KNOW, CHIP. THAT WASN'T MENTIONED IN OUR ORDERS. SKIPPER, A SINGLE PLANE'S JUST ENTERED OUR PERIMETER. SPARKS, GET ME THE ADMIRAL. SEAVIEW TO ICE STATION "T." SEAVIEW TO ICE STATION "T." COME IN. ICE STATION "T," NELSON. GO AHEAD, SEAVIEW. OVER. ADMIRAL, THIS IS LEE. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AN ORDER FOR AN AIR FORCE PLANE... TO LAND AND PICK UP ONE OF OUR PASSENGERS? OVER. THAT'S NEWS TO ME. HAS SPARKS GOT ANYTHING ON HIS LOG? OVER. NEGATIVE. WHY WOULD THEY MAKE SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WITHOUT INFORMING US? IT DOESN'T READ RIGHT TO ME. OVER. NOR TO ME. FIND SOME WAY TO CHECK IT OUT. OVER. AYE, SIR. OVER AND OUT. TIE ME IN WITH THAT PLANE. SEAVIEW TO JKS-149. COME IN, SMILIN' JACK. THIS IS THE LAST OF THE GREAT BIRDMEN. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YA, PAPPY? I MEANT TO ASK YOU BEFORE. WHAT PART OF THE STATES ARE YOU FROM? THE BRONX, DADDY. PELHAM PARKWAY, SOUTHERN BOULEVARD AND 172nd STREET. GREAT. THEN YOU MUST KNOW COLONEL WASHBURN FROM BAFFIN. HE'S FROM YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM LATELY? SURE! WE PLAY PINOCHLE EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT. YOU KNOW HIM, HUH? HOW ABOUT THAT? YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT? ORDER FIRE CONTROL ALERT. BLAST THAT PLANE OUT OF THE SKIES. TOM WASHBURN'S BEEN DEAD FOR SIX YEARS. FIRE CONTROL, LOCK ON TARGET IN OVERHEAD PERIMETER AND FIRE ONE. WE MISSED, CAPTAIN. THE MAGNETIC STORM'S FOULED UP OUR TRACKING MECHANISM. CORRECT FOR ERROR. AYE, SIR. TRACK IT MANUALLY. LOCK AND EXPLODE BY AUTO-CONTROL. THAT'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO SWITCH, SIR. THEN GET CRACKING! HE'S CLOSE! WE MAY NOT HAVE A FEW MINUTES! HE'S SWITCHED HIS APPROACH PATTERN, SKIPPER. ATTACK TRAJECTORY. GET ME THE ADMIRAL. SEAVIEW TO ADMIRAL NELSON. WHAT IS IT, LEE? HOSTILE PLANE MAKING A PASS. TAKE COVER! [Airplane Overhead] GET DOWN! WE GOTTA GET BACK TO THE SUBMARINE! [Lyle Screams] COME ON! COME ON! NO! NO! NO! [Screams] MISSILE CONTROL ON MANUAL, SIR. FIRE TWO. MISSILE LOCKED ON TARGET. - SCRATCH ONE BOGEY. - GOOD. SPARKS, KOWALSKI, GIVE ME A HAND HERE. TAKE HER DOWN. THERE MAY BE MORE PLANES UP THERE LIKE THAT. PREPARE TO DIVE. ALL RIGHT. TAKE HER TO MY CABIN. HUH, DOCTOR? 7:45. SO... NO JAW DISLOCATION. IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL ABOUT CONCUSSION. SORRY. I HAD TO HIT YOU. ONLY WAY I COULD THINK OF TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. WE'RE MOVING. YES. WE'RE SAFE NOW. COUPLE HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE ICE AND HEADING HOME. NO! TAKE IT EASY, MA'AM. LET ME GO! WE'VE GOT TO SURFACE! I'VE GOT TO STOP THEM! I CAN'T LET HER GET UP NOW. HOLD HER DOWN, WILL YOU? LET ME GO! I'VE GOT TO SEE THE CAPTAIN! THIS'LL KEEP HER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO. PLEASE, LIE BACK. ROLL UP HER SLEEVE. NO! CAPTAIN CRANE, HELP! CAPTAIN CRANE, HELP! HELP! RELAX! NO! [Static, Pennell Grunting] ANNA! [Screaming] WHATEVER HIT THEM MUST'VE COME SO FAST, THEY COULDN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES. IT MAKES NO SENSE. NO BODIES, NO PATTERN OF DESTRUCTION. THAT THIN FILM ALL OVER THE WALLS... IT'S PLANKTON. BUT IN A FORM THAT NEITHER DR. REISNER NOR I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. [Explosion] DAMAGE PARTY REPORTS ALL MAIN CONTROL GEAR SMASHED. WE'RE ON EMERGENCY GENERATORS. ANY COMPUTERS OPERATIONAL? NONE. WE'RE STONE-BLIND AND DEAD IN THE WATER. CHIP, CAN WE MAINTAIN TRIM? WE HAVE SO FAR. I HOPE WE CAN HOLD IT. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? OH, UH, EXCUSE ME. [Crane] ONE MINUTE, DR. REISNER. WE WERE BOOBY-TRAPPED. FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL, THERE WAS A MINIATURE LIMPET ATTACHED TO THE DEPTH GAUGE. ONCE WE GET BELOW 400 FEET, IT WAS RIGGED TO GO OFF. BUT WOULD ANYONE WANNA SINK THE SEAVIEW WITH HIMSELF ON BOARD? MUST'VE RIGGED IT WHILE WE WERE ON THE SURFACE. THAT EXPLAINS THE PHONY AIR FORCE PLANE. WHOEVER PLANTED THE BOMB PLANNED TO GET AWAY ON THE PLANE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS, SIR? IT MUST'VE BEEN RIGGED WITH THE BOOBY TRAP. - DR. REISNER? - YES? MAY I BORROW YOUR LIGHTER? OH, YES, OF COURSE. IS THIS IT? YES, IT... BUT... THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I... I-I-I'VE HAD THIS LIGHTER FOR YEARS. IT NEVER HAD A RADIO... THIS IS A VERY COMMON LIGHTER. I KNOW DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEM. ON THE SEAVIEW? - THAT IS NOT MY LIGHTER. - WHERE IS YOURS, DOCTOR? I-I DON'T KNOW. BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER? THAT IS NOT MY LIGHTER! PATTERSON! YES, SIR? TAKE THIS MAN TO HIS CABIN. KEEP HIM UNDER ARREST. AYE, SIR. [Sighs] CAN WE... CAN WE JURY-RIG SOME KIND OF CONTROL SYSTEM? TIME IS ALL WE NEED, SIR. WHAT WAS THAT EXPLOSION? WE'VE GOT OUR HANDS FULL RIGHT NOW. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER. WHAT WAS IT? I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. MR. WESLEY, GO TO YOUR CABIN. I DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON... WESLEY, GET OUT OF HERE! WE'RE HOLDING STEADY, SIR. ALL ENGINES STOPPED. IF WE CAN RIG A MANUAL PUMP TO EACH OF THE BALLAST TANKS, WE CAN BLOW THEM AND SURFACE. THEN WE RADIO BAFFIN TO FLY IN REPLACEMENT PARTS. WE LOST OUR GENERATORS. OUR GYROSTABILIZER'S OUT. WE'RE LOSING TRIM. SWITCH TO MANUAL! NOTHING HAPPENS, SIR. WE'RE DROPPING. GET TWO TECHNICIANS UP TO THE GYRO ROOM ON THE DOUBLE! KOWALSKI, FOXX, GET BACK TO THE GYRO ROOM! JUMP! HEY, FOXX, WHAT IS THAT STUFF? KOWALSKI! FOXX, GIVE ME YOUR HAND! HELP, KOWALSKI, HELP! [Screaming] [Screaming] [Panting] KOWALSKI! FOXX! WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT HAPPENED TO FOXX? IT... IT GRABBED HIM, AND THEN... IT GOT HIM! [Sobbing] GYRO ROOM. CHIEF, THE CO2 TANK. YES, SIR. IT GOT TO THE GYROS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE OUT OF CONTROL. THE PLANKTON'S REGENERATING ITSELF. THE PENNELLS NEVER HAD A CHANCE. HURRY WITH THOSE TANKS, WILL YOU? CLEAR THAT STUFF OUT. I'VE GOTTA GET TO THE MANUAL GYRO. WE CAN'T HOLD IT BACK MUCH LONGER! GET DR. REISNER. LEE! CHIEF! THAT'LL HOLD! COME ON! [Nelson] LEE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WE'RE CUT OFF! GET AFT, AND DOG ALL HATCHES BEHIND YOU. WE'LL TRY TO CONTAIN IT TO MIDSHIPS. DOCTOR, DID YOUR EXPERIMENTS GIVE ANY HINT OF THIS? WELL, THERE IS REGENERATION IN PLANKTON, BUT ONLY AT A VERY PRIMITIVE LEVEL. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL. YOU SUPPOSE THAT THE PENNELLS' RECORDS MIGHT BE THE KEY TO IT? - PERHAPS. - ALL RIGHT, COME ALONG. IT'S ALL RIGHT. SOMEONE SABOTAGED THE CONTROLS, AND WE'RE SINKING. - WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE. - I'M NOT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THERE'S NO WAY OUT. WESLEY. HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO LIVE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THE SABOTAGE. I PLANTED THE BOMB. NOW, THERE IS ONE WAY OUT OF HERE, BUT ONLY FOR TWO PEOPLE. THE MINI-SUB. YOU LISTEN TO ME, AND YOU AND I WILL BE THE TWO PEOPLE THAT USE IT. [Morton On Speaker] CAPTAIN CRANE? YES, CHIP. WE CAN'T HOLD THESE BULKHEADS UP HERE. IT'S BURST THROUGH TWO ALREADY. HOW FAR FORWARD IS IT? IT'S MOVING INTO THE FLOOD CONTROL CHAMBER AND THE CONTROL ROOM. THEY'RE ONLY SEPARATED BY A BULKHEAD. SECURE ALL WATERTIGHT HATCHES. SKIPPER! COME ON! COME ON, CAPTAIN! HURRY UP! IT'LL TAKE IT A WHILE TO BREAK THROUGH. ADMIRAL? YES, LEE? GO AHEAD. WE'RE TRAPPED AFT IN THE MISSILE ROOM. CAN YOU STOP IT FROM THAT END? WE'RE WORKING ON IT. HOLD ON, LEE. WE'RE DOING OUR BEST. SOMETHING WAS DONE TO THE PLANKTON. SOME RADIATION WAS USED, OR SOME CHEMICAL ADDED. BUT PENNELL LEFT NO INDICATION. YEAH, HIS RECORDS ARE INCOMPLETE. THE TAPE WAS DAMAGED, AND PROBABLY PART OF IT DESTROYED. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS? NO, I'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS. IT'S JUST SOME PERSONAL PAPERS. THERE'S NO RECORD HERE OF HIS EXPERIMENTS. IT'S JUST... YOU FOUND SOMETHING? HIS WEDDING LICENSE. WEDDING LICENSE. IT SAYS HERE THAT ROBERT V. PENNELL WAS MARRIED TO KAREN JOYCE COMSTOCK. SO? SO, KAREN. KAREN. HIS WIFE'S NAME WAS KAREN. BUT ON THE TAPE, HE KEPT CALLING FOR ANNA. "ANNA!" MM-HMM. WELL, DON'T YOU SEE? HE WASN'T CALLING FOR HIS WIFE. HE WAS TRYING TO SPEAK WHEN THE PLANKTON ATTACKED HIM. WHAT HE MUST'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY WAS ANAEROBIC. ANAEROBIC BACTERIA? BACTERIA THAT LIVES ON AIR. THEN IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS ADDED TO THE PLANKTON, BUT SOMETHING THAT WAS MISSING THAT MADE IT GROW. EXACTLY! THE ANAEROBIC BACTERIA KEEPS THE PLANKTON UNDER CONTROL, BUT HEAT DESTROYS ITS POWER TO CHECK GROWTH, AND THE PLANKTON RUNS WILD. HEAT. HEAT IS WHAT MAKES IT GROW. THEN THE ANSWER IS... [Nelson On Speaker] COLD. WE CAN FREEZE THE PLANKTON, DROP IT TO A TEMPERATURE WHERE IT'LL BECOME DORMANT AGAIN, THEN BLOW IT OUT LIKE BALLAST. BUT WE CAN'T CUT THE HEAT OFF. THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM'S DEAD. THEN SOMEONE'S GOTTA GET INTO FLOOD CONTROL AND OPEN THE EMERGENCY HATCH TO THE SEA. THE IN-RUSHING FREEZING WATER SHOULD DO IT. ANYBODY WHO TRIES TO GO IN THERE IS DEAD. IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE. AYE, AYE, SIR. [Crane On Speaker] ADMIRAL, I'VE GOT AN IDEA. DON'T LET... LEE? LEE? COME IN, LEE. LINE'S DEAD. COMMUNICATION SYSTEM'S OUT. WE HAVEN'T MUCH LONGER. YOU WON'T LAST OUT THERE AT THIS DEPTH, SKIPPER. I'VE GOT 10 MINUTES. I'VE GOTTA TAKE THAT CHANCE. - PATTERSON, ANY LUCK ON THAT INTERCOM? - STONE-DEAD, CAPTAIN. COME ON. COME ON. LET'S GO. THAT'S IT. ANOTHER BULKHEAD DOWN. UNLESS WE CAN STOP IT THERE, WE'RE FINISHED. IF WE FLOOD THAT COMPARTMENT AND THE ONES DIRECTLY BEHIND IT... WHOEVER GOES IN THERE TO OPEN UP THE SEA HATCH WON'T BE COMING BACK. BUT IT MUST BE DONE. WHAT WE KNOW NOW MUST BE PUT TO USE. I HAVE THE LEAST TO LOSE AND THE MOST TO GAIN. YOU STILL DON'T KNOW ME, DO YOU? NO. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. PATTERSON, ANY LUCK ON THAT INTERCOM YET? I'M TRYING TO TIE IN ON ANOTHER CIRCUIT, SKIPPER. WELL, KEEP ON IT! AND LET THE ADMIRAL KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IF YOU CAN GET THROUGH. OKAY, CHIEF. ALL RIGHT. [Knocks] MISSILE ROOM TO CONTROL ROOM. MISSILE ROOM TO CONTROL ROOM. MISSILE ROOM TO CONTROL ROOM. YES, PATTERSON, THIS IS NELSON. COME IN. THE CAPTAIN'S OUTSIDE THE SUB, SIR. HE SAID DON'T TRY TO ENTER THE FLOOD CONTROL CHAMBER. HE'S GOING TO OPEN THE HATCH FROM TOPSIDE. THANKS, PATTERSON. WELL, DOCTOR, YOU HEARD HIM. I HAD JUST ABOUT DECIDED THAT YOU WERE THE ONE... ADMIRAL, DOCTOR, STEP AWAY FROM THERE. DO NOT OPEN THAT HATCH. WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE, SO DO AS I SAY. YOU THREATEN A DYING MAN WITH DEATH? OH, YOU'LL DIE ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR. - THE MINI-SUB ONLY HOLDS TWO. - YOU'LL NEVER GET TO THE MINI-SUB THROUGH THERE. IT'S FILLED WITH PLANKTON. DON'T TRY TO STOP US, ADMIRAL. I CAN UNDERSTAND HER MOTIVES, WESLEY, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU? THAT'S SIMPLE, ADMIRAL. I WANNA LIVE. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, CAN'T YOU? I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT COMPLETELY. PHILLIP WESLEY IS NO WORSE THAN THE REST OF YOU. THAT IS WHY THE MEN I WORK FOR WILL WIN IN THE END. THAT IS NOT SO. I KNOW THE KIND OF MEN YOU'RE WORKING FOR. THEY ALL END THE SAME WAY. OPEN IT. [Nelson] YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH THERE. IT'S ALIVE WITH PLANKTON. THAT ROOM IS FULL OF PLANKTON! [Screaming] I HAD TO CLOSE THE HATCH. IF IT HAD GOTTEN IN HERE... I HAD TO DO IT. [Water Rushing Overhead] LISTEN. THE FLOOD CONTROL CHAMBER'S OPEN TO THE SEA. IT'S OVER. AS SOON AS WE FIND A HOLE IN THE ICE, WE CAN SURFACE. DR. REISNER? HMM? ONE OF THE CREWMEN FOUND THIS UNDER A TABLE IN THE WARDROOM. I THINK IT'S YOURS. I HOPE WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS WORTH WHAT IT COST. SOMEDAY IT WILL BE. WE WON'T SEE IT, BUT WE'VE OPENED THE DOOR.
