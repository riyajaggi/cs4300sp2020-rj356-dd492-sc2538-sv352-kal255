 MINOR DISASTERS, GENTLEMEN, COMPARED TO THE TRAGEDY WHICH IS ABOUT TO STRIKE. IN EXACTLY 11 DAYS, A GIGANTIC WALL OF WATER... WILL SMASH AND DESTROY THE COASTAL REGIONS OF HALF THE WORLD. THAT'S IT, GENTLEMEN. UNLESS WE ACT AT ONCE, WE FACE THE GREATEST SINGLE DISASTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH. GENTLEMEN, ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY THE WORLD'S FOREMOST SEISMOLOGISTS, DR. CLAUDE SELBY AND HIS ASSOCIATE DR. FRED WILSON. DR. SELBY. NO DOUBT OF IT, GENTLEMEN. IN EXACTLY 11 DAYS, TWO EARTHQUAKES WILL OCCUR IN THE ARCTIC. NOW, THE FIRST WILL BE MODERATE, BUT THE SECOND, FOLLOWING IN A MATTER OF HOURS, WILL GENERATE ENORMOUS TIDAL WAVES AS DR. WILSON WILL DESCRIBE. THESE TOWERING WAVES WILL ROAR DOWN THROUGH THE BERING STRAITS, INUNDATE HAWAII AND GO ON TO STRIKE THE WEST COAST OF AMERICA A SMASHING BLOW. AND IN THE OTHER HALF OF THE WORLD, THEY WILL SWEEP DOWN HERE, SMASH THE BRITISH ISLES, WESTERN EUROPE... AND GO ON TO DEMOLISH OUR OWN EAST COAST. WE'VE GOT 11 DAYS. I SAY EVACUATE ALL THE THREATENED AREAS. OH, IMPOSSIBLE. IF NEWS OF THIS IMPENDING DISASTER REACHES THE PUBLIC, IT COULD TOUCH OFF A WORLDWIDE PANIC. AND EVEN IF WE AVOIDED THAT, EVACUATION WOULD MEAN TRYING TO MOVE NEARLY A BILLION PEOPLE. THERE'LL BE MASS HYSTERIA, EPIDEMICS, WHOLESALE STARVATION. AT LEAST WE'D BE SAVING SOME LIVES. - THERE'S NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. - BUT THERE IS, GENERAL. WE CAN ADOPT ADMIRAL NELSON'S PLAN. A PLAN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE MUST RECOMMEND FOR THE PRESIDENT'S IMMEDIATE APPROVAL. WITH SUCH APPROVAL, I PROPOSE TO DETONATE A NUCLEAR DEVICE NEAR THE NORTH POLE... AT THE EXACT INSTANT OF THE SECOND QUAKE. IT'S TOO RISKY. THE EXPLOSION COULD DOUBLE THE FORCE OF THE TIDAL WAVES. JUST THE OPPOSITE, DOCTOR. THE EXPLOSION WILL SET UP OPPOSING LINES OF FORCE, BREAKING THE BACKS OF THE TIDAL WAVES BEFORE THEY FORM. - THEORETICALLY, THE PLAN WILL WORK. - UH, JUST ONE MOMENT, ADMIRAL. IF YOUR THEORY OF COUNTERFORCE DOESN'T WORK, THE TIDAL WAVES COULD DROWN MILLIONS. MASS EVACUATION NOW WOULD AT LEAST GIVE SOME OF THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE. MY PLAN WILL WORK! IF YOU ALARM THE WORLD NOW, YOU'LL CAUSE THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY WE MUST ASSUME. YOUR PLAN SEEMS TO BE BASED ON WISHFUL THINKING. DO YOU THINK SO, GENERAL? MAY I REMIND YOU THAT ON MY WAY TO THIS MEETING, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS AND FOUR OF MY BEST MEN WERE SHOT DOWN IN COLD BLOOD... BY AGENTS OF AN ENEMY POWER WITH WHICH WE'RE ALL TOO FAMILIAR. THIS WAS THEIR DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO STOP OPERATION COUNTERFORCE. THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS WISHFUL THINKING. I'LL ADMIT THAT YOUR PLAN COULD WORK, THEORETICALLY. BUT, UH, WHAT DO THESE HOSTILE FORCES GAIN BY STOPPING YOU? THEY WANT TO SEE WIDESPREAD DISASTER AND DEATH. THEY WANT TO SEE ALL GOVERNMENTS CRIPPLED, BECAUSE THIS WILL BRING THEM CLOSER TO THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL... WORLD DOMINATION. IF YOU TURN DOWN THIS PLAN, YOU'RE PLAYING DIRECTLY INTO THEIR HANDS! NOW, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. WE CAN'T DEBATE. WE'VE GOT TO ACT. GENTLEMEN, ARE THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS... BEFORE WE PUT THE MATTER TO A VOTE? VERY WELL. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE ADMIRAL'S PLAN. AYE. AYE. OPPOSED? NAY. THE "AYES" HAVE IT. OPERATION COUNTERFORCE WILL BE RECOMMENDED BY THIS COMMITTEE... TO THE PRESIDENT IMMEDIATELY. ADMIRAL, YOU SHOULD HAVE HIS APPROVAL WITHIN THE HOUR. THANK YOU. MEETING ADJOURNED. ADMIRAL. WELL, I HOPE WE DID THE RIGHT THING. WELL, ADMIRAL, A DARN SHAME ABOUT PHILLIPS, WASN'T IT? HE WAS A GOOD MAN. THE BEST. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR A REPLACEMENT. I DO. I'VE REQUISITIONED THE NAVY'S BEST SUBMARINE OFFICER FOR YOU. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A COMMANDER NAMED CRANE? LEE CRANE? OF COURSE. A FINE OFFICER. HE SERVED WITH ME ON THE OLD NAUTILUS. I'VE HAD SOME DEALINGS WITH HIM. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE'S... HE'S AN UNIMAGINATIVE, BY-THE-BOOK OFFICER. I'M NOT SURE THAT HE'S YOUR MAN. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH CRANE. WELL, YOU'VE GOT HIM. OH, AND, ADMIRAL, A WORD OF CAUTION. THEY KILLED PHILLIPS, BUT THEY WERE REALLY GUNNING FOR YOU, AND THEY STILL ARE. YOU BE CAREFUL, MY FRIEND. BE CAREFUL. THEY KILLED PHILLIPS, BUT THEY WERE REALLY GUNNING FOR YOU, AND THEY STILL ARE. YOU BE CAREFUL, MY FRIEND. BE CAREFUL. GENTLEMEN, THE NATURAL DISASTER WHICH THREATENS OUR ENEMIES... HAS PRESENTED US WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY... TO EXPLOIT THEIR MISFORTUNE. SEAVIEW'S MISSION IS TO FORESTALL THE DISASTER. AT ALL COSTS, THEIR MISSION MUST FAIL. HOLD IT! HOLD IT! 'TENTION! WELCOME ABOARD, CAPTAIN. COMMANDER CRANE ON LOAN FROM THE NAVY. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR THAT WARM WELCOME. BUT IT WASN'T WARM ENOUGH. YOUR SECURITY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED ME BEFORE I CAME ON BOARD. FROM NOW ON, THIS SHIP WILL REMAIN ON FULL ALERT. CARRY ON. YES, SIR. HEY, KOWALSKI, HOW'S YOUR JAW? HMM. HE MUST'VE BEEN WEARING BRASS KNUCKLES WHEN HE HIT ME. WHERE'S HE GET THAT JAZZ ABOUT NO SECURITY? WE CAUGHT HIM, DIDN'T WE? OKAY, KOWALSKI. STOW THE GAB. HEY, CHIEF, WHAT'S THE POOP ON THE NEW SKIP? WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DID LOOK UP HIS SERVICE RECORD. WHAT DID IT SAY? HE WAS THE INTERCOLLEGIATE MIDDLEWEIGHT BOXING CHAMPION. WELL, NO WONDER HE DECKED YOU, KOWALSKI. I STILL SAY HE WAS USIN' BRASS KNUCKS. OKAY, CUT OUT THE SCUTTLEBUTT. LET'S GET BACK TO WORK, ALL OF YA. GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, LEE. THANK YOU, ADMIRAL. DR. WILSON, THIS IS CHIP MORTON, OUR EXEC. I BELIEVE YOU KNOW OUR SKIPPER. WELCOME BOARD, DOCTOR. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO... HELLO, CRANE. HOW SOON CAN WE GET MOVING? - THE MOMENT WE GET OUR SPECIAL CARGO ABOARD. LEE, TELL THEM TO GET THE LEAD OUT. YES, SIR. I WANT A NORTHWEST HEADING AT FULL SPEED. MR. MORTON, HURRY THE DETAIL AND PREPARE TO GET UNDER WAY. AYE, AYE, SIR. COME IN. HERE'S THE REST OF YOUR GEAR, CAPTAIN. THANKS. I'LL STOW IT MYSELF. AYE, SIR. THAT JAW STILL HURT? IT'S A LITTLE SORE, SIR. SORRY I HAD TO DO THAT. YOU WERE JUST DOING YOUR JOB. IT'LL BE OKAY, SIR. FORGIVE ME FOR ASKING, CAPTAIN, BUT... DID YOU EVER SERVE UNDER THE ADMIRAL BEFORE? ONCE... MY FIRST SUBMARINE DUTY IN THE NAVY. WHY? OH, NOTHING, SIR. EXCEPT, WELL, THE ADMIRAL THINKS THIS CREW IS PRETTY SPECIAL. - DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? - AND MY TEST OF THEM IMPLIED CRITICISM. IS THAT IT? I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT, SIR. BUT THE ADMIRAL SURE WANTS TO SEE YOU IN THE OBSERVATION NOSE. WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO? THE COORDINATES, GENTLEMEN, ARE 0-6-3. PLUS 12? PLUS 12. OH, COME IN, LEE. EH, ADD THREE MORE. AND THAT'S IT, GENTLEMEN. YOU SENT FOR ME, ADMIRAL. YES, I, UH... I HAVE A REPORT HERE ABOUT THE SOMEWHAT, UH, UNORTHODOX WAY YOU CAME ABOARD. I EXPLAINED MY ACTION TO THE MEN, SIR. I WAS TESTING SECURITY. YOU SHOWED YOUR I.D. TO THE GUARDS IN THE GATE. THAT'S RIGHT, SIR. THE CHECK AT THE GATE WAS VERY THOROUGH. BUT I CONSIDER THE CREW ABOARD SOFT ON SECURITY. SOFT, COMMANDER? I ELUDED THE SENTRIES, AND I ACTUALLY GOT ABOARD. YOU DIDN'T GET VERY FAR, DID YOU? NO, SIR. I'LL HAVE TO ADMIT, I DIDN'T. YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR CREW, COMMANDER. THEY'RE NOT REGULAR NAVY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME DON'T THINK OF THEM... AS SOME RAGTAG CIVILIAN OUTFIT. THEY'RE HIGHLY SKILLED EXPERTS, EVERY ONE OF THEM. AND THEY CAN FUNCTION EQUALLY WELL IN MANY FIELDS. IS THAT UNDERSTOOD? YES, SIR. I UNDERSTAND. SOMEONE TOLD ME RECENTLY THAT YOU LACK IMAGINATION. FROM THE WAY YOU GOT ABOARD, I CONSIDER THAT REPORT, UH, EXAGGERATED. ADMIRAL NELSON. THIS IS NAVIGATION. YES, GO AHEAD. WE'RE NOW 12 MILES OUT, SIR. VERY WELL. YOU CAN OPEN YOUR SEALED ORDERS NOW, CAPTAIN. THEY'RE IN MY SAFE. COME ALONG TO MY CABIN. YES, SIR. ANY QUESTIONS? NO, SIR. THE ORDERS ARE QUITE CLEAR... TO COMPLETE THE MISSION AND TO REGARD SEAVIEW... AND HER ENTIRE CREW AS EXPENDABLE. IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE, THOUGH, CAPTAIN, I ASSUME YOU'LL BRING US ALL BACK ALIVE. I SORT OF PLANNED ON COMING BACK MYSELF, SIR. COFFEE? OH, NO, THANK YOU, SIR. UH, WITH YOUR PERMISSION, ADMIRAL. I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THE MISSION TO THE CREW. SORRY, LAD. THE CREW IS TO CONSIDER THIS A ROUTINE MISSION. TELL THEM COURSE AND DESTINATION. NOTHING ELSE. AYE, SIR. CONFUSED, LEE? COMPLETELY. IN THE NAVY, I ALWAYS TOLD MY CREW ALL MISSION DETAILS, ONCE WE WERE SAFELY AT SEA. LEE, IF THE MEN DISCOVER EVEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT... OF THE CALAMITY THREATENING THEIR FAMILIES, THIS SUB WILL BE A FLOATING PRESSURE COOKER. NOT KNOWING, THEY'VE ONLY THEMSELVES TO WORRY ABOUT. THEY'RE GOOD MEN. THEY WON'T CRACK. I UNDERSTAND, SIR. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU SHOULD KNOW. THERE'S A CERTAIN POWERFUL WORLDWIDE FORCE... WHICH WELCOMES THE VERY DISASTER WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT... THEY SEEM TO KNOW OUR PLANS AS SOON AS WE DO. AND THEY'LL GO TO ANY LENGTHS TO STOP US. - THIS SOUNDS LIKE A WARTIME MISSION, SIR. - IN A SENSE, WE ARE AT WAR. WE HAVE NO WAY OF GUESSING HOW OR WHERE THEY'LL STRIKE, BUT ONE THING I CAN PROMISE YOU, THEY WILL STRIKE. FROM NOW ON, WE RUN SUBMERGED. CARRY ON. AYE, AYE, SIR. TAKE HER DOWN, MR. MORTON. AYE, AYE, SIR. MR. O'BRIEN, PREPARE TO DIVE. AYE, AYE. CLEAR THE DECK! MAKE IT 90 FEET, MR. MORTON. NINETY FEET, SIR. DECKS CLEAR. VERY WELL. UP SCOPE. - PREPARE TO DIVE! - PREPARE TO DIVE. CLOSE ALL MAIN BALLAST TANK VENTS. STAND BY TO BLOW TANKS. BALLAST TANKS FULL. CLOSE THE VENTS! FLOOD BAY 8! FULL DIVE ON THE PLANES. FULL DIVE. SECURE THE AIR! ALL GREEN? ALL GREEN. DIVE! ALL DIVE! ALL DIVE. DECK'S AWASH. BOW IS UNDER. STERN GONE. LEFT FORWARD, TRIM FROM SEA. TRIM FROM SEA. SECURE PLANE. ALL AHEAD TWO-THIRDS. ALL AHEAD TWO-THIRDS. FINAL TRIM. FINAL TRIM, SIR. DEPTH 9-0 FEET AND TWO-THIRDS SPEED. ALL AHEAD FULL. FULL SPEED, SIR, IN THESE WATERS? THAT'S RIGHT, MR. MORTON. ALL AHEAD FULL. AYE, AYE, SIR. ALL AHEAD FULL. ALL AHEAD FULL. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? A ROUTINE CRUISE TO NO PLACE, AND HE WANTS TO KILL US GETTING THERE. NOW THIS IS THE SPOT FOR OUR COUNTERBLAST. DR. WILSON WILL TAKE READINGS ON THE ICE, WHILE I TAKE THEM HERE ON BOARD. WE WILL THEN TRIGGER THE NUCLEAR DEVICE TO EXPLODE... A SPLIT-SECOND FOLLOWING THE SECOND QUAKE. THE BOMB WEIGHS ABOUT A TON, CAPTAIN. NOW, YOUR JOB IS TO BRING YOUR SUB RIGHT SMACK UP AGAINST THE ICE... SO THAT I CAN UNLOAD IT. I KNOW MY JOB. THAT POLAR ICE IS TRICKY. IT COULD STAVE IN THE SIDE OF THE SUB. - YOUR SHIP'S EXPENDABLE. - NOT UNTIL AFTER I SET... - YOU AND THAT BOMB ON THE ICE. - NOT EVEN THEN. THERE'S STILL THE MATTER OF TRIANGULATION INVOLVING OUR COMPUTERS. AS FOR THE BOMB UNLOADING, THAT'S BEEN ANTICIPATED. FLOATS WILL HANDLE... WHAT'S THAT? I DON'T KNOW. DEPTH CHARGE ATTACK. RIG FOR DEPTH CHARGES. - STAY WITH IT. - RIG FOR DEPTH CHARGES. BATTLE STATIONS! BATTLE STATIONS! SONAR, WHAT'S THE RANGE OF THE ATTACK SHIP? NO SHIP CONTACT, SIR. MUST BE A PLANE. VERTICAL DIVE TO 1,000! HARD RIGHT RUDDER! VERTICAL DIVE TO 1,000. HARD RIGHT RUDDER. DEPTH 1,000. LEVEL OFF. HARD LEFT RUDDER. HARD LEFT RUDDER. MUST BE STILL IN THEIR PATTERN. STEADY AS SHE GOES. THEIR RADAR CAN'T REACH US NOW. CHIEF. SIR. CHECK DAMAGE CONTROL. DAMAGE CONTROL, MAKE REPORT. LIGHTS COMING ON. MISSILE AND TORPEDO FIRING SYSTEMS ARE KNOCKED OUT. I'VE GOT A REPAIR PARTY AT WORK ON 'EM ALREADY. CAPTAIN, WHAT THE DEVIL'S GOING ON? YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING NOW, LAD. MAKE IT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. THE MISSION WE'RE ON IS TOP SECRET. ALL I CAN TELL YOU AT THIS TIME IS THAT THERE ARE FORCES WHO ARE DETERMINED TO STOP US. THEY HAVEN'T SUCCEEDED YET. AND TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T, SEAVIEW IS NOW ON WAR ALERT. TROUBLE, SIR. SECURE FROM BATTLE STATIONS. LEE, SONAR HAS A PROBLEM. KEEPS GETTING INTERMITTENT READINGS. ALL STOP! ALL STOP. SONAR COMPLETELY DEAD. THE SCRAPING SOUNDED LIKE A CABLE DRAGGING ALONG THE HULL. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? THE DEPTH CHARGES MUST'VE WEAKENED OUR SONAR MAST. WE MAY HAVE LOST IT. THIS COULD END THE MISSION. FIND WILSON. AYE, AYE, SIR. WHAT'S HE DOIN' TO US? I TELL YA, THE GUY'S KICKED HIS COMPASS. KNOCK IT OFF, KOWALSKI. THE SKIPPER KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. YEAH? WELL, I DON'T. SOMEBODY'S SHOOTING AT US, AND THEY'RE NOT KIDDING. YOU HEARD HIM. WE'RE ON A TOP SECRET MISSION. I DON'T RECALL VOLUNTEERING. DID YOU? IT WOULD BE SUICIDE TO ATTEMPT NAVIGATION UNDER THE ICE WITHOUT SONAR. SIX DAYS TO ZERO... BARELY TIME FOR AN EVACUATION ORDER. THERE'S NO CHOICE LEFT. WE'VE BLOWN IT. NOT YET. IF THAT SCRAPING SOUND WAS THE MAST TEARING LOOSE, IT MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEARBY. - I DON'T SEE HOW THAT HELPS US. - I CAN PUT A PARTY OF DIVERS OUT. IF THEY CAN FIND THE GEAR, WE CAN SURFACE AND REPAIR THE DAMAGE WITHIN AN HOUR. - IT'S A LONG SHOT, LEE, BUT IT'S WORTH A RISK. - RIGHT, SIR. THREE DIVERS CAN DO THE JOB. I'LL NEED TWO VOLUNTEERS. - TWO? - I'M GOING WITH 'EM. OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT. AS SKIPPER YOU'RE TOO VALUABLE TO RISK ON A DIVING MISSION. IF WE FAIL, SIR, NOTHING ELSE IS GONNA MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE. - PICK YOUR MEN. - AYE, AYE, SIR. GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS. CAPTAIN, HERE ARE THE TWO BEST DIVERS IN THE CREW. WHERE'S THE SECOND ONE? YOU'RE LOOKIN' RIGHT AT HIM, SIR. SORRY, CHIEF. BUT I'M IN FIGHTIN' SHAPE, SIR. DON'T JUDGE HIS ABILITY BY HIS LOOKS, LEE. HE'S A FISH UNDERWATER. OKAY, CHIEF, SUIT UP. LOOKIN' FOR A FOURTH, GENTLEMEN? COUNT ME IN. THAT'S NO SWIMMING POOL OUT THERE, DOCTOR. ONLY EXPERTS GO ON THIS MISSION. YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I SHOULD GO. I HAPPEN TO BE THE BEST DIVER ON BOARD. FORGIVE ME. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. WE NEARLY LEFT WITHOUT YOU. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. NEXT. UP, UP, UP. THAT'S RIGHT. THE REST OF YOU. ALL RIGHT. FINE. ALL CLEAR? ALL CLEAR. ALL SET? ALL SET. ALL CLEAR. HOW DO YOU FEEL, LAD? LIKE A SORE LOSER. I DO MEAN SORE. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, GENTLEMEN. THANKS. THANKS. I TOLD YA I WAS THE BEST DIVER ABOARD. HERE, GET 'EM OFF. THIS IS THE ADMIRAL. SURFACE FOR REPAIRS. HOW MUCH ICE OVERHEAD NOW? ABOUT THE SAME, IRREGULAR... 10, 20 FEET. THAT STUFF IS HARD AS CEMENT. WE CAN'T RAM THROUGH. WE'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES ON THIS HEADING. CAPTAIN, THERE COULDN'T BE ANOTHER SHIP IN THESE WATERS, COULD THERE? ONLY ANOTHER SUB, WHY? I HAD A FLASH READING A FEW THOUSAND YARDS ASTERN. YOU THINK A SUB'S ON OUR TAIL, CAPTAIN? IT'S NOT LIKELY. LET'S KEEP TRACKING IT. IF WE DON'T FIND AN OPENING, WE'LL HAVE TO RISK BLASTING OUT. LESS THAN TWO HOURS TO ZERO. WE'VE GOT TO SURFACE. WE CAN'T USE MISSILES UNTIL FIRING SYSTEM'S REPAIRED. HOW LONG IS THAT LIKELY TO TAKE? WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY. IT'S BEEN KNOCKED OUT EVER SINCE THE ATTACK. THEY'LL GET IT FIXED ANYTIME NOW. THEY'D BETTER. CAPTAIN. UNIDENTIFIED FAST PROPELLERS BEARING 0-9-0. SHORT-SCALE PINGING. A SUB. THEY DON'T GIVE UP EASILY, DO THEY? SIGNAL DEAD AHEAD. RANGE 1,000 YARDS. REQUEST INSTRUCTIONS.

THIS IS YOUR BABY, ADMIRAL. HOW MUCH PRESSURE CAN SHE TAKE? THIRTY-FOUR HUNDRED ON THE DRAWING BOARD. CONFIRM DEPTH. TWENTY-THREE HUNDRED FEET. - DEPTH! REPEAT! - THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET. WE CAN TAKE MORE PRESSURE THAN SHE CAN. SHE'LL BLOW. SHE'D BETTER. THEY'RE STILL DIVING. - DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY. - FOLLOW THEM DOWN. CLOSE IN FOR THE KILL. WE'RE BELOW 3,000. WE CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE DEPTH. THEY MUST NOT ESCAPE. DESTROY THEM. WE CAN'T GO ANY DEEPER. - TELL HIM HIS ORDERS ARE CLEAR. - FOLLOW THEM DOWN. CHECK FOR DAMAGE. AYE, SIR. DAMAGE CONTROL, MAKE CHECK.

ANY INDICATION HOW CLOSE THEY CAME TO A DIRECT HIT? NONE, SIR. I'VE ORDERED RADAR TO KEEP SCANNING FOR THE PLANE. IT MAY BE BACK. IF THEY GOT WILSON, THEY WON'T HAVE TO COME BACK. LEE, IT MAY BE ALL OVER. ADMIRAL, WHAT ARE THE ORDERS NOW? STAND FAST. WAIT. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO. MY LEG. I THINK IT'S BROKEN. ADMIRAL, I'M GETTING A WEAK SIGNAL ON WILSON'S WAVELENGTH. PIPE IT IN. SEAVIEW TO WILSON. READ YOU, ADMIRAL. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WELL, THE DEVICE IS UNDAMAGED. BUT THE SNOWCAT'S BURIED UNDER A TON OF ICE. MALONE'S HIT IN THE LEG. I CAUGHT A FRAGMENT IN THE SHOULDER. DOCTOR, LISTEN. THE SECOND QUAKE IS DUE... IN EXACTLY THREE HOURS AND 44 MINUTES. YEAH. I'M SETTING THE TIMER NOW. SHE'S ALL SET. NOW, YOU NEED THREE HOURS TO GET THE SUB SAFELY AWAY FROM THE BLAST. THIS MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO DIVE IN 44 MINUTES. WAIT. WAIT. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO GET BACK? TOO LONG. MALONE CAN'T MOVE. AND WITH MY SHOULDER, I CAN'T DIG OUT THE SNOWCAT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE STUCK HERE. YOU'D BETTER GET THE SUB OUT OF HERE. SO LONG, ADMIRAL. WE'VE GOT 44 MINUTES, SIR. IF I CAN FIND 'EM, AND UNCOVER THE SNOWCAT, I COULD BRING 'EM BACK IN TIME. - AND IF YOU CAN'T DIG IT OUT? - THEN YOU'VE GOT NO CHOICE, SIR. PULL THE PLUG AND SCRAMBLE. THIRTY-TWO MINUTES TO GO, ADMIRAL. SIR, WILL THEY GET MALONE BACK IN TIME? I DON'T KNOW, LAD. WE DIVE IN 32 MINUTES... WHETHER THEY'RE BACK OR NOT. YOU MEAN, SIR, THAT THE CAPTAIN WENT OUT THERE KNOWING THAT? HE DID. DETECTION GEAR REPORTS THE POLAR CAP NUCLEAR DEVICE... HAS SURVIVED OUR ATTACK. IMPOSSIBLE. RECHECK THE READINGS. THEY'VE BEEN RECHECKED, SIR. THE DEVICE HAS DEFINITELY BEEN TRIGGERED FOR DETONATION. RECALL THE DRONE. WE'LL ATTACK AGAIN. AND THIS TIME, DO NOT FAIL. WE MISSED THEM. WE'VE GOT 15 MINUTES LEFT. IF WE DON'T FIND 'EM NOW, WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT. I'LL TRY AGAIN. WILSON! THIS IS CRANE! CAN YOU READ ME, WILSON? COME IN! I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU. WHERE ARE YOU? WILSON! I'M GOING TO FIRE A FLARE.

IN 15 SECONDS, WE'RE GONNA CATCH THE FULL FORCE... OF TWO GIGANTIC EXPLOSIONS. NOW, ALL HANDS, BRACE YOURSELVES. FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE... NOSE CAMERA! YOU IDIOT! YOU'RE WRONG! YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT! HOW MUCH WATER DO WE HAVE? RUNNING AT 500. THERE'S 650 LEFT FROM KEEL TO BOTTOM. MAYBE TOO LOW TO DIVE. WE'VE GOT TO! ALL AHEAD FULL! TAKE HER DOWN TO 1,000! STAND BY. STAND BY. ATTENTION. ATTENTION, PLEASE. DESPITE OUR EVERY EFFORT, NELSON AND HIS SUBMARINE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THEIR MISSION. AN UNFORGIVABLE BLUNDER HAS BEEN MADE. WE HAVE OVERESTIMATED OURSELVES, AND UNDERESTIMATED THE POWER OF OUR ADVERSARY. WE MUST NEVER AGAIN REPEAT THIS MISTAKE. GENTLEMEN, WE MAKE PORT IN TWO HOURS. ALREADY? WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO THANK YOU PROPERLY... FOR SAVING MY PRECIOUS HIDE. OH, I FIGURED THAT'D MAKE US EVEN. BESIDES, I COULDN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THE BEST DIVER ABOARD, COULD I? WELL, HE'S GOT A POINT. WELL, LEE, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY WITH THE NAVY. I SUPPOSE SO, SIR, NOW THAT SEAVIEW'S JOB IS FINISHED. SEAVIEW'S JOB IS NEVER FINISHED. AS LONG AS THERE ARE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES IN THE WORLD, AS LONG AS THERE ARE SECRETS OF NATURE TO BE PROBED, THERE'LL BE WORK FOR US... ON MISSIONS JUST AS VITAL AND AS DANGEROUS AS THIS ONE. CAPTAIN, RADIO MESSAGE FROM THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. OH, THANKS, CURLEY. - BAD NEWS? - I DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE TELLING ME I'M OUT OF THE NAVY. NATURALLY. HOW ELSE COULD YOU ACCEPT THE POST OF PERMANENT CAPTAIN OF THE SEAVIEW? THAT IS, IF YOU WANT IT.
