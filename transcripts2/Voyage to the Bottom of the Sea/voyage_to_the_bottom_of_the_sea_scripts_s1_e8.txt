 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964–1968): Season 1, Episode 8 - The Village of Guilt - full transcript 
 In the Fjords of a small Norwegian fishing village a small boat manned by three drunken fishermen is attacked by what appears to be a giant sea monster. When Admiral Nelson hears of this he is fascinated by it and takes the Seaview to the Norway to investigate and interview the one survivor. The villagers are not happy to see them and reluctant to talk and answer questions. Someone is so desperate to keep their silence that the survivor is murdered before he could talk. With no one willing to talk Nelson is preparing to leave when they discover evidence of giant sea life. Nelson is determined to solve this mystery.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE NEWS TODAY... [Shuts Off Radio] YOU BELIEVE IT? SEA MONSTERS? EVEN IF I SAW ONE I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. A TRUE SKEPTIC, HUH? - DO YOU BELIEVE IT? - IT'S POSSIBLE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SEA MONSTERS DO EXIST AT EXTREME OCEAN DEPTHS. FORTUNATELY, NONE OF THEM ARE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN INCHES IN SIZE. - OH, WELL... - NOW DON'T DISMISS IT SO CASUALLY. THERE ARE DEPTHS WE'VE NEVER REACHED. NOW WHO'S TO SAY WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE? AND WE'LL NEVER FIND OUT IF MEN CLOSE THEIR MIND TO THE IMPROBABLE... JUST BECAUSE IT IS IMPROBABLE. I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO CATCH UP ON. I'LL SEE YOU AT LUNCH. WELL, THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF YOU. OH, NOT ME. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN SEA MONSTERS. BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. NO HURRY, SIR. [Morton On Speaker] ADMIRAL, THERE'S A FURTHER RADIO REPORT ON THE SEA MONSTER. THANK YOU, CHIP. PIPE IT IN. [Man On Radio] THE SURVIVOR, JOHAN ROLVAAG, DESCRIBES THE MONSTER AS A SNAKELIKE GIANT... WITH MOTTLED YELLOW-AND-BLACK SCALES... AND CIRCULAR SUCTION CUPS ALONG ITS BODY. THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN REPORTS... THAT ROLVAAG'S BODY IS A MASS OF CIRCULAR WELTS AND HOLES. KILL IT, CHIP. [Radio Shuts Off] CEPHALOPOD! I BEG YOUR PARDON? A SNAKELIKE AFFAIR WITH MOTTLED YELLOW-AND-BLACK SCALES, CIRCULAR CUPS ALONG THE BODY. THAT'S A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF AN APPENDAGE OF THE CEPHALOPOD ORDER OCTOPODA. IN PLAIN ENGLISH, LEE, AN OCTOPUS. AN OCTOPUS IN THOSE WATERS AND THAT SIZE? IMPOSSIBLE. I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, BUT THE DESCRIPTION FITS. BUT I'VE CAUGHT AN OCTOPUS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. THEY'RE SMALL AND SHY. TRUE, BUT IF ONE REACHED THE SIZE THAT POOR FISHERMAN SAYS, IT COULD GIVE ANYTHING AFLOAT A RUN FOR ITS MONEY... AND I MEAN A RUN. - YOU MAKE IT SOUND AS THOUGH IT REALLY EXISTS. - IF THE STORY IS TRUE, THE POSSIBILITIES FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARE FANTASTIC. LEE, HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO SET A COURSE FOR TANA? - ABOUT THREE MINUTES. - SET IT. AYE, SIR. THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. SET COURSE A-24. [On Speaker] AYE, SIR! TAKE HER DOWN, MR. MORTON. AYE, AYE, SIR. MR. O'BRIEN, PREPARE TO DIVE. [O'Brien On Speaker] AYE, AYE. CLEAR THE DECK! MAKE IT 90 FEET, MR. MORTON. 90 FEET, SIR. [O'Brien] DECKS CLEARED. VERY WELL. [Klaxon Blaring] [Men Chattering] [Man On Speaker] PREPARE TO DIVE. PREPARE TO DIVE. [On Speaker] CLOSE ALL MAIN BALLAST TANK VENTS. STAND BY TO BLOW TANKS. BALLAST TANKS FULL. CLOSE THE VENTS. FLOOD NEGATIVE. FULL DIVE ON THE PLANES. FULL DIVE. - SECURE THE AIR. ALL GREEN? - ALL GREEN. DIVE! ALL DIVE! ALL DIVE! [Crane] DECKS AWASH. BOW IS UNDER. STERN GONE. FLOOD FORWARD. TRIM FROM SEA. TRIM FROM SEA. SECURE FLOODING. ALL AHEAD TWO-THIRDS. ALL AHEAD TWO-THIRDS. FINAL TRIM. FINAL TRIM, SIR. DEPTH 90 FEET AND TWO-THIRDS SPEED. ALL AHEAD FULL. SIR, ALL AHEAD FULL? THAT'S RIGHT, MR. MORTON. WE'RE HEADED FOR NORWAY... IN A HURRY. DOWN SCOPE. SHE'S ALL YOURS, MR. MORTON. TAKE HER UP. AYE, AYE, SIR. PREPARE TO SURFACE. PREPARE TO SURFACE. [Klaxon Blaring] SURFACE! SURFACE! BLOW BALLAST TANKS FORE AND AFT. STEADY AS SHE GOES. STEADY AS SHE GOES. [Chattering] [Chattering] ADMIRAL NELSON? THAT'S RIGHT. HOW DO YOU DO? I'M MARIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED NEWS SERVICE. WELL, IF YOU'VE COME TO SEE THE SURVIVOR, YOUR TIMING IS EXCELLENT. THE DOCTOR PROMISED US WE COULD SEE ROLVAAG TODAY. LOOKS AS IF HE'S GOING TO PULL THROUGH. - WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS SEA MONSTER STORY, ADMIRAL? - I'LL TELL YOU AFTER... I TALK WITH ROLVAAG. WHERE'S EVERYBODY GONE? [Reporter] WELL, THE VILLAGERS HAVEN'T BEEN VERY FRIENDLY. WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THE SEA MONSTER? NOTHING. THEY'RE VERY SUPERSTITIOUS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS. - WHY DON'T WE GO TALK WITH ROLVAAG? - CERTAINLY. MAY I SHOW YOU THE WAY? [Screaming] [Muffled Groans] [Knocking] - GOOD DAY. - DR. ANDERSON TOLD YOU HE WILL CALL... WHEN YOU CAN SEE MR. ROLVAAG. YES, I KNOW, BUT YOU SEE... I'D LIKE TO TALK TO THE DOCTOR BEFORE THAT, IF POSSIBLE. I'M ADMIRAL NELSON. [Man] WON'T YOU PLEASE COME IN? ADMIRAL, I AM DR. ANDERSON. I'VE ENJOYED MANY OF YOUR STIMULATING ARTICLES. THANK YOU. THIS IS MY CAPTAIN, LEE CRANE. HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU DO? ROLVAAG IS STILL UNDER SEDATION. LET ME TAKE A LOOK. ROLVAAG? HE'S DEAD. ♪♪ [Concertina: Polka] [Chattering] ♪♪ [Stops] [Chattering Stops] FRIENDLY, AREN'T THEY? MAY WE SIT DOWN? I WAS EXPECTING FRIENDS. WE WON'T STAY LONG. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE RUDE. PLEASE SIT DOWN. WHAT DO THEY THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO THEM? OH, THEY'RE FISHERMEN AND SUPERSTITIOUS. YOUR SUBMARINE IN THE FJORD IS AN ILL OMEN. YOUR ORDER, GENTLEMEN? ALE. THE SAME. WE'RE ALL QUITE SHOCKED BY YOUR PATIENT'S DEATH. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? I CAN'T. I'M REALLY NOT A NURSE, YOU KNOW. I'M A SCHOOLTEACHER HERE IN TOWN, AND I WAS JUST HELPING DR. ANDERSON OUT. OH, BY THE WAY, HE SAID TO SAY GOOD-BYE. HE LEFT THIS EVENING WITH THE REPORTERS. THE REPORTERS ARE GONE? ONCE THE ONLY EYEWITNESS DIED, THEY HAD NO STORY. - YOU ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT. - WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE DOCTOR? DID HE SAY ANY MORE ABOUT THE CAUSE OF ROLVAAG'S DEATH? NO. ONLY THAT HE DIED FROM THE SEVERE INJURIES HE RECEIVED IN THE ACCIDENT. - IS THE WORD "ACCIDENT" HIS OR YOURS? - MINE. THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A SEA MONSTER? THREE HALF-DRUNKEN MEN IN A BROKEN-DOWN BOAT... TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY HOME FROM A PARTY? I FIND IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE COULD TAKE ROLVAAG'S STORY SERIOUSLY. IT'S POSSIBLE. YOU SEE, IF WE COULD FIND THE BOAT, WE'D KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH TO THE STORY. LOOKING FOR THE BOAT IN THE TRONDER FJORD... WOULD BE LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN THE NORTH SEA. IT'S OVER TWO MILES DEEP IN PLACES, YOU KNOW. WELL, YOU DON'T MIND IF WE TAKE A LOOK? I'M A STUBBORN MAN. IT'S BEEN VERY PLEASANT TALKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. [Chattering] CAN'T FIGURE THIS ONE OUT. SOMEHOW, I GET THE CLEAR AND DISTINCT FEELING... THAT SHE'S JUST AS ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF US AS THE REST OF THEM. I ALSO HAVE THE FEELING THAT THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN HER SIMPLE EXPLANATION. IT IS SAFE NOW. WE CAN GO IN. NO SIGN OF ANYTHING. THEY'RE STARTING TO RETRACE. NO SIGN OF ANYTHING YET, SIR. THEY'VE COMPLETED THE ARC AND ARE STARTING TO RETRACE. CALL IN THE MINI-SUB. WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME. CHIEF, TELL 'EM TO RETURN. AYE, SIR. OUR SCHOOLTEACHER WAS RIGHT. TRYING TO FIND A BOAT IN THE TRONDER FJORD... IS LIKE TRYING TO FIND IT IN THE NORTH SEA. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? MM, HEAD FOR HOME, I SUPPOSE. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO GET UNDER WAY? ABOUT AN HOUR. ALL RIGHT. CARRY ON. [On Speaker] CAPTAIN, THIS IS SONAR. PICKING UP SOME ODD SOUNDS. HOW DO YOU READ IT? LONG-SCALE PINGING. 3,000 YARDS, BEARING 2-7-5, RELATIVE. ANOTHER SUBMARINE? IT'S POSSIBLE. DO YOU READ PROPELLERS? NO, SIR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. RAISE YOUR GAIN TO FULL AND FEED IT INTO THE MIKE. PIPE SONAR DOWN HERE. [Deep-pitched Hum] HOW DO YOU READ IT, LEE? YOU BEAT ME TO IT. I WAS GONNA ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. GET CURLEY UP HERE. CHIEF JONES, LAY FORWARD TO THE NOSE ON THE DOUBLE. CURLEY'S A HUMAN SONAR. IF HE CAN'T IDENTIFY IT, THEN THE MACHINE MUST BE HAVING A FIT. [On Speaker] RANGE CLOSING, SIR. WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S COMING CLOSER. YES, SIR. HOW DO YOU READ THIS, CURLEY? [Deep-pitched Hum] THAT'S A NEW ONE ON ME, CAPTAIN. CLOSEST THING TO WHALES I'VE EVER HEARD. [Laughing] WHALES? WELL, TO ME IT SOUNDS LIKE WHALES. FIRST SEA MONSTERS, NOW WHALES. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW... [Loud Rattling] SOUND GENERAL QUARTERS! [On Speaker] BATTLE STATIONS! BATTLE STATIONS! CONTROL ROOM, IDENTIFY ATTACKER. NO MOTORS, CAPTAIN, TORPEDOES, NO NOTHIN'. LEE, WE BETTER MOVE OUT OF HERE. AYE, SIR. HOLY COW! LOOK AT THAT. - WHAT ARE THEY? - [Scoffs] WHO'D EVER BELIEVE IT? LEE, DID YOU EVER HOOK A CATFISH WHEN YOU WERE A KID? [Crane] THOSE ARE CATFISH? [Curley] WOW. LET'S TAKE A LONG LOOK AROUND HERE. AYE, SIR. MR. MORTON, TAKE HER UP. [Morton] AYE, SIR. ADMIRAL, HOW IN THE WORLD CAN CATFISH GROW THAT BIG? WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE. [Speaking Norwegian] HELLO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME ABOARD? [Speaking Norwegian] [Speaking Norwegian] I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, YOUNG FELLA, SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME? [Speaking Norwegian] OH, GARTERN, ASK HIM IF HE'S EVER SEEN THE SEA MONSTER. [Speaking Norwegian] - ASK HIM IF HE KNOWS ANYONE WHO HAS. - [Speaking Norwegian] DOES HE KNOW WHAT PART OF THE TRONDER FJORD... THE MEN WERE CROSSING WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED? [Speaking Norwegian] HE SAYS THE MONSTER DIDN'T ATTACK THEM IN THE TRONDER FJORD. IT WAS THE FORBIDDEN AREA, LUDER FJORD. LUDER FJORD? WE COULD HAVE LOOKED FOREVER AND NEVER FOUND IT. [Man Yelling] [Speaking Norwegian] THEY DELIBERATELY STEERED US TO THE WRONG PLACE. WHAT ARE THEY TRYIN' TO HIDE? THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. HEAD FOR THE LUDER FJORD. AYE, SIR. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE IN LUDER FJORD, SO STAY ALERT, BE READY FOR ANYTHING. LET'S GO. [Air Hissing] ALL SECURE. [Man On Speaker] ALL SECURE. TAKE THIS. SEEMS TO BE PART OF SOME KIND OF SEA ANIMAL. WE HACKED OFF THIS PIECE, BUT THE REST WAS TOO LARGE TO BRING IN. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT NOW, GENTLEMEN. DO YOU THINK IT'S PART OF A SEA MONSTER? A SMALL PART. A VERY, VERY, SMALL PART. THEY MUST HAVE FOUND THE DORY... RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES ALL THIS TIME. YOU SUPPOSE THEY ALSO FOUND THE TENTACLE THAT WAS HACKED OFF? WHAT CAN THEY PROVE? NO ONE IN THE VILLAGE WILL TALK. IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT BOY, THEY'D BE GONE BY NOW. I WAS VERY FOOLISH TO LET IT GO THIS FAR. WE MUST STOP THE EXPERIMENTS. YES, LARS, PLEASE. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT AS EASY AS THAT. [Older Man] BUT THREE MEN KILLED! WE MUST STOP. [Woman] BEFORE THERE ARE MORE DEATHS. [Lars] THERE WILL BE NO MORE. THE FISHERMEN ARE FRIGHTENED OF LUDER FJORD. THEY WON'T GO NEAR IT. THREE MEN DID. THEY DIED. THREE DRUNKEN FISHERMEN... GOING SOMEPLACE THEY HAD NO BUSINESS TO GO. IS IT OUR FAULT THEY IGNORED OUR WARNINGS? THE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. THE AUTHORITIES WILL NEVER KNOW. EVERY FISHERMAN IN THE VILLAGE KNOWS. THEY WON'T TALK. WE PAY THEM WELL FOR THEIR HELP. - THEY SHARE IN THE GUILT OF THESE DEATHS. - LARS, PLEASE. I HAVE DONE NOTHING I'M ASHAMED OF! WE ARE MAKING A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE. ARE WE TO THROW IT AWAY JUST BECAUSE OF SOME IDIOTIC ACCIDENT? THESE EXPERIMENTS MADE SENSE IN THE BEGINNING, BUT NOT ANYMORE. THIS MONSTER MUST BE DESTROYED, OR I'LL GO TO THE POLICE. SO. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WILL YOU GO TO THE POLICE TOO? YOU ARE MY HUSBAND. I WILL DESTROY IT... AFTER MY WORK IS COMPLETED, NOT BEFORE. LARS IS RIGHT. THE FISHERMEN ARE FRIGHTENED. I'VE HEARD THEM TALKING. OH, UNCLE, I LOVE YOU. I FEEL EVERYTHING YOU FEEL. PLEASE DON'T GO TO THE POLICE. HE IS MY HUSBAND. ALL RIGHT. I WON'T TELL. SIT DOWN, GENTLEMEN. SIT DOWN. WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS SO FANTASTIC, I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT MYSELF, BUT I'VE TESTED AND RETESTED AND THE RESULTS ARE INDISPUTABLE. THIS VILE CONTAINS A DERIVATIVE OF PITUITARY GONADOTROPIN... EXTRACTED FROM THE TENTACLE YOU FOUND IN THE FJORD. IT'S A MANUFACTURED PRODUCT... USED MAINLY TO PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF CELLS, SO, IT'S MORE THAN POSSIBLE THAT OUR MONSTER IS THE RESULT OF SOMEONE'S EXPERIMENTATION. [On Speaker] CAPTAIN, WASHINGTON COMING THROUGH. DR. THOMPSON. EXCUSE ME. CRANE SPEAKING. OH, YES, DOCTOR. GOOD. YES. VERY GOOD, DOCTOR. YES. THANK YOU. SEAVIEW OUT. [Hangs Up Receiver] THAT'S THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT ANY SUBSCRIBERS... TO SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN THIS VICINITY. THERE'S ONE LIVING RIGHT HERE IN TANA. - OSKAR DALGREN. - OSKAR DALGREN. I KNOW THE NAME. HE HAS TO BE AN OLD MAN NOW. HE WAS PRETTY IMPORTANT AT ONE TIME. HE DISAPPEARED, I THINK, ABOUT, UH, TEN YEARS AGO. WHAT'S HE DOING IN THIS FORSAKEN SPOT? WE'LL SOON FIND OUT. LET'S SEE. DALGREN... OSKAR DALGREN. YEAH. HERE WE ARE. DALGREN'S LAST PAPER TO THE ROYAL SCIENCE ACADEMY... WAS ON THE GERMINATION AND CROSSBREEDING OF MARINE LIFE. HE AND A MAN NAMED "LARS MATTSON" ACTUALLY MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS. HIS THESIS WAS THAT UNDER PROPER BREEDING, THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH SEA LIFE TO FEED THE ENTIRE WORLD AT AN INFINITESIMAL COST. THAT'S A PRETTY ADMIRABLE THESIS, BUT HOW DOES IT TIE IN WITH THE SEA MONSTER? I'M BEGINNING TO GET A VAGUE IDEA, IF WE FIND DALGREN, WE'LL FIND THE ANSWER. OSKAR DALGREN. DALGREN? OSKAR DALGREN? I KNOW NO ONE BY THAT NAME IN TOWN. WE HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT HE DOES LIVE HERE. YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL US... BECAUSE WE'LL FIND OUT EVENTUALLY. YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN, GENTLEMEN. THERE IS NO ONE BY THAT NAME IN TANA. [Nelson] ALL RIGHT. HAVE IT YOUR WAY, MY FRIEND, BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM, TELL HIM I'M LOOKING FOR HIM... AND THAT I KNOW ALL ABOUT HIS EXPERIMENTS. [Man Speaking Norwegian] [Speaking Norwegian] THAT WAS A WILD SHOT. I KNOW, BUT IF IT ISN'T TRUE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. IF IT IS, IT SHOULD START THINGS MOVING PRETTY FAST. DALGREN PICKED A COZY HIDEAWAY ALL RIGHT. A MAN COULD DISAPPEAR FOREVER UP HERE. ARE YOU PRETTY SURE HE'S HERE IN TANA AND STILL EXPERIMENTING? WELL, A SCIENTIST LIKE DALGREN DOESN'T VEGETATE. THERE'S AN IRRESISTIBLE URGE THAT KEEPS DRIVING MEN LIKE HIM. I'VE GOT AN IRRESISTIBLE URGE TO GET BACK TO THE SEAVIEW... AND JUMP INTO A TALL, HOT DRINK. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, LEE? [Exhales] THAT WAS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. GET AN AWFUL HEADACHE FROM THAT ONE. SOMEONE HAD JUST THAT IN MIND. [Gunshot] YOU SURE FLUSHED A LOT OF ACTION OUT IN THAT PUB. THAT WASN'T QUITE WHAT I WAS THINKING OF. [Gunshot] NOW LOOK, WE'RE SITTING DUCKS HERE, ADMIRAL. I'M GONNA SCOUT AROUND HERE AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THERE'S PLENTY OF COVER THAT WAY. NOW DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES. OKAY. - DALGREN! - [Gunshot] [Grunting] HE'S ALL YOURS, ADMIRAL. WHO SENT YOU? DALGREN? NO! I KNOW NO DALGREN. WHY WERE YOU TRYING TO KILL US? ANSWER THE QUESTION. WHY WERE YOU SHOOTING AT US? A MAN HIRED ME... A STRANGER. HE TOLD ME TO FRIGHTEN YOU AWAY. FRIGHTEN US? YOU ALMOST MURDERED US. I'M A CRACK SHOT. I SAY ONLY FRIGHTEN. I DO NOT KILL. WE WON'T GET ANY MORE OUT OF HIM, LEE. MAYBE THE AUTHORITIES WILL HAVE BETTER LUCK... LET HIM GO, LEE! [Sighs] WELL, NOW WHAT? WELL, WE'VE COUNTERED THEIR FIRST MOVE. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY TRY NEXT. COME ON. [Growling] [Mouths Word] YOU TAKE LOTS OF CHANCES GOING DOWN THERE THAT WAY. I RATHER ENJOY IT. BESIDES, MY CHILD MUST BE FED. I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL. THIS IS A DANGEROUS BUSINESS. SIGRID. ADMIRAL NELSON KNOWS ABOUT MY UNCLE AND THE EXPERIMENTS, LARS. WHAT WILL YOU DO? DOES YOUR UNCLE KNOW? NO. GOOD. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT ADMIRAL NELSON FOUND OUT, BUT AS LONG AS WE KEEP THE TWO OF THEM APART, WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR. ADMIRAL NELSON WILL BE OUT OF HERE IN A WEEK. I GIVE YOU MY WORD. DEAR SIGRID, IT WON'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER... JUST A FEW MORE MONTHS. YOU'LL AGREE IT WAS WORTH IT. YOU WON'T BE SORRY. I PROMISE. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I DON'T KNOW. I'M COLD. I... I HAVE NO FEELING. I'M SHRIVELED INSIDE. DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. SIGRID, I TOLD YOU. I'VE DONE NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. I EXPLAINED ALL THAT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? FROM ROLVAAG'S BED. LARS, YOU KILLED HIM. I COULDN'T TAKE A CHANCE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE KNEW OR SAW. I HAD TO DO IT. NOTHING IS GOING TO STAND IN MY WAY. NOTHING. AND NO ONE. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. SIGRID, THIS HASN'T BEEN EASY FOR ME, BUT I CAN'T JUST THROW AWAY YEARS OF WORK. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND. I'LL TRY. IF DALGREN EVER FINDS OUT ABOUT ROLVAAG... SIR. [Ticking] CAPTAIN CRANE, SMALL, UNIDENTIFIABLE OBJECT... COMING IN BELOW US ON STARBOARD SIDE. KEEP A READING ON IT. LET'S GO! [Ticking] [Ticking] [On Speaker] UNIDENTIFIABLE OBJECT DIRECTLY BELOW US. SIR. CAPTAIN, THERE'S A MAGNETIC TIMING DEVICE ON OUR HULL. SOUND GENERAL QUARTERS. SOUND GENERAL QUARTERS. BATTLE STATIONS! BATTLE STATIONS! [Klaxon Blaring] CURLEY, GET MY SUIT IN A HURRY. AYE, SIR. - SECURE ALL HATCHES. - AYE, SIR. SECURE ALL HATCHES! - [Klaxon Blares] [Sonar Pinging] CAPTAIN, IT'S STILL TICKING. ALL SECURE? [On Speaker] ALL SECURE. [Ticking] [Air Hissing] ALL SECURE? [On Speaker] ALL SECURE. THAT'S JUST A SPRING-WOUND TIMER, SKIPPER. THAT'S NO BOMB. THAT DIVER MUST HAVE BEEN OUT OF HIS MIND. WHERE'S THE ADMIRAL? WELL, HE TOOK OFF AFTER HIM. NOW WHY WOULD A GUY PUT A STUPID THING LIKE THIS ON OUR HULL? I THINK IT'S A TRAP, CURLEY. IF IT IS, THE ADMIRAL'S SWIMMING RIGHT INTO IT. THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. ALL AVAILABLE DIVERS REPORT TO THE MISSILE ROOM ON THE DOUBLE. [Lars] COME IN, ADMIRAL. COME IN. WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. PUT THE GUN AWAY. COME IN, PLEASE. YOU ARE MOST WELCOME, SIR. I AM LARS MATTSON. AH, YES. DALGREN'S ASSISTANT. FORMER ASSISTANT, MY DEAR ADMIRAL NELSON. YOU MIGHT SAY THE PUPIL HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE MASTER. AND THIS IS MY ASSISTANT, OTTO HASSLER. UH, HE WAS THE BAIT THAT LED YOU HERE. YOU'RE QUITE A PSYCHOLOGIST. I FELT SURE ANY FELLOW SCIENTIST WOULD BE FASCINATED WITH MY LABORATORY. HERE. HERE. I'VE CROSSBRED ONE OF THE CYPRINIDAE... A FISH OF IMPORTANCE TO HUMAN BEINGS BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY GIVES THEM FOOD, BUT IS THE SOURCE FOR CERTAIN RARE CHEMICALS. NOW, CROSSING HIM WITH ONE OF THE PYGOCENTRUS VARIETIES... A GREAT FIGHTING FISH... I HAVE MADE HIM MORE THAN A MATCH FOR THOSE WHO WOULD DEVOUR HIM. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. BASIC. SIMPLE. IN A FEW MONTHS... WEEKS, EVEN... I WILL HAVE THE ANSWER TO MARINE-LIFE GROWTH. I WILL LITERALLY BE ABLE TO CREATE ANY FORM OF LIFE TO ANY SIZE I DESIRE. SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT THEORY FOR YEARS. IT WILL BE QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. IT WILL BE THE GREATEST STEP FORWARD IN MARINE BIOLOGY. MY NAME WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY! YOU KEEP REFERRING TO YOUR NAME, YOUR WORK. HOW DOES OSKAR DALGREN FIT INTO ALL THIS? OSKAR DALGREN... IS A GOOD SCIENTIST, BUT HE IS AN OLD MAN, A-A TORTOISE... TOO BAD. BUT YOU WILL GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR WHAT HE'S DONE. THE ACCOMPLISHMENT IS ALL MINE, ADMIRAL. WHAT I DID I DID WITH MY OWN BRAIN AND NO ONE ELSE'S. I SUPPOSE IT'S HARD FOR A MAN IN YOUR POSITION TO UNDERSTAND... WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GREATNESS, TO SEE HIM GET THE ACCLAIM THAT SHOULD BE YOURS. OSKAR DALGREN DID THAT TO ME FOR YEARS. YOU'VE YET TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SEA FREAK. NOW YOU BRING ME TO THE CRUX OF WHY I WANTED YOU HERE. I WANTED NOT ONLY TO SHOW YOU MY CREATIONS, I WANTED YOU ACTUALLY TO BE A PART OF THEM. THE SEAVIEW IS YOUR CREATION, ADMIRAL. THE "SEA FREAK," AS YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT, IS MINE. I HAVE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY... OF TESTING ITS RESISTANCES AGAINST MODERN WEAPONS. THE PRESENCE OF YOUR SUBMARINE IN THE FJORD GIVES ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. YOU'RE GAMBLING WITH THE LIVES OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED MEN. I REGRET THAT, ADMIRAL, BUT EVENTUALLY MILLIONS WILL BENEFIT. I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO COME HERE, ADMIRAL. YOUR PRESENCE HERE ENDANGERS MY WORK. NOW YOU LEAVE ME NO ALTERNATIVE. THE SUBMARINE IS DIVING. AH. TO LOOK FOR YOU UNDOUBTEDLY, ADMIRAL. NOW YOU COME WITH ME. I WILL SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. [Knocking] SIGRID! ADMIRAL, I'M SORRY. THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SORRY FOR. I'M TAKING THE ADMIRAL DOWN BELOW... TO SEE MY CREATION. YOUR MONSTER. I'M LETTING IT OUT OF ITS CAVE. OH, NO. OH, YES. YES. WITH THE ADMIRAL'S SUBMARINE IN THE FJORD, IT SHOULD BE A MOST ENLIGHTENING EXPERIMENT. YOU MUST BE COMPLETELY INSANE. YOU MURDERED ROLVAAG. YOU SMOTHERED HIM IN HIS SLEEP. SO... YOU TOLD HIM. YOU NEVER TRIED TO UNDERSTAND. NO MATTER. HAVE THEM FOLLOW ME DOWN BELOW... AND WATCH THEM. COME ON. MOVE. MOVE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH US? I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS. THEY'LL NEVER LET US OUT OF HERE. YOU MANIAC! [Gagging] [Gunshot] LARS! I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS, LARS. MOVE AWAY FROM THE LEVER. I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU. LARS! - STOP! STOP! - [Gunshots] [Groaning] [Growling] [Groaning, Screaming] [Grunting] [Sigrid Crying] THE GATE'S OPEN. THE MONSTER IS FREE. [Sobbing] I'VE GOT TO REACH THE SUB. THE SHORTWAVE, OVER THERE. CAPTAIN, THIS IS SONAR. WE'RE PICKING UP SOMETHING CLOSE... REAL CLOSE. [Growling] SEAVIEW! SEAVIEW! DO YOU READ ME, SEAVIEW? [Clicking Dials] DO YOU READ ME, SEAVIEW? THIS IS NELSON CALLING. NELSON CALLING! [Clicking] LOOK! SOUND GENERAL QUARTERS! [Klaxon Blaring] [Banging] [Man On Speaker] BATTLE STATIONS! BATTLE STATIONS! ALL BACK FULL! [On Speaker] ALL BACK FULL! [Klaxon Blaring] FULL ELEVATION ON BOW PLANES! FULL ELEVATION ON BOW PLANES! [Klaxon Blaring] OUR PLATES ARE STARTING TO BUCKLE! [Man On Speaker] CAPTAIN, WE CAN'T BREAK LOOSE! CAPTAIN, THE ADMIRAL'S TRYING TO CONTACT US BY SHORTWAVE. PIPE ME IN AND STAY WITH IT. THIS IS THE SEAVIEW. COME IN, ADMIRAL. COME IN. DO YOU READ ME, ADMIRAL? DO YOU READ ME? SHE'S GONNA CRACK UP ANY SECOND NOW, CAPTAIN. [Metal Cracking] SEAVIEW? DO YOU READ ME, SEAVIEW? SEAVIEW! SEAVIEW, DO YOU READ ME? THIS IS NELSON. DO YOU READ ME? [Crane] WE READ YOU, ADMIRAL. COME IN. LEE, HEAD FOR OPEN WATER. IT'S TOO LATE. WE'RE CAUGHT. WE CAN'T BREAK LOOSE. LISTEN TO ME. BRING YOUR REACTORS UP TO FULL POWER. SHOOT A CHARGE THROUGH THE HULL. THAT COULD BLOW US SKY HIGH. IT'S YOUR ONLY CHANCE. TRUST ME, LEE. IT'LL WORK. REACTORS UP FULL. [On Speaker] REACTORS UP FULL. - FULL EMERGENCY POWER! - FULL EMERGENCY POWER! FULL EMERGENCY POWER! [Electrical Crackling] - [Explosions] - [Electrical Crackling] CAPTAIN, WE'RE BREAKING LOOSE! WE'RE MOVING! [Weak Growl] [Crane] ADMIRAL, IT WORKED. THE MONSTER IS DEAD... STONE DEAD. SURFACE AND PUT A BOAT ASHORE TO PICK ME UP. [Clicks Dial] EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ON THAT END? IT WILL BE. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
