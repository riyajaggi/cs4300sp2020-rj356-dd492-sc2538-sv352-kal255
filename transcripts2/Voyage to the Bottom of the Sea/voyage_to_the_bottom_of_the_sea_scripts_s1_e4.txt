 DAVID HEDISON. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. PRESIDENT FUENTES HAS APPEALED TO THE UNITED STATES FOR HELP? THAT'S RIGHT. FOUR DAYS AGO, WE RECEIVED A CODED MESSAGE FROM A VESSEL AT SEA. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE U.N... I KNOW. HE'S BEEN CONSISTENT ABOUT ONLY ONE THING SINCE HE TOOK OVER... HIS HATRED OF US AND FRIENDSHIP FOR ANY OF OUR ENEMIES. OH, WE WERE SKEPTICAL TOO. THIS TIME YOU'RE CONVINCED THE APPEAL IS GENUINE? WE FEEL THAT THE POSSIBILITY MUST BE EXPLORED. WHAT DOES FUENTES PROPOSE? HE ASKS THAT WE RENDEZVOUS WITH HIS SHIP AND BRING HIM TO WASHINGTON. HIS DEFECTION AT A TIME LIKE THIS COULD BE POLITICAL DYNAMITE.

 EXACTLY. NOW, WE'VE FELT FOR SOME TIME... THAT FUENTES MAY ACTUALLY BE A PRISONER OF GENERAL D'ALVAREZ AND A GROUP OF ARMY OFFICERS. WELL, WHY DON'T THEY JUST DISPOSE OF HIM? BECAUSE HE'S STILL THE HERO OF THE REVOLUTION TO THE PEOPLE. HAS FUENTES' PROPOSAL BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE LEADERS OF THE GOVERNMENT IN EXILE? OH, YES, YES. ASK SENOR GALDOS TO COME IN. NOW, THIS IS THE KIND OF A MANEUVER THAT COULD EASILY BACKFIRE. EXACTLY. ABSOLUTE SECRECY IS ESSENTIAL. THAT'S WHY THE MISSION IS YOURS AND SEAVIEW'S, ADMIRAL. OH, WE'RE TO MAKE THE RENDEZVOUS AT SEA. IF THE APPEAL PROVES GENUINE, YOU WILL BRING PRESIDENT FUENTES BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. SHOULD THERE BE ANY COMPLICATION, YOUR STATUS IS, OF COURSE, UNOFFICIAL. MM. I UNDERSTAND. AH, SENOR GALDOS. COME IN, SENOR. I WANT YOU TO MEET A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. ADMIRAL HARRIMAN NELSON, THIS IS SENOR GALDOS. NICE TO MEET YOU, SIR. HOW DO YOU DO? I'VE BEEN BRINGING THE ADMIRAL UP TO DATE ON FUENTES, AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME DOUBT AS TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF PRESIDENT FUENTES' PROPOSAL. I ASSURE YOU, SIR, WE, TOO, HAVE OUR DOUBTS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE HOPE FOR OUR COUNTRY. ONE THING MORE, ADMIRAL. THE SENOR HAS ASKED PERMISSION TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE AT THE RENDEZVOUS. I KNOW ALEJANDRO FUENTES WELL. IF HE KEEPS HIS WORD, I WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO GIVE HIM THE WELCOME HE DESERVES. OKAY, SIR. [Crane On Intercom] ADMIRAL, WE'RE APPROACHING THE DESIGNATED RENDEZVOUS AT EXACTLY "H" HOUR, BUT SO FAR SONAR HASN'T PICKED UP THE YACHT. KEEP US POSTED, LEE. AYE, SIR. WE MAY HAVE HAD OUR TRIP FOR NOTHING. I'VE LEARNED NOT TO DEPEND ON ALEJANDRO. YOU ONCE FOUGHT FOR THE SAME THINGS. SO I THOUGHT, UNTIL WE WON. ALEJANDRO HATED TYRANNY ONLY AS LONG AS SOMEONE ELSE WAS THE TYRANT. NOW IT SEEMS HE'S HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. WE'LL SEE. [Crane On Intercom] ADMIRAL? YES? SONAR'S PICKED UP A SHIP, SIR. GOOD. TAKE 'ER UP, LEE. AYE, SIR. APPARENTLY FUENTES HAS KEPT THE RENDEZVOUS. I'M GLAD. THERE'S NO RESPONSE TO OUR SIGNALS, SIR. SHALL I TAKE A BOARDING PARTY AND INVESTIGATE? [Nelson] YES, BUT CAUTIOUSLY. SHE COULD BE BOOBY-TRAPPED. I'LL GO WITH YOU. GOOD. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THE LIFEBOATS ARE IN PLACE, AND THERE'S NO ONE ABOARD. SO ARE THE LIFE JACKETS, AND I FOUND NOTHING. LOOK. IT'S ALEJANDRO'S RING. WHEN HE'S NERVOUS, HE HAS A HABIT OF SLIPPING IT ON AND OFF. SO PRESIDENT FUENTES WAS ABOARD. OR WE ARE SUPPOSED TO THINK HE WAS. AND I FOUND THIS ON THE CHAIR OF THE WHEELHOUSE. I DON'T THINK THIS RING COULD BE A DELIBERATE PLANT. THEY COULDN'T BE CERTAIN ANY OF US WOULD RECOGNIZE IT AS FUENTES'. UNLESS THEY KNOW I AM WITH YOU. FOR THE MOMENT I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT PRESIDENT FUENTES... TRIED TO KEEP THE RENDEZVOUS AS PLANNED, WAS SEIZED AND TAKEN OFF THE YACHT. THAT MEANS ANOTHER SHIP IN THESE WATERS. ORDER RADAR SCANNING, LEE. RIGHT. UH, LEE. PUT A PRIZE CREW ABOARD THE YACHT AND SEND IT TO THE NEAREST PORT. NAVIGATION FROM HERE TO THE MAINLAND WILL BE TRICKY, ADMIRAL. SHOALING WATER, REEFS. [Nelson] WELL, LEE, YOU'VE SAILED THESE WATERS IN SMALL CRAFT. PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER COMMAND THE PRIZE CREW. AYE, SIR. AND MAINTAIN RADIO CONTACT WHILE WE SEARCH FOR THE OTHER SHIP. AYE, SIR. CAPTAIN CRANE, HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT FUNNY PATCH OF FOG? WE'RE MOVING RIGHT INTO IT. CAME UP OUT OF NOWHERE. EXCUSE ME, SIR. ADMIRAL WISHES TO SPEAK TO YOU. - RIGHT. CRANE HERE, SIR. - THE SONAR'S PICKED UP ANOTHER SHIP. SMALL, FAST, HEADED TOWARD YOU ON A COLLISION COURSE. HAVE YOU SIGHTED HER? NO, SIR. I JUST HAD A LOOK, BUT THERE'S NO CRAFT IN SIGHT. BUT SHE MAY BE HIDDEN IN A SMALL PATCH OF LOCAL FOG THAT WE'RE JUST ENTERING. SIR, IT'S RIGHT ALONGSIDE. SONAR REPORTS THE OTHER SHIP RIGHT ALONGSIDE. [Coughing] ADMIRAL, THE FOG, IT... [Coughing] LEE. COME IN, LEE. LEE. LEE, COME IN. LEE, COME IN. SEAVIEW TO LIBERTAD. SEAVIEW TO LIBERTAD. KEEP TRYING. YES, SIR. MR. MORTON, STAND BY TO CHANGE COURSE. AYE, AYE, SIR. [Man On Radio] SEAVIEW TO LIBERTAD. SEAVIEW TO LIBERTAD. REPORT FROM BARRACUDA, MI GENERAL. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. VERY GOOD. NOW, HOW ABOUT SEÑOR PRESIDENTE? RESTING QUIETLY. AND WILL BE FOR SEVERAL HOURS. APPARENTLY THE LETHION GAS IS AS EFFECTIVE AS YOU PREDICTED, COLONEL. THANKS TO YOUR COUNTRY'S GENEROSITY, WE HAVE THE WEAPON OF TOMORROW TODAY. HAS THE PRIZE CREW BEEN REMOVED FROM THE YACHT? YES, SIR. THEY'RE ALL ABOARD THE BARRACUDA. ARRANGE FOR A SUITABLE ESCORT TO MEET OUR PRISONERS AS SOON AS THEY DOCK. BRING THEM HERE IMMEDIATELY. YES, SIR. FORTUNATE YOU ANTICIPATED THIS FOOLISH MOVE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST EMBARRASSING. NOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO TURN IT TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. [Glasses Clink Together] THEY DELIBERATELY LEFT THE YACHT FOR US TO FIND. NATURALLY. THEY KNEW WE'D PUT A PRIZE CREW ABOARD, AND THEY WANTED TO TAKE IT. PROBABLY FOR PROPAGANDA. MAYBE ALEJANDRO WAS NEVER ANYTHING BUT BAIT IN THE TRAP. YOU'RE DEDICATED TO DISTRUSTING HIM, AREN'T YOU? I'VE REPORTED THE SITUATION TO WASHINGTON. THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR... THAT WE'LL GET NO SUPPORT IF THERE'S MORE TROUBLE. [Knocking] - YEAH. - WE JUST RECEIVED A CODED MESSAGE, ADMIRAL. AH, THE RESISTANCE FIGHTERS WILL MEET US TODAY AT 1800 IN BANYAN COVE. YOU KNOW THE PLACE? YES. THE BEACH IS FLAT, OPEN WITH NO COVER. IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO AVOID BEING SEEN BY THE PATROLS. WE'LL HAVE TO RISK IT. [Chattering] OH, WHAT A HEADACHE. OH, YEAH. LIKE THE WORLD'S WORST HANGOVER, AND I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A DRINK. WHAT WAS THAT FOG, SIR? SOME KIND OF NEW NERVE GAS, I GUESS. WHY DID THEY WANT TO SHANGHAI US? [Coughs] HEY. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. [Men Coughing] [Snaps Fingers] [Door Squeaks] GENTLEMEN, I AM GENERAL ESTEBAN D'ALVAREZ. WELL, WHY WERE WE KIDNAPPED? HEY! YOU ARE CAPTAIN LEE CRANE. YOUR WALLET. I ASKED A QUESTION. YOU'RE NOT KIDNAPPED. YOU WERE ARRESTED, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO KIDNAP OUR BELOVED PRESIDENTE, ALEJANDRO FUENTES. WHO'S GONNA BELIEVE THAT? ALL OF MY COUNTRYMEN. BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID NOT TO. BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO PUBLICLY ADMIT YOUR GUILT. I'LL ADMIT NOTHING, PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY. YOU MAY CHANGE YOUR MIND. ANOTHER ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. TO CELEBRATE THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LIBERATION, I PROMISED THAT EVERY HOUR ONE TRAITOR WILL DIE, FROM NOW UNTIL MIDNIGHT TOMORROW. NAMES ARE BEING DRAWN BY LOT FROM THE CONDEMNED MEN HERE. YOUR FOUR NAMES ARE ALREADY INCLUDED AND WILL REMAIN SO... UNTIL YOU ADVISE ME THAT YOU ARE READY TO MAKE THE PUBLIC CONFESSION OF YOUR GUILT. CAPTAIN. GENTLEMEN. ¡ATENCIÓN! CAPTAIN, YOU THINK HE MEANS IT? NO, HE'S JUST TRYING TO THROW A BLUFF INTO US. [Man Yells In Spanish] YEAH, YEAH, HE'S JUST BLUFFIN'. - [Man Yells In Spanish] - [Gunfire] [Snaps Fingers] WELL, ALEJANDRO, YOUR TRIP WAS SHORTER THAN YOU PLANNED. YOU UNDERESTIMATED ME, HUH? ESTEBAN, THEY ARE USING YOU. ALEJANDRO, YOU KNOW SOMETHING? YOU HAVE LIVED TOO LONG. IN THE EARLY DAYS, YOU SERVED A PURPOSE. NOW YOU'RE IN THE WAY. THEN WHY DID YOU BRING ME BACK, EH? YOUR DEFECTION COULD CAUSE TROUBLE. I HAVE TO PRESERVE YOUR IMAGE. THE GALLANT FIGHTER, HEROIC TO THE END, HUH? IF ONLY THOSE FOOLS HAD LET GALDOS SHOOT YOU. I WON'T BE USED BY YOU ANYMORE. - I WILL TELL THE PEOPLE THE TRUTH. - DOCTOR! NO, PLEASE. DON'T DRUG ME. HEY, YOU, COME HERE. HELP THE DOCTOR. [Struggling] OH, NO. PLEASE NO! A CODED MESSAGE THAT WAS INTERCEPTED... FROM THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT TO THE SEAVIEW. THEY MEAN TO ATTEMPT A LANDING IN BANYAN COVE AT 6:00. BE READY FOR THEM. YES, SIR. DOUBLE THE COASTAL PATROL. ALERT ALL SUBCHASERS AND TORPEDO BOATS. VERY GOOD, SIR. MARK. ALL STOP. WE'RE A THOUSAND YARDS OFF BANYAN COVE, SIR. WE'LL HOLD THIS POSITION TILL ZERO HOURS MINUS 30 MINUTES, THEN SURFACE TO ALLOW THE LANDING PARTY TO DISEMBARK. WHO ELSE WILL GO WITH YOU? JUST SEAMAN WILLIAMS. YOU COMMAND THE SEAVIEW, MR. MORTON. RIGHT, SIR. AFTER WE DISEMBARK, SUBMERGE AND RETURN TO A POSITION OUTSIDE THE THREE-MILE ZONE. WHEN WILL WE PICK YOU UP? GIVE US EXACTLY 48 HOURS. IF WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR YOU, PROCEED AT ONCE TO HOME BASE. EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT I JUST PICKED UP ANOTHER CODED MESSAGE. FROM THE RESISTANCE FORCES? THIS TIME THEY USED ANOTHER CODE. "LANDING PLANS KNOWN. CHANGE RENDEZVOUS TO BAY OF RED CLIFFS. TIME 1700." THAT'S ONE HOUR EARLIER. THIS MAY BE FROM D'ALVAREZ. NO. IF HE KNEW ABOUT THE ORIGINAL PLAN, WHY BOTHER TO CHANGE IT? HE'D SIMPLY WAIT FOR US AT BANYAN COVE. BUT THE RED CLIFFS ARE THE PLACE I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN. MR. MORTON, PROCEED TO THE BAY OF RED CLIFFS. RIGHT, SIR. WE HAVE A FRIEND CLOSE TO D'ALVAREZ. [Air Hissing] [Grunting] [Gasps] RICARDO. RICARDO. RICARDO. IT CAN'T BE. I SAW THEM KILL YOU. I WAS SO SURE. THEY WERE JUST AS SURE, BUT NOW I'M BACK, AND I'M GOING TO FINISH WHAT I STARTED. NO! YOU ARE WRONG. THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WHY WAIT HERE, DETTA? THERE WILL BE ROADBLOCKS. I KNOW, BUT THE LONGER WE WAIT, THE LESS CHANCE OF GETTING THROUGH THEM. WE'VE GOT LESS THAN TWO DAYS. [Door Opens] [Detta] IT'S ALL RIGHT. [Indistinct Whispering] YEAH. THEY HAVE TAKEN YOUR MEN TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. ARE THEY ALL RIGHT? THEY HAVE NOT HARMED THEM AS YET. WHEN CAN WE GET THEM? I THINK I KNOW A WAY PAST THE ROADBLOCK. WE MUST WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT. TOMORROW NIGHT? YES. REMEMBER, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET INTO THE CITY. WE MUST GET INSIDE THE PALACE. CAN YOU HELP US DO THAT? I THINK SO, IF YOU TRUST ME. I TRUST YOU. WILLIAMS, MIGHT AS WELL GET SOME REST IF WE CAN. IF WE CAN. WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT? I THOUGHT YOU HAD DIED. DID YOU CARE, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER? WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO ASK? IS THERE NOTHING IN YOU BUT HATRED FOR ALEJANDRO? RICARDO, YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT HIM. BUT FOR YOU, I WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM, RIGHT THERE ON THE PIER. PLEASE, LISTEN. HE HAS NOT CHANGED, I KNOW. HE'S ONLY PRETENDED TO SIDE WITH D'ALVAREZ, SO HE COULD CONTINUE HAVING SOME CONTROL OVER HIM. HE HATES WHAT D'ALVAREZ STANDS FOR, HAS DONE, IS DOING. HE SHOULD HAVE SIDED WITH ME, FOUGHT D'ALVAREZ WHEN I WANTED TO. YOU BOTH WOULD HAVE ENDED UP AGAINST A WALL. DIFFERENT MEN HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF FIGHTING. MY WAY OF FIGHTING WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ALEJANDRO, UNTIL AFTER HE WON. DO THEY KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT? DO YOU? WE WERE MEANT TO GET THAT MESSAGE ABOUT THE BANYAN COVE LANDING. WE WERE DECOYED AWAY FROM THE REAL LANDING AT RED CLIFFS. SO IT SEEMS, SIR. I WANT ROADBLOCKS ON EVERY HIGHWAY. I WANT EVERY VEHICLE STOPPED AND SEARCHED. I WANT EVERY PERSON THOROUGHLY QUESTIONED. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY ARE IN THE LANDING PARTY, SIR? MAYBE ONE, MAYBE A DOZEN. ONE THING IS CERTAIN, CAPTAIN: TO GET WHAT THEY WANT, THEY HAVE TO COME TO US, HUH? THE TRAP IS BAITED, SO WE WAIT. A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT. THE SUBMARINE MUST BE NEARBY WAITING TO PICK THEM UP AGAIN, HUH? OUR FRIENDS CAME INTO OUR COUNTRY UNINVITED. PERHAPS WE CAN SEE TO IT THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO LEAVE, HMM? YES, SIR. HMM. [Clattering] CAPTAIN. YEAH? WHAT TIME IS IT? ALMOST 7:00. IF THEY WERE COMING AFTER US, THEY'D BE HERE BY NOW. THAT'S RIGHT. [Footsteps] HEY, CAPTAIN, IF YOU SAY WHAT THAT GUY WANTS, WOULD IT REALLY BE SO BAD? I MEAN, LOOK. WHO'D BELIEVE IT? LOTS OF PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY. ONLY THOSE WHO WANNA THINK THE WORST ABOUT AMERICANS ANYWAY. IT'S THE PEOPLE ON THE FENCE HE WANTS TO INFLUENCE. YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. KOWALSKI? THE ADMIRAL'S DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO FIND US, TO HELP US. YOU KNOW THAT. OH, SURE. BUT WHAT CAN HE DO AGAINST A WHOLE COUNTRY? [Man] ¡ATENCIÓN! - ¡APUNTEN! ¡FUEGO! - [Gunfire] TIME'S RUNNING OUT, CAPTAIN. [Bag Pops] I HATE THIS WAITING. I'D RATHER DO ANYTHING BUT WAIT. THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I NEVER GOT MARRIED. MR. MORTON. I JUST PICKED UP THIS CODED MESSAGE. SAME AS THE FIRST ONE YESTERDAY. "SEAVIEW, MISSION COMPLETED. RENDEZVOUS SAME PLACE NOON TOMORROW." NOON? THE ADMIRAL SAID 1800. THINGS MUST HAVE WENT SMOOTHER THAN HE THOUGHT THEY WOULD. IT'S NOT LIKE THE ADMIRAL TO MAKE A CHANGE LIKE THIS MIDWAY. BUT IF THE GUYS ARE OUT THERE, THE QUICKER WE GET 'EM OUT, THE BETTER. IF THERE WERE SOME WAY TO CONFIRM THIS. BUT THERE AIN'T. AND IF THE ADMIRAL AND THE GUYS ARE THERE AND WAITING AT NOON, AND WE DON'T SHOW UP? YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE'S NO CHOICE. WHAT IS IT? D'ALVAREZ CALLS IT... THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. IT'S WHERE THEY MAKE LETHION. LETHION? THE NERVE GAS WHICH PARALYZES IN SECONDS. AH, YES, THE FOG THAT LEE DESCRIBED. OUR FRIEND AND ALLY BUILT THIS PLANT. MOST OF THE TECHNICIANS ARE FOREIGNERS. DETTA, WE DON'T WANT A GUIDED TOUR. HOW DO WE GET TO THE CAPITAL? TRUCKS WHICH HAUL THE GAS HAVE TOP PRIORITY. THEY'LL LET THEM PASS THE ROADBLOCKS. QUICKLY, GET THEIR UNIFORMS. [Murmuring] THE RENDEZVOUS WAS SET FOR NOON. I WANT THE ENTIRE BAY OF THE RED CLIFFS SATURATED WITH DEPTH CHARGES AT THAT TIME. YES, CORRECT. EL PRESIDENTE. ALEJANDRO. THE PEOPLE CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION. THEY'RE IMPATIENT. JUST LISTEN. SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN OUT THERE SINCE DAWN, WAITING TO GET EVEN A GLIMPSE OF THEIR HERO. CAN'T... GO... OUT. OF COURSE YOU CAN. BECAUSE WE'LL GO ARM IN ARM. I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOU, AS I ALWAYS HAVE. NO, PLEASE. NO! TODAY, JUST AN APPEARANCE TO SILENCE ANY VICIOUS RUMORS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN CIRCULATED. NO SPEECH. JUST LET THE PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU FOR A FEW MOMENTS. LET THEM CHEER YOU. LET THEM BE REASSURED. [Crowd Murmuring] RAISE YOUR ARM. RAISE IT! [Crowd Cheers] HIGHER. [Cell Door Lock Clicks, Door Opens] WELL, CAPTAIN CRANE, YOU'RE STILL UNWILLING TO CONFORM? VERY WELL. WHICH ONE OF YOU IS, UH, FARRELL. HEY, FARRELL, YOUR NAME HAS BEEN CHOSEN. COME ON, FARRELL, QUICKLY. [Snaps Fingers] CAPTAIN! CAPTAIN CRANE? FARRELL? KOWALSKI! CAPTAIN CRANE! LET ME GO, YOU... CAPTAIN CRANE! [Yells] [Man Yelling] GET OFF! GET INSIDE! BOTH OF YOU! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR? YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE WITH YOUR CONCERN. I'M VERY SORRY, SIR. MY ATTENTION WAS DISTRACTED. THAT'S OF NO IMPORTANCE. THE BLINDNESS IS TEMPORARY, CAPTAIN. IT WILL PASS. CAPTAIN CRANE! KOWALSKI! CAPTAIN CRANE! FARRELL! YOU FILTHY BUTCHERS! THERE'S STILL TIME TO SAVE HIM, CAPTAIN. SAY THE WORD, I WILL STEP TO THE WINDOW. [Man] ¡APUNTEN! ¡FUEGO! [Gunfire] I DO NOT KNOW WHICH OF YOUR CREW WILL BE NEXT, CAPTAIN CRANE, BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE ALL OF THEM DIE. GET IN THERE! WE'RE APPROACHING RED CLIFFS, SIR. STAND BY TO SURFACE. MR. MORTON, THAT MESSAGE ABOUT THE NOON RENDEZVOUS WAS A PHONY. THIS WARNING JUST CAME THROUGH. IT'S A TRAP. [Explosions] RIG FOR DEPTH CHARGES! [Explosions] BATTLE STATIONS! BATTLE STATIONS! [Man] NO SHIP CONTACT. THEY MUST BE PLANES. TAKE 'ER DOWN, VERTICAL DIVE. I-I AM SORRY. THEY HAVE KILLED ONE OF YOUR MEN. DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE? A MAN CALLED FARRELL. [Scoffs] WHY? WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY HOPE TO GAIN BY IT? THEY ALSO DEMAND A PUBLIC CONFESSION FROM YOUR CAPTAIN CRANE. THEY WILL KILL HIM TOO. WE HAVE THE TRUCK, THE GAS. WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. YET WE HIDE IN THIS PLACE. WHY? WE HAVE A GOOD FRIEND IN THE PALACE. HE SAYS IT WILL BE EASIER DURING THE SIESTA. DETTA, IF WE WAIT ANY LONGER, THEY MAY KILL THE OTHERS. WE HAVE TO BE AT THE BAY OF RED CLIFFS BEFORE 6:00 TONIGHT. IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED, WE MUSTN'T GO BEFORE 3:00. I KNOW THERE WILL BE TIME. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF WAITING! NO, RICARDO. IF WE GO NOW, WE FAIL. WE DIE. I SAY WE GO. PATIENCE. THREE MORE HOURS WON'T COOL YOUR HATRED. AND WHAT DO YOU SAY? - WE WAIT. - WHAT ABOUT YOUR MEN? THROWING AWAY OUR LIVES WON'T HELP THEM ANY. ADMIRAL, WHY ARE YOU HERE? - NOT TO BE A MARTYR. - I'M A PATRIOT! AND A FOOL. [Explosion] WE JUST HAVE TO LIE HERE AND LET THEM POUND US TO PIECES. WE'VE HAD A LONG JOURNEY TOGETHER. PERHAPS NOW IT IS NEARLY OVER. YOU STILL DREAM OF BRIGHT, NEW TOMORROWS, DETTA. THEY NEVER COME. I STILL DREAM. YES, RICARDO. I-I STILL DREAM FOR US. I NO LONGER BELIEVE IN SUCH VISIONS. THIS IS AN END, NOT A BEGINNING. LET'S START. ALL RIGHT. YES, COLONEL. YES. I-I'LL CHECK INTO IT AT ONCE. I WILL EXPECT YOU. HEY, SERRA. YES, SIR. COME HERE. I'VE JUST BEEN ADVISED THAT A TRUCK... CARRYING A SHIPMENT OF LETHION FROM THE INSTITUTE... HAS BEEN MISSING SINCE EARLY MORNING. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT OUR LANDING PARTY HAS COMMANDEERED IT. ISSUE AN IMMEDIATE ALERT. AT ONCE, SIR. CHIEF. HOW ARE THE REPAIRS GOING? SLOW. THEY DID A LOT OF DAMAGE. THEY'D HAVE DONE A LOT MORE IF WE HADN'T FIRED THAT PHONY DEBRIS THROUGH THE TUBES. HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE? TWO, THREE HOURS AT LEAST. IT'S ALMOST 1500. IN THREE HOURS, WE HAVE TO BE WAITING FOR THE ADMIRAL. AYE, AYE, SIR. THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT. EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN. WHICH ONE OF YOU IS, UM... [Chuckles] UH... PATTERSON. STILL NO STATEMENT, CAPTAIN? AS YOU WISH. [Snaps Fingers] [Lock Clicks Open] [Cell Door Closes] [Men Coughing] - [Yelling In Spanish] - [Gunshots] [Men Coughing] [Man Yelling In Spanish] CRANE, WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU, CRANE? ADMIRAL, OVER HERE! PUT THESE ON QUICKLY. ALL RIGHT. WHERE'S RICARDO? GONE TO GET THE PRESIDENT. HE'S GONE TO KILL HIM. HURRY. THE GAS IS PARALYZING. THE MISSING TRUCK PASSED THE ROADBLOCK BEFORE NOON. THEY'RE HERE IN THE CAPITAL. [Coughing] LETHION. THEY'RE IN THE PALACE. SOUND THE ALARM. I'LL SEE TO THE PRESIDENTE. [Breathing Heavily] [Breathing Faster] HUH? RICARDO? A DREAM? NO, NO DREAM. C-COME TO KILL ME? I TOLD YOU I WOULD. JUST AS WELL. JUST AS WELL. JUST AS WELL. WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT? ARE YOU TOO DRUNK TO REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING? DRUGGED. DRUGGED. D'ALVAREZ DRUG... HEY! [Ring Squirts] STEBAN! NELSON. I CAN'T SEE, MY EYES. CAPTAIN, WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE. QUICKLY. [Groans] THIS IS CAPTAIN SERRA. INFORM THE PATROL AT RED CLIFFS TO RETURN TO THEIR BARRACKS. YES. YES, THE ALERT HAS BEEN CANCELED. NOW SWITCH ME TO THE COMMANDER OF THE COURTYARD GUARDS. [Explosion] [Serra Coughing] [Alarm Wailing] KOWALSKI, START THE TRUCK. THE ALARM. IN A MOMENT, THIS PLACE WILL BE SWARMING WITH SOLDIERS. - COME ON. - [Gunshot] - IT'S EMPTY. - [Gunshot] [Truck Engine Cranking] WHAT'S WRONG? IT WON'T START. TURN IT OVER. I'LL TRY AND GET THE GAS. THERE'S A MACHINE GUN AT THE GATE. - I'LL HOLD THEM OFF UNTIL YOU GET AWAY. - RICARDO, YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH. I HAVE DONE NOTHING UNLESS YOU ARE SAFE. YOU HAVE WORK TO DO OUTSIDE. MY PLACE IS HERE UNTIL YOU RETURN. RICARDO, WAIT FOR ME. I WANT TO GO WITH YOU. - ARE YOU SURE? - YES. [Gunshots] - [Machine Gun Fire] - KOWALSKI, GO! [Gunfire Continues] [Machine Gun Firing] THE FIRING STOPPED. BUT NOT FOR LONG. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
