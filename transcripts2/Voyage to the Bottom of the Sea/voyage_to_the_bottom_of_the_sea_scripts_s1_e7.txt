 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964â€“1968): Season 1, Episode 7 - Turn Back the Clock - full transcript 
 Nine months ago a diving bell was lost with four men aboard during an Antarctic expedition. One man, Jason Kemp, is found alive. He is suffering from amnesia and can't remember anything after the dive. Nelson thinks he may be suffering from shock as he rambles on about a tropical land filled with monsters. Kemp and Carol Denning, an underwater photographer and the daughter of one of the missing men, joins the Seaview and returns to the place where the bell was lost. Their bell suffers the same fate and Nelson, Crane, Kemp and Carol Denning somehow find themselves washed up on a tropical beach in the frozen Antarctic.

 THE ADMIRAL'S GONNA FLY YOU TO WASHINGTON. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES TO CHANGE AND THROW SOMETHING IN A BAG, AND I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. I WISH I KNEW THE ANSWER, BUT I DON'T. [Exhales] I DON'T. YOU LOOK MARVELOUS. STILL MY GIRL? [Sighs] I'M SORRY, ADMIRAL NELSON, BUT IT ISN'T EVERY DAY A MAN RETURNS FROM THE GRAVE. OF COURSE, JASON. WE HATE TO PRESS YOU, BUT IF YOU COULD REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. JASON, IF DAD WAS KILLED, YOU MUST TELL ME. I CAN STAND ANYTHING BUT NOT KNOWING. I DON'T KNOW! I KEEP TRYING, BUT NOTHING COMES! UH, EASY, KEMP. YOU'RE NOT TO EXCITE YOURSELF. I'M OKAY, DOCTOR. CAROL, YOU WERE ON THE ICEBREAKER WHEN THE DIVING BELL WENT DOWN. PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL JASON WHAT YOU SAW. IT MIGHT HELP. I WAS ON DECK THAT MORNING. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MUCH? I WAS THE LAST ONE TO CLIMB INTO THE BELL. YOU KISSED ME, WISHED ME LUCK. THERE WERE FOUR OF YOU IN THE BELL. YOU AND DAD FROM THE DENNING INSTITUTE AND... AND THE OTHER TWO MEN FROM THE NELSON INSTITUTE. BOB HERROD AND BILL YOUNGER. I REMEMBER ALL THAT. GO ON, CAROL. WELL, I... I WATCHED THE BELL AS IT WENT DOWN INTO THE WATER. EVEN AFTER IT DISAPPEARED, I... I KEPT STARING DOWN. WHEN... THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED. THE... THE CABLE BROKE. WE SEARCHED FOR DAYS! BUT THE ICE CLOSED IN. [Shudders] THERE WAS JUST NOTHING! NOTHING! I CAN'T REMEMBER. WE WENT DOWN IN THE BELL. AFTER THAT... WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME? WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER? YOU WILL IN TIME. TEMPORARY AMNESIA... IT OFTEN FOLLOWS A DEEP TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. AS TO WHAT THE EXPERIENCE WAS, EVEN THE TAPE GAVE US NO CLUE. TAPE? ON THE PLANE THAT BROUGHT HIM HERE TO WASHINGTON, HE SPOKE INTO A TAPE RECORDER. - WHAT ABOUT? - OH, SOMETHING ABOUT A TROPICAL OASIS... AND SEEING MONSTERS. OBVIOUSLY, A DELUSION INDUCED BY THE SHOCK. HOW ABOUT THAT, HONEY? A TROPICAL OASIS IN THE MIDDLE OF ANTARCTICA. - YOU HAVE THAT TAPE HANDY? - IT'S IN MY OFFICE. I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT. DO YOU MIND, JASON? MIND? GO AHEAD, HAVE A LAUGH ON ME. [Door Closes] JASON, YOU CAN TELL ME. - I WON'T LAUGH. - I DON'T KNOW! I'M SORRY, HONEY. SOMEDAY, I'LL REMEMBER EVERYTHING. I PROMISE. EVERYTHING. [Jason's Voice] HOT... HOT, THIS STINKIN' JUNGLE. RUN FIVE YARDS, AND YOU SWEAT LIKE A... WHAT'S THAT? DO YOU HEAR IT? DO YOU HEAR IT? IT'S COMING CLOSER. QUIET. QUIET. DON'T MOVE. THERE. THERE. LOOK. WHAT IS IT? A MONSTER! OH! OH, GET BACK! GET BACK! GET BACK! NO! NO! PURE NIGHTMARE. I WONDER. WELL, THE MAN IS OBVIOUSLY DELIRIOUS. THESE AREN'T THE FACTS, ADMIRAL. TELL ME, DOCTOR. HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT A MAN TO SURVIVE IN THE ANTARCTIC, UH, A MAN DRESSED AS LIGHTLY AS JASON KEMP WAS WHEN HE WAS PICKED UP? WHY, IT'S HARD TO SAY. NOT MORE THAN A DAY, CERTAINLY. BUT KEMP HAD BEEN THERE FOR NINE LONG MONTHS. HE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF UNDUE EXPOSURE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE LOOKS LIKE A MAN WHO'S SPENT A LONG TIME IN A TROPICAL CLIMATE. IMPOSSIBLE. AS A MAN OF SCIENCE... YOU MUST KNOW THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A TROPICAL REGION IN THE ANTARCTIC. AS A MAN OF SCIENCE, DOCTOR, YOU SHOULD BE AS CAREFUL AS I AM ABOUT USING THE WORD "IMPOSSIBLE." WELL, FACTS ARE FACTS. I'LL GIVE YOU A FACT. AT A CERTAIN POINT ON ANTARCTICA, THERE'S NO ICE. THE GROUND TEMPERATURE'S 50 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. I COULD CITE OTHER FACTS... THE HOT SPRINGS IN ICELAND, FOR EXAMPLE. NO, NO, DOCTOR. THE EXISTENCE OF A POCKET OF TROPICAL TERRAIN IN ANTARCTICA IS FAR FROM IMPOSSIBLE. THERE IS ONE THING THAT BAFFLES ME. WHAT'S THIS? IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS FOUND ON KEMP WHEN HE WAS PICKED UP. IT'S SOME ANIMAL TISSUE OF SOME SORT. OUR STAFF PATHOLOGIST MADE A CHECK ON IT, AND HE COULDN'T POSITIVELY IDENTIFY IT. MAY I USE YOUR PHONE? WHY, CERTAINLY. [Rotary Dial Whirs] OPERATOR, THIS IS ADMIRAL NELSON. GET ME THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY. - I WANT TO TALK TO DR. ERNST ZEIGLER. - ZEIGLER, THE ZOOLOGIST? [Line Ringing] BUT HIS FIELD'S PALEONTOLOGY, THE STUDY OF PREHISTORIC CREATURES. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE... IS A SECTION OF THE ESOPHAGUS OF... THAT LITTLE FELLOW, EDAPHOSAURUS. DINOSAUR. FROM THE MESOZOIC ERA, PROBABLY THE JURASSIC PERIOD. ONE OF THE POLAR REGIONS, YOU SAY? THE ANTARCTIC. THE WORLD IS FULL OF WONDERS. WE'VE ALREADY FOUND MASTODONS FROZEN IN THE ICE FOR A MILLION YEARS. BUT THIS, WHY, IT MUST BE 150 MILLION YEARS OLD. ERNST, WILL YOU TEST THIS ON YOUR ATOMIC CLOCK? I'D LIKE TO SEE EXACTLY HOW OLD THIS CREATURE REALLY IS. CERTAINLY. OH, WILLIAM, PUT THIS IN THE CLOCK, PLEASE. RIGHT AWAY, SIR. [Machine Buzzes] [Bangs Table] I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. YOU'VE TRICKED ME. - TRICKED YOU? - MY FRIEND, CREATURES LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN EXTINCT... FOR AGES... EONS! THIS ONE... NO. ONE YEAR AGO, HARRIMAN... ONE YEAR AGO, IT WAS ALIVE. [Tires Screeching] TAKE YOU BACK? IT COULD BE THE SAME ONE. I'M SORRY. IT STILL HASN'T COME BACK. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET ABOARD. WELCOME ABOARD, CAROL. THANKS. - ALL SET? - READY TO GO, SIR. JASON, HOW DID YOU ESCAPE FROM THE HOSPITAL? ONCE HE FOUND YOU WOULDN'T POSTPONE THE EXPEDITION, HE REFUSED TO STAY SICK. BLAME ME? LEE, DO WE HAVE SUITABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MISS DENNING? UH, YES, SIR. I'M TURNING MY CABIN OVER TO HER. MALONE, ESCORT MISS DENNING TO MY CABIN. AYE, AYE, SIR. THIS WAY, MISS. UH, MY THANKS TOO, CRANE, FOR TAKING CARE OF MY GIRL ALL THE TIME I WAS MISSING. SEE YOU LATER. GET UNDER WAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'LL BE IN MY QUARTERS. AYE, SIR. OH, BROTHER. "THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF MY GIRL." WHERE'D HE GET THAT "MY GIRL"? MR. MORTON. SINGLE UP FORE AND AFT AND PREPARE TO GET UNDER WAY. WHAT'D I SAY? [Crewman] CAPTAIN, WOULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN GETTING THIS READING? JUST A FEW SECONDS, SIR. CHIP, WHAT'S OUR EXACT POSITION? HERE. ONLY IT DOESN'T CHECK OUT. THERE SHOULD BE NO UNDERWATER PEAKS AT ALL IN THIS AREA. OBSTRUCTION DEAD AHEAD. ALL BACK FULL. HARD RIGHT RUDDER. [Man On Speaker] ALL BACK FULL. HARD RIGHT RUDDER. [Loud Crash] ALL STOP. [On Speaker] ALL STOP. [On Speaker] ALL STOP. DAMAGE TO PORT SECTION 3, SIR. PORT SECTION 3, DAMAGE REPORT. [On Speaker] PORT 3, LEAK IN BALLAST INTAKE LINE, CAPTAIN. WE'RE SHIPPING WATER. DAMAGE CONTROL PARTY TO PORT SECTION 3. DAMAGE CONTROL, AYE. [Man On Speaker] PORT 3, ALL LEAKS SECURED. VERY GOOD. STAND BY. MAINTAIN YOUR TRIM AT DEAD STOP. AYE, AYE, SIR. MAINTAIN YOUR TRIM AT DEAD STOP. [Exhales] WE WERE LUCKY. WE'LL NEED A PAINT JOB ON THE PORT SIDE, BUT THAT'S ALL. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? ADMIRAL, THERE WAS A TWO-DEGREE ERROR IN THE N6-A. - N6-A? - IT'S OUR INERTIAL NAVIGATOR. IF IT'S MALFUNCTIONING, WE CAN'T CONTINUE. WITH YOUR PERMISSION, ADMIRAL, I'LL PUT BACK TO THE FALKLANDS FOR REPAIRS. WE CAN'T RISK ANY DELAYS. YOU MAY BE THROWING AWAY THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE OF FINDING MY FATHER. CAROL, I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SUBMARINE. I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 125 PEOPLE ON BOARD. I CAN'T AFFORD ANY UNNECESSARY RISKS. JASON, TELL HIM. YOU KNOW HOW VITAL TIME IS. - WELL, UH, HONEY, FOR ONCE I'M ON CRANE'S SIDE. - BUT... NOW, BE REASONABLE. WHEREVER I WAS, WHATEVER I WAS DOING, I DID MANAGE TO STAY ALIVE FOR NINE MONTHS. IF YOUR FATHER'S STILL ALL RIGHT, HE'LL BE JUST AS ALL RIGHT A WEEK FROM NOW. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT? I HELPED DEVELOP THE N6-A. GIVE ME AN HOUR OR TWO, MAYBE I CAN LOCATE THE TROUBLE AND WE CAN PROCEED. ALL RIGHT, CHIEF. WANNA TAKE A BREAK? HMM? OH. THANKS, LEE. - WE CAN GET UNDER WAY, CAPTAIN. - THE FALKLANDS? NO. IT'S BEEN CORRECTED. ANTARCTICA'S OUR NEXT STOP. AYE, SIR. THIS IS IT, SIR. THE PRECISE POINT MENTIONED IN THE LOG. WHAT IS THE WATER TEMPERATURE? IT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. FIFTY-NINE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. AND BELOW? AT A HUNDRED FATHOMS, IT WARMS UP TO NEARLY 70. ONLY ONE OTHER CASE ON RECORD LIKE IT IN POLAR WATERS. THAT WAS OUR EXPEDITION. THOSE WERE THE EXACT READINGS WE HAD WHEN WE WERE HERE. - I THOUGHT YOU'D LOST YOUR MEMORY. - AFTER THE DIVE. UP TO THAT POINT, I REMEMBER EVERYTHING. SLOW TO ONE-THIRD. [Man On Speaker] SLOW TO ONE-THIRD. ALL STOP. ALL STOP. MISSILE ROOM? MISSILE ROOM, JONES. CHIEF, HAVE THE DIVING BELL RIGGED. RIGHT, SKIPPER. AND STAND BY. RIGHT, SKIPPER. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, SIR. ADMIRAL. DO WE HAVE TO USE THE BELL? WHY CAN'T WE DIVE THE SUB? WE DON'T KNOW HOW DEEP WE'LL HAVE TO GO. AND EVEN SEAVIEW CAN'T TAKE PRESSURE MUCH BELOW 4,000 FEET. THE BELL CAN. - ALL SHIPSHAPE, ADMIRAL. - VERY WELL. LEE, YOU HANDLE COMMUNICATIONS WITH SEAVIEW. CAROL. I WANT PICTURES EVERY 50 FEET THROUGHOUT OUR DESCENT. RIGHT. JASON? READY. WELL THEN, LET'S GET STARTED. DEPTH 3,200. DEPTH 3,300. - EVERYTHING OKAY, SKIPPER? - SO FAR, SO GOOD, CURLEY. DEPTH 3,500. LEE, ANY SIGN OF A TIDAL SURGE? NONE. NO CURRENT INDICATED AT ALL. ANYTHING COME BACK TO YOU, JASON? IT HAPPENED JUST LIKE THIS. GOING DOWN... BOB HERROD WAS CALLING OUT THE DEPTH READINGS. WHAT WAS THE LAST FIGURE YOU REMEMBER? I DON'T KNOW! FOUR... 4,000 FEET! THEN... [Whimpering] PAY OUT TO 4,000 FEET. FOUR THOUSAND FEET, SIR. AYE, AYE. FOUR THOUSAND FEET. STILL NO CURRENT? NO TIDAL SURGE? NONE. HMM. NO! PULL US UP QUICK! PULL US UP! PULL US UP! HAUL US IN, CHIEF! YES, SIR. [Current Whirring] [Current Crashing] - [Carol Cries Out] - HELLO! SKIPPER! HELLO! CAN YOU READ ME? [Hammer Clicks] WILL IT WORK? MAYBE NOT AS GOOD AS NEW, BUT IT'LL WORK. CAROL ALL RIGHT? NOT AS GOOD AS NEW, EITHER, BUT I'LL WORK. WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE? THIS AREA'S PROBABLY HEATED BY CONSTANT VOLCANIC ACTIVITY. I'D SAY THAT THE BELL WAS SWEPT INTO A THERMAL CURRENT... CAUSED BY HEATED WATER POURING INTO THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN. - COULD THE SAME THING HAVE HAPPENED TO DAD? - PROBABLY DID. IF ONLY JASON COULD REMEMBER. PERHAPS HE WILL. THIS PLACE IS JUST INCREDIBLE. YES, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT... THE TREES, THE GIANT FERNS... ALL THE FLORA. BEFORE THIS, I'VE SEEN THEM ONLY AS FOSSILS, BUT HERE... HERE THEY'RE ALIVE. THEY COULD BE SOMETHING OUT THE MESOZOIC ERA. WE'LL HAVE TO FIND DRINKING WATER SOMEWHERE ELSE. THIS POOL IS SALTWATER. ANYTHING FAMILIAR TO YOU? I'M SORRY. [Birds Squawking] IT'S SO PEACEFUL HERE AND... AND WARM. DAD MUST BE ALIVE. I JUST FEEL IT. JASON! REMARKABLE. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY LEAVE A HUGE PRINT LIKE THAT? AN EDAPHOSAURUS. THAT SECTION OF ESOPHAGUS YOU HAD CAME FROM THE SAME SPECIE. THERE MUST BE OTHER TRACKS. LOOK AROUND. GO THAT WAY. WE'LL CIRCLE THE WATER HOLE. THERE'S ANOTHER PRINT. THIS IS THE WEIRDEST VEGETATION. OH, LOOK AT THOSE PLANTS. DON'T GO TOO FAR. [Creatures Twittering] [Loud Growl] [No Audible Dialogue] [Growling] LEE. [Growling Continues] LEE! [Growling Continues] LEE. LEE! [Snarling Growl] COME ON! [Bellowing] [Gunshot] [Roaring] [Roaring Continues] [Hissing] [Bellowing Growl] - [Roaring] - [Screams] [Gunshot] [Shrieks] [Growling] [Roaring] [Screams] [Creatures Growling] [Whimpering] - [Snarling Growls] - [Screams] [Screams] - [Screams] - [Howling] [Howling] [Howling Continues] [Whimpering] [Bodies Thudding] [Whimpers] [Nelson] LEE. [Jason] CAROL! CAROL, YOU ALL RIGHT? I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW. IT'S ANOTHER WORLD. WE FOUND SOMETHING. LOOKS LIKE AN OLD CAMPSITE. COME ON. I'M ALL RIGHT. [Jungle Creatures Twittering] I SAW SOMETHING. NOW, LET IT GO, LEE. WE'VE GOT TO STAY TOGETHER. - WHATEVER IT WAS, IT LOOKED HUMAN. - ALL RIGHT. BUT BE CAREFUL. AND DON'T GO TOO FAR. THE CLEARING'S ABOUT 200 YARDS UP THIS TRAIL. - WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU THERE. - RIGHT. WAIT! [Gasps] [Rattling] [Screaming] [Gasps] [Grunts] NICE COMPANY YOU KEEP. NOW LET'S MEET SOME OF MY FRIENDS. [Grunts] COME ON! [Whimpers] [Rustling] WHERE'D YOU FIND HER? - SHE'S SCARED HALF TO DEATH. - AMERIND, I'D SAY. NOTICE THE HIGH CHEEKBONES, THE CHARACTERISTIC EYE FOLDS. SOUTH AMERICA IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY. THERE MAY BE A COLONY OF THEM. ONE OF THEIR PRIMITIVE CANOES MIGHT HAVE BEEN SWEPT HERE CENTURIES AGO BY A STORM. [Carol] DENNING? DR. DENNING. DA-HA! [Gunshot] [Natives Chanting] [Yells] THAT SACRIFICIAL ALTAR OUT THERE, IS THAT FOR US? CEREMONY TO THE FIRE GOD... AT HIGH NOON ON THE LONGEST DAY OF THE YEAR. THAT'S TODAY, LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR. LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR WE'RE ALL DEAD. YOU KEPT TRYING TO DELAY US, FIRST IN WASHINGTON. THEN THERE WAS THE ACCIDENT TO THE INERTIAL NAVIGATOR. YOU KNEW THEN, DIDN'T YOU? SOMEBODY TAMPERED WITH THE GYRO. I KNEW THAT MUCH, AND I KNEW IT WASN'T ONE OF MY MEN. YOU COULD'VE KILLED US ALL! KEPT TRYING TO THINK, "WHY WOULD A DELAY BE WORTH ALL THAT TO YOU?" YOU WANTED MY FATHER DEAD. WHY, JASON? WHY? I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE DEAD. I SWEAR TO YOU, NOT ANYONE! I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND NOW, PART OF IT, AT LEAST. WHEN YOU LEFT HERE, DENNING WAS ALIVE. YOU KNEW IF YOU DIDN'T COME BACK UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY, HE'D BE DEAD. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF, JASON? WHAT CAN DENNING TELL US ABOUT YOU? DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. HOW CAN ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD'VE DONE IN MY PLACE? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE. BUT I KNOW, JASON. DAD! OH, DAD! ADMIRAL. SO YOU DID GET AWAY, JASON. I WONDERED ABOUT THAT. HERROD AND YOUNGER WEREN'T SO LUCKY, WERE THEY? ARE THEY DEAD? WILL YOU TELL THEM OR SHALL I? THERE WAS A GIRL WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM. HE USED HER TO ESCAPE. BUT HERROD AND YOUNGER... TELL THEM! I DIDN'T KNOW THEY'D BE KILLED! HE KNEW. HE USED THEM. HE DELIBERATELY LED HERROD AND YOUNGER INTO A TRAP. WHILE THEY DIED, HE SLIPPED AWAY. NO WONDER YOU WANTED TO STALL US UNTIL DR. DENNING WAS KILLED. HE'S A PRETTY GOOD WITNESS, ISN'T HE? IT'S NO USE, YOUNG MAN. THERE'S NO WAY OUT. [Men Chattering In Native Language] DATU. THE CONDEMNED MEN WERE EXPECTED TO EAT A HEARTY MEAL. - DATU. - DON'T LET HER LEAVE. [Speaking In Native Language] SHE CAN'T HELP NOW. GET HER TO TAKE AWAY THE BAR. BETWEEN US, WE CAN HANDLE THE GUARD. NO, HE'S WATCHING. IF SHE'S QUICK, TAKES HIM BY SURPRISE. [Grunts] [Groans] IT'S NO USE. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE GUARD. THEY'RE VERY CAREFUL. THEY NEVER GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO REACH. I KNOW ONE WAY TO REACH HIM. ALL RIGHT. WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE CHANCE. STAY NEAR THE GATE. DON'T LET THE GIRL GO. KEEP THE GUARD BUSY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? NEVER MIND. DO AS I TELL YOU. [Clinking] POISON TIP? NOT POISON, A PARALYZING DRUG. NOW LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY, ALL OF YOU. IT'S A SIMPLE BLOWGUN. THIS DART WILL IMMOBILIZE A MAN... FOR 30 SECONDS, NO MORE. THE GIRL'S GOT TO GET THAT GATE OPEN IN THAT TIME, OR WE'VE FAILED. NOW BE READY, ALL OF YOU. WHEN WE MOVE, WE GOTTA MOVE FAST. [Crane] SHE'S GOT TO UNDERSTAND. YOU READY? READY. HEY! LET US OUT! HEY! LET US OUT OF HERE! - [Threatening Grunts] - [Bars Clattering] COME ON. HEY. SHE'S AFRAID! SHE WON'T BUDGE! LEE, GET BACK. LEAVE HIM ALONE WITH HER. HURRY! FIFTEEN SECONDS... ALMOST TOO LATE. [Desperate Grunts] THAT'S IT. SHE DID IT. COME HERE. YEAH. [Carol] LOOK OUT! WILL THAT TAKE US TO THE POOL? IT'S ANOTHER WAY OUT... A CAVE BY THE BIG WATER, BUT DANGEROUS, VERY DANGEROUS. A FIRE MONSTER? SHE MAY MEAN A VOLCANO... A LAVA FLOW OF SOME KIND. WHERE WILL THIS TAKE US? THAT'S THE POOL. I VOTE FOR THE POOL. [Chattering] LOOKS LIKE THE POOL'S BEEN OUTVOTED. [Chattering In Native Language] [Shouting] [Yelling Tribesmen Approaching] [Yelling Continues] [Screaming] [Volcano Rumbling] [No Audible Dialogue] [Nelson] LET'S GO. DATU. [Creature Growling] [Screams] - [Screaming] - [Roaring] WE'LL NEVER GET BY. LEE, IF WE CAN BREAK THAT DAM, THE LAVA WILL POUR OUT AND KILL HIM. THAT LOG. IT MIGHT BE THE ANSWER. TRY IT! [Creature Bellows] [Bellowing Continues] I CAN'T GET BY! TRY AND ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION! [Screams] OHHH! NO! [Growls Continue] [Hissing] [Growls] LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! WHEN THAT LAVA HITS THE ICE, THIS WHOLE MOUNTAIN WILL EXPLODE. CURLEY. YES, SIR. - CALL OUT THE LANDING PARTY. - AYE, SIR. AYE, AYE, SIR! LANDING PARTY ON THE DOUBLE! IN AN HOUR, IT'LL BE GONE FOREVER. WE HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT... NOTHING. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. WE HAVE OUR LIVES. CAPTAIN. YES, CHIP. RADAR REPORTS ICEBERG FIELDS AHEAD. VERY WELL.
