IT'S PRETTY MUCKY, SIR. WE CAN TELL BETTER WHEN THE NET COMES UP. IF IT IS THE DANA, HOW CAN THEY ALL BE LOST? WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE HAVE TIME TO LAUNCH A BOAT OR A RAFT? THAT'S WHAT WASHINGTON WANTS US TO FIND OUT. AN OCEANOGRAPHIC VESSEL BLOWS UP WITHOUT WARNING. THE DANA GOES TO ITS RESCUE AND BLOWS UP THE SAME WAY. NOW, WHY? WHAT'S BEHIND IT? [Sailor] UP SLOWLY! EASY NOW. HERE SHE COMES.

IF WE WERE ABLE TO WORK ON THE SURFACE, IT WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH, BUT DOWN HERE, IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME. LET'S STAY DOWN. SOMEBODY THINKS THEY'VE DESTROYED US. WE WANT 'EM TO KEEP ON THINKING THAT FOR A WHILE. YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO PUSH THE MEN.

 AYE, AYE, SIR. TWO SHIPS LOST WITH ALL HANDS. TWO HELPLESS, HARMLESS RESEARCH SHIPS, AND THEN WE GET CLOBBERED TOO. IT'S SENSELESS. I'M SURE IT MADE SENSE TO SOMEBODY. BUT IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP. UNLESS SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO DRIVE ALL SHIPPING OUT OF THESE WATERS. BUT WHY? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE ISLANDS? NOTHING. JUST THE WATERS AROUND THEM. THIS IS WHERE BOTH SHIPS PICKED UP SUPPLIES... AND HIRED EXTRA DIVERS WHEN THEY NEEDED 'EM. I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT ISLAND, LEE... MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE. I KNOW A GOOD WAY TO FIND OUT. MR. LEE GLENN. YES, I HAVE VERY NICE ROOM FOR YOU. HEY, GIORGI. [Speaking Greek] [Greek] YOU'LL FIND THE ROOM AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS. EFHARISTO. [Sighs] CRANE TO SEAVIEW. CRANE TO SEAVIEW. COME IN, SEAVIEW.

YOU SEE, I LIKE TO SKIN-DIVE, SPEARFISH, YOU KNOW. BUT YOUR NATIVE FISHERMEN AREN'T VERY FRIENDLY. THEY WON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THEIR HAPPY HUNTING FISHING GROUNDS. [No Audible Dialogue] - WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? - DIMITRI? HIS MIND IS ALL MIXED UP. - WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? - HE WAS A DIVER... SHIP FIXING, ANY KIND OF JOB UNDER THE WATER. THEN DIMITRI GOT A BIG SALVAGE JOB. HE MUST'VE GONE DOWN PRETTY DEEP, GOT RAPTURES. THEY FOUND HIM WASHED UP ALONG THE SHORE, BOTH AIR TANKS EMPTY. [No Audible Dialogue] I'LL BUY HIM A DRINK. YOU TELL ME WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY. SURE. [Greek] [Greek] HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. AT FIRST, YOU COULD UNDERSTAND SOME OF HIS WORDS, BUT NOT ANYMORE. WHAT WERE THEY? WHAT DID HE TALK ABOUT? ABOUT A CITY HE SAW. YOU SEE? YOU SEE? I TOLD YOU. GO ON. TELL ME MORE. HE SAID HE SAW BUILDINGS, A WHOLE CITY UNDER THE SEA. YOU SAW THIS, DIMITRI? WHERE? WHERE DID YOU SEE THIS? [Croaking Hoarsely] ALL RIGHT. THEN SHOW ME, DIMITRI. SHOW ME WHERE THEY FOUND YOU. ALL RIGHT. COME ON. THANK YOU. [No Audible Dialogue] WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU ALMOST KILLED ME DOWN THERE! I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOMEONE ELSE, SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO HURT ME. I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU. I WAS FRIGHTENED. I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD YOU'RE SAYING. COME ON! PAPA! PAPA! PAPA! PAPA! PAPA! PAPA! [Gasps] PAPA. PAPA. [Sobbing] [Crane] THAT'S WHAT HE SAID... OR TRIED TO SAY ANYWAY. A CITY BENEATH THE SEA. THOUGH MAYBE IT WASN'T EXACTLY A CITY. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE POOR OLD GUY THAT MADE ME BELIEVE HE SAW SOMETHING. I WAS LOOKING FOR IT WHEN HE WAS KILLED. OVER. DOES THE GIRL KNOW ANYTHING? OVER. I HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET. OVER. FIND OUT. STICK WITH HER. NOW GIVE ME THE COORDINATES. WE'LL START SEARCHING THE BOTTOM. REPAIR PARTY'S STILL WORKING ON THE ELEVATOR PLANE, SO I HAVE TO SEND THE MINI-SUB. NOW, THE COORDINATES. OVER. MCV-115. RSL-422. ALL SET, CURLEY? SET LIKE SHE'S OFF ON HER FIRST DATE, ADMIRAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO SAIL INTO, BUT ONCE YOU'RE OUT THERE, I WANT CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION... WHATEVER YOU SEE, HEAR. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A SARDINE. AYE, SIR. [Engine Whirring] [Man On Speaker] A LOT OF SAND ON THE BOTTOM HERE. LOOKS PACKED AND HARD, NOT LIKE SLUDGE. WAIT A MINUTE. SOMETHING COMING UP. UNDERWATER CAVE. LOTS OF HEAVY VEGETATION. RIDGES AND SHELVES. IT'S LIKE A STAIRWAY OUT OF A MOUNTAIN. ATLAS, WHAT SORT OF A MOUNTAIN? CAN'T MAKE IT OUT. [Audio Interference] SONAR? WE'RE BEING JAMMED! WATER TEMPERATURE RISING. CURRENT MOVEMENTS HAVE CHANGED. - ADMIRAL! - WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? CONTROLS... WE'RE GETTING ALL KINDS OF INTERFERENCE. STAY WITH IT. ATLAS. ATLAS? COME IN, ATLAS. [Atlas] CAN'T SEE. LIGHT! BLINDING LIGHT! - WHAT KIND OF A LIGHT? - IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY THREW THE SUN AT US. SKIPPER? SONAR'S GONE WILD. [Atlas] SOMETHING WEIRD'S GOING ON. YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY LOONY. ABSO... [Signals Continue Beeping] ATLAS? ATLAS? MELINA, YOU BELIEVED YOUR FATHER'S STORY, DIDN'T YOU, ABOUT A CITY UNDER THE SEA? OH, YES, BUT THE OTHERS, THEY ONLY LAUGHED. NOBODY BELIEVED HIM... THE VILLAGE CLOWN. "YOU WANT A LAUGH? GO DOWN TO NICOLAS'S BAR ON THE WATERFRONT... "AND BUY DIMITRI A DRINK. "WATCH HIM TRY TO TALK. NICOLAS, HE'LL TELL YOU DIMITRI'S FAIRY TALE ABOUT A CITY UNDER THE SEA." IT WAS WORSE THAN BEING A CIRCUS FREAK. AND NOW PAPA IS OUT THERE IN THE SEA, IN HIS GRAVE. [Whimpering] THANK YOU FOR TODAY, FOR COMING TO THE FUNERAL. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW? KEEP LOOKING FOR THAT CITY, SAME AS I WAS WHEN YOU CAME ALONG. ONLY NOW I HAVE TO FIND THE ONE WHO KILLED PAPA. I AM SURE THAT ONE WILL LEAD TO THE OTHER. THE POLICE SAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT... THAT HE FELL DOWN IN THE WATER AND DROWNED. YOU BELIEVE THE POLICE? I NEVER HEARD OF A GOOD SWIMMER DYING THAT WAY. THERE WAS NEVER A BETTER SWIMMER THAN DIMITRI GOUNARIS. MELINA, IF IT MEANS ANYTHING TO YOU, I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR FATHER WAS A CLOWN. I BELIEVE HE REALLY SAW SOMETHING DOWN THERE, AND SOMEHOW, WE'RE GONNA PROVE IT. NICE NIGHT. I'M SORRY I'M ALL OUT OF BOOZE. I WASN'T EXPECTING COMPANY. NO TROUBLE. NO TROUBLE AT ALL. DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, OR ARE YOU JUST LOST? NO PROBLEMS AND NOT LOST. WORD'S AROUND YOU'RE A DEEP DIVER LOOKING FOR A JOB. OH, WELL, YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PARTY. AND I COULD BE WRONG. I JUST MIGHT HAVE SOME BOOZE. DON'T BOTHER. LET'S GO. RIGHT NOW? TO GET A JOB, SOMEBODY HAS TO HIRE YOU, AND THE MAN WHO HIRES IS THE MAN WHO'S THE BOSS. DO YOU, UH, WANT TO MEET THE BOSS? I WANNA MEET THE BOSS. GOOD. AH, COME IN, MR. GLENN.

BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR. ZERAFF? WHAT MAKES... WHAT MAKES A DIVER SO SPECIAL TO YOU? MY FIRST DIVER BECAME CARELESS HIS FIRST TIME DOWN, WHICH BRINGS YOU TO ME, OR ME TO YOU. NOW, I WANT A MAN TO REPLACE HIM. I NEED ONE NOW. YOU MAKE IT SOUND ALMOST LIKE A ONE-WAY DIVE. I COULD END UP AS ONE OF YOUR EXHIBITS. YOU ARE NOT ONE OF MY PLAYTHINGS, MR. GLENN. BUT I WILL TELL YOU. DOWN THERE LIE GREAT RICHES, AND I AM WILLING TO SHARE SOME OF THEIR VALUE WITH THE MAN WHO GETS THEM FOR ME. HOW MUCH IS SOME, MR. ZERAFF? WELL, IF YOU FIND NOTHING, A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOUR TROUBLE. BUT IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL, 25% TO YOU, 75% TO ME. MR. GLENN? YOU JUST BOUGHT YOURSELF A DIVER, MR. ZERAFF. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. BUT DON'T RUSH OFF. YOU COULD STAY HERE. MY DIVING GEAR'S IN THE HOTEL. OH, WE HAVE PLENTY OF GEAR, I ASSURE YOU. [Bell Dings] WILL YOU SHOW THIS GENTLEMAN TO HIS ROOM?

YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU ARE EITHER. EXCUSE ME. JUST WHAT SWEET LITTLE OLD LADY WERE YOU LOOKING FOR, OR COULD IT BE SOME SWEET LITTLE OLD LADY'S SON? WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? LEE GLENN. ANY MAGIC IN THAT NAME? DO YOU KNOW HIM? I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND HIM. SO HAVE I. WELL, PERHAPS WE'D BETTER TELL EACH OTHER ALL ABOUT IT. SHALL WE? ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU FIRST. ALL RIGHT. WELL, SIT DOWN. NO, THANK YOU. NAME: HARRIMAN JONES. OCCUPATION: LEE GLENN'S FRIEND, ENEMY, PARTNER, RIVAL, BIG BROTHER, BLOOD BROTHER, AND SOMETIMES I'D LIKE TO BASH HIS HEAD IN. - YOU? - I'M MELINA GOUNARIS. HE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. HE OWES ME A HUNDRED BUCKS. THAT'S WHY. TOOK MY LAST DOLLAR AND BEAT IT. BUT I'LL FIND HIM. I AM WORRIED. HE'S BEEN MISSING THREE DAYS. THE HOTEL SAYS HE WASN'T EVEN REGISTERED HERE. MAYBE HE WASN'T. BUT THIS IS HIS ROOM NUMBER. HE TOLD ME. PERHAPS HE WENT TO ANOTHER HOTEL. THERE IS ONLY ONE HOTEL. UM, HOW... HOW'D YOU TWO MEET? ACCIDENTALLY. UNDERWATER. WHEN WE CAME OUT, PAPA WAS LYING JUST ABOUT THERE, HIS FACE IN THE WATER, DEAD. EVERYTHING BEGINS AND ENDS RIGHT HERE, BUT WHY ONLY IN THIS ONE PLACE? WHY DID YOUR FATHER BRING GLENN HERE?

OVER. DO YOU KNOW WHERE? OVER. I'M NOT CERTAIN YET. SEND THE RAFT FOR ME, LANDING BEACH ONE. OVER. AYE, AYE, SIR. SEAVIEW OUT. [Electronic Pulsing] WELCOME, LEE GLENN. CORRECTION: CAPTAIN LEE CRANE. IT'S YOUR GRAPEVINE. I WAS BEGINNING TO ENJOY OUR LITTLE GAME. I WAS BEGINNING TO LIKE YOU. - YOU HAVE A STRONG CHARACTER. - AND YOU HAVE A NICE BIT OF ANTIQUITY DOWN HERE. RELICS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK. STORAGE TANKS OF EXPLOSIVES. SEA SLEDS. UNDERWATER MISSILE PADS. WALL-TO-WALL PUSH BUTTONS. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO ANYWAY? TAKE OVER THE WORLD? THIS IS MY WORLD. I EXPLORED IT, AND I BUILT IT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. MAN IS TOO BUSY TRYING TO CONQUER OUTER SPACE, CAPTAIN. HERE IN THIS INNER SPACE, I AM BUILDING A NEW WORLD. THIS CITY IS JUST THE FIRST OF MANY. SOON THERE WILL BE OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE SEVEN SEAS. AND BEFORE YOUR WORLD AWAKENS TO DISCOVER WHAT IS HAPPENING, I WILL CONTROL ALL THE GREATEST TREASURES OF TIME, UNTAPPED BY MAN. OIL. GOLD. MINERALS. FOOD ENOUGH FOR A HUNDRED LIFETIMES. IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T PLAN ON MUCH FUTURE. IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT FIRST RESEARCH VESSEL GOT SO CURIOUS. I WASN'T READY TO HAVE MY SECRET KNOWN. SO YOU DESTROYED TWO SHIPS, KILLED THEIR CREWS. I WILL DESTROY ANY AND EVERY SHIP THAT THREATENS TO EXPOSE MY PLANS, INCLUDING YOUR SUBMARINE. NOT A CHANCE. I HAVE EVERY CHANCE. WITH THIS INSTRUMENT, I CAN PERFORM MIRACLES. [Electronic Pulsing] I CAN LURE MARINE LIFE INTO TRAPS, THROW OFF THE MOST SENSITIVE SONAR AND RADAR EQUIPMENT, RENDER ANY ACOUSTIC SIGNALS TOO ERRATIC AND UNRELIABLE FOR TRACKING PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE SEAVIEW. YOUR SUBMARINE CAN NEVER TRACK ME DOWN. I DID. I BELIEVE IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND, WAS IT NOT? WELL, FOR ME, YOU ARE NOT EXPENDABLE; YOU ARE NEGOTIABLE, SIR. YOU HAVE A TALENT, CAPTAIN. I COULD USE YOU. YOU COULD NAME YOUR OWN TERMS TO HELP DELIVER ME THE SEAVIEW. YOU'VE GOT RAPTURES OF THE DEEP, LIKE YOU GAVE DIMITRI GOUNARIS. I SAY I'M EXPENDABLE. NELSON HAS ALREADY SACRIFICED TOO MUCH... THE MINI-SUB, THE TWO-MAN CREW. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - BUT OF COURSE. YOU HADN'T HEARD. THEY CAME TOO CLOSE AND HAD TO BE DESTROYED. NELSON WOULDN'T LIKE TO LOSE YOU AS WELL. YOU DON'T KNOW HIM. HE'LL DESTROY YOU AND YOUR CITY. YOU UNDERESTIMATE ME, CAPTAIN. UP THERE, I AM NO MATCH FOR YOU. I AM A SNAIL. DOWN HERE, I'M A SHARK. IN MY BOOK, YOU'RE A MAN-EATING PIRANHA. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. I ACCEPT THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. SHOW THE CAPTAIN TO HIS ROOM, PLEASE. IT'S WHERE GOUNARIS WAS WASHED ASHORE. IT'S WHERE HE TOOK LEE THE DAY HE WAS KILLED. IT'S WHERE THEY SHOT ME BACK INTO THE SEA. NOW, THE DANA WAS BLOWN UP ABOUT HERE. WE WERE DISABLED IN THE SAME SPOT. THAT PUTS THE WHOLE AREA INSIDE ONE RADIUS. IF THERE'S A CITY DOWN THERE, IT HAS TO BE HERE. [Grunting, Yelping] START YOUR CLOCK. [Screams] [All Grunting] [Man] GUARD! GUARD! [Alarm Ringing] GUARD! GUARD! - WE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE MEETING UNDERWATER. - HOW DID YOU GET HERE? THERE WAS THIS MAN, HARRIMAN JONES... HE SAID YOU OWED HIM A HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS IS WHY HE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. UH... THAT'S HARRIMAN JONES EVERY TIME... MONEY. HE'D TRACK YOU TO THE END OF THE EARTH FOR A LEAD QUARTER. HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU. SO WAS I. THIS IS WHY WE WENT BACK TO THE BEACH, AND THEY CAUGHT ME AND BROUGHT ME TO THIS PLACE. DID THEY GET HIM TOO? I DON'T KNOW. I COULDN'T TELL. BUT I HEARD THEM SHOOTING. YOUR FATHER WASN'T DREAMING. HE SAW THE CITY FOR REAL. THEY KILLED HIM FOR IT, AND THEY'LL KILL US. I'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE, MELINA. I PROMISE. [Zeraff] ALMOST ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY. I TOLD YOU ONCE: YOU WON'T MAKE THIS WORK. OH, BUT IT IS WORKING... EXACTLY AS I WANTED IT TO. THAT WAS A FOOLHARDY ATTEMPT, THAT ESCAPE OF YOURS. - I NEARLY MADE IT. - YOU NEVER WOULD'VE COME TO THE SURFACE ALIVE. YOU WERE JUST FORTUNATE. [Man On Speaker] SUPPLY SHIP APPROACHING. RECOGNITION SIGNAL? [Man] AFFIRMATIVE. [Zeraff] THEY'VE PICKED A BAD TIME. THERE'S A SUBMARINE IN THE AREA. [Man] I'LL ALERT THEM TO TURN BACK. [Zeraff] NO. WE NEED SUPPLIES. PUT EVERY AVAILABLE MAN ON THE JOB. UNPACK QUICKLY. ALERT ALL HANDS. [Man] ALERT ALL HANDS. ALERT ALL HANDS. DON'T TRY YOUR LUCK AGAIN, CAPTAIN. AND SUPPOSE I DO? ALL RIGHT. THERE IS A DEEP TRENCH AT THE EDGE OF THE CITY. IT GOES INTO FRIGID COLD, UTTER BLACKNESS. I HAVE OFTEN GONE DIVING INTO THAT TRENCH... TO OBSERVE THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF MARINE LIFE. SOME OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT TAKE PLACE THERE ARE UNBELIEVABLE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO A FISH WHEN IT MAKES AN EFFORT... TO RISE TO A HIGHER LEVEL FROM ITS ENVIRONMENTAL DEPTH? IT'S LIKE TEARING LOOSE FROM GRAVITY. THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP IT. IT LITERALLY DIES FALLING UPWARDS. IT EXPLODES. THE LOWER DEPTHS... THE PRESSURES OF THE SEAS... RESPECT NEITHER FISH NOR HUMAN BEINGS. [Man On Speaker] SUPPLY SHIP READY FOR UNLOADING. I'LL BE THERE AT ONCE. I MUST PERSUADE YOU TO SEE MY POINT OF VIEW. I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE WITH THE YOUNG LADY. IT'LL BE A PITY. SO IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN, I HAVE TO UNLOAD SOME VALUABLE CARGO. IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, CAPTAIN, TO REDUCE THE TEMPTATION... OF TRYING TO MAKE ANOTHER FOOLISH MISTAKE IN MY ABSENCE. HE CALLED YOU "CAPTAIN." NEVER MIND THAT NOW. WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE. THERE'S DIVING GEAR IN THE READY ROOM. WHAT ABOUT THIS? AND THERE'S AN ARMED GUARD IN THE CORRIDOR. I KNOW. I KNOW. THE MAIN CREW IS OUT THERE HELPING UNLOAD. THAT MEANS THERE'S A MAN ON DUTY IN THE CONTROL CENTER AND THE GUARD IN THE CORRIDOR. HE HAS THE KEYS. LET'S INVITE HIM IN. LET'S GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT. COME ON. PILLOWS, BLANKETS, ANYTHING. BUT WHY? COME ON! DO AS I SAY! LOTS OF PILLOWS! BLANKETS! EVERYTHING YOU CAN FIND! THAT'S IT. MORE. [Pulsing] OKAY. [Warning Signal Beeping] I DON'T UNDERSTAND. LOOK. AIR PRESSURE KEEPS THE WATER OUT. IF WE CHANGE THE PRESSURE, THE PLACE'LL FLOOD. THAT'S IT. [Alarm Ringing] [Warning Signals Beeping] [Alarms Ringing] [Ringing Continues] [Crane Coughing] GET BACK! THE AIR! SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO THE AIR! I CAN'T BREATHE! [Coughing] [Gasping] [Continues Coughing] THE KEY! LARGE OBJECTS AHEAD, STATIONARY, LIKE BUILDINGS. ADMIRAL, SONAR'S PICKED UP SOMETHING. IT COULD BE THE CITY. WE'RE MOVING UP CLOSER, SIR. SWITCH ON THE NOSE CAMERA. NOSE CAMERA ON. [Curley] HOLY SMOKE! WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT! [Morton] IT'S A WHOLE CITY JUST SITTING UNDER THE SEA. DISTANCE? [Man] 3,000 YARDS. SLOW TO ONE-THIRD. RIG FOR SILENT RUNNING. SLOW TO ONE-THIRD. RIG FOR SILENT RUNNING. COME ON. COME ON. [Alarms Continue Ringing] - [Ringing] - RED ALERT! RED ALERT! SUBMARINE APPROACHING AT CLOSE RANGE. RED ALERT. RED ALERT. SUBMARINE APPROACHING AT CLOSE RANGE. [Zeraff On Speaker] STARFISH, STARFISH, READY MISSILES. I'M COMING BACK. STARFISH, STARFISH, READY MISSILES. I'M COMING BACK. READY MISSILES. CRANE'S ESCAPED. - HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. - DESTROY THE SUB. I'LL TAKE CARE OF CRANE. DESTROY THE SUB. [Alarms Continue Ringing] FIRE! TORPEDO SALVO, DEAD AHEAD! FULL EVASIVE ACTION! RIG FOR TORPEDO ATTACK! SOUND GENERAL QUARTERS. BATTLE STATIONS. BATTLE STATIONS. [Klaxon Blaring] GET A FIX ON THAT TARGET. AYE, SIR. [Nelson] WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE. WE MUST RETURN THE FIRE. RANGE 2,300, 2,200, 2,100, 2,000. PREPARE TO FIRE. - PREPARE TO FIRE. - PREPARE TO FIRE. [Rubber Puncturing] [Sonar Pinging] - FIRE ONE. - FIRE ONE. - ONE AWAY. - FIRE TWO. - FIRE TWO. - TWO AWAY. [Explosions] WELL, IF IT ISN'T THAT SWEET LITTLE OLD LADY ON A WORLD CRUISE. WELL, SOMEDAY YOU'LL HAVE TO GET HIM TO EXPLAIN THAT. ADMIRAL, THE NEXT TIME, IF YOU CAN'T DO BETTER... THAN THAT HUNDRED-DOLLAR DEADBEAT ROUTINE, I'M GOIN' BACK TO THE NAVY. CAPTAIN CRANE, LET'S SEE THAT OUR GUEST IS ESCORTED HOME. AYE, AYE, SIR. [Crew Laughing]
