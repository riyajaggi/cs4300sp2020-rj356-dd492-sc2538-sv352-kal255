 WHEN YOU REACH 4,000 FEET, ADJUST ATTITUDE TO 1-4-POINT 9. RELAX, HARRIMAN. SHE'LL DO ALMOST EVERYTHING THE SEAVIEW WILL DO. THAT'S WHAT YOU DESIGNED HER FOR. I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT... OUR ENTIRE UNDERSEAS PROGRAM DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF POLIDOR. JUST DON'T FORGET EVERY KEY MAN ON BOARD WAS HANDPICKED FROM SEAVIEW. MARINE INSTITUTE TO POLIDOR. GIVE ME YOUR RATE OF DESCENT. HOLD IT, CONNORS! POLIDOR'S THEORETIC CRUSH DEPTH IS 4,300 FEET. HOW CLOSE WILL YOU LET HIM COME TO IT? I'M GOING TO LEVEL OFF AT 4,200. MARINE INSTITUTE TO POLIDOR. CAN YOU READ ME? SORRY, ADMIRAL. ONE OF OUR BOYS GOT A LITTLE SHOOK UP, BUT HE'S OKAY NOW. I HAVE A RATE OF DESCENT OF 9-DOUBLE 3. WHAT'S THE CONDITION OF YOUR MEN? IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION, LEVEL OFF NOW.

[Shouting, Indistinct] [Overlapping Shouting] [Crewmen's Shouts On Speaker] MARINE INSTITUTE TO POLIDOR. CAN YOU READ ME? - CONFIRM! - [Men Shouting, Indistinct] MARINE INSTITUTE TO POLIDOR. CAN YOU HEAR ME? [Commotion Continues] CONFIRM. CAN YOU HEAR ME? CAPTAIN ANDERS, CAN YOU HEAR ME? [Shouting Continues] [Commotion Continues] ANDERS! ANDERS. ANDERS! [Explosion On Speaker] ANDERS. [Man] VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. STARRING RICHARD BASEHART, DAVID HEDISON. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. KOWALSKI, ALL STORES ARE TO BE ABOARD AND STOWED BY 1000 HOURS TOMORROW. AYE, AYE, SIR. CHIP, HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU... TO REASSEMBLE THE INERTIAL GUIDANCE SYSTEM? IT WAS PRETTY WELL BROKEN DOWN FOR RECALIBRATION. STAY WITH IT ALL NIGHT. AYE, AYE, SIR. LET'S GO, MURDOCK. AND-AND, CHIP, DON'T FORGET TO RESET THE GYROCOMPASS IMMEDIATELY. IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST FOUR HOURS FOR IT TO SETTLE DOWN. I'VE ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF IT, SIR. WERE YOU ABLE TO CONTACT ALL THE MEN ON SHORE LEAVE? WELL, I COULDN'T GET AHOLD OF POWELL OR LACEY. THEIR WIVES SAID THEY WENT ON A FISHING TRIP. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN EXPLANATIONS. I WANT TO KNOW... HOW MANY MEN ARE ON THEIR WAY BACK. SEVEN OUT OF NINE, SIR. YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO GET THEM HERE BEFORE 1000 HOURS TOMORROW, OR THEY'LL BE WAITING ON AN EMPTY DOCK! YES, SIR! [Sighs] UH, LEE, YOU'D BETTER TALK TO LIEUTENANT HENDLEY. MAKE SURE HIS AIR REVITALIZATION SYSTEM IS OPERATIONAL. HENDLEY WAS ON THE POLIDOR, ADMIRAL. HARRIMAN, THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE WANTS A HEARING IN THE MORNING. WE'VE JUST TALKED TO THEM. IT MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DELAY OUR DEPARTURE. WE CAN'T DELAY. - ADMIRAL. - YES. A FEW HOURS ISN'T GONNA MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE MEN OF THE POLIDOR NOW. YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT THAT. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THE POLIDOR TRAGEDY PROVED... THAT MAN CANNOT FUNCTION IN THESE DEPTHS. THE EMOTIONAL STRAIN ALONE CAN CAUSE CONFUSION AND MISCALCULATION. PHILLIP, THAT SIMPLY ISN'T TRUE! I KNOW WE CAN! UNLESS YOUR COMMITTEE TAKES AWAY OUR TOOLS... IF YOU DO THAT, YOU'LL BE SURRENDERING UNTOLD WEALTH IN MINERALS, FOOD AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION... TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITH GREATER COURAGE AND MORE VISION. FORGET OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THE MOMENT. HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POLIDOR? I CAN'T, NOT JUST NOW. BUT I INTEND TO GO DOWN INTO THAT TRENCH WITH SEAVIEW AND FIND OUT. ADMIRAL, IS THIS YOUR SUGGESTION AS A SCIENTIST... OR JUST AS A MAN TRYING TO SALVE HIS CONSCIENCE? THAT'S ENOUGH, DAN. NOW... OH, NO, NO. HE HAS A RIGHT TO ASK THAT QUESTION. I ONLY HOPE I'M ANSWERING IT HONESTLY, AS HONESTLY AS I CAN. I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE I'M A CLINICAL SCIENTIST. I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE. I KNEW HE'D TAKE THAT ATTITUDE. TELL HIM, PHILLIP. VERY WELL. HARRIMAN, WE'LL WITHHOLD JUDGMENT WHILE YOU INVESTIGATE... ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU TAKE SOMEONE WITH YOU AS A TRAINED OBSERVER. TRAINED IN WHAT? HUMAN EMOTIONS. PSYCHOLOGY. DR. ARTHUR KENNER IS A PIONEER IN THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIATRY OF STRESS. JUST, UH, WHAT DOES THIS, UH, KENNER PLAN TO PROVE? WE'VE ALREADY MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE HIM ON BOARD THE SEAVIEW... TO ANALYZE THE REACTIONS OF THE CREW DURING THE DIVE. NOW IF A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS EMOTIONAL CRISIS SHOULD OCCUR, HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CALL OFF THE MISSION. ENOUGH AUTHORITY TO COUNTERMAND THE ADMIRAL'S ORDERS? ON TECHNICAL MATTERS, NO. ON EMOTIONAL MATTERS, YES. THAT'S THE ONLY CONDITION WE'LL ACCEPT, GENTLEMEN. AGREED. BUT WE SHOVE OFF AT 1000 HOURS TOMORROW. I DON'T INTEND TO WAIT FOR ANYONE. I'LL CONFIRM WITH HIM NOW. KENNER WILL BE THERE. [Projector Clattering] AS YOU CAN SEE, BEFORE EXPOSURE TO THE FEAR GAS, THE CAT REACTS TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE MOUSE... IN THE PREDICTABLE MANNER. AND NOW, WE INTRODUCE THE GAS. AND YOU'LL OBSERVE THAT THE EFFECT IS SUCH... AS TO TOTALLY REVERSE THE MOST INSTINCTIVE PROCESSES. THIS IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD IN ISOLATING THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF FEAR. [Phone Ringing] OH, EXCUSE ME. YES. KENNER HERE. OH, PHILLIP. YES. YES, I UNDERSTAND. YES, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WELL, I HOPE SO. I'LL CERTAINLY TRY. WELL, I'LL BE ABOARD THE SEAVIEW FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. GOOD-BYE. OH. UH, GENTLEMEN, THE FILM YOU HAVE JUST SEEN ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECTS... OF THE NEW FEAR GAS. MOST INTERESTING. IT'S THE END PRODUCT OF THE WORK IN WHICH... EACH OF YOU HAS HAD SOME PART. THIS CONTAINER OF FEAR GAS REPRESENTS OUR COMBINED EFFORTS. I REGRET THAT SECURITY REGULATIONS... HAVE PREVENTED ME FROM LETTING ANY ONE OF YOU KNOW... THE FULL DETAILS OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON. AND NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I-I'LL HAVE TO CUT THIS SESSION SHORT. GOOD NIGHT, DOCTOR. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT OUR FEAR GAS, DOCTOR. IT SEEMS ABOUT READY FOR HUMAN APPLICATION. NOT QUITE. AS YOU KNOW, MARTIN, FEAR IN THE LOWER ANIMALS... IS BASED ON SIMPLE SURVIVAL INSTINCT. HOWEVER, HUMAN FEAR IS... IS FAR MORE COMPLICATED AND PERSONAL. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT HUMANS REACT TO THE GAS. I MEAN, I ASSUME WE DO. THAT'S ANOTHER THING. THE GAS ITSELF... IT IS NOT QUITE READY. WELL NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. I'VE... I'VE GOT A THOUSAND THINGS TO DO. I'VE GOT TO BE IN SANTA BARBARA FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. UM, HAVE YOU DECIDED YET ABOUT TAKING AN ASSISTANT? I SPOKE TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT IT, AND THEY LEFT THE DECISION UP TO ME. WELL, WITH 125 MEN TO OBSERVE, YOU'LL NEED SOME HELP. I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO GO ALONG. I MUST ADMIT YOU WOULD BE OF HELP. CAN YOU BE READY AT 6:00 A. M.? NO PROBLEM. FINE. WELL, THEN LOCK UP, MEET ME IN THE MORNING, AND I'LL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS... TO INCLUDE YOU IN THE PARTY. SPLENDID. GOOD-BYE, DOCTOR. [Phone Ringing] YOU'RE LATE. [Doctor] KENNER JUST LEFT. THE TRIP IS ON. HE BOARDS SEAVIEW IN THE MORNING. DID HE AGREE TO LET YOU COME ALONG? WITHOUT HESITATION. AND THE FEAR GAS? I'VE GOT ALL WE NEED... ONE CONTAINER. ENOUGH TO TURN NELSON AND HIS CREW INTO PANIC-STRICKEN MADMEN. ARE YOU SURE OF THIS GAS? IT WORKED ON THE POLIDOR, DIDN'T IT? BUT YOU WERE NOT ON THE POLIDOR, AND YOU WILL BE ON THE SEAVIEW. THIS TIME THE SUB MUST RETURN WITH ITS REPORT. BELIEVE ME. I INTEND TO RETURN. BUT YOU WILL BE BREATHING THE GAS TOO. ACCORDING TO KENNER'S NOTES, THE INTENSITY OF THE EFFECT... DIMINISHES IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SUBJECT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUSE. IN OTHER WORDS, KNOWLEDGE BUILDS A CERTAIN IMMUNITY TO FEAR. WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU, YOU FEAR IT LESS. JUST BE SURE THAT NELSON ISN'T IMMUNE. HE MUST BE CONVINCED THAT MAN CANNOT FUNCTION AT SUCH EXTREME DEPTHS. ONCE HE TESTIFIES TO THAT EFFECT, THE UNITED STATES WILL SUSPEND FURTHER EXPLORATION PROJECTS... AND LEAVE THE RICHES OF THE SEA TO US. - IS THAT CLEAR? - VERY CLEAR. [Buzzing] [Knocking] COME IN. DR. KENNER JUST CAME ABOARD, ADMIRAL. HE BROUGHT AN ASSISTANT WITH HIM. I KNOW. THE COMMITTEE ASKED ME TO OKAY ANOTHER PASSENGER. STAND BY TO GET UNDER WAY. I'VE ALREADY PASSED ALONG THE ORDER. THANK YOU, LEE. OH, BY THE WAY, TELL SPARKS TO MAINTAIN RADIO SILENCE AS TO OUR OBJECTIVE. AYE, AYE, SIR. [Knocking] ADMIRAL, THIS IS DR. ARTHUR KENNER. CRANE. GOOD MORNING, ADMIRAL. OH, THIS IS MY ASSISTANT DR. MARTIN DAVIS. HOW DO YOU DO? WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO A MOST INTERESTING CRUISE. THESE ARE YOUR QUARTERS, DR. KENNER. I HOPE YOU'LL FIND THEM COMFORTABLE. FINE. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT DOOR, DR. DAVIS. UH, "AIR REVITALIZING"? YES. IT'S THE SYSTEM THAT PURIFIES AND RECIRCULATES THE AIR IN THE SUB. IT ALLOWS US TO STAY SUBMERGED FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME. AH. NOW THESE ARE THE OUTLETS FOR PURE AIR. THE EXHAUST VENTS ARE AT DECK LEVEL. OH, MADISON. IN HERE. UH, CAPTAIN. I'D LIKE A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO AS MANY OF THE CREWMEN AS I CAN. DR. KENNER WANTS ME TO PREPARE SOMETHING OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE ON THEM. I'LL ARRANGE IT. IT'LL HAVE TO BE BASED ON THEIR DUTY SCHEDULE. WE'RE A LITTLE SHORTHANDED. YES. SO MANY OF YOUR MEN WERE LOST ON THE POLIDOR, WEREN'T THEY? WELL, THANKS FOR THE GUIDED TOUR, CAPTAIN. I, UH... I HOPE YOU DIDN'T MIND INDULGING A SCIENTIST'S NATURAL CURIOSITY. NOT AT ALL. OH, ONE MORE THING. THERE'S A SECURITY REGULATION... THAT ALL PERSONAL PROPERTY BROUGHT ABOARD HAS TO BE INSPECTED. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND INDULGING US IN THIS. NOT IN THE LEAST. EH, IT'S JUST ROUTINE, SIR. FROM APPRENTICE SEAMAN TO CONGRESSMAN, EVERYBODY GETS A PERSONAL PROPERTY CHECK. WELL, THAT'S DEMOCRACY FOR YOU. AND A GREAT THING IT IS TOO. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. TELL ME, SAILOR. YOU MUST'VE HAD A LOT OF BUDDIES ON THE POLIDOR. YEAH, A COUPLE. TRAGIC THING. ANY CHANCE THEY'RE STILL ALIVE? - NO. - WHY, YOU NEVER CAN TELL. THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE IT TO THE SURFACE. NOT FROM A TRENCH EIGHT MILES DEEP. MAYBE THEY'RE STILL ALIVE DOWN THERE. ONLY A COUPLE OF COMPARTMENTS FLOODED. NAH, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT, DOC, NOT THAT DEEP. IT JUST GOES, AND THEN THERE'S NOTHING. NOTHING! WELL, I'M SORRY, SAILOR. I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU ALL THOSE QUESTIONS. AW, IT'S OKAY. I... THERE'S NOTHING HERE, KOWALSKI. OKAY. THANK YOU. I GUESS I MISSED THIS ONE. I'LL HAVE TO CHECK IT TOO. SEEMS TO BE LOCKED. OH, YEAH. I'VE, UH... I'VE GOT A KEY. [Muttering] UH, IT'S A TAPE RECORDER. I USE IT IN MY INTERVIEWING. WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK. SURE IT DOES. LOOK. [Clicks] THERE. SEE? HERE, COME ON. SAY SOMETHING. NO, GO AHEAD. NAH. [Chuckles] WHAT SHOULD I SAY? ANYTHING YOU LIKE. COME ON. YOU EVER HEARD YOUR OWN VOICE? COME ON. UH, NO. MAYBE LATER, HUH, DOC? ALL RIGHT. YOU GONNA TALK TO ALL THE GUYS ON THE CREW? AS MANY AS I CAN, BEFORE WE MAKE THE DIVE. I CAN SAVE YOU A LOT OF TROUBLE, DOC. THESE GUYS DON'T SCARE SO EASY. YOU NAME IT, THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH IT. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT, SAILOR? YOU DON'T THINK MUCH OF THE POLIDOR AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM? OH, YOU GOT THE WRONG MAN, DOC. HE'S GOT THE SAFEST JOB ON BOARD. HE WORKS IN THE COMPARTMENT WITH THE ESCAPE BELL. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, HE'S THE FIRST MAN OUT. IS THAT RIGHT? WELL, WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SAILOR? PATTERSON, SIR. PATTERSON, DO YOU THINK MUCH OF THE CHANCE... OF BEING THE ONLY MAN WHO MIGHT ESCAPE ALIVE? NO. I-I MEAN, I... I THINK ABOUT IT, SIR. BUT... COURSE, THE FELLOW WHO HAD YOUR JOB ON THE POLIDOR... DIDN'T GET OUT AT ALL, DID HE? UH, HOW LONG DO YOU NORMALLY STAY SUBMERGED? OH, UH, IT DEPENDS... A WEEK, 10 DAYS AT A TIME, DEPENDING UPON THE MISSION. [Davis] DOES IT FRIGHTEN YOU TO BE GOING DOWN 4,500 FEET IN AN EGGSHELL? WELL, SIR, I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY. WELL, YOU THINK ABOUT IT, PATTERSON. ANYTHING? LET ME KNOW OF ANY VARIANCES. AYE, SIR. WE'RE RIGGED FOR SILENT RUNNING. WHO AUTHORIZED THAT? THE ADMIRAL, WHILE YOU WERE FORWARD. DID HE COME TO THE CONTROL ROOM? NO, HE'S LOCKED IN HIS CABIN. CAME OVER THE INTERCOM. ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL AT THE TRENCH 0923 HOURS. LET'S SEE. THAT'S ABOUT A HALF HOUR. LEE, IS THE ADMIRAL OKAY? I MEAN, NONE OF US HAVE SEEN HIM SINCE WE LEFT THE INSTITUTE, AND ALL THIS WARTIME ALERT BUSINESS... A LOT OF THE MEN ARE STARTING TO WORRY. I'LL GO SEE HIM NOW. [Nelson On Tape] MARINE INSTITUTE TO POLIDOR. CAN YOU READ ME? CONFIRM! [Men Shouting, Indistinct] [Nelson's Voice] MARINE INSTITUTE TO POLIDOR. CAN YOU HEAR ME? CONFIRM! [Shouting Continues] CAN YOU HEAR ME? CAPTAIN ANDERS, CAN YOU HEAR ME? [Shouting Continues] ANDERS! ANDERS. ANDERS! [Explosion] ADMIRAL? ADMIRAL. OH. YES, LEE. WE'LL BE THERE IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR. GOOD. I'VE CHECKED AND RECHECKED THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE POLIDOR FOR ANY MISCALCULATION. IT HAD TO BE SOMETHING ELSE. YOU ORDERED US RIGGED FOR SILENT RUNNING. MAY I ASK WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO POLIDOR OUT HERE, AND I'M TAKING NO CHANCES WITH SEAVIEW. SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ATTACKED, NOT AT THAT DEPTH. PERHAPS NOT, BUT, UH, MAYBE, UH... MAYBE IT WAS SABOTAGE. THERE'S NO REASON TO CHECK THE STORES BROUGHT ABOARD. ALMOST ANYTHING COULD'VE BEEN PLANTED ON THAT SUB. NOTHING'S BEEN PLANTED ON THIS ONE. WE RAN A COMPLETE SECURITY CHECK. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. [Creaking] [Buzzing] [Buzzing] DEPTH READING. 3,400 FEET, SIR. THE FATHOMETER INDICATES THE OCEAN DEPTHS AT ANY GIVEN POINT. WITH THIS AND OUR PRECISION DEPTH RECORDER, WHICH ACTUALLY GRAPHS THE CONTOURS OF THE BOTTOM, WE ALWAYS KNOW WHAT'S UNDER OUR KEEL. GENTLEMEN, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN A TRENCH THAT REACHES DOWN... NEARLY EIGHT MILES. A REMARKABLE SHIP, ADMIRAL, AND AN INCREDIBLE CREW. IF ANY MEN WERE TO SURVIVE AT THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN, IT WOULD BE THEY. YOU SOUND AS IF YOU DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION, DR. KENNER? EIGHT MILES. HOW FAR DOWN DO YOU INTEND TO GO, ADMIRAL? AS FAR AS NECESSARY TO FIND POLIDOR. UH, YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION, DOCTOR. EH, WHAT? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MEN CAN FUNCTION UNDER THE CONTINUAL THREAT OF A GHASTLY DEATH? WELL, DEATH, WE'RE... WE'RE ALL FACING DEATH. I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN THOUGH. I COULD CANCEL THIS MISSION. I COULD ABORT THIS DIVE. ONLY ON SUFFICIENT GROUNDS, DOCTOR. NOW, WE CAN'T GO MUCH DEEPER. WE CAN'T GO MUCH DEEPER. WE CAN'T. YOU'RE NOT QUESTIONING THE DOCTOR'S AUTHORITY, ARE YOU? HIS AUTHORITY IS ESTABLISHED. I CAN'T SAY AS MUCH ABOUT HIS JUDGMENT. DEPTH READING. - PRYOR. - SIR? LOOK SHARP. THIS IS NO TIME FOR DAYDREAMING. 3,750 FEET, SIR. HOW MUCH FARTHER, CAPTAIN? SETTLE DOWN, PRYOR. I DON'T LIKE THIS ANY MORE THAN YOU DO. [Buzzing] DEPTH READING. 4,050 FEET, SIR. THIS DEVICE IS A MAGNETOMETER. IT'LL PICK UP ANY TRACE OF METAL IN THE AREA. THEN I TAKE IT WE'RE CLOSE TO THE DEPTH WHERE THE POLIDOR WAS CRUSHED. THAT'S RIGHT. [Sighs] WELL, I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU, I'M... I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. NEVER BEEN IN A SITUATION QUITE LIKE THIS BEFORE. IT TAKES A LITTLE GETTING USED TO. ANYTHING? I'M NOT SURE. NOT SURE? GIVE ME THAT! CHANGE HEADING TO 2-0-9 DEGREES. [Crane] 2-0-9 DEGREES. [Switches Clicking] I MAKE OUT METAL CONTACT ABOUT 300 FEET BELOW. [Crewman] IT COULD BE. I'M NOT SURE. YOU BETTER SHAPE UP, SAILOR. YOU'RE AS MUCH A PART OF THIS MISSION AS ANYONE ELSE ON THE SUB! ADMIRAL, TAKE IT EASY. THIS MAN'S OBVIOUSLY UNNERVED. AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING ANY. I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO BE REALISTIC. YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT THESE MEN... ALL OF THEM... ARE AFRAID, DEATHLY AFRAID. WELL, BEING AFRAID IS NO CRIME... OR SIGN OF WEAKNESS, DOCTOR. ONLY A FOOL WOULD DENY THERE'S DANGER HERE. THEN YOU'RE AFRAID TOO? OF COURSE I AM. BUT MY BIG FEAR IS NOT DEATH. THAT'S ALWAYS WITH US, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE MEN ARE USED TO IT, AND SO AM I. BUT WE'RE NOT USED TO FAILURE, DOCTOR. AND THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME: THE CHANCE THAT THIS MISSION MIGHT FAIL... WHEN I KNOW THAT IT HAS EVERY REASON TO SUCCEED. ADMIRAL? WE MUST BE APPROACHING OUR CRUSH DEPTH BY NOW. - WHAT'S OUR READING? - 4,300 FEET, SIR. CONTINUE DIVE. NO! GO BACK, PLEASE. I ORDER YOU TO GO BACK. ADMIRAL, DID YOU HEAR ME? I ORDER YOU TO GO BACK. I ORDER YOU TO YOUR CABIN, DOCTOR. RIGHT NOW. THIS MISSION IS ENDED. I HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. CAPTAIN CRANE, I DEMAND THAT YOU SURFACE AT ONCE! THIS MISSION IS OVER. DO YOU HEAR ME, CAPTAIN CRANE? CONTINUE DIVE, CAPTAIN. I HAVE THIS AUTHORITY. I CAN ABORT THIS DIVE. STAND BY, ALL STATIONS. WE'RE APPROACHING MAXIMUM DEPTH. [Nelson] MR. MORTON, ESCORT DR. KENNER TO HIS QUARTERS. AYE, AYE, SIR. I SHALL REPORT THIS. UH... DR. KENNER. [Buzzing] THE SLIGHTEST... MALFUNCTION... [On Speaker] CAN BE CRITICAL, MEN. SO STAY ON YOUR TOES. [Microphone Clicks] ADMIRAL, YOU DELIBERATELY IGNORED DR. KENNER'S ORDER. HE HAD AUTHORITY TO ABORT THIS MISSION. ONLY ON PSYCHOLOGICAL GROUNDS. AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY INCAPABLE OF MAKING SUCH A JUDGMENT. MY REPORT WILL OVERLOOK THIS INCIDENT, IF YOU STOP THE DIVE HERE AND NOW. DR. KENNER WAS SCARED GREEN. I CONSIDER HIS COMMAND INCOMPETENT. AND YOU AREN'T FRIGHTENED? YOU'VE ALREADY ADMITTED IT, ADMIRAL. YOU'RE AFRAID OF FAILURE. SO AFRAID, YOU'RE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THE LIVES OF A HUNDRED MEN. IS YOUR PRIDE WORTH A HUNDRED LIVES, ADMIRAL? ARE YOU THAT... ADMIRAL NELSON! METAL CONTACT CONFIRMED. MAYBE 150 FEET DOWN. ACTIVATE NOSE CAMERA. THIS TRENCH GOES DOWN TO 48,000 FEET. HOW COULD THERE BE ANYTHING AT THIS DEPTH? IT'S PROBABLY A LEDGE. 4,450 FEET, SIR. [Klaxon Blaring] DAMAGE CONTROL! DAMAGE CONTROL, REPORT. [Curley On Speaker] IT'S OKAY, CAPTAIN, JUST A PIN LEAK IN THE MISSILE ROOM. IT'S UNDER CONTROL. 4,500 FEET, SIR. - METAL CONTACT, 50 FEET. - ALL STOP. LEVEL OFF. WE'VE GOT TO GET IN CLOSER. ADMIRAL, WE'RE AT CRUSH DEPTH. WE CAN'T GO THIS DEEP. CLOSER, CAPTAIN! ALL AHEAD. DEAD SLOW. THEY THINK THEY FOUND SOMETHING. IT MIGHT BE THE POLIDOR... ON THE LEDGE RIGHT OUT THERE. ANDERS. HENDLEY. ALL OF THEM. SO CLOSE, YOU COULD ALMOST... [Banging] [Banging Continues] - [Banging] - IT'S LIKE... LIKE SOMEBODY'S OUT THERE. [Buzzing] [Banging Continues] ONE OF THEM'S STILL ALIVE. ONE OF THEM'S STILL ALIVE. LISTEN TO HIM, HE'S... HE'S STILL IN THERE. HE'S STILL ALIVE! I'M GETTIN' OUT. HEY! [Klaxon Blaring] [Overlapping Shouting] ELEVATE BOW PLANES. BLOW AFT TRIM TANK. TAKE HER UP! HOLD THAT. TAKE HER UP. TAKE HER UP. TAKE HER UP TO 3,500 FEET... AND HOLD THERE. TAKE HER UP 3,500 FEET. HOLD THERE. WHEN YOU GET A REPORT FROM DAMAGE CONTROL, BRING IT TO MY CABIN. IT'S DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT, CAPTAIN, BUT FEAR TAKES MANY FORMS. AND IT'S ALWAYS DESTRUCTIVE, EVEN IN A MAN LIKE NELSON. YOU HAVE TO TAKE OVER, CAPTAIN, FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR CREW AND OF THE SEAVIEW ITSELF. HE'LL PUSH US DOWN TO DESTRUCTION IF YOU DON'T. WE'RE IN YOUR HANDS NOW, CAPTAIN. [Buzzing] CAPTAIN CRANE. DAMAGE CONTROL REPORT. WE FIGURE THE WORST DAMAGE IS IN NUMBER TWO. PROBABLY GET IT IN SHAPE IN A HALF HOUR. CAPTAIN, WE'RE NOT GONNA DIVE AGAIN, ARE WE? WHY? I DON'T THINK THE MEN COULD TAKE IT, SIR. ALL RIGHT, CURLEY. THAT'S ALL. FRANKLY, NEITHER CAN I. I SAID, THAT'S ALL, CHIEF! YES, SIR. ADMIRAL. I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE ORDER TO SURFACE. ARE THE DAMAGE CONTROL REPORTS THAT BAD? NO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THEY'RE RELATIVELY MINOR. - WE WERE LUCKY THIS TIME. - THEN WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE MEN CAN HOLD UP UNDER ANOTHER DEEP DIVE. I SEE. AND WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE? SURFACE NOW. MAYBE GO DOWN AGAIN WHEN THEY'RE IN BETTER SHAPE. I'LL MAKE THAT DECISION, CAPTAIN. IF WE SURFACE NOW, WE'LL BE ADMITTING THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS RIGHT. MAYBE THEY WERE. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO POLIDOR. IT COULD'VE BEEN SABOTAGE. I'VE GOT TO FIND THAT OUT. THAT'S THE SECOND TIME YOU'VE MENTIONED SABOTAGE. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT POLIDOR WAS DELIBERATELY SUNK! [Pounds Desk] THERE'S GOT TO BE! THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWER. WHY? BECAUSE ANY OTHER ANSWER WOULD LAY THE DEATHS OF 85 MEN AT YOUR FEET? YOU MAY BE WILLING TO DIE RATHER THAN ADMIT YOU MADE A MISTAKE, BUT I'M NOT GONNA DIE WITH YOU AND NEITHER ARE THE MEN ON THIS SHIP! CAPTAIN CRANE! AS SOON AS REPAIRS ARE COMPLETED, THE SEAVIEW WILL CONTINUE THE SEARCH. SO HELP ME, IF YOU MAKE ONE MOVE TO PREVENT IT, I'LL TAKE YOUR COMMAND AND PUT YOU UNDER ARREST! THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WANT MORE THAN TO GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW, TAKE THE SEAVIEW UP TO THE SURFACE, AND PUT ALL THIS BEHIND US. BUT I CAN'T DO IT. I WON'T DO IT, LEE. NOT YET. NOT AT ANY PRICE. [Buzzing] WHAT'S TROUBLING YOU, CHIEF? NOTHING WE CAN'T HANDLE. ALL CLEAR NOW, CHIEF. WHAT DO YOU HEAR, DOC? HEAR? I HEAR WE'RE GOING BACK UP. WE'LL ALL BE GOING HOME. THAT OUGHT TO PLEASE THE MEN, HUH? YEAH. YOU'VE ALL BEEN UNDER TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRAIN. I KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS. BUT ONCE WE GET BACK UP, HAVE A BIT OF REST, YOU'LL BE FINE. [On Speaker] NOW HEAR THIS. THIS IS CAPTAIN CRANE. ALL PERSONNEL WILL MAN THEIR DUTY STATIONS AND STAND BY TO DIVE. [Knocking] COME IN. OH, MARTIN. DR. KENNER, THOSE OFFICERS ARE ACTING LIKE MADMEN. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP THEM. LOOK AT ME. I'M SOMETHING OF A MADMAN MYSELF. YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ABORT THIS MISSION. USE IT, BEFORE THEY MURDER ALL OF US. YOU'RE AFRAID TOO, AREN'T YOU? WITH NELSON AND CRANE IN CHARGE, WE'RE ALL AFRAID. AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SCARED TO DEATH. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. I SHOULDN'T FEEL THIS WAY, MARTIN. I-I KNOW BETTER. I'M ACTING LIKE A VICTIM OF MY OWN FEAR GAS. WELL, THAT'S HARDLY POSSIBLE. AND A GOOD THING TOO, OR WE'D ALL BE DEAD. - DEAD? - YES. DANGEROUS STUFF THAT FEAR GAS. IT'S... IT'S TOO UNSTABLE. YES. LOOK AT ME. NOTHING BUT NERVES. WHY DO I ACT THIS WAY, MARTIN? I KNOW BETTER. I TELL MYSELF... WHAT DO YOU MEAN TOO UNSTABLE? WELL, IT'S-IT'S JUST... THE FEAR GAS, TELL ME, I'VE GOT TO KNOW! WELL, IT'S-IT'S NOT... IT'S UNSTABLE. IT'S NOT READY TO USE ON HUMANS YET. IT-IT CHANGES ITS PROPERTIES AFTER EIGHT HOURS. THE FEAR GAS BECOMES A, UH-UH-UH, A NERVE GAS. NERVE GAS! YES. WORKS DIRECTLY ON THE BRAIN. DEADLIER THAN ANY GAS... [Groans] NO! WHAT'S THE MATTER, MARTIN? WHAT'S THE MATTER? GET OUT OF MY WAY. WHAT ABOUT THE FEAR GAS? I SAID, GET OUT OF MY... [Buzzing] [Grunting] [Straining] [Yells] [Crane On Speaker] STAND BY TO DIVE. DIVE! DIVE! DEPTH. 4,470 FEET, SIR. [Headphones Clatter] THAT'S TOO FAR, ADMIRAL. THAT'S TOO FAR. SIT DOWN, PRYOR. [Babbling] NOW, LOOK! I SAID, SIT DOWN! LET GO OF ME! CLARK, TAKE HIM TO SICK BAY! GET ME OUT OF HERE! I DON'T WANNA DIE! LET ME OUT OF HERE! [Pryor On Speaker] LET ME OUT OF HERE! I DON'T WANNA DIE! METAL CONTACT, 40 FEET, DEAD AHEAD. SWITCH ON NOSE CAMERA. 4,480 FEET. JUST A LITTLE WRECKAGE, ADMIRAL. PREPARE TO ACTIVATE DIVING BELL. WE'LL HAVE TO BRING SOME OF IT IN. [Loud Crashing] [Klaxon Blaring] HOLD THAT VALVE. WE SPRUNG A LEAK! CONTROL! [Klaxon Blaring] EXTINGUISHER! FIRE CONTROL! DAMAGE CONTROL! DAMAGE CONTROL! DAMAGE CONTROL. PORT FORWARD TRIM TANK VALVE'S JAMMED! CAN WE HOLD TRIM AND BLOW BALLAST TO SURFACE? NOT WITH THOSE VALVES FROZEN. MISSILE ROOM, CAN'T YOU WORK THOSE VALVES LOOSE BY HAND? I THINK SO, CAPTAIN. IT'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE TIME. COME ON, PATTERSON. CAPTAIN, YOU MUST SURFACE IMMEDIATELY! - ENGINE ROOM, HOW ARE... - YOU MUST SURFACE NOW. - THAT'S AN ORDER, CAPTAIN. - DR. DAVIS. WHY MUST WE SURFACE NOW? BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, WE'LL ALL DIE. DIE? WHY? WHY WILL WE DIE? I PUT A GAS DEVICE IN THE AIR CIRCULATING SYSTEM. WHERE IS IT? IT SLIPPED INTO THE MAIN DUCT. YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT IN TIME. IT'S FEAR GAS. IN EIGHT HOURS, IT BECOMES UNSTABLE. THE EIGHT HOURS ARE UP. IT'LL BREAK DOWN INTO NERVE GAS AT ANY MOMENT. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO POLIDOR? TELL ME! YES. [Sobs] SHUT OFF THE REVITALIZATION UNIT. DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID? YOU'VE GOT TO SURFACE NOW! WE CAN'T SURFACE NOW! WE CAN'T SURFACE NOW. OUR CONTROLS ARE JAMMED! MUST BE A WAY. THERE MUST BE. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING. LEE, GET HIM OUT OF HERE! [Davis Muttering] THERE MUST BE SOMETHING. SEAL UP ALL VENTS. AYE, SIR. WE'LL GO ON ESTABLISHED AIR UNTIL WE SURFACE. ADMIRAL, EVEN WITH THE VENTS CLOSED, THE SUBMARINE IS STILL FULL OF RESIDUAL GAS, ENOUGH TO KILL US. I KNOW. WHAT IF WE HEATED IT? RAISED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WHOLE BOAT? THE GAS WILL RISE. IT'LL CLING TO THE CEILING. BREAK OUT ALL EMERGENCY HEATING UNITS. GIVE US ALL THE HEAT YOU CAN. PASS THE WORD TO THE CREW... THIS BOAT IS GOING TO BE A SWEATBOX! [Chattering, Indistinct] WHAT'S UP THERE? HYDRAULIC ARM IS FOULED! SHE WON'T GIVE, CHIEF. GIVE ME THAT CHAIN AND COME ON. GIVE ME THE OTHER END. LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. JAMMED. KEEP DOWN, ALL OF YOU. I'LL TRY IT AGAIN. NO GOOD, SKIPPER. SHE'S JAMMED TIGHT. CAPTAIN, WE'RE STILL LOSING TRIM. MANEUVERING ONE... CAN YOU CUT IN ANOTHER AIR COMPRESSOR? ALREADY ASKED. THEY'RE TRYING TO RECHARGE THE AIR BANKS WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE. KEEP ON IT. DEPTH. 4,580 FEET AND STILL SLIPPING. COME ON. WE'VE GOT TO FREE THESE VALVES. [Grunting] IT'S COMIN'! I CAN FEEL IT! IT'S STARTIN' TO GIVE! SHUT UP AND STOP USIN' UP AIR! [Grunts] IT'S COMIN'! I CAN FEEL IT! WE GOT IT FREE! TAKE THAT CHAIN OFF AND LET'S SEE. [Grunting] [Curley] IT'S FREE! I GOT TO TELL THE CAPTAIN. GO ON. WE'RE STILL LOSING TRIM, CAPTAIN. IF WE GET OUT OF HERE... [Sighs] THIS SHOULD ANSWER THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTION ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE HARD WAY. CAPTAIN, THE VALVES ARE CLEARED. THEY'RE CLEAR! [Chuckling] OKAY, LET'S GO! [Men Laughing] [Crewman ] MAN YOUR STATIONS. TAKE HER ON UP! BLOW BALLAST TANKS! TAKE HER UP. SHE'S FREE! WE MADE IT! LET'S SKEDADDLE. PURE UN-REVITALIZED AIR... JUST LIKE MOTHER USED TO BREATHE.
