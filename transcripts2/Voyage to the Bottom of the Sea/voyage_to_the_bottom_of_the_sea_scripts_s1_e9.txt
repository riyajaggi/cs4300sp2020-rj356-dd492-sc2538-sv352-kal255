 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964â€“1968): Season 1, Episode 9 - Hot Line - full transcript 
 The Soviets have launched a rocket carrying a new satellite to be placed in orbit around the Earth. Everything is proceeding normally when they lose control of the rocket and their power to abort it. The rocket with its nuclear pile will fall back to Earth and splashdown near the San Franciscan coast. The Seaview is ordered to pick up two Russian missile experts and find the rocket and disarm the nuclear pile before detonation.

 THEN DESTROY THE ROCKET IMMEDIATELY! YES. YES, I SEE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN? HOLD ON. COMRADE CHAIRMAN, SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE SATELLITE'S CONTROL SYSTEM, AND THE ABORT MECHANISM ALSO HAS FAILED. THERE IS NOW NOTHING TO PREVENT THE SATELLITE FROM FALLING BACK TO EARTH... WITH CATASTROPHIC RESULTS. WHERE? [Whispering] THIS IS THE CHAIRMAN. I WISH TO SPEAK IMMEDIATELY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [Man] VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.

 DAVID HEDISON. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. [Buzzing] YES? YES, MR. CHAIRMAN. I WILL WAKE HIM. YES, AT ONCE. MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S THE KREMLIN. THE HOT LINE, SIR. YES, SIR. I'LL SET IT UP AT ONCE. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT. THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING A TOP SECRET MEETING OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. INSTRUCT EVERY MEMBER YOU CAN REACH TO GET HERE IMMEDIATELY. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT. YOU SENT FOR ME, ADMIRAL? YES, LEE. HOW SOON CAN WE REACH THESE COORDINATES? WELL, AT OUR PRESENT SPEED, I'D SAY, UH, 15 MINUTES. GOOD. WE'RE TO RENDEZVOUS WITH A SHIP THERE AND PICK UP A PASSENGER. HUH. YOU LOOK SURPRISED. WELL, I AM. RADAR HAS A FIX ON THAT SHIP. IT'S A RUSSIAN TRAWLER. I KNOW. WE'RE PICKING UP A RUSSIAN PASSENGER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN? ORDERS DIRECT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THE WHITE HOUSE? MM-HMM. WE RUN SUBMERGED THE REST OF THE WAY. NOW GET AT IT. AYE, SIR. IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER FISHING TRAWLER. YOU'D NEVER GUESS IT WAS A RUSSIAN TRACKING STATION. [Crane On Speaker] OUR PASSENGER'S ABOARD, ADMIRAL. VERY WELL. NEVER THOUGHT WE'D BE RENDEZVOUSING WITH A RUSSIAN SHIP MID-PACIFIC. [Man] CATCH. HERE HE COMES, SIR. RENDEZVOUS PERFECT, LEE. THANKS, SIR. MR. MALINOFF, ADMIRAL NELSON. WELCOME ABOARD. GREGORY MALINOFF, TECHNICIAN, FIRST CLASS. ORDER OF LENIN. THANK YOU, SIR. YOU'VE MET CAPTAIN CRANE. THIS IS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COMMANDER MORTON. SIR. I'LL SHOW YOU TO YOUR QUARTERS. IS COMRADE GRONSKI ABOARD? HE'S BEING FLOWN IN FROM MOSCOW. WE'LL PICK HIM UP AT OUR BASE IN SANTA BARBARA. YOUR PRESIDENT HAS AUTHORIZED... A RUSSIAN ABOARD SEAVIEW? WHAT GIVES? - SEARCH ME. - WE SHOULD HAVE WORD AT ANY MOMENT. WE WILL NEED EXACT DATA. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOUR NEXT COMMUNICATION. WELL? ALL EFFORTS TO DESTROY THE SATELLITE HAVE FAILED. THEY CONFIRM IT'S A CASE OF SABOTAGE WITHIN THEIR OWN RANKS. IMPACT POINT IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE AT ABOUT 200 MILES OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST. - AND THE NUCLEAR REACTOR? - IT WILL REACH CRITICAL MASS SHORTLY AFTER IMPACT. UNLESS IT IS DEACTIVATED IN TIME, THE DETONATION COULD DESTROY SAN FRANCISCO AND KILL A MILLION PEOPLE. MR. PRESIDENT, OUR NEW G-A MISSILES COULD KNOCK IT OUT... WHEN IT ENTERED THE STRATOSPHERE. THE A.E.C. HAS ALREADY RULED THAT OUT BECAUSE OF LETHAL FALLOUT. THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY OF FULL-SCALE EVACUATION. NO, GEORGE. THE TIME ELEMENT MAKES THAT OUT OF THE QUESTION. DEACTIVATION OF THE SATELLITE AFTER IT FALLS INTO THE OCEAN IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION. THAT'S WHY THE RUSSIANS ARE SENDING US TWO OF THEIR TOP MISSILE TECHNICIANS. - ARE THEY ABOARD THE SEAVIEW YET? - ONE HAS BEEN PICKED UP AT SEA. THE OTHER ONE IS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO LOS ANGELES BY JET. GENTLEMEN, I'M NOW DETERMINED TO FOLLOW THE ONLY PLAN WHICH CAN FORESTALL A MAJOR DISASTER... PERHAPS EVEN A NUCLEAR WAR. I'VE ORDERED ADMIRAL NELSON AND HIS SUBMARINE SEAVIEW... TO GET TO THE SATELLITE AS SOON AS IT FALLS, AND TO ASSIST THE RUSSIAN TECHNICIANS IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE... TO RENDER HARMLESS THIS THREAT TO THE LIVES OF... MILLIONS OF OUR CITIZENS. [Russian] [Chattering] MR. GRONSKI, WE'RE TO TAKE YOU TO THE HELICOPTER. IT'S WAITING. [Russian] [Groaning] [Crane] ADMIRAL, THIS IS MR. GRONSKI. ADMIRAL NELSON. WELCOME ABOARD. THANK YOU, ADMIRAL. I WISH IT COULD BE UNDER HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES. SO DO I. WE'VE JUST RECEIVED OUR FINAL ORDERS FROM WASHINGTON. WE ARE TO RACE NORTH TO THE PREDICTED SPLASH AREA AT ONCE. OH. YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER? NO, WE HAVE NEVER MET. AN HONOR, COMRADE GRONSKI. I AM GREGORY MALINOFF. OH, YES. I HAVE HEARD EXCELLENT REPORTS OF YOUR WORK. THANK YOU. I'LL HAVE YOU SHOWN TO YOUR QUARTERS, MR. GRONSKI. THEN I'D LIKE TO BRIEF YOU ON THE SITUATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. KOWALSKI, SHOW MR. GRONSKI TO HIS QUARTERS. AYE, SIR. FOLLOW ME, PLEASE. MALINOFF... [Russian] [Russian] NOT MUCH DOUBT WHICH ONE'S THE BOSS, IS THERE? THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM, LEE. OURS IS TO GET THEM TO THE SPLASH AREA IN TIME. LET'S GET UNDER WAY. AYE, SIR. MR. MORTON, PREPARE TO GET UNDER WAY. ADMIRAL, THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE FINISHED THEIR COMPUTATIONS. THEY'D LIKE TO COMPARE NOTES. WE'VE BEEN NOTIFIED OF A CHANGE. THE SATELLITE HAS VEERED FROM ITS PREDICTED COURSE. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR FURTHER WORD. 11.4. THAT WOULD BE SERIOUS. HAS THIS BEEN VERIFIED BY ANY OF OUR TRACKING STATIONS? THE FIRST REPORT CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE KREMLIN. WE'RE DOUBLE-CHECKING WITH OUR TRACKING STATIONS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. 11.4. THAT WOULD BRING THE SATELLITE MUCH CLOSER TO THE COAST. THAT'S RIGHT. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW... I'M HAVING SOME DATA PROCESSED BY OUR COMPUTER. ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT FOR IT. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR BOAT, GENTLEMEN? WE ARE VERY IMPRESSED BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN, AND, UH, PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSED BY WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN. WHEN WE, UH, REACH THE SATELLITE, IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO SWIM OUT TO IT, WILL IT NOT? I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY FOR YOU TO REACH IT. IT WILL BE A SIMPLE MATTER, COMRADE. FOR AN EXPERT, PERHAPS. YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT? I AM A SPACE EXPERT, COMRADE. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT DIVING. [Russian] [Continues In Russian] WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THIS MISSION. - WE MUST ABANDON THE PLAN. - WE CAN'T! IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE. AS LONG AS MR. MALINOFF KNOWS HOW TO SWIM, WE CAN TEACH HIM HOW TO HANDLE SCUBA GEAR. I'LL ASSIGN A MAN TO IT IMMEDIATELY. [Man On Speaker] ADMIRAL, IT'S WASHINGTON, SIR. CODE LINE 13. SEA LION. CODE 13 UNSCRAMBLED. READY NOW, SIR. YES, MR. PRESIDENT? WE'VE JUST RECEIVED FURTHER DATA OVER THE HOT LINE. THE COURSE IS NOW 11.5. FIVE? IS THAT A VERIFIED COURSE, SIR? MR. PRESIDENT, HOLD JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE. I JUST HAVE SOME FIGURES FROM MY COMPUTER. CHARTS, QUICKLY! MR. PRESIDENT... ARE YOU SURE OF THAT? ABSOLUTELY. 11.5, CORRELATED WITH OUR DATA, BRINGS THE SATELLITE TO LESS THAN 50 MILES FROM SAN FRANCISCO... AND AT LEAST TWO HOURS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. I'M TELLING YOU GUYS. THIS IS NO SCUTTLEBUTT. THOSE RUSSIANS ARE ABOARD BECAUSE ONE OF THEIR ROCKETS GOOFED. [Men Laughing] OKAY, OKAY, LAUGH IT UP, BUT YOU'RE LIABLE TO FIND YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LOUDEST BANG YOU EVER HEARD. I HEAR IT'S LOADED WITH ATOM BOMBS, AND IT'S GONNA LAND SMACK ON TOP OF SAN FRANCISCO. OKAY, OKAY, YOU GUYS. BREAK IT UP. BACK TO WORK. OH, SKIPPER? YES, CLARK? CAPTAIN, I'D LIKE PERMISSION TO SEND A RADIO MESSAGE. I'M SORRY. RADIO'S SECURED TO ALL PERSONNEL UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. BUT, CAPTAIN, I GOTTA SEND WORD TO MY WIFE. WHAT WORD? SIR, MY WIFE AND MY KID ARE IN SAN FRANCISCO. IF THE SCUTTLEBUTT ABOUT THE BOMB IS TRUE, I WANT 'EM OUTTA THERE. SORRY, CLARK. NO MESSAGES. INITIAL PERIGEE, 178 MILES. INITIAL APOGEE, 1,368 MILES. ORBITAL TIME, 110 MINUTES. INCLINATION OF FINAL ORBIT, 62 DEGREES. EXCUSE ME, ADMIRAL. YOU SAY THE FINAL ORBIT IS 62 DEGREES? THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. [Russian] HE'S RIGHT. THE FIGURES DON'T MAKE SENSE. UNLESS THE MECHANISM WAS TAMPERED WITH. THE SATELLITE MECHANISM WAS TAMPERED WITH. WHAT? THAT'S A VERY BAD THING FOR YOU TO SAY, ADMIRAL. THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE SOVIET UNION HAS JUST REVEALED THAT IT WAS SABOTAGE. WHAT WERE YOU TOLD? ONLY THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN ACCIDENT. A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT THAT WE WERE TO REPAIR TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES. BUT NOT SABOTAGE. WE'RE WASTING TIME. INCLINATION AT POINT OF IMPACT, 81 DEGREES, AND THAT'S IT. [Russian] [Russian Continues] THE SATELLITE WILL REACH CRITICAL MASS IN FIVE HOURS. FIVE HOURS? A FEW MINUTES, MORE OR LESS, BUT FIVE HOURS. AND HOW LONG TO DISARM IT? TWO AND A HALF HOURS. COMRADE MALINOFF THINKS IT CAN BE DONE IN LESS, BUT I PREFER TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE. THAT'LL TAKE US AT LEAST THREE HOURS TO GET THERE, TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO DISARM IT. THAT'S FIVE AND HALF HOURS, AND IT'S SET TO GO OFF IN FIVE HOURS. - YOU SEE, IT CANNOT BE DONE. - WE NEED 30 MINUTES. MR. MALINOFF, YOU THOUGHT THE SATELLITE COULD BE DISARMED IN LESS THAN TWO AND A HALF HOURS. - HOW MUCH LESS? - FIVE MINUTES, MAYBE 10. BUT WITH THESE FIGURES, I DON'T SEE HOW. REACTOR ROOM STATION, CUT IN FULL EMERGENCY POWER ON ALL BANKS. [Man] WHAT ABOUT OUR SAFETY MARGINS, SIR? FORGET THEM! THIS IS AS FAR AS WE'VE EVER PUSHED IT AND THEN SOME. WE'RE GONNA PUSH HER A LITTLE HARDER. AYE, SIR. WE'LL GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU'D BETTER TELL THE CREW. I AGREE. AND KEEP HER AT FLANK SPEED ALL THE WAY. AYE, SIR. NOW HEAR THIS. THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. ON THIS DAY, MAY 27, 1973, A RUSSIAN SATELLITE, OUT OF CONTROL, IS EXPECTED TO LAND IN THE PACIFIC SOMEWHERE... CLOSE TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. WE ARE NOW RUNNING AT FLANK SPEED... TOWARD THE ANTICIPATED SPLASH POINT. OUR MISSION IS TO REACH THE SATELLITE... AND DISARM ITS NUCLEAR PILE BEFORE IT DETONATES... WITH A FORCE THAT COULD DESTROY SAN FRANCISCO. WE ARE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. OTHER THAN THAT, WE WILL MAINTAIN RADIO SILENCE... FOR THE DURATION OF THE MISSION. YOU HEAR THAT? MY WIFE AND MY KIDS ARE IN SAN FRANCISCO. - HE WON'T LET ME SEND A MESSAGE. - DRY UP, CLARK. - WHO SAID THAT? - I DID. WE ALL HAVE TO SWEAT THIS OUT. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL? - SHUT UP, KOWALSKI! - [Scoffs] YOU JUST HAVEN'T GOT THE GUTS TO TAKE IT. [Mutters] HEY! HEY! [Men Shouting] ATTENTION! ALL RIGHT. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS? KOWALSKI? FOR WHAT, SIR? THIS ISN'T A PLEASURE CRUISE WE'RE ON. IF THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN, SOME HEADS WILL ROLL. I HOPE THAT'S CLEAR. ANY MOMENT NOW. UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER CHANGE. WELL, LET'S GET BELOW. LEE, TAKE HER DOWN. AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE, ADMIRAL! AT THIS RATE, THERE MAY EVEN BE TIME TO SPARE. WE CAN GET YOU THERE, MR. GRONSKI. AFTER THAT, WE'RE IN YOUR HANDS. JUST IMAGINE, A FEW MILES FROM HERE, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, THERE IS A MACHINE TICKING AWAY THE SECONDS... THAT COULD DECIDE THE FUTURE OF MANKIND. AND, BY A QUIRK OF FATE, IT ALL RESTS IN OUR HANDS. DOESN'T THAT STRIKE YOUR SENSE OF THE DRAMATIC, ADMIRAL? IT STRIKES MY SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. I CAN'T THINK BEYOND THAT. THEY SAY THAT EVERYONE WAS PUT HERE ON EARTH FOR A PURPOSE. PERHAPS THIS IS OUR ORDAINED PURPOSE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A RELIGIOUS MAN, MR. GRONSKI. I AM NOT. AND I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT RELIGION. I AM TALKING ABOUT DESTINY. COULD THEY BE THE SAME? EVERY MAN TO HIS OWN INTERPRETATION. YOU STAY WITH YOURS, ADMIRAL. I WILL STAY WITH MINE. [Crane On Speaker] ADMIRAL, WE'RE ENTERING THE TARGET AREA. VERY WELL. BY THE WAY, ADMIRAL, I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE MECHANISM IN THE SATELLITE. I MAY HAVE A WAY OF DISARMING IT IN MUCH LESS TIME THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE. IT IS SOMETHING, COMRADE, THAT I CAN SHOW YOU WHEN WE OPEN THE CAPSULE. SOMETHING KNOWN ONLY TO THOSE WHO WORKED ON IT. A NEW DEVELOPMENT. GOOD. [Crane On Speaker] ADMIRAL, THE MAGNETOMETER SHOWS METAL CONTACT. - IT COULD BE THE CAPSULE. - I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. COME. WE WILL GET INTO OUR DIVING EQUIPMENT AT ONCE. COME. THERE SHE IS, SIR. I FIGURE HER AT A LITTLE LESS THAN 8,000 YARDS. TAKE HER ANOTHER 4,000 YARDS, THEN START REDUCE SPEED. AYE, SIR. REDUCE SPEED TO ONE-THIRD. SLOW TO ONE-THIRD. SPARKS, YOU GOTTA SEND A MESSAGE FOR ME. BEAT IT, CLARK. I'M BUSY. I GOTTA GET IT OUT. IF YOU DON'T DO IT, I'LL SEND IT MYSELF! COME ON! GET OUTTA THERE, SPARKS! CHIEF! WAIT! HE JUMPED SPARKS. HE MUST'VE BLOWN HIS CORK. YOU OKAY, SPARKS? YEAH, I GUESS SO. WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? I'LL PUT HIM IN THE BRIG. NO, HOLD IT! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, CLARK? YOU GOT THE WORD. YOU KNOW WE'RE ON RADIO SILENCE. I COULDN'T HELP IT. I... I HAVE TO WARN MY WIFE. SHE AND THE KID... IF THAT BOMB GOES OFF... KNOCK IT OFF! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA... WHAT A MESSAGE ABOUT THIS BOMB WOULD DO TO THE WHOLE BAY AREA? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU. ONE WORD LEAKED OUT... COULD START A PANIC THAT WOULD KILL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. JUST MY WIFE, SKIPPER. I JUST WANTED TO WARN MY WIFE. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE WOULDN'T BE KILLED IN THE PANIC TOO? YES, AND YOUR KID? I JUST WANNA GIVE 'EM A FIGHTING CHANCE! THEY'RE RIGHT IN THE TARGET AREA! WE'RE ALL IN THE TARGET AREA! ANOTHER STUNT LIKE THIS, AND I'LL HAVE YOU THROWN IN THE BRIG. NOW GET TO YOUR POST. AYE, AYE, SIR. A LOT OF GUYS GOT FAMILIES IN THE BAY AREA, CAPTAIN. I KNOW. POST AN ARMED GUARD HERE. PASS THE WORD THE RADIO SHACK IS OFF-LIMITS. OKAY. CARRY ON, CHIEF. YES, SIR. [Man On Speaker] CLOSING IN. READING POINT, FOUR. HOLDING POINT, THREE. STEADY AT ONE-THIRD. POINT THREE HOLDING. POINT TWO. CURLEY, ALL SET? ALL SET, SIR. THE CAPSULE'S AT NEARLY 400 FEET. HAVE YOU EVER DIVED TO THAT LEVEL? OH, YES. MANY TIMES. - YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? - I HOPE I CAN. - I HAVE HAD EXPERT INSTRUCTION. - VERY WELL. WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU. - IF YOU THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED, JUST ASK FOR IT. - GOOD. [Man On Speaker] POINT TWO HOLDING. POINT ONE. CAPSULE SIGHTED. MARK POINT ONE. WE'RE HERE, GENTLEMEN. YOU HAVE TWO HOURS AND 35 MINUTES. NO LONGER. WE UNDERSTAND. SPARKS, CODE 13. UNSCRAMBLE TO WASHINGTON. KEEP IT OPEN. AYE, SIR. [Malinoff On Speaker] TO SEAVIEW. THE CAPSULE HAS SETTLED ON THE ACCESS HATCH. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT IT OPEN. THAT'S DANGEROUS. THE TORCH MIGHT TRIGGER IT. [Sparks On Speaker] CODE THREE. SEA LION. UNSCRAMBLED AND READY, SIR. - NELSON SPEAKING. - YES, ADMIRAL? JUST A MOMENT. THE SEAVIEW HAS REACHED THE CAPSULE, AND THE MEN ARE WORKING ON IT. ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATIONS, GRONSKI AND MALINOFF... HAVE A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO HOURS AND 25 MINUTES TO DISARM THE CAPSULE. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING OUT THERE FOR FIVE MINUTES. THEY HAVE TO BE FINISHED BY 0245. THEY'VE ASSURED ME THAT IT CAN BE DONE. WE'LL KEEP YOU ADVISED OF ALL DEVELOPMENTS, SIR. [Malinoff] TO SEAVIEW. WE HAVE CUT THROUGH. [Men Speaking Russian] [Russian Continues] THE MEN ARE AT THE CAPSULE NOW. WE'LL INFORM YOU THE MOMENT THEY'RE FINISHED. [Russian Continues] WHAT'S TAKING THEM SO LONG? THERE'S STILL TIME... IF NOTHING GOES WRONG. THAT'S WHAT HAUNTS ME, LEE. MALINOFF'S AN AMATEUR UNDERWATER. CURLEY SAYS THE MAN'S A GOOD SWIMMER. HE'LL BE OKAY... IF HE DOESN'T HAVE TROUBLE CLEARING HIS MASK. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? AS YOU KNOW, IT'S A TRICKY THING FOR A BEGINNER TO MASTER. HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT ALL THROUGH THE LESSONS. WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? WELL, IT'S TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW. ALL WE CAN DO IS SWEAT IT OUT. FORTY-ONE MINUTES TO GO. [Malinoff On Speaker] TO SEAVIEW. WE HAVE FINISHED. WE ARE COMING IN. HE IS HURT. IS IT THE BENDS? NO. NO, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE. CAPTAIN, THEY'RE BACK. THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES AHEAD OF SCHEDULE! WELCOME THEM FOR ME. I'M CALLING THE PRESIDENT. [Sparks On Speaker] CODE 13. SEA LION. SCRAMBLED. CODE 13. SEA LION. UNSCRAMBLE. HE MUST'VE HEARD ME. YES, MR. PRESIDENT. I WAS JUST GOING TO CALL... I SEE. FROM MOSCOW. I UNDERSTAND. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. I... I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN. THEY JUST HEARD FROM THE KREMLIN. RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE HAS JUST CAPTURED ONE OF THE RINGLEADERS OF THE SABOTAGE PLOT. THEY NOW HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ONE OF OUR RUSSIAN TECHNICIANS IS AN IMPOSTOR. WHICH ONE? THEY DON'T KNOW. THE PRISONER DIED BEFORE THEY COULD GET A FULL STATEMENT. [Crane] THE SATELLITE HASN'T BEEN DISARMED. IT'S STILL GONNA BLOW UP. THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY PURPOSE IN SENDING AN IMPOSTOR. [Crane] WE'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? MMM. GET GRONSKI AND MALINOFF DOWN HERE, BUT DON'T LET THEM THINK ANYTHING'S WRONG. IT WON'T BE EASY. SPARKS, IT'S THE ADMIRAL. IN FIVE MINUTES, CALL ME ON THE INTERCOM. TELL ME I HAVE A CODE 13 SEA LION CALL FROM WASHINGTON. WHEN I PICK UP THE PHONE, DISREGARD ANYTHING I SAY... AND HAVE THE MASTER AT ARMS STAND BY. WELCOME BACK, AND CONGRATULATIONS. A JOB WELL DONE. THANK YOU, SIR. FOR A NOVICE UNDERWATER, COMRADE MALINOFF DID VERY WELL. [Laughs] I WOULD NOT LIKE TO TRY IT AGAIN. I'VE JUST TALKED WITH WASHINGTON. I'M SURE THE KREMLIN HAS THE GOOD NEWS BY NOW. WELL, THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN? THANK YOU. LEE, I'LL LEAVE THE POURING UP TO YOU. YOU DO THAT BETTER THAN I DO. AS YOU SAY, I WILL TAKE MINE NEAT. WELL, IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO HERE, ADMIRAL, I HAVE TO GET BACK TO MOSCOW AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE'RE SENDING A BUOY UP TO MARK THE CAPSULE. - IT'LL JUST BE A FEW MINUTES. - HERE WE ARE. MR. GRONSKI. THANK YOU. [Sparks On Speaker] ADMIRAL, IT'S WASHINGTON, SIR. CODE 13. SEA LION. UNSCRAMBLED AND READY, SIR. THANK YOU. NELSON SPEAKING. YES, MR. PRESIDENT. NO, WE ARE STILL IN THE AREA. YES. OF COURSE IT WOULDN'T BE ANY TROUBLE. YES, I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY. IT'LL BE PICKED UP IN SANTA BARBARA. YES, SIR, I'LL REPORT UPON ARRIVAL. SPARKS? AYE, SIR. INFORM MR. MORTON TO SECURE THE NAVIGATIONAL WATCH. WE'LL BE AROUND HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE YET. AYE, SIR. WASHINGTON HAS A REQUEST FROM YOUR GOVERNMENT. THEY WANT US TO SALVAGE THE ELECTRONIC BRAIN IN THE CAPSULE. SALVAGE THE BRAIN? IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. A MOST REMARKABLE DEVICE. THERE'S NO HURRY. WE'VE EARNED OURSELVES A REST. WE'LL WAIT UNTIL MORNING. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN AN HOUR OR SO. WE CAN GET STARTED ABOUT 0700. BUT THE BRAIN HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED. IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS! OUR GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE GOOD REASON FOR NOT WANTING TO LEAVE IT HERE... BEFORE WE CAN SALVAGE THE CAPSULE. MR. GRONSKI, YOU SEEM TO BE UPSET. WHAT IS IT, COMRADE? YOU ARE NOT FEELING WELL? SHUT UP. SHUT UP! AND GET AWAY FROM ME! MR. GRONSKI, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT FEELING WELL. - I WOULD SUGGEST YOU LIE DOWN. - YES, OR MAYBE WE'D BETTER CALL A DOCTOR. NO! THE KREMLIN IS WRONG. THERE IS NO POINT IN SAVING IT. ABSOLUTELY NO POINT. CAN'T YOU SEE? CAN'T YOU SEE? WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM HERE. WE HAVE TO GET AWAY! THE SATELLITE WAS NOT DISARMED. IT WILL GO OFF IN A FEW MINUTES. WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM HERE, OR WE WILL ALL BE BLOWN TO BITS! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I SAW YOU DISARM IT! NO. WHEN YOU STARTED BACK, I RECAPPED THE FUSE AND CONNECTED THE WIRES. IT WILL GO OFF! WHICH FUSE WAS RECAPPED? POINT IT OUT TO ME, QUICK! NO! GET MY WET SUIT READY. PREPARE THE EQUIPMENT. GET THE SUBMARINE STARTED! WE CAN'T GET AWAY IN TIME! ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS DISARM IT. NOW, WHICH FUSE? POINT IT OUT! - IT MUST BE THAT ONE. - NO, NOT THERE! HERE, WHERE THE WIRES CROSSED IN THE MAGNETIC LINE. I SWITCHED THEM. - ADMIRAL, CAN I HELP? - YOU WOULDN'T SURVIVE. MASTER AT ARMS, COME IN NOW! BUT IT'S TOO LATE! WE HAVE TO GET AWAY! IT'S TOO LATE! KEEP THIS MAN UNDER CLOSE SURVEILLANCE! IT'S TOO LATE! HE WON'T HAVE TIME IN 10 MINUTES! IT'S TOO LATE! IT'S TOO LATE! IT'S TOO LATE! [On Speaker] CAPTAIN CRANE, CODE 13. SEA LION. YES, SIR. THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. THE IMPOSTOR'S BEEN DISCOVERED AND IS UNDER DETENTION. YES, SIR. ADMIRAL NELSON'S AT THE CAPSULE NOW ATTEMPTING TO DISARM IT. WE'LL KEEP AN OPEN LINE AND REPORT THE MOMENT THERE'S FURTHER WORD. YES, SIR. [Nelson] I'VE GOT A SHORT HERE. TROUBLE. HE'S ACTIVATED THE CIRCUITS AND SHORTED THEM! IT COULD TRIGGER THE WHOLE MECHANISM! IT'S TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW! - [Nelson] I FOUND THE SHORT. - THERE IS NO CHANCE! ONLY ONE MINUTE LEFT! LESS THAN ONE MINUTE. [Nelson On Speaker] LEE, I'M COMING BACK. NOW HEAR THIS, ALL HANDS. THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. I'M ABOUT TO MAKE A REPORT ON THE DIRECT LINE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I WANT YOU ALL TO HEAR IT. MR. PRESIDENT, THE SATELLITE HAS BEEN DISARMED. GENTLEMEN, THE MISSILE HAS BEEN DISARMED. OH, WONDERFUL! CONGRATULATIONS! [Chattering] [Relieved Sigh] THIS CHAMPAGNE... I LIKE IT BETTER THAN VODKA. THAT'S QUITE AN ADMISSION COMING FROM YOU. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT YOU PERMITTED YOURSELF TOO MANY LUXURIES ABOARD THIS SHIP, BUT NOW I AM BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE THEM. AH, BETTER BE CAREFUL. [All Laugh] WHY SHOULD I BE CAREFUL? WHO CAN HEAR ME? TO OUR HOMES, GENTLEMEN, WHEREVER THEY ARE.
