YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THIS WITHOUT LOUSING IT UP? LISTEN, HARKER... EASY, BLAKE! EASY! GET OFF THE KID'S BACK, HARKER. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT CRACK. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY IT. COME ON! COME ON, BOTH OF YOU! KNOCK IT OFF! [Muttering] [Gasps] [Footsteps] [Coughs] I WONDER IF THE AIR PURIFIER QUIT ALONG WITH THE LIGHTS. FIND OUT. [Coughing] GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT, SIR. CAN WE GET OUT? WE'VE GOT ONE CHANCE. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD ONE. OUR POSITION IS KNOWN. WE'RE NOT FAR OUT OF NEW LONDON. WHEN THE RADIO QUIT, THE COAST GUARD MUST HAVE STARTED A SEARCH FOR US. THEY CAN'T FAIL TO SEE OUR MARKER BUOY. SUPPOSE THE COAST GUARD DON'T FIND US? SUPPOSE YOU'RE CROSSING A STREET IN LOS ANGELES ABOUT A MONTH FROM NOW AND A CAR HITS YOU. YES OR NO? IT'S BADLY DAMAGED. BEYOND REPAIR. MEN, WE'RE GONNA BE SHORT OF AIR FOR AWHILE, BUT NOT FOR LONG. MR. MORTON AND CHIEF JONES ARE IN NEW LONDON, WHERE OUR DIVING BELL HAS JUST BEEN OVERHAULED. AS SOON AS THEY GET WORD, THEY CAN REACH US WITH PLENTY OF AIR... IN A MATTER OF HOURS. YOU'LL HAVE ALL THE AIR YOU NEED AS SOON AS THE DIVING BELL GETS HERE. SO JUST SIT TIGHT, AND WE'LL ALL MAKE IT. HOW LONG CAN WE HOLD OUT WITHOUT AIR? WELL, THERE'S RESIDUAL AIR IN ALL UNFLOODED COMPARTMENTS, AND ADD TO THAT THE OXYGEN WE CAN BLEED OFF AT INTERVALS. MY GUESS IS THAT WE CAN HOLD OUT FOR ABOUT, UH... ABOUT 10 HOURS. [Vehicle Approaching] THEY FOUND 'EM 12 MILES OUT. SHAKE IT UP, CURLEY. BUT WE CAN'T FIND THE SHORT IN THE GUIDANCE CONTROL SYSTEM. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? AT LEAST TWO DAYS. [Man] EASY, EASY. OKAY, LOWER. EASY. EASY. ALL RIGHT. GET THAT PLATE OFF. [Ringing] - SEAVIEW. - ADMIRAL, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? AM I GLAD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. NOW, LISTEN CAREFULLY, CHIP. JUST REACHING US THROUGH THE MINES WILL BE TOUGH ENOUGH. THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO COUPLE THE BELL TO OUR HULL. IT CAN'T BE DONE IF OUR ANGLE OF LIST IS MORE THAN 30 DEGREES. SIR, THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON THE BELL IN NEW LONDON. H-HOW MUCH LONGER? CURLEY'S STAYING CLOSE TO IT. IF THEY DON'T FIND THAT SHORT BY THE TIME I GET BACK, WE'LL BRING THE BELL OUT HERE AND ATTEMPT A RESCUE BY CONTROLLED DESCENT. ALL RIGHT, CHIP. WE'LL SWEAT IT OUT. THIS IS GONNA TAKE LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT. BUT IF WE CONSERVE EVERY BIT OF AIR IN THE BOAT, WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. [Baines On Speaker] ADMIRAL, THIS IS SICK BAY. GO AHEAD, DOC. CAN YOU COME BACK HERE, SIR? RIGHT AWAY. CONSERVE AIR. STOP BREATHING. WHAT'S WRONG? HE'S ALL RIGHT. A FRACTURED LEG. I GAVE HIM A SEDATIVE. BUT BISHOP OVER HERE... HE'S IN CRITICAL CONDITION. [Moaning] CONCUSSION, POSSIBLE SKULL FRACTURE. OH, CRAZY KID. ADMIRAL... ADMIRAL, SIR, I'M THE EXEC... I HAD TO TELL HIM, SIR. EASY, BISHOP. TAKE IT EASY. IF WE HOPE TO SAVE BISHOP, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE HIM OUR BOTTLED OXYGEN. OXYGEN? WE CUT EVERYBODY'S TIME A LITTLE OF A FRACTION. IF THERE'S ONLY A FRACTION BETWEEN LIVING AND DYING, THEN IT'S NOT A LITTLE. IT'S EVERYTHING. HE WON'T LAST ANOTHER TWO HOURS WITHOUT OXYGEN. YOU WANT ME TO RISK THE LIVES OF EVERY MAN IN THIS SHIP IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS? EITHER WE GIVE BISHOP ALL THE OXYGEN HE NEEDS, OR WE LET HIM DIE. THAT'S UP TO YOU. I CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION. YOU CAN GIVE BISHOP HIS OWN SHARE OF THE OXYGEN, AND YOU CAN GIVE HIM MINE, BUT THE REST BELONGS TO THE MEN. I'LL TAKE A VOTE, STARTING WITH YOU, DOC. YES, OF COURSE. [Sighs] COME ON, BLAKE. SNAP OUT OF IT. BLAKE! IT'S MY FAULT ALL THOSE GUYS ARE DEAD. COME ON. IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT. YEAH, IT IS. I DID IT. THAT'S JUST THE WAY I SEE IT. YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, HARKER. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, EVANS? YOU TRYING TO DEFEND HIM BECAUSE HE TRIED TO DEFEND YOU? MAYBE I AM. KNOCK IT OFF, YOU GUYS. I SAW THE WHOLE THING. IF YOU ASK ME, IT WAS BISHOP'S FAULT. YEAH, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOAT, PICK THAT DUTY-STRUCK GOLD BRAID. LEAVE BLAKE ALONE, OR I'LL BUST YA. YOU'LL WHAT? YOU HEARD ME. I'LL BUST YA! OH, SIT DOWN, JUNIOR. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. EVANS, HARKER, THAT'S ENOUGH. SAVE IT TILL WE GET OUT OF HERE. SIT DOWN. I CAME HERE TO PUT A PROPOSITION TO YOU. WE HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF RESERVE OXYGEN. IT MAY MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. IN A SENSE, EACH MAN OWNS A SHARE OF IT. FIRST, LET ME SAY THAT LT. BISHOP IS IN BAD SHAPE. WITHOUT OXYGEN... EXTRA OXYGEN... HE'LL DIE. DR. BAINES WANTED ME TO AUTHORIZE ITS USE, BUT I WANT YOU MEN TO DECIDE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR BISHOP, MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS FIX. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS IN MY BOOK, SIR. BLAKE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD IT'LL DO HIM. HE CAN HAVE MINE. MINE TOO, I GUESS. YEAH. I GUESS I'M KIND OF A SELFISH GUY, ADMIRAL. THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT, IF WE EVER GET LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF THIS THING, I'D LIKE TO LOOK BISHOP IN THE FACE. AND IF WE DON'T GET OUT OF IT, IT WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE, WOULD IT? SO, UH, YOU CAN HAVE MINE. [Sighs] I GUESS I'LL CHANGE MY VOTE TOO, SIR. WE MIGHT AS WELL MAKE IT UNANIMOUS. ALL RIGHT, MEN. THANKS. O'BRIEN? YES, SIR. COLLINS? DOC, WE'VE JUST TAKEN THE VOTE OF THE MEN. BISHOP GETS HIS OXYGEN. CURLEY? YES, SIR. ANY LUCK? NO, SIR. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS BELL TO THEM. THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. - CAN'T WE TAKE IT THE WAY IT IS? - NO, THEY'RE IN A MINEFIELD. TRYING TO GET THROUGH WITHOUT A GUIDANCE SYSTEM WOULD BE SUICIDE. KEEP PUSHING THE MEN. THIS IS THE ONLY BELL ON THIS COAST THAT CAN GO THAT DEEP. [Klaxon Blares] [On Speaker] MISSILE STORAGE ROOM. PATTERSON SPEAKING. FIRE IN THE AUXILIARY WIRING SYSTEM. HARKER, GIVE ME A HAND! GIVE HIM A HAND. MISSILE ROOM, STAND FAST. HELP ON THE WAY. THE FIRE'S BROKEN OUT BACK HERE! QUICK, GET SOME OVER HERE. [Coughing] THE FIRE'S DEEP IN THE WIRING SYSTEM, SIR. HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED IT YET. WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT. RIP OUT ALL THE WIRING IF YOU HAVE TO. THE LONGER IT BURNS, THE MORE OXYGEN IT CONSUMES. AYE, AYE, SIR. STICK WITH THE FIRE DETAIL. I'LL CHECK THE CORRIDOR AFT. IF IT BREAKS THROUGH THERE, WE'RE FINISHED. YES, SIR. [Crackling] [Coughing] MR. O'BRIEN, GET THE RELIEF MEN AFT. AYE, AYE, SIR. NOW HEAR THIS. RELIEF FIRE DETAIL, LAY AFT, ON THE DOUBLE. [Gasping] O'BRIEN. HELP! RESERVE OXYGEN! COME ON, COME ON. COME ON. [Groans] MAKE ROOM HERE. GIVE ME SOME ROOM! COME ON! HOW MUCH? JUST ENOUGH TO BRING HIM AROUND. [Coughing, Gagging] OKAY. HE ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. I-I'LL BE ALL RIGHT, SIR. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. SAVE YOUR BREATH. SAVE YOUR BREATH. [Panting] SIT STILL. OKAY, OKAY. KOWALSKI, SPREAD THE REST OF THAT OXYGEN IN THE ROOM. THE AIR IS FOUL. AYE, SIR. THE WHOLE CONTAINER. BLAKE, I WANT YOU TO GET A CYLINDER. PUT IT IN EVERY UNFLOODED COMPARTMENT ON THE SHIP. COME ON. YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, SIR. I THINK I AM. I THINK YOU'RE OKAY. [Whispering] EVANS? EVANS. EVANS! WHAT? YOU WANNA GET OUT OF HERE? WANNA SEE THAT WIFE OF YOURS AGAIN? WE CAN GET OUT... WITH THESE. COLLINS, YOU'RE CRAZY. WE'RE TOO DEEP. HOW DO YOU KNOW? ANYBODY EVER TRIED AT THIS DEPTH? - I JUST GO BY WHAT THEY SAY. - YEAH, BUT IF THEY'RE WRONG, WE'RE GONNA DIE IN HERE. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE HER AGAIN, EVANS? MAYBE SEE THAT KID OF YOURS WHEN IT'S BORN? WHAT DO YOU SAY? GOT YOUR OWN SUPPLY OF OXYGEN, HUH, BLAKE? THAT'S WHAT I CALL INSURANCE. LISTEN, HARKER. JUST LET ME ALONE. [Chuckles] OH, BOY. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, YOU LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE FIRST, DON'T YA, HUH? HEY! [Rumbling, Crashing] [Rumbling, Crashing Stops] LOOKS LIKE WE SETTLED IN THE MUD. SHE'S BREAKIN' UP. THERE'S NOBODY GONNA GET OUT OF HERE NOW. NOBODY. ALL RIGHT, CURLEY. LET'S GO. DID YOU FIND IT? NO. GET THAT LIFT CRANE OVER HERE. WE'RE SHOVING OFF ANYWAY. BUT THE MINEFIELDS! WE'LL GET THROUGH IT SOMEHOW. COME ON! GET THAT LIFT CRANE! WE'RE WASTING TIME! YES, SIR! PUT THAT EQUIPMENT BACK IN. LET'S GO. [Exhales Loudly] OUR ANGLE'S UP TO 23 DEGREES. ANOTHER WALLOP LIKE THAT, AND THE BELL WON'T DO US ANY GOOD, EVEN IF IT GETS HERE. I'M GOING BACK AND TELL THE ADMIRAL. DO YOU FEEL WELL ENOUGH TO TAKE OVER HERE? YES, SIR. I'LL BE OKAY. IS THE ADMIRAL BACK THERE WITH THE FIRE? NO, SIR. I THOUGHT HE'D BE IN THE CONTROL ROOM BY NOW. HE NEVER CAME FORWARD. WHERE DID YOU SEE HIM LAST? HE WENT TO CHECK THE AFT CORRIDOR FOR FIRE, SIR. WHEN THE FIRE'S OUT, SEAL OFF THE ROOM AND COME FORWARD! ADMIRAL! [Shouts] COLLINS, I CAN'T DO IT. YOU WANT TO STAY DOWN HERE AND DIE? WE'VE STILL GOT A CHANCE. HOW DO YOUR LUNGS FEEL? WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF AIR. IF THEY DO GET TO US, THEY'LL FIND A SHIP FULL OF DEAD MEN. I'LL GO FIRST. NO! COLLINS, WAIT! YOU CAN'T DO IT... I'LL TALK TO YOU THROUGH THE MIKE. WHEN YOU HEAR I'M OKAY, YOU FOLLOW. NO, COLLINS, YOU CAN'T DO IT. I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU, COLLINS! LET GO! HEY! NO, COL... COME ON. OKAY, PUT HIM DOWN HERE. THAT'S IT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GET SOME TOWELS, ANYTHING. YES, SIR. [Coughs] YOU ALL RIGHT? [Coughing] LEE... THE FIRE'S OUT. [Exhales Loudly] I'LL BE ALL RIGHT IN A MINUTE. HERE. A BLANKET, SIR. [Coughing] [Collins On Speaker] EVANS, I'M OUT NOW. IT'S REAL SAFE. EVANS. COME ON, EVANS. FOLLOW ME UP. IT'S A BREEZE. WHOSE VOICE WAS THAT? COLLINS, USING THE STEINKE HOOD. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE! I TRIED TO TELL HIM, SIR. COME ON, EVANS. FOLLOW ME UP. YOU CAN... YOU CAN... [Strained] EVANS, HELP ME. HELP ME! HELP ME. [Gasping] HELP ME! YOU CAN CHALK UP ANOTHER ONE FOR BLAKE. THAT'S ENOUGH, HARKER. FIRST O'MARA, THE REST OF 'EM, AND NOW COLLINS. THEY'D ALL BE ALIVE IF IT WASN'T FOR BLAKE. YOU'D BETTER GET SQUARED AWAY. THAT MAN DIDN'T PLANT THE MINEFIELD. - HE MADE A MISTAKE OF JUDGMENT. - A MISTAKE? THAT COST US A LOT, THAT MISTAKE! IT COST HIM TOO. HE HAS TO LIVE WITH IT. I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO GIVE HIM A BREAK. THINK ABOUT IT. ALL SECURE, CAPTAIN. THEN LET'S GO! YES, SIR! GOOD LUCK, COMMANDER. THANKS. READY ON THE WINCH. LOWER AWAY ON SIGNAL. ALL RIGHT. TAKE IT UP. [Nelson On Speaker] MEN, HEAR THIS. WE'VE JUST RECEIVED WORD FROM TOPSIDE. MR. MORTON HAS STARTED HIS DESCENT. OUR SURVIVAL STILL DEPENDS ON OUR BEING AS QUIET AS WE CAN. FROM NOW ON, ONLY ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY. DON'T MOVE AROUND THE SHIP. CONSERVE YOUR AIR. STAY CALM. IT'LL STILL BE A COUPLE OF HOURS. WE'RE ON THE DESCENT, ADMIRAL. HOW LONG CAN YOU HOLD OUT? NOT MUCH LONGER. YOU HAVE AIR? PLENTY OF IT. WHAT'S THE PRESENT ANGLE ON THE ESCAPE HATCH? IT'S 23 DEGREES. IT'S DIFFICULT, BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IF WE DON'T SETTLE AGAIN, WE CAN MAKE THE CONNECTION. BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THE MINEFIELDS, CHIP. IT'S GONNA BE TRICKY. YES, SIR. WE KNOW. BLAKE, THE BELL'S ON ITS WAY DOWN. COME ON. HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE, HUH? I'LL GET IT. [Sighs] SKIPPER, THE MINES! THEY'RE SHIFTING WITH THE CURRENT. SLOW THE DESCENT. AYE, AYE, SIR. SLOW THE DESCENT. WE'LL HAVE TO INCH OUR WAY THROUGH AND PRAY WE DON'T TOUCH ONE OF THEM. HARD LEFT. HARD LEFT. HARD LEFT! SHE'S NOT RESPONDING. FOUL CABLE! [Clamoring] IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT? THAT WAS THE BELL. IT HIT A MINE. HELLO, CHIP? DIVING BELL, COME IN. SALVAGE BARGE, CAN... CAN YOU HEAR ME? THE PHONE'S DEAD. I JUST CHECKED THE ANGLE. THIRTY-ONE DEGREES. THAT MEANS THE BELL CAN'T COUPLE WITH US. HELLO, SEAVIEW. HELLO, SEAVIEW. ADMIRAL! ADMIRAL! THE LINE'S DEAD. THE MINE DID IT. BUT WE'RE OVER THE SUB NOW. I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THAT. THE ANGLE'S TOO STEEP. - CAN WE MAKE A CONNECTION? - I DON'T KNOW, CURLEY. I DON'T KNOW. SO IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. WE NEED TO RIGHT OURSELVES AT LEAST FIVE DEGREES. BUT HOW? THE WHOLE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM'S BUSTED. WITHOUT BALLAST TANKS OR POWER, THERE'S NO WAY TO TURN THE SHIP. THERE'S ONE WAY... FLOOD A COMPARTMENT. YEAH. YEAH, THAT, UH... THAT WOULD BE THE COMPARTMENT. IF WE FLOOD 47, IT SHOULD BRING US ABOUT JUST TO THE RIGHT LIST. WHAT FOR? THE BELL'S GONE. THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE... NOBODY ALIVE. KOWALSKI, WE HAVE TO COUNT ON THAT BELL BEING THERE. I SAY FLOOD 47 NOW. IF WE OPEN A SEA COCK AT THIS DEPTH, THE WATER WILL COME IN LIKE A BATTERING RAM. BUT THE WATERTIGHT DOOR WOULD BE SHUT, SIR. THE WATER WOULD STAY IN THE COMPARTMENT. YEAH, SO WOULD THE MAN WHO OPENED THE VALVE. I CAN'T ASK ANY MAN TO DO THAT. HEY, BLAKE, I WANNA TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. BLAKE! - WHAT WAS BLAKE DOING UP HERE? - HE WASN'T HERE. I JUST SAW HIM IN THE CORRIDOR. I SPOKE TO HIM, LIKE YOU SAID, BUT IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD. HE'S IN BAD SHAPE. WHERE WAS HE GOING WHEN YOU PASSED HIM? I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS HEADING TOWARD ONE OF THE COMPARTMENTS... 47. BLAKE! BLAKE, ARE YOU IN THERE? BLAKE! [Knocking Continues] BLAKE, OPEN UP! BLAKE! BLAKE, WE'LL FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO RIGHT THE SHIP. BLAKE! [Knocking Continues] BLAKE, OPEN UP! [Crane] BLAKE! COME ON! BLAKE! BLAKE! A LITTLE LEFT. YES, SIR. HOLD IT! RIGHT, RIGHT. YES, SIR. HOLD IT THERE. STEADY. STEADY. WE MADE IT! [Door Opens] [Chattering, Laughing] PERMISSION TO COME ABOARD, SIR? HEY-HEY! HEY-HEY! I JUST CHECKED THE WHOLE LIST, ADMIRAL. WE SEEM TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL THAN WE HAVE ON SHORE LEAVE. EVERYONE ALL RIGHT, LEE? EVERYONE'S FINE. EVEN BISHOP'S OFF THE CRITICAL LIST. IN VIEW OF EVERYTHING, HE DOESN'T WANT TO PRESS ANY CHARGES AGAINST EVANS. GOOD. NEITHER DO I. BUT I HAVE SOME NEWS OF MY OWN. I JUST TALKED WITH CARVER AT THE BUREAU OF SHIPS. THE SEAVIEW? IS GOING TO BE RAISED. SHE'LL BE BACK IN COMMISSION IN SHORT ORDER. THAT'S A RELIEF. I'LL HAVE TO PASS THE WORD UP TO YOUNG HARRIMAN EVANS. - YOUNG WHO? - OH, DIDN'T I TELL YOU? MRS. EVANS HAD HER BABY... A BOY. SHE NAMED HIM AFTER YOU.
