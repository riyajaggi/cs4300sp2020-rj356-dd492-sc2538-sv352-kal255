   The most bitter pill to swallow is to suffer an unexpected defeat. {\an8}Realizing you are the loser in a war that you caused {\an8}and becoming aware that it has had the worst consequences {\an8}makes you lose your way. {\an8}No, don't leave me. {\an8}The thirst for revenge seems to have been left far behind, {\an8}and the mistakes you have made plague you without respite. {\an8}You only find an escape in those moments that once made you happy. {\an8}But it's only a mirage. {\an8}The truth is that you lost. You have to accept defeat. {\an8}But failures exist to teach human beings something they needed to learn. {\an8}Something they couldn't see before, that now becomes an undeniable truth. {\an8}Ms. Aguilar, this woman came to the hotel very upset, asking about you. {\an8}- Do you know her? - I'll take care of it. Thanks. {\an8}My daughter... Elisa. She's dead. She died in my arms. If you help me find Romero, I'll save your cable girls. I'll save the cable girls. Help me! A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Do you really think I'll accept something from you? That I'll believe you want to make a deal with the person who most despises you? {\an8}The hatred is mutual, darling, but I know you'll accept my offer {\an8}because you care too much about those girls. {\an8}Why don't you ask one of your men? {\an8}He was the person I trusted the most. {\an8}Romero and I have known each other for a long time. {\an8}When the Civil War broke out, I asked him to introduce Carlos into the fifth column, {\an8}and he's the one who brought you to the camp. I trusted him. {\an8}I thought he was my friend but he just wanted to use me. {\an8}He killed Carlos, and now he's done the same to Elisa. {\an8}The only reason I'm alive is because of my thirst for vengeance. {\an8}This swine... {\an8}You are the only swine here, madam. {\an8}You might have not pulled the trigger, Carmen, {\an8}but you're the only one responsible for their deaths. {\an8}I'll never {\an8}ever forget what you've done. {\an8}Especially because you're doing it to become rich in the most despicable way. {\an8}CHAPTER 41: DEFEAT {\an8}I don't know what you're talking about. {\an8}About you wanting to steal the prisoners' children, and then sell them as if they were livestock! Unbelievable... Do you realize you're playing with people's lives just to become a bit wealthier? That's disgusting. No, that's not true. All I wanted was to get money in order to get the company back. It's my family's only legacy. But what do I want it for now that my children are dead? I've been the worst mother in the world. My children had to die for me to become aware of it. No mother should outlive her children. Could we talk for a moment? In private. You're not thinking of accepting her offer, are you? Lidia, I've been very close to Elisa the last few years, and she never spoke well of her mother. - She told me she's dangerous, selfish... - I know their relationship was very odd. But she saved her life. That must mean something. She loved her somehow. Because she manipulated her all her life. - And she's doing the same to you now. - No, she never manipulated me. That's why she can't stand me. That's why she hated me so much. Look, I've known that woman for many years and I have never seen her so devastated. What's clear is that we won't be able to liberate that camp without her help. Well, then. And you think we can trust her? I didn't say we need to trust her in order to close the deal. We'll need your help. What are you thinking about? So? Have you made a decision? Yes. We're willing to accept your offer. But on one condition. You say you'd do anything for your daughter. That's right, but I'm afraid it's too late now. We know what her last wish before she died was. The truck that left her house yesterday was full of refugees. Elisa and I worked together, helping many people go into exile. That was her clandestine work against the regime. Why are you telling me this? Because Camila and Elisa's next step was to help me liberate all the women from your reeducation camp. To make amends for having helped lock up her friends in the camp. So, if you're suffering so much for your daughter's death, you'll help us. And we'll hand you Romero. You have my word. Carmen we know each other well enough to know your word is worth nothing at all. That's why I'll go with you, and make sure you do everything we ask you to do without lying. Do you accept the deal? Of course. Fine. Then you'll be coming with me to the camp. Comrades! This has only started. They're going to come back, - so we must stay united and strong! - Exactly. We'll fight together until the end. For our children, okay? - Yes? - Yes! Open up! I have a child with me. Open up! Come on! Martín? Martín? Where's Martín? Martín... Where is he? Let go of my son! He's just a kid. I want you to stop this riot right away, and I want all the people responsible for this to take a step forward. And I swear that if you don't, I won't hesitate to do it! Come on! - Baby! - No! - Stop, please! Stop! - Guards, let go of those women. It's an order! Let go of them! Mrs. Carmen, those women have set the children's building on fire, - they've organized a riot, and... - Who cares about that? I want this camp to be a model of peace and order between the prisoners and the authorities. There will be no peace if they take our children away. Nobody is taking your children away, I promise. - And why should we believe you? - Believe in the facts. New order: Mothers and children will stay together without any reprisals. If you follow my advice, everything will go back to normal, okay? Mrs. Carmen, at this stage, I believe these women deserve some punishment. Sometimes you need to know when to relax and when to put on the pressure, but right now, I don't think we should add fuel to the fire. We hope you honor your word and that this isn't one of your tricks. I don't like having to rely on Carmen at all. Well, let's trust that Camila will watch her, and we'll do our part of the deal in the meantime. Yes, but we're going to need a good plan. Did Carmen say anything that might help us? Anything about Romero? She said he goes to a clandestine casino a few times a week. I don't know. I thought we could sneak in play a couple of card games, and pour some narcotic in his drink. Yeah, but Romero knows us. - As soon as he sees us, it'll be over. - I could go. He doesn't know me. Besides, I'm pretty good at cards. Don't look at me like that. I've cleaned out a few people. There's a problem. It's a private club. Only for people close to the regime. What's the club's name? It's in the basement of a restaurant named "A Feira" or something. - A Feira. I don't know who could help us. - I do. I know someone who goes there often. Haven't I made it clear I don't want anyone to disturb me? - Do you really want to help release Marga? - Of course I do. Me being here doesn't mean I've forgiven you. What do you need? Are you still a member of the gambling club at A Feira? Yes, I am. We need you and Pablo to go there and drug this guy. Will you help us or not? - But there's a problem: Salgado. - Who is Salgado? - His contact, Pablo. - He's the one who I told where you were. He's a regular there. In fact, I went with him a few times. Imagine the fuss he'd kick up if he saw us together. I see, that was where you shared your little secrets, right? Pablo, please... Will he be there tonight? He always goes on Friday nights. He'll be there at ten o'clock. Could you arrange to meet him there shortly before ten? I could take care of him so that he doesn't see Pablo. They broke your arm? No, but they advised him to move his shoulder as little as possible. Martín and I wanted to thank you. You saved his life. It's okay. Martín was very brave. And we make a good team, don't we? Don't worry. He hasn't spoken since we got here. But I have never seen him so happy. Prisoners! I want to talk to you in the barracks. Now. Carmen said there would be no reprisals. There won't be any, don't worry. I'm here on behalf of Lidia. Carmen was forced to strike a deal with her. That's why she has forgiven you. - A deal with Carmen? - We have a plan to release you all. All of us? All of us, she says. Calm down, girls. If there's someone we can trust, it's Lidia. There's nothing to fear, really. I'm here to make sure that Carmen does things right. We'll go from here to France by train, and those who want will be able to board the Winnipeg to Chile. Obviously, those who don't will have other options. - Marga, are you okay? - No. They're getting more frequent and stronger every day. - We have to go to the infirmary now. - No. I don't want Carmen to take my baby away. There's no choice. The moment's arrived. Let's go. Marga, listen to her. - Let's see who's there. - Open the door, please. - The door! - What is going on here? She's about to give birth. - I'll call a doctor. - No, there's no time. I'm a doctor. Open up, please. - Don't go. - It'll be better at the infirmary. It's much safer. Okay, open up. Try to deliver the baby safe and sound. You, go with them to the infirmary. Now, Marga, push. Harder. - Very good. - I can't. Life finds a way through, despite the risks, the circumstances, and the obstacles. - Where's Pablo? - Now. Push. Push hard, Marga. Very hard. Marga would have given anything not to give birth in that place. Her strength was declining. Come on, Marga, a bit more. Now! But when failure shows up, you have to hold onto those you love the most. - I want to see Pablo. - You can't think of Pablo now. All you have to think about is pushing. Come on. You can do it. - I can't. I want to see Pablo. Please. - Listen. You can't stop. - I want to see him, please. - Listen. If I get you to speak to Pablo, - do you promise to push hard? - Yes. No, calls to the outside are completely banned. - But, please, look at her. - We're very strict with the rules here. Let her make that call. Mrs. Carmen, can we have a word in private? I made a deal with Lidia. - She'll help me get my revenge on Romero. - A deal? - What will you give her in exchange? - The less you know, the better. - Hello? - Hello? Carlota? Carlota, is that you? Are you okay? Are you all okay? - Marga's gone into labor. Is Pablo there? - I'll put him on. - It's... Marga. She's gone into labor. - What? Marga? What... - She's giving birth right now. - Marga. - Marga! - I'm so scared. No, you don't have to be. Everything is going to be all right. Okay? Everything is going to be all right. - Trust me. - I miss you. Me, too, honey, but we'll be together in no time. Marga, you have to push. They're telling me to push, but I can't. Of course you can! Look, this is what we'll do. If you want, we can do it together, okay? - I'll count to three, and you push, okay? - Yes. All right. One... two... three! Push, Marga. I need you to breathe and to push as hard as you can. The last push, Marga. This baby needs to get out now. I won't be able to do it. - Marga, listen to me. Can you hear me? - Yes. Listen up. You are the strongest and bravest woman I've ever known. You are. And you'll do great. Now push hard, love. Push hard, love. Come on! - Very good. Harder. - Come on, Marga, push! You can do it! - I have the head. You're doing great. - It's coming out. - It's coming out. - Come on, honey! That's it. It's here. What's wrong? - Why isn't my baby crying? - Don't worry. It's okay. Why isn't it crying? Why isn't my baby crying? - What's wrong? Óscar, what's wrong? - Nothing. It's okay. Why isn't it crying? Marga, really. Congratulations, it's a boy. Hello. Pablo, it's a boy. Pablo, it's a boy. It's... a boy. And... - What name are we going to give him? - Julio, like your brother. I wish you could see him. - We'll be together in no time, love. - Hi, Julio. Pablo, Marga is okay, but she needs to rest. Of course. Congratulations, Dad. Thank you. Are you okay? I'm a father. Let's go get Romero. Fifteen minutes left before the game starts. Romero should turn up soon. Let's see if Lidia can get Salgado out on time. She's going to do it. It's not the first time she's done something like this. What can I get you? The same thing as the gentleman. - Are you thirsty? - I'm just having a rough night. And I want it to be over as soon as possible. What happened to you? They just ditched me. - No. - Yes. It looks like my friend preferred to spend the night with another girl. I don't think that other girl is prettier than you. And why are you by yourself? I'm waiting for someone. Your fiancée, maybe? No. You don't bring fiancées to places like this. Sorry, I meant no offense. That came out all wrong. No, it's okay. I think I'd better leave. Please, don't. It's on me. Thank you. Careful! I'm feeling a bit dizzy. I think I should go get some fresh air. Will you come with me? You just drank too fast. I think that if my friend saw you hold me like this, you'd be at risk. Believe me, if that happened, I wouldn't be the one at risk. Let me take you outside. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. They're coming out. Excuse me. Do you have a light? - I've got him. - Come on. - Do you know what to do? - You got him out of there easily. Some things you never forget. Very well. I got you a place in the game. Take the chips. Let's go. Gentlemen... Roncero. Doctor. How are you? It's nice to see you. Excuse me. - What's happening to me? - You drank too much. I didn't drink so much. I'll be right back. I have Romero passed out in the car. How do we do it? I know a perfect place for him, but we'll have to meet tomorrow. Boys. Take him. He's all yours now. I don't want to know what you'll do with him. You just have to honor your part of the deal. It will be tonight. I've counterfeited some documents stating that the ministry has ordered the internees to be taken to another camp. - Will they believe that? - They will. How long will we have until they discover the truth? The morning after, I guess. When they find out the prisoners are gone, the regime will mobilize. The rest is up to you. Even if I don't want to know what you'll do with Romero, you know I could report you for his disappearance, don't you? I wouldn't expect any less from you. Where am I? - What am I doing here? - Do you want to say your last words? Mrs. Carmen. Don't do this! I'm not your enemy. Lidia is the one who should be here. Lidia didn't kill my two children. You did. As you don't have any children, this is the only way for me to take revenge. I should have killed you when I had the chance. Yes, but I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to bury you alive so that you have more time to think about the pain you've caused me. Then, when you're out of air, you'll die. And don't bother shouting. No one will hear you. I made sure that would be the case. You bitch! You'll pay for this! I swear to God... Back then, the consequences of defeat were suffered by the defenseless. But in the darkness of a country ruled by the powerful, there is always room for rivals to take the law into their own hands. When the face-off takes place, only the strongest will prevail. You can leave if you want to. They're about to come down. I'm off, then. I wish you all the very best, Pablo. You, Marga, and the kid. You deserve it. Isidro. - Where is Isidro? - He left. The trucks are already in the back. We need to hurry. - You've been so brave. - Of course, honey. - Come on, get some rest. - Thank you. You look good with him. Do you think so? I do. Pablo and Marga are very lucky. Can you imagine us? We have so many things left to do. The transfer order has been issued. - We'll be free in an hour. - Yes. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go. This document will only help you for now. It won't be long before the truth is discovered. I know. I know, and I hope we'll be far away by then. What about you? What are you going to do? When they find out you helped us, you'll be considered an enemy of the regime. Now you're concerned about me, darling? You're not very good at lying. I just want to know how you'll get away with this. That's my business. Hello, good evening. I'm here on behalf of the ministry to transfer the prisoners. - The document, please. - Yes. Here you are. Hold on a second, please. - The trucks are already here. - Let them in. - They're here. - Let's get them ready. All right. Come in. Thank you. And good night. Operator. Put me through to Oviedo's reeducation camp. Thank you. - Where are the girls? - In module A. - Is Marga with them? - Yes. Someone joined us last minute. I'll go with the girls. Hurry up. What are you doing here? I couldn't let you go. I want to be with you. The moments preceding a victory are unforgettable. Marga! I'm looking for my wife. Her name is Marga. Okay. - Marga! - Pablo! - Marga! - Pablo! - How are you? Are you okay? - Okay. We're okay. Knowing that all the risks you've taken, that every sacrifice you've made, was simply worth it. Hi, Julio. I'm Dad. Failure is now a ghost from the past which won't tarnish happiness. Not the one you feel at that moment, nor the one that is to come. Lidia... Hi, little guy. Girls, let's go. We really have to go now. Let's go. Comrades, it's time to go. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Can you walk? At that moment, surrounded by my friends, I saw that every defeat we suffered, every blow along the way, had just made us stronger. This way. Come on. Sofía, help those people get in the truck. This way. Sofía, are you okay? Yes. Francisco is waiting for you in the first truck. Let's go. Good evening. I'm calling from the Aranjuez center. I'd just like to make sure you have everything ready to receive all our prisoners. You haven't been informed of any transfer? No, don't worry. There must have been a mistake. Good night. Mr. Pinillos! It's not a transfer, they're escaping! Look! At just one step from victory, new enemies who want to see you lose always show up. How are you? Guys, let's go. - Marga. - Francisco. Give me a kiss. But that's not the only surprise you can find. The baby... Goodbye, Mrs. Carmen. I never thought I'd say this, but thank you. No, don't say anything. I don't deserve it. Defeat taught Carmen a terrible lesson in life. I know you'll never be able to forgive me for all the pain I've caused you, but I regret it so much, from the bottom of my heart. You won this war, Lidia, and I'm happy about it because I know Eva has the best mother she could have. But on the night that my enemy saved us all. I want you to do me a last favor. I also learned something. These are the deeds of some plots of land. It's not much, but it's all I have left. I want Eva to have them. She doesn't know me, but Eva will know this is her grandmother's legacy. Redemption is possible if you try really hard... We have to go. Until your last breath of life. Carmen, you can still save yourself. Come with us. No. Go. - Let's go. - Come! No, it's already late for me. Besides. I'm looking forward to seeing my children again. That night I witnessed how the strongest woman I had ever known surrendered. Or so I thought. A woman like her doesn't know failure. Dying was not a defeat, it was all she had left. For Carmen, her blood was everything, and the price she had to pay in order to be with them again. Goodbye, Mrs. Carmen. Come on. Come on, get in. Take this. Mrs. Carmen...
