 - [engine rumbling]
- [music playing over speakers] You're alone. [sniffs] Wanna tell me why? He's not ready. The Chaste needs Matt Murdock. I've tried... but I couldn't convince him. Bullshit. You let him off the hook. I've sent you to do things
a lot harder than this, Elektra. I did everything you said. I made him give in to
his darkest impulses, but he's stubborn. I can't change his mind or who he is.

 Instead, you let him change who you are. - That's not what happened.
- 'Course it is. When have you ever come to me with your
tail between your legs, making excuses? Thought you were
stronger than that, but... here you are, 'cause... you fell in love. We're going to war.
We don't have time for that. For whatever it is
you think you're feeling. [sniffs] He can't do what you and I do. The violence is part of him,
but only to a point. He'll never be able to kill on command. That doesn't make him good, Ellie.
It makes him weak. Ah, forget Murdock. The Hand's moving fast.
Something's coming. We gotta move faster. Maybe there's another way
to win this war you talk about...

 without so much death? [sighs] Like it or not, Ellie,
more death is coming. And you and me gotta get out of its way. [theme music playing] - Extracted from retail.
- Colored HI by GoldBerg_44 [sighs] [Misty] We gotta stop meeting like this. [sighs] - I don't remember anything.
- Well, let me refresh your memory. Two bodies, unidentified.
One headless, the other impaled. What happened last night? - Where are the others?
- That's none of your business. But if you wanna play it coy
and ask to speak to your lawyer, you should know that they
knocked his ass out, too. - Where's Danny Rand?
- Danny Rand was there? [handcuffs rattle] - [sighs] I need to go.
- And I need some answers. Look, we'll start out easy.
Who are the bodies? Who killed them? Was it you? No. Well, it's not like it's completely
out of the question. You've done it before. [scoffs] I know what you're trying to do
and it's not gonna work. If you didn't kill them, then who did? You are wasting time, okay? - People are going to get hurt.
- People are already hurt. What happened to the others? They're down the hall. - Are they okay?
- Looks like it. Listen, I need you to realize
we are on the same side. Now, I held up my end of the bargain.
I protected your friends. It's about damn time you dealt me in. There's a weird shadow organization. I've been tracking them. Not very well. How many were there? Just one. The same one
that came after John Raymond. What kind of person
knocks out you and Luke Cage? [sighs] I'm not sure you'd believe me
even if I told you. Try me. [phone ringing] [breathing heavily] - Whoa, Matt. Hold on.
- Foggy? Where are we? Harlem precinct. Private office. [panting] And if we're painting the whole picture,
you look like shit. - They took your shirt for blood samples.
- Right. Claire gave you a quick look.
Nothing's broken. But the cops have a lot of questions. - I wasn't wearing the suit.
- I know. There is a God after all. Oh, God, I need to go. He's in danger. - Who?
- Danny Rand. Uh, they took him. - The billionaire?
- [sighs] Stick. She killed Stick. [sniffles and sighs heavily] Yeah, Danny. They took Danny. And then now,
I have to save him from the Hand. You are in no position to save anybody. They haven't pressed charges,
but they found you with two dead bodies. I don't have a choice.
He's the Iron Fist. I'm not gonna pretend
to know what that means. Foggy, the person who did this,
who, uh, who took Danny... It's Elektra. - Your ex-girlfriend?
- I understand how it sounds. - She's dead.
- She's not. Not anymore. The Hand took her.
They did something to her. - Whatever she is, she's not herself.
- Matt, you need to take a breath. - You sound insane.
- I don't care if you believe me. Whatever they're gonna do with Danny Rand,
it is not good for anyone. - Mr. Murdock.
- Yes. Is that you, Detective? You're up. I've got one of your clients
scared shitless across the hallway, and the other one passed out, so I'm gonna need for you
to answer a few questions. Oh, well, unfortunately, whatever happened
is protected by attorney-client privilege. That's cute, but cut the shit. 'Cause we both know
you're not just a lawyer in all this. You're something more. As of right now,
you're a person of interest. A witness to a crime. A witness? What, do you want me to describe
how it sounded, Detective? Perhaps you didn't hear me
when I said, "Cut the shit." Now I hear they took Danny Rand. A person with that high of a profile? If this falls back on you...
it's gonna make your life miserable. Look, uh... [sighs]
I wanna help. I can't say much, apart from the fact
that he is in way over his head. And we need to help him. Mr. Murdock, all due respect, you need to start worrying
about helping yourself. His pulse is up a little. Is that good? Long as
it doesn't spike irregularly, sure. What do you think it was? Some kinda drug. They found a weird incense
at the crime scene. His skin's what's bulletproof.
The rest of him is not. You think Danny would have survived it? I don't know, Colleen. Okay, we need to find out what happened.
How long until he wakes up? Could be an hour. Could be a week. [chuckles] I know. [Colleen sniffles] God, how the hell did we get here? With them? I did everything I could
to avoid people with abilities. Quit my job. Moved my ass uptown. - And how'd that work out?
- You tell me. Is sidekick a good look on me? They are fighting a good fight.
You're doing it, too. Not like them. And even Jessica. There are people who run from the fire,
and there are people who run into it. Dumb people. Okay, you said
I was the foundation, right? Look in the mirror. Even before you met Luke, you weren't the type who could just...
stand by and watch. Were you? Claire? Hey. - Where am I?
- You're in the precinct. How do you feel? [sighs] What happened to Danny? Is he alive? [Claire sighs] - [subway train passing]
- [horn blaring] This is not how we do business. It is now. [in Japanese] Black Sky or not,
there are three of us and one of you. [in English] Is that a challenge? We will do what is needed
to preserve our organization. This is not our first coup. It is your first without the substance. Is that a gamble you're willing to take? The Hand is a global organization. For years,
Alexandra fostered relationships with everything from crime lords
to corporate partners. Corporate partners? How do we explain her death to them? [sighs] There's no need for explanations. [in Japanese] What? [in English] These relationships
grant us invisibility in our operations. Our back-room accords.
Our political affiliations. This gives us power. This isn't power. Living underground. In hiding. [Bakuto] You know nothing of power. You didn't exist
until Alexandra gave you life. Didn't I? It's not what you did,
it's how you did it. The Hand has survived this long because
we, above all else, have been astute. Oh. Well, this may come
as a bit of a shock, but I don't care about the Hand. I care about the substance. Because from now on,
nothing will stand in my way. Not even death. - You guys okay?
- [sighs] I'll live. I don't suppose either
of you snuck a flask in here. [chuckles] How are we gonna get out of this? I was gonna ask you the same thing. Three of you wanna sit? Suit yourself. We've had no luck identifying the bodies
we found in the warehouse with you. And though you two have
colorful histories, I have reminded the NYPD - we have no evidence...
- [Strieber] Yet. ...to suggest that you were responsible. Now, I trust Detective Knight, and she says that,
although you're being tight-lipped, the best way to proceed is to treat you
as witnesses and not suspects. You have information that can
fill in the gaps. We need it. [Strieber] Our task force has been tracking
a mysterious crime syndicate for months. They move fast and cover their tracks and often with the blood
of innocent people. - [Misty] People are in danger.
- Captain, my clients are exhausted and under emotional distress. I'm sure you understand
they need to go home. And, see, I'm not sure you understand
the severity of the situation. Everyone who's come in contact
with these assholes turns up dead. Now, either you help us or I start
clearing out a couple of jail cells. They call themselves the Hand. They're real. They're murderers. And they took Danny Rand. - But what do they want with him?
- [Luke] I don't know. They've been after him for a while now. Who knows what they'll do next. Look, when criminals feel like
they're winning, they get sloppy. This could be good for us. No, not these criminals. They don't get sloppy.
They just get more dangerous. It has to be us.
We can take care of this. "We"? There is no "we." Vigilantes don't have jurisdiction.
The NYPD does. [Misty]
Luke, you don't need to protect us. Tell us where to find the Hand.
We can take it from there. I can't. Well, that's it. Okay. Someone call DA Tower.
I'm tired of doing this the hard way. These people don't tell us what to do.
We are the law here. Or has New York
gone completely insane? Captain, before you make any calls,
I'd like to sidebar with my clients. Oh, you can do that... after I book them
for obstruction. And you. Just a word. In private. I would like to explain to them how best
to cooperate in building your case. Well, I hope they like
what you have to say. Otherwise, and I warn you, I'm putting you
in a room with two super-powered people. Last I heard,
they still have legal rights. - You know what, son...
- [Misty] Captain... I think we should let them. Just trust me. Okay. But don't make me regret this. Thank you, Captain. Uh, Detective... would you mind
if I grab Mr. Murdock for a moment? I'll just be a minute. - Okay.
- Thank you. [Matt clears throat] - Hi.
- What's going on? [sighs] You mind if I explain later? Well, it looks pretty bad. It's only a matter of time before
they start to put things together. Yeah, I know, I know. [scoffs] God. I don't understand.
After everything you've worked for? You were finally rebuilding your life. Karen... this is my life. I have to go. [sighs] [sighs] Danny's prepared his whole life
for this fight. He's the Iron Fist. [chuckles] And he will tell that
to anyone who will listen. [sighs] I know him. Deep down inside... he is still
just a kid looking for his family. With me... and with them... almost had it. Can we talk? [Luke clears throat] About? Look, I brought you in to help one family.
But this shit is getting out of hand. I know. It's already out of hand. I know you're trying to do good, but there is a difference
between being a hero and a martyr. You think that's why I'm putting
everyone at risk, because of my pride? I don't know what to think.
Maybe you wanna be a cop again. The truth is,
I've lost sight of your plan. - There is no plan.
- I can tell. - Look, Luke, I am your friend.
- I know, Misty. That's why I'm trying to protect you. Let me. Please. [door closes] [elevator rattling] [Murakami in Japanese] I don't trust her. What if we stop her... before she undoes everything we've done? [in English] The Iron Fist is being led
to the door. We're closer than we've ever been. [in Japanese] She is not one of us. [in English] It does not matter. She has the ability
to bring us a new beginning. And after that,
anything can happen. [gate opening] [Danny] What are we doing down here? [Elektra] That depends on you. Oh, my God. We don't have a lot of time. If they're pressing charges, we want a lawyer who isn't you. - That's not why we're here.
- You're right. We're here because your ex
almost killed every one of us. Yeah, did she take Danny
or did she kill Danny? I don't know.
But if what Stick said is true, and they didn't leave his body,
we have to believe they need him alive. I think she saved him. When you burst in,
the old man was trying to slice him open. Well, he must've known what the Hand
was planning on doing with the Iron Fist. - Which is what?
- We still don't know. [sighs] Where did they take Danny? Midland Circle makes the most sense. [Luke] What from the architect? He was planning on
blowing up the building. Collapsing it straight down into the hole. - They're still digging?
- No. Digging stopped, but there's some structure,
some dome-shaped thing... We found blueprints inside the piano. - The what?
- Don't ask. If they think Danny's a key, maybe whatever it is he unlocks
is in that structure. Oh, my God, this is the dumbest... The question is,
what are we gonna do about it? I mean, I just got out of jail. They don't know who you are, Matt. [knocking at door] - Jesus! Give us a minute!
- It's not the cops. - Hey.
- Can I borrow you? - Not right now.
- Yes, right now. Just give me a minute. - Matt, I need you to hear me out.
- Can you please make this fast? I don't think you understand
the gravity of your current situation. Your real life and your other life are two trains dangerously
close to colliding right now. I am well aware. Did you hear what that cop said? If you're ever investigated,
you lose everything. They'd reopen every case. Matter of fact, I come with you.
We both get disbarred. I'm sorry. I don't have time for this now.
The entire city is in danger. I know. And I'm not dumb enough
to think I can try and stop you. I'm here because I'm trying to help you
keep your two lives separate. So they don't lump you in
with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there. - You understand?
- Yeah, I do. Okay, good. 'Cause the people in this building
need to always, and only, see you as a lawyer. I know. What is this? I still have a key to your place,
so I brought you a change of clothes. - Okay, thank you.
- Anytime. - All right.
- That's what family's for. [Luke and Jessica
speaking indistinctly] [Luke] Look, Jess and I have been talking,
and no matter what it takes... no matter what we have to tell these cops,
we gotta get to Midland Circle. Okay. So long as we're on the same page. Here's my official legal advice. [sighs] You need to get something
out of those three. Luke and Jessica
think they're protecting us. And the lawyer,
God knows what his play is. I don't care. This is the kinda case
that makes or breaks a career. And I'm not talking about mine. Now, you track down and stop
this organization, whoever they are, and brass will be knocking each other over
trying to shake your hand. But you don't break this case, they'll remember that, too. - [crashing]
- [alarm blaring] [people clamoring] Shit! Do you recognize that language? That's why you dragged me down here? To be a translator? What does it say? [Danny] I've seen this language before,
but there's a lot I didn't learn. A lot they didn't tell me. Besides, even if I could read it... [scoffs] I have no idea what this is. Well, lucky for us, I do. Years ago, someone like you
used their abilities to seal this. - How do you know?
- Alexandra talked. I listened. In doing so, they guaranteed that
only one thing could open it. Hmm. Another Iron Fist. Behind that door is the true power
of the Hand. And you expect me to open it for you? I swore an oath to my masters
to protect K'un-Lun and destroy the Hand. I also had masters. But I'm free now.
And you can be as well. I want three units scouring
a ten-block radius. They can't be far. And, Detective... I thought Luke was smarter
than this. I thought... If you want a chance
to save yourself here, you need to reconsider how well
you know these vigilantes. That clear? Find them. [siren wailing] Shit. They got an APB out on us. [scoffs] They think you guys kidnapped me. [scoffs] Great. We're still 20 blocks away. We need to stay off the streets. Should we take a cab? - They kept my wallet.
- Yeah, me, too. Shit. Whatever we do, we need to do it fast. Um... [chiming] It's been a long week. [sighs] [indistinct chatter] [knocking on window] Foggy! Hey! - They're gone!
- I know. They think Luke and Jessica took Matt? - That can't be true, right?
- What do you think? Well, come on. I think Matt's never done
a damn thing he didn't want to. - Yeah.
- [sighs] I don't get it. I don't get it. He was so close to moving on.
Why would he risk it again? Because he has to.
Because this thing is huge. And because... I told him to. - You did what?
- Don't worry. He didn't go as Matt. You gave him the suit? [stammers] I wasn't trying
to open the door for him. I was giving him a chance to close it.
For good. Look, whatever this is, when it's done, - I think we'll get Matt back.
- [sighs] Whole precinct's on alert now and pretty soon every cop in the city
is gonna be on the hunt. So if you know where he's going,
you need to tell me. I don't know. But I'm pretty sure wherever Luke is,
it's where he needs to be. [scoffs] Are you ready to wait a couple years
before you can see him again? 'Cause you know and I both know it's gonna be damn near impossible
for him to get away with this shit. You know what his true north is? Doing the right thing,
no matter the consequence. Far as I can tell, he's finally
finding his place in the world. Look, I just don't want to see him lose
everything that he's worked hard for. I'm just trying to help. Harlem can't afford to lose him. You know, on his first day out of lockup,
you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable
of turning this city around. Of saving somebody. That's exactly what he's trying
to do right now. It may not be convenient
for you or the NYPD. It's really not convenient for me. But we're damn lucky he's the kind of man that doesn't let anything
stand in his way. Wait a minute,
where's the chick with the sword? Oh, shit. [Jessica] We have time
to grab a drink? Or three? - Having second thoughts?
- No. Maybe. You? No. Maybe. - So how do we get in?
- Back entrance. Parking garage. I came looking for Danny
a couple days ago. That's how I got in. A couple days?
God, that feels like three weeks ago. Yeah, tell me about it. There it is again. All right. - [Luke] What's wrong?
- [Daredevil] We're not alone. [sighs] MJ deep cut. - How many?
- Three. Armed. - Just three?
- Not just any three. - Is that the only way in?
- Unfortunately. We're here for Danny Rand. The Iron Fist belongs to us. Well, we're not leaving here without him. Then I guess you're not leaving. [clicking] We don't have to fight. [sighs] Fighting is all the Hand knows. I'm not the Hand. We've been used. Both of us. We've been raised
to fight someone else's war. But you and I, we're the same. All we want to decide is our own futures. You sound like your master, Alexandra. But neither of you know what I want. Alexandra's dead. I killed her. That's what I wanted. And you?
You wanted more than K'un-Lun. That's why you abandoned it, isn't it? They told me all about you.
About your struggle. But what was it for? You're still at this alone. Especially since you know
that your precious elders chose to keep you in the dark. Just like mine did. The only difference between us
is that I took my destiny. You ran away from yours. Maybe you're right. Maybe I did run. Maybe there were things in this world
that I wasn't ready to confront. But you... you are not one of them. [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] I should warn you,
I'm stronger than I look. [Luke grunts] [grunting] [grunts] [screams] [Jessica grunts] - What the...
- [Gao grunts] [Jessica shouts] - [grunts] Not today.
- [grunts] [in Japanese] Light! Now! [grunting] Everyone okay? [panting] Okay is long gone. Hey. You should be at the precinct. You're welcome. [grunting] [groaning] I know what you want,
but you're not gonna get it. Because unlike you,
my master taught me loyalty. Ah, that's why
you're still chained to your master. [grunts and groans] You're gonna fail here,
just as you failed K'un-Lun. [Danny grunting] [Danny breathing heavily] You should've heard the way
they screamed when I killed them. [Danny grunts] [Luke] They gone, Matt? Yeah, for now. What's in the bag? I'm here to save Danny and make sure
no one gets hurt ever again. - How does that answer my question?
- [Colleen] We have to go. What's in the bag? [Daredevil] She's right. [tires screech] Hold it. - Claire?
- What happened here? No time to explain. - Like hell there isn't.
- Please. You got a minute before the full force
of the NYPD is here. So I need you to answer this fast. How long you want me to stall 'em? [grunts] [breathing heavily] [Danny grunting] [panting] [grunting] [Danny screams] [indistinct chatter] That can't be good. - Nope.
- [cell phone ringing] Hey. Yeah, it's Karen.
Yeah, our lights, too. - [alarm sounding]
- [Luke] Keep moving. - [Daredevil] Cops coming.
- [Jessica panting] - [Colleen] Wow.
- You have no idea. [sirens wailing in distance] Freeze! Shit. - Hold your fire.
- [officer on radio] Copy that. Knight, where have you been? I had a feeling they were here, Captain,
so I came down. - [Strieber] Well, are they?
- [Misty] Yeah. But by the time I got here,
lights went out, they were gone. Hey, Cap!
We got movement in the stairwell. [straining] [officer] Shit. - Where's Danny?
- Yeah, where is Danny? There's a structure underground.
He's gotta be there. - [Jessica] How do we get to it?
- Figuring that out. Hey, I don't like it here.
Not at all. Too late. There's an elevator this way.
It goes deep. - Think he's down there?
- Let's find out. [Colleen] Just one more thing. [breathing heavily] What is that? [sighs] This is not happening. We grab Danny and we get him out,
but if we don't end the Hand... sooner or later, they'll come after us. - Oh, my God.
- This is not happening. [sighs] The architect,
he was your guy, right? Don't put this shit on me. No. He had this plan
on how to take this thing out. Okay, I wanna save Danny, too,
but not like this. They'll have us on obstruction of justice
and domestic terrorism. This isn't just about Danny.
It's about New York. You know these people, Claire.
They're relentless. There's no guarantee that exploding
this building ends their organization. It kills their leaders
and cuts the head off the snake. Hey, we're here to save lives,
not take them. - These people aren't really alive.
- [Daredevil] Plus the building is empty. There's no one else here.
It's us and them. You're okay with this? I mean, no, but... she's right.
And the architect knew it. The only way to end this, to save the city
from whatever's coming, is to bring this building down. So unless there are any objections... then that's exactly what we're gonna do. [breathing heavily] [continues breathing heavily] - Extracted from retail.
