 The Defenders 1x05 Take Shelter Who's this? - She's annoying. - Tell me about it. Where's Alexandra? Get down! Dude, get off me. Now it's a goddamn party. - Who are these people? - They want Danny. We want him alive. Oh, shit. We work together, we walk out of here alive.

 No! Wait, I just wanna talk to you. - Where's Matt? What's he thinking? - He's not. Stay with me! This is not who you are. I know you. You died. I held you in my arms. I buried you, Elektra! Elektra. That's your name. Elektra. What have they done to you? What are you doing? I can help you, Elektra!

 They say you can't be broken. We'll see about that. Luke! Get him, now. Let's go, kid. - Where's Luke? - They took him. - More comin'. - Not for long. Hey! Let's go. Get over here, guys! Smells like shit. It's our only way out. Where did they go? And where's the Black Sky? That's a question for our leader. Danny! - Man, am I glad to see you. - Where've you been? I'll explain everything, but first... we have company. Company? Hey! Whoa! I said I'd bring him back. What happened? The Hand attacked us. They took Luke. How do you know they didn't follow you here? We're clear. - What? - No place we land will stay safe for long. - We can't keep running forever. - I'm not running, period. My company owns a building not far from here. We don't need another hideout. We just need for this to be over. - You're oversimplifying it. - Oh, am I? Or am I the only one of us who isn't in this for a cheap thrill? - Jessica. - And the last time we did have a plan, but this one left us to go fight that chick in the spandex. Yeah. Just like he did in Midland Circle. I made a mistake. Luke? - What happened? - Are you okay? I'm fine. Actually, I'm, uh... I'm better than fine. I got one of theirs. - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com -- You're skilled, my child. It's clear, watching you fight, that you know much more than anyone can learn in a single life. That's a compliment. They've said the same thing about me. You've trained me well. I had a daughter once. This was in my first life. Before I made the pilgrimage to K'un-Lun. Before I learned of the substance. And before I started the organization. And she was intelligent, kind... And death took her from me before I learned how to defeat it. In my grief, people told me that she was too good for this world. I didn't believe them. But there was some truth in what they said. She wasn't a warrior. She wasn't like you and me. And now I know... I was never meant to raise her. I was meant to raise the Black Sky. I'm grateful for you. You had no choice in returning from death. I realize that. But I hope you understand that this is the life you were chosen to lead, as a weapon against our enemies. If you do not fulfill that role... you're of no use to the Hand. Or to me. Of course not. I have news. Sowande has been taken. By whom? We can only assume it was the Iron Fist and his allies. Over the years, the five of us have escaped every manner of danger and death. He will find his way back to us. In the meantime, tell the others that our reinforcement from South America will be arriving soon. And together, we will expand our search for the Iron Fist. I will. There is something else we must discuss. Later. As you wish. How long do you think he'll be out? - Not much longer. - How do you know? Because this is happening. What are you doing in New York? There's nothing you can do to make me betray my own. I'm up for the challenge. Don't bother. The fingers were cast out of K'un-Lun. Which means he trained with the same monks that raised him. - So? - Put us through brutal trials. It's called discipline. It means he won't crack. Not by force. You know nothing of the power of the Hand. You are mice who fell into a well. Believe me, this will drown you. What do you want with our city? Your city? This place belongs to the Hand. It always has. - What do you mean, "always"? - I traced it back to 1820. - That's all? - Why do you want Danny Rand? Nothing you can do can make me serve you. Do you understand? Do I understand? You are the dumbest Iron Fist yet. Tell me what you want with me. We want the Fist. You are nothing. Danny Rand failed an entire city. The place he was sworn to protect. The same way the unbreakable one let that boy die in a jail cell. Afraid and alone. The same way the woman couldn't save the architect. What's wrong? Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago? Hey, hey, hey. What about the ones you still love? What will become of them once you are gone? - Who else must die because of you? - What are you talking about? The nurse. The woman on the radio. They'll come for them next. How many mice must drown with you? He talked too much. - Claire, I need you to get dressed. - What's going on? - Is your mom still here? - No, she's in Jersey with my tía. Okay. We need to go now. Danny and Colleen are downstairs keeping an eye out for us. Keeping an eye out? I'll explain everything in the car. You took the fight to the Hand. It went well at first, but now we're all in danger. I hate being right all the time. It'll only be for a couple days. So, are you gonna tell me what this is all about? At this point, the less you know, the better. Are you sure about that? A couple days ago, I'm the one who introduced you to Danny Rand. Yeah, and you also told me to focus on myself. Part of me wishes I had listened. - I'm sorry. - For what? All of it. I never meant to make my trouble your trouble. Pretty sure your trouble is my trouble now. The old blind guy kept saying that... he needed to get to you before they did. It's because the Hand doesn't wanna kill me. They want me alive. He tell you why? No. To be honest, I don't think he knows, either. Then why are you listening to him? What do you mean? Why are you listening to any of them, Danny? When I said that we should find others, I did not mean... This is not their fight, it's ours, and keeping them around is a liability. You haven't really seen what they can do. That's not the point. Hey. Quick. Hello, Colleen. Sensei. You look well. You're supposed to be dead. I tried death. It didn't take. Stand down. She's an old friend. We are far from friends. I wouldn't say that. When you're done with that, I'd like to talk. There's nothing left to talk about. It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it? What do you want with Danny? They sent me for him, yes. But I came for you. Bullshit. You told me I wasn't good enough for the Hand. It was a strategy. To bring out your anger. To cause you to make a mistake. We have a second chance to finish what we started. Brainwashing me? Brainwashing? You flourished under my training. Became the fighter you were meant to be. The fighter you wanted me to be. The one you needed for whatever horrible shit you're trying to get away with. Join me, Colleen. This time I'll tell you everything. I anticipated this reunion. I didn't. I'll never stop. You took my life from me. No, I haven't, Colleen. Not yet. I wish it could end another way. That dude was for sure dead last time we saw him, right? - Oh, yeah. - Okay, just checking. Remember the last time we faced off, Bakuto? I do, Mr. Rand. And I look forward to doing it again. You really shouldn't. I heard you'd made some friends. Smart move, considering she never believed in her purpose, and you've yet to discover yours. Soon, Iron Fist. You'll learn your destiny is much more than what they told you in K'un-Lun. We need to get her someplace now. - Hi. - Hey. It's after midnight. Yeah. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important. I'm gonna need a little more than that. It's the Hand. They came for you before, Karen. I can't let that happen again. I don't believe this. - I know. They're back in New York, and I... - No, no, it's not them. You. This is how you tell me that you're doing it again? 'Cause that's what you're saying. You're going out as him. Uh, no, actually. Uh, well... not yet. All right, but you told me you didn't miss it... I know what I said. We don't have to have this conversation. Just talk to me. Please, Matt. Just... just tell me. I'm doing it again. Because if I don't, people will die. Whatever the Hand is up to... New York is in its crosshairs. I have to do this. I know. But I don't. I don't need your protection, Matt. Whatever it is you're doing, or Daredevil is doing, I'm not a part of it anymore. So... That may be the case, yeah. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter if you're a part of Daredevil's world or not, because they may be coming after Matt Murdock's, too. I'm sorry, does that mean they know who you are? - Just can't take any chances. - Matt, that isn't your call. Can you please just come with me? Just lay low, a couple days. That's all I'm asking. I'm sorry. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, well, don't. I'm not doing this for you. It's just... self-preservation at this point. You deserve better, Karen. So do you. Office pool. I'm putting in, like, $10. I'm going for... - Misty. - Luke. I need your help. Okay. What's going on? You know those people you were after? The ones that killed Cole? - Yeah. - They're not stopping anytime soon. - Well, what do you know? - It's... It's complicated, but they're very dangerous. Any chance that four-star shit-show at the Chinese restaurant was your fault? What have you gotten yourself into, Luke? Just tell me. I've got the full resources of the NYPD. I might know something. - Hell, we might even be on the same side. - You know we're on the same side. You wouldn't believe me if I told you anyway. Then I don't know how I can help you. You got a chair? What the hell? We've got more coming. Please. Trust me. Okay? Yeah. I was wondering when I'd see you again. Me, too. Guess it won't be today. That army you used to fight alongside... The Chaste. They captured me once. This was years ago. Long before you were born. I had been captive three days when they heard my soldiers approach. The fortress fell silent. The gates remained locked. The Chaste couldn't comprehend it. But the soldiers outside, they were following my orders. They sealed the gates, allowed no one in or out. On the third day, your soldiers turned on each other. By the fourth, they'd run out of water. By the sixth, no food. I believe it was the tenth day that they knelt before me. Begging to make it stop. Well... if I kneel before you right now, shithead, will you shut up? It won't be long before your plan comes apart. Before this chair I'm in becomes a throne. - We're getting everyone safe. - Good. - He give you anything yet? - What do you think? If she's as sweet as she smells, - I get why you're tore up about this one. - Don't bring her into this. All these years, this is what I've been protecting you from. Your two worlds colliding. If you had it your way, this is what my life would be. Now you're trying to spin it like you're protecting me. - Maybe I got soft in my old age. - Doubt it. Or maybe I know what I need on the front lines. 'Cause the Iron Fist can't lead 'em like you can. I don't wanna lead anyone, Stick. For a man who believes in God, you sure like denying - He has a plan for you. - Don't use my faith against me. And what about this city? The place you can't live without. The place that made you what you really are. - Where are you going? - Don't... You don't get to tell me who I am, all right? Trust me, I know. I guess what I'm saying is I see a future for Trish Talk that dives into some more investigative reporting. This tremor stuff, for example, I don't know if you guys know, - but a lot of our listeners are having a... - Trish. Jess? - I need her for a minute. - What? - Come on, we gotta go. Meeting's over. - Excuse me for one second. - Are you okay? - No. You know that case I took? The architect? The C-4? Well, it went south fast, and you may be in danger. Me? It doesn't matter. I can't just leave those people. They are safer far away from us. Trust me. I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast. Shit. Stairwell. Go. Jesus! When I said I thought you should get back to work, I didn't mean you should go... Jess! Jess! That hurt so much. No way. The scarf looked better. - Nice ears. - They're horns. Not how I imagined my day looking. Maybe this is exactly where I'm supposed to be. What do you mean? Hidden here. Away from the action. Left behind. - I don't even know anymore. - He was wrong back there. About your being weak. When you're raised in something like that... when they've formed the foundation for who you are... breaking away is, like... I feel lost. I can't believe I'm admitting this, but... all I want... is something stable. Something I can hold on to. Funny you should say that. Because I know you. I know Danny. I know this fight with the Hand. And where I'm standing... you are the foundation. So how are you holding up? Did you know Jessica knows Daredevil? - What? The costume guy? - Yeah. And some guy attacked us. I think it's connected to the tremors. - I mean, it has to be, right? - Ugh. Yeah, um, maybe. Do you want one? - Uh, I'm... I'm okay. - Smart. Who's she? Reporter. Think she's here to write a story? Doesn't look like it. You, too? Jesus! Oh, my God, am I glad to see you. I'm glad to see you. Gotta be honest, I'm glad to have a break from depositions. - Yeah. - What's the story? Matt didn't tell you? Matt doesn't tell me anything. It's happening again. I know. I tried to steer him away. Yeah, me too. And it still wasn't enough. Funny. If I didn't know any better, I'd think he's trying to tell us something. - Yeah. - All right, listen up, everybody. I know you don't wanna be here, but it seems that you are all of interest to some pretty powerful and dangerous people. Now, to protect you, I need your cooperation. Sit tight for now. We'll have more answers soon. Hopefully. Colleen Wing? Yeah. Yeah. I'm told my uniforms confiscated something unusual from you. - It's a katana. It was passed down... - It's weird. Okay. Uh... Look, I don't need to be here. I can defend myself. You came in here pretty bloody. Are you sure about that? Yeah. Yeah, I am. What can you tell me about these people that you're fighting? Nothing. The more I tell you, the more danger I put you in. I'm getting pretty sick of people telling me that. It's true. Why else would we be here? I'm here 'cause I'm a cop. Trust me, they don't give a shit. Just in case. Thanks. Are we no longer on speaking terms? As long as we're in this organization, as long as we are alive, we will be on the same side. Do you remember what it looks like? The only way we return to it is if we secure the Iron Fist. Oh, that is why I am here. But the first person you sought out was Colleen Wing. Hmm, yes, that was our assignment. She could lead us to the Iron Fist. - And she did. In fact... - Along with his allies. It is not as simple this time. Or you are not as committed. Your judgment has always been clouded when it comes to your old disciples. Just because I don't blind my disciples, doesn't mean I'm made weak by them. - It's good to see you. - Save it. - We have a situation. - We know, and we plan to correct it. We will discuss your failure to acquire a few bargaining chips next. But first... The Iron Fist has a new partner in his fight. Daredevil. - So cool. - I mean, it's... it's kind of cool. I'm gonna make this real simple. You're gonna answer our questions or shit's gonna get dark in here. What do they call you? The Devil of Hell's Kitchen? Even if you could kill me, it wouldn't make a difference. Cut off a finger... you can still use your hand. We will win. We have armies. We have our weapon. Let's talk about your weapon. What did you do to her? What did you do to Elektra? Elektra? Yeah. You dug up her grave. And what did you turn her into? The body you knew was merely a vessel, waiting for its purpose. She's ours now. If she's your vessel... why hasn't she killed me yet? Twice now, she could've taken my life, but she hasn't. Why do you think that is? Huh? Your weapon is defective. Then she will be destroyed. Not on my watch. Hey, stop. You can't undo this. Admit it. - Elektra's still in there. You failed. - You're the one who failed. Elektra died on a rooftop in your arms because you couldn't protect her. Shit. Is he dead? Eh, unfortunately, no. Passed out. I think it's time to tell them the truth, kid. Are you sure? Daredevil has not been active in this city for a while. I saw him with my own eyes. Why is this a concern? He's a skilled fighter, yes, but so are we. It is not his fighting that worries me. It is his relationship with Elektra Natchios. She fought side by side with him in her last life. It is more than that. He is the one she loved. When she attacked me... at first, I thought she was protecting her kill. But you think she was protecting him. I do not think she is the empty vessel we were promised. Is this what you wanted to discuss with me earlier? You believe the Black Sky has failed us? No. I believe you have. You made a unilateral decision and used the last of the substance to resurrect her. And now, we are all vulnerable. Actually, I have never felt better than with her at my side. Except, it's not about you. It's about us. He's right. Five fingers created the Hand. We're stronger together. There are only four now. Sowande is gone. - He will return. - You don't know that. For the first time, death is a possibility. Even if he doesn't, we will survive. Except the Black Sky... almost killed me. Then there would be three. Perhaps this is what we needed. A reminder that everyone in this room is expendable. Everyone. Including you. You seem to have forgotten why we started this mission. Why we need the Iron Fist. No, I haven't. It's because we all want to live to see another day. You are afraid of dying. We want to live long enough to go home. Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky. Or our fearless leader. I was willing to work with you. But how can I trust you? Her name is Elektra. She was raised by him. Trained to fight the Hand. Which she did, with me. Until they convinced themselves she could serve another purpose and killed her. - She looked pretty alive back there. - I know, but I was there when they... I was holding her when she died. Elektra died. That thing we've been fighting, it's something else. She was resurrected. Right. How come you didn't tell us? Wait a minute. What do you mean, "resurrected"? His ex-girlfriend. - Now he thinks he can save her. - That's why you nearly got us killed? When I said her name, she recognized it. She knew me. I think whatever they did when they resurrected her, I think I can get through to her. Okay, to be clear, we've now used the word "resurrected" three times. It's what they do. We agreed to put everything on the table, Matt. If we're gonna defeat the Hand, we gotta take her out. No, Stick. I won't allow it. Do you know how hard this is to believe? It doesn't matter what you believe, at the end of the day... whatever she is, she's a problem. - Lying is a problem. - I didn't wanna lie. - I was trying to protect her. - Well, I'm not. Now the people I care about are held up in a precinct because you got me protecting some woman you used to know. Don't oversimplify it. I'm trying to help. The truth is simple, Murdock. Don't move. Let's not kid each other. This is personal for every one of us. But now I have the Iron Fist. The key to what the Hand seeks. The key to life, to our salvation. The war is over. Oh. Not yet. My child? I need a word. - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com --
