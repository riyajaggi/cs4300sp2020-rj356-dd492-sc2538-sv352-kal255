 The Defenders 1x04 Royal Dragon Thank you so much for coming. - Good to see you again. - Thank you. Thanks. - We're closed. - We need to kill the lights. - How do you even know they're on? - Hey, I said we're closed! We need to stay off the streets. Well, stay off them somewhere else. I'll call the police. You can't do that. You'd be putting the cops in danger. - I'll put you in danger. - I'm done explaining this. What are you doing?

 Whoa! She is very strong. Sir, this is for your protection. We need this place to look closed. It is closed! We have no intention of hurting you. - You speak Chinese? - You can trust us. I still hear neon. Who hears neon? My blind-but-maybe-not lawyer. You're what? What do you mean he's blind? I don't know. I thought he was sent to spy on me, and now I'm not so sure. - You think he's on our side? - Our side of what? - Who's Karate Kid? - Danny Rand. Boy billionaire?

 He's a little off in the head, but he packs a mean right hook when it counts. So do you. You okay? - Now, or in general? - Both. Well, I'm alive. You? Just getting back into the world. - From where? - Prison. Yeah, we'll... we'll talk about it later. How'd you end up here? - I'm working a case. - Yeah? How's that going for you so far? All right, back door is clear. Everything's locked. I think we're safe for now. - So we're just gonna wait it out here? - You got a better plan? Is there a plan where I get my scarf back? I just need it till this is over. - What, do you two know each other? - Yeah. How? We met. We drank. I shot him in the head. Why are you still wearing that thing? - It's... - Okay. He says we can stay. - What did you tell him? - Uh, I just gave him my black card, agreed to pay the rent for the next six months. - Hey, I'm, uh... I'm Danny. - Jessica. - And, uh... you are? - No, I can't. I'm not doing this. - Doing what? - Whatever happened back there, we did what we had to. We got out alive. The less we know about each other, the better. - This is... It's too much already. - Okay. - Don't... - Jesus. - There are people I need to protect... - You're not the only one. And the organization we just fought are powerful. - Yeah, who are they? - They call themselves the Hand. - What are they really called? - No, he's... he's right. You crossed paths with them before? - Yeah. - When? - It doesn't matter. - Bullshit it doesn't matter. - Yeah, I'm with her. - We need to figure out our next move. No. There's no next move. And there is no "we." They came at us, we fought our way out. Let's call it professional courtesy. End of story. Look, it's not that simple. - These people, they're dangerous. - So am I. Now, somebody tell me what I need to know about the Hand, so I can be on my way. What is that? Oh. Um, as, uh... as part of the deal, he made me order four of everything. We're not here to eat. - Uh, are those pork? - No, they're shrimp. Oh. - Oh. This guy's got pork. - Ah, great! God, you're weird. The Hand is an ancient criminal organization. Define ancient. - They live forever. - You wanna try that again? They live by a fanatical ideology, and every member is willing to die to protect it. - So they're terrorists? - No. Terrorists want the world to know what they're doing. This is something more secret, more evil. And they're global. - So what do they do? - Everything. Including the recruitment of young men in Harlem? Apparently. They're in New York for a reason, but I don't know why. - What do you mean, "fanatical ideology"? - Gonna sound crazy... - What do they want? - Immortality. They want power and influence at every level across the world. And I think they want me. - For your money? - No. I'm the Immortal Iron Fist. Come again? Sworn protector of K'un-Lun. What are you on? Lithium? So, who was the woman with the swords? Look, I'm not sure, but I fought her in Cambodia. Yeah, and she showed up at my doorstep. She's the one that came after your client? Yeah. Why? Do you know her? - No. - Well, she sure knew what she was doing. The Hand trains fighters to be merciless. But whoever she was, man, she was something else. - This is a mistake. I gotta go. - Where? I can't be a part of this. If you ask me, you already are. We need to put it all on the table. - I don't know you. I don't owe you any... - I don't trust you. You wanna take your hand off my shoulder? Take off the mask. You're not gonna like where this is heading. Try me. Oh, boy. Counselor, a word? Where do you think you're going? You're gonna need another lawyer. - Why did you follow me into the building? - Ms. Jones, lose my card. I wish I could. Look, I've been down this road before. - I know what we're up against. - I know who you are. No, you don't. Trust me. Yes, I do. You're the Devil of Hell's Kitchen. Or Devil Boy, - or whatever it is you like to be called. - Whatever you're insinuating, - I don't have any clue. - I'm a PI. I put two and two together. Besides, you leaping around the city like a Russian gymnast didn't exactly help. - You don't have any proof. - I did. You smashed it. I'm not threatening you. I'm just stating the obvious. They saw you fight. How you're hiding your face. They're two seconds away from figuring it out themselves. - What do you want from me? - Nothing. And I want zero to do with this ancient organization. I just want to crack my case. And judging by the way you sprung into action, I think you want the same thing. Your call, Murdock. My name is Matthew. - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com -- I'd erase all the marks of your past, if I could. Your life is new. But sadly, your body is not. This is how I died? Don't worry about that. All that matters now is how you live. The Black Sky. This is all I am? You say that like it's not enough. It is. I just... You just can't help but wonder. The woman who lived in this vessel, she was lost before she came to us. She was led astray by men who were afraid of what she was, of what she was capable of doing. But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs. With us. With me. Who are you? The Black Sky. I serve the Hand. "And together, we serve life itself." You are my last hope. You have seen death, my child. And like me, you have conquered it. Don't forget who brought us back. I will not forget. I heard he just disappeared. That's not exactly how it happened. It just doesn't make any sense. What do you mean you're Daredevil? It's a long story. One I'd rather not tell. More importantly, it's a secret I keep not just for the sake of protecting myself, but also for the people that I love. - Okay. I get that. - Good. - I don't. You're blind. - Yeah, well, sight is overrated. Look, guys, we need to come up with some kind of plan here. The only plan is how do we get these people off our backs? Ideally, in a way that doesn't incriminate us. Incriminate us? What are you talking about? None of us are on police payroll. What we did back there was trespassing, aggravated assault, and vigilante bullshit. Guys, there's one cop I think we can trust. - I think we should bring her in. - No. You'd be putting her in danger. As will anyone who goes up against the Hand. And as for doing this any "legal" way... Well, look, you saw what happened when we tried that. - Is that what that was? - It started that way. Look, I even put on a tie. I promise you, you cannot fight these people. Not even with whatever it is your hand can do. - It's chi. - It's not. What I'm saying is, going at them head on, that'll get you killed. Only if we do it alone. No. Look, these people took everything from me. I'm gonna take them down, one way or another. I wanted to help one kid. One family. I'm the first to admit when I'm in over my head, and this is way past my threshold. What are you talking about? Bulletproof. Blind ninja. - Whatever it is you are. - Classy. I tried being a one-man army, and it failed. But this... This feels like something else is at work here. The four of us show up to fight a criminal organization at the same moment? How obvious does it have to be? This... - This cannot be an accident. - Okay. I know you mean well, but we're not whatever you think we are. All right? We're four very different people, and while we might all have been trying to do some good, we need to be rational about how we proceed. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. This... is one shitty excuse for a hideout. Stick. Matty. Who the hell are you? The guy that's gonna help you save New York. It's a bad idea to sneak up on a man holding a knife. Who says I'm sneaking? Ursus thibetanus. The moon bear. Endangered now, but I found this one in Shikoku. I heard you were in Japan. Were you having me followed? You have your sport, I have mine. Ten days, I tracked him. We sparred in the forest. He nearly killed me. They always nearly kill you. There's no fun in it otherwise. You know where the organization stands. Our resources are depleted. Is that why you came here? To scold me like a child? No, but you should worry about the possibility of death. From what I hear, we all should be worried. We're close now. And the Iron Fist has returned to New York. I heard you were unable to secure him. We will. Then we're not close enough. The problem with your leadership has always been your inability to get your hands dirty. In all our time together, I have never asked for your advice. And why would you? Now that you have the Black Sky by your side. Yeah. The Iron Fist was not alone. Was the Chaste not extinguished? He seems to have found some allies. Three of them. Only three? They were rather exceptional. And so, you come to me. I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together. Have you told the others? Madame Gao and Sowande are ready and willing. And the other one? On his way. I always knew we'd reunite someday. I never thought the circumstances would be this dire. That's what families do, isn't it? And what of your Black Sky? The thing you spent our final resources on. More powerful than you could ever imagine. Does this mean our faithful leader herself will also join the fight? As always, I do what's necessary. Then, as we used to say... "Together, we serve life itself." "Together, we serve life itself." Black Sky. Perhaps you'd be more effective on the battlefield if you killed your enemies, rather than letting them escape. Alexandra insisted we use the last of our resources on you. The ultimate weapon of the Hand. But after your recent failure... well, I can't help but ask myself if you are a weapon at all. Keep asking. Does that man have one hand? - How did you find us, Stick? - You know this guy? - It's complicated. - Then uncomplicate it. - He's one of them, aren't you? - The Hand? No. There's another organization. We call ourselves the Chaste. Ugh! These names are killing me. And we're the only reason the Hand hasn't already won the war. We follow the elders of K'un-Lun... and the Immortal Iron Fist. The Chaste is my army? Was. They're all dead now. Every one, except me. How come no one told me? There are things I don't know. Why are you here, Stick? Because this one, the Immortal Iron Fist, living weapon and protector of the ancient city, is still a thundering dumbass. New rules, kid. Shit like that... will get you killed. I tried to call Colleen. I told her where I was. Where is she? Safer than we are. Small mistakes. Personal ties. These are what they'll use to end you. What happened to your hand? Ah, I cut it off to free myself. Now, I need your help. - Yeah, here it comes. - Here what comes? - This is what he does. - How do you know him again? You saw me fighting? I learned it from him. You're a blind lawyer, you're Daredevil, - and you're a member of the Chaste? - No, uh-uh. I never joined his war. Hey, Stick, you and I need to talk. Anything you gotta say, you say in front of us. - This is between me and him. - Hey, we are all in danger. I don't know you very well, Mr. Cage, you seem like a good guy, so trust me when I tell you that with this old man, nothing is sacred. Kid, it's not just one of us this time. It's the whole goddamn city we're talking about. We're talking about their lives, Stick. We're talking about the lives of their loved ones. - Wait, um, what? - Those tremors that shook up the place, they're nothing compared to what comes next. The Hand's done it before. Pompeii, Chernobyl. Events the history books like to call catastrophes, just cover-ups. 'Cause New York is next. And the only thing keeping Manhattan from crumbling to a pile of dust... is the four of you. All right, I am done with this tin-foil-hat shit. - Whoa, where are you going? - I tried to hang in, guys. I really did. But whatever this guy's selling, I ain't buying. Sit down and shut up. - Jessica. - It's not gonna work. I know parts of this sound crazy. Parts of it? Throw out all this mystical, ancient conspiracy stuff, and you're still left with one hard fact. People are gonna get hurt. - Not you. - This isn't about me. That's a concept you might want to try on sometime. Give me a break. Hey, these abilities that you have such contempt for... they might do some good right now. This war, or whatever it is, this is not my problem. I just want to get answers for my client. I want answers, too. And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them. I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me. It was good to see you. Let me know when they fit you for a costume. Jessica. Just... be careful. - Yeah, you too. - And, um... it was good seeing you. Yeah. Yeah. She coming back? No, she left. Use your powers? No, I've just met her. How can she not understand how big this is? Well, I don't know her too well, but like me, she has a life. No matter how big or small it is, it's still hers. After all you've been through, Matty, I thought you'd be more open-minded when the time came. Well, forgive me if I'm not excited at the prospect of facing the Hand again. Yeah? How'd you get involved in the first place? He's one of the most naturally skilled fighters I've ever known. I saw. Yeah, I trained him to fight a war. He decided to put on an outfit. Stop muggers in back alleys. Well, from what I've heard, you're... you're doing a good job. Past tense. He's retired. You know what? We are not talking about this, all right? Suit yourself. But I think you two have got a lot to learn from each other. - Of course. - I'm done taking lessons, Stick. Lessons ain't done with you. This isn't her fight. Sooner or later, it's gonna be everybody's fight. Not if I can help it. Me neither. All right. Let's just get this over with. Seems like now is the time for you to tell us everything we need to know. Thank you. Yes, there's been a change of plans. I have other business tonight. All right. Delete. That's the same person. What the hell? Nobody knows when it started. Centuries ago. Millennia. It doesn't matter. But a long time ago, the elders of K'un-Lun gathered to study how to harness their chi. The energy of life itself. They wanted to use it to heal. But there were five heretics among them, people with darker intentions. They didn't want to heal. They wanted immortality. Power. To never face death. To regenerate themselves again and again. The elders saw this as an aberration. And so, like Lucifer from heaven, the five were banished from K'un-Lun forever. They became the five fingers of the Hand. I came face-to-face with a woman at Midland Circle. She said she was the Hand. She's had a lot of names throughout the years. In my lifetime, Alexandra. And she's led them since the beginning. When they dispersed, they all went back to their mother countries, each finger ruling over its own domain. Growing in power and influence. Madame Gao? She's one. She helped set up my parents' murder. She set up a lot of murders. Then there's Sowande, African warlord, gunrunner, you name it. - The one I followed. - Don't follow too closely. Couple of moves, he'll slow your pulse till your heart fails. Then there's Bakuto. He's dead. At least the last time I saw him. Oh! Finally, some good news. Who's the last one? Murakami. The guy who pulled the strings behind Nobu. Maybe the most secretive, but when he comes out... an evil piece of shit. It's nothing we can't handle together. That's great, Stick, but why are you here? What are you expecting us to do about it? Don't bullshit me. I know when you're lying. Maybe you should just back off a bit. In the past few minutes, he's given me more information - than I ever got from K'un-Lun. - That's because he wants something. Because what he wants will put everyone we care about at risk. - Yeah, you've said that. - And I'll keep saying it. I've lost plenty in this war. Don't talk to me like I'm some kid! - Don't act like some kid. - What did you just say? - Danny, calm down. - You calm down, Luke. You don't get second chances with these people, all right? If you're not careful, the next thing you know, you're dead. Or worse, you're holding the people you love the most in the world and... You get the privilege of watching them die. All right, maybe this city is at stake. Maybe this fight is important. I get that. I'm just saying, imagine knowing for the rest of your life, you only made it worse by getting involved. Jesus. - Hey. - What time is it? Late. Or early. Depending on your life choices. Is everything okay? How you holding up? Fine. I mean... as well as we can be. And your daughter? She's asleep. - Are you drunk? - No. I mean... it doesn't matter. - You wanna come inside? - No, I just... I just wanted to say, you might be right. So whatever your husband got into, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder. - What do you know? - I can't say, but I'm gonna work on getting you guys some protection. - Like, around-the-clock surveillance. - Why? - Uh! Please don't ask. - No, I just mean... I thought you already did that. - What do you mean? - The car. It's been there since last night. He said he was a cop. Did he show you a badge? No. - Stay here. - Wait. Who's in that car? Stay away from the windows. Do you hear me? Go. Be with your daughter. I'll take care of this. How are you still hungry? It takes a lot of energy to summon my chi. What? Come on, you've seen it in action. Twice now. I liked it better on my side of the fight and not the side of my face. Yeah, me too. Don't get too used to it. What? - We make quite a team. - Oh, let's not use that word. What word? Look, I'm not looking for super friends. Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that. You came to Midland Circle for a reason. I came to help Harlem. Not you. Come on. I didn't need help. You serious? Look, all I'm saying is, like it or not... we're walking the same path. We fix this thing together. Then that path comes to an end. Last one? I'm glad you found others. Don't act like this is normal. Don't act like I don't know what's really going on with you. You crossed paths with her, too? With who? Don't bullshit me. Elektra. How'd you know? I know you, son. - She's the only reason you're here. - She's alive, Stick. No, she's not. She's something else. You didn't mention her in front of them. Neither did you. Guess she's our little secret. I couldn't hear her heartbeat. That's 'cause the girl I trained, the woman you loved... she ain't there anymore. - Maybe we can help her. - No, we can't. When they brought her back, they made her forget. No. She hesitated. She didn't kill me. She had... She had the chance. Don't try to make sense of this. 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die. You hear what I hear? Someone's outside. Ah! Jesus, am I the only one left who doesn't know karate? This family has been through enough. Whatever her husband did, she doesn't know anything. She's not a threat, and neither is the kid. Nod if you understand me. Now nod if you're gonna leave them alone. Let me make this very clear. What'd he say? What language is that? I'm no black belt. You let me know when that hurts. Stay back there. Lock the door. You think it's them? It's hard to tell. How'd they find us? It was a matter of time. Who's inside? Weapons. Couple of guns, fully loaded. - How about the woman with the swords? - I don't know. I can't... I can't tell. Well, I'll be goddamned. This wouldn't be my first choice, but I am a sucker for fortune cookies. You know, I thought it would be a good idea if we all talked this over... like adults. What do you want? You surprised me, Stick. You've become so resourceful in your old age. What have you become in yours? Determined. Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit from our meeting was so abrupt. You tried to kill us. Oh, them maybe. Not you. My organization has always had a great deal of respect for the protector of K'un-Lun. Your respect means nothing to me. My only purpose is to take you down. Something you've repeatedly failed to do. Perhaps it's time to consider some alternatives. There are no alternatives. Oh, darling, there are always alternatives. That's what makes life interesting. Cut the shit, Alexandra. - What do you want? - The same thing I've always wanted. To bring light into the dark. To bring life where there is death. For all your talk of life, you sure kill a lot of people. I don't think we've been properly introduced. Let's keep it that way. I can see you've formed a kind of bond here. And while that might give you some comfort, I promise you, it's temporary. They will disappoint you. They haven't yet. They will not make you stronger. And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you. What do you want to do with him? Well, I can't disclose that. But I'll tell you what I'm willing to do for him. I'll assemble all the resources my organization has to offer. You remember the last time all the fingers of the Hand came together, don't you, Stick? - A goddamn culling. - Hmm. And New York is so densely populated. What are you talking about doing? Think of how many lives you can save if you just come with me. What do you want? Kid, don't even think about it. I just want an answer. I might even let them go free. You walk with her... and I'll take you out myself. I'm not going anywhere. Mr. Rand... you need to think this through. And you need to leave. Now. Oh, they're just like you, old man. The only language they speak is violence. Go on, my child. Serve life itself. Who missed me? - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com --
