And you still want Otto and me gone when I'm done, well, I'll sign whatever you want and we clear on out. - Dang lighter! - I'm a busy man, Mr. Dvorchack. I don't have time for drunken ramblings and crazy stories. If we could just move this... - One night, couple years back... - Fuck me. - ...me and my friend Pearly, we... - [lighter ignites] Eh? Me and my friend Pearly were having a drink and conversatin', like. [laughs] Oh, boy, I tell ya. Hell, you oughta get up off yer duff and see the world. Oh, what for? Everything I need ends up here eventually. Oh, yeah? What about women? I don't see no women round here. Pearly, she's right there. Oh, sorry. No offense, Betty. But I am telling you, boy. Down in Laredo, they got these river trash whores. Oh, boy! [laughing] They can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch. - [metal clangs] - Hey, you hear that? It's just rats. Tell me about the whores. Hold your horses a minute. My back teeth are floating. [Pearly] Come on out, ya little monster. [chuckles] Yeah, boy. [metal banging] [rattling] What?

All manner of crap stickin' out of it. It's all shiny and wet. [Pearly yelps] [gulps] My balls! [screams] Aargh! Help me! [gargled scream] I don't wanna go! Let go, Pearly! I can't shoot! [creature moans] Pearly! [creature howls] [banging and rattling] [creature growls and snorts] [creature moans] Give my friend back, motherfucker! I'ma get you, you son of a bitch. [engine starts] [engine revs] [tires screech] Die! [cackles] [howls] What in the shit? [howling] [reverse gear beeping] Now fuck me ragged. - [whimpers] - A puppy. [groaning] [Dvorchack] And that's when a big old light bulb went off in my head. This here monster wasn't just created by all the heat and garbage. It lived off it. And whatever it ate became a part of it. [incoming message alert] [Inspector laughs] They're gonna love this one back at the office. Sorry. So, you were saying about Curly? His name was Pearly. Right. And it's an absolutely riveting tale, Mr. Dvorchack, but I can actually feel myself getting septic shock sitting here. So, if you'll just make a big X on those papers, I can finally get out of this shit hole. Otto! There you are, boy! [creature growls] [metal clanging] What? [screams] No! No! Mr. Dvorchack! [screaming] Yep. The way I see it... you hang around a dump long enough and the world comes to you. Ain't that right, Otto? [screams] [Dvorchack laughs] [whistles] Here, boy! Attaboy! [Dvorchack] Yes, sir, the dump's my home.
