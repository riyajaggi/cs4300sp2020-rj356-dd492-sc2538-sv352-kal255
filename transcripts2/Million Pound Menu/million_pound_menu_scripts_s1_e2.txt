 [Darrel] We're looking at putting a lot of money into the absolute best concepts. This is the kind of model that you dream of. If I find the right operator, I'll be fighting for it. [Fred] Each week, the investors will give the people behind two great new food ideas a unique opportunity. Ah, this is brilliant. [Fred] Their own pop-up restaurant. -[dings] -[man] Right. Rock and roll, man. [Fred] They'll have just three days to prove... Nobody seems to know the table numbers. [Fred] ...they've got what it takes... That's a disaster. [Fred] ...to make it on the high street. When you start to rush, that's when you start -to make more mistakes. -[clattering] There's a big backlog of customers at the door. What are you gonna do about it? If I was to invest, it'll take half a million to £750,000. Time to make some dough. [Fred] After the three days, will the investors walk back into the restaurants... [deep sigh] [Fred] ...and make them and offer? It's a £600,000 lunch. We are not gonna leave without an investment. I'm sorry. The time is up. The doors are open for business. Welcome to Million Pound Menu. [Fred] Every year, we spend over thirty-three billion pound in the UK, eating out. No wonder the investors are looking for the next big thing. A new idea could make them a fortune. [narrator] Times might be challenging on the high street, but chains based on strong, simple concepts are still making money in towns and cities across the UK. So what is the next big idea to get us queuing for a table? Well, we might be about to find out. Hi, I'm Paul Mason, I'm the founder of the Fruit Tailor. [narrator] The men and women behind some of the most successful businesses on the high street... At the end of day, what you do get is a truly delicious cheese toasty. [narrator] ...have met to hear ideas from the next generation of restaurant entrepreneurs... You know, we do wanna be the best. To make the best burger they've ever had, [narrator] ...who think their concept is worth big money. There's an explosion of these... these concepts. They're really successful. [narrator] Over 400 people competed for the chance to run a trial pop-up, to prove their idea was worth investment. Conceptually, it's very simple to do, it's very Instagramable. [narrator] The panel chose the two ideas with the strongest food, brand, and business plan. FINCA is a Cuban street food concept based in Liverpool, which has been trading there for the past 18 months. [narrator] The first idea to be selected, a group of friends, who think Britain's high street is ready for a Cuban food revolution. [man] The reason why we chose Cuban street food, is because we believe it's a cuisine that hasn't really been delved into. There's also a huge opportunity for drink sales in our restaurant. We have trialed our Cuban cocktail menu at some of the pop-up events that we've done. It has been very, very successful. [narrator] The young team at FINCA are asking for £150,000 to open their first, proper place. I think this business is very much of the moment. Great team, great brand, great product. [Lydia] I think they're fantastic. Such a cool new concept. In Berlin, we've got this rooftop bar on top of our hotel to roam there which I think would just be amazing. I couldn't see a Cuban surname in the four owners. They looked authentic. They also did say their take on Cuban food. Just raising a point. They've got a great brand, they seem incredibly passionate. There was nothing I saw that didn't tick pretty much all the boxes. Food offer's really strong. It screams fun, and I'd love to see it in Manchester. My name is Jeremy Roberts, I am the CEO of Living Ventures, which is a group of 45 or so restaurants. FINCA excites me. It's... It's sexy. I think it's a great name. That gives you a huge amount of potential for the... the booze side of things, the bar element to it. I think this has definitely got the opportunity to be a national brand, you know, in 10, 15 sites across the UK, unquestionably. My name's Darrel, I'm a partner at Imbiba. We're ultimately looking to build these businesses to 10, 15 units. And that requires investment of up to five, six, seven million. If there's a chemistry, if there's a spark there, we will push you hard. Hi, my name's Chelsea. And I love, love, love, love, food. [narrator] Next, a 27-year old who wants to sell vegan food that appeals to everyone. [Chelsea] Wholesome Junkies is vegan junk food with a wholesome taste. It is an exciting new way of looking at eating vegan food. [narrator] Chelsea's after £95,000 to start her first restaurant. [Chelsea] I want to take Wholesome Junkies to the next level and that means having my own unit, and to work with a really nice big, lovely team Thank you so much for watching. And I really hope you share the same vision as I see. [Lydia] I thought she was super enthusiastic, which is great, but I have to say that I thought the branding sucked. I'm trying to think of somebody who'd want to go and have an unhealthy, fried, but a vegan food. I don't mind the idea of vegan junk food. My name's Chris Miller. She's trying to do vegan junk food. The junk food burger market in the UK is a three billion pound market. So, if she can take a fraction of that market, then it will be a very exciting investment opportunity. I'd like to be able to see one of these in every university, town across the UK. [narrator] The ideas have been chosen. There's just one person interested in Wholesome Junkies. But four investors could end up fighting over FINCA. [Fred] Wholesome Junkies and FINCA are open today for business in Manchester. They are here to prove they've got what it takes to take over the high street. Get it right, and they could secure an investment that will change their lives forever. [narrator] The two ideas will take over identical existing restaurant sites, just 100 yards apart. Today, Chelsea, and the FINCA team are about to see their new restaurants for the first time. [Joe] This opportunity's absolutely huge. We're gonna be meeting some of the biggest investors in the UK. Looking good, that. Nice menu, that. -Let's get going. -Let's do it. Hey-yo. Yes, laddie. [narrator] Over the last month, they've been working with a designer to bring their restaurant to life. [chuckling] This is class. This is superb. We're not gonna stop fighting for this. We're gonna work as hard as we can to make sure that everything goes well. This opportunity is huge, and if we get there, that'll be amazing. Yeah. No, not "if we get there," when we get there. [narrator] FINCA was born 18 months ago. as a Cuban-inspired pop-up in Liverpool. I'm Joe. Uh, I look after the PR and marketing. And I will buzz for you when it's ready. Hi, I'm Michael, I'm one of the directors here at FINCA. I also help plan the food, the menus. My name is Oli, and I'm also the head chef alongside Michael. [narrator] Thirty-four-year-old Michael went on holiday to Cuba, and fell in love with the food. A lot of people come, they've never tried Cuban food before. Hi, guys. [Joe] It's nice when they come back. and say they like, "The food, "it changed my life." [laughing] Would love to get the first FINCA open. But we're ambitious, so we're looking at five FINCAs in the first five years. [narrator] Opposite FINCA, Manchester local, Chelsea, is also about to see her restaurant for the first time. Being here, and doing this is the most exciting thing I've ever done in my life. Oh, I love it. I'm a bit of a tree hugger. [laughing] So... Perfect. An actual kitchen. I'm used to working off this. [Fred] After ten years of working front of housing restaurants, Chelsea took a gamble last year, and set-up a vegan food stall. [Chelsea] The first event that I did, I did really, really well that I thought, "This is easy, this is how it works." No. The next five markets, I had nothing, I lost money, I carried on and persevered. I'm finally getting there now where I'm making good money on each event. [narrator] There are now nearly two million vegans and vegetarians in the UK. Chelsea wants £95,000 to set up a restaurant to help her capture the market. Veganism is becoming really popular, and it's sort of peaking at the moment. And it was now or never, really. It was either miss the boat, or catch the wave. Tomorrow, in just 24 hours, the investors will be arriving for lunch. We need to get started, like, ASAP, because there's quite a bit to do. [narrator] So this evening, both restaurants will open to the Manchester public for their one and only practice run. Tonight will be their soft launch. They will be serving real customers at just half the price. It's a standard industry practice, and it's their one chance to get it right before the investors come. The bag's here. [narrator] Both restaurants have brought their own teams to help in the kitchen, and with front-of-house. including Chelsea's best friend, Faye. When she first made me, like, try something, I was like, Uh... And then I was like, "Oh, my God, mate, this is amazing!" [all greeting each other] [Fred] How are you? So, you're talking about a healthy, junk, vegan food. -Yes. -Isn't it a contradiction? Yeah, exactly. It's a little bit whacky, which kinda just goes with me. So it's a little bit of what everybody loves, the naughty food, the fried foods, but sort of making it a little bit healthy at the same time. What is the actual USP of your... of your brand? The demand for meat can't keep up with the population that's every growing, so we need to find new ways to be sustainable. I mean, I love meat. -[Chelsea] Yeah. -Would I love your food? I reckon we'll win you over, Fred. -Yeah? -[laughing] Yeah. All right. Listen, good luck. -Enjoy. Bye-bye. See you later. -[Chelsea] Thank you so much. Thank you. -Thank you, Fred. -[Faye] Bye. Can you slice the apples into wedges, please? [narrator] Almost a third of the UK say they ate less meat last year. So, Chelsea's hoping her junk food approach has mass appeal. [Chelsea] So I need 'em about a centimeter thick. [narrator] Her shrooms, breaded mushrooms, sell for £5,00 and super sprouts with Parmesan and aioli sell for £3,00 a dish. but for £6,50, you could have a bite of her bestseller. This one dish that I could get the investment on is my battered cauliflower burger. It's called no-plucky fried chicken, 'cause no chickens are harmed. And it's, uh, definitely the most popular dish. Hello, how are you? -Hey. How are we? -Hello. I'm Fred. -Good. -I'm Joe. Nice to meet you, Joe. How are you? -Bonjour. -[Fred] I have no idea what Cuban food is. I mean, I know Fidel Castro, I love Cuban cigars, I have no idea what to expect. It's very centered around the Cuban sandwich, the Cubano. So, is it like the ham and cheeseburger in France? It's got the, um, gammon, and pork shoulder. Ah! It's got gammon as well. So it is like the ham and cheese. Well, look, I can't wait to try the food. And I've got some very, very good news. We don't have one, or two, or three, -but four, four investors... -Yeah? -[Joe] What good, that. -...really interested in your concept. -Amazing. -So, tomorrow they'll be here. -I'm nervous now, though. -[laughter] -[Fred] Good. -Kicking in. Kicking in. [Fred] Enjoy. -Thank you, see you later. -Bye-bye. -Come on. -[Michael] Let's back to work. Yeah, yeah, let's get cracking now. Come on. [narrator] FINCA's menu features a range of Central American delicacies. Their twice-fried plantain fritters sell for £4,00. Their Cuban fried chicken with picked watermelon is £7,00. Their signature dish, the Cubano, is a thick, grilled sandwich that Cubans love. It's £7,00. [Michael] It does take a bit of time in the building of it, and the cooking time, so, I reckon that's probably the most challenging. [woman] So who's in charge of that? Me. [laughs] [narrator] It's 6:00 p.m. In an hour, FINCA, and Wholesome Junkies will open as restaurants for the first time. We are about to open the doors. Um, are we all excited? -[man] Yes. -Are you excited? I am nearly excited. [all laughing] In my own restaurant, I love that feeling before service. It's the anticipation. Everything must be ready. Once the first customers walk through the door, the battle is on. [man] Hello there. Is it Charlotte? [Charlotte] It's me, yes. The server's gonna take you to the table now, show you where to go. [narrator] With food at half price, tonight's soft launch is popular. So, both restaurants face two full sittings. First check's on. It's all go. The sweet potato fries. Tostones, FINCA fries, and then empanadas? Good stuff. [narrator] Half an hour in, FINCA are at full stretch. One veg Cubano, one meat Cubano, three portions of fries... Cubano and tostones, please, mate. Just been icy at the first few orders out and just get in a bit of rhythm of things like that. [woman] The sweet potato fries are possibly the nicest sweet potato fries I've ever had. It's really good. It's really tasty and interesting with lots of new flavors. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and it's massive, but it's really, really delicious. -Wow, what an atmosphere. -[Joe] I know. [Fred] This is full. -[Joe] What can I get for you, Fred? -I must try your, -er, Cubanos. -Thank you very much. Thank you. We've got one sea bass, one Cubano sweet potato fries, some croquetas, and empanadas, please. Chased our tail a little bit, but it's soft launch, so it's how we thought it'd be. Hey, check on, we've got one Cubano, one sea bass, one fries... [Joe] Is table two ready to go? [Oli] One Cubano, and each one sea bass, and each one sweet potato fries and each one croquetas... And then we have, uh, cha-cha-cha. Do you know how long my food is going to be, please? Yeah, it won't be too much longer. Fred's next up, isn't he, Oli? [Oli] Yeah, I'll take, er, two minutes. -Two minutes. -Thank you very much. Thank you. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. The thing that worries me is that the service is slow. The food takes a long time to come out of the kitchen. I've ordered Cubanos, and I still haven't got it. [Michael] This Cubano's done. It'll be 30 seconds. [bell dings] At last. [Fred] The food is absolutely delicious at FINCA. Very good. The thing is, it took at least 15 minutes for me to get my Cubanos, which is basically a ham and cheese sandwich. I really don't understand how this can be possible. They've got so many staff in there. Their staff ratio is just as high as the Ritz. How are they gonna do that in the high street? [Chelsea] Everything altogether, yeah? Okay, perfect. [narrator] At Wholesome Junkies, the half price offer is also drawing in the customers. The chips, you can use, the end ones are gluten-free. I'm a bit just sort of, in shock, I think. Everyone's coming in, and they're ordering one of everything, -So, what, two covers in, uh, ten orders. -[laughs] [narrator] And Chelsea's got a problem just ten minutes into service. I will have to go, Faye. -You have to go? -I have to go. [narrator] Anna, who's in-charge of starters, has to leave. Her boyfriend's been rushed to hospital. [indistinct chatter] Go. Go, go, go. [narrator] So, Faye will have to take her place. [Faye] I mean, I feel like I can do this. Yeah, you're on that. Yeah, you need some parmesan on the side. Chelsea's unlucky. One of the chefs had to go home. I'm afraid this is the reality of the restaurant business. You never know what's going to happen. This is a real test for Chelsea. How well can she cope with struggle? [Chelsea] Oh shit, the, uh, fires are off. One minute. The fire's off. Er, yeah. I'm fine. [Faye] Have we got the sprouts and the fries? No? Sprouts are in, fries, just waiting for electricity. You are booked in for... What time? Now. Um, we are running a little bit behind. Um, hi there, guys, um, we are running a little bit behind. Yeah, mate, don't cry. -No, I'm not. -No. [Chelsea] I'm not. [Faye] Yeah. Don't. [narrator] Despite the wait, the meat-free food is a hit when it reaches the tables. This is so, so tasty. You're not thinking that you're eating vegan food. It's just so nice. You'd never think this was vegetarian, uh, vegan. Never. No. You'd think there was actually meat in it. [indistinct chatter] [Fred] Excuse me? [man] Yes? Do you know what's happening with all these people? -They're all waiting, or... -Yeah, they're all waiting. [Fred] So how many more people have you got? It's five tables. Five tables? Chelsea, I'm sorry to trouble you. I'm sure you've seen there's a big backlog -of customers at the door. -[Chelsea] Yeah, yeah, yeah. What are you gonna do about it? I was just sort of explaining to everybody coming in that I'm having a little bit of trouble in the kitchen. And just check with them, see if they're okay to wait a little bit. I'll leave it with you. [Fred] Right now, in Wholesome Junkies, it's mayhem. Customers are coming in, people don't get served, the food doesn't get out of the kitchen. In restaurant terms, this is called going down. And Chelsea has gone down. There're a few things that she could do. She could, for example, offer take away to the people who are waiting, she could reduce her menu, she could stop serving dessert. What I want to know is if she's going to take any actions. Everyone's who's finished, I'm really sorry, guys, we need the tables back. I'll get you a bill. -Oh, yeah. -Was the food okay, though? If it's more than two hours, just be really polite, say we've got a queue. [narrator] Slowly, but surely, Chelsea's plan to turn the tables starts to work. Thank you so much for waiting. [Faye] It would have been me and Chelsea alone [laughing] if, like, it went smooth sailing. [laughing] But hopefully, everyone's had a nice time. It's the morning after the night before. Wholesome Junkies and FINCA are recovering after a bruising service, but there is no time to relax. In just about three hours time, the people who could change their life are coming to lunch. Good morning, guys. So, are you ready for today? Just getting set now, yeah. You've got four of the biggest investors coming for lunch today. It's not about getting one offer. -What you need to start is a bidding war. -Yeah. And you can go for the best offer. -I don't think we really thought about it. -[laughter] [exhales] My heart's beating. Wanna feel my heart? Yeah? Bup-bup-bup-bup. All right. Good luck, guys. See you later. -Thanks a lot. Catch you later. -Some pressure now, ain't it? [laughing] [Oli] Get them pitching to us. Imagine that. Ha! [narrator] Over the next two days, the investors will test the restaurant's business plans in service. But today's private lunch is all about one thing. The food. First to arrive, two of the main partners of investment group, Imbiba, Darrel Connell, and Simon Wheeler. They've invested over £50 million pounds in Handpicked Partners. The biggest part of any investment decision for us at Imbiba is the quality of the team that we are backing to execute on the business plan. The FINCA concept, and the FINCA brand, there's something special there. The question is whether that can translate into a real business that can be on the high street. [narrator] Joining them, Lydia Forte of luxury hotel group, Rocco Forte. It's her job to develop new bar and restaurant ideas for the five star business. Realistically, you could easily spend up to half a million, uh, doing a site, and launching it. If the quality isn't there, it's gonna be really difficult to commit the funds that we need to commit to it. [narrator] Next, Tim Gee, a property developer, Allied London, Their inner city developments cost hundreds of millions of pounds. You can't just build boring boxes anymore if you want to be a successful property developer. You've got to actually put the heart and soul into it. As important as any part of any property development in any district, is making sure that you give people places they want go, and eat and drink. [narrator] And finally, Jeremy Roberts. CEO of Living Ventures. His string of businesses features cocktail bars as well as restaurants. Bar element's important, because it adds a certain level of excitement, it gives you another strength to the boat. Uh, people coming for a meal, are coming for a meal, they come for a few drinks first or a few drinks after, then... then you've got a really wide range of opportunity to increase revenue. It's always great to see a business that's got an equal focus. [Lydia] I love the idea of FINCA that is cocktails and food. It's a great, really lively atmosphere, attracting a younger audience. [Darrel] Great ideas come from great entrepreneurs across the country. FINCA look like they've... they've captured something very special, and I really can't wait to see that the product lives up to the quality of the proposition. -Hi. -Hello. -How you doing? -Hello, I'm Joe. Let's get this, er, nice big table there. Um, we've got the... the food menus here. -Couple of drinks menu here for you guys. -Thank you. I'll let you guys have a look, and I'll, uh, be back to get your drinks. -All right. -Cheers. Thank you. [Lydia] So I was hoping that there was gonna be cocktails on here. [Jeremy] So did I. I mean, that's exactly the same thing... Hey, guys, can I get some, uh, drinks orders? Not getting cocktails today, then? I'm afraid not today. No, no. Erm... Just, just, er... wanted to get... Well... It was... It was a lot safer. -But it is part of the final concept? -It's a huge part. It's a huge part. I think on the food side-- Yeah, we kinda wanna try everything. -[Lydia] Yeah. -So you wanna go for a... One of everything, yeah? I like their t-shirts. Yeah, I think the image is, just generally speaking, is very, very good. This, this feels... feels real at the moment, yeah? Just wanna go, get everything right. [narrator] On FINCA's menu today, their signature Cubano, Cuban fried chicken with pickled watermelon, and spring onion croquetas. So, guys, we've got the croquetas. [Darrel] For a new food concept, people need to be blown away. Mediocrity is not good enough. [crunch] [narrator] In Wholesome Junkies, Chelsea's perfecting her dishes. No, that's great, guys, let's not worry about it. Yeah, okay. [narrator] And she's hoping today might be the next step in her dream to be her own boss. I was an only child up until about, sort of, 15. And then I've got a couple of half brothers and sisters now. Learned to be very independent from a young age. But I've never been content with working for somebody else. I've always wanted to do my own thing. And then I realized, I'll do what I love and that's cooking. I know how to be really creative, and if I could combine the two together, then I'm gonna be onto a winner, because that's me. [laughs] -You can do it. Okay? -[sighs] Yeah. -Right. We're gonna smash it, right? -Yeah. [narrator] Chelsea's one shot at investment rides on Chris Miller. He runs the White Rabbit investment vehicle. This multi million pound fund has backed four new ideas in the last year. [Chris] Having the best quality product does not mean you're gonna make the most successful business. In fact, the ability for the management team, and the founder to actually scale that business is almost as important as the food. There are many places that I absolutely love for the quality, but the management team just hasn't been able to execute a roll-out plan. So, backing the right person is fundamental to an investment decision. -Hello. Hi. -Hello. Hi. -Chris. -Nice to meet you, Chris. My hands have got very soggy. Er, that's all right. [laughs] -Took my glove off as well. -Don't worry. -How are you? -A little bit nervous. -But good nervous though. -Good. I'll give you a little tour. -Yes, please. -Just start you around, so, -yeah, this is me. -This is you? [laughing] This is me, like, if I could put myself in art form. -Yeah. -I mean I'm already half-way there with the hair, and the flowers... [Chris] And the... the ears. This is like a permanent addition to my -everyday attire. [laughing] -Okay. And then I made a lot of things like this as well, which I just absolutely love. [narrator] Chelsea's chosen to serve Chris three starters. Mac and cheese balls with a cashew nut sauce, her fried sprouts, and then breaded mushrooms. [Chris] I'm so excited for the concept. I don't think she should be looking at the vegan-vegetarian market. I think her competitor should be McDonald's, or Byron, or GBK. But the food has gotta be great. [Chris] Had a taste of everything. -So the crispy mushrooms-- -Yeah? -...is a brilliant dish. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That is phenomenal, and, um... I could see that doing very well. The sprouts is definitely something in there. Yeah, yeah. The mac and cheese ball, -bit too stodgy for me. -Yeah, yeah. So let's get some, uh, mains on the go for you. [narrator] For mains, Chelsea is serving her signature battered cauliflower burger. [Chris] This is the star dish. Her hero dish is her burger. and in reality, if you put a burger onto any menu, that would be the biggest selling item. So, if that first burger is great, it'll be a pretty quick yes from me. -Enjoy. -Thank you. [narrator] In FINCA, the investors have a verdict. That's excellent, isn't it? Well, I thought about all the component parts, the bread's right, the pickles are right, the meat's good quality. It's absolutely delicious. It's really, really good. What they've come up with is really, really interesting, and really good, and tasty, but I just wonder if -is it Cuban? -[exhales] [Darrel] 'Cause to me, this isn't obviously Cuban, this isn't the kinda... -This is a different thing. -Cuban-inspired, as they said. Maybe this is the best way for Cuban food to be. Not, er, Cuban, but yeah, yummy. [Lydia] Joe, you do all the marketing side and the branding and everything. And what... What are your main roles, and-- Chef role. We play the part of creating the food. So when you open your first restaurant, and you've got a general manager. Who do they report to? Who's looking after... We're, sort of, ready to take on them roles ourselves if it needs be. You can tell that they enjoy working together. And that they've come up with a great idea, and they believe in themselves. [Jeremy] The Cubano sandwich, certainly very tasty, but I think the surprise for me were some of the, er, the peripheral dishes which, um, which I wouldn't have expected to be as good as they were, which is a really good sign. I think it needs more drinks. For whatever reason, they only had beer, but it will actually do really well with cocktails. And certainly, if I was to invest, I could help them with that. The food, from a consumer proposition, is strong enough. It's definitely got the scalability, it's got the dynamism about it. As a team, they clearly get on with each other, they enjoy each other's company, but it's just not clear who's gonna be in-charge of operations, who's the real leader. [Lydia] Normally, when I look at doing a concept, I really do want it to be authentic. I want it to mean that it has a history, and, you know, the chef has an understanding of the culture. So, I'm just a little bit worried that this isn't actually a Cuban sandwich, and some Caribbean, and some Latin American dishes thrown in. [Chris] The crunch to this, is better than most fried chicken that I've had. It falls apart great. And very tasty. Yeah, it's a great dish. I just realized I'm probably giving you everything fried on the menu. Should've given you something else. I think that's... My... That so far is some really exceptional parts of it. Yeah, yeah. It's about balancing it out. It feels quite heavy. By virtue of it being vegan, I think having a... Um, a couple of dishes which do feel a little bit healthier... Yeah. I think she's great. Uh, she's... She's got a hell of a lot of character. There were a couple of exceptional dishes in there. The fried mushroom was... was brilliant. There's one thing, Vegan food already has quite a stigma of the kind of hippy... hippy lifestyle around it. I'm not sure her tie-dye uniforms really help that. But I think there could be a very interesting lifestyle brand in there. [Chris] I think you've got a lot of potential. So, yeah. -[Chelsea] Thank you. -Thanks very much for lunch. I think she's... she's quite happily doing a nice, local, vegan restaurant. Amazing. Thank you so much, Chris. But it should be going up against a McDonald's as a choice once or twice a week, and we just need to help it a bit with that. -Oh, man! -I don't know. How was it? -That was really positive. -Ugh! -How can you not think that that was positive? -[exclaims] Ah! -Come here. -[exclaiming] [both laughing] [narrator] Tomorrow lunch-time, the pressure continues. The investors will get to see how well the restaurants cope when they're full of paying customers. But today isn't over. Chelsea and the FINCA team still have private meetings with the investors... How are you, guys? ...to talk business later this evening. You have four business plan meetings. You've gotta perform in each and every one of them. -Yeah. -[Joe] We need to get in our zone now, don't we? And get our heads back... back into our business plans, and we've got the figures where we think they should be, and we've got the... the concept where we think we should be. [Fred] Who's gonna do most of the talking? [Michael] That'd be Joe. -[laughing] -[Joe] All three of us will be chipping in, and, uh... It's gonna be like going to 12 rounds with Anthony Joshua, no? [all laughing] I wish you all the best. Really proud of you, and really... Really excited for you. I can't wait to see what happens. See you later. Take care. -Thanks a lot. Bye. -See you later. Bye. [narrator] 5:30. Chelsea's meeting is first. Five minutes. Let's go. [narrator] Chris has one hour to grill her on every aspect of her operation, and to see if they can make an all-important connection. In this business, 50% of what you're backing is... is the food. -Good to see you -Non-sweaty hand now. -[laughing] -Right. And about 50% of it is the person. From what I saw today, and... How do I put this? -Um-- -Nice. [laughing] But nicely crazy-- [laughing] But my fear is the stigma of vegan, vegetarian restaurants. Yeah. There's this, sort of, hippy, lentils... Yeah. And would you be open to I guess, making it more accessible to... to people who aren't vegans or vegetarians already. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So branding is one thing. On the menu, it's a bit rough around the edges at the moment. -Yeah. -Um... It can't all be fried. There's gotta be a slightly more of... a few more levels on the menu. [narrator] During the meeting, the investors can choose to spell out the offer they'll make if, and only if they decide to invest. Should tomorrow impress, the offer would be closer to, um, -spending time on the branding... -Yeah. Getting you in with my development chefs, to actually help you structure that menu to do it en masse with the ultimate goal of putting it into a standalone site, that will be way more than the money that you've asked for, it would be closer to £400,000. -There's a lot of work to be done. -Mmm-hmm. But I do think there could be something quite interesting in this... -Okay. -...if it's packaged right. -Interesting. -Without tie-dye. [Chelsea laughing] [Chris] She's a bit rough around the edges. The business acumen needs a bit of work. But it's got potential to turn into something... Into something big. He just said that it's gonna need about £400,000 investment, which is just like next level crazy. This meeting tomorrow is a hell of a lot scarier because it needs to be shipshape perfect. [narrator] Now, it's FINCA's turn. As all four investors see FINCA as a serious business opportunity, they'll each have their own hour alone with Oli, Joe and Michael. The boys are asking for a £150,000 investment. My biggest concern, personally, is the authenticity of the concept. Yeah, it isn't authentic Cuban street food, 'cause we're not Cuban. Um... We were inspired by them, ultimately, we were inspired by the place, you know, -inspired by the food. -But you've been to Cuba once ten years ago, -you guys haven't. -Mmm-hmm. None of you are Cuban. Perhaps, um, you know, addressing that once we get more of a full time... Well, not full-time operation, but a bigger operation-- Or even if it's you guys, um, going to Cuba. Yeah. When I do something in one of our hotels, I always want it to be the best possible version of that cuisine. And so, it's... It's hard for me to sell a concept which is Cuban-inspired, but there's no real story behind it. [Lydia] The problem is the authenticity of the Cuban-inspired concept. If I'm going to be totally honest, after today, I think that you're gonna have a great future, but I think, maybe, it's not the best thing for us. Okay, that's fair enough. [Lydia] Going into the meeting with them, I wanted to give them a chance to tell me that there was a little bit more depth to the Cuban inspiration, um, and it just... Yeah, it was clear that there really wasn't, and I think, that was the moment when I thought, better let them move on. It was a major blow, like, you know, we were going in there, being really positive and then it was a bit of a, like, comeback to answer with, and reality check. [narrator] Lydia Forte has pulled out. The other investors have strong views, too. Um, first thing I'd like to say is, um, yeah, food wise, I thought it was really good. What I was displeased about was it kind of just feels to me like it's crying out for cocktails. There was a reason behind deciding to leave them off the menu today. Erm, mainly due to the fact that we... That it's not an area we are directly experienced in. In terms of profitability, yeah, bars are more profitable, because you don't need as many people to deliver the product. A plate of food needs chefs, it needs waiters. A bar, you really only need a bartender. Simple economics. To me, the most directly comparable brand in the market is Turtle Bay. They've got a huge bar area, and it's full of students, spending boat loads of money on cocktails. Yeah, we probably should have gone bigger on that side on the business plan to get that across. You know, it's gotta be really important, upfront and center in your brand. Yeah. So who's the boss? Um, I guess we all take control of our different areas. -Mmm-hmm. -It might sound a bit of a... Cop-out. When you're leading a business, you need someone to lead it. And at some point in time, you have to decide who that person is. -Yeah. -[Joe] Yeah. 'Cause it can't be all three of you. So, you're obviously committing a lot of your time, but what are you planning to invest in that first permanent unit? We're willing to look at raising finance individually, aren't we, if we're needed to. You know, we've spoke about this before this process started, like, could that be something that might come up. I think, from our perspective, once you've got confidence in the people, the next level of reassurance we expect to see is actually, you're putting your money where your mouth is. [Joe] Yes. [narrator] At the end of their session, it's the investors' turn to lay out their potential offers. The flaw in the plan at the minute, for the first project is that your budget's too small to hit the potential to include the drinks. It's probably two and half to three times lower than it needs to be. In their business plan, they're asking for £150,000. What they need, based on the evidence I've had so far, it probably needs around a half a million. We would offer a restaurant, a space for you to open your restaurant within our estate. -We would assist, obviously, with the fit out and build... -Yeah. ...and initial overheads. -That's how we would like to invest. -Mmm-hmm. [Tim] Tomorrow's service is incredibly important. Tomorrow illustrates their ability to... to run a restaurant. So, we need to see it well-managed. It's key. It's a make or break seeing them in that environment tomorrow. [narrator] And finally, Imbiba's vision for FINCA. In the event we do decide to make an investment, it would be larger than what is in here. Somewhere in the region of £250,000 to £300,000. I think the other thing to add to that is this is the case of, all right, we're really getting behind you with the full might of Imbiba. And trying to grow this, and make it a national brand. We do not see this as a one restaurant business. [Darrel] It's very, very important tomorrow. The number one thing I'll be looking at, how are the customers reacting, how are the guys reacting to a busy restaurant? This... It's been a long couple of days, hasn't it? And that is just madness. Potentially three... Three offers coming in tomorrow. We've got another day to go. We've got to impress them tomorrow. [laughs] -Well, it's good. It is. -Yeah. I think so. It's the final day for Wholesome Junkies, and FINCA. They are now getting ready for their last service in a fully booked restaurant. The investors will be watching their every move. [narrator] There are nearly 700 restaurants in Manchester. Today, two more are open for lunch. [Michael] Today is back on to reality. Back to work, and, you know, we gotta impress these people again. [narrator] Two nights ago, the Cubano slowed down service. So, Michael's getting everything prepped and ready. [Oli] Essentially, the biggest meal that we've ever had to cook. We'll just... We'll be over the moon if we got this investment. [Fred] How are you? [Chelsea] Hi, Fred. -Are you okay, Chelsea? -[Chelsea] I'm good. -Hi, guys, how are you? -[all staff greeting] [Fred] How did it go with Chris yesterday? Um, he said some good points yesterday that I took on board. One thing was the tie-dye, lose the tie-dye. He said it's got a bad stigma, it's too hippy. So, I went straight out, I bought all new T-shirts. We're gonna change the restaurant slightly, just strip it back. [Fred] Yeah, I agree with that. [Chelsea] A bit more casual dining. [Fred] Simple. [Chelsea] Simple. And also, he said that he could probably do with a bit more variety on the menu. Maybe a little less fried food options. So, last night I went out, and we've got three new specials on and a dessert for him, that are all non-fried, just to show him what we can do. Um, a bit of versatility, a bit of on-the-spot thinking. Well, but you know that everything is down to that lunch today. -[Chelsea] Everything. -You've got three hours to prove him what you can do. Yeah, we're on it. -Good luck. -Thank you. -Good luck, guys. -Thank you. Bye. See you later. Let's do this. Team Junkies! -[applause] -Whoo! [chuckles] [narrator] 12:30. Lunch time. [Joe] Hello, is it Victoria? -[woman] Yes, it is. -Yeah, good stuff. Come with me. [narrator] And FINCA is open. Cubano, CFC, empanadas, and croqueta. I'm in the zone. I'm in the zone. [narrator] The investors will expect to see a front of the house operation as convincing as the food. Jeremy Roberts is first in. Hello, Jeremy, how is it going? Are you okay? [Jeremy] The conclusion that I came to last night, was essentially that the investment that the guys are looking for is not what it's gonna take to get a first restaurant going. To their flaw, the risk profile goes up. [narrator] Next, Imbiba. Third partner, Fraser Bradshaw has joined them. The full board needs to be together to agree a major deal. Yeah, we're still good. Thank you. Yesterday, we had a very good day. The guys really delivered. But it was a small, dining environment. Today, busy, bustling restaurant. It's all to play for. [narrator] And finally, Allied London's Tim Gee. [Michael] Veg Cubano, no pickle, one sea bass, one sweet potato fries. Hello. How are we? -Are you waiting to be seated? -Yes, I am. Fantastic. Very sorry. -What's your, uh... What's your name? -Tim. [man] Uh, drinks menu? I'll probably go with a Diet Coke actually, and can I get some tap water as well? -Tap water as well. No problem. -Thank you. -And the menu's just there. -Yeah. Thanks. [narrator] Chris Miller's booked in at Wholesome Junkies. [Chelsea] Hello, Chris. It's Chelsea's last chance to impress. I hope you've noticed we've kinda stripped everything back to sort of how it would be, and it looks so much better as well. [Chris] Yeah. [Chelsea] So, I'll send the dish over to you. -Thanks very much. -No problem. [Chris] The colorful, floral table-cloths have disappeared. And the tie-dye T-shirts are also gone. So, she's definitely taken a few things on board. When we met yesterday, she was very excited, but a little bit silly. In the kitchen, she's clearly actually running the show. I've got your two cheesy balls, and you've got two sprouts there, you've got one Kung Pao here, you've got one more Kung Pao on the way. I wasn't expecting her to be as commanding in the kitchen as... as she clearly is. [narrator] Chelsea's lined Chris up with three dishes, including her new, healthy specials. [Chelsea] Uh, so this is a Mexican chipotle-spiced jack fruit. This is your grilled tandoori cauliflower. Yeah, dig in, see what you think. Thank you very much. [Chris] Yesterday, a lot of it was fried, so it's nice to see a bit of a difference from big burgers. So, the jack fruit salad was a lot fresher, so that was really nice. Same thing with the tandoori cauliflower wings. [narrator] The third dish, cheesy bites. So it's a lump of vegan cheese with bacon frazzles on it. That's a disaster. [narrator] Over at FINCA, the investors' orders have arrived. All right. Nice presentation, Instagram-friendly. Thumping-big eat. Plenty of clean plates. I like the Cubano, boys. What's it like behind there? Okay? Yeah, it's good. It's, uh... Yeah, it's calm. The kitchen's always calm. It feels really calm. Very consistent with yesterday. So the quality was still extremely high. It's good. I'm impressed. [narrator] Half-way through service, Jeremy Roberts moves in for a closer look. Fancy a change of scenery? I'd like a Cubano coming to table one and two as well. [narrator] And there's confusion over an order [Oli] We're missing a Cubano. We're missing one now? Oli? I've got one on. I've got one on the bill right now. -Yeah. -You need it now, yeah? Do we need an extra Cubano over here? -Er, no. -No. Is that all right? I think you should take that off. That's quite interesting seeing how it translates from the street food to the restaurant. And I can see quite a big gap, really. There's no real front of house experience in the team. And that... that's really a shame. And, um, the concerns, you know, are forming slightly in my mind. -See you later. -[woman] Bye-bye. -[Michael] Thanks, Tim. -Thanks, mate. [Tim] It was good. Yeah, there were a few challenges, but that's to be expected. There are few other people involved in the decision-making process who are waiting for my feedback, and we'll take it from there. Thanks, guys, it's great. There's lots that we like, there's lots that needs to be done. It's what they need to do now going forward to go from a pop-up format, very different to actually getting into running a business. And then running a business that scales and then rolls out. And I think we need to go, and have a long conversation about that, just to see how we want to play it going forward. It's been a long three days, ain't it, bud? Hopefully, we get some good news. [narrator] Lunch is over. Thanks for lunch again. Thanks. Good to see you, Chris. Thank you. [narrator] Now the pressure is on the investors. See you. [narrator] They have to decide whether the idea is worth their money. I think that went well. I've looked at 300 restaurants in the last year and a half, and I've only invested in four of them. The pressure now is for me to have a think about where I see her business in the next three, five years' time. [narrator] And Imbiba also have a difficult decision to make, whether FINCA is worth backing to the tune of $400,000. They're a really, really nice team, and I think they have grown in character and in confidence over the last 48 hours. How it gets from where it is now into a restaurant and a roll-out I think there's a lot of missing links that need... That need support. All of that adds up to a lot of investment of time. Do you feel they're in a position where we feel we could move towards and investment? Do you feel they are... Could they roll out to six, seven, eight, nine sites across the country over the next four or five years? That is a big question. -How are you? -Hi, Fred. Oh, you've got a nice smile. -I'm nervous. -Are you? -[chuckles] Yeah. -Well, look. Chris now has a deadline. -Okay. -He has one hour to make you an offer. Wow. Okay. [laughs] If he comes back, he will make you an offer, if he doesn't, then the game is off. This is gonna be the worst hour of my life. [laughs] [narrator] Chelsea came here looking for £95,000. If Chris Miller doesn't return with an offer of investment by 6:30, she'll walk away with nothing. The suspense is killing me. How do you feel? I just want it to be over. [laughing] It... It's... It's, uh... a horrible weekend. [chuckles] But it's not about the hard work only. It's about the opinion of somebody, and whether he believes... [Chelsea] The business... [ticking] -Hello. -[Fred] Chris. You're nearly late. [chuckles] [Chris] Sorry, running a bit behind. Um, how are you? -[Chelsea] I'm good. How are you? -Very well. [Fred] How are you? [Chris] Good. Don't get too excited... [Chelsea] No, I'm not. ...before you hear what I have to say. -Mmm-hmm. -So, can I ask you to give us your offer? Right now, I don't think you are ready to open a 50-seat restaurant. Okay. So, actually, what I would like to offer you is support. I have some extremely talented development chefs. I would like them to work with you. I want you to bring the creativity to it. -Yeah. -But have them support you in turning it into a more complete, -and a more balanced menu. -Polished. Yeah, yeah, yeah. At the same time, I have a branding agency. We can turn it into a brand -that is a bit more accessible to people. -Yeah. And so, that's really the offer. If you're happy, then I'd like some time working together with you, and see where it goes. I would love to. Thank you so much. [Chris] Very welcome. I am super happy. Super, super happy. It's so nice, I have somebody to give me the help and the knowledge that I really, really, really need. There's no value on that. It's just, um... I'm really really happy with it. Is it vegan? It is not vegan. -[Chris laughing] -[Chelsea] Oh, no. [Fred] It is the full fat. Just a few fish guts in there. [laughing] Lovely. That's what is in the wine that makes it non-vegan. There's a lot to learn from my side. I think she's, um... She's got a lot of potential. Uh, there's a lot of raw talent there, that, um, needs to be worked on. Yeah, hopefully we'll end up with something that we can turn into a really great project for the future. -Cheers. -Well done. -Well done, Chelsea. -[Chelsea] Thank you so much. [narrator] Now it's FINCA's turn. They came here looking for £150,000. The deadline is eight o'clock. Will one or more investors walk through the door? [Fred] This is it. God, this will decide what we do with the rest of our lives. Mmm-hmm. [Michael] It's not easy, this. It feels... Um, we just don't know really, you know? [ticking] [Joe] Getting closer. Hello. Here you are. -Hi. Hi, Fred. -[Fred] How are you? -Yeah, I'm very, very well. -How's it going? [Tim] Hi, Joe. -[Fred] Yeah. Yes. -I'm good. [Fred] Tim, we still have about ten minutes. We have to wait until the other investors come if they do come. So, we have ten minutes. [Jeremy] Good evening. -[Fred] How are you? -Doing well. Good to see you. Hello, Jeremy. [Jeremy] Good to see you. [Fred] We're still waiting for one more investor. The clock is still ticking. If we were backing FINCA just to open one single restaurant in Liverpool or Manchester, I'd back them to be a success. But can they run six, seven, eight, nine sites across the UK on a three or four year view, Don't know. We agonized, you know, long and hard over it, we just couldn't get over that final question. Have they got what it takes, in their experience bucket, to do that? We just couldn't get there. [narrator] FINCA will have to choose between two investors. But first, they have to hear what's on the table. Tim, you were the first to come in. Our offer is to set you up in a restaurant, fully kitted out, and it will be FINCA branded, and you will have that for a year, at our cost. Our intention would be to support you with the business to see what could happen next. And then we could see, perhaps, further locations off that. Thank you, Tim. Jeremy, your turn. When I saw you all today, I consolidated my thoughts on the business. It does need to be something of a bit more, um, complete. What I am keen to put on the table is a commitment to £150,000 in order to continue your development so that you are in a position to roll it forward. [narrator] On the table, two offers. From Allied London, a ready-made restaurant premises with costs covered for one year, with potential for further growth. Well, I think you, maybe, have to think about it for a couple of moments. [narrator] And from Jeremy Roberts, an initial investment of £150,000 to develop the FINCA concept, and open their first restaurant. We know which way we're leaning here. [Michael speaking] -[Oli] Yeah. -This... This... -[Oli] Yeah. -[Michael speaking] [Joe] Yeah. [Oli] Yeah. [Joe] Well, good stuff. So, have you made a decision? We have, yeah. Yeah. Let's hear it. [Joe] Um, so thank you for coming down. This is what we came here for. Jeremy, um, I think we'd be a great fit, we'd like to take you up on your offering. -Fantastic. -[Joe] Yeah. Fantastic. Cheers. Thank you. -Well done, guys. Well done. -Thanks a lot. We want someone like Jeremy that believes in FINCA as a concept and a brand. Yeah, enormously. It's not sinking, is it? Do you know, it was a pleasure. [Tim] Congratulations to Jeremy and FINCA. I hate losing, I'll be perfectly honest. But I wish them all the best. Yeah, I'm delighted. I see a real potential in these guys, and I see huge amount of passion. And I think those two things, as I said right at the start, are the most important things. [all cheering] I hope to make some money out of it, bottom line. That's what it's all about. [Joe] Cheers, cheers. [Fred] Cheers. Good luck. I'm blown away. I'm blown away right now. We're ready now. The journey starts. I can't get rid of this stupid grin. [laughing] Got a difficult table over there. [waiter] Are you not feeling the chicken burger? [Atul] I heard that your food didn't go well, so apologies on the house. For you, Ronnie, especially, being a chef and a very confident chef, I felt that you were a little arrogant. [man] I need two fettuccines straight in, Chef. We've got no more cream left. -[woman] What's happened? -Uh, we ran out of white-wine cream [sighing]
