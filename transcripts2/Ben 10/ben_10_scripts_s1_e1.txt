 >> Yeah, right. Yes! Out of here! >> Everyone, have a good vacation, and I hope to see you all again in the fall. Benjamin. Could I have a word with you before you go? >> Normally we'd take your money and beat you up, but since it's the last day of school, we're gonna give you a break. Now, fork over the cash so we can get out of here. >> Leave him alone. >> Get lost, shrimp. >> I said back off. >> Oh, looks like we've got us a hero. Suppose we don't want to back off. What are you gonna do about it, Tennyson? >> Aah! >> Thanks a lot. >> I was just trying to help. >> Next time you want to play hero, make sure you can back it up. >> Come on, Ben. Let's go. We're burning daylight. I want to make it to the campsite by nightfall. >> Uh, Grandpa, a little help here? I've so been looking forward to this. What are you doing here? What is she doing here? >> Take it easy, dweeb. This wasn't my idea. Somebody convinced my mom that going camping for the summer would be a good experience for me. >> Grandpa, please. Tell me you didn't. >> I thought it would be fun if your cousin came along with us this summer. Is that a problem? >> Aw, I can't believe it. I wait all school year to go on this trip, and now the queen of cooties is along for the ride. >> Hey, I had my own vacation already all planned out, too, you know. Each activity is color-coded so I never did the same thing two days in a row. Now I'm stuck with my geekazoid cousin going camping for 3 months. >> Geek. >> Jerk. >> Something tells me it's gonna be a long summer. Chow time. >> OK, I give up. What is that? >> Marinated mealworms. Hard to find them fresh in the states. You know, they're considered a delicacy in some countries. >> And totally gross in others. >> If these don't sound good, I've got some smoked sheep's tongue in the fridge. >> Ugh. Couldn't we just have a burger or something? >> Nonsense. This summer's gonna be an adventure for your taste buds. I'll grab the tongue. >> OK. I've got a half-eaten bag of corn chips and a candy bar in my backpack. What do you got? >> Some rice cakes and hard candy. >> Think we can make them last the whole summer? >> Their propulsion systems have been destroyed. >> Prepare to board. I want the Omnitrix now. >> Who wants to roast marshmallows? OK. Um, how about we tell scary stories? >> Scarier than having to spend a summer with your freak of a cousin? >> I'd like to, grandpa, but I'm busy doing a web search on cures for extreme doofusness. Nothing yet, Ben, but let's not give up hope. >> Oh, come on, you two. We're all in this together. You can mope around like this all summer, or we can have some fun. Now, what do you say? >> I vote for moping. >> I'm gonna take a walk. Smell you around, Gwen. >> I, uh, think they're starting to grow on each other. >> Oh, man, this is gonna be the worst vacation ever. I might as well have gone to summer school. Whoa! A shooting star! Aah! Looks like a satellite or something. Yah! Uhh! A watch? What's a watch doing in outer space? Aah! Get off me! Get off! Get off! Grandpa! >> Hmm. Ben's been gone a while. Well, I guess he can't get into too much trouble out here. >> Unless he wound up bear food. Hey, I can dream, can't i? >> Whoa. Cool! Aah! >> Aah! I'm on fire! I'm on fire! Aah! Hey, I'm on fire, and I'm OK. Check it out. I'm totally hot. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Here goes. That's what I'm talking about. Liking it. Wait, stop! Uh-oh. Oh, man. I am gonna get so busted for this. >> What's that? >> Looks like the start of a forest fire. We better let the ranger station know. Probably some darn fool camper out there messing around with something he shouldn't. Ben. Better take this. >> This would be so cool if it weren't so not cool. Aah! >> Aah! >> Look, I know I look weird, but there's no reason to be scared. Hey! >> I don't know what you are, but you'll stay down there if you know what's good for you. Ow! Aah! I warned you. >> Don't even think about it, freak. >> Ben, is that you? What happened? >> Well, when I was walking, this meteor fell from the sky and almost smushed me, except that it wasn't a meteor or a satellite but this cool watch thing that jumped up onto my wrist. And when I tried to get it off, I suddenly was on fire, only it didn't hurt when I was accidentally starting this mega forest fire. >> Gwen, are you all-- what in blazes? >> Hey, Grandpa, guess who. >> It's me, Grandpa. >> Ben? What happened to you? >> Well, when I was walking, this meteor-- >> Um, excuse me? Major forest fire burning out of control. Remember? >> What do we do? >> Backfire. Start a new fire and let it burn into the old fire. They'll snuff each other out. Think you can do it, Ben? >> Shooting flames I can definitely do. >> What do you mean, it's not there? This battle nearly costs me my life, and you say the Omnitrix is no longer onboard the transport? >> Sensors indicate a probe was jettisoned from the ship just before boarding. It landed on the planet below. >> Go. Bring it to me. >> And you say that this watch just jumped up and clamped on to your wrist? >> Hey, this time it wasn't my fault. I swear. >> I believe you, Ben. >> Think he's gonna stay a monster forever? >> He's not a monster. He's an alien. I--I mean, look at him. What else could he be? >> Yeah, I don't want to be fire guy forever. How am I supposed to play little league this fall if I charcoal the ball every time I catch a pop fly? >> Don't worry, Ben. We'll figure this thing out. >> I'm me again. >> Aw, too bad. I liked you better when you were a briquette. >> I still can't get this thing off. >> Better not fool with it anymore until we know exactly what we're dealing with. I'll go check out that crash site. You guys stay here until I get back. >> I wonder what this does. >> Caught ya! >> Heh heh heh. Very funny... like your face. >> Grandpa said not to mess with that thing. >> Yeah? So, what's your point? >> Did your parents drop you when you were a baby? >> Come on. You can't tell me you aren't a little bit curious what else this thing can do. >> Not in the least. >> You sure you're related to me? >> I don't like this one little bit. >> Look. If I can figure this thing out, maybe I can help people. I mean really help them, not just, you know, make things worse. >> So, what did it feel like going all alien like that? >> It freaked me out at first. It was like I was me, but it was also like I was somebody else. Hey, I think I figured out how I did it. Should I try it again just once? >> I wouldn't. >> No duh. You wouldn't. >> Ew! This thing's even uglier than you are normally. Wow. Put a flea collar on this mutt. And no eyes? What good is this one? It can't see. Uhh! OK. So maybe it's not a total loser. Ew! Two words: breath mints. Ben, get back here! Ben, I'm gonna tell Grandpa that you turned into some freaky animal monster thing and went swinging around the forest when he told you not to. This is a majorly weird day. >> Yes! Oh, not good! >> Uhh! Back off, sparky. No flying tree trimmer is going to hurt my cousin. >> Never thought I'd say this, but am I glad to see you. >> I was worried that you might get popular with that thing on your wrist. That's why I asked you not to fool around with it until we know what the heck it is. >> Sorry, Grandpa. But at least I figured out how to make it work. All you do is press this button. Then when the ring pops up, just twist it until you see the guy you want to be. Slam it down, and bammo! You're one of 10 super-cool alien dudes! >> What about staying a super-cool alien dude and not transforming back into plain old pizza face? >> I kind of haven't figured that part out yet. >> With a device as powerful as that watch clamped on you, my guess is we'd better help you learn fast. >> All right! >> Mayday! Mayday! Somebody help us! We're under attack by some sort of-- I know you're not gonna believe me--but robot. >> Sounds just like those things that attacked me. Must be looking for the watch. Those people are in trouble because of me. I think I can help them. >> Uh, you? What are you gonna do about it, Tennyson? >> Yeah. Eenie meenie minie--here goes. >> So what can this guy do? >> I don't know, but I bet it's gonna be cool. Looks like papa robot this time. I'll get gearhead's attention. You guys get the campers to safety. >> Aah! >> Leave him alone! You want somebody to pick on? Try me. Cool. Uh-oh. I think I'm in trouble. >> What is going on here? >> You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you. Now come on. >> Aah! >> So, we even? >> Even. >> Uh-oh. >> Ben! >> Come on. Burn one in here. >> Get out of there. Run! >> What comes around goes around. Let's see how you like it, you techno freak. >> All right! >> Way to go, Ben... Uh, diamond-headed guy! >> Oh, yeah! Who's bad? Yeah! Well, I think my work here is done. >> Who was that guy? >> Failure? Unbelievable! The puny earth being that is keeping the Omnitrix from me will soon hang on my trophy wall. >> Where's Ben? >> I haven't seen him since breakfast. >> Ben? >> Yep. Hey, check this out. Pretty fast, huh? I think this is gonna be the best summer ever. >> Absolutely. >> It's definitely going to be interesting. So, where'd you go anyway? >> Just had to take care of a couple of things before our vacation really got rolling. >> Dude, how'd we get up here? >> I'm not sure. It all happened so fast. >> Hey, somebody, anybody! Little help up here, please!
