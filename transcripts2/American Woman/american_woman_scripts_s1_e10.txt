All right, give me a minute. Hey, no ordering a third martini without me. - What's going on? - We need money, Steven. Okay. Why didn't you say so? I have, like, uh... I have $120 on me. Maybe you didn't hear me, Steven. But I need money to support your children. Not to buy tacos. You're gonna have to take out your checkbook. If I wrote you a check right now, it would just bounce. Do you know what a mortgage is? Because I have one. And it's way overdue. So I need you to step up now. Look, I wanna help out. I just... I just got back to work. I mean, I still have to pay these legal fees and the fine. And I'm working on this deal together in Culver City. It's a couple hundred apartments. I'm just working on the financing. - Cal Baker is here. - Great. - Kathleen. - Cal. It's nice to see you. I am such a big fan of "Police Woman."

He's taken a bad turn in these last couple days. I'm flying up to San Francisco next week to see him, so... My mom had a health scare recently. I know how hard it can be. I'm sorry, I did not mean to pull you into this. It's fine. Here. [SOFT ROCK MUSIC] We still got a lot of files to get through here. The work can wait a minute. ♪ ♪ Yeah. ♪ ♪ Mom, the bills are changing colors. Hmm? Oh. Oh, God. _ [TOGETHER] Shit. Hey, Mom. Do you know what time we're having dinner? What?

Whoa, what are you doing? What are you doing? - I... I wasn't doing anything. - Okay, yes you were. I was just trying to be nice to you. Jesus. Okay. I thought we were having a moment. Yes, we were. It's called compassion. It's when one person is nice to another person. Maybe you had trouble seeing that because I'm a woman. I'm sorry, but you are a woman, - and I'm a man. - Yes. - And? - It's confusing. Do you want to be treated as our equals, or do you want us to hold open the door for you? Which one? How about both? Is that so impossible? So how are we supposed to know what you want at any goddamn moment? You have no idea how hard it is to be a man these days. How hard it is to be a man? A... Are you serious? You know, try being a woman. Okay? Try working twice as hard for half the recognition and a quarter of the pay. Or see how it feels to be called a bitch for speaking up for what you believe in. Or being told because you have a career, you're never gonna have a family. You... [QUIRKY MUSIC] What... What is it? Where are you going? You promoted Jeff.

Um, I need to talk to you mom for a second, okay? Um, here. Eat a Kit Kat. Okay. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm just fighting for my daughter since you won't do it. Okay, that is unfair. I did everything that I could. I let her read for a part that she's not even right for. I can't force a producer to cast my friend's kid. I'm sorry. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I'm acting like a crazy person. Bonnie. Are you gonna be okay? I don't know. ♪ ♪ - I am so sorry about that. - Oh. Please, I've seen my share of scary stage moms. Thank you for understanding. No, I should be thanking you. You did what my casting director couldn't. You found my actress. I don't need to see anyone else. I'm going with Sophia. I knew you'd love her. I love more than just her. I love the job you did. I want you to cast the rest of my season. The whole show? You can handle that, right? - Yes. - Good, because my guy's putting so much coke up his nose, he's holding casting sessions in his bathroom. Thank you so much. This is wonderful.
