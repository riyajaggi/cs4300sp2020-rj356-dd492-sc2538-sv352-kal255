 Joe doesn't like me, Laura. Because, he was sitting with Gary Sizemore at lunch and I said hi to him and he did not say hi back. Why aren't these done? Mom, her dress won't come off. - Here. - Wait, when did you talk to Joe? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Becca. - Do you think he likes me? - Becca! Wait, really? He did not. Wait, no, he did? He said that?

 Are you kid... Mom! Laura, it's Becca's mom. Does Joe stare at her and tease her and act like a complete moron whenever she's near him? He does? Thank you! Good-bye. Congratulations. Joe likes you. So now you can concentrate on doing your homework after dinner. God, you're embarrassing. Mom, are we having pot roast like Julietta used to make? No, we're having pork chops. Pot roast was Dad's favorite.

 Which is why we're having pork chops. Mom, it smells weird. - Shit! - Oh, my God. Ahh! Gah! Here you go, baby. The pork chops aren't done. Guess we'll just have to have beans. We're having beans for dinner? Do we live in a cartoon? Mom, Julietta never used that because it made the lights go... - What? - Out. Ugh, Mom. What's all this? It's my world history class presentation. It's due tomorrow and I'm not gonna get a good grade because Mr. Knave is out to get me. Oh, Becca, don't make excuses. I'm not making excuses. That's actually the truth. Mr. Knave has nothing to do with this. You put yourself in this predicament. - I knew you'd get mad at me. - I'm not mad at you. No, you are. Ever since Dad left, you're always mad. You're mad at me for talking on the phone, you're mad at me for watching TV, you're mad at me for listening to the radio. You're always mad at me. Sometimes I don't... I don't even know if you like me anymore. Oh, baby. Of course I like you. I love you. You and your sister are the most important people in my life. Aww. Okay, okay. - What do you have so far? - Uh... "Economic Stagnation in Post-War East Germany." I want to do something else, I just can't think of anything. Here. I'll look up some facts about the wall. You read about East Germany. Okay. Thanks for helping me, Mom. Are you having cookies for lunch? Oh. It's the cookie diet. You eat six cookies that are specially made to make you lose weight. It was invented by a doctor in Florida. Then why are you taking a diet pill? Well, a cookie's still a cookie. Now that I'm working at the office, I need a little boost. Kathleen, do you have Alan's number? Oh, my Gosh. Of course. I knew you two were a good match. All right, don't get excited. I left my jacket in his car the other night and I need to get it back. Well, you never know. It starts with him returning the jacket and then sparks fly and you fall in love and suddenly I'm walking down the aisle in a lilac silk chiffon bridesmaid's dress. Oh, God. Does everything end with you in a lilac chiffon dress? Well, if it's a spring wedding, absolutely. Hey. You okay? Uh, yeah. I'm just... I'm really stressed out. I don't know how I'm gonna pay the mortgage this month and I can't even afford to take my girls out to a nice dinner. I tried to cook the other night and I ended up sending Jessica's Barbie to the burn ward. You need to untangle your tingle. I don't know what you're saying. Well, there's an item for ladies and you use it on your area. Oh! Mm-hmm. Hey, baby. Hey, how was lunch with the girls? It was good. Diana's going to be seeing Alan again. - Why? - Well, it's not a real date but I'm still hopeful something will happen. What's the matter? Can't Diana take care of her own personal life without your help? Yes, of course she can. Then why are you getting involved? I'm not involved. I just gave her his number. - Why are you so upset? - Because you won't listen. Okay? Alan is not a good guy. You said that he was your friend. When did he suddenly turn into this horrible person? I just wish that you would stay out of it. Are you that bored? I'm not bored. That is a terrible thing to say to me. Oh... Ka... Shit! Greg! Well, this is a surprise. Can I buy you a drink? - I don't want a drink. - You sure? Just a quick one. Diana call you? Yes. Oh. That's why you're here. You're worried I'm gonna tell her. Now that's kinda funny. I'm only gonna say this once. Don't mess with me and don't mess with my life. Hey. Hi. Come on in. Do you, um... do you want some wine? Only if you're having some. Two house reds coming up. - How've you been? - Great. How about you? Okay. - Just okay? - Yeah. Just okay. What do you think? It's incredible. - You like it? - Very much. I'm glad. I started working on it that night I met you. So am I your muse? You're my inspiration. You'll be my muse when somebody buys it. Hello, again. Alan, hi. Did you have a hard time finding the place? I'm usually the worst at giving directions. No, it was very easy. Here's your jacket. Thank you so much. I feel bad you came all the way down here I could've come and gotten it from you. Don't mention it. I was looking for an excuse to get out of the office today. Can I buy you a drink? As a thank you for coming all the way down here. You don't have to do that. I was gonna get one anyway. There's a place right down the street. We can walk there. Wow. I'm from New York. You're the first person I've met in Los Angeles who suggested walking somewhere. So what do you say? Yeah. - Maybe a quick one. - Okay. So how do you all know each other? - The three of us? - Mm-hmm. Well, I met Kathleen after she moved here from Dallas. And we met Bonnie at a party for my work. Figueroa does business with the real estate company where her husband works. Well, her ex-husband. She's separated. It's not a shock. She's not usually like that. She's just going through a lot right now. It was quite a speech. Another round? Sure, why not? Do you like living in Silverlake? Yes. It's nice. How long have you owned your house? Oh, it's not mine. - I live with my mother. - Oh. My dad died a few years ago, so I moved in to take care of her. That's nice of you. She's my mom. What's she like? Wow. Okay. We're gonna have that conversation. Just in time. Thank you. Mm. Thank you. It's complicated. I mean, I love her, of course. But she drives me insane. All mothers do that. I guess. It's just, she's always interfering with my personal life. And she always thinks she's right. So we argue a lot. - About what? - Everything. Politics, women's lib. We even argued about you. Me? - She doesn't even know me. - Exactly. What did she say? No. It's not even worth bringing up. Oh, no, no. Now you have to tell me. She saw you on the porch, and... God, this is stupid. She saw you on the porch and she said you were a homosexual. Oh, my. Oh... So how did you figure it out? - Uh, that I was gay? - Yeah. It all started with Wally Cleaver. - What? - I couldn't stop thinking about Wally Cleaver from "Leave it to Beaver." - Come on! - It's true. I thought about him all the time. And sometimes I'd kiss the TV. Wow. That sounds romantic. Yeah, well, you can't choose who you love. So if everyone's hiding it, then... how do you meet other... like-minded gentlemen? I've never heard that. Like-minded gentlemen, sounds classy. You know what I mean. I go to bars. What bars? Studio One in the Valley. And there's this place called the Red Target in Hollywood. - The Red Target? - Mm-hmm. I had no idea. Well, why would you? As I said, we keep a pretty low profile. So there's no big, flashing neon sign that says, - "Gay men, meet here." - No. Oh. You know, Diana, if I was attracted to women, I'll bet it would be to someone like you. Gee, Beav, that's sweet of you to say. Hey, Kathleen, this just came by messenger. It's the script from Warner Brothers that we wanted. What script? I don't know what you're talking about. It's the one Roger Payne's producing. Then say the Roger Payne script. How many of those have you taken today? Ah, don't worry about it. Hm. Are you gonna give me that script or are you just gonna stand there? Kathleen. Shut the door when you leave, please. - Are these your kids? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's Becca and Jessica. They're beautiful. Thanks. And your ex-husband? Technically, he's still my husband. We should probably pull the trigger and file for divorce. - What's he like? - Steve? I haven't the slightest idea anymore. What is it? I was just thinking... I haven't told my friends about you. And I tell them everything. Why not? I like the idea of having a secret. I've never had anything in my life that was just mine. Well... I won't tell anybody. Mm, you know that painting I was working on? - The one at your loft? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - It's gonna be in this group show in New York in July. - That's wonderful. - Yeah. Yeah, it's the first time my work is going up in a real gallery. I'm gonna go out there for the summer. I haven't been to New York since I was a girl. You should come. Hang out with me. I can't go to New York with you. Why not? Because I can't leave the girls. They'll be out of school. Steve could take them for a couple weeks. Steve? You're calling him Steve now? Yeah, good, old Steve. Just think about it. Oh, shit! You have to go. The girls are gonna be home soon. Can I stay just a little bit longer? No, I want you to but you can't. Why not? Because my life is more complicated than yours. Well, then you should uncomplicate it. Can you teach me how? I'll try. I threw them out. What? I don't like what those pills are doing to you. Too bad. You don't get to decide what I do. Yes, I do. When it starts to affect us, I do. Oh. Us? There's no us. I don't feel us. All I feel is distance. Why do you keep holding back from me? I'm not. Do you think I'm just bored woman with nothing to offer? That I'm not worth your time? Is that your impression of me? - No. - Then why did you say that? I don't know. I was upset. I was upset about Alan and Diana. I don't know why I said it, but I didn't mean it. If this isn't going to work, then tell me now. If we're not good anymore, then let me go, please. I can't do this anymore. - I don't want to. - No, no, no, no. Don't cry. Things are gonna get better, I promise. I'm gonna be better. I don't know why everyone says that you shouldn't procrastinate because I did and I still got an A. You know no one in class knew that 120 people were murdered trying to cross the Berlin Wall. People got murdered? Oh, don't worry. We're safe over here in this bourgeois Bel Air neighborhood. Mom's gonna be so proud of you. Oh. Becca? How was your presentation? - What? - How was the presentation? It was fine. Well? Tell me. I wanna hear all the details. I'll bet everyone loved it. I guess they did. What did mean, old Mr. Knave say? He said it was well presented. He gave me an A. An A? That's wonderful! What's the matter? I saw him. You saw who? That guy that was leaving our house. Is that why you made Dad leave, so you could be with him? No, Becca. Please. - Let me explain. - Everything about you is fake. The way you act is fake. The things you say. It is all fake. I wish that you were gone and Dad was here. Okay, mm. - Do you want me to do that? - No, I'm banker. Now I lost count. Diana, you be the banker. Thank you very much. I need a cigarette after all that. - I got you, baby. - Aww. - Thank you, honey. - I love you. All right, we have a game to play. Okay. _ Diana? Don't tell me you lost count, too.
