 How long does it take to get to Malibu? I don't want to be late. First of all, there's no such thing as being late in California. Second, you're still in the tub. Don't worry. I can be ready in a snap. I don't know why anyone lives in Malibu. It's so far away from everything, and there's no place to park. This is a big night for me. Lori Meltzner is one of

 the most powerful agents in Hollywood. Getting invited to this party is a very big deal. The last thing I need is you ruining my chances of talking to her by bringing all this negative energy. Don't worry. I'm sure people will be paying so much attention to your amazing personality and your perky tits, they won't even notice me. All right, that's enough. You two are worse than my girls. Kathleen, if you have anything that will calm you down in that armada of pills you're always carrying around with you,

 I suggest you take it. And Diana, you're not dull, but this martyr routine is, so drop it. I haven't been out by myself in years, and I barely scraped together enough money for a babysitter, so I am ready to have a good time. Kathleen, get out of the tub. You're pruning. Hello. I did not know there were this many beautiful people in the world. Kathleen. You look lovely. Thank you. But where's Greg? He couldn't make it. He's in New York. Well, give him my best, if you would. - I will. - Good to see you. Good to see you. Robert Redford's publicist. This party just got 60% more interesting. I told you this was a big deal. If I play my cards right and make a good impression with Lori, then Greg and I go from casting Hot Wheels commercials to casting Spielberg movies. There she is. Aren't you going to go and talk to her? You obviously don't know her reputation. She's a killer. I can't just walk up to her. No, I'll have to find the right moment to make my move. Excuse me. You look familiar. Did we meet at Lori's last party? I... I don't remember. Did we? I think so. I'm Terry. I'm Diana. Ah, right. Diana. You know, I had a couple drinks that night, so I couldn't remember exactly, but I knew it was a D. Would you like to grab a drink? I'd love to. Having a drink with a hot guy I just met. Why? Because I'm fun. So are you an actor? A lawyer. I rep Ryan O'Neal. He's the one who gets me into these parties. - Two vodka gimlets. - You got it. That's glamorous. Yeah, it can be. I've visited Ryan in London a few times while he was filming "Barry Lyndon." Do you know London at all? Oh, I don't get to travel very much. My job keeps me pretty busy. Remind me again what you do. We don't have to talk about it. Ah, come on. Tell me. I want to know. I work for Figueroa Bank. I'm a junior loan officer. - Pretty boring, right? - Not really. No, financing's a big part of the business. If it wasn't for the banks, studios wouldn't be able to make movies. Hey. Hi. Ted. Do we know each other? No. Oh, this is my girlfriend, Cassandra. - Bonnie. - Grass? It's super mellow. Sure. Why not? You here alone? - Yes. - That's cool. You swing? Beg your pardon? Do you swing? Ted and I were going to go upstairs to one of the guest bedrooms. Do you want to join us? Lori's totally cool about it. Super mellow. Candy, there you are. Oh, my God. I was looking all over for you. Please, excuse me. You saved my life. I was just propositioned by a couple from "Dark Shadows." Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie. What? I heard about you and Steve. Oh, you did? You are so brave to come here. To a party? Yes, where everyone can see you. I could never do that. I would be too ashamed, but you were so strong. Oh, Candy. Can I tell you something? Just between us? Anything. You're a bitchy busybody. You've always been a bitchy busybody. I don't need your pity. What I need is a drink. But the thing is, my branch is on Broadway, but a lot of people don't even know about that branch, even though it's the second-largest branch in Los Angeles. Isn't that funny? Yeah. You didn't laugh. Terry? Deidra. Do you remember me? I met you here a few weeks ago. That's right. You're Deidra. And you're Diana. Whoa. That is so weird. - You thought that I was her? - You kinda look alike. Well, I don't want to interrupt. Oh, no, no, no, you're not. Diana was just telling me about her job. Oh, what do you do? I work at a bank. What about you? I'm a stewardess for Pan Am. That's right. Paris to LA, LA to Bombay. Now I remember. Do you want to get a drink, Deidra? I would love to. Great, - this party just got a lot better. - Oh, yeah, really? Excuse me. I love your dress. Thank you. I'm Masha. That's an interesting name. It used to be "Marsha," but I changed it to Masha to make it sound more exotic and memorable. I'm an actress. Or at least, I'm trying to be. Good luck. I used to act, once upon a time. Oh, did you do any TV? I just played a rape victim on "Cannon." This was back in New York, before I was married. Is that all you're going to have? My boyfriend and I are spending the weekend at Zuma Beach, so I want to make sure I look good in my bikini. - Hey, this looks amazing. - Hey. Bonnie. Do you two know each other? We used to be bridge partners. This is your wife? I think I'm going to go powder my nose. Lovely girl. What's her major? Spare me the smart-ass attitude. I'm not going to feel bad about this. Of course you aren't. Feeling bad would require you to have a conscience. No, I tried to reconcile with you, and you weren't interested. I don't want to reconcile. If you want to do something useful, why don't you help us financially? Do you know that the girls and I are barely holding on? I told you that you weren't going to be able to go it alone. Then do something about it. I can't. The little money I have is frozen right now. But you still manage to afford a weekend getaway to Zuma Beach with Masha? No, we're staying at her parents' beach house. So it doesn't cost me anything. Besides your dignity. Does she know that you've been charged with embezzlement? Actually, does she know how to spell "embezzlement?" First of all, it's called fraud, and it's not funny. - I could go to jail. - Aww. Don't worry, darling. On your birthday, I'll bake a file into your cake. Hey. Whether you believe it or not, I still love you. Have fun at the party, Steven. Don't keep Masha up past her bedtime. So we're recording an album at Sound City. I know the place has history, but God, that place is a shit box. Oh, my God. You're Judy Maxwell. That's me. I... I love your music Can I have your autograph? Yeah. Uh... here. "To Diana," please. This is a phone bill. Sorry, I grabbed my mail on the way out. It's all I have. Your album, "Cloud Dreams," was everything to me. I was in love with Mitch Newton, but he was dating my best friend, so I would just lock myself in my bedroom and listen to "Cloud Dreams." ♪ Cloud dreams ♪ ♪ It seems ♪ ♪ Made me love you when I had you ♪ ♪ Made me miss you in the moonbeams ♪ God. I would cry for hours. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, well, I can't mail it in now, but... Oh. There are a lot of drugs at this party. Someone gave me a Quaalude. I love ludes. I wrote the entire "Cloud Dreams" album on ludes. - You did? - Yeah. This one's for you, Mitch. You'll never know what you missed. Oh, uh, money is incredibly dirty and disgusting. Come on. One line won't kill you. Hell with it. Ooh... okay. Yeah, nice. What our hearts already know is that we are all part of the one. The one is many, and the many is one. Dying is an illusion, and life is a dream state that represents only one plane of our existence. Everyone that I knew who ever died pretty much stayed dead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. You came here because you are seeking the jai, little sparrow... a victory. I am. How on Earth did you know that? The universe speaks to those who listen. Oh, honey, I'm listening. Did the universe say what kind of victory? Was it a professional victory, by any chance? And did Lori Meltzner's name happen to come up? You are a viramita. Viramita? You are stalled in the karmic flow. Sorry, but I can't be. Not tonight. Hey, where'd she go? Hey, um, is there some kind of kick in the pants you can give my "virama," or whatever it's called? There is nothing I can do. The victory you seek tonight will elude you, unless you live in the light. Your chakra is black. That sounds bad. It is. Shit. My chakra's black. What does that mean? I'm not sure. I think it means I'm not moving forward with my life. Do you think that's true? I don't know. I've got my own problems. Steve's here. Is that who he's cheating with? God damn him. I thought he'd at least wait a decent amount of time. How the hell does he do that? How does he just forget that any of it ever happened, like it doesn't matter? Do you want to leave? No. I'm not going to let him win this. I just need to use the ladies' room and pull myself together. I'll catch up with you later. Ooh, can you feel that? Can you feel that groove? - Diana... - No, no, no, don't fight it. It's everywhere. Dance all night till the feeling is right. I need to go talk to Lori. Ugh. Forget Lori. Forget Lori. There are people doing things in these bedrooms that I did not know were physically possible. Do you know how many people can fit in a bed? Come look. Come look... they don't mind. It's quite a view, isn't it? Yes, it is. Is that the PCH down there? I think so, yeah. Mm, I wasn't sure. Well, if there are any other streets you're not sure about, just, uh, let me know. I'm Bonnie. Adam. It's nice to meet you. Do you, uh, work in the business? My friend does. What about you? I'm a painter. Really? Might I have seen your work somewhere? I don't know. How much of the house have you seen? Most of these paintings are mine. Really? These? These are beautiful. Not that I know anything about art. Nobody does. But, uh, Lori buys a lot of my stuff. Think she likes the idea of having a starving artist at her parties. Speaks to her bohemian side. I can understand why she'd find that attractive. Oh, shit! I'm so sorry. - Oh. - I got it. - Really, it's, uh... - Here. Hey, it's fine, please. I, uh, I'm going to try and get some water on this. Streisand's not going to do that picture, Jimmy. She's not interested. She's making a mistake, Lori. You gotta talk to her, tell her she's wrong. You forgot to say "and then duck." Where are all the goddamn cigarettes? May I? Uh-oh. Cigarette girl, wandering through the crowd at just the right moment. Parties are getting classier all the time. You don't know me, Ms. Meltzner. Yeah, I know that. I'm Kathleen Callahan. It is very nice to meet you. May I have a bottle of club soda and a towel? And a shot of vodka. Yeah. Okay. Here. Let me help you with that. It's fine. I, uh... - I think... - Uh-huh. The shirt is done. Sorry. I didn't mean to come on so strong. I've just had a really strange night. Do you ever feel like you just woke up in someone else's life? Are you kidding? This is Hollywood. I feel like that every single day. It was my fault. I was a little thrown when you made the first move, 'cause I'm from Nebraska, and that is not the way things work back there. I think I'm out of practice when it comes to meeting men. Hell, I've been married so long, I don't know if I ever knew how. Oh, you're, uh... you're married. Well, I was. We're breaking up. I'm sorry to hear that. Actually, I'm not. Maybe it would be better if we just started all over? Hi. My name is Bonnie. My name's Adam. So, Kathleen, the cigarette queen. Tell me a little about yourself. Me? I work in casting. That's funny. I know everybody, but I don't know you. Why is that? Well, I just opened my own agency. Mm. So what studio were you doing casting for before you opened your own office? I'm doing it with my boyfriend, and he worked for Paramount. What about you? Nowhere. I've never done this before. So you don't know anything about casting? No, but I'm a fast learner, and I pick things up real quick. Well, good luck with that, honey. They're going to eat you alive out here. Is that it? If you're going to make it in this town, you're going to need some balls. Do you know how many times Robert Evans made me cry before I told him to go screw himself? Once. You got a card? Yes, I do. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I don't want to keep you from your friends. Oh, honey, these people aren't my friends. In this business, you can't afford friends, because sooner or later, they're going to cost you. What the hell is that? ♪ Cloud Dreams ♪ ♪ Made me love you when I had you ♪ ♪ Made me miss you in the moonbeams ♪ ♪ Cloud Dreams ♪ ♪ Why did you go away ♪ ♪ Why did you go away ♪ Terry! Terry! You're an asshole. You know that? And Deidra, you're not pretty. No, you are pretty. You're beautiful. But I work at a bank. And I'm not ashamed of that. You know, 'cause without banks, where would all you people put your money? I protect your money from the bank robbers. Who's this crazy bitch and why is she on my goddamn roof? And I'm funny. Everybody at work says so. I made Jan laugh. Jan's deaf! She has two hearing aids. That's not boring! You know what else isn't boring? This! Diana... Every time I have a party, I have to drain the goddamn pool. Ugh... Here. Put this on. It's freezing out here. Kathleen, you're here. And you're taking care of me. Just like a fairy godmother. Is she with you? Yes. She's my friend. Now that takes balls. Oof. I should probably go and find my friends. - Can I get your number? - Oh. I don't know if I should do that. Well, let me give you mine. Just in case you, uh, wake up in somebody else's life again. Bye. Bye.
