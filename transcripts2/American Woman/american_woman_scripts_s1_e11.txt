  - All right,  close your eyes. Once in a man's life,  he creates the perfect pancake. I think--  well, you be the judge. Hey, hey. Good morning, beautiful. All right, girls. Clear your plates. Put them in the sink, please, for your mother. - Mom, dad made chocolate chip pancakes. - Yeah, the girls helped.  - You mean I helped. - I did, too. - You kept putting your fingers  in the batter.

 - I was tasting it.  - Never underestimate the impact of a satisfied taster on the morale of the chef.  - See? - Oh, oh, I was just telling the girls. I think we should all  go to the country club tonight for dinner.  - Tonight? - Yeah. What, do you have other plans? - No, I just--I didn't realize  we were still members. - Oh, yeah, no. We paid the annual dues in March. So we're still good. - Dad, if you're gonna take us to school, we should go.  - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.  I promised I'd run the girls to school on my way to work.

 All right, kids Come on. Chop, chop, chop. So I'll make a reservation tonight for four. Like, 6:00? - Yeah, that's great. Hey, baby. - Mmm,  good morning. - Last night was... pretty unexpected. - Yes, it was.  - Hmm. I want us to be together. - Are you sure  I'm what you want? - I want us to get married in Ojai under that oak tree that you love. I wanna buy a house in the Valley and have tons of kids. I wanna grow old with you. My grandma gave me this when I turned 21. And I've been saving it for when I met the right woman. - If we don't start playing soon, we're gonna lose the courts. - Just a couple more stretches. So does your brand new job  come with a brand new raise? - Only if I had a brand new penis. - Kathleen, what's that on your finger? - Oh, this?  Greg asked me to marry him this morning.  - And you said yes? - Well, that's why I'm  wearing the ring. - And this is Greg, like, homosexual Greg? - Don't call him that.  - Okay, fine. Are you engaged to the Greg that likes to have sex with other men?  - We love each other. Relationships are all about  making sacrifices. - He's giving up men,  and I'm giving up onion bagels and Mexican food. - I don't think that's  the same thing. Bonnie, can you help me out here? - I don't really think I'm in  a position to judge. I slept with Steven last night. - I think that's great.  That's really great. - Your voice just went  five octaves higher. - How did this happen?  - He came over to tell me that he's gonna sell his Jag so that  I can keep the house. And we were drinking  and talking. And it all just started  to feel so familiar. - Like when you were married to him and he cheated on you. - The girls were so happy  this morning. You should have seen them. - Are the two of you getting back together? - Well, come on.  Let's play. I have a wedding  to get in shape for. - So, you should have everything you need. But if you have any questions, you can ask Catherine. - Catherine?  - Your secretary. - Oh, right, yes.  Catherine. - Here we go. - Is something wrong? - I have a window. I didn't know I was going  to have a window. - Senior staff meetings start at 11:00. And here's your key. - Look what I got. - Did you buy every bridal magazine in the city? - Almost.  Let's order in and start talking about color schemes. - Oh, I'm supposed to have lunch with Dave Barnes. - Dave Barnes?  - He's an old friend of mine. He's in development in Columbia. - Oh, well, we'll have plenty  of time to go over all this. - Kathleen. Dave's just a friend. Why don't you join us? - No, I'm sure you two have  plenty to catch up on. - So, this real estate  development we invested in isn't panning out. I think we should  pull the plug. - It looks as though we--  - Figueroa Bank should drop this project, right? We all agree? Great.  - Next up, corporate says complaints  about our customer service have gone up.  Thoughts? - That's 'cause the lines  have gotten longer. Most people just come to do  withdrawals and deposits. We should consider adding those  automated teller machines. - Our customers can't operate a complex computer. - Actually, they're quite  easy to use. - I tried one. It's so simple, even I could use it. Maybe we can give it a shot. - Well, corporate might like  that we're cutting edge. Moving on. I'd like to discuss interest rates for the quarter. - Can we go say hi to Stephanie and Monica over there? - Yes, just be back  before dinner. - Okay, this calls  for a celebratory drink. - Um, I'd like a--  - Two martinis, dry. - Look who's back together.  I can't believe it. - Take it easy, Carol.  We're just having dinner. - I had a bet with Candy that  you two would be back together before the summer.  So it looks like she owes me lunch at Dan Tana's.  - So all the trouble I caused is worth it, then. - You two should  join us for dinner. - We'd love to. - They've just hired  a new chef. He worked at Chasen's,  and his coq au vin is to die for. I mean, with the amount  of butter he uses, you definitely don't want  to think about the calories, but it is Heaven. - Bonnie. - You have to help me chair  the St. Ann's fundraiser again this year. The theme is  "Gone With The Wind." I'm a sucker for hoop skirts  and southern accents. - With a dash of slavery. - Can you talk to your boss  at the May Company and see if he'd throw in  a gift certificate for the silent auction?  - Oh, uh, Bonnie's not working there anymore.  - Oh. You must be so relieved.  - Not really. I liked it.  - Someone's been reading Ms. Magazine. Well, on the bright side,  more time to shop. You and Becca should come with me and Hayley tomorrow.  She needs something for Cotillion,  so I'm taking her to Neiman's. - I don't want to shop for lame  over-priced dresses. - Come on, what girl doesn't like shopping? Are you sure she's  your daughter? - Oh, she's definitely my daughter. - Don't you wanna look  as beautiful and stylish as your mother?  If you did, I bet you'd have a boyfriend.  - I'll go shopping with you, Mom.  - That's my girl. - Can we start thinking about Cotillion dresses for me? Golf tomorrow? - Mm. - Hey. Are you okay?  - I was fine, until somebody woke me up. - We were supposed to meet for drinks. You remember? - I must have lost  track of time. - When did you start taking Valium? - Since I started  getting stressed out. - Kathleen. Kathleen. - Ah, I said good night to the girls. - Mmm. Let's not go too fast, Steven. It'll be too confusing  for Becca and Jessica. - I'll call you tomorrow.  - Okay. - Good night.  - Good night. Hello? - You have to get it out of your system, sweetie. - I don't want to. - We're trying to help you. Either puke, or we're going  to make you puke. - I can't.  You have to do it. - Okay. Get over the toilet. Sorry, Kathleen. - Here we go. - Okay, good. - Okay.  We gotta do it again. - Get your fingers  out of my mouth! - I'm afraid you don't get to  decide what goes in your mouth until you can make  adult decisions. Now get it out.  Come on. - I'm sorry. I don't like watching people vomit, or hearing it, or seeing it, or smelling it. Anything associated with it. Okay, good, good, good. - That's my cue.  - Good girl. It's coming out. - Good.  That's okay. I know.  I know. I feel so stupid. - Sweetie, you don't have  to feel stupid around us. - What were you trying to do?  Kill yourself? - Of course not. It was an accident. I just started worrying about the wedding and... I guess I just took too many pills. - It's okay.  - It's not okay. - What were you worried about? - I don't know.  - Yes, you do. - I've imagined my wedding since I was a little girl. My bridesmaid's dresses are baby blue with empire waists. The bouquet is white roses with gardenias. And I'm marrying a tall, strong, and handsome man. And when he hugs me I get lost in those big arms, and feel like I'm home. And I'm afraid that's exactly the kind of man that Greg wants, too. - You don't have  to go through with it. - I know I have to be strong, Bonnie, but I'm not like you. I'm not strong. - I'm not as strong  as you think I am. - That's not true. We are all stronger  than we think we are. - I'm real sorry I scared y'all like this. Ugh, just promise me you'll never stick your finger down my throat again. - Oh, Kathleen.  You know I can't make that promise. - I come bearing donuts. Are the girls up yet?  - They're still asleep. - I left Marsha. - You what?  - I left her. I want to come home. I want us all to be together. - Oh. That's not exactly the response I was expecting. - I don't want to be together. I don't want  the life that we had. I don't want any of it. - Then what the hell have you been doing the last few days? - I've been trying  to convince myself that I could do this again. - Oh, my God. Well, try harder. - Steven. I--I like my life without you. I hate the club  and all those people, and I hate that you don't ask  me what I want to drink. This is about you and me. We don't work anymore. - You can't do this without me. - I'll find a way  to take care of us. - Okay. Don't come crawling back to me when it all falls apart. - Don't worry. I won't. - As I said,  get rid of the courtyards. You can fit another six units  in the same sized plot. - Or we could invest in mini malls. - Why on Earth would we  want to do that? People aren't gonna  go to mini malls when they can go  to Rodeo Drive. Now, these apartment buildings  will provide cash flow which-- - Excuse me. I wasn't finished. Not everybody has time to go to Rodeo Drive. These developers are buying these abandoned gas stations and they're turning them into retail centers. This is something I think we should get in on. - Do you know anyone who works  in commercial real estate? - Actually, I do. I'd be happy to reach out.  - Good idea, Diana. Let's move on, shall we? I'd like to move on  to loan page four. - What's going on?  - I wanted to tell you and Jessica that your  father and I are not getting back together.  We're getting a divorce. - I thought you were--  - I know. It's been very confusing these  last couple days, hasn't it? - Not really. You and Dad kind of suck together. - Yeah, that's what I realized,  too. - What about Adam?  - Mmm... I think it should probably  just be the three of us for a little while. That's good. You and Adam kind of suck, too. Are we gonna have to move out of our house? - Yeah. I'm sorry. - Can I paint  my new room orange? - You can paint your room  whatever color you want. Ooh! Yes, come here. Come here.  - Mom, okay. - Oh, yes.  Oh, yes. - Mmm. - We can't do this.  We can't get married. - What? Why? - I will always care about you. And I want to keep  working with you. But I need to share my life  with somebody that I can trust. Who I know wants to be with me  in every possible way. - I want that to be me. - Baby, you need to let  yourself want more. You deserve to be swept off  your feet by a handsome man who's a cross between  Paul Newman and Robert Redford. And you know what? So do I. - Yes?  - Ms. Vaughn? Your doctor is on line two. - Thank you. Hello? Yes, this is she. What? How many weeks along am I? I see. Thank you. - Excuse me.  I think this is yours. - Oh, I don't think I dropped one. - Well, then, I guess I'll  have to find another way to talk to you. - I could drop my racket. - You free for dinner tonight?  No sporting equipment needed. - Really?  - How do you feel about Mexican food? - I love Mexican food. - Bonnie. Did Randall finally come to his senses? - He will. - Well, you came back at the right time. Rumor is we're getting some new mannequins with bigger bustlines this afternoon. - I missed the always exciting  world of high-end retail. - Well, I missed you, too. - Mrs. Nolan. What do you think you're doing? - It's called work, Randall.  - I'm aware of the concept. Why are you doing it here?  - I am the best saleswoman you have.  No offense, Louise. - None taken.  - And you made a huge mistake letting me go.  - Oh-- - See the woman over there  looking at that $100 wrap-around dress?  I'll get her to buy a $300 Halsten  in under five minutes. - Denise, how are you?  - Hi. - Shopping for the LACMA  fundraiser this weekend? - Of course.  - Just a warning. Theresa Marshall bought  this exact dress. But this one--  We just got it in today. It would look stunning on you. - Oh, it's a bit more than  I was planning to spend. - I'm not supposed to do this,  but if you buy it today, I'll make sure no one else  does before Saturday. You'll be the only one  wearing it. - You can do that?  - For you, I can. Let's get you set up  in a dressing room. - Hmm.
