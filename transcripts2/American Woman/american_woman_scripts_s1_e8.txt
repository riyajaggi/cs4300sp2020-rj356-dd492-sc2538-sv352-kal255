 Should we be bad and get one of their giant cinnamon rolls? We'll have the cinnamon roll, please. Steve and I are in a better place, I think. We've reached an understanding of sorts. And being with Adam has been very exciting. I feel like I'm 25 again. I'm gonna go back on birth control. You know, for... for the sex. Isn't anybody going to say anything? Can you pass the cream?

 Thanks. Are you okay? Me? Oh, I'm fine. You don't seem fine. Finding out about Greg was a shock, but life goes on. As long as the pills hold up, right? Is that supposed to be funny? No, not at all. I was just telling the truth. Oh, yeah, I forgot. That's your new thing now, isn't it? Just saying exactly what you think. You know, I can't fix your life. You wanna know why this thing happened with you and Greg

 and what it all means, then go find out, Kathleen. I'm just looking for a little understanding. - I'm gonna go. - Kathleen... No, I... Do you wanna tell me what is going on? Nothing's going on. I'm fine. - Hello? - Hi. Hi. Steven, how are you? Uh, I'm good. Good. I'm at the office, so... Back in the game, Bonnie. It feels great. You sound happy. The judge accepted the plea bargain, so I don't have to serve any time. You know, now that I have my feet back on the ground, if there's anything you need, just let me know. If you could start paying the mortgage again on the house, that would be a big help. I want to, but I'm... financially, I'm a little strapped right now. I mean, the fine the judge laid on me was really heavy. But I'm not gonna complain. Yes, you will. You love to complain. Yeah... yeah, I know. Listen, I know it's kind of short notice, but I was hoping I could take the girls out to dinner tonight, you know. Nothing fancy, just a little celebration. Sure. I think they'd like that. And, um, you know, you could come too if you want. I'll pass. Okay. Okay, I'll swing by after work. - Okay, see you then. - Okay. Back in Texas, we have a saying: don't dig up more snakes than you can kill. But lucky for us, we're not in Texas. I want a whole new look in here. Well, there's plenty of potential here. - Lots of options. - Good. I wanna rethink this place from top to bottom. I want it all out, everything. So let's talk about budget. There is no budget. You spend whatever you have to. There's a lot in here that brings up memories I'd rather forget. So by the time you're done, I don't wanna see a single thing in here that reminds me of my old life. I'm gonna give you a whole new place. Good. Sorry that took so long, Mrs. Nolan. That's all right. So... - How's the family? - Good, thank you. Great. Will you tell Steve I would love to get a round of golf in at the club when he's got the time? Steve and I split up. - I didn't know that. - Yes. Getting back on birth control would not be wise, considering your situation. My situation is my business, and the state of California agrees with me. No, no, I'm not talking about that, Mrs. Nolan. It's about your examination. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Yes? There is a Kathleen Callahan here to see you. Send her in. - How are you? - I'm not here for small talk. I know about you and Greg. You knew him in New York. Was he like this then? Like what? Do you think this is a joke? Were the two of you together in New York? Yes. Do you love him? Yes. Greg warned me. He told me you were a bad person. I'm not a bad person, Kathleen. I'm in love with him. There is an order to things in this world, Alan, and you're not allowed to rewrite the rules to fit your needs. Hey. Hey. Where's your sister? Your father's gonna be here any minute. She's still getting dressed. What's the matter? I don't really wanna go. I mean, he was kind of a jerk the other night. I know, baby. This hasn't been easy for any of us, including your father. Are you glad he's not going to jail? Of course. I wouldn't have gotten any satisfaction from having your father in prison... Unless they made me the warden. Mm. - Oh, is that me? - Yes. Yeah, your dad and I took you to San Diego when you were about three. You wouldn't stop crying, so we took you down to the water, and you just stood there and stared at the ocean. You couldn't believe there was so much water in one place. And then the waves came up, and they hit your feet, and you started laughing so hard. That was a great day. - What are you doing? - Looking at pictures. Oh. Look, Jessica, that's you, right after you came home from the hospital. That must be your dad. I'm gonna go show dad my dress. Okay. Mom? Mom. Yes? Sorry. Let's go say hi to your dad. What's going on? Um... Bishop just promoted Jeff. He waited till I was at lunch. Where are they? Bishop is showing him his new office. Here. We took up a little collection. All the girls chipped in. It's not much, but we figured you could buy yourself something or... You're kind of an inspiration to the rest of us, Diana. Well, thank you, ladies, but it really wasn't necessary. I'm not anybody's inspiration. Ladies, I'd like to propose a toast. To Jeff, the only man for the job. Huh? Diana, is that you? - Yes. - You're home early. That's unusual. What's the matter? I didn't get the promotion. Oh, Diana, I'm so sorry. I know how much that meant to you. Did Mr. Bishop give you a reason why? No, of course not. He doesn't have to. Anyways, I don't wanna talk about it anymore. This tuna fish sandwich is giving me terrible heartburn. I think the tuna might've gone bad. Do you want the other half? You... you just said that it went bad. Oh, you've got a strong stomach. You're just like your father. He could eat an old shoe and be ready for anything. Thanks, Mom. Excuse me. Yes? You're very well dressed. Oh... thank you. Are you a homosexual? I just need to talk to you - for a minute. Please. - Excuse me. My boyfriend's a homosexual too. Would you keep your voice down? People know me in here. Do you think I'm an attractive woman? I've got a nice figure. Please don't walk away. Just tell me what to do. There's nothing you can do. Daddy... Hi. How are you? I hope I'm not calling too late. Nothing's wrong. No, I just... I'm just feeling homesick. I know. I will. Greg? Um... Greg's doing good, Daddy. Yeah, he's... he's real good. Are you into astrology? No. If the stars are in charge of my fate, they're doing a shit job. Let me guess, you're a Virgo. No, I told you I don't believe in that. It's bullshit. What do you believe in? Not much of anything right now. Sounds like you need another drink. - You live around here? - Just around the block. Well, guess what. Stars just lined up for you. For what it's worth, I'm a Gemini. Oh. God damn it! Oh! - Damn it! - Oh, my God. Jesus, lady, look at that! Hey, Mom, we're home! How was it? Mom, I had French fries with mayonnaise. That's how they eat them in France. Mmm. Did you have a good time? Yeah, it was good. - Sorry we're a little late. - It's okay. Girls, say good night to your father and go brush your teeth. - Yeah, there we go. - Mm. See you soon. Thanks for a lovely evening. - She's a handful. - Yes, she is, and she's setting her sights on you now, so strap yourself in. It's gonna get rough. Do you mind if I join you? Help yourself. What's wrong? Oh, come on, I know. This is about that conversation we had about the mortgage. Listen, I wanna help out. I just need a little bit of time to get back on my feet. I can't have any more children. It's called secondary infertility. The doctor said it's rare for a woman my age, but it... it happens. I'm so sorry. Me too. If I wasn't gonna have another baby, I just want it to be my own decision. It's just another part of my life that's over now. The doctor also said, since I can't get pregnant, I can have as much sex as I want. That's great. Wow, that's great. That's great. Good. I always wanted a little boy. Yeah, I remember. Did you have a name picked out? Yes. - Jack. - Jack. That's a good name. Here's to Jack. To Jack. Take off your shirt. Take off your pants. If you want this, you're gonna have to do - everything I say, understood? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Don't look down. Look at me. Sorry. I didn't say you could talk. Not until I say. Thomas, what the hell is going on? Amy? What are you doing here? Yes, Thomas, what is Amy doing here? Daddy? Oh, honey. Get the hell out of my house. - What is wrong with you? - Sorry. What kind of person are you? Oh... Mom? Mom... is she gonna be okay? Mom! Oh, I'm sorry. Diana. How's she doing? I'm still waiting to hear. Miss Vaughan? Yes? Your mother suffered a heart attack. Uh, is she all right or... Her blood pressure's a bit higher than I'd like, but she's stable. Can I see her? She's resting right now, but I'll have someone come and get you. That's good news, right? I should've been there. But you're here now. - Thanks for coming. - Of course. Where's Kathleen? I don't know. I tried to call her, but she didn't answer. She probably wouldn't have come anyway. I don't blame her. I've been terrible to her lately. You two are gonna patch things up. - You think so? - Of course. We have hard times, but we always come out the other side, don't we? - Yeah. - Come here. Diana. - Hi. - Diana. I'm so scared. Doctor says you're gonna be fine, so... The doctor is 12 years old. What does he know? I'm sorry I wasn't there for you. I told Mr. Bishop that I can't work these hours anymore, so... You weren't at the bank tonight. What? Yes, I was. I'm old, Diana, but I'm not stupid. I know what you've been doing. Yeah. We women have a way of putting the things we want most further and further out of our reach. You have opportunity, Diana. You go and do what I wasn't able to. I will. I'm gonna make you proud of me. I'm already proud of you, honey. - Diana? - Yes, Mom? Could you move over a bit? You're squashing my leg, dear. We need to talk. Well... look who decided to come in today. I know I've made some mistakes lately, but for five years, this bank has been my life, and I've worked really hard to get where I am. And I plan on spending every day from this moment forward busting my ass for you. - What's this? - That's for when you promote me, because I'm gonna make it impossible for you to overlook me again. And this is my fan.
