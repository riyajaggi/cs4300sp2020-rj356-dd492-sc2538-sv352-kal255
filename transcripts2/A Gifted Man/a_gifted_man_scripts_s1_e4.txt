 Hello. Could I get a shot of espresso and a cup of coffee? Would you like to try our chocolate banana empanada? Specialty of the house. Should I have dessert for breakfast? Live a little. Let me think about it. Come on, have one for me. I miss my earthly delights. Sure, I'll try one. She's too young for you. Oh, no.

 Keep it. Did you know this was my favorite place? I used to sit here every day. Hmm. Kate. Are you on a date? Dr. Holt. She calls you doctor? You must love that. I got you a cup of coffee. Thank you. Not sure how you take it. Black. Then it's perfect. Is, uh, is that for me? Yes.

 I hear they're very good. Thanks. None for you? No, thanks. Mm, wow, that is delicious. Let me guess, you're a, uh, more like a brown rice, birdseed kind of guy? Ha! More like red wine, red meat. I want to thank you for reconsidering the Clinica job. I was surprised you had the guts to ask, after that horrible pitch you gave me last week. So what made you change your mind? Your ex-wife accomplished a lot on a shoestring at Clinica Sanando. She really served the community. Anna will be missed. And she married you, so you can't be all bad. So that's a yes? Yes. I would be honored to follow in Anna Paul's footsteps. Oh, that's great. Really. I'm-I'm ready to get to work. I'll walk you over, I got a little more time before my first patient. Great. Let me just, uh, let me get a top up, 'cause I have a mild caffeine addiction. I like her. She seems smart and tough. If I have to be replaced, and I do... Are you ready? Yeah, let's do it. So, a family clinic... that's what you've been holding out for? I quit the HMO to bring good health care to people who can't afford it. And here's where you'll do it. Clinica Sanando. Bet you don't even know what that means. Sandy clinic. No? Healing clinic. Necesita aprender Espanol si quiere trabajar in el 'hood. Wow. You know, I've driven past here for years. Kept meaning to walk in. I work ten blocks away and I never even knew it was here. Guess we see what we need to see. - Oh, my God! - Mommy! Oh, my God, a car crashed into the clinic! Are you okay? Is anybody hurt? Sync and correction by Mlmlte www.addic7ed.com A car crashed through the front of Clinica Sanando. - We need an ambulance. - Everybody okay? Anybody get hit? Cuts and bruises, nothing critical. Car... check inside. Ma'am, you okay? Yes. - Can you move your arms and legs? - I'm okay. What about my kids? You all right back here? Anybody hurt? We're okay. Right, Tasha? I think so. They're okay. Easy, easy. It's a good thing you were wearing your seat belt, huh? Let's get everyone into an exam room. I feel terrible. After everything Dr. Anna did for me. Take a deep breath for me. So you were coming here? I work the night shift. Davion had a stomachache. He looked damn near green. Tasha didn't sleep all night. Thought I should bring them in. My mom brought me here 'cause I'm sick. Where is she? Well, Dr. Michael is looking at your mom to make sure she's okay, and then you get to see her. Is that good? - Does your neck hurt? - A little. Okay, tell me where. It feels funny in the back. You might have pulled a muscle. It's called whiplash. Just move your neck slowly. Follow my finger. Move your neck nice and slow. And here. That's good. What about you, sir? Any neck pain? Numbness, tingling? No. But my stomach hurts. Okay, does it hurt in a kind of poking, stabbing sort of way or more like a I-may-need-to- throw-up kind of way? More like I-might-need- to-throw-up kind of way. I think I got the flu. My heart is still beating so fast. I swear it wasn't my fault. That guy on the bike... he just flew out of nowhere. Well, you have a very reliable witness. Me. Michael, can you come out here for a second? Uh, sure. Be right back. What's up? Look at what Officer Smythe found on the floor of the back seat. Your driver was drinking. Lucille did struggle with drinking. She even lost her kids for a while. Anna helped her get back on track, but maybe she fell off the wagon. That's odd. I didn't smell any alcohol on her breath. I still got to give her the test. Lucille, this is Officer Smythe. - He needs to give you a Breathalyzer. - Why? I haven't had a drink in over a year. Then why was this in your car? I have no idea... You all right? Here, take it easy. Sit up here. Hand me an ophthalmoscope. Have you felt dizzy since you've been here? No. You got to believe me. I'm on probation. I can't lose my kids again; I just can't. Any papilledema? No, but she has extensive hypertensive retinopathy. In English. Damage to the retinas due to high blood pressure. We're lucky we caught it. She could've stroked out. BP's 230/140. You been taking any blood pressure medication? I was, until the prescription ran out. You should have refilled it. I needed the money for the kids' school supplies. Put her on a labetolol drip, until you can rule out a hypertensive emergency. - Doc, I still have to administer the test... - Go ahead. But she's not drunk. Dr. Sykora, can I talk to you? So the cop found a beer bottle in the car. Mom was drinking? No, her only problem was she stopped taking her ace inhibitors. I think someone's flu just became a hangover. Hey, man, so the cops found an empty beer bottle in your mom's car. My mama doesn't drink anymore. That's what we think, too. Mr. Davion? Me and my boys might have gone for a ride last night, - and had a few. - Oh, Davion, you're gonna get it... Shut up, Tasha. Hey, eyes here, pal. Underage drinking, joyriding... you're going to have to face the music. I'll go get a mop and a bucket. Get a EKG on Lucille, and keep her on the drip till her pressure's back to normal. You're leaving? Got to go to work. Anna. Go away. - You know I don't like to cry in front of you. - You don't need to see this. And there are so many people around. Check it out... I'm pretending to talk on my phone. Hey. Kate really took charge in there. Almost reminds me of someone. That's just it... I'm not someone. I can see what's happening, and I can feel what's happening, but there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. It's like if you were in the O.R. and you're about to take out a tumor, and then you find yourself behind three feet of glass. That sounds like hell. It's not heaven. Let's see if I can do something. Hello. Dana. Let me guess... you're canceling dinner. Why would you assume that? Because I'm your sister, I sort of know you. Listen, I'm calling about your friend Anton, the shaman... isn't he a carpenter, too? Yeah, he does beautiful work. Why? Well, I got a job for him. It's more like fast and cheap, but it's for a good cause. Tell him to come over to Clinica Sanando - and find Dr. Kate Sykora. - Thanks, Michael. That's very cool of you. And I will see you tonight. Okay, fine. There you go, I hired someone. So now you don't have to hang around here... anymore. What happened to you? Flat tire? You'll be happy to know I'm done with the clinic. They have a new director. Good. Now you need to tidy up for your 10:00 a.m. Samir Patel, 18. Suffering from frequent headaches... and his poor parents are suffering from that damn video game. So tell me about your headaches, Samir. They started several months ago. Samir is a senior in high school. His college applications will be due soon. He'll apply for early admission to Yale... premed. My wife says that Samir is going to be a great doctor, like you. Thank you. Go, go, go... Yes! This game is his obsession. Apparently, it distracts him from the pain, but I wonder, could this be the cause of his headaches? Prolonged exposure to video games can do that. Samir, you having a headache now? Samir? Samir... Samir, do not ignore us. You must answer the doctor's question. Now! You will not be disrespectful. - Hey, I need that. I need it! - Once you learn to act like an adult. You know, I'd love to speak to your son alone. Samir, let me show you my video game. Can you please tell them that I'm 18 and not eight? That's what parents are for, my friend. To treat you like a kid even when you're an adult. Board activated. So how's your headache? Right now, it's gone. So was it your parents that wanted you to become a doctor? No, that was all me. Really? Check this out. Whoa. Yeah. It's a picture of a neuron with its dendrite and axon... They're brain cells. That's right. Two-photon calcium imaging superimposed on a Brainbow. That's so cool. Right? Did you know that the medulla oblongata has two sensory and motor axons that crisscross? That's why, when someone has a stroke on the left side of the brain, they become paralyzed on the right. Yeah. You do want to be a doctor. Try it. Really? Yeah. Give it a go. Sweet. This thing rocks. As much as your video game? Well, I don't know. You know, Planetary Playground's pretty awesome. You'd totally dig it. I saw the Hubble photos in your office. Didn't think you noticed those. My avatar, he's this genius... uber-nerdy, but he totally kicks ass. I named him the Boy. Why do you need to play so much? I guess it just helps my mind to shut up. I mean, whenever I stop playing, my headaches get worse. Does the pain ever make you nauseous or dizzy? Yeah, I had a dizzy spell a few weeks ago. Uh, school nurse sent me home. She's hot, by the way. Show me where the pain starts. It's kind of like right here. Describe what it's like. I don't really like essay questions. I'm more of a multiple choice man. Me, too. A: Piercing, B: Throbbing, C: Stabbing. None of the above. It's more like loud. Like music or, uh, Planetary Playground? I can't tell you. Samir, you're 18. You're legally an adult. Whatever you tell me is confidential. My headache... it has a voice. It talks to me. Shut up! Shut up! Lie still, please. But my headache is really loud right now. All right, stop. What's it saying? That I should get out of here. Okay, just try to relax. What if we take these pictures and my brain looks normal? Just do the test. I can't! It's too quiet in here. You don't know what it's like to have a voice in your head. You can't understand. I need you to talk to me! I am talking to you. No, in here. Okay, so what do you want to talk about? I don't know. Why'd you become a doctor? Uh, when I was a kid, my dad gave me a, uh, Visible Man model. I thought it was really cool. I had one of those. I like looking at the inside of the body. I like looking at the brain. Yeah, I wanted to know how it worked... chemistry, the wiring, rewiring... so I chose neurosurgery. Uh... then I took a detour. What kind of detour? No talking, okay? I guess it wasn't a detour. It was a woman. She wanted to be a family doctor, so... I switched specialties. Followed her all the way to the frozen tundra of Alaska. We had some adventures there. Sutured a polar bear bite. Did an emergency delivery of an Inuit baby in an igloo. Then it was over. And I came to New York, and I built this. Dr. Holt? The patient's asleep. Figures. Was a boring story. Not for me. Samir's MRI shows a mass on the nerve connecting the brain to the inner ear. Now, this nerve controls balance and hearing, which explains the headaches and the dizziness. What is this mass? Uh, most likely a tumor called a vestibular schwannoma. A tumor... so this is cancer? A schwannoma is usually benign, but I can't say for sure until I operate and biopsy the tissue. And what if you don't? If left untreated, it can lead to deafness. Are there risks if he has the surgery? There are always risks. Surgery itself could leave Samir deaf in the affected ear. My success rate is 100%. It's your decision. If there's something in my head that shouldn't be there, I want you to get it out. Then we'll operate tonight. I hear you need a carpenter. How'd you hear that? Michael Holt... he called a friend of mine. Yes. Hi. Hi. Kate Sykora. Anton Little Creek. Little Creek, huh? You know, Sykora actually means "little bird" in Czech. Oh. So you know Michael. Does that mean that you knew Anna Paul? We, um... we've crossed paths. Well, you came through the waiting room, so you know what a big job it is. This place has amazing energy. I feel so blessed to be here. That's great. Just, uh, dive right in. I'm buried under bills. I'm, uh, still trying to find the insurance policy. Is this it? Thank you. Tavo said I'd find you hiding here. Didn't get the memo, Dr. Barnes? Those things are bad for you. They'll kill you. How are your patients? Lucille's on a drip. BP's going down. Tasha says she feels weird, though. Weird how? She's sleepy, but she can't sleep, and every time she yawns, her neck hurts. Well, she doesn't have whiplash. Probably still freaked out, the poor thing. What's up with you? I've been going through Anna's paperwork. The insurance policy she took out on the clinic... it has a $75,000 deductible. That's too high. But the monthly payments were low. You don't seem surprised. Anna had amazing skills. We were all in awe of her. She was generous to a fault. The day-to-day running of the business? She let things slide a little. Things got tight, she'd go off salary, eat Cheerios for a while. You know, uh... Yeah. Well, the board's going panic about this Think they'll shut us down? Maybe. They have to cover their asses. Maybe you should hit up Anna's ex. Holt's been coming around, and he looks flush. No. I've been in tight binds before. I know how to hustle for funds. You sound like Anna. We're going to get through this, even if I have to eat Cheerios. Do you see the tumor? Right where I knew it would be. Scalpel. Pickups. And good-bye, schwannoma. Wow. You don't see this every day. Michael, what the hell is that? Something extremely rare. Does that thing have teeth? Yes, it can have teeth, even hair. It's called a chimera. It's the beginnings of a human being. The tumor was Samir's twin. Sometimes, in utero, one embryo dies and is absorbed into the other one. It's called a chimera or a vanishing twin. It's grown larger recently, which has been known to happen. The increased pressure on the nerve is what was causing Samir's headaches. This news is difficult for my wife. After Samir was born, we tried for many years just to have another child, but could not. Perhaps we put too much pressure on Samir. Dr. Holt, I want to tell you something. When I became pregnant, I could feel two babies inside my belly. Identical twins. I even named them. Samir... and Amit. In Hindi, Amit means "infinite." How could you not tell me this? Do you remember "the Boy?" Samir mentioned him to me. He said it was the name of his avatar. It was also something else. When Samir was a child, he had... what do you call it? An imaginary friend. We often heard Samir talking to him. He called him "the Boy." My husband thought it was sweet, but I discouraged Samir from having these conversations. I told him to make real friends. So, now, I must wonder, Dr. Holt, could this boy have been the spirit of my other son Amit? With Samir speaking to his brother? Sorry to interrupt. Samir's awe. I think something's wrong. Excuse me. Go away. G Samir? Samir, are you in pain? Samir? No, it's too loud! Shh... What does he mean? Get out. Get out! Get out! Did you leave part of the tumor inside? No, the surgery was a success. Make him stop! Samir! Listen, you need to lie still. I trusted you! You said you would help me! I did, okay? The tumor is gone. No, it's the voice. He's still here. He's screaming at me! You didn't get him out. Samir has been having auditory hallucinations. You knew this and did not let us know. He's an adult. What he tells me is confidential. What can you do for this? We have an excellent neuro-psychiatrist on staff... Dr. Baxter. We'll assess your son's mental status and prescribe medication if needed. Dr. Holt, in India, we knew a woman who practiced Ayurveda. Rita, no. It's all right. Samir will meet with your psychiatrist. Come. Tough case. The margin was clear. The mass is gone. The tumor's incidental. I'm sure you're right. Why? Why are you sure? Uh... because you always find the answer. The answer's in that family. Got a dad who pushes him and a mother who suffocates him. No wonder the kid needs that voice to drown them out. Speaking of fun family dynamics, did you forget about dinner with your sister? If he wakes up and he's agitated, just give him one milligram of lorazepam. No, it's not gonna stop the voice in his head, but it'll put him to sleep. Yep. Who has a voice in their head? I can't discuss my patients with you. Maybe your patient has an Anna. No, he's got a lot of problems. I've done all I can. The mother wants to do an Ayurveda, whatever that is. It's traditional East Indian medicine. Wow... you really freak out when things defy logic, don't you? There's a medical explanation for it. Mm. It's like a phantom limb. A guy loses an arm, but the arm still hurts. Anyway, psychiatric case now. You know, sometimes people think mental illness is misdiagnosed. Anton works with people who thought they were sick, and then the energy healing... Don't start. You sound just like Dad. This case has nothing to do with you. You remember last year, I was having a really hard time, and Milo was getting into all those fights at school? You kept saying, "You're the parent, he's the kid..." It's true. Like that helped. And then I lost my job, and I really started to unravel, remember? I didn't tell you this because I didn't want you to judge me, but I went on a retreat. Another one? It was different. I met Anton. And he really helped clear all the heavy stuff. That's why I thought he could help your patients. Look, I get it that it worked for you, but I do real medicine. Hey, Lucille, you headed home? Dr. Zeke says I am. BP's normal, drip worked. That's good news. you come in here every day this week so I can check your BP and make sure you're taking your meds. I will. I won't be any more trouble, believe me. There's a problem with Tasha. What happened? She was drawing a picture and she started to cry. My neck still hurts, more than before. Baby, it's gonna be all right. Show me where it hurts. Here. And my arm feels tingly. Zeke, let's get her into an exam room. Come on. Sorry about before. You're not like Dad. He never would have tried alternative healing. But then again, he never had a visitation from the other side. Uh, maybe when he was really blasted. Yeah. Daddy did have his demons. This is Dr. Holt. Michael, it's Kate Sykora. We have a neural emergency with a patient from the car wreck. Did Lucille stroke out? I told Zeke to keep her on the drip. Lucille is fine. It's her daughter Tasha. How does she present? Stiffness in the neck, yawning makes her cry, her left arm is numb, and now she's unconscious. All right, get her to Holt right now. She's starting to posture. Penlight. Pupil is blown. Michael, I think her brain is herniating. Okay, listen to me. You're gonna have to relieve her intracranial pressure right now. How? We can't open up her skull here... we don't have that kind of equipment. Zeke, get some I.V. tubing and a spinal needle. Kate, you're going to do a ventriculostomy. Temporal bone is thin enough to punch through without a drill. Listen, insert the needle two centimeters superior and anterior to the pinna. What am I aiming for? Temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. Be careful... if you're off, you'll tear through the sylvian fissure. Okay, I feel the spot. Great. Now insert the needle. Any fluid coming out? Did I miss the mark? Kate, talk to me. She stopped posturing. It worked! Great. Get her an ambulance, I'll meet you at Holt. I decompressed her posterior fossa by removing areas of the skull and spinal column. What are you finding? Your patient has a Chiari Malformation. I'm opening the dura. I've never seen a Chiari before. Lower brain gets displaced downward causing obstruction and compression. She's had it since birth. So it was a congenital condition. Accident probably aggravated it. And that's why she had pain from yawning and a stiffness in her neck. She's lucky she was at the clinic. You and Zeke saved her life. Pretty cool, right? Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't resist. It's really impressive. Movie night at Holt Neuro? No, they're actually called "brainbows." They help us understand neural connections. Hmm. They make the brain really beautiful. What you did for Tasha was amazing. Yeah. Just glad she's okay. Can Lucille see her? I'm sure she's worried sick. Already had the nurse go get her. She can sleep over if she wants, either in Tasha's room or we can get her her own suite. Her own suite. Not exactly the accommodations we have at the clinic. We try. Yes, it must be very hard. So, did you always want to be in family medicine? Actually, I thought about becoming a cardiologist. A woman who wants to understand the heart. Yes, it is almost as clichÃ© as a man who is all about the brain. So, you, uh, you figure 'em out yet? You know, every time I think I do, I realize I'm just a beginner. Yeah. Heart's kinda the same way. Good morning, good morning. Hi, Dr. Mike. Hey, Tasha. Get some sleep? Mm-hmm. Good. Well, she's gonna be fine. Thank you. Thank you so much. Just glad we caught it in time. This is a miracle. Oh, right, you're a doctor; a scientist; you probably don't go for miracles. Not really. When I got clean, my sponsor told me to get friendly with my higher power. I was so low, I lost my faith. But now I believe. There's gotta be a plan, right? Why else would I barely miss that bike messenger and crash my old junk heap into Dr. Anna's clinic? I don't know. So that my sweet baby could get her surgery... from the best. Dr. Baxter evaluated Samir and prescribed medication. Good. He'll come back for a follow-up appointment in two weeks. I'm sorry to bother you, but I think you're the family I'm looking for. Are you the boy with the voice in his head? Christina... Who are you? I'm Dr. Holt's sister. And I want to talk to you about your son. You told her about Samir? No, no, he didn't. I overheard him. And I want to tell you about a healer that I know, a shaman... Excuse us. You have no right interfering here, Christina. Michael, you can help this kid. Anton can release the voice in his head. Leave. Now. Wait! Please! Dr. Holt, I would like to hear what your sister has to say. So would I. All right. Dad, are you coming? Did I just hear your sister's voice at reception? Carries, doesn't it? You're not dressed for your next consult. Yeah, I know. Cancel it. I gotta clear my head. Michael, I know you're relieved to be done with that clinic, but I got a call earlier from Zeke Barnes. He said he thought you'd want to know that they're having an emergency board meeting over there tonight. He said, uh, "Kate doesn't want to bother you, but there's a problem with the insurance." You know what? Zeke should listen to his boss. Momentito. Can I help you? Got a big bump on your head, huh? We're looking for Anton Little Creek. Our carpenter? I do other work, too. You sure you're cool with this, brother? Hey, I'm open-minded. I'm a Pisces. So what exactly are you gonna do? It's an Incan healing technique. It's called an extraction. Samir is gonna release the energy of his twin into this. I'll locate the energy and loosen its hold. Sage will clear the space. The crystal is like a first-class ticket for intrusive energies. They get a nice ride home. The energy of your twin has found a safe place in you. It wants to let go, but he's scared. I want you to think of Amit just going down your arm and right into the crystal. Is the spirit out? What are you so mad about? You always used to go running when you were pissed off. Or when I wanted to be alone. You think I'm an idiot? I hired people to deal with your clinic, and it's a sinking ship. The Clinica was my life's work. I didn't have children and a husband, I had my patients and my staff; they were my family. Well, then you should've taken better care of them. I did the best I could under difficult circumstances. You never got your act together. Just like Alaska, you make rash decisions, you don't prioritize. Oh, don't bring up the jade earrings. You bought gifts for our patients when we couldn't even pay the gas bill. Grandma Leah deserved something nice. She wasn't your grandma! Don't lecture me, it's too late. Why can't you face your mistakes? All right. I screwed up. I bounced checks, I maxed out credit cards. You know better than anyone else. And now your family is in trouble. Yes. And what a shock... who do you come to to bail you out? Dr. Holt! Samir. Well, you look, uh, you look better. You guys leaving? Uh, yeah. Dad's waiting for us. You know, it worked. The voice is gone. Anton's gonna build a bonfire tonight to help release Amit's spirit to the other side. Wish I could be there. We'll talk about it. Okay. I'm like you, Dr. Holt, I don't usually go for all this mystical business. But thank you for everything you did for my family. Of course. Thanks. There are no words. Wait a minute. For you, Dr. Holt. So, Christina brought my patient to you. Samir did some heavy lifting in there. But he's clear. He told me. So, maybe now you understand what I do. No. But if you believe it, Samir believes it... It's called the placebo effect. Sometimes, a sugar pill works as well as meds. No one knows why. You are one stubborn cat, Dr. Holt. I think this was meant for you. It's the Hindu god Ganesh. He removes obstacles. Right gift for a shaman. Surgeon could use it more. Come in. You need a new nameplate. Ah, you certainly got dressed up to tell me that. You must be dressed up for the board meeting. How do you know? Heard there was a problem with the insurance. Ah. Zeke ratted me out. He was just trying to help. So, why didn't you come to me? Michael, I don't want your money. And besides, it would only be a Band-Aid. So what are you going to do? Uh, well, I have connections at foundations. I can apply for emergency funds. I mean, while I'm out doing the legwork, the board will probably close us down for a while. Unless... You saved a girl's life yesterday. You helped. That's my point. We did it together. Michael, I really need a team here. We are so understaffed. I have a job. I know. And when I saw you performing surgery last night, I really wanted to let you off the hook. But if I could tell the board that we had a new doctor on staff... not a new doctor, you... you could make all the difference. I'll give you five hours a week. Fifteen. Don't you want the clinic to survive? All right, ten. Really? You'll work with me? Yes. Sync and correction by Mlmlte www.addic7ed.com
