 I ain't seen you in, like, three days. You OK'? Yeah. Look, you know we knew this was gonna happen sooner or later, innit'? Yeah, I woulda preferred it to be later though, bruv, and I woulda preferred it to be someone that fucking deserved it. Those aren't good thoughts to be having right now, Shane. Trust me, the best thing we can both do is just block it out. You tell anyone? You think I'm mad? Look, as long as only me and you know what went down... then we're cool. Well, keep it that way, innit'? You alright, Mrs Hill'? Wanna lift? No, thanks, we'll walk.

 You sure? Later on. There's something about that boy. What's wrong with him? It was alright. It was alright. Good, good. I told you you'd like it. Some nice girls in there. Yeah. What a waste of life. Mrs Campbell is my church sister, you know. She'll never see her son again. I'll buy some flowers and bring them down tomorrow. Listen, I'll be up in a minute, yeah, Mum? Go on. I'm coming. That must be your mum. Looks like a nice lady. I thought you'd have been in touch with me by now. I'm dealing with it, innit'? I'm gonna get your money. I ain't in the habit of chasing my own debts. That's Lee's job. Now look at the fucking state of him. Yeah, well, he deserved that. What happened to your brother, that was down to me. Now, when I get my money, you're gonna have to come up with a way to make this right by Lee 'cause he ain't gonna fucking swallow this and neither am I! Leon. Right, who wants some gym time? Mandy? Alright. Rachel? I'll go. Good. There's room for more. OK. Come on. This is it. I just need 20 grand for the deposit. Do you like it? What do you think? Where are the shops? Where are the shops? It's nice to be away from the shops and people and all that. It's boring. Shut up. Needs decorating, of course. I'll decorate it for you. You're on. I don't think I've got enough for that deposit. You could ask more for the crop. I'm selling wholesale to the Vietnamese. You know what that means. Lower price? Quite a good bit lower. You should sell to somebody else. I know the olders on the estate. No, no, no. You haven't told anyone, have ya'? No. I swear. That's the way you get caught, that is. It's safer to sell to the Vietnamese. But then you don't get the flat. Well, if it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be, is it? Just getting bare missed calls, you know. Snack's poppin', bruv. No food. At this rate, it's a job centre thing, bruv. Settle down. You think I'm joking? I ain't goin' to no fucking job centre, bruv. Yo. Wha gwan'? Yo, Shane, did you hear about Shaun'? That was some messed up shit, bruv. Yeah. What happened to Shaun was dark. Shaun wasn't even a road man, like, he was innocent. It's bad luck on him, bruv. Either way, it gives us an opportunity, ya get me? Shaun is Kamale's cousin, innit'? He might be careful, but he ain't gonna disrespect his family, you get me? Kamale's gotta show. I reckon either at the shrine or at the aunties yard. Alright? And when he shows that's when we make our move, innit'? Alright, you two, you go down the shrine. What? Go to the shrine. Keep a lookout. Anyone comes, you make sure you call one of us. - Fucking hurry up. - Find a good spot, bruv. Yeah. Where no-one can see you lot. What you sayin"? Wha gwan. Wha gwan. Hey! Where you lot goin'? School. Nah, you've got the day off. I want you to do me a favour. Go down to London Fields for me. What? That's E8. That ain't my gates. Bruv, shut up, man. Don't worry about that. Just go down there, keep your eye out. You see Kamale, Ninja, bell me. Straightaway, yeah? Here, take that. - Make sure you bell me, you know. - Yeah. - Don't leave till you see him. - Safe. Yo, you know I got a ting that lives opposite Shaun's mumsie's yard. Yeah? Yeah? Right, you go and check there, then, innit'? Alright. Cool. He's going to fuck that. I know he is. Come, Sully, come. Bruv, I'm telling you now, if man don't deal with Kamale, Raikes is coming after man, as simple as that. Hear that, still. But, yo, there's that other ting. The snake. Bruv, we ain't got time for that now! Blud, we can't put this off no more, you know. If it weren't for that snake, fucking house wouldn't have got licked down in the first place. Man wouldn't even be in this mess right now! You know someone's talking, man. It's that Gem kid. Listen, you're going on like you want it to be him or something, bruv. I'm sayin' I don't think it's him. Just fucking leave him, man! What?! What are you sayin"? What? Blud, why you giving me orders? I ain't giving no orders. You just said leave him, no? Like, that sounded like an order, fam. Like, why you giving me orders? Bruv, I ain't givin' you no orders. I just said we ain't got no time for this shit, bruv. You know what? You go down the school here, tell that kid I wanna talk to him, yeah? Hold it. Fam, what's up wid you? I ain't tryin' to make a big issue out of this or nothin', I'm just sayin', like, I don't think it's him. Well, we're just gonna have to disagree on this one. Whatever, man. Just need to collect as many pictures as possible for your subject, and just bring them in. Yo! What ya sayin"? What you up to? Nothin'. It's school, innit'? Come, man, come chill with us. Bring your dog, come do some tricks. I can't, my dad will go mad if he finds I'm not at school. Bruv, fuck your dad, man, fuck school. Come, we go. Come, man. I gotta go. See you after, innit'? Oi! Hear what I'm saying to you? Sully wants to chat to you. Miss, look, I think Gem's in trouble. Stay here. Get some help. What are you doing? Leave him alone. Fuck off. Gem, get inside. I'll call the police. Fuck off. Fuck off, you stupid bitch. Oi! Pussy, man. Are you alright, Miss? You OK'? Up you get. Come on. Come inside. Let's get you cleaned up. Hey, Gem! Stop fucking running. I ain't gonna hurt you, bruv. Dog boy! When I catch you, I'm gonna fuck you up! What's happened? Some boy come for Gem and punched Miss in the face. What'?! Come on, you two. Stop chatting and get to class. Move on. Go on. You lot, clear the corridor and get to class. What's he done? I don't know. Where is he now'? He run out of school. Shit! Oi! You're pissing me off! Where the fuck are you?! Let's have a look. Gem! Oi, Gem! What do you want? Fuck you, man. Fuck off! Fuck you, pussy. Go on, fuck off! Dickhead. Fuck off! You can fuck off too. Tareek says it was them Muslim boys from Whitechapel that done Shaun. Or it might've been the Tottenham mob. It weren't no Tottenham Mob. It was Dushane. Dushane done Shaun'? Yeah, man. Dushane's done, like, loads of hits, bruv. How many hits has he done? Like, 20, 37. Gets a kill every time and the feds never catch him 'cause he's too smart for them, innit'? Him and Sully come my house the night it happened. What for'? To keep the straps. What straps? The ones they blew Shaun away with. But the news didn't say nothing about Shaun gettin' blown away. That's because the news don't know nothin'. They shot him. Thank you. Yeah? Yo, cuz. My man got away, you know, blud. What do you mean he got away? He's a fast runner, you know, blud! Listen, listen, Dris, I don't want to hear the excuses. Look, just... you find him, and when you do, bell me, yeah? Alright, cool. Keep sending him texts, but he ain't replying. Try him again. It's going straight to voice-mail. Nat, who is it? It's no-one, honey. It's me, bruv. That's alright. Let him in. Thank you. Alright, then. So, go on, what is it? Well, you're the one going through it. Listen, man, I'm your older brother. I can read you like a book, remember? I just came to check you, innit'? Just make sure you're alright and that. I haven't seen you since it happened. Look, Shane, you've gotta get yourself out of this, man. I will. When I've made enough money. You know what? You're gonna be dead before you've made enough. It ain't right you making money that way. Chris, what's wrong with you? You ain't never smoked no weed? You ain't ever done a line of coke? Where do you think all that comes from? I'm trying to make it right, here. You're not gonna make it right, are you? I mean, look at me! Listen. You're my brother and I love you, OK'? I always will. I can't let you step foot in this house again, man. I'm sorry. I didn't know about what happened with you and your dad. Don't tell no-one. I wouldn't tell anyone anything you didn't want me to, Ra'Nell. He used to beat my mum. That time when he had her in the kitchen by her throat, I picked up a knife. Don't remember what happened, but I know I stabbed him. I won't tell anyone. You've made really good progress, Lisa. We're very pleased with you. So what we have to discuss now is putting together a package of support to enable you to go home. Home? - Good. That's good news. You'll still see me as an outpatient once a week. We'll discuss any problems, any anxieties. But the important thing is to keep taking the medication. I will. Don't be tempted to stop. We'll aim to reduce the dose very, very gradually, when the time's right. Good. We think you're ready. I'm really very sorry. Yeah? There's a load of people outside the house. Yeah'? Lot of people coming in and out. But Kamale ain't one of them so far. So you're saying, what, you can't see Dwight or Ninja? What, none of Kamale's boys? No, none of them showed up neither. Alright, fam. Just keep watching. He has to turn up sooner or later, innit? Alright, cool. Boy, put the phone down and come grind the garlic! Alright, Mum. I'm coming. You're on this phone, phone, phone every minute. Just come to see my girl, isn't it? Where is she? Hello! You right, Tash'? What you doing? Who you on the phone to? Off the phone - Daddy's here! I got this. Good to see you. What you got, a chip? Yeah. Can I have it? On the mat. What are you doing, just playing? I can see the chip. You want coffee? Er, you got something cold? Yeah. I've got a present for you, you know. I've got a teddy bear for you! Look! Do you like it? Yeah. Yeah?! Give it a kiss. Now give Daddy a kiss. Mwah! You're the most beautiful girl in Hackney, you know. Marnie? Marnie, no! Wake up! Marnie! Marnie! Wake up. Wake up! Are you gonna stick around the rest of the day? Yeah. Yeah. Good. Shall I put a movie on for Tash'? What, now'? Yeah. Look. Cat. Alright. Good. Tash'? You wanna watch cartoons? Yeah. Yeah? That feed them. Can't feed no nuts. Let's see what's on. Look. Are you gonna watch cartoons? Hey, man, I'm hungry. I've got some food in my bag. Safe. Do you think the boy got him? I don't know. What are you gonna do? Go back to the flats, I suppose. Maybe Gem'll creep in later. Do you wanna come and wait with me? What, at yours? No, I'll take you somewhere else. Yeah, OK. Where are we going'? You'll see. I wouldn't like to live on my own. Neither would I. But hopefully my mum comes home soon. Do you come up here a lot? Yeah. I like it up here. I come here to think. Got something to show you. What are you thinking? I don't know. Precious... Do you wanna go out with me? Do you wanna go out with me? Yeah. OK, then. Oi. Yo, Chantelle. Yo. There's some boys there, yeah, and they're putting down flowers and that. Is it Kamale, yeah? Chantelle, come on, man - is it him or not?! I can't tell, innit, they've got their full hoodies up! What do you mean they all got hoodies on? Look good, yeah. Is it him or not? I don't know! Nah. Nah, it ain't him. It ain't Kamale. Well, are you sure? Definite, bruv. Ain't none of his boys, neither. How long we gotta stay out here, bruv? Wait there till you see him, yeah? You know, Dushane says you've gotta act like my boyfriend, so people don't get suspecting us. Are you taking the piss? Bruv, come on, you know how to act like a boyfriend to me! Fuck off, man. See, that's it! Acting like my boyfriend already. Probably wanna bocat me next, innit'? In your dreams. Dickhead. His dad said he ain't been home all day. We should call the police. I think I know where he is. Oi! Where's your bredrin, fam'? I ain't seen him. What do you mean, you ain't fuckin' seen him? Prick had me running for time. Have you seen him? She don't know him. How can she not fucking know him? They go to the same fuckin' school. What's he done, anyway'? He's a snake, innit'? He's a snake man for Kamale. What? He doesn't even know Kamale, how can he... Get off him, he's done nothing wrong! Move, man! Leave her alone. Shut your fuckin' mouth, you... Oi! What's up here, man? Who you talking to, you little... Come off the kid, come off the kid.

We got big things to think about out here. Fucking grabbing up youths on the block, what's wrong with you, man? Gem... What happened to Marnie? They killed her. Shit. Why? Why would they do that'? They think you're a snake. What? They think you told Kamale about the house that got knocked down. I'd never do that. Look, Gem, we gotta go. They might come back. You alright? Hello. That's Gem. And you must be Precious. They killed his dog. Right, get in the car. (“NO DOORS SLAM Fuck's sake. Thank you, it's really nice. You're welcome. Thanks for the food, Leon. Not gonna try any, Gem? I'd never tell on Dushane, he's my friend. What you've gotta understand is none of 'em's your friend. Not Dushane, Sully, none of 'em. They'll make you think you are so you'll do what they want. They don't care about you. Trust me, I know how they think. What are we gonna do? I'll talk to 'em. They won't listen. Don't worry. I'll sort this out. OK, guys, come on. Better get you home.
