I asked him, 'Does Sugar know about this?' -He said you were cool. -Lester seh I be cool? Yeah. That's what he said. My dogs don’t do no freelancin’. Dem work fi Sugar exclusive. Well, obviously Lester didn't understand that. And I would never have went there with him if I knew that. Pussy, me cyan't mek you leave dis prison alive. Hear dat? You're not sellin' in London, though, are you? I know you got food. I got the people. I can make you some serious money. Dis is sometin' I already have in abundance.

But don't yu have big problems over deh inna London? Oh, I definitely got problems. See how big they are when I get back, innit? So... I don't have a choice, fam. It's all I had to offer him, bro.
