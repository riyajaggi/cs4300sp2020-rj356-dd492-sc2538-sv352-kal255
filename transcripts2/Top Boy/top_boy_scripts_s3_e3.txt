What, you got fleas? What? -Fuck, are you using? -What? No, bruv. Don't fuckin' lie to me, you know. I got eyes in my head. You're fuckin' using, you're a mug. -Who got you using? -No one. Can I sit? You're looking well. Did you come here to say something? Say it. Look, I got this ting, yeah? It's a urgent ting. -I wanna bring you in on it. -Bruv, can you hear me out, yeah? -No. No. You try listening to me for a change. Aight. Go on, I'm listenin'. When I'm talkin', Dushane, don't mean you're listenin'. -Fuckin' hell, man. -Yeah, 'cause you always do it. I talk, and you just do what you decided to do already. It's disrespectful. You know I respect you, fam. I always have. Keep it real, though. From school days, man. You always said us, but you meant me. You always said it was our crew, but it was always your crew. -Anytime you said it was our plan, it was always your plan. Yeah, I think you're reading that a bit wrong, cuz. It was always us. -We were equal partners, bruv. We weren't equal. We weren't partners. Bruv, look, I thought I would've achieved so much more by now, you know? You feel me? I'm 36 years old. I ain't got no woman, no kids, fuckin' sleeping on Dris's stinkin' sofa. My mum's sick, fam. And I've got a gangster putting a gun to my head, telling me he's gonna kill my cousin if I don't come up with the ten bags. If you told me I'd be in that fuckin' situation six years ago, I would've laughed in your face. Look, man... I had a lot of time to think in Jamaica, bro. A lot of time. Whatever mindset to get to the top, you have to fuckin' fight for what you want, fam. You see, once you get there, when you're on top, that's a different ball game, fam. Then you need real people around you, and you have to keep them close. Obviously, I didn't do that. Hands up. That's what I've learned. There you go. Just doing it again, man. It's always about you, Dushane. What you've learned, what you need, what you want. I never hear my name in anything you say. Bruv, what the fuck do you want me to do? What do you want me to say? You want me to beg you? I'm trying to rectify the situation, bro. I have a connect. The supply is already pattern to sell. All I need is ten bags, down payment. So you've come to me. Bruv, the last time I saw you, you were walking away with a big fuckin' bag of money, bro. I ain't got it. So where's it gone? What happened? I got nicked. Police took it. So what you're saying to me, the feds took everything, Sully? No. I got a few bags put away, but that's for my thing. Somethin' I got going on. Yeah, well, I don't know what you got goin' on. But you see, this thing, what I'm talking about... If we do this, we're back, bro. We're unstoppable. Trust me. Yeah? Back on top. We can do it, fam. What you sayin'? No. And I ain't your family. That's how you feel, yeah? Sorry about your mum, though, for real. Yo, Jase, I didn't mean to switch on you. But don't lie to me. Okay. When I find out who got you using, I'll fuckin' kill 'em. -Aight? -Yeah. And I'll take your sandwich. -Come on, man. Where's the station? -St Pancras. Something I gotta do. Bruv, call her. -Why don't you call her? -Do you want me to call her? How do I look, Jason? What? How do I look? Hm? Dunno. Good, I suppose. Suppose. That right there's my little girl. So that's your family too. When her daddy comes home, that little girl needs to be standing in front of a hero. Not a fuckin' con in prison stink. That's all I am right now, a fuckin' broke con that stinks of jail. It ain't good enough. Whoa, bruv. Here, bruv! Next one over. Yes, fam. One ninety-five? Fam, why don't I just ask Jamie for the money? It'll be way easier. He knows your mum. So he'll give her the money. Nah, bruv, you don't understand. My mum, she would never accept that. Where she comes from, they don't accept people giving 'em money, unless they've, like, worked for it and stuff. Fam, it's calm, let's just go and make this money, man. Yeah, man, come on. We need this. -We need to do 'em before Jamie comes. -They're gonna get cool, cuz. What d'you mean, fam? If we do it quick enough, we won't get caught. I can make it. We're gonna get caught if we do it slow. -So we need to hurry up. -Yeah, that's what I'm doin'! Weren't you saying you were gonna add cheese, though? I'm not worried about cheese. I'm worried about you getting in trouble, cuz. Ready? Three, two, one. -Well done! -Wahey! Come on, come on! Ay! Ay! Open a window, man! Quick! Oh! You got the flame way too high, bruv. Move! Fam, Jamie ain't gonna like this, bruv. -Why aren't you man at school? -Teacher training. -Yeah, what he said. -Teacher training? Come on, man, I invented that excuse. -How many burgers you got here? -Thirty-six. We're gonna sell them after school. Yeah. Me and Ats are going into business. We need to make some Ps quick. -What d'you need to make that money for? -Immigration come and took my mum and say she can't work no more. She can't even claim. -What does that mean, she can't claim? It means she can't get money from nowhere, you dummy. Oh. All right, cool. You got a name for this product then? - Nah. -You gotta have a name, you know. Something that stands out. It's the first rule of marketing, fam. Hmm... -'School Burgers.' -That is so peak. - What else then? -Hey, you know what? What about 'Big Flame Burgers'? Yeah! Ay, yo, when are we getting some food, cuz? I got this ting that I wanna take out, but how am I supposed to show her a good time if I ain't got no Ps? You're gonna have to think of something youse two can do for free. Don't even ask 'cause I ain't got fuck all for youse. No, listen, man. -Didn't you hear me? Fuck off, man! -I got something to tell you. What? See that stall where that fella sells them lighters? -What about it? -He's police. -What? -We saw him. We seen him, didn't we? At the cop shop. He's Old Bill. They nicked us, innit? Said we was trying to break into some house. Took us down to Stoke Newington nick. Didn't have nothin' on us 'cause we hadn't fuckin' broken into it. We was sittin' in the corridor in the nick, and who walks past? Him. They probably nicked him and all. Nah. He was laughin' and jokin' with the other coppers. Like they was all mates. His name's Dave. -Dave, yeah? -That's what they were all callin' him. He's definitely a copper, man. Trust me. All right, go on. Fuck off. What? Ain't you gonna give me nothin' for that? -Come on, man, allow it. -I ain't got nothin' for you. Fuck off. -Mate. -Come on, man. Just give us-- Fuck off, man. -Looks like we got a little spy. -So what you wanna do? I'mma go chat to this brother. You know this guy's gonna start problems for us, innit? Might as well. We ain't got fuck all to do. Wah gwaan, brother. -Wah gwaan. -How much are the lighters? -Pound each. Three for two. -Let me get one. Don't worry. It's on the house. Been workin' here long? Do you make a livin' here? You know how it goes. Some days are better than others. I don't smoke. What'd you say your name was again? Jordan. Jordan. Where you from, Jordan? I'm livin' up in Tottenham now. But don't hold that against me. Tottenham. I won't hold that against you, Dave. But listen, there's a lot of gangsters round these ends, and if they find out what you're doin' here, they ain't gonna fuckin' like it. I'm just passing on some good advice... Dave. Listen, I don't want no one carrying anythin'. No food, no knives, nothing. I ain't got no food to carry anyway, bruv. Yo, my brother. Wah gwaan. -Mi haven't seen yu inna a while. -Yeah, man, you can see me now. Mi see yuh ugly face, yes. So how yu stay? Everyting's good, man. Hey, how's everything over there?

Aight, later. -Hi. -You all right, yeah? -Good. How are you? -I'm good. How is she? She's a bit tired today, she keeps nodding off. Do you want a tea, coffee? -Yeah. Bit of coffee. -Coffee? Black, please. ...this four-bedroom house is quite a lot of work before she could begin to realise what it's really worth on the market. But everywhere there's clutter, and this makes your house look... You all right, Mum? Not too bad. Yeah. There's your coffee. Ah, thank you. Well, time for your jab. - You'll do it for me? - Of course. Come on, then, get ready. Done. You're not saying much today. I worry about you. You don't need to worry about me. I'm sure you got better things to worry about anyway, innit. It's all right. Thanks. Go on. You all right, yeah? Yeah, I'm fine. Aight. Actually, wait. Can I ask you something? Look, your business ain't none of my business. But I hope you're not thinking about taking her money. I saw you, through the door. She thinks the world of you. It'll break her heart. I know that. Well, is there... I don't know, something I can do to help? And why would you help me? Well, if a man like you is even thinking about stealing from his mother, then that man's gotta have some troubles. Man like me? You got morals, Dushane. I can see that. You don't know me. - Big man, d'you want a burger? - D'you want a burger? Ats and Stef's Big Flame Burger! The most delicious burger you've ever had! There we go! Ay! Ay! You want a burger? Here. You, move burgers, man! Don't go. You want one? Yo! Ay! What you doing? That's what he wants it to be. Yeah, fam, yeah. And only a quid! I see you're hungry. Come down! Come down! You're hungry. You want a burger, innit? You're so poor. Get outta here, man. I haven't got a quid. It's cool. Thanks. Shut up, bro. That was, like, year three. -Shut up, bruv! -I forgot the rest. -I'll have one. -Hey, just gimme the money. Yo, bro, get away! -Yo, yo, yo. - Thank you. Ay! Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Let's count the money. Let's count it. One pound... -Three pound. That's money, yeah? -Oh, my gosh! -Ay! Ay! -Business is booming, cuz. -That's money. Profit. -I know. So depressing. Don't you think so? Yeah, well, we ain't gotta be here for long. He said he's on his way, and he's gonna meet us here still. You know, I've never even seen the sea before. Yeah, it's not really that much of a big deal. Obviously, I've seen it on TV and that, but... I've never been on a beach before. What? Not even on holiday? Never been on holiday before. I never left the fuckin' country. I'm 35 years old, I never left the country. Imagine that. I haven't, yeah? -But I don't think I'd want to either. -Why? Like, 'cause... I'd just feel like I'm out of place. See, when man was young, yeah? What we used to call a holiday, yeah, was, like, me and my little sister going to check my nan in Birmingham. That's what we used to call holidays back then. What? And you didn't go to the beach there? The beach in Birmingham, blud? -Yeah. Ain't there one? -Are you stupid? You're so du-- D'you know what? I refuse to believe that you're fuckin' serious right now. You're an arsehole, you know. All right, Sully? You havin' a swim or gettin' your toes wet? Tell you one thing, that water's always fuckin' freezin', isn't it? Fuckin' joker. What you sayin'? You good? Yeah, I'm good, mate. You? Yeah, man. You've grown. It's been a long time. So where's this yard, then? Just round the corner. You go up, do a left, do a right, it's there. Have you seen the news? You can't see who they are. Can't even see their faces. Well, that's a plus. Look, I understand the market you're selling to is different to what I'm used to, and you know how that works better than I do, but things like this, this is what gets people arrested. I was with a girl last night. Nice girl. She had nothin' to do with this. Cam drives by and opens up. Tries to lay me out and shoots her instead. Now she's shot in the neck. I can't let that go. Oh, yeah. I understand. And don't get me wrong, I knew there was gonna be problems. But I hoped you'd be able to handle them better. I just told you. Cam set me a message, I had to reply. Hm. Is Cam dead? No. So my point is, Jamie, Cam didn't get your reply. Look, I've spoken this over with Jeffrey, and we do still want to get into business with you. But we need to feel confident. It's just down at the end over here. Who's in the house? It's the immigrants, bro. They're cool, though. They won't cause no problems. -So how long you been using? -What? -Just tell me what I asked ya. -It's nothin' serious, bro. I just, you know, sometimes I take a hit every now and then. You got him on somethin'? Hm? It's a fuckin' question. D'you give him drugs? -Only a couple of times. -How many times? -Like, I think, once. I don't know. -How many times? -I don't know-- -What was it? What'd you give him? -Just weed, man, weed. -Weed? Weed? -Yeah-- -Don't fuckin' insult me. Weed? -I might've given him dark a few-- -Of course you fuckin'-- Look at him! -He didn't mean to. -Fuckin' shut up! He didn't mean to. -It was hardly ever. -He didn't mean to-- Gem, I swear, if you ever fuckin' give him anything again, I don't give a fuck what it is, you know. Weed, pills, white, B, I don't give a fuck. I'll bury you, you know. And you, you fuckin' idiot. -How stupid could you be, man? -I'm sorry. Just shut-- We don't take that shit. We don't do that! Bro, why you tellin' him for, man? Where's the house? It's there, man. So Gem's told you what we need, yeah? Gem, I swear, if you're gonna tell me this guy don't fuckin' talk English... He speaks English, man. Don't you, Faez? I explained what's gonna happen. He's cool with it. Two, three days max. All I need is somewhere to sleep. Bro, it ain't even gonna take that long. People round here, they're bare thirsty, bro. Bro! Gem, can he fuckin' understand me? I understand what you want. - Yeah? -Yeah. Well, thanks for fuckin' joining us. Listen, we're gonna stay here for as long as it takes to sell this shit, then we're gone. -You pay me for stay. - Look at me. I pay you for stay. You pay me now. Is he mad? Hm? Is he on fuckin' drugs? -You been givin' him shit? -Doesn't even do drugs, Faez. -He don't do drugs? -No. -Why's he got that junkie look then? -He's a different kind of hungry. He's hungry 'cause he ain't got food to eat. You pay some now. No, that's not how it works. I pay you when I leave. You don't tell no one we're here. Yeah? No one. Now, do you get that? -Yes. -Okay, good. Go. Go get a tea or somethin', man. How we gonna tell the customers the shop's open? Don't worry about that. -Don't worry? -No. Don't worry about that. Fuckin' knobheads! Go back home, you fuckin' pussy! Cunts! The joke is it'll be them lot lining up to get their food tonight. That's a funny thing? -Where's the toilet in this place? - Downstairs, man. So sorry. Just heard a noise. Man had an undy at that stall there, then the youts clocked him in the station. So where is he now? Obviously, man had a little chat with him, innit, bruv. Make sure none of these lot are holding anything, you know. Yeah, I spoke to them already, but we're gonna have a problem when the food comes in. There's already an issue with that. My man wants a deposit. Ten bags. And? And I want you to get it. What? Bro, you need to start fuckin' pullin' your weight. What you sayin'? I don't pull my fuckin' weight round here? Dris, I need ten bags. I don't care how you get it. - Bruv, what the fuck's his problem? -Shut your fuckin' mouth, man. Flash prick, you know. The fuck you let him talk to you like that? - Comin' in! Bruv, what's wrong with you? Get out, man. -You can't see man's in the bath? -I got my history essay back, you know. Miss said one of the best in the class. I might study history at uni, you know. But not if, like, the record deal comes in, 'cause being a recording artist is way better than doing history. It's less boring. Do you know about the Reformation? Bro, I need some privacy. You get me? Yeah, my history essay was about the Reformation and King Henry VIII. King Henry VIII was some fat guy. Yeah, he had, like, six wives. Chopped off all their heads. Miss said one of the best in the class. Even better than Ats's. Wait, why are you telling me all of this? 'Cause you like it when I do somethin' good. Stefan, what have you done? Nothin'. Stef, you know better than to tell me lies, innit? Me and Ats... We missed school. So that's what the school was calling me about today. I never even picked up. Ats's mum got kicked out of her job. And Immigration came by the yard, saying that she not allowed to be in the country no more. So what's that got to do with you missing school? So we decided to make a business plan, me and Ats. So she can have extra Ps. Pay for the rent and stuff. So, we decided to sell burgers to the kids in school. -Burgers? -Yeah, for a pound each. Listen, just make sure you don't miss school again. And make sure you catch up with all the lessons that you missed today, yeah? Ay, ay, ay. -Who's Tilly? -Nothing, man! Hurry up and get out. -Get out. -Ay, what? Hurry up, man! Hello? Who's this? I said, who's this? You like your dinner? I got something for you. For me? You've got something for me? Close your eyes. What are you doing? Close your eyes. It'll be a surprise. Okay. Okay. You can open them now. What is this? It's money. I know it's money. Where did you get it? Me and Stef, we sold burgers. We made burgers and sold 'em. This is the profit. I thought it would make you happy. Listen, you know you never have to worry. I'll always be here for you. -You know that? -I know. - Wah gwaan. - You all right? -Wah gwaan. -Dris told me I had to get him ten bags. Said it was for you. -So you got the ten bags, yeah? - No, not on me. But she knows where to get it. There's this woman and she lives in the borough, but, like, not Summerhouse, down near the Common. And this woman has a lot of money. -And? -She's got a lotta tom. Keeps it in the house. And guess what? She ain't even in the house now. She's in her other house in the south of France. Who else lives in her yard? Just the daughter, innit. But she's with her in France. -No husband? -Nah. She got rid of him last year. He weren't pullin' his weight, economically speaking. Well, obviously, the house is gonna be belled up by now, innit? Nah, man. This woman is so clueless when it comes to anything practical. She can't even work a dishwasher or a TV. She kept trippin' the alarm, so she don't use it no more. By the door, there's, like, a stone hedgehog, some, like, ornament ting. Keys are underneath. You wouldn't even have to break in. For real, yeah? -Yeah, man. -Pound. How do you lot know her? Shelley, innit. She does the woman's shellacs and beauty treatments. Aight, man. Cool. - It's like that, yeah? -Mm-hmm. No cup of tea, nothin'. Fuck's sake. All right, Dris. Yo. Bruv, get a car and come and pick me up, yeah? You know what? I've never burgled a house before, you know? Anyone comes, make sure you text me, yeah? You're good, fam. Nah. My brain can't handle any more Chaucer. Come over to mine, and we can do it together. Yeah, and then we can watch a movie. No, I promise we won't get caught. If you stay over, we can tidy up in the morning. Yes, you know what, I will. I'll just invite everyone else. Yeah, then we can watch a movie. If you bring the popcorn and drinks, 'cause my mum's away. I think there's someone in the house. I'm calling the police! Bruv, didn't I tell you to fuckin' text me or s-- Yo. Yo! Yo, fam! Dris! Fuck! Fam, come on. Come on, brother. Fuck. Fuck's sake. Shit. Now they're gonna know the food's here, fam. Big man ting. Oi. Oi, bro. Save some for me, bro. Go on. Light, light, light. -Yo, what are you man doing? - Quick, bruv. Oh, shit. I swear, I'll knock one of you fuckers out. -Why are you doing that to me? You fuckin' idiot. You little shit! Aight, aight, it's cool! Aight, you man-- Hello. Yeah, I'm here to see someone. -They said I should be here. -What's the name? Tilly. Tilly Peters. The doctor's in with Tilly Peters now. I think he's just finishing up. Just be a minute. Would you like to take a seat? There she is. Thank you. Who are you? I'm Tilly's dad. She suffered brain damage. See, you look at her. They said they don't know how bad it is. She's my child. She's all I've got. I don't know anything about you. I don't want to know anything about you either. I'm glad you've seen her, just so maybe you'll know what happens to people. To flesh and blood. Innocent people. Just because you and your friends wanna make some easy money. Don't come back. Thanks, mate. Been proper hard on you, innit? Yeah. Hey, listen. See, when man was in jail, and that, and you were shouting me, mad respect for that. I've got you, bro. Just like how you've always had me, man. How's your mum? She died. She-- What? She died. What do you mean, she died? Bro? You didn't tell me that. Just didn't think you would wanna know. What the fuck, man? What happened? How'd she die? Well, her and this fella, they went out. It started raining. They got cold and came home and put the oven on. -The oven? -Yeah. And what happened? To get warm, innit. Jase, you're fuckin' losin' me here, bro. If they were cold, why didn't they put the fire on? Can't. The fire was electric and the oven was gas. And the electric was cut. And the oven was on. No, the gas was off. No. Never mind. Fuck that. What happened to your mum? Well, they put the oven on to warm their feet, but obviously, they got high. And they fell asleep, and their feet got burnt. And that's how she died? Like that? No, she didn't die till later. Basically, she got a septic in her foot, or somethin' like that. And then she got poison in the blood. And her foot went all green, and that's how she died. But the fella, he's still alive. I seen him the other day. He's got an amputated leg, and he's on crutches. Fuckin' mad. Jase, what you're telling me is fuckin' nuts. It is what it is. You ain't got no luck in life, innit? Look, if you could have anything, yeah, -what would it be? -Anything? If you could do anything, have anything, what would it be? I want superpowers, just like Spider-Man. Fuckin' hell. You're mad. Not superpowers. Like, in the real world. Like, something you could really have. You know what? To go watch Arsenal play, 'cause they're the best fuckin' team in the whole Premier League. -To go and watch Arsenal. -Yeah.
