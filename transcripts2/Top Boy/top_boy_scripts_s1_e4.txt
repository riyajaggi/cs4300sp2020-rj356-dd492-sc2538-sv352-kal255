He ain't that smart, blud, or he wouldn't have said nuttin'. 'Cause he ain't gonna have that farm for long. Why pay 20 bags for somethin' that I could take for free'? That thing is gone, cuz. It was a personality clash, Joe. It's sorted now. Personality clash? Lee was shot fuckin' dead. That's how it got sorted. From where I'm sittin', it doesn't look sorted. Looks like a big fuckin' mess. Lee wasn't being straight with me. It had to happen. This kid Dushane, he's a good soldier. He's hungry. He's a lot smarter than Lee was, and he's gonna make us a lot of money. Pat's very pissed off, Bobby. You see, he doesn't like noise and you're becoming a noisy fucker. So we're gonna stop dealin' with ya while you're getting all this attention from the police. This'll blow over. Listen, you flash Cockney prick, you sort it out, then we'll talk. Otherwise, you can go and deal with the fucking Turks. Yo, yo, what's that'? Bruv, you strapped? Chill out, man. What the fuck you mean, chill out? You fuckin' mad? Mad? If Ninja comes to stab me, I'm shootin' him fuckin' dead. That better not be the strap you popped Lee with. You know what's gonna happen if you get caught with that gun? Life. That's 30 years, minimum. I ain't gonna get caught, am I'? Wha gwan'? Wha gwan. Dris, what you sayin"? Dead out here, bruv. From mornin' man can't burst no shots. Can't make no money out here, bruv. Pissed off, man. Yeah? You and me need to talk. Come down the snooker hall at 7:00. Alright. Just you. Who was that'? Raikes. Wants to meet. Fuck it. He just wants to meet me, though. What do ya mean, he only wants to meet you? That's what he said, innit'? What do you mean? Bruv, I don't know. We're meant to be fucking doing this shit together, Shane. Why didn't you tell him that'? I'll tell him when I see him. You look ready to pop, girl. Can you believe it? Aw... I'm sorry I didn't come and visit you in hospital. It's fine. I wouldn't have come to see me either, the way I was. It's not fine, though, is it? I haven't seen you for a year. Can't let it happen again. It was Wayne, though, innit'? I couldn't have any friends. Can't believe I let him put me through that, you know. He's gone now. I don't know why, but I never thought you'd have children. Neither did I. Look, you won't regret it. Having Ra'Nell's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Ra'Nell's a lovely kid, Lisa. You've done a good job there. Yeah, but the job ain't finished yet, is it? Just getting into the difficult bit. There's a lot of temptation around. You've seen all them dealers on the estate. Shall we grab a coffee? Yeah. Yeah? Why not? Come on, then. Babe, are you alright? I don't know. I'm actually in a lot of pain. You want me to call somebody? No, it's OK. Are you sure? What was that'? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on. Heather, let me get you to the hospital. Go on, what's up? Just wondered if you'd been makin' any money'? There's feds all over the place right now. Exactly. And whose fault is that'? You and Sully have been making a lot of noise out there. It's bad for business. Everyone's suffering. So you got any ideas how we might get outta this recession? Sit tight and ride it out, innit'? Now, that's not gonna happen, son. You see, the Old Bill need to be seen to be solvin' the occasional crime. You need to feed the beast, Dushane. Give them someone. No way. You wanted a good life. Yeah, and what's that got to do with this? Well, I've been in this game over 20 years. The rate you're going, you ain't got much longer. And Sully, he's the one that's standing in your way and stopping you from having a good life. He's hanging on your coat-tails, son, and he's an 'eavy weight. Listen to me, I ain't giving him up. Yeah, well, your friend is gonna drag you down. Think about it. I already have thought about it. Well, think about it some more? You the cutter? Yeah. Where's the woman? She sent me. Hello, Mum. Ra'Nell, listen Fm with Heathen. Why, what's happened? She's in the hospital. She's having her baby. OK. Look, I won't be home for a bit. Will you be alright? Yeah. OK. Where are you? I'm doin' my homework, innit'? Are you sure? Yes. Good boy. I'll call you later, yeah? Alright, 'bye. Alright, babe. Love you. 'Bye. Can I have a picture? What? A sample. Alright, safe. Yo. I've got the picture. Come, man. Sit down there, bruv. It's got to be worth 20, innit'? You want a drink? You know what? You're a smart yout, you know. I don't know why you ain't rollin' with my team. 'Cause I'm smart. Go on, fam. I'll give you a bell, yeah? Alright, cool. Same again. What you sayin"? What? Hear what I'm sayin' now. My man brought the weed, innit'? He came through? Fuck off! Yeah, and it's good, it's good Proper tings, bruv. Proper tings? Yeah, get about five key of that. What, for nothing, yeah? Nah, not for nothing. Bruv, listen, I'm tellin' you, I like the yout. I think he's cool. I want him to run with man, you get me? Alright. No-one don't touch him. You wanna pay him, innit'? Yeah! Fuck it, we do it your way, we do it your way. Serious! Yo! What, bruv? See that little Ra'Nell? I want you to follow him, yeah, find out where the farm is, yeah? No problem, fam. Fuck all that shit. Back that. Oi, Ra'Nell! Come here. The weed's good. Bring it to me tonight, yeah? We'll have the money for you. 20'? Yeah, 20. Alright, cool. Oi, oi! It's cool this time and that, yeah. But if you wanna be doin' business in Summerhouse, you can't be independent. I told you I ain't joinin' your gang. So, what, you think I'm gonna sit back and let you become the competition? That can't happen either. What was that all about? Don't worry, man. Jordan... this is Ra'Nell. Wha gwan, Jordan? He's small, innit'? Bit premature. Couldn't wait to come out. Did the cutter come? Yeah. It's all bagged up. Just over five key. Talk about bad timing. Listen, Ra'Nell, this is the last time I'm gonna ask you to do this, I swear. I'll call Vincent. Can you meet him at the flat?

Look, remember that thing we was talkin' about, yeah? You were right. The weight is dragging me down now. You're making the right decision. Yeah. Look, I got the gun he done Lee Greene with as well. Even better. I'll take care of it for you. I'll let you know where to meet. Did you recognise them? They were two boys. I didn't recognise no faces. Do you remember what they were wearing? Can you remember anything at all? You've made the right decision, son. You and me are gonna make a lot of money for each other. You just have to trust me. Did you bring the thing? Yeah, I got it. Give it to me. I'll take care of everything. You get rid of it, yeah? Look on the bright side, man. At least we got five keys of weed for free. Fuck the weed! You're gonna fucking start behaving yourself. What the fuck are you doing, bruv? Raikes is dead. Yeah. He's dead. I did it. Just now. Why? Why? 'Cause he fucking wanted you dead, fam. He wanted me to set you up 'cause you're a fucking liability. And you know what? I had the same idea. But you're my boy, and I ain't gonna do you none no matter how fucking stupid you are. Shane, man. Dushane, man! Listen, bruv, from now on, yeah, things are gonna run differently round here. Understand? Babe, I'm gonna run you a bath, alright? Ra'Nell, your bath's... Ra'Nell'?

Fuck you, what are you talking about? Fuck you. I've been backing you all the way, bruv! All the fucking way! Ra'Nell! Ra'Nell! I was fucking backing you! Get off him! Ra'Nell, give me the knife. Give me the knife, Ra'Nell. Please... let go of the knife, Ra'Nell. Don't you ever go near my son again. You don't talk to him, you don't look at him, you don't go anywhere fucking near him. Do you understand? Do you understand?! Yeah. Come on. This the first time you've bunked school? Yeah. Bet you're gonna bunk all the time now. Hold up! What? Dushane said to give you this. Hope you get your flat. Feels like Bobby Raikes was giftwrapped for the police. Convenient, don't you think? I think Raikes was a dinosaur who brought too much heat on himself and everyone around him. Now, you wanna do business or not? How much do you need? Ten key. Let's start with five. When? Wednesday. You picking up? He will. He'll have the money'? He'll have it. Then it's done. You want me to help set up, I help. What's it gonna cost'? Material, equipment, 10,000. You have 10,000'? No, we ain't got 10,000. OK. I tell you what I do. I do everything for free, I take the first crop. What, just the first crop? First crop only. Rest is yours. Deal? Yeah. Deal! Yeah! OK'? Boom! Easy money! Easy money.
