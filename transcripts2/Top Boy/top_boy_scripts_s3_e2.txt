 Sayer ya nah. Big sayer, nah? Some more beans, yeah? Keep it up, Sullivan. You might think you're getting out on Friday, but I'm the man who makes that Friday next year, or the year after. All I have to do is get you up on charges and have you down in the seg before your feet touch the ground. And trust me, son, I'd love to do that. In here. Just give me a reason, and I'll do it. For fuck's sake. Hey, yo, Stef, was you in my room? -Nah. -Have you been in my room? No, I don't go in your room. Why, what's wrong? Nothing. You're good, don't worry. Don't forget, it's parents' evening tonight. Remember! Yeah. And don't forget to chat to my teacher, Mr Evans. -Thinks he's bare funny. Well, I better hear good things from the other teachers then, yeah? You was in my room last night, and you took some money. Don't even think about lying to me right now, Aaron. - All right man, I'm sorry. -Why'd you take it? -Look, I said I'm sorry, man. -Shut up. I said why? Some girl at uni, innit? Fam, just wanted to take her out, show her a good time. Wait, let me get this straight. So you took my money for a girl? -Bruv, I don't have any money on me. -Where is it? -I just-- -Where the fuck's the money? All right. Listen, don't go in my room. -I won't. -D'you understand?

What's this all about, if you don't mind me asking? It would be easier if we could discuss it inside, madam. Okay. We have reason to believe you do not have the legal right to be in this country. I've lived in this country for 18 years. I've been to Immigration. They said I could stay. My papers are correct. Do you work, Amma? Do you have a job? Of course, I've always worked. -Where do you currently work, Amma? -At the hospital. -Are you a nurse? -I work in ancillary services. So you're a cleaner?

My meeting went long. Putting together a consortium of investors to redevelop one of the local estates, like a total regeneration. Where did we get to? So basically, we're gonna need a supply, and it's gonna have to be regular. If I don't deliver to my people, they'll go somewhere else. Totally understood. Basic business principles. Does 15 kilos a month sound like a regular supply to you? Fifteen kilos? Phew. That's a lot of blow. Gonna put a big smile on a lot of faces. Well, I'm assuming you can handle it. Jeffrey and me were thinking that if this works out, we can bring you a lot more. We can handle it. -But, fam, 15 kilos? How we gonna move that? Set up a meeting with Cam, innit. Somewhere neutral. A-Road? Are you insane, cuz? G, Cam got his food off the Turks, nah? So he's gonna be like everyone else, gonna be dry. -Bro, man. Use your head, man! -Gonna be dry! If you go to Cam saying we have a supplier, you know what's gonna happen, right? He'll do to us what we done to the Turks. And it'll be him and Lizzie squeezin' into that bathroom. I saw that. You know I got eyes on the back of my head. G, you know you're sounding like your mum right now. It's Cam, man. Bruv, I told you already about this yout, fam. He's unstable, fam. He's unstable, anyting-- Bro, opportunities like this come once in a fucking lifetime. It's either we take it now, or we spend the rest of our life living in regret. Come on, bro, man. Money season, B. Yo, square it, square it! Here, baby. Can you open that for me? Trust me, you're gonna love this ting. Fiver. -What? -Oh, my G-- What are you doin'-- Crackhead. What you man doing? -What does it look like to you? -Nah, nah, nah. You man are fucking violating. Take your shit out of my cell, man. -Get the fuck out of my cell, man. -Do you know who you're fucking with, G?

It's what Jamaica does to you, fam. And furthermore, you can't really talk. Your stomach is, like, two times the size of mine, bro. -Fam... Put on a bit of weight, hair's goin'. -Fuckin' hell. -Stress, fam. Anyway, forget that. How was Jamaica anyway? It's hard out there, bro. Supply's been dead since the Turks got wiped out. It's mayhem, innit? Every few months, you never know who you're dealing with. And when someone new comes along, they up the price. It's getting hard to make a living out here.

I just want to see a bit of improvement, maybe, in concentration in class next term. But apart from that, I think that you're progressing rather well, actually. Just like his dad. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, take care. - Put your phone away, man. -I'm just texting Aaron, bruv. Forget him, it's our turn. Take a seat. Hi, I'm Ms Griffiths. I'm Stefan's head of year and he's in my history class. So, Stefan, how do you think you're doing? I don't know. - Do you enjoy history? -No. Hey, don't be rude, little man. Okay, let's have a look. -Attendance-- -I make sure he doesn't miss school. And attendance is 100%. -Homework is a two. -One's the best. Organisation is two. Concentration is three, behaviour three. So he's doing good? -There's room for improvement. -All right. Well, he's gonna improve, trust me. Ain't that right, little man? So he's in a nice friendship group too. I mean, you're friends with Ats, aren't you? -Yeah, he's my bro. -Yeah, Ats sets a very good example. Next time I'm here, I wanna hear you're doing as well as Ats, yeah? So next term, each student is gonna be doing a family tree. It's just a way of personalising history for them. Is that okay? Can I not do it? Nah, bruv. You can do it. -Excellent. -Yeah? -Well, nice to meet you. Take care. -Thank you very much. Nice to meet you. -See you tomorrow, Stefan. - All right, who's next? Mr Evans. He don't like me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Okay, see you tomorrow. -Bye. -Are you okay? -Yeah. -Hey. -Hello. Are teachers calm? Yeah, I got all ones in history still. No, you got one one in history. The rest were threes. Nah, he's lying, I got a two as well. The teachers were saying how smart Ats is though. You all right though, Amma? Is everything okay? I pray it will be okay. What's up? You have enough to worry about, Jamie. Stefan's a good boy. I have to get to work now, yeah? -Please be safe, yeah? See you later. -Thank you. Hold it there. Hi, are you a relative? -Brother. -Ah, okay. So... Stefan. Why don't you tell me how you think you're getting on? Well, it's not going very well, is it? I'm looking at the scores here you've given, they ain't very good. Well, I'm afraid Stefan isn't putting in the effort. How come? 'Cause all the other teachers are giving him higher marks. What that says to me is you're the odd one out, do you get it? Which means it ain't about him, it's about you. Stefan also says you're very sarcastic. Nobody likes sarcasm, do you understand? Erm... Well, maybe we could look at some of Stefan's marks again. I got all ones in parents' evening, except geography. Well, that's cool, man. Yo, Stefan was born at one o'clock in the morning, you know. Ten o'clock, Mum rang Dad, told him to come pick her up. So we all went down to the hospital. Mum couldn't wait to get out of there. August 26th, my birthday. Yeah. So we come here to this garden, sat on this bench. Was looking at the new baby. Me? And this lady, like an older lady, walks past. But then she came over. She's like to Mum, 'How old's that baby?' Mum said, 'He was born this morning.' The lady started busting at us, she couldn't believe it. She said back in her day, you'd have to spend, what, two weeks in hospital before you could come out? Mum was so strong, man. Yeah, now I'm deep in it, she weren't ever ill. Never even had a cold. Dad too. He was strong. He was a real man. When he spoke, everyone listened. Yeah, man. That's why we come here, innit, on their birthdays. Happy birthday, Mum. Happy birthday, Mum. Don't worry, man, you're good. You're a good boy. Yo, you're too big for all of that, man. -We're brothers though, right? -Yeah, man. Tell me about this girl. What's her name? The one that you wanted to take on a date. -Her name's Abby. -Yeah. Abby, yeah? Well, you take Abby someplace nice, show her a good time, yeah? -Thanks, man. This is for you, little man, for making me proud of you today at school. You done well. Now, go home. I gotta make a couple phone calls, innit? -All right, laters, yeah? -Love. Hold it. Everything cool though, yeah? Yeah, man. Everything's crystal. Love, yeah? Mm. -Safe, yeah? -Love. Get home safe. Amma. Hello. Have you had contact with Immigration Service recently? I... Yes. Maybe we should sit down. I'm afraid that... I don't know how to say this to you, Amma, but we're gonna have to terminate your employment. I am really sorry. I don't think I understand what you're saying. We've had official notification from the Home Office. The Trust would be in breach of the law if you continue to work here. -How could this happen? -I'm so sorry. Don't say this, please. I am so sorry. -Relax. - Is that it? Chill, play the game. Piss me off, swear to God. Bow, miss a goal. Bow, you're dead. Bro, hurry up, I can see the card already. Yo, stop watching my cards, fam. -What you chatting about? -Hurry up, bro. Yes. -Here we go, bruv. Here we go, bruv. -Come on, blud. Why're you so quiet? Lock up! Lock up! Bro, I don't bang judge, judge bangs me. I'm gonna use these cigs. Next time you speak to your baby mum, tell her. Tell her. I'm gonna be way calmer on the phone, way calmer. Composure, lads. Composure! Respect me! Oi! -Shh! Fucking pussy, now. -Fuck! Everybody, in your cells. Move! Move, move, move! Get in your cells now, gentlemen, come on! Hey! What the fuck you doing? Lock on! Lock on! I ain't done shit. You're okay. We'll get you sorted out. -Okay, you're okay. The first shipment is five bags of white and five dark. Now, here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna call you with the location and the exact time. You're gonna come and pick it up. If you are one minute early, you ain't getting your drugs. If you are one minute late, you ain't getting your drugs. If you don't have the money, you ain't getting your drugs. What money you talking about? The deposit, ten grand. If I don't see that deposit, you ain't getting your drugs. You feel me? Once you've got the food, it's your responsibility. You owe what you owe, and Sugar will collect what's his. And that includes that boy back in Jamaica. You are charged with assaulting a fellow prisoner. This adjudication will determine the truth of the allegation. If you are found guilty, you'll be awarded additional days to your sentence and/or time in isolation. -How do you plead? -Not guilty. Look, my release date's tomorrow, as... as you know. Why would I do something so stupid that's gonna stop me getting out? Hmm? Never make no sense. Plus, Modie, I know Modie. Basically a friend of mine. I respect him, so... he respects me. Where were you when the attack took place? I was reading a magazine, in my cell, where three screws dragged me out of my bed and brought me down here. You ain't writing that down. So let me ask you this. Who does Modie say done it? Does he say it's me? I bet he don't. Does anyone else say it's me? 'Cause if they do, I got the right to hear them, down here, say it in front of me, to my face. And if you can't bring anyone down here, which I don't think you can, that tells me that you lot ain't got no witnesses. The assailant used a plastic bowl to scald the inmate. -Left his fingerprints on the bowl. -Did you find my fingerprints on the bowl? -No. Is that because you used gloves? -No, it's 'cause I didn't do it. So you ain't got my prints, no forensics, no CCTV, no witnesses, the victim clearly ain't ID'd me... What the fuck am I doin' here? You'll be informed of Adjudication's decision tomorrow morning. I can go? Yo, what you saying? Jump in, let's go, man. I'm not getting in that car. But these are my friends, they're cool. Don't worry about nothin'. Jump in. We're gonna go to a club or something. I'm not getting in that car with your friends. - She knows she cold outside. - She ain't getting in the car. Listen, you man, she wants you lot to jump out the car. -I'm begging youse do that for me. -Wait, what? Brother, she don't want your ugly face in the car, just jump out. You too, Si, man. Just do that for me, please. -Is that cool? -All right, bruv. -Say nothin', say nothin'. -These two are jumping out. Listen, bro, she ain't even trying to hear it, you know? You're joking, innit? Come on, man, yeah? Do that for me, bro. Listen, it's just me now. What, you gonna jump in? You should get in the car, man. He's a genuine guy, you know. Blud, you owe me one. You best be doing something, man. Aight, Jamie is sick. Who's that? -What? Oh, shit! Fuckin'-- Oh, shit! - What the fuck? - Who's that? Who's that? Fuck! Who was that? Who the fuck was that though? Fuck! Fuck them! Good morning. Good morning. Can I get your name, date of birth and prison number, please? Gerard Sullivan, 13th of the second, 1984. 81910593. Big day. I need you to sign a couple of forms for me, give you your discharge grant. If you could sign there and there, please. Now, how are your relationships with your friends and family? Have your relations suffered while you've been in prison? Because if they have broken down, it's... it's not too late to build bridges. If your friends and family know you've made progress in prison, -particularly in terms of addressing-- -Bro. What else have I got to sign, please? It's important that you don't dismiss that as an option, Sullivan. Is there anything else? You can sign there for the discharge grant. It's Â£46. -You can count it if you like. -Actually will. -What you saying? -Yeah. Come on, man. -You good? -Yeah, man. I'm good, how are you? -I'm all right. -Good. Good, man. Looking big. Look at yourself, man. What you saying, how was it? Fucking shit.
