It's making you depressed. I'm going to paint it for you. Ra'Nell! Ra'Nell, it's Gem! Kamale come in and took the food. That's not my problem. I got to tell Bobby that you let Kamale come and take his food away. Hold on, Lee, we done warned you about Kamale and them London Fields, man. Dushane, you're not listening.

Some of them even had to get jobs. It's that Chip and PIN, man - it's made it hard for all of us. Even the Postman. Used to be you could get a postman easy, but now they're all scared - they check up on them now. What you saying? I might need this real quick, bruv. I'll talk to my postman. Why don't you do that, then? Femi! That didn't sound too positive. He'll come through. Fucking hope so, mate. CHILDREN CHATTER You want that bit? Want me to weigh that for you?

(I don't want no-one looking at me.) Stop it! Don't look at me! CLATTERING You OK? Can I help you? Oh, my gosh! 'Do you have a history of mental illness, Lisa?' OK, we think the best thing would be for you to come in. Is there anyone at home? Do you have you any children? Lisa? Because obviously, if you did, we'd need to see about their care. I ain't got no children. PHONE CHIMES It's Precious again, man. You're a liar! Why would I lie? Hey, Dushane, wha gwan for my man, Ra'Nell? Who is he? Shanked up his dad last year. What, that's Wayne Smith's kid? Yeah, cuz. You know who I am, innit. Everybody knows you, Dushane. Come here. I want to ask you something. Ain't it about time you started rolling with us? I can't do that. My mum wouldn't like it. Look, hold that. What's wrong with you? You don't want the money? All right, all right. You know what? It's cool. Cool. Listen. Anyone bullying you or disrespecting you, you let me know, yeah? I'll sort that out for you. Smart yout'. Bruv, what's wrong with you? If someone offers you money, take it. Especially when it's someone like Dushane. That's you, not me, innit. DOOR CLOSES Mum. Mum... Mum! I don't smell no jerk chicken, bruv. She's not even here, bruv. Stop. You all right? You want to go down the chippie and get something to eat? Nah, man. I'll wait for my mum. You go, innit. Nah, it's cool, I'll wait with you. Gem. Gem, wake up. Gem, you should go home.

Pin, code ten, everything. But you have something for me, yeah? I will have. What? Give me three days, I'll get it. Are you trying to boy me off? I already paid my postman. What the fuck's your problem, blood? You ain't takin' no risks. It's man that's puttin' in the work out here. I want my money, Dushane. It's free money, man. Chill out. Fucking ponce. All right, Kerry? Hiya. I'm fine, how are you? Anything new for today? No, it's all exactly the same as yesterday. Cool. Lisa? Lisa, it's Leon. When did you come in here, Lise? Lisa, how long you been in here? Someone lookin' after Ra'Nell? What you doin', man? We're going to need brushes, innit. You know what, I can't even afford this. Shit, they're taking the piss. Ra'Nell? Hello, Ra'Nell. Oh, you all right, Heather? All right? What ya doing? Painting my mum's room. What colour? Loyal wheat. That's nice. Are you pregnant or just fat? Hey, shut up, man. Seven months, only two to go. Have you done the scan? Listen to you talking about scans and stuff. Why do you need all them lights? I'm doing up a flat and there's not much natural light in there. Be well bright with all of them. Yeah. I'm guessing it will be. You boys got five minutes? Yeah. Come on, you can help me with this stuff to the car. Here, take that. Nah, you're all right. Thank you. Man, what ya doin'? Oh, he's all right. You deserve it. Thank you, boys. Say hello to your mum for me. Yeah, I will. She's a milf. Shut up, man. What, so you're telling me THEY LAUGH Flat this big, you get a very good crop. Very good crop. Don't worry. You don't have to do nothing. I take care of everything. Cool. You're a friend of my dad's. I was, I ain't seen Wayne in a long time. How do I know you're not lying? You don't, you're just going to have to trust me. I'm here about your mum. What about my mum? She's OK, but she's in hospital. What do you mean she's in hospital? Don't worry, she's not sick. She'll be all right. I brought you some jerk chicken. You better save me some, y'know! I'm guessing you don't want to stay with your dad? No. I don't even know where the fuck he is. Thing is, if you ain't got no-one to stay with, no family or nothin', they're going to put you into care. That's why your mum never told the doctors about you. I'm not going into care, I can look after myself. But she might not be back for a while. I said I ain't going into care! OK. This is what we're going to do. You're going to stay here. But under my terms, yeah? Right, you go to school every day. You keep yourself and this place clean for your mum. No hanging out on the estate and you go to your bed at night - early. That's the deal. Now, can you cook? I can bring you some stuff you can heat up. When do I get to visit her? That's going to be tricky, cos if the doctors see you, they put two and two together and... I'll see what I can do. If I write a note, would you give it to her? Yeah, course. Now eat up. LOUD MUSIC INAUDIBLE CHATTER LOUD MUSIC CONTINUES What the fuck's he doing here? Who's that, Lee? Soldier outta Summerhouse. Is he the one that lost our bit of grub? Yeah, that's the cunt. You've got fucking cheek. What ya doin'? Came to give Bobby his paper. I want to give it to him personally. Give me the fucking paper, mate. Go on, go on, gimme. Fuck you, you cunt. Sit down. What's your name, kid? Dushane. Yeah. It don't want to be shy. It's all there, man. You got two minutes. Let me ask you a question, yeah? Feds know people are buying and selling in Hackney. Now, as long as we don't make no noise, they don't really care. It's part of the fabric of life, innit? Fabric of life? Look, this is all very interesting but... Let me run Summerhouse. That position's filled, you know that. I ain't dubbing Lee or nothin', but you think Kamale and them London Fields boys can come in to Summerhouse if Lee is doing his job right? But that don't change what happened, man, and it shouldn't have happened. So what do you want from me? Eight ounces of brown, to start. Eight? I can move that easy. So you want to do business with me, yeah? That's right. Why? I want a life. But you're breathing, ain't you? I want a good life. I was born and bred in Summerhouse. I'm 26 years old. I got nothing else to be, 'cept this. I was born in Summerhouse. We going to do business or what? 'Light, very important.' Always keep this distance from here. What about the water? Water is here. Pump is always on. You like gardening? I love gardening but it's not like growing tomatoes. Same, same but different. You don't go to prison for growing tomatoes! Most important thing not to go to prison is smell. Smell? Smell from plant very strong. Extractor take away the smell. How long does it take to grow a crop? 13 weeks. When you grow, you must always have shiny leaf. Dark green. Pale, no good. Yellow, no good. Means you not feed it right. Every day, you check the pH water. Temperature. Make sure pump is always working. Shiny, shiny leaf. You want, I buy your crop off you. What you going to give me for it? I give you good price. What price? Good price. No, Vincent, I need the exact price. What's goin' on? What's happenin'? All right? What's this? There's a name in there. It's got to be this one, the right one. Y'all right, girl? What ya saying? Ra'Nell put some clothes together for you. He asked me to give you this. He's a good kid, ya know. He's got some fire in his belly. He's all right. Listen, Lis. And that's all right for now. But I've seen too many people stay doped up on these things, and that ain't no way to get better, trust me. So, when you're feeling up to it, I want you to come to the gym and train. It'll do you good, and don't worry about Ra'Nell. I'll look after him. It'll be all right. If your mum doesn't come home tonight, you going to tell someone? I don't need to, I already know where she is. Where? Come on, tell me. They put her in a mental hospital. No. When is she coming home? I don't know. Shit. She'll be all right though, yeah? Yeah, hopefully. Can't even visit her. If they found out about me, they'd put me in care. So don't be telling no one, bro. I won't. Marnie! 'Keep your head still, bro.' I'm talking. How am I supposed to talk if I can't move my head? I can talk without moving my head, watch me. Did you see my head move? That's cos you're talking shit, cuz. My head moves when I talk cos I talk important shit. To fuck up my hair. You're done. Nah, nah, I'm not done, Fam, look. Are you Rossie? Who's asking? Come on, man. What's wrong with you? Hurry up. Fucking open it! Keep still, man. Fuckin' hold him down. What? It's the wrong finger. Bruv, they ain't gonna know the fucking difference. Of course they'll know the fuckin' difference, bruv, look. They look the same to me. I'm telling you, you need to get the right finger. You saying I need to cut the other finger off now? Attention to detail, innit? Come on. You're sick. Come on. My sister's kid, 17 years old, got a glass eye, all because this got poked in his face. Now a situation has become vacant. My mate here, Lee, he's moving up. Congratulations. So that means that you two and me are going to do business together, but we're going to do business exactly how I say. Because what this is, is a special relationship. I'm trusting you with my food. You can trust us. I know that I can trust you. Because I know who your family are. Give 'em the parcel. Bring me the paper in a week. What about Kamale? What about him? You're running Summerhouse now. Whatever you feel to do, fine by me. What you saying, cuz? Nah chill man, jam. I came to tell you we're running Summerhouse now. All them stunts you pulled before, coming in and taking man's food, can't happen again, understand? What about Lee Greene? Don't worry about Lee Greene, he's moved on. What ya doing, man?! Stay the fuck out of Summerhouse, ya listening? You know me, I don't come nowhere to talk, blud. Anyway, I saw his face. He weren't even listenin' to you. You know what you started now, innit?
