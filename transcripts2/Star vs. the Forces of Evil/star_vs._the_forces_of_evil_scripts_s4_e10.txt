Your hands are still in way. Oh. My bad. You have brought me to cornball game? And front-row seats? Not just any front-row seats. You, my friend, are the personal guest of Queen Eclipsa herself. Hi! Have you seen my baby? Eclipsa, this is Buff Frog. Very nice to meet you. Sweetie! Sweetie, come back to Mommy! So... cornball!

 The greatest sport. Brings together families. Star Butterfly, what are you planning? Nothing. I'm just really excited to watch this game with you... and... maybe convince you to come back to Mewni. Why would cornball game do that? Because, Buff Frog, this isn't just any cornball game. For the first time, Mewmans and monsters will play together. You mean against each other. Oh, no, no, no, no. With each other! This is the first-ever integrated match. Monsters and Mewmans working together on the same teams! That is terrible idea! Okay, okay. okay, just hear me out. I know things were bad when you left. Like, really super, super bad. But things have changed. Thanks to Eclipsa, monsters and Mewmans are totally equal now. Just because things have changed does not mean they are better. Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but can you please just give this game a chance? For me? Hmm. All right, Star Butterfly. For you. Anyway, I cannot turn down a free cornball game. But beside all that, how did you even track me down? I am master spy and made sure we were untraceable. I have my ways. Whoa! Huh? Whoa! Ooh! Hi! I'm so excited to see my first cornball game! Katrina, did you tell Star where we were hiding? What did I say about being master spy? You cannot let anyone know what you are doing. Just like how you had no idea I was still in contact with Star on a daily basis? One day, she will surpass me. I am so proud. Welcome to the first-ever monster and Mewman cornball game. It's starting! We are so glad you could all join us today for the greatest game! Whoo-hoo! Cornball! Yeah! Ow! That's so loud! Sorry, dude. I am just so hyped! Hey, nothing wrong with that. I just wish I understood the rules. Mm, don't worry. I got you covered. Okay, so that's Selena Fortune, Mewni's number-one cob-kicker. - Mm-hmm. - Bleck Drockman, - the MCL's top stickler! - Stick, uh, what? Yeah. The Cassidy Brothers, they are - an unstoppable moat guardian combo. - Huh? That's Midfield husker Danny Doom, but that's just a nickname. Wait. And new up-and-comer Blabby FrontFaws. Oh, yeah. But those are just player names. I don't know what they actually do. Hmm. Oh! I know. I have an expanded limited collector edition of the original rules and... regulations. - It'll clear everything up. - This is big. Do you need any help? Nah, girl. I'm super good at books. Uh, you don't have to stay here either. You could go sit with Star if you want. No, that's okay. We just got done with this whole drama with the Blood Moon Ball. It's kind of a long story, but... If you came here to see some cornball, let me hear you scream! Oh, sorry, Marco. I'm kind of in, like, professional mode when I work, yeah. Uh, were you saying something? Nah, it's not important. You do your thing. I'll go grab us some snacks and, uh... skim through the rule book. Sounds good, breakup buddy. What up, sports fans? It is time to pick teams. Today's captain for the purple team is Bleck Drockman, and for the red team, Jason Sheffield. Aw, yes. This is where the magic happens. I'm so excited! - Let's not get hopes up. - Shh! Let them concentrate. And first pick for Bleck is... Blabby FrontFaws. Bleck is going for an aggressive offense with the up-and-coming rookie. So, monster picks monster. Oh, it's just the first pick. I mean, come on. Look at that guy. He's built like a tank. And Jason goes for Selena. Selena is known for preferring a low-scoring game. And Mewman pick Mewman. Yeah. And Bleck's turn. Back to Jason. Bleck again. Now Jason. Now Bleck. Back to Jason. It looks like old alliances hold strong on the field today, folks. Oh, come on! What are you doing? You guys notice anything? This is supposed to be an integrated exhibition match, but you're the super opposite of that right now. Come on! Time to mix it up, guys! It is not going to be working, Star. I don't get it. Is this part of the game? - No. - Hmm... This is gonna ruin everything. Eclipsa! What should we do? Oh. Well, perhaps we should... Popcorn. Get your popcorn. Sweetie, what did Mommy say about preying on those weaker than you? I just want to watch them play. - Hey, uh, want to see something cool? - Yeah. I just got a brand-new cornball. Want to go test it out? Yeah! Come on! This can't be that hard! You guys have so much in common! Like what, even? Uh, what about... monsters and Mewmans both love cornball. She's right. But Mewmans love cornball way more! In fact, Mewmans love cornball so much, we invented it. Hey, even if that were true, which it's not, monsters perfected cornball! Why don't you come here and say that to my face? I am not liking this vibe. They are ruining the spirit of cornball! Hey, got you a cornshake. No time for cornshakes, Marco! I got to go save cornball! Hey, uh, wait. Wh-Who's gonna announce? Oh, yeah. Uh, cover for me, okay? If you have any questions, check the manual. Right. Just check the manual. Chapter one... The first-ever cornball players were Mewman. That's a fact. Oh, yeah? Where did you read that? A Mewman history book? - Hey, you want to come too? - Come where? - To... - Wow! Really? Yeah! Follow me! Oh, come on. Guys, guys, cut it out! Magic bubble double diffusion! - What's happening? - Whatever's going on is your fault! You guys need to cool it! Would it really kill you to just give each other a chance? The only thing I'm giving this guy is a piece of my mind! Yeah. Forget cornball. Let's settle this the old-fashioned way! Fight, fight, fight, fight! - Guys... - Do not bother, Star. It was good for you to be trying, but I knew Mewni was not ready for this kind of thing. No, no, no. I know things look bad now, but we can't give up yet. Eclipsa, Show Buff Frog how much you care about monster-Mewman unity. What? Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I'm afraid I'm still looking for Meteora. I don't want her running off on her own if a brawl breaks out. Yes. This place is no longer safe for the children. It is time for me to leave. - But, Buff Frog...- - But, nothing. I refuse to put my family in danger. Katrina, Buff children, - we leave now. - 'Sup, Dad? Alexi, Anya, where are your brothers and sisters? - At the cornball game. - What? Where? Not that game. The other game. Yeah, the actually fun one. The other game? - Wow. - Whoa! Hey, over here! They're playing... cornball. Okay, okay, so-so if a kicker kicks with his left leg and scores, that's three points. But if it's raining on a Tuesday, then that's four points. I get it! It's so simple! Huh? What? Where's that coming from? The game's over here now? Aw! How did I miss this? All right, uh... And they're off! The red team's hitting the offense hard with a classic, uh, creepy crop circle formation. And the game's really starting to heat up, folks. Team red's going all in with the beanbag blitz. Team purple counters with a hula hoop hustle. Hey, they made my Jeanie third kicksmith. That's cute. They made my kid first kicksmith. He's got it! There you are. Well, all's well that ends well. Jordie, smile for Mommy. Go get 'em, Lexxy! Here come the huckster hurdles. They're clearing one, two, three. They nailed it! Got some great monster-Mewman teamwork here. Hey, your kids got moves. We've got some air time... Nope! Interception by the moat guardian! And he's tossing to his tenth baseman! This is for you David. I'll always love you! Wait. What's going on here? Oh. That's rule 23: no shout-outs to exes on the field. Oh, yeah. That makes no sense at all. - And it's the final play? - What? One more cross-field goal could mean... Katrina steals the ball! Looks like team red has it in the bag, folks. Katrina's bookin' it towards the goal! She's got a clear shot! She's going for it! It is a corn... in... the... hole! What does that mean? It means they just scored 15 points! They won! Fifteen points? What kind of rule is... You know what? I give up. - Good game. - It was so much fun. - That was awesome! - Great job! Yeah, we should do it again. Hey, your kid played a pretty amazing game. And your kid's got quite the kick... for a monster. - What did you say? - Oh, come on. You people get offended by anything! I'm not just gonna stand here while you belittle... And... we're back to this. Hey, Katrina, everything okay? Yeah. I just wish we could've won. Guess we will need rematch. But cornball is only played on Mewni. Then I guess we will have to stay. - What? - What? Thanks, Dad! Buff Frog, are you serious? I still have doubts, but this game has filled me with hope. I'm gonna go tell everyone! But the adults are still angry with each other. Our generation is garbage. But the little ones... They might turn out okay. Episode 10 b Title: "Meteora's Lesson" ---> Coo. Coo. Coo coo coo. Coo-coo! Is-Is this a bad time? Oh, Janna. You'll have to pardon me. I'm just brushing up on my pigeon for the dinner party tonight with the rich pigeons. Thank you for offering to babysit. Hey, anything for the Queen of Darkness. I would've asked M-A-R-C-O, but I get the sense she doesn't like him very much. Yeah, who can blame her? Marco! Exactly. Ooh. She really does take after her father, doesn't she? You be good, my darling. I'll be back by 8:00. If you're not, I charge double for overtime. Well, let the babysitting begin. - Psst! Meteora. - Hmm? Down here. Hello, Princess. Oh, geez. You would not believe the day I've had today. Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah. My arm. Just a little boo-boo. Nothing to really worry about. Oh, no, no, no. Don't cry. Your buddy Glossaryck's okay. Look. Look. I've got another arm. Plus I've got a silly hat. Now, as your guide to all magical matters, are you ready to continue our lessons? Have you been practicing the "dip down" exercises I taught you? Dee-daa! No, no. A little longer and a little louder. Di-i-i-i-i-i... No, no, no. That-That's all wrong. It's just "dip down." Two short words. Di-i-i-i-i-i... No. Now-Now you're just getting louder. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. I know how much joy this brings you. Let's get going. Wait. Wait! Don't go in there without me. Oh! Triple burger bonus! Yes! Welcome... to the Plains of Time. To complete your lesson, we got to go back in time. And we need Father Time for that. Oh, yes. Yes, yes. I can go back in time. But I can't take a passenger with me. That's why we need Father Time. Where is he? Yes, of course I knew he wasn't going to be here. If he was here, it would've been easy, and you wouldn't learn anything. Um, sure, there's another way to time travel. I just, uh... I really don't want to see Reynaldo today. Reynaldo the Baldpate, ferryman of the River of Time. Uh... Okay. Let's just get it over with. Look, look, he's gonna talk and stuff. Uh, just... don't interact, okay? All right, Meteora, pull up a seat. This might take a while. Sometimes... You know what? Never mind! He's here! For passage through my timely sea, this question you must answer me. Who speaks in rhyme and wanders time with none to call his family? No phone calls, cards or... Thank you, Reynaldo. Please be quiet. Just, we're in a hurry, and we need to get going. What doth bring you to my land? A passage through time, swift and grand? Up-bup-bup-bup! We don't have time for riddles today. Princess Meteora and I need to go back. An inch, a pinch, the years unravel. How far dost thou wish to travel? The length of something short and flat, - or perhaps something... - We just need to go... to the Age of Butterflies. With haste we must depart this place and skim the flow of time and space. Away we go and briskly float. We ride, us three, upon a... Boat. And boom goes the dynamite. At this point, I don't even know what you're getting out of this. What's dank and musky like a foot and falls apart when overcooked? In soups and stews this foulness lingers. If you must touch, don't smell your fingers. Meteora, I really must apologize. Father Time's wheel would've been so much faster and less... Reynaldo. But why don't you practice your "dip-down" while we're waiting? Dee-daa! Dee-daa! Dee-daa! Okay, that's good. But try it with more emotion. A-All right. You're getting closer. I can fill a room or just one heart. I cannot be shared, only apart. - What am I? - Loneliness. Ah. You want to get back on the Magical High Commission. I don't think so, Reynaldo. The riddle thing, it's... Look. Just because I created the commission doesn't mean they listen to me. You have arrived at the time you seek. Okay, great. Thank you! Come on. Let's go, Meteora. Bye... Dad. Oh, my goodness. They keep you well fed, don't they. All right. Are you ready for your lesson? 'Cause we're he... Oh, no. - Waa! Waa! - Waa! Waa! Waa! Waa! Wh-Where are we? Who are we? Reynaldo brought us back too far. Let's go, Meteora. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Do you... Do you know who we are? Uh... yes. Can you help us? Fine. Let's just do the abbreviated version here. A long time ago arrived the first settlers of Mewni. That's you. - Wow! - Whoa! A modest people with noble pursuits... Life, liberty and... corn. The end. Oh. One more thing. Mind if I borrow your rattle? Eenie, meenie, Mewni, moe. Okay, you, Moe. Here you go. Uh... Ooh! Congratulations! - You can do magic with that thing. - Okay. Come on, Meteora. We've got to hitch another ride with my weird son. Oh, and another one more thing. There's a storm coming, so y'all might want to huddle around that stump. Through darkness, slumbers, toils, solemnly alone, no game of catch, no father, no home. - Hey, Reynaldo? - Father! Yeah. Can we just go forward in time a bit? Thanks. Thou makest haste like wind, we shall arrive and... Oh, geez, just go. Just go. Here's a free extra lesson for you... Don't have children. Oh, looks like we're here. Boss, is this really necessary? Rasticore, if you're too weak for this, you'll never survive against a Mewman. Do it. Oh. It's kinda tingly. Great. On to the last part of your lesson. Now, they may have magic, but we are invincible. - Hey, Toffee! - Who said that? Oh. Hello again. Sorry for interrupting your weird meeting, but I'm trying to teach this little girl a lesson. What are you trying to teach her? How to get your arm broken? Yep, that's the bad boy who broke my arm. Whoa. Hold your horses. I'm sure Toffee had a good reason for doing what he did. You were making that stupid leaf hat, so I snapped your arm. Okay. Not the best reason. But that doesn't mean he has to keep doing terrible things. If he did, he'd... break my other arm. Oh, that's a good idea. Maybe that baby isn't the one who needs to be taught a lesson. Maybe we came to teach you. Well, what are you going to teach me? Okay. That's enough, Meteora. Meteora! See? This is the threat of magic. This is what we're at war against. I guess you learned two lessons today... How to "dip down," and that jerks like him never learn. Not again! Ugh. Now I got to restart from the pickle factory. Oh, hey. How did it go? Any trouble? Yeah, I keep getting stuck on this one jump on level 43. - Oh, come on! - Dee-daa! Did she just say "Daddy"? Did you just say "Daddy"? Oh, my darling! Oh, what a genius! You know, I think magic's in pretty good hands. ♪ End Theme song plays... ---> ♪ She's a princess ♪ ♪ Winning battles through the break of dawn ♪ ♪ Don't worry when it's night ♪ ♪ 'Cause she will keep the lights on ♪ ♪ Oh, there goes a shining star ♪ ♪ Evil won't deter her ♪ ♪ 'Cause magic flows through her ♪ ♪ She's a shining star ♪ Synchronized by srjanapala
