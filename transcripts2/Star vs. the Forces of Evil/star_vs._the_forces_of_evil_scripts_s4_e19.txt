 What? But there hasn't been one for hundreds of years, except for Mina. Well, that must be Mina, and she must have found some of the ancient armor. We might be able to stop her together. - Oh! - Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa whoa! No, you rest, we'll take care of Mina. Let me introduce you to the greatest warriors in all of Mewni. Roll cal! It's your girl, Kelly! We got Jorby here! I'm ready for a fight! Talon! Got your backup right here. Quirky guy. I'm just here to get hurt! Rich Pigeon. My queen, it is an honor to serve... No! No no no! Seahorse! Here, Ponyhead! Guys, this is supposed to be the biiig fight! Okay? So let's see some hype! This is gonna be the greatest episode of The Ponyhead Show ever! These are the greatest warriors in Mewni? Well, they're the greatest friends in all of Mewni, and they fight good. Star, I don't mean to insult you or your friends, but she's much too strong. She almost killed me. Look, I fought Mina before, and I held my own. Now come on, team! For Mewni! And The Ponyhead Show, okay? - Aah! Aah! Ponyhead? - Stop lagging, Seahorse! Unh! Be careful. Okay, Mina, where are you? Unh! Ugh! Oh, no. Sir?! Are you okay?! Additionally, have you seen the giant suit of armor stomping around? What the...? Star! Let's split up! We'll find her faster that way. Ooh, no, I don't think - we should... - Let's go Team Kelly! - Whoo-hoo! W-w-wait! Guys! Let's stay together! Okay, B-squad, let's patch up the civilian and resume the hunt! Ohh! Bonus medical drama! Whoo-hoo! Huh! Huh! Yah! Uhhh! Clear! Huh! Huh! Parkour, man! - Double time now! - Hut! Huh! Hoo! Hah! Ho, ho, ohhh! Hoo! Oh, yeah. Now, that's some good pain! Aaah! - Quirky! - Quirky! This is pain like I never felt before. His wounds are expanding! I've never seen a wound like that before. What is it? It's from the age of Solaria, a Mewni queen who wanted to destroy all Monsters. She created an army of powerful warriors enchanted with the queen's magic. The magic made the soldiers unstable to the point where they destroyed themselves. All except Mina. Ah, so Solaria was a crazy lady who made crazy people. She was also my mother. Oh. Lucky. Ah, here it is. "The Solarian Sword marks its foe with a scar of magic, which consumes its enemy until..." Ooh, that does not look good. Uh! We need to stop that warrior! Mina! Mina girl! I wanna make you a starrrr! It's mind games, honey! It's psychological warfare! Ohh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Seahorse! Get the shot! Look at this! Uh! Hey! Ohh, man. Aah, Talon! Don't worry, comrade! Rich Pigeon is he... Aah! Mina! Aaaaah! - Whaa! - Ohhhh! Hey, Mina! Baby, I got this! Charge! Royal advisers, if Star's plan doesn't work, we need to have another option. Well, on Earth, if people get stuck on what to do about something, they blow it up. Typical Earth attitude. Well, what's your bright idea, buckethead? Oh! Sir Dashing? Fetch the explosives. Let's blow stuff up! Aah! Whoa! Unh! Now this is quality television, am I right? Aah! Oh! Ponyhead! Looks like the series finale. Not! Oh, never mind! Aaah! Baby girl? Don't let that monster win! She is filled with hate. But you... you need to look around you! You are surrounded by love! You've got a big heart, girl! You got the biggest heart that Mewni has ever seen! Show her your heart! Unh! Yaah! Rainbow Kaiju Battle Armor! Yaah! Girl! You're so beautiful! All right, friends, get back to the castle. Mama's gonna end this. Ah ha ha ha! You hear that, Mina? Our girl's cocky! So, do you think this plan is going to work? Blowing stuff up always works in movies. You'd better hope it works, because we packed every ounce of explosive material that we have into this wagon. If this plan fails, then that's all she wrote. - Aah! - Aah! Mina! You need to stop this! You need! To! Stop! Ugh! Mewni has changed. And it's not changing ba-a-a-ck! It's over! Star, look out! Aaaah! Aah! Aaaah! Oof! Ohh! Oh, no! I call the spell which has no name. My mother's gift with which she reigned. Eclipse my heart with rightful power. Stand before the Queen and cower! Unh! Are you... Are you okay, Star? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Oh, good! 'Cause I need to sit down. Hoo! I swore I'd never use any of my mother's spells for fear of turning into her. And yet, here I am. Ha! Star! - What? - Star! Marco! Star, listen... Shh! Shh shh shh shh shh! Shut up, shut up, shut up. Let me listen to your heartbeat... ...for just one minute. Oh, okay. Oh, I am gonna keep you in my pocket from now on. - What?! - Nothing. Okay, I can tell by your heart rate that you have bad news, so lay it on me. Mina Loveberry is coming to attack Eclipsa. Dude, you're a little late. Eclipsa just defeated her with a big ol' spell. Huzzah! Uh... that's not Mina. - What?! - I'm sorry. Pardon me? I don't know who that is, but Mina is heading here right now, and she's not alone. Ha ha ha ha ha! Wah ha ha ha! There are... hundreds of them! Ohh! Episode: "Here to Help"... >> Thanks again, Mr. Slime, for the slime meringue pie. It was perfect. Not too much meringue. Glad you could come by, Princess Spiderbite. Sorry about the, uh, invasion. - Whaa...?! - Huh?! Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hold up! What happened to Doug-Doug? Doug-Doug looks pretty gone-gone if you ask me. Oh, no. No, no, no. Go check his helmet! Well, boys, it looks like Eclipsa wants to get weird. I can get weird, too! Archibald, close the gate! - Yes, milady! - Where's Meteora? Hello! Guess what! You're outta options, Princess! Mina! I'm givin' you till the crow of this cockerel to surrender Eclipsa and her husband. And don't even think about trying anymore of that magic blasty funny business like you did to Doug-Doug. Mina! Get back here and fight! I'm gonna knock the cheese right off your cracker, you... You no-good helicopter head! Star. I appreciate your fighting spirit, but I don't know if I have the energy to do that spell again. Yeah, that's right! You're not doing that spell again! That thing was insane! I mean, kudos on taking out that Solarian Warrior, but you decimated everything around it. So is that rooster gonna crow at sunrise or something? What? No! It's a dumb bird, Marco. It crows whenever it wants. And when it does, we'll have to be ready for Mina. Beh! Beh! Here, sweetie. Here's your Beh. Beh! Whoa! Unh! - Aah! - Star? Mom! You came! Oof! Did you see them, Mom? Those soldiers are everywhere! We defeated one of them, but it took everything we had! I'm here to help. Oh, dear. Okay, well, this can be treated. We need to figure out how to get the glow-wounded to the magic sanctuary. Globgor old boy! I heard you were up here! Thought you could use a good old Dad hang. Is my family okay? They're fine, yes. Moon-Pie has everything well in hand. Uh, she always knows what's right. You know what you need? Some meat. Yes! Fix you up right as rain! Ha ha ha! All right, everyone. So, yes, we threw everything we had at the first Solarian Warrior, and now there are maybe a hundred more. We need ideas. Oh, Eclipsa, why don't you do that sweet thing again? Y'know, that... With your wand thing? - You know, that... - She's not doing that again. That was too dangerous. Uh, I thought it was rad. My ancestors fought the Solarian Warriors. Now is my turn. Whoa, they fought those things?! How'd they do? Uh, bad. Very bad. Everyone die. Total shame. Ah! River! Where are you going? I'm going to get that man some meat! He is a king for corn's sake! He's a vegetarian! Fine! I'll get him some chicken! Moon, can I have a quick word? Oh, come on, you stupid thing! Rrr! Oh, come on! Eclipsa, how about I hold the baby while you do that? No, it's fine, thanks. What did you want to talk about? Ugh! It looks even more stuck now. How did it get more stuck? Oh, sorry. Okay... As you heard, I used a spell on that first warrior. It was... It was quite destructive. I saw the damage. It's a good thing no one was harmed. - No one except that Warrior!- I may have miscalculated a bit. I think I can give it another go. This time, I'll be more focused. I figure all I really need to do is take out Mina. That show of force may be enough to make an impression on the other warriors. Thank you, sweetie! Fancy a Snookers? Thank you, no. Look, if you think using that spell again is a good idea... Sorry. I'm a nervous eater. I'm open to suggestions. Well, I'm not the queen, but if I were, I'd start by getting the people to safety, then deal with Mina. Oh, right! Good idea! All right, everyone! We have a plan. We need to get the people of Monstertown to safety. Buffrog, prepare the glow-wounded for travel to the magic sanctuary. Sir Dashing, make sure we have enough provisions for all the evacuees. Just gonna weigh in one more time on doing that thing again. I'll get the provisions ready. How can we help? Marco and I are gonna take care of the pig goats! Pig goats?! Pig goats! - Come on, Marco, let's go. - Whoa! Thank you for your guidance, Moon. Of course. Maybe once everyone's ready, we can sneak out through the canals. Or, I mean, I know Star wasn't a fan, but maybe I can use my annihilation spell again once everybody's safe. What are you doing?! The warriors are out there! You and Globgor should surrender. What?! Moon, what do you mean? Surrender now, and this is all over. So what are we doing exactly? See, here's the thing. Pig goats are really dumb. They won't run from danger, so we gotta put them out to pasture so they don't end up trapped in here. Right, uh, I guess what I mean is this seems a little random. Shouldn't we help out with the evacuation? Yeah, we probably should. It's just I'm so overwhelmed, Marco. My friends came to help the kingdom, and then they got wounded, and it's all my fault. Yeah, but your mom said the magic sanctuary will fix 'em. Yeah, I know what she said. It's just this has been a lot to deal with. I know. I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm a bad person, right? My friends are wounded, and I'm basically hiding. Hiii-yah! Marco, what was that for? You're not the only one who can kick in doors. Come on. Let's decompress. Show me how to get these pig goats to safety. Okay, so you know that feeling when something is so adorable, you just need to smooooosh it? - No. - So what you do is you just harness all that pent-up love and use it to give 'em a whack! Easy-peasy taco-breezy! Okay, yeah, I'm not doing that. It doesn't hurt them. It's not that. I don't like they're eyes. Oh, Marco. Y'know... I'm glad we're alone together, 'cause there's something I want to talk to you about. I remember what you said to me in the magic. Uhh... Okay, well, you're gonna have to remind me what I said unless it's really weird, and then maybe I don't wanna know. Oh, no, I... I said something weird, didn't I? Uh... uh... Look, that place was like... It was like a dream! Those were fragments of my subconscious mind! I don't wanna know! Marco, you told me you loved me. Ah. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Maybe it was just a fragment of your subconscious mind, but... No, it's... It's not a fragment of anything. That's the whole Marco. Y'know, the whole Blood Moon curse. That ordeal? Well, it's... it's baloney. I've felt like this since the beginning. I mean, I'm not a little boy. I know that you don't just fall in love at first sight. The way I feel has just gotten more intense since we first met. And it was intense at the start, and I know it's in the way. In the way? Marco, why does it have to be bad? It is bad if you don't want it. Okay, can we kiss? Uh... please. Marco, I want you to love me, because I love you. I think we have an audience. The eyes! Maybe we ought to get back to the others. Yeah, you're probably right. Ha-yaah! Well done, Mr. Diaz. No, I can. I really can. What the...? What's going on? Do you want to tell your daughter what you did, or should I? Mom, what did you do? First of all, this did not go down the way I intended. Uh, I... What do you mean "intended"?! Are you... Are you working for Mina?! No. Mina's working for me.
