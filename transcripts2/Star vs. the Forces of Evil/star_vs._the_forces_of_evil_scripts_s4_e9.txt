 Ludo?! Miss me, Princess? Hand over the wand! W-w-what wand? Uh, I think you meant to say "bell." Bell! Did I say wand? I meant to say bell! I'm never handing over my magic bell, not over Shmarmo's dead body! Ay! What the heck, Quasar. My hero. All right, Flying Fish, fly me over to that wand... Uh, uh, Bell! Bell, I said bell! No, Ludo. You definitely said wand, and this is a bell. All right! All right! Just fly me over there this instant! What's going on? Aaah! Oomph! Wait. Well, hello there. I think you meant "goodbye"! Good one, Quasar! Oh! No, wait! Please! Please have mercy on me! I would have mercy on you! - Elevato! - Aaaah! Aaaah! Well, I've done it again. After all of the work I've done on myself, I'm back to the same old pattern of coveting magical objects, but never getting them! Whaaah! Aah-ohh! Ohh! What am I doing with my life? Is that wand the only thing that I care for? Ludo! Dennis?! Dennis! Oh, how I've missed you, my brother! And look who else is here! Spider! Oh, it's so good to see you! And, uh, whoever this is. What are you all doing here? We came to surprise you, but you weren't around. What were you doing? Oh, it doesn't matter, because I am done with all of that now. The important thing is that you're here, and I'm surprised. Well, there's actually more to the surprise. Oh, this is so exciting! Ooh! I'm gonna peek! I'm gonna peek! No, no, I shouldn't. Oh, Dennis, can I take off the blindfold, please? You're the one who put it on. Ooh! I just can't wait anymore! Surprise! C-C-Castle Avarius. I moved out of Mom and Dad's, spent my entire savings, and bought our home back. I even got the deed! Dennis, I'm going to leave now. What's wrong? I've been trying to move away from my past, and that castle is the worst reminder of it! Spider, let's get out of here. Unh! I know there's a lot of bad memories here, but I wanna make new ones. And I wanna make them with you. Fine. For you. Great! Now let's rebuild our home! Oh, whoa, what was in here? We didn't have a proper name for it, but this was my scheming room. I first schemed up my plan for stealing the wand here. That was an exciting day. Ludo! What was over here? Oh, this was my bedroom. This is where I'd have beautiful dreams about getting that wand. But, no, no! That's a long time ago. Hey, I found it! You're gonna love this. Ta-da! Ah... wha...? It's your throne! Huh? Technically, it's a swivel chair. Well, go ahead. Have a seat. Oh, no, thank you. C'mon, Ludo. I'd better not. It's super comfortable. Can I just say no and you be okay with that? But I put this back together, just for you. Well, I suppose one quick sit-down wouldn't hurt. All right, well, I'll just, uh, rest my little tushy on this cushie. Ooh, it's comfy! Ahh! So, what d'ya think. This feels better than I'd like it to. All right, our workers should be here any minute. W-Workers? Right here, boss! Oh, no. I hired some of the local monsters to help you out. Consider them your henchmen. Yeah, just like old times, boss! All right, I'm gonna go run to the Corn Mart and get some tools. Don't rebuild the whole place without me. Hey, boss, this is pretty weird, right? All of us together. Ha ha! Just shut up and put that thing in the corner! Yep, that's the boss I know. Ooh, perfect. Boss! Look what I found! Ungh! Your mini portal maker. Remember when we tried stealing the wand with this thing? No, I-I don't remember any wand! Ha ha. C'mon, boss, you can't forget the wand! Yeah! Isn't that why we're back here? So we can take the wand from Eclipsa? E-Eclipsa has the wand? I thought she was dead. Y'know, I bet the boss is gonna make Eclipsa fall in love with him and earn the wand through marriage. He's single, she's single. It's obvi. A wedding! A wedding! That's not what I'd do. No. Boss is gonna break into the monster temple and take the wand by force. The wand is in the monster temple? I know that place like the back of my hand. I'm tellin' you, we're taking it by force. No, he's gonna steal it by marriage! Betrothal! Yeah, that's how the boss is gonna steal the wand! Aaah! No, you idiots! That's not how I'd do it! I'd sacrifice all of you as a diversion, and while the guards are busy with you, I'd sneak up to her room, incapacitate her while she's still asleep, and then I'd take what's always been mine! The wand! Ludo?! I only left for five minutes, and you're scheming behind my back. Well, what did you expect?! I've been trying to change, but, oh, we had to rebuild the castle! Well, you know what? I hate this castle! It's not the castle. It's you! I think you should leave, Ludo. Dennis... Pardon me. Sorry for interrupting this tender moment. But I think y'all should leave. Who is that man? Um, he's the Land Baron who sold me the castle. But I don't know what he's talking about. Heh heh! Well, I might not have been clear. You recognize this here contract ya signed? Maybe you could tell me what this here line says? Well, I can't quite make it out without my glasses. Now, that's funny. On account that you weren't wearing glasses when you signed this. Dennis, why weren't you wearing your glasses when you signed this very important contract? They don't look cool. How 'bout you take a stab at this, li'l fella? Mmm... "I, the undersigned, do hereby surrender all of my money and promise to rebuild the property to its former specifications, and upon completion of said construction, do agree to surrender, in perpetuity, all right of ownership over said property to the previous lienholder, one Evil J. Land Baron III. Signed, Dennis Avarius." Dennis, you just signed away our entire family fortune and our ancestral home to this... rat! I didn't know. I guess I just never expected to be double-crossed. I just like to hope for the best in people. Ha ha! Well, lemme know how that works out for ya! Ha ha! "The best in people!" Ho ho! Hoo-whee! He's right. I try to live an honest life, but I guess this is just a dishonest world. Dennis, I'm trying to change! Well, maybe you don't need to change. Go ahead, keep scheming, steal the wand. I can see it's the only thing in the world you care about! So what do we do now, boss? I'm going to take back what's mine. You're probably wondering who I am. So Let me introduce myself. I have waged a war on the Butterfly family for years. I burned the magic book of spells to ashes, I fused with the most powerful relic in existence, I amassed an army large enough to conquer this wretched land. I'm Ludo Avarius! And you have my wand! What are you talkin' about? I don't have no wand! Oh, sorry, I want the deed to our castle. Whoopsies. Y'all are crazy! No, I just love my brother, but I'll do crazy things to protect him. Boop. Ah! Ah! Where am I? Take off your blindfold. Surprise! Wait. Yudo? Dudo? Cudo? Mudo? Tudo? Fludo? Zudo? Even Menudo? But the Baron? The deed? Let's say his heart is in a better place now. Think fast! This isn't Mom and Dad's castle anymore. It's ours, isn't it? - Yahoo! - I did it! We did it! Sync corrections by srjanapala
