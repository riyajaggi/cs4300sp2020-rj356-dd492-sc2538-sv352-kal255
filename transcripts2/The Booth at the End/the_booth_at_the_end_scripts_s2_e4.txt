 I was just thinking of, you know, a man when I said I wanted love. It's the moment where you go from startled to pain. That's the mark. This lady is missing. Her husband was on TV last night, talking about it. No one knows where she is. We went to her home, her address was on the internet. We wanted to make sure she was still missing. - We rang the front door bell. - And her dad answered. And he just stood there like he couldn't see us. We told him that we're sorry about his wife and that we wanted to help him. But he left the door open, so we followed him in. And there was a little girl. She was kind of a mess. She's retarded.

 What? - Just leave it alone. - It's a freak, it's not that big of a deal. I made flyers. If people see this and it helps bring the lady back home. That counts, right? I don't see why not. I want to make this as public a place as possible. Street. I need to make it public. That's lots of people to kill. - Twenty two. - Twenty-two people... - Plus witnesses. I'm gonna need witnesses. - Yeah. So... When you think you'll be ready? This is... It's gonna work, right? It will work. - I hope it hurts. - It could. Can I be a little more specific in that? But... you'll start again, you want? New Task... No, I'm already started, so... If they're gone... They're gone. Alright then. If I die... - If I die... - Before you kill the Twenty-two. No, no. After, I mean. If I'm shootin' up the street, If I'm walking down the street shooting, then some... - Of course... - I mean, there's a chance. Yeah, of course. Course. - Someone... - Yeah, obviously. But if you kill, or mortally wounded the 22 people... When the 22nd dies what you want will come to pass. I really have to plan this out then. Plan it right. You know... Move quick. Fire fast. You seem quite taken with this journey. If you could save your nation... If you could save the world..., I mean. Cleanse the world of these people. You've... You've given me a gift. I was dead. I was there. In my skin... The memory... of being in that box. And around the box... cold dirt. I think that's imagination. Dying. Decaying. Becoming part of the soil. Forming. Crawling up. What Melody? Sunlight. What could you mean? Flowers. A bit of life. Rising up to the light. Sounds like something. So, I went to her funeral. Open casket at her funeral home, and the viewing. Then I see a boy. A teenage boy. The son of a woman who had died. She looked so peaceful in the casket. All the worries of the world gone. But her son was a mess. A wild mess. An angry young man. He stood up at one side of the casket. And people could go up and see the body. But he was always there. ???? He was staring at her... - Sounds like a challenge. - I know. But like you said, I couldn't grab someone who was already crying, so... You can always pay respects to the dead. And as I did so, I was facing the son. His eyes burned right in to me. Like he knew I was up to something. He said: "You don't know her." "You never knew her." And I decided he's sorrow, he could see something. And I said: "No, I don't know her." "But when I saw her funeral taking place, I decided to come inside." "My father just died. "And my sister is killing herself." "And my mother is in grave." And... He just stood there. Just staring at me. And he began to cry. I do not know why he couldn't cry with the others, but he could with me. He cried into my shoulder for a long time. So that's one. Have you started? Yes, as a matter of fact I have. And which of your clients are you helping? Cheryl. - Which one is Cheryl? - She has a damaged child. Just leave her family for three weeks time. Doesn't seem that hard, compared to the others. That's what she thought. Is it bad for her? It's only been a couple of days. - And? - She's miserable. - You've seen her? - Yes. She's living in an abandoned building. Upstairs from her lives a friendly woman that guards the place like a gargoyle. - And what are you doing? - I brought her food. Really? What does she talk about, does she talk when you visit? Talk... Well... She... She carries on. She is almost frantic. Worried about them. Worrying about her. Did you say anything? No, I did talk. Trying to get her loosen. And did your words help? Who knows what words can do? We found a lady. A sad, homeless lady. - Living in the doorway of some empty building. - Did you know. She was just sitting there. Staring at nothing. We were passing by. Bobby and me, putting up flyers. And we talked to her. But she didn't talk back. She just kept staring at the ground. - Bobby said she was crazy. - Was she? I just kept thinking. Was she somebody's mother, or what? You know... I suppose. I miss my dad. Why? He is my dad. What was your father like? I'm not here to talk about me. Did he love you? Yes, in his way. That's nice. I'm gonna go visit the lady again. - The one at the doorway? - Yes. Why? She seems lonely, that's all. Bobby gonna go with you? I don't think so. Thanks for the soda. There's this guy, who's been helping me with my garden. He works at the place I went to buy the seeds. He knows lots of things. He reads a lot. He is sad, though. Knowledge only goes so far. He's sweet. Do you still want what you want? Yes, I can't stop thinking about her. That girl. What about you? - Why are you here? - I don't know. You won't tell me. I have a sense of it... How it will happen. The massacre? No, after that. How these people will go away. Their faith. Yeah, I'm interested in hearing about that. The whole world up in flames. Once I do this thing. I do not know how or why, but it's a clear picture in my head. It will start with my gunshots. Then across the globe, more gunshots. Simple at first. No one will think anything of it. Not the way these things go. Then it will turn into something else. Something we've never seen before. Really? You know what I'm talking about. I do. We'll keep it our secret. You're a messenger from God. You give me a chance to do something great. What else could you be? Sent to lead me on a mission to save the world. Just tell me when it's time to shine for you to shine forth in all your glory. One more to go. Before love. It's tricky with my nephew. I mean, I want to just stop. But he's so full of love now. I feel like everything I've done has been worth it, because of him. But I don't want to do it anymore. Then, stop. Okay, I am almost done. - I'm almost... - Always pushing through the resistance the very end of things, that's the most difficult, isn't it. I don't like what I'm doing. I do not like how it feels, But I like what it's giving me. I'm just so tired of settling in. And what would be the opposite of settling(?)? Certainty. So, I was out for a walk. Trying to figure out what god might be. I mean if you're asking me to do this, I'm assuming it's possible. I'm assuming so as well. Although I have no idea what you mean when you use the word "God" or "him" or whatever. The thing you want me to serve. This higher power thing. So I went for a walk... During my lunch hour, and I was sitting in this park. This stretch of shops and restaurants. I'm sitting on a bench. There's trees. It's a lovely day, there's kids. I'm just watching people. Parents, fathers, son, mothers... All walking back and fourth. And this guy sits down next to me. And he's just watching people too, except he's got this edge. This intensity, this sharpness to him. Opposed to what? Me. The dullness, The torpor. The confusion I've been feeling every day for the last 15 years of my life. So he's got that grin, this guy. And he's staring at me, like... like we're on something together. "I am looking for God." I blew it out. Just like that. "So close", he says. God is right at hand. "You just have to accept", he says. "I don't know if I believe", I say. He says "Are you willing to believe?" "Are you willing to surrender?", he says. I say No. He says that's the problem. And then he would just stare at me. Up and down, stare me up. Like... Like he's trying to figure out which side I'm on. Side of what? I don't know. I feel like I'm in a spy movie. And then he's trying to figure out if I'm a double agent sent to take him down. And at that moment, I realize that this guy believes it. This guy believes. He's a believer. - A true believer. - Yeah. So I'm gonna trick myself. - Trick yourself? - Ja. I mean... That would count, right? If I find God and I decide to follow him. Whether or not there is a god. But I really believe... and act on that. That would count, right? Because who's to say: "One way or another." Indeed. This woman came into the store a few weeks ago, looking for seeds. I asked her what kind but she didn't know. She just wanted flowers. People got flowers all wrong, man. They think they're just pretty. - They are not just pretty. - No. Flowers grow from what is dead. They grow from decay. They blossom to lure. To spread pollen. To keep life going. So that death can happen. Again. I think I marked her. In what way? I don't know, I mean... It's impossible to see. Impossible to see. Like this little flower that I made her, it's just the greatest thing in the world. Flower bed, huh? I doubt that's it. Told her about my dad. I told her about what that was like, about the funeral home, my mum. I do not even know how that happend. It's like she was... making me talk about this stuff by just being patient. I told her all the things that are important to me. And I marked her. She marked me. She did. And you did. I went to go visit the lonely lady. I just sat with her a long time, so she wouldn't be lonely for a little bit. Even if she was crazy? I do not know. Crazy won't make you less lonely, maybe not? True. I looked to the window above us. I saw this something. A movement of light. So I went onto the street, and I saw a face and pulled back right away. So I ran inside and up the stairs. It was really empty. Without walls in some places. And dusty. I moved quietly. I couldn't hear anything but I kept moving. I found a lady, looking scared. Trying to hide. She was the woman. From my flyers. - You found her? - She waved. I waved back. We just kinda looked at each other for a while. She said: "Don't tell anyone I'm here." I said: "Why did you leave your little girl?" She said: "I'm trying to know how to accept her as she is." I pulled up a bucket and sat down. And finally I said, "I won't tell anyone you're here until you're ready to come back." "But if I do, you have to let me be the one to bring you back." So then you left. No, we talked for a long time. Talked about my dad.. She said people don't try to be terrible parents. They try their best. And sometimes. Their best is just terrible. We talked some more. And then I left. I just left her there. So, you didn't go tell anyone where she was? That's all you had to do to get your father to come home. She said to wait. So, I'll wait. She might not keep her end to the bargain. She said she wants to know how to be a good mother. How can I stop her from that? I wanted to tell you something. Yes, what? My mother... I found a way to cause her happiness. - Did you make four more people cry? - No. But I tried. I told her a story. A story, really. Really. I told a story about how I met a man who sits at the back corner booth of a diner. And he said I could have anything I wanted. Sounds like it might be a scary story. Not the way I told it. How did you tell it? I told a story about how I went to the zoo, to make a child cry. But he kicked me in the chin. And how I went to pinch a baby to make it cry but he smiled. How I went to break the heart of a man who loved me by saying I never wanted to see him again. And he dumped me before I got the chance. I told her a dozen tales and more and more about how I try to save the world by making people cry and I didn't succeed. And my mother laughed. And laughed. And she took my hand, and she was happy. She thinks you're the devil. That might well be. I got what I wanted. I hope you get what you're looking for, too. What makes you think I'm looking for anything? Why else would we come to this world?
