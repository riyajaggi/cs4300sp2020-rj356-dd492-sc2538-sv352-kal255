 Do you know what can happen to someone who wanna make a deal with me? No. Anything. She's 3 but she's not growing the way she's supposed to. I realize. These pictures are very important to you. Show what's wrong with her. So you have any other... actual photographs of your daughter? No, This is what's wrong. I wanted you to understand... Yes. She's ill. - I get it. - I wanted to show you what's wrong, so you can fix it.

 - I don't fix things. - You do. I wanna focus on you. I heard about that man. Cheryl, whatever it is you've heard... He walked out of jail. After that crime he committed. After he was convicted with all of those witnesses. Cheryl, you will either find a woman without family and friends and torture her or you won't. If you do, your daughter will be healed. If not, she won't. At least not by any means found in this booth. I hear the pastrami sandwich here is really good. I've heard that too. So, you're the guy, huh. Yeah, well, we'll see about that. - Who are you? - Dillon. Hello, Dillon. - Taking notes? - Research. Writing people up, huh. Just observing. That sounds hard. What do you want? I don't wanna die. Tell me more about that. Who wants to die? You have to be more specific in the phrasing of what you want. Age slowly forever? Live the same day forever? No, no, I wanna be the same, forever. I don't wanna age, I don't wanna change. I don't wanna be able to be hurt. Invulnerable? Yeah. I just... wanna be able to enjoy my life. Do you need to live forever to do that? Haven't figured it out so far. I figure I should give myself a lot of time to... sort it out, you know. - I gotta go back to work now so... - Where do you work? Stands Home Supplies... landscaping. Look, is this for real? It's real. But if you wanna get what you want, you gotta be honest with me. I told you the truth. The words are true. Honesty's a little more complicated. You're the man who can make things happen? Oh, I hear the pastrami sandwich is very good here. So they say. I am Mar?a. - Mar?a Luisa Murrieta. - Pleasure to meet you, Mar?a. Have a seat. What can I do for you? My mother... she's very unhappy. But she's unhappy for very good reasons. My father... he died recently. And my sister... she's... she's in a clinic. Mar?a, I'm not sure how much you know about what it is that I do, but many things are possible. Oh, yes, I know. That's why I came here. So, when you say you want your mother to be happy, are you saying - you want your sister... - Her addictions... to be cured. And your father? You could do such things? Many things are possible. But I don't do. You do. By completing the tasks I give you. But my father and my sister to be healthy? Yes. I don't know. I would love to have my father back. But there are things that... there are things we shouldn't wish for. People wish for all kinds of things, Mar?a. But, to change, to remake the world? No! That'd be too much. A... breaking of the world. You understand, no matter what you choose to get, you will be breaking the world. That's what we do. We take the world... and we crack it. All right then, yes. My mother. I want my mother to spend her last days filled with the love of what is in front of her. I just don't want her to lose sight of joy. Can I ask for that? You can. What do I have to do? You'll have to make five people cry. What? I don't wanna do that. It's what you must do to guarantee your mother spends the rest of her days filled with love for what is in front of her. You said I should be specific, so I've been really thinking about this. Good. So, I want to have been married to her, Katie, the whole time. My current marriage to Heather, wiped out, like it never even happened. So you wanna go back and start again. No, no, I wanna to have been married to Katie for 20 years. I wake up one morning, tomorrow, a week from now, whenever... And bam! I've been happily married to her the whole time. And the other pieces of your life? What do you want the rest of your life to look like? No, everything else just stays the same. Same job, same success, same home, same everything. I've just been happily married to Katie the whole time. But you wanna have actually lived those years with your new wife Katie. - We've been happy 20 years of marriage. - But you wanna have experienced the marriage. I told you what I want. This is where you tell me what to do, right, so I can get what I want? No, this is the part where I ask questions and you answer them. All right. Your wife, Heather. You're not fond of the marriage? No. - Why not? - I told you already. No, you told me you weren't happy. I wanted specifics. It wasn't what I expected. You were surprised. And, what did you expect? I thought I was gonna be happy. I don't think I'm making myself clear. - Look, I came here to make a deal. - This is part of the deal. I didn't know about this part. There's no sex. All right. Is that it? It's not enough? - What happened? - What happened? I don't know. Who knows why the hell these things don't work out? Why would a man wanna lose 20 years of his life, replace them, without ever having lived them? I went to a theater. In the afternoon. - There was a man... - Why him? I'm sorry? You didn't hear me? Why him? I've no idea. You chose him. He didn't look threatening. Can you describe him? Dark hair. He's balding. I suppose... with glasses. He looked... lonely. What does that look like? Lonely? - I don't know. - You used the word. The kind of person... the kind of person that nobody pays any attention to. I saw him. I'm on my way up the aisle, reach his row, sat down next to him. And I looked at his face from the light on the movie screen. We just... We just sat there. For a moment, just the two of us, you know, just for a moment. Pretending to watch a movie. Hello? Okay. I will be right there. It's about my son. He's... I'm sorry. I have to go. It's already my break so... A son? There. Go on. A house, no one home. I parked outside a couple of nights just to be sure. Where? Two miles out, the other side of town. - What did you tell your wife? - Same as always. I was going out to think. She thinks I'm wandering around, dementia. She's worried. Should she be? Yeah. I'm doing all this stuff 'cause some guy I met in a diner is telling me to? Pen? Key under the flower pot as usual. I turn the key, enter. I find something to take and leave. What's your criteria for choosing? People are letting me into their homes too easy. They're making it too easy. - Are they? - Yeah. Leave the back door open. Why not just go wherever the hell I want to? Why not indeed? Although, technically, back door wasn't open. It might as well be. So, usually I open the nearest drawer, grab something from the back that won't be missed and take off. This time? On the bureau... The pen. In plain sight. First time I was ever tempted to take something so out in the open. Someone might... actually find it missing. You went ahead and took it anyway. Yeah. Why? Like I said... anger. Anger. If people would just pay attention more, I wouldn't have to be doing this. How many more do I have to go? Five. Five? Then, we're done? Then I keep my grandchildren safe? So... someone without any friends or family. Not connected to anyone. Correct. Someone alone. That's who I'd have to torture. That's right. Oh, wait... A woman. It has to be a woman. - Why? - I don't know. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't have to. I'm really not sure how I do this. You'll sort it out. How do I even know if I'm doing it right? I think you'll know. I really don't think that I will. Cheryl, you certainly won't be the first person to find a good reason to torture someone. My baby girl can't be a reason for that. Well, there you go. Now you know. She can't even talk. You're gonna have to decide, then, aren't you? Even if I do, I don't know where to start. Just think of all the things you would never consider doing to someone. That'd pretty much get you started. What are you doing? Imagining. Imagining the things that I would never do to someone. What? No! - What? - No. Seeing it is bad enough. Who could do something like that? This is Connor, the kid I told you about. - Is it true that you can make things happen? No. So you don't make deals with kids? How old do you have to be? - There's no discussion. - But, how old? It isn't precise. How come grownups get to get what they want, but not me? Because you don't know what you're getting yourself into. I just want my dad home. The way it was. There are things I do not know. About this world. About people. About how things will turn out. But I do know this. There are consequences. When you start changing the world, you don't know when the changes are gonna stop. See? We don't wanna change the whole world. Just his dad. You think changing a man is any small thing? I don't think it's any small thing. All right. Hey, long time, no see. - Not that long. Doris Doris. Still mysterious. Are you surprised to see me? I did leave without saying goodbye. I like to move on. I bet you do. There was... this girl, who used to come see you, teenage girl. I followed her. As usual, work to do. People thought she'd died. She was so beaten by the man she was sent to take care of that people, I guess... misidentified her. Her own father even. Peculiar. And then she turned up, right as rain. Strange. Her father spoke to you. Who are you? That's a good one, coming from you. What do you want? I asked you that first, remember? Synced by Monkeymann
