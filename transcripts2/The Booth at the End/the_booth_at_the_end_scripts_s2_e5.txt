  Previously on "The Booth at the End": Which of your clients are you helping? Cheryl. Didn't really seem the type to wanna help. Would you like me to? I found a lady. She was the woman from our flyers. You found her? Here's this guy who's been helping me with my garden. I think I marked her. I realize that this guy believes. He's is a believer. I have the sense of the whole world up in flames.

 I don't like how it feels, but I like what it's giving me. I place guns all over the place, all along the street, taped under mailboxes, in the trunks of cars I'm gonna rent and park along the street. You've thought it out alright. I've gotta get it right. 22 dead. Some will run. Some will fight back. You do not plan on living through this, do you? - Don't think so. - Suicide? I just think... Some people will come to stop me. I've been warned. Really?

 There's a man hunting me, seeking me out. An instrument of the devil, come to do me harm. Will you help me with that? I don't think so. He wants to stop me, stop me from saving the world. So what are you gonna do? Continue. I wanted a few more days. It won't be easy. My bones... ain't what they used to be in my hunting days. But I don't have time. I can, I can feel him. I can feel the heat... and breathing down my neck... and breathing on my soul. I can. It's a... spiritual heat. The battle of good versus evil. Are you certain you're on the side of good? You're the one who made all this possible. You to tell me: which side are you on? I am on this side. My side. So I, uhm, I followed one of them. Which? Theresa. The details. I just... followed her when she picked up her nephew last time she was here. There is no, no deal I'm gonna talk about. Still, I'm curious. I just saw her, standing there, waiting. This big sea of kids came tumbling out of the school. Her nephew ran up to her. Still look in their faces. What did it feel like for you, seeing that? A thing... Did she finish... her task? I don't know. Do you think she should? Not really my place to think, one way or the other. But still you do. You think, one way or the other. Well, you said, "Make something." Did you mean, make some "thing"? A task is always open to interpretation. I made Dillon share a secret with me. I made myself share a secret with Dillon. I told him about my fears... about being alive... when I know others are dead. And... he said the same thing. And... something... started... growing. Fire? Fire. Are you... prepared to give that up? Just in order to die? And another girl take your place? The choice is your choice in this particular instance. Yes. It wasn't right what happened. I have... I have to fix it. Does it just happen? Can I say goodbye to my father? And Dillon? I can't. How would you like to die? Bobby? - Where's Conner? - He's at home, with his dad. - He asked me to come see you. - Why? He found the missing lady, the one with the retarded daughter. He walked her home that night, and when he went to bed, he prayed that his father would come home. He came home. He's scared to leave. He's afraid that his dad's just gonna up and leave if he turns his back. That won't happen. Other things might, but... not that. How do you do it? I didn't, Conner did. You can really make everything happen. Not me. You help other people to make things happen. So it would seem. Why you do it? You know... Most people never ask me that question. What's the answer? I'm not telling. I can come back, right? And then ask for something else? You could. Alright. You know what you're gonna ask for? I don't know. I wanna think about it. But... I'm probably gonna ask why you do this. That'd be good to know. Henry? I killed someone. That guy I told you about. What happened? I was sitting on a bench... that bench... and he was just staring at the lunchtime crowd... with that look on his face. And he stands up and he says, "I know who you are. "I know why you're here, and you're too late." You ever get that feeling like... you're part of something bigger than you can understand? Yeah, I'm familiar with that feeling. Well, this is more than a feeling... because Jack - that's his name - - Jack? - ... stands up... and starts walking out onto the street. Then I see him go under this mailbox. He pulls out this gun... As he starts unwrapping the tape, I realize what's about to happen. And I start running towards him. I start running towards an armed man. 'Cause he's pointing it at this woman, who doesn't know what's happening, no-one does, just me. We start a wrestle, he's pointing the gun at me, and I pointed it back at him, and it exploded. And his neck just... And then I walked away. I backed out of the crowd as they were moving forward, and I... I disappeared. The police found other weapons on the street. They found plans in his home, I don't know. I don't know if they're gonna put me in jail. I don't know if they're gonna make a hero out of me. I don't know what's gonna happen. We never do. I don't think I want this thing I asked for. Trading your one marriage for the other? Losing 20 years of your life? I don't know. What do you want? I wanna live. Just live? Yeah. That can happen. Thank you for helping me. Well... You fulfilled your task. What did you tell your husband? The stress of our daughter was too much to bear... that I fled... I made up a story about getting on a bus and just riding away. And his response? Well... some men might not have been so understanding. - Did you know? - No, I had no idea. I am very lucky. And... your daughter? I used to feel angry... but now I don't. I used to feel disappointed... now I don't. You accept her. Yes. But I... I thought there'd be more joy. No joy, huh? No... just acceptance. That building a life around the daughter I have, not the daughter I imagined I'd have. Is that enough? You're asking if I wanna make another deal? I'm just asking if that's enough. Yeah, you know, I... I spent three weeks, cold and alone in a deserted building with a schizophrenic woman on my frontsteps. I had a lot of time to think about what was enough. And? I don't know. But I have... And I now I have to pay attention to that. Thank you for helping me. You're very welcome. I wanna cancel my deal. Why is that? Just... I want to cancel it, okay? So, you don't want to live forever as you are? If I live forever, I'll just... carry these marks people put in me forever. The good, the bad... Now who would want that? My parents were different than those marks. Those marks were like badges of anger. This would have been me letting those go, letting them... letting them finally die, as I stay young forever. Melody died. The girl with the flowers... the girl I was telling you about. I'm sorry to hear that. She just died in her sleep, they do not even know why. I don't want... to be frozen like this. I don't wanna feel... her mark whenever be able to feel her again. I wanna cancel my deal. Theresa? The last one.... Tell me. A man... I saw him standing as I picked up my nephew from school, down the street from us. He had kind eyes... if a little lonely. Go on. I walked my nephew - my son - back to our home. - He followed me. - What was that like, being followed? Different. - And? - Intriguing. I got home. My son did his homework. - Is he still happy? - He is. I looked out the window. I saw the man, outside, standing underneath the tree. He was waiting. He's patient... I think, or.... at least, maybe he's practicing patience. Hmm. He was waiting. My son was asleep. There was a knock at the door. I answered the door. What happened? He reached out an arm... and he held me. He just... held me. He just held me for... a long time. Nothing more, and nothing less. The last man. I'm stopping. - Why? - He said, "Know that you are worth more." "Know that you are worth more." It wasn't like words I was supposed to believe. It... it was a command. Did the command work? He backed away, he moved down the stairs, and vanished into the darkness. Just his words, right here, remaining. I went inside in my... my child's room and just watched him. The moonlight on his face, just... watched him breathe and felt, felt my own breath, how... how amazing it is... to know that I have love. I have done things over these days that I am not proud of, but this man, who knows them all, said, "Know that you are worth more." Who does that? Maybe you... the next time you see someone who needs love. Maybe. So... You... tell me. You wanted to know what motivated them. You did a deed to find out. - Did you? - Did I what? - Find out what motivates them? - I did, I think. A feeling of it. Can you tell me what it is? The trap they set for themselves get them through the day. And you're in the trap now. Make me a deal. I don't think that's a good idea. Do it, or I'll call them, I'll call them all. - You won't. - I will. What do you want? I want you to love me. Synced by Monkeymann
