 IT WAS JUST NOTHING BUT PURE EVIL. Narrator: WILL ONLINE HATE... THIS IS THE MOST PERSONAL CRIME THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. SHERI, STAY THERE. Narrator:...TURN INTO MORTAL RETRIBUTION? IT WAS LIKE SATAN HIMSELF WAS LAUGHING AT YOU. ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. - ARE YOU GUYS HUNGRY? - I'M STARVING. OH, I KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT TO DIG IN. YOU GUYS READY TO EAT? YES! Narrator: CHRIS COLEMAN FIRST MET SHERI WHEN HE WAS A U.S. MARINE AND SHE WAS IN THE AIR FORCE.

 IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. SMELLS GOOD, RIGHT? SHERI TOLD ME THAT, WHEN SHE SAW HIM, SHE JUST IMMEDIATELY KNEW, "THIS IS THE GUY I WANT TO BE WITH. "I WANT TO BE WITH HIM PRETTY MUCH FOR THE REST - OF MY LIFE." - GET READY. OKAY, BOYS, THAT'S ENOUGH, HEY, HEY. Narrator: WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF MEETING CHRIS... OKAY, EVERYBODY. COME ON, NOW, LET'S HOLD HANDS. Narrator:...SHERI WAS PREGNANT WITH THEIR FIRST SON, GARETT. FOR EACH NEW MORNING WITH ITS LIGHT, FOR REST AND SHELTER... Narrator: CHRIS AND SHERI ARE DEVOUT CHRISTIANS, AND THEY RUSH TO MARRY BEFORE GARETT WAS BORN. ...FOR EVERYTHING THY GOODNESS SENDS. All: AMEN. CHRIS CALLED AND SAID, "DAD, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE GOT MARRIED." AND I SAID, "UH, WHAT?" [ CHUCKLES ] - LET'S DIG IN. - LET'S EAT! AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT SHERI GOT PREGNANT. THEY HAD, UH, MESSED AROUND TOO EARLY IN LIFE, AND SO THEY JUST WANTED TO MAKE IT RIGHT. THAT'S GOOD. MM-HMM. Narrator: IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THEY HAD A SECOND SON NAMED GAVIN. ABSOLUTELY. GAVIN WAS THE PISTOL, AND, UH, GARETT WAS MORE LAID-BACK LIKE CHRIS. [ LAUGHS ] THEY JUST HAD A REAL BUBBLY PERSONALITY. OKAY, NOT EVERYTHING. JUST GOOD LITTLE KIDS. YOU WANNA GROW BIG AND STRONG, JUST LIKE YOUR DAD, ALL RIGHT? SHERI LIVED AND BREATHED FOR THOSE BOYS, AND SHERI WAS KIND OF LIKE THE PERFECT HUMAN UNTIL YOU OVERSTEPPED WITH ONE OF HER CHILDREN. AND THEN YOU SAW THE GRIZZLY BEAR SIDE OF HER COME OUT. BUT I'M GONNA STICK AROUND AND WATCH... DADDY, WHAT ABOUT YOU? DO YOU WANT SOME? OH, ABSOLUTELY, I WOULD LOVE SOME. CHRIS WAS A VERY GOOD FATHER. THEY WERE A FAMILY TOGETHER. THEY LAUGHED TOGETHER. THEY PLAYED TOGETHER. THEY WERE JUST A GOOD FAMILY. Narrator: AFTER LEAVING THE MILITARY, THE COLEMANS MOVE TO THE SMALL TOWN OF WATERLOO, ILLINOIS. THEIR HOUSE IS IN ONE OF THE MORE UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOODS... ...THE RESULT OF A LUCRATIVE NEW JOB CHRIS LANDED. JUST MAKE SURE NOBODY GETS IN WITHOUT MY SAYING SO. Narrator: COLEMAN IS HEAD OF SECURITY FOR THE TV EVANGELIST JOYCE MEYER. OKAY, I'M HEADED OVER TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE. GET READY TO BRING JOYCE INTO THE BUILDING. SPENDING TIME WITH GOD INCREASES YOUR JOY. SPENDING TIME WITH GOD INCREASES YOUR... Narrator: MEYER IS C.E.O. OF ONE OF THE LARGEST CHRISTIAN MINISTRIES IN THE WORLD. ...IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PUTTING GOD FIRST IN THEIR TIME. DOES ANYBODY AGREE WITH ME? Narrator: BUT HER MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR INCOME AND OPULENT LIFESTYLE HAVE ANGERED HER DETRACTORS, WHO CLAIM SHE IS A GREEDY CON ARTIST PREYING ON THE FEARS OF HER FOLLOWERS. IF YOU DON'T SPEND TIME WITH GOD, NOTHING ELSE IS GONNA WORK IN YOUR LIFE. JOYCE MEYER COULD ATTRACT THE EXTREME FANATICS, AND SHE INDICATED THAT THERE WERE CRAZY PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO MEET HER AND TOUCH HER. Narrator: CHRIS SERVES AS JOYCE MEYER'S PERSONAL BODYGUARD. HE ALSO MONITORS HATE LETTERS AND E-MAILS SENT TO HER MINISTRY. THEY THREATENED HER LIFE OFTEN. COMMENTS, "I WILL FIND HER. I WILL... I WILL GET TO HER." Narrator: CHRIS IS WELL REWARDED FOR HIS WORK. HE'S PAID IN EXCESS OF $100,000 A YEAR. THE JOYCE MEYER MINISTRIES ARE BASED IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, BUT THE EVANGELIST SPENDS MUCH OF HER TIME TRAVELING THE WORLD, PREACHING. AND WHERE JOYCE GOES, CHRIS GOES, TOO. IT'S AN UNRELENTING SCHEDULE THAT KEEPS CHRIS AWAY FROM HOME FOR LONG PERIODS. THE OTHER DAY, GARETT SAID TO ME, "WHY DOES DAD KEEP LEAVING? IS IT SOMETHING THAT WE DID?" SHERI TOLD ME THAT DURING ONE YEAR WHEN CHRIS WAS WORKING FOR JOYCE, THAT HE HAD BEEN GONE 260 DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR, AND SHE WAS STRESSED OUT ABOUT IT. LOOK AT THEM. THEY MISS THEIR DAD SO MUCH. THE BOYS WOULD ALWAYS KEEP TRACK OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME CHRIS WAS GONE BECAUSE THEY HATED WHEN HE WAS GONE. AND THEY HAD THIS CALENDAR, AND THEY WOULD MARK OFF EACH DAY UNTIL HE WAS BACK FROM EACH TRIP. SO THOSE BOYS JUST WAITED BY THAT REFRIGERATOR... ...AND STARED AT THOSE DAYS UNTIL THEY WERE UP, WAITING FOR THEIR DAD TO GET BACK. THEY LIVED AND BREATHED FOR THAT DAY. THEY WORSHIPPED THE GROUND CHRIS WALKED ON. SURPRISE! DAD! [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE BACK EARLY. I MISSED YOU GUYS. Narrator: FOR SHERI, CHRIS' TIME AT HOME IS ALL TOO BRIEF... AND IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE HE HAS TO LEAVE AGAIN. HONEY, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THIS. WHERE ARE YOU GOING THIS TIME? UH, WE'RE HEADED DOWN TO FLORIDA TO TAMPA. GONE FOR LONG? UH, ABOUT A WEEK, I GUESS. JOYCE IS TALKING FOR A FEW DAYS. THE BIGGEST TENSION IN THE MARRIAGE WAS THE AMOUNT OF TIME HE WAS GONE. JUST, HONEY, I-I MISS... YOU GOT TO STOP, OKAY? I GOT TO GO. - OKAY, BUT, CHRIS... - NO, NO... SHERI WAS TIRED. SHE WAS TIRED OF DOING EVERYTHING. SHE WAS TIRED OF BEING THE MOM AND THE DAD. I THINK THAT WAS TAKING A TOLL, AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. [ CRYING ] IT'S OKAY, MOM. HE'LL BE BACK SOON. OH, I LOVE YOU. I KNOW. Narrator: IN OCTOBER 2008, CHRIS' JOB TAKES HIM TO TAMPA, FLORIDA, THE CITY WHERE SHERI WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. SHERI TAKES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MESSAGE HER BEST FRIEND FROM SCHOOL, TARA LINTZ. SHE ASKS TARA IF CHRIS CAN LOOK HER UP WHEN HE'S IN TOWN. WHEN HE'S SETTLED IN TAMPA, CHRIS GETS IN TOUCH WITH TARA. BEIN' AWAY AIN'T EASY. I REALLY MISS SHERI AND THE BOYS. TARA HAD ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDS WITH SHERI FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. MATTER OF FACT, TARA WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT INVOLVED A DAY OR TWO OF THEIR VACATION DOWN IN FLORIDA. Narrator: AFTER CHRIS' FLORIDA TRIP, HIS SCHEDULE HAS HIM HOME FOR A FEW WEEKS. BUT HOPE FOR A LITTLE QUALITY TIME WITH HIS FAMILY IS SOON SHATTERED. LATE ON A FRIDAY EVENING, CHRIS CHECKS HIS WORK E-MAIL. ONE STANDS OUT. THE SUBJECT LINE AND CONTENT MAKE FOR TERRIFYING READING. WHOEVER SENT THE THREATS INDICATED THAT CHRIS COLEMAN SHOULD STOP WORKING FOR JOYCE MEYER, AND IF HE DID NOT STOP WORKING FOR JOYCE MEYER, EITHER HE OR HIS FAMILY WOULD BE KILLED. THE NEXT DAY, MORE AGGRESSIVE E- MAILS FROM destroychris ARRIVE AT THE MINISTRY. THE PERSON KNEW CHRIS COLEMAN'S SCHEDULE, KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE TRAVELING OUT OF THE COUNTRY... [ SLAMS LAPTOP ] ...AND INDICATED THAT THIS MIGHT BE WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED. Narrator: RELUCTANTLY, CHRIS TELLS SHERI ABOUT THE THREATS. HEY. HEY, WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT IS IT, CHRIS? WE'RE GETTING THREATENING E- MAILS AT THE MINISTRY. WELL, I THOUGHT JOYCE GOT THOSE ALL THE TIME. I MEAN, WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THESE ONES? THEY MENTIONED ME AND YOU ...AND THE BOYS. WELL, WHAT DID THEY SAY? COME ON, YOU'RE SCARING ME. WHAT DID THEY SAY? THEY SAY IF THEY CAN'T GET TO JOYCE, THEY'RE GONNA COME AFTER US. Narrator: THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, CHRIS REPORTS THE E-MAILS TO LOCAL POLICE. THIS IS THE FIRST THREATENING E- MAIL YOU'VE RECEIVED? YEAH. CHRIS COLEMAN WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREATS, MORE TOWARDS HIS FAMILY, I THINK, THAN HIM. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP SO YOU CAN GIVE US SOME EXTRA PRESENCE IN THE AREA WHEN... WHEN... YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M AWAY. HE SAID HE'S NOT HOME VERY MUCH BECAUSE HE TRAVELS A LOT WITH THE MINISTRY. SO OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFERED EXTRA PATROL AROUND HIS RESIDENCE. Narrator: DESPITE THE INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE, SHERI STILL FEARS FOR THE SAFETY OF HER FAMILY. Sheri: JESS, CAN YOU COME IN HERE A MINUTE? Wade: SHERI ASKED ME TO STAY FOR THE NEXT WEEK BECAUSE CHRIS WAS OUT OF TOWN, AND SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T FEEL SAFE STAYING ALONE. ARE YOU OKAY? I'VE BEEN BETTER. Narrator: WITH CHRIS AWAY... THERE'S SOMETHING I WANNA SHOW YOU. ...SHERI DRAWS ON HER MILITARY BACKGROUND TO PROTECT HER FAMILY. THE FIRST TIME SHERI PULLED OUT A GUN TO SHOW IT TO ME, WE WERE STANDING IN HER BEDROOM. THERE'S NO WAY I'M LETTING ANYONE COME NEAR MY FAMILY. [ CLACK ] AND SHE JUST SAID, "I NEED YOU TO LOOK AT HOW I'M STANDING." AND I SAID, "OKAY." AND I WAS LOOKING AT HER. AND SHE SAID, "I NEED YOU TO LOOK HOW I'M HOLDING THE GUN," AND TOOK A STANCE LIKE SHE WAS GONNA PUT A COUPLE HOLES IN THE WALL. WITH CHRIS AWAY, I'M THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN THAT MANIAC AND MY FAMILY, AND I'VE GOT TO BE READY. AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE READY, TOO. TAKE THE GUN. SHE SAID, "THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO DO IF SOMEBODY INTRUDES ON THE HOUSE, AND I'M NOT HERE." JESS, TAKE THE GUN. NO. TAKE IT. SHE WAS VERY SERIOUS. THIS IS LIFE OR DEATH TO HER. THESE ARE HER KIDS, AND SHE NEEDED TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON WHO WAS IN THE HOUSE WITH THEM COULD PROTECT THEM. DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. SHE'S SHOWING ME, LIKE, HOW TO LOOK THROUGH THE GUN AND, LIKE, PINCH YOUR EYE IN ORDER TO DIRECT THE BULLETS, AND WE STOOD THERE LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE UNTIL SHE FELT SECURE IN THE FACT THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHOOT SOMEBODY IF THEY WALKED INTO THE HOUSE UNANNOUNCED. Narrator: SHERI'S PARANOIA WILL PROVE WELL-FOUNDED WHEN THE COLEMAN'S VIRTUAL MENACE TURNS INTO A BRUTAL REALITY. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN E- MAILS BEING SENT TO SOMEBODY VERSUS A THREAT BEING MADE AT SOMEONE'S HOME. THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. - YOU GUYS READY TO EAT? - YES! Narrator: CHRIS AND SHERI COLEMAN AND THEIR TWO BOYS, GARETT AND GAVIN, HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT HAPPY FAMILY FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS. THEN, IN NOVEMBER 2008, CHRIS RECEIVES A NUMBER OF E-MAILS VOWING TO KILL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN. I'M JUST GONNA GET THE MAIL, HON. - OKAY. - OKAY. Narrator: TWO MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH THREATS, AN UNMARKED, ANONYMOUS, HAND-DELIVERED LETTER ARRIVES IN THE COLEMANS' MAILBOX. CHRIS, CAN YOU HAND ME THE ORANGE JUICE, PLEASE? CHRIS, THE JUICE. ARE YOU LISTENING? - WHAT IS THAT? - IT'S NOTHING. [ PAPERS RUSTLE ] WELL, YOUR FACE SAYS DIFFERENT, SO WHAT DOES IT SAY? IT SAYS, "DENY YOUR GOD PUBLICLY OR ELSE. "NO MORE OPPORTUNITIES. TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY." THE PERSON WHO WROTE THAT LETTER THREATENED TO KILL HIS FAMILY WHILE THEY SLEPT. WE ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT THIS COULD BE SOMETHING WHERE SOMEBODY IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THIS. WE TOOK THREATS VERY SERIOUS. YOU COULD TELL THE TOUGH EXTERIOR OF SHERI WAS BEING A LITTLE JARRED. [ ARGUMENT IN DISTANCE ] Pastor Bridges: OVER E-MAIL, IT'S VIRAL. TO YOUR HOUSE, THAT'S PERSONAL. THEY'VE INVADED YOUR SPACE, AND I BELIEVE SHERI STARTED TO FEEL THAT. I BELIEVE SHE WAS GENUINELY AFRAID. Narrator: BUT WHEN HE RETURNED HIS TRIP, CHRIS INSTALLS SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE. CHRIS SEEN THAT THE LETTERS AND E-MAILS WERE GETTING MORE SEVERE, SO WE PUT CAMERAS AROUND HIS HOUSE, AND THEN HE WAS WANTING TO KNOW WHO WAS SNEAKING THESE LETTERS IN HIS MAILBOX. HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS PRETTY SERIOUS, OR HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. Narrator: VIDEO FROM THE CAMERAS IS SENT TO A SCREEN IN THE BASEMENT OFFICE. I SEE YOU. [ CHUCKLES ] THE FOOTAGE IS ALSO SAVED ON A DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDER. THEN, AS SUDDENLY AS THEY STARTED, THE THREATS STOP. AND, FOR THE TIME BEING, LIFE RETURNS TO NORMAL FOR THE COLEMAN FAMILY. HEY, YOU GUYS, TIME TO EAT. IN APRIL 2009, SHERI WOULD TEXT, UH, "THINGS ARE BETTER, UH, THINGS ARE GREAT WITH ME AND CHRIS." ONE PARTICULAR SAID, "UH, I'M FIGHTING FOR MY MARRIAGE, AND I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE IT WORK." OKAY, I'LL GUESS I'LL HAVE TO EAT ALL THE ICE CREAM MYSELF. [ LAUGHS ] THAT WHOLE MONTH, UH, OUR CONVERSATIONS AND TEXTS FELT LIKE OLD. IT FELT LIKE IT USED TO BE. Narrator: BUT THE CALM DOESN'T LAST. [ PAPERS RUSTLE ] WHAT IS IT, CHRIS? OH, MY GOD. NOT AGAIN. IN APRIL 2009, THE COLEMANS RECEIVED ANOTHER LETTER, AND THIS ONE SAYS, "YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN." SHERI, STAY THERE. Narrator: CHRIS SCOURS HIS SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE. A SILHOUETTE IS CAUGHT ON CAMERA. BUT THE IDENTITY OF THE SHADOWY FIGURE IS A MYSTERY. [ CLICK ] WHEN THE LETTER IN APRIL WAS SENT, THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED WAS JUST A LOT MORE INTENSE DIRECTED TOWARDS CHRIS' FAMILY. MORE OF A, "HEY, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE." Narrator: WITH THE RISK TO THE COLEMANS APPEARING TO ESCALATE, LOCAL POLICE STEP UP THEIR RESPONSE. HOW ARE YOU? ONE NEIGHBOR TAKES A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE CASE. YOUR NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE WAY THERE HAS BEEN GETTING SOME THREATENING E-MAILS... Narrator: JUSTIN BARLOW IS A DETECTIVE SERGEANT WITH THE NEARBY CITY OF COLUMBIA P.D. - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - OKAY. HAVE A GREAT DAY. I REACHED OUT TO CHRIS COLEMAN MYSELF. I CALLED HIM, UM, ON HIS CELL PHONE. HELLO? HEY, UH, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME BUTTING IN LIKE THIS, BUT I'M WITH THE COLUMBIA P.D. AND I SAID, "I KNOW YOU'RE... YOU'RE GONE QUITE A BIT. "YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, UM, IF YOUR FAMILY NEEDS ANYTHING, HERE'S MY CELL PHONE NUMBER. "A LOT OF TIMES I CAN RESPOND. "YOU KNOW, SINCE I'M RIGHT HERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD "I MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESPOND A LITTLE BIT QUICKER THAN, UH, THE GUYS AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT." WELL, THANKS. IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED. IN LIGHT OF THE THREATS THAT THE COLEMANS WERE RECEIVING AT THE TIME, WE WANTED TO BE AS PROACTIVE WITH THIS CASE THAT WE COULD. SO WE SET UP VIDEO CAMERAS FROM MY HOUSE SHOOTING THE DRIVEWAY OF THE COLEMAN RESIDENCE. Narrator: OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS, FOOTAGE FROM BARLOW'S SURVEILLANCE CAMERA SHOWS THE COLEMAN FAMILY GOING ABOUT THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. AT 5:45 ONE MAY MORNING, CHRIS HEADS OUT TO THE GYM. [ PHONE RINGING ] ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER HE LEAVES, CHRIS CALLS HOME TO MAKE SURE SHERI AND THE BOYS ARE UP IN TIME FOR SCHOOL. [ RING ] [ RING ] CHRIS: Hi, Sheri. Call me. ALARMED HIS WIFE'S NOT ANSWERING... - [ PHONE RINGING ] - CHRIS CALLS HIS NEIGHBOR, DETECTIVE JUSTIN BARLOW. [ RING, BEEP ] HELLO? Hi, it's Chris Coleman. HEY. CHRIS TOLD ME THAT HE HAD LEFT AROUND 5:30 IN THE MORNING, WENT TO THE GYM IN ST. LOUIS COUNTY TO WORK OUT, AND HE STARTED MAKING PHONE CALLS TO MAKE SURE SHERI AND THE BOYS WERE AWAKE. THERE WAS NO ANSWER. SHE AND THE BOYS SHOULD BE UP BY NOW. Barlow: BUT SHERI WASN'T ANSWERING THE PHONE, SO HE STARTED TO BECOME A LITTLE CONCERNED. SO HE ASKED ME IF I COULD GO OVER, YOU KNOW, TO CHECK ON SHERI AND THE BOYS. - SURE. - Thanks. - I'll be home as quick as I can. - OKAY. AFTER I RECEIVED THE PHONE CALL, I GRABBED THE THINGS THAT I WOULD NORMALLY WEAR... [ GUN CLACKS ] MY, UH, DEPARTMENT-ISSUED WEAPON, A SET OF HANDCUFFS, A FLASHLIGHT AND MY RADIO. AND THEN I ASKED OUR DISPATCHER TO SEND A MARKED UNIT TO HELP ME SECURE THE RESIDENCE AND... AND MAKE SURE THAT SHERI AND THE BOYS WERE OKAY. I WAS HOPING THAT I WAS GONNA KNOCK ON THE DOOR, WE'D MAKE CONTACT WITH HER, AND EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE OKAY. I KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, RANG THE DOORBELL... [ DOORBELL RINGS ] ...LOOKED INSIDE THE WINDOW. UM, DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. THE LIGHTS WERE OFF, NO MOVEMENT, NOBODY INSIDE THE HOME. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] WITHIN NO TIME, OFFICER JASON DONJON PULLED UP, SAW ME AT THE FRONT DOOR. NO ANSWER? NO. I RANG, NOTHING. I'LL CHECK THE BACK. OKAY. [ KNOCKS ON DOOR ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES ] THEN HE WENT TO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE TO SEE IF HE COULD SEE THROUGH A DOOR, A WINDOW OR MAKE CONTACT WITH ANYBODY THROUGH THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. I got something around the back here. AS SOON AS HE GOT BACK THERE, HE GOT ON THE RADIO AND SAID, "THERE'S A SCREEN. SIGNS OF FORCED ENTRY INTO THE BASEMENT." I'm gonna call for backup. AT THIS STAGE, I WAS THINKING SOMETHING'S GOING ON. I WAS STARTING TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY'S IN DANGER. [ SWITCH CLICKS ] COLUMBIA POLICE! COLUMBIA POLICE! AT THIS TIME, WE'RE SEARCHING AND... AND... AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE NO THREATS IN THE BASEMENT. Narrator: DISCONNECTED VIDEO CABLES INDICATE THE RECORDER FOR THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS HAS DISAPPEARED. [ SWITCH CLICKS ] COLUMBIA POLICE! AS WE WORKED OUR WAY FROM THE STEPS OF THE BASEMENT, I'LL... I'LL NEVER FORGET, TO THIS DAY, JUST THAT STRONG SMELL BEFORE WE EVEN OPENED THAT DOOR OF AEROSOL TYPE OF... OF SPRAY PAINT. I JUST REMEMBERED SEEING SPRAY PAINT OF... OF MESSAGES ALL OVER THE... THE WALL. IT WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE... LIKE SATAN HIMSELF WAS LAUGHING AT YOU, LAUGHING AT US. IT WAS JUST NOTHING BUT PURE EVIL. Narrator: 13 MINUTES AFTER HIS CALL TO JUSTIN BARLOW, CHRIS COLEMAN RETURNS HOME FROM THE GYM. CHRIS, JUST STAY THERE. WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS IN THE HOUSE. I SAW THAT IT WAS CHRIS COLEMAN, AND THEN RIGHT BEHIND CHRIS COLEMAN WAS OFFICER STEVE PATTON RESPONDING TO HELP US OUT. WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE ARE THEY? I TRIED TO OBVIOUSLY NOT PORTRAY TO CHRIS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING BIG GOING ON INSIDE. CHRIS DIDN'T TRY TO COME IN, DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS. HE JUST SAT OUTSIDE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE SHERI AND THE BOYS ARE. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE IS IN THE HOUSE. OKAY. LET'S GO. I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON EMOTIONALLY FOR ALL THREE OF US IS JUST, WE NEED TO GET UP THERE AND FACE WHATEVER WE'RE GONNA FACE. GOING UPSTAIRS, THERE WERE SPRAY-PAINTED MESSAGES. IT WAS, LIKE, LEADING US TO WHAT THEY WANTED US TO FIND. DETECTIVE BARLOW ENTERS THE ROOM OF THE ELDEST COLEMAN BOY, 11-YEAR-OLD GARETT. I JUST REMEMBER SEEING GARETT THERE. HE JUST LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ASLEEP. I WENT TO CHECK FOR SIGNS OF LIFE AND DIDN'T FIND ANY. THE SKIN WAS COLD TO THE TOUCH. HE, UH... HIS... HIS SKIN JUST FELT REAL... REAL STIFF, REAL... REAL THICK, IF YOU WILL. AND THERE WERE LIGATURE MARKS AROUND HIS NECK. I WAS THINKING, "IT'S JUST A NIGHTMARE." I MEAN... JUST SOMETHING THAT'S PURE EVIL. JUST... JUST SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, SEEING SOMEONE TAKE THE LIFE OF A CHILD. YOU... YOU JUST CAN'T DESCRIBE IT. Narrator: IN THE NEXT ROOM, STEVE PATTON CHECKS ON GARETT'S YOUNGER BROTHER, GAVIN. MARKS ON HIS NECK SHOW HE, TOO, HAS BEEN STRANGLED TO DEATH. THE KILLER HAS ALSO SPRAYED AN OBSCENE MESSAGE ON THE YOUNG BOY'S BED SHEETS. FINALLY POLICE ENTERED THE MASTER BEDROOM. COLUMBIA POLICE DEPARTMENT! SHERI WAS LYING ACROSS THE BED. SHE WAS NAKED. SHE HAD HER HAIR JUST DRAPED ACROSS HER FACE. HER BODY, HER LIMBS WERE JUST VERY, VERY STIFF. WE LEARN ABOUT RIGOR MORTIS, AND TO ME, IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD EITHER STARTED TO SET IN, OR IT WAS GETTING CLOSE. Narrator: TELLTALE BRUISING ON SHERI'S BODY INDICATES SHE PUT UP A FIGHT. HELLO?! WHAT'S GOING ON? Barlow: WE HEAR CHRIS COLEMAN COME IN, AND HE KIND OF ANNOUNCES HIMSELF. AND WHAT I'M THINKING IS, "HOW DO I JUST TELL THIS GUY HIS WIFE AND TWO KIDS ARE DEAD?" CHRIS... THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Barlow: SO OFFICER PATTON AND I... LET'S GO OUTSIDE. ...GO UP TO CHRIS. WE GUIDE HIM OUT OF THE... OUT OF THE HOME VERY, WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER FOR THE SITUATION, VERY... VERY GENTLY. COME ON, CHRIS. [ BREATHING UNEVENLY ] [ CRYING ] AFTER OFFICER PATTON AND I WALK CHRIS OUT OF THE HOUSE, HE SAYS HE'S GONNA THROW UP AND THEN KINDA GETS IN THE FETAL POSITION AND STARTS CRYING. [ SOBBING ] [ BREATHING UNEVENLY ] [ CRYING ] SHERI, THE BOYS... CHRIS CALLED JUST ABSOLUTELY SCREAMING, UH, "SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO SHERI AND THE BOYS. SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO SHERI AND THE BOYS." THEY WON'T LET... THEY WON'T LET ME IN. THEY WON'T LET ME IN. UH, CHRIS WAS IN SHOCK. UH, HE WAS JUST... HE WAS JUST IN SHOCK. HE WAS JUST IN ANOTHER WORLD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. HE JUST COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT TOOK PLACE. Narrator: NEWS OF THE MURDERS REVERBERATES AROUND THE SMALL COMMUNITY OF WATERLOO. Barlow: WE DECIDED TO GET CHRIS OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE, JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S COMFORTABLE AND JUST TRY TO HELP HIM IN ANY WAY WE CAN. [ CRYING ] Narrator: CHRIS COLEMAN IS TAKEN TO THE NEARBY COLUMBIA POLICE DEPARTMENT. BARLOW ASKS CHRIS IF HE CAN SHED ANY LIGHT ON THE KILLINGS. Barlow: MYSELF AND MY PARTNER STARTED THE INTERVIEW WITH, "ALL RIGHT, "LET'S JUST GET AN IDEA OF WHAT'S GOIN' ON WITH YOU, "WHAT'S GOIN' ON WITH YOUR FAMILY, WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT," JUST MORE OF A STATEMENT TYPE OF THING. [ SNIFFLING ] DURING OUR INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS, WE WANTED TO GET AS MUCH BACKGROUND INFORMATION, UM, ABOUT THE VICTIMS AS WE COULD. CHRIS TELLS US HE AND SHERI HAD A GREAT MARRIAGE, SAYS THAT THEY DID HAVE A ROUGH PATCH BACK IN, UH, 2008. AND WE START ASKING CHRIS, "HAVE YOU EVER CHEATED ON SHERI?" AND HE SAYS, "NO, I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE." AND THEN THE NAME TARA LINTZ GETS BROUGHT INTO THE... INTO THE EQUATION. COLEMAN DENIES HAVING AN AFFAIR BUT ADMITS HE'S BECOME VERY CLOSE TO TARA LINTZ, A HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND OF SHERI'S WHO HE MET UP WITH WHILE WORKING IN FLORIDA. AND THEN, WE ASKED HIM, "HAVE YOU EVER TALKED OR DONE ANYTHING WITH TARA THAT SHERI WOULDN'T APPROVE OF?" AND THEN, CHRIS STARTS TO TELL US HOW TARA AND HIM HAD TALKED ABOUT THEIR BODY PARTS. THEY'VE SENT PICTURES AND... AND VIDEOS OF EACH OTHER BACK AND FORTH, BUT THAT'S IT. Narrator: TO GET A HANDLE ON THE TRUE EXTENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP, THE POLICE CONTACT TARA LINTZ. WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS ARRIVED AND SPOKE TO TARA, SHE ADMITTED THAT HER AND CHRIS COLEMAN WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR. THEY HAD BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER SINCE NOVEMBER OF 2008, WHICH WAS VERY EERIE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE THREATS STARTED COMING IN WITH THE E-MAILS ABOUT CHRIS' FAMILY BEING MURDERED. TARA SAID SOMETHING VERY ODD. SHE ASKED IF SHE NEEDED AN ATTORNEY. AND WE JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY, REALLY WEIRD. WHY WOULD SHE ASK SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF SHE WASN'T INVOLVED IN SOME WAY? Narrator: EVENTUALLY, CHRIS ALSO ADMITS TO THE AFFAIR BUT INSISTS IT'S OVER. CHRIS TOLD ME THAT HE RECOGNIZED THAT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS ABSOLUTELY WRONG AND WAS TRYING TO BREAK AWAY FROM IT. BUT TARA REALLY WOULD NEVER REALLY LET HIM GO, JUST LET IT GO AND DROP IT. Narrator: CHRIS CLAIMS TARA REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE RELATIONSHIP HAS ENDED, AND SHE'S CONSTANTLY PUSHING HIM TO LEAVE SHERI. Heine: TARA AND CHRIS BOUGHT BLACK RINGS THAT THEY WORE WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER. THEY WERE LIKE WEDDING RINGS, AND WHEN WE WENT OUT AND SPOKE TO HER, SHE WAS WEARING THIS RING. TARA WANTED SHERI'S LIFE. SHE WANTED TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH CHRIS. Narrator: SUDDENLY, TARA LINTZ BECOMES A PERSON OF EXTREME INTEREST TO DETECTIVES. WE DEFINITELY HAD TO CHECK OUT AND FIND OUT WHERE SHE WAS DURING THAT TIME. Narrator: WHILE POLICE CHECK ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF TARA LINTZ ON THE DAY OF THE MURDERS, CHRIS COLEMAN IS RELEASED. JUST BECAUSE CHRIS HAD AN AFFAIR WITH TARA, IT DID NOT MEAN THAT HE MURDERED HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS AND WHINES ] Narrator: THE BRUTAL DEATHS OF SHERI, GARETT, AND GAVIN TRIGGER ONE OF THE BIGGEST MURDER INVESTIGATIONS IN ILLINOIS' HISTORY. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] A TASK FORCE OF 25 EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS IS IMMEDIATELY ASSIGNED TO TRACK DOWN THE KILLER. [ SIREN WAILING, POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Heine: WE WORKED 15 DAYS STRAIGHT, AND THESE WERE 18, 20-HOUR DAYS. IT WAS HUGE. UM, WE CALLED IN PROFESSIONALS FROM MANY AREAS TO HELP US WITH THIS CASE. Narrator: EARLY SUSPECT TARA LINTZ IS SOON CLEARED OF SUSPICION. WE USED INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES TO CONFIRM, YES, SHE WAS IN FLORIDA. SHE WAS NEVER IN ILLINOIS, NEVER IN THE ST. LOUIS AREA. SHE WAS WHERE SHE... SHE TOLD US SHE WAS. Narrator: THE TASK FORCE FOCUSES ITS EFFORTS ON IDENTIFYING THE SOURCE OF THE HATE-FILLED E-MAILS SENT TO CHRIS COLEMAN. EVERY HOSTILE MESSAGE RECEIVED BY THE JOYCE MEYER MINISTRIES IN THE LAST YEAR IS EXAMINED. THE THREATS THAT WE INVESTIGATED LED US TO ARIZONA, FLORIDA, UH, ALL OVER TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. EACH PERSON WHO'D E-MAILED THEIR GRIEVANCES TO MEYER IS TRACKED DOWN AND INTERVIEWED, BUT TO NO AVAIL. NOBODY THAT WE... THAT WE TALKED TO THAT SENT THESE THREATS REALLY ROSE TO OUR SUSPICION, UM, TO A LEVEL OF THEM BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMITTING THE MURDERS OF SHERI, GARETT, AND GAVIN COLEMAN. Narrator: BUT WHILE ONE DIGITAL TRAIL HITS A DEAD END, ANOTHER PROVIDES THE INVESTIGATION WITH AN UNEXPECTED BREAKTHROUGH. THE COMPUTER FORENSICS TEAM EXTRACTS THE PRECISE DATE AND TIME THE FIRST MESSAGE FROM destroychris WAS GENERATED. JUST BEFORE THE FIRST THREATENING E-MAIL WAS SENT. WE FOUND OUT THAT THAT E-MAIL WAS SENT FROM CHRIS COLEMAN'S I.P. ADDRESS. Narrator: THE ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING. THE PERSON BEHIND THE DEATH THREATS TO HIS FAMILY... [ TYPING ] ...IS CHRIS COLEMAN HIMSELF. Narrator: IN THEIR HUNT FOR THE KILLER OF SHERI, GARETT, AND GAVIN COLEMAN... [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] A MAJOR CASE SQUAD HAS IDENTIFIED CHRIS COLEMAN AS THE PERSON BEHIND THE DEATH THREATS AIMED AT HIS FAMILY. BUT BEFORE HE CAN BE CHARGED, INVESTIGATORS NEED CORROBORATING EVIDENCE. EXPERTS CHECK FOR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE SPRAY-PAINTED MESSAGES IN THE COLEMANS' HOME AND CHRIS' HANDWRITING. WE DID THAT BY TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SAMPLES THAT WERE LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE, TAKING THE KNOWN SAMPLES THAT WE GOT FROM CHRIS COLEMAN, AND WE SENT IT TO A HANDWRITING EXPERT. THE EXPERT LOOKED AT IT, COMPARED IT AND SAID IT'S A MATCH. Narrator: THE GRAFFITI PROVIDES A FURTHER CRITICAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THE PRECISE BRAND AND COLOR OF THE SPRAY PAINT AS RUST-OLEUM CANDY APPLE RED. WHEN DETECTIVE KARLA HEINE DISCOVERS EVIDENCE OF COLEMAN MAKING A RECENT PURCHASE AT A HARDWARE STORE, SHE FOLLOWS A HUNCH AND CALLS THE MANAGER. SHE SAID, "WELL, HE BOUGHT SOME SPRAY PAINT THERE." I WAS, LIKE, "YOU'RE KIDDING ME. WHAT KIND OF SPRAY PAINT?" "IT WAS RUST-OLEUM, CANDY APPLE RED." I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS. YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT CHRIS COLEMAN COULD KILL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN. YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT. BUT ALL OF THE OVERWHELMING PIECES OF EVIDENCE KEPT COMING IN, AND THEY KEPT POINTING TO HIM. Narrator: RESULTS FROM AUTOPSIES OF THE VICTIMS ONLY ADDS TO THE EVIDENCE AGAINST CHRIS. THE TIME OF DEATH BECAME A BIG FACTOR FOR US BECAUSE CHRIS TOLD US DURING THE INVESTIGATION THAT HE HAD LEFT AROUND 5:45 THAT MORNING. SO, DURING THE INVESTIGATION, WE REACHED OUT TO A PATHOLOGIST OUT IN NEW YORK, AND HE ACTUALLY CONFIRMED THAT SHERI, GARETT, AND GAVIN WERE PROBABLY KILLED AROUND 3:00 A.M. THAT MORNING, WHICH PUTS CHRISTOPHER COLEMAN IN THAT HOUSE AROUND THE TIME OF DEATH. Narrator: EXACTLY TWO WEEKS AFTER THE BODIES OF SHERI, GARETT, AND GAVIN WERE FOUND, CHRIS COLEMAN IS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. Man: MURDERER! Woman: BABY KILLER! Woman: MURDERER! Narrator: WITH SUCH OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE, COLEMAN IS HELD WITHOUT BOND. MURDERER! THIS IS THE MOST PERSONAL CRIME THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO STRANGLE SOMEBODY. IT TAKES FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES, OKAY? IT'S NOT AN INSTANT THING. SO YOU HAD TO DO THAT THREE TIMES, THREE TIMES... YOUR WIFE AND THEN YOUR OLDEST SON AND THEN YOUR YOUNGEST SON. Narrator: WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE DRIVEN COLEMAN TO SLAUGHTER HIS FAMILY? SHERI'S DISCOVERY OF HER HUSBAND'S AFFAIR WITH TARA LINTZ MAY HAVE BEEN THE CATALYST. WHEN IT CAME OUT THAT CHRIS WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR, SHERI WAS ACTUALLY THE PERSON WHO TOLD ME. HEY, JESS. YOU WANT TO COME IN HERE AND SEE THE WOMAN MY HUSBAND'S HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH? WHAT? ARE YOU SURE? OH, YEAH. I'VE SEEN THE TEXTS. I'VE HEARD THEM TALKING. SHE WAS, LIKE... [ SNIFFLES ] "HERE SHE IS." AND SHE PULLED UP FACEBOOK, TYPED IN A NAME, SPUN IT AROUND, AND SHOWED ME THIS WOMAN'S FACE. TARA LINTZ. [ TYPING ] WE USED TO BE BEST FRIENDS. [ LAUGHS ] AND THE FUNNY THING IS, I INTRODUCED HIM TO HER. [ LAUGHS ] AND THEN, IT JUST STARTED, LIKE, A... LIKE A CRACKING OF CHINA. LIKE, SHE JUST COMPLETELY CAME APART. LET'S CALL HIM RIGHT NOW AND SEE IF HE ANSWERS, RIGHT? DON'T... DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF. LET'S... LET'S CALL AND SEE IF HE ANSWERS. SHERI. BECAUSE HE'S GONNA COME HOME BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE WITH US. [ CRYING ] BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SEE HIS BOYS... AND BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE WITH ME. BUT SHERI LOVED CHRIS SO MUCH THAT SHE REALLY MEANT "TILL DEATH DO US PART." AND SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT KIND OF COMPASSION AND THAT KIND OF LOYALTY, KNOWING CHRIS WOULD HAVE DONE THIS, SHERI WOULD'VE OFFERED THAT MAN FORGIVENESS. - [ CRYING ] I LOVE HIM. - I KNOW. I CAN'T LOSE HIM, JESS. I LOVE HIM. Narrator: CHRIS REALIZED SHERI WOULD NEVER DIVORCE HIM, AND IF HIS BOSS, EVANGELIST JOYCE MEYER, HAD HEARD ABOUT HIS ADULTERY, IT COULD'VE COST HIM HIS HIGH-PAID, JET-SETTING JOB. AND HE'S ALSO HAVE RUN THE RISK OF LOSING TARA. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO YOUNG BOYS WERE KILLED IN THEIR BEDS. THAT'S THE SAFEST PLACE IN THEIR LITTLE WORLDS, IS SAFE IN THEIR BEDS. IT WAS JUST SO HEARTBREAKING. Narrator: PRECISELY TWO YEARS TO THE DAY AFTER HIS FAMILY WAS FOUND SLAIN, CHRIS COLEMAN IS FOUND GUILTY OF THREE COUNTS OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. HE'S SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE.
