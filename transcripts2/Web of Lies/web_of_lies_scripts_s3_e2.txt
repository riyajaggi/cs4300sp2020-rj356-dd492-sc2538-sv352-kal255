 WITH A PACK OF ONLINE PREDATORS... SHE'S KIND-HEARTED, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD USE HER. THERE WAS ONE GUY THAT WAS A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. I TOLD MY MOM, I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS." I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE WE GOT A LITTLE LAX. THINGS JUST SNOWBALLED FROM THERE. ANGIE ALLEN IS ONLY 15, BUT SHE'S GROWING UP FAST. ALREADY, SHE'S FANTASIZING ABOUT HAVING A REAL BOYFRIEND, HER FIRST. IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT GROWING UP IN VAN BUREN WHEN YOU'RE 14 OR 15. ANGIE WAS MY ONLY FRIEND I REALLY, YOU KNOW, CARED ABOUT.

 SHOW ME THAT PICTURE OF JOSH AGAIN. OKAY. ANGIE MET CHEYENNE A YEAR AGO. NOW THEY'RE INSEPARABLE AND SPEND HOURS LOOKING AT PHOTOS OF BOYS. I KNOW. ME AND ANGIE CLICKED RIGHT THERE. WE JUST KNEW AUTOMATICALLY WE WERE BEST FRIENDS. THINK YOUR MOM'S GONNA GET YOU A PHONE SOON? I'M WORKING ON IT. ANGIE SHOWED NOTHING BUT HAPPINESS AND JOY. I HONESTLY WISHED I COULD'VE BEEN LIKE HER. ANGIE AND HER BROTHER, SETH, LIVE IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING IN VAN BUREN, ARKANSAS. HEY, ANGE. HEY, CHEY. HOW'S IT GOING, SETH? NOT TOO BAD. WE GET ALONG PRETTY GOOD. IT'S NORMAL BROTHER-SISTER THING. LIKE, WE'LL ARGUE A LOT, BUT, I MEAN, THAT'S NORMAL. I'LL CATCH YOU LATER. BYE. HEY, SETH. TELL MOM I'LL BE IN IN A MINUTE, OKAY? SHE'S ALWAYS LOVED HER BROTHER. THEY'RE LIKE PEAS IN A POD. SHE IS A HUGE ROMANTIC. HER FAVORITE KIND OF MOVIES ARE, LIKE, PRINCE CHARMING AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST EVERYTHING FALLS TOGETHER AND HAPPY ENDING. SHE'S JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE SHE IS IN THIS WORLD AND, LIKE, WHAT SHE'S GONNA DO WITH HER LIFE. ANGIE AND SETH ARE BEING RAISED BY THEIR GRANDMOTHER, COLLEEN. COLLEEN'S POOR HEALTH HAS FORCED HER TO RELY ON GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. SHE HAS NO MONEY FOR LUXURIES LIKE A COMPUTER OR A CELLPHONE FOR EITHER CHILD. WHEN I WAS SIX MONTHS, MY DAD WALKED OUT ON ME AND MY SISTER. AND MY BIOLOGICAL MOM IS UNFIT AS A PARENT. I'VE ALWAYS GREW UP CALLING MY GRANDMA MOM. ANGELA. FAMILIES TAKE CARE OF FAMILIES. AND, YES, IT IS A... A HARD, DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE, BUT THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP YOUR FAMILIES TOGETHER, IS BY STEPPING UP AND TAKING CARE OF YOUR LOVED ONES. HEY, MOM. I'M, I'M GOING TO THE LIBRARY AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW JUST TO USE THE COMPUTER. I DID NOT WANT TO SEE ANYTHING HAPPEN TO EITHER ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN. SO THEY BECAME MY LIFE. IS THAT NICE BOY JAMIE STILL WALKING YOU TO SCHOOL? I'M NOT TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT BOYS, MOM. I WAS JUST ASKING. I TOOK ON THESE TWO, AND I THOUGHT, "MY GOSH." THERE'S A LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT I BIT OFF, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S WORTH IT. IN THE END, IT'S WORTH IT. THEY'D HAVE TIMES WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY, BUT HER GRANDMA WOULD ALWAYS PUT HER AND SETH FIRST. NO MATTER HOW THINGS WENT, SHE ALWAYS MADE SURE THEY HAD FOOD ON THE TABLE. TODAY IS ANGIE'S SWEET 16 BIRTHDAY. COLLEEN HAS SCRAPED TOGETHER ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY HER A VERY SPECIAL PRESENT. SHE WAS SO EXCITED TO TURN 16. SHE HAD THIS 16 BALLOON MADE AND EVERYTHING. IT WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL PINK. SHE GOT HER DREAM BIRTHDAY PARTY. ANGELA HAD BEEN, "MOM, I GOT A BIRTHDAY COMING UP. HEY, MOM, YOU SEE THIS? I NEED A NEW PHONE." JUST FOR YOU. HAPPY SWEET 16. STOP. I LOVE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HONEY. I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE THAT HAPPY. LIKE, SHE WAS JUST ECSTATIC. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. - THANK YOU, SETH. ANGIE HAS BEEN LONGING FOR THIS MOMENT. NOW SHE CAN BE JUST LIKE THE POPULAR GIRLS. EXCITED, SHE JOINS GAMING SITE MOCOSPACE AND FACEBOOK WITH PUBLIC ACCESS TO HER ACCOUNTS. I WASN'T REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER GETTING ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE I KNEW THAT ALL OF HER FRIENDS HAD, FACEBOOK AND, THINGS LIKE THAT, AND THAT'S HOW THEY STAYED IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER. SHE'S FALLING IN WITH THE REST OF HER FRIENDS. SHE'S CONSTANTLY TEXTING. SHE LOVED TAKING PICTURES OF HERSELF EVERY DAY, AND SHE'D POST 'EM ALL ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT OF IT AS, "I'M BEAUTIFUL, SO I'M GONNA SHOW IT." YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. - OKAY. WITH NO EXPERIENCE ON THE INTERNET, COLLEEN CAN'T TEACH ANGIE HOW TO STAY SAFE ONLINE. I DID NOT REALLY REALIZE HOW MUCH THESE PHONES COULD DO. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT AT THE TIME. BUT SETH SEES HOW QUICKLY HIS SISTER GETS OBSESSED WITH HER NEW LIFE ONLINE. IT WAS AROUND 2:00, 3:00 IN THE MORNING. I CONSTANTLY KEPT HEARING A RINGTONE COMING FROM MY SISTER'S ROOM. HE KNOWS THAT IF ANGIE'S ENTERING CHAT ROOMS, THEY ARE SOMETIMES POPULATED BY ADULTS WHO PREY ON CHILDREN. NO, WHO IS THIS? HE, TOLD ME HIS NAME WAS CHARLES. NO, WHY ARE YOU CALLING A 16-YEAR-OLD AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING? AT THE TIME, I BELIEVED HE WAS, ABOUT 30. SHE HAD BEEN TELLING HIM THAT SHE WAS 21, GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS. NO. SHE'S NOT IN COLLEGE. LIKE, THEY WERE GONNA MEET IN ABOUT A WEEK. NO, JUST DON'T CALL THIS NUMBER BACK, OKAY? WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? GIVE ME MY PHONE BACK. YO, WHO IS THIS CHARLES? AND, THAT'S WHEN I FINALLY FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS GETTING ON CHAT ROOMS. TALK TO YOU. - YOU'RE NOT MY DAD. STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO. WHEN SHE FOUND OUT THAT... WHAT I HAD DONE, SHE CAME AT ME, LIKE, FURIOUS, AND, LIKE, CUSSED ME OUT. - GET OUT. I HATE YOU. - DOING THIS FOR YOU, OKAY. COLLEEN IS AWOKEN BY THE SCREAMING ARGUMENT... WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT IT LIKE... NO, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, ANGELA. - WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE? - DON'T TELL HER. ...AND SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT THE FIGHT IS ABOUT A MAN CALLING 16-YEAR-OLD ANGELA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THE LOOK ON MY MOM'S FACE WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT THAT WAS JUST SHOCK. ARE YOU TALKING TO OLDER GUYS ONLINE? NO. JUST... IT'S... WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ANGELA? YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. ANGIE, YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS TALKING TO OLDER GUYS. MOM, LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M SERIOUS, ANGELA. YOU HAVE NO CLUE OF WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO, WHOM YOU ARE DEALING WITH. IT'S GOT TO STOP. ...BUSINESS TALKING TO OLDER GUYS. COLLEEN AND SETH FINALLY TALK SOME SENSE INTO ANGIE. SHE PROMISES NOT TO LOG IN TO ANY MORE CHAT ROOMS. SHE'S, MORE NAIVE THAN ANYTHING. SHE JUST GOES TO A SITE, YOU KNOW, EXPECTS IT TO BE OKAY, YOU KNOW, NOTHING BAD'S GONNA HAPPEN. BUT ANGIE IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT JUST HOW BAD THINGS CAN GET IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL ONLINE. ANGIE'S FRIEND, LORRAINE, HAS GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH A MIDDLE-AGED MAN FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, EARL DELMAR PIGG. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? JUST OUT FOR A DRIVE. WITH HIM? YEAH. BUT HE'S SO CREEPY. IT'LL BE FUN. HI. MR. PIGG WAS AN OLDER GENTLEMAN THAT WOULD... HE WOULD BEFRIEND TEENAGE GIRLS, BUY 'EM THINGS, TAKE 'EM PLACES, YOU KNOW, AND HE WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON GIRLS THAT WERE THE LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES. ANGIE'S UNNERVED BY LORRAINE'S CHOICE OF BOYFRIEND. SHE BEGINS TO THINK COLLEEN AND HER BROTHER ARE RIGHT. SHE SHOULD STICK TO BOYS HER OWN AGE. SOON, SHE GETS A FRIEND REQUEST FROM A BOY NAMED JOHN. HE'S 17, REALLY CUTE, AND GOES TO ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL NEARBY. ANGIE WAS BEING A NORMAL TEENAGE GIRL, LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ROMANCE. IN A MATTER OF DAYS, JOHN BECOMES ANGIE'S ONLINE BOYFRIEND. THEY CONSTANTLY TEXT EACH OTHER. GO AHEAD. I JUST GOT A TEXT. SHE DID TELL ME THAT SHE WAS INTO A GUY, AND I ASKED HER IF SHE KNEW HIM. AND SHE WAS LIKE, "YEAH." JOHN ASKS TO SEE A PICTURE OF ANGIE DRESSED UP FOR CHURCH. SHE'S HAPPY TO OBLIGE. SHE NEVER TOLD ME HIS NAME OR ANYTHING. SHE JUST SAID, "YOU KNOW, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM. I KNOW HE'S THE ONE. YOU KNOW, HE'S MY PRINCE CHARMING." AND SHE TOLD ME THAT, YOU KNOW, HE'S BASICALLY THE ONE SHE WANTS TO BE WITH FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. HE'S SO CUTE. OKAY, LET'S GO. - YEAH. - EVERYTHING GOOD? YEAH. ANGIE'S ROMANCE WITH 17-YEAR-OLD JOHN HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO WEEKS NOW. SHE HASN'T MET HIM IN PERSON YET, BUT HE'S ALWAYS WITH HER. HE MAKES HER FEEL SAFE. I'M SORRY. TONIGHT, ANGIE IS BABYSITTING FOR SOME KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BYE, ANGIE. WE WON'T BE LATE. BYE, HAVE A NICE TIME. ONCE THE PARENTS LEAVE, SHE GOES RIGHT BACK TO TEXTING WITH JOHN. AS THEY ARE TEXTING, JOHN MAKES A NEW REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL KIND OF SELFIE, A SEXY ONE. ANGIE HESITATES. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO. BUT HE IS HER BOYFRIEND. SHE CAN TRUST HIM, RIGHT? WITH HER FEELING HOW SHE WAS TOWARDS HIM, LIKE SHE WAS ACTUALLY GONNA BE WITH HIM FOREVER, "HE DON'T WANT JUST MY BODY. HE WANTS ME." SO GOTTA GIVE HIM SOMETHING THAT SHE WANTS TO SHOW HIM THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY VERY HAPPY WITH HIM. AND THAT HE CAN BE HAPPY WITH HER. ANGIE CAVES UNDER PRESSURE, UNAWARE THAT SHE'S CHANGING THE COURSE OF HER LIFE FOREVER. IT CONCERNS ME THAT MY SISTER'S NOT LISTENING TO ANYONE, AND, "I'M JUST GONNA DO MY OWN THING. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME." 16-YEAR-OLD ANGIE ALLEN'S NEW 17-YEAR-OLD ONLINE BOYFRIEND JOHN HAS PERSUADED HER TO TEXT HIM SOME TOPLESS SELFIES. NOW SHE WONDERS IF SHE HAS MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. SHE'S KIND-HEARTED AND LOVABLE TO AN EXTENT OF THE FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN USE HER IF THEY WANTED TO. BUT JOHN ISN'T SATISFIED WITH WHAT ANGIE SENT. AS SOON AS SHE GETS HOME FROM BABYSITTING, HE PUSHES HER FOR MORE. FELT LIKE I COULD TRUST HER. I FELT LIKE I HAD GOTTEN THROUGH TO HER THAT THE INTERNET WAS NOT A SAFE PLACE. COLLEEN HAS NO IDEA WHAT HER TEENAGE GRANDDAUGHTER IS DEALING WITH. SHE'S NEVER EVEN HEARD OF A SELFIE. I'VE GOT YOUR FRESH CLOTHES. JUST LEAVE IT. I'M... I'M STUDYING. WELL, I'LL JUST LEAVE 'EM HERE ON YOUR BED. NO, MOM. NO. WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT, "WELL, I'M STUDYING, MOM." OKAY, I BELIEVED HER. AND, YOU KNOW, IF A CHILD'S STUDYING, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT 'EM TO PASS, YOU DON'T GO BARGING IN AND SAY, "AHA, GOTCHA." YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE 'EM AT THEIR WORD. A FEW DAYS AFTER ANGIE SHARES HER EXPLICIT PHOTOS WITH JOHN, SHE FEELS SILLY ABOUT WORRYING WHAT JOHN MIGHT DO WITH THEM. ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2012, ANGIE WAS JUST AS HAPPY AS SHE COULD BE. HER EYES WERE SPARKLING BECAUSE SHE WAS... SHE WAS JUST THAT HAPPY. GOING FOR A WALK. BE BACK BY 10:00, MOM. COLLEEN HAS NO IDEA THAT HER TEENAGE GRANDDAUGHTER IS HEADING TO A DARK, HALF-EMPTY PARKING LOT TO MEET A STRANGER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE WE GOT A LITTLE LAX OR IF WE JUST KIND OF BACKED OFF A LITTLE BIT, AND IT... THINGS JUST SNOWBALLED FROM THERE. I... I... I DON'T KNOW. THE DAY AFTER HER RENDEZVOUS WITH HER ONLINE BOYFRIEND, ANGIE IS ON EDGE. ANGELA, HOW WAS YOUR DAY? HOW DO YOU THINK MY DAY WAS, YOU MORON? - LIKE, WHY DO YOU ASK ME SUCH STUPID QUESTIONS? - ANGELA, CALM DOWN. ON FRIDAY, AFTER WE GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL, IT KIND OF SEEMED LIKE ANGELA'S TRYING TO START AN ARGUMENT WITH ME. SHE JUST CAME IN AND STARTED, LIKE, NAGGING ME, YOU KNOW, JUST, LIKE, INSULTING ME LEFT AND RIGHT. - CALM DOWN? - YO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS... SETH AND ANGIE DID GET INTO AN ARGUMENT. DID I DO ANYTHING TO YOU? YOU TWO NEED TO KNOCK IT OFF AND KNOCK IT OFF NOW. THAT'S ALL YOU GOT IN THIS WORLD IS EACH OTHER. JUST BE NICE TO EACH OTHER, OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST GONNA GO TO JAKE'S. FINALLY. BACK IN THE MORNING. I'M GOING FOR A WALK. I WAS WATCHING TV TO SEE WHAT THE WEATHER WAS GONNA DO, AND... AND, THEN I WENT TO BED. THE NEXT MORNING, COLLEEN GOES TO WAKE UP ANGIE AS USUAL. ANGIE? I LOOKED IN ANGIE'S ROOM, AND HER BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN. I HAD NO CLUE WHERE ANGELA WAS AT. I EVEN TRIED CALLING HER PHONE. I NEVER GOT ANY RESPONSE. I CALLED SETH AND TOLD SETH THAT HE NEEDED TO GET HOME AND THAT WE HAD A FAMILY CRISIS GOING ON. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S ALL THE PANIC ABOUT? ANGIE NEVER CAME HOME LAST NIGHT. CAN YOU THINK OF WHERE SHE'S AT? - I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SHE'S AT A FRIEND'S. DID YOU TRY LAURA? MAYBE SHE'S JUST STILL ASLEEP AND SHE'LL BE HOME IN A LITTLE BIT. AND I GUESS... I GUESS, JUST, ME... ME AND MY MOM WERE JUST, LIKE, REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS JUST OUT OF THE ORDINARY FOR HER. WE CALLED THE POLICE. AND I TOLD 'EM WHAT HAD HAPPENED. AND HE SAID," SHE JUST RUN AWAY." THE PATROL OFFICERS THAT RESPONDED SATURDAY MORNING, THEY INITIALLY THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST A ROUTINE RUNAWAY REPORT. SINCE RUNAWAY CASES DON'T IMMEDIATELY TRIGGER POLICE ACTION, COLLEEN AND SETH HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WAIT FOR ANGIE TO TURN UP OF HER OWN VOLITION. BUT A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER, A FRIEND OF ANGIE'S ARRIVES WITH GOOD NEWS. HI. I JUST GOT THIS TEXT FROM ANGIE. COLLEEN READS ANGIE'S TEXT. SHE SAYS SHE'S WITH SOMEONE NAMED JASON. SHE WAS IN A CAMARO HEADED TOWARDS LITTLE ROCK. I KNEW THAT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT. THAT'S NOT ANGIE. I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE PEOPLE. AND SHE WOULDN'T BE GOING TO LITTLE ROCK WITHOUT TALKING TO US ABOUT IT. I TOLD THE POLICE ABOUT THE TEXT MESSAGES. COLLEEN IS SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE MESSAGE. BUT, TO THE POLICE, IT DOESN'T CHANGE THEIR VIEW THAT SHE'S PROBABLY JUST A RUNAWAY. MEANWHILE, IN THEIR SEARCH FOR ANGIE, SETH AND CHEYENNE PASS BY EARL DELMAR PIGG'S HOUSE UNAWARE HE HAS A RECORD. AT THAT TIME, HE WAS OUT ON BOND, FOR ONE COUNT. I BELIEVE IT WAS RAPE, UM, OF A YOUNGER GIRL. AND I BELIEVE SHE WAS 15, 16, WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN THE SAME AGE OF ANGELA ALLEN. I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS GIRL. IF I HEAR ANYTHING, I'LL TOUCH BASE RIGHT AWAY. IT'S NOW MONDAY. ANGIE WAS LAST SEEN THREE DAYS AGO LEAVING FOR A WALK ON FRIDAY NIGHT. SETH COMBS THE NEIGHBORHOOD, DESPERATE TO FIND HIS SISTER. PATROL OFFICERS CHECKED WITH THE FAMILY, FRIENDS AND PRETTY MUCH RULED OUT ANYBODY THAT SHE WAS CLOSE TO. THAT'S AT THE POINT THAT WE DECIDED, "OKAY. WELL, MAYBE THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A RUNAWAY. LET'S START LOOKING INTO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE." FIVE DAYS AFTER ANGIE DISAPPEARED, COLLEEN AND ANGIE'S BROTHER, SETH, ARE BESIDE THEMSELVES, AND THE POLICE CAN'T FIND A SINGLE LEAD ON ANGIE AS A RUNAWAY. THE VAN BUREN POLICE DECIDE THAT THEY NEED TO REACH OUT TO THE FBI. IT WAS FEBRUARY 15th, WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL THAT, ADVISED THAT THERE WAS AN ENDANGERED RUNAWAY FROM VAN BUREN, ARKANSAS. THE CONCERN AT THE TIME WAS THAT THEY HAD RUN OUT OF LEADS AS TO... TO WHERE SHE WAS. SINCE THE FBI HAD GOTTEN INVOLVED IN IT, YOU KNOW, I FELT THAT WE WERE GONNA ACTUALLY MAKE SOME PROGRESS. ME AND MY MOM WERE THINKING, YOU KNOW, "SHE'S GONNA BE HOME SOON," YOU KNOW, "WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR ANGELA BACK." PATTI? IT'S JIM. I NEED YOUR HELP. INVESTIGATOR PATTI STROUD KNOWS SHE HAS HER WORK CUT OUT FOR HER. ANGIE ALREADY HAS A 5-DAY HEAD START. I LOOKED FOR INFORMATION THROUGH THE INTERNET TO LOCATE PEOPLE, AND THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO DO, WHAT I FELT WAS IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE, WAS TRACKING HER CELLPHONE RECORD. ANALYZING ANGIE'S CELLPHONE ACTIVITY MEANS SORTING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF MESSAGES, ALL RANDOM, WITHOUT CORRESPONDING DATES OR TIMES. AT THIS POINT, EVERYBODY WAS ON MY RADAR. SHE'S VERY ACTIVE IN... ON THE INTERNET. WE FOUND WHERE SHE'D BEEN IN CONTACT WITH SEVERAL OUT-OF-STATE PHONE NUMBERS AS WELL AS LOCAL. INVESTIGATOR STROUD STARTS TO MATCH EACH TEXT WITH ITS REPLY. SOON, A FEW NUMBERS LEAP OUT. ONE IN PARTICULAR IS VERY WORRYING. THERE WAS ONE GUY, MR. WILKINSON, THAT WAS FROM CABOT THAT WAS A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. RIGHT NOW, HE POTENTIALLY IS A SUSPECT. YEP. WE HAVE TO PICK UP WILKINSON RIGHT AWAY. 16-YEAR-OLD ANGIE ALLEN HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 5 DAYS. INVESTIGATORS HAVE ZEROED IN ON A POSSIBLE SUSPECT, A CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER WHOSE PHONE NUMBER SHOWS UP IN ANGIE'S CELL RECORDS. INVESTIGATOR PATTI STROUD KNOWS THEY NEED TO FIND ANGIE'S CELLPHONE FAST. EVERY TEENAGE GIRL, THEY LOVE THEIR CELLPHONE, SO THEY'RE GONNA KEEP THOSE CLOSE, ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE RAN AWAY. SO I REALLY FELT THAT WE NEEDED TO DO AN EMERGENCY PHONE PING AND, SEE IF WE COULD TRACK HER LOCATION ON HER CELLPHONE. ACCORDING TO HER PHONE RECORDS, THE LAST TIME ANGIE USED HER CELLPHONE WAS SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11th, TO TEXT HER FRIEND THAT SHE WAS IN A CAMARO HEADING FOR LITTLE ROCK. DETECTIVES GO TO THE EXACT PLACE INDICATED BY ANGIE'S PHONE PING, ON HIGHWAY 22 NEAR LAVACA, ARKANSAS. BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, AND THE LOCATION YIELDS NOTHING. I SENT A DETECTIVE DOWN TO THAT AREA TO TRACK WHERE THAT PHONE WAS, BUT WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE PHONE OR ANGELA. MORE DISAPPOINTING NEWS COMES NEXT. CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER MR. WILKINSON HAS AN ALIBI FOR THE NIGHT OF ANGIE'S DISAPPEARANCE. HE'S CLEARED OF SUSPICION. THEN, JUST AS INVESTIGATORS SEEM TO BE HITTING A DEAD-END, COLLEEN GETS A SURPRISE OFFER OF HELP. EARL PIGG. HE DID COME AROUND. HE, HE TRIED TO HELP FIND ANGIE. HE EVEN GAVE ME HIS NUMBER. UNCOMFORTABLE, COLLEEN CALLS THE POLICE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANGELA. AND THEY KNOW WHO I WAS TALKING ABOUT RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THAT POPPED DELMAR UP ON THE RADAR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AS SOMEBODY TO BE INTERESTED IN. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR SUSPECTS TO INSERT THEMSELVES INTO THE INVESTIGATION. KNOWING HIM, KNOWING WHAT HE HAD BEEN, DOING IN THE PAST, IF HE'S COME FORWARD AND INJECTED HIMSELF IN THE INVESTIGATION, THEN THERE'S A REASON BEHIND THAT. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ANGIE FOR SIX DAYS, AND NOW INVESTIGATOR STROUD FINALLY IDENTIFIES WHOM ANGIE LAST TEXTED ON THE NIGHT SHE VANISHED. IT'S NOT HER ONLINE BOYFRIEND OF A FEW WEEKS, JOHN, OR JASON, THE GUY WITH THE CAMARO. I'VE GOT A NAME. I'VE GOT A NUMBER. THE NUMBER BELONGS TO A MAN NAMED LLOYD COLLINS JONES. ONCE WE SEE THE NAME LLOYD COLLINS JONES, THEN THINGS KICKED INTO OVERDRIVE. HE IS SOMEBODY THAT CAN TELL US, IF HE'S INCLINED TO TALK TO US, "I MET WITH HER. I LEFT. THIS HAPPENED AFTER I LEFT." LLOYD COULD'VE BEEN A WEALTH OF INFORMATION, HAD HE BEEN JUST AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE THE LAST PHONE CONTACT WITH HER, LEFT AND HAD NO INVOLVEMENT. SPECIAL AGENT CAUDLE TRACES 36-YEAR-OLD LLOYD COLLINS JONES TO A FARM WHERE HE WORKS IN LAVACA. AND IT'S CLOSE TO WHERE ANGIE SENT HER LAST TEXT ABOUT BEING IN A BLACK CAMARO. HE AGREED TO COME IN, SO THEY TRANSPORTED HIM INTO THE... THE CRAWFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. MEANWHILE, INVESTIGATOR STROUD PORES OVER ANGIE'S CELLPHONE RECORDS. SHE NEEDS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH JONES. WE ESSENTIALLY ARE TRYING TO... TO LEARN, FROM... FROM LLOYD, HOW HE CAME TO KNOW ANGELA, HOW THEY MET, WHEN THEY MET, HOW LONG THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER, IF HE COULD JUST EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP TO US. ANGELA ALLEN, DO YOU KNOW HER? I KNOW HER. HE WAS VERY FORTHCOMING. I'M A LEVEL-3 SEX OFFENDER, AND I ENJOY MEETING YOUNG WOMEN ONLINE. BUT HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE 18 YEARS OLD OR OLDER. THEY HAD MET APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10th. THEY HAD MET ONLINE OVER A WEBSITE CALLED MBUZZY. THAT WAS A NEW ONE TO ME. INVESTIGATOR STROUD IS TRYING TO PLOW THROUGH ANGIE'S CELLPHONE RECORDS BEFORE JONES WALKS OUT THE DOOR. WHEN LLOYD WAS BEING QUESTIONED, I HAD PROBABLY 200 OR 300 PAGES OF TEXT THAT I'M TRYING TO GO THROUGH TO TRY TO SORT OUT THEIR CONVERSATION AND TRY TO GIVE THEM MORE INFORMATION TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. IN THE RACE TO FIND ANGIE, INVESTIGATOR STROUD KNOWS SHE'S PROBABLY HOLDING THE ONLY CLUES THAT MIGHT SAVE HER, AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT. WE'RE TREADING VERY LIGHTLY BECAUSE, AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YET TO REFUTE WHAT HE'S SAYING, AND, QUITE FRANKLY, HIS... HIS STORY IS VERY PLAUSIBLE. WE MET ON A FRIDAY ABOUT 6:00, 6:30. IT WAS IN A PARKING LOT IN A HOSPITAL. VAN BUREN HOSPITAL IS, WITHIN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD AS ANGELA ALLEN'S HOME. SHE SHOWED UP. SHE GETS IN THE TRUCK, AND THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION. HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD. SO IT'S REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU. SHE THEN DECIDES TO TELL HIM THAT SHE'S ONLY 16. UM, I'M ACTUALLY 16. SHE SAID 16, AND I FLIPPED OUT. I MEAN, I CAN GET CLIPPED JUST FOR HAVING HER IN MY TRUCK. DEFINE "FLIPPED OUT." GET OUT. HE SAID HE PANICKED BECAUSE HE'S A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. HE KNEW HER BEING IN HIS TRUCK WITH HIM, THAT WAS ENOUGH TO GET HIM SENT BACK TO... TO JAIL. I KICKED HER OUT OF THE TRUCK. GET OUT! THEN JONES DROPS A BOMBSHELL. HE TELLS US THAT A BLACK CAMARO PULLS IN BEHIND HIM, AND SHE JUMPS OUT AND HEADS BACK TO THE BLACK CAMARO. ANGIE HAD TEXTED HER FRIEND ABOUT BEING IN A BLACK CAMARO THE DAY SHE WAS REPORTED MISSING. SOME BLACK CAMARO PULLED UP BEHIND ME. SHE GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK. SHE GOT INTO THE CAR. THAT'S THE LAST I SAW OF HER. THAT'S IT. SHE JUST DROVE OFF INTO THE NIGHT? THAT'S IT. WHEN LLOYD PROVIDED THIS TEXT-MESSAGE ALIBI ABOUT THE BLACK CAMARO, CONCERN WENT UP. WE WEREN'T REALLY BUYING THAT STORY. MIND IF I TAKE A SMOKE BREAK? THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. LET'S TAKE A BREAK. THAT GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT, MEET WITH SOME OF THE INVESTIGATORS WHO WERE WAITING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET ANYTHING THAT EITHER CORROBORATES THE STORY THROUGH THE TEXT MESSAGES, THROUGH THE CELLULAR DATA THAT... THAT... THAT PATTI'S WORKING ON, OR IF IT SHOWS US THAT... THAT HE'S BEING LESS THAN TRUTHFUL TO US. I KEPT THINKING, "SHE'S GONNA WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR. I'M GONNA HUG HER, AND I'M GONNA LOVE HER, AND THEN I'M GONNA YELL AT HER AND I'M GONNA GROUND HER. I'M GONNA TAKE THAT PHONE. I'M GONNA BREAK IT. BUT I'M GONNA HUG HER AGAIN." I KEPT ON TELLING MYSELF, "IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY." ANGIE. 16-YEAR-OLD ANGIE ALLEN HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 6 DAYS, BUT HER GRANDMOTHER, COLLEEN, IS STILL EXPECTING HER TO WALK THROUGH THE DOOR. ANGIE. I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE ANGIE. I... I TOLD MY MOM, I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS." NO, DON'T YOU DARE BE NEGATIVE. AND MY MOM LOOKED AT ME, AND SHE SAID, "DON'T YOU EVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN." IT WAS JUST REALLY STARTING TO GET TO ME. FOLLOWING HIS INTERROGATION WITH KNOWN SEX OFFENDER LLOYD COLLINS JONES, SPECIAL AGENT CAUDLE FINDS SOME TROUBLING DISCREPANCIES IN JONES' ACCOUNT OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGIE. WHY DON'T YOU LOSE THAT HAT? I HAD RECEIVED SOME DOCUMENTS FROM PATTI STROUD REGARDING TEXT MESSAGES. SO NOW I HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT I CAN ATTACK HIM WITH. LLOYD, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY UP FRONT WITH US. LLOYD'S STANDING HAS REALLY CHANGED NOW FROM WITNESS TO SUSPECT. WITH EVIDENCE POINTING HARDER AT JONES, QUESTIONS ABOUT SUSPECTED RAPIST EARL DELMAR PIGG START TO FADE. ONCE WE, UM, GOT THE TEXT MESSAGES WITH, LLOYD JONES, WE... WE PRETTY MUCH PUT MR. PIGG ASIDE. STILL, MR. PIGG ISN'T OFF THE HOOK. A SECOND VICTIM COMES FORWARD IN HIS RAPE CASE, AND SOON HE'S SERVING TIME FOR 11 COUNTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. SPECIAL AGENT CAUDLE NOW BELIEVES THAT LLOYD JONES ABDUCTED ANGIE THAT FRIDAY NIGHT IN FEBRUARY. BUT INVESTIGATOR STROUD IS STILL PORING OVER ANGIE'S PHONE RECORDS, TRYING TO FIND DIRECT EVIDENCE OF JONES' CONNECTION TO ANGIE'S DISAPPEARANCE. I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW. I'M TELLING YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. AT LAST, STROUD ORGANIZES ALL OF ANGIE'S RANDOM CELLPHONE DATA INTO A TIMELINE, AND THE TRUE STORY EMERGES. GO AHEAD. I JUST GOT A TEXT. WHEN I GOT TO PUT 'EM IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER AND VIEW THE TEXT MESSAGES, IT REALLY APPEARED TO ME THAT HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS YOUNG. HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT 18. LLOYD JONES HAD USED JOHN AS A FAKE NAME FOR A BOYFRIEND. KID THOUGHT SHE WAS MEETING A GUY NAMED JOHN. WE DETERMINED THAT SHE'D BEEN TALKING TO LLOYD JONES. HE'S 36 YEARS OLD, TELLING HER HE'S 17. THE FIRST TIME SHE MET HIM, I BELIEVE THEY MET AT THE HOSPITAL PARKING LOT, AND SHE CAME OVER TO HIS TRUCK. THE WAY THE TEXT MESSAGES READ IS THAT SHE WENT TO THE TRUCK, BUT SHE WOULDN'T GET INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE. HEY, GIRL. WHY DON'T YOU HOP ON IN? ANGIE RUNS BACK HOME AFTER HER FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH JOHN THAT THURSDAY NIGHT. SHE REALIZES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE'S NOT WHO HE SAYS HE IS, AND HE'S NOT 17. INVESTIGATOR STROUD SEARCHES FOR TEXTS TO EXPLAIN WHY ANGIE WENT BACK FOR THAT SECOND MEETING THE NEXT NIGHT. HE WAS BASICALLY BLACKMAILING HER TO GET HER TO MEET HIM AGAIN. AFTER JONES PRESSURED ANGIE INTO SENDING HIM TOPLESS SELFIES, HE KNEW SHE WAS HIS PRISONER. HE COULD MAKE HER DO ANYTHING HE WANTED AT ANY TIME. HE TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD SHOW EVERYBODY AT HER SCHOOL. SO HE... HE BLACKMAILED HER WITH THE PICTURES TO MEET HIM. AT THE END, THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO MEET HIM. THEY HAD ARRANGED TO MEET AGAIN IN THE PARKING LOT. THE LAST MESSAGE, THAT HE... HE SEES HER, HE SENDS HER A TEXT THAT SAYS, "HEY, BABY." HEY, BABY GIRL. HI. WHY DON'T YOU COME ON IN? YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SHOW THOSE PRETTY PICTURES TO YOUR FRIENDS, DO YOU? A LOT OF TIMES, TEENAGERS FEEL THAT THEY'RE INVINCIBLE. I WANT A LAWYER. THE INTERVIEW ENDS. HE ASKS TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY. EVEN IN THE FACE OF SO MUCH EVIDENCE, JONES REFUSES TO CONFESS. IT'S NEARLY A WEEK AFTER ANGIE VANISHED, AND SPECIAL AGENT CAUDLE IS NO CLOSER TO KNOWING WHERE SHE IS. CAUDLE'S COLLEAGUE, SPECIAL AGENT TIM ATKINS, PAYS A VISIT TO JONES' GIRLFRIEND. IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN LLOYD. SHE WAS TELLING TIM THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT LLOYD COULD'VE DONE THIS. HE WAS WORKING ON THEIR HOUSE. THEY WERE BUILDING, FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM, A SHACK ON A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT A FAMILY MEMBER OWNED THAT WAS NOT FAR FROM... FROM WHERE THEY WERE LIVING. AND HE CAME HOME THAT EVENING ALL MUDDY. AMANDA'S STORY WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN WORKING THAT EVENING ON THE SHACK, AND... AND SHE KNEW THAT FOR A FACT BECAUSE HE CAME HOME MUDDY. UM, HE WAS WORKING UNDER THE FOUNDATION. SHE THINKS SHE'S GIVEN JONES AN ALIBI. INSTEAD, SHE'S GIVEN DETECTIVES THEIR BIGGEST CLUE YET, AND IT'S OMINOUS. OUR FEAR IS BEING REALIZED THAT WE'RE... WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING FOR A BODY. BUT NOW WE'RE STARTING TO THINK BURIAL. THAT WAS DEFINITELY A DEFINING MOMENT FOR US. WE'RE ALREADY THINKING WORST-CASE SCENARIO. OUR DECISION WAS, "LET'S START WITH THE SHACK." INVESTIGATORS ARRIVE AT A BLEAK, HALF-BUILT SHACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARKANSAS WOODS. A, LADY THAT HAD A DOG ARRIVED AT THE, THE SITE. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AROUND, SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND. BE AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE, OKAY? AND YOU AND YOU, COME WITH ME. I'M GONNA CHECK OUT THIS SHACK. THE DOG STARTED HIS SEARCHING AND INITIALLY HITS ON... ON THE INSIDE. AND THEN WENT AROUND TO THE BACK SIDE... ...AND HIT. GUYS, WE GOT A HIT. GET IN THERE, GUYS. SAW AN AREA THAT, YOU COULD TELL HAD RECENTLY BEEN DUG UP AND... AND... AND DIRT HAD BEEN... BEEN PILED OVER. THE INVESTIGATORS STARTED JUST USING THEIR HANDS... THROW IT AWAY. ...BECAUSE IT WAS LOOSE-ENOUGH DIRT AND STARTED SCRAPING AWAY. THEY CAME ACROSS A BLUE BARREL. IN THEIR SEARCH FOR MISSING TEENAGER ANGIE ALLEN, INVESTIGATORS HAVE DESCENDED ON A REMOTE SHACK OWNED BY PRIME SUSPECT LLOYD COLLINS JONES. THEY'VE JUST DISCOVERED A RECENTLY BURIED BARREL. THEY UNCOVERED ENOUGH OF THE BARREL TO FIND AN OPENING THAT WAS STRAPPED SHUT. AND, THIS WAS A PLASTIC BARREL, SO THEY WERE ABLE TO... TO PRY THE OPENING APART ENOUGH TO WHERE ONE OF THE OFFICERS WAS ABLE TO REACH HIS HAND IN. JESUS. SHE WAS STRANGLED. UM, IN ORDER TO PLACE HER BODY IN THE BARREL, APPARENTLY, ONE OF HER KNEES, HAD BEEN SAWED TO A DEGREE THAT HER BODY COULD BE... BE PLACED IN... IN THIS BARREL. WE DID EXPECT, COMING IN, TO... TO THIS ASPECT OF THE INVESTIGATION, THIS IS WHERE IT WAS GOING. SO THERE WAS A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GIVE SOME CLOSURE TO... TO ANGELA'S FAMILY. LLOYD JONES IS CHARGED WITH THE HOMICIDE OF 16-YEAR-OLD ANGIE ALLEN. SETH. SETH.. WHEN ANGIE'S FAMILY RECEIVES THE NEWS THEY'VE BEEN DREADING FOR SIX DAYS, IT'S UNBEARABLE. I REMEMBER COMING OUT THAT DOOR AND JUST HUGGING HIM AND JUST CRYING. LIKE, IT WAS JUST, LIKE, DEVA... DEV... DIDN'T WANT TO... WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAPPENED TO HER. BUT IT WAS JUST, LIKE... LIKE... LIKE, ALMOST FELT LIKE I JUST LOST, LIKE, MY BEST FRIEND. LIKE, HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT TO SOMEONE SO YOUNG AND SO INNOCENT? LIKE... LIKE, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? LIKE, THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT. LIKE, THAT'S... LIKE, THAT'S SOMEBODY'S, LIKE, SISTER, DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW, LIKE, AUNT OR MOM, YOU KNOW. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. IT... IT WAS SICKENING. I THINK LLOYD'S A COWARD. HE TOOK AWAY HER DREAMS. HE TOOK AWAY HER FAMILY BEING ABLE TO SEE HER GROW UP. IT'S SO SENSELESS. IT'S JUST SENSELESS. SHE HAD DIED RIGHT THERE AT... AT LLOYD JONES' PROPERTY. WE HAD A, OPEN CASKET, AND WE COULD SEE WHERE, LIKE, EVEN THROUGH ALL THE MAKEUP, LIKE, WHERE HE HAD BEATEN HER AND BRUISED HER AND EVERYTHING. AND IT'S... IT... IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ANGIE. LIKE, I KNEW IT WAS, BUT, LIKE, IT WAS JUST... AT... AT THAT POINT, IT WAS JUST LIKE I HAD... I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT JUST HIT, LIKE, ROCK BOTTOM. LIKE, THAT WAS, LIKE, THE LOWEST I COULD GET. LLOYD JONES PLEADED GUILTY TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND WAS SENTENCED TO 60 YEARS IN PRISON. ANGIE'S GRANDMOTHER IS NOW PETITIONING TO CHANGE THE TREATMENT OF CONVICTED SEX OFFENDERS. SHE CALLS IT ANGELA'S LAW. LLOYD COLLINS JONES WAS A LEVEL-3 SEX OFFENDER. HE GOT OUT ON GOOD BEHAVIOR. HE SHOULD'VE NEVER BEEN LET OUT. HE SHOULD'VE BEEN MADE TO SERVE HIS FULL TIME. OUR LAWS HAVE TO CHANGE TO FIT TODAY'S SOCIETY. AND THEY'RE NOT. I'M HOPING THAT ANGELA'S LAW DOES GET PASSED. IF YOU ARE A SEX OFFENDER, YOU DON'T GET OUT FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. YOU HAVE TO SERVE ALL OF YOUR TIME, EVERY BIT OF IT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANOTHER CHILD DOES NOT GO THROUGH WHAT ANGELA WENT THROUGH OR WHAT MY FAMILY AND I WENT THROUGH. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
