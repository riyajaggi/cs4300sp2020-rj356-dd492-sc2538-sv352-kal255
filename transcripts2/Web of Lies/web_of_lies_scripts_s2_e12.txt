 THIS CASE JUST WENT FROM ZERO TO A HUNDRED IN NO TIME FLAT. Narrator: 11-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN BLOXOM IS THE SECOND OF FOUR BROTHERS. HE'S AN AVID SKATEBOARDER AND PLAYS ON THE SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. Amy: JUSTIN WANTED EVERYBODY TO HAVE A GREAT TIME. IF YOU WERE HAVIN' A BAD DAY, JUSTIN WAS GONNA MAKE SURE HE TURNED YOUR DAY INTO A GREAT DAY. JUSTIN WOULD MAKE FOLDING CLOTHES FUN. Narrator: BUT HE'S ALSO A SIXTH-GRADER WITH A SECRET. HEY, HON. WHAT YOU DOIN'? I'M JUST FINISHING MY MATH HOMEWORK. - OH, YOU WANT SOME HELP? - NO.

 IT'S FINE, MAMA. I'M ALMOST DONE. ALL RIGHT. WELL, HURRY UP. IT'S ALMOST LIGHTS OUT. OKAY. I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I'M FINISHED. OKAY. Narrator: ALTHOUGH HIS PARENTS ARE SEPARATED, AMY AND JUSTIN'S FATHER, KEVIN, BOTH WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR SONS DON'T GROW UP TOO QUICKLY. THEY TELL JUSTIN TO STAY OFF SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. WE TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS TOO YOUNG, UM, TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE SITES. HE DIDN'T NEED ONE. Narrator: BUT WITH MYSPACE ALL THE RAGE AT SCHOOL, JUSTIN CAN'T RESIST SETTING UP HIS OWN ACCOUNT. MYSPACE WAS A WAY FOR US TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND, YOU KNOW, SAY WHAT'S GOIN' ON IN OUR LIVES. AND WE COULD CREATE IT AND MAKE IT OUR OWN. Narrator: AMONG HIS TOP EIGHT CONNECTIONS IS JUSTIN'S BEST FRIEND DUSTIN ROSEGRANT. ME AND JUSTIN, WE JUST HUNG OUT A LOT. WE WOULD TALK AND THEN, I GUESS, THE MORE WE HUNG OUT, THE CLOSER WE GOT AND JUST BUILT UP A BOND. Narrator: OBLIVIOUS TO HIS MOTHER'S CONCERNS, JUSTIN SOON STARTS TO EXPLORE WHAT THE ONLINE WORLD OFFERS. BUT HIS SOCIAL NETWORKING DAYS ARE SHORT-LIVED. [ DING ] JUSTIN'S SITE HAD NOT BEEN UP VERY LONG BECAUSE JUSTIN'S FATHER CAME ACROSS THE ACCOUNT. AND WHEN JUSTIN'S FATHER CAME ACROSS THE ACCOUNT AND MADE ME MORE AWARE OF IT, THEN, YES, I PULLED IT UP THEN, THE ACCOUNT, AND LOOKED AT IT. AND THE ONE THING THAT I ZOOMED IN ON WAS WHAT JUSTIN HAD NAMED HIMSELF, AND IT WAS "YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD SUPER PIMP." JUSTIN! JUSTIN! ♪♪ JUSTIN! JUSTIN! WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU? YOU ARE MUCH TOO YOUNG TO BE ON MYSPACE. AND I ASKED JUSTIN, I SAID, "SO TELL ME ABOUT THIS MYSPACE ACCOUNT." HE KNEW THEN HE'D BEEN BUSTED. AND WHAT IS THIS YOU CALLIN' YOURSELF A SUPER PIMP? IT'S LIKE A SUPERHERO, KINDA LIKE SPIDER-MAN. OH, HONEY. NO, IT'S NOT. A- A PIMP IS LIKE... A REALLY BAD MAN THAT MAKES MONEY OFF OF WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND, HON? YES, MAMA. I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT THAT TYPE OF, I GUESS, JOB TITLE REALLY IS, AND IT UPSET HIM. THE TEARS WELLED UP IN THE EYES BECAUSE IT... HE WAS... I GUESS HE WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED IN HIMSELF AS WELL. PROMISE ME. PROMISE ME NO MORE MYSPACE. JUSTIN, IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. I PROMISE, MAMA. I EXPLAINED TO JUSTIN THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT PUTTING THINGS OUT THERE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. YOU KNOW, I SAID, "THINGS GET MISCONSTRUED." AND I SAID, "AND YOU... "PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT YOU AS A DIFFERENT PERSON JUST BASED ON WHAT YOU PUT OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WIDE WEB." Narrator: JUSTIN NEVER GOES ON MYSPACE AGAIN, ALTHOUGH HIS ABANDONED ACCOUNT, INCLUDING PICTURES OF HIM, REMAINS ONLINE. A LITTLE OVER A YEAR LATER, JUSTIN IS WEEKS AWAY FROM HIS 13th BIRTHDAY. - HERE YOU GO. - OH, YOU'RE JUST FIRED UP TODAY. THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA TAKE IT. LOOK AT YOU. GIVE IT. Amy: JUSTIN WOULD TEXT FROM WHEN HE GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL OFF AND ON TILL HE WOULD GO TO BED. IT WAS LOTS OF PEOPLE, HIS FRIENDS, FAMILY. DUSTIN'S COMIN' OVER. HE WAS AVERAGIN' ABOUT 2,000 TEXTS A MONTH. Y'ALL GOTTA FINISH YOU LUNCH FIRST. AW, MAMA. NO, "AW, MAMA" ME. FINE. FINE? ALL OF IT. FINISHED! [ Whispers ] THAT LITTLE SCAMP. Dustin: LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT FISH. I THINK YOU GOT SOMETHING. DUSTIN, LOOK AT THAT. DOWN THERE. DO YOU SEE IT? AW, WAY TO GO, JUSTIN! DUDE, IT'S HUGE. [ CELL PHONE ALERT CHIMES ] IS THAT KAITLYN? NO, TYLER. TYLER YOUR BROTHER? WHAT'S HE SAYING? IT'S NOT HIM. IT'S TYLER CUMMINGS. SHE'S FROM OUT OF TOWN. SO LET ME GET THIS RIGHT. TYLER'S NOW YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BUT NOT KAITLYN? I SUPPOSE. [ SIGHS ] JUSTIN, JUSTIN, JUSTIN. I THINK I GOT SOMETHING. Narrator: WITH THE START OF SPRING BREAK, DUSTIN HAS ASKED JUSTIN TO COME OVER TO HIS HOUSE FOR A SLEEPOVER. I ASKED MY MOM, AND SHE SAID, "OKAY. CLEAN YOUR ROOM, AND JUSTIN CAN COME OVER." Narrator: AT AROUND 6:00 P.M., AMY DRIVES JUSTIN OVER TO HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE. I REMEMBER DRIVIN' DOWN OUR DRIVEWAY, AND THE MOON WAS SO BIG AND FULL. IT WAS COMIN' UP. [ DOG BARKING ] THE ROSEGRANTS LIVED MAYBE SIX, SEVEN MINUTES FROM US. [ MAKES KISS SOUND ] MWAH. ALL RIGHT. I LOVE YOU, SON. I LOVE YOU TOO, MAMA. Narrator: IT'S ARRANGED THAT JUSTIN WILL BE PICKED UP BY HIS OLDER BROTHER TYLER IN THE MORNING. Dustin: WELL, WHENEVER WE AND JUSTIN WERE INSIDE, I KNOW HE LIKED TO TEXT A LOT. YOU KNOW, HE WOULD TEXT AND TALK AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO HE WAS SENDIN' A LOT, PROBABLY 100 MESSAGES AN HOUR. SO HOW'S TYLER? GOOD. WE'RE GONNA MEET UP. WHEN? I DON'T KNOW. - SOON. - COOL. HERE, HAVE SOME CHIPS. ARE YOU GONNA PLAY OR NOT? [ SIGHS ] YOU'RE BUTT-WHIPPED. Dustin: PROBABLY ABOUT 9:30 TO 10:00, I TOLD JUSTIN, I SAID, "HEY, I'M GETTIN' REAL TIRED. YOU WANT TO COME IN MY ROOM AND LAY DOWN?" JUSTIN WAS LIKE, "OKAY, SURE. I'LL COME IN THERE AND WATCH TV WITH YOU." AND THEN I STARTED WATCHING TV, AND HE WAS JUST SITTING DOWN THERE ON HIS PHONE. I STARTED GETTIN' A LITTLE TIRED. I LEANED OVER AND TOLD JUSTIN, "HERE, YOU CAN HAVE THE REMOTE. I'M ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP." JUSTIN. JUSTIN. TURN OFF THE TV WHEN YOU'RE DONE. YEAH, WHATEVER. AND THEN I WENT TO BED. [ TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY ] [ TURNS OFF TV ] [ DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE ] [ CELL PHONE ALERT CHIMES ] Dustin: AND THE NEXT MORNING, I WOKE UP PROBABLY ABOUT 8:30, 9:00 IN THE MORNING. AND I REMEMBER LEANING OVER THE BUNK BED AGAIN, LIKE I DID THE NIGHT BEFORE... AND JUSTIN WASN'T THERE. SO I GOT OFF THE BUNK BED, AND I-I WALKED IN THE LIVING ROOM TO THE COUCHES AND DIDN'T SEE NOBODY. JUSTIN? AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED GETTIN' A LITTLE WORRIED. I WAS LIKE, "OKAY. WHERE COULD HE BE? BECAUSE THIS AIN'T NORMAL." SO I WALKED OUTSIDE TO SEE IF, YOU KNOW, HE WAS UP ON THE PHONE OR SOMETHING AND WANTED SOME PRIVACY. JUSTIN, IF YOU'RE HIDING, IT'S NOT FUNNY. JUSTIN! SO I WALKED OUTSIDE AND LOOKED AROUND AND DIDN'T SEE HIM, AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED REALLY, YOU KNOW, PANICKING. JUSTIN! WE CALLED MY MOM, AND SAID, "HEY, WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO? BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND JUSTIN." AND SHE TOLD US TO GO CHECK AT JUSTIN'S HOUSE AND SEE IF MISS AMY MIGHT HAVE COME AND GOT HIM THAT MORNIN' OR SOMETHIN'. Narrator: HOPES OF FINDING JUSTIN NOW REST WITH HIM HAVING MADE THE 10-MINUTE JOURNEY BACK TO HIS OWN HOUSE. HEY. HERE IS JUSTIN'S STUFF. AND TYLER WAS A LITTLE CAUGHT OFF GUARD AND SAID, "WELL, WHERE'S JUSTIN AT?" AND I WAS, "I THOUGHT HE WAS AT HOME." HE'S HERE, RIGHT? TYLER GOES, "NO, HE'S NOT AT HOME. - ARE YOU PLAYIN' A TRICK?" - REALLY? "'CAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY." AMY, A MEDIA SALES MANAGER, IS ON HER WAY TO HER FIRST APPOINTMENT. Amy: TYLER CALLS AND SAYS, "MOM, DID... DID YOU GO PICK UP JUSTIN?" I SAID, "NO." I SAID, "JUSTIN STAYED THE NIGHT AT DUSTIN'S HOUSE." AND HE SAID, "WELL, HE'S NOT THERE." I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HE'S NOT THERE?" THEY WOKE UP, AND JUSTIN WASN'T THERE. I SAID, "YOU NEED TO CALL 9-1-1, AND I'M ON MY WAY." Narrator: AFTER A SLEEPOVER AT HIS HOUSE, DUSTIN ROSEGRANT WAKES UP EXPECTING TO SEE HIS BEST FRIEND, 12-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN BLOXOM, IN THE BUNK BELOW HIM. WHERE ARE YOU, JUSTIN? BUT JUSTIN ISN'T THERE. JUSTIN? Narrator: AT 10:30 A.M., JUSTIN'S FAMILY REPORTS HIM MISSING TO POLICE. DETECTIVE ADAM EWING TAKES CHARGE OF THE CASE. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. Ewing: BUT WHEN IT'S A CHILD, WE'RE GONNA RESPOND. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT OR WAIT FOR TIME TO PASS 'CAUSE EVERY SECOND COUNTS UNTIL WE CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON. WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND. Narrator: POLICE ASK THE BLOXOMS TO MEET AT THE LAST PLACE JUSTIN HAD BEEN SEEN, THE ROSEGRANT HOUSE. INITIALLY, WE FIGURED THAT JUSTIN HAD SNUCK OUT OF HIS HOUSE OR HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE AND HAD... WAS GONNA BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH HIS MOM. JUSTIN, IT'S MAMA. NO ONE'S GONNA GET MAD AT YOU. PLEASE CALL AND LET US KNOW YOU'RE OKAY. WAS I SCARED YET? NO. I WAS NOT SCARED YET THAT SOMETHING BAD HAD HAPPENED TO JUSTIN. I DIDN'T KNOW IF JUSTIN HAD GOTTEN UP AND GONE SOMEWHERE. WHY HASN'T HE CALLED? [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Ewing: WE WERE IN THE DRIVEWAY WITHIN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES, AND I REALLY STARTED TO NOTICE THE ENTIRE... THE FAMILY, THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE PEOPLE, THE FRIENDS. YOU COULD TELL THAT NO ONE THERE HAD ANY IDEA. THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, JUST IN SHOCK. AND YOU COULD TELL JUST THE ATMOSPHERE OF IT THAT THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE JUST A CASE WHERE HE HAD SNUCK OFF WITH FRIENDS. GOOD AFTERNOON, I'M DETECTIVE EWING. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS? MISS AMY WAS REALLY, REALLY UPSET. HE'S ONLY 12. JUST... JUST FIND HIM. PLEASE. - RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND. - JUST FIND HIM! I UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE. I CAN'T PUT MYSELF IN HER SHOES. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THOSE SHOES. BUT IN MY OPINION, IT... IT WOULD BE ALMOST LIKE A ROLLER COASTER RIDE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON. WHENEVER THE COPS ASKED ME WHERE JUSTIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN, I TOLD THEM, "WELL, I KNOW JUSTIN HAS A GIRLFRIEND THAT GOES TO YOUREE MIDDLE SCHOOL." Narrator: JUSTIN'S NEW GIRLFRIEND, TYLER CUMMINGS, LIVES OVER 20 MILES FROM STONEWALL. TO GET THERE, JUSTIN WOULD HAVE NEEDED A RIDE. POLICE CHECK IF ANY CARS WERE SEEN IN THE AREA NEAR DUSTIN'S HOUSE LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE. Ewing: WHILE WE WERE AT THE ROSEGRANT HOME, A COUPLE NEIGHBORHOOD BOYS TOLD US THAT A NEIGHBOR, CHARLEY PATE, HAD SEEN A TAXICAB THAT MORNING APPROXIMATELY 2:00. Narrator: THE NEIGHBOR IS A TEACHER AT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL. Ewing: HE'D BEEN UP LATE THAT NIGHT WORKING ON A TERM PAPER. AND BECAUSE IT WAS A FULL MOON NIGHT, AND IT WAS NOT RAINING, NO CLOUDS, HE WAS ABLE TO SEE A TAXICAB GOIN' UP AND DOWN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. Narrator: WITH NO OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AT HIS DISPOSAL, THE ONLY WAY JUSTIN COULD HAVE TRAVELED ANY DISTANCE IS BY TAXI. THE SIGHTING OF A LATE-NIGHT CAB IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SEEMS TO BACK UP THIS THEORY. ALTHOUGH THE TEACHER COULDN'T SEE WHO WAS IN THE CAR, HE COULD SEE THE NAME OF THE CAB COMPANY... ACTION TAXIS. I WAS GEARED TOWARD FINDING A MISSING BOY WHO HAD, FOR WHATEVER REASON, GOTTEN INTO A TAXICAB AND LEFT THE RESIDENCE, MAYBE TO GO MEET A FRIEND, OR MAYBE HE WAS DOIN' SOMETHING JUST COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED. BUT I WAS STILL IN THE MIND-SET THAT WE WERE GOING TO FIND HIM SAFE AND SOUND. Narrator: AN OFFICER IS DISPATCHED TO CHECK WHETHER JUSTIN HAS BEEN TO VISIT TYLER CUMMINGS. I WAS IN CLASS, AND, UH, THE POLICE OFFICER, HE CAME IN AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO ME. WHEN A POLICE OFFICER COMES AND SPEAKS TO YOU, YOU KIND OF GET FREAKED OUT. AND HE TOLD ME HOW JUSTIN WAS MISSING, AND THEY COULDN'T FIND HIM, AND THEY WERE WONDERING IF I KNEW ANYTHING. Narrator: THE POLICE SOON CONFIRM JUSTIN DIDN'T GO TO TYLER'S LAST NIGHT. WHERE WOULD HE HANG OUT? DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? I TOLD HIM, NO, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS. I HADN'T HEARD FROM HIM. THE ONLY THING I KNEW WAS THAT HE WAS AT HIS FRIEND DUSTIN'S HOUSE. Amy: THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS GOIN' THROUGH MY HEAD. ALL I COULD DO WAS JUST PRAY AND JUST... I MEAN, I JUST NEEDED TO FIND HIM, FIND WHERE HE WAS AT. Narrator: IT'S BEEN THREE HOURS SINCE HIS FAMILY CALLED IN 12-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN BLOXOM AS A MISSING PERSON. POLICE BELIEVE THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT JUSTIN SNUCK OUT TO MEET A FRIEND. BUT THE QUESTION OF WHO THAT FRIEND IS REMAINS UNANSWERED. THEY HOPE JUSTIN'S PHONE RECORDS MIGHT PROVIDE A LEAD. THE LOGS SHOW AFTER TYLER CUMMINGS STOPPED TEXTING AT 9:30 P.M., A NEW ROUND OF MESSAGES START AT 11:00. I WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN A- A PRINTOUT, WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND TO MOST PEOPLE IF THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ONE. WHEN I LOOKED AT JUSTIN'S TEXT MESSAGES, WHAT I COULD SEE WAS JUSTIN HAD BEEN GETTING TEXT MESSAGES FROM A CERTAIN NUMBER REPEATEDLY FROM 11:00 ON TO 3:00 IN THE MORNING. Narrator: NOW POLICE HAVE TWO PRIORITIES... IDENTIFYING THE PERSON JUSTIN WAS TEXTING AND LOCATING THE DRIVER OF THE ACTION TAXI. THEN SUDDENLY, NEWS OF A CHANCE SIGHTING EARLIER THAT SAME MORNING GIVES THEM AN UNEXPECTED LEAD. IT'S COMMON PRACTICE FOR PATROLMEN IN OUR PARISH THAT, IF WE SEE A VEHICLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT APPEARS TO HAVE PROBLEMS, WE STOP AND CHECK ON IT TO SEE IF THEY NEED ANY HELP. AND DEPUTY BUTLER HAD JUST STARTED HIS SHIFT THAT MORNING, AND HE NOTICED THE VEHICLE, AND HE PULLED UP BEHIND IT. AND AS HE PULLED UP TO IT, HE NOTICED A WHITE MALE WITH A FLASHLIGHT STANDING IN THE DITCH. SIR, YOU ALL RIGHT? EVENIN', OFFICER. I... YEAH, I- I JUST RAN OUT OF GAS. WHAT YOU DOIN', UH, CRAWLIN' AROUND DOWN THERE? I GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO CALL FOR HELP AND DROPPED MY KEYS, - TRYIN' TO FIND 'EM. - YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU HOP IN? I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT BACK. THAT'S OKAY. I, UH, I GOT SOMEONE COMING, BRINGING MORE GAS, KEYS. IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU, I'D JUST AS SOON WAIT HERE. ALL RIGHT. STAY OFF THE ROAD. Narrator: WHAT'S MORE... WHEN A DESCRIPTION OF THE TAXI IS CIRCULATED ACROSS LAW ENFORCEMENT, SERGEANT KEITH BANTA ALSO RECOGNIZES IT. AND I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD SEEN A TAXICAB THAT MORNING ON MY WAY TO WORK SITTIN' ON THE SIDE OF, UH, YOU KNOW, U.S. HIGHWAY 171. Narrator: SERGEANT BANTA RECALLS THE DRIVER'S STRANGE BEHAVIOR. Banta: AND HE HAD THE STEERING WHEEL IN HIS HANDS, AND HE WAS ROCKING BACK AND FORTH VIOLENTLY, MAKING THE CAR SHAKE. AND AS I PROCEEDED SOUTH, UH, SOMETHING KEPT TELLING ME, "TURN AROUND AND GO BACK. TURN AROUND AND GO BACK." BUT I WAS KIND OF LATE FOR WORK THAT DAY, SO, UH, I DIDN'T TURN AROUND AND GO BACK. AND THE NEXT CALL THAT I GOT WAS, "WE NEED SOME HELP UP IN STONEWALL LOOKING FOR A JUVENILE." I WANTED TO SEE IF THE TAXI WAS STILL THERE. THAT WAS THE MAIN GOAL, WAS TO CHECK AND SEE, WAS IT STILL PARKED AT THAT SCENE? Banta: WHEN THE TAXI WAS MENTIONED, I TOLD MY PARTNER, I SAID, "LET'S... LET'S GO UP HERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS." I GOT... I GOT VERY INTRIGUED. Banta: PULL OVER HERE. AND JUST WALK AHEAD. Narrator: BUT WHEN BANTA RETURNS NEARLY SIX HOURS LATER, THE TAXI IS GONE. Banta: THERE WAS A PILE OF CIGARETTES LAYING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD JUST LIKE THEY THEY'D BEEN... SOMEBODY JUST STOOD THERE AND SMOKED THEM, SMOKED THEM, SMOKED THEM. I STARTED SEEING GRASS THAT WAS LAID DOWN ONE DIRECTION, AND THEN I'D SEE GRASS THAT WAS LAID DOWN ANOTHER. AND ON CLOSER INSPECTION, IT WAS, UH, FOOTPRINTS. IT HAD BEEN TRAVELED SO MUCH, IT LOOKED LIKE A WHOLE HERD OF HOGS HAD BEEN THROUGH THERE. Narrator: BANTA MOVES DEEPER INTO THE WOODS. [ CROW CAWING ] [ CROW CAWING ] I COULD SEE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A PIECE OF TRASH, STYROFOAM, SOMETHING IN THE WATER. AND WHEN I FOCUSED IN ON IT, IT, UH... STARTED OPENING UP TO WHERE I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS BLUE JEANS. I WAS HOPING WHAT I SAW WASN'T WHAT I SAW, BUT I KNEW THAT IT WAS. DEEP DOWN, IT JUST MADE ME SICK. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: POLICE IN STONEWALL, LOUISIANA, HAVE SPENT SEVERAL HOURS SEARCHING FOR MISSING 12-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN BLOXOM. PHONE RECORDS SHOW HE WAS TEXTING SOMEONE AS LATE AS 3:00 A.M., AND THE SIGHTING OF A TAXI CLOSE TO WHERE HE WAS LAST SEEN SUGGESTS HE SNUCK OUT TO MEET SOMEONE. BUT THEN, IN THE WOODS NOT FAR FROM WHERE JUSTIN WAS STAYING AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE, SERGEANT KEITH BANTA MAKES A GRIM DISCOVERY. I'VE BEEN POLICING 26 YEARS, AND I THOUGHT I'D SEEN IT ALL. UH, WHEN IT COMES TO KIDS, UH... THAT ONE WAS TOUGH. THAT WAS TOUGH. YEAH, IT'S ME. YOU NEED TO GET DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY. THAT'S RIGHT. I FOUND HIM. WHEN I SAW JUSTIN, UH, INSTANTLY, I REVERTED TO A FATHER AND I BECAME... UPSET. AND I HAD TO TURN THAT SWITCH BACK ON TO BEING THE PUBLIC SERVANT, BEING THE... THE PEACE OFFICER THAT... THAT I AM. Narrator: LESS THAN FOUR HOURS AFTER THE HUNT FOR JUSTIN BEGAN, DETECTIVE ADAM EWING GETS THE CALL HE'S BEEN DREADING. Ewing: WHEN THAT CALL CAME OUT FOR US TO ALL STOP WHAT WE WERE DOIN' - AND COME TO THEIR LOCATION... - [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] WE KNEW... WE PRETTY MUCH KNEW WHATEVER WAS THERE WAS SERIOUS. THE AUTOPSY REPORT, WHEN IT WAS RECEIVED BACK, UH, FOR THE CAUSE OF DEATH OF, UH, JUSTIN, UH, BLOXOM, UH, RESULTS CAME BACK AS ASPHYXIATION. Narrator: IT'S NOW CLEAR THAT JUSTIN DIDN'T MEET WITH AN ACCIDENT. SOMEBODY MURDERED HIM. AT THIS POINT, WHEN WE FIND JUSTIN DECEASED, THE INVESTIGATION IMMEDIATELY TOOK ON THAT OF A MANHUNT. Narrator: FOR JUSTIN'S MOTHER AMY, WHO WAITED AT HOME WHILE HER FATHER AND BROTHER FORMALLY IDENTIFIED THE BODY, THE NEWS IS SOUL-CRUSHING. [ Voice breaking ] I KIND OF ZOOMED PAST MY DAD'S FACE AND WENT STRAIGHT TO MY BROTHER'S FACE... JOHN... [ SOBS ] THE BIG BROTHER... [ SNIFFLES ] AND HE WAS CRYING. [ CRYING ] AND YOU... YOU'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR BROTHER CRY. YOU KNEW SOMETHING BAD HAD HAPPENED. IT WAS LIKE A KNIFE JUST BEIN'... [ SOBBING ] ...STUCK INTO YOU AND JUST TWISTED AND TWISTED, AND YOU CAN'T STOP THIS PAIN, AND YOU JUST WANT IT TO GO AWAY. I MEAN, IT'S... IT'S A PAIN I HAVE NEVER, EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. IT'S WHAT... LOSIN' A CHILD IS JUST... IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN. IT REALLY IS. [ CONTINUES SOBBING ] NO! NO! Narrator: NOW POLICE MUST FOCUS ON FINDING THE MYSTERY GIRL, AMBER, WHO JUSTIN WAS TEXTING LATE AT NIGHT, AS WELL AS THE TAXI DRIVER. WE HAD NARROWED DOWN THROUGH CALLING THE COMPANY WHO THE DRIVER OF THAT TAXICAB WAS... ...TO BRIAN DOUGLAS HORN. Narrator: A BACKGROUND CHECK REVEALS HORN HAS PRIOR CONVICTIONS FOR SEX OFFENSES. DETECTIVE EWING RECEIVES MORE INFORMATION FROM THE TAXI COMPANY. DURING THE INVESTIGATION THAT DAY, WE HAD RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CAB COMPANY THAT LET US KNOW THAT BRIAN HORN HAD RETURNED THE CAB AND HAD WALKED OFF THE LOT, THAT HE HAD QUIT AND JUST WALKED OFF THE LOT. WHEN THE OFFICERS FROM BOSSIER GOT THERE, THEY PROCESSED THE CAR JUST LIKE A TYPICAL CRIME SCENE. THEY TOOK SWABS FOR D.N.A. THEY DUSTED FOR FINGERPRINTS. THEY DUSTED THE INSIDE. THEY DUSTED THE OUTSIDE. LATENT PRINTS WERE LOCATED ON THE CAR. AT THIS TIME, WE WERE UNABLE TO MATCH THEM TO EITHER THE VICTIM OR THE SUSPECT. Narrator: POLICE DESCEND ON HORN'S PROPERTY. - HELLO? - MRS. HORN? YEAH. UM... YEAH, I GUESS. WHEN THE OFFICERS WENT TO BRIAN HORN'S RESIDENCE, THEY ENCOUNTERED HIS WIFE, AMANDA HORN. AND SHE INFORMED THEM THAT HER AND BRIAN, THEY HAD HAD A SEVERE FIGHT. AND THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SPLIT UP, AND SHE HADN'T SEEN HIM IN A FEW DAYS. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: POLICE RELEASE A PRESS STATEMENT NAMING BRIAN HORN AS A PERSON OF INTEREST IN THE HOMICIDE OF JUSTIN BLOXOM. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO FIND HIM. ESCORTED BY HIS BROTHER KEVIN, BRIAN HORN TURNS UP VOLUNTARILY AT A LOCAL POLICE STATION. MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF BRIAN HORN WAS THAT HE... HE DIDN'T COME OFF AS MENACING. IF YOU WERE TO SEE HIM ON THE STREET, YOU WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT HE WAS TROUBLE. FOR A 30-YEAR-OLD MAN, HE LOOKED MORE LIKE A SCARED CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CAUGHT STEALING. WHY WERE YOU STOPPED ON HIGHWAY 171 LAST NIGHT? IT'S LIKE I TOLD THE OFFICER AT THE TIME. I'D RUN OUT OF GAS AND I'D DROPPED MY KEYS. DID YOU PICK ANYONE UP LAST NIGHT? NO, SIR. DID YOU GO INTO THE WOODS ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE YOUR CAR WAS PARKED? NO. I DROPPED MY KEYS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CAR. I HAD NO REASON TO GO INTO THOSE WOODS. Narrator: KNOWING BRIAN HORN WAS DRIVEN TO THE STATION BY HIS BROTHER KEVIN, DETECTIVE EWING ASKS TO SEE HIS VEHICLE. Ewing: IN THE PROCESS OF THAT, KEVIN HAD POINTED OUT WHAT ITEMS IN THE VEHICLE BRIAN HAD REMOVED FROM THE TAXICAB. AND AS WE WERE GOIN' THROUGH THOSE ITEMS, ON THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE SEAT, WE FOUND AN AT&T S.I.M. CARD. THAT PARTICULAR CARD, I ASKED KEVIN, I SAID, "WHO IS THIS FOR?" AND HE SAID, "THAT'S GONNA BE FOR BRIAN. IT'S NOT FOR ME." WHERE IS YOUR PHONE? MY WIFE TOOK IT. AND THEN WE HAD A BUST UP, AND SHE SMASHED IT UP REAL GOOD, TOO. I AIN'T USED IT SINCE. SO YOU'RE TELLIN' ME YOU HAVE NO PHONE? THAT IS WHAT I AM TELLING YOU, OFFICER. Narrator: TO TRY AND LOCATE BRIAN HORN'S MISSING PHONE, THE POLICE SEARCH HIS HOUSE. THEY ALSO CHECK OUT THE HOME COMPUTER. IT APPEARS BRIAN'S WIFE AMANDA IS AN INTENSE ONLINE USER. THE HARD DRIVE IS PACKED WITH FILES. Ewing: IN THE SEARCH OF THE COMPUTER, WE FOUND A FOLDER CALLED "MANDYBUG." AND IN SEARCHING THAT FOLDER, WE FOUND KNOWN CHILD PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES. Narrator: MEANWHILE BRIAN HORN WAS STILL BEING QUESTIONED AT THE LOCAL POLICE STATION. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GOT WITNESSES, YOU SAY YOU WERE NOT THERE? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I WAS TIRED, LOST. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHERE I WAS. I AIN'T DONE NOTHIN' WRONG. HE WAS CRYING A LOT, AND I SAT DOWN AND ASKED HIM TO TELL ME... [ SNIFFLES ] YOU KNOW, WHAT... WHAT HAPPENED? AND HE WOULDN'T... HE WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. HE WOULD JUST SHAKE HIS HEAD BACK AND FORTH LIKE, "NOTHING. NOTHING." Narrator: THERE'S NO HARD FORENSIC EVIDENCE LINKING HORN TO THE MURDER, BUT IMAGES OF CHILD ABUSE AND PEOPLE BEING SMOTHERED HAVE BEEN FOUND ON A LAPTOP IN HIS HOME. HOWEVER, THE COMPUTER BELONG TO HIS WIFE AMANDA, AND POLICE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND ANOTHER KEY PIECE OF THE PUZZLE... AMBER, WHO JUSTIN WAS TEXTING THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED. POLICE USE THE CONTENT OF JUSTIN'S TEXT MESSAGES TO PUT TOGETHER THE LAST FEW HOURS OF THE BOY'S LIFE. THE TEXT MESSAGES THAT WE SAW FROM JUSTIN'S PHONE WAS THAT THE CONVERSATION STARTED OUT VERY BASIC. JUST, "HOW ARE YOU DOING? WHO ARE YOU? HOW'D YOU GET MY NUMBER?" Narrator: ALTHOUGH JUSTIN DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE NUMBER, HE STILL REPLIES. Ewing: THE... THE PERSON SENDING THE TEXT WAS SOMEONE REFERRING TO THEMSELVES AS AMBER. FROM 11:00 ON TO 3:00 IN THE MORNING, JUSTIN'S PHONE AND THIS OTHER PHONE NUMBER WAS JUST EXCHANGING TEXTS AND IMAGES CONSTANTLY, NONSTOP. Narrator: AT FIRST, THE CONVERSATION IS INNOCENT ENOUGH, BUT IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE AMBER STARTS SENDING INCREASINGLY EXPLICIT MESSAGES. WHAT I COULD SEE FROM THE MESSAGES ON JUSTIN'S PHONE WAS THAT THE PERSON TEXTING HIM, IT STARTED OUT REALLY SLOW AND NORMAL CONVERSATION, AND THEN GEARED TOWARD SEXUAL NATURE, SEX, HAVING SEX AND EVEN DOWN TO THE STRUGGLE IT WAS TO GET JUSTIN TO ACTUALLY COMMIT TO COMING AND MEETING THIS PERSON. Narrator: AMBER TELLS JUSTIN SHE'S BORROWED A CAR AND WILL DRIVE OVER TO HIS HOUSE. AMBER TEXTS TO SAY SHE'S WAITING FOR HIM NEARBY. Ewing: IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TUG-OF-WAR TO GET HIM TO DO THIS. AT SOME POINTS, JUSTIN WOULD GIVE UP. HE WOULD QUIT. AND OTHER POINTS, THIS PERSON WOULD JUST KEEP PUSHING AND KEEP PUSHING. Narrator: FINALLY, CLAIMING SHE CAN'T FIND JUSTIN, AMBER SAYS SHE'LL SEND A TAXI TO PICK HIM UP. TO REASSURE HIM, AMBER TELLS JUSTIN THE NAME OF THE CAB DRIVER IS CHAD. THIS PERSON SENDS IMAGES TO JUSTIN, AND IT'S IMAGES THAT WE FOUND OUT WERE SEXUAL IN NATURE. AND JUSTIN HAS TO REMIND THIS PERSON, "YOU KNOW I'M ONLY 12 YEARS OLD." THERE WAS A LOT OF INAPPROPRIATE THINGS... ...BEING SENT TO JUSTIN IN THOSE TEXT MESSAGES. UM... THERE WERE PARTS OF ME THAT WERE ANGRY AT JUSTIN FOR NOT SEEING THROUGH SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WAS BEING SENT TO HIM. THE DEPUTY TOLD ME, "AMY, HE'S 12. "WHERE YOU AND I AS ADULTS CAN SEE "THAT SOMEONE'S BEING MANIPULATED, "A 12-YEAR-OLD'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO... "TO SEE AS MUCH AS WE CAN. THEY'RE MORE TRUSTING THAN WE ARE." Narrator: JUST BEFORE 3:00 A.M., JUSTIN SNEAKS OUT OF THE HOUSE AGAIN TO WAIT FOR CHAD'S TAXI. Amy: THERE'S THIS PART WHERE IT'S LIKE, "SON, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST REALLY THINK?" YOU KNOW? "COULDN'T YOU JUST THINK?" HE DIDN'T FEEL THE DANGER. HE WAS GOING TO MEET THIS YOUNG GIRL, AND A TAXI WAS COMIN' TO PICK HIM UP. CHAD? Narrator: FOUR HOURS AFTER RECEIVING THE FIRST TEXT MESSAGE FROM AMBER, JUSTIN IS PICKED UP BY THE TAXI. BACK AT THE CRIME SCENE OFF HIGHWAY 171, A FORENSICS TEAM CONTINUES SEARCHING FOR EVIDENCE. Banta: ONE OF THE STONEWALL OFFICERS HAD A METAL DETECTOR IN THE WORKING AREA, AND HE GOT A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL HIT. GOT A KEY. AND WHEN WE LOOKED DOWN, WE MOVED A LEAF. AND THERE WAS THE KEY, VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A SHOE THAT BELONGED TO JUSTIN. SO, UH, THAT VISION OF THE CASE WAS JUST BUILDING AT THAT POINT. WHEN WE FOUND THAT KEY, I KNEW IT. I KNEW THAT IT BELONGED TO THAT CAB, AND IT WAS AN ELATION. THIS CASE JUST WENT FROM ZERO TO A HUNDRED IN NO TIME FLAT. Narrator: POLICE IN STONEWALL, LOUISIANA, ARE HOLDING TAXI DRIVER BRIAN HORN IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF JUSTIN BLOXOM. AT THE CRIME SCENE, A CAR KEY IS FOUND. THEY TRY THE KEY IN HORN'S CAB. AND IT WAS THE EXACT MATCH TO THE CAB - THAT BRIAN HORN WAS OPERATING. - [ ENGINE STARTS ] Narrator: WITH THE KEY LINKING HORN DIRECTLY TO THE CRIME SCENE, IT MAY EXPLAIN HIS VIOLENT BEHAVIOR WITNESSED BY SERGEANT BANTA THAT MORNING. WHEN DETECTIVE EWING REVEALS THE KEY'S BEEN FOUND, HORN REFUSES TO COOPERATE ANY LONGER. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH MY ATTORNEY. Narrator: THERE'S STILL ONE MORE PERSON POLICE NEED TO TRACK DOWN... AMBER. THE LAST KNOWN TIME FRAME OF WHEN JUSTIN WAS PHYSICALLY ALIVE AT THAT POINT, UM, THAT WE WOULD KNOW OF OR LAST HEARD OF, UH, WAS BASED ON THAT TEXT MESSAGE TO AMBER. SO, OF COURSE, WE'RE GONNA GO AND GRAB AMBER AND FIND OUT, "DID YOU SEE JUSTIN THAT NIGHT? DID YOU TALK TO JUSTIN, PERSON TO PERSON?" Narrator: TURNS OUT THE KEY TO AMBER'S IDENTITY IS ALREADY IN THE HANDS OF POLICE. THE NUMBER THAT SUPPOSEDLY BELONGED TO AMBER MATCHED THE S.I.M. CARD THAT WE HAD RECOVERED THAT WAS IN POSSESSION OF BRIAN. GOTCHA, YOU LYIN' SCUMBAG. Ewing: BRIAN WAS AMBER. THERE WAS NEVER A SECOND PARTY. Narrator: ON MARCH 31, 2010, BRIAN HORN IS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. LOOKING AT HIM AND WONDERING HOW A HUMAN BEING COULD... COULD TAKE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, ESPECIALLY A CHILD. I NEEDED TO KNOW MORE. Narrator: BRIAN HORN HAS BEEN USING HIS WIFE'S ONLINE IDENTITY AS BAIT FOR SEX WITH STRANGERS, AND IT WAS HORN WHO DOWNLOADED THE IMAGES OF CHILD ABUSE. IT'S THE SAME THING, IN ESSENCE, THAT HE DID TO JUSTIN, WAS POSING AS A WOMAN OR A GIRL TO LURE JUSTIN IN. IT JUST SHOWS HE HAD A PAST HISTORY OF DOING THAT, POSING AS HIS WIFE TO MEET UP WITH COUPLES ON CRAIGSLIST. Narrator: WITH HORN IN JAIL, DETECTIVE EWING CONTINUES TO HUNT FOR SOLID EVIDENCE TO PROVE JUSTIN WAS IN HIS TAXI. Ewing: I TOOK THEM TO A SECOND EXAMINER. I TOOK THE PRINTS THAT WERE LIFTED AT THE SCENE, THE FINGERPRINT CARD, AND ALSO THE AUTOPSY PRINTS. AND THAT EXAMINER WAS ABLE TO MATCH THE PRINTS FROM THE WINDOW OF THE TAXICAB TO JUSTIN. IT TOLD US THAT JUSTIN WAS IN THAT TAXICAB OR AT THE TAXICAB BECAUSE THE PRINTS WERE LIFTED FROM THE OUTSIDE PASSENGER WINDOW. Narrator: WITH PROOF OF KIDNAPPING, THE CHARGE AGAINST HORN IS ELEVATED TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. DURING HIS TRIAL, IT'S REVEALED THAT HORN OBTAINED JUSTIN'S NUMBER AFTER HE DOWNLOADED A CONTACT LIST FROM A FRIEND OF HIS STEPDAUGHTER'S CELL PHONE. THE TEXT RECORDS SHOW THAT HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW OLD JUSTIN WAS. THE JURY TAKES LESS THAN AN HOUR TO FIND HORN GUILTY. HE IS SENTENCED TO DEATH. I REALLY DIDN'T TAKE ANY SENSE OF VICTORY AWAY FROM IT FOR MYSELF BECAUSE... JUSTIN WAS DECEASED, AND I COULDN'T BRING HIM BACK. Narrator: BRIAN HORN HAS NEVER REVEALED WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE CAB THAT NIGHT. POLICE CAN ONLY SPECULATE. THE LAST TEXT THAT JUSTIN... THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIN SENT WITH THE PHONE WAS AT 3:15. "THE CAR JUST DIED." THIS IS A TEXT THAT HE SENT TO WHO HE THOUGHT WAS AMBER. AT THAT POINT, IF THE PHONE WENT OFF IN BRIAN'S POCKET... [ CELL PHONE CHIMES AND VIBRATES ] ...WOULD JUSTIN HAVE BEEN QUICK ENOUGH OR SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT BRIAN HORN WAS INDEED AMBER? I CAN ONLY WONDER WHAT THAT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE. YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT YOURSELF IN YOUR CHILD'S PLACE... [ Voice breaking ] ...TO WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T THERE TO PROTECT HIM. AND YOU'RE CONSTANT... YOU'VE GOT THIS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND. WAS YOUR CHILD SCREAMING FOR YOU LIKE THEY DO WHEN THEY CUT THEMSELVES OR THEY HURT THEMSELVES? AND THEY'RE CRYING OUT FOR MOM TO COME HELP. AND YOU... SO YOU'RE TRYING TO GO, "HOW LONG DID JUSTIN HAVE TO FEAR..." "...BEFORE HE LOST HIS LIFE? "AND WAS HE SCREAMING FOR ME, AND I COULDN'T BE THERE TO HELP HIM?" THE PROSECUTION OF BRIAN HORN RESULTS IN THE PASSING OF THE BLOXOM BILL, BANNING CONVICTED SEX OFFENDERS FROM DRIVING TAXIS, LIMOUSINES, AND BUSES. IT'S NOW LAW IN LOUISIANA, OKLAHOMA, AND TEXAS. EVERY DAY, I WANT JUSTIN STILL... I STILL WANT HIM HOME WITH ME. I MISS THAT SMILE. I MISS THAT LAUGH. I MISS THAT GOOFINESS IN HIM. I MISS HIM DANCING. [ Voice breaks ] I- I MISS ALL THE FOOTBALL GAMES. I MISS IT ALL. I MISS MY LIFE THAT I HAD.
