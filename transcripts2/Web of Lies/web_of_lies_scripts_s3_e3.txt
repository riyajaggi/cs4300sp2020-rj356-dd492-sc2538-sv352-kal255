 Philipson: EVERYTHING THAT LACEY HAD BEEN TELLING ME, IT WAS SHOCKING. Narrator: ...UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY. IT WAS THE WORST THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. Narrator: 19-YEAR-OLD LACEY SPEARS LIVES IN THE HEART OF THE BIBLE BELT, IN DECATUR, ALABAMA. SHE GOES BY THE NICKNAME LACEYBUG. THE FIRST TIME I MET LACEY WAS AT A DAY CARE. MY KIDS STARTED GOING THERE, AND SHE WAS A WORKER THERE. HI, LITTLE BUDDY. LACEY HAD A SWEET PERSONALITY. HOW WAS YOUR DAY TODAY? HE WAS VERY GOOD.

 WE JUST KINDA GOT EACH OTHER AND WE KINDA CLICKED. Lacey: LOOK AT YOU! Narrator: AFTER WORK, LACEY'S APARTMENT BECOMES A REGULAR HANG-OUT FOR SHAWNA AND HER TWO SONS. I'M GONNA TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU WITH THOSE SQUIRRELS. OH, THAT LOOKS SO NICE. SHE TOOK CARE OF MY KIDS. MY KIDS ADORED HER, AND THEY HAD FUN WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS THERE. ALL RIGHT, GO PLAY. GOD, LACEY, YOU'RE MORE LIKE A MOTHER THAN A BABYSITTER. LACEY DID TALK TO ME ABOUT WANTING TO HAVE A BABY. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT SHE REALLY WANTED. Narrator: BUT LACEY SEEMS TO WANT TO SPEND ALL HER TIME WITH SHAWNA AND HER KIDS, INSTEAD OF FINDING SOMEONE TO SETTLE DOWN WITH. SHAWNA STARTS TO SENSE THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG. MORNING! Lynch: IT HAD JUST GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS STAYING AT MY HOUSE A LOT AT NIGHT. WHEN I ASKED HER IF SHE WAS GONNA GO HOME, SHE WOULD GET KINDA SCARED AND BE LIKE, "NO, I'M JUST GONNA STAY HERE." I WAS JUST WORRIED THAT MAYBE SOMETHING WAS GOING ON? NO, I -- I'M FINE. ARE YOU SURE? IT'S JUST -- LISTEN. I'M LIKE, "YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PLACE, BUT YOU WANT TO STAY HERE. YOU KNOW, SEVERAL, THREE OR FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING ON?" IF I'M OVERSTAYING MY WELCOME... I'LL GO. - NO, LACEY, PLEASE. - NO, IT'S FINE. I'LL JUST GET MY THINGS AND GO. SHE JUST JUMPED ON THE DEFENSIVE, GOT VERY UPSET. SO I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON. BUT I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT IT. Narrator: NOT LONG AFTER, LACEY REACHES OUT TO SHAWNA WITH SOME SURPRISING NEWS. SHE SENDS SHAWNA A PHOTO FROM AN ULTRASOUND. OH, MY... [ RINGING ] LACEY? YEAH, IT'S ME. I KNEW IT! OF COURSE, I WAS HAPPY FOR HER, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT'S WHAT SHE HAD WANTED. THANKS. IT'S NICE TO FINALLY SAY IT OUT LOUD. TELL ME THE WHOLE STORY. Narrator: LACEY IS HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT HER BABY. BUT THERE'S ONE THING SHE WON'T TALK ABOUT. I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT WHO THE DAD WAS. BUT SHE NEVER COMMENTED ON IT OR SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SO I FELT LIKE IT REALLY WASN'T ANY OF MY BUSINESS. Narrator: GARNETT-PAUL THOMPSON SPEARS IS BORN AT DECATUR HOSPITAL ON DECEMBER 3rd, 2008. HE'S A HEALTHY 6 POUNDS, 13 OUNCES. [ BABY CRIES ] HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE LISTS HIS FATHER AS UNKNOWN. SHE WAS OVER THE MOON WHEN SHE HAD GARNETT. Narrator: BUT STRANGELY, HER JOY QUICKLY FADES WHEN HER PARENTS ARRIVE. Lynch: THE TIMES THAT I WAS WITH LACEY WHEN SHE WAS AROUND HER FAMILY, YOU COULD TELL THERE WAS SOMETHING A LITTLE OFF WITH THEM. SHE WAS KINDA STANDOFFISH, YOU KNOW. Narrator: LACEY DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT HER PARENTS' HELP WITH GARNETT. LACEY SEEMED FINE WITH BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF A CHILD AS A SINGLE MOM. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. [ BABY CRIES ] Narrator: BUT SOON ENOUGH, LACEY FINDS SINGLE MOTHERHOOD TOUGH. GARNETT'S NOT EATING, AND HE'S NOT PUTTING ON WEIGHT. DESPERATE FOR SUPPORT, SHE TURNS TO THE INTERNET. PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS OFFERING ADVICE TO LACEY THROUGH HER FACEBOOK POSTS. I MEAN, SHE WOULD POST QUESTIONS, AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD FLOOD HER POSTS. YOU KNOW, ANYTHING THAT WOULD HELP HER OUT WITH ANYTHING THAT SHE POSTED. Narrator: DESPITE RECEIVING A TON OF ADVICE, GARNETT DOESN'T IMPROVE. ANYTHING LACEY MANAGES TO GET HIM TO SWALLOW, COMES RIGHT BACK UP. POOR BABY. AT 4 MONTHS, LACEY'S SON IS IN CONSTANT DISTRESS. [ BABY CRIES ] HE KEEPS CRYING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. A DOCTOR DIAGNOSIS GARNETT WITH FAILURE TO THRIVE AND ORDERS SURGERY THAT WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO VOMIT. Lynch: I FELT HORRIBLE FOR LACEY THAT SHE WAS HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, I FELT HORRIBLE FOR GARNETT THAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT MUCH PAIN AND -- AND, YOU KNOW, ALL THE ISSUES THAT HE HAD. Narrator: THE MONTHS PASSED, BUT GARNETT STILL ISN'T GAINING WEIGHT. DOCTORS DECIDE TO TAKE A DRASTIC STEP TO MAKE SURE HE ABSORBS FOOD. THEY INSERT A FEEDING TUBE THROUGH HIS ABDOMEN. [ BABY CRIES ] AS HER SON STARTS HIS LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY, LACEY DOCUMENTS EVERY MOMENT ONLINE. NOTHING IS TOO PERSONAL. Lynch: YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE LOOKING ON YOUR FACEBOOK AND SEEING A BABY SPRAWLED OUT ON A BED. THAT'S JUST HARD TO LOOK AT. I JUST DON'T THINK I WOULD'VE POSTED IF THAT WAS MY SON. BUT IF THAT'S WHAT SHE FELT LIKE SHE NEEDED TO DO TO GET THE SUPPORT THAT SHE NEEDED THEN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT SHE COULD DO. [ CRIES ] Narrator: IN SEARCH OF AN EVEN LARGER SUPPORT NETWORK, LACEY JOINS ONLINE FORUMS FOR MOTHERS WITH SICK CHILDREN. MESSAGES OF ENCOURAGEMENT POUR IN. THE NEW FEEDING TUBE MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. GARNETT STILL ISN'T THRIVING. OVER THE NEXT YEAR, LACEY GOES FROM DOCTOR TO DOCTOR AND CONTINUES TO RECORD HER STRUGGLE ONLINE. LACEY ALWAYS HAD A BRAVE FACE ON HER. YOU KNOW, SHE SAID THEY WOULD GET THROUGH THIS AND THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD MAKE THE BEST OUT OF IT AND DO WHAT SHE HAD TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF HER SON. Narrator: ULTIMATELY, DESPITE ALL OF THE ONLINE SUPPORT, LACEY CAN'T COPE. SHE DECIDES SHE HAS TO GET OUT OF ALABAMA. LACEY TOLD ME THE REASON THAT SHE WAS MOVING TO FLORIDA WAS TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE FOR GARNETT. SHE SAID THE WEATHER THERE WAS BETTER AND THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER OFF THERE. LACEY AND 2-YEAR-OLD GARNETT MOVE IN WITH LACEY'S GRANDMOTHER, PEGGY, IN SUNNY CLEARWATER, FLORIDA. PEGGY IS GLAD TO HAVE THEM THERE. AND FOR LACEY, AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. SWEETIE PIE! WHO'S THAT LITTLE CUTIE? THIS IS MY GRANDSON. Narrator: SOON LACEY, MAKES FRIENDS WITH THE NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET. KIM, THIS IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER, LACEY. HI, I'M KIM. SO NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SON. ISN'T HE LOVELY? Philipson: FIRST DAY I MET LACEY, I COULD TELL SHE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER SON. JUST DOTED OVER HIM AND SEEMED REALLY HAPPY LIVING IN FLORIDA. Narrator: INSPIRED BY HER NEW SURROUNDINGS, LACEY STARTS A BLOG TO SHARE HER SON'S PROGRESS. SHE CALLS IT "GARNETT'S JOURNEY." AND IT'S NOT JUST HIS MEDICAL PROBLEMS SHE BLOGS ABOUT. LACEY DIDN'T SPEAK AT ALL ABOUT WHO GARNETT'S FATHER WAS. I JUST FIGURED SHE'S A SINGLE MOTHER. Narrator: SHE KNOWS SHE CAN'T AVOID TELLING HER SON WHO HIS FATHER IS FOREVER. GARNETT STILL HAS HEALTH PROBLEMS, BUT DESPITE THIS, LACEY'S HAPPIER IN CLEARWATER THAN SHE'S EVER BEEN. ALL THAT CHANGES WHEN HER PARENTS COME FOR A VISIT. Man: HEY, LACEYBUG. Philipson: LACEY'S FATHER WOULD COME TO CLEARWATER AND STAY. WHEN HE DID, LACEY WOULD JUST HIDE IN THE HOUSE. I WOULDN'T SEE HER DURING THE TIME HER DAD WAS THERE. HE WAS ALL OVER GARNETT. PLAYED AND PLAYED WITH GARNETT OUTSIDE, WHILE LACEY WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. IT JUST STRUCK ME AS VERY ODD. Narrator: A FEW WEEKS LATER, KIM NOTICES LACEY IS EXTREMELY ANXIOUS. SHE WONDERS IF IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANOTHER UPCOMING VISIT FROM HER PARENTS? Philipson: I COULD TELL SOMETHING WAS WRONG. AND THEN THE DAY CAME WHEN SHE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET. HEY, ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT IS IT, WHAT'S GOING ON? SHE LOOKED REALLY BESIDE HERSELF. VERY UPSET. AND THAT'S WHEN SHE OPENED UP AND SAID... IT'S MY DAD. HE'S ABUSING YOU, ISN'T HE? YES. SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED, FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND IT WAS STILL GOING ON. AND IT GETS WORSE. AND THAT'S WHEN THE SECOND SHOCK CAME. YOU HAVE TO PROMISE NOT TO JUDGE ME, OKAY? OF COURSE, I PROMISE. SHE SAID GARNETT'S FATHER WAS... HER OWN FATHER. Narrator: SINGLE MOTHER LACEY SPEARS AND HER 2-YEAR-OLD SON, GARNETT, HAVE MOVED FROM ALABAMA TO FLORIDA SO THEY CAN LIVE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER, PEGGY. LACEY HAS JUST TOLD HER NEIGHBOR, KIM, A TERRIBLE SECRET ABOUT HER OWN FATHER. HE'S GARNETT'S DAD. OH, GOD. AT THAT MOMENT, I FELT SO SICK AND I FELT SO SORRY FOR GARNETT. IT WAS SO DISGUSTING. I JUST WANTED TO PROTECT HIM. AND... IT KIND OF EXPLAINED PROBABLY HIS MEDICAL CONDITIONS. DOES YOUR MOM KNOW? YES. I TOLD LACEY I'LL DO ANYTHING TO HELP HER. I'LL MAKE THE POLICE REPORT. I'LL TAKE GARNETT TO THE DOCTOR -- WHATEVER I COULD DO. AND LACEY SAID, "NO, NO YOU CAN'T TELL. YOU CAN'T TELL." YOU PROMISED. YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY, ALL RIGHT? IT'S NOT GARNETT'S FAULT. Narrator: SWORN TO SECRECY, KIM FINDS HERSELF IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION. Philipson: LACEY'S FATHER JUST CAME AND WENT. MAYBE EVERY TWO OR THREE WEEKS, HE WOULD STAY FOR A COUPLE DAYS. IT WAS HORRIFIC. - KIM. - ARE YOU OKAY? HOW ARE YOU? I'M NOT OKAY. CAN I STAY WITH YOU? WHEN LACEY'S FATHER WAS VISITING AGAIN LACEY WAS EXTREMELY UPSET. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON? LAST TIME THEY WERE HERE, I I-I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU, BUT I GOT PREGNANT. AND I -- I -- I HAD A MISCARRIAGE. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. NO, KIM, YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING. NO, I'M STOPPING THIS. NO, PLEASE, STOP! DON'T GO! I FELT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP HER. I CONFRONTED LACEY'S MOM. I JUST BENT DOWN AND I SAID, "YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR ASS BACK TO ALABAMA WHERE YOU BELONG." AND TELL YOUR HUSBAND TO NEVER COME HERE AGAIN OR I WILL CALL THE POLICE! OH! OH! MA, SHE'S THREATENING ME! SHE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET. PLEASE, KIM, YOU HAVE TO APOLOGIZE, OR MY GRANDMA WILL SEND US BACK TO ALABAMA. PLEASE, PLEASE! [ SIGHS ] SHE SAID, "PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE OTHERWISE I WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY HERE." Narrator: KIM CAN SEE LACEY IS TERRIFIED, BUT SHE'S COME TOO FAR TO STOP NOW. LOOK, PEGGY, I AM SORRY I UPSET YOUR DAUGHTER. BUT THERE ARE THINGS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WAIT. JUST -- IT -- IT -- NO. STOP. OKAY? JUST STOP. Philipson: LACEY WAS LOOKING AT ME JUST SHAKING HER HEAD THINKING, "DON'T SAY ANYTHING. DON'T SAY ANYTHING." AT THIS POINT, I -- I KNEW MS. PEGGY NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING. LOOK, LACEY'S FATHER ABUSED HER. - NO. - HE RAPED HER. NO! NO! - HE GOT HER PREGNANT. - IT'S NOT TRUE. SHE MISCARRIED IN YOUR OWN HOME, PEGGY! LISTEN! YOU LISTEN TO ME! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING, OKAY? - LOOK... - NO, STOP. OKAY? JUST STOP. SHE WASN'T GONNA HEAR OF IT, ABSOLUTELY NOT. Narrator: PEGGY TELLS KIM SHE WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT GO TO THE POLICE ABOUT LACEY'S DAD. Philipson: THAT WAS THE END OF ANY CONTACT WITH LACEY AND LACEY'S FAMILY. IT WAS THE END. I HAD HAD ENOUGH. Narrator: OVER THE NEXT YEAR, LACEY'S DAD CONTINUES TO PAY REGULAR VISITS TO HIS DAUGHTER. LACEY ONCE AGAIN TURNS TO THE INTERNET, THIS TIME ON A DESPERATE SEARCH FOR A NEW PLACE TO LIVE. IT TAKES MONTHS TO FIND WHAT SHE'S LOOKING FOR, BUT IN THE FALL OF 2012, SHE HAS A STROKE OF LUCK. IT'S A LIVE-IN JOB OFFER. AND THE BEST PART IS THAT IT'S 900 MILES AWAY IN NEW YORK STATE. IT SEEMS LIKE THE ANSWER TO ALL HER PRAYERS. A FEW WEEKS BEFORE GARNETT'S FOURTH BIRTHDAY, LACEY SETS OFF FOR CHESTNUT RIDGE, NEW YORK, EAGER TO START A NEW LIFE AND LEAVE HER OLD ONE BEHIND. THEY'RE HEADED FOR THE FELLOWSHIP, AN ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE COMMUNITY CARING FOR THE ELDERLY AND VULNERABLE. AS SOON AS LACEY LEADS GARNETT UP THE PATH, SHE'S CONVINCED SHE'S FOUND THE RIGHT PLACE. LONG-TIME RESIDENT VALERIE JOHNSON WELCOMES THEM. SO NICE TO MEET YOU, LACEY. O'Brien: VALERIE WAS FRIENDLY WITH LACEY. I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL THEM FRIENDS SO MUCH AS I WOULD SAY VALERIE'S MORE FRIENDS WITH GARNETT. GARNETT, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU. GREAT TO HAVE SOME LIFE AROUND HERE. I THINK THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT PROBABLY ATTRACTED LACEY TO THE FELLOWSHIP. IT'S ISOLATED FROM THE OUTSIDE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL. AND IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO HIDE FROM WHATEVER YOU'RE HIDING FROM. Narrator: LACEY AND GARNETT FOLLOW VALERIE TO A LARGE APARTMENT IN A BUILDING CALLED TULIP HOUSE. SO THIS WILL BE YOUR PLACE. OH, IT'S GREAT! OH, HOW DO -- THERE'S -- THERE'S NO LOCKS. OH, NO. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN LOCKS HERE. BUT YOU'LL GET USED TO IT. NOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE GARNETT FEEL AT HOME? HOW ABOUT SOME HOMEMADE ICE CREAM? IN THE COMMUNITY, THERE'S VERY LITTLE PRIVACY. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A HOME. YOU HAVE A ROOM. BUT YOU CAN'T LOCK YOUR HOUSE. INHALE, UP. Narrator: THE FELLOWSHIP MAY BE STRANGE, BUT LACEY AND GARNETT DIVE IN HEAD-FIRST. AND THEY SETTLE IN QUICKLY. BEAUTIFUL. THERE WAS POSTS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN. YOU KNOW, JUST ABOUT THE WAY OF LIFE THAT THEY WERE TRAVELING DOWN NOW. AND SHE SEEMED TO BE HAVING A GOOD TIME. EVERYBODY LOOKED AFTER GARNETT 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO SPENT MORE TIME WITH GARNETT THAN OTHERS. VALERIE, OF COURSE, WOULD BE ONE OF THEM. AND GARNETT, JUST BEING THAT HAPPY KID, WAS KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE CHICK IN THE HENHOUSE. Narrator: BUT AS HAPPY AS LACEY AND GARNETT ARE AT THE FELLOWSHIP, GARNETT IS STILL PLAGUED BY THE MYSTERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS HE'S HAD SINCE BIRTH. YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, BUDDY? INFLUENCED BY HER NEW FRIENDS, LACEY DECIDES TRADITIONAL MEDICINE HAS FAILED HER SON AND MAYBE HOLISTIC MEDICINE CAN HELP INSTEAD. AS SHE TELLS HER ONLINE FRIENDS, THE NEW HOMEOPATHIC APPROACH SEEMS TO BE WORKING. BUT GARNETT'S IMPROVED HEALTH WILL BE SHORT-LIVED. JUST WEEKS AFTER HIS FIFTH BIRTHDAY... [ SIREN WAILS ] HE HAS A SEIZURE AND IS RUSHED TO NYACK HOSPITAL. THE CAUSE OF HIS ATTACK WILL ROCK THIS COMMUNITY TO ITS CORE. Narrator: FIVE-YEAR-OLD GARNETT SPEARS HAS BEEN RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER A SEIZURE. [ MONITORS BEEPING ] DOCTORS HOOK HIM UP TO AN EEG, THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF TESTS THEY HOPE WILL EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSED THE ATTACK. LACEY'S UPDATES ABOUT HER SON ON FACEBOOK ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY MATTER-OF-FACT AND HORRIFYING. Lynch: EVERY TIME LACEY WOULD POST SOMETHING ABOUT GARNETT, I WOULD POST IT ON MY NEWS FEED AND SAY, YOU KNOW, "THIS FAMILY NEEDS A PRAYER RIGHT NOW." Narrator: PRAYERS POUR IN. AND WHEN FRIENDS FROM THE FELLOWSHIP VISIT THE NEXT DAY, THEY ARE RELIEVED BY WHAT THEY FIND. HI, GARNETT! IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU! YOU'RE LOOKING REALLY GOOD! PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED AT HOW WELL GARNETT SEEMED TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL. JOHN AND MATT ARE OUTSIDE. OH, I'LL GO SAY, "HELLO." ALL RIGHT. THE PEOPLE WHO SAW HIM JUST THOUGHT HE WOULD BE BACK HOME. HOW'S MY MINT-CHOCOLATE-CHIP BOY? READY FOR SOME SPRINKLES ON TOP THIS TIME? Narrator: DOCTORS ARE ENCOURAGED BY GARNETT'S IMPROVEMENT AND CAN FIND NO OBVIOUS CAUSE OF THE SEIZURE. THEY TELL HIS MOTHER THEY PLAN TO RELEASE HIM THAT DAY. NO, NO. HE SEEMS FINE NOW, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S NOT OKAY. LACEY IS ADAMANT THAT THE DOCTORS HAVE MISSED SOMETHING. YOU NEED TO HELP HIM! DON'T LEAVE! ALL TOO SOON, THE DOCTORS WILL REALIZE LACEY'S RIGHT. GARNETT DOES NEED THEIR HELP, URGENTLY. [ ALARM RINGING ] GARNETT, ARE YOU OKAY? I TOLD YOU. I TOLD YOU! HE'S NOT ALL RIGHT, HELP HIM! PLEASE HELP HIM. PLEASE, DO WHATEVER! Narrator: GARNETT STOPS BREATHING. HE IS AIRLIFTED TO A SPECIALIZED INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN VALHALLA, NEW YORK, HIS MOTHER BY HIS SIDE. GARNETT IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. BUT AS DOCTORS TRY TO STABILIZE HIM, THEY STILL HAVE NO DIAGNOSIS OF HIS NOW LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESS. THEY DECIDE THEY HAVE TO CALL IN THE POLICE. DOCTOR CANTER? DETECTIVE CARFI WITH THE WESTCHESTER POLICE DEPARTMENT. Carfi: DOCTOR CANTER ADVISED THAT THE CHILD IN QUESTION, GARNETT SPEARS, HAD SUFFERED A MAJOR BRAIN TRAUMA AND WAS CURRENTLY ON LIFE SUPPORT. Narrator: DOCTOR CANTER TELLS DETECTIVE DAN CARFI THAT SHE BELIEVES GARNETT'S CONDITION IS TIED TO A SPIKE IN HIS SODIUM LEVELS. SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF SODIUM IN THIS CHILD. WHAT SHE WAS SAYING TO ME IS THAT THIS KID WAS POISONED. I WALKED BY THE CHILD'S ROOM. AND I SAW GARNETT WAS HOOKED TO LIFE SUPPORT. AT THAT TIME, I INTRODUCED MYSELF TO LACEY AND ASKED HER IF SHE HAD A FEW MOMENTS TO TALK. EXCUSE ME, LACEY. DETECTIVE CARFI, WESTCHESTER PD. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? LACEY APPEARED TO BE UPSET AND REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER SON. MIND ME ASKING, HAVE YOU BEEN GIVING HIM ANY MEDICATIONS AT ALL? LACEY STATED THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY, IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO, GOT INTO HOLISTIC MEDICINES THAT SHE LEARNED FROM A DOCTOR FROM THE FELLOWSHIP. GOD, DO YOU THINK THAT ONE OF THE MEDICATIONS COULD'VE CAUSED THIS? I COULD GIVE YOU A LIST IF YOU'D LIKE. THAT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING INTO EVERY POSSIBILITY RIGHT NOW. Narrator: THAT NIGHT, GARNETT IS STILL STRUGGLING ON HIS RESPIRATOR. DETECTIVE CARFI IS JOINED AT THE HOSPITAL BY KIRK BUDNICK AND GREG DUNN, DETECTIVES FROM THE RAMAPO POLICE DEPARTMENT. TOGETHER, THEY NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND GARNETT'S MYSTERIOUS COLLAPSE. Carfi: WE STARTED GOING OVER WHAT WE HAD. DO WE HAVE A MEDICAL MALPRACTICE? DO WE HAVE A HOSPITAL THAT MAYBE MIXED UP SOME MEDICATIONS OR HOOKED THE WRONG BAG TO THIS CHILD? DID WE HAVE A MOTHER WHO WAS USING HOLISTIC MEDICINES AND DOESN'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO PREPARE THEM AND CAUSED THIS ACCIDENTLY? DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF ACCIDENT HERE? OR DID SOMEONE INTENTIONALLY POISON THIS CHILD? Narrator: DETECTIVES BUDNICK AND DUNN DECIDE TO SEARCH LACEY'S APARTMENT. Dunn: WE ENTERED INTO THE APARTMENT. THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED. WHEN WE WALKED IN, I FOUND IT VERY ODD THAT NOTHING WAS OUT OF PLACE BECAUSE LACEY HAD LEFT HER HOUSE IN AN EMERGENCY BECAUSE HER SON WAS HAVING A SEIZURE. IT APPEARED THAT THE HOUSE WAS CLEANED UP AND SPOTLESS. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S TOO NEAT. IT'S TOO TIDY. THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT SAID, "THIS IS NOT RIGHT." I THINK I FOUND THE MEDS. THERE WERE OVER 150 HOLISTIC MEDICINES THAT WE RECOVERED ON THAT SEARCH WARRANT. Narrator: THE DETECTIVES GATHER UP ALL OF LACEY'S HOLISTIC MEDICINES AND TAKE THEM TO THE LAB FOR TESTING. AND THEN THEY WAIT. THE NEXT DAY DAWNS WITH TRAGEDY AND LACEY SHARES DEVASTATING NEWS ONLINE. ALL HOPE FOR LITTLE GARNETT'S RECOVERY IS GONE. Lynch: I SAW THE FACEBOOK POST. IT WAS HEARTBREAKING. WHEN YOU READ SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT HURTS YOUR HEART. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A PARENT, YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING TO SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW. Narrator: LACEY NOW FACES EVERY MOTHER'S WORST NIGHTMARE. SHE WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE CALL TO TURN OFF HIS LIFE SUPPORT. AS LACEY AGONIZES, DETECTIVES ARE NO CLOSER TO FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSED GARNETT'S SODIUM LEVELS TO SKYROCKET. LAB RESULTS ON THE ITEMS COLLECTED FROM LACEY'S APARTMENT SHOW NO TRACES OF SODIUM... ...AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT. UNBEKNOWNST TO DETECTIVES, SOMEONE ELSE HAS GOTTEN THERE FIRST. Narrator: DOCTORS SUSPECT THAT SODIUM POISONING CAUSED THE BRAIN DEATH OF 5-YEAR-OLD GARNETT SPEARS, WHO IS NOW ON LIFE SUPPORT. BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF MALPRACTICE AT THE HOSPITAL. AND DETECTIVES HAVE SEARCHED GARNETT'S MOTHER, LACEY'S APARTMENT AND FOUND NO SODIUM IN THE ITEMS THEY COLLECTED. STILL, THE SEASONED INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE SOMEONE IS HIDING SOMETHING... THANK YOU FOR COMING. ...AND DECIDE IT'S TIME TO BRING IN THE ENTIRE SPEARS FAMILY TO GET SOME ANSWERS. NOW, LACEY, I NEED YOU TO THINK REALLY HARD. CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING, OTHER THAN THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE TOLD US ABOUT, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR? THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM HER. WELL, I THOUGHT THAT WAS ODD. AS WE STARTED TO LOOK AT LACEY'S FAMILY, I FELT THE RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD WITH LACEY WAS STRANGE. NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF. OUR GUT FEELING WAS THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG HERE. Narrator: TROUBLED AFTER THE MEETING AND ACTING ON A HUNCH, DETECTIVE CARFI STARTS CALLING PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SPEARS FAMILY TO SEE IF THEY CAN SHED ANY LIGHT ON THEIR BIZARRE BEHAVIOR. HIS HUNCH IS ABOUT TO PAY OFF. MAY I SPEAK TO KIM PHILIPSON, PLEASE? HI, I'M KIM. SO NICE TO MEET YOU. I TOLD THE POLICE EVERYTHING -- WHAT'S GOING ON? IT WAS, UH, QUITE DRAMATIC. ...WHAT SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER DAD... HE'S ABUSING YOU, ISN'T HE? YES. ...ABOUT THE ABUSE... NO, KIM, YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING. ...ABOUT WHO GARNETT'S FATHER WAS... THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. ...HOW I CONFRONTED HER GRANDMOTHER... LACEY'S FATHER ABUSED HER, HE RAPED HER. NO! SHE MISCARRIED IN YOUR OWN HOME, PEGGY! STOP! ...AND HOW SHE LOOKED ME SQUARE IN THE EYE AND SAID... "LACEY HAS A TRUTHFULNESS ISSUE!" AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW, EVERYTHING WAS A LIE. IT WAS -- IT WAS SHOCKING. EVERYTHING THAT LACEY HAS BEEN TELLING ME, ALL OF THE PROTECTION I WAS TRYING TO GIVE HER, ALL OF THE ATTENTION I GAVE HER... EVERYTHING WAS A LIE. I SAID TO MYSELF, "UH OH." IS LACEY INVOLVED IN SOMETHING HERE? NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF. Narrator: FOR DETECTIVE CARFI, ALL BETS ARE OFF. HE KNOWS HE HAS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT LACEY. WAS PEGGY TELLING KIM THE TRUTH ABOUT HER GRANDDAUGHTER? WHAT DETECTIVE CARFI UNCOVERS IS ASTONISHING. Carfi: THE FIRST THING THAT JUMPED OUT TO ME WAS THE FACT THAT SHE HAD THREE DIFFERENT PROFILES ON FACEBOOK. AND THREE DIFFERENT AUDIENCES, ONE FOR EACH PROFILE. IT BECAME READILY APPARENT THAT THE REASON FOR THESE MULTIPLE SITES WAS TO DECEIVE HER AUDIENCES. Budnick: SHE CLAIMED ON THE INTERNET THAT SHE WAS A WET NURSE AND THAT SHE'D DONATED BREAST MILK TO WOMEN THAT COULDN'T GIVE MILK TO THEIR CHILDREN. NOT TRUE. SHE WAS A PARENT WHO HAD LOST A PREVIOUS CHILD... NOT TRUE. SHE HAD A BRAIN INJURY WHEN SHE WAS A CHEERLEADER IN HIGH SCHOOL. NOT TRUE. Dunn: A TERRIBLE BLOOD DISORDER THAT REQUIRED MULTIPLE TRANSFUSIONS. NOT TRUE. Budnick: SHE CLAIMED THAT HER HUSBAND WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT... IN A TERRIBLE MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT. HE WAS A FORMER POLICEMAN HIT BY A CAR. EVERYTHING SHE WAS TELLING WAS A LIE. IF SHE COULD LIE LIKE THAT SO METHODICALLY, SHE COULD BE HIDING SOMETHING DIRECTLY RELATING TO GARNETT AND HIS CARE. [ MONITORS BEEPING ] Narrator: DETECTIVES NOW REALIZE THEY ARE DEALING WITH A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. BUT THEY ARE STILL NO CLOSER TO FINDING AN EXPLANATION FOR GARNETT'S SODIUM POISONING. THEN SUDDENLY, THE INVESTIGATION TAKES ANOTHER TURN. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] BUDNICK. Budnick: THURSDAY MORNING, I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL. OH, REALLY? I IMMEDIATELY TOLD DETECTIVE DUNN, "WE NEED TO GO OVER TO THE FELLOWSHIP COMMUNITY." THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING STARTED TO COME TOGETHER REAL QUICKLY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. Narrator: VALERIE TELLS THE DETECTIVES THAT AFTER GARNETT WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL, SHE WENT TO LACEY'S APARTMENT AND REMOVED SOMETHING SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE. BUT IT'S HER REASON FOR DOING SO THAT'S TRULY SHOCKING. I GOT A CALL FROM LACEY. I need you to let yourself into the apartment and get rid of Garnett's feeding bag. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. PLEASE CAN YOU JUST GET RID OF IT? AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY. PLEASE, PLEASE. OF COURSE. OF -- OF COURSE, LACEY, Whatever you need. WITH VALERIE'S REVELATION, THE DETECTIVES MAY HAVE THEIR FIRST PIECE OF EVIDENCE, ALONG WITH THE PRIME SUSPECT. WE HAD A PUZZLE THAT WAS THROWN UP IN THE AIR. AND NOW WE'RE STARTING TO PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER. AND NOW IT'S STARTING TO POINT MORE TOWARDS LACEY DID SOMETHING WRONG TO HER SON. Narrator: THEY RUSHED THE FEEDING BAG TO THE LAB. WITHIN THE HOUR, CARFI GETS A CALL. THE LAB TECHNICIAN CALLED ME. HE SAID, "DANNY, SOMEBODY PUT SALT IN HIS FEEDING BAG." THE SODIUM LEVELS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. I -- I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT, "BOY, OH, BOY, THIS GIRL JUST POISONED HER SON." Narrator: BUT WITH NO LOCKS ON THE DOORS AND THE SCENE DISTURBED, THE DETECTIVES HAVE NO WAY TO PROVE LACEY PUT THE SODIUM IN THE BAG. THANK YOU. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] LATER THAT MORNING, LACEY FINALLY ORDERS GARNETT TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT AND SHARES THE NEWS THAT HER 5-YEAR-OLD SON IS DEAD. [ MONITOR FLATLINES ] AS EVER, THE INTERNET GIVES HER EXACTLY WHAT SHE NEEDS, SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT. Dunn: AT THAT POINT, LACEY SPEARS WAS UNAWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE CAUSED HER SON'S DEATH. Narrator: SO WHILE LACEY PLAYS THE GRIEVING MOTHER FOR HER ONLINE COMMUNITY, DETECTIVES SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR EVIDENCE THAT WILL TIE HER TO THE CRIME. I KNEW LACEY SPEARS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF GARNETT AND NOW WE HAD TO PROVE IT. Narrator: IF THEY DON'T, LACEY JUST MIGHT GET AWAY WITH THE MURDER OF HER OWN SON. Carfi: WE DECIDED TO INTERVIEW EVERYONE IN THIS CHILD'S LIFE HOPING THAT WE WOULD FIND SOMETHING TO PUT THIS CASE TO BED. Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER, THEY INTERVIEW A NURSE FROM THE FELLOWSHIP. DURING THE CONVERSATION WITH HER, SHE ASKED US IF WE EVER LOOKED AT THE VIDEO ON THE EEG MACHINE. Dunn: I HAD NEVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH A CASE THAT INVOLVED AN EEG MONITOR BEFORE. I WAS UNAWARE THAT A VIDEO WAS ON THE MACHINE. Narrator: THIS COULD BE THE LAST PUZZLE PIECE THAT WILL PUT GARNETT'S KILLER BEHIND BARS. BUT NOTHING WILL PREPARE THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO FIND. IT WAS THE WORST THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. Narrator: DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING LACEY SPEARS FOR THE MURDER OF HER 5-YEAR-OLD SON, GARNETT, HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT AN EEG VIDEO MIGHT HAVE RECORDED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG BOY IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS. IF THERE'S ONE THING IN THIS WHOLE INVESTIGATION I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO, IT WOULD'VE BEEN TO WATCH THAT VIDEO. THAT VIDEO'S GONNA STICK WITH ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I'VE LOST SLEEP OVER IT. IT'S STILL VERY EMOTIONAL. Narrator: DETECTIVES SCAN THROUGH THE VIDEO TO THE MOMENTS BEFORE GARNETT'S FINAL FATAL SEIZURE. Budnick: LACEY TOOK GARNETT OUT OF THE BED... WALKED INTO THE BATHROOM OFF THE SCREEN. AND THEN LACEY'S SEEN WALKING PAST THE FOOT OF THE BED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND COMES BACK WITH A CONNECTING TUBE FOR THE FEEDING TUBE. SHE WENT BACK INTO THE BATHROOM. A LITTLE WHILE LATER, LACEY TAKES HIM OUT OF THE BATHROOM AND PUTS HIM ON THE BED. AND THEN, SHE JUST LOOKS AT HIM. AS IF SHE WAS WAITING FOR SOMETHING. AND THEN HIS BODY STARTS SHAKING AND THEN SHE REACHES BACK AND SHE PUSHES THE BUTTON FOR THE NURSE FOR THE CALL. HE WAS TRYING TO VOMIT, BUT HE COULDN'T. HE'S RETCHING IN PAIN, HE'S HOLDING HIS HEAD. AND AT SOME POINT, HIS BODY JUST GOES STIFF. AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT GARNETT WAS ALIVE AS FAR AS I COULD SEE. WHATEVER SHE DID TO HIM IN THAT BATHROOM IS WHAT KILLED HIM. IT WAS THE WORST THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. Narrator: ON JUNE 17TH, 2014, LACEY SPEARS IS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF HER 5-YEAR-OLD SON, GARNETT. LAB RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE FEEDING BAG LACEY ASKED HER FRIEND, VALERIE TO DESTROY CONTAINED MORE THAN 20 GRAMS OF SODIUM -- THE EQUIVALENT OF 69 RESTAURANT SALT PACKETS. IT WOULD APPEAR, LOOKING AT THE FACTS OF THE LACEY SPEARS CASE THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM A DISORDER WE REFER TO AS MUNCHAUSEN BY PROXY, WHICH IS A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER WHEREBY THE INDIVIDUAL THEMSELVES MAKES SOMEONE WHO THEY TAKE CARE OF SICK, WHICH GETS THEM A LOT OF ATTENTION AND SYMPATHY. HE'S GONNA BE OKAY, YOU KNOW, HE'S A STRONG, LITTLE MAN. INITIALLY SHE WAS THE VICTIM... [ BABY CRIES ] BUT THEN SHE REALIZED SHE COULD GET ALL OF THAT SAME ATTENTION, BUT EVEN MORE SO, IT WAS MAGNIFIED BECAUSE IT WASN'T HER, IT WAS HER POOR, HELPLESS CHILD. AND SO SHE STARTED MAKING GARNETT SICKER AND SICKER AND SICKER. [ BABY CRIES ] Narrator: INVESTIGATORS TROLLING THROUGH GARNETT'S BRIEF LIFE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE BLEAKEST OF TRUTHS. NOT ONE OF THE PAINFUL SURGERIES HE ENDURED WAS NECESSARY. Carfi: THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE, OTHER THAN WHAT LACEY WAS DOING TO GARNETT, OF THAT CHILD BEING SICK IN ANY WAY. Narrator: MEDICAL RECORDS ALSO REVEAL THAT GARNETT SUFFERED A PREVIOUS HIGH SODIUM EPISODE BACK IN ALABAMA. LACEY HAD BEEN POISONING HER SON WITH SALT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I THINK THE INTERNET CREATES A NEW DIMENSION IN THIS CASE THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THE INTERNET BECOMES A GIANT ECHO CHAMBER, WHEREBY, YOU'RE NOT JUST DEALING WITH YOUR IMMEDIATE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY, BUT YOU'RE DEALING WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. SHE COULDN'T STOP. SHE WAS GETTING SO MUCH OF WHAT SHE NEEDED PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT HER SON JUST BECAME A PROP IN THAT HORROR SHOW OF LIFE THAT SHE CREATED. AND IN THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL WORLD OF THE INTERNET, WHERE PEOPLE ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU TELL THEM, SHE COULD LITERALLY GET AWAY WITH MURDER. Narrator: BUT IN THE VERY REAL WORLD OF A NEW YORK COURTROOM ON MARCH 2nd, 2015, SHE IS FOUND GUILTY OF GARNETT'S MURDER AND IS SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON. DESPITE ALL LACEY'S LIES ABOUT HER OWN FATHER, HE CONTINUED TO SUPPORT HER THROUGHOUT HER TRIAL. A PATERNITY TEST LATER REVEALED THAT GARNETT'S REAL FATHER WAS CHRIS HILL, A NEIGHBOR OF LACEY'S FROM ALABAMA. SHE HAD TOLD HIM THE BABY WASN'T HIS. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW AND LOVED LITTLE GARNETT, THE WOUNDS WILL NEVER FULLY HEAL. Philipson: WHEN THE ATTENTION WAS ALL ON LACEY, THERE WAS NEVER ANY TIME TO QUESTION IF ANYTHING WAS GOING ON WITH GARNETT. ALL YOU SAW WAS GARNETT. HE'S JUST BUBBLY AND HAPPY. Lynch: HOW DO YOU EVEN TRY TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SHE DID THAT TO HIM ON PURPOSE? IT'S JUST REALLY HARD TO ACCEPT HOW MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT LITTLE BOY WENT THROUGH. I JUST WON'T EVER UNDERSTAND. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
