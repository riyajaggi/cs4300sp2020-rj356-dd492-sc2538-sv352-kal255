 Interpreter: I ALWAYS HAD DREAMS FOR MY SONS. HAVING A FAMILY HAS BEEN THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME, TO HAVE MY CHILDREN. SINCE THE MOMENT THEY WERE BORN, MY LIFE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER. WE WERE ALWAYS SHORT OF MONEY, BUT WE HAD A LOT OF LOVE. Narrator: RALPH'S LANDSCAPING BUSINESS AND CELIA'S JOB AT THE LOCAL MARKET JUST ABOUT KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER. EVERY SPARE DOLLAR IS PUT TOWARDS EDDIE'S DREAM OF BECOMING A PRO BOXER. EDDIE AND HIS DAD AND BROTHER HAVE CONVERTED THEIR GARAGE INTO A BOXING GYM. Gilbert: FROM A YOUNG AGE, EDDIE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO PRO. WHETHER IT WAS TO BE A CHAMPION OR NOT, IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER 'CAUSE HE LOVED IT. MY DAD GATHERED UP SOME MONEY, CLEANED OUT THE GARAGE AND MADE IT A GYM. SOME OF THE 'HOOD KIDS WOULD WALK BY, SEE IT AND BE INTERESTED, AND IT JUST KIND OF EVOLVED FROM THERE. Narrator: THE LEALS' NEIGHBORHOOD IS FULL OF CHOLOS, SLANG FOR HISPANIC GANGSTERS. EDDIE HOPES THAT, BY OPENING UP THE GYM TO LOCAL KIDS, HE CAN GIVE THEM AN ALTERNATIVE TO JOINING THE LOCAL GANGS. BUT IT'S AN UPHILL STRUGGLE. Epps: RALPH AND EDDIE PUT IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND DEDICATION AROUND, UH, KIDS WHO WERE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF LEADERSHIP. THERE WAS A LOT OF KIDS, UH, AT THAT GYM THAT THAT WAS THEIR FAMILY, AND THAT WAS ME INCLUDED. Interpreter for Celia: RALPH AND MY CHILDREN ALWAYS WORKED WITH THE COMMUNITY, HELPING CHILDREN TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE STREETS. Narrator: SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD MANUEL GUZMAN IS A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT. HE'S HOPING BOXING CAN GIVE HIM A FOCUS AND KEEP HIM SAFE. Eddie: GUYS, WHO'S NEXT? Narrator: RALPH LEAL LEADS HIS KIDS BY EXAMPLE. HE MADE MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND WANTS HIS KIDS TO AVOID THE SAME PAIN. Epps: RALPH HAD GREW UP IN L.A., HISPANIC KID IN THE '80s. EH, LIFE'S TOUGH. HE TOLD KIDS, "KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN. KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE", AND HE STEERED KIDS AWAY FROM THE TROUBLE CROWD. RALPH AND EDDIE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO PROVE. THEY WEREN'T PROUD. THEY DEFINITELY WEREN'T MATERIALISTIC. Narrator: EDDIE'S DEDICATION TO BOXING MEANS HE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO MEET GIRLS. SO, LIKE A LOT OF YOUNG MEN, HE TURNS TO THE INTERNET. Gilbert: EDDIE WAS ON FACEBOOK A LOT. HE LOVED TO BE CONNECTED WITH EVERYONE. Eddie: HEY, MOM. Celia: I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEND YOU'RE HIDING FROM ME. Eddie: NO. DON'T WORRY, MOM, YOU'LL KNOW. Celia: AND WHAT KIND OF A GIRL ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? Eddie: A PRETTY ONE. Celia: A PRETTY ONE? WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO OFFER TO A PRETTY GIRL. [ LAUGHS ] Gilbert: EVERY YOUNG GUY USES FACEBOOK IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO TALK TO A GIRL. Narrator: WHEN EDDIE GETS A FRIEND REQUEST FROM A GIRL HE HAS NEVER MET, HE'S INTRIGUED. REBECCA SANTIAGO IS GORGEOUS, LIVES IN SAN JACINTO AND EVEN BETTER, SHE'S SINGLE. EDDIE DOESN'T THINK REBECCA SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF PARTY GIRL WHO WOULD HANG OUT WITH CHOLOS. SHE'S STRAIGHT-LACED, JUST LIKE EDDIE. TO HIM, THEY LOOK LIKE A PERFECT MATCH. Interpreter for Celia: I ALWAYS HAD DREAMS FOR MY SONS. I WANTED EDDIE TO GET MARRIED. ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT THE FIGHT? - Eddie: NO. - Narrator: EDDIE'S MOM WORRIES ABOUT HIM GETTING BEATEN UP IN THE RING. Eddie: BUT YOU SEEM NERVOUS, MOM. Interpreter: I NEVER LIKED WATCHING MY SON BOX. HE ASKED ME WHY AND I ANSWERED THAT IF HE EVER TOOK ME, I WAS GOING TO TAKE MY SHOE OFF AND CLIMB INTO THE RING TO HIT HIS OPPONENT AND HE WAS GOING TO BE DISQUALIFIED. Eddie: DON'T WORRY SO MUCH, MOM. Narrator: BUT THE REAL DANGER FOR EDDIE MAY BE MUCH CLOSER TO HOME. Celia: GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE. Narrator: WITH LOCAL FAMILIES EAGER FOR THEIR SONS TO HAVE A HEALTHY OUTLET, THE GYM GETS A LOT OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT. BUT THE CHOLOS SEEM DETERMINED TO GET IN THE WAY. Gilbert: IN SAN JACINTO, WHERE I GREW UP, THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF GANGS. THE CHOLO ARE HISPANIC, USUALLY CHICANO, ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA, BUT GANGSTER ESSENTIALLY. IT'S DRUGS, FIGHTING, SHOOTING. IF YOU GROW UP WITH NOTHING AND YOU SEE THESE GUYS, YOU KNOW, OUT IN THE STREETS, SEMI SUCCESSFUL, THE LIFESTYLE CAN BE APPEALING. A LOT OF US ARE TRYING TO BETTER OURSELVES AND NOT FALL INTO IT. WE DID HAVE SOME TOUGH CHARACTERS COME IN AND WANT TO PROVE THEMSELVES. Eddie: WHAT'S UP, BOYS? THERE'S NO DRINKING HERE, MAN. Man: WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK INSIDE BEFORE YOU REGRET WHAT YOU SAY TO ME? Eddie: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, HUH? Gilbert: EDDIE, HEY, HEY, EDDIE. EDDIE, EDDIE. WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO TRAINING, MAN. COME ON, WE DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW. Man: WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK INSIDE? Gilbert: HEY, HEY, COME ON. YOU GOT -- YOU GOT BETTER PLACES TO GO, RIGHT? WHERE'S THE CHICAS AT, HUH? CHECK OUT THE PIMPIN' RIDE, MAN, IT'S ALL GOOD. Man: IT'S ALL RIGHT, MAN. LET'S GO BACK INSIDE. Narrator: IT'S A WIN FOR THE GOOD GUYS -- THIS TIME. AFTER EDDIE AND HIS BROTHER GET THE CHOLOS TO BACK DOWN, EDDIE'S ON A HIGH. AND IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE REBECCA SANTIAGO APPRECIATES A REAL TOUGH GUY LIKE EDDIE, NOT CHOLOS WHO ARE ALL MACHO SWAGGER. Interpreter: EDDIE WANTED TO HAVE A WOMAN IN HIS LIFE. HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE HIMSELF HIS LAST CHANCE IN BOXING AND IF THAT DIDN'T WORK HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED. HE WANTED TO HAVE CHILDREN. Narrator: BUT WHEN EDDIE ASKS REBECCA FOR A DATE SHE SEEMS TO TURN SHY. STILL, EDDIE IS NOT ABOUT TO GIVE UP. WITH SO MUCH GANG ACTIVITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE LEAL FAMILY IS ALWAYS HAPPY TO HAVE THE COPS CLOSE AT HAND. SARGEANT BOB EPPS REGULARLY COMES DOWN TO TRAIN AND KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS. Epps: I WAS TRAINING FOR AN EVENT CALLED THE BATTLE OF THE BADGES AND IT'S A CHARITY EVENT. RALPH AND EDDIE GAVE 100% TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE KIDS. IF SOMEBODY NEEDED THEIR TIME, THEY'D GIVE IT. A LOT OF THE KIDS WEREN'T SURE WHY EDDIE AND RALPH WERE FRIENDS WITH THE COPS AND A LOT OF THESE KIDS HAD HAD NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES IN THEIR HOMES WITH COPS. MANY OF THESE KIDS HAD FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WERE SERVING, UH, EXTENSIVE JAIL SENTENCES. Eddie: ALL RIGHT, GENTS, IT'S A WRAP. SEE YOU TOMORROW, BUDDY. Celia: HEY, HOW'D IT GO? Eddie: HEY MAMA, GOOD. Celia: GOOD. Eddie: SEE THE NEW GUY? Celia: YEAH, YEAH. THE -- THE TALL GUY OVER THERE. Eddie: THE BIG GUY, YEAH. Narrator: BUT NO SOONER DO THE COPS LEAVE THAN THE CHOLOS ARE BACK TO HASSLE EDDIE. Eddie: MAMA, STAY HERE FOR A MINUTE. WHAT'S UP, GUYS? WHAT DO YOU WANT, MAN? [ CELIA SCREAMS ] Gilbert: MY MOM, IN PARTICULAR, SEES ANYONE THAT SHE WOULD DESCRIBE AS A CHOLO AND AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMES THE WORST. UM, WHICH IS KIND OF UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN YOU GREW UP AROUND HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF. Celia: THEY'RE GOING TO COME AFTER US ONE DAY, DON'T DO THAT. Narrator: EDDIE HAS NO IDEA HE'S ABOUT TO LEARN JUST HOW FAR THE CHOLOS WILL GO TO PROVE WHO'S IN CHARGE IN SAN JACINTO. Eddie: GOOD MORNING, BUDDY. WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST? Narrator: IT'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOR EDDIE LEAL AND HIS FAMILY TO KEEP GANGS AWAY FROM THEIR BOXING CLUB IN SAN JACINTO, CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT THE CHOLOS DON'T TAKE REJECTION WELL. Gilbert: MY BROTHER DECIDED TO GO AND GET SOME FOOD, HE COMES BACK IN IN PRETTY SHOOK UP. HE'S LIKE, "HEY, DID YOU SEE THE CAR?" Eddie: YO, BERT, WHERE'S THE CAR? Gilbert: IT'S OUTSIDE. I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, IT SHOULD BE OUTSIDE." Eddie: IT'S NOT. Gilbert: SO MY BROTHER STARTS PANICKING. IF IT'S NOT THERE, IT'S STOLEN. HI, I'D LIKE TO REPORT A STOLEN VEHICLE. Narrator: THE CHOLOS HAD STOLEN EDDIE'S CAR THE NIGHT BEFORE. Wortman: SUSPECTS WERE CAUGHT IN HIS VEHICLE AND ARRESTED IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. [ MOBILE RINGING ] Narrator: EDDIE DECIDES HE HAS TO STAND UP TO THE CAR THIEVES. Eddie: HELLO? Wortman: THE LONG BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD TO CONTACT MR. LEAL AND ASK HIM IF HE WANTED TO PRESS CHARGES. Eddie: YES. YES, I DO WANT TO PRESS CHARGES. Gilbert: THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE CAR ENDED UP TOTALING IT IN A CHASE. Narrator: STILL, THOUGH THREE CHOLOS ARE ARRESTED... Man: YO, HOMIE! Narrator:...ONLY ONE IS TAKEN TO JAIL. AND A FEW DAYS LATER HIS BUDDIES ARE BACK ON THE STREETS. THE LEAL FAMILY BAND TOGETHER AND BUY A NEW CAR FOR EDDIE. THEY CAN'T LET THE THUGS GET THE UPPER HAND. Epps: HEY, HEY, NICE NEW SET OF WHEELS THERE, EDDIE. Eddie: THANK YOU. Ralph: HEY, HEY, BOBBY. Narrator: IT'S SEVERAL NIGHTS AFTER THE CAR WAS STOLEN, EDDIE'S NEW FACEBOOK FRIEND, REBECCA SANTIAGO, COMES ONLINE. SHE SAYS SHE'S UP FOR HANGING OUT. THOUGH THE POST ISN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED TO EDDIE, HE'S THE FIRST TO TAKE THE BAIT. BUT ONCE AGAIN, REBECCA LEAVES HIM HANGING. Interpreter for Celia: I WENT IN AND STOOD BY EDDIE'S BEDROOM DOOR. I COULD SEE IN HIS FACE THAT HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME IN BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE COMPUTER. GOOD NIGHT, BABY. Eddie: GOOD NIGHT. Narrator: SEVERAL AGONIZING MINUTES PASS, AND THEN FINALLY... Gilbert: I THINK I WALKED BY AT SOME POINT AND SAW HIM JUST SITTING AT THE COMPUTER. Eddie: HEY, GIL? I MIGHT TAKE THE CAR TONIGHT. Gilbert: AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "OKAY." SOUNDS GOOD, MAN. Narrator: EDDIE AND REBECCA AGREE TO MEET AT A NEARBY PARK. IT'S LUCKY THAT EDDIE HAS A NEW CAR. REBECCA WANTS TO KNOW IF EDDIE'S COMING ALONE. HE CONFIRMS IT'S JUST HIM. Gilbert: IT'S LATER IN THE NIGHT, UM, I THINK I HAD ALREADY FALLEN ASLEEP. HE SENT ME A TEXT MESSAGE SAYING, YOU KNOW, "I'LL BE BACK. I'LL SEE YOU LATER." UM, I DIDN'T SEE THAT UNTIL THE MORNING. Narrator: WHEN EDDIE ARRIVES AT CUTTING PARK, HE SEES NO SIGN OF THE SEXY BRUNETTE. HE GOES HOME, DEFEATED. WHEN HE CHECKS HIS FACEBOOK, THERE'S A MESSAGE FROM REBECCA. LOOKS LIKE IT'S GAME ON AGAIN. IT'S NEARLY 2:00 A.M., BUT IF EDDIE DOESN'T MEET REBECCA TONIGHT, HE WORRIES IT MAY NEVER HAPPEN. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY IS MEMORIAL DAY, AND EVERYONE IN THE LEAL FAMILY HAS THE DAY OFF WORK. Gilbert: AND I COULD SMELL THE FOOD COMING FROM THE KITCHEN. - HOLA. - Celia: HOLA, BABY. IS EDDIE SLEEPING? Gilbert: I DON'T KNOW. Interpreter: THE NEXT MORNING WAS A PUBLIC HOLIDAY, A DAY WHEN ALL OF US WERE AT HOME. BREAKFAST WAS NEARLY READY. I'M GOING TO GO WAKE EDDIE UP. Ralph: READY FOR SOME EGGS? Gilbert: OH, YEAH, POPS. OH, LOOKS GOOD. [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Celia: RAFA, EDDIE'S NOT HERE! Interpreter: AT THIS TIME, HIS DAD STARTED TO WORRY. Ralph: STRAIGHT TO VOICE MAIL. GILBERT! GILBERT! - Gilbert: YEAH? - Ralph: GO DOWN TO POWERHOUSE AND SEE IF YOUR BROTHER IS THERE. Gilbert: OKAY. HE TELLS ME, YOU KNOW, "JUST HEAD TO HIS WORK." THE POWERHOUSE GYM WAS A LOCAL FITNESS GYM WHERE MY BROTHER WORKED AS A PERSONAL TRAINER, MAYBE HE WENT TO PICK UP A CHECK, SOMETHING, ANYTHING. SO I JUMPED IN MY MOM'S CAR AND I START HEADING OVER. [ MOBILE RINGING ] I GET A PHONE CALL FROM MY DAD AND, YOU KNOW, MY FIRST INSTINCT IS, "OH, HE'S HOME." [ RINGING CONTINUES ] I ANSWER AND IT'S A -- A DETECTIVE. YEAH. HE TELLS ME, "WE'RE OVER HERE AT YOUR HOUSE, UM, WITH YOUR DAD, AND WE THINK YOU SHOULD COME HOME." Celia: WHERE'S EDDIE? [ RALPH SOBBING ] Wortman: EDDIE WAS A GOOD KID. Gilbert: SO I GET OUT THE CAR, AND I'M PRETTY SHAKEN UP. I HEAR SOMEBODY SAY, "OH, THAT'S HIM." ONE OF THE DETECTIVES TURNS. AND HE INTERCEPTS ME. AND HE'S LIKE, "COME TALK WITH ME." AND SO I FOLLOW HIM TO HIS CAR. HE SITS ME DOWN IN THE PASSENGER SIDE. HE SITS IN THE DRIVER SIDE. ALL RIGHT. HE'S ASKING ME THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY BROTHER AND JEWELRY THAT HE WORE. Wortman: THIS RING LOOK FAMILIAR? Gilbert: YEAH. THAT WAS HIS. "DOES THIS BELONG TO HIM? DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?" Interpreter for Celia: I HEARD RAFA SCREAMING. HE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND -- AND I DIDN'T. I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON. Gilbert: BLACK HAIR, MY BUILD, I -- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. Wortman: OKAY. Gilbert: AFTER ALL THAT, HE SAID, "OKAY. BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME, WE -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOUR BROTHER HAS BEEN MURDERED, AND... [ BREAKING UP ] WE'RE INVES-- CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THAT RIGHT NOW." I COULDN'T EVEN BREAK DOWN. I WAS IN SUCH SHOCK. [ CELIA WAILING ] Wortman: OKAY. Gilbert: HE'S CRYING. AND HE'S TELLING ME, "THEY KILLED -- THEY KILLED EDDIE." I HEAR SCREAMING FROM INSIDE, AND IT'S MY MOM. AT THIS POINT, TEARS ARE STREAMING DOWN HER FACE. SEEING ALL MY FAMILY IN THE STATE THAT THEY WERE, JUST -- JUST... IT WAS OVERWHELMING. I STILL SEE IT. Epps: I GOT A PHONE CALL... Man: IT'S OKAY, RALPH. [ BREAKING UP ] AND I REMEMBER HIM SAYING, "I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO MAKE THE CALL, BUT NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO CALL YOU 'CAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TIGHT YOU ARE WITH EDDIE AND RALPH." Interpreter for Celia: I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHO COULD'VE HURT HIM LIKE THAT BECAUSE... I KNEW THAT HE WAS A GOOD BOY, AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHO COULD'VE DONE THAT TO HIM, NO. Epps: I SAW RALPH OUT IN THE YARD ON HIS KNEES SCREAMING AND CRYING. Ralph: BOB, BOBBY, THEY KILLED MY BABY. Epps: AND YOU JUST -- I JUST -- I HELD HIM AND HUGGED HIM. HE CRIED AND SAID, "THEY KILLED MY BABY." Narrator: THE LEAL FAMILY ARE DEVASTATED BY THE NEWS THAT THEIR SON EDDIE HAD BEEN MURDERED THE NIGHT BEFORE. THE POLICE HAVE TOLD THEM HE WAS FOUND SHOT DEAD IN HIS CAR. LEAD INVESTIGATOR RANDALL WORTMAN AND DEPUTY D.A. DANIEL DELIMON HAD BEEN THE FIRST ON THE SCENE. Wortman: I APPROACHED THE VEHICLE, LOOKED AT THE DRIVER. IT WAS A MALE HISPANIC, ABOUT 23 YEARS OLD AND LATER IDENTIFIED AS EDDIE LEAL FROM HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE. Delimon: WE NOTICED THERE WAS FINGERPRINTS IN THE CAR. THE OTHER THING, UH, THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS THESE CASINGS. Narrator: GETTING ENOUGH DNA FROM THE PRINTS OR THE BULLET CASINGS WILL BE A LONG SHOT, BUT THERE'S A SLIM CHANCE IT MAY LEAD THEM TO THE KILLER. LATER THAT MORNING, POLICE HEAD TO THE LEALS' HOME TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHY EDDIE WAS KILLED. Wortman: I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THIS, GILBERT. Narrator: ALL GILBERT KNOWS IS THAT, WHEN HE TALKED TO HIS BROTHER LAST NIGHT, HE SEEMED HAPPY AND HE WAS ON HIS COMPUTER. Wortman: SO WHAT WAS YOUR BROTHER DOING LAST NIGHT? Gilbert: HE WAS ON HIS COMPUTER. Wortman: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. Delimon: AND IMMEDIATELY, ON THAT SCREEN CAME A FACEBOOK IMAGINE OF REBECCA SANTIAGO, A VERY ATTRACTIVE FEMALE, WHO IT LOOKED LIKE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH EDDIE LEAL. EDDIE LEAL HAD NOT CLOSED OUT THAT WINDOW. AND THE LAST LINE IN THAT CONVERSATION TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GONNA MEET. Epps: I COULDN'T THINK OF ANY REASON WHY EDDIE WOULD WANT TO GO OVER THERE, UH, OR WHAT HE WAS DOING UP THAT LATE AT NIGHT 'CAUSE IT WAS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE EDDIE HAD COMMUNICATED WITH SOMEBODY ON FACEBOOK. AND HE WAS GOING OVER TO MEET UP WITH SOME GIRL. AND NOBODY REALLY KNEW WHAT THE PATH WAS FROM GOING TO MEET THIS GIRL TO DEAD IN A CAR. Narrator: BACK AT RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, DETECTIVE WORTMAN LOOKS INTO THE THUGS WHO HAD STOLEN EDDIE'S CAR THE PREVIOUS WEEK. Wortman: AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER THEY WERE OUT OF CUSTODY, THEY WERE RELEASED. WE WERE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS WAS SOME KIND OF RETALIATION FOR THE FACT THAT HE PRESSED CHARGES AGAINST THEM. Narrator: AND AS DETECTIVE WORTMAN IS ABOUT TO DISCOVER, THESE GUYS ARE NO SMALL-TIME CAR JACKERS. Wortman: WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE POLICE REPORTS FOR THE GUYS THAT WERE ARRESTED, THEY WERE IN THESE DATABASES AS GANG MEMBERS. Narrator: AS WORTMAN PURSUES THE CAR THEFT ANGLE, DEPUTY D.A. DELIMON SUBPOENAS FACEBOOK FOR THE IP ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH REBECCA SANTIAGO'S PROFILE. AS SOON AS HE GETS IT, HE CAN FIND OUT WHERE REBECCA WAS WHEN SHE LAST MESSAGED EDDIE. Delimon: WE KNEW FROM PAST INVESTIGATIONS THAT FACEBOOK WOULD KEEP RECORDS OF THE IP ADDRESS WHERE THE PERSON USING THIS PROFILE WOULD LOG ON. Narrator: TWO DAYS LATER, DETECTIVE WORTMAN HITS A HEAD END WITH THE CAR THIEVES. ALL THEIR ALIBIS CHECK OUT FOR THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. Delimon: THERE IS A KILLER ON THE LOOSE. AND APART FROM THE COMPUTER, WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE. Narrator: THREE DAYS AFTER THE MURDER, DEPUTY D.A. DELIMON GETS A STREET ADDRESS FOR REBECCA SANTIAGO. Delimon: THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE US AN ADDRESS. THE ADDRESS WAS HOLSTEINER CIRCLE AND IT WAS WITHIN 100 YARDS OF WHERE EDDIE LEAL'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND. Narrator: WHEN HE ARRIVES AT THE HOUSE WHERE REBECCA'S PROFILE IS REGISTERED, THERE'S NO REBECCA, ONLY A FAMILY NAMED THE GUZMANS. Delimon: I BEGAN TO WONDER, DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT ADDRESS, DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE? Wortman: WE TRANSPORTED THE FAMILY MEMBERS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MOTHER, TO THE SHERIFF'S STATION TO INTERVIEW THEM. Delimon: MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR ME TO QUESTION THEM, OKAY? WE SEARCHED EVERY ROOM. THERE WAS A DESKTOP COMPUTER INSIDE, UH, THE 17-YEAR-OLD YOUNG MAN'S BEDROOM WHO TURNED OUT TO BE MANUEL GUZMAN. Narrator: COMPUTER FORENSICS EXPERT TONY PELATO GETS TO WORK ANALYZING THE COMPUTER. Pelato: THIS CASE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE THAT I EVER WORKED ON. Delimon: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TONY PELATO DID WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE DID A RAM DUMP ON THE COMPUTER IN MANUEL GUZMAN'S ROOM BECAUSE IT WAS STILL ON AND HE KNEW THAT THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE DESTROYED IF HE UNPLUGGED THE COMPUTER. Narrator: BACK AT THE STATION, DETECTIVE WORTMAN INTERVIEWS 17-YEAR-OLD MANUEL GUZMAN. - Wortman: HI, MANUEL. - Guzman: HELLO. Wortman: I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. Guzman: SURE. Wortman: HE WAS VERY CALM, VERY COLD, NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING. WHERE WERE YOU IN THE EARLY HOURS OF MONDAY, MAY 30. Guzman: I WAS ASLEEP IN MY ROOM. Wortman: DO YOU KNOW AN EDDIE LEAL? Guzman: YEAH, THE NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR. I THINK HIS FAMILY HAS A BOXING RING OUT OF THEIR HOME? Wortman: DURING THE INTERVIEW WITH MANUEL GUZMAN, HE DENIED HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOMICIDE. HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS ASLEEP THE NIGHT OF THE HOMICIDE. Ralph: PUNCH, GOOD, GOOD. Narrator: MANUEL KNOWS EDDIE FROM THE GYM, HE HAD TAKEN ONE BOXING LESSON WITH HIM. Gilbert: I, UH, DIDN'T TAKE MUCH INTEREST, I NOTICED HIM. BUT HE DIDN'T STAND OUT TO ME, EITHER. Narrator: BECAUSE MANUEL IS A MINOR, THE POLICE CAN ONLY HOLD HIM FOR A MAXIMUM OF SIX HOURS. WITH NOTHING CONCRETE LINKING HIM TO EDDIE'S MURDER, THEY HAVE TO LET HIM GO. Interpreter for Celia: IT WAS IN THE FIRST WEEK WHEN I HEARD THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN QUESTIONED BASED ON THE POLICE INVESTIGATION ON THE COMPUTER. BUT LATER I FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN RELEASED. AND THEN I HEARD NOTHING. THE FIRST TIME THAT I SPOKE TO THE ATTORNEY HE TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO BE VERY PATIENT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO TAKE THEM A LONG TIME TO FIND EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEEDED. Delimon: YEAH, IF YOU COULD LET VICTIM SERVICES KNOW THAT I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH THEM. Narrator: THE FIRST EVIDENCE TO COME BACK FROM THE LAB FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IS FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS. Wortman: WE FOUND SOME FINGERPRINT MATCHES TO THE VICTIM AND THEN SOME PRINTS THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY BELONGED TO. WE WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO FIND OUT THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO LEFT THE FINGERPRINTS. Narrator: IN ORDER TO RULE OUT THE LEAL FAMILY WHO LEFT PRINTS IN THE CAR, THE POLICE RUN A RECORDS CHECK ON ALL OF THEM. STRANGELY, THEY CAN FIND NO RECORD OF RALPH LEAL. Wortman: RALPH LEAL? BECAUSE PEOPLE FREQUENTLY WILL USE NICKNAMES, I CALLED RALPH ON THE PHONE AND HE TOLD ME HIS ACTUAL REAL NAME WAS GILBERT LEAL. OKAY, THAT NAME IS IN OUR DATABASE. HE CONFIRMED HIS DATE OF BIRTH. WE RAN ANOTHER RECORDS CHECK AND FOUND GILBERT LEAL, THE NAME HE GAVE ME WITH HIS DATE OF BIRTH HAD A MURDER WARRANT OUT OF L.A. COUNTY FOR A HOMICIDE THAT OCCURRED IN THE 1980s. Narrator: SINCE RALPH, aka GILBERT LEAL, HAS SUCH A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE, IT'S A SHOCK TO FIND OUT HE'S WANTED FOR MURDER. FOR AN ALREADY GRIEVING FAMILY, IT'S DEVASTATING. Gilbert: RANDY AND A FEW OTHER DETECTIVES AND A SQUAD CAR OR TWO, UM, SHOWED UP. Wortman: ALL RIGHT, SO TELL ME YOUR STORY, RALPH. Gilbert: MY DAD AND RANDY HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT, I'M ASSUMING, WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED 30 YEARS AGO. I COULDN'T STAND TO WATCH MY DAD HAVE CUFFS SLAPPED ON HIM. Wortman: I'M SORRY TO DO THIS. WE JUST HAD TO HANDCUFF HIM AND PUT HIM IN THE CAR AND BOOK INTO JAIL FOR THE HOMICIDE. Gilbert: MY MOM WAS STILL FOCUSING ON TRYING TO COPE WITH MY BROTHER'S MURDER. SHE WAS HURT THAT THE FAMILY WAS SO BROKEN. HALF OF US ARE GONE AND IT TOOK IT'S TOLL, IT WAS TOO MUCH. Narrator: WITH EDDIE'S FATHER INVOLVED IN A MURDER 30 YEARS PRIOR, IS IT POSSIBLE HE'S ALSO INVOLVED IN THE SLAYING OF HIS SON? Narrator: EDDIE LEAL'S FATHER'S PAST HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH HIM. HE'S CHARGED WITH VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND ASSAULT FOR A MURDER IN THE 1980s. BUT NOTHING LINKS HIM TO HIS SON'S MURDER. Gilbert: MY DAD FELT THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, MAYBE IT WAS KARMA COMING BACK TO HIM FOR LIVING THE LIFESTYLE THAT HE DID. Narrator: ONE WEEK AFTER EDDIE WAS SLAIN, WITH INCONCLUSIVE FINGERPRINTS, NO WITNESS AND NO MURDER WEAPON, POLICE TURNED BACK TO THE FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF MANUEL GUZMAN'S COMPUTER. Pelato: WHEN THEY ASKED ME HOW LONG THESE EXAMS TAKE, MY ANSWER IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND 52 WEEKS, DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EXAMINATION. IN A COMPLEX HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION, YOU HAVE NO IDEA, NECESSARILY, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, WHAT WILL BE RELEVANT, WHAT WILL PROVE OR DISPROVE, UM, THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED. Narrator: THEN, SUDDENLY, THE INVESTIGATOR HITS THE JACKPOT. Delimon: TONY PELATO HAD FOUND EVIDENCE IN MANUEL GUZMAN'S COMPUTER THAT PROVED THAT THAT WAS THE COMPUTER THAT SENT THE MESSAGES TO EDDIE LEAL ON MAY 30, THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED. THE SMOKING GUN IN THIS CASE WASN'T ACTUALLY A SMOKING GUN. WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR WAS THE SMOKING COMPUTER. THE REBECCA SANTIAGO PICTURE SEEMED, TO ME, TO BE A PHOTOSHOPPED IMAGE. THERE WERE NO PICTURES WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS. IT WAS PROBABLY A FAKE PROFILE. Narrator: THE POLICE THINK BACK TO SOMETHING 17-YEAR-OLD MANUEL SAID IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW. Wortman: WHO ELSE HAS ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER? Guzman: UM, NO, IT'S MY COMPUTER, NO ONE ELSE USES IT. Delimon: HE TOLD US THAT HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM AND THAT HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO USED HIS COMPUTER THAT NIGHT. AND THAT'S WHEN INVESTIGATOR RANDY WORTMAN THEN PUSHED THE REBECCA SANTIAGO PICTURE IN FRONT OF MANUEL GUZMAN AND TOLD HIM, "WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?" Wortman: WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? Guzman: I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. Narrator: MANUEL ADMITTED HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO USED THAT COMPUTER THE NIGHT OF EDDIE'S MURDER. COULD HE HAVE POSED AS REBECCA TO LURE EDDIE TO HIS DEATH? IT'S A THEORY, BUT THE COPS DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF OR A MOTIVE THAT JUSTIFIES ARRESTING MANUEL. AND SO MANUEL REMAINS ON THE STREETS. Wortman: WE ALL BELIEVED THAT MANUEL GUZMAN WAS INVOLVED, IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO FILE A CASE AGAINST HIM. I WAS ALWAYS CONCERNED THAT MANUEL GUZMAN WAS FREE TO DO IT AGAIN. Gilbert: IT TOOK A LOT OF STRENGTH FOR ME NOT TO JUST RUSH OUT AND -- [ SIGHS ] HURT -- HURT HIM. Delimon: HIS MOM, UH, WOULD CALL ME AND IT TYPICALLY HAPPENED WHEN MANUEL GUZMAN RODE HIS BIKE PAST HER HOUSE AND SAY, "PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP ON THIS CASE." ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO WALK AWAY FROM THIS CASE AND POTENTIALLY LET A MURDERER FREE? Narrator: FOR FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR PELATO, IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME TO FIND EVIDENCE ON MANUEL'S COMPUTER THAT PUTS HIM AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. Pelato: I BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND ON THE COMPUTER TO DETERMINE WHAT ELSE WAS HAPPENING AROUND THE SAME TIME PERIOD THAT THE REBECCA SANTIAGO PROFILE WAS ACCESSED. THIS COMPUTER FORENSIC EXAMINATION ENDED UP BEING THE BIGGEST CASE OF MY CAREER. Narrator: FINALLY, PELATO FINDS WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. MANUEL LOGGED ON AND OFF AT THE EXACT TIMES THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO GO AND MEET EDDIE IN CUTTING PARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. Pelato: THE LAST MESSAGE WAS JUST PRIOR TO 2:00 AM. Delimon: AND WHEN I LOOKED MORE CLOSELY, I SAW THE MANUEL GUZMAN HAD COME UP WITH A VERY CLEVER WAY OF INSERTING HIMSELF AS A FIGURE AT THAT PARK. Narrator: REBECCA HAD TOLD EDDIE TO EXPECT HER BROTHER. Delimon: AND TO CONVINCE EDDIE LEAL THAT RATHER THAN MEETING REBECCA SANTIAGO, A FEMALE, THAT EDDIE LEAL SHOULD EXPECT A YOUNG MAN THAT WAS MANUEL GUZMAN'S AGE. Eddie: YO, ARE YOU REBECCA'S BROTHER? Guzman: YEAH, MAN. UH, YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME UP THERE. Narrator: IT'S PELATO'S NEXT DISCOVERY THAT NAILS MANUEL. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] Delimon: HELLO? YEAH. WE FOUND THAT SILVER BULLET THAT WE'D BEEN LOOKING FOR ALL ALONG. MANUEL GUZMAN MADE A MISTAKE. MANUEL GUZMAN HAD ACTUALLY E- MAILED SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY AND ADMITTED "THIS IS TITO," THE NICKNAME THAT MANUEL GUZMAN WENT BY, "AND THIS IS MY FAKE FACEBOOK PAGE THAT I USE TO MESS WITH PEOPLE." WE KNEW THAT WE HAD A WITNESS THAT WE COULD CALL TO COURT AND SAY REBECCA SANTIAGO AND MANUEL GUZMAN ARE THE SAME PERSON. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] HELLO? Narrator: THE POLICE CAN NOW PROVE THAT MANUEL WAS NOT JUST ACCESSING THE SITE TO AID IN A KILLING -- HE HAD CREATED REBECCA WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DOING EVIL. Delimon: AND AT THAT POINT, I KNEW WE GOT HIM. WE MADE THE DECISION, UH, AT THAT POINT, THAT WE WERE GOING TO ARREST MANUEL GUZMAN AND PROSECUTE HIM, UH, FOR THIS MURDER. Narrator: ON APRIL 10, 2012, NEARLY 11 MONTHS AFTER THE MURDER OF EDDIE LEAL, MANUEL GUZMAN IS ARRESTED. Delimon: INVESTIGATOR WORTMAN, UH, ASKED ME... Wortman: DO YOU THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH? Delimon: AND MY RESPONSE WAS, "THIS MAY BE ALL WE EVER HAVE." Narrator: GUZMAN MAY BE IN CUSTODY, BUT THE DETECTIVES STILL HAVE AN UPHILL STRUGGLE TO CONVINCE A JURY HE'S GUILTY. WHY WOULD THIS LOCAL KID WITH NO BEEF AGAINST EDDIE WANT HIM DEAD? WHEN THEY TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE DAYS LEADING UP TO EDDIE'S MURDER, THEY MAKE A SHOCKING DISCOVERY. Delimon: AS WE REVIEWED THOSE RECORDS, WE REALIZED THERE WERE OTHER VICTIMS PRIOR TO EDDIE LEAL'S MURDER. Narrator: POLICE BELIEVE THEY'VE GOT EDDIE LEAL'S MURDERER BEHIND BARS. BUT THEY NEED MORE EVIDENCE TO MAKE SURE HE STAYS THERE. AS THEY SIFT THROUGH MANUEL'S COMPUTER RECORDS, THEY START PAINTING A PICTURE OF A KILLER WHO HAS TRIED BEFORE. Delimon: MANUEL GUZMAN HAD TRIED TO LURE OUT THREE OTHER YOUNG MEN IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO EDDIE LEAL'S MURDER IN AN EFFORT TO MURDER THEM. Cervantes: I WAS A YOUNG 18-YEAR-OLD, AND I'M LIKE, "PHEW. THIS GIRL'S FROM MY HOMETOWN, QUITE ATTRACTIVE. I MEAN, WHY NOT?" YOU KNOW, "WHO -- WHO IS SHE? LIKE, HOW DO I NOT KNOW HER?" Narrator: LUCKILY FOR RYAN, HE WAS STATIONED IN HAWAII FOR MILITARY TRAINING. Cervantes: HOT GIRL WANTS TO HANG OUT WITH YOU THIS LATE AT NIGHT, AND I COULD HONESTLY SAY I WOULD'VE DONE THAT. Narrator: HE WAS 2,500 MILES AWAY FROM A POTENTIAL MURDERER. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT, IF PROSECUTION CAN'T GET A CONVICTION, EDDIE LEAL MAY NOT BE MANUEL'S LAST VICTIM. Cervantes: OH, MY GOD. THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME. Narrator: THE PROSECUTION IS ON THE VERGE OF MAKING HISTORY. Pelato: IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED THAT THE PROSECUTION WOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THE TRIAL KNOWING THAT THE ENTIRE CASE HINGED ON THE COMPUTER FORENSIC EVIDENCE. Interpreter for Celia: I ASKED GOD, IF HE WAS GUILTY, THEN HE HAD TO BE FOUND GUILTY AND PAY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE. Delimon: THE JURY DELIVERED A VERY SWIFT VERDICT. THEY CONVICTED MANUEL GUZMAN OF MURDER. Wortman: THE JUDGE GAVE HIM LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST SENTENCE YOU CAN GET COMMITTING A MURDER AS A JUVENILE. Narrator: TRAGICALLY, 23-YEAR-OLD EDDIE LEAL DIED BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO TOOK MANUEL'S BAIT. MANUEL WAS READY TO KILL ANYONE, EVEN SOMEONE WHO WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM CHANGE HIS LIFE. Interpreter for Celia: WHAT HURT ME THE MOST WAS TO IMAGINE MY SON DURING THOSE MOMENTS, TO IMAGINE WHAT HE HAD FELT. FOR ME AS HIS MOTHER, IT'S SO VERY DIFFICULT. Gilbert: HE WAS SLUMPED OVER IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, AND HIS PHONE WAS ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO WHERE HIS HAND WOULD'VE FALLEN. AND IT HAD THE NUMBERS 9-1 DIALED INTO IT. IT'S SO CONFUSING 'CAUSE IT WOULD'VE MADE MORE SENSE FOR A STRANGER TO KILL MY BROTHER THAN SOMEBODY TO HAVE MET HIM AND THEN DO IT AFTER MEETING EDDIE. YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY SEE HOW SWEET OF A PERSON HE IS. Wortman: MANUEL KILLED AS A THRILL KILLING. HE JUST WANTED TO HURT SOMEBODY. AND I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD'VE DONE IT AGAIN. Pelato: HIS MOTIVE WAS RAGE AND HIS DESIRE TO KILL. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A SERIAL KILLER IN THE MAKING. Narrator: MANUEL GUZMAN WILL NEVER BE RELEASED FROM PRISON. Epps: I CAN'T GET IN THE RING WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT EDDIE. [ SOBS ] UH, HE'S A BIG PART OF MY LIFE, AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE. Interpreter for Celia: IT WAS VERY PAINFUL FOR ME, BUT I FEEL THAT THEY SAID GOOD-BYE TO HIM AS HE DESERVED. Epps: AND THEN, WE ALL TOOK OUR NAME PLATES OFF AND TOSSED IT IN. IT JUST SEEMED UNREAL. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I HAD JUST BEEN SEEING HIM NOT LONG BEFORE THAT. AND EDDIE WAS, YOU KNOW, I MEAN... Gilbert: I NEED TO MAKE HIM PROUD. SO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO ME RIGHT NOW IS HELPING PEOPLE WHO NEED IT, JUST LIKE HE DID. AND -- AND THROUGH BOXING, I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY. Interpreter for Celia: EDDIE DIDN'T DESERVE TO HAVE A DEATH LIKE THAT. EDDIE NEVER HURT ANYBODY. HE RESPECTED EVERYBODY, AND EVERYBODY LIKED HIM. Gilbert: WITH MY BROTHER MURDERED AND MY DAD LOCKED AWAY SOMEWHERE, WE WEREN'T EVEN A FAMILY. Interpreter for Celia: EVEN TODAY, I -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MANUEL GUZMAN KILLED MY SON.
