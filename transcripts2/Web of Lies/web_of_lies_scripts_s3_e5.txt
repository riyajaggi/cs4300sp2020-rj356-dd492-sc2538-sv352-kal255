 I'M SO GLAD SCHOOL'S OVER. HEY, TY. AFTER SCHOOL SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME HANGING OUT WITH BEST FRIENDS HALEIGH AND TYLER-ANN. NICHOLE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. SHE WAS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE I EVER MET. SHE JUST MADE ME CRACK UP ALL THE TIME. SHE WAS FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY. KIDS THAT NOBODY WAS REALLY FRIENDS WITH, SHE WOULD GO OUT OF HER WAY TO BE NICE TO THEM. LIKE MOST TEENS IN TOWN, NICHOLE IS ADDICTED TO FACEBOOK. SHE KEEPS UP WITH THE GOSSIP AND SHARES SELFIES WITH HER FRIENDS. HONESTLY, SHE TOOK THE MOST SELFIES OUT OF ANYONE I'VE EVER KNOWN. AND, I MEAN, I DID YELL AT HER A COUPLE OF TIMES. I WAS LIKE, "PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY!" SCHOOL'S OVER, OH MY GOODNESS. NICHOLE'S PUBLIC POSTS AND PRETTY PROFILE PICTURE ATTRACT LOTS OF FRIEND REQUESTS. EVERY DAY SHE HAD SOMEONE NEW ADDING HER ON FACEBOOK. A LOCAL GUY NAMED KYLE DUBE ASKS TO FRIEND NICHOLE. SHE'S NEVER HEARD OF HIM. BUT HE LOOKS COOL. HE'S GOT A JOB AND HIS OWN TRUCK. HE MUST BE A COUPLE OF YEARS OLDER. NO, NO. I THINK I'LL ACCEPT THAT FRIEND REQUEST. HE'S NOT MY TYPE. DEFINITELY ALL FOR YOU. OH, HE MESSAGED ME. EXCUSE ME. NICHOLE'S MOM KRISTINE PICKS HER UP FROM SCHOOL EVERY DAY... - HI, MOM. - HEY. I'M GOING TO RIDE IN THE BACK TODAY. FOR THE 15-MINUTE DRIVE HOME TO GLENBURN, WHERE SHE LIVES WITH HER SISTERS AND STEP-DAD. SO HOW'S SCHOOL? IT WAS ALL RIGHT. SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT, SHE'D BE GIGGLING, LAUGHING. WE'D -- TALKING BACK AND FORTH. ARE ANY OF THE SUBJECTS EASIER THAN OTHERS? UH, YEAH, MATH IS ACTUALLY GOING REALLY WELL. GOOD. AND OF COURSE SHE'S, YOU KNOW, ON HER PHONE AND TEXTING AT THE SAME TIME. IT WAS LIKE YOU COULDN'T EVEN TELL SHE WAS TEXTING BECAUSE SHE WAS CARRYING A CONVERSATION RIGHT ALONG WITH YOU. ARE YOU GETTING READY FOR EXAMS? YEAH, THEY'RE COMING UP. IT'S BEEN 2 WEEKS SINCE NICHOLE STARTED TALKING TO KYLE DUBE ONLINE. AND NOW HE WANTS TO MEET UP. BUT NICHOLE'S MOM HAS STRICT RULES ABOUT INTERNET FRIENDS. HEY. HEY, JUST SEEING WHAT'S UP. OH, JUST DOING SOME HOMEWORK. GOT SOME JUICE, YOU WANT SOME? COOL. OKAY. NICHOLE ISN'T ALLOWED TO GO OUT WITH SOMEONE SHE ONLY KNOWS FROM THE INTERNET. I THINK SHE JUST THOUGHT I WAS BEING MEAN. AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD WHERE SHE WAS COMING FROM. I REMEMBER BEING A KID, BUT SHE'S MY KID. BUT NICHOLE IS DETERMINED TO MEET KYLE, EVEN IF IT MEANS LYING TO HER MOM. MOM! SHE WOULD GET VERY DEFENSIVE IF I TRIED TO LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER. I'M JUST CHECKING THE TIME. THAT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING. I'M GOING TO MEET HALEIGH TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL. OKAY. JUST LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED A RIDE HOME. - COOL. - OKAY. TEENAGERS -- OH MY GOODNESS -- THEY REBEL. AND THE MORE YOU PUSH, THE MORE THEY REBEL. NICHOLE FILLS HALEIGH IN ON THE PLAN AND GETS READY TO MEET KYLE FOR THE FIRST TIME. NICHOLE AND I -- WE WERE LIKE SISTERS, SO WE ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF EACH OTHER. SHE HAD MY BACK AND I HAD HER BACK THROUGH EVERYTHING. - YOU'RE SURE? - YEAH, AND HE SEEMS REALLY NICE. SO WHEN SHE MET KYLE, SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT. BEAUTIFUL. GO, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. HAVE FUN, BYE. IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME SHE'S MET UP WITH SOMEONE SHE'S ONLY MESSAGED ONLINE, BUT KYLE SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE SHE CAN TRUST. THAT WHOLE THERE WHERE, LIKE, YOUR PARENTS SAY, "STRANGER DANGER," IT'S REAL. BUT WE THOUGHT WE WERE INVINCIBLE. - HEY. - HEY. - NICHOLE? - KYLE? - HEY. - NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU. HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU TOO. - HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. - GOOD. - NICE TRUCK. THANKS, YEAH. IT'S COOL. YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK? - YEAH. - ALL RIGHT. THIS WAY. NICHOLE THINKS KYLE'S EVEN BETTER LOOKING IN PERSON, BUT OLDER THAN SHE WAS EXPECTING. SO HOW OLD ARE YOU? I'M 19, ALMOST 20. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. YEAH... I'M A DAD TOO. I HAVE A FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AT HOME. WOW. YEAH. IS HER MOM THERE? UH, NO, WE, UH, WE BROKE UP. UH, MY DAUGHTER LIVES AT HOME WITH ME. THE MOM HELPS TO BABYSIT BECAUSE I'M OUT OF THE HOUSE A LOT, I WORK MOST NIGHTS. BUT, UH, I'M KIND OF LIKE A CARE WORKER FOR OLD PEOPLE. - THAT'S PRETTY COOL. - YEAH. NICHOLE LOVES THAT KYLE IS SO MATURE AND IS TAKING FATHERHOOD SERIOUSLY. SHE WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM, BUT SHE'LL HAVE TO WAIT. UH, MY MOM WANTS TO KNOW WHAT TIME SHE SHOULD PICK ME UP. UM, I COULD PROBABLY GIVE YOU A RIDE IF YOU LIKE? - COOL. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE THEN. KYLE MAKES THE SHORT DRIVE TO NICHOLE'S HOUSE. HE PARKS ON THE MAIN ROAD SO THEY DON'T GET CAUGHT AND WAITS UNTIL NICHOLE IS SAFELY INSIDE. HEY, TY. NICHOLE HAS A HUGE CRUSH ON KYLE ALREADY... AND CAN'T WAIT TO TELL HER FRIENDS. HE LOOKS LIKE A GROWN-UP. NICHOLE TOLD ME THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS FUNNY. HE WAS MATURE, LIKE, HE WASN'T LIKE THOSE KIDS IN OUR CLASS. AND HE HAS A TRUCK. HE HAD A CAR, HE HAD A JOB. SO HE WAS ALMOST LIKE A FULL-GROWN MAN AT THIS POINT AND THAT'S WHAT SHE REALLY WANTED. OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. BYE. KYLE SEEMS SERIOUS ABOUT NICHOLE. MOM? MEETING KYLE'S DAUGHTER IS A HUGE DEAL AND NICHOLE CAN'T KEEP HIM A SECRET ANY LONGER. CAN I GO FOR A RIDE WITH A FRIEND, HE'S GOING TO PICK ME UP. NICHOLE HAD ASKED IF SHE COULD GO FOR A RIDE WITH THIS BOY. - BOYFRIEND? - NO. HE'S JUST -- HE'S 17, SO HE CAN DRIVE. SHE HAD SAID HE WAS 17 AND HIS NAME WAS KYLE AND THEY WERE JUST FRIENDS. OKAY, BUT YOU KNOW THE HOUSE RULES. - YUP, YUP. - HE'S GOT TO COME IN. I KNOW. AND WE SAID, "WELL, HE'S GOT TO COME IN, WE HAVE TO MEET HIM BEFORE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE WITH HIM." AS NICHOLE CONFIRMS THE DATE, AN UNEXPECTED MESSAGE COMES THROUGH. SOMEONE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT'S UP BETWEEN HER AND KYLE. BUT IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE'S BEEN JEALOUS OF HER. SORRY ABOUT THIS, BUT DO YOU MIND COMING INSIDE AND MEETING MY MOM? NO, I DON'T MIND. AWESOME. NICHOLE THINKS HER MOM WILL BUY HER STORY ABOUT KYLE'S AGE, BUT HER STEP-DAD MIGHT BE HARDER TO CONVINCE. NICHOLE'S MOM, KRISTINE, MARRIED JASON WILEY FOUR YEARS AFTER SPLITTING FROM NICHOLE'S DAD IN 2002, WHEN NICHOLE WAS JUST FIVE. WHEN HE CAME IN, I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF CLEANING MY 9 MILLIMETER GUN. AND I SAID, "HEY, KYLE. COME HERE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING." YOU EVER SEEN ONE OF THESE THINGS? AND I SHOWED HIM THE GUN... YEAH, IT'S A 9 MIL. AND I SAID TO HIM, "JUST SO YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OF DOING ANYTHING OTHER THAN FRIENDS THAT THIS IS HERE ON THE TABLE." UNDERSTOOD? UNDERSTOOD. JUST TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I'M A CARING STEP-FATHER. ALL RIGHT. HEY, SO KYLE, HOW OLD ARE YOU? HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE'S LIKE, "UM"... UM, 18. IT WAS MORE LIKE A QUESTION, NOT A STATEMENT. KRISTINE ISN'T CONVINCED, SHE KNOWS KYLE IS HIDING SOMETHING... - LET'S GO IN HERE. - ALL RIGHT. BUT DECIDES TO PUT HER DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS FIRST. MY WIFE SAID, "WELL, GEEZ, WE NEED TO TRUST HER, WE NEED TO GIVE HER A LITTLE BIT OF FREEDOM." SO WE MADE THE DECISION TO LET HER GO. IT'S A 20-MINUTE DRIVE TO KYLE'S HOUSE IN ORONO, AND NICHOLE CANNOT WAIT TO MEET HIS DAUGHTER. SHE WENT AND HUNG OUT WITH KYLE AT HIS HOUSE. JUST, UH, CHILL OUT HERE, UH, I'LL GO GET HER. AND HE HAD A DAUGHTER NAMED SAVANNAH AND SHE WAS LIKE FOUR AT THE TIME. - AND THIS IS NICHOLE. - HI THERE. THIS IS MY FRIEND. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. THIS IS SAVANNAH. SHE'S SO CUTE. SHE ABSOLUTELY ADORED SAVANNAH. PRETTY HAIR. AND SAVANNAH WAS RIGHT IN LOVE WITH NICHOLE. - LET'S GO ON THE SWING. - THAT SOUNDS FUN. NICHOLE IS HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME WITH KYLE AND HIS DAUGHTER, WHEN SUDDENLY... HEY, UH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET GOING? - WHY? - UM, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET -- UH, THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND. - WHO THE HELL IS SHE? - WHAT? IT'S COOL SARAH. SARAH. YEAH, THE HELL IT'S COOL. I THOUGHT KYLE DUBE WAS THE ONE I HAD TO WORRY ABOUT HER SEEING, HOW WRONG WAS I? JUST A WEEK AFTER MEETING 19-YEAR-OLD KYLE DUBE ONLINE, NICHOLE IS EXCITED ABOUT BECOMING HIS GIRLFRIEND. THIS IS SAVANNAH. BUT SHE'S SHOCKED TO DISCOVER HE ALREADY HAS ONE. UM, NO, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET -- THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND. - WHO THE HELL IS SHE? - WHAT? IT'S COOL, SARAH. SARAH. - YEAH, THE HELL IT'S COOL. - I KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT, DON'T -- DON'T SWEAR IN FRONT OF SAVANNAH, OKAY, I TOLD YOU A MILLION TIMES. SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD SARAH MASON HAS BEEN DATING KYLE ON AND OFF FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND SHE HAS A FIERCE REPUTATION. NICHOLE IS DEVASTATED THAT KYLE LED HER ON AND IT GETS WORSE. NEWS OF WHAT HAPPENED SPREADS ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA. WHAT'S GOING ON? NOTHING. NICHOLE WAS SITTING ON THE COUCH AND SHE WAS TEXTING ON HER CELL PHONE. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE NOTHING. I JUST SAID, "WHAT -- YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING ON, WHAT'S WRONG?" SHE LOOKED UPSET. I'M JUST MAD AT KYLE. AND I SAID, "WHY?" HE JUST LIED TO ME, HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND AND THEN HE DOES. KYLE'S GIRLFRIEND, SARAH, IS SEETHING WITH ANGER AND WANTS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. KYLE'S GIRLFRIEND WAS MESSAGING NICHOLE AND ASKING TO SEE TEXT MESSAGES AND PRIVATE MESSAGES BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M FINE. SARAH'S MAD BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT KYLE WAS CHEATING ON HER. AND NICHOLE WAS UPSET WITH KYLE BECAUSE KYLE LIED TO HER. NICHOLE STOPS TEXTING KYLE AND HOPES SARAH WILL CALM DOWN WHEN SHE FIGURES OUT NOTHING HAPPENED. SHE NEEDS A DISTRACTION... AND SOMEONE NEW TO TALK TO. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OFFERS, BUT ONE WHICH STANDS OUT. BRYAN BUTTERFIELD RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM NICHOLE'S HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS IN COMMON. HE IS ALSO SERIOUSLY CUTE. IT IS EXACTLY WHAT NICHOLE NEEDS AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH KYLE. UH, EVERYONE CAN SLEEP OVER. - SOME S'MORES. - WORKING ON MY MOM TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT I CAN INVITE. OH, BY THE WAY, DID I TELL YOU THIS CUTIE ADDED ME ON FACEBOOK. NICHOLE SHOWED ME HIS PICTURE AND WE WERE BOTH THINKING ABOUT HOW IT WAS REALLY STRANGE THAT IT WAS LIKE A SURFER WITH A SURFBOARD, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE LIVE IN MAINE. BUT HE WAS PRETTY CUTE, TO BE HONEST. HE HAD, LIKE, LONG, BLONDE, CURLY SURFER HAIR. - HE'S HOT. - YEAH, MORE YOUR TYPE? HE WAS HOT. HE WAS HOT. HE'S VERY HOT. ARE YOU GOING TO MESSAGE HIM? YEAH, WE'VE ALREADY BEEN CHATTING. - I HAVE TO GO, LADIES. - ALL RIGHT. - HAVE A GOOD ONE. - BYE. BYE. WITH NEW GUY, BRYAN, ON THE SCENE, NICHOLE FORGETS ALL ABOUT KYLE. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS MOVING ON SO FAST. SARAH'S HATE FOR NICHOLE RUNS DEEP. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M FINE. IT'S SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND BRYAN BUTTERFIELD SENDS AN INVITATION. FINALLY, SHE'LL GET TO MEET HER MYSTERY MAN. MOM. YEAH? CAN I GO TO A PARTY TONIGHT? MY FRIEND CAN GIVE ME A RIDE. NICHOLE HAD ASKED IF SHE COULD GO TO A PARTY WITH A FRIEND. DO I KNOW THEM? UM, NO, DO YOU HAVE TO MEET HIM? ABSOLUTELY. YOU CAN KIND OF JUDGE PEOPLE BETTER THAT WAY. OKAY, I'LL LET HIM KNOW. NICHOLE IS DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS DATE A SUCCESS -- A PARTY IN A FANCY PART OF TOWN CALLS FOR EXTRA EFFORT. SHE WAS PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT GOING. I THINK SHE CHANGED HER HAIR LIKE THREE OR FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT. SHE'S A KID, SHE'S A TEENAGER, THEY WANT TO GO AND HAVE FUN. BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. BRYAN'S LOST AND RUNNING LATE FOR THE PARTY. NICHOLE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S TOO EMBARRASSING FOR HER PARENTS TO TAKE HER TO THE PARTY, BUT THERE IS ONE ALTERNATIVE, KYLE DUBE. NOW THAT NICHOLE IS MORE INTERESTED IN BRYAN, SHE LETS KYLE OFF THE HOOK FOR LYING HER ABOUT HAVING A GIRLFRIEND IN RETURN FOR A SMALL FAVOR. THINGS ARE FINALLY FALLING INTO PLACE. NICHOLE HAS A REALLY GOOD FEELING ABOUT BRYAN. KYLE PICKS NICHOLE UP AT 9 P.M. THANKS FOR PICKING ME UP. YEAH, SURE. BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE THEY RUN INTO TROUBLE. AS THEY DROVE DOWN THE ROAD, THIS LAKE ROAD, THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND BRYAN. AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND THE PARTY. NICHOLE REACHED OUT VIA TEXT MESSAGE ASKING, "WHERE ARE YOU?" AND HE DIDN'T RESPOND. LET'S FORGET IT. NO WAY. JUST PULL OVER. DETERMINED TO FIND BRYAN, NICHOLE HEADS TOWARDS THE LAKE ALONE TO LOOK FOR THE PARTY. MEANWHILE, KYLE'S GIRLFRIEND, SARAH, SEEMS TO KNOW THAT KYLE ISN'T JUST OUT ON HIS OWN. HEY, BABY. NO, NOBODY. HELLO? HELLO? NICHOLE CABLE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING HER NEW FACEBOOK FRIEND, BRYAN BUTTERFIELD, AT AN EXCLUSIVE PARTY ON PUSHAW LAKE IN OLD TOWN, MAINE. BUT AFTER GETTING LOST ALONG THE WAY, SHE FINDS HERSELF IN THE DARK, DEEP INTO THE WOODS. HELLO? AH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. I JUST THOUGHT YOU GOT LOST. COME ON, LET'S GO. WITH NO SIGN OF THE PARTY, THERE'S NO OPTION BUT TO TURN BACK. MEETING BRYAN BUTTERFIELD WILL HAVE TO WAIT. THE NEXT MORNING, IT'S MOTHER'S DAY. NICHOLE REFUSES TO LET SARAH'S HOSTILITY SPOIL THE OCCASION. MOM? I HAD WOKE UP TO NICHOLE COMING INTO MY ROOM... HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY. AND SHE HAD MADE ME A CARD WITH CONSTRUCTION PAPER THAT SAID, "HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY" AND WITH A HEART AND A FLOWER ON THE FRONT. THIS IS SO SWEET. I THINK THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME NICHOLE MADE ME A CARD. THANK YOU. - I LOVE YOU, MOM. - I LOVE YOU, TOO. THAT WAS DEFINITELY A -- A SPECIAL GIFT. NICHOLE CAN'T GET BRYAN OUT OF HER MIND. SHE HOPES HE DIDN'T DITCH HER ON PURPOSE. NICHOLE'S RELIEVED THAT BRYAN STILL WANTS TO MET UP. AND SINCE BRYAN'S COMING TO HER, THERE'S NO CHANCE OF THINGS GOING WRONG THIS TIME. ANOTHER MESSAGE COMES THROUGH. IT'S KYLE. AS NICHOLE IS MEETING BRYAN ALONE, THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANY RETRIBUTION FROM KYLE'S GIRLFRIEND, SARAH. ALL SHE NEEDS TO DO NOW... - HEY, HON. - IS GET PAST HER MOM. I'M EXHAUSTED, I'LL BE IN MY ROOM, OKAY? - OKAY, GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT. WITH HER MOM IN BED, IT'S EASY FOR NICHOLE TO SNEAK OUT. EVERYTHING IS READY, SHE IS FINALLY GOING TO MEET BRYAN FACE TO FACE. THE DRIVEWAY IS PITCH BLACK, SO NICHOLE MAKES SURE TO STAND WHERE SHE CAN BE SEEN. NO! WE WOKE UP AT LIKE QUARTER AFTER SEVEN, WHICH IS REALLY LATE, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT TIME NICHOLE AND I NEED TO BE LEAVING THE HOUSE. I WENT OUT INTO THE LIVING ROOM, NO TV ON. NICHOLE? IT WAS SO QUIET. NICHOLE? NICHOLE? AND I SAID, "JASON, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, NICHOLE'S NOT HERE, NICHOLE'S GONE." MAYBE SHE'S OUT FRONT. DID YOU EVEN LOOK OUTSIDE? NO. WHILE HE'S LOOKING OUTSIDE, I'M CALLING HER CELL PHONE. AND IT'S JUST GOING RIGHT TO VOICEMAIL. I CALLED HER BEST FRIEND, HALEIGH. HALEIGH! HALEIGH, DID YOU TALK TO NICHOLE LAST NIGHT? NICHOLE WOULD TEXT ME WHETHER SHE WAS STAYING AT SOMEONE'S HOUSE OR IF SHE GOT HOME. BUT THAT'S WHY I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T CALL ME AND TELL ME TO COVER FOR HER. AND THAT WAS THE FIRST I KNEW OF BRYAN BUTTERFIELD. HALEIGH WANTS TO KNOW IF THE MEETING BETWEEN BRYAN AND NICHOLE FINALLY HAPPENED. I WENT ON FACEBOOK TO ASK HIM WHERE NICHOLE WAS... AND IT WAS JUST DELETED, LIKE -- LIKE IT WAS NEVER EVER EVEN THERE. THE CUTE SURFER GUY DIDN'T EXIST. I CALLED HALEIGH BACK AND I SAID, "HAVE YOU GOTTEN AHOLD OF HIM? NO, HIS FACEBOOK IS GONE. AND I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S GONE?" SHE GOES, "HIS FACEBOOK IS GONE." WE DO HAVE TO WORRY. MY STOMACH JUST TURNED. KRISTINE HAS HEARD ENOUGH. SHE PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS 911. MY DAUGHTER WENT OUT LAST NIGHT AND SHE MET SOMEBODY AND SHE DIDN'T COME HOME. WHEN WE FIRST REPORTED THIS, THE POLICE SAID, "THIS KIND OF STUFF DOESN'T HAPPEN IN MAINE. UH, JUST WAIT AND SHE'LL BE HOME." NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND WE ARGUED WITH THE OFFICER SAYING, "LISTEN, THIS IS NOT LIKE HER. THIS KID DOES NOT TURN HER PHONE OFF. SHE WOULD ANSWER US EVEN IF IT WAS TO TELL US TO GO TO HELL." I SAID, "WHAT DO I DO? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?" OFFICERS TELL KRISTINE TO SIT TIGHT AND WAIT FOR NICHOLE TO SHOW UP. BUT KRISTINE KNOWS THERE'S NO WAY HER DAUGHTER WOULD BE OFF HER CELL PHONE FOR ALMOST 12 HOURS. I GOT OFF THE PHONE AND I IMMEDIATELY TOOK SOME PHOTOS OF PHOTOS THAT I HAD OF NICHOLE AND I MADE A POSTER. WE TRIED GETTING THEM OUT THERE EVERYWHERE WE COULD. WE WANTED NICHOLE TO COME HOME. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR KRISTINE'S POSTERS TO SPREAD ACROSS TOWN, INSPIRING THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TO JOIN THE SEARCH. EVERYWHERE YOU WENT YOU COULD SEE WHERE THEIR FLYERS WERE. THEY WERE JUST -- FLOODED THE TOWN. WITH NICHOLE NOW MISSING FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS AND THE TOWN UP IN ARMS, THE POLICE TAKE ACTION. WE HAD THE POLICE COME OUT AND SPEAK WITH US. AND THEY SAID, "THIS IS SERIOUS." HI, HALEIGH. HALEIGH TELLS THE DETECTIVES EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE GUY THAT SHE ARRANGED TO MEET LAST NIGHT. UM, I KNOW THAT HIS NAME IS BRYAN BUTTERFIELD AND THAT THEY MET ON-- ONLINE ON FACEBOOK. THE DEPUTY AT THAT TIME ALSO SPOKE AT LENGTH WITH HALEIGH TO DETERMINE WHO BRYAN BUTTERFIELD WAS. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE, WHERE HE MIGHT LIVE? UM, SHE SENT ME HIS PHOTO. THAT'S ALL I HAVE. TO POLICE, EVERYTHING SUGGESTS THE BRYAN BUTTERFIELD FACEBOOK ACCOUNT IS A FAKE. BUT THEY NEED TO BE SURE. SO THEY RUN A SEARCH FOR ANYONE BY THAT NAME. WE'RE GOING TO CHECK OUT THESE RECORDS HERE, OKAY? THE DEPUTY THEN CHECKS SOME RECORDS AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE NAMED BRYAN BUTTERFIELD. CAN YOU GET ME AN ADDRESS FOR BRYAN BUTTERFIELD? AND HE LIVES 15 MINUTES AWAY, JUST OUTSIDE BANGOR, MAINE. DETECTIVES HEAD TO BRYAN BUTTERFIELD'S HOUSE. THEY HOPE THEY'RE NOT TOO LATE. I'M LOOKING FOR BRYAN BUTTERFIELD. NO ONE HAS SEEN NICHOLE CABLE SINCE SHE LEFT HER HOUSE ON MOTHER'S DAY TO MEET HER ONLINE SURFER BOYFRIEND, BRYAN BUTTERFIELD. DETECTIVES RACE TO BUTTERFIELD'S DOORSTEP IN DOWNTOWN BANGOR. I'M LOOKING FOR BRYAN BUTTERFIELD. THAT'S ME, CAN I HELP? THE BRYAN BUTTERFIELD THAT THE DEPUTY WAS SPEAKING TO LOOKED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THE BRYAN BUTTERFIELD THAT NICHOLE HAD BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH. MIND IF I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? NO, COME IN. THERE WAS NO RESEMBLANCE WHATSOEVER. YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER? NO, GO AHEAD. YOU CAN TELL SOMETIMES WHEN SOMEONE HAS NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BRYAN BUTTERFIELD KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO AND ABOUT HIS COMMUNICATION WITH NICHOLE. BUT DESPITE LOOKING DIFFERENT, A LOT OF HIS DETAILS MATCHED THE ONLINE PROFILE THAT NICHOLE HAD SHOWN HER FRIEND HALEIGH. BOTH LIVE IN BANGOR, BOTH WENT TO OLD TOWN HIGH SCHOOL AND BOTH ARE 18. WHOEVER SET UP THE FAKE PROFILE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE REAL BRYAN. CAN YOU THINK OF ANYBODY THAT WOULD WANT TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE? YEAH, ACTUALLY. THERE'S AN EX-GIRLFRIEND. SHE'S BEEN MAKING LIFE HELL RECENTLY. YEAH? WHAT'S HER NAME? SARAH. SARAH MASON. BRYAN TOLD THE DEPUTY THAT HE AND SARAH HAD DATED FOR A WHILE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND HER? SHE LIVES IN ORONO WITH HER NEW BOYFRIEND, SOME GUY NAMED KYLE DUBE. DETECTIVES HEAD STRAIGHT OVER TO KYLE DUBE'S HOUSE IN NEARBY ORONO. THEY WANT TO KNOW IF SARAH IS BEHIND THE FAKE FACEBOOK ACCOUNT. EXCUSE ME, SIR. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? LOOKING TO SPEAK TO SARAH MASON, IS SHE IN? UH, NO. I'M NOT EXPECTING HER BACK UNTIL THIS EVENING. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO HER FOR? HERE'S MY CARD. CAN YOU ASK HER TO CALL ME WHEN SHE GETS BACK? YEAH, SURE. OKAY, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE. AS INVESTIGATORS WAIT FOR SARAH, NICHOLE'S COMPUTER IS ANALYZED TO SEE IF HER ONLINE ACTIVITY CAN HELP EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. IF YOU HAVE COMPUTER ISSUES IN PART OF YOUR INVESTIGATION, BRENT BOLEO AT COMPUTER CRIMES TASK FORCE, HE'S THE ONE YOU WANT TO TALK TO. DETECTIVE BOLEO CONTACTED FACEBOOK AND U.S. CELLULAR. AND THROUGH SUBPOENAS AND SEARCH WARRANTS WE'RE ABLE TO TRACK DOWN THE TEXT MESSAGES THAT HAD BEEN EXCHANGED BETWEEN NICHOLE AND BRYAN BUTTERFIELD. AND REALIZED THAT NICHOLE HAD NOT SENT ANY MESSAGES OR MADE ANY CALLS SINCE THE 12th. IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS SINCE NICHOLE HAS USED HER CELL PHONE. FEARING FOUL PLAY, POLICE LAUNCH A GROUND SEARCH FOR THE 15 YEAR OLD. OUR ROAD WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF. THE POLICE HAD CRIME SCENE TAPE ON THE ROAD THAT ADJOINS TO OURS. THEY HAD CAMERAS, THEY WERE TAKING PICTURES. THERE WAS A WOOD LINE THAT RAN ALONG THE DRIVEWAY AND THEY FIND ARTICLES THAT SEEMED OUT OF PLACE. I LOOK UP AND I SEE ONE OF NICHOLE'S SOCKS. AND HER SHOES. MY HUSBAND'S TRYING TO TELL ME, "WELL, WE JUST THREW A BUNCH OF CLOTHES OUT LAST WEEK, IT COULD'VE BEEN BIRDS TAKING IT AWAY." THEN OFFICERS FIND SOMETHING HALF-HIDDEN IN THE UNDERGROWTH. THERE WAS A SKI MASK THAT WAS FOUND IN THAT WOODED AREA. UNLIKE THE OTHER ITEMS, THE SKI MASK DOESN'T BELONG TO NICHOLE. IN THE WARM MONTH OF MAY, THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON TO WEAR A MASK, TO HIDE HIS OR HER IDENTITY. THEY BAG IT FOR DNA ANALYSIS. DETECTIVES NOW FEAR NICHOLE'S BEEN ABDUCTED. IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FIND HER ALIVE, THEY HAVE TO FIND HER QUICKLY. LAW ENFORCEMENT THROWS EVERYTHING THEY'VE GOT INTO A SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION. THERE WERE MULTIPLE AGENCIES INVOLVED. DOGS FROM THE MAINE STATE POLICE. AND A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL ASSIST WITH THE SEARCH. THEY DO IT GRID BY GRID. THEY HAD PLANES UP TRYING TO LOOK THROUGH THE WOODS. EVERYONE IN THE STATE WAS TOGETHER LOOKING FOR HER. THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS SCOUR THE VAST WOODLAND AREA FOR ANY SIGN OF NICHOLE... WE WERE JUST WAITING, WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO FIND SOMETHING TO TELL US, LIKE, SHE'S OKAY. UNTIL FINALLY THEY MAKE A DISCOVERY. THEY WENT UP SO FAR AS ABOUT 10 MILES... AND FOUND NICHOLE'S SWEATSHIRT. TATTERED, RIPPED DOWN THE CENTER, AND WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS QUITE A STRUGGLE. I WAS -- I WAS SCARED OUT OF MY MIND. AS HOPES OF FINDING NICHOLE ALIVE START TO FADE, SARAH MASON COMES FORWARD. THANKS FOR COMING IN, SARAH. I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU, OKAY? WORD HAS SPREAD ABOUT HOW MUCH SARAH DISLIKES NICHOLE. SHE'S DISGUSTING. SHE HAS BEEN HEARD MAKING THREATS AGAINST HER. IF I SEE HER AROUND, SHE'S DEAD. BUT DID SHE EVER ACT ON THEM? WHERE WERE YOU ON SUNDAY NIGHT? I WAS AT MY MOM'S HOUSE, YOU CAN CHECK. DO YOU OFTEN USE THE COMPUTER AT KYLE'S? YEAH, SOMETIMES. SARAH IS ICE COLD, BUT CAN SHE KEEP HER COMPOSURE? KYLE LIKES NICHOLE, DOESN'T HE? I MEAN, IT'S OBVIOUS BY THE WAY HE BEHAVES, THAT THEY'RE AN ITEM. IT'S NOT TRUE, IF IT WAS, I WOULD KILL HIM. THE OUTBURST EXPOSES SARAH'S SINISTER SIDE. BUT INVESTIGATORS NEED HARD EVIDENCE BEFORE THEY CAN MAKE THEIR MOVE. AS THEY CHECK OUT HER ALIBI, ANALYSIS OF THE FAKE BRYAN PROFILE HITS THEIR DESK. THEY WERE ABLE TO TRACE THE IP ADDRESS. IS THIS THE ADDRESS THE BRYAN BUTTERFIELD ACCOUNT TRACES BACK TO? GOOD WORK MAN, GOOD WORK. THE ACCOUNT ORIGINATES FROM KYLE DUBE'S HOUSE, WHERE SARAH HAS ACCESS TO THE COMPUTER. DETECTIVES ARE CLOSING IN UNTIL NEWS OF HER ALIBI COMES THROUGH. SARAH WAS ABLE TO BE RULED OUT BECAUSE SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER ON MOTHER'S DAY. BUT THE RESULTS ARE CLEAR -- THE BRYAN BUTTERFIELD ACCOUNT WAS CREATED AT KYLE'S HOUSE. AND AT THAT POINT THE INVESTIGATION TOOK A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TURN. ALMOST A WEEK AFTER NICHOLE CABLE DISAPPEARED FROM HER HOME IN GLENBURN, MAINE. INVESTIGATORS DISCOVER THE CREATOR OF THE FAKE FACEBOOK PROFILE SHE WAS COMMUNICATING WITH JUST BEFORE SHE VANISHED. DETECTIVE BOLEO TRACED THE BRYAN BUTTERFIELD ACCOUNT TO KYLE DUBE. DETECTIVES HAVE PROOF THAT IT WAS KYLE'S SMART PHONE THAT COMMUNICATED WITH NICHOLE ON THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT KYLE HAS ABDUCTED NICHOLE, BUT DETECTIVES NEED A CONFESSION. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, HE IS BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING. DETECTIVES START BY SCRUTINIZING HIS MOVEMENTS THE NIGHT NICHOLE WENT MISSING. KYLE SAID THAT HE PICKED UP HIS GIRLFRIEND SARAH AT HER HOUSE APPROXIMATELY 11:00 ON THE NIGHT OF THE 12th. BUT CELL PHONE RECORDS INDICATED THAT HE HAD LEFT WORK SOMETIME BETWEEN 8:00 AND 9:00 AND WERE IN THE OLD TOWN AREA BETWEEN 9:00 AND 11:00. WHAT KYLE WAS TELLING THEM WASN'T TRUE. BUT KYLE IS STEADFAST IN HIS DENIAL. ONLY THEN DO THE DETECTIVES PLAY THEIR TRUMP CARD. AT THE VERY END OF THE INTERVIEW THEY SHOWED HIM THE MASK. THE DNA ON THE MASK MATCHES A SAMPLE POLICE ALREADY HAVE ON RECORD FOR KYLE. NOW DETECTIVES DESPERATELY NEED HIM TO LEAD THEM TO NICHOLE, DEAD OR ALIVE. THEY GET NOTHING FROM KYLE. BUT AFTER HE IS RELEASED TO HIS FAMILY, HE MAKES A SHOCKING ADMISSION. KYLE ADMITTED TO SARAH THAT HE HAD KILLED NICHOLE. AND HE TOLD HER WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH NICHOLE'S BODY AND WHERE THE BODY WAS LOCATED. STUNNED BY THE INFORMATION, SARAH GIVES KYLE UP, AND A SEARCH TEAM IS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO FIND NICHOLE. GAME WARDENS AND DETECTIVES WENT TO THAT LOCATION. THEY FOUND AN UNUSUAL-LOOKING MOUND COVERED WITH LEAVES, TWIGS AND BRANCHES. AND THAT'S WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD FOUND NICHOLE CABLE AT LAST. NICHOLE'S BODY IS UNCOVERED 10 MILES FROM HER HOME, BY THE RIVER IN OLD TOWN, 8 DAYS AFTER SHE WENT MISSING. NOW ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FOR INVESTIGATORS TO BREAK THE NEWS TO HER FAMILY. JASON HAD GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE POLICE... THE POLICE ARE OUTSIDE, OKAY? HE WENT OUT AND TALKED WITH THEM. THEY HAD COME UP AND JASON HAD PUT HIS ARM AROUND ME. AND I LOOKED AT THEM. AND I SAID, "DID YOU FIND HER?" AND THEY JUST NODDED. BUT THE WAY -- THE WAY THEY NODDED, I KNEW. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. KYLE DUBE IS CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING AND FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, TO WHICH HE PLEADS NOT GUILTY. DURING HIS TRIAL, THE FULL STORY IS REVEALED. AFTER NICHOLE FOUND OUT ABOUT SARAH, SHE ENDED ANY HOPE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH KYLE. BUT KYLE COULDN'T LET NICHOLE GO AND BECAME OBSESSED WITH HAVING HER. POSING AS BRYAN, HE LURES HER OUT OF HER HOME. HE WAS GOING TO HIDE HER AND THEN JOIN THE SEARCH PARTY AS HIMSELF. HE WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE TO FIND HER SO HE COULD BE THE HERO. BUT HIS PLAN GOES WRONG. STOP! STOP! HE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT NICHOLE WAS GOING TO FIGHT FOR HER LIFE AS MUCH AS SHE DID. ONCE SHE RIPPED THE MASK OFF AND SHE KNEW IT WAS HIM, HE HAD TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT. AND HE ENDED UP KILLING HER WHEN HE PROBABLY JUST HAD THE INTENT TO RAPE HER. KYLE DUBE IS FOUND GUILTY OF BOTH CHARGES AND IS SENTENCED TO 60 YEARS IN PRISON. IT'S JUSTICE FOR NICHOLE'S FAMILY. BUT NOTHING WILL BRING HER BACK. NICHOLE'S BEDROOM IS A TYPICAL GIRL'S ROOM. HER LITTLE SISTERS WANT TO GO IN THERE. I THINK IT MAKES THEM FEEL CLOSE TO HER. BUT I COULDN'T HAVE THEM TOUCHING ALL HER STUFF AND RUINING HER THINGS. SO I ASKED MY HUSBAND TO SCREW HER BEDROOM DOOR SHUT. I BASICALLY LOST EVERYTHING THE DAY SHE DIED. I LAID IN BED IN CRIED. I DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO HARD. SHE WAS ON THE VERGE OF A WONDERFUL LIFE AND SHE HAD IT SNATCHED AWAY. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
