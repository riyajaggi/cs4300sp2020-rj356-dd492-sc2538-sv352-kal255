 Narrator: ON THE DARK SIDE OF CYBERSPACE... YOU HAVE TO STOP. ...OR MUCH CLOSER TO HOME? HELP ME! Narrator: THE QUIET, UPSCALE SUBURB OF LAURELHURST. WITH ITS LEAFY STREETS AND SPACIOUS HOUSES, IT'S ONE OF PORTLAND'S MOST DESIRABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. 59-YEAR-OLD BARRY HORNSTEIN IS STILL GETTING USED TO LIFE WITHOUT HIS WIFE, KATHY. THEY'VE RECENTLY SEPARATED AFTER NEARLY 20 YEARS OF MOSTLY HAPPY MARRIAGE. Barry: I DID NOT WANT TO BE SEPARATED FROM KATHY, BUT I HAD DONE SOME THINGS IN MY LIFE... THEY WEREN'T ILLEGAL...

 BUT THEY WEREN'T POSITIVE FOR THE FAMILY. [ METAL MUSIC PLAYS, KNOCK ON DOOR ] Barry: JACK! TIME TO GET UP. WAY AHEAD OF YA, POP. Narrator: 17-YEAR-OLD JACK SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME AT BARRY'S. Jack: I DIDN'T REALLY CHOOSE TO STAY AT MY DAD'S. I THINK MY SISTER WAS LIVING MORE WITH MY MOM, SO I WOULD PROBABLY TEND TO STAY MORE AT MY DAD'S. Narrator: LIKE MILLIONS OF TEENAGERS, JACK SPENDS ALL HIS SPARE TIME ONLINE, MAINLY CHATTING WITH HIS LONG-DISTANCE GIRLFRIEND, CINDY. Jack: I HAD MET CINDY AT THE BEACH THAT SUMMER. WE HAD NORMAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TYPICAL TEENAGE STUFF. Barry: JACK WAS GOOD. I MEAN, HE WASN'T INTO THE DRUGS. I THINK HE WAS WHAT I CALL AVERAGE. Jack: MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FATHER IS NORMAL. YOU KNOW, HE'D COME SUPPORT MY FOOTBALL GAME. DAD, NO MILK... AGAIN. LIVED A DECENT LIFE AND WHATNOT. HAVE A GOOD DAY. [ DOOR CLOSES ] Narrator: LIKE MANY FATHERS AND SONS, BARRY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE AND JACK HAVE THEIR UPS AND DOWNS. HE WASN'T PERFECT, BUT NO ONE IS. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] BUT FOR THE MOST PART, NO PROBLEMS THAT I COULD SEE. Narrator: THAT WEDNESDAY, JUST AFTER 8:00 A.M., JACK HEADS TO SCHOOL. AT ROUGHLY 10:00 IN THE MORNING, I LEFT THE HOUSE TO GO WORK. AND I OPENED THE DOOR, PUT MY BRIEFCASE IN. I LOOKED BEHIND MY CAR, AND I SAW SOMETHING IN THE DRIVEWAY. "THAT'S ODD. THE HECK IS THAT?" IT WAS, LIKE, A CYLINDER WRAPPED WITH BLACK TAPE. I WAS GOING TO PICK IT UP. BUT I DID NOT. I JUST DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS, SO I DECIDED TO KICK IT. [ HIGH-PITCHED RINGING ] ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT SEEMED LIKE THE WORLD STOPPED. [ COUGHS ] HELP. - [ CAR ALARM BLARING ] - HELP ME! [ DOG BARKS ] HELP ME! WHILE I WAS LAYING ON THE GROUND... [ CAR ALARM, DOG BARKING CONTINUES ] ...I LOOK AT MY LEG. THERE WAS LOTS OF BLOOD. MY PANTS ARE SHREDDED. I REALIZE I'VE BEEN BOMBED. Narrator: BARRY NEEDS URGENT TREATMENT. HELP ME. HURRY. AN AMBULANCE. BOY, YOU... YOU THINK, "IS THIS THE END OF IT ALL?" HURRY. [ SIGHS ] [ SIREN WAILS ] [ MONITOR BEEPING ] MORE PRESSURE. PUT PRESSURE. TOURNIQUET. Narrator: DOCTORS WORK FURIOUSLY TO STEM THE BLEEDING. FEEL THIS, SIR? I WAS HAVING... I WAS NOT REALLY FEELING ANYTHING. Narrator: THE BONES IN BARRY'S LOWER RIGHT LEG HAVE BEEN SHATTERED, AND THE MUSCULAR TISSUE BLOWN AWAY. MORE PRESSURE. MORE PRESSURE. HI. I'M LOOKING FOR THE E.R. DETECTIVE BILL LAW IS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THE EXPLOSION. Law: WE NEEDED TO ESTABLISH INFORMATION QUICKLY BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY, I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS GOING TO SURVIVE THIS. MR. HORNSTEIN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THIS TO YOU? I HAD NO IDEA WHY ANYONE WOULD PUT A BOMB IN MY DRIVEWAY OR ANYONE ELSE'S. OKAY. WE'LL BE BACK. Law: INITIALLY, I WAS WONDERING WHETHER MR. HORNSTEIN HAD DONE SOMETHING TO SOMEONE AND THIS WAS A RETALIATION OR THIS WAS SOME KIND OF A PRANK THAT HAD GONE SERIOUSLY WRONG. MORE GAUZE, PLEASE. MORE GAUZE. SIR, THERE'S TOO MUCH SOFT TISSUE DAMAGE. THE DOCTOR SAID HOW MUCH DAMAGE I HAD TO MY LEG, AND THEY FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT AMPUTATED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS, SIR? SIR. I... SIR. YOU UNDERSTAND THIS? I WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNED. TOOK ME FOR A LOOP. ALL RIGHT. SO, GUYS, LET'S PREP HIM FOR SURGERY. Narrator: BARRY'S ESTRANGED WIFE, KATHY, RACES TO THE HOSPITAL. Kathy: I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM EMANUEL HOSPITAL, AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE SAID, "I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU, BUT YOUR HUSBAND IS BEING BROUGHT IN BY GROUND... [ Voice breaking ] OH, MY GOD. [ GASPS ] BARRY. OH, MY GOD. BARRY. I WENT OVER TO HIM. OH, MY GOD. AND HE ACTED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE, BUT WE ALL KNEW DIFFERENTLY. I ABSOLUTELY WAS SO NUMB. [ SOBS ] I COULDN'T BREATHE. Anchorman: AT 10:19 A.M., FOLKS WHO LIVE IN LAURELHURST HEARD THE BOOM. Narrator: THREE HOURS AFTER THE BOMB BLAST, THE HORNSTEINS' DRIVEWAY IS NOW A MAJOR CRIME SCENE. Officer: IT DOES APPEAR TO BE FAIRLY POWERFUL. WE DO HAVE BLAST MATERIAL SPREAD OUT OVER HUNDREDS OF FEET. THIS SEEMED LIKE IT WAS DIRECTED AT SOMEONE AND THAT THEY INTENDED SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT. [ BELL RINGS ] Narrator: WITH BARRY IN SURGERY, DETECTIVE LAW QUESTIONS HIS TEENAGE SON, JACK, AT SCHOOL. HE THINKS HE MAY HAVE VITAL INFORMATION. Law: HE WOULD'VE BEEN THE LAST PERSON THAT WOULD'VE SEEN, HIS FATHER PRIOR TO THE DETONATION OF THE DEVICE. WHEN YOU LEFT FOR SCHOOL THIS MORNING, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING AT ALL IN THE DRIVEWAY? NO, NOTHING. Jack: I WAS COMPLETELY CLUELESS AND WANTED [CHUCKLES] WANTED TO KNOW WHY SOMEBODY WOULD PUT A BOMB AT MY PARENT'S HOUSE. SO IT WAS, YOU KNOW, I WASN'T REALLY MUCH HELP. AND YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT? YES, I'M SURE. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, DETECTIVE LAW RETURNS TO THE HOSPITAL. MR. HORNSTEIN, IS THERE ANYONE THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT WOULD WANT TO HURT YOU? NO. NO. NO, NO. I DON'T FEEL I HAD ANY REAL ENEMIES WHO WOULD TRY TO KILL ME. Narrator: BARRY IS AN INSURANCE AGENT WORKING WITH THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY, SOMETIMES HANDLING SUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS. AND THERE IS NOBODY AT WORK THAT HAS AN ISSUE WITH YOU OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? NO. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS, MR. HORNSTEIN? I'M SURE. EVERYTHING, AS FAR AS MY BUSINESS LIFE, WAS STRAIGHT UP-AND-UP. THERE WOULD BE NO REASON TO HAVE VENGEANCE ON ME. Woman: DR. JEFFERIES, PLEASE DIAL 212. DR. JEFFERIES, DIAL 212. I HAD TO ELIMINATE PEOPLE FROM BEING A SUSPECT WITH THIS CRIME. MRS. HORNSTEIN, MAY WE SPEAK SOMEWHERE, PLEASE? MONEY DOES MAKE PEOPLE CRAZY. RIGHT THIS WAY. YOU KNOW, YOU HEAR ABOUT SPOUSES TRYIN' TO BUMP OFF THE OTHER ONE. FIRST QUESTION THAT CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH WAS... DOES YOUR HUSBAND HAVE ANY LIFE INSURANCE? WHAT? I IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED THEN THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I FELT THAT I HAD TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF AND FIGHT BACK. IT'S BARRY. HE HAS A GAMBLING PROBLEM. Narrator: AFTER KICKING A BOMB IN HIS OWN DRIVEWAY, INSURANCE AGENT BARRY HORNSTEIN... BARRY. ...UNDERGOES LIFE-SAVING SURGERY. HIS RIGHT LEG IS AMPUTATED BELOW THE KNEE. AT LEAST I WAS ALIVE. AND SO YOU TAKE A TRADE-OFF. IF I WOULD'VE PICKED UP THE BOMB, I WOULDN'T BE HERE. Narrator: WHEN BARRY'S ESTRANGED WIFE, KATHY, REALIZES THE POLICE ARE LOOKING AT HER AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT, SHE DELIVERS A SHOCKING REVELATION. IT'S BARRY. HE HAS A GAMBLING PROBLEM. IT'S BARRY'S GAMBLING ADDICTION THAT EXPLAINS THE COUPLE'S RECENT SEPARATION. DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO US, BARRY? I... I DIDN'T KNOW THE TRUE SERIOUSNESS OF IT, BUT I KNEW IT WAS SERIOUS. YOU HAVE TO STOP. I CAN STOP. AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT PROOF THAT HE IS DOING IT AND HE'S STILL LYING TO YOUR FACE, IT'S A PROBLEM. YOU'RE STILL GAMBLING. - YOU'RE LYING TO ME. - I'M NOT. I'M GETTING HELP. I'M... YOU'RE LYING TO YOURSELF. WE HAD BEEN IN THERAPY FOR ABOUT A YEAR, AND HE WAS STILL IN DENIAL ABOUT IT ALL. IT'S GONNA STOP. NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU AGAIN, BARRY. YOU GET HELP... SERIOUSLY... OR I'M LEAVING. Narrator: NOW, KATHY WONDERS IF BARRY'S GAMBLING MIGHT BE BEHIND THE BOMB. ARE YOU STILL GAMBLING? Barry: I WAS EMBARRASSED 'CAUSE THIS WAS AN EMBARRASSING POINT OF MY LIFE. I WAS SNEAKIN' AROUND, GAMBLING. AND I BECAME OBSESSED WITH IT AND TO A POINT WHERE IT TOOK A LOT OUT OF OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT. Narrator: BARRY ADMITS TO LOSING OVER $200,000 ON VIDEO POKER, BLEEDING THE FAMILY SAVINGS DRY. DETECTIVE LAW THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS SORT OF VENDETTA FOR A GAMBLING DEBT. DO YOU OWE ANYONE MONEY FROM THE GAMBLING? YOU NEVER WENT TO ANY LOAN SHARKS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? NO. I NEVER BORROWED MONEY FROM OTHER PEOPLE. I THOUGHT OF IT, BUT I NEVER DID. I'D HURT NO ONE BUT MYSELF AND MY FAMILY. Law: I TOOK, BASICALLY, BARRY AT HIS WORD. THERE REALLY WASN'T ANY AVENUES, ANY INVESTIGATIVE LEADS REGARDING THE GAMBLING TO FOLLOW. Narrator: POLICE HOPE THAT FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF THE CRIME SCENE WILL PROVIDE FRESH LEADS. IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THE BOMB CONSISTING OF SIX INCHES OF STEEL PIPE PACKED WITH POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES IS NO ORDINARY IMPROVISED DEVICE. THE DEVICE WAS MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN A TYPICAL PIPE BOMB. IT HAD ELECTRONIC BATTERY TO ASSIST IN DETONATION. Narrator: SMALL MAGNETS WERE DESIGNED TO ATTACH THE BOMB TO A CAR. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WHOEVER BUILT IT INTENDED TO KILL HIS OR HER VICTIM. IT HAD BALL BEARINGS INSIDE THE PIPE THAT WOULD CREATE MORE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY. THIS WAS NOT JUST A SIMPLE PIPE BOMB. BUT SO FAR, POLICE FIND NO EVIDENCE OR CLUES TO HELP IDENTIFY THE BOMBER. WE DIDN'T GET ANY FORENSIC EVIDENCE OFF OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. THERE WAS NO FINGERPRINTS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE. Narrator: THREE DAYS AFTER THE BOMBING, THE INVESTIGATION HAS STALLED. THE DIFFICULTY I WAS HAVING IN THIS INVESTIGATION IS, "WHO WOULD WANT TO GO TO THESE METHOD AND MEANS TO KILL BARRY HORNSTEIN?" Narrator: BILL LAW DECIDES TO QUESTION KATHY HORNSTEIN FURTHER AT HOME. SHE'S BEEN LIVING HERE SINCE SHE LEFT BARRY TWO MONTHS AGO. LAW WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE HORNSTEIN FAMILY. HOW'S JACK BEEN LATELY? HOW DO YOU MEAN? WELL, LIKE, IS HE... IS HE HAPPY? HAS THERE BEEN ANY CHANGE IN HIS BEHAVIOR? I SAID, "I'M LOSING JACK." HE WAS BARELY SPEAKING, AND THAT WAS QUITE DISTURBING. Narrator: JACK IS SPENDING MORE AND MORE TIME ALONE IN HIS ROOM. HIS ONE CONFIDANTE IS HIS LONG-DISTANCE GIRLFRIEND, CINDY. THE 15-YEAR-OLD LIVES A THREE-HOUR DRIVE AWAY IN KENNEWICK, WASHINGTON STATE. JACK ONLY GETS TO SEE HER EVERY OTHER MONTH. I WOULD SAY HIS RELATIONSHIP WAS TYPICAL. YOU KNOW, THEY... BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE EACH OTHER THAT MUCH, THEY E-MAILED AND TALKED ON THE PHONE EVERY NIGHT. HOW IS IT WITH BARRY? Law: I WAS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE MOTIVE BEHIND THIS WAS. YEAH, I KNEW MY PARENTS WERE SEPARATED MOSTLY DUE TO 'CAUSE MY DAD HAD SOME GAMBLING ISSUES. YOU... YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO SEPARATE, BUT I'M GONNA SUPPORT MY MOM. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT HER TO GET DRAGGED DOWN, YOU KNOW... BY MY DAD'S ISSUE OF, YOU KNOW, PISSIN' AWAY MONEY. DO YOU THINK JACK BLAMES BARRY FOR THE SEPARATION? YOU THINK JACK DID THIS? THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHY HE DID IT. NO. NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO WAY ON GOD'S EARTH. THERE ISN'T A MEAN BONE IN HIS BODY. HE'S JUST NOT LIKE THAT, ABSOLUTELY NOT LIKE THAT. Narrator: DESPITE KATHY'S DEFENSE OF HER SON, LAW SUSPECTS JACK KNOWS MORE THAN HE'S LETTING ON. THE NEXT DAY, WHEN LAW INTERVIEWS JACK, THE TEENAGER ADMITS SOMETHING DISTURBING. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THINGS ABOUT ME. LIKE WHAT? LIKE, BAD THINGS, LIKE, REALLY BAD THINGS ABOUT ME. TURNS OUT SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE BOMB BLAST, SOMEONE STARTED SENDING E-MAILS TO STUDENTS AT JACK'S HIGH SCHOOL, ENCOURAGING THEM TO PRINT OFF FLYERS AND POST THEM AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WHAT IS THIS CRAP? Jack: THE FLYERS ARE BASICALLY DEFAMING MY CHARACTER AND WHATNOT, JUST BASICALLY MAKIN' UP A BUNCH OF RANDOM, CRAZY STUFF. Narrator: THE ANONYMOUS E-MAILS KEEP COMING, AMOUNTING TO AN ONLINE SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST JACK. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THIS TO YOU? I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY IDEA WHO IT WAS. MAYBE SOMEBODY I PISSED OFF IN HIGH SCHOOL. I... I DON'T KNOW. Narrator: AS POLICE INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN IS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE BOMB ATTACK ON JACK'S DAD, THERE'S A NEW DEVELOPMENT. SIX DAYS AFTER THE BLAST, JACK HORNSTEIN GETS AN ANONYMOUS LETTER IN THE MAIL. IT'S FROM SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE THE BOMBER. IT WAS A TOTAL SHOCK TO FIND OUT I WAS THE TARGET OF THE BOMB. Narrator: A BOMB BLAST LEAVES PORTLAND INSURANCE AGENT BARRY HORNSTEIN WITH HORRIFIC INJURIES. SIX DAYS LATER, IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIS TEENAGE SON, JACK, SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE THE BOMBER SAYS THEY GOT THE WRONG PERSON. I WAS THE TARGET OF THE BOMB. Narrator: AS SOON AS HE RECEIVES THE LETTER, JACK CALLS THE POLICE. UH, HELLO. THIS IS JACK HORNSTEIN CALLING FOR, UH, DE... UH, DETECTIVE LAW. THE LETTER'S IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR FORENSIC ANALYSIS TO CHECK FOR FINGERPRINTS AND DNA. THE RESULTS ARE FRUSTRATING. WE WERE UNABLE TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING OF EVIDENTIARY VALUE. Narrator: UP UNTIL NOW, 17-YEAR-OLD JACK HAS BEEN A POTENTIAL SUSPECT. BUT IF THE LETTER REALLY WAS SENT BY THE BOMBER, IT LOOKS LIKE JACK WAS INSTEAD THE INTENDED VICTIM. THE BOMB WAS FOUND BY JACK'S DAD IN THE SPOT WHERE JACK'S CAR WAS PREVIOUSLY PARKED. AND SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE BOMBING... WHAT IS THIS CRAP? ...SOMEONE HAD LAUNCHED AN ONLINE ATTACK ON JACK'S CHARACTER. Jack: AND SO YOU'RE STILL PRETTY NERVOUS. IT'S HARD TO THINK THAT THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT A SUSPECT. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: FEARING HIS LIFE IS STILL IN DANGER, JACK HEADS TO HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE IN KENNEWICK, WASHINGTON. AT 15, CINDY IS TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN JACK. JACK'S MOM HAS MET HER TWICE BEFORE IN PORTLAND. HEY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? Kathy: I THOUGHT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG FOR HIM, BUT HE TOLD ME TO MIND MY OWN BUSINESS, BASICALLY, AND THAT HE WAS GONNA SEE HER, AND HE REALLY LIKED HER. Narrator: CINDY'S SINGLE MOM, NANCY, WORKS THREE JOBS TO PROVIDE FOR HER DAUGHTER AND HER SON, CLINT. I THINK THAT CINDY, BECAUSE HER PARENTS WERE DIVORCED AND HER MOTHER WORKING ALL THOSE OTHER JOBS, SHE REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE SOMEBODY THERE. SHE MISSED THAT PART OF FAMILY LIFE. AND SO TO HAVE A NICE BOY AROUND, I MEAN, SHE JUST... SHE REALLY DID LOVE HIM, REALLY CHERISHED HIM. I... I REALLY THINK SO. Narrator: JACK AND CINDY'S PEACE IS ABOUT TO BE SHATTERED. CINDY'S BROTHER MAKES AN ALARMING DISCOVERY. JACK! JACK! QUICK! COME OUT HERE! LOOK AT THIS! ONE SECOND. Kathy: WELL, I THOUGHT JACK WOULD BE SAFE BECAUSE HE WAS COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM FRIENDS, FAMILY, FROM SCHOOL, FROM EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE THAT HE KNEW. Narrator: LYING IN THE GRASS IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A 6-INCH PIPE BOMB. CINDY! CALL 911. ATTACHED TO THE SUSPICIOUS DEVICE IS A NOTE IN BROKEN SPANISH. NOTE WAS DIRECTED TO ME. I'M ASSUMING THAT SOMEBODY FOLLOWED ME THERE. Narrator: POLICE RESPOND IMMEDIATELY. THE EXPLOSIVE DISPOSAL UNIT CHECKED THE DEVICE AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS A HOAX. IT WASN'T AN ACTUAL DEVICE. Kathy: I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE FAKE BOMB ON THE NEWS. I CALLED JACK IMMEDIATELY, AND I TOLD HIM THAT HE NEEDED TO GET HOME, PERIOD. WHOEVER WAS... WAS TRYING TO KILL ME, YOU KNOW, THE THOUGHT WAS THEY WERE GETTIN' MORE AND MORE DESPERATE. I WAS TERRIFIED. MAYBE A PIPE BOMB WOULD BE ATTACHED TO MY CAR. WHO KNOWS? WHO'S NEXT? BUT I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT JACK. I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM. MAYBE HE WAS GONNA DIE. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ SIGHS ] Narrator: TWO DAYS LATER, THE STAKES ARE RAISED EVEN HIGHER. CINDY'S MOM RECEIVES A LETTER IN THE MAIL. IT WARNS HER TO KEEP CINDY AWAY FROM JACK HORNSTEIN OR SHE WILL GET HURT. Law: THEY WERE TERRORIZED, AND AS INVESTIGATORS, WE FELT TERRIBLE FOR 'EM. WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THIS TO A CONCLUSION. Narrator: DESPITE GROWING EVIDENCE THAT JACK HORNSTEIN WAS THE TARGET OF THE ORIGINAL BOMB, BILL LAW STILL HAS NAGGING SUSPICIONS ABOUT JACK'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE ATTACK. THE ONLY WAY TO DISPEL THEM IS TO HAVE JACK TAKE A POLYGRAPH TEST. SO JUST BREATHE NORMALLY AND RELAX AND SIT STILL. OKAY, JACK? I WANTED TO CLEAR HIM OF ANY POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT IN PLANTING THE DEVICE. OKAY, JACK? Jack: THEY SENT ME IN THIS ROOM. IT'S YOU AND TWO DETECTIVES. WERE YOU DELIBERATELY FALSIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXPLOSION THAT INJURED YOUR DAD? I MEAN, THAT... THAT'S A POSSIBILITY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT. NO, SIR. THERE'S A LOT OF URGENCY FOR US TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MOTIVATION BEHIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS. Jack: WASN'T FUN. I THINK ALL DOORS ARE KIND OF KEPT OPEN AT THAT POINT TO SEE WHAT THE DEAL IS. HAVE YOU WRITTEN LETTERS AND E-MAILS TO DELIBERATELY CONCEAL YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE EXPLOSION? NO, SIR. Narrator: THE RESULT OF THE TEST IS SHOCKING. MY ATTORNEY SAID, "YOUR SON FLUNKED THE POLYGRAPH TEST, AND THEY THINK HE PUT THE BOMB THERE." Narrator: POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF PORTLAND, OREGON, INSURANCE AGENT BARRY HORNSTEIN. HIS TEENAGE SON, JACK, HAS JUST FAILED A POLYGRAPH TEST. AND NOW POLICE SUSPECT HE'S THE BOMBER. Kathy: I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED IT, BUT I WAS THAT CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD NOT LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT JACK THAT WOULD POINT HIM TOWARDS THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF HIS FATHER. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: DETECTIVES THINK JACK'S MOTIVE IS REVENGE. HE BLAMES HIS DAD'S GAMBLING FOR COSTING HIS FAMILY THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND HIS PARENTS THEIR MARRIAGE. JACK BEING A SUSPECT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST HORRIBLE THING FOR A MOTHER TO EVER HEAR. Narrator: WHEN HE'S BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING, JACK WAIVES HIS LEGAL RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY. OKAY, JACK. I GOT A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS FOR YA. YOU EVER SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO BUILD EXPLOSIVE DEVICES? YEAH, WITH FRIENDS. I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD THAT. WELL, TELL ME MORE. Narrator: JACK SAYS THIS IS JUST COINCIDENCE. AT THE TIME, I WAS STILL INTO, LIKE, MILITARY-TYPE STUFF, TOO, AND PLANES AND TANKS AND BOMBS, AND ALL THAT STUFF WAS ALL FASCINATING TO ME. SO. IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF GUYS HAVING FUN. YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT? THEY STARTED TO HAMMER QUESTIONS AT ME. DID YOU SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS THE MORNING OF THE BLAST? DO YOU BLAME YOUR FATHER FOR YOUR PARENTS GETTING SEPARATED? IT WAS PRETTY UNRELENTLESS FOR SIX OR SEVEN HOURS. SO, AGAIN, YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS THE MORNING OF THE BLAST? NO, SIR. NOTHING AT ALL AROUND YOUR DAD'S CAR? ARE YOU MAD AT HIM? DO YOU BLAME HIM FOR YOUR PARENTS BEING SEPARATED? NO. I LOVE HIM. Narrator: JACK SWEARS HE PLAYED NO PART IN THE BOMBING, NOR IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THREATENING LETTERS AND E-MAILS SUGGESTING HE'S THE REAL TARGET. A FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF JACK'S COMPUTER BACKS UP HIS CLAIMS. WE WERE ABLE TO TELL PRETTY QUICKLY THAT HIS COMPUTER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THIS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE SENT ANY OF THESE LETTERS. Narrator: JACK PASSES A SECOND POLYGRAPH TEST. POLICE DECIDE HIS FAILURE THE FIRST TIME AROUND MUST HAVE BEEN DUE TO EXTREME NERVES. THEY RULE HIM OUT AS THE BOMBER. Jack: DEFINITELY RELIEVED. YOU KNOW, MY THOUGHT WAS, "YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH BUNCH OF **** AND I TOLD YOU THIS, AND, YOU KNOW, TOLD YOU I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT." Narrator: STILL, AS FAR AS HIS FAMILY KNOWS, JACK'S LIFE REMAINS UNDER THREAT, AND THEY HAVE NO CLUE AS TO WHO HIS ENEMY IS. Kathy: BARRY AND I DECIDED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO MOVE HIM OUT OF PORTLAND UNTIL THIS THING WAS RESOLVED. Narrator: JACK TELLS HIS GIRLFRIEND, CINDY, THAT HIS PARENTS ARE GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT OF SCHOOL AND SEND HIM TO STAY WITH HIS UNCLE IN SEATTLE. TWO DAYS LATER, JACK RECEIVES AN E-MAIL FROM AN UNKNOWN ADDRESS. THE SENDER TELLS JACK THAT HE KNOWS WHERE HE'S GOING. MOM. MOM! HEY, YOU OKAY? LOOK AT THIS. AND NOWHERE IS SAFE. IT WAS TERRIBLE. IT WAS WORSE THAN TERRIBLE... IT WAS HORRENDOUS. HOW DO THEY KNOW YOU'RE GOING AWAY? NOW, NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THAT... NO ONE... EXCEPT CINDY. HE WAS JUST APART. HE WAS SO UPSET. THE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] [ SOBS ] [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: JACK'S MOTHER CALLS THE POLICE. THEY DISCOVER THAT THE THREATENING E-MAIL COMES FROM ONE OF THE AOL ADDRESSES USED IN THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST JACK TWO MONTHS EARLIER. WHOEVER IS USING THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS APPEARS TO KNOW JACK'S GIRLFRIEND, CINDY. WE BEGAN TO WONDER WHO SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR TO JACK. TO IDENTIFY WHO SENT THE E-MAIL, DETECTIVE LAW ASKS THE FORENSIC UNIT TO INVESTIGATE. CREDIT-CARD RECORDS REVEAL THE AOL ACCOUNT, SHAN1HERE, IS REGISTERED TO AN ADDRESS IN PORT ORCHARD, WASHINGTON, A SMALL TOWN NEAR SEATTLE. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] Law: WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO GO AND CONTACT THAT INDIVIDUAL IMMEDIATELY. Narrator: THREE WEEKS AFTER THE BOMBING, THE POLICE GET THEIR BREAKTHROUGH... A NAME. MR. GOFF? SURE. COME ON IN. TIMOTHY GOFF ISN'T KNOWN TO POLICE AND HAS NO PRIOR CONVICTIONS. DO YOU HAVE ANY I.D. ON YOU? SURE. 41-YEAR-OLD GOFF REVEALS HE HAS A 22-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, AND HE AND HIS WIFE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DIVORCING. SO WE'RE HERE INVESTIGATING A BOMBING IN PORTLAND. VICTIM'S NAME WAS A BARRY HORNSTEIN. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY BY THAT NAME? NO. UM, MAYBE ON THE NEWS. THE UNUSUAL THING IN MY MIND IS THAT HE NEVER ASKED, "WELL, WHY ARE YOU HERE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT?" Narrator: LAW WANTS TO KNOW IF GOFF HAS EVER USED THE SCREEN NAME SHAN1HERE. I HAVE A COUPLE NAMES, BUT NOT THAT ONE, NO. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY IT'S REGISTERED TO YOU? HE SAID IF THAT SCREEN NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIS COMPUTER, THAT SOMEONE MUST HAVE HACKED INTO HIS ACCOUNT. DO YOU KNOW A CINDY WILLIAMS? I MIGHT'VE TALKED TO HER ONCE OR TWICE IN A CHAT ROOM, BUT NO, NO. DO YOU MIND IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER? HEY, I'M PRETTY SURE YOU NEED A WARRANT FOR THAT. OKAY. THAT'S FINE. Narrator: WITHIN AN HOUR, LAW HAS A WARRANT TO SEARCH GOFF'S HOME. I LOOKED INTO HIS WALLET THAT WAS ON THE COUNTER, AND I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS INFORMATION REGARDING THE HORNSTEINS. EXCUSE ME, SIR. WHERE'D YOU GET THIS ADDRESS? Narrator: SUDDENLY, GOFF CHANGES HIS STORY. HE SAID THAT HE HAD GOT THAT INFORMATION FROM CINDY, AND HE ADMITTED THAT HE HADN'T BEEN COMPLETELY TRUTHFUL WITH ME ABOUT HER. HE SAID THAT HE KNEW HER BETTER THAN WHAT HE SAID. MR. GOFF? MR. GOFF. WHAT IS ON THESE? Narrator: LAW INSISTS ON LOOKING AT THE TAPES IMMEDIATELY. WHAT HE SEES STUNS HIM. IT DEPICTED HIM HAVING SEX WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL. IS THAT CINDY? Narrator: WHEN A PIPE BOMB EXPLODES, MAIMING INSURANCE AGENT BARRY HORNSTEIN, PORTLAND, OREGON P.D.s HUNT FOR THE BOMBER TAKES THEM ACROSS STATE LINES TO WASHINGTON. THREE WEEKS AFTER THE BLAST, THEIR PRIME SUSPECT IS 41-YEAR-OLD TIMOTHY GOFF. DETECTIVE BILL LAW IS IN THE MIDST OF SCREENING A VIDEOTAPE FOUND UNDER GOFF'S BED. IT DEPICTED HIM HAVING SEX WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL. Narrator: THE GIRL IS CINDY, THE GIRLFRIEND OF BOMBING VICTIM BARRY HORNSTEIN'S SON. AND AT THE TIME THE VIDEO WAS SHOT, CINDY WAS ONLY 14. Law: SHE TOLD HIM SHE WAS 16, AND HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS 31. Narrator: BEFORE MEETING IN PERSON, THE PAIR CHATTED FOR WEEKS ONLINE. GOFF SAYS CINDY WAS DESPERATE FOR COMPANY. Law: HE KEPT EXPRESSING INTEREST IN SEEING HER. SO, AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS, SHE AGREED TO HAVE GOFF MEET HER AT HER HOUSE. HE GAVE HER SOME JEWELRY, AND THEY TALKED ON THE PHONE FREQUENTLY, SOMETIMES ALMOST DAILY. Narrator: GOFF TOOK CINDY TO LOCAL MOTELS, WHERE THEY HAD SEX, SOMETIMES INVOLVING BONDAGE, WHICH GOFF VIDEOTAPED. BUT AFTER FOUR MONTHS, CINDY STOPPED SEEING HIM. HE SAID THAT HE WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD BROKEN UP WITH HIM, THAT NOW, SHE COULD FIND SOMEONE HER OWN AGE. I THEN TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THE BOMBING, AND HE... HE DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT. HE SAID THAT HE WAS TOLD ABOUT THE BOMBING THE DAY IT HAPPENED BY CINDY. Narrator: IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR POLICE TO FIND MATERIALS THEY SUSPECT WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE PIPE BOMB... ...WHICH NEARLY KILLED BARRY HORNSTEIN. HE TOLD US THAT HE WAS A PIPE FITTER, THAT HE INSTALLED COMMERCIAL SPRINKLER SYSTEMS. Narrator: BILL LAW SEIZES GOFF'S COMPUTER, BELIEVING HIS ONLINE LIFE IS NOW KEY TO THE CASE. I THINK THAT HE KNEW THAT THE REAL DAMAGING EVIDENCE WAS ON THE COMPUTER. Narrator: A FORENSIC SEARCH OF GOFF'S HARD DRIVE SHOWS HE'D USED THE INTERNET TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE A PIPE BOMB. THE COMPUTER WAS FULL OF DELETED INFORMATION OF HIS INTERNET ACTIVITY, THAT HE'D SEARCHED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE WORDS, TOGETHER, "MURDER" AND "BOMB." THERE WAS MULTIPLE SITES, YOU KNOW, HOW TO BUILD BOMBS AND HOW TO KILL WITH BOMBS SPECIFICALLY. Narrator: GOFF HAD CLEARLY INTENDED THE BOMB TO BLOW UP JACK HORNSTEIN'S CAR. Nelson: HE SPECIFICALLY SEARCHED FOR THE WIRING DIAGRAMS ON HONDA CIVICS SO THAT HE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WIRE THAT BOMB INTO THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OF THE CAR. Narrator: THE SEARCH ALSO UNCOVERS THE E-MAILS GOFF SENT TO JACK'S FELLOW STUDENTS AS PART OF HIS HATE CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM, WHICH STARTED SOON AFTER GOFF FOUND OUT CINDY WAS DATING HIM. THE E-MAILS SUGGEST HE WAS BEHAVING LIKE A JILTED LOVER, TRYING TO END CINDY AND JACK'S RELATIONSHIP BY DEFAMING HER BOYFRIEND'S CHARACTER. WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK, HE PLANTED A BOMB. HE WAS WILLING TO KILL ANYBODY THAT WOULD WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER THAT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING WITH HER. Narrator: AFTER CINDY SPLIT WITH GOFF, THEY STAYED IN TOUCH. AND DURING THEIR PHONE CALLS AND E-MAIL EXCHANGES, CINDY UNWITTINGLY FED GOFF INFORMATION ABOUT THE HORNSTEINS THAT HE THEN USED TO TERRORIZE THE FAMILY. IN SEPTEMBER OF 2004, GOFF PLEADS GUILTY TO ATTEMPTED MURDER. HE IS SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS. IT WAS THE EVIDENCE ON THE COMPUTER THAT CONVICTED TIMOTHY GOFF. BEFORE STARTING THAT SENTENCE, GOFF ALSO SPENDS 26 MONTHS IN BENTON COUNTY JAIL IN KENNEWICK, WASHINGTON, FOR SEX CRIMES AGAINST A MINOR. GOFF SERVED HIS TIME AND IS NOW A FREE MAN. Kathy: YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE... HOW TO START OVER AGAIN. I JUST WANTED OUR FAMILY TO BE RESTORED TO AS NORMAL AS WE COULD GET. Narrator: JACK HORNSTEIN AND HIS YOUNGER SISTER, BETSY, ARE NOW OFFICERS WITH THE PORTLAND POLICE BUREAU, AND BARRY AND KATHY HORNSTEIN ARE BACK TOGETHER. Barry: MY FAMILY'S INTACT. MY SON WASN'T KILLED. IT COULD'VE BEEN HIM. I'VE ONLY LOST A LEG. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP PRICE TO PAY... A LEG TO GET BACK YOUR LIFE AGAIN WITH YOUR WIFE.
