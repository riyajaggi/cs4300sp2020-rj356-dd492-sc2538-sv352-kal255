 WITH A HANDSOME SALARY. OPEN IT UP. MY GOODNESS. CAN WE AFFORD THIS? YEAH, CLOSED SOME BIG DEALS AT WORK. LESLIE AND I STARTED DATING IN COLLEGE IN MID-1989 AND GOT MARRIED IN OCTOBER OF '90. I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER AND SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME. - HOW'S IT LOOK? - IT LOOKS GREAT. BRIAN AND LESLIE WORK HARD TO BUILD A COMFORTABLE LIFE AND RAISE THEIR TWO YOUNG CHILDREN, COURTNEY AND TYLER, IN A LOVING HOME. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! WE WERE A HAPPY FAMILY LIVING IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO BRING UP CHILDREN. WOW, IS THAT REAL DIAMONDS? IT IS. ISN'T IT PRETTY? THEY WERE A HAPPY COUPLE. THEY WOULD HUG AND KISS GOOD-BYE. EVERYTHING SEEMED LIKE IT WAS NORMAL. MY PARENTS AND MY SISTER AND I GENERALLY HAD A -- A PRETTY NORMAL LIFE. IT WAS MOSTLY A HAPPY FAMILY. ALL RIGHT, WELL I GOT GET FLYING HERE. JEFF WANTS ME DOWN AT THE OFFICE EARLY. - SO... - REALLY? - YEAH, HAVE A GREAT DAY. - ON A SUNDAY? LESLIE MISSES SPENDING TIME WITH BRIAN. HE WORKS LONG HOURS, AND THESE DAYS, SEES LESS AND LESS OF HIS FAMILY. I'M IN INDUSTRIAL SALES. AND I -- I COULD BE ON THE ROAD FOR 10 OR 12 HOURS. ALTHOUGH LESLIE DOESN'T NEED TO WORK, SHE FEELS AIMLESS WITH ONLY KIDS AND DOMESTIC CHORES TO FILL HER DAY. YEAH, I'LL BE HOME SOON. I NEVER REALLY SAW MY DAD MUCH WHEN I WAS LITTLE. - BYE, EVERYONE! - HE JUST SEEMED LIKE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING FOR WORK. I MISS DADDY. ALL RIGHT. "SESAME," "MICKEY," "ARTHUR," "THOMAS"? MICKEY. YEAH... BRIAN NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE TIME TO TALK TO LESLIE, LET ALONE EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING AT WORK. DON'T KNOW, HE NEVER TELLS ME. I THINK HE'S FORGOTTEN... FEELING SIDELINED BY BRIAN, LESLIE DECIDES SHE WANTS TO START HER OWN BUSINESS FROM HOME SELLING CHILDREN'S BOOKS. SHE HAD A BACHELOR'S IN BUSINESS, AND THEN SHE WENT ON TO GET HER MBA. SHE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE NEXT THING THAT WAS GONNA MAKE HER RICH. LESLIE TURNS TO THE ONLINE WORLD SEEKING INVESTORS AND LIKE-MINDED ENTREPRENEURS. SHE QUICKLY STARTS MAKING FRIENDS AND MEETING POTENTIAL BUSINESS PARTNERS. MY MOM ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE SHE HAD SOMETHING GOING ON. SHE HAD HOME-BASED BUSINESSES THAT SHE WOULD START. IN 2003, GOING ONLINE IS A NEW AND EXCITING WAY OF MEETING PEOPLE. SHE SPENT A LOT OF HER FREE TIME ON HER COMPUTER. SHE ALMOST SEEMED TO BE ENGROSSED BY IT. ONE ONLINE VOICE IN PARTICULAR, JJ01, IS EAGER TO HELP OUT. JJ THINKS LESLIE HAS GREAT BUSINESS IDEAS AND UNDERSTANDS HER AMBITIONS. I THINK THAT SHE WAS FRUSTRATED WITH HER LIFE, AND I THINK THAT CENTERED AROUND HER BEING HOME WITH THE KIDS ALL DAY. BUT I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING AND I JUST PUT MY HEAD DOWN AND PLOWED THROUGH FOR MY FAMILY. WHY ARE YOU GUYS IN YOUR PAJAMAS? GO GET CHANGED. LESLIE'S ONLINE DISTRACTIONS BEGIN TO AFFECT HER HOME LIFE. - HI. - HI! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DID NOTICE A CHANGE. I WOULD COME HOME FROM WORK AND THE KIDS' TOYS WOULD ALL BE OUT. THERE WOULD BE DISHES IN THE SINK AND I BEGAN TO WONDER, "WHAT IS SHE DOING ALL DAY THAT THE HOUSE LOOKS LIKE THIS WHEN I COME HOME?" KIND OF A MESS IN HERE. WHAT'S FOR DINNER? WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO COOK ANYTHING, YET. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL JUST MICROWAVE SOMETHING. I DID ASK HER, YOU KNOW, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THE COMPUTER ALL THE TIME?" AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S EITHER THIS BUSINESS OR THAT BUSINESS. SHE WAS ON THE INTERNET ALL DAY LONG, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE NOTHING GOT DONE AT THE HOUSE. OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, LESLIE IS COMPLETELY SEDUCED BY HER ONLINE WORLD. AS SOON AS SHE WAVES GOOD-BYE TO BRIAN AND DROPS TYLER OFF AT SCHOOL, SHE'S RIGHT BACK ONLINE WITH JJ. "ARTHUR," "DORA," "CLIFFORD"? HERE, YOU DO IT, NO GROWN-UP STUFF, OKAY? LESLIE'S ONLINE CHATS GET MORE PERSONAL. JJ GIVES LESLIE THE KIND OF ADULT ATTENTION SHE'S BEEN CRAVING. FAMILY LIFE BEGINS TO TAKE A BACK SEAT TO HER ONLINE RELATIONSHIP. I ALMOST FELT LIKE THERE WERE THINGS GOING ON IN HER LIFE THAT SHE WASN'T TELLING US. ONE DAY, WHILE BRIAN IS AWAY ON BUSINESS, LESLIE TAKES COURTNEY AND TYLER OUT ON A MYSTERY ERRAND. - WHERE ARE WE GOING? - I DON'T KNOW. THE CHILDREN ARE WORRIED. I SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER HER NOT REALLY TELLING ME WHERE THEY WERE GONNA GO. WE'RE JUST GOING TO SEE ONE OF MOMMY'S FRIENDS. WHO? I DON'T KNOW. SHE TOLD US THAT IT WAS AN OLD FRIEND FROM, I -- I THINK, COLLEGE, BUT SHE WAS BEING VERY VAGUE. EVENTUALLY, THEY STOP AT A DINER. HEY! I'M MEETING SOMEONE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT LESLIE HAS MET HER ONLINE PAL, JJ, IN THE FLESH. I REMEMBER BEING INTRODUCED TO HIM. - YOU'RE TYLER? - YEAH. I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ANYTHING OF IT AT THE TIME. COURTNEY, YOU LIKE JELLY BEANS, TOO? OKAY. YOU GUYS CAN CALL ME JJ. HE SEEMED REALLY NICE. BUT SOMETHING WAS ODD BECAUSE I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT IT WAS ONE OF MY MOM'S FRIENDS, BUT I HAD NEVER MET HIM BEFORE. THEY GAVE ME A BUNCH OF QUARTERS TO GO IN THE ARCADE AND PLAY. HAVE FUN! HAVE FUN. HEY. I'LL JUST SIT DOWN. SHE SEEMED TO BE VERY CLOSE TO THIS GUY FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS ONLY A FRIEND FROM COLLEGE. AND IT JUST SEEMED SUSPICIOUS. HE SEEMS NICE. I DON'T KNOW. AND TO LESLIE, JJ SEEMS EVER NICER IN PERSON THAN ON THE INTERNET. AND SHE CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT HE'S HANDSOME. I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT. JJ IS VERY INTERESTED IN HOW MUCH MONEY LESLIE'S HUSBAND EARNS, BUT LESLIE KNOWS VERY LITTLE. HE'S WORKING. HE'S AWAY ON BUSINESS. - DOES HE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY? - WE DO OKAY. DO YOU THINK MOMMY LIKES HIM? IT LOOKS LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE HIM. WHEN BRIAN RETURNS HOME FROM HIS BUSINESS TRIP, LESLIE'S SECRET ONLINE LIFE FINALLY CATCHES UP WITH HER. SORRY ABOUT ALL THE MICROWAVE DINNERS. I'VE BEEN SO BUSY TODAY RUNNING AROUND. SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO CLOSE OUT OF HER E-MAIL. AND SHE WAS E-MAILING BACK AND FORTH WITH A GUY, AND I SAW IT. WHAT IS THIS? KIDS, GO TO YOUR ROOM, PLEASE. NOW. THEY WERE DIRTY TALKING TO EACH OTHER, BASICALLY. I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA SUGARCOAT IT. IT WAS JUST SEX TALK. I CONFRONTED HER ABOUT IT. WHAT IS THIS? IS THIS WHAT YOU DO ALL DAY LONG? - MY GOD. I -- I JUST... I'M... I GOT CAUGHT UP IN IT. I JUST STARTED TALKING AND -- AND THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND. THIS BREAKS MY HEART. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT, AND IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. LESLIE, THIS HAS GOTTA STOP. IT WILL. IT ABSOLUTELY WILL. I KNOW. LESLIE ADMITS THAT SHE IS FEELING LONELY AND UNDERVALUED. BRIAN AGREES TO FORGIVE HIS WIFE, PROVIDED SHE DROPS THE ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. I WON'T RESPOND. I -- I WON'T RESPOND EVER. WELL, WE REALLY DIDN'T DISCUSS DIVORCE. I STILL LOVED HER AND I CONSIDERED HER TO BE A GOOD MOTHER TO MY CHILDREN. ALTHOUGH LESLIE STOPS RESPONDING TO JJ, JJ CONTINUES TO CONTACT HER. HIS MESSAGES POUR IN DAY AND NIGHT. BUT LESLIE HAS PROMISED TO PUT AN END TO THE RELATIONSHIP, EVEN IF IT MEANS PUTTING ASIDE HER BUSINESS AMBITIONS. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. IT HAS TO END. HEY, LESLIE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE GARAGE? I GOTTA GO. HAVE YOU SEEN MY KARATE STUFF? NO. A FEW WEEKS LATER, IT SEEMS THAT LESLIE AND BRIAN HAVE MANAGED TO GET THEIR MARRIAGE BACK ON TRACK. YOU KNOW, IT -- IT DID SEEM LIKE IT WAS SETTLING DOWN, YES. JEFF'S CALLING ME. I GOTTA GO. BUT LESLIE APPEARS NERVOUS AND WORRIED AS SOON AS BRIAN LEAVES FOR WORK. SHE SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS ALWAYS ON EDGE. WHEN HER PHONE WOULD RING, SHE WOULD JUMP AND GET IT IMMEDIATELY. JUST WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE LESLIE HAS FINALLY PUT THINGS RIGHT WITH HER MARRIAGE, THEIR DOMESTIC PEACE IS SHATTERED. I'M LEAVING FOR WORK. IT'S 5:30 OR 6 IN THE MORNING. AND I NOTICE THERE'S A NOTE UNDERNEATH MY WINDSHIELD WIPER. I GRAB THE NOTE AND I OPEN IT UP AND IT SAID, "I AM WATCHING HER. SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. YOU WILL SEE." AND IMMEDIATELY, I HAD CHILLS. AND I'M LOOKING AROUND, THINKING, "WHO PUT THIS NOTE HERE?" THE NOTE WAS A -- A THREAT TO HER. I COULDN'T, FOR THE LIFE OF ME, FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. NO, I ACTUALLY HAD GOOSEBUMPS. AND I'M LOOKING AROUND. I'M GETTING READY TO DEFEND MYSELF AT THIS POINT. BRIAN LONG HAS JUST FOUND A HANDWRITTEN NOTE ON HIS CAR THREATENING HARM TO HIS WIFE, LESLIE. IT COMES JUST WEEKS AFTER BRIAN DISCOVERED SHE WAS HAVING AN ONLINE AFFAIR. THAT SCARED ME. YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CAREFUL WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU FIND A NOTE LIKE THAT ON YOUR CAR. HONEY, I JUST FOUND THIS... I TAKE IT BACK IN. AND I TELL MY WIFE, "LOOK, THIS WAS ON MY CAR." "I'M WATCHING HER. SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. - YOU WILL SEE." - SHE WAS VERY SHOCKED. - BRIAN, WHAT IS THIS? - I HAVE NO IDEA. SHE WAS SCARED, BUT I HAD APPOINTMENTS THAT I HAD TO GO TO. I'VE GOTTA BE IN COLUMBUS AT 8. BRIAN, I'M ALONE WITH THE KIDS. WHAT IF THIS PERSON IS OUTSIDE? SHE WAS GONNA BE FINE. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE HOUSE IF SHE CALLED 911. I TELL HER TO MAKE SURE ALL THE DOORS ARE LOCKED. I LEAVE AND GO TO WORK. I GOTTA GO. I'M REALLY SORRY. OKAY? SEE YA. IS EVERYTHING OKAY, MOMMY? EVERYTHING'S FINE, SWEETIE. WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE NOTE, I WAS SCARED BECAUSE I WAS JUST LITTLE. AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. LESLIE RECEIVES ANOTHER ANXIOUS TEXT FROM HER FORMER ONLINE FLAME, JJ. WATCH SOME TV. THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE STALKING CONTINUES. LESLIE WAS AT A WAL-MART, AND SHE TOLD ME THAT SOMEBODY HAD LEFT A NOTE ON HER CAR MAKING THREATS AT LESLIE. BRIAN. BRIAN, I FOUND ANOTHER NOTE. SO WHAT DOES IT SAY? IT SAYS, "I'M WATCHING YOU." ARE YOU OKAY, MOMMY? I THINK THEY TRIED TO HIDE IT TO SOME EXTENT, BUT I WOULD JUST OVERHEAR BITS AND PIECES. I DEFINITELY THOUGHT WE WERE IN SOME KIND OF DANGER. I'M REALLY SCARED, BRIAN. I MEAN, THIS KEEPS HAPPENING. I THINK WE SHOULD CALL THE POLICE. THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING OVER A COUPLE OF NOTES. BRIAN. BRIAN, IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON? LESLIE IS CONCERNED THAT MAYBE BRIAN IS HOLDING SOMETHING BACK ABOUT HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS. IS SOMEONE TRYING TO BLACKMAIL YOU? I HAD NO ENEMIES THAT I KNEW OF. I HAD NO IDEA. AS THE DAYS GO ON, THERE ARE MORE THREATENING NOTES LEFT FOR THE LONGS ON BRIAN'S CAR, LESLIE'S CAR, IN THE MAILBOX AND ON THE PORCH. ALL OF THE NOTES WERE A THREAT TO LESLIE. SHE WAS SCARED. I DIDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS SAFE FOR HER TO BE AT THE HOUSE. I ALMOST DREADED WHEN SCHOOL WOULD BE OVER BECAUSE THEN I HAD TO GO HOME AND EVERYONE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE NOTES AND STALKERS. MOM? I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. SOMEBODY WAS MESSING WITH MY FAMILY, AND I JUST WANTED IT TO STOP. BRIAN IS DETERMINED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE THREATS. HE DECIDES IT'S TIME TO INVOLVE THE ST. CLAIRSVILLE POLICE. MRS. LONG. OFFICER. MOM SEEMS SCARED. YEAH. LOOK, FOURTEEN NOTES. LOOK. WHEN I ARRIVED THERE, THEY SHOWED ME THE NOTES THAT, THEY'VE RECEIVED. AND HERE'S THE LATEST. THEY'D RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE OR TWO NOTES A WEEK. "I AM WATCHING YOU." THE NOTES WERE, UM, HANDWRITTEN, PRINTED. IT WAS ALL ON LESLIE. SHE WAS THE ONE THAT WAS BEING STALKED. THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE FEELING OF TENSION. I WAS PRETTY SCARED. I FELT LIKE SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY WAS IN DANGER, AND I WASN'T SURE WHY. ANY, ENEMIES, DISPUTES WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS? WE WENT THROUGH THE "WHO WOULD HAVE IT OUT FOR YA, WHO WOULD --" AND THEY HAD NO IDEA. HOW ABOUT YOU, MRS. LONG? NO. LESLIE KEEPS QUIET ABOUT HER ONLINE RELATIONSHIP WITH JJ. MR. LONG, YOU HAVE ANY, BUSINESS DEALS THAT WENT SOUR? DISPUTES WITH CLIENTS? NO. DO YOU THINK DAD'S DONE SOMETHING BAD? FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, WHAT THE POLICE SAID, THAT MY DAD MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH SOME OTHER BAD PEOPLE. NO. HOW'S THIS ON ME NOW? I WAS WORRIED FOR EVERYBODY'S SAFETY. IF SOMEBODY HAD ENOUGH GUMPTION TO GET UP ON THE PORCH, I THOUGHT, WELL, MAYBE SOMEBODY HAS ENOUGH NERVE TO, YOU KNOW, GO IN THE HOUSE AND DO SOMETHING... TAKE A CHILD. DO YOU HAVE A GUN IN THE HOUSE? I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING GONNA HAPPEN. BUT WITH NO EVIDENCE, APART FROM THE NOTES THEMSELVES, THERE'S NOT MUCH FOR THE POLICE TO GO ON. SO THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO? SEE, WHAT DID I TELL YOU? BRIAN LONG WAS ANGRY THAT -- THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT COULDN'T SOLVE HIS PROBLEMS. WE -- WE'LL HAVE SOME UNMARKED UNITS PATROL THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE NOTES THAT COME UP OR ANYTHING ELSE SUSPICIOUS YOU SEE, YOU GIVE US A CALL. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I -- I JUST FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE THERE THAT, THEY WEREN'T TELLING ME. A FEW DAYS LATER, THE STALKING ESCALATES BEYOND THREATENING NOTES. AS LESLIE EXITS THE LOCAL LIBRARY, A MAN SHE'S NEVER MET BEFORE TRIES TO TALK TO HER. MY NAME IS ANTHONY CINCONE. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP ME. ONE DAY, LESLIE CALLED. HI, WHAT'S UP? SHE'S AT THE LIBRARY, AND A GUY COMES UP TO HER. I JUST RAN INTO THIS REALLY WEIRD GUY OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY. SHE FELT HARASSED. SHE WAS CREEPED OUT. I FEEL LIKE I THINK HE'S STILL WATCHING ME. - WELL, GET OUTTA THERE. - SHE SAID HIS NAME. HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF. HE SAID HIS NAME WAS ANTHONY CINCONE. - DO -- DO YOU KNOW HIM? - I -- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK HE MIGHT BE FOLLOWING ME. LESLIE, JUST GET OUTTA THERE. BRIAN... SHE WAS SCARED. LESLIE? LESLIE! LESLIE MANAGES TO ESCAPE THE MAN WHO CONFRONTED HER. AS SOON AS SHE GETS HOME, SHE CHECKS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WEBSITE AND FINDS ANTHONY CINCONE. HE'S GOT QUITE A RECORD. SUDDENLY, ANOTHER TEXT COMES IN FROM LESLIE'S FORMER ONLINE BOYFRIEND, JJ, WHO IS STILL IN DAILY CONTACT. HI, HONEY. WHERE ARE THE KIDS? I PUT THEM UPSTAIRS. I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO SEE THIS. WHAT IS IT? HE HAS A RECORD. I HEARD THE NAME TONY CINCONE, AND I HEARD THAT IT WAS THE GUY THAT WAS LEAVING THE NOTES. I WAS SCARED BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE'D DO. MY GOD, THIS GUY'S A PIECE OF WORK. I THINK HE WAS OUTSIDE THE STORE YESTERDAY, TOO. MY MOTHER BLAMED THE NOTES ON TONY CINCONE AND, SAID THAT HE WAS STALKING HER. THIS WAS AN ESCALATION FROM THE NOTES. WHERE'S MY BASEBALL BAT? THINGS WERE GETTING VERY SERIOUS, AND MY RAGE WAS BUILDING. GOD, IF I EVER CATCH THIS GUY... HE'S GONNA WISH HE WAS NEVER BORN. I WANTED TO CONFRONT HIM TO LET HIM KNOW THAT IF IT DIDN'T STOP, IT WASN'T GONNA BE GOOD FOR HIM. AND I GRAB A BALL BAT AND I GO OUTSIDE. DAD SEEMS REALLY UPSET. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA DO WITH THAT BASEBALL BAT? AS HE RETURNS TO THE HOUSE, BRIAN SEES SOMETHING ALARMING. I LOOKED DOWN AND THERE'S A CAT LAYING THERE AND, YOU CAN TELL IT'S DEAD. LESLIE! LESLIE. LOOK. MY GOD! LESLIE WAS SHOCKED. IN LIGHT OF THE NOTES, THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT A CAT JUST CAME UP ON MY PORCH AND DIED. I'M CALLING 911 RIGHT NOW. THIS IS ENOUGH. I WANTED TO FIND WHO THIS WAS. THE LONG FAMILY IS UNDER ATTACK. AFTER MOM, LESLIE, BREAKS OFF HER ONLINE AFFAIR, SHE RECEIVES THREATENING NOTES AND IS NOW BEING STALKED BY A STRANGER. THE SITUATION ESCALATES WHEN THE FAMILY FINDS A DEAD CAT THROWN ON THEIR PORCH. DESPERATE, THEY AGAIN TURN TO THE POLICE FOR HELP. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING WHOEVER WAS DOING THIS. OFFICER JEFF HENRY ARRIVES TO FIND BRIAN LONG BESIDE HIMSELF WITH ANGER. IF I'D HAVE CAUGHT SOMEBODY ON MY PROPERTY, PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR HIM. WHAT'S THE BASEBALL BAT FOR? IN CASE I SEE THIS GUY. I DON'T KNOW. I TOLD HIM THAT HE CAN'T TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS. FIRST OF ALL, LET'S TAKE IT EASY. YEAH, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL. THE INVESTIGATION'S ONGOING. THE DEAD CAT'S OVER HERE. THE CAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS RUN OVER. IT'S DISGUSTING. YEAH, THAT'S DEAD ALL RIGHT. BUT A DEAD CAT ON SOMEBODY'S PORCH, IT -- IT DIDN'T GET UP THERE ON ITS OWN. ALONG WITH THE THREATENING NOTES, IT WAS JUST ONE ESCALATION AFTER ANOTHER. YEAH, TELL HIM ABOUT TONY CINCONE. I THINK THAT A MAN NAMED ANTHONY CINCONE MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS BEING STALKED BY A -- A PERSON KNOWN TO US AS TONY CINCONE. BRIAN SAID, "IF YOU GUYS AREN'T GONNA DO SOMETHING, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF." SOME PEOPLE DO, TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. THE POLICE BRING TONY CINCONE IN FOR QUESTIONING. MR. CINCONE... THEY ASK HIM TO PROVIDE A HANDWRITING SAMPLE, HOPING IT WILL PROVE IF HE IS THE MAN BEHIND THE THREATS. YOU'RE GONNA WRITE DOWN WHAT I TELL YOU ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER HERE. TONY CINCONE STRONGLY DENIES EVERYTHING. SO I'VE KNOWN THIS GUY EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEN LESLIE SAID THAT TONY WAS STALKING HER, THAT'S KINDA WHAT TONY DOES. A FAIRLY ATTRACTIVE GIRL... HE'LL GO UP AND MAKE SMALL TALK. AND HE'S KINDA CREEPY TOWARDS WOMEN. BUT TO DO ANY KIND OF THREATENING, TO LEAVE NOTES, TO SAY, "I'M GONNA KILL YA." TONY CINCONE WASN'T THE PERSON. BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS MORE TO IT THAN MET THE EYE. I REALLY DID. AND I WAS VERY CONCERNED FOR HER AND HER FAMILY. AT THE SAME TIME CINCONE IS BEING INTERROGATED, BRIAN AND LESLIE LONG SHOW UP AT THE POLICE STATION. HI, I NEED TO MAKE A REPORT. WE ENDED UP AT THE STATION WHEN THEY WERE INTERVIEWING TONY CINCONE AND THEY BROUGHT HIM OUT. SO THEN I -- I GOT TO GET A LOOK AT HIM. THAT'S HIM! WELL, DON'T WORRY, THEY HAVE HIM NOW. LESLIE GENUINELY SEEMED SCARED. NO, THEY DON'T. LESLIE AND BRIAN WITNESSED THE POLICE RELEASING THE PERSON THEY BLAMED FOR THEIR STALKING NIGHTMARE. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE. I'M TERRIFIED, ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? I'M SORRY, MRS. LONG. LESLIE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED. TONY CINCONE DIDN'T LOOK AT EITHER ONE OF US, HE JUST KEPT HIS HEAD DOWN. LET'S GO, COME ON. WHEN I SAW HIM GO, I FELT SOME RAGE. I WANTED TO CRACK HIM. THREE MONTHS PASS. THE STALKING OF LESLIE APPEARS TO HAVE STOPPED, AND LIFE RETURNS TO NORMAL. BRIAN AND HIS SON CONTINUE THEIR THURSDAY NIGHT KARATE CLASS. HEY. HEY, YOU GUYS HAVE FUN AT, YOUR DAD'S BARBECUE. I STILL GOT THE BLACK BELT CLASS. - YOU SURE YOU CAN'T COME? - YEAH, ENJOY YOURSELVES. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL SEE YOU AT HOME LATER. ALL RIGHT, BYE. SEE YA. AFTER THAT KARATE CLASS IS OVER, I STOP AT A PIZZA SHOP AND GRAB A COUPLE BOTTLES OF BEER, AND I HEAD HOME. I PULL UP IN THE DRIVE. AND I HIT THE GARAGE DOOR OPENER, BUT THERE'S NO LIGHT. AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, THAT'S STRANGE. THAT BULB MUST BE BURNT OUT." BRIAN FINDS HIMSELF IN PITCH BLACK, AND ALL IS DEATHLY QUIET. SO I WALK IN THE HOUSE. AND I FLIP THE SWITCH FOR THE OVERHEAD LIGHTS AND THEY DON'T WORK. I THOUGHT, "BOY, THAT'S REALLY ODD." BRIAN WALKS FROM THE GARAGE INTO THE KITCHEN. I HAD MY WORK BOOTS ON LIKE I DO EVERY DAY. AND I'M BENT OVER UNTYING MY BOOT. AND I HEAR FOOTSTEPS ON THE HARDWOOD FLOOR. AND I THOUGHT," THIS CAN'T BE GOOD." AND JUST AS I STAND UP, I SEE THE FLASH OF THE GUN AND THE BULLET HITS ME RIGHT IN THE STOMACH. IF I HADN'T IMMEDIATELY STOOD UP, THAT BULLET WOULDA HIT ME RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THE HEAD. IT WAS EXCRUCIATING PAIN FROM THE HEAT OF THE BULLET SEARING MY SKIN. THAT -- THAT HURT MORE THAN THE BULLET ENTERING MY BODY. I ALREADY KNOW I HAVE TO START RUNNING. SO I JUST TAKE OFF AND HE FIRES AGAIN. THE SECOND BULLET HURT WAY WORSE BECAUSE IT SHATTERED THAT ELBOW AND UPPER FOREARM. SO I'M RUNNING, AND MY ARM'S JUST FLOPPING. MY BIGGEST CONCERN WAS GETTING TO THE OUTSIDE OF THAT HOUSE AND MAKING AS MUCH NOISE AS I POSSIBLY COULD. IT'S LOCKED. I WAS ON AN ADRENALINE RUSH, AND MY WILL TO SURVIVE KICKED IN. YOU CAN EITHER LAY DOWN TO DIE OR GET YOUR FEET MOVING. AND I BREAK THROUGH THAT DOOR. AND I RUN DOWN THE YARD. AND I'M SCREAMING, "SOMEBODY HELP ME! SOMEBODY HELP ME!" HELP! I'M MAKING AS MUCH NOISE AS I CAN. SOMEBODY! I RUN ABOUT 80 YARDS TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. AND I KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SHE ANSWERS THE DOOR. AND I SAID, "CAN YOU HELP ME? I'VE BEEN SHOT." SHE HAD SAID, "MY GOD, GET IN HERE." AND LAYS ME DOWN IN THE FOYER. AND I LOOK DOWN AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BLEED TO DEATH. AND I JUST START PRAYING. THE LADY THAT LIVED AT THE HOUSE WAS A NURSE. AND I CAN REMEMBER 'EM GIVING ME COMPRESSES TO PUT ON MY STOMACH. I DON'T WANNA DIE. IT SEEMED LIKE IT TOOK FOREVER FOR THE AMBULANCE TO GET THERE. I CAN JUST REMEMBER LAYING THERE, PRAYING TO GOD THAT THEY WOULD GET ME TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME. I WAS CONSCIOUS THE WHOLE TIME. I DID THINK THAT I WAS GONNA DIE. IN ST. CLAIRSVILLE, OHIO, SOMEONE IS TERRORIZING THE LONG FAMILY. THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR OLD LESLIE HAS BEEN RECEIVING THREATENING NOTES. AND NOW HER HUSBAND, BRIAN, HAS BEEN SHOT IN HIS OWN HOME BY AN INTRUDER. BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL, UM, LESLIE WAS ALREADY THERE FOLLOWING ALONG BESIDE THE GURNEY. STAY WITH ME, BABY. THEY NEED TO OPERATE NOW. SHE WAS CRYING AS THEY'RE TAKING ME TO SURGERY. AND THEY TOLD HER, "YOU CAN'T GO IN." SHE GAVE ME A KISS ON THE CHEEK AND THEN THEY TOOK ME IN. THEY GAVE ME THE ANESTHESIA. AND THAT WAS IT, I WAS OUT. HIS YOUNG CHILDREN, TYLER AND COURTNEY, CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD SHOOT THEIR FATHER. WHEN I HEARD HE HAD BEEN SHOT, IT -- IT WAS LIKE I GOT HIT BY A BUS. IT WAS -- IT WAS SO HARD TO HEAR THAT. IS DAD GONNA DIE? NO. NO, SWEETIE. DADDY'S STRONG. WHEN SHE TOLD ME, I REALLY WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK. BUT I WAS SCARED. AND I WANTED TO SEE HIM. I'M PRAYING FOR DADDY. HE'S GONNA BE OKAY. I HAD LOST SO MUCH BLOOD THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FIND OUT WHERE THE BULLET WAS. SO THEY HAD TO SEW ME BACK UP WITH THAT BULLET INSIDE OF ME. THAT BULLET IS STILL THERE. WHEN BRIAN WAKES UP FROM SURGERY... MR. LONG? MR. LONG. YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL. YOU AND I SPOKE RIGHT BEFORE YOU WENT INTO THE AMBULANCE. THE POLICE ARE WAITING TO INTERVIEW HIM ON THE SPOT. THEY ARE SURE BRIAN MUST HAVE SEEN HIS ATTACKER. MR. LONG. WHEN I WOKE UP, THE FIRST PERSON I REMEMBER SEEING WAS OFFICER CLARK AND HE'S ASKING ME, "WHO DID THIS TO YOU?" YOU TOLD ME YOU SAW HIS FACE. WHO SHOT YOU? I DON'T KNOW. HE'S YELLING AT ME, "YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS TO YOU. PEOPLE DON'T JUST DO THIS FOR NO REASON. HE WASN'T THERE TO ROB YOU, HE WAS THERE TO KILL YOU." SURE YOU DO. THIS WAS NOT A ROBBERY. AS FAR AS THE LETTERS, THE DEAD CARCASS BEING LEFT... WE WERE AWARE SOMETHING HAD TO BE CONNECTED. MR. LONG. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT A FEW PERSONAL THINGS. I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, WHO YOU OWE MONEY TO... WE ASKED IF HE COULD GIVE US ANY INSIGHT WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN, WHO WOULD DO THIS, WHETHER HE HAD UPSET SOMEBODY DOING A BUSINESS DEAL. WHY ARE THE POLICE SHOUTING AT HIM? THEY THINK HE KNOWS STUFF. STUPID. HE GOT SHOT. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU OWE MONEY TO? ALTHOUGH BRIAN IS STILL DROWSY, HE KNOWS THE POLICE ARE SUSPICIOUS OF HIM. HE WAS THINKING, "WAS THIS A DRUG DEAL GONE WRONG? WHAT WAS THIS? WHAT DID YOU DO TO GET YOURSELF SHOT?" YOU NEED TO START TALKING NOW. I WAS PISSED OFF. I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE TONE THAT THEY -- THEY WERE TAKING. DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS NOW? AS FAR AS WHETHER I BELIEVED HIM, NO. ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PRIOR INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED. WE KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON. MR. LONG, YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME SOMETHING. I JUST WANT HIM TO GO AWAY 'CAUSE I JUST, I NEEDED TO SLEEP. I WANNA SEE MY KIDS. I'LL GO GET THEM. MR. LONG, YOU NEED TO START ANSWERING... LESLIE WAS JUST AS CONFUSED ABOUT WHY THIS HAPPENED AND -- AND WHO COULDA DONE IT. I JUST WANNA SEE MY KIDS. WE'LL BE BACK, MR. LONG. LET'S GO. WHEN I SAW TYLER AND COURTNEY, THEY WERE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE ME. HEY. I DO REMEMBER BUSTING OUT CRYING AND, HE JUST -- HE JUST SAID, "I'M OKAY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I LOVE YOU." I GOT UPSET BECAUSE I HATED SEEING MY DAD IN THE PAIN THAT HE WAS IN. AS LESLIE AND THE KIDS STAY AT BRIAN'S BEDSIDE, THE POLICE COMB THE CRIME SCENE. I WAS VERY SHOCKED HOW IT ENDED UP. I FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN, BUT I -- I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GONNA BE THIS. IT'S A MESS. LET'S WALK THROUGH THIS. I THOUGHT EITHER THE WHOLE FAMILY OR -- OR SHE WAS GONNA BE THE -- THE, VICTIM. HE OBVIOUSLY CHASED HIM 'CAUSE HE'S THROWING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE DIRECTION IN WHICH BRIAN FLED WAS INDICATED BY PIZZA THAT WAS COUGHED UP THAT LED TOWARDS THE BACK. BANK STATEMENTS AND, A DRAWER OF RECEIPTS. HE CAN SPEND AS WELL AS EARN. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD FOR A GUY WHO SELLS HAMMERS. THE POLICE SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE THAT PROVES BRIAN KNOWS MORE THAN HE IS SAYING. WE WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE COMPUTER THAT WOULD LEAD US TO THE SUSPECT. SO THAT'S WHEN WE CONFISCATED THE COMPUTER. HE'S DEFINITELY NOT TELLING US THE WHOLE STORY HERE. WE KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON, WE JUST COULDN'T PUT A -- A -- FINGER ON IT. LESLIE RETURNS TO THE HOUSE JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE POLICE TAKING THEIR COMPUTERS. OFFICER CLARK, WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S JUST PART OF OUR INVESTIGATION. NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT. MY HUSBAND DOES BUSINESS ON HIS COMPUTER. - SO DO I, I... - WELL, THIS IS, OUR BUSINESS NOW. WHEN LESLIE CALLS BRIAN, HE'S NOT HAPPY TO HEAR THAT HIS ENTIRE LIFE, INCLUDING WORK, IS NOW UNDER POLICE SCRUTINY. BRIAN, THE -- THE POLICE ARE AT OUR HOUSE. THEY'RE TAKING OUR COMPUTERS. THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THAT. IT DID MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS UNDER SUSPICION. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TONE OF, "WHAT DID YOU DO TO GET YOURSELF SHOT?" AND IT, YOU KNOW, IT MADE ME PRETTY ANGRY. I'M THE ONE WHO GOT SHOT. JUST CALM DOWN, HONEY. DON'T GET WORKED UP. YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON GETTING BETTER. I SAID, "BUT THEY'RE TREATING ME LIKE I SOMEHOW BROUGHT THIS ON MYSELF." AND I NEEDED TO GET MY WORK COMPUTER BACK SO I COULD AT LEAST CHECK E-MAILS. TELL 'EM -- TELL 'EM THEY'LL NEED WARRANTS TO TAKE ANYTHING. I WOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER STARTING THAT UP. WE WERE NOTIFIED BY A LOCAL ATTORNEY THAT THEY WANTED THE LAPTOP COMPUTER RETURNED. AND BRIAN DID NOT WANT TO SPEAK TO US, AND FOR US JUST TO LEAVE HIM ALONE. THEY'VE REFUSED ANY MORE INTERVIEWS WITHOUT THEIR LAWYER PRESENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT SUSPICION OF BRIAN INCREASES. I'M WONDERING WHAT HE'S HIDING. HE WAS BEING VERY EVASIVE. THEY WERE HIDING SOMETHING, WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT. WHILE POLICE GATHER EVIDENCE ON BRIAN LONG TO JUSTIFY A SEARCH WARRANT, THEY HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH. ST. CLAIRSVILLE POLICE. A CALL FROM AN INVESTIGATOR WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE. I THINK I'VE GOT A SNITCH THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU. THERE WAS A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT WHO HAD INFORMATION ABOUT AN ATTEMPTED HOMICIDE THAT HAPPENED IN OHIO. HOLD ON. A CO-WORKER OF HIS HAD BEEN GIVING HIM INFORMATION ABOUT AN ATTEMPT TO KILL MR. LONG. - CLARK. - DOES THE NAME JOHN JAWORSKI MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? DOES THE NAME JOHN JAWORSKI MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? - NO. - NO? WELL, IT WILL. THE INFORMANT REVEALED THAT JOHN JAWORSKI HAD BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT GETTING AWAY WITH THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF BRIAN LONG. REALLY? HOW RELIABLE IS YOUR SNITCH? MOST CRIMINALS GET THEMSELVES CAUGHT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR MOUTH SHUT. IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE BEAST. WE APPRECIATE IT. ON A QUIET MORNING 4 MONTHS AFTER THE SHOOTING IN SARVER, PENNSYLVANIA, OFFICERS CLARK AND HENRY JOINT CORPORAL BEVERLY ASHTON TO BUST JAWORSKI. JOHN JAWORSKI, POLICE! PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! LISTEN. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. CORPORAL BEVERLEY ASHTON PROCEEDS TO PLACE THEIR PRIME SUSPECT UNDER ARREST. I'M NOT GOING DOWN FOR THIS ALONE. I THINK HE WAS MORE SURPRISED THAN ANYTHING ELSE. WE FOUND 50 PRE-WRITTEN NOTES THAT MATCHED THE PAPER AND -- AND WRITING IN THE JAWORSKI RESIDENCE. HE ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO CALL HIS MOTHER, AND THEN HE GAVE US A FULL WRITTEN STATEMENT. BUT HARD-WORKING CONSTRUCTION MANAGER JOHN JAWORSKI IS AN UNLIKELY ASSASSIN. AS FAR AS HIM BEING THE KILLER-TYPE, NO. TO THE POLICE, IT DOESN'T ADD UP UNTIL A SCARED JAWORSKI REVEALS THE INCREDIBLE TRUTH. IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. BRIAN LONG IS RECOVERING FROM HIS INJURIES AFTER BEING SHOT BY AN INTRUDER IN HIS HOME. BUT HE STILL HASN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE POLICE ABOUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK. TIME'S MOVING ON, AND NOTHINGS HAPPENING. YOU KNOW, NOT A PEEP OUT OF THE POLICE. SO I, YOU KNOW, I WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATED. I THOUGHT, "WHY HAVEN'T THEY CAUGHT THIS GUY YET?" THEN, MONTHS AFTER THE SHOOTING, THE COUPLE GETS THE CALL THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. ONE DAY, I GET A CALL FROM CHRIS BERHALTER, AND HE SAID, "THEY MADE AN ARREST IN YOUR CASE." THEY GOT HIM? SOME GUY NAMED JOHN JAWORSKI. SO IMMEDIATELY, I'M THINKING, "WELL, MAYBE HE WAS THERE TO ROB ME," BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS. BUT THEY, THEY WANT ME TO COME IN. DO YOU THINK DADDY DID SOMETHING BAD? WE ADVISED HIM WE WOULD BE PRESENTING WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAD TO THE GRAND JURY, AND WE WANTED HIM TO BE PRESENT. AT THIS POINT, HE DID NOT KNOW THE EVIDENCE WE HAD UNCOVERED. THE DAY OF THE GRAND JURY, BRIAN IS NERVOUS AND WANTS LESLIE THERE TO SUPPORT HIM. THE DAY THAT THE GRAND JURY IS MEETING, LESLIE WAS -- WAS GONNA RIDE TO THE JUSTICE CENTER WITH ME. HEY, LES, WHERE ARE YOU? I'M RUNNING LATE. DAD WASN'T ON TIME. HE HAD TO PICK UP THE KIDS. SHE SAYS, "I'M RUNNING BEHIND. I'M RUNNING BEHIND." AND I'M NOT GONNA BE LATE FOR THIS -- I WANNA SEE THIS. NO, NO, GO AHEAD. THIS IS IMPORTANT. OKAY, BYE. MR. LONG. HI, YEAH. CAN I HAVE A MOMENT WITH YOU, PLEASE? AND CHRIS BERHALTER SPOTS ME. AND HE SAID, "MR. LONG, I NEED YOU TO COME WITH ME," YOU KNOW, "WE NEED TO GO IN HERE AND TALK." MY WIFE'S JUST RUNNING BEHIND HERE. SHE SHOULD BE HERE SOON. I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN THE OTHER ROOM. PLEASE COME WITH ME. WE GO INTO THIS ROOM. AND THEN... HAVE A SEAT. A COUPLE ST. CLAIRSVILLE OFFICERS AND FOUR OR FIVE DEPUTIES ARE IN THE ROOM. I'M STARTING TO THINK, "YEAH, THIS PROBABLY ISN'T GONNA BE GOOD." LESLIE IS STILL MAKING HER WAY TO THE JUSTICE CENTER. HI, DAD. ARE THE KIDS OKAY? I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS. CHRIS SITS ME DOWN IN THE ROOM. AND HE SAID, "MR. LONG, I HAVE GOOD NEW FOR YOU. WE'VE SOLVED YOUR CASE." WELL, THAT'S GREAT. ISN'T IT? I'M ALMOST AT THE JUSTICE CENTER. THERE IS ONE MORE PIECE OF INFORMATION, THOUGH. I'VE GOTTA GO. I'M BEING PULLED OVER. THE MAN WE ARRESTED... YEAH, JOHN JAWORSKI? WHO IS HE? I DON'T KNOW HIM FROM ADAM. WELL, YOUR WIFE DOES. I EXPLAINED THE CONNECTION OF MR. JAWORSKI, TO HIS WIFE. THEY MET ONLINE. THEY HAD AN AFFAIR. I'M SORRY, BUT THE PERSON WHO ORGANIZED THE PLOT TO KILL YOU IS YOUR WIFE. AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE HAD AN ACTIVE ROLE, IN THIS MURDER PLOT. HE APPEARED TO BE IN A STATE OF SHOCK. AND I SLAMMED THE TABLE. AND I SAID, "IF SHE WAS HERE RIGHT NOW, I'D CHOKE HER." I WAS SHOCKED. I DIDN'T THINK LESLIE WAS CAPABLE OF MURDER. OFFICER, WHAT'S -- WHAT'S GOING ON? ALL THE WAY UP TO THIS POINT, BRIAN HAD NO IDEA OF HER INVOLVEMENT. TELL THE KIDS I LOVE THEM. HE WAS VERY STUNNED. VERY MAD. HE WANTED TO SEE HER, WANTED TO SPEAK TO HER RIGHT THEN. HE WAS FULL OF EMOTIONS. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. ARE YOU -- ARE YOU ARRESTING ME? I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING TOLD THAT YOUR WIFE WAS INVOLVED IN A PLOT TO HAVE YOU KILLED. WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME? WHERE ARE WE GOING? YOUR SPOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR BESET FRIEND, YOU PARTNER, AND SOMEONE YOU TRUST. AFTER MONTHS OF FEELING LIKE A SUSPECT HIMSELF, BRIAN LEARNS WHAT HAS REALLY BEEN GOING ON. CHRIS CONFIRMED THAT JOHN JAWORSKI WAS HER BOYFRIEND. YOU KNOW, SHE MET ON THE INTERNET. THEY REVEAL HOW LESLIE ONCE TOOK THE CHILDREN TO MEET JOHN JAWORSKI. YOU GUYS CAN CALL ME JJ. AND MADE THEM KEEP IT A SECRET. I WAS REALLY ANGRY. ...IT HAS TO END. I WANT HIM DEAD. THEN, LESLIE HATCHED A PLOT TO KILL BRIAN FOR HIS INSURANCE MONEY. IT DID START TO MAKE SENSE. MONTHS PRIOR, LESLIE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GONNA UP MY INSURANCE PREMIUMS. SO FOR A COUPLE WEEKENDS IN A ROW THEY TESTED ME FOR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY. WHEN SHE WAS ARRESTED, THERE WAS ALMOST $1 MILLION WORTH OF LIFE INSURANCE. LESLIE AND JAWORSKI INVENTED THE THREATENING NOTES AND PLANTED THE DEAD CAT TO AVOID SUSPICION AND PRETEND THAT LESLIE WAS THE ONE BEING TARGETED. THE NEXT PART IN THE PLOT WAS TO INCRIMINATE AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER, TONY CINCONE. I FEEL BAD FOR TONY CINCONE BECAUSE HE GOT DRUG INTO THIS MESS AND -- AND ALL HE WAS DOING WAS PROBABLY JUST STANDING IN THE LIBRARY. BRIAN ALSO LEARNS THAT IT WASN'T JUST LESLIE AND JAWORSKI WHO PLOTTED THE ATTEMPTED MURDER. THEY CONTRACTED A KILLER NAMED RICHARD CAVANAUGH TO ACTUALLY PULL THE TRIGGER. THIS GUY HIRED A FRIEND FOR $5,000 TO SHOOT BRIAN LONG, AND, AND I SAID, "WOW." BRIAN NOW HAS THE DAUNTING TASK OF OF TELLING THE DEVASTATING TRUTH TO HIS CHILDREN, TYLER AND COURTNEY, WHO ARE BEING LOOKED AFTER BY THEIR GRANDFATHER. YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST THINGS I EVER HAD TO DO. MOMMY DID A REALLY BAD THING. THERE'S NO WAY TO SUGARCOAT TELLING TWO YOUNG CHILDREN THAT, YOU KNOW, "YOUR MOTHER'S DONE THIS, AND SHE'S GOING AWAY." SHE TRIED TO HAVE DADDY KILLED. MOMMY WOULDN'T DO THAT. I JUST THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT THIS CAN'T BE REAL. I WAS SCARED AND CONFUSED. AND I STARTED CRYING. I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER UNDERSTAND WHY MY MOM DID WHAT SHE DID. I DO THINK THAT THERE WAS A REASON SHE WAS UNHAPPY. I NEVER KNEW WHY, BUT I DEFINITELY THINK SHE WAS UNHAPPY. LESLIE LONG, HER LOVER, JOHN JAWORSKI, AND THE SHOOTER, RICHARD CAVANAUGH ALL PLEAD GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER. JAWORSKI IS SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS IN PRISON. THE HIRED KILLER, RICHARD CAVANAUGH, IS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS. AND LESLIE IS SENTENCED TO 9 YEARS IN PRISON. IT -- IT TOOK YEARS BEFORE THE SHOCK WENT AWAY. I'M STILL SHOCKED. SINCE THE REVELATION, BRIAN HAS REMARRIED, AND TYLER AND COURTNEY HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE. THEY SEE EACH OTHER OFTEN, STILL TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE PAST. - HI, GUYS. - HI! HOW YA DOING, DAD? I -- I DIDN'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE IT HAD COME FROM. BUT LOVE CAN GROW INTO HATE, AND I THINK THAT IT HAPPENED ON BOTH OF OUR PARTS. TODAY, LESLIE LONG IS A FREE WOMAN. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN COME TO TERMS TO FORGIVE HER, BUT RIGHT NOW, I HAVEN'T. SHE'S TORN MY FAMILY APART, AND I'VE NEVER -- I NEVER HAD A HOME.
