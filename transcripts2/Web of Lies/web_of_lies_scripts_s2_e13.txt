 WHEN SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR. HE WAS EXPOSED TO SOME THINGS NO CHILD SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO. Narrator: WHEN LEE FOUND OUT HIS SON HAD WITNESSED HIS WIFE'S INFIDELITY, HE EXPLODED WITH RAGE. Lee: I ASSAULTED THE GUY WHO WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MY WIFE. SO NOW HE DIDN'T HAVE A DAD. I WAS IN JAIL. Narrator: WITH HIS DAD IN PRISON, ROBERT WAS SENT TO LIVE WITH HIS GRANDPARENTS ON THEIR RANCH 16 MILES OUTSIDE ELLENSBURG. WHEN LEE WAS RELEASED, HE WORKED OUT OF TOWN ON CONSTRUCTION JOBS. SO, ROBERT STAYED ON THE RANCH. HE REALLY FELT THE RANCH WAS A PRISON FOR HIM, THAT HE COULDN'T GET INTO TOWN TO SOCIALIZE WITH HIS FRIENDS MORE. HEY, BOBBY, YOU WANT SOME SUPPER? NO THANKS. I'M NOT HUNGRY. ARE YOU SURE? I MADE YOUR FAVORITE... CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS. I'M GOOD, GRANDMA. Narrator: ISOLATED AND WITH NO FRIENDS HIS AGE NEARBY, ROBERT STARTS REACHING OUT ONLINE. Bernice: I THINK ROBERT'S WHOLE THING WITH THE COMPUTER WAS THAT HE COULD INTERACT WITH THE YOUNGER GENERATION. HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH THEM AT HOME. SO, I THINK THE COMPUTER HELPED HIM GET THAT CONTACT WITH PEOPLE, MORE OF HIS PEERS. Narrator: EVERY NIGHT, ROBERT LOGS ONTO A MULTIPLAYER GAME AS ELEMENTAL EVIL... A CHARACTER EQUIPPED WITH SUPERPOWERS WHO GOES ON CRIME-FIGHTING MISSIONS IN A VIRTUAL CITY. TONIGHT, HE'S FLYING AROUND WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN THAT WILL CHANGE HIS LIFE FOREVER. ICE PRINCESS LIVES 2,000 MILES AWAY IN GAHANNA, A SUBURB OF COLUMBUS, OHIO. HER REAL NAME IS GRACE DILLMAN. SHE SAYS SHE'S 16, A YEAR OR SO OLDER THAN ROBERT. THEY SEEM TO BOND IMMEDIATELY. Mash: BOB WAS LOOKING FOR FRIENDS. I DON'T THINK HE EVER THOUGHT HE COULD MEET SOMEBODY LIKE GRACE, WHO HE FELT FOR. BUT I ALSO DON'T THINK HE WAS REALLY PURSUING IT AT FIRST. BOBBY, TIME FOR BED, HON. OKAY, GRANDMA. GIVE ME JUST A SEC, OKAY? Narrator: GRACE AND ROBERT START CHATTING REGULARLY. THEY EXCHANGE E-MAIL ADDRESSES. SOON, THEY BEGIN TO SHARE THE DETAILS OF THEIR LIVES. GRACE TALKS ABOUT HER FAMILY AND BEING HOMESCHOOLED. SHE FEELS NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HER. ROBERT EXPLAINS HIS SENSE OF ISOLATION OUT ON THE RANCH. THE MORE THEY CHAT, THEY DISCOVER IT'S EASY TO OPEN UP TO EACH OTHER. OVER TIME, THEIR FEELINGS DEEPEN. IT WAS JUST A GAME TO HIM AT FIRST, JUST SOMEBODY TO TALK TO. BUT THEN IT TURNED INTO SOMETHING MORE. Narrator: INCREASINGLY, IT SEEMS LIKE GRACE IS THE ONLY GOOD THING IN ROBERT'S LIFE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING DOWNHILL. Bernice: THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN HE WAS BUMPING HIS HEAD AGAINST HIS DAD, HE SAID. AND THE COMPUTER GOT MORE IMPORTANT. GRADES GOT LESS IMPORTANT. Narrator: ROBERT BEGINS STAYING UP LATE ON THE COMPUTER AND TEXTING GRACE IN SECRET THROUGH THE NIGHT. HIS DAD ISN'T AWARE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, BUT HE'S WORRIED THAT WITH ROBERT SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ONLINE, IT WILL AFFECT HIS STUDIES. BOBBY'S EDUCATION WAS HUGELY IMPORTANT TO ME. HEY, MISTER. YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS? IT'S THE WEEKEND. WHAT DO YOU CARE? YES, ROBERT, I KNOW IT'S THE WEEKEND. AND I KNOW YOU GOT SCHOOL WORK. YOU KNOW YOU DO. LOOK, I WORK MY BUTT OFF SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK CONSTRUCTION LIKE ME AND YOUR GRANDFATHER. I WAS IN A POSITION WHERE I WANTED MY SON TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND NOT DO WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. I MEAN, I MAKE A GOOD LIVING, BUT THE END RESULT IS YOU'RE GONNA BE CRIPPLED. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA WEAR YOUR BODY OUT. YOU'RE GONNA BE IN A LOT OF PAIN. HEY, MISTER. DO YOU HEAR ME? YES, SIR. SO I WAS PRETTY HARD ON HIM, EDUCATION-WISE. PRETTY FOCUSED. YOU GOT TO GET GOOD GRADES. YOU GOT TO STUDY. Narrator: BUT ROBERT IS TOO OBSESSED WITH GRACE DILLMAN, HIS ICE PRINCESS, TO CARE MUCH ABOUT SCHOOL WORK. BUT WOULD SHE REALLY WANT TO BE WITH HIM? SHE'S OLDER FROM A WEALTHY FAMILY. IS SHE OUT OF HIS LEAGUE? THEN, A YEAR AFTER THEY BEGIN CHATTING, GRACE DROPS A BOMBSHELL. WHEN BOB FOUND OUT ABOUT GRACE LYING ABOUT HER AGE, HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND UPSET THAT ANOTHER WOMAN HAD LIED TO HIM AND HE TRIED TO PUSH HER AWAY. Narrator: FOR ALMOST A YEAR AFTER BREAKING UP WITH GRACE, ROBERT THROWS HIMSELF INTO A NEW PASSION... FIXING TRUCKS WITH HIS GRANDPA. Lee: HIS MECHANICS CAME ABOUT WITH HIS SENIOR PROJECT. I HAD A FEW CLASSIC RIGS OUT THERE. AND WHEN HE TURNED 16, I SAYS, "YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK." SO HE TOOK ONE OF THE TRUCKS, TORE DOWN THE ENGINE. THEY REPAIRED IT, GOT IT COMPLETELY RUNNING, AND HE FOUND HE LIKED THAT. Narrator: HE'D RECENTLY BROKEN UP WITH A LOCAL GIRL AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF DATING. ARE YOU STILL SAD ABOUT CHRISTIE? GRANDMA, I'M OKAY REALLY. IN FACT, ROBERT IS BACK IN TOUCH WITH GRACE, DESPITE HER LYING ABOUT JUST HOW YOUNG SHE IS. I DON'T THINK ROBERT WOULD HAVE WENT AFTER GRACE, BUT SHE KEPT PURSUING HIM. AND AFTER A WHILE, HE HAD THAT IMAGE OF HER IN HIS HEAD... THE MATURE, YOUNG WOMAN WHO HE THOUGHT SHE WAS. Narrator: WHILE ROBERT TELLS GRACE ABOUT HIS EX, CHRISTIE, SHE TELLS HIM ABOUT SOMEONE SHE'S FALLEN FOR WHO HE'S NICKNAMED ROMEO. INTRIGUED, ROBERT CAN'T HELP BUT ASK GRACE THREE QUESTIONS. THEN, ROBERT PLUCKS UP THE COURAGE TO ASK HIS FINAL QUESTION. I MUST BE CRAZY. Mash: I THINK HE WENT BACK TO HER BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GO BACK TO HER. HE HAD THAT IMAGE OF HER IN HIS HEAD, AND HE COULDN'T GET IT OUT. AND IT JUST DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM ANYMORE. Narrator: IT'S A RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL LEAD ROBERT INTO A DARKNESS HE IS TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR. HE HAD FALLEN SO FAR IN LOVE WITH HER, HE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING. Narrator: ROBERT BEST AND GRACE DILLMAN HAVE REKINDLED AN ONLINE RELATIONSHIP AND DECLARED THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER. BY SPRING 2010, ROBERT IS 18 AND GRACE IS 14. THEY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT ON AND OFF FOR THREE YEARS, AND THEY'VE BEEN OFFICIALLY DATING ONLINE FOR OVER A YEAR. THEIR PARENTS STILL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. THEY TALK EVERY DAY, MAKING IT EASY TO FORGET THEY LIVE 2,000 MILES APART. Narrator: ONE AFTERNOON, ROBERT, WHO JUST GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, COMES UP WITH A PLAN THAT COULD BRING HIM CLOSER TO GRACE WITHOUT HIS FAMILY KNOWING ABOUT IT. WHAT IF HE COULD GO TO MECHANICS SCHOOL IN OHIO, GRACE'S HOME STATE? HE FINDS WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR ONLINE... OHIO TECH, A COLLEGE IN CLEVELAND JUST TWO HOURS' DRIVE FROM COLUMBUS WHERE GRACE LIVES. HEY, DAD, COME HERE. ROBERT'S DAD IS VISITING FOR THE WEEKEND. WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE, SON? Lee: THEY WERE THE NUMBER-ONE RATED AUTO MECHANIC SCHOOL. LIKE MOST PARENTS, I WANT THE BEST FOR MY SON. IT'S THE BEST AUTOMOTIVE PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. THAT'S GREAT. I LOOK AT IT AND GO, "WOW, OKAY." SO, TOP SCHOOL IN THE NATION, TOP QUALITY TRAINING. YOU'RE GONNA COME OUT OF THERE, YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING A JOB ARE JUST FANTASTIC. I THINK IT'S THE ONE. Narrator: AS SUMMER ENDS, ROBERT MAKES THE 2,000 MILE JOURNEY FROM WASHINGTON STATE TO CLEVELAND, OHIO. Mash: ROBERT CAME TO OHIO FOR GRACE, AND AN 18-MONTH COURSE AT OHIO TECHNICAL COLLEGE WAS THE BEST AND FASTEST AND EASIEST WAY TO GET HER. Narrator: AFTER A WEEK OF DRIVING, HE ARRIVES IN CLEVELAND. AT LAST, HE'S WITHIN REACH OF THE GIRL HE LOVES. IT WAS HIS LIFE DREAM TO BE WITH GRACE. Narrator: GRACE AND ROBERT WASTE NO TIME ARRANGING TO MEET. NOW 15, GRACE IS STILL A MINOR. SHE DECIDES TO LIE TO HER PARENTS. SHE DOESN'T THINK THEY WILL APPROVE IF SHE TELLS THEM HOW SHE AND ROBERT MET ONLINE OR HOW MANY YEARS THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER. GRACE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A VERY STRICT, RELIGIOUS HOME. IT WAS A WEALTHY HOME. BUT GRACE WAS HOMESCHOOLED MOST OF THE TIME. GRACE, HURRY UP! WE'RE LATE. AND SO SHE WAS QUITE ISOLATED MUCH OF THE TIME FROM HER PEERS. GRACE, COME ON. Narrator: SINCE HER PARENTS ARE DEVOUT CHRISTIANS, GRACE DECIDES MEETING ROBERT AT CHURCH IS THE BEST OPTION. Mash: ON THE WAY, BOB FELT ANXIOUS AND EXCITED. AND MOST LIKELY HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GONNA GET WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE THAT'S BOB'S LIFE. HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS. Narrator: AT THE CHURCH IN GAHANNA, ROBERT GETS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LUCKY BREAK. HE SEES A MAN AT THE DOOR WHOM HE GUESSES IS GRACE'S FATHER. YOU MUST BE MR. DILLMAN. I AM. AND WHO'S ASKING? I'M ROBERT. Mash: HE SHOOK ALAN'S HAND AND SAID, "HI, I'M ROBERT BEST, AND I'M HERE TO DATE YOUR DAUGHTER." YOU KNOW, GRACIE HAS BEEN TELLING US ALL ABOUT YOU. SIR, IF YOU'D JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE... LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. I'M SURE YOU'RE A NICE GUY. BUT YOU'RE WAY TOO OLD FOR GRACE. SO YOU'RE NOT TO TRY TO SEE HER OR ATTEMPT TO REACH HER IN ANY WAY. AM I UNDERSTOOD? SIR, IF YOU'D GIVE ME A CHANCE JUST TO TALK TO... ROBERT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TURN YOURSELF AROUND AND GO HOME? AND IF YOU TRY TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HER, I WILL CALL THE COPS. NOW, GO. Choung: FOLLOWING THAT INCIDENT, GRACE'S FATHER REPORTED TO THE POLICE THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HAVING AN ONLINE RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE. AFTER REVIEWING THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED, THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO CRIME TO INVESTIGATE. Narrator: FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR, ROBERT HONORS GRACE'S FATHER'S REQUEST TO STAY AWAY AND SETTLES INTO LIFE AS A COLLEGE STUDENT. HE DOESN'T TRY TO CONTACT GRACE, AND SHE KEEPS QUIET, AS WELL. BUT THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE, HE RECEIVES A MESSAGE. IT'S GRACE DEFYING HER FATHER AND REACHING OUT TO HIM ONCE MORE. ONLY THIS TIME, SHE'S TAKING STEPS TO AVOID DETECTION. SHE WOULD TEXT HIM OFF OF HER FRIENDS' PHONES, OR WHEN HER PARENTS WERE AWAY OR NOT HOME, THEY WOULD SKYPE. BUT I DON'T THINK THEY EVER TALKED ON HER OWN CELL PHONE. IT WAS ALWAYS A FRIEND'S. Narrator: PRETTY SOON, ROBERT AND GRACE ARE CHATTING REGULARLY AGAIN. HE TELLS HER ABOUT COLLEGE AND HIS ROOMMATES, AND SHE FILLS HIM IN ON LIFE AT HOME. AS THE WEEKS PASS, ROBERT FINDS HE'S FALLING FOR GRACE ONCE MORE, AND SHE RETURNS HIS FEELINGS. I wish I lived with you. I WISH YOU DID, TOO. So happy I get to see you. I miss you. I KNOW. I MISS YOU TOO. I CAN'T WAIT FOR US TO BE TOGETHER. BUT THE RELATIONSHIP THEY WANT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HER PARENTS' APPROVAL. Mash: I THOUGHT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS KIND OF DANGEROUS, BUT GRACE WAS THE MISSING PIECE TO BOB'S PUZZLE. THAT WAS THE WOMAN HE COULD TRUST. THAT WAS REALLY THE ONLY THING HE WANTED IN LIFE WAS A TRUSTWORTHY WOMAN. AND TO HIM, SHE WAS IT. Narrator: THEN, ONE NIGHT, GRACE DECIDES TO TEST ROBERT'S LOVE TO THE LIMIT. THE PLAN WAS TO REMOVE HER FAMILY FROM THE EQUATION. Narrator: ROBERT BEST'S WORLD HAS JUST TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. HIS ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN ONLINE GIRLFRIEND HAS REAPPEARED IN HIS LIFE, AND SHE'S ASKED FOR HIS HELP. BUT THE REASON BEHIND HER REQUEST IS SHOCKING. SHE SAID HER FATHER ABUSED HER SEXUALLY AND THAT HER MOTHER WOULD BEAT HER. Narrator: ROBERT FEELS A TERRIBLE KINSHIP BECAUSE OF A SECRET HIS GRANDMOTHER SHARED WITH HIM TWO YEARS EARLIER. Bernice: I WAS A VICTIM OF CHILD RAPE, ALSO. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT ROBERT WAS AWARE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE TALKED OPENLY ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT. IF HE THOUGHT SHE WAS BEING MOLESTED AND KNOWING THAT THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIS GRANDMA, THAT COULD'VE REALLY TRIPPED A TRIGGER. MOM, I WAS THINK... Shh. YOU KNOW SUNDAY DINNER IS SILENT. Mash: BOB WANTED TO SAVE GRACE. AND WHEN I ASKED, "WHY DOESN'T SHE CALL THE POLICE OR TELL SOMEBODY," HE SAID HER PARENTS WERE TOO HIGH IN POWER TO GET HER HELP... THAT NOBODY WOULD LISTEN TO HER. Narrator: WITH GRACE UNWILLING TO GO TO POLICE, ROBERT SUGGESTS THEY RUN AWAY TOGETHER. BUT SHE TELLS HIM HER PARENTS WILL ONLY COME AFTER HER. AND IF THAT HAPPENS, HER PUNISHMENT WILL BE FAR WORSE THAN ANYTHING SHE'S SUFFERED BEFORE. Mash: I THINK GRACE WAS TOO AFRAID TO RUN AWAY. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO RUN. WHAT WOULD MY EXCUSE BE? ARE THEY GONNA LOOK AT HIM FIRST? I DON'T THINK SHE REALLY EVER THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING AWAY. Narrator: OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, GRACE'S ANGER TAKES OVER. SHE SUGGESTS THE UNTHINKABLE... THAT THEY KILL HER PARENTS. THEY BOTH AGREED THAT HER PARENTS JUST HAD TO GO AND THAT THEY WERE GONNA KILL THEM. AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD GET AWAY WITH IT. Narrator: GRACE CONVINCED ROBERT THAT THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION. HER PARENTS HAVE TO DIE. Choung: GRACE DID A GREAT JOB OF PAINTING A PICTURE OF ABUSE IN THE HOME. AND ROBERT, CARING AS MUCH AS HE DID FOR HER, WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP. Narrator: IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO JUNE 2012, GRACE AND ROBERT FINE-TUNED THEIR PLANS. THEY SET A DATE AND TIME... THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13th. IT'S THE DAY BEFORE. GRACE GOES OVER THEIR FINAL CHECKLIST TO ENSURE EVERYTHING GOES SMOOTHLY. Choung: THEY HAD DETAILED THEIR PLAN, AND IT WAS SHOCKINGLY SPECIFIC, TO THE POINT WHERE GRACE WAS NOT TO TURN OFF THE HOUSE ALARM RIGHT ON AN HOUR. THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION MADE, "WELL, MAKE IT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE, 10 MINUTES BEFORE SO IT'S NOT SUSPICIOUS." GRACE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE THE OUTER GARAGE DOOR UNLOCKED SO ROBERT COULD COME IN. AND THERE WAS ALSO DISCUSSION ABOUT CHECKING THE GROUND TO SEE IF THERE WAS DUST SO FOOTPRINTS WOULDN'T APPEAR. Narrator: GRACE GIVES ROBERT AS MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE HOUSE AS SHE CAN. SHE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING TO GO WRONG TONIGHT. AS EVENING FALLS, ROBERT BEGINS HIS PREPARATIONS. AT MIDNIGHT, HE LEAVES CLEVELAND FOR THE DRIVE TO GAHANNA. GRACE WAITS EXPECTANTLY FOR THE MAN SHE'S DUBBED HER FALLEN ANGEL. Grace: "MY FALLEN ANGEL, I KNOW IT'S THE ONLY WAY, BUT I WORRY FOR HIS HUMANITY. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, A PART OF HIS HUMANITY WILL BE LOST IN THE WORLD FOREVER. EVEN HE FEARS FOR THE SAME THING." Narrator: BY 2:00 A.M., ROBERT IS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF GAHANNA LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE INCONSPICUOUS TO LEAVE HIS CAR. Choung: HE ACTUALLY PARKED ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY. AND TO AVOID DETECTION, HE DIDN'T EVEN PARK ON THE STREET WHERE THE HOUSE WAS. HE WALKED THROUGH THE WOODS. WHEN ROBERT ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE, EVERYTHING HAD BEEN GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN. THE ALARM HAD BEEN TURNED OFF. [ ALARM BEEPS ] HE ACTUALLY LEFT HIS SHOES ON TOP OF THE TRASH CAN RIGHT BY THE DOOR. THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED. HE WALKED IN. WALKED INTO THE RESIDENCE. THEY HAD ALREADY PRE-PLANNED THIS. AND HE MET GRACE. Narrator: FIVE YEARS SINCE THEIR RELATIONSHIP BEGAN, ROBERT FINALLY HAS GRACE ALL TO HIMSELF. Choung: HE SPOKE WITH HER A LITTLE BIT, AND SHE CONVINCED HIM THAT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS RIGHT. GRACE'S PARENTS BEDROOM AND HER BEDROOM ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE HOUSE. SO, HE ENDED UP WALKING ACROSS THE HALLWAY. Narrator: ROBERT BEST'S ONLINE GIRLFRIEND, GRACE DILLMAN, HAS TOLD HIM THAT HER FATHER SEXUALLY ABUSES HER AND HER MOTHER BEATS HER. THEY DECIDE MURDER IS THE ONLY WAY FOR GRACE TO ESCAPE THE TORMENT. Choung: FOR GRACE AND ROBERT TO BE TOGETHER, THE PLAN WAS TO REMOVE HER FAMILY FROM THE EQUATION. Narrator: THE PLAN IS FOR ROBERT TO SLIT THE THROAT OF GRACE'S FATHER, ALAN, FIRST. HER MOTHER IS LESS LIKELY TO PUT UP A STRUGGLE. Choung: HE ACTUALLY STOOD OVER GRACE'S FATHER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, JUST WATCHING HIM SLEEP. UNABLE TO DO WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, HE THEN LEFT. HE WALKED BACK TO GRACE'S ROOM. AND THEY HAD ANOTHER CONVERSATION. WHAT HAPPENED? I JUST COULDN'T DO IT, GRACE. I'M SORRY. THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER WAY TO DO THIS. ROBERT, THERE ISN'T. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY. AT THAT POINT, GRACE CONVINCED HIM AGAIN. YOU KNOW, "THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER IS IF YOU DO THIS." WHY WON'T YOU HELP ME? DON'T YOU LOVE ME? OF COURSE I LOVE YOU. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. I'M GOING TO NEED SOMETHING BIGGER THIS TIME. ROBERT REMARKED THAT IN ORDER TO DO THE JOB RIGHT, HE ACTUALLY NEEDED A BIGGER KNIFE. HE WENT TO THE KITCHEN, GRABBED ABOUT A SEVEN-INCH STEAK KNIFE. AND ACTUALLY, HE PICKED UP A BLANKET. AND HIS COMMENT WAS THAT HE NEEDED SOMETHING TO CONTAIN THE ARTERIAL SPRAY. YOU READY? YEAH. ROBERT AND GRACE RE-ENTERED THE BEDROOM. HE HAD THE STEAK KNIFE WITH HIM, AND A BLANKET. AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT BLANKET ACTUALLY RUBBED AGAINST GRACE'S FATHER'S LEG, WHICH WOKE HIM UP. WHAT WAS THAT? GET OUT OF HERE. [ SCREAMING ] HAVING SEEN ROBERT, HE CHARGED HIM. IN ROBERT'S MIND, IT WAS THE POINT OF NO RETURN. IT WAS NOW OR NEVER. [ GROANS ] DURING THE STRUGGLE, BOTH ROBERT AND GRACE'S FATHER FELL TO THE GROUND. AND, FOR WHATEVER REASON, ROBERT YELLED AT GRACE'S FATHER. - WHY DID YOU DO IT? - DO WHAT? WHAT DID I DO? WHY DID YOU MOLEST HER? FOR GOD'S SAKE, I NEVER MOLESTED HER. SHE'S LYING TO YOU. IS THAT TRUE? I LIED. I'M SO SORRY, ROBERT. [ SCREAMING ] Choung: EVERYTHING THAT HE THOUGHT WAS TRUE WAS NOT. Seifert: HIS WORLD MUST HAVE JUST COLLAPSED, BECAUSE HIS PROBLEM IS TRUSTING WOMEN. AND HE TRUSTED THIS WOMAN. AND HERE, SHE HAS DECEIVED HIM, AND LET HIM DOWN AGAIN. Woman: OH, MY GOD, ALAN! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? CALL 911. Narrator: ROBERT HAD BEEN TRAINED IN FIRST AID. HAVING JUST TRIED TO KILL ALAN DILLMAN, HE NOW DESPERATELY TRIES TO SAVE HIS LIFE WHILE GRACE'S MOTHER CALLS 911. OH, MY GOD. Choung: ROBERT ACTUALLY STARTED HELPING GRACE'S FATHER, TO TRY TO STOP THE BLEEDING. GRACE, STILL STANDING THERE IN THE ROOM. ALAN! OH, MY GOD. Narrator: WITHIN MINUTES, OFFICERS FROM THE GAHANNA POLICE DEPARTMENT RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY CALL. Choung: THE OFFICERS FOUND ROBERT EXTREMELY COMPLIANT. THEY ORDERED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM. THEY HANDCUFFED HIM, PLACED HIM IN CUSTODY, THEN WALKED HIM OUTSIDE TO WHERE HE WAS PLACED IN THE BACK OF THE CRUISER. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE INCIDENT, GRACE WAS JUST EMOTIONLESS WATCHING WAS HAPPENING. AN OFFICER ASKED HER VERY POIGNANTLY, "IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND?" TO WHICH SHE RESPONDED, "NO, NOT REALLY." OUR OFFICERS, BASED ON THE 911 CALL, KNEW THAT SHE WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED. SO, THEY ACTUALLY CALLED HER OUT ALSO. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO YOUR FATHER? LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU. WE MET ONLINE. Narrator: AT THE POLICE STATION, ROBERT COOPERATES WITH INVESTIGATORS. Choung: HE TOOK US STEP BY STEP, EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS PROTECT HER. HE WAS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH THAT HE KNEW HOW TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO US IN A CLEAR AND CONCISE MANNER. Narrator: BUT INTERVIEWING GRACE IS A DIFFERENT STORY. THERE WAS NO SIGNS OF FORCED ENTRY. Choung: SHE DENIED TO SPEAK WITH US. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT SHE MADE WHILE SHE WAS SITTING THERE IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM RAISED CONCERN. SHE WENT ON ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS THE WATER TASTED. IT JUST SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS SO DETACHED FROM THE MOMENT. HER REACTIONS WERE NOT NORMAL FOR SOMEBODY OF HER AGE FOLLOWING SUCH A CRITICAL INCIDENT. THIS WAS UNIQUE. IT CAUGHT EVERYBODY OFF GUARD. GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK WITH, GRACE. Narrator: WITH GRACE UNCOOPERATIVE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR POLICE TO VERIFY ROBERT'S VERSION OF EVENTS. ALL WE HAD WAS THIS STATEMENT MADE BY ROBERT. WE HAD A STABBING. WE HAD A KNIFE. WE HAD A VICTIM. WE HAD A SUSPECT. WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WAS MOTIVATION. Narrator: ROBERT BEST HAS ATTEMPTED TO MURDER THE FATHER OF HIS 16-YEAR-OLD ONLINE GIRLFRIEND GRACE DILLMAN. I LIED. BUT EVERYTHING FALLS APART WHEN GRACE ADMITS SHE'S BEEN LYING TO HIM ABOUT HER FATHER'S ABUSE. WE MET ONLINE. ROBERT IS IN CUSTODY, HELPING DETECTIVES WITH THEIR INVESTIGATION. BUT GRACE REMAINS UNCOOPERATIVE. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MOTIVATED THIS BRUTAL ATTACK, THE POLICE NEED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. THEY IMPOUND GRACE AND ROBERT'S COMPUTERS, AND BEGIN SEARCHING THROUGH THEIR MESSAGES. Choung: THE ONLINE ELEMENT FOR THIS INVESTIGATION WAS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT WE HAD. AS DETAILED AND AS WELL THOUGHT OUT THE PLAN WAS BETWEEN ROBERT AND GRACE, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FLAWED. IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE FOCUSING ON THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS... NOT LEAVING FOOTPRINTS, YOU KNOW? BASICALLY, THINGS THAT YOU'LL WATCH AND SEE ON TV. HOWEVER, THEIR BIGGEST FLAW WAS THEIR ONLINE CORRESPONDENCE. Narrator: AS POLICE CATALOGUED THE COUPLE'S E-MAILS, SERGEANT CHOUNG LEARNS HOW THE PLOT WAS HATCHED AND HOW DEEPLY ROBERT HAD FALLEN FOR GRACE. I STILL CARE ABOUT HER. I LOVE HER. MY FIRST REACTION WAS, "MY GOD, THIS GUY GOT DUPED." HE HAD FALLEN SO FAR IN LOVE WITH HER THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING. AND HE ALMOST DID. TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY MURDERING SOMEBODY IN THE NAME OF LOVE IS PRETTY PROFOUND. AND IT REALLY SEEMED LIKE GRACE WAS GROOMING ROBERT THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. Narrator: THE CORRESPONDENCE ALSO REVEALS ANOTHER DISTURBING ASPECT OF GRACE'S ONLINE ACTIVITY... THE CONSTANT USE OF A PSEUDONYM, ALEXANDRIA STEELE. Choung: THERE WERE TIMES WHEN ROBERT ACTUALLY REFERRED TO HER AS ALEX, AND SOMETIMES AS GRACE. IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE IT WAS NATURAL JUST TO USE THEM INTERCHANGEABLY. Narrator: ROBERT, MEANWHILE, WAS STILL USING HIS GAMING HANDLE, ELEMENTAL EVIL. Seifert: BEING ONLINE ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE A DIFFERENT PERSONA. AND THEN THESE TWO FANTASY PEOPLE FORM A RELATIONSHIP LIKE IN A VIDEO GAME, WHERE YOU CAN CREATE A WHOLE FANTASY UNIVERSE WHERE THESE PEOPLE MAKE UP THEIR OWN STORY. Narrator: AFTER READING THROUGH HER E-MAILS, SERGEANT CHOUNG BEGINS TO WONDER IF GRACE TOOK THIS VIRTUAL FANTASY TO ANOTHER LEVEL. Choung: FOR HER TO ADOPT ANOTHER NAME, I DON'T THINK IT WAS TO COVER HER TRACKS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I THINK SHE TRULY FELT THAT, THAT WAS HER NAME. Narrator: BUT WHATEVER PROBLEMS GRACE HAD ACCEPTING REALITY, THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT STILL ELUDES INVESTIGATORS. Choung: UNFORTUNATELY, WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH SHE FABRICATED THIS STORY WHERE SHE HAD BEEN MOLESTED, AT A VERY EARLY AGE BY HER FATHER, WHERE SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEATEN BY HER MOTHER. Narrator: IT'S THE PUZZLE AT THE HEART OF THE CASE, AND IT CONTINUES TO INTRIGUE PSYCHOLOGIST KATHRYN SEIFERT. Seifert: YOU REALLY CAN'T WALK UP AND KILL SOMEBODY THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOVE, UNLESS THERE'S A BREAK IN THAT ATTACHMENT. AND WHAT BREAKS ATTACHMENT IS ONE OF TWO THINGS... SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OR ABUSE AND NEGLECT EARLY IN CHILDHOOD. ROBERT, I BELIEVE, ALSO HAD SOME ATTACHMENT ISSUES BECAUSE THE ABANDONMENT BY MOTHER AND STEPMOTHER. THE INTERNET BECOMES THE PERFECT VEHICLE FOR TWO KIDS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO SAY, "I LOVE YOU FOREVER" IN A VERY UNREALISTIC WAY, AND, "I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU," BUT DO NOT HAVE THE EMPATHY THAT GOES ALONG WITH REAL RELATIONSHIPS. Woman: A FATHER STABBED IN HIS BED. Narrator: IN PART, THANKS TO ROBERT'S FIRST AID, ALAN DILLMAN SURVIVED THE ATTACK. AFTER PLEADING GUILTY, ROBERT RECEIVES AN EIGHT-YEAR SENTENCE FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER, ATTEMPTED AGGRAVATED MURDER, AND FELONIOUS ASSAULT. I GET THE WORD THAT MY SON IS GOING TO PRISON FOR ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO MURDER SOMEBODY. IT WAS A DEVASTATING BLOW TO THE WHOLE FAMILY. I WATCHED MY FATHER, THE STRONGEST MAN I KNOW... 6-FOOT-2, 250 POUNDS, LIKE A MOUNTAIN. AND COMPLETELY IN TEARS. Narrator: LEE BEST CALLS HIS SON IN PRISON EVERY WEEK. I DON'T ABSOLVE HIM OF ANYTHING HE DID. I MEAN, HE COMMITTED A CRIME. HE NEEDED TO BE PUNISHED. BUT THROUGH IT ALL, I STILL LOVE MY SON VERY MUCH. NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES, Bernice: AS FAR AS AN EDUCATION AND HIS LIFE IN THE FUTURE, IT'S GOING TO BE A HARD ROW TO HOE. AND I'M JUST HOPING THAT HE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT HIS FAMILY WILL BE THERE BEHIND HIM. Narrator: THE GIRL ROBERT WANTED TO PROTECT, GRACE DILLMAN, RECEIVES TWO YEARS PROBATION UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION AND AN EIGHT-YEAR SUSPENDED SENTENCE FROM THE JUVENILE COURT. NEITHER SHE NOR HER FAMILY WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DOCUMENTARY. GRACE'S MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS ARE CONFIDENTIAL, AND HER TRUE MOTIVATION FOR PLANNING TO MURDER HER PARENTS REMAINS UNKNOWN. I REALLY DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF AN OPINION ABOUT GRACE HERSELF. I DON'T KNOW THE GIRL. I'VE NEVER TALKED TO HER ON THE PHONE OR ANYTHING. BUT HE STILL HAS FEELINGS FOR HER. HE WROTE TO ME ONCE THAT, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN I GET OUT. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOOD FOR ONE ANOTHER, BUT I STILL LOVE HER."
