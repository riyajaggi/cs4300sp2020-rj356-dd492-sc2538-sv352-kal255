 AND LIES TO UNTANGLE. I LOOKED UP AND THEN IT WAS JUST GONE. WE STILL HAVE QUESTIONS WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO ANSWER. NATIVE NEW YORKER MICHELE REITER IS A 38-YEAR-OLD DIVORCED MOTHER OF TWO. MICHELE NOW LIVES AND WORKS IN BROWNWOOD, TEXAS, WHERE SHE'S POPULAR WITH BOTH THE HARDWARE STORE STAFF AND THE CUSTOMERS. SHE HAD A REALLY OUTGOING PERSONALITY. SHE WAS FUN TO BE AROUND. SHE COULD BE FLIRTATIOUS. REALLY? SHE WAS BUBBLY, ALWAYS IN A GOOD MOOD. COULDN'T REALLY GET HER DOWN.

 SHE WAS JUST CHEERFUL, HIGH-SPIRITED. SHE DEFINITELY STOOD OUT HERE. I LIKE YOUR ARM TATS. I LIKE YOURS, TOO. - THANK YOU. THERE YOU GO. - THANKS A LOT. THERE'S YOUR CHANGE. - THANK YOU. SEE YOU LATER. BYE. - SEE YA. MICHELE'S BEST FRIEND IS DENISE WORRELL. WHAT? YOU'RE SUCH A FLIRT. WHAT? NO WAY. - MY GOSH. YES, YOU ARE. HE HAD NICE TATS. I KNOW. THE FIRST NIGHT WE WORKED TOGETHER, IT WAS LIKE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE WERE JUST BEST FRIENDS AND IT JUST WENT FROM THERE. I WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING ANOTHER ONE, ACTUALLY. YOU SHOULD. - YEAH, I MEAN... I LOVE THIS ONE. YEAH. - THANK YOU. MICHELE TELLS DENISE HOW SHE'S JUST BROKEN UP WITH HER BOYFRIEND OF FOUR YEARS, AFTER DISCOVERING HE'D CHEATED ON HER. DENISE INVITES MICHELE TO BE HER HOUSEMATE. THE NICE THING ABOUT HER BEING ABLE TO MOVE IN WITH ME WAS SHE WASN'T COMPLETELY ON HER OWN, YET, AND SHE HAD SOMEBODY THAT WAS THERE FOR HER, YOU KNOW, SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO ADJUST TO BEING IN A QUIET HOME. AS MICHELE SETTLES INTO HER NEW HOME, HER TEENAGE KIDS, ALEXIS AND TY, MAKE REGULAR VISITS. LISTEN, PUT IT AWAY. WE'RE ALMOST READY. ALL RIGHT. - OKAY. MICHELE'S CHILDREN WERE HER LIFE. SHE LOVED HER CHILDREN BEYOND ANYTHING. WE HAD A FUN TIME. WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME. EVERY DAY, SHE WOULD MAKE ME MY FAVORITE MEAL, WHICH WAS SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS, AND THAT WAS AWESOME. NO! SHE WOULD COOK AND IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS COOKING A MEAL FOR 10 PEOPLE. SHE WOULD MAKE A LOT OF FOOD. LIKE, LEFT A FACE PRINT. COME ON, GUYS. AWW, IT'S OKAY. IS DAD HERE ALREADY? WOW, WE'RE NOT EVEN FINISHED. YEAH. OKAY, GUYS, COME ON. GET YOUR STUFF. MICHELE FEELS HER EX-HUSBAND, STEVE, ALWAYS ARRIVES TOO EARLY, CUTTING HER TIME WITH THE KIDS SHORT. BYE, MOM. - HEY, YOU GOT EVERYTHING? YOU GOT YOUR SWEATER, YOUR BOOKS? HEY, COME BACK. GIVE YOUR MOM A KISS. THEY LIVED WITH THEIR DAD 'CAUSE, WHEN HER AND STEVE DIVORCED, THEY LET THE CHILDREN DECIDE WHERE THEY WANTED TO LIVE AND, BECAUSE THEY HAD GROWN UP IN THAT AREA WHERE STEVE LIVED, THEY CHOSE TO STAY THERE. BYE, MOM. BYE, SWEETIE. WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE AND SHE WOULD LIKE HUG YOU, SHE WOULD KIND OF HOLD ON TIGHTER CAUSE SHE DIDN'T REALLY WANT YOU TO LEAVE AND SHE WANTED YOU TO STAY. BYE, MOM. - SEE YA. THE CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT WORKS FOR THE KIDS, BUT MICHELE FINDS IT HARD HAVING THEM AN HOUR'S DRIVE AWAY. SHE KNOWS STEVE STILL HASN'T FORGIVEN HER FOR LEAVING HIM, FOUR YEARS AGO, FOR ANOTHER MAN. WHEN IT CAME TO MICHELE WANTING TO SEE THE KIDS, I WAS ALL FOR IT 'CAUSE SHE'S STILL THEIR MOM. SHE WAS ALWAYS GONNA BE THEIR MOM, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US. WITH NO KIDS AT HOME, NO HUSBAND, AND, NOW, NO BOYFRIEND, THE VERY SOCIAL MICHELE IS LONELY. SHE GOES ON FACEBOOK TO LET PEOPLE KNOW SHE'S AVAILABLE. RIGHT AWAY, SHE GETS A FRIEND REQUEST, FROM A MAN NAMED ROCKY SWITZER. LIKE HER, HE'S A TEXAS TRANSPLANT AND NATIVE NEW YORKER. HEY. - HEY. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? MICHELE WAS IN HER BEDROOM AND SHE HAD HER YEARBOOKS ALL SPREAD ACROSS THE BED. THIS GUY FROM HIGH SCHOOL IS TRYING TO FRIEND ME ON FACEBOOK, BUT I CAN'T FIND HIM IN MY YEARBOOK. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY KEPT ALL THESE. WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR? HIS NAME IS ROCKY. ROCKY SWITZER. AND, APPARENTLY, HE WAS IN MY SISTER'S CLASS. THE FACT THAT HE KNEW MELANIE, HER SISTER, AND KNEW THE SCHOOL THEY HAD GONE TO AND NEW SOME THINGS ABOUT HER FAMILY, THAT MADE HER A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE. SHE WENT AHEAD AND ACCEPTED THE FRIEND REQUEST. WAS THAT YOU? MY GOD. GIVE ME THE BOOK. DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS SO EMBARRASSING. THAT WEEKEND, MICHELE AND ROCKY GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND FIND OUT THEY'VE GOT LOTS IN COMMON. FROM WHAT MICHELE WAS SAYING, THEY WERE MESSAGING BACK AND FORTH QUITE A BIT AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE FRIENDLY. MORNING. MORNING. ARE YOU STILL TALKING TO THAT GUY? YEP. SO, HE'S CUTE? NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. HE'S... HE'S NICE. NO, HE'S UGLY? YOU KNOW WHAT? I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE, OKAY? THERE'S NO PICTURE. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HE DOESN'T HAVE A PROFILE PICTURE? I DON'T KNOW. OKAY, I GOT TO GO. I JUST KIND OF LET IT GO AND THEN, I THINK LIKE THE NEXT DAY, HE HAD A PICTURE UP ON HIS PROFILE. HEY, DENISE. YEAH? I FINALLY GOT A PICTURE. YEAH? AND? HE'S KIND OF CUTE. MICHELE FINALLY SEES A PHOTO OF ROCKY. HE LOOKS GOOD, BUT SHE WONDERS WHO THE ATTRACTIVE BLONDE IS ON HIS ARM. IT SEEMED TO HER LIKE HE WAS MORE LEGITIMATE. THIS WAS A REAL PERSON. ON MONDAY MORNING, MICHELE GETS A MESSAGE. ROCKY IS TRAVELING TO NEARBY ABILENE, TEXAS. AFTER A WEEKEND OF MESSAGING, MICHELE IS EAGER TO MEET HIM IN PERSON. MICHELE IS EXCITED AND NERVOUS ABOUT HER DATE WITH ROCKY. SHE KNOWS IT'S ONE THING TO BE ATTRACTED TO SOMEONE ONLINE, BUT THE REAL TEST IS WHEN YOU MEET IN PERSON. WHEN I GOT HOME FROM WORK, MICHELE WAS THERE. HEY. - HEY. YOU LOOK NICE. - WELL, THANK YOU. SO, WHERE'S HE TAKING YOU? ROCKIN' R STEAKHOUSE, SANTA ANNA. FANCY. LISTEN, I WON'T BE LATE. OKAY. - OKAY. HAVE FUN. - SEE YA! IT WAS NICE TO SEE HER ENTHUSIASTIC AND I WAS HAPPY FOR HER. AS MIDNIGHT APPROACHES, DENISE CAN'T CONTAIN HER CURIOSITY ABOUT MICHELE'S BIG DATE. I SENT HER A TEXT AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, "HOW'S IT GOING?" ABOUT 12:30, I SENT HER ANOTHER TEXT AND I SAID, "ARE YOU OK?" AND I STILL DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING BACK. THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING IN ME THAT WENT, "THIS ISN'T QUITE RIGHT." LIKE I KEPT REACHING OVER AND LOOKING AT MY PHONE, YOU KNOW, WAITING FOR AN ANSWER. THERE'S THAT PART OF MY MIND THAT KEPT WANTING TO GRASP ON TO THAT, IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG, I WOULD KNOW, YOU KNOW? LIKE SHE WOULD'VE GOT A HOLD OF ME. BUT THERE WAS A BIGGER PART OF MY MIND THAT WAS SAYING "SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY NOT RIGHT HERE. SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY NOT RIGHT." BY 4:00 AM, MICHELE STILL ISN'T PICKING UP. Hey, it's Michele. Leave me a message. I GOT UP IN THE MORNING AND THE FIRST THING I DID WAS CALL HOME DEPOT, TO SEE IF SHE HAD COME TO WORK. HEY, THIS IS DENISE WORRELL. HAS MICHELE REITER SHOWN UP FOR WORK YET? NO. HAS SHE CALLED IN? OKAY, THANK YOU. I KNEW SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT AND I SAID, "OKAY, I'M CALLING THE COPS." YES, I NEED TO REPORT A MISSING PERSON. I SAID THAT SHE HAD GONE ON THIS DATE WITH THIS GUY THAT HAD FRIENDED HER ON FACEBOOK AND THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET IN SANTA ANNA AND GO TO DINNER AT THE STEAKHOUSE THERE. GUY'S NAME IS ROCKY SWITZER. I CAN SHOW YOU THE PROFILE. ONE SECOND. I REMEMBER SAYING, "YOU KNOW, I CAN SHOW YOU THE PROFILE." BUT AFTER DENISE ENTERS ROCKY'S NAME, NOTHING COMES UP. MICHELE HAS DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE AND, NOW, SO HAS HER NEW FACEBOOK FRIEND, ROCKY. I LOOKED AND I LOOKED AND I'M LIKE "HOW COULD THAT BE?" I KNOW I HAD SAW THAT PROFILE THERE. AND THEN IT WAS JUST GONE. IT WAS HERE. I KNOW IT WAS HERE. LAST NIGHT, SINGLE MOM MICHELE REITER WENT ON A DATE WITH A MAN SHE'D JUST MET ON FACEBOOK, ROCKY SWITZER. LISTEN, I WON'T BE LATE. - OKAY. BUT, NOW, NO ONE, INCLUDING HER HOUSEMATE, HAS HEARD FROM HER FOR 24 HOURS. YES, I NEED TO REPORT A MISSING PERSON. AT THE BROWNWOOD POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE CASE LANDS ON THE DESK OF DETECTIVE BRIAN TOMPKINS. TOMPKINS KNOWS FROM EXPERIENCE THAT MOST PEOPLE REPORTED MISSING AFTER A DATE GENERALLY TURN UP UNHARMED. HE HOPES THAT'LL BE THE CASE WITH MICHELE. WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED THE REPORT, WHAT CAUGHT MY EYE WAS THE NAME ROCKY SWITZER, 'CAUSE THAT WAS THE LAST PERSON THAT FRIENDS AND FAMILY KNEW MICHELE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH WHEN SHE WENT MISSING. DETECTIVE TOMPKINS CALLS MICHELE'S SISTER, MELANIE, TO SEE WHAT SHE CAN TELL HIM ABOUT ROCKY. MELANIE RIVERA? IT'S DETECTIVE TOMPKINS, BROWNWOOD PD. BUT MELANIE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYONE NAMED ROCKY FROM HIGH SCHOOL. NEXT, BRIAN CALLS DALLAS/FORT WORTH AIRPORT. YES, I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT AN EMPLOYEE, ROCKY SWITZER. SURELY, ROCKY'S COLLEAGUES CAN GIVE HIM SOME INFORMATION. NO ONE? BUT NO ONE BY THAT NAME WORKS AT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, OR ANYWHERE AT THE AIRPORT. FACED WITH TWO DEAD ENDS, ALREADY, DETECTIVE TOMPKINS STARTS TO WORRY AND DRIVES 30 MINUTES TO SANTA ANNA. HE'S HEADED TO THE SITE OF MICHELE AND ROCKY'S FIRST DATE, THE ROCKIN' R STEAKHOUSE. MA'AM, DETECTIVE TOMPKINS, BROWNWOOD PD. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME, WAS THIS WOMAN IN HERE LAST NIGHT WITH ANYONE? THE BAD NEWS KEEPS COMING. ON THE NIGHT MICHELE DISAPPEARED, THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED. THANK YOU, MA'AM. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT EVERYTHING ROCKY SWITZER TOLD MICHELE IS A LIE. I HAD EXHAUSTED ALL MEANS OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHO ROCKY WAS AND WAS STARTIN' TO BELIEVE THAT HE POSSIBLY DID NOT EXIST. WITH NOTHING TO GO ON, THE DETECTIVE PUTS OUT AN APPEAL ON THE LOCAL NEWS, ASKING ANYONE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT MICHELE'S WHEREABOUTS TO COME FORWARD. MICHELE REITER. - HEY, HEY, HEY, IT'S ON. FOR MICHELE'S KIDS, TY AND ALEXIS, THEIR MOTHER'S DISAPPEARANCE MAKES NO SENSE. HER ROOMMATE REPORTED HER MISSING... AT FIRST, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT, 'CAUSE, COULDN'T BE LIKE GONE. SHE WAS ALWAYS THERE. 'CAUSE LIKE EVERY NIGHT, SHE WOULD EITHER CALL US OR TEXT US, JUST TO KNOW THAT SHE'S OKAY AND SHE MISSES US AND SHE LOVES US. WITH AN OLD HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATE. AND THEN, I WATCHED THE NEWS AND THEY SAID THAT SHE WAS MISSING. I WAS LIKE" THIS IS REAL." I HAD HEARD THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE SAYING THAT SHE RAN AWAY AND I KNEW THAT WASN'T TRUE. MY MOM'S NOT THAT KIND OF PERSON. JUST LEAVING ISN'T LIKE HER. TOMPKINS DECIDES IT'S TIME TO TALK TO MICHELE'S EX-HUSBAND, STEVE. HE HEARD THE MARRIAGE ENDED BADLY AND THAT STEVE IS STILL FUMING ABOUT IT. DIVORCE JUST WASN'T ANYTHING THAT I EVER WANTED. YOU KNOW, YOU GET MARRIED, YOU WANT TO STAY MARRIED, BUT IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT THAT WAY. THAT'S WHEN THE ANGER KIND OF SET IN. STEVEN REITER? BRIAN WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT STEVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS EX-WIFE. WELL. WE HAD OUR PROBLEMS, BUT, WE WERE WORKING THEM OUT. DID YOU SEE OR TALK TO HER ON THE 10th? YEAH. WE TALKED ON THE PHONE. WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT ON THE 10th? WELL, SHE SPLIT UP WITH THAT LANNY. SHE WAS TAKING THAT PRETTY HARD. LANNY? LANNY BUSH. STEVE SAYS THAT, AFTER LEAVING HIM, MICHELE MOVED IN WITH A MAN NAMED LANNY. DETECTIVE TOMPKINS JOTS DOWN THE NAME AND WONDERS "DOES MICHELE HAVE MORE THAN ONE ANGRY EX?" DOES THE NAME ROCKY SWITZER MEAN ANYTHING? NO. NO, CAN'T SAY AS I KNOW THAT NAME. OKAY, THANKS. I'LL BE IN TOUCH. DETECTIVE TOMPKINS TRIES TO CALL MICHELE'S EX-BOYFRIEND LANNY BUSH. LANNY WAS LIVING IN SAN ANGELO, TEXAS, AT THE TIME, WITH HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND. Hello. - LANNY BUSH? YES, SIR. - This is Detective Tompkins, Brownwood PD. LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. SURE. LANNY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT HIM AND MICHELE HAD HAD A PRETTY ROUGH BREAKUP, BUT THEY WERE NOW ON CIVIL TERMS. DOES THE NAME ROCKY SWITZER MEAN ANYTHING? No, that don't ring a bell. SHE WAS SEEIN' THIS MARRIED FELLA, BUT, I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME OR ANYTHING. TOMPKINS SPECULATES WHETHER THE MARRIED MAN MICHELE GOT INVOLVED WITH AFTER HER BREAKUP WITH LANNY MIGHT BE ROCKY SWITZER. THEN, SUDDENLY, BACK IN MICHELE'S NEIGHBORHOOD IN BROWNWOOD, TEXAS, THERE'S A BREAKTHROUGH. MICHELE'S CAR IS DISCOVERED, ABANDONED, AT A SPORTS COMPLEX JUST 10 MINUTES FROM HER HOME. I DID NOT SEE ANY SIGNS OF STRUGGLE AROUND THE CAR. ALL THE DOORS WERE LOCKED, EXCEPT THE DRIVER'S-SIDE DOOR. MICHELE'S PURSE AND I.D. ARE ON THE FRONT SEAT. TOMPKINS CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WOULD MAKE HER LEAVE THEM BEHIND. THE MISSING-PERSON'S CASE JUST GOT CRITICAL. MICHELE HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 48 HOURS AND DETECTIVE TOMPKINS IS NO CLOSER TO FIGURING OUT WHERE SHE IS OR THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON SHE'S WITH. AT THE HARDWARE STORE WHERE MICHELE WORKS, DETECTIVE TOMPKINS MEETS YOLANDA, MICHELE'S COWORKER AND CLOSE FRIEND, TO SEE WHAT SHE CAN TELL HIM ABOUT MICHELE'S LOVE LIFE. SHE REVEALS A TANGLED WEB OF MEN. FIRST, STEVE; THEN, LANNY; AND THEN... SHE WAS SEEING THIS ONE GUY. DO YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS, HIS NAME? UM, KEMPER. KEMPER CROFT. YOLANDA TELLS TOMPKINS THAT KEMPER HAD COME INTO THE STORE SIX WEEKS AGO. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL. - WHAT'S THAT? I'LL TAKE ONE OF THESE. YOU TAKE ONE OF THESE. HE CHARMED MICHELE. AND, WHEN HE TOLD HER HE WAS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE, SHE WAS GLAD TO HEAR IT. BUT IT WASN'T THE TRUTH. WE SPOKE ABOUT KEMPER'S WIFE CALLIN' HER AND ACCUSIN' HER OF HAVIN' AN AFFAIR WITH HER HUSBAND. SHE'D LOST HER MIND. SHE FREAKED OUT ON MICHELE OVER THE PHONE. Michele? SPEAKING. I know what you and Kemper have been up to. WAIT, WHAT? Don't even try to deny it. - WHO IS THIS? I'm not messing with you! Stay away from my husband. SHOCKED AND HURT, MICHELE IMMEDIATELY BREAKS THINGS OFF WITH KEMPER. SHE JUST PRETTY MUCH SAID THAT SHE WAS DONE WITH IT. SHE DIDN'T WANT ANY KIND OF DRAMA IN HER LIFE AND SHE DIDN'T NEED IT. TOMPKINS DECIDES TO BRING IN MICHELE'S MARRIED EX-BOYFRIEND KEMPER FOR QUESTIONING. YOU KNEW MICHELE REITER? I DID, YEAH. HOW DID YOU AND MICHELE MEET? WE MET AT THE HARDWARE STORE SHE WAS SERVIN' AT. WE STARTED FLIRTIN', GOT ALONG REALLY WELL, AND SHE GAVE ME HER NUMBER AND... WE WENT OUT A COUPLE TIMES. AND THINGS GOT A LITTLE PHYSICAL. WHO'S ROCKY SWITZER? SIR, I DON'T KNOW. NEVER HEARD THAT NAME, SIR. OKAY. WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE MICHELE? THINK IT WAS ON THE 8th. YOU DIDN'T SEE HER OR TALK TO HER ON THE 10th? NO. I DID TALK TO HER ON THE 10th. KEMPER TOLD ME THAT HE DID MAKE CONTACT WITH HER ON THE PHONE ON THE 10th OF SEPTEMBER, IN REGARDS TO HAVING TO QUIT TALKIN' TO HER BECAUSE HIS WIFE, SUSAN, HAD FOUND OUT ABOUT THE AFFAIR. HOW DID SHE FIND OUT ABOUT THE AFFAIR? I DO NOT KNOW, SIR. SHE WAS MAD AS HELL, THOUGH. KEMPER SWEARS THAT HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MICHELE'S DISAPPEARANCE. AND THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES HIM. MEANWHILE, MICHELE'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR WORD ON HER WHEREABOUTS. IT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS SINCE MICHELE LEFT FOR HER DATE WITH ROCKY SWITZER. THEN, MICHELE'S HOUSEMATE, DENISE, HEARS HER PHONE PING. THERE'S A MESSAGE. MOTHER OF TWO MICHELE REITER HAS BEEN MISSING FOR FOUR DAYS. DETECTIVE BRIAN TOMPKINS IS NO CLOSER TO FINDING OUT WHERE SHE IS AND WORRIES TROUBLE MAY HAVE BEFALLEN HER. BUT, THEN, HER BEST FRIEND, DENISE, GETS A TEXT MESSAGE. THAT FIRST SECOND WHEN I OPENED THE TEXT AND IT SAID IT WAS FROM MICHELE, JUST RELIEF CAME OVER ME. FINALLY, SHE HAD GOTTEN A HOLD OF US. THE MESSAGE SAYS, "I'M FINE BUT I CAN NEVER COME BACK, NOT NOW. JUST LET IT ALONE." DENISE READS THE MESSAGE AGAIN AND SEES IT CAME FROM MICHELE'S AOL ACCOUNT. IF MICHELE WAS TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF ME, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT THROUGH AOL. I CALLED STEVE. STEVE? IT'S DENISE. I'M SORRY TO WAKE YOU. DID YOU GET A MESSAGE FROM MICHELE? HE HADN'T RECEIVED A MESSAGE. THEN I KNEW, FOR SURE, IT WASN'T FROM HER. IF MICHELE HAD SENT THAT MESSAGE, SHE WOULD'VE SENT ONE TO STEVE. SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT HER CHILDREN AND NOT SAID SOMETHING. I KNEW IT WASN'T HER AND IT WAS LIKE TAKIN' THAT RELIEF AND THROWING IT OFF A CLIFF. MICHELE'S FRIENDS NOW FEAR THE WORST AND DOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS TO HELP FIND HER. WE JUST TRIED TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING THAT WE COULD THINK OF, YOU KNOW. WE STARTED POSTING PICTURES DOWNTOWN, AT THE CONVENIENCE STORES, ANYWHERE THAT WE COULD THINK OF. THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE, HER FRIENDS CATCH A BREAK WHEN ROCKY SWITZER SUDDENLY REAPPEARS ON FACEBOOK. AND SO, THERE I WAS ON FACEBOOK AND, BOOM, THERE HE WAS. ROCKY'S NAME WAS THERE AND I WAS LIKE "HE'S LOGGED ON. HE'S THERE. I NEED TO CALL SOMEBODY." HELLO. DENISE? IT'S BACK. ROCKY'S PROFILE IS BACK UP. OKAY, THANK YOU. Detective Tompkins. DETECTIVE, THE PROFILE IS BACK UP. GOT IT. THANKS. WHEN DENISE CONTACTED ME AND TOLD ME THAT ROCKY'S FACEBOOK PROFILE WAS ACTIVE AGAIN, I MADE CONTACT WITH FACEBOOK. YES, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE ABOUT AN ACCOUNT PRESERVATION ORDER. DETECTIVE TOMPKINS CALLS FACEBOOK AND ASKS THEM TO FREEZE THE ACCOUNT. HE THEN GETS A COURT ORDER TO OBTAIN THE SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION AND IP ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH ROCKY SWITZER. I'M COMIN' FOR YOU, ROCKY. WHEN TOMPKINS GETS ACCESS TO ROCKY'S FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, HE READS THROUGH ROCKY'S MESSAGES AND SEES THAT MICHELE TOLD ROCKY ABOUT HER MARRIED BOYFRIEND. HE BELIEVES THAT THE ROCKY PROFILE PAGE COULD BE A FAKE, CREATED BY THE WIFE OF MICHELE'S EX-BOYFRIEND. DID YOU MAKE A PHONE CALL TO MICHELE REITER ON THE 10th, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S AFFAIR? YES, I DID. HELLO? STAY AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND, YOU BITCH! OR YOU'LL BE SORRY. SUSAN WAS HIGHLY UPSET AT THE FACT THAT KEMPER WAS HAVIN' AN AFFAIR WITH MICHELE. AND HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE AFFAIR? WHAT SUSAN TELLS HIM IS A SHOCKER. I WASN'T EXPECTING KEMPER HOME FROM WORK, YET. THERE WAS A MAN, STANDING THERE, THAT I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE. I OPENED UP THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT. YES? AND HE SAYS TO ME, "HELLO, MA'AM. YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR YOU. YOUR HUSBAND HAS BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH ANOTHER WOMAN BEHIND YOUR BACK." I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING. WHO IS SHE? HE TELLS ME HER NAME IS MICHELE. SO, I CALLED HER AND I TOLD HER TO STAY AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND. THIS MAN WHO CAME TO YOUR DOOR, HE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO TELL YA HIS NAME, DID HE? YES, HE DID. WHO ARE YOU? LANNY. LANNY BUSH, MA'AM. LANNY BUSH IS NONE OTHER THAN THE BOYFRIEND MICHELE LEFT AFTER FOUR YEARS OF DATING. DETECTIVE TOMPKINS REALIZES HE NEEDS TO FOLLOW UP HIS BRIEF CHAT WITH LANNY FOUR DAYS AGO. LANNY BUSH HAD TOLD ME THAT HE WAS NOT IN BROWNWOOD DURING THE DAY MICHELE WENT MISSING. SUSAN AND KEMPER CROFT RESIDE IN THE CITY LIMITS OF BROWNWOOD AND THEIR INTERVIEWS VERIFY THAT LANNY WAS IN TOWN AND WAS LYING. DENISE? - YES. BRIAN TOMPKINS. - YES. BUT FIRST, TOMPKINS NEEDS DENISE TO FILL HIM IN ON MICHELE AND LANNY'S HISTORY. HE WAS CONTROLLING. HE WAS OBSESSIVE. HE WAS ALWAYS CALLING HER WHEN SHE WAS OUT WITH HER FRIENDS AND CHECKING UP ON HER. HE... DROVE HER NUTS. LANNY TOLD ME THAT HE AND MICHELE WERE ON GOOD TERMS AGAIN, THAT THEY WERE TALKING REGULARLY AND GETTIN' ALONG JUST FINE. IS THAT TRUE? - GOD, NO. HE HAS BEEN CALLING HER AND HARASSING HER EVER SINCE. RIGHT THEN, I STARTED THINKIN' THAT LANNY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. SOMEHOW, LANNY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. WITH STRONG ALIBIS FOR HIS OTHER PERSONS OF INTEREST, IT'S CLEAR TOMPKINS SHOULD FOCUS SOLELY ON LANNY BUSH. BUT HE ALSO NEEDS TO FIND MICHELE, AND FAST. HE KNOWS HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. HE NEEDS MORE RESOURCES, MORE MANPOWER, AND MORE REACH, SO HE CALLS IN THE TEXAS RANGERS TO TAKE OVER THE CASE. YEAH, PUT ME THROUGH TO RANGER CRAWFORD. THE FIRST THING I DID, BECOMING INVOLVED WITH THE INVESTIGATION, WAS ASK TO SEE CELLPHONE RECORDS. THESE ARE ALL OF THEM? YEAH, THAT'S ALL OF THEM. THAT'S IT. RANGER CRAWFORD TRACKS MICHELE'S CELLPHONE. IT'S THE BEST CHANCE THEY HAVE OF FINDING HER. NORTH 45.25.89. WE WERE ABLE TO TRIANGULATE SOME GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS. MICHELE HAD LEFT BROWNWOOD, TRAVELING SOUTH; HAD TURNED WEST, THROUGH BROOKESMITH, TEXAS; AND TRAVELED SOME RURAL ROADWAYS INTO COLEMAN COUNTY. MICHELE'S PHONE DISAPPEARED FROM THE NETWORK THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER THE 10th. AND THAT'S THE LAST ONE, AT 8:55 PM. WHERE IS IT? THE LOCATION OF MICHELE'S LAST CELL PING IS REMOTE. THEN, LANNY BUSH REACHES OUT TO DETECTIVE TOMPKINS OF THE BROWNWOOD POLICE DEPARTMENT, WITH A STUNNING REVELATION. SO? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME? I'M ROCKY SWITZER. MICHELE REITER HAS BEEN MISSING SINCE SHE LEFT FOR A DATE WITH A NEW FACEBOOK FRIEND OVER A WEEK AGO. AS THE TEXAS RANGERS LAUNCH A RESCUE OPERATION, DETECTIVE BRIAN TOMPKINS SITS DOWN WITH THE MAN WHO IS BEHIND MICHELE'S FACEBOOK FLIRTATION. I'M ROCKY SWITZER. IS THAT RIGHT? LOOK, I KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS AND I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THAT WAY. I CREATED ROCKY TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO HER. I... I LOVED HER. I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER. I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. I MEAN, REALLY, IT WAS. SHE TREATED ME LIKE NO ONE'S EVER TREATED ME BEFORE. SO, YOU DID MEET WITH HER THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED? NO. NO, SIR. NO WAY. NO, I SET THE MEETIN' UP, BUT I DIDN'T SHOW UP. LOOK, I... I KNOW IT WAS STUPID AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, BUT, I WANTED HER TO FEEL WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE STOOD UP AND DUMPED, LIKE SHE DID TO ME. SO, WHY'D YOU TAKE SO LONG TO COME FORWARD? I FIGURED MICHELE HAD JUST PROBABLY RUN OFF TO TEACH ME A LESSON, AND I STILL THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. BUT, JUST IN CASE, THOUGHT I'D BETTER LET YOU KNOW, SO YOU DON'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME CHASIN' AROUND AFTER ROCKY SWITZER. OKAY. I'LL HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS, SO DON'T GO LEAVIN' TOWN. NO PROBLEM. LANNY WAS NOT ARRESTED AT THIS TIME, BUT I ALSO FELT THAT HE WASN'T BEING TRUTHFUL WITH ALL THE INFORMATION. TEXAS RANGER DANNY CRAWFORD TRIGGERS A GROUND SEARCH FOR MICHELE AT HER LAST-KNOWN PHONE LOCATION. WE WERE LOOKIN' A HALF A MILE TO EITHER SIDE OF THE ROADWAY, SO 1 MILE WIDE AND ABOUT 3 MILES LONG. THE TERRAIN GOES FROM CULTIVATED FIELDS, CROPLAND, TO PASTURELAND, SOME OF IT DENSE BRUSH, CEDAR, MESQUITE, OAK TREES. IT'S A DAUNTING TASK. BEFORE STARTING IN EARNEST... WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND HER. RANGER CRAWFORD HAS SOME QUESTIONS FOR LANNY BUSH. THANKS FOR COMING IN, LANNY. GLAD TO HELP. THEY STARTED OFF WITH, "WE'RE JUST HERE TO TRY TO, YOU KNOW, FIND OUT WHAT'S GOIN' ON, WHERE SHE'S AT," THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SEPTEMBER 10th. - YOU IN TOWN SEPTEMBER 10th? - NOPE. LANNY BEGAN BY JUST DENYING HE WAS EVEN IN BROWNWOOD, 'TIL, FINALLY, I QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT HIS MEETING WITH SUSAN CROFT. YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WOMAN? SUSAN CROFT SAID THAT LANNY BUSH HAD BEEN AT HER HOUSE ON THAT DAY. WELL, MAYBE I WAS IN TOWN FOR A WHILE. BUT HE CONTINUES TO DENY SEEING MICHELE ON THAT DAY. AND THIS GOES ON 'TIL I SHOWED HIM, BY PHONE RECORDS, THAT I COULD PUT HE AND MICHELE TOGETHER. WELL, MAYBE I SAW HER FOR A LITTLE WHILE. IN FACT, YEAH, WE MET UP IN THE NORTH PART OF BROWNWOOD, THE WAREHOUSE IN THE NORTH END OF TOWN, SO I COULD GIVE HER BACK SOME OF HER STUFF. BUT I SWEAR THAT'S WHERE I LEFT HER. RANGER CRAWFORD SHOWS LANNY THE MAP TRACKING BOTH PHONES. AND THESE ARE YOUR RECORDS. THE TWO PHONES TRAVELED TOGETHER THROUGH SOUTHERN BROWN COUNTY, INTO COLEMAN COUNTY AND THEY REMAINED TOGETHER UNTIL MICHELE'S PHONE DISAPPEARS FROM THE GRID. THE PHONES ARE TOGETHER FOR TWO HOURS, IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, BEFORE LANNY'S PHONE TRAVELS TO SAN ANGELO, ALONE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE. SHE'S. AT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. I TOLD HIM, I SAID, "LOOK, I DID NOT KILL MICHELE REITER. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER DISAPPEARANCE." JUST TELL US WHERE MICHELE IS. I CAN'T HELP YOU, DANNY. THEY HAD ONE INTENTION, AND ONE INTENTION ONLY, AND THAT WAS TO GET ME TO EITHER CONFESS OR INCRIMINATE MYSELF. ALL RIGHT, I'M DONE TALKIN' TO YOU. HE GOT MAD, TERMINATED THE INTERVIEW. RANGER CRAWFORD GETS A WARRANT TO SEARCH LANNY'S TRUCK. IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT, THEY FIND A RECEIPT FROM A GUN SHOP. NICK, COME AROUND HERE. FOR 3:13 PM, SEPTEMBER 10th. WE WERE ABLE TO RETRIEVE VIDEO OF LANNY IN THERE ON SEPTEMBER THE 10th, THE DAY MICHELE DISAPPEARED AND LANNY BOUGHT A BOX OF AMMO. THE AMMUNITION MATCHES THE CALIBER OF A GUN THAT LANNY'S MOTHER REPORTED MISSING JUST WEEKS BEFORE MICHELE VANISHED. IN THE BED OF THE PICKUP, WE FOUND A SHOVEL WITH THE HANDLE BROKEN OFF ON IT. THE SHOVEL HEAD WAS ACTUALLY VERY RUSTED, EXCEPT FOR ABOUT THE BOTTOM 3 OR 4 INCHES OF IT, WHICH SHOWED RECENT SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN USED TO DO SOME DIGGIN'. BUT RANGER CRAWFORD KNOWS HE CAN'T ARREST LANNY WITHOUT HARD EVIDENCE. THE ONLY HOPE WE HAVE OF MAKING A CASE IS TO FIND MICHELE'S REMAINS. THE TEXAS RANGERS MUSTER ALL THEIR RESOURCES FOR ONE FINAL SEARCH. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 100 OFFICERS. WE HAD TWO DOG TEAMS OUT, USING CADAVER DOGS. WE HAD MOUNTED HORSEBACK RIDERS. WE HAD OFFICERS ON ATVs AND THEN, WE ALSO JUST LINED TEAMS OF OFFICERS UP, ABOUT AN ARM'S LENGTH APART. THEY ALL KNOW THAT FINDING A BODY OUT HERE WILL BE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE. THIS PARTICULAR AREA HAS A HEAVY POPULATION OF FERAL HOGS AND FERAL HOGS ARE CARNIVOROUS. BASICALLY, ANYTHING THAT DIES GETS EATEN BY THE HOGS. WE WALKED THROUGH THE BRUSH AND SEARCHED FOR ANY POSSIBLE EVIDENCE THAT COULD TELL US WHERE MICHELE WAS. MY SEARCH TEAM HAD MADE IT TO THE LAST SOUTHERN AREA OF OUR SEARCH ZONE, WHICH WAS THE SECOND BRIDGE OFF... 26. HEY! OVER HERE! THINK I SAW SOMETHING! IT WAS A DIRT MOUND APPROXIMATELY 1 OR 2 FEET HIGH THAT HAD BRUSH THROWN ON TOP OF IT. YOU THINK THIS IS IT? WHEN YOU GOT ON THE DOWNWIND SIDE, YOU COULD SMELL THE ODOR OF DECOMPOSITION. YEAH, I DO. CALL IT IN. GET A SHOT OF THIS. IT'S HER. FINDING MICHELE'S BODY, YOU HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS. ONE, OKAY, WE CAN LET THE FAMILY KNOW WHERE SHE IS, YOU KNOW? IT'S A LETDOWN BECAUSE SHE'S NOT SAFE. HER FAMILY'S GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. BUT, THE ALTERNATIVE TO THAT IS THE UNKNOWN, NEVER FINDING HER, NEVER KNOWING, FOR SURE, WHAT HAPPENED. THE POLICE FORMALLY IDENTIFY MICHELE REITER'S BODY AND NOTIFY HER FAMILY. HELLO. THANKS FOR CALLING. YOUR WORST FEARS, THEY'RE NOW A REALITY. IT WAS JUST... IT WAS JUST TOO UNBELIEVABLE TO BELIEVE, THAT SHE COULD BE GONE. IT WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE A BLUR. LIKE IT JUST HIT YOU, AT ONCE, THAT YOU WOULDN'T SEE YOUR MOM AGAIN. I WAS IN SHOCK. YOU CAN'T PREPARE YOURSELF FOR A SITUATION LIKE THAT. THERE'S NO PREPARATION. WALKED IN THE HOUSE. THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME. AND I WAS DEVASTATED AND I KNEW SHE'D NEVER COME HOME. 2 WEEKS AFTER SHE DISAPPEARED, THE TEXAS RANGERS HAVE FINALLY FOUND MICHELE REITER'S BODY AND RANGER CRAWFORD HOPES TO PROVE THAT EX-BOYFRIEND LANNY BUSH IS HER KILLER. UNFORTUNATELY, IN THIS DEAL, DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND THE WEATHER CONDITIONS, THERE WAS NO DNA EVIDENCE RECOVERED. NOTHING. THERE WAS NO BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA. MICHELE HADN'T BEEN SHOT, SHE HADN'T BEEN STABBED, SHE HADN'T BEEN BEAT TO DEATH. STILL, LANNY BUSH IS CHARGED WITH MICHELE'S MURDER. THERE'S NO DNA. THERE'S NO FINGERPRINTS. THERE'S NO WITNESSES. THERE'S NO MURDER WEAPON. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHE DIED. WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR TRIAL, WITH A GUILTY VERDICT, LANNY DOES LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. OF COURSE, NOT GUILTY, HE WALKS. AT THE TIME, MY OFFICE BECAME INVOLVED AND DECIDED TO TAKE THIS CASE TO A GRAND JURY, IT WAS PURELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL. WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW THAT WAS GONNA PLAY IN FRONT OF A JURY. THE PROSECUTION PRESENTS THEIR THEORY THAT AN INNOCENT SINGLE MOTHER GOT FOOLED BY A MAN SHE ONCE TRUSTED. I BELIEVE ROCKY SWITZER HAD DONE AN EFFECTIVE-ENOUGH JOB AT TRICKING MICHELE THAT SHE WENT FOR A MEETING. SHE WENT TO GO MEET ROCKY SWITZER AND GO ON A DATE AND SHE NEVER SAW LANNY BUSH COMIN', UNTIL HE STUCK THAT PISTOL IN HER FACE. HEY, MICHELE. WHO YOU WAITIN' FOR? LANNY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! LANNY. LANNY. LANNY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - TURN AROUND. LANNY! - SHH SHH SHH SHH. LANNY, COME ON. LANNY. - IN THE TRUCK. I BELIEVE HE THEN FORCED HER IN HIS VEHICLE, DROVE TO SOUTHERN COLEMAN COUNTY... TO A SECLUDED LOCATION UNDER A BRIDGE. LANNY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? LANNY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THIS IS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE, LANNY. PLEASE. LANNY. DON'T, LANNY, PLEASE. LANNY, NO! LANNY, NO. HE PROBABLY STRANGLED HER OR USED SOME CHEMICAL MEANS TO MAKE HER UNCONSCIOUS, KILLED HER, AND, LATER, BURIED HER BODY UNDER THAT BRIDGE. HE THEN GATHERED HIS THINGS AND DROVE BACK TO SAN ANGELO. A SEARCH OF LANNY'S LAPTOP REVEALS THAT HE WAS GOOGLING KNOCKOUT DROPS THE DAY BEFORE MICHELE WENT MISSING. TRACES OF FREON ARE FOUND IN HIS TRUCK. BUT IT IS LANNY'S FINAL ACT THAT CONVINCES THE JURY OF HIS GUILT. THE NEXT MORNING, HE REALIZED HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE. HE LEFT MICHELE'S CELLPHONE THERE AT THE SCENE AND HE TRAVELED BACK AND RETRIEVED HER CELLPHONE. LANNY DIGS UP MICHELE'S PHONE AND CHECKS HER MESSAGES. THIS CREATES ONE FINAL PING THAT PLACES HIM BESIDE HER. ONLY, NOW, SHE'S DEAD. ON APRIL 11, 2014, LANNY BUSH IS FOUND GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER. HE IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. YOU KIND OF JUST HATE HIM. YOU WONDER WHY. WHY WAS IT SO NEEDY TO TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE? TO... DESTROY SOMEONE'S WHOLE, ENTIRE LIFE? FOR TWO WEEKS, ALL I WANTED WAS TO BE ABLE TO BRING MICHELE HOME FOR THEM. AND I WASN'T GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I FEEL LIKE, IF I COULD GO BACK AND SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT WITH MY MOTHER, I WOULD'VE. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
