Kept me in the pool for over an hour. I am still suffering s - side effects. A coyote during the day? These things have no fear of people. They're insane.

I wish it was,but it's not. I used to think,what if I had believed him. What if I hadn't walked away? Would he be here now? We would have come through this together. We would have won. {6}jennifer conover ex-wife of charlie crews But I didn't believe him, and I've learned it's better not to think that way.

So why won't stylman i.d. Manny? You think it was a set-up? Stylman arranged to have his wife killed,hired big boy,and made it look like a carjacking. So faing to i.d. The shooter is part of the quid pro quo. Quid pro quo. Stop it. Stop wha why won't you i.d. The shooter? You know what it looks like? It looks like you hired manny to kill your wife, but then make it look like a carjacking. Is this how u treat all your victims?

I hate to bother you, but it sounds like we have a wholpack of them out there now. That's where they belong. Well,I can'sleep. They're taunting me,charlie. Do you know that native americans considered coyotes to be trickste,scavengers,thieves,shape-shifter they're survivors. And you know what's amazing? Coyotes are the only indigenous north american animals to have proliferated since the europeans settled here. They're used to being subordinate to bears and wolves, but since we've eliminated those top predators,they've actually excelled. You're not making me feel any better. I want you to feel better. Should I call animal control? They're not gonna do anything about creatures living in the hills. Creatures? Ted. Ted. Domestic dogs have killed hundreds of people. Nobody's ever been killed by a coyote. Yet. {6}jennifer conover ex-wife charlie crews After the divorce from charlie,you remarried? Three years after. Yes.

How are the kids? You don't care about my kids. They could have been our kids. What do you want,charlie? I want to the un-wobbling pivot at the center of an ever-revolving universe. I want to be still. What do you want here,charlie? I want to know where she is. Leave her alone,charlie. Where she? This is the first time you've seen me in 12 years, and that's all you want to say?

Help! - I didn't touch you  - that crazy cop! He pulled a knife on me bef-- Tell me you're not buying this. About you hurting him? Of course not. About you pulling a knife? Will all due resct,lieutenant,the suspect is full of crap. Are you saying dettive crews did not pull a knife on manny umaga? He did not. That's not true. She's lying. She's lying protect me,because that's what partners do, and we're partners now. But don't do that for me. You pulled a knife on a suspect? He pulled one firs bring the husband backown here. - Ma'am,I'd like to--  - You're both cking up your partner. I get it. I also get we have an unsolved homicide. Cut umaga loose before we get hit with a lawsuit. But just make sure you have enough to go all the way around the other side of the pool,okay? Yes,sir. Thanks. Hey. What do you think? A fee? I got a faastic deal-- $12 a foot. Now coyotes can jump,but I figure eight feet ought to be enough. A fence? Yeah. Hey,guys,uh... Take it down. Manny says stylman did it. Stylman says manny wasn't even in the car. Manny is a career criminal,and stylman-- Is a good family man. Or at least he was. Up until three days ago,stylman was a good husband,a good father. What happened in that car that he won't tell us? That he can't tell us? We have to use his own strength against him. His strength? What's his strength? His weakness. His weakness is his strength? Exactly. It's lik the one-handed clap. Are you really zen? I'm zen-ish. You want in on this? My mother-in-law is taking my kids with her after e funeral. Taking them where? Back to fresno to live with her. You're giving your kids away? They'll be better off. That should work out pretty well. What do you mean? Well,peter,you're gonna need someone to take care of them. We've come her to arrest you. We have a witness who saw you shoot your wife. I didn't shoot her. I tried to save her. The man in the car shot her. You fought for her? Yes. But you won't fight for your kids? I fought for her. You fought that monster manny, but you can't be there for your kids? Why are you giving them away? I fought for her. What are you ashamed of? - You push me. - Did i? Crews. Now that was a one-nded clap. I didn't. I didn't fight him. I just said,"give him whatever he wants,just as long as he didn't kill us." I said I had ten grand in a lockbox upstairs. Here? I told him iad the money in the house. Where your kids were? I was so scared,I told him I had the money in my house. I wasn't thinking out my children. And what did your wife do? Shelby was furious. Bringing a gunman home. She... Went for the gun. That should have been me. I tried to speed to the hospital,but I screwed that up too. She died knowing I wasn't even a man. I wasn't a man that night. And I'm gonna have to live with th. But I'm gonna be one to my kids. It's what she would have wanted. I asked you to leave me alone. You didn't listen to me. You know,I bet he lived his whole life thking if it ever came down to it, he'd be the hero. Don't u think like that? Even if he id's manny,it's not gonna stick. A jury will never believe him. He's changed his story too many times. Too many times. Our killer is gonna walk. He's gonna walk. Didn't I tell you top that? Didn't i? If manny's gonna walk,we might as well give him a ride. Amigo! Give me one lucky lucky. hey,what's up,manny? Hey,you know,I heard you got busted. You beat it?
