 Her family died, and she got a new one. And don't you dare try to find her. What they saw Hello ? Charlie ? The door was open. Cupcakes ? You want one ? You should lock your door. I called twice. Phone,pool,Tina,Gina... I did what you asked. The children's service records on Rachel Seybolt. You had them unsealed ?

 What do you want with Rachel Seybolt? She used to call me her uncle. That was a long time ago. I think... Seeing what she went through,she might need some help. I think seeing what I went through,I might be in a position to do that. I had Rachel Seybolt's records unsealed. The file was gone. The jacket was empty. It's not some big conspiracy, Charlie. It's social services. I'm sure the records... Fell behind a filing cabinet. Cupcakes ? You think they're not good for me ? I don't think... You should be living on them. I didn't think i'd be living at all. I know, Charlie. I know. Look, I heard the scream, and then I called security. By the time the idiot guard showed up, it was too late. Stephanie, Honey,these are the police, not the security company. Don't edit me, Drew. Just back off. All right, clear those people from the front. We don't need a mob out there. And I want their statements asap. Detective Crews called in and said he was already here. Find him. Copy that. What do we got ? Victim, male, gunshot, master bedroom. Can't find the gun. Signs of a break-in. The back door's busted. Yeah, so the alarm went off. You know how many false alarms I get ? Check his gun. It ain't real. Company's afraid they'll get sued if I shoot anybody... Not that I ever get to. All right,where are we ? Anyone seen Detective Crews ? You got a problem with gay mariage,officer ? I embrace our city's rich diversity, detective, like the department policy says I should. Mm-hmm, you find his ring ? Oh,god! LAPD. Show me your hands ! Hey! Do you not see the gun ? What do you got up there, a costco ? Cut it out. Now, get down here, or I'm comin' up after you. Oh, jeez. I just bought this suit. This is Len Sand's partner, James Muthupalanianppanwikma something. Hi. James. Let me help you up. I'm Detective Reese. How could anyone kill Lenny? Everybody loved Lenny. Did Mr. Sand wear a wedding ring? Both did, always. We had them made special. We found your partner. Get up. You do not throw things at the LAPD. You're lucky i'm enlightened. Yeah, well, I'm not as enlightened as my partner. He was hiding down here. I identified myself. He threw a toaster at me. Throwing toasters at the LAPD is bad. Makes you look like you're guilty of something. Are you ? You got anything in your pockets that'll stick me ? Look at this. You got a dead man's wedding ring in your pocket. You know that? You're under arrest for the murder of Len Sand. Take him away. You just called me your partner. When ? Just now. No,I didn't. Yeah,you did. No. I never said that. You heard her, didn't you ? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents sync:YTET-֥ʿ???? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Life Season 01 Episode 04 You meant to rob, not hurt anybody, right? It was an accident. Where's the gun, by the way ? You've been drinking ? Smells like it. So you were drunk. You didn't know what you were doing. All right, I am trying to help you. Anyone dies during a burglary, it's first-degree murder, special circumstances. You're looking at the gurney. Baby powder! For the poison ivy you got. You ran through it on the hill. I know to avoid it, but you must have not seen it. I'd really like to get outta here. I don't like it inside so much. Can't breathe in here ? Yeah,that's right. How'd you know ? Why are you shouting ? Am I ? It's been so long since I talked to anybody,and my voice... Sounds weird ? Yeah,that's right. Like someone else whispering in your ear ? How did you know ? What's your name ? Holt Easley, and I'm 61 years old. You ever been arrested ? Not for nothin' like murder. I don't think I ever even picked up a felony. All right,why were you in the backyard ? I live there. It's better than shelters. I never been in the house,though. How come you had the victim's ring in your pocket ? I found it. I did,I swear. Swear to god ! What were you trying to get away from ? If I say... Can I go ? No. Can I get a drink? No! But if you confess,we won't charge you with murder one... or for assaulting Detective Crews. Or for stealing Detective Reese's pen. I seen that guy who lives with Sands kill him. James. I seen him shoot him in the head. Then I seen him go out and throw that ring in the hills. I found it. I was gonna trade it for booze. Here. Take it. Anything that goes down his pants, you keep. So what do you think ? Well... I think he's lying. I know he's a drunk and a thief. Or a nonconformist, a western archetype, cowboy on the range. You actually believe the crap you say ? It's not important what I believe. It's important what he believes. You give a flower sun, it opens up. You give a man respect, same thing. You think you're workin' him. He's working you. Drunks are great at telling you what you wanna hear. Now you think he's innocent. How long did you work on the charlie Crews case? Four years. {\a6}Constance Griffiths Attorney for Charlie Crews That's a tremendous commitment. Most things worthwhile are. Now that Charlie Crews is free, do you need someone else to save ? It's not about what I need. Crews, isn't it ? Oh... Hey, uh... I'm Neil Cudahy. You... You're the reason i'm sittin' here. Is that right ? Yeah,when I saw on tv that Constance Griffiths got you out,I said... That girl's gotta be my lawyer. Is that right ? Charged with assaulting a man I don't even know,you know? Can you believe that ? But the sweetest part is I don't even have to pay. She's doing me pro bono. Did she do you pro bono ? Charlie ? What are you doing here ? We have an appointment. Yes, we do, Charlie. Later today. I can't really figure out this calendar. What's with that Cudahy guy ? He's a client. I wanna talk to you about him. Well, I can't talk to you about a client. You know that. What are you doing ? Come back when your appointment is scheduled. Settle down. What's all my stuff doing here ? You mean that stuff you stole ? I never stole a thing in my life. You stole my pen. Hey, everything I got in this world, including your pen, I found. You can't believe what rich people throw out. It works. If I had a place to plug it in, i'd use the hell outta that. Got me through the winter. There was five bucks, a chapstick, and six rubbers in the pocket. And I kept 'em just in case. One time I found nine clay pigs. Only thing they don't throw out is alcohol. Why would James kill Len ? We talked to their neighbors. They said James and Len seemed happy together. But I can tell you this. What seems isn't always what is... Especially with rich people. Can you prove any of this ? Did anyone ever see you dumpster dive ? That security guard run me off a few times. Smith. You can go ask him. I ain't afraid. Except for the... Confusion over your pen, I ain't lied once. Homeless guy. No, I never saw a homeless guy living back there. You're not real bright, are you, Mr. Smith ? About average, I guess. Why ? Is there a reason you ignored the alarm ? And the call from the neighbor about a scream ? I didn't like going by the Sand place. It made me kinda sick. 'cause they're gay ? No, 'cause I'm lazy. Are we done ? Okay, the guard didn't know Easley was living in the backyard. Meaning he doesn't back Easley's story. Maybe the guard's lying. The coroner found fibers. It looks like the shooter wore gloves. The guard Smith wore gloves that night. We tested him. There was no gunshot residue. Easley says he saw James. Let's see if James says he saw Easley. Yes, this is my jacket, and these are all our things. Were these stolen from your house the night your husband Len was killed ? No. We threw these things away months ago. Where did you find them ? A concerned citizen turned them over to us. With this. Where's the rest of it ? Sorry ? Well,the rest of the things that were taken ? It means the world to me that you found Len's ring, but you didn't find anything else. You seem surprised. I'm not surprised, disappointed. The things that were stolen were the things that Len loved best. A watch, his mother's candlesticks. They, uh, they left all the expensive things. How would they know what was most important to Len ? I... I don't know. But whoever did is knew Len well. Really well. So if the neighbors were near enough to hear a scream... What else did they hear ? Len and James were a great couple. They loved each other so much. You never heard them fight? No,that's why I called Smith right away when I heard the scream. But it took him forever to get here. Tell them about your theory, Drew. It's not a theory, Stephanie. It's not anything. I just heard Officer Smith say things... Terrible things, homophobic things, particularly about Len and James. Drew thinks that Smith killed Len. He thinks it was a hate crime. I never said that. Yes, you did, all right? Don't be a liar. I mean, you're such a hypocrite. Oh, hypocrite. My, my. Has somebody been reading? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot. Well, then don't act like one. All rich people are crazy. It's not just you. I think i'll give you my card. Okay. Drew says it's the guard. Easley says it's James. Yep... They call themselves neighbors, but they don't seem very neighborly. Detective Crews ? Yes ? I couldn't talk before, but my husband Drew... Killed Len Sand. I want your promise my identity won't be revealed. We'll certainly do all we can to protect your anonymity. Why do you think your husband is the person who killed Len Sand ? Because, sadly, my husband is... A homosexual. He was having an affair with Len Sand. I think Len wanted to call it off, so Drew killed him. You saw this ? You saw the murder ? I saw Drew leaving Len's house that night after I heard the scream. That's why I called Smith the security guard, to tell him that I heard the scream. Because I didn't want Drew to know that I saw him. You heard what Drew said. He's trying to frame Smith for this. Do you have proof ? I'm his wife. He hid things from me. I wouldn't testify against him anyway. Truth is... I love him I just can't stand to live with this anymore. Look, if we solve this fast, we won't have to book Easley. Why do you care ? Well, I like the guy. If I was a cowboy, he'd be my goofy sidekick. Kinda like how you're mine. An affair. Len and Drew Borns were having an affair. Are you serious ? Mrs. Borns seems to think so. She said that she saw Drew leave here the night of the shooting. Did you ever suspect that Drew and Len would have an affair ? No. I an,but they were good friends. I always used to tease len that he and drew would make a great couple. I suspected that drew was closeted,but I... Look,it's... It's possible. We don't have enough evidence to take to a grand jury to charge Drew or James. We got an eyewitness who says it was James. A drunk homeless guy that we should have booked eight hours ago! If the grand jury believes Easley, we can arrest James. Plus, Easley won't last in jail. No, if we don't book him, we're gonna loose him. We can't babysit him forever, Crews. Sorry. I ain't gonna last too long in county,boss. Easley, listen, they got a good medical wing in there, okay ? Just tell 'em you have Hep C. But I don't have Hep C. It'll buy you a few days in the infirmary while they run tests... Now you just hang in there. Oh, I'll hangin there, for sure. Give me something... Something that proves you're telling the truth. What the hell you think I been doing ? I can't think straight inside. I need to breathe. I can't in here. The window. There's a man with a gun. You see it, Easley ? Look at it hard. I told you, it's James shooting the gun. Tell me everything you see. James is pissed off. He's got the gun. What do you want ? What's he wearing ? A tie. And a suit, I guess. And gloves. He's got gloves on. You told him to say that ? No,I didn't. I swear. Smith wore gloves. Gloves like those ? No,they were different. Come on, let's go. The coroner's report backs his story. He s what happened. That's how he knows about the gloves. Or he knows about them because he's the killer. Look at him. He look like someone who shot a guy to death ? If so, let's book him. If not... It's time. Bus leaves in five minutes. Boss,please,don't make me go ! Hey, nobody's taking you anywhere. I promise. All right, all right, all right, all right. Thanks. Thank you. He's ready, you know ? We got him. He, uh... We'll take him to the d.a. Now, so thanks a lot. Come on. What ? You never saw a bluff ? - I'm kinda hungry. - Tough! I could eat something. What did I just say? Could we get burgers? I could go for a burger. No! We gotta eat. Tacos? I could go for tacos. That's it! If either of you says another thing about food or about anything, i'm gonna turn this car right back around, and I'm taking him back to jail! What's that smell? That's humanity,baby. This is the right time,isn't it? Yes,but,um,who's your friend? Easley. If you're hungry,there's fruit in the kitchen. I think he's a witness. Although there's a chance he's the killer. Why is he here? I figured if he's guilty,then you get a new client. If he's innocent,you get a new cause. He's better than Neil Cudahy. I checked his files. Neil is not a good guy. You checked his files? I need a toilet. Down the hall and to the right. Haven't you got a private one? Easley,be neat. Neil Cudahy is a client. You are not allowed to check his files. I'm okay! Okay,no problem. - You got a.. A real nice setup in there. - Thank you. Can you go back in just for one moment? Because we're not done. I'd rather not. It's kinda rank. What's this stack of mail? That's your bills. And I really wish you wouldn't have Ted pay them. Ted's good with money. Ted is good at stealing money. There's this from the alcohol and tobacco commission. It's your liquor license from the bar that you and your partner owned. Since you were acquitted,you're entitled to have it back,if you want it. They fired me. 'cause of not answering that alarm call. You know,we never found the stuff that was stolen the night that Sand was shot. You didn't happen to see any of it when you were poking around there, did ya? I never poked around the Sands' place. I don't like to be near the gays. 'cause you can catch being gay. There's that,yeah. Why'd you lie about Easley? He says you knew that he was living there. I knew it looked bad,him living there. Oh,screw it. They fired me anyway. Rich people suck. A liquor license is hard to get. That's a valuable asset, Charlie. Hey,excuse me. This is myplate. That's your plate there. You weren't eating. Well,because I was talking! Can I work in your bar,boss? Look...Okay. You know what? Here. You eat while the adults talk,okay? I could run that for you, Charlie. I would love to run a bar. The last time I ran a bar,my partner ended up dead. Well,what are the odds of that happening twice? That lady lawyer says he steals,boss. I heard her. All right,again. Tell me what you saw that night in detail. You gotta get me a drink if you're gonna keep goin'. Maybe we should let him sleep. Easley is e only way we can get to James. First is getting the grand jury to believe that Easley saw James shoot Sand. If they do,they'll indict. If they don't,then we got nothing else, and James gets away with murder. I'm getting you something to drink. Wait. We don't want him hung over in the grand jury. When was your last hangover? 1974. He's a functioning alcoholic. He works better with booze. Trust me. They got drew borns at the station for questioning. He's there right now,no lawyer. What do we do with Easley? This ain't bad. When I come back,i'm gonna bring you something to help you sleep. I'll be waiting. I'm not a killer. I run my own hedge fund,for god's sake. Stephanie and I fit,but I can't believe she thinks I'm a killer. Do you believe she thinks you're gay? Yes,I can believe that. Really? Why is that? She's very aggressive sexually. I work hard,long hours. I get tired. Whenever I don't want to have sex,she accuses me of being gay. She's intolerant,homophobic,unstable. I love her. I'm wealthy enough to take care of her. But I won't go to prison for something I didn't do. Any more questions,call me. I've got nothing to hide. But don't you dare accuse me of anything. You know,most cases we get no eyewitnesses. This case,we get two... And they both suck. Stephanie says it was Drew. Easley says it was James. Do you really think Easley's lying? No. No. If he were,he would have jumped on blaming Drew,you know? Gave him the chance,but he wouldn't do that. Oh,my god. I locked him in. Is anybody hurt? Excuse me,is... What'd you bring me? I fell asleep smoking. I'm sorry. Fire department come and cut me out. Where'd you get the booze? I'm gonna be honest with you. There's a liquor store on the corner. When the owners... Come out to see what all the fuss was about, I went in and... Took a few things. Crews,from now on,he's all yours. 24/7. You wanted him. You got him. Sand's will was filed in probate court. It says that James gets all of Sand's property when he dies. James had a financial motive. Did Drew have a financial motive? No. Drew's rich. If he killed James,it wasn't for the money. Who are you? I'm Charlie's roommate. No. I'm Charlie's roommate. Easley's staying at your house? Yes,and he's been touching my stuff,Charlie. I think he used my toothbrush. Did not. Smell my breath. I ain't even close to minty. If I used your toothbrush,i'd be minty. I ain't the kinda guy who uses another guy's toothbrush. So how many coffees did you let him have,Ted? Six. Once we got that machine of yours going,we really let it ride. All right,just take him home,get him cleaned up. He is going to the grand jury. We are going to bring sexy back to the bar scene. Our target demographic is gonna be 18- to 29-year-olds,at least initially,to create buzz. Gotta be 21 to drink. We're gonna serve tapas and sushi. You gotta get the young in for the dancing,the old will then follow. I wouldn't drink there. It's too fancy. Yeah. You are not our target demographic. Okay? Our specialties will be coladas and daiquiris. Sounds fruity. You know what? Charlie happens to like fruit. And the markup on fruit drinks is huge. All right,let's talk names. One word names are very hot right now,okay? "Stir" is good. Also "Shaken." Sounds fruity. You oughta grow more trees outside,boss. Give you privacy. Nobody'll see when you kill Ted. Nice suit. It's Ted's. It's too clean. Nothing in the pockets,not even lint. I used to keep a big rubber band in my pocket. It lost its snap,dried out. I really liked that rubber band. Are you gonna make it? I don't think so. Come on,we're gonna be waiting outside for you here all the time. You ain't goin' inside? No,no. Witnesses in the grand jury have to be in there alone. Oh, Crews, he's not gonna make it. What are we gonna do? All right. Witness prep? If we don't indict now,James is gone. You want Easley's testimony or not? I feel better,boss. Reese. Okay. Thanks. What? What? Your new friend here said he'd never been in Sand's house? Labs came back. His dna was all over it. You're not going to the grand jury. You're going to jail. You were the lead detective on the Charlie Crews murder case? Yeah,I work that case. Took my 20 right after we closed it. No dna's gonna tell me we got the wrong guy. {\a6}Detective Carl Ames (retired) Lead Detective Crews murder case Crews, Easley's dna is in the house. How do we explain that? He's got a nice smile. Uh... I'm not sure I know what you mean by that. Well,for a guy who lives in the woods,he's got a nice smile. Ted said he used his toothbrush. You know,I think he was minty. I don't know what dna is. How'd I know how it got in the house? I ain't lying. Okay,boss,I used Ted's toothbrush 'cause I didn't have one. And you tracked mud in and out of our house. You take your shoes off when you went into Sand's place? Just to use the bathroom now and then. You know,to get clean. You should have told us sooner. I didn't say nothin' 'cause I know it looks bad. But I never went inside unless I knew no one was home. How could you tell? Windows. They had the most and fewest trees. You're lying. I'm not lying this time. I swear it! Prove it right now,or I walk outta here,you go back to D unit and you die there. What do you want me to say? I'll say whatever you tell me. Wait,boss. Please don't leave me. I'm not your boss. I'm not your friend... And I'm not giving you any more chances. You're all out. Okay,okay. I can prove James Mermerha... I can't say his name. He's the one who did it. But we're gonna need a shovel. Crews... I'm telling you,he's playin' us. Because there is nothing under here that even... Clay pig. Okay. You got that list of things James said was stolen? Yeah. First item. Four folders of antique coins. Yep. Got those in here. Ah? How 'bout sterling silverware? Yep. Got that too. Ah,what about letters? No. No letters. Love letters. Signed by... Drew Borns. You wanna know what else is in here? What? Yes,I wrote those letters. My fingerprints could well be on the things in the bag too. Len always showed off those things when we'd go over to visit. You stole the letters,along with the other things that Len Sand loved. Why? They're all addressed to "my Love." No name. Those are letters that I gave to my wife Stephanie. Can you prove that? No,Detective,I don't keep copies of love letters to my wife I didn't know I needed to. James and Stephanie put that stuff there,hoping we'd find it and blame Drew. They didn't count on Easley taking it and burying it. But how do we prove it? The frame worked. Drew looks guilty. We know that. We know James and Stephanie know that. They don't know we know. What they do know is that if we found the bag,we'd focus on Drew. So then they know what to say when we come. And so? I'm not hearing a plan. Well,let's see if they embrace not knowing what they don't know. No. No,I didn't get it. Are you sure? Okay. I'll look for it again. Can I ask why you called me down here? It's not a big thing. Would... Would you just give me one minute? This isn't something we could do over the phone? Maybe I should have 'em send it down again. Oh,here it is. Have a seat,Stephanie. Do you know how I got that bag? Why would I know that? James gave me that bag. That's what he's out there talking to Detective Crews about right now. So,James,your neighbor,Stephanie Borns,found the items that you reported stolen. She's in there with my partner giving her statement. Whe... Um... When did she find them? She called this morning. But don't worry. Your items are all being indexed,and they will be returned to you... Plus a few you left out. Left out? What... What things? I got the list here. You don't know what's in the bag? No,I told you I don't know. 'cause James said you do. He told my partner that you know exactly what's in that bag. Two "lali-kay" candlesticks. Am I pronouncing that right,"la-li-kay"? Lalique. That's glass. Glass,right? It's french glass. Weird,her bringing the bag in here like that. It's your stuff. You'd think she'd just call you about it. I guess people just like to cooperate with the police. James gave me this bag and said that you shot Len Sand. That you shot his husband. He's finalizing his official statement with Detective Crews right now. You got a first edition book on bondage. Of human bondage. "mog-ham"? Maugham. French,like the glass? English,like the language. He says you shot Len Sand using that gun,Stephanie. It has your husband's fingerprints all over it My husband's prints. James said you wanted to set Drew up for that murder, So you shot Len Sand and left the gun and these other objects for us to find. Why would I do that? I had no motive to kill Len. I liked him. We couldn't figure out the motive. You didn't get anything from Len Sand's death. That's true. I didn't. But you'd get everything if Drew was blamed for it. Come on, Stephanie. Drew's rich,you're not. He controls all the money. Your prenup states that you get everything if Drew gives you cause for a divorce. Now, a murder conviction. Guess what? That's cause. You and James both make out. You get all of Drew's money, he gets all of Len Sand's. But James over there... got cold feet and brought us this bag. Okay,let me see. Almost done. Here we go. One Patek-Philippe chronograph. What is that? A watch. You should have just put that down here. I'll fix that for you. It's okay. w- a-t-c-h. Watch. He says you shot Sand, Stephanie. He gave us this bag and said that you shot Sand. You had access to your husband's gun. It makes sense. But these are all on the list. Just one last item here. We got an Automatic 40 caliber. That's a gun, James. Should I write it down that way? g... u... n. Come on, Stephanie. Time's running out. Talk now or pay later. Okay,okay. I... I.. I did take the gun. Okay,but I didn't kill Len. Okay,I gave the gun to James. He shot him. He did it... Look, I was gonna get Drew's money. He was gonna get Len's. But I never shot anyone,okay? We were gonna frame Drew,but James shot Len... Not me. Not me. They've been in there a long time,my partner and Stephanie. I wonder what they're talking about. Stephanie's pretty high-strung. You notice that? Oh,god. What did you tell them? What have you done? What have you done? James. You put your bag on the hillside,knowing we'd find it. You didn't count on hot Easley, finding it first and burying it again. That was gonna be his treasure. That bag of stolen stuff I found was gonna be my ticket. Well, if you want to stay at my house for a while,that's not a problem. Sure,boss. Just might do that. That way,he can use the bathroom when he wants to without committing a felony. Well,a man's gotta stay minty. Isn't that right, Easley? That's right. See? Minty. {\a6}Detective Carl Ames (retired) Lead Detective Crews murder case And the daughter,where was she? She was at a sleepover. How many times I gotta tell you that? She was there,wasn't she? Her bed was unmade. She was there when it happened,not at a sleepover. Rachel was in the house. Hello? Hello. Jeez,Charlie. You scared me. I didn't mean to. What are you doing here? I,uh... I wanna ask you to do something,and I just need you to do it. Charlie,tell me why you're here. I need you to drop Neil Cudahy as a client. You need me to? What does that mean? You know what that means. Do you want to save him,Connie? I'm just defending him. Do you wanna save him like you saved me? 'Cause he's not me,connie. What are you asking? I'm asking you to drop Neil Cudahy. That's all you're asking? Yeah. Don't back away from this,Charlie. You started it when you came here tonight. I just want you to drop Neil Cudahy. You don't have the right to ask that. Unless you want that right. Do you,Charlie? I was looking for you,and I didn't even know it. And now you're here,and I can't have you. You're married. And if I weren't? You have a husband. And I think about...You... when I'm with him. I need you to be all the way in. And if you can't be all the way in... Then I need you all the way... Out. You know I can't do this. Yeah. Okay. Whatever it is that you're doing is keeping you from being here. You're still in prison. The next time you're gonna have to get another lawyer to get you out. He was here this afternoon. I saw him. He asked if I would buy him a giant rubber band. Said he used to have one but that it... Dried up. Lost its snap. Poor easy. I thought telling the truth would set him free. When's that ever worked? She saw him. She saw the killer. sync:YTET-֥ʿ???? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Life Season 01 Episode 04
