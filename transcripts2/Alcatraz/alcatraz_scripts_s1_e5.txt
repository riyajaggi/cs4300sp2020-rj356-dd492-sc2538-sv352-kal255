 NARRATOR: Previously on Alcatraz: Meet the '63s. The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back. Grandfather wasn't a guard, he was an inmate. - Unh! REBECCA: No! He killed my partner. Dr. Soto, this is my Uncle Ray. DOC: Ray Archer's your uncle? - Sort of. He raised me after my parents died. RAY: This isn't your case, is it? - This is about Alcatraz. You worked... - Damn it, Rebecca. Let it go. REBECCA: Police!

 So we have to find these '63s. We need to find who took them. Where have you been for the past 50 years? I don't know. [SHIP HORN BLOWING] [LITTLE GIRL CHATTERING IN GUY'S MIND] [WOMAN HUMMING IN GUY'S MIND] [LITTLE GIRL LAUGHING IN GUY'S MIND] RANGER: Hey, what are you doing? You don't belong here. [ALARM CLOCK BUZZING] [ALARM CLOCK STOPS BUZZING] Up before the alarm, huh? Just excited, I guess.

 Good morning, sunshine. - Why don't you call in sick. - No, ma'am. Not today. Today's a training day. ANNIE: Daddy! GUY: Aah. - Somebody's up bright and early, huh? - Mommy measured me last night. - That's who's been drawing on the walls? BETTY: Yes, sirree. Forty-two inches. GUY: What a big girl. [BETTY CHUCKLES] What? Just never thought we'd be so happy. Here of all places. [THUNDER CRACKING] Gentlemen, welcome to Alcatraz. I'm Guy Hastings, your training officer. Now, most of you won't last the day. Those who do, won't be eager about the next. Alcatraz is the most dangerous prison in the world. My job is to make sure you survive. Look to me. Trust me. Because on Alcatraz... ...no man can do it alone. - Now sound off. - John Kawalaski. - William Hutch. - David O'Connor. - Leonard Burntree. - Aaron Lansky. Ray Archer. This is Tommy, and that's me. And that's where we grew up. REBECCA: Wow. So you didn't meet my grandfather at Alcatraz. You knew him before. Did he really kill my grandmother? I didn't think so. And then I did. REBECCA: Why'd he do it? RAY: I don't know. I just had to let it go. To raise me. I knew Tommy my whole life. He was my best friend. Are you still ordering half the menu? No, I don't do that anymore. [WOMAN SPEAKING IN CHINESE] [RAY CHUCKLING] WOMAN: Enjoy. [CELL PHONE BEEPING] Ah, shoot. - Was that it? - Yeah, that's it. Okay. Here you go. No, no, that's yours. - Go ahead. Keep it. - Oh, thanks. Whatever you don't eat, can you have them box it up? I'll eat it later. RAY: Sure. - I'd rather clothe you than feed you. - Bye, Ray. HAUSER: A ranger was attacked in Building 64 about an hour ago. Fractured skull, punctured lung. Now, this man... ...was seen leaving the building moments later. He took the 9 a.m. Ferry back to the mainland. Is that Guy Hastings? It certainly is. - What did he do to end up on the Rock? - He didn't do anything. - He wasn't an inmate. He was a guard. - That's right. Our first guard. He attacked a ranger? Why? The guards were good men. If Hastings attacked a ranger... ...someone put him up to it. - Someone? - Like who? Whoever took the '63s. Oh, right. Those guys. What do you think they sent him back here to do? That's what we have to figure out. NARRATOR: On March 21st, 1963... ... Alcatraz officially closed. All the prisoners were transferred off the island. Only that's not what happened. Not at all. REBECCA: Talk about cramped quarters. Guards paid 28 bucks a month to live in these apartments. Can't beat the view. What do you know about Hastings? Uh. Navy guy. He served in Korea. Came to the Rock with his family in '57. The official story was that he died in a chemical spill... ...along with eight other guards in '63. I wrote about it in one of my books. Which I guess makes me a fraud. Excellent. Any idea why Guy came here? Yeah. This was his apartment. - What is it? - Blood. Well, if he attacked the ranger over there... ...why is there blood here? Two clips. He's got a gun. Question is, what's he gonna do with it? REBECCA: Who knows? We're chasing a guy with no record, no case files, no MO. - How are we supposed to find him? DOC: I know where we can start. Annie, that was his daughter. Look at these markings. She couldn't have been more than 7 or 8 when they lived here. Find her. REBECCA: And tell her what? "You know, your dad who for 50 years you thought was dead is kind of back. And we were, you know... ...wondering if maybe you've seen him." Not that. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - You're writing a new book. - I am? - I'm your research assistant. - You are? ANNIE: Hi, can I help you? Hi. Hello. My name is Dr. Diego Soto. That's me. Are you Guy Hastings' daughter Annie? ANNIE: Alcatraz was an amazing place to live. My parents never even locked the doors. That's your dad there, right? And me. I was 8 when he died. I remember he'd come in after a shift and he'd lie on the floor... ...and I'd climb on him like he was furniture. You remember the last time you saw him? Yeah. He walked me down to the boat to go to school. And that afternoon, Mama was at the pier waiting for me. She said there'd been some kind of accident. A chemical spill on the island. They wouldn't let us back. So we stayed at a motel. And then the call came. He died. They sent us his things a few days later... ...but they never told us what happened. Do you have any of his things from Alcatraz? Well, I have the box the prison sent us. Could we maybe take it with us? I mean, I promise I'll bring it back. Scout's honor. And I was. A Scout. Welcome to the mess hall... ...aptly dubbed the Gas Chamber. - Comforting name. Fourteen tear gas canisters fixed to the ceiling. Got to at least credit them for inspiration. Gentlemen. You are in the most dangerous room in the most dangerous prison in the world. Prisoners sit where they please... ...and they move freely to and from chow line. MAN: Here, Madsen. GUY: You gotta have eyes in the back of your head. Archer, eyes on me, kid. Warden James saw fit to loosen the leash as far as meals. Felt dignity would go a way towards obedience. That don't mean the men feel obligated to fall in line. Just last week, Red Stevens used a steak bone... ...to open Billy Haskin's throat. No. No. - No! PRISONER 1: Fight! Fight! Fight! [CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] You shouldn't have come here. Madsen, you just earned yourself a trip to the hole. PRISONER 2: Come on, let them go! RAY: I'll be right back, J.T. GUY: Don't move. - No one has to get hurt here. - Shut up. Put your hands up. Now turn around. Guy? DOCTOR: Hold still, son. RAY: It hurts. Sorry. Forgot the anesthetic. On account I don't usually bother. Heh, heh, heh. Hilarious. - He gonna be okay, doc? - Right as rain... ...by the time a cigarette burns through. I've never seen a mess tray go so deep. Fellow did this must have had a real itching for you. He better be much worse off than he looks. DOCTOR: Cracked skull is all, warden. Someone wanna tell me why I cut short flower picking with my little one... ...on account of a flesh wound? I only sent for Mr. Deputy Warden Tiller, sir. As protocol requires. If you were bothered from your afternoon's excursion... ...that's entirely on someone else. Tommy Madsen takes one look at the new screw and attacks him. That's not strange to you? We live on 22 acres of solid rock... ...inhabited by murderers, thieves and rapists. Strange went out the window upon arrival. They know each other, is the point. Archer could be here to bust Madsen out. Plenty of lags go after new screws. No one here has not seen that before. JAMES: Archer. - Yes, warden? - Where does your courage stand... ...post-mess hall tussle? Ready as ever, sir. Let him stay and tussle could lead to escape attempt. Up to you, Hastings. Shall we pull Archer close to our teat... ...or send him on his merry way? Kid is green. There's no arguing that. But most men beat like that make fast for the hills. So if Archer wants to stay... ...I say we give him a shot. Settled. Any further botheration, it's Hastings' rump on the line. Usually we find makeshift sniper scopes or contraband in these boxes. This one's full of good-guy stuff. What exactly are we looking for? Connection to the past. Anything that can tell us where he might be headed. HAUSER: Anything? REBECCA: Nothing on the day's crime reports that point to Guy Hastings. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Hey, can I call you back? J.T. [ON PHONE]: Hey, Rebecca. It's J.T. - Your Uncle Ray's missing. - I just saw him. He left to take out the trash but never came back. All right. I'll be right there. Ray's missing. Missing? Yeah, I have to go. I'll go with you. You think this has something to do with Hastings? Rebecca? REBECCA: It's Hastings and Ray. They knew each other. Looks like they were friends. Guy. What the hell is going on? You died. - Where is he, Ray? - Who? Tommy Madsen. Tommy? Don't you lie to me. I know you know him. I know him same as you do. He was a prisoner at Alcatraz. Stop lying! You look exactly the same. How is it possible? You got to have a whole life... ...didn't you, Ray? You got to raise a family. You got to... ...live. What happened to you, Guy? You know Tommy Madsen same as me, huh? What the hell is that? That's you and Tommy. [RAY SIGHS] - Where is he, Ray? - He's dead. - Died in '64. - Is that what they told you? It ain't true. Same as I'm here... ...so is he. Madsen had a son. You can't find Tommy, take me to his son. - I can't take... - You can, Ray. And you're going to. REBECCA: Any word on Ray? No, it's been almost two hours. He left his cell on the bar. I tried his apartment, but it was busy. You seen anyone unusual hanging around this bar? No, just the regulars. How about this man? Have you seen him? Yeah, I saw him standing across the street... ...when I was coming in this morning. How do you have his picture? I'm going to Ray's apartment. Wait here in case he comes back. [PHONE DIAL TONE BLEEPING] REBECCA: Ray? HAUSER: Clear. [DIAL TONE STOPS BLEEPING] They were here. What is that? Ray's watch. I bought it for him when I was 13. Three months' allowance. He's worn it every day since. - He is trying to tell me something. - That he was alive when they left? Why Ray? He wasn't even on the Rock when it closed. Well... Maybe Guy isn't after Ray. - He came here looking for something. - Or someone. That's Ray and my grandfather. Tommy Madsen. Guy's not after Ray. He's after Tommy. Why would the people who took the '63s be after my grandfather? I don't know. GUY: So how you feel today, kid? RAY: If I say in confidence that I'm shook up, does that put me on the first boat out? GUY: No. Any man gets beat like that is bound to get the shakes. But I put myself on the line for you yesterday, Mr. Archer... ...so I'm only gonna ask once. Do you know Tommy Madsen? No, sir. I do not. Well, if that's the truth, Archer, then we got a whole other conundrum... ...because the only currency on Alcatraz that really matters is respect. Now... A hundred men saw Madsen split your head open. Blood is in the water, and by now they all smell it. Now, you say you don't know Madsen. Prove it. What's going on? HAUSER: I need to see you. What's the deal with the Batphone? - He picks it up and someone's there? HAUSER: I need everyone in the room. Yes. Now. The room, huh? Why's he going in there? What happened with Ray? Guy Hastings took him. We think he's using Ray to find my grandfather. You know, Guy wasn't just any guard. He was Ray's training officer. And training officers kept logs. And during Ray's first week, he was attacked by an inmate. What inmate? Your grandfather. - Does it say why? - No. But Guy broke it up. Okay. How do you go from best friends to fighting at the mess hall at Alcatraz? God, I know this house. Here's a photo Ray gave me this morning. - Same place Tommy and Ray grew up. - So a man Ray hasn't seen... ...in 50 years shows up looking for Tommy. - Who Ray thinks is dead. - When I found out Ray was missing... ...the first place I went to was his house. So if I'm Guy... I have Ray take me to the place Tommy grew up. We have the house number, we just have to find out what street it's on. If we build out the rest based on architecture... ...we could maybe find what neighborhood. That'll lead us to Ray. But for this, we need a pro. You wanted me to take you to Tommy's son? There he is. Everyone connected with Tommy is dead. I'm the only one left. I know you, Guy. You never wanted to hurt anyone. Why are you looking for Tommy? It's what they told me. - What who told you? - You were there. You saw what they were doing to him. All that blood. The weeks in the infirmary. Did Tommy tell you? Is that why you left? No. I left to raise his son. "Beloved husband and father." The blond in the pictures. She's too young to be yours. Take it easy. If she's Van's daughter, it's Tommy's granddaughter? - She's damn near his spitting image. - Leave her out of this, Guy. So maybe she knows where Tommy is. Okay. Okay. I'll take you to Tommy. This is your pro? Chet the stock boy? Check it out. Done. REBECCA: Is that the San Mateo Bridge? - Mm-hm. All right. That means China Basin. DOC: No way. China Basin doesn't have street numbers in the hundreds. Here he goes with the maps. Daly City. Let's check census reports from the 50s. Look for Madsen and Archer and get their addresses. HAUSER: We're looking for a connection to our existing model. Tell me, the day the guard returned... ...was there an increase in seismic activity? MAN 1: Sir, do you think the keys, Tommy Madsen, the jump... ...that they're all related? Humor me. MAN 2: Nominal. Statistically insignificant... ...along the North Hayward Fault. HAUSER: Okay. Let's review what we know. The guard is looking for Madsen... ...which suggests that Madsen is unaccounted for. Or lost. Or lost. DOC: Okay, got it. There's a Madsen on Hayworth, but no Archer. Ray said they grew up together. - Same neighborhood. - Could be the wrong Madsen. "William, head of household, Laura, spouse, Tommy, son, Ra..." Ray, son? They were brothers. Ray changed his last name to work on Alcatraz. They never would've hired him if they knew. Ray's my uncle. My real uncle. GUARD: Inside me, first tier, file in! - Move! - You ready, Archer? One way to find out. I mean, yes, sir. Take your position. GUARD: At the cut-off, eyes right! These cell doors are the only thing that stands between bedlam and peace. Put them in. B, step to the line. Set the control lever to A... ...pull the clutch and release the door pins. Third lever opens the doors. Now... ...let's say we wanted all the gates open except for 112. Set the control lever to 12... ...and pull the clutch. Have at it. Opening cell doors. [CELL DOORS OPENING] Rack them. You got a captive audience, kid. PRISONERS [CHANTING]: Fight! Fight! Fight! 2002, in your cell. I'm happy to, screw, but my door ain't open. Looks open to me. GUY: Come on. Come on. That's enough. That's enough. You made your point. What is this place? This is where Tommy grew up. Tommy Madsen. Where is he? He'll be back. You lied to me. Tommy and I grew up here. If there's any place Tommy would go, it'd be here. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - What? HAUSER: Why are you in Daly City? How do you know where I am? Why are you in Daly City? He's tracking us. I'm headed to 139 Hayworth Street, but you'll know that when I get there. I'm on my way. - What are you gonna do if he's there? - I just hope he's okay. No, not Ray. Tommy. He killed my partner, Doc. [GUN CLACKING] RAY: You remember my first day on the Rock? Pouring rain. I was terrified. The only thing that kept me from jumping on the first boat home was you. What happened to you, Guy? Where have you been? Where have I been? I haven't been anywhere. I took my little one down to the dock... ...and kissed her goodbye. And that night... ...I was on the north tower... ...and the fog... ...took all the stars away. In the morning, I was in the infirmary. They told us that there had been an accident. Our f... Our families were dead. And most of us guards were in there... ...and they told us that we were sick. Contaminated. And that we couldn't leave. And then... ...it wasn't 1963 anymore. [CAR APPROACHING] She's here. Who? The blond. [DOOR OPENING] Becca, behind you. GUY: Drop it. Guy, relax. Let her go. - Shut up. - You're a good man. A family man. - No, my family's dead. - No. Annie's still alive. No, she's not. They're all dead. Listen to her, Guy. I saw her today. I swear to you, I talked to her. She told me... She told me how she used to climb on you like you were furniture. She is alive, Guy. With a husband and children. Your grandchildren. - No. - They lied to you about everything. GUY: Shut up. Mr. Hastings, on the count of three, I'm gonna shoot you in the head. RAY: Don't. You don't have a shot. - One. - He will do it. Drop the gun, Guy. - Two. - Hauser, don't. - Three. GUY: Unh! [GUY GRUNTING] RAY: I know you don't want me here. And it doesn't matter to me that you think you deserve this... ...because you don't. You're my blood and I won't leave you here alone to rot in this hellhole. I will not. You and me are in this together. GUY: Is what you said true? Is Annie really alive? Alive. With great memories of her daddy. HAUSER: Let's go. [KIDS CHATTERING] GIRL: Hi. You see those people across the street? That's your daughter Annie. Those are her children and her grandchildren. She looks so happy. Can I see her? Talk to her? No. Then why'd you bring me here? You're a casualty in this. You don't deserve what happened to you. I'm never gonna see them again, am I? No. I'm not the first Madsen you've asked to be on this task force, am I? That's why Ray's not freaking out about Guy Hastings showing up. Because he already knew what was going on. You figured he'd know how to find Tommy. I offered Ray Archer ajob 16 years ago. He turned me down. Something about raising a precocious little girl. Well, you got what you wanted anyway. Someone with ties to Tommy Madsen. Oh, is that what I wanted? Where is this going? Now I know. My grandfather is more important to you than I ever imagined... ...which means you need me more than I need you. J. T: Night, Ray. We're closed. MAN: Last call for an old friend? I told you never to come back here. Well, you gave up the house, Ray. I can't stay there anymore. What was I supposed to do? Remember when you'd do just about anything to protect me? That was before Rebecca. Yeah, Rebecca. What? It's just strange, you know, being a grandfather at my age. You're nobody's grandfather. You were always a man of strong conviction, Ray. Glad to see that hasn't changed. Turn around... ...and get the hell out of my bar. I'm going. - This isn't over. - Every moment you're near... ...puts her in harm's way. If I see you again... ...l'll kill you. [English - US - SDH]
