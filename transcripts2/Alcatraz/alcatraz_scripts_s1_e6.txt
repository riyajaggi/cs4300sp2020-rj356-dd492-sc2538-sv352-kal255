 ANNOUNCER: Previously on Alcatraz: Meet the '63s. The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back. My grandfather wasn't a guard, he was an inmate. - Ugh. No! REBECCA: That's him. Tommy Madsen? He killed my partner. Police! - We have to find these '63s. - We need to find who took them. I need you to watch them. You know, they're not so bad. - Lucy, get down! LUCY: Ugh!

 Welcome to Alcatraz, Dr. Sengupta. Thank you, Warden James. [HORN BLOWING] [GRUNTS] [VOMITING] I don't know, Hauser. Maybe the pirate life ain't for you. MAN: All right, tie it off! Now look alive. JAMES: Mr. Petty. You arrive to us with much fanfare. I can assure you... ...most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party. But then, you are a special case, aren't you? [CHUCKLES]

 A smile. On a child's face, it reminds us of all that's good and pure in this world. But on yours... ...it's all the company of Hades. If you've left more of your mines on the mainland, son... ...it will be our singular aim to find out just where they are... ...before anyone else is blown to kingdom come. Check him. Felicitations to the good men and women... ...of the San Francisco Police Department. Does the lady need a ride back to the mainland? No. The lady does not. But nice thought. Thank you. Peppermint. For your nausea. Officer? Hauser. Emerson Hauser. [BILLIE HOLIDAY'S "THESE FOOLISH THINGS" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] A cigarette that bears A lipstick's traces An airline ticket To romantic places And still my heart has wings These foolish things Remind me of you She has good taste in music, Mr. Hauser. Any improvement? I'm sorry. And if she stays here? Did she ever talk to you about a DNR? Are you saying she's dying? MAN 1: Got it? Ready? MAN 2: Hey, buddy. How you doing? Where'd you come from? [CROWD SCREAMING] MAN 3: Get back! MAN 4: Move! Get out of the way! MAN 5: They're under the ground. MAN 6: Look out! MAN 7: They're under the ground! MAN 8: Honey, come on! [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [SIRENS WAILING] WOMAN [OVER RADIO]: All units be advised: Air support en route to Pine Street Park. Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties. Bomb squad on the scene. Oh. This does not look good. MAN: Which direction? WOMAN: Yeah, no, it was just right there. MAN: Right over here? WOMAN: The south side. What kind of explosives makes a crater like this? Something small. An IED, maybe. Looks like he used the grass to hide them. Land mines. Holy crap. [DOC & HAUSER IN UNISON] It's Paxton Petty. He did this before in the early '60s. In the past, there were multiple locations. He's not finished yet. - So you know this case? - Three bombs went off. He claimed there was a fourth, but it was never found. All right. So where do we start? I'm gonna work on the locations, you're gonna work on finding Petty. Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean War. Something bad happened in Wonju, schoolchildren killed by U.S. Land mines. - Petty was the prime suspect. - That what sent him to Alcatraz? No. Court-martialed. They re-assigned him to the Presidio, graveyard detail... ...while they did the investigation. Eventually he was tried and convicted. After five years in military prison, he came back to the city... ...and starting doing this. All right, everybody down! [CROWD SCREAMING] [BOMB BEEPS] Oh, my God. [REBECCA GRUNTS] [PANTING] NARRATOR: On March 21st, 1963... ... Alcatraz officially closed. All the prisoners were transferred off the island. Only that's not what happened. Not at all. You're checking her for TBI, right? Concussions? Honestly, I barely bumped my head. Thanks. A guy is walking around with a backpack full of mines. S.F.P.D., back in '60, thought he stole it from the Presidio while he was there. The Presidio isn't a base anymore, so where's he getting them now? Maybe the same guy who bought Cobb his rifle... ...Hastings and Sylvane, their guns. Someone's helping these guys. I mean, maybe unfreezing them. It's like when Captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice... - Doc. - Right. DOC: But there's always a facilitator. I mean, Lex Luthor. Case in point. Hey, Psycho. [LAUGHS] - Hey, Psycho, what's up? - You switch to decaf yet? Ah, not a chance. I got nine lives, haven't burned through half. Oh, right. This is some ugly-looking shrapnel. - Ugly and old. - Like FDR old or Bush '41 old? TANNER: I'm thinking somewhere in between. But this puppy's been modified. Who are you? Soto. Civilian authority. - Pulled that from a tree branch. - He's putting something in them. TANNER: Most of these whack jobs add ball bearings, nails, whatever's handy... ...put them in the mines, maximize carnage. This doesn't look like some random piece of metal. You mind if I, uh? - Knock yourself out. - Thanks. Want one of me too? [CHUCKLES] NIKKl: Recording bombing victim number six. Severe lower body trauma... ...powder burns extending to mid-torso. - Becca. Hey. REBECCA: Hey, how's it going? - I hear you went to the dark side. - Federal task force, yeah. - I'm working the Pine Street bombings. - I'm her partner, Dr. Diego Soto. Hey. Sandman. Golden Age. - Nice. - Thanks. What are you pulling out of him? Why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that? - Uh, that one, please. - Okay. - Is that a laurel wreath design? - It looks like some sort of badge... ...or military medal. Hey, did you see Psycho there? - Oh, yeah. NIKKl: Ha, ha. Yeah, I have a comic-book shop over on Columbus. I have every issue of Sandman, mint condition... ...you know, if you're ever interested. I thought you said you were her partner? Oh, I am. It's just, well, I also kind of have, like, a day job. - Thanks, Nikki. - Yeah. - Or secret identity... REBECCA: Doc. Right. Yeah. "Snow, beard, grace." [GASPING] Where are the bombs, Petty? BEAUREGARD: Again. Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer? If you're offended, by all means, wait outside. Dueling sawbones. Toe to toe. Old school versus the avant-garde. - Lf you'd like me to stop, warden... - Don't be sensitive, Milton. Tell us where they are and you'll have a woolen blanket... ...with tea piping hot in a ceramic bowl waiting for your purple, pruned hands. We'll find out one way or another. He'll break. Never had a man in this tub that didn't. He's already broken, Dr. Beauregard. What we need to do is put him back together again. A prescription straight from the pad of Mother Goose herself. When you're ready to come into the 20th century, please let me know. Dr. Sengupta. Time for the talking cure. Step aside, Milton. MAN: Yes, ma'am. It's a military medal, all right. These etching lines? They symbolize rays that a laurel wreath encircles... ...in the center of which would sit a silver star. Was Petty awarded any medals in Korea? No. He thought he deserved one, though. Fired off a lot of angry letters to Uncle Sam while he was, you know, in jail. Got denied every time. So maybe this is payback, instead of ball bearings or nails. Where would you get a Silver Star if you didn't earn it? A real one? Well, you wouldn't. What about, like, Craigslist? Not from a military family I take it, sir? Silver Star is the third-highest combat military decoration. If it's not left to the family, most are buried with the soldiers. The Presidio. - Graveyard detail. - Thank you, sir. GUARD: Hey. What the hell are you doing here? [GRUNTING] My suspect worked the graveyard detail here at the Presidio... ...from 1952 to '54 during his court-martial. You think some old guy's digging up bodies to get their medals? He'd know where they were buried, right? - Silver Stars, Korean War. - Yeah, yeah. Look, uh, Forgotten Warriors on the east grounds... ...near the family plots. I gotta go back inside. - I never wear the right clothes. REBECCA: Thanks for meeting us. Doesn't look like anything's been touched. Maybe he got the medal from somewhere else. Didn't you say the cops suspected... ...Petty stole his mines from the Presidio back in '60? Yeah, and they never found his stash. Searched all the tunnels and cellars. No luck. Well, maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look. Warm in here. It's nice. What's next, crumpets? Shh. How's that? Feel like a new man. Now, that's how you treat someone you want something from, warden. JAMES: Glad you approve, son. PETTY: I've heard about the mind games here. What have you heard? - I'm not taking these pills. - There not pills, Mr. Petty. Those are mints. I drugged your tea. Just a mild sedative to help you relax. An anesthetic. You were only 18 when you joined the Marines, is that right? I'm not talking to you. You served for the Fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle. The bloodiest of the war. Fourteen Silver Stars were awarded to veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle. But not you... ...despite clearing several frozen mine fields by yourself... ...under heavy fire... ...providing safe passage for our troops to advance. Hypocrites, the lot of them. DR. SENGUPTA: It's for your safety. Were you scared, Mr. Petty? No, ma'am. Any reasonable person would be scared. PETTY: Not me, nope. DR. SENGUPTA: And they punished you for it. Made you feel like a traitor for doing yourjob. I just did what I was trained to do. I know, Mr. Petty. Cold, the fear, and the wave after wave of enemy soldiers... ...coming across those frozen fields. You never knew who the enemy might be. Even women and children. Children? Tossing land mines everywhere? Little soldiers. And so you did what you had to do. You went to the village of Wonju... ...put the mines where they got their water... ...where they played in the fields. Trying 55 volts at two-tenths of a second. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [PETTY GRUNTING] [HUMMING] That's right, Mr. Petty. It's okay. It's all going to be okay. [PETTY SINGING IN KOREAN] [PETTY SINGING IN KOREAN PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] You were in the 45th Division in Korea, Mr. Madsen? If you know, why are you asking? You got your degree in medical doctoring, right? I did my residency in Internal Medicine. Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man... ...spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail? I assumed you were ill. Well, you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking. I know all about the new lag. The one who likes to blow things up. Is that his voice on the tape? If you wanna know what the song is... ...then you find out why I am in here all the time. Deal. The song? It's a Korean lullaby. The thing about land mines... ...is you gotta remember where you put them. Otherwise, you blow up your own men. Lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information. One word in each line indicated a different location. We did the same thing. Crosby and Sinatra. HAUSER: "Snow. Beard. Grace." Snow. Beard. Grace. Where are you putting them now? Little brook in the woods. There's more. A second verse. "Among the pines you flow." Pine Street. It matches. Broke the lock and put a new one on. Yeah, and the kicker is it looks like he broke it from the inside. He broke out, not in? This is where he came back. Let's find out. [GUN COCKS] REBECCA: Looks like somebody was painting. There's paint over here too. Doc, give me a hand with this. [BOTH GRUNT] DOC: You were right. This is where he hid his stash in 1954. It's been waiting for him. What are these guys thinking when they come back? Were they all asleep? Paint's still wet. We just missed him. Mines are the exact same size. Why is he painting them? REBECCA: Sandstone paint. Rubber tiles, oh, my God. Playground turf. They use it all over the city. So his next target... Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco. [CAMERA CLICKING] Whoever killed the security guard has gotta be the nutjob planting land mines. City gets a ransom note with some crazy Korean poem in it. Guy says give him $651,000 and change... ...he'll tell us where the rest of the mines are. - Pretty specific number. - Yeah. How is it that you caught up with this guy... ...but everybody else seems to be clueless? I got a secret weapon. Who are you, again? [PHONE DIALING] HAUSER [OVER PHONE]: Surprise me. We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs. - And Petty? - He left a dead security man in his wake. We found playground turf and paint. We don't know what the paint means. The turf... What color was the paint? The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park. We don't have enough information. There's too many of them. What color was the paint? - It was tan. Sandstone. - That's two different colors. - Look... - Listen, cross-reference your locations... - ... with the word "windward." - Excuse me? - Windward. - Why do you have to be cryptic? - What are you working on? - Stop. Listen. Windward. Pull up the list of parks, would you? And check for "windward." HAUSER: "Sunset." Sunset. Sandstone. DOC: There's only one Windward, park or school. Oh, man. Windward Elementary. That's close to my shop. I know those kids. Hey, Tanner. You bored of me yet? We've got a park to check out. MAN 1: Got nothing, we're all clear. - Damn it. MAN 2: The park's clear! Swept both playgrounds and the field. Park's clear. Looks like your intel was off. Anyplace that has this turf needs to be closed and searched. Yes, Mom. We're all over it. Watch your step out there. Yeah, you too, Tanner. Hauser was so sure of himself. He was more of ajerk than usual. You gonna rub it in? [PHONE RINGING] - Tell me that you're still at the park. - Oh, yeah, I am, but Petty's not. Stay there. He could still show up. Where the hell are you? Until you hear back from me, do not move. [GUN COCKS] Petty. You know me? A friend of mine did. Give me your hands. [MINE CLICKS] You probably won't wanna move now. Now give me your gun and your phone. DOC: I've never been on a stakeout before. This isn't a stakeout. It's a waste of time. Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here? Well, transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits. [DOC CHUCKLES] I just pictured him in a transparent suit. It's pretty gross. REBECCA: Drop the knife. Get on the ground, facedown. You with the guy in the suit? You are. Aren't you just a peach? [PETTY GRUNTS] [PHONE DIALING] [PHONE RINGING] There you go. Where is he? Tick, tick, tick. How about we cut the cop-to-psychopath chitchat... ...and you tell me what you want? - I want my bombs back. The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery? Your friend is dead. What do you want? I wanna know what happened to me. A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now. Next thing I know it's, what, 2012? And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb. Tell me how that's possible and I'll tell you anything you wanna know. Hey. Hey, don't walk away from me! All right, stay here and talk to him. About what? - About what happened. - I don't know what happened. You have, like, 50 theories. Just pick one. REBECCA: "Emerson Hauser." This was his case. DOC: I think it's a quantum thing. Imagine a water bug on the surface of a pond... ...and he sees this twig sticking out of the water. When it rains, the water level rises. He thinks the twig is moving, when in reality... ...the one dimension he's capable of perceiving is moving, not the twig. You don't know what happened, do you? - No. - Does anybody? Probably. Okay, Pine Street. Windward Elementary. Sunset. Where the hell is Sunset? Sandstone paint. Sand. Six hundred and fifty-one thousand dollars. That's what? Fifty-five years of back pay the government never gave you? They owe me. They stole my Star. They took my pension. Who are you? Wrote a book about Alcatraz... ...and pretty much everything in it is wrong. You write about me? - No. - Why not? I was there. I was important. The warden said so himself. Gave me the royal treatment, him and his lady headshrinker. There were no female doctors on Alcatraz. - Let's go. Both of you. - Where? Sunset Beach. The location of the land mines are hidden in the lyrics of the song. He painted the mines to blend in with the sand. That's where we'll find Hauser. Or what's left of him. They tell me you've broken the code, Dr. Sengupta. Yes. The words in each verse of Paxton Petty's lullaby... ...correspond to the locations of his bombs. "Snow" for the Union Square snow festival. "Beard" for Beard Beach. And "grace"... Was Grace Cathedral. Genius. There's a fourth verse. Which means there's a fourth bomb. - "Twin tree." What's that? DR. SENGUPTA: I don't know. But I'm sure the good men of the San Francisco police will. - I've already made a call on your behalf. - Excellent. Lives will be saved. Alcatraz proving itself to be, once again... ...the crown jewel of American penal sciences. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Milton, don't skulk out there like a common ferret. It wouldn't kill you to give a compliment to a colleague. Genius. DR. SENGUPTA: Doctor. I've been meaning to have a word with you about one of your patients. Tommy Madsen's medical records. There's no history of illness recorded. Illnesses come in many shapes and sizes. You of all people should know that. But why have a perfectly healthy man spend so much time in the infirmary? And what do you want with his blood? A word of advice, my dear. Don't overstep. DOC: Rebecca, there he is. Walk me to him. - Doc, stay here. Call Tanner. - You got it. Don't come any closer. Hauser, just hang on. We're gonna get you off that thing. No, you're not. Let me help you. Need anything? Water? A cigarette. You don't smoke. I should never have quit. - You don't need to be here. - I know. Just can't see from up there. So, uh, what I told you on the phone... ...did that help you catch him? Windward Elementary. So I was right. Yes. And just this once, I will apologize for doubting you. Not just because you're standing on a bomb. TANNER: About another minute down here. I found the lyrics to that song. The last 1960s bomb, the "twin tree" clue. You ever find the place? No. Have you been looking for it this whole time? I made a promise to a friend. Gotta grab something from my pack. I'll be right back. Madsen. When he tells you the bad news, just give it to me straight. - He modified it. I'm gonna improvise. - Modified it how? Not in a good way. Said he's a vet, right? Afghanistan? Maybe we crossed paths. I don't think so. I wonder what he saw out there. What made him like this. You get to the good part? You made it a loop. - What do you mean? Can we unloop it? - The detonator and booster... ...can't separate from the charge without triggering the fuse. I designed it special for hotshots like you. And me. Anything that's put together can be taken apart. And we ain't got nothing in common. We'll see. - Can you do this? - Yeah. He's a punk. I got this. All right, here's the plan. On three, you're stepping off that mine. You gotta do it cleanly and then get behind that blast wall. - I can do that. - He's going to need help. He's been standing here for hours. His legs are dead. I don't need you. Soon as he's off the plunger... ...I can find a backdoor to this thing and defuse the mine. Let's go. All right, on three, you're hauling ass. One, two, three. HAUSER: This way. Move, move, move. Over here, behind the barricade. Get down, get down. TANNER: All right. Gotta be steady, steady, steady. Now come to Daddy. All right, there you go. Got it. Tanner! MAN 1: Get in there now! MAN 2: We're coming, we're coming. MAN 1: Tanner, Tanner. MAN 2: Come on, buddy. Couple of things. You just killed a good man. And my legs hurt. [PETTY YELLING] We translated your song. We dug up every mine you planted. Not every one. Twin tree? That one went off 20 years ago. How many people went with it? Not a soul hurt. - You're lying. - Okay. I planted that mine on Mount Sutro right on the trail everyone took to the top. No, that land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine. No one's taken that trail in 50 years. Hauser. But thanks for telling me where to dig. [PETTY GROANING] A cigarette that bears A lipstick's traces An airline ticket To romantic places So have you found the twin tree? It's you. You're here. And so are you. Officer Hauser, the twin tree. Any leads? Um, not yet, but, uh, I'm working on it, day and night. Well, I'm here to help. In those shoes? Well, I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner. HAUSER: I found the twin tree. And Petty's last bomb. So much death from something so small. [MACHINE FLATLINING] [MACHINE BEEPING] You know her methods. Fix her. [English - US - SDH]
