 I got 'em. ...with parts of five separate coastal cities still in the dark tonight. Power and light officials for the three counties most affected... are still in the dark themselves... over exactly what's behind this unusual occurrence. When you're racing, you don't get to look around much. Little more than two hours. Where? They've locked us in. Who are they? They spoke Russian.

 Yeah. They spoke English, too, before they... Oh! They drugged us is what they did. Hey! - Shh. - Anybody out there? We're alive in here. The sub... what about the crew? Yeah. Where are they? - Where are we? - Hey! You'll come with us, please. - Who are you? - Where the hell are we? What right do you have to hold us here? Please. Military, government. Who else would have taken us off the sub like that? They spoke Russian. We were in a Russian sub. They probably thought we were Russian.

 What were they doing in the middle of the Atlantic? - Hey, take it easy. - Where do they come off abducting us? Excuse me, sweetheart, you want to tell us where we are... and who you are and why? Sweetheart? Bastards. You are Howard Gregory Thomas. I'd like to know where I am. You reside at 9703 Emerson Terrace? What were your parents' names? Uh, Ira... - Ira and Eleanor Latham. - Right. You were born in Skokie, Illinois. Correct? Is that correct? Yes, well, I was conceived in San Diego. You immigrated to the United States in 1998. How do you know that? Who's in charge here? 'Cause I'm guessing it's not you. Currently you're teaching and engaged in research... at the University of Florida. Where are we? Back on mainland? We're not aboard a ship, 'cause I cant feel any pitch. What the hell is this place? And who the hell are you? You are Dr. Emily Meredith Patterson? I never use Meredith. The only place you could know that is from my original birth certificate... and that's been sealed, but for my parents, and they're both dead. So how do you know that? How did this come to be in your possession? Considering what that is, maybe I should be asking you the questions. Considering it's counterfeit, I think not. And the submarine you were on? Well, it was, uh, it was a... a rental. A chartered whatever you call it. They were helping us with our research. - Research? - Yes. Research into what exactly? - Do you have a more comfortable chair? - Research into what? Who are you guys? Military, government, private sector? The reason I ask, you see, is I'm trying to figure out... who I'm going to sue the living crap out of for holding me against my will. We've I.D.'d them. Identities confirmed. Scientists. Their story checks out. The sub was a charter involved in some form of research for Benirall Shipping. And the sub crew? Receded. But their backgrounds, drugs, running illegals. They're not going to say a word. And these four? Quarantine them. If we keep them here, it will only exacerbate matters. We've kept them isolated. They're plenty intimated. Believe me. - One of them is a reporter. - For a small-time tabloid. He's manageable. They all are. We're less than fifty hours away, sir. That's why I want them out of here and handled. See to it personally. Anybody have a good lawyer? I mean a really, really good lawyer. We're underwater. What? I saw it. Some sort of huge control room. At this window, this giant window looking onto some... some mother of a superstructure, all underwater. - What do you mean superstructure? - I don't know. I saw it for a nanosecond, but it was big. Maybe it was another hallucination. No. This was no hallucination. Get off me! - Uh-oh. - Let go of me! Get your hands off me! Miami. We're back in Miami. This really isn't too much fun anymore. We should call what's-his-name... Benirall's kid. Ackerman? Who's got his number? Oh! They took my wallet, money. Oh, beautiful day. Got somebody to call for a ride? I been working deep ocean for seven months. I haven't exactly kept up with anyone. What about you? Me? Sure. Twenty people, more. Coworkers, students. Any one of them would be glad to collect me. What? Don't remember anybody's number. Not by heart, you know? Real close to them, huh? Give me that. Who are you calling? I'm, uh, calling my ex. It's about Daddy and me, huh? Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! No! No! No! No! No! Helen! So, what now? Look, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm done, finished. What about our money? So you're just going to ignore everything that we've experienced? Everything we've experienced is exactly why. What about what happened to that little girl? The money... what about the money? We're all exhausted. Why don't we get some sleep? We'll talk about this later. Hey. Thanks for coming. Well, this has got to be a fascinating story. Yeah. Do you, uh... Do you mind if we give my friends a ride? No. It's fine. Hey, Meeno. Olsen's coming in today to see a gorgeous paint job. The problem is you haven't finished the paint stage on the boat yet. You know I can't get the sprayers to work right. In fact, I can't get anything to work like it's supposed to. When you gonna get this piece of junk out of here? You know, I know you love working on it... but enough's enough, huh? Hey, you listening to me? Hey, Paloma, how's that boy of yours? Saw him at T-ball last weekend. Heh, got quite an arm on him for such a small fry. - Thanks, Tito. - Well? Uh, sorry... sprayers. Yes, I'm... I'm on it. Yeah, whatever. Yes, I know that's your official position, but I know there was a survivor. - There were no survivors. - Her first name is Heather. Sir, I'm telling you there were no survivors. Look, I am not trying to impede the investigation. - I really just want some infor... - Sir, there were no... - I just need to know that she's all right. - Sir, there were no survivors. Look, will you please stop saying there are no survivors? I know she survived it! I heard you, yes. It's a very different economy these days. Look, um... you're the headhunters who pursued me for my last position. You had, like, six companies that were clamoring for me. Your word. I remember. "Clamoring." Look, stop saying it's a different economy. I just... I just want... need some normalcy in my life right now. I just want a job, OK? Any job. Sort of a "What am I doing here? When the hell is the weekend"... Kind of job. Yeah. No, I understand. Yeah, I'll wait for your call. Sure, that's what I'll be doing. - Howard, where the hell have you been? - Marty... Howard, I've got a paper to put to bed here. You said you were taking a leave of absence. Calm down, Marty. Just listen. We're not gonna put up with this from you. I'm coming in with a story. - Whale of a story. Whale of a tale. - Yeah, right. Well, that's just what a great journalist I am, Marty. Yeah. It's a triangle story, but this one's different. It's, um... I got another call coming in. Look, I'll have it in by the final bell. - I've never missed a deadline. - Since last time. - Well, since then, but... - And the time before. OK, and then. Look, I'll get it in. I promise. Bye-bye. - Yeah? - Daddy? - Hey, kiddo. Look, I'm, uh... - Daddy, I don't know what to do. Look, I really can't talk right now. I'm sorry. Daddy's on a brutal deadline. What about your mother? Can she, um... - Oh, come on. Damn it. - Dad! What? What? What's the matter? Honey, what is it? I'm sleeping over at Mindy Granger's house. - It's Mindy's father. He's freaking out. - Slow down. - What do you mean, freaking out? - Daddy, I need you. Please. OK, OK, I'm coming to get you. I'll be right there. Oh, come off. What kind of administration crap is this? No one touches my stuff, damn it. Obituaries. Professor... Wow, you're in early this morning. What are you doing in my kitchen? How did you get in here? You know, Em, you shouldn't have left all these dishes for me. I know you've been busy at work, but... Well, what's the matter, honey? What do you want from me? Come on, Em. Do I know you? Oh, only since birth. I mean, that's kind of the way it works between mothers and daughters. - My mother's dead. - That's not funny, sweetheart. My adoptive mother is dead. My m... I never knew my... my birth... Adoptive mother? What... What on earth are you talking about? I'm your mother. Tracy! Tracy! Tracy! - Dad! - Honey, what's happened? Are you OK? You all right? Bill. You need to leave the house. You need to leave now. What is going on? I can feel it coming. - Please, I can't go through this again. - Daddy? - Get out of the house! - You're scaring the kids. You need to leave now. OK. OK. All right. All right. Girls, girls, go to the car. Go on. Wait in the car. I'll be right out, OK? Everything's gonna be fine. Easy, buddy. I... I can help. You... You can't! They started this. They started... started what? It's happening again. Bill... Get the hell away from me! OK! Just put the gun down, all right? Put the gun down. Whatever this is, we'll get you through it. No. No. What've... What've we done? Huh? Give me the gun. Just... or just put it down. Just set it down, OK? What've we done? Come on. Just... Just give me the gun. I'm so sorry. He shot himself? Well, he, uh... he kept... kept saying, "They've started it." And then he, uh... he just... he lost it. It was probably a drug overdose. It's not so weird. I don't think so. He, uh... Not... Not this guy. Well, we'll see. All right. Dylan. Keep you eye on the ball, OK? Here we go. In the mitt. Excellent. All right. Throw it back. Hit me. Excellent. OK, buddy. Here we go again. You watching? All right. Yes. A little more pepper on this one. Sorry, Daddy. That's OK, son. No big deal. Hey, what's this? Oops. Hello? Professor? Bruce? Do we have a phone book? Hello. Emily, listen. I know you wanted out of this whole thing... but I couldn't find anybody else's phone number. Something's happening... still happening. - I was wondering if... - Where do you want to meet? Did you get the story? It is not running, Howard. It's as simple as that. What do you mean, you're not going to run it? You've never refused to print anything I've... Your sources on these stories usually have at least some kind of credibility. - You don't even cite your sources. - What are you talking about? This is one of the best things I've written in years, and you know it. I am not running it. That is final. Anyway, for some reason, Kioshi himself wanted it killed. Some people came to see him. Ten minutes later, Kioshi is telling me to 86 any story of yours for a while. - Well, can I talk to him? What... - Kioshi? - Where is he? - He's gone. Judging by the look on his face, you're not going to talk him out of it, either. - What are you doing here? - It's Heather. - Oh, Stan. - Look, it's Heather. Will you get off it? With all that's going on right now, why are you obsessing about this? Because finding kids is what I do! Did. Look, I know that what I see isn't like it used to be. I'm wrong most of the time, I admit that, but Heather is important. Somehow she's important to all of this... to us. We're not even out there anymore, so why is it still happening to us? Maybe... Maybe we were exposed to something. I mean, people dump all kinds of crap out there. So your theory is that we were exposed to some brain-affecting toxins out at sea? - Well, that certainly makes me feel better. - At least I'm trying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I'm a smidge distracted at the moment. My adoptive parents didn't even know who she was. I always wanted to meet her. God, it's been such a hole in my life. Look, you said you never met her, you don't even know what she looks like. It's most likely a manifestation of your... It was her. It was her. Whatever these things are, they are not hallucinations. I... I mean, it's like we're seeing alternate... alternate... - Realities. - It's insane. I know. It all comes back to electromagnetic disruption. Our thoughts, our senses are entirely electro-chemical. Maybe somehow it's affected our perceptions. First name, Heather. Yep. And how are you able to get into the airline passenger list? We're a newspaper. Well, you're The Observer. You all right? Something wrong? You having another psychic moment? No. I can just look at you. A guy I know... killed himself this morning. Right... right in front of me. Almost in front of my kid. And it, uh... Yeah. Anyway, these people showed up at his house right away. Big, black cars. Took charge of everything, and... I swear that one of them was that woman from the facility. You think it was her, or you know it was her? It was her. We got something here. Flight 317, Wednesday morning. First name, Heather. Last name, Sheedy. Seat 31 B. Sheedy. Look. Senior discount fare. You see that? As in, she's old. Just like she was when we saw her on the ship. No, they changed it. See, they didn't want us to know that she got on the plane as a child. She was traveling with her parents. Look, check the seat assignments on either side. Seat 31 A... James Sheedy. 31 C... Allison Sheedy. Allison, see? They put their six-year-old daughter between them, like parents do. I'm telling you, no matter how old she is now... she was a child right up to the moment... that that plane went down in the Triangle. OK? Yeah, good. We'll meet you there. Bye-bye. Well, she's back in. I thought she quit. I did, too. Women. What about Bruce? We should call him. He's coming, too. He was there with her. Benirall Shipping. May I help you? - Your mother? - My birth mother. Hey, remember me? I saw myself dead. We have proof that the survivor of the 747 crash was a six-year-old child. Not exactly proof. Hey, Ackerman, we need to talk to him. Really? Uh... OK. Why? Because what's happening is now happening to us. - I'll see if he has a few minutes for you. - He has to. Why wouldn't he? A few days ago, he wanted us to bring him... everything we could as fast as possible. He's been in some sort of... I don't know. He's acting... Another one of our boats has gone missing. It's just a repair barge sent out to tend to a stalled tanker, but, still... Fourteen crew on board. Maybe that's it. I'll see. Hallucinations? Yes, but they aren't only hallucinations, not... not in the classic sense. What do you mean by that? Tell me exactly. They seem to be, um... Glimpses... of alternate realities. Alternate realities? There's something wrong with us. Ever since we went to the... to that region... When did you first start having these hallucinations? Tell me. When we dove on the 747. It's like something affected us out there. Maybe something, some discharge the plane was throwing off. We don't know what it was or... or how it's doing this to us... I sent you out there to get me answers. It's only been two days. Yes, but it's all escalating even faster than before. Listen. We've all seen some... some things, some events in the last couple days... that we cant explain, not yet anyway. But whether they have anything to do with the so-called Triangle or not... How could you possibly think they're not? Whether they do or not, I think it's time that you expanded our team... and maybe brought in some other people from other fields. No. No one else. No others. You four have to do this. Look, Mr. Benirall... I'm being pressured. The navy was here. The navy? They asked Mr. Benirall to call you off. They came to me, doors closed. They threatened me. Directly threatened our government contracts... indirectly threatened a lot more if we don't pull the plug. Why would the navy want to stop us? - We obviously struck a nerve. - That place out at sea. The underwater... whatever it is. They, uh, they captured us from the sub... and they took us to some high-tech facility. The navy could easily have done this. So what do we do now? Find me my answer. Thank you, Mr. Benirall. OK, everybody. Let's... Please. Time to go. Weston. OK. What is going on? It's simple. The government's trying to shut us down. - He looked worse off than we do. - You know, I have a friend. A friend of my kid's, really, who died today. Navy guy. And you remember that woman with the brown hair from the facility? She turned up at his house. Uh, people? What? Krupp. Who's Krupp? Benirall's gone completely around the bend. I... I don't think it's him. My visions are nothing like this. How is that we're all having the exact same hallucinations? It's not a hallucination. Why the hell Nazis? Something. Communism, fascism. America could have taken a radical turn at several points in its history. This isn't all that outlandish. Uh... Stop! You've been ordered to stop! Sorry. Uh... How can we help you, officer? Officer? You can help me by stopping when I ask you in the first place. Listen, mate, we don't need to make a federal case out of this. You're Australian? Don't move! - Uh, son, just calm down, now. Just... - Don't move! I said don't move, old man! Excuse us. I say we go to Benirall, and we make him get us help. He's obviously being affected by this pretty badly. - This isn't just about his missing ships. - Oh, listen, mate... I'm getting sick and tired of these stinky little hints you keep dropping us. There's something else. It's just... - Enough, damn it! - OK. You, Stan, if you've not got something concrete to give us... keep it to yourself. - You know, you are such a jerk. - At least that was concrete. We're not entirely without a direction to go. The navy keeps interfering with us. I think there's a connection there. This has something to do with the Triangle, with missing ships? - Our hallucinations? - I don't know, but it's a lead. Well, I'm with you. Last people we saw with Heather were the Coast Guard. I say we work with the signs. Everything we're experiencing has to have an empirical explanation. - If we rule out everything that's not... - Whatever's left must be right. We can work at my lab. - So... - So we're doing this... before the dinosaurs come back. Hey, boy. Hey, boy. Hey. Hey, how you doing? Yeah, yeah. - Hey! - Hi. - You get what you needed? - Yeah. What's this? You think he'll like it? I don't know. It's a little young for him, don't you think? He's almost eleven. Oh, no. No. This is for Ruben. This is for Dylan. Who's Dylan? What were you expecting to see in here, Meeno? Meeno. We got onto it right after you called, Dr. Geller. At first, the idea of seeking out an explanation... for the Bermuda Triangle seemed a bit odd. Even for you. And this is your explanation for hundreds of sinking ships? It's widely known, sir... that there are methane gas pockets trapped beneath the ocean floor. If a big enough undersea pocket were to escape... And all the planes that have disappeared? Professor? Zones of compression... areas where continental masses compress against each other... OK. Great work. Terrific. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you all. But, uh, we've got a new direction. We want to look at, uh... Well, we're thinking... Worm holes. I don't understand, Meeno. What's wrong? There's no hole in the screen door. Hole? Meeno... It's like he never existed. - Like who never existed? - Stop it! Why are you doing this to me, Helen? Why? I can't live with you like this. And I won't have you doing this to Ruben. Do whatever you need to do. But I want you back. I want us back. Find an answer to this... or I'm leaving you. I was... I was here this morning. This is nuts. What are you... What if this place is under surveillance? Relax. There was nobody out there. - What are you looking for? - I don't know. Something. I... I feel like he was a part of this. God. Getting very heavy, feeling oppressive. Yeah. This is where he died. - Oh, jeez. - Maybe there's something... - Where you going? - That'll help us. Where you going here? Man. Is this a common, acceptable means of gathering information for you? Going through some dead guy's desk? In my line of business, you do what you got to do. Yeah. And write what you want to write. What's that supposed to mean? Well, I've seen the kind of stories you write. Look, I got a family to feed, OK? What do you know about that? You wrote about me once. Didn't remember that, did you? I wouldn't think you did. Whoa, whoa whoa. You're certainly more of a challenge... than the angry fifteen-year-olds I'm used to seeing. I've never, uh... seen a... a doctor, uh... a doctor like you. I've never even thought about it. Not when my parent's died a few months apart. Not when I got back from the Gulf. The navy offered it, but I, uh... Considering what you've been through... boat sinking, stranded alone at sea... no... no idea when you're going to be rescued, even if you'd be rescued. Of course, uh... Of course this is... This business with your son... So what could it be? Uh... some kind of break? Well, you'd think so, wouldn't you? A break is usually kind of across the board. You seem pretty functional. Loaded with attendant anxieties, naturally. You seem to be missing only isolated memories. That's what's got me stumped. I'm thinking... selective amnesia kind of deal. But that's incredibly rare. I'd have to do some research to be fully conversant on something like that. Even so, it's... it's a million-to-one shot. They all died. All of them. The boat was my responsibility. They put their lives in my hands. Seven people. They did. They just went under, and then... then they were just gone. What was I supposed to do? What could... What could I do? What could I do? Meeno. I just talked to Helen. You've got to stop beating yourself up about this. You're acting crazy. It's not our fault that we survived. We did everything that we could. Meeno? You OK? You should sleep. Heh. You're not. Oh, I don't sleep. Not much anyway. What about them? They're new. The bunch from last night went home around 4:00. Didn't you notice? - I was concentrating. - Obviously. Take a look at this. What am I looking at? This is geoelectromagnetic data... streaming off an old Canstar satellite over the Atlantic. These numbers are indicative of a major, major weather event. Massive. A category five hurricane. Over the Atlantic, now? That's what it says. This is a nautical weather broadcast from San Juan... based on area radar, sky bird photos, ships' radio traffic. Look. Look at what? It's blue skies and calm seas in every direction. It's a beautiful day. OK, so your data is wrong. What does this have to do with worm holes? I don't know, but I've checked it five times. - There's something going on out there. - Wouldn't other people... the U.S. Weather Bureau, whoever, be seeing it, too? Not if they're not looking for it. An invisible storm. So, I saw you grab something. What are they? Top-secret stuff or what? If he'd kept any of those at his house... the men in black would've cleaned him out yesterday. These, they didn't care about. We do? What are these, credit card receipts? These are for Bertha's Restaurant. There. These are from Beijin's Dry Cleaners. So, you think Granger visited here a lot. According to these receipts, every other day for the last five weeks. Hmm. You think maybe he worked somewhere around here? A navy base. Thought you said he worked out at sea. Well, maybe they reassigned him. Or maybe he was working out there, and they brought him here... to help him, fix him or something. Hey, don't work too hard. I'm thinking. This is what I do when I think. Hmm. Why the ocean? What? Why build this huge facility in the middle of the Atlantic? We don't know it was in the middle. We know generally where we were when the sub got stuck. The only reason they'd capture and question us is if we came too close. But why the ocean? Why the Triangle? There's got to be a good reason. What's in the ocean? - Water. - No, not just any water... seawater. What is the foundation of everything we've been talking about? Electromagnetism. All water has resistance. Seawater has lower resistance than fresh. But that resistance is cumulative per unit of volume of water. You're losing me. Look, if you were trying to generate... an enormous amount of electromagnetic power... you would want to be sitting in the middle of a huge puddle of seawater. And one of the side effects would be haloclines... lots of them. But an electromagnetic storm? Why would they need all that power? Mr. Thomas. The base information officer will be with you shortly. I took the liberty of checking the navy personnel records... for an individual named Granger. Granger, William. It's a common enough name. We actually have two of them on active duty. A C.P.O. serving aboard an escort destroyer in the North Pacific... and a dental tech stationed in the Azores. - Could he be classified as retired? - That's all our records showed. Anyway, as I said, if you're still interested... an information officer will be happy to speak with you. I'm still interested. Mr. Thomas, wait in here, please. - Thanks. - What happened to your friend, sir? Bathroom. He, uh, ate some bad shellfish. I'll send him in. No! Let me go! Come on, let me go! Let me go! No! No! Let me go! Sorry to keep you waiting. It's Mr. Thomas, is that correct? We've met before. Who are you? You're not permitted in here. Please, sit down. Yeah, I saw Heather. They have her here. She's locked up. You're talking about our elderly guest in the infirmary? Heather Sheedy. She survived the plane crash. - Why do you have her hidden away here? - She's not hidden away. Well, she has family. Why isn't her family here? She has a grandfather. At her age? I doubt that very much. I saw her. I saw her. I think we're finished here. Stan! Stan! We've got to find her grandfather. Already looked for relatives. Phone books, school records, public records. There's nobody. And even if there is a grandfather, ten-to-one the navy's already got him. I don't think they have. Oh, well, then maybe he's wearing his super magic invisible cloaking device... because no one can find him. I can. Well, that much energy has to be man-made. It can't be a natural phenomena. - Entropy. - Exactly. The natural tendency for energies to decrease, not increase. And that energy is building in the Atlantic, so it has to be created by something. The problem is there's nothing mankind could build... even in theory, that could generate that kind... How do you know that? The government keep you abreast... of everything they're doing? - It's just not possible! - But something's going on. I've got hurricane-level electromagnetic readings centered 320 miles offshore. Except there's no damn storm! I'm going out there. - What, in a boat? - A plane. Oh, better. Because it's better to be flying while all this is going on. - Come with me. - Please! We have an opportunity to observe a manifestation... of something that's going on out there while it's happening. We're looking for an answer. The answer's out there. And you've got a death wish. Stan? You OK? The, uh, images that I see... always come randomly. They're always unclear. Uh-huh? There's only one way I know to actively bid the images to me. You want to give me a clue here? Just wait outside. Keep the door closed. And, uh, give me twenty-five minutes. Just twenty-five. And then come back in... and wake me any way you can. - Come on, this is kind of... - Just go! No. Don was there. Attention, whalers! You are in violation... He... He died with the others! Brace yourselves! I saw him drown. Hang on! Take my hand, Don! Meeno! You definitely know how to fly a plane, right? What, you've asked me four or five times already? You just seem like the kind of guy... who takes a couple lessons in something, and you know... - then loses interest, and... - I've been flying since I was sixteen. - Look, I'm flying. - No, you're taxiing... and we are about to fly way out over the ocean. WS 11 Alpha, req... Oops. Not good. Tower, WS Alpha 11 requesting clearance for takeoff. That was a joke. You know, a joke? Heh! Joke? WS 11 Alpha, you are clear to runway 29er south. How's the weather look out there? Visibility, 50 plus. Clear as spring water. Stan? This is the only way you could've done this? - It's called auto writing. - I know what auto writing is, but... I can't be conscious when I do it. I've tried holding the paper, but my hand just pushes right over the page. - This is the only way I've been able... - Give me that. It all looks like nonsense, though. None of it... I can't control what comes through. It just flows. I don't have any idea where it comes from. It's just if... if I enter into a state with... some specific information that I want or need... Hold on a second. I think I got a name. Carl. Carl. I'm going to get some water. Carl Sheedy. Well, you think it looks like "Sheedy." I think it looks more like "she pig." Someplace else it says, uh, highway one. Mile marker forty-seven. You couldn't come up with an actual address? Or a phone number, maybe? If this is where he lives, it's no wonder the navy couldn't find him. Hello? Excuse us. Ma'am? Who are you? What do you want? It's OK. We're not here to harm you. Heather. Who are you men? What do you want here? We're very sorry to disturb you. We're actually looking for a man named Carl Sheedy. You're her grandmother, aren't you? You look just like her. How do you know her? Fellas? They... They say they're here about Heather. What about her? Who are you? Are you with the project? I... I assume this isn't regular turbulence? You assume correctly. We're being buffeted by weather. Where are you going? Don't worry. Autopilot's got it. So, uh, why hasn't anyone else reported this phenomena? I mean, uh... others have to have flown through it or sailed it... Not necessarily. Right now, it's a relatively small cell... in the middle of a very, very big ocean. What is this crap? Some of it's standard, off-the-shelf weather monitoring stuff... but this and those over there, those are my own creations. - Ah, you built these? - Just part of my genius. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh, what? We're still forty miles from the center of the cell? How powerful is this thing? You keep saying cell, except there... there is no weather cell. - Look out there. - Look in here! There, uh... There was a plane crash. And, uh, your granddaughter was the only survivor. Oh, my God! Our son, Heather's father, and his wife? I'm very sorry. I tried to warn them. Tried to get 'em to join us here. You said Heather is where? There's, um, there's something else. Heather survived the plane crash, but... she's changed. Did you work out there? Not only worked out there. I, sir, am responsible for it. There were two of us. My partner's name was Ossoman, Victor. We were members of the physics department at Florida State. Undistinguished, neither of us tenured. Just teaching. Victor's brother-in-law worked laying deep ocean cable. South Atlantic. He called Victor one day. Seems whenever they'd hit a particular stretch of ocean... the cable would suddenly be sheared in two. But each time they recoiled the cable... it was somehow several hundred feet shorter. So, as a favor, Victor and I went out there. We discovered what was shearing the cable. Oh, boy, did we discover it. Exotic matter. You, uh, you discovered exotic matter? A window onto it, yes. What's exotic matter? Some sort of super matter. It's what U.F.O. Kooks theorize that Martians make their ships out of. It's a truly phenomenal power source. Victor and I went back to the school. Spent sixteen months worrying the data, fought like cats and dogs. Oh, God, Victor could be such an ass. Anyway, we were just about to publish, when the navy showed up. Someone there had gotten wind of what we were about to reveal to the world. They prevailed upon us not to publish. Instead, Victor went to work for them. - You didn't? - No. So how'd you end up way out here? I mean, why did... Because of what I suspect is coming. I'm a coward. You should be about done. We didn't stop for lunch today. I think it's time we get back. - We have to do this. - Do what? Collect full data. We'll need it. - Did you see that? - Come on. I think it's time we headed back in. If you insist. Victor and I started out just trying to discover something. To prove something that the world only knew as a theory. But the navy, oh, no, no. They wanted it to have a function. They wanted something that they could use. It was all just a theory! What do you mean, something they could use? What? Use for what? They're the navy, the military. What do you think they'd want to use it for? So, doctor, what's going to happen now? What are you and your wife hiding from? I'm not certain. Maybe nothing. Maybe... If it comes, it will be, I expect... electromagnetic in nature. At least to begin, but it won't stop there. Electromagnetism is the force underlying all matter, all space, all time. We, humanity, exist only by a quite remarkable courtesy. Even the slightest upset in any number of basic laws... or fundamental constants, and all of this could all just cease to be. You're... overstating, exaggerating. You have to be. Everything you've described to me, including what happened to Heather... it all fits. Victor and those with him are playing chicken with all creation. They could win, or... Listen, doctor, your granddaughter is alive. She is scared beyond words. She's surrounded by strangers. Now, don't you want to be there with her now? Come back with us, please. Please. Why isn't it getting any better? It seems to be getting worse! The farther we get from the cell, the energy should dissipate. Should, but entropy doesn't want to apply out here, remember? We can... We can outrun this thing though, right? Right? Hello. Let me talk to Dr. Bruce Geller, please. How about Dr. Patterson? No. No, no message. Well, yeah, yeah. I'll leave a message. Please tell him that Howard Thomas called. Yeah, I'm coming in... and I'm bringing with me a man who may have some information. Hold on. You're breaking up. Hello? Yeah, tell him we should be there in about three hours. Three hou... Hello? My God, what is that? What's happening? Howard... - Get us out of this! - I'm trying! Warning. Warning. Warning. Warning. Warning. Warning. Stan! Stan!
