 That's it! I win. - Old maid, you're the old maid. - I suppose I am. Poor Dad. Just an old spinster. Lonely me, lonely me. It's your own fault, you know? There were plenty of men who wanted to marry you, but you said no to them all. I did. You know, I think I'd rather be a spinster than a wife. Really? Why is that? I think a spinster has more independence.

 Edward, don't encourage her. I'm saying it implicates us, makes us a part of their disgusting system. I completely agree with you that it's disgusting. But what can we do? We can't have two separate countries with two separate systems of law. Of course not. That's why they need to wake up and make it illegal. What are you talking about? Another fugitive. Some southern fat cat, who probably owns 200 slaves, loses one and claims he's somewhere in Amherst. And if any of us happens to see the poor fellow and don't hunt him down and turn him over, then we get slapped with a fine. Or sent to prison. They call that a compromise? I won't do it.

 Good for you. It's horrible. We should be helping slaves escape. Not catching them and sending them back. That's absolutely right. Don't you agree, Dad? Unfortunately, our southern brethren have organized their society around it. So we need to have a certain amount of respect for their rules. That's the point I was making. Gross. You were? I always thought you were more of a radical, George. Look, I have relatives in the south. And they're not bad people. - They're just... - Stupid? - Backwards? - Old-fashioned. And what am I supposed to do? Just not talk to them anymore? No, you should talk to them. Talk to them about how their way of life is an abomination. Okay. Well, that'll make for a nice Thanksgiving dinner. All right. Good luck figuring all this out today. Hey... Mr. Dickinson... there's something I wanted to talk to you about. - What? - Fundraising stuff. - Well, what kind of fundraising? - For the new chapel. I can get into all the details... in private. All right. My office. George, don't forget, we have Shakespeare Club this afternoon. I know. Brought my copy of the collected plays, ready to go. And we can't spend the whole time fighting over - which play to read like we usually do. - I'm not the one who starts those fights. Because you always wanna do Hamlet. - Who doesn't wanna read Hamlet? - Me. Did Maggie get back from the post office yet? Maybe. Was there any mail? - Maggie? - Maggie? - Maggie, you're back. - Did you miss me, dearies? - Terribly. Was there any mail? - Yes, was there any mail for me? No mail for either of ya. Miss Sue ain't much of a correspondent. - She still hasn't written to me once. - She's written to me, though. Twice. Twice isn't that impressive. Look at the green-eyed monster over here. - Jealous? - "Green-eyed monster..." Hey! I know what play we should read today. Othello. - Why don't you ever wanna read Hamlet? - Come on, Othello is so much juicier. "O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on." Meat! Consarn it. I was supposed to pick up a ham. This isn't about fundraising, is it? No, sir, it's not. It's much more important than that. Well, out with it. Well, as you probably guessed... I'm here to ask for Emily's hand in marriage. All right. I see. Mr. Dickinson, I love your daughter. She is the most brilliant girl in all New England. And nothing could make me happier than to have her as my bride. And you and Emily have discussed this? Well, kind of. Well, I mean, she never actually said yes. We communicate on pheromones, pretty much. But I think she likes me. And I know I'd be a great husband for her. I'm gonna become a professor. We'll have a happy life together, we'll have children, and I'll always keep her safe. A professor, you say? - What department? - The English department, sir. I'm quite devoted to the English language. Were you the one who published her poem? Aren't you? Well... I wanted to make her happy. But, from what I've seen, you only seem to encourage her wildest impulses. A father worries, you know? Morning, Maggie. Henry, you finished raking those leaves already. Well, you can never really finish raking leaves. - Why's that? - Because God made too many of them. Exactly right. Well, then I suppose you can go to the blacksmith's now to collect the horseshoes. The thing is, the blacksmith, he's on Main Street, right in the middle of town. That's right. What's the matter? Well, see, I've been trying to keep myself away from town for a while. Henry, did you get yourself in trouble with a woman? He can't go into town because of the fugitive. - Right, Henry? - I'm afraid so. Those thugs are dangerous. They could try to kidnap you. I wouldn't put it past them. But you're a free man, aren't you? You got your papers and everything. Papers don't mean much to these folk. There's a big reward, you know? And papers can be torn up. It's ridiculous. And they say that we don't respect the law. It's horrible. They break families apart, they tear children away from their mothers... Is there anything you need around the house? I could do something like that today and go over to the blacksmith's tomorrow. I'll go to the blacksmith's. No, you don't have to do that. I don't mind at all. You stay right here. - Be back in time for Shakespeare Club. - "Exit, pursued by a bear." - Sorry to cause all this fuss. - Don't worry about it. I'm sure there are chores to do around the house. There are always chores. Well, the piano needs tuning. - But I don't suppose you could do that... - I can. I've tuned it before. Have you, now? - Henry is a musician. - Really? Yes. He's a man of many talents. But you might say pianos are... my forte. That's a good one. Oh, my God. Henry, have you ever done any acting? Not that I can recall. Well, this could be your big chance. We're reading Shakespeare today. Othello. You could play the lead. I don't think so. But you'd be so perfect. And you love Shakespeare, I know you do. Miss Emily, do you really think your father would approve? As a matter of fact, my father is very progressive when it comes to Shakespeare. It may surprise you, but he even approves of women reading parts. And the plays are so much better when you can actually cast the parts - as they're meant to be played. - If you don't mind, I think we'd better not. Your mail, Susan. Thank you, Mr. Keillor. How many times must I tell you? Call me James. You do get a lot of letters. So... the children are sleeping? That's a nice break for you. Well, let me know if... you need anything. Okay, everybody, today we are going to read Othello. Wait. I thought we were doing Taming of the Shrew. Come on, Taming of the Shrew? That's just a dumb story about a girl who wants to get married but has to wait till her sister gets married off first. It's not even interesting. Yeah, who could possibly relate to that? Let's not waste time on comedies. Tragedy, my friends. We must confront life's darkness. We must stare into the abyss. Abyss. Are you sure your father will approve? What? Why are you bringing him up? It's just that I've read Othello, and parts of it are kind of inappropriate. There's nothing inappropriate about Shakespeare. And my father says I can read any play I want. He has problems with other books, but not Shakespeare. At the very least, maybe Austin and I could go through the script beforehand and cross out anything that might be controversial. Great, that way we can pay extra attention to those parts. Who put the stick up your ass today, George? I'm just trying to be responsible. Not everyone agrees that Shakespeare is suitable for... For who? For... young ladies. George, you are being so lame. This is my Shakespeare Club, and I say we're doing Othello. Let's let Austin decide. - I'm fine with Othello. - Great. As long as I can pick my own part. You wanna play the lead? No. I wanna play Desdemona. That's a woman's part. A character, to me, is a soul. And the soul of Desdemona is one that I relate to deeply. Her love for Othello is so... true. So pure. Just like my love for Sue. - God. - I thought Emily should be Desdemona. Why? She's just... a fair maiden. Then I should do it. Sorry, called it. Emily, last week you said only women should play the women's parts. You said we had to make up for all the years where women were forbidden from being onstage. You made a whole long speech about it. If Austin feels a true respect for the character, then he can do it. Besides, I don't wanna be Desdemona. I'm playing Iago. The villain? He's also, kind of, the star. Okay! Reading starts in ten minutes. And, ladies... one of you needs to lend me a dress. Okay, so, in this scene, Iago and Rodrigo have come to tell Brabantio that his daughter, Desdemona... have eloped with the Moor, Othello. I would never elope. I want a big wedding. Right, let's just read. Here, I'm Iago. "Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! thieves! thieves!" Look to your house, your daughter and your bags! "Thieves! thieves!" "Brabantio appears above, at a window." Joseph. You're Brabantio. What? Hang on. Okay... Here we go. "Yo, what is the reason of this terrible summons? What is the matter here?" "Signior, is all your family within?" "Are your doors locked?" "Why, wherefore ask you this?" "'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame." Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; Even now, now, very now, "an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe." See, that's inappropriate. - It's straight-up gross. - Shakespeare nasty. Joseph, read. Yeah. "What profane wretch art thou?" "I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are making the beast with two backs." Wait. What does that even mean? I'll explain it to you later. No, you don't have to. Why are you being so cold? You're the one who ignored me when I saw you in town with that girl. - What girl? - Eliza Coleman. Oh, no, nothing's going on there. Really? I'm not making any beast with Eliza, I'll tell you that. - We should have done a different play. - All right? Here you go, some treats for the traveling band of players. Thank you, Maggie. What a lovely gown you have, Austin. I'm sorry, but, just as a general thing, while I'm in costume, can everyone please call me by my character's name? It's kind of crucial to my process. I noticed that George asked to speak with you alone this morning. That's very observant of you, Mrs. Dickinson. Well, what was he asking about? What do you think? He proposed. - He did? - Dammit. You nicked me! I apologize, Edward. But, my goodness. This is exciting. Is it? You said yes, didn't you? I told him I'd think about it. What is there to think about? He's an ideal husband. And it's not as if there are so many others clamoring for her. Calm your feathers, woman. I haven't made my decision yet. There is no decision to make, Edward. You just let him have her. It's not up to you. You'll never let her go, will you? What? It's like you wanna marry her yourself. "O my fair warrior!" "My dear Othello!" "It gives me wonder great as my content." To see you here before me. O my soul's joy! If after every tempest come such calms, "May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!" Whoa. Dude is going for it. Excuse me. He is my wife. Does there really need to be that much kissing? Says right here he kisses her. I feel like we're somehow missing the essence here. Can you be more specific? It just... It doesn't make sense, you in the part. And aside from everything else, Othello is black. Wait, what? He's black. Othello. The Moor. - The main character? - Yes, Jane. Othello. He's black. I disagree. What? You can't disagree. It's a fact. Like... what? Have you been... Have you been paying any attention at all? No. Okay, instead of noting me to death, could you just read your next line? I'm sorry, I just can't do this scene when I'm so distracted by how wrong you are for the part. You know what, Emily? You are on a total power trip. Excuse me? I think the only reason you like to do Shakespeare Club is so you can boss all of us around. - I agree. - Actually... I do this because Shakespeare is the greatest poet who ever lived. And you can't hear his poetry when it's being spoken by people who don't even listen to the words. What? Beg your pardon. I just came to tune the piano. Henry. Oh, my God. Henry, you couldn't have shown up at a better time. You sure? I can come back when you all are finished. No. No, forget about the piano. We need you to act. I told you I can't. You can. You have to. Because I'm not gonna be able to really understand this play unless you do. Besides, it's a great excuse for you to stay indoors. - Well, let me take a look. - Okay. Othello's monologue. Right there. Excuse me, are you giving him my part? - You can be one of the guards. - She's out of control. Totally. We should have done Merchant of Venice. Shouldn't you give him your hat? When you're ready, Henry. "To say my wife is fair," feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well; Where virtue is, these are more virtuous. Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago; I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; And on the proof, there is no more but this- "Away at once with love or jealousy!" That was perfect. Emily... I don't think this is a good idea. What are you talking about? It just... It just isn't proper. And I seriously don't think your father will approve. Why are you so obsessed with my father all of a sudden? Because we're in his house and this kind of thing just isn't done. George, you're embarrassing me. I'm sorry, but I just know this is wrong. Austin, back me up here. I... I'm not able to discuss this right now. - I'm in character. - Come on. It's just obvious. A man of... his kind shouldn't be in here acting with us. George, get out of here. - Excuse me? - I said leave! He forgot his book. This Shakespeare Club has too much drama. Let's go. How could you do that, George? You just ruined everything. I was only thinking of you, Emily. It's a dangerous world, and I'm trying to take care of you. I don't need you to take care of me. But I wanna take care of you. Don't you get it? That's why. Why? "That's why" what? That's why... I asked your father this morning if I could marry you. - You asked him? - Yes. And he's thinking about it. He's thinking about it. Okay. - Emily, I... - Stop. George. Just stop, okay? But... I love you. No, you don't. You can't. You don't even know me. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't. All this time we've spent together, I thought you were listening, but you weren't. And how can you say you know me if you don't even listen to me? If my voice just doesn't even register. It's not up to my father to decide my fate. And it's not up to you. - He has to give permission, doesn't he? - I don't belong to him, George. And I will never belong to you. You let him go. Where is everybody? They left. I'm sorry, Henry. Figure I'll just tune the piano. Life shouldn't be like this. What should it be like? You're sitting here... eating cakes and reading Shakespeare, trying to say this isn't what life should be like. But your life is easy, Emily Dickinson. You'll always have your father to keep you safe. "Afraid to own..." {\an8}I am afraid to own a Body - {\an8}I am afraid to own a Soul - {\an8}Profound - precarious Property -
