 It's time to go! You sure you brought enough for one night, now? Oh, Lord. You can never be too careful, Henry. All right. We'd better be off. No! No! You can't! You mustn't! How shall we cope with the unbearable pain of your absence? I know why you prefer poetry to acting. Goodbye. Goodbye, other child. All right. Must be off. Austin.

 The horses. - Come help with the horses, Austin! - Coming. I'm coming. Now, girls, keep everything tidy. There's cold roast for dinner. And please, keep Maggie away from the meat. If you aren't careful, she'll eat us out of house and home. Have fun in Boston, Mom. Girls... listen to me. While I'm gone, clean constantly. Au revoir, Mama. Bye. I miss them already. Vinnie, we have the whole house to ourselves for one night. To do whatever we want. Please don't tell me any ghost stories. I can't handle them. Austin, are you thinking what I'm thinking? I may be. - I'm gonna go ride my horse! - Let's throw a party! Wait, what? You guys, come on. It's been so long since Mom and Dad went anywhere. We need to throw one of our classic Dickinson house parties. - Yes! - I don't know. Come on. Lavinia, every time we throw a party, I find you with your hair tied around some boy's neck. That's actually a traditional courting ritual, so... Oh, my God. Can I invite Joseph Lyman? This is gonna be a disaster. Parties are supposed to be disasters, Austin. Parties are like shipwrecks. You should emerge from them soaking wet, out of breath, and helplessly disoriented. Come on, let's do it! Let's do what? Emily wants to have a party. That sounds fun. Yes, yes, it does. Let's invite everyone. Party at the Dickinsons' tonight! Yeah! - Okay. Hey ya. - Yeah! Beethoven. Intense. Think you might wanna lighten the mood a little bit? For the party? Hey, I liked that. May I speak with you for a moment? In private. You look so beautiful. Austin. Sue... darling. I was thinking. Don't you think tonight would be the perfect time for us to announce our engagement? I don't know if we're ready. What's your hesitation? I can't even afford to buy my own wedding dress. So what? I'll buy it. - No. - Whatever dress you want. No, you don't understand. I'm penniless. No inheritance. No dowry. I'm offering you nothing. Sue, you're offering me the most precious thing in the whole universe. - True love. - True love can't pay my debts. There are debts from my father's funeral and my mother's, and my sister... You don't need to give another thought to any of that. I'll pay whatever you owe. I'll take care of everything. A cousin of mine, she knows a family in Boston. They're looking for a governess. I could go work for them for a few months and earn a little money. In Boston? Don't be ridiculous. You're going to stay right here with the Dickinsons, and you and I are getting married. I'll get it! I'll get it! It's only George. Hey, everybody. Let's get this party commenced! Emily. I... - I brought you these. - George. - Lilies? - Yes. White lilies. Aren't they nice? They're the symbol of death. I love them. Can I get you some brandy? Heavens, yes. And did you bring my other gift? Yes. Yes, I did. George Gould, you're a star. Don't take too much, okay? Tonight is going to be wild! We're here. Where's Austin? He's here. Jane, I love your dress. Wait till you see her fan. My father brought it over from Japan. He's a samurai, so... Cool. Oh, thanks. Oh, my God. Joseph. You came. How are you? I made a pillow for my cat. Okay. Where's the brandy? There. Emily. You're here. It's my house. We've always been such good friends, haven't we? All those years together in school. So many memories. Right. Like the time you tried to poison me? I suppose if I marry Austin, you and I will be sisters. I suppose if Austin married a flesh-eating demon, she'd be my sister too. Anyway, it's very Jeffersonian. So Jeffersonian. - What's up, college! - Look. Everyone's favorite townie. Joseph Lyman. Yo, I run this town. I'm the mayor. Hey, thanks for the hookup. You really came through. Yeah, no doubt. Yo, check this out. Abigail, Harriet, Jenny, Fanny, Virginia. Gross. You keep five different girls' locks of hair in your wallet? Hell yeah! They're my trophies. I prefer to love just one woman. Why would you do that? Hello, boys. Nice fan. Thanks. Jane let me hold it. Apparently, if you go like this, it means, "I wish to get rid of you." Harsh. But... I didn't mean it like that. - Are you already drunk? - Don't tell me what to do. Has anyone seen Sue? Oh, there you are. - Let me pour it. - What is he doing with her? Who even is she? Her whole family is dead. She's a full-blown orphan. I mean, that's not her fault. You don't know that. Cool harp. Thanks. It's mine. You play the harp? I like to think it plays me. I think it's time. Just you and me alone, right? No. Everybody. Hey, everybody. We have a special treat tonight. Is it pound cake? Better. We got opium. Whatever. We have that in Japan. Oh, my God. She's so insane. Of course, she's insane. She's Emily Dickinson. Should I do opium? I'm planning to marry a minister. - Who wants a drop? - I do. Emily! Emily, that's too much. Here, take some. I can't. I'm in mourning. Sue, don't act like you're dead while you're still alive. Bee! I was hoping you'd come. What's up? How did you get inside? Girl, I flew through the window. Will you dance with me? Abiah? Yeah, Abby? Do you ever feel like Jane isn't nice to us? Do you ever think maybe we deserve more than what she's offering us as a friend? I mean like... shouldn't we all be equals? No. She is very pretty. She comes from an excellent pedigree. This is Jane Humphrey we're talking about. Without her, we wouldn't be invited to this party. Bee, you're so sweet. I'm covered in pollen, baby. May I have this dance? Bee, you don't mind, do you? This is a great party. Yeah. It really came together. Just think, if we were married, we could have parties like this all the time. George, you don't wanna marry me. That is, in fact, all I want. You should marry a normal girl, not a crazy lady. Maybe I like the crazy. Are you okay? No. My stomach. Jeez, I didn't know I was such a bad kisser. Austin, may I have this dance? No. I'm with S... It's okay, go for it. - No. - I'm gonna go find Emily. Wait, Sue. I... There's something I wanna say. Attention! Everyone! - I have an important announcement to make. - Austin, don't. The news is... my beloved Sue, this magical, mystifying beauty, has agreed to become my wife. We're engaged. Sue Gilbert is to become Sue Dickinson. Congratulations. Wonderful news! - When's the wedding? - We don't have an exact date yet. But soon. Very soon. Darling, when do you think that we should... I'm sorry, I have to go find Emily. Please. Please. No! No. Emily? Are you all right? Oh, Sue. Why are you in Lavinia's room? I got lost. And now I'm in this ribbon-infested hellscape. Are you dying? I hope so. You took too much of that stuff, I told you. Life is an endless sea of pain. Emily, what is wrong? I got my period. You know, Austin, I've liked you for a really long time. That's very flattering. My father says you're the most suitable boy in town for me. Okay. So, I guess I'm just... wondering, are you really sure about Sue? Yes. I am. But is she really suitable for you? Look, just because Sue doesn't have any money does not... I don't care that she's poor. I'm not talking about that. So, what are you trying to say? It's just... She's weird. What do you mean "weird"? She and your sister, Emily... Haven't you noticed the way they go around together? All I'm saying is, I would be afraid to marry someone who's... Who what? Who is in love with my sister. That's... ridiculous. Sue and Emily are old friends. Sue is a member of this family. Now, if you'll excuse me. Austin, wait... I just... Slow down there, buddy. Where... is my fiancée? I am going to play the harp. You have to keep your strings lubricated. Hey. You got a scratch. You don't want to mess up that pretty face. You think I'm pretty? Oh, yeah. You look hella ripe. - Get over here. - Oh, yes. Wild nights - Wild nights! Were I with thee Wild nights should be Our luxury! Futile - the winds - To a Heart in port - Done with the Compass - Done with the Chart! Rowing in Eden - Ah - the Sea! Might I but moor - tonight - In Thee! Just put something in there to soak it up. Like a napkin or something. All the napkins are downstairs. Here. Use this. I think she made this for her cat. Desperate times, girl. You really are my favorite person in the world. Emily... What the hell are you doing? I tell everyone we're getting married and you come upstairs to do... What exactly? With my sister? Austin, Sue was just helping me with a very personal situation. So you kissed her? In gratitude. - You have no right to intrude on us. - I have every right. She's my fiancée. Yeah? She's my best friend and you'll never understand the love we share. Ever! - Get off of her, you witch! - No! - She's mine! - Both of you, stop! - Just stop! - That's enough! I can't take this anymore. You're both too much. You're suffocating me. I can't breathe. Do you understand? I can't breathe. I'm leaving. I have to go. Wait... Where are you going? To Boston. - Boston? - No! Austin, no. Stop it! Sue, no! - Wait! Sue! Stop! - Stop! We can work it out!
