 It just doesn't make any sense. No, the Whigs have controlled this district for years. Never lost an election. How could this suddenly turn into a dogfight? The winds of change are blowing, I suppose. Winds? More like an earthquake. Like the whole country is just falling apart. No, I'm... So... have you cast your ballot already? I did. On my way here.

 Can the Whig party count on your support? I don't often vote a straight party line ticket. I'm more of an independent. Yes, well, I suppose it's good for a man to think for himself. I agree. Mrs. Dickinson, who would you be voting for? - If you could. - Me? What a funny question. I've never thought about it. Really? I thought you were a suffragette. How dare you insult me like that. - Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - It's so exciting. It's so exciting! - Oh, my God! Yes, it is exciting. - It's election day. Of course. - What? No, we're not talking about that.

 Who cares about an election when you can't even vote? {\an8}We are talking about... {\an8}-the circus! - The circus is coming to Amherst! Yes, it starts today! They're setting up the big tent now! - They've got lions... - Lions. And tigers and... Siamese twins. They've got Siamese twins. You know? You know Siamese twins. Can we go? Can we go? Can we go? The circus? How depraved. "Depraved"? What do you mean? Circuses are dens of depravity. They're vile and crude and utterly unsuitable for polite young ladies. No. Do you know there was a circus in Ohio where so much violence was incited, half the town was seriously injured and the other half went to jail. No, circuses are full of thieves and hucksters, gypsies... And how about those ladies though? Those so called "acrobats," scantily-clad, who will certainly be roaming about, flaunting themselves like common h... I'm not going to say it. No. Circus is no place for you girls. So will you take us? - Ithamar, we need to talk. - Yes, that's why I'm here. Well, let's take a little walk. Perambulate with me. - It's close. - I know it's close. - You don't have to tell me it's close. - It wasn't supposed to be close. No, I know it wasn't. The Democrats barely put up a fight. Your hat, sir. You left it in the carriage. Thank you. I love this hat. Right, but it's not the Democrats. - It's the Know-Nothings. - The what now? The Know-Nothings. You don't know about the Know-Nothings? No, I know everything about the Know-Nothings. - Okay then. - Well, how about you give me a refresher? So you don't know. There's just too many parties to keep track of. Why can't there be two? On the other hand, maybe you do know and you're saying you don't because when a member of the Know-Nothings is asked about their movement, they're supposed to say they know nothing. - Confusing. - Yes. So I could be asking you about it right now and you could be saying you know nothing, and that could actually be your way of telling me you're secretly a member of the party. Well, let's just assume for a moment that I'm not. - Tell me why I'm not a shoo-in. - Because these Know-Nothings? It turns out they know something about winning. They might win! Great scones. Did you know the scone was invented in the 16th century? - I'm sorry, did you say they might win? - Yes. - As in beat me? - Yes, Edward, I'm afraid so. But that's impossible. This is Massachusetts. The Whig candidate has won this district since the founding of the republic. Yes, well, times change. Mr. Dickinson! - What should we have for dinner tonight? - I don't care, woman. Surprise me. Well, how would you feel about woodcock? Or game hen? Or snipe, pheasant, plovers, grouse, roasted hare, or haunch of venison? Is there any way for me to get out of this conversation? The Know-Nothings have built a platform on populist economic rhetoric and anti-immigrant nativist anxiety. - It's a heady brew. - And noxious. Yes, but it's working. And you mean people are actually voting for these clowns? Indeed. It turns out people like it when you tell them who to blame for their problems. - And the Know-Nothings are blaming... - Immigrants, Roman Catholics, the Irish... - And we're not blaming anyone. - Exactly. We haven't picked an enemy. - That seems like an oversight. - In retrospect, yes. So after all this, I still might lose? - I don't know. It's close. - Close? God dammit. If it's gonna be close then let it be. Do you know what, Ithamar? I believe in this country and I believe in the good guys. That at the end of the day, the good guys win because we love America. And when immigrants come here to join us, we throw our arms wide open and we say, "Welcome. Grab a seat. Eat a hot dog." We don't kick people out. No. And as far as these Know-Nothings go, it sounds to me like what they need to know something about is a little thing called patriotism. And generosity. And pride. God, Maggie, what's wrong? It's me brothers. They were casting their votes at the polls this morning when they were attacked. One of 'em was beaten half to death. Beaten by whom? The Know-Nothings! They hate us for being Irish. You see, Edward? Things are getting out of hand. You know, Mr. Dickinson, me brothers and I, we came to America to escape persecution. "The land of the free," they told us. But it's the same here as it was in Ireland. Maybe we should just go back home. Maggie, don't lose faith in this nation just yet. You'll see. Honor and decency will prevail. Soon, I'll be elected and I'll represent you and your brothers. And I'll make sure something like this never happens again. I hope you're right. I know I'm right. Who cares if I never see an elephant? I saw a cloud that looked like an elephant once. I'm sorry your dad won't let you go. He doesn't let me to do anything. You may have noticed. Yeah, no reading, no swimming... And no circuses. So... what are you gonna do instead? - For fun, you mean? - Yes. How will Emily Dickinson entertain herself? I don't know. I might stick around the house. Maybe have a conversation with a moth. Well, here's something. What's that? Poetry contest. It says today is the deadline to enter. "We seek the undiscovered lyrical genius of Amherst." That's you. I mean, based on what I've read of yours, it could be. I know about the contest. You do? So have you entered already? Remember that conversation we were just having? About my father. Yeah. No reading, no swimming, no circuses, and no poetry. At least not in public. Do you really think that he would care if you entered a poetry contest? I guess you don't really know him yet. I guess not. My father says women who seek literary fame are no better than... well... let's just say, "acrobats." Well, that's a shame because... I think if you entered that contest, you would win. "Nobody knows this little Rose" There you are. God. I've looked everywhere. Hey, Em. What are you doing here? I thought staring at gravestones was my thing. - We have a problem. - What is it? Somebody's buried in Sue's spot. {\an8}Who the cripes is Ichabod Beecher? {\an8}That's the Beecher baby. One of the Beecher babies, I should say. God, that poor family. So many babies. Every single one of them died. Well, why is this dead Beecher baby buried so close to our plot? I guess they lost so many babies they ran out of room. Well, that sucks, but I'm supposed to be buried right here and Sue, as my wife, should be buried next to me. Shouldn't she? Why don't you just move the baby? What? I can't move a dead baby. What would the Beechers say? Nothing. They haven't lived in Amherst for years. They all moved back to England. Plus that baby died 27 years ago. He's basically an adult now. That's true. Okay, so I've solved your problem. I need you to solve mine. What is it? The Springfield Republican is holding a poetry contest. - Today's the last day to enter it. - Well, you're not gonna enter, are you? - Of course not. Dad would kill me. - No, I know he would. Which is why I want you to enter it. My poem under your name. Me? - I can't do that, Em. - Why not? - Well, for one thing, it's dishonest. - Only half-dishonest. The "Dickinson" part will be true. Yeah, and then what? You'll be mad because you won't get the credit. I knew you'd say that. I've thought about this. I swear I won't get mad. I don't care who gets the credit, I only want the world to read my words. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm positive. Here. You have to hurry, the deadline is this afternoon. They'll print the winner in the paper tomorrow. It's not like really weird or anything is it? No. No. Look, if you win, you'll be proud. Austin, please do this for me. Okay. For you. You're the best. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. How psyched is Sue gonna be when I dig up this baby? You really know your way around a turkey. Yeah, well... since I was orphaned, I always had to do the cooking. You haven't had an easy life, have you? It's wonderful having you back. Since you returned from Boston. Thank you, Mrs. Dickinson. I'm happy you and Austin settled things and that we're gonna have a beautiful wedding. There's something I'd like to give you. An engagement gift. I can't... Mrs. Dickinson, you didn't have to. It's something my mother gave to me the day I left the Norcross farm and went off to marry Mr. Dickinson. It's been my companion all these years. Of course, I always thought I would give it to Emily on the day she married but, well, I think it would be best if I gave it to you. "The Frugal Housewife." Mrs. Dickinson, I don't know what to say. Call me mother. You'll be my daughter soon. And don't worry, I'll do my best not to die on you. Hey, Sue. Hello. What are you reading? Your mom gave it to me. You're really leaning into this whole housewife thing, aren't you? Eat shit, Emily. I thought it was Ithamar with the results. No, still no word. This was supposed to be wrapped up by now. Honey, why don't you just try to get some rest? Get a good night's sleep. - It's been a long day. - No. The news could be here any minute. Hey, can't those girls keep it down? It's just Jane Humphrey and a few others. - Lavinia invited them to stay the night. - Oh, my God, would you tell them to hush? Yes, of course. Yeah, I'm deep in contemplation of our national situation. I can't bear another moment of their inane chatter. I mean the whole Kansas-Nebraska Act was just a massive overreach on the part of the slave power. They actually tried to repeal the Missouri Compromise. Like, do they really think we're going to admit more slave states into the Union? The problem is they control the government. We have to build a coalition that can block their legislation. Jane, you're like, so woke. I know. If I was allowed to vote, I would vote Republican. Good for you. The Republicans are the only ones who explicitly stand against slavery. The true progressives. They're on the right side of history. I know. It's like, if you really want justice for all people in this country, you have to vote Republican. Definitely. Emily, you're not wearing a nightgown. I can't sleep. Too nervous about the election results? No. Do you really think the South will secede? No way. They don't have the guts. There are too many aligned interests at stake. It would be economically devastating for everyone. I don't know, guys. I think they might. And then we're gonna have a civil war. We're definitely gonna have a war. See? Even weirdo agrees with me. There's gonna be a war and a million men will die. And then a million snowflakes will fall on their graves. But how do you know? I know someone... who knows these things. Who? Death. Well, anyway, I wish I could vote. I know, right? Okay, now let's talk about boys. Okay, wait, which minister? - Emily, pass the, pass the salt. - No, no, no. - Maybe... No, it's okay. - I had a healthy portion on the road. What? But you said... Lavinia, you're wearing black silk mittens at breakfast? Of course I am. You know that's no longer considered genteel? It isn't? Well, it was never convenient. Has the paper arrived? Not yet, Dad. They're still counting the votes. Won't be long now. We're all rooting for you, Mr. Dickinson. That's very kind of you, Jane. You're going to abolish slavery, right? Dear God, I have a headache. That's a yes. Well, let me attempt to take everyone's minds off of politics for a moment. I have a very special surprise. Susan? My beloved, I have taken it upon myself to ensure that you and I spend no less than eternity by each other's side. - Okay, we all know you're getting married. - No, no, no. What I'm saying is that I'm digging up a dead baby so that you can be buried next to me. I beg your pardon, dear? No, it's all good, Mom. I've hired two gravediggers. They're gonna do it today. You know that Beecher baby? You know the one. Ichabod? He's in the spot next to mine and that's where Sue needs to go so that we can be together forever. In the afterlife. Is that legal? - Father, is it legal? - Of course it's legal. - Is it legal? - Shouldn't I know what's legal? I think it's legal. - The poor Beecher baby. - Dad, it's legal, right? - What? - Who names a baby "Ichabod"? - It's a family name, Jane. - Paper's here. Dammit. Still no results? This is absurd. What has happened to the Whigs? What has happened to this country? - We need radical change. - Radical. That's what I was talking about last night. - Me too. - Please don't talk politics at the table. Oh, my God, Austin, you won! I... What? You won the poetry contest. I did? - You entered a poetry contest? - Yeah. Let me see that. Wow. You're writing poetry? I have dabbled in poetry. "Nobody knows this little Rose" A poem by Austin Dickinson. "Nobody knows this little Rose" It might a pilgrim be Did I not take it from the ways And lift it up to thee Only a Bee will miss it Only a Butterfly Hastening from far journey On its breast to lie Only a Bird will wonder Only a Breeze will sigh Ah Little Rose How easy For such as thee... "To die!" That's really lovely. You wrote this? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I wrote it for Sue. - And you forgot to read the title. - Title? Yeah. I threw one on there. "To Mrs. Blank. With a Rose." Mrs. Blank. That's you. Well, congratulations, Austin. Thanks, Dad. This is a marked improvement from your last attempt. Excuse me, I feel sick. Well, I thought it was really lovely. And I don't like poems. So you entered the contest. Not exactly. You won. No, Austin won. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's not his fault either. He didn't choose to be born a man. Just like I didn't choose to be born a... freak. You are not a freak. Yes, I am. Well, then I am too. You? An unmarried man my age? Of course I am. Maybe we should run off and join the circus. Dad, you didn't knock. I don't need to knock. It seems like that's what doors are for but... your call. Do you take me for a fool, Emily? What? I said, "Do you take me for a fool?" No. Of course not. And yet you treat me like one. Your own father. The man who gives you everything. The food you eat. The very air you breathe. Dad, I don't know what you're... Don't lie to me! Austin did not write this poem! Yes, but nobody knows that. So now everyone's a fool? The whole world. - Everyone but you. - That's not what I'm saying. They will know, Emily. Nobody will believe your brother wrote this. And you dared do this on the most significant day of my career? On Election Day? Do you realize what you've cost me? What you've cost this family, Emily? My God, you bring me another public humiliation! It's not my fault. Of course it is. Who else's fault could it be? It's not my fault you didn't win the election! Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the big top! You ready, Emily? - Ready for what? - To go on, of course. They're all here to see you. You're the star of the show. Ben? Good luck out there tonight. - It's a huge crowd. - What are you doing here? I told you I was a freak. And now, ladies and gentlemen. The moment you have all been waiting for, the greatest freak of them all: a female poet. Oh, my God! Dickinson! Great news! You won! Did you hear what I said? - I won? - Yes. You're going to Washington. Congratulations, Edward. This is the happiest I've ever been. You pulled it off! A narrow victory. Yes. Well, let's have a glass of sherry! No, no, I've got to get home. But you should celebrate with your family. I won. - Have you now? - Yes. As I promised. The men of honor and decency have prevailed. Well... that's a relief. Emily? Emily! Emily. Sue? Yeah, it's me. What happened? I...
