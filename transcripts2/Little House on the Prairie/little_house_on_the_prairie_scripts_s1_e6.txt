 What are these, little miss, hmm? Ha ha ha! Now the trick is to set your mind to do two things at once, like rubbing your tummy in a circle and patting your head with your other hand. It takes some learning, but bright girls like you should be able to do it in no time at all. We can do it! Of course you can! So can Laura. Now, shall we try "aunt rhody" again? Yes.

 I don't like to sing about dying. It's sad. Woman: Nothing's so sad about dying. I think it's sad. Well, when you get as close to it as I am, 't'ain't sad. Just like finishing a book or a quilt or maybe a long trip down the river and then starting off somewhere else, maybe It'll be more fun than where you were before. Ha ha! How about "going to Boston"? Girls: Yeah. All right now.

You'd think we'd be more alike. Let loose on this a little bit, Amy. That's it. Now I can get it. There. Why would you and miss maddie be alike? Born 12 days apart under the same sign. Oh, I don't believe in that nonsense. "The soul of Patience," both of us, it says in the horology book. Patience? You? How else could I live under the same roof for 8 years with a Kentucky presbyterian? Well, just maybe it was miss maddie had the Patience. You put your finger on it. If you take your finger off it, I'll hang it up on the wall. Patience she has... And the grace to let us do this for her. What, she knows? Of course she does. She wasn't behind the door when the good lord parceled out suspicion. I thought it was a pretty good story we made up: Laura and Mary wanting to learn to play the autoharp. Come on now, Charles. She didn't bat an eye. Of course she didn't. The joy of it is letting us surprise her. Not bad, if I do say it myself. One more will do it. Yeah, that old fox. I must say, she's a fine actress. The pity of it is, it might be close to her last performance. I wrote that to Eliza. Her daughter. Hmm, all she has left, with her son-in-law Tom and her 4 grandchildren. Her boys were killed in the war. She's a fine woman, Eliza. But like most children, she thinks upon a parent as a permanent fixture, a feature of the landscape that always was and always will be, time without end... Like a mountain or a rock. Pretty girl. That isn't Eliza. That's me Bridget and her two brothers. Well, I know that. She's still a pretty girl. Takes after her mother. Ha ha! Get on with ya. Come in. Anybody home? Amy: Come in, doctor. Wipe your feet. Oops. For maddie. Picked it up at the post office. Well, it looks like a party brewing. She'll be 80 years old today. Wish her a happy birthday for me... Unless, of course, I'm invited, in which case I'll do it myself. You're invited. I'll be there. Oh, it's a surprise. I know. Maddie told me. Ha ha! Another letter from Eliza. "Can't make it... too busy... Sorry." Like always. Should I take it out to her? Oh, no. She'll know about it soon enough. Hey... leastways, we're having a party. She won't want it now. Amy: It's all for the best. They'll come on thanksgmng, and you'll be feeling better then. You'll be your old self for thanksgmng. You always perk up in the fall. We'll celebrate our birthdays together. I'll bake a cake for the two of us. You're 12 days older than I am, so you can blow out the candles. How will that be? Oh, children do have their own lives to live, you know. We lose sight of that. I remember when I was bringing up me own. Oh, such a time I had! I never gave a thought to me own mother. I remember pulling me Sean out of a saloon when he was... Oh, 22, no less. And Bridget... gosh! We had it out, the two of us. When she was 16, she... She brought home a young blond bucko from a St. Patrick's day dance. I didn't approve of the gleam in his eye, and I put an end to it then and there, and she didn't speak to me for a month. And Andy... Lord love him. He was a trial, that one. Lord knows where you went or what you're up to. Well, you can't eat your heart out over the young. The birds are out of the nest and on the wing and good riddance to them, and it's time you stopped thinking about Eliza and Terrance and... Maddie? Oh... Maddie. Reverend Alden: Lord... Be with us in this hour of sorrow, as we gather to mourn the passing of one who's touched all our lives, given without stint of her warmth and love and understanding, and asked nothing but we love her in return. A great and noble lady was maddie elder. On this occasion... Don't you want to get closer? I can mourn better down here. She can hear me wherever she is. What are they doing? They're saying good-bye. What good does it do when she can't hear them? Laura: Why didn't they come to her birthday? You can miss a birthday, and nobody says much, but you can't miss a funeral. Why not? That's just the way grownups are. Hmm... ought to be the other way around. A lot of things in life ought to be the other way around. We ought to have our funerals while we're still alive so's we could say good-bye to everybody. Oh, thank you, Charles. It might be kind of lonely around here for a few days. Why don't you come stay with us? Oh, now, don't worry about me. I've got a lot to do. You sure? Sure. At my age, you get used to losing a friend every now and then. Thanks for the thought. Mary: Dear father in heaven, we thank thee. Bless this food to our use and our hearts to thy service. Amen. Charles: Amen. Laura: Amen. I saw Amy Hearn at the mercantile today. How is she? Well, she insisted on settling up her bill as if she had some kind of premonition. She's got to have something to occupy her mind. It's not good for her being in that house by herself. I'll so see her. Me, too. One of you go tomorrow, the other go the next day. That way, she'll have two visits instead one. That's a good idea. Caroline: I made some pie crust cookies. Stop by with them on your way to school. If she wants to visit a little bit, don't be worried about being late for school. Maybe we can have her over for Sunday supper. Good. I like her. She talks to us like we're grownups. Because she hasn't seen you eat. Pa! Pa! Half-pint, what's the matter? Miss... Just take it easy. What is it? Miss Amy... She's sick. Run on to school. I'll get doc Baker. Ahh... Boy: Ahh. Mmm. Sore? Can't talk at all? Just ahh. It came on all of a sudden. When? Monday. Hmm. He had it before? It happens all the time. Hmm. Well, I think we have a serious case of 5 day Quincy. It comes on Monday, leaves on Friday. That's right, doctor. Oh, that's nasty. Keeps an eager young fellow like this out of school. Doc, miss Amy's sick. Bad? I don't know. Give the lad castor oil every 4 hours. Gotta go, ma. I'll be late for school. Hmm. You have pain, Amy? Mmm- where? In me arm. Bad? Water. Doggone it, Amy. I can't find anything wrong with you. Your temperature's normal. Your pulse isn't great, but it isn't bad either for a woman your age. Doc... charles... Promise me... Anything, Amy. Me funeral... Now, I don't want you to start talking like that, all right? You'll take care of it... The wake, the funeral? There's not going to be a wake or a funeral because you're not going to die. No blarney, doc. Not now. Promise me you'll wire my children: Sean, Bridget, Andy. I don't know if Andy's alive or dead, but try to find him. Promise me. I promise, Amy. And the wake... You'll get the priest from mankato... Charles? Anything you want. You promise. I promise. It's settled, then. The wake will be on Wednesday, on me birthday. That should be a fine day for the wake, don't you think? Amy, I never put a woman, much less an 80-year-old woman, over my knee, but you're coming close to being the first. Oh, come on, Dr. Baker. Surely you understand why... I surely don't understand. I don't understand either. I don't think it's funny, Amy. It wasn't meant to be funny. It was meant purely and simply to bring me children and me grandchildren to me for the first time in more years than I'd like to count. I saw the light when poor maddie passed over. Rest her soul. Amy Hearn, you're going to have to take your business elsewhere. I'm not going to be a part of this kind of... Deception! Charles? Amy, you can't be serious. I want to see me children and my grandchildren before I pass over... An altogether serious matter, Charles Ingalls, even if you don't think so. It's an idiotic convention of the grownup world that your loved ones only come to see you when you're dead instead of when you can... Oh, hold them and love them and talk to them. And I'm going to change that idiotic custom. Amy, you're not going to talk me into... Why not, pray tell? You're asking me to wire your children you're dead! But you'd wire them if I was dead, wouldn't you? Of course I would. Then why? Why would you please me ghost instead of me flesh and blood? Amy, it isn't that. In the name of heaven, what is it? You're like me children... A dutiful letter once or twice a year: "Do you have money, mother? Do you lack for anything? Is there anything you want?" And I write them back, "all I lack is you. When can you come and visit me?" And Andy marched off to war when he was 19, with a smile and a whistle and a last hug and a kiss. And in 15 years, I've not had a word from him. They'll come to me funeral because it's a sin not to. And they'll weep and say all the things I'll not be there to hear. And you, both of you, you're the same. You'd do for me corpse but not for me. Amy, I-.I.. Charles? Doc? It's settled, then. Notify the children and the priest at mankato, and, Charles, you take charge of the preparations. Now, come on, come on, come on, come on. Amy: There's plenty of money in the till, and I'll be here to advise you. There'll be BlackBerry wine, chicken and ham and potato salad, and a birthday cake with a candle on it. Now, you'd do well to get the wires off right away. The priest at mankato is new, I understand, but the parish will have the records of me children. Now, off with you. Remember, Charles, don't spare the expense: A first-class wake. Yes, ma'am. What do I say you died of? I'm 80 years old on Wednesday. Surely you can think of something. You what?! I told you, Caroline. Miss Amy's going to die on Monday, and I have to handle the wake. Charles, you're not serious. I know it's unusual. Unusual? Unusual's not the word. Why, it's... It's... Charles, will you stop that, please? This is out of the question. I want you to go over, and I want you to explain it to her. Caroline, I am not going to go over and tell an 80-year-old woman that I'm going back on my promise to her. I can't do that. All right, then, if you can't face her... Charles! I'll go and talk to her. Well, somebody has to. We simply can't let her go through with this... This... plan. Well, by now, she's probably thought better of the whole idea anyway. Ha ha! Mary? Mary. What? How long do you want to live to be? Oh, I don't know. Let me sleep. I want to live forever. Well, you can't. Who said? God. God never told you that. Will you go to sleep? That's what it's like. That's what what's like? Going to sleep. When you go to sleep, it's like you're dead. Good night. Was she very disappointed? No. How did you manage to do it? I'm baking the cake. Mark my words. Uh-huh. You know what free silver means. Inflation! All I know is, I'd rather have a silver dollar than a piece of paper. Get those big clodhoppers off of there. You know what the difference is? You got 100 silver dollars in your pocket, and you fall into a river, you drown. That is the only difference. Huh. Laura: Doc Baker? Oh, afternoon, Laura, Mary. How's miss Amy getting along? She ailing? Sort of. But she's going to get all better, isn't she, doctor? We... I mean, I surely hope so. Bye! Bye! Bye. That's a fine old lady. You know, I had a feeling that there was something wrong when... Excuse me, oleson. Got to be going. Hmm. Amy, just throw in a couple of extra... You know, whatchamacallits. You won't be staying long. It's all clear. I wonder how come we don't have wakes at our church. 'Cause it's fun, and if it's fun, it's sinful. Who says? You just get a feeling about it. Afternoon. Both: Afternoon. Lovely day. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm father gorman from mankato. I wonder if you could direct me to the Ingalls' place? Uh, if you please excuse me, I have to go. That's my sister Laura. She's shy. That's the girl. Amy: He was a caution, I'll tell you. That was Andy. The most exasperating, infuriating, excruciating child the lord ever made, and yet, he'd look at you with the devil in his eyes, and he'd have you in the palm of his hand. He could talk a serpent out of a tree, that one. Ha ha ha! And now, it's time for your nap. Sleepy-bye. Sleepy-bye. Sleepy-bye. Pa! Pa! Pa! The priest is here! Father gorman! Come back here. He's not due here till tomorrow. Well, he's here today. Stay back there with miss Amy. This is father gorman from mankato. Father, I'm Charles Ingalls. This is my wife Caroline. Hi. How are you? How do you do? Of course, you met Mary. My, all the good smells. We haven't had much experience giving a wake, but we're doing our best. Father, won't you make yourself more comfortable? I won't be staying long, Mrs. Ingalls. Just want to assure you that I am here and will do whatever's required of me. I haven't had much experience with wakes either. I'm very new at this, just recently out of the seminary. Hmm. I didn't know Mrs. Hearn, but... Rest her soul... But my predecessor, father Kelly, knew her very well. I understand she's a glorious woman. Oh, she... she was. I thought perhaps you might fill me in a little on Mrs. Hearn... Her life and friends here in walnut grove. It'll help me quite a bit with my eulogy. Uh, father, I... I really don't think I can. I think I can probably help you, father. Well, she came here a long time ago, I understand. Yes, a very long time ago. Really, a much longer time ago than we came here. And she and Mrs. Elder... Both of them widows? Yes, they both... They were both widows. Charles, I really don't think we can. Father... Oh, how are you? I'd like a word with you... Outside, where we can be private. Oh, certainly. Excuse me. Thank goodness she's finally come to her senses. I hope he won't be too angry coming all that way for nothing. Guess we won't need that. You might as well have the icing. They're coming back. Thank you. Thank you so much for telling me about her. It'll be an honor to attend a wake for such a magnificent woman. Oh, my thanks to you, too. You've been a great help. Well... see you at the wake. God love you, miss O'Hara. Charles: Miss o'ha... Miss O'Hara? Me maiden name. After all, it would be a sin to deceive a priest. Now, let's get on with it. The very least I could do is lend a hand with the wake. After all, I'm the deceased. Oh, my. Woman: Look at her. She's got her thumb in it. Ha ha! Well... Any sign of them? They're still at Dr. Baker's, changing their clothes. Pa says they'll be here any minute. All right. Now, let me know the minute they get here. Ok. I'll go watch out for them. Caroline: Good. Laura-. Well, ooh... Is that what I think it is? She's 80 today... Or she would have been. Well... Glorious woman, Mrs. Hearn. I wish I'd known her. But a, um, birthday cake at this kind of a... Her friend explained it. This is the way Mrs. Hearn would have wanted it: To think of this as not a wake, but as a birthday party. Well, still, I don't know if I understand. I can almost feel her presence in this room. I know what you mean, father. Excuse me a minute, please. Oh, um, uh... They'll be here any minute. Are the guests having a good time? They were all very fond of you. Oh. Well, it's time I joined me party. A strange look in her eye the last time I saw her. Insisted upon paying her bill before the first of the month. Hmm. Now, who could that be? Father gorman: Oh, an old friend, been close to Amy Hearn for a long time. They're here. Hanson: They're here! Woman: You mean Amy... Bridget! Bridget! Hanson, it's so good to see you. Oh, Ruth. Oh, my goodness. Amy would be so happy you could get here. Excuse us just a minute. Father gorman's over here. Thank you so much. Come, children. Oh, yes, how are you? This is Amy's daughter Bridget. Father gorman. I'm so happy. I'm so glad you could be here. I can see why you're proud of your grandchildren. That's Dennis, the big one, and Maureen, same as your daughter she'd be, and the little one's Freddy. Sean! Mr. Hearn, Mr. Hanson. Sean I know him since he was a little boy. He used to work for me. That's been a long time now, though. You want to come and work again tomorrow? If things keep going the way they are, I'll be back next week. Charles: Sean. I'll look for you. Sean, I'd like you to meet the father. Excuse me. Ja. I know him since he was little. Hanson: Doctor? You are all right? Yes. It's just a little warm. Charles: Father, I'd like you to meet Sean. That's father gorman. How are you? You have wakes in mankato? Not like this. Neither do we. Do you got a grandma? Back east in Wisconsin. Ever see her? Not for a long time. How long is this going to go on? It's up to her. Oh... mmm... hi. Nice evening. Sean: Flanagan... Flanagan's window. Across the street. No, no, no. That was Flynn. Flanagan was 3 doors down. Ah, yes. Ha! 35 cents to have it fixed. She thought it was Andy threw that baseball. He told her he did it. He took the blame. Knowing he wouldn't be punished. Ah, he had a way with her. And with me. He did it for me. He knew I didn't have that 35 cents. You weren't fooling me, Sean. I saw it all. Why is it, I wonder, that you never know what they mean to you until after they're gone? It's hard to believe we'll never see her again. Ha ha! "Wipe your feet, Sean." Ha! If there's one thing I'll remember about her, it's that. "Wipe your feet." She was telling me that till I was 30. I was nose-to-nose with her more than I like to remember. Ha ha! You were. The blond boy you brought home from the dance. Oh, I was ready to leave home! I thought the world had ended. Ha ha ha! When she got that set to her jaw, she was like Phil Sheridan leading a charge. Oh, for years I'd never admit it to her. The blond boy? She was right, so everlastingly right. I wasn't so sure myself. Well, I understand you were her doctor. Hmm? Um, you were her doctor, I understand? Oh, yes, father. Ah. Well, I trust she came to a peaceful end. Nothing about Amy Hearn was peaceful. Aw, Sean, it would be wonderful. I'd like it. You know, I'd put him to work, I'll tell you. I... Saints be praised. He's come home. Oh! Bridget? Andy! Oh! Oh! Oh, Andy. Andy! How long has it been? Too long. Too long! Oh, you... Ha ha! Here, let me look at you. Oh, you look so handsome! And you... what a fine figure of a woman you are. What a pity it is it took something like this to bring us together again. Amen to that! Miss O'Hara. Miss O'Hara, an old friend of Amy Hearn. Mother. Did he call her mother? What in the name of common sense? I'll get to you later. Let me deal with this one first. You miserable, ungrateful spalpeen, you! All these years I'm thinking you're dead, killed in the Indian wars or stone river or Shiloh. How could you do this to me, Andy? How could you forget your own mother? 15 years of hurt and worry, waiting for a letter from the war department, and not a move do you make until you think I'm dead and gone. And you, Sean. I'm supposed to forgive you, too, I suppose. Now, just a minute, Amy Hearn. You've got some explaining to do. How could you do it? How could you let them tell us you were dead? You had no right, mother! Rights? You talking about rights? Whose rights? I've got a right to see me own children and grandchildren. It comes before anything else, and you ask how I could do it. Well, it isn't hard when you've tried everything else, when you're so hungry for the sight and feel of your family you can't sleep at nights thinking of them. And when it comes to you, the one thing that'll bring them to you is your own wake... Well, it isn't hard to do at all, at all. Sean, I heard you say it. "Why is it," you said, "you have to wait until they're gone before you know what they mean to you?" Well, you mean everything to me, you 3. I'm 80 years old, and I don't have many birthdays left. Maybe... maybe not even one, and when you think of that, you're apt... You're apt to be foolish. Ma? Oh, Andy! Oh, ma! Oh, Andy, my dear boy. And Sean. Oh, mother, I'm so sorry. And Bridget! Oh, ma. Oh, ma! I heard what you said about the blond boy. Aye, it was a great relief to me. I wasn't at all sure. Oh! Oh, mother! Well, come on! You heard what everybody said. This is not a wake. It's a birthday party. I hope you find it in your heart, father, to forgive me for fooling you so. Well, it's a little irregular, but I think the bishop will understand. If you feel you must tell him. Doc, you got permission to dance with my wife.
