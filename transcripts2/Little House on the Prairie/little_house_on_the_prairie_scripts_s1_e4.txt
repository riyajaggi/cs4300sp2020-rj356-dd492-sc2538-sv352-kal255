 While in Mankato, Charles is surprised to find Isaiah Edwards, the mountain man befriended by the Ingalls family on their journey to Minnesota. The two men return to Walnut Grove together to find young Laura sick in bed and a worried Mr. Edwards promises to stay until she recovers. But Mr. Edwards' deep concern for Laura stems from a devastating personal loss and he cannot forgive the one he holds responsible. Will the Ingalls' friendship and a budding romance with postmistress Grace Snider help Mr. Edwards come to terms with his past or will he leave Walnut Grove for good?

 I'll make out the invoice and then get this stuff aboard for you. Fine. I'll be back in a little while and give you a hand loading up. I don't get to the big city too often. I want to pick up a little present for my wife. Man: Come on, step up and get your due. Come on, any two of you! Take on all of you! Come on! What are you waiting for? Come on. Come on. Edwards.

 Man: Come on. Grab a chair leg! He's crazy! Edwards? Edwards, it's me... Ingalls! Ingalls? Ingalls. Ingalls. My only friend. Come on. You're going to be all right. Come on. Oh! Enough. Enough. Uh-uh. One more time. I'd just as soon be drunk as drowned.

 Well, right now, I'd say you're about half and half. Oh. I don't suppose you have a hair of the dog aboard, do you? All right. All right. What was going on back there? Well, best I can remember is I was having a quiet drink or two. These fellas come in, and we had us some social words. Next thing I know, they was jumping all over me. When I walked in, it looked like the other way around. Oh, well, they got me riled. You're a long way from Kansas. What are you doing here? Oh, I don't know. Just passing through. Now you bring it up, what are you doing in mankato? Freighting. On my way back to plum creek. The way things are going for you here, I think you ought to come with me. Plum creek? Where's that? It's right near a little town called walnut grove. Never heard of it. Neither did we till we settled there. Say, the missis and the girls, everybody fine? Everybody's great. Fine. Say, you suppose they remember me? Well, they talk about you all the time, especially Laura. She remembers you promised to come see her. She remembered that? Mm-hmm. Well, it wouldn't do good to have that youngster thinking my word wasn't good as gold... Or better. Then you'll come? Yeah. If you'll help me get onto a wagon. You got a deal. Come on. Edwards: Oop, oop. Easy there, now. Oh, my goodness. Easy, now. All right. Last stop... walnut grove. Everybody out. Ooh! This is it? Yup, this is it. I don't see no saloon. Well, you don't see one 'cause there isn't one. Soon as we get this wagon unloaded, we can head on home. Everything go? Everything goes. - Oh! - Mrs. Snider. Good afternoon, Mr. Ingalls. Oh! Well, really! Well, maybe I ought to clean up some before I go out to see the family. No. They'll be happy to see you the way you are. Is your Laura still as feisty as she was? Feistier. Wait till you see her. Here you go, sweetheart. Mmm- it hurts when I swallow. I know, but Dr. Baker said lt'd make you feel better. That's my girl. You're gonna be all right. Sure she is. Just a flare-up with your old tonsils. Is Dr. Baker going to operate on me? He may take them out, but not while you're infected, not till you're all better. I don't know which to wish for... Getting better or staying like this. Let's take things one at a time. First you feel better. Pa must be back! We'll bring him right up to see his little girl. Mr. Edwards! Pa! Hi, Carrie! Mr. Edwards. What a wonderful surprise. Well, me and the bad penny keep showing up. How did you two ever happen to run into each other? Oh, well, I was in mankato, you sees, in the middle of a big crowd, and, uh... Well, you might say we was having a party. Your husband here, he, uh, he dragged me off and said I should come out and see the family. Wonderful. I had a hard time tearing him away. What about me? Don't I get a hug or anything? Oh, Charles, I'm sorry. I was just so surprised. So was I when I found him. I ain't gonna be able to do this much longer, you don't quit that growin'. Now, you quit that growin', ya hear? Say, where's half-pint? She's in bed. Her tonsils are acting up. I'll unhitch the horses. Why don't you two go on in and give her a surprise? Good idea. Come on. She's up there. Shh. Hey. What's this I hear about you, half-pint? Pa. How you feeling? It hurts when I swallow. Yeah. Sure it does. It'll be all better real soon, now. You wait and see. Brought you a little surprise from mankato. What is it? Why don't you look right over there? Mr. Edwards! Ha ha! Mr. Edwards, I never thought I'd see you again. Well, I promised, didn't I? How's my sweetheart? Why, she's burning up with fever. What are you doin' for her? Where's the doctor? Why ain't there a doctor here? The doctor was here. Little ones run fast fevers. They get over 'em just as quick. Sure. Why, you'll be up playin' in no time at all. Will you be here? Well, don't you worry none about that. You just get yourself well. That's not what I asked you. Oh, well, I'll tell you what. I'll be here when you get over that fever. That there's a promise. Now, you just get yourself some rest. Mr. Edwards... I can spit as far as you now. I've been practicing. Well, practice makes perfect. Get some sleep. Charles: You know, I think the best medicine for Laura was seeing you. She really perked up. Come on. You can bunk up here. Not the fanciest place in town, but it's the only loft around. At least you'll have plenty of privacy. Good fresh hay here. Look, you had a long day, uh... Why don't you rest up a little bit before supper, hmm? Ingalls... When I blew up at you in there, I, uh... I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. You were just worried about Laura. No. It's more than that. I owe it to you to tell you. You don't owe me anything. I want to tell you. I, uh... I was married once. Had me a daughter... Alice... A couple of years younger than Laura. They don't look alike, you know... But there's something about Laura... Guess that's why I take to her so. Well, they're gone now... Both of them. My fault. I brought small pox to 'em on a homestead claim so far out in the woods that... Nobody could hear my distress signals when we all come down with it. There's no way you can figure that's your fault. Well, I shouldn't have taken 'em so far away. That's why when I... When I saw Laura up there burning up with fever, I just, uh... For a minute, I was right back there. I'll tell you, if I could borrow some soap and that creek of yours, I'll make myself more welcome for dinner. It's coming right up. You know, ma'am, I just clean forgot what a good cook you were. Then I'll expect you to have seconds. Well, I really shouldn't. Mary, will you take Mr. Edwards' plate, please? Thank you, thank you. Mary: You're gonna stay, aren't you? Well, I hadn't thought much about it. You have to. You promised Laura you'd stay. I only said I'd stay till she got over her fever. That's all I promised. Mary: Please stay. Caroline: We really would like you to... Unless you have some other commitments somewhere. Commitments? No, ma'am. That's one thing I don't have. It's settled. Unanimous. You'll like walnut grove... Nice town, nice people. Well, a man can't just up and stay somewhere. He's got to have a place to live and a job. Well, you got the first. We can get you the second one tomorrow. Hanson can always use another good man at the mill. Well... I don't want to impose on you folks, you know? I'm not much of a one for settlin' down to a steady job. Laura: Please, Mr. Edwards? Please stay. Please stay. Talk yourself out of that one. Well... well, I'll make you a deal. I'll stay if you get on back to bed where you belong. Welcome home. You eat your stew. The widow snider. Hmm? The widow snider. What about her? Perfect for Mr. Edwards. It'd be a whole new life for both of them. Typical woman... Matchmaker. Wrong as usual. Why do you say that? I couldn't think of two people more different from each other. Everybody knows opposites attract. I always wondered why you went for a... Shy, sophisticated, educated man like myself. Charles, what did you say? I said good night, dear. Ja, sure. I can use someone with a strong back and a willingness to work. Well, Edwards here has got both. I can vouch for that. All right. You start now. Thank you. You won't regret it. Ja. You come on up to the office. I show you what you're going to do. - See you at supper. - All right. ♪ Old Dan Tucker was a fine old man ♪ ♪ Washed his face... ♪ ♪ Face in a frying pan ♪ ♪ Combed his hair with a wagon wheel ♪ ♪ Died with a toothache in his heel ♪ ♪ Get out of the way for old Dan Tucker ♪ ♪ It's too late to get his supper ♪ ♪ Supper's over and dinner's cookin' ♪ ♪ Old Dan Tucker just stands there lookin' ♪ ♪ Ohhhh ♪ Aaah. Mm-hmm. That's looking much better... Not so red anymore, just a pretty pink. Can I go to school tomorrow? Hmm. Well, we'll see. If her fever stays down, Mrs. Ingalls, she can get up this afternoon. Are you going to operate on me? Laura. Oh, for a sore throat? Well, no. I think I can guarantee you that I won't. That's good. And this is for being such a good girl and taking your medicine. Thanks. Now, I'll tend to my other patients... If I can get down from here without breaking a leg... I'm sorry, doctor. Perfectly all right, Mrs. Ingalls. I'll see a doctor. Hi, Jack. How you doin'? Mr. Edwards! Hello, half-pint! Well, I'll be. Whoa! Hey, you shouldn't be runnin' around like this. I'm all well. Doctor said. That's a good girl. Say, you know what? I was in the mercantile store today. Guess what I found. What? Well, close your eyes. No peekin'. Can't abide peekin'. Here you are. Lemon verbena! It's my favorite. How did you know? Well, a little "beadle" told me. You know miss beadle? Met her today. She asked about you. Now I can smell just like her. Oh, thank you. Oh. You going to go away again? Ma said you only promised to stay till I was better. Well, you know, I might just change my mind about that. Take a hard-hearted man to leave a pretty girl like you. Laura, voice-over: It was wonderful to have Mr. Edwards back with us again. He said it seemed like old times. Different house, different part of the country, but the same loving family. Oh, Mr. Edwards, uh, since you're working across from the post office, I wanted to ask you, would you mind stopping by and asking for our mail around closing time? Oh, I'd be glad to. - But that's our job. - We always do that. Shush, now. Sometimes the freight wagons are late or, uh, it comes in after the girls have started home, and then we don't get our mail until the next day. Oh, I'll be glad to do that. No trouble at all. Thank you. Well, come on, girls. Let's go, now. We don't want to be late. Caroline, that was really a very good idea. I mean, it wouldn't do to let those letters accumulate, the way they come pouring in one or two a month sometimes. Afternoon, ma'am. Oh. May I help you? Oh, my name's Edwards. I'm staying out at the Ingalls' place. Mrs. Ingalls asked me if I'd come in and pick up her mail for her. Well, their daughters usually do that. Are they ill? Oh, no, ma'am. No. No. She just thought something might come in after they'd gone home from school, you see. I just work right across the way. It ain't no trouble at all. Well, are you a member of the family? No, ma'am. Just an old friend. Well, there isn't anything for them today, but you'd have to get an authorization signed by Mr. Ingalls before I could accede to your request. Oh, that ain't even my request. It's Mrs. Ingalls'. Nevertheless. Uh-huh. Well, been nice talking to you, ma'am. Oh. Would you like a cup, ma'am? Oh! Oh, Mr. Edwards. Well... I'm afraid I owe you an apology. Oh, well, if you figured I was a drinking man, you'd be right more often than not. Well, it's really none of my business. I'll go along with that. But I can also see why, being the postmistress, you wouldn't want to hand out the Ingalls' mail to a drunkard. Well, then, you do accept my apology. Oh, sure do. Heh heh heh. Let's have a drink on it. Oh. Ha ha ha! Mrs. Snider. Oh, Mr. Hanson. Well, I guess I'd better be getting back to work. Uh-huh. I never knew her to drink. Oh, well, it's always them quiet ones. Yeah. Edwards: ♪ old Dan Tucker was a fine old man ♪ ♪ Washed his face in a frying pan ♪ ♪ Combed his hair with a wagon wheel ♪ ♪ Died with a toothache in his heel ♪ ♪ Get out the way for old Dan Tucker ♪ ♪ He's too late to get his supper ♪ ♪ Supper's over, and dinner's cooking ♪ ♪ And old Dan Tucker just stands there looking ♪ My, you must have had a good day. Oh, that I did, that I did. Got a fine post office there in walnut grove. Glad to have seen it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna wash up. Weren't no mail. It worked. It worked just like I said it would. Well, I wouldn't start sending out any wedding invitations until you check with Mrs. Snider. I intend to. Edwards: ♪ old Dan Tucker was a fine old man ♪ ♪ Washed his face in a frying pan ♪ ♪ Combed his hair with a wagon wheel ♪ ♪ Died with a toothache in his heel ♪ And what excuses we invent for ourselves, so that we may take that drink. The pressures of life, a disappointment, perhaps. Or a sorrow, where the pain may be temporarily lessened by whisky. But "temporarily"... That's the key word. For only in the inner peace of the lord, will we find lasting happiness. A man came to me the other day. His wife had requested that he see me. Now he told me that he drank for medicinal reasons. Now I have never heard of the good Dr. Baker prescribing a quart of medicine a day. I hope you didn't mind my asking our guest to stop by for our mail. Well, as a matter of fact, I was a little dubious at first. Ladies. - Oh, Mr. Hanson... - Good morning. A fine sermon, wasn't it? On the evils of drink. Well, I thought it went on a bit long. Well, I have known many a poor soul to take the wrong road. Yes, it's a common weakness with some men. Oh, Ja. And women, too. Charles and I were wondering if you would come over and have supper with us tonight. Oh, well, that's very kind of you, Mrs. Ingalls, but I'm sorry. I can't. Oh. Well, I'm sorry, too. Mr. Edwards was looking forward to seeing you. Well, I can't, but I thank you for the thought. Good-bye. Dear father in heaven, we thank thee. Bless this food to our use and bless our hearts to thy service. Amen. All: Amen. Half-pint, next time, get rid of the licorice before you say blessing. Next time, don't eat sweets before the meal. Yes, ma. I thought you said we was havin' company for dinner. She couldn't make it. Oh. Too bad. Probably knew she couldn't hold a candle to my 3 girls here. What did you girls learn in Sunday school today? Susan ziggler passed a note to Freddy Hopkins, and it made Amanda butterfield jealous! I meant about religion. Oh. Amanda wouldn't talk to Freddy in school, then she saw the note, and she got all mushy with him. She did, huh? You should have seen her! Charles: Well, that's all very interesting, but I think you go to Sunday school to learn about something else, don't you? Mary: Sunday school was all about Jesus. Well, that's more like it. Hmm. Laura: E... D... W... a... r... D... s. Is that right? Hey, that's good writing. You're doing real good with your writing. Miss beadle says I'm doing better. You sure you want to send a letter to yourself? I sure do. The good thing about having a friend is, uh, the friend don't ask you a whole lot of questions when you ask him to do you a favor. Another thing they don't do is they don't, uh, they don't go telling everybody what they done. There ain't any law in this family about having a secret, is there? No. Good. You and me... We got one. Can you spell "walnut grove"? - Sure. - Well, put her down there. Whoa. This here the mail wagon? Yep. I got this here letter I want you to mail for me when you get to mankato. Got a penny here for the stamp. Says it's going to walnut grove. That's right. Mister, you're in walnut grove. I know that! If you know that, why do you want to waste all that time and money sending this here letter clear into mankato so's it will wind up not 2 miles from where you're standing? That's my business. It's my penny. You sure you know what you're doing? Of course I know what I'm doing! This here's the United States mail service, ain't it? Of course it is. Well, it's your job to deliver the mail, so just go on. Deliver it. Smells funny. It's lemon verbena. Well, are you going to mail that thing, or you just going to sit there and look dumb? ♪ Old Dan Tucker was a fine old man ♪ ♪ Washed his face in a frying pan ♪ ♪ Combed his hair with a wagon wheel ♪ ♪ Died with a toothache in his heel ♪ ♪ Get out of the way, for old Dan Tucker ♪ ♪ It's too late to get his supper ♪ ♪ Supper's over and dinner's comin' ♪ ♪ Old Dan Tucker just stands there lookin' ♪ There you are. A week's money for a week's work. Thank you. Much obliged to you. I'll finish that Thompson order for you right after lunch. You know, I'm glad I got you. You do good work. Thank you. Mmm- Fine day, isn't it, ma'am? Oh... Oh, yes. Yes, it is. Say, I don't suppose there's any mail for the Ingalls. No. No, there isn't, but I think... I think there is one here for you. Yes. Oh. Uh-huh. Hmm. Well, much obliged to you, ma'am. Oh. Heh heh heh! Oh. Ha! Oh. Hmm. Would you like a drink? Oh, Mr. Edwards. Yes. Thank you. Mmm- are you calling it a day? Oh, yes, ma'am. I got to get back, see, for supper. Mr. Ingalls says he's going to catch us a whole mess of pike. Oh, I envy you. I haven't had pike for ages. Why, if Caroline Ingalls heard you say that, why, she'd be inviting you to dinner before the words was out of your mouth. Unfortunately, she isn't here. Well, you know what's going to happen when I get back home and tell her I run into you. Why, she's going to bawl me out right in front of the whole family for not asking you myself. She's going to say, "Mr. Edwards, well, you know how long "we've been trying to get Mrs. Snider to come to eat with us. "Now, you don't have the good manners to ask her when you find out she likes pike!" Oh, you're going to get me in all kinds of trouble, you don't come. Well... Since you put it that way, Mr. Edwards... Either grace is just set on being a lonely widow, or he doesn't appeal to her. Well, either way, it's kind of a shame. I had a feeling he kind of took to her a little bit. I know. That's why I feel so bad. Well, don't feel bad. What's meant to be is meant to be. Edward: Hello in the house! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's meant to be is meant to be. Hope you caught a lot of pike! We got company! Edwards: Here we go. Here we go. Yes. It was kind of you to bring me home, but I hate to think of you walking all the way back to the Ingalls'. Ma'am, it ain't nothing at all. And thank you for doing the stabling for me. My pleasure. After all that dancing, I'm not sure I'd have been up to it. Well, you're talking like you're an old lady, instead of being in the prime of your life. Oh. Listening to you, I almost believe it. I wouldn't lie to you. Wouldn't you, Mr. Edwards? No, ma'am. Only lie about poker hands and the size of the fish that got away. That's why you can believe me when I tell you how grateful I am to the Ingalls for persuading me to come to walnut grove. Oh, I am, too. It must have been a difficult decision to make. I mean, mankato's a much livelier community. You must have close friends there. What makes you think that? Oh, no reason. I just thought... Oh, I feel much closer to folks here. How'd you like to go fishing? Oh, I think I'd like that. Then we'll do her tomorrow. Well, um, good night, grace. Good night. Edwards: ♪ old Dan Tucker was a fine old man ♪ ♪ Washed his face in a frying pan ♪ ♪ Combed his hair with a wagon wheel ♪ ♪ Died with a toothache in his heel ♪ ♪ Get out the way for old Dan Tucker ♪ ♪ It's too late to get his supper ♪ Grace: We may not be catching many fish, but it sure is peaceful out here. Edwards: Well, uh, excuse me, ma'am, but, uh, you ain't doing it right. Huh? You see, what you got to do is you got to move that line every once in a while. Let them see the bait move. There. Just... Easy, now. That's good. Oh. Oh, look at that. Pull it up! Pull it up! Pull it up! Aah! Oh, it's too bad. I'm sorry. I'll bait your hook. Ooh, that's a lovely fragrance. Lemon verbena. Mr. Edwards gave it to me. Oh. It's lovely. You only need a few drops, and it lasts all day. Remember when you put it on that envelope? You could smell it all through the house. Uh, Laura, why don't you go, um, uh, get us some more worms? You know, we're running out of worms. Sure. Sure is... sure is funny how many worms you go through fishing. I thought the odor was familiar, but I just couldn't quite place it. Well, miss beadle uses it. Not on letters she receives. You sent that letter yourself, didn't you? Oh, well, ma'am, uh... I thought if it worked on Amanda butterfield... Who is Amanda butterfield? Well, she's a little girl in Laura's Sunday school class. She got jealous 'cause some other little girl sent a note to a boy she wouldn't give the time of day to, till she thought the other little girl was interested in him. So that's why you sent the letter to yourself? Well, you ain't mad at me, are you, ma'am? Oh... Oh, no... Not in the slightest. You look like you got a powerful thirst on. Ha ha ha! You sure you won't have some? Oh, no, ma'am. No, I'll just finish up what I have here, and then I'll be on my way. Wouldn't do to have a custodian of the United States mail falling asleep on the job. Say, how'd you like to go fishing again? Yes, I would. How about Sunday morning? After church? Well, I thought before. You know, the fish always bite better early. But Sunday's the lord's day. Oh, well, whatever you say, ma'am. How about I meet you afterward? Well, I thought maybe we could go together. Me? Oh, no, ma'am. Not me. Why not? I don't believe in it. Well, you do believe in god. Oh, I did once. Not anymore. You can't mean that... Surely you can't. Why, yes, ma'am, I do. Well, how about it, ma'am? How about what? Fishing Sunday. No. I'm afraid I can't. Oh, um... Well, uh, guess I best be on my way. You sure are hard to figure out, ma'am. We've been together most every day for 2 weeks. We had fun... at least I did. Thought you did, too. What difference does it make I ain't a church-going man? I'm still the same person I was when you met me. So am I. Yeah, well, uh, probably just as well. The fish ain't biting too good anyhow. Oh, Mrs. Snider, I'm so glad to see you. I just stopped by the post office. There's nothing for you today. Well, I really just stopped by to tell you how much we enjoyed having you over the other night. I enjoyed it, too. We'd like to have you out again. I couldn't. But I thought... I'm sorry. He didn't say 2 words during supper. Caroline, there's no law against being quiet. It has something to do with the widow snider. I told you how she was in town today. Several times. I'm going to talk to him. Caroline, if he wanted us to know what was wrong, he would have told us. Charles, I feel responsible. I've got to talk to him. Oh, Mrs. Ingalls. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Oh, no, no, not at all. Come on up. Sure am a sloppy packer. Well, then, I guess most men are. You're leaving us? Yes, ma'am, in the morning. I hoped you'd be happy here. Oh, have been, ma'am. Have been. You know, being here with you folks is... Then there's walnut grove, you know... no saloon. Town ain't no town at all without a saloon. And I'm not one for staying in one place very long, you know. Like to be on the move. I saw grace today. I really took to that woman. Don't mind admitting it. Well, we just put store in different things is all. I mean, I couldn't live her kind of life. I'd feel like a hypocrite. I don't understand what you mean. Well, she's a god-fearing person. I'm not. Just as simple as that. Oh, I ain't saying there ain't no god. It's just, I'm saying he ain't never had no time for me, so I ain't got no time for him. Do you believe in anything? Yes, ma'am. I believe in me. That's not enough for the widow snider. Is it enough for you? You tell me something, ma'am. You tell me why god let my wife and daughter die. Well... I'll, uh, I'll be gone by the time you get back from church tomorrow. Hate good-byes, so it's better all the way around if I'm just gone. Mr. Edwards, do you know what you're doing? You're punishing god, and if you go on punishing him for what happened in the past, you aren't going to have any room for the future. Oh, I'd be so sorry if you did that. Good-bye. Old Dan Tucker was a fine old man... Washed his face in a frying pan... Combed his hair with a wagon wheel... Died with a toothache in his heel.
