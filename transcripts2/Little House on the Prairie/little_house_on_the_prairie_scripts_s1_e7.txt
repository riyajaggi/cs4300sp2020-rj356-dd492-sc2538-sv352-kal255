 Little House on the Prairie (1974â€“1983): Season 1, Episode 7 - Town Party-Country Party - full transcript 
 Laura befriends Olga, a girl crippled from birth with one leg shorter than the other and who, as a result, is teased by Nellie and often left out of the other children's games. But when Charles comes up with a way to help Olga walk more normally, he meets unexpected resistance...from Olga's over-protective father.

 Girl: Don't peek. Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor, lawyer, Indian... Chief! Nellie first, Laura second. You pushed me. Sour grapes. I choose Cassie. Laura: I choose Christy. Nellie: Helen. Jane.

 Nellie: Margaret. 3 on a side. Only 3. 4. Choose 4, or give up. You can choose Olga. No. She's no good at relay. Besides, I don't need her anyway. I'm the fastest runner in school. I can run twice for our team, and we'll still beat you. You just think you will. Over to that post and back. 1! 2' 3- ready? Go! Girl: Go! Second girl: Hurry! Hurry!

 Yay! Third girl: Come on, Nellie! Girl: Hurry, Christy! Shh, Jack. Shh. Jack, shh. Shh. Mary: Laura, where are you? Why did you have to yell that way? Between you and Jack, I'm never going to find out. Find out what? If that crab could snap a stick in two. You scared him off. Better stay away from him before he snaps you in two. Oh, no. He couldn't do that. I'm too big, and his snappers are too little. You're not going to find out now. Ma wants you back at the house. She's got something to tell us. Next time, no barking. Otherwise, I'm leaving you home, and I mean it! I found her, ma. She was down by the pond. Baked apples! Your pa likes apple fritters. So do I. Me, too. I have a surprise for you. You're going to a party. We are? You mean a real one? Yes. I was in the mercantile today, and Mrs. Oleson invited you both to Nellie's birthday party tomorrow. Do we have to go? Laura... Well, you know how Nellie is. I know she was kind enough to invite you to her party. How would you feel if you were the only one who wasn't invited? Worse than being invited, I guess. All right. Remember that when you wish her a happy birthday. But aren't we supposed to take a present? We don't have anything to give her. I can think of something. Ma, don't let her. A present isn't necessary, but you could give her a big bunch of those lovely wildflowers that are growing out back. That's a good idea. All right, you two run along. I want to see your shoes polished so they shine like a... Christmas penny! Sunday smile. There. That's fine. Charles: Thank you. I'll have some more apple fritters. Laura? Mmm. Thank you. Pa, do you remember that crab I showed you... The one that lives under the rock in plum creek? I hope you've been keeping your distance. Oh, I have. Laura, that's not... Well, I have. I never get too close. What I was wondering is, do you figure he could snap a stick in two? All depends on the size of the stick. What about people? Could he bite off my whole big toe? No, he couldn't bite your big toe off, but he could give you a pinch you wouldn't forget in a hurry. I guarantee you that. You haven't told your pa about the party. Who's having a party? Mary: Nellie oleson. It's her birthday tomorrow, and we're invited. I can hardly wait! I can. Do you suppose their house is like Nellie's always saying... Boughten rugs in every room, lace curtains? The way she tells it, they got just about everything. Charles: I can tell you one thing they don't have. What's that, pa? Apple fritters like your ma makes. Or a sister with an appetite like that. Half-pint. Those things sticking out of the side of your head are your ears. You make sure you wash behind them. I will. Is she clean? Clean as a whistle. I'll have your dressing ribbons ready, Laura. Now let's see if you are. Ears? Just did them. Pa reminded me. Mm-hmm. Good. All right, now. Bundle up. Good girl. And up! You'd better hurry up. You don't want to be late for your first party. Up you go. Caroline? Mm-hmm? Come on out here. I've got a surprise for you. Mary will help you. Got a little surprise. Oh, no. What more could you ask for? A clean child and a clean dress, all at the same time. I've been thinking. I would like you to stay home with us. But it's a party, papa. Nellie said there would be cake, cookies, and games. Games. What kind of games? I don't know, papa. Running games, like I see them play at school? Maybe, papa, but if so, I sit and watch like I do at school. Do I look all right, papa? Yes, very nice. Can I go now? Bye, grandma. Bye, pa. You said she needed school. All right, she goes to school. She has to learn. What she needs to know, she could learn from you. She needs friends her own age. I have seen her in the schoolyard, sitting by herself. She has no friends in that school. She would be better off staying home with us. I have a fool for a son. And I have a mother who does not listen. At this party, she will try to keep up, try to run. She will fall and hurt herself. No, she will not. She promised she wouldn't. I had schooling, but I learned more from watching people... And animals. I have seen what a flock of chickens will do to one that is different from the rest. They kill it, all of them. They swarm over it, trampling it, and they peck... It to death. Girls: Hello, Mary. Hello, Laura. Wait a minute! Man: Well, hello there, young ladies. Girl: Hi, Mr. Oleson. My, aren't you all just as pretty as that bunch of flowers. Mary: Thank you, Mr. Oleson. You go right in. You know where it is... in the back there. Mary: Yes. Thank you. Come on. Wait till you see. Child: An alligator... A donkey... Happy birthday, Nellie. They're from both of us. This is from me and Cassie. I made her myself, and you get to name her. We're playing. She didn't even like it. Course she did. She's just excited, is all. Let's see what they're playing. Laura: Noah's ark! It ain't Noah's. It's mine! I meant like Noah in the Bible. And there's two of everything, except for the giraffe because Nellie hid it on me 'cause she knew it was my favorite. Did not. You lost it. Did not. You took it. Uh-uh, will. It's your sister's birthday. Nobody cares about your old ark anyway. There's no sense in fussing over the ark when you have so many other toys to play with. They can't play with my toys. They can't ride my velocipede. Now, children. Oh, Nellie, show the girls your birthday doll. Nellie: All right, but nobody can touch. When she's like this, she's asleep. And when I stand her up, she's awake. Her dress is real silk, and she has real petticoats with real ruffles and real lace. I told you not to touch! You did that on purpose! Laura: I didn't, Nellie. Honest. You did so. Just 'cause you'll never have a doll this good, you don't want me to have one. I wish I'd never asked you to my party. Oh, now, Nellie, you mustn't be rude. Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk. I'm sorry, ma'am. It was an accident. Ma can fix it. She's finer than most with a needle. No, no. That won't be necessary. I'll have it repaired. Don't be upset, Nellie, dear. You should learn to be more careful with things that don't belong to you. Yes, ma'am. It might be wise if you all went outside to play. There are just too many things in here that can be damaged. Willie: Yeah, come on! Willie: Tag. You're it. Christy: Cassie's it. Come on! Are you all right? I'm all right. I'm ok. You twisted it when you fell. I did something to it. Maybe we could go sit on the store steps. Here, I'll help you. Maybe I should go get Mr. Oleson to get Dr. Baker. No. It's not that bad. I was going to ask you something. But I better not. Ma says it's not polite to pry. You were going to ask about my leg? Well, kind of. How long has it been that way? Since I was born. Maybe, if we walk slow... There are a lot of frogs down by the waterwheel over there. We just might catch one. We can try. Come on. Olga, how was the party? Nice, grandma. Very nice. The house was grand, with rugs and fine curtains, and they had a clock as tall as papa. And what did you get to eat? Cake and cookies and candy from the store. I was polite. I took only one piece. Yes. And you played with all the children? Yes, papa. Nellie let me play with her new doll, and her brother let me play with his toy animals. I just played, and I played, and I played. Did they laugh at you and call names? No, papa. But you did not play with them. They let you sit in the corner and watch. Tell me the truth. Inside, I watched, but outside, I talked to a girl. One girl. Just one? A very nice girl, papa. Laura Ingalls. She hurt her ankle, so we talked. Always the same. You should have stayed home with your grandma and me. But we had a good time, papa. I made a new friend. One friend. Caroline: Mary said the fault was more Nellie's than Laura's. She also said the dress could be mended in a minute. It's going to take a lot longer than that for Laura's ankle to heal. She's not going to be able to walk to school for 2 or 3 days. She was unhappy about that until I promised her I'd teach her how to make oatmeal cookies. Little half-pint gets hurt pretty easy, but she mends fast. What would you think of the girls having a party of their own? I think it's a fine idea. Good. Then... Sounds like we have mice. All right, girls, come on out. What are you two doing out of bed? Listening. How can we have a party when it's nobody's birthday yet? That's the best reason to have a party... no reason at all. Just let your friends know you want to have them around. Do we get to invite who we want, all by ourselves? Of course. It's your party. Of course, I know you'll want to invite Christy and Cassie and your new friend Olga... And Nellie. Nellie? It's the polite thing to do. I reckon you know best. I'll ask her on Monday. Good. Now, off to bed, both of you. Mary and Laura: Good night, ma. Good night, pa. Good night, girls. Good night. Our own party! I can't believe it! Our own party, and we can invite anybody we want! Yeah. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Nellie said no? And Cassie's coming and Christy and sudie, and you can come, can't you, Olga? I will ask my father. He'll say yes, won't he? Laura especially wants you to come. I went to Nellie's party. I forgot. She's coming, too. Good. Laura won't think so. She'll be afraid Nellie will spoil things. No. I mean, it is good of you to invite her. It'll be good for her to come. Poor Nellie. Poor? The olesons? They're the richest folks in town. Nellie's poor. She has no happiness inside. You know, that's a strange thing to say. My grandma says that you know what's inside a person by the face they wear. I guess, but I never thought of Nellie that way before... I mean, being poor. Makes me feel sorry for her... Almost. Hi, pa! Hi, Mary! Everybody said yes! Laura: Do you hear, pa? Everybody said yes! Is that a fact? What was the question? The party! Mary invited them to our party. That's right, you're having a party. It clean slipped my mind. You're teasing again, pa. Why does Patty keep throwing her shoes, pa? Well, did you ever notice how that left foreleg of hers is bowed? Well, I got to give her a special fitting. If I don't get it just right, she'll keep throwing that shoe right back at me. Could I ask you something? I don't see why not. It's been on my mind for a long time, and when you mentioned about Patty... What makes cripples? Well, accidents, mostly. Not that kind. I mean like being born crippled, like Olga. Her legs don't match. One is shorter than the other. That doesn't seem fair, does it? No, sir, it sure doesn't. I'll tell you, half-pint, I don't know if I've got an answer that will satisfy either one of us. Some folks just come into the world that way. I don't know why. I don't think anybody else does, either. I do know that most of them seem to be born with some extra-special gift. Is gumption a gift? Sure it is. I'm sure Olga has gumption. Well, from what you've told us, she's got a big heart, too. And a heart is more important than a leg, isn't it? A lot more important. You've been thinking a lot about Olga lately, haven't you? She's so nice, pa. I keep hoping that her leg will get better. I remember the other day, we were walking past hanson's mill, and she stepped on this plank and didn't limp at all. She what? There was this plank about so thick... Mm-hmm? And she stepped on it with her short leg. And she walked the whole length of it? Yes. And when she could step on it with her short leg, she didn't limp at all. If there were enough planks scattered around, she'd be able to run and play like the rest of us. Yeah, I bet she could. Why don't you go on back in the house and rest your ankle, huh? Yes, pa. Olga. It's Mr. Ingalls, grandma. Mrs. Nordstrom, I'm Charles Ingalls. You might say we're neighbors. Mr. Ingalls. Pleasure. Olga talks about your Laura. My wife's looking forward to meeting you. She sends her regards, and she wants to meet Olga, too. I can see your son's pretty busy, but I was hoping to get a chance to talk to the two of you, if I might. Yes. Will you hold these for me, please? Yes, grandma. Thank you. Could you follow? Jon? This is Mr. Ingalls. He would like to speak to you. Mr. Nordstrom. My daughter Laura has made quite a friend in your daughter Olga. Actually, Olga's why I'm here. This is going to come out a little bit awkward, but, uh... I've got a pretty good horse, and if I don't fix her shoe just proper, she comes up lame. A special shoe is the difference between being sound and lame. That got me to thinking. What I'm trying to say is, I'd like permission to work on one of Olga's shoes. You've got a miracle in your pocket, huh? No. I told you this was going to sound awkward, but I think if I could... Olga was born with a lame leg. We accept that. So does she. We've got a saying in this part of the country... The lord helps those that help themselves. I'll take care of Olga myself. I don't need your help. Mr. Nordstrom, your daughter watches the other children run and play. She seems to do it with a happy heart, and that's to her credit. I really think if you gave me permission to work on that shoe, she might get a chance to do some running herself. I did not send for you. I do not want you here. I'll thank you to get off my property. I don't see what harm it would do to give me a chance... Good-bye. A pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Nordstrom. Could you have done it? Could you have made a shoe that would have helped Olga? Oh, I don't know. She wouldn't be any worse off than she is now. Just a stubborn man. We'll just have to forget about it, I guess. Mrs. Nordstrom. Mrs. Nordstrom, I'd like you to meet my wife Caroline. How do you do? Mrs. Nordstrom, and that's Olga. Olga: Hello. You are very kind. Could I talk to you a little? Certainly. Olga, why don't you come back to the house with me and say hello to Laura? Yes, ma'am. Mr. Ingalls, my son is not like you think. He loves Olga very much. They were always very close. Only since the death of Olga's mother, he only wanted to protect Olga. He even didn't want her to go to school. Your son isn't the easiest man in the world to talk to, Mrs. Nordstrom, but I guess that does explain some of it. He would like to build a wall around Olga, that she cannot be hurt, but that would be wrong because she would have no one when we are gone. Does he know you're here? No. I will tell him later. You will make a shoe for Olga? I'll try. How does that feel? Maybe a little more. All right. How's that? Better. Feel even? Then we got the right height. All we have to do now is build it. No school today. You should be helping grandma. Party day, papa. She's invited to a party at the Ingalls'. Her little friend invited her. Now, before noon? Yes. She was asked to come very early in order she can help them to get ready. Now, run along, now. Bye, grandma. Bye, pa. Go ahead. Now try to walk on it. It's all right. Go ahead. Laura: Pa, it's perfect. Olga, look at you. All right, try it again, a little bit faster. Let's go outside and practice before the others get here. They plain won't believe their eyes. It's a miracle! It is. It's a miracle. They're coming! They're all here! Caroline: Good. They're on time. Charles: I think I'll just leave you ladies to your guests. Coward. Mm-hmm, you're right. Come on. Let's say hi to them. When they come in, you just sit where you are. I got a good idea how we can surprise them. How you doing, girls? Girl: Where's Laura? She's right inside. Go on in. Have fun, now. Girl: Hi, Laura. Other girls: Hello, Mrs. Ingalls. Caroline: Hello, girls. Laura: Didn't Mary tell you it wasn't dress-up, Nellie? Nellie: Mama always has me dress, even for country parties. Where's your room? Mary and me have the loft. Mary: Do you want to see it? Come on. Nellie: I have my own room. Girl: Yes, you told us. Nellie: A loft. That's like an attic. Second girl: I wish ma would let me sleep in the attic. Mary: Did you ask her? Wouldn't do no good. We don't have an attic. Olga, you wait until we're all up in the loft. Then you go outside. Do you remember where I showed you we were going to play? Yes. You go sit out there, and we'll be out there in just a few minutes. I'll say, "let's play two o' cat." Then when your turn comes, you run as fast as you can, and that will surprise them. Yeah. This is the kind miss beadle wears. It smells so pretty. Nellie: Where are your dolls, Laura? I don't play with dolls. I play in the creek. I know where... the wide place we passed on the way here. Nellie: You and Mary share the same bed? Mary: Yes. Pa made our bed. I have my own bed in my own room. It's too nice of a day to be poking around inside. Let's go outside and play. Mary: Yeah. Come on, Nellie. Come on, everybody. Girl: What will we play? Laura: How about 30' cat? Others: Yeah! Nellie: That's a boy's game. We're tomboys. We can use the buckets for bases. Let's play over there. Come on! I'll choose one side. Nellie, you choose the other. Nellie: Since I'm a guest, I get to choose first. I choose Mary. Mary: Oh... I choose Olga. You just said that so when you lose, you can blame it on her. Well, who says I'm going to lose? I choose Cassie. I choose Christy. Rosemary. Helen. Now, that's 4 each. Since you chose first, we get to hit first. That will be home base. Come on! This will be home base, and since there's only 4 on a side, I'll catch for your team. Olga, you hit first. Come on, Mary. Pitch it good! Come on, Olga. You can do it. Come on! Run, Olga! Hurry! Go! Run! Hurry! Girl: You ran, Olga. You beat Nellie. What happened? Olga: It's Mr. Ingalls. He made it for me. It's wonderful, Olga. I never saw anything like it. You run better than I do now. It was Laura's idea to surprise you all. You surprised us, all right. You sure surprised me. Girl: Surprised Nellie, too. You going to stand around gawking all day or you going to play 3 old cat? Olga: Isn't it nice? And I can run and play now. Come on, play! Laura: Yeah. You go out, and we'll beat you. Christy, you're up next. Yay! Run, Christy! Go! Go! Come on, Christy! Go! Go! Go, Mary! Go! Run, Rosemary! Run! Run! Come on, Rosemary! Faster, Rosemary! Faster! Girl: Run faster! Faster, Nellie! Hurry! Go, Helen! Run! Hurry, Helen! Go! Go! Run! Come on, Helen! Hurry! Go, Helen, go! You bat again, Olga. Laura: One more hit, and we win. Girl: Yeah. Come on. You can do it. Go! Go, Olga! Go! Go! Girls: Yay! Girl: What are we going to play now? Laura: How about drop the handkerchief? That's no fun. How about another game of 3 o' cat? Second girl: No. You already won that. How about hide and go seek? Other girls: Yeah! No, it's too hot. I know. Let's all take off our shoes and go wading in the creek. Not here. In the big pond. No. That's no fun. You said you liked playing in the creek. You said you liked it better than dolls. Last one there, kiss a pig. Come on! I'll stay here with you, Olga. No, it's all right. You go on and play, and I'll wait for you. But I go wading all the time. I don't want to go wading today. No, really. I told you. You go on. It's all right. I'll just stay and wait. Nellie: Quit it! Stop! Quit it! Quit it! I don't mind if you go wading in the pond, Nellie, just so long as you don't come over here by this log. Why shouldn't I go there if I want? Look there in the grass. That's my special, secret place. And since you're my special friend, I'll show you what's there. It's real pretty, see? Look over there. Get close. Closer. Get closer. Can you see it? See? Get closer. Look out, Nellie! Look out! He'll bite your toes! The other way! Hurry! Run! Run! Hurry! Run! Let's go have some cake. Girl: Boy, wasn't that funny? Boy, wasn't that funny? I knew you were up to something. Do you have to shout to your mother? When you lie to me, yes. Olga had 2 pair of shoes. She is wearing one pair. What have you done with the others? You give them to Ingalls. Yes! Yes, I did! Ingalls... I told you not to meddle. I know what you told me. Laura: Olga's it. Laura: Olga, you're it. Girl: Uh-oh, here she comes. Look out! Look out! Girl: Uh-oh. Laura: Hurry up, Olga. Get somebody! Hurry! Olga: Did you see me run, papa? I saw you. Watch me play, papa. Watch me play. Girl: Look out! Girl: Be careful! Girl: You're it. Second girl: Look out. She's going to get you. Third girl: Hurry! Hurry! Olga: Who's it? That's the best party in the whole world, ma'am. I thank you for asking me. Thank you, Christy. You know you're welcome anytime. Are you sure none of you girls need a ride home? No, sir, thank you. We're just fine. Well, I'm not just fine. That pond's dangerous, Mr. Ingalls. Got a crab in it that big. Come close to getting my whole toe bit off. Thank you. Good-bye, Nellie. Bye, Nellie! Now, I wonder where Nellie got the idea that crab could bite her toe off. I think it would be a good idea if we walk home a ways with our guests. Well, why don't you do that? Bye, girls. Bye. Second girl: Bye. Thank you. Can I walk with them, pa? Can I? My mother is right. She has a fool for a son. She did have.
