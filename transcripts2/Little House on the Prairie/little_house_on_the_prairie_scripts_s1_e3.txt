 Little House on the Prairie (1974â€“1983): Season 1, Episode 3 - 100 Mile Walk - full transcript 
 When their wheat crop is ravaged by a hailstorm, the discouraged Walnut Grove men leave town to search for work. During his long walk, Charles meets Danny Peters, a flamboyant hard rock miner who recommends Charles for the well-paying but dangerous job of 'powder monkey', part of a 2-man hole drilling team needed to hand-set blasting charges in a rock quarry. Meanwhile, back in Walnut Grove, Caroline organizes the women to try to salvage what they can of the damaged wheat. In the end, though separated by distance and circumstance, the pioneer families work together to meet the challenge of unpredictable prairie life.

 Thank you, lord. Charles: What we got out there is 100 acres of wheat ready to harvest. Come on, everybody, write that down... 100. And it ought to yield about... oh, 35 bushels to the acre. Thank you. And right now wheat's selling for just around 75 cents a bushel. Now, how much money is that? - I've got it. - So have I. Both: $2,625! Right.

 It's almost too wonderful to be true. Do you know what that will mean for us? New dresses for my girls, to start with. A nice warm coat for you, curtains for the windows. Boots for you. The very first nickel we spend goes on boots. What's the matter with these? They were just starting to get comfortable on me. I was afraid one morning you were going to pull them up, and they'd slide clear up to your knees. Come on. Let's make a list. Everything we need. Start right out with dresses for you girls. Shoes for everyone. That's a must. All right. Shoes. Curtains for the windows. Got that?

 Yes, pa. Not so fast. Ma needs some new dishes and... I'm writing down a rocking horse for Carrie. A rocking horse for Carrie! You know, that reminded me of something that just popped clean out of my head. What is it? You come with me, and I'll show you. Come on... everybody. Mary: What is it, pa? Laura: I can't wait. Won't you tell us, pa? Please? Caroline: Oh, Charles! Mary: Oh, pa! Horses! Laura: Look at them, Mary! What a surprise! Boy, aren't they pretty! Be careful till they get to know you a little bit. Charles, you didn't even hint. I wanted it to be a surprise. It certainly is. Well, they're good, stout animals, both of them. Only 8 years old. Got a lot of good years left in them. Girls: They're so pretty! Made a good trade with hanson, too, on the oxen. We'll be able to pay the balance as soon as I sell the wheat. Oh, that's good. It's something we really needed. I know. I'm so glad! So am I... So now, Mrs. Ingalls, I'll be able to drive you to church in style. Charles! What's the matter? Uh, nothing. It's just a little rain. We could use it. What about the wheat? Oh, it's real good for the wheat... Long as it's standing, soak it real good. Still got a little fire there going. I'll make you some coffee, huh? I'll get it. Go on. Sit down. Really coming down. Mmm- that's good. We could use some rain. Long as it doesn't soak that field so much we can't get Mr. Hanson's new reaper in there. He's got a new mccornhck reaper. I tell you about it? Yes. That's a fine machine. Hail! I'm soaked to the skin. Got pretty cold out there, I'll tell you. This coffee's going to taste good. Looks like the storm's about over. The wheat's gone. Look, there's nothing to be solemn about. I guess you... Might say that we're back where we started. I mean, it's just one harvest. Now, what's one harvest in a man's life, huh? It's nothing. Oh! Ollie! Ollie! You take a rest. We can't hear ourselves talk. Like I said, konig. I know. Everybody here is in the same boat. The hail don't play no favorites. If falls on every man alike. There ain't no one for 50 miles around that's gonna make a crop, but I want to do something about it, but there's not anything that I can do except weep. I can't speak for Williams here, but what I've got in mind is a business proposition. You loan me $200, and I'll pay interest. Confound it, man! That is just what I want to do, but I haven't got $200 to loan, and with no wheat to mill, I ain't gonna get it. Williams: Mr. Hanson. My wife Bess, she took sick. With 5 kids to feed and all, I just don't know how in the world I'm gonna get by unless you can... Jim... I'm sorry. The answer is no. Hup! Charlie. Guess that's about the quickest deal you ever made... Selling a team of horses one day, getting them back the next. I don't like that kind of deal. Well, neither do I. Always dreamed of owning a team like this. But a man can't keep what he can't pay for. What are you going to do? I'll go looking for work, like everybody else. Got to have cash for winter. I'll see you. Take care. I don't know how far I'm going to have to go... 100 miles, maybe more. There'll be a lot of men looking for work, and not many jobs around. You will write to us? Oh, yeah. I'll write just as soon as I get settled. Might have to go as far as sleepy eye or mankato, so it could be a while before that first letter comes. Thank you. I'll miss you. Give Carrie a kiss for me, huh? Love you. Oh! Look, I've got to be going, love, that's all. All right? Pa! You forgot something. One more time can't hurt, peg. I'll be careful. That'll be the day. You'll blow yourself to bits, more like it. See if I care. You'd care. I know you would. But I'll be coming back to farm for the rest of my life. You... Can you manage the farm while I'm gone, or will you have to hire help? Never hire help. I could manage this farm as good as you... maybe better. All right, then. How about it? All right. Boy: Let's go. Let's go! Man: Come on! Come on! Um-u hey... You take good care of your mother while I'm away, understand? Yeah, pa. I love you, woman. Take care. Charles Ingalls. Jack Peters. Had this thing tied up with a string, but the string wore out. Just going to have to flap, I guess. No, it ain't. That's what I was trying to catch up with you for. Got a piece of rawhide here. Ought to hold it for a while. Hey... yeah! Yeah, it's good. Where are you heading? Work. Same here. I guess everybody is. I suppose. That'll hold it. All I can give you is my thanks. And your companionship. You got it. Jack: Tastes great, smells great. A smell like this on the wind will bring the bears out for a mile... Maybe more. Hello. My name is Jacob. Is it all right I share your fire? Sure enough. Come on, sit down. My name is Charles Ingalls. That's Jack Peters. Mr. Ingalls, Mr. Peters. How about something to eat? No. No, thank you. I had food. We got plenty. What do you think, Jack? Hungrier than we were. Big as he is, hungrier. Come on. Join us. Just going to go to waste, unless you can figure out a way to put stew in your pocket. Thank you. You cooked... I'll clean up. I don't think you're going to have to clean up. Thank you. Hey! With those boots, you're the same as barefoot. All right, but they're the only boots I've got. I tan hides. Make boots at night after farm work. Bring two pair to sell. Right away, got a customer. Hmm? They're fine-looking boots. Fit me like they were made for me. Ja. I can't pay you for them. Someday. Someday. Are you men dead set on working harvest? There's going to be a lot of men looking for a few jobs, you know. You may not find one. Well, we don't have much choice. Would you work in a quarry... Mining hard rock? That's where I'm going. I know the boss well enough to get you a shot at a job. Ever do any double jacking? What's that? A double Jack's a sledgehammer. You swing it with both your hands. You hammer a drill in the rock, and you make holes to put the dynamite in. It's risky. It's hard work. And you'll have to show you can do it to get the job. Do you want to try it? Oh, jumpin' jiminy, I do. So do I. You'll get a chance. Jack: Swan Benson and roof Taylor. Best double Jack team around here. They're drilling holes so we can dynamite that big slab into pieces small enough to handle. Then the teams haul it off to the railroad. Railroad hauls it off to where stonemasons will use it for bridge piers and buildings. Now watch. The man with the double Jack... all he needs is a good eye. The man holding the drill... Strong nerves. That's it. What if the hammer miss? If the hammer miss? The man holding the drill will have to pick his nose with his elbow. Jack: Charles, Jake... Boss Tom Cassidy. Howdy. Charles: How are you? Mr. Cassidy. Peters tells me you're a double Jack team looking for work. Hmm? That's right. Roof! Swan! Sit down for a minute. Got a new team here, wants to show their stuff. You can use their tools. Thank you. You hammer, Mr. Ingalls. Change around. Cassidy: Come on! Pick it up, pick it up! Get the swing in that thing! Look, uh... my partner and I work a lot faster when we're getting paid. All right, you got the job. Go on... sign on, pick up your tools. Come on, you two. Back to work. It's over. Get on with it. Glad you have hands still to shake with. Good morning, ladies. Ladies! May I have your attention, please? Well, I'm glad so many of you could come. I thank you for it. We all have the same problem... Feeding our families next winter. And you've shown by coming here today that you think we'll all fare better if we work together. Does anybody want to say anything? Yes, I do. I'd like to say that I don't think lt'd be sensible to try and harvest any of that wheat, if that's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do. Well, my sakes... It's all lying flat on the ground. I know it's lying flat on the ground. I didn't say it would be easy to harvest it. Easy! Gracious... l just don't think we can. We can if we want to badly enough. How? We'll have to go into the fields, pick up a few stalks at a time, by hand, rake some of it, put it into sheaves so that it will dry out, then thresh it. And how do you expect to thresh that wheat? The same way Ruth did. "And she gleaned until even, "and then she beat out that she had gleaned with flails and winnowing." We have to decide now. Shall we put it to a vote with a show of hands? All those in favor. All in favor wins. My back is killing me, and we're getting nothing done. Well, I'm losing fat. What do you think you're doing, hope? I'm making sheaves and tying them so the grain will dry properly. I'll get to yours in a minute... if you have any. Them skimpy things, you call them sheaves? This is a waste. We're not going to get enough to make any flour. Come winter, we're all going to go hungry. We certainly will go hungry, Willa, if we all work like you do. You're going to have to try harder. Hi, Jacob. Charlie. I need some caps, Tom. All right. What are you doing with all the dynamite? I'm a powder monkey. It's just like double jacking, you know. Not too many men want that kind of work, and anytime I want a job, I most times can get it. Well, I can see why. Well, the wife made me quit. She said she'd be able to sleep better nights, you know. So I took up wheat farming. Wheat farming! You don't get blown up that way. You just get hailed out. Here you are. Thanks, Tom. What does powder monkey do? Oh, I'll show you. Right... stick of dynamite, right? You can drop it, you can burn it, you can step on it. Nothing. To make it explode, you need one of these... and a fuse. And you stick it on the end, and you got to crimp the cap so it won't fall off. You know, we got a tool for doing that, but he won't use it. You're an old woman, Tom. Anyway, you take this, and you poke it into the dynamite. We can't get any drilling done till you get your tools in your hand, and the work is that way. Yes, Tom. Yes, Tom. We're going, Tom. Man: Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! Ahh. Hold it. Let's take a break. Ja, that's good. A little water, huh? Ah, good. How is your hand? Ah, just a little stiff, that's all. Forget it. Ahh. I worry I do it worse next time. You want to worry, worry about the drilling contest and how we're going to win it. Us? Us. You think we can? For $50 in prize money split between us, we got to win it. Oh, I don't know. All them other fellas... Pretty good. Well, we're pretty good, too, and getting better every day. Here we go. There. What's the matter, Charlie? Nothing. Just thinking. About home and the wife and the kids? They've just about finished supper now. Got the dishes done... 3 little girls will be getting ready for bed. I miss my elna, too. My Peggy's a scrapper. I miss that. She'd have to be to be married to you. She's always gmng me what for, you know? Don't change me shirt, don't change me socks... Whenever I come home late for supper. You know what they're like. I miss her. Miss my lad. You got any children, Jake? I don't know. You don't know? My elna... Maybe I have baby now. Before I get home, for sure. Oh... that's nice. Ja. That's a shame you can't be with her. Oh, I am with her... In my heart. All of the time. Laura, voice-over: Tuesday was mail day. We had to work, just like any other day. But on Tuesday, work had to wait until the mail came... If there was any. I'm Mrs. Elna jacobsen. Have I got a letter, please? Oh... Oh! "Dear family, "I was just saying to one of my new friends "that 100 miles is not a long distance... Except when it lies between you and the ones you love." "I visit with you each day in my thoughts, "and I count the hours until we can... "Be together again. "Take good care of each other. "Know that I am well... "And love you all very much. Charles." Well... pa's all right. Now we have to get back to work. Come on. Oh, look at that. He spelled the very first word wrong. D-e-r-e, dear. Ha ha! And one "g" in Peggy! Spelling. Spelling's for girls. You're going to learn how to spell. I'd rather be like pa. Why? Because he can't spell? No. Because he's the best. The best powder monkey this side of the Mississippi. Yah! Hey! It's Monday! It's 8:00 in the morning! Day after tomorrow's Wednesday, and we've done nothing yet. Come on! Let's get to work! Ha ha ha! One of these days, he's going to blow this whole quarry off the map. We'll be out of work if he do. Hey... how about the 3 of us having a footrace? That's how you tell a good man... When he's got bounce at the end of the day. Now, Charlie, Jacob... you're all keeping bad company. Stop it! Hey! April fool! Back to work! Drillers, grab your steel. First team to drive the white line to the rock wins the money. Go ahead. Jack: Come on, Jacob! Come on, Charlie! Everybody ready? Go! Jack: Come on, Charlie! Man: Move! Hurry up! Jack: Drive it, Charlie! Drive it! Switch! Jack: Get in there, Jacob! Hit! Jack: Hit! Man: Come on! Drive it in there! Jack: Come on, Jake! Come on, Jake... Drive it! Go on, Jacob! Jack: Drive it in! Go! Jack: Come on, Jake! Go! Go on! We got 'em! Go! Go! Go! Go! Hold it! Hold it! You win! We got it! All right, now, you're going to get your $50, but you'll get it when you get your pay, and that's not for two days yet. We still got work to do. Come on, boys, work's a-waiting! Come on, let's go! Hey! Hey... Big winners, right? Charles: That's right! Hard-rock miners, right? Right! You were lucky, that's all! Ha ha! A real hard-rock miner wouldn't let you carry his... Jack! Tom: Here's your pay... And thanks for a good job. Yeah. And here's your $25 for winning the drill-off. And... Jack Peters' pay. Say a word to his wife for me when you give it to her, will you? I'll do that. This is where I turn off. Good luck. Thank you. Go on. What are you waiting for? Jacob: It's a boy! Pa... Why, pa? Pa... I thought you were the best. Why, pa? Why? I thought you were the... I only live about 10 miles from here. I... Well, I might stop by and... See how you're getting along every once in a while, huh? Well, maybe you and your mom could come out and visit me and my family sometime. Got a lot of good fishing around our place. Yeah, all right, Mr. Ingalls. We'll come over. Don't know just when. Now that my pa died, got a lot of work to do. Lot of work to do. Laura: Ma! Ma! Pa's back!
