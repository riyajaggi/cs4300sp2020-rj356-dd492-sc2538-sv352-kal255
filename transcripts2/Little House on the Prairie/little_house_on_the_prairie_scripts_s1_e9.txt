 Children: Bye, miss beadle! Nellie: Miss beadle. Yes, Nellie. Mama says to come to tea tomorrow. She has a special new kind of tea. Why, thank you, Nellie. You tell your mother I'll try. Bye, miss beadle. Good-bye, Nellie. We haven't even had a turn yet. Laura: Well, I'm still on.

 Miss beadle: Larry, stop chasing them! Aah! Me? You want me to teach the children? Mr. Hanson: Ja. We want you very much. Mr. Oleson: We made a list. Dr. Baker: We started a list, Mrs. Ingalls, but you're our first and our only choice. Mr. Hanson: Because you are the best. That is the reason, Mrs. Ingalls. You are the best qualified. I'm sure I'm very flattered. Mrs. Oleson: You have had experience teaching, haven't you? Yes, Mrs. Oleson. I've taught school. That was a long time ago. I'm rusty.

 I'm sure there must be new methods. Dr. Baker: Not that rusty, Mrs. Ingalls. I've got a strong hunch you've been keeping your hand in here at home, teaching your own kids. We know this is a lot of extra work for you. You still have your own family to take care of and all. Mrs. Ingalls, our children really need you. Mr. Oleson: We'll pay you the same as miss beadle. A windfall, I should think. Mr. Hanson, it's so important. I wonder if I could think it over a little. Sure. Sure. You'd want to talk it over with Charles. Then we will wait. Mrs. Oleson: Before any decision is made, I would like to have an assurance. Ja, Mrs. Oleson. Well, uh, Mrs. Ingalls has 2 children of her own, and I would like to be assured, if she takes the position, that she won't show favoritism for her own 2 children over other children. Mr. Hanson, I've made up my mind. I'll teach the children. Oh! You will? Fine. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mrs. Ingalls. Dr. Baker: Thank you, Mrs. Ingalls. Thank you, Ingalls! You're welcome, doc. You better get some sleep, teacher. You got to get up early tomorrow. I have such a terrible temper. You certainly do. It's that Mrs. Oleson. She can make me so angry. If she says no, I'll say yes, no matter what. Well, it's not too late. You can always change your mind. After I gave my word? Mm-hmm. Oh, no, Charles. I couldn't do that. Then what's the problem? Well, if I could just be sure that I'm doing it because they need me and not just to spite her. They need a teacher, don't they? Yes. You're the best one for the job, right? Right? Yes. Then go to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. My mother wasn't sure if she wanted Mrs. Ingalls to teach or not. Why not? She's not qualified. What's that mean? She can't teach. Mary said she used to be a teacher. Well, that was a long time ago. Willie: Everything's different now. Mother decided she'd wait and see. Take your seats. Good morning, children. Well, we don't need to introduce ourselves. I know who all of you are, and you all know who I am. I'm going to be your teacher for a while, until miss beadle is able to return. What seems to be the trouble? Harry, suppose you tell me what the trouble is. You ain't a teacher. I've been asked to teach. Still don't make you a teacher. I have taught school... In the east. Ah, that was a long time ago. It ain't the same now. I see. I think you all must have liked miss beadle very much. Isn't that true? Children: Yes. Well, it's not easy to know what somebody else can do... Until you give him or her a chance. Tell me, Harry, what do you do best? I can bat a ball farther than most anybody, most men, even. Well, all right. Suppose you show us. Come on. Everybody. That was really good. Here. Your turn. Laura: You can hit it, ma. You'll hit it. Come on, ma. You can do it. You hit it, ma! You hit it better than anybody! That was great. All right. Let's go back to school. Uh... you needn't tell your father about this. Nellie reading: "Yes, dear children, "I wish to teach you the value of perseverance, "even when nothing more depends upon it than the flying of a kite. "Whenever you fail in your attempts to do any good thing, let your motto be try again." Miss beadle always gives me high grades in reading. She says I'm the best reader in the whole school. You did that very well. Sit down, please. Now, let's see, who will be next? Abel makay. Abel makay, will you read for us, please? Quiet! Abel? You do have a reader? Yes, ma'am. Pick it up and read for us, please. All right, quiet. Ma. Shh! All right, abel. We're waiting. Ma'am... Yes, abel. What is it? Quiet in here. Laura: Ma. He can't read. Not even one word. He doesn't come to school much. Mary: He ran away from miss beadle, too. After that, she didn't call on him. We tried to tell you. I don't know why everybody's making such a fuss. I know I didn't break my ankle. It's only sprained, but Dr. Baker won't listen to me. Caroline: So I won't listen to you either. You're just going to have to do as the doctor says. I know you're right. Well, at least I'm pleased to hear the children are in good hands. Good hands, indeed. I've lost one of your pupils already. You have? Abel makay. I didn't know he was backward, and I made the mistake of... Oh, no. Abel is not backward. He isn't? No. Well, I haven't had a chance to say more than a few words to him, but, well, I thought since he can't read at his age... I know. I thought so, too, but abel makay is as bright as any child in that classroom. Well, then why can't he read? Abel hadn't set foot inside a classroom until a month or so ago. Then he saw the children... 6, 7 years old... Starting to read, and, well, he was humiliated. He was embarrassed. And the other children laughed? Yes, they did. So he ran away. When he came back, I let him sit and listen, and I hoped he would gain confidence. And I ran him off again. Oh, you didn't know. Well, I should have guessed. Well... More tea? Mm-hmm. And one of those cookies, please. Well, you look fine. Mmm. The nelsons took good care of you. Come on. Well, how did the school teaching go? I failed badly. Mary: That's not so. She's a good teacher. Seems we have a little difference of opinion. You want to tell me about it? I lost the pupil that needed me most. But, ma, he's just dumb abel. What mo you say? I said... He was just dumb abel. Laura, I'm ashamed of you. It's just a nickname... What all the kids call him. Well, it's a cruel nickname, and the next one I hear use it, my child or any other, is going to get her mouth washed out with soap, the strongest soap I can find. You all must be starving. I better get supper. Whoa. I've already got supper on. Everything's cooking. All I have to do is set the table. Why don't you girls run inside and do that, huh? Both: Yes, pa. Bad day, huh? Practically the first thing I did, I asked him to read, and the other children laughed, and he ran out, didn't come back. Can't read? Not at all. Now, look, you can't blame yourself for that. Maybe he is backwards like the kids say. Maybe he can't learn. No. He can learn. He's only been in school a few days in his whole life. He's shy and embarrassed. The little ones know more than he does. He's not backward. He can learn. And as his teacher, it's my job to see that he does. And you will. You can't do everything in one day, you know. Wasn't a total loss. You hit a home run. Oh! They told you? Of course they told me. Whack! Right out of the schoolyard. You're laughing at me. Never. I'm proud of you. Thanks. Oh, well, good morning. Caroline: Good morning. I thought I'd bring the eggs in on my way to school. I'm not too early, am I? Oh, my goodness, no. Of course not. Well, now. Oh. These are so nice. The price is just going to have to go up... 4 cents a dozen. Thank you. Oh, Nellie and Willie are so pleased to have you as their teacher. They say so many nice things about you. They just wonder if there isn't more that they can do to please you. As a matter of fact, Nellie said to me this morning, "why, I could do so much more if only I can be her monitor." And then she could pass out the tests and collect the papers. I'm sure she'd be very good. Well, let's see. Fine. There you are. Plus 4 cents extra a dozen. Good. Well, it's all settled, then. Oh, I thought you knew. Knew what? The monitors jobs are kept for the children who don't like school and don't want to learn. It's a way of getting them interested. Of course, if your children feel that way... Oh, no. No. Well, for goodness' sakes, why, Nellie and Willie are quite bright, and they do like school. I'm sure it was... Well, I didn't know. Oh, well, of course, by all means, you give the monitoring job to someone who needs it. All right, then. I best be getting on. Morning. Morning. Good morning. Good morning. Children: Good morning. Morning. Here, Mrs. Ingalls. Thank you, Nellie. Have you seen abel makay? No. Ma. He didn't come today. All right. Go on inside. Hmm. Charles! Caroline. I'll be done in about 30, 40 minutes. We can ride home together. I sent the girls on ahead. I have to go out and see abel makay's father. Want me to ride out there with you? Well, it's my job. I better go by myself. All right. Why don't you go ahead and take the wagon? I'll meet you at the house. I may be a little late. Would you pick up Carrie? Charles: Sure. Thanks. Whoa. Giddy-up. Mr. Makay... I'm Mrs. Ingalls. I teach school over in walnut grove. I... Wanted to talk to you about your son. Uh, he didn't come in today. That's his affair. I don't hold much for schooling. I never went, never needed to. Make and sell the finest bricks. That's all a man needs. I have known men that did fine without schooling, but times are changing. Savvy... that's all it takes. Look around you here, ma'am. That is the finest Clay this side of the old country. I knew it when I found it. I staked it out, and it's mine. It's as good as a gold claim... Even better. I'm sure it is. I had the savvy to hunt for it and to know it when I found it. Whoa. That's all a man needs... Is savvy. I imagine your son has a lot of that savvy, too. He got it from me. It runs in the family. You put reading, writing, and arithmetic with that savvy, and you've got yourself a winner. Abel don't seem to learn nothing when he does go to that school. Besides, we got a heap of work to do here before the snow flies, or we'll go hungry this winter. Might be better if he stayed right here than go to that school and learn nothing. He'll learn if he comes back. I told you he can go back anytime he wants. Will you tell him he should come back, must come back? No, ma'am. You tell him. Then if he wants to go back, that's all well and good, but if he don't, then I'll thank you to leave him alone. Thank you. Giddy-up. Caroline: It's a promise, abel. You'll have to work, but I'll help you. In no time at all, you'll be reading words. I'm too old... Too big. No, you're not. Give yourself a chance. You'll see. You'll jump way ahead of the others. That's really good, abel. It was in the stick. When I see a stick, I see bones or something. This was a man. Here's something else. I cooked it to make it hard. My goodness. Abel, anyone with eyes to see like this can learn. You really think so? I know so. Caroline: All right, everybody. Come on. Come on. Let's settle down. Sit down right around here. Come on now. We're not up here for a picnic. We've got work to do. Hurry up, please. Sit down. All right, sweetie. Hurry back. Let's see now. Are we all here? Abel makay is not here. I know he's not here, Nellie. He won't be here until this afternoon. He's the reason we're all out here this morning. Willie: What'd he do? Caroline: Nothing. He just promised to be here this afternoon. Now I want to ask a question of all of you. Has abel makay ever harmed any of you? I guess not. No. No. No. No. No. Never did anything to me. The next question is, would you be willing to help abel? Girl: Why not? Yeah. Yeah. I knew you would. I didn't even really need to ask. Now, what we're going to do is, we're all of us going to be teachers. Would you like that? Children: Yeah! Sounds like fun. Instead of laughing at abel because he can't read, we're all going to work together to teach him to read. How does that sound? Sure. We'll help. You'll be surprised how quickly he'll learn with your help. Now, here's what we're going to do. All right. He's coming. Do you have your letters ready? Children: Yes, ma'am. Today we're having a review. We... Oh, abel. Sit down, please. The desk with the "t." Today we're having a review. We're going back to the fundamentals, back to the alphabet. Now, you're all making too many mistakes in your reading and your spelling because you're hurrying, and you're forgetting what you should have learned. When I call your name, stand up and hold up your letter. Tell us what the letter is and how it sounds. When the letters form a word, the person holding the last letter will tell us what the word is. All right. Do you understand? Children: Yes, ma'am. Let's try it. Harry. My letter is "d." Duh. Yes. Christy. My letter is "o." My sound is au. Laura. My letter is "g." My sound is guh. Duh-au-guh. Dog. Good. Sit down, please. Willie. My letter is "c." See. My sound is kuh. My sound is kuh. Sandy. My letter is "a." Ae. Aa. Aa. Abel. My letter is "t." My sound is tee. Caroline: Tuh. Tuh. Kuh-aa-tuh. Cat. Good. Sit down, please. Nellie. My letter is "b." My sound is buh. Sandy. My letter is "a." My sound is aa. Abel. My letter is "t." My sound is tuh. Buh-aa-tuh. Bat. Bat . Good. See you tomorrow, Jack. Laura: Hi, pa! Mary: Hi, pa! How you doing, girls? Fine. Caroline, I'm sorry I'm late. Had a big order to fill. How did it go today? Wonderful. I never had a better day. It worked, Charles. It really worked. Tomorrow... That's what I like to hear. Willie? Willie: "Frog." Harry. "Barn." Abel. "B... b... boat." Well, hmm. I declare, when my children came home and told me, I couldn't believe it. Believe what, Mrs. Oleson? Mrs. Oleson: This, exactly this... That you have stopped teaching the children to pamper your favorite, to baby one pupil, this... this... this... Dumb abel person here. Why, he shouldn't even be in school. Look at him. He's as big as I am. Children. Can any of you spell compassion? Can any of you spell understanding? Will any of you tell us the meanings of these words? Well, don't feel bad, children. I don't think Mrs. Oleson knows the meanings of these words either. Well, really! I happen to be a member of the board. School is dismissed, children. There will be no more school until another teacher is found. Whoa. I take it you're here to see my wife. Mr. Hanson: Where is she? Around the side of the house, there. Dr. Baker: Mrs. Ingalls. Mrs. Ingalls. Mrs. Ingalls, as you can see, we are here with our hats in our hands to beg you, please, to reconsider. We'd very much like you to go on teaching. I don't think I can. Well, we've heard, uh... What you might say conflicting reports. Would you tell us what happened? Would it be all right if I answer your question with another question? You bet you. You ask anything you want to. Suppose you were at work in your mill, grinding wheat into flour, making a special effort, and someone came in uninvited... I don't allow anyone in the grinding room when I am working. That is my rule. Suppose this person came in anyway, and while there, took a rock and threw it between the millstones and ruined all you were trying to do. I would take that person by the back of the collar and the seat of the pants, and I would throw him right out into the middle of the street! That idea did occur to me, but unhappily, I am a lady, and this person was also a lady. Is that what happened, like a rock between millstones? What I was trying to do was destroyed in much the same way. Do you want to tell them about it, Mrs. Oleson? Well, uh... It wasn't anything as serious as that. Really. I was... I was just, uh... Well, certainly a mother has a right to attend a school... Uh... Uh... well, all I did... Well, I mean, all I wanted to do was... To point out that one pupil shouldn't get special attention, uh, at the expense of the others. You interfered. Is that what happened? One of my pupils ran out. He was so humiliated. I don't think he'll ever come back. Oleson, would you take your wife by the back of... Would you take your wife and wait for us in the surrey, please? Oh. You've caused enough trouble. Come on. If we promise there will be no more interference, would you come back? I personally guarantee it. Now that I've lost the pupil who needs me most... I don't think I could be a good teacher. I'm sorry. Is that light bothering you? No. Not at all. This is really a good book. I'm reading a chapter right here tells you how to make your own paint. Are you going to paint tomorrow? No, I wasn't going to paint tomorrow. Then do you have to learn how to make paint tonight? The light is bothering you. It's just that it's been quite a day. I know. That whole school business has been kind of upsetting, hasn't it? I'm always upset when I lose my temper. Well, it's over now. It's all for the best. I probably never should have taken the job in the first place. I think you're right. It's for the best. Now, get some sleep. Charles: I saw Christy's father today. Oh, what about him? Oh, nothing. He just said there's going to be school tomorrow. Mrs. Oleson's going to teach. You can't be serious! Well, I'm just telling you what Christy's father told me. Well, Laura and Mary aren't going. What she has to teach, they don't need to learn. I agree. Good. If ever there was a person unfit to teach school, it is Mrs. Oleson. It's all my fault. I never should have lost my temper and quit. Caroline, you just got through telling me it was all for the best. Where Mrs. Oleson is concerned, nothing is for the best. Charles... Is there any popcorn left? Thanks. Good night. Good night. Well, look at you, Mrs. Ingalls. Pretty as a speckled bird. Thank you. I won't be long. Caroline! Just one thing. Remember, the eggs are for selling, not for throwing. Well, good morning, Mrs. Ingalls. How are you today? Fine, thank you. Yourself? Oh, never better. Never better. Well, what do I owe you for the eggs? Aren't you going to count them and price them? Mrs. Oleson always does. Well, she's not here today. She... Well, anyway, I'll take your word for the count and the price is the same as last time. You know I'm not teaching now. Well, what has that got to do with it? Mrs. Oleson seemed to feel it had something to do with the price. Oh, no. No, no, nothing like that, anyway not with me. All right, Mr. Oleson. You owe me 56 cents, and I'll spend it now. Ah. Didn't you tell the children that I was going to teach today? We did. That's the trouble. Abel! It's good to see you. What are you doing here? Waiting for you, Mrs. Ingalls. Mr. Ingalls told me you'd be coming this way. Well, fine. Let's sit down in the shade, shall we? It's getting warm, and I've been walking fast. What have you been doing with yourself? Well, I, uh... First I want to say I'm sorry for the way I run off. Oh, that's all right. I understand. The important thing is that you go back. Oh, I ain't goin' back. That's done, finished. I'm too old. It's no use. But, abel-. Ma'am, my mind's made up. What I done was... Well, you were so good to me, and I didn't work out. I wanted to make it up to you some way. I made something. Thought you could use it to help teach the other kids. It ain't that much, but... Abel... This is very good. You like it? I made a few up. I'll make the whole alphabet. I'll make the numbers, too, if you like. Abel, don't you see what's happened? In just the little time we had, letters and numbers have gotten into your head, and you're not ever going to be able to get them out again now, not ever. Well, what do you mean? You're caught, abel. You can't help yourself now. You're going to learn to read and write, and figure... And so many more things. But it's late, abel. You can't afford to waste another day. You've got to go back to school. Oh, no, ma'am. I can't do that. That's one thing I won't do. It's no use. That don't mean you can't take these letters, and... Yes, it does. Why? Because when you ran away, I ran away, too. You? Why? When I lost you, I decided I wasn't fit to be a teacher. But you are fit. What kind of a teacher am I if I can't keep the student that needs me most in school? Well, it's not your fault I'm dumb... Dumb abel. You're not dumb! Well, you're not a bad teacher. We have a problem, don't we? How are we going to solve it? I ain't goin' back. Well, I'm not going back. If I go back... Will you go back? Yes. Yes, yes! His... Try. Caroline: Mm. It's not exactly like that. His... To... Ry. History, isn't it? His... to... ry. History. Mm-hmm. Who can tell me the capital of the United States? Abel. The capital of the united states is Washington, D.C., but New York has more peop... population. Good. Hi. The girls will be ready in a minute. Well, it's your last day, teacher. Glad it's over? Yes. I can devote more time to my husband... And my children. But you enjoyed it. I had good days and bad days, but... yes, I enjoyed it. And you're going to miss it. Always... But only a little. Mary: Ma, we're ready. Better not be late for school. Bye, pa. Bye, pa. Children: B... D. Good morning. Mary: Good morning, miss beadle. Caroline: Sit down. Welcome back, miss beadle. Thank you, Mrs. Ingalls. Abel makay has something he would like to read for you. Miss beadle: Abel. "We want to thank you, Mrs. Ingalls. "You are a fine teacher and a good friend to us all."
