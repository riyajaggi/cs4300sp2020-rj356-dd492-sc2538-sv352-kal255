 Laura: Let's have a relay race! Boy: Let's choose sides. Boy: I choose Laura Ingalls. Hey, Laura. Laura, come on. I chose you. What about me? You're too fat to run. Boy: Give it to me! Hi. Hi. All that running made me thirsty.

 You run pretty good for a girl. Is it John Johnson? Is that your formal name? No, ma'am. It's Johnny. Johnny. Is it? Laura, voice-over: His name was Johnny Johnson. I knew just how he felt standing up there... Shy and scary, with everybody staring... Even worse than the first day Mary and I came to school, because he was all alone. Why don't you look at this book? Look at the first chapter. He looks like a scarecrow in somebody's garden. Miss beadle: All right.

 You can take this seat right here in front. All right. Miss beadle: Let's begin our day with reading. Patrick, would you like to start? Start right here. Patrick: "By sea and streams and fields and woods "the wild birds rear their little broods. "Look for their nest, but do not take. "Nests are such tiresome things to make. "What pretty love and tender care were spent "those warm nests to prepare. "Look and admire as well you may, but never take the eggs away." That's very good, Patrick. That deserves a gold star. Thank you, ma'am. Laura, I think you're next. Laura. Stop daydreaming. Miss beadle called on you. Want to start right here? "By sea and streams and fields and woods "the wild birds rear their little broods. "Look for their nest, but do not take. "Nests are such tiresome things to make. "What pretty love and tender care were spent "those warm nests to prepare. "Look and admire as well as you may, but never take the eggs away." That's very good, Laura. Come on, Laura. What a slowpoke you are today. I'm tired. You wouldn't be if you didn't play rough boys' games. Now what? I just want to see if there are any more initials on the sweetheart tree. Who cares? Carving on a tree is plain silly. I'd be furious if any boy put my initials up there. Come on. We've got chores and homework to do. I got a pebble in my shoe. Why, it's Johnny Johnson. I didn't know you lived out our way, Johnny. Yeah. I, uh... I take this road as far as the Morgan turnoff. We go farther, so we can walk together. Maybe he doesn't want to. This is my sister Mary. How do you do? I'm ready. Let's go. All right. You use a rope better than most any boy I ever saw. Ha ha ha! Well, I get lots of practice herding the stock to pasture and back. That's all you use... a rope? Ha ha! Of course not. I got a big stick to get after them with. Like miss beadle gets after some of the boys with her ruler. Ha ha ha! You know, uh... Miss beadle seems real nice. She said she'd help me all she could. You know, me being late starting and all. She will, too. And anybody who studies hard can go ahead just as fast as they can. Well, seems to me you did just about everything right today, Mary. You must study real hard. Ma taught Mary a lot before she started school. Our ma used to be a teacher. I want to be a teacher, too. Well, that's a mighty fine ambition. Golly, my mind's jumping like a jackrabbit from all the things miss beadle said today. Let's see who's the best rock thrower. All right. You go first. I'll try for that tree over yonder. Ha! You hit it! Very good. All right, Mary. Here. You go next. Oh, I'm no good at throwing rocks. Oh, go on. You never know when you're going to have to hit a varmint. Now, go on. Try that tree right over there. That's not bad, Mary. Not bad at all. But you're going to have to throw a little harder now. Here. See, now, you have to keep your arm straight. Come on. We got chores and homework to do. More music, papa! Caroline: It's time for you to dance to bed. Play one more song, pa. Please. Charles: My audience commands. I'll play one guaranteed to put Carrie to sleep. Ma... You have too much energy. Hmm? Would you tell me what it was like back in the olden days when you and pa were courting? I don't think I can remember that far back in history. You know what I mean. Did you know right off that you loved him? I think so. Did he know, too? I'm not sure. Your pa was never one for making sheep's eyes at girls. Why, he was so shy... I didn't even know if he liked me. Well, how'd you find out for sure? Well, I finally decided if I waited for him, I might never find out. So even though it was considered very forward for young ladies to do the asking, I invited him on a picnic. And what did he say? Uh, he said, uh... "Don't mind if I do," which wasn't exactly the response I was looking for. But on that picnic, we found out that we were kindred spirits. What's a kindred spirit? Well... That means you can read each other's thoughts without putting them into words. Good night, honey. Sleep tight. Good night, Carrie. Carrie: Good night. Mary? Go to sleep. What did you think of Johnny Johnson? Didn't think much of anything. He sure throws rocks good. Who wants to throw rocks? I think he's like pa. Why, he's downright homely compared to pa. I think he's the best-looking boy in the whole school. That's not saying much. Go to sleep, Laura. Can't. Have to go out back. Hey, isn't it about time you were in bed? I have to go to the outhouse, pa. Oh. That's different. Pa... would you tell me way, way back when ma asked you to go on a picnic, what did you think? Now, who told you about that? Ma told me. Oh, she did, did she? Mm-hmm. What did you think? Now, you promise not to tell? Cross my heart. All right. Well, I knew your ma would just die of a broken heart if I didn't go along, so I accepted and then hoped to heaven she was a good cook. You're teasing. No, I'm not. Didn't you ever hear the way to a man's heart is through his stomach? Hey. Falling star. Oh, I missed it. Well, I'll tell you what. I already have everything I want, so I'll give you my wish. But don't you have to see the star to get your wish? Mm-mm. I saw it, and I'm giving my wish to you. Oh. The way you're scrunching your eyes together, it must be a pretty important wish. Got it? Mm-hmm. Ok. You run on out back. But I don't have to go anymore, pa. Well, then you better get to bed. Oh, pa, I do love you. I love you, too. Off to bed. Have a good sleep. You, too, pa. Christy, your word is "puzzle." Puzzle, p-u-z-z-l, puzzle. I'm sorry. That's wrong. Mary? Puzzle, p-u-z-z-l-e, puzzle. That's correct. Nellie, your word is "whistle." Whistle, w-h-i-s-l-e, whistle. I'm sorry, Nellie. That's wrong. Mary? Whistle, w-h-i-s-t-l-e, whistle. That's correct. That makes you the winner for the week, and you get a gold star. Well, it's a few minutes early, but I think I'll dismiss the class anyway. Have a nice weekend, but not so nice that you forget to do your homework. - Johnny. - Yes, ma'am? I believe it's your turn to clean the blackboards. Yes, ma'am. Laura? Did you wish to speak to me about something? Well, I, uh... I wanted... I hope you have a good time, too. Thank you, Laura. Wait a minute, Mary. What? I remember I forgot something. I have to go back. Oh, fiddle. You really are a flutterbudget. I'll go with you. Oh, no. You don't have to come. You can wait here. I'll run all the way. We're having a picnic at cattail lake tomorrow. The fishing's real good. See you out there... Early! Oh. Don't worry, Johnny. I'm a good cook. Do you want to come? Don't mind if I do. Just like pa. Oh! You gave me a start, sneaking up on me like that. What do you mean, sneaking? Book of etiquette says when you're kissed by a man, you're supposed to kiss him back. Oh, it does? Yes. That's the Charles Ingalls book of etiquette. Hi, Jack! Oh, pa, thank you! For what, half-pint? For a wish that's come true. Don't look at me. She's your daughter. We've got to get that kerosene can refilled. Yes. Let's see. We need Navy beans... - All right. - Flour... Uh, salt, tea... And, uh, let's have a little white sugar. All finished, ma. Spick-and-span or just a lick and a promise? I even found that ribbon I lost. It was way, way under the bed. Where else would it be? Can I take along the oatmeal cookies? Certainly. You're really in a hurry this morning, half-pint. You say the fish bite best early. What are you going to use for bait... oatmeal cookies? 'Course not. Grubs and worms. It's an awful big lunch for one little girl. Well, fishing makes me real hungry. Bye, ma. Bye, pa. You be careful. What about the door? Johnny: Hey, there! Oh, hi! Hi. This is Jack. Hi, Jack. How you doing? He's a good one. My pa had to go into town, so I had some extra chores to do. That's all right. Gave me time to find some fat grubs. Yeah, I guess. Um... mary didn't wait, huh? No. She'd rather stay home with her nose in one of her schoolbooks. Ohh... You know, I reckon that's why she's so smart. You know, I bet she'll win that gold medal for the best student, don't you think? Now, if we don't get started, we won't even get a bite. Hey, you got one! Golly, Moses, Laura! That's the biggest one yet! Boy! Hey, that was really smart, the way you let him swallow up your bait rather than yanking on him really quick. Yeah. He's a big'un! Boy, Laura, you know, you ain't nothing like the other girls. I'm not? No! You're... You're different. You really think so, Johnny? Sure, I do. You know, I don't know any other girl in the whole school who can put a wiggly worm on the hook the way you do. What a pretty song... Squirrels playing and fish jumping. This is such a cheerful place. At times like this, I feel all warm and sparky inside. You ever feel that way, Johnny? Hey. It sure was good fishing. It was good lunch, too. Hey. You got any more of them fine oatmeal cookies left? You ate them all. Oh. Well, here's your catch, Laura. You want some of mine? Oh, no, no, no. It's just my pa and me. I think this is fine. Well, I got to be going. Bye-bye, Jack. Oh. Hey, Laura. Will you do me a favor? Sure! Will you tell Mary that if that Harry Baker keeps on pestering her that I'll be glad to teach him some manners, all right? Well, Harry pesters all the girls. He pesters me, too! Well, you ought to cuff him one on the ear then. I'll see you. Jack, you come back here! Laura, voice-over: It was a rotten picnic, not like ma finding out she and pa were kindred spirits who could read each other's thoughts. All that I learned about Johnny was that he could eat a lot of oatmeal cookies. Ma said you could tell each other's thoughts. Well, as much as any man can read any woman's thoughts, I guess. Can I ask a couple questions about what men think? Mm-hmm. Why not? Ma's smart. Do men like smart girls the best? Uh, some do. Some like them sweet and gentle. Some like them full of vinegar. Your ma's kind of all those things rolled into one. What did you like best about ma? Well, I think what I liked best about her was she knew when to be quiet and not ask a bunch of silly questions while a man was working. Just one more, pa. All right. One more. Did you like any other girls before you liked ma? Did you ever put yours and her initials on a sweetheart tree? Well, that's 2 questions, half-pint. As for the initialing, I don't think I did, although I would have if I would have thought of it. As for whether I liked any other girls, I wouldn't answer that question for you or your ma. Now, run along, let me finish Carrie's highchair, huh? Has Laura been asking you some funny questions lately? She asked me how we met, about our courtship. Well, I'll be darned. When I was out by the barn working, she was asking me the same kind of thing... What men like about women. - Really? - Yeah. Don't suppose she's got a little case of puppy love, do you? - Laura? - Mm-hmm. Well, Charles... I can remember chasing somebody when I was younger than Laura is. I even remember slowing down so you could catch me. Ha ha! You know... I thought what reverend Alden said about the missions in China was interesting. I hope he tells us more next Sunday. What did you think, Laura? I thought the sermon was too long. Well... why? Because my legs went to sleep. Hey, half-pint. If I have this fish trap finished by the time you get done collecting eggs, you can help me put it in the creek. Ok, pa. It's Johnny Johnson! Laura... Carrie's asleep. Well, if it isn't Johnny Johnson. Hey, I was just telling your pa here he don't need to work on that fish trap the way you catch fish, Laura. Want to help us set it up at the falls, Johnny? Well, hey, I'd sure like to. Good. Only I don't know if I can. Why not? Well... You see, I came here to ask a favor. What kind of favor? Well... You see, I'm getting really behind in these reading words, you know? And that makes the homework awfully hard. So I was figuring on maybe asking Mary to help some. You know, I mean, her wanting to be a teacher and all, maybe she wouldn't mind. If it's all right, that is. It's fine with me. You don't think she'd mind? I mean, you know, taking her away from her studying and all. Only one way to find out. Go on to the house and ask her. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. A nice boy. Why don't you cut me some more lengths of string, huh? Got to collect the eggs. Johnny: Hey, Mary. Mary! Oh, hi, Johnny. Hi. Mary, I was wondering if you'd help me with my reading words a little bit. Sure. Come on in. I'd appreciate it. Mind the mush, please, Mary. Mush meat, Mary. Yes, ma. - Ma? - Mm-hmm? Can I wear my blue Sunday ribbons to school today? Please, may I. Please, may I? Provided you remember to wear them home again. I will. Morning. Morning, pa. Charles: Morning, half-pint. Morning, pa. Wait a minute. I'll fetch the water, Mary. It's not your turn. Well, you'll have to owe me a turn sometime. After all, I am the fastest runner. We don't want to be late for school. First time we ever heard her fighting to do the chores. My favorite subject was recess. I can remember one time getting my knuckles rapped by the teacher during arithmetic. The problem was, "it is now 9:30. "Recess is at 10:45. How long is it till recess?" An hour and 15 minutes. That's correct. But my answer was "too long." Charles. I never said I was a good student. Laura: I fell in the creek. Laura! Are you hurt? I'm not hurt, ma. Here's the water. We didn't need quite that much water, half-pint. Now, you go on upstairs and get some dry clothes on. There's only your Sunday dress. I'll be careful of it, ma. You better. It's the only good dress you got. You're not to get it torn playing any rough-and-tumble games. Promise? I promise, ma. - There's ma! - There's ma! Mary: Ma! Did you come to visit school? No. I just came to say hello to miss beadle. How nice! Why don't you 2 girls run on and play? Recess is almost over now. Come sit up here. I gather this is more than a social visit. Uh, yes, it is. - Oh, this is lovely. - Thank you. Are you worried about Laura? Yes, I am. Yes. I am, too. She's such a good student, but lately... Well, she just hasn't been doing the kind of work she should be doing. She's distracted. She's inattentive. Boy struck'? I'm afraid so. Johnny Johnson? He's a new boy, started school a few days ago. He's a nice boy, but I'm afraid he's just not interested in Laura. He asked Mary to help him with his reading. Yes. Mary's been very polite and very helpful, but I'm afraid she's not interested in Johnny Johnson. I don't know if that makes the problem easier or more difficult. From what I can remember from my teaching days, these first loves are like a heat rash... Quickly come and quickly gone. I wouldn't worry about it. But if it will make you feel any better, I do intend to talk to Laura about her homework. Thank you, miss beadle. You're welcome, and don't worry. Harry, no! Somebody stop him! Hey, don't do that! He didn't do nothing to you! Johnny: Give me that! Give it back! It's mine! Johnny! Harry! Come in here this instant! Now see what you've done? You've got them both in trouble. Why didn't you just grab the slingshot instead of squealing for Johnny to take notice and come to your rescue? Well, if that isn't a pot calling the kettle black! You're the one always trying to get him to take notice. I don't give a hoot for your dumb old Johnny Johnson. He's not dumb! And just for that, you can walk home by yourself! Johnny: Hey, Laura! Hi. Thought you had to stay after school. Just to get my new reader. You finished the old one? - Yeah. - You sure are fast. Well, I couldn't have done it without Mary's help. She sure is a good teacher. Come on. Let's catch up and tell her. Well, ain't you coming? Is something wrong? Just tuckered. Aw. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, Mary! Wait a minute! No pictures. Letters. Pictures. No, Carrie. We're going to make letters now. - Pictures. - Letters! - Pictures! - Letters! Let her draw! Why do you always have to spoil everything anyway? I don't know what you're talking about. You do, too. We used to always have fun walking home. Now all you do is show off playing teacher. Don't be silly. I'm not being silly. And you're two-faced, Mary Ingalls, saying one thing behind Johnny's back and acting another to his face! It wasn't my idea to play teacher. It was his! You're just a foolish... Shut up! You just shut up! Laura! I don't want you to speak to your sister that way, nor to anyone else! All right. Now, what's this all about? Just a little argument. Well, nothing is solved by shutting off the other person's argument. Now, Laura, I want you to hear your sister out. Laura? I sent the girls outside... So we can have a private talk. Saying what's right isn't taking anybody's part. Now, I'm going to tell you just what I told Mary. Quarrels would never last long if there was only one person at fault. I want you both to think on that and to make up. Yes, ma. What's really bothering you? Nothing. Honest. That's not honest, Laura. Do you think you're the only little girl who ever felt this way? Both your pa and I felt just as you do once. But everything was working out fine when you and pa were courting. No. I mean earlier, before that, when we were younger, when we were your age. We had our share of heartaches. Well, it's hard thinking of you and pa little. I suppose it is... But the farther you get away from it, why, we can even look back now and laugh, just as you will be able to laugh at this one day. You'll see. It's all part of growing up to be a woman. I don't think I want to grow up to be a woman. - It hurts. - Oh! Well, nobody grows up all the way. There's a little girl inside every woman, just as there's a woman inside every little girl. And you mustn't be afraid to hurt because that's a part of life. Hurt is something to measure happiness by. It's like valleys and mountain peaks. Without them both, the world would be flat and uninteresting. With me it's all valleys. I keep trying to think of ways to make Johnny like me better, but none of them seem to work. Honey, one of the biggest mistakes that people make is trying to change themselves so that somebody else will like them. In a way, that's a kind of a lie. Deep down inside of all of us there's a sense of trueness telling us who we really are. Both your pa and I want you to be your own true self because we love you, Laura. I remember he liked me the best the first day. He said I was a pretty good runner. Good. Now, will you come down and give me a hand with supper? - Ma? - Hmm? I jumped in the creek. I know that. She was just as cute as she could be, trying to figure out ways to get that boy to like her, and all the time, he was smitten with Mary. I thought he just wanted Mary to help him with his reading. Oh, that was just an excuse. How old is he? I don't know. 14, 15. Well, why doesn't he get miss beadle to help him? That's what she's there for. Mary was just trying to be nice. Well, I don't like it. Why, Charles Ingalls! You said yourself what a nice boy he is. Well, that's when I thought he was a boy! He's 15 years old, Caroline. That's not a boy anymore. That's a man. You know what a fella's like when he's 15 years old? No, Charles. You tell me. What were you like when you were 15? Go see to the stock. I know it looks difficult, but just think it through. You can do it. That's right. Meet me by the sweetheart tree. What? After school, meet me by the sweetheart tree. Oh, yes. Hi. Sure is a beautiful old tree, isn't it? Yeah... sure is. Must be, oh... A hundred years old, don't you think? I guess. Are there rings inside to tell for sure? Oh... ha! I suppose. I don't know much about trees. How many names do you figure are on it? Oh... Looks like a whole mess. Some boys do it in secret. Well, I reckon it's because they're scared. But you're not scared. You asked me right out to meet you here. Yeah. Well... You're different, Laura. I know. I'm a pretty good runner for a girl. I'm not fussy about putting wiggly old worms on hooks. No. It's... It's more than that. You seem... Well, a fella can... Can say things to you that... Well, he'd be kind of embarrassed to say to somebody else, you know? You seem to understand the way I feel. Kindred spirits. Show me what you carved, Johnny. Please? All right. Well, what do you think? I figured you could tell me, you being so close to her and all. How do you think she'll like it? Laura! Caroline, you sure have a way with buffalofish. Never did understand where they got so many funny names for fish... Buffalofish, catfish... Even butterfish. Well, I can tell you where they got the name bullhead. Now, that's the stubbornest fish I ever did try to catch. Caroline: Heh. How was school today? It was fine, pa. Mary: Not for me. I'll be the laughingstock of every girl in school tomorrow, all because of that numskull Johnny Johnson. Caroline: What on earth? Why, he seemed like such a nice lad. He sneaked off and put my name on the sweetheart tree for everybody to gape at. "Johnny loves Mary." And I don't even like him! Willie's right. He looks like a scarecrow, and he's addlebrained, as well. How could you be so mean? He's the best runner and roper in the whole school! You're the numskull! Why don't you let me go? Sometimes when you lose one man, it helps to talk to another one. It's not fair, pa. She doesn't care a hoot about him, and it's her name he put on the tree. I could have died. It was the most tragical thing that ever happened in my whole life. Kind of like that time we lost that old dog Jack, huh? Jack found us again. And Johnny will find you again. You think he will? Why, sure, he will. You know, I remember when I was a boy, I knew this little gal. She had pigtails and freckles. She was about 4 years younger than me, which is like a hundred when you're 15. Johnny's 15. Yeah. I used to call her "tagalong" because she was always chasing after me all the time. I didn't pay her any mind. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed a whole bunch of boys buzzing around her like bees to honey. I took a good look at her, and I realized that she had blossomed into about the prettiest thing I'd ever seen. I figured she'd take to me right off but she couldn't see me for dust. Her name was Caroline. Ma? Ma. And you're just like her. Just like her. You wait and see. One of these days you're going to have lots of beaus. I wouldn't be surprised if Johnny Johnson's one of them, sweet thing. I'm not a sweet thing, pa. I blamed it all on Mary, and it wasn't even her fault. I said wicked things to her on purpose. I meant to be hurtful, but it didn't stop my hurting. Well, you learned a lesson. Hurting back doesn't help. There's lot of ways to make amends. I guess I was jealous. Oh, so was I. You, pa? Mm-hmm. Some young sprout was trying to steal my best girl. Oh, pa! I love you. Now... If you're going to grow up to be as pretty as your ma, I think we ought to get you home and give you some supper. Ha ha!
