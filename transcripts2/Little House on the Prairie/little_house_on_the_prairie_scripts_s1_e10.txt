 Blaming herself when Laura's doll breaks during a game of catch, Mary is delighted to give her sad, little sister an abandoned, baby raccoon. After Pa reluctantly agrees to let her keep him, Laura names him "Jasper", teaches him tricks and tries to keep the mischief-maker out of trouble. But one day, Jasper bites Jack, the Ingalls' dog, and disappears into the woods. When Charles later shoots a snarling, rabid raccoon who is killing the chickens and begins to watch Jack for signs of rabies, a tearful Mary reveals a terrible secret... Jasper had also bitten Laura who made Mary promise not to tell.

 Mary: Bring it here, Jack. Come on. Bring it here. Good dog. Hey, Laura, you want to play ball with me? Laura: Uh, I was just gonna play tea party with Janet. You can play afterwards. All right. I guess Janet won't mind. Good, because I need to practice. You sure look scrumptious. Now, you wait right there. Be right back. Mary: Sorry. You have to aim better.

 That's why I want to play. So the next time we have a party and play 3 old cat, I won't miss so many. Come on. Throw it right over the plate. Are you all right? She's all broken. I feel like I've killed her. I'm sorry. It was my fault, Laura. I threw the ball. She's an unhappy girl. Well, I'm afraid she's gonna be just as unhappy tomorrow. There's no way I'm gonna be able to put this thing together. The big pieces are easy,

 but some of them are just as small as pieces of dust. Mary feels just as bad. She threw the ball. Yeah, it was just an accident. Charles... Do you think we could afford to... I'm sorry, Caroline, I can't. It's... It's the winter money. There's never enough. I know. You know I wish I could. Of course I do. They'll get over it. Charles, these two fit. That's very good, Caroline. Here. Why don't you try some of these? Two biggest pieces you picked. Man: Here we are. Bisque doll heads. Yes, I can order one, but they ask a sight of money. How much? Well, with movable eyes... That's the best grade... $1.20. Do they have one for 11 cents? 59 and 69. That's the cheapest. Sorry I troubled you. No. I'm sorry I couldn't help. Thank you, Mr. Oleson. Jack, what are you doing way out here? Stop that! Jack, stop it! If you've flushed anther skunk... Oh, my. Poor little baby. Lost your mama? Laura: Oh, it's the nicest, nicest little fellow. Can I really have it? Mm-hmm. I brought it home just for you. But I'll share it. I promise. You want to pet it, Carrie? Nicely. Oh... boy. He's the best thing I ever had. I'm gonna put a big ribbon around his neck. And he can have my pillow. You're not gonna take him to bed? Why, sure. See how gentle he is, ma? I can keep him in my bed, can't I? I think not. Well, he's never lived in a house. He, uh, he doesn't know his manners. He might get into mischief. Well, I'll look after him, and I'll clean up after him. And I even have a name for him. I'll call him Jasper. Please, ma? We'll see. Looks like he's in a good mood. Charles: Hi, everybody. Hi, pa. Where'd you get the raccoon? Laura: Mary gave him to me. I found him out in the woods. I'm gonna make a pet out of it. I'm sorry, half-pint. That wouldn't work. I gave it to her, pa, so she wouldn't miss her doll so much. Well, it just wouldn't work. That animal's not a kitten or a puppy dog. He's wild. He's got no more place lmng in a house than you'd have lmng in a wolf den. Doesn't make sense trying to make a pet out of an animal that was born to run loose. But, pa, look how gentle he is. I wouldn't have brought him home for Laura if he was wild. Mary, he's gentle now because he's a baby. You wait a little while, that animal will be as big as a dog and nowhere near as reliable. A raccoon like that could really hurt somebody. Well, if he grew up with us, he'd be tame. Half-pint, if he was tame, he'd be the first tame raccoon I've ever seen, and I've seen an awful lot of them. No more arguing about it. Just take him outside and play with him for a little while and then turn him loose, back in the woods where he belongs. Pa, he's just a baby. Like Carrie. Laura: You wouldn't leave Carrie out in the woods, would you? Caroline: Now, that was a silly thing to say. You've given your father enough bother. Now, do as he says. Go on. Take him outside. I'm sorry, Laura. I never thought pa would say no. Think I was wrong? No. I think what you said was very sensible. But you would just as soon I wouldn't be so sensible this time? Well, it's just that Laura's been missing her doll so much... All right. Can't have my women thinking I'm the meanest man in Minnesota. But she's only gonna keep it for a little while. Thank you. All right, you can keep the raccoon. Thanks, pa! Thanks, pa! Hear that, Jasper? You're gonna be my pet. Now, hold on. He's not gonna be a pet. You're just gonna tend to him till he's big enough to take care of himself, and that's gonna be a lot sooner than you think. Let's take Jasper up to our room, Laura. Hold on. He's not going in the house. Well, Jack goes in the house. Well, I think Jack's a little bit different. He's gonna stay in the barn. You like him, don't you, pa? And you'll like him even more. He'll grow on you. Wait and see. Oh, he's gonna grow, that's for sure. Now, why don't you put him out in the barn. Yes, pa. Come on, Jasper. Jasper. Jasper. Kissy. Yeah. You gonna give me kisses? Hmm? There. It's nice and warm and dry. Jasper should be very happy here. He liked it better in our room. Laura, pa said he has to stay... I know pa said. Jack, hush. Yeah, that's my little baby. Yeah. Kissy? You gonna give me some kisses? Now, where's half-pint? She'd better hurry up. She's gonna be late for school.- she's outside. With Jasper? Yes. Today's the day Jasper's going to school. What are you gonna do... teach him to read and write now? Laura's talked so much about him, all the other kids want to see him. Miss beadle said she could bring him, huh? She said she'd like to see Jasper, too. Stand up and ask for your breakfast. That's it. Ask for it like a good boy. Isn't that special? Jack can do that. A dog's supposed to. Come on. We'll be late for school. Wait. Let me practice it one more time. All right. Jasper, quit that. Hey. Ok. Stand up. Jasper, stand up. He does it better when I have an egg. Ma sells every extra egg. We don't have any to waste on him. Well, that was my lunch egg I just fed him. Ma gave me an extra one so he'll stand up in school. Come on. Come on, Jasper. Come on. Laura: Come on, Jasper. Jack, stop it! Jack, go home! Go home! Jack, stop it! Jack, come back here! Jack, stay! Jack, stop it! Laura: Jack, you stay. You're a bad dog, Jack. Mary: He just wants to come with us. They didn't ask to see a dog. Come on, Jasper. Jasper, come on. Jasper, come on. You'll like school. It's all right. Come on. You won't be... Don't be scared. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Come on. That's a boy. Now, children, we've all seen raccoons before, but can anyone tell me what they eat? Girl: Fruit? Mm-hmm. Boy: Bugs? Girl: Fish. They eat fish. Boy: Birds and eggs. Fruit, fish, birds, and eggs. Mm-hmm. Boy: And bugs. Boy: And toes! And bugs. Is that right, Laura? That's correct. Except for bugs. Also, raccoons eat meat. Toes are meat. Willie... We have raccoons around our place all the time. Nothing so special about them. Jasper's trained. That makes him special. I quite agree, Laura. Would you like to see Jasper eat an egg? Children: Oh, yeah! Yes, very much. That's amazing. My dog can roll over and play dead. Laura, you've done a remarkable job of training a wild animal. Thank you, miss beadle. Now, children, I'd like you all to be thinking about your assignment for tomorrow, which will be to write an essay on what kind of wild animal you would like to have for a pet. School is dismissed. Laura, can I hold it? Me, too! Yeah! Yeah! Laura: You're scaring him. Children, please be careful. He could bite. Boy: See, I told you. He eats toes and fingers, too. Laura: That's not so! Jasper never bites. Charles: Hey, where are you going, half-pint? Say good-bye to Jasper. Well, hurry up. I don't want you to be late for church. Sorry, Jasper. You can't go with me today. They don't allow raccoons in church. If you hide your eyes, I'll give you an egg. Hide your eyes. Good boy. You be a good boy, Jasper. Bye! Laura: Bye, Jasper! Laura: Pa, how many baby raccoons do raccoons have when raccoons have baby raccoons? I don't know, half-pint. It all depends. 2, 3, maybe 4, I guess. Mary: Why do you want to know? Laura: Well, Nellie oleson wants a baby raccoon, and I bet all the other kids do, too. Mary: So? Laura: What I was thinking is, if I had baby raccoons, I could sell them to the other kids and make lots of money. That's pretty hard to do. Jasper's a boy raccoon. Charles: Whoa! Hey, be quiet, Jack, we'll let you in. What's the matter? Laura: Jack, what's the matter? Charles: Must smell that good pie you made. All right, that's it. That raccoon is gonna go! This may take a while. You're a bad boy, Jasper. Sneaking into the house and spilling all that food like you did. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'm sorry, half-pint. That's it. Laura: What are you gonna do, pa? Charles: I'm taking him back to the woods. But, pa, he's just a baby. He can't take care of himself. Don't argue, and don't start crying. He's going back to the woods. My mind's made up. Whoa. Here we go, Jasper. Back in the ol' woods, eh? Come on. Out you go. Ha ha! Off with you. He got lonesome out there, pa. He didn't know anyone. I'm the only mommy he's got. What are you gonna do, pa? I'm gonna build him a cage. Laura: Get back! Mary, would you hold Jack, please? Laura: Hi, Jasper. Hello. Jack, be quiet. Mary, would you tell him to be quiet. He's scaring Jasper. Stop it! Stop it! Jasper, get back there. Get back. Get back. It's ok, Jasper. I won't let Jack hurt you. That's a boy. Jack, be quiet. Don't do that! It's ok, Jasper. Here you go. Ow! He bit me! Oh, Laura, let me see! Jasper, leave Jack alone! Mary: Jack! Laura: Stop it! Mary: Jack, stop it! Oh, Jack. Laura: Jasper? Jasper? He bit Jack. Laura: It's just a little nip. Like he gave me. Jasper turned wild. Jasper didn't turn wild. He was just upset is all. Being caged... And Jack barking at him, trying to make him fight. Well... he's gone now. But he'll come back. He better not. When pa finds out he bit you and Jack, he'll really be mad. Mary, don't tell pa. Laura, we have to. It's just a little scratch. It's a bite. Doesn't hurt hardly at all. Besides, look at Jack. He isn't hurting. Mary... If we tell pa, he won't let me keep Jasper when he comes back. Laura, it's not right not to tell. Do you want me to lose Jasper? I think you already did. He'll come back. I know he will. Mary, please? But.. Oh... All right. Thanks, Mary. I'll just tell pa that I opened the cage and Jasper ran off, and that's the truth. Bye. Laura: Jasper! Jasper, where are you? Jasper! Jasper! Jack, you go home! Jasper! Where are you? Oh, Jasper. Why did you have to go? So sweet... Oh, yes. Charles: Mmm. Time for bed, huh? Good night. Carrie: Good night, pa. Have a good dream. Good night, Carrie. Hey, Jack. How you doing? What are you doing up on that table, huh? Hey, half-pint, where have you been hiding yourself? I didn't see you all afternoon. I've been out looking for Jasper. Well, I'm afraid you're not going to find him. But he came back before. He must have got lost this time. Half-pint, I really think he's decided he wants to live in the woods. Now, I know you feel bad, but... Hey, you got your best friend, your old dog Jack, right here. It's all his fault Jasper's gone. It wasn't Jack's fault. Jasper bit him! Laura: Mary Ingalls, you promised not to tell. Now, hold on a minute. What's this all about? When did that happen? When Jasper ran off. Charles: I'm gonna tell you, Laura Ingalls, Jack was lucky. Now, a raccoon like that could tear a dog apart. Look, I know you feel bad, but it's better for everybody. It's better for us, and it's better for Jasper. Now, you go on, finish your homework. Yes, sir. Go on, Mary, finish yours. Laura, whispering: Jack, shhh! Mary: Quiet, Jack! We're trying to sleep! Laura: Be quiet! Will you be quiet?! Charles: I don't know. Stay here. Come on, Jack. Caroline, go back! Come on. Laura! Charles: Laura, go with your mother. I know it's a sorrowful thing, half-pint. I didn't want to do it. I just didn't have any choice. It's all my fault. I'm the one who fed Jasper the eggs. I spoiled him on eggs. That's why he came. Charles: Hey, now, hold on, now. It's... It's not your fault. Now, you think that's the first raccoon that ever went after a chicken? It's in his nature, half-pint. Nothing he could do about it. Nothing you could do about it. There's nobody to blame. It's all my fault. Aw... You were right. You were right. She's asleep. You all right? Stay there! What's the matter? The raccoon was rabid. That's why I buried him and the chicken so fast. I didn't want anyone to touch them. Caroline: Why are you tying Jack up? Mary told me that night that the raccoon bit Jack. I found the wound. He drew blood. Mary: Here, chicky-chick-chick. Move over. I got to get the eggs. Now, what are you doing in there? Jack, who did that to you? Who tied you up? Mary. Now, leave him be. Well, why? What's he done? He hasn't done anything yet. I didn't want to say anything last night, but there's a chance that he may have rabies. We're not gonna know for a while. Not for sure, so... Till we do, I don't want you or Laura or Carrie to go near him. All right? You mean... Because Jasper bit Jack? Charles: That's right. But it wasn't much of a bite. It doesn't have to be. He broke the skin. That's all it takes. Pa... Can people get the rabies from a bite? Yeah. That's why I don't want you to go near the dog. Oh, pa! Shhh... Oh! “O! “O; “O, no. Shh. Laura... What about her? What about her?! Jasper bit Laura. Why didn't you say something? Why didn't you tell me? I made a promise. I promised her... Because she wanted Jasper to come back. What's the matter, Mary? Oh, nothing. Don't worry. 4 days ago, you say? Charles: That's right, doc. Well, then, we'd better start treatment immediately. One gumdrop, to be taken internally. Thank you. And I don't have to take any medicine? For a little bite like that? No. Just rest in bed for a couple of days. That's my prescription. Dr. Baker's magic formula. Now, why don't you take these out to your sisters to keep peace in the family, while I have a chat with your folks. I haven't seen them for quite a spell. Caroline: Bundle up. Laura: Thank you, doctor. Doctor, does she? It's too early to tell, Mrs. Ingalls. How long before we know? Watch the dog. Hydrophobia in a dog runs its course from start to finish in about 8 days. The incubation period for a girl Laura's age is anywhere from 3 weeks to a month. If the dog doesn't develop rabies, chances are Laura won't. Well, if, um... If worse comes to worst, what kind of treatment will you give her? There is no treatment. There, you see? This isn't gonna be so bad. You get to lie in bed and be waited on, and Mary's gonna do all your chores. How would you like a glass of warm milk with cinnamon? Ma? Mm-hmm? What's going to happen to me? Nothing. You're just going to stay in bed and get a lot of rest. I'll... I'll get your milk. It isn't true, is it, pa? I want to know. You want to know, then I'm just gonna have to tell you, all right? A raccoon bite's a pretty serious thing. First thing happens, you start getting these big black circles around your eyes. And then your ears get all pointy, and they stick up like that. And you get an awful craving for raw eggs. Pa, you're teasing. I guess I am. Because you don't want me to know. That's why Dr. Baker sent me out of his office, so I couldn't hear what he said. No. We just had some things we wanted to talk over with the doc, that's all. Jasper was sick when he bit Jack. That's why he's tied up. You're afraid he's gonna get sick. There's a chance he might be a little sick, yeah. And me. Am I gonna get sick, too? Half-pint, I don't know. I... I just pray to god you don't. Don't worry, pa. We'll be all right. Water. Drink. Milk. Cool. Orange juice. Water. "What prettiness, what whispering wings. "What happy, feathered flying things. Between green fields and sunny sky..." Caroline: Uh... Sky. Laura: Cloud. "Between green fields and sunny sky, I wish we, too, could learn to fly." Laura? What? Do you hate me? I wouldn't blame you if you did. Why should I hate you? You're my sister. About the worst sister anybody ever had. Mary... Well, look what I did. I'm the one who brought Jasper home in the first place. Remember? But I wanted him. And I didn't tell pa he bit you when I should have. And then I did tell pa after I promised I wouldn't. You didn't tell pa because I asked you not to. And that's being good to me. Then I broke my promise to you. A promise is a promise, you know. But you had to tell pa so he would know if I was going to get sick or not. I'm just not a good sister. You are, too, Mary. You're the very best sister. I couldn't hate you. Mary, I love you. Oh, come on, it's all right. It's just the waiting. Everything's gonna be all right. Mary: Ma? Laura's thirsty. The doctor said it's a sign! It's not a sign! The child is just thirsty. It's not a sign. I'll fetch some water. How you feeling, half-pint? Not so thirsty anymore. Just tired. Just lie down. Charles: Stay up here. Oh, there, there, there. Jasper. Jasper! Jasper! Caroline! It's all right! Caroline: What? Why? It's all right. Everything's all right. There were two raccoons. The one that killed the chickens... it wasn't Jasper. No? That's Jasper out there now. He sat up and begged. It was the prettiest sight I ever saw. You're all right. My baby's all right. Then Jack's all right? Half-pint, Jack is just beautiful. Why don't you go out and untie him. Jack! Jack! Oh! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Yes!
