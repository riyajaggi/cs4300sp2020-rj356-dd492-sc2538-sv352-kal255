 Fenton is annoyed when Briggs shows leniency to gay men pulled in following a raid on an underground homosexual bar. However Briggs is himself gay and, whilst he is married, he begins to resume his relationship with former lover Carl. Max links Powell to both Maddock and Rebecca and gives him a warning visit. Later Fenton tells Powell he can no longer cover for him. Rosie, the brothel madam and sometime mistress of Fenton, helps Rebecca escape but Max apprehends her at the train station.

 I-I... I can tell you're a man who appreciates a woman of experience. It wasn't suicide, it was murder. Get off me! You stupid mare! Who is this Lenny Powell? Someone to steer clear of. Now, Mike "The Mallet" Maddock! I managed to get these at the club. That's Rebecca Jones. I need you - now. Maddock! Maddock! You'll give it up soon enough.

 Oh... I think you belong here. What's your name? Sid. Tobias. How come I haven't seen you here before? You can't be too careful. I steer clear of places like this. But... not tonight. No, not tonight. Crap week. Do you want to, uh... talk about it? I've got a wife for that. Good. I thought it was going to be a long night. I prefer to, uh... cut to the chase. So do I. HANDCUFFS RATTLE You're under arrest. Everybody, this is a raid, don't move anywhere! WHISTLE BLOWS It looks like it's going to be a long night after all, sweetheart. What do you think of the chicken? Hmm? It's curried. Ah! Very nice. Good. Walter, I've been thinking about the money Daddy left me and... I'd like a new kitchen. All right. Whatever you think. Good. We moved back to Brinford so you wouldn't have to work so hard, and I'd like to make a change too. Of course. It would be good for us to spend some more time together. Yes, it would. Maybe... we could try again for a baby. Charlotte... No, it's all right, I won't get my hopes up this time. I'm just... ..not ready to give up. Not just yet. So... ..a new kitchen. Sorry about that, sir. It won't happen again. I won't be coming back here again. Is everything all right? He didn't fancy paying for a tart who starts crying in the middle of it. Some people are picky like that. That girl better start earning her keep, or there's going to be a problem. All right, I'll handle it. And no need to tell Mr Powell. Watch out, lads, they might start enjoying it! What's this? Eh? Poor cow, sitting at home. If she knew what you'd been up to. This one's married too, Sarge. You're a disgrace! The lot of you! Why don't you just leave us alone? Maybe we would. If you left each other alone. Come on, get 'em out to the vans! What, all of them, Sarge? Yes, all of them! Move! Don't make me do this any more. Please, Rosie, I can't bear it. Just let me go. I won't tell anyone what I've seen, not ever. You know I can't do that. Why not? You owe Mr Powell a lot of money. This is how he wants you to repay it. But it's not even my debt. Daniel bought you nice things, didn't he? Where do you think all that came from? That's not fair. I didn't do anything wrong, and you know it. If you don't let me go, I'll kill myself, I swear. No, you won't. I will. Come on. You used to sweet-talk the men at the club, didn't you? Well, this is just like that. It's all an act. It wasn't with Daniel. Now you listen to me - forget about Daniel. If you don't get your head straight, you'll end up just like he did. Is that what you want? No. Good. Take the rest of the night off. But tomorrow you get back to work, understood? This is police persecution - eight men to a cell all night? I'm sure you boys made the most of it. Sit! You do realise you're facing quite a serious charge? Since when is it a crime to have a drink? There's a lot of pubs in Brinford, Mr Saunders. You just... happened to visit one full of homosexuals? I didn't know it was that kind of place. Look, I'm serious. Lizzy Maddock, 13 years old. Lives on Ackerman Street? She was taken into care yesterday with two of her sisters. Right. OK. Thank you. So... you're a school teacher. That's right. Not any more, you ain't. Sergeant Fenton. A word, please, my office. Sir! Don't go anywhere. Sir. Close the door. Tell me, what was the purpose of keeping those men in the cells overnight? They're queers, sir. I am aware of that, Sergeant - who do you think authorised the raid? But I didn't expect you to arrest everyone in the place. Maybe when they have to explain to their wives where they've been all night, they may think twice. Ah, so this is a moral crusade, is it? We can't have them carrying on under our noses, sir. And I'm sure they got that message loud and clear. Now release them all with a caution and place your attentions elsewhere. We've got enough to charge Tobias Hunt with importuning. He's a pervert, sir, he had his hands on me. All right. But let the others go, it's like... Piccadilly Circus out there. Yes, sir. Right... ladies! This is your lucky day. You are free to go. Not so fast. Take this one back to the cells. What? Well, how come they all get to leave? Because they weren't stupid enough to touch up a copper, were they? And next time, you lot won't get off so easy! You can stay too if you like. I'm still missing your paperwork from yesterday. I'll get on it n-n-n-now, Sarge. What's all this? Those are from before. Some of these are a week old! Tommy, son, you're not weaving a tapestry. Get a wiggle on! I want these on my desk by the end of the day, right? Yes, Sarge, sorry. B-B-Back to work! Sergeant Fenton, can I pick your brains for a sec? There's a name that keeps popping up everywhere I look - Lenny Powell. What about him? Councillor Pembrook was in debt to him, and it turns out he sponsors boxers too, including our unfortunate friend, Mike Maddock. So I've been doing some digging. He's got quite a record - trading on the black market in the war, armed robbery, assault. Everyone knows that. All right. But I'm guessing you know more than most. Why would I? Because you're good at your job. Nobody's been able to touch him since the old days. As far as anyone can see, he's a respectable businessman. He makes a big show out of being reformed, donates to charity, cuts ribbons for the mayor. The best place to hide is in plain sight. What do you say we go pay him a visit? Nothing like seeing the boys in blue to rattle a legitimate businessman. Miss Nightingale, have you seen... my notes? So you chased the bag thief all the way down the high street through the covered market? You're so brave. He was 12. Oh. Still, you caught him. That takes some doing. I suppose. Can I have them back, please? I have to type it all up. Ah! Leave it with me, I'll have them done in half the time. I don't know... Sergeant Swift wouldn't like it. Who's going to tell him? Ever get the feeling we're in the wrong job? I'm going to shoot you, I'm going to shoot you! Morning, officers! Come here, come on. Hey, listen... You see these two men? They're real-life sheriffs, hmm? So you better behave yourselves. Sergeant...? Fenton. And I don't think we've had the pleasure. DI Harper. This is my wife, Laura. Hello. Mrs Powell. Sweetheart, get 'em a Scotch on ice, would you? Not for us, thank you. We're on duty. Come on, boys, let's leave Daddy to talk. You have a beautiful family. Oh, thank you. We won't take up much of your time. We just have a few questions. Fire away. We believe you were acquainted with the boxer Mike Maddock. It's no secret I sponsored him, he was a hell of a fighter. So you've heard what happened to him. I read the papers, Detective. It's a tragedy. When was the last time you saw him? Just after the fight. I invited him out to celebrate his victory, but he was anxious to return to his children. How are they, by the way? As you might expect... under the circumstances. Well, I hope you find whoever's responsible. Oh, don't worry. We will. So you're a copper. You kept that one quiet. I'm sorry, do I know you? Oh, you know me, all right. Rather intimately, if I recall. Keep your voice down. The Crown. Take a different route. It must be unnerving to have so many of your friends meet with misfortune. We understand you also knew Daniel Pembrook. The councillor? Where did you hear that? Your weekly poker games are an open secret, Mr Powell. We play for matchsticks, of course. Of course. And I assure you Councillor Pembrook never attended. I've never even met the man. Really? We were under the impression he'd racked up quite a poker debt to you. I imagine it makes you angry when people don't pay what they owe. I think I can afford to be lenient, don't you? I'm sure Mike Maddock would disagree. Are you implying he owed me money? No, but I'm guessing money had something to do with it. I doubt you'd dispose of someone who was... still of use to you. You're right, I wouldn't. And since Maddock won his last fight, you'll know he was a valuable asset. Was? He's not dead yet, Mr Powell. I guess some people just refuse to stay down. You have a good day. Thanks for stopping by. Always a pleasure. Are you going to buy me a drink? It's a bit of a fleapit. What do you want, Carl? You should be a bit nicer to me. Unless you want to read about our last encounter in the morning papers. I reckon we could even make the headlines. I could arrest you right now, for blackmailing a police officer. Go ahead. What would it be like, I wonder? For a police officer in prison? I'll ask you again, what do you want? £100. I don't have it. You've got a problem then, haven't you? Why are you doing this? You were released today without charge. I stuck my neck out for you. You didn't do it for me. You were scared I'd talk, that's all. That's not true. I do what I can for... people like us. Don't you dare sit there and pretend like we're on the same side. Your lot make our lives a misery. Well, you know what? Now it's your turn. Have the money by tomorrow. What? That's absurd - how am I supposed to get it? You'll figure something out. Yeah, Sarge. OK? Sir. WPC Dawson. Sir? How's the undercover work coming along? Very well, thank you. Any closer to finding that girl you're after? I hope so. We have a photograph now, at least. Yes, I heard about that. Good work, Dawson. It's just this sort of thing that gets you noticed at Divisional. Was there something else you wanted, sir? I came to see Chief Inspector Briggs, but he's gone out to lunch. Since I have an hour to kill, I thought perhaps I could take you out for a bite? There's an excellent restaurant not too far from here. Thank you, sir, but I've already eaten. In fact, I was about to go out on the beat. Another time, then. Where's that new piece of tail got to? Ned's favourite. Ruby? She'll be in later. Good. I'll make sure she makes it up to you. It's probably best she steers clear from now on. How about you keep your nose out? Hold on. Maybe someone wants her for himself? THEY LAUGH Well, well. You've got quite a poker face on you, Fenton. Remind me never to play you. Get him a drink. Anything he wants. Don't bother. That's the second refusal today. I'm starting to get a complex. So you lost money on the fight. No need to get bent out of shape. All better? Give it to Maddock's kids. Hey, I feel bad about it too. They would've been well provided for if their father hadn't been so dumb. Too many blows to the head, I reckon. If they come for you I ain't protecting you, Lenny. Not this time. Who do you think you're talking to? It's all right, let him make his little speech. Go ahead, we're all ears. No speech, I'm just letting you know how it is. You. Since you're still here. Keep the booze and the girls coming. That includes Ruby. Here you go, Sarge. Are these your incident reports? Yes, Sarge. There's a lot of it. That's not just the backlog, sir. That's from today's beat. A pickpocket, couple of vandals, and a drunk and disorderly. So when did you have time to do all this? I just... skipped lunch, Sarge. Well, keep up the good work. But try to keep on top of it from now on. Yes, Sarge. Thank you, Sarge. Sir, may I speak with you for a moment? This is not a good time, Dawson. It can't wait. What is it? It's, erm... It's delicate. Well? Chief Coulson, sir. He's been... propositioning me. Inappropriately. HE SIGHS I'm sure it's just a harmless flirtation. It's more than that. Then perhaps you need to grow a thicker skin. Now, if you don't mind... Sir, I don't wish to lodge a complaint. I should think not, Constable Dawson, because we wouldn't want your own conduct to be examined too closely, now, would we? Sir? Don't think I haven't heard what went on between you and Detective Burns. Perhaps if you don't like the attentions of the other men, you should have considered your reputation. Good night. I have some news. I found a place for sale. On the coast. I put down a deposit. Congratulations. To new beginnings. I thought you'd be upset. You're best out of all this. You could always come with me. What's this? What do you think it is? A birthday present. When have you ever remembered a birthday? 40. It's a big 'un. Don't remind me. It's all downhill from here. Open it. Sid. DOOR OPENS Where have you been? I called the station, and they said you left hours ago. I'm sorry, I didn't mean for you to worry. You're drunk. I'm not. Yes, you are, you're drunk. I had a couple of drinks - so what? Well, if you're expecting dinner, you're too late, it's ruined. I'm not hungry. I wish I'd known. I wouldn't have bothered. For God's sake, I said I was sorry! Now get off my back! Charlotte. ♪ Good night, sweetheart ♪ Till we meet tomorrow... ♪ Mr Hutton said you wanted to see me. Yeah, we were hoping you'd do us the honour of joining our table. As you can see, Ned's all on his lonesome tonight. I'm not really a hostess. It's all right, it's all squared with the boss. Go on. That's a pretty name, Ruby. Thank you. A pretty name for a pretty girl. Isn't she? Ned? Yes. THEY LAUGH Ned's not much of a talker, I'm afraid. I only talk when I've got something to say. Just my type, then. Like Gary Cooper. You're going to freeze to death. I'm OK. It's hot in there. Won't you be cold? I don't care. Are you all right? You seemed upset before. You're not the only one who has to pretend in this place, you know. Yeah, sometimes you want to tell them all to go to hell. Something like that. You probably shouldn't be here, though. Mr Powell wants you to sit with him. I got the feeling you didn't like it. I don't. Does that bother you? No. You'd best get back. See you later, Mr Hutton. Call me Chris. All right, then, I'll give him your message. Nice talking to you. Bye-bye. Oh, Inspector Briggs, you just missed your brother. What? Your brother, Carl. That was him on the phone. He's an absolute tonic! He was telling me about the two of you when you were kids. What did he want? He said he's in town for the day and he wants to see you. He's staying at this address. Thank you. Ow! Please, Ned! No! I'm busy. SHE SCREAMS Mr Powell just called. He wants to see you. What? Where is he? At home. He said right away. We don't have much time. What? There's no time to talk - just get dressed. Take the back way out. Through the kitchen. Here take this. Get out of town and don't ever come back. What'll you tell Ned? Let me worry about that. Thank you. Go. Hey, there he is! Congratulations, son. For what, Sarge? For doing such a thorough job with these reports. I must say, in all my years, I've never read notes quite as detailed before. I like to cover all b-b-bases. Well, that you do. It's been a real eye-opener. I had no idea you were so heroic in the field. I particularly like your account of the apprehension and questioning of the phone box vandal. Where is it? Ah, yes. "He was no better than a two-bit bum, the kind of guy "who'd sell his own mother for nothing and still ask for change." What does that even mean? Erm... And this bit. "He was pure evil. "If I hadn't taken him off the streets, we'd all be a little "less safe in our beds tonight." I didn't realise Mr Bailey posed such a threat. You see... No, no, there's more, you see. This is my favourite, about the drunk you arrested yesterday... "He had eyes like a snake, cold and dead. "I knew he'd try to strike the first chance he got, "and that's why I had to show him who was boss. "'Sorry, friend, but you crossed the line. "'Time for a date with Lady Law.'" I didn't write any of that! Excuse me? Miss Nightingale was only supposed to copy my notes. Miss Nightingale? Are you saying you didn't type these notes up yourself? Sorry, Sarge. That is a disappointment. To be lied to like that. I'm going to have to try and think of a way for you to make it up to me. HE LAUGHS Hold on a second. Now, where did I put them? Mr Snake-Eyes made a right mess of the cell last night. Upset stomach, amongst other things. Thank you. Thank you. Ticket to London, please. Thank you. Thank you. Going somewhere? It's good to see you, Mr Powell. Can I get you a drink? You can answer me question. It's just a weekend away. I didn't think it was worth mentioning. So this has got nothing to do with you sending Ned on a false errand earlier? What do you mean? One of the girls said you'd called. I just passed on the message. We go back 20 years, Rosie. Haven't I treated you right? Of course you have, Mr Powell. Then where's the loyalty? Hmm? Why bite the hand that feeds? You know what I'm talking about. What happened to the girl? Answer me. It wasn't right keeping her prisoner. Who are you to say what's right? I won't be party to it. Where is she? Where is she?! Somewhere I hope you'll never find her! SHE SCREAMS TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT Rebecca Jones? No. We'd like to ask you some questions about Councillor Daniel Pembrook. Leave me alone, I don't know anything. Would you come with us, please? No. No... no! I need to get out of here! Come on now, miss. You don't understand! Please, let me go! KNOCK AT DOOR How dare you call my secretary? Oh, I'm sorry, should I have called your wife instead? Just keep away from where I work, is that clear? All right, cool it, I'm sure nobody followed you here. Have you got it? Is it all there? Count it if you want. Where did you get it? That is none of your damn business. And if I ever see you again, I'm arresting you. I don't care what stories you tell. Stay for a drink. There's no reason we can't be friendly, is there? This is my life. My life! I should kill you. Go ahead! What have I got, eh? What's wrong? Are you OK? I'm sorry. Here, take it back. Keep it. Oh, Inspector Briggs... Charlotte. What are you doing here? I've just been to the bank. I was going to tell you. Really? When? While I was writing a cheque to the builders? Don't be ridiculous. You had no right. It's our money, isn't it? Daddy left it to me. Would you rather we'd lost the house? We've been... falling behind with the payments. I didn't want to worry you with it, but now you know. And I'm sorry about the kitchen. I know how much you wanted it. But sometimes a man has to prioritise. Is that what you are, Walter? A man? ♪ There is nothing I couldn't do ♪ Lord, if I had you ♪ Mm-hmm-mm... ♪ Is that supposed to be your tip? Last of the big spenders. You should ask to be a hostess. Make some real money. I'm fine doing this. If you say so. Get me a Scotch. Well, hello. What's a handsome fellow like you doing in a place like this? What? Buy a girl a drink? Haven't you got work to do? Sorry. Are you all right? Chris? It's Mr Hutton. Miss Jones, we found the body of Councillor Pembrook in your flat. We know you had a relationship with him. Why didn't you come forward? Were you in the flat the night he was murdered? You're not in any trouble yet, Miss Jones. Just tell us what you know. Did you see who murdered him? If you don't start cooperating, we'll arrest you for obstructing a police investigation - is that what you want? Clearly it is. Perkins. What do you want to do, sir? I'm thinking we gag her and go to work with some pliers. You in? It's a joke. Where's Dawson? She's met her before, maybe she'll have better luck getting her to talk. She's at the Sapphire Club, sir, won't be back till morning. GIGGLING Night, Ruby. Night. I'm sorry about earlier. You seemed upset. I just should've made it clear, it's best the others don't know. Don't know what? That I like you. Did you drink all that by yourself? I did. Looks like you're going to have to save me from myself. It's late. I should go. Just one glass. Please don't let me sit here all alone. Knock-knock! Rosie? It's me. You ready? Your chariot awaits. Rosie? Oh, God! Oh, baby. Rosie. Rosie. No brothers and sisters, just my mum and dad. So pretty ordinary, really. What about you? My mother died a few years ago, so it's just me now. I'm sorry. What about your father? He ran out before I was born. It's his loss. If only he could see you now. Sitting here, drinking champagne. With a girl like you. You're something else, Ruby, you know that? I should go. Don't. I really have to go. OK. KNOCK AT DOOR Sidney? Sidney, is that you? You're in late. You'd better not stink of beer, Sidney, or you can sleep on the settee. I've got your dinner on the stove - do you want me to warm it up? No. Suit yourself. Er, you'll never guess what some cheeky so-and-so said to me at work today. Honestly, I could've swung for him. I was at the make-up counter, right, and this bloke comes up and he says he wants to buy something nice for his wife. So I said, "Certainly, sir, what sort of thing are you after?" And he goes, "Well, I don't really know." I says, "What sort of colours does she like to wear? "You could get her some eye shadow or lipstick or something "to complement her wardrobe." And he goes, "Well, I don't really know." I says, "Well, pick something you like, then. "What about this cherry lipstick? It's very popular at the moment. "In fact, it's what I'm wearing right now." And he goes, listen to this, he goes, "No, thank you, "I want her to look nice." Can you believe that? Sidney? I said, can you believe that? No. No, neither could I. Like I said, I could've swung for him. SHE SQUEALS What's this? Sidney! This is so romantic! SHE GASPS Oh, this is... lovely. Sidney, it's gorgeous! I can't wait to go out now so I can show it off. Oh, I just love it, Sidney! I can't wait to tell the girls at work.
