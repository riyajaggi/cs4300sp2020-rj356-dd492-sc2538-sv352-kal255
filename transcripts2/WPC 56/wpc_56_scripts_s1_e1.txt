 Come on. It's up here. It's just through there. Did you remove these? Had to. She ran in and wouldn't come out again. Stay here. Hey! Wait for me! Give me your hand. OK! Thank you! You're welcome. I can't be late on my first day, can I?

 Your first day? A police woman? At your service. What do you think? Do I look the part? Lord, yes. Criminals of Birmingham beware. You know, me so scared on my first day in England, me want to turn around and catch the boat right back home again. But now, me wear three jumpers in the wintertime, so me feel right at home. Take him down to the cells till he sobers up. Morning, Sergeant, I'm... Hey, now, right, I warned you two, didn't I? Where do you think you are? Back row of the pictures? You, move over there. Go on, right till the end.

 And stay there. Ah, you must be WPC Dawson. Yes, Sergeant. Sergeant Pratt. Come on through. I'll take you to the Chief, he's expecting you. Thank you, Sergeant. It's lucky I'm here in one piece. I nearly got flattened by a police car just now. Not the best start, is it? Move your backside, lad, or I'll move it for you! Any more funny business and I'm locking you both in separate cells. What were they arrested for, Sergeant? Arrested? They're the victims. They were impressed with you at Divisional Headquarters. Thank you, sir. Why volunteer for a post in Brinford? I grew up around here, sir. I live with my mum and dad, so it's sort of perfect, really. Well, perfect might be pushing it. Anyway, I'm glad I won't have to take the daily train to Birmingham any more, now my training's over. I'll be honest with you, Dawson. Recruiting you wasn't my idea. I have a team of good men here, but they're few in number. They haven't the time or resources to concern themselves with your safety. That's all right, sir, I wouldn't expect... Let me finish. Whether you need protection or not is beside the point, men are naturally inclined to offer it. So it's best for you to avoid situations that lead to them being... distracted. Yes, sir. I expect you had female-only offices and facilities in Birmingham. As you can imagine, we've hardly the space for that here. But we've made provision for you as best we can. Honestly, you could stick me in a broom cupboard, I'm just grateful to be here. Well... What I mean to say is, thank you, sir, for this opportunity and I'm ready to go about my duties as soon as possible, sir. Well, if the men need help with women or children, you're to take that off their hands. Yes, sir. Never forget that your sole responsibility is to support the men, so they can get on with the job of real policing. Oi! Don't leave 'em sitting there, then! I'd rather have chocolates sitting on me desk than you. You only left 'em out to make me jealous. It's not working, you know. All right, it's working. Who gave 'em ya? That would be telling. I bet whoever he is doesn't have a Triumph Tiger. When are you going to come for a ride with me? When you drive something proper, like a car. I'll get you on my bike yet, Cathy Sinclair, you see if I don't. Oh! I just typed the same sentence twice. I hear the new WPC's arrived. What's she like? Coulson, what are you doing? Nothing, sir. Evidently. Make yourself useful and show Dawson her office. Yes, sir. How come she gets her own office? I need those letters sent out today, Miss Sinclair. This actually is a broom cupboard. Handy for keeping the place clean though, eh? Will I get my own telephone, do you think? Not likely, we'd never get you off it. Well, if I get lonely I can always talk to myself, I suppose. You're a funny one, aren't you? What do you mean? Just take a seat here, Mr Marsh. DI Burns? This is WPC Dawson, just started today. Good to meet you, sir. Likewise. Your timing couldn't be better. Do you know where the teapot is? Sir? It's just in the kitchen. How many sugars? Two. Actually, make it four. Um, yes, sir. A day like today calls for four, I reckon. Cigarette? No, thanks. Sit tight. I'll be right back. So he grabbed your purse and ran off down St James Street. Fenton. There's been a sighting, 'bout ten minutes ago. Where? Kenrick Road. Right, everybody to the courtyard, that's a double! Looks like we found your bag-snatcher. Just kidding! Don't worry, we'll be in touch if anything turns up. That's it. Through there. Where is everyone? Everyone was ordered to the courtyard, miss. He said on the double. Sorry, didn't hear the order! Um, Sergeant Fenton? Shut the doors! We haven't got all day! Thanks for making a statement, Mr Marsh. I can get someone to drive you home, if you like. If you can call it that. I live on a canal boat. Oh. PC Hunt. Yes, sir? could you drop Mr Marsh off at...? Where's your boat? It's still moored up near the mine, for now anyway. There's no part of the country I haven't stopped in, one time or another. I like to walk the hills and countryside. Have you ever collected wild flowers, Detective Burns? Collected? Pressed. You don't need a proper flower press, a good solid book will do. Can't say I have. I'm just an amateur, really. You find the rarest species of plants where people don't often go. I'll be off then. Can you tell if it was a boy or a girl? We haven't examined the remains yet, Mr Marsh. But it was a child, wasn't it? You did the right thing calling it in. Right, listen up. We approach as quietly as possible. Spread yourselves out. Cover all the exits. And remember, lads, they could be armed. Who's this? Her name's Dawson, Sergeant. She's the new WPC. I can see that. What's she doing here? She just got in the van, Sergeant. Brilliant. Maybe Cathy should've come along too. And Glenda the tea lady. Get back in the van. I won't get in the way, Sergeant, honest. No, you won't. Because you'll be in the van. Don't move till we get back. Right, you ready? Yes, Sergeant. A 60/40 split. Daylight robbery is what it is. Hardly worth my while. I hope you know that. Do you want them or what? But you know, obviously, as your mate... Everybody stay where you are! Drop the bag. Don't be like that. I said drop it. Look, I had nothing to do with the hijacking, I swear. I was just helping to flog the fags. You know me, I wouldn't get involved in no violence. Tell it to the judge. Wait, Fenton, Fenton! Please! Don't! Keep your voice down. You don't want to arrest me, not now. Oh, don't I? I'm close to something big. I'm serious, if this pays off you'll be a hero. What you talking about? Bank job. All right? Big one. Week from now, maybe two, but it's definitely happening. And you're in on it? I told you I don't do nothing with guns. But there's this kid I know, right, he's trying to make a name for himself. I've done him some favours and he trusts me, all right, enough to talk. I'm no good to you if I'm banged up for this, now am I? Hey. Stop! Police! Hey! I should've come with you, Sergeant. He wouldn't have given me the slip. I could still outrun you, lad, don't you worry. Hey. Stop! It's all right. I'm OK. All right. What did the pathologist say? He confirmed it was a boy, about six or seven. Evidence of rickets. Found that in his pocket. Had to scrape a fair bit off it, but you can still make out the date. 1923. Think he could've been down there that long? Maybe. Or he just had an old coin on him. Did the pathologist give a cause of death? He said he'd call. Any theories? The skull was fractured. Could be he crawled into the tunnel somehow and fell in the dark. Poor kid. Yeah. Next time I give you an order you'll do as you're told. Understood? Yes, Sergeant. Go and clean yourself up. What happened to her? She picked the wrong job. Brinford Police, Sergeant Pratt speaking. Oh, thank goodness it's you! Ah, Mrs Pemberton. What can I do for you? My Hector's run away again! I don't know what to do! I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, he always comes home of his own accord. But anything could happen to him! Third time this week. Tell her we'll send someone right away. What? Just tell her. Oh. Mrs Pemberton? I'm WPC Dawson. I was told I'd be sent an officer. Don't worry, I'm just as qualified and twice as determined. I believe you reported a runaway by the name of Hector. Yes. How old is he? I explained all of this on the telephone. I just need a few extra details. I'm told this isn't the first time he's run off. And I'm worried sick! What if he runs into traffic? I won't let that happen, Mrs Pemberton. Could you describe him to me? Well, he has sandy-coloured hair. He looks the way you'd expect him to, really. Right. Perhaps you have a photograph? Well, I'll have a look. 'Will a painting do?' A painting? I did it myself. Had a devil of a time getting him to sit still. Hilarious. Grown men. Nothing better to do. Poor little thing, being left out in the rain like that. Come on, Charlie, love. Hey boy. Hello. Couple more pubs and I reckon we'll shift the lot. Does that mean we can finally have a pint? All in good time, amigo. Leg it! Stop! Stop! Police! She's been gone a long time. Think she's run into trouble? Like what? Torn her nylons again? Yeah, or broken a nail. Sergeant Fenton, do you want to charge them or shall I? You boys are in a lot of trouble. Flogging stolen goods is a serious of fence. I'm sure it is. But we bought them fags for us, didn't we, Kev? Didn't we? Yeah. 100-a-day habit, is it? You should cut down. Just tell me where you got 'em and I'll have a word with the magistrate. All right, hang on a sec. Let me, erm... Ah, do you know what, I think I may have lost the receipt. Right! You think this is funny?! No! I don't! I'm sorry! Ow! Ow! Ow! When I go to the trouble of letting you go, I don't expect you to get yourself nicked again. It's that woman copper. She's everywhere. For you and me both. Is that the lad? Not the face! Ow! So what do we do? I'll handle it. What happened to counting to three? Oh, shut up. I think you've broken it. You're fine, stop acting like such a woman. I'll let you go in a few hours. Can I be out by 6.00? I'm meant to be taking a bird to the pictures. So you missed the second goal then? Good of you to stay late, sweetheart. Seems like we all fell behind on our paperwork. It's all right, Sergeant Fenton. I hear you let Brody and his friend go. And? It's just I thought... because of the cigarettes. What cigarettes? G'night then. Not so fast. End of your first shift. Time for a Brinford branding. You can't do that, she's a woman. It's a station tradition. Why should she be exempt? What is it? We all get to, you know, rubber-stamp you. Where? On the bum. All right, then. Fetch the stamp. Go on, Eddie, you heard her. It's this or nothing. That'll do. Oh, and, eh, watch the stockings. I don't fancy explaining this to me mum. Go on, Pratt! Get stuck in, son. Saving the best till last. Go on, Eddie. Goodnight, gentlemen. Is this what it's going to be like from now on? Dinner ready and no sign of her? Give her a chance, Brenda. It's her first day. Here she is. How'd it go, love? It went great, Dad. Everyone's really nice. Well, sit down. I want to hear all about it. No, never mind that. You said you would finish work an hour ago. I had to lay the table myself. Oh, I'm sorry, Mum. Here, sit down. It must be really hard work laying that table. Don't you be so cheeky! Your mother's right, show some respect. She's exhausted from carrying that cutlery about, look at her. Now don't encourage her, Joe. Gina, you go and get changed, for goodness sake, Frank'll be here any minute. I can wait on the doorstep, if you like. At least someone's got the good manners to be on time. I'd never be late for your home cooking, Mrs Dee. Hi. Ay! Sit down, everybody, your dinner's ready. It all smells smashing, Mrs Dawson. WPC Dawson. We're all proud as punch, aren't we? Hm? Oh, right, yeah. Jack? You just missed Daddy. Why aren't the girls in bed? He wanted to see them. Look what he gave us! Isn't it divine? Deborah. It's the best on the market. It does absolutely everything. We have to give it back. What? Don't be silly. I mean it. We can't keep accepting gifts. Why not? Daddy can afford it. That's not the point. There's nothing wrong with having nice things, Jack. Besides, we have to keep it. I need it for your party on Saturday. What party? It's your birthday. I want you to invite your friends from work. No, absolutely not. You never let me meet them. They're not my friends, Deborah, I just work with them. Well, then a party's exactly what you need. Come on, please, it'll be fun! Please? I know just what to make. Hey! Oi! I swear to you. I never touched that girl. I only try to help her. Here's what I think. I think you tried to force yourself on her. An innocent girl crossing the park. She put up a fight and you bludgeoned her, isn't that right, Mr Palmer? That's not what happened. I hear her scream and come running. A white man was standing over her. Oh, a white man? He had a knife. So you saw a man. The girl's unconscious, he has a knife. What did you do? I shout at him and he run off. You let him get away? I stay to help the girl. I scared she dead. That's how I get the blood on me. Why run from the scene? I wasn't born yesterday. People see a black man with a white girl's blood on him, they think what you thinking right now. It looks like we've made a big mistake. Looks like we've got a hero in our midst. What do you say, should we give him a medal? What were you doing in the park? Is it on your way home? Me finished work. That's not what I asked. Me feel like a walk. At night? On your own? It's not a crime to go for a walk. I never touched that girl. So you keep saying. Sergeant Fenton, take Mr Palmer down to the cells. Sir, the coloured prisoner. I've met him before, on the bus. And? Well, he just didn't seem the type to hurt someone. You can't always tell, Dawson. Has he admitted it? Not yet. DI Burns. Yes. Just a second. You couldn't get me a cup of tea, could you? Yes, sir. Thank you. Two sugars. Is everything all right? No, I haven't had a chance yet. Because I've been working, Deborah. I said I'd invite them, and I will. A decent girl's not safe walking the streets any more. Not with foreigners pouring in every day. Don't worry, Cathy. I'll protect you. Not very nice, is it? Beating a helpless girl unconscious. Well, I've got news for you, boy, you better hope she pulls through. Or you're going to swing for murder. You not the only one who care about my Sylvia! You're on first-name terms, are you? I don't want to get her in trouble. You're beginning to try my patience. She take the bus home every night. She work in the hotel. We talk all the time. Last night she ask me to walk her home. Why would she do that? You never take a walk with a girl before? The park is quiet at night. So you two...? Just a kiss. But then she get scared. I bet she did. Not of me, man. She scared somebody see us. So she asked to walk the rest of the way alone. After I leave her, I hear her screaming and I come running back. You expect me to believe that? Yes, because it's the truth! The truth is that she let you flirt with her. No, man. And you pushed too far. No, man. Come on. You're in the park. There's nobody about. Who's to stop you? That's not me, man. It wasn't me, man. Shh, shh, shh. We've all been there. Some girl leads you on, hmm. Makes out like she wants it. And when she changes her mind, it makes you angry, right? Make it easier on yourself. Plead guilty, hey. Cos either way, we've got you. You're sure? Could you send over a copy of that, please? As soon as possible. Thanks. That was the pathologist. Seems the boy did die from a blow to the back of the head. Only thing is, no other bones were fractured. Meaning? Meaning, if he'd fallen hard enough to kill him, he'd have other injuries. So it's a murder investigation? Looks like it. Then I'll see to it the men assist you in any way they can. Thank you, sir. Mr Palmer. We've met before, remember? I ran for the bus. Your first day. They say I hurt my Sylvia. I know. It's not true, I swear. Why would I hurt her? I love her. Will you help me? Please. Sergeant Fenton. I've just seen Donald Palmer. He's been beaten up. You'd best stay out of things that don't concern you. Sorry, Sergeant, it's just that I'm new here and I'm not sure how it all works. Do we beat all the prisoners, or just the coloured ones? Watch yourself, girl. What's this, Dawson? If there's a problem, I expect you to speak up. I was concerned about the coloured prisoner, sir. Sir, it's nothing to worry about, when we brought him in... When I want to hear from you, Sergeant Fenton, I'll ask. DI Burns. A word, please. Yes, sir? You and Fenton interviewed Mr Palmer together. Can you explain how he came to be injured? He was apprehended last night by a civilian, sir. I believe he got a little roughed up in the process. Satisfied? Yes, sir. DI Burns, you've got a phone call. Thank you. Fenton. She's awake. She remember anything? What? The girl. Is she fit to make a statement? We'll find out. Sergeant Fenton. I'd like you to follow up on the pawn shop burglary. Sir, that case has stalled. I'm in the middle of... It's your job to look for leads, isn't it? Dawson. Yes, sir? You're to accompany DI Burns to the hospital. What?! A young girl has been seriously assaulted. I expect she'll feel more at ease with a female officer present. Any objections? No, sir. Good. If you'd like to go through the door, she's in the bed on the right. Thank you, Matron. Leave the questioning to me. You're just here as a friendly face, understood? Yes, sir. I'll keep my mouth shut and my notebook open. DI Burns. I didn't mean to get Sergeant Fenton into trouble, honest. Chief Inspector Nelson just came out of nowhere. He does have a habit of doing that. Word of advice - steer clear of Fenton from now on. Yes, sir. Mr and Mrs Stewart? Miss Stewart. I'm glad to see you're feeling better. I'm DI Burns and this is WPC Dawson. We'd like to ask you a few questions, if we may? Is it all right if I call you Sylvia? Yes, officer, sir. Sylvia, can you tell me exactly what happened last night? I'll try. It all happened so fast. I was on my way home from work. And I decided to take a short cut through Victoria Park. What have I told you about crossing that park at night? Mr Stewart, please, it's important your daughter speaks freely. There's this little pathway that runs through some trees. There's not much light down there. All of a sudden I heard these footsteps, coming up behind me. Before I could turn around he'd grabbed me. Sorry. You're safe now, Sylvia. The person who did this can't hurt you again. Right now I bet he's scared of you. I tried to get away. I was screaming. He put his hand over my mouth, so I bit him. Then he started hitting me. That's the last thing I remember. Did you see what he looked like? Any details at all? It was too dark. Like I said, he came at me from behind. Do you recognise this man? He was caught running away. He had your blood on him. So this is him, is it? Filthy animal. He denies the attack. He's a bus conductor on the route Sylvia takes from work. He says you'd become friends. He's lying. I don't know any coloured men. Look at the picture again. You've never spoken to him? Why would I? Apart from paying the fare. He must've followed me off the bus. So you think this man attacked you? Well, tell him, Sylvie. It was him, wasn't it? Yes. You're sure? I'm sure. Sir, I think Donald was telling the truth. They were sweethearts. And what are you basing this on? Woman's intuition? No, sir. Well, maybe a bit. But look at how she reacted when she saw his picture. I'd be pretty shaken up too if I was seeing my attacker. But she didn't see him, sir, not properly. I think she's scared of how her father might react so she lied to protect herself. You think she'd accuse the wrong man? Maybe. Poor girl's been beaten half to death and you call her a liar. And let's say she did flirt with him. So what? If she admitted it, she'd look like she was asking for trouble. Eddie, got any cigarettes? Thanks. She says she bit him. You saw Donald's hands. Was there a bite mark? It's pretty hard to break the skin. Look, I know you'd like to think he's innocent, but all the evidence points to Donald Palmer. But shouldn't we...? We? You did well at the hospital, Dawson, but let's not get carried away. Just type up the statement and leave the casework to us. Yes, sir. Hold on. There is something else you can do when you're done with that. There's a newspaper archive at Brinford Library. See if you can find anything about a missing boy from the area. The one from the mine, sir? Yeah, anything from 1923 on. Deborah. Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen. What are you doing here? I knew you'd never get around to announcing your own birthday, so I decided to do it for you. Is it your birthday, sir? Kept that one quiet, Burns. It's on Saturday, and you're all invited to come and celebrate it with us. And bring your wives too. Please, everyone's more than welcome. And to give you all a taster of things to come... Thank you very much! Don't mind if I do, Mrs Burns. Oh, smashing. Two boys? Yes, sir. William Parker and Stanley Collins. They went missing from Crossmere Woods in 1926. They were at least six years old, poor little tykes. Did you note it down? Yes, sir, I left it on your desk. Thank you. What is it, sir? If it's the same case there could be a second body out there. I need a woman. Pardon me? Not like that. There's been a call. Come on. Thank goodness. Are you Gladys Campbell? I live downstairs. I didn't know what else to do. She's got a couple of little ones alone in there. The baby's quiet now, but he's been screaming for hours. It's enough to break your heart. Do you know who their mother is? Irene Miller's her name. We're no longer on speaking terms. Why's that? I tried to help her where I could. It's not right, a young mother struggling on her own. But it got to be like she expected it. When I said I got my own children to think about, well, you should've heard the language. Now don't be afraid of Auntie Gladys. That is for being such a good boy. He's always so hungry, God bless him. Do you know where we might find Irene? Where she always is. Down the pub with God knows who. We're going to have to break in. We don't have a warrant for that. But it's an emergency, isn't it? Can you smell gas? Gas? I don't smell anything. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's definitely gas. Guess I'll have to break in. All right, stand back. Move out the way, lad. Officer Dawson. Give him here. He's just a bag of bones, God love him. Would you see if there's any milk? Yeah. Where's your mummy gone to? Come on, stand up. Nothing. Poor little mite. Are you coming up, then? Eh? Are you coming up?! Nah, I can't. Aw, come on! Suit yourself! What are we supposed to do with them? Take them somewhere safe. I saw him on the street yesterday. Knew something wasn't right. I should've done something. You couldn't have known you'd find this. Hey! What are you doing in my house? We were concerned about your children. What business is it of yours? Get your hands off my baby! Stay where you are. We're taking your children to the hospital. You're not taking them anywhere. You're in no fit state to look after them, you're drunk. I am not! I can smell it from here. Get out, all of you! Just get out! Take the baby outside, please. No! We're going for a ride in a police car. Would you like that? I said you're not taking him! Come here. Mrs Miller. Irene, please, let him go. Please don't do this. If I'm in jail, they'll put them in care. I'm sorry. Let go. Right, that's it. You bitch! You bitch! You've got no right! Let go. Stay there! I hear you saved a couple of kids today. I suppose I did, sir. So how come I feel so guilty? Cos there's only so much we can do. Thanks again, Miss Stewart. I'll see you out. She just signed a formal statement against Donald Palmer. Goodnight, Dawson. Next time you're late, you'll have to go without. It'll be tough as old boots by now, but I'll hear no complaints. You'll never guess who I saw down in the shops. Your friend Jane, from school. Seven months gone, can you believe it? Happily married and loving every minute. Sylvia Stewart made a statement. Palmer attacked her and he'll answer for it in court, Wednesday. Case closed. Get up and see to your children! Stop it! Today we lay William Parker to rest. I've had too much to drink. I think you've had just the right amount. Put your hands in the air. Put your hands where I can see them. Sorry, sir. Sorry doesn't even cover it, Fenton! You've made a complete laughing stock of us! You ought to make up your mind what you want.
