 WPC 56 (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - Little Boy Lost - full transcript 
 Cathy dumps her aggressive boyfriend Bill whilst Gina puts her career above Frank's marriage proposal. Meanwhile the police are in the firing line of the press following the murder so Gina agrees to be bait despite Burns' protests and walk through the park where the women were attacked. She has an encounter with an angry Bill,who is arrested but then the real culprit strikes and Gina survives through her strong will and ability to talk to him. His arrest also ties in with the question of what happened to the missing Stanley and back at the police station all the staff,even Fenton, commend her as Coulson announces that she is to be put forward for a bravery medal. Burns however receives sad news from the psychiatric hospital.

 You want to get your priorities right, Detective. He's a married man. It was just a drink. It's enough to ruin your reputation. You said you were working. We were talking about a case. Please, don't let them hurt me any more. I said stop! I can do what I want. Hurt her again and I'll have you thrown into a cell. If George Stern is Stanley Collins, where is he now? Are you ready, Reverend? Yes, that's Patricia.

 What in God's name happened to her hair? She was found with it cut like that. How did she die? She was... strangled. I'm so sorry, Reverend. No! No! We have confirmation, Sir, it was Patricia Buckley. Good, Always better to announce a name. Lets them think we're making progress. Were there any signs of sexual assault? Yes, Sir. And her hair was cut, like the others. Yes, well, let's keep the sordid details to ourselves for now. But you'll announce that this is the fourth. Fourth what?

 Victim, sir. Sylvia Stewart, Anna Pearce, Mary Cook... Were all assaulted. This is murder. Entirely different. Sir, the public has a right to know there's a madman on the loose. I fail to see what that would achieve. Well, they could make precautions, Sir, make sure women don't go out alone at night. No, we say nothing for the time being. Inspector Nelson agrees with me on this. It's probably best not to cause a panic. I'm not about to go out and advertise your incompetence, Detective Burns, it reflects badly on all of us. Excuse me? Correct me if I'm wrong, but so far you've failed to find a single lead on this case! Which is why I've decided it's time for you to step aside. Sergeant Fenton has been seconded into CID. From now on he'll be in charge of the investigation. You can't do that. I think you'll find that I have. They're ready for you, Sir. Thank you. Whoever is responsible for this heinous act, we will find him. Patricia Buckley's death will not go unpunished. I appeal to the good men and women of our community to assist the police in any way they can. If you have seen or heard anything suspicious, contact us immediately. Together we will restore order and safety to our streets. Is it true the girl's hair had been cut? I will not disclose any detail that could harm our investigation. You will be kept informed of our progress in due course. Thank you all for coming. I've heard there were other, similar attacks. Should women be concerned for their safety? Mr Sullivan! A man in your position should know better than to peddle rumours. The police force is here to protect its citizens. The people of Brinford must feel free to go about their business as normal. Inspector Nelson! Consorting with the top brass I see. A step up for you isn't it, Sergeant? Nothing I can't handle. Glad to see you're so confident. Any suspects yet? Tick-tock, Sergeant. What do you want? Told you it'd be worth the wait. Where you going? Work. Let me drive you. I'll take the bus, thanks. Come on, Cathy, don't be like that. We can work it out, can't we? No, Bill, we can't because I'm not your girlfriend any-more. But what about our trip? Cathy, Cathy! Leave it on there. Burns, bring me up to speed, what did the pathologist say? I left a note on your desk. Indulge me. They took samples from under Patricia's fingernails. They're still examining her clothes at the lab. So, she was covered in muck from the park. Doesn't take a genius to work that out. There's still no harm in waiting for the results. Yeah, yeah. Sure it'll crack the case wide open. Sir. After you left, Mrs Buckley remembered a few more details, about her conversation with Patricia. It's nothing significant but... I'll be the judge of that. Right, as you know I've been asked to head up this investigation, which means that any and all information comes to me first. Now, down to business. We'll split into two groups. Team A, search the area for any evidence. Team B, gather statements from any potential witnesses. Dawson, we'll be getting lots of calls from the public on this, so I want you to write everything down. And I mean... everything. Yes, Sergeant. Right, gentlemen to the vans, on the double! Jack. I'm sorry for yesterday, what I said. Forget it. I never meant to hurt you. You didn't, you were right. What I have with Deborah actually means something. Why would I throw it all away over a bit of skirt? Hello, Brinford Police. You emptied the bins around five? That's right. And you saw nothing unusual? No suspicious characters hanging around? No. Sergeant Fenton! Ray! Get a shot of those. Both sides. Oh, am I glad to see you! I started my day in a hospital morgue, and things didn't really get much better after that. Don't worry, I'm not going to talk about work. I've done nothing but talk, people calling up, worried about going out, thinking that everybody's an axe murderer. I am talking about it, aren't I? Sorry. So you're not enjoying it, then? Work I mean? Well, it gets me down sometimes. Then this might cheer you up. I went to the bank today. They said I've got enough to make the payments on a place of our own. Think about it. No more parents telling us what to do. You can decorate it just the way you like it. You wouldn't have to work any-more. Could we have a couple of minutes? Aren't you going to say anything? Isn't it a bit soon to be talking about mortgages? I mean... We should... We've been courting a couple of years, Gina. Aren't you tired of waiting for our lives to begin? I know I am. You know, every day when I go through those factory gates, the one thing that keeps me going is the thought of you. I love you, Gina. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Frank... Gina Dawson, will you make me the happiest man in the world? Will you marry me? I'm sorry, I can't. Enjoy that, did you? Making a show of me? Sorry, I didn't know what to say. Did you ever love me? Of course I have, but... Good luck finding another man who'll put up with you. Bacon on a weekday? Have we won the pools? It's for a certain young lady who'll be making a certain announcement about a certain young man! Oh, Gina? Frank and I broke up. What have you done, you stupid girl? Brenda. I have to go to work. No, you'll stay here and tell me exactly what happened! It would never have worked, Mum! I'm too selfish, remember? Yes, you are. I'm sorry I let you down. That's right, you go off to work! But don't blame me if you end up all alone! You've got all our men on this Fenton, not to mention the team from Birmingham, and all you have to show me is evidence of a leaky van? We think it's a Ford Eight, sir. Do you even know if it's connected to the case? Well, not till we find... Then pull your finger out, Sergeant! If this is your only lead, it had better amount to something. I've got Divisional breathing down my neck on this. Dawson. You want to help us catch this killer, right? Yes, Sergeant. You'll do whatever it takes? Of course, Sergeant. Eddie! Hello? I didn't know you were back today. Did you miss me? Maybe. Thanks for coming to the hospital. Any time. Cathy...? D'you fancy a spin? Just round the courtyard. Go on, I'll go slow, I promise. All right. Yeah? All right. Hop on, then. Told you I'd get you on my bike some day, didn't I? All right, hold on tight. Ah, ow! Not that tight. I'm sorry. Are you OK? It was worth it. I'll see you in there. I was right about you and him, weren't I? I don't know what you're talking about. I won't be taken for a fool, not by anyone. Bill, you're hurting me! Oi! What d'you think you're doing? Just stay out of this. Get off her. STOP it! Worried about lover boy, are you? Oi! Get up! Come on, you, get here. If you ever go near Cathy again, I'll have you banged up so fast you won't know what hit you. For what? I never did nothing to her. You just assaulted a police officer. How long can you get for that, Sergeant Pratt? About three to five? Now you apologise to the lady. Sorry. Get in there. Go on. Go on. You OK? Cos if he hurt you I swear to God I'll... Tart her up and use her to catch him. Absolutely not. None of your business, Burns. I'm making it my business. What's the point of having a woman copper, if you can't use her as bait? It could get her killed. We have to do something, don't we? Otherwise he's just going to keep going. See? She knows what she's talking about. Are you really going to stand by and let this happen? Just simmer down, all of you. It's a risky strategy. But if we stage it right we can guarantee her safety. We can't guarantee anything. Nonetheless, I'll authorise it if Dawson is willing to take the risk. Yes sir, I am. That's decided then. We'll do it tonight. When it gets dark. I've lost a whole day's work stuck in here. You don't say? And I didn't get any lunch. You're lucky you didn't get my boot up your arse, and five years inside for what you did today. Now are you going to keep your nose clean, or are me and you going to have to have words? All right. I can't hear you. I said, "all right." No more trouble. We spread ourselves out along the route, hiding in twos. Not too close, but close enough to come running if anything happens. Dawson will start our route here, at the south entrance, passing through here, here and here, until she reaches the north gate. What if nothing happens, Sarge? Then she turns around and does the same route back again. All night if she has to. Until we catch the sicko. Questions? What are you doing? If you're doing this to get back at me, you win, OK? I'm begging you, please, don't do this. You two want us to clear off? Give you some privacy? No, Sergeant. Right, let's think about getting you tarted up. Just had a call from Birmingham. Woman called Bessie something - says she lives next door to George Stern. Has she seen him? No-one has, apparently. Which is why his landlord's chucking his stuff out tomorrow. She thought you would like to know. Thanks. Oh, and your wife called. At least I think it was your wife. She asked for you, and then hung up. Everything all right? Yeah, fine. High heels. Bit of skirt, that should do the job. We're forgetting one thing. He likes blondes. Excuse me, do you have the time? Yes. It's just gone seven. Thank you. I wasted three weeks' wages on that poxy ring, and they won't take it back. I tell you what I won't miss - I won't miss her in that horrible, ugly uniform all the time. Women, eh? Who'd have them? I mean, it's not too much to ask, is it? For your girlfriend to actually dress like a woman sometimes. Cathy turned heads. And didn't she know it. What I will miss is her Mum's puddings. Course, Gina couldn't cook to save her life. Yeah, I've made a lucky escape there, I know that much. And she was lippy and all. Eh? Your Gina. I bet it was her stirring things up between me and Cathy. It didn't need much stirring though, did it, Bill? You what? Well, you didn't have to go belt her one did you? You saying it's my fault? You have to admit, you've crossed a line there. She was two-timing me. All right. Maybe if you gave Gina a good slap once in a while, she'd have had some respect for you. Hey now, I'm not having that! Having what?! The truth?! She was a stuck up cow and you know it. You'll take that back. Or what? Cool it, lads. Come on! Or what! Oi, you're barred. Sling your hook. Don't worry, I'm going. I wouldn't do that if I were you. How dare you tie her down! It's for her own safety. I want to know what's been going on here? She broke into my office. We found her trying to make an unauthorised phone call. She was calling me. She obviously needed my help. Mr Burns, I understand you're upset. Upset? Look at her. You were supposed to be making her better. Come on, darling, I'm taking you home. I'm afraid there's no question of her to leaving. What are you talking about? She's my wife. She is also a very sick woman. And until I'm satisfied she's no longer a danger to herself, or anyone else, she will remain in my care. Oh, no. Sarge, I know him. Hey good looking. Not now, Bill, OK? You? What... What are you up to? You look like a right tart dressed like that. Ta very much. Kind of suits you actually. Hair and everything. All this time I thought you were dead square. And here you are, out on the prowl, eh? Maybe I picked the wrong woman. Is this all part of your plan? What plan? Break me and Cathy up. Dump Frank. So you could have me for yourself. Bill. I wouldn't go out with you if you were the last man on earth. See, now that's what I'm talking about. Just wait a minute. Nothing but lip. It's because nobody's given you what for. Get off me! Wait. He's hurting her! Stop, police! Get OFF me! Get off! You OK? Yeah. Get up. I knew he was bad news, but... Dawson, what are you still doing here? Sergeant? Go with the others. I've told you, it was her that came on to me. It was nothing. The sergeant told you to shut up! Wait! Hold on! Wait! How many times? My car wouldn't start, so I was walking home. And you just happened to assault a woman on the way? Look, I know Gina's one of your lot... That's Officer Dawson to you. All right. She's not as innocent as she looks. Yeah, I roughed her up a bit but, she broke my best mate's heart. Ah, well, that's very sweet. And what's your excuse for this morning, when you were attacking Miss Sinclair? Now that was a misunderstanding. I'd never lay a finger on Cathy. You're a liar! Whoa, take it easy! Cool it, Coulson. All right? Take a walk. Yes, Sergeant. He's got a screw loose, that one. Watch your mouth. So, let's talk about your relationship with Miss Sinclair. You made her dye her hair blonde, is that right? So what? Is that why you chose the others? I told you, there were no others. Don't play innocent with me, son. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about you, hanging - for murder. Is that clear enough for you, is it? Eddie, have you seen Dawson? She got a lift back in the van. Yeah, well, the lads said she was with you. What? No, she was told to go back with the others. Well she's not here. Oh, my God. Hello? Brinford 683. Speaking. Joe? Who is it? No, she hasn't come home yet. Has something happened? What do you mean something went wrong? What, I don't... Joe, who is it? It's Sergeant Pratt from the station. He says Gina's gone missing. It's no use. I'm telling you she's not here. Well, let's just keep looking, we're got to find her. Sergeant Fenton. Oil. You promise you'll be quiet? Well, what's your name, angel? Gina. Gina. What is this? I know you. You're that policewoman. They'll be looking for me. They'll be here any minute. No. No, no, no, no, they can't be. They don't know where you are. They'll work it out. They always do, when it's one of their own. It's just a matter of time. Shut up! They know you killed Patricia Buckley. I never meant to kill her. I just wanted her to stop screaming. If you give yourself up now, they'll make it easier for you. I'll make sure of it. No. No, no. How could you have let this happen? You people are supposed to protect her, not send her out alone to let God knows what happened to her. I'm so sorry, Mr and Mrs Dawson. I take full responsibility. If I know our Gina, she'd have insisted on going. Isn't that right, Chief Inspector? Here you are Mrs Dawson. Sir, still no answer from Burns' house. Get someone over there now. We need him here. Still nothing in the park, sir, but I've left some men to continue the search. Oh, and I've compared the second set of tyre tracks with the first. And are they a match? Yes sir, it's a Ford 8. And the oil stain's identical to where he dumped the last girl's body. Sergeant Fenton, these are Constable Dawson's parents. Mr Dawson. Mrs Dawson. I'd like to join the search if I may. I was in Special Ops. Mr Dawson, we appreciate the offer, but it's probably best for you and your wife to return home. Should Gina get in touch, you'll want to be there. Oh, Joe! The last time I spoke to her, I said some awful things. What if...? They'll find her. I won't be long. Is this Sarah Stern? Yes, that's her. Excuse me. 'I have to keep you safe.' You do whatever it takes. Please! Please. Let go of me. Shut up. What are you going to do? Don't make this worse than it needs to be. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. I know why you came down here, Stanley. This is where it all began, isn't it? What did you call me? That's your real name, isn't it? Stanley Collins. That was before. You're to call me George. You don't have to pretend to be someone else any more, Stanley. Sarah's gone. You don't know anything about my mother. I know she took you away from your real family. They never loved me like she did. Who wants a gingerbread man? Who's going to be a good boy? Stanley! William. She was an angel, sent from Heaven to save me. Mm. Mm. I'm glad Sarah loved you. Every little boy deserves to be loved. But what about William? Stanley! William! Go home! Where are you going? He was your friend. Did William deserve what happened to him? Mother had to keep me safe. She said she didn't hurt him. She just gave him back to God. Do you really believe that? Stay there! Sarah. William's dropped his glasses. I should have helped him. What could you have done? You were just a little boy. You don't care about me. Of course I do. I know how much you've suffered. You loved Sarah but you were frightened of her too, weren't you? Because she killed your friend and she took you away. And there was no-one in the world who could help. No, Buckley. Patricia. Just read it out to me, will you? Right. They found fibres, most likely from a woollen coat, and traces of iron ore under her fingernails. Iron ore? Could she have got that from the park? No, they cross checked it with a soil sample. So, she got it off him then. Maybe in the struggle? So, where would he have been to have come into contact with iron ore? The foundry. Or the mine, next to it. Wait, isn't that where William Parker's body was found? Well, what are you waiting for? Go! Hello? Mr Stern? Police! Gina! Run, run, as fast as you can. Agh! Agh! Agh! Aaagh! No. Please! You don't want to kill me. Stanley! I told you. Stanley's gone. Let her go! Stay back. Just put the knife down. It's over. I want every inch of this place searched! You three start with the mine, we'll take the foundry. Move it, get out! Um, Sarge! I'm arresting you on suspicion of the rape and murder of Patricia Buckley. You are not obliged to say anything but anything you do say may be given in evidence. Put him in the van. Did he hurt you? No. See? What did I tell you? There's not a scratch on her. The tragic case of two missing boys, snatched from our community in 1926, was never officially closed. In all these years, the Brinford Police never stopped searching for answers. Today we have those answers, and they are sobering indeed. They lead us to the very heart of what it means to create a monster. But such reflections are for another time. Right now we must rejoice in the fact that the streets of Brinford are a safer place tonight, thanks to the bravery of my officers. Chief Superintendent Coulson? When can we expect you to announce your promotion to Assistant Chief Constable? Any announcements will be made in good time. Thank you all for coming. Are you coming back with us? I think I'll stay for a bit. It's OK, Mum. I'll be home soon, I promise. How are you holding up? You know me. Takes more than a knife-wielding maniac to get me down. I've never been so scared. Don't ever scare me like that again. I'll try. You should go. Please don't report DI Burns. I'll go quietly. And how would it look if my star officer were to suddenly leave, hm? Look at you, you're a mess! Why don't you run along and freshen up? Yes, sir. Where is everyone? Out celebrating with the Chief, I think. Oh! I'll walk out with you. Tell you what, how about you and me go out for a drink? I should get going myself really. Go on, just the one. Who says the men should have all the fun? There she is! Did you know about this? Well, it ain't a party without girls, is it? Now that our guest of honour's here, I'd like to say a few words. No doubt there were one or two of you who thought that having a woman in our midst might be a waste of time. That she might not be able to match up to the men. Well, I think we can all agree that Officer Dawson well and truly proved her mettle today. Here, here! Here, here! Which is why I shall be commending her for a bravery award. So, let's all raise our glasses to our very own Woman Police Constable WPC 56. WPC 56!
