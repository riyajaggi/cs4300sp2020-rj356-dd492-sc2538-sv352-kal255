 WPC 56 (2013–…): Season 2, Episode 1 - Cry, Cry, Cry - full transcript 
 The travelling fair comes to town and Gina visits in search of runaway teenager Tracey Nichols. The fair's owner Brendan McCormac tells her that Tracey has returned to her family but in fact she is the lover of Brendan's son Sean who is hiding her. Tracey's Teddy boy brother and his gang arrive, looking for a fight, during which Tracey and Sean run away but he is fatally injured after being hit by a bus. Gina is dismayed when Jack Burns leaves to look after his wife. He is replaced by efficient Max Harper who investigates a sleazy murder committed by gangster friends of Fenton, who kidnap witness Rebecca. Other new arrivals at the station are clumsy PC Perkins and chief inspector Briggs' voluptuous secretary Susie. Gina is also the victim of Chief Constable Coulson's unwanted attention.

 I never meant to hurt you. You didn't, you were right. What I have with Deborah actually means something. Why would I throw it all away over a bit of skirt? What's the point of having a woman copper if we can't use her as bait? It could get her killed. Agh! SHE GASPS Do I know you?! You're that policewoman! Let her go! Stay back! Agh!

 Don't ever scare me like that again. SCREAMING OF PEOPLE ON FAIRGROUND RIDE There we go, a lollipop for the little girl. Come and have a go! You win a prize every time! Hook a duck! This way, ladies and gentlemen! Watch the step, it may be slippy! FIGURE LAUGHS HIDEOUSLY, BELL RINGS Oh! Shall we have a go? Sorry! Go on, it'll be fun! You know I can buy you all the bears you want. It's not the same. There you go. Thank you. Stop it! Daniel!

 I want to win something. OK, I'll stop, sorry. Come away with me. What? I mean it, Rebecca. Just you and me. We'll go tonight. Stop trying to put me off. I did it! I've never won anything before! Thank you! MUSIC CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND Act normally. I think we're being followed. Whatever you do, don't let go. GUN FIRES MUSIC AND FAIRGROUND NOISES CONTINUE OUTSIDE I think we've lost them. Excuse me. I'm looking for this girl. Have either of you seen her? Yeah. I saw her over by the coconut shy. Are you sure? We'll show you if you like. Yeah. Please. She were right here. Did you see which way she went? No, sorry. Excuse me, can you tell me who's in charge here, please? The big man there. Thank you. Right, good man, George. I'll see you later. Excuse me, are you the owner? Oh, yeah, that'd be me, yep. Brendan McCormac, guilty as charged. WPC Dawson. I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for this girl. Her name's Tracey Nichols. She's 15. She was seen here about ten minutes ago. She was seen here? No, no, no. I don't think so, love. No - that girl's from Wolverhampton. So you recognise her? Oh, I do, yeah. She earned my boy a black eye. Sean! Seany! The officer here is asking about that wee girl from the last stop. Tracey? Yeah. Reckons she's gone missing. I have reason to believe she might be in Brinford. Well, I haven't seen her. You wouldn't lie to me now... I've not see her, Da. Not since the fight. Can you tell me what happened? She come talk to me while I was working. I liked her. Well, her brother didn't take kindly to her consorting with the likes of my son, so he came over with a gang of thugs and beat seven bells out of him. Dragged the wee girl home across the field kicking and screaming. Well, according to her parents, she packed a bag and ran away. They're really worried about her. Are you sure she didn't return to the fair? No. I swear. You'll contact Brinford Police if you see her? Oh, we will, of course. Thank you. No bother. Go on, then, back to work, go on. Aren't you done yet? PHONE RINGS Thank you. What, don't the rest of us get a cuppa? And put Glenda out of a job? Wouldn't want to ruin your love life, Sarge. That's fighting talk, Fenton. Fighting talk. Looks like this award she's up for's gone to her head. Though what is brave about getting kidnapped I will never know. CHUCKLING A bit more work, less chatter, please. Burns, do you have a minute? Yes, sir. D'you hear about his wife? When did this happen? Last night. Two mirrors smashed you say? Yes, boss. HE TUTS Vandals, hey? And they say WE'RE uncivilised! You better get it closed up today until I get some more, all right? I should have known! That...! Please. Have you lost your mind?! Lying to the police? Lying to me? It wasn't his fault. You'd best keep your mouth shut, girl. Don't talk to her like that. I swear to God, Seany, don't you make me swing for you now. She's still a child - how d'you think this looks?! I haven't touched her. Sure I've been sleeping on the floor. We're gonna wait till we're married. Wait... What?! In May, when I turn 16. We love each other. This will bring trouble, Sean. They'll come after her. They don't know she's here. How long d'you think that will last? No. No. She has to go. Come on. Dad, please! She doesn't belong here. Then neither do I. Sean... I mean it. If she goes, I go. She's to stay out of sight. And from now on, she sleeps in the women's caravan Thank you, Mr McCormac. Don't you be thanking me, girl. You'll earn your keep. Er... the Chief's name's Briggs, not Biggs. PHONE RINGS If it was Tracey, there's a good chance she's still in Brinford. Gina... Of course I will, as soon as I hear anything. Goodbye, Mrs Nichols. Everybody, can I have your attention? Quiet, please. DI Burns has an announcement to make. As some of you know, my wife's been in hospital. I'm pleased to say she's returned home. But I'm afraid this has been my last shift. You what? It wasn't an easy decision to make, but right now I need to be with Deborah and the girls. After that, I'll consider my future. Well, I never thought I'd say this - I'll miss you, Burnsie. Likewise. If we'd known, we'd have given you a sendoff. I just want to say thank you, for some of the best years of my life. It's been a privilege working alongside... Not interrupting, am I? Of course, we're losing you today, aren't we, Detective Burns? Pity. I'll say goodbye then. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Jack. Thank you. Sir. You... dropped this. Oh, thank you. PC Perkins, isn't it? Y-yes, sir. So. That's it? You just leave, without a backward glance? No, of course not. Gina, this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, I... Please, don't be angry. I don't think I could bear it. How could you not tell me? I tried. What, just now? You didn't make this decision today, Jack. I know, I... I was afraid if I talked to you, I wouldn't be able to leave. Gina... There has to be another way. Be happy. Find someone to love you as much as I wanted to. Would you like to join us, Constable Dawson? - The funfair is in town. - Hey! The Gypsy community is known to stir up trouble. We want a visible police presence to show them this will not be tolerated here in Brinford. Haven't we got better things to do, sir? It's your job to keep law and order, isn't it? Yes, sir. Then I suggest you stop complaining and get to it, Sergeant. Yes, sir. Everybody - to the vans! May I ask if you've heard from Eddie and Cathy, sir? His mother and I received a postcard from Margate this morning. They're enjoying the honeymoon. CHUCKLING You can tell him from me, he owes me a secretary. Perkins! Stop brown-nosing and get moving! Yes, Sarge. Dawson. Wakey-wakey. Sorry, Sarge. MUSIC: "Bad Penny Blues" by Humphrey Lyttelton There you go. Oh, no, no, no... Sorry, I was... Excuse me. Sorry. Well, go on, then, let's see what you've got. I can't. I'm on duty. I won't tell! I shouldn't. Yeah, you're probably right. You would have missed anyway. Come on, copper. Come on! Come on, copper, you can do it. Come on. You could shoot it from a mile away. Ow! I-I was just about to tell her to watch her stuff, you know. A lot of undesirables about. You said it. Disgrace. Where's your professional pride? Believe me, it's the first thing to go when you start skipping meals. Oh, careful, you'll have me crying in a minute. If you're that desperate, why don't you give us a tip-off, hmm? Or have you run out of mates to grass up? Look, I'll have something for you soon, I promise - something big. I the meantime, you couldn't, erm, slip me an advance, could you? How about free room and board? BOTH: In a cell. Yeah. Nice to see you, too. Perkins! Sorry, Sarge. Stop mucking about and get back to work. Give him a break! Shut up! Expected more from you, Perkins. She m-made me do it, Sarge. D-d-did she now? I suppose you think, because you're the chief constable's golden girl, you can do what you like? I'm watching you, Dawson. Yes, Sergeant. I'm sorry, I-I don't know why I said that. It's fine. He's gone. Go on, quick! Come on, you can get the last one down. Come on, last one! Yes! Yeah! What am I supposed to do with this? Put it in a bowl? Here. You take it. Sorry. Got work to do! Ha-ha! Classic! Something you wanted, Swift? Yes, sir. Did you put an advert in the Brinford Times by any chance, sir? For a new secretary, yes. Why, has someone come about the position? Well, you could say that, sir. I can't interview them all, I've a report to finish! Of course, sir. Which one shall I send away? No, you're right, that wouldn't be fair. Oh, give me ten minutes and send the first one through. Yes, sir. You better not let Da see you. It's my brother. Go, quick! Well, look who it is! We know she's here. Hand her over to us, and we'll walk away. Over there, looks like trouble. Sorry, you might scare your little sister - but not me. POLICE WHISTLE BLOWS Dawson, what are you doing? Get back! All right, that's enough! Break it up! Break it up! Enough! Take the Teds to the van. What are you arresting us for? They're the criminals! Ask them where my sister is! Go on, ask them! What's all this? It's a runaway, Sarge. He's shacked up with her, the pervert! That's a dirty lie! That's enough! Take them all in! Go on, move it! Hold on, I need my crew for operating the machines! Guess you've got a bit of a problem, then, ain't ya? Straight down to the cells, lads. Come on, move it! Keep 'em moving. I ain't getting locked up with him! Hey, cut it out. Keep moving. Come on, Fletch. What happened to you? Ha-ha-ha-ha...! Thank you for coming in, Miss... er, Miss Bannister. We'll... be in touch. Are they multiplying or something? No, sir. Right, well, if anyone else turns up, tell them they're too late. Send the next one through. Right... which one of you lucky ladies wants to go next? Oh, that's right - rough us up! Go on, pig! Oh, now that really hurts my feelings. WE didn't do nothing wrong! Well, that ain't strictly true, is it? You've ruined a bunch of little kiddies' day out at the funfair. And that really upsets the good people of Brinford. Do you think this is funny? Those filthy Gypsies kidnapped my sister. The way I hear it, she's run off. She's 15! You're just going to let that Paddy have his way with her?! Hey! She's been interfered with, I'll see to it that he does time. But I've got better things to do than run around after some kid who don't want to be found. So, here's what we're going to do. YOU... are going to sit in this cell, like a good little boy. And in a bit, I'll let you go. Then maybe, with Romeo out the way, you'll have better luck finding Juliette. Right? Sorry about the fight, Mr McCormac. Drag that bin over, will ya? I'm going to lose a day's takings because of this. That's assuming I get Sean and the boys back any time soon. And I'm not even going to talk about the customers. I never wanted to cause any trouble, Mr McCormac. Please don't send me away. I'll work hard for you - just let me stay with Sean, please. Come on now, you'll be all right. You'll be all right here, why don't you go and... sit back in the caravan, heh? I can help clean up... We don't want anyone seeing you now, do we? Now, come on. We'll be out of Brinford soon enough, and then everything will get back to normal. Now, come along. Thanks, Mr McCormac. Yes, I'll hold. Hello. I've come about the secretarial position? You're too late, I'm afraid. Is the position filled? Well... ..not exactly. Then how can I be too late? Dawson... look after the desk for me, would you? Yes, sir. Please, take a seat, Miss, erm...? Nightingale, Susie Nightingale. Susie. Ooh, hello! All right, behave yourselves! MAN WHISTLES Next time, you'll be up against the magistrates. Yeah, whatever you say. What about the Irish travellers, Sergeant? They can stew for a bit. Let 'em know we don't want their kind here. PHONE RINGS Hello, Brinford Police? Yes. This is WPC Dawson. Thanks again for agreeing to see one last candidate, sir. I'm sure you'll find her very agreeable. For God's sake, Swift, stop your babbling and send her in, will you? Sorry, sir. It's lovely to make your acquaintance, Mr Biggs. Inspector Briggs... Oh! But it... SWIFT CLEARS HIS THROAT I'll leave you to it. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT I type 100 words a minute, do shorthand, of course... and as you can see, I've worked in various offices, so I've got bags of experience! But none with the police. No. But I bet it's dead exciting! I do love a good crime novel. I don't like to brag, but I always guess the killer by the end of the first chapter. Honestly, I am NEVER wrong! Well, what I mean to say is, I'm a quick learner, Inspector Briggs... I work hard, I don't mind staying late if I have to. I don't have a husband to look after so I'll be all yours if you'll have me! Ha-ha! Er, why did you leave your last job? It was my boss. He was getting a bit frisky, if you want the truth. Don't get me wrong, I'm used to batting hands away from me bum, but this one wouldn't take no for an answer. Did I just say bum? Yes. Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Right, well, er, thank you for coming in. Oh, thank you so much, Inspector Briggs, it's been lovely meeting you. When do you think you might make a decision? Er, soon. We'll, er, be in touch. Smashing. I'll look forward to it. Sean? Hello, Tracey. I'm WPC Dawson. Please don't be scared. What do you want? Just to talk. Are you all right? Has anybody hurt you? Of course not, I love being here. That's good. I'm glad you're being looked after. But your parents are worried sick about you. They want you to come home. I can't. Why not? I love my parents, but... I love Sean more. Can't anyone understand that? I do. But you're still a minor. In a few months, I'll be 16, and we're going to get married. It's not as simple as that. You're still going to need your father's permission, and... Well, until then, I'm afraid you can't stay here. You can't force me to go. And Mr McCormac won't let you. I'm sorry, Tracey, you're a good girl... but it's best you go on home now. All right? How come nobody ever dies on the ground floor, hey? Oi! What do you think you're doing? This is a crime scene. I certainly hope so. Or I've been sent to the wrong place. You must be Sergeant Fenton. DI Max Harper. I didn't know you were starting today. Well, ordinarily, I'd take a day or two to get settled in, but your desk sergeant said there was a body. How could I resist? You can drag me home but you'll never stop me seeing Sean. Ah, come on now, you'll forget him soon enough. I'll find him, I'll run away the first chance I get. Come here till I tell you now, listen... You're very welcome to follow us to the next town, and the one after that if you want to. But Seany has a girlfriend in every one of them, and they all think he's going to marry them. Come on, Tracey. Let's go. Thank you. Tracey! Stop! Someone was leaving in a hurry. Yeah Looks like they ran out of time. The landlady rents the room to a Rebecca Jones. Early 20s. You done, Fletcher? Yes, sir. She said she's never seen him before. The tenants aren't allowed visitors. There we are. Councillor Daniel Pembrook. Bit of a come-down, being found in a dump like this. Sapphire Club. Swanky! Members only. Well, that fits. According to Mrs Busybody, Rebecca was a hostess. So, he meets her at work, splashes the cash about, she becomes his tart after-hours. You old romantic. He gets obsessed with her. Shows up, sees her packing her bag to leave, they have a row... He kicks the door in. She scarpers through the window. He can't live without her, so he tops himself. I'm not so sure. He's covered in whisky. There are better ways to murder someone. Quicker and quieter. Unless that was the point. His teeth are broken. So what? Let's just wait for the postmortem report, shall we? Swift! Yes, sir. My report for Assistant Chief Coulson - have you seen it? No, sir. Then, where the hell is it? I left it here, somewhere, now it's just vanished. I can't go on like this. I need a secretary to start first thing tomorrow morning. I know the one I want. Her name was... Blast! Here, here. No... No, no, no, no. It was the one on the top! Perhaps you'd like to sit down, sir? Could you describe her to me? I might remember the name. She was the fourth or fifth one in - dressed in green. Oh! Green! No, I do remember her, sir. That was Miss Nightingale. Shall I give her a call? Thank you, Swift. I'm so sorry, Mrs Nichols. We'll keep a team out looking for her. With any luck, she won't have gone far. Of course. Goodbye. Hi. Have I got the wrong desk? Sorry. I was just leaving. Don't go on my account. DI Max Harper. WPC Dawson. Welcome to Brinford. Excuse me. She always in such a hurry? She had all the time in the world for the last guy. Made any headway on the Pembrook case? Spoke to the wife. Tell her about his bit on the side? Yeah. Fun conversation. Seems he was good at keeping secrets - cleaned out their bank account. Think he owed someone money? Maybe. I'm going to check out this Sapphire Club, see if I can't track down his girl. Right. Well, I'd better come with you, then. I'll let you know when we need uniform on this. Thanks, though. So, you have no idea where she might go? No. I already told you, she's been staying with me. If she's run off, she could be anywhere. I have to find her. She might not be too happy to see you. What do you mean? Well... Slow, quick-quick slow... MUSIC PLAYS You're doing it wrong again. Concentrate. Frame. Slow, quick-quick slow... You're just going at the same speed all the time, Peggy! I'm not! Hiya. How was work? Burnsie left. Some flash Cockney git's taken over. You're doing it wrong again! It's slow, quick-quick slow. That's what I'm doing! No, you're not! Show her how it's done, Sidney, go on. No, no, not now. Go on! She needs to dance with a man! Go on! MUSIC: "El Pato Loco" by Ray Davies And... See? You're getting it now. But keep to the rhythm! Ow! Daddy! Oh, Sidney, you're such a klutz. I'm going the pub. But what about dinner? Er, Sidney! Do it with me, come on. Slow, quick-quick slow. Slow, quick-quick. Oh... You're hopeless! SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS Excuse me, who's in charge here? Chris Hutton. How can I help? Detective Inspector Harper. It's a nice place you've got here. Yeah, thank you. May I ask if you know a Councillor Daniel Pembrook? I believe he was a member. Mr Pembrook was barred. For not paying his tab. Is he in some kind of trouble? You could say that - he's dead. We believe he was acquainted with a young woman who may have worked here - Rebecca Jones? Yeah, I know Rebecca. Is she mixed up in this? We just want to talk to her. Is she here? Er, no, she didn't turn up for her shift yesterday - which isn't unusual, she's not that reliable. Well, if she gets in touch, will you let me know? You can reach me at Brinford Police. Sure. Thanks. Hi. Well, hello. Do you know Rebecca? Rebecca? Not very well. Excuse me. There's my girl! Good evening, Mr Powell. Welcome. Someone's on our table. Sorry, give me one moment. Excuse me, could you...? ♪ I could be the king, yes, the king ♪ I'd be humble or poor ♪ Rich or renowned... ♪ Thank you, good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Sergeant Fenton. It's good to see you. Let's not pretend I... I have a new girl. She's Spanish. She's very striking. I want you. I don't do that any more. Make an exception. I'm saying no. One call from me and I'll have the whole sorry lot of yous hauled off down the nick. 'Operator.' Brinford Police, please. 'Just putting you through.' 'Hello. Brinford Police' Strip. And take your time. Could give a girl some warning, you know. I wear this to do the cleaning. Less talking. Ha-ha-ha-ha! I mean it! I've got a drawer full of lingerie and you never get to see it! Oh, who cares? I prefer to see what's underneath it! All right, now, I know yous were all hoping to stay a wee bit longer, and I was meself. But it's time to cut our losses. So, tomorrow, we pack up and we move on. We're not going anywhere. Sean, where have you been? These lads were released hours ago. Where do you think? Looking for Tracey! All right, that's the meeting over. You go away and get some rest. Big old day tomorrow, huh? How could you? I did what I thought was best. Now, I know you like her... I LOVE her! I have people I'm responsible for, Sean, including you! Now, tomorrow morning, we pack up and we move on, and that is final. And you can go without me. Sean... Sean! You know what I'd really like? If you insist. Get off! Ha-ha-ha! I'll tell you, shall I? I'd like to run a B&B.; Hmm-mm-mm! I'm serious! I'll get a little place by the seaside, fix it up, look after my guests in season, have the rest of the year to myself. Take winter walks on the beach. You'd be bored in five minutes. I wouldn't. Think about it. You, making fry-ups every day for the rest of your life. Hey? Changing all them manky bed sheets? All right, shut up. Mr Powell would never let me quit in any case. I'll tell you what... If it would make you happy... ..go and make me a fry-up. DOOR SLAMS Agh! What is it? Still not found your report, sir? What does it look like? This had better be good, Swift. Miss Nightingale's here, sir. Very well. Send her in. Thank you SO much, Inspector Briggs. I was tickled pink when the phone went! I was worried I'd made a show of myself before... Miss Nightingale... I only get that way when I'm nervous... which doesn't help when you're trying to get a job, does it? Let me stop you there. I'm afraid there's been a mistake. You are NOT the candidate I had in mind. My sergeant obviously called you in error. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. I don't suppose you are very sorry, Inspector Briggs, because you're not the one who's been inconvenienced, are you? W... I had my hair set especially for today. Bought a new pair of shoes, which are pinching me something rotten. I had to get a bus from all the way across town - not once, but twice - only to have my time and money wasted by a bunch of... ..useless men! Is it any wonder you're all so disorganised? I mean, look at this place, it's a disgrace! Oh! And I assume this is what you've been looking for? My report! Spelling's atrocious... PHONE RINGS ..I'll say nothing of your grammar. Chief Inspector Briggs' office! 'Assistant Chief Constable Coulson...' Just one moment, please. Assistant Chief Constable Coulson? Have a nice day... sir. Oh, and by the way, your name's spelled wrong on your door. 'Briggs...! 'Briggs! 'Hello! 'Briggs!' Deal with that, will you? Hello...? Miss Nightingale! I'm sorry, Inspector Briggs, I had no right to have a go at you like that. I've got a temper on me sometimes. You were right to be angry. We are very disorganised, and you are... well... just the woman to straighten us out. The job's all yours - if you still want it. Of course I do! Oh, thank you so much, Inspector Briggs! Mwah! You WON'T regret it. Oh! Fancy a drink? Flying visit. Oh, beautiful. Mike the Mallet! My money's on you Thursday. 'Course it is! Making a comeback, this one. Thanks. Won't let you down. Take a break. Found a body on my patch yesterday. Full of pills and whisky. Anything you want to tell me? Do I look like the kind of man who'd waste a good drink? I hope not. Because there's a new DI sniffing about. Well, thanks for the warning but there's no need. Hey, come up to the house next time. Use the pool. You paid that bookie yet? No. Why? I have a feeling, it's not going to be Maddock's night. Agh! Oi! Come back here. What are you doing there? Tracey! Tracey! Stop! Agh! Tracey! Let her go! Who do you think you are?! Stay out of this! I said let her go! Stop it, stop it, please! Stop it! Tracey! TYRES SCREECH Tracey! Tracey! Agh! Sean! Sean! Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Don't move him! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Sean... Da lied to you. Don't try to talk. Da lied. There was only ever you. I kn... I know. I love you, Tracey. I love you, too. Oh! You just hold on, and you'll be all right. HE CHOKES Sean! Sean! Agh! No! I'm here. Come on. No! Ah! Ah, Seany, no! No! SHE SIGHS I heard what happened. Thought he might cheer you up. Thank you, Tommy. Sir, I've met him. What? A few nights ago. Erm... he was at the funfair. With a woman. What did she look like? Early 20s. Red hair. Pretty. So you'd know if you saw her again? Yes, sir. Can I have a, er, a single to London, please? Thank you. That will be ten shillings and sixpence. Please, hurry. Please, sir, hurry? TANNOY: 'Bus services to London delayed by half an hour.' No, no! Oh! Somebody! Let me go! Somebody help! I thought you might like a lift home. Thank you, sir, but I'll take the bus. I waited especially. You don't want to disappoint me, do you? Please don't do that. Don't play the innocent with me! You and I both know what kind of girl you are. You'll give it up soon enough. Someone! Someone help me!
