 A mysterious dragon-like creature rampages through the jungles of Thailand, destroying croplands and terrifying the people. Gi's friend Newalk tells the Planeteers that some believe it is Phi Pok, a mythological dragon-beast.

 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings  to five special young people -- Kwame from Africa,  with the power of Earth. [ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! ** Come along, my friend. Time to go home. The jungle is no longer safe at night. [ Wind blows ] Did you hear something? Uh, just the wind. [ Wind blowing ]

 But I've never heard the wind sound so frightening before. [ Rumbling ] Hurry, old friend! Hurry! [ Creature growling ] Aye! What was that? [ Creature growling ] Whoa! It's Phi Pok, the dragon beast! The evil spirit has come alive! [ Roars ] ** [ Bird caws ] Kwame: Look at those ruined rice paddies. Ma-Ti: How will those poor people feed themselves now? What could be causing this terrible destruction, Gaia? You must find the answers to these questions, Planeteers. It's up to you. I can tell you that the land and the people are in great danger. You must leave immediately for Thailand. Thailand? I have a friend there. His name is Newalk. I met him in school. Then you can seek his help, Gi. We cannot allow this mysterious evil to continue. Mysterious evil? Wheeler: That's what Gaia said. I wish she could have told us more about what we're getting into. If Gaia does not know what's going on, it must be a real mystery. Check your seat belts, everybody. We're going to land. Wheeler: There's the landing strip. Thailand, here we come. I wouldn't call this a red-carpet welcome. Where is everybody? Maybe they're too shy to come out. Or just unfriendly. Not unfriendly. They're afraid. Gi: Newalk! I was getting worried you wouldn't keep our appointment. I was trying to make the villagers come out of hiding. We should've realized that our Geo-Cruiser might scare them. They thought it was the dragon beast returning. Dragon beast? You're putting us on, right? Come with me. I'll explain. [ Bird squawks ] My people think Phi Pok is destroying the land and crops. What the heck's a Phi Pok? An ancient evil spirit -- a dragon beast that spits fire. It causes destruction wherever it goes. Oh, great! We've come all this way to fight an old superstition that doesn't exist. Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn't. I was taught not to believe in evil spirits, but something here is ruining my homeland. My people believe it is Phi Pok. Linka: Oh, no! This is terrible! Ma-Ti: It's even worse than we saw on the monitors. This was where we grew our food. My people are facing starvation. They want to move away. Of course they want to move away. It's part of my plan. Tell the truth, Rigger. You ever seen a prettier sight than all that ruination? Never, Mr. Greedly. Not in all my born days. Nope, nope, nope! Come on, everybody. Let's get back  to the village. This place is  too depressing. You ain't seen nothing yet, you globe-saving eco-freaks! Once the villagers get spooked by the dragon beast, we're really gonna tear up the territory. I'll chomp up the land, chew it up, and spit it out. I'll hog every ruby I can strip-mine just for myself. [ Laughs ] [ Bird chirps ] [ Tiger growls ] What was that? Watch out. What is the matter, Wheeler? Did the little pussycat scare you? Not scared, Kwame, old pal -- just curious. Back in New Yorkers, they used to say I had nerves of steel. [ Owl hoots ] Yeow! [ Owl hoots ] It appears that in Thailand, your steel nerves have gotten a little rusty. Cute. Real cute. [ Dragon roars ] Huh? [ Gasps ] That is no tiger. [ Growling continues ] [ Indistinct shouting ] Look! Over there! Newalk: It's Phi Pok, the dragon beast! Run! Aah! Wheeler: That's no superstition. What is that thing? [ All scream, shout ] Gi: Look out! The trees are catching fire! It's spreading out of control! Quick! We got to do something! Water! ** Earth! ** The fire is too big! We cannot stop it! It's time to call Captain Planet. Let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Newalk: I'm sorry for getting you into this mess. Gi: No problem. Now that Captain Planet's here, we'll be okay...I hope. Nice day for a dip. What's a nice guy like me doing in a dive like this? Time for a little plumbing job to redirect the river's flow. [ Grunts ] Oh-ho! All right! It's shower time! I'm going to wash that fire right out of the forest. Rain? All right! Go, Planet! [ All cheering ] The fire's out, so I guess I'll be going. Until then, remember, the power is yours! Wow! That's some friend you have. [ Chuckles ] He does come in handy now and then. I apologize, Newalk. I didn't believe that stuff about a Phi Pok dragon beast. But whatever that thing is, it definitely is no superstition. We must discover what this creature is, then. Let's divide into teams and find out. [ Both grunt ] Maybe it was not so smart to split up like this. I kind of like the idea. First time you and I had a chance to be alone. [ Dragon roars ] [ Both gasp ] It's the dragon beast! Run! Whoa! Ugh! Wheeler, help me! What happened? My foot is stuck. It won't move! [ Dragon growling ] Wheeler, run! Save yourself! [ Dragon growling ] Please, Wheeler, run! Get away! Let me show you what we do to evil spirits where I come from. Wheeler, no! Fire! Oops. Guess he's fireproof. That's right! Follow me! Come on, you stupid superstition! Come on! Try and catch me! Hey! Whoa! Aah! [ Dragon roars ] [ Gasps ] Yikes! Crocodiles. I'm out of here! Whew! Oh, no! Hey! Ow! Y-you've got awful sharp teeth for a superstition! At least you scared the crocs away. Looks like good ol' Phi Pok took a prisoner. A Planeteer. He got himself a Planeteer. Yep, yep, yep! I think it's time for a pick-me-up. ** [ Laughs ] [ Snorts ] ** Hey! What's happening? Where is the last place you saw Wheeler? He slipped off there. He must have slid down somewhere. Oh, poor Wheeler! If something has happened to him, I will never forgive myself. [ Cries ] [ Slurps ] Hey! Are you blind or something? Hang a left before we crash into those things! So Phi Pok, that so-called evil spirit, is really a machine. Greedly: A strip-mining machine. As soon as it scares off all the villagers, I'll bring 100 more to the jungle. We'll destroy every living thing and turn the whole countryside into an ugly gravel pit. Yep, yep, yep! The Planeteers won't let you get away with it, Greedly. How can they stop me? They don't even know where I am. And the one who does is our prisoner. Yep, yep, yep! Hey, everybody! Over here. Look at these strange tracks. Evil spirits don't leave tracks. Newalk: They lead into the river. We've lost the trail. I'll check out the bottom of the river. There may be a clue. [ Inhales sharply ] Gi, look out! [ Gasps ] [ Crocodile growls ] Wind. ** Thanks, Linka. He belongs downriver with the rest of his pals. ** Is it safe for Gi to go in now, Ma-Ti? Ma-Ti: Heart! I sense that all the crocodiles are gone. ** See anything? Just a lot of marks on some rocks, as if something heavy was dragged away. That is all? No sign of Wheeler? No. Perhaps Wheeler's thoughts can guide us to him. Heart! Ma-Ti: I sense evil.  It is all around him. Wait. There is something  in his mind, something he saw. Three tall spires...  some kind of ruins. What about Wheeler? I sensed his presence, but evil thoughts blocked my vision. We're never going to find him. The three spires you saw, Ma-Ti, they must be part of a temple. Why? You know of some ruins that look like that? Yes. The ancient temple of the rubies. Greedly: Fill 'er up fast, Rigger. It's time to scare off some more locals. Can we ruin more farmland? Can we, Mr. Greedly? Huh? Huh? Next time, we'll ruin everything in sight. There's the temple of the rubies. Yes! Those were the spires in Wheeler's mind. I still sense his presence surrounded by evil. Is there any way to get inside without being seen? Legend says the temple has a secret underwater entrance. If there is, I'll find it. Mr. Greedly, look! Them Planeteers pests are coming to spoil our fun. You're wrong, Rigger. We're going to spoil theirs. ** The Phi Pok will fix them. Yep, yep, yep! You'd better call that dragon machine off, Greedly. What are you gonna do about it, punk? [ Gasps ] ** Hey! I didn't give you permission to leave. Hey! You heard Mr. Greedly! Stop! So, you want to play games? Water! There's an underground river outside that will teach you a lesson. Hey! Those walls are supposed to keep the water out! Aah! Nice going, Gi. Those slobs could use a bath. [ Both gasp ] Save me, Mr. Greedly! [ Coughs ] Save me! Go soak your head! I'm saving myself! ** Wheeler, thank goodness you are safe! Hey, if I'd known you'd act like this, I'd get myself captured all the time. Well done, Gi! [ Dragon roars, all gasp ] Run, everybody! The beast is back! Run to the canoe! [ All gasp ] Kwame: Now what? Gi: We can't outrun it. And my power couldn't stop it. Let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Time to branch out! [ Dragon screeches ] I'm feeling vine. [fine] How about you? ** That dragon's a real drag. Round two coming up. ** [ Whoosh! ] ** Greedly should have told him to watch his step. Hey! Ouch! Ouch! Stop it! Let's get out of here, Rigger! That's what you get when you try to turn the world into a gravel pit. [ All cheer ] What a waste! Best way to clean up litter is to recycle it. Voilà! A brand-new planting machine. Thanks, Captain Planet. This will help us replant the rice paddies. So long, Planeteers. You did a fine job. And remember, the power is yours! All: Go, Planet! ** Newalk: My people and I cannot thank you enough, Planeteers. No thanks are necessary. Protecting the planet is our job. And because it's a job everyone needs to be involved in, we're making you an honorary Planeteer. Oh, thank you. Please come again...soon! We will. Goodbye, Newalk. I'm gonna miss this place. Hmm. I thought you did not want to come here. That was before you hugged me. I had no choice, Yankee. It was either you or the dragon beast. All: Go, Planet! Kwame: This place looks terrible. Nothing will grow here. I know, Kwame. Many forms of mining destroy the land. But there's something you can do that will stop more of our beautiful Earth from looking like this. Instead of throwing away your aluminum cans, foil, and other reusable metals, take them to a collection center. Be a Planeteer. Recycle! All: We do! The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
