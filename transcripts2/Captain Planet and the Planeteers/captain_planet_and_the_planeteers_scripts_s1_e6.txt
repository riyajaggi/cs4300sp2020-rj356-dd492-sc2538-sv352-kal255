 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings  to five special young people -- Kwame from Africa,  with the power of Earth. [ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! [ Wind howling ] Linka: Chort vozmi! Whoa! Major rock 'n' roll! Good thing there aren't people on that island. But there are animals, and the fire and dust that meteor has unleashed will kill them unless you help. At least it does not threaten the entire planet.

 I am not so sure, Linka. I sense great, great danger. Gi: Look at that cloud of dust and smoke! This island looks like it's been hit by a nuclear bomb! Shh. It's dark. A tropical sun cannot penetrate this dust cloud. [ Monkey shrieking ] Ma-Ti: Now it is getting hot! Gi, you must stop those flames! Water! [ Twinkle! ] I cannot stop it! Wind! It should be a breeze to blow out that fire, like blowing out a candle. [ Twinkle! ] Oh, it is too much. I cannot blow it out! What we need is a firebreak. I'll burn out this blaze! Fire! That should keep it from spreading. [ Gasps ] Oh, no! It jumped my firebreak! Earth! I will show you how to make a firebreak, Wheeler. [ Zap! Zap! Zap! ] Way to go, Kwame! [ All gasp ] Our powers are not enough! Gi: This fire is bigger than any of us can handle alone! Then let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! ** By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! The heat is on! Get under cover, Planeteers, 'cause a hard rain's gonna fall. [ Twinkle! ] [ Coughing ] Smoke gets in your eyes. [ All cheering ] ** Got to bolt! Ma-Ti: Captain Planet has whipped up a typhoon! [ Wind howling ] Thank you, Captain Planet! You are one incredible firefighter! Well, a fire that big you have to take by storm. See you later! The power is yours! [ Twinkle! Twinkle! ] [ Twinkle! Twinkle! Twinkle! ] Look -- down in the crater! There is the cause of all this destruction. [ All murmur, gasp ] Whatever that is, it's no meteorite. It's -- It's... Greetings, warriors of Planet Earth. I am Zarm. I've watched you use your powers with great interest. A being from another planet! How come you know our language? It is a simple language. Is this an invasion, like in the movies? No. I cannot even venture into your environment. But you may step into mine. We really should ask Gaia first. She is the spirit of our planet. What a meek spirit she must be to have such timid followers. Gaia is not meek, and neither are we! Right?! I don't know. I don't like the sound of this. Well, anyway, I'm no chicken. Wheeler, come back! Don't! Listen. Not one of you had enough power to stop that firestorm, but I can make your powers far stronger. Next time you could stop such a fire yourselves. [ Twinkle! ] He's got a point. Maybe we should try it. Well, at least we can go along and keep Wheeler out of trouble. Linka! Gi! No! We must stick together! Enter freely, of your own will. I do not trust him. Zarm's heart is so...empty. Behold the wonders of my planet. [ Gong crashes ] This is very much like Gaia's Planet Vision. My people control the land, the sea, and the air, and now space is our new frontier. [ Chuckles ] Earth will very soon reach our stage. That is why I have come -- to find Earthlings whom I can teach our advanced ways. I have chosen you Planeteers to wear these. They will increase your power over the elements a hundredfold. I'd have 100 times the scorch power? What of you, Ma-Ti? You can control the hearts of the world with this. Gaia gave us all the power we need, Wheeler. We should not do anything until we talk to her. Come on, Ma-Ti. I'm sure Gaia would okay it. What's wrong with having more power? As Zarm said, we couldn't stop that fire ourselves. Hmm. My hand won't go in. Zarm: I think you need to remove your ring. But Gaia gave us these rings! Well, if you're afraid... I am not afraid! I'm not so sure you should do that, Wheeler. Hey, we're Planeteers. We can take care of ourselves. [ Warble! ] Excellent. [ Warble! ] [ Warble! ] I shall give you your command words and watch you try out your new superpowers. For now, I can only speak to you from my spacecraft. First, let's see Gi use her water power. Waters of conquest! [ Warble! Gong! ] Oh, wow! A tidal wave! It must be half a mile high! Zarm: A big one, yes, but you can stop her wave, Linka. Try it. Winds of conquest! [ Warble! ] [ Chuckles ] Gi, your wave is gone with the wind. It certainly is, my dear. But come now, Kwame. Surely you can top a girl. Earth of conquest! [ Gong! Warble! ] Fantastic! That makes Linka's tornado look like a mere sneeze. Not bad, Kwame. But I bet Wheeler can turn your island into a cinder. Sure! Watch! Fires of conquest! [ Gong! Warble! ] [ Laughs ] Too bad, Kwame. I just roasted your real estate. Don't be such a wise guy, Wheeler. I could douse your flame in a second. Oh, really? Yes, really. Perfect! You're learning real cutthroat competition. If you want the best, you must fight for it. Zarm tempts my friends with the power of the iron fist. But why? Heart! Ma-Ti, what is wrong? Zarm, what we Planeteers want is to save the Earth. Is not war the worst threat to Earth? I suppose that is true. Well, I can show you how to eliminate all nuclear missiles. How? Destroy them yourselves! You can begin with an army base on the mainland. But do we have the right to destroy something like that? Right?! Ha! Might makes right. You must either conquer or be conquered! I do not want to be conquered. Then I'll vaporize 'em! Nyet! I shall be the one! Kwame: No. It should be me. Gi: No way! After Zarm gave them the iron fists, they started arguing with each other. Did you say, "Zarm"? That's right. Gaia. It's been ages since we've seen each other. Yes, it has been ages, Zarm, but not nearly long enough. Gaia, how do you know this alien? Zarm is no alien. Long ago, he was a spirit of the Earth, like me. But he left in search of other worlds. Yes, but now I am back... with new followers -- your Planeteers. Already they fight each other for power. They wear my iron fist, not your ring. I don't believe it. With the Planeteers taking my orders, even your Captain Planet is helpless against my unearthly powers. Captain Planet! Now, in this power matrix, he will be my prisoner as Earth itself comes to an end. Linka: I will go first. I will drive off all of these soldiers and make the missile base useless. Winds of conquest! [ Warble! Gong! ] Aaah! [ Glass breaking ] [ Laughs ] My power really blows them away! Linka, no! Gaia! What is wrong? What is happening to you? The Planeteers must not abandon the way of peace. If they do, I will become mortal and the Earth itself could die. [ Wind howling ] There go the last of them. Well? You did not finish the job. The launch equipment is still there. But I can solve that permanently. Waters of conquest! [ Warble! Gong! ] ** Surf's up... and down. Oh, no. Not Gi, too. [ Laughs evilly ] One by one, they abandon you, Gaia. Soon you will be a mere mortal, and I will be the spirit of the Earth. Gaia! Do something! No, Ma-Ti. You must contact Kwame and Wheeler. Convince them to stop. Heart! Wheeler! Kwame! Stop! You must not choose Zarm over Gaia! No, Ma-Ti! We will not stop! Now you have lost Wheeler and Kwame. It is no use! Ma-Ti! Come back! [ Sniffs ] I will not give up. Even as a mortal, I can still show the Planeteers what Zarm is really like. Come, my conquerors! Show me which one of you is the greatest warrior. [ Sniffles ] Oh, no, Gaia. You are mortal! Believe me, I feel mortal. Now I must get to the missile base. You cannot go there now! Your life would be in danger! I know. But peace requires a brave heart. [ Sighs ] All right. I will get us a ride. Heart! Gi: Admit it -- I made a clean sweep of that missile base. Ha! The missiles are still in their silos, but I will unearth them. Earth of conquest! [ Gong! Warble! ] [ Metal creaking ] For those of you keeping score, this is a 9.0 quake. That is how you shake up a missile base. Well, I don't want to shake you up, pal, but the missiles are still in one piece. Step aside and let an expert blow those warheads to atoms! Fires of con-- Wheeler! Stop! Gaia and Ma-Ti are standing in the way! And Gaia looks solid, like us! She looks...human. Linka's right! I could have fried her! Let us find out what is going on. Gaia, why are you blocking us? Don't you want us to get rid of nuclear weapons? You will trigger retaliation. Zarm only gave you those superpowers to trick you into starting a nuclear war. Ma-Ti, how could you think that? Gaia, you meddler! I will show you what it means to be mortal. [ Zap! Zap! Zap! ] Planeteers! Ugh! Gaia! You see what can happen when destruction is your method? [ Grunts ] It is true. You are not a spirit. You are bleeding! The more you Planeteers use Zarm's violent powers, the closer it will be to the end of the Earth and of me. Zarm did not tell you what really happened to his last world. All their advanced science was used to make war. Nuclear war broke out. Nothing on the planet was spared. Smoke and dust filled the skies, cutting off all sunlight. In a few years, this nuclear fallout left Zarm's world a lifeless cinder, utterly destroyed. That is what Zarm planned for Earth! And we were going to help him! I do not know what to say. I do. I am sorry, Ma-Ti. Me, too. I guess we all went on a power trip and lost our heads. I'm sorry, everybody. What is this sentimental slop? Where are my young conquerors?! I am not a conqueror. I am a Planeteer. Fine. Someone else will rule if you do not. This world needs an iron fist. That is the last thing it needs. I have felt really miserable since I had this thing on. A peacemaker must have great courage. Wheeler, listen to me! Follow me. You can rule the world. I don't want your kind of world! Ungrateful brats! If you will not fight, I will start the war myself! I will launch a few choice missiles. Each country will counterattack, and this planet will self-destruct! Gaia, what can we do? Zarm has captured Captain Planet, and you must free him. You bet we will! Let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! ** What is that? [ Twinkle! ] By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! ** Now to take care of that major-league draft. Zarm: Captain Planet? The Planeteers rescued him? Yes, sir, and I heard you wanted to play some games. So, here you go! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Ma-Ti: Gaia! You are a spirit again! You might say seeing you all back together has restored my spirit. You aren't rid of me yet, Captain Planet. I think it's time the spirit of Earth gave Captain Planet a hand. ** [ Twinkle! ] Nooooooooooooooooo! [ Twinkle! ] [ Grunts ] Let's play ball! The wind-up and the pitch. Captain Planet swings. Crack! It's a line drive into deep left space! It's gone! You made your planet a wasteland, Zarm! Now go live there! Dasvidaniya, Zarm, and good riddance! I wonder, if visitors ever arrive from other worlds, will they be like Zarm? I doubt it. If they can't learn how to live in peace, they'll blow themselves up before they get here. The important thing is that we should learn to live in peace on our own planet so that if travelers do come from space, they'll have a nice place to visit. To save the planet, we need to work together... and share. Sure, Gaia. We get the hint. Your turn. Captain Planet: The power is yours. ** Planeteers: Go, Planet! It isn't just grown-ups who help destroy our planet. Wheeler: Some kids do it with graffiti. Gi: Some kids do it with vandalism. Linka: And some do it when they don't stop to think. Gaia: Earth can be like this or like this. We can destroy it with our hate... Or save it with our love. The power is yours. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
