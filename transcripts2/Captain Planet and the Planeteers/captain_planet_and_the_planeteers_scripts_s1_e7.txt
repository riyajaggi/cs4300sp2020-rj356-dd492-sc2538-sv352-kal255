 Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990â€“1996): Season 1, Episode 7 - Last of Her Kind - full transcript 
 Kwame is shocked to see greedy businessman Looten Plunder and his right-hand man Argos Bleak are poaching Africa's elephants. Wheeler considers the trip an opportunity to buy Linka an ivory necklace as a birthday gift. The Planeteers go to free the creatures and also try to find an elephant cub's mother. But one of the problems facing them is that some Africans feel desperate enough to need to accept Plunder's jobs even if it means sacrificing all of their animal neighbors - and hurting themselves in the long term - as he would have them do...

 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet.

[ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 [ Elephant trumpets ] ** [ British accent ] Ivory on the hoof. Round it up! [ Elephants trumpeting ] [ Elephant squealing ] Drive them to slaughterhouse, Balo. Yes, sir, Mr. Bleak. [ Elephants trumpeting ] [ Elephant trumpets ] [ All trumpeting ] [ Elephant crying ] Balo! That big mama's going back for her baby! [ Elephants trumpeting ] ** Can't let a big one like that get away. She's big bucks in Looten Plunder's big pockets! [ Elephants trumpeting ] ** [ Tool whirring ] [ Laughs ] Another fine haul for my factory. From tail to tusk, I'll turn those elephants into profit -- trunks of it! [ Laughs ] And no one can stop me! [ Laughs ] [ Elephant trumpets ] [ Warbling ] ** Wheeler: If you were trying to impress a babe, Ma-Ti, what would you get her for her birthday? You speak of Linka, my friend? No. Yeah. Well, maybe you could tune into her mind and see what that ruskie babe would like. Planeteers,  to the crystal chamber. We have an eco-emergency! Come on, Ma-Ti. When the spirit of Earth calls, we got to boogie! Wheeler, be careful with the sail! Aah! Oh! [ Laughs ] Come, my wet-head comrades! We must hurry! However you decide to impress Linka, that was not the way to do it! Forget it, dude. I'll think of something. Kwame: Earth is in trouble, Gaia? Entire herds of our noble animal friends are being murdered. [ Elephants trumpeting ] I thought elephants were big enough to take care of themselves. Not against men as cruel as Looten Plunder and his evil henchmen. They are in my homeland, in Africa! Yes, Kwame. And if Looten Plunder continues to turn the elephants into trinkets, your homeland will lose them forever. I can't imagine a world without elephants. Then let my crystal monitor show you how it would be. A creature that has beautified Earth so much would vanish into dust. Hurry, Gi! We must get to Africa in time to stop Looten Plunder! If you can go any faster, then you drive! Yo! Ma-Ti! This going to Africa gives me an awesome idea for Linka's present. Worry about the job we must do, not about impressing babes! Who's worried? She'll be impressed. What chick wouldn't flip for an ivory necklace? Are you crazy, Wheeler? Yeah, like a fox. Everyone knows Africa's the best place to get ivory real cheap. Cheap? Are you kidding? [ All scream ] Gi: Hang on. I'm taking us down. I've just spotted two of Looten Plunder's henchmen attacking a herd of elephants! Wheeler, you are about to find out what ivory really costs. [ Elephants trumpeting ] Ha ha ha! We got them! They're heading for the pit trap! [ Trumpeting continues ] We'll make them stop chasing the elephants and start chasing us! Aah! Gi: Your poaching days are over! The Planeteers are here! Way to go, Gi! You're driving them off. Kwame: Look! One of the elephant has fallen into a trap! Get down there, Gi. We've got to save him! [ Grunts ] [ Elephant trumpeting ] Earth! ** [ All cheer ] Aah! Aah! That should wrap up this little skirmish. Now the elephants are ours! Ha ha! Stop! [ Elephants trumpet ] Stop! Leave them alone! Go away, kid. You bother me! [ Chuckles ] Oh! [ Laughs ] Aah! Let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined... ...I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! [ Elephant trumpets ] Stop! Stop! [ Trumpeting continues ] Whoa! Thank you, Captain Planet! No problem, Kwame. And now I'd better coach two poachers on their manners. ** Help! Get me out of here! Mr. Bleak: Hey! Where did this tornado come from? What's going on? Just simple ecology! Aah! Who said that? Aah! Ohh! Aah! Captain Planet: Consider yourselves grounded. Oh! Oh! [ Both grunt ] And I guess that means you won't be needing these. All right! Whoo! I'd love to stay and shoot the breeze, gang. But I need to take these elephants to safety and then return to the Earth. But what if we need you again? Just give me a ring. I'll be ready. The power is yours! Now what? Now we find Looten Plunder's slaughterhouse and out it out of business. ** [ Elephant sneezes ] [ Gasps ] What's that? Who's there? Come on out or eat fire! Wait one second, Yankee. [ Elephant squealing ] It's a baby elephant! [ Elephant sneezes ] Ma-Ti: Oh, the poor little sneezer. She's terrified! I wonder what happened to her. Perhaps my power to sense her thoughts will tell us. Heart! Loud sky noises, bad men. Her mother -- gone! Looten Plunder has Sneezer's mother! We've got to hurry before it's too late! We'll help you, little Sneezer. We'll help you. Looten: So, those meddling Planeteers think they can stop Looten Plunder, do they? I want those environmental midgets stopped. Prepare the snatcher! [ Elephant trumpets ] What is it, Sneezer? What's wrong? [ Gasps ] What is that? Watch out! [ Elephant trumpets ] It's as much fun poaching Planeteers as it is poaching elephants! I have had enough of this! Earth! Thanks, Kwame. That should stop it. That could sure be handy in New York traffic. Linka: Hurry! Run! Into that cave! Looten: [ Laughs ] If there's anything I like more than being mean, it's being sneaky! [ Elephant trumpets ] It's a trap! Of course it's a trap! Let us out, or I'll fry you like the scrawny chicken you are! Sorry, Planeteers. Fire! This door is fireproof! He's right! There's no way I can burn that door down. How are we going to get out of here? [ Laughs ] Wait till you discover the rest of my surprises. [ Breathing heavily ] We got here as soon as we could, Mr. Plunder. It was a long walk! No excuses, Bleak! I'm deducting the cost of those air rovers Planet destroyed from both your salaries. But, Mr. Plunder, how will I feed my family? Very unsuccessfully... unless you do what I say. Bleak, you and the snatcher make sure these Planeteer punks stay put. Affirmative. Balo, with the Planeteers out of our way, it's time to speed up the elephant poaching. I want every last elephant in Africa rounded up -- every last one! [ Laughs ] Yes, Mr. Plunder. Ma-Ti: What do we do now? We cannot call Captain Planet from in here. We have our own powers. We can get out of here ourselves. Then we'll call Cap. Oh, that's easy to say but hard to do. I think I know how to show that putrid Looten Plunder that he's all wet! Kwame, Linka! Help me turn that pool into a raging river. You first, Kwame. Earth! Water! Linka: Wind! It's working! ** [ Laughs ] We're free! Not quite, Yankee. Bleak: Now I can pay you back for what you did to my air rover! Now? Now. Let our powers combine! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Hi, guys! Well, I guess it's time to wash the dirty laundry. Whoa! Whoa! Not again! All: Go, Planet! Talk later, Planeteers! I've gotta bolt! ** First, to free the elephants. And behind door number one... elephants! And behind door number two -- more elephants! And behind door number three -- one very surprised villain. Sorry, you lose, but thanks for playing our game, huh? [ Gasps ] My factory! My elephants! My bank balance! You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! [ Elephant trumpets ] we'll find your mother, Sneezer. I promise. Uh, Kwame, I-I think I figured out what you meant about the cost of ivory. It's not just money, is it? No, Wheeler. They kill elephants to get ivory. That's what could happen to Sneezer's mother? Oh, and I wanted to get Linka an ivory necklace. Am I one stupid dude! I will take the little elephant with me! Why, my brother? Why must you kill the elephants? Why can't you leave them be? My people are poor! I need Looten Plunder's money, or my family will perish. [ Elephant screams ] But soon there will be no elephants left. What then? I do not know. We can teach you, my brother, show you other ways to survive. I have already wasted too much time in foolish talk! Move, elephant! [ Elephant screams ] No! I won't let you! You cannot take Sneezer! Kwame, no! We've given our powers to Captain Planet! Ooh! Save your pretty words. I have no choice! Balo, my brother. There is a choice. Listen to your heart! Give yourself up, Looten. I'm closing you down! You've ruined my factory, my business! And it's people like you who ruin the Earth. I'm sending you to prison, Looten! Never, Captain Planet! I'm sending you to the showers -- showers of pure acid rain, that is! Sorry, Looten. I already had a bath today. Give it up, Plunder. Where is that slippery poacher? Keep moving! What is it? What's wrong? [ Gasps ] A trap! You... You saved my life. It's has not been a life I am proud of, little friend. Perhaps it is time I change it. ** Oh, Balo! There you are. I order you to stop Captain Planet. No! What are you saying? I-I-I'll pay you anything you ask. There are better ways than taking your orders and your money! We have caused enough pain. The killing must stop! [ Elephant trumpets ] You'll regret this, Balo. Mark my words! [ Screaming ] [ Laughs ] You did the right thing, Balo. Will Kwame keep his promise? Can you really teach us to survive without poaching? Earth's honor. [ Vehicle approaching ] That's it, Balo. Bring in the soil. By learning new skills and learning better ways to farm, the villagers can survive without poaching elephants. Thank you, Captain Planet. Thank you, Planeteers. The power is yours! All: Go, Planet! Here you go, Sneezer. It's your mom. [ Elephants trumpet ] ** Bye, sneezer! Bye, sneezer! Gosh, Linka, we've been so busy, I didn't get a chance to buy you something for your birthday. Sorry, babe. Linka: Seeing Sneezer and her mother back together is the best present I could get. In America, when you get a present, you got to give back kisses. In Soviet Union, when boys give you fast move, you give back fast nyet! [ Chuckles ] Well, Wheeler, as you Americans say, you can kiss that idea goodbye! [ Laughter ] I'm Captain Planet. All: And we're the Planeteers. You can be a Planeteer, too, by helping to making our world a better place to live for everyone who shares our planet. Ma-Ti: Including our wild animal friends like Sneezer, who are being killed to make jewelry, souvenirs, and fur coats. So tell your friends not to buy things that required an animal to give its life. We mustn't plunder  our planet. The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
