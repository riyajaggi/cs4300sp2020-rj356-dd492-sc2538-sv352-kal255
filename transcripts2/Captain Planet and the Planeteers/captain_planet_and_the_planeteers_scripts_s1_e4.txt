 Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990â€“1996): Season 1, Episode 4 - Skumm Lord - full transcript 
 Verminous Skumm creates a substance that, when placed in water, will mutate its drinker into a rat-resembling character who willingly serves him. The Planeteers go to stop him, but Wheeler falls into a vat of it, and Linka and Gi are splashed, so the others must hurry to recover an endangered plant Ma-Ti's friend the Shaman believes may cure them. Meanwhile, Skumm plans to place the liquid in Ma-Ti's village water supply, then the Amazon to infect the country and perhaps even the world.

 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings  to five special young people -- Kwame from Africa,  with the power of Earth. [ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! [ Bird cawing ] I cannot wait for you to meet him. The shaman knows everything about the Amazon rainforest. He knows which plants are poisonous, what you can eat, and which ones can be used for medicine. What fun is a silly old shaman and a bunch of stupid old plants?

 But this plant! This plant is bodacious! [ Tarzan yell ] [ Smack ] A snake! Aah! Ooh! Whoa! That was close! Ouch! Ouch! Ants! Ow! Ah! Ooh! Ouch! Eek! Ooh! I'm burning! Those crazy ants thought I was lunch! Fire ants. I can help you. Wheeler! Here, try this. What's that? What are you doing? Relax! It will help the pain. Thanks. That does feel better. Where'd you learn that? Just something the silly old shaman taught me. Oh, yeah...him. Where is he? [ Whistling ] There! That is the shaman! Come! Ma-Ti: Shaman! Ma-Ti! It is good to see you! These are my friends the Planeteers! -Hey, how you doing? -Hello! What is this magic? It is Gaia. Return to Hope Island,  Planeteers. We have an eco-emergency. You must go? Yes. I am sorry our visit was so short, shaman. You will be back, my son, very soon. Linka: Verminous Skumm! [ Speaks Russian ] I am sick! I have no idea what you just said, Linka, but I know I agree. What's that big rat Skumm up to now? Worse than usual, I'm afraid. Look! He and his rat pack are spreading a terrible disease, an evil illness called rat rot. Wait till you taste my skummy brew! [ Gagging ] [ Gasps, screams ] Huh. Yah! [ Laughs evilly ] [ Whistles ] Gaia: Now she's under Verminous Skumm's power. Gi: How awful! The rat rot epidemic is spreading all over the city. You've got to work fast, Planeteers. The hopes of Earth go with you. ** [ Chattering ] Heart! Down there. There is a young boy with the disease. Quick! Let us follow him! ** Come on, dudes! We're losing him! Heart! There! Kwame: This must be where Verminous Skumm makes his germ-filled drink. [ Coughing ] [ Gagging ] Perfect! This will put hair on anybody's chest! Rat hair! Yeah. [ Chuckles evilly ] There are barrels and barrels of that stuff. Those poor people. We've got to find some way to change them back to normal. First, we must shut this place down permanently. Earth! [ Rumbling ] Hey. Hey, hey! You'll pay for this, you meddling punk-eteers! [ Whistling ] [ Hissing ] Linka: We are surrounded, my friends! Too many for us to stop! Run! ** Head to the light! Rat pack, get them! Let our powers combine! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! [ Sniffing ] Verminous Skumm! I knew something smelled bad here! Better air this place out! Sorry, but I can't let you do Skumm's evil work. My evil work's just starting, windbag! That environmental goody-goody Captain Planet thinks he's ruined my party. I'll show him the fun's just begun! Wheeler: Verminous Skumm is gone! Way to go, Cap! Verminous Skumm: Oh, Captain Planet? Get a little taste of this! [ Grunts ] Not rat rot! [ Chuckles evilly ] Captain Planet, are you all right? Planeteers, I'm weakening. You must find Skumm and stop him from spreading this horrible disease and help find the cure. Hurry. Time is short. Remember, the power is yours! Oh, great! That sounds easy! No time for sarcasm, Wheeler. You, Linka, and I will look for Skumm. Ma-Ti and Kwame, you look for the cure. Agreed? All: Agreed! ** Verminous Skumm: Open the hangar doors. Now I'll pollute the whole river with my skummy brew, and soon the entire city will be mine! [ Hisses ] Okay, here's the river. Get ready to spray the rat rot...now! Look! There is the Skumm-O-Copter! Let's get him! Quick, reload! More germs! More germs! I love being a rat. Come on, guys! Let's put that retro rodent out of business! Don't you think we should make a plan? -Wheeler! -Wheeler! Hey! Fire! I don't like people messing with the Skumm-O-Copter! [ Whistles ] Too bad, fur-face! I'm gonna mess with more than that! Hey! Put me down! Hey! Oh, no! Wheeler! Put me down! Put me down! By all means! [ Whistles ] Aaaah! -No! -No! Take my hand, Wheeler! Yuck! Quick! Both of you! Here! Did you swallow any? Did you? -No! -No way! Good! [ Whistles ] Get them! [ Rumbling ] Wheeler: The Geo-Cruiser! We're saved! Quick! Climb the rope! Did you not hear me? Grab on! I feel weird! What's -- Hsssss! Yeeaahh! Linka! Wheeler! Gi! We must go now! What is wrong with you? [ All hissing ] Aah! [ All hissing ] It is too late, Ma-Ti. There is no cure for rat rot! What can we do? Nothing! They're all mine now! [ Whistles ] Welcome to the rodent rebellion. We must rescue our friends. I'll move in closer. Try to catch them! ** Load this chopper! Fast! Quick, Ma-Ti! Pull up! [ Squealing ] You're rat history, Planeteers! ** Oh, no! He is right behind us! Ma-Ti, where are we going? I am taking them to the shaman. Maybe he knows of a cure. I think I know a way to lose him. Ohhhh! Maybe this is not such a good idea! [ Squealing ] Have you ever done this before? Yes, of course. Well, not really. Once at Hope Island... on the flight simulator. Aaah! Good going, Ma-Ti! We lost Skumm! I got to pull myself together! What am I, a rat or a mouse? I'm a rat! With my cheesy homing device, wherever they go, I can sniff them out. Verminous is still back there. Not past this next turn. We are going through that? I hope so. On the simulator, I never did make it. We part ways here, planet punks, but I'll be back. Rat's honor! Outstanding! Skumm has turned around! We have lost him. Now we must find the shaman and help our friends. [ All hissing, growling ] Ma-Ti: Will anything help them, shaman? Shaman: There was a plant that might help, a very rare plant. But now it may be gone. -Gone! -Gone! Much of our rainforest is destroyed and, along with it, many valuable plants we used as medicine. This is where the plant that might cure rat rot used to grow. This is private property! I am looking for a rare plant that used to grow here, bright purple leaves? Plants? Get off my place, old man! This land's getting used for what it does best -- raising beef cattle. [ Screeching ] Shh, Suchi, shh! It is a horrible thing they are doing to the forest. Wait! Here's the plant! We must hurry and see if this will help your friends. [ All hissing ] Patience, rodent-teers. I'll set you free. Lucky I was able to trace you here. Get to work, rat-brats! Dump that in the village water supply now! I better get going if I want to infect the whole Amazon by dark. [ Hissing ] They are gone! Heart! The animals say Wheeler, Linka, and Gi will infect the village's water supply! Stop them, my friends! [ Bird screeching ] ** [ Chattering ] [ Bird screeching ] [ Squealing ] Good work! You saved our village! I have mixed the cure for rat rot. Let them breathe the vapor. Nothing's happening! Patience. I'm well! I'm well! Quick. Let's give the medicine to the others. [ Both hissing ] Try it. You'll like it. That was one bad dream! More like nightmare. Thanks, Ma-Ti. Those plants saved our lives. Sorry I called them stupid. Oh, no! I just remembered what Skumm said! He's infecting the whole Amazon! We will stop him! Spray a few thousand gallons of rat rot brew, and every person in the Amazon will answer to me, and then I'll take care of those meddling Planeteers once and for all. Now to head upriver and do a little more damage! ** [ Gasps ] Look at the river! Ma-Ti: That whole village will be infected! Wind! Earth! We cannot stop it alone! Let our powers combine! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! ** This rat rot really burns me up! Now to find the big rat who did this and exterminate his plans! This looks like a dandy spot to infect all of South America! Huh? What's going on? I'm putting you and your rat rot routine in permanent quarantine, Skumm! Aah! Aah! Aah! Shaman: We need much more of this plant to cure all the victims of rat rot. If it's out there, I'll find it! ** All right! It's the medicine plant! Acres of it! This will clear the land a whole lot faster than my bulldozer! Oh, no, that fire will destroy the only plants that can cure this disease! A quick storm will stop it! Hey! What is this? It's time to think about the rainforest as more than just grazing land, mister. Help! Once a rainforest is gone, it's gone forever. I better get this medicine plant back to where it's needed. Now to spray the shaman's cure faster than Skumm sprayed the disease! [ All squealing ] Ahh. [ Laughs ] And this plant is very good for toothache. You're back! Did it... Yes, shaman, your special medicine cured rat rot everywhere! Way to go, Cap! Just think, if those ranchers had burned down the forest... Rat rot would be here to stay. Hey, Planet! What are you gonna do with me? Hmm. Good question. It's either the police station or the zoo. The zoo! The zoo! That sounds good. They never have rat exhibits in the zoo. Start a new trend! Wheeler: Say cheese, you rat! All: Go, Planet! They are cutting down more rainforest, Captain Planet! Captain Planet: They world's rainforests are being destroyed at the rate of a football field a second. Gi: What can we do about it? Don't use paper products that are only used once and thrown away. You can recycle newspapers so that new trees won't have to be cut down to make wood pulp. And stand beside the people who are standing up for our forests! The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours!
