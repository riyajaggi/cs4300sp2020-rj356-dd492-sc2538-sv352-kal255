 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings  to five special young people -- Kwame from Africa,  with the power of Earth. [ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! Any sign of Dr. Blight? Not yet, but this is where Gaia said we should look for her. Your American countryside is beautiful, Wheeler. Yeah, and I don't want Dr. Blight to ruin it. Keep your eyes peeled. There's no telling what she's up to. Ready for my next  evil assignment, Dr. Blight.

 You do bad so well, MAL. No wonder you're my favorite computer. Go ahead. Analyze the air. Air quality good. Yech! I hate clean air. It makes people so healthy. But we'll soon have a remedy for that, won't we, my little microchip? You're the doctor, Doctor. [ Chuckles ] Now to work... although I really think of it as playtime. Are you ready, my little smoglet? I thought I was  your little darling. Oh, you'll always be number one with me, MAL. But if my feeling is right, this little smog blob is going to create more damage than anything we've ever done! All it needs is a tasty morsel of carbon monoxide to complete our final test. [ Gasps ] Here comes breakfast now. Diesel fuel à la school bus. Mmm! I love the smell of pollution. [ Children laughing ] "Super Kid, boy superhero, knew he had his work cut out for him." I want to read that comic book, squirt! Hey, give that back, or you'll be sorry! Forget it. You can only read about heroes. You're too chicken to be one. I am not! Go get them, little smoglet! My invention's working! My experimental smog blob is absorbing the exhaust from the bus [gasps] and growing larger. You want it, shrimp? Here! You can have it! [ Coughing ] Where did all this smog come from? [ Gasps ] I can't see where I'm going! Oh, no! The brakes aren't working! What would Super Kid do? Turn on the headlights! No, don't! That's the door! [ Gasps ] [ Coughing ] Planeteer alert! Someone is in trouble! I can feel it nearby. There! That school bus! It's trapped inside a smog cloud -- a very unusual smog cloud. Hang on! We're going down! They are headed straight for that cliff! Aah! Aah! Help! Earth! Way to go, Kwame! Let's get down there and see if they're okay. [ Coughing ] Out of my way, lamebrain! [ Coughs ] I don't know who you are, but I sure thank you for saving our lives. No sweat, ma'am. All in a day's work. You mean you guys do hero stuff like that all the time? Yeah, pretty much. We're the Planeteers. Maybe we can use some of your hot air to blow the smog out, Wheeler. No, thanks, Linka. That's your specialty. Wind! Look! She blew the smog cloud all apart! Wow! You guys are awesome! Can I join up? I know all about hero stuff. Ha ha ha! That's a laugh. You're the one who let that smog stuff inside the bus. I didn't mean to. Poor kid. Those environ-meddlers are always showing up where they're not wanted. Good thing they didn't see me. Now I can rescue my experimental smog blob by reassembling its basic pollutants and taking it to my lab. That's the last time those Planeteers ruin one of my genius ideas. [ Chuckles ] Blightmobile, away! Linka: I still say that smog was not normal. Smog is smog. Just to make sure, I am going to test this sample in the laboratory. Well, I'm getting something to eat 'cause I'm starving. Me, too! Is that your idea of a practical joke, Ma-Ti -- throwing your voice? Not me. Heart! I think we have a stowaway! Jason! What are you doing here? You won't send me home, will you? I want to be a hero just like you guys. That is impossible, Jason. Our work is too dangerous for you. I have to take you home, Jason. Gee whiz. I never get to do anything exciting. Hey, I've got an idea. Since you didn't see too much on the flight in, I'll fly you home by the scenic route. Wow, Wheeler, you're really neat! Now, why can't you look up to me like Jason does? Some of us have more important things on our minds. Dr. Blight: Are all smog systems go, MAL? Ready when you are,  Doctor. Then let's turn my experimental smog blob into a real monster. First we pump in  concentrated exhaust fumes... ...then we add  pure coal smoke. Now some nauseous  nitrogen oxides and some  hideous hydrocarbons. Then add the sunlight factor... now! MAL, sweetums, I think our little baby blob is now a mighty monster! A smog monster! Ha ha ha! Ah! Jason: This has been the most exciting day of my life! Glad you enjoyed it. There's lots to see from way up here. Yeah, like that ugly cloud. It's chasing that airplane. Clouds don't chase airplanes. Then what's it doing? We're not waiting here to find out. If it is chasing that plane, we've got to stop it! Planeteer alert! I wish Linka were here, but our rotor blades should blow it away. All right! We did it! Uh-oh! I think that cloud, or whatever it is, is about to undo us! I can't breathe! The smog is burning my eyes! I can't see! Wheeler, we're gonna crash! [ Coughing ] I've got to pull out of this dive! Good work, Wheeler! Yeah, but now the smog thing is going for our engine! I don't think it likes our solar-powered batteries. It must need exhaust fumes to grow on. Look! It's going after that factory smokestack! Eco-copter to Hope Island. Come in, on the double! This is an eco-emergency! I hear you, Wheeler. What is the problem? Take a look.  I'll get closer. You'll have to see it  to believe it. You're wrong, Wheeler. I saw it, but I still do not believe it. Neither do I. It's four times as big  as when we first saw it, and it feeds  on air pollution. I have never heard of such a deadly smog! Oh, yes, you have. Remember that school bus this morning? This sample of smog I took from it has the thickest concentration of oxides and ozone I have ever seen! This must be Dr. Blight's work! We have to help Wheeler stop it before it is too late! Gi: I hope Wheeler gets out of this okay. We're gonna have to hold off that smog monster till the others get here. Yeah! Let's turn that sky scum into toast! First, we got to get closer. Bogey at 10:00. Dr. Blight: No place is safe from those pesky Planeteers! Well, I'll just have to put up a little roadblock. MAL, sweetie, give us rocket power. Yes, Dr. Blight. I'll give you enough liftoff  to make NASA jealous. We're closing in, kid. This situation calls for a little firepower. But -- Huh? Hey! Watch it, you Sunday driver! You've interfered with me for the last time, you fresh-air freak! Dr. Blight! I should have known that monster was your creation. Thank you. It's nice to know my work is appreciated. Come to mama, Babykins. They're getting away! Hurry up and fire! Ouch! Hey! That's my ring! It's dangerous if you don't know how to use it. Shucks. The bad guys are gone. Don't worry. We'll find them. They left a trail a mile wide. You're right, Wheeler. That jet smoke will lead right to Dr. Blight. You can catch up with us after you drop Jason back at his school. No way. I'm coming, too. I'm Wheeler's right-hand man -- aren't I? I think I'm gonna be left-handed for a while, little buddy. That burn on my right hand really hurts. I can't even wear my ring. Come on, Wheeler. I will get the first-aid kit and bandage your hand. Now I'll be a real smog-buster! I just love a good traffic jam! It really fouls up the air. It's just the thing my smog monster needs to grow big and strong. Bon appétit, smog-ums. Aren't you worried the  Planeteers will spoil his meal? It'll be hours before they figure out we doubled back. Anyway, if they do show up, it'll be too late. My monster will be too strong for them to stop. Aaah! Well, see you, Wheeler. Yeah. Hang tough, buddy. Look! It's him -- the smog monster! He's headed for that power plant! The smoke from the burning coal will triple his size! Listen up, Planeteers! We've been tricked! Return to the city, pronto! I've gotta fly, buddy. See you around. Yeah, right. See you around. What's the matter, Mr. Hero? You lose your wings or your nerve? I'll show them who's a hero. I'll show them. He's too big for us to fight alone! We need Captain Planet. I just have to put on -- My ring! [ Gasps ] It's gone! It looks we fight this one without Cap. Those planet-loving pests keep asking for trouble, so I'm going to give it to them. I'll just put their little flyboy out of commission for a while. Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down! I hope this works for me like it did for you, Kwame! Water! Kwame: The smog is corroding that building. Yikes! I jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire! Have no fear! Super Kid is here! I'll just melt the ice in this freezer car to stop them. My ring! Jason, no! You don't know what you're doing! Fire! Hee hee hee! I couldn't have planned it better myself. They'll never destroy my smog monster now! Oh, no! What have I done? Somebody help! Jason! I've got to help him! Aah! The smog monster just missed them! Yes, but... [ Roars ] ...now it is coming after us! The smog monster's got me! Wheeler! Am I glad to see you. Thank me later. Right now I just need my ring. Sorry, Wheeler. I thought it would make me a real hero. That's okay. I just hope Ma-Ti is tuned in to my thoughts so we can call Cap. Ma-Ti, this is Wheeler. Can you hear me? Linka: What happened to Wheeler? I cannot see a thing. And I cannot feel a thing. The smog monster is too strong. I will try to get us up higher, to fresh air. What was that? We just lost one of our wings! Do not tell me. That is the other wing. It's this acidic smog. It's eating through the metal. We have to get through it before... Ma-Ti, Ma-Ti! This is Wheeler! I'm ready to hook up! We're above the smog monster. Wheeler is ready. We can call Captain Planet. Let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! Go, Planet! We've lost power! Have no fear, Planet's here! Ha ha ha! Need a lift, Planeteers? Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to blow. Wow! Even Super Kid can't do that! I've seen some monstrous smog over our cities, but this is ridiculous! Come on, boy. Here you go. That's a good boy. Now what I need here is an air purifier, and there's nothing better than trees. These trees are gonna wash that smog right out of my air. I hope this idea branches out into every city. If the planet had more trees, we'd have less air pollution. What? "Leafing" so soon? Ha ha ha ha! Come back here! I've got you. Now to pour on the heat and shrink you down to size. Let's just wrap this up and take it home. Just what this town needs -- a statue to remind them to reduce toxic emissions before they create their own smog monster. This was some exciting day, huh, little buddy? Hey, Jason! Come back! Where you going? Now, is that any way for a Planeteer to act? Me? You called me a Planeteer? But I'm no hero. Being a Planeteer isn't always glamorous, Jason. Sometimes it's hard work. Whew! You can say  that again! When you see people polluting our planet, let them know it's time to change. Planeteer alert! Planeteer alert! Every day, do what you can to clean up our planet. Then you can be a hero, too. Planeteers: Go, Planet! Gaia: So many cars. So much pollution. Smog is bad for all living things. But you can help. There are lots of ways to get around that don't pollute. And when you get your own cruiser... Keep it tuned up and your tires properly inflated. Remember, drive safe, drive clean. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
