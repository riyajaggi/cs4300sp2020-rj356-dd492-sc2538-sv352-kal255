 Verminous Skumm, a mutant part-man/part-rat, takes over an abandoned coal factory to create acid rain to terrorize the people of a nearby town. Ma-Ti, after being unable to go through an obstacle course, believes that his small size will only disadvantage his friends so doesn't follow them into the factory. But he must find it in himself to take action somehow when they wind up trapped in a warehouse with chemicals, where they can't summon Captain Planet and might not even be able to get out alive...

 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings  to five special young people -- Kwame from Africa,  with the power of Earth. [ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! [ Bird caws ] [ Birds chirping ] ** Soldier: How does the factory look, Mr. Skumm? Skumm: Deserted as an empty rat nest. Those stinking environmentalists had the place closed down

 because it was polluting too much. Some people just got no appreciation for filth. Surface! Aye-aye, Mr. Skumm. ** Come, my soldiers of slime. We're gonna see to it this factory resumes its dirty work, or my name ain't Verminous Skumm! ** We have the smokestack going, Mr. Skumm, just like you ordered. There's enough high-sulfur coal here to do some real serious polluting. That's my kind of dirty trick. Go ahead. Add that special rainmaking chemical. Yes, Mr. Skumm. When that chemical turns the clouds into rain, the coal smoke will turn the rain into acid. [ Hisses ] Wheeler: Come on, dudes! Last one to finish has to jump in an oil spill. [ Grunts ] These obstacles are not easy for a little guy. [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] This obstacle course is a terrific way to stay in shape. Yes, and it is fun, too. All right! Go for it! Looking good, Linka! Now everyone must climb this wall. Okay. Ready...set... go! Go! We have to make it over the mud trap first. But there is no -- Water! Mud! Whoa! [ Chuckles ] I'm going to win. I don't think so, Gi. Earth! [ Rumbling ] [ Gasps ] Aah! Ugh! Nice catch, Kwame. [ Chuckles ] Tag. You're it. Bet you can't catch me again. Oh, yes, I can. [ Chuckles ] Come back here! You can't get away from me! Oh, yes, I can. [ Both laugh ] Need any help, rooskie-tootskie? Hmm. That will be the day, Yankee pest! Come on, Ma-Ti! Come on, come on! Come on, Ma-Ti! You can do it! [ Grunts ] Whoa! All right, Ma-Ti! Come on, Ma-Ti! You can do it! I wish these obstacles were a little smaller [grunts] or I were a little bigger. Keep going! Climb, Ma-Ti! Climb! [ Grunts ] Just a little further, dude. [ Grunts ] Whoa! [ Both gasp ] [ Gasps ] [ Coughs ] Ech! [ Laughter ] Hey, Ma-Ti, with a cherry and some whipped cream, you'd look just like a hot-fudge sundae. [ Laughter ] How embarrassing. And in front of everybody, too. Look! It's Gaia! There must be an eco-emergency. Right you are,  my Planeteers. To the crystal chamber  at once. Linka: Come on, little friend. Let us help you from your messy predicament. Ma-Ti? Everyone always has to helps me because I am so small. I am nothing but trouble. You would all be better off without me. Wait! Ma-Ti! Wheeler: Hey, what's wrong with him? Ma-Ti must feel like he failed. Maybe we shouldn't have laugh at him. Wheeler: What's the trouble, Gaia, and who's the rat responsible? Gaia: Rat, indeed, Wheeler. This time, the culprit is the most sinister rodent that ever lived -- Verminous Skumm. He's an exterminator's nightmare! Born and raised in toxic waste, Skumm and his rat pack thrive on pollution and have declared war on the environment. They've nested in an abandoned factory and have started burning tons of coal. What's so bad about burning a little coal? Many things. One of the worst is that it creates acid rain. This terrible pollution can lay waste to entire forests. It destroys lakes and rivers, and it makes the water undrinkable. Skumm and his henchmen are creating the deadliest cloud of acid rain the world has ever seen. There's no limit to the horrors that cloud could unleash. It could destroy an entire city. [ People shouting ] We have got to stop those evil rats! Good luck, my Planeteers. The hopes of Earth go with you. Wheeler: Planeteer alert! We're coming up on the abandoned factory. Estimated time of arrival-- two minutes. Ma-Ti:  Everyone always has to helps me  because I am so small. I am nothing but trouble. You would all be better off  without me. ** Come on, little buddy. Time to rock 'n' roll. Ma-Ti: I am not going with you. What? Are you all right? What? Why not? I will just get in your way. I do not have what it takes to be a Planeteer. Come on, Ma-Ti. You don't really mean that. Pick up your ring and -- No, Wheeler! Just go away! Go away! Okay, little buddy, if that's how you feel. Poor Ma-Ti. I had no idea he felt so bad. Perhaps we should stay and try to convince him that we need him. There isn't time, dude. Look! Wheeler's right. It won't be long before that cloud starts pouring acid rain. I have an idea. Listen close. You three distract... Skumm: Pour it on, my putrid pals. We'll give the world a shower it'll never forget -- a shower of pollution! As the old saying goes, "Into every life, a little acid rain must fall." [ Hisses ] [ Rumbling ] Earthquake! Good job, Kwame. That ought to rattle those rodents. [ Gasps ] Foolish intruders! How dare you interrupt my work! We're the Planeteers, you festering fur ball. It's our job to stop your evil work. Indeed. We'll see about that. Use your toxic waste. Show these brats this is not a game. [ All gasp ] Look out! I don't run away from rats. Wheeler, stop! Fire! Thanks for your help, kid. Hurry, Wheeler! Remember the plan! Now waste them! ** Well, we succeeded in getting their attention. Now we must keep them busy so Linka can stop their coal-burning operation. That rooskie babe gets easy all the jobs. Oh, it's barricaded. I will need to use my powers to get inside. Wind! ** Watch out, my friends. Please be careful. All I have got to do now is turn off this conveyer machine. Aha! That must be it! [ Zapping ] We're trapped! Then it's time to stop running. I agree. Let's show these renegade rats what Planeteers can do! Water! Whoa! Fire! Ow! Earth! Aah! Congratulations, dudes. Looks like we got rid of them all. Not quite. [ Gasps ] Rats! More rats! Surrender, Planeteers, or else! [ Rumbling ] [ Gasps ] Skumm: Hold it right there,  my pretty little Planeteer. You look out of sight in my sights. [ Hisses ] Oh, no! That acid rain cloud is getting bigger all the time, and my friends have been captured! I should help them. But what can I do? [ Thunder crashes ] Skumm: Soon my acid rain cloud will begin its rain of terror. What a pity you won't be around to see it, Planeteers. Kwame: You have not won yet. Let us go now, or you will regret it later. I am warning you. [ Laughs ] [ Hisses ] Save your breath, impudent human. Lock them up! [ Lock clicks ] Hey! Open up! We got to stop that cheese brain! We have other problems first, Wheeler. Look! Kwame: This room is full of dangerous chemicals. It was irresponsible for these to have been left behind when the factory was closed. [ Gas hissing, all gasp ] Get back! The fumes are poisonous! We have to find a way out of here fast! No problem. I'll just burn a hole in this wall. [ Gasps ] Wheeler, don't! One spark, and these chemicals would explode like a bomb. Gee, I didn't think of that. I will start an earthquake. That will crack this building open like an egg. No, Kwame. An earthquake would spill these chemicals and poison the ground. My wind power might release toxic fumes into the atmosphere. My water power might contaminate an underground spring. Well, friends, we'd better do something, and fast. With the door closed, it will not be long before this room is filled with deadly gas. Let's call Captain Planet. We can't from in here. And not without Ma-Ti. We have to contact him. Ma-Ti: I cannot see my friends anymore. I wonder what those rotten rats have done with them. I could never get passed those guards. My ring! It's glowing! The Planeteers must be calling me. Heart! I sense fear and panic. My friends are in terrible danger. I don't care how dangerous it is. I must help them! [ Gasps ] ** I sure hope we find some more intruders. Me, too. I could really use the target practice. Huh? [ Zap! Mouse squeaks ] [ Both laugh ] Sorry, cousin. Whew! I made it. I guess being small does has some advantages. Heart! My friends are trapped in that building! [ Grunts ] Locked! There must be another way. Perhaps the Planeteers can tell me. Heart! [ All coughing ] Look! Kwame: It's Ma-Ti! He may be little, but he is big in courage. Planeteers, how do I  get into this building? The roof, Ma-Ti! There's a window in the roof! You must climb to the top  of the building and break it open. Kwame: Hurry, Ma-Ti!  Please hurry! This building is like a mountain. What is I can't climb it? But for my friends, I will try. [ All coughing ] We can't hold out much longer. Come on, Ma-Ti. We know you can do it. Ma-Ti: [ Grunts ] Whaa! I cannot do it! I cannot! I could not climb the wall of our obstacle course on Hope Island. How can I ever climb this huge building? [ Sparkle! ] Gaia! Saw you were in trouble. I am scared, Gaia. I cannot make it. Yes, you can, Ma-Ti. The only thing holding you back  is your fear. Look into your heart, and you will find  all the strength you need. With courage,  you can accomplish anything. The power is yours! I must not give up. My friends are depending on me. [ Grunting ] [ All coughing ] [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] I made it! Gaia was right! This is it, dudes. [ All coughing ] Look! Gi: It's Ma-Ti! This fire house, we can use it as a ladder. [ All cough ] Here, my friends. Climb up this. Last one up's a hoser! Mission accomplished, Mr. Skumm. We've burned all the coal. And all the rainmaking chemicals, too. Excellent. Soon we'll see if those stupid humans have enough sense to come in out of the acid rain! [ Hisses ] Back to the rat-tank! That was a close one. Thank you, Ma-Ti. Yeah. You're one tough hombre. [ Thunder crashes ] That terrible cloud is going to start raining acid at any moment! And look where the wind is blowing it. Gi: Right toward that city. Linka: There is nothing we can do to stop that cloud by ourselves. Then let our powers combine! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Sensors show our cloud is just outside the city, Mr. Skumm. Look! Our super acid rain is starting. Skumm: Watch it annihilate that farm. ** Now, that's entertainment! [ Laughter ] The acid rain cloud is killing that forest. Soon, it will be over that city. Can't let that happen. Guess I'd better make like the wind and blow! About-face! Look! Captain Planet's moving the cloud away from the city. All: Go, Planet! Who is that guy? What's he doing with my killer cloud? Hey, you! Get off of my cloud! This should be far enough. Now for a little basic chemistry. To neutralize acid, add a healthy dose of sodium carbonate. [ Grunts ] This underground mineral deposit ought to provide the basic solution. ** Now, that's how I spell "acid relief". That meddling creep has ruined my acid cloud. There's been a change  in the weather, Skumm. And now I'm gonna rain  on your parade. I'll turn that superhero into superzero. Activate the toxic-waste cannon! Whoa! Hey! Ho ho ho! You'll have to do better than that, rat. Oh! Missed me! [ Chuckles ]  Missed me again. It's time to tie up this loose end. [ Grunts ] [ Stammers ] Aw! Captain Planet bent our blaster! Let's get out of here. Dive! Dive! [ Alarm blares ] The rodents are on the run. Wheeler: Yeah, like rats from a sinking ship. Thanks, Captain Planet. Don't thank me. The real hero is Ma-Ti. With brave Planeteers like you, the Earth will always be safe from harm. Remember, the power is yours! Cap's right. If it weren't for you, little partner, we'd all be goners. [ Chuckles ] Nice to have you back on the team, Ma-Ti. Good one. Outstanding, Ma-Ti. ** [ Grunting ] [ All cheer ] The feeling that one person  can't make a difference is the greatest obstacle  of all. Congratulations, Ma-Ti.  You overcame your fears. You're a true Planeteer. All: Go, Planet! What's the problem, Planeteers? It's acid rain, Cap. Those factories burning coal and polluting the air are a real menace. Ma-Ti: When the air pollution mixes with the clouds and then rains, it can destroy forests. Gi: As well as pollute the drinking water and kill fish and other wildlife. Write a letter to your congressperson to support our environmental laws. The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
