[DOLPHIN SQUEALING] OH, NO! THE POOR DOLPHIN! WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS NOW! WHEELER! LINKA! WHERE IS EVERYBODY? EARTH. WHERE IS EVERYBODY? OOH! HOGGISH GREEDLY IS WIPING OUT OUR SEA FRIENDS WITH HIS DRIFT NETS. SLOW DOWN. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? KWAME, HE'S TURNING THE OCEAN INTO A DEAD SEA. WAIT A SECOND, GI! I KNOW YOU LOVE OUR SEA FRIENDS, BUT AT LEAST TALK TO GAIA. GAIA WOULD SEND US TO STOP GREEDLY. IF YOU WON'T COME, I'LL GO ALONE. [BEEPING] I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA, BUT YOU CAN'T GO ALONE. HE'S GOT THOUSANDS OF MILES OF THOSE NETS. ONCE GREEDLY'S FINISHED, NOTHING WILL BE LEFT. IT IS SENSELESS. IF PEOPLE FISHED THE RIGHT WAY, THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE ENOUGH. OH, LOOK! A HUMPBACK WHALE! THE DRIFT NETS ARE ALMOST INVISIBLE. POOR THINGS DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. SUCH A CRUEL WASTE. GET READY. WE'RE GOING UP. [MOANING] YOU FREE THE DOLPHIN. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE SHIP. CALM DOWN, MY FRIEND.

WE CAUGHT THEM! WE DID! WE DID! WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS WRONG, GREEDLY. WE'LL STOP IT. NO CHANCE, NATURE NERDS. I'M KEEPING YOU ON ICE WHILE I GO FISHING. I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO YOU, KWAME. WE MUST CONCENTRATE SO THAT MA-TI WILL PICK UP OUR SIGNAL. LET'S DO IT. YOU DON'T GET IT. I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY. YOU THINK NEW YORK IS BETTER THAN MOSCOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE VIDEO HALLWAYS. VIDEO ARCADES. HA HA HA-- SOMETHING IS WRONG. YOU SAID IT. LINKA'S GOT IT ALL WRONG. NO. IT'S KWAME AND GI. HEART! THEY ARE TRAPPED ON HOGGISH GREEDLY'S FISHING SHIP. WHAT? A FISHING SHIP? LINKA, TURN AROUND! LET'S BOOK! I'LL SEND THEM A THOUGHT MESSAGE. IT'S FASTER. KWAME, GI,  WE NEED CAPTAIN PLANET. MA-TI HEARD US. LET'S GO TOPSIDE TO JOIN OUR POWERS WITH THE OTHERS'. LET OUR POWERS COMBINE. HMM? WHAT ARE THOSE BRATS UP TO? EARTH! HUH? FIRE! WIND! WATER! HEART! BY YOUR POWERS COMBINED, I AM CAPTAIN PLANET! GO, PLANET! THE RINGS. SO THAT'S HOW THOSE ECO-SISSIES GET CAPTAIN PLANET TO COME TO THEIR RESCUE. ALL I HAVE TO DO TO STOP CAPTAIN PLANET IS GET THOSE RINGS! UH-OH! THANKS, CAPTAIN PLANET. NO PROBLEM-O.
