 [ Laughs ] Yeah, boss. Yeah! Even in the wildlife sanctuary. Right! And before anybody even knows we're here, we'll have our tanks full of oil and be gone! [ Laughs, snorts ] I'll be so rich, I'll be in hog heaven! [ Laughs, snorts ] ** Oh. [ Yawns ] [ Gasps ] My goodness! Can't the spirit of Earth take a little nap? [ Rumbling ] [ Gasps ] What's going on? Oh, it's those poor, silly humans again. They're gonna destroy my planet if they keep going on like this. What's a mother to do? Oh, I guess I napped too long. But how much damage could they do in a century? [ Seagulls crying ] [ Bird caws ] [ Gasps ] It's worse than I thought! Earth is dying. The time has come for the rings. I need young people to help now, starting with five very special kids from five corners of the globe. From Africa -- Kwame. ** From Asia -- Gi. [ Dolphin calls ] [ Grunts ] [ Dolphin calls ] From North America... [ Grunting ] [ Laughs ] [ Whimpers ] Ow! ...Wheeler. [ Footsteps depart ] [ Laughs ] [ Gasps ] ** From the Soviet Union... [ Keyboard plays ] [ Bird chirps ] ...Linka. ** And from South America... [ Monkey screeching ] [ Leopard growls ] [ Screeching continues ] ...Ma-Ti. [ Monkey chittering ] [ Leopard growls ] [ Chittering continues ] These, then, are my first Planeteers... the world's greatest hope. Welcome to Hope Island. [ New York accent ] Yo! Say, lady, you want to explain what's going on here? [ Chuckles ] So much for drama. All right, let me get this straight. Your name is Gaia, and you're the spirit of the Earth? And you brought us here to help you save Earth from being ruined? Yes, that's about the size of it. [ Russian accent ] Saving our planet is, yes, a good thing. However, we're but youths. How can we help? Hey, love your accent, babe. You Russian? Soviet. Please, go away. Love it. [ Clears throat ] As I was saying, through your power rings, each of you can control one power of nature, to a limited degree. For instance, you, Linka, control the power of wind. Try it. Well, all right. Wind! [ All gasp ] Whoa! [ Wind whistling ] Aah! No! Stop! Ugh!  Chort vozmi! Gaia: [ Chuckles ] Kwame, your power is Earth. Go ahead. Try it. All right. Earth! [ Rumbling ] Impressive! Truly, with a ring such as this, I will be able to plant many trees and also stop many bulldozers from destroying the forest. Now you're getting the idea. What's my element? Water? Fire? Yeow! Uh, sorry. You got an extinguisher? Better than that. Gi, your power is water. Okay. Here it goes. Water! [ All scream ] [ Monkey screeching ] Huh! Nice job, toots. I'm all wet. You certainly are! At least the fire is out. Oh, yeah. [ Monkey chittering ] What do you think your power is, Ma-Ti? I already know. Mine is heart. I can sense you all -- hear your thoughts,  feel your feelings. Bozhe moi! I can hear him in my head! That's right. Ma-Ti, yours is the greatest power of all. Because without a heart to guide them, the other powers are useless. Through you, the others will always be linked, no matter where they are. On the side of good, you are a team, now and forever the Planeteers. [ All cheer ] Yeah! This is going to be hot! Aah! [ Chuckles ] But first, I see we will need to practice with our new powers. There's no time, Kwame, for we already face our first crisis. [ Walrus barks ] The planet is being threatened by the evil Hoggish Greedly and his sidekick, Rigger. [ Laughs maniacally, snorts ] ** Whoopee! You were right! This wildlife preserve is rich in high-grade crude! [ Laughs ] Yip! Yip! Uh, the only thing is, ain't that oil leaking up going to hurt all the animals on the coast? Huh? Huh? Aah! Who cares? There's only one thing in the world worth caring about, and that's me! Wheeler: Hey, how come you get to fly this thing? You have a driver's license? Well, no. [ Chuckles ] That's why. [ Laughter ] You know, this has been a very weird day. One minute, I'm a kid from Brooklyn, the next minute, I'm some sort of cut-rate superhero flying off to battle some pig-face polluter. Oh, if only Gaia could be with us. She is, Linka. Watch. Heart! Don't worry, Planeteers. Though I need to stay  at Hope Island, I will be with you in spirit. A lot of good that will do us in a fire fight. Wheeler, don't say "fire" until you mean it. Water! You must have faith in  yourselves, Planeteers, because you're fighting for  the good of the whole world. And if we encounter a situation which we cannot handle? Well, just put  your powers together. Then you'll really  be surprised. Wait a minute! What's that supposed to mean? Sit down, Yankee. And fasten the seat belt for your safety. Didn't know you cared. [ Sighs ] It is horrible. The whole coastline is being destroyed! Ma-Ti: Those poor animals. We must help them. Kwame: We will. But first, we have to stop the oil spill. Land on that derrick. Right. Mr. Greedly, look! Is it the Coast Guard? No. No. I think we're in deeper slop than that. [ Chuckles, snorts ] But no big deal. [ Laughs, snorts ] Hoggish Greedly will be too slick for 'em! Ha! I'll spray them with oil! Gi: We're being hit! Wheeler: Man, these guys are really rude with crude! [ Grunts ] The controls are jammed! We're going down! Aah! Aah! [ Laughs maniacally ] Oh, that will teach them to interfere with the polluted plans of Hoggish Greedly! Gi: We're going to crash! No, we are not. Linka, your wind power. But of course. Wheeler, take out door. You got it, rooskie tootskie. Fire! Now...wind! You did it! We'll land safely now. No! Cannot get us to land. We'll still hit water and sink! No, we won't. Leave it to me. Earth! Yeah! Did it! All: Go, Planeteers! Did you see that? Huh? Huh? It's impossible. [ Snorts ] They could still fry our chops, but they're just kids. I can handle them. [ Echoing ] Greetings,  strange ship. Who are you,  anyway? [ Echoing ]  We're the Planeteers, you  greedy pollution-causing creep. And as soon as  we get out boat set up, we're gonna sail over there  and kick your curly pig tail. Don't bother shooting  more crude, dude, 'cause I'll personally vaporize  every drop before it hits us. [ Snorts ] Oh, I'm sure you could, Planeteer, so I won't bother shooting at you. But I warn you,  mind your own business, or my next blast of crude will land on your furry friends  onshore. I think we got problems. What are we going to do? Well, we must do something. That derrick is still spilling oil. Every second we delay, more of the shore becomes polluted. The animals are threatened. But if we attack the derrick, Greedly will bury them in pollution. We situation is more than we can handle, Planeteers. We need help. You mean... Exactly. We must do as Gaia advised -- we must combine our powers. Let's do it! Let our powers combine. Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain planet! All: Go, Planet! Holy smoke! What the heck is that? Huh? Huh? [ Snorts ] Trouble. Get on deck and man the arms. We're getting out of here. ** Wheeler: Greedly is getting away! And he's letting all the oil spill into the ocean! What do you want us to do, Captain Planet? Your rings are temporarily useless while I'm here, but I am your powers combined and magnified. For now, I'll handle Greedly and the spill. You can help those animals. Right. All: Go, Planet! Now, the first order of business is to put all this oil back where it came from. ** Wheeler: Captain Planet's doing it! He's sucking the oil back. Go, Planet! There. Now to seal it off. [ Grunts ] That should hold it. Now for Greedly! Oops! Almost forgot. [ Grunts ] Mustn't litter. Impossible! He cleaned up the entire oil slick! Greedly: [ Snorts ] We can fight better on land. Here he comes, boss. Yeow! [ Metal squeaks ] ** [ Laughing ] Come on, you guys. That tickles. The drill don't even scratch him. Aah! [ Chuckles ] But enough fun. There's trash to take out. [ Grunts ] And I know just the place for garbage like you. Aah! [ Screaming ] Hey! Hey, let me out! Let me out! Hey! Now for you, Greedly. [ Snorts ] I don't think so, hero. If I can't drill you, I'll waste you... with some toxic waste! Aah! Oh! Oh! Aah! Ooh! Captain Planet! Come on! Captain Planet's in trouble! Captain Planet, what's wrong? [ Straining ] Oh, the toxic waste -- draining my strength. We must do something to help him. [ Grunts ] Look, the globe on his chest, it's glowing. Quickly! Bring some water! Water? No problem. Oops, I forgot. I don't have my power. Then we must improvise. [ Laughs ] [ Steam hisses ] Look out! Greedly's starting to turn that machine around. Kwame: And it's coming right towards us! Quick! Roll that rock over here to protect Captain Planet! [ All grunting ] ** Gi: We've got the water. It's working! Wheeler: The sun's charging him back up! [ Straining ] By your powers combined... ** ...I feel like a brand-new hero. You are! Yeah. And you're brand-new heroes, too, Planeteers. Thanks for your help. Now, if you'll excuse me... Ha ha! No one defeats Greedly! [ Snorts ] No one! Huh? [ Grunts ] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! ** All: All right! Go, Planet! Greedly, where are you? Hmm. He's gone. No one gets in the way of Hoggish Greedly. [ Snorts ] I will be back, Captain Planet. It is good that Greedly was stopped. Yeah, but I've got a feeling you'll see him again. And when you do, call me. We will. All right! What now, Captain Planet? My work here is done, but yours is just beginning, Planeteers. And remember... the power is yours! Fire. Good thing we have our powers back now. We need them to clean up all this mess. Water. [ Bird squawks ] Yeah. But it doesn't seem fair. We didn't make the mess, so why do we have to clean it up? We're not getting paid any money. Earth. Wind. Because we care, my sweet, imperialist dog. Besides, some rewards are greater than money. [ Birds chirping ] Right? Yeah, I guess. Whoa! Come on. Hey, that tickles. [ Laughter ] [ Horns honking ] I want you to join me and the Planeteers in saving our planet. All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: You can fight oil spills and air pollution by encouraging your family not to waste gasoline and other fuels. Turn off your lights in your house when you don't need them. If you can carpool, do it. Better yet, if you're only going a short distance, walk or ride a bike. It's healthier for you and our planet. So, don't be a Greedly. The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
