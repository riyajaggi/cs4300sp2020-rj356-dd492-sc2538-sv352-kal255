 Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand  the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings  to five special young people -- Kwame from Africa,  with the power of Earth. [ Sirens wailing ] From North America -- Wheeler,  with the power of fire. ** From the Soviet Union -- Linka,  with the power of wind. From Asia -- Gi,  with the power of water.

 ** And from South America --  Ma-Ti, with the power of heart. When the five powers combine, they summon  Earth's greatest champion -- Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Captain Planet: The power is yours! Duke Nukem: At last! After six months of night, the radiant sun returns to the South Pole and Duke Nukem! Ahh! Sure is pretty, Mr. Nukem. Pretty? I hate pretty! All I care about is my plan to turn the world into a radiation wasteland!

 And these two factories I stole will help me to reach that goal! [ Machinery powers on ] ** [ Steam hissing ] You're going to destroy the world with [chuckles] air-conditioners? Quiet, leadhead. I'm not interested in air-conditioners or refrigerators. I want the chlorofluorocarbons they give off. And the changes I made in this factory will help me get them! Chlorofluba? Chlorofloor? CFCs to you, leadhead. What are you gonna do with CFCs? The sun sends delicious ultraviolet radiation, but that killjoy ozone layer blocks out the deadly rays. Now for the good part. CFCs eat a hole in the ozone layer of Earth's atmosphere. But without the ozone, the sun's deadly ultraviolet radiation will pour down on us. Exactly. That's why I built my giant lens -- to magnify and focus those ultraviolet rays. You needn't worry. Your lead suit will keep you from being fried, while I feed on the radiation. Ah! Here it comes now! I feel stronger already. Beware, world, Duke Nukem is sizzling. [ Sighs ] [ Speaks Russian ] This day is a real torcher. I think you mean a scorcher. [ Monkey chitters ] Well, Ma-Ti and I didn't waste our trip to the city. This will keep one of our huts real cool. An air-conditioner! Good thinking, Wheeler! Ahh. Cool as a Siberian breeze. Ma-Ti: Ahh. This is what I call civilized, and I never would have had it without my wise friend Wheeler. Gaia: To the crystal chamber,  Planeteers. Duty calls [sighs] just when we're getting cool. Linka: Gaia, the ozone hole over the South Pole, it is bigger than ever! Dangerous radiation is pouring in! Yes, Linka. And this time, it's deliberate. Someone is making vast amounts of CFCs. Who could do such a horrible thing? Who's the only human, if you can call him human, who actually thrives on radiation? Dr. Duke Nukem. His hunger for radiation could destroy our world. Yes, Kwame. If we lose our ozone shield, ultraviolet rays will give our whole planet a case of severe sunburn. People's skin and eyes will be damaged. Plants will die. Our planet will become a desert. Sunlight will become our enemy. We'll be driven indoors, our food supply will be destroyed. Then we must shut down Duke Nukem's operation. Next stop, South Pole! Remember, Duke Nukem can zap us with every type of harmful radiation you can think of. He must not see us coming. Wheeler: Let her rip! [ Beeping, whirring ] This is great! Yeah, but does anyone here know how to operate this puppy? I have piloted an iceboat before during winter vacation in Siberia. Sounds like fun. But to start, we need a boost. Wind! Are you sure you know what you are doing? I look radiant. And what a lovely day for soaking up some U.V. rays. Hey, leadhead. Uh, that's Lead Suit, sir. Whatever. I need more CFC gas. Increase the factory's output! That's more like it. Huh? Intruders! I hate uninvited company. Planeteer alert! Look! It's Duke Nukem's... factories? Excellent. A chance to test my radiation powers. Now, what kind shall I use? X-rays? U.V.? No. I'll give them a warm welcome... with infrared radiation. [ Rumbling ] Avalanche! Linka, get us out of here! That thought occurs to me. Hmm. That took a lot out of me. Fortunately, there's more radiation where that came from! Kwame: Can we sneak in on foot? Da. I know how to travel in Siberian blizzard conditions. Maybe we'd better follow Linka. Hey, we have snow in Brooklyn, too, you know? Come on, Ma-Ti, we'll take out the other factory. Uh, I'm not sure. Wheeler, don't be such a know-it-all. You will get lost. No way! We'll find our factory first and shut it down. Now, we must take a bearing on landmark so we do not get lost. [ Wind howling ] Brr! If this is daytime in Antarctica, I hope I am not here when night comes. This is no time for cold feet. The factory should be right ahead of us. You're right! There it is! Wheeler, do you think we are near the factory yet? Look! What did I tell you Ma-Ti? I bet we beat Linka. Huh? Wheeler: Oh, no. We're back where we started. [ Sighs ] Well, at least we beat them back to the iceboat. Come on, Ma-Ti. I know where we made the wrong turn. Gi: He's big! How do we get past him? I think I can keep him busy. Earth! What's that? Uh-oh! Now... it's quitting time! Water! [ Electricity crackling ] [ Machinery powers down ] ** I'm losing that special glow, Lead Suit. Thank you for calling me Lead Suit, sir. You have no idea what that means to me. Oh, no! You let those vile brats get into my refrigerator factory. I was right the first time! You are a leadhead! Hey! You kids think you're so good, let's see if you can walk on water. Time to put you meddlers on ice. That freezing polar wind should do it. The water's turning to ice! I cannot get loose! Gi, can you use your ring to command the ice? It is only frozen water. Where is my ring? It fell off! It's frozen in the ice! Now, if there are no further interruptions, I'd like to finish my sunbathing. Linka, do you have any sunblock? How can you worry about that when our legs are freezing? Because soon your face will be burning. We're too close to that ultraviolet radiation. If we don't get out of here quick, we'll get the most dangerous sunburn anyone ever got. [ Laughs maniacally ] Soon I'll be at full power. I'm just a wild and radioactive guy. Mmm-mmm. Melted marshmallow. Yuck! This suit has a lot of drawbacks. [ Laughs ] Well, at least someone is in a good mood. I would not like to see him in a bad mood. We all must get away from this radiation. Linka, you are getting a serious sunburn. Forget me. Look at poor Gi. What's keeping Wheeler and Ma-Ti? Wheeler, we are lost. No, we're not. I've been through worse blizzards in Brooklyn. Really? What did you do? Well, actually, I took the subway. Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Ow! Oh! That's not the kind of subway I meant. Wheeler, look! We made it! What's Duke Nukem making? Air-conditioners just like ours. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah. We would have gotten ours a lot cheaper here. No! Duke Nukem stole this air-conditioner factory. I wonder why. I don't know why. And I don't care. Let's just shut down those CFCs. Wheeler, wait! Ah, my favorite kind of "radio activity." Look, our friends are trapped! We must free them! Wait! If that radioactive reptile sees us, we're toast. You are right. But I have an idea how to rescue them without being seen. Okay. Meanwhile, I'll try to cut the power. Heart! [ Penguins chittering ] My penguin friends,  please help us. Some power cables. Now, if I follow them, it should lead me straight to the main power switch. Help is on the way. Good! I'm pulling the plug on this place. Fire! [ Machinery powers down ] What's that? Sounds like help has arrived. [ Penguins chittering ] [ Gasps ] Look! Penguins! [ Chuckles ] Look what the penguins are doing. I'll bet Ma-Ti's behind this. Lead Suit, what are those mangy birds doing over there? Actually, sir, they aren't mangy at all. They look very well-dressed. Spare me the fashion review. What?! My air-conditioner factory has stopped, too! Start it up again. I need more CFCs to widen the ozone hole! Oh, no! What are we going to do now? [ Chitters ] Hey! Suchi's got the right idea. Duke Nukem can't get the factory started without the main switch. [ Chitters ] Huh? I could have sworn there was a switch here. That's odd. I told you to get that factory going, lunkhead. Lead Suit, sir. But I can't. Someone stole the switch! Stole the switch? Those Planeteers again! My foot's free! Mine, too! Gi: All right! My ring! Thank you! Thank you, my friends. Now you must go Not exactly the Marines, but they got the job done. [ Gasps ] Kwame: Back to the iceboat, everyone! Stop! Bring back my switch! Sir, I wouldn't blame you if you were critical of me. You incompetent! You're not only a leadhead, you're a lead-footed, lead-faced, lead-brained -- Remember your radiation level, sir. You're reaching critical mass. You'll have a meltdown! I'll melt you down! But first, we'll fix those putrid Planeteers. Come on! Get on the nuke-sled, leadhead. That's Lead Suit, sir. I got the juice! I am the power! Now, let's get the Planeteers! [ Laughs evilly ] Kwame: Look out! Here comes Duke Nukem! Oh! Wheeler, I have an idea of how to stop him. No, not so fast, sir. We'll throw a control rod. Bolt your mouth shut, leadlips. I need that switch! Gi: Fire when ready, Wheeler. Fire! Water! That should send him head over heels. Oh, no! Oh, get a grip, Lead Suit. You really get me steamed. [ Gasps ] Hurry, Linka! Chert voz'mi! He is faster than us, but we can be smarter! What? Whoa! Get off me! Linka: Hold on! Aargh! Oof! Oh! Aah! Oof! Aah! Oh! I don't feel well, sir. Could we stop for a second? Of course you can. Thank you, sir. I'll nuke that boat and make them all [chuckles] fallout! [ Planeteers scream ] [ Coughs ] I c-c-cannot believe it was just this morning we were worried about keeping c-cool. Give it up, Planeteers. I want my power switch now. Well, well, look-a here. My power switch! Ok, Planeteers, prepare to sizzle. Wha! Duke Nukem is running out of radiation. Now we can call Captain Planet. Uh-oh! I've seen this before. Let our powers combine. Earth! What a time to run out of power! Fire! I need more radiation! Wind! Here I am, Mr. Nukem. Water! For a guy with all that heat, he can sure be cold. Heart! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! All: Go, Planet! Gaia:  Be careful, Captain planet. Duke Nukem is contaminated  with radiation again. Ahh! I really get a charge out of this. Wait. Maybe I'm not too late. There is one way I can get near him. Hmm. This lead wardrobe sure gets stuffy. If I didn't have a radioactive boss, I'd toss it. Huh? I don't think much of your tailor, but I'd love to try on your suit. Uh, sure. Take it. And don't worry about having it cleaned when you're done. Just a lead suit. Nukem: [ Laughs ] Now let Captain Planet come near me. I'll shorten his half-life down to nothing. [ Laughs ] Huh? Well, it's high time you got back here, leadhead. Don't give me the silent treatment. Just remember that lead suit won't keep this out! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Did I say "leadhead"? I meant Lead Suit. Whoa! Ooh! [ Groans ] Uh, have you been working out? Captain Planet: You might say that. Huh? Captain Planet? I'm going to irradiate you! Radioactivity won't penetrate this suit, Nukem. I've got all kinds of radiation! Try some infrared heat! [ Radiation sizzles ] Aw, burnt out already? Watch this, Planet. I can always get more energy! [ Grunting ] Yes! [ Laughs ] Huh? [ Grunts ] No! Aah! I'm sorry to shatter your dreams. But I've had enough of your ultraviolet ultraviolence. Oh, my suit's all stretched out. My U.V. radiation, it's gone. I'm done for. Hey, leadhead! Let's roll! But my suit... Never mind. Get us out of here, and I'll never call you leadhead again. You have a deal, sir. Now, move it, chrome dome! I think I preferred leadhead. Thank you for helping us stop Duke Nukem, Captain Planet. Too bad you could not close up the ozone hole, as well. No. That's too much for me alone. But you took the first step by stopping Duke Nukem's CFC scam. Good job, Planeteers. The power is yours! Whew! It has not cooled off any on Hope Island. I can't wait to get into that air-conditioned hut. Hey, Ma-Ti, what gives? Sorry, Wheeler. But this air-conditioner runs on CFCs. We must take it back. No. It's not fair. I'll miss it, too. But it is a small sacrifice to make if it will help save our planet. I see your point. We'll wait until we can buy one that doesn't use CFCs. Whoa! Good one! [ Laughs ] Fortunately, we don't need CFCs to cool off. I wouldn't spray that at me. Oh? Why? Water! Whoa! [ Laughter ] ** All: Go, Planet! I see you're catching some R&R.; No, Cap. We're catching rays. We are sitting in the shade, Wheeler. You are getting burned. Linka's right. The sun's rays are very powerful and can burn your skin. And damage to the ozone layer, which protects our Earth, makes the problem even worse. Don't get burned. Protect your skin from the sun with clothing or sunblock. Too much sun is no fun. The power is yours! Earth! Fire! Wind! Water! Heart! All: Go, Planet! By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet! * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * He's our powers magnified * And he's fighting on the planet's side * * Captain Planet * He's our hero * Gonna take pollution down to zero * * Gonna help him put asunder * Bad guys who like to loot and plunder * You'll pay for this, Captain Planet! * We're the Planeteers, you can be one, too * * 'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do * * Looting and polluting is not the way * * Hear what Captain Planet has to say * The power is yours! **
