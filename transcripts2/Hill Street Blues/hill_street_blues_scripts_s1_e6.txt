JOHN, FRANK FURILLO. YEAH, WE TRACED THE GUN TO A RITA PEREZ. WE'RE HOLDING HER AND HER HUSBAND. UH, YEAH, HE'S A PETTY THIEF. THREE PRIORS. LISTEN, JOHN, WHAT I'D LIKE TO GET FROM YOU IS A REJECT OF THIS GUY... ON THAT CHARGE OF RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY, IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS COOPERATION. NO, TWO REASONS. THE DESCRIPTION DOESN'T MATCH, AND HE WAS IN COUNTY JAIL WHEN IT HAPPENED. SURE HE'LL HAVE REPRESENTATION. IN FACT, PUBLIC DEFENDER JOYCE DAVENPORT IS SITTING IN MY OFFICE THIS VERY MOMENT. RIGHT. THANK YOU, JOHN. AMONG OTHER THINGS, DISTRICT ATTORNEY SIMONSON ALLOWS... AS HOW HE'D ABANDON HIS WIFE OF 19 YEARS... JUST FOR A MEANINGFUL WEEKEND WITH YOU. TELL HIM TO TAKE A NUMBER. LOOK, FURILLO, I CAME HERE TO SEE A SPECIFIC CLIENT. AND IN CASE YOU'RE NOT CLUED IN YET AS TO THE PROCESS, I DON'T TAKE MY ASSIGNMENTS FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, NOR THE EASTER BUNNY AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM YOU. WE'VE GOT A LEAD ON THE HILL-RENKO SHOOTING. A GOOD ONE, THAT MIGHT NOT WAIT ON THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. YOU'RE ON DANGEROUS GROUND, FURILLO. ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU COULD SAVE US A LOT OF TIME. HOW SO? I THINK I CAN PERSUADE THE D.A. TO REJECT THESE CHARGES AGAINST YOU, MR. PEREZ, IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR COOPERATION. AS YOUR ATTORNEY OF RECORD, I FEEL I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T, UH, READ YOU THE FACTS OF LIFE. NOW, IF I WERE THE D.A., MR. PEREZ, LOOKING FOR AN EASY WAY, AND I'D SAY YOU'RE IT. A THREE-TIME LOSER FACING GRAND THEFT, ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF A FIREARM, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE IF THE CAPTAIN HERE DECIDES TO SEARCH YOUR RESIDENCE. SO, YOU'VE GOT TWO CHOICES. YOU CAN LET ME TRY FOR A REJECTION OF CHARGES, IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR TELLING THE POLICE WHERE YOU GOT THE .357, OR YOU CAN PLAY MACHO MAN AND GET THE BOOK JAMMED UP YOUR NOSE. I'D LIKE TO GET A PIECE OF HIM, FRANK. OKAY, COME ON, YOU TWO. WE'RE THROUGH IN HERE. LET'S GO. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. WAIT A MINUTE, CAPTAIN. CHICO, NO. MISS DAVENPORT?
