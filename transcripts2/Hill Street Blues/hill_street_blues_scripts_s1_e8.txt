 THANK YOU, SERGEANT. CAMP GUADALCANAL, GENTLEMEN. WHERE THE GHETTO STREETS END AND MANHOOD BEGINS. WHERE DEMOCRACY PLAYS ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE DOMINO THEORY, AND PROTECTIVE REACTION IS NOT JUST A FOURTH-DOWN CALL. - HIKE! NOW, AS SOME OF US ALREADY KNOW, CAMP GUADALCANAL IS RUN BY THIS DEPARTMENT... IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCAL ARMY SPECIAL FORCES VOLUNTEERS. WHERE, AND FOR HOW LONG? FOR THREE ELECTRIFYING SUMMERS... IN THE WILD INTERIORS OF ALLEGHENY STATE PARK. I'M NOT GONNA WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME... AND MINE... BY GOING INTO THE SHORT STROKES, BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, OUR REGIMEN, AS ALWAYS, IS THE SAME HECK OF A TURN-ON. FOUR INTENSIVE WEEKS OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING, INCLUDING FIELD MANEUVERS, FULL-EQUIPMENT 10K, HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT... ALONG WITH OUR TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM DISCIPLINES OF THIRD-WORLD TOPOGRAPHIES, ELEMENTARY INFILTRATION, AND A TEEN GUIDE TO ROMMEL. DISPATCH. WE HAVE A 9-11. ARMED ROBBERY IN PROGRESS.

I'M TRYING TO WRITE A LETTER TO CHIEF DANIELS. THE MAN IS CERTIFIABLE, ALF. HE BELONGS IN THE V.A. HOSPITAL, UNDER MAXIMUM SEDATION. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, HENRY. I'D COOL OFF BEFORE I DID ANYTHING I'D REGRET. I DON'T CARE. DO NOT THINK THAT THE MAN IS NOT DANGEROUS, ALF, BECAUSE HE IS. THOSE ARE KIDS HE'S TRYING TO MAKE INTO MILITARY GANGSTERS. ALF, HENRY. WHAT'S THE TROUBLE? FOR OPENERS, MY DRY CLEANERS BURNED DOWN LAST NIGHT. FOUR SUITS GONE. UP IN SMOKE. NOT THE BROWN MODIFIED TWEED WITH THE LITTLE BLUE SPECKS? THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR WARDROBE, FRANCIS. FRANK, I'M A 39 REGULAR, IN CASE YOU NEED SOMETHING TO HOLD YOU OVER. I'M A 46 REGULAR, FRANK, DEPENDING ON THE CUT. HEY, IT'S OKAY. THANKS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WORRY ABOUT THIS. "LING LING GIVES BIRTH TO PANDA TWINS?" NO, NO, PHIL. THAT ONE. "MERCHANTS FORM URBAN COALITION. DEKKER AVENUE MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION VOWS TO FIGHT CRIME"? SOUNDS WELL-INTENTIONED, FRANCIS. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD AN ASSOCIATION. NEITHER DID THEY, UNTIL THAT NEWS TEAM SHOWED UP. SHE WAS DOWN THERE COVERING THAT SUPERMARKET STICK-UP. REMEMBER? SWANSON CALLED THIS MORNING. SEEMS OUR MS. CHASE... DID A VIGILANTE STORY ON THE 6:00 NEWS. LIFE FOLLOWS VIDEO. LISTEN, SHE'S GONNA BE AROUND HERE... QUITE A LOT THE REST OF THIS WEEK, FINISHING UP THAT PRECINCT DOCUMENTARY OF HERS. SO LET'S TRY TO MONITOR HER ACTIVITIES. OKAY? AW, GEE, FRANK, I'D HATE TO HAVE US ACCUSED OF MANAGING THE MEDIA. WHAT I GUESS I MEAN IS, UH... YOU'D JUST LIKE US TO PROVIDE HER WITH A LITTLE GUIDANCE. WELL PUT, HENRY. LISTEN, EDDIE HOBAN SITS FOR THAT LIE DETECTOR TEST THIS MORNING AT 10:00, I THINK. SO LET'S START CALLING DOWN THERE FOR THE RESULTS AROUND 11:30, OKAY? RIGHT, FRANCIS. YOU WANT THIS? NO, YOU BE AGGRAVATED FOR A WHILE. SARGE, I GOT A COUPLE OF MESSAGES FOR YA. THIS GUY, I DON'T KNOW. HE WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU'D GOTTEN HIS CARD YET. HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE A NUMBER, AND HIS NAME IS KERMIT TRENCH. THAT IS A "K" ON THERE. KERMIT TRENCH. KERMIT TRENCH? IS HE OUT? HEY! EVERYBODY SHUT UP AND STAND STILL. I SAID SHUT UP! MR. VIATORO, WHAT'S GOING ON? WE WANT THIS PUNK ARRESTED. MR. ARCANIAN HERE CAUGHT HIM RIPPING OFF A FIFTH OF TEQUILA FROM HIS LIQUOR DEPARTMENT. NOT THE FIRST TIME, EITHER, THE LITTLE PUNK'S HIT ME. EPSTEIN, MRS. MILES, TELL HIM ABOUT YOUR CASH REGISTER, WHAT HE DID. GRABBED THE KEY FROM ME AND OPENED THE DRAWER. TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME! I DIDN'T DO NOTHING! ALL RIGHT. EASY, EASY! SETTLE DOWN, SETTLE DOWN! HOLD IT. PUT THE KID IN HOLDING. MR. VIATORO, SINCE YOU SEEM... HOLD IT. TURN OFF THE CAMERA. TURN IT OFF, AND TAKE A SEAT IN MY OFFICE. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. PLEASE, MS. CHASE. LET'S GO. COME ON. DON'T WANT HER TO FILM IT? IN THE OFFICE. YOU PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS HUSHING IT UP. SINCE YOU SEEM TO BE IN CHARGE HERE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON... WHY I SHOULDN'T ARREST EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU? - TALK TO ME. - OKAY, THIS IS NOTHING PERSONAL HERE, OKAY? I MEAN, WE KNOW HOW HARD IT IS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, YOU GUYS CAN'T PROTECT US. OKAY? - THAT'S RIGHT. - WE CAN'T GO ON THE WAY WE ARE. SO WE FORMED THIS ASSOCIATION. THIS IS ONLY A PART OF US. THE DEKKER AVENUE MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION. PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION. WE'RE NOT LEAVING THIS BUILDING TILL THAT KID... GETS BOOKED, AND WE GET SANCTIONED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY, THAT'S CLEAR, AND I HEAR YOU. UH, PHIL, WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW MR. VIATORO AND HIS GROUP... INTO THE ROLL CALL ROOM, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOVE ALONG DOWNSTAIRS, FOLKS. WE CAN INTERFACE MORE COMFORTABLY DOWN THERE. EVERYTHING WILL BE SPOKEN ABOUT AND TAKEN CARE OF. ALL RIGHT. COME ON. CAPTAIN, WE'RE NOT JUST MAKING NOISE HERE. KNOW THAT. RAY, WOULD YOU GET ME DIVISION? OKAY. I FIGURE THEY'LL START HOBAN OFF WITH EASY QUESTIONS LIKE... WHAT'S THE CAPITAL OF FRANCE? HOW MANY GRAMS IN AN OUNCE OF SMACK? BUT WHEN THEY START TALKING ABOUT THAT SHOOTING, THAT NEEDLE'S GONNA JUMP OFF THE GRAPH AS SURE AS HAWAIIANS FRY PINEAPPLE. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I READ A LOT ABOUT POLYGRAPHS AND... BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE NOT THAT CONCLUSIVE. DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ. IT'S MONEY IN THE BANK. OKAY, RIGHT HERE ON THE LEFT? THAT'S MY DENTIST'S OFFICE. I KNOW. I KNOW. YOU'VE ONLY BEEN COMING TO SEE THIS GUY... EVERY TUESDAY MORNING, LIKE CLOCKWORK. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT? WE'RE TOUCHY THIS MORNING, AREN'T WE? I WAS JUST THINKING THAT WITH ALL THE RENOVATION HE'S DOING, YOU STILL LOOK LIKE THE SAME OLD RENKO TO ME, I'M SAD TO SAY. WELL, IT'S JUST DEFENSIVE ORTHODONTIA. JUST SOME SUBTLE READJUSTMENT IN THE RENKO BITE. YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN FEEL ABOUT THE RENKO BITE. YES, I SURE DO. THEY SAY IT'S... THANKS A LOT. I'LL PICK YOU UP LATER ON. THE RENKO BITE. I DON'T KNOW. HE SAYS NOTHING'S DIFFERENT, BUT I'VE GOT A REAL KEEN RADAR... FOR THAT SORT OF THING, AND EVER SINCE THIS NEW WOMAN COME INTO HIS LIFE... I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOU MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING SOME JEALOUSY? JEALOUS? ME? UH-UH. HOW CAN I BE JEALOUS OF SOMEONE I NEVER EVEN MET? UH-UH. NO, THAT'S NOT IT. SEE, THIS IS HOW IT IS. BOBBY AND ME, WE BEEN REAL CLOSE FOR A LONG TIME. WE USED TO DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER. WE DOUBLE-DATED, WE WENT OUT AND PLAYED RACQUETBALL, WE WENT TO BARS... AND GOT ALL CRAZY AND DID EVERYTHING. BUT, SUDDENLY, HE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HER. AND WHEN I SAY, LIKE, LET'S GO OUT AND HAVE DINNER OR SOMETHING, HE JUST GETS KIND OF WEIRD ON ME. IT'S LIKE HE'S TRYING TO CUT, CUT ME OUT OF HIS LIFE OR SOMETHING. MAYBE HE'S AFRAID THAT YOU WON'T LIKE HER? WON'T LIKE HER? NOW WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT? WON'T LIKE HER? SHE'S HIS SQUEEZE, NOT MINE. ALL I'M SUGGESTING... IS THAT TWO MEN, AS CLOSE AS YOU ARE, WHO HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER AND DEPEND ON EACH OTHER... THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE BETWEEN YOU, AND I THINK THAT YOUR DISAPPROVAL WOULD BE VERY PAINFUL TO HIM. WELL, I CAN'T SEE IT. NO, I JUST CAN'T SEE IT AT ALL. - WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM? - BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE REASON. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S GOTTA BE. THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA STAY IN LAST NIGHT, MAN. I DID. MM-HMM. THAT BRAZILIAN CHICK CAME OVER WITH SOME JAYS AND A FIFTH OF RUM. CAN YOU GET ANYTHING DOWN YET, HONEY? GOT A SPECIAL TODAY ON I.V. UNITS. BRING HIM A CHILLED TOMATO JUICE... WITH LEMON, TABASCO AND A FRESH GRAPEFRUIT ON THE SIDE, WILL YA, BABE? HOW YOU DOING, DAPHNE? HELLO THERE, LITTLE HEIFER. HOW ARE YA? YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE OFF-COLOR THERE THIS MORNIN', J.D. YOU KNOW, I HATE COP HANGOUTS. IS THAT FRIDAY NIGHT? YEAH. THEY'RE GONNA PLAY THE CELTICS. IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD GAME. MAYBE YOU AND YOUR LADY WOULD LIKE TO COME. I'LL GET A CHANCE TO MEET THE FUTURE MRS. HILL. NO ONE'S RUSHING INTO ANYTHING, COWBOY. HOW ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT? THANKS, BUT WE'RE KINDA TIED UP. YOU KNOW, THE FAMILY. WOULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS? THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I COME IN HERE. I SWEAR, DO YOU HOSE THIS PLACE OFF EVERY TIME I COME IN HERE? YOU MUST HAVE HAD ONE MEAN SESSION, MAN. YOU'VE BEEN IN A FOUL MOOD EVER SINCE THAT APPOINTMENT. I'M NOT IN A FOUL MOOD. I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THIS HOBAN THING. I WISH THEY'D GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND GET THAT BOY TO TRIAL. I'LL TELL YOU. I COULD SAVE THIS CITY A LOT OF MONEY. YOU'LL GET YOUR DAY IN COURT. ESPECIALLY NOW THE PLAINCLOTHES CAUGHT HIM FOR YOU. - WHY DON'T YOU LET IT BE? - HEY, ANYTHING YOU SAY, BOOGA, BOOGA. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HARRIS. WHO YOU CALLIN' BOOGA, BOOGA? HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, RENKO? GIVE US A BREAK. I HEARD WHAT YOU CALL HIM. 'CAUSE HE'S MY PARTNER, HARRIS! HE'S MY MAIN SQUEEZE, AND I CAN CALL HIM... ANY DAMN THING I WANT TO, AND HE CAN DO THE SAME WITH ME. BUT YOU TRY IT AND I'M GONNA CHANGE YOUR FACE. RENKO, TAKE IT EASY. SANTINI, YOU BETTER STAY LOOSE, OR YOU AND THE MOUTH... WON'T LAST ONE MONTH UP ON THE HILL. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET US SOME FRESH AIR. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? OH, MAN. I AIN'T NEVER COMIN' IN HERE AGAIN. COME ON. SO, WHAT YOU GONNA HAVE, HUH? HARRIS WAS MOST ABUSIVE. THE TALLER ONE, HARRIS, CALLED ME EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK. I WASN'T RESISTING. I WAS JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO HIM, - AND HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME. - MR. KRINSKY HAS A MEDICAL PROBLEM... WHICH REQUIRED HIS MAKING TWO TRIPS TO THE MEN'S ROOM. WE HAVE MEDICAL AFFIDAVITS. NOW THIS ARRESTING REPORT ALLEGES... THIS IS TOTAL, FABRICATED GARBAGE. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN LITTLE BOYS. I JUST USE THE PUBLIC BATHROOM IN THE PARK. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME TO WALK. ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY. WE OWE YOU ONE, MR. KRINSKY. BUT IN THE FUTURE, DO US BOTH A FAVOR, PLEASE. GET YOURSELF A MEDICAL CARD AND CARRY IT. - LEO, GET HIM A RIDE, PLEASE. - RIGHT AWAY. I HOPE WE CAN MEET AGAIN, UNDER MORE PLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'LL BE JUST A MINUTE, MR. KRINSKY. WHAT'S WITH THAT KID IN THERE? IT SEEMS TO ME WE BOTH JUST WITNESSED... AN ASSAULT ON THAT CHILD BY YOUR DEKKER AVENUE VIGILANTES. AH, EXCUSE US, PLEASE. THAT KID IN THERE IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM. WE BUST HIM, TURN HIM OVER TO THE YOUTH AUTHORITY, AND THEY SPIT HIM RIGHT BACK OUT ONTO DEKKER AVENUE. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I'D SAY THEY EXERCISED A LOT OF CONTROL. WHAT'S IT GONNA BE WITH HIM? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BOOK HIM. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN INVESTIGATED THE CHARGES. GONNA LET HIS PAROLE OFFICER TAKE CARE OF THAT. THAT'S ASSUMING HE'S GUILTY. HE IS. REPEATEDLY. I SUPPOSE HECTOR RUIZ IS AN ANGEL BY COMPARISON. TWO MARKET HOLDUPS, FIVE HOSTAGES. HE'S DIFFERENT. YOU MEAN, YOU CHOSE TO MAKE HIM DIFFERENT. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH HIM ANYWAY? I'M WORKING ON A CHANGE OF FACILITY. SO FAR, SIX TURNDOWNS. YOU OUGHT TO SEND THAT OUT RIGHT AWAY. THE OLDER THE STAIN, THE HARDER IT IS TO UH... SORT OF LIKE RELATIONSHIPS. IS THAT A WARNING OR AN OBSERVATION? I'M HAVING ONE OF THOSE PHILOSOPHICAL DAYS. GOT TO ONCE IN A WHILE. YEAH, ME TOO. MY CLEANERS BURNED DOWN LAST NIGHT. FOUR SUITS GONE, POOF. NOT THAT BROWN TWEEDY THING WITH THE LITTLE BLUE SPECKS? UH-HUH. THAT'S A BLESSING. HEY. LOOK, YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY COMING UP. SUPPOSE WE GO DOWN TO CHARLES ST. IVES? CHARLES ST. IVES? I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD ONE OF HIS HANGERS, MUCH LESS... CHARLES ST. IVES? I'M NOT YOUR EX-HUSBAND, COUNSELOR. JOYCE'S TREAT. I DON'T THINK SO. I'M A BIG BOY. I'M USED TO DRESSING MYSELF. UNDRESSING IS ANOTHER MATTER. I REALLY HATE THAT STUBBORN STREAK IN YOU, FURILLO. NO, YOU DON'T. EXCUSE ME. YOUR OFFICE ON LINE FIVE, MS. DAVENPORT. YOU CAN TAKE IT ON MY PHONE. THANK YOU. YES, I DO. RAY'S GOT COMMANDER SWANSON ON SEVEN, FRANK. WE DIDN'T THINK YOU'D WANT TO TAKE IT IN YOUR OFFICE. RAY FILLED HIM IN ON THAT SANCTIONING BUSINESS. FURILLO. IT CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT, DAVE. I'VE GOT THE 6:00 NEWS LOCKED IN MY OFFICE, AND 12 ANGRY CITIZENS... COOLING THEIR HEELS IN ROLL CALL. DON'T TELL ME TO HANDLE IT, DAVE. THAT'S A POLICY DECISION, AND POLICY IS NOT MADE ON PRECINCT LEVEL. NO, YOU LISTEN... WILL YOU JUST TALK TO THEM, PLEASE? YOU TAKE OVER... HENRY, GO DOWNSTAIRS AND TELL THEM I'M WAITING FOR A DECISION ON POLICY FROM DIVISION. FOR REAL? WITH THAT NEWS CAMERA IN THERE, HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE. PHIL, WOULD YOU GET ME THAT NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH LITERATURE, IF WE STILL HAVE IT? PHIL, I'M TALKING TO YOU. COULD YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE, FRANCIS? I KNOW WHERE IT IS. I'LL DO IT. OH, OH, EXCUSE ME. IN FUTURE, YOUR ACTIVITIES WITHIN THIS PRECINCT... WILL CONFORM TO WHAT DOES NOT OBSTRUCT OR COMPLICATE OUR JOBS, NOT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE 6:00 NEWS. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE LIMITING MY ACCESS. YOU'RE MANIPULATING THE NEWS. OH, NO. BUT WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF MANIPULATION, THOSE 12 CITIZENS DOWNSTAIRS WOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED OF FORMING A VIGILANTE GROUP... UNLESS SOMEBODY PUT THE IDEA INTO THEIR HEADS. THAT SOMEBODY WAS YOU, ON YOUR NEWS SPECIAL LAST NIGHT, SO I'M TOLD. GOOD TIMING. IT HAPPENS. THAT HARDLY JUSTIFIES YOU TRYING TO ALTER THE REALITY OF THIS EVENT. OH, CLIMB OFF IT. YOU ALTER REALITY EVERY TIME YOU POINT A CAMERA AT IT. WHAT ABOUT THAT MARKET STICK-UP TWO DAYS AGO? YOU TRIED TO TURN THAT INTO A PROTEST FOR PUERTO RICAN STATEHOOD. MAY I INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN THAT YOU'RE AGAINST PUERTO RICAN STATEHOOD? NOT BAD. YOU DO HAVE A GIFT FOR STEERING CONVERSATION. IS THIS THE OLD SHIFT TO THE SOFT SELL, CAPTAIN? LOOK, WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT YOU, AND ABOUT COPS IN GENERAL, IS YOU DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO TURN AROUND, STOP FOR A MINUTE AND FIND OUT WHO YOUR FRIENDS REALLY ARE. YOU, FOR INSTANCE. MAYBE ME. BUT THE PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS DEFINITELY ARE. THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY'RE ON YOUR SIDE. ALL THEY WANT IS WHAT THEY'VE GOT A RIGHT TO HAVE. AND YOU'RE NOT GIVING IT TO THEM. THEY CAN'T WALK DOWN A STREET DAY OR NIGHT. HOW CAN YOU BLAME THEM FOR DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING? IF YOU OWNED A BUSINESS ON DEKKER AVENUE, YOU'D BE OUT THERE IN FRONT OF THE GROUP. MAYBE I WOULD. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. THE POINT IS, THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT COPS. SUPPOSE THEY LOCK HORNS WITH, SAY, THE GYPSY OR-OR THE BLOOD... OR-OR THE DRAGON... NOT TO MENTION THE 11 OTHER GANGS USING DEKKER AVENUE. I THINK YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING THE POWER AND THE COMPETENCY OF THESE PEOPLE. AND I THINK YOU UNDERESTIMATE HOW UGLY IT CAN GET OUT THERE AND HOW FAST IT CAN HAPPEN. SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA SANCTION THIS MERCHANTS GROUP, ARE YOU? YOU'RE JUST GONNA COOL THEM OFF DOWN THERE AND SEND THEM HOME. NO. DIVISION WANTS US TO REINSTITUTE A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH. OH, GREAT. THAT PROGRAM'S A JOKE, AND YOU KNOW IT. IT'S THE BIGGEST SCAM IN TOWN. IT HELPS US. IT APPEASES THEM. WELL, SUPPOSE WE JUST TAKE THE TIME TO FIND OUT? THAT'S NOT A HELL OF A LOT TO ASK, IS IT? BERNARD, WOULD YOU SET UP DOWNSTAIRS? THE CAPTAIN'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE. GOT YA. OKAY? YOU'RE STILL HERE. I'D CALL THAT A VICTORY OF SORTS. I WOULD CALL IT MORE LIKE A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE. HE THINKS THAT I PROVOKED THE DEKKER STREET MERCHANTS. IS HE RIGHT? SOMEONE HAD TO. YOU MIND IF I DIDN'T HEAR THAT? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S TO KNOW ABOUT HIM? IS HE MARRIED? I THINK HE USED TO BE. I'M NOT WILD ABOUT HIS TASTE IN SUITS, IF THAT'S ANY HELP. IF HE WEREN'T A COP, I... WELL, I'LL SEE YOU LATER. STILL HERE, COUNSELOR? CHARLES ST. IVES. 6:00 APPOINTMENT, FURILLO. FRANK. EXCUSE ME, MS. DAVENPORT. I JUST CALLED DOWNTOWN. HOBAN'S LIE DETECTOR IS INCONCLUSIVE. HOBAN? HE'S THE ONE WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER IN THE HILL AND RENKO SHOOTING. YES. WE'RE TURNING HIM LOOSE. WHAT ABOUT POSSESSION OF HEROIN? IT WAS NOT ON HIS PERSON, SO THEY WILL NOT PROSECUTE. SEE IF YOU CAN RAISE HILL AND RENKO FOR ME. AND WHEN HARRIS AND SANTINI COME BACK, TELL THEM I WANT TO SEE THEM TOO. ALL RIGHT. CAPTAIN, HEAR THIS. WE'RE NOT JUST GOING HOME. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE ORGANIZING AND GETTING OUR CAUSE ON TELEVISION. BECAUSE THIS... THIS IS AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE. WE'RE GONNA GET CARRY PERMITS AND THE POWER TO MAKE ARRESTS. WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR BACKING. LIKE I SAID BEFORE, IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL, CAPTAIN. IT'S JUST GOTTA GET DONE. MISS CHASE. ANDY, FIND YOUR PARTNER AND COME TO MY OFFICE. WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IT. HE COULDN'T HAVE. SO IT GOES, RENKO. IT'S THE WAY IT LAYS OUT. SO BIG DEAL. SO HE ZENS OUT AND PASSES SOME DUMB LIE DETECTOR TEST. WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH HIM GOING TO TRIAL? THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY TRIAL. THE EVIDENCE IS PURELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL. AND THE RESULTS OF HIS TESTS TIP THE SCALES... JUST ENOUGH IN HIS FAVOR SO THAT THE D.A. SAYS WE DON'T HAVE A CASE. CIRCUMSTANTIAL? AM I CIRCUMSTANTIAL? IS HE? TWELVE WEEKS COMBINED IN A HOSPITAL BED, TWO OF 'EM IN A COMA. IS THAT CIRCUMSTANTIAL? YOU PUT ME ON THAT STAND. I'LL GIVE 'EM A CASE. BOBBY DIDN'T SEE HIM, SO IT'S JUST YOUR WORD AGAINST HIS, AND BELIEVE ME, HIS LAWYER WILL TAKE YOUR TESTIMONY... AND RIP IT TO SHREDS WITHOUT EVEN BREAKING A SWEAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? YEAH, I THINK I DO, SO JUST COOL DOWN AND HAVE A SEAT. OKAY? WHAT'S YOUR VISION, ANDY, WITHOUT YOUR GLASSES? COME ON, THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION HIS LAWYER'S GONNA ASK YOU, SO ANSWER IT. 20/40. IT'S 20/50. AND YOU WEREN'T WEARING YOUR GLASSES WHEN YOU WALKED IN THAT HALLWAY, WERE YOU? WHAT KIND OF LIGHTING WAS IN THAT HALLWAY? COME ON! WAS IT INCANDESCENT, A CEILING FIXTURE, WALL, WHAT? - IT WAS DAYLIGHT. - JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION. IT WAS, UM, IT WAS THAT OVERHEAD LIGHTING, THAT KIND OF INCANDESCENT... IT WAS NEITHER, RENKO. THERE WAS NO LIGHTING AT ALL. AND THE WINDOWS WERE BOARDED OVER. SO LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU WALKED INTO AN UNLIGHTED HALLWAY. YOU HAVE 20/50 VISION. THE AFTERNOON SUN WAS STILL IN YOUR EYES, AND WITHIN TWO SECONDS... ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN DEPOSITION... YOU GOT SMACKED. I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. IT'S THE WAY IT PLAYS IN COURT. I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WALK OUT OF HERE... THINKING THAT I DON'T SHARE YOUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION. WE ALL DO. JUST TAKE THE REST OF THE DAY OFF. IT HAPPENS, YOU GUYS. I'M SORRY. AWFUL QUIET IN THERE, BOBBY. I DON'T THINK I HEARD YOU AS MUCH AS CLEAR YOUR THROAT. WHAT'S THERE TO SAY? WORDS GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING? MAY MAKE YOU EASIER TO LIVE WITH, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, RENKO, WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S EATING AT YOU, I'VE JUST ABOUT HAD ENOUGH OF IT. OH, IS THAT SO? YEAH. WELL, BESIDES MY LIFE, AND THIS LOUSY SYSTEM I WORK IN, WHAT'S EATING AT ME IS YOU. ME? WHY? BECAUSE I WOULDN'T LIE ABOUT SEEIN' THE SHOOTING? I CAN'T DO THAT. AND I TOLD YOU WHY. NOW, IF YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU AGAIN, I WILL. NO, NO, NO. ACTUALLY, WHAT'S BOTHERING ME IS HOW YOU'VE BEEN SINCE THEN. YOU'VE CUT ME OUT OF YOUR LIFE, MAN. LET ME TELL YOU, YOU CAN BE ONE COLD SLICE WHEN YOU WANT TO BE. MY LIFE'S NOT MY OWN. YOU KNOW, WITH PAMELA AND THE KIDS. NO. I DO NOT KNOW PAMELA. I DO NOT KNOW THE KIDS, BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT INTRODUCED THEM TO ME. NOT EVEN ONCE. THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT IS. AND YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND. UNDERSTAND WHAT? MY OWN PARTNER DOESN'T WANT ME IN HIS HOUSE? I AM HOUSEBROKEN, BOBBY. I HAVEN'T MESSED ON THE RUG IN YEARS NOW. OR MAYBE IT'S HER. MAYBE SHE JUST DON'T COTTON TO WHITE BOYS. SHE IS WHITE. AND I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT. OH, YOU DO, DO YOU? THAT'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW ME SO WELL. BECAUSE YOU'RE THE WORLD'S FOREMOST EXPERT ON ANDREW RENKO, HUH? GUYS? EXCUSE ME. I JUST WANTED TO GET IN MY TWO CENTS' WORTH. WE KNOW, SARGE. WE KNOW YOU KNOW THE KID. MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE TIME. BUT... I THINK WE'D BE DOING OURSELVES A FAVOR IF WE TRY TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY... THAT EDDIE HOBAN DIDN'T PULL THAT TRIGGER. I'M JUST SUGGESTING WE TRY IT. SEEMS LIKE IT HITS YOU EVERYWHERE YOU TURN THESE DAYS, DON'T IT? ACCEPT THIS, ACCEPT THAT, COPE WITH THIS, DEAL WITH THAT, UNDERSTAND WHERE HE'S COMING FROM, IDENTIFY WITH HIS SITUATION... I SWEAR, I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYMORE. IT'S JUST WORDS, MAN. - SMOKE AND WORDS. - COME ON, MAN... NO, NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I... I CAN DO THAT. I SWEAR I CAN. I'LL CATCH YOU ALL LATER. SORRY. I JUST THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP A LITTLE. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU NEVER KNOW WITH HIM. I CAN'T SAY THAT I DON'T BLAME HIM. FRANK, SORRY ABOUT THIS, BUT HOW LONG BEFORE YOU CAN REASSEMBLE THAT DEKKER AVENUE GROUP? WHY? WE'RE GOING TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR ASSOCIATION. WHAT DID YOU TELL ME ON THE PHONE? YOU SAID NO, CATEGORICALLY NO. THIS IS STRAIGHT FROM CHIEF DANIELS. HE WANTS 'EM TO HAVE SPACE TO WORK OUT OF, TWO-WAY RADIOS, C.P.R. TRAINING, THE WORKS. GUN PERMITS? SOON AS THEY QUALIFY. DAVE, THIS IS CRAZY! I WON'T STAND FOR IT. DON'T ZING ME, FRANK. MY HANDS ARE TIED. YOU KNOW HOW DANIELS GETS WITH THE MEDIA ON HIS BACK. WHAT I THINK'S GOING ON IS HE'S THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR MAYOR AGAIN. I KNOW. AND I'M SORRY. BUT THAT'S THE NEW POLICY. IF THAT'S A COFFEE STAIN, I'D PUT CLUB SODA ON IT. COMMANDER, ARE YOU SANCTIONING THE DEKKER AVENUE MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION? CAPTAIN FURILLO WILL LAY IT OUT FOR YOU. EXCUSE ME. HILL STREET. - PHIL? TELEPHONE. - CINDY? I BELIEVE IT'S TRENCH. LET ME TELL HIM YOU'RE GONE. HE'LL ONLY CALL BACK. I MEAN GONE, AS IN MUERTE. ESTERHAUS. MOVE IT, DOG BREATH. BATES? YEAH. CAN YOU BOOK THIS GARBAGE FOR ME? I GOTTA BLOW OUTTA HERE. I'M LATE. MICK, I GOT A TON OF PAPERWORK. YOU CAN HAVE THE COLLAR. THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. SIT DOWN! HE LIFTED THIS BABY FROM ABE'S SOCIALIST TV AND APPLIANCES. NICE. CUTE LITTLE GUY, HUH? NAME? LEWIS. ROBERT Q. PHIL. A WORD? OF COURSE, HENRY. LOOK, I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT RAY TOOK THE LIBERTY... OF CONFIDING YOUR SITUATION TO ME, AND I'M-I'M CONCERNED. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SEND A UNIT OUT, PICK THE GUY UP AND BRING HIM IN? FOR WHAT? HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING. PHIL, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO PROVE BY GOING OUT THERE. A MAN DOES WHAT HE HAS TO, HENRY. OKAY. LISTEN. I KNOW YOU DON'T GO MUCH FOR NONFICTION, BUT, UH... WOULD YOU CONSIDER... GIVING THIS A BROWSE BEFORE YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT MEETING TRENCH? "YOUR KIND, MY KIND, HUMANKIND." BY HELMUT SHIMMERFELDT. NOW, IT'S NOT HIS BEST WORK... IT READS A LITTLE SIMPLISTICALLY... BUT THE GUY'S GOT SOME BASICALLY VALID THINGS TO SAY... ABOUT THE WAY WE MEN CONFUSE EGO WITH DUTY. A LOT OF IT'S HORMONAL ACTUALLY. I DON'T KNOW, HENRY. READ IT. SARGE, WHAT'RE YOU DOING? ASK NOT FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, MICK. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? DOES THAT MEAN SOMETHING? WELL, IT MEANS THAT I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DESTINY. YOU'RE GOING OUT TO MEET THAT HAIR BAG TRENCH, AREN'T YOU? WORD GETS AROUND, HUH? LOOK, I PROMISED DEBBIE I'D PICK HER UP AT ART CLASS. LEMME CANCEL THAT AND COME ALONG. UH-UH. MAYBE I COULD RIP HIS STOMACH OUT FOR YOU. OKAY. I'LL ONLY BACK YOU UP. I DON'T WANT ANY PIECE OF THE COLLAR. MICK, I APPRECIATE YOUR LOYALTY. AND POUND FOR POUND, THERE'S NOT ANOTHER OFFICER I WOULD RATHER HAVE COVERING MY DORSAL. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A MAN, IF HE'S A MAN, DOES WHAT A MAN MUST DO. PERHAPS IT'S HORMONAL. THAT'S FAR ENOUGH. I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THIS. MAKE YOUR MOVE. I AIN'T ARMED. WE BOTH KNOW YOU DON'T NEED A WEAPON... TO KILL A MAN, TRENCH. THAT'S FAR ENOUGH. I ONLY GOT ONE THING TO SAY. - YOUR DIME. - I LOVE YOU, PHIL. I THINK YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SLAM TOO LONG, KERMIT. I MEAN, IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE. I'VE BEEN SAVED, BY THE LOVE OF OUR SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST. I, UH, HAD WHAT YOU CALL AN EPIPHANY, UP THERE IN THE STIR. ALL THEM LONG, EMPTY DAYS, TERROR-FILLED NIGHTS. MEN SCREAMING. ME, LYING THERE THINKING... OF ALL THE TERRIBLE CRIMES I DID OVER THE YEARS. THE TIME WE SHOT IT OUT IN THIS ALLEY HERE. REMEMBER? INDELIBLY. I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO KEEP FROM GOING NUTS. I STARTED READING THE BIBLE. ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER. I WAS REBORN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I'LL BE A HAPPY MAN... IF YOU CAN SAY YOU FORGIVE ME FOR THE PAIN AND SUFFERING I CAUSED YOU. CONSIDER YOURSELF FORGIVEN. - TAKE IT. IT'S MY BIBLE. - NO, I COULDN'T. MM-MMM. GOD BLESS YOU, PHIL. UNARMED, UNARMED, UNARMED WOMAN COMING THROUGH. LOOK, MOM, NO GUN. - FRANK! - HI, FAY. HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE. GREAT STAIN. THANKS FOR COMING UP HERE. WELL, I APPRECIATE BEING INVITED. WHAT, AM I UNDER ARREST? I GOT THIS KID I MADE A PROMISE TO. I NEED A FAVOR. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BAIL OUT... OF TAKING FRANK JR. TO THE BASKETBALL GAME... WHOA. I DON'T MEAN FRANK JR. HE'S A 15-YEAR-OLD PUERTO RICAN KID NAMED HECTOR. HE'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF JUVENILE AUTHORITY SINCE HE WAS 12. NO FATHER, A MOTHER WHO WORKS. THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR. BRIGHT, GIFTED AND VERY TROUBLED. I'M AFRAID IF WE DON'T GET HIM OUT OF THE SYSTEM NOW, HE'S NEVER GONNA GET OUT. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? ADOPT HIM? HE COULD DO WORSE. WHAT I'M AFTER IS A REFERRAL FROM HARVEY TO SOME PRIVATE INSTITUTION, SOMETHING LIKE STONY BROOK IN ARIZONA. STONY BROOK, SURE. I MEAN, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, BUT, UH, I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT A WAITING LIST AS LONG AS YOUR ARM. REFERRALS FROM JUVENILE AUTHORITY JUDGES FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY ARE SOMETHING, FRANK. YOU DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME WITH YOUR OWN SON, AND HERE YOU ARE, TRYING TO PULL OFF THE MIRACLE OF THE CENTURY FOR SOME STREET KID YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW. I DO KNOW HIM. AND I MADE HIM A PROMISE. DO I DETECT A LITTLE EGO INVOLVEMENT HERE? FRANK, WE ALL MAKE PROMISES. AND WE ALL UNMAKE THEM. OKAY. LET ME GO THROUGH HARVEY'S FILES, AND I'LL MAKE A FEW INQUIRIES, AND, UM, I'LL SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE. THINK YOU CAN GET A LETTER OUT OF HIM? SURE. THANKS. I OWE YOU ONE. MORE THAN ONE.
