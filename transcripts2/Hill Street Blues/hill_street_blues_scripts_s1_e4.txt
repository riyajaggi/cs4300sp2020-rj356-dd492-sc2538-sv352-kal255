 Hill Street Blues (1981–1987): Season 1, Episode 4 - Can World War III Be an Attitude? - full transcript 
 Esterhaus finds himself tempted by a new woman when Grace Gardner returns to decorate the precinct and won't take no for an answer. LaRue has his first hearing and draws support from both partner Washington and captain Furillo. Lucy Bates questions her femininity when Hunter asks her to join his team. A car jacking leads Hill and Renko to arrest "Malibu," who turns out to be completely willing to confess and pay back his time doing fix-up work around the precinct. And with Furillo out at LaRue's hearing, the hill finds itself under siege from gangs angry with the president canceling his walking tour.
