 Hill Street Blues (1981–1987): Season 1, Episode 2 - Presidential Fever - full transcript 
 The precinct prepares for the president's visit, calling a summit of the various gang leader's in the hopes the president can get in and out of the city without being killed or putting the city's citizens at risk. But tempers flare as rival gangs find out whose territory the president will visit, and whose he won't. Division decides that the city's police stations need "sprucing up." The Hill is first on the list for official department decorator Grace Gardner, a fiery redhead who immediately clashes with Sargent Phil Esterhaus. He'd rather see the money spent on real issues for the department. Hill and Renko return to the job after several weeks in the hospital, but can't come to terms with working together again. Bobby admits he's scared after the shooting, and Renko can't seem to forgive Bobby for not ever coming to visit him in the hospital. Belker makes it a priority to bring in the two rapists who continue to assault women in St. James Park. New uniformed cops Harris and Fuentes let a good bust go to their heads, and when the roust a group of Latino men moving out of an apartment and accuse them of actually stealing someone's furniture, the two cops are jumped. When they organize the rest of the cops to help them with "softball practice" where they intend to take baseball bats back to the community and recover their guns, Furillo shuts it down. Furrillo's personal problems persist when he gets served by his ex-wife to pay more child support, and he can't find the time to actually meet with Joyce Davenport for more than an hour at a time.

FOR A PRESS SECRETARY, YOU'VE GOT A SHORT MEMORY, MR. PARKER. IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SHOW, YOU'LL BE GONE... AND I'LL BE STUCK WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF 10,000 UNMET EXPECTATIONS. WHAT TROUBLES ME HERE, CAPTAIN, IS YOUR PERCEPTION OF THE COMMUNITY UP THERE. YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A LOOSE COLLECTION OF BANANA REPUBLICS. IN A SENSE, THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING ANOTHER COMMUNITY IN ANOTHER CITY. HILL STREET'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S LOOKING FOR, MR. PARKER. BELIEVE ME. IT'S REALLY DISGUSTING UP THERE. YOU'LL GET SOME INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE FOOTAGE. IF YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH IT, FRANK, I'LL PUT SOMEONE ON IT WHO CAN. COMMANDER, MR. PARKER, CAPTAIN FURILLO... IS THE ONLY POLICE OFFICER UP THERE... WHO'S RESPECTED BY EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE YOUTH GANGS. ALL WE REALLY HAVE TO DO IS CONVENE A SUMMIT MEETING, TELL THEM THE PRESIDENT'S COMING, AND THEN... TAKE IT FROM THERE.

LISTEN, FRANK, I CAN UNDERSTAND IT IF YOU CAN'T FORGIVE ME. COME ON, HENRY. I FORGIVE YOU. NO, REALLY... I MEAN IT. DON'T FOLD ON ME NOW. I NEED YOU TO GO BACK AND SET UP THAT SUMMIT. HOW COULD I HAVE SAID THAT? BECAUSE IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR. SEE IF YOU CAN GET 'EM ALL IN FOR, SAY, 4:00. I GOT A LUNCH DATE I'M ALREADY LATE FOR. I'LL BE BACK RIGHT AFTER. I THINK THE BONE MIGHT BE... OH, I'M SURE THE BONE IS A TERRIFIC COLOR FOR THIS AREA. IT'LL GO WITH THE OCCASIONAL BLOODSTAIN. ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT.

WELL, HALLELUJAH, COWBOY. I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO "DIFFERENT." I STILL GOTTA GET PAST BEIN' SCARED. WELL, I'M NOT SCARED OF ANYTHING OR ANYBODY, MY FRIEND. PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SCARED OF ME. LYIN' IN THAT HOSPITAL BED, I THOUGHT GOD MAY HAVE GIVEN ME A BODY LIKE A B-52, BUT HE ALSO GAVE ME A BRAIN. WE DON'T NEED TO PROVE WE CAN GO OUT THERE AGAIN, BOBBY. THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT FOR BOTH OF US. IF WE SHOW 'EM WE GOT SOMETHIN' BETWEEN OUR EARS, WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SNIPER MEAT. SORRY TO BUST UP YOUR REUNION, BUT, UH, PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO TALK. RENKO?

RELATIONSHIPS DON'T MATURE ON A DIET OF 20-MINUTE LUNCHES. I HAD A MEETING THIS MORNING WITH RANDY PARKER, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, SAY, "EXCUSE ME, GIVE THE PRESIDENT MY REGARDS, BUT I GOT A HOT LUNCH DATE"? IF IT WAS AN ISOLATED SITUATION, THAT WOULD BE ONE THING. BUT IT ISN'T. JOYCE, PLEASE. I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE MORNING. I NEED A LITTLE RELIEF. CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER? WHEN? TONIGHT. NO OFFENSE, CAPTAIN, BUT I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT TONIGHT. I WANNA DO OTHER THINGS. PERFECT.

THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. I COULD HAVE ARRESTED THAT MAN. I SHOULD HAVE! WE REALLY LIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS, FRANK. NOT SO DIFFERENT, COUNSELOR.

AFTER ALL, IT'S A MEDIA EVENT. BUT IT'S A NEWS EVENT. NOBODY GETS PAID FOR BEING ON THE NEWS. AL PACINO DON'T WORK FOR NOTHIN', MAN. HUH? THAT'S RIGHT. GET HIM. HE THINKS HE'S AL PACINO.

ANY BEEFS BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, YOU RUN 'EM THROUGH THE STATION. THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL. BE COOL. BE COOL. UH, CAPTAIN, IF I COULD SAY JUST A FEW WORDS HERE... IT'S COOL, PARKER. LEAVE 'EM BE. EASY, CAPTAIN. GUYS, I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS, ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT, HIS APPRECIATION. NOW, HE WOULDN'T BE COMING UP HERE IF HE DIDN'T CARE, IF HE WASN'T ON YOUR SIDE. YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY? SO, THANKS, YOU GUYS, AND... HE'S GOTTA BE IN THE GOVERNMENT. STAY COOL. HAD TO GET INTO IT, DIDN'T YOU? I WARNED YOU, PARKER...

BEFORE YOU RUN OFF AT THE MOUTH, PARKER, IF HIS MOTHER GETS A PICTURE WITH THE PRESIDENT, THEY'RE ALL GONNA WANT PICTURES, AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE MOTHERS, THERE'LL BE GIRLFRIENDS AND COUSINS. I'M SORRY, MAN. AND I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER. I DIDN'T KNOW. ASÍ ES LA VIDA, BRO. AS FOR YOU, MR. G-MAN, IF YOU SEND OUT ANY SOCIAL PROGRAM CHECKS, YOU SEND 'EM TO ME.

YOU'RE GONNA LET 'EM GET AWAY WITH IT? WHAT IF ONE OF THOSE GUNS KILLS A COP? HARRIS, THERE ARE ENOUGH GUNS OUT THERE TO KILL EVERY ONE OF US A DOZEN TIMES OVER! I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S BLADDER ABOUT YOUR GUNS! WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT, AND WHAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME, IS THE KIND OF MORALITY I'M SEEING HERE. FRANCIS, THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT TO THIS... PRIDE. PROFESSIONAL PRIDE. THAT'S WHY THE MEN WANTED TO HANDLE THIS, UH, INFORMALLY, SO TO SPEAK. WELL, IF THIS IS HOW YOU SHOW YOUR PRIDE, THEN TURN IN YOUR BLUES AND GET THE HELL OUT OF MY PRECINCT. WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE CAN TRUST. IF YOU GO OUT THERE LIKE A BUNCH OF NIGHT RIDERS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU BUT JUST ANOTHER VICIOUS STREET GANG? UM, LET'S ACCEDE TO THE CAPTAIN'S WISHES ON THIS ONE, HUH? SHALL WE? RAINED OUT. THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD SEE YOU TONIGHT. NOT TONIGHT, FRANK. I'VE GOT A TON OF HOMEWORK. I'M IN APPEALS COURT IN THE MORNING AT 8:00 A.M. I'M SORRY ABOUT TODAY. SO AM I. NO. NO, I'M NOT. LOOK, UH, FRANK, THE LONGER I SEE YOU, IT'S GOTTEN MORE COMPLICATED...
