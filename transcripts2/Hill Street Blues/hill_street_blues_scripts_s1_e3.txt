IT'S NOT GOIN' AWAY. AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. - I - TALK TO THE CAPTAIN TODAY. IN THE MEANTIME, I EXPECT YOU BOTH TO GO RIGHT ON SERVING YOUR FELLOW MAN. OKAY, COWBOY, YOU HEARD THE MAN. STOP THAT COWBOY STUFF. I WAS BORN IN NEW JERSEY. I NEVER BEEN WEST OF CHICAGO IN MY LIFE. DISPATCH. WE HAVE A 9-11. ARMED ROBBERY IN PROGRESS. SEE SURPLUS STORE, CORNER PEOPLE'S DRIVE, 124th STREET. IT'S BEEN A WHILE, FRANK. COMMENT ÇA VA? HELLO, HOWARD. I THOUGHT I SMELLED THAT TOBACCO BLEND OF YOURS. WHAT IS THAT STUFF? IT'S CALLED DUTCHMAN'S GOLD. MY TOBACCONIST IMPORTS IT FROM INDONESIA. GREAT AROMA, HOWARD. YOU MIGHT START THINKING ABOUT INDONESIA, FRANK. SOME LITTLE DUGOUT UP IN THE BAMBOO. IF I WERE YOU, I'D CONSIDER IT. WHY IS THAT, HOWARD? OH, JUDAS PRIEST. FRANK, YOU'VE GOT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON THE FRONT BURNER, AND YOU'RE STANDING AROUND HERE WITH YOUR PANTS DOWN AROUND YOUR SUPPORT HOSE. OH. SO, THE WORD'S OUT, IS IT? THE WORD? HELL, I KNOW IT. YOU KNOW IT. EVERY GEEK WITH A WILD HAIR KNOWS IT. DOGGONE, I DON'T SUPPORT THE MAN'S GUTLESS POLITICS, BUT HE IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE. SECURITY PLANS ARE ALREADY IN THE WORKS, HOWARD. I'M SURE YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED IN DUE COURSE. AH. YOU'RE BLOWING BROWN SMOKE AT ME, FRANK. WHAT IS THE OPERATIONAL TABLEAU? IT'S STILL TENTATIVE, HOWARD, BUT THEY'LL MOST LIKELY LAND THE CHOPPER IN THE SOUTH END OF ST. JAMES PARK. FROM THERE, THEY'LL PROCEED ON FOOT INTO THE AVENUES. YOU KNOW, IT'S A WONDER THEY CAN BUCKLE THEIR CHIN STRAPS, MUCH LESS RUN A GOVERNMENT. FRANK, A STEYR S.S.G. HITS FROM A THOUSAND YARDS, AND THEY'RE COMMON AS DIRT. I'M AWARE OF THAT, HOWARD. FRANK, LOOK AROUND HERE. YOU GOT YOUR TENEMENTS, BOTH OCCUPIED AND EMPTY. YOU GOT YOUR COMMERCIALS, BOTH OCCUPIED AND EMPTY. BOTH OCCUPIED AND EMPTY. YES, I KNOW. ALL WELL WITHIN THAT RANGE. JUDAS PRIEST! YOU'RE INVITING ANY MISFIT... WITH A SNIPER'S MENTALITY TO TAKE A WHACK AT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE. HOWARD, COULD YOU... HALF THE PEOPLE IN THIS PRECINCT AREN'T EVEN AMERICAN CITIZENS. THEY'RE ILLEGAL, FOREIGN PERVERTS AND MALCONTENTS. THEY DON'T EVEN USE OUR LANGUAGE. HOWARD, COULD YOU SUM THIS UP FOR ME? I'M RUNNING LATE. GIVE THE ORDER, FRANK, AND I'LL HAVE THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EVACUATED... IN 18 HOURS. YOU WON'T FIND A COCKROACH BETWEEN HERE AND THE RESERVOIR. HOWARD, THE WHOLE IDEA IS FOR THE PRESIDENT TO MEET THE PUBLIC, REVIEW CONDITIONS UP HERE HIMSELF, DEMONSTRATE HIS CONCERN FOR THE DISADVANTAGED. HE CAN'T DO THAT, HOWARD, IF YOU EVACUATE THE POPULATION. FOLLY, FRANK. PURE AND SENSELESS FOLLY. NO, HOWARD, POLITICS. WHO KNOWS? MAYBE SOME GOOD WILL COME OF IT. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT.

I DON'T NEED NO INSURANCE, JIM. I AIN'T NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT BEFORE IN MY LIFE! EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE TIME I CLIPPED THIS DUDE'S OLD LADY CROSSING AGAINST THE LIGHT, BUT THAT WASN'T MY FAULT. ALL RIGHT. WHO WANTS TO START? I'M COMIN' OUT MY GARAGE... I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE STREET. THIS MAN'S COMING DOWN THE STREET...

FAY FURILLO, PLEASE. RAY, WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME? JUST A SECOND. SURE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, FRANK? YEAH, YEAH. I JUST HAVE TO MAKE A PERSONAL CALL. HELLO? FAY, THIS IS REALLY THE LOWEST. WH-WHAT DO YOU THINK, I GOT A SWISS BANK ACCOUNT... WITH A MILLION BUCKS SQUIRRELED AWAY OR SOME... I JUST TALKED TO MY LAWYER. YEAH? WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, FAY. Y... THE LETTER... CAN THEY REALLY DO WHAT HE SAYS? GARNISH YOUR WAGES, NO. THERE ARE LAWS THAT PROTECT YOU FROM THAT SORT OF THING. THEN WHAT THE HELL IS SHE TRYING TO DO? I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO BULLY YOU INTO PAYING MORE CHILD SUPPORT. I'M BROKE. I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE. EVEN IF I DID, THAT KIND OF THING IS BLACKMAIL, ISN'T IT? THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF DIVORCES, FRANK. IN ONE KIND, THE COUPLE BREAKS UP, SPLITS THE PROPERTY, WORKS OUT THE CUSTODY OF THE KIDS... AND GOES THEIR SEPARATE WAYS. IN THE OTHER KIND, THE TWO PEOPLE BREAK UP, SPLIT THE PROPERTY, WORK OUT THE CUSTODY OF THE KIDS... AND THEN CONTINUE TO SCRATCH AT ALL THE PROBLEMS... THAT ITCHED THEM IN THEIR MARRIAGE. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THEY DO IT LONG DISTANCE BETWEEN THE LAWYERS. WHAT KIND OF DIVORCE DO YOU HAVE? WHAT SHOULD I DO? WELL, YOU CAN RESPOND WITH A LAWYER'S LETTER OF YOUR OWN, BUT THAT WILL NECESSITATE A RESPONSE FROM HER LAWYER, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, AD INFINITUM. AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WILL GET YOUR MONEY WILL BE THE LETTER WRITERS. OR THE TWO OF YOU CAN SIT DOWN LIKE TWO ADULTS AND REVIEW THE SITUATION. I'M EXTENDED TO THE LIMIT AS IT IS. HAVE YOU GOTTEN A RAISE IN THOSE TWO YEARS? - JUST COST OF LIVING. - HAS FAY? ALL RIGHT, I SURRENDER. I'LL TALK TO HER. DON'T DO IT FOR ME, FRANK. DO IT FOR YOUR SON... AND YOURSELF. YOU'D HAVE MADE A HELL OF A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR, COUNSELOR. REMEMBER THIS BRACELET? MMM. WE GOT IT IN THAT LITTLE ANTIQUE SHOP. MM-HMM. THE FIRST WEEKEND WE EVER SPENT TOGETHER. OH... GOLD... IT SUITS YOU, DAVENPORT. I LOVE YOU. AND I LOVE THAT BRACELET. BUT IT'S NOT DOING EITHER OF US ANY GOOD SITTING ON MY WRIST. OH, NO. NO, NO, NO. I'D HOCK MY WATCH BEFORE I'D LET YOU DO THAT. CAN I OFFER YOU A LOAN? UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, JOYCE. IF MY SON NEEDED AN OPERATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I'D JUMP ON YOUR OFFER IN A SECOND. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS IS BETWEEN FAY AND ME. AND I DON'T WANT YOU IN THE MIDDLE. CAN I SEE YOU TONIGHT? CAN YOU PROMISE YOU WON'T RUN OUT ON ME WHEN THAT BUZZER GOES OFF? I DON'T WANNA PROMISE SOMETHING I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER. FAIR ENOUGH. LET ME THINK ABOUT IT AND CALL YOU LATER? I LOVE YOU, MONEYBAGS. WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE? DISPATCH, I GOT AN ASSAULT COMPLAINT. 943 BEEKMAN AVENUE, APARTMENT THREE, THIRD FLOOR. HOW ABOUT, UH, HINGLE AND PEREZ? NO, FORGET THAT. PULL HILL AND RENKO OFF THE PARK. CORNER ROOM TO THE LEFT, OFFICERS. HE'S BEATING HER SOMETHING AWFUL! ALL RIGHT IN THERE. OPEN UP THE DOOR. POLICE. HE'S CRAZY, MAN. HE'S GOT A GUN! I SAID OPEN UP THE DOOR, OR I'M GONNA KICK IT IN! RENKO, THE WOMAN SAID HE'S GOT A GUN. LET'S JUST CALL FOR SOME BACKUPS. YOU SCARED? NO! NO! KICK IT. GET OUTTA HERE! COME ON, MAN, KICK IT! NO! NO! CALL IN A COUPLE BACKUPS AND THE MEDICS. I'M GOING AFTER HIM. SORRY. DON'T... DON'T SHOOT ME, MAN. BOBBY? WHAT YOU DOING? YOU TURN ON THE LIGHTS? I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA KILL HIM, MAN. SO HE COULD DUST ME! HE COULD'VE KILLED ME, MAN! HE COULD'VE KILLED ME! HE COULD'VE KILLED ME! HE COULD'VE KILLED ME! FRANK... FRANK, I HAVE A HALF A DOZEN CALLS HERE FROM PARKER. YOU'D THINK WE HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN HOLD THAT GUY'S HAND. PLUS, YOUR EX-WIFE CALLED. HER I WANT. AND YOU GOT A FIRE TO PUT OUT OVER THERE. YEAH, I, UH, THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET TOGETHER TONIGHT, TALK. TONIGHT. LOOK, I GET OUTTA HERE ABOUT 7:00. LET'S SAY WE MEET SOMEPLACE IN THE OPEN. SALLY'S CLAM HOUSE? YEAH, I KNOW THE PLACE. 8:00's COOL. I GOT HALF A DOZEN REPORT CARDS HERE FROM CIVILIANS... WHO SEEM TO THINK YOU'RE A COUPLE OF OUTPATIENTS FROM COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC. WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU? IT'S NOT WORKING OUT, CAPTAIN. YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES SOMETIMES. NO, I DON'T, RENKO. EDUCATE ME. I WANT TO GO INTO PLAINCLOTHES. - ESTERHAUS PROMISED ME HE'D TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S RUN THE REQUEST UP TO DIVISION. YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THE PRECINCT. - WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? - HIM. FINE. THEN IT'S SOLVED... YOU'RE DIVORCED. - JUST LIKE THAT? - YOU GOT IT, HILL. JUST LIKE THAT. I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES. YOU WALKED IN THE WRONG DOORWAY AND GOT SMACKED. YOU BOTH OUGHTA BE DEAD. NOT BECAUSE YOU SCREWED UP, AND NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE BAD COPS. YOU'RE NOT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU'RE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD. BUT IT HAPPENS. AND IF YOU SURVIVE, IT'S NEVER LIKE IT WAS. IT'S ALWAYS WITH YOU. THE "WHAT IFS." "WHICH ONE OF US FAILED?" AND THE SHAME, EMBARRASSMENT, THE ANGER... AND MOST OF ALL, THE FEAR OF GOING BACK OUT THERE. WELL, IT DOESN'T FAZE ME, CAPTAIN. THAT'S BULL. YOU WERE SCARED OUTTA YOUR SOCKS. TURNIN' ON THAT LIGHT SWITCH. WHO'S TELLIN' WHO WHO'S SCARED? SURE, I WAS. BUT I CAN ADMIT IT, RENKO. - I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. - THEN ADMIT IT. YOU'RE SWIMMIN' IN IT! ALL RIGHT. SO I'M NERVOUS OUT THERE. BIG DEAL. YOU JUST MAKE ME PLAINCLOTHES, AND I'LL GET OVER THAT REAL FAST! I TOLD YOU I'D PROCESS THE REQUEST, RENKO, AND I WILL. CLEAR? YES, SIR. MEANTIME, I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR ACTS TOGETHER INDIVIDUALLY, OR NEITHER ONE OF YOU HAS MUCH OF A FUTURE. HOW YOU DO THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS. BUT I WON'T TOLERATE INCOMPETENCE ON THE JOB, NOT FOR ANY REASON. UNTIL I HEAR OTHERWISE, PHIL WILL BE FINDING YOU SEPARATE DUTY ASSIGNMENTS. OH, MAN, DON'T START THAT. WOULD YOU STOP IT, MAN? DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. YOU WOULDN'T LAST MORE THAN 10 MINUTES OUT THERE WITHOUT ME ANYWAY. OH, YEAH? I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING TOO GOOD WITH YA ANYWAY. AH. OH, JESUS. WE NEED EACH OTHER, BOBBY. I'M AFRAID WE DO, COWBOY. LOOK, UH, WHY DON'T WE JUST GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT... AND, UH, GO BACK TO WORK? RIGHT. YEAH. OH, GOD. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS THING NONSTOP. IT'S REALLY MESSED UP MY HEAD. NOW, LOOK, WHATEVER YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE INTO, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS. I DON'T WANT NO PART OF IT. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE MONEY BACK. DETECTIVE LaRUE. WE'RE FROM INTERNAL AFFAIRS. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. NOTHING TURNS MY STOMACH LIKE A CROOKED COP. YEAH. ALL RIGHT! THIS THE WAY YOU WANNA PLAY IT, HUH, MACAFEE? OKAY. OKAY. FEEL BETTER? I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED A GOOD SOAK. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED, FURILLO? HMM? A FACIAL. HOW ABOUT IT? ABSOLUTELY. I'VE NEEDED ONE OF THOSE FOR YEARS. AND THEN A PROLONGED BODY MASSAGE... WITH APRICOT LOTION. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PARTICULARLY FOND OF APRICOTS, COUNSELOR. MMM. PHIL, FRANK. FRANCIS, I REALLY FEEL TERRIBLE DISTURBING YOU LIKE THIS. I FEEL TERRIBLE DISTURBING YOU LIKE THIS, FRANCIS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, PHIL? IT'S FAY. - WHAT ABOUT FAY? - SHE'S BEEN ARRESTED. WHAT? I HAD A CALL FROM A DETECTIVE WALSH AT THE POLK AVENUE PRECINCT. SHE'S RAISING HELL DOWN THERE, AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION. OH, WONDERFULNESS. A MURDER? IT MIGHT JUST COME TO THAT. WELL, THEN LET'S HOPE FOR THE BEST... MAYBE MANSLAUGHTER. ANY CHANCE OF KEEPING THAT TUB FULL? BEFORE WE GOT OUR RESPECTIVE DIVORCES, I USED TO TELL MYSELF THAT THE SIGHT OF YOU PULLING ON YOUR SOCKS... AND RUSHING OFF INTO THE NIGHT DIDN'T BOTHER ME. I TOLD MYSELF THAT I UNDERSTOOD. I THOUGHT THAT WHEN THE DUST SETTLED, THERE'D BE MORE TIME FOR US TO, UH, EXPLORE EACH OTHER, AND MAYBE FIND OUT OR FIGURE OUT IF WE WERE CAPABLE OF SOMETHING MORE... THAN JUST AN EXTRAMARITAL GAME OF BUMP AND TICKLE. MAYBE I CAN COME BACK. DON'T PROMISE WHAT YOU CAN'T DELIVER, FRANK. IS THIS IT? IS THIS THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR? IT'S A TWO-WAY STREET, KIDDO. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HOURS TO SPARE? DETECTIVE WALSH, SHIELD NUMBER 1974, INDELIBLY BURNED INTO MY BRAIN. YOUR BEHIND IS GONNA BE IN A SLING, MISTER, WHEN MY HUSBAND GETS HERE. HE'S HERE, MA'AM. YOU CAN GO NOW. WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME. WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? I JUST GOT THE CALL FROM PHIL ESTERHAUS. I DON'T HAVE TO ASK WHERE YOU'VE BEEN. I WAS ENJOYING THE AIR IN A FRIEND'S HOT TUB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WHEN THIS S.S. MAN, IN A TOTALLY UNWARRANTED RAID, INVADED OUR PRIVACY! I THINK AT THE VERY LEAST WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS FALSE ARREST, POLICE BRUTALITY. FAY, PLEASE, LET'S JUST GO. WE WERE INVESTIGATING A NEIGHBOR'S COMPLAINT, SIR. FRANK, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SUBJECTED TO A CAVITY SEARCH? A QUANTITY OF MARIJUANA WAS SEIZED ON THE SCENE, SIR. WELL, IT WASN'T MINE! I DON'T USE DRUGS! FAY, LET'S GO. CAPTAIN, I'M SORRY. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU ASK NEXT TIME, YOU BOZO! FAY, SHUT UP! THANK YOU, WALSH. DON'T WORRY, YOU WERE JUST DOING YOUR JOB. NEVER... NEVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE... HAVE I EVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT! I AM GONNA SUE THIS DEPARTMENT'S CHEEKS OFF! HOW DARE THEY! WHO DO THEY THINK I AM, JUST SOME SORT OF A COMMON... I WAS SO SCARED. I KNOW. I KNOW. IT'S OKAY. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE ANYWAY? I TOLD YOU. YOU WERE ALL IN THERE... NAKED? NO, I WAS WEARING A WET SUIT. OF COURSE, WE WERE NAKED. WHO WERE THEY? FRIENDS OF HARVEY'S. WHERE WAS... WHAT'S HIS NAME... HARVEY? AT A PSYCHIATRIC CONVENTION IN CALIFORNIA. HE'S VERY CONSERVATIVE ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS, FRANK. WHEN HE FINDS OUT... HE DOESN'T HAVE TO FIND OUT. I WAS BOOKED. YOU CAN BE UNBOOKED. I CAN? FIRST, WE HAVE TO TALK. ABOUT WHAT? THE LETTER FROM THE LAWYER. THAT'S BLACKMAIL. NO ONE'S TRYING TO BLACKMAIL ANYONE. I JUST WANT TO TALK... YOU AND ME. FAY, WE'RE ADULTS. WE ONCE LOVED EACH OTHER VERY MUCH. WE STILL SHARE A LOVE FOR OUR SON. THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULD BEAT EACH OTHER UP WITH THREATS. FOR ONCE SINCE THE DIVORCE, I JUST WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TALK, WORK OUT SOMETHING WE CAN BOTH LIVE WITH. WHAT DO YOU SAY? OKAY. I'D LIKE THAT, FRANK. COME ON. I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME. ARE YOU SURE I WON'T BE CHARGED? IT'S ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY NOT SO BAD, FRANK. OH, GOD. WHAT A NIGHT. HOW MANY FRIENDS OF YOURS WERE IN THAT HOT TUB? WHAT ARE YOU, AN ACCOUNTANT? I'M CONCERNED, THAT'S ALL. OH. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING, I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU. YOU DO, HUH? YOU KNOW, I HAD AN EROTIC DREAM ABOUT YOU THE OTHER NIGHT.
