Y'ALL GOT THAT HUNT-AND-PECK METHOD DOWN PRETTY GOOD, DON'T YA? WHY DON'T YOU LET ME TYPE? WE'LL BE DONE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. SUIT YOURSELF. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? ME. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. CASEY? TELL THE CAPTAIN WE'RE HERE. HOBAN. EDDIE. SAME PLACE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES, RIGHT? I, UH... UH... ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WAS... IT WAS... BANG. AND THEN... THEN IT WAS OVER. IT WAS, UH... UH... IT WAS OVER BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT... YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND, YOU SEE, UH... LIKE IT... AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, UM... IT'S OKAY, EDDIE. TAKE YOUR TIME. THEY WERE, UH... THEY WERE THERE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES, RIGHT? IT'S OVER, BOBBY. YEAH, IT'S OVER. BUT YOU KNOW, CAPTAIN, I THINK EDDIE HOBAN'S CONFESSED TO A CRIME... HE DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER DOIN'. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I MAY NOT SLEEP AT NIGHT. THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU. BUT WHAT I FOUND THERE WAS HARDLY WHAT I'D EXPECTED. THIS PRECINCT'S CAPTAIN IS A SOFT-SPOKEN... BUT UNMISTAKABLY TOUGH VETERAN OF 17 YEARS OF POLICE WORK, THE LAST TWO YEARS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE HILL. WHAT TWO YEARS ON THE HILL BOILS DOWN TO STATISTICALLY... IS 482 HOMICIDES AND LITERALLY THOUSANDS... OF FELONY ROBBERIES, ASSAULTS, RAPE/ASSAULTS, AND MORE CASUAL VIOLENCE IN AN AFTERNOON... THAN MOST OF US WILL EXPERIENCE IN A LIFETIME. THE JOB OF THE 238 MEN AND WOMEN OF HILL STREET... IS PRIMARILY TO KEEP THE LID ON. ONE'S SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG, GOOD OR BAD, JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE... ALL THESE NOTIONS TAKE A BACKSEAT TO SIMPLE SURVIVAL... FROM WHAT'S OUT THERE ON THE STREETS. HERE'S SOME OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE. HERE ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE. THE DRIVER IS OFFICER RENKO. SWEETIE. HIS PARTNER... OFFICER HILL. WE ROLLED EARLY THAT MORNING... THANKS FOR MEETING ME. THANK YOU. YOU'RE A FAMOUS GUY, PIZZA MAN. BARTENDER, A CLUB SODA FOR MY NEPHEW. IS SHE KILLING US? SURPRISINGLY NOT. THIS FOOTAGE WAS SHOT WHILE ON PATROL... WITH TWO YOUNG HILL STREET OFFICERS NAMED HARRIS AND SANTINI. FIVE DAYS LATER, OFFICER HARRIS WOULD DIE... DURING A ROUTINE INVESTIGATION OF ROBBERY SUSPECTS. A MERE WEEK AFTER HIS PARTNER'S DEATH, OFFICER SANTINI WOULD RESIGN FROM THE FORCE. THE PHYSICAL TOLL OF SUCH RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE... IS A SIMPLE MATTER OF STATISTICS. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS UPON THE OFFICERS WHO MUST RETURN DAILY... SHE'S GOING PLACES, FRANK. THIS IS GOOD STUFF. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. NOT TO MENTION THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF CRIMINAL SUSPECTS... THAT STRAIN ITS FACILITIES 24 HOURS A DAY. FAR FROM OFFERING A RESPITE TO ITS OFFICERS, HILL STREET STATION LITERALLY ASSAULTS THEM... WITH A HARSH, UNTEMPERED FOCUSING OF THE VIOLENCE AND DESPAIR... THAT FLOURISHES JUST OUTSIDE ITS WALLS. WHEN VIEWED FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE SIEGE MENTALITY... AND SEVERE EMOTIONAL STRESS APPARENT IN SO MANY OF ITS OFFICERS. YEAH, PHIL. BAD SITUATION, FRANCIS. THE DEKKER AVENUE PEOPLE TRIED MIXING IT UP WITH THE GYPSY BOYS. - WHAT HAPPENED? - YOU HAVE ONE DEAD MERCHANT. MARONE! COULD I TROUBLE YOU AGAIN PLEASE? THANK YOU. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS ONE. ONE OF YOUR DEKKER AVENUE MERCHANTS WAS KILLED. THEY INTERRUPTED WITH A NEWS BULLETIN. DRUG USE IS RAMPANT, AS IS PROSTITUTION, JUVENILE-GANG WARFARE AND THE TERRIBLE CAUSES OF IT ALL... CAUSES WHICH ARE ALL TOO EASILY CITED ON A JOURNALISTIC LEVEL. HOW ARE YOU, HECTOR? SURVIVIN', BRO. HOW ABOUT YOU? UH, NOT SO GOOD. YOU WANNA SIT DOWN? WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE PLACING YOU. THEY HAVE WAITING LISTS. YOU KNOW THAT. AND LIMITED FUNDING AND... I GOTTA BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU. YOUR RECORD SCARES 'EM OFF. THEY THINK I'M A SCARY DUDE NOW? WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN', FRANK. YOU TELL 'EM THEY AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET. ALL RIGHT? NOTHIN'. YOU LISTEN UP, YOUNG MAN. YOU MAY BE A MINOR LEGALLY, BUT YOU'RE A MAJOR-LEAGUE OFFENDER WHO HAS SHOWN... ABSOLUTELY NO INCLINATION WHATSOEVER TO CHANGE. NOW I AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE, INCLUDING MS. DAVENPORT, HAVE BUSTED THEIR HUMPS ON YOUR BEHALF. - AND I WANT SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE. - WHAT? SIX MONTHS. SIX LOUSY MONTHS, MAN, WITHOUT YOU GETTING INTO ANY BEEFS... AND WITHOUT ALIENATING EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO HELP YOU. SIX MONTHS HERE OR WHEREVER ELSE THEY SEND YOU... WITHOUT RUNNING AWAY AND STICKING UP SOME SUPERMARKET. THEN MAYBE... MAYBE WE GOT A SHOT. COME ON, FRANK. THOSE PLACES DON'T WANT ME, MAN. THEY'RE LOOKIN' FOR SOME LITTLE NOTHIN' WHO THINKS THAT, UH... THAT SPITTIN' IN THE SUBWAY'S A BIG DEAL. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, HECTOR? YOU MAY BE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BUT HOW IN THE HELL ARE WE GOING TO FIND THAT OUT UNLESS YOU MEET ME HALFWAY, HMM? IT'S THIS PLACE, MAN. IF I CAN ONLY GET OUTTA HERE, YOU KNOW? YOU PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THERE. I DO KNOW. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY IN IT IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF IT. SIX MONTHS, HECTOR. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I AIN'T MAKIN' NO PROMISES. BUT, UH... I'LL GIVE IT A TRY. ALL RIGHT, FRANK? I'LL TRY. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
