IT SAYS SO RIGHT THERE. AND IF I SAW HIM, HE WAS THERE, AND IF HE WAS THERE, YOU SAW HIM. IPSO FACTO. PULL OVER THERE. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD ON NOW.

WITHIN A QUARTER OF THE ORIGINAL CONSIGNMENT, THEN HE'S ENTITLED TO UNOBSTRUCTED EASEMENT. HEY, MAN. NOW, YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT, MAN. BEING THE RESPONDENT TO THE SECOND PART... MEANS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ACCEDE TO SOME OF THE FIDUCIARY ENCUMBRANCES INVOLVED HERE. NOW, YOU OWN A GARAGE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIX THE MAN'S TRUCK AND BE DONE WITH IT? IT COULD EARN YOU A LOT OF GOODWILL. GOOD WHAT? MAN, LISTEN, I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT HIS GOODWILL! I'M NOT TALKIN' ABOUT HIS GOODWILL, BROTHER. I'M TALKIN' ABOUT MY OWN. SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST, UH, THINK ABOUT THAT, OKAY? SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS TRUCK? IT NEEDS A RADIATOR.

LET'S GET OUTTA HERE. RENKO! WATCH OUT! KEEP THAT TRAFFIC MOVING. KEEP THAT TRAFFIC MOVING. STAND BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU'RE NOT HELPING THE SITUATION BY BEING IN THE WAY. PLEASE LEAVE THE AREA. TALK TO ME. OKAY. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THE BUTCHER AND HIS APPRENTICE ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE... IN A MEAT LOCKER BY A COUPLE OF KIDS. INJURIES? UH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW. LATER, PLEASE. ONE OF THE SUSPECTS IS... HEY, COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. EXCUSE ME, SIR. ONE OF THE SUSPECTS IS HECTOR RUIZ. HECTOR? WE JUST GOT WORD HE ESCAPED FROM THE YOUTH AUTHORITY. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S JUST YOUR BASIC EVASIVE ACTION. SEE, THIS KID TOOK A SHOT AT US. WE HAVE AN A.P.B. OUT ON HIM. HOW DO I TALK TO HECTOR? THERE'S A PHONE IN THE FREEZER, BUT IT HASN'T WORKED IN YEARS. WHO ARE YOU? IRV KRESKY, MARKET MANAGER. HOW DO YOU DO? STAY CLOSE. I MAY NEED YOU. WILL YOU MOVE THAT CAR! ANYBODY TALK TO HIS MOTHER? LUCY BATES IS TRYING TO FIND HER, I THINK. MARV, HOW'S IT COMING? I GOT ONE LAST CONNECTION TO MAKE. OKAY. THERE. THIS RECEIVER'S HOOKED UP TO THE ONE IN THE MEAT LOCKER, THE WHOLE CONNECTION TIES INTO THE STOREWIDE P.A. SYSTEM, AND THIS HERE'S YOUR KILL BUTTON IN CASE YOU WANT TO TALK PRIVATELY. LET'S KEEP IT ON THE P.A. SYSTEM FOR NOW. HOW DO I GET THROUGH? YOU JUST PUSH THIS BUTTON, AND IT'LL RING IN THE MEAT LOCKER. YOU'RE A WIZARD, MARV. YEP. ANYBODY GOT ANY ANTACIDS? TRY HALFWAY DOWN THE AISLE TO THE LEFT. MARV, YOU OKAY? I'M TELLIN' YOU THE TRUTH, HENRY. I AM A MESS. WE HAVE A CAR COMING THROUGH HERE. WE HAVE A CAR COMING THROUGH. YEAH, WHAT IS IT? HECTOR, IT'S ME... FRANK FURILLO. FURILLO, MAN, WHERE'VE YOU BEEN, HUH? I GOT HERE AS QUICKLY AS I COULD. LET'S GET THIS THING OVER WITH FAST... BEFORE THINGS GET TOO OUT OF HAND, OKAY? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WANT $100,000 AND A PLANE TO CUBA. I CAN'T STAY HERE NO MORE, FRANK. I CAN'T, MAN. HECTOR, THAT'S NO ANSWER. YEAH, WELL, NEITHER IS JUVENILE HALL, MAN. THAT PLACE IS NOWHERE. THEY'LL BE BUSTIN' MY CHOPS ALL THE TIME FOR NOTHIN', MAN. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT GOT ME KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL, FRANK. I'M NOT LYIN' TO YOU. - DID YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE? - ABOUT AS MUCH AS THEY GAVE ME, MAN. LOOK, THEY LOCKED ME IN A ROOM FOR ONE WEEK JUST 'CAUSE I COPPED ONE LOUSY CIGARETTE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT, MAN? THEY HAD ALL THEIR CHANCES, FRANK. ALL RIGHT. JUST TAKE IT EASY, WILL YOU? UM, ANYBODY HURT OR WOUNDED IN THERE? NOT YET, MAN, BUT WE GOT SOME WORDS TO SAY, LIKE TURNIN' THIS ICEBOX OFF BEFORE I FREEZE MY TAIL, MAN. OKAY. I'LL TELL... CAPTAIN! CAPTAIN! UH, JUST ONE SECOND, OKAY, HECTOR? CAPTAIN, THERE'S ALMOST 20,000 DOLLARS' WORTH OF CHOICE BEEF IN THERE. TO HELL WITH THAT! I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE IN THERE! SO AM I. BUT WE WORK ON A ONE-PERCENT MARKUP HERE. AND BETWEEN THE SHOPLIFTINGS AND THE MUGGINGS, THIS PARTICULAR CHUCKY'S IS CONSIDERED MARGINAL AT BEST. FRANKIE, ARE YOU THERE? CAN YOU HEAR ME, MAN? JUST ONE MORE SECOND, OKAY, HECTOR? MAYBE WE COULD SEND IN SOME COATS. FOOD TOO, FRANK. FOOD IS VERY PRIMAL. IF WE CAN GET 'EM TO ACCEPT NOURISHMENT FROM US, IT'LL BE A REAL STEP IN ESTABLISHING RAPPORT. - OH, GOOD. GO AHEAD. - WHERE'S THE DELI SECTION? THIS WAY. HECTOR, WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE TURNING OFF THE FREEZER UNIT, BUT WE'RE GONNA SEND IN SOME HOT FOOD AND CLOTHES, ALL RIGHT? DON'T JERK ME AROUND, FRANK, OR I'LL BLOW THESE SUCKERS AWAY NOW. YOU DIG? NO ONE'S JERKING YOU AROUND, HECTOR. JUST TAKE IT EASY. ALL RIGHT. YOU SEND SOME CLOTHES AND SOME FOOD, AND THEN MAYBE WE RAP, ALL RIGHT, FRANK? HAZLICK, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT .7. LET'S SEE HERE. I THINK WE SHOULD PUT IT DOWN HERE BY THE CANNED FRUIT. UH, NO, NO. WAIT A... HOLD IT WITH THAT THING. WELL, WELL, WELL. FRANK, IT'S DÃ‰JÃ€ VU. SO MUCH FOR REHABILITATION, HUH? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT, HOWARD? THAT IS A SOYET 109 INCENDIARY ROCKET LAUNCHER. IT'S RUSSIAN-MADE. AND ALL THE RIOT GEAR IS ON LOAN FROM THE STOCKHOLM POLICE. - WHAT DO YOU THINK, FRANK? - LOSE IT. JUDAS PRIEST, FRANK. THAT'S AN EIGHT-INCH STEEL DOOR. IF THOSE DEVIATES DON'T THINK WE MEAN BUSINESS, THEN OUR ACE IN THE HOLE ISN'T WORTH A BROWN Q-TIP. WHAT ACE IN THE HOLE? THE PLASTIQUE CHARGES ON THE OUTER WALLS. HOWARD, THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN THAT MEAT LOCKER, SO TAKE A COMMAND. NO SOYETS, NO PLASTIQUE. JUST SECURE THE SCENE. PERIOD. THE ONLY SECURE SCENE IS A NEUTRALIZED SCENE, FRANK. OF COURSE, IF THAT MAKES YOUR PALMS DAMP, THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TO GO. WHAT MIGHT THAT BE? HYPOTHERMIA. IT'S A WELL-KNOWN MEDICAL FACT THAT YOUR LATIN TYPES CAN'T TAKE THE COLD. SAUNDERS, YOU TAKE THE HIGH GROUND. LUKENS, YOU TAKE THE RIGHT FLANK. WHAT WE'LL DO IS BYPASS THE MAIN CIRCUIT REGULATOR... AND HOOK UP AN AUXILIARY COMPRESSOR TO THAT FREEZER UNIT... AND DROP THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN THERE TO 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. THEIR BODY TEMPERATURES DROP, THEY BECOME DISORIENTED, THEN DROWSINESS SETS IN, THEN SLEEP, THEN... THEN A SLOW, PAINLESS DEATH. IS THAT RIGHT, HOWARD? WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, FRANK. MY STRATEGY WAS TO WALTZ IN THERE BEFORE THAT POINT AND CARRY 'EM OUT. ACTUALLY, IT'S QUITE HUMANE AND CONSERVATIVE, AS THIS HYPOTHERMIC TIMETABLE CLEARLY SHOWS. HEY, FURILLO, ARE YOU OUT THERE, MAN? IT'S YOUR SHOW, GUY, BUT I'D HATE TO TRY AND EXPLAIN TWO SHOTGUNNED HOSTAGES... TO A BOARD OF INQUIRY, MUCH LESS THEIR FAMILIES. HECTOR, I... WHAT DO YOU SAY, FRANK? I CAN'T TAKE 'EM DOWN ANY CLEANER THAN THAT. WHO SAID THAT? HUH? AIN'T NOBODY GONNA TAKE US DOWN, FRANK. NOBODY! HECTOR... HECTOR, LISTEN. THAT WAS GREAT, HOWARD. JUST GREAT. OH, YOU CAN'T CODDLE THESE TYPES, FRANK. WE EITHER TAKE 'EM OUTTA HERE, OR WE ALL MAY AS WELL START SPEAKIN' "ESPANOLE." OKAY, SET IT UP. BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO IMPLEMENT ANYTHING, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WITHOUT MY EXPRESS ORDER. WHATEVER YOU SAY, FRANK. BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT KID IN THERE AIN'T EXACTLY BEAVER CLEAVER. IF YOU GET MY DRIFT. ALL RIGHT, COME ON, MEN. I DON'T KNOW. MY STOMACH'S BEEN KILLING ME. I GOT A TERRIBLE HEADACHE. I THOUGHT I HAD A HOT GALL BLADDER OR SOMETHING, BUT MY INTERNIST SAYS NO. DON'T POOH-POOH IT, MARV. HENRY, I CAN'T "POO-POO" ANYTHING. I'M SERIOUS. EVEN THE CONSERVATIVE ESTABLISHMENT... IS BEGINNING TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE, THE HOLISTIC APPROACH. NO, NO. I'M TELLING YOU. I KNOW MY OWN BODY. IT'S EITHER GONNA BE THE GALL BLADDER... OR MAYBE SOME STONES. WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S A HELL OF A THING... YOU CAN'T EVEN KEEP DOWN A LOUSY SLICE OF TURKEY. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT YOU OLD TESTAMENT TYPES KNEW HOW TO MAKE A DECENT SANDWICH. RENKO, MY MOTHER SAID EAT. SHE NEVER SAID WATCH. HONESTLY, HECTOR, I THINK YOU SIMPLY MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT LT. HUNTER WAS TRYING TO SAY. UH, LOOK, WE'RE GONNA SEND IN THE FOOD AND CLOTHES NOW. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, BUT MAKE IT QUICK, FURILLO. QUICK, ALL RIGHT? FRANK, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO BE THE ONE TO TAKE IT IN. SURE, HENRY. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP. I WANT ALL GUNS DOWN NOW. THAT'S AN ORDER! RIGHT. EVERYBODY, GUNS DOWN! DO YOU HEAR ME, HECTOR? DETECTIVE GOLDBLUME WILL NOW APPROACH YOU. HE IS UNARMED. WE HAVE A TRUCK COMING THROUGH. TRUCK COMING THROUGH. WE GOT AN AMBULANCE HERE. WE GOT AN AMBULANCE. I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED, SON. WE ALL ARE. IT'S A SCARY SITUATION. BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER ON THIS, NOBODY HAS TO GET HURT. OKAY? GIVE 'EM SOME, MAN. HERE. GIVE 'EM ONE. I THINK I MADE CONTACT, FRANK. REAL CONTACT. WHAT CONTACT? THAT KID DOESN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF ENGLISH. THAT MAY NOT REALLY MATTER, ANDREW. THANK YOU FOR HELPING OUT YOUR POLICE FORCE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING OUT YOUR POLICE FORCE. CAN YOU JUST MOVE BACK A LITTLE MORE? OH, COME ON, HECTOR. A PLANE TO CUBA'S A LOT OF BEAN DIP, AND YOU KNOW IT! EVEN IF I COULD ARRANGE IT, WHICH I DOUBT, THEY'D ONLY SEND YOU BACK, AND THEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE F.B.I. AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU, MAN, THOSE GUYS DON'T TAKE KINDLY TO HIJACKERS. NOW, LISTEN, HECTOR. THERE'S SOMEONE HERE WHO REALLY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. DON'T HANG UP NOW. I WANT YOU TO TALK TO HER. OKAY, FRANK. HECTOR, YOU COME OUTTA THERE RIGHT NOW! AND DON'T GIVE THESE PEOPLE NO MORE TROUBLE! MAN, WHY'D YOU GOTTA BRING HER HERE FOR, FRANK? TROUBLE! ALWAYS WITH YOU IT'S TROUBLE. AND NOW I'M GONNA LOSE MY JOB BECAUSE OF YOU. I'M GONNA SEND YOU BACK TO THE JUVENILE AUTHORITY! NO WAY, MAN. I SAID I WASN'T GOING BACK THERE, FRANK. YOU GOT NO RIGHT, MAN. IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS! NOW, WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO TELL HER, HUH? - HECTOR, LISTEN TO ME. - NO, I'M NEVER GONNA LISTEN TO YOU AGAIN, FRANK. YOU GOT NO RIGHT, MAN. IT AIN'T NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. JUST 'CAUSE I TAKE SOME DAMN HOSTAGES? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT SO BAD, FRANK, HUH? YOU WANT A HOSTAGE SO BAD? WELL, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE RIGHT NOW, FRANK. - NO, HECTOR. WAIT. DON'T. - LISTEN TO ME. RENKO! ANDY! EASY. EASY. NOBODY FIRES! DON'T SHOOT AND DON'T MOVE! I WANT THE PARAMEDICS IN HERE FAST! HECTOR, I GOT 20 MEN OUT HERE WITH GUNS. I WANT THAT SHOOTING VICTIM OUT HERE RIGHT NOW, OR THEY'RE COMING IN. COME ON! HURRY UP! YES, YES. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE HOSTAGES. YES, YES. ALL WE REALLY KNOW... IS THAT THE PERPETRATORS SHOT UP A SIDE OF BEEF. I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF CHUCKY'S SHOP 'N SAVE ON VAN BUREN AVENUE. ONLY MOMENTS AGO, SHOTS WERE FIRED. MR. KRESKY, YOU WERE INSIDE. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, WE HAVE TWO PUERTO RICAN TEENAGERS... HOLDING OUR BUTCHER AND HIS APPRENTICE HOSTAGE IN THE, UH, MEAT LOCKER. WAS ANYONE INJURED IN THE EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE? UH, WELL, IT WASN'T EXACTLY AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE. THEY, UH... THEY SHOT UP SOME MEAT. I SEE. MR. KRESKY, HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU SAY... THAT CHUCKY'S SHOP 'N SAVE HAS BEEN ROBBED IN THE PAST YEAR? THERE HAVE BEEN SIX ROBBERIES AND THREE FAILED ATTEMPTS BEFORE TODAY, CYNTHIA. CAN CHUCKY'S CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS? THAT'S HARD TO SAY, BUT, UH, MINDFUL AS WE ARE OF OUR COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY, I THINK THAT BUSINESS AS USUAL IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. IN OTHER WORDS, CHUCKY'S MAY NOT REOPEN ITS DOORS? THAT IS CORRECT. YES. THE FULL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT... OF THIS CRIME IN PROGRESS IS YET TO BE DETERMINED. AS OF NOW, HOWEVER, IT DOES LOOK AS IF AN ALREADY BELEAGUERED COMMUNITY... IS IN FOR AN EVEN TOUGHER GO OF IT. THIS IS CYNTHIA CHASE, ACTION NEWS, CHANNEL 6. WHAT'S THAT? WE'RE USING A GL700 DELUXE MOBILE FROST KING, FRANK. IT HAS DUAL FROST PUMPS AND DIRECT POWER ACCESS. IT SUCKS UP THERMAL B.T.U.'s FASTER THAN AN ELEPHANT IN HEAT. I WISH I FELT BETTER ABOUT THIS. AFTER WHAT THAT LITTLE SOCIOPATH DID? TRUST ME, FRANK, WHEN I GET THROUGH WITH HIM, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO JAM A STICK UP HIS NOSE AND PASS HIM OFF AS A FUDGSICLE. GRADUAL, HOWARD. NO MORE THAN 10 DEGREES PER HOUR, TOPS. I'M IN NO RUSH HERE. YO, FURILLO, ARE YOU THERE? YEAH, RIGHT HERE, HECTOR. LOOK, UM, JUAN HERE... JUAN DON'T FEEL TOO GOOD, MAN. SO IF I SEND HIM OUT, YOU SWEAR NOTHIN' BAD GONNA COME DOWN ON HIM... LIKE, UH, NO WORK FARM AND NO JUVENILE HALL OR NOTHIN' LIKE THAT? I CAN'T PROMISE THAT, HECTOR. BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SEND A HOSTAGE OUT WITH HIM, I'D HAVE A LOT MORE TO WORK WITH THAN I HAVE NOW. ALL RIGHT. BUT FIRST I WANNA TALK TO THE MEDIA. YOU GOT THAT? UH, I THINK WE COULD COME THAT FAR, HECTOR. IT SOUNDS FAIR TO ME. JUST HOLD ONE MINUTE. ALL RIGHT. RENKO, WHO HAVE WE GOT OUT THERE? - CYNTHIA CHASE. - ALL RIGHT. SEND HER IN. UH, CAPTAIN, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THE DECEASED? TAG IT FOR EVIDENCE AND GET IT OUT OF HERE. - THE WHOLE THING? - WOULD YOU GET ME CYNTHIA CHASE? YES, SIR. EXCUSE ME. HECTOR, THE TELEVISION PEOPLE WILL BE HERE IN ONE MINUTE. BACK.

I'M FINE, HECTOR, BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE THE HOSTAGES? THE HOSTAGES ARE GREAT. JUST GREAT. - AND HOW ARE YOU, EMOTIONALLY? - OH, I AIN'T WORRIED. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY HOLD OUT IN THERE? WHO KNOWS. THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD IN HERE. HECTOR, CAN YOU TELL OUR VIEWERS WHY YOU SEIZED THIS MARKET? HEY, THEY CHASED US IN HERE, LADY. ARE YOU A MEMBER OF THE PUERTO RICAN NATIONAL FRONT, OR IS THIS SEIZURE OF CHUCKY'S A PURELY INDEPENDENT PROTEST? WELL, WHY NOT, MAN? ALL I GOTTA DO IS CUT OUT THE PIECE AS EVIDENCE, AND THEY CAN'T LEGALLY SELL IT. THIS IS WOUNDED MEAT, BOBBY, AND A RIGHTEOUS SIN TO WASTE. ALL THEY'LL DO IS TAKE IT DOWN TO THE STATION. IT'LL GET ALL HOT, AND IT WON'T BE WORTH... FIT FOR DOG MEAT. YEAH, NEITHER WILL WE IF FURILLO FINDS OUT ABOUT IT EITHER. SHH. LOOK, CAN I HELP IT IF SOMEBODY BROUGHT THIS MEAT DOWN AND PUT IT AT MY FEET? THAT'S FATE, MAN. I DON'T MESS WITH FATE, NOT AT $2.29 A POUND. OKAY, IF WE'RE GONNA DO IT, SON, WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT RIGHT. HOW ARE WE GONNA GET THIS THING OUT OF HERE, COWBOY? OUR UNIT'S TEMPORARILY INDISPOSED. REMEMBER? FEAR NOT. WOULD YOU CALL THIS A PROTEST AGAINST ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION, IN THE FACT THAT IF THIS MARKET DOES CLOSE, IT WILL CAUSE SUCH A HARDSHIP TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY? SURE. WHY NOT.
