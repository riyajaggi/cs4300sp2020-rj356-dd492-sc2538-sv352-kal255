THANK YOU. I FIND MYSELF CHARGED WITH MAKING A DIFFICULT AND DISTRESSING ANNOUNCEMENT. YES, THE SCUTTLEBUTT IS MORE OR LESS ACCURATE. CAPTAIN FURILLO IS A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR A PROMOTION TO COMMANDERSHIP AT DIVISION. AS A PERSONAL OBSERVATION, I THINK HE'S THE ABLER MAN FOR THE JOB. SO WHAT SAY WE GIRD OUR LOINS FOR THE WORST. SUCH IS LIFE. SUCH IS POLICE WORK. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT. HEY, STAY WARM. AND, UH... LET'S BE CAREFUL OUT THERE, HUH? SEE A DOCTOR, WOULD YA, PLEASE? HOMEOPATH... TAKE SOMETHING. YOU GOT ANYTHING?

YEAH, YOU DO THAT. THANK YOU. HE'S PLAYING RACQUETBALL. OH, NICE! FRANK, FRANK JR. WAS LISTENING ON THE OTHER PHONE... WHILE THAT PERVERT WAS SPEWING THAT TWISTED FILTH AT ME. LORD KNOWS WHAT AN EFFECT IT'S GONNA HAVE ON HIS EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WELL, HE WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD ANYTHING, FAY, IF YOU HAD HUNG UP. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HANG UP? BECAUSE YOUR RACQUETBALL-PLAYING COLLEAGUE, THE MENTALLY DEFICIENT CAPTAIN ECKER OF THE MIDTOWN PRECINCT, TOLD ME NOT TO. HE SAID, "WE HAVE TRACING TECHNIQUES, MRS. FURILLO." LIKE HELL THEY DO. JUST TAKE IT EASY. WHERE'S FRANK JR. NOW? I WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH HIM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. HARVEY IS TAKING CARE OF IT. WELL, HE IS A PROFESSIONAL, AFTER ALL. OH, GREAT, FAY.

YOU FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION, MICK, OR ELSE. YEAH, HILL STREET. I SAID I'LL TRY. JUST A SECOND. LIEUTENANT? IT'S THE CAPTAIN. LINE THREE. GO AHEAD, FRANK. FRANK? FRANK. WHERE THE HELL IS MARV? NOTHING WORKS IN THIS PLACE. NO FURNACE, NO PHONE, NO NOTHING! I'LL GET HIM, OKAY? I'LL GET HIM. THEY'RE RAISIN' HELL UPSTAIRS, MARV. THERE'S ONLY TWO PHONES WORKIN' IN THE ENTIRE JOINT... FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD. MARV, ARE YOU SLEEPING? REAL CUTE, MARV. WANT TO STOP SCREWIN' AROUND? MARV... OH, MY... HOW YA DOIN', ABE? HELLO, EMIL. FRANK. HE'S IN ROOM "D," CAPTAIN. WOULD THE DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO D.A. KILEY'S OFFICE... PLEASE PICK UP A MESSAGE AT THE FRONT DESK? CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE HINT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? ALL I KNOW IS THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SAID URGENT. URGENT, HUH? WELL, IN CASE YOU HADN'T HEARD, THEY'VE KICKED THIS NEMO RODRIGUEZ THING UPSTAIRS. YOU KNOW WHO'S IN THERE WITH HIM NOW? THE FEMALE BARRACUDA... DAVENPORT. NOW I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU, FRANK, BUT I'M BLAMING YOU... FOR THIS SCREWING AROUND WASTING OF MY TIME. AND I'M TELLIN' YOU SOMETHING ELSE, KID, YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT, IF YOU HADN'T BEEN HUMPING FOR COMMANDER. OH, WELL. POLITICS IS POLITICS, HMM? I JUST HATE TO SEE A GOOD GUY SINKIN' IN THAT SWAMP. WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE NOTHIN' AT THE HOUSE... SO I WENT OVER TO THIS AFTER-HOURS PLACE TO GO PICK UP A BOTTLE, RIGHT? OKAY. I COME BACK MAYBE 20 MINUTES LATER, AND I'M ON THE STAIRS WHEN I HEAR THE GUN GO OFF. I HEAR A CRASH TOO, AND THEN THIS GUY COMES TEARING OUT THE DOOR AND DOWN THE STAIRS. BAM! THROWS ME AGAINST THE WALL SO I DON'T HAVE NO CHANCE TO GRAB HIM. I MEAN, I DIDN'T HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL, RIGHT? BUT IT WAS HIM, MAN. SEE, NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE I MET HIM ONE TIME... WHEN I WENT OVER TO GO SEE ROSE IN A PLACE HE SET HER UP IN. TELL THE CAPTAIN AND LIEUTENANT THE MAN'S NAME. IT WAS McAURLEY, THE COUNCILMAN GUY. DON'T DO THIS, KID. YOU GOT A GREAT IMAGINATION, BUT... HIS PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE MURDER WEAPON. HE'S TOLD US TWO COCK-AND-BULL STORIES ALREADY. HE'S A VERY CREATIVE KID. COUNCILMAN McAURLEY. WHAT'S THIS? IT'S THE APARTMENT ADDRESS. I WOULDN'T THINK IT TOO DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN... IF THE VICTIM WAS BEING KEPT AND BY WHOM. I'D LIKE IT SEARCHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST. I CALLED HIS OFFICE. HE'S BEEN IN AND OUT ALL MORNING. THOUGHT I'D STOP BY ON THE WAY UPTOWN. LOOK, FRANK, I KNOW HOW TIGHT McAURLEY IS WITH THE DEPARTMENT, AND IF SCHNEIDER WON'T TALK TO HIM, I'LL JUST HAVE THE D.A. SUBPOENA HIM. NOW WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IF HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT? YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO IT'S GONNA BE ALL OVER THE NEWS. BESIDES THAT, SCHNEIDER HAS A POINT. THE KID HASN'T TOLD THE SAME STORY TWICE. DO YOU BELIEVE HIM? I DON'T KNOW YET. FRANK, I WANT TO SEE YOU MAKE COMMANDER, AND FOR MORE REASONS THAN JUST THE SHAPE OF YOUR NOSE. YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT, OKAY? I THINK WE'RE ASKING FOR IT IF WE DON'T GIVE IT A REST UNTIL THIS THING IS OVER. AND DON'T DO THAT. AND DON'T GIVE ME AN ARGUMENT. ALL WE NEED IS A RUMOR OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE P.D.'s OFFICE AND YOU. LET ME HAVE SKIP FITZGERALD SUBPOENA THE COUNCILMAN AND GET IT OVER WITH. NO, NO, NO. HOLD OFF ON THAT.

TWO SETS OF WANTS, NEEDS, DESIRES. TWO VERY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES. I MEAN, LYING AROUND STARK NAKED... WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHER NAKED PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES... PHIL, I'VE HAD A VERY BAD COUPLE OF DAYS. OH, FAY, DID I SAY SOMETHING? OH, FAY. OH. SEX, SEX, SEX... I'M SEXED TO THE TEETH! OH. OH. RAY, TELL FRANK I WANT TO SEE HIM. YOU TOO. OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU, EMIL, WE WAITED, BUT SINCE YOU DIDN'T PULL A WARRANT ON THAT APARTMENT, WE DID. IT WAS EITHER THAT OR HAVE McAURLEY SUBPOENAED BY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. HIS BEING SUBPOENAED ISN'T MY PROBLEM. THIS IS. THIS IS LOW, FRANK... REAL LOW. TELL HIM, RAY. THE APARTMENT HOUSE SUPERINTENDENT VERIFIES McAURLEY PAYS THE RENT. A SEARCH OF THE PREMISES DISCOVERED McAURLEY'S PHONE NUMBERS IN HER BOOK... AND SNAPSHOTS OF THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER. WE ALSO GOT DEPARTMENT STORE RECEIPTS FOR WOMEN'S CLOTHES... CHARGED TO McAURLEY'S ACCOUNT. AND... WE TURNED UP AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE VICTIM... WHO SAYS THAT ROSARIO RIVAS WAS McAURLEY'S SPECIAL LADY. WHAT'S GOING ON, EMIL? NO SQUEEZE, FRANK. IT TOOK US TILL TODAY TO VERIFY ALL THIS. YOU KNEW ABOUT IT DAYS AGO. LISTEN, FRANK. THAT KID KILLED THAT GIRL. WHATEVER ELSE SHE WAS INVOLVED WITH IS IMMATERIAL. HE DID IT, AND WE GOT HIM AND THAT'S IT. AND THAT'S IT. WHICH ADDS UP TO MURDER ONE FOR THE RODRIGUEZ KID. THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM, FRANK. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE YOURS EITHER. LET THE LADY PLEAD HIM WHATEVER WAY SHE WANTS TO. COME ON. I'VE SEEN HER WORK. SHE'LL PUT ON A DOG AND PONY SHOW FOR THE D.A. THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. CAPTAIN FURILLO'S OFFICE. SHE'LL BEG HIM DOWN TO MANSLAUGHTER. HE'LL WALK OUT AFTER THREE. I BET A THOUSAND BUCKS ON IT HERE AND NOW. YEAH? THEN WHY WON'T McAURLEY TALK TO ME, EMIL? WHAT'S HE HIDING FROM? FRANK, DAVENPORT. SHE SAYS IT'S URGENT. FURILLO. McAURLEY'S ON CHANNEL 6 RIGHT NOW, AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. SURE. RIGHT AWAY. TURN ON CHANNEL 6. TALK A LITTLE, IF YOU WOULD, ABOUT THE NATURE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, COUNCILMAN... HOW, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU AND MRS. McAURLEY CAME TO KNOW HER. DURING THE LAST CAMPAIGN, UH, EVE GOT TO KNOW ROSE QUITE WELL. EVE HAD, UH, VOLUNTEERED HER TIME... TO HELP US ESTABLISH A YOUTH CENTER DOWN HERE... AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE LIFE OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE... THAT AWAITS SO MANY OF THESE YOUNGSTERS. EVE RECOGNIZED A RARE INTELLIGENCE AND SENSITIVITY IN THE GIRL, AND SHE PREVAILED UPON ME TO HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HER LIFE. WE BECAME VERY CLOSE... ROSE AND MYSELF. EVE AND I FELT, AND STILL DO, THAT IT'S ONE THING TO TALK A GOOD GAME. WE DECIDED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART. SO YOU SEE, ROSE WAS REALLY LIKE FAMILY TO US. AND IT'S THE CRUELEST OF IRONIES... FOR THIS WONDERFUL YOUNG WOMAN... TO HAVE LEFT US. CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS CASE, COUNCILMAN? WELL, ALL I FEEL AT LIBERTY TO SAY... WITHOUT, UH, DAMAGING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S INVESTIGATION... IS THAT THERE IS A SUSPECT... IN CUSTODY AT THIS TIME... A YOUNG MAN WHO, UH, KNEW ROSE BEFORE. THANK YOU, COUNCILMAN AND MRS. THOMAS McAURLEY. MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES. SATISFIED, FRANK? THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU MEANT WELL, BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW. ENJOY THE PROMOTION. LET'S HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER SOMETIME, RAY. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH, EMIL. FRANCIS, WE CAN'T GET THE FURNACE TO TURN OFF, AND I CAN'T RAISE MAINTENANCE. TALK ABOUT BANKERS' HOURS. DID YOU KNOW THEY CLOSE DOWN AT 4:00? CALL A FURNACE COMPANY. PUT 'EM ON THE BOOKS AS AN INFORMANT. OH, THAT'S A VERY CREATIVE IDEA. YOU KNOW, SINCE THE WORD'S OUT THAT YOU MIGHT MOVE UP TO DIVISION, I HAVE A FEW REQUESTS FOR TRANSFER. HOW MANY? TWENTY-EIGHT UNIFORMS, 17 PLAINCLOTHES... AND ONE POSSIBLE RETIREMENT. BUT YOU SHOULDN'T IN ANY WAY LET THIS AFFECT YOUR DECISION. I'LL LOOK AT 'EM IN THE MORNING. GOOD NIGHT, PHIL. GOOD NIGHT, FRANCIS. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
