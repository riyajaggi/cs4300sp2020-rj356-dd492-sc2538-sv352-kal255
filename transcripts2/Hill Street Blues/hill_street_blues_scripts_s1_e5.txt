 THOSE OFFICERS PARTICIPATING IN OPERATION DUCKLING... WILL RECONVENE HERE IN ONE HALF HOUR. AND THOSE ON REGULAR PATROL, LET'S ROLL. ALL OF YOU, LET'S BE CAREFUL OUT THERE, HUH? DISPATCH. WE HAVE A 9-11. ARMED ROBBERY IN PROGRESS. SEE SURPLUS STORE, CORNER PEOPLE'S DRIVE, 124th STREET. MACAFEE'S DIRTY. HE'S GOTTA BE. BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I KNOW WHERE HE DOES HIS LAUNDRY. WE'VE HAD COPS ON CLOSE SURVEILLANCE 24 HOURS A DAY, AND HE DOESN'T GAMBLE, HE'S NOT A WOMANIZER, HE'S GOT NO DEBTS, HE'S NOT INTO THE SHYLOCKS. THE DUDE DOESN'T EVEN OWN HIS OWN CAR. BANK ACCOUNTS THEN? WE CHECKED THAT OUT YESTERDAY. HE'S GOT A JOINT CHECKING WITH THE WIFE. NOTHING HEAVY. AND A MODEST SAVINGS ACCOUNT. I EVEN CALLED IN A FAVOR FROM A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S INTO GARBOLOGY. WHAT? HE'S A GARBOLOGIST. A P.I. WHO SPECIALIZES IN TRASH ANALYSIS. HE WENT THROUGH MACAFEE'S GARBAGE AND DIDN'T FIND A THING. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE ASKING US TO BELIEVE THAT RALPH MACAFEE IS IMPORTANTLY ON THE TAKE, YET THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE OF WHAT HE DOES WITH IT. THE MAN DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. MISS DAVENPORT WAS KIND ENOUGH TO STEER OFFICER LaRUE'S CASE MY WAY, BUT I'M NO HOUDINI, GENTLEMEN. I CAN'T HELP THE MAN IF I HAVE NOTHING TO WORK WITH. MAYBE IF WE GET INTO HIS HOUSE... YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO GROUNDS FOR A WARRANT. BESIDES, WHAT'S THE POINT? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA FIND? REMBRANDTS ON THE WALLS? BRUCE. WHY DON'T YOU TRY FOR A DELAY? I CAN TALK TO SKIP FITZGERALD IN THE D.A.'s OFFICE. HE OWES ME ONE. I DON'T KNOW. J.D.'s PRETTY STRUNG OUT, MA'AM. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S SUCH A HOT IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE COME TO SOME KIND OF CONSENSUS WITH LaRUE... AND THEN GET BACK IN TOUCH WITH ME? I'M RUNNING LATE AS IT IS. JOYCE, EDUCATE THEM. NOTHING PERSONAL, YOU TWO. PLEASED WITH HIMSELF, ISN'T HE? IS HE THE BEST WE CAN DO? DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HIM. HE'S GOOD. AND LaRUE'S ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT I'D CALL A GLAMOUR CASE. STAY ON HIM, NEAL. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FROM THIS END. RIGHT. UH... MEET ME OUTSIDE MACAFEE'S HOUSE AT 11:00. WHAT COULD HURT? "ABSOLUTELY NO GROUNDS FOR A WARRANT." LaRUE MIGHT WANT TO PLEAD DIMINISHED CAPACITY. HE DRINKS. SUPPOSE HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE AT THE TIME. WE COULD WORK WITH AN APPROACH LIKE THAT. SOUNDS TRENDY ENOUGH. OLD SKIP FITZGERALD HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR THAT, DOES HE? I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE, FRANK. BUT AS LONG AS I AM... AT YOUR REQUEST, I MIGHT ADD... I SUGGEST YOU START BEING A LITTLE MORE REALISTIC ABOUT JOHN LaRUE'S FUTURE. I'VE GOT A REMINDER FOR YOU, COUNSELOR. JOHN LaRUE IS NOT JUST ONE OF YOUR INDIGENT TYPES. A FAST SHUFFLE WITH GOOD OLD SKIP FITZGERALD... YOU'VE GOT SOME INTERESTING PROBLEMS WITH PERSPECTIVE. A DEAL IS STRUCK, AND ON TO THE NEXT CASE. HE'S INNOCENT. SUFFICE IT TO SAY... HE'S ALSO A COP, A DAMN GOOD ONE. THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT JOHN LaRUE'S INNOCENCE OR GUILT. THE ISSUE IS HOW BEST TO PRESERVE WHAT IS ALREADY DANGEROUSLY TAINTED BACON. THERE IS FIRE IN THAT WOMAN. YEAH. I NOTICED THAT MYSELF. HILL STREET STATION. AH, HOLD ON. DO WE HAVE ANYONE WHO CAN SPEAK SPANISH? HEY, YOU, MISTER. CAN I HELP YOU? IT'S ME, HAIR BALL... BELKER. NO! HOLY SMOKES! BELKER, YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. LOOK AT THAT HAIRDO. WHAT'D YOU DO, BLOW THE HAIRS DRY? AND THAT FACE... SMOOTH AS BABY BUNS. COULD I ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION, LEO? YEAH. WOULD YOU LIKE A RUPTURED SPLEEN? AH... NO. OH, YES. THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING ENSEMBLE, MICK. UNDERSTATED ELEGANCE, WITH JUST THE MOST CAREFUL DASH OF COLOR IN THE TIE. - WELL THOUGHT OUT. - THANK YOU. OH, SINCE YOU'RE ASSIGNED TO OPERATION DUCKLING, I SUGGEST YOU HEAD FOR THE LOCKER ROOM WITH ALL DUE HASTE. OPERATION DUCKLING. ME? COULD I, UH... LOOK, SARGE, I GOT A DATE TONIGHT WITH A WOMAN. SHE'S PICKING ME UP AT 6:00. SHIFT ENDS AT 5:00. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? DON'T GIVE ME "THE SHIFT ENDS AT 5:00." THIS KIND OF UNDERCOVER OPERATION IS OVER WHEN IT'S OVER. AH, YES. THE VICISSITUDES OF POLICE WORK. BELKER, I EMPATHIZE. I NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE. I NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK ONE OF THESE THINGS. WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS RIDICULOUS. BOBBY, GO LIKE THIS. AH, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I JOINED THE POLICE FORCE FOR THIS? HEY! SOMEBODY WANNA GET A CROW BAR AND HELP ME GET OUT OF THIS? I CAN'T BREATHE. TAKE THIS. COWBOY, YOU BETTER COVER ME. OTHERWISE, YOUR BEHIND IS MINE. THAT SOME KIND OF GHETTO THREAT? LIKE, "I'M GONNA STEAL YOUR RIB SAUCE"? WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE ARMPITS, COSMO? LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NURSING A SQUIRREL UNDER EACH ARM. HMM, NICELY DONE, NICELY DONE. THAT CIGAR IS A NICE TOUCH, BUT I THINK WE GOT TO LOSE THAT MUSTACHE, FIDO. NOBODY TOUCHES MY UPPER LIP. THEY'RE REQUESTING CRISIS INTERVENTION ASSISTANCE. SEE IF YOU CAN RAISE GOLDBLUME. NO, WAIT. HE'S HERE. HENRY? UH-HUH. GOT A JUMPER ON HOBART STREET. I THINK YOU'LL WANNA GET OVER THERE. WHO'S THERE NOW? FOUR UNITS FROM JEFFERSON HEIGHTS. JUST LET ME GET RID OF SHEP'S LUNCH, AND I AM ON MY WAY. 1429. HENRY, HOW GOES THE WAR? MORNING, LEO. LISTEN, I GOT AN EMERGENCY. WOULD YOU TAKE THIS STUFF OFF MY HANDS, PLEASE? FOR SHEP, HUH? YEAH. UH, ONE FEEDING A DAY. THREE CUPS, MIXED IN WITH ENOUGH HOT WATER TO FORM A DELECTABLE GRAVY. GOT YA. IN HALF A DOZEN INSTANCES, THIS GUY'S USED MACE TO STUN HIS VICTIMS. HE'S FAST AND HE'S STRONG, SO BE ALERT. BE SURE TO CRUISE THE ISOLATED AREAS OF THE PARK. BACKUPS, YOUR MORE ATTRACTIVE DECOYS... WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE HARASSED. BE PATIENT. DON'T MOVE IN UNLESS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE SOMETHING'S COMING DOWN. UH, RAY CALLETANO HERE WILL BE YOUR RAMROD IN THIS OPERATION. HE'LL BE MONITORING YOUR WIRES ON THE FIELD RADIO, ALONG WITH ALF CHESLEY. ALL RIGHT? FAY, HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE, PHIL. HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE, UM, FRANK IS? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SURE. I JUST HAVE TO WORK OUT THE PLANS FOR FRANK JR.'s WEEKEND. OH, HE'S BUSY DOWNSTAIRS, BUT HE SHOULD BE UP IN A FEW MINUTES. CAN I FIX YOU A CUP OF FRESHLY BREWED COFFEE?

IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN OCCASIONAL DYSFUNCTION, THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, ESPECIALLY WITH SOMEONE LIKE CINDY, WHERE YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE TO PERFORM. NO, NO, NO. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH CINDY IS MORE DOMESTIC. WE DO A LOT OF COOKING TOGETHER. THEN THE PROBLEM'S NOT SEX? MY PROBLEM IS THAT I MET THIS OTHER WOMAN. SHE'S A LOT OLDER THAN CINDY. WELL, MOST OF US ARE. BUT IN SPITE OF HER AGE, OH, SHE HAS AN INSATIABLE APPETITE... FOR LIFE. PHIL, DON'T YOU KNOW MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN REACH THEIR SEXUAL PRIME... TILL THEY'RE IN THEIR LATE 30s? LOOK, IF YOU FIND THIS TOO EMBARRASSING, I UNDERSTAND. HEY, I'M NOT EMBARRASSED. YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MONOGAMOUS BY NATURE, BUT THIS OTHER WOMAN... WOW!

I THINK HE AND JOYCE DAVENPORT MAY HAVE A LITTLE THING GOING, SO WHAT WE DO IS CONSOLIDATE HIS NEGOTIATION... WITH A HALF A DOZEN OTHERS WE HAVE PENDING, SPECIFICALLY, THE SHARKEY CASE. SHARKEY? SHARKEY'S LOOKING AT MURDER ONE. WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH LaRUE? YOU JUST LET ME HANDLE THAT, CAPTAIN. THANKS, PHIL. THE POINT IS THAT SKIP FITZGERALD'S HOT TO HORSE-TRADE... FOR A QUICK DISPOSITION ON SHARKEY. NOW, IF LaRUE PLEADS NO CONTEST, SKIP'LL WAVE PROSECUTION AND TOSS IT BACK TO THE POLICE BOARD OF RIGHTS... TO DO WHATEVER THEY THINK LaRUE'S GOT COMING TO HIM.

I DON'T KNOW YET. MAUREEN AND ME, WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 18 YEARS, EVER SINCE WE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN JUNE. EIGHTEEN YEARS AND FIVE KIDS. YOU DON'T JUST GET UP AND WALK OUT ON SOMEBODY. NOT MAUREEN. SHE... IT WOULD KILL HER. THE KIDS GROWING UP, HATING MY GUTS... I COULDN'T DO THAT, FRANK. AND I COULDN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF LOSING SARIKO. I HAD TO MAKE AN HONEST WOMAN OUT OF HER, FRANK. SHE'S AN OLD-FASHIONED WOMAN. I GUESS I GOT A WEAKNESS FOR OLD-FASHIONED GIRLS, HUH? FERTILE MYRTLES, BOTH OF THEM. YOU KNOW, KIDS COST, FRANK. YOU KNOW THAT. THEY COST. THEY NEED. THEY SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING THAT WE NEVER HAD BEFORE, FRANK. MY OLDEST, CARLY... SHE'S GOING TO NURSING SCHOOL. SHE'S GONNA BE A SURGICAL NURSE. WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO ABOUT THIS, MACAFEE? YOU'VE GOT TWO WIVES AND EIGHT KIDS... AND A LOT OF DIRTY MONEY. AND YOU'VE GOT LaRUE HANGING OUT THERE BY HIS FINGERNAILS. LaRUE... HE'S A LAME PLAYER, A SLOW THINKER. NO, HE'S NOT! HE HAD A LAME DAY, IS ALL. YEAH, TELL ME MORE. I'M 10 TIMES THE COP HE EVER WILL BE! I GOT 11 DECORATIONS, FRANK... TWO FOR VALOR. YOU KNOW I'M UP FOR LIEUTENANT NEXT JANUARY? YOU KNOW THAT? THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME. DON'T LET IT HAPPEN, FRANK. I DON'T WANNA LOSE EVERYTHING. ONE OF US... FIND A WAY, WILL YOU? PLEASE? ONE OF US HAS TO GO DOWNTOWN AND EXPLAIN IT. I THINK YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF IF YOU DO IT. FRANK. NOW, MACAFEE. YOU DO IT NOW. DID ANYBODY SEE THE MORGAN FILE? DID ANYBODY CLAIM THIS APPLE? GOING ONCE. WHO'S THAT? IS THAT HIM? YEAH. HE'S SICK. LUCY'S DOWN AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM. WE'RE ALL GONNA PUNCH OUT. WE FIGURE IT'S HER COLLAR. RIGHT. HEY, BELKER. YOU GOT A VISITOR, BABE. HI. MICK, I-I'M DEBBIE KAPLAN. YOU'RE, UH... YOU'RE A VERY NICE PERSON. I MEAN, YOU'RE MUCH NICER THAN I EVER EXPECTED. BY THAT I MEAN YOU'RE NOT A REAL DOG. THANK YOU. YOU'RE PRETTY NICE-LOOKING YOURSELF. HEY, YOU GUYS. IT'S LOVE. MM-HMM. I CAN TELL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT DOWN? HOW'D IT GO AT INTERNAL AFFAIRS? PIECE OF CAKE. THEY CHEWED MY LEG A LITTLE AND SLAPPED MY WRIST. THAT WAS IT. J.D., YOU LIE THE WAY THE REST OF US BREATHE. I HAPPEN TO KNOW THEY GAVE YOU AN OFFICIAL REPRIMAND AND SIX MONTHS' PROBATION. YOU'VE BEEN SKATING ON THIN ICE, MY FRIEND. NEXT TIME YOU FALL THROUGH, I MAY JUST LET YOU SINK. YOU'RE A HELL OF A COP WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR GAME, J.D. DON'T BLOW IT. I WON'T. YOU GOT MY WORD ON THAT. THANKS. OH, HOLD ON. DO WE HAVE ANYONE WHO CAN SPEAK SPANISH? - YOU ALL RIGHT, PHIL? - MMM. UH, HENRY MENTIONED YOU HAD TO GO OFF ON A PERSONAL MATTER. NOTHING SERIOUS, I HOPE. OH, NOT IN THE WAY YOU THINK, FRANCIS. NOT HEALTH OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE. - UH, DO YOU MIND, UH... - PLEASE. FRANCIS, HAVE YOU EVER HAD TWO WOMEN... TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU? TOTALLY? UH, I CAN'T SAY AS I HAVE. WELL, NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. BUT I TAKE IT YOU AND... IT'S NO LAUGHING MATTER. WHEN I TOLD HER ABOUT THE OTHER WOMAN, CINDY LOCKED HERSELF IN THE BATHROOM. I FINALLY HAD TO KICK DOWN THE DOOR. THEN I HAD TO RESET THE HINGES AND PUT IT BACK UP. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T NOT HAVE A BATHROOM DOOR. DID YOU FINALLY GET IT WORKED OUT SATISFACTORILY? DID YOU GET IT WORKED OUT, PHIL? OH. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO. I'M BASICALLY OF THE MONOGAMOUS PERSUASION. OH, AFTER TODAY, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW REFRESHING THAT IS TO HEAR. HILL STREET STATION. I'VE GOT TO YIELD TO YOU ON THIS ONE, FRANK. I THOUGHT LaRUE WAS AS DIRTY AS ORIGINAL SIN. HE MAY BE A LITTLE ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES, COUNSELOR. I'LL YIELD TO YOU ON THAT ONE. BUT HE'S TOO SMART A COP TO GO ON THE GIMME. THIS TIME, BUT PAY ATTENTION. LaRUE'S A TIME BOMB. AND YOU DON'T WANNA BE TOO CLOSE WHEN HE GOES OFF AGAIN. COME HERE. MMM. OH! FIRST-RATE DIGITS, MARRED ONLY BY NEGLECTED FINGERNAILS. WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS, ANYWAY, PAUL NEWMAN? WHO, LaRUE? MACAFEE. TRY TO KEEP UP WITH THE CONVERSATIONAL FLOW. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW HE WAS ABLE TO HANDLE TWO WIVES EMOTIONALLY. WHEN YOU COULDN'T EVEN HANDLE ONE. HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU AND FAY MIGHT GET ALONG UNDER THE SAME ROOF? I MIGHT ASK THE SAME OF YOU AND SKIP FITZGERALD. OH, GOOD OLD SKIP FITZGERALD. YOU THINK OF HIM THAT WAY, DO YOU? MMM. WE'VE HAD LUNCH A FEW TIMES. HE MIGHT MAKE A GOOD ADDITION TO THE PARTNERSHIP, BUT YOU'D ALWAYS BE SENIOR MEMBER, FRANK. OOH! PRETTY CLOSE CLIP, COUNSELOR. OH. SORRY. HERE, LET ME. OOH! DON'T ANSWER THAT. HELLO? OH, HI, SKIP! AW, YOU! NO, YOU'RE NOT BOTHERING ME AT ALL.
