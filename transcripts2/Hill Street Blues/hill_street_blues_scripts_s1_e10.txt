CORRIDOR "L." OH-HO. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF THE RAMPANT UNPROFESSIONALISM... THAT IS LEGEND IN THIS PRECINCT. FRANK, JUDAS! MY BOYS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS. NOT WITH A GAGGLE OF PRANKSTER APES... WHO HAVE SILLY PUTTY FOR BRAINS AND JELLY WHERE THEIR MANHOOD OUGHTA BE. HOWARD, THE WHOLE THING IS UNFORTUNATE, AND IT WILL BE INVESTIGATED. I ASSURE YOU. IF YOU'RE HERE THAT LONG. I'LL BE AROUND. ED CHAPEL'S UP AGAINST ME, AND IN MY OPINION, IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED, HE'S MUCH BETTER SUITED FOR THE JOB. EXCUSE ME, FRANK. UH... LIEUTENANT SCHNEIDER'S HERE, AND SO'S RODRIGUEZ'S PUBLIC DEFENDER. HELLO, HOWARD. SHOULD GO NICELY WITH THE MOOSE HEADS. THANK YOU, HENRY. TELL THEM I'LL BE WITH THEM IN A MINUTE. LET'S PUT OUR BACON ON THE TABLE, FRANK. WHEN IT COMES TO DISCIPLINE, YOU'RE... OH, LET'S FACE IT. YOU... YOU'RE JUST TOO DAMNED ELASTIC. TOO DAMN FORGIVING. YOUR FOCUS IS IDEAS, STRATEGIES, UH, COMMAND DECISIONS. DIVISION NEEDS YOU. AND THIS PLACE NEEDS AN IRON HAND. LOOK, HOWARD... NO, LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME... THAT THIS CONVERSATION IS PREMATURE, BUT I DON'T THINK SO. NO, I DON'T. NOT THAT I'M SAYING I'M ABOVE BEING OCCASIONALLY PREMATURE. RENKO, HEY, WOULD YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME? JUST KICK A LITTLE BIT LOWER, AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT SO MUCH FORCE. JUST USE SOME FINESSE, MAN. DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT FINESSE. I AM FINESSE. IT'S BASIC CAREER GROWTH, THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. NOW, YOU... YOU MAY MAKE SERGEANT SOMEDAY... IN THE FUTURE. APPRECIATE YOUR CONFIDENCE IN ME, RENKO. UH, ME, I WILL PASS MY EXAMS, BECOME A PLAINCLOTHESMAN, GET INTO HOMICIDE, BECOME A HOMICIDE UNIT... HOMICIDE WILL ONLY TAKE, UH, COLLEGE GRADUATES. WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M GOING BACK TO COLLEGE NEXT SEMESTER. ALL RIGHT. EVERY MAN HAS A DESTINY, THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. MM-HMM. SOME JUST GO RISING UP THAT BIG LADDER OF SUCCESS. MAYBE SOME PEOPLE SLIDE OFF TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS... OR MAYBE SOME DON'T. RIGHT. YOU TAKE FURILLO, FOR INSTANCE. FROM WHAT I HEAR, HE'S GONNA BE MADE COMMANDER. WHICH MEANS ONE OF THOSE LIEUTENANTS... MULENBURG OR HUNTER OR "CALLETAINO"... - "CALLETANO." - CALLETANO... HOWEVER YOU PRONOUNCE IT. ONE OF THOSE GUYS IS GONNA BE PUT INTO FRANK'S SLOT. MM-HMM. MY POINT IS, EVERYTHING CHANGES. NOTHING REMAINS THE SAME. EXCEPT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WISH TO JUST LOOK... FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. MEANING ME, I SUPPOSE? NO, NO. I DIDN'T MENTION ANY NAMES. WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU... YOU WERE IMPLYING. I DID NOT MENTION A NAME. YOU DIDN'T... YOU DIDN'T SAY MY NAME. BUT YOU IMPLIED IT THOUGH. I IMPLIED NOTHING. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS... WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? WHAT? WHY'D YOU NEED A SCREWDRIVER AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING? HE WAS REPAIRING THE ANTENNA ON HIS TELEVISION SET. HE'S ALREADY ANSWERED THAT. BUILDING SUPERINTENDENT SAYS THAT BASEMENT DOOR'S KEPT LOCKED TO KEEP THE JUNKIES OUT. IT WAS LOCKED WHEN WE INVESTIGATED THE PREMISES THIS MORNING. I HAVEN'T HAD A... A GOOD CHANCE TO REALLY STUDY THE ARREST REPORT, SO I THINK IT WOULD BE IN OUR BEST INTEREST NOT TO ANSWER... ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HER. I DIDN'T SEE HER OR NOTHING, MAN. I JUST... I CAME UPSTAIRS, AND... AND... AND SHE WAS LYING THERE. MUST'VE BEEN QUITE A SHOCK COMING ON HER LIKE THAT. YOU AND HER... MAYBE SPENT TIME TOGETHER? I KNOW HOW IT IS, KID. IT'S... IT'S ROUGH, TEARS YOU APART. THINGS GO SPINNING AROUND INSIDE YOUR HEAD AT A TIME LIKE THAT. MAYBE YOU TOOK A PIECE OF JEWELRY OFF HER THAT YOU'D GIVEN HER SOME TIME BEFORE. FOR MEMORY'S SAKE. IS THAT POSSIBLE? NO, I DID NOT DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT! I THINK WE'D BETTER CUT THIS OFF RIGHT NOW. LIEUTENANT. CAPTAIN. ABSOLUTELY. I WONDER IF WE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT... ON THE VICTIM WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR CLIENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER. SHE WORKED AT THE HEADS AND TAILS CLUB A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO. WE KNOW THAT, NEMO. WE ALSO KNOW SHE WAS 14 THEN. SOMEBODY MUST'VE LIKED HER, OR RECRUITED HER OFF THE HILL. WHO WAS THAT, NEMO? DO YOU THINK THAT'S OKAY, NEMO? FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRLS? MAN, SHE DIDN'T ASK ME. SHE DIDN'T TELL ME NOTHING. SHE JUST WENT, ALL RIGHT? - HER AUNT COULDN'T STOP HER? - HER? MAN, SHE DON'T CARE. SHE CAME BACK. WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE CAME BACK, NEMO, TO SEE YOU OR TO SEE HER AUNT? OKAY. THE DEPUTIES WILL BE TAKING YOU DOWNTOWN SOON. USE THE ROOM HERE, WHY DON'T YOU, COUNSELOR. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. WORD OF FRIENDLY ADVICE, FRANK. DRIVE IN YOUR OWN LANE, HUH? YOU'LL GET WHERE YOU'RE GOING A HELL OF A LOT FASTER. MAYBE SO. COME ON, FRANK. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR 15 YEARS. YOU DON'T NEED THAT STUFF TO MAKE THE JUMP. HOMICIDE'S MY PROBLEM. HEADS AND TAILS BELONGS TO VICE. LET'S NOT GO STEPPING OVER EACH OTHER JUST FOR NOTHING. YOU THINK HE'S YOUR BOY? YEAH. I WOULDN'T LICK THE STAMP TILL FORENSICS CAME IN, BUT, YEAH. I THINK YOUR PUBLIC IS AWAITING YOU. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, HUH? HOW ARE YOU, RABBI? YEAH. WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY. IT COULD GO EITHER WAY, MICK. WELL, MY GUESS IS NO ONE'S HALF AS GOOD AS YOU ARE, CAPTAIN, SO CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST OF LUCK. I THINK IT'S GREAT. SENSATIONAL. THANK YOU, MICK. UM, EVERY MAN'S GOT HIS OWN DESTINY, CAPTAIN, AND YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT GETS LEFT BEHIND. I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENS TO US PEOPLE UP ON THE HILL. YOU JUST GOTTA ERASE THAT. IT'S LIKE SHIPS THAT PASSED IN THE NIGHT... AND SAILED AWAY ALONE ACROSS LONELY SEAS. YOU KNOW. UH... EH... UH... WAIT. WAIT. NO, NO. HOLD IT, MICK. IT'S OKAY. ALL RIGHT. JUST A SECOND. OH! IT'S ALREADY HAD A ROUGH DAY. I APPRECIATE THE GOOD WISHES, MICK. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT US. WE'RE GONNA DO JUST FINE. YES, FRANCIS, I THINK YOU OWE THE MEN A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE POSSIBILITIES, MORALE-WISE, CANDOR-WISE AND OTHERWISE. YOU'RE RIGHT, PHIL. I'LL DO THAT. I CALLED FORENSICS. UH, THE RODRIGUEZ KID'S PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE MURDER WEAPON. WELL, AS SCHNEIDER SAYS, I GUESS THAT LICKS THE STAMP. OH, PHIL, UH, COULD YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS? MM-HMM. I THINK SO. UH... AND... COULD YOU ASK HENRY TO PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT? ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THANKS, PHIL. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. DIVISION'S SUCH A POLITICAL SNAKE PIT. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EQUIPPED FOR THAT. YOU'RE EQUIPPED FOR ANYTHING. IT WOULD MEAN MORE BUCKS. MANY MORE BUCKS. AND MORE TIME FOR THE BETTER THINGS IN LIFE, NAMELY, MOI. HMM. YOU WANT TO SELL ME A LITTLE? HOMEWORK, FURILLO. DO I DETECT POLITICAL ACTION IN THIS BEDROOM, COUNSELOR? YOU DETECT NO ACTION IN THIS BEDROOM. BUT SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT UP, YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW MY OPINION, WHICH IS THAT POLITICS IS EVERYWHERE, AND YOU MAY AS WELL GET GOOD AT IT. NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT, BECAUSE YOU ARE. AS I RECALL, YOU POLITICKED ME... INTO THE SACK THE FIRST DAY YOU MET ME. HOW'D YOU DO THAT ANYWAY? YOU DRUG ME, FURILLO? MMM. NOTHING IS MOVING ME OUT OF THIS BEDROOM TONIGHT, COUNSELOR. SO JUST PUT THOSE BOOKS AWAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WHEN IS THIS GONNA STOP? MIDTOWN IS HANDLING IT, FAY. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING, AND I WANT YOU TO COOPERATE WITH THEM. IF YOU HEARD THE THINGS HE THREATENED ON THE PHONE... VERY GRAPHIC. HE'S MAKING ME PHYSICALLY ILL, FRANK. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID THAT HE'S SMARTER THAN THE POLICE. HE'S NOT. WE'LL GET HIM. GUARANTEED? GUARANTEED. HOW LONG CAN FRANK JR. STAY WITH YOUR MOTHER? TILL MONDAY. SHE'S GOING TO THE HOT SPRINGS. I CAN'T ASK HER TO CANCEL. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ASK HER. CAN I GO HOME WITH YOU TONIGHT? PLEASE, FRANK? I CAN'T GO BACK THERE. YOU COULD CALL HER ON THE PHONE AND WARN HER THAT I'M COMING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. LET'S GO. IT'S NOT GONNA BOTHER ME IF... IF THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE. I-IT COULD BOTHER HER, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA FAZE ME ONE BIT. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. THEN THERE IS SOMEONE THERE. NOT THAT IT'S ANY BIG DEAL IF THERE IS.
