 Vera (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 3 - The Crow Trap - full transcript 
 Bella Furness is lured into a barn and murdered. Her body is found by environmentalist Anne Preece, who is researching reasons to prevent a quarry being dug nearby for a company headed by Godfrey Waugh, whom Vera discovers is having an affair with Anne. Bella opposed the quarry too but, with her death, her stepson Neville, whose business is failing, can sell the house. Bev McDonald is another suspect, as she blames Bella for the disappearance of her little son Lee twelve years earlier, though Bella's husband, Dougie, now a stroke victim, gave her an alibi. Vera learns from Dougie that Bella was about to change her mind and sell her house to Waugh, putting her at odds with reclusive fellow campaigner Edmund Fulwell, who has a secret of his own. Parent-child relationships hold the key to unlocking what becomes a double murder, as well as discovering the fate of Lee McDonald.

 - What have we got? - White female, late 50s. The woman of there is Anne Preece. - She found the body. - Says it's the woman from the farmhouse. - Black Law Farm? - Yeah. She did some cleaning. It's Bella. Bella Furness. She's fallen from the ladder but... cause of death you're looking at it. Single blow. Lump hammer's usual weapon of choice. We've got officers looking for the weapon. Cottage, surrounding area. Judging from the damage, they've used a fair amount of clout.

 Has anyone been up to the farmhouse? - No, not yet. - Her husband's bedridden. Go and make sure he's all right. And try not to alarm him. Mud on the rungs corresponds with the mud on her shoes. - Can I? - Yeah, samples all bagged and tagged. The... mud stops at the sixth rung. So the killer's up here waiting for her. - She gets this far... - Wallop. - Why would she want to... - Roll in the hay. Try thinking with your brain for once. - Maybe she was going to help somebody. - That would be Bella. What's this? Forensics think it's juice. Some wild berry. Probably on the killer's shoe. I was just in the kitchen and I heard a crash. I want to say I heard a yell, as well, but to be honest I'm not sure if I did. Anyway, I thought I'd better see what that was. Take your time. I went out to the barn. Her eyes were closed but... Well, you just know. - You phoned. - Yeah. I drove to the top to... - get a signal. - Why didn't you call from here? There's no landline in the Cottage. That's one of Constance Baikie's stipulations. She wanted this place to be a retreat. Did you see anybody when you drove up? - Not a soul. - Where did you have your car parked? Round the side. So anyone coming up the track wouldn't know you were here. Why are you here? I work with something called the KEA. Sorry, it's a world of acronyms. "Kemp Environmental Associates". We're doing an impact assessment. The new quarry? We're looking at the proposed site and the areas likely to be affected. You find a rare termite, the whole thing's off. - And who's on your team? - Team? There's no team. Just me, I'm afraid. - A one-man band? - Yeah. Last line of defence, anyway. Ma'am! Looks heavy enough. - Get it off to forensics. - Ma'am. It's standard equipment. - I need it. - Treat yourself to a new one. There's a nice drop. - You knock off early today? - Came back for lunch. - Who were you expecting? - No-one. Well, Bella sometimes sticks around for a glass. And you can't think of anyone who might wish her harm? I didn't know her that well. Have you got somebody you can stay with for a few days? - There's no need. - I wouldn't like to think of you on your own. That's touching, but... I can look after myself. I used to visit this place with my dad, as a kid. Baikie's Cottage. Constance Baikie was one of those women knew everything about nature. Her egg collection, second to none. The look on my dad's face when he handled those eggs. Seems an awful long way to come for a few eggs. What's that supposed to mean? She, er, leave her cottage to this environment lot, then? People are more interested in the economy than they are the environment these days. Constance would be spinning. - How's Bella's husband? - He's asleep. - His son's on his way. - Right, wait here for him. - Are you getting anything on that? - Comes and goes. See if you can get a background check on Anne Preece. Belt and braces on this one. - What's he done now? - There's been an accident. I need to have a chat with you. Mr. Furness! He said there's been an accident. - Is it my father? - No, your dad's OK. - It's your mum. - My mam? No, my mother died when I was seven. No, it's your stepmother, Neville. I'm very sorry. We found Bella in the barn at Baikie's. And we think she was murdered. - Have you tried telling my father? - Not yet. Well, I'll do it. Dad? Dad, you awake? It's Neville. Got a bit of bad news for you. Bella's been killed. It's you and me now. We'll just have to make the best of it, eh? Do you understand? Shouldn't you ask permission before you start gutting the place? This is a murder enquiry. I could always get a warrant. Have you just come back from work? - Aye. - And where's that? Kimmerston Pine. I have a workshop on Cragvale Industrial. Plenty to vouch for you? Aye, probably. Bella not too keen on the new quarry, was she? Bella and her causes. I had a hard job keeping up, to be honest. She any family? Well, I thought you knew all about her. - Holly. - Ma'am? Complete background check on Mr. Neville Furness. No wonder Bella didn't want a quarry up here. A quarry might improve it. All this space, drive you mad. No. Lose sight of this, Joe, you say goodbye to your soul. Bella Furness. Married ten years to Dougie Furness. Five years into the marriage, he's paralysed by a stroke. She's his sole carer. Prior to that she was his physiotherapist, help and get up after a previous stroke. Yesterday afternoon, she was bludgeoned to death. Nothing stolen as far as we know. No sign of sexual molestation. So what are we looking at? Motive, means, opportunity. Anne Preece? She found the body. With you so far, but why? Who else did she spend time with? And I want names to these faces. Right, you like a good read. A woman doesn't write a diary unless she's got something to write about. Now, Neville Furness. He seems happy enough to be shot of the stepmother. Well, with Bella gone and his dad incapacitated, he assumes power of attorney. Is that a motive? Farm's remortgaged, worthless. Plus, he runs his own business Kimmerston Pine. - There's Slateburn. - Yeah, go on. Company behind the proposed quarry need access to the new site. Any road would need to go through Black Law Farm. Which Bella would never contemplate. She was offered £400,000. - Turned it down. - So Neville and Slateburn both stood to gain from Bella's death. Only if the quarry gets the go-ahead. I need background on the core staff at Slateburn. I can do that. That's an awful lot of power in her hands, don't you think? Right, we've all got our jobs to do. Let's do 'em. - What? - Er...overtime. Get away, man. Baikie's Cottage. Arse end of nowhere. The National Park's our district the last time I looked. Only since they changed the boundaries. That's... your old stomping ground, isn't it? Back in the day. Bella Furness. I thought it might be worth mentioning she was a suspect in another case. Is there evidence that that's relevant? - No. - Well, let's not overcomplicate things. OK. One-off. Sorry, can I help? Northumbria Police. Boss about? - Did you make an appointment? - No, pet. But I'm here now, am I? Sorry. Would you like to wait in the office and I'll see if I can scare him up. Are you a policeman? Police officer. Why are you dressed like that? We don't all wear uniforms, pet. No, I mean like that. Godfrey Waugh? Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope. Chief Inspector. I see you've met May. This is my wife Barbara. - You work here too? - May wanted to show her face. A chance to see her dad in daylight. - I'm not that bad. - Yes, you are. - Grace, could you erm... - See? Come on. Bella Furness. Yeah, I was sorry to hear about that. - You knew her, of course. - Sure. Where were you yesterday lunchtime? I was with the head of KEA. He was telling me how much this environment survey's going to cost. Great, isn't it? I'm the one who loses out if they find rare grass or some, but I've got to pay for it. And this road you want built, - past Black Law Farm. - Access to the new quarry. Seven heavy truck movements passing Bella's house every hour. 400 new jobs versus a bit of double glazing. Oh, there's more to it than that, Mr. Waugh. - Or so Bella thought. - Well, she had her head turned, didn't she? Edmund Fulwell. Man breaks windows for a living. Opposes every new development. It's like a form of Tourette's. Sorry, what's the connection to Bella Furness? Well, he's her Heathcliff, isn't he? I don't blame her for getting carried away. She was married to a paraplegic type, wasn't she? It's a condition, Mr. Waugh, not a lifestyle choice. Still, good news for you, now the property passes on to the next of kin. Been in touch with the family at all? We dropped a card round this morning. Condolences and so on. Get the ball rolling. Listen, it's all one to me. She would have sold up sooner or later. Everyone has their price. I need you and Holly to find Edmund Fulwell. Him and his blue blood. Bring him in for a chat. Edmund Fulwell's old man was one of the Holme Park Fulwells. Used to own half of Kimmerston. He was disinherited when Edmund was a kid. Edmund! - Police! Open up! - Go away! Come on, Edmund, don't play silly beggars. Section six, mate. Section six, you know what that is? I've got a bloody legal right to be here. Who do you think the Queen got her land from? Stole it from idiots like you. Go and evict her! We just want to talk to you. Try coming in here, you're committing an offence! We're not here to evict you. We just need you to come with us. - What for? - Slateburn. - Slateburn? - And Bella Furness. I'm not in the mood for this. And you think we are? What you been using that for, Edmund? I said I'm not in the bloody mood! Get off! I haven't done anything! Let's talk about the break-in at Slateburn. It wasn't me this time. These papers... in your home. What, you break in, help yourself? I don't know why you're wasting time with this when you've a murder on your books. Well, let's just start with these papers. I'm not going to press charges. Prison'd be like a health farm to you. I'm not the only one who feels strongly about the quarry. - But for you it's personal. - It's personal for a lot of people. That land should've been yours. People with land fence themselves in. The whole of England belongs to me. You and Bella, you were close? There were none of that, if that's what you're implying. We were mates. We walked the Black Law hills together. - They were sacred to us. - Why sacred? People have been burying their dead on Black Law for centuries. A lot of the stones you find there come from Holy Island. Carried 70-odd mile to make burial cairns. Those people respected nature. We should be learning from that, not destroying it. - Who do you think killed Bella? - You've seen what those quarries do. It's violent. It's a rape of the earth. And people who profit from violence are never above using it for their own interests. She... She was a good person, you know. I don't need to tell you that. We're having a memorial for her at the church. You should be there. Ma'am. Miss Preece! Miss Preece! Intruder? A bit like this poor thing. Peck each other to death in there. Go on, bugger off. What's wrong with it? Why won't it go? Learned to love its captivity. They use a tame bird to lure in the wild one. You OK? Keeping busy. - So, this woman at the window? - That's right. - Can we take a look? - Sure. I had a look around, but she'd already gone. Could you describe her? Small. Thin. Mid-30s. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Very pale. You asked me yesterday if I'd seen anyone around the cottage. I made a mistake. I saw a woman when I was driving down. - The same woman? - Yeah, I'm sure of it. Off to the stepmother's memorial? What for? He'd only get worked up. I daresay that sounds hard-hearted, does it? And does your dad not have a say? How can he? He can't even speak. Anyway, there's a vacancy come up. Decent place, good place. No use hanging around. We won't keep you. We wondered if you saw a woman here today. Maybe coming back up the road? Short, dark hair, 30s. Can't help you, sorry. - Why? - So where are you taking him? Riverdale. - Expensive. - I am trying to do the decent thing here, in my own half-cocked fashion, right? I mean, what's he going to do stuck out here? I don't know what else to do. Go on. Silver lining. We can drink what we like now, can't we, Dad? She was his wife, Mr. Furness. And if anything gives me comfort, it's knowing that Bella were loved and not... just by Dougie, but by... anyone who met her. So, er... Thanks so much for coming. To Bella it would have meant a lot. Finally got what was coming to her. - Bev MacDonald! - I knew you'd be here. You don't mind, do you? Bad for your health. My health! - That's a good one. - Bev, where were you yesterday afternoon? - I'm a suspect? - Should you be? Used to it. Your lot treated me like dirt when my little boy disappeared. - I didn't. - You're all the same. Around the time Bella Furness was killed. - Bella Furness! - She had nothing to do with your son's disappearance. You would say that, wouldn't you? You're the copper that let her get away. Do you remember that? July 25th, 1999. The day my life ended. She had an alibi. From a man who later married her. That's not an alibi. Our failure to find your son is a raw nerve. Tell us about your pain. That's what I really want to hear about. A witness saw you near Baikie's Cottage yesterday afternoon. - She's lying. - Who said it was a she? Bella Furness has been murdered. I'm glad. Glad it was her. Did you kill her? When Lee went missing, you lot wasted hours interrogating me and Greg. You really put us through it. And now you want my help? Hey, I got these things made up. Look. Do you know who that is? It's my Lee. What he'd look like, alive, today. But do you know what? When I see him, and I do, he hasn't grown an inch. And every time... I see a copper... near my house I'm hoping that he's bringing news. It's not much to ask, is it? Something to bury, something to say goodbye to. Every night I pray to God he was carried away by the river and not taken by evil people. Can you imagine what it's like... that the last prayer left in your heart? Is a prayer that your little boy is dead? I am asking you a question! No. No, I can't. Right. Are you going to charge me or are you going to let me go? Keep it. Maybe you want to charge him. Five years old. Front door open. Mam asleep on the sofa. And off he trots. Goes for a little walk. He must have got lost. Anyway, cases like these, nine times out of ten it's the parents, and we're thinking... perhaps they wanted to get rid. It's precious time, those first few hours. You don't get 'em back. Bella was out on the moor, same time. I interviewed her myself. Bev, she just wouldn't let it go. She was so sure Bella had taken her lad. - Scapegoat? - Yeah, along with yours truly. - What did I miss, Joe? - You weren't the SIO. That makes it all right, does it? If it were you? - We all make mistakes. - I didn't make a mistake! Bella Furness had nothing to do with that lad's disappearance! You're very smart, aren't you? What do you want, anyway? Holly's got the results. - You're not going to like this. - I never do. No prints. Nothing in the barn. No trace of anything on the trees or bushes and the hammer we took from Anne Preece was clean. So let me get this right. What you're saying is we've got nothing. But remember the stain in the hayloft? Well, maybe if you hummed a few bars... What?! Forensics say it was rowan berries. - Rowan? - Bright orange berries, apparently. OK. Take what scraps I can. Ma'am, I've tried talking to Neville Furness in his business but he never seems to be in. But I did talk to a couple of his suppliers. Kimmerston Pine haven't been paying their bills. One of the suppliers is threatening legal action. Wee motive there. Right. - Guess what that was? - What? Overtime. I liked her better when she was sulking. Hello? Who's that? Clearing out the farmhouse. I... thought you might be able to use some of this. - Sorry about your... - Stepmother. - You found her, didn't you? - Yes. Yeah, I did. Why are you still here? Killer out there. - You alone in here. - Not quite alone. You met the wee smurfs outside. Anyway, I'm... I'm here to do a job. I saw you at the church. I watched you. Well... What did you see? Front door was open. Come in. Well, fancy seeing you here! Better go. Be seeing you. - Did I spoil the moment? - There was no moment. Has that woman been charged? Now, you know I can't tell you that. No, I'm here to take a fresh statement. Everything you can remember about the day of Bella's murder. - Don't leave anything out. - I didn't leave anything out. I'm sorry. I've work to do. Right, well, I'll just tag along. Nothing deters you, does it? Sooner this job's finished the better. - So did you find that woman? - We talked to her. Was it her? This all part of the survey or are you just having fun? You want a go? Quite good at throwing my weight around. You examine what's inside the quadrant. It's called ground truthing. There's nothing here but grass and weeds. Cross-leaved heath. Round-leaved sundew. Bog asphodel. Things get more interesting beneath the surface. You should know that. Found what you're looking for? - As in? - Well, you know, as in stop the quarry. I'm a scientist, you know, last time I looked. Neutral party. Anyway, I'm not done yet. Nobody's going to scare me off. See any rowan trees in your travels? On the moorland edge? No reason why not. With bright orange berries. Is that normal? Not really. Not here. That's an ornamental rowan. It would have to be introduced. You mean someone would have to plant it? Basically. Right. Thanks. - Enjoy your erm... - Ground truthing. And call off your watchdogs, would you? I don't like being spied on. You'll get the invoice in the morning. - May, - Thank you. come here. May! Dress rehearsal. Come on. I think just take it up. Just a couple of inches. You'll soon grow into it. Hey! Do you mind? Now just turn round for me. Turn slowly... - All right? - Yeah. Just finishing up. Stay for a drink? Sorry. Running late as it is. Story of my life. Celine's going to forget what you look like. OK. Night. Night. How is the bed? - Excuse me? - Upstairs. I used to come here, a lifetime ago now, did I say? My dad and Constance Baikie had that much in common. Birds, eggs, you name it. Otters. Mad about otters. My sergeant's smiling. Look at him. He knows what's coming. Tremendous aphrodisiac, otters, or something, anyway, cos sooner or later, up they'd go, two by two, for a little forage on their own. - Sorry, what? - I'm sorry, pet, no. I just wondered if you changed the bed at all. You know, you and Godfrey Waugh? It's just the same, as a matter of fact. I do pick 'em. It's any excuse with happen. I've been trying to break it off but he just won't have it and I... I get suckered in every time. Work know? - The... what is it? - KEA. God, no. Who else? Bella? No! Now something's troubling me. You see, you had two wine glasses on the table the day she died. - Well, Bella and me... - Bella didn't like to drink. So either Mr. Waugh was here, was on his way, or had just passed through. I'm afraid the timings don't work out. All-day meeting in Alnwick granted, but according to your lovely assistant outside, you broke for lunch around 12:00. Which leaves you minus an alibi. Look, I love what I do. I'm proud of what I do. What, for an access road? She would have sold in the end. I do have some moral handbrake, believe it or not. It's downhill all the way with Anne Preece. And you think I... What, just to... Put her little report to bed. Well, I can't deny it crossed my mind. Annie's all right. Her strength... makes a change. Anything to report? Thanks for your time, Mr. Waugh. Bella Furness was in every week. What if she saw them? What if she found out? Passionate about her causes. "Stop the quarry!" And here's Anne Preece shacked up with the enemy. That's a motive to shut her up. - If. - If. What? It might be nothing. I'm just... Oh, don't tell me it's all in the bloody diaries. It's not as simple as that, I'm affraid, but I photocopied everything that I thought was relevant. Look at this, "Dougie said I was the most beautiful woman "he'd ever seen." Dougie said this, said that. I think Dougie can communicate better than his son thinks. Or it's the fantasies of a lonely woman. I'd better pay him a visit. Well done, Joe. What have you got in your bait? She's put bugger all in my butty! Not even a scrap of butter. She's got a lot on her mind. My sister, when she had the twins, was a right basket case. She left them outside the post office. Well, Celine's not like your sister! Celine's fine. - All right. - I'm taking her out tonight. Right, well, I'm off. - Just want to talk to your dad. - This is ridiculous. I'm his son. If he talk, he'd talk to me. - Would he? - Of course he would. I don't want him upset with this nonsense. Does he know how Bella died? I have no idea. He just lies there. - Have you tried asking him? - He can't communicate! By the way, when you told him Bella was dead, did you have to be so blunt? - I don't think... - "Make the best of it." I think that's blunt. Yeah? Yeah, well, it was pretty much word for word how he told me my mam had died. More warmth in a statue. If he can talk, why won't he talk to me? These might help. People can change. Now, don't make me have to go back for an order. Dad? You remember Chief Inspector Stanhope. She has a few questions. Godfrey Waugh. Trying to curry favour. - Not exactly subtle, is he? - Will you sell? That's the plan. All eyes on Anne Preece, then. - Meaning? - That land of yours will be worthless... ..if her report blocks the quarry. I suppose. Do you mind if I talk to your dad alone? Hello, Dougie, remember me? It's Vera. I helped you that time when Bella was in trouble. But now, unfortunately, I'm investigating her death. And I need you... to talk to me. I know you can communicate. I've read Bella's diaries. I'm sorry, Dougie, it's my job. I said to my colleague, "Women don't keep diaries "unless they've got something to write about." She had something to write about, didn't she? She had you. I know it's hard, but if there's anything at all you can tell us to help us to catch Bella's killer... Doesn't matter how trivial. Perhaps a little bit of gossip where she worked? You... know... You show me. Godfrey Waugh. Anne Preece. She knew? What, did she confront them? No, right. Did she... talk to Mrs. Waugh? Right. But she told you. So how did she seem? Angry? I mean, Anne Preece was compromised, wasn't she? - The work on her survey. - No... For me... She did it... for me... What? I said no. Sell. And she wouldn't listen? In the end. I heard her. Talking on the phone. - Holly. - Ma'am, CSI say no trace of a phone, but it's like her husband said. 40-second call made to Waugh's office number at Slateburn quarry. Thanks, pet. Well, obviously, if I'd known! It's true. Network just confirmed we took a call from her number. So why did nobody tell me? A 40-second call. - Answer machine! - I check all messages every night. Who else has access to these phones? Well, apart from Grace and myself, one of the lads could have come in, I suppose. It's possible. - It's Grace... - Bishop. And how long have you worked here? Six months. Why? - She came highly recommended. - Yes. I'll bet. I'll check who was clocked in that day. If you'd be so kind. - Grace Bishop. 26 years old. - Criminal record? Not a squeak. Degree in catering, Coventry University. Various hotel jobs. London. Toulouse. Singapore. That's exciting. Well, what's she doing stuck in that portakabin? And would she have buried that message? Joe... No, Holly, drop in tonight. Ask her who else could have heard that message. Who does she trust? Background on the boss, that sort of thing. See what comes out. Meanwhile, Kenny, 18 staff on site that day. Background checks on all of them. - Ha ha, gutted! - Yeah, and you can help him. Ma'am, I'm going to Grace Bishop's! - No clubbing for you tonight. - I don't like clubbing. Well, there's a stroke of luck. Now, then, who else knew about Bella's change of heart? Apart from Dougie, of course. - Her stepson. - He never said anything. But we can still ask. No. Who else? - Edmund Fulwell? - Right. He and Bella, comrades in arms. Now, how's he going to react when he hears she's sold out? Two prison terms for alcohol-related violence. - He's on a hat-trick. - Well, thank you, Kenny. She never said anything to you about selling up? No. We never said anything, really. I had nothing against her, you know. I just... ..didn't want him to be happy. What a thing to say out loud, eh? I mean, look at him. And yet... he was. She made him happy. You read those pages I gave to you? From the diary? Aye. It's not the man I knew. I can't imagine how he must be suffering. A son with any love in him would end it. Or give him something to live for. Hey, who's the lucky fella? We had a deposition. Godfrey Waugh sent the fragrant Barbara round with a bunch of flowers. They don't give up, I'll say that for them. Any second thoughts about selling? I didn't till she showed up. It felt sort of tacky, to tell you the truth. Selling the family silver. Anyway... I'll talk to my dad. Quick half? Dutch courage? Nah, I've not got time. What? Out with it. She's dead clever, isn't she, Holly? - If you say so. - Well, you think so. Sending her to Grace Bishop, you must think she's got something. Right. You're loving this, aren't you? She's young, female. She can play the sister card. You can't. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, I thought that was the case. Night. Wait! Wait! - I need your help! - What's - going on? - Celine's not there. - What? - Jessie and Michael are in. There's no-one with them. You hungry? I've got er...some... They're quite nice. Take a bit of getting used to. A Fisherman's Friend? No? All right. - Are you Mussolini? - I beg your pardon? Mussolini. The lady that Dad works for. Well, yeah, I expect that's me. - Is that what your mam calls me? - We all do. That's nice. Here they are now. Guys, come on. No. No sign. She left work around three hours ago, apparently. What's that? Grace? Grace Bishop? Forensics came through. Blood on the wheel brace. Right. Sorry to wake you up. I want a full description and photo of Grace Bishop circulated. Usual warnings. And if you were halfway fit, we wouldn't be going to this trouble. Where's Joe, anyway? Probably stopped off for a decent sandwich. - What have you got? - Local history thing. Hey... Don't say anything. "To Grace with love." - Any news? - This one of yours? Listen, you've got it wrong about Grace, you lnow. If there was anything going on... She's part of the furniture, really. - May is devoted to her. - Your daughter? How about you, Mr. Waugh? I think she's more May's generation than mine. That's a relief to hear you say that. Did Grace have any friends that you know about? We wondered about a boyfriend but I don't know. - She was always out walking. - She never mentioned anyone? You might try Barbara. Not to me. No, sorry. Girl in a hurry. Smells good. Trying to get a head start on supper. Why? Do you... No, no. Thank you. I'm... I bet people are always feeding you up! One of those faces. Your wife much of a cook? I saw the ring. Well... Small baby, you know. How old? Four months. There's never any time, that's the trouble. She gets so tired. It's quite normal. Yeah. I know. Do one thing for me, would you? Take her to a doctor. Kick her through the door. You have to do. No, it's nothing like that. She's just a bit done in. Sorry! I'm so sorry, dishing out free advice. No. No. Enjoy your dinner. - Any use? - Aye. Nah, not really. She gave us a bit of a pep talk. Busybody. Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs! - What you got there? - Golden oldie. Edmund Fulwell with a little boy. You think that's your missing lad? Lee? What, Lee MacDonald? No. It's a little girl. Look. But what's it doing there? Unless... What do we know about Grace's family? You think that's her? You think that's Grace? She's Edmund's daughter? We could ask. I don't know, do I? Someone must have seen us together. - When? - How should I know? Police were asking questions. It won't take long, will it? Can we please just come clean? If we go together, it'll be all right. It's a bit late now. Why did I let you talk me into this? Because this is my land! - They bloody well stole it from me! - That was a lifetime time ago. Well, if you're not going... No. Don't. No, no, don't, please! - This'll finish me! - There's other jobs! - I don't want another job! - Where's your loyalty? Don't say that like you know what it means! Those people you hate, they're a real family. And the way they are with that little girl... You're so blind you don't even know who your real friends are. All those years... Not so much as a birthday card! The Christmas parties I spent sitting in the hall in case you came and I missed you. Some dad! What do you want? We just want to talk to you, Edmund. We're looking for Grace Bishop. Your daughter. Well, she left. - Where is she? - I don't know. How did you get that mark on your face? I don't know. Branch, probably. So why have you trashed your lovely home? It's my home. I'll do what I like with it. Something she said? Close, are you? I hardly knew her when she was growing up. Her mother looked after her. I used to visit, try and help with her. But when it came down to it, I was... ..too bloody selfish. You give her this? No. Still, she took that job here for you, didn't she? At the quarry. Help with your crusade. A spy in the camp. - Some spy. - She settled in up there, didn't she? Handing over documents of the firm, wasn't she? Wanted to be needed, I expect. First your soul mate betrays you, then your daughter. What? Bella changed her mind an' all, didn't she? Called Godfrey Waugh. Left a message consenting to the sale. Two hours later... No! No, never. No, never. Bella would never do that. Not in a million years. Grace never said anything to you? She must have heard that message. Someone wiped it, you see. She said something about... ..not knowing who my friends were. Is that what she meant? Is that what she meant? Did Bella betray me? Did she? Four minutes past one. Time of death. You'd think she'd have treated herself to a decent timepiece. I bet she never treated herself to anything. Looks like a hammer again. Blow delivered with considerable force. Doesn't mean she didn't kill Bella. Two killers employing the same method. Possible. - However unlikely. - Yeah, way above my pay grade. Can I have that in writing? There's lots of little scratches. - Crows. - A murder of crows. Collective noun for crows. A murder. Suit yourselves. I've been saving the best till last. Trace of blood and... there... What are they? Some kind of seed, again. See if these are the same as last time. Rowan. Our rowan tree? Well, how did you find it? I used a bit of this, you know. The ancient knowledge. That Anne Preece found it, didn't she? Technically, yeah. She phoned to tell me when we were at the quarry. Maybe somebody's nurturing it. People used to plant them to ward off witches. Not working, then, is it? Here I am. And to stop the dead haunting the living. How old is it, do you think? Right, now this is complicated so get your brains out of neutral. Item number one. Now, some of us assumed that Grace Bishop used this to kill Bella Furness? Kenny, take us through the forensics. Fox blood. Fox hair. Fox DNA, lots of fox-related stuff. Probably ran over a fox, used that to put the fox out of its misery. There could be two murderers. Kenny? Bella Furness. Grace Bishop. Now, the shape and extent of the damage is pretty much identical in both cases. When we cleaned the blood away, we found there was a distinctive nick on the face of what we assume was a hammer here... and here. Different victim, same weapon, same method. Now, we've been working on the theory that Bella Furness was murdered because of her opposition to the quarry. She changed her mind. Decided to sell the access route to Slateburn. Left a message saying as much. But somebody heard that message and wiped it. What if Grace Bishop found the message? Wipes it, has a change of heart, big fight with her father. Her father. Motive and means for both Bella and his daughter. If anyone's going to kill for a pile of rocks, it's him. But his own daughter? Or... Park the phone message. These two, Anne and Godfrey. Bella knew their little secret. What if Grace found out? It's easy enough. She worked for him. Fancied him. Allegedly. What if... What if she was jealous? Picked a fight with Anne Preece? Grace, she knew about you and Godfrey Waugh. Please don't waste your breath. She ever lean on you to stop? Grace? No. - Was she attracted to the boss? - No. No, she indulged him, but she didn't fancy him or anything. - She did come here once. - When? A few days ago. It was more of a warning, really. Well, the survey. Basically, just cos you fancy the guy, make sure you write a fair report. I thought, good for you. Though I was kind of insulted at the same time. Work comes first. You understand that, don't you? Aye. Although what she'd have made of this, - I don't know. - The report? All done. I'm out of here, as you can see. Is that it? My life in a box. I travel light. That's the best way. And I have to ask. - The report? - All clear. Send in the diggers. Godfrey's doing cartwheels, no doubt. Still, this whole place. Isn't there a tiny part of you thinks, "Tear it up, let it go"? This land, the way it sucks us all up. Once it's gone, it won't come back. That's true. At least that wandering ghost can put her feet up. My face at the window. I saw her again earlier. Today? You were seen out past Black Law! What were you doing there? - Fancied a stroll. - Bev, Bev, two women are dead. I am not in the mood for this. Did you see her? Look! This woman, out on the moor? Do you think I killed her? What has dragged you back to this place? You know. The quarry. I read about it online. I thought... go back. One last look before they tear these hills to kingdom come. Thought maybe he'd feel the same. Lee's dad? I thought maybe he'd see me. See what I'm going through. And realise he should never have walked out. Sacred ground. To me, anyway. Up near Black Law, there's a rowan tree. Pretty orange berries. Did you plant it? In memory? No. Well, someone did. A rowan tree? Thanks for your help. Holly Lawson. OK, I'll let her know straightaway. Ma'am, I think you need to hear this. It's your fault! Do you hear me? It's your fault! You're not looking so clever now, Fulwell. I'll rip your bloody head off! Get off! No! I'm going to rip your head off! I'm going to rip your bloody head off! He was threatening to kill me. I'm coming for you! Should have been dealt with a long time ago. Mr. Waugh, wait inside. Get off my property! Watch your head as you're going in. - Bastard! - Get him in. Forensics called. The blood under Grace Bishop's fingernails was Edmund Fulwell's. That scratch on your face, you never got it from a branch, did you? (SOBS) I can't remember. Now, I need you to think, Edmund. And I need you to tell me the truth. You and Grace had a fight. Did you hurt your daughter? - Down at the quarry? - No. No, it was in the shack. I grabbed... I grabbed hold of her. I didn't want to let her go. So you had your fight. What was it she said? "You don't know who your friends are". Is that right? I don't know! I can't remember. Edmund... I need you to think. She said... She said she needed to see someone. She... She said she needed to get something sorted out in her head. Who? See who? She never said. Well, if it's him, all well and good, but if it's not... Crow trap! Hang out one bird... to catch... another. Maybe we've set a trap and we don't even know it! If there's somebody killing to save these hills from the quarry, if that's what we're looking at, Anne Preece alone in that cottage. She's finished the survey. Green light to the diggers. What's our murderer going to say about that? I'll talk to Godfrey Waugh, see who else knows. Keep an eye on Edmund. Joe, Anne Preece now! Your mam and dad not about? You're the detective. Would you mind giving one of them a shout for me, pet? Mum! I can see you haven't changed much. That's not me. - That's Josh. - Who's Josh? My brother. And where's he now? He died before I came. He didn't last very long. I'm sorry to hear that. Your parents must have been glad when you came along. That's how I got my name. Mum said she thought the winter was never going to end. - What you up to? - Making a card. For Grace? Listen, you wouldn't run up and get them, would you, pet? They've gone out. - You gave me a start. - Sorry, I did knock. I just brought these over. To say goodbye, you know. I was about to put the kettle on. GP confirms Barbara Waugh had a son, Joshua. Four weeks old when he died. She suffered from depression and was hospitalised. - When, Holly? - On and off through '99. Lee MacDonald! Sorry, the number you are calling cannot be... - Where's Anne? - She just went to stock up on firewood. I spoke to my wife. Your wife? About, you know... The baby. Well, that's good, isn't it? Sorry, is this the... The old report. For the KEA? Old? Anne had a change of heart. She feels perhaps she's been in too much of a rush. Since when? One more week, she said. Just to be sure. I might go and help with that firewood. Don't go. Help! Help me! - Hello? - I'm here! Joe! Joe? Barbara? I know you're here. I know about your little boy. We're down here! - He won't move. - I'm so sorry, pet. Joe! Joe. Joe. Joe, lad. Come on, Joe, wake up! Come on. Come on, Joe. Come on. Joe, come on, son. Wake up, wake up! How am I going to look Celine in the face after this? Joe, please wake up. Come on, come on, lad, it's Vera. It's Vera. Look at me. There's a good lad. There's a good lad! OK. Don't let him move. Somewhere... must be... Joshie... Who are you? Is this where you put him? Under a tree? It's all right. I kept him safe. He's... He's down here. I'm just getting him now. What's he doing down there? Sacred ground. And you found him, didn't you, Barbara? You found Lee. He'd got lost... down by the river, and I took him home and I said... I said, "It's OK, Joshie, you're home now. "There's no need for all that", but... he wouldn't have it, you see. - He kept saying - - "I want to go home". I just got... confused, you see. I'd lost my own little boy and I was... Well, he kept fighting. He kept saying he wanted to go... Home. And I just... He wouldn't stop screaming. And I... I just... Just put my arm across him, across his... I just wanted him to be quiet and then... He just lay there. And I... I shook him. He just wouldn't move. I'm so sorry. There's not a day that goes by that I don't... But I kept him safe, for you, for us. Only, they wanted to dig him up. - The quarry? - I couldn't have that. I mean, I couldn't have that. It's his home. This tree. He just wants a bit of peace. You do see that, don't you? If we can just find him, maybe... That's it. That's enough. What about me? What about my peace? Did Barbara say anything about Grace Bishop? I mean, why did she have to kill her? I don't know. Well, Bella leaves the message on the office answer machine. Barbara and Grace are both there. Both hear it. 'Let me tell my husband,' says Barbara. "Don't breathe a word till we know the woman's serious". Wipes the message, then Bella dies. Days pass. Godfrey's still none the wiser. And Grace, she's fond of Barbara. The mother she never had, I suppose. She gets to thinking, "Why has she buried that message?" She confronts her... in the end. Asks her why. "Why have you not told your husband? He should know!" Out by the quarry, where we found her? Why didn't she tell her husband toset up a quarry somewhere else? Desperate for her husband's good opinion. Terrified he'd realise what she'd done. To her, this was sacred ground. Depression? All of this? There was more to it than that, I think. Hey, come on, get home. Stick that wife of yours in a frock. Give her a treat. I'll baby-sit if you like. I don't think that's going to happen. Fair enough. Last thing they need is me goose-stepping round the house. Mussolini? I'm sorry about that. Jessie cannot keep her mouth shut. Get in. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy. Slow to anger and of great goodness. As a father is tender towards his children, so is the Lord tender to those that fear. For he knows of what we are made. He remembers that we are but dust. Our days are like the grass. We flourish like a flower of the field. When the wind goes over it, it is gone. And its place will know it no more. But the merciful goodness of the Lord endures forever and ever towards those that fear him and his righteousness upon their children's children. Amen. Into your hands, oh merciful saviour, we commend your servant. Acknowledge a lamb of your own flock, a sinner of your own redeeming. Enfold him in the arms of your mercy, in the blessed rest of everlasting peace... ITFC Subtitle Sync: Marocas62
