 [laughing] - Ashley brought her baby along. - Michael's not watchin' Dean this weekend? - No, no, I can't be away from him. I just can't. Yeah. - Ashley. - Which set Wendy off. - I don't have sympathy for her saying she's a new mother. I just had a baby, and this will my first time away from Kam-Kam. I had to prepare for all of these things just to be able to be here and to be present. The cheat sheet would've been, okay, just bring your baby. I wanna know you ladies on a deeper level but more important... [screaming]

 - This is not what I had planned. - This is why you don't have a lot of female friends. - No, I don't have a lotta female friends 'cause I don't deal with fake bitches like you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oh, my God. - So, don't do it.

People like you don't call me Wendy. - Bye, Wendy. Bye, Wendy. - People like you call me Dr. Wendy. - Bye, Wendy. Bye, Wendy. - Address me correctly, sweetie. - Please walk out as fast as you walked in. Let me call your car. [laughing] - I'm trying to figure out what planet Wendy is on. Usually, I'm crazy. Your ass is whacked. ♪ We're moving on ♪ - Hey, you can't call my car. - Can somebody send Wendy back to Baltimore? Thank you. - Move on to something new. - You can't call your car 'cause your phone is disconnected, you brokie. Go away. - Brokie? - That's stupid, Wendy. That's stupid. - I have four degrees. I'm not stupid. I have four degrees. I'm not stupid. [laughing] - We already have a Candiace, somebody that just does know how to control their mouth. We do not need two of that type of energy, for real. - What are you saying? - Pluck you. You're a bug. You're a bug.

And like... her husband is rich, so... it's kind of stupid. My husband's rich, too. So, it wasn't stupid. [laughing] You know what I mean? I didn't say Michael was broke. I said Ashley is broke. Her bootyhole is broken. So, you broke times two. You broke-broke. - We're not makin' progress here. You're new to the group, and I know you don't know the work we've put in. I don't think I called any of you guys bitches in five years. - No. - That's pretty low. - Robyn, you are the dizziest bitch sittin' at the table. - The dizziest what? - Bitch. - Oh. - That's not cool. - Look, we have to move forward. - I don't want to bring no more drama, so I'm done.

I mean, it's-it's whatever. - If you are a compassionate woman who is another mother, please support me. Don't start yelling at me for doing something that I needed to do for the health of me and my son. - Wendy, he wants to talk. - I thank you for allowing myself and my team to come cook for you guys. - I think we should give chef a round of applause. You killed it. - Yes! - You killed it. Thank you. - Shots! In honor of the chef! - To the chef! - To the chef. - Thank you, chef. - All right, everybody, great dinner. Thank you. - So, let's go. - Okay, all right, okay. Did everybody get their accoutrements? - I can't get a damn signal to save my life. - Let's see.

I said, no, (BLEEP) you. I'm not apologizing. I will not. I feel as though the ladies are not only disregarding but disrespecting how I feel towards my daughter. Kam's arrival is different than my other two. Kam was born two months early, and them hoes were not in the NICU with me. So, no, you can't tell me how I should and shouldn't feel. - When you was like, "Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, "and you a fake-ass bitch," I was like, "ooh". [laughing] That made my bootyhole clinch up a little bit. I was like... - Was that too much? - You know, I don't wanna say it was too much. - I really felt it in my spirit, though. - This group will take you there. - Let's go. - It's probably not the best juju to call someone a fake-ass bitch who you've met only yesterday, but I want Wendy to feel welcome, not have her run screaming into the damn Potomac, child. She's wearing a wig. Be respectful. Tomorrow's a new day. It's going to be fun. - Tomorrow's a new day. - So, you know, continue to let us know who you are. - Got you. - I got my edges covered. ♪♪♪ - I know you're thrown off, but you gotta eat some food.

Don't ever disrespect my pancake and turn it on its back. Put it upside where the butter is, and they need to be sliced the perfect way, so you have a center.

Now, if the Lord puts something together, sure, I obey the Lord, but I'm not going to go out of my way to forge a conversation with her. - Uh, where's Ashley at, y'all? - Ashley's got the baby. - You wanna try to call daddy? Wanna see how daddy is this morning? Very slim chance he's gonna answer. He had that big celebration last night, daddy closing big deals.

Don't hate. - I'm not hating. - It's all about the taste. - Gizelle's pancakes were a little messy but good on the inside, and then you have Monique's pancakes that were aesthetically pleasing and giving nothing on the inside. - Okay, well, who won the competition? - Oh, it's all about the taste. - The total... when it comes to overall, what do we love?

So, I'm trying to figure out where you were comin' from. - I don't feel as though my child is of age for them to be by themselves for this long, and then to see another baby here... - Yeah. - Is like a realization that, wow, my baby could've been here. - Got it.

I want us to have a good time and not be shading each other, and talking sh..., and grabbing asses. All that stuff can go to the wayside, child. Let's just have a good time together. We're ready. - We're really nervous over here. Oh, my gosh. - Okay, all right. - I'm gonna announce the first runner up. - Yes. - First. - Okay, okay. - Oh, my God. [sighs] - In the competition... of the Lady of the Lake, first runner up goes to... ♪♪♪ Ashley Darby. [applause] ♪♪♪ And the winner of the Lady of the Lake goes to... Candiace. - I mean, I'm just happy she won a crown. Probably on board with the last one she won. ♪♪♪ - This crown, it was always mine. [sighs] Thank you. - Good job, ladies. - Well, we can go get ready for dinner. We have a little bit of extra time if y'all wanna just kinda... - Nap time. ♪♪♪ - Oh, sh... Didn't mean to do that. ♪♪♪ - What is it? Uh-huh. Yeah. What? Yeah. I could play with you all night. Okay, I only have 20 minutes to get dressed. So... [sighs] - All right. - Bye. - Bye. Have fun.

She works at an establishment where she has a friend who witnessed Michael asking random women to come back to his hotel with him. I've had enough drama with Ashley, with the Darbys as a whole. I don't want this. ♪♪♪ Gizelle? - Hey, girl. - Hey. Um... - What's goin' on? - Can-can we go outside for, like, two seconds? - Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, okay. - I, like, ran over here. - Okay. - Yeah.

Okay, so, I don't know what to do. - Okay. - A good friend of mine... ...text me. - Uh-huh. - She says, "Your girl's baby daddy "was out at the strip club last night." - Whose baby daddy? Okay, read the text out loud verbatim. - "My girl is a bartender at the strip club, "and I came to see her. "He was there with several strippers. "He was talking about how he has a boyfriend "and a wife." - He said, "I have a wife and a boyfriend?" - A wife and a boyfriend. "He was asking who he could take to a hotel nearby." It's like all this sh... All this sh... - I pray to God that this is all just, like, a lie. This is an exaggeration, 'cause Ashley has been gone for seven minutes. Like, she just left. - The picture didn't come through right away. - Right. - So, I was like maybe it's somebody else. - Right. - And the picture came through. This is him. What am I supposed to do? What? - Okay, okay, okay, let's think about this. - Like, we... [sighs] - Let's-let's- let's process this. Okay. You and Ashley just became friends. - Exactly. [laughing] - Okay, that... - Like, I can't... I can't have this, but I also can't not let her know. - We need to tell her tonight. She gotta know. - This dinner's gonna... ing suck. - Coming up next... - How is Michael doin'? - I think... I think they had a little boys night after the dinner last night 'cause he had some guys in town from New York. - Oh. - Took 'em to MGM. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. ♪♪♪ - Ooh! - Ooh! - Whoa! Mighty fancy for the crab shack. Okay. - Ashley, does that zipper open in the back? - Oh, that's a zipper. - Okay, I think the cars are here.

I want food. - This is great. - Perfect. - This is very nice. - Like, there are several seats. Why does she have to sit next to me? Like, why? I'm playing it cool, but I-I feel bad. - I feel like, today, we had a lot of fun. Yesterday was a little shaky. - Yes. - Mm-hmm. - Speaking of which... - Yes. - I got a chance to talk to Ashley. - Oh. - And I actually apologized to Ashley. - Fantastic. - That was very nice. It really was nice. - That's awesome. - I think it was a lot of, uh, stress because of what we had to do to get here, and all of us are very busy. - Yes. - It's hard to carve out time. - True, true. - We have kids. We have families. We have husbands. - How is your, um, "Not for Lazy Moms"? - It's good. Whenever I do have issues with Chris' mom, we actually approach his mom together. Actually, we have a live podcast coming up. I would love for all y'all to come. - Okay. - Hey, ladies, how we doin' today? - Hey, how are you? - We just need a wine cork and some glasses. - Okay. - Do you have Corona Light? - Regular crabs. - We'll share that. - Okay, sure. - Yeah. - Two orders? - That's gonna be three. - Thank you. - I'll be back to you, okay? - Thank you so much. - Uh-huh. - So, how have your significant others been since you've been away? - So, I called Juan when the kids... When it's time for the kids to have been off to school. - Right. - Oh, this is funny. - Ooh. - And he's like, "Um, yeah, "I just let them stay home." They... - What? - I was like, I can't... One day, like, one day? - Hilarious. - One day. - We can't get it right one day. - Uh-huh. - No. Every time I leave, I always leave Chris with a whole staff of people around the clock. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, well, that's nice. - I need to start doin' that for myself sometimes. - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. - I told him he should do it for me. - No, you just do it for you. - Reiterate that. - No, but I would like for him to think and say, "You know what?" - Right. - "She's busy. Let me surprise her." - Yeah. - I feel her pain. Being an athlete, like, people are, like, waiting on them hand and foot. What we went through financially humbled Juan in so many ways. So, I don't know. I mean, as long as their money is good, Chris might not ever change. - Here we go, guys. I got some seafood for you guys. - Yes. - Oh, my goodness, okay. - Oh, yes. [indistinct chatter] - Another one over here. - It's a lot of food. - It's just too much work, and then you, the waste... - So, what are you doin' over there? - I'm doing shrimp and crab legs. - Okay. - It's really not. If you get... if you get... If you get the technique, it's actually not. - What? - But the yellow stuff takes... - The poop. - That's mustard. That's mustard. - It's poop. - It's not muard. It's poop. I don't eat the poop. - I don't want that. - Good, good. - I don't wanna look at that. - That's... my mom said that was mustard. - She lied. She was trying to get you to eat. - It's not. It's not. - Mustard? - I thought it was like-like a natural mustard. - It's poop, like eggs. - No, that's poop. ♪♪♪ - Ugh. - Tastes good to me. ♪♪♪ - We know you don't care about presentation. We know. - You know what? - She just wanted to eat, and it taste good. - You know what? [laughing] - So, Karen. Karen, has Ray been missing you? - I talked to Ray today. Ray is coming tomorrow. He said he missed me. However, I think Ray is at a point in life where he appreciates every day, if you will. So, like today, he's like, "Oh." I'm like, "I miss you so much." He said, "Well, it's a great golf day." - I just think, at this point, Karen is not a bad person, but I just feel as though she's phony. She's not honest about how she feels about me, and she's not honest about what she says, and I just wanna get to the bottom of it. - How is Michael doin' without you being there with baby Dean? - He's good. He's okay. He had a very big dinner last night. - Okay. - For a big project he closed. So, he's got a lotta things goin' on. - That's good. - Yeah. - He's-he's got his mind occupied while you're here. - Yeah, but he's ready for us to come home. That's for sure. - He's holding up. I bet he is. - Yeah. - But he's probably gettin' some good sleep. I hope. - I think so. I think... I think they had a little boys night after the dinner last night 'cause they had guys in town from New York. - Oh. - Took 'em to MGM. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - I have to tell Ashley your husband is out here in these streets.

[horn honking] Hey! - Baby. - How you doin'? - How about you all imitate your wife? - This is Monique. No, I'm playin'. [laughing] - Oh, my God. - It's not that hard being considerate. - I'm not arguing with you. - But you can give the consideration of saying. - I'm not arguing with you. - That's fine. - If you wanna fight, fight by yourself. - You don't knohow to consider other people. - Candiace! Candiace, come sit down! - Everything is about what she wants to do on her terms. - I can definitely see some cracks in Monique's perfect persona. - Candiace brings this text to me saying that you were saying things about how you have a boyfriend and a wife. - Oh, no. - Was there any truth to that? - No, but something happened at the casino.
