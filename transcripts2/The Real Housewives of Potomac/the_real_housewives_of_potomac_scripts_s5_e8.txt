Like, done-done.

 You gonna drag me? - Do you want me to? - Drag me. - Do you want me to? - Drag me. Drag me. - No! - Do you want me to? - One of the first things that I remember about being in DC was go-go music, and what really makes it unique is the conga drum or the cowbell, and it just made sense to remix my love song to my husband. Chris sent the original song to everybody. He was sending it to Santa Claus, to Jesus, and Chucky frickin' Thompson, an incomparable producer,

 cares enough about lil' ol 'me. Like, is this... like, I need to pinch myself. - Yeah, that was a good take. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, cool. - That was okay? That felt the better of the few. - Uh-huh. - It could be better, though. - Let's take a breath and a-a water break real quick, you know, man? - Yeah, okay. - That way, we can just come back strong and just break it up. - Okay. - Good job. - Thanks, babe. - Excellent work. - Thanks, guys. I love the energy in here. - Yeah. - Yes. - It's making me feel good. - See y'all in a few. - All right. How does it sound? - I like it better than the original. - You do? - But I think it's really cool that, you know, you have Chucky, of course, who is... is huge, kinda coaching you. - Literally, like, when we were in his office, I was, like, blown away at, like, Nas records, and Biggie records... - Well, yeah, he's... responsible for... - ...and Faith Evans Records sitting on his walls. I'm on, like, cloud 27, right now. This is where I wanna be, around people that support me. It's such a dichotomy from the shenanigans at the house from hell. - Hey. - Hey, what's going on? - Oh, so, she's invited to the conversation? - Mind... mind your business. - Candiace is woman enough to come to me last night about Michael's whereabouts and what he was allegedly doing on Thursday night. - This is, like, literally deja vu of last year, and then we do it again? - You're making a big deal. - All I said was, give me consideration. - Candiace! - You keep talking about it, and it's not a big deal. - You don't know how to consider other people. - Candiace! Candiace, come sit down - Everything is about what she wants to do on her terms. - Candiace! - I have settled on officially being done. Like done-done, with Monique. - Okay. - Like, she's plastic. It makes the most sense, right now, to take my mind off of all this mess because, if nothing else, I know that I've been a good friend to Monique. I know that I have. - You can always remove yourself from any situation that you're not comfortable with. - I'm just focusing on me. - Good. - Last night, Michael was at a strip club. - He has a boyfriend and a wife? He was asking who he can take to a hotel nearby? - If you'll follow me. - Thank you. - Thank you. I think I want some crab cakes. Uh, okay. I breastfeed. - Okay, babe. I'm not criticizing I'm just saying. - Can I get you started with something to drink? - May I have a, um, Pacifico, please? - Pacifico? - Yeah. - And for you? - Uh, I'm gonna do a Corona. - Corona, okay. - Last night, I'm sitting on the couch, and I'm pumping, and I get this text from Monique. It's this article, and then I get a text from Robyn, same article. Then I'm like... I know those underwear. - Thank you. - Would you like any appetizers? - Let's do the Brussels sprouts and let's also do a Caesar salad. I called my husband, and I said, "Get your ass home, right now." He walks through the door, sits down on the couch, and he tells me what happened. I was very, very, very upset, and I realize that I don't wanna be yelling with the baby being in the house, so that's why I wanted to sit down with him and really talk about it. Yeah. I feel, um, I'm just controlling my emotions a little better here. I'm glad you're telling me in a public setting because I don't know if my reaction would quite be the same. I never thought that we'd be having this conversation. - I didn't either. - I never thought that my husband of all people would be like this. I-I really thought that we were on the same page. - I should've told you. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I was worried when you were away with all those women. I'm worried what comes out without us discussing it. So, I wanted to wait until you were back and talked about it. - He met a girl at the strip club, and he and his guys went to MGM, and the girls came. - And one of the girls asked, "Do you want to go to a hotel?" They went upstairs into the hotel room. They kissed in the cab. Michael said, "I was so drunk. "I fell asleep, "and when I woke up, "she was laying in the bed next to me." Then when Michael gets out of bed to check the time, she snapped a picture of him from behind at the dresser... and gave it to a blog. The text that Candiace got saying things about how you have a boyfriend and a wife... Was there any truth to that? - No. - You have to... Yeah, I mean, you did not think anything about me. I was so far from your mind in that moment, so far... and so was Dean. You weren't even considering either of us. My God, baby. - I've been craving some of that, and I shouldn't be. - Craving some of it? - Not craving, just, honestly, I was waiting for that. - All right. So, on the one hand, you and I are not a very traditional couple. ...that's kind of the way that, you know, we have operated in the past. - Yeah, but I've always- always done it with you. - Right. - And that was a mistake. - And what if I tell you I don't wanna do that anymore? - Then we won't do that anymore. - Ever again. - But-but you and I have to be... - I'm telling you now, here-here and now. - You know that now. - Here and now. - The fun's over. - You have to tell me, now. And this... This would be the time for you to... For us to peacefully exit. - No. There's too much at stake. - I wouldn't... - We got a little three month old... Three month old baby. Honey, but we're not gonna stay together just for Dean. If I find out anything else, it will... It will be catastrophic for our relationship. - Can we cut now, please? Can someone get me another beer? You know what we just went through? - Yeah. - Okay. So, it's-it's a wrap. - All right. - I just told her something that's affected our relationship forever. - Yes, it will. - Yeah. - Okay? We've been truthful. Even when I've been accused of all kinds of sh..., we've been truthful, okay? - Yeah. All right. Well, I... well... And, uh... - It's our real life. - We're gonna take the microphones off and have... Yeah, I just don't think there's any more in me. I-I-I... - I never really wanted to have a talk about our business and what we've done in our personal life on camera. - All right. - Can I get a drink? - Good mornin'. Hey. - Hey, girl. - Oh, my God, it looks so good. This looks great. We have space to meet. Oh, my God. - It was necessary for me to obtain some type of office space, so that I can actually get some work done. Oh, my God, the chaos! It would be nice if some of the pressure is taken off of me as it pertains to our relationship. Not for Lazy Moms is a great lifestyle website, but now I wanna get the local, in person Not for Lazy Moms community built up. The live podcast is happening in about three weeks. - Mm-hmm. - Where are we with ticket sales? - So, right now, we're about 20 out of 300. It's still early, though. - Can we do, like, a couple giveaways on your social page, on Not for Lazy Moms, or you don't wanna? - Yeah, I can, but I'm just, like, I give so much for free. And I'm already at $80,000. - Oh, okay. - Like, between overhead for salaries and whatever we've been, you know, doing as far as, like, purchasing things. - Right. - We had such a good momentum going, but I was full-blown pregnant, and I had to take the time off, so it's gonna take a little bit of money to make a little bit of money. I'm meeting with my accountant next week, and she's gonna give me the whole rundown of how much I've spent, and then... - Is Chris going to that meeting? - Huh? - I feel like I don't want anybody at that meeting to know how much I've spent on this. - Oh, no, I'm like... He-he knows it's... yeah. So, if I can even just break even with these podcasts, the live events that we're doin', I would be happy with that. Karen will be there, and Ray is actually gonna make an appearance because I need to hear his perspective. They've been married for, like, 100 years. We wanna get down to the nitty gritty. - Right. - Oh, gosh. - When y'all are trying to get intimate. What happens? - PAUSE. - And then with Candiace and Chris, they've been married for a year and haven't even went on a honeymoon yet. I'm a little bit concerned that Candiace is gonna flop on me because she's upset. I wanna know how your honeymoon phase is going being that you ain't been one. But I hope that Candiace is actually big enough to come to somethin' that's important to me. I think it's gonna be good. - Me, too. - I think everybody will be able to take somethin' from this podcast. - Toast to that. - Yeah, let's toast to that. I'm speakin' that into existence. - Please. God is good. - All the time. - Hi. I'm kinda lookin' around. - Mm-hmm. - So, lighting... - Mm-hmm. - These-these lights are amazing. - Aren't they awesome? - I've never seen that before. Okay. - This is from Paris. - Gay Paree. - Of course. - Oh, I like that clock 'cause you could put that anywhere. I am getting ready to break ground on the west wing, and I want my house to be just, like, clean, and white, and blingy. I have a great decor style. Get with it. - Can I get you, while you're lookin' around, water, espresso, anything like that? - I would love a little water. - Okay, I'll be right back. Sure. - Yeah, all right. Oh, my friend! - Hi. Are-are these prescription glasses? - No, these are just... - They're fashion. - I thought... I thought I was cute. - Very cute. Hi. - Aww, thank you. Hi, hi, hi. - I miss you. Congratulations! - Did you... Literary awards winner. - Yeah. - Gizelle Bryant, "My World." - Thank you. I'm so excited. Sometimes my kids might eat Cheetos for dinner, but I have taught them that hard work pays off. Okay, so, are you getting some ideas? What's going on with the house? You haven't even looked? - Well, I haven't even... No, I haven't even begun to look. - Why? - If we're going to, like, actually buy a house, we have to get married. - Yeah, it's somethin' that I'm... I'm looking forward to doin'. - I mean, we've just been busy. - Okay. - We're gonna start lookin' soon, and, yeah, it's like I'm getting ideas. I want that dining room table in my dining room. - I know, if you get that dining room table, I'm coming over all the time. - I mean... What are you, like, lookin' for? - I'm lookin' for lighting and just, like, any knickknacks that I see. I really like this table. I like these. I wonder how much these cost. - This is $1,059. - Okay. All right. That's probably gonna bust the budget. - You just... yeah. - $2,500 in the hole. This is... this table's nice. - That table is gorgeous. 'Cause, um, your people were cuttin' up while you were gone. - What? - They were cutting the hell up. So, you know how the night before, y'all told Monique you had a surprise for her. - Yes, as we're trying to talk to Ashley and have a real girl talk. - Yeah. Well, she chose to make a fit over a damn fire pit. - Come on, Monique. What? - Like, to the point where Monique and Candiace's relationship is even worse. Monique pretty much turned it into, like, a whole, like, you know, Candiace being selfish type thing. - It was handled, and we came down. - It just could've been... It just could've been a heads up. - And then we came down. - That's all I was asking for was a heads up. - But we-we weren't going to give a heads up because it wasn't anybody's busins. - That's not... That's not that hard. - I'm sorry, Monique, but us telling Ashley about her allegedly cheating husband is more important than marshmallows and roasting them. - Yes. Right! - Did anyone get the articles while y'all were at the house? 'Cause everybody and their grandmother sent me a bunch of articles about Michael. - Right. - And him in boxers. - You know, later one, I was talking to Charrisse. She hadn't seen it. I was like, oh, okay. I'm like, let me send you this. - Right. - And I sent it. - Yeah. - So, I go into my text messages. I sent it to Ashley. - Oh, my God! Robyn, no! No! - I'm like, oh, sh...! So, I followed it up to her with, "What do you want us to do with this?" - Oh, okay, look at you. - I know. - Look at you fixin' the bad situation. I was very quick, right? Very quick. - Quick on your feet. I do feel horrible for Ashley. - I know. - 'Cause I know if I got 40 DMs of this article... - Right. - ...she probably got 140. Thank God me and Candiace talked to her when we did. She would've been totally blindsided. - That's true. - Whew. I need a drink. This is too much. Whew. Well, I-I think I'm... I need to get the ladies together. Um, I was thinking about having, like, a wine tasting. - Hmm. - Taking everybody out to a winery. - Oh, that would be nice. - Because, like, when you're at a winery, are you gonna act like a fool? No. Hopefully, you're gonna act... - Hopefully not. I'm sure all your friends, they missed you dearly. - Yes. - Get the stories all the way straight. - Yes, that's-that's my favorite thing to do. - Right. I mean, and drink some wine. - I think I'm gonna put this on my Christmas list. - Oh, you can tell Jamal, yeah. - I... yeah, I'll tell Jamal. Yeah, that's what I was thinking with this. Yes. - Okay. - Coming up next... - You ain't considering nobody but yourself. - I was trying to talk, but you just kept goin' on and on. - We're here, buddy. - Good. You've got it. Pull that left hand back. Take your right hand here. All right, we have a new friend in the house. Let me go introduce myself. You all take a quick break. How are you? - Eddie. - Stanley. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. I'm Wendy. So good to meet you. - Hi, Wendy. Nice to meet you. Is this Mr. Kruz? I've heard so much about you. Do you know why you're here? - Power Ranger training. - Yeah. - Okay, we'll see how close we can get to that. - I am winding down on my maternity leave from Johns Hopkins University, and I am so sad because it gave me time to be really present for my three babies, and it also gave me the time to focus on being a political commentator, somethin' that I'm so passionate about. There you go. Child, this is about to be a whole disaster. And now that I'm going back, I don't know if I can do both. I-I-I just don't know. I am so glad we did this for him. - I know. - Let's see. - He better not hurt my baby. - Mm-hmm. - Do it again. Good. So, you're trying to knock somebody out. I just want you to go straight through the target. - Oh. - I want you to show off your good punches, and then, Mr. Kruz, you can make your punches. - Chile, if he hit my baby one more time, I'm about to jump over this rail. Hop... Take your time. - Kruz was all chatty in the car today, so I didn't get to ask you... How was work today? - Work is cool. Work is busy. - Are you finding it hard to get back into the swing of things? Really? - Very hard. Very hard. I just enjoy the time with, uh, Kamrynn, with the boys, with you. - Right. - Punch, two more, cool. - So, you know, my maternity leave is over. I have yet to send an email to tell them I'm back. - All right. Probably need to do that. - I... what? - Probably need to think about doin' that. - I know. This cloud that has been lingering over me, which is, like, I don't know what to do next in my career, so I don't even know if teaching is for me. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. - But you're teaching at a top-notch academic institution, and you're not finding happiness in that. - All my life, I followed a roadmap of success. You're either a doctor or a lawyer. - Right. - And I followed that. - Right. - And I don't know if it's what I want. - Right. - Being a child of immigrants, a lot of my life I have chased the dreams of my parents because I know how much they sacrificed for me to be here. I just don't know if my mom is gonna be supportive. - Hmm. - I wanted to teach you Igbo to be able to communicate and have two different languages. How about we ask you because you... You're talking about you were born here. That's why you don't speak. - There's a lot of people like me. - Especially Nigerian mom, I just wanna make sure that I'm prepared for whatever she says, and I can stand on my own two regardless. My job and my career as a professor is my mom's pride and joy, and so walking away from my job is like telling my mom that all her sacrifice was for nothing. I'm struggling, right now. - Mommy, look. - Good, yeah, let her see. And. - Ha! - Oh! - Wow! - He's Power Ranger in training. I love it. Okay. - Yes, Kruz. - Oh, my God, this weather is crazy because it's, like, fall. And it's, like, 90 degrees. - Daddy long leg. - Where? - On the mailbox. - Oh, yeah. - I haven't seen one of them in a minute. - Really? I just took one out of the garage the other day. I was clearing it out, so I can put some Not for Lazy Moms, um, swag in there. - How is it doin'? - It's-it's doin'. - 'Cause I can tell you've been a little bit stressed lately, rippin' and runnin'. - Let me tell you. Like, I'm just a little nervous, right now. - Uh-huh. - Because I really need for these Not for Lazy Moms podcasts to really, like, be a hit. - Uh-huh. - And at this point, I've only sold 20 tickets... out of 300. - That's it? It seems like you're not gonna sell a whole lotta tickets. Maybe you cut back on all of the stuff that you normally would put into a party. That way, you can save some cost. - Okay. - Okay what? - I mean, if I'm gonna do it, it gotta be done. I don't wanna do what he's telling me to do. Leave me alone. I have a good foundation set up, which most of the infrastructure I've paid for. - Right. So, how much? - Okay, so, I've-I've spent close to $200,000. - Good Lord. What all you spend that on? That's a lotta money. - Uh, a lot of it was just, like, startup cost. - You know, it has to make sense. If you're not turning over, you done invested so much. - Right. - Eventually, you gotta shut it down. - Whoa, whoa, wait. I'm not shuttin' it down. I realize a lot of what I'm doin' is gonna be an investment, and I'm fine with the investment, but, you know, I need for you to, like, give me some support right about now. - I was trying to, like, talk, but you just kept goin' on and on. - This business, it's a different outlet for me. It's actually therapeutic for me. So, just because this baby didn't come out my vagina don't make it not my baby. What's wrong, poo-poo? Ugh! - Come on, big man. - You wanna go to daddy? Karen will be there, but, um, like, Candiace, I guess she has attitude with me. - For what? - I-I... listen. - I thought y'all worked everything out. - She dropped out from bein' a part of the live podcast. She's so darn unprofessional. Selfish people don't think about the other end. Now, I gotta call my graphic team to make new fliers, and then I have to pay additional money, a few hundred dollars, to get all new fliers printed up because I literally had, like, 500 fliers printed up with her face on it, but it's fine. The topic is, the honeymoon phase is over, and her and Chris ain't even been on a honeymoon. - That's shady. - Pfft. Well, it's true. - You know, I'm... I have no reason to be a part of the Not for Lazy Moms podcast when Monique can't even just say bye to me before I leave. - All right. I'll see you later. Yeah, enjoyed it. Yeah. - Thank you. The more I look at you, the more I see who you really are, and it's disappointing. - What we got, is gonna be very superficial, but you know what? - I hope you and Candiace get it together. - But wait. - I like Candiace and Chris. - I'm done with trying. - Coming up next... - Make sure that this man knows... - Mm-hmm. - There are consequences when you make these kinda mistakes. - I'm not afraid to leave Michael. - This is like it. - Yes. - Hello! - Oh, all right. All right. All right. How ya doin'? - I'm good. You good? - Okay. What brings this surprise? - I wasn't far, so I thought I would stop in. - Oh, a due drop in. - How was your day? - Busy. - Busy? - Mm-hmm. - Well, I'm just filling out some things for our... You know, we got a couple of gigs coming up, you know? - Music superstar. - Yeah, well, workin' on it. - Yeah. My father's a retired dentist, as well as a jazz musician, and my mom is a retired professor. When my parents met Juan, and they found out that his parents were deceased by the time he was 15 years old, instantly, they treated him like a son, and I see them as an example for what a family and a marriage really looks like. - So, anyway. - Let me see the... - My tattoo? - Yes. They didn't do a good job down there. - No. Aww... happily ever after. Tattoos on the finger fade quickly and easily. - As long as the love and the relationship doesn't fade. - True. So, reality didn't really hit me until recently that we're outgrowing our house, but if we're going to purchase a home, we should probably be married. - Uh... - Oh. - Okay. I don't... I don't know. - Why not? - That's something you have to think hard about. - I mean... - It's about time. - My mom really loves Juan, so I know for her to hear we're finally talking about marriage, I know that makes her really happy, but my father, he just doesn't wanna repeat the mistakes of the past. - I think the kids would love it, but I think if there is anything on your mind or his mind... - Right. - That-that need to be put out in front. Right before you do that, you have both of you, I guess, in a way, sign off on it. - So, I... - And one of... One of the things... One of the things I said, I think... I think... I told Juan this sometime before that he would have to acknowledge there are some things that mean a lot to you that you would like his presence. - Right. - You know, and it can't always be the other way around. That's the tradeoff. - You're right, and I actually mentioned to Juan, I said, "I do want to actually go to maybe some sort of marital or couples counseling or something 'cause we never did that before we got married the first time. Therapy may help Juan and I improve our communication and just, you know, address issues head-on. I don't wanna go into marriage with lingering issues. - Give it another shot. - Right. - But, uh, I don't know. I don't have any money for-for wedding presents. I can tell you that, right now. - I love this store. So, this lady, Katherine, she has some great dresses. - Hello. - Hello, my dear. - How are you? - Hi, sweetheart. - Aww, good to see you. - Oh, it's so good to see you. - This is my mom, Sheila. - Hi, Sheila. - Hi. Very nice to meet you. - It's so nice to meet you. - And baby Dean. - Oh, my goodness, Dean, look at you, baby. You are so sweet. - Isn't he precious? - Oh, my gosh. - And this is my sister, Jessica. - Jessica, hi, sweetie. - Hi. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - She's lady of the hour because it's her homecoming. - All right. Okay. - Mm-hmm. So, we're looking for some options. - Take care of her. Okay. - I wanted her to wear a gown, but, apparently, that's not what you wear for homecoming. - No. - No. - Not unless you have a date, no. - You don't have a date? - I don't want one. - Okay, girl, you don't want one. - Right? - That is great. Jessica and I have different dads. I was 16 when she was born. Even though we are so far apart in age, I can still relate to her, which I think that means that I'm still cool. Her dad is my mom's partner. Michael does feel like we are taking care of this cancerous individual. - You want me to just, like... ...Snap my fingers, and be done with this relationship. - And even though he and I don't see eye-to-eye on a lot of things, that is the best gift he could've ever given me, is my sister. - I'm kinda looking for, like, a formfitting dress. - How short? - Short? - How short? - Um, like, here. - Oh, I feel like an ankle length. - We might have somethin' in between. - Cute. This is very boho chic. I like that. What do you think? That is really cute. - It's not my style. - I have it in blue. - How about... how about we take a look around a little bit more. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Yes, look around and let me know, okay? - Do your thing, baby girl. - Yes, get in there. - Let's see. - How are you, mommy? How are you doing? - I'm doing good, but you've been goin' through a lot. Like, I got a lot on my shoulders, too. - Right. What? - Yeah. - Mom, really? - Yeah. - All right. Here, we can take this off, now. I think he'll be warm. - Oh, what, baby? - In his mimi outfit with his skinny jeans on. - Oh. Yeah, 'cause this whole situation has been laying heavy on me, too. Like, I'm ang... I got... I'm angry. - You're angry at Michael? - Yeah. - Oh. - Very angry. - Okay. Okay, I hear you. Mm-hmm. - Make sure that this man knows... - Mm-hmm. - That there are consequences when you make these kinda mistakes. - Mm-hmm. - 'Cause I want to... So I wanted to get this out while Jessi's not here, but... - Mommy's little tink-tink. - Like, I'm just so mad that he has everything. This man has a beautiful wife, a beautiful son. He has everything in the world he could possibly ask for. This stuff has to, like, this is, like, it. - Yes, yes, this is... This is one-one, two, and three strikes in one. I, um, I'm not afraid to leave Michael. I want you to know that. I've left him before. - He needs to learn how to move forward. I mean, he needs to not continue to fall back, you know, into his old ways. - He does, and he knows this is it. - Absolutely. - Come on out, darlin'. Let me make this... - Ooh! - Ooh, Jessica! - This one I like a lot. Does this have everything you're asking for? - Still not... Still not a homecoming dress. - What kinda dress is this? Yeah, it's short and stuff, short. - Oh. - Uh-uh, girl. - Look, she's tightening the bottom. - Yeah. So, she wants it to be like that short. - Un-uh. Un-uh, mom. I practically see her... No, un-uh. - I know, Jessi. - What? - This is perfect just like this. - No. - Coming up next... - It's about not having a conversation with somebody that can't have a conversation. - Anyway. - And then she calls you, and you invite her out. - Let's move on. - Or she invites you out. - No, she doesn't 'cause she's never sorry. - Oh, wow. Hi. - Hi. - This is so nice. - Yes. - I feel bad a little bit that I left witness protection a little early. Can you hear me now? Monique has me in the freakin' sticks. - Hello. You're frozen. - It's Mommy. Hello. - So, I do wanna get the ladies together, so they can celebrate me. Yep, it's about me and my literary award. I am the worst. - Hello, hello. - Oh, hi. - Oh, my goodness, hello. - Hello. - Hi. - This is so cute. It's so very, like, Newburg-ish. It's like... What's up, girly? - How are you? - I'm good.

Wanna toast, ladies? - Cheers, cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers to you winning your award. - Congratulations. - Yes, my literary. - Yes, yes. - Thank you, Karen. - Yes. - Oh, my God. So, it had to be exciting, though? - Yeah. - No, yes, totally. So, I was, like, very nervous. - Yeah. - And I was sitting there, and I was, like, if I don't win, this is embarrassing, and how fast do I leave? Like... - Oh, stop! But the fact that you were nominated, like, that's a lot. - Right! - Yeah, but still, but once you're there... - There's a lot of authors out there. - Yes. - But once you're there, be real. You wanna win. - But somebody has to win. Only one person... - You wanna win! - She is doing well with the book that she wrote about her cheating ex-husband, whohe is now dating. Is that gonna be part two? - Hola. - Hey. - What's happening? - What's going on? - Oh, my God. - Hi. Muah. - Yes. I have been. Muah. - How ya doin'? How ya doin'? - Hi. - I'm loving it. - I like it. Yeah, it looks good. - Is Ashley coming, too? Do you know? - You're not a friend. I'm here for my other friends. There's nothing I need to say to Monique. - If I could have your attention, our friend is coming. - Is this the entire group we have here, now? - Well, we're missing one, but it's okay. We'll catch her up when she comes. - Okay, excellent. - Yes. - That works for me. Welcome to the winery. - Thank you. - We're very happy to have you guys here. - Now, which one? Is this apple cider? - No. So, this is our sun gold. - Okay. - So, this is an orange wine. - Orange wine? - So, these are very popular wine, right now. - I love that. I've never heard of that. - It's a white wine made like a red wine. So, I'm happy for y'all to try it and let me know what yo think. - I gotta finish this one. - It's really good. - Cheers. - This is good. - Well, this one has the after taste like a Moscato. - Right. - Y'all are some drinkers 'cause this right here... - Really? - What? - That's because you're still breastfeeding. - Maybe. - Your... you... your tolerance ain't there yet. - Hi, friends. - She made it. - It's so cold. - She come in here like Little Red Riding Hood. - How is my lady of the... Of the moment? - Thank you. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. You look great. - We were trying to wait for you, but we you're not... - No. - You're not drinking white anyway, and we haven't gotten to the red yet. - Okay, okay, good stuff. - Me and you both. Me and you both. - I appreciate you all coming to celebrate me. Literary award winner is what I would like to be called from here on out. - Oh, Lord. Hi, Gizelle. - Lit-literary award winner. - Gizelle's hosting skills suck. We are standing around in a circle doing absolutely nothing. I just think she wants to talk about her literary award. - Is there some food coming? I'm so hungry. - All right. - I wish she had Skyped me. I coulda saved the gas. - Are you drinking? - I'll have a little glass. Yes. - You'll have a little glass. Great. - Yes. - So, my friend is here. So, since she's only gonna have one, so let's pick the best one for you. - Yes, one red... one red. - She likes the reds. - Okay, excellent. Here, let me give you a glass. - Okay. - Yes. She-she just pushed out a baby, and she needs to govern herself accordingly. - Congratulations. - And I... And so, I am, like, feeling a little off-center these days, and I know, like, it's very hard to conceive when you're breastfeeding but, like... - What? - What? - Pregnant? - I'm like, could I? Maybe. - Once again, the politician Ashley walks in, and everything is good in the hood. So, we gotta keep it movin'. - All must be well in the Michael world if we think we pregnant. I'm sorry. Yes. - Well, I don't wanna make it about me. - No, it's-it's fine. - Um, first off, congratulations. - 'Cause I'll bring it back to me at any time. Yeah. - And we-we know that you're very good at that. Um, obviously, there has been a lot going on in the presabout... Or that's been circulating about Michael and me. Um, as Michael has told me, yes, there is truth to what was said. - Well, sh... - Okay. - Um, but, yeah, uh, I told him, and he... - So, when he... So, when he said... - Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Pick me. - Okay, wait. - One at a time. - Can you pick me? - One at a time. - Right here. Right here. - Wait a minute. You told... - One at a time. - Wait, wait, wait. - Pick me. Can you pick me? - Yes. - Can you pick me? - Yes, yes. - That was my question. - Okay, well, what is that truth? - Michael went to the strip club. While they were at the strip club, I guess he told everybody that he was going to be going to MGM. They came. - The strpers? - These women that played him. - A stripper. - Okay. - And one of these women said, "Do you wanna go have some fun in a hotel?" And he took the bait. He said that he was so drunk that he laid down. - Okay. - And went to sleep, passed out. - Okay. - So, then the next morning, while he was looking at his phone, she snaps the photo. - So, that really was him standing there. - That really was Michael. Ashley is a tough cookie, but none of us are really buying that it doesn't hurt. I've put on my tough face and my big girl britches when I had to, too. Girl, I got you on this one. - I'm-I'm confused. So, he-he went to the hotel, but he did not have sex with this woman. - Correct. - And you believe that? - I do. - I'm not believing one word that Michael says. Where's the sex tape, though? - Sis, no. Have you seen Michael? Who is cuddlin' with that? - Why do you believe him? - 'Cause I just don't know why he would be lying, at this point. I mean, he's... - So that you don't get mad. - Right. - No, but he knows if he's lying, and those things come out, and it further proves that he lied to me, again, the consequences would be so much worse. - You don't think he's just giving you enough truth where you won't run out the door? - Yeah. - You know, this is how I'm lookin' at it. - Okay. - By the time he told you, that article had already been posted seven hours by the time I texted you that it was actually on Twitter. - Okay, I didn't know that. - So, did he only tell you because he knew that it was out there? - Perhaps. - Do you think that's a possibility? - There's so much potential. Honestly, ugh, there are a lot of things. The reality is, my marriage has had its own identity, we'll say, and I have... Michael and I have been in situations where we've been with other people before. - The reality is, my marriage has had its own identity, we'll say, and I have... Michael and I have been in situations where we've been with other people before. - Wow. - Like, with? - For example, we were, like, hanging out at the David Guetta concert, and, you know, I saw someone I was attracted to and... - Oh, it was a threesome. - Oh, together. Okay. - Yes. - Okay. - With-with... - We... - Whoa. That... You had a threesome. - Hold-hold-hold on. - People do that. - No, no, no. It was a girl. - Oh. - I appreciate Ashley talking to us, but we already filled in the blanks. I know I had, and I'm okay with it. Duh! Are you in a monogamous place, right now, Ashley? - Yes. - 'Cause I get that feeling that you are. - I-I even don't want... I don't want anything with anybody else. - Okay. - So, if somethin' like this happens again... - Well... - No, real question. - No, that's... that... it... - If some... if somethin' like this happens again, where are you? - We are done. - Okay. - Yeah. - This is your marriage. You have to make the best decision for yourself and then, ultimately, baby Dean because it has to be genuine. - Ooh, cheers, everybody. - Cheers. - And I know that I have... I've had strong opinions about everybody in the group, and-and I've voiced my stuff, and so the fact that y'all are being supportive to me, uh, you don't have to be, and I appreciate that you are. You're mature women. Like, you 'bout about it. - Yeah. Marriage isn't easy. - Yeah. - It's not. - All right. So, um, thank y'all for comin' out. - I love you guys. - Aww. After you had some wine. - I love you all. - That's what it takes, after some wine. - Are you guys good? - It's expected. - Who? - You guys... You guys are good since the lake house? You-you... - Listen, listen. - Yeah. - We're where we are. - Okay. - Cancellations happen, and then you live with cancellations. - Wait, wait, wait. Wendy wants to make a toast. - Sure. - Then we gotta go home. - Oh, I'm meeting her where she at, and that's back there. - But back there is not the good place. - What's the issue? - What I said was true, I love... I love Monique. - When a conversation can be had, it will be had. - You love Monique. - Listen. Where's the knife? - But it's not ready yet. - You love Monique? - I love Monique. - I can have a conversation any time, but it ain't ready. - I love Monique. - Why don't you tell her? - Even when Monique petends to be asleep when I'm about to leave, I love her. - What? When I pretend to be asleep? I'm always awake. - Girl, was you asleep? - I'm always woke. - Was you asleep? - I'm always woke. - You were asleep, though. - All right. I'll see you later. Yeah, enjoyed it. Yeah. - Thank you. You was, like, sleep... In quotes. - Oh, at the... At your lake house. - What are you talking about? Um, do y'all not understand what I went through? Well, you wouldn't understand. You ain't got kids, so just whatever. - Mom shaming... mom shaming. - How is it mom shaming when you're not a mom? If you had kids, and you know what I went through to get the house ready... - That was my perception. That was my perception. - You would know that I was asleep because I was tired. - That was my perception. I appreciate... - You don't. Y just said that I was pretending to be asleep. - I appreciate all that you did to care. - Why would I pretend? Why would I pretend to be asleep? - I'm holding my wine. - That makes no sense. That's bull. - All you did to care for your guests in your home... - Whatever-whatever her thoughts are towards me, are her thoughts. - But don't mom shame me 'cause I don't have kids. - Nobody else knows what those are. Whatever. Just ask. Were you really asleep? Were you really tried? - Why would you shame me? - It's no issue. It's about not havin' a conversation with somebody that have... Can't have a conversation. - But y'all-y'all had a big friendship. - No, we didn't. It was a facade. It was a facade of a friendship. - Because we had many conversations before your dinner, as I said to you, and she never mentioned to me ever, never, ever that she had a problem. Anyway, let's... Let's move on. No, she doesn't 'cause she's never sorry. - Okay, no knives for you. No knives for you. - 'Cause she's never, ever in life said you've never... I'll talk to you. You never acted like you had a problem with me. - All of a sudden, Monique gets an audience. - I heard that when Candiace and Monique had their fallout, Candiace made a huge effort to become friends with Charrisse. - The plot thickens. - Yes. - The word on the street is, Monique and her trainer were a wee bit... too close for comfort, and big boy found out, and Charrisse has told people. I'm sure that will all be exposed and revealed. - Yes, child. - Candiace and Monique comin' for each other's neck has everything to do with Charrisse and everything to do with the trainer. - Monique wants to... Oh, my God... I'm upset and I'm sad. - You can twirl around and do all of that. - Because you don't wanna talk to me. - Go ahead and twirl around. Keep spinnin'. - And you're not my friend. - We'll throw you dollars in a second. - Bah, bah, bah, bah. - We'll throw you whole dollars in a second. - And I don't have time for that, girl. I'm bored. - Don't... Keep spinnin' around. Keep spinnin'. - I'm bored. I'm asleep. - I'm bored watchinyou. Spin around. - I'm asleep. I'm asleep. - Come on, leopard. Come on. What's that? Leopard? Chia-chia pet? Go ahead. - I'm asleep. I'm asleep. I'm asleep. I'm asleep. - Keep spinnin'. Go ahead. - It's more than you, girl. - All right. - And I'm asleep 'cause I'm bored 'cause you're mad. - Yes, go ahead. - 'Cause you're making up sh... That don't make no damn sense. - Ain't nobody make up nothin'. Ain't nobody even say nothin'. - Good night. Good night. - You're the only one. Good night. You can go on. - Good night. Good night. - Get your hand out of my face. - Good night. Your hand is in my face. - Get your hand out of my face. You put your hand in my face first. - Okay. - You gonna drag me? You gonna drag me? - You want me to? - Rag me. - Do you want me to? - Drag me. Drag me. - Do you want me to? - Drag me. Drag me. - Do you want me to? - No! - Hey! Hey! Hey! - Let her go, Monique!
