I mean, she's a stalker. - She-she is. - And you can tell her I said it. - Yeah. - Okay. - Be a little helpful. - This is serious business. - What's crackin'? - Candiace shared some information with me out of respect for you. - Okay. - Because she respects y'all's relationship and where y'all are, right now. - Okay. - And I want us to stay in this good place. - Yes. - Okay. Okay, let's get to it. What is it? - Okay, yes. - Okay.

"he was in there to several strippers." okay. "I got her to pretend she was taking a selfie "and take his pic. "he was talking about he has a boyfriend and a wife." "he was asking who he can take to a hotel nearby." ♪♪ - they need to come on. - I just don't want them to miss out on this. - Today, candiace received a very strange text from one of her friends. - It starts right there, and you can just go... Scroll down. - Okay. What? "he has a boyfriend and a wife. "he was asking who he can take to a hotel nearby." what? So, this person is a credible source? - Yes, this is a friend of mine who I've known for years. - Okay. - And we didn't want you going home and not knowing this 'cause it's kinda like, you know, if he did not tell the truth, if he wasn't honest with you, you need to know. - Right. As far as I know, everything is well, so that's why it's, like, a little, you know... - Yeah. - I'm-I'm shocked and... - I know you ask, like, direct questions, but do you ask, like, indirect questions? - I don't just ask questions, candiace. I read emails, text messages. I sniff underwear, everything. [laughing] I swear to god. - You've never said that before, ever. - I have, since I've met him. - That you were super sleuth. - Yes. You know, one time, he did come home smelling like perfume, and I was upset. - Oh. - Hmm. - And he was like, "I'm sorry. "I was at the strip club," and this was when I was pregnant, and I was very sensitive. - Mm-hmm. - And I was like, "please don't do that." - mm-hmm. - So, he stopped going to strip clubs while I was pregnant. - This is, like, recent. - Yeah. - Okay. - So, I will take this information. - Okay. - I hear what you're saying. - Yeah. - Yes. - I will... I will talk to my husband about it. I will get to the bottom of it and see if there's some truth to it. - Yes. - And you don't even have to report back to me. I don't even need to know. - Right. You don't have to report back. We're not reporting to the group. - I just... I'm not telling the gro anything. - Yes. - This doesn't feel like a shock to her. Are you used to it? Like, is... This is what y'all do? Like, what? That's-that's what it makes me think. - And them hoes outside at the fire pit, they don't need to know. - Yeah, no. [laughing] - okay. - Yes. - All right. - Okay, and your girl has your back. - I appreciate that a lot, candiace. - Yes. - Given our history and everything. - Yeah. - And the fact that you decided approach this, this way, like, I really have a lot respect for you. - Thank you. Well, I have a lot of respect for you. - I'm so glad we've- we've grown. - Thank you. We have. - Yeah. - Yes. - Yeah. - Thank you. Candiace knows that I am a new mom and the things that I'm going through with postpartum and with my marriage. Are we going down to the fire pit? - Yes. Okay, I'll walk around. - So, I do think her intentions are good. Ultimately, I do. - Wendy, don't take this the wrong way. - Yeah. - I thought you were older than me. It's not looks, obviously, 'cause black don't crack. - I know what... I know what you're sayin'. - It's your maturity level. - Really? - It's your acc- accomplishments. - I get that often. [cork pops] - cheers. [laughing] - cheers. - Monique said that by the fire it's, like, really, warm. - Yeah, that makes sense. - Whoo! It's cold! - Oh, y'all decided to join us, now. - Oh, monique, stop being jealous. - After we've been slaving over this fire, gettin' it nice and warm. - Is this safe? Is this safe? - And gizelle? Gizelle? - Yes. - You left your girl out. - Who? - Robyn. - Robyn is grown, now. - What you mean, you left your girl out? - She can... she... - Now? I'm grown, now? - No, I mean grown. Period. - Come on, robyn. Come on, now. Come on. - She's grown, now. - We were planning something for monique, if y'all really wanna know. - Oh, y'all are planning something for me?

Yo, karen, what the hell? - Thanks, karen. - I'm not... no. [laughing] - no, I'm gonna tell you something. Being grown at 56, when you marry a powerfully success man... Successful man... Let me do it again-again, so you get it right. When you marry a powerfully successful man, let's be very clear. When you do business, be legitimate. - That's right. - And ray, he put burdens on me that I don't need to have, and it is wearing on our marriage. You know, I-I held him down. I put half my money behind him to save us after the tax issues. - I didn't know, uh, that some of the tax matters were accumulating like they did. - Girl, I want my money back. I need a return. - But, karen... - I need a return. [laughing] I'm proud of myself. I-I-I woulda left in a... in' heartbeat. - Yeah. - But I'm married to ray. You know what? When you are drunk, you speak your truth, and I've been praying for it, and I love the both of you, that you guys will wake up and be okay with each other. Are you really okay with each other? - Why are we getting... I don't want no deep conversations. I just wanna, like, have some shots, and have fun, and kiki, and all of that, and then we can save that for another time. - I respect. Candiace? All right. I bow out. Good. To friendship. - Cheers. - Friendship. - We're toasting to... - Wise pussies. [laughing] [bell dings] - coming up next... - This is monique. No, I'm playin'.

I cannot wait to go home. - Hello. Good morning. - Girl, I don't even know how you're awake, right now. Y'all-y'all... I mean, whoa, watch out. Watch out. Yeah, hand down. There you go.

Hope y'all are enjoying yourself. - We are. - Yes, very much. - What's up, baby? I'm starting to under-understand t'challa's language. He makes certain chirps for certain things. So, when he does this... - I don't believe all this, man. - No, I'm telling you. When he does bap-bap-bap, he wants me to scratch his neck. - Monique, bap-bap-bap doesn't mean scratch my neck. - I'm telling you! He-he... it's his language. He's so smart. Yeah. Say, 'hi, daddy." who's that? - Got a hair on you, right there. What the hell. He done bit at me. - He said, "don't touch her. "she's mine." that's not nice. - All right. So, what's up? Every-every... How everybody doin'? Like, everybody gettin' along, havin' fun? - Oh. We were up 'til, like, 3 somethin'. - Oh, really? - Yes. I'm not young anymore. Like, I just can't go non-stop. - Oh, you are young. - No, no, I'll be 36 tomorrow. - I know. - So, everybody is comin' out. All the guys are comin' out except for michael. - Well, maybe I'll reach out to him and call him and check on him. - Yeah, hit him up. Hit him up. - Yeah. [birds chirping] - good morning! Oh, it's just you all. Hi. - Hi. - What up? - What's up, girlie? - Hope you're havin' a good time out here. - Good morning. I am. I am. - It's good-good to see ya. - Country living. - Yeah. - She don't... they don't like being put to work. [ughing] - un-uh. - Oh, yeah, 'cause you're from baltimore, right? - Right. [laughing] - so, you ain't used to this type stuff. - Yeah, I don't do this. - This co... this alabama style, right re. - Yes. - I don't do this. - So, juan comin'? - No. They have a, um... he's got a football game to coach. - What's up? Good morning. - Hey, baby. - Good morning. - Do we have... ooh, I see it. - Everything bagel. - Look at the beautiful little baby. - Little pumpkin man. - Yeah, he's definitely sleepy. - Yeah. - Aww. Oh, he's ready to eat. - Yeah. - Want me to feed him? - Eve's gonna put him to sleep, too. - Oh, okay, cool. - Yeah. - Somebody can sit here. I'm going to go sit in here and kick it. - So, gizelle is gone? She headed on out? - Yeah. - Yeah, I figured we missed her. - Yeah. - Was she nervous or anything? Like, any... - Oh, she's excited. - She was. - Right. You know, like, last night with the fire pit. We're sittin' outside waiting, and y'all sat in here for, like, a whole hour while we're sittin' out there, talkin' about whatever y'all talkin' about. - Okay. Can... - I don't disrespect people in that way when I go on the... On-on y'all trips. - Let me just tell you. That conversation last night, so candiace... - I'm gonna... well, but I want you to know that it was... - the whole issue is just tell me, like, we just needed to have a private talk. - Okay. So, what happened, candiace was very respectful. She was woman enough to come to me last night. Her friend had sent her this information about michael's whereabouts and what he was allegedly doing on Thursday night. - Haven't we been down this road before? Like, when are we gonna wake up and realize that certain roads aren't good to go down and just leave it alone? - What are you talking about? - I mean, this is, like, literally deja vu of last year. We saw that that didn't work, and then we do it, again. - What didn't work? Well, we're not, which is why I wanted to have the conversation privately. I apologize if you feel like we were sequestering ourselves. And I told you... [clears throat] I told you last night, and I'll say it, again. Whatever the conclusion is, is your business. - We all hear things all the time. It doesn't need to be always just put out there. Like, I'm sick of people attacking marriages. Like, leave people's marriages alone. There is a pattern that I notice with candiace. You were being messy when you invited charrisse to your anniversary party. - You got it goin' on. - I tried. - I'm lovin' it. - Who was clearly comin' after my family and my marriage. - The word on the street is, monique and her trainer were a wee bit too close for comfort, and big boy found out, and charrisse has told people. When did candiace and charrisse become cool? - I have no-no idea. - A.... B., why would she do that to you? - Stay out of people's marriages. Mind your own. - I don't think anyone should come down on candiace for bringing it up, for talking about it. When people receive information like that, sometimes it can be stressful, and it's an uncomfortable position for the messenger or the receiver to be in. - And she could've been shady, and she chose not to. - Let's not go down to the road of why are we talking about it. - I think, in this situation, candiace was sincere, but monique doesn't want people to be gossiping about people because she don't want people to gossip about her own marriage. - Coming up next... - What are you talking about, robyn? Your delivery sucks. And I'll say it, again. Whatever the conclusion is, is your business. - If you want to soldier for michael, I got you. And I don't want to know more unless you want to talk to me. - Okay? - Okay. - All right. We're good. - Thank you. - And I need to take a bath. - Take a bath, girl. - And I love you guys, but ray is comin', and my cootchie stinks. [laughing] - oh! ♪♪ [knocking] - what up? - Hey, what's goin' on, man? - You doin' all right? - I'm good. How are you? - Come on in. - Yeah, I appreciate it. - Look what I done found. - Hey, baby! - How are you? - Y'all do your thing. I'ma feed him. - Okay. I love you. - Hi! - How are you? Oh, hey, chris. What's goin' on? - Chillin'. - How-how you doin'? - Hey. - You're not dressed today? - I was cold. - What's goin' on, man? - Chillin'. - Chile, y'all have worn me out this weekend. - Oh, no. - Last night, after we went to the fire pit, we went downstairs to the bar. We came down there with a bottle of fireball. - Uh-huh. - When the night was over, the bottle is done. - Oh, sh... Was karen drunk? - Chile... [laughing] baby! - How are you doin'? - Aww, I missed you. Aww. - Did you really, now? - I really did. - Aww. It's good to see you. - I love you. - You're still in one piece, huh? - I'm still in one piece. - All right, now. - You got your mr. Rogers outfit on. Let me ask you this, eddie. Is wendy good at apologizing when she's wrong? - No. - Okay, that's good to know. - She's never wrong, though. Boom. You see... You see how I brought it? - Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. You went full circle. Oh! - See how I... see how I came back around? Yeah, you saw it. ♪♪ - while I really would like to hang out with everybody, I'm feeling a little bit anxious. Last year was a really trying time for our marriage, and this text message and these rumors... I don't want that to be a thing. - Hey, hey. - Hi, there. - Good to see you. - You look so nice. - Well, thank you. Thank you. - Nice sweater action. - Appreciate it. - Yeah. - How's it goin', man? - What's up, man? How ya been? - Good, good. How are you? - Good to see you, again. What'd I miss out here? - It was good. - It was good. - Yeah. - Ahh, shoot. - Wait a minute. - Chris! Hey. - Hi, karen. How are you? Good to see you. - Fine. How are you? - Good to see you, again. - Good to see you. - Hey, karen. - Did you get somethin' to drink yet? - Yeah, I think it had alcohol in it. - Oh, yeah. I-I need one of those. - We should-I should show... I should show you where it's at. - Yeah, please do. - What are you talking about, robyn? - Y'all want a danish? - Ooh. - You made this? - I didn't make 'em by scratch. I just put 'em in the oven and put some icing on 'em. [laughing] - thank you. - They're really, really good. - All right. Let them do what they do. We got man time in here. - That's right, man time. - Got some good football on tv. Got some alcohol. - What y'all down here talkin' about? - Our kiki moment last night. - It was girl power. - Oh, my god. - Yes, it was fun. - I would like a-a bonfire in my backyard, now. - Same. - Oh, yeah. - That is so cool. - I love it. - And that's why I was so adamant about the firepit situation. Like, when I had somethin' planned and laid out... - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - Give me the same courtesy that I give when we go on group retreats, and-and things are planned and laid out. - And I-I hear you, and, for the most part, this whole weekend, we have followed your lead. - For the most part but not all the part. - I did apologize to you for pulling some of the group away from a special moment that you wanted to have. - I just didn't like being lied to. - But this was a special circumstance. It was handled, and we came down. - It just could've been... It just could've been a heads up. - And we came down. - That's all I was asking for was a heads up. - We-we weren't going to give up a heads up. - That's not... That's not that hard. - Because it wasn't anybody else's business. - I'm gonna see my husband. - Mm-hmm. - And y'all didn't spend ten minutes. - I know he's here by now. - It was over an hour. What type of person do y'all think I am? - The kind that's going... - Where I'm gonna say, "what is it that you're gonna talk about?" - that's what you would've done. - No, that's not what I would've done. - That is what you would've done. - If you think that I would've donehat, then you know nothin' about me at all. - Well, monique, you're-you're doing it, right now. - No, I'm not. - You're-you're making it a big deal. - I don't... I just said that it's not a bg eal about what y'all were talking about. - I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm not arguing with you. - But you can give the consideration of saying, "hey, this is the heads up." - I'm not arguing with you. I'm not arguing. - "we got somethin' that we"... That's fine. - You wanna fight? Fight by yourself. - You're literally sittin' here making a bigger deal out of somethin'. All I said was, give me consideration. - You're making a big deal! - Candiace! - You keep talking about it, and it's not a big deal. - You don't know how to... You don't know how to consir other people. - Candiace! Candiace, come sit down! - Everything is about what she wants to do on her terms. - No, monique... - Candiace! But candiace said she was sorry. - No, it's-it's about being considerate. - But she said she was sorry. - It's about being considerate. - But she said sorry. - But, monique, can you take a step back? - Monique... - And, like, you're honestly trying to... It-it sounds like you want to control everything that took place here. - No. - The situation. - Okay, so, if you... - But not just that. But not just that. But not just that. - That was... that...
