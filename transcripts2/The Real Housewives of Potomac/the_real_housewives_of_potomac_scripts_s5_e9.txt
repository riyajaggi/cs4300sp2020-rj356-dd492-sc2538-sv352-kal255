 since you won't say the three words to me. - "Okay, okay, okay?" - Okay is the not the three words. - Everybody and their grandmother sent me a bunch of articles about Michael. - Right. I was drunk at the casino and... ...a girl came up to me and we ended up... - Going back to a hotel. - I'm sorry. You did what? - Hello. - Hey. - What's happening? - What's goin' on? - Oh, my God, hi. - Hi. Muah. - Yes, there has been.

 Cheers! - There is truth to what was said in the press. Michael and I have been in situations where we've been with other people before. - I feel like a lot of what happened was a lot of misunderstandings. - I think so. I wish that I would have called you. - I miss you. - Yes, yes. - Candiace was woman enough to come to me last night about Michael's whereabouts and what he was allegedly doing on Thursday night. - When are we gonna wake up and realize, like, leave people's marriages alone? I'm-I'm-I'm... - It's not a big deal about what y'all were talking about. - I'm not arguing with you. I'm not arguing with you. - But you can give the consideration of saying... - I'm not arguing with you about this. - "Hey, this is the heads up. We got somethin' that we..." - I'm notrguing. - That's fine. - You wanna fight? Fight by yourself. - You're literally sittin' here makin' a bigger deal out of somethin'. All I... - You're makin' a big deal! - Are we good bween Candiace and Monique? - It is what it is. - I'm meetin' her where she at, and that's back there. - I love Monique. - But it ain't ready yet. - Even when Monique pretends to be asleep when I'm about to leave. - All right. I'll see you later, yeah? - Thank you. - As I told Chris, I said me and Chris is always gonna be partners. - Well, you wouldn't understand. You ain't got kids, so just whatever. - Mom shaming. Mom shaming! - How is mom shaming when you're not a mom? - It's no issue. - It is what it is. Goodnight.

What the just happened? - Is my wig on? - Yeah, yeah, you're-you're on. - The hood rat came out. - Okay, okay. - Where's Monique? - You keep talkin'... - You're all right. - You literally want somebody to hit you. So, that's what happened. What is it, wine on my face? - Ooh. - Did she hit me in the face with a glass? - Let me get the emergency kit. - Just come over here for a minute. - Okay. - Just come over away from... - I'm-I'm-I'm fine. - I know. - "You gonna drag me?" Now, you-you-you beg... You baitin' me, so you want me to. So, I'm like get your... Get your hand outta my face. I start flickin' her hair. - Yeah. - And then, honestly, I don't even know what happened after that. - She obviously was very upset. - It wasn't the right time to push this conversation. - She got a problem. - Let's not throw her under the bus. - I'm not throwin' her under the bus. - Look, they egged each other on. I'm gonna check on my friend. - Sh... Excuse me. - Who's opening this door? - It's Karen. Open the door. I need to check on Monique. Open the door. - I'm right here. He won't let me out. - Where is she at? - Okay. 'Cause you're a ghetto ass hood ass bitch! - Get her hat. - You don't know how to ...in' act! - Move, James. Seriously? - I... No. - James. - Let's get you out the door. - This is not what we do. We don't do this. - We don't do this. - Who's walking Candiace out? - I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm-I'm fine. I'm very sorry. This is some ghetto ass sh... - Get in the car, baby. - Why am I being rushed away? - Get in the car. - I'm fine. - I need to make sure that you are away in a car, please, baby. It's about safety. - Please, please. - Just get in the car, please. - Get off of me. Get off of me. - I'm not... I'm not... - Get off of me. - Oh, sh...! Stop, stop! - This definitely ain't worth a fight. - Monique, come on! Monique! - Get off of me. - Calm down. Calm down. - Stop. - Get off of me. Then get off of me then! Get off of me then! - She gotta stop. - Where is my purse? - Y'all better not bring her around me. I'm gonna kill her. - Okay, let's go. Let's go. - Look, oh, she's killing her. - Oh okay. Why? - Hello. - Hi, babe. So, Monique just tried to fight me. She was trying to fight me. - What happened? - She was sittin' there talkin' about, "Oh, you're gonna drag me? You're gonna"... So, I was like, "You want me to? "You want me to?" You wanna ask for it? - She egged you on. I know, I know. - Okay, but then you get it. - Honey, open it. Open it. - I'm fine. I'm just embarrassed because this is crazy. Why are you coming at me so hard when I have been your friend, like, your real friend? I am hurt that she's comin' at me crazy out of left field. I don't get it. - Right. - I-I could blame Monique for this. - Well, true. - Yeah. - I blame her all the way for this. - None of us did. - Now, we're gettin' physical with each other. What the? - Well, if you keep talkin' crap, like, you're gonna get hit. - I'll talk sh... All... in' day, but I'm not putting my hands on people. There's enough sh... About black women fighting and scrappin'. I don't want to look like a... in' ghetto ass hood rat. Yeah. Love you. - Okay. - Okay. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Honestly, like, I can fight a little trick that thinks she's grown. It's not a big deal. Y'all better not bring her around me again. I'm telling you, right now. I'll whoop her ass. - I never brought... I don't want you talkin' like this, right now. Just get in the car. Get home. Call me when you get home. - Okay. - She was bleeding. - So, she says that Candiace started it, that Candiace picked up a glass and was, like, trying to throw it at her. - No. - Put your hand in my face first. - You gonna drag me? You gonna drag me? - Want me to? Do you want me to? - Okay. - Drag me. Drag me. - Do you want me to? - Drag me. Drag me. - Do you want me to? - Drag me. - Do you want me to? - It went in her face because of the tussle. - Hey, baby. I just got into a fight with Candiace. Yeah, last thing I remember is me flipping her hair, and then next thing I know, a glass flew, and then I grabbed her weave and was just bashing her head with my fist. I honestly, like, I blacked out after that. - Embarrassing for who? You think that people are just gonna sit here and let you get in their face and talk craziness, and what's gonna happen is, the hood gonna come out, and what she needs to understand, is that you don't disrespect people. - I feel like when you get to that point, it has to be extremely personal. - It breaks my heart. It really does. I mean... - It's unfortunate. It's kinda upsetting because they're good people, and this is bullsh... - Your mama is a working mama. Yes, I am. All right, Kam, we are talking about what America means. I'm stilling thinking about the fight between Candiace and Monique because that's not what I stand for. Obama's legacy matters, but America's legacy matters more. Every day, I go on the news. I speak up for people who are not given a seat at the table a chance to have a seat at the table, but now it's like, see? That's why we don't give people like that a seat at the table. I do all of this for you. And as a mom, all I wanna do is to be a good role model for my children, especially my daughter. Right, mama? Right? - Guys? - Yes! - Yes! - Are y'all packing? - Yes. - Yeah, we're trying. - I need pajamas in there, toothbrush, hair stuff. Don't forget deodorant. I don't want anybody stinky. Deodorant. - Mom, leave. - So annoying. - What happened with Monique and Candiace was deplorable, but, right now, I'm lookin' at my girls. I'm raising them to be strong black women. - Girl! - Goin' to Atlanta. Trying to pack up. I think I officially hate traveling with children 'cause you gotta make sure they're straight, you're straight. - Yeah. - Yes. Arizona's was an existing restaurant, and Jamal bought it for the girls, and it is relaunching. The Bryant family is about to take this thing over, and we're about to make it a success. Girl, listen, the barn. - It's kinda scarred me. - I was looking in her eyes hile she was grabbing Candiace's hair... - Uh-huh. - It was like the devil had possessed her. - Candiace is annoying as hell. She has a mouth on her. But to get physical with someone? I can't take Monique's side at all. She's so wrong for this. - She got bunch of 'splainin' to do. - Right. - I'm making you some tea. - Thanks, babe. Oh, my God. - You're gonna wanna give this some time. It's-it's very hot. How are you? - My forehead hurts. Like, it's sore to do this. - Do you need to see a doctor? - I'm fine. I feel fine. - You don't have a concussion? - I... she didn't... I don't think I was hit hard enough to be concussed. I feel fine. - That's good. If I start to feel crazy, I will go see the doctor. - Okay. - But, no, I woke up this morning in a panic. Like, what the happened? - Yeah, especially because you guys were friends, I'm sure the emotional toll on you is even worse than the physical one. Um, it just doesn't make sense. - It is. The more I think about this friendship, the more I just want nothing to do with her. - Mm-hmm. - Like, Monique intended to hurt me. - I-I don't understand it at all, but... - Like, I told you about Ashley's dinner. - Right, and you told me that she was upset because Charrisse came to the anniversary party. - Yeah. - I would expect for my girl, Candiace, to say, "Just so you know, so and so is gonna be here." - You guys both apologized to each other. How did it go from that to now this? - I mean, I don't know. I have apologized to this bitch more times than I care to count. I apologize for not letting you know. - Thank you. I appreciate that. - Yeah. - Y'all were in here for, like, a hour while we sat outside. - I apologize if you feel like we were sequestering ourselves. We had... - It didn't feel as though. Y'all did. - So, the fact that I have apologized to her multiple times, it makes zero sense. - At this point, it doesn't seem like there's much left for you two to discuss. - It's beyond discussion, at this point. - No, I understand. - Yeah, in here, rattlin' pots and pans for your birthday. Lord Jesus. Would help if I take the stickers off. Hold on. I have a chef coming over to help me cook you a special birthday dinner. - Okay. What are you serving? - Chilean sea bass. - You look good in the kitchen. You really do. - Oh, oh, I do... This turns you on? - Yeah. As a matter of fact, the-the outfit, it looks good. - Don't get used to it. - Okay. - I have a headache thinking about Candiace and Monique fighting, taunting one another. It was horrible, and it went too far, but I have my own issues, right now. It's your birthday. I want you to enjoy it. I'm trying some new stuff because I need you to know that I love you. My husband feels that I'm pouring more into becoming a businesswoman than paying attention to being his wife. - You have thrown yourself into the business, and so it got a little lopsided, okay? - Mm-hmm. - So, just recently, I felt a little bit neglected. - I think we're disconnected. We have to work this out. I don't think we need therapy. I know you... we're not into that but maybe somethin' different like a life coach where we could work on our relationship. - I'm trying to understand the difference between life coach, therapy. - They're similar. - Mm-hmm. - Why you lookin' at me like that? You don't think it needs workin' on? - No, I'm trying to understand what they are. That's what I'm saying, so I can know, you know, what to expect. - They're supposed to help facilitate us to grow. - Mm-hmm. - We're at a... We're at a standstill. Asking Ray to go to therapy is like pulling teeth, but this birthday dinner is not gonna fix the disconnect that we have. Um, so, I figure, if I package it another way, I'll still get him into therapy. One way or the other, we need help. I'm gonna make sure we get that help. It's your birthday. I'm not gonna go in too hard. So, switching gears here, I've been invited back home to participate in homecoming for my high school. - Oh, you mean school. Oh, okay. - Yeah. - Yeah, you're gonna go down to Surry. - I'm going to Surry. I'm thinking about inviting the girls, but, unfortunately, the girls I wanna take with me, I can't take with me. - Oh. - Because last night was a hot mess. - Really? - Monique and Candiace got in a physical altercation. - Ooh. What was the issue? - None of us know what took it there. I'm caught in the middle, and it's not a comfortable place to be in. I'm not choosing sides because I really feel that they're both wrong. I have no idea what's wrong with them, at this point. Candiace and Monique may not ever be friends. Conversations will have to take place, but if there's no hope, tell me that. - Who was the instigator this time? - I think both. - Mm-hmm. - Also, last night, Ashley revealed to us that the pictures on Instagram were indeed Michael. We wanted to know, did Michael tap it? And Michael told her no. - So, what was he doin'? - I guess just... I don't know, but Ashley said he didn't get a piece. - But did it come up whether he also likes men? - Michael made a comment about sausages and wanting to suck a sausage. - Because why would he confess trying to have sex with a woman and couldn't? - Okay, Ray, now you're bein' mean. All right, so, I'm gonna go ahead and cook you a meal. Happy birthday. Chef Kim, yes, to save the day. - Hi, Karen. You look... this is too cute. - Come on in. - Thank you. - I'm not a big cook, but I need to show my man that I am making an effort. Whether that be gettin' somebody to help me and teach me how to cook, who cares, because I need help! - So, we're gonna do a Asian twist on a Chilean seabass. - Yes. - So, basically, it's gonna be like your ginger, red miso, some noodles. - I'm just lookin' at all the ingredients, so I know. - Okay. - Girl, this is gonna make me look real good tonight. - Oh, you're gonna be a pro. Yeah. - I gotta help you somehow, so I can take some of the credit. - So, dump it in. See? That wasn't bad. - No, but... - Yeah, Karen, you did that. Stuff the mushrooms and both the noodles in there, the broth. - And the fish goes on top. - Yep. - Sweetheart, it's ready. - All right. Thank you, baby. Looks good. - Yeah. - Bon appetit. - Okay. Well, thank you. - Thank you, Kim. Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Enjoy. - Very good, baby. When you gonna do this again? - Coming up next... - I wanted to see how you felt about doing a postnuptial agreement, something that would be protecting Dean and me in the event that this happens again. - We're on our way to Atlanta! All right, who's in this room with me? Okay, this... so, we have this room, guys, and the room next door. This is a big weekend for the Bryants. We are relaunching Arizona's restaurant. Adore, me and you are over here. - Yay! - And the girls and I are gonna stay in a hotel because until the girls are all the way comfortable with where me and Jamal are, I think this is a great solution. We are in the rooms. - Can't wait to see you. Okay. And the hotel has room service, and Jamal normally don't have any food in his house, so there's that. Tomorrow, we're seein' pops. He's gonna meet us for brunch. You haven't seen pops in a while, so that'll be good. - Yeah. - Yeah. - My dad makes me internally happy. Hey! But I haven't told him that Jamal and I are a couple again because Jamal is not my dad's favorite guy, but I'm gonna tell him 'cause I surely don't want him to find out from the blogs. And then we'll meet your dad at Arizona's. Any questions before I retire? - No. - So, Milani, how do you think you want your hair today? - A bun right here and then some hair hanging down. - So, you don't want the braided mohawk. Hey, what's up, sweetie? - Oh my God, I'm tired. - I'm very much exhausted after all the shenanigans. What are your feelings? - Oh, you already know how I feel. - How do you feel? - I'm disappointed. - Well, I know that. - But I like Candiace and Chris, and I hate that you and Candiace are in this situation where y'all are actually physically hitting each other. Like, that's not cool. It's not a good image, and both of y'all... - Well, I don't really care about image. - I know you don't, but I do. - But my whole thing is... Yeah, I get that, but my whole thing is, forget image. - Ow. Ow. - This is reality, and she... literally talks crazy to everybody, and it's like her mama shoulda popped her a long time ago. Like, she's off the chain with it. Lay back, sweetie. When I got home from the winery, I explained to Chris everything that happened based on what I could recall. Obviously, he wasn't happy about it. Football players off the field have an image that they need to uphold, but, honestly, right now, that's not my concern. It just, like, escalated so fast. I don't think myself or anybody else saw that comin'. Like, I knew that we had whatever issues, but now... - Mommy, it's too cold. - It's too cold. But now, I-I really want nothin' to do with her. I probably don't need to ever be in the same room as her. And because she is bat crazy, this has literally been a long time comin'. This ain't no one time incident. It happened but... - Ow! - I'm sorry, baby. You know, I just literally snapped. So... - That's bad. - My parents taught me not to start a fight, but when you feel as though you're being threatened, you step on the foot, you grab the hair, and you punch in the face. I just went right back to childhood. My mom always said, "You better not start fights," but if I feel as though I'm being threatened, I can defend myself. So, if you're gettin' all up in my face, I'm taking you very seriously. And with the whole eggin' me on and provoking me, like, what she want me to do? Give her a hug and a kiss? Who goes out of their way to do that to someone that they called their friend? I don't know why you're here, but it's not to be friendly. - I'm glad both of y'all are okay. Y'all got glass flying around. Somebody coulda got cut. Coulda been serious. - Yeah. At this point, I'm done with her. She got issues for real. Crazy ass. - Well, y'all grown women can't even hang out without fighting. - Whatever. - Coming up next... - There's a guy that's not your favorite, their dad. - Mm-hmm. - Um... and we've been, um... he tried to get the family back together, so you need to know. - Are you here? - I'm downstairs waiting for you guys. - Okay. All right. Here I come. - Hello. - We are in. - Give me the hug. Oh. To breakfast we go. - Okay. Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited. - Oh, it looks good. - What do we take? - You take one of these, and then you take one of these. - And you want one of those. - Oh a thong, ok. - A thong is a different thing. - My dad is originally from New Orleans, but when he and my mom got a divorce, he moved to Atlanta. - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh, it looks good? - Yes. - So, Dad, this is a treat that we get to see you. - And I get to see you guys. - Yeah. Grace, would you like to tell pops what's goin' on wit' you high schooler? - It's a lot more work. - Hmm. - These two gettin' ready for high school. - Yeah. - Yeah. - They about to leave me. - Well, they'll be around a while. - They're gettin' older. I told them that y'all need to get a job, so y'all can buy stuff for yourselves. Oh, Daddy, by the way, so, Jamal bought them a restaurant. - Oh, okay. - It was a standing restaurant called Arizona's, and now it's about to relaunch. - Oh. - And these three ladies are the owners, so they have entrepreneurship. - Okay, all right. Entrepreneurship is important, owning something. - Yes. So, we're gonna go today and see everything and take a tour, and tomorrow is the ribbon cutting. - Oh. - Can you come? - Okay, I can do that. - This is good. So, I'm excited. You're gonna be with us tomorrow. - Right. - All right. Y'all ready to roll? - To the bathroom? - We're going to the bathroom. - Oh, okay. All right. Um... I did wanna tell you one last thing. Um, I know that there's a guy that's not your favorite, their dad. - Mm-hmm. - As you know, we've been able to maintain a great friendship, and we've had 12 years apart. I feel a lotta growth and maturity from him, and we've been trying to get the family back together. The past is the past, and to have ill feelings is totally valid, but, moving forward, you know, you gotta let some stuff go. Now, Jamal and I were engaged the first time. There was a little bit of tomfoolery. Grace, let her do it. I was married to Jamal Bryant. Unfortunately, Jamal was a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater. He loved to hide his salami. And my father didn't let that go, as no father would. When Jamal and I did get married, he didn't come. I feel great about where me and Jamal are and where me, Jamal, and the girls are. - Okay. - You told me, "You know, you gotta trust your gut." - You gotta trust your gut. - Right now, my gut's good. - Gizelle, I want you to be happy. - Thank you. - Now, I would never step in the way of anything that's gonna make you happy, ever. - You're gonna make me cry. - If you think that it's best for you and the girls, I'm in favor of it. I care about my granddaughters, so I want them to be happy. - Aww, thank you, Daddy. If I were to get married, again... - Mm-hmm. - I'm gonna need you to be there. - I will be there. - All right. - I'll walk you down the aisle. You can count on it. - Okay. Okay, I feel-I feel good. This is great. That's all I need. - Well, thank you for the breakfast. It was delicious. - Thank you. - All done, down to the last drop. Can mommy have a little burp? - Hi. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, baby. - Yeah, he's just finished a bottle. - Did he? You've been a good boy? - Yeah. - Good. - I'm so tired. - Mm-hmm. - Because now he's waking up at midnight, 2 a.m., 4 a.m., 6 a.m. - I know some of that, but I don't know as much as you do. - Right, he's a little sleepy, I think. I'm gonna try to put him down. - Then we get our time. Haven't really seen you much. - No, I know. All right. In a dramatic turn of events, no one is talking about Michael's infidelity. Now, all the heat is on Monique and Candiace. That's not to say that I feel all hunky dory about my marriage. If I am gonna stay in my marriage, it's trying to work it out. - Okay, if. - I'm 60% in, but I'm 40% out. If Michael does decide that he's not willing to change, Dean and I will hightail it out of that apartment so Goddamn fast, Michael will smell our dust. - You did it. - Yeah, he's down. - Good work. - I did pump recently so I can have a little. - Yeah, drink up. - Um, I know we haven't had very much time to do this with the baby and everything, but we've both done some things in our relationship that have contributed to us getting to this point. - Mm-hmm. - But, um... when did you start to feel that something was different in our relationship? - I just... I think we've both gone on the other side to a point where we've come a little too sedate, but that's because of the baby. I feel more comfortable in our relationship knowing it's a little bit more stable, but I-I also look forward to that intimacy that wasn't connected to our relationship. - Like the fun we've had. - Michael and I have been in situations where we've been with other people before. - So, when you say... - But when you say... Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Pick me. Pick me. - One at a time! - Can you pick me, right here? - One at a time! - So, you thought that the sex part was what was not connected in our relationship. - Yeah, I think of our relationship as a love, and a looking after each other, and looking after the baby, and all of that. In hindsight, I don't agree that I should've. - Okay, that is going to always be a temptation, and so are you going to be disciplined enough? - I-I definitely am gonna be disciplined 'cause I have to. I realize that. - Well, you had to, and you didn't. - I didn't, but I will. - An idea that I did have and that I wanted to see how you felt about was, um... doing a postnuptial agreement, something that would be protecting Dean and me in the event that this happens again. - Hmm. - An idea that I did have and that I wanted to see how you felt about was, um... doing a postnuptial agreement, something that would be protecting Dean and me in the event that this happens again. - Hmm. - Okay. - Sure. - All right. Michael and I had a prenuptial agreement that expired after five years of marriage. If it's a show of good faith to you that I'm in this marriage for the right reasons, I have absolutely no qualms about signing this agreement. - Appreciate that. - Now, in the event of a divorce, I will receive 50% of our assets, and now I think it would be good for us to have a postnuptial agreement, because postnup would outline things I would be guaranteed to get, no arguing, no disputing, and essentially would speed up the process in the event of a divorce. I don't really know what it would say, but... I'm so glad you're open to it. - I wanna make sure that you're happy, and I... And I look after you in the right way 'cause I think that's important right now. - I agree. - So, we're gonna meet the staff and then take a tour. - Yeah. - Hi. - Gizelle. - Hi. How are you? - How are you? Gizelle. - I'm Tymyra Brown. Welcome. - Yeah, she's the manager of the restaurant. - Nice. - Yes. - And so, we're gonna take you all through so that you'll see all of your responsibilities. - This is the bar area. - No bar. - No bar... no bar. - Only communion. Keep goin'. - The restaurant has been open, but we're tweaking some things. The girls and I are gonna do a walk through so that the girls can acclimate themselves for the relaunch. - This is our main wait. This is where all the food comes out the window. This is our drink station, as you all can see. - Do you guys make your own lemonade? - We make lemonade every morning. This is the dish pit. - This is where they'll be all summer long. - Ugh. - Oh, wow. Yeah, this is good training, washin' them dishes. - Where are we going? It's so cold in here. - I know, but it's our meat cooler. - It stinks. - You have your beef, lamb, your ribs, your pork. Everything has to be separated. - When you can give a kid something that's going to teach them something, that's way more valuable than some brand-new jeans. I love the fact that Jamal loves to take care of his kids. - This right here is the smokiest part of the kitchen. - I decided I'm not speaking on children that I-I did not give birth to because it's not fair to them or their mothers. The end. - Just like a barbecue pit, it gets up to 700 degrees. - Wow. - Whoever is back here has no eyelashes. - I said I was gonna set this up. You got me movin' furniture by myself. - Oh. - But I got it. - Okay, I didn't know. - I want you to sit beside me. This is where you're gonna sit. I thought she could talk to both of us. - Okay. - Now, let me tell you what tonight is all about. Can I pour you some water? - Yes. - Angela does what's called "Pillow Talk, and she finds fun ways to reconnect. We need help because this disconnect is not cool. Angela is here. Hold on, okay? - Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. - Be-be open. - All right. - I'm trying to get that love connection back with Ray, but I feel like I'm the only one that's putting forth the effort. - There she is. Look at you. - Look at this beautiful woman. Thank you. Oh, my God, good to see you. Angela is an old friend who host a radio talk show called "Pillow Talk." It teaches you how to enhance and reconnect with your man or your woman. - How you doin'? - You remember Angela. - Hi. Great to see you, again. - Yeah, we met before. - Perhaps she can help us to reconnect or maybe help us find out what the real issues are. - As you know, my goal is to get couples talking and listening to each other, really listening to how you feel love, because we all feel it differently. You know, and they call it the love languages. - Our think our love language is rusty, right now, obviously. - We'll start easy. - Okay. - Are you both still very intimate? - Not as much as we need to be. - Not... yeah, things are different. I mean, there was a time when the wind blew, and I'm ready, right? Now, I don't have to have a hurricane, but I-I need a little somethin' more than just a wind blowin', you know? - Okay. I'm trying not to laugh. He said, "I don't need a hurricane." - No. - What is one trait that annoys you the most about Ray? - He snores horribly. - I don't hear myself snore. - I-I get no sleep! - That's it. I have to ask you the same question. - Ugh. - Be honest. - Well, she appears to be always busy. To me, it felt like, before, we got time, but now we don't have time. - I started a company. - It's like a new baby. - It is a new baby, and so it-it has put a strain on Ray and I. He's thinking I'm not balancing the attention I give the business with the relationship. - Is that the way you feel? - Yes. After a while, then you sort of say, "Okay." What about me over here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, I... I'm curious about something. What are some of the things that you want now? What's missing? - A little more attention. Also, you used to cook more. - You did not say... - You see what I... I'm dealing with? - Oh, my goodness. - I mean... - I find it insulting. I have... - It is, a little. - Does Ray cook? - He used to. - Okay. - Oh. - When we were dating, he did. - But I'm just saying, okay, I'm just saying you-you were... I didn't realize it, but think about this. You know, she's technically cooking for the kids. The kids go. Then it's like, okay, there's no reason to cook anymore. I think you would feel more appreciated if you thought somebody was makin', you know, meals for you. And now, she did cook the other day, so I'm delighted for that. Tell me what she cooked. - Okay. So, she actually put the fish in the pan. - Oh, yes. - So, that nice brown sear you see, that's all Karen. - Yeah, okay. - Mm-hmm. - That's good. - Yeah, that's appreciated. - What about my needs? - What are your needs? What... name one thing. - Well, I feel like, honestly, sweetie, you really don't... You don't date me. You stopped planting that love bug, you know, that reason to keep the-the fuzzy feeling. Um, I'm a passionate woman that needs to know that you're in love with me. - Karen, kudos to you for saying that, because so many people, they become roommates. They love each other, but they're not in love. Are you in love with Ray? - I'm in love with Ray. - How do you know you're in love with Ray? - Because I can't imagine a day without Ray. - I don't think of days without you, either. I mean, I don't do that. - No, no, no, I... But she asked me a question. - I don't try to... I don't try to imagine. - I'm gonna ask you that same question. - Yeah. - Are you in love with Karen? - I think I am. - Are you in love with Ray? - I'm in love with Ray. - How do you know you're in love with Ray? - Because I can't imagine a day without Ray. - Are you in love with Karen? - I think I am. - After 23 years, you don't know. - Well, I knew at one point. I love you, and I think I'm in love with you, but it certainly doesn't feel the same way it did 20 years ago. Now, maybe it isn't supposed to. It's not bad because it's different. It's good. - But it's just different. - But it's different. - That's a huge discovery, right now. It's a painful one. I wanna be honest with you. Um, but everybody knows I'm in love with you, except for you. I feel like a mule has kicked me in my gut. - I appreciate your honesty. That is one of the hardest things, I find, with my listeners. They want their spouse to really tell the truth about what's going on, even if it'll hurt their feelings. - I knew we had distance between us, but I wasn't prepared for this at all. We got work to do. - We've barely scratched the surface, but we really got to some really good stuff, though. - Angela, thank you so much for coming. I really, really appreciate it. Ray and I both do. Thank you. - Take care. Alrighty. - I didn't expect to hear that you didn't know whether or not you were in love with me. That's pretty shocking. - I... No, I said that I believed that I was in love with you. - But you don't know. - Like I said, you're a little bit different than the person that I was in love with a while back. - What the hell? - And therefore... - Ray, no one stays the same. Everyone grows. - I know that. I was trying to answer the question honestly. - Well, I really appreciate your honesty, but I don't have to like it. I gotta breathe. I'm gonna take my mic off, okay? - Yeah, of course. - It's gonna be all right. - Good? I gotta breathe. - Guys, people are here. They ready. - Dad, this is happening too quick. - Don't get nervous. This is exciting, guys. Hey. - Good to see you. - Good to see you, sir. - Good to see you ladies. How you doin'? - You know, this is kinda like the first time my dad is around Jamal and I as we are now rekindling our flame. My dad is supportin' me. My kids are entrepreneurs. Life is good. - Today, this really is a larger metaphor than creating generational wealth is achievable. - Amen. - And you're gonna see our daughters washin' dishes. - There we go. - And they'll be bussing tables. - Uh, you-you-you don't hear none of them saying the amen. - I want to say thank you, Stonecrest, for the love and support. - Thank you, guys, for coming. - We're so excited. - Thank you, guys, for coming and supporting us. - Whoo! - Girls, okay, so, she's ready to pair you guys up with managers. So, you're gonna be with the general manager, waitress. - Okay. And you're hostess. - And then you're hostess. Okay. - Okay, you come with me. Okay? - Okay. My girls appreciate what their father is trying to give them and instill in them. This isn't just about generational wealth. It's the value of hard work. If they understand the value of hard work, they'll be able to teach that to their children. - Thank you. - Say, "Back up red onions." - Back up red onion. - Do I press it? Oh, okay. - How do you remember the table numbers? - Over time, like, you'll really start to get it. - Okay. - No problem. - Salt and pepper that just a little bit, that one. - Okay. - Do you do something different if it's, like, to go? - Yeah. - You need to notify. - Thank you. The girls make me proud. - Yes. - Yeah. - All right, so, maybe you could bring us dessert. - We can make that happen. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - This is night and day from yesterday. Daddy, we were here yesterday. - Yeah. - There couldn't have been what, ten people in here? - Maybe. - A-ha. - Wow. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Girls, so, y'all worn out? Exhausted? That's called work. - True. - Are y'all happy that your dad did this for you guys? - Yes. - Yeah. - I'm excited about your future and what we're gonna do as a family. They will not forget this day for a long time. - I hope not. - I won't. - Mmm. - This is the first time that my dad has been able to see what our new family unit looks like. Ladies, do you all need to get back to your j-o-bs? - Sure. - He's being supportive, and this really means the world to me. It really does. I talked to my dad yesterday. He said he wants us to be happy. - Thank you, Mr. Graves. It means a lot. - I want you to be happy, bottom line. - This is great. - All right. I'm gonna sneak out and go to the bathroom. - Okay. I thought you were gonna ask my dad my hand in marriage. - No, I-I think we've got some rivers to cross. - We just gotta take your mic off. - Yeah. - Next time, on "The Real Housewives of Potomac"... - I don't want this to keep lingering. I gotta call Karen to see if she can help me get everybody together. - Have a meeting at Karen's house. - If she's not like, "I can't believe I did this," then I don't think I wanna be around her. - All the girls are coming over. Mm-hmm. - Do you think that you did anything to contribute to what happened? - Um... - When the glass of wine went into my face, I remember reaching, and then it was all downhill from there. - That is a absolute lie. - You saying, "I'm gonna kill that bitch." You were aware. Looking at you in the face, Monique, you're not remorseful. - Not right now. - And that's... and that's what I'm saying. - That's the problem. That's the problem. - Yeah. - I'm gonna ask y'all in my house to lower your voices. - You showed me what you are capable of. I by no means want to be anywhere near you. - And maybe I don't need to be a part of this anymore. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
