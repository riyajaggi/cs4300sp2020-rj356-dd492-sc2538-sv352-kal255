 The Shadow Line (2011): Season 1, Episode 7 - Episode #1.7 - full transcript 
 Khokar is forced to retire after Gabriel rumbles that he had Petra try and kill Gatehouse. Gabriel is summoned by the retired Commander Penney who tells him that Counterpoint was a scheme set up to get dirty money from crooks via supposed laundering in order to finance police pensions. Wratten's discovery of this sealed his fate,thanks to the always trigger-happy ex-Secret Service man Gatehouse who was employed by Counterpoint. Beatty alerts Gabriel to Bede's deal with Babur and Ratallack but is not prepared for a change of plan. As villains fall out Gabriel goes to meet Gatehouse in a deserted rural location for a final showdown.

 (MONITOR BEEPING) It was designed to keep you breathing, but you never wake up again. Then, having fizzed your brain, it clears your system in minutes. So, if things have gone to plan, we would never have even known to look, because we would never have known it had happened. She was going to piggyback his heartbeat while it took effect, then rig him back up once it had. Clever plan. Except, sadly for her, turned out to be a game of two halves. -And her identity? -The thing is, Sir, we were hoping you might be able to help us with that.

 -Me? How? -There were no guards at the door. Now, again, if nobody had known anything had happened, no one would have any reason to ask why the guards weren't there. But that's not how it worked out, is it? And now we have. It was you, Sir. And what do you intend to do with that information? I think, more importantly, what is it that you intend to do? Because one of the cleverest killers since the Borgias knows that you just tried to kill him. So what do you think he is going to do next? It's time to call the cops, Sir! Only be careful who you call, 'cause around here, no one's who they seem.

 Be with you in a second, Gabriel. (PHONE RINGING) Who is she? In the hospital? -One of mine. -The one you had on Glickman? A little extra tab? And looking for him when he disappeared? And I presume she's the one who found him. Why'd you try to kill Gatehouse? -Things were getting messy. -Was it going to be me next? You should never have let him get so close. I wanted to see where it led. And here we are, sitting in your office. Time to put your pictures in a box, don't you think? Oh, and whatever you do, don't make a fuss before you leave. I could certainly make a noise about you. But then it would just be me giving the eulogy at your funeral. And I only want to be thinking nice thoughts. See, that's the trouble with you and your fast track. When you hit a dead end, it's too late to break. You're out, David. And you want to start enjoying the benefits of your efforts in your charming little cottage in the Dales? Stay in line. Or start running. You've got no one to blame but yourself. -What did you tell him? -Take an early bath. His pay scale, he can afford it. Are you going to throw another blanket on this? No. No, no, you can pick him up. Give him a couple of days to collect his thoughts. -I sense a promotion. -For you? Well, for both of us. You got your man, Gabriel. What if it doesn't end here? Oh, but it does. It ends here. I've supported you up to this point, because I knew he was a bad fucker but you go any further with this, you're going to start fucking with me. You've done brilliantly. Brilliantly, just like I knew you would. You should also know when to quit. So quit now. Hmm. I think you're going to look pretty good in my suit. What the fuck happened to you? Well, I need the next payment, yeah? -When? -Wednesday. You'll have it. -So are we back in business? -I was never out. You sitting this one out? Yeah, just like you told me. Do you remember? It's interesting, though, isn't it? Harris's death, Ratallack's deal, you taking over. It's almost like you planned the whole thing. Shh. Don't be so noisy. What's your plan for me, Jay? Ain't got one, Joe. Just as long as you stick to yours. Do you remember that, that rowing fellow? Who won all them Olympic medals? And he said that if he ever got back in a boat again, -then we should shoot him. -(SIGHS) Yeah. He did, though, didn't he? Just so you know, if he'd have said that to me, I would have. (SIGHS) (MOBILE RINGING) -Yeah? -We're on. She didn't fall, Joseph. Yeah, she did. The nurse said she fell down the stairs. She said she threw herself. No. It does happen. I've seen it before. But when I left her this morning, she wasn't confused, she was quite calm. Sometimes, at this stage of the illness, the mist is kinder than when it clears. But I'm not sure if this is the right place for her any more. You want to take her away? This time it's a fall, next time it could be worse. I think we should put her in care now, yes. -I'm so sorry. -But I'm nearly there. -Nearly where? -I've got a plan. -You can't beat this, Joseph. -We've got a plan. Change it. Change it now. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) You know that journalist, McGovern? -He got killed. Motorbike. -Yeah. Makes you think, though, doesn't it? What of? (PHONE RINGING) Gabriel. Oh. Yeah, I'll be there. I've got to go. Alone. -Why? -It's Laura. -Commander Penney. -Are you alone? Out here. (SIGHS) It was me gave Gatehouse the money. -Why? -Because he worked for us. -Us? -Counterpoint. I thought you worked for the police? A secret cell. Who set it up? -Paul Travis. -When he was Commissioner? Head of Special Branch. -1970... -Nine. -Oh. -No, it's not what you think. We used the change of government to cover it but they weren't involved. -Although we did turn to Section 5. -What for? -People. -Gatehouse? -He Secret Service? -Was. He's Counterpoint. He has been, for 30 years. He runs it? The field, yes. We run the money. -I thought you were retired? -(SIGHS) I am now. Khokar? And a man named Halton. From 5? Moonlit. And Paul Travis? Dead. Years ago. Cancer. So just Khokar and this Halton? No one else? What did it do? Counterpoint, initially money laundering. Who for? Set up to be a sting. Gatehouse started with small dealers, no idea who we were. But he'd gain their trust, turn their money. Word spread, it grew. Like a card game. As it got bigger, so did the players. Finally, we got to a deal of 70 million, and with that, we thought we could bring the house down. So, we went to the DPP, like a good cop should. -First strategy of arrest. -What did he do? He shut you down. He said it would never stick in court. Well, it's entrapment. And as we'd shown him our hand, he told us to fold it, with immediate effect. So, officially, we did as we were told. We shut it down. Unofficially? We made the deal. Seventy million. Into an account that didn't exist. And then what? We decided to play again. But this time, we decided to stack the deck in our favour. How? By buying the players in the first place. Harvey Wratten. Actually, it was his money man, Peter Glickman. Gatehouse found him. We gave him the cash flow, he linked up with Wratten, didn't tell him about us. And away they went. 200 million turnover. -Per annum? -Mostly. -40 million net. -Of which you took... ? Ten percent of all sales. -Into Counterpoint? -Correct. It became completely self-financing. -You still had to clean the money. -Oh, yes. -And we did that, too. -How? Trust me, one day you're going to thank me for this. Pensions, insurance schemes, yours, mine. Everyone's who worked for the Force. This whole thing's about pensions? For the benefit of all. Really? So does everyone get a boat like this or did you just tell yourself that when you bought it? Without us to plug the gap, the whole fund collapses. It's government-backed. How many schemes need to fail before it isn't? We look to the future, son. Which nobody else does. You're dressing this up as altruism. How sick is that? We provide for the future, your future. Harvey Wratten didn't get one and he was one of yours. Gatehouse gave him an opportunity to retire. -He didn't take it. -So you made him by putting him in jail? And then Glickman had this crisis of loyalty and told him about us. And Harvey threatened to tell everybody else unless we got him out. So, get him out we did. So then you gave the money to Gatehouse? To buy drugs to give to Customs to get Harvey a Royal Pardon. And when he got it, I think we might have left it at that, everybody. It was so compromised. But Gatehouse decided to close half his book. So that's what he did. And we've been cleaning up ever since. So, who had the money marked? (SIGHS) -I did. -Why? Gatehouse. He was starting to behave like he was his own boss. I thought he might be setting the whole thing up just to run away with it. It turns out money wasn't his primary concern. For him it's all about control. Isn't it ironic? One bit of police work I actually did, it's the bit that catches me out. Because if you hadn't marked the money... -Delaney wouldn't have spotted it. -And he wouldn't have told me. And we wouldn't be here. He's starting it again, you know. -Who? -Gatehouse. Whole new set of players. Who are they? You think you can stop this? He'll kill you. -He hasn't yet. -You can't stop this. That's what we were trying to do. Look what's happened to me. I can protect you. It was foolish of me to think you could even try. (GUN COCKING) (EXHALES) I didn't want a cup of tea, anyway. -No! No! -(GUN FIRES) (BIRDS SQUAWKING) (KETTLE WHISTLING) -That was pretty low, Gabriel. -I had to go alone. He wouldn't have taken any other excuses. -Don't you trust me? -Should I? Around here, no one's who they seem. -I'm a police officer. -Oh, yeah. That card thing. Doesn't really rub, though, does it? -Does with me. -Yeah? -Me, too. -Then we're together on this. I thought for you this was just a job. It is, with you, every step of the way. FORENSIC OFFICER: Sir Richard Halton. -HONEY: Who are they? -I'm handing over. What? Why? Section 5. He was, they are. GABRIEL: So what have you got? Well, it's been over 24 hours. He appears to have suffered a blow to rear left side of his head. What kind of blow? What kind? It may well be consistent with the fall. GABRIEL: Consistent, but not conclusive. Listen, after they finish, there won't even be blood. You know how they are with their own. -What the fuck? Where's Khokar? -He's disappeared. -Well, put a CAW out on him. -I already have. If we don't find him first, that fucking lunatic-looking vicar will. -Oh, and Honey's your gun girl, right? -Yes, sir. Then have her stick to you like tassels to a stripper's nipples. -Sir, we should go to the press. -Oh, what with? Suicide and a domestic accident? Find that fucking Gatehouse! Before he buries us all. What's going on here? He's got a potential shadow in the line. -Whose? -Harvey Wratten's successor. His name's Joseph Bede. He runs a flower import business, he's completely clean, but then he would be. That's how he'll bring it in. In the flowers. The trick is knowing which shipment. Get it wrong, you'll never get it right. So, who's the shadow? He's right at the centre, so he'll have to disappear for good. -How much is he looking for? -Quarter of a million. Yeah, and I'm looking to shag Barack Obama, but some things you're just never going to get. Do you know, I thought we could get together on this, cops, Customs, like the happy family we're supposed to be. If it's any consolation, I also hate my brother. -What's he bringing in? -400 kilos of heroin, single shipment. Street value 22 million. -He's starting it again. -Who? What if I could get you the money? -All of it? -What if I could? The we got ourselves a shadow. Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Come, please, sit down. -You want some food? -No. -You need to eat. -You sound like my dad. (BOTH LAUGHING) -Do I know your dad? -He was an arsehole. An arsehole who wanted to see his son eat. Only thing is I'm not much with family. -No? -No. 'Cause with me, it's either business or family. It can't be both. Then you and I, I think, will have little in common. Because you inherited your business from your father? Well, the thing is you didn't know, did you? You know, I've known you since I was like... Well, that big. And the truth is you've always been a bit of a hero of mine. Hmm. If I could window my house with flattery, I wouldn't need the glass. And I remember you had an elder brother. Didn't you? And that's who your father left the business to. But he was noisy, wasn't he? Everywhere he went, everyone knew he was coming. Until one day, he just didn't turn up. Ever again. And then there you were, shh, quietly taking control. (QUIETLY) Just like your family should have given it to you in the first place. Oh, it's hard though, isn't it? Waiting for that moment to come. I mean, that is strength. Real fucking strength. Maybe you should have taken a little strength for yourself before you went clacking back to your uncle with the cops in tow. But the thing is, though, Mr Babur. Mr Babur. Maybe I've taken it already. Maybe that's what I was doing all along, taking your lead. It's never nice to watch an old man refusing to leave a disco, is it? And I cannot tell you how many times Harvey had been asked to quit, right? But he just kept on wiggling. Silly old sod. Until in the end, someone had to bundle him off the dance floor. You. By leading the cops to him. -You understand now, don't you? -Hmm. Family or business. So, let's talk business. (SIGHS) You giving it in? -I'm taking it back. -Where to? Where it came from in the first place. Oh, Jonah. Laura, I still don't know who I am. Or what I am. What I've done to you is unforgiveable, I know that. I want to start to make it better. I want to make it all better for you. And the baby. Doing this is the way I can. I love you. I thank you. There's 230 there. He can whistle for the rest. -Where did you get it from? -From where this all began. But as far you're concerned, it doesn't even exist, you understand me? Ooh! Are you offline on this, then, Detective Inspector? No, I'm right back on it. 200, minus my 10 percent. What? And ifJulie Christie offered you one, would you still pull that face? -Okay. -Ah, ah, ah. There's someone else you've got to kiss first. So, what's the story? It's whatever you want it to be. (BIRD FLAPPING) (ECHOES OF POUNDING ON DOOR) MAN: Clear! (ECHOES OF DOOR SLAMMING OPEN) Clear! (ECHOES OF FOOTSTEPS RUNNING, DOOR SLAMMING OPEN) Clear! (GROANING) Oh, I could arrest you for that. You arrest someone? Now, that is a laugh. -You knew it was a setup. -No. How could I have known? They've been working me for months. -I would've put my life on it. -Yeah, well, maybe you just have. (GRUNTING) Where is he? You seriously expect me to know that? Move on, move on. (GRUNTING) Yes, move on. Move on. I'm going to bust your arse! You've been stung. I have. We all have. It hurts. Bloody happens. You must know something. People like you always do. Ooh! I think you bust a rib. (EXHALES) You got a wife? What? Kids? -You threatening them? -No, but you are. It's just a job, Beatty. It's just a job. Yeah, and this is me doing it. You just don't get it, do you, boy? Do you know how long I've been in this business? Almost 30 years. Now, do you know how I get to survive this long? It's by not knowing. It's knowing gets you killed. So, do you know what I think you should do now? You should go home. Just go home in that car you're always checking. But this time, don't even bother to lock it when you get there. Tell them how much you love 'em and that you're the luckiest man alive. And it'll be true and do you know why? Because you never even got close. Shit! Magic. It's all about getting them to look elsewhere. And never telling anyone how the trick was done? Never. Good. And finally, we are done. We are. What about your end buyer? Have you exchanged yet? I do that next. Five million. -You don't want to go again? -No. -Stick to the plan? -Yes. It was a clever one. Thank you. How is your wife? These are the ties to bind. My daughter makes them. Give one to your wife, keep one yourself, then when you are alone, you will never be apart. Remember, I warned you if there is a human in a plan there will always be a flaw? Yours is Jay Wratten and he knows how your trick worked. So watch out, I think he means to play one on you before you go. Why? Was it you orJohnny Cash who said "I'm giving up" right before he came back? -It certainly wasn't me. -Isn't that what they all say? Good luck, Joseph Bede. -What are you going to do with that? -Jay. -You're not... -No. But he's likely to try it on me. Always knew he would. You know you can't use that? -No, it's marked. -So what are you going to do with it? -You know, I was born near here. -Yeah? Yeah. Not like this. It's a shithole. I'm sorry I got too old. At least you got there. -What am I going to do when you go? -Stick to the flowers. No. It's a cut-throat business, that one. Hello? (INAUDIBLE) (DOOR BUZZING) Goddamn it! She's in our care now. -I'm sorry, Joseph. -It's not over. It's not. It's all right, darling, I'm here. Let go of me. Let go. Please. Let me go. (SOBBING) (POUNDING ON DOOR) Have you lost something? Well? With all the money you're about to collect, there is nothing you won't be able to buy. Nothing! Ready when you are, Joseph Bede. Just a minute. (HUMMING) (SOFTLY) I love you. You should go home. This is my home. (PHONE RINGING) Gabriel. Working late, Detective Inspector? It's you that keeps me up. I can tell you where Khokar is, if that'll help you sleep. If you can, it means he's already dead. There's more where he came from. Like who? -We should meet. -You really think? Yes, I really do. The lines have changed, Gabriel. Penney and Khokar, they tried to have me killed. So, now, my enemy's enemy... Isn't that ironic, me calling you? Where? People don't do bad things just because they want to stroke a white cat. All they thought they were doing was protecting their family. And if you'd have stayed within it, they'd have protected you. With a pension. No one else is going to pay it. -That's why they had to start it again. -To make sure it would continue. You shot Harvey Wratten. I shot Harvey Wratten. And who'd you get to take his place? The one that got Harvey busted in the first place. Jay Wratten. Hidden depths, that one. Plus a kid over on Bob Harris's side. Quite a whiz with numbers. A new Wratten and Glickman. And who's going to run 'em? Why didn't you kill me when I was in hospital? You seem so good at it. I would have. -But Khokar told me not to. -Why? He'd been urged to change his mind. By who? Patterson. Most people, they just see the surface. Him, he looks to the bottom of the pond. He certainly saw inside of you. You work for him? We've come to share the same sense of order. By putting him up there? And you beneath. And how are you going to do that? How you going to stop me? A gun. Trained on you. Now. And all I have to do is wave my hand, and she will shoot you. -Why are you doing this? -Because it matters. For other people to see you, standing out there in all that bright, white light? I'm sure it does matter. The problem is, Jonah Gabriel, that kind of glare, it just turns you blind. Because all I have to do is this, and your light goes out. No! You'll get over it. I'll live with that for the rest of my life. Well, at least now, when you hit 55, you'll be able to do it in style. Leave the gun at Khokar's feet, then come back here and get in the car. Why? He doesn't belong here. (REPORTERS CLAMOURING) Ah! Questions, questions. Which I'm sure Detective Inspector Honey can answer. We're not looking for anyone else in pursuit of this enquiry. So you believe Commander Khokar shot Detective Inspector Gabriel before hanging himself? Yes. -We do. -Because? Because, Detective Inspector? You're really trying to rub it in, aren't you, Michelle? Would be nice. Because as you've no doubt already read it in our statement, it appears DI Gabriel discovered that Commander Khokar had stolen a considerable sum of money from the department. -How much? -£250,000. All in bank coppers? (JOURNALISTS CHUCKLING) We found Gabriel's car outside a remote cottage owned by Khokar, and the three casings from the bullets used to kill him near a pathway leading up to it. So, whatever way you want to add it up, Michelle, it still cost one of my best officers his life. And where is this money now? We believe it was thrown from a rooftop in Central London. So where it is now, well, quite frankly, it could be in any one of our pockets. So, you know, please feel free to have a whip round. Do you have any comment on the murder ofJoseph Bede? The flower man? No. But it is true that Customs conducted a recent unsuccessful raid on one of his premises? Well, you'd have to ask them that question. I'm sure they can give you a much fuller answer than we can. Yes, but wasn't Bede murdered in the same way as Harvey Wratten? When you're shot, you're shot, Peter. -You don't think there is a connection? -Between what? Between Joseph Bede's murder and DI Gabriel's, given it was Harvey Wratten's murder Gabriel was investigating at the time? We've long since turned that particular page, Peter. And I believe it was your newspaper I was reading when we did so. So, for the record, you don't see there's a connection? Are you meaning all this in a Jungian sense? You know what I mean, Commander. Then, for the record, there is absolutely no connection between Jonah Gabriel and Joseph Bede. -So now it's our turn. -Yeah. For how long is that going to last? I think you know the answer to that already, and if you don't, you should. Twenty years, and then a headshot in the back of a car? Not if you remember the rule. Yeah? And what exactly is that? Simple. You, you're the threads. But me, I'm the rope. MIDWIFE: Okay, Laura, you're doing really well. It's almost here. -I need one more big push from you. -(GRUNTING) Give me a push now. (SCREAMING) (BABY CRYING) -It's out. -(CRYING) Here's your boy. Hey. Hey. Hello. (SOBBING) You know, it's funny, but in my business, you can't ever wash them enough. Now, then. Let's take a look at you, little fella. (LAUGHING) There you go. Well. I look forward to working with you, little man. -You can't have him now. -No? Well, let's wait a few years. at least until we can buy him a playsuit. -Jonah. -Hmm? You can't have him now. -Um, I don't follow you. -He's mine. In here, in my memory. And all I choose to remember is the best of him. And you can't take that from me. Ever. And you will never take my son. I didn't kill your husband. But it's what you represent that did. Oh, and is that how you're going to bring him up? Jonah on one side, us on the other? He'll know right from wrong, yes. Is it really that simple? Yes, it is. Do you know what, Mrs Gabriel? I don't think there's anyone, you, me, your husband, even this little fellow here when he grows up, who can absolutely say, without any shadow of a doubt, what side of the line they stand. No. I think the best that any of us can ever hope for is, well, just to walk it. I hope you like the room. -Jonah paid for it. -Yes, yes, he did. Of course, he did. That's... That's what insurance is for. And it doesn't stop here, as you know. So, whatever you choose to tell him, we'll still make sure his every need is catered for. Because if there's one thing you can be absolutely assured of, Mrs Gabriel, we always look after our own. www.tvsubtitles.net
