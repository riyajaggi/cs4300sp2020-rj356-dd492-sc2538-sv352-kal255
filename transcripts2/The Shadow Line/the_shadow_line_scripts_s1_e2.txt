 First, from the back point there. Two rounds, almost instantaneous. Both to the head. Second set from the front point. Five to the torso. Professional? The security of each point of fire. Killer's hand hardly moved. If he's not a professional, he'll be winning an awful lot of gonks in the fairground. Lot of shots for a professional. Single fire. Certainly wanted to make sure the job was done. So which one killed him? First. No doubt.

 Entered his left eye and exited by the lower right side occipital bone. The bit of the brain that supports breathing, well... that's all over the rear right seat. So he'd... He'd turned toward the gun? Yep. That's how the trajectories match up. -Why did you shut the door? -'Cause that's the way it was. No, when I got there the door was open. -That was for you to view the body. -Are you sure? Look at the second point. It's a sharper angle. That's why the killer stepped forward. -To avoid the door. -So where's the glass? What glass? If he'd shot him through the window, where's the glass? There wasn't any. He'd put his window down. They talked. -Maurice. -Julie. Okay? Trouble. Bulkat Babur wants his money. What money? When Harvey got caught, it was their shipment that got busted. -How much? -A million. Delivery payment. Well, tellJay to pay him. He led the police in. A million pounds? The thing is, Joseph, without Harvey and Glickman, we haven't got it, either. How was it? -Glickman's gone, hasn't he? -Yeah. -And he's not coming back. -Not in time. No. Set up a meeting with Babur. -Who else? -Just me. -What about Jay? -No. Just me. Joseph. I don't think it was a cold kill. Because? It was the first shot killed him. Second shot made sure. Bang, bang. Point blank. All over. Walk away. Except he didn't. This guy, he waited. Long enough for Wratten to slump into the footwell. -How long did that take? -Couple of seconds. So he waited a couple of seconds. So what? Seconds count, don't they? To a professional. Especially those. But this one, he waits. Just to put five more bullets... Five bullets, single fire into a body he surely would've known was already dead. All that noise. All that risk. Why'd he do that? Maybe he didn't like him. If he didn't like him, he knew him. So... Do you know who shot you? Sir? Well, do you? I can't remember, sir, as I think you know. I only ask 'cause when they found you with that bullet in your head, you'd lowered your window, too. You all right? -Yeah. -Is there anything you want to tell me? Yeah. Find that driver. I've told you everything I know. I've told the other fellow everything I know. -Who, Joseph Bede? -Yeah. What else can I say? Was he polite? I bet he was polite. He's very polite. But then, he is a florist. I think he might even be a little bit light in the loafers. But who knows, eh? -But that's not me Is it, sweetheart? If you think it's hurting him, then it is also hurting me. -That's not my cat. -I know. But next time it will be your son, if Andy Dixon even thinks about calling you and you don't let me know a moment afterwards. All right? First Glickman tells me to wait for Harvey. Then Harvey tells me to wait till he's got out. Now Harvey's dead, Glickman's disappeared. And you are telling me to wait some more. And who are you to tell me? The one who has the most to lose. We gave Jay Wratten 200 kilos and he went and lost it. He had a shadow on him, it wasn't his fault. It wasn't ours. Now, you owe us the delivery payment. One million. And I am done with waiting. I don't have a million to give you. Then maybe it's me who needs to find a way to pay you back. Then you'll never see your money. And nor will I. Harvey Wratten had me set up a brand new line, completely clean. He had me invest everything I own to make it look that way. Everything. But now Harvey's dead. And the only way you can make back your money is to allow me to make back mine. And the only way we can do that is if we set up that line together. So, come after me, you'll get nothing. Work with me and you'll make far more than a million. We both will. -I guarantee it. -I'll let you know. But I haven't told you how. You've had me waiting for two years. Now it's your turn. That's it. Five hours before Wratten got picked up. -You want me to send uniform? -No. I'll go. -Hello, hello. -Is your boss in? Doesn't ring any bells. You'll let me go through your employee list, won't you? Not without a warrant. Three names. Jason Ayolo, Andy Dixon and Daniel Cordel. Should you be doing this all on your own? Pretty girl like you? Think I can handle it, fat fuck like you. Got you. His name's Andy Dixon. We had him up on a minor drug charge last year. This is his home address. Got it. Sussex Gardens, E1 . -Hello? -The police are on their way to you. Tell them nothing. Nothing at all. Do you understand? Yeah. I'm looking for Andy Dixon. -He's not here. -Do you know where he is? Last time I saw him were yesterday morning. Has he called you? Are you the police? Why? Are you expecting them? You're expecting them. If Andy contacts you, tell him to call this number immediately. Say it's Gatehouse. Someone else has asked the same. Who? Jay Wratten? Someone else? Interesting. So after the police have called, you'll have three numbers to choose from. Difficult choice. Is it his? Yes. Do you love him? Yes. Then what I'm about to tell you is the most important thing you'll ever hear. Ever. If Andy calls anyone else but me, he'll be a dead man. If you call anyone else but me, he'll be a dead man. Cops, robbers, either way, you cannot trust them. So, you see, really, you have no choice at all. Gatehouse. I picked a good night. It's like this every night. The reception, mostly it's terrible. Is that coming in from Turkey? If only it were that easy, eh. If only everything were that easy. No, some kid in Croydon boosts the signal. I don't know how it works. All I know, mostly I have to park facing south. My family are watching this show right now back home in Turkey. And it's nice, because at least this way I feel we are watching it together. Does this mean anything to you, Mr Bede? Of course. -You have family? -My wife. -And children? -No. Just my wife. And you are happy together? You mean, do I love her? I... We've been married for 30 years now. I wish every day was the first. Hmm. You know, there are many people who want to work with me. And when they do, they always say the same thing. It's like they've seen a movie or something. They always say, "It's just business." I think they want me to think they're professional, cold. But for me, for what I do, it's never just business. Because everything I do, I do for my family. And anyone who threatens me threatens them. Do you understand? You understand? So... What's your plan? To turn the million pounds I owe you into 10 in three months. And how will you do this? To begin with, I'll need a single shipment from you of 200 kilos. On account. You know how much that is worth to me? Three million at 15 grand a kilo. But I'm willing to pay you back at 20. Which would create an extra million pounds on that shipment. As it would a fourfold increase in your debt. -Correct. -Four million pounds. The loss of one million, we are talking. The loss of four, -the talking would be over. -That's not going to happen. It's taken me five years to set up this line. I'm completely legit. I'm taxed, regulated and inspected like clockwork. As long as I keep the rhythm, nobody will notice the addition of a few extra beats. -Two hundred kilos. -600 in all. And how will you make this work, do you think? As well as the first, you have to guarantee me two more shipments of 200 kilos each, once a month. I'll buy those two off you at 15 grand a kilo. They have to be at least 70% pure because I'll be bashing each of them up to 250 kilos, then cutting them into a thousand corners and moving each one on at five grand a corner. At the end of the three shipments, we'll have turned over 15 million. Ten to you, five to me. -In three months? -In three months. -And who will you move it on to? -Bob Harris. Does he trust you? Do you? I'm in for this one run and then I'm out. But if it's the success you say... Then I'll have proved it works, then he can buy it off me at cost. Or you can. -How much? -1.5 million. Either way, after this I'm out. With six and a half million? -It's not so much. -It's enough. What do you need it for? Well, like you say, it's never really about business, is it? Hmm. I'm just going to give this to Mr Babur. Arum lily. Just in from Holland. And this is the plan? Within the stems. To help disguise the smell of the shit. What else are flowers for? Beauty. I think you see beauty in maths, Mr Bede. I used to be in insurance. Figures are beautiful things, figures always work out. But put human beings in your plan and you cannot be so certain. With humans there will always be a flaw. -Not this one. -Always. It may work out. But there will be a flaw. -What are you trying to do? -You're hurting me. I am now, yeah. I am. There's police outside. They're watching the house. Oh. I better make this quick, then. -What did you tell them? -Nothing. I didn't tell them anything. I don't know where Andy is. Oh. Look. -Put your hands up. -What? Put your hands up. Up! Put your hands up. Put 'em up. Ah. Is it his, then? Is it? A little Andy Dixon, inside there? Isn't that funny? Don't do that. I wonder if history will repeat itself? You know, in many years to come, I wonder if your little baby there, maybe he'll be the one to see me get shot to bits in the back of his cab, and then he'll run away, and my family won't be able to find out what happened. Just like his old man did to my uncle. And then I'll be down there, burning myself to a frazzle. And I'll be thinking, "Blimey! And to think I had the chance "to kill the little blighter before he was even born." Oh, God! No. No. No. Stop it. No! Don't upset yourself. Because this story has a happy ending. Because luckily, his mother was a very clever woman. And she decided to tell me everything she knew. Aww... Bye! -Plainclothes. -Yeah, I know. She told me. Yeah. And what else? No, she doesn't know anything. But when she does, she'll call me first. Right. Should we go and have a cup of tea with his mum? Mrs Dixon, look at me. No, look at me. Mrs Dixon, what I'm about to tell you is the truth. And your son's life depends on whether or not you believe it. Do you understand? Yeah. The police will say your son killed Harvey Wratten. No. As soon as he gives himself up, or as soon as they catch him, they will charge him with Wratten's murder. -But he was just the driver. -That's right. He didn't kill no one. And you know that because you're his mother. I know that because it's true. And I know it because I've spent my whole life working with people like your son. It's what I do. Catch 'em early. You get to spot the killer, Mrs Dixon. And you're right, your son's no killer. So why would they say he is? Because they've got to put someone's head on a plate and your son's is the only one they'll get to fit. But what about the real killer? Harvey Wratten ran a criminal underworld so deep the police couldn't even hope to see the sides. So, they're going to use your son instead to drop him in it. -Quick and neat. -Quick and neat. That's right. This has happened to you before, hasn't it, Mrs Dixon? To your eldest son. To Tracy. He's in jail, isn't he? And the same thing happened to him, didn't it? They turned him into a scapegoat, too. Both sides made sure he took the rap for something he didn't do. They told lies at his trial. All of 'em. Except with Andy, Mrs Dixon, he won't even go to trial. Because there won't be one. -There'll have to be one. -No, there won't. This is how it will be. Your son will be placed on remand, awaiting trial. And then one morning, a prison guard will enter his cell and find him hanging by his sheet, tied to the window grill. And the police will come and visit you and tell you how sorry they are but that sadly, it isn't that uncommon. And how they couldn't be to blame because up until that point your son had shown no signs of wanting to kill himself. And then they'll leave. And that'll be the end of it. Because you'll never discover the one mistake they made. The one the prison guard failed to spot. That the chair your son would have needed to reach up to that grill had already been neatly placed back against the opposite wall, long before the officer entered the cell. That is how it will be. Tell Andy to call me. Me and only me. A lot of people are going to be knocking on your door now, Mrs Dixon. Who? Police. Harvey Wratten's men. Both sides. But all of them wanting the same thing. And none of it matters. All that matters now is whether or not you believe me. Mrs Dixon? -Yeah? -Police. We're here about your son. -She doesn't know anything. -You're sure? Mothers are always the last to know. -How about his mobile number? -I asked. She said she didn't have one. That he changed it so often, she couldn't keep up. So when did she last speak to her son, exactly? -She couldn't remember. -She couldn't remember? Well, definitely not since he disappeared. And you believe her? -There's no reason not to. -You're a police officer. You want to become a good one, you better learn to put that answer the other way round. -To not reason no? -Huh? -Just putting it the other way round. -Oh, you're sharp. Well, I'm a police officer and I think I'm a good one. And I haven't got a clue what you were trying to say. You walk into a bar, Honey, you sit straight down or you scan it first? -I scan it. -She'd sit straight down. What's that? Andy Dixon's mobile phone number. You already had it. That's not fair. From the provider to which it's registered and has been registered for the past three years. Oh. And the last time he used it was approximately half an hour after Harvey's Wratten's death. -And who do you think he called? -His mother. Bring her back in, will you? And this time, I'll ask the questions. If I knew where he was, I'd tell you, but I don't. Well, now you know who to call  when he does. -Yeah, I do. -Good. Hmm. Mmm. Mmm-hmm. You've got another son, haven't you, Mrs Dixon? -Yeah. -In jail, what's his name? Tracy. Oh, dear, I bet he gets a bit of gyp for that on the inside. I know I'd give it him. -Do I know him? -Your uncle did. Oh. -How long has he been in? -Three years. Serious. I don't know. He didn't do it. Do you know what? In jail, there isn't a man who did. -Have you got anyone else in your life? -No. No Mr Dixon? Oh, that's sad. No other family? Just the boys. That's nice. You must be very close. Especially now Tracy's getting himself touched up by the nonces. If only you'd called him Peter! But still, I imagine Little Andy looks after you now, doesn't he? Especially now he's the big man. -He's a good boy. -Yeah, I bet he is. So, did he buy you this carpet, then, did he? Or that TV? Or that phone? It looks like you've won the lottery, Mrs Dixon. Or someone else has. Has little Andy won the lottery, Mrs Dixon? You kept that quiet. Yeah. Well, for a moment there, I thought all I could smell was the carpet glue. But I was wrong. So I can smell something else, can't I? Something much stronger. This bullshit. So, if I were you, bitch, I would start to clear the air. Hello? Okay. Thank you. The policemen are on their way up to come and speak to you. Yeah. You going to tell them nothing? I've got nothing to tell. Yeah, good. Well, when you do, be sure to call me first. You got my number? Yeah. -I've got your number. -Yes, well, I've certainly got yours. -Who you looking for? -What? I'll bet I find him first. What are you afraid of, Mrs Dixon? -You. -Of me? -You people. -Why? You're going to try and fit him up. Make it look easy. Make it look neat. -Why would I do that? -'Cause you ain't got nothing otherwise. You're staring into an abyss, I know it. How do you know that? And all your puny little flashlight's gonna pick up is my boy. Just like you did his brother. -Tracy Dixon? -It wasn't like you people said it was. Six years, Mrs Dixon, it must've been like something. He was set up. You set him up. It wasn't my case. And it is certainly immaterial to this one. I'm sure you'll still find a way of putting it in. For colour. Mrs Dixon, it is very probable that Andy is the sole witness to a murder. And all I want to know from him is exactly what he saw. So, why aren't you talking to him? Because we can't find him. So why are you wasting time talking to his mother? Because he called you, Mrs Dixon, approximately 35 minutes after the event. -That's not true. -It's here. I can even give you the timings. Two minutes, 12 seconds. What did he say to you, Mrs Dixon? What did he say the night Harvey Wratten was murdered? You don't have to answer that. She doesn't have to answer that and you know it. Then be sure to explain to her how assisting an offender is a criminal offence. Don't be stupid, Honey, anyone could have picked up that phone. What did he say, Mrs Dixon? What did he see? Why did you say "abyss"? What abyss am I staring into? Because if I am, doesn't that mean your boy is already there? Do you want me to save him? Do you want me to go down there and get him out? Because I will, but you've got to throw me a line. You've got to throw me a line. You don't have children, do you? -What? -You don't have children. No. I know. Because if you did, you would already know that I would do anything, anything to save my child. -Including lie to me? -You don't have to answer that. Anything. Hey. What time is it? It's late. Early. I don't know. Well, then it's definitely time for bed. I'm so sorry, Laura. -For what? -Everything. The babies. I know you want to try again. The clinic said we could, that we should. They've said that before, haven't they? Five times. We've tried five times, Laura, and every time, the same cycle. Hope, loss. Hope, loss. In the end, I'd stopped hoping at all. I hadn't. And when you got shot, when they said you wouldn't pull through, I didn't then, either. -And here you are. -With a bullet in my head. -Which didn't kill you. -Which still might. Hasn't yet. But is that what you're afraid of, that it will? Is that why you want to do this? We're all going to die, Jonah. A bullet or an unseen bus. Your name's no further up the list than mine. But yes, I would like the chance to make a life before we go. It'll be our sixth time, Laura. Or the first. After a second chance. Hey, come on. Go on, clear off. Trying to open up here. Come on. We got a fix on Andy Dixon's mobile when it went up at 4:51 this morning. And then it went off? Yeah. By the time anyone got there, he was gone. Are you sure it was him? Café owner kicked him out of his doorway. So, he's sleeping rough. Exactly, he needs help. And bets are he'll be calling for it. But when he does, whoever he calls will be calling me. Because you scared the shit out of them? Yeah, well, maybe you'd like to send them a nice little bouquet when all this has worked out. It's not Stanley knives keeps people loyal, Jay. It's them putting that in there, and us giving them the means to do it. Yeah, well, let's just see who they call, shall we? All this just to find Andy Dixon? He was there. And what if he's got nothing to say? Oh, he will. And when he does, I want him telling it to me and not them. It's me. He's up! We're picking him up from the mast on the corner of Jacob Street and Parkside. -Postcode? -E9 5JB. Get an India 99 in the air now! -Can you listen in? -Yeah. He's talking to a female. Why didn't you call? I couldn't. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. Everyone's looking for you. -Who? -Everyone. Have you spoken to the police? -Don't. -Why not? He threatened to kill the baby. -Who? -Jay Wratten. Shit. You have to speak to him, Andy. He says he's going to kill the baby if you don't. It's my baby. What's happening, Andy? What are you in? Babe, I don't know. I don't know. Well, what did you see? Wratten gave you his number? Yes. Okay. Give it to me. Come on. Come on. Come on. That's it, come on. Hello? Who wants to know? Where are you? Well, I'll find it. Have you spoken to anyone else? Don't. You really, really don't want to do that. He's ringing another number. -Are you all right? -Listen to me, sweetheart. He has the eyes of a gun shooter. Stay away from him! And stay away from the police, too. I don't know what to do, Mum. -What should I do? -Just stand still. Stay where you are. Keep the phone on. I'll call you straight back. Trust me, darling. Everything will be fine. Fucking hell! What's going on? You idiot! Don't you know what you're doing? You drove through red lights! Oi, do you hear me? Get over yourself and your fucking Toyota Corolla. You went through red lights, not me! Where are you going? Oi! Come back here. Oi! Fucking hell! No one's talking to me! It's the same mast. -So? -So, he's not moved. -Honey, you know the area? -Yep. All right, loop over the top of the park, then drop down in case he runs that way. We'll stay north. Where's the uniform? Oh, you bastard, answer. Why am I standing still? Traffic incident ahead. Where's that chopper? -No response yet. -What? -Look, this is a murder inquiry! -No, sir. Shit! Shit! I am on foot. I am on foot. Typical fucking British car chase! All right, I'm here. -Hello? -Run. He's moved. He's heading south. Honey, where are you? -A minute away, Eastside approach. -Got it. -Hello? -Where are you now? Uh, I'm on the park exit at Old Ford Road. -You're still being followed. -No, not any more. Yes, the police are tracking your phone signal. -Stay with me. Follow my instructions. -What? Shit! Shit! We missed him. Then left into Mace Street. We're left into Mace Street. Be advised, Mace Street's a cul-de-sac. Shit! And right onto Roman Road. Picking him up now on Roman Road, southwest. Lost him. Damn! Take the westbound train, get off at Liverpool Street. Stay on the platform. Shit. -Signal down. The Tube! The Tube! Central Line, westbound! Westbound train towards Liverpool Street. Yeah, I'm en route. Five minutes. Shit! Shit! Ladies and Gentlemen, there is a good service operating on all London Underground lines. Give me your phone. Follow me. Keep your distance. -Sorry. -Careful! He's back up. Liverpool Street Station. Liverpool Street entrance and walking east. I can't see him.
