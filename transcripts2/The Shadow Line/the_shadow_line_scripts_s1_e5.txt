 Wow. And that's German? Augsburg. They're very up with that sort of thing. My wife's German. Is that right, sir? Double heart bypass last year. Strong as an ox now. (SIGHS) I'll take it. I mean, what can you buy if it's not a bit of time? -Montana? -Big sky country. I'd expect shipping of about a month.

 That's fine. -Morning, Paul. -Ralph. -Who was that? -Mr Donnelly. -And he is? -The owner. Peter? Peter, it is you. Wow. I mean, it is, isn't it? Are you speaking to me, sir? I am. It's me, Austin Lessing. We did a deal together, remember? Hampton Towers. What is that, 20 years ago? Well, you can't forget something like that. Well, I can't. I never had to work again. Not me, sir.

 And I've owned this shop for over 20 years. Ask anyone. -Oh. -Yes, sir. I mean, you're different, sure, but then, look at me. Wow. It's Donnelly, sir. Paul Donnelly. Wow, Mr Donnelly, sir. You have a doppelganger. And his name is Peter Glickman. My mistake. -Did you find it all right, sir? -What? Oh, yeah. Uh, your boss... How long has he owned this shop? Oh, I couldn't say. -But he brought me in in '88. -Oh. So, come back to your roots, sir? -Mmm? -Dublin. Oh, yeah. Well, that's the thing about roots, isn't it, sir? Doesn't matter where you go, they'll always find you out. I just sold that Augsburg. I can't get the cap on that fusee. Will you take a look at it? Sure. Well, you couldn't. The ratchet's broken. -Paul? -He dropped his money. -How much? -It's 100 Euros. 100 Euros. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. I believe you may have an Austin Lessing staying here. Yes, sir, we do. Ah, well, he just visited my shop and he dropped this. Oh, dear. That's not the point of them, is it? And it looks quite full. Ah. Um, well. That's very good of you to bring it in. It's the way I was raised. Is he in his room, do you know? I don't believe he is, we have his key but I'll make sure he gets it when he checks in. Don't worry, sir. I was raised the same. -Not many left. -With every passing day. I'm so sorry, did you take my pen? -I don't believe so, sir. -(LAUGHS) -I'm sure I had it just now. -Um... No, sir. (LAUGHS) See? If it had been mine, I'd have lost it, too. Room 219, please. -This has been left for you, sir. -Oh, that's not mine. Yes, sir. Apparently you dropped it in a shop? -What shop? -Didn't say. Oh. Uh, thank you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Can I come in? -What? I can't be seen here. What are you doing? Hey! Hello, Austin. I knew it was you! I absolutely knew it. Peter Glickman. (LAUGHS) Jesus. -Your accent? -Yeah. It's just a knack. Was that you with the money? It's not mine. Would that be because of the call girl cards? Absolutely not. My mistake. What's going on? I mean, what the hell are you doing in a clock shop? I like clocks. Last time we met, you were running an empire. Had to let it go. -Why? -It would've been the death of me. But why the change of name? That's what's keeping me alive. But the guy in your shop said he'd known you for years. -He has. -I don't understand. As Paul Donnelly. Here, I've been Paul Donnelly for over 20 years. How? He didn't used to see me that often, no one did. Once a month, that sort of thing. But I set up a life here, business, home, tax, the lot. Just did it all in the name of Paul Donnelly. It's really not that hard. But why do it? You have to prepare for these things. Just in case. It's like a new room. Change it slowly enough and no one will notice it's happened. Then, if you need it, it's yours, just to step into. And nothing looks strange because in a way, you've always been there. A double life? Not any more. This is who I am now, full-time. Wow. I can't even plan a weekly shop. You're here with someone? Oh, no. My wife's back home. Double bypass last year. -No girlfriend? -What? -Here? -Look at me. Well, what about you? Is that what this is all about, huh? A new life with a new girl? Actually, Austin, I'd have given anything to bring the old one with me. Why didn't you? Someone wants to kill me. -Oh? -And if she knew where I was, this man, he'd kill her to find out. -Oh, my God. -(LAUGHS) Yeah. Ironic, isn't it? The kindest thing I could do to the woman I love is to never see her again. -Ah. -Hmm. It's not knowing where I am keeps her alive. That was a good deal, Austin. The one we made back then. It was, Jesus. You made me a wealthy man. We got lucky. I certainly got lucky meeting you. -Not this time. -How do you mean? What time is it with your wife? 6:33 a.m. Is she a light sleeper? -No. -So you haven't called her yet? -No. -Good, called anyone else? No. Well, I mean, since when? -Since you saw me. -No. May I see your mobile phone? I swear, I... I haven't used it. (SIGHS) I wish you hadn't have come into the shop. What? You shouldn't have come into the shop. -I didn't know not to. -You shouldn't have seen me. -I can't be seen. -Then I didn't see you. I won't say a word, I promise. Do you know how hard it is to keep a secret? -I can keep this one. -That's what I thought. But look at what's just happened to me. Don't run. If you run, I'll disappear and next time you see me, I'll be in your bedroom at 425 Rayfields Road, Columbia Falls, Montana. In my shop, you wrote it down. And if that happens, your wife will never wake up again. So don't run. -I wasn't going to. -Good. -So, we haven't got a lot of time. -Why not? -Some people are coming to see you. -Who? Doesn't matter. But they're on their way, and while we wait, I want you to do something. Something for yourself. What? Call her. Call your wife. Why? -Tell her you love her. -Why? She'll need to know that. And I'm giving you the chance to say it. -You're wanting me to say goodbye? -Don't pass it up. It's a chance I never got. It's okay. (DIALLING TONE) Call her. (GRUNTING) (DIALLING TONE DRONES) (LESSING GRUNTING) (AMERICAN ACCENT) Hi, it's Austin. So, where are you? Good. Come straight on in. No! Main entrance, through the revolving doors. Why not? Free country. Yeah. Grand apiece, up front, for you and your guy. Has to be both, though. Right? 'Cause that's the way I want it. Wow. Room 219, door's off the latch, I'm waiting for you. And he never brought you back a gift from somewhere you wouldn't have expected him to be? You mean from where he is now? Maybe. He wouldn't be that casual. His son doesn't even know I exist. Just this in your bank account? Yes, every month... (CLEARS THROAT) Uh, last one last month. All from abroad. Never the same place twice. No. And no communication at all? He won't be found. You know that, don't you? Not unless he wants someone to find him. (SNIFFS) I...do know how you feel. My wife. She's ill. Alzheimer's. -Oh. -And I loved her... love her very much. But all I have now is our past. And it's a lonely place to live. (DOOR CLOSES) -Morning, Paul. -Ralph. (BEEPING) (COMPUTER BEEPING) (BEEPING) Are you all right? I'll wind the clocks. Are you sure? I'll be right along after. -Oh, and Ralph. -Yeah? Thanks for everything. Live long... BOTH: And die in Ireland. (LAUGHING) Good night, Paul. (CUCKOO CLOCK WHISTLING) (WHISTLING STOPS) Hello, James. Peter. You're not surprised. Saw you in the shadows. So you still know where to look? Where else would you be? How? -If you want to disappear... -You have to do it completely. No ties, no trails, nothing. It's hard. -You can't imagine. -No, I can't. But then, that's why you're you and I'm your Controller. So, why the pause? -Hmm? -You could've killed me at the door. You must have something you want to tell me. Where did you get the name? Paul Donnelly? Launch manager, Apollo 11. Everyone remembers the astronauts, no one remembers the guy who pulled the strings. Harvey Wratten. Royal Pardon. That was quite an achievement. Why didn't you have him killed in jail? This is our thing, not theirs. -So, you got him out? -I got him out. Just to have him killed? Oh, no. I did it myself. But you could've just let him live. I mean, once he was out, he could never say how you did it, because if he had, he'd have been straight back in. It wasn't the pardon that worried me, it was what he threatened to expose if I didn't get it for him. Our thing... Our thing. Counterpoint. Because if that got out, then there'd be real trouble. Like you've never seen. You shouldn't have told him, Peter. You shouldn't have let him go down. I'd offered him retirement, he wouldn't take it. -He wasn't ready. -He should always have been ready, that was the deal. He should've stepped aside. It was time to start again. -Who with? -I'm working on it. Young blood, eh? Well, I don't want to be having to do this every 10 years, now do I? And me? Got someone to replace me? Working on that, too. Harvey was my partner for nearly 30 years. And I was your superior long before that. And after all those years, you were willing to let him die in jail? -I gave him a chance not to. -So I gave him another. And look what you got for your trouble. Four hours of fresh air for your partner and a shadow of a life for yourself. Things didn't go to plan. They would've done, if you hadn't forgotten the rules. Your rules. "Controller." It's not just a name to you, is it? It's what you have to have, no matter what. But there must've been a while back there, after I disappeared, when even you thought you'd lost it. Knew I'd get it back. And that's why you didn't kill me at the door, isn't it? Because getting it back is what you wanted me to see. How are you going to do it, James? I'm guessing not with a gun, far too noisy. But your own hands? You must be angry. And to think, if I hadn't left that phone signal, you wouldn't be here. But you did. And I am. -You followed the trail. -The one you left. But what if I knew you couldn't help but follow it? May I? The only person who could force my son into leaving a message on that phone was you. I knew that. And I knew that once I picked it up, you'd follow the signal. And because you thought you'd found it, it would never occur to you that actually, you were being led. Because it's who you are, what you do. Control, at any cost. Any cost. Ironic, then, isn't it? That by coming all this way to get it back, you lost it altogether. Human, after all. (DOGS BARKING, CAR ALARMS SOUNDING) Not strong enough. Kill you, save me, it was a tricky balance. That tipped my way. I'd say right now we're about even. (FIRE TRUCK SIREN WAILING) Hello. It's late. Or early. These days, I never know which. -Should I be sorry? -No. -But I am. -Don't be. -I think it's just 'cause... -It's difficult. For us both. I'm not. Nor am I. (SIGHS) Hmm. Um... But you were right. About what? The past is a lonely place. Unless you hear someone else say it. (MOBILE RINGING) Gabriel. We're ready for you. Look, I've got to go. What? Patch him through. So sorry, go on, I'll follow. -Jonah... -Laura, go on. I'll be there. Is that DI Gabriel? It is. I know who shot you. I'm sorry? Follow the drugs. What drugs? Follow the drugs. Who is this? My name's Peter Glickman. Follow the drugs, Detective Inspector, and then we'll meet. (SPLASHES) What can you see? Sorry. Ah. There. (HEARTBEAT WHOOSHING STEADILY) God. TECHNICIAN: All is well. I'm not sure I should be doing this. Then you know what? Don't bother. But when you go home tonight be sure to ask yourself exactly what the hell you're doing this job for. About two grand more than I'd get in private security. Then make it count. They've gone. -Gone? -They've been destroyed. No, this drugs haul secured a Royal Pardon. -When? -Last month. You sure? Evidence number: ref/2417 Wratten. Heroin, six consignments, incinerated. Why? They must have thought the case was closed. On whose orders? Why did you have the evidence burned? You know, you keep doing this, I'm going to have to take out a restraining order and that won't look good on your record. 849 kilos, on your instruction. I think you're referring to a restricted file. So you know what I'm referring to. Harvey Wratten's dead, DI Gabriel, get over it. We have. -So you closed the case? -Ta-da! Shouldn't you have kept back 10%? Now you're telling me how to do my job, you don't even look like you know how to do yours. -Then teach me! -10% is for pending cases. Self-evidently, this one isn't pending. If we kept everything, pretty soon we'd have no more space. It's actually just a basic law of physics. Unless you think Wratten's a fucking vampire. Seemed to have plenty of space when I was there. Maybe that's because unlike you, we know how to close a case. -No, you don't. -Why? Where are you going? Where you can't follow. Shit! What are you looking for anyway? What are the drugs going to tell you? Something someone said. -Who? -(PHONE RINGS) Gabriel. A two kilogram sample was taken from the second consignment. -There's the date. -Where were they sent? To you. Me? Well, to your side. Why? Apparently there was a problem with the code. You see that? That's ours. And we write it on the evidence in ultraviolet. Yeah, so do we. Yeah, well, on this one and 12 others like it, when they came into us they already had a code written on them. Ours. Yes. Yep, we received it June 13th last year. Is it still in storage? Should be. We'd like to see it. We'll call you when we've finished. Um, you know you'll have to sign out when you leave? Yes, of course. And just so you know, we now weigh the boxes before and after each view. -Sorry? -It's procedure. Yeah, I understand. Okay. Thank you. -So that came across from Customs? -Yeah. It's from the second cache that Wratten led them to find in order to get his Royal Pardon. Dim the lights. Okay, so you see that code? That's the Customs code. They put that on there after they picked up the drugs. And this one, this is our code. From last June, when they sent it over to us. Why did they send it? -Because of this. -What's that? That's the first code, our code. I don't follow. It means this brick has been here before. Which means... Someone took it out. And I know who. It was Detective Sergeant Delaney. Go on. Delaney heard someone was buying large amounts off the street. So he decided to get himself involved in the second purchase by raiding the evidence room. How was he to know that what he sold was destined to go to Customs? And once they'd read the serial numbers they'd send it back to us? -Us? -To him. Do you know how much Delaney took? So you agree it was Delaney? Because that's the bit I didn't have a join for. But now I do. Do you know how much was taken? Well, Customs says there were 12 more in the same series. 26 kilos. And what's that? Half a million quid right out of this department. Ouch. -So he and your predecessor... -Penney. ...decided to cover it up. So you offered to cut Delaney a deal, rap his knuckles, strip him a rank and give him to me, to put him back in line. Which is exactly what you did. Well, that's not how it worked out is it, sir? Because no matter how much you try and bury a past, it has that nasty habit of catching up with you. And is that what happened to me, is it? Did I just get caught in the crossfire? Shh. You really don't know? But you know what? I think now is the time to tell me. Then I'm afraid, Gabriel, the past is also about to catch up with you. It was 30 kilos in total, 30. And guess where the last four were found? In the back of the car in which you both got shot. You may have started out getting Delaney to walk the line, but it looks to me like he ended up pulling you into the shadows. And you're right. £500,000 at least, and you know what? We only ever got back 270. -And why didn't you go looking for it? -No need. Believe me, absolutely none. But you don't remember, do you? I thought you did. I thought you were faking it, that's why I wanted you out. But he thought you didn't. -Which is why I wanted you back in. -Why? He thought if you knew anything, then obviously you'd keep it a secret, or at least show us who you shared it with. And if you didn't, it would come to this. Either way, it would never come out. Is that right? You're a good cop, Jonah. Shut up! You're working together? Oh, no. He works for me. And so do you. I don't think so. Where are you going to go with this? Over my head? I might hit a wall but sooner or later I'll find a gate. And what are you going to tell them when you do? How you forgot to log the operation on the night you went out with Delaney? Why didn't you do that, Jonah? Unless you didn't want anyone else to know where you were? That's got to look shady in anyone's book. You'll end up in jail. With you in the cell next door, sir. And all of us without our pension. So what's your wife going to do then? Especially now you've got a baby on the way? Good news travels fast. Bad news we can bury. I'm not one of you. But you don't know that, though, do you? Because you can't remember. And going by the evidence, I'd say that's exactly who you are. Listen, you're fine. In fact, you're better than that. A cop with no faults, how does he know where to find other people's? Now, let's be clear. I'm saying we should all move on now. All together. Because frankly, what other choice do we have? It's the shadow line, Jonah. It's where we walk. (DOOR BANGS SHUT) You know the biggest mistake you just fucking made? Going to him. If you'd just come to me, you'll still be on this case. -What as? Another bent copper? -That's not the fucking story! -Then what is the fucking story? -I don't know! (EXHALES) That's what I wanted you to find out. And now we're both out in the fucking cold. Congratulations, Jonah Gabriel. You finally managed to close this case. Bob. I brought Jay here to reassure you. How is that going to work? The line of yours the police picked up. He didn't tell them where to look. -You think? -I know. Because believe me, he had nothing to gain. Unless he thought I killed his uncle. What? You lot think I had Harvey Wratten killed, don't you? -I don't think anything. -Is that because you know? -Because I don't think about it at all. -What about him? He doesn't think about it, either. He just wants this deal done. I brought him here to tell you that. "Bob Harris says hello"? Isn't that what you think that driver of yours heard Harvey's killer say? It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that we do this deal. Does it matter to you? You thinking I'm the killer of your uncle, does it matter? Does it? Yes, it does. If I were you, son, it would matter to me, too. So even if you said it didn't, I wouldn't have believed you. Either way, the deal is off. We're ready to go. Find another shell. This one's not for cracking. Ricardo. (ENGINE STARTS) So what do you think they'll do? Fall apart. What about us? Pick up the pieces. (LAUGHS) You make things sound so simple. It's alljust numbers, isn't it? Right now, theirs don't add up. Simple as that. You like figures, don't you, Mr Bede? They're all there on the page. Easy to read, right there in black and white. Isn't that right? As long as they all add up. What about your figures? Do they add up? No. Not yet. -Why not? -Bob Harris. He was meant to be here with you. And now he won't be. Why not? He thinks he was being set up. Why? He heard we think it was him had Harvey Wratten killed. -And did he? -I don't care. But that's what he heard. So he's pulled out. Because he thinks this was a trap? -Yes. -Hmm. So you've come here to tell me the truth because you think I'll respect that? Yes. That's how it worked out last time. Hmm. So what do you want to do now? Stick to the plan. Because you like the plan? Yes, I do. But right now you owe me one million and in four days' time, if we stick to the plan, you'll owe me four million with no means to pay. But in three months you'll have turned over 10 million and all our debts will be cleared. Only if your plan works out. It will. How can you be so certain? Because that's how it has to be. Hmm. Your wife is ill? -Yes. -You're doing this for her? -Yes. -I understand. So in three months' time, if your plan fails, she will be dead. But this is not something you will hear about because I will have killed you first. Is that black and white enough for you? -It is. -Good. So we stick to the plan. You'll get your delivery. And you had better find a buyer quick. -I will. -Good. (MOBILE RINGING) -Hello? -This is Peter Glickman. Yes? Are you alone? Yes. Can I trust you? Yes. Hello, Joseph. Peter. Is it layered? Dead drop. Have you checked it? Only that it's there. It is. -Thank you. -You forgot to pay your bill. It's in the salt pot. Not for this. For Bulkat Babur, you owe him a million. Once this is done. Oh, it's already doing. We opened up the line. We just brought in the first shipment. Who's your end buyer? Then how come you've brought it in? Good luck. I wouldn't need it if you'd paid before you left. There's a lot of things we don't think we need until it's too late. Would you include Petra Maylor in that? How? She found me. How? You should have paid for your flowers, too. What did she want? You. She mustn't know we've met, her life will be in danger if she does. So is mine, now that we have. Tell no one. Trust no one who asks. Those shipments that got Harvey out of jail. -Mmm? -Who'd you find to buy them off Harris? -Why do you want to know? -Would he buy off me? If I were you, I'd sell to anyone but him. But if I had to, where would I find him? You won't. -Why not? -Because I'm going to find him first. Where have you been? Why do you want to know? There's someone here who wants to talk to you. Who? I want to buy your shipment. You're looking to move 250 kilos at four grand a corner, correct? Five. (LAUGHS) Yeah, I thought you might say that. There's five million in those two bags there. Not a penny more. So, are we done? Where'd you get it from? -Why do you need to know? -That's a big bank you're drawing off. Maybe I've got rising stock. Yeah. So who sold your shares? Why do you care? You'll take what you get given. And all you need to know is I'm willing to give it to you. And I hear you've got more to come, 500 kilos. I'll take that off you as well, same price, 10 million. And including this, that's a 15 million deal. Lottery numbers. (LAUGHS) And I'm the one holding the balls. So? You work for Bob Harris... More a marriage of convenience. Mmm. Which you want out of. Why? Maybe we're not laughing like we used to. Or maybe somebody else caught your eye. And now I'm trying to catch yours. You should be flattered 'cause you've got no one else to dance with. How did Harris hear what our driver said? -How do you think? -Because it's true? Because it's true. So why'd he do it? It was Wratten did it to himself. You were going to give up all that money to buy drugs just to dump them on the cops? I mean, it's not exactly the sharpest deal I've ever heard of, now is it? It got him out of jail. Yeah, but what did he have when he left? Nothing. So why bother to kill him? You go down, someone's going to take you out. Oh, right. Tooth and claw. In our world, granddad, there's no such thing as the welfare state. And if you're not careful, that is exactly what is going to happen to you. How? Harris is expecting you to default on the Babur deal, then Babur will knock you out, then Harris will step in and pick up the pieces. -Who are you working for? -Why do you keep asking me that? You're the one in trouble, I'm the one that's got 15 million and a way out. What's to talk about? (EXHALES) If I decided to accelerate the pace, could you take the 500 kilos in one go? Yeah. I'd need five million up front. I can handle that. -And five million on exchange. -I can handle that. Within three weeks? I can handle that. What about Harris? I can handle that, too. -You'll need to. -Oh, I will. Oh, how traditional. Jesus, Joseph. The kid's not even old enough to drive a car. I don't need to, pops. Got someone who does that for me. (SOME ENCHANTED EVENING PLAYING ON STEREO) # Some enchanted evening # You may see a stranger -(KNOCKING ON WINDOW) -# You may see a stranger # Across a crowded room # And somehow you'll know... # What? Yeah, I'm sorry. I need a hand. I can't budge it. That's because you don't jack it up until you've released the nuts. Well, I'm sorry, I've shot me back. -Eh? -I've shot me back. You're good at that. Yeah, right back where I started. (SOME ENCHANTED EVENINGSTILLPLAYING) Go. Come on, you bastard! (CRASHING THUD)
