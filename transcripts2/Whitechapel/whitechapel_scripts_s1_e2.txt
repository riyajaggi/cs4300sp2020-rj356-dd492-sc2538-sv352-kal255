 Whitechapel (2009â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 Despite having given a heads up to Commander Anderson about his theory, DI Chandler is called before a review board after a second murder has taken place. Again, it has all the earmarks of the Jack the Ripper's second murder 100 years ago and appears to vindicate his theory of the copycat killing. DS Miles checks with some of the girls who are on the game and there is a soldier, eventually identified as Pvt. John Leary, who's been roughing some of them up. They bring him in for questioning but he proves less than cooperative. As some of his squad begin to develop at least a modicum of respect for him, Chandler stuns them by coming up with another key piece of evidence: the killers DNA which the pathologist got off the victims eyeballs, the killer having apparently licked them at the time of the murder. With Leary refusing to cooperate, the forensic report on the DNA reveals it to be contaminated and the police are no further ahead. Chandler finds himself under pressure when the media gets hold of his copycat theory and it's apparent that one member of his squad has let the cat out of the bag. On the night of the next expected killing, the police make an arrest and Chandler puts DS Miles in charge of the interview. CCTV footage leads Chandler in a different direction.

 We have a dead woman in Whitechapel. Ready to head up your first murder? Oh, yes. DI Chandler. DS Miles. You worked a murder scene before? I think the killer knelt by her head, then cut her throat left to right with his right hand. The man who killed your lady was copying Jack The Ripper. The man who's attacking these women in 2008 is his biggest fan. We have a copycat. Detach yourself. And if another woman dies? Then, we never had this conversation. You were right. So, all you've got to do now is solve the unsolvable and catch the most famous serial killer ever. I'm here to see the commander. The murder of Alice Graves is an exact recreation

 of the murder of Annie Chapman. Alice Graves was found in a backyard with her throat cut and body horribly mutilated, just like Annie Chapman in 1888. It was virtually identical, down to the date, the time, the things left at her feet, the envelope nearby. The pathologist was sure that whoever did this had no specialist medical knowledge. He can handle a knife and the gore, but he's an amateur, working from coroner's reports of the Ripper's victims. We get the picture, Inspector. If he is copying Jack The Ripper, as you say, then we can expect three more murders. Not if we can stop him. When did you identify this pattern? Eight days ago. And Alice Graves died when?

 Yesterday morning. If you knew a murder was going to happen, we should have been told. It was only a theory up until yesterday. I didn't have any proof. Joe, wait. At least I know where I stand. I'm protecting you. I'm under pressure to replace you with a more senior officer. So, replace me. And when I'm debriefed, don't expect me to lie about what you knew and when you knew it. Fine. Stay on it. But don't run to me once the press get hold of it. My obligation to you ends when it hits the headlines. Good luck, Joe. OK, everyone. Attention! Oh, here we go. Here we have wholemeal salmon sandwiches. Fresh fruit, nuts, juice. Brain food, gentlemen. In the bin. It helps concentration and stamina. Bin. It'll give me wind. Everything gives you wind. Research. Read them carefully. Look for anything to get us inside the killer's head. One of these books is his Bible. I can't remember the last time I read a book. Right. Well, you can have the DVDs. 342 pages?! You can claim overtime for that, Fitz (!) What do we know about Alice Graves? She was 36 years old, she had three children...separated. She saw an alcoholic - and definitely on the game. She was badly bruised around the face sometime before death. Find out who did that and what it was about. Sarah Smith, who found her, must know something. We've got to appeal for witnesses, broaden the enquiry. You can go on TV. No. Yeah. No! I could go. NO! There are three murders to go. We can't let on to the press. It'll create panic. We'll have every crackpot owning up to being Jack and the Home Office will be on our backs. You don't know that'll happen. I do. History tells us so. I know what happens next. I go and get some proper food! I'm getting my bacon roll back. Keep your phone on. Any trouble, call me straight away. She'll be all right. I'll take this one. How's tricks? You know. Seen better. I'll buy you a coffee. You can tell me about it. Fitz, get the SOCO file on Alice Graves. We're up. Sir, can I have a word? Sure. By the way... I saved a book for you. Jill The Ripper. T'riffic. I had a word with Sarah Smith last night. The tom who found the body. She's very jumpy. She said all the girls are. But... there's a regular, a soldier, who's beating girls, threatening to gut them. And get this. He carries a bayonet. Did Sarah Smith give you a name? No. They call him The Squaddie. He's always boasting about how he guards the queen. Sarah said he WAS OK, but he went out to Helmand Province and ain't been the same since. He don't want sex any more. Just gets off on scaring 'em. Only the real desperate toms'll go with him. Fitz? You got that envelope? Yeah. This was found beside the body of Alice Graves. It's the regimental crest from the Household Division, based at Clarence Barracks. We got a prime suspect for you. The guards are on inspection at 3pm. There's no way Sarah would do anything official. This is the best I could manage. Thanks for meeting us, girls. This is my colleague, Detective Inspector Chandler. Ladies. Shall we watch the show. Squad...shun! Squad...stand at ease! Squad...! Third from the right. Shun! That's him. Innit? It's definitely him. Excuse me? DC McCormack. Oh, yes. Er...I got your message. Er, Alice Graves. I pulled her file. Come with me. Oh. She went to the Larkin Trust. Is that a hostel? No, no, no. It's an organisation for women with alcohol problems. It's...a bit out of date. But the address is still good. We need to know about her last admission to A&E.; She came in with facial injuries. Nothing serious. Some bruises sustained in a fight with a client. She was a prostitute. Did she know who the guy was? She was so drunk when she came in, she could hardly speak. But she did say something about... a soldier? OK. Good. Thanks very much. Thank you. Hello! This is unofficial. OK? Purely advisory. Yes, yes. Absolutely. I'll be the very soul of discretion. My Watson to your Holmes, eh? We found this at the scene, with a portion of regimental crest on the envelope... ..which was placed next to Alice's body. There was a torn envelope by Annie Chapman's body, but it was a red herring. It had nothing to do with Jack. The first victim thought her attacker was a soldier. One wound could have been made by a bayonet. And now this regimental mark on the envelope. It all points to the killer being a soldier. He's creating the world for you. The same murders, the same mysterious suspects. The same...mysterious lines of enquiry. He wants you to think he's a soldier, or a man in a leather apron. Because, if you're looking for them, you're not looking for him. He wants to make you his Inspector Abberline. The policeman who couldn't catch the Ripper. Mm. The point of being Jack The Ripper was to get away with it. And never be found. I can't believe the guy's left no trace. We've nothing from Forensics. It's like he knows what we look for and how we find it. Or he's a phantom. Then, the police were so desperate, they even considered photographing the eyes of the victims. They thought their dying retinas might have held an image of the killer. Could you imagine? A picture of Jack in the eyes of the dead. So...what couldn't wait? I wanted to check her eyes. We've gone over every inch of her. There's nothing. Not her eyelids, her eyes. That's off the peg? I know. Got two pairs of trousers, too, to even up the wear. You look like the boss. Nah. His suits are handmade. Savile Row. Wind the skipper up. Your attention, please. Ladies. Private John Leary. History of violence against women. He threatened a teenager with a knife in Germany and he wounded a young woman in Aldershot. His regiment have dealt with everything up until now. They describe him as 'troubled'. Now, his leaves don't tally exactly with the murders, but we can't rule him out. He's a very naughty boy. You get all that, Boss? Yes, I heard. Bring him in. We've found the killer's DNA on Alice Graves, so we'll get a sample from Leary. What DNA? The body was clean? It was on her eyeballs. How did it get there? He wanted to leave his image on her dying eyes. So he licked them. Are you a regular client of prostitutes? - John Leary. Private. 2-4-1-9-6-0-3-4. Did you know the prostitute Alice Graves? John Leary. Private. 2-4-1-9-6-0-3-4. Do you know the crack house near Brick Lane where Alice Graves' body was found? John Leary. Private. Jesus Christ! You haven't been captured by the bloody enemy! This isn't Afghanistan and you're not the bloody SAS! Is this all we'll get? He's not obliged to say anything that may incriminate him. If he wants to play Guantanomo Bay, can we shock his bollocks till he chats? That's not funny, Detective. Oh, really? I'm laughing. You know the house. Did you take Alice there? John Leary. We know! You used to beat her up. Was that not enough for you any more? John Leary. Private. 2-4-1-9-6-0-3-4. 'Private John Leary of the Queen's Foot Guard, based at Clarence Barracks, was arrested by police this afternoon and is being held on suspicion...' We're missing a trick. An appeal on here could jog a few memories, turn up all kinds of witnesses. We've had this through from Forensics. Bayonet's clean. No blood traces at all. Shit! And the eyeball DNA's been contaminated. I've had to release Leary. Leary's not in the clear yet! He just got lucky. What is it, Skip? Eyeball DNA's contaminated. Bayonet's clean. Oh, you're joking! Oh, no! Oh, what? Why is the Director of Forensic Science suddenly signing off on the evidence? Why is he doing labwork? That's unheard of. The director doing labwork? It's a cover-up! Well... The original Jack was a cover-up. In my 342-page book, the original Jack was a Masonic conspiracy to protect the Duke of Clarence. He had married a Catholic whore and the other women were all witnesses at the wedding. Who's the Duke of Clarence? Is that Charles? Charles! No! Listen! The whores were witnesses to a wedding the palace wanted to keep secret. So, the palace had the girls killed. That was the conspiracy then. So, what is it now? If we knew that, it wouldn't be much of a conspiracy. It's just one theory out of hundreds. My book has Jack as a sailor who went to live in Jamaica. In my book, Jack's a woman. Well, maybe, though, the palace has something to hide. Yeah. Hold on a minute. Alice Graves... used this support unit for alchies. And guess who the patron was. Princess Diana. You want a conspiracy? You want a wedding that's been covered up? This...is the mother. Don't mess...with the masons. Leary is a good suspect. We'll get the evidence cos he did it. No-one's covering anything up. So, no more conspiracies, no more masons. And no more Scotch, either. Yes?  'Turn on the news.' '..happened to these murders. The tabloids are reporting that Jack The Ripper is back and killing women again in the east end of London. Sources also suggest that the police, already under fire for being slow to react to the case, are looking into a possible Masonic connection.' 'You have a leak, Sort it out.' 'The murder of Alice Graves is likely to be the second in a series of five planned attacks.' You happy now? What? Someone has compromised the entire investigation. What are you insinuating? You know. I'm not the leak! You wanted rid of me at the start. I'd do that? I am staying till we get an arrest. So, the hell with you. Oi! I've been doing this job for 20 years. I have to trust the loyalty of my men. Would I risk that for a streak of piss like you? You'll screw this investigation up without my help. I will find your leak for you. And you will apologise! I like single malts, not that blended shit. Now that this is out in the open, we'll be inundated with false leads, false confessions and false alarms. Not to mention the public getting in our way. The press are offering cash for clues. They want to beat us to The Ripper. The Home Office is under pressure - and our top brass. Which means that we are under 24-hour scrutiny. We cannot make any mistakes, we cannot be fallible. Fally who? I know there's been talk about conspiracies and masons and cover-ups. I want it to stop now. I want to get back on track. Which is why I've asked an impartial expert to come in and talk to you today. Mr Buchan? Oh, not the Ripperologist! Are you out of your mind? We need an objective view. A step back. Oh, he's a step back all right. It's fine. Should I just begin? Yes. Go ahead. Imagine. Whitechapel, 1888. A place so terrible that Jack London called it the abyss. Ed? Masons. Yes. Yes. There is no conspiracy. The Masonic conspiracy of Jack The Ripper is the biggest load of bunkum ever to taint true Ripperology. Based on a total disregard of the known facts of the case. Crime conspiracy is the last resort of an investigator. It's a way of saying it's not your fault you can't solve it. Yeah, well, why did the director handle the evidence? Huh? Good point. It was a favour to me, actually. I wanted the best. Oi! Eyes front! It doesn't explain the Larkin Trust. Alice Graves. She used to go there. So did Cathy Lane. I checked. May I er...? It's another myth. That the canonical victims knew each other. He'll be recreating pea soupers for us next. Clever boy. You don't have to keep turning them. Let them cook. Oi! I'm still in charge. Who's for another beer? Please, Fitz. No. No, thank you. You found your pub in the country yet? Yeah. Saw a lovely place in Sussex. Don't come cheap. Huh! Tell me about it. We're already remortgaged up to the hilt as it is. Still, the money from the papers must help. Right? What? Is... Is that what I'm about, is it? I'm just saying. I understand why you did it. Can't live your dream on a pension, can you? A few bob in my pocket and screw you guys? Yeah, right (!) I'm outta here. What's up? Where are you going? He thinks I'm the leak. Thinks I sold you out for a few grand. Don't be daft. Come on. Have a beer. They're on me. Since when? Never see your wallet in the bar, do we? Well, it's...just a beer. That's your guilty conscience, Fitz. It's a beer. Come on, Fitz. I can see it in your face. Tell us. I didn't do it for the money. I did it so we could get a new DI. I did it for you, Skip. It's what you wanted, innit? Here. I'm sorry. Hey, Ray! Can I borrow this for further study? I'll return it in the morning. Out of the question. I understand. Absolutely. The double event is imminent. The night Jack killed not one, but two women in the space of 45 minutes. Catherine Eddowes was killed in Mitre Square, on the cobbles. It's the only murder site that still exists - you can stand on that exact spot today. He'll definitely be tempted by that. It's so authentic. There's CCTV in Mitre Square. It's completely overlooked. He wouldn't be so stupid. He'd be caught in minutes. Game over. Hm. Mitre Square's too important to miss - and he gets to take away her kidney. He can't do it. It's impossible. I'd definitely regard Mitre Square as a probable murder site. All right. I'll keep an eye on it. But we're gonna focus on Private Leary. Watch every move he makes. It's not him. He fits the description of Emma Jones's attacker. We know he assaulted Alice Graves before her murder. He's our prime suspect. Well, then you have to ask yourself, will there be a double event or not? What do you mean? There's a growing body of thought that Jack was not responsible for both murders. I thought Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were definite. It's a recent theory, not mainstream. Liz Stride had her throat cut, but she wasn't mutilated. The classic theory is that he must have been disturbed, so found another victim to sate himself. But... No signs of strangulation. The coroner found a dissimilarity with how her throat was cut and believed a different weapon was used. No mutilation, different MO, different signature. Her death could have been a coincidence, wrongly linked to Jack. So, a classic Ripper fan will kill twice, but if it's an alternative theorist, once. In essence, yes. So, which one is he? That's up to you, Joe. You're the expert! But it's your investigation. Oh, Jesus! All I have is... history. I've got...nothing...tangible. Nothing... Nothing right now... right here to help me. I mean... It was a dead woman in Whitechapel, a simple domestic. I wasn't... I'm not supposed to be doing this. Look. My... whole career... ..has been mapped out by other people. Just trying to fast-track me on to... I'm the wrong man for this job. But if we catch this man tomorrow night, you will be the man who captured The Ripper...for ever. No-one catches The Ripper. History says so. Have a good, long look, Mary. Take your time. None of them jump out at me. It was very dark. I only remember seeing the knife. I'm sorry. How about him? Ring any bell? Maybe... It's possible. It could be him. Good girl. Mary's just picked out Leary. That's a positive ID from Mary and Sarah Smith. Good. Let's go ahead with it, then. We need to catch Private Leary in the act. As we know, the time's important to him. If he's our killer, he'll attempt the first murder at 1am tonight in Henrique's Street. McCormack, I want you there. Kent and Sanders, you'll be in Clarence Barracks. The MOD have agreed access, so you can watch the accommodation block. I'll be out front with the boss. The second murder was in Mitre Square at 1:45. There'll no doubt be a public presence of press an onlookers. We'll have uniforms there. And Leary is under observation from now on. Our objective is surveillance. We don't make a move until he does. This is it. No mistakes. When we get Leary, let his nibs read him his rights. Give him his moment. Sorry. All right, darling? You take care tonight, ladies. All quiet here, sir. Kent, only use the radio when something's happening. 'Out.' We're right about Leary? Yeah, we are right. It's the one thing you and I agree on. Mitre Square, please give your situation report. Mitre Square, north side. Everything under control. Over. All right? Fine. Mitre Square. All clear on the south side. Over. McCormack. Situation report. Pissed off...cold... and very thirsty, sir. Shit. We're up. 'Suspect in military clothing.' He's coming down the scaffolding. 'Rear of the barracks.' 'OK. All units, here we go.' Suspect is AWOL. On the move. Heading towards you, Kent. He has a bag. Kent? Have you got him in sight? 'Kent! Have you got him in sight?' Trailing suspect on foot. 'Kent. Situation report.' 'For God's sake, Kent. Can you see him?' Suspect is heading towards perimeter wall near you, sir. 'Now wearing a baseball cap and a dark jacket.' He's got accomplices. It IS a bloody conspiracy. We're on the move. He's got into a dark car. Can't read the registration. Looks like two male IC-1s with him. He must be heading for the kill. Tailing suspect heading west. All units, stand by. This doesn't make sense. It's the wrong direction! The murder sites are east! He's trying to lose us. Well, stick with him! What do you think I'm doing?! He's messing with us. What's he doing now? He's turning back! Trailing suspect east. All units, stand by. Trailing suspect east. What's going on? What's he playing at? Are you trying to frame Private Leary? 'This is Mitre Square. We've had a disturbance.' It's the bloody press. We've been set up. Yet you're no closer to catching the murderer. There's a disturbance at Mitre Square, but no-one's been killed. Out of the way! Move! Police! Please! For God's sake! Joe! Thank God! Joe! Is anybody in the square? IS ANYBODY IN THE SQUARE? It's Mary. He got Mary. This is impossible. There's nobody here! He ain't human. He can't be. Joe... Thank God. I didn't get their numbers, but I wish to lodge a complaint. Joe? I want to complain against the two gorillas who arrested me and threw me in the van. Mother'll be in a terrible state, wondering where I am. Joe, do you think I could have my laces back? Not yet, Mr Buchan. This way, Mr Buchan. Oh. I see. Where were you at 1:30am this morning? I was staking out the exact spot where Catherine Eddowes was murdered in 1888. You were hiding from the police. I wanted to catch The Ripper. I've been hunting him all my life, and now here he is again, made flesh. He is my nemesis. He's mine to bring to justice. So, that's why you wanted to help. To get an inside track on the investigation of yourself. I'm sorry, Joe. Having committed the offence of obstruction by entering a restricted area, you were escorted from the square at 1:41am. By the gorillas. Correct. Was there anyone else in the actual square? No. Look. I caused a bit of a ruckus and I'm sorry about that. But...he didn't even show up. So, no harm done, eh? At 1:45 am... the body of a woman was found in Mitre Square. The body of a woman? That's impossible. He...he couldn't have. There was no time. He had four minutes. But - All he needed was a distraction! Like the mini riot that you caused. Me? You think he used me? You made it possible! His accomplice! I am Edward Buchan, respected authority on Jack The Ripper. I am not a killer. Nor do I serve one. How dare you? Mrs Buchan? Police. We have a warrant to search yours and your son's premises. May I come in? He subscribes to Caravan International. Looks like he pays his bills on time. Yeah, course he does. He's a saint. He's in a dispute with the council... over a neighbour's plans for an extension. I mean, it's not really... Well, where's all the Ripper stuff, then? I thought he was the world's foremost expert. Does he keep it all in his head? Mrs Buchan? Mrs Buchan, what's down here? Oh, that's my son's study. I haven't got a key. Got a screwdriver? Ta very much. Bloody hell. I knew it. It's like an incident room - from 1888. It's a killer's lair. Look at all this. He's a Ripperologist. This is what he does for a living. He's even got his own website. Look. This ain't from 1888. He was helping the investigation. This doesn't prove anything. He's involved. I'll prove it. I've got a nose for this. You haven't - obviously! He cut her throat first. It's savage. Right through to the vertebrae. The abdomen has been completely opened up. There's a stab wound in the liver. Genital mutilation. The colon's been cut away and the kidney and uterus have been removed. Exactly the same as Catherine Eddowes in 1888. However, when you come to her face, the injuries are completely different. There were V-shaped marks made on Catherine Eddowes. Whereas here... Well, he's clearly tried to slice Mary's face off. In my experience, this kind of severe facial mutilation strongly indicates a relationship between the killer and his victim. They may well have known each other. Catherine Eddowes said she knew who The Ripper was and would claim the reward. Mary Bousfield got a good look at Cathy Lane's killer. And he got a good look at her, too. Bastard! What have we got? OK. This is the CCTV from Mitre Square. It shows all eight cameras from both the north and south sides. Here, on the south side, they find Buchan hiding and make the arrest, taking him around the square to the north side. All the press and onlookers follow Buchan's arrest, leaving the south side clear. This creates a diversion for the killer to dump Mary's body. He enters the square through these shutters on the south-east corner and drags Mary's body into the square. Jesus! We were minutes away. The shutters here lead to an underground car park entered from Fenchurch Street. We're getting the tapes from the council. He must have used a vehicle for his getaway. Excellent work. Thank you, sir. I have the printouts from Buchan's message boards. It worked like this. Someone - Jack2000 or Springhill - would ask a question about the murders. Like, was there a double event? Buchan gives some longwinded answer, then somebody else writes in - Slasher Jack, with a different theory - Buchan replies, on and on and on it goes. How many people were on the site? About 100. But look at this. One name had a regular Q&A; with our friend Buchan. 50 times more than any other user. I told you. I got a nose for this. Can Computer Crime trace this? They can try. But look. The last contact was on the night of the first murder. You do Buchan's interviews from now on. Yes, sir. I owe you a bottle. (Yeah.) You haven't shaved. Sorry, sir. I haven't been home yet. You look like a drowning man. Everything's under control. Many would like your place at this table - you could at least change your shirt. Why did you ask me here? I gave your late father my word. A place at the table. In time, at the top of the force. But in the current climate... I have my own position to consider. I did warn you. I understand. You need to take a step back. Unless I catch The Ripper, in which case, you'll be standing by my side. Nobody asked you to sacrifice yourself. Work the shift, go home. You have a sergeant. Use him. Let him shoulder it. Protect yourself enough that, when it's over, you still have some standing. Do you even know their names? Whose names? The victims! Your problem is, you can't see it's irrelevant. Mary Bousfield. He cut out her kidney and sliced her face off! We are eating! I do apologise. Where is Detective Inspector Chandler? Busy. Ripperfan. Oh. The message boards. I've no inkling as to who these people are. You're happy to discuss how to cut up women with 'em. I simply relate the historical facts to them and, if necessary, correct their thinking. Read it. "An inch below the crease of the thigh was a cut extending from the anterior spine of the ileum obliquely down the inner side of - " The left thigh. Yes. Yes. That is from the autopsy performed by Dr Brown on Catherine Eddowes - That...is murder pornography. This information is in the public domain. I don't tell them what to do with it. Someone like Ripperfan... who is so interested in your opinion of the double event... ..and shared your belief that Catherine Eddowes was the only Ripper victim that night - I know what you're implying. You think he's the killer and I'm in it with him. Why would I do that? Tell me about marks on Catherine Eddowes' face. Well...OK. The autopsy report states that she had distinctive marks to her face. Like erm...inverted Vs on her cheeks. And the tip of her nose was cut off, as well as cuts to her eyelids. Some Ripperologists think that these are Masonic markings. But you've got your own theory. Well, yes, I do. I think he tried to cut Catherine's face off. You see, cutting down like so would cut the eyelids, remove the nose and cut into the cheek. I can't be certain, but it does make sense. Yeah, it does. It did to Ripperfan. Cos he did exactly what you told him to. He sliced Mary's face off. Ripperfan's the killer. And you're his, what? Mentor? Sounding board? Special advisor? You tell me. The CCTV from the car park in Fenchurch Street shows a van. It's from A C Maduro, Health And Safety, a small medical supply company. The MD is a Mr Maduro. He's stopped all his vans, but he's not happy at all. If such a murder had occurred in one of my vans, I would have noticed. The vans are clean. There is no blood. You'll have to just bear with us, please, sir. I need my vans back on the road. We supply organ transportation. Not just body bags and rubber gloves. And we have urgent medical transfers. Over here! Positive signs of blood all over this van. We've got a murder scene! I want a thorough search of this van. What do you want? I asked to see Joe. Well, you've got me. So, I am the lowest of the low now. I don't have to be here, you know. What do you want? Please. Stand back! Ask Joe, has the killer sent the kidney yet? Mary Bousfield's kidney? It's bound to be the next step. He'll post it to someone involved in the hunt. Someone he regards as his nemesis. Who was driving this van the night before last? I'll have to check. I have my own filing system. It's a bit complex. Sir? These were in the van. Contact Fire Investigation. Chase up which accelerant was used in the fire. Sure. Sir? It's for you, Dad. Have you got his pen, Jamie? Will you stop? Get ready. Out! Out! Everybody out! OUT! We have two days until he copies the murder of Mary Kelly. The murder could happen anywhere. The next victim will have red hair? Get Tactical there. We'll meet you there. transcript:chocolate sync:innuit www.tvsubtitles.net
