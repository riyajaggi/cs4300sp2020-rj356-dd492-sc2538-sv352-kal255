 A common name. It's a great name. I rode with Benito Vega for many years. And now you work for a ranger Captain. The wars are over. Where is he? Do you know Montana? He went back? He only stayed one night. He's crazy-- Captain Call. Whole damn rivers to cross. He said I should go, too. I've crossed too many rivers already. People leave...

Hold your horses. Help you? Thought you might help me find Gideon Walker. Gideon Walker? I don't guess we know him. Gideon Walker, Texas rangers. Heard he was here-- San Antonio. Oh. That feller-- He claims he was a ranger. Was a ranger. Rode with Captain Augustus McCrae. One of the finest to answer the call. If you say so. I do say so. No offense, mister-- Just seems peculiar. Why's that? Man who fought all the battles He claims he has Being a dressmaker. Dressmaker? Oh...oh...oh... we really shouldn't be doing this. I'd like to speak to Gideon Walker. He is busy, senor. He is in the fitting room. It's 3:00! My husband--He's gonna pick me up at 3:00. Is Mrs. Wentworth ready? She is in the fitting room. Mrs. Wentworth? Hello, dear. Thank you so much, Mr. Walker. I do appreciate your getting right to it. Always a pleasure, ma'am. Mr. Wentworth, Sure do envy you your banker's hours. Do you need a deposit on the dress? No, no. No, sir. I trust you. Oh, my god. Captain Call. Ranger Walker. What a sorry sight you are. Captain? Captain. Don't judge me too harshly. Good thing Gus ain't around to see what you come to. It's all just my grief showing. My wife died 4 months ago, And I've been hurting for a woman's touch. Well, I am sorry to hear that. But like they say, As you sow, so shall you reap. I believe that's a true statement. Let me buy you a drink. We'll set and talk. After all, it's been some time. Captain... may we just have a talk? Me and Dolly wasn't married 6 months. She got hit by a runaway freight wagon. It happened right here-- Right out in front On the way to the dress shop. Ah... she died instant. Lost a wife and inherited a business All in a blink. It's a good business-- Dressmaker. Gideon Walker... you are in a different world. Same world, Captain. Different times. Gus used to say, "a man's like a river. "Got to keep on flowing Where the force of nature takes you." You must miss old Gus. To Captain Augustus McCrae. To the sunny slopes long ago. Had an idea you might help me Run some mustangs up to Montana 'Cause it was you first Showed me the herd that time-- You and Augustus. No point to that now, Seeing you are as I find you, But I am fixing to take that herd. That's fine, Captain. I appreciate you even considered Telling me about it. Besides, I'm through with ranching. I do wish you'd, uh, Reconsider your feelings about me, though. I know I must look a little funny here But after all, I'm just a human. You, too, Woodrow. No offense, But you made your mistakes, too. What about that whore Maggie You throwed that child with? What was his name? Newt, wasn't it? We just had our last conversation For quite some time. Oh, now, wait, Captain. Mr. Walker... I owe you something for my wife's dress. Drop it. Drop that pistol! He missed! He missed it, Woodrow! He missed my bean by two inches! Yes, sir, I'm all right. I'm going to be all right...oh! What's all that commotion out there? Did you get my buggy? Doctor's downstairs Holding back quite a little crowd-- All concerned at the health Of your private parts, I reckon. Hand me those clothes. Although just how private Them parts are is a question, ain't it? Untie this thing, will you? Woodrow... I gotta get out of here Before someone else finishes the job, For if the truth be known, I--I've sold quite a few dresses lately. Please, give me a hand with this thing. Might be I ought to just let you sit In the smell of your own cooking for a while. I've learned my lesson, Woodrow. I've learned it well and good. Now please, help me with this. Ow! I'd forgotten How truly perverse you can be. Put your pants on. Jim, lift up your side a little. Stop it there. Lippy, bring your side up some. Hold it there. Well, the... "Hat Creek Cattle Company." That's us. You can't read, Pete. How the hell you know that's what she wrote? Reads the same as it did On Gus' sign, And I read it just how I remembered it was. Jim, lift your side up tad bit. Good! Hold it there. Tie it off. You comprende, Lippy? Hell, Lippy can't read neither. People know where they're going. Don't need a sign to tell them where they got. That don't make no sense! This ain't the Hat Creek! We are 200 rivers north of the god-dang Hat Creek! That's who we are. It says so right up there to prove it. Hey, Ben, spike them posts good and hard on the downhill slopes. Snow comes, it'll catch drifts. I ain't no sod buster. I'm a top hand. I didn't sign on and drive cattle all the way to the Milk River to wind up digging in the dirt and hammering nails. You're not doing nothing The rest of us ain't doing, Jasper. Well, I don't see Newt swinging no hammer. Newt's range boss. Captain said. Come and get it! I wonder where the Captain is now. I wonder when he's coming back. How do we know he's coming back at all? The Captain always comes back. Gus didn't. That was different. Well, how is it any different? It's the same trail, Same Indians, same damn rivers, And he's trying it twice as many times as we did. Odds are twice as high he's got Twice as many arrows in him as Gus had. Jasper! Don't be carrying on that way About the Captain. No more. Indians? Get your horses! All right, it's coming from the south! Get your guns too! Come on! Help us out, boys! Hyah! Hyah! Who's shooting? Rustlers, in that draw. Someone up that hill, shooting at them. Come on, boys. Aah! I got him! Get the hell out of here! Here, 2 more. I see 'em. Running iron. They were changing brands, all right. This one here is "circle K." Must be that spread north of here-- Kenilworth. Oh, there's one of ours. Soofilly caught one right through the throat, Newt. Petey, boys, keep an eye on that hill. Look around. Are you hit? What are you staring at? You never seen tit before? How bad is it? It's just a scratch. Here. Son of a bitch. We got to get you to Mile City--A doc. Just take me home. Where's that? Kenilworth. I took that off a Sioux chief. He tried to ram it through me. So you're Dobbs? Yes, sir. Gregor Dunnegan. Mr. Dunnegan. People call me Newt. What do you drink, Newt? Well, I don't much, really. I was born lucky, Newt. But you doing what you did today Was as big a piece of luck as I've known. I love that girl more than life. We just heard the shots. Nonsense. You rode to them. Too many thieving bastards Forcing their way into Montana right now. Single malt, scottish whiskey. It smells like heaven, tastes like honey. Bold deeds, good neighbors. Cheers. Ahh. What's the matter? I never tasted honey like that before. Them bees must have left their stingers in it. Hmm. So... you're a Texan. Yes, sir. Awbonnie? Is that cowboy who brought me back Still here? With Mr. Dunnegan. All right, will you bring me My brush and my mirror? Oh, you need rest. No, I've got thanks to say. Will you just get them for me? And let Mr. Dunnegan know That I'm ready to see him, all right? Yes, ma'am. All right, thank you. 3,000 miles. That's a hell of a drive. Yes, sir. This, uh, man you work for-- Call, is it? Captain Call. Army man? Texas rangers. Finest mounted fighters ever was, I'm told. I wouldn't know, sir. Are you a Texas ranger, Newt? No, sir. Did you bring any Texas rangers with you? Well, Pea Eye and Needle rangered some. Pea eye? Needle? And Gus-- Captain McCrae. But he died. And so did Deets. An Indian killed him With a lance like that one. And Jake Spoon-- The Captain hanged him. Hung one of his own men, did he? Jake went off on his own, Fell in with some killers. I ain't exactly sure what happened, But I watched the Captain hang him. Sounds like a hard man, this Captain. Yes, sir. But he's fair. And you're loyal. I like that. Mr. Dunnegan. miss tucker Want to see that boy. I think I should be Getting back to the outfit now. Oh, no, no--I can't have you doing that. You leave without seeing her-- There'll be hell to pay. Here, come on. Ferris. It's good to see you're better, sweetheart. Thank you. Oh, I knew you'd want to have A few words with Mr. Dobbs. I'll go and see about dinner, hmm? All right. Ma'am. It's Ferris. Yes, ma'am... I mean--I mean, Ferris, ma'am. Look, I'm happy you ain't hurt so bad, But I should be getting back to my outfit now. Oh, you can't. Why not? Because I said. See, that's how it works around here. Whatever I say, goes. Did you ever feel a featherbed? Feathers? No, ma'am. Well, come see how it feels. I thought cowboys Were supposed to be bold and daring. Some, I guess. So what happened to you? I don't know, ma'am. Listen... you saved my life. You got a job here as long as you want one. Well, thank you, but I have a job. Why, this is the biggest ranch in Montana. We got furnishing from europe And a private library as good as any in Boston. That's not good enough for you? It's fine. It's just... ju- Are you sure you don't want to see How this feels? Come on. Golly, it's soft. It's nice. Does anyone feel like eating? I got to ride. That's nonsense, Newt. If you think we'll let you go On an empty stomach, You certainly don't know me. And you certainly don't know my wife. Whoa. Reminds me of the first time we found this valley. We was pretty much running free as they was, back then, Sowing our oats where we pleased. You was, anyway, I'm sure. That was on our way back from that trouble down south With that gal old Gus was so stuck on. What was her name? The one with the bandit brother? Serena Vega. That's it. Serena. There was nothing serene About her, though. She was as wild as any filly out there. Oh, hell, Woodrow. I'm sorry. Long time ago. So you really want to drive These mustangs to Montana. Free for the taking. That taking ain't going to be easy. Ain't nothing worth doing That's easy. What give you this idea, cap'n? All them graves, I reckon. A man should leave more behind Than an old board hammered into a sorry piece of dirt. What is it exactly you plan on leaving behind? Real cow pony-- One that hits full run in a few strides, Holds speed a good distance. You see a horse like that down there? What I see don't exist yet, But you cross them Sure-footed little fireballs With some rugged Spanish stock, Throw in some high-strung racers out of England They're breeding down in kentucky, You got it. I see the mustangs. Where you going to get blooded racing stock in Texas? We're a long way from Kentucky. Nebraska. Clara Allen. You mend fences with her? As I recall, you were never the best of friends. I got a plan for that. Clara Allen's got a bunch of blooded mares She's been breeding colts out of from Spanish studs. You add a mustang to that, You might have the perfect horse. The kind of horses you're talking about Ought to be worth something In a new cow country like Montana. That's what I've been thinking. I'd surely like to go along on this. Well, I ain't fixing On joining up the drive till Nebraska. Well, I will heal up shortly and be fit in every way. But, uh... how would we push these mustangs all the way to Montana? I got just the man for that. Mama! Mama! Coming. I got the last load before we eat. Captain Call?! Nathan! Howdy! Sarah, ma'am. This here's Nathan, the little one. Remember the baby? And Lizzy. Can't believe how they growed. Elizabeth, that bag on the pack horse Is for you and your mama. Yes, sir. Isom's on a horse, as usual. Young 'un, take these reins. Mutual friend of ours Had a dress shop going out of business. Oh. Look, mama. Oh, look at that! Ain't that pretty. Boy... I'm getting a little old for that. Isom Pickett... you ain't changed at all. Captain Call. Come on. Let's get us some coffee. Who you making that telegram for, Captain? Newt. Oh, how's Newt? Ahem. Been some time. I left him in Montana, in charge. I'm certain all is well. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. Want him to meet me at Clara Allen's in Ogalla... how do you spell Ogallala? Huh. I don't, generally. Uh... o... g... l--a... I plan for Newt to get me a good price From Clara Allen. She favors the boy. Least she has in the past. How much they charge for these telegrams anyway? They charge by the word, don't they? By the word? By the letter, maybe. No, each word. So... Mustang Valley, huh? Going to take that bunch all the way up to Montana. Yeah, that's the idea. What you think about that? Well, could be done. Heard mustangs are a little tricky, though. Gideon Walker, right now, picking up a trail crew. What about your brother Isaac? He's the one. I was hoping you would ramrod this operation for me. But it is dangerous work Driving through the nations. I won't be with you till Nebraska, probably. Cap'n, you want me to leave all of this here For steady work and steady wages? What's Montana like, Captain? Oh, it's... it's purty as... your smile, ma'am. Well, I guess we just have to Go on up there and see. Hmm? Right. I'd like to thank you boys For turning out. What about the jobs? I'm sorry, son. I need more experience. Mister, we've been pushing cows since we could set a saddle. Well, we're driving wild horses this time. Just how much experience you need? I'm looking for some other qualities as well. We shoot as good as we ride. I don't doubt that. Where do you come off Looking down your nose at us? This won't get you nowhere, son. I ain't your son. I ain't no damn farm boy Who's going to tuck his tail 'tween his legs And slink off neither. I meant no offense... and I'll take none if you let me buy you And your friend here a drink. You had 2 good legs, we'd find out who's better. I think not. You ain't nothing but a crippled coward. Here, I'll buy you that drink anyway. Those men deserve what they got. Well, I wished I'd have handled that different, But I lost my temper. You are going to Montana? Yes, ma'am. With horses. That's right. You and Captain McCrae Had a great success in Montana. Cap'n McCrae? Si­. I hear how you brought him back After he was dead. Everybody has. And now you need men, And I know where there are men who need work. Where is that? Just across the river. Mexicans? A good vaquero is worth 2 of your Texas cowboys. Better with horses. Everybody knows that, too. Captain Call. Well, I give you what you say About good vaqueros when you see them, But I must correct you on one point. My name is Walker. Gideon Walker. They told me Captain Call was hiring men. I work with Captain Call. Where is he? Why? It doesn't matter. Do you have a name, senorita? Agostina. You coming? Hey, Agostina! Agostina viene con un gringo en una carreta. You live here? I work here. What kind of work? Anything I can to help. Good enough? You say you work. What do you do? I ride with them. I can rope. And I'm good with business, too. So, do we have a deal? I'm just thinking How Captain Call's going to receive A bunch of Mexicans and a woman, too. Hellfire, I'll tell you that. Carlos, ven aqui­. Gideon Walker, Carlos Herrera. These are his men. Buenos di­as, senor. Sus hombres son muy buenos, Carlos. Gracias. This is Carlos' mother Juana and his children, Miguel, Sofia, and Eduardo. Salude al senor Walker. Hola, senor Walker. Hola, senor. Oh, no. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Looky there. Always a pretty sight, ain't it? Different from cows. Ain't nothing easy about this trail, Isom. Weather, injuns, rustlers. Likely get your fill of all. Well, looky here. My brother Isaac. The only one he'd ever come out of the hills for is Sara. How'd she ever find him, I'd like to know. Now where is he going? He don't burn much daylight. He didn't even stop to say howdy. No. Not to us. Now will you look at that. They ain't even moving. I can't hardly believe my eyes what I'm seeing now. Is that him? It is. Howdy, Woodrow. I was looking for half a dozen good men. Yes, sir. You got them. Plus Agostina here. Rides like the wind. Throws a mean loop to boot. I might have knowed it'd go to this. Before you go getting all frothy, It ain't what you think. He was looking for better men Than he could find in Texas. It was a sorry lot in San Antone-- Boys, mostly, and a bunch of mean-eyed types You wouldn't trust as far as you could spit. These men know horses. And you know yourself, Woodrow, There would be no cowboys in Texas or anywhere else If it weren't for their kind. Who's numero uno here? What's your name? ¿como se llama? Carlos Herrera. Carlos Herrera... let me see that rifle. Who belongs to grandma and them kids? This is Carlos's mother. Her name is Juana. The children belong to Carlos. Carlos's wife is dead. He won't go without the children. Juana takes care of them. Good piece. It will do some work. Nice and clean. If Carlos don't go, neither do the vaqueros. I've been over this with the girl. These men are top-notch. I've seen them work. And crack shots, too-- Every one of them. Except grandma. Maybe. Capitan. Driving wild horses is not driving cows. These men are not cowboys. They're horsemen. Where did you learn your English? The sisters at Santa Clarissa's. I was raised there. Convent school. I, too, can outride your cowboys. Captain, their village is poor. The wages these men send back Will keep women and children alive. They's Mexicans. Where we going, nobody speaks Mexican. How they gonna look after their selves? They're gonna be with us. We ain't got time to nursemaid people Who don't even know what the hell We're talking about anyway. They can learn like any other people can. I will teach them. Captain, you are right. It will be hard enough for them In a strange place. By the time we get to Montana, They will know English. We'll just see about that. We'll see about all that. Well, I seen your surprise. Now you come see mine. Y'all, stay here. Here he is. Big as life. Damn it all, Woodrow. You said you got us a good top hand, Not some bald-headed horse thief. Now, now. You better watch who you calling bald-headed. I might have to put a hole in that other leg now. Good to see you again, Isom. You, too, Gideon. That's some herd, ain't it? You bet. I judge they're good horsemen... good men, too. They sit real straight in the saddle. And them children, they, uh... would be good for Nathan and Lizzie. Well, it's all done then, I reckon. Hope you brushed up on your sign language. Newt? Newt? Got that from the Captain. That Mr. Kruger give it to me. Said missus forgot it was in there. Well, you forgot something, ain't you, Pea? What? We need somebody to read it for us. Well, it ain't for me. Got your name on there-- Never mind. Um, Gregor? I think I'll go over To the general store for a minute. All right. I'll be here. All right. Howdy, ma'am. Newt. Howdy. It's good to see you. Yes, ma'am. I thought we got past that. Ferris. This here's Pea Eye Parker. Hi. Howdy. So, did you get a telegram? Just now. It's good news, I hope. Well, I don't know. I was heading over to the sheriff To see if he... was going to the sheriff... it's from Texas. Captain Woodrow Call. I know that. I know. Would you like me to read it for you? Well... here. "Newt, meet me, Clara Allen's, Ogallala. "Take Jasper. "Leave Pea in charge. Captain Woodrow F. Call." Were you expecting something else? No. Thank you. You'll be leaving, then. I suppose. Well, travel safely. Yes, ma'am. Ferris... Ma'am. I--I will. I hope to see you when you get back. I do, too. Get up! Get up! Newt, why you reckon the Captain said Take Jasper and not me? 'Cause he wants you in charge. He knows Jasper'd give you nothing but trouble. Lord, I wish it was one of the other boys. As I recall, Captain done all the thinking for us. And you doing good when you been doing it. Lord, I don't believe I-- I trust you as much as the Captain, Pea. More, even. 'Cause you ain't never held nothing back from me. You're an honest man, Pea. Remember how Gus used to say the worst an honest man can do Is make an honest mistake? A mistake's a mistake, the Captain said. Like he ain't never made one. But he has, Pea. He has. When was that, Newt? Day I was born. That brother of yours beats all. Yep. He's pretty interesting, all right. Getting that horse pretty good. Keep a proper distance from that girl, now. You getting ready to pull out? Might as well ride hot as cold. Meet you up at Clara Allen's. Mm-hmm. Stay west of the nations. Keep a good eye out, daylight and night. Might be Kiowa or Cheyenne roaming around. You best take a piece of your own advice, Captain. We gonna get all these mustangs to Ogallala-- All of them. See you there, then. Vaya con dios, capitan! English! Don't spook this horse If you want to chew with a full set of teeth. What you all lathered up about? Uh, telegram from Texas. Whoa, whoa. From Captain Call. Woodrow Call. I think he wants a pear. No? Boy, worth something to see, huh? A herd of wild mustangs. I have seen them. So many-- Look like the whole country was running. Yeah. I went through the stock And picked out some good mares And I thought maybe That big chestnut from Kentucky Might interest the Captain for stud. No need to spend time on that. Well, didn't Captain say He was going to want to buy breeders When he gets here? Girls, he's had enough. Why don't you get him cleaned up and tucked in For me, will you? He's rather fragrant. It's all right, mama. He's just-- Now. Clara... that chestnut's going to sire some good colts And he'd do real well by the Captain. Why he thinks I'd sell him my best stock's a mystery to me. We have better things to do Than to break our necks Getting ready for him to show up. He's not been invited, and he's not welcome. I don't need to be attended to. Going to be some lonesome nights Till we get to Nebraska. At least we ain't pushing cows. We ain't poking nothing, neither. 'Less'n we decide to stop in Miles City on the way-- Have us a little night to remember. We got country to cross, Jasper. Them girls at Squirrel Tooth Betty's Ain't too shiny, But they can damn sure show a man a good time. Not this trip. The Captain's waiting on us. Ain't you your own man, Newt? Just one night. You been there? Hell, yeah, I've been there. Man been in Montana for a year Ain't been to Squirrel Tooth Betty's. Hell, Newt, as fresh as you are, They'll probably pay us. Ok. Let's go. One night. Come on, git up! I had no idea there were so many people in Montana. Aye, unfortunately. You don't suppose it's the celestial violins That attracts them, do you? Free land attracts them. Any man with a long rope and enough nerve Has all the capital he needs to thrive here. It can be carved up By little men with little dreams Within the blink of an eye And your investment along with it, gentlemen. Yes, but what do you propose to do about it? This is rather a large territory. You can't police it all. When enough people come They'll cry out for statehood. They'll carve up your empire Into little pieces eventually, Wouldn't you say? Not as long as I'm here, they won't. If you two wish to protect your investment Then I need all the support I can get. I'll lead the way. All you two have got to do is have the courage to follow. Do you understand me? Well, howdy, cowboys. Whoo, whoo, whoo. Bottle of whisky for me and my friend. Water for our horses And a little bitty missy for the dogs. A whole bottle? Hell, yeah. Grab them glasses, Newt. We ain't here for a long time. We're here for a good time. I don't think that whole bottle Will make any of them Look like bluebonnet flowers. Oh, yeah? Well, they look a whole lot better Through the bottom of a glass. Hey, you've been here before. Yes, ma'am. Ooh! Jasper Ferris. This here is Newt-dog. Newt is cute. Be careful, girls. Old Newt's a bad hombre from Hat Creek. Oh, where's that? You don't know where Hat Creek is? Hell, girl, everybody knows where Hat Creek is. It's in Texas! Are you really a bad man, honey? Ah... the further up the creek they live The badder they get, and old Newt-- He lives in a camp way past the last cabin. Hell, he was raised by a she-wolf-- Teethed on mesquite. Me and you was going upstairs. You was too busy getting drunk. Well, I'm drunk enough now. Come on. No. We're talking to these boys From...Texas! Right! Texas? Hell, I knew I smelled cow flop. Now, let's go. Come on. Come on. Ow! All right! Ouch! Turn her loose. What? Turn her loose 'fore I turn you loose From your teeth. Stomp him, Jasper. Oh! He's going to be hurting tomorrow. Turn around! Nobody spits on me. Jasper... pull it! Newt?! Come on, Newt! Newt! Don't do it! Newt?! Newt! What are you doing? We gotta cross this river. They're right behind us. Probably. You seen it, Newt. I just did what I had to do. I saw you gun a man in cold blood. Better you took the thrashing Than kill a man that spit on you. Yeah, well, you shot, too. I had to! Damn you, Jasper! You feel that way maybe you shouldn't run with me. Maybe I shouldn't 'a. it's hard to think when you just shot a man. He'd strung you up, Newt, and you know it. You don't wanna die. Just get on that horse and let's cross this river, And keep goin' till dark. No. I ain't runnin' no more. The only thing I did wrong was run. I don't think they'll hang me for that. Well, you're a fool. They ain't gonna listen to us. We don't know anybody back there. Where you going? I'm goin' back. What?! You'll leave me? Huh? You'll run out on your old buddy? After all we come through together, All the way from Texas? I guess we don't see it the same, Jasper. It's about as wrong as running gets. I ain't scared of you. Yellow. Newt. Newt! Newt. What's gonna happen to you? Don't seem as ever nobody can say. Howdy. Where you headed? Yonder. Noticed. You picnicking? Join me. Thanks all the same. Going back to Montana now, Captain? I know you someplace? You a famous man. Ranger. Trailblazer. Crazy damn thing you did, Bringing a man back 3,000 miles to bury him. Some say. Good-looking animal. Always heard-- Woodrow Call knows horses. Nice-looking paint. Fancy rig, too. A man from the nations partial to silver-- Black like you. Daddy was a buffalo soldier name of Jackson. His mama took up With the Cherokees after he died. Raised up a real sick stone-cold killer. Goes by the name Cherokee Jack. I done something to offend you, Captain? You're an offense To the whole civilized world, Cherokee. UnBuckle it. Careful now. You might say something I'll take personal. Wouldn't that just break my heart in two. Ain't too late to forget we ever met. Like to, but I can't. Drop it there. Too bad. We'll be gone before whoever you're waiting for shows. Mount up. We going someplace special, Captain? Nearest army post, Fort Dodge. Reckon they'll be happier to see you than I am. We're 40 miles east. Hate to take you so far out your way. Try not to concern yourself. Move. You know the way. Well, it ain't right about Frank. No, it ain't. Who's this? You one of them Hat Creek boys? Yes, sir, I am. You tell them inside to say their prayers 'Cause we're going to send them both to hell. Newt, I got here as quick as I could. Hold it. Let's have that gun. Easy. There's a line on the floor. Don't go no closer. Howdy, Pea. Good to see you, Newt. You go blind, Pea? We're in jail. They're probably gonna hang us. I was talking to Newt. Well, good, then. You keep it that ways. What do you want to do? I don't know, Pea. I'm thinking on it. I wish the Captain was here.

Comes another one. Civilized world of yours, Captain. We ain't part of it. Now you take all the time you need To think it over, But that's my price. Boy, it's an awful stiff price... but they are good horses. What'd you get, July? Well, I think there's a letter here For you and your mama. Chola, take the Captain over to the north range. Show him our 3-Year-olds. Si, senora. Mama, mama! July says there's a letter from Lorena. Let me carry it. Let me! Come on, girls, don't argue, don't argue. Sally, give that to me. Come on, give it to me. What's it say, mama? Yeah, what does it say? "My dearest family..." heh. "I have at last arrived in San Francisco. "Much of what it took to get here "Was probably at too great a cost, "But I'm here nonetheless. "I was surprised by dish in Salt Lake "And finally convinced him that no event in nature "Could make me content to be his woman. "Though he is a true friend, "I cannot force myself to love him "So he has gone away. "The money from Gus allows me to live "In a comfortable fashion, "And I am obliged to Mrs. McDonald, my landlady, "For setting down these words for me. "I've missed all of you every minute I've been away, "So it should not surprise you "That one day you'll look up "And there I'll be, the gal from the big city, Your faithful friend, Lorena Wood." Mama, is Lorena coming back now? No, honey. She always dreamed of going there. Probably some time before she gets her fill. Read it again, mama. Oh, mama, I wanna go visit her. Listen to me, both of you, listen to me, shh! Shh, shh, shh! If you care for someone, you truly care for 'em, You gotta set 'em free. But you always keep 'em in your heart, you see? That's where they live. You understand what I'm saying? Good, 'cause next time I'm missin' her You remind me, all right? Go on. Go get the supplies. I'll get the flour sacks. I'll put away the apples. Ma'am, this come, too. And I just thought better Of giving it to you in front of the girls. And a telegram never seem to bring good news. Oh, lord. Newt's got in some trouble. He's locked up in jail With another one of the Captain's boys. In jail? For a dull man, Woodrow manages to stir up a heap of trouble. Them boys out there want to hang us. One damn sheriff ain't gonna stop 'em. Newt? You hear me, Newt? At about dark-thirty you and me better think Of some way to get out of here. You saw what happened, Mr. Dunnegan! We'll back you up! Ben... you can let these two out. Well, these boys Don't work for you, Mr. Dunnegan. Oh, well, but they're going to. I saw what happened. Those two men deserved what they got. I still got my job to do, Mr. Dunnegan. I can't let nobody go unless the judge says so. Ben, I've got a wire here May get you to change your mind. The governor...? Well-- Well, he still ain't a judge, sir. And-- And those fellows outside are-- Tell me, Ben How much is this shotgun worth? Well, that old thing... maybe $20 when I bought it. Well, seeing as how you got a telegram and all From the governor... they're in my parole, Ben. You can let them out. There they are! What the hell's going on here? Now you bring those two out here, Or we're coming in after them! These men work for Mr. Dunnegan. They're Hat Creek boys. They don't work for Dunnegan! The governor is paroling them into his care. What's the governor have to do with it?! You can't do this. Now, you gentlemen saw what happened Back there in the saloon, didn't you? And you know those two boys Got what they deserved. Well, let me tell you something. If you come here to get these men, Then you've got to kill me first. Do you hear me? Your horses are at the livery. You can saddle them. Mr. Dunnigan, sir, I owe you my life. I saw you back at the saloon. You do that again and I'm gonna shoot you. Yes, sir. Saw you two. I told you before, I admire loyalty in a boy. I admire it more when it's better placed. What happened to the men we shot? One died immediately, Yours took a little longer. Now, go get your horses. Uh, breakfast is at sunrise. Work finishes at dark. Newt... come here. Is it your first killing, boy? Aye. You did what you had to do. Put it behind you. Jasper! Whoo hoo hoo! You bet. Let's go! Whoo! You talk Kiowa, Captain? It's just as good you don't. I grew up with Indians. One thing about them-- They always playing games. Even when they become men Always playing games. Well, they got plans for you. It's called "honey pot." What they do is They bury a man... all but his head Beside an anthill. Smeared over with honey. On your mouth... your nose... ...and your ears. Then slit your lids So you don't miss nothing. But you don't have to worry about that. I says to them It's too easy for a man like you-- Ranger... famous Indian fighter. I say to them They should show you some respect. Let you run... arrows. Run hard, ranger! Go. Run, ranger. Come on!
