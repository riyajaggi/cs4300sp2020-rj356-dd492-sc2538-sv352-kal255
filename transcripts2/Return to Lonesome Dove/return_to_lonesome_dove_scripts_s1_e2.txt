 Near as I figure, We're pretty close to the nations. A herd this size ain't gonna go unnoticed. We best break out the extra hardware When we bed down tonight. We got a river up ahead. Good. We'll camp there. In the morning, we'll follow the riverbed So we don't kick up no dust. It forks left, And it carries all the way to the Canadian.

 Amigo, could be one of them times When we find out what your vaqueros is made of. We'll see. Come on, Dolly. Move on, move on. Come on, Dolly. Get on up there, girl. Get on up there. Hey, Sara. Get on--Yeah? Whoa! Whoa! Where are the kids? Oh, they're having fun. Made some friends... learning Spanish. Hey, that's good. Here's Isaac's food.

 What's in it? Now, you just let it be. Poor man, he can't wash, he can't talk. Least he might as well say he eats good. Yah! Where's Isom going? He's got his brother's supper. He's gonna stash it in the trees up ahead So's that Isaac can pick it up Without getting too near any of us And taking the human smell back to the herd. They trust him completely. Well, he won their confidence slow and easy. Takes them to fresh grass. he leads them to water. I imagine right about now, they'd follow him anywhere. Must be good to feel that safe with someone. Have you never felt that way with a man before? A man? No. Not even your pa? I never knew him. My mother was killed when I was 6. I'm sorry. Bad memories. White man. Hurt. Ohh! Hurt. Aah! I need... horse. What happen...you? I run... arrows...Kiowa. I need a horse. Always nice and cool down in that cellar. There's lightning. It's out to the north, but, uh... still no sign of rain. Now, there's some useful information. Would you ever marry me? Have a taste, July. I think I've overdone the cinnamon. You don't have to repeat yourself. I heard you. You going to give me an opinion On this cinnamon or not? Tastes fine. I don't think you're much of a judge of sweets. If you're done cradlin' those potatoes, You might lavish some of that attention On your son. He's been fretful lately. Martin. Martin? Come on, baby. Up. Up, up, up. Ohh! Yeah, there. Papa... Pistol don't work. Broke, see? I need...good rifle. Sister. Lodge empty. Husband die. Greasy grass. Sons die. Running face sickness. I don't need no woman. You need horse. You want? You take woman, too. I can't care for her. You come without fear. She trust you. I can't. Must be. I...not live long. Protect my people. You done right by me. I owe you. Of course, it don't change who I am. You fight my people. All my life. Comanche, Kiowa, Mescalero Apache. I ain't never been a friend to your people. I take many scalps... like yours. But always with honor. Do you not fight with honor? I do. Then our hearts have same scar. I lead my people From camps where trust die, Where our spirits die. I could not let my son See me do nothing. I honor my father's deeds. My sons honor my deeds. That is how honor... is kept. In our way, It goes on... in our children. Howdy. Found you. Mr. Dunnigan need me? Guess he wouldn't have hauled you out of jail If he didn't think so. You hungry? I got food. Not like what I brought. You like peaches? Well, sure. How about cherry tarts? I don't mind tarts. Well, you better 'Cause I brought a whole mess of 'em. The roof looks nice. Thank you. I saw it needed fixin'. Gregor says you're the hardest worker He's ever seen. Haven't seen enough of you to say for myself. I've been busy. You've been hidin'. Now come over here Before these peaches spoil. You got nothin' to be ashamed of, Newt. Those men were outlaws. The same breed's been stealin' our stock To start up their own outfits. They'd still be in jail otherwise, No matter how much influence Gregor has. I guess. Well, I know. So what do you think? Of what? The operation-- Kenilworth. Oh, it's--it's big. Heh. I remember the first time I saw it. Where I came from, it looked like heaven. Pretty close. Heh. Awbonnie! Where's Ferris? Riding. Do you think it's strange? What's that? Gregor and I. No. Liar. Everybody thinks it's strange, But they don't know him, And they don't know me. He's the first man I could ever trust. Can I trust you, Newt? I guess. I think so, too. You know, what you did for me took guts. What you did for your friend Jasper, too, Though I don't see Why you put your life on the line for him. He doesn't seem like the type To do the same for you. Well, we come a long way together. That's worth something. You good friends? Like I said, we come a long way together. Newt... will you be my friend? I need a friend. Sometimes I think I'm gonna go crazy without one. Sometimes I miss the girls Back at Harvey's so bad. That's the place I worked in Kansas city When Gregor found me. I love Gregor... but he's so old. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's just... sometimes he makes me feel so old, too, you know? Guess you wouldn't. Pea eye, my best friend, he's old. I don't like feeling old. But I guess it's better than feeling used, The way other men made me feel. Does that make any sense at all? I don't know. Sometimes I think I've gone crazy And I just don't know it yet. You ain't crazy. Bolivar--Our cook back in Lonesome Dove-- Now, he got crazy sometimes. He talked to hisself... to the wind. Whacked an old bell for no reason. Now, he was crazy. You ain't at all like that. Lonesome Dove? Where's that? Oh, Texas. You miss it? Well, it wasn't much of a place, really... Here, try this one. It's got more bang in it. Whoa. There you go. Thank you, Newt. Thank you for lunch. Did you get it fixed? Yes, sir. I believe it'll shed water. You're in good company, I see. Yes, sir. I want you to go into town for me. Whilst you're there, you can get yourself A new saddle, bridle, bit... whatever else you might need. How much is in here? What you don't spend You can bring back, can't you? Mr. Dunnigan, sir... I don't need nothing. I'll just do my job. Nonsense, lad. You represent me now. Your appearance must reflect your status, Mustn't it? Hmm? Away with you. Go on. Yes, sir. That was awful generous of you. He'll pay me back. He's honorable. Come on. There anything you want me to do? Well, I guess the doctor Will be gettin' here soon. The doctor might be goin' In the other direction. This'll be over before he gets here. He'll have had the ride for nothin'. You mean, the baby's dyin'? I mean, he'll either die or get well Before the doctor comes. I done all I can. The rest is up to Martin. I hate it when a child's sick. I loathe it. I get too scared. It's like there's somethin' That don't want me to get a boy raised. He'll be fine. Shall I, uh, Fetch you some coffee, or... I know my way to the kitchen well enough. You'd have done better to talk to me When I needed it. I guess I'm-- I'm just no talker. You're not much of anything. But you could be. I know you're smart 'cause Martin is, And he didn't get it all from your poor wife. But a fence post is more useful generally Than you are. Well, I've tried to help around the place. I'm not talkin' about chores. I'm talkin' about us. I sit here alone all night in this room With your baby. Where were you? Uh... ohh. I wish now that I'd been here with you. I told you how sickness frightens me. The only times I've ever wanted to die Is when I've had to sit and watch a child suffer. I don't want the girls to be here 'Cause I don't want 'em to get death Too much in their minds. I sat here and I thought, "I'm alone." And I can't help this child. If it wants to die, I can't stop it. I can love it till I bleed, And it won't stop it. I hope it won't die. I hope it can grow up and have its time. I know... if I lose one more child, I'll never care again. I won't. Nothin' will make any difference to me again If I lose one more. It'll ruin me, And that will ruin my girls. I'll never buy another horse, Or cook another meal, Or take another man, or... or I'll starve, Or I'll go crazy and welcome it, Or I'll-- I'll kill the doctor for not comin', Or you for not sittin' with me. If you wanted to marry me... why didn't you stay and sit? Would you have ever married me then? I mean... you never said. Oh, July. If we were in love, we'd both know it. I think you're mistaking affection For love. I was in love once. That's it for me. I'd like to go on bein' friends. Yes, ma'am. We'll be friends. That's fine. Mama... look. Indians. No. Only the woman. I'll be damned. Be obliged for water for the horses And the woman. Ma'am. Captain. Newt here? No. I told him to meet me. You come down from your horse. We'll get you out of those clothes And into a soak. Then we'll talk. You remember July Johnson? Hello, Captain. July, show him the bath house. I'll get the beds ready And see to the woman. Cholo. Si. Well, what happened to you? Took a fall. You still haven't exactly said Why you've taken such a fancy To Newt Dobbs. Neither have you, lass. But with the trouble that's coming, We're going to need the loyalty Of every young man That's not afraid to use a gun. What do you mean? Nature. Living out here where nature can't be tamed Has taught me one thing. To stand an even chance, one's got to plan ahead. I don't understand. You will. This Newt Dobbs, He's got some rough edges Need polishing. I want you to sit him down, Teach him to read, Do numbers. See if he's got the knack. Oh, and while you're at it, You can pick him out some clothes. The ones that he's wearing Looks as if they're hand-me-downs. Why are you asking me to do all this? I've got a feeling about him. I think he's got promise. Gregor... I love you. I love you, too, lass. More than the morning sun. Looks like you lost some weight out there. Brought you some of Bob's clothes When you're ready. Finally put them to some use. Your wife's sleeping. First time she ever saw a bed. I ain't married. I know Cheyenne custom. You traded for her; she's yours. And proud of it too. You don't know nothing of the kind. She told me quite a lot. Far as I can tell, her name is many tears. Sounds about right. Seems she's had enough hard times. She says you came into her people's camp Half-naked and unafraid. Well, she got that first part right. How did that come about? She don't speak no English. How'd she come to tell you all this? I've traded with the Cheyenne too. She says you been good to her. I'm sure you'll be very happy together. I see why you and gus were such a pair. You both enjoy laughin' at others' expense. I see whatever calamity you walked into Hasn't changed your disposition any. I pity many tears. It's a sad woman needs anything from you. I didn't want to tell you right off 'Cause of your condition But something's happened with Newt. This came. You ought to have told me. Now if you'll step from this room... I'll dress to leave. I... I was fixing to buy some of your better stock. Isom Pickett and Gideon Walker Will be along shortly. I appreciate you have them take a look for me. No sense looking. You won't be buying. I can send money just as soon as I get to Montana. I don't want your money. Why's that? I don't need it that bad. There's no excuse for bad manners. I... I owe you an apology. Just the way it's always been between us. So you won't even let me say I'm sorry. We say good-bye. Neither one of us have a problem with that. Fine, but I want your woman to stay. Thank you. Welcome. I'll have Cholo saddle a horse. And we'll take good care of your wife for you. I'll send payment for all this When I get to Montana. Do right by giving Newt your name at long last. That'll be payment enough. Woman, how come you give my brother more food Than you give me? I work much harder than he does. Now, just hush and go hang this on Isaac's tree. Here. Bye. They're almost letting us in with them tonight. Well, we come a lot of miles together. Maybe they're getting to like us. There he is. Nothing against your brother, Isom, But I don't want to get caught downwind of him Till he gets to a bathhouse. La chiva. Como se dice en Aleman? Aleman, no, no, no. Ingles. La noche esta oscura, si? Como se dice en Ingles? Carlos. La noche esta oscura. The...night... si. is... dark. Si! Muy bien! Si, the night is dark. Gracias. Thank you, Carlos. Ahora. Now...the moon. Howdy. Over here. Whoa. Don't mean to spook you. That's close enough. Don't mean no harm. Food for your mustanger? I've seen that done before. Spare anything from your cook wagon For a hungry traveler? We'll go over nice and easy So as no one gets nervous but me. Good night, Nathan. Good night, Lizzie. Good night, mama. Got any food left over For a hungry stray, Sara? Biscuits still hot. Mustangs, you say. Unbroke. Meaning they ain't worth nothing To a horse thief. Not unless he was willing to work at breaking them. Most horse thieves ain't that interested in work, I've noticed. Maybe being a horse thief is work enough. just trying to get a smile, Mr. Walker. How is it you know my name? Gideon Walker-- Ranger with Captain Woodrow Call And Augustus McCrae. Made Texas safe for plain folk. Like her and me. Ain't that right, sister? True enough... Mr. Jackson. Cherokee Jack Jackson. Some people call me that. My mama, She called me Jackie boy. Maybe she ain't heard you got a price on your head. Not in the nations, sister. White man's law don't mean a damn here. It does in this camp. Relax, walker. If I'd known mustangs was here, I'd have stayed in my squaw's bed. Well, we won't keep you up any longer, Jackie boy. Heh. No, you won't. Real good coffee, sister. Real nice smile, too, I bet, When it comes out. Let's go. Good luck, Walker. Most men in the nations Can't be as choosy as me about their work. Anybody hits this herd will be hanged. Heh heh heh heh. The Mexicans fight, can they? They've been fightin' Comanches for centuries. They seem like real soft people. Especially that sweet little teacher. I may not be the law here, but by god, You are within a hair of losin' your worthless life. You pull it, you'll be a long time Runnin' down those worthless broom tails. Don't that break your code, ranger? Ain't I supposed to be standin' And facin' you? Go on. Get up. You owe me for a good gun. You go now. What is it? I just had a disturbing encounter With an infamous bastard By the name of Cherokee Jack. In camp? It was Sara who told me who he was. Where is she? She's all right. She's at the wagon. We'd best go find Isaac. He should be eating that food you hung up for him. Let's go. Come on, giddy-up. Come on. It ain't like him to be so finicky. Isaac! What did she put in there be so leaky? Isom... your brother and me... we never even said hello. I've never felt more guilty About a man's dying. Don't. I can't hold you responsible. I'm going to go get him. No. He's mine. You can't take that away from me. First, I got to finish what Isaac started. Hyah. He's doing it. Looks like. Now you're going to do something for me. What? You find yourself some loose-fitting clothes. You cut that hair. Why? Every man sees you, including that dark Indian, Takes notice. We got enough trouble with nature out here. I don't want to go courting any other kind. I can take care of myself. You whack off that hair, Or I'll whack it off for you. Senor walker! I appreciate you cutting your hair, But I'm afraid you wouldn't fool A blind man. Sara needs you. What for? The children are sick. They all have fever. She's over by the wagon. It's bad, Gideon. He's got fever, chills. His stomach hurts him something awful, And everything's running right through him. Is it all the children? Si. Everyone except for Lizzie. But they were playing together. I don't know what it is. It could be they got some bad food or water. It happened a lot in the army. Doctors call it dysentery. Is he going to die? Not if we keep good water Flushing through him and I can get To Fort Wallace and back quick enough. What's there? They should have a supply Of something called laudanum. It comes from opium. It slows up the gut. I will go. I won't let you ride alone. It will be faster. I don't care. I've been riding alone all my life. Those are my people. They must be protected. They need you here. All right. Look it there. What's a greaser doing this far north? Corporal, I'm glad you're here. This young man's party Is a half a day's ride to the west. This is an authorization for medicine To be taken to them. I want you to give it to the O.D. In the infirmary. Pick a man to ride escort with you. Ahem-- I'll go. Fine. Set out on the double. Sir. How come you jumped at this duty? You hate them damn mexicans worse than I do. I never knowed a blue-eyed senorita before. Take a look. Take a good look. That face ain't never seen a razor. When was the last time you saw a backside like that Walking around on a man? You ready? I'm ready. You ready, Johnson? Let's get moving. Whoa! Ho! Why are we stopping? What's the matter? Picked up a pebble, got to work it out. Well, we might as well take this opportunity To rest in the shade while we got it. Give me the medicine. I will go alone. I'm afraid we can't do that. The medicine's U.S. property. Yeah, the lieutenant said We were supposed to dispense it ourselves And bring back the rest. No, my people need the medicine now. You won't need that. Come on down, chiquita. Them clothes can't hide what you got under them. Please don't do this. My people are very sick. Your people... are dirt. But you got the makings of a damn fine poke. No, no...go away. Leave. You are right. But why make it unpleasant, huh? I like big, strong soldiers. I've had many like you. Damn. Come on, chiquita. Come on down. Hey... hey! Hey. Come here. No, no, no. Wait, wait. Shh! Wait a minute. I want to play a little game with you, ok? Just watch me. I want to show you something. Huh? Look at me. Look at me. First, I will show you. Then you show me. You like this game, huh? Norteamericanos... You are so...big. I'll show you something big, chiquita! Gringos. Did you get it? How are the children? They're pretty dried out. This will ease their pain, though. You did fine. Woodrow Call, Hat Creek outfit. You got one of my boys, Newt Dobbs, locked up? Another named Jasper Fant? They each shot a man. I'll speak to them now. Can't do it. They're gone now. You saying... they's hanged? Like to come to that. Before somebody could do it, they was paroled. Mr. Gregor Dunnigan. Who's that? You just fall from a tree? The most powerful man in the territory-- Kenilworth spread. Had instructions from the governor. Out of my hands. Paroled, you say? Yes, sir. Mr. Gregor Dunnigan. Obliged to you. Captain's back! Yee-Hoo! C-Captain? Well, Captain, I swear, I ain't never been so tickled To see nobody in all my days. Where's Newt? Newt? He's, uh.... well...he ain't with us no more. Why? They hang him? Did they hang him? You said he's gone. H-He is, but he ain't. Gone from the ranch. He ain't hanged. Dang it, Pea. How did you let the boy get into all this? I left him in your care. I made a telegraph. Get your horse. Yes, sir. Poor folks really roughing it, ain't they, Pea? Ain't seen nothing like it in all my life. Howdy, Pea. Captain. Howdy, Newt. Didn't know you were back, Captain. I'd have been over. Got yourself all cleaned up. It's real good to see the both of you. Where's your friend Jasper? He's out riding the line. He'll be back. What was you two doing in a saloon When I told you to meet me at Clara's? Captain, I'm real sorry about that. You can't know how sorry I am. Sorry don't get it. You had a job to do. Yes, sir. Jasper and me figured We'd spend a night in Miles City. Jasper wasn't range boss. You was. Yes, sir. It was all my fault, But I never figured on... I'm listening. How was I supposed to know, Captain? Can't you be happy I didn't get my neck stretched by a rope? Newt Is my horse ready? Yes, Ferris. Uh, Ferris, this is Captain Call. Ferris Dunnigan. Miss Dunnigan. Ma'am. Actually, it's Mrs. Dunnigan, Captain. Newt's told me How much he admires you. And Pea Eye, Newt says You're a real good friend. Thank you, ma'am. I trust you two will stay for a meal And meet my husband later. Thanks for the invite. Kind of you. Meanwhile, Newt, why don't you Fill him in on all the excitement. You ready to ride? Mm-hmm. It's good to meet you all. She part of all this parole you're on? Maybe Mr. Dunnigan Might can explain it better. No, you can explain it all you like On the way back to Hat Creek. We're going now. Afraid I won't be. I'll talk to Mr. Dunnigan first. Got yourself in real deep, didn't you? I owe him, Captain. Newt, you still got your job, You get on your horse right now. Come on, Pea. Boy's head's all turned around. Lord, Newt. I swear... Ho! Ho! Ho! What was that all about? He just wanted to make sure things was all right. Creek up ahead to the right. Got some good high ground for you on the other side. What's for supper tonight? I call it Sara's surprise. I can't wait. Hyah! That lieutenant said that 2 men he sent with you Were gunned down. Said he found them in a stand of trees. Funny thing is, they were, uh, all stripped down to their drawers for some reason. He was curious if you knew how it happened. I told him there was no way you could since you were here with me When his men left to go back to the fort. Senor Walker-- I can't talk now. I gotta show Isom that creek. Lizzie, see if they need more coffee. Gracias. You never killed before? No. Well, it's not like you planned it. May God forgive me. There's no need to whip yourself. I can imagine what happened. But I have wanted... I have planned to kill... I have thought that killing Would not be enough. Gringos? Rangers? I've known a few I thought about plugging myself. There's an ugly breed That gets drawn to that line of work sometimes. Was Augustus McCrae one of them? Why can't you leave old Gus be? I keep telling you they don't come No higher caliber than him. I rode with Gus. I trusted him in all ways. I wish... I wish that it was that easy... what? To trust. You know, we keep an eye on the sky awhile, We just might see a shooting star. It's the season. If we do, you make that wish. Might come true. You never know. Speaking of Gus, One night, me and him were sitting in a spot Just about like this On a night just about like this, And we both saw this old star go whizzing overhead Streaked across the sky from east to west Like some great rocket on the fourth of July And we both made a wish at the same time. Go on. Well, we had one star, but we had 2 wishes. Now you got to figure That one of us made our wish quicker than the other. Could have been me, could have been old Gus. So whose do you think come true? Yours? Nope. His. What was that? That someday, he'd have a child... a child with his courage And a burning curiosity about him And everything he ever did or was. Don't touch me. All I meant to do was give you My shoulder to lean on. Same as your daddy would if he was here. I hope Augustus McCrae burns in hell. "Come back, come back, He cried in...grife"? No, that's "grief." Well, if it's "cried," Why ain't it "grife"? Why isn't it? Because "i" before "e" Is usually an "ee" sound. A long "i" sound like "cried" Or "died" or "lied," that's an exception. Are you paying attention? I'm trying to. Is the shirt I picked out for you? I washed it for the lesson. It's nice. It suits you. I never had nothing this nice before. Neither had I until I met Gregor. Gave me everything I thought I wanted. What do you want, Newt? I just want things to be right. Did you ever want something so bad You'd do anything to get it? I want to talk to Captain Call. About what? How much I owe Mr. Dunnigan, Why I'm here. He thinks it's because of you. Is it? I don't want him thinking that. Well, you better tell Gregor first. Newt, come in, lad. What's on your mind? Captain Call, sir. Now, I owe him a powerful lot, too. I'd like to get straight with him. I thought I'd ride over. Captain Call doesn't seem to be A very reasonable man. Well, he's got a narrow set of rules, And I broke 'em awful bad. Tell me, has he ever talked to you About becoming a Peace officer again? No, sir. He's given over to ranching For good, I believe. That's a pity. A man as hard as that Could be useful to the future of Montana. How do you figure, sir? This has always been a wild country, Newt. All these freebooters moving in, Filling up all the-- All the land. There needs to be some rules and regulations, A new sense of order. There's got to be somebody To enforce that sense of order. So you ride out to Captain Call, You tell him that he's invited to join our roundup With all the other big spreads in the area. Hmm? You tell him that he's more than welcome. Oh, he ain't much for big groups, sir. I think it's important Meet the other people In the area-- In the territory, hmm? Find out who his friends are. I know you'll make that very plain to him. Yes, sir. I'll try, sir. Good man. Newt come back. Newt's here! Newt. Hey, Ben, Newt's come back! Neil, Lippy, it's been a long time. Newt. How you doing? Pea, it's good to see you. Captain? I need to talk to you some more, Just try to set things straight a little. Mrs. Dunnigan and I are friends, But I ain't there because of her. Explain quitting the job I give you. I didn't quit. Me and Jasper was in jail. They was gonna hang us. I sent you a telegram. Then Mr. Dunnigan come in And said we was paroled to him. How'd you get in jail? I tried to explain it to you-- You're gonna judge me as hard as you judged Jake Spoon the day you hung him, aren't you? There's lots of Jake Spoon in your behavior. You might turn out just like him. You saying Jake's my pa, Captain? Well, I'd a hell of a lot rathered It was Jake than you 'Cause Jake knew people could make mistakes. Like my momma the day she made me-- With you or Jake Or somebody I don't even know. So if you're thinking I'm a bad seed, You go right ahead because it's probably the truth. And if I'm your seed, it's dead certain. That's what you come to say? You said it. Mr. Dunnigan's having A big roundup at Kenilworth. All the big outfits throwing in together. That's what I come to say. You be on your way. Pea... boys... I hold nothing against any of you. You're all my friends. But I ride for Mr. Dunnigan now. And that might come to mean We've seen things the same way For the last time. Adios. Let's get to work. Ain't no law against work. Hyah! Yah! Yah! Senora! July, come quick! Sally! Betsy! Get out of the house! Drive the horses to the north range. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Aah. Sally! Sally! Where are you?! Betsy! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Come on! Whoa! Aah! Unh! Unh!
