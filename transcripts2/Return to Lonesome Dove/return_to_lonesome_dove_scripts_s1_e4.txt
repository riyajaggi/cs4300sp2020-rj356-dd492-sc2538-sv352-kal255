 Many tears, can you do this for me? Bet this is more than you thought you were bitin' off. Don't recall what I thought. Might as well get this said. We have a problem. Never had much else. Agostina is Gus' daughter. She's gotta be taken care of proper. We owe that to Gus. Now, you're gonna see to it, and so am I. Knowing you, Woodrow,

 You're gonna have to chew on this a while, So I'll be waitin'. I believe I'll go on, put your stallion up. Vega. Agostina Vega. Serena Vega was your mother? Yes. The woman you killed. She stepped out in front of a bandit, should've died. She saved her brother's life. A man who robbed, burned, murdered On both sides of the border, Even his own people. I did nothing that night wouldn't do again.

 Pull it. He would have. Where was my father that night? Back in Bravo, fighting a fever From a bullet your bandit uncle put in him 3 days afore. Did he talk about my mother to you...ever? He did, as I recall. What did he say? Many things. And that he felt love for her. He told you that? Hell, old Gus said he loved someone every other week. Have to say he meant it that time, though. Didn't talk to me over a year After I told him She stopped a bullet from my colt. My uncle told me that he raped her. Agostina. Who give you that name? My mother. Tells you all you need to know, don't it? Did he know? Did he know about me? If he had...we'd have met a long time ago. There aren't any beds. This place is pretty homey for Woodrow. These boys have been here over a year, And they're still sleepin' on the floor. Got a roof-- Somethin' to keep the wind off 'em. Sorta. It's deplorable. Well, you can be certain of one thing, Clara. What's that? I'm damn sure gonna see you get a bed. I just thought you should know. I got me a new partner, which is... the daughter of Augustus McCrae. That's fine. That's just fine. Well, that's it, then. Well, I swear. I supposed you'd be leavin', too. Ladies. How long you figure it'd take to build a house? Had a house. Then you turned this place Into a home for widows and orphans. I mean a real house, like the one Clare had. I got good hands here now. Got some mouths to feed, is what we got. Gotta admit that music's soothin'. I don't admit that... and you don't want me to, neither. Why's that? I did, the argument'd be over. A man might even get some sleep. No. No. Not here. You belong with the women. In the house. It's warm in the house. Get on down there. Go on. Well, suit yourself. Hell of a night, Woodrow. You wonder how many stars is up there? You start countin'... better dang well beat yourself. Take them. It's Danley and Logan. Let 'em go. But they shot 2 of our men! We can't risk any more. No. We can't leave Danley and Logan. Newt! You heard what I said. That's him, all right. I'd heard he'd moved north. Who? Cherokee Jackson. Killer... from the Indian nations. What about our cows? We got more cows, Newt. You and the men mean a hell of a lot more to me. Come on. I want to get these two back to headquarters. Hyah! Newt. You may be a harder judge than I am. You want me to back off from what we just saw? I don't think you want me runnin' anythin' around here. You want justice. So do I. But it's gotta be regulated. When the governor hears there's an outlaw As savage as the man we just seen on the run, Then he'll have to back my idea for a militia. Then... we'll get the help that we need. Where I come from, we did our own regulatin'. I'm tryin' to get you To think a little broader than that. We got to set rules For an entire territory right here. Don't you se?, We could've chased those men down And strung 'em up to a tree... but what about the next rustling? And the one after that? Hmm? And so on? Hey. We've got to use this situation To set a precedent That will not be forgotten in my lifetime. Maybe not even in yours. Don't you understand that, Newt? I'm tryin' to. You're a good man. You're a good man! Hold onto him! Hold onto him! Hang with him! She rides just as good as the men, daddy. Sure does. Maybe better, if you ask me. Hoo! Ohh! !Andale, andale! Hang with him! All right! She has more respect for him, too. Respect for a horse? Sure. Want a horse to be gentle, You be gentle. Want a horse to be confident, You got to be confident. Horses likes a rider that sits on him. Nervous rider... don't know what to say. Horses don't talk, dad. Oh, sure they do. You sneak out real late at night, Don't let the horses know you're comin'... you'll hear them havin' whole conversations. They be talkin', arguin' amongst each other. It's true. I knew a horse once...ahem... used to write poetry. yeah! Couldn't spell worth a hoot. But the words, they all rhymed out Nice and even, though. Aw, dad, you're jokin' us. No, I'm not. Yeah. Hey, July... you want to try the next one? You know somethin' about this one I don't want to find out? Uh-Uh. Go. Hey. Compadre... bring cloud watcher down here. Hooah! Hooah! hooah! You ready for this? Well, I better be. Didn't come up here for a free ride. He can't to keep his head down where it belong. Good luck. He's got somethin' to prove. Especially after the way he seen you ride. Oh, boy. You gentlemen have worked hard To bring prosperity to Montana. But it seems we've brought a plague upon ourselves. It used to be a few hungry indians Running off with our stock. Now it's outlaws driving them all the way up Into the Missouri breaks, blocking out their brands And selling them for themselves in Canada. And what's even worse, homesteaders-- Which in my book stands for rustlers-- People with a dozen head one year And a hundred head the next. They're some mighty busy cows, they are. Or some mighty busy men. Now, then, I had 3 dozen head of cattle Stolen yesterday, And 2 good hands took bullets In the exchange. I'm getting heartily tired of this, gentlemen. It's time we took action. Yeah. Yeah. And... you should all have a copy of this list here. I want you all to look very carefully At every single name on it. I don't see that Hat Creek honcho on this list. Yeah. Yeah. He's not on my list. He's not on my list, either. Woodrow Call is no rustler, gentlemen. Well, he ain't here. Why ain't he on this list? Call's a Texas ranger... or he used to be. Sure, we've had our differences. But I'm confident that when the time comes, He will ride with us. It's just that he's a very... self-sufficient man. Everything's under control. What about Captain Call? You can't be serious About leaving him off that list. What's at stake here Is far more important than one man. You said that no one would be independent Of whatever actions we take. Precisely. But when these actions take place, Every independent, including Captain Call, will come under our protection, And they'll soon see that without that protection, They will not be able to survive. And when Montana becomes an independent state, Then the alliance will be able to control the price of beef, Its distribution through the new railway lines, And the people in office. Hmm? Gentlemen, to the alliance. The alliance. Aye. Women are funny creatures, Woodrow. You bring them the breadth of the country On the back of a horse, and when they get there, They expect to sleep on a mattress at night, Not a cold dirt floor. That's what you're going to town for, mattresses? I'm going to order a mattress And sundry other things people need When they establish a home. If you're buying a mattress, that's your business. It better not show up on any Hat Creek account. Don't get too close to no dress shops, neither, While you're there. Don't want to lose you. I can't leave this outfit now. Someone's got to be here What has a feeling for women. Work gloves. Yeah. Terrible thing how some people Take to liking each other. Ain't it, Woodrow? You getting at something? Nope. Woodrow. I want to set something straight. Hurry, Many Tears! I know Gus was mostly to blame For you leaving Newt. You having to haul him all the way back to Texas Is what done it. I reckon we can always find someone dead To blame things on. It was Gus made you leave when you did. If you'd have been there, Newt wouldn't have gotten into trouble. If I was here, Newt wouldn't have been put to the test. Test seems to have failed. You were fair... with Gus' girl. And it pleases me so that you were. As if Gus was... reaching back from the grave To clean up some of the mess he made. It weren't your fault alone. Gus just ain't around to blame. And in the pain of... losing him... I suppose I... held only to his finer qualities. I appreciate your hostilities is subdued. Help me get up. Hello, girls. You going into town? You going to get some candy? Don't you eat too much. You get sick and fat like me. You don't want to be fat like Cholo. You take care of my girls, now. Martin, crying: Mommy! * they swam the wide rivers and climbed the tall peaks * * and camped on the prairie for weeks upon weeks * * starvation and cholera, hard work and slaughter * * they'd reach California * * in spite hell and high water * * come a fall daisy rider * * come a fall daisy rae... * Mr. Walker, if you don't mind, I'd like to ride back And ask someone to come along to town with us. Agostina? Go right ahead, July. High time you get your nerve up. All right. Maybe old Martin here would like to change places with me. Do I get a say in the matter? What would you say? I'm afraid of men like you. Afraid? Why's that? Some men just scare a woman. That can't be a good thing. It might be. I never been sure. Maybe we should find out. It's been a long time since I knew a man who made me laugh. Go back, July! Get Woodrow! Aah! Mommy! Mama! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Mama? Sally! Stay down! Mama! Aah! Sally! No! Get behind the wagon! Aah! Mommy! Mommy! Oh... don't move. Stay still, girls. Are they done? Mommy! Mommy! They're done. We get the pickings? Be quick! Ha ha! Hey, hey! Ride. Mama. Shh! They're coming in. Clara... God, don't die. Look over there, over there yonder. Pretty. It's eatable. No more for me. Doing pretty good, Isom. Hardest part is over. Captain! Captain! Captain! They've been ambushed. Lord! They's all ambushed in the canyon. Boys, get on and mount up! Terrible attack! Mount up! Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Mommy! Martin! Mommy! Mommy! Come here, baby. Shh... mommy! Mommy! She's alive! She's alive! She's alive! We have to get her back to the house! Come! Cholo is here! Mama? She's hurt. We'll help her. Cholo is here. Captain. He was charging whoever cut him down. He got a piece of them, though. Blood trail lead this way. Pea? Captain? Tell the boys... go tend to Clara. We'll go on. We ain't gonna lose this son of a bitch. Git up. Come on. We'll finish this for you...ranger Walker. Whoa! Whoa! Easy there, boy. Don't get throwed in the puddin', now! Throw that sack over his head. All right. Who's Newt? What is it? Mr. Dunnigan wants you up to the house. I need a fresh horse. Frank, the man needs a horse. Tend to that one. What happened? Outlaws. Time's come, Newt. Do you know who done it? Same mob we think shot 2 of our own. I want this whole outfit Armed and ready for a week's ride in 30 minutes. Where are we headed? To put a stop to what's already out of hand. 30 minutes. Yes, sir. Who'd do such a thing? Can't just be rustlers or thieves. Can't. Vultures. Paint horse. There he is. This far north? That's him, captain. Son of a bitch killed my brother. He get into those hills, He can hold us off. I need me an extra horse. I only got one. Come on, let's go. Give me a stirrup, Pea. Is that him, captain, Cherokee Jack? I believe so. Giddup! There he is. Captain. He had that on him. Money. For the kids, From their uncle Isaac. No, I can't. That's blood money. End it now. When I hear what I want, we will. Pa! Pa! He's done it! He's done it! What's this? Delegations from all around the alliance. They look like an army. That's right. Billy. We got Cherokee Jack. Supposed to say a message to the women. Your mama? She's sleeping, sweetheart. Papa. Si. Papa. Who is it? It's Pea Eye. Ma'am, captain said Get the women and children to the fort. You're to go quickly. Uh...where's Isom? With the captain. He's going to help stop the Dunnigan outfit. He sent for help from them homesteaders. What about Cherokee Jackson? He's gone to hell, ma'am. Juana! Billy. Fetch my shotgun. Are you sure the governor's Going to stand behind you on this? If those are our cattle behind those fences, He will. I'm looking for Warren Raab. I'm Raab. I'm Gregor Dunnigan. I know you. I hear you been selling my cattle. Well, that's a lie. Well, in that case, You wouldn't mind us looking over your stock, Would you, mister? Stay back! Go ahead. That one's ours. That one, too. Well, that can't be. I never seen that animal before. You know the penalty for stealing cattle, don't you? But I ain't done nothing. Pa! Billy! Watch it! The boy's got a gun. No, Billy! Stop it. Stop! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. He's just a boy. That's right. Put down the gun. He's just a boy. Oh, dad. Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No... they're coming up through the pass. You boys stay here. Isom. That's a whole lot of guns. As good a place as any... to make a stand. You bet. They're a-comin'! Let's gather up. I'm riding out to 'em. If something happens to me And they keep on this way, Wait till the main body gets full over the ridge Before you throw your dynamite. Otherwise you'll just warn 'em and lose 'em. When it blows, There'll be some confusion. Snap off a few quick ones, Then ride away if you can. Them other ranchers come to you, join with them. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck to you, captain. Captain. I'll ride with you. No, Pea. You stay by these men. Yes, sir. If I get kilt, Just stuff my body any old place. That'll do. Yes, sir. It's Captain Call. Hold the column. Hold! Hold it up. Spread out. That's as far as you go, Dunnigan. How's that? A killer, name of Cherokee Jack, Said you paid him to gun down my people. That's a damn lie. Said this is what you give him to do it. I can't abide you, Dunnigan... murdering just to get more grass. It's a hell of a sorry thing. You don't know what sorry is yet, mister. I think I do. And I hold you responsible. Quite frankly, What you think doesn't matter anymore. Now, you get out of my way. I'm going to count to 3. If you don't drop that shooter in the dirt, I'll put a hole in your heart. What about all these men? Cut off the head, the rest don't rattle long. You're a fool. 1... Newt. He's lying to you, boy. The captain don't lie. You mean I do? Yes, sir. That's your money pouch. I remember. I'll kill you myself if I have to. 2... eh? I've got some information in here... captain! Drop your guns. Them are ours. They got to pay for what they done. Mr. Thompkins, if you want law and order, It's going to have to start with you. You can't possibly think that-- 1... surely you can't imagine that-- 2... if we surrender, We demand a proper trial. You'll get your trial. Tell the others it's over. "In God have I put my trust. "I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. "Be merciful unto me, o God, "Be merciful unto me, "For my soul trusteth in thee. "Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge Until these calamities be overpast." Amen. Amen. Amen. Gideon. I've talked to Cholo and the girls. We're going back to Ogalalla. Now, you are welcome to stay. I feel welcome. I do. But the little I've learned in my life Has been from hard lessons. You can't run away from the ashes. You have to... rebuild from the ashes. Will you wait for first foals? All the same to you, we want to beat the frost. I'll see to it Pea Eye and some of the boys Get you all the way safe back. Woodrow. Patron. Vaya con dios, patron. A fella have to give him that, Newt. Man gets leaned on as hard as Captain Call... needs him some time alone. I suppose. Long as I've known Woodrow Call, He's been in charge. Think about all them questions Been put to him in his lifetime. All them problems Other folks bring to him. Huh. No wonder he want to leave Texas. What happens soon as he gets up here? No problem. Who does everybody look up to? Is it people that bring in problems, Isom, Or him looking to take them on? Well, can't say that it matters much, really. Long as he handles 'em... one problem at a time. You know, I-- I need to tell you... when I was, uh... when I was riding back from the canyon. Mm-hmm. I wanted to ask you to... go to town, uh... you know, with us, and... ah, then that shooting started and-- July... us? With us? Yeah, well... with, uh...me. Yeah. With me. You went against him. I had to. Why? Did you ever know his plans, really? That alliance? Did you? I should have. I know what he told me. I just never added it up to what he did. I just could never figure that. Never. Well, he was good to me. I never tried to picture anything else. Will you be staying here? Yes. You won't take what he offered you, will you? I don't think he'd want that offer to stand The way things turned out. It stands. No. Good-bye. Go to hell, Newt Dobbs. Are you looking for somebody? Found him. Get things said? What could be. We said some hard words between us. Yes, sir. I regret that. Me, too. Some things didn't get said, too. Well, that's over now. No, it ain't. Your mother Maggie... Gus, he said I let her down. Never cared to admit that. Well, that was a long time ago, captain. Not for me. I'm so sorry to have never known her. It wasn't about you, Newt. It was me. How I felt about myself. My failings. You picked a good spot, captain. There's a bunch of work to do. Seems you might know horses Almost good as me now. Captain, I'm moving on. This is your dream. Ain't no reason it can't be your dream, too. It's the same reason you couldn't live a life You didn't decide on by yourself. I understand that now. I'd be obliged if you tell Pea Eye And the boys... thanks for all they done. Don't want a big good-bye. It's time, captain. I reckon. Newt... Dobbs--That was your mother's name. Call... that's...Scots. So they tell me. It's had no dishonor I'm aware of. You want to be leavin' all of this here... for steady work and steady wages? This civilized world of yours, captain... we ain't part of it. What about that whore of Maggie's You had that child with? What's his name? Newt, wasn't it? You sayin' Jake's my pa, captain? Well, I'd a hell of a lot rather It was Jake than you, 'Cause Jake knew people could make mistakes. Like my mama the day she made me. Barbed wire draws a nasty line, mister. That sense of honor that ties Newt to Dunnigan-- You give him that. You can't run away from the ashes. You have to... rebuild from the ashes.
