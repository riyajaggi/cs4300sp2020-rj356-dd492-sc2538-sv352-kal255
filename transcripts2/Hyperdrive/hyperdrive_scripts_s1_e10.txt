 running on five cylinders and fumes, Axel Francois. [Michael Bisping] Oh my God. No way! [in French] That's what I call a show. [Mike Hill] Night in and night out, they pushed their cars, and themselves, past their breaking points. [in French] I'd rather break something than drive carefully. [in Japanese] If I give up, it's all over. [Mike Hill] Now they have one final race to make their mark. [bang] [in Portuguese] I've dreamed of this all my life. [Corinna] I know me, I know my car, I know my skills, I can beat everyone here. [João in Portuguese] It's the final. I'll give everything to be on the podium in first place. [Mike Hill] One final race to be crowned... At this point, its checkers or wreckers. [Mike Hill] ...the Hyperdrive champion. [female announcer] Final track engaged. Prepare for launch. [Mike Hill] This is the Hyperdrive finale. One race to determine who is the ultimate champion on four wheels. Our final six drivers are back in the pits, making last-minute preparations and adjustments. Now this competition has been like nothing they could have ever imagined. But they've risen to every challenge, and tonight, they've earned a shot at the Hyperdrive title. Yeah, but this track has never been more difficult. If you want the trophy, you're going to have to conquer the Monster. Nine obstacles in their most lethal forms yet. It's a cluster of precision challenges right out of the gate, A familiar foe, the Leveler, stands guard in the middle, and there are ten targets to negotiate down the back stretch on what may be the toughest section of course we've ever seen. [Mike Hill] It all comes down to this. So buckle up! The Hyperdrive finale starts right now. [announcer] Fielding Shredder, report to the start line. [MH] Alright fellas, here it is. The best of the best, and up first is the Wild Child, who won the Wildcard. And Fielding Shredder... Alright, it's time to show up. [MH] ...said he got into this competition because he wanted to make his dad proud. His dad had a stroke eight years ago, and has been incapacitated ever since. I'm pretty sure his dad is proud of his son's efforts right now. [engine starts] [Fielding] For many years, my dad being military, he made me earn everything. He never bought me a car. He never paid any insurance. He never gave me gas money, and growing up, I hated that. But as I mature more and as I turn racing into a career, I realize that that taught me some valuable lessons. Because of the stroke, I wasn't able to show him how much I really loved and appreciated all the things that he taught us. But I think when he sees me here, he'll definitely understand that over the many, many years of busted knuckles, and sweat and tears, I made it happen. - [crowd cheers] - [engine revs] [MH] And we know that dear old dad is watching at home. His son Fielding is ready for launch. [cheering] You see his girlfriend there, Alyssa, and friend Dave, who made the trip to support him tonight. Alright, for all the marbles. [Rutledge Wood] This course is absolutely gigantic, so many places to make mistakes through these nine obstacles. He's got to put that out of mind. No more talk about dialing it back tonight. His best shot at this championship is to go out there and at every turn, every challenge, be Fielding Shredder, and he's going to do great. This is going to be fun. [MB] Take a look at the back of the car, because that thing is falling apart. [Rut] You can see the rear spoiler is hanging off. [MB] That is going to fall off on this track. I'm telling you right now. [MH] Held together by duct tape, bubble gum and dreams, representing the USA, straight out of Texas, Fielding Shredder! [tires squeal] [crowd cheers] [Mike Hill] The finale underway! Slideways is going to jump on him right here in the first turn. - [bang] - [RW] Yes! Oh God. [hosts] Whoa! [MB] Too much! [Rutledge Wood] Inches away from the K-rail. You're good. [MH] A nice recovery, but lost some time right out of the gate. It's double Supernova next. Two Rockford turns and tonight, knocking over those pylons will cost you five seconds a piece. Keep it under control, you're good. - [Rut] Yeah, Fielding! - [crowd cheers] Yeah, baby! [MB] Yeah, like a glove. [Fielding] Let's do it again. [MH] Let's do it again. Here, this is for you, Dave. [MB] Woo. [Rut] Yeah! [crowd cheers] Oh yeah. Okay, I'm drifting. I'm drifting. No drifting. Keep it together. I don't care. [MH] The Wild Child getting a little wild on his way into Pipe City, and I love it. He's got to do a 540 around this pylon coming up. That's one and a half turns. - [tires squeal] - Oh God, dang it. [MB] Ah, man! You're alright. Get around it. [Rut] A little stumble, but he's back on track. That was alright. Watch the throttle. Watch it, zero. [MB] Let's remember, this is the best of the best against the best! Seconds matter, seconds count, and seconds can lose you this tournament. Woo! Come on, baby, third gear. [Rut] So much speed between the challenges and it's that speed that can help Fielding make up for some of those early mistakes. We're at the 360, remember? Calm down. [Fielding] Oh, calm down. That's like telling your girlfriend to calm down. That's not a good idea. [Mike Hill] 2:06 into Fielding's run as he stares down Cyclone, Give me green light. [MH] We've tightened the runway with two additional rows of penalty pylons, and drivers still only have 15 seconds to bust out that 360 and exit on the other side. [tires squeal] [spotter Shellen] Let's do it. Kill it. Woo! [hosts cheer] - [Rut] Look at that! - [MH] Spinning! [MH] Didn't quite get all the way around, but he's spinning it. [Shellen] Go! [Mike Hill] Can he make it out in time? - Yes! - [Rut] Look at that! [MH] Nicely done. [MB] Wow! [MH] Fielding Shredder, he is flying around this course. [MB] Look at the speed. Hairpin right. Hairpin right. [MH] He's coming up on his nemesis, the Leveler. Fielding has never solved this. Alright, Leveler, I will conquer you. [Rut] If ever there were a time for him to figure it out, it's right here, right now. Alright, Mike. Start rolling back slowly. Just a little bit. It's barely coming down, hold on. There you go. Good job. Come back. Come on back, slowly. [MB] There's something about Fielding's story, what he's been through. The fact that he crashed. The fact that his car is literally falling apart... That thing swings. [MB] ...you can't help but root for a guy at like that. Alright, forward a little bit. Keep going. Stop there. Stop. [MB] Stay there. Hold on. You're one out of it. Very close to level. Very close. A little bit back. [MH] There you go, right there. - That's it. - Back it up a little bit. - More! - Come on, buddy. No. [MH] Here we go. Once again, this Leveler. This thing is swinging all over the freakin' place. Slightly back. [MH] Just 30 seconds left now. A little bit more. Car's getting sideways. This is tough. There you go. You got to catch it. Forward. [MH] This could be his last chance. You're in it. Wait. [Rut] Come on, baby. [Shellen] Just wait there. I think it'll come back in. [Rut] You see his girlfriend, Alyssa, can barely watch. What's my timer looking like? You're almost back in. It's green. Wait. Nope. - It's already red. It failed. Go forward. - [crowd groans] [MH] That's going to be max time at the Leveler again for Fielding, but because of the size of this course tonight, it's just a ten-second penalty. [Fielding] Come on, get me off of this thing. [Rut] Smaller penalty or not, he's left himself a lot of work to do. Four obstacles remaining, the technical Manji Alley next. [MB] This is what he specializes in, come on. - [bang] - [MH] Nicely done. - [bang] - [MB] Beautiful. [bang] [MH] Make it happen! - [bang] - [MB] That was awesome, that was perfect. Good job. Watch braking. [MH] Nicely done, and he's punching that gas over to Walk on Water. This thing almost ended his competition in his first run, - and now he must deal with these targets. - [bang] - [cheering] - MB] Nice. [Rut] Got it. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! [Shellen] Got it. [MH] And he's through clean. He'll want to pick up these next targets in one continuous drift. - [bang] - Whoa. - [bang] - [Shellen] Got two. [tires squeal] [MH] Ah! - [MB] That's a penalty. Come on, buddy. - [bang] [Rut] He hits it with the spoiler! [tires squeal] [MH] Fielding now has the option to go back through Walk on Water or ride the rail. [tires squeal] - Can't see anything. - Alright, bring it home. [MH] You know, the fastest route is go down that slide! Oh God. Here we go. [Rut] Send it. [MH] Yes! [Shellen] Good job, now bring it home. No traction whatsoever. Don't hit this wall, please. [MB] He can't see a thing right now. Let's go, baby! [MH] Look at that spoiler just hanging on by a thread. - [Shellen] Keep it together, one turn. - [Fielding] Got it. [Rut] It hasn't been the cleanest run, but he has brought the speed from start to finish. [MB] Come on. We have called him fearless. [MH] We have called him reckless. Could we be calling him Hyperdrive champion? We shall see. [crowd cheers] [MB] And the spoiler falls off right at the end. [MH] Tore the cable. - Yes! - [MB] Wow! [MH] Oh my gosh. Incredible. Look at the spoiler on the road here. [Rut] That is unbelievable. [Fielding] Woo-hoo! Yeah, baby! Woo! [Rut] When you talk about putting it all on the line, the front bumper is hanging off, the spoiler shot off, That is exactly the run that Fielding Shredder needed to do. [Fielding] Alright, I somehow survived. Hell, yeah! [MB] Did really well, went fast, but the Leveler... the Leveler defeated him once again, and as we've seen, that can be the difference. Absolutely incredible. You were about to get too wild, and then you [bleep] killed it. - Good stuff. - Oh [bleep]. [Mike Hill] After that scorcher of a lap, the pace is set at 6:28. Five more drivers will take the course in this final round. There you see our randomized race order for championship night. It's the best against the best, but there can only be one winner. [announcer] Corinna Graff, report to the start line. Track is hot. [engine starts] [talking in German] Ciao. [man on radio] Okay Corinna, you can bring it around to the start line for me. [Mike Hill] Our next racer is one badass mom, the Drift Beast from Germany, Corinna Graff. She's outlasted her husband. She's outlasted every other female driver in this competition, and now she's looking to be the last racer standing at the end of the night. [radio guy] I'll meet you at the start line. [Rut] This is huge, guys. She knows that Fielding Shredder put in a great lap. Maybe his best drive yet. She's got to be able to feel that pressure and really step up right now. [MB] She is representing the Graff family, the legendary racing family from Germany that have been at this for more than 20 years. So much of their life has gone into this, so much money, expense, sacrifice. This will mean so much to her, to come to Hyperdrive and get this done. [MH] There's her family in the gallery, including Alex, her husband, cheering her on. They believe she can win it all. [Rut] And guys, Corinna has a window of opportunity here with Fielding failing to solve the Leveler. That's been her bread and butter, something to look out for. The pressure is on for Corinna. Let's do this. [Benny in German] Okay, so here we are. Just drive coolly, smoothly. Get through without errors, and then rock the boat, okay? Yes, baby. [Benny] Take another deep breath. Okay, let's go! [Corinna] Yeah, ready to race! [engine revs] [crowd cheers] [Benny in German] Left, Slideways. [MH] Wants to get off to a good start, here at Slideways. [bang] [MH] Missed that first target. And we've seen, when drivers miss that first target, sometimes it throws them off. Let's see if she can regain that focus as she goes into Supernova. - [in German] Did I get them both? - [Benny] No. Oh, great. Doesn't matter, just drive. [thud] [announcer] Supernova engaged. [MH] Fielding Shredder killed this. [MB] Typically she does very well here. [tires squeal] [Rut] Alright, got it. [MB] True to form. [MH] Nicely done. [thud] [MH] Second time around through Supernova. That Rockford turn... getting it done. [in German] Yes! Very nice! Get out. [Rut] There you go. [MH] She's out of Supernova clean. The Drift Beast now looking to make up some time here in Pipe City. [Rut] Let's see if she can bring some speed. She's got to push it every chance she's got. [MH] She's got to do one-and-a-half turns around this pylon now, a complete 540. [Corinna, in German] No! Keep going, 540! [Rut] She did not do a 540 rotation there. [MH] Six obstacles to go. Corinna looking a little out of sorts early, [in German] That was awful. [MB] When the pressure is on, when it's the finale, when so much is riding on it, it's not only the car that is racing. Your mind is racing at 100 miles an hour. [MH] Right, Bis, and we'll see how she responds, sitting only 15 seconds now behind Fielding Shredder here at Cyclone. [MB] I can't wait to see this. - [MH] Here we go. - [Rut] Come on, Corinna. She's got to bring a little heat here. Get it, girl. [tires squeal] [hosts] Oh! [Rut] There you go. Kept it off the light. [MB] Come on. You've got this. - [crowd cheers] - [Rut] She got it! [MB] Wow! [Benny in German] Yes! In time. Now for the Leveler, your best friend. [MH] Corinna Graff is still chasing Fielding's time, but headed towards her good old friend, the Leveler. Now, she's been so dominant here throughout this competition and this is a prime opportunity she's got to make up some time right now. [Rut] If she can nail this Leveler, she will make up for so much time that she's lost on some of these targets early. Even though max time is only a ten-second penalty tonight, We've seen the Leveler decide so many races in this competition. [in German] Okay, catch your breath. We can do this. A little back. Down! Backwards! Further! Too slow. [Corinna] Are you still blabbering? I'm doing the Leveler by myself. [Benny] Got it. Let it fly! [MH] She told him just to shut up. Let her do it. Getting down to the wire here. Just 30 seconds left. You don't hear anything from Benny. [in German] I don't get it. I'm driving down, okay? [MB] What? I can't get it. [Benny] Drive down. It's all good. [MH] She's just going to give up on it. [MB] Ah! Could you imagine nailing the Leveler every time, but in the finale you just don't get it? [Benny in German] Okay, put it in gear. Take a breath. You can do this! [MH] Corinna Graff has left herself little or no margin for error, headed into Manji Alley. [Rut] Come on. [MH] Oh, misses the first target, and the second. - [bang] - [MH] Ooh. Those are going to be insurmountable penalties, and her family is looking on in disbelief. - So are we. - [MB] Come on, finish strong. [Benny] Look out, Walk on Water. There are two targets there as well. Yeah, I know. [Rut] Guys, I don't know who is behind the wheel. This does not look like the Corinna that we know. [hosts groan] [MB] Oh man! - [bang] - [MB] Ah, there we go. Whoa! [MH] Whoa, she's into the water. The train coming all the way off the tracks here. [MB] Falling apart at the seams. - [bang] - [hosts groan] [in German] What's up? - [MB] What is going on? - [engine splutters] - Oh. - The car is stalling. [engine splutters] [Corinna in German] It's spluttering. [groans] - [MH] The water. - [MB] The water has been... ah! This is disastrous. [MH groans] - [in German] It's gone? - It's not running anymore. It got water in it. [MB] Come on. I know this feeling. This is the worst. [MH] Guys, Walk on Water has been an absolute car killer. Corinna Graff has overcome so much. Is this how it ends? [sighs] [engine turns over] [Rut] Guys, the irony here is, this has been one of the strongest cars the entire tournament. [MH] Lindsay, what are you hearing there? Benny, what's going on? Do you know? She says the engine is not starting again, and I don't know why. That means we're screwed. Dammit. Those are honest words from Benny. "We're screwed, dammit." [engine turns over] [MB] Ah. [engine turns over] [engine fires up] [Corinna] My car is running again. So, okay good. [MH] Sounds like she got it back on. [applause and cheering from crowd] I will drive my car over the finish line, okay? [MH] Look at this. She ain't done yet. [MB] At this point you just try to finish the race for pride's sake. [applause and cheering] [in German] I'm sorry. It's okay. At least we will get the award for most spirit. Thank you. [MH] Corinna Graff, one of the toughest competitors we've seen, and she proved just that. A valiant effort. [MB] She's got so much to be proud of. Of course, the final woman left in the tournament, she had an injury, she went to the hospital, her car broke down in the finale. Did she give up? No, she's here, she's smiling, she's got a lot to be proud of. [crowd cheers] [Corinna] I cannot win the race for Germany, for the Graffs, for the females, but I was able to drive over the finish line. [MH] You hear the crowd, a huge cheer. [cheering] [Corinna] I will not forget the experience here. From race to race, my family helped me till the final. I didn't think that I'd come so far. I'm really proud, really. [big cheer from the crowd] [MH] Despite that inspiring effort, Corinna's failure to complete the course means she'll post a DNF. and that means Fielding Shredder is still the man to beat here on championship night. [announcer] Track is hot. Atsushi Taniguchi, report to the start line. [engine starts] - [Ken in Japanese] Good to go, Atsushi. - I'm ready. [Atsushi in Japanese] I've been in many races, and I've had some successful results, but I always made mistakes at critical moments. I tried D1 Grand Prix... Formula Drift Japan... but it kept happening. Always mistakes. Mm. Hyperdrive is my opportunity to succeed. I want to show my children... that the most important thing in life... is to follow your goal, don't give up, and achieve it. - [engine revs] - [crowd cheers] [Rut] It only takes onelap to be a champion, and this could be that lap for Atsushi. [MH] 6:28 is the mark. Fielding Shredder will be watching this one very closely. Can Atsushi take over that top spot? [in Japanese] Let's try as usual. You've done all this before. Yeah, you're right. [MH] He's been up and down all competition, Rut. So what should we expect tonight? [Rut] Listen, Atsushi has the talent to win this thing. This Toyota has been really rock solid, and he feels like everything he's done in his life with cars has built up to this moment. He can go out there, and have the run of a lifetime. [crowd cheers] [in Japanese] Everyone is so kind. [MH] The only thing that matters is this race right now. Atsushi Taniguchi. Can he get it done? [Ken in Japanese] Here we go! Go! [MH] Here we go. [in Japanese] There are two targets at the first one. [MH] The Drift Sensei. [bang] [MH] He missed the first. [MB] Missed it! [in Japanese] That's okay, cool. [Rut] Just missed that back one. - [MB] Not the best start. - [bang] [in Japanese] Try it with full energy for Supernova. Remember, shift into first gear. [Rut] Come on, Atsushi, you can do this, buddy. [hosts yell] Whoa! [Michael Bisping] Wow! [Rut] Unbelievable, carried so much speed into that turn, just barely avoids hitting that pylon. [whoops] Nice! - [bang] - [Rut] Come on buddy. One more time. Just like that. [MH] Here we go. - [Rut] Yes! - [MH] There it is. [MB] That's how you do it. [MH] Taniguchi! [in Japanese] You're good. [MH] The Drift Sensei with a nice run through double Supernova. Turn right at the next corner. [Rut] He's got the 540 coming up. Let's see if Atsushi came to play. He should ace this. [Ken] It's a 540 degree turn. [MH] Both Fielding and Corinna stumbled here. [tires squeal] [MB] There we go. [MH] Whoa! Made it look easy. [Ken in Japanese] Cool. You're good to go. [MB] Flying through there. He's using that turbo Toyota power to his advantage right there. Now he's not traveling nearly as fast as Fielding between obstacles, but he's been precise since that early mistake. [in Japanese] Stop at the signal. [MH] The Drift Sensei running 10 seconds behind our leader here at Cyclone. He's got to find a way to make up some time. [MB] Here we go. [Rut] It's a lot tighter this time, here for this 360. [hosts yell in excitement] [MB] Wow! [Rut] Look at that. [MH] Five seconds left! It's going to be a race to the exit. And he's out. [crowd cheers] [MH] Laying it all on the line as he makes his way to the Leveler. [MB] The Leveler is the big equalizer. This is the one that will determine the Hyperdrive champion, I think. [MH] And everybody remembers Atsushi went airborne here in his first race in Qualifier One. Time to see if he can conquer this six-story behemoth, and launch himself into that lead. [Ken in Japanese] Cool. Let's back up a little. [MB] Right now he's thinking about his wife, his children, and how imperative it is that he gets this correct the first time. [in Japanese] Back a bit more. Back... Stop right there. [MH] Fielding Shredder watching this one closely. [in Japanese] Can you see it coming down? Yeah, it's coming down. [MH] This is Atsushi's championship, right here. [MB] Come forward, bud. What you doing? Come on, the clock is ticking. [in Japanese] Cool. Back up. Stop. That was a little fast. Let's move forward a little bit. [Rut] Oh, guys, it was so close there. [Ken in Japanese] A little bit more. Okay, be ready to go back up. - [MH] Those precious seconds. - [MB] He is so close. [in Japanese] Stop! [MB] Come on, buddy. Hang in there! - [MB] Wow! - [MH] He did it. [in Japanese] Go! Move ahead! More! [hosts yell in excitement] - [Rut] He did It! - [crowd cheers] Atsushi! Taniguchi! [MH] Atsushi solves the Leveler with just 15 seconds to spare. [Rut] My face is melting off. I can't believe this. I'm going to have a heart attack. [in Japanese] That was close! [Rut] Atsushi has got a chance here at the championship. [Ken in Japanese] Go! [MH] Can he get it done? Fielding was perfect through Manji Ally. Will Atsushi keep pace? - [bang] - [MH] Yeah, there you go. - [bang] - [MB] Oh! - That's how you do it. - [bang] [Rut] Perfect. - [bang] - [crowd cheers] [MB] Wow! [MH] Atsushi having the drive of his life. We could be looking at our new leader. [in Japanese] Walk on Water. Wipers on. [MH] Just over a minute to make it home. [Rut] But this is it, buddy. Make or break. [hosts groan] [MH] Man! [MB] Oh my God. - [thud] - [hosts groan in disappointment] [MH] Back-to-back mistakes! Will that cost him the championship? [Rut] He has to hit these next targets to give himself a chance. [MH] Two down, two to go. - [bang] - [Rut] Come on, buddy. One more. [MH] Oh! You got it. [Ken in Japanese] Cool, let's go ahead to Rail Slide. [MH] Still got a shot if he chooses to send it down the rail. - [MB] Come on. - [Rut] This is the shorter way around. [MH] He's got to push it home, boy. [MB] Will it be enough? [hosts] Whoa! [MB] Oh, Atsushi! [MH] Alright. [MB] Drive like your life depends on it. [MB] This is so close. - [Rut] Everything you've got, man. - [MB] Come on. [MH] Atsusui Taniguchi. Can he take over first place? [Ken in Japanese] Full throttle! Let's go! - [MH] Coming down the final stretch. - [MB] Here it is. [MH] It's going to be close at the line. [MB] Let's go! Atsushi! [crowd cheers] [MB] Oh my word. [applause] [MH] Oh, heartbreaking. Just couldn't match Fielding's speed down the stretch, but what a run. And for the family man from Japan, well, those critical penalties through Walk On Water, that just proved to be the difference. [MB] Oh man. Shows you how tough this Hyperdrive course can be. Grueling on both car and driver. [clapping] [groans in exhaustion] [announcer] Five minute warning. - [Ken clapping] - [Atsushi laughs] [MH] So the Drift Sensei falls just short of his dream. But he will certainly leave a lasting impression here at Hyperdrive. Fielding Shredder remains the man to beat, but will his time of 6:28 be enough to win him the trophy? Three racers still to come. [announcer] João Barion, report to the start line. Track is hot. [engine roars to life] [Mike Hill] Here comes the Sheriff, João Barion, finishing in the top three in every one of his races so far. Definitely one of the favorites. Out of Brazil, of course, had to quit racing for 10 years for financial issues, but what a comeback story it would be, if the former racing prodigy could walk away with this Hyperdrive title. [João in Portuguese] I was one of the best drivers of my time when I had to end my career. The opportunity to drive here, it means so much to me, to show the world my skill. But it could all end in a matter of seconds. If I want my dream to continue, I have to be very precise. This is the race that decides it all. [engine revs] [crowd cheers] [engine revs] [MH] He's been locked in a battle with his friend and fellow Brazilian, Diego Higa, throughout the Knockout Rounds, and now he's competing against Higa for a Hyperdrive championship. You see, both his wife Larissa and mother Vera have made the trip from Brazil to support him, so a lot on the line for the Sheriff tonight. [Rut] Guys, he has put his pride and joy, this 65 Mustang Fastback, through its paces. This car showed up, ready to be in anybody's showroom, and it has been beat to death out here. He has to be thinking about that pressure mechanically. Can he get the car back here in one piece? [MB] You're so right. That said, he's still full of confidence, still full of beans, still feels he has what it takes to win this championship, so, you know, we'll see what happens. Does he have one good race in him that could decide a Hyperdrive championship? He said he wants people to follow their passion because you only have one life. [in Portuguese] Let's see if we can do something special here. [João] Leave it to me. [Nando] We came here to win, bro! [João] It's us, bro. Let's go! Woo! [crowd cheers] [MH] Here we go. [MB] Let's do this. [MH] Can he take over that top spot? Fielding Shredder sits atop that leaderboard. A championship is on the line. [engine roars] [Michael Bisping] Let's go! [engine roars] [MH] Here we go. Drift it! [Rut] Oh, yeah. He got it. Almost hit that K-rail. [bang] Woo. [in Portuguese] That's it, bro! Go! [MB] A huge thing that he has going for him is that no one has done a perfect run yet. - [bang] - [announcer] Supernova engaged. [in Portuguese] Stay straight, João. [MH] Let's go for a spin. Oh! Nicely done. [Rut] João Barion, off to a great start. [bang] [MH] Look at that, Rut. It looks like that car is leaking. [Rut] I don't know if he hit one of those targets too hard, and the radiator's leaking, but there's definitely something up with that car. [MH] He's through the first two obstacles clean, but sounds like he might have bigger problems. [in Portuguese] The water cooler radiator burst, bro. [João] Ah! [Nando] It's going to be fine, dude. There's nothing we can do. Just continue. [Rut] If he punched a hole in that radiator, with a car like this and that much power, he will not make it back without hurting that engine. [MH] Does it have enough to get through this course? 540 barrel roll, with ease. [in Portuguese] Go! Get out of there! Hit it! [Rut] When he's pushing hard on the throttle, it's almost like the pressure in that radiator is pushing the fluid out in front of the car. [MB] Look at this here. [in Portuguese] Bro, I can't see anything! [Rut] And guys, if you run this car out of water in that radiator, it's going to overheat, and it's going to eat that engine. [MB] Whoa. - [crowd groans] - [MH] Look at that. That ain't good, right there. [in Portuguese] Bro, the radiator punctured. Be careful and see how it goes. How's the temperature? Bro, it's 94. The temperature is fine. It's just that it's tough to see because it fogged up all the glass. Whatever, let's go. [Rut] This is a ticking time-bomb. [Nando] Hit it hard. Don't stop. [MB] It's not just about the driver, it's also about his machine, and this machine may not last. [MB] Look at that! - [João] Woo! - [MB] Flawless, absolutely flawless. You know what? I'm going for it, I'll sacrifice my car, I'm going to win this race. [in Portuguese] You did it! Get out of there! [MH] João Barion, way ahead of Fielding as he heads to the Leveler. [Rut] Where we'll see these problems mount is when he's sitting on the Leveler, the car is not moving, there's not air going over the radiator to cool the engine down. I'm afraid this thing is going to start smoking, big time. [MB] He's got to figure this out in a hurry. This is crucial. [Nando in Portuguese] Hit this lightly. The intercooler has no more water. [Rut] You see no more fluid gushing from that car. He is out of coolant, and it's a matter of when, not if he overheats that engine. [in Portuguese] It's lowering very slowly. Start going back, bro. [João] The engine is heating up. It's already at 104 degrees. [engine revs] [João] Dude, the engine is in a critical state! Now go very calmly, dude. There! Hold it there. [MH] Maybe. [MB] Here we go. [Nando in Portuguese] Hold it there! [MH] Seven, eight, nine, ten, and he got it! Yes! [crowd cheers] João Barion has figured out the Leveler. That was key. He had to. [Nando] It's on faith, man. It's us now. [João] We'll see, bro. It's hard to see. I can't see anything. [Rut] It wasn't just key, more like a miracle. That might be what saves this car. [MB] Never mind the car, that might be what wins him the tournament. [MH] Well, it's been a perfect lap so far. João Barion, crushing the competition, but can that car hold on? - [bang] - [MB] Oh! - [bang] - [Rut] Nailed it. [MH] Here we go. - [bang] - [MB] Nice. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! [MB] Yes. [MH] What a performance he is putting on. His car is failing him, but his driving skills are not. [Nando in Portuguese] If it's heating up, cool it down. [Rut] He knows he's going to put it on the line, put this car In harm's way. [MH] Got that first target, headed for the second. - [buzzer sounds] - [MH] Oh, a miss-hit there. [Rut] Oh, so far over there. [Nando in Portuguese] Get out of there, bro! [MH] Alright, okay. [Rut] Wow. Guys, that was both scary... [MB] Hold on, what's going on? [engine splutters] - [MH] Has he stalled? - [MB] Oh, no. [engine turns over] [engine roars to life] [MB] Oh, he's back! [in Portuguese] That's it, my man! Let's go! [MH] Hitting those targets right here. Thought he was done. Got three. Got to get one more. I don't know how he's doing it, but he is doing it. He's got it. All of them! Go to the rail! [Rut] At this point, send it down the rail, brother, you've got nothing to lose. Look how much water is coming out of the bottom of the car. [MB] What is going on? why it's going so slowly, Rut? [Rut] Something's going on with the car, guys. [MH] Oh my gosh, that is... Oh my God. [in Portuguese] Is it the temperature? What happened? No, it turned off. [MB] Oh. Oh my God. - Oh my God, did it? - [Rut] The car has stalled. [MH] No! - [MH] Oh, my God! - [MB] Oh my word! [Nando in Portuguese] Try again. Turn off the secondary with your foot underneath. [engine turns over] [MB] Slaying the course, winning the tournament, having that perfect lap. - Argh! - [engine turns over] [Nando] Damn, bro! You didn't turn off a switch on the console,the pumps, anything? No, it's all turned on. It's on fire here, the console. Try once more. Let's see. [engine turns over] [MB] He was on track to be winning this tournament, and then the car breaks down on the last obstacle. - [in Portuguese] No, bro. - It's over, bro. Over. [MB] Just heartbreaking. [Nando in Portuguese] We played our part, right? It was cool here. I think we did the possible and the impossible to get here. That's it, little bro. Thanks for everything. We did a lot of work to make these things happen. Damn! Thanks, little bro. We're together. Thank you for everything, big Nando. [Nando] I'm with you, bro. [João] We're together, bro. Thanks for everything, really. We still have other opportunities in our lives. [Rut] You know, he was pushing so hard, knowing that coolant was spraying out of the car onto the windshield, blurring his vision. He never checked up. He went as hard as he could. These drivers are pushing every single lap for the chance at this championship. They are willing to lay it all on the line. [MH] Yeah, the raw emotions are real, the tears are real. He came so far, but in the end, the Sheriff just couldn't finish. [announcer] Axel Francois, report to the start line. Track is hot. [Lise] Ready, Axel? [in French] Picture the track in your head. Focus on what's coming. [MH] Okay, Axel Francois has just seen two drivers not able to finish on this course. So what do you think's going through his mind right now, when his car's been giving him trouble for the longest time, and smoking every single race? [Rut] Yeah, you would have never guessed that this car could perform to the level that it has with the engine trouble he's having. I mean, he shouldn't even be here, and yet he's put down some of the fastest laps we've seen from anyone. [MH] This is a guy who has just refused to lose, and of course, he's got one of the best spotters in the game in his fianceé Lise. There's no way he makes it this far without her steady guidance every step of the way. [Lise in French] If you're calm, that's all that matters. [Axel in French] This is my tenth race, plus two head-to-heads. It's taken a lot of energy from both me and my car. There's a chance I won't finish tonight. The engine might break, but you can't win if you don't take risks. [howls] [MH] Only two racers left to run, and Fielding Shredder is still holding on to the top spot. Will he survive another challenge? [Axel howls] [MH] Axel Francois from France. Rock and roll. One good race away from being the first Hyperdrive champion. We know he can get it done. Can his car get it done? Here we go! [Lise in French] Left 90, then double targets. [Rut] Look at that speed. [tires squeal] [bangs] [bang] [in French] Perfect! J-turn, times two! [MB] This is why we love this guy. Even though the car is falling apart, he pushes it to the limit. [Lise in French] Reverse, straight. [MH] Here we go. [MH] Spin it, baby. - [buzzer sounds] - [MH] Oh! [crowd groans] [MB] Not good. [MH] Three pylons. Those are 5 seconds a piece tonight. [in French] Okay, again. [MH] He's got to back up and do it again, though. Lise doing a good job of keeping him calm here. Let's see if he can clean it up. - Oh yeah, baby. - [Rut] Yeah, buddy. [in French] Okay, perfect. Go! Go! [MH] The time to beat right now, 6:28.5. [Rut] And look how fast he gets between these challenges. [in French] Do a complete turn, 540 around the tube. [MH] He is flying. He is putting that car on the line. Only one more good drive in it. That's all it takes. [in French] Perfect, exit through the tunnel. [MH] Axel Francois, refusing to surrender. Three obstacles down, six more to go. [Lise in French] Easy. Left 90 and stop at the light tubes. You're doing great, Axel. [MH] Look at him. Just digging for every inch, every second. [Rut] He's just pushing this car to the absolute limit, and its taking it. [MB] This crazy man. [MH] But those penalties at Supernova have cost him. He's now nine seconds off of Fielding's pace. Here he goes. Punch it, baby! [engine roars] [crowd cheers] [Lise in French] That's good, my love. Bravo. [Rut] To see a rotation like that, he is putting on a clinic right now. He is. Atsushi calls him the French Drift Sensei. [in French] 100 meters, hairpin right toward the Leveler. [MH] Making his way to the Leveler. Axel still nipping at Fielding's heels, but he's got a chance to take the lead on him here if he can manage to balance it out. [Rut] And guys, he's only ever solved this once. This is huge. [in French] It's starting to go down. At your tail. [MH] Oh my goodness. - [Rut] Oh my God! - [MH] Okay. [MB] Come forward, quick! [buzzer sounds] [MB] Ah, man. He almost nailed it on the first attempt. [Lise in French] Stop. You need to go forward, Axel. Back up. More. Stop. [MH] Get back, he'll be alright. Stay there. [Lise in French] Okay, wait... Go up. Back up a little. [MB] Back it up. Yeah, baby. - [MH] Okay, alright. - [Rut] Here we go. - [MB] That is level. - [MH] Eight... nine, ten... [in French] You made it! It's good! [crowd cheers] [MH] Yeah! [crowd cheers] [Rut] He is doing so well at this point, guys, if he can keep this car together, he may have just won himself first place. [Lise] Good, let's go. [MH] Can the car hold up? Right now, he's built up a healthy lead on Fielding Shredder. Going down Manji Alley. [tires squeal] [bang] [Lise in French] It's good. [bang] - [MH] Got that one. - [bang] Got that one. You know how to drift. He so crushes Manji Alley, but it's Walk on Water next, and this has been his nemesis from the start. [tires squeal] Can't make any mistakes right here. [Lise in French] Don't forget, you've two targets. - [Rut] Be careful. - [bang] [MB] Perfect. [Lise] Okay, you got it. - [MH] He's good. - [bang] [Lise] You got it too. [MH] Staying on the course. Go! Four targets. [MB] Oh my word. [MH] Perfectly done. - [bang] - [Rut] If he can ace these targets, he's going to be the man to beat for the title. [bang] [MH] Look at that! Drifting like he's moonwalking sideways. [MB] Perfect. [MH] Look at this guy. [in French] Now turn round the light tube, then go to the rail. To the rail, Axel. [MH] Axel Francois just a rail slide away from knocking off Fielding. [Rut] Whoa! [hosts] Oh! [Rut] Oh my goodness! [MH] The Frenchman is off the rail and has built an impressive lead. [Lise in French] Hairpin right. [Rut] Going so hard, he was sideways heading toward the Rail Slide, and so lucky he did not flip that thing. [Lise] 50 meters. [Rut] Smoking like George Burns as he's coming around the last turn. [Lise] Okay, to the max. Flat out! [MH] He's going to take over first place. The only question is, by how much? [Lise] Flat out! - [MB] Unbelievable! - [MH] Axel Francois. [crowd cheers] [MH] Axel Francois, saving his best for last. Just took over the top spot by 30 seconds. A couple of penalties at Supernova, but he finally solved that Leveler. Got through Walk on Water and sent it down the Rail Slide with ease. And oh my gosh, guys, that was nearly a perfect run. Woo! Yee-ha! [Lise in French] This engine is unbreakable! [Rut] Unbelievable. [MB] Ah! The weakest car left in the championship just put on an unbelievable show. [MH] Not just the car, the driver put on an unbelievable show. [MB] The driver put on a show, that's for sure. [MH] Why not? One person who isn't celebrating right now is... fearless Fielding Shredder. [Axel whoops] [talking in French] [MB] It's on fire! [crew] Axel, fire! [MB] Look at this. Oh my God! I said before the race, the engine will be on fire. [MH] It's a barbecue grill now. [Rut] Look at the turbo glowing. - [MB] Wow. - [MH] Oh my gosh. [MB] Red hot, baby. [Rut] Look at Alexandre there with him. [MH] That could be the car that wins Hyperdrive. [MH] So Axel Francois knocks Fielding Shredder from the top of the leaderboard, and now he stands alone, the current king of the hill. But there's one driver left to race. [announcer] Diego Higa, report to the start line. [Neto in Portuguese] Diego, can you hear me? Concentrate. Good luck, son. [MH] Alright, guys, the final driver is the Baby-faced Assassin, the Prince of Drift, Brazil's last hope, Diego Higa. Hard to believe he's just 21 years old. Ahead of the competition, two-time Brazilian Drift Champion. He wants to win Hyperdrive to put his name amongst the best drivers in the world. [Diego in Portuguese] I'm in the final. Everything I've been through, all the races that I've won gave me the experience to know that I can win today. I'm prepared. I can't wait to get in the car and go. Let's give it everything. [Diego] Just one more. Just one more victory and I can leave happy. [engine revs] [Neto in Portuguese] Stay calm, please. [MH] This is a young man who has finished in first place in every race but one, and as the last driver here tonight, he knows exactly what he needs to do. [Neto in Portuguese] Everything will go right. Yes. [Rut] You know Diego is feeling the pressure right now. His girlfriend and his younger brother are in the gallery tonight. Expectations couldn't be higher. His father, Neto, a former racer, has been preparing him for this moment his entire life. [MH] Can he fulfill his destiny with one last dominant performance? The man to beat is Axel Francois, the Frenchman with a time of 5:56.1. [crowd cheers] [Neto] Prepare yourself. Let's go, it's ours, son. [MH] Will the odds on favorite write the final chapter in this story-book run? [engine roars] [MH] That first target, always critical. [bang] [MH] Whoa. Bam. [Rut] Perfect. [MB] Well, not quite perfect. Nearly went into the wall, if I'm honest. [MH] No penalties though, and he's got those Rockford turns next. [announcer] Supernova engaged. [MH] See how he does on the Supernova. [Neto in Portuguese] Concentrate. - [buzzer sounds] - [hosts groan] [MH] You have got to be kidding me! [bleep] [MH] 25 seconds in penalties, right out of the gate. [in Portuguese] Come on. Let's go. I messed up car's alignment again with that little crash. [MB] He hasn't messed up at Supernova one time, but when the pressure is on, that's when you make mistakes. - [bleeps] - [crowd groans] [MB] Oh my word, and again. [Rut] This is unbelievable. He hit two more pylons on the way out! [Neto in Portuguese] Let's go. What should you do? Put your nerves aside. [MH] A disastrous start for the Brazilian. [Rut] Hard to believe we're watching Diego having any trouble at all. It seemed like this championship was just his for the taking, but it shows that no matter who you are, you can feel the pressure. [hosts groan] Let's go! Nice. Well done. [Rut] He's got to be calm and do what he does best. [MH] He's now got 35 seconds of penalties hanging over his head, because of all the poles he knocked down at Supernova. Step on the gas. Let's go. [MH] Of course Axel took 15 seconds of penalties at Supernova, so Diego, well, he's still in this. [MB] Right now you must take some deep breaths, say, "Listen, I'm here for a reason. I've beaten these people before. Calm down." Concentrate now. I don't know who's heart is beating faster, mine or Diego's father's. I mean, talk about a pressure cooker. [MB] His father said, "Listen, I'm proud of you, son, I love you, but win or lose, we did this together." [engine revs] [engine roars] [hosts chatter in excitement] - [MB] He didn't stop for a second. Wow. - [MH] Nicely done. [Rut]That 360 was so big. For Diego to nail that, it makes him get that confidence back, and say, "No, I'm here for a reason. I got this." [MH] Making his way to the Leveler. [MB] Pretty much, this race depends on the Leveler right now. [Rut] Axel solved this with 37 seconds to spare. If Diego can't at least match him here, he can kiss the championship goodbye. [in Portuguese] One, two, start coming back. Start coming back. Stop. Come back. Backwards. It stopped. No, you went too far. Go forward. [MH] Here is the championship for him. [Rut] Precious seconds. [in Portuguese] It stopped! Stop there! Stop. [MB] That's good. [Neto] Stay still. Static. Go a little backwards. Just a bit. There. [MH] He may do it. [Neto] A bit forward... it stopped. [MH] Seven, eight, nine, ten! He did it! Woo. We killed it, dude! Let's go! - [crowd cheers] - [MB] Wow. [MH] It is going to be close. Diego Higa, can he do it? [Neto in Portuguese] Let's go! [MH] Diego's given himself a chance by solving the Leveler, and now he's headed to Manji Alley. He just can't make any mistakes. - [bang] - [Rut] Oh, he just barely clipped it. [Neto in Portuguese] Beautiful. One more... - [two bangs] - [crowd cheers] Well done, big guy! Well done, let's go. [Rut] Looking good going through Manji Alley. Now he's got to scrub that speed for Walk on Water, and he's got to be careful with his car. [Neto] Be careful with the water now. The targets there. [MB] He'll get these. - [bang] - [MH] Got that first one. [hosts] Whoa! [buzzer sounds] [crowd groans] [MH] But Diego misses the second target, and that's going to be a ten-second penalty. [MB] No way! Did I hit it, or not? [Neto] Not the second one. [MB] This is disatrous. [Diego in Portuguese] Jeez, this is horrible. My God. [Neto] Calm down. [MH] Now he has got to hit these targets to give himself a chance. - [bang] - [MB] Come on! - [bang] - [MH] Bam! [MB] There's two. [MH] Come on now. [MB] Come on, you've got this. - [bang] - [MH] Yes! [Neto] You need to come back through the water. - Seriously? - [Neto] Seriously. You can hit the target on the way back. [Diego] You sure? [Neto] Positive. [Rut] And look at this. He is going back throughWalk on Water. This is an all or nothing play. If he misses this target, it is over. [bang] [bang] [Rut] Yes! [MB] Wow! [crowd cheers] [Rut] Yeah! [MH] Diego reverses that ten-second penalty, but he's still got to take the long way home. 5:56 is the time to beat. It all comes down to this. [engine roars] [MB] Wow! [MH] The 21-year-old Brazilian drifter, the Baby-faced Assassin, coming around the last turn. [MB] Oh my word. [MH] Come on, Diego! [MB] This is so close! [MH] The youngest driver in the competition, and... yes! [MB] He has done it! [crowd cheers] [MB] Wow! [MH] He will be the driver to lead them all. What a run. What a finish. [in Portuguese] First place, bro! [MH] What a wild ride. [Neto in Portuguese] There we go, dude! Woo! [MH] 28 racers from around the globe. The prodigy. The prince Diego Higa is now a king, standing head and shoulders above them all. [laughing] [Neto in Portuguese] Well done, son. [MH] He did it! The Hyperdrive champion. [crowd cheering] [Rut] Diego, we want to present to you, the Hyperdrive trophy. Congratulations, buddy. Thank you. - [hails Brazil in Portuguese] - [crowd cheer] [Diego in Portuguese] Gosh, arriving at this result after my lap, I thought I had lost. It's marvelous. Sensational. If it weren't for my dad, none of this would be happening. I wanted to give him this trophy. He was the reason I won this race. It's perfect. It's like... everything I always dreamed of for my child... It ended up happening. So that's it. [laughs] [crowd cheering] [Axel in French] Listen, Diego beat me. He was faster and I was very happy for him. I'm happy to have made it to second place. It's pretty incredible. I hope that tomorrow I'm not going to wake up and realize that all of this was a dream. I hope it's real, because... it's been such an amazing experience. [crowd cheering] [Lindsay] Thank you to every one of our absolutely incredible drivers. You guys put it all on the line. We were blown away. You amazed the world with your talent. And we have just seen some of the greatest drivers in the world. Thank you out there for joining us on this incredible journey. From Lindsay, Michael and Rutledge. I'm Mike Hill, we'll see you next time on Hyperdrive. [crowd cheering]
