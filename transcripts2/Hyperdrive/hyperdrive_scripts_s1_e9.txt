 [Diego in Portuguese] This competition is insane. People ask me if I'm scared... Yes. [João in Portuguese] After my career ended at a young age, I learned what it's like to fall short of a dream, to spend years with pain in your heart. It was the hardest part of my life. Life is too short for us not to seize our moments. I have to reach the final. I didn't come here to play, I came to compete,

 and bring the title back to Brazil. [Mike Hill] For all of our remaining drivers, the path to get here has been a brutal one. But tonight they will pull to the start line, just one race away from a spot in the Hyperdrive finals. Not even in their wildest dreams could they imagine the course that's ahead of them now. We've got seven major challenges, and while many look familiar, don't be fooled. If you thought Walk on Water was tough before, drivers will now have to hit two targets on their way through that hidden path. [two bangs] We've completely flipped the script at the Leveler, with a dizzying new approach angle,

 and in our newest challenge, Cyclone, racers will have to execute a high-speed 360 in open space. This one is straight out of an action movie. Seven drivers remain, but only six will survive. What's at stake? A chance to win the Hyperdrive championship, That's it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so they'd better make the most of it. [female announcer] Driver one, prepare for launch. Track is hot. Driver one, prepare. [engine revs] [Mike Hill] Alright, first up it's the Sheriff, João Barion from Brazil. Of course, one of the favorites to win the title, but Rut, he had a scary moment in his last race. [Rut] He got real lucky. When he had a part failure, it actually happened after he completed the lap. When he was turning into the pits, he broke a lower control arm. His team has completely rebuilt that suspension, but I guarantee they're going to be holding their breath for this race. [engine revs] [in Portuguese] All good big bro! Let's go, eh, dude? Let's go! [engine revs] [Michael Bisping] Here we go. It's all on the line here. [MH] The Sheriff, looking to write another chapter in his storybook comeback. Can he punch his ticket to the finals? Let's go! [Michael Bisping] Wow! [MH] His first big test, coming up at Slideways. João's got to throw that huge Mustang sideways into two targets. - So tough. - [MB] Here we go. [targets clunk] [tires squeal] - [bump] - [hosts] Oh! [MH] Hits both targets, but overcooks his exit. Definitely lost a little time there. [MB] At this stage in the competition, you can't afford to make any mistakes. [in Portuguese] Go! Pedal to the metal! [Rut] This course is going to put so much stress on that rebuilt suspension, and now there's an even tougher test coming up at Cyclone. [Nando in Portuguese] Hold it now, bro. Hold it. [MH] Drivers will have 15 seconds to bust out a 360 spin, and exit a randomly assigned gate on the other side. [MB] I've never seen this done. [MH] Watch this. Oh my goodness. Here he goes. Push it. [Rut] Look at that speed. [MB] Here we go. [tires squeal] [MB] Oh! [MH] Still got to get through the gate before the clock runs out. Yes! [crowd cheers] [in Portuguese] Beautiful! [MB] That was amazing. [Rut] If that Mustang can survive that spin, João's got to feel good about that rebuilt suspension. That was nuts. [MH] Alright, but hold your breath, guys, because he now goes right to Forced Perspective, and we have shrunk the space to just one inch on either side of the car. [hosts cheer] - [MH] Yeah! - [MB] Wow! [engine roars] Woo! [MB] That's just how good this guy is. That's incredible. [in Portuguese] Nice, bro. Go! Woo! [Rut] João looks to have the car humming now, but the course only gets tougher from here. He's coming up on the Leveler next. We've moved the approach to the other side, which is going to totally change the feel for these drivers, as they try and find that balance point. [MH] That's right, Rut, and we also know this is an obstacle that can completely change your run for better or worse, and the stakes here have never been higher. [in Portuguese] Start going back, bro. [MH] He figured it out on the last course. [Nando, in Portuguese] Go back. - [Rut] Oh, guys. - [MH] Maybe. - [buzzer goes] - [hosts] Oh! [in Portuguese] Forward a bit. [MB] Go forward a little bit. [in Portuguese] Go back a little. [in Portuguese] Leave it to me, bro! Maybe... Nine, ten. [MH] Oh, he just dominated the Leveler! [cheering] - [in Portuguese] It's us, bro! - Let's go, bro! [Rut] The Sheriff, laying it down. You guys, that is the fastest we have seen the Leveler be done. [engine revs] [MH] Three more obstacles standing between João and a shot at the finals. It's the Gauntlet next. This time round, drivers have to hit the first and third targets with the back half of their car, dodge the middle one, and as always, stay on that narrow path or they gotta take max time. [Rut] Of all the obstacles we've seen, this might be the most technically difficult to accomplish at speed. [MB] Let's go, Sheriff! - [bang] - [MH] Got it! [MH] Oh, but he's off the course! No! What a disaster. That's a max time penalty of 60 seconds. [MB] Oh, come on, bro! [in Portuguese] Get out! [MB] Get the job done. He just put a ton of pressure on himself to ace Target Zone. [Rut] He's got four targets to hit, two on the inner ring, two on the outer ring, and because they're offset, getting them all in one continuous drift will not be easy. [in Portuguese] Accelerate! Go for it! - [bang] - [MB] That's it. [MH] He missed one. [Rut] Missed another target. [MB] Nail it this time. - [bang] - [MH] Got it. [MB] Nice adjustment. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! [MB] Come on, buddy. - [bang] - [MH] And bam! Nice! [Rut] Now he's got to cross Walk on Water, and there's targets on there. [MH] Yes, and he's got to drift. [in Portuguese] Let's water the horses now. [MB] Come on. [bang] - [Rut] Got that one. - [MB] Perfect. - [MH] And through the group there. - [bang] - [crowd cheers] - [MH] Alright, splendid. [Rut] Unbelievable. I don't know how he did that. The way the water slows a car down sideways like that, and him still able to hit that target. That is ridiculously hard. [MH] Still a really good time. [Nando in Portuguese] Go, man. Go! [MH] Here he comes. João Barion from Brazil. Three five seven, the Sheriff, still with plenty of bullets left. [crowd cheers] Woo! [cheering, clapping] [Rut] Guys, that was a heck of a run, but that penalty at Gauntlet hurts. We'll have to wait and see if it was enough to get him into the finals. [MH] Right now, I'd take this time if I'm any driver. Oh, 100% well done. [in Portuguese] My time may not hold up in first. So now we'll wait and pray that I was fast enough to go to the final and compete for the title. Woo! [MH] So João's work is done, at least for the moment, because tonight it will be the top five drivers moving on to the championship, while the bottom two will have to fight it out in our final head-to-head race of the season. The winner of that race will claim the last spot in the finale. The loser is going home. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver two, report to the start line. [spotter Shellen] Dude, you got this. Just remember to balance that Leveler. Everything else... You already know the course. You already know how to do all the targets. Just don't hang yourself. - Hell, yeah. - Kill it. - Alright. - Keep it together. [engine starts] [engine purrs] [MH] If there's been a driver that has lived up to his name, it's got to be this guy, Fielding Shredder, because he lives and dies by that checkers-or-wreckers mentality, and although it's been a ton of fun to watch, when you look at where he's placed so far, it has not been the most effective strategy. And on top of that, his car looks like it's been put through a shredder. [crowd cheers] [Fielding] Yeah! Let's do this, baby. Just keep it tidy. Don't do anything insane. [Fielding] No, I won't. [Rut] As long as this guy has a working engine, he's a threat to dominate, and if I'm handicapping the field tonight, I expect him to move on. The course layout suits his style. His key obstacles will be the Leveler and those dangerous targets in Walk on Water. Alright, Fielding, you got this. Keep calm. Woo! Okay. [Fielding] Putting on a great show, and being a showman with a lot of players, is only going to get you so far. The margin for error now is very slim, so I got to show up, and got to put down a clean lap. That's what it's going to take to win something like this. [engine revs] [MH] Fielding Shredder, the Wild Child, in his Nissan 240SX, with his eyes on the championship round. Here we go. [MH] Here we go. [engine roars] The US's last hope. Fielding Shredder, chasing João Barion's time of 5:53. Coming up on Slideways, and remember, João had some trouble here. Here he goes. [tires squeal] [MB] Whoa! - [cheering] - [Rut] Nails it! [cheering] [MH] That is a great start to Fielding's run. Beautiful, good job. Woo! [MH] And he's through the first obstacle, clean. Now, Fielding's had a lot of trouble racking up penalties throughout the knockout rounds, but he's one-for-one so far, and now it's time for that Cyclone 360, with only 15 seconds to get out on the other side. Y'all ready for the sickest 360? Yeah, I'm ready. You got it. [Rut] Guys, he is feeling it right now. You've got to love this guy. With everything that's on the line tonight, he's still eager to get out here and put on a show. Let's see him whip it around. I've wanted to do this ever since I got here. [hosts yell in excitement] [MH] Yeah, buddy. [Fielding] Car died. - [crowd groans] - [engine starts] [MH] Can he make the exit in time? - [buzzer goes] - [crowd groans] You're good, keep going. [MH] That's going to be a 15-second penalty, as he makes his way now toward Forced Perspective. He's never made it through here without clipping that break wall. [announcer] ...200, 100... - [bang] - [MB] Ah! No! [Rut] He caught the passenger side there a bit. - [MB] Man! - [crowd groans] [Rut] That's another five seconds added to his time. He's now taken penalties at the last two obstacles. [MB] You can see the frustration on his face. This run is not going according to plan, and he has to do everything he can to refocus. The Leveler is the make-or-break situation on this track. [MH] That's so right, Bis, and of course, Fielding has had tons of trouble here in his previous runs. Almost a full 20 seconds behind João to this point on the course. It's coming down. Start rolling back just a bit. [MH] For Fielding, this could be the difference between making it to the finals or falling short. Keep going back. Go back to the middle. [MB] He's just got to take it easy. The Leveler is in motion now. [Rut] Small movements here. Oh. Hold on, not too much. [Shellen] Stop. - [buzzer sounds] - [MB sighs] [Shellen] More forward, smaller moves. [MH] Remember, João made this look easy. Fielding's still looking lost. Wait there, just wait. [Rut] When you flip a challenge like this, everything he was looking at before was on one side of car and now he's ona totally different side of it. This thing sucks now. [MH] Just 30 seconds left. [Shellen] It's going to come back. Pull forward a bit and stop for a sec. Stop and wait there. Wait. [MH] You can hear the desperation. [Shellen] Go a little more forward. Stop there. Stop. Come on. [Shellen] Hold on, wait. [MH] And it looks like Fielding will take max time. Outdone by the Leveler again. This is killing his run. [Shellen] Slightly forward, barely. [crowd groans] [Rut] Max time. [MB] That's so frustrating. Could you imagine being Fielding Shredder, being such an amazing driver, and you fall out of the competition because of this bloody Leveler? [Fielding] Stupid Leveler. I don't like you. Yeah, it just pivots way too easily in the middle now. [MB] He's got to make sure now that he finishes the course perfectly. [Shellen] Go, baby. Go! [Rut] He's got no choice but to push it now. [Shellen] Watch it right there. - [MB] Look at this. Wow! Beautiful. - [Rut] Oh yeah, buddy. Where do I go now, Gauntlet? Gauntlet. [MH] He's taken penalties at the last three obstacles, and it only gets tougher from here. [tires squeal] [MB] Come on, hit those targets, buddy. [MH] Hit these targets. Can't afford too many more penalties. That's one. [MB] Ah, missed it. [Rut] Another 10 seconds of penalties. Fielding's staring straight down the barrel of the head-to-head if he doesn't get it together in Target Zone. [hosts] Whoa! [MH] He overcooks the turn. The mistakes are piling up for Fielding. [Rut] Here we go on the doughnut. - [bang] - [MB] Got one. [Rut] Oh, and he missed it. [MB] Ah! [Shellen] You're still good. - [bang] - [Rut] Got it. [MB] Keep it going. - [bang] - [MB] You got this. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! Nice! Walk on Water. Am I clear? [Shellen] Down to Walk on Water. [MH] Two more targets left. He cannot afford any more penalties. - [MB] Whoa, there you go. - [Rut] Look at that. - [MH] That one. - [bang] [MH] Here we go. Alright, Fielding. [MB] Look at that. [Shellen] Bring it home. [Fielding] I got that one right, baby. [hosts] Whoa! [Rut] Almost puts it into the wall there. Oh, it's coming loose. That means my brakes don't work. [Rut] He's way behind João, but every second counts. There we go. [Rut] Come on, Fielding. Hook up for me, baby. Come on. [MH] Here he comes. Fourth gear? I think so! Woo! [hosts] Whoa! [MB] Wow! [crowd cheers] [MH] Fielding Shredder's run has him sitting more than a minute off pace. We saw some moments of brilliance, but that also came with a lot of mental mistakes. The question is, will it be enough to send him to the finals? It was a good effort. Of course, the Leveler didn't go his way, but there's not too much he can do about that now. - [Shellen] That dang Leveler, man. - I need a drink. [both laugh] [MH] Broken by the six-story monster for the third time in a row, Fielding could only wait and hope his time would hold up. His fate would rest in the hands of the night's remaining drivers. First up was the Old Lion, Alex Graff. [Jacqueline in German] Just normal, drive as always. You've got this. [MH] The German drifter launched off the line, knowing he was only one step away from the championship race. [Rut] Yeah. [hosts] Woo! [MH] But he looked out of sorts early on the course. [MB] He missed the target. - [in German] You missed one. - Ah? [Rut] Going the wrong way. [hosts] Whoa! [in German] It's the other side! [Rut] He tried to go up the old way for the Leveler, but since it's reversed this time, that used to be the exit. [MH] Alex arrived at the Leveler with his Hyperdrive dreams hanging in the balance. [Rut] You know who's really hoping he has a lot of trouble getting this leveled out? Fielding Shredder. [MH] He absolutely hates this challenge... [MB] Ah! What are you doing? [MH] And as his time on the Leveler quickly slipped away... [in German] The bloody Leveler. It's such a pain in the butt. [MH] ...so did his chances of leapfrogging Fielding. [MB] This will not do. [MH] This may hurt him dearly. [MB] Let's go. [MH] The targets eluded Alex on the back half of the course... [in German] Keep driving! [MH] He's going to be really close to Fielding's time. ...and he came across the line more than 11 seconds behind the Texas drifter. The oldest driver is now on the endangered species list. [Jacqueline in German] Good job, Dad. [Rut] But guys, with that, take note. The Sheriff is officially the first driver to earn a spot in the finals. [MH] Axel Francois rolled to the start line, knowing that 7:01 was the time to beat to guarantee his place in the final race. [in French] Stay focused, Axel. [Rut] The piston rings on this car are shot. I mean, look at the amount of smoke. [MH] But the question was, How much more could his car give? [MB] Woo! Look at that smoke. The Frenchman launched, leaving a trail of smoke in his wake. [Rut] Woo! - [bang] - [MB] Oh, he missed it! [MH] But like Alex Graff, he put himself behind the 8 ball right from the start. [Rut] Clipped the driver's side. [in French] Ugh, your mother. [MH] Penalties adding up right now for Axel Francois. [in French] Okay, reverse. [MB] He's got to be patient now. [Mike Hill] Eight, nine... [Rut] Oh my God. So close. [in French] It's good. Move on. It pisses me off. [MH] His failure at the Leveler left Axel with no option but perfection on the back half of his run. [Rut] Let's see if he can make up some time here on the Gauntlet. [MB] Come on! You can do this this. [MH] And as he'd done so many times before, Axel stepped up to the challenge. - [MB] Nice. - [MH] Time to bring it home. [Rut] Look at that. [MH] Here he comes, Axel Francois at the finish line. [MB] Come on, buddy. Let's go. [Rut] He's done it. Axel Francois punches his ticket to the finals. Wow! [crowd cheers] [in French] The engine lasted. It's amazing! [MH] And so Fielding remained in the hot seat, as Atsushi Taniguchi pulled to the line. [Ken in Japanese] Here we go. Let's roll up our sleeves! Let's do that, man! [MH] The Drift Sensei had never finished in the bottom two, and hoped to keep that streak alive. [Rut] He's going to push this thing to its absolute limits. [hosts] Whoa! [MH] Facing the mounting pressure of claiming his spot in the final race... - [bang] - [Rut] Yes! [MH] ...Atsushi showed off his power... - [MB] Wow! - [Rut] Yes! [in Japanese] Wow! [MH] ...along with his finesse. [yells in excitement] [in Japanese] Wow! It seems you made it! Perfect! [MH] When he reached the Leveler, Atsushi knew that a quick solve would all but guarantee his place in the championship round. [in Japanese] Back up... stop! Move forward! Three meters ahead! - [MH] I think he went a little too far. - [Rut] Ever so slightly. [in Japanese] Let's back up. [MB] So close. Stop! - [MH] There it is. - [MB] One, two, three... [MH] Got to go back a bit. [hosts] Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! [Rut] Yeah, baby! [MH] Acing the first four obstacles put Atsushi way ahead of Fielding's pace... [Rut] Oh my gosh, this is so huge. [MH] ...and when he came down the back stretch, his sirens rang triumphant... [hosts] Atsushi! [MH] ...and his berth in the finals was secure. Atsushi, go ahead. So João Barion, Atsushi Taniguchi, and Axel Francois are all moving on to that championship race. It's currently Fielding Shredder and Alex Graff who sit in the danger zone, with two drivers still to run. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver six, report to the start line. [Neto in Portuguese] Are you hearing me, Diego? I am. Good luck, son. [MH] You know who this is. The man who really needs no introduction, the Brazilian Baby-faced Assassin. He's making some noise here on this track on Hyperdrive. Finished in first place in his last two runs, and looked dominant while doing so. [Neto in Portuguese] Alright, let's go. Let's give it our best. [MH] His frenemy, so to speak, João Barion, setting the pace so far. Diego will be chasing his time of 5:53, and of course, he's here with his father, Neto. Let's send it down to Lindsay. Thanks, Mike. Neto, his father and spotter, they're saying they didn't have to make any adjustments on this race car. But Neto, I know Diego wants to make a name for himself outside of Brazil, so does João. What are you guys going to have to do to beat him, Neto? [Neto in Portuguese] Just stay calm. Stay calm and don't make mistakes... that's it. [MH] Check that out. Diego looking cool, calm and collected in that Mustang. [Rut] It's so good to see that smile behind the wheel. A lot of people were critical at first that... he almost didn't look like he was enjoying what he was doing, it was so mechanical, but we're starting to see that personality come out. [MB] But don't let that smile fool you. This guy's a killer. This is a chance for him to come out and show everyone here, "Hey, I'm the best. Don't even bother showing up." [engine revs] [crowd cheers] [Mike Hill] Let's go! [MB laughs] [MH] Diego Higa's looking to finish atop the leaderboard for the third straight race, and he starts right here, with the two targets at Slideways. - [bang] - [MH] Both targets. [MB] He absolutely shattered them. [in Portuguese] Nice! Sensational! Awesome. [MH] Diego Higa, doing what he does on the Hyperdrive course. [MB] Going back to what you said about the smile on his face now, Success breeds success. And when he's dominating the competition, it feels like everything's going to plan, so there is a smile, he's enjoying the process. He's clearly showing that he's the best driver here so far. [in Portuguese] That's it. In the balance. [Neto] Let's go. Foot on the gas. [Rut] Neto giving his son some direction, going into this turn. - [MB] Spin it, baby. - [bang] [MH] Oh! Yes! [MB] That's how you do it. [Rutledge Wood] Unbelievable. [Michael Bisping] That is insane. [crowd cheers] [Rut] Carried so much speed and it was a late rotation, but he got super lucky there with where the car ended up aiming. That's really good. [Neto in Portuguese] There we go! Well done. Let's go. [MB] The hype is real. [MH] Now he's heading into Forced Perspective. Diego's been perfect on this obstacle in every one of his runs. [announcer] 100. [hosts] Whoa! [MH] Let's see if he made it through. Did he get it? [MB] Something went flying. - [bang] - [Rut] I think he just nicked it. [crowd groans] - [Diego in Portuguese]Did I hit it? - [Neto] You just hit your right mirror. I noticed just now. [MH] Yeah, I jinxed him, but that's a five-second penalty for Diego as he makes his way now to the Leveler. He'll be just out ahead of João's pace, but remember, the Sheriff balanced this out in just 32 seconds. Let's see if Diego can match it. [MB] Whoa! Oh. [Neto in Portuguese] Now's the time. Concentrate. Start to come down. Stop there. Stay still. Go, come down... stop. Come down... stop. Come back a little more, back. Stop! A little forward. Just a little, barely anything. Ah, passed it. Go up quickly! [Rut] Nice and easy. There. Stop! Come up and stop there. Stop! Stop, Diego! [MH groans] I have to go backwards! Don't you see that it's going down? Pay attention! I can see it's going down! [Rut] So much pressure to solve this on tonight's course. [in Portuguese] Forward a little. Stop! You've stopped. Stay still. [hosts chant] Six, seven, eight, nine... [MH] Ten! He got it! [Neto in Portuguese] You got it. Nice! Congratulations. [MB] Great job by dad, keeping Diego calm. [Rut] I can't imagine the pressure that Diego's dad must feel. [Neto] Let's go to the promised land. [engine roars] [Neto] Kick up dust! Let's go! [MH] Diego Higa off the Leveler, but he did lose some time on João's run. Let's see if he can make it up on the back half of this run. Hit the first, evade the second. [Rut] Coming into the Gauntlet. Here's a chance for him to outdo the Sheriff. - [bang] - [MB] Wow, sideways! - [MH] Wow. - [bang] [Neto in Portuguese] There we go, dude! - [crowd cheers] - [MB] God! Unbelievable! [in Portuguese] Well done! You passed it beautifully. [MH] Two for two on those targets and he stays on the path. He just gained 60 seconds on João! Is there anything this kid can't do? [Rut] He's not old enough to rent a car, but he can drive the hell out of one. [Neto] Let's go, you can do it. [bang] [Neto] You hit the first one. You hit the second one. - [Rut] Look at that! - [bang] [Neto] You hit the third. You hit the fourth. Let's go, water. Let's go target. [MH] Through Target Zone in one continuous drift. He's only got one obstacle left. - [bang] - [MH] Bam. [bang] [crowd cheers] [Neto in Portuguese] Let's go, dude! [MH] That's the way you do it, boy! - [MB] Look at that. - [Rut] Unbelievable. [MH] Diego Higa, putting down a run to remember. [MB] He's setting an example, he's sending a message, he's letting everybody know, "This is my tournament, I'm going to be the winner, I'm the champion, compete if you dare." [MH] "A child shall lead them," once again! [crowd cheers] [Mike Hill] 4:56.8. The 21 year old, killing the competition again. [in Portuguese] That was crazy. [Neto] Awesome! Congratulations! [Rut] He just beat João's time by 56 seconds. 56 seconds! [MB] That's not even close. Nowhere near. I don't know where my side-view mirror went, man! The mirror disappeared, dude! What do you think João's doing right now? [MB] Sitting there in disbelief, taking off his cowboy hat, saying: "This is ridiculous, it's not fair." Diego makes the Sheriff look a lot like the deputy, doesn't he? [talking in Portuguese] [MH] That jaw-dropping performance ensures Diego will be moving on to the finals. And as for Alex Graff, with the slowest time left on the board, he now knows he'll be fighting for survival in a head-to-head elimination race. The only question is, if he'll be facing off against Fielding Shredder, or our last driver to the line. [announcer] Driver seven, report to the start line. [engine starts] [Benny, in German] Get ready. You can do this. [MH] Corinna Graff, our final racer of the night, guys, only one step away from that championship round. [male announcer] Okay, Corinna, Let's move to the door. Here we go. [MH] And in what has to be a nightmare scenario for Corinna, if she can't stay out of the bottom two, she'll have to face off against her husband in that head-to-head elimination race. [Rut] But Mike, if there's anyone that can handle the pressure, it's Corinna. She's really been so comfortable on every single track, and she has put some great runs together. Now Corinna just needs to go out there, forget about her husband, and continue to perform at a high level. [engine revs] I'm a little worried about Alex, of course. He must go to the head-to-head. But now I must concentrate on my run. Don't think about his mistakes. I make no mistakes. I go on the track and kick some ass. [engine revs] Okay, ready to rock. Yeah, Benny. [MH] 7:0.8 the time to beat. Corinna holding Fielding's fate under her right foot. [Rut] Come on, Corinna. You've got this. [in German] Let it rip. Oh, I will. Thank you, Benny! - [engine roars] - [crowd cheers] [MH] Corinna Graff, looking to advance to the finals with this run. Let's see if she if she can make a statement right out of the gate. [in German] First thing today, you slide through the targets at the right turn. [MH] Here we go. - [bang] - [hosts] Yeah! [MH] Oh! That was beautiful. [MB] Blew that to smithereens. [bang] [in German] Yes! Very nice. [MH] The Drift Beast off to a solid start, just behind Fielding's pace, but she can make up time on him here with a clean run through Cyclone. [MB] A little point worth noting is that she's never done a moving 360 turn, certainly not one at 50 miles an hour. So fingers crossed, let's hope for the best. [in German] You can do it. Yeah, I'll have a go. [MH] Let's see what she does. Here she goes. [engine roars] [tires squeal] [hosts] Oh... [Rut] A little hiccup there, not quite smooth. [MB] Watch the clock. It's going to be close. Yes! [crowd cheers] [MH] Corinna avoids that 15-second penalty as she heads over to Forced Perspective. [in German] Very nice! At least we did it. [Benny] Fored Perspective up next. [MH] Remember, this is another obstacle that got the best of Fielding. Can she run through? [announcer] Distance to break wall, 200, 100. [Rut] She's through. [MH] Got it done. [MB] It was good. [Rutledge Wood] Oh... wow! [in German] Very nice, no errors! [MH] That's three obstacles down, no time penalties, and Corinna showing once again how she's made it so far here on Hyperdrive. She's a tactician every step of the way, and she's got the Leveler now in her sights. [Rut] And you notice, she's still right on Fielding's pace. Not traveling quite as fast between obstacles, but running through them clean is making up for that lack of speed. [Benny in German] Kill the Leveler and then it's all good. [MH] She could certainly make up a whole lot of time, and a lot of ground on this one. Remember, Fielding took max time here in his run, and that 30-second penalty along with it. [Benny] Coming down. [Rut] And this is an obstacle that's given so many drivers fits, but for Corinna, it's been the opposite. She's really very comfortable here. - [MB] This looks good. - [MH] Slow it, right. Go up a little bit. Not much. Not much. Slow it, right there. [in German] Stay there. [MB] This looks good. When will is this thing turn green? Just, right there. Stay. The tiniest bit. Ooh, it's like... You almost want to get out of the car and jump up and down. [Rut] Here it comes. [MB] Now back it up a touch. Just leave it there. Because it's in motion. You've got to counter the motion. [Rut] Look at it. She's going to do it. [MH] Eight, nine, ten! And she has done it yet again! [in German] Yes, drive forward... fantastic! [Rut] What a clutch performance, with her back against the wall, to solve that with 26 seconds to spare. She just gained a ton of time on Fielding there. [engine revs] [MH] Here she goes, three obstacles left, and Corinna is in the driver's seat. Coming up on the Gauntlet now. Remember, Diego's been the only driver to really nail this one, so let's see what she's got. [MB] She does seem to be taking it a little slow. - [bang] - [MH] Oh, but what's this? She's going to sit and wait? Now drive past the target. - [[MH] Is that legal? - [MB] technically it counts. - [bang] - [MH] I like it. [in German] Continue to the target, then doughnut. Here we go. Left. [Rut] She avoided any penalties. I'm not sure how much faster that was, but give her points for creativity. [Benny in German] Faster! [MH] Well, she's got a comfortable lead, so all she's got to do is bring it home clean now. [engine revs] [tires squeal] - [MH] Missed that one. - [MB] Man. [Benny in German] One. Two. [MB] Oh, she missed it. [Benny] Three. We need one more. [Corinna] What? [MH] Go back, get it. Keep driving. Benny, I thought we had them all. [Benny] Only one was missing, doesn't matter. [Rut] Come on, Corinna. - [bang] - [MH] Oh. [MB] Oh my word. [bang] [MH] Corinna Graff taking back-to-back penalties, and now that sizable lead has vanished. [MB] Come on, Corinna. Keep it together, now. [Rut] She's trying to avoid that head-to-head against her husband. [in German] Everything is fogging up. I can't see anything anymore. [Benny] Go straight forward. [MH] Corinna Graff with just 10 seconds to make it across the line. She can see the finish line, but can she do it? [MB] It's down to the wire. Come on! Let's go! [MH] Yes! [Rut] Oh my gosh. [MH] Beating out Fielding Shredder by three seconds. [crowd cheers] Woo-hoo! [in German] Amazing job, Corinna! Crazy! [Mike Hill] Corinna Graff, moving on to the Hyperdrive final. The Drift Beast showing once again she is for real. [Rut] She is awesome. [MB] She really is. She's flying the flag for her family, for Germany, and female drivers all over the world. [cheering and clapping] [in German] You kicked the Leveler in the butt again, Momma! Uh! [talking in German] [MH] So with that run, Corinna avoids a showdown with her husband, Alex. The Old Lion will instead have to face Fielding Shredder in our final head-to-head race of the season. A trip to the championship is on the line, and for these two, it's win or go home. [announcer] Drivers, prepare for launch. [engine revs] [MH] Here we go, final head-to-head of the season, and two guys not afraid to put it all out on the line. Remember Fielding, he quit his job to get ready for this competition. Alex wants to get into the top six, because he wants to win a Hyperdrive championship, but he also wants to have bragging rights at home, because Corinna, his wife, is already in the top six. [Rut] Now these two are no strangers to the pressure of the head-to-head. Fielding won his way back in through the Wildcard tournament, and Alex eliminated Brittany Williams later that same night. Alex is the more experienced driver overall, but Fielding's shown no fear attacking this track. To me, this one's a coin flip. [engines rev] You got this, just commit to that e-brake. Remember, you're good. Copy, yep. [Jacqueline in German] Everything good in there? It's all good. [Jacqueline] Take him out. [MH] One last race to decide who moves on to the finale. Here we go. [MH] Who is it going to be? [MB] Fielding takes a quick lead ever so slightly. [MH] Their first target, really key. [two bangs] [Rut] Both got it. [Jacqueline] Got it. [Shellen] Got it, go. [MH] It is close. [MB] Watch Fielding. [MH] Bam, wow. Woo! - [MH] Oh man. - [Rut] Yes. [MB] Wow. [Rut] Neck-and-neck into the second turn. [bang] [MB] Whoa! [bang] [MH] They both get the target, only the barrel left. [MB] Fielding is in the lead. [Rut] Look at this, come on guys. [MH] The German drifter, the Wild Child from Texas. [bleep] [MH] This is close. [Rut] It's going to be a drag race. Woo-hoo! [MH] It's going to be a drag race! - Oh, Alex tales a penalty! - [Rut] No way! So Fielding Shredder is moving on to the finals! [laughs] That was close. - [MB] Wow! - [MH] Fielding Shredder has done it! That was so close, good job. [Michael Bisping] Oh my God! [Rut] Look, there's the smile. Fielding got out there and did what he does so well. He had fun, and he is moving on. Guys, what a race though. Give a lot of credit to Alex Graff. His effort was phenomenal the entire time out here. [in German] Did he get both targets? Yes, he got both. [bleep] [Alex in German] I was this close to getting to the finals, but it wasn't meant to be. I had an awesome time, and my wife is still in the game, still racing. I hope my wife can win, and claim the Hyperdrive title for Germany. Alex, killer lap, man. Oh man. - Good driver. - Thank you. You too. Honestly, at the line it was a little nerve racking. Alex is an incredible driver, but more than anything, I wanted to really drive this final course. The big monster is the big mamajama. It's got every obstacle that I love, it's very suited for drifting, so nothing was going to stop me cross that line first. Good luck for this race. Thank you very much. [MH] Fellas, what another exciting ending to a wonderful night on the course. Fielding Shredder, keeping the US hopes alive in Hyperdrive. It was unbelievable! I can't wait! And this next track is going to be even crazier, and we still get to see Fielding do this again. [MH] So make sure you strap back in for the race that will decide it all. It's the best against the best in a battle for the ultimate prize. We are down to the final six in the Hyperdrive finale, and guess what? You ain't got to wait, because it starts right now.
