 [female announcer] Knockout Round Two. Track is hot. [Diego Higa in Portuguese] With every race I feel nervous. Before starting... I pray a lot. I confess. My clutch foot starts to shake. I get scared. But a driver can't think about these things. I always have to think that nothing will affect me.

 I can't think that I might crash or that I will crash. I can't let that thought get stuck in my head, because... the things we believe come true. [cheering and clapping from crowd] [Mike Hill] Y'all see who's out there, the baby-faced assassin, the 21-year-old Diego Higa out of Brazil, ready to kick off Knockout Two. [Neto in Portuguese] Are you calm? I don't know. [Neto] Breathe deeply. Stay calm. You run this, man.

 It's so easy. Everything's going to work out. [MH] Getting some encouraging words from his father and spotter, Neto. So let's take a look at what Diego has to contend with here. Got two targets in the first turn, those narrow shipping containers at Thread the Needle, and the finish, we we've got a brand new obstacle. It's called the Gauntlet, and wait until you see this one. The course designers might have lost their minds when they built this track. The toughest one yet. Does the young Diego Higa have what it takes to conquer it? [Neto in Portuguese] Good luck, son. [engine revs] [Mike Hill] Let's go! [engine roars] [Rutledge Wood] There we go. [MH] He's got two targets coming up here in the first turn. - [bang] - [hosts] Whoa! [in Portuguese] You hit both. [Rutledge Wood] That is how you do it, baby. Diego Higa moving on to Thread the Needle, which has a new layout and has got an added target. Now you see him pass it right there, but that's alright. He can pick it up at any point during this obstacle. [Neto in Portuguese] Let's go. [Michael Bisping] Here he goes. Three cargo containers. He's got to shoot through them, spin on 180 as fast as he can, and then get through the other. [bang] [MH] Picks up that target he missed on his way into the second container. [MB] That was so smart, the way he did that. [Rut] Really bringing a lot of speed in there. [MB] Amazing control. [Rut] And you notice he doesn't over-rotate. He knows that car so well. [MB] Wow. He's spinning round, lining himself up for that next container like a pro. [MH] Out of Thread the Needle in just 29 seconds, off to a great start. He hopes to win this competition, to put his name amongst the best drivers in the world, and making a huge name for himself here. Now it's into Pipe City, It's got a single target at the entrance. [bang] - [bang] - [MB] My word. [in Portuguese] Sensational, son. Let's go. [MH] Aced that. What's next, Rut? [Neto in Portuguese] Go! [Rut] Okay, he's got a bump target at the end of this corridor. - [bang] - [Neto] Come back quickly. [Rut] Now he's got to throw it in reverse and execute a tight Rockford turn to exit. [engine roars] - [bang] - [crowd] Oh! [MB] No way! [MH] Lost control and slammed his car into the K-rail. [Rut] That was hugely lucky that it wasn't a concrete K-rail. [MH] The first big mistake we've seen from the youngster. [in Portuguese] You messed up. You did it wrong. Big-head. Oh, shoot. The whole car is misaligned. [Neto] Now you just have to go like that, right. [Diego] This is horrible. My God. Let's go. [Rut] Look at him fighting the car. That crash threw Diego's alignment completely out of whack. His steering is shot. He's really going to have to be careful here. [Diego in Portuguese] We'll fix it afterwards. [Neto] It must have bent the whole thing. We'll fix it afterwards. [Rut] He's got four targets to hit in Manji Alley. This is going to be so tough with steering issues. [bang] [MB] Oh! He got it. [bang] [Neto] Beautiful. [bang] [Neto] Beautiful. One more. Well done. [Rut] How did he hit those targets with that steering issue? That's insane. [MH] Now Diego's going to have to push his damaged car up the Leveler, but this time around he'll only have 90 seconds to balance it. Not to mention the fact that the balance zone is even slimmer this time around. [in Portuguese] Pay attention here now, for the love of God. Calm down. Ready. [MH] Oh, and one more thing. There's now a 30-second time penalty for failing the obstacle. [Michael Bisping] Alright, let's go. A little wide. [Rut] A bit wobbly getting up there, still fighting that alignment. [Neto in Portuguese] It's free. Come back. More? Come back. [MH] This is when you really listen to your spotter. [Neto] Come back, the longer it takes the better you are coming back There. Stay there. Go just a tiny hair forward. There. [MB] So difficult to find the right spot. [Neto] Just a hair forward. Just a hair. [MH] He's got to go up. [Neto] There. [Rut] It's a game of inches. Do you see that? [MB] That's got to be the perfect spot. It has to be. [Neto] Just another hair. The car is light, bro. [MB] You can hear the surprise in the tone of voice of his father there, He just can't believe what he's seeing, because it looks like you would tip the balance forward and it still continues to move backwards. [MH] It's got to go up a bit more. Give it just a little push forward... [Neto] There. That's it. Jeez, this takes so long, bro. [MH] Less than 30 seconds remaining. The Leveler moves so much at the slightest of inches. If anyone's ever been that one kid alone by yourself in the playground, trying to play on a seesaw, like I might have been, I understand this. [MH] Fifteen seconds left. It's now or never. [Neto] There! Stop, Diego. - [MB] Don't move! - [Rut] He's on there. [Neto] You went too far back, Diego. Stop, it's already counting. Still. Just a pin to the front. Very small. There. [everyone cheers] [Neto] You passed it! [MH] Solves it with one second remaining and avoids that 30-second penalty. [in Portuguese] Go! [MH] Diego fighting to finish this course with a damaged car. [Neto] Go! Drive a million now, let's go! [MH] Heading into a brand new obstacle, the Gauntlet. Drivers are going to have a tough time keeping their cars on the road here. That's the challenge, right Rut? [Rut] Talk about intimidating, driving toward three cars hanging from the rafters here, and you've got to dance your way through. [MH] Somehow Diego's got to pass through the gates hanging from the first and third car, while picking up that target between them. [Rut] He's through, but he's off the path. That's going to cost him. [MH] Got the target and exits clean, but that is one mistake you cannot make at the Gauntlet. [Rut] He veered off the track to get through that gate. That's a max time penalty. You just screwed up, bro. [Diego] Damn! [MB] Ah, man. [MH] Very disappointing. [Rut] That is Diego's first-ever penalty, here in Hyperdrive. [MH] Got to wonder if that alignment issue caused him to make that mistake, as he comes roaring across the finish line. [crowd cheers] [MB] And I think he's just jeopardized his position in this race. [Rut] It was still a good run, but this course just sent a message. Bring your A-game or you're going to pay. [in Portuguese] My God, dude. The poor car is done, dude. [bleep] [Neto] It's not done at all. That is a war tank. [crowd cheers] [applause] Diego, this is the first time that we've seen you look like you've had any sort of difficulty on a race track. How were you able to keep your focus and press on through? [in Portuguese] After I crashed the car, I knew I would have problems. I knew I wouldn't be able to drive the same, or get the time I wanted. So I just focused on doing the best I could. I don't know if I'll have the top time. But the important thing is that I can continue in the competition, that I survive so that I can race again. [MH] Alright, we've got one on the board, and here's how the night's going to break down. Just like Knockout One, all eyes will be on the bottom three. Last place finisher will be eliminated, while the next two slowest drivers will have to fight for their survival in a head-to-head race. [female announcer] Track is hot. Driver two, report to the start line. [Jordan] I'm going to start the car. [engine starts] [MH] With this Knockout Two course already bearing its teeth, Jordan Martin pulled to the line in his Lambourghini Huracan. Fresh off his narrow escape in the first head-to-head, he was hungry to take advantage of his new lease on life. [engine revs] [Jordan] In the first knockout round I was in the bottom three, and it was this close, I barely made it through. I don't want to be in that position again. I've proven at least to this point that I can keep up with the drift cars, and I'm hoping to just keep that theory alive. [engine revs] [MH] Listen to that! Once again, Jordan's 1,000 horsepower mechanical marvel was beaten in to submission by the precision elements of the course. - [bang] - [hosts] Oh! [MH] He's having a little trouble. - [MB] He clipped the front. - Son of a [bleep]. [crowd groans] [MH] Jordan's only option was to save his run by balancing the Leveler. It'll be a walk in the park, right? We really screwed it up last time. [MH] But the mid-west MacGyver's mathematical solution... One, two, three. [MH] ...failed to equal out. One, two, three. Go forward, forward two feet. No offense, I'm not listening to you. I'm just going to do it. [spotter] Forward.Forward. [MH] It's over, that's a 30-second penalty. Oh, that sucks. [MH] After watching the course humble Diego, and humiliate Jordan, three of the top contenders, Axel Francois, Alex Graff, and Atsushi Taniguchi strapped in to show they could be the first to tame this beast. I am ready, really ready. [MH] Here we go. [MH] But almost immediately, the pressure of this second knockout round forced each driver into uncharacteristic mental mistakes. [MH] Oh! Missed them both. - [Alex in German] Did we get them all? - Doesn't matter, keep driving. [in French] Go back in the same container, Alex! Go back! [MH] Oh man, he went the wrong way in the container. [MB] He'll get max time for that. [in French] Exit and hit the target. [bang] [in Japanese] Let's finish Manji targets fast! [MH] And the width. [MB] Ah, missed that one. [Rut] This does not look like the Drift Sensei right now. [in Japanese] Drift fail! [MH] All three drivers needed to balance the Leveler to save their runs. [in German] A bit forward, Papa. It's not going. [MH] But one by one... [MH] The Leveler does not want to move. [MB] Maybe just get out of the car and jump up and down a little. [MH] ...they all fell... ...down. [in French] Stop. Don't move. [hosts yell excitedly] [crowd groans] I told you not to move, Axel. I just want to know where the pillars are. [MH] And with one last kick at the Gauntlet... [in German] No! [bang] - [bang] - [MB] Ten seconds. [in Japanese] Go! [MH] ...this course sent them all back to the pits, to lick their wounds. [in French] Well, that was crap. [MH] At five racers down, let's look at the latest leaderboard. See Diego Higa still there in first place, guys. but the real story is in red. [Rut] Wow, look at all those penalties. A minute ten, a minute 30, a minute 50. This track is dominating everyone. We leveled up so big, I don't think the drivers knew, when we said it was going to get harder every time, we meant that. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver six, report to the start line. [engine turns over] [engine starts] [MH] There he is, the Sheriff from Brazil, João Barion. We saw his countryman, Diego Higa, stumble a bit here in Knockout Two. But even so, guys, Diego has stolen the spotlight from João so far. [MB] Mike, for once I actually agree with you. What, really? It's crazy. It's one of those nights. As you say, not getting the attention that Diego has. And these two actually have a history. They're good friends from the same town, but believe it or not, it was Diego who first introduced João to drifting. [João in Portuguese] When we got here, Diego and I... didn't know we would be facing each other. It was a surprise. - What's up, driver? - What's up, driver? - All good? - Everything's good. Diego is not just my competition. He actually taught me how to drift. [Diego] When he rode with me, he went crazy. He said, "Dude, I need this." - [tires squeal] - [laughs] [João] Now he is my friend, and I am business partners with his dad. [laughing] Oh, man! [João] We're always together, participating in the same competitions in Brazil. [crowd cheers] [João] Sometimes I win, sometimes he wins. But... I think Diego regrets teaching me so well. [engine roars] [both laughing] [João] Because now I'm his biggest competition here. [Diego] Now, after everything I've taught João, I even joke and say... I've taught him too much. Hey! Teach me well, - because I want to beat you. - [laughs] [João] I learned a lot with him these past few years, but I think it's time to show that I've exceeded him, and I'm here to win. [engine revs] [engine revs] [Mike Hill] João Barion. [Nando in Portuguese] You hear me, bro? [in Portuguese] Loud and clear, bro. Show off why you came, eh? [João] That's it, bro. [MH] As we've seen, this track has been eating drivers alive so far tonight, so the door is wide open for João to send a message to the field. [crowd cheers] [MH] He's got the car. He showed us the skills. Can the Sheriff deliver? [tires squeal] [MB] Wow! [MH] Let's see what he's got. Remember, Diego killed these. [Rut] Come on, Sheriff, show 'em how it's done. [MH] There it is. Yeah. [MB] That's how you do it. [in Portuguese] Nice, bro! You got them both! [MH] Headed to Thread the Needle, and again, he can pick up that target he passed at any point during this obstacle. [Rut] How fast can he push this huge Mustang through these narrow containers? [MB] I for one think he's going to push it as much as he can. The Sheriff wants to prove to everyone he's the top contender here. [bang] Everyone's been talking, Diego this, Diego that. Now it's his turn for revenge. Now it's his chance to steal the show. [Rut] We just saw the Sheriff grab that other target there, spin it around. He's still bringing a lot of speed in for something that's so big. [MB] A lot of speed. [in Portuguese] That's it! Kick up some dust! Go for it! Get out of there! You got them both, let's go! [MH] Out of there in 23 seconds, a little faster than Diego. Now remember, before the competition he said that Diego was intimidated by him, so I think he's trying to send a message, not just to the rest of the field, but especially to Diego. [MB] He's not playing safe here. He's absolutely going for it. [Rut] And now another target coming up. - [bang] - [MB] Nailed it! [Rut] Look at that. That's beauty at work right there. That's exactly how that course was designed, to hit it just like that. [MH] João Barion flying through Pipe City, about to hit this bump target. [engine revs] [bang] And Rockford turn. [Rut] João's being very deliberate. You've got to imagine he's thinking about Diego, who threw his car into a wall here. [engine revs] [crowd cheers] [MH] Perfectly executed. [MB] Going out there and putting on a lap like this, this is going to give him even more confidence. Look at the speed he's going at. [MH] He's wide open. [Rut] 800 horsepower through the smoke. [MB] Let's go, Sheriff! [in Portuguese] Perfect, Let's go! [Rut] The Sheriff is smoking them right now. Look at that speed! [MH] Coming up on Manji Alley. Let's check out this bad boy go side-to-side. - [bang] - [MH] That's one target. [bang] [Rut] Oh, got it. [bang] [MH] Spun out after that one. He's got to get back on track. [spotter] Go! Get out of there! [bang] [Rut] He recovered just fine, because he brought so much speed into it. [MH] It's time for the Leveler, and look at that, João has a comfortable lead on Diego. If he can balance this Leveler out, it's all over. [in Portuguese] Going very well so far. Now go very calmly, dude. Done! [MH] He's going in, baby. [MB] Let's go Sheriff, 357 Magnum. Look at that, nice. [MH] Taking it deep, so it's going to go down quicker. [in Portuguese] Start going back. [MB] Not too much. There. [MB] Leave it there. Go back. [Rut] Come on, Sheriff. Come on, buddy. [MB] Whoa, go forward a little bit. Ever so slightly, that's it. No! [Rut] Oh! So close. [in Portuguese] Bro, slower... [MB] Come on. He deserves this to go well after driving so well, hitting all those targets, being so impressive. [in Portuguese] Forward a bit. [Rut] He's taken so much weight out of the rear of that car, he's got to stay nose-forward of the center point. [in Portuguese] Go back a little bit. There. That's good! Go a little bit forward. There. Stay there. [MB] He keeps going past the center line, which is not what he wants to do. [MH] Taking a lot of time, which means he's losing a lot of time. [in Portuguese] There. Hold it there. [MB] Stay there! [in Portuguese] Don't go back, dude! [MH] Come on. Leveled out, just wait. It's tough to be patient. [in Portuguese] A little forward. [MH] It is tough to be patient, but he's got to be. [MB] So frustrating to watch. [Rut] It's right there. Stay! [in Portuguese] Stay there! [MB] 30 seconds. [MH] What are you doing!? [hosts groan in frustration] [Rut] I don't think he knows that he didn't get that. [MH] Huge mistake there. I don't know if João realized he had to keep it balanced for 10 seconds. Now he's used the full clock and the 30-second max time penalty. [engine roars] [spotter] C'mon. Let's go! [Rut] I'm sure he's kicking himself. He's lost his cushion over Diego, but Diego did take a 60-second penalty at the Gauntlet. If João can just keep his car on the track, he's still in position to take first place. - [bang] - [MB] Ah, man! - [bang] - [MB] Yes. Come on. - [bang] - [MH] Oh! [MH] That's 20 seconds of penalties. [Rut] That's okay, he still picked up time there. Stayed on the track, mission accomplished. [spotter in Portuguese] Go, man. Go! [MH] Coming down the home stretch, looking to show that he is the Brazilian to beat. And he does it! He's in first place. [crowd cheers] [MB] Wow! [Rut] A 28-second lead over the field, despite those costly penalties. Still a great result, but I guarantee you he is not happy. The big indicator here was no showing off after that lap, right? There was no doughnuts, no celebration. [MB] No victory dance. [MH] So this time around, the student defeats the teacher, as João Barion sits atop Diego on the leaderboard. And with only four racers left, Jordan, Axel and Atsushi are in the bottom three, awaiting their fate. [announcer] Driver seven, report to the start line. - [spotter] Hey, babe, can you hear me? - I can hear you. [spotter] Sweet, I got you. [MH] Alright, next up on the course is Brittany Williams, the 27 year old from Texas. Not the most experienced driver here, but she's been a huge surprise so far. [engine starts] [spotter] We're going to pull up. Here we go. [Brittany] My car is a little bit slower and my skill level is... it's not bad, but it's definitely not to the caliber of some of these other drivers. My goal is to try not to be nervous, because when I get nervous, that's actually when I tend to screw up. A few people before me, they haven't done great. If I can go out there and lay down a good lap, hopefully I can fall somewhere ahead of them, and stay out of the elimination rounds. [engine revs] [crowd cheers] Oh my God, look at my mom. She's like... [laughs] Woo! Got this, Brittany. Yee-ha! Hi, Mom. [laughs] [MH] Brittany Williams got a very close relationship with her mom, and you can just hear the love she's getting from her there. I love you. I love you, baby. You got this, alright? I was talking to my mom, but I love you too. - Good luck. You got this. - [Brittany laughs] [applause] [MH] Brittany Williams, ready for launch. Let's see what she's got. [crowd cheers] [Mike Hill] Let's go! Coming up on those targets in the first turn. [MB] Missed. You'll get it on the way back. Don't worry about it. Alright, dang it. [Rut] Brittany will pass back through that section. An interesting wrinkle in the course tonight with those first two targets. Drivers will have a second chance to pick them up after completing Thread the Needle. [Rut] Nicely done. There you go. - [engine revs] - Line up. [tires squeal] [MB] She's doing a great job of spinning that car around. [Rut] Not just that, Bis. She's taking these containers with a fair amount of speed. There we go. [MH] She's got one more. Not making any mistakes. [Kevin] Make sure you hit that target. You got it. - [bang] - [hosts] Oh! Front bumper. I saw it. [MH] Hit it with the front of the car, that's going to cost her. [Rut] She's got to hit these targets clean. Come out wide, clutch kick... There you go. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! - [buzzer] - [hosts] Oh! [Rut] You definitely see she's a bit flustered, not as composed as she's been before. It's okay. It's alright. You got the first one. It's okay. Just make it through. [sighs] These targets are like, my worst enemy. [MB] Unfortunately, there's a few more to come. [MH] Absolutely. Yeah, just bigger clutch kicks, a little more speed. Here comes this one. Get some speed. Big clutch kick or E-brake. - [bang] - [MH] There it is. There you go. [MB] Yeah, Brittany. [applause] [bang] [Kevin] There you go, perfect. [Rut] We know Brittany has the skill to hit these targets, but it's all about consistency now. These knockout round courses will eat you alive if you can't stay in the throttle and commit to your drifts. The time it takes to go back and clean up a target is a killer. Go ahead, you got it. [MH] Can she execute this Rockford turn? [tires squeal] - [crowd cheers] - [MH] Perfectly done. [Rut] She committed to that turn, you see the results, but headed to Manji Alley now. This run might just come down to how she handles the four targets waiting for her there. Show these boys how to do it. Come on, you got this. You can do this. [MH] Can she avoid any penalties? [bang] [MH] Another penalty right there. [Lori] No! [Kevin] Keep going. [MH] She is falling apart at the seams right now. - [Kevin] Keep going. - [Brittany] Yikes! [Kevin] Quit letting off the gas. - [bang] - [MB] Got that one, okay. You got to quit letting off the gas. You got to power through it, Britt. Here we go, baby. Here's the Leveler. [MH] Brittany Williams, in danger of sinking to the bottom of the leaderboard, needs to beat Atsushi's time to avoid the head-to-head. Let's see a smile. Just relax. You're fine. [exhales nervously] This is it. Listen to your spotter. Conquer you once, I can conquer you twice. [Kevin] Go! [MH] One thing we know about this Leveler, it can make or break your run. There's a ton of pressure on her here. [Kevin] There we go, okay.Come back. Come back. Little bit. Back. Back, back, back. [MB] Spotter's doing a fantastic job of talking her through this. - Too far? - [Kevin] A little bit forward. - Right there. Stop! - [Brittany] There you go. Stay right there. Back. Right there, Stop! Keep going. Too far back. [MB] No, Don't move! What? [Kevin] Stop. - [Brittany] It's coming up. Good? - [Kevin] Stay there. Forward just a tiny bit. [Lori] Woo! [Kevin] Right there. [crowd cheers] [MH] She got it! She made up a lot of time. [MB] Wow! Started off poorly, missed a few targets, got some penalties, but she just nailed the Leveler, and that is massive on this course. - Yes! - [MH] That was huge. That is going to help her tremendously as she works her way towards the Gauntlet. The Gauntlet is all you. I don't know what to tell you, honey. You just do what you want to do. There's nobody that's made it. We have no idea. Blast through it, drift through it, I don't care. Just stay on the track. - [bang] - [Brittany] Dang it! [bang] [engine revs] Yeah! - Hell, yeah! - [MH] Wow! [Kevin] Go! [laughs] [MH] And here she comes. Brittany Williams from Texas. It is not how you start but how you finish. [MB] Wow, guys. [cheering] Hell yeah, baby! [MH] That deserves a celebration. Go ahead and get those doughnuts. Wow! So you do know how to hit the throttle. [MB] And the spotter, as you said, did such a fantastic job. It's like being in a fight, and at the end of the round, you've had your ass kicked. Your corner man can make a big difference. Corner man sits you down and says, "Okay, take a deep breath. Smile. It's all good. You're going to get this. Go out there and enjoy yourself. You have a good performance." That's exactly what he did. She had a lot of penalties with the targets but she saved so much time on the Leveler, there's no way it's not the fastest time. How about a mic-drop after that one? Talk about rebounding a run. What is going through your mind right now? I'm actually pumped now. [laughs] The Leveler is a massive wild card, because you can be the best driver, but if you can't level that, it's huge time. But that's why I rely on having Kevin in my ear, telling me, you know, chill out a little bit, and try not to let it freak me out. You did a fantastic job. That was an incredible run. Thank you. I can't believe your're standing here with a smile on your face after the way that started, girl. [MH] So Brittany Williams comes out and amazes yet again. And not only is she safe from elimination, but with that masterful performance at the Leveler, she just beat out Diego. On the other side of the ledger, the bottom three has remained as is, with only three drivers left in Knockout Two. [announcer] Driver eight, report to the start line. [MH] After Brittany Williams showed that a successful run wouldn't always be pretty, next into the blocks were the night's two remaining female drivers, and they strapped in, determined to battle for a place at the top of the leaderboard, no matter what this relentless Knockout Two course threw at them. [engines roar] - [MH] Wow, what a takeoff! - [MB] Look at that! [MH] Both Corinna and Sara missed the first two targets. [MB] Missed it! [Rut] Come on, Sara. [MH] Oh! Missed them both. - [MB] Missed them both. - Oops. [in German] You missed it. Keep driving. [MH] But they recovered nicely at Pipe City... [bang] ...and were right back in the game. [Rut] There we go. You got it. Good! Keep going. [MH] Still, neither drifter could handle the curves at Manji Alley. [MH] Messed it up. [MB] Oh, my word. - [buzzer] - [MH] Oh, missed one. [in German] Screw it. [spotter] Keep going. [MH] When they arrived at the Leveler... Alright, let's do this. [MH] ...they knew they had no choice but to follow Brittany's lead and show up the boys. [MH] Sara Haro, the underdog. [MB] Ah, come on. Be patient, okay. Leave it there. [MB] Back up a touch, leave it there now. [MH] Oh, I think she got it. [spotter] Got it. [MH] Seven, eight, nine, ten. - She got it! - [cheering] - You did it! - Yay! [MH] She got it! Now show me the horizon. [Rut] Watch her. She wanted to do this herself. Oh, guys... you can see the focus on her face. [in German] Kill the Leveler and then it's all good. [MB] I think she's got it. [hosts] Nine, ten. - [MH] Go, baby! - [cheering] - [in German] Seriously? Woo-hoo. - Amazing job, Corinna. [Rut] The time that she saved there will hopefully help her for those targets that she did not hit. [spotter in German] Beast mode! Give it! [MH] As they roared across the finish line, Sara in fifth place, and Corinna in a dominant second, both were safe from elimination and riding high from cracking the Leveler. [crowd cheers] I think it's a woman's obstacle. Yeah, we have the feeling for the balance. All the other guys have not made it in good time. The women are better. [Mike Hill] Nine racers down and the leaderboard is filling out, so the pressure is mounting. Jordan Martin sits at the bottom, in danger of instant elimination, while Atsushi Taniguchi and Axel Francois have the next two slowest times. So as it stands right now, they're in the hot seat, ready to face off in our second head-to-head. [announcer] Track is hot. Prepare for launch. [spotter] One minute, Fielding. Got me? [MH] It's time for our final driver, here in Knockout Two. It's the Wild Child, Fielding Shredder, and I've two questions for you guys. What is Fielding going to tear up this time? And what concoction is he going to invent to actually fix it? [Rut] This guy seemed unstoppable. He had a problem getting water in the engine bay. What did he do? He used some old mud flaps and changed his whole intake system. He busted up the front bumper and the rear bumper. He's fixed that with some zip ties. I think what he is going to tear up next is the course. He has watched drivers go out there and just do okay. He's not an okay kind of guy. He's wide open, every single lap. The course is set up for drifting, which I'm very excited about. So I'm turning up the boost. I'm ready to send this thing hot. Grip-drive a little bit more, and then hike the horsepower up as high as I can get it. [crowd cheers] [MH] Fielding Shredder. Hi Mom. Hi Dad. This one's for you. [MH] As you may remember, his father suffered a massive stroke eight years ago, so his dad is at home right now, watching this race. Fielding has to beat Jordan Martin's time of 8:54 to avoid instant elimination, and Atsushi Taniguchi's time of eight minutes to avoid going into that head-to-head. Here we go. Let's get it. Keep it tidy. Ten-four. [MH] Fielding Shredder, ready to put on a show. [crowd cheers] And he's off. [MB] He was talking a big game back there. Now this is his chance to back it up. - [bang] - [hosts] Whoa! [MH] Made it look easy. [cheering] [MB] That was incredible. [MH] He is holding nothing back. [Rut] Sweeping through that first big turn on his way to the barrel turn. - Here we go. - [MH] Look at that. [cheering] [MB] That's why he talks a big game, because he knows the skills he's got. Straight through Thread the Needle, didn't pause for a second. [Rut] Here we go. Hit that target. [MH] Missed it, but he can get it coming back. [Rut] Almost, he'll get it. [MB] He got flip side. [MH] He got close. [Rut] He did. Look at that. [MH] Here he goes. Oops, got that one. - [Rut] Clipped his mirror. - You're good. [MH] This dude knows one speed. [MB] By far the fastest anybody's started this track so far. [spotter] Got it. Go! [Rut] He's not going to go any easier. It's going to be that hard the whole time. [MH] Wow! - [MB] No! - [Rut] Oh! - [MB] Too much. - [Fielding] Oh, God. - [crash] - [crowd groans] [MB groans] [MH] Guys, Fielding. [MB] Oh my God. [Rut] Oh man. [guy] Safety, go quick! [girl] Is he okay? [MH] Overcooked it, slams into the building. [girl] How did it even happen? [bleep] Such a shame. [Corinna] He was too [bleep]. [Rut] Unbelievable. [guy] He was going in there at like, 80 miles an hour. [Rut] That window is down, guys. Our safety team is there with him. [MH] Let's listen inside his car right now. I'm good. I got no power. [MB] He's okay. - That's the main thing. - Oh, he's fine. [Rut] He's not hurt, but his car is done. [bleep] [MB] Man, he hit that wall dead on. Full impact. Full speed. [Rut] Honestly, it's a really lucky thing he backed it in at that angle. It's a much safer impact than either head-on or on the side, which can be even worse. Honestly, I was just talking to him. He was full of smiles. He was all ready to go out here and crush the course. But you've got to give it the respect it deserves, because this is what can happen. Oh God! [crash] [guy] Oh my God. [Rut] The great news is that Fielding's okay. We were seeing a guy who knew he had a chance to be number one on that board, and that first half-a-lap was the best and fastest driving we've seen him do on the course yet. Unfortunately, too much power caused the car to rotate into the wall. [MH] As you see there, his car is in pieces. As for Fielding, well, his competition is over. Mentally devastated, but thank God, physically he's okay. [Lindsay] Fielding, I watched you. I watched your car roll off that track. What was going through your mind? I'm just pissed off. I can't believe I did that. I've crashed the car worse than this before. But in Texas it's a couple hundred people, maybe a couple thousand at best, and now there's millions of people, it's like, "Why did I have to do it now?" I was set up for a hell of a lap, and then I wasn't. I love taking risks, but it didn't pan out. - [bang] - [onlookers groan] Fielding, you've been so much fun to watch. Thank you. Alright. [Rut] Hard not to think about Fielding's dad right now. You know, he really wanted to go out here and perform as well as he could, so that it could mean something to his dad, and hopefully his dad would be able to see that "That's my son on the TV, putting on that show." He is crushed, man. [applause] [MB] You know what? From the moment we met him, he lived up to his name, lived up to his hype, delivered a show each and every time, so he did his father proud, for sure. [MH] Fielding Shredder's competition is officially done. The top seven advance, of course, and it's time to find out who will join them. Two drivers going into the head-to-head, but as you know, only one can survive. [male announcer] ACP for Axel. Check. [in French] Thank you, sweetie. [announcer] One minute to head-to-head, Jordan. [MH] Once again we see Jordan Martin in the head-to-head in that Lamborghini. He's facing off against Axel Francois this time, and Rut, look at these two cars. They couldn't be more different. [Rut] That's right. You've got Jordan's $200,000 supercar versus Axel's built-in-a-barn drift car. Axel's a fearless driver, so he'll have the advantage throughthe turns, but even before his car started smoking, he had less than half the horsepower that Jordan's got. So you're saying? Guys, believe it or not, I think Jordan might have this one. [MH] Alright, here we go, guys. It's USA's Jordan Martin taking on Axel Francois... France's last hope in this competition. This car wiil be on Craigslist with the title of "Lambo killer." [engine revs] [MH] Jordan Martin of course, the supercar, the last non-drifter in this race. [spotter] Starting in all-wheel-drive, correct? Correct, and then around the right hander, I've got to disengage. [MH] We are ready to get going, here in the second head-to-head. [engines rev] [MH] Here we go, and... Oh! The Lambo flying out of the gate. [Rut] But Axel's got the inside lane, he's got a chance to make it up. [bang] [MH] Oh, hit those targets at the same time. [Rut] Wow, look at Axel. [MH] Whoa! [MB] Jordan's taking it way too slow. [MH] Axel's flying! Can he hold it through this last turn? - [bang] - [MB] Wow! - [bang] - [MH] Whoa! [Rut] Come on, Jordan. Show him your speed. [MH] One last barrel turn. The Lambo's still got a chance, so Axel's got to be perfect. [MB] Here we go. Oh! [MH] Oh, Jordan hits the K-rail, and that might be it. Axel across the finish line, andhe's going to survive another round here on Hyperdrive. [crowd cheers] [MB] It wasn't even close. Axel make it look easy. Jordan. Sorry. [Rut] Wow. You've got to give Jordan some credit there. He's trying so hard to do something with that car that it was never designed to do. It never works, running from the cops. They always win. I would say our showing certainly could have been worse. Among all the non-drift cars, I made it furthest, which at least that's good. We went onto a drift course to battle it out, and Axel's an excellent drift driver. He made no mistakes. I made a mistake. Home I go. Well, that could have gone better. [Axel, in French] Jordan is one of the best competitors. He's a really good driver. He's always calm, always focused on what he's doing. And he has an extraordinary car as well. But on this shorter course, My car is a little slower but more maneuverable. And in fact, that maneuverability helped me here. Woo-hoo-hoo! Wow! [kiss] Lambo killer! [MH] Another phenomenal knockout round here on Hyperdrive. Axel Francois continues to limp on in that car, but unfortunately for Jordan Martin, in that beautiful Lamborghini, we got to say bye-bye. He's been eliminated. And how about Fielding Shredder? He may be rethinking his approach now. That's right. He said he wanted to be reckless and he was certainly that, but unfortunately, too reckless. Went round that corner far too hard, wrote the car off, we've got to say goodbye. Team USA took a big hit, but two drivers from the US are moving on. How about Sara Haro and Brittany Williams? The ladies. Listen, we told them each track is going to get harder, it's going to level up, and they put on a show, they move on. [MH] And throw Corrina Graff in that mix. We are down to the elite eight. It's about to level up. As Rut said, it's getting even harder, and it starts right now. [announcer] Track is hot, prepare for launch.
