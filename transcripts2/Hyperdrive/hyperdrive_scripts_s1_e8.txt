 [Rutledge Wood] Hey, can I have everyone's attention? Everyone, just gather around. Everyone gather around nice and tight. Just squeeze in here. Thank you. So... in these first leveled-up races, to see what you guys have done with your cars and your skills, it's been special to watch, but unfortunately five of you have been eliminated here in the Knockout Rounds: Faruk, Fielding, Jordan, Alexander, Sara... You guys put it all on the line. That passion that you showed behind the wheel,

 your determination was unbelievable. And when this competition was conceived, a unique opportunity was built in that could get you back on the track. So if you're interested, there is a chance for you to compete one more time. We're all ears. [Rut] You five have the opportunity to enter the Hyperdrive Last Chance head-to-head tournament. Alright? Here's how it's going to work. You five will go in for a series of head-to-head battles. One of you is going to come out a winner and get back into this competition with a chance to compete for the Hyperdrive championship. Dude, that's insane.

 - You're telling me there's a chance. - [Rut] That's right. This is going to be something epic, and I don't use that word lightly. Hell, yeah. Getting back into this competition with a second chance feels absolutely amazing. [Sara Haro] I'm like, in shock, super excited, and can't wait to bring it on. [in French] It's an honor to have a second chance. I hope it works out. [spotter] Let's do this. We're going to roll the dice and see how it all shakes out. Get those cars ready. [female announcer] Drivers, report to head-to-head track. [Mike Hill] Alright. How about this for a plot twist? Five eliminated drivers have just been brought back from the dead, and they're now set to go head-to-head with a chance to win their way back into this competition. Listen, they were very disappointed, they thought they were going home, but now, as you just said, they're coming back. They've got to get focused, get back in gear, they've got to fix their cars, get back on the track, and get back in this competition. [Rut] It's tough to take desperation, and then get handed elation, and then turn that into motivation. That's a lot to go through, that range of emotions, and now we're about to see these five compete in a series of head-to-head battles. Winner gets back in the game. [MH] They've been ranked in the order they were knocked out of the competition, and our very first match-up features two drivers with very different styles and cars. [male announcer] One minute warning. Of course, we're talking about Alexandre Claudin and Faruk Kugay. That's the Frenchman in his 2500 lb widebody '68 Charger, taking on the pizza delivery man from San Francisco in his lightweight BMW drift car, which may give him a slight advantage on this track, Rut. [Rut] Could be, but that's why this head-to-head track is such a perfect battleground. It tests almost every Hyperdrive discipline in a lightning-fast sprint. It features precision targets, narrow shipping containers, tight barrel turns. This is going to be awesome. - [in French] Ready, my love? - [Julie] Yes, so ready. [spotter] Get it, bubba. [Faruk] Going into the head-to-head for the second time, I've learned that it's all about precision. If you make one mistake, you're done. Hopefully I can get through without making another mistake. [engine revs] [Mike Hill] An opportunity for new life is on the line. Who will seize the moment? Here we go. [Michael Bisping] Let's go! [tires squeal] [MH] Alexandre in the heavier car beats Faruk off the line, but Faruk is jumping ahead on the inside lane. Got to hit these targets coming up. - [tires squeal] - [bang] [bang] [MB] Both got it. [Rut] Yes. [MH] Coming up on the shipping containers next. Faruk's going to hit it first. [whoosh] [MH] Alexandre's slower in that wider car, but he's going to have the inside lane down the stretch. [Rut] Oh! Faruk with an epic drift. - [bang] - [MB] Wow! Beautiful. Whoa! [Rut] Look how close this is. [MH] Coming into the barrel turn, Faruk's got a slight lead. Alexandre's at a disadvantage with that big car. - [bang] - [hosts groan] [MH] But Faruk takes a penalty, and that's going to open the door for the Frenchman. [MB] Go! Faruk's across. Can Alexandre catch him in time? And he comes up just short of Faruk Kugay... [Rut] Wow! [MH] ...who's moving on to the next round of this Wildcard tournament. [Faruk] Sheldon, I love you. Thank you very much. Good job, dude. [MH] Man, if that run is any indication, we are in for a treat tonight. I had a little bit of a penalty, but our speed was enough to make up for that. Now we're moving to the next head-to-head battle. We are ecstatic. [MH] And for Alexandre, who turned heads in that one-of-a-kind Dodge Charger, it's the end of the line. So that penalty made it close, but Faruk Kugay moves on. He will face Sara Haro next. But before we get to that, we'll see Fielding Shredder and Jordan Martin. And listen, you can't have a wildcard without a wild child, and we got that in Fielding Shredder. He's aggressive, can be a little bit reckless, but he gets a second chance against Jordan Martin, the multi-millionaire, and of course that Lamborghini. [MB] Got to love Fielding Shredder, the way he drives is so much fun, and he went out with a bang, literally. But if you think he's going to slow down and play it safe, think again. He's going to give it everything he's got. [Rut] And amazingly, after that impact, the car itself was okay, he said the suspension was still straight, but it is a foot-and-a-half shorter now, because it's got no rear bumper, it's got no wing. That means he has to change those arcs, how he's going to slide into those turns to try to hit the targets, completely differently than he did before. And he knows that the best driving that Jordan has done was when he was in the head-to-head battle. So to me, I don't think this is an easy one to call, I think this could go either way. [engine revs, rattles] So ready for this. [spotter] Keep it tidy. [engine revs] Alright, here we go. [spotter] Good luck, Jordan. [spotter] Fielding, you got this. [engine revs] [MB] Let's go! [MH] Whoa! As expected, Jordan crushing Fielding on the straightaway. - [MB] Look at that go. - [MH] Coming to that first target. - [bang] - Jordan with a nice drift. - [ding] - [hosts] Oh! [MH] Fielding misses! What's going on? [MB] This is where Fielding will make up some time, though. [Rut] No fear through the container. [hosts] Oh! [MB] He's out of control. - [bang] - Wow! [MH] Fielding with a nice recovery. - [buzzer] - [MH] Jordan misses the target. It's all going to come down to this final barrel turn. [MB] Spin it, baby. [hosts] Oh! [MH] Oh my gosh, Fielding Shredder! [Rut] Reverse entry, and Jordan is in the K-rail. What is happening? [MH] Fielding Shredder, leaving Jordan in his dust, but those penalties could cost him. [engine roars] Jordan's still got a chance. [MB] Come on! [MH] Coming down the stretch, here he comes. [MB] Wow! That was the best thing I've ever seen in my life. [Rut] That was unbelievable. [MH] Fielding Shredder beats out Jordan Martin by a second. Yeah! [MB] We got to watch that again on instant replay. [Rut] Watching a driver who missed the first target go, "You know what? I got nothing to lose. I'm going to go full-throttle into a shipping container," and it literally launched him up, the car bounced once in the middle and then he launched out of it. [MH] I don't know if he meant to do it, but this might be the move of the tournament, going backwards into the barrel turn. [MB] Wow, look at that. [MH] But Jordan Martin misses the opportunity and goes crashing into a K-rail himself, and that would seal his fate here on Hyperdrive. That wasn't good. [Rut] Nothing but respect for this guy. He did what no one thought was possible, and got a Lambo to drift. My hat's off to him. Well done. [MH] Fielding Shredder is moving on to the final. Now he's got to refocus, because he's going to get the winner of this next upcoming Wildcard, Sara Haro, the Cinderella, against Faruk Kugay, who ended Alexandre Claudin's dreams. [Rut] And any way you slice it, Sara is a massive underdog here. Her stock V6 Mustang has less than half the horsepower of Faruk's BMW. but as we've seen on this head-to-head track, anything can happen. So for Faruk, he has to be flawless, and Sara has to do what she's done the whole time, which is go out there, give it your best, and you might be surprised, you might move on. You ready, Freddy? I'm ready. [spotter] Calm down, breathe, then get ready to launch. Woo. [Bun Bun] Remember to breathe. [Mike Hill] Let's go! [Rut] Sara's off to a slow start, ,looking a little gun-shy here. [MH] Get these targets. - [bump] - [Rut] There it goes. - [buzzer] - [MB] Oh! [MH] Sara missed a target, that's going to cost her. Going through the container, threading that needle. Sara's got to make up some time coming into that second turn. [Rut] Come on, Sara! [MH] Oh, but she overshoots it. [MB] Man. [buzzer] [MH] Faruk misses the target. [bleep] [MH] Sara's got a chance... - [buzzer] - ...but she misses the target! [MB] What is happening right now? [MH] Did Faruk just stall? Broke my car. [MB] Oh my word. [MH] Sara Haro misses two targets, overshoots a turn but she's still alive. [Bun Bun] You got it. Bring it. [MH] It is not midnight yet! - You did it. Good Job! - [MH] Oh my God. [Rut] I can't believe it. Faruk's car broke. - I think he... - [MB] He's blown it. [Rut] I think he got into that turn, I don't know if it was the axle, but that thing is toast. Wow. What, again? [MB] Look at the disbelief, the shock. Look at the denial, he's pissed. [MH] So another tough go for Faruk Kugay. My man's got all the talent in the world, but he just couldn't catch a break. It doesn't end. [MH] So that means Sara Haro is moving on to the final. The underdog does it again. She's going to be taking on Fielding Shredder, and fellas, it all comes down to this. One final race, a chance to return to the competition on the line. [Rut] And looking at his last race, Fielding's driving like he's playing with house money right now. That could come back to bite him if he doesn't clean it up. As always, Sara Haro is out-gunned in terms of horsepower, but if she can just make it across the line in one piece, she might just have a shot. I'm picking Fielding to win, but I really shouldn't. [MH] I don't know, Sara Haro, not only does she have those glass slippers on right now, but right now she might have a lucky rabbit's foot. [engine starts] Here we go. Let's get it. Let's keep it tidy. Woo! You got this. [engine starts] [engine revs] Here we go. [MH] It all comes down to this. Who will earn the golden ticket back into this competition? A chance to compete for the championship. Who wants it, baby? [engines roar] [spotter] Go! [MB] Let's go! [hosts] Whoa! [MB] Drifted all the way round. [Bun Bun] Keep it tight. Big penalty. We both missed it. [MB] Both spin out. Fielding is going to go full kamikaze through Thread the Needle. [Bun Bun] Go! [Rut] So does Sara. [MB] Wow! [MH] Sara didn't care either. [spotter] Watch your mirrors. [MH] Here they come, the next... Oh, and Sara! [Sara] Not again, no! [Rut] She overshoots the second turn again! - [bang] - [Rut] He got it. [MH] Fielding, one obstacle away from new life. Can Sara salvage this run? [Rut] Come on, Sara. [MH] Fielding, now in the barrel turn. [MB] There it is. Doing it perfectly. [Rut] Unbelievable, talk about redemption. [MH] Fielding Shredder, doing the impossible, driving his way back into this competition. Sara Haro comes up short, but the wild child from Texas is our Wildcard winner. [spotter] Hell, yeah! Good job. Very good job. That was awesome. [Fielding] Wildcard was absolutely wild, so I'm back now with the top eight. This is seriously like, from hero to zero, back to hero, I feel like for myself, so I couldn't be happier. Good job, Sara. Nice run. Thank you. [MH] So it's a final goodbye to young Sara Haro, who has every reason to hold her head high. As for Fielding Shredder, he made the most of his second opportunity, so he's back in the game. [MB] Even though he's only got essentially three quarters of a car, all the other drivers, I think they're all going to be a bit worried. [Rut] The rest of the field is not going to be happy to see a guy with this much talent get back in. This changes everything. We got eight exceptional drivers on Hyperdrive remaining, and it starts right now. [Brittany] Coming into this competition, I was nervous. I didn't know who I was competing against, what the track or the obstacles would look like. It scared me. I didn't expect to get so far, but now that I'm here and I've seen the competition, I'm gunning for the end at this point. I want to make it to the end. I am ready to destroy this track. [MH] With the championship just a few races away, the track designers are looking to send a message tonight. It's time for the contenders to rise to the occasion. We are calling this course the Gateway. [Rut] Seven obstacles in total, 11 targets, two entirely new challenges, and the Leveler has been unleashed. We've hidden a new counterweight on the monster, and she's going to swing more wildly than ever before. Just when they thought they had it dialed in, it's a brand-new puzzle for these drivers to solve. If you can make it through course, you deserve to advance to the final rounds. [MH] And Rut, to make matters worse, the racers will also be battling the elements, as we've got a slight drizzle now, which of course, could make for a wet track. [announcer] Track is hot. [MH] Our first driver tonight is Axel Francois, of course, along with his fiancée and spotter, Lise. Now we've seen this guy more than any other driver in this competition. Axel has driven in nine out of ten possible races so far, and there's no question his car is hurting because of it. This poor old Nissan with the BMW six-cylinder under the hood, it's tired. I think that engine is definitely on it's last leg, so it's a little down on power, but Mike, he's not going any softer. He's going as hard as he's ever gone. [MB] And that is why we love Axel. Every time, Axel pushes it to the limit. The car falling apart at the seams, it might even explode on this track, but I'll tell you something, I'll enjoy watching. [MH] Of course, his dreams haven't gone up in smoke, but that car certainly has, every time it's on the track. I can't breathe right now. [coughs] [Michael Bisping laughs] [in French] Okay, can you tell me the notes? One-hundred meters, right ninety and double target. Go with the angle. [MH] His spotter, Lise, with those precise directions as always. The big question, though. Can that car hold up? Axel Francois, let's go baby! [engine revs] [MH] Coming up on the first turn, two targets, a car length apart, this puppy is called Slideways. [two bangs] [crowd cheers] [MH] Drifted through those targets exactly the way it's supposed to be done. [in French] Perfect! [Rut] These early obstacles are going to test Axel's car. Every time he pops that clutch, every time he kicks the throttle, he's trying to push it to the limit without blowing that engine. [MH] He pulls up to Roundhouse next. [Lise in French] Okay, stop there. [MH] He's got to perform a series of 360s around those pylons. And you've got a couple of targets you have to hit in there as well. [in French] Okay, let's go. [MH] Here he goes, into that first 360. [Rut] It's so important for drivers to get as close to these pylons as possible, and link them together, one spin to the next. [MH] Now he's got to hit the target. No! He missed it. [in French] You didn't get it, go back, Axel. [MB] This is costing time. - [bang] - [MH] Yes. [Rut] He is an instructor at his own drift school in France, and this is the kind of thing they teach. You see that nice tight circle? And he has the confidence to throw the car into that turn as close as he wants to that light pole. [MB] And he is getting so close, but that is by design, not by accident. - [bang] - [MH] And bam! Nice. [in French] Leave, left 90, left 90 again to the acceleration zone. [MH] Coming out of Roundhouse, no penalties, but a little time lost at that first target as he heads over to Forced Perspective. Drivers now have just two inches of clearance on either side. Axel Francois is not slowing down, hitting it with speed! [MB] And he nailed it. [crowd cheers] [Rut] Great job through Forced Perspective. [MH] Axel now moving on to the re-calibrated Leveler. Now the balance point has changed, so it's gonna swing more wildly than ever before. And for Axel, who struggled on this obstacle here in the Knockout Rounds, communication with Lise will be key. Woo! Okay, here we go. [Axel in French] Tell me when it's catching speed. It's catching speed, Axel. [Rut] This is another obstacle where his engine is going to be put through the wringer. The way you have to stop and start your car, the quick changes in direction, you can already see the smoke start pouring out of his hood. [Lise in French] One meter. [Rut] Stalled it. [Lise in Frecnh] Go up. [Michael Bisping] Ah. [Rut] That engine is struggling. It's on its last legs. [in French] Now, at your tail. It's good. [Rut] A lot of pressure on him as the first driver trying to negotiate this new counterweight. Got to try to offset that. [MH] Let's see if they can adjust. [Lise in French] At your tail. [MH] Got to go up a little bit further. [MB] Yeah, that's right, go forward. [in French] Go up. [MH] Under 30 seconds left now. [Lise in French] Go up. Stop right there. [in French] I hate this thing. [Lise in French] Go down. - Back. - Not back. - Rut, not back! - Not that far back. I said "not back." [Rut] You were right. - Thank you, finally. - I was wrong. [MH] Fellas, it's a whole new ball game at the Leveler tonight. [crowd groans] [MB] Max time. [in French] Go back up. It's all good, Axel. [MB] Messed that up, Axel. [in French] It's going to be left fast, right 90. On the right, 110 meters then slalom. It's nothing, Axel. Focus on what's next. [Rut] He needs to have the drive of his life right here. Wide open, Axel. Send it, buddy. [MH] The extreme drift instructor. Headed for the Gauntlet next. Three swinging targets, preceded by a slalom to throw off his timing. This is going to be a tough one. - [MB] Here we go. - [bang] - [MH] That's one. - [bang] - [MB] Two... - [bang] [MH] Made it! [MH] Yes! [in French] Good. [MB] He really had to chase down that third target, because it was swinging out the way, but he was not gonna admit defeat. [Lise in French] Left 90 again, on the doughnut, then four targets. [MH] Axel needs to nail Target Zone to keep this run competitive, so much on the line here. How much can that car take? [MB] Easy. [two bangs] [MH] He got it. Spin it. Spin it. There it is. [MB] So good at this. [Rut] Unbelievable. [in French] Turn around at the tube, then go on the rail. [MH] Now it's a choice between Rail Slide or the long way through Walk on Water. [Lise] Alright, the rail. [Rut] With all the issues he's had at Walk on Water, this might be the safer play. - [bump] - [hosts] Oh! - [Axel in French] I went hard on it. - It's okay. 100 meters, break right ahead. [tires squeal] [Lise] 150 meters. [Rut] This is insane. What a lap! Even with that penalty, for the Leveler, he is flying in this old car! [MB] That car will blow up. [Lise] 300 meters, fast. [MH] Coming around that last bend. He's our first racer of the night. Axel Francois! Smoking. [crowd cheers] [MH] A solid run by the Frenchman, despite that penalty at the Leveler, but... you can see right there by the look on his face that he ain't too pleased about it. That's Axel Francois trying to keep himself out of the bottom two, and out of the head-to-head. [Axel in French] [Bleep] the Leveler! I'm so tired. I stalled, right when I was about to get it. [MH] Oh my God. [Rut] He's experiencing a very real condition we would call, "oil blow-by," because the rings are so angry, and they are trying to give up. That's very real, there. [MH] Axel had better hope he doesn't have to drag that car into that head-to-head later tonight. Seven drivers still to run. The goal, stay out of the bottom two, and put yourself one step away from the championship. [announcer] Track is hot. Prepare for launch. [engine starts] [engine revs] [MH] With a shot at the trophy on the horizon, the Hyperdrive track designers were determined to force the cream to rise to the top. [engine revs] [Ken in Japanese] Here we go! Let's roll up our sleeves! [MH] Atsushi... ...Brittany... [Kevin] You got this. This is all you. [MH] ...Alex and Corinna... ...loaded into the launcher, hellbent on keeping their championship dreams alive, and surviving the most brutal course yet, [hosts] Whoa! [Michael Bisping] Go, baby! [MH] But they soon learned, success will be hard to come by in Knockout Four. - [buzzer] - [MB] Just missed it. [bang] [buzzer] Ah, son of a monkey. [MB] Here we go. - [buzzer] - [crowd groans] [Rut] Seven obstacles tonight. This course is not for the faint of heart. [whoosh] [buzzer] Let's go! - [buzzer] - [crowd groans] [MB] Five seconds. [MH] Not a single racer approached the Leveler penalty-free, so steadying the swaying bridge would be paramount if they were to separate themselves from the pack. [in Japanese] I will leave it to you, Ken. Back up! [Jacqueline in German] Stop. Don't move. - [Kevin] Hold on. - I can feel it. [in German] You have to come back a little. Stop. Is it too far? A little farther forward! Jacqueline, I see that! [MH] The new counterweight on the six-story monster gave the drivers fits. [Kevin] There you go, forward. Dang it! So close. [Rut] These seconds are clicking by so fast. [MB] Back a bit! Ah! [MH] Even Corinna Graff, who had solved the Leveler in every single race... - [in German] Where should I move? - Down. Backwards. [MH] ...couldn't find that elusive balance point, no matter how she tried. - [buzzer] - [crowd groans] [in German] This is [bleep]! The Leveler was one of my favorite obstacles the last few races... [in German] It's swinging now. ...but today the balance is completely different. Sorry, Benny. [MH] The clock expired on all four racers... - [buzzer] - [crowd groans] ...ballooning their run times. That went by real quick. [Rut] With this new balance point, I'm not sure if anyone's going to solve this thing tonight. [MH] They made a furious push to the finish... Bam! Bam! - [bang] - [MH] There's one... - [bang] - two, three... [Rut] There we go, Corinna. [MH] ...desperate to stay out of the bottom two. [MB] Atsushi! [MH] And after the dust settled, Atsushi and Corinna breathed easier, safe from the hea-to-head. [yells in triumph] [Ken, in Japanese] Nice! You did it! [MH] While Brittany and Alex found themselves in the danger zone... [MB] Come on! [MH] ...owning the two slowest times posted to the board. [Rut] That run drops Brittany into last place, with only three drivers to go. [Kevin] That Leveler got the best of us this time, babe. You were going too far back. [MB] The old backseat driver. I bet she'll love that. Kevin is daring. [MH] Five racers down, and look at how those penalties are stacking up. This course is eating people alive right now, but we do have some big guns getting ready to hit the track. [announcer] Track is hot. Prepare for launch. [MH] Without a clean run on the board, Diego Higa and João Barion pulled to the line, eager to prove they could conquer the Knockout Four track. [Rut] If it looks like half a car, it's because the whole front half of the car is now gone. [MH] And unfortunately for the Sheriff, his last run had left his vintage Mustang with battle scars he couldn't hide. [Rut] This is more than cosmetic. He's going to be fighting this car his entire run. [engine revs] [João in Portuguese] My car isn't 100%. It has a lot of problems, principally with its steering and alignment. [Nando] It's going to be fine, dude. Stay calm. [MH] Here we go. [Michael Bisping] Go! Wow! [MH] The Sheriff showed early he was prepared to wrestle his car - through the track... - [Rut] Keep in mind that car is a couple feet shorter on the front. - [two bangs] - [MH] Got them both. [Rut] No problem there. [MH] Coming up on those first two targets. [bang] [buzzer] [hosts groan] [MB] He missed a target! [MH] ...while a mistake at Slideways had Bis wondering if the course would bring Diego back down to earth. [MB] He hasn't faced much adversity. Can the youngster shake off that early time penalty here? [MH] The baby-faced assassin stepped up to the challenge at Roundhouse... - [bang] - [MH] That's one. [bang] [MH] Outstanding job by Diego Higa. ...and João pushed his wounded car to its limits. [bang] [Rut] Oh! [MB] Wow! [MH] Oh yeah, baby. [Rut] Even with half the car removed, this thing still looks insane going around the track. [bang] Well done. Get out of there, bro. [MH] When the Brazilians arrived at the Leveler, they were neck-and-neck. [Rut] Not a single racer has solved this thing tonight. [Nando in Portuguese] Go back. Calm down. Let it start to fall. - [hosts] Oh! - [MB] Forward! - Oh, come on! - [MH] Balance out! [in Portuguese] Stay calm. That's it, that ain't moving nowhere. [MH] That's when Diego made the designer's new challenge look like child's play. ...eight, nine, ten! He got it! Yes! [MB] Wow! [Rut] Is there anything this kid can't do? He just vaulted himself to the front of the pack. [Nando] Stop, stay there! [MH] But João Barion wouldn't be outdone. - [Rut] He got it! - [crowd cheers] This guy's unbelievable. The Brazilians are getting it done here in Knockout 4. [MH] And still it was anybody's race. On his way to the gauntlet. [in Portuguese] I think the supercharger fan belt popped again. [Rut] He's been fighting that car all race. Can João hold on? [Nando in Portuguese] Stay straight, João! - [bang][ - [MB] Got it. - [buzzer] - [Rut] Missed it. - [crowd groans] - [MB] Missed the third one! [Rut] He missed both of those. [MH] Oh my word. [MB] That's going to cost him big time. [Rut] Oh! He's going the wrong way. [MB] No! He's got to go back. [in Portuguese] Where did you go? Get back! - [MH] You've got to go back! - [MB] Go back! [João] During the race, I really lost my concentration, because of all the problems I was having with the steering wheel. [MB] Wow! [MH] João's wrong turn opened the door for his rivals. Diego Higa, coming down the back stretch! Taking on the hardest course yet, and laying one down. [crowd cheers] [MH] And in an effort to make up the time he'd lost, the Sheriff continued to tempt fate. [crowd shouts in excitement] [Mike Hill] João Barion... flies across the finish line. 6:34... but that's still a full 18 seconds off of Diego's pace. That'll be good enough to put him into third place. [João in Portuguese] I had problems with my car from the start. Problems with the engine leaking oil, overheating the engine. Several problems altogether. - [crunch] - [crowd] Oh! [MB] Oh my God! Oh, man! [João] No, my car is broke. I cannot go. [Rut] That right front suspension has given up. [MB] No way. Trying to keep up with the baby-faced assassin has come at a cost. [in Portuguese] I don't know what I'll do from here on, if I'll be able to repair it or not. [MH] So Diego Higa back in familiar territory, taking over the top spot here at Knockout Four, and with only one racer to go. Brittany Williams now knows she'll be in that head-to-head elimination race. Only question right now is, will she'll be taking on Alex Graff or the wild child, Fielding Shredder, who's our final racer of the night? [announcer] Track is hot. Driver eight, report to the start line. Back in it. [MH] Alright, here comes Fielding Shredder and what's left of his car. Of course, he kept his Hyperdrive hopes alive by winning the Wildcard, but now he's got to race for a third time tonight, and we know he's been one of the most entertaining drivers in this competition. My man rolls the dice every time he gets behind the wheel, and although the final results have been inconsistent for the rally instructor from Texas, you just know he's about to put on a show. The car looks fantastic. Does the trunk look like it's going to hang on? [spotter] I don't know. [laughs] Oh my God. Just be you, Fielding Shredder. Let's send it down to Lindsay. Michael, Fielding, I know he's so pumped to be back in this competition, but he told me that he's actually going to dial it back. How is that going to play out? What's that going to look like? He's going to try to dial it back, but knowing Fielding, I mean, he's Mr. Checkers or Wreckers, so he's either going to get first place, or go down in a spectacular fashion as we've already seen. So hopefully he's Mr. Checkers today and keeps it together. - [bang] - Whoa! Jeez! [crowd cheers] [Lindsay] Alright, he's ready. [Fiedling] This course has a ton of new elements I've never tried. I've never done Forced Perspective, I've never been down the grind rail, so I need to watch out for myself, and just... not break anything, not smash anything, and try to make it to the end. [MH] Well, Fielding's got to beat Alex Graff's time to avoid going into that head-to-head. Put his car into a wall in Knockout Two, earned himself a new lease of life as our Wildcard winner... [crowd cheers] ...said he'd be dialing it back, but I'm just going to believe that when I see it. Woo-hoo! [hosts yell in excitement] [engine roars] [MH] He only knows one way. He only knows one way! Fielding Shredder! [bang] [crowd cheers] [MH] Smashed into one of those targets, but failed to hit the other. Woo-hoo! [MB] He's going to take it easy, for sure! - Nailed it. - [laughs] [Rut] One thing he does have to factor in: Because that rear bumper is gone, the car is considerably shorter, so he'll have to approach the targets a lot differently than he did before. [MH] He's lost a front bumper, he's lost a back bumper, he's lost the back of his car. [MB] My word. Back in the saddle, baby. He said, "I'm going to take it easy." Okay, buddy. Okay, you keep telling yourself that. [MH] That ten-second penalty already has him behind Alex Graff's pace, going into Roundhouse. [Rut] Oh my gosh. He is going to "Fielding Shred" this thing. [MH] Alex made it through here clean. Ooh, yeah! [MH] These targets are going to be critical. Here we go. - [bang] - [MH] Boom, baby! - [crowd cheers] - [MB] Yeah, buddy. That was a little wide. [spotter] Looking great. [MH] Losing a little time on that wide turn there, though, got to keep it under control. Easy. [MH] Fielding Shredder, trying to stay out of the bottom two, spinning that beat-up car around this track. [Rut] He's got to get this target. [MB] Come on. - [hosts] Whoa! - [bang] [MH] Yeah! Go ahead. Nailed it. Good Job. [tires squeal] [hosts] Whoa! [Rut] Nice, Fielding. - [MB] Oh God. - [crowd groans] [MH] Whoa! [bang] Might as well do it, right? Might as well. You lost your tail light. [laughs] [Jordan] He's clinically insane. It's Fielding. [laughs] [Rut] Heading into Forced Perspective. This is his very first time attempting this obstacle. [MB] Come on. Let's go. [engine roars] [MH] Heading through, let's see if he gets clear. - [buzzer] - [MB] Oh! [MH] Five seconds for a penalty. To be fair, I thought he would've just smashed all of them on purpose. Well, half the car's hanging off the back, it's way harder to get through now. [MH] That's two penalties through three obstacles now, as he heads for the Leveler, dropping farther behind Alex Graff's pace. So if he can't clean things up here, Fielding is in jeopardy of falling out of this competition just as quickly as he got back in it. [Rut] He cannot afford max time here. [Fielding] Talk to me, Goose. Should I go forward more? Yeah, forward slightly. Come back. Keep coming. [MB] They must be patient. It takes a while for it to start moving. Stop. Forward. [MB] Forward, of course. Stop there, Come back. It's looser this time. Come back slow. - [MB] No, stay there. - [spotter] Stop there. Stop. A little farther forward. The balance point's a little bit in front of where it was. Just hold it there. A little more forward. [MH] Man, that counterweight continues to frustrate his efforts. [spotter] Wait there for a second. Come back slightly. There, stop. [MB] Right there. [spotter] Wait, it may oscillate back a bit. We don't want it going too far. Never mind, you've got to back up. [MB] Good advice. - Look at the wheels. - [Rut] Spinning tires in reverse? Come on, give me a break, man. [spotter] There you go, now wait. That's the spot, right here. - [onlooker] Come on, Fielding! - [MB] That's it come on, buddy. [hosts groan] [MB] God. [crowd groans] - [buzzer] - [Rut] Max time. Max time. Just go forward. [MH] 90 seconds is up, so Fielding has put himself in real jeopardy here, with just three obstacles remaining. [MB] He ain't smiling now. [spotter] Go! [MH] Alex Graff nailed the back half of this course. Fielding's going to have to be picture-perfect now. [MB] Come on, baby. [tires squeal] [MH] Into the Slalom and then the Gauntlet. [tires squeal] [spotter] You're good, get it through there. [MH] Here we go. [bang] - [bang] - [MH] Bam. - [bang] - [MB] Whoa! - [crowd cheers] - [MB] Yes! [MH] Fielding Shredder, perfect through the Gauntlet. Three for three on those targets. Racing against the clock as he heads to Target Zone now. Crushed them. [Rut] This run's going to come down to whether or not he can pick up these next targets clean. If he misses here, Fielding could be dead in the water. Four targets, then back to the 180. - [tires squeal] - [bang] [MB] That's it. - [tires squeal] - [bang] - [two bangs] - [crowd cheers] That's four, get out. [Rut] Look at that. He got it with that spoiler that's hanging off. Now 180 around the pole. [MH] Under a minute to make it home, he is headed for that Rail Slide. [Rut] He's never done this. Here we go! [thump] [Fielding] Woo-hoo! [crowd cheers] Great job! That looked awesome. [MH] He's got a great chance not to be in that bottom two and avoid the head-to-head. Let's see if he can bring it home solidly. [Rut] Hard as you can, Fielding. [MH] You know he's going to bring it as hard as he can. That's what he does. [MB] Oh yeah. [MH] Mr. Excitement. [MB] Come on, buddy. [MH] Fielding Shredder, trying to bring it home. - Trying to avoid being in the bottom two. - [MB] Come on! Let's go! [MH] Coming down the final stretch. Five seconds to bring it home. Can he do it? - Yes! - [MB] Wow! - [laughs] - [crowd cheers] [Rut] Fielding crosses the line, beating out Alex by less than a second, and avoids another head-to-head race. [spotter] That was awesome! Good job, dude. - [MH] Holy crap. - [MB] I can't take it. I'm going to have a heart attack. [MH] The Wild Child advances to the next round by the skin of his teeth, and I think I can speak for everybody when I say I'm so happy to have him back. Is the car... destroyed yet? [spotter] No, I don't think it can be any more destroyed. Oh, copy. So, it's good. [spotter] Yeah. [MH] Alright, so six drivers have risen to the occasion, and are through safely on this gateway track. It's now time to find out who will be joining them in the next round. - Look good? - Yep. [talking in German] [MH] It's time for another head-to-head and you know the situation. One's got to go home, one will continue in this competition, and we got two drivers that we've come to know and love, that is, in Brittany Williams and the old school drifter, Alex Graff. Brittany's really proud of how far she's made it, and she doesn't want to go home without a fight. That said, she does realize that she has less experience than Alex. Alex, of course, one of the oldest guys in the competition, been doing this for years, and he feels that he's in the better car as well. In fact, he said he wouldn't sell it for $60,000, not even to Rutledge Wood. I wouldn't pay that much for it, but I did try and buy it off-camera. This seems like a battle of horsepower, but honestly it's really about the battle of perfection: Who's not going to make a mistake? [Brittany] Alex Graff is a phenomenal driver. It makes it more nerve-racking, but his car is kind of the closest to mine, as far as power goes. So hopefully, it goes my way. I'm going to give it my best. [Kevin] Don't look at the bright yellow BMW. You look at your lane. Don't worry about him. [Alex, in German] Today I go head-to-head. Of course, it's not so easy for me. It's a lot of pressure. One mistake and you're out... but that's racing here, that's the challenge here, and I will race for the top. For me there is only number one. I don't want to go home. Are you a little nervous? Of course I'm nervous. [engine revs] [engines rev] Here we go. You got it, baby. Get it. [in German] You got this. [MH] Here we go. Alex got a slight lead right here on the inside lane. [MB] It's going to be accentuated round this bend, of course. [Brittany] Ah! [bleep] [MH] Hold it. Brittany missed it? [MB] Wow! [MH] Blew through that container. [Rut] Brittany falling behind. She'll have the inside lane on the second target. [bang] [MH] Alex nails it. Don't miss this one. - [bang] - [MH] Oh, and Brittany's got it too. [Kevin] You got it, go! [Rut] She's still got a chance, - it'll come down to the barrel turn. - [MH] Alex with the lead, but Brittany's not letting up. - [MB] Come on! - [Brittany] [bleep] [Rut] Here we go for the win. [MB] Oh, so close. Go! [MH] Old school, with new life in this competition. [Rut] Whoa! [crowd cheers] [MB] Wow. Wow! [in German] Good job! [Rut] Boy, that is two drivers putting it all on the line, We've really seen the best out of these drivers in the head-to-head competition, because it really puts it all on that boilerplate. [clapping, cheering] [Brittany sighs] It's okay, baby. Good job... I love you, honey. [sighs] [bleep] That was close. I lost, but he deserved that win. He did an absolute perfect lap. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I never expected to make it past the first round, and to know that I put down some really solid laps, and I was able to prove myself, not just to everyone else, but also to me. Standing here is probably one of the greatest moments of my entire life. It's been a wild ride. I did... way better than I thought I could. I loved it, every minute of it.
