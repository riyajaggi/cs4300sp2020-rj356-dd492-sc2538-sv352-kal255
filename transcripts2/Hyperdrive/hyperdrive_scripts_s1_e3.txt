 [spotter, over radio] Down to Walk on Water, be careful. Keep it tidy. [Rutledge Wood] Alright, here we go. It's all on the line here. [Mike Hill] Fielding Shredder headed to Walk on Water. Now here's something for you. He's covered his intake with a trash can to waterproof his engine. [Rut] No guarantee this works. He's still got to be smart about the way he approaches this. [MH] Oh! [Rut] He brought way too much speed into that turn.

 [Michael Bisping] Oh, he spun. Oh, man. [Rut] We'll see if that trash can works. [MH] Remember, this obstacle almost ended his competition last race. [Rut] Wipers on. Oh, she's cooking now, baby. [MH] So far so good. [Rutledge] He is attacking this, putting a ton of faith in a two dollar piece of plastic. [splash] [MH] And he's through the water. Careful on the target, careful. - Here he goes. - [bang] [yells, cheers] Ain't worried about that.

 [MH] And he passes. Very good job. [MH] He's done it! No water damage. That engine purring like a kitten. Fielding Shredder with a simple but ingenious fix to slay his nemesis from Qualifier One. [MB] Nice adjustment. [tires squeal] [MH] Sliding into the checkpoint. He's right on Axel Francois' heels. He's got to beat his time to advance to the Knockout Rounds. Did I flat spot them? Maybe a little bit. You're good. [Rut] This guy is so much fun to watch, such a wild man, but can he rein it in and deliver a clean run on the back half of the course? [engine idles] [engine revs] I stalled it! - [boom] - [hosts yell] [MH] Stalled his car, the cannon fires, he's going to lose some time here. [Rut] He'll avoid the impact, but he's still gotta drive through a flood here. [splashing] [hosts] Whoa! [spotter] Watch it right there. - [MB] Oh! - [Rut] It is slick. [Mike Hill] My man, Fielding Shredder. - Nice job. - [MB] There you go, nice. [Rut] Beautifully done. [spotter] Into the Leveler, stop at the light. [tires squeal] Okay. Woo! A little foggy. Alright, wait for the light. [MH] Stalling at the Water Cannon has put him eight seconds behind a qualifying pace. [Rut] His back is up against the wall here. He's got to push it farther than Axel's nine feet to the edge if he wants any chance of cracking the top three. [MB] This has to be perfect. [spotter] Go! Stop at the first light. [ramp rattles] - [Rut] Oh! - [MB] Too much! [hosts yell in excitement] [Rut] Oh my God! Six feet! He almost missed the end of the ramp, he was going so hard up there. I kind of want to see a car go off the end of the Leveler. You don't wanna see a car go off the end of the Leveler. Not with him in it. [splashing] [MH] Here we go. [Rut] He definitely brought down the Leveler faster than Axel, but was it enough to make up the eight seconds he needs to crack the top three? Oh! Whoa. [MH] Fielding Shredder with a chance to get into the top three. [MB] Come on! [engine revs] [Rut] He's flying. [spotter] Fast right to finish. - [tires squeal] - [MH] One last turn. Can he do it? [Rut] Look at that drift. [MB] That is beautiful. [engine revs] Whoa! [MH] Here he comes! [Fielding laughs] - [Rut] Wow! - [MH] He did it. [MH] Second place. [MB] Second place. Woo-hoo! Nice job. [Rutledge] 509.8 for Fielding Shredder. - Unreal. - Wow! [Fielding] Do I still have a bumper? You still have bumpers. You're good. [Fielding] Alright. That's a win. That's a win for me. [Rut] Who knew a trip to the grocery store to buy floor mats, a trash can, and a water bottle could mean so much that he could put down that kind of a lap? - That's the best $20 he ever spent. - Amen. [Michael Bisping] Let's remember, second place with a few mistakes, you know, he overshot a few corners, he spun round a few times, he had to go back and correct himself and still got second place. That was nuts. [MH] Alright, our final results are in and unfortunately we have to say goodbye to Mike Martin, Brent Pursifull and Mark Rios. But for Japan's Atsushi Taniguchi, as well as Fielding Shredder, and Sara Haro from the USA, They'll be moving directly to the Knockout Rounds, where half of the field has now been locked in, in the quest for the Hyperdrive Championship. Tonight's middle six finishers will need to get their cars fueled up and ready to go, as they're about to meet six new drivers. Qualifier race number three begins right now. [Mike Hill] Alright, time to strap back in, because twelve hungry drivers are about to fire up their engines. But everything's about to change, because as always, there's a brand new course for the drivers to contend with. That's right and this track is all about speed, pure, unadulterated speed. And while precision challenges remain, if your car is designed to go hammer-down, straight-line fast, this may be your best chance to qualify. The track is stacked with blistering straightaways, and at our newest marquis obstacle, Forced Perspective, racers must roar down a 1,000 foot stretch that shrinks to a claustrophobic gap only six inches wider than each car. Who'll have the guts to keep their foot on the gas with the walls closing in? The clock is ticking, and the way this course keeps evolving, the time to qualify for the Knockout Rounds is right now. [female announcer] Track is hot. Driver one, prepare for launch. [Mike Hill] Alright, here we go. First up, we have the youngest driver in the competition. But would you believe me If I told you he might just be the favorite to win it all? He's only 21 years old. His name is Diego Higa, and he's from Brazil. You've got to see this kid drive. They call him the baby-faced assassin, he's already making quite the impression here at Hyperdrive. The other competitors said they've been a little bit intimidated by what they've seen. [engine revs] [in French] Diego is very fast. He's very scary. [engine revs] [competitor 1] He's like The Terminator. Diego's a machine. That man is an animal. [engine revs] [competitor 2] I saw his set-up on his Mustang, and I knew for a fact that these guys were here. They meant business. Diego, to me, is the Goliath. [engine revs] [Diego, in Portuguese] Many people look at me and say this guy is just a boy. Just some kid. They're not able to understand, I'm chasing my dream. My name is Diego Higa, I'm from Santos, Brazil, and I drift because of my dad. My dad was one of the original drifters, here in Brazil. I always used to ride next to him, in the passenger seat. One day he pulled the car over and said, "It's time to focus on you and your career. Let's turn you into a champion." My first time driving a real car, it was... a dream come to life. That's when I decided that's what I wanted. I began competing when I was 14 years old. Today I am the three-time Super Drift Champion in Brazil. [engines revving] I don't leave the house for a competition, unless its to win. My father and I have a very strong bond. Passion for cars, passion for drift, It's what unites us. It could be a go-kart race, it could be a bike race, a game of cards. My father taught me... it's all about winning. [crowd yells] [Mike Hill] Diego Higa, ready to make his Hyperdrive debut. - [in Portuguese] Good luck, you hear? - Thank you. [MH] That's his father, Neto, dialing him in there. Rut, these two have spent years together designing this car. [Rut] That's right. Diego's driving a supercharged 2006 Mustang V8 that's built to drift. 600 horsepower, so it's not the fastest car here. So he has to make sure he's on point in the precision elements. Let's see if he can live up to the hype. [engine idles] [Diego in Portuguese] This is crazy. Prepare yourself. - [engine revs] - [crowd yells] [tires squeal] [hosts shout in excitement] Let's go! [Michael Bisping] Wow! Listen to that! - [engine roars] - [MH] Screaming off the line, headed toward the first of our signature Hyperdrive targets. Now he's got to hit this with the backside of his car. - [thud] - [Rut] Wow! [cheering] Textbook. Grabs that big handbrake and cuts the wheel, which sends him into that glorious drift. [MH] Child's play for the child. [in Portuguese] Nice! Turn coming up on your left. [MH] Next up is a straight shot through the Fast Lane. Hey, this is like the Hyperdrive 40-yard dash. - [engine roars] - [MH laughs in excitement] [MH] Over 100 miles an hour! - Wow! - [crowd cheers] [MH] Flexing his muscle right there. Now he's onto a new obstacle. [Neto, in Portuguese] Let's go! [MH] Diego Higa makes it to the first checkpoint and the clock stops right here. 120.9. - [in Portuguese] Go, Brazil! - [cheers] [MH] Now we're about to see something we haven't seen yet. Forced Perspective. Two rows of shipping containers that narrow to an opening with only three inches of clearance on either side of the driver's car. Diego will have to squeeze through that tiny gap without clipping the Break Wall. If he does, each layer he hits is a five-second penalty. [in Portuguese] Accelerate where possible. Yep. [MH] He's got the green light. Let's go. Go! [announcer] 300 to Break Wall. 200. [MH] He's rolling through that Forced Perspective, and... - [engine revs] - ...got through! Wow! [MB] Perfect! [MH] Wow. Unscathed. [in Portuguese] Nice! Go to your left. [Rut] Unbelievable. That was fourth gear, flawless through there. [MB] What's going through the minds of the other drivers, knowing that he had the big reputation, that he was the favorite, and now living up to that reputation? [Rut] That just sent such a message. [MH] This is what they expected. Diego Higa, now at the Leveler [in Portuguese] Dude, the handbrake is finished. We'll fix it afterwards. Let's go. Imagine if it doesn't stop. No, it will stop. Stay calm. [MH] Uh-oh. Diego warning his dad his handbrake doesn't feel right, but... clearly, Neto has faith in his car and of course, his son. Obviously a great relationship these two have. Lots of trust both ways. [Neto in Portuguese] Let's go. [MH] He's on! [MB] Come on. [Rut] Is he going to slow down? [hosts yell in excitement] [crowd cheers] [MB] Just six feet from the edge. No fear. [Rut] Guys, this is his first time seeing the Leveler and he just charged it with no hesitation. [MH] 21 years old and brimming with confidence. Young Diego Higa with an incredible run so far. [in Portuguese] Man, there's an absurd brake smell. Go forward a little bit. [MH] But he's still very concerned about that handbrake. [engine revs] [bump] [engine revs] God, you can hear him from over here. That's insane. [MH] Next it's Target Zone. How's he gonna handle it, Rut? [Rut] If his handbrake is broken, Diego's going to have to switch up his style to hit these targets. He'll have to clutch-kick it. That's throttle down, pop the clutch to get his car into a drift. We'll see what type of driver he really is right here. [engine revs] - [in Portuguese] Oh damn, it's here! - [Neto] Stop! [Mike Hill] Whoa! Overcooking the turn to Target Zone, his first big mistake. And he misses the target! - [in Portuguese] The handbrake is done. - [MB] He's got no handbrake! [Rut] Oh, it's toast. It's all throttle now. [bang] - [MH] Diego Higa! - [crowd cheers] [Rut] That is an absolutely incredible adjustment on the fly. [MH] Now it's just a sprint to the Finish Line. All the other drivers said they were intimidated. The favorite for this competition, and we see why! - [cheering] - What a run by Diego Higa. A blistering 3:24 in his Hyperdrive debut. An incredible run by the 21 year-old. Oh my goodness. [cheering] [Neto in Portuguese] Well done. [Michael Bisping] Wow. He just sent a big message. Guys, I'm not gonna lie. I was terrified when he came underneath here. The sound of that, the drifting, the movement. I thought if he messes up in that car, we're done for, but the guy's an artist. [cheering] [Lindsay Czarniak] Diego, I see that smile. What kind of statement do you think that you made? [in Portuguese] For me, I could have done a lot better. What did you think, Neto, on your son's run? [in Portuguese] We were talking the whole time. We had good communication. So I feel good. It's going to get a lot better, and even faster. We race 24/7. This is our life. That is what we do. [Neto laughs] Congratulations. Great run. [announcer] Driver two, report to the start line. [MH] A whole lot of racing still to come, but that run felt like it might be a lock for the top three. And we already know what's on the line here tonight. Tonight's top three finishers will be moving on to the Knockout Rounds. The middle six will survive and have one last chance in Qualifier Four, and of course, the slowest three will be eliminated. [announcer] Driver two, prepare for launch. [MH] After Diego's brilliant debut, the next wave of drivers featured three of the fastest quarter-mile cars in the competition, all hoping they'd arrived on the right track at the right time. Speed specialists on a speed course with qualifying times in their sights. First into the blocks was Mick Wilkes from Birmingham, England, driving his one-of-a-kind 1978 Vauxhall Bedford van. Everybody knows me as Wacky Mick, because of me attitude, I'm permanently messing around. You'll have to cut that bit, because somebody forgot the keys! I don't work on cars to make a fortune. I'm not a good businessman as such. I do it for the love of doing cars. [shutter rattles] I race the van because it's different. It's just the chance of doing something totally stupid or totally crazy. The van originally had got 56 horsepower, I think. It's now got like, ten times that horsepower. [engine revs] Out of the corners it just accelerates like a scalded cat. [meow] [MH] The Englishman was eager to prove his lightweight, 600-horsepower van - was no joke. - [crowd chants] Whacky! - Remember what you've got to do. - [laughs] [MH] The van's a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'. "Mick Wilkes Wacky," they call him. - [crowd cheers] - [engine revs] [engine revs] - Let's go. - [cheering] Yeah, boy! - [Rut] Did you see that? - [MH laughs] [MH] God bless the Queen. [MB] God bless the Queen, indeed. [Rut] That thing is a rocket ship. This is the greatest thing I've ever seen. [MH] Got to hit this target with the back half of his car. - [buzzer goes] - [MB] Oh! Come on, Mick. [MH] He hit it with the front, that's a penalty. Back, back up! - [crash] - [crowd cheers] [Rut] I don't know why he'd go back if he already got the penalty, but okay. Just smash that to bits. Who cares? [Rut] This guy is so rock and roll. Smooth, don't forget. [chuckles] Okay. [MH] The former dragster looked to make up time and showcase his van's ridiculous speed through Fast Lane. [Rut] So much power in there. That thing moves. [MH] But he lost his way at the exit. Oh, Wacky! Where are you going, Wacky? [Rut] Oh no, he's supposed to be on the other side of that rail. [Mick swears] What you doing? [Mick] Get me back, Deb! [MH] Looking for that Forced Perspective. He's already got a forced perspective. [MH] After managing to navigate his way through the next obstacle... [MB] Come on, Mick. There we go. [cheering] [MB] ...he veered off course again. [Rut] Hard turn left, buddy. [MB] Where's he going? [MH] He missed it. [MB] He's making up his own course. He doesn't care. He doesn't play by the rules. Which way? [Deb] What you doing? [Mick] Gone the wrong way. You've got to pay attention to the track! [Mick swears] [MH] In the end it became painfully clear, the only thing Mick Wilkes would find was the bottom of the leader board. [Rut] He's got a hard right turn coming up here into the Target Zone. - Oh my God! - [crowd screams] [MH] He missed it. [Rut] He's got to go back. [MB] Mick, go back! - Go back! Spin a U-turn! - Mick [bleep] [MB] Go back! Ah, buggered it now. [Rut] That was awesome. [MH] Like Mick Wilkes, driver number three had a machine built for speed. Saul Valencia from California brought his showroom-worthy 1972 Datsun, packing a turbo-charged V8 with 600 horsepower. [Bisi] Gear ratio looks good. Temperature's good. You are good to go, sir. Go. [MH] All about speed. [MB] Listen to that sound. [MH] Saul flaunted his Datsun's elite speed through Fast Lane... [Bisi] Show them American power. [MH] ...and though he showed no fear in Forced Perspective... Oh, is he gonna slow down? No! [hosts yell in excitement] [MB] Ah, he hit the first marker. [MH] ...he missed his mark... He was so aggressive, but that's a penalty. [MH] ...and ultimately, his inability to get his car sideways in the precision elements... - [MB] Missed it. - [MH] No! Okay, try again. [MB] Missed it. [MH] ...left him floundering like a fish out of water. [MB] Come on, hit it! [Saul] Being a drag car, it's meant to go straight, and when you try to get it to kick out to the side, it doesn't like it. Just get out of there. [MB] Don't give it up! [Rut] No, he's going to take the max time. [MH] Looking to reverse the curse of raw horsepower on this speed track Jordan Martin pulled to the line, fresh off an impressive showing in Qualifier Two, a run that stunned the gallery by successfully drifting his 1,000 horsepower Lamborghini. [tires squeal] [crowd cheers] [MH] Nicely done. [Rut] Wow. You've just seen a Lamborghini drift and hit a target. Doesn't that feel amazing? [engine revs] [spotter] Go fast, be smooth. Call the obstacles out as I approach them. Ten-four, copy. [Rut] Jordan knows this speed track is perfectly suited for his super car. He and his spotter are feeling the pressure. They need to take advantage of this layout and qualify tonight. [spotter] I feel the courses after this will get harder and more challenging, and will require a lot more agility from the car driver, which is not our forte right now. [MH] Here we go. Jordan Martin, there's a lot riding on this first target. - [bang] - [Rut] Oh, he got it! - [MB] Nice, he got it. - [Rut] Unbelievable. [MH] With plenty of straightaways on this speed course, he let his Lambo fly and made up huge time on the rest of the field. [MB] That's the fastest speed we've seen so far! [engine revs] [MH] At Forced Perspective, the innovator pulled out another trick, folding his mirrors in to give himself a few extra inches of clearance. Mirrors in, confirmed. [MH] Smart move. Alright, here he comes. [announcer] 300 to Break Wall. - 200. - [MB] Come on! [announcer] 100. - [Rut] He got through. - [MB] Wow! [Rut] Nicely done. [MH] He blitzed the back half of the course... - [bang] - [MB] Whoa! [MH] ...proving without a doubt that he had the right car and the right skills to take down this Qualifier Three track. [crowd cheers] [MH] Jordan Martin finishing just four seconds behind Diego Higa. It looked like you were really showing us how fast this thing can go. You had so much speed. What is the risk factor involved? Whatever that cost, whatever I cost. Got a bit sketchy going down the back straight, round the big right-hander. A bit of a check-your-pants moment, but we made it through, so life's good. [MH] With four drivers down, it's already clear it'll take more than just raw horsepower to qualify tonight. Mick Wilkes and Saul Valencia learned that the hard way. Diego Higa and Jordan Martin turned in fast clean laps, and they're currently sitting at the top of our leader board. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver five, report to the start line. Driver five prepare for launch. [MH] Second time around for Polish drift queen, Karolina Pilarczyk and her pink Nissan looking good as always. She knows how to put on a show in more ways than one. Yeah, she went out there, finished in seventh place in Qualifier Two, but showed lots of skill in that beautiful car that she designed herself, and she did it all with a smile on her face. [engine revs] [Rut] Guys, this speed course is going to work in her favor tonight. We've already seen Diego and Jordan show us the road map for success here by being fast and agile. Karolina's car is both of those things. With 800 horsepower in this drift car, which was purpose-built so that one day she could compete here in the US, she is one of my picks to qualify tonight. [Karolina] I grew up in Poland and being a professional driver was my dream. Poland is very conservative. We still have this idea that the man is working and the woman is sitting at home. There is a common opinion that women are worse drivers than men, so nobody helped me to drive. People were telling me that I should be outside the car, posing, not driving the car. I wanted to prove to them that they are wrong. It took many years, but I created one of the strongest cars in Europe, one of the most recognizable teams in Europe, and in drifting, I won the 2016 and 2017 Queen of Europe. So I'm the best female drifter in Europe. [tires scream] My goal is not the trophies. My goal is to show other women and other people there are no limits. - [engine revs] - [crowd cheers] [MH] Here we go, Karolina Pilarczyk, first female drifter in Poland, Queen of Europe twice. Her fiancé, Mariusz will be in her ear, and looking to guide her to success here tonight. [in Polish] When the light turns white, put it in second. Over. [Karolina] Of course! [Mariusz] Get ready. Alright. Concentrate. [MH] Alright, let's get it done. Karolina Pilarczyk from Poland is ready for launch. - [engine roars] - Go, baby! [engine roars] [MH] Listen to that car! That's power right there, baby. [MB] Oh, listen to that. [Rut] There's that speed. Now, let's see her hang it out. - [bang] - [hosts] Whoa! Perfect! Wow! Perfectly done, well executed. - [bang] - Wow! Look at that. - [in Polish] Was it good? - Of course it was. [MH] Beautiful to watch those 800 horsepower under the hood help that car slide around the way it does. Both Diego and Jordan got it over 100 here and she's a right there with them. [Mariusz in Polish] All the gas now! [MH] Flying through that bad boy. Nicely done. Headed to the Forced Perspective. [MB] What do you think? Straight through, foot down, just goes for it, or takes her time? [MH] WFO, my friend. Wide freakin' open. Running just ten seconds behind Diego Higa to this point. [in Polish] Second and fire! When you move, a lot of smoke, fire! Got it. [engine revs] - [MH] Here she comes - [announcer] 300 to Break Wall. - 200, 100. - [Mike Hill shouts in excitement] [hosts] Wow! Perfect! [MH] Fast, clean, no penalties. What a run so far! Super! Hyper! [Rut] Guys, Karolina's car might just be the perfect weapon for this course. More power than Diego's, and this is a drift car through and through. So versatile and she knows how to use it. [Karolina] Woo-hoo! [MH] Now just six seconds behind Diego. [Rut] Guys, I got a real good feeling, if she can keep this lap at this pace, she's going to move on to the next round. [Mariusz] Go! [MH] She's neck and neck with our leaders. Can she keep it going? Push it! 11 feet, a little conservative there. [Rut] That's about twice as far as Diego was from the edge. This is a game of inches, so she'll be losing time here. Karolina's gonna have to really open it up down the back stretch now. [Mariusz] Okay, let's continue driving. [MH] Green light, there she goes. Running off the Leveler. [Rut] She's got to keep this pace up. [MH] A solid run so far. Karolina Pilarczyk has put herself in striking range of first place here at Qualifier Three, with one obstacle left. I bet she's going to kill these targets. [Rut] That's gonna be child's play to her. - [MH] Oh, but she doesn't... - [Rut] Whoa! [MH] She misjudged her speed into that turn and almost put it into the wall. [Rut] Lost her focus there. Nice recovery, but those are valuable seconds she's not getting back. [MH] She's put a lot of pressure on herself to ace Target Zone. Can she deliver? - [bang] - [MH] One target. [MB] Oh! - [bang] - [Rut] Yeah! - [in Polish] Did I make it? - Drive! Go! [Rut] Just absolutely crushed that. One continuous drift. [MH] Now it's just a race to the finish. Karolina Pilarczyk, the queen of Europe. Right into three here on Hyperdrive. - [Rut] Wow, guys. - [crowd cheers] [MH] 3:36. Good enough for third place behind Diego Higa and Jordan Martin. What a run! [MB] Beautifully done. But she did lose precious time out there with that hiccup on the last turn. Let me tell you, as a competitor, those are the mistakes that keep you up at night. I was driving quite fast and then, when I started to brake, I had some small issues there. It wasn't such a big mistake that I lost a lot of time. Of course, the differences between the drivers are seconds, right? So it counts. I hope I will be in the top three. I hope so. [MH] So here it is. For the moment, Karolina Pilarczyk sitting comfortably in third place. But with seven racers yet to take the track, she's going to have to wait and see if she did enough to qualify. [announcer] Driver six, report to the start line. [MH] With opportunities dwindling, the field was focused on doing whatever it took to knock Karolina out of third place, and earn a qualifying position. But driver number six, Axel Francois, had other ideas as he revealed his unique strategy for becoming Hyperdrive Champion. [Axel in French] In this race, I want to finish in the middle six again, So I can drive even more. The more I race, the better I feel, and that's my strategy. [MB] Let me get this straight. Axel doesn't want to qualify tonight so he can see more obstacles and practice more before the Knockout Rounds, but that assumes he's going to make the top three in the final qualifier. Is he out of his mind? [Rut] Oh, for sure. If that car doesn't make it, it sure wasn't a smart move, guys. [Mike Hill] Let's go! On his third trip around the Hyperdrive track... There it is. ...the French drifter was in cruise control. - [bang] - [hosts shout in surprise] [MB] He didn't even hit the brake! [Rut] That's a five-second penalty. Yee-ha! [MB] It doesn't seem to be bothering him. He's screaming, having a great time. [MH] Until disaster struck on the back stretch. [in French] What's going on? [Axel, in French] The gear shift broke! [Rut] Oh no, the gear shifter just broke off in his hand. He's trying to use his fingers to put it in gear. [MB] Come on, Axel. [Rut] Here we go. [MH] After finding second gear using only his hands, he had to limp his way through Target Zone. - [bang] - [hosts shout in excitement] [Rut] He's just fighting to stay alive now. Wow! [MH] And Axel had to scramble to get his car across the finish line and keep his hopes alive. [crowd cheers] [MB] 4:30. Will that be enough for a finish in the middle six tonight? [Rut] Axel Francois playing with fire here in Qualifier Three. [in French] I think that's the craziest thing I've ever done. [MB] Be careful what you wish for, my friend. [MH] Like Axel, it was race number three for Aaron Parker from California, who was worried his problems were all in his head. [Aaron] First race, my fault, second race my fault again, but I know that if I can put down a clean run, not make any mental mistakes, we're probably going to be aiming toward the top. If not, you know, it might be my last race. [MB] Let's go! [MH] And while his high-powered drift car seemed perfectly suited for this speed course. Nice, perfect. Perfect job. [MH] In the end, Aaron was re-introduced to his own worst enemy, himself. [MB] Oh, where's he going? [spotter] Hey, go back. You've got to get those targets. [Aaron swears] [MB] What was he thinking? [tires squeal] [Rut] See that, guys. He was going so hard, just over-cooked it. Just got to get it back. - [bang] - There it is. - [spotter] Nice. - [Rut] Here it is. Hit it, buddy. - [bang] - Nice recovery there. You're good. Get out of there. [MB] No, what's he doing? Hold on. Turn back around. [hosts groan] - [Rut] He's lost again. - [MH] Come on back. I've been making mistakes in things that I usually don't. So pretty disappointed in myself, to tell you the truth. [MH] Next to launch was a pair of Hyperdrive rookies. The eccentric Kansas City native, Tyrei Woodbury, and scientist Sherry Kamiya from San Francisco. [Tyrei] Show these people what we got, what we stand for. [MH] Both racers knew they'd have to ace the precision elements, or else their underpowered drift cars would be outmatched on this speed course. - Ready? - Yes. [Rut] Let's go! [MH] Tyrei was locked in as he approached the first target... - [bang] - Bam, there it is. [cheering] NIce contact made, you're good. [MH] ...while Sherry had trouble riding the line between fast and out of control. - [MB] Oh! - [Rut] Oh! [MH] Wow! I'm so sorry. Maybe got a little overexcited. [MH] So the pressure mounted to deliver in Target Zone, an obstacle tailor-made for their drift skills. Here we go. - [buzzer goes] - [MB] Another penalty. I'm sorry boys, but in a car that slow, you can't afford to pick up the penalties like that. - [bang] - [MH] There it is. You got it. Go! [MB] This one should be easy for her. This is her wheelhouse. - [MH] Oh! - [MB] Spoke too soon. [MH] Can she get the second one? She missed the second one. What on earth? After racking up costly penalties, Tyrei and Sherry saw their qualifying hopes evaporate, while Karolina Pilarczyk still held onto third place, but watched nervously as her rivals from Europe, husband and wife team, Alex and Corinna Graff look to steal her spot in the top three. [engine revs] [MH] Listen to that car. Wow! Just like Qualifier Two, the Graffs were in lock-step out of the gate. - [bang] - [Rut] Ooh yeah! [MH] Nicely done. But Forced Perspective proved to be the fork in the road... [Rut] Alex Graff through clean. - [bang] - [MH] ...as Corinna took a penalty and dug herself an even deeper hole at Target Zone. [Rut] Oh, what a terrible time for mental mistakes. She missed both. She's got to go back. She just drove herself right out of the top three. [bleep] [in German] Both of them! Alex kept the hammer down, gunning to crack the top three, and bump Karolina from her qualifying spot. - [bang] - [MB] He looks like a man on a mission. [bang] [MH] And by the narrowest of margins... [MB] He's got to hurry! [MH] ...he beat Karolina at the line. [cheering] So both the Polish drift queen and Corinna Graff will have to race again to qualify for the Knockout Rounds. Alright, y'all, 11 drivers down and that means we've got some concrete results here in Qualifier Three. We now know that Saul Valencia and Mick Wilkes will be packing their bags. They have been eliminated. Sherry Kamiyah, she is now on the bubble at 4:43 and at the top of the leaderboard, as expected, Diego Higa and Jordan Martin are guaranteed a spot in the Knockout Rounds, while Alex Graff will be hoping to hold on to third place. [announcer] Driver 12 to the start line. Driver 12 to the start line. [MH] Alright, our final driver of the night is getting ready to make his Hyperdrive debut. His name is Alexandre Claudin from France, and this dude has got a car that has to be seen to be believed, right, Rut? He brought the biggest car here, the iconic 1968 Dodge Charger. This is the car he always loved and decided he was gonna turn this into a pro drift car. Under the hood, the BMW M5 V8 that everybody loves here. This guy's gonna put on a show. [Alexandre, in French] The first time I felt adrenaline was most likely when... I first started mountain biking. I became a big cyclist and competed with the French team, and made it to the World Championship three times. Mountain biking can be dangerous for some people. It was really dangerous for me. From the age of 14 to 24, I broke 24 bones in my body. So that's why I don't mountain bike anymore. Quitting mountain biking was hard for me. I had to do something to push my limits. And then I discovered drift, and I was like, wow! I have less risk of getting injured while having as much fun. I wanted a car that was powerful, and different. My Dodge Charger is very special. It's an American car, and that represents my passion for American culture. It also represents how crazy I am. [laughs] - [crowd cheering] - [engine revs] [crowd clapping] [MH] There he is. Alexandre Claudin needs to beat Alex Graff's time of 3:34 to punch his ticket to the Knockout Rounds. Sherry Kamiya's 4:43 is the cut-off to avoid elimination. [crowd chanting] [Rut] I have just one question. Can Alexandre get this land yacht to hit a target? If he can, he has what it takes to qualify. Let's go down to Lindsay, who's with his spotter. Yes, it's his fiancée, Julie Fessy, and Julie's here right now, talking about how you're a little nervous, correct? Why? Because we came from France. So it's like a big trip for us. A lot of stress, here. And this car is very important to him, so... It's like his baby. Yeah. [crowd clapping and cheering] [MB] I met my ex-girlfriend on a racetrack. It didn't work out though. We drifted apart. [laughs] This is what we've come to expect with you, Bis. [laughs] - That's good! - You are amazing. - That is a good joke! - Great stuff, that's some of your best. [crowd getting excited] Woo! [MH] Right, Alexandre Claudin. [in French] Do I have to go? Yes, you don't have a choice. [engine revs] [tires squeal] [MH] And he's off. Let's go! [engine roars] [Alexandre, in French] Fast! [MH] You hear that big engine, screaming through that turn. One question though. Can Alexandre hit his first target in this behemoth of a Dodge Charger? [tires squeal] - [bang] - [MH] Oh! [MB] He's out of control. [everyone] Whoa! [MH] He got it to drift, but not exactly how he planned it. [Rut] Came in with too much speed, hit the target with the front of his car, and the momentum carried him into the course marker. Not a great start. [in French] Just breathe. Everything is perfect. [MH] Now it's a straight shot through fast lane. [engine revs] [Rut] He needs to open it up, hammer down and show off that muscle here. [engine roars] [MB] Look at that, beautiful. Perfectly done. [MH] He is handling this big boy. [in French] Clean and very fast. [Rut] Now he's on his way to Forced Perspective. Again, the widest car here. It's going to mess with his head a little bit [MH] Alexandre Claudin pulling into the first checkpoint, and with that penalty, he's running well behind Alex Graff, whose time he needs to beat to qualify for the Knockout Rounds. [in French] You're doing well so far. That's good, darling. [tires squeal] [Julie, in French] Go! [MH] Here he goes. He's going for it. - [MB] Oh, yeah. - [MH] Through the Forced Perspective. Can he make it through? [crowd groan] [MB] Come on. [MH] He clipped the Break Wall [MB] Oh, look at that, just the tiniest nick, but that's still a five second penalty, fellas. [Rut] Forget qualifying. Alexandre needs to go into survival mode right now. [engine revs] He's approaching the Leveler and this will be Alexandre's first trip up the monster. Look at this. He's now running neck-and-neck with Sherry Kamiya, whose time he needs to beat to remain in this competition, so... he's in the danger zone, fellas. We know the weight of that big car is definitely going to help speed that Leveler up on its way down. - [MH] There it is. - [MB] Floor it. [MH] He's got to push it as far as he can. He can't afford to lose any more time. Oh! [MB] No! [Rut] Oh! He pulls up 16 feet from the edge. [MH] That'll hurt him, right? [Rut] That defeats the purpose of that 2,500 pound advantage he had with this huge car. [Alexandre swears] [MH] He is losing precious seconds to Sherry Kamiya here, and has put a ton of pressure on himself in this final stretch to avoid elimination. [rattling] [splashing] [MB] Come on. [MH] There it is. Let's go. [in French] Alright, my love. Go for it! [Rut] Alexandre's fate is going to come down to whether or not this boat of a car can drift into these final two targets. [tires squeal] [MB] Alright, come on. Let's go. [in French] You're the best! Keep going! [MH] And now it's all about speed. Remember, he took the penalty at the first target, so he's gotta keep this clean - to avoid elimination. - [MB] Come on, hit those targets, buddy. [tires squeal] - [bang] - [MH] There he is, there's one. [engine revving] [tires squealing] - [bang] - [crowd screams excitedly] [in French] Great! Clean! [MB] There we go. So good. [MH] And now it's all about speed. It's gonna be close to the line. Will it be enough to keep him alive at Hyperdrive? [Julie, in French] Go! [MH] Oui, baby. - Woo! - [clapping] Crossing the line at 4:38, knocking Sherry Kamiya off the board and out of the competition, so Alexandre Claudin will live to race another day. [crowd cheering] [MB] Not what he was looking for in his Hyperdrive debut but he ain't feeling anything but relief right now, believe you me. [Rut] I'm just glad we get to see this guy get another crack at it. To be able to get a car this big to drift around a track, this guy has chops. Do not sleep on Alexandre. - American power. - Hai. Sure is. [laughter] [MH] Well that completes the night on this speed course. What another fun, fast, exciting qualifier. Let's take a look at our final results right now. We must say goodbye to Sherry Kamiya, Saul Valencia, and England's own Mick Wilkes. But at the top of the leaderboard, Diego Higa from Brazil, USA's Jordan Martin, and Alex Graff from Germany will be heading directly to the Knockout Rounds, where you can see that 9 of those 12 spots have already been filled, setting up a do-or-die scenario where tonight's middle six will move on to meet the last batch of newcomers on a brand new course in the fourth and final qualifying race. And guess what? Only the top three will be moving on. You feel that pressure? - Oh! - Oh! That's coming up next on Hyperdrive, starting right now.
