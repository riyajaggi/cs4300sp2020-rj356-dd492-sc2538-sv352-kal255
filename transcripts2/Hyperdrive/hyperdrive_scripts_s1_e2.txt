 [crowd chants] Stacey! [Mike Hill] Stacey Lee May, our final driver in Qualifier One. She needs to beat 5:35 to move straight to the Knockout Rounds, 6:07 to avoid elimination. Let's see what she's got. Tell me when to go, Daddy. Wait for the green light. [MH] Stacy Lee May. Ready to launch. Come on, Stacey. [tires squeal]

 - [engine roars] - [Michael Bisping] Let's go! [MH] The country of South Africa watching this 22-year-old from Soweto. [Rutledge Wood] She's got one of the lightest and most nimble cars in the competition. Perfect for drift obstacles like Light Box and Target Zone. [bump] [female announcer] Supernova engaged. [Rut] Let's see how she does here. Calm down. Hold it. [MH] Oh! She takes out a pylon. That's going to cost her two seconds. Oh, one pole. [Rut] Maybe a bit of nerves there. She didn't cut the wheel hard enough, didn't bring nearly enough speed to get the front end around for that Rockford turn.

 Calm down. Gotcha. But she's on her way to Light Box where she should excel. [Lester] Go. [MB] This is a big stage with a ton of pressure. She's just gotta listen to her father's voice, and do what she does best. [tires squeal] [Lester] Slow down slightly. [MH] Right now, Stacy's running ahead of Brent Pursifull's time, even with that two-second penalty. Keep it tight, don't mess the cones. [MH] Waiting for that pattern... There it is. [Lester] You're by one and three. [MB] Let's see those 540s, Stacey. Let's go put the foot down. [MH] Come on, girl. [Rut] Look at her. [MB] Cool as a cucumber. Out! [Mike Hill] Oh, there it is. [Rut] This is what she does for sport back in South Africa and she's making it look easy. [MH] Can she do it again? [Lester] Kick it! [Rut] Yes, and the crowd is going wild. This is beautiful! [MH] Absolutely crushed the Light Box. Gained a ton of time on that obstacle. Stacey's inching closer to a top three finish and an instant pass to the Knockout Rounds, as she heads to Walk on Water. [engine revs] She's got a real advantage here. The car is not one of these crazy, high horsepower cars that you got to worry about the water as much. But she's got to use those reflectors to stay on the path. - [Lester] Keep it tight. - [MH] Coming in with a lot of speed. Slow. The car is switched off. [engine turns over] What happened? Did it stall? - Ah, man. - [MH] Oh. The car died. [Rut] She stalled it. She went into that water too hard. She may have sucked up a bit of water into that intake. It doesn't want to go back on. [MB] Come on. [Rut] If it's only a little bit, you can try to blow it out. [MB] The clock's still ticking, guys. It took in water. Okay now, try again. [engine turns] [Stacey] No. - [guy] Let's go, Stace! - [girl] Go, Stacey! [MB] She's trying. Come on! [engine revs] - [Rut] There's some life. Yeah! - [MB] Yes! [MH] She's back up, but that wiped out her lead on Brent, so Stacey has no margin for error on these last two obstacles. [MB] Stacey, put that foot down. [bang] [cheers] [MB] That was awesome. [MH] What a recovery! Stacey Lee May with a beautiful line through Target Zone, and now there's only one obstacle between her and the finish. She's on to the Leveler. Got to bring as much speed to this as she can. [engine dies] - [MB] Oh! - [MH] Did it stall again? I think it stalled again. [Rut] That engine is still struggling from all that water. [MB] Come on! [MH] She's losing a lot of speed into our final checkpoint. [Rut] If she can keep the engine hot, she's going to be able to keep going. [MH] Look at that split, just five seconds ahead of Brent Pursifull, Stacy Lee May is still in this, but she's gotta clear the water out of the engine if she's going to survive the Leveler. [MB] Alright, Stacey. Come on! [engine revs] [guy] Go, Stacey! - Come on, Stacey. - Come on, Stacey. [engine splutters] [engine dies] The motor broke. [crowd groans] Oh... just try to start it again. - [engine turns over] - Come on. Come on, please. Please. [engine splutters and dies] [crowd shout in disappointment] [Rut] The engine is toast. She got water in there. I think it's done for. No... [car door clunks] [moans softly] [MH] See, she's wrecked with emotions right now. I can only imagine what her father is going through, her spotter. Don't worry. [Stacey] I'm sorry. It's not your fault. [Stacey sobbing] Okay? - [sobs] - Calm down. I came so far and the motor broke. I'm sorry. Then we'll fix it, okay? Okay, calm down. We're going to sort it out. [kiss] [MH] Lester Lee May dropped everything. Sold his tow truck for his daughter to be in this international competition. I'm sure this is not how they expected it to go. So for Stacey Lee May, unfortunately, she'll join Ed Michalak and Michael Pettiford in the bottom three. That group posted the slowest finishing times in Qualifier One, which means they are now officially eliminated from this competition. Not just her family, not just the people in South Africa, but everybody right now watching this young lady. She should be proud of what she accomplished tonight, just being out here. And this is her dream as well. She dreamed of this being a catalyst for her to drive in movies like The Fast and the Furious one day. I think she's still got a great chance of that. She did fantastically. She's disappointed. She's crushed, but look at what she overcame. The adversity in her life to be here at this moment, doing this, handling herself with such class. It's beautiful. [MH] Man, what a night. Our first qualifier is in the books. João Barion from Brazil, Brittany Williams and Faruk Kugay, both from the USA, posted the fastest three finishing times. They'll be skipping the next three qualifier courses and advancing straight to the Knockout Rounds, where they will be continuing their quest for the Hyperdrive Championship. [Faruk Kugay] It feels amazing to beat these kinds of drivers on this eclectic track. What we learned from the first race is how dynamic this racetrack is. We really need to adapt our car to an element that we've never seen before or heard of before. So I'm honored and I look forward to seeing what the rest of the competition holds. [MH] As for the middle six finishers, they will have to race again in a matter of moments, as they will be moving on to qualifier number two, where they will be joined by six new competitors and their custom-built cars, all looking to crack the code on this Hyperdrive track. But the track won't be the same, right, Rut? That's right. The Hyperdrive track has been completely reconfigured for this race. After the trouble our drivers faced at Walk on Water in Qualifier One, we've doubled down and created a new course we affectionately call H2O. This will be the ultimate test of adaptability. We've got more turns, double the targets, and we added a brand new obstacle, the Water Cannon. Drivers will be chased by an avalanche of water, 1,400 gallons raining down on them from above. Look out! The ultimate test of engines and ingenuity continues right here, right now. This is Hyperdrive. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver One, prepare for launch. [Mike Hill] Our first racer is a newcomer in Qualifier Two. Jordan Martin. He admits that he does not have a car built for this type of competition, but he wants to prove to everybody out there that he is a driver that knows how to adapt. [Rut] That's right. Jordan is driving a Lamborghini Huracan, a $200,000 sports car with a twin-turbo engine, packing 1,000 horsepower. This may seem like the best car here, but a Lambo is designed to stick to the track, which makes drifting nearly impossible. But Jordan has made his living solving problems, and he and his team think they can pull off the impossible. [engine revs] [Jordan] I own an automation company, Martin Automatics, a family company. It designs machines for the printing, packaging, and converting industries. From a young age, I was always taking things apart. Anything from phones to small engines and all that kind of stuff. My dad pretty much had to lock the tools up from age of about two on. It's kind of a sickness, really. I tweak things, I tinker, and eventually that pointed me in the direction of cars. Hi, guys. - How's it going? - Hey. Hey, buddy boy. As I've gotten a little older, I've been really fortunate in that I've been able to afford some cool things and get to play, when I have spare time, and still be there for my kids, for my wife. [wife] Can you give dad a bite? Dad wants a bite of your yogurt. - Mm. Good. - [wife laughs] - Yum, thank you. - Hand yogurt, the best kind. [engine starts] [Justin] Now I own a Lamborghini Huracan, and it just wasn't doing it for me. So I thought, let's figure out how to make this better. So we kind of started developing the car, and put giant turbos on it, like, "Ooh, this is 1,000 horsepower. Awesome!" But there's a lot of drifting here and that's definitely a new one for me. Everyone's still saying, "Oh my God, how are you going to get an automatic Lambo to drift? This is insane. Man, I feel sorry for this guy." I mean, no one's ever seen it, but it's racing. Anything can happen. [crowd cheers] [MH] Jordan Martin. This guy's a multi-millionaire with several patents. They call him "the mid-west MacGyver." Rut, what's he got to do to adapt to this track? [Rut] This is an all-wheel-drive car. But, Jordan and his team have "MacGyvered" a switch that cuts the power to the front wheels, making it rear-wheel-drive. Their plan is to use all-wheel drive for speed and two-wheel for the precision obstacles. First stop is the Rockford turn at Supernova. So we're about to find out if they're as smart as they think. All-wheel drive. - All-wheel drive engaged. - [engine revs] [MH] Here he is. Jordan Martin, ready to launch. - [engine roars] - [hosts whoop in excitement] [Rut] Man! Did you see how quickly he got to the first turn? That's what a 1,000 horsepower will do. [MH] Coming up on Supernova, his first test. - Two-wheel. - Two-wheel engaged. [announcer] Supernova engaged. [MB] Let's see this bad boy in reverse. [Rut] Going a little slow, guys. [engine revs] [tires squeal] - Oh! - Ooh. Not a great execution right there. [MB] That's a penalty. [MH] But he only took out one. [Rut] Jordan is already struggling to rotate that car. These guys might be in way over their heads. [spotter Martin] Go! [MH] He's got a chance to show off some of that speed on his way to the next obstacle. But he's going to have to get it sideways to hit that turn two target. [MB] I've got a feeling this is going to be rough. [engine revs] - [bang] - [crowd cheers] [MH] Nicely done. [MB] Wow! [Rutledge Wood] Unreal. You've just seen a Lamborghini drift and hit a target. Doesn't that feel amazing? [MB] I am speechless. That is insane. [MH] You rarely see a Lamborghini wanting to hit anything. Jordan Martin putting it on the line tonight, though, as he gets ready to go into the Light Box. Two-wheel. Two-wheel. [Rut] That two-wheel switch that puts it into rear-wheel-drive worked at the first target, but here in Light Box, spinning two 540s in a tight space, this is the true test. Two, three. - [MH] Here we go. - [MB] Come on. [tires squeal] - [bang] - [hosts] Whoa! [MB] That's a penalty. [Rut] He couldn't get it to rotate the one way, now he's trying again. Oh! - Yes. - Oh yes. Now three. [MB] This car is loaded with computers trying to fight everything he's doing to it, right? [Rut] Exactly, it still doesn't want to do what he's asking it to do. [MH] Now see, he's sliding it in there! [MB] Look at that! There we go! [Rut] Yes! Jordan is proving everyone wrong. [MB] Wow, that's more like it. Awesome, good work. All-wheel. [MH] Going to Walk on Water. Now with all the systems inside this car, any water getting inside, will that affect it at all? [Rut] This car has been heavily modified, but I think its factory roots will keep it dry. Look at him. He's in all-wheel drive mode now. You saw him drop a wheel off. He's having a bit of trouble staying on the mark there. Two-wheel. [Rut] Jordan's flipping that switch for two-wheel drive to hit this target. - [engine revs] - [bang] [hosts shout] Oh! - [MB] Yes! - [MH] That was awesome! [MH] That was beautiful. Good hit. Nice job. All-wheel drive. [Rut] Oh! To see a Lamborghini just hanging out like that makes me so happy. [MH] He is wide open. [MB] He is flying around this track there. [MH] Alright fellas, Jordan Martin, approaching a brand new feature. The Water Cannon. Look at it, a 1,400 gallon waterfall followed by a tight 360 barrel turn. Drivers can either wait it out and lose time, or try and beat the six-ton wave off the line. [Rut] If anyone's got the speed to race this wave, it's this 1,000 horsepower Lambo. Can Jordan do it? You're in all-wheel, right? All-wheel. Good. - [MB] Go! - [bang] [Rut] Here he goes. [engine roars] [MH] Can he beat the water? - [splash] - [hosts] Oh! - [MB] Almost. - [Rut] He beat the worst of it, but can he execute this barrel turn? [MB] This is not good. I can drive around in circles all day long, you've got to drift around that son-of-a-gun. [Rut] He's in all-wheel drive, he didn't swap back, so he can't make a nice tight doughnut. [MH] Lost some time there. Now headed over to the Leveler. We've seen this bad boy before, but this time, the driver's got to attack it with soaking wet tires. Activate lift. Axle lift. [Rut] Perks of owning a Lambo: factory axle lift so he doesn't bottom out going up this 40% incline. [engine revs] [MH] Here he comes in the Lambo, going up the Leveler. [Martin] Stop! [hosts] Whoa! [Michael Bisping] Very nicely done. [Rut] He struggled with some of the drifting on this course, but the Lamborghini helped him here. The advanced traction control let Jordan charge up there fast. With all-wheel drive, once he gets down, this guy has nothing stopping him. [splash] [MB] He's got a few penalties though. [Rut] Can he go fast enough to erase those penalties? That's the question. [Mike Hill] Here we go! [engine roars] He's going to open it up. [Rut] Look at him, he's flying. He's got 1,000 horsepower bringing him to us as quick as he can. You've got a sharp turn here. [hosts] Whoa! [MB] Good, though. [Rut] When you have all four wheels digging like that with all-wheel drive, he doesn't have to slow down as much as other people. [MH] Here he comes, Jordan Martin, the multi-millionaire from Illinois. [MB] Smartest guy in the room. Can he outsmart the track? [MH] Let's go! Jordan Martin coming down the stretch! Right here at Hyperdrive. The Lambo can go. [MB] Unbelievable. Those twin turbos, you feel it in your chest. He had a couple of penalties at the start, but he made up for it on the straightaways, put the foot down and hit that speed. [Rut] I can't believe that he was able to get that car to do things it is not built and designed to do. You know the people at Lamborghini are happy. [laughing] [MH] Alright y'all, with Jordan Martin in the top spot, that means the field will now be chasing the most expensive car in the competition. And once again, tonight's top three finishers will move straight to the Knockout Rounds. The middle six will have a chance to drive again in the third of our four qualifying races, and the bottom three, well, they will be eliminated. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver Two, prepare for launch. [MH] Next to the line was a trio of dragsters, sporting a ridiculous collection of horsepower. Brent Pursifull, the Kentucky dentist, US Army vet and Blackhawk helicopter mechanic, Mark Rios, and 53-year-old drag racing legend, Mike Martin. [Mike Martin] I've crossed the finish line before with my front wheels two foot in the air at 200-some mile an hour. [engine roars] I'm not scared. [onlookers shout] Whoa! [MM] I've come to win. Second place is first loser, and I don't like to lose. [Mike Hill] Here we go, I am so excited. [Rut] I'm on the edge of my seat. [MH] All three knew they could show their blinding speed, but could they adapt to the twists and turns of the Qualifier Two track? [engine revs] [tires squeal] [MB] Wow! [MH] Man! You can feel that power! Wow. [MB] Wow! Look at that thing go. [MH] Just like Jordan, these speed demons all struggled at Supernova. [MB] Eh, yow! - [MH] Here he goes for that Rockford turn. - [bang] But it was Mark Rios who struggled the most with the Rockford turn. - [bang] - [MB] Oh! Look at that. [MH] That's two. - [bang] - [MB] There's three. This looks like my mom trying to do a three-point turn. Come on, Mark. [MH] He hoped to make up time with the competition's most powerful car, a Chevy Camaro drag car with 1,300 horsepower. [Rut] Now he's got to hit the target. [hosts] Oh! You missed it. - [MH] He's got to go back. - [MB] Ah, man. - [engine turns over] - [bleep] [MH] But none of that mattered, as Mark's car flamed out and refused to restart. [engine turns over] - We popped a relay or fuse, or something. - [bleep] It can happen that quickly. A relay, a fuse, and then what have you got? A really cool paperweight. [engine roars] [MH] Brent and Mike cruised through the first target, but Brent struggled keeping up the precision he needed at Target Zone. [Brent] I'm going to clutch-kick it. [MH] He missed it. - Did I get it? - [spotter] Almost. [MB] Got to go back. Hit it, buddy. - [hosts] Oh! - [MH] So close. Did I get it? No! Do it again. [MH] For the second race, Brent was left worried more about the bottom three than qualifying for the Knockout Rounds. [bang] [spotter] You've got it! [MH] Mike Martin flew through Target Zone and pulled up to the checkpoint at Water Cannon, ready to race the wave in his 800 horsepower stock Camaro with nitrous boost. [MB] Yes! Come on! Go! [MH] But at the barrel turn he lost time with a clumsy 360. This is the one that I suck at. Spin around there, baby. [MH] When he crossed the line, he couldn't match the Lambo, finishing 30 seconds behind Jordan. I think I need new tires. [MH] With four racers down, Jordan Martin is still holding onto first place, but guys, no one has really put together a great lap so far. So we'll see how these times hold up as the night goes on. [announcer] Driver Five to the start line. Track is hot. Driver Five, prepare for launch. [spotter] Alright Sara, two minutes. [Mike Hill] Our next racer is Sara Haro, truck driver from Tampa, Florida who finished sixth place in Qualifier One. Bis, she's driving her stock V6 Mustang, which isn't the most powerful car in the competition, but man, this car means the world to her. [MB] Absolutely. She was raised in Sweden, but came out here to America a few years ago to build a relationship with her father, and it was her father who bought her this beautiful car. So as you said, it means everything to her. My name's Sara Haro, I'm 22 years old, and I'm a truck driver. It's a sweaty, dirty job, but I like it. I always loved machinery, anything that takes you from one point to another. Just being able to be behind a wheel, either as a hobby or as a job, it's all I can ask for. [laughs] I was born in Tampa, Florida, but around one year old, my mom and dad got a divorce. I moved to Sweden with my mom. It was not easy. At school I got bullied a lot, because I was American, I was different. They called me names, made fun of me and so on, all the way up to high school. So I decided to move to America, and I'm going to get to know my dad better. My dad definitely got me into cars. He knew I was always very interested in racing. I have a 2014 Mustang. My dad got it for me as a graduation gift. People don't think much of it because it's a V6. They think you should have a V8. They think I'm just a beginner, I'm still learning. That kinda motivates me to say: "Bet? You want to see it drift? I'll show you." I just love the adrenaline. Getting out after drifting it around, almost shaking. You're like, "Ah, it was so fun. I want to do it again." From being bullied, I've learned no matter what people think of you, no matter what people say, you just got to keep going for what you want. It's your life, so let's do this thing. [engine revs] [MH] Sara Haro at the line in that 2014 Mustang. Her best friend and spotter, Tiffany, is standing by. Let's find out what's going on down there with Lindsay. [Lindsay] Hey, Mike. How different does all this feel, being back up here? I think that she'll do great. She's super excited. She's more confident. She's done the course. And I think that'll help us both. She's gonna do great. [MH] We'll see. Rut, what should we expect of Sara tonight? [Rut] Guys, this is a stock car. This was her daily driver a few weeks ago that she stripped out for this. This course demands more than just raw horsepower. It's not just about a car. It's about the person holding the wheel. [Sara] Bun Bun, you ready? I'm ready. Are you ready? Hell, yeah. Go! [Mike Hill] Let's go! Wow! Look at the speed she's bringing, guys. She's using all 305 horsepower. Nowhere near as fast as the Lambo, but she'll have an advantage in the precision obstacles. - You got it, just keep going. - [thud] [announcer] Supernova engaged. [MH] Here comes the Rockford turn. Let's see if she can get it this time. [Rut] Come on, Sara. [MB] Look at that! Wow! - [bang] - [MH] Oh! Wow, but what a great Rockford turn. [MB] One penalty. That was so good, so close. [bang] - [crowd groans] - Damn it. That's okay. [MH] Still having problems with that Rockford turn, but remember, she recovered last time around. Next up she's got the Turn 2 Target. [Rut] This is a big obstacle for her. This is where she can show everyone that she can drift this V6 Mustang. [Bun Bun] You got it. - [tires squeal] - [MB] Oh! - [bang] - [MH] Yeah! [crowd cheers] [engine revs] [Rut] Yeah! Nicely done, Sara. Good! You guys may not know this, not coming from the car world. This is the best a Mustang V6 has ever looked. What Sara is doing with this car is so impressive. I am so proud of her. [MH] Sure enough, Sara is sitting just seconds behind our leader, Jordan Martin, at the first checkpoint. [Bun Bun] Light Box time. You got this. [MH] There's the pattern right there. [Rut] She's done well in the first two obstacles. Let's see if she can keep it going here in the Light Box. [MH] Into the first one. You got it. [Rut] Here it is. Pin it. Slide it. Yeah. There we go! - [MB] Yes. - [MH] Nicely executed there. Nicely done. [Bun Bun] There you go. [MH] Into the second box. [Rut] Yeah, there you go! Sick! [MH] Nicely done. - [Rut] She's got it. - [MB] She did it. [Bun Bun] Good job. Stay in the groove. You've got it. [Rut] She's headed to Walk On Water, which again is an advantage for her, because this car is so much closer to stock. So she's going to be able to go after it a lot harder. [hosts, excitedly] Whoa! [MH] Sara Haro with a great run so far, but almost throws it the way into Walk on Water! That's okay. [MH] Almost overshot that turn. [Rut] Wow! Look at the speed she's bringing, guys. [MH] Look at that splash. [bleep] I can't see. [MH] Driving very aggressively. [Rut] There you go. [MH] Nicely done. [Bun Bun] Good job. Wow! You did that fast. [MH] Now to hit that target. [Bun Bun] You got it. [bang] - [MH] Oh! - [MB] Yeah, Sara! - [bang] - [MB] That is how you do that. That was perfect, and then got good speed on the exit. [Bun Bun] Good girl! Stay focused. [MH] There she goes. Making her way toward the next obstacle. Ready for the Water Cannon? Oh yeah. [Sara whispers] Okay. [tires squeal] [MH] Skidding into the checkpoint and look at this. She is now neck-and-neck with our leader, Jordan Martin, with only two obstacles to go. [Rut] Jordan struggled with this barrel turn. She's got a shot to leap-frog him right here. [boom] [MB] Let's go! [MH] 1,400 gallons of water coming down on her. [MB] Come on! [Rut] Oh, look at that! [MH] Took that right on the head. Couldn't beat it. Look at that water coming off her tires and now she's got to hit that barrel turn. [tires squeal] [Rut] Yes. Awesome! [MH] Super clean. Exactly what she needed. Think I need new tires after this. [MH] She just gained six full seconds on Jordan there. Sara Haro making moves with just one obstacle left. Go! [MH] Here she goes. [engine roars] [hosts yell in excitement] [Rut] Oh my gosh! Wow! No fear off the line. She charged up the Leveler. 13 feet is exactly where she needs to be. [MB] This is a heavier car, it should bring the Leveler down quicker. Look at you. You're smart, Bisping. Well, I did a little Physics at school. A little Physics? [Rut] Guys, we're about to see Sara in a V6 Mustang race a Lamborghini in a half-mile sprint to the finish line with only a six-second head start. This is what racing is all about. [Bun Bun] Go! [MH] She wants it. Here we go! 5:13, the time to beat. [MB] Come on, Sara. Guys, this is going to come down to the wire. Go! [engine roars] [MB] She's on the home strait. Going to be so close. Bring it home. [Rut] Come on, Sara! [MH] Sara Haro, the underdog, making a run for first place in her V6 Mustang. Go get it! Yes! - [MH] Yeah! - [MB] Amazing! [Rut] Oh, it's so awesome! So the V6 Mustang beats the Lamborghini. No one in their right mind would ever say that's possible. [MH] How about Sara Haro coming out and putting up the top time on the leaderboard? What a statement. [Rut] I love that in Hyperdrive, skill is the equalizer, not horsepower, not a fancy car, but what you can do with the car you've got. [Sara] Tiffany walked up to me, so happy. She's a perfect spotter. And when she said that time I was like... No! [laughs] High five. [male announcer] Five minute warning. [female announcer] Track is hot. After your run, the beer is cold. Okay. [in German] Then I'll go fast, I need my beer. [MH] After Sara Haro took over the top of the leaderboard, an invasion of drifters hit the track. Three of Europe's best, and two returning for another shot at the top three. Alex and Corinna Graff, a married couple from Germany, competing against each other on the course. Both got behind the wheel to prove that they are the fastest couple in the world. [Corinna] In Germany, Alex and I are known as the fastest couple in drift. Every race, we have our family with us. [Alex, in German] The kids were always sleeping in the trunks of our cars, or directly by the race track. [engines roar] [Corinna] That's the main part of our success. We share the passion of drifting. [Alex, in German] We both understand what it takes to be racers, and we complement each other. [Corinna] We are rivals. But when we come back in the pits, we love each other. - [engine revs] - [crowd cheers] [MH] Germany's best is about to show everyone how it's done. [MB] Here we go. [MH] Let's go! [MH] The Graffs roared out of the gate and aced the Turn 2 Target. [in German] Good! Keep going! [MH] With the help of their daughter as his spotter, Alex took an early lead on his wife Corinna... Look at that smoke, baby. [in German] You're doing good. [MH] ...when she stumbled, completing her second 540 at Light Box. [MB] Took it a little wide. Stalled it. [in German] Crap! [MH] Neither racer found an advantage at Target Zone. [bang] [in German] Good! Super! [MH] But Alex made a costly mistake coming into the last turn... [in German] Papa, right turn! Go back! [MH] Missed his turn. Got to back up. That'll cost him valuable seconds. ...which gave Corinna daylight to blaze down the final stretch... She's got a chance. Here she comes. Corinna Graff. Yeah! ...beating her husband and taking home family bragging rights. You beat your husband. Yes, whoa! Really? I'm so sorry. [laughs] [MH] Following the Graffs, Polish pioneer and drift champion, Karolina Pilarczyk hit the track to plant her flag as the top drifter at Hyperdrive. [tires squeal] - [bang] - [MH] Boom, there it is. Go! [MH] After seeing many drifters struggle in Qualifier One, she took a very cautious approach to Walk on Water. [MB] She's going so slow, Rut. [Rut] You don't want to suck water into this engine, or her day is done. [MH] So she's running a very smart race so far, - [bang] - and she hits that target! [Karolina] Woo hoo! [in Polish] On fire! [MH] Her snail's pace through the water may have kept her engine dry, but cost her precious time, as she finished her race six seconds behind her European rival, Corinna. Go ahead, girl. [engine revs] Following the European newcomers, Aaron Parker strapped in for a second run after losing his cool and his bumper on the Qualifier One track. [bang] But Aaron's Mazda RX-7 started having problems right away at the Turn 2 Target. [Aaron] Something's wrong with the suspension. The toe is way off. Something must have moved quite a bit. Feels like it's about to break. [MH] With precious time slipping away, Aaron took a huge gamble, choosing to wait out the water cannon... [Rut] He is trying to play it smart. [MH] ...hoping to avoid any further damage to his car. [Rut] Grab that barrel turn. [MH] Look at that spin! [MB] Beautiful. [MH] That bet paid off, as Aaron finished safely in the middle six, but left the track frustrated at the mistakes he can't seem to shake. Something was off on the steering. Really disappointing for something like that to affect me, because it's like a kick in my own ass. [MH] Finally, Axel Francois, the Frenchman returning from Qualifier One, made some changes to his car for a rematch with Walk On Water. [Axel, in French] What troubled me most in the first race was the steam on the windshield coming out on Walk on Water. I'm going to try to fix that. I'm going to try to waterproof it as much as possible. [Rut] Sideways into Walk on Water. Look at that! [MH] But his waterproofing did not work, and once again, Axel's car filled with steam and left him blind. - [Axel, in French] I can't see anything. - You're good. Keep going. [MH] For the second straight race, Axel relied on his spotter, Lise, and his raw driving skills to overcome his mistakes and floor it across the finish line in second place. [crowd cheers] [MH] Axel Francois, baby. - Oui? - Oui. [howls in joy] [MH] With ten drivers down, let's take a look at our leaderboard. Sara Haro has officially punched her ticket to the Knockout Rounds, with Axel Francois and Jordan Martin rounding out the top three. Meanwhile at the bottom, Mark Rios has been eliminated, while Brent Pursifull and Mike Martin are on the bubble, anxiously awaiting the last two runs of the night. [announcer] Track is hot. Prepare for launch. [engine starts] [MH] Alright guys, second time around for Atsushi Taniguchi from Japan. the guy who gave us our biggest thrill and our biggest scare in that first qualifier. You remember, he was having a flawless run before going airborne at the Leveler. I know my heart stopped, so I can't even imagine what he was feeling, but he was able to recover and finish his run to be right here. [Rut] Atsushi is known as the Drift Sensei, and for good reason. He started his own drifting school after a tragedy changed his life forever. [Atsushi, in Japanese] I work at a drift school that I started. I started this job because of Hideyuki. We were close friends. One day, it was a workday evening, his mother called me. In his town there is a road from the train station that goes straight up to his home. He must have been going pretty fast up the hill when he crashed. It was a terrible accident. Mm, yes. She told me he died immediately in the car accident. That is the reason I teach drift techniques at my school. Maybe if Hideyuki knew the technique of drifting, he may have been able to prevent the crash. Sometimes I visit his grave. Hideyuki had always supported me. Even now, if I get a little luck, maybe it is him, giving me power from somewhere. [engine roars] [MH] I think Hideyuki must be watching over Atsushi, because he somehow survived that jump at the Leveler, and although he missed out on the top three, he now gets to race again in Qualifier Two. - [in Japanese] Let's raise your spirits! - [Atsushi] Let's do that, man! Here you go! [MH] As you see, Jordan Martin is currently in third place. Beating his time would put Atsushi into a qualifying position. And Brent Pursifull, well, he's on the bubble again, fellas. This run right here could be sending him home. [Ken, in Japanese] Here you go! Are you ready? [in Japanese] Sure, let's do it! [Ken] Go! [MH] Let's go! [Rut] Atsushi is an old-school drifter, which means no hand brake. It's all about gas, brake and clutch. We saw him absolutely own the Supernova before. Can he do it again? [Ken, in Japanese] Make sure to hit the target first. [bang] [announcer] Supernova engaged. [MH] Here he goes. [MB] Let's see how straight he is. [tires squeal] [crowd cheers] [MH] Nicely done! Okay! [Rut] Flawless. Look at him. See how he's throwing the steering wheel of the car. It's all gas, brake and clutch. It's not using the hand brake. He's so old-school with how he drifts. [MB] That was the best Supernova we've seen, in my opinion. Even better than the first one. [in Japanese] Try to hit the accelerator hard! Here he is, coming up on that target. He's got to kick that tail out. - [bang] - [cheers] [Rut] Wow! Look at that. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! Nice! [Rut] Yeah, baby! [MB] That's such great accuracy. It's fantastic. [MH] Headed to the Light Box now. Atsushi looking good through the first two obstacles. Coming into the checkpoint and he's already built a nice little lead on Jordan Martin. [in Japanese] Okay, take a breath. You can go at the first light. Ooh! [laughs] [in Japanese] Ah! Which one will turn on? That makes me nervous. [Atsushi laughs] Go! [MH] He's got the pattern. [Rut] Look how hard Atsushi's going. He also took off once he saw the first box go off. He didn't wait to see the second. He knows his spotter will point him towards the second box once he gets this first 540. [MH] Got the first one. [Ken in Japanese] The second one is opposite. [Rut] This is so beautiful, the way he's drifting between boxes, and remember, no hand brake. The skill that requires is for real. [MH] Look at that. Oh! Nicely done! [in Japanese] Wonderful! [Rut] And now he's headed towards Walk On Water. [Ken] Wipers! [Rut] In the last round, he was one of the hardest chargers going into the water. Will he be again? [MB] Yes. - [Ken, in Japanese] Target on your right. - Okay. - [MH] Now he's got to hit the target. - [bang] - [Atsushi] Okay. - [in Japanese] You hit it. Okay. [Rut] He is such a wheel man, it is unbelievable. [engine revs up] - [MH] He's flying around that track. - [MB] He's flying. [Ken in Japanese] Turn around the outside and stop at the light before the Water Cannon. [MH] Picked up some time on the Lambo as he waits for the Water Cannon. [groans in excitement] [Rut] Trying to get a little cool air in there. [MB] Maybe it was that burrito. He had that burrito for lunch and it's like, he knew it was a bad idea. A little spicy. [MH] Now can he outrun 1,400 gallons of water? [Ken] Go! - [MH] He's going to try and beat it. - [MB] Let's go! [sound-effect voice shouts] Atsushi! [splash] [MB] That was nice! [MH] He outran the worst of it but those tires are wet. [MB] Look at this. [MH] Like clockwork. [MH] Now we've got his nemesis, the Leveler. [Rut] I tell you what, he'll be totally different this time. [MB] Yeah, but listen, I don't think he's got it in him to take it easy. He wants to get up there as fast as he can. - [in Japanese] Will you jump or not? - Why not? I will jump, man! Don't miss it. [laughs] Come on, man! I'm ready. [MH] Here we go. [Ken in Japanese] Go to the top. [MH] Come on, push it. He made it, yes he did! [MB] Incredible. Atsushi is gonna fly down this back stretch. [Rut] He is gonna wind that 2JZ engine out, power down, turbo spool the whole way back. Is he gonna take the top spot? [Ken] Go! [MB] Come on, buddy. [Rut] Show us how it's done, sensei. - [Atsushi in Japanese] It's a short cut. - [Ken] Right side! [tires squeal] [Rut] He's got to get that power down. [in Japanese] Full throttle! Go! - [MH] Look at that. - [MB] He is way ahead. [MH] He might break five minutes. Atsushi Taniguchi from Japan. The Drift Sensei. Teaching a lesson right here on Hyperdrive! - Yeah! - [crowd cheers] [MH] Yes! Look at that run! Guys, look at that run. [MB] That is how you do it. - [in Japanese] Four minutes something. - Yes. [MH] Atsushi Taniguchi qualifying for the Knockout Rounds in dramatic fashion, with a sub-five-minute run, and in turn, officially eliminating the dentist, Brent Pursifull, from the competition. Meanwhile, Jordan Martin has been bumped out of his spot in the top three and will now have to drive again in the next qualifying race. Did you see my perfect run? [laughs] [MB] Atsushi is stealing the show. The first time, he had the most drama. Still got a decent time, had that. He got airborne on the Leveler. This time comes up, smashes the track, gets a record time. Guys, that was a scorcher of a lap. Wow! [announcer] Track is hot. Driver 12, report to the start line. Driver 12, prepare for launch. [spotter] Alright, Fielding, I'll see you on the start line. [engine revs] [MH] Alright fellas, our last driver in Qualifier Two is one Fielding Shredder, and Bis, this dude lived up to his name in Qualifier One. Absolutely shredding up the track, delivering one of the most exciting runs of the night. Absolutely fantastic. Very fast, but a reckless driver. He spoke about that, coming into the lap, and he lived up to that reputation. Flew through the course, got to Walk On Water, didn't slow down at all and that cost him big time. [Fielding] Walk on Water the second time, won't be any different. I'll go as fast as I can through it, but I have definitely implemented a couple of changes. We've taken some rubber floor mats and cut them up. My spotter and I taped them and zip-tied them. and I've got a trashcan that I've cut up and gotten around the intake filter. It's risky, but so is drifting, so is throwing my car at walls at 100 miles an hour. I mean, that's what I'm here for. I'll roll the dice and see what happens. Seven. There you go. It'll be a good run. [engine revs] [Rut] Guys, this patchwork waterproofing fix is risky, but I'm more worried about Fielding's driving. This guy is a madman behind the wheel, which is really fun to watch, until it isn't. Alright Fielding, you got this. Keep calm. [MH] Remember, Fielding Shredder was the first driver ever to take the Hyperdrive course, and just missed out on that Knockout Round. Now he's our final driver here at Qualifier Two. So at the moment, it's Axel Francois who holds the third spot, but on the chopping block is Mike Martin. So those are two racers who will be watching this one very closely. - [engine revs] - [MH] Here we go. [Rut] Woo! [MH] Come on, baby. That scares me every time. [tires squeal] Woo! [engine revs] [MH] Wow, what a takeoff! [Rut] Look at that drifting. He's linking the whole thing already. So sick. Alright, into Supernova. Hit the target, keep it tidy. [MB] Yeah, so he's definitely going to take it easy. [annouoncer] Supernova engaged. [MH] There it is. I got a feeling he's going to hit this hard. [MB] Come on. - [tires squeal] - [hosts shout excitedly] - [MB] That was a little scary. - [MH] Got it! Nice job. [Rut] Carried a ton of speed through that Rockford turn. Couldn't have cut it closer. Just missed those pylons. Man, he is all about drift style and speed, look at that. He is linking all these challenges so beautifully. That's how he's bringing as much speed in there as he can. Alright. - [Rut] A little too much speed? - [MH laughs] [hosts shouting] Whoa! [spotter] Oh my God! [MB] Lost control there, too fast. Get back in there. You're good. [Fielding] Hit it with the back of my car, right? [MH] Losing precious time, but he's going to try to clean it up. [MB] Yeah. [bang] [MH] Nice recovery. Nailed it. Over to Light Box. Go! [Rut] He is linking all of these challenges so beautifully. He's keeping the car moving forward while going sideways with as much power to the ground as he can. [Fielding] I think I... need to chill out. [laughs] Wait for the pattern. - [Fielding] Just two? - Yeah, just two. And they're diagonal. [MB] Pin it, buddy. [MH] Here he goes. Into that Light Box, doing that 540. [MB] God, it's just so beautiful to watch. [Rut] Nice and smooth. Nice job. Now it's diagonal. [MB] This is what he excels at. He's gonna make some of that time up here. [Rut] He'll bring that heat right in there. Oh, he almost clipped it coming in! [MH] Look at that. So close. [spotter] Nice and tidy. [MB] Look at that! [laughs] Unbelievable. [spotter] Nice job. - [MH] 2:05, going out of the Light Box. - [crowd cheers] Down to Walk on Water. Entrance is dry. Be careful though. [MH] You heard his spotter. Fielding, headed to Walk On Water. This is the obstacle that nearly ended this competition last run, so he covered his intake with a trash can to waterproof that engine, putting all his money in a dollar store fix! [MB] Oh! He brought way too much speed into that turn! [Fielding] I spun! [MB] Oh, man! [Fielding] See if that trash can works. [MB] Here we go! [splash]
