 [female announcer] Qualifier four, track is hot. [Alexandre, in French] Tonight might be my last race, my last chance. I'm going to give it all I have left, to finish in the top three. I've got a lot of fight in me. I'm going to do everything I can to really prove myself. It's not over yet. [Karolina] Being a woman in a male-dominated world I need to prove that I can do this. [Aaron] I'm a very competitive person

 and I do feel I can win the competition. I'm not scared at all. [Corinna] The pressure is higher now. It's my third race and it's time to go hard or go home. It's dangerous, don't do this at home. [Mike Hill] The final qualifying round is just moments away. And if you thought the competition and the courses were amazing so far, well, you ain't seen nothing yet. This is Hyperdrive, where the cars are fast, and the competition is furious. We have reached the final qualifier. Ten drivers will run the course, but only three spots are left in the top 12. That means the top three move on and the rest are done.

 We've already seen nine racers advance through the first three qualifiers, and that group will watch anxiously to see which drivers will dominate tonight's final qualifying course and join them in the quest for the Hyperdrive Championship. And don't blink, because this time we're testing reflexes. This one is going to be a shootout. Our final qualifying track features nine targets, scattered all across the course. Four of those targets are located at a brand new obstacle, Manji Alley. Manji is a Japanese drift term for swaying left and right while driving forward. Racers will have to do just that as they try to strike the four targets alternately placed on either side of the track. But of course, that does assume they've made it past our second new obstacle, Thread the Needle. Drivers will navigate through a triangle of three cargo containers, barely wider than their cars. It'll take a daredevil's approach to attack it at speed and risk damage. But success will also come from how aggressively drivers can execute a tight turn to get into the next one. [engine roars] [announcer] Driver one, prepare for launch. Track is hot. [Mike Hill] Alright fellas, here we go. Last chance to make it to the Knockout Rounds. And our first driver is making his way to the launch gate. You know that unique sound right there. That's Aaron Parker from California and that rotary motor. Fourth run for him, but will it be his final one? He was really disappointed after his last. [Rutledge Wood] He's made some costly mental mistakes in his previous races and he's yet to deliver a clean run. How does the car feel? Feels good, man. Feels good. - How do you feel? - I feel great. [Rut] He says he feels great. Let's hope that translates to the track, because this is Aaron's final chance to prove to himself, and his family back home, that he and his car have what it takes to be the Hyperdrive champion. [Aaron] Quartz Hill, California, it's a lot slower pace than, you know, Los Angeles, the glitz and glam and everything. Being a kid out here, I loved my childhood, I had a great upbringing. My mom was a nurse in the NICU and worked really hard to provide for us. She pushed me to be physically active quite a bit. I grew up riding BMX, fishing, I loved being outdoors. There were some lean times but there was always food, always care, and our family fostered about 40 kids, and adopted five of them. That's just kind of a testament to how big my mom's heart was. She was really giving, always cracking jokes, and taught me that the world is much larger than just one person. But two-and-a-half years ago, she got diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's and dementia. It kind of turned everything upside down. So now me and my sisters, we take care of five children that need that love, support and care. [laughter] I'm cooler than you. [sister] If we had to have one cool kid in the family... Dominick's in a band. [sister laughs] [Aaron] I work about four jobs, making sure that the lights stay on Kenny calls me and needs to go to the movies, or Dominic doesn't have any peanut butter. Everything that makes a family a family. At the same time, I'm doing everything I possibly can in order to make sure that this dream comes to fruition. There's a huge time commitment to it, and it's not cheap. It's not cheap at all. But I hope my younger adopted brothers and sisters can see what I'm going for, and take that drive and apply it to whatever they're passionate about. Every time I leave the start line at a race, every time I get into the car, I want to be something great. And I want my family to be proud of me. [rotary engine revs] Car sounds good. Feels good, guys. [MH] Aaron Parker from California. Last three races, he has been in the middle of the field. Tonight that will not be good enough. Let's send it down to Lindsay, who's with his spotter. David, as we know, there is no more safety net. It's gotta be top three or that's it. So how have you guys prepared for that? The car's feeling good. We gone over the course, we feel good about that. We're not worried, we're ready. Alright. Guys, they say they're ready. [engine revs] - [MH] Huh? Can't hear you. - What? [Michael Bisping] That's the loudest car I've ever heard. It makes my brain rattle! [Rut] This is my favorite car here. [Michael Bisping] I hate this car. [Rut] I'd take this in a heartbeat. Alright, Aaron. Top three, baby. Rodger that. Loud and clear. [David] You got it. [MH] We'll see if Aaron Parker from California, a man with a lot on the line, a guy who's thinking about his family at this moment now. He's gotta finish inside the top three. [engine revs] [tires squeal] [MH] Alright, here we go. He'll be tested right out of the gate with a double target set-up in Turn One. Can he start strong? - [bang] - [MH] Whoa! [crowd cheers] Off to a great start. [MH] Moving on to a brand new obstacle called "Thread the Needle." It's going to require precision driving through some very tight spaces. [MB] Three cargo containers, they're going to shoot through them, spin a 180 as fast as they can and then get through the other. [MH] Let's put him on the clock and see how fast he can get it done. Whoa! He got through, baby. [Rut] Guys, this is a lot harder than it looks, because you only have a couple of inches on either side. [MB] Aaron's taking this pretty slow. Perhaps worried about taking damage. He did rip off his bumper in Qualifier One, remember. [MH] But look at that. Whipping your car around quickly and getting in the next container is a big part of this, and he's doing a good job of that. What's next? Manji Alley, baby. [MH] Yeah, 25 seconds. I don't know how that'll hold up against the field, but it felt a little cautious, guys. Did I do it okay? [David] Good job, keep going. [MH] Here's Manji Alley. Now what's the key here? [Rut] Four alternating targets in a very quick sequence. There may be only a handful of our drivers who can pull this off. - [engine roars] - [bang] [MH] Barely hit the first target and a bit out of control. [Rut] He needs to regather himself for the second one. - [bang] - [MH] That's a penalty right there. [MB] Oh, come on! - [MH] There he goes. - [bang] - [MB] He's got it back. - [crowd cheers] [David] Good job. [Rut] So tough. Even an experienced drifter like Aaron only hit three of the four targets correctly, and he didn't exactly do it at speed. [MB] Definitely looks like Manji Alley is the make-or-break obstacle. - Head over to Forced Perspective, Aaron. - Got it, Dave. Thanks. [MH] Into the Forced Perspective now. This time around, drivers will go straight on through without stopping at the checkpoint. Here he comes. [engine revs] - [MB] Come on. - [announcer] Break Wall, 200. - 100. - [MB] Brave it up. [Rut] Got it. [MH] Clean, no penalties. [David] Good job, Aaron. Next up is the Leveler. Leveler? [David] Leveler. [MH] Not bad, not bad at all. Once again top three, you survive. Middle six not good enough tonight. Nice and clean. [MB] If he wants to stay in this tournament, he's got to go balls-out. He hasn't got the time to take his time. He can't be patient, he's falling behind, he's had penalties, he's really gotta go for it. - [MB] Get that foot down. - [Rut] Go! [engine roars] [Rut] He's attacking it with plenty of speed. [hosts shout in excitement] [MH] Nine feet from the edge. [Aaron] Come on. Go down. Let's go. No messing around. Come on. Coming down. [MH] Aaron knows he left some time on the first half of the course. But can he make up for it on the back stretch? Come on. - [David] You're heading to the target. - Roger that. [Rut] Every second from here to the end is absolutely precious. It is do-or-die for everyone tonight. [MB] Coming into the circle now with these three targets. He's got to nail this. This has to be perfect. If he messes this up, this could be the end. [MH] He's going to have to hit three targets in a row here. [MB] Here we go, it's all on the line here. - [smash] - There's one, perfect. Keep it going. [crowd groans] - [MB] There's two. - [MH] Go back, get the other one. - [MB] Buddy, you got this! - [MH] Get that other... - Here it is. - [smash] - [crowd cheers] - [MH] There we go. [David] You got it, get out of there. [MH] Aaron Parker, giving everything he's got. One last chance to make his dream come true as he speeds to the finish line. - Wow! - [crowd cheers] [Rut] He's got to feel good right now. There are a couple of things, maybe he could have done a little bit better, but he also knows if this is it, he's going out in style. [MB] He's definitely going out in style, looks like his car's going to blow up. [MH] Aaron Parker with a time of 5:37. But will it be enough? Tom Petty said that the waiting is the hardest part. I think he's right. [MB] That's right and we've got some tough competition coming up. Axel Francois, we got Karolina, Corinna, of course. Every time somebody drives, he's watching that car, thinking, "Please don't beat my time." [announcer] Track is hot. Driver Two, report to the start line. [MH] So one driver down, here on our final qualifying track. Once again, tonight's fastest three drivers will move on to the Knockout Rounds. But for the rest of the field, their competition is done. [announcer] Driver Two, report to the start line. [MH] First time we're going to see John Klarich out of San Diego, California, and I've got to admit, man, I am looking forward to this dude. Talk about adrenaline junkie. Full of confidence and my man hates to lose. [Rut] Not only that, he's a bit of an outlaw. John's exactly the type of guy you'd find wrenching in Dom Torretto's garage. [John] I've always been more of, like, the underground drifter getting in trouble with the cops. [tires squeal] I love going fast but I haven't been able to do it in like, legal areas, I guess you could say. One year alone, I got arrested like, 12 times. [tires squeal] I'm driving a stock Mustang, without an E-brake or anything. I'm a little crazy behind the wheel, and I tend to beat the crap out of the car. I just have some sort of aggression against the car, because I've almost died in that thing six times. You guys will see. [engine revs] [MH] John Klarich. Intense. [Rut] He convinced his friend to loan him this car that he's driving. A 2005 Mustang GT with only 400 horsepower, and not set up for drifting. I am already impressed. Guys, I can tell a lot by this stance. Elbow up on the top of the door panel. Left hand over there, about 10 o'clock. No gloves. [MB] I think he's a little bit crazy, a little bit dangerous, and I can't wait to see it. Okay, John, send it in and put on a great show. You've totally got this. Where's this [bleep] green light? [MH] He's ready to go. [Rut] That is angry. [MB] I am ready to see him. [crowd cheering] [engine revs] - [engine roars] - [MH] Let's go! [Rut] Here he goes, looking for those targets. We're gonna see everything we need to know right here. [bang] [everyone groans] [Rut] Oh, no, he's gonna whip it around. Remember he's doing all of this without an E-brake. That is so difficult, you guys. [MH] Doing a good job to recover. Nicely done. [bang] [MB] Not too bad, it could've been worse. Now you've got that 180 and Thread the Needle. [tires squeal] [MH] There he goes into Thread the Needle. Going into that first container. [Rut] Again, this obstacle is all about aggression through the containers, and how quickly you can spin it around to get in the next one. [MH] There he goes. [tires squeal] [Lora] Perfect. [MH] Klarich driving like a man possessed. Nine seconds faster than Aaron Parker. [MB] Now he's on to Manji Alley. We saw Aaron struggle a bit here. Does he have what it takes? - [bang] - [Rut] Bam. - [bang] - Bam! - Bam! - There it is. - [MB] Nice! - [crowd cheers] [Rut] Guys, for him to do that without an E-brake... I could count on my right hand how many other drivers can pull that off. [MH] Yeah, he smoked Aaron Parker there, but it looks like he hit that third target with the front of his car, a penalty. [MB] Who cares about a penalty? He just murdered Manji Alley. You're doing so good. Keep that [bleep] up. I got it. [MH] My man, John Klarich, driving like he stole it. $50 he doesn't slow down at Forced Perspective. [MB] He won't slow down. No way. [announcer] 300 feet to Break Wall. [Rut] Reaching for third gear? [Rut] He ain't slowing down. - [bang] - [everyone yells] [Rut] It's easy to be reckless when it's not your car. [MB] Reckless is a bit of an understatement. The cops are chasing you, go. [Rut] He is driving like the cops are chasing him. Unreal! [MB] He's whipping around these corners. [MH] He does not give a damn, and he's right on Aaron's heels heading into the Leveler. That five second penalty at Forced Perspective, the difference-maker right now. [Rut] Guys, imagine the pressure. It's his first time on the track, in the final qualifier, and it's his one and only chance to advance as part of the top 12. Here comes the fun part. Try to get that third light at your driver door. Yeah. - [bang] - [MH] Here we go. [MB] Takes his time. [Rut] He's actually slower than I thought he'd go, The Leveler is not a smart place to lay off the gas. He's nice and high up there though. [MH] Look at this. He is eating animal crackers right now, guys. [Rut] I think that's a little shout out to Han from Fast and Furious. [MB] It's making me hungry. I'm starving. [bang] [splash] [Lora] Alright, now get it. [MH] Here he comes. John Klarich coming off that Leveler, neck-and-neck with Aaron Parker's time right now. So if he can navigate Target Zone quickly, we could be looking at a new race leader. You gotta go in the Target Zone, there's three targets in there. [Rut] I would be afraid if I was one of these targets now. [MB] Yeah, he is gonna smash into them. [MH] Ooh, missed the first one and no good! This is not the clean Target Zone he needed. [Lora] Keep going. - [tires squeal] - [bang] [hosts yell in excitement] [MB] I hope his friend has good insurance. [MH, laughing] Get out of my way. Here we go. - [Rut] Oh! - [MB] Oh! [MH] Wasting valuable time. - [bang] - He got it. [Lora] Great, that's good. -[MH] He's got to go get that third one. - [bang] - [hosts cheer] [crowd cheering] [MB] I absolutely love this kid. [MH] Forget the paint job. [hosts] Oh! [Rut] He spun out getting out of there. That is full send right there. He's going... oh! [MB] This is not my car. I don't care. I'm gonna smash it to pieces. [MH] As he comes across the line, here on Hyperdrive. [MB] Wow. [MH] He was a bit wild through Target Zone. Definitely left some time out on the course. Eleven seconds behind Aaron Parker. We'll have to wait and see how competitive that is, but he definitely put on a show. [Rut] Guys, I am really impressed that an almost-stock Mustang could do that. That's impressive. [John] I tried to picture myself going down the course, getting chased by a stupid cop or something, but I didn't set the greatest time out there. It is what it is. I had my animal crackers and it was cool. Oh my God. That was so good. You did amazing. Great job out there. [MB] Not as fast as he would have liked. Second place so far, but a lot of tough drivers coming up. [announcer] Driver Three, report to the start line. [MH] On a night with no second chances, and eight more drivers waiting to seize their moment, the third racer to the line was returnee and crowd-favorite, Kansas City native, Tyrei Woodbury. [chanting] Panda! [Tyrei] I am a humble individual on a planet of seven billion people, that was, thanks to the alignment of the universe, chosen for such an awesome event. This is my opportunity to be a diamond. [MH] He shot out of the blocks, determined to survive the night and launch himself into the top 12. [bang] [Rut] He missed the target. Turn around. [MH] Although he missed the target at the turn one double... [MB] He's going back. [MH] ...and missed it again on his second try... [crowd groans] [MB] This is not how you start a do-or-die run. Make up time in Thread the Needle. [MH] ...he was flawless on the back half of the track. [hosts] Whoa! [MB] Out of Thread the Needle in just 17 seconds. Here he is at the Manji, making up time. There you go, buddy. - [cheers] - [MH] He got it! Tyrei Woodbury coming down the stretch after salvaging this run. [MB] Yes! [MH] His performance had given the Angry Panda a reason to smile. And with three runs on the board, it meant it was win or go home from there on out. John Klarich's time of 5:48 was the cut mark. Top three or nothing. The pressure was on. [announcer] Driver Four, report to the start line. [MH] In a cruel twist of fate, the next three drivers to the line were all facing their first look at the Hyperdrive track. [chanting] Hai! [engine revs] [MH] California street racer, Nate Galvez, former J-pop singer and model from Japan, Kisaragi Awano, and West Chicago's king of exotic cars, Omar Salaymeh. [Rut] It's simple. Beat that time of 5:48 or your Hyperdrive dream dies tonight. [MH] They would only have one shot to prove themselves. One chance to advance. [engine revs] - [Rut] Oh, listen to that! - [MB] Wow! [Rut] Ooh! [MH] Right out of the gate, Nate and Kisaragi's lack of experience was on display... - [Rut] Argh! - [MB] Missed that one. [MH] ...as their reflexes weren't sharp enough to strike the first targets. And the whip! [in Japanese] Forget it, just go ahead! [engine revs] [in Japanese] I can't reach it. [MH] And it was plain to see that the pressure of being a Hyperdrive rookie in the final qualifier was too much for these young drivers... It's just your headlight, don't worry about it. [MH] ...or their cars to handle. [MB] No. Oh, man! Wing hanging off the back, - headlight hanging off the front. - [bleep] [MH] But for Omar Salaymeh in his six-figure super-car, the story would be much different. This car, to slow down and kick it out, try to hit some of those targets, won't be easy. I'll do what I can. - [bump] - [Rut] Whoa! Did he just open the door? [MH] He just opened the door. - [MH] Is that legal? - Technically, it counts. I like it. [MH] He stuck with this shameless strategy through Manji Alley. That's going to cost a bit. [Rut] But there's the problem. He can't hit the targets when they're on the right side of the car. [MH] And though he racked up penalties, he didn't let up. - There's the door again! - You got it! [Rut] That's like the band Three Doors Down, right there. [MH] He strutted across the line with the result he was looking for. [MB] Look at that, the gallery is not happy. But like it or not, that run puts him in second place. I never thought I'd see a $150,000 car with the door open trying to hit a target. [MH] And that means the outlaw, John Klarich, has been eliminated. [John] I'm a bit disappointed, but I'm used to driving on the streets. So I'm going to go back, and let the cops know I'm back to have a little bit of fun, you know. How's it going? And yeah, you'll catch me out there. [MH] As drivers' dreams were being extinguished with every run, the Frenchman, Alexandre Claudin strapped into his Dodge Charger for his second and final chance to qualify. [tires squeal] - [MB] Here we go. - [bang] - [bangs] - [MB] That's how you do it. [MH] Through the early obstacles, he put together a nearly perfect run, defying expectations in his behemoth of a muscle car. [in French] Beautiful. [MB] Oh God, it's just so beautiful to watch. [MH] Oh! He is killing it. [Rut] Yeah! [MB] When you knew he was driving this, you thought he was crazy. You thought it was just too big to do this kind of thing. [Rut] It is! He's doing the impossible. [Rut] Wow! [MH] He made it! Amazing! Unbelievable. [MH] 3:24 and he's off to Leveler. Alexandre came off the Leveler with first place in his sights. [Rut] If he can ace this, he'll finish with the top time so far. [MB] There he goes. - [MH] Here we go. One target. - [bang] [Michael Bisping] Oh! [MH] Two targets. - [bang] - [MB] Yeah! Wow! [MH] He was hammer-down across the line in triumphant fashion. [MB] What a run! He's in first place. And in his celebration, showed he would not go gently into the night. [MB] Oh, hit those brakes. He's coming back. Easy, tiger. [MH] Nicely done. Listen to that thing. [crowd cheers] How about a little burnout for you, baby? [crowd cheers] [MB] Easy. [MH] Gotta love it. [Rut] Wow! What is he doing? [MH] He's going to pop a tire! [crowd cheers] [MH] Alright, let's take a look at our up-to-date leaderboard. Tyrei Woodbury's time in the top three was short-lived, but a memorable performance here on Hyperdrive. As it stands now, it's Alexandre Claudin, Aaron Parker, and the controversial Omar Salaymeh holding on to the top three spots. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver Eight, report to the start line. [MH] Alright, our next driver is Corinna Graff from Germany. She's one half of our husband-wife drifting duo Of course, her husband is already into the Knockout Rounds. Corinna came in saying she wanted to beat her husband. She's got to actually join him first. [Rut] Imagine the pressure you might feel traveling half way across the globe with your entire family. Kids in the gallery, watching. Husband is already into the top 12. That is some pressure that she's got to be feeling in that Mercedes right now. [engine revs] [Corinna] I come from Trochtelfingen. That's like the countryside of Germany. I live in a village, not so many people. [in German] Dinner will be ready in five minutes. [child] Okay. Everyday, I have my kids, my job, and I make the dinner for everyone. Day by day. I love my family, and I love my time with the family. But sometimes you need escape. [engine revs] When I sit behind the wheel, I'm not a mom. I'm not a wife. I don't think about my normal life. [crowd cheers] I'm Corinna, I'm a racer. [MH] Wow! [Corinna] It's cool to be a mom. I love that... [MH] Corinna Graff! [Corinna] ...but I'm a bad-ass Mom. [MH] Here she comes! [Corinna] I'm here to win the competition. I'm here to kick ass. [crowd cheers] [MH] I love that. Corinna Graff at the start line, knowing 5:44 is the time to beat to advance to the Top 12. Let's send it down to Lindsay who's with her spotter. Benny, you seem a little nervous. What's going on? I'm a little bit nervous. Now we we have to bring it. I know Corinna is one of those women that really excels under pressure. Yeah, she has a little bit of pressure, she wants to go to the Knockout Rounds really bad. Right now, it's just her against the track and we have to lay one down. We will see. [engine revs] [in German] Concentrate, It's happening now. [in German] I'll do my best, Benny. [MH] Corinna Graff, trying to join her husband, Alex in the final 12. [tires squeal] [engine roars] [MH] Look at that. Corinna tearing off the line, coming up on the first two targets. Can she hit them on her first attempt? - [bangs] - [hosts] Oh! - Yeah! - Wow! [MB] Wow. She flew through that. That was awesome. Yeah! You hit it! [Rut] Bringing so much speed into Thread the Needle. [MH] 180 barrel here, coming around. [in German] Line up steadily, then pull through. [MH] Threading the Needle. [MB] Went through that container a little bit slow for my liking, but that 180, that was nice and fast, making up time. That was absolutely perfect. [Rut] It's all about using that throttle to make sure you turn the car around, but don't use so much that you go too far past it and waste time coming back. [MH] Not making any mistakes. Not the fastest we've seen, but quicker than both Aaron and Omar. The guy she's chasing right now. Manji Alley! [MH] We've seen a lot of racers struggle with this new obstacle, but remember, Corinna is the Drift Beast. [bang] - [MH] One. - [MB] Yes. [tires squeal] [MH] Missed it. [crowd groans] [Rut] That Manji is so tough to know exactly where you are with those targets. [bang] But a beautiful recovery for the last two. [MH] That's gonna cost her a penalty, but she did gain some time on Omar. [MB] Take those ten seconds on the chin, put it behind you. [MH] She got three of the four targets. Absolutely. Coming up on Forced Perspective. Let's see if she can keep it clean here. Carrying a lot of speed. Here she goes. [announcer] 200, 100. [MH] She's through. Got it done. [in German] Super, awesome. Keep going. No errors. [Rut] Keeping all the speed possible as she heads over to the Leveler. [MH] Running a great race so far as she stops at the Leveler, waiting for the green. Fifteen seconds ahead of third as she heads up the Leveler. Here we go. [in German] Super, keep going. And now let it fly. - [MB] Come on. - [MH] You see right there, she brings it eight feet from the edge. Nicely done. Omar Salaymeh watching this one close now, and hoping his time of 5:44 can keep him in that qualifying spot. [Rut] The weight of these cars really does influence how quickly that Leveler gets down. She's made up time right there just from the drop. [MH] Here she goes. [MH] Making a push for the top three as she moves through the speed section and on to Target Zone. [in German] Wow! That will wake you up. [Benny] Here come doughnuts. [Rut] Look at her hanging out. This car has so much power and so much speed, she can really make up some time here. [MH] Rut, if she can ace these targets, she should maintain that qualifying pace. [MB] Come on, Corinna. Here it is. [MH] Coming in. [bang] [MB] Hold that drift, get that foot down. [Rut] Keep it pinned. Yeah, go! - [MH] Wow. - [MB] Amazing. [Rut] Yeah, baby. Talk about not giving up. [MB] Kicked out a bit. [Rut] She's swatting some bees in there. [MH] The time to beat is 5:44 and she's gonna crush it. - Yeah! - [crowd cheers] [MH] 5:15, putting her into second place, and a well-deserved celebration for the Drift Beast from Germany. [engine revs] [crowd cheers] Yeah! Woo! Wow! [MH] After Corinna's run, that means the door has officially closed on Omar Salaymeh. I ain't sure if the rest of the drivers will shed a tear after his controversial strategy tonight. [Corinna] Yeah! [MH] Aaron Parker has now moved into the dreaded third spot. He survived seven drivers so far, but will his time hold up through these last two runs? I hope I am finally in the top three. That was my goal. I'm a little bit worried because now Karolina's driving. And yeah, we will see. Fingers crossed. I will be in the top three. I must beat my husband in the Knockouts. [announcer] Track is hot. Prepare for launch. [MH] You see the pink car of Karolina Pilarczyk from Poland. One thing about Karolina is, you know she'll put on a show. She always puts on a show. Now tonight, of course, it's all about that third spot. Who knows? She might get one or two, but the third spot is what she needs. [Rut] And in this Nissan Silvia, she's got that big, super-charged V8. Question is, can she use it and will it help her? Woo-hoo! [Karolina] Before, when I was racing, I was just having fun. I was doing a lot of drifting so I was not concentrating on time. But now it's my last chance, I need to be in the first three. So I need to do my best, and be faster and win. [cheering] [MH] Karolina Pilarczyk, the queen of Europe. One last chance to qualify here. Go, baby! [laughs] [MH] If she can beat Aaron Parker's time of 5:37.4, she can keep those hopes alive. So it's all riding on this run. Here we go. Karolina Pilarczyk, first female drifter in Poland. Ready to go. - [spotter] Let's go! - [engine roars] Listen to that car roar. She's gotta hit these targets. - [MB] One, two. - [Rut] Yes! Gas! [Rut] On the rev limiter, all the way through first gear and second gear, she is flying. And I love pink. I love watching this car go round the track. [MH] Thread the Needle. [Rut] This Nissan's got a Rocket Bunny kit on it which makes it look like a vintage Datsun. It's not super-wide. She's going through Thread the Needle. That should allow her to attack these containers with more speed than some of these wider cars. Ooh, getting a little loose on that turn there. She's got to pick up a little speed, that was real close to that edge of the container there. [MB] See the way she whips that round. Made it look so easy. [Rut] Nicely done. [MH] She's out of Thread the Needle, three seconds faster than Aaron Parker. Coming up on Manji Alley, this can make or break her run. [Rut] Play it smart. [bang] [Rut] She is feeling that pressure, guys, and she is stepping up and delivering. Yes, there you go. [bang] [MB] Nailed it. [MH] Oh yeah, baby. Nicely done through Manji Alley. Four for four on those targets, no time penalties to this point, as she heads to Forced Perspective. Gas! Max! [MH] Not carrying quite as much speed as Corinna did, so you hear her spotter telling her to hit that gas. [Rut] This car has so much power. Shifting it into third! [MH] Here she comes. - [Rut] Got through, yes! - [MB] Perfect. [Rut] Boy, she is putting on a clinic. [MB] But one penalty could really cost her a space in the top three. [MH] As she makes her way over to the Leveler, it looks like she's picking up the pace, fellas. [MB] Look at that. Nice. [MH] Pulling into the checkpoint, Karolina Pilarczyk has put herself into a great spot, ahead of Aaron Parker and right on Corinna's heels, but we're also getting word that she may have taken a penalty at that last obstacle. [MB] Look at this here. Very close to that panel on Forced Perspective. Tiny bit. [Rut] The edge of a rim can make that much of a difference. [MB] That is five seconds right there. [MH] Yeah, with that penalty, Karolina loses seconds from her lead as she fires up the Leveler. Top three in her sights. And she's up, but a full 11 feet from the edge. She's going to have to really start pushing it now. [MB] She was playing it a little safe early on in this run, but that strategy won't cut it anymore. If she wants to finish in the top three, she's going to have to floor it. [MH] Waiting for it to balance out. [Karolina] Go. [in Polish] Drive! Go! [Rut] She'd been putting down such a great lap. She just has to keep this up with no mistakes. She does not wanna stuff it into one of those K-rails. [in Polish] All the gas now! Give it all the gas! [MH] Got to think it's all going to come down to Target Zone. [MB] Almost there. [hosts yell in shock] [MH] Spins out in the exact same corner she did last race. [MB] Just as I said that, she makes the mistake. [MH] Unreal. [MB] That cost her three, four seconds, maybe. [Rut] Now she's really got to execute here at Target Zone. [MH] These targets could be the deciding factor. [bang] [MB] Oh! She's crumbling, she's falling apart. The perfect lap. Two mistakes, one after the other. [MH] Alright, but she recovers quickly there. [in Polish] Good! Give it! - [MH] Here she comes. - [MB] It's close. [MH] Coming down the stretch, is her lead enough to overcome those mistakes? [MB] Come on. [MH] Just in time. - [bang] - Ooh! [MH] Ripping the runway right here on Hyperdrive. That run's good enough to put Karolina into third place, which means farewell to Aaron Parker. He's gonna be outside the top three. Still a great effort. [Rut] Guys, you can see the disappointment on his face. I tell you what, he has got a lot to be proud of, here at Hyperdrive. He just didn't have the car tonight. [Aaron] I really wanted to prove to my family that I can accomplish great things. Getting bumped out, I just feel a bit like I let everyone down. I just know it what I can be capable of. But I got a little taste of my dream, and hopefully this can blossom into something moving forward. That's the most important thing. [MH] For Karolina Pilarczyk, who now sits in the hot seat that is the third spot, the final run of the night will decide her fate. [Rut] One thing for sure, Karolina stepped up in the heat of that moment, and she put it all on the line. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver 12, report to the start line. [engine starts] [MH] Alright, here we go, fellas. Not only is this the final run of the night, but it's also the final run of the qualifiers. And who better to take that honor than the Frenchman, Axel Francois? It's impossible not to like Axel. I mean, the way that he drives, he brings so much energy to the track, gives it his all, each and every single time, but he's gotta bring it tonight. [Rut] Axel is an absolute madman. He told us his strategy was to finish in the middle six in every qualifier, so that he could see as many obstacles as possible. before moving on to the Knockout Rounds. It's a crazy, high risk approach because he's left himself no room for error tonight, and because, guys, his car is in really bad shape. You're ready, Axel? Yeah, I'm ready. Really ready. [MH] Just like you said, Rut, you can see that car is smoking. [Rut] That color smoke is coming from oil. So he's either got oil blow-by going by the rings there, or there's something going on with that turbo, but it does not sound as healthy as it did in the previous rounds. [Axel, in French] As of today, this human is still capable of pushing his limits further, but the machine has started to fatigue. I hope I don't have any issues, so I can finish in the top three. That's my goal tonight. [MH] And he's trying to get in with his fellow countryman, Alexandre Claudin, who currently sits in first place. He has guaranteed his spot in the top 12 with that finish, as has Corinna Graff in second place. Now Axel knows he's got to beat Karolina's time of 5:34 if he wants to stay in this competition. - [engine revs] - [crowd cheers] [MH] The lumberjack drifter. Will we see more of Axel Francois in this competition? [spotter, in French] Let's go! [MB] Yeah, buddy. Come on. Woo! - [MB] Nice. - [bang] - Nice! - [bang] [cheering] [MB] That was beautiful. [in French] Okay, perfect. 150 meters, then reverse start the container by the left. Turn around. [Rut] Doing the barrel turn. [spotter, in French] Then the container. [MB] Look at that, the fastest anybody's gone through Thread the Needle so far. [Rut] Almost jumping the car in there, did you see that? [MH] He has put it all the line here tonight once again. Trying to get into the Knockout Rounds. This man has no fear. Look at that. And he's out of Thread the Needle faster than anyone so far. Putting down a great run. [Rut] Now on to Manji Alley. Karolina aced this obstacle. Can Axel get through cleanly? - [tires squeal] - [bang] - [tires squeal] - [bang] [Rut] Bam. - Bam. - [MB] Ha ha! - [Rut] Boom, baby! - [MH] Yes, sir. [Rut] Oh! - [MB] Yeah! - [crowd cheers] [Rut] Yeah, buddy. [in French] In 50 meters, careful on the left. [MH] A perfect race so far. Can that car hold up, though? That's the big question. [MB] That was so good, took it at such speed. [in French] Left fast, then right 90. [MH] Coming up on Forced Perspective, Axel Francois putting down one heck of a lap. Going into the Forced Perspective, he is ten seconds ahead of the leader, Alexandre Claudin. [MB] Oh, that's good. [MH] Just got it through. Yes! Running the perfect race so far, just over two minutes. [MB] Last time, the tires were splaying out a bit, I thought those might catch him out, but all good. [MH] My man is smoking in more ways than one. [Michael Bisping] Whoa! [MH] 2:28 as he heads to the Leveler. [in French] This engine won't last long. [Rut] You heard him, Axel's concerned about his engine as he storms up the Leveler. [MH] Looks to be a lock for the top three, but he's got to be able to finish this run in order to get it. - [Axel] Lise? - Oui? - [in French] I love you. - Focus. [MH] Axel Francois. Can this car make it to the finish? - [boom] - Splash down. Just at 3:03 right now, as he's waiting for the green. [engine roars] [in French] Go! Right 90... There are three targets. [MH] Woo! [Rut] You guys notice, that smoke's getting a little stronger coming out of that exhaust. [MB] He's got about 90 seconds until he finishes... - [Rut] Oh! He just barely keeps it off that K-rail. [MH] He's really pushing his car to the limit down this back stretch. - [MH] Going for those targets now. - [Rut] This is where he really shines. [MH] Well, can the car hold on? [Rut] Get ready. - [bang] - There's one. [MB] Continuous loop. - [bang] - [MB] Two. - [MB] And three. - [MH] Boom! [Rut] Yeah, there we go. [MB] Very nice. [MH] Axel Francois with first place in his sights. Down the stretch. That car, he's giving it all he's got. [MB] He's done it. Number one! [crowd cheers] [MB] That is the fastest time. [MH] Wow! That's what I'm talking about. Under pressure. [Rut] Axel Francois calling his shot and delivering tonight. [MB] Incredible. Ten seconds ahead of Alexandre. [MH] So the two Frenchman are joined by Germany's Corinna Graff to round out the top three, and that means Karolina Pilarczyk, the queen of Europe, has been bumped to fourth place and will be on the outside looking in for the Knockout Rounds. [Karolina] I was fighting for this for many years. So I feel a little bit disappointed about my mistakes. I know that I can do better. But the truth is that I'm really excited to see the women driving in this competition, because they are so good. This is more important than winning. - [Lise, in French] What's burning, Axel? - [Axel] A bit of everything, the usual. Overheating. Because, go hard or go home. [MH] Guys, our top 12 is set, and now the competition really begins. Because it's about to get crazy. We're about to find out what these drivers are really made of. Six new tracks to test their skill... - [MH] Get it. - [MB] Wow! [crowd cheers] [MH] ...insane new obstacles to test their hearts... - [bang] - [engine revs] [MH] ...and for the first time, head-to-head racing will decide who goes home. [bang] [hosts yell in excitement] [MH] It's going to be an epic battle for survival that will blow you away. [bang] I broke something! [MH] The Knockout Rounds begin... [everyone yells] Oh! Holy sh... [MH] ...right now.
