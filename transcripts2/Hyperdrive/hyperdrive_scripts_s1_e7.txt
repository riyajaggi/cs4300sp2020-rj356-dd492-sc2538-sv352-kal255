 [Axel Francois in French] Racing cars is dangerous. To succeed, you must push your limits, but by pushing your limits, you're taking more risks. Each course I feel that there is danger. It's a risk for my car... it's a risk for me. But in competition, the goal is to push your limits. It's the man and the machine. [in English] It's hard, but I have to continue to go forward. [Mike Hill] We begin with the top 28 drivers from around the world, and now we are down to just eight.

 Eight of the planet's most brilliant drivers. The next race is just moments away, and the air here is thick with tension. At this point in Hyperdrive, any race can be your last, so these drivers will have to find another gear if they want to survive tonight. And just when you thought the competition couldn't get any harder, the track designers have found yet another way to level up the challenges. Tonight's course is as much a mental test as it is physical. We've upped the ante at every obstacle, including a tightened turning zone through the pylons at Supernova... a heart-stopping 540 spin at the Water Cannon...

 [spotter] Go! ...and fewer reflectors to find the hidden path through Walk on Water. But the real game-changer is our newest marquee feature, the Rail Slide. For the very first time, drivers will have to choose their path to the finish line. They can drive the long way home through the car killer, Walk on Water, or take a potentially perilous shortcut, and send their cars down two 80-foot rails over water. Metal beams, 80 feet of water. That sounds dangerous. Unfortunately though, someone's Hyperdrive dream will become a nightmare, as one of the elite eight will be eliminated after this race. Who will field the pitch? Let's find out right now. [female announcer] Track is hot. Driver one, prepare for launch. Good luck. [in Portuguese] Good luck, bro. Nice. [engine starts] [Mike Hill] Ah! You hear that familiar roar? That's the Sheriff, João Barion, in his custom 1965 Fastback. Rut, this guy was racing Formula Three when he was just 14 years old. He had to leave the sport when his family's business went under, but João's made a jaw-dropping comeback here at Hyperdrive, and he looks primed to make a run at the title. [Mike Bisping] Come on, Sheriff. Show 'em how it's done. [Rutledge Wood] That's right, Mike, he finished in first place last round, leap-frogging his Brazilian rival, Diego Higa, who had been dominating the field to that point. João's got the pedigree. His car looks unstoppable and his team is locked in. Nobody else is preparing for each and every race the way that these guys are. They've added a skid bar for this run to try and handle that Rail Slide. And after his performance in Knockout Two, I think you may just be looking at the new driver to beat. [João in Portuguese] When I decided to return to auto racing, in the beginning, many people doubted me. For me and my team, for Nando, there were days and months without sleep, just to be here. I'm here once again to fight for first place. - [engine revs] - [crowd cheers] [Mike Hill] João Barion. [hosts] Whoa! [Mike Hill, laughing] Listen to that bad boy, yes. [in Portuguese] Old bro, it's us, eh? Confident. It's us, bro, let's go! [Mike Hill] How will João handle being the new driver to beat? A guy with a lot to prove. Can he maintain that number one spot? [tires squeal] [Mike Hill] Let's go! Hit that corner, baby. Wow! Now headed to Supernova. Now he's seen this twice so far and not taken a penalty, but the space between these pylons has been tightened by almost a third. [announcer] Supernova engaged. [Rut] With the widest car here, he's going to have to get deep into the turning area to pull this off. [engine revs] [tires squeal] [hosts] Whoa! [in Portuguese] Nice, bro! Go! [Michael Bisping] You can see, as you said, it's tighter, it's smaller. He did it without getting a penalty, but it was so close. [MH] Listen to that car! [Rut] This is exactly the start he was looking for. The Sheriff wants to come out and send a message to the field with this run. [MH] João Barion, making his way around this track. He's got two targets coming up here next, and this one's all about that drift, baby. [MB] There he goes. Come on buddy, hit it. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! Look at that. [in Portuguese] That's it! Go, João! [MB] That's the way to do it. [Rut] Perfect, and look how much speed he's carrying to the next challenge. That is exactly how you draw it up. [MH] And the clock will stop here at the leveled-up Water Cannon. João will have seven seconds to perform one-and-a half turns around that barrel before the cannon unloads 1,400 gallons of water directly onto his car. [Rut] It is enough time to get your car in there and whip it around the barrel, but can you get out before you get hosed? [Nando in Portuguese] Go! [MH] Here comes the water. Can he get out? Here it comes. [Michael Bisping] Go! [Nando in Portuguese] Get out! - [hosts] Whoa! - [water splashing] - [MH] And he's out! - [engine revs] [Rutledge Wood] That was unbelievable. João shot off the line, used that hand brake to lock the wheels and start his spin, and just beat the water out in time. Couldn't have done it better than that. [in Portuguese] Go to the Leveler! [Rut] Now there's a serious test of nerves, because we've removed the next checkpoint, so drivers will not have a chance to reset before they race up the Leveler. [MH] Now João's been unable to solve the Leveler in each of the first two knockout rounds, but let's see if he can get it here tonight. [in Portuguese] Start going back, bro. Go back... There. Forward a little bit. [MH] Here we go. [Nando] That's good! Go back a little bit. Go back... [MB] Wow, that's moving fast. [Nando] Go more, man... [MB] João, what are you doing? You're gonna slide off. [MH] João really struggling here. Is the Leveler going to get the best of him again? [Nando in Portuguese] More. [MH] Time is ticking. [MB] Go forward. [in Portuguese] Go a little bit forward. Just a bit. [MB] Needs to back it up a touch. [MH] No, he's good. [crowd cheers] [Nando] Nice and easy. [MH] Seven, eight, nine... - Ten! He figured it out! - [crowd cheers] Nice! beautiful! [Rut] That is a big win for the Sheriff. He failed the Leveler in his last race, came back and nailed it with 23 seconds to spare. [MH] That is huge, as he goes to Walk on Water. Remember, a lot of these cars, the water has been a big detriment to them, and to make it more difficult this time around, there are less reflectors guiding the way on that hidden path. Here he comes. [Nando in Portuguese] Be careful of the water! - [splash] - [crowd groans] [MH] He's off the road! [Nando in Portuguese] Get out of there! [MB] Oh my God! [Rut] That's the deepest we've ever seen a car go into that pool. João's exposing his engine to a ton of water there. That could completely choke out his V8. Look at the steam just pouring out of those side pipes. [tires squeal] [MH] Oh, and he whiffs on the first two targets. [MB] Got that one, okay. - [bang] - [MH] Bam! [MB] Let's go, Sheriff! - [bang] - [MH] Bam, and bam! Nice! [in Portuguese] Perfect! let's go! [Rut] Guys, that engine's holding up. [MH] Now... is he going to choose to do the Rail Slide? And it's a huge decision, because if he doesn't take the rail, he'll have to go back through Walk on Water, where he almost just drowned. [Rut] This is a big risk either way. [MB] Look at this! [MH] They did modify the car for this obstacle. [MB] Oh! [bump] [Nando in Portuguese] That's it! Go, João! [engine revs] [hosts] Oh! [Rut] No way! [MB] There's something dangling there, guys. - [bump] - [Rut] And that does not look good. [João in Portuguese] Nando, the car's suspension is broken. [Nando] Everything is dragging underneath, but let's go! Control it, bro. Control it, slowly. [Rut] This is the risk you take on that Rail Slide. You put the car in danger, and now he's having some real steering issues. [in Portuguese] Turn, you [beep]! [MB] Coming down on the home straight. [Nando in Portuguese] Stay straight, João! You broke something. [MH] And here he comes. João, fighting that car down the back stretch. And yes! He just barely makes it across the line. [João in Portuguese] I think the suspension is broken. Let's see. [Nando] João, chill. Stop, let's see what happened. Go nice and easy to the pit and let's see. [MH] So João Barion turns in another monster performance. No penalties, but fellas, I'll tell you what. I think he's just happy he made it across the line with the way that run ended. [Rut] Listen, with that damage he took at Rail Slide, if he did break his suspension, I'm not sure his car is even going to be ready to go for the next race. [MH] Oh, my gosh. That kind of impact can royally mess up his car. [MB] Ah, man. Look at this. [MH] Alright, we've got one time on the board, here's how tonight's going to break down. The slowest two finishers will have to race again to stay alive on our head-to-head track. The name of the game in Knockout Three is, finish in the top six and automatically move on. [male announcer] Track is hot. He's sleeping. [MH] Our next racer is Corinna Graff. Who, as you can see, is putting her son to bed before her run. Hey, this competition has taken a toll on all the drivers, but having her family here gives Corinna strength behind the wheel. [Corinna] To drive the whole night, every night, this is the toughest thing that I do for racing, really. Go hard or go home, baby! But for me, without my family, I cannot concentrate, I'm thinking about them. And now here, I have my family with me and I think that's made me so good in this competition. [Mike Hill] Corinna Graff, with an excellent run right here! Yeah! [crowd cheers] [Corinna] It's nice to come out of the car and give my daughter a hug, or Pierre a kiss. We are here with family. That's the main part of our success. [engine revs] [crowd cheers] [MH] So here she is, Corinna Graff, the mother of two from Germany. See her husband Alex, cheering her on from the gallery. João just went out and crushed this course, even though his car took a beating. So how will the Drift Beast follow that performance? [in German] Take one more deep breath and then rock this. [engine revs] [MH] Here we go. [MB] I can't wait to see this. [engine revs] [Benny] Go! - [crowd cheers] - [MH] And she's off. [Benny] Up to the Supernova. [Rut] There we go. Bringing that speed. [MH] Headed over to Supernova. Corinna's been so impressive with that Mercedes throughout this entire competition. [MB] These cars aren't designed to be driven daily. Maybe once a month they would normally compete. So doing this track, doing Hyperdrive every single night is putting these cars under constant pressure. [announcer] Come on, Corinna. - [buzzer goes] - [crowd groans] [MB] Talking about constant pressure. [Rut] She started that Rockford turn way too early. Didn't wait for the Supernova to open up. [Benny in German] Too early. Two of them. It's all good. That's four seconds. No problem. Moving on. [Rut] But at least she didn't just bump 'em, she booted those things right out of there. [MB] If you're going to get a penalty, do it properly. [in German] Two targets on the left. [Rut] You have to bring in so much speed and keep the car at the perfect angle to knock both those targets. - [bang] - [MH] Oh yes! - [bang] - [Rut] Yeah, Corinna. [MH] No problem with the targets there. [MB] See the change of direction, mid-drift? That was beautiful. [MH] Now she's pulling up to the Water Cannon. [in German] When the light goes green, try and outrun the water if you can. Yeah, I will. [MH] That surface is still a bit wet, and that's a tight circle in there. [tires squeal] [Rut] She's taking it awfully slow, guys. [in German] It's seriously crap when it's wet! [Benny] Put it in gear! [hosts] Whoa! [Benny] Drive forward! [splash] [MB] Oh, my word! No way! She got all of that. [MH] That was a direct hit on top of Corinna's car. [girl] Oh, my God! [MB] Oh, jeez. [MH] Did it stall? [Lindsay Czarniak] We just lost programming. [MH] Something is not right. She's got her hazard lights on. [crowd groans in shock] [MB] Look at that, smashed to bits. [MH] Oh my gosh. [Rut] Wow! [Lindsay] Is she okay? [in German] I've got glass in my mouth... glass everywhere. I can't see a thing. [MB] Oh, man. What is going on? [Rut] The weight of all that water just pancaked the windshield. [MH] There's Corinna's husband Alex and their daughter. The safety team's stopping them there because the track is still hot. [Corinna] Inside, everything's broken. [man on radio] Corinna, we're gonna stop you there. Please return to the pit. [Rut] Guys, her windshield is broken but the car is running fine. She's exiting the racetrack, because she needs to be evaluated by our medical team. There is no way she can continue and it's not even safe enough. [Corinna spits out glass] [in German] Where is Alex? I cannot see anything. It's over. [MB] That's it, she's done? You can't go on if you can't see out the windshield. [MH] Look at this. Look at the reaction of the other drivers, seeing this. [MB] If you're watching as a viewer, you see that water, you're like, "Yeah, doesn't look that bad," but when you see it crash down, take out the windscreen on a good car like this, then you think, "Wow." [MH] Yeah, it shows you not just the difficulty of these obstacles out there, but just the danger that's out there as well. Oh, yeah. [MH] Wow. [MB] Oh no. [Corinna] I don't know. It feels... it's burning now. I'm going to have the ambulance come over, too. [MB] Something in her eye. Ah! [MH] See, she's... - Something's in her eye. - He's got to make sure she's safe, too. [Corinna] The other eye is okay. [MH] And you see Corinna being escorted to an ambulance there. So sad. Obviously, came all this way. Family's here, the kids are here. [MH] Wow. [MB] So sad. [ambulance siren wails] [MH] We'll definitely keep you up-to-date on her status as the news comes in. But due to safety concerns, course officials have removed the Water Cannon from the track for the remaining drivers. João Barion's run time has been adjusted accordingly, and as far as Corinna Graff, well, she takes a "Did Not Finish." Now there will still be a head-to-head elimination race later tonight, but it will now be the sixth and seventh place finishers who will have to battle it out. [announcer] Track is hot. Driver three, prepare for launch. [MH] The next drivers had to clear their heads and prepare to race in the wake of Corinna's unsettling accident. [engine revs] [Jacqueline] Papa? [MH] And as fate would have it, it was her husband who was first into the blocks. [Jacqueline] Papa? [in German] Is everything okay? Yeah. [Jacqueline] You must bring it home. Bring it home. You got this. [engine revs] [hosts] Let's go! [MH] No one would have blamed Alex Graff for losing some focus on the track. but in the true spirit of racing, the old lion had to put his wife out of his head and drive his race. [Alex in German] I was scared for my wife. Of course that affects a person. [bang] I hope everything's okay. [Jacqueline] Perfect! [Alex] This is racing. This is how it goes. You have to accept it, or just sit at home, on the couch and watch TV. [MH] With ice in his veins, he balanced the Leveler for the first time... - Nine... - [MB] Stay there! - [MH] Ten! He got it! - [crowd cheers] [MH] ...attacked the Rail Slide... - [bang] - [MH] Oh my God! [Rut] It's like skateboarding a car. [MB] That was awesome. [MH] ...and in the face of great adversity, delivered his most impressive run so far. [Alex in German] I had so much adrenaline inside me, because of what happened to Corinna, and a bit of fury as well, so I just clenched my teeth and drove faster. [MH] It was a tough act to follow for Atsushi Taniguchi... [in Japanese] Take a deep breath. [in Japanese] Alright! [MH] ...whose performance so far has been inconsistent. [Rut] There is no doubt he has the skill, but his results have been all over the map. [MB] Let's go! [MH] The Japanese drifter blitzed the course early... [MB] Perfect. [MH] ...looking like a wizard behind the wheel. - [MH] Ten! - [crowd screams] [Rut] There it is. You got it. We might be looking at our new leader. [Ken] Go! [MH] And the Drift Sensei's sorcery only continued from there... - [bang] - ...putting him just a Rail Slide away from taking over first place. - [bang] - [hosts] Oh! Yeah! [Atsushi in Japanese] Do you think we should try the Rail Slide? We don't have to, do we? Right, we won't try this time then. [Rut] He's headed back toward Walk on Water. [MB] He's going to wimp out. Atsushi, you are dead to me. [MH] Whether it was João's busted suspension or Corinna's accident that made him hesitate, Atsushi chose to take the long way home. [Rut] He's had a good run and now it looks like he'd rather just maintain his car than make a push for first. [MH] And that decision cost him... [crowd cheers] [MH] ...falling all the way from first to third place. Axel Francois and Sara Haro arrived at Knockout Three as two sides of the same coin. Axel's all-out driving approach had left his car exhausted, but his confidence high. [Rut] Axel may think he can win this competition, but how much more does this car have to give? [MH] While Sara Haro's guarded driving had kept her car in one piece, but her ego fractured. [Sarah] Yeah, I'm a bit overwhelmed but I'm trying to not worry about it, not think about all the things that could go wrong. You ready, Freddy? I'm ready. I'm just gonna try and focus on what I gotta do to stay here. [Mike Hill] Let's go! [MB] That car is ready to blow. [MH] Sarah struggled with the targets right out of the gate... - [tires squeal] - [bang] - [hosts] Oh! - Dammit. [MH] ...while Axel showed off his drifting prowess... [MB] Yes. - [bang] - [MH] Boom! There it is. [MB] So good. [MH] ...but at the leveled-up Walk on Water, Sara cruised perfectly through the hidden path... Nicely done. Sara Haro is super impressive. ...and amazingly, Axel stumbled in the water again... - [hosts groan] - [MB] No way! [MH] ...filling his car with steam for the third time in the competition. [in French] Can you see? I can't see anything. [MH] His failure to solve Walk on Water cost him dearly at Target Zone... I don't know if he has any power. [Rut] Sucked some water into the intake there. [MH] But unfortunately, Sara traced his steps... Ah, man. So close. [MH] ...missing targets and losing time. [MB] There it is, yeah! [Bun Bun] No, missed it. You know what? Screw you. [bang] [MH] Neck and neck with only one obstacle to go, they both decided to risk it all and ride the rail home. - [MH] Here he goes. - [MB] Let's do it, baby! [MH] Slide on down that rail. - [MB] Wow! - [Rut] You guys, look at that. Smoke it home. You got this. Go! - [bang] - [hosts] Whoa! Ooh! My God. - [Rut] She hit that pretty hard. - There you go, bring it home. [MH] And the two very different drivers... [hosts yell in excitement] [MH] ...raced across the line in sync... [hosts whoop in excitement] [Mike Hill laughs] ...just a tenth of a second apart in fourth and fifth place. [in French] It's amazing that she's still alive. She is still alive! [MH] Diego Higa pulled to the line, feeling the pressure... not because of Corinna, but because he wanted to make a statement after finishing in fourth place. in his previous run. [Diego in Portuguese] I'm anxious to get out there and start this race. I want to return to the top spot. Every time I compete, I want to show the world that I can be the best. [Rut] This guy wants to come out and put his foot back on the throat of his competition. [MH] And he's off. Oh! Let's go! The baby-faced assassin rose to the occasion and obliterated every obstacle in his path... [crowd cheers] [in Portuguese] Well done, big guy! [MH] Oh my gosh. - [bang] - This dude is incredible. - [MB] He made that look easy. - [Rut] Yeah! [MH] ...and unlike Atsushi, Diego made a statement to end his run... - [bang] - [hosts] Oh! [MB] Beautiful. [in Portuguese] Let's go! [MH] ...and roared across the finish line right where he wanted to be. - [MB] Wow! - [MH] Claiming that number one spot, baby. He had taken back his crown as the driver to beat. [in Portuguese] That's first place [bleep]! [MH] Looking at the latest leaderboard, Diego holds the top spot by a wide margin, and unfortunately for Sara Haro, who is sitting in sixth place as a result of Corinna's DNF, she will be going into that head-to-head race later tonight. But we've got some good news for you. [crowd cheers and claps] [MH] Corinna is back from the hospital and here with her family. [crowd clapping] [MH] We're told she's going to be okay, but certainly a scary moment for the Graffs. [in German] All is good. Yeah, all is good. Everything is okay. [announcer] Driver eight, report to the start line. Driver eight, prepare for launch. [engine starts] [MH] Brittany Williams came into Hyperdrive as one of the least experienced drivers in the field. We've watched her improve right before our eyes. With everything this competition has thrown at her, she's kept a positive attitude, and that's been the secret to her success. [Brittany] That's my drawing of Kevin. Actually, I was really pumped about this course. You have the Rail Slide, which is a completely new obstacle. Haven't really done many modifications for it other than the line of tape that I put on the hood to make sure that I'd line up well on the line on the first left railing there. Kevin and I had a bit of a disagreement as far as where this line up was, so we have a running bet now. I told him that if I fall off the Rail Slide, I will admit that I was wrong. If I line up well, it should go well. - [engine revs] - [crowd cheers] [Mike Hill] Brittany Williams, our final driver in Knockout Three. The time to beat is 5:45 if she wants to avoid that head-to-head. Axel Francois, currently sitting in that hot seat. So he'll be watching this one closely. Baby, good luck. You got this, this is all you. Alright, let's do this. [Lori] Alright, Brittany, let's go! Alright baby girl, let's do this. [engine revs] [tires squeal] [MH] Brittany Williams off the line and carrying good speed around that first turn. Good job. Easy. Alright, we got this. You got the Supernova. That's all you, babe. [MH] I love the communication between the spotter and driver. [Rut] Yeah, he's really good at reminding her, "Hey, here's what's next, this is what you do so well." [Kevin] There you go, you're perfect. - [MH] Spin it. - [hosts] Whoa! [MH] And she's through Supernova clean. [Rut] Guys, she's definitely seen that you can make mistakes going too hard, too fast, so she's trying to be conservative, but she's still making it work. [MH] Coming up on those two targets next, Brittany's been struggling with these in the knockout rounds, so let's see if she can turn it around here. Okay, clutch in, first gear, brake. - [MB] Come on, Britt. - [Rut] Here it is, yeah. [MB] Keep going. - Back up. - [Kevin] There you go, you got it. Wait. Turn. - Turn hard back. - [MB] Turn it. - [bang] - [Kevin] Alright, you got it. Go. [Lori whoops] [Rut] Still having trouble drifting through these targets, but a nice recovery. Backed up into it and avoided the penalty. [MH] And now she's skipping ahead to the Leveler, an obstacle she's had a lot of success with. [Rut] This is where she shines. Get it, girl. [engine roars] [MH] And it is imperative that she figures out this Leveler quickly, because she is the slowest driver so far getting to the Leveler on this course. [MB] But she can make that up if she can nail it on the first go. [MH] Trying to avoid going to that head-to-head. [Kevin] Back. Back. [MH] Axel solved the Leveler in his run, but it took him nearly the full 90 seconds. Brittany will make up time if she nails this. [Kevin] Go forward a little bit. - Forward? - No, stay. I'm sorry. Stay. Back. Just a little bit. Stop. Just a little bit. Back. Stop Back. Stop. Oh. - [MH] Oh, I think she got it. - Keep it there. Forward. Nice. [Kevin] Forward. - Oh! She got it! - [crowd cheers] [MH] Brittany Williams with 42 seconds to spare. [Brittany] Oh, God! We're so good at this, babe. [MH] Unbelievable. I may not be able to hit targets well, but we can level a bridge like pros. [MH] She went into that obstacle ten seconds behind the Frenchman, and coming out 20 seconds ahead. [Rut] And guys, Axel had a ton of trouble through Walk on Water and Target Zone. Brittany is in the driver's seat right now. Alright, it's your bread and butter. Easy. [MH] She's got to be feeling good right now. Flying through Walk on Water. [Rut] But the four targets on the other side are gonna be her toughest test yet. [MB] Alright, here we go. It's all on the line here. - [bang] - There's one. - Perfect. - [bang] [Kevin] Stay in it. - [bang] - [MH] There you go. [MB] You've got this. - [bang] - [crowd cheers] [MH] Who says Brittany can't hit targets? [MB] That had to feel good. I can't see out of my front window. [Kevin] Just do it, set it up. [Rut] Way ahead of Axel here, but she's going for the Rail Slide. This is a huge risk. Oh, God. - [bump] - [Brittany] Oh, God! [Kevin] Oh my God. - [gasps] - [crowd cheers] Holy [beep]! Wow. - [screams] - [crowd cheers] [whoops] I think I almost just died! [MH] Brittany Williams somehow survives the Rail Slide, and is going to survive to the next round. Hell, yeah! [beep] Woo! Listen to the excitement in her voice. The run didn't start out perfect, but it's going to end on a high note. [Kevin] Go! [MH] Brittany Williams does it again. She's in second place. [crowd cheers] Oh my God. [Rut] Bisping, did you see her on the Rail Slide? [MB] I kinda want to do that. It looked amazing. [laughs] [Rut] Guys, watch this. So there's a line painted there to let the drivers know, here's where the rail is. You got to get your tire on the other side of that. She put that little figurine on there, so she could line it up, and then I think she forgot. I mean, the entire middle point of the car on one rail, and boom. She got so lucky there. A couple feet earlier... [MB] I was just about to say, she would've gone overboard. We would've seen how good a swimmer she was, real quickly. What were you trying to do there? That wasn't a rail guide at all. Oh my God. I will admit on camera that Kevin was right, and the tape may have needed to be shifted over another inch or two. Oh, God! [gasps] Woo! So I'll admit that on camera, Kevin. You were right. I love you, I'm sorry. [MH] And with that insane ending, Brittany Williams takes over the second spot on the leaderboard. She continues to impress, and who knows how far she can go. At the bottom of the leaderboard, Axel Francois, now assuming he'll be joining Sara Haro in tonight's head-to-head elimination race, but we've got some news for you. Corinna Graff is not done yet. She's been medically cleared to race, and is going to try to finish her lap. [Rutledge Wood] Unreal. [MB] Incredible. - [MH] Wow. - [MB] Incredible. [crowd cheers] [Rut] The amount of bravery it takes to do what she's doing right now is off the charts. I mean, she got blasted with 1,400 gallons of water. It smashed her windshield, and she said, "You know what? Take it out, clean it out. Give me a helmet and let me keep going." The on-site pit crew from My Little Speed Shop was working furiously behind the scenes. Cleared out the windshield, cleaned out all the shards of glass, and now she's back out on the track. This is unreal. [in German] Very refreshing. [laughs] [announcer] Driver two, return to obstacle four. Driver two to obstacle four. [MH] Alright guys, because the racers who followed her skipped the Water Cannon and moved straight ahead to the Leveler, that's where Corinna will restart her run. We've added 15 seconds to her run time to compensate for getting between those obstacles, so Corinna is at 1:35, waiting for the green light. [applause] She'll need to beat Axel's time of 5:45.8 to avoid going into the head-to-head. [Rut] Corinna is neck-and-neck with the Frenchman to this point on the course. It's all going to come down to the back half of this run. [Benny in German] When we get to the Leveler, listen, tell me what you see. We'll go forward and back, get this thing balanced out quickly. Okay. [MH] Here we go. Corinna Graff. No windshield, no problem. Ready to restart her run. [MB] We all wanna go up, baby. [Rut] The Leveler has been Corinna's bread and butter so far, but she's never been under pressure like this before. [MH] And Axel did solve the Leveler, but it took him almost the full max time. Let's see if Corinna can deliver. Unless she can figure it out like she's been figuring it out, it's likely headed to the head-to-head. [Rut] Come on, Corinna, you can do this. [MB] This is looking good. [MH] Look at that. [MB] I have a good feeling. [Benny] A bit forward. [MB] I have a bad feeling. [in German] It's so sensitive. Benny, trust me here please. Keep fighting. [MH] Corinna, taking the reins, here. She's going to do this on her own. [Rut] She's so good at anticipating where this thing's going. - I have a feeling she shouldn't move. - Come on. Don't move. Don't go backwards! [Rut] She's so good. Come on. Get it. - [crowd cheers] - [Rut] And she got it! [MH] Corinna Graff solves the Leveler again. [MB] That is how you do it. [Rut] My heart is racing right now. - [Corinna, in German] Good, yeah? - [Benny] Under a minute! Perfect. [splash] [MH] Corinna Graff slays the dragon in under a minute, and has vaulted her ahead of Axel. [Rut] But guys, now she's got to drive the rest of this course at high-speed with no windshield. There's still three tough challenges remaining. This is not over. [MB] I'm just curious as to what's going to happen on the Walk on Water. You know why? Zwiebel schwitzen, nonexisten. [MH] She'll have to be careful here without that windshield. [in German] Think, don't hurt the rest of your race. [Rut] Trying to go easy here. There's a lot of electronics right in front of her that she doesn't want to get wet. [MH] Well, we saw Axel lose time through the water and into Target Zone, so Corinna just has to be solid now. [Rut] Come on, Corinna. - [tires squeal] - [hosts groan] [in German] Crap! [MH] Spins out and misses the target. [tires squeal] [MB] No! [MH] Another miss, losing a ton of time here. [Rut] A little deeper. - [bang] - [MB] Yes, one... - [bang] - two... - [Rut] Here it is. - [MH] Bam, nice. [MB] One more, come on Corinna. - [bang] - [MH] Yeah, there you go. She's only got 45 seconds to catch Axel, and may need take the Rail Side now. [Rut] If she's brave enough to do the Rail Slide... [MB] She's going to Rail Slide. Oh, my gosh! - She is going to slide down the rail. - She is going to Rail Slide. [Rut] No windshield. This is so hardcore. [thud] [crowd groans in excitement] [whoosh] [crowd cheers] [in German] Yes! [cheering] [MB] Nailed it. She is so much tougher than either of you right now! I can't believe it. [MH] Here she comes. Around the final stretch. Only 20 seconds to spare. From the hospital, back to the raceway. punching that gas with no fear in her heart. [MH] Corinna Graff, here she comes... Her windshield may have been shattered, but not her dreams. [Rut] She just waved out the windshield at us. [hosts laugh] [Rut] Are you kidding me? [MH] She is a German goddess. [Rut] Lederhosen! [crowd cheers] - [MB] Wunderbar! - [Rut] Biergarden! [MB] Wiener schnitzel. [Rut] I don't know any other German words. [Rut] She's safe. She doesn't have to go to a head-to-head battle with no windshield. [MH] Talk about an inspirational performance by the Drift Beast from Germany. [Alex, in German] Well done. [talking in German] [MH] Another incredible night of driving on Hyperdrive, and guess what? It ain't over yet, because we got the head-to-head between Axel, who's car will race again, and Sara. Two excellent competitors, here on Hyperdrive, but only one can advance to the next round, so it's or win go home. [spotter] Alright, just two minutes. [engine starts] [announcer] Drivers to the start line, track is hot. [Sara] Axel is a really good driver. He just goes for it and doesn't care if his car blows up or whatever. That would probably be my weakness, because I'm cautious of my vehicle, but hopefully I'll be fast enough, control the targets enough, and everything over the rest of the course to make up for it. [Axel in French] Listen, my car is very lightweight. Very malleable. I've trained it for stuff like this. As the saying goes, may the best win. I wish her good luck. It's starting to get hot in here. I hope I will be allowed to keep racing. It's going to be okay. Get ready. Are you ready? I'm ready. [howls] [engines rev] [MH] Alright, who's it going to be, Axel or Sara? [tires squeal] [Rut] Oh, there goes. [MH] Axel off to a good start, with Sara right there with him into that first turn. - [tires squeal] - [MH] Oh! She overcooks it! [Rut] Axel nails the targets so good on those drifts. [MB] Come on, Sara. [MH] That'll be a five-second penalty. - [MB] Axel's through. - [MH] Through that container, yes. Sara's got to make up some big ground. [Rut] She's struggled with these targets all competition. Axel has not. [MB] Sara, come on. [MH] Another penalty, and now she's got to pray Axel makes a mistake at the barrel turn. - [MB] There it is. - [MH] Unbelievable, but the Frenchman refuses to surrender his lead, and it's going to be bon voyage to Sara Haro. [crowd cheers] [MB] You know, to be fair, Axel has so much more experience, and on such a small race, so short in time, Axel was always the favorite. [Rut] Ah. So crushing for Sara, though. She was able to really go outside of her abilities at so many different points through her Hyperdrive experience. Unfortunately, it's time for her to end her Hyperdrive dreams. Congratulations. [in French] Thank you. [claps] [Sara] I'm very proud of myself. I never thought that little girl from Sweden/Florida truck-driver-chick would be here racing against these amazing racers from all over the world. Like, it's an experience I can't even begin to describe. It shows me that I can reach my goals. You just got to go for it and not be scared of it. [MH] Well, the Cinderella story comes to an end, and Sara Haro pulls up short in the head-to-head. But if she's this good this young then there will surely be a sequel, so keep on truckin', Sara. The winner, Axel Franxois, has now competed in every race but one. What's next for the super seven? Brittany Williams rode one rail down the Rail Slide, and Corinna Graff finished a race without a windshield, but the biggest surprise of all is coming up next time, so make sure you keep on watching.
