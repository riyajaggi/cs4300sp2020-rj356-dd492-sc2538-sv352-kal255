 [CHIMING] DOTTY: I just love Munich. This is really amazing. This is what winning contests is all about. Oh, well, Mother, you really should have won. You enter every contest the grocery store has. I know. Plus 15 sweepstakes, don't forget. No luck. You walk in, you buy one can of coffee... and do you imagine, you have the winning ticket. AMANDA: Oh, it is fun, isn't it? - You watch, this time he's gonna lose. - No, he's not.

 We've been here in Germany for four days and the same thing always happens. Look! See? The knight fell. DOTTY: The Glockenspiel is so beautiful. AMANDA: Oh, yes, Mother, I just love the Glockenspiel. [CUCKOOS] - They look real. - So are the stores. - Mother. Mother. - Let's go shopping. - Come on. Let's go. Come on. - I don't... Philip. Philip. Come here. If we go shopping one more time with your grandmother... we'll come back here tomorrow. - Okay. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh. Let's go to the market area which is the Valka... The Valkay...

 Let me see it. - It's number 10 on your tour map. - Uh-huh. How do you pronounce this? Let's pronounce it "number 10 on the tour map," Mother. Amanda, I counted every little coffee bean... - in that can. - You did? - Do you know what your lucky number is? - No, what? One thousand six hundred and thirty-eight. I'd always kind of hoped my lucky number would be seven. Amanda, it was more than luck when you picked out that coffee can. I mean, that was intuition. Your grandmother had the same thing. A special touch. - Mother. - You are very blessed. That's very sweet of you... but I just happened to pick up the right coffee can at the right time. Well, I'm glad because here we are in Germany. - Yup. - Come on, sweetie. AMANDA: Uh... - Amanda, what is it? - Nothing, Mother. I just, uh... Oh, look. Well, I just thought I saw somebody that I know, but I... That happens all the time when you travel. It's silly. Mother! PHILIP: You know what I miss most? Hamburgers. JAMIE: And milk shakes. - Fries. - Yeah. Don't worry about them, they are having a wonderful time. If we get separated, go straight back to the hotel. Don't wander all over Munich by yourselves. And wait for me! [SHRIEKS] [CHUCKLES] - Can't you ever just say hello? - Hello. What are you doing here? Be at the Friedensengel in one hour. Alone. Be sure to bring a camera. You're a tourist. - The Frieden what? - Friedensengel. Angel of peace. Tall, gold statue. Tall, gold statue. Right. Number 11. Right. Number 11 in my book. Number 11 in my book. Uh, the...? Lee? Mother. AMANDA: Ah. Look, if anyone should come too near, just be yourself. - You're a tourist. - Yes. Amanda, we need you for one simple assignment. Oh, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm on vacation with Mother and the boys. - Uh, not really. - Yes, really. I won a trip. - No, you didn't. - I did. No, the contest was rigged. We wanted you to win. Billy set it all up. - You mean I'm not blessed? - You're not what? Mother said that I had a special... Never mind. Well, it's just that, you know, I was so excited about it. I mean, I've never won anything before. Look, this could be a simple conversation. Why don't I talk and you listen? - I don't think I like this. - What? I think that by now you should probably trust me. You should've told me I was coming to Europe on assignment. Would've been simple, fair and honest. The simple thing to do is not to tell you anything more than you need to know. That way there are no suspicious moves on your part and no mistakes. I don't want you getting yourself into trouble, okay? - I'll just be a tourist. - Good, good. Now, a man will be contacting you with a message. Just bring that message to me. - That's all? - Yeah. We got a free trip to Europe for that? The man who is contacting you with the message is Hadfield Kemp. - You might remember him as Haddy Kemp. - Haddy Kemp. - Yes. - He was a student radical in the '60s. Uh, one and the same. Yeah. I heard one of his speeches once. Very serious. Lee, I don't think he has much of a sense of humor. He's still on the wanted list back in the States. He's been in Europe for 15 years with a ruthless terrorist group. AMANDA: And you're gonna arrest him? LEE: No. No. He's contacted the agency and wants to come home. It's our job to get him back. Why would you wanna get a person like that back? Well, Amanda, we're making a trade here. See, he's bringing with him some vital information on this terrorist organization... the Riebaden Group. They're not fun people, believe me. They're threatening widespread violence... if the U.S.-Western European trade pact is ratified. Ha. This kind of sounds like a job for Francine. Don't worry. You're not in danger from Haddy. He's a speechmaker, not a bomb-thrower. A terrorist would smell an agent in a second. But not a tourist. What about a nervous tourist? Look, everything is set. München Brauhaus Beer Garden tonight. Haddy will not contact you unless he feels safe. This key unlocks the door to an exclusive beer stein collection... where each member has his own private stein. Also has a code number to a special mug which you must use. This is how Haddy will know who to approach. Now, any questions? What in the world am I gonna tell my mother? Be inventive. It'll be interesting to see how Countess Robeskya gets along... with this avant-garde filmmaker Hellerstadt. They despise each other. Nice. You put flowers in this? This... is artistry from the Ming dynasty. If you drop it, Ortiz... you'll be old and gray by the time you pay it off. My orders were clear. Never meet here in the presence of others. - This couldn't wait. - It's Haddy. He's getting a little edgy. He's abandoning our cause. I can feel it. He knows too much. Maybe we should kill him now. You never understood the virtue of patience, my dear. The plan remains intact. Haddy will perform the assassination of the American as intended. Then I, as a loyal citizen, will kill Haddy. And to the world we can say... that our Riebaden organization will have a new brave martyr for the cause. I still want you to follow Haddy closely, though. And if Haddy goes to the other side before your great plan? Well, then, Christmas comes early for you, my dear Inga. Kill him. LEE: Haddy will be here any minute. Remember your code words and get your stein. Where is it? [POLKA MUSIC PLAYING] BARTENDER: Do you want a beer? - Ja, ja. In this, ja? Careful. Ha, ha. AMANDA: Thank you. [AMANDA GASPS] Oh, I'm so sor... Oh, I'm so sorry. Would you please, please sit down? I'm trying, I really am. [GROANS] MAN: Cheers. - Oh, cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. This music's not exactly Bob Dylan, is it? I like the Beatles more. Yeah. Especially The White Album. - That number, "Happiness..." - "Is a Warm Gun." You really are a tourist. Yes, I really am. I'm here with my mother and my two boys. I don't mean here, they're not "here" here. They're back at the hotel, the Hilton. I am a tourist. - Would you like some beer? - No, I can't stand the stuff. The agency's gotta get me out quickly, before I'm forced to kill someone. Forced? To kill someone? HADDY: I'm not into that stuff. But the Riebaden gang has drawn up a hit list of prominent Americans. I don't know who's on it, but I know I've been elected to complete the first hit. Can't you say no? I've been doing a tap dance with these crazies for 15 years. Up till now, I've managed to avoid their violence. If I don't go through with this now, they'll kill me. For disloyalty, you know? These people play for keeps over here. Who are you supposed to kill? HADDY: I won't know till just before. That way I can't warn anyone or back out. All I know is it's an American, here in Munich... 48 hours, when the night falls. Well, I can see why you'd want to leave. There's another reason. I've just learned I have a son. He's 7 years old, I've never seen him before. I met his mother over here. I didn't even know we had a child. And now I've just been told she's been killed in a car accident back in the States. He's gonna need somebody. I'm his father. - Well, I... - People can change, you know. Sometimes even for the better. Give me the agency's answer tomorrow. Ten o'clock. St. George's Church. AMANDA: St. George's Church. Ten o'clock tomorrow. Yes. Do you happen to know what number that is in my...? - Why don't we, uh...? - Now, which way do we go? Boys! Let's go... I'm sorry. Let's, uh... Would this...? Mom, can we go swimming in the hotel pool now? - Yeah, it's hot. - Okay. - What do you say, Mother? - Yes. - Would you take them back? - I'll take them. I'm gonna get a few more pictures. I'll be right back. - Let me have this. - Bags. - Thank you, sweetie. - Wait a minute. You got my bags. Stay with your grandmother. Stay together. Goodbye. - Love you. - Be careful. Stay with your grandmother. DOTTY: Wait a minute, wait a minute, we're gonna take the subway over here. How'd your little meeting with Haddy go? - Oh, it was very sad. - Sad? Why? Did you know he has a little boy he has never seen? And that the boy's mother was killed in an automobile accident? It's one of the reasons he wants to go home. - I'd say that's a damn good reason. - Yeah. Did he tell you anything else? We've gotta get him out of Munich. He's in a lot of trouble. I know that. Now, look, we're supposed to meet Billy and Francine. - Then you can brief us all at once. - Check. Now, listen, Lee... I'm sorry about the beer I spilled on you. I don't think it'll stain. But if it does... Some people say that you can use beer to get a stain out. - I don't know if it's an old wives' tale. - Amanda, please. - It's not important. - Right. - Meet me at the Arkaden in two hours. - The what? Number 22 in your map book. - Number 22. Number 22 in two hours. - The map book. Easy to remember. Number 22 in two hours. BILLY: If what you're saying is true, Amanda, then the clock is really ticking. Not only do we have to get Haddy out, now we have an assassination to stop... and we don't know who's going to be assassinated. - Mr. Kemp seemed very nervous. - I wonder why. I think the two people that he greeted were some of the terrorists. Well, that's your department, Scarecrow. Francine, compile a list of all prominent Americans... who might be in Munich in 48 hours. This could change our priorities. Can't you just stop these terrorists? Now, why didn't we think of that? The trouble is, Amanda, nobody knows who's in the Riebaden Group. It's not a large group, there's about 30 members spread all over Europe. - But they attack in small groups. - And they're totally ruthless. They could kill Mr. Kemp and he would never see his boy... and that would be just awful. We'll still get Haddy Kemp out of this country as planned. Now, I'm arranging for a United States Army transport plane to be put on standby alert. - That leaves just you, Amanda. - Yes, sir. This makes things quite a bit different, doesn't it? Hey, Amanda, your part in this is still safe. Deliver the second message and continue to act like a tourist. Because they would never do anything to hurt a tourist, would they? No. No, they wouldn't. [SIGHS] Right. [CHIMING] [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] Don't turn around. Someone might be watching. [WHISPERING] In a church? They blew up four churches last year. Oh, my gosh. What's the agency's answer? They'll take you out tomorrow by Army transport. - That's funny. - No, no, it's the best way. No, I believe you. It's just ironic. All those times I've protested against the Army... and now they're gonna save my hide. Do you have any further information about the intended assassination victim? No, no. If they could postpone getting me out of here by a couple of days... I might be able to come up with something. I could call it a way for making up for past mistakes. No, you can't wait. They might kill you and you have valuable information. Yeah. I know. Tell the agency Emmeramsmühle in Bogenhausen... tomorrow, 10:00. Right. Your son can be very proud of you. You're a very brave man. Mr. Kemp, are you there? LEE: He's gone, Amanda. - Thank you, Father. - You were up there? - Yes. You were up there? - Is it all set? - Yes. - Um, tomorrow at the Emmerams... - Emmeramsmühle. In Bogenhausen at 10:00. - Good. - Yes. Billy's got the plane all arranged. So I guess you can go back to the hotel and have a happy vacation. Will you take it from here? Yes, Amanda, I will take it from here. - I'm doing what I do. - Right. [WOMAN SPEAKS IN GERMAN] [LEE SPEAKS IN GERMAN] What did she say? - She wants me to hear her confession. - You wouldn't! No, I wouldn't. But it might be pretty interesting. [FLUTE BEING PLAYED NEARBY] Now I know I'm right. She's the one that was with Haddy at the beer hall. We should notify the baron. She must be Haddy's contact. How would you like that thing sticking out of your ear? There is something wrong with someone who doesn't like music. - We'll kill her now. - No! Not without the baron's permission. We'll kill her first and get the baron's permission later. It's all right, it's all right. AMANDA: The duchess and the ambassador got married... even though they hated each other? BARON: Oh, yes. I've never seen two people despise each other more. AMANDA: You were telling me about their wedding toast. So, what happened? Well, ha, ha, so the duchess pulled the ambassador's belt off... and poured the rest of her champagne down the inside of his pants. I guess that did sort of put a damper on things. To say the least, Amanda. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Oh, thank you. - I may call you Amanda? - Oh, yes, please. You see, we've had a terrible problem with teenagers and drunk driving lately. But enough of this talk. I'm having a little soirée tonight, it's for charity. Black tie. I would like you to come. Oh, well, thank you very much, I... There'll be other Americans there too. Oh. Well, I'm here with my mother and my two boys. Philip's 10, but Jamie's only 8, so I really should see what they're doing. Well, I just hope you can make it. Here's my address. Oh, thank you. The bone structure in your face is most beautiful. Lint. Amanda, goodbye. Bye. LEE: We don't have much time. Lee, it scares me when you come around like that. Who was that guy? He's a baron. His name is Klaus von Eiger. Oh, Klaus von Eiger? Yeah, I've heard of him. He's a playboy type. All right, what did he tell you? Well, uh, he told me that the bone structure in my face is lovely. Oh. Well, that's real vital information. Anything else? Well, he did tell me that he's having a little soirée at his home tonight... and he invited me. He said that there will be other Americans there too. Good, good. We'll have to find out who they are. - Amanda, you've gotta be more careful. - You saw the accident? Accident? Yeah. Yeah, I saw it. I was too far away to do anything about it, though. But you were worried? - Well, unofficially, yes. - Sure. I was hoping you'd run a little faster. I was hoping I could run a little faster too but I don't have my running shoes on. The people that tried to run you down were pros. You mean you think they were trying to kill me? Maybe they saw you with Haddy, I don't know. - Does this mean I'm in trouble? - No. No, you're not in trouble. That is why we are here. - Okay? - Right. Billy and Francine are waiting for an update. No, no. I should get back to Mother and the boys. Don't worry, they couldn't be better. Believe me. You're looking after them and you're looking after me. Come on. AMANDA: I got it, thank you. - Okay. BARON: Stupid! Your pathetic attempt on Mrs. King made me sick to my stomach. I can't believe I've associated myself up with the likes of you. If I hadn't suspected your stupidity, I wouldn't have followed you two all day. I knew you'd try something ridiculous. But she met Haddy at the beer hall and then at the church. She could be jeopardizing our operation. I know that. What I'm really surprised at is you, Ortiz. - Why did the hell did you let her do it? - I'm not sure. Well, that is a reassuring answer. Why don't we kill both? The King woman and Haddy. Because, my dear Inga, I want her to come to my soirée tonight. We'll deal with her there. As to our friend Haddy... he's gone underground after your botched attempt to kill Mrs. King. And now you are going to find him. Either you find him... or I'll find you. AMANDA: The Nymphenburg Castle. I'll have to bring Mother and the boys here. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. - You hardly even looked at it. LEE: Huh? Oh, I, uh... I spent the summer here once. - At the castle? - Yeah. Doing what? I know. I guess I don't want to know. LEE: Billy? What's up? FRANCINE: Matthew Hearns will be at the party tonight. Oh, the symphony conductor. BILLY: Except he left his baton at home. He's traveling Europe as a goodwill ambassador. He's not the only prominent American in Munich right now. - Randolph Benton... - Aide to the president. Right... is also in Munich. And... Uh, Jason Styron, the playwright. - Well, I read about it. BILLY: All right, listen up, people. There's gonna be an attempted assassination sometime tomorrow. Possibly before nightfall. That's the only clue we have. And Haddy is still in danger. We don't have much time to get him out. Yes, and let's not forget that he does have a little boy waiting for him. None of us are forgetting that. Well, I'm sure we're not, but I just wanted to remind us... because family is very important. All right, we're gonna have to cover all the bases we have here. Scarecrow, you and Amanda go to the baron's party. Keep an eye on Matthew Hearns. I'll cover Randolph Benton... and, Francine, you stay close to Jason Styron. Any questions? I have a problem. I can't go to the party. - Why not? - Well, I assume it's black tie and I... - You didn't bring a gown. AMANDA: No, sir, I didn't. How can you come to Europe without a gown? - Well, I didn't expect to meet a baron. LEE: Uh... You see, I didn't know that I was here on agency business. If I had known I was here on agency business... I probably would have brought a gown, but I... Well, it's okay because I'm here on business and I brought a gown. Uh, it's a good thing, huh? Because I'm ready for anything. It is a good thing too, because you're going to lend your gown to Amanda. FRANCINE: I don't think that's a good idea. It's an original. I mean, this is three months' salary and besides, it wouldn't fit Amanda at all. - Yes, sir, I really... BILLY: Nonsense. A few nips and tucks and it'll fit fine. Amanda will take good care of it, won't you? Yes, sir. [MAN SPEAKING IN GERMAN ON TV] DOTTY: Who did you say the friend was that lent you that wild outfit? Oh, uh, I didn't, Mother. Was this the friend from home that you met in Munich? Well, uh, she's not a close friend. You see? First you meet a businessman friend... then you meet a friend that lends you a wild outfit... and then you meet a baron. Ha, ha. You do have the touch, Amanda. Your grandmother, she met a lot of men. Well... Mom, can we go see the Glockenspiel tomorrow again? - You wanna see it again tomorrow? - Yeah! We can see it again tomorrow. I'll fix this for you tomorrow, sweetheart. Good night. Give me a kiss. Look, I wanna tell you something. I am very lucky to have you both. And I love you very, very much. Ma? How come you're getting so mushy? That isn't mushy. This is mushy! Amanda, can I ask you something? Do you think that they have stamps this late at night? Mother! You're writing Beatrice Norton? I thought you couldn't stand Beatrice Norton. You're right. I can't. That is why I'm writing her, telling her that I won a contest... sending my whole family to Munich. That's why I'm doing it. She'll be so terribly jealous. I mean, you don't mind if I tell a little white lie and say that I won the contest? No, Mother. I'm also telling her that you're engaged to a baron. - Mother! - All right. All right. Just dating a baron. Of course. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, fellas! BOYS: Good night. - Don't lose Beatrice's card. [BAND PLAYING PACHELBEL'S "CANON IN D"] Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. BARON: Amanda. - Hello. - You look enchanting. - Oh, how wonderful to see you, baron. Uh, Baron Klaus von Eiger, uh, this is my friend Lee Stetson. He's a businessman from America. BARON: How do you do? - Nice to meet you. Quite a beautiful home you have. How nice of you to say, Mr. Stetson. You must see my collection of antique vases. AMANDA: Oh. I traded three horses and a backpack for this beauty... in a small town at the tip of Ivory Coast. Lint. Don't know how I could have missed it. BARON: You must excuse me. Madame Dupree has arrived. I must see to her. Mr. Stetson, Amanda, my house is your house. [STAMMERING] Thank you very much, Mr. Baron. - What did you think of the baron? - A little compulsive. He notices even the tiniest piece of lint. Yeah. - Mm-hm. - Hold it, hold it, hold it. There he is. Matthew Hearns. Amanda, why don't you get rid of the woman? - Get rid of the woman? - Just get rid of the woman. - I'll get rid of the woman. - Yeah. Go on. [AMANDA CLEARS THROAT] [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] [AMANDA SPEAKS IN FRENCH] [AMANDA SPEAKS IN GERMAN] - Yes? AMANDA: Hello. - Hello. AMANDA: Oh, English. - Yes. - Uh... Uh... Well, there is a very handsome man in the hall and I think he's looking for you. - For me? - I think so. Oh, how wunderbar. AMANDA: In the hallway, there's a small group of people. WOMAN: Thank you. - Yes. You're welcome. Goodbye. Mr. Hearns? Please forgive me, I'm such a great admirer of yours. Amanda King. - It is my pleasure, I assure you, Amanda. - Oh, thank you very much. [LEE CLEARS THROAT] And, uh, this is a friend of mine, Lee Stetson. - How are you? Good to see you. - Mr. Hearns. It's nice to hear American voices. By the way, thanks for rescuing me from the countess. A pleasure to help a fellow American in trouble. - Well, I appreciate it. - Oh, uh... Well, you're the, um, goodwill ambassador to Europe now, aren't you, sir? - That's right. - Well, that must be wonderful. Well, as the song says, it's nice work if you can get it. But unfortunately, one of the drawbacks is there's so much to do, so little time to do it. As a matter of fact, I have to prepare a speech for tomorrow night. If you'll excuse me, I'll say good night to the baron. - Certainly. - If you don't mind my asking, uh... just how is your schedule for tomorrow? In the morning I'm making a speech at the Glockenspiel after the puppets' dance. Oh, my boys just love the puppets' dance. So do I. I guess I'm still a kid at heart. - Again, many thanks. Nice to see you. - Very nice to meet you, sir. - Mr. Stetson. LEE: Good luck. Thank you, sir. - He's a nice man, isn't he? - Yes, he is. Now, look, Amanda, I want you to stay here and mingle with the crowd. I'm gonna take a look around. - Mingle? - Yes, mingle. All right, I'll mingle. Hello. Lost your way? LEE: Uh, no, uh... No, I was looking for the little boys' room. It's down, uh, here. INGA: Ortiz, get the King woman. [FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING] Does your head still hurt? Hurt is not quite the word I'd use. - How about throb? - Yeah, good word. What am I gonna tell Mother? She must be worried sick. I didn't come home all last night. Yeah, I know that. I didn't even call. - Tell her you were tied up. - That's not funny. But it's true. Ortiz, silence the flute. I'm so sorry, my dear, for the inconvenient way you had to spend the night. Then maybe you'd consider letting us go. But I doubt it. INGA: We've located Haddy. He was seen in Bogenhausen. What about them? I don't know if we should leave them unguarded. Let me kill them. Inga, you're truly amazing. Did it ever occur to you that we might get some valuable information from them? I assure you, when the time has come to kill them, you may have the pleasure. Make sure their binds are tight, Ortiz, and lock the door from the outside. They won't be going anywhere in the short time we're gone. LEE: All right. [AMANDA SIGHS] - Lee, I'm scared. - I know, I know. LEE: We are gonna get out of here. See that vase? Ming dynasty, probably very expensive. Yeah, well, not anymore. You think you can wiggle over there with me? - Ready? - Yes. Okay. Go! Yeah. That's it. Come on. Keep going. Keep going. Closer. Jamie and I did the three-legged race in potato sack bags. Come on, closer. Almost like this. Come on, a little more. A little more. Closer, that's it. All right, now, look at me. Now press your head against the pedestal, come on. All right. Now squeeze hard. Squeeze against me. - All right. Now pull. Pull. Pull towards us. AMANDA: Unh! AMANDA: Ow! LEE: Pull it. All right, now brace yourself. We're gonna tip over. Soften the blow with your shoulder. AMANDA: Soften the blow with my shoulder? - Here we go. - Aah! [LEE GRUNTS] - Are you okay? - I think so. I heard something rip. Let's see if I can get a good, sharp piece here. AMANDA: I'm glad I wore the pants instead of the gown. Is this gonna take long? I'm trying as fast as I can. There, I think I can get it. There, it's going. There. - I suppose I'm next. - Yeah. [LEE SPEAKS IN GERMAN] - You too. - What? Wait here. I'm gonna go get Haddy. [POLKA MUSIC PLAYING] LEE: Haddy, come on. HADDY: Lee? They know you're in Bogenhausen, we've gotta move fast. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] No, please! LEE: Come on! Run! Whoa. Whoa! LEE: Haddy, hold it! BILLY: Halt! [SIREN WAILING] LEE: I'm an American agent. Hold him for me. I'll be back. - Everybody okay? - Yeah. Ortiz? - He's in good hands. - All right, listen up, everybody. Jason Styron left Munich last night. Now, Matthew Hearns leaves before nightfall. That means the assassination victim... has to be Randolph Benton, the aide to the president. That's what the baron wants you to think. It's the obvious choice, but it's not right. I'm convinced that Matthew Hearns is the target. The goodwill ambassador? His Royal Neatness is the backup assassin then? Sure. The baron, above all, has a sick sense of humor. Nothing would please him more than to kill a goodwill ambassador. Please, trust me on this. Matthew Hearns is at the Glockenspiel now. He's supposed to make a speech. - But then he leaves Munich. HADDY: I know the timing's not right. But I know that Matthew Hearns is the target. Can you tell us anything else before you get on the plane? I was forced to go underground. It's not the kind of night that falls when it gets dark. It's the kind of knight that wears armor. - The Glockenspiel. - Yes. That's it. The jousting knights. It'll happen when the Bavarian knight knocks over the red and white. Mother and the boys are there. The chimes are so loud you'd never hear a gunshot. - No, no, no. - Lee! Mother and the boys are there. Oh, all right, all right. Come on. [AMANDA YELLS] AMANDA: Gosh, put it down! LEE: Just hang on! [CHIMING] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Lee. Get out of the way! Nothing to worry about, old boy. Just a piece of lint. Take him. Did you spot your mother and the boys? They're right over there. Where? Hey, I'm supposed to do that. AMANDA: There really is a good reason why I didn't come home last night. DOTTY: Come here. I'm sure there is, dear. - Well, there really is. Yes, honey, you're a big girl, you don't owe me any explanation. Thank you, Mother. - You could have called. - I should have. - Yeah, but you didn't. - I was tied up. Amanda, look. If you don't have your memories, you don't have anything. Mother, it's not what you're thinking. You're too young to know what I'm thinking. Could I get, uh, something? Mother, I'm just gonna grab a couple of pictures of that statue over there. I'll be right back. Would you order some, uh, mineral water for me? I sure will. All right, what do you want, boys? I thought you'd like to know that Haddy got off all right. Oh, that's good. He's back in the States with his little boy. Great. Some of the information that he's giving us is turning out to be valuable. What about the baron? Ah, yes, the baron, our good friend and lint-picker. Turns out he was a major financier for terrorist activities all over the world. I hope he and his friend enjoy prison food. They're gonna be eating a lot of it. [AMANDA CHUCKLES] - Could I ask you one question? - Yeah. How did you rig it so that I would pick the right coffee can... off the right shelf at the right time? - Uh, you didn't. - I didn't? - No, we did. - How? Remember the box boy dropping the can and it rolled under the counter? Well, he switched it with the contest can. We know what brand of coffee you buy, so we had a substitute can ready. You mean the box boy is an agent? And the cashier. Gosh, used to be a simple neighborhood grocery store. [SIGHS] Well, look, would you do me a favor? Would you not put any more winning contest tickets in my coffee cans? - You got a deal. - Thanks very much. But I'd keep my eye open for the breakfast cereal boxes.
