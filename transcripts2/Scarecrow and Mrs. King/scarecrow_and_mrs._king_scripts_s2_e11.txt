 What do you think, Thomas? That's about it for tonight. We'll know more tomorrow when we put her back in the wind tunnel. Won't be long now, boys. We'll be going home soon. Take your time, sir. We're here for the night. Guard her plans well, gentlemen. She's the best, the best. Mach 6, radar-invisible... and she flies cold. No heat-seeker's gonna take her out.

 What in God's name...? Here, Garrison. Tell me again, how much? A hundred thousand a page, maybe. Just keep snapping. Hey, Mom, smile. - Was it a good one? - Yeah. Don't waste your film on me. Save it for the beach. - Okay. - You know what that means, don't you? Well, you won't believe it. - Cut it out. - Cut it out. - But this is it. Ha. I hope the Morrisons' car can hold it all. - Me too. Are you sure you don't wanna come with us and do the painting some other day? I've put it off long enough. I gotta get it over with. - Please? AMANDA: You boys be good...

 and do everything your grandmother tells you to do. - All right, we're ready. - And have fun. - Okay, bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye, sweetheart. Mwah. - Mwah. - I love you. - I love you too. - Okay. - Bye-bye. Jamie, fasten your seatbelt. Bye. - Ooh, burnt sand. LEE: Sounds like what I'm drinking. - What are you doing here? - Morning. Uh, you wouldn't have any half-and-half? I ran out this morning. What are you doing? Coffee break. I like my coffee black, just not this black. Uh, why don't you try the milk? It's better for you. - Milk? - Mm-hm. Okay. - Uh, you need anything else? - No. - Would you like some sugar? - I'm fine. - Uh, how about the morning paper? - No, no. How about telling me what you're doing? - I need you. - You need me? I need you. I came to ask you out. - You mean like on a...? - A date? Yeah, well, sort of. Oh, sort of. Oh, you mean it's business. It's not, uh... You know, it's not pleasure. No. No, no. That's where you're wrong. It is pleasure. For you, it'll be pleasure. Me, I may have to work just a little bit, but for you, it's just straight-out pleasure. - Oh. - Mm. Well, if it's gonna be such a lot of fun... why don't you just take the girl that you're seeing now? Um... Who is it, uh, Margo? She's the current... Margo and I aren't seeing each other anymore. Oh, well, you do go through them. Wait, now, look, she took off with an airline pilot, okay? I'm sorry. - Okay. - Yeah. There is a diplomatic reception tomorrow at the British ambassador's house. - It would be better if I had someone... - You need a person. - Yeah, just somebody to walk in with. - Uh... I understand. Good. Yeah. And, uh, look, I don't wanna spoil the surprise, but if you did come with me... you just might see an old friend of yours. An old friend? No, no. Murillo. Seventeenth-century. Spanish. They found it in a French château after World War Il. It's the pride and joy. Oh. Excuse me. And here comes your surprise. Where? EMILY: Amanda. Oh, Mrs. Farnsworth. It's you. It's so lovely to see you. Oh, it's so lovely to see you. Uh, that's Lady Farnsworth. Lady Farnsworth? Well, I'm afraid so, my dear. It happens in England when you marry Lord Farnsworth. OBE, MBE, BBC. Well, I wish I'd known... because I really should have been calling you Lady Farnsworth, not Mrs. Farnsworth. Oh, drop the lady and the missus. Call me Emily, please. Emily. - Uh, ladies, shall we? - Oh, yes. Oh, we're friends, aren't we? Good friends. And that's what he calls me. - Ha, ha! Uh, Amanda, I wonder if you might, uh, mingle alone for a little while. I wanna talk to Emily. Oh, that's what this is all about. You two are on a case together. What can I say, Emily? She just has this suspicious streak in her. I'll be all right. Just go ahead. - Okay. - Okay. Our boy just walked in. Look, while he's trying to put away half the champagne in the place... you might wanna make an exit for the powder room, hmm? - Yes, I don't want him to see my face. - Mm-mm. Thank you. Ahem. - Good evening. - Hello. Diana DeVore from the Society Page of the Dispatch. - Oh, well, hi. - I know you. You're with the French legation, in the chargé's office. - No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm... - Oh. You're American, of course. Ha, ha. I remember. State Department, the Mideast. No. Uh, actually, my name is Amanda King. I'm a housewife. I have two small boys from Arlington, Virginia. Arlington? Wonderful talking to you, Mrs. King. A housewife from Virginia. How much more exciting than being a stuffy old diplomat. Well, I... Sydney Whitsett, Mrs. King. - Is your husband about? - We're divorced. Oh, really? Mrs. King, tell me, is it me, or is it awfully warm in here? Stuffy. Yes, you know, I feel rather faint. - Oh, you do? - Perhaps some air. - Oh, yes, indeed. Here, let me help you. - Thank you so much. If you just give me your glass and I'll help you outside... and you can get a nice breath of fresh air and you'll feel much better. Excuse me. There's the signal. Yeah, and that's our lady. Come on. Thank you so much. It's been awfully nice to meet you tonight. Oh, I love it. Amanda has 200 people here to talk with and she chooses Whitsett. Lee, dear, you must learn to improvise. Amanda might just be very helpful. Say, aren't you Jack Whitsett? Oh, Sydney. That's right. Lee Stetson, IFF. Sir, my company is making a documentary on British manufacturing... and your firm would be perfect. Uh, I wonder if I might show you a couple of brochures on our work. - Perhaps some other time. - It will only take a minute. I have a brochure in my coat in the cloakroom. Oh, Sydney, that sounds very interesting. - I think I'd like to see the brochures. - Well... Why not? In the cloakroom? Yes. Yes, that's the spirit. Ha-ha-ha! I'll even buy you a drink. How about that? Hmm? Yeah. Waiter. Thank you. Wait up. You forgot this. Ha, ha. Uh, it's right this way, hmm? Ah. I really appreciate this. Ha, ha. Our work is very impressive, it'll knock you out. Oh! Oh, my gosh. He's fainted. He was sick before, he needed some air. Aah! EMILY: Shh! He'll be doing just fine. I drugged the champagne. Outside. Check the hall, Amanda. Yes, Emily. - It's clear. It's clear. EMILY: Down the walk. Car's waiting. Watch the door. Amanda, put your arm around our friend. Your arm, dear. Yes, that's it. Now, prop his head against your shoulder. Ah. Yes, that's lovely. Thank you. Babysitter One, this is Mobile Delivery. I have the package and I'm on my way. Mobile Delivery, this is Babysitter One. Abort. Do you read? Abort. Babysitter One, what do you mean, abort? A-B-O-R-T. Abort. This entire safe house quadrant is blacked out, we have no electricity. Do you read? Mobile Delivery, contact Mother Hen. You heard? Yeah. Now listen, nothing else is available tonight. I can get you men and equipment this evening, but we need a location. - Uh, Amanda? - Hmm? How long will your mother and the kids be gone? The neighborhood is gonna think I brought a drunk man home from the party. Just unlock the back door, hmm? - All right. - Good. - Good night. - Good night. Well, good night. I had a wonderful time. Good night. It was a lovely evening. Guy's something else. He's in there for the night. Any chance she's not the one? We'll worry about that on contact. Anything wrong with her, we kill her. Oh, no, Mr. Whitsett. I'm so sorry. Close the door all the way, please. He nearly fell off the couch. Yes, he's fine. - How long do you expect the drug to last? - Till morning. - Till morning? - Yeah. I figure he'll be out at least nine, 10 hours. - On my couch? - Mm-hm. Look, I better check on, uh, phase two, huh? Right. We'll hold the fort. Emily... what is phase two? Did I miss phase one? I realize all this must be terribly confusing to you. Well, it's just that, you know, I go to a lot... I go to a lovely party. It's a little confusing because I'm invited to this lovely party. I get a wonderful surprise. You're there. And then this man collapses and then I... Emily. Where is your accent? Oh. Ha, ha. Well, sometimes I drop it. You see, I'm an American. - You're an American? - Yes. From Santa Barbara. You're kidding. Emily... please tell me what's going on here. Amanda, sometimes in our business, it's best not to know too much. But I do want you to know that we're all grateful to you for letting us use your home. Ah. Well, you're welcome and you're right. I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't pry. Oh, no, no. Of course, dear. - Would you like a nice cup of tea? - Oh, yes. Or I could make you some hot chocolate. Or if you'd like, a little warm milk could be very relaxing. Oh, my gosh. All right, just set it up back there. - Uh... Uh, what are they doing? Phase two. - Who are they? - Uh, they're with us. Don't worry. Oh! My drapes. Do you think this is going to upset her terribly? Nothing to worry about. She'll go with the flow. Oh, my gosh! I'm afraid she's being swept away by the flow. - Amanda, let me explain about all of this. - No, all right, never mind. You don't have to explain. - What? - I understand. - This is phase two. - Good girl. I can have the false wall up in a couple of hours. - Yeah, good. - Where do you want this, Mr. Stetson? Uh, Emily? Well, I think behind wherever the desk goes. All right. Yeah, works for me. You, Amanda? What do you think? Oh, I don't know what to think. The point is, what will Mr. Whitsett think? So our messenger boy has awakened at last. - Where am I? - Ah. The plaintive cry of every man... that drinks to disgusting excess. Who are you? I am Tatiana Federovna Romarcheva. Romarcheva. I see someone in Moscow has mentioned my name to you. You're KGB, head of operations security. And discipline. Where am I? In the Soviet embassy. Which means... that even if you are in Washington D.C., you are on Soviet soil... and you are in a great deal of trouble. But why? Why? You ask me why? That is a question I should ask. Why, when you are finally given a task of tremendous importance... do you act so irresponsibly? Why, when you are not in this country even one full day... before you get drunk and pass out at a diplomatic reception? Last night? Yes, well, actually, I don't remember too much about that. Perhaps this will help refresh your memory. Yes, yes, that's Mrs. King. Good morning. - Good morning. - You're still here. Yeah. Actually, I went home, changed, came back. Oh, it's... - Emily? - Dining room. - Whitsett? - Dining room. Dining room. Gray walls, picture of Lenin? - Yeah. - Right. - It'd be okay if I make some tea? - Sure. Thank you. Excuse me. - Quietly. Yeah. - I will. I'm sorry. Sorry. Lee, what's Emily doing in the dining room with Mr. Whitsett? She's, uh, interviewing him. Why, who is he? Well, I mean, after all, he is in my house, I think I have a right to know. Yeah. All right. Sydney Whitsett is a small-time British businessman... who decided to earn some extra dough through treason and espionage. Now, under trade visits, heh... he's been a recent regular traveler to Moscow. What he's been doing is selling secrets. If you know all that... why haven't you stopped him? Well, the British... Actually, Emily. - -decided just to let him run. He's been small-time... but it's clear that Moscow is grooming him for something big. Like what? Ten days ago... two soldiers stole the plans to an Anglo-American super-fighter plane... called Falconwing. We clamped down on all the known Soviet courier routes... and bingo, Mr. Whitsett shows up in the U.S. of A. - Mr. Whitsett is the courier. - Yeah. You think Emily can make him talk? I know she can. What are you, Whitsett? A sloppy, greedy idiot or is it more? Hmm. Perhaps you work both sides of the street... No. And sell a little to the Americans too? - No, no. - Or worse. Maybe this bungling façade is a cover for a double agent. No. I have been faithful. I'm doing my job just as I've done all my previous jobs. Now, I'll take care of Falconwing. That is where you are wrong. I have been sent here to run Falconwing for you. But you can't. Do not presume to tell me what I can or cannot do. But I've set everything in motion. Let me do this job just like I've done all my other jobs, in Paris, Amsterdam. Go on. Tell me. You see, I'm gonna use an innocent as the intermediary, a woman. She's going to be the mule between me and the men who have the film. I see. Remain in your chair. Is that clear? - Emily? - Shh! Sorry. Yes, it's me. You're making tea? - Oh, yes, would you like a cup? - Oh, yes. - There you are. You can have mine. - Thank you. Well, I don't understand. I'm just doing a little playacting in there. If I can't act in the theater, I act in the dining room. Didn't I ever tell you I studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art? No. EMILY: Mm. My first role was at the Liverpool Repertory Theatre. Really? I'm impressed. Pardon, ladies, uh, for the intermission... but, uh, Billy wants to know if you've got anything. Yes, he just told me it's a mule job, so you better have Francine on standby. Done. Oh. Well... back to Russia. - She's an amazing woman. - That she is. Yeah. Well, I guess I should just go about my day then, huh? I was gonna paint Jamie's room. I guess painting the dining room is out but... Yeah, wait. The dining room is out, but Jamie's room, great. Good. Then I'll just run on to the paint store. It's over on 6th Street, Wilson's. They have the best color selection. Yeah. - I guess I should go now. - Ha, ha. Yeah. - All right, well, I'll see you later. - Ahem. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, Amanda. I have spoken to Moscow... and they have agreed that I will supervise your delivering of the plans for Falconwing. To that end, I, of course, will arrange for your innocent intermediary. But she's already been picked. The woman in the picture, Mrs. King. I signaled the soldiers last night that she was the go-between. Then we will contact this Mrs. King and use her accordingly. Well, do you think that's wise? I mean, without me, there could be mistakes. Hope for your own sake there are no mistakes. I heard. Amanda's the mule. - Where is she? - Paint store on 6th Street. Well, we've got to hurry, Lee. She doesn't know she's being targeted. Those soldiers are killers, if she doesn't... Emily. Shh. - We'll get her, okay? - Yes. I'll need my bag. - It's showtime again. - Come on. Hello. Anyone here? Oh! We're gonna try every paint store. We can try it. Oh, dear, I don't really think... I'm quite sure they don't have the proper colors. Uh, service, please. Service. - Where is the proprietor? MAN: Sorry. I didn't hear you come in. I was in back, mixing some special orders. Well, I think you might cease those petty chores and assist me. Now, I want to see all your red paint samples. Well, quickly, quickly, let's not keep madam waiting. I really don't think... - Oh, now, we'll find something. - Oh. Okay. Well, you see anything you like? My dear sir, I believe I said I wanted to see all your red samples. The entire spectrum. Everything red you can put your shopkeeper's hands on. Walter, you'd better check the wallpaper section. Something in red and gold. - Red and gold. - What about something like this? - Oh. No, that's rose. That's not red. I want red. Excuse me, I'm in the wrong department. Ahem. Lots of red. Yes, that's better. I'll stick by her. Get to the door and make sure she doesn't leave. Oh, sir. Excuse me. Uh, well, I need your opinion. Now, all the furniture in the room that's going to be painted... are authentic Louis XV reproductions. Those two men followed me from my house. - I want you to talk to them. - Talk to them? Yes. There shouldn't be any danger. Emily and I will be nearby. Uh, madam. Madam, this selection is atrocious... it's not even fit for the kennels. Ah. You're right, Walter, there's nothing here. Mm-hm. I mean, it's... Come along. We'll go to Rockford. There's a lovely store. - Oh! - Okay, lady. You come from Whitsett? Uh, yes, I come from Mr. Whitsett. Did he send you or what? Yes, he sent me. Well, you give our limey friend this. Five o'clock is the time. You got that? I give our limey friend this and 5:00 is the time. It's very easy. Let's hit it, man. Old Whitsett's got himself a cute little runner there. - Thank you so much. - All right. Uh... This is it. This is their negotiation demand. Not a bad price, $1,500,000. What is this long row of numbers and this weird word, "Stancrebs"? Well, those digits are an account number. And the word is a telex code. Standard Credit Bank, Zurich, Switzerland. Corner of E and 10th Street, that's a local address. That's their next meeting place. And we only have till 5:00. Not much time. LEE: Mm. This calls for something drastic. How dare you leave me here this long? You've been gone for hours. I see your time alone... has given you courage to be rude to your superiors. Now... the two American servicemen have made contact with your Mrs. King. They require a million and a half dollars. Then if your friends agree, tell them to deposit the money. - And then? - And then they get Falconwing. Don't be coy with me, Mr. Whitsett. How do they confirm the deposit? By prearranged code word. - Which is? - Which is my leverage. Only the soldiers and I know the deposit code. Either you let me run this operation as you promised or you don't get Falconwing. Those are my terms. I am to release you and you will go about your business on your own? Yes. Maybe I should show you what being on your own has already accomplished. Comrade, bring him in. I'm going, I'm going. You don't have to shove. You recognize him? Yes, vaguely. He was at the reception. Some sort of a filmmaker. Harmless. His name is Lee Stetson. He is an American agent. He has been trailing you ever since you arrived. We intercepted him. Have you been comfortable here, Mr. Stetson? Go to hell. You see? Like you, he defies me. Now, you will tell me the remaining details of your plan... including the code word. Ugh. The things you people do in your business. Ha, ha. I admit, it's not like other jobs. Oh, well, back in the bleach for this guy. Emily... there's something I've been meaning to ask you. - What? - Well... how did a sweet, nice woman like you who trained for the theater... get involved in the intelligence business? Very much like you. Accidentally. It was in 1952. James and I were living in Cairo. That's my late husband. - Hmm. - He was posted to the embassy there. I'd given up acting a long time ago. The foreign office needed someone above suspicion... to carry a message from Cairo to Gibraltar. And you got the job. Well, I got the message through and was hooked. I came back to Cairo and told poor James that I was going to London... for formal operative training. And here you are, still going strong. Amanda... I'm afraid I have to ask a great favor of you. Anything, Emily. It concerns Falconwing. I need you to meet with those two men from the paint store again. I'll do it. You're a very courageous young woman. You know it's for our two great countries. And for you. In a pool hall? It doesn't open for a couple of hours. Now, remember, give them the code word... they'll hand you a roll of film, then you get out of there. - Right. - Just stay alert. Lee and I are right here. Right. - And you'll be right here. - Yes. You startled me. This startle you too? Uh, the, uh, code word is "silver lining." Now, I gather you have something for me. Don't be in such a hurry, cutie. Now, have a seat. Now, I think we better have a little talk. I was told that when I gave you the code word... you would give me a little package and then I would leave. - Somebody say you could talk? - No. - Then zip it up then, all right? - Sykes. Sykes, why don't you go make the call, all right? I'll keep sweet cheeks here company. I bet you will. See, cutes, we got no real reason to trust your pal Whitsett. Maybe he just sends the codes... - then no money shows up in Switzerland. - Oh, no. Maybe he's just trying to take two bohunks for a ride. I really believe Mr. Whitsett will be true to his word. Yeah, he's a real prince, I'm sure. But just in case, we picked a bank with a 24-hour service desk. - So we're gonna find out in a minute. - Oh. Overseas operator? I'd like to make this a credit card call, please. Right. Hello. Is this the Standard Credit Bank in Zurich? Mais oui. This is the night service desk. May I assist you? Right. I'd like to check if there's been a recent deposit in my account. All I need to know is whether the balance is between $1 and $2 million. Ah, très bien, monsieur. You could give me the account number and the account code. 7-3-2-2-5-1. Account code: X7YF. If you will please wait one moment, I will check with our computer records. One moment, please. She's checking. - You're a fine-looking gal. - Oh, thank you so much. Hello, monsieur. Oui. Yes, the account shows the balance that you indicated as of this afternoon. Au revoir, monsieur. You yutz. Ha, ha. Hey, partner, it happened. The Russians ponied up, man. Give her the film, let's get on the plane. Wait a minute, Sykes. Think for a minute. - What we got here is gold. - What are you talking about? The Russians' money is already in place. They can't take it back. What would the Libyans pay for something like that? - You mean, sell it again? - Yeah, maybe two, three more times. We're talking big money here, Sykes. Big money. Excuse me, but that's dishonest and I don't think the Russians would like that. - I told you to shut up. - Oh, you did and I'm sorry. I should. But I should point out it might not be a good idea to double-cross the Russians. They're Russian. I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. She's been in there too long. Yeah, something's gone wrong. I'll need some props. Just give me five minutes. I'll call Billy. Right, you're right. They'll never find us. What about Whitsett? We cut our connection with him right here. You mean I kill her? - No. - Yes. Cleaning lady. Get rid of her. Excuse me, lady. We don't need any cleaning around here. I don't clean, I don't get paid. Amanda, get out of the way. Mama, I'm gonna take you out. Get the other one. Falconwing. Oh, I'll be so glad when this is all over. It's the worst-fitting wig I have ever worn. Ooh. That's all right. Amanda, you all set for the final step? Well, I understand what to do, but I don't understand why. - What's the problem? - Well... these are the pictures for the plans of Falconwing. - Right? - Right. And you captured the men who stole the pictures, right? - Yeah, right. - And we have Whitsett. Right. AMANDA: Right. - So it's over, right? - Wrong. Wrong? Bear with us, dear. - Yes, ma'am. We could wrap it all up now, but that would be too easy. All is going well. Mrs. King has the film and the two thieves are paid off. All that remains is for you to earn your money. Gladly. Where shall I inform Mrs. King to meet you? A liquor store on the corner of 10th and E Street. Bad neighborhood, few customers. I approve. I will see that she is there within the hour. After you meet her, you will proceed to Dulles Airport for your trip home. Then Moscow, where you may collect your retirement money. I knew my plan would work. I knew it. For that, you may count yourself a lucky man. Now, I must ask you to wear this. We are in the rear of the embassy. To take you out, we must pass through some very high-security areas. - I understand. - Come. I will escort you. Hey, mister. You make up your mind yet? - Mrs. King, good evening. - Hello. I gather some mutual friends have asked you to deliver something to me? - Yes. I have it. - Good. Okay, everybody freeze! Now, move. Move. You two. Move. Move. You two move. You, the money. Oh, man, this is the third time this month. Come on, hurry up. - Come on. - All right. I will have your wallet. And the lady's purse. Here's the wallet. But there's nothing in the purse but some film. It's of no value... Ow! GUNMAN: Now it is mine. Well, aren't you going after him? - I've got what I want. - Thank you. - Good job, Scarecrow. And you, ma'am. - Billy. - You both did a great job. - Ha, ha. Go on. Ew. - Oh! Oh! Oh, my gosh. - Ha-ha-ha! Well, partner, we pulled it off. - Right. It couldn't have worked without Amanda. Oh, well, there is just one little problem. He got the film. That man was Vasily Korovshin, a very good KGB agent. - KGB? - Yes. I asked for his presence myself. Made it look as though it came from Moscow. I told the Soviet embassy that Whitsett looked unstable... and suggested he should be watched on assignment. - Korovshin has been on him all along. - Oh. Amanda, this whole episode with the soldiers... wasn't the only time Falconwing has been in danger. See, we could have followed Whitsett... and when he drew out Garrison and Sykes, we'd have arrested them all. But the Russians wouldn't stop. They'd go after Falconwing time and again. And eventually, they might have succeeded. No, the only way to keep Falconwing away from them was to give them Falconwing. That's what we did. To be delivered by one of their own top people. - Now they have it. - That's right. Amanda, Lee switched the film. - Oh, wow. - Ha, ha. What they have is an incredibly clever set of plans... to an airplane that doesn't function. Even a computer analysis couldn't show the flaws. They take months and spend millions before they find out. By that time, our plane will be in the sky. Oh, I don't believe it. I mean, this is really brilliant. I mean, all the setting up and the planning. First taking Whitsett, then redoing my house and... My house. - We've got to undo that redo. - Oh, uh, God. I forgot to alert the crew. - My mother and my children... - Come on. - Come on. - Oh, no. Ooh, hurry now. And please don't break any of those dishes. Mrs. King? AMANDA: Yes? Uh, over against that wall. Thank you. Mrs. West, hello. Jamie. Hello, Philip. Anything on the back porch, get rid of it. I'll get it. Hi, sweetheart, hello. Hi, did you have a good time? It was great. Look like you got a little sun. Did you have a good time? - Yeah, Mom. I had fun, except one night, I ate clams, then threw up. Oh, sweetheart. Mom? AMANDA: Hmm? - The walls are... - Gray. Why on earth gray, Amanda? Well, uh, we thought it would be rather an interesting change. But I don't think it was such a good idea. I agree, Emily. I think I'll redo them. - They're not even dry. - Thank goodness. Well, come along, tell me. - Tell me about your trip. - Oh, yes, let's hear all about the trip. We'll go in the living room. - Yes. Good idea. It's me. Go, go. Get out of here. Get out of here. Go.
