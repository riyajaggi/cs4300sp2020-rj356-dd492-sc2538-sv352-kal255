 Oh, the South. Hi. Oh, I love it. Upstairs, right on the back patio. Careful, careful. Gail? Amanda, oh, I'm so glad you could make it. Hi. Hi. Oh, well, this is really something. Yeah, Mr. Sinclair has pulled some strings. - I wanna show you something. - Sure. What we'd like you to do is help with some of the practical demonstrations.

 All right. - And lookit here. - Oh, puppies! - Hi, come on, sweetie. - Hello, puppy. Hello, puppy. - Come here, puppy. - These rascals are our goal for this year. Last year, we raised enough money to train five guide dogs. - And this year, we hope to double that. - Oh, my gosh. - I had no idea they were that expensive. - Yes, they are. But maybe someday they'll help a little boy or a little girl to see through them. Oh, aren't they terrific? Oh, and over here is Mr. Sinclair. He's the organizer and the sponsor for our group. He's been blind since he was a boy. But he's wonderful with the children. That's why we're here. - Yeah. - Come on over. I'll let you meet him.

 Oh! Ha, ha, one of them got out. Kathy, could you get him? Mr. Sinclair, this is Mrs. King. She's one of our new volunteers. How do you do? You're doing wonderful work here. Oh, thank you. We're here for the children, Mrs. King. Yes. Well, I'm so glad that I can help out. Well, their smiles will thank you. Might as well take them both. - I get the brunette, you get the blond. - Hey, no problem. - I've got something to show you. - Sure. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Sinclair. - Nice to meet you. Amanda, I really appreciate your helping out. - I know how busy you are. - Oh, I'm happy to help. - Then I guess I'll see you Wednesday. - Right. - Say hi to your mother and kids. - I will. - Okay. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. We're gonna lose her. Get the blond. I'm not facing Pierce empty-handed. Well, her car's not going anywhere. Piece of cake. Sounds like you could use a hand. I'm good around cars. Oh, thank you. It won't start. I don't know what's wrong. Let's take a look. Oh, you know, I don't know anything about cars. Well, it might be something real simple. Oh, well, I just got it tuned. I don't understand this. Isn't that like every car? - So... - Ooh. I've got a tool chest in the side door of my van. - Could you get it for me? - Sure. Thank you. - You know, this is very nice of you. - No problem. Oh. I hate cars. - Got good spirit. - They like them that way. Button it up, baby. Okay. Fifteen seconds, man. Hey, we're getting better. Okay, come on, fellas. What's going on? What are you doing with our laundry? - Taking it to work. - Our dirty laundry? Yes, Mother. Did you get everything? - Including Jamie's stinko shirt. - Oh, come on. - Cut it out. - Go check your lunches, huh? Go on, run. - I'm waiting. - For what? For you to tell me why you're taking laundry to work. I don't know. Amanda, this film company you work for is very strange. I'm sorry. All I know is they told me to bring my laundry to work. Our machines work just fine. - All you have to... - I know. - You're gonna do a commercial. - What? With secret cameras. That's why they won't tell you. To catch you in the act with your detergent. No, no, no. You'll be on TV? - I'm not. - Just don't say you like the product... if you really don't. They try to trick you. If we're rich, can I have a bike? - I don't think we'll be rich. - Jungle gym! - Please! AMANDA: See what you started? - Got everything? Lunch, books? - Yeah! - Yeah. - All right. Be very careful. Don't walk through vacant lots. Stay on the sidewalks. - Bye-bye. Study hard. - Bye-bye. Be good boys. PHILIP: Okay. It's just a simple courier assignment. A simple mid-level courier assignment. Amanda is not ready for that. All she has to do is exactly what she's told. She never does exactly what she's told. She has good common sense. Billy, she will be out there without any backup. She'll be totally alone. And safe within her own element. This courier must simply act like a housewife. - Just act like housewife? - That's right. I can do that. I do that every day. Just a simple, average, ordinary housewife. But, Amanda, this is not what you're used to. You'll be alone. See, we can't afford to arouse suspicions by having our backup agents spotted. Is this dangerous? It's just a simple drop. - Yes, sir. Sir, just exactly what is it that you want me to do? Go to a Laundromat, wash your clothes. At some point, a man will give you a sock. - One sock? - One sock. Dirty or clean? - It doesn't matter. - It does. If it's clean, it'll look suspicious if I wash it. Now, don't wash the sock. - It has a microdot in it. - Oh. Just put it with your laundry, then bring it back here. Right. Just go the Laundromat, wash my clothes, get the sock. Another day on the job. Heh. Who is this other woman? This brunette? Her name is Amanda King and we know where she works. A documentary film company. IFF. Then why are you here? Follow her. Bring her into the family. - Kurtz is already on it. - Good. Amanda. - Oh, hi, Sarah. - What are you doing here? - Your machines are on the blink, too, huh? - Yeah, well, I guess they are. - You expecting someone? - No, I was just hoping... - the parking meter hadn't run out. - The parking meter. Uh-huh. Yeah. - Any problems? - Just wait. Billy, we got a problem here. Our drop man just activated a backup plan. What's going down? He's in a jam. He had to switch the contents of the drop Amanda will be receiving. - A different microdot? - That's right. Tripod has been blown. Tripod. That's our three agents in Leningrad, right? Yes. The new microdot contains the plans to get our guys out of Russia. The KGB must be after them. We only have 48 hours to get our guys out of there or they'll be killed. And that means they could be on to our drop man. And Amanda's "simple little assignment" could now get her killed. - Your boys are growing so fast. - Yes. I guess Freddie is gonna be puny like his father. Oh, gee, I sure hope not. Oh, my gosh. Gosh, how clumsy of me. Thank you so much. It's not safe. - Then I should fold my laundry at home. - Good idea. Well. Aren't you gonna fold those? No, I think I'll just fold my laundry at home. It's not safe here. - Hey! Hey, you! - No! No! No! No! No! - Get out of...! - Hey, forget it, buddy. He's gone. Just trying to help. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Thank you very much. - All right. - No problem. I'll take it from here, thank you. Thank you very much. Ow! - You're all right? - Yes. - What happened? - I don't know. He was outside waiting. At least he didn't get the laundry. Oh, my gosh, he got the sock. - What? - In my purse. - My God. Why? - Your man inside said it wasn't safe. I thought they would search the laundry for the sock, but they'd never search my purse. Lee, who would put a sock in a purse? Well, that sock happens to represent the lives of three people. That's a vital code that we have to have. In 48 hours, three undercover agents will be caught and killed. - I'm sorry. - Sorry? I'm the one who is sorry. - God. - Here. - Now, come on. - I got my own car. What? He got my keys. This is it? A purse? We sell women... not luggage. Yes, sir, Mr. Pierce. There were a lot of people around at the time. If Kurtz and Dagget hadn't showed up when they did... some good Samaritan would've pounced on me. Now it just seems like a purse snatching. You don't understand. I need... this woman. The buyer has seen her picture. What about her? This luscious creature... is only a blonde. She will draw a decent dollar. But Mrs. King is a brunette. And brunettes are in. Our client is looking for a cultured woman to add to his collection. Someone who can train the others. Now, I am not a flesh peddler. I deal in class. What's the big deal about this Mrs. King? There's plenty of brunettes. Suburban housewives appeal to the buyer's sense of humor. Mrs. King is worth more than five blonds. He wants her. Not just her purse. All of her. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. Yes, well, thank you very much for telling me. All right, thank you. Goodbye. I have the numbers. Gonna cancel all your credit cards. I can't believe this happened in broad daylight. We're just lucky you're all right. What's the matter? Mother, that was the charity committee. Gail didn't get home, night before last. - What happened? - They don't know. - Her car is still parked on the street. - Amanda, that's awful. Oh, it makes you so mad when things like that happen in your own neighborhood. Now, we're not gonna just stand here and allow it to happen. I'm gonna call our councilman. - What's his name? - Councilman Hogan. - I've got his number. - Hi. Hi, fellas. JAMIE: Mom? Think you're gonna do that commercial? I don't think so, sweetheart. It didn't work out so well. - I wanted to see you on TV. - Yeah, well. - Can we go in the backyard, play football? - Sure you can. - Just don't talk to strangers. - In the backyard? There shouldn't be strangers in the backyard. - If there are, tell me. - You won't believe this. - What? - I got a recording. - I believe it. DOTTY: Makes me mad. - Mom, is Billy Bartlett okay? - Yeah, Billy's okay. - Jamie, Billy can't catch. - At least he's not a stranger. That's right. Go on. - You're leaving? - I'm gonna go to the charity... fill in for Gail and try to find what happened. - All right, but be careful. - I will. - You watch out for the little boys. - I will. Ugh. That lovely perfume must be Mrs. King. Hello, Mr. Sinclair. Is there any word on Gail? No. The police are doing all they can. Try not to worry. Well, I just thought I'd come by and see if I could help out. Well, I'm sure Mrs. Taylor would really appreciate that. If there's anything you need, you just look for me. - Or any of these people can help you. - I will. And Mrs. King, the children thank you. Forward. Come on. - Where would you like me to put these? - What are you doing here? Amanda, I need you. We may have gotten a break on this case. One of our sources seems to think... the guy who attacked you the other day was a purse snatcher, not an agent. I didn't get a good look at him. You did. I really need you to come down and look at some pictures. Well, all right. Good. Come on. Mm-mm. - How about this one? - Mm-mm. I think this is him. You're absolutely sure? I'm not absolutely sure, but I'm pretty sure. Okay. Let's run a computer ID on him. Oh, he's using a new name. Rollo. What else? Petty criminal. Likes money, doesn't care much how he gets it. Yeah, into a little bit of everything, huh? Looks that way. If the money is right, he'll do just about anything. Excuse me. Don't suppose there's an address on that. - Is there? - No. Get an APB out on the description, try to track him down. - Okay. - How much time left on Tripod? Thirty-four hours. - Get a move on it. - All right. Lee, what if the microdot fell out of the sock? That'd be great. Would be in the street somewhere. Or it could be in my laundry. I haven't put it away yet. - Your mother and kids? - At the movies. Let's go. Thank you. LEE: Mm-hm. What? - This is dumb. - What? The microdot isn't in your laundry. Oh, we don't know that until we look. Gut instinct. You do what I do, after a number of years, you develop this intuition. Yes, like mothers' intuition or women's intuition. Maybe intuition isn't quite the right word. Oh, yes. That's a good word. What I'm trying to say is, Amanda, I have more experience than you, right? Well, you have more experience in certain areas. - I have more in other areas. - I'm talking about being an agent. - Oh. - Yeah. I'm talking about years of training, honing my instincts. Oh. You're not picking up on what I'm saying to you. What are you saying to me? You should have never taken that assignment. Mr. Melrose asked me to do it. Yes, but if you were listening closely to me, I was asking you not to. - You were? - Yes. And that is the difference between a pro and non-pro. Being able to pick up on the subtle nuances. In my estimation, that courier assignment should've been taken... by somebody with a mid-level clearance. God. All right, let's... What is...? You don't really actually wear this, do you? Yes, Philip and Jamie gave it to me. Oh, Philip and Jamie gave it to you, did they? Ha. Well. Well, hot mama. It seems that three of our best agents are in a great deal of trouble right now... because we lost a vital microdot. And the only lead that we have to this vital microdot... is with some damn purse snatcher named Rollo. And here I am, sitting in your den, going through your laundry... and feeling very much like an idiot right now. So... So... So I'm very... I'm very sorry, Amanda. I lost my temper again. I seem to be always saying things that... Well, sometimes that's when people are most honest. Yeah, and the dumbest, so... Lee, I think we should stop. - There's no microdot in this laundry. - I don't mean that. We should stop working together. I don't think we should be partners anymore. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We have never been partners. - We have been partners. - I don't work with partners. You know it. - You're losing your temper again. - I am not. I know you think I really messed up this time. - You make me crazy. - You think I'm right for the agency. - Why are we having this discussion? - Just remember... I didn't ask to join the agency. You got me into it in the first place. I'm not holding you there, am I? No. Why are we talking? - What are we talking about here? - My resignation. I think I should probably give it to Mr. Melrose. Do what you think is best for you, that's all. Well... I will, then, I guess. I'll turn in my resignation. - Well, fine. - Yeah. I don't believe this. Come on. Move it. Get in. Come on. - All right, hold it! - Hey, get out of there. You guys take care of the merchandise. I got him. No, Amanda! It's over. It's over. It's over. Everything's fine. They're gone. - I've never been so scared in my life. - I know. I'm glad Mother and the boys weren't here. Why did they come? I don't know, but I'll find out. Believe me. Who are they? I don't know. Why did you come back? I didn't like the way our little disagreement ended. I drove by, saw the van in the driveway, your front door was open... It wasn't a little disagreement. You said that I should resign. - No. You said that you were gonna resign. - You agreed with me. - Here we go again. - Then you mean it, don't you? - No... No, I didn't totally mean it. - But you mean it a little. - Maybe a little. - See, you said it again. Said what? I don't even know what I said anymore. Hurry up, boys. Amanda? You gotta get him out of here. - Yeah. It's dark out here. - Come on, friend. - Amanda! You arrest him, huh? - You bet. Amanda? Hi. Well, we have a windstorm, I guess. You gotta watch the front door. - Can be very dangerous. - I know. - The lights are out. - I know it. How was the movie? - It was very gory. - Talk about great. It was excellent. - Can I have a bullwhip? - Not in this life, dear. Grab your flashlights, go upstairs, get ready for bed. I'll be up in a minute. - Okay. Bye, Mom. - There you go. Go on now. Be careful. - That is really something out there. - Oh, I know. It's quite a lightning storm, isn't it? My gosh. - Yes. - What happened? Well, you could say that the wind blew in the front door... and blew out the back door and blew the room out. - Oh, Amanda, sweetheart. - Oh. - You could've been hurt. - Well, it was... Let me fix you a cup of tea and you can me all about it. I don't believe it. Yeah, I know. Gentlemen. So good of you to meet me. Let's talk. Rollo's getting caught has put a crimp in things. He won't say anything. You'd better be right, Dagget. For all your sakes. The price on the King woman has gone up even higher than before. I talked to the buyer this morning... told him all about your little escapade last night. Mrs. King's spirited performance appeals to him. He feels that will make her an even better leader for his collection. What do we do about this guy who keeps showing up? Get rid of any inconveniences. No need to be polite. I want Amanda King. Now. Well, I find that pretty hard to believe. I think you're just covering for her. - What, Amanda? - Mm-hm. I'm telling you, she fought back. - What do you think she'd do? - Faint, sort of a suburban swoon. Hardly. She was great. - Even took one out with a lamp. - A lamp? I would never use a lamp. Oh, I know. We've gotta watch our nails. I've decked guys with a lot less. - First dates are rough. - They always come back for more. Is this a great town or what? I will bet that Rollo will be out by Saturday night. You know, I am gonna really enjoy doing a number on him. Yeah? You're gonna have to wait in line. You've already had run-ins with him. I never have. It should be me. That way, he won't what's coming. - Oh, Francine... - Hey, look. We don't have much time here. We need results. I'm a woman, Rollo is a man. Therefore, I can... You can back me up quite nicely. If you will remember Singapore in '81. Oh, I do remember Singapore. You walked in right in the middle of my interrogation and broke the mood. It took another 24 hours to break the subject. He was not going to crack the way you were doing it. We'll never know, will we? - I'm not the one who's keeping track. - You're not. But somebody better be keeping track, because you remember Panama in '82. - I cracked that sucker in no time. - You did. You were great. But that was a diplomatic courier. Whole different ball game. Rollo is a scuzzball. He wouldn't understand a subtle threat or a delicate approach. You have no idea what kind of approach I am going to use. Just because I'm a woman does not mean I will always be subtle and delicate. Okay, you are right. You are absolutely right. - Oh. - Tell you what. We'll flip for it. What we need here is an executive decision. I wanna know who you guys are and where the hell I am. Shut your face, bozo. You better tell her what she wants to know, Rollo. I am telling you, I do not know anything. All right, scuzzball. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Why were you after Amanda King? This is your second attack. Okay. Okay, I'll tell you. I wanted to rob her. That's it. I just wanted to rob her. All right. Where did you put her purse? How would I know? I deal with a lot of purses. I'm not buying it, Rollo. She's not buying it, Rollo. - Look... just give me five minutes alone with him. All I need is five minutes. See, I don't know. I... I covered you last time. I don't think I can go to bat for you again. Who the hell are you guys any...? - Three minutes. All I need is three minutes, Lee, please. All right, maybe. Maybe. Only this time, I don't wanna have to watch. I mean, it was brutal. Hey, I got my rights. I want a lawyer. Yeah. And I wanna be 6'8" with a jump shot. Now, you just sit right where you are, okay? Don't you go anywhere. Could be possible. Snatch her purse, get the address. Come back later, rip the house off. - It's possible. - Do you buy it? No. Well, children, we only have 12 hours to get that microdot. Any suggestions? I think we let him go. Take him down the back way. I have $50 and that's it. Ooh. You don't gotta kill me, man. - What? I'm not the one who's shooting at you, you jerk. Who is, then, if not you? Take a guess. What did you think your buddies would do when they found you snitching? Yeah, yeah, you could be right on that one. All right, listen. You protect me, I'll tell you what you want. Just promise me protection right now. Yeah. All right, we'll protect you. Why were you after Amanda King? We weren't gonna hurt her or anything. We don't ever damage the merchandise. Merchandise? That's the same thing you said in the house. Nothing personal. It's just business, man. You were never after Amanda's purse. You weren't gonna rob her. She's nothing but merchandise to you? What were you going to use her for, huh? What? - We... We were gonna sell her. - You what? You were gonna sell Amanda? - Down. - Yeah, get down. Now, where are these women you were gonna sell? Okay, okay, okay. They're on a yacht. Don't ask me where, because I don't know. Every night, they change the dock and change the name. Don't ask me. I don't know. All right, come on. - No... Oh, down. - Come on. Francine! Looks like we have a little change in plans. What the hell...? You guys cheated. That's right, Sherlock. They weren't after the microdot. They were after Amanda. There's this yacht. Wherever this yacht is, that's where the purse is and the microdot. You take scuzzball here and put him on ice. Find that yacht. I'm going after Amanda. Got it. Come on. Come on. All right, now, we'll move relatively slowly. There's not a lot of furniture in the room. I suggest you put your hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you. You see, without a cane or a guide dog... even walking through a room can be difficult for someone who's blind. Ah... there is a piano right next to you, Ellen. All right now, we'll stop here just for moment. And please... There you are. Just stop for a moment. Stand still. The money raised by this charity will provide services... which help ease many of these very same problems. The use of a guide dog would have made this demonstration much easier for you all... but their training is quite extensive and expensive. But your money will be providing someone... not only with a way of seeing, but with a friend. These dogs aren't just a guide. They become family. Now, we're almost finished. Just remember that the blind do face these problems every moment of every day. Now, I'll just check the hallway and be sure it's not too difficult for you to navigate. Just a moment. Mr. Sinclair, you can see. Oh, Mrs. King, it's a miracle. What the hell is that? All right, let's get him in the van. - Get any more information from Rollo? - Not much. Losing your touch? - Can't get blood from a stone, Billy. - Depends on how hard you squeeze. What did you get from him? Well, it's definitely some sort of a boat. That had already been established. He called it a yacht. The more I kept questioning, the more he kept calling it a ship. - The name of the ship? - It still might be a yacht. Yacht, ship. What's its name? The last time Rollo saw it, it was called the Moonbeam. - But the name changes all the time. - Where was it last docked? At the 89th Street pier. But it's not there anymore. - I already checked. - Damn. - Scarecrow or Amanda called in yet? - No. - Scarecrow still won't answer his remote. - Terrific. Any suggestions? Chasing a boat that changes its location and name as often as I change my socks. We've got something. How often is that? - Not funny. - A little levity... We've got three lives at stake here and the clock is ticking. I'm sorry. Accepted. Listen, try to get something more from Rollo. A lot of lives depend on it. Including Lee and Amanda's. Okay? Okay. You're a fool, Sinclair. The King woman is worth much too much to the buyer... for you to risk the deal by having her for yourself. I don't plan on keeping her long. Besides, you seem to be forgetting something, Pierce. Your only job is to broker the deal with prospective buyers. But it is I who run this little enterprise. And the last person who called me a fool... died. Just like you're about to. Oh, don't worry, old friend. It's a fast-acting poison. And I'm told the pain is minimal. Dispose of Pierce. And show Amanda in. He said you were gonna sell me, but that isn't true, is it? Oh, it's quite true. I prefer to look at myself as someone who provides a delicate service... for certain lonely, but very wealthy men. Oh, well, I... You have very delicate skin, Amanda. I won't be selling you right away. First, you and I will be together. Yes. Take her to her friend, but blindfold her first. I don't want her knowing her way around the ship. Just in case. Come on. You gonna tell me what you're gonna do with me? Look, you got it all wrong, Rollo. It's what you wanna do with me. Do you dream, Rollo? Doesn't everybody? What the hell has that gotta do with anything? Whew, is it hot in here? No. Oh. Must be me, I guess. I'm just really hot. Or could it be you? - Me? - Mm-hm. I'm just sitting here. You know what? I like short men. - I don't know what you have in mind... - You don't shave every day, do you? I got a lot of things going on in my life lately. That's rough. That is really good. You know, that gives you that kind of an animal look. That's good. I could get really used to that. Lady, I don't know... I don't know where you're coming from. I still don't know who you are. All I know is you just wanted to chew my nose off and then you try to trick me... and now you're coming on... I don't know. I ain't coming on to you. I'm talking about the way you look. I do look pretty rugged, huh? Oh, it's not that. It's our bodies. - Our bodies? - Mm-hm. The contours. - Contours? - Hm. We mesh perfectly well. Um, yeah. Absolu... Too bad we don't have a cot or something, huh? I like it rough. Now, we got a lot of things to talk about. - And then we've got a lot of things to do. - Yeah. All right, step up. All right, step down. - Lee. Oh! - Amanda. It's no use. Oh, Lee. Are you all right? All right? I'm chained to a pipe. Do I look all right? - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay, it's okay. - Gail? - Yeah. Gail? Amanda, she's drugged. If we don't get a move on it, you're gonna be next. Lee, they were after me all the time. They were never after the microdot. My purse is upstairs on the desk. You saw it? It's on the desk. I bet the sock is still in it. Come on, gotta move. - I'm gonna get you out of here. - Now, wait. - Yes? Yes? - Amanda. - Amanda, I have got a plan. - What is it? Look, I've worked this pipe loose from the joint. Just a little bit with some more weight, I think we can disconnect it. Grab that towel, wrap it around the pipe. Go on. - Yes. - All right. Now let's pull down. - Drop our weight? - Yes. All right? Now. It's going. It's going. - Look, Amanda. - Yes? - What we were talking about before? - Yeah. It's a good idea that you leave the agency. Oh, no, I don't think so. Look, if you weren't working for the agency, you wouldn't be in a mess like this. Yeah. But I wouldn't have you to save me either, then, would I? One more pull. What's going on in there? Now! I was unconscious when they brought me down here. Show me the way. I know the way. A step up, a step down, a few steps forward. Follow me. - All right. - There's a step up. Don't miss it. - You found it. - Yeah. There's a step down. Be very careful. Follow me, now. We're gonna go up soon. Okay. There's the sock. Let's see. There, here it is. Now, you put that someplace where it'll be safe. Right. Yeah. Good. - Close to my heart. - Yeah. Nice touch. Now, let's see if I can find some keys and get these things off. Aha. Oh, that's a lot of keys. Forget it. - Come on. Let's find a radio. - Right. I wonder where Sinclair is. Go on, get! Call Billy, frequency 01. Use code 1XY2. Ooh. Okay. Hello? This is 1XY2. Come in, please. Hey! This is 1XY2. Please, come in. BILLY: Melrose here. Sir, it's Amanda. I have the microdot, sir. - Amanda, where are you? - On a boat. What's the name of the boat? - Nightwing. But I don't know where we're docked. Okay, that's enough information. We're on our way. Yes, sir. Francine, the name of the boat is Nightwing. Track it through the harbor masters. Get Kaylin and Mellor to help you. Okay, right on it. - Did you get ahold of Billy? - He's on the way. Too bad you'll both be dead and I'll be long gone. Kind of came in handy. Yeah. Sorry.
