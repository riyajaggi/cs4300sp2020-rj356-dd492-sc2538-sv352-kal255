 Oh, hello. What did you say? - Hello. Hello. Did you have a nice trip? Did I have a nice trip? It all started with me being rousted out of bed... - in the middle of the night by Billy. - Sorry. - Did I mention I'd taken a long weekend? - You didn't. I'd taken a long weekend, which had just started. Gillian's got a terrific lodge up in the Poconos. Gillian has a lodge in the Poconos.

 Yeah, so I was rousted out of bed. There were all those questions down in the office... which I had no answers to. It must have been just awful. The flight over the Atlantic was very nice. Nine hours and 45 minutes, but very nice. You're angry with me. Now, why should I be angry? Hmm? Why should I even be surprised? You were sent here to do agency business. All you had to do is deliver an envelope. That's all. And you get yourself arrested for passing counterfeit money? I didn't know it was counterfeit. You know I would never do a thing like that. The German government is very, very unhappy.

 - The American government is very unhappy. - I am very unhappy. Counterfeiting louses up everybody's economy. - I know you're disappointed. - Oh. - I'm a little disappointed myself. - Mm-hm. Doris Semple was supposed to pick me up at Dulles International Airport. My mother and Philip and Jamie are probably worried sick about me. I'm in jail in Germany. I've never been in jail before. And I don't even speak German. The only word I know is edelweiss. Okay, okay. I learned that from The Sound of Music. I saw it seven times. Yeah, take it easy, huh? Just take it easy. What's gonna happen to me? Well, for the moment, you are to be released in my custody. - I am? - But you can't leave Germany. I can't leave Germany? It's good to be out. I spent the night in jail. I can't believe it. - They even took my fingerprints. - Ah. I really should call my mother. She'll be worried. Now, how long should I tell her that I'll be here? They really can't keep me indefinitely, can they? Amanda, this thing goes way beyond that 20 you slipped the shopkeeper. I did not slip the shopkeeper a 20. I tried to buy a present. Frau King? Oh, no. Frau King, my apologies. Lieutenant Dieter Volkenauer. Uh, Lee Stetson. A friend of Frau King. Yes, I was told. Uh, my apologies, but a question arises on which there's a slight confusion. - Yes? - Who is Hymie? Hymie? Well, I'm sorry, I don't think I know a Hymie. Forgive me, but in your formal statement, the name was mentioned. You said quite clearly, uh... "the miniature train was purchased for a Phillip and a Hymie." No, no, no, that's Jamie. Not Hymie, Jamie. They're my two boys. Your sons, of course. I shall make a note of that. You see, a simple clarification was all that was required. Now, should any other questions arise, you will be available? Since you have her passport, that's a rather academic question, don't you think? Of course I'll be available. Thank you, Frau King. I hope you enjoy your stay in München. - Thank you. - How can she miss? It's ringing. - Oh, no. - Ahem. I hope she hasn't been too worried. Hope she didn't call the police. Hello, Mother! Mother, is that you? Yes, it's Amanda. Amanda! Yes, Mother. I'm sorry I haven't called before. This is the first chance I've had and I know you must be worried sick... No, I hadn't really thought about the time difference. I just knew that you and the boys must be worried and so I... Uh... Uh, well, no, Mother, I'm not enjoying myself. They won't let me leave Germany. Well, no, Mother. Actually, it's just... It's the silliest, most ridiculous... It's such a funny thing. Um... I've been arrested. I said, I've been arrested. Arrested! Will you call her back later? Mother, maybe I better call you back later. I know that's what it sounded like I said. Uh, I'll call you later, Mother. Give my love to the boys. Yes. Yes, Mother. Goodbye. I guess maybe I should've called from the hotel room. Yeah. - Well, she wasn't worried. - Good. Good. I would have been, wouldn't you? Amanda, do you want her to worry or not? You can't have it both ways. No, no. Of course I don't want her to worry. It's just... You know, it's awful. I can't even tell her what's the matter, why I can't come home and... That is going to be a bit of a problem. It seems that there's been a lot of counterfeit American 20s... showing up all over Munich. Well, they can't think that I am some part of some kind of a ring. - Uh... - I mean, Lee, come on now, I told them exactly what happened. I was on my way to the airport... and I decided to do a little last-minute shopping. So I stopped into a little antique store... and bought a tiny little bisque figurine for Mother. Now, that was before I went to the train shop. And that was where the man changed my marks for dollars. I don't know why he won't admit it. Come on, you can't expect a man to admit... - he's been passing counterfeit money. - Oh, gosh. He doesn't wanna get stuck with the bills or the rap. Gosh, I... You know, I was so excited about coming to Europe as a courier. All I had to do was just deliver an envelope for Mr. Melrose... and I get this nice, free trip and... - Well, I did that and that was no problem. - Yeah. The problem came afterwards. Well, I guess there are a lot of couriers. Yeah. - So this probably happens a lot. - Never in recorded history. - Never? - Never. I gotta figure this thing out, otherwise you will not get out of Germany. Which means I will not get out of Germany. You are my responsibility. I'm sorry. I hate to be anyone's responsibility. You know, I remember what they said back at the station. If there's a lot of counterfeit floating around Munich... and an ongoing investigation... I'll bet Harry knows something about it. He doesn't miss a hell of a lot. - Who's Harry? - Harry Hollinger. Our man in Tegernsee. It's a resort area about 45 minutes outside of town. You think he might know something? If anybody does, he will. Ha. He's one of our top operatives. He's quick, sure, thorough, a real pro. I've spent a couple of years with him. Amanda, I think I'm seeing a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. We'll spend the night in Tegernsee with Harry. We'll get a few answers. Hmm? Would you care for another drink, Mr. Hollinger? Now, that takes some careful thought. Yes. - Lee? - Harry. - No, it can't be. - Yes, it is. Hey, hey. LEE: Ha, ha! - Oh, it is good to see you. Ha, ha. - Good? It's incredible. But what are you doing in Tegernsee? Aren't you still stationed out of D.C.? Got it. You're the bearer of glad tidings. I'm being recalled. No, no, it's just a visit. - You visiting too? - Oh, sort of. Oh, this is Amanda King. Uh, an associate. Hello, Mr. Hollinger. Oh, Harry, Amanda. Even to non-associates. I see old Billy's taste has taken a decided turn for the better. How long you two staying? The longer the better. My schloss is your schloss. - Uh... - Oh, well, that's very nice of you. Nice? I'd kill for company. The right company. Do you know how long it's been since I've seen this joker? - Port Said. - Hey, this definitely calls for a drink. No, no, it's a bit early, huh? Hey, would you lose all respect for me if I said it's 5:00 somewhere? What are you talking about, man? I never had any respect for you anyway. Pear schnapps, it settles everything. Uh, not the problem I brought with me. Um, we need help. Is there somewhere we can talk? - Sure, gotcha. Right out front. - Okay. I'll settle up here and I'll be right with you. He's really a relaxed kind of guy. Yes, well, he seems very nice. Yeah, he's the best. I mean, he's obviously not working on a case. I mean, Harry... Harry can party with the best of them, but not when he's working on a case. Sure. Well, the mountains are really beautiful, aren't they? - Peaceful. - Yeah. - Yeah, they're called Alps. - Oh, I know. Alps. - The Bavarian Alps. - Bavarian Alps. Help is on the way. Uh... Harry... uh, we've run into a little trouble in Munich. That is, Amanda ran into some trouble. - Yes, you see, I... - Early or not, you gotta try this stuff. Farmer I know makes it just outside of town. Um, Mr. Hollinger, I don't think you understand. You see, I've been arrested for passing counterfeit American money. Federal rap. Yes. Now, this is 100 percent pure. - No added coloring. No preservatives. - Harry. I told Amanda you're the best man in Germany to help her. It took us at least 45 minutes to drive out here and a half an hour to find you... and, uh, you're drunk. Now, that is not only judgmental, it's premature. I am not drunk. I am drinking. Man, what happened to you? Nothing. Nothing has happened. Nothing will happen. This is Tegernsee. Nothing ever happens in Tegernsee. You fool. Months of planning and you jeopardize it for what? - For what? - Herr Portillo... For nothing. For your own personal, infantile amusement. To impress some beer garden waitress with your pockets full of American money, huh? Your father was a good Nazi. He believed in the movement. He worked for it. He followed orders. I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have done it. I was wrong. You were worse than wrong. You were stupid. In my home in Paraguay... the men who can bring the neo-Nazi movement back into full power wait for us. Depend on us. - I didn't think that... PORTILLO: How much money did you take? How much money did you spend in Munich? Not much. Uh, I can't say exactly. He can't say exactly. Hmm. Each bundle is 1000 dollars. - How many did you take? - Not much, I swear. - A few hundred dollars, maybe. - A liar too, huh? - No. - A few hundred dollars... is not enough to alert the Munich police department. We agreed we'd sell the money, not pass it ourselves. And certainly not in Munich, so close to Tegernsee. They could never trace it here. No? But they have. Uh-huh. An American woman was arrested in Munich and released. She's here in Tegernsee now with an American intelligence agent. Your mindless behavior has led them virtually to our door! Herr Portillo, please, let me try to redeem myself. I'll take care of them. You can't take care of yourself. You know what you are, Mueller? You're a liability. Breakfast, Harry. - Amanda, you didn't have to do that. - Oh, I don't mind. - We could've had breakfast at the hotel. - Oh, it's okay. - Amanda. - Mm-hm? - I'll get you out of this, I promise. - I know you will. Good morning. I hope you found everything you needed last night. I guess I wasn't too great a host. I seem to have... Passed out. I'm a real disappointment to you, aren't I, Lee? It ever occur to you it's none of your damn business how much I drink? I'll get the coffee. Yeah. Ahem. They stick me out here a year and a half ago. Some kind of punishment duty. I guess I got a little sloppy on that Iraqi operation, I don't know. But Tegernsee? For a man with my experience? My training? My low boredom threshold? I'd feel sorry for you, Harry, but, uh, I don't wanna crowd the field. - Still not pulling your punches. - Uh-uh. Not for a friend. - Here. - Look, I would like to help you guys... but I don't know what's going on here. I'm out of it. Do you remember any of what I told you last night? Amanda was busted for passing a phony American 20. What else? Well, the, uh, plates go back for quite a while. Uh, they list Henry Morgenthau, Jr. As the Secretary of the Treasury. That means they go back to, what, about the mid-'30s, early '40s. You didn't tell me that. - What does it mean? - I think Harry knows what it means. Counterfeit plates dating back to the Third Reich. - Hitler? - Right. Counterfeit plates were designed by Hitler's regime... as a means of destroying the economies of the enemy. If a set of those plates has surfaced now, and if we get our hands on them... You and me working together? - What do you mean, "if"? - I don't know what would stop us. Right. I mean, where were you, for God's sake? Huh? I was right behind you. - No, you weren't. - I was covering your ass. The point is, Harry, we lost him. I told you we should've started moving faster. We moved plenty fast. He just moved faster. Amanda? AMANDA: Yeah? You can come out now, it's all clear. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Why did they shoot at us? That's a good question. Why did they shoot at us? Well, maybe I'm being overly modest, but I don't think I'm a candidate... - for assassination. - One of us? Listen. You're welcome to stay as long as you want... but it's a good idea to get Amanda back to Munich. - I don't wanna see the lady get hurt. - Right. And what is the lady doing in Tegernsee? You can imagine my surprise when I called your hotel and was told you had left. Well, you told us that we, um... You didn't say that we couldn't leave Munich. You just said that we couldn't leave Germany, and here we are... still in Germany. Come on, we left word at the hotel where we could be reached. We just came up here to have a little breakfast with, uh, Harry. With devastating effect, it would appear. You are a most unusual tourist, Mrs. King. Most unusual. I mean, one is accustomed to dealing with stolen travelers' checks... traffic accidents, that sort of thing. But with you, we have counterfeit money, attempted assassination. - I take it you're with the Munich police. - Lieutenant Volkenauer. I don't mean to sound inhospitable, but you're out of your jurisdiction. Wherever Frau King chooses to go, that is my jurisdiction. Did you see the look in his eye? He thinks I'm guilty. Amanda, he's a cop. It's his job to think you're guilty. Now, that might've been phrased a little better. It wasn't very reassuring. Ah, civilians. Amanda. Look, Amanda, about Volkenauer, there is... Lee, look. Look. What? AMANDA: You see that funny boat? It's not a sailboat, and it's not one of those little electric boats. It's a weird boat. And look on the deck, you can see little tiny divers. Harry, if the Third Reich did make these counterfeit plates... where have they been all this time? Buried? Could they have been in a lake? Well, a lot of their loot was disposed of that way, yeah. How about that lake? You mean those divers could be looking for Nazi loot? Harry, that's a fully rigged workboat. Divers. We better get out there and talk to those divers. We saw you from the terrace up there. It's quite an outfit you've got. Been here long? Five, six weeks, perhaps. We have permit. That's what schnapps'll do for you. I never noticed it. What are you looking for? No, no, I just mean are you looking for anything special or, you know...? - Nein, we just look. - Oh. We're not interested in competing with you. We're interested in something that may have already been found. Nothing is found. Not by us. I see, well, we were told that this, uh, lake is an old Nazi dumping ground. You know, old war treasures. Der Alte? Old Gunther. Let's go. Harry. What about this Old Gunther? He's something of the local historian. About 80 years old. Kind of a legend around here. Well, why don't we pay him a visit, huh? Now, he should be around here somewhere. What makes you think that he's gonna talk to us? - I'm not sure he will. - Oh, look, he'll probably welcome company. Herr Gunther. Herr Gunther. You're right, Amanda. The old guy is obviously starved for company. Well, look, he wasn't expecting us, Harry. Maybe if you just tell him who we are. Herr Gunther. Too many people. Who else has he talked to besides the two kids in the workboat? I don't think we're gonna get anywhere. Harry, does he know how important this is? If he won't talk to us, I'm not gonna be able to go home. Please, sir. I have two little boys. And they're never gonna understand why I can't leave Germany... because of something Hitler did. I don't even understand it myself. Amanda, he doesn't speak English. Huh? - Speak. - You do? - He does. - Herr Gunther... we spoke to two young men who said you told them... that the lake was used as a hiding place for war treasures. - Is that true? - Ja. I see this. You saw it? You actually witnessed the dumping? Ja. Unter Offizier Mueller put in lake, leave. Nobody come to take out. Besides the two young men, who else have you told about this? Werner. When Mueller die six months ago... maybe his boy come to me. Talk, talk, ask question. I tell him what I see... there is box in lake. He don't come back. Werner Mueller. You know him? No, but if he's local, I can get a line on him. - Hmm. - You can go home now. If we can find Mr. Mueller, I think so. Thank you very much. I got it. - That was quick. - Yeah. I phoned the bartender at Bachmair Hotel. He knows everyone. Of course, I know him. He said Mueller lives just outside of town. Did he tell you anything else? - Yeah. He used to be the local milkman. Quit his job a few months back... six months back, but he's not hurting for cash. He bought a new car, had his house painted. I'd say we've got our guy. - A milkman? - Well, what's wrong with that? His father is a noncom in the Wehrmacht. He dumps the plates and whatever else in the lake. Six months ago, he makes a deathbed confession to his son... but neglects to say where in the lake. Now, Old Gunther supplies that information. - I'd say it all tracks. - But a milkman? - Why do you keep saying that? - It just doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem like a milkman would know anything about counterfeiting. Wouldn't you have to have special paper and special ink? I thought you said she was a civilian. - Uh, yeah, she is. Slow down. Mueller's house should be right at the end of the street. He's dead. His arm, that's what I was going for. His arm. At least we got the right guy. Yeah, but our only lead. I guess you were right. Hell, I know you were right. I've been spending too much time in that bottle. Is he...? HARRY: Yeah. Deadeye Dick here took real good care of him. Harry, will you stop beating your chest about it? But I was only trying to wing him. I should've been able to do that blindfolded. I know. The agency knew what they were doing when they sent me out here. I've lost it. AMANDA: Harry. - If I ever had it. - Harry. You saved Lee's life. I also didn't hit what I was aiming at. Now, he was our only lead. - Where do we go from here? - Probably to the nearest slammer. Back to jail? Unless I can come up with a decent explanation... which, even for me, is gonna be tough. So... I know how this must look, sir... but there is a perfectly reasonable explanation. Tell him, Lee. Look, Lee, I know you're upset but you had to tell them who we are. You can't have the police think we're tourists... who just go around and shoot people. I know it's important to main... Excuse me. Maintain... Excuse me. Maintain your cover... - but under these circumstances... - Billy will understand. Oh, it made the agency look like a bunch of yo-yos. I have no authority to act in an official capacity in Germany, all right? Volkenauer could've thrown the book at me. He may still. We could wind up in an international incident. - An international incident? - Yes. Oh, my gosh, and it's all my fault. - If only I had looked at that money... - Amanda. - Hmm? - Who reads money, huh? Someone gives you a handful of cash, you check if the denominations are right... not who the Secretary of the Treasury is or serial numbers. It's not your fault. Cheer up. We might get thrown out of the country. - That'll get you home. - No, I don't wanna go home. I mean, I don't wanna go home that way. Not if Lee's disgraced. It's just... It's just not fair. - Hey. - Hmm? - Who ever promised you fair? - Nobody. I just keep expecting it somehow. Well, I guess we're pretty much dead in the water. - Not yet. - With Mueller out of the picture? What about known associates? Counterfeiting isn't a one-man operation, is it? Now, I don't think the lieutenant's gonna like it very much if we do anything else. He's furious already. But that's American money they're cranking out. I want those plates. Known associates. You know, you're right. Mueller was a local boy, a milkman. He didn't have any big city contacts. His contacts were probably here in Tegernsee or here in Bad Tölz. Yeah, but how are we gonna find out who they are? The old-fashioned way. We ask questions. Right. I've probably got a better handle on Tegernsee, so I'll stay here. Okay, we'll take the other side of the lake in Bad Tölz. - Meet back here in an hour. - You got it. We're gonna do it, pal. Just like old times. Did you see that? Did you see how excited he is? I know you were a little disappointed with him when we first got here. But you see the way he is now? Just like you described him. He's on top of it, he's together, he's the best. - Almost the best. - Yeah. Amanda. Come on. We have to kill him. The minute he showed up, he was gonna be trouble. And he's about that far from blowing this whole setup. We have to kill him? It's interesting that a problem uniquely yours should become ours. What I'm saying is... You're saying you can't live up to our agreement. I have lived up to it. I even took care of Mueller for you. For me or for yourself? You know, Harry, in many ways, you remind me of Mueller. You're very much the greedy, irresponsible child. Are you gonna stand around here insulting me, Portillo... or do you wanna know the trouble we're in? Now, Scarecrow is the best operative I've ever worked with. He is tough and he is smart. And this tap dance I've been doing is wearing real thin. - Then dispose of him. - I need your help. But help was what you offered me, for a percentage. You insinuated into this enterprise... with the assurance that any authorities would be handled. I have deflected every investigation... that looked like it was coming near you. Except the one that could blow this whole setup. I'd say you disappoint me, Harry, but that would imply respect. I'm sure you won't be hurt... if I don't lose sleep over what some neo-Nazi thinks of me. - Our orders were... - Fascist garbage in my book, pal. But you value my opinion about as much as I value yours. What counts is... that we are in a hell of a lot of trouble if Scarecrow is not taken out now. What about the woman? I'll take care of her. Believe it or not, Portillo, I have a plan. I bet there's a telephone here somewhere. - There probably is. - Well, we have a few minutes. - For what? - I'd like to call my mother. The connection last night was terrible. I don't think she understood a word I said. Count yourself lucky and forget about it. Lee, I cannot just forget about it. I want my mother to know that I was arrested. Now, I know you may not agree with me, but it could've happened to anybody. And I don't want her to think I'm just over here having a high-heel good time. - What's wrong with that? - It's not the truth. The tru...? Amanda, the truth, sometimes it's highly overrated, you know that? Now, you know you don't mean that. - Right, you want her to worry? - No, of course not. - Are the kids all right? - Yes, they're fine. - Well... - Well? - So? - So what? So what? Look. You're a good mother, you love your family, you're a responsible person... - Oh, Lee. - What? - Well, that's really very sweet. - Yeah, in certain areas. And that was very underhanded. - Lee. Pal, things are really starting to turn around. I have got a terrific lead. Yeah, so do I. There's a man named Karl Portillo. He's from Paraguay. Werner Mueller has been seen entering his chalet in Tegernsee... frequently in the past few months. I don't think he was delivering milk. Yeah, you're right. It could be worth looking into. Could be? Harry, there's a large neo-Nazi movement in Paraguay. The plates are of Nazi origin, right? I think the two... The two go together perfectly well. Well, I said it could be worth looking into, but what I've got is really hot. Mueller has a cousin who runs a sawmill... on the outskirts of Munich, place called Solln. Now, my information, which is very inside... says that he and this cousin have been joined at the hip for the last six months. And they have been spending a lot of money. So you wanna hit the sawmill? You've got it. If we have a conversation with Mueller's cousin... I guarantee you we can wrap up this whole counterfeit ring. Ah, you may be right. - I know I'm right. I'm on a roll. - Look, I'm gonna go check in with Billy. Why do that now? Wait till we get it all wrapped up. - Well, you know Billy. - Yeah. If I check in late, he's liable to call out the troops and blow the deal. Okay, well, uh, tell him you got a good lead but fill in the details later. Yeah, right. You think we can have this whole thing wrapped up in one day? There's not a doubt in my mind. I don't know why I have to stay here. - It's a party. Enjoy. - No, look, I could wait in the car. I could go for help if anything went wrong. Amanda, we do not know what we're going to run into at that sawmill. All right? Now, Harry and I are trained for whatever happens. We can take care of ourselves, but I can't if I worry about you. - Listen to me. Just for a... - No. That's exactly my point. - Just for... AMANDA: No, you might need help. For a change, will you do what I ask you? That's not very nice to say, "Just for a change." I'm good at following orders when they are clear. Then follow this one. Stay here. We'll come back and get you when it's all over. When it's all over? What if there are a lot of them? I could wait in the car, I could be a lookout. I could honk the horn if I saw anyone coming. I will stay here. Please be careful. Well, it looks deserted. The workers are at the festival. Whoever's in there is probably who we're after. - Ready? - Let's do it. You're German. Do you know what you're doing, huh? - Our cause is the same. - No, it is not the same. And what I have done, I have done with a great deal of pleasure. Where the hell were you? I was fascinated to watch an American operative in action. - Oh. - Just like John Wayne. Thanks. This would be your Señor Portillo. Not mine. You are much too modest, Herr Stetson. - Impetuous, but modest. - Hmm. Your pleasure is not so great as mine. - Herr Hollinger was your friend. - Yeah. He was my friend. - Where do you have him? - He never entered the mill. One of my men was assigned to your car. He will have him in custody. - Come on, what happened? - He has taken your car. He is gone. Amanda. - Make a good souvenir for the kids. - Harry. Ha. You startled me. - Where's Lee? - I told you I'd take care of him. - You thinking of buying that? - Uh, no, I didn't bring any money. Don't let a little thing like money worry you. I'll buy it for you. You look surprised, Amanda. Lee didn't clue you in, did he? Where is Lee? What have you done? If Lee had never been involved, this thing would've been a whole lot easier. - Harry, answer my question. - I set him up with Portillo and his goons. - Set him up? - It evens out. He did the same to me. He had the mill staked out when I got there. I don't know how he did it. He's a half-length ahead of me. You wouldn't mind being my insurance policy, would you? All right, now stay here. This is his only way out. That's enough, Amanda. No more games. You always did have a killer right. You understand, pal. It was nothing personal. Wrong again, Harry. It was very personal. What's gonna happen to Harry? They're gonna throw the book at him. Gee, that's too bad. You know, if when Harry discovered that counterfeiting ring... he had just told the agency about it instead of throwing in with them... he probably would've been a hero and he could've had any assignment he wanted. It's funny you could figure that out and Harry couldn't. Well, it's logical. - And you're a very logical person. - Yes, I am. How did you figure out that Harry was one of the counterfeiters? It was a couple of things. First of all, his lifestyle. No matter how good the rate of exchange is... he could never afford that chalet. Yeah? You said a couple of things. Well, the clincher was that morning at breakfast. I'd asked him if he remembered our conversation from the night before. He remembered counterfeit 20s. - I never mentioned 20-dollar bills. - Oh, very clever of you. - Well, thank you. - Frau King. I thought the police were finished with us. Uh, one question. Frau King, I don't wish to detain you any further... - but, uh, one question. - Yes. What are you doing for dinner this evening? - Perhaps a typical Bavarian meal? - Thank you very much... but I think I'll be having dinner with my family tonight in Arlington, Virginia. Or breakfast, whichever it is. Anyway, I think I'll be eating at home. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
