 Keaton here, station two. What do you make of our fisherman friend there? He's on the barge. He's heading inside. Shall I intercept? Negative. Hold all positions. DeMarco's inside with the wire on. If the old man's part of the action, we'll soon know. Maintain the plan. As soon as the deal is done, we move in. That's some getup, mate. You're late, Mr... People who know my name don't tend to live very long. Now, there's no need for anybody to get jumpy.

 Let's just do the business. Ned? Excellent. And I have something for you. [SILENCED GUNSHOT] Sorry. Clumsy of me. What the hell? It's all right, boys. I'll check the money, make sure it's all there. Inspector Keaton, you may come in now and collect your rubbish. All units, move now. Come on. Check the front. MAN: He went out the front hatch! Inspector Keaton.

 This was on DeMarco's body. My God, it's him. LEE: It was the Mongoose, all right, Billy. Complete with his calling card. DeMarco works with the British on a diamond bust... and he runs smack into the Mongoose. BILLY: What else? Well, after two days, all we have is what we found in his pockets. A casino chip. A piece of paper with "Conrad Walter Barnhill" written on it. We made progress on that name, Scarecrow. The computer gave us someone who can ID this Barnhill character. That's great. Yeah, that's great. Look, it's clear that DeMarco did some good old agent footwork... between the setup meeting and the barge. If he stumbled on the Mongoose's name and we have someone to put a face on it... we could nail this guy right here in London. Well, the person that can make that identification is on the way into London... in about an hour, on Flight 171. Great, who is it? Billy? Who am I meeting? [PHONE LINE CLICKS] Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I mean, I got to the airport. I went to the baggage claim. I picked up my bags, or what I thought were my bags. They look like my bags. They're brown with a stripe. I went through customs. I got onto the bus. I opened my small bag to get my hairbrush out and look what came out. Whoa. Career girl. And look, these things belong to a Miss Trixie Berlinger. I've gotta get her clothes back to her. Are you sure you wanna return this stuff? Could be a whole new you. Lee, I'm serious. I feel terrible about this. Amanda, I know you are sorry. You can just bet Trixie is sorry. I know I'm sorry. Do you think we might put all this sorrow behind us and get back to work? I'm sorry. I'm... It's just that I've been in the same clothes for 12 hours and... - Only 12? - London is such a beautiful... What do you mean only 12? Nothing. Nothing. I can't belie... You are the one who knows Conrad Walter Barnhill. Connie Barnhill. We went to high school together. I don't wanna see any old friends in clothes that I've been in for 12 hours. Amanda, this business with Barnhill is not gonna be some class reunion. - It's about... - Lee. - What? - I have nothing to wear. Okay. Okay. I will contact TWA. They're very good... and they will help you figure out this whole luggage problem. Then I will take you shopping. Oh. No. - You don't have to do that. - No, I insist. I can't believe I'm insisting, but I am. Well, let's just remember that this is an honest mistake... that could have happened to anyone. LEE: What does your mother think you're doing in London? Well, I told her that my boss wanted me to look up an old high school friend. - She bought that? - Sure, she did. It's the truth, isn't it? I even told her that it was Connie Barnhill. You know, she even remembers him vaguely. Well, it is the truth. Look, all you have to do is point him out to me, then you can head home. - Yeah, well, Lee... - Here. Let's sit down. I don't understand how you can actually believe... that Connie Barnhill is an international hitman. What did you call him? The Mongoose. It's a perfect name for him. He's... He's ruthless. He's very smart, very elusive. - A master of disguise. - All right. What has the Mongoose done recently? Oh, not too much. Just killed three men and helped himself to 5 million dollars' worth of stolen diamonds. He intends to start a syndicate of international hitmen headed by himself. The diamonds are to finance his operation. Lee, I would never tell you how to do your job. Oh. Okay. But this time, I really think I'm right. Now, Conrad Barnhill may not have been blessed with many of the social graces... and he may have had that little dandruff problem, but still... he was never a violent person. Well, that's the kid that you remember. Let me tell you about the man that became the Mongoose. Now, to date, 42 murders throughout the world that have been attributed to him. So that's the reason the agency brought me over here... to identify him because you don't have a picture? Yeah, that's about it. We found a copy of your high school yearbook. Instead of a photo, there was a notice that he was absent. No. He wasn't absent that day. - No? - No. He locked himself in the chemistry lab by mistake. Amanda, he doesn't even have a passport photo on file. He somehow replaced that with one of his calling cards. See, that's his style. He's arrogant. He's always thumbing his nose at us. You think we'll find the Mongoose at this casino? It's called the Terrace Club. That was found on the body of one of our agents. Oof. It matches his lifestyle. He's a high roller. He likes excitement. No, no. I just have to tell you that this is not my Connie Barnhill. Can't be the same person. DEALER: House, 19. Twenty and 21 win. I knew that queen would be luck for you. Oh, you've been right every time. Thank you so much. Oh. Look. DEALER: Place your bets. - Are your eyes open? I've been watching just like you said. Good. I don't want him slipping by because you're scooping up your winnings. It was your idea that we should act naturally... - and play while we're on the stakeout. - Yes, and try to remember that. I can't help it if I'm winning. Look, Amanda, two fives. Now, remember what I told you. Right. Double down. DEALER: Queen. - Oh, God. DEALER: House, 19. Twenty, 21 win. It's no use. He's not gonna show. Here, just take some of my chips. I've got too many anyway. Go ahead. Just keep on playing. Shh, shh. Please don't knock them out of their stack. I'm gonna call Billy, tell him the trail's gone cold. DEALER: Place your bets, please. Amanda, this has been delightful. Think you can carry on without me? - You're not leaving? - I think I'd better. I'm a few pounds to the good and I never like to press my luck. Good night. I'm fortunate to have had such a lovely fellow player. Until we meet again. Night. - Madam? - Yes. MAN: Amanda, don't turn around. Conrad? Conrad, is that really you? Some people know me by another name. - Let's move over to the slot machine. - Right. - Without turning around. - Sorry. - Should I play? - Yes. Thank you. - How did you know it was me? - Oh, you have a distinctive voice. You always have. We have to talk, Amanda. Conrad, are you doing something that's really wrong? We can talk tomorrow. Meet me at Trafalgar Square at 10:00. Lose your boyfriend with the perfect hair first. He's not my boyfriend. DEALER: Seven or 17. Conrad, you know, it's really awfully difficult for me to believe... that you're some kind of an international criminal. I mean, I remember what a nice person you were, and smart too and... I remember the time you won the science fair with your solar-powered ant farm. You were always just a little bit ahead of your time. Connie? [AMANDA CHUCKLES] [AMANDA CLEARS THROAT] Billy, I can't help it if the Mongoose never showed up. Yes. Yes, I'm aware of that. Amanda's fine. She's playing blackjack. Winning too. Listen, I'll call you if anything breaks, okay? You got it. Okay. Goodbye. [GRUNTING] AMANDA: Lee? Lee. Lee. Oh, my gosh. Lee? Lee, are you all right? Amanda. Are you all right? I will be once you get off my arm. I'm sorry. - Help me up, will you? - Yeah. - Amanda. - Yeah? - Our man was here. - I know, I talked to Conrad. Yeah. Just tried to show me his necktie trick. - When did he leave you? - I don't know. He was behind me... but he told me to meet him at Trafalgar Square at 10:00 and to be alone. Not very sociable of him. I turned around and he was gone. Had a pressing engagement with my throat. I really don't think that Conrad is capable of strangling anyone. With a silk scarf. No. That definitely doesn't sound like my Conrad. It may not sound like your Conrad, but it definitely sounds like my Mongoose. ALBY: You're late. But you didn't mind waiting. Anything for diamonds. The drop points are set? - In concrete. - We're agreed on the price per pouch? Now, you know what an agreeable sort of fellow I am. I take that to mean yes. - You okay? - Yes. I've never seen Trafalgar Square before. I would have hoped I could move around a little. Move around, he may kill you. Well, there's a lot to see from here too. This is a farce. The bloody Mongoose is making fools of us again. Yeah, damn it, it's almost noon. - We might as well call it all off. - I couldn't agree more. Okay, boys, it's a wash. - What's the matter? Your feet hurt? - Oh, just a little. It's these new shoes. I should've worn my old ones. Are you sure Conrad said 10:00? Yes, but he's not always the most punctual person. Yeah, well, he's almost two hours late now. He used to have an old pocket watch that his grandfather gave him. Do you suppose he still has it? Well, that question is certainly uppermost in my mind right now. Lee, it's very important because that watch ran slow... and Connie was always late for everything. I have known this man to plan a kill when he had less than 10 seconds for the hit. - No, he's playing with us again. - Oh, well. All right, I'm gonna give Billy a call, give him an update. He's gonna be thrilled with this. Well, look, do you mind if I do some shopping? No, I don't mind. With your money. Oh. Can you pick me up some Dulon Doux Camembert cheese? - It's at Harrods. - No. Not all. With your money. Huh. One more. Better give me another. See you later, Bob. [MOUTHING] Bob? Oof. CONRAD: That stuff stinks. - Hi. Conrad. - Hi, Amanda. - Oh. Where were you? You said 10:00. - Remember this? - Sure. Same old Conrad. Not quite. Now I always turn up late. Keeps the opposition off guard. It's not the watch. I had that fixed. Opposition? Oh, but, Connie, I'm not the opposition. Remember, I'm Amanda. - I'm your friend. - Sure. Let's have a drink. Tailing you is thirsty work. So you're telling me you are the Mongoose. Shh. Not so loud. So how did you become an agent? What do you mean an agent? Come on, I know you came over here to ID me. ID you? The Mongoose knows everything. Oh, Connie, even hearing you say it, I can't believe it. I know about the Mongoose. He's supposed to be quick and elusive and you flunked gym two years in a row. Gym isn't important. You should talk. You were a cheerleader. You loved watching the football team bump into each other. But now you're some sort of hotshot agent. Well, I'm not really a hotshot age... I'm... I'm more like a candy striper agent. Sort of in training. Yeah, and I don't think I'm gonna go much higher. - You married? - No. Divorced. Oh, but I do have two little boys, Connie. Philip, 10, and Jamie, 8. - That's nice. - Yes. Oh, Connie. If you're the Mongoose, you've done some really terrible things. Well, it wasn't easy, Amanda. You'd be surprised what a man is capable of once he realizes his full potential. [MOUTHING INAUDIBLY] You know, they booed Laurence Olivier off the stage when he was 18. Well, Conrad Walter Barnhill isn't 18 anymore. - You have kids. - Right. Mm-hm. Right. So you're not just Amanda... the cute girl in the back of the chemistry class anymore, are you? Your life is different. You choose to be a mother. And I... How about a game of darts? Darts? Hey! Hey, you bloody fool! Stop! Cabbie, here's 20 pounds. Lose the cab tailing us. [AMANDA SCREAMS] AMANDA: Oh, Conrad, why are you doing this? I'm sorry, Amanda. LEE: Hold it. Drop it or I drop her. He is the Mongoose. Not a fun situation, is it, Mr. Stetson? You may get me, but I most assuredly will get her. What put you onto me? I've known who you were since you stepped foot in the casino. I didn't know how you were using Amanda. It's funny, you can never trust a cheerleader. - Conrad, why are you doing this? - You wouldn't listen to me. Me either. - How could I believe he was the Mongoose? - Does this help? Conrad, put that away. You were never good with things that are mechanical. Well, I got better over the years. Hey, back up, pal. [GUN COCKS] One more step and she gets it. He's gonna shoot me, Lee. I'm gonna shoot her. AMANDA: Lee. CONRAD: Hey, I'll shoot her. AMANDA: Lee. I'm not kidding, pal. - One more step and she gets it right bet... AMANDA: No! Not with this, you're not. It wasn't loaded. I wasn't gonna hurt her. I lied. I'm not the Mongoose. Please don't hate me, Amanda. I don't hate you, Conrad. I lied. I wasn't gonna... I think Mr. Barnhill has a few questions to answer, don't you? I'm sorry, Aman... LEE: Cyprus, July, 1976. An explosion in the church. July of 1976, I was working as a shoe salesman in Maryland. - Last year's four-man hit in Sicily. - I've never been to Sicily. Please, I've told you and told you, I'm not the Mongoose. If I was the Mongoose, I would have killed Amanda. I didn't. LEE: So you're not the Mongoose. But if you don't wanna spend 20 years behind bars, tell us what you do know. Okay, I'll talk. But I want Amanda to be here. So it's called Good Guy, Bad Guy? One guy questions the suspect, he's mean and rough. Other guy plays nice as a buffer to the mean guy. - Which side is the good guy on? - Bad guy. - But he's good? - Right. - Then who's really bad? - The bad guy. Uh, the suspect. - Got it? - Sure, but it's too complicated. I think maybe I should just talk to Conrad. He always used to confide in me. He even told me he wears his undershorts inside-out so the seams don't scratch him. Well, since underwear is not on the schedule today... could we try to stick to the proven technique? Right. Good Guy, Bad Guy. Uh, Lee. It makes me feel just awful when I have to scold a boy. So I think I should probably be the good guy... and if you don't mind, you should be the bad guy. Good idea. Let's go. LEE: Okay, creep, from the top. Amanda, are you there? AMANDA: Yes, Connie, I'm still here. There. Is that better? Yes, thank you. Maybe I ought to soften up your face, it might just make you talk a little easier. AMANDA: Oh, Lee. Connie, would you like for me to get you a cup of coffee or soft drink or something? Thank you. Or how about a pillow or an in-flight movie? You think some information might drop out if I bounce you off the walls a little bit? Lee. Put him down, you might hurt him. Oh. Stay put. - Amanda. - Yes? - Could I talk to you for a moment? - Certainly. I'll be right back, Connie. Okay. What's the matter? That's as good a good guy as I can be. - Mother Theresa was never that good. - Ooh. I know. I'm sorry. It's my fault, maybe I didn't explain it right. Look, you said the good guy acted like a buffer. Okay, so I buffered. Yeah, every two seconds. Now, Amanda, the technique works better... if you let the bad guy play his part, then the good guy takes over. But by that time, Connie will be scared to death. That's the whole point, get him scared enough to talk. I mean, it's an interrogation, remember? Conrad does not respond well to fear. I think we both should be the good guy. Oh, come on, there's no such thing as Good Guy, Good Guy. Okay. Then just let me do it alone. All right. All right, he is all yours. I will be listening from the next room. I cannot stand a brutal interrogation. [CONRAD & AMANDA LAUGHING ON RECORDING] CONRAD: High school, boy, those were good days. AMANDA: Oh, yeah, they were. Oh, Connie, how did you get involved in all this Mongoose stuff? CONRAD: I wanted to be somebody. Oh, but you are somebody. You're Conrad Walter Barnhill. I really wanted to be somebody else. About eight months ago, I came to Europe, you know, to start over. Lead a fast and exciting life. I met this guy. He said he was a rich industrialist. I got a job as his assistant. All I did was run errands, but the pay was really good. There was travel and fancy cars. I was important. For the first time in my life, I was really important. Then I found out that these little errands involved illegal transactions. I told him what I knew and I learned he was the Mongoose. But, Connie, why didn't you just quit? CONRAD: He said he'd kill me. He told me in great detail how he had terminated other helpers that he'd had. AMANDA: You should have gone to the police. I wanted to, but he seemed to know where I was and what I was doing. He's got eyes and ears everywhere. The Mongoose is the most frightening man I've ever met in my life. I'm scared, really scared. You gotta help me. Now, Connie, no. Don't be afraid. Because Mr. Stetson and I will get you out of this mess. CONRAD: I know what he looks like, but I don't know his name. Thanks a lot. I don't know where he lives. - I'm sorry you got dragged into this. - Don't you worry about me. I'm kind of worried about you. At the casino, I acted really cold and mean to you... because the Mongoose told me I had to impersonate him. What I wanted to do was throw my arms around you and give you a hug. Singing like a jaybird. She's good, you know. She has her own style. Amanda, there's something I've always wanted to tell you. Yeah. CONRAD: I know this is not the best time or place or anything like that... but I really feel I have to say it. Say what, Connie? I love you, Amanda. - I've always loved you. AMANDA: Oh, Connie. CONRAD: I never had the courage to say it before and I... I know you can't love me or anything, but I wanted you to know how I felt. Uh, sometimes an interrogation takes some bizarre twists. AMANDA: Connie... I want you to know that you've always been very special to me. And you are now. I feel silly right now. No, don't you feel silly. You just be Connie Barnhill, because I really like him. Mr. Barnhill, you now have two choices. You can go free, in which case the Mongoose will most probably kill you... or you can help us to identify the Mongoose... in which case, we will protect you. Are you being the bad guy again? Yes. And you are going home to your children. I'll have your luggage sent when it's found. Good. - We can take you to the airport in a limo. - Thank you very much... but I really do wanna ride on the double-decker bus. Unless, of course, you're, you know, worried about me. What's to worry about? Nothing. I hope you can use the information that Conrad gave me... to catch the Mongoose. Well, we're sure gonna try. Listen... Amanda... you were right about Conrad. You did get him to talk. So... - You're welcome. - You're gonna miss your bus. Well, goodbye. Take care of yourself... and please take good care of Conrad. All he has to do is point out the Mongoose. Oh, just remember, Conrad has a way of getting himself into trouble. Like someone else I know. Oh! Bye. Oh, hello. How nice to see you again. Yes, yes, how fortuitous. I have a matter that needs attending. I wonder if you could help me. Oh, I'd love to, but I'm sorry. I'm on my way to the airport. You have a small detour planned. No, I don't. Perhaps we should be properly introduced. Oh. Thank you. You're now working for me. Outside perimeter secure? KEATON [OVER RADIO]: As a bug in a rug, old man. Roger. Are you sure about this? Conrad, the Mongoose had you memorize a five-stop walking tour of London. - Right? - Right. Well, he has to exchange those diamonds for cash. Based on what I know of him... he'd never make one drop. He'd keep on the move and make several. But you're just covering Covent Garden. Scotland Yard doesn't have enough men to blanket each drop. I've got lookouts on all four of them... but this is where we're gonna throw the net over him. I hope he comes. Keep your eyes open and point him out to me. He'll come, I promise you. I know he'll come. That's three officers I've spotted so far. Stetson's no fool, a worthy adversary. He figured it out from what that idiot Conrad could tell him. I'll be skipping Covent Garden. We'll start somewhere else. - Where are we going? - The Tower of London. Oh. Well, you know... Ow. - -someone could spot me along the way. Lee will definitely have other men placed along the tour. Not this many. If there are others, it adds risk to the game. Oh, gee. But you kill people. Part of the fun. Now, you, my little dear, will do exactly as Conrad. At each drop, you exchange a pouch of diamonds for $1 million. What are you gonna do to me when it's over? Oh. Hello. - What can I do for you? - I think I have something you want. No doubt of that. And I think you have something I want. - This is getting better all the time. - I mean the diamonds. I thought the Mongoose had them. He gave them to me. Do you have the money? Yeah, yeah, I've got that... but if you've got the diamonds, why don't you show me how they sparkle? Now, if you have the money... why don't you show me how it shines? Paper money, sweetheart. It doesn't shine. Sorry. Oh. Fine. How do I know that there is exactly a million dollars in there? Don't you trust me? Honesty is not exactly your strong suit, sir. And the Mongoose will be very angry with both us... if I don't bring back exactly $1 million. Well, how do I know the Mongoose is around? He is here. And he will kill us. Now it's a million dollars. Everybody's happy. Bye, now. He's gotta come. I know the man, he's not gonna turn away from that kind of money. So where is he? I don't know. Maybe he spotted us. He's afraid of you, the only one who can recognize him. Yeah, just me. And Amanda. Amanda? She was sitting next to him at the casino. - Well, why didn't you tell me that? - I didn't think it was important. She doesn't know she sat next to him, or what he looks like. But the Mongoose knows what Amanda looks like. Amanda's safe. She's on her way home on a plane. Scarecrow. Delta-Zero-Zero-Zero. Patch in to Washington, D.C. BILLY [OVER RADIO]: What's wrong, Scarecrow? Billy, do me a favor. Check the airline's computers, see if Amanda made her flight back to the States. You've got it. You don't think the Mongoose has Amanda? Since we have you, he needs someone else to be his drop man for the diamonds. It'd amuse him a great deal to use one of our own people. BILLY: Negative. She never got on the plane. What the hell's happening? I'll check with you later, Billy. He's got her. Damn it. I knew I should've taken her to the airport myself. Amanda's in trouble, now we gotta think. Okay. Now, what would I do if I were the Mongoose? Start the pickup somewhere else. Start at the opposite end of the tour. That means Willins, Tower of London, right? Willins, report in, over. Willins, come in. LEE [OVER RADIO]: Willins? Report in, over. Willins, come in. This is Scarecrow, over. Maybe his walkie-talkie is on the blink. Yeah, courtesy of the Mongoose. He's got Amanda. Where are they? Keaton, get your men to the other drops. I'm taking St. Katharine's Dock. Right now. KEATON: Roger, Scarecrow. Come on. MONGOOSE: His name is Rogsin. Remember, I'll be close by. I have two little boys. I just thought you should know that. Do your job with Mr. Rogsin properly and you may live to see them again. - Hey, I thought you had a lookout here. - Yeah. I'm afraid whatever happened to Willins happened to our man. - Come on. This way. - Right. LEE: There. You get ahold of Keaton, you tell him to get over here fast. Right. Hello, Keaton. This is Conrad. Come in. Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a minute? [AMANDA GASPS] How did you know I was here? Look, it's a long story. Where is he? The last time I saw him, he was by his car. I moved. Throw your gun into the water, Mr. Stetson. Come on, come on. And I will take that. Oh, yes. [SILENCED GUNSHOT] LEE: Go on. - Aah! - Lee, watch it. Dagger, right sleeve. - Charming. Oh, Conrad. Oh, that was a very brave thing to do. It was the first really brave thing I ever did in my life. Really stupid too. - Ow! - Oh, I'm sorry. MONGOOSE: Stand back. Stand back. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [YELLS] He's all yours, boys. Get the shark out of my sight. OFFICER 1: Come on. Come on. That's it. - Go on. OFFICER 2: Easy does it. Easy does it. Does it hurt much, Connie? - No, it's okay. - Good. What hurts is we have to say goodbye again. Yeah, but it won't be forever. Don't forget what I said at Scotland Yard. It's true, you know. It'll always be true. Thank you, Conrad. - Be careful. CONRAD: Okay, I got it. - You're late. - My apologies on that. Yeah, well, you'll find our friend in the Thames. AMANDA: Be careful, Conrad. Conrad, when are you gonna learn which is your right hand and which is your...? - When, huh? - I'm sorry. Did I screw up again? No, it's... You've... Well, it... Don't worry about it. The important thing is that the Mongoose has got cuffs on both hands right now. Lee, Amanda, I gotta thank you guys. I mean, you bailed me out of a whole lot of trouble. - Well, what are friends for? - Aw. What are friends for? [AMANDA & LEE CHUCKLE] AMANDA: I can't believe it. I am actually here at Buckingham Palace. The royal residence. Yeah, heh, heh, heh. Amanda, Lee. AMANDA: Hi, Connie. - Conrad. - Did you see the morning papers? - No. Oh. "Mongoose caught. American citizen aids in arrest of international killer." Oh, Connie. You're gonna be the hit at the next class reunion. Well, fame and success can only come to a few of us. I gotta run. I got a radio interview. The British love their heroes. Lee, let's work together again sometime. - Yeah, Conrad it was interesting. CONRAD: Hey, don't mention it, pal. Amanda. Bye-bye. I'll... I'll see you back in the States. Yeah, Connie. Fix your tie, Conrad. Bye. Hey, listen. I gotta go. [LEE CHUCKLES] Bless his heart, he's about to bust. Yeah. Oh, look, Amanda, you have all afternoon before your flight. - Mm. - What are you going to do? Well, this may sound silly... but I've always promised myself that if I ever got to England... I would have a formal, proper afternoon British tea. Well, that's a good idea. There's some very famous, very posh places, you know. Oh, well, no, I think you have to know someone to get into those places. Well, I think I could help out there. I do have a little influence, you know, even here. Oh, Lee. Would you really do that? Anywhere you want, you just name the place and I'll take you there. I'd like to have tea there. At the palace. Where I belong. [LAUGHING] Oh, you.
