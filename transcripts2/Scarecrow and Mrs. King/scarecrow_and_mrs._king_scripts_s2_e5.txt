 Great. Just great. An Appalachian-style meet in our own backyard... and we can't get anywhere near it. The Perrine Invitational Automobile Exhibition is just that: invitational. We're not on the list. I mean, there's a chance that it's purely a social gathering. All right, there's not much of a chance. Ask yourself why Perrine's having a classic car exhibition on a polo field. - Because he owns the Equidome. - That is absolutely right. He controls the entire facility. When a man like Jerry Perrine gets together with men like these...

 - this country's in trouble. LEE: Yeah. The last time, it was that wheat sale to the East Bloc. That ended up costing the Agricultural Department approximately $200 million. These men control billions of dollars' worth of cash and credit. That kind of leverage, you're talking potential disaster. We still haven't found a way to get into the Equidome. - We're working on it. - The impossible takes a little longer. Longer is what we do not have, Billy. That meet starts tomorrow. - Hello, Amanda. AMANDA: Hello. - Hello, Lee. - Hello. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. I just brought you my expense voucher. Why don't we just bring a guy in as a telephone lineman? Something like that. He didn't get where he is by ignoring details. Was there something else, Amanda?

 Oh, well, no, sir. I just wanted to mention that I'll be very busy this weekend. But if anything vital comes up, you know you can always, uh... - We'd be in touch. - Yes, sir. If you have a minute, you might like to take a look at this program. For a very worthy cause. I'm actually refreshments director this year... but I still feel a responsibility for getting program sponsors. A full page is $400. - Amanda, what are you talking about? - Oh, the, uh, Unified Charity Funds Drive. Ah. Oh, no, no, no. No personal contributions. That's not until next week. This is for businesses like IFF. See, some companies take a full page and then some take a half page and... - Well, you know, that's only $200. LEE: Wait, Amanda. [CHUCKLES] Look, we don't want advertising. We really don't need customers, you know. Oh, no. Well, I'm... Of course you don't. But wouldn't it be good for your cover if you took an ad like a real business? I mean, now, think about it. A quarter page in a program like this at only $100. She's right. That's not such a bad idea. A hundred dollars? Well, sir, there is a section in the back that lists contributing sponsors. You get no advertising, but you are listed. And I think maybe the price would be right for you, sir. It's only $25 and it's tax deductible. And remember, it is for a very good cause. - Just our name, right? - Yes, sir. Just the name. Okay. Put us down as a supporter. Thank you, sir. I'm happy to take your order. - All right. Is that it? - Sorry, I... Can we get back to the business at hand? Yes, I'll just be going now. Thank you very much, and, uh... have a nice day. Cheer up. We'll cover all the entrances to the Equidome... take a lot of pictures and hope for a break. Oh, and make sure all of our men know these faces. Bruno Sarkisian and Bart Taggart. LEE: Ted Masterson and Jerry Perrine himself. What could they be cooking up? DOTTY: Amanda. Amanda. Yeah, Mother. - It's that woman. - Mrs. Coleman? Hello. Yes? Uh, yes. No, no, no. No trouble at all. Yes, sure. Yes, Mrs. Coleman. All right. Bye-bye. Don't tell me. Amanda, would you mind picking up a few things for me? I am so busy with the ambassadors and the senators and Nancy calling day and night. Mother, it's just the flowers. The flowers? The flowers are her department. You've already done all the decorating. Amanda, that woman is taking advantage of you. Mother, it's all right. It's for charity. This happens every year. You do all the work and then a woman like that gets all the credit. Now, there's an axiom for that exactly and it's, "The, uh, quality of charity is..." The quality of charity is to be nice to Mrs. Coleman. That is absolutely not it. I don't care. I still have to do it. Ugh. Pick anything up on the truck? Too much back noise, but we're running a check on the license. We gotta get inside, Billy. He's got that place buttoned and wired. We've worked to put him away and he knows it. There's always a way. It takes some thought and ingenuity. It's gonna take a lot more than that. Perrine's been under scrutiny by a dozen federal agencies for the past few years. He's an expert on seclusion. Oh, yeah? Well, we're supposed to be experts too, aren't we? We know that he's invited the wealthiest speculators in the country to this show. This could be the biggest deal so far and we can't get past that gate. That's right, Scarecrow. We can't get past that gate. Nobody we know can get past that gate. You don't have to play cat-and-mouse with me. Just lay out the deal and tell me what the figures are. Well, this is no deal for gun-jumpers, Ted. So I'm ambitious. Look, I gotta get something for myself before you own everything. Plus, you've got enough. I'm not sure there is enough. It's a beauty, isn't it? What I'm going to sell to the highest bidder. The world rights may go up to a hundred million. That's serious money. No, that's substantial money. Serious money is what can be made on the deal. - Then why are you selling? - Well, I don't want to, but I have to. I can't make a move without a flock of agents trailing after me. I would like to have kept Ghana and some local markets, like California... - but that wouldn't be prudent. - It's commodities, right? You're crowding me, Ted. I get the feeling you're under some pressure. The word's around the Bulgarians never paid for the microchips you sold them. Eight or 9 million. The commies don't understand our billing system. Look, when are we gonna know what the deal is exactly? Tomorrow, 2 p.m. Relax, Ted. Stop to smell the flowers. We got a station wagon. I'll run a make on the license. Never mind. We know who it is. What? Amanda. Amanda? DOTTY: What did poor Mrs. Coleman say after you picked up the flowers for her? I'm sure "thank you" was not mentioned anywhere. Not exactly, but she was very, very busy. - I'm not going to say another word. - Good. How does the Equidome look? Wonderful. The antique cars are lined up all over the polo field. The tables are set up, the decorations are up. Poor man. - Who? - Jerry Perrine. Everything material and he's all alone. I understand he lost his wife over a year ago. Mother, he lost her to a French baron and he seems pretty happy. That is a front, Amanda. A wealthy man like that is not going to announce his loneliness. I mean, he's too proud. Successful men do not like to admit that they have failed in love. You have a lot to learn about older men. Well, I am going to go upstairs and have my own kind of luxury now. - Bubble bath? - That's right. - Apricot cinnamon. I am dying to try it. - Mm. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Apricot cinnamon? DOTTY: Amanda, don't run any hot water until I'm finished. I won't, Mother. - How long have you been out here? - Just through the dishes. - I wanna talk to you. - Oh, I knew it. Something vital did come up at the agency. And the weekends are my busiest time. - Amanda, it's nothing like that. - It's all right. I can handle it. You just tell me what to do. Get me into the auto show at the Equidome tomorrow. I can't do that. No, no. You see, Sunday is the day that the general public will be admitted... but Saturday, it's by special invitation only. I know that. That's why I need help getting in. But I have nothing to do with the guest list. I'm the refreshments director. The guest list won't work anyway. They screened that weeks ago, okay? We've tried to crack it. We can't. Wait a second. You said you were refreshments director? - Mm-hm. - Does that mean you hire the help? Well, yeah. I guess so, but not really. - You guess so, but not really? - Mm-hm. Would you mind translating that for me? The waiters and the bartenders are people that Unified Charity's used every year. Year after year, you know, they always use the same people. All except for Mr. Sunderson. Uh, he retired a couple of months ago. Good, good. I'll replace Mr. Sunderson. I've already replaced him. Well, you can replace him again. I'll pay the guy whatever he was going to get. Plus a bonus, out of my own pocket. But, Amanda, I have to get in there. National security. Yeah. Look, three of the most dangerous and powerful men in this country... are meeting with Perrine there tomorrow and Perrine's the worst of the lot. - What? - We have to find out what they're up to... and we can't from the outside, looking in. Dangerous men are gonna be at our fundraiser? Yeah. Billy and I and a half a dozen agents have been parked by the stable... waiting for a break, which we got when we saw you walk inside. You're our only hope, Amanda. I'm your only hope. - This whole operation depends on you. - Whole operation depends on me. I guess I ought to mention this... This could get dangerous. Well, if they should find out who I am, which they won't... and if they should find out that you got me in there, which they won't... Things could get awfully difficult. Which they won't. [WHIMPERS] Does that mean you'll do it? Yes, I'll do it. [CHUCKLES] [UPBEAT BAND MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Carling London. Please, tell Mr. Perrine I've arrived. Oh, yes, Mr. London. Paddock area, first turn on your left, sir. ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: Welcome to The Unified Charities Exhibit... here at Jerry Perrine's Equidome. There's lots to see and we welcome you all today. - There is a short film about the restorations. AMANDA: Lee. It's very important that the glasses are clean and that we don't run short. If you find that we're running low, tell me... and I'll have some brought down from the restaurant, all right? Um, I ordered about 400 pounds of ice. I thought that would be enough. But if you find that you're running low... Lee? ANNOUNCER: there are bars and refreshments available... not only in the center of the Equidome, but also on the mezzanine level. Is it one of the men you were expecting? No. It's someone I didn't expect. Carling London. If London's involved, it's even bigger than we thought. Much bigger. Oh. [DOG BARKING] You are a little late in setting up the bar, aren't you? - Hello, Mrs. Coleman. - Yes, I was beginning to worry. Do we have enough ice for all the bars, Amanda? Four hundred pounds, Mrs. Coleman. Yes. Well, that should do it. I keep remembering, uh, last summer, the concert. Warm martinis. Not that it was your fault, Amanda. Really, I should have handled it myself... instead of entertaining the prominent sponsors. Oh, I see that you have found a replacement for Mr. Sunderson. I'm sure you'll do very well, Carlos. [LEE CHUCKLES] Yes, ma'am. - Uh, would you like a drink? - Oh, no. No, no. Not while I'm working. I don't see any cocktail napkins, Amanda. Oh, we were just going to put them out, Mrs. Coleman. One doesn't leave this sort of thing to the last moment. Uh... What? Did you check under there for black olives? - I don't have the mark off my list yet. - They're here. - You sure? - Yes, and so am I. Oh, damn it. Oh, this is not gonna work, Amanda. I cannot stand here and pour drinks all day... and wait for them to wander over here and drop everything in my lap. Can I? I know. It is awkward, isn't it? [CHUCKLES] You have a real talent for understatement. Lee, I understand who Perrine is, but who are all these other men? The money men you hear about. You know, commodities brokers, investment bankers. And you think that they're meeting here because it's closed to the public? Yeah. Look, this is the first time they can get together without surveillance... from a dozen different government agencies. World-class swindlers. [MAN CLEARS THROAT] Yes, sir. What can I do for you? A Bahamian dream, if you know how to make it. - How do you want it? - Just short of lethal. Ah. Well, you wait for this one. You won't remember the last one. One Bahamian dream. ANNOUNCER: A reminder: While on the floor of the Equidome today... please, don't smoke. [MAN CHUCKLES] Guess I should have expected you here, Carling. Well, you might have. It doesn't require too much imagination. MASTERSON: Great car. Perrine thinks so. Well, I've seen better. You interested in going in partners today? Now, why on earth would I do that? Because I'm close with Perrine. Might give you an edge. You're not close with Perrine. I don't even know why he asked you here. Same reason he invited you. He wants the coin. All of your coin, as you put it, is tied up in Bulgarian credits. - Where do you get your information? - From the Bulgarians. But we have a different relationship. They pay me. You're almost broke, Masterson. Perrine knows it. So do I. Only he wouldn't say anything. He's always been more charitable than I. All right. I've got a few problems. But it could hurt a lot if you say anything and you know that. Yes. I know that very well. Then you won't? By the end of this afternoon, everybody here is going to know. You really think I would allow you to talk one of the others into a partnership? That would be very bad business, now, wouldn't it? ANNOUNCER: Prices and starting prices are available in the brochures... which are available to you at the entrance to the hall. Ladies and gentlemen, the cars are very beautiful... but we ask you not to touch them. They are indeed very delicate and very old. - Look all you want, but... AMANDA: Excuse me a moment. - Uh, Lee, where are you going? - Gonna do some eavesdropping. - What about the bar? - I'll be right back. A grasshopper, please. I'm not the... - Grasshoppers. - Yes. Sure. TAGGART: Jerry. What's for sale? You'll find out at 2:00. With everyone else. Oh, come on, Jerry. We go back a long time. I'm not asking for an edge. [PERRINE CHUCKLES] PERRINE: Of course you are. TAGGART: All right, I am. Is it commodities? PERRINE: I'll tell you this much. It's a formula that's gonna change the futures market for all time. Are you serious? Am I ever not serious when we're talking about money? I suppose you wouldn't care to give me a preview of this formula. For old times' sake. Nice try, Taggart. Two o'clock. - Well, if you happen to have it on you... - I don't. The formula is in a nice, safe place... and it's gonna stay there until a deal's made. You there. - Yes, sir? - What are you doing? Uh, I'm trying to deliver these two, uh, bourbon and water, tall... but I can't seem to find the people who ordered them. Probably looking for them at the bar. Yes, but I said that I would deliver them. Go back to the bar, Carlos. Uh, yes, sir. I will. Thank you. Guard. Yes, Mr. Perrine. I don't remember seeing that man before. Check him out. If security's been breached, I wanna know about it. Now. Yes, sir. Delicious and cold martini. And don't forget your cherry. There you are. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. - Amanda. - Yes? - What is this? - I don't know. No one would drink it. Did you find out anything? Yeah. Perrine's got a formula up for sale. What kind of a formula? I'll know that at 2:00. That's when it goes up on the sales block. He didn't have it on him. Where do you suppose he stashed it? - I don't know. He has offices here. - Too obvious. Um, well, it's a big place. Kitchens, restaurant, stables. No, Billy's staked out by the stables across the street. Perrine hasn't left the complex. So? - In his car. - What? He has a red Excalibur that he's going to enter in the competition. - I don't think it's left the paddock yet. - His car is the place anyone would look. - Perfect hiding place. - No. - It doesn't make sense. - Of course it makes sense. The first place that anyone will look is the last place that anyone will ever look. I will wait till 2:00, okay? - I can do it. - You're not gonna do it. - Mai tai, please. - Uh, a mai tai. Yes, ma'am. I... Uh, a mai tai, that is. Yes. ANNOUNCER: I'll call your attention to it. It's tan. It's in Space 32. Look, if we can get Taggart in on this... we can give Perrine a block bid for the formula... on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. It's not exactly the kind of thing you can shop around. - And London? - He talks like he already owns it. Don't worry about London. When he finds out we put in a package bid, he'll back off. He may even walk away from this deal. You think so? Bet on it. ANNOUNCER: For obvious reasons, please do not light up while in the building. Thank you. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, we're very happy to have you here today. Later this afternoon, there will be a draw... Lee, you are not listening to me. There is a dead body. I was listening, but there's nothing I can do about it right now, Amanda. Could we at least move the car out of the sun? - And alert the killer? - Killer? Right, there's gotta be a killer. If there's a murder, there has to be a killer around somewhere. Perrine mentioned the meeting was at 2:00 and I think that is it. I've gotta get there, find out what it's about. Now, everything is here. This book will tell you how to mix anything. When in doubt, just make it stronger. - Where are you going? - Perrine's office. Just cover me. "Cliffhanger." Oh. Oh, I so hope you're having a lovely time. AMANDA: There you are. - My dear Amanda. - Hi, Mrs. Coleman. I simply had to tell you what wonderful reports I'm getting about Carlos. Carlos? Oh, yes. He's very good, isn't he? Uh... Oh, uh, Mrs. Coleman, he had to excuse himself for a moment. Oh, what a shame. I was looking forward to something cool and thirst-quenching. Well, maybe, um, I could make something for you. What do you suggest? Oh, I don't know. How about, um...? How about a Bohemian fling? Sounds wonderful. Mix this right up. It's one of my favorites too. Help yourselves, gentlemen. You know how to do that. I guess London can't make it. I guess not. PERRINE: Mm. Just wonderful. Makes life bearable. I've always said: "Just give me the luxuries and you can keep the necessities." [ALL CHUCKLE] AMANDA: Well, there you are. - You have your little secrets, Amanda. - Secrets? Like where did a lady like you learn to make such a delightful drink? Oh, well, it's very easy, actually. You know, you just follow the recipe. Recipe book, you see? I'd like to try one of those. - You don't want another martini? - No, no. No. No. Another Bohemian fling coming right up. Yes, sir. This is really my specialty now. PERRINE: You've got over 30 components in this candy bar. Now, you can substitute any of those components and still have a candy bar. All except one: the chocolate. Without chocolate, you don't have a candy bar. Without chocolate, you don't have a lot of things. - The cocoa bean? PERRINE: Exactly. The cocoa bean grows along the equator. Mostly in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. I'm selling a way to peek into the future... to make a killing on the cocoa market. And any other agricultural market you choose. [DOG GROWLING AND BARKING] Shh. There you are. Excuse me. This was supposed to be a mai tai. Yes, well, that... Well, that doesn't look like anything very much, does it? I'll correct that right away. PERRINE: This candy bar's got lots of almonds. The world's biggest exporter of almonds is California. You buy up almond futures, you use my formula... Shh. And the crop harvests out way under the forecast. - With all those cheap futures. LEE: Get out of here. Well, how does it work, Jerry? A catalyst that neutralizes the nitrogen in the soil, controls growth... - then leaches out in a year. - Get out of here. Ow! How many copies of this formula are there? Just one. Let go. I'm under too much scrutiny to use it. And I don't want evidence that I ever had it in my possession. Hope you're not carrying this formula around in your pocket. [PERRINE CHUCKLES] No, not likely. The floor on the bidding's 50 million and it closes after the judging. [CHUCKLES] Hi. Um, excuse me for just a minute, Mrs. Coleman. - That's all right, dear. - Yes, ma'am. [HORSE NEIGHS] Sir. Mr. Melrose, sir. Sir. Oh, sir. - Shh. - Sorry. You didn't have to call me, Amanda. I was looking for you. [HORSE WHINNYING] Yes, sir, I know. But, you know, on the complicated, uh, operations... sometimes, well, I get a little confused, sir. Sorry. Sir, it's, uh... It's Lee. He went to a meeting at Mr. Perrine's office. And, uh, well, he's been gone an awfully long time. And I'm just afraid that even though I'm covering the bar... sooner or later, someone is gonna notice... that the real bartender has been gone for a long time. It could be a long meeting. Scarecrow might be on to something. Yes, sir. Or someone might be on to him. Sir, I don't think you have all the facts. You see, Carling London is in the trunk of Mr. Perrine's car. He's dead, sir. - Dead? - Yes, sir. He's dead. I think someone should do something. Don't you? Yes, but, uh, we could blow everything if we move too soon. Sir, if there's been a killing, that means there's a killer out there somewhere... and Lee is out there, so... Well, you see what I mean, sir. Well, let's give him some more time. Cover the bar so that his absence won't look too obvious. Of course. Uh, yes, sir. You do understand what I'm saying, don't you, Mr. Melrose? I understand you nearly all the time, Amanda. It bothers me a little, but I do understand. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. [SIGHS] MAN [OVER RADIO]: Weatherby. Weatherby, are you there? Come in. Weatherby here. - You got things buttoned up in there? - You betcha. We got Mr. Carlos Perez on ice... - you might say. - Well, good. Keep him there. GUARD: Roger. AMANDA: Ooh. Come out. Come on. - That's the way. - Oh, thank God you came. Let's get this closed. [LEE GROANING] And don't try to talk. This is the standard treatment for hypothermia. I'm so brittle, I feel like something could break off. [AMANDA CHUCKLES] That's a good sign. You still have your sense of humor. Give me your hand. - Amanda. - Yes. Amanda, don't worry about me. Get his gun. - Get his gun? - Yeah, grab the gun. Put your little hand back in. - Here's the gun. - No. Never mind. All right, now get him undressed. - Get him undressed? - Yes. I wanna slip into something a little less conspicuous. Okay. I'll do everything except the pants. Suit yourself. - Did they have the meeting? - Yeah. Perrine's got a catalyst that controls plant growth by retarding the nutrients. - Yeah? - Yeah. What does that mean? It means whoever buys the formula can use it to make a killing... - in the commodities market. - I still don't know what that means. See, they take a heavily traded crop like, uh, cocoa or coffee... and they buy cheap futures and cut the harvest in half with the formula. Yeah? Some one-crop countries like, uh, Ghana would never recover... from a serious crop failure. Some would be wall-to-wall famine. Do they know that you know? All they know is I didn't belong on that balcony. And I'd be frozen stiff by now if it wasn't for you. Oh, well, you know, I just... - If you don't mind? - Oh, no. I'm sorry. You know, I'll just step outside. Yeah. Yeah. - Right out here. - Yeah. My hands, my hands. Lee, they've seen you. You can't just walk around here like you're invisible. I am invisible in this getup. Just another guard. Now, get back to the bar while I circulate. No, I... - Now. - All right. Okay. George? - Have you seen Mr. London? - No, sir. He's usually near his car at the judging. Thank you. Could still use a little work on the chrome, George. GEORGE: Yes, sir. George, uh, the car's not ready. I'm pulling it from the competition. - I don't want anybody near it. Understand? - Yes, sir. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder. There will be a drawing today at 3:00. Oh, no Carlos yet. Oh, well, it's not your fault, dear. Dependable help has always been a pain. You just do the best you can and start with the Bohemian thing. Yes, Mrs. Coleman. Sure, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder. There will be a drawing today at 3:00. We hope you're enjoying yourself. And a reminder, the 15 th of next month, another show here at the Equidome... and we invite you all. A reminder once again, there is no smoking while... Come on, Jerry. I wanna show you the Bugatti. - I've seen it. - Oh, okay. Catch you later. AMANDA: Oh, sir. Excuse me, sir. That's my clipboard. Sir. Sir, excuse me. Sir, that's my clipboard. - Sir. LEE: Amanda. Excuse me. Let me through, please. Amanda. That's my car. [TIRES SQUEAL] BILLY: All units, let's take him now. - Why did you get in the car? - He took my clipboard. Oh, Amanda. I lose that clipboard, I'm in a lot of trouble. That guy is in a lot of trouble. Believe me, he is in a lot of trouble when I get ahold of him. [HORN HONKS] Watch out. - That is my car. - The poor thing. Of all the cars in the lot, why did he have to pick my car? I know exactly how you feel. [HORN HONKS] That guy gets one dent in that car and he'll... I'll dent him. Now, this is for the car. Oh! [LEE SIGHS] AMANDA: Uh... Well, you were due for a new one anyway. Do we get our conspiracy charge? Yeah. Yeah, your hard evidence is right here. Your murderer is over there and London's body's in the trunk. He's been there all along, sir. Well... maybe you can save some parts. History. I'm sorry. I know how much you loved your car. Oh, Amanda, you don't love a car. But you sure do get attached to one. I bet when everybody adds up their receipts, this is gonna be the best fundraiser ever. Well, I'm not surprised. I mean, the public loves a good scandal. Oh, can you imagine arresting a man like Jerry Perrine? I can't believe it. Federal agents swarming all over the place. Oh, Amanda, it must have been so exciting. Ha! Mrs. Coleman must have been beside herself. Oh, yes, Mother. Mrs. Coleman was definitely beside herself. Well, tell me all about it. Well, there's not really that much I can tell you. Amanda, you're not much for details, are you? I am going to go upstairs and watch it all on the 11:00 news. Wish you could tell me more. - Me too, Mother. Good night. - Good night. I picked it up today. Oh, it pulls the road right up and corners like a track racer. - You got a new car. - Yeah, yeah. And it's great. Ha, ha. Anyway, I was out testing it out and I sort of, uh, wound up over here. And, uh... Well, I mean, you were there when I lost the other one and I thought maybe, uh... Oh, well, you know, I'm really glad that you came over and told me about it... and maybe sometime I'll get to take a ride in it. Yeah, yeah. Count on it. I mean, we will be, uh, working on another assignment. Right. I'll count on it. [ENGLISH - US -SDH] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
