AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN INEXPENSIVE, UNUSUAL WAY TO DELIGHT SOMEONE ON A SPECIAL OCCASION, THEN MARILYN'S MADE IN HEAVEN GIFT-O-GRAMS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. - GIFT-O-GRAMS... I'M ON MY WAY, Mrs. MAID! I HAD FOUND A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM, EVEN IF I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A GIFT-O-GRAM WAS. - YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A GIFT-O-GRAM IS? WHY! A GIFT-O-GRAM CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT IT TO BE. NOW WHAT'S THE OCCASION? - IT'S Mr. BROWN'S BIRTHDAY, AND I'VE RUN OUT OF IDEAS. - AH! THEN YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. I TAKE IT Mr. BROWN IS SOMEONE SPECIAL? - VERY, Mrs. MAID. - NOW LET'S SEE.

WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY GOT THE WORKS HERE. AND HOW WILL YOU BE PAYING FOR THESE GIFT-O-GRAMS? -WITH THIS. Mrs. MAID SAID I ONLY HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO SING ONE WORD, AND I DIDN'T THINK "BIRTHDAY" WOULD MAKE Mr. BROWN FEEL VERY HAPPY. I WAS GETTING DESPERATE. I NEEDED TO FIND A WAY TO PAY FOR THE GIFT-O-GRAMS. "URGENT. MODEL NEEDED. TOP RATES PAID." -SUPERB! SUCH FORCE! YOU HAVE CAPTURED THE VERY ESSENCE OF A BLUE BANANA. AH! WELCOME TO MY CLASS. HAVE YOU COME TO ENROLL? -NO, THANK YOU, I'VE JUST HAD A MARMALADE SANDWICH. BUT I DID SEE YOUR SIGN. -BETWEEN YOU AND ME, WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF PAINTING FRUIT. AND EVERY TIME I TURN MY BACK, SOMEONE'S EATEN IT. STUDENTS, PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR A CHALLENGE! ANYONE WHO CAN CAPTURE THOSE WHISKERS IN OIL WILL HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT. - CAPTURE MY WHISKERS IN OIL?! BUT THEY'RE NOT EVEN LOOSE. -WE SHALL NEED OUR BURNT UMBER, WITH PERHAPS A TOUCH OF ORANGE MADDER HERE AND THERE. - ORANGE MADDER? THAT'S Mrs. BIRD'S BEST MARMALADE. - ENOUGH DILLY-DALLYING. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO START MODELING. -I'M VERY GOOD AT MODELING. I'VE OFTEN HELPED JONATHAN WITH HIS AEROPLANE MODELS. - THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. I WANT YOU TO POSE. -YES, OF COURSE. HOW... - THAT'S IT! THE THINKER! MARVELOUS! - BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANYTHING. -THEN HOW ABOUT SOMETHING FAMOUS LIKE THE VENUS DE MILO IN THE LOUVRE MUSEUM? EXCEPT, OF COURSE, HER ARMS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OFF. -HOW UNFORTUNATE. THEN THE MUSEUM SHOULD BUY A NEW ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE ANYONE NOTICES. - ENOUGH! JUST STAND PERFECTLY STILL. DO NOT MOVE! -I SOON REALIZED THAT STANDING PERFECTLY STILL WAS EASIER SAID THAN DONE. -DRAT! AND I JUST HAD HIS FOLDS PERFECT. -MY FOLDS? STANDING STILL REALLY BUILDS UP A BEAR'S APPETITE. -AH! -I HAD TO POSE ALL AFTERNOON. AND THEN A FLY BECAME INTERESTED IN SOME MARMALADE ON MY WHISKERS. -Mr. MARSH! HOW CAN I PAINT A MASTERPIECE WHEN YOUR MODEL KEEPS MOVING? [HE SNEEZES.] -OH! - AH! - STOP! THIS IS A DISASTER! YOU'RE WASTING OUR TIME! HERE IS YOUR SALARY. - BUT YOUR SIGN SAID YOU PAY TOP RATES. -FOR PROFESSIONAL MODELS. - THINGS HAD NOT WORKED OUT AT ALL, AND NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE. EXCEPT FOR Mr. GRUBER. - THIS HOT COCOA SHOULD CHEER YOU UP A BIT. - BUT THE PERSON I WANT TO CHEER UP IS Mr. BROWN. I DON'T SUPPOSE HE'S EVER HAD A GIFT-O-GRAM BEFORE, BUT I CAN'T AFFORD IT. OH! I JUST NEVER SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH POCKET MONEY. - Mr. BROWN, I HAVE AN IDEA. [DOORBELL] [HE SINGS OUT OF TUNE]: ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY ♪ WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY ♪ WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY ♪♪ - BRAVO! - GOOD OLD PADDINGTON! - WHAT A SURPRISE! A SINGING TELEGRAM. HOW ORIGINAL! - I COULD DO AN ENCORE IF YOU LIKE. - NO! I... I MEAN... THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY, PADDINGTON... UH, THANK YOU. WHAT AN UNUSUAL BIRTHDAY PRESENT. - I HAD DONE IT, AUNT LUCY! ALL BY MYSELF. AND THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS MY TURN FOR A SURPRISE. - GOODNIGHT, PADDINGTON. - GOODNIGHT, PADDINGTON. - GOODNIGHT. AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY AGAIN, Mr. BROWN. -THANK YOU, PADDINGTON. OH, AND BY THE WAY, I'VE BEEN THINKING. THE PRICE OF BUNS IS GOING UP ALL THE TIME SO... I'VE DECIDED TO RAISE YOUR WEEKLY POCKET MONEY. -YOU HAVE? OH... [YAWNING] THANK YOU SO MUCH, Mr. BROWN. THAT'S... THAT'S... I... [SNORING] -HENRY, YOU'RE RIGHT! AS LONG AS PADDINGTON'S BEEN LIVING WITH US, WE'VE NEVER GIVEN HIM A RAISE IN HIS POCKET MONEY. WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF IT? - A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME. [HOOTING] WELL, MAYBE NOT SO LITTLE. THAT WISE OLD OWL Mr. GRUBER GAVE ME A CALL. -I WAS HELPING Mr. GRUBER TYPE UP THE LATEST CHAPTER OF HIS BOOK, THE WORLD AND ITS WONDERS, THOUGH IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT WITH PAWS. [SNIFFLING] WHERE'S THE "W" AGAIN, Mr. GRUBER? - RIGHT NEXT TO THE "Q"... "Q"... ATCHOO! -THANK YOU, Mr. GRUBER. Mr. GRUBER AND I WERE JUST BACK FROM CANADA AND THE WINTER CARNIVAL IN QUEBEC CITY. IN FEBRUARY, THERE ARE CARNIVALS ALL OVER THE WORLD: VENISE, RIO DE JANEIRO, NEW ORLEANS. AND IF QUEBEC'S CARNIVAL ISN'T THE OLDEST, IT MUST BE ONE OF THE COLDEST. - ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE WARM ENOUGH, Mr. BROWN? - WELL, YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO AN ICE PALACE. - YES. LET ME JUST CHECK THIS MAP AND... -OH! IT'S BEAUTIFUL! -QUI ETES-VOUS? -AH! OH! -JE SUIS BONHOMME. I'M AMBASSADOR OF THE WINTER CARNIVAL. AND THIS PALACE IS MY HOME! - I'M SORRY I DIDN'T KNOCK BEFORE I CAME IN.

IT IS TIME TO OFFICIALLY OPEN THE CARNAVAL! BIENVENUE, TOUT LE MONDE! MY FRIEND PADDINGTON AND I DECLARE THE QUEBEC WINTER CARNIVAL OPEN! [LOUD CHEERS] - WHY, Mr. BROWN, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - TO Mr. BONHOMME'S HOUSE. - THIS WILL BE WONDERFUL FOR THE WORLD AND ITS WONDERS! WHAT WERE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF THE ICE PALACE, Mr. BROWN? -VERY ICY... AND VERY HARD. -SPEAKING OF WHICH, PADDINGTON, YOU MUST ENTER THE ICE SCULPTURE CONTEST. WELL, I'M OFF. I HAVE A PARADE TO LEAD. -HUM... -MAKING A SCULPTURE OUT OF ICE WAS A LOT HARDER THAN I'D THOUGHT. AND WELL, I'M AFRAID Mr. GRUBER WASN'T THE BEST MODEL. - I DON'T KNOW... HOW MUCH LONGER... I CAN KEEP THIS UP. -OH, Mr. GRUBER, I'M SO SORRY. -AH... - PADDINGTON, MAY I GIVE YOU A PETIT WORD OF ADVICE: SCULPT SOMETHING YOU KNOW AND LOVE. - CAREFUL. IT'S GETTING STICKIER BECAUSE OF THE COLD. - IT CAN'T BE TOO STICKY WHEN IT COMES TO MARMALADE, Mr. GRUBER. [MUMBLING] - HURRY, Mr. BROWN, THE JUDGES ARE COMING. - TROP PETIT. TOO SMALL. - TROP PETIT. TOO SMALL. -THERE, THERE, Mr. BROWN. I THINK YOUR SCULPTURE IS LOVELY. - SOMETHING IS MISSING. - SOMETHING'S MISSING. -SOMETHING WAS MISSING. -OH, MAIS REGARDEZ.

HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! - DESPERATE? I WONDER WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT. -THAT SYLVAIN! HE IS SO RUDE! JUST BECAUSE HIS TEAM HAS WON THE CANOE RACE FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS. - 10 YEARS! THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR ANYONE. DO YOU FEEL LIKE LENDING A PAW, Mr. BROWN? -WHY NOT, Mr. GRUBER? I SOON FOUND OUT WHY NOT. THA... THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING CANOEING? WHAT ABOUT ALL THE ICE? -THAT'S WHY WE NEED YOU AT THE FRONT OF THE CANOE: TO DIRECT US AROUND THE ICE FLOES. - AND THESE WET SUITS ARE IN CASE WE FALL IN THE WATER. - I THINK I WOULD SOONER HAVE A DRY SUIT AND STAY ON LAND. -SO, YOUNG BEAR, WANT TO MAKE THE RACE A LITTLE MORE... INTERESTING? - I THINK THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING ENOUGH, THANK YOU. -NO, NO. I MEAN, SHALL WE MAKE A LITTLE BET ON WHO WILL WIN THE RACE? -WHY, YES. I WILL MAKE A BET.

VLADIMIR HADN'T TOLD ME WHERE THE DESSERT WAS, AND I COULDN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE. AND I COULDN'T FIND THE RECIPE EITHER. AH, AH! I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHY Mrs. SMITH-CHOLMLEY WANTED TO SURPRISE HER GUESTS WITH THIS DISH, BUT IT WAS HER PARTY. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DESSERT IS SERVED. TADAM! [ALL]: AAH! -AH!
