 -HEAVY?! THAT ROCK'S NOT HEAVY. WHY, IF IT WASN'T FOR... FOR THIS SPLINTER IN MY THUMB, I COULD CARRY THREE OF THOSE AT A TIME! - PADDINGTON? YOUR COCOA IS READY! -I'LL BE BACK AFTER MY COCOA AND MARMALADE SANDWICH. I NEED TO BUILD UP MY STRENGTH, Mr. CURRY. -STRENGTH? HA! IT'S ALL THAT COCOA AND MARMALADE THAT'S GOT YOU OUT OF SHAPE. - IF SOMEONE LIKE Mr. CURRY COULD LIFT THREE ROCKS, MAYBE I WAS OUT OF SHAPE. -PADDINGTON! YOU'RE GOING TO SPILL THE COCOA. - IT'S ALL RIGHT, Mrs. BIRD. I COULD LIFT THREE COCOA TRAYS. -HEE! HEE! HEE! MY ARMS WERE A BIT STIFF FROM MOVING ALL THOSE ROCKS. [TV]: HE'S AS QUICK AS AN EEL, HEALTHY AS A HORSE, AND STRONG AS A BEAR! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME GRANT STALWART! HE CAN LIFT BAGS OF CEMENT! BEND IRON BARS! CRUSH WALNUTS WITH HIS BICEPS! - THE BROWNS DIDN'T HAVE CEMENT BAGS OR IRON BARS, BUT THEY DID HAVE WALNUTS... OOPS! - OH! PADDINGTON! WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING? - IS IT CRACKED, Mrs. BIRD? - NO. BUT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK YOU MAY WELL BE. -YOU CAN DO ALL THIS AND MORE... WITH MY WORLD FAMOUS GRANT STALWART BODY BUILDING SYSTEM! - 50 POUNDS' WORTH OF GRAMT STALWART EQUIPMENT, YOURS FOR ONLY 5 POUNDS! PLUS A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE IF YOU ARE NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED! - I COULD BE AS STRONG AS GRANT STALWART AND GET A GREAT BARGAIN! IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. - DON'T FORGET THE 5-POUND DOWN PAYMENT. THE BALANCE IS DUE TWO WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY. - I HAD 5 POUNDS SAVED IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. BUT GETTING IN SHAPE WAS MORE IMPORTANT. AND SURE ENOUGH, THE GRANT STALWART BODY BUILDING SYSTEM ARRIVED A WEEK LATER. THE ONLY TROUBLE WAS, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO FIX THE SPRINGS TO A CONVENIENT WALL, BUT NONE OF THE BROWNS' WALLS SEEMED VERY CONVENIENT. - IT SOUNDS LIKE PADDINGTON IS REARRANGING HIS FURNITURE. - HE'S BEEN BEHAVING RATHER ODDLY LATELY. JUST LAST WEEK, HE SENT A WALNUT ZOOMING ALL OVER THE KITCHEN. [CRASH] THAT BEAR JUST DOESN'T KNOW HIS OWN STRENGTH. - I DECIDED THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. THIS WAS MUCH BETTER. -BEAR! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY FE... YEE-OUCH! -OH. I'M SORRY, Mr. CURRY. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE POKING YOUR NOSE IN MY BUSINESS. THESE ARE MY GRANT STALWART EXERCISE SPRINGS. THEY'RE MEANT FOR 7-STONE WEAKLINGS. I EXPECT IF YOU HAD A GO, YOU COULD BECOME AN 8-STONE WEAKLING IN NO TIME AT ALL. IT... IT'S WORTH 50 POUNDS. AND THERE'S A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE. -MONEY BACK GUARANTEE, HEY? IN THAT CASE, IT NEEDS A PROPER TEST. I SUGGEST YOU USE MY ATTIC. AND DON'T YOU WORRY. WE'LL GET OUR MONEY BACK FOR THIS SHODDY MERCHANDISE. - OUR MONEY? - OF COURSE, I'LL HAVE TO DEDUCT THE COSTS OF OINTMENT FOR MY NOSE, DAMAGE TO MY FENCE, USE OF MY ATTIC AS A TESTING SITE... -Mr. CURRY HAS A WAY OF TWISTING WORDS AROUND TO MAKE THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THINGS SOUND PERFECTLY REASONABLE. I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW EASILY THE SCREWS WENT INTO THE WALL. BUT... EASY COME, EASY GO. AND NO MATTER WHERE I TRIED, THEY JUST WOULDN'T HOLD. I NEEDED TO SHED MORE LIGHT ON THE PROBLEM. AH, AH! THERE. THAT OUGHT TO... AH!! [FOOTSTEPS] -BEAR! HAVE YOU FINISHED INSTALLING THAT...? BEAR!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY WALL? - I... I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HANDY HAVING THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR EASY REFERENCE. -AH! WHO NEEDS INSTRUCTIONS? I'LL JUST WARM UP WITH SOME OF MY OLD ARMY EXERCISES... THEN EXPOSE THIS GRANT STALWART SYSTEM FOR THE JUNK IT IS. AAAH!!! SIGNATURE. PAW PRINT. THIS DOCUMENT HEREBY TRANSFERS OWNERSHIP OF THE GRANT STALWART EXERCISE SYSTEM TO ME, AND I'M HENCEFORTH ENTITLED TO ALL MONEYS OWING ON THE GUARANTEE. [DOORBELL] - GRANT STALWART! - NONE OTHER THAN! - HERE NOW. IS THAT GRANT STALWART? THAT BEAR DOESN'T OWN THE EXERCISE SPRINGS. I DO! IT'S ALL THERE IN BLACK AND WHITE. I, Mr. CURRY, AM DUE THE 50 POUND REFUND. -YOU ARE INDEED THE LUCKY OWNER. AND WHILE I AM VERY GENEROUS IN MY REFUND POLICY, THE EQUIPMENT MUST BE RETURNED IN ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION, NOT COVERED IN PAINT AND GLUE. AND THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME KIND OF FUR STUCK IN THE COILS. PLUS, THE 5 POUNDS IS JUST A DOWN PAYMENT. YOU, Mr. CURRY, OWE ME 45 POUNDS. -45 POUNDS? OH! -HELP! GET HIM OFF OF ME! PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T MIND GIVING MY BILL TO YOUR FRIEND ONCE HE COMES TO AND... HERE'S SOMETHING TO KEEP THIS LITTLE... INCIDENT QUIET. -10 POUNDS? -YES. - Mr. STALWART GAVE ME 10 POUNDS, WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO DONATE TO THE HOME FOR RETIRED BEARS. BUT BEST OF ALL, THE BROWNS ALL SAY I'M STRONGER BOTH INSIDE AND OUT THAN ALL THE WORLD'S CURRYS AND STALWARTS COMBINED. - OH, OH, PADDINGTON! MY DEAR STRONG BEAR! MI OURSO FUERTE! - I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO AMERICA TO HELP Mr. GRUBER WITH HIS BOOK, THE WORLD AND ITS WONDERS, WHEN Mr. CURRY TRICKED ME INTO FIXING THE FENCE BETWEEN OUR TWO GARDENS. - BEAR! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO FIX THIS LOOSE BOARD BEFORE PAINTING IT? AND YOU MISSED A SPOT. - BUT Mr. CURRY, THE LOOSE BOARD IS A HANDY WAY TO GO BETWEEN OUR TWO GARDENS. AND YOUR FENCE IS A TOUCH TOO HIGH. - THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GOOD HIGH FENCE TO KEEP THE PEACE. WHOA! - AND EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? -I HAD A FEELING Mrs. BIRD DIDN'T THINK THE FENCE WAS HIGH ENOUGH. -WASHINGTON D.C., CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! COME ALONG, Mr. BROWN. THERE'S A TOUR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AT 2 O'CLOCK. -435 MEMBERS ARE ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. -435 IN ONE HOUSE! DO THEY EACH HAVE A BEDROOM, OR DO SOME HAVE TO SHARE? - UH... IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF HOUSE, ACTUALLY. AND WE'RE IN FOR A SPECIAL TREAT TODAY. PROFESSOR PATRICK BERRINGTON, THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS EXPERT, WILL BE ADDRESSING THE HOUSE. - THIS HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE AN ADDRESS? - AFRAID IT'S A NO-SHOW ON PROFESSOR P.B. HIS FLIGHT HAS BEEN DELAYED FROM PERU VIA LONDON. -WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD... BUT WE CAN STILL WATCH CONGRESS IN ACTION. - EXCUSE ME... - WHO ARE YOU? IDENTIFY! - PA... BE... - YOU'RE P.B.? -UH... WELL YES, I AM P.B. - P.B. HAS LANDED. REPEAT: P.B. HAS LANDED. - FROM LONDON. BUT I STARTED OFF IN DARKEST PERU. - YEP. POSITIVE I.D. LONDON VIA PERU... JUST LIKE YOU SAID. SHORT. ECCENTRIC. WEARS HAT INDOORS. AND YOU WEREN'T KIDDING ABOUT THAT BEARD. HURRY! IT'S TIME TO GIVE YOUR SPEECH TO CONGRESS. - A SPEECH? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TALK ABOUT? -P.B. REQUESTS SPEECH TOPIC... RIGHT. "A THEMATIC APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WITH RESPECT TO BOUNDARIES, BORDERS, AND DISPUTED LAND CLAIMS." OR, "WHAT MAKES A GOOD NEIGHBOUR." - NOW NEIGHBOURS WAS SOMETHING I KNEW A BIT ABOUT. - SO PLEASE WELCOME PROFESSOR PATRICK BERRINGTON. [APPLAUSE] HERE, P.B. SOME CONGRESSIONAL RECORDS TO STAND ON. - THIS IS CERTAINLY A MUCH BIGGER HOUSE THAN THE ONE I'M USED TO. AND YOU'RE ALL ONE FAMILY? [LAUGHTER] -WHY, IT'S Mr. BROWN! -WHAT MAKES A GOOD NEIGHBOUR? WELL, Mr. CURRY AND Mrs. BIRD WOULD BOTH SAY YOU NEED A GOOD FENCE. AND IT ISN'T OFTEN THEY AGREE. Mrs. BIRD WOULD LIKE THEM A MILE HIGH, BUT I'D PREFER THEM LOWER SO YOU CAN TOUCH THE TOP WHEN ON TIPTOES. AND THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE AT LEAST ONE LOOSE BOARD... [WHISPERING] UH, SO THAT YOU CAN GET BACK THINGS THAT YOUR NEIGHBOUR TOOK WITHOUT ASKING YOUR PERMISSION. [CHEERS] - THAT IS NOT PROFESSOR PATRICK BERRINGTON. I WANT THAT IMPOSTOR IN MY OFFICE IMMEDIATELY. -YES SIR, Mr. PRESIDENT. -PROFESSOR! -OVER HERE, PROFESSOR. -PROFESSOR! PROFESSOR! EXCUSE ME, PROFESSOR. -CAN WE PRINT THAT? - WHEN YOU SAY TIPTOE, WOULD THAT BE YOUR TOES OR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN'S? -PLEASE COME WITH ME. THE PRESIDENT WISHES TO SEE YOU IN THE OVAL OFFICE. -Mr. BROWN! Mr. BROWN! - YOUR SPEECH ON INTERNATIONAL BORDERS WAS A BIG HIT WITH CONGRESS, UH... PADDINGTON, IS IT? - YES, SIR... UH, Mr. PRESIDENT. - ONE THING: WOULDN'T THAT LOOSE BOARD LEAD TO A FLOOD OF IMMIGRATION? -OH NO! YOU WON'T FLOOD THE GARDEN IF YOU REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE HOSE. - HA! HA! HA! YOUR METAPHORS CERTAINLY ARE BRILLIANT, BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD EXPLAIN... -WHAT'S A METAPHOR? -HA! HA! HA! YOU'RE BOTH BRILLIANT AND CRAFTY. - I ONCE FORGOT TO TURN OFF Mr. CURRY'S GARDEN HOSE. I WASN'T VERY POPULAR. - I ADMIRE SOMEONE WHO ADMITS TO HIS MISTAKES. - OH. I'VE HAD PLENTY OF PRACTICE. BEARS ARE GOOD AT MAKING MISTAKES. [KNOCKING] - Mr. BROWN! Mr. BROWN... OH! -Mr. GRUBER! -PLEASE, Mr. PRESIDENT. Mr. BROWN DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE THE PROFESSOR'S SPEECH. IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE. - YOU... YOU MEAN I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GIVE A SPEECH? -THAT'S ME AND THE PROFESSOR LAST YEAR IN HELSINKI. IT WOULD TAKE THE PROFESSOR AN HOUR TO TELL ME THAT THIS APPLE IS RED. THEN ANOTHER HOUR TO REMIND ME THAT THERE ARE ALSO GREEN ONES AND YELLOW ONES. THE PROFESSOR, GENTLEMEN, IS A WINDBAG. - OH. - BUT YOU, PADDINGTON, GET RIGHT TO THE POINT. GOOD FENCES MAKE FOR GOOD NEIGHBOURS. NOT TOO HIGH, NOT TOO LOW. A LOOSE BOARD IS ALWAYS HANDY. LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES. GREAT STUFF. @ WHY, YOU CUT THROUGH ALL THE NONSENSE LIKE A HOT KNIFE THROUGH... -MARMALADE? -I WAS ABOUT TO SAY BUTTER. BUT YES. MARMALADE'S BETTER THAN BUTTER. DO YOU MIND IF I USE THAT IN A SPEECH, PADDINGTON? XPxPxxhhMO6ws ç ç999yyyyyyyÑued -IT'S Mrs. BIRD'S BEST.w, Uo !! THERE ARE LOTS OF CHUNKS. - THAT'S IT! INSTEAD OF THE "MELTING POT", WHERE EVERYTHING IS THE SAME CONSISTENCY, WE HAVE THE "MARMALADE POT". SMOOTH BUT WITH A LOT OF CHUNKS MIXED IN. I OWE YOU ONE, PADDINGTON. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? ANY PROBLEM YOU NEED HELP WITH? - HMM... WELL, THERE IS ONE THING. WHEN THE PRESIDENT OFFERED HIS HELP, I THOUGHT OF Mrs. BIRD, Mr. CURRY AND THE FENCE. -I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT BEAR IS BACK TO FINISH THE WORK ON MY FENCE. -HALT! WHO GOES THERE? - WHA...? IT'S... ME... Mr. CURRY. - CURRY ACTIVITY REPORTED IN FENCE QUADRANT THREE. DO YOU READ ME? - AHEM! PLEASE BE SO KIND AS TO RETURN THE INTRUDER TO HIS SIDE OF THE FENCE. -BUT... BUT... BEAR!!! -AT... CHOO! AT... CHOO! OH. GOOD BORDING, BADDIGTON. - BADDIGTON? MY NAME'S PADDINGTON, Mr. BROWN. -I DOW IT IS, BADDIGTON. BUT I HAVE A TERRIBLE COLD, AND SO DOES Mrs. BROWN. - IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP? - WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE IS. SINCE Mrs. BIRD IS AWAY AND OUR WASHING MACHINE IS BROKEN, A LAUNDRY MAN IS COMING THIS MORNING. CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF IT? IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE. THE CLOTHES ARE IN THE KITCHEN. AND YOU'LL FIND THE MONEY ON THE TABLE. - WHAT I NEED IS SOMETHING WITH WHEELS. [DOORBELL] [DOORBELL] -I THOUGHT YOU SAID BADDIGTON WAS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE LAUNDRY? [DOORBELL] - HE WAS! -THE LAUNDRY MAN... I'M COMING! -NOBODY HOME. -HURRY, BADDIGTON! THE LAUNDRY MAN IS LEAVING! - DON'T WORRY, Mr. BROWN. I'LL CATCH HIM. -OH... -WAIT! - AH, Mr. BROWN. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE? -IT'S THE BROWNS' LAUNDRY. I WAS TRYING TO CATCH THE LAUNDRY VAN, BUT I'M AFRAID I'VE MISSED IT. - WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE CLOTHES TO THE LAUNDERETTE? - THE LAUNDERETTE! OF COURSE. UH... WHAT EXACTLY IS A LAUNDERETTE, Mr. GRUBER? - IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE, Mr. BROWN. THE LAUNDERETTE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU WASH YOUR OWN CLOTHES IN COIN-OPERATED MACHINES. - IT DOESN'T SOUND VERY SIMPLE, Mr. GRUBER. - NOW FIRST, YOU HAVE TO SORT YOUR CLOTHES INTO PILES ACCORDING TO THE COLOR. THEN YOU PUT THEM INTO A SEPARATE MACHINE FOR EACH PILE. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT COINS. AND WHEN THE MACHINE STOPS SPINNING... -OOH! -YOU SIMPLY TAKE OUT THE CLOTHES AND PUT THEM IN THE DRYER. - NOW ARE YOU QUITE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THE LAUNDRY? - OH YES. Mr. GRUBER EXPLAINED HOW TO DO EVERYTHING. HE SAID IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE REALLY. - HMM... AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD DO FIRST? - I HAVE TO SORT THE CLOTHES INTO PILES. - I GUESS YOU DO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'. -NOW LET'S SEE... 1, 2, 3... I'M GOING TO NEED 19 MACHINES. -OH! YOU ONLY NEED 3. ONE FOR THE WHITES, ONE FOR THE DARKS AND ONE FOR THE COLOURS. -OH. THAT IS SIMPLE! -NO, NO, NO! THOSE MACHINES ARE FOR WET CLOTHES. STOP! I MEANT THOSE ARE THE DRYERS! YOU HAVE TO WASH YOUR CLOTHES FIRST. - MAYBE DOING THE LAUNDRY WASN'T SO SIMPLE AFTER ALL. -I SAY, BEAR... WHAT A STROKE OF LUCK! -LUCK? -YES. RUNNING INTO YOU, I MEAN. I SEE YOU'RE DOING THE LAUNDRY. - YES? - WELL, YOU CAN DO MY SWEATERS AT THE SAME TIME. NO POINT US BOTH THROWING MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN, IS THERE? -WELL... - WONDERFUL! JUST DROP THEM OFF WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED, AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE PERFECTLY CLEAN. - Mr. CURRY IS ALWAYS TRYING TO GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. I BOUGHT A WHOLE BOX OF DETERGENT. Mr. CURRY DID SAY HE WANTED HIS SWEATERS "PERFECTLY CLEAN". OH NO! -OH DEAR! SO Mr. GRUBER SAID DOING THE LAUNDRY WAS SIMPLE? - OH DEAR... I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE AGAIN. -I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. SEEING AS HOW WE'RE NOT VERY BUSY, AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY YOUR 1st TIME HERE, WHY DON'T I GET YOU STARTED AGAIN? IT'S NOT EVERY DAY WE HAVE A BEAR'S WASHING TO DO. - THANK YOU. AND I HOPE IT'LL BE A LONG WHILE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO AGAIN. FINALLY, EVERYTHING WAS WORKING PERFECTLY... THEN THE WASHING DISAPPEARED. HELP! THE CLOTHES... THEY'RE GONE! -NO, THEY HAVEN'T. IT ONLY LOOKS AS IF THEY'VE DISAPPEARED BECAUSE THEY'RE SPINNIN' AROUND SO FAST. IT'S A SORT OF PHENOMENON. - I THINK I SHALL HAVE TO REMIND Mr. GRUBER ABOUT THE PHENOMENON. -CAREFUL THERE. THESE SWEATERS ARE WOOL, AREN'T THEY? -OH NO. THEY'RE Mr. CURRY'S. - WELL, I HOPE THIS Mr. CURRY'S TALL AND THIN, AND HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT DOING LAUNDRY THAN YOU DO. -SOMEHOW, I DOUBTED IT. - I KNEW COMING HOME EARLY WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING'S BEEN GOING ON HERE. - BADDIGTON'S BEEN DOING THE LAUNDRY. - AND I SAW THE LAUNDERETTE FULL OF SOAP BUBBLES. - BUT BADDIGTON WAS SUPPOSED TO CATCH UP WITH THE LAUNDRY MAN. - I HAVE A NASTY FEELING HE DIDN'T. -HELLO! -I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE THIS. I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER MYSELF. - I DO HOPE IT'S ALL RIGHT, Mrs. BIRD. I HAD A BIT OF A PHENOMENON IN THE LAUNDERETTE. - A PHENOMENON? I THINK YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN, DEAR. A PHENOMENON MEANS SOMETHING STRANGE. -THAT'S EXACTLY IT, Mrs. BROWN. -AH, BEAR! I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR WASHING MY SWEATERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID. THEY WERE ALWAYS RATHER BIG, BUT THEY FIT PERFECTLY NOW. - I'M SURE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE LONG AND THIN, Mr. CURRY. - PERHAPS THERE WAS A PHENOMENON AT THE LAUNDERETTE AFTER ALL. -UH... YES. WELL, THANKS JUST THE SAME. AND HERE. A TOFFEE FOR YOUR TROUBLES. -SPEAKING OF PHENOMENONS... IT'S NOT EVERY DAY Mr. CURRY REPAYS PEOPLE FOR THEIR HELP. -YOU'RE RIGHT, Mrs. BIRD. SO I THINK I SHALL MAKE THIS ONE LAST.
