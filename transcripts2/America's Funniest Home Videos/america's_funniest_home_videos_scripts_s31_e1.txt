"Toddler temptation treat taker" sent in by Kelly sass from auburn, Georgia. We have will, Joe, and Kelly! All right! Congratulations, guys! You just won $10,000. All right. Now, here's my question. Are you going to spend it all on chocolate for will... Or dog treats for Joe? How are you spending the money? I think will has earned this, for sure. Kelly, also, when you came back into the room and saw that the chocolate was gone, did you assume will ate it? I knew right away that it was bad dog Joe. Bad dog Joe. We gotta give it to bad dog Joe. All right, well, congratulations, guys. You got $10,000 and a shot at $100,000 all because of bad dog Joe. [ Laughter ] Thank you! You got it, guys. All right.
