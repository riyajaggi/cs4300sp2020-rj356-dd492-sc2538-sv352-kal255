 Awake (2012): Season 1, Episode 10 - Slack Water - full transcript 
 In three days, Michael and Hannah move to Oregon: they visit with Emma and her parents to offer to be supportive, but the parents articulate a different decision for Emma. Hannah isn't convinced this is what Emma wants. Meanwhile, Michael is closing out cases while the captain urges her underworld partner to be patient. In Michael's other reality, a double murder looks like a theft gone bad; then, they find evidence in a dumpster that sends them searching for other answers.

 Previously, on Awake. So you would move? If that's what she needs, I'll make it work. Living in Oregon, your mind will eventually have to let go of L.A. I will be... incredibly sad to see you go.

 I like him. Why haven't I met him before? Dad, I got her pregnant. You know how you said that you knew when it happened? When was that? Just before Mom died. Where are you going ? Movers are coming today. I know. - Emma? - Mr. Britten, hi. Are you... How... how did you know? It's... it's Rex's. Guys, can you give us five, please? What's going on?

 There's something we need to talk about. I don't understand. She's... she's pregnant? Yeah. And you're sure that Rex is the father? Yeah. Pretty sure. So, uh, who is she? Here name is Emm... No, I mean, not... not what's her name. I mean, who is she? She was Rex's girlfriend. Why wouldn't he have told me about her? You know, I drove him everywhere. I picked him up. I took him to practice. I-I chaperoned his dances. You know, he... he told me everything. Apparently not. So how do you even know? How did you find out? Dad, I got her pregnant. Well, uh... we sort of found each other. Wait, wait. Okay, so if she's already... she's five months pregnant, then... she's decided to keep this baby. I guess. What did she say about... about raising it? She didn't. And you didn't ask? Michael, this girl is carrying Rex's child. Before we go anywhere, we got to figure out how we're going to be involved, right? Mr. Dion Driggs. Four counts of marijuana possession with intent to distribute. Yeah, the neighbors say he wasn't violent, but... he did bring scumbags to the building. Yeah, looks like one of them jacked him. Okay, how do you see it? Well... suspect here, bursts through the door, shoots Mr. Driggs in the head, and then grabs the laptop... a game console, whatever. All right, so this guy's a drug dealer, right? And I'm looking around, and I don't see any drugs. Maybe that was it. Maybe they took the stash. Okay, so let's keep it going. He gets that, runs out the door, goes down the hallway, okay? He's trying to make the escape. He gets to the staircase. In there, he runs into... This is Mrs. Maya King. 83 years old. Never leaves the apartment except to buy groceries. Wrong place, wrong time. He's got a stolen stash in his hand. He's got a dead body behind him. Shoots her, runs out. Whole thing's over in less than five minutes. The landlord's waiting to show us her place. You ready? This is Mrs. King's apartment. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Of course. I'm afraid police intervention has become quite a thing in this building. Still, I was surprised that it was Mrs. King. She was a wonderful tenant. Moved in here with her husband over 50 years ago, long before I bought the building. Do you know of any family or next of kin that we can notify? Well, her husband passed away years ago. She had an only son. Was a soldier, died in Vietnam. Did she have any close friends or neighbors you can think of? Well, she outlived most of them. Any neighbor that was close to her age got out of here a long time ago. I-I told her it was unsafe. I got out of here years ago. I wanted her to get out of here, but she wouldn't listen. She had faith in the community. I'm sorry she was so wrong. I'll talk to patrol, see if there's anything on the street. Get somebody started looking at the gang database for known associates. I'm gonna get some guys from the pawn shop detail, check some things out for us. We might get lucky. Let's, uh... knock on all these doors here, see if anybody saw the shooter going in or out. Yeah. Poor Maya should've moved out. The landlord was right. Sometimes you got to know when it's time to move on. I understand. I get it. You don't want a good-bye party, then fine. No party. Thanks. I mean, I just... wanted to express my gratitude. Thank you for everything you taught me in the past six months. - If you want to deprive me of that... - I do. So be it. - Good. - I am, you know? Grateful. Heads up. Just got a call... Sampson Trujillo is back. - In Los Angeles? - Yep. I don't believe it. Nobody called me. - Hold up. Who's Trujillo? - Cocaine dealer, arms dealer, you name it. He was a big player in L.A. We can tie him to at least three open murders. Vega, I'm attaching you to the federal task force. You're going to take the lead for our office. Me? Yeah, I'm going to put you with DaSilva. Captain? Captain... I got a... I got a file this big on this guy. I've been working on it for years. I could write a book. You're going to be gone in three days. I need somebody who can close these cases. All right? All right, sit down. You got a lot to learn. Come on. It's one cigarette. You said that last time, but everyone could smell it on me. My distributors are getting anxious. I told you, Britten is going to be gone in three days. Three days? Are you sure? Yes. I just chipped in 300 bucks for the champagne. You know, I need to move the last Westfield shipment quickly, and I can't do anything until he's gone. You need to be patient. You know what the two worst things are for heroin? Let's assume that I don't. Oxygen and humidity. Our product's been in storage since Britten's accident. It's oxidizing. I've waited patiently because you told me you could handle this. So now I'm going to wait three more days, and if he's still a problem, I'm going to take care of him. So tell me how this works. I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, I'm awake with my son. And this has been happening since the accident? So you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream. It all feels completely real to me. You can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment? Well, I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream. That's exactly what the other shrink said. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Angela. This is my husband Joaquin. Pleasure. And, this, of course, is Emma. Mr. Britten. Hi, Emma. I'm Michael. - Hi, and this... - Hannah, hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. - Thank you. - Mrs. Britten. - Hi. I heard so much about you. I like your shirt. Are you a Vampire Weekend fan? Yeah, I guess so. You know, Rex was really into them. When he was 14 he practically forced Michael to take him to a concert. That's his shirt. We consider ourselves fairly progressive, but we definitely weren't prepared for this. Yeah, believe me, we're still trying to get our heads around it. Of course you are. One thing we realized is that... this doesn't have to limit the rest of Emma's life. She's gonna finish school with her classmates. Go to college. Yeah, have you thought about where you want to go? I've narrowed it down to a few schools on the east coast. Yeah, uh, Rex wanted to go back east. Actually, that's something that Michael and I wanted to talk to you about. Well, we would love to be as involved as, as you would let us. A-And just to be there for you and the baby. For anything, doctor's appointments, babysitting, whatever we can do. That's a really beautiful offer. Really, it is but... I'm afraid we've made other arrangements. Other arrangements? We've been working with an agency, and we found a couple... who we're sure will make great parents. We looked into this thoroughly. We weighed all our options, and what we've decided is that adoption would give Emma the most closure. And as we said, that's our top priority. We understand you're focused on this new child, but Emma's still our child, and we have to put her first. What if we adopt it? The-the baby. We... The truth is that Hannah and I had been talking about having another baby, anyway, so... No, I'm sorry. We've all agreed that a closed adoption is what's best. Emma felt that maintaining any connection to this baby would just be too hard for her. We're moving to Portland, and, you could have as much or as little involvement as you would want. Look, I realize how hard this is for you, and we're not insensitive to what you're going there, but at the end of the day, this is Emma's decision. And this is what she wants. It is. Did you see Emma's face? She looked pretty shaken up, but... it was an awkward situation for all of us. No, uh-uh, it was more than that. It was like... they were talking for Emma saying she wanted to put this baby up for adoption. Well, she agreed. She said she agreed... but it was like they were making the decision for her. You didn't pick up on that? Honestly... no. Maybe you can want something so much that... it's easy to project. I'm not projecting, Michael. I... I'm telling you... they're pushing her to do something she doesn't want. I know how much it means to you. Game machine. And, uh... All right, the laptop has the same serial number as the receipt we found in the apartment. We got to take this stuff in. It's evidence in a crime scene. That's 150 bucks down the toilet. I don't suppose you took the I.D. of the guy who sold it to you? Yeah. Sure. He was real big with, like, a... patchy beard and crazy bug eyes. Sounds delightful. Who do you think we got coming in here, the Kardashians? 2642 Hibbing Street. All right, we got an address. He was here for over a year. But he couldn't make rent, so they gave him the boot. He had trouble with drinking. Any idea where he might be now? I hear he's living on the streets. What streets? How you guys doing? You know someone called Perry? Perry Jenkins? Big tall bald guy? Perry! These guys are looking for you. Jenkins! Stop! Go! I'm going! Where are you? Stop! Stop! Where were you? Murder? What, are you kidding me? So why'd you run, Perry? Why do you think? Where'd you get it? Found a whole bag of weed in the Dumpster behind the Kwikmart. Come on, man, look, we know you brought Dion's items into the pawnshop. Dion? What, you mean the video games and stuff? I found all that in the trash, too. Where's this Kwikmart? It's down there by the Video Den. I'll take you. - It's on the way. - No. No. If nothing turns up in here, I'm gonna lock you away forever. You get that? This doesn't make any sense. Who would kill Driggs for his stuff and then turn around and throw it into a Dumpster? I don't know. But not that guy. Hi. Hi. It was so awkward the other night, I came to say I'm sorry. Here. A peace offering. I saw you drinking out of that plastic bottle, and I read somewhere it's bad for the baby, so... Glass. Thanks. Yeah. I also came because... I saw something that night, and... if I'm wrong, you can tell me to get out. I'm not really sure what you mean. You didn't seem as certain as your parents about giving up this baby, and I want to be sure that you're doing this for you, because you want to and not because they want you to. Look, you don't even know my parents. Well, I don't need to know them, Emma. This isn't about them. This is your decision. It's about you and... and this baby. Nobody else. Really? Because right now it seems like it's all about you. All about you not getting to raise this baby. You can tell yourself whatever you want, that you came here to... save me. You're just wasting your time. I've made my decision. I'm such an idiot. You did what you thought was right. No, I mean, she must think I'm, like, some kind of stalker. And you know the worst part? What? I really did think I was helping her, like I was stopping her from making some... decision that she was gonna regret. How'd I get it so wrong? Look, sometimes you want something so badly that it blinds you to everything else. I did, Michael. I-I wanted it that badly. I know, honey. Thank you. For what? I don't know, just... listening to me and... being there. You're stuck with me. I love you. I love you, too. Police seized nearly 20 kilos from the scene, making it one of the largest busts L.A. has seen in recent memory. Police Captain Tricia Harper commended SWAT and lead detective Efrem Vega on a job well done. I look good on TV. Don't you think, Mike? I don't really gauge the attractiveness of other men, you know? Okay, but you can appreciate a good cheekbone. People in the quiet neighborhood were surprised to learn that this house had been a home to one of the largest drug rings Los Angeles has seen this year. Mike, you're not supposed to be down here. I'm looking for the video games from the double murder in the apartment the other day. All right, just wait, okay? How do you find anything here? Nothing's in order. It's chaos. No, there is a system. Just don't touch anything. It just got back from processing. Thank you. Come on. That's it. Where's the disk? I don't know. Maybe some detective came down here and took it. Maybe it's in his machine. - You ready to go? - Yeah. How do I switch this on?... turn the TV to game mode. No, it's the... The button. It's... Can I...? Here. And then you, uh, press the center button and you toggle the left switch. We are... online. I have friends who... play them. Okay. So... now what? I'm not sure. Is that part of the game? Yeah, it's a message from another player. - Live? Now? - Yeah, yeah. - Can I talk to him? - Yeah. No, you, here, I just type here? He can see you. Just talk... Where's Dion? I'm Detective Britten. This is Detective Bird. Where with the Los Angeles Police Department. No. I knew it. I knew something bad had happened. Where are you? Stockholm. He's in Sweden. Yeah, I-I know where Stockholm is. Thanks. How do you know Dion? I've never met him, but we used to play together for years... until the other day. What happened then? I don't know. We were playing the Crime Spree, and he said he heard a gunshot. And then, he paused the game to go look, and he never came back. Is he okay? Maya was killed before Dion, not after. So Mrs. King is coming up the stairs with her groceries, and the shooter's here... ...and he takes her out before she has a chance to witness anything. Why? Maybe he had to kill her first before he could take out Dion. For what? For his stuff? He didn't want the guy's stuff. He put it in the Dumpster. Okay, so what was he looking for? Cover. That's why he shot him second. That's why he dumped the stuff. He didn't come for him. He came here to kill Maya King. Maya King... really is so sad. Maya was Miss Pearl's best friend. How did she take the news? Okay, in her own way. Hello, Pearl. We'd like to ask you a few questions about your friend Maya. Pearl? You think you can help us? I'd like to, but I don't know why I should help Myron. You are a lousy grandson. I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm not your grandson. You missed Christmas, you missed my birthday. Pearl, the reason that Myron here hasn't been to visit is because he's been helping the police with special investigations. What kind of investigations? Well, he helps us find killers, like the person who hurt Maya. Is that true, Myron? Myron? Yes, ma'am. I'm proud of you. So, can you help us? Can you tell us something about Maya? She liked cooking. She loved it. And she loved cats, and the music of Mr. Sammy Davis Jr. Okay, and was there anybody she didn't get along with? Everybody loved her. Even those rude boys out on the corner... they'd tip their hats and say, "Good Morning, Miss Maya." What about her friends? Anyone she was close to in the building? Well, at one time, we were all close. But little by little, people moved out, passed away or ended up here. Isn't this lovely? So, there's more than one person from the building here? Yes, of course.. And at one time, there was more than that, but you know, at my age, you get used to that sort of thing. It was dangerous there. It's so much safer here. Right. And did you all want to stay together? Why did you all end up here? Mr. Wilson. Curtis. He pays for everything. Your landlord pays for you to be here? Yes. He pays for all of us. It's too bad poor Maya didn't take that offer, too. So, he wanted Maya to move? Yes, but she didn't want to. Pearl, why do you think Mr. Wilson would pay for everybody to be here? I've known him for 30 years. He's a nice boy. Which is more than I can say for Myron over here. Turns out, when Curtis Wilson said he wanted out of the neighborhood, he's not kidding. He basically owns this whole block. He's been taking offers for a year. So, how much does a block in Westlake go for these days? North of ten million. Ten million?... Hell, I'd take you out for ten million. The problem is, Maya King, Pearl, the other senior residents... they were all there before he bought the place. They were on rent control. So, let me guess. He can't sell the building without their consent? Exactly. So he ships Pearl and the others to nursing homes, and then, when Maya won't go... Boom. Shoots her, shoots Dion to make it look like she got caught in the crossfire. And who's going to question a guy like Dion getting shot in that neighborhood? Happens every day. The thing is, his alibi checks out. I mean, I verified it myself. So, he's didn't do it himself. Look, he's not the kind of guy to get his hands dirty, anyway, is he? Okay, well, let's pull the phone and bank records. See if we can establish contact with the shooter. Sound just like a detective. Did a lot of good work at this desk. I don't know. Maybe we should have it bronzed. Can we? It's not in the budget. At least you have your memories, right? Yeah. I seem to remember a sensitivity seminar in Culver City with a very skinny narcotics detective with - a big red fro. - No. An out to here fro. You had to go there, didn't you? Who stuffed all the brownies from the buffet into her purse. I didn't take 'em all. You know what? I think I gave you one, right? Yes, you did. Yes, you did. You always had my back. You okay? I'm going to miss you. Back at you, boss. You got here early. Yeah, I got an e-mail a few hours ago with Curtis Wilson's records. I thought I'd get a jump on it. Nice. You find anything interesting? The bank records were useless, but the phone records turned up something interesting. He received a call from a throwaway phone just before and just after the murder. So, I went to the U.S. Marshals, got a subpoena. Turn out, they're the only two calls ever made from that phone, and they were both made from this building... the 1800 block of Figueroa. 30 units. Went through the residents, the records. Comes down to this guy. Milo Owens, 30 years old. Parolee, history of heroin use, uh, possession, dealing, armed robbery, bunch of really nasty stuff, and I'm saying, Mr. Owens here is due a call from L.A.'s finest. - Get down on the ground! - Police! - Show me your hands! - Get down! - Down! - On the floor! Down! Get down! Get on the floor! Milo Owens? Yeah. Just checking. All right, let's search the place. Mike? Under the mattress. Criminal mastermind, no? All right, Milo, we have everything we need on you. You know that. Essentially, we own you right now. You got that? I mean, we know you shot Dion and that nice old lady. And we're here to help save you the trouble of having to pretend you didn't do it. No, I didn't. I was at home. - I was in my apartment. - Shh, shh, shh. Milo. - No, I didn't. I... - Shh, shh. You're just hurting yourself. Just shut up. Lucky for you, what we really want is the guy that hired you. So, if you play ball with us, you're nice, you help us, we tell the D.A. you were cooperative, and then maybe, you spend your jail time cleaning up, watching TV, getting an education. Anything. But you don't help us out... The next needle will be your last. Who hired you to kill Mrs. King and Mr. Driggs? It was Curtis. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. He paid me five grand. - He told me nobody would find out. - Well, he was wrong. So now help us bring him in. You have any kind of proof that he made contact with you? Some, uh... something written maybe? - A text, an e-mail? - No. Got a voice mail? He just always wanted to meet in person. Okay, well, then, this is going to be a little bit more difficult... for you. Mr. Wilson, it's Milo. Why are you calling me? I'm sorry. I-I... I know you said not to, but, I've been thinking about it, and, uh, I want more money. It's not fair that... Stop. I'll meet you. At the park on Harvard. 3:00. Okay, c-could we, uh... He hung up. Okay. Let's get you wired. Just get him to say as much as you can. And as soon as you get him to admit that he paid you, that money exchanged hands, we've got him. Okay? Money exchanged. Okay. - Got it. - Yeah. All right? Yes. Okay, where's the... the mic again? Don't... don't touch it. It's right here. Look. Okay. See that? Yeah, yeah. It's gonna be find. - Okay? - Yes, yes. - All right. - Got it, got it. Should I, like, lean into him - so he... - No. No. - No. No. - Sorry. That's okay. It's understandable. Just be yourself, and be natural. The conversation is gonna go great. I got it. I just... I'm rattling man, you know? Damn it. He's crashing. Just, you know, if I... If I could just get a, uh, quick taste, I'd be a lot better. I could do this. Are you asking us for heroin? Yeah. In a police station? Let's see what we can do, okay? Okay. All right. Maybe we should call it off; he's falling apart. He's our best chance to get Wilson. Without him, we got nothing. Look, he's desperate. He's gonna come across as desperate, and that works in our favor. He knows what's at stake. He can do it. You think? I hope so. Why is he looking at us? He's not. He's just looking this way; it's fine. State your business and do it quickly. I want more money. How much money do you want? I, uh... Come on. 10,000, 20,000... doesn't matter. Just say anything. More. You said that already. It's not fair. I took all the risks. Your pupils are tiny. Are you high? - No! - That's why you want money. For more drugs. No, I want you to admit that you used me. What is this? Who are you looking at? Are you wearing a wire? What do you think, I'm some kind of narc or something?! I think you're a very troubled young man. Everyone stay where you are. We got nothing. You know what? You know what I think?! I think you're trying to pin this on me. Yeah, I think you want me to go down with this. Yeah, make me the fall guy, Have you lost your mind? I bet you're wearing a wire. - Come on. - Stop it. - Stop it! - No! Come on. You keep this up and we're both going to end up in jail. You should have thought about that before you hired me! I never would've hired you if I had known you were a complete and total junkie. Okay, we got him. Let's go. - No more! - I want more! Stop! Stop! Police! Give me your hands. I was accosted by that man. I didn't know you were the police. I thought you were with that junkie. Yeah, I'm sure. That's what I thought you were. I didn't realize you were the police. Emma. What you said the other day... I can't get it out of my head. You're right. I don't want to give up this baby. Sweetie, come here. So what did they say? At first, they really seemed like they understood, like they were actually listening that I wanted to do this. But as more time went on, they just were trying to change my mind. I told them to stop, and... that's when they freaked out. Lemon and honey. How'd you know? So you just walked out? They didn't give me any choice. They pulled the whole "not under our roof" thing. I had to get out of there. Before I knew it, I was here. All right, I think you should call them. Why? It's not like they tried to stop me. They don't know where you are, and I am sure they're worried about you. And they're probably trying to figure it out themselves. You know, they had certain expectations that they have to readjust. It's gonna take some time, Emma, but they love you and... they'll come around. I hope so. Because I don't know where we're gonna live, what we're gonna eat. I mean, I don't even know my insurance. It's gonna be okay. Yeah. We meant what we said. Whatever you need, we're here for you. Really? Really. Meanwhile, can I make you breakfast or...? Could I take a bath? Yeah. So I just talked to Emma's father. And? And he's angry. Very angry. At Emma? No, at us. For changing his daughter's mind. He says we are taking advantage of her, we're manipulating her. That's crazy. Coming from a guy who's trying to make her give up her baby, you know. He's not gonna, like, kick her out of the house? He's bringing a suitcase over. He's... they're trying to scare her. Yeah, well, it's working. Did I make a mistake? I mean, we've got somebody else's kid upstairs in our bathroom. You listen to me. You are the only person that realized what she really wanted. I missed it, her parents missed it. So don't beat yourself up over this. I don't know how this is gonna play out, but right now, she's exactly where she needs to be. What about us? Maybe we're where we're meant to be, too. I'm gonna call the movers, get our stuff back, and you got to call work. Are you sure? Yeah. We're supposed to be watching the game at O'Malley's tonight with a bunch of the guys. So I'll talk to the captain then. About tonight. Surprise! Hi. Thanks. Yeah. Give me a hug. Captain. - Congratulations. - Yeah. So, well, your partner sure throws a great party. Yeah, I wish he was half as good a detective. Okay, all right. Can I get a minute alone with the captain? Yeah, cool. I'll go check on Hannah. All right, thanks. What's up? I know this is gonna sound kind of crazy. I'm not leaving. What? Some personal stuff came up. Me and Hannah. And I'm gonna stay. Wait, I'm-I'm confused. Personal stuff...? Before he died, Rex got his girlfriend pregnant. And turns out, she's having the-the... Well, we're gonna be grandparents. That is amazing. I know. Right? I mean, it's weird. So you're not gonna be leaving anytimee soon? Not planning on it. I mean, we're taking it day by day, but... Hope that's okay with you. Of course. Think I better tell them. I saw Vega welling up when you said you were gonna stay. He was so drunk by the end, he would've cried if I told hi I liked his hair. You're up. Did you guys have fun? Yeah. How was your night in? First, I was bored out of my mind, but then this X Files marathon came on. Have you guys seen this show? Yeah, I-I taped them. It's messed up. You want a plate for your pizza? I'm good. Okay, don't stay up too late. I won't. I just want to watch one more. All right. Do you guys want to watch with me? Kind of freaks me out. Sure. This good? I know this one. Yeah?... It's good.
