 Awake (2012): Season 1, Episode 8 - Nightswimming - full transcript 
 At night, a naked man, runs beside a swimming pool and up the ladder of a diving platform while two armed cops tell him to stop. In Michael's life with Hannah, she's packing for their move to Oregon. He's hoping to pass a long-time informant to his partner. Jake, the informant, isn't happy about the arrangement. In the alternate reality, a Mob accountant is marked for murder, and Michael tries to convince him and his wife, who was unaware that her highly-paid husband was working for the Mob, to abandon life as they know it and enter witness protection. She is angry at her husband, and she bolts in rebellion. And the guy on the diving platform?

 My I.D.'s right here. I-I-I got to reach for it. Hold on. Go ahead. Slowly. I got him. What the hell is going on, detective britten? It's kind of hard to explain. So tell me how this works. I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, i open them, I'm awake with my son. And this has been happening since the accident? So you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream. It all feels completely real to me. You can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment? Well, I can assure you, detective britten, this is not a dream. That's exactly what the other shrink said. Sync & corrections by into-the-light www.Addic7ed.Com Tell him I have the Butler files and I'm on my way. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'm trying to get on the road now. Let me call you back as soon as I get there. Listen, this is really nothing to worry about. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, tell him I said that. Okay. Oh, come on. You have to be kidding. Oh... Marcus, you are one lucky man to be sitting here. Let me tell you something, my friend. You walk out that door, I have a feeling your luck would change very quickly. Testify, and we'll see that you're taken care of. Yeah, taken care of... Taken care of how? You know the drill. Witness Protection, relocation. A chance to walk away from this mess and start afresh. Look, I told you before, I'm just an accountant. You're an accountant for Maxim Basayev. Now, we both know the only reason he's not gone down for human trafficking, drugs, guns... you name it... is because he kills anyone he thinks might compromise his operation. Don't insult us both by pretending it's a surprise. We've been telling you for two months now that we would take down Basayev and his crew and that you could either help us or go down with them. Today, they threw you overboard. And as far as life preservers go, we're it. Where would I go? Well, the U.S. attorney will work with you to find a suitable place. You and your wife. My wife. Yeah. Look, look, she doesn't know anything. About what I did for Basayev. I understand, but I'm afraid that's not going to help. He would use her to get to you. She's still a target. We have to get her into protective custody as soon as possible. Where is she? She-she's out of town. Where? Laguna. Some spa. I... I don't know. I'll have to look it up in my phone. Okay. I'll get your phone, and I'll get a car pointed in that direction. It's going to be okay. You're doing the right thing. When I came here... When I first took this job, it was supposed to be for us. We had nothing. I wanted to be... A man who could give her anything. Well, I'm sure she would rather have a live husband than another giant flat-screen TV. Yeah. You don't know my wife. Marcus was strictly the accountant, but he knows where the bodies are buried. I mean, he laundered cash for him, covered money trails, and he kept records. Has he actually shown you these records? No, but he's going to hand them over as soon as we settle on a relocation package. We have been trying to nail Basayev for the last eight years. This is a big win for us. The wife's arrived. She's on the way up. What's going on? Are you okay? Hi. I'm fine. Yes, yes. I don't understand. They wouldn't tell me anything. They just said you were in some kind of danger. What's going on? Alina, I, uh... I, uh... Mrs. Ananyev, I'm detective britten. Why don't we all go and sit down somewhere more quiet? Hmm? Follow me. So you've been working for the... Bratva? Yes. For how long? Two... Two years. So you lied to me... For two years. Every day. Every time you kissed me good-bye. Every time you came home late. Every time I ask you, "how was your day?" It was all just lies. No. Alina, listen. How could you not tell me? What if I had? Would it have made any difference? It was blood money. Would knowing that have stopped you from spending it? Would you have given up all the clothes and the cars and the vacations, the gifts? You wanted those things as much as me. Alina, I wanted them because you... And now we have nothing because of your lies! You don't understand. So... We... we pack our home and we leave everything? You can take whatever you can fit into, uh... One large suitcase each. Where will they send us with one large suitcase each? Well, the prosecutors will work with you and Marcus, and, uh, they'll find somewhere that you both feel... What about my friends? I can never speak to them again? Any link to your current life or your identity makes it easier for them to trace you. I'm sorry. I can't. This is... Alina. Alina, please, come back here and sit down. They will find you, Mrs. Ananyev. They tried to kill your husband today. Put a bomb in his car. He's lucky to be alive. He's in a unique position to bring down a major crime syndicate. These people will not hesitate to do whatever it takes to you to stop him cooperating. You understand? They will find you. I know this must be overwhelming. I'm sorry, but if you value your life... ...you really have no option. Please, come sit down. Alina. So... what happens now? How long will we live here? Uh, just until the details for your relocation package are worked out. Shouldn't be more than a few days. Now, we got a team of officers in the adjoining room. We got some downstairs in the lobby. If you need anything at all, you speak to them, or you can call us, but under no circumstances can you leave the room. Is that clear? Yeah. My mother... she... ...gave me a painting before she died. There's, um, also a book of photos. We'll se a team to your house to collect some items. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Bella. Oh, my God. Bell... We have Bella right now. Uh, who's Bella? Our cat. She probably hasn't eaten all day. We have to get her right now. Calm down! I won't go without Bella! Alina, I want to help. I'll kill you! - Come here! Come here! - You've destroyed us! All right. All right. All right, let's calm down. Come on. Okay, I'm going to let you go. You stay calm? It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. How can you say that? You tell me I can never go back home. Everyone I know. Everything we have. I have to leave it all behind. How can you possibly tell me it's going to be okay? You can't even begin to imagine what that feels like. Hey. Hey. When did you start doing all this? Uh, about three days ago. Well, I thought we were going to do it together. Yeah, you said you wanted to do it last weekend, and the weekend before that, so... I just decided to do it myself. You giving away this dress? I love you in this dress. I haven't worn that dress in, like, 15 years. And even when I did, I looked like a hooker. China? What's the matter with the China? We're giving that away? We don't touch it. We haven't used it once in 18 years. Well, we're going to Oregon. Maybe in Oregon we'll... Be China kind of people. No? Ah. Look, deciding what to keep and what to give away... it's hard. We could come up with a reason to keep everything. So, I just figured, if we don't use it, we should lose it. Oh, come on. You're giving this away? Michael. And we have a tape player? I mean, I don't even know if it works anymore. Where is it? It's right there. I can't believe it. I made you this tape. Remember that summer? You were working in Chatsworth. Here we go. You hated that job... ...but you loved this song. You remember? Of course I remember. You recorded that song, like, over and over again so I can listen to it on the way to work without having to hit rewind. When's goodwill coming? Tomorrow morning. All right, let me call and put 'em off for a couple of days. Michael... What? Nothing. It... Look, this move to Oregon was my idea and I just know you have some reservations about it. I just want to look through everything and make sure you're not giving away things that I'd like to keep. Don't read anything more into it than that. Really? Yeah. You didn't tell him I was coming? He'll be fine. This guy Jake... He's been your C.I. for how long? For 15 years. 15 years? How do you know he'll be okay working with me? Because he's not a complicated guy. Trust me, I know. Look... You give him those. Cubans. He'll be your new best friend. Hey. You read with those things on? No, but I can't read with them off either. Doesn't matter. Who the hell is this? Uh, Jake, this is my partner. I'm detective Efrem Vega. I've heard a lot about you. The deal is I deal with you. Period. I know, but, I'm not gonna be around much longer. The arrangements always work for us pretty well, right? So, I thought the two of you might be able to keep it going. What does that mean... you're not gonna be around much longer? Are you leaving me? I'm not leaving you. I'm going with my wife. Going where? Oregon. Oregon? Who the hell lives in Oregon? That's what I keep asking him. The point is, if you want to keep drawing these get-out-of-jail-free cards, Vega's your guy, okay? Uh... I hear that you are a fan of these. Yeah, well, I-I quit. Quit? Come on. These are your favorite cigars. I got eyes. I can see what they are. The doctor told me it's giving me reflux. Oh. Sorry. Hey, what do you say we go someplace that's got real food, huh? I feel like a New York steak served to me by a woman that's half my age. Sorry the captain's got us on a short leash, but here. You can pay for your steak and mine. Generous tip. Be careful. So... You said something about a crew pulling a job? Yeah. San Pedro industrial park. When? Tonight. Tonight? Mm-hmm. 11:30. They're hitting a warehouse that's leased to, uh, palace electronics. Palace. Mm-hmm. And from what I understand, they got a six-man team with body armor. So you better bring your whole posse. That it? What do you want? A map? Thanks. Yeah. Have a good time in Oregon. See ya around. See ya. Better get a team together. 6 out of 19, uh, we're clear all the way down the block on our side. Over. 36, you got an overhead that's out right there. I don't got a visual on you. Maybe he got it wrong. The last time Jake got anything wrong you were repeating sixth grade. Have a little patience. I lost my patience an hour ago, which was two hours after Jake said this crew was supposed to show. Everyone, heads up. We got an unmarked truck headed towards the target location. What I tell you? Little patience. 7w43 copy. All units, hold your positions. Stand by for my orders. Okay, copy that. Confirm visual. Just got visual. Single driver. Please respond. That was exciting. Let's do a low-profile traffic stop in case he flagged us and kept going. Copy that. He's playing you. I've known him for 15 years, all right? Exactly. After 15 years, you hand him off with a c-note and a couple of cubans. I know it doesn't agree with you, but a little warm and fuzzy doesn't hurt. He's a C.I.... confidential informant. It's a business relationship. He knows better than anyone, bad tips are bad for business. Redrum. I guess you know everything about everything. So, I'm just going to sit back, hear it, and, you know, wait for more trucks not to appear. 7-11-43, trucks clear. No involvement. Copy. Let's get a good F.I. just in case and then kick 'em. Yes, sir. You got it. Yeah? Hello? Bird? How soon can you get over here? Why? What's going on? What is that? What you're listening to is Markus freaking out. He woke up this morning and Alina had left. What time? Well, the last confirmed time was, like, 2:00 A.M. Do we have any idea where she is? None. Nobody knows anything. Let's hope Basayev doesn't either. Just get over here, okay? If I would have gone, Alina would be safe. She wouldn't be in danger. The idea of her out there, alone... Marcus. Marcus. Unprotected... You need to focus, okay? You need to write down anyone who you could think of that she might be with right now. Relatives maybe. No, neither of us have family here. Okay, what about friends? Friends... Oh, come on, man! She must have friends! I was always working, okay? I don't really know her friends. I remember a few people she talked about. Okay. Mariana, Svetlana... I don't know. Only their first names. All right, what about places she used to go? When you were at work, where did she like to go? Where'd she hang out? I don't know. Spas, beauty salons, book clubs. I don't know. I don't know. Do you even know your wife at all, Marcus? I guess about as well as she knew me. That doesn't mean I don't love her. Everything I did was to give Alina the kind of life I thought she wanted. Without her, nothing matters. Nothing. So unless you find her, you can forget about me testifying. Marcus... Whatever I have to do to keep Alina safe, I will do it, okay? Even if that means giving myself up to Basayev. All right. Call records. She checked her messages before she left, but it the phone's been off since then. We can't track her unless she turns it back on. Credit cards? The last transaction was the atm in the motel lobby. She was obviously smart enough to know we'd be looking. All right. We've got an "attempt to locate" out, notify the bus terminals, airports, but let's face it: It's probably tipped off Basayev that she's in play. What? The last transaction before she took the cash, it's at her hotel in palm Springs, the palace. Oh, yeah. We called. She's not there. Did we send somebody out? I just said she's not there. She's not at any of the other places on Marcus' list either. At least we know she was there for three days before she bolted. Maybe she said something to someone that'll give us somewhere to dig. So you want to go talk to a hotel staff instead of her friends? Yeah. You coming? Morning. How can I help you gentlemen? I'm detective britten. This is detective Freeman. We're looking for a missing person who was a guest here over the weekend. Yes, the clerk told me. Mrs. Ananyev. How can I help? We'd like any information that might help us track her down. So, uh, she spoke to anyone in the hotel? She used any of the services? Maybe made a call from her phone? Let me pull up her folio. I'm afraid there were no calls, and no indication she used any guest amenities except for room service. Thank you. That is a steep room service charge, if you don't mind me saying. That's one expensive breakfast for a woman someone who can't weigh more than 110. Was Mrs. Ananyev staying here with someone? I'm afraid I don't know. She registered for a single king-size bed. Mm-hmm. Is your bartender on yet? Russian accent, a lot of jewelry? She ran up a hefty bill for someone drinking alone. Yeah. Yeah, I remember. She wasn't alone. All right. Who was she with? I assumed it was her husband. You get a name? No. But he was here before her, bought himself a drink. I can probably pull the credit card slip. What did he look like, this guy? Blond, about your height. It looks like he spent a lot of time at the gym. Hold on. I'm coming. Yes? Greg hollander? Shh! He's not answering his cell. Maybe we're too late. Maybe they're already on their way to Cabo. Let's put out an attempt to locate. See anything? No. I'll go get a warrant. Go back inside, take a look. That's gonna take all day. What else we gonna do? Set? Yep. Major crimes confirmed they're muscle for Basayev, fresh off the boat. It's probably why we didn't recognize 'em. I'm gonna go talk to him, see if I can't get anything. What about lover boy? They tell me he's got no connection with the accountant, with Basayev. Maybe he just hooked up with the wrong woman. I'll catch up with you later. Okay. Look straight ahead. All right, give me a minute here. You can finish later. All right, Greg, what'd you tell them? Nothing. Come on, Greg. Your face looks like a tray of lasagna. It's okay. You got nothing to be ashamed of. You can't expect me to believe you didn't tell them where she was? I don't know where she is. And even if I did, I wouldn't put Alina in harm's way. She's my friend. I love her. Oh, and someone else figured that out. Any idea who could have pointed them in this direction? Could've been anyone. Maybe she told a friend about me. Maybe one of my clients saw us together. What's your line of work? I... Provide companionship. Upon request. To men. So, your relationship with Ms. Ananyev... Wouldn't be...? I mean, you wouldn't have, uh...? Even if I was straight, that's not what Alina was after. What was she after? Just someone to be with. Someone to talk to, have fun with. And did she give you money for your time? I never asked for it. She forced it on me. Forced. Like she was allergic to it. But she kept insisting, so... I'm letting her pay for my schutzhund certification. Your... sorry. Your what? I want to train dogs for a living. And, uh, how did you two meet? We go to the same gym. We just... I don't know... we clicked. We'd go out for drinks at silly clubs. We'd go dancing. She's always dancing. You ever hear her laugh? No. I doubt anyone but me has in a long time. You mean her husband? Especially her husband. So, she mentioned him? That's really all she ever talked about. How happy they used to be when they first got married, and how sad it made her that they'd grown so far apart. Hey. Britten's on the phone for you. Did you find her? I told you you can forget my help until I know Alina's safe. I told you that! Calm down. We're on the same team. I just need some help here. I need some background. Where did you guys meet? New York. Why? What about places you used to go on the east coast? Before you got the job. A place that felt special. I don't know. I don't know. It was so long ago. We didn't really have money to go anywhere at all. Why are you asking me this? Put it this way: That young couple that you were, if you ran away together, where would you be? Yeah, there is one place, but, uh... I don't know if it's even still there. Alina. You're going to take me back? Basayev's been looking for you as hard as we have. That leaves you with two options. Either you enter witness protection with your husband, or I can try and arrange for you to enter separately. What should I do? I guess that depends. On what? On how you feel about your husband. Marcus told me where to find you. He knew you'd be here. He remembered this place. He said, uh, you used to vacation here? Yes. After your marriage. It was only six Miles away from our house. It wasn't much nicer then. But it had this view. And... and somehow it was enough. We were happy here. And then he took the job, and we had money, and we traveled to places much more beautiful than this. Places we had dreamed about. It was never the same. I didn't know what he did, but I know it changed him. It changed me. I just don't think a person can go back again. Maybe not, but maybe you have a chance to start over. And that's one more chance than most people get. I know one suitcase isn't much to take into a new life, but honestly, I don't know if you need to take anything if you love each other. Keep those separate for now. You want to take the stuff on the left? Got it? Hey. Hey. I thought you cancelled the goodwill. I did. Then I, uh, un-cancelled it. Want a coffee? Sure. So, when did you have a chance to go through all those boxes? I didn't. I just figured whatever you want to give away is fine by me. Really? Yeah. So, wh-what happened? What changed your mind? I slept on it. And I realized you don't need a 20-year-old cassette if you've still got the song. All right, you busy tonight? No. Wrong. I'm taking you out. Really? Mm-hmm. Where? It's a surprise. The new italian restaurant we've been wanting to try? Not a new place. Okay, you've got to give me a clue. I just did. I'll see you. I sent flowers when your kid died. I don't do flowers for anybody. Especially not a cop. It's not something you hand off like an old coat that doesn't fit anymore. I know, Jake. No, you don't know nothing. You try to buy me off with a couple of cuban cigars? Smoking them with somebody I considered to be a friend... that's all I cared about. You're right. You're absolutely right. That's why I'm here to apologize. You were a friend. You are a friend still. And I'm gonna miss our dinners together. All of it. And if you don't want to work with Vega, that's your call. I think he's a good kid. To be honest with you, he's the one that pointed out how badly I messed up with you. If you're interested, we'll do it right. We'll go out for a nice steak dinner, and I'll make a proper introduction. But if not, then so be it. Tell you what. Me and the kid, we'll have dinner alone, okay? I'm not invited? No, just me and him. I mean, if it's gonna be us, let's see if it can be us, you know? You know what I mean? Sure. By the way, the, uh, that tip that I gave you about the crew, it's a good tip. I gave you the wrong details, though. I'll give the kid the right ones. Okay. Thanks, my friend. You take care of yourself. You, too. Oregon? Who lives in Oregon? Oh, my God. It looks exactly the same. Yeah. Why'd you bring me here? I guess I thought we could go back to the beginning, you know? Where it all started. When it was just us. I can't believe that was us. It's like we were like different people. We were so young. Well, you were young. I was... You were cute. Very cute. I was persistent. I had to wrestle you away from that water-polo-playing jackass. Lars. His name was Mars. Oh. For the record. What kind of parents call their kid Mars? Well, they happened to be very nice people. You know, I wouldn't give yourself too much credit for being persistent. I was the one who came up to you. Actually, you went around asking everyone where your towel was, and I came up to you and gave you my towel. You know that's not how... Yeah. Well, I'm glad you did. Me, too. I do remember we started talking, and we just talked and talked. Sat right over there. Mm-hmm. By the time we looked up, they'd closed the pool. You remember what happened after that? What we did next? No. Yes. I forgot about that. Hey. What do you think? No. No, it's crazy talk. I'm not... Yeah, what, you're scared? Oh... Are you sure about this? Nope. One... Two... Oh, that's new. Come on. Stand by that thing; I'll go and get the clothes. No, let's just run for the car. My keys are in my pocket. Hey, Michael. What? I love you. Uh-oh.
