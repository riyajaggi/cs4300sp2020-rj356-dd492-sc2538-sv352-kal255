 Awake (2012): Season 1, Episode 11 - Say Hello to My Little Friend - full transcript 
 For the first time since the accident, when Michael falls asleep next to his wife, he does not wake up in the reality with his son. Dr. Lee says this is progress, finally acknowledging the boy's death. A man who Michael saw in his last moments in his son's world turns up as a talkative figment of Michael's imagination: Michael thinks the man holds the key to getting back to his son. He behaves oddly in front of Vega, he's distracted during an encounter with Emma's father, in his head he replays the fatal accident over and over, and the captain suspends him when he violates protocol. Who's the man in his mind - and what about the accident?

 I can see it you're upset. I shouldn't be here. This is not how it works. I understand. Let's just talk this through, together. Tell me how this all started. I was... There, with Rex, at this carnival thing. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the annual cops for kids event! Rex!

 Guys! Hi. How's it going, dad? Pretty good. Hi, Emma, how are you? Hello. No costume? No, I'm all done with mine, but... Bird's still in his. You catch Rex? How you doing there? But keep moving along. Keep moving. Five dollars for anybody who shoots the... Okay, what are we going on first? Can we bungee-jump?

 Please? He-he doesn't like heights. I don't like trusting my life to a rubber band. They're different, and it'll be really, really fun. Please? Please? Can we, please? Sure. I'm sorry. My fault. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. You okay? Okay, who's going first? I guess that would be me. Dad, you sure? Do you want to go? All right. What do I do? Just step over here through the gate. When we're ready, I'm gonna count backwards from three, and then you jump. Let me just check all restraints. Dad? Dad? Sir, wait! I still need to... Dad! Bad dream? Yeah. And that's the last thing you remember? Falling? And what about when you woke up? At first, I was trying to figure out what it meant, if it meant anything, and then as the day went on, I... got so busy, I didn't think about it any more. Tell me about your day. There. You can see the heart beat. Okay, that's yours. Thanks for coming. Of course. You all right? Yeah. I just wish my own parents could see this. When was the last time you talked to them? I texted her last night. She said that she was going to bring some clothes over. Well, there you go. Maybe when she sees this... I gotta go. I'll see you guys at dinner? All right. Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Britten. Michael. Thanks, Michael. All right. Bye. Bye. So this sicko from yesterday walks right in here, not a care in the world, right past the cameras. That's Petrowski. So while we're across town chasing him for yesterday's murder, he shows up and commits another one. Guess he wasn't kidding in his journals. This guy is now officially on a spree. Was it random? No. He knew the victim. I got a couple of co-workers say they remember Petrowski from when he worked on a contract three years ago, and he got on well with Mr. Kalmack here. So yesterday, he commits a murder at a bus stop for no apparent reason. And today, he shows up and stabs a guy he got along with. He's out of his mind. Get used to it. There's a lot of it around. He's hearing a voice telling him to kill people, and I'm hearing one telling us to stop this guy. Quick. And this suspect, you still haven't found him yet? No. Not so far. What about last night? Was there anything unusual about your routine? No. I mean, as I lay down, I remembered the carnival and the fall, and I wondered what exactly would be waiting for me when I got back there. When I woke up, I realized that I-I hadn't gone back at all. And that's never happened before. No. No, I always switch. Hannah, Rex, Hannah, Rex. It's-it's like clockwork. So what does this all mean to you? What does it mean? Doctor, it means you need to figure out a way to get me back to my son. Now. So tell me how this works. I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, I'm awake with my son. And this has been happening since the accident? So you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream. It all feels completely real to me. You can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment? Well, I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream. That's exactly what the other shrink said. AWAKE S01 Ep 11 - Say Hello To My Little Friend sync and corrected by dr.jackson for www.addic7ed.com I understand how you feel. But you should know that this is also actually a very positive sign of progress. You know, if you understood how I felt, you wouldn't use a word like "progress." Something is not right. Something's just... Something's broke or something's interrupted. Let's not look for a complicated explanation when there's a simple one readily available. The last time that you saw Rex, how did it end? You were standing on this platform and then suddenly you're failing and failing and boom... you wake up. Doesn't that sound like the end of a dream to you? Failing is one of the most common ways in which we transition out of a dream state, and that transition comes from your subconscious. It comes from you. This is not me telling you that Rex is a dream. This is you trying to tell yourself. Doesn't make any sense. Why? Why would it suddenly stop now? Well, you got a lot going on, things that require not only your attention, but your emotional investment. I-I-in addition to this urgent case, you and your wife are having a grandchild. There is a teenager living in your house. Isn't it possible that this life is starting to feel full and real in a way that is finally beginning to help you let go of your son? No. This is... this is temporary. I can face that there's something I'm not seeing. That's all. You are on the verge of a breakthrough, and the biggest mistake that you can make right now is to act as if it's a setback. I will not lose my son. Detective, you lost your son six months ago. Hi. What are you doing in my car? Relax. Don't tell me "relax". Show me your hands! Who are you?! I don't know. What does that mean? It means I don't know. Wait. I know you. I know you. I... I bumped into you at-at... That carnival thing. That was... that was the last time I saw Rex. Okay. Detective Britten? So glad I caught you. It was just sitting there in the chair. I was getting ready for my next patient. Everything okay? Yeah. Detective? I'm fine. Thanks. You don't well Detective. What is this? How did you...? Well, either I just leapt through time and space or ding, ding, ding! You're hallucinating. Why am I seeing you? I don't know. Is it to do with Rex? Why can't I get back to Rex? I don't know. Stop saying that. Is it to do with the case? The Petrowski case? Okay. Okay? Listen, Detective, I'm your imagination. I can only say what you tell me to say. I tell Vega, and I catch the Petrowski case, I go to sleep, bump into you there with Rex... Right. ...and, uh, I come back here, there's a murder, and now I'm stuck here, and then... Are you someone he works with? Are you a friend? Why are we reinterviewing these people? They barely knew the guy. None of them have seen him in three years. We should be out there trying to track Petrowski down. We been out there for a day and a half. We got nothing. We're missing something, some detail. Like what? A short guy, kinda strange-looking, a big chin pale blue eyes. Might have been a friend of Petrowski's or just somebody you saw him talking to one time here, or-or outside the building, maybe. I don't remember anybody like that. Petrowski's your prototypical loner. He ate lunch by himself in his cubicle. He didn't talk to us unless he was working on our computers. Bruce is the only one he really talked to, and you know, he got stabbed to death for it. What about other employees... People who worked here in the past? Somebody he might have crossed paths with? I've done H.R. here for the last 15 years. I don't recall ever having an employee like that. Somebody else in the building, perhaps. It doesn't ring a bell, but who is this guy? He's just someone we need to talk to. Big chin? Pale eyes? Where are you getting this? I can't say. You can't say? What does that even mean? I have a... source. I'm not sure if he's reliable. Now you think I'm unreliable. That hurts. Can we go? Petrowski's lived next to me for, like, five years and I've never seen anyone like that in the building. There's a short woman that lives in one of the units. No, no. Maybe somebody that delivered something to the apartment or did some work there. I've never seen him with anyone. In the past month or so, I'd see him in the hallway. He'd complain about these headaches, but that was the most I'd ever spoken to him. I mean you could tell he wasn't well, but to go off like this... Do people really do that? All the time. - Right, Detective? - I'm sorry. I've got an appointment. Can I go? Yes. You'll call me if you remember anything? Of course. I know what this is. It's the "little guy" thing all over again. The what? The homeless case. Where you were obsessed looking for the little guy. You were looking for me before? Why are we looking for someone no one has ever seen? Listen, if you don't like it... No, if you don't tell me about the source, then don't expect me to follow... I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango? thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me You guys are killing me. You're killing me. It's funny. This-this is a sacred song from my childhood. You're destroying the sacred song. - We're making you crazy. - You're killing me. All right, Rex, again. Okay. No, no. Galileo, Galileo... Galileo, Galileo... Michael? You all right? Come on. Let's get you to the paramedics. - No. - No, let me get the medics. I'm fine! I've a... I've a bug or something. I'm gonna go home. - Mike, are you sure? - Here, take me home. I'll... I'll work from there. How did it go today? It was good. I mean, she cried, I cried. Just... you can tell she wants me back. I mean, it's obviously just dad right now. Have you talked to him? No. He won't even answer my calls. I've never seen him this bad. Michael, I wonder if it's time for you to reach out to him again, father-to-father, you know? You can be so persuasive when you try. Right, yeah. I mean, I'd be happy to talk to him. I'll try. I don't know, Emma. What is it? I don't, uh... I will speak to him, of course. You all right? Yeah. No, you know, I'm not feeling very well. I think I'm gonna go lay down, - all right? - Okay. You don't feel warm. Was it something you ate? No, it's my head. I'll be fine in the morning. Morning. What's going on? I don't understand. Why can't I get back to...? Yeah? I just got a tip on Petrowski. Apparently, he crashed with some guy he knew from the Internet. He bolted this morning. A tipster called it in as soon as he realized that we were looking for him. What does his friend look like? I don't... I'm not doing this again, Mike. All right. Text me the address. I'll meet you there. Is this gonna be you? I hope so. You're not that fun to hang out with. The feeling's mutual. I still can't belive. I mean, murder? He slept right there. That's, like, crazy. So, how do you know Mr. Petrowski? I found him online. I needed a programmer for my web site. I do real estate. He was really fast and really cheap, and we got to be friends. At least online. Then yesterday he calls me up and says there's a problem in his apartment. Is there a chance that he could crash here tonight? And I'm, like... Bless you. You have cats? Two of them. You know, Roland was allergic, too. He couldn't stop sneezing. I actually thought maybe that was the reason why he just bolted without saying good-bye. And then I saw the news. Did he say anything about where he was headed? No, nothing. Bless you. Did he... did he mention anyone else? Anyone specific? No. Like who? Like, a short guy? Or, or anyone, family, friends? Anyone? I wish I could help. I really do. I'm sorry. No. Bless you. For before. We'd like to monitor your calls if you don't mind. Yes, please. What was on this table last night? I don't know. Right here. There's something... Can you see droplets around it? You must have sneezed around it. It looks like a piece of paper. It was probably my foreclosure listings. I had just gotten a new batch in. And then I printed them out, and I was actually... A list of vacant houses? Yeah. Can you get a copy, please? Of course. LAPD! Open up! Stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop! Hands up! Hands up now! Get on the ground! Hands up! Turn around slowly! Keep your hands up! Get your head up! Keep still! In custody. - Nice move. - Thanks. It's Muay Thai. You should come. I'm sick. I don't know what's wrong with me. I tried to see a doctor to have them X-ray my head or something, but they just sent me home. I keep having these thoughts. You don't know what it's like to not be able to control what's in your own head. When I saw the guy at the bus stop, something just clicked. Thought all these people, maybe somebody would stop me, but... Why Mr. Kalmack? He was always so nice to me. I don't have many friends. He would talk to me, maybe help explain to me what to do. But I was talking to him, I was looking at him, and I couldn't stop staring at the letter opener on the desk. And it was like I just had to... I didn't even know what was happening until he was... Part of it didn't even feel real. It felt like I was like I was dreaming. And then I woke up, and he was dead. And then you ran. Where did you go to? I just drove around. My head was all messed up. Called Thompson, but then I thought, "what if it happened again?" What if I something to him? So, I.. So I just got out of there. Did you talk to anyone? No. Why? Anyone you knew from, uh... work? Maybe a short guy, dark hair? - Detective... - No. What is he talking about? Mr. Petrowski, can you give us a minute? He already confessed! What the hell are you doing? I just want to make sure we're not missing anything. You're compromising the case. You plant the idea that we're looking for some guy, whoever this guy is, the attorney starts spinning, and all of a sudden there's doubt. The whole thing falls apart. It is over. We got him. He confessed, all right?! Go home. I'll finish taking the statement. Hello? Are you here? No, no, no... Please. Rex! Rex! No, there's no reason for you to be here. The case is closed. And yet here we are. Why am I still here? Why won't you let me get back to my son? I told you. I know what you know. You thought it was about the case, so... I thought it was about the case. What is it about? Well, maybe it's not about anything. Maybe Dr. Lee was just right. - Maybe this is all there is. - No. No. - I think so. - I won't have that. - There's something... - Michael? Who are you talking to? No one. I, I'm talking to myself. Just working something out. Y-you feeling all right? Yeah, yeah, it's that, uh, you know, I had a tough couple of days. Tough cases. It's complicated sometimes. Okay. You know you're meeting Emma's father today. - No, I can't. - Michael, please. - Listen, I can't. I... - Michael... I feel like the longer that this goes unresolved, the worse it gets for everybody. Just talk to him. I feel like you could really reach him. Yeah. Sure. Would you just leave me alone for a few minutes? How could I leave you alone if I'm you? Just stay here. As much as you and your wife have seen fit to insert yourselves into my family's business, this is between Emma, her mother, and myself. Look, I have no desire to stick my nose in where it doesn't belong. But you have to understand, she's living at my house. So, I'm forced... So... I thought if we... you and I... could talk face to face... My daughter has no idea what she's getting herself into. She's come to believe that raising a baby will be no more than a hiccup. Now, her mother and I are trying to impress Michael, come here. Upon her exactly how isolating and difficult this whole... Michael, I think you need to see this. - Come over here. - Are you listening to me?! - Over there... look! - Absolutely. - You... - You asked to see me. I-I-I-I'm not feeling, Michael, look at this! You've got to see this. Why don't you say what you have to say, hmm? - Michael! Come out here right now! - Otherwise, let my wife and I... Handle things. Excuse me?! No, I, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, uh... Michael, come here. Michael, I see me. Through the window... that's me! I see me! Look! Outside the window! That's me! What are you doing!? Get off the road! Stop! I told you to look! I told you, and you wouldn't listen! I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango? thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening You guys are killing me. - You're destroying a sacred song. - We're making you crazy. - You're killing me! - All right, Rex again! No, no! Okay. Galileo, Galileo... Galileo, Galileo... Are you okay?! Are you all right? I saw someone I... I need to talk to. But what were you thinking? You almost got yourself killed. Where you going? I'm pursuing a lead. You can't go! You can't leave the accident! You can't leave the scene of an accident! Little heavier on the eyebrows. Like this? Yeah. Can you stretch it out? Make it longer? Stop! Stop. Stop. That's him. That's not bad. You said he was short? Like 5'5 ", 5'6". - Listen, can you... - Michael, what's going on? We just got reports of an accident - and you were on the scene? - Not now, not now. Harper wants to talk to you. Not now, Vega! Can we look for a match? I know who this is. What? He's in the system? This is Ed Hawkins over at the West bureau. He's a cop? He's partnered up with Isaiah Freeman. Bird? Is that your old partner? Michael, wait. What am I supposed to tell Harper? So, they ship me off to Western. We barely talk for a couple of months, and then you need to meet me in ten minutes? I know, I'm sorry. I just, uh... What do you make of your new partner? Ed? Well, he seems like good people, you know? He's sharp on the scene, has your back in the office, why? I don't know... I keep... I mean, I... I got something going on. And, uh... I can't figure out... Bird, we got to go! Ed, hey. This Ed Hawkins. Michael. Michael Britten. Yeah, yeah, I know. Bird talks about you all the time, mostly as a not so subtle way of pointing out I'm slower than his old partner. Did I see you this morning on Beverly? Beverly? Yeah, yeah, maybe. My doc's right there. Anyway, good to see you. Wait. H-h-hang on. Let me ask you something. I know this is going to sound weird, but... Do we know each other? Somewhere, I mean, I feel like... Were you working? Something... w-we... Met somewhere? You don't remember? What? Your accident, Michael. I was one of the first on the scene. I tried to help. Yeah... I don't remember much. Yeah, of course. I can imagine. I... sorry about your son. Give us a second. Mike, you all right? Yeah. Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? caught in a landslide no escape from reality open your eyes look up to the skies... I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango? thunderbolt and lightning very, very frightening You're killing me. You're killing me. This-this is a sacred song from my childhood. You're destroying a sacred song. You're killing me. Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo... All right. - If you want us to stop, just say... - That'll shut you up. Mom, they train him to drive like this. I know! Absolutely. Just watch the curves, okay? Michael, what's going on? I talked to Emma. She was crying. She said that you said something or did something to her father. Something about running out into traffic? What are you doing on the floor? He's gone. He's really gone. He's gone. Michael. Everything's my fault. I did it. It's not your fault. I took our... ...our boy... My little baby boy... ...and I killed him. Look at me. Look at me. That was an accident. No, no, no. No. I don't... I don't blame you. Well, you should. You told me to slow down. Stop it. It... it... It's not okay. You were trying so hard to stay strong for me. You don't have to pretend any more. You don't have to do that. We're in this together. It's just us. Morning. Michael, you have to understand that I've always worried, that you were throwing yourself back into the job before you were ready. And I-I let you do that because you seemed to need it, and that was my mistake. But from where we sit now, with you chasing imaginary leads and the department looking at lawsuits and thousands of dollars in property dam... Not to mention, how do I explain that one of my officers ran through traffic and then ran away from the scene of the resulting accidents? I'm sorry. I... I thought I was through the worst of it. I'm sorry. They're going to hand down a suspension, pending a full investigation into your actions. I think you need to take this time to do what you weren't ready or able to do before. Just let yourself process. Let yourself grieve. And then, we'll see where we are. I killed my son, Captain. You can keep them. I'm sorry. I'm s... I'm so sorry. What are you doing here? What do you want from me? I don't know. Look, I get it, okay? I remember. I-I... I give up. Can't you just go? Can't you just... Can't you just leave me alone? Thanks for agreeing to see me. And I... I apologize for my behavior the other day. The truth is that... I don't know if it's Emma and the baby or... what. And I'm-I'm having a lot more difficulty dealing with Rex's death than I thought. And... I know I'm in no position to tell you what to do. I just wanted to tell you that losing a child is... ...is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. And-and to watch you voluntarily cut yourself off from her... I would give anything... Anything for one more day... One more hour... ...one more... One more second with my boy. You know? And, uh, and... You can hate her or her decision or the baby or us, but none of it matters. You just hold her tight... And you don't let her go. Because she... You never know. That was a good joke on you, dad. It's my dad. Dad? Thank you. We don't know what he's saying yet. Yeah, well, they're talking. It's a start. Still kind of hard to believe, No, it's just starting to sink in. Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? caught in a landslide no escape from reality open your eyes look up to the skies I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango? thunderbolt and lightning... You guys are killing me. You're killing me. This-this is a sacred song from my childhood. You're destroying it. All right. - If you want us to stop, just say... - That'll shut you up. Mom, they trained him to drive like this. I know. Absolutely. Just watch the curves, okay? Let's do it again. From the top? Yeah. Have a heart. Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? caught in a landslide no escape from reality Dad? Dad? Rex. Thank God! My boy. I thought I'd never see you again. You okay? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. You okay, Mr. Britten? Yeah. Dr. Evans? Detective Britten? Can I see you? Now? If possible. What's going on? I need to talk something through with someone, and... You're the only one I can trust now. What is it? I was stuck, with Hannah. And I thought it was because I had to... I don't know... Accept or understand. But it wasn't that at all. I'm sorry. I don't understand. There was no accident. That's what I had to understand. They were trying to kill me. Who? Detective Britten, who was trying to kill you? Another cop. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. I'll meet you in half an hour.
