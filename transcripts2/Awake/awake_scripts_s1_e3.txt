 LEE: So tell me how this works. BRITTEN: I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes. I open them. I'm awake with my son. And this has been happening since the accident? LEE: So you begin working on one case here in reality, and then, suddenly, you begin working another case there, in your dream. BRITTEN: It all feels completely real to me. LEE: You can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?

 EVANS: Well, I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream. That's exactly what the other shrink said. AWAKE S01 Ep 03 - Guilty Sync and corrected by dr.jackson for www.addic7ed.com (whooshing, clicking) (prolonged beep) WOMAN: All done. You're always like a statue. Never seen anyone hold so still. One thing I've learned is patience. (garbled radio transmission) See you next week. Maybe not.

 Maybe I'll get lucky. Yeah? Who's going to give you a kidney? They don't put prisoners on no donor lists. A man can dream, can't he? Yeah? Keep dreaming. Who do you think you are, Cooper? My mother has to wait three months to see a doctor, and here you are, sucking the taxpayers' money. All right, let's go. (muffled grunting) Shut the door. Come on. Shut it! I got nothing to lose, Perez. You don't want to test a man with nothing to lose. Huh? Shut it! TARA: Ready? I guess. It's good you're nervous. Nerves are good before a tournament. But you're going to do great. Hey, Tara. Just watching this, uh, kid here... the favorite for the tournament. He's pretty good. Good? He's ranked like 15th in the state. I was telling Rex, he can beat him if he keeps him behind the baseline... I already have a coach, Dad. Which is why I'm thinking you really don't need to be there. BRITTEN: I don't need to be there. - I want to be there. - Why? So you can watch me lose? (sighs) (cell phone buzzing) Oh. - Sorry. - Yeah. Britten. TARA: Since when do you have a problem with your dad watching you play? BRITTEN: From where? - BRITTEN: Uh-huh. - His serve's, like, 100 miles an hour. I mean, how am I supposed to return that? When did this happen? BIRD: Five hours ago. CHP just flagged him on a traffic camera heading south on the 405. Which means he may be in the L.A. area. Captain's putting together a fugitive task force, you know, to check out all his known contacts. Some story. Guy's 14-year-old son ODs, he shoots the dealer and gets life in prison. Wait. Is this guy's name, uh... Cooper... John Cooper? Yeah. How'd you know that? I made the arrest. TARA: All you have to do is block it. Get your racquet on the ball, - and you'll be in the point. - I'll see you there. Something came up... work. I'm sorry. But, uh, if you make the final, it's-it's Sunday, right? I should be able to be there by Sunday. TARA: That'd be great. Don't get so broken up. Already said you didn't have to come, so it's fine. BRITTEN: Call me when you get there. (elevator bell dings) MAN: Sign right here. Jim. Hey. It's okay. Good to see you, Michael. Hey. How you holding up? Yeah, I'm... I'm good. Mm-hmm. How's Rex? Uh... he's playing tennis. He's in a tournament this weekend. I should be there, but, uh... Bet he's good. I remember how good Hannah was. Kicked your ass. (chuckling) So thanks for coming in on such short notice. Well, this was my case, too. I would have been pissed if you hadn't called me. All right. Let's get to the manhunt, like the old days. (chuckling) So... how did Cooper pull this off? Uh, he escaped after off-site dialysis treatment. Used a paralytic on a guard. Think he got it from the inside? Grilling the staff right now. Hey, you want to meet your predecessor? It's the guy I was stuck with before I was stuck with you. Jim, good to see you again, man. Good to see you, Bird. You know each other? We met. Hannah's funeral. (water running) - Hey. - Hey there, sweaty man. (panting) Hey, you want breakfast? I want to take a shower first. Hey, uh... hey, want to shower with me? Save water? Ah, for the sake of the environment. David called. Talked about the fundraiser tomorrow. I thought we told him we weren't going. Yeah, we did. The board is hiring a new crisis counselor, and they're going to name the position in Rex's honor. Wow. That's nice. Yeah. Place was important to him, you know? Volunteered there three times a week. What? I don't know, sweetie. You sure you're up for it? No. I just thought... it's going to be hard, but they're doing a whole memorial program for Rex. I feel like we should be there. LEE: So how did you resolve this with Hannah? Well, how do you think? We're going to the fundraiser. And how do you feel about that? How do I feel? I-I just don't want her to get hurt. I want to protect her. Have you considered that maybe you want to protect something else? Like what? This dream of your son being alive. This event that you're so reluctant to attend, it's all about commemorating Rex. But how can you expect to memorialize a son whose death you haven't truly accepted? TARA: So, Rex, was that really about not wanting your dad to see you play, or were you just giving him a hard time? If you don't want to talk about it, that's okay, too. He tries too hard. He always wants to... talk and hang out like we're best friends or something. This is your complaint? I just don't want to deal with him right now. He almost lost you. I think you can handle a few hugs and some awkward conversation. He's not the problem. I am. What does that mean? It means I'm a terrible person. You're not terrible; you're a teenager. It's... When it's just the two of us and he's asking me about my day, making my dinner, trying to talk about sports, being nothing but nice to me... I can't stop thinking that... I wish I had her instead of him. What kind of person looks someone in the eye, someone who's trying so hard... and wishes they were dead instead of someone else? Every time he smiles at me, every time he hugs me and says he loves me... (stammers) I'm-I'm afraid he's going to see that... I didn't choose him. That I want her instead. Having those feelings doesn't make you a bad person. There's no right way or wrong way to feel about what's happened. But whatever you're feeling, you shouldn't have to keep it to yourself. So it's good that you're telling me. (crashing) What the hell? You okay? I'm fine. All right. Stay here. Be right back. It's not too bad. Just a small dent. Look, we really need to be somewhere, so I'd rather not wait around to file a police report. (gasping, screaming) TARA: The guy who took Rex was wearing, um, a green sweatshirt with a hood on it. I-I just told the officer. Tell me... what did he say? He didn't say anything. Not a word? Not a sound? Before I knew what was happening, he put this cloth over my mouth, which had this chemical smell, and... and that's it. That's... that's all I remember. No. No, you got to remember something else. - You're forgetting something, some detail. - No, I'm not. - I'm not. - What car was he driving? I don't know. I... Was he armed? No. I don't... oh... Tara, think. Cooper wants something. I need to know what. - You're forgetting something. - I'm sorry, Michael. Michael, come on. (crying) Sorry. She told us everything she knows. (cell phone ringing) Uh... Yeah? What? JIM: Tara's cell phone hasn't turned up yet. If Rex grabbed it, we might be able to get a location. Doesn't make any sense. What does he want with Rex? Wants to get back at you. You were one of his arresting officers. So were you. If he wanted revenge, we'd be dead already. Why didn't he come after us? He... he wants something. Well, whatever he wants, we'll find out soon enough. We're tapping your phones in case he tries to get contact. Hey. Cooper's dialysis nurse, they gave her a field polygraph... she failed. Now, if she helped Cooper, then... Might know where Rex is. â™ª (grunts) (phone beeps) I don't know what you want... but you should know that my father's a cop. Pretty soon, there'll be a lot of people looking for me. So before you do something you can't take back... please just... let me go. Okay? Please. Please. Help! Someone help me, please! Help! As God is my witness, I wouldn't have helped him if I'd known this would happen. You're an accessory. You understand that? That means in the eyes of the law, you're as guilty as Cooper. And kidnapping carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. I swear, I don't know where he took your son, so I can't tell you. He never mentioned a specific place? What about a person he was in contact with? A friend, a family member? He doesn't have anyone. Not anymore. I was the only one. We spent three hours a day together, twice a week. He asked me to pray with him. He said he was innocent. Yeah. I hope one day you'll forgive me. I'll pray for your son. (door slams) Where's Jim? Coordinating the canvass. Anyone Cooper's ever known, anyone who visited him in prison, we're running them down. The witness Tara finished giving her statement. She's at your desk. She wants to talk to you. Hey, Tara. You okay? He called. Cooper... he left a message on my home machine. He called your house? I called in my voice mail and the message was there. - When? - Just now. What'd he say? He left his number, and he wants you to call him. Michael, Michael. He said if you tell anyone, he'll know, and he'll kill Rex. This is Detective Britten, badge 8277. I need you to do a reverse look-up. 310-555-1212. WOMAN: Checking. Just a moment, Detective. Detective? Yeah. That number is a public phone on McClintock Avenue and Third Street. No, that's the address of the station I'm calling from. It's also where the pay phone is located, sir. On the Northwest corner. - Cooper? - Who?! - Where is he? - Dude who gave me this? - Yeah. - Said he'd give me another 20 if I stood here for a couple hours. I told him fine, I ain't got no prior engagements. All right, get out of here. - What about my other $20? - Go! (phone ringing) Cooper? REX: Dad, it's me. Rex? Son, are you all right? I'm in the desert, some kind of shack, - two hours from downtown...! - Shut up! Rex! COOPER: Shut up! (muffled screaming) Rex! If you ever want to see your son alive again, do exactly what I tell you. I'm listening. 10:00. 2211 Industrial Road in San Bernardino. Come alone. I see anyone else... I even think I see anyone else... and your boy is gonna die. You understand me? I understand. I'll do whatever you want. But... don't hurt him. Please. (line clicks) Cooper? Cooper?! I'm sorry it's come to this. No son should ever have to pay for the sins of his father. Stand up. Stand up! Where's my son? Tell me where he is! Now! Even if I tell you where he is, by the time you figure out if I'm telling you the truth, your son will be dead of dehydration. You won't find him without me. So take your hands off of me, and let's talk. What do you want? Same thing I wanted for the last ten years: justice. Derek Bell deserved to die, but I didn't kill him. Just tell me what I have to do to get my son back. Prove who set me up. Nobody set you up. Somebody planted that gun that night. You just didn't look close enough. It took me ten years, but I finally figured out who killed Derek Bell that night. And you're going to help me prove it. (clatter in distance) - MAN: Drop your weapon! - W-Wait. No, no, no, no! Hold it! (gunfire) No! No! No! (men shouting in distance) Cooper. Hey, Cooper. They're not with me, I swear. Cooper! Tell me where my son is. Please. Please tell me where he is. Suspect is down. Where is he? No. No. (grunting) I can't lose him again. Come on! Michael. Get off me! You just killed my son. You just killed my son! Let's get him out of here. (sirens wailing in distance) Why did you follow me? Captain thought Cooper might try to contact you. Well, did he say anything? I mean, anything we can use to find Rex? He was just about to. About to what? About to tell me. How I can help him prove his innocence. Come on, Mike. Innocent man wouldn't kidnap Rex. Look, don't do this to yourself. None of this is your fault. Cooper was guilty. Best thing you can do for Rex right now is to get a clear head. There's nothing you can do here that isn't already being done. What, I should go home? What are you suggesting, I take a rest? (shower knob creaks, water stops running) Hey, Vega, you near your desk? VEGA: Uh, I can be. Why? I need you to access the state prison database for me, look up the status of an inmate. His name is John Cooper. What's this about? Time sensitive, Vega. Well, that doesn't answer my question. Just tell me if he's still in Tehachapi Prison. Name is John... John Cooper. Yeah, I heard you the first time. Yeah, Cooper's still locked up. What's going on? I'm taking the day off. Cover for me. I'm going up to Tehachapi. Because of this guy Cooper? All right, you're not telling me. What am I supposed to tell the captain? Whatever you want. And I'm supposed to do that because...? Because you're my partner. You know, that's supposed to go both ways, Michael. I'll call you back. - You're awake. - Hey. And dressed. Wow, you were tossing and turning last night. Did you have a bad dream? I didn't sleep very well, either. I think I was probably obsessing about today. Today? I've been thinking. Maybe one of us should say something, since they're doing this thing for Rex. (sighs) Honey... I'm not going to make the fundraiser. I'm really sorry. You're not gonna make it? What? I can't, I... I, uh... - That was Vega on the phone, there's a... - But you... been a child abduction. The kid's about the same age as Rex. Michael... - They called me. - O-Okay, that's awful, but you're not the only detective on duty. I know. The fundraiser's two hours. - They need me. -They need you? I need you! I... Michael, it's two hours. Okay? You can go back to work after. I-I... Bad things are always going to be happening to other people, but s-something really bad happened to us. I know. So? Be with me today. Honey, I can't. I... (door shuts) HANNAH: My son started volunteering here about a year ago, and, honestly, he did it because of the community service requirement at school. At first, all my husband and I heard, over and over, was... "Why do I have to do this?" I think he was counting down days till he could go back to hanging out with his friends after school, instead of manning the phones here. But eventually, and without us even really noticing, he-he stopped complaining. And one night, Rex didn't come home when he was supposed to, and... and he wasn't answering his phone. I was so worried. I found him here... two hours after his shift had ended, and he was on the phone with some 14-year-old girl who was depressed and thinking about hurting herself. I stood behind Rex for close to an hour, and I watched him... slowly convince this girl to get help. Here was this person that I had held in my arms as a baby... who had just saved someone's life. And this wave of pride, I felt it. And I... I grabbed him and I hugged him and... (voice breaks): I started crying. I couldn't stop. And Rex just said I was embarrassing him, and he asked me to leave. (chuckling) So I left... with a gift that I'll always carry with me. That night... in this room... Rex showed me who he really was... and he gave me a glimpse of the man he would have become. Thank you for remembering my son today... and for being a part of this wonderful place. Hey, hon, it's me. I hope it's going okay. I'm sorry I'm not there. (applause) You know, I'm sure it-it's not what you want to hear right now, but... (sighs) I'm doing the best I can. Whoever finds this... please get it to my father. He's a detective with the LAPD, Michael Britten. I was hoping to talk to him face-to-face, but... it's starting to look like that may not happen. (indistinct voices) (door lock buzzes) BRITTEN: No, don't die! Except for my ex-wife, you're the last person I ever expected to lay eyes on again. I'm here because after your appeal was rejected, I got a call from an anonymous source. He said he was familiar with your case and he had evidence that could prove your innocence. Really? Now, if I got it wrong about you, I'd like a chance to make things right. (chuckles) Make it right? Okay. How about you giving me back the last ten years of my life? Can you do that? No, but if you can corroborate what my source told me, I can get you out of here. Now, he mentioned something about a place in the desert. What can you tell me about that? Man, let me tell you something. I don't know what this is all about, but I know when I'm being played. Let's just say I do know where this place is. What's it got to do with proving I'm innocent? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Just like you don't believe me. You still believe that I killed Derek Bell, don't you? And the reason you don't believe me is because you don't want to. Because it means that you have to live with what you did to me. But I'm good, man. I-I don't need you to believe me anymore. I just need you to get me out of here. And after you do that, I'll tell you about this place in the desert. Well, it may be too late by then. Too late for who, man? All right, say you didn't kill Derek Bell. Tell me who you think did. For the longest time, I thought it was you. Yeah. See, I figured it had to be a cop, right? Someone who could control the evidence. Yeah. You know who I'm talking about. (phone rings) Hello? Jim, hey, it's me, Michael. Michael, hey, good to hear your voice. How are you? Oh, you know, still chasing bad guys. How's Hannah? We're hanging in there. Listen, gee, I apologize. I, uh, I've been meaning to reach out, invite you over for a beer. Sounds good. What about later? Yeah, that'd be great. Come on over. [Doorbell rings] - Michael! - Jim. Hey. It's been way too long. - Yeah. - Please. What's with the hand? Ah, it's nothing. A little accident at the gym. Margaret's been after me to lose ten pounds. She here? Margaret? No, sorry. You missed her. She sends you her love. Can I get you a beer? To be honest with you, I'm not really here on a social call. Something with Hannah? No, Hannah's good. Oh, thank God. We have to talk, Jim, about, uh... John Cooper. He's doing life for killing Derek Bell. You remember. Bell was holding a million dollars in cash that night, and then I remember we recovered less than $100,000. So... I did the math, and here I am. You killed Bell, you took the money, put the gun in Cooper's house. Where is this coming from? I got some of it from Cooper, from other places. I put the pieces together. Listen, you're taking the word of a condemned murderer over mine. Jim, you got me all wrong. I'm not here to bust you and I'm not here to judge you. I don't care if Cooper rots in jail the rest of his life. I just want what's mine. People get rich while people who put their lives on the line like us get next to nothing. I want my share. Your share? That was our bust. That is our money. Michael, I didn't frame anyone. There is no money. None of this is real. I don't think I'm making myself clear, Jim. I'm... I'm not giving you a choice. You pay me, or I will go to Internal Affairs. You can go talk to them all you want, but you're only gonna end up looking crazy. And from what I understand, you don't need much help. I'm sorry I said that. I talked to Captain Harper. She told me what's been going on since the accident; all the erratic behavior. I didn't realize how serious it is. That's not what's going on here, and you know it. She's got you seeing a psychiatrist. She assigned you a new partner to keep an eye on you. Are you cutting me in or not? Listen to what you're saying. Look at yourself. Now, we need to get you some help. All right, that's enough. We're done. Tell you what. Let's call your doctor, huh? We could figure this out together. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna walk out the door, and I'm gonna go straight to the captain. Next that will happen, they'll subpoena your bank records, and you spend the rest of your life in prison like Cooper. Now is that what you want? I am your friend. I came here to give you a chance, but it's up to you to take it. It's your call. There isn't much left. (sighs) Amazing how fast the money goes... but what's left... it's yours. If I could, I'd take back everything that happened that night, but... the money was there, I pulled the trigger, and there was just no turning back. Michael? Michael, where are you going? I told you I'd give you the money. (indistinct radio transmission) Sir, you're under arrest for the murder of Derek Bell. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. (phone line ringing) Hey, for a minute, he had me wondering if you were making this whole thing up. You weren't the only one. This is Detective Michael Britten. I need to speak to Warden Gutierrez. Tell him it's an emergency. Warden, I need you to put John Cooper on the phone right now. (siren wailing) Still not sure why you can't tell me who tipped you on Cooper's place in the desert. Not allowed to give up the source. Not allowed? It's complicated. This source the same reason you got IA talking to Mayhew? Uh-huh. I got a friend over there. Heard they was pulling him in, looking into his bank accounts. They're saying Mayhew's the one who killed Derek Bell and took his money. Yeah. That means Cooper was innocent. Yeah. (sirens continue) (sirens cease) Rex! Rex! Inside! Rex! Watch out. (grunting) Rex! Rex, can you hear me? Dad... Rex? (sobs softly) Get in there. Rex, I'm a paramedic. I'm here to help you. Do you understand what I'm saying? Sorry, son. MEDIC: Skins are real hot. BRITTEN: You're gonna be all right. MEDIC: Backing out pretty good. Give me a line. Stay with us, buddy. I'm here with you now. MEDIC: Here you go. Lee: You know, at some unconscious level, you might have always suspected that Cooper was innocent. Cooper's failed appeal coincided with your son's death, which caused you to create a dream in which you had to prove Cooper's innocence. Or you would have to relive the loss of your son. If I had known, if I had suspected on any level there was something wrong with the Cooper case, I would have done something by myself a long time ago. But you didn't, and it's understandable why. People naturally flee from their own guilt. They push it aside. This dream was a way of forcing you to do the right thing. It's a kind of... reckoning for your conscience. An innocent man lost a decade of his life because I couldn't see the truth. I don't find that particularly admirable. So you blame yourself for wrongfully sending Cooper to prison, and for him ultimately dying? Of course I blame myself. It's my fault. I would argue it is Mayhew's fault more than it is yours. The point is, you felt guilty. And to alleviate that guilt, you created a dream where you freed Cooper. If that's the case, it didn't work. I don't feel any better about what happened to him. Isn't that interesting? Even when you go so far as to dream a world where everything turns out all right, you're still plagued with guilt. I'd like you to ask yourself something, Detective. Where do you think this inability to forgive yourself comes from? (monitor beeping) Hi. Hi. How's he doing? He's, he's okay. Doctors say he can go home tomorrow. Maybe the day after. That's great news. Yeah. I keep thinking if you hadn't found him... Hey, I did. If you're still blaming yourself for any of this, forget it. If it's anybody's fault, it's mine, all right? Come here. It's okay. Um... I came by to give you this. It's my phone. The, uh, crime scene guys found it and returned it to me. Turns out Rex recorded himself out there. You should hear what he had to say. Thanks. REX: If you're watching this, I'm guessing you're pretty messed up about what happened. But there's some things I really need to tell you... which as it turns out, I've... had a lot of time to think about. I know things haven't been so easy between us lately, that I haven't been... communicating. I think it's maybe because I was afraid of what I might say... because of how angry I was... about losing Mom. Mom was... she was really what held all of us together. Without her, I didn't know what to do. And I think you kind of felt the same way, too. But I want you to know... and this is really important... I don't blame you for what happened, for her being gone. So please don't blame yourself. Did you find him? The boy who was kidnapped? You find him? Yeah. Yeah, we did. Is he gonna be okay? Yeah... I think so. I thought about you all day. I really wanted to be there... be with you. I know. I'm sorry. So... how'd it go? It was hard... until it wasn't. There was just so much love. And I actually felt like he, he was in the room with me. I just kept wishing you were there, so you could know what that feels like. REX: We haven't talked about it in awhile... but I do think there's something else after this life. I want you to know I love you. And that's what I'm going to hold onto... until I see you again.
