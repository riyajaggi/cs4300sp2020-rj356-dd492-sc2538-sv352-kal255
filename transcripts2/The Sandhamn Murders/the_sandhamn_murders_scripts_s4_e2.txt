No, tomorrow we are going to the Opera. -I found good tickets. -Did you buy them already? Yes, otherwise we will not go. Yeah, where are going to the opera. -Yes. It will be fun. Yes, opera is perhaps the best thing in the world. -It smacks it. -But Glenn, hey. -I was just wondering where he was. Hi. -He'll give a damn about my birds. Otherwise, he gets to do it with me. No way. -Do you drink you wine? -Yes. Would you like a glass? Do not let me interrupt, but ... well, why not? Hey, Nora So you, you send the police after me. I hope it was okay. -Are you blackmailing Sven. -Yes. And unfortunately, I was probably not a great help to someone. But it stirred up old memories. -Really. Good or bad? -Corso is really a nice island. -I have never been there. -It's forbidden to go there. -Yeah, it sure is. Shall we take a trip? -Now? -Yes. It's a nice day. Or? Do you think your police officer will stop us if we go ashore? Come on now -What's the place? -An Old fortification. We used it as a training facility. -So this is where you practiced? -Yes. Or healed? The officers said: "What does your mom think would be the 10 percent of what you can handle. " "What do you think the 30% of what you can handle. " "We know what you're capable of. We know which demands war puts on you. " Well, so let it be. Come on. Here is where we practiced. We hit back as well from time to time. lose your grip, hit man after death. Well ... was it enough. There were worse than that exercises. -Got rid of all of them? -No. And no one was happier than the officers if someone broke down. Especially one was worse than all the others. Who was it, then? Yes, what was his name ...? I must have blocked it out. Or it is the age. It will get back to me. Anyway, this man went over all reasonable borders. Not that it was needed but because he was a sadist. I remember a guy who wanted to go home at any cost. He was about to escape together. Run! Come on now! What the hell are you doing? -Lasse! He was absolutely desperate. He injured himself on purpose. Just to avoid having to continue. -The Fick got home all right? -No, he ended up in the hospital. Then he had to go back and the officers continued bullying victims. It just got worse and worse until he completely cracked. Then he got to go home. Do you know what the officer did then? Then he stood up in the mess and emptied a bowl. And no one said anything? No, no one did. Damn. One can really feel how anxiety fills the walls. where we have old dormitories. We slept in here. Or didn't sleep ... For two weeks we slept a total of 18 hours. licking the floor, I said. You can not imagine how proud we were when we got our graduation ... after all the crap. Licking floor. -Was it worth it? -Well, it is doubtful. In here ... Damn! But you never protested? You have to understand one thing ... We were young boys and would become elite soldiers. Come on. It's still hot. It was about big things. Pride and honor and glory and stuff. It was important to get out ... a controlled aggressiveness. Stress tolerance would be pushed to the extreme That was an important part for the sake of that education. Now, I have asked all the staff. No one recognizes him. He looks well maybe for regular out. He has never tried to retrieve something? No, not what we can see. What did he write in your pharmacy in the calendar, then? How would I know that? We have not noticed him. rred Okay. Thanks. -Thanks. Not the pharmacy Stork recognized Marcus Nielsen. Preliminary autopsy report of Sven Ernskog. Clear marks on the chest, clear bruising under the skin. Was he hit by round objects? -A baseball bat, according to the coroner sign of blunt trauma to the head. -A baseball bat once again. It differs from Fredell. -For Weak to withstand. Both had green soap in the lungs. Thomas, Mia. They have found Bo Kaufman. It's not an accident. It was a suicide. Marcus told Bo about something that happened in the coastal command training. Bo realizes that Marcus knows too much and plans a revenge on Ernskog and Fredell. 0, it is difficult to submerge himself. But if it is full on the verge of unconsciousness so . Kaufman called Ernskog the same day he was out on Sandhamn. Okay. Somebody else? He has not been in contact with so many. Like Mia? Should Mia bring you home since you do not have a place to stay? You're the perfect cohabitant. -You Can not, you know. Can you write the report for I have to go? Where are you? -Sandhamn And then at the Opera. Opera? Thought I was not your thing. No, it is Pernillas thing. I would never set up. That's why you're single. We'll see you tomorrow. -Hello. - He is stupid. Keep. -Hello. Are Anna at home? No, she went to town yesterday. No ... Give it to her. -I Will not open. Good. -What is it? There's a police helicopter. Gick party good? Yes, despite the circumstances. Anna was satisfied in all cases. -Good. Do you have anything new about Sven's killer? either we have solved it or you ... -Jonas! Yeah. Do not say that it is wrong on the toilet. No time. I will come back later. No, I'm about. We reviewed. -Bye. Hi. -Hello. I'm just wondering about the offer from yesterday remains. Absolute. Now, at a time? -Yes why not. I knew it would come. It still feels like a failure. So I felt well. Though it is just stupid. That's just ... break down and move on I guess. Have you told Vera? No, we will. Where is she somewhere? in town. I understand if you do not want to rent the entire summer. Well, I have set myself to it. I still do not want to be in town. Vera will also, so ... It just feels so ... empty. Dumb and ... Now I'm one of those party pooper, that Vera would call it. No ... bowl. -Bowl. Wow. Are you going to go like that? That's a bit much maybe. No tie. Whatever I do, I can not match you.
