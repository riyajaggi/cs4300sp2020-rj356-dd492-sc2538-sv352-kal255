 See you. Nora. - Hello. - Hi. Holiday? I just left Elin. She will be with Grandma for a week. - It's been a long time since I saw you. - We work a lot. - See you tonight? - No, why? Jonssons who has built at Fyrudden. They have the big initiation party. - Oh!. Do you know them? - No. They have invited the whole island. I think they invited people from other islands too. It's always good to know a police officer. No, the police are not invited. But I wish you a lot of fun! See you. Both the sauna and the landing stage are built on our property. We get no answers to our letters.Let's take  a lifting crane and the shit will be gone.  Or are we being prosecuted then? Yes, it's a self-contained procedure. Three sailing balls too. And then show off with it. Everyone should admire their house. "Look how nice we are." They paid 20 million Swedish crowns! Just for the view. The kitchen doesn't fit here. Then all the explosives that are lying on the boardwalk. - That's not nice. - Is it theirs? - What else? Esker's? - Do you know it's theirs? - Good morning. - Hi. How are you? - Fine. How about you? - Just great. We're looking forward to the party tonight. We do too. Guys, you guys have done a fantastic job with the house. Ready on time. I'm your fan. I'm really impressed. The latest invoice hasn't been paid. I have to pay the guys. Sorry, I thought I had ... I've been out traveling. But I'll fix it. Well, the neighbor here was talking about the landing stage and sauna. They lie om my property. He's only alive to make people's life miserable. They are on my property. It's really a good job. Well done everyone! - Do you have to stand here all day? - I'll talk to him tonight. - Is that really a good opportunity? - Yes! The forest is being destroyed by the quad bikes going to that house. And the landing stage is partly located on our property. Are we really going to the party tonight? Of course.  Everything that's for free is good. I met her down there at the bakery. She ordered a lot of bread and cakes and spoke English. She seemed a bit snotty. Let's take a closer look on that shit.. - Totally amazing. - Thanks. - Linda? - Yes. - Where shall I put these? - Just put each one on table. - Yes, yes, yes. Do not skimp on the spirits. - No. Can I test that? I'm a pro at this. My father always said: "I fear a a man who drinks water all evening," "and is remembering what everyone said." Have you seen my brown belt, honey? In there. In the bakery today they didn't  know that I understand Swedish. They'll be embarrassed when they realize it. However I looked a little "shaby". No, "shabby" is the word,  which isn't true by the way.  But I have this feeling  that nobody likes us here. It's because they don't. Simple enough. - But I'm right. - Of course. But do you know what?  We'll have a fantastic party and they realize that we are quite ordinary people who'll bleed if stabbed  and will die if poisoned. Okay, Shakespeare. - Do you really think so? - Yes. Don't you? Mmm... I hope you're right. Love, trust me. Just a little. - Carsten? - Yes. Please, make it right this time. Come on. Take what you want in the kitchen then,  but don't leave Simon and Alma alone. - I promise. When are you coming home? - We won't be so late. When it getting too late, then we go home. - Okay? - Okay. Why do you go to a party if you don't feel like it? - llike to take a look. - You're just curious. - Yes. Have fun, girls. - The same. - See you then, darlings. - Bye Mom. Here comes the beer, guys. Cheers. Jee, this is really getting nice. Yes, there are only a few slats left. By the way, it was the municipality I heard it from. You haven't asked for wardship from beach protection... Damn, I'm getting tired of those Municipality bosses... - You'll have to pay us! - Take it easy! I'll take care of this. Have a nice time. That was the bank. Somebody has made a mistake. Again. - But they promised that the money will be on its way now. - Okay? - I have to take this. Okay? - Have a nice party, then. 118a 00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:43,960 - Thanks. - Bye. All right. - We want our money - What? 119a 00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,760 You heard me.  The time is out. Deadline was yesterday. No... no, no, no, no it's absurd. - Sir, I need a week. - No, today. Now. Where can we meet? To meet you? Not today. I have a party. Today it's impossible . Carsten? You make it, darling ? Yes, I'm coming. Why don't you reply to my letters? It's a party. We'll talk about it another day. It's only something little.  It is part of Sandhamn's history. Thanks. Do you live here all year? No no. We are not residents. We live on a former farm here and work in town. - What is your job? - I'm a lawyer. Okay. Then you and me should learn to know each other. I have problems with half the island,  anyway so it feels like. But you might write on the list. The list? - It' an action group: "No to the shrapnel at Fyrudden." - No.  We didn't sign it. Really we didn't. - Champagne? - Oh yes, please. - Here you are. Feel yourself at home. - Thanks so much. - Have you been inside and did take a look? - Not yet. In any case they have not saved at all.  There is marble in all bathrooms, starfish patterns on the floor... and then the food... They have set up fences right down along the beach? I usually walk there, but now you probably won't get past. They think they own everything. - Hey! - Hi. My name is Carsten, for anyone who doesn't know yet. And my name is Celia. Let me start by saying that we are very happy and grateful about having you all here tonight. We actually live in London, but we are in Sweden during summertime. We have been looking like madmen for somewhere to spend the summers. When we found out that the plot here on Lighthouse was for sale, we struck. I think we both know that we have found the perfect place for us, and now it's finally done. It has taken some time to finish this little skyscraper. So, that's just it. The doors are open. I hope to see many of you here this summer even when we have no party. Visit us. Anytime. But now it's party time. So ... I don't need it, but anyway serve yourself, drink, enjoy, and have as nice time if you like. - We have still a long evening. Cheers! - Cheers! No. You have to look a little further. He should be ashamed. Someone should tell him. - It's selfish and unsolidary. - I told you we wouldn't go here. - You said that, yes. - Yes I did. The provision for discrete construction the island has landed. Now there is someone in the municipality who has taken a huge advantage. You can write that down. They won't do anything. - But we must think of something then. - Don't you think I've tried? - Is everything okay?  - Thanks. Bastard. "Icke Picke Pö lived on an island" "The island began to burn and everyone started running," "except for Icke Picke Pö because he was already dead." - Please come back any time. - We are happy to do so. Many thanks to you too. 174a 00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:58,620 - Good night. - So long. Excuse me, Madam. Carsten Jonsson your husband, right? Perhaps you know where I can find him? He's here somewhere. I haven't seen him for a while. I'll find him. Thank you. Nice... house. It's the ugliest building I have seen in my whole life. Boastful, that's what it is. Have you seen the landing stage and sauna? They lie on my plot. My land. But he shits on everyone, that bastard. PärAnders? - Now we go home. - I want to talk to Carsten first. - You know what... - He should know. PärAnders! Carsten! Carsten! Linda. Have you seen my husband? He has gone to bed, I think. That would be the first time. - You have something in your eye. - What? Have I? Yes! Do it again. Good. Now we go home. Finally. Thanks a lot for tonight. - Thank you very much for wonderful party. - Good night. 195a 00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,600 - Good night. - Good night. Oh, eh...I wish you all the best and thank Carsten as well. I couldn't find him, so... How many glasses of champagne did you really drink? Many. Would you consider to live in such a house? - No. - I won't either. - Did you have fun? - Having fun is all right, but... - but you seemed happy. - Yes. I love dancing. It was really fun. - Dancing is nothing but the overture to... - Sex? You usually say that, but it must apply only to you. Oh my God. - Yes? - Too much champagne, I think. You ... shouldn't we dance a little here? No, I want to snuggle. I want to sleep. Can't we sleep? It's burning at Fyrudden. What the hell. Call the fire brigade. It's Thomas. He has marked the center of the wall. Away from that the corner. - Over there too? - Yes. Okay. Good. Thanks. - It actually smells of burnt chicken. - I know. Theo thinks the fire accellarator was a fluid. - Theo? - The dog. The arsonist put it in several places. Flammable liquid. Gasoline or lighter fluid. This lighter was found outside the sauna. There was a broken champagne glass in there as well. Okay. We get to talk to the homeowner. I have to apologize that my husband is not here. - Where is he? - Please, speak Swedish. I understand . I haven't seen Carsten since last night. To be quite honest I have no idea where he is. - Have you tried to call him? - Yes. His mobile is in the office. Why do you ask? We have found a body in the sauna, but we don't know who it is yet. Isn't not... isn't not Carsten, isn't it? Please, tell me. We don't know that until we have examined the body. But how long will that take? It takes a little time, but let's not think the worst. Would you like to answer some questions? When did you last see him? Ten last night. Do you remember anything during the party? Take your time. There was this man, eh...  Russian, I think. He had this accent. What did he want? He wanted to know where Carsten was. But I didn't know. I would need a list of all guests who were here and also from the staff. - How was the party? - I do not really know. I didn't know anyone there and Oliver and Sara were pretty tired, so we got ready early and went. How did Carsten work? Did you see where he went? No, I didn't. But... I think he was pretty drunk. - Do you like it here? Beeing in the family? - Yes. The kids are really nice and cute. And Celia and Carsten? Carsten travels quite a lot, so he's not home that often. But he is kind and nice. - So you like him? - Yes. - Did you find out anything? - No. The sauna has burned to the ground. There is almost only ashes left. - I hope they'll feel really shitty about it! - Are you sure nobody was there when it burned? How should I know? There were cops all running around. - I didn't dare to approach them so close. - But we haven't done anything. No. We were at a party. You got drunk and  we went home. End of discussion. Exactly. End of discussion. Excuse me. - Are you from the police? - Yes. - Is it true that the barn was on fire? - Who are you? Linda Öberg.  I'm responsible for the catering here. Thomas Andreasson. So you were here all night? - Yes. - Did you notice anything at the party? No. I was in the kitchen all evening and then we cleaned. - What time were you finished? - Late. When we were done with serving, I said hello to Celia and then I took the boat and went home. - Where is home? - I have a house on Runmarö. If you think of something, so can you please contact us? - Of course. - Great. Thanks. Yes, there was something. There was a note. It said: "Get out of here!" How do you mean? When we were setting up the party tent we discovered black, dead birds,  cormorants, hanging on the rod of the roof. Mom! Wake up! Now! Thomas is here! - What if the fire had spread? - Yes... Thanks. - We found a body in the sauna. - What? We don't know who it is, but we think it's a man. - Did something happen at the party? Any trouble? - No. - How was Carsten at the party? - I think he was pretty filled up. I saw him leave with some young, blond girl. Do you know when? Something else? Nobody likes Carsten Jonsson actually. He lives next door to Sandhamn's worst querulant. PärAnders Andersson. He started a protest list against Jonsson's house building. He is the one who spread the most shit about him. - Excuse me. - Who are you? Thomas Andreasson. Are you PärAnders Andersson? I haven't done anything illegal. I just want to ask some questions. Is it going well? "Carsten Jonsson can take all his money and go to hell. " "He'll stop manipulating  the property of his neighbors, "if he understands what's best for him." Do you recognize that? - I was a pretty drunk. - Though that sounds pretty threatening. That was stupid. I should have expressed me in a different way. But the sauna and the landing stage are located too close. They can almost look straight into your house. No fences are needed on this island. We all know who lives here. - When did you come home from the party? - At midnight. - What did you do then? - Why? These are just routine questions. We went to bed and slept. Anna can confirm that. - Do we really believe in a pyromaniac? - No. But PärAnders Andersson has a motive. He and his wife have signed the petition. Not just that. He has reported it just before summer began. It counts10 pages about Carsten Jonsson who had built a landing stage in his water. - Can you even own water? - Of course you can. - It's moving. - You own the plot underwater. Yes, yes. According to the Building Committee there are there several reports against Jonsson. Some one about moonlighter, another about unauthorized chopping wood. But all these notifications are anonymous. - What's it about you islanders? - Why? There is a fucking lot of noise and intrigue. You have to belong to the 13th  generation to be accepted. - That's how it is. It's in the blood. - Inbreeding! I've been chasing the forensic doctor for that. Obtaining an autopsy protocol. You were right. It was a man, between thirty and 40 years old. He got a powerful blow on the back of his head. He died of smoke poisoning and  was heavily affected then. 330 00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,240äüö  In addition, there were traces of cocaine. It's not entirely unthinkable that Carsten used cocaine. He has been away for a day. The only person that's been reported missing. Then it's probably him. Do we know how he disappeared? He left the party with some blonde girl but we don't know who she is. We didn't want to torment  the wife yet with that fact. She is not feeling well. Here we have a possible motive. Jealousy. - Film those who are watching. - Okay. - I've changed my flight to Copenhagen today. - Really? - I'm going to Mallis instead. - Oh. Wouldn't you just work all day? Yes, but Vera wanted to come along for something and then I thought ... - How long will you be away then? - Just a few extra days . But I thought we were going to borrow  Henry's boat for going on a mini vacation. I know, but it will be still there. Right? Yes Yes. Do it. Mallis is okay. It's good for you. But not for me, maybe. - Why do you say that? Are you angry now? - No, I'm not mad. Mother! You have a visitor. Thomas is here. - You can almost thinkthat he's living here. - I'm Coming! Do you recognize anyone? This guy for example. Yes, that's Granlund's son. Why? - Nora. Have you seen my mobile charger? - No. Ask Vera. - Vera? - Do you think he burned down the sauna? We have to go now if we want to catch the ferry. - Are you going to town? - No. It's just them. Anton is his name. It's Olle Granlund's son. You've met him. Do you remember him? He is a former coastal hunter. - Right. - We really have to go now. - Contact me if you need more help. - Thanks. I'll call you tonight. - Hi, Vera. - Bye. Have a good time at Mallis. - I'll call you back. - You said that. Right. - Hi there, the police. - Servant, Granlund. - If you want toobtain some have fish? We have a whit today. - Looks good. No thanks. I'd talk to your son. Anton. Anton! There is someone who wants to talk to you. Are you coming down? He doesn't want to, he doesn't want to. What happened? Someone had set fire to a rice pile. I saw Anton there and wonders if he has seen anything. Has it something to do with the fire at Jonsson's? We do not know. Perhaps. But Anton doesn't set fire to houses. No. Anton! Are you coming down? Or should I come up? It was me. - What did you do? - I lit it. - The sauna? - No. The grass on the beach. - You like fire? - Yes. - Did you see when the sauna was burning? - Yes. - Did you see who did it? - It was already in flames when I arrived. - But someone went off in a boat. - Who? A man or a woman? Can you describe the boat? - What did it look like? - It was small and white. Carsten! I thought you were dead. Okay Love. It's okay. {\an8}Machine translation from Swedish,  correction and editing by: Desertkid.  Where the fuck have you been? I was...
