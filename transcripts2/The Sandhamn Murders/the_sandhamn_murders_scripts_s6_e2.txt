 Isn't that strange? Has anyone been murdered? No, is it you who picks up gas from  the boats with a hose during nighttime? Who is that? Pontus Lindqvist. He came up in the pedophile heritage in Gothenburg. Now free as a bird. You can't call home as soon as it gets a little hard. No. It's best if he learns to solve his problems himself. 7a 00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:44,000 Machine translation from Swedish,  correction and editing by: Desertkid. Everybody who ate a lot of sweets, makes  sure brushing their teeth properly. Okay? Is this how it should be? Huh? What is it that you want? I don't get it. Calm down. I hear what you're saying, Thomas. But you must try to understand how I feel. - Okay? - I'll try.

 Good. I honestly don't know if it's a good idea right now that we... - Hello? Are you still there, right? - I have to hang up now. - 4712 to 3560, come. - 3560, come. We have visitors. Police! Put that down! Put that down! Don't move! 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20... Is somebody missing anyone? Benjamin is not here. Benjamin? Okay. Eh... everyone has to wait.  Nobody's sailing until Benjamin is here. Benjamin? You haven't seen Benjamin? The little shy guy. No.

 Maja! Maja! A kid is missing! Benjamin Wallin's gone.  I can't find him. Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin ? Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin! Maja! Maja! Maja! You can go to the Knarrholmen's sailing camps. A boy has disappeared. - What's his name? - Benjamin Wallin. Children and deep water aren't a good combination. - Have you talked to Waxholm's copartnership? - Yes, but nothing. No boats are missing at Knarrholmen. If he escaped, he must have been swimming. - How old is he? - Twelve. I contacted the parents and the naval police are waiting for you at Stavsnäs. Something vegetarian. I'm a little tired of meat. Meat tires a person. Vegetarian is okay as long as you keep an  eye on the boys when they are resting. Mm. I'm going back to work now. Okay. This is totally sick. I don't get it. Benjamin lived in the Star. It's one of your guys. Who did this? I have no clue. Okay. We need to get started to hear the children. Now. I'll call for reinforcement. What happened? One child has disappeared. Benjamin Wallin. Do you know him? I think so. I saw him and his Dad when I left Simon. - The blonde with... - Yes. We have been looking around the whole island. - We'll have to do it over again. - My God, this is so terrible. I's the worst thing that can happen. Where is Simon? - He's inside with Mia. - Okay. Did any of you see or hear something  during the night or the morning? Something that seemed cosy. I was on the run before waking up, but I saw nothing strange. Nothing I can think of anyway. Who do you think has hung the doll? Could it be anyone here from the camp? What you say to me, is purely confidential. That's how it is. There are some who are quite wicked towards Benjamin. Who? Sebbe and Samuel. In what way then, foolish? They hid his life jacket and then Benjamin was scolded by Isaac. At dinner Samuel showed off that it was him who had hidden it. He thought it was fucking fun. Yesterday they left him in the woods. Although he had been pushed into the water. What then? Did they just leave him? Yes. It was luck that that old man came. Which guy? We have given back the cell phones now. If they don't find him soon, everyone can take their children home today. Hey, my boy. I want to talk to two guys who live at the Star. Sebbe and Samuel. Okay. I ask Isaac to take care of it. Simon will have to talk with Thomas too. - Okay. Then I go and pack. - Come on. Thomas. I met him in Sandhamn before we went here. The same guy helped Benjamin when he was soaking wet. Then I met him yesterday as well on the quiz. His boat was laying there. - I talked to him. - Okay. Wait here. Excuse me. Yes? Hi. I need to know who has been here the last few days. Okay. We have lists. Email the entire list when  you're still on the move. - I'll send it at once. - Thanks. - This is Benjamin, isn't it? - Yes. But it is an old picture. - I have a newer one if you want. - Of course. So here. - Can you send it to me? - Certainly. How did Benjamin work yesterday? - He did okay. - Yes. You sleep in the same house? And you, Samuel, sleeping in the same bunk bed? - Benjamin was under you? - Yes. And? You should have noticed if he disappeared during the night. Or at least that he was gone in the morning. I'm not his mother. He wasn't there in the morning. Not that I noticed anyway. You sail the same boat and sleeps close to each other. You don't observe each other then? He was there when Isaac went out, but... that's kind of all I know. I know you bullied Benjamin. We will probably find traces of you on the doll you hung up in the forest. Samuel. You hid his life jacket, so he got a scolding. Yesterday you left him alone while he  was really soaked and that in a place as far away as you can get on this island. Though you were supposed to stick  together if you are in the same team. How did he end up in the water? You don't leave this room before  you have told everything you know and what you did to Benjamin. So you forced him into the water? Yes... And tossed in all his clothes? Yes. What are you saying, Samuel? Mm. I'm not done with you two. But now I need to know if any of you saw him after  the lamp went out yesterday. No. All we know is that he was there when Isaac went out. I swear. I know nothing more. What if he drowned? The police are here now. They look everywhere. They'll find him soon. He can't just be gone. How can one lose a child? We took fit or granted that you took the responsibility for him. How the hell can one run  activities where children disappear? Hi. Thomas Andreasson. I'm the leader of the search group. - Have you found anything? - Not yet. But lost children have the highest priority. All staff members are coming  forwards to help with the search. He can't just disappear. What if someone has taken him? Simon! Wait. - Do you recognize this man? - Yes. That's him. The one with the boat. Margit has called Farsta. They have an  eye on his apartment around the clock. What do you think of a helicopter? A blue and white motor boat of unknown brand in the southern archipelago. In the middle of the holiday. It's like a needle in a haystack. What the hell are we doing? We have no other choice than going out  and showing around a picture ot his Lindqvist. - Do you contact the prosecutor? - Okay. And how about Benjamin then? Shall we go around with a picture of him too? Not until we've talked with his parents. - I managed to get them returned home. - Good. I can handle that. Thanks. Take the boat in, then we'll see you in the office tomorrow. Okay. And you... give Elin a hug from me. Hello Thomas. How's it going? We go out with names and pictures from Lindqvist and Benjamin. Okay. Good. We received tips that Lindqvist has  been seen in Umeå, Arvika, Falkenberg, Tomelilla in Skåne and one tip came from Oskarshamn. It's probably the only reasonable thing to do, but it will lead hardly to anything.  The Police Department is in full control of his apartment. It's empty. The hall floor is covered with mail, so he has not been there for a while. But they still observe the  project around the clock. And no trace of Benjamin. I'm sure he stays on the lake. If only we knew what kind of boat he has. I've called all the boat clubs between Arholma and Landsort. No one has Pontus Lindqvist registered. He may have rented a private dock. I can check that out. I'll keep calling around. Hello? I know. That's fucking bad. I can't talk now. The line has to be free in case they call. Okay. I'll call you, Mom. Bye. When I get that bastard... I'll kill him. I saw the pictures online. Damn it. Simon met him twice. - Yes. But he is at home now? - Yes. Everything's cool. He is at home. So damn terrible. Poor parents. It's a nightmare. And you managed to be in the middle of it. I want you to come home now. It's a little late to do some good, maybe. Not at all. It smells like dead beaver in the basement and I can't fix it. Make an update on the boats  from the guest in the harbor as well. Take fingerprints from Benjamin's headboard and window sill. Find out more about Pontus Emanuel Lindqvist.  Here is his file. Horrible to read! Thomas. I think I have found him in the Dalarö Boat Club. Come on now. Lindqvist had an alias online: Emanuel Glans. This was stated in the report from Gothenburg. It was worth a try. - Glans has a boat seat on Dalarö? - Yes. We're lucky the boat is there. If Lindqvist is there we'll be crazy lucky. If Benjamin is there... If Lindqvist's boat is here,  it should be on the right. Location 76. At least we have some luck. Police! Pontus Lindqvist! Damn. It's the wrong bridge. Pontus! Stay! I'm going the other way. Stay! Stay! Take your hands behind your head. Down on the ground. Down on the ground! All the way down. Hands on your head. We need the technichans here too. Thanks. Where is Benjamin? Hello. I asked you one thing. Where is Benjamin? - Are you still there?  - I'm on my way. Check this out. - Do you see that one? It's his dad. - No. - Yes. He' should be on his way home. Cool huh? - Yes. - I'm leaving now. See you later. - Have a good time. - Hi. - Hi. How is it? - It's okay. - I wanted to visit you but it's been so dreadfull... You may have heard. I saw it on the news this morning. Awful. - How's the writing? - Yes, it's going well. - Well, that's great. - Mm. I wanted to ask if I can  borrow some milk from you. - Yes. Hang in there. - Thanks. Yes... but we stay home. Yes. Okay. Then I know. What did they say? - They have arrested that Lindqvist. - Did they find Benjamin? - What? - Benjamin? They found his sweater on his boat. So you're not going to answer that either? He has had more than 24 hours  to travel from Sandhamn to Dalarö. He has had plenty of time to  make a stop somewhere. Yes. I think like you. Benjamin can be  locked up in a cottage on some island. Without food and water. Or he has killed him and left the body somewhere behind. - Can anyone get me a glass of water? - Certainly. Here are pictures from his camera. They are from your camera. Mm. I take some pictures sometimes. It is not illegal as far as I know. Can you explain why Benjamin's  sweater was on your boat? Benjamin? His name is Benjamin? I think I found it in the forest. Say where he is, you piece of fucking shit! It takes three hours from Sandhamn to Dalarö. Where did you go last night? Say where he is, otherwise  I will beat the shit out of you! Let go! Everyone is aware that we must find him as soon as possible. But right now you aren't of much help. I called two interrogators from Kungsholmen. You go home. Now. Good luck. I don't know, Christian. But  sending Benjamin to this camp... He didn't want to. Do we have to talk about this now? All of a sudden hell broke loose here, because  you definitely wanted him to go to that camp. The last thing he said was  that he didn't want to go there. He didn't want to go there. Do you mean seriously that this is my fault? I couldn't control myself. - Unprofessional. - It's not that strange... in such a situation. Like you said, it's hard when it's a kid. It's too much at once. I feel as if I'm the world's worst dad. No, now you must learn to let go. You're a good dad. In this situation I have to be there for Pernilla. Mia. You have to take a look at this. Apparently a guy in the guest  harbor at Knarrholmen had a surveillance camera on his boat. Look. Pontus Lindqvist. He's alone. Two minutes later he leaves. Ten minutes later. Watch now. - Is that Benjamin? - Yes. Watch now. - Who's boat is that? - I haven't the faintest idea. But anyway Pontus Lindqvist isn't involved. Do you understand? He volunteered. Voluntarily? But... It's impossible to be sure, but we'll see the movie again tomorrow. What a nightmare. - Who was it? - I don't know. Well, probably some newspaper. I don't want to talk to them. He's not answering. - What the hell, Niklas! - I want to hear how it is. - Why are you calling now? - You know damn well what happened. - I know, but I wanted to hear... - You call from the office. - What are you doing there? - I wonder about Benjamin. - You don't touch the papers. - After all, they are quite open here. The letter from the municipality has been here for several days. I've been waiting for you to say something.  You don't say a word. Don't touch the paper. I'm going through Hell on Earth right now. I don't know if Benjamin is alive. It may not be that strange. - What? -If you are obviously lying to me. - What, then, "strange"? - What do you mean by that? Nothing. I want my money. I want my money! Damn! One can turn it around and around, it still remains a failure. You can choose not to see it as a failure. That's my tenant. - Isn't Elin a failure? - No no no. You know what I mean. Yes, I know that. You just might need it to be apart for some time. Or you need help. Then you can look for someone and talk. I feel pretty drained.  We have to do what's best for Elin. Then you have to be able to talk to each other. It is much simpler talking to you. But... it'	1qs burglary, right? Niklas! Niklas! Benjamin? Benjamin? What are you doing here? What the hell have you done? What are you doing here? Where did you leave him? Where is he? Is he somewhere here? I'll give it to you, damn it! What the hell are you doing? What? You bastard! Where is he? What have you done to him? Benjamin? I'm from the police. Stay here. Okay? - Hi, Benjamin. Are you okay? - Yes. My name is Nora. I don't know if you remember me. I'm Simon's mom. Hello? Benjamin? My name is Thomas Andreasson. I am from the police. Explain it to me. He broke up with you and you kidnapped his son? No, I didn't. It was Benjamin who called me. I just helped him. I just saved him from those fucking psychopathic bitches. He tried to call home. He really tried to call home several times, but they didn't answer. But you could have called? I did! I called Christian many times, however he didn't answer. He just pushed me away. You could have called Åsa. And then... we hadn't the intention that it became like this. We didn't want this situation! Hello. Hi, it's Thomas Andreasson from the police. We've found Benjamin. - How is he? - Everything is all right. He's at Sandhamn. We make sure that he comes home as soon as possible. He is here. You have to talk to him. It's your dad. Hi Dad. It's me. - Jee, what a pity. - That's the right word. I don't understand the way of her thinking. She would kidnap his children in the assumption that he would leave his wife for her? I don't think she thought at all. She just wanted to punish him. Yes, yes. Benjamin seemed to be okay. When it comes to the abuse of Niklas Grönros you better get a solicitor. But we can talk abaout that later. First we want that everything around  Benjamin is clear. We have to hear his story. Please, you can come with me. Hello Thomas. Come here, and you'll see. - Hi, Claire. - I have started a new life. I realize I've taken advantage of you. Certainly others too for that matter... This one for example. Now I've filled it so now it goes back to its rightful owner. Thanks. Have you missed this one? Yes. I thought it was gone. It was a long time ago. Yes. You can't borrow a lot things without giving them back. - No. - Now it will be order. Not the same brand, but it's red. - You like that? - Oh, yes. That's for sure. This wok is definitely not mine. You can prepare some chicken dish with it which tastes very well. It might fit with red wine too. Hey! - Hi. - Hi. - Wow! I have sticky fingers. - It doesn't matter. Ehm... I have thought clearly.
