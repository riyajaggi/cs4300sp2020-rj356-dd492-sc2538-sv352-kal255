 [birdsong] If you're not gonna wake up, I'm making pancakes. [Niko and Erik sigh] [Niko] She gets that from you. [Erik] That willfulness? No, that's pure Breckinridge. [Niko groans] I'm up. -I gotta go over a lecture, anyway. -What do you say we call in sick and rendezvous back here? [both laughing] -[alarm blares] -[Niko gasps] [sniffs] Is that--

 [computer] Smoke detected in kitchen. -Oh, shit. -Pancakes! -Jana! Hold on there, buddy. -Smoke detected. -[Jana giggling] Okay, you... [giggles] Here we go. [both chuckling] Your daughter has you wrapped around her pinky. [chuckles] [Erik] Yes, she does. All right, there you go. Don't forget the maple syrup. -[Jana laughs] -Hey, Jana? -What? -Eat your breakfast, please.

 -Eat. -[Erik] Okay. Hey, were you serious about playing hooky? Yeah. [whirring] [chiming] What happened to my cartoon? [woman] This... is Harper Glass. This is it, people. A UFO. An honest to God unidentified flying object just... -dropped out of the sky. -Mommy? -Sh, baby. -I've got followers all across the country -saying they saw it. -Oh... Six minutes ago, somebody saw it... -...over Rochester, New York. -...my God. -Five minutes later, Kansas City-- -I-- I don't like it. -Hey. -...Jackson, Wyoming... -It's okay, honey. -...now Washington State. Hold on, I'm getting a report. Let me put it up. [screaming] [Harper] That's it. That is what I saw. This is not a hoax. I repeat. This is not a hoax. -Are these seizures? Muscle spasms? -I-- We're gonna lose her. [whirring] [gasping] [choking] [groaning] It's not a stroke. There's no history of epilepsy. -There's nothing in her charts. -[Petra wheezing] That planet? Could we have brought something back that was contagious? -[Bernie] What's that? -[mumbling] We-- We can't hear you. -[Zayn] Oh, my God. -[bleep] Please throw me out an airlock. [sobs] You have to throw me-- [groaning and choking] Niko! [sobbing] Please-- [screaming] Please! Please! [gasping sobs] If this was a virus or... or some kind of bacteria, wouldn't we be showing symptoms? If someone sneezes on you, it doesn't mean you automatically catch a cold. [whirring] Okay, Petra is stabilized, -so we-- -Nuh-uh. Stop right there, farm boy! You can go ahead and back right the fuck on up. -Michelle-- -No. Hell, no. That evil little parasite got dragged in with his goddamn soil samples. Oh, no, my soil samples were sterilized. All of them. -Stop talking. You're breathing it on us. -No, I'm not! Okay, enough! Petra's blood and urine came back clean. Which makes sense. She didn't even step foot on that planet. So it's not a virus, then? It's not communicable? Well, the only thing that was wonky were her stress hormones which were all elevated. No shit, she was stressed. She was flopping on the floor like a fish. All right, we have other fires we need to put out. -Where are we with comms? -As screwed as we were yesterday. Same goes for long-range navigation. So, we're lost and we can't even tell anybody? -Awesome. -[William appears] We're not completely lost. We have one reference point. Sirius A. Backtrack, reorient. Find our original course. -Do it. -Done. August, get somatic back up and running. Take Oliver. Cas, we'll see what we can do with the FTL drive. Javier? -See if you can help Michelle with comms. -I don't need help. Are they working? Look, I know you're all on edge right now and I am right there with you, but that is no reason to panic. We need to stay focused on the things that we have control over. Right now, it's getting back on course. Uh, ah... What can I do to help? 'Cause I'm not entirely useless. Get people coffee, keep 'em fed. To think we could have brought 160 pounds of toilet paper instead. -[hissing] -Oh. [low rumbling] God, it's like a furnace in here. Something must be overheating. Well, it's a clue, at least. Let's check the cooling systems first. [device squeaking] [bleeping] [sighs] Petra will be okay. Just can't think about it too much. Right. Absolutely, yeah. [whirring] [rhythmic, deep whirring] [panting] Cas, can you come up here and shine a light? Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Thanks. Just... Okay. -[crunching] -[yelps] [whimpers] Motherfucker! God... damn! Fuck! Niko, you haven't slept for days. Why don't you take a break? When, Cas? When do I take a break? Before I shoot Petra out of an airlock? Or after I map an entire quadrant of the fucking galaxy we were never supposed to be in in the first place? -Sorry. -Ah, it's okay. We are just... fucked! Yerxa fucked us. He literally fucked us. [sighs] [sighs] Maybe I read him wrong, I don't know. I think maybe he read you wrong. How's that? 'Cause if he'd known what you were really made of, on the inside? [grunts] How you'd do anything for this mission? He would have known you'd kill him. There's this guy back on Earth. Oh, yeah? I must have had a crush on him since middle school. So, like, what, a week ago? [chuckles] Pretty much. Anyway... a few days before we left, he reached out, out of nowhere. Asked if I wanted to get frozen yogurt. To profess his undying love? We could have been soulmates. Maybe... settled down one day. A few kids. Now, I'll never know. A few kids, huh? -How many are we talking? -Maybe four or five? I always wanted a big, crazy family. Yeah, so that way it would never get boring, you know? [chuckles] You and... uh... [sighs] Uh, Melissa? Melissa. How did you guys leave things? A little too early for the kid talk, you know? But you must have been... pretty sad to say goodbye? Nothing's really changed for us. Our thing has always been, um... long-distance. Except for the you might never come back part. I mean, is she waiting for you? Are you guys open? You know, it's... it's gotta... it's gotta be the cooling system. It's more than just a climate control issue. [birdsong] Are you fucking kidding me? My daughter heard about her mom from your site. I'm sorry, but I'm glad I got your attention. I don't want your apology. Fair. Won't happen again. We're on the same side. [laughs] Here it comes. I'm not who you think I am, Erik. The second I have anything concrete about Niko or the Salvare, you'd be the first to know. -Pretty sure I'd know before you. -For how long? Dubois tell you about her list of replacements for you? You're on borrowed time, Erik. If you hadn't played Name That Tune with the Artifact... My site isn't the most popular news source in the world because of the crossword puzzles. I can keep you ahead of Dubois. You keep me informed and I'll keep you informed. My work's classified, so I don't share that with anyone. So, you're just gonna leave Niko out there alone because you're not willing to risk your integrity? Yeah. -[thumping] -[gasps] -[loud rumbling] -[gasps] Aah! [alarm blaring] [sighs] What the hell, William? I was finally asleep. Pulling up visuals now. -[thumping] -Fuck. [sighs] [bleeping] We've entered Sirius A's version of an Oort cloud. How the fuck did we miss that? Our sensors are down. I told everyone, but did anyone listen? Nah. -Without sensors-- -Right, my eyes will have to do. Open the Crow's Nest. Everyone strap in. [grinding and clanking] -[bleeping] -[panting] That one was a bit close. Fuck, I didn't even see that. [crashing and rumbling] [exhales] -Yeah... -There's another cluster ahead. -Fuck. Cas, come take over? -What? -Just come take over. -Yeah. What's goin' on? [gasping] Niko, what's goin' on? You with me? [gasps] I can't see. [rocks crashing] -Headaches? -No. No, there were some black spots earlier, -but I thought it was just eye strain. -Are you feeling dizzy or irritable-- Are you fucking kidding me? This isn't psychosomatic. No, I didn't say it was. [rapid bleeping] Your stress hormones are off the charts. It could be a lack of sleep or... -more likely-- -I've got what Petra's got... only I'm blind. I thought you tested her. I-- I thought her blood was clean. She is. You both are. But I'm not an astrobiologist. So, wake one up. [Bernie] Okay, Julian, the hydrogen peroxide was boiled and electrolyzed and the soil samples went through a UV bath light and a chemical wash. -All per procedure. -[sighs] All right, come on in. I'm presentable. Like, soil samples? Tell me the chemical composition. Nothing unusual. Calcium, phosphorus, a little boron. A little boron? Bernie, did you even take basic astrobiology? 'Cause if you did, you'd remember that boron, under the right circumstances, that can provide the basic building blocks of life. Um, none of my tests would have caught a boron-based virus. It's okay. You couldn't have known. [Julian] No, he could have... but he didn't. [Cas] Smooth sailing, Niko, but we're still 28 hours out. Sirius B is only now coming into view. -[thud] -[gasps] How are you doin'? I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Just work on setting a course. How are we coming with nav? Oh, I fixed it. Didn't I mention that? I pulled a whole new operating system out of my ass. Just like that, ready to go. Uh, we managed to recover some garbled transmissions from Earth. There's, uh... there's one there for you. All right, well, send it on through when you get a chance. You all know where to find me. [sighs deeply] "We... We... managed to--" What did "we" manage to do? Exactly what did you do, Javier? Oh, you helped? [chuckles] He helped. Great. Everybody gets a fucking ribbon. -[laughs] -Okay. I don't need your help sending a goddamn email. -Michelle? -What? We're all gonna die. You realize that, right? First Petra gets sick, now Niko. Who's next? Go get some air. Now. If soma comes back up, can we put her down first? -Shit. -[Jana] Ready? See? See? [laughs] Pretty good, huh? Parma at school taught me. You don't know Parma. I met her after you left. Her after you left. -Stop transmission. Stop! -Her after you left. Her after you left. -Her after you left. Her after you left. -William? -Her after you left. -Oh! [sighs] Thank you. Are you still there? I am. It's hard to tell. I've... fixed the glitch on the video. [sighs] Can you tell me what's happening? Sure, I can do that. [Jana] You'll meet her when you come back from space. Oh! And we also made up this totally new move called the wormhole. Watch. -Jana's... -Okay. One, two... -...running down the lawn. -Whoo-hoo! -Okay. One, two, three... -Now she's kneeling. One, two, three... [giggling] -Doing a somersault. -Whoops! [chuckles] -And another somersault. -Whoo-hoo! -And a-- -Whoops! -This kid really likes her somersaults. -[laughs] Fun. [Jana laughs] And it looks as if we're heading for a big finale. And... it's... a handstand. Oh, right. Doing it... Steady... and she's down. Did you like it, Mommy? I've been practicing it a lot. -It took me forever to figure out... -Thank you. There's still loads more. -...not fall over. -You can turn it off, please. I can't wait to show you for real-- [clears throat] You're gonna get your sight back. You'll see her again, and not just on a holo-transmission. I know it. You don't know that. Call if you need me. Julian? A word, please. We can walk and talk at the same time, I'm assuming. -Yeah. -What is it? Earlier, in the lab, I was watching you work. You're heating the sample up a tad too quickly. I was? And you know this how? 'Cause I spent my childhood inoculating baby chicks against the Zambian flu. You grew up in a petting zoo? No, man, I grew up on the largest farm in Northern Iowa. Northern Iowa? Wow. [scoffs] Fucking... Out of all the people we could have woken up... You got the best guy for the job. Had they woken me up before you, I'd have made sure decontamination rules -were actually followed. -Hey, hey, hey. They were followed... to the best of my abilities. -Yeah. -You know what, Julian? While you've been asleep, I've been through the following. Mutiny, the ship spinning like a merry-go-round, a very public electrocution-slash-execution that left a very distinct smell of burnt hair and flesh, floating though the ship, crash landing on a rogue planet and a freakin' volcanic eruption. So I'm sorry if I didn't realize that life could be boron-based and that that life could evade our best contamination efforts. -Mm-hm. -And-- -You're unbelievable, you know that? -Bernie?  Can this please wait until after I've told everyone that I've isolated the virus that's infecting this crew? Or is this more important? [humming] [door opens] Hello? Hello, who's there? Hello? Hah! -You're the real virus on this ship, Niko. -What are you doing? -You. -[gasping] -[yells] -[grunts] You're not thinking clearly, Michelle. Don't you tell me what I am or am not. You don't give a fuck about me. The only person you give a rat's ass on this ship about is Cas. [screams] [groaning] [yelling] [panting] Cas ain't here to protect you now, is she? Is she? [yells] [gasping] William? Tell Zayn I have another patient. [gasping] Bernie, let me out. Bernie, let me out, okay? She wants to kill us, you know that. You know she wants to kill us. She always has. Zayn, why are you protecting her? Let me go. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it! I'll kill her. -[syringe whirrs] -Oh, yeah... The chemistry is-- It's astonishing.  The iron attaches itself to the boron as a scaffolding to form the protein chains. So these protein chains, that's what's making us sick? Well, it attacks the central nervous system. A huge spectrum of potential symptoms. With you, it's your sight, with Michelle, her amygdala's gone rabid. This is the first non carbon-based life-form ever discovered. I'm naming it Bernardium Pageius. If you're trying to get in my good books by attaching my name to some bizarro space flu... Not the way to do it. No, you're the source. Patient zero. I-- I don't have any symptoms. I isolated this from your blood. You stepped out on that rogue planet, you brought it back with you. It explains how Petra got it without ever leaving the ship. You're the carrier. Does this mean that we all have it? Those of us awake do. -The crew in soma sleep are safe. -What the hell are you doing? The virus is airborne. I was infected the moment you woke me up from soma. -[beep] -[Petra] The fuck's Julian doing awake? Are your eyeballs dry? Because mine feel like sandpaper. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look, look, look. Look where the gaps land musically. Okay, the first hits a C, G sharp's next-- -Erik-- -An augmented fifth, -then a diminished second. -You want to numeralize them? Exactly. Line them up numerically. -I tried that two days ago. -Yeah. -It didn't work. -Nothing fucking works. Sorry. It's okay. -Though the IT department might disagree. -[sighs] You and I, we're pretty fuckin' smart people, right? Why can't we crack this? We will. What aren't we seeing? It's not like they'd send us a message to baffle us. Unless, of course, they're intergalactic sadists. All right. Call up Amos. Tell him to get his ass off the field and come meet up with us. -Where are we going? -Away from this, and away from that, and off to a magical place that normal people like to call... the bar. Mm-hm. -You're fixating on word fragmentation-- -I'm fixating? -I'm not even convinced it's language-- -We must look past conventional thought-- -We kind of need to use-- -You don't know how to do that. Hey, hey, hey. We're here to drink beer, eat nachos and get heartburn. -Okay? -Less thinking, more drinking. Yes. Fine. Trivia night! Prepare to meet your doom. And on that note, I'm gonna go empty my bladder. [sighs] Oh. Jesus Christ. I swear to God, if you keep stalking me... [chuckles] I see your team is lettin' their hair down. Blowin' off some steam. [Vic] Harper! -You came, buddy! -Ha-ha! -Oh, okay. -Of course. I mean, I am a demon at trivia night. I mean, I would not miss it for the world, you know? Yeah, well, we are gonna kick some nerd ass! -[laughs] -Uh... No offense. Friends everywhere, huh? Yeah, well, knowing people is what I do. See, Vic... there? He just wants to show people he's more than just a stupid soybean farmer, and you, you wanna protect your family... and get that Artifact to talk to you. But you don't want to sacrifice your principles to do that. And you? Do you have any principles? I want the truth... and that comes before everything. [chuckles] Okay. Let's make a deal. My brains versus your brawn, and if I win, you leave me and my family alone for a whole month. And if you lose... I get a half-hour. You tell me everything you know about that... hunk of whatever it is you call it out in that field. -I mean, it's all just scientific data-- -Deal? Hm?

This is a sipping drink, by the way, -so do not knock it back, Bernie. -Mm! -[laughter] -[Zayn] Oh, God. Oh, my God, I'm so happy to see you. Do you remember anything? Like... asking me to throw you out of an airlock? If you'd done that, Zayn would have thrown you out, you know that? Uh, no. "First, do no harm." Even out in space. Here's all I remember. One minute, I'm standing there, totally fine. And the next thing I know, every nerve in my body is on fire. Pain like I've never experienced, but... now, it's like nothing ever happened. [chuckles] It's like childbirth. -Trust me, you forget that. -Yeah. Otherwise, women would have stopped having children a long time ago. Or figured out a way to make men do it. -[August] Yeah! -[laughter] And, um... you, Niko? Anything yet? Uh, no, not yet. Well, I-- I mean, if Niko's symptoms follow the same pattern as Petra's, it's only a matter of time before she regains her sight. -Yeah. Yeah. -[Oliver] Amen. Amen. Hm. Well... Um... I have a toast to make. [laughter] Uh... To space bugs. [laughter] -[chuckles] Na zdorovie! -[all] Cheers. [Oliver chuckles] Eh! You pack a punch. Like Michelle. Uh, but you leave before you outgrow your welcome. Yeah, and those things are about as welcome as a nasty bout of gonorrhea. -[Sasha] Ugh. -[Niko laughs] -Oh, that is so disgusting. -Well, I'm glad I got to meet it. [Petra] Yeah?  Tell me that when you... [laughs] When you... Okay, uh... let's get you back to the lab. I think this was a little too much, -too soon. -Are you okay? Yeah. I should have stopped at one plate. -Oh. -[Zayn sighs] Yeah. [groans] [Sasha] What's going on? [sighing] Oh, my neck. [Zayn] Don't-- Don't-- -[creaking] -[gasps] -[cracking] -[yelps] Okay. Whoa, what the fuck is that? [gasping] -Hold her arms. Hold her arms! -Will do. Guys, what's... what's going on? [groaning] -[wheezing] -[crunching] [Bernie] Oh, Jesus Christ! [Bernie screaming] Guys, can someone please tell me what the fuck is going on? [Bernie] Her nervous system is being pulled straight the fuck out of her! -[yelping] -Dear God. -[Bernie] Oh, my God! -[all gasping] -Oh! Oh, God! -[Bernie] Jesus Christ! [Sasha] Holy fuck! This virus is communicable. It's deadly and we have no idea how to stop it. Protocol is clear. We initialize a decontamination of the ship. William wakes up a new crew. First, we'll open up all the airlocks. We'll vent the infected atmosphere and contents into space. And second, the ship's fire extinguishing system will spray the interior with a liquid chemical disinfectant and destroy any remaining microbial life. [Bernie] Its "contents"? You mean us, Julian, 'cause that's what you're talkin' about here. -Mass suicide. -Bernie, this virus will kill every single one of us. -Not me. I'm resistant to this thing. -Jesus, Bernie. -He's not wrong. -I'm not talking about saving myself. I'm saying... use me. Make me your guinea pig. There has to be a cure. I did this. Let me fix it. It will take an hour to rig the system with disinfectant. So, record messages to your families, spend it with each other. Whatever you want, the time is yours. I'm sorry. I wish there was another way. Did you mean what you said? Yes, absolutely. Please. Okay. We don't know if what happened to Petra is gonna happen to you. Yes, we do. [bleeping] The antibody is based on your natural resistance. It's to trick the infected cells into committing suicide, but even if I had weeks, it could still backfire, which could, uh... could get ugly. Okay. Now what? Now we wait. [sighs] [machinery whirring] [scoffs] So this is how you choose to spend the last few minutes of your life? Could think of one or two better ways. [sighs] I figure our new crew is going to need somatic just as much as we did. -Well, thank you. I really appreciate it. -Activate soma bed five. [Salvare] Soma activated. Holy shit! You got it to work? Not just it. All of them. Uh... How? We tried everything. Well, we need to go and tell Niko... that they're working. See? See? [chuckling] -[laughs] -Pretty good, huh? Parma at school taught me. You don't know Parma. I met her after you left. You'll meet her when you come back from space. -Oh, I can't wait. -Oh! And we also made up this totally new move called the wormhole. Watch. You see the cell shrinkage and the nuclei fragmenting? [sighs] Oh, my God, it's working. On you. Let's see if it works on someone -without your resistance. -Whoa, whoa, wait, wait! [sighs] I can feel the... the warmth spreading. Wait, I-- I didn't feel that. [grunts] [gasps and coughs] Ow! [grunts] The blister, it's already forming. Oh, the virus is accelerating. Okay, so what do I do? -What do I do? What do you need? -Hurry. -Okay, take my notes. -What? What? Wait. What? What? No! No, no, no, no! Come on. No! -No. -[locks door] -[grunts] Press the button. -No. [sobs] Look... [wheezes] Push the button.  No. Oh, you goddamn useless piece of shit. Do something for once in your life and press the-- [grunts] I'm a dead man anyway. [groaning] Bernie! [beeping] [alarm blares] Press the fucking button, Bernie! [shuddering] [whirring] [airlock hisses] [sighs] Come on, damn it. There's gotta be something we missed. -[William appears] -Bernie? It's time. [sighs] No, all right? No way is this piece of shit alien goddamn rogue virus gonna destroy our mission. Killer stars, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions and we're taken out by something we can't even see. You guys deserve better than this. Is there anything I can do? Um... Anyone you wanna see or talk to? I... uh... I know it's not the real thing, but if you wanted to speak with... -say, your mother-- -Back up. -I'm sorry. I'm just-- -No, no, no, stay back! All right. Come back here, by the microscope. Ah! There! Do you see it? I know I've been a pain in the ass... more than a pain in the ass, and I just want you to know that I-- If this is you apologizing, we don't have much time. [sighs] I'm sorry. Me too. I'm sorry. [William appears] Wait! Bernie's coming with news. Wait! Don't! I have a cure! -What? A cure? -The virus reacted sensitive to-- -Bernie? -Yeah, go, go, go. The me you see is made up of a bunch of things. UV light, visible light-- and gamma rays. We believe if we blast the ship with enough gamma radiation-- It'll decontaminate it and us. Could that really work? If the source of the gamma rays is intense enough, it might. -So we fly the ship near Sirius. -But Sirius doesn't emit gamma rays. -Not enough. -[Niko] No. But Sirius B, the white dwarf, sure as hell does. [Niko] Everybody ready? [Cas] Yeah. Open the Crow's Nest. [deep rumbling] Lower the electromagnetic shield. [intense rumbling] -William! -Just a little longer. I'm sorry. We need to be sure. [birdsong] [woodpecker tapping] Thought maybe you weren't gonna show. Yeah? Well, I'm a man of my word. Honestly, I was surprised you called. I mean, you won. Yeah, not by a lot. Turns out me and my friends are not as smart as we think. That was eye-opening. [sighs] A data cube. What am I supposed to do with that? You're the hard-hitting reporter with over 250 million followers? Take this. Put it out there. See if they can figure it out. There's no sign of the virus. The ship is clean, too. What is it? Gamma radiation, li-- like all... radiation is... very dangerous. Not just to alien life-forms. Sorry to tell you this, but you've all been... -What? -You've been-- We've all been sterilized. Uh, I'm sorry. Are you saying that I'm not gonna have kids? I know that this is a shock to all of us. Any of you need to talk or need anything-- Fuck this fucking mission. Hey. It's better than our nervous systems bursting out of our shoulder blades. Javier? Everybody meet in somatic in an hour. [Bernie] We woke him up into a literal nightmare. But Julian, he... [sighs] He knew what was important, and he... fought for it till the end. For nothing. It wasn't for nothing, Bernie. He'd still be with us right now if he hadn't gone after that stupid cure. And then you wouldn't have found the real cure and we would all be dead. The biggest sacrifice each of us made was signing up for this mission, Bernie.
