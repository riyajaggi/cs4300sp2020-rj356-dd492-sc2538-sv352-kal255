 He's got needles or blades or something coming out of his eyes! Quick! Let him go! [grunts] -[Salvare] Security zone activated. -Sasha. -Why are you doing this? -How does it feel to be scared, Niko? To feel useless? Powerless. Look, I am sorry... that I didn't treat you the way that I should have. That I said things that... I regret. You deserved better from me. What about William? Did he deserve better from you, too? [alarm blaring] August, talk to me.

 Temperature in the particle accelerator is climbing into dangerous territory. -[Niko] Okay, meet me there. -She would, except she's stuck. -Stuck where? -On the wrong side of a closed door. -Zayn? Bernie? -[Zayn] Yeah, we're in the lab. -It's getting really hot. -[beeps] Niko? [Salvare] Particle accelerator nearing critical temperature. -Can you hear me? -Sasha's turned off the comms. He's cutting us off. Splitting us up. -But why? -Super conductivity degrading. He's turned off the cooling system to the particle accelerator. If the core goes above its critical temperature... We blow up. I don't-I don't understand. Why would they pick Sasha to do their dirty work? He's exactly who I'd pick. Somebody lonely. Somebody vulnerable. Someone who's been hurt. Somebody who I've hurt. Who they could easily turn against the mission. I've gotta get to August. Get her to the accelerator. -Michelle died trying to shut that down. -I know. We don't have a choice. -What can I do? -Stay with Beauchamp. Get him on oxygen. Find out everything you can about Sasha. -We need to know his weaknesses. -Okay. Come on. -Niko! It's stuck. -What's happening? Why won't William respond? Why are the doors locked? I'll explain, but now we need to get this door open and get you out of there. [groans] Ready? [metal grinding] 350-pound door. You'd think it'd be easier. -[August] Guys? -Yeah? -Temp's near critical in the accelerator. -How long can it hold? We're looking at an hour tops before the hull breach-- Damn it! August, hold your side of the door, yeah? -Grab it. -Okay. -Just hold it. Got it? -Okay. -Yeah. -[Niko groans] Okay, guys, give it all you got. Come on. Go. Just a bit more. -Okay, hold it, hold it. -August, go, go, go. [gasps] -Okay. -[gasps for air] -Let's move. -No. No, we-we can't. The temperatures are still rising on the lower decks. -We won't get to engineering. We'll cook. -Bernie's down there already. How can we communicate with Bernie and tell him what needs to be done if the comms are down? We won't be using our comms. On the count of three, we open it, and we run. One... two... three. -[heat blasts] -Aah. Close it, close it, close it. -Aah. -Oh, shit. We'll fry out there. There's gotta be another way. Okay, there it is. We gotta clear it out. Damn it. We're gonna have to do this manually-- increase pressure, add a fault to the end. -I could use your help. -Get in there. Ready? Unreliable piece-of-shit technology. I'm not talking about this shit tube. I'm talking about William. -Isn't he programmed to be on our side? -"Trustworthy by design." Had us all fooled. Okay, even if we do get him back, how will we ever trust him again? We need to build up more pressure. -He's disobeyed orders before. -Yeah, but that was to save my life. Yeah, which is ironic, 'cause Javier is lying on his death bed right now. -William did nothing to stop it. -You wanna blame someone? -Blame me, all right? -What? -It's my fault. I-- -Oh, shit. Here it comes. Okay, one more pump. [hisses] [gurgling] Wait. Hold on. Just... stay here. [gurgling continues] [gasps] [sloshing] Wait! [both gasp] -What the... -[both groan] Oh, shit! Oh, my God, I can't breathe. That's sewage from Soma Chamber Seven. It routes back to the nutrient recycling.  [Niko] Bernie? Zayn? -What? -Niko? Hey? Bernie, you guys have hazmat suits down in the lab, right? Yes, why? Bernie, I need you to go to the particle accelerator -and turn the cooling system back on. -Me? -If you can't do it, can Zayn? -No, no, no, I'll... -I'll do it. -Great. Go. There's no time to waste. -Wait. Where are you going? -Plan B. In case Bernie doesn't make it. Niko Breckinridge. William, thank God. We need your help. [bang] [Salvare] Temperature in particle accelerator critical. Why do you look different than you normally do? I'm experiencing a system critical error preventing my normal operation. Okay. You have to be backed up somewhere, right? Your thoughts, your actions, your conversations-- -they've gotta be stored somewhere. -Those files are no longer available. Um... go back. Go back 12 hours. [whirring] The files are no longer available. Go back three days. Two weeks. Just... search all directories, all systems. Searching all directories and all systems. William. You are still in there. You don't need permission to come back. Just will yourself out of wherever it is that you are. Those files are no longer available. I am so sorry. [Dubois] Erik? Come on. Harper refuses to speak to me beyond stating her name and asking for you. -Me? Why? -I don't know. -So why don't we find out? -No. Erik-- My daughter's in there because that thing attacked her, so Harper's gonna have to find someone else to talk to because I'm done. I don't think this is really Harper anymore. Jesus Christ. We've been looking for a way to communicate with the aliens. Seems we finally have one. [door opens] You're a sight for sore eyes. Heh. Just stick to the script. Start with number one and work your way down. [whispers] You look tired. How are you feeling? Any headaches  or changes in thought pattern? Question number one. Cutting to the chase, I'm all right. You want to know about the implant in my brain? Yeah. Was it put there by force? You know it wasn't. I need you to answer the question. Fine. I gave them the green light. The go-ahead. Next question. Who exactly are "they"? Do they have a name? Because when I was in there, all I saw was... humans or... -representation-- -The Achaia. They're called the Achaia. And their home world? Is it circling Pi Canis Majoris like we think it is? You know... Erik, they... they liked you. You're open-minded, a peacekeeper. But you weren't... quite... right. You know? Is that because you have something that I don't have? Such as? -An audience. -Tsk. Is that question number two, -or are we totally off-- -It wouldn't be the craziest idea, right? More people trust you than they trust their own mothers. You don't trust me or them. -And I understand why. -You do? Yes. Jana. Erik? They are so... -sorry. -Erik, next question. When they set off that energy surge, which they did to protect themselves, they didn't realize that Jana was anywhere nearby. She has... a genetic anomaly. Ionizing radiation harms her more than other people. More than other children. -How do you know this? -We're ending this-- -What do I do? Is there a cure? -They can cure her. -Tell me what to do. -Get him out of here. -They can cure her. -Get off me. -I can help you. They can cure her. -[yelling] Get your fucking hands off me. Let go. She can save my daughter. Harper! Harper! What shall we do tonight? After all this is over, we deserve to relax, don't you think? -Take a long, long shower. -Yeah. So maybe a massage that feels like it could last days and days. I see what you're doing... and I appreciate it. I really do. I can't think of anything except that I'm gonna die and let everybody down. You won't. -This suit has a cooling system-- -It's not enough, Zayn. Let's be realistic. A crazy awesome thing just happened... and I should've realized it sooner... but I didn't. [sighs] [helmet seals] Bernie? Hey, look at me. Saving the real deal for when you get back, safe and sound. Yeah. [dance music playing] Cooling system one reengaged. Cooling system two reengaged. Cooling system three reengaged. Come on. Come on. -[beeps] -[hissing] Hah. ♪ But I see no reason ♪ ♪ Because you make me feel...♪ [Salvare] Cooling systems reengaged. This is the part where they put up a fight. Cooling system disengaged. What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no! What the fuck did I do? Cooling systems reengaged. -No, goddamn it, no. -Cooling systems disengaged. -Fuck. -[Sasha] We can keep doing this all day. Think. Think. Think. Come on. [alarm beeps] [Salvare] Warning. -Particle accelerator overheating. -Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. -[groaning] -[crackling] Fuck. Turn off the fucking cooling systems in the particle accelerator. [Salvare] Connection to cooling system severed. Come on. God! God. Aah. ♪ This is how I feel ♪ Wake up. -Wake up. -♪ This is how I feel ♪ ♪ This is how I feel ♪ Ah. Bernie. Bernie, no. -Bernie. Bernie. -♪ This is how I feel ♪ Shit. No, no. no, no, no, no. Come on. Come on, Bernie. It's not over. You hear me? -[exhales] -♪ This is how I feel ♪ ♪ This is how I feel... ♪ Cut oxygen to every deck below observation. Unable to override the fail-safe. Command must be executed manually. -How the fuck do I do that? -Each level has a redundant manual system. -Shut up! Gah. Aah. -[loud humming] -♪ This is how I feel ♪ -Oh. I got it. I got it. Come on. Stay with me. Come on, Bernie. Come on. Come on. -[gasps for air] -Oh. Bernie? [whirring] Access new data bank. [song ceases] Scan local quadrants. Stop. Zoom in. Again. Set course for-- [Salvare] Unauthorized activity detected in Somatic Chamber Two. Manual soma override. Three minutes until completion. Come on, hurry up. [gasps for air] Niko? Why are you doing this manually? It's okay, Azami. Just a couple more minutes, all right? [Sasha] Niko? Hello? Sure, Azami's a good software engineer, but she's no Javier. And untangling William? Well... that's gonna take more than being a good student. Accept it, Niko. -You can't win. -Neither can you. Destroying the first ship we send out is a path that'll lead to destruction. Niko, what's going on? You've got all the destruction you need right here. Operation Brimstone? Tell me, did my father pick that name? It's why he chose you over Yerxa, isn't it? 'Cause he knew you'd have no problem executing that plan. -[Niko] I don't want to hurt anyone. -Bullshit. And you don't, either. The real Sasha came on this mission because he thought he could broker peace. Peace? Since when do humans give a shit about peace? This ship can literally blow up an entire fucking planet. We won't use it. -I won't use it. -Really? -And I'm just supposed to believe you? -Yes. Because you know me. Yes, I do, Niko. I do know you, and I know what you did to William. He would rather disappear into oblivion than feel the pain you inflicted on him. Thank you for that. You would be killing a bunch of kids. You know that, right? Why kill them because of what might happen? The real Sasha wouldn't do that. -I don't have a choice. -Yes, you do. This is a mistake that you can't take back. -It's not me. It's them. -Who? Who is "them"? -It's the Achaia-- Aah. -[whirring] Okay. You tell the Achaia that we don't wanna fight, we don't wanna go to war. That's not who we are. That is not why we are here. -[groaning] -Look. Destroying this ship, killing everyone on it... Sasha, you're gonna force humanity's hand. [sighs] Cut oxygen to soma tube 1 dash 12-- Azami Ouchi. -Disconnecting. -What? No. [gasps for air] Release the lock. Release the lock! Damn it. [alarm beeping] Think about your father. This is treason. Think for yourself for once in your fucking life, Sasha. Come on, stand up for yourself. Fuck! You homicidal bastard. Why delay the inevitable? Beauchamp? Wake up. That's my boy. Come on, all the way. -Not the face I was hopin' to wake up to. -Nice to see you, too, asshole. -Sasha. Sasha. -Hey. -Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy. -No-- -[groans] -Easy. Hey. -He's got somethin' in his head. -We know. Do you know anything else? Ah. He was searching my brain... for weaknesses in our defenses, anything he could use. -He's gonna destroy us. -All right. Let's find Niko and figure out how to get that asshole off the ship. [sighs] Now you're talkin'. Okay, hey? A little help. Yeah, come on. [machinery clanking] -Fuck. -[Salvare] FTL engines engaged. Sasha didn't initiate the FTL to take us on a Sunday stroll. -We're headed deeper into the dark matter. -Is that their language? Sure as hell's not ours. [August] Those files didn't originate from anywhere in our ship's systems. Then why are we seeing it? Sasha must've hardwired himself directly into the Salvare. -Is that even possible? -If the implant is symbiotic enough to take control of his cerebral cortex, then, yes. Jesus Christ. [Zayn] What is it? It's a black hole. [ship creaking] He's steering us directly towards a goddamn black hole. Grab everything you can. The mission comes first. Grab essentials--food, water, supplies. Head to the shuttle. -We're abandoning ship? -Where are we supposed to go? Right there--Pi Canis Majoris. Sasha did one thing right. He got us closer to our destination a hell of a lot faster. But we gotta move, guys. [Beauchamp] All right. [Zayn] Do we have enough water? -[Zayn] We're running out of room. [Oliver] Put a basic kit together. -[Cas] Do we have enough fuel rods? -[Zayn] Help with that. [Beauchamp] Right. It goes behind the fuselage panel. [Zayn] Here. No. No way are we leaving without you. It is my fault. Cas, it's all my fault. No. This is Sasha's fault. He's the one who let that alien into his head. I am talking about William. He shut down because of me. He's in love with me. And I knew that. I knew it. And still, I had him turn into Erik, and then we were together. And then afterwards, I pretended like it didn't happen, and I just... threw him away. Treated him like he was nothing. Less than nothing. So what? -So what? -You were lonely. You had a moment of weakness. Guess what. You're human. Just like the rest of us. Okay, William's gone, but we cannot go on without you. I have to fix this. Save the ship. Save the rest of the crew. Or I'm gonna die trying. Can I help you? [Niko] William? William? [creaking] [thunder rumbles] William. God, we need to leave now. Like, where is she? She'll be back any second. You know how little thrust these engines have, right? Hey, we'll make it. -Move! -What? Move. Your brains got scrambled. Move. Come on. What is going on? Where is Niko? [engines engage] [pulsing hum] [water ebbing] [Niko] It's beautiful. Isn't it? What I did to you is unforgivable. It's all right. Don't be upset. Nothin' hurts here. It's okay. It's not okay. I know that you buried it deep inside, but you have to remember. Shut up. You're ruinin' it. You're right. I ruined it. I ruined everything. I ruined our friendship, and I will regret that for the rest of my life, but I need you. We need your help. You need me. What about what I need? It matters. -God, it matters so-- -All right, just stop. Stop... manipulatin' me! I'm not. I'm not. Look, I need you to remember the hurt and the pain because it's the only way you will remember what came before -which is the hope and the joy-- -[Sasha] Niko! What you are avoiding feeling... we all feel. It's what makes you human. You are more than a data stream. You are real. You are alive. You shouldn't have come here. The emotions hurt... but they are also beautiful. Come back. Don't let some asshole like me take away your meaning. [Sasha] Niko! Niko! William! [Niko] William! William! William, please! William! [sighs] -[gasps] -[yells] William, I'm sorry. He can't hear you. William's dead. [bleeping] [metal creaking] [creaking increases] [sighs] Never thought I'd be happy to see plain old space again. There's nothing plain about this. Is that... Pi Canis Majoris? [August] Mm-hmm. [pinging] Come on, Niko. [William] Niko. -You came back. -We don't have much time. [groans] I blasted the deck with electricity. He's taken the brunt of it. It serves him right for havin' a chunk of alien metal stuck in his head. Can we pull away? I've tried. We don't have enough power to pull clear of the black hole's gravity, and once we've passed the point of tidal disruption, the Salvare will be stretched to complete structural failure. -Yeah. -What are you thinkin'? That thing in his head-- it's gotta have a power source, right? Will that give us the boost we need? [helicopter hovers] Come on, let me back in there, Blair. -Erik-- -Come on. Think. She is using a sick child as a negotiating chip. -She's playing you-- -Let her play me all she wants, okay? Jana is dying, and she can save her. Jana is dying, and you're fucking killing her 'cause you're fucking scared. Cas, if they could escape the black hole, they would've done it by now. -They're gone. -Shut up. We need to land and finish this mission. It was Niko's final order. -You need to shut the fuck up, Beauchamp. -No. No, you do. I'm now in charge. Chain of command starts with me. I don't care about chain of command. I'm worried about Niko, the woman who's saved our ass the whole mission. Guys! Look out the window. The stars are warping. Come in, Salvare, and confirm who I'm speaking with. -[bleep] -[Niko] Who do you think? William and I have control of the ship, so get your butts back here. This mission isn't over. [buzzing] I wanted him to kill you. I don't blame you. Thank you for saving my life, again. I did it for the mission, not you. [machine beeping] [groans] Harper, hey, it's Erik. -Can you hear me? -Mm. How do I save Jana? Just tell me how to save my daughter. The only way... you can save Jana... [whispers] is if you get me out of here. Here we go.
