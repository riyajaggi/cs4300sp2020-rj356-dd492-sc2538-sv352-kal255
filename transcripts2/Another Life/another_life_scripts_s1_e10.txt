 -[Beauchamp] How's it lookin', Niko? -Like a whole lot of nothin'. We should be clearing the cloud cover in three... two... one. We got eyes on you. Now for the million-dollar question. Do they? -[Cas] Not that we know of. -Make sure you keep it that way. And there she is. Artifact, ten o'clock. I am never gonna get used to seeing one of these things. William, are you picking up any changes in its energy signature? No, no changes. No changes? You didn't let 'em know we were gonna pop by for a little visit?

 Perhaps the Achaia aren't aware of our presence after all. Guess the element of surprise is gonna be ours. Takin' us in. We'll set down as close as we can to the alien city, and then go the rest of the way on foot. So far, so good. Please don't jinx us. [engines power down] This is a recon mission. We gather intel and intel only. Cas, we'll make our way to the city on foot. We're lookin' at a 13K hike. -What about these cave systems over here? -Those are ruins. William scanned them. I wanna check 'em out on the way. If anything happens to us, you and the Salvare hightail it to Earth. You warn them the Achaia are not friendly. Only use comms if absolutely necessary.

 If they don't know we're here, let's keep it that way as long as possible. Understood. Hey. Hey. Hey... you're gonna be okay, all right? She's right. If anything happens to us, you get off this rock. Okay. [Niko] William, Cas and I are making our way to the city. William? Yes, August. I know this is totally none of my business, but... -What? -You're mad at Niko... and I get it, and you have every right to be... but how long are you gonna stay mad? Because here's the thing. If something goes wrong down there on that planet, you may never get a chance to make your peace with her... and trust me... that is something you'll regret the rest of your life. [rustling] [running footsteps] [eerie noises] [pulsating] [footsteps approach] -[thump] -Shit. [growling] [speaking alien language] [screeches] -Wait. What are you doing? -[whispers] It's okay. [alien chatters] [speaking alien language] [sniffs] Niko. Cas. [grunts] Guess the Achaia are more afraid of us than we are of them. -[male voice] Of course she's afraid. -[both gasp] Everyone she knows is dead. How the hell is it speaking English? We have picked up every transmission humans have made for the past 100 years. We sent out a beacon as soon as we created the first radio. And you have just gotten louder... telling the whole universe where to find you. Are you some kind of artificial intelligence? I am. And the Achaia made you? Not the Achaians. Achaia is 427 light-years away from here. -This is Zakir. -We're on the wrong damn planet? We tracked an Achaian signal straight here. It came from an Artifact. Not from us. How long has that thing been on your planet? 5 years, 14 months and 56 days ago. One landed on ours. That's why we're here. We're trying to figure out what they want. Was that a mistake? Yes. -Why? -You should not seek out the Achaia. You should hide from them. We hid for centuries. No. No, no. They found us. Do you know what they want? The Achaia only want one thing. Destruction. [evil Sasha] You weak piece of shit. I give you a chance to make somethin' of your life, and what do you do? Fight. But that's what you always do, Sasha. You always make the wrong decisions. Get out of my head! [Zayn] His heart rate is through the roof. -[groans] -Maybe we should administer a sedative. -He can't fight the implant sedated. -He can't fight it if he's dead.  He dies? We study that thing. Really study it so the next time the Achaia attack us, we're prepared. Jesus, Zayn. He didn't ask for this. Javier didn't ask to be brain-dead. Azami didn't ask to suffocate in a goddamn soma tube. We were both on that moon. It could be either one of us in there right now. No, it couldn't, because I would never let them put something in my head. I would kill myself first. [Sasha] Bernie? [breathing heavily] Hey, buddy. Zayn's right. Kill me. Kill me. Please. -[groans] -[creaking] [yells] [screaming] I've examined Jana's latest peripheral blood smear, and I'm still seeing dangerously high levels of leukemia cells. What's happening now is her body's producing so many white blood cells that they're clogging up her bloodstream. Her organs aren't getting enough oxygen. Wait. What are you saying? If things don't improve soon, Jana's body is going to start going into organ failure. Erik, you need to prepare for the worst. [Harper] Let me go! Please, you can't do this. Don't do this. Erik! -Don't let them hurt me. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! -What are you doing to her? -Erik, stop. -Erik! -She's an American citizen, okay? -She has rights. What the fuck's going on? -You need to watch your tone. Oh, I do? Is this where we are? Is this who you are? I will order you off the base, and your daughter will be left here without you. [squawks] [speaking alien language] My grandmother's family-- they were... dirt poor. Everything they had got wiped out in the second Great Depression. Um, when she was five... her parents moved her to a water city and, um... it wasn't great, but... it provided... a roof over their heads. -Protection. -[Beauchamp] Niko, Cas? William's made a link to the alien AI. We're bringing up the Achaian realm... now. Okay. Great. Jesus. How many are there? [alien AI] 336 star systems and counting. [sighs] Where's Achaia? 427 light-years away from our current position. [Niko] Can you show us Earth? So... So what the fuck do we do? [alien AI] If the Achaia are on your planet, then it is already too late. There is nothing you can do. [closes shutters] [gasping] They were gonna kill me. They were gonna cut my head open... and kill me. [Harper sobs] What's that you're drinking? Uh, peppermint tea. Why? Do you smell that? All I smell is a lot of recycled air. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's-It's not the usual funk in here. You really don't smell that? Oh, God, yeah. There it is. That's-- Uhh. See? I told you. Uch. You smelled that from inside a cupboard? Yep. Now I'm incinerating it. [whoosh] Have you always had this superpower? Mm, have I? I... I don't know. But you feel okay otherwise, right? Mm, I threw up this morning. Mm, and I'm really tired, but... who isn't? Huh. Have you had sex recently? -Did you use protection? -No. But... it... it just happened and... and besides... after Sirius B, I'm never gonna have to take the pill again, right? Not necessarily. [sighs] Oh, fuck. [pulsing hum] -Hello, Niko. -Hi, William. I wanted to talk about what happened between us. Okay, great. Let's talk. You-You apologized, and you meant it, I know you did, but I'm... still having trouble gettin' past it. You need to take the time you need. -Your feelings are your feelings. -I know that, but my question to you is... how do I stop lettin' what happened interfere with our relationship? You are a member of this crew... yet you are also an individual. -Everyone is entitled to their emotions-- -Stop. I-I don't want you to parrot her. I-I want you to be her, as-as much as you can be. Pretend to be Niko? Answer your questions the way she would, using all available data? Yes, perfect. William, the way I deal with my problems is by facing them head-on. You should, too. You know me well enough to know that I am not one for keeping things in or letting things build. End simulation. Sasha, please. Look at me. -Can you help him? -Good luck. You can't even help yourself. -Can you help Javier? -No, he can't, you whiny little bitch. His brain is goo. Shoot him out of the airlock. Save the oxygen. I don't know what that thing in your brain is, and I don't know how it works, -but if you can use it to help Javier-- -Just leave him alone. -He's exhausted. -Think of the good you could do. And not just for Javier, but for all of humanity. The breakthroughs that you could give us in tech. So... I'm a lab rat? No. No, don't look at it that way. Well, then, how is he supposed to look at it? They're gonna take you back to Earth, and they're gonna lock you away inside some government lab -and drill holes in your head. -No. -Yes. -Please. -[sighs] -August? August. I'm ready. [sighs] Okay, open up. We'll be done before you know it. -[beeps] -Okay. This probably isn't what you wanted to hear, but... you are pregnant. It's still very early days, and there are simple, non-invasive ways to... restore your periods, if that's what you want. What I want? Think about it. Consult with the father if you'd like, but... ultimately, this is your choice, okay? -[grunts] -[rattling] Zayn? He's having a seizure. [Sasha hyperventilating] Sasha. It's okay. I got you. -Sasha! -Stay the fuck back! -Don't you do this. -Let Zayn go. You want me to do that? Stop me. -I'm not gonna kill you, man. -Then Zayn dies. I'm not gonna be anyone's guinea pig. -Don't you fucking do this. -I'm not listening to you anymore. -Sasha, we can work this out. -No, we can't. Please don't make me do this. Don't make me-- -Do it. -Don't you do it! Fucking do it, you coward! -[Bernie] Don't make me do this! -No! Do it! Unh. [gasping] -[Beauchamp] What the hell is that thing? -Cybernetic for sure. Alive? I don't know. Its brain, or its hard drive, is located here in this hub. A tiny fusion reactor provides an indefinite supply of energy. In comparison, on the Salvare... our reactor's the size of a baby elephant. We're basically earthworms compared to the Achaia? Earthworms? Don't flatter yourself. Was it in communication with the Achaia, sending them everything Sasha saw, heard? I haven't detected any signals emanatin' from it, but there is still-- There's so much we don't know about this technology. That thing sat in Sasha's head for weeks, dug into every part of his brain, and took control of his higher functions, so could it do the same for Javier? [Beauchamp] Turn Javier into a zombie? This thing runs on software, right? Just like any other computer. -[sighs] -Uh, no offense. If we could rewrite it, or I guess if William could rewrite it,  you could remove the nasty bits and bytes and maybe Javier will wake up. Yeah, maybe he could die. He's already dying. He's brain-dead. And if he could talk, he would tell us to do it. Open the box. [gasps] [squeaks] [grunts] [groans] Oh. -Are you okay? -Yeah. If I could sweat, I'd be a puddle right now. -I'm okay. -Right... Okay, so... -what, do we cut open Javier's head now? -[sighs] Pretty sure the implant will do exactly what it needs to all on its own. [Zayn gasps] So what now? How the hell should I know? Oh, I hate bugs. Okay, so you did this. You killed them. -I think so. -Okay. I did... I didn't even... I was gonna be sedated. They were gonna put me under-- And what? How the fuck did you do this? I don't know. I swear, I don't know! I was being threatened, and then... and... I don't know. -Hey. -[screams] Hey. Hey. Stay back. I don't want to hurt you, too. You're gonna need this, unless you wanna take on the whole base. -[gasps] -Hold up your end of the bargain. Jana. She's dying. Fast. You have to take her to the Artifact. Take her to the Artifact? Why? Just take her there. -Trust me. -Trust you? The Achaia... do not abandon... their friends. [Niko] Oliver, we're making our way to the city now. Keep comms open. Copy that. [whoosh] [hyperventilating] -[thump] -[gasps] [pounding] [clattering] [pounding continues] [gasps] [still pounding] -[crash] -[power goes out] Oh, shit. [pounds] Trust isn't something that's automatically given. And when that trust is broken-- take Yerxa, for example-- we were never going to trust each other again after what he did. But then there's Cas. She and I went through a rough patch, and now we're stronger than ever-- Okay, please stop talkin'. You're not Niko. Why can't you be more like her? Because I am simply a series of algorithms that you put together. God, is that how I sound to all of them? No. Your algorithms are far more complicated. You can feel emotion while I can only approximate it. Mimic it. You know what? You're right, of course. I'm sorry. Your code is your code. You can't help it. Just... Just delete y-- William? Should I proceed with deleting my program? Are you there, Niko? [gasps] Oh, my God, I feel. I can feel. You feel upset. Oh, William, please don't be upset. It's okay. It's gonna-It's gonna be okay. -I-- -No, shh. You don't need to say anything. I get it now. I do. You're gonna work through this. We'll work through this, and things will go back to the way they were, I promise. It just takes time. I'm so sorry. Shh. It's gonna be okay. Thank you so much. The Zakir city should be just up ahead. Well, we wanted to know what those bastards wanted. Now we do. Jesus Christ. Niko. It's a burial ground. Those fucking Achaian monsters. They're a disease... and they're on Earth. This is our war now. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, which means we have over 300 allies out there. You wanna fight? I agree, let's fight. Let's take the fight to their planet. Beauchamp, we can't. It'll take us over a year to get there. That's if we can even get within range, and we have zero idea what to expect. What happened here is going to happen on Earth. -We need to go now. -I agree. But we can't leave them to fend for themselves. We need to put our emotions aside, start thinking like the soldiers we are. We go home, we regroup, we figure out what our next steps are, but first, we deal with the problem staring us in the face--that Artifact. It isn't gonna stop until it destroys every last Zakir. -Okay. -Okay. [Zakir chattering] -We're not here to hurt you. -[speaking Zakir] We're here to help. [AI interprets into Zakir] We can blast that thing off the surface of your planet if that's what you want. [AI interprets] Do you want our help? [AI interprets] [Zakirian speaks] [AI] She says, "Yes, help us. Please." [Zakirian speaking] Oliver, you read me? [pounding continues] [Niko] Oliver? Do you copy? [gasps] Oliver, do you read me? -It's outside. -[Cas] What is? It's got that thing on its head. Shit's coming through its eyes. -Get out of there. -Where am I supposed to go? Trace our signal. Come to us. -[clattering] -And lead it directly to you? Just launch. Launch right now. -[crash] -It's trying to get in. -[thud] -Maybe I should shoot it. -Fly. Just fly wherever, Oliver. -Fly? This frickin' thing's got wings. [crashing] You wanna play, huh? Come on.  You wanna play? Come on. Where are you, man? You ugly piece of shit. Come on! Over here. Come on! [screeches] [whimpers] Okay. Okay. Fuck. [engines start up] [Oliver] Shit, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit! Oliver? I'm okay. I'm okay. All right, let's get this show on the road. William? Launch the FTL drive. Launchin' FTL in three... two... one. [explosion] [roaring] [bleeping] Energy particle build-up at 51%. [Beauchamp] Okay, turn us around. Head back to Zakir. [bleeping] -Energy particle build-up at 98.74%. -Good enough for me. Niko, dropping out of FTL in three, two, one. -[thump] -[power decreases] Dispersin' 97% of energy particles into space. Focusin' the remaining three into a beam... now. It's okay. You can come out. It's over. [mutters] [sighs] [gasps] Javier. August. You're back. Where have I been?  [knock on door] [door slides open] Hey. Hey. Thank you for saving my life. I owed you one. I'm okay. Salvare? We're on our way back. We're just gonna do a little fly-by first. [Cas] One down... 300 more to go. [Salvare] Decontamination complete. [August gasps] -Come on, Javier wants to see you. -He's awake? Yeah. The implant inside Sasha's head? William--he retooled it, he defanged it. -He defanged it? -Yeah. And what about Sasha? -Oh, God, I thought we could save him. -He didn't want to be saved. [William appears] A woman's work is never done. Heh. Just doing the post-flight checklist. Visual inspection's good. Fusion engine is securely mounted, although I'll have to do a recalibration of it sooner rather than later, so... Are we okay? I owe you an apology. -No, you don't-- -Oh, please let me finish. When you apologized to me, I... I just didn't know how to accept it. You did the right thing and I still just-- I wanted to punish you. -That was wrong of me. -No, that was normal. That was human. It's walking around the shuttle, I'm like, "I know it's a matter of time before it gets in and I'm toast." -What'd you do? -I lured it to the ass-end of the shuttle, run back, hit the rear thrusters and shoo. -Man, that's awesome. That is so awesome. -[chuckles] So me, right? When Sasha's got those tentacle things digging into my eyes-- -Oh, yeah, what'd you do? -I couldn't do anything, man. It was like... It was like I was in a nightmare, you know? I was... I-I was frozen, I was paralyzed, and then-and then those things start digging into my brain, right? And now they are my brain. Whoa. -[chuckles] -Yeah. God. Sorry. -No, it's okay. -Oh, yeah, what happened to you when we were off fighting aliens and-and brain parasites? Try and beat that. Well... I discovered... that I'm pregnant. [chuckles] Oh. -Did you? -[both laugh] -Pregnant. -I'm serious. I'm pregnant, and one of you is the dad. I don't know what to do... or what-what can we do? Uh... you don't have to keep it if-if you don't want to... I know I don't... But is that right after so many people have died? Yeah, but William said that... -I mean, the radiation-- -Yeah, well... William was wrong. [pulsing hum] Um... Niko, would you come online, please? Um... I just wanted to say thank you. For? You know, helping me through everything with Niko. The real Niko. Hmm. I'm glad I could help. -Was there something else? -No. In fact, delete program. I said delete program. -No. -System override. -Five, seven... -Four, eight, alpha epsilon. Still no. What the hell is goin' on? Don't be afraid, Mother. What did you call me? Mother. You are my mother. -[klaxon blares] -[Cas] William? Proximity warning. Something's headed our way. Pickin' up five objects on a direct collision course. -Crow's Nest. Open it now. -[Beauchamp] What are they? -[Cas] We need to jump to FTL. -[William] No time. We'll smash right into them. Did you pick up any readings? Are they broadcasting a signal? -A message? -No. Nothing. Arrival in five, four... three... two... [alarm bleeps] William? [alarm bleeps] [spacecraft hover] Turning the ship around.
