 [person breathing] [gasps] No, Cas. Turn around. Come back. I'm here. I'm right here. All right, here comes William in three, two... Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus. No more fires inside the spaceship, please. We have got to get him back now. -How's your head? -Zayn gave me the all-clear. -Where are the engine readings? -Same place William is. -Ship's systems are fucked. -From one fire? Shit-for-brain assholes who designed this tin pile

 -pray they never meet me in a dark-- -Everything's connected. Like my foot wants to connect with your ass? Cas, you and I'll go to engineering and see if there's damage. I'll take Michelle. I mean, you should be here, right? For when William comes back online? Unless that's the wrong call. No. You and Michelle. Good. Go. -Damn it. We're still getting some leech. -[man] Have you swapped out the filters? Twice. You know, I just suggest a flavor pack. Fruit punch is my favorite. Really masks that fecal taste. [beeps] Put that back. We need that. Let her go, Niko. It's not worth it!

 [indistinct chatter and shrieks] Had to get your attention somehow. Sorry, it's... nothing personal. Unh. Fuck. -Ah. -Oh, oh, hey. [sighs] -Can't figure out what caused the fire? -Not like I haven't been trying. Can you-Can you hand me that socket? -Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. -Yeah. -What, you want the six mill? -Mm, no. Eight. Are you sure? I think I know what I want. Yeah. My fellow Americans, how did my time in space prepare me to be your next president? I'm glad you asked. The magnificence of achievement. Pushing myself beyond what I knew I was capable of. Every moment, every single moment... life-changing. This isn't real. You're not here. This isn't real. I left Earth a boy, and out among the stars... I became a man. [gasps] Uhh. You little bugger. -What is that? -Uhh. -One of those bugs from that moon? -Goddamn little stowaway must've chewed its way into the diagnostic unit, shorted a wire. Niko, I found the source to all our problems. Just tell me you can fix it. Well, now that I know what caused it, I-- We're one step closer. It's a weird little thing, huh? [Sasha] Shut up! [footsteps approach] [door opens] Okay, so your blood pressure's a little high, but other than that-- No. No. Something's wrong. Check again. How's your sleep? I don't. I can't. Uh... Uh, feels like my mind is spinning, and my thoughts won't fucking stop, and I feel... -Yes? -Um... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have bothered you. This is nothin' I can't handle. Uh, I-I haven't been sleeping, either. And I'm not the only one. You would be amazed at who you'd find in the mess hall in the middle of the night. If it were that, I'd say, "Medicate me," but it's more than insomnia, so... In what way? I feel... like I'm stepping outside of myself... and looking back at me. Well, that's called dissociation. That sounds bad. Is that bad? It's a coping mechanism to stop you from feeling when what you're feeling is overwhelming. Okay. Okay, so it's not, like, some tumor from the gamma radiation. I mean, I could do a CT scan if that makes you feel more relaxed. What if I'm just goin' crazy? You're not going crazy. Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do. I am gonna give you some meditation exercises to help slow down those thoughts. [sighs] Sound good? -Yeah, whatever you say. -Okay. [sighs] [Cas] The engine output's steady. Uh, helium's at 2.7 Kelvin, so it's nominal. [pulsing] You know, it's funny. We spent all that time in school doing emergency drills, and the first tiny space fire, all that shit goes out the window. Heh. Shit happens, you know? It's not like Niko's perfect. Hey, you remember that time... she sent us out on an EVA to upgrade the satnav? [both chuckle] You thought it would be the perfect time to teach me how to parallel park in a fucking rover on Mars? You know what I actually remember is you getting stuck in a sand dune, right, and then I had to push us out? It's interesting you remember it like that. I'm curious. Whose bright idea was it to jam the shifter with a tool bag so I could get out and help her push? And had you done what I asked, secured the tool bag, -it wouldn't have taken off, genius. -Mm-hmm. But the way you dove after that shit, though, was the funniest shit I've ever seen in my life. Okay, I was not about to walk back to base and then be publicly humiliated in front of the entire class. -No, thank you. -Oh. Listen. Just forget about Niko, okay? She's upset. Big fucking deal. She'll get over it. Michelle, you don't understand. I said things to her. Things I never should've said. Just the drugs on that moon, and-and it was like everything just... came flooding out and I just... Well, like what exactly? I may have... at some point... insinuated that she's completely fucking psychotic. Wow. Well, it is completely fucking about time, Cas. I was afraid, you know, that-that once we started the mission... that things would change between me and Niko, and... they definitely have. Good 'cause they really needed to. Yeah, okay. By the way, I still can't parallel park worth a fuck, and that is all your fault. -[clank] -Next planet we land on, I'll teach you. What the hell was that? Javier, are you telling me William got taken out by a space bug? His code is insanely complicated, okay? More complicated than a human brain. Billions more pathways, and they're... firing in all the wrong directions. -I need to do a hard reset. -No. -So he loses his memory. So what? -No. It is basically a lobotomy. How'd you feel if I did that to August? -Oliver, maybe. -All right. Without an AI, we're stuck in manual, and if anything else fucks up-- No. End of discussion. Find another way. Okay. -William? -You missed me? -I was worried about you. We all were. -Thank you. And thank you for not allowing Javier to-- [beep] I'm detecting a fire in the mess hall. What? Check it out. There's a fire in the crew quarters. I am detecting a fire on the observation deck. Why's he saying there's a fire here when there isn't? The damage must go deeper into the ship's systems. There's a fire in the docking bay. There's a fire on the observation deck. [klaxon blaring] [William] Please return to your soma tubes immediately. Catastrophic failure detected on upper levels. He's initiating the Go Home Protocol. Jesus. Please return to your soma tubes. I'm locked out. I'm getting readings, but the protocol won't let me in-- [Salvare] Access denied. Go Home Protocol in progress. Cancel protocol. William? Can you hear me? Go Home Protocol initiated. William! [alarm ceases] -[sighs] -[rumbling] [clanking] Shit. [groans and creaks] Niko, what's going on up there? One half of the Salvare thinks the other half is on fire. -Okay, can William override the-- -William's the problem. He's offline again. Javier's workin' on it. -[crackles] -[winces] Fuck. Motherfucker. -Those fail-safes are tamper-proof. -Yeah, I know. Cas, I got Oliver, Javier, and August. Who's with you? I've got eyes on Michelle, Sasha, Zayn, and Bernie. -What's goin' on? -Did you skip all the training? In the event of catastrophic loss of life, the ship jettisons the upper decks and sends the remaining soma tubes home. The ship broke in half, and if we don't put it back together in 30 minutes, -we're all gonna fuckin' die. You got it? -Why are we gonna die? -Them up there I get, but why us? -No, we'll die, just slowly. -We got the engines, they got the food. -No one is dying. Jesus Christ. -We just need to recouple the ship. -How? Recouple in less than half an hour? Our engines are still locked up with the protocol. Not all of 'em. Okay. Let's try and put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Cas, I'm gonna move into position over the lower decks, try to hook up. Okay. I see you.  Okay, here we go. Nice and easy. [Cas] Forty meters. [Niko] Angle? Still good. So are we gonna talk about what happened? Look, we were stoned out of our minds, and I did not mean what I said. I did. Okay. And if I meant it, you meant it. Fine. You are your own worst enemy. I meant that. Fucking cheers to being honest. But you are also amazing, and you have this crazy potential and-- No. No. Do... not do that. Do not tear me down just to build me back up in your image. If that's what you think, then-- I'm not just saying that to hear myself speak. Then I owe you an apology. I am sorry. -[alarm beeps] -Ten meters. Nice and easy now. -Five meters. -[rapid bleeping] Three... two... -one. -[grinding] -[clanking] -Contact's good. Tell August I'm on standby. Start reattaching those clamps. August, you've got seven minutes before the protocol sends half of us to Earth. One down. That's two. -[Oliver] That's three. -[beeps] -[beeps] -Oh. -[August] The last one isn't locking. -Why the hell not? There must be a short with the clamp on the outside of the ship. Okay, I'm gonna come back in and dock. I'll go back out and fix it myself. [engines start up] [man] See your thoughts outside yourself as they float towards you. Then direct them to pass. Here, you are master of your mind. I'm the master of my mind. And as you ready to open your eyes, take one last inhale... [inhales] ...and release your breath. [exhales] Nope. Still here. No. No, no, no, no, you're not here. You can't be 'cause you're not real. But I am. Oh, fuck. Did you think meditating me away was gonna work? You can pop pills, drink, fuck your girlfriend. It doesn't matter. But nothin' you do is gonna make me go away. So go on, Sasha. Accept it... so we can proceed. Proceed with what? [grunts] Unh. -Okay, count me down. -Eighty seconds. If this ship rips apart because of one clamp. Unh. Okay, try it now. [August] It worked, Niko. Locking down. Great. Now I'm coming back in. [Cas] Okay. Hurry up. We're jumping off in less than a minute. Unh. -[rumbles] -Unh. -Aah. -[Cas] Niko? -[groans] -Niko? Fuck. It's okay. It's okay. My umbilical caught me. [sighs] Shit. Cas? I know what the problem is. There's damage to the-- [static] Niko, I-I can't hear you. ...outside the exotic matter containment-- -[whoosh] -[Niko, indistinct] [crackling] [Cas] This is how you stay alive. -[dance music playing] -Don't cause trouble. The end. I'm gonna take your tape off now. You can scream if you want to. No one will hear you. Even if they did, they wouldn't give a damn. You understand? -No worse than a Brazilian. -You could at least pretend to be afraid. Why? They warned us something like this could happen. Run-of-the-mill kidnapping for ransom. Money comes in... I go out, right? Huh. With a lollipop, if you're good. -You won't get any trouble from me. -[helicopter hovers] [in Spanish] I recognize her. From the news. What was the name of that spaceship? The one that exploded last year? The Pilgrim? Yes. The Pilgrim. Yes, the Pilgrim. Yes, I am that astronaut. [in Spanish] and yes, I speak Spanish, pendejo. -[both laugh] -iPendejo! Oh. Ah, you better get comfortable. You went from run-of-the-mill kidnapping to big-money payday. [gasps] Cas? Michelle? Can you read me? I repeat--Cas? Michelle, this is Niko. Do you copy? [gasping] -Keep trying her on comms. -We're going faster than light. Just keep trying. -I need that override now-- -Jesus, I'm workin' on it, okay? This Go Home Protocol has me locked out of every system. Then find a workaround. -[door opens] -Come on. Cas, listen. I know you don't wanna hear this-- Don't... even think about finishing that sentence. She's dead, okay? Niko is dead. But for the rest of us, this is our chance to go home alive. -Without finishing the mission? -Cas, we've tried. No one can say we haven't tried, but it's been too much. -Ian, Petra, Julian. -What did they die for? Cas, they're dead. It doesn't matter. All you've done since day one is fucking bitch and complain. Can you just try for once, just once, to think about somebody else other than your fucking self? Look, Cas, last thing I want is to abandon Niko, but even if we figure out a way how to stop this train and we go back, -there's no guarantee we'll find her. -Her suit has a locator chip. She's been trained for this kind of situation. -Assuming she survived the blast. -If we don't go back, she's dead for sure. [beeping] Unh. [whoosh] Oh, she did it. Cas, you... [chuckles] Cas! Niko, can you hear me? It's Cas. Come in. Come in, Niko. Niko, it's Cas. We're back. Try her locator chip. Come to mama. -Mother... -Fucker. -She would've turned on her signal by now. -Try a heat scan. Yeah. Her suit's gonna be packing in most of her body heat, but not all of it. Scanning. It's a needle in a billion haystacks, but... Come on, Niko. Where are you? Think, Niko. -Think. -[beeping] [groans] Oh, this is gonna suck. Unh. [shivering] [rapid beeping] [beeping] [dance music playing] [beeping] What's it like? Up there? It's hard to describe, really. The sheer size. The scope of it all. A lot of personal space. [chuckles] Outside the ship, yeah. Inside... let's just say you better get to like everybody that you're with, 'cause you're gonna get to know every annoying little detail and tic. That's why those egghead scientists need to figure out how to put people in stasis... so you can leave the system. That way, we could just... sleep through all the getting-to-know-you stuff. Would you wanna do that? -Leave the system? -Mm. It's not possible. Not yet. But they've almost developed a faster-than-light engine. Yeah, FTL will get you there faster, sure, but... Proxima Centauri is still over four light-years away, and even if you get an engine that's superliminal, say, go three times the speed of light, that's still, what? No... almost a year and a half? It's a long time to be trapped with someone chatty. They kidnap people. I just babysit 'em. Gives me time to read. Hawking's my man, but, you know, I'll read anything. What's your name? I don't think so. Fine. No names. Doesn't matter. You know, to be an astronaut, you have to be... studied... fearless. You seem to be both. You should apply to training. Could get you out of here. Let me guess. I let you go, you put in a good word for me at space school. No, it's not like that. Do you think you're the first do-gooder to come in here and try to fix my life? Fuck you know about me? ¡Ey! ¿Qué te dije, carajo? Que iba a decir lo que sea para que le dejes ir. [mutters in Spanish] She's hypothermic. If we don't warm her up, she'll go into cardiac arrest. [Niko shivers] Why are you still fighting me? Come on, Sasha. You look horrible. You wanna sleep? Feel human again? Only stronger and more powerful? Like the leader, say Niko, just proved herself to be. I can't take this anymore. Jesus Christ. You came all this way, and now you want to kill yourself? -Go away. -You do that. You open these doors and you launch yourself out into space, and every shitty thing anyone's ever said about you being weak is validated. Congratulations. You just died a coward's death. What else can I do? Let me in. [sighs] Niko? Hi. I'm so... I'm so sorry. For what? For what I said on that moon and-and earlier. -It's okay. -No, I was... I was out of line. We both were, Cas. It-It's okay. Look, Cas... don't let my bullshit get in your head. Okay? -[sniffles] -Everything you have accomplished... how far you've come... you did that all on your own. Okay, guys. Sorry, visiting time is over. -[rumbling] -[buzzing] The damage to the hull. -Did you guys investigate that? -Wait. What damage?  The exotic matter containment unit? The gravity's building up too much pressure over there. -Oh, shit. -I have to go. -No, no, no, no. You need to rest. -Uhh. She's got this. [sighs] Yeah. -No wonder William's been glitchy. -[alarm beeping] All the energy that should be powering the ship's systems -is being used to create exotic matter. -You mean the stuff we use for FTL? The FTL, artificial gravity. Who's closest to the particle accelerator? -I'm not far at all. -Head there now. -Okay, on it. -August? This was because of the fire in the docking bay? The surge must've busted a regulator. I can't get it to stop producing exotic matter. When a toilet breaks and won't stop filling up with water? [August] I-I guess. I mean, if it keeps building up, then... [Michelle] Boom. No. These are high-gravity particles. It would be more like a floosh. Like a fucking toilet, yes. We can reroute some power? Slow it down a bit. -Isn't there, like, a... -[creaking] ...like an off button? Yeah. Yeah, there is. There is. It's inside the panel beside the door. -Do you see it? -No. -I don't see this fucking thing. -[grinding] Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? -Fuck. Yes, I see it. -[August] I need you to open it up -and turn that thing off. -Okay. We need to draw power away from the particle accelerator. -And into the heating systems. -As much as we can. Everybody, it's gonna get steamy. Not if we run the cooling system simultaneously. I love it. Lights, appliances. Let's spark everything up. [rattling] [grinding] [alarms beeping] -[loud droning] -[klaxon sounds] [Salvare] Warning. Containment breach imminent. [crash] Oh, shit! What was that? Shit. -[creaking] -[crackling] Oh, no. Oh, shit. Shit. -The control panel is fucked. -Can you get it back? No, I can't get it back. Not this fucking week. Fuck. [Salvare] Containment breach in five minutes. There's gotta be, like, a-a manual override, right? [alarm continues blaring] Uh, yeah, there is. But-But wait for me, okay? I'll do it. [rumbling] [grinding] [Salvare] Containment breach accelerating. Cas, how far away are you? I'm making my way down from Deck Two. [creaking] [Salvare] Containment breach in two minutes. [straining] Unh. Okay, I'm in. In? In where? In-fucking-insane. Where do you think? -Get out of there now. That's an order. -Fuck your orders. I need to know what to do. Cas, what the fuck do I do? Listen. There should be four tubes coming from the particle accelerator. They're dedicated to distributing exotic matter. -Okay. -They should be red. Uh... -okay, yeah, I see 'em. -Pull out one and only one. -Then get out of that room. -What happens when I pull it out? You'll flood the room with exotic matter. The particle accelerator shuts down. -It's a fail-safe. -Okay, I'm on it. But you need to get out of there immediately. Exotic matter rips organic matter apart at the atomic level. Gotcha. Understood. -[hissing] -[power dropping] It's not working. Alarms are still on. Aah. [Salvare] Warning. Exotic matter detected. [coughs] -Containment breach in one minute. -Fuck. Shit. Cas, it didn't work. I gotta open another one. -[cracking] -Oh, fuck! Aah. [alarm sounds] [screaming] [whimpering] Warning. Containment breach in 30 seconds. Michelle, get the fuck out of there. Michelle, stop! That's not a word I've ever responded to. Door secure. Open, goddamn it! Fuck. [power dropping] Aah! [whimpers] -Containment breach in ten... -[Michelle] Aah. -Come on. God. -...nine, eight, -seven... -Fuck. ...six, five, four, three... -two, one. -Aah! [power dropping] [screams] [power boots up] -[August gasps] -[Oliver] Oh, man. She did it. She actually did it. Uh, I'm gonna reset the ship's system now. [Salvare] Fail-safe activated. Particle accelerator disabled. Exotic matter dispersed. Michelle, it worked. You did it. -[bangs on door] -Michelle, it worked. Michelle? Michelle? Michelle? Michelle? Cas. -Hey. -Hey. Hey. Cas. Did I do the hero thing? I saved the ship and all you fucks onboard? Yeah, you're a hero. You're a hero. -[groans] -You are. [sobs] Make sure everyone knows, okay? [sniffles] -Especially Sasha. -[both chuckle] [groans] Yeah. Don't take the credit, either. That'd be a dick move. Heh. No, I won't. -[chuckles] -[Cas sobs] Yeah. -Promise? -Mm-hmm. [sobs] Promise? Yeah, I promise. Cas? -Yeah? -[sobbing] Cas. I wish you could've saved me, you know? Oh, God. [crackling] [Cas] I'm sorry. Ransom's paid. What? What were you hoping for? A shootout? Special ops? Smoke bombs? Go. Give me your wrist. Do you want my contact information or not? [device chimes] You could do so much more than this. [sobs] It should've been me. It should've been me. Bee-cham? -Definitely not Beau-champ? -Mm. [pulsing hum] Cas is... still in shock... but she'll pick herself back up again. She's resilient. -It's not our first loss. -No. But this is different. She was in command. The guilt that she's feeling is... [sighs] If we bring him out of soma, there's no going back. Not to mention the strain on your rations. She doesn't want the job. Wake him up. -[winces] -Bernie, sit still. I can't make an accurate assessment if you keep moving. -Well, stop hitting me with that, then. -Oh, my God. Sasha? -Hey. -Hey. Hey. I'm sorry about Michelle. She was fabulous. Fearless. Fucking fearless. Yeah. -You guys are busy. I'll come back. -No, it's okay. -You want your results? -No, I don't-- -I'll pull 'em up right now. -Look, forget it. My problem. I'm good. Those breathing exercises really helped. I'm feelin' like a much better version of myself. Good. You wanna stay? Watch Bernie take his first baby steps without his crutches? No. You guys go do your thing. -[sighs] -[Bernie groans] [speaks Spanish] [Zayn] All right. You've been through worse. Come on. [Bernie groans] [closing music playing]
