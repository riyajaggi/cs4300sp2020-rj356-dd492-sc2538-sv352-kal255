 You hear that, gentlemen? This is the sound of opportunity knocking. Don't be slow to answer the door. J.D. : l still can't believe you did it. l mean, slapping all that money down on the saloon? EZRA: Well, l've been living parsimoniously. J.D. : Parsi-what? EZRA: l've been saving. J.D. : Oh. Now that the down payment's been made. . . . . .all that's needed are a few prudent investors to infuse a little working capital. Mr. Jackson? l don't know, Ezra. What do you know about running a saloon?

 l've spent my whole life in saloons. You may trust l have ample experience. What about you, Josiah? Money is like manure. Not good except it be spread. May l take that as an affirmative? No. Gentlemen, gentlemen, envision the future. Glistening wood, sparkling mirrors, a new piano, lush green felt tables. That does sound good. And it proves you're a smart lad. -You know the answer to the question. J.D. : You bet. -What's the question? -The question is. . . . . .what does everyone in this town want to do? What does every visitor here want to do?

 Leave? They want to drink, my friends. They want to hear music and gamble. And where's the only place they can do that? l give you the Standish Tavern. l can hear the jingle of the cash box now. Come along, gentlemen, let's inspect our private gold mine. [CHATTERlNG ] [WOMAN SHOUTlNG ] Jeez, Ezra, you sure are right about this place. Excitement's over yonder. Hey, Buck. What's all the commotion? Poker. High stakes. Old Gundersson, he's losing his shirt, but he's not backing down. l think you better take a look at this. GUNDERSSON: l call. [CROWD GROANlNG ] Yeah, that's it. l'm wiped out, sure. You own the place. [WOMAN LAUGHlNG ] -Mother? -Hello, darling. l just won that sweet little hotel across the boulevard. [VlN GRUNTlNG ] CHRlS: Hey. [MEN GRUNTlNG ] YATES: Hold it! -No need for gunplay here. -l wouldn't be so sure. YATES: This ain't your fight, mister. -Who the hell are you? -Name's Yates. l'm a U.S. federal marshal. Vin Tanner. . . . . .you're under arrest for murder in the sovereign state of Texas. We've come to take you back. Let's go. Marshal Yates, all l'm saying is that a man's actions should speak for him. Couldn't agree more. But l got papers say. . . . . .this fellow Tanner's actions in Tascosa were that of a murderer. Just because some papers say it doesn't make it true. A lot of people will attest that Vin Tanner. . . . . .has risked his life many times to protect this town. Mrs. Travis, l'm not the judge and l'm not the jury. l'm not ever after that bounty on Tanner's head. l'm just a lawman sworn to bring him to trial for the killing of Jess Kincaid. Good afternoon, ma'am. Marshal, you ever heard of a man by the name of Eli Joe? Should l? He's wanted in Texas for the slaughter of two families. Well, what's that got to do with me? Tanner claims this Eli Joe set him up. You know that for a fact? Then what you have to say don't count for much. MARY: l'll wire the judge. You can do that, ma'am, but a territory judge. . . . . .don't have jurisdiction over this. You be careful with that sign. That cost a lot of money. MAN: We'll be careful. MAUDE: Bring it up on the left. Make sure that's well secured, now. That's it. That's good. That's good. World Famous Ritz. How optimistic. MAUDE: l have every reason to be, dear. So, tell me, Mother, which con did you use. . . . . .on our recently dispossessed Swedish friend? The floating king? You're very good at that one. There was no need to use sleight of hand. That man's dumber than a shovel. Well, what do you think? Frankly, of all the endeavors l thought you might undertake. . . . . .hotel proprietress was not one of them. Why are you in town? Well, l just wanted to be close to my sweet little baby boy. And look at you. l never thought you'd become a bartender. Owner, Mother. l've become a man of commerce. Madam. May l have the pleasure of welcoming you back to our humble town. Why, thank you. . . . EZRA: Josiah. -Josiah. You're as handsome as ever. lf eyes were meant for seeing, then beauty is its own excuse for being. EZRA: lf you'll excuse us, Josiah. Heartwarming family reunion and all. You understand. Oh, of course. [SlGHS] Honestly, Ezra, you've been as sour as a grape since l arrived. Perhaps that's because l have a distinctly uneasy feeling. . . . . .about you and l both owning businesses. . . . . .on the same street in the same town. Why ever for? Hey, it's not like we're in competition with each other. We're not, Ezra. l provide beds and baths and food for weary travelers. True, and l offer music, gambling and liquor. Well, there you are. Now, you make sure to secure that real well. MAN: Yes, ma'am. l don't want that toppling over on my patrons. Stupid. Stupid. How could l be so stupid? l got too wrapped up with this town and these people. l should've never quit hunting that bastard, Eli Joe, till l cleared my name. All those years of looking over your shoulder. . . . . .sleeping with one eye open. That's gotta wear on a man. That's no excuse. l let my guard down. Hey, you know me, Chris. l ain't afraid of dying. l just don't want to go out like that, strung up like some mangy dog. l ain't gonna let that happen. Oh, no. You go messing with a federal marshal, they'll string you up right alongside me. Chris. Larabee. Chris. Gentlemen, can you not picture this becoming. . . . . .the finest entertainment emporium in the entire territory? All l can picture right now is them fixing to take Vin away and hang him. Now, son, don't fret. Besides, when we rescue him we'll need a fitting place to celebrate. So, what say you, boys? Are you ready for success? NATHAN: l don't know, Ezra. My daddy used to say, ''Best horse you ever saw. . . . . .was as good as the man riding. '' Pure wisdom. Good morning, Luce. How have you been, Buck? l've missed you. All due respect, it doesn't look like you've been missing meals, there, Lucy. [LUCY GlGGLES] Well, it happens when you're going to have a baby. Hoo! -Sweet Lucy's gonna have a baby. LUCY: Uh-huh. -Congratulations. -Same as you. As me? Ha. You're the father, Buck. Hey, Buck and Lucy are having a baby. LUCY: And a wedding too. -What? Oh, my Pa's gonna insist on one. And you know how mad he gets. A wedding. Well, someone should buy a round of drinks. The Lord blesses the union of two lovers, glory to behold. No, no, this is nonsense, all right? lt's nonsense. l'm not the father of that baby. l'm not the father of that baby. l'm not about to get married. No, no. [LUCY SOBBlNG ] Well, Buck, it looks like it's time to get yourself a ring and a new suit. [LAUGHlNG ] Well? l've wired lawyers, courthouses. Anyone who would respond. From what l can tell, there's nothing to prevent them from taking Vin. What about Judge Travis? He's days away from a telegraph office. Marshal's right. He has no jurisdiction. Now, why don't we try going to Tascosa. Fight it there? The minute he steps foot in that town, they'll hang him. VlN: Wanna give me some of them beans? Might slow you all down if l'm going empty. [DEPUTY GRUNTS] Let's go! [VlN GRUNTlNG ] MAN: The hell you doing? MAUDE: Need ammonia and water. Mother, what are you doing? l'm redecorating. Yes, but poker tables? Selling liquor? l thought we had an understanding. Well, l found those gambling tables in the hotel cellar. Now, am l supposed to let those lovely furnishings. . . . . .languish in a dark and dusty hole? Don't start with me, Mother. l won't sit back and watch you take my business. Your business? Where in the city charter does it say. . . . . .that only you can serve drinks and offer gambling? You know what this means? A little war, dear? l'll run you into the ground. Well, we'll just see who buries whom. Well, then, the gauntlet is thrown. Good day. DEPUTY: Yeah, yeah. There you go. YATES: Come on. We can sit here and watch them take him if you want. l'm not. -They're federal marshals. -That's Vin Tanner, Miss Travis. -You're not taking him, marshal. -Kid. -l can handle this, Vin. -You gonna shoot us all, boy? No, just you. Let go of me, preacher. -Excuse the boy, marshal. -Head out, boys. Let's go. -No disrespect? -None taken. Come on. J.D. : You know he's innocent, Buck. -Chris is right. They'll see riders coming a mile away. Easier for one man to cut Vin loose. Chris. We'll be ready when you get back. JOSlAH: Hey, Chris. -Vin's? -Vin may be needing his gun. YATES: Come on. Hold up. Just in case you get any fancy notions. The war has begun. Complimentary. A special at the roulette wheel. All our numbers have. . . . Excuse me. Did l--? Gentlemen? [DRUMMlNG AND BELL RlNGlNG ] MAN: Four cents? All drinks four cents? [WOMAN SCREAMlNG ] MAUDE: Scat. Go away, you foul creature. [SKUNK CHlTTERlNG ] [MEN COUGHlNG AND SHOUTlNG ] MAN: Wow, this stuff is crap. Oh, boy. [EZRA GRUNTlNG ] How much did she pay you? Come back here, you coward! You haven't seen me. l haven't seen him. [LUCY CRYlNG ] A pleasure palace unrivaled anywhere in the world. CROUPlER: Place your bets, gentlemen. This is the last chance. J.D. : Thirteen, 1 3. Come on, 1 3. Come on, Mr. Croupier. Come on, 1 3. Come on, 1 3. Come on, 1 3. -Hello, Judas. -Oh, hey, Ezra. Thirteen. Thirteen! Listen, J.D., l just want you to know that despite your betrayal. . . . . .l'm holding you a spot in the investment. CROUPlER: Red seven is the lucky number. Damn! -For an initial buy-in-- -l can't believe it. l was winning. Ezra, l was winning. l had this system. lt was working. Would that be Maude's system, by chance? -Yeah, it was working great. -Until you got cleaned out. Damn! Well, Ezra, dear. Drop in for an ap?ritif? ''Physician on Premises''? Well, l thought it would be a nice amenity for the patrons. Dr. Jackson is fitting in very well. Dr. Jackson? He's not a doctor. Well, he should be. EZRA: Hey, Nathan. Get back here. You can't have Nathan. He's one of my investors. Funny, he didn't mention that when he signed on. Now, can we discuss this another time? l have a rendezvous. Afternoon, Maude. A woman like this renews a man's faith. ln what? Hi, Buck. Lucy? What are you doing in here? You're gonna have to leave. Not what you said last time we were in here. Hell, that was a long time ago. Oh, Buck. l've seen all that. You certainly don't have to be modest in front of me, of all people. l think l do now. -Lucy, we gotta talk. LUCY: Don't l know it. There are a thousand things to discuss. The honeymoon. Where we'll live. -Lucy-- -And baby names. l like Randolph for a boy, and Eudora for a girl. -What do you think? -What l think. . . . . .is that you can't see or hear anymore. There isn't going to be a place to live. There isn't gonna be a honeymoon. . . . . .because there isn't gonna be a wedding. Okay. And one other thing. No little girl of mine is gonna be named Eudora. [WOMEN GASPlNG AND GlGGLlNG ] VlN: l figure it's been a while since you boys were in Texas. YATES: That right? Yeah. Texas is thataway. Just shut up and ride. EZRA: Here we go, gentlemen. Here you go. Hey, l need me another drink over here. l was not made for honest labor. lNEZ: Then let me do it. Do what? Tend your bar. And clean and make repairs. Until you and l really get the place going. By then you'll make me your partner. Listen, se?orita. Uh, l am not looking for a partner. And you certainly cannot tend bar here. And you can? You see that gentlemen at the end of the bar? He'd eat you like half a sandwich. Would you care to bet? One dollar. l serve him. Any trouble, you win. Fine, be a dollar more than l made yesterday. lNEZ: What will it be? Well, now, ain't you just a pretty little frijole. l need me a rye whiskey. Comprende? S?, se?or. Now l need me a kiss. -Do you? MAN: Yeah. No kiss, no money. -l see. -Get ready for some heaven. There's your kiss. What's your name? lnez Rocios. Well, Se?orita Rocios. . . . . .welcome to your new job. All these men deputies too? Sure. Soon as l steal them some badges. VlN: Well, well. You're a long way from home, Eli Joe. Well, l figured l'd see some more of this beautiful country. Look up old friends. Hang him. Sure went to a whole lot of trouble not to face me alone. ELl JOE: You're thinking it's cowardly. l think it's smart. See, l know all about your six amigos. You all been making quite a name for yourselves around here. Real proud of yourself, ain't you? ELl JOE: Yeah, l suppose. But it had to be done. See, l haven't been sleeping too well ever since l pinned that murder on you. Your conscience bothering you? [CHUCKLlNG ] l ain't got a conscience. How about Jess Kincaid? You killed an innocent farmer just to frame me for murder. Got you off my trail, didn't it? This little voice inside keeps telling me. . . . . .Vin Tanner's gonna come looking for me. Settle out both scores. So l figured l'd find you first. l'm glad l did. Let's do this. Gotta get back on the trail. MAN: Take cover. YATES: Don't let him get away. Get him. What took you so long? l thought you might need this. Yah! Now, now. No need to rush in all at once. One at a time, if you please. Yes, you sir. A whiskey? Why, of course. Be my pleasure. This here's our finest single malt. Join you? l'd be honored. To your health, sir. [EZRA LAUGHlNG ] l have an idea. About what, a bank we can rob? About food. l think we should offer something to eat, like the hotel does. Try it. Muchas gracias, se?orita, but l am drinking my dinner. Have you lost your mind? The sign outside says drinks for a penny. What next? Pay people to come in here? My God, at this rate you'll be broke in no time. Well, isn't that the object of your little exercise, Mother? Might as well help it along. MAUDE: Oh, and that you have. l have just come from the bank. . . . . .where l discovered that you paid your own money. . . . . .to buy this glorified shack. Well, who else's money was l supposed to use? Somebody else's. Anybody else's. -Right. -Ezra, rule number one: Never run a deal on your own money. Lord, l thought l taught you better than that. What have all my efforts been for? [CHUCKLlNG ] Your efforts? Your efforts? [GLASS SHATTERS] Exactly what effort have you ever exerted. . . . . .that wasn't entirely self-serving? Children. Would you like to try some? Mmm. Muy bueno. For you, Daddy. BUCK: Oh, thank you, Eudora, my little pumpkin. You ready? [SlNGlNG ''HUSH LlTTLE BABY''] WOMAN: Wake up, Bucky. Wake up, Bucky. Oh, sorry, honey. l gotta go. l don't want to be late for work. Bye, honey. BUCK: Ohh. . . . JOSlAH: Go on in, Brother Buck. Sanctuary's always available for the troubled soul. l'm not troubled. What makes you think l'm troubled? Okay. Forget l said it. -Say, Josiah. -Yep. Have you ever thought about marriage? Well, animals mate. Plants grow, flowers bloom. Seems to be the natural order of things. Maybe that's it. lt ought to be natural. Right? lt's not something that's forced on you. JOSlAH: Exactly. Then again. . . . . .could be the fates sending you a blessing. BUCK: Yeah? Fine wife. The life of a child. Most men would live and die for that. Yeah. Well, tell me this. How do l know that Lucy is the one for me? l mean, l hardly know her. Seems to me that would be a good starting point. lf you want it. Well, what do you mean? Get to know the girl. Circled back two miles. Looks like they gave up on us. Probably fixing to break camp and get the hell out of here. lf they're smart, that's what they'll do. He ain't getting away this time. l'm gonna drag that murdering sack of dirt back to Texas. . . . . .and he's gonna tell the jury the truth. l don't know, Vin. The truth and Eli Joe don't seem a likely mix. l've lived with Kiowas and Comanches. l know a thing or two about getting the truth out of people. l look forward to seeing that. Too bad we gotta keep him alive. Since we do, we'd best get us some help. Come on. J.D. : Hey, Buck. Josiah. We gotta ride. Split them up. Everybody takes a man. Feller in the serape's mine. All right, boys, like we planned. VlN: Hold it right there. [MEN GRUNTlNG ] MAN: Don't shoot. Don't shoot. VlN: You're finished, Eli. Yates? Where is he? Where is he? l got no problem killing you. Won't change the fact he's gone. Took off early. Got a head start out of the territory. l guess he knew you were coming. [YATES GRUNTlNG ] l'm gonna find him, wherever he is. l think you'll find this room delightful. lt has a lovely view down Main Street, just as you requested. l call it the presidential suite. The very best appointments. l'm expecting new linens from the capital soon. ELl JOE: Oh, this is gonna do just fine. Well, you enjoy your stay, now. ELl JOE: Mm. NATHAN: Come on, move. Come on. CHRlS: Take him inside. MAN: Don't push. -l hear you're going after Eli Joe. -Yes, we are, ma'am. -How long will you be gone? -However long it takes. Way we figure, Eli Joe is just a day ahead of us. Where to first? -What's this all about? -Thought you could use some help. l'm much obliged. But my business with this man is mine and mine alone. Got no argument there. lt's just, it's awful big country out there, is all. We all ride, one of us is bound to cross his path. Mathematical certainty. You got a chance to finish this now. You may not get another one. Alrighty, then. Meet up at my wagon in 20 minutes. -Vin, good luck to you. -Thank you, ma'am. Twenty minutes? Long enough for a man to get to know someone. Right? [MAN LAUGHlNG ] [LUCY LAUGHlNG ] Buck! Uh. . . . Buck, honey. l think you can drop the ''honey'' part. Oh, Buck. l'm sorry. l sure never wanted you to find out about Luther this way. -Luther? -What? ls that your name, boy? -Well, yeah. BUCK: Luther? -You gotta understand, Buck. -What do l gotta understand? Luther is the father of my baby. But he wouldn't admit it. So l-- Well, l made a play for you, Buck. Oh, wait, are you telling me l was second choice to him? No, no, it was only a play to force his hand. So l wasn't any choice at all? Listen, mister, l love her and we're getting married. l couldn't stand by and watch her marry another, because-- Because she's, you know-- You know, and l'm-- BUCK: What, you--? -Not you. You sure got a way with words, there, Luther. Certainly do. [SlGHS] Thank you. [SCOFFS] ELl JOE: So long, bloodhound. [MAN SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] VlN: Howdy. Don't ask. CHRlS: Vin! [WOMEN SCREAMlNG ] Hold your fire! Hold your fire. Don't kill him. Surround the hotel! J.D. : Got you, Buck. VlN: Take him alive! [GASPlNG ] My presidential suite. l'll take the roof. J.D. : There. There he is. [VlN GRUNTS] [BOTH GRUNTlNG ] We've got some unfinished business in Texas. JOSlAH: All right. Take him away. l know you wanted him alive. You did what you had to. l can't clear my name if l'm dead. Well. . . . . .you win, Mother. You always do. Well, of course, darling. l've known you since you were an itty-bitty baby. That's always gonna be my trump card. That's a mother's advantage. Now, come here and give me a kiss before l leave. EZRA: You're leaving? But your place is a gold mine. lt's booming. Well, that's the whole idea. You buy a depressed property. You get it going. . . . . .and sell it at the height of it's popularity. l made a fortune. Spend it in good health, Mother. Oh, l already did. l reinvested it in another very depressed property. You aren't. You can't possibly be. Yes. The new owner of the Standish Tavern. Banks are delighted to sell paper on imminent foreclosures. Foreclosure? You don't have to thank me. l knew that you'd just about die with embarrassment. l just dropped by to make final arrangements. l can't leave without ensuring that my interests. . . . . .are looked after by someone l can trust. Oh, no. Never. l will never work for you. Fine, if that's your attitude. l'll find another bartender. Bartender? Then who's the manager? l came. l saw. l conquered. Wait. Just tell me one thing. Why? Why here? Why me? Somebody's got to keep you sharp, son. We're business people. And we're the best at what we do. Don't ever forget that. Yes, indeed. An amazing woman.
