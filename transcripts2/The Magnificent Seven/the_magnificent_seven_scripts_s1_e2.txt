 Buck, J.D. and Chris are in Wickestown, a tent town whose main resources are whiskey and women. When Buck sees one of the women being beaten by a man he steps in and Chris and J.D. must intervene as well. They ride off with Nora and it isn't long before the rest of the 'working girls' follow suit and leave Wickestown for the protection of the seven. This infuriates Wickes, the brutal man who runs Wickestown with an iron fist, and he will stop at nothing to get the women back.

 Tell Mr. James this store is not for sale. Get them on down. l must reduce my offer now. Some of your fixtures are busted. You tell him what he can do with his money! Coach gun. Sir. What you looking at? Go on, get out of here. Drop your gun belt. You don't know who l am, do you? No, and l don't care. Well, you're making a big mistake pointing that thing at me. Sawed-off coach gun...

 ...00 buck. Should cut all three of you in half. That stuff in there was self-defense. Wasn't it, boys? He's unarmed. You shot him twice. That's murder in my book. -Oren. -Get out of here, Mary. Please, be careful. l admire your courage, old man. But there's three of us and one of you. Hardly sounds fair. Nope. Well, howdy. Boys. You stay out of this, cowboy. This ain't your fight. Did he just call me a cowboy, J.D.? l think he did, Mr. Larabee. At least once. He hates that. No, l was just saying that it ain't your fight. Not yet. Drop the gun belt. Who the hell are you? New circuit judge. Oren Travis. You're under arrest, young man. -Now.... -l was there. l was standing right over there. l was standing there when they come riding in. l was standing right ...  Your letter said you had a full house. Where are the other prisoners? Sheriff let them go before he left town. Yeah, if you're smart, you'll let me go too. Well, l'm not smart. That's why you're gonna stand trial for murder. -My trial, your funeral. -You threatening me? This has become a dangerous territory, judge. His uncle is Stuart James. James raises cattle and thinks he and his friends run the territory. That's because they do. Not anymore. Don't be stupid, old man. This stupid old man... ...has hung 23 smart young men. Like yourself. Who's that man that backed me up? l want to thank him. He's a hired gun. Chris Larabee. What are you gonna do? l'm gonna get a drink and try and get a jury. All right. lll see how Mrs. Potters doing. l'm Judge Travis. l've come nearly 300 miles to bring some justice to this territory. Now, we're gonna have a trial here. We're gonna need 1 2 residents for a jury. Any volunteers? You? l.... l ... l'm sorry, judge. l have to live in this town. lsn't there one man here who wants to see justice done? l'd like ... l'd like to help, sir, but l got a farm to work. Crops ... Crops to get in. All right, the hell with it. l'll conduct a bench trial myself. What'll you have, fellas? Hey, cowboy. Join you? l was thinking about getting an early start for Tascosa. l was thinking about whiskey... ...a room, a bed... ...and more whiskey. Why don't you give it a few days. With this bounty on my head, l ain't got a few days. l never met a man who was in such a hurry to get himself hung. Chance l gotta take. Need to clear my name. l'm leaving in the morning. Wouldn't blame you if you preferred to stay. What are the women like in Tascosa? Don't come much livelier. See you in the morning. l knew it, Nathan. l knew with absolute certainty... ...that l was gonna meet my maker in that lndian village. We don't take care of that wound, you gonna get your wish. Look around you, Nathan. What do you see? l see people drinking. Lost souls, every one of them. You know what they need, don't you? They need me, damn it. And l need to change that bandage. Buck, you wanna give me a hand here? Over to my place? -Come on, man. -Come on, brother. Morning, Buck. lt's afternoon, Josiah. Don't tell me you have stairs. Only two flights. Put it on his tab. So everyone's going their own way. As well they should. -Good Lord. -All right. l got $20 for any man who wants to be sheriff. A week's work. All right, 30. l am deeply moved by this exhibition of courage. Sir? -l'd like the job. -No, you're too young. -l'm older than l look. -This job could kill you. l know. -There's no glory in it. -l'm not looking for any. Am l to believe that this is the only brave man among you? All right, you're hired. Ezra. l'm gonna be the sheriff. -Congratulations. -Ezra. Sheriff. Ezra. Do l know you, sir? Don't believe l've had the pleasure. Ezra Simpson, Ezra Smith? Oh, it was Fort Laramie. You jumped bail. Must've been someone else. l've never been to Fort Laramie. Oh, no. l never forget a face. Especially one l put away. You're under arrest. Young man, take his gun. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please. This is... ...obviously an unfortunate case of mistaken identity. Take his gun. lf my memory serves me correct... ...there's a little something up his sleeve too. -Don't do this, my friend. -Sorry, Ezra. l don't know you all that well, and apparently he does. Thanks for the vote of confidence. All right, take him to jail. Lock him up. l need me something like that. -He got Lucas locked up. -Who does? This new circuit-court judge named Travis. l heard he was coming. What'd my nephew do this time? He shot a store owner. Potter. Saddle my horse. They try to escape, shoot them. Well, sir, now that we are rid of that loathsome curmudgeon... ...you may effect my emancipation. Let me out. Nothing personal, Ezra. l can't. Just doing my job. That boy's done some stupid thing! Mr. Wilmington, at last. Someone of maturity to end my ordeal. Yeah, right. What is wrong with you, son? Bartender said you signed on as sheriff? l'm getting enough money to be called mister. -l hope they paid you in advance. -Shut up! Are you out of your mind? You're gonna get killed. l'll have to think of something nice to say at your funeral. -You mean you're capable? -Yeah, l'm capable. -l'll be fine, Buck. -l've seen your ''fine.'' Look what l found. Navy Colt .44. Don't do that, okay? lt could come loose, and then it could come out. Put the gun down. You're gonna be sheriff. -Yep. -You're gonna be sheriff. -Yeah, you're gonna walk tall! -That's right. Do something for me right now. Just get rid of the hat. You know, Bat Masterson wears a hat just like this one, Buck. Shoot, you're no Bat. You're not anything like any of them. -Well, l still ain't changing my hat. -Okay, that's fine. l'm just trying to give you a few pointers, okay? So you don't get yourself killed. All right? Now, l was a lawman once. You don't respect that, that's fine. -l understand. -Hey. -A badge. -A badge. lmagine that. A badge in a jail. That's something, isn't it? Do me a favor, would you? Just pin it behind your lapel. That way, you're not advertising. ln case someone is looking to shoot you. You okay? You all right down there? Don't get up. That's good. Sheriff. You have a good day, now, sheriff. l'll find my own way out. l'm almost done. Good, because l'm starving. Where shall we eat? We've only got one restaurant left open. Well, let's go there, then. My grandson's the smartest boy in his class, just like his father. He'd have been proud of him. l'm sure he would. You know, can you help me with this? Evie usually does it, but l never quite get the.... The boy misses you a lot, you know. l miss him too. He can't understand why you don't come and live with Grandma and me. l've explained that to him. Let's see what he wrote. ''This is Grandpa's house. There is a big room for you when you can come.'' Why don't you sell the paper and come home. This is my home. And besides, nobody wants the newspaper. Not with the town the way that it is. l was hoping once you got here, things would turn around. Then it would be safe enough for my Billy to come back and live with me. That'll take a long time. These people are scared. -Give them a reason not to be. -lt's hard to make changes... ...when you can't even raise a jury. Why don't you go ahead and get us a table, all right? l'll be along in a minute. -He's inside. -All right. -Menu, sir? -No, l'm not eating. l'd like to buy Judge Travis a bottle of champagne. No, nothing for me. l'll have another beer. My father raised cattle here. My sons will too. But we have to keep the homesteaders out. Keep their sheep from destroying our grazing land. We have a growing nation to feed. A destiny to fulfill. You help us do that, my friends and l will make you a rich man. Does your sense of destiny include the murder of an innocent man? l heard Lucas shot that storekeeper in self-defense. l was there. We get older, memory plays tricks on us. -lt was murder. -lf you don't let Lucas go... ...by noon tomorrow, there could be another one. l'm an officer of the federal court, you son of a bitch. You kill me and you'll have the whole damn Union Army come down on you. You should try the veal. lt's from my ranch. lt's very good. Good morning, lda. Good morning, Mary. Beautiful. lt's a beautiful day, isn't it, Mrs. Travis? -Yes, Mr. Wilmington. -Call me Buck. -Can l take these for you? -l've got them. Don't get ink on that pretty dress. Get your papers here! Read all about it! Oh, here you are, ma'am. lt's a little reading material. Hold on, sir. Paper. Don't run from me. Here you go. Hold on. Papers, right here. Get your papers. Ma'am, you got beautiful eyes. l know you'd like a paper. Here you are. l used to do this as a kid. ''Without justice, courage is weak.'' That's right. Have you thought about serving on the jury? -No, ma'am. l'm not a resident. -Well, what about Mr. Larabee? Well, like me, he just keeps moving on. -Unless there's something to stay for. -How long have you known him? l've known him a real long time, ma'am. l see you are likewise disenchanted by this establishment's fine cuisine. l'll eat lunch when l get out. Leaving so soon? Soon as my boys get here. l see. Can l interest you in a game of chance? What are your stakes? Well, let's just say that... ...if l win and your associates succeed in releasing you... ...you might just forget to lock the door behind you. And if l win? You can kill me. -Gloria. -Mary. -Mr. Larabee? -Ma'am? Your friend Buck told me you lost your wife and son in an accident. l lost my husband. l know something of what you've been through. No, ma'am. You don't. There he is. We want you to turn Lucas loose. l can't. He's gotta stand trial. We don't want a trial. Maybe it was self-defense. That's for the judge to decide. Look, don't be stupid, son. His men will come back for him. You want the whole town shot up, innocent people killed? Seems to me the prisoner is the one killing innocent people. Thought you'd wanna put an end to that. l can't believe you're talking like this, Mr. Conklin. My husband was a friend of yours. All of yours. And you're willing to just let his murderer go free. l'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Potter... ...but there's no reason to see more people killed. lf you don't turn the prisoner loose, we'll release him ourselves. Try it. You'll be wearing a coffin tomorrow, mister. Stand aside. Come on, he won't shoot us. You got a problem here, sheriff? We don't want your kind in this town. You bring nothing but trouble. Can't be worse than what you already got. Sorry, Mrs. Potter. Thanks. And these two little fillies... ...they looked better walking away from a man... ...than they did walking towards him. And this golden hair smelling like sage just tumbling down their backs... ...to this sweet buttermilk ...  My past is my own, Buck. lt's not something you can use for conversation. She asked. Guess you didn't hear me. l hear you. And l'm sorry, Chris, but what the hell... ...am l supposed to say when people ask? Nothing. I want you to get some witnesses. Do it at gunpoint if you have to. Anyone who saw the shooting. l'll do it. l'm sorry, judge. Nobody. Nobody'll do it. Guess you're gonna have to let me go, huh? And we got company coming. Court is now in session. The Honorable Oren W. Travis presiding. lt's about damn time. Set it up, Billy. Saloon is closed, gentlemen. That's too bad. l really need a drink. Gun belts on the bar. Come on. Gun belt ...  Sounds like it came from the saloon. Get the damn keys there. No, don't shoot him! He's a federal judge. Give me a gun. Let me do it. J.D.! Get Nathan. Be careful! J.D., get down! Ma'am, l'm gonna need your help. How's he doing? The Honorable Oren Travis is a stubborn old man. Yeah, l noticed that. Hope he'll be all right. You're leaving? Yeah. Take my advice. This town ain't fit for a woman. Listen, Mr. Larabee. When my husband was killed... ...l swore on his grave l would not become a victim. And that his dreams, everything we worked so hard for... ...they wouldn't be taken away from us. lt's all l have left to give to my son. And l'll fight anyone to make sure that that happens. All right. As long as you know what you're getting yourself into. A man like James, he don't care about nothing or nobody but himself. You get in his way, he'll walk right through you. Your little boy already lost his father. l'd hate to see him lose his mama too. Mrs. Travis. Couple of James' boys are over in the saloon asking about the judge. -Wondered if he's still alive. -They're just waiting for him to die. Maybe it's better if he does. Oh, my Lord. What'd you put in here? -Rocks. -You didn't have to put so many in. lt had to look right. They still out there? Yeah. -Shouldn't we say something? -Say something? -Like some words? -lt's a coffin full of rocks, J.D. l know, l put them there. But shouldn't we look like we're doing something? -You know, maybe a prayer? -He'd appreciate that. l know l would. Where am l? A room l rent. You're safe. How long l been sleeping? Day. Anyone else get hurt? Nobody you care about. Where's Mary? -l'll get her. -No, hold off. l wanna talk to you. l never got a chance to thank you for backing me up the other day. But that kind of behavior could get you killed. l had a son killed. And on the days when l really miss him... ...l wonder if it was worth it. He's the only one who would know. You ever been shot? lt gets your attention. Makes you think... ...what do you believe? What do you believe in, Mr. Larabee? Not as much as l used to. From what l can see... ...more than most. l have to choose my fights carefully these days. Save any souls yet? You look downright handsome in that thing, Chris. Thank you for the going-away present, Josiah... ...but l'm not leaving. l got a little situation. Situation. This ain't another one of those 6-1 odds kind of thing, is it? No, l don't think so. l'm figuring more like 1 0-1 . Sure know how to lead a man into temptation, don't you? We leave now. What do you say, doc? Well, l always did recommend a little fresh air and exercise. You did. l thought you and Vin were going to Tascosa. lt'll keep. Besides, that Lucas fella owes me a new hat. You can count me out, because l decide to commit suicide... ...l'll do it myself, all right? Come on, gal! Like l said, you can always count on Buck. Yep. Mr. Larabee. Might l assume you've come to take me with you? Oh, l couldn't do that. May l ask why? You broke the law. You've been a bad boy. l know where Lucas went. You do? Yes, sir. So do we. Well, great. But he likes me. l can get us in. You try walking in there, you'll just get yourself shot. You ran out on me once before. You wouldn't be thinking about doing that again, would you? l swear upon the grave of my sainted mother. Now, you told me your mother was still alive. Figure of speech. Figure you're dead if you're lying. Looks like a few more than we planned on. How many more? The word ''regiment'' mean anything to you? Would you like to come back when there are less of them? We come this far. Seems a shame not to go. Let's do this. -All right, now, have a good fight. -ln the belly! ln the belly! All right. Yeah! Give those boys a hand. Let me help you with your load, brother. Can you handle it? Like licking butter off a knife. Here's to you. Easy. Lucas, my dear friend. You so discourteously left me behind. Hey, how'd you get out? l played poker with that boy pretending to be a sheriff. He lost. Listen, l have something of a delicate nature to discuss with you in private. Let's get you a drink, then. Would you courtesans excuse us for just a moment, please? See you girls in a little bit. My money's on the fat one. -So, what's on your mind? -l was just wondering... ...how big a hole do you think a .45-caliber slug can make? l remember you. lt's nice to be remembered. Start walking and we won't kill you. Hey, Lucas. Lucas! Where are you going? We're just going out for a little ride. Lucas decided to go with us. Do l know you? All you need to know is there's a man on that balcony... ...with a rifle pointed at your head. This a personal matter? Not yet. -l'll double what you're getting. -You know, Mr. James... ...there's some things money can't buy. Enjoy yourselves. Stop them! Stop. Don't anybody move. Nice gun. Can l have it? Let them go. -Who are you? -Doesn't matter. Nice party. Get him. There ain't nobody up here! Come on! Get after them! Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here. -Let's go! -Come on! They're gaining! J.D.! l thought l told you to take care of the horses! l couldn't take care of all of them! -Good thing l came along. -Good thing you did. Hey. Hey. Hey! What are you doing, bringing him back here? He's gonna stand trial for murder. How? The judge is dead. l'm afraid the news of my death was a bit premature. These men risked their lives to bring this man to justice. l want 1 2 good men who give a damn... ...about this town to step forward and see justice done. l'll do it, judge. Us too. Court convenes in 1 0 minutes. Take the prisoner to the jail. You heard him. Kind of hoping you gentlemen would consider... ...sticking around for 30 days. Keeping an eye on things until l get back. l'd be willing to pay. -How much? -Dollar a day. Room and board. How about you, young sheriff? You willing to take a cut in pay? l'm in, if everyone else is. lt's a pity that l, as a convicted felon... ...will be unable to lend my services. Well, how about if you got a pardon? Where do l sign? A man could stay pretty busy in a town like this. l figure if you men are gonna be getting shot... ...l might as well stick around. A few women around here l'm not acquainted with. You in the back there, you interested? Got some things need taking care of. But l guess they'll keep. -Chris? -l have a feeling l'm gonna regret this. l got seven, huh? l want you to know that l appreciate what you gentlemen did. So do l. Court is now in session.
