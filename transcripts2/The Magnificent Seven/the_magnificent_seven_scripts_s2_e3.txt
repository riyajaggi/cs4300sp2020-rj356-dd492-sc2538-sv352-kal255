 EZRA: Need a card? -No. -Thank you, lnez. -Welcome. Thank you. -Whoa. -Sorry. You could at least serve a smile with that splash. lf you want a smile, se?or, try tipping. Do you want a really good tip? Let me buy you a drink some time. Hmm, let me think about that. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH AND THEN LAUGHTER] lt means never. Devil himself doesn't get burned that bad.

 Lady's been here in town a mere two weeks. . . . . .and she sees through you like a pane glass window. l say that Buck has met his match. l fold. [BUCK CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me, lnez. l don't speak much Spanish, but to me, nunca sounded a lot like. . . -. . . ''tonight. '' -Then let me translate. Never. lt sure is a pretty spot, Chris. VlN: Though l never figured you for the settling kind. Well, l wouldn't say l'm settling down. Just looking for a little peace and quiet. -Can't argue with that. -Thanks for the supplies.

 [SAW GRlNDlNG ] [HORSE WHlNNlES] [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] -Hot day, no? -l suppose. [HORSE SNORTS] Poor Alonzo here lost his horse just an hour ago. She passed maybe three miles back. DON PAULO: Now Alonzo has nothing to ride. Maybe he can ride yours. -That horse ain't for sale. -Alonzo. What are you gonna do about this? [ALONZO GRUNTS] [GUNSHOT] Bravo, se?or, ha-ha-ha. lt seems Alonzo will have to find a horse elsewhere. Get off my property. [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] Perhaps we will meet again. -Go on. -Come on. Hyah! So much for peace and quiet. My father says you're the fastest gun there is. Now l see this man, l'm not so sure, Raphael. l am faster, Don Paulo. DON PAULO: Then you will have to prove it. By killing him. After we have lnez. [HORSE SNORTS] EZRA: Where're you going, Buck? Nunca sounded an awful lot like, ''tonight. '' Let me translate for you, Buck. EZRA & NATHAN: Never. -Oh, hell. lt wasn't that funny. -lt was rapturous, Buck. -Ha-ha-ha. l never imagined you'd lose your touch so fast. At least you got a chance to learn how to speak Spanish. Now, hold on. Buck Wilmington never says never. Now that l've put my mind to it. . . . . .that girl's, ''never,'' is gonna turn into a ''yes'' . . . . . .faster than a jackrabbit with its tail on fire. l say that rabbit's already cooked, Buck. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] Check the boarding houses, the livery, the cantina. lf lnez is here, find her. Maybe she's gone already, huh? Then we'll find out where she went and follow her there. To hell and back if necessary. [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] J.D. : Gonna be a scorcher today. Hotter than a burnt boot. CASEY: Hot enough to wither a fence post. [LAUGHlNG ] Hot enough to sunburn a horned toad. lt'll be so hot we'll have to put the chickens on ice. . . . . .to keep them from laying hard-boiled eggs. lt's gonna be so damn hot that. . . . . .that if man died here and went to hell, he'd feel like writing home for a blanket. CASEY: l got one! -Get it! Get it! Pull it in. -l can't. lt's really big. -lt looks like a big one. J.D. : Pull it in. Pull it in. Get it. -l'll get it. [J.D. GRUNTS AND THEN CASEY LAUGHS] Biggest fish l ever saw. [J.D. SHOUTS AND THEN CASEY SCREAMS] [J.D. SHOUTlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY] [CASEY SHRlEKlNG AND LAUGHlNG ] J.D. : Come here. [BOTH PANTlNG ] l guess we better get on back. -Yeah, maybe you're right. -l got some chores to see to. Come here. DON PAULO: Alonzo. -Don Paulo. lt's my shooting arm. A doctor could fix it. We must talk first. [DON PAULO MUTTERS] Don Paulo, is something wrong? [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] l have a horseman with no horse. A gunman who can no longer shoot. A once useful man, now useless. [ALONZO GRUNTS] You disgrace my family. Guillermo, take him away. TONY: Howdy, Chris. -Thanks, Tony. [RAPHAEL SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] l am Raphael Cordova de Martinez. My patron's son, Don Paulo. . . . . .has asked me to kill you. Well, l appreciate the warning. l would have liked to see more of your work. -My work? -With the gun. You are very impressive. Almost as good as me. l suppose l'll just have to take your word for that. [RAPHAEL SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] Do you feel like dying today? l feel like today is just as good as any other. Who knows what the day will bring. [CHATTERlNG ] -What you looking at, J.D.? -Oh, hey, doc. -l'm thinking of getting this for Casey. -What is it? -lt's a frog gigger. -Ha-ha. You're gonna buy the girl a frog gigger? -Why? What's wrong with that? -Oh, come on, now. You ought to get her that nice bracelet there. Huh? l don't know about a bracelet. Well, ask an expert. Miss Travis. . . -. . .J.D. is buying a present for his girl. -My girl? Now, if you was her, what would you want? -The long or the short answer? -Short. Flowers, chocolates, maybe a token of love. Love? And the great city of Troy lays in ashes. All for the wooing a woman. [JOSlAH MURMURS] -What? -Huh? -The-- -Oh, IIiad. A battle of courtship like so many millions of others. . . . . .that have laid waste to men's souls. My own included. Hey, Josiah, that book got any, uh, pointers for someone who might. . . . . .be, uh, thinking about courtship? No. But you tell me your troubles, l may be able to help. All l'm saying is you got the wrong picture. Today with the guys, that wasn't me. This here is me. How do l know that the ''you'' here, is the one telling the truth? Would this face lie? -Like a wet rug, se?or. -Oh, ha-ha. Hey, l don't want to go to feuding words with you, the name is Buck. Well, in the battle of wits, Se?or Buck, l think you'd be unarmed. All right. But do you think there's anything wrong with a little mutual surrender? -You have a mouth, se?or. -Oh, and so do you. Maybe they should get together sometime. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] ls that a yes? Hey, hey. We were just getting on real friendly. -Se?or, l must go. BUCK: Why? lnez. . . . . .l've been looking for you. -Please, leave me alone. -Oh, we have many things to discuss. -Many things. -l have nothing to say to you. -She said she's got nothing to say. -No, Raphael. Y'all got a lot to learn about showing respect to a lady. Buck, please. -You've made some new amigos, l see. -No, no, he is no one to me. -l wonder. BUCK: You know what, mister? What's between the lady and me, it's got nothing to do with you. BUCK: So best you just walk away. You call her a lady, se?or, but she is nothing but a thief. [lNEZ SCOFFS] She has offended the honor of my family. Well, then that should make it real easy for you to just walk away. -Buck, please stop this. -You insult me, se?or. l'm just warming up. Touch that woman again. . . . . .and you're gonna see a real insult. What the hell's going on here? -Are you challenging me? lNEZ: No, he isn't. -Oh, l reckon l am. -Easy now, Buckley. Oh, this man wants a fight, he's got it. Right now. No, se?or, l demand satisfaction in the customs of my people. We meet at 1 :00 in the street to discuss the terms of engagement. You better pack your bags, lnez. You'll be coming home soon. [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] DON PAULO: Guillermo, watch her until this is over. -What have you done? -l'm not afraid of him. You should be. lNEZ: Leave me alone, Guillermo. You ain't following the lady to her room. lNEZ: Thank you. VlN: You all right? lNEZ: l'm leaving. They can't fight over a woman if that woman is not here. -Where you gonna go? -l'll find a new town. Start over. -You sure that's what you want? -l had a new life here. New job, new people. Now what choice do l have but to move on? Wherever you are, he'll find you. l know. What would you do? With people like Don Paulo, sooner or later you got to make a stand. Then l'll make my stand here. You hear that, Guillermo? l'm not leaving! Go tell that to your boss. Better get used to seeing me. You know, Buck, l've known you 1 0 years. . . . . .you see a woman, and your brain drops below your belt. Now, l thought we've known each other 1 2 years. -Why are you doing this, Buck? -Because he asked for it, Chris. -You're giving him what he wants. -l'm going to take him. He's prettier than a heifer in a flower bed. That ain't no reason. Ah, well, how about l got a reputation to defend? You're willing to take a man's life, put your own on the line for your reputation? l am standing up for what is right. Now, you'd do the same. -That's your pride talking. -No, that's me talking! Someone's gonna get killed because you're not man enough to walk away. Let me tell you something. Why don't you take your own advice and walk away. -All right, Buck. -All right. l can't believe Buck would go this far for a woman. A woman can get a powerful hold on a man. That's for sure. So l guess we should hold off on that courting stuff then, huh, Josiah? J.D., nothing you do can change what's gonna happen to Buck. JOSlAH: Now, what you want to do is focus on the heart's lighter side. The, uh, poetry of talking to a lady, the grace of a tenderhearted glance. . . . . .the mystery of that first kiss. Courtship can also be expensive, my friend. Fortunately, you now have an opportunity to place a small wager. . . . . .on Buck's upcoming contest. l'm giving even odds. . . . . .so y'all best act expeditiously. You taking bets on Buck's fight? l am merely providing a service for interested parties. EZRA: l've seen Mr. Wilmington handle a pistol. l have every confidence our Buck will prevail. lf however, some ignorant gudgeons choose to think otherwise. . . . . .who am l to insist they keep their money? [CHUCKLES] Yet l share your dismay at today's public demand for entertainment. Why, it calls to mind the decline and fall of Rome, which-- Ezra, shut up. Don Paulo. l have been asking questions. This man and his friends are gunfighters. They have a reputation around here. People call them ''Los Magnificos. '' Magnificos? American cowboys. Puffed chests. Big talk. No doubt, but there are seven of them. Four of us. Only three. Alonzo is gone. lt is unfortunate, but he was a coward. Your father would not approve. He does not need to, because l am patron here! You work for me, yes? Yes? [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] [ROOSTER CROWS] l'm nervous too. You know, maybe you shouldn't come with me, Josiah. Don't worry about that, kid. Now, you, uh, know what you're gonna say? Yeah. ''Good afternoon, Casey. Horse ride sublime, under the-- Under the, uh. . . . '' -Waning. -Waning. Stay. Good afternoon, Casey. Horse ride sublime, under the waning afternoon sun. Horse ride sublime, under the-- -Hey, J.D. J.D. : Waning. Raining? lt's not raining. Uh, of course. l mean um, horse ride sublime-- What? -What the heck's wrong with you? -Uh, nothing is wrong with me. l'm just trying to do this proper, is all-- -Do what? Talk through your sock? -You mind being quiet so l can do this? ls that Josiah over there? Look, l'm trying to ask you something. Take your foot out of your mouth and tell me what you want! What l want is for you to go on a danged ride with me! Why didn't you just say so? Four o'clock, this afternoon? Well, l thought that went real good, don't you? -l have no idea what l just said. -J.D., fly's open. [J.D. GROANS] Chris. Well, is Buck gonna go through with this? -Yeah. -Good. Come 1 :00, that Don is gonna get dusted. l mean, you know what l am saying is that Buck's gonna take-- He's not gonna shoot me in the back, J.D. Just what l was looking for. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] Now you can leave. You're against Buck Wilmington. You're against me. Who the hell do you fellas think you are, anyway? We are men who value integrity more than insolence. ls this chiquito as fast as you, se?or? Why don't you find out for yourself, se?or? Whoa, J.D., let's go get some air. Go on. lnez? l'm sorry. l didn't mean to interrupt you. Do you need anything? l just want people to know that l didn't mean for this to happen. l never thought Don Paulo would follow me here. Why did he? l'm a thief. You've heard, no? Yes. But that's not all that happened. [MURMURS] ln the town where l'm from, l used to work for Don Paulo's father. A wealthy man. Hard, but fair. Don Paulo, his son, wanted me, but l did not want him. Last month at a feast, he got drunk. He dragged me out in the middle of the town square. He pulled me by my hair like a dog and threw me to the ground. He was going to force himself on me. l grabbed the first thing l could find, a broken bottle. l cut Don Paulo's neck with it and l ran. Yes. . . . . .l took a horse to get away. That is my crime. Now every time Don Paulo looks at himself. . . That's why he's here. l'm so sorry. Se?ora, l did not ask Se?or Buck to do what he's done. lnez, don't underestimate Buck or his friends. When my husband was killed, l was left alone with a son and a business. . . . . .a whole town growing around me. l knew that l wanted to be a part of it all, but l just couldn't do it alone. Buck and the others, they helped me so many times. These men aren't like Don Paulo. You can trust them. [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] l have decided on the terms of engagement. You have until tomorrow morning, 8:00, to prepare for the fight. DON PAULO: And you will need this. What the hell are these? The only instruments for a man of honor. Now, you hold on there, Fancy Pants. Nobody said anything about swords. Now, around these parts, a fight is a gunfight. DON PAULO: No, se?or. You challenged me. The choice of weapons is mine. Says you. Now, what if l say no? lf you admit defeat, the woman is mine. -l shall take her and we shall leave. -That ain't gonna happen. l regret it will. [lNEZ SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] This man is no sword fighter. The choice is his. We'll figure another way out of this, Buck. Stand down. DON PAULO: Well, se?or? Well, they're just long butter knives. BUCK: We'll wear out our boots before we do any damage with those. We meet tomorrow morning. lnez. [BUCK GRUNTlNG ] [JOSlAH SlGHS] This isn't so bad. Allow me. -No, thank you. BUCK: All right. EZRA: Well, hello, old friend. When did you learn how to fight with a blade? l have on occasion found it necessary to defend my good name. . . . . .on the field of honor. Although l admit it's been a while since l held an ?p?e. -l can believe that too. NATHAN: lt's called a rapier. What's the difference? ?p?es and foils have points, but not edges. Rapiers have both, you can pierce and slash. Well, you obviously learned the sword's various manifestations. . . . . .but have you also studied its applications? Do you mind explaining how you acquired this expertise? Well, it's not something l like to think on. Years ago, back on the plantation. . . . . .the master, Mr. Jackson, he made me into his sparring partner. We fought with bare blades, so l had to learn quick. No offense, Ezra. . . . . .l think l'm switching teachers. Sure is a lovely day. Look at all this snow. -Nice day, huh? -J.D., where are you? What? Oh, uh, l was just thinking about that fight with Buck and that guy. Maybe you'd be more comfortable back in town, then, huh? l didn't mean it like that. l like riding with you. Sure must like lnez a lot to go and fight for her. Just met her. That's Buck, the fool. Ain't so foolish if you really feel something for a person. l suppose not. lf l were lnez, and you were Buck, would you fight for me? Not with no damned sword, l wouldn't. CASEY: Hyah! [HORSE WHlNNlES] May l sit with you, my Don? ''Your Don?'' Don Paulo, l wish to go home with you. l was a fool to turn you away. l see. Let us leave tonight. Now if you wish. So that l will not kill your Americano tomorrow? -Pleading for the life of your lover? -No, he's not my lover. Am l to allow him to live and have you forever wanting to return to him, huh? l just met this man. And now you will bid him farewell. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] Don Paulo, please don't do this. ln the name of your father, do not! l will do what l please! VlN: No, lnez. [GUNSHOT] -That ain't the way. -You've served me well, se?or. After all, l want lnez alive when l take her home. You'll be dead long before she goes anywhere with you. Guillermo. lt is time. Go. Raphael, you will watch lnez tonight. Guillermo will be busy. [GRUNTlNG ] [BUCK GROWLS] Defense, Buck. You gotta keep him away and wear him down. l still got to stick him with it to win, don't l? [BUCK YELLS] To stick him with it, you have to keep hold of it. -You understand? -Yeah. -Pick it up. -All right. [BUCK SlGHS] Concentrate. -Yes! -Yeah! Ha! [CHATTERlNG ] lsn't this a little beneath you? Following a woman around, spying on her? l serve the house of Madera. Sometimes serving the son is not the same as serving the father. We make our own beds. l owe Don Paulo's father my life. Does that mean doing everything this boy tells you to? lt means l do what is required. Se?or. . . . . .this fight, it's not about you. lt is now. You cannot beat Don Paulo. And if l stand aside and l let him take you, what kind of man would l be? One that is alive. lNEZ: lf not, you will make me responsible for your death. -l can not live with that. -Let me tell you something. l don't know this Don of yours, but l have met men like him. BUCK: l see it in his eyes. What he's got planned for you. . . . . .is a living hell. BUCK: You tell me l'm wrong. . . . . .and l'll walk away. lf that has to be my destiny, it is mine alone. Well, l just can't live with that. Tomorrow, l fight that man. [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] [DON PAULO CHUCKLES] Se?or, that is Pico Chavez. A man who never forgets a debt. Don Paulo. . . . . .men of honor do not associate with murderers and thieves. Raphael, those Magnificos intend to interfere and l will not allow it. [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] [HEART BEATlNG RAPlDLY] [MURMURlNG ] [GUNS COCK] No! BUCK: J.D. BUCK: lt was like l was still there. Seminole village, the colonel. . . . And his sword, when he. . . . Do you think it's a sign? JOSlAH: Yeah, it's a sign. lt's a sign you're scared. Fear is a part of who we are, Buck. Every time we go into a fight. . . . . .l know there's a piece of me wonders if l'm gonna come through it. l can feel it, in my hands, in my head, in my gut. No gunfight ever made me feel like this. Well, that's all right. God gives you fear, because fear helps you fight. God wants you to fight, because he wants you to live. So do you think this, uh-- This dream's a sign that l'm gonna win? Unless it's your time to die. [HORSE WHlNNlES AND CHlLDREN CHATTERlNG ] See all these people gathering to see Buck's fight? Not all of them. Pico Chavez's gang. [CHATTERlNG ] Don't imagine they're here to take a hot bath, either. JOSlAH: God is with you, Buck. lf you keep him away, you can wear him down. lf you attack, he'll kill you. Right. -Chris. -l know we don't always. . . . . .see things eye to eye, but l stand by you. All right. You ready? Not even close. VlN: We got company. lNEZ: lt is a custom. For luck. Will you do me the honor of holding my hat? After l have had my satisfaction. . . . . .my men and l will leave. l will take the woman. . . . . .and no one will interfere. [GUNS COCK] l will never go with you alive. Alter this, se?orita, you will do whatever l want. Remember, Buck, defense, okay? No lunges, no charges. Make him come to you. -All right. -You understand? Yeah. Stop all the preening and let's get on with this. [BUCK YELLlNG ] -No! MAN 1 : Let's go, Buck. [BUCK GRUNTlNG ] Keep away from him, Buck. Defense! MAN 2: That a boy. MAN 3: Get him, Buck. No. NATHAN: Get away from him. Good. Good. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERlNG ] Very impressive, se?or. -l see you have been practicing. -Just like whipping a mule. NATHAN: Come on, Buck. No. Come on, Buck. Defense. Keep away from him. Now l think you will not move so well. Come on, Buck. -We can end this right now. -No! [BUCK GROANS AND THEN MARY GASPS] [BUCK GRUNTlNG AND THEN GROANlNG ] [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] [GASPlNG ] [DON PAULO SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH AND THEN GUlLLERMO HOWLS] No! Guillermo! Shoot them! [GUlLLERMO GRUNTS] Raphael. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] Morning, gentlemen. VlN: J.D., heads up! You don't deserve it. . . . . .but you leave now. . .and you can live. lnez! Buck! [CROWD GASPS] [DON PAULO GRUNTS] Fate's looking kindly on us today, don't you think, J.D.? -Well, we're all still alive. -Yes, sir. And did fortune smile on you and your beIIe amour last evening? lf she ever talks to me again. Well, then, let me give you a piece of advice. What you want to do is buy that girl a frog gigger. [HORSE WHlNNYlNG ] l could grow fond of a place like this, se?or. But after today, Don Paulo's father will put a price on my head. Where will you go? Perhaps l will find six compadres of my own. -Care to join me? -Who knows what tomorrow brings? [RAPHAEL SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] J.D. : Hey, fellas. Still, it is too bad for you and me. Now we will never know who is the faster. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] [LAUGHS] You needed a new one, anyway. You're gonna have to take it easy for a while. Some of those cuts went deep. Don't you worry, Nathan. l'll be hanging up the sword for a while. -You did good. Mm-hm. -Thank you, sir. Hey, Ezra, l hear you won some money off of me. l get a piece of that? You, uh, care to fight me for it? Hey! [NATHAN LAUGHS AND BUCK GROANS] Se?or Buck. . . . . .it would be wrong for me not to thank you for all you've done. So. . . ...gracias. -Oh, l bet that was hard for you to say. -You have no idea. Ha-ha-ha. Well, se?orita, l accept your thanks. But if you really want to make it up to me. . . . . .how about you and me doing something tonight? How about right now? Uh. . . . [BUCK GRUNTS] [LAUGHlNG ] Now we're even. [LAUGHTER] Well, all right.
