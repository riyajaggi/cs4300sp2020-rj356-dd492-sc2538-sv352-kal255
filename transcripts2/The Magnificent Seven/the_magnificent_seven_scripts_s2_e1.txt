 EZRA: Get up. JOSlAH: Peaceably now. EZRA: Come on now. VlN: Move it. You picked the wrong town to mess with. BUCK: Get on. VlN: Get over there. Get up. Hey. Get up. Get. BUCK: Hiding behind a woman. What kind of man are you? Get on. Get on. Murdering pack of thieves. Rode into the wrong town, didn't you? You boys are looking at a stiff neck and a short drop. JOSlAH: Easy there, sergeant. -They killed my driver and left me to die. They stole my artillery wagon. Where's my artillery wagon, you bastards?

 Loaded wagon should be easy tracking. You volunteering? You paying? Five dollars. You'll get your wagon back, then. l'll get a unit together and haul these dogs away for you. What did they do to my store? MAN: Coach coming in. Chris. -Chris. Chris. MARY: Billy, wait. BlLLY: Chris. You all right? -Grandpa. TRAVlS: Billy, my boy. BlLLY: Grandpa. TRAVlS: How are you, huh? MARY: Judge. We weren't expecting you. l got a trial in Watsonville. l gotta leave in a couple of hours. Billy boy, you're growing so fast. -What the hell happened here? -lt's all been taken care of, judge. TRAVlS: Billy, how's school going? -Gentlemen. l'll have your guns, please. Who the hell is this? Federal Marshal Walter Bryce. He's the new law in town. BUCK: You better be prepared to fight. That's the way you're gonna get them. lf it comes to that, so be it. You don't want it to. Without us, you got no backup. Except the good Lord. . . . . .and he's got lousy aim. You must be the defrocked priest. l know about you. All of you. And l know about your arrangement with the judge. Well, then l guess you know what you can do with your policy. l know this all seems rather abrupt, but l'm a reasonable man. l'm going to give you 24 hours to comply. After which. . . . . .you leave town, check your guns, or go to jail. Well, how very reasonable. ln the meantime, if you'll excuse me. . . . . .l have work to do. VlN: You care to explain this to us, judge? Railroad's pressuring folks back in Washington. They're gonna start laying some tracks through here. . . -. . .and they want it to be safe. -We're already safe. The cattle ranchers are on the run. We got settlers coming in all the time. TRAVlS: l already told them all that. But the railroads want to ensure that they have badge out here. Someone official. Lot of good ''official'' will do when all those bullets start flying. Marshal's been doing things his way for years. Got a rock-solid reputation for cleaning out rough towns. . . -. . .back in Kansas. -This ain't Kansas. Time was when l could have stopped it. With the railroads pulling the all strings. . . . And l might add, a mess like this isn't gonna help you any. l gotta catch that stagecoach if l wanna have time. . . . . .to have a visit with my grandson. Nothing more l can do. l'm sorry. Judge, you pay us to protect this town. How you expect us to do it without guns? TRAVlS: l don't. You're relieved of your duties, as of now. Well, we're not gonna take this, are we? Where did Chris go? lt seems Marshal Bryce is here to stay. CHRlS: Yeah. l suppose a town can never have too many peacekeepers. Why do l get the feeling our new marshal doesn't agree with you? Well, Bryce may not want you here, but the people of this town do. All right, not everybody, but-- l've been here long enough as it is. So, what will you do now? l got some unfinished business l've been putting off. Take care of that. Billy will miss you. Mary? Would you say goodbye for me? Yeah. J.D. : So, Nathan. . . . . .are you staying? l'm all this town's got in the way of a doctor. May be no more guns, but there's still other ways for people to get hurt. Good. Good. That's good. That's really good. Buck. Hey, Buck, you thinking about sticking around? You couldn't drag me out with an eight-horse team. You're gonna go head-to-head with Bryce on this gun thing? J. D., do you see that little filly sitting in the corner, over there? Now, that is the only person l plan. . . -. . .on going head-to-head with. -You've been working on Millie. . . -. . .for three months. BUCK: Exactly. And in a few minutes. . . . . .all that hard work is gonna pay off. -Buck's staying. BUCK: Hey. Vin, Ezra, you sticking around? As for myself, l'm a few well-played poker games away. . . . . .from owning this saloon. And with no guns in town, there shall be fewer ways. . . . . .for disgruntled losers to seek reprisal. There's always tar and feathers. J.D. : Vin, how about you? Well, l figure it's a matter of time. . . . . .before that marshal finds my name on a wanted poster. Tell him you were framed. lt's about time you cleared that up. l aim to, kid. Right after l track down the sergeant's artillery wagon. Artillery wagon? Well, maybe l'll go with you. l don't believe he invited you, son. [HAMMERlNG ] Well, J.D. what oracle of wisdom has our new marshal revealed? ''By order of the marshal, a curfew shall be enforced at 1 1 p.m. . . . . .after which time there shall be no loitering, no imbibing of alcohol. . . . . .no gambling. Effective immediately. '' [GLASS SHATTERS] ''No spitting, no open fires, no open liquor bottles. '' lt's about time. POTTER: No seven men to watch over us. And l say, good riddance. We're moving into a modern age. What do we need with a bunch of gunslingers? Some show this morning, J.D. Of course, your riding got a little clumsy. You gonna start in on that ''l'm better than you'' junk? Because l ain't in the mood. So it's true? You seven are breaking up? We are not breaking up, all right? We're just-- Just doing something different for a while. What are you gonna do? J.D. : Me? Hell, l could always find work as a hired gun. There's plenty of that around. But l'm thinking about heading off to Texas. Join the Rangers. So you wanna leave? So you wanna stay? l didn't say that either. Because if you do, there's plenty of stuff you can do around here. There is? Like what? Well, you can get a job. [J.D. LAUGHlNG ] -A job? -Yeah. Me? No. No one cares if you go or stay anyway This day just keeps getting worse. Aw. [JUANlTA WHlMPERlNG ] Hold still, Juanita. Hold that bottle up. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. RO YAL: Mr. James. JAMES: Guy Royal. Hell, last time you set foot on my ranch, you were trying to buy it. lt still ain't for sale. Might be soon, if you can't get your cattle to market. JAMES: Don't count me out. l always get them through. Yeah, but how many homesteads and fences you gotta ride around? And how much meat's left on their bones once you get there? How much good grazing land you got left to fatten them up in the first place? Who the hell is he? RO YAL: This here's Earl. He's a new hire. What he means to say is that town's growing. . . . . .and the number of settlers is growing with it. -Time we put our foot down. -We? Us ranchers start working together instead of against each other. . . . . .well, that might be a damn powerful force. Turn that place into a ghost town. No town, no settlers, no fences. RO YAL: Once that railroad starts coming through. . . . . .we might get control over some valuable land. That town's got those seven men watching over it. Hell, you went up against them once. So did l. Except l ain't in a hurry to do it again. [CHUCKLlNG ] l guess you hadn't heard. NATHAN: Can l help you? l hear you're the doctor in town. No, l just heal folks best l can, but l ain't no doctor. That's exactly what l wish to discuss. l've been doing this a long time, and l've seen a lot of snake oil. . . -. . .sold off the back of wagons-- -Snake oil? You call sewing up gunshot wounds and setting broken bones snake oil? No. l call it practicing medicine without a license. And from this point on, you're out of business. [MlLLlE AND BUCK LAUGHlNG ] l mean, l just had one and my, my. You are a delicate flower, Miss Millie. . . . . .and some old smoky saloon is no place for you. What do you say we find a nice soft haystack. . . -. . .to watch the sunset from? -l know what goes on in haystacks. -Oh, l'd never take advantage of you. -Oh? Well, sometimes my darker side does get the best of me. Will you excuse me for one minute? Nature is screaming out my name right now. Okay? No peeking. [URlNATlNG ] -You're under arrest. -Oh--! [BUCK LAUGHlNG ] You know, if l hadn't just gone, you would have scared it right out of me. Hey! Whoa! What are you doing? Like l said, you're under arrest. For public indecency. You're gonna regret this, marshal. l know l will. BUCK: l'll be right back, Miss Millie. J.D. : You decided to go? JOSlAH: Fate decided. l'm just following. We were just passing through, anyway Town's gonna be a preacher's dream. No drinking, no gambling. Not much to do for an old reformer like me. Besides, if God's everywhere. . . . . .best to start looking sooner more than later. [NATHAN LAUGHlNG ] That means he's gonna find a burning bush to talk to. J.D. : You said you were staying. -Not where l ain't needed. The folks up at that reservation might appreciate my help. You get a fix on that artillery wagon? Found some tracks this morning headed east. Which way are you going? South. Purgatory. Watch your backside. l suggest we leave before the cold shroud of Puritanism smothers us all. BUCK: Unfair imprisonment! l demand a trial! l've been framed! Good old Buck. He always lands on his feet. Well. Gentlemen. VlN: Adios. CHRlS: See you, kid. You coming, kid? J.D. : No. l'm gonna stick around and wait on Buck. Time's up, J.D. You know the law. Hand over your firearms. Well done, son. BlLLY: Hey, J.D. Hey, Billy. Miss Travis. MARY: l've been looking for you. -Did you hear Buck's gotta stay in there. . . . . .for two more days? This marshal has got his head up his-- -Yes, well. -Oh, right. Sorry, Billy. J.D., would you be interested in working for me? J.D. : Uh, a job? What, here, at the paper? -Why me? -Because she asked Ma to ask you. And what did she say, Billy? Well, she might have said a little something, you know-- But l do need the help. My printing press has got a mind of its own. -Will you just think about it? -Uh, think about what? -The job. -Yeah. Yeah, l'll give it some thought. Thanks for the offer, ma'am. MARY: That was supposed to be a secret. Ow! Hey, let me help you. Are you all right? Mm-hm. Billy, hand me a nail, son. Actually, marshal, l'm glad you stopped by. l was wondering if you might consent to an interview for my paper. Perhaps talk about your plans for the town. How charming of you to ask. Well, quite frankly, the town is concerned. People are worried that your methods might not work here. People? Well, let's dispel their worries. Shall we talk over dinner tonight? Um, well, yes, that would be fine. Ma, when's Chris coming back? So, cowboy, what can l do for you? You can start by not calling me cowboy. My name's Chris. What's yours? Amora. No. Your real name. Maria. Well, Maria, what l want you to do, you might not never done before. You'd be surprised. Could be dangerous. Ooh. l like you. Keep talking. Six months ago, l killed a man who used to spend a lot of time. . . . . .over at that there cantina. His name was Cletus Fowler. You ever heard of him? Why are you so interested in a dead man? l wanna know about the man who hired him to kill my wife and son. You'll pay me for this? All right. l ask for you. Se?or Chris? Are you sure there's nothing else l can do for you? RO YAL: Fires happen all the time around this area. lf that town burns down. . . . . .Main Street will turn back into a cattle trail. We get caught with a match in our hand we'll bring the Army down on us. That's why Earl here will see it all through. We don't touch a stick, our names are never mentioned. l don't fancy the blood of women and children on my hands. We'll herd them all out of town before we torch it. Unless they give us grief. A job like this calls for a lot of hired guns. They don't come cheap. You think you can pull this off? You ever hear of a town called Witcoff, Mr. James? No. Exactly. That was my last job. Nice little town. Once. VlN: Howdy. You looking for these? The sergeant needs his wagon back. Now, why don't you make it easy on the both of us and--? Oh, hell, so much for easy. l see your methods are very thorough. Please, go on. Yes, l always like to learn as much as l can about a place before l arrive. For instance, you. l know all about you. And about your husband. l'm sorry. lt must have been very hard losing him at such a young age. . . . . .and in such a violent manner. lt was. On both Billy and me. Billy seems to be coming out of it fine. He's a bright boy. Thank you. l've always felt that motherhood is the most important job a woman can do. lt's unfortunate that some, such as yourself. . . . . .are also forced to do a man's work. l enjoy working, marshal. And it's good to keep your hands busy till you remarry. -Remarry? -l knew several widows back East. . . . . .who did the same by joining the Temperance League. lt's a righteous cause. . . . . .although sometimes their activism went to their heads. Perish the thought. l even overheard one equate the importance of temperance. . . . . .with the issue of women's votes. [BRYCE CHUCKLlNG ] Really? So let me see if l understand here. You don't think women should work, vote or drink? lt's a matter of priorities. Marshal Bryce, here's what l think of your priorities. MAN 1 : Give me a hand here? MAN 2: Yeah. RO YAL: We got 25 men and 1 00 guns. MAN 2: Yeah, l like that. MAN 1 : l got mine. BUCK: J.D. l'm getting out of town and away from him. l'm with you. Let me tell Miss Travis l'm quitting. Give me this hat. Make it fast, boy, because l'm not waiting. Buck. l never thought l'd see you again. Goodness, Miss Millie. How foolish l've been, saving myself. Life is so fleeting. At any moment, someone can be taken away. That's true. Think we should go somewhere and talk about it? -Now, Buck. -Mmm! Wait. Wait. Okay. BUCK: Whoa! Whoa! You just don't do that to a man, hey. Damn it. You're gonna cause me permanent damage here. -Hey, hey. Damn it, hey! -Aw, Buck. See you, Miss Travis. J.D., it's a great job. Just give it some time. Ma'am, l'm a gunslinger, not an ink slinger. Now, can you, uh, tell me which way is Texas? See you, ma'am. [HORSES APPROACHlNG ] Marshal, there's trouble. About 20 gunmen coming into town. One shotgun won't stop them. l don't have any choice. Let me help. Mister, you're in the West now and those men out there. . . . . .are gonna shoot you where you stand. Now, give yourself half a chance and let me back you up. Giving a prisoner a gun is not only against the law. . . . . .it's against my principles. MARY: Don't be a fool, Bryce. [TOWNSFOLK SHOUTlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY] l'll have your guns, gentlemen, if you please. What's he doing out there? Where's he--? What's going on? No, keep looking for the keys. Hurry. They're not here. He must have them. BUCK: That stupid fool! You have 24 hours to comply. Well, how about we just give you the bullets? All right, people. We're gonna burn this town to the ground. So get out of it. Every man, woman and child. You have 24 hours to comply. Help yourselves to whatever you want, fellas. lt all gets torched at sunrise. [GUNFlRE] -What's going on out there? -More of them are coming every hour. They cut the telegraph wires. We have until morning until they burn. . . -. . .the whole town. -Probably working for the cattle ranchers. Only ones with reason to see this place gone. -Where are the keys? BUCK: They took them. Plus all the guns, when they brought the marshal in here. Mary. Leave. You should leave. -l'm not leaving you two here. -Mary, no offense, but you can't help us. Last thing we need is you and Billy getting caught in a crossfire. Billy's with Mrs. Potter. They already left. We gotta find Chris. He went down to Purgatory, right? They should have named it Hell and been over with it. You're not gonna find anybody willing to ride in there. Mary. [WOMAN SCREAMlNG ] Mary, what are you--? [YELLS] Sorry, se?or. l asked about this man. No one knows anything. Or maybe they just won't say. Either way, you've wasted your money. Keep it. You earned it. MARY: Get off me. Get your hands off me. No. [MEN SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] What are you doing here? Help me down, will you? l'm shaking so bad, l can't move. Chris, you gotta come back. All hell's broken loose. [GUNFlRE] [MEN SHOUTlNG ] [GASPlNG ] She was right. l was a fool. Yeah, they're probably gonna pin a medal on you. J.D. : Psst. Hey, Buck. You hold on. J.D. : Buck. Hey. BUCK: l've never been so happy to see anyone. l got halfway out of town and heard gunfire. You gotta find the others. Bring them back. l'm no kid that needs to run for his brothers. l can handle this. Wait here. Don't try to be a hero now. J.D. J.D. J.D. [PANTlNG AND GROANS] BUCK: Marshal? Damn it. Been looking for you. There's bad trouble in town. -How bad? -You and me ain't gonna be enough. -l'll stay with the wagon. -You sure? MARY: l'll be fine. VlN: Let's go. NATHAN: One, two, three. [MAN YELLS] [NATHAN LAUGHlNG ] VlN: Nathan. l don't suppose you came to get your tooth pulled? Town's in trouble. Same town that's got Marshal Bryce? And a lot of other people need our help. -lt's always good to be needed. -Where's Josiah? Uh, somewhere up yonder. CHRlS: There he is. Come on, Lord. l know you're out there. Give me a sign now. Talk to me. [DOG BARKlNG ] Bet you thought that was funny, huh? What kind of a sign is this? CHRlS: Josiah, we need your help. l thought you came up here to talk to God, not a dog. [JOSlAH CHUCKLES] Any idea where Ezra slithered off to? Probably the nearest gambling hall. CHRlS: Let's go get him. Come on, boy. God. Dog. The Lord loves a riddle. [MEN SHOUTlNG ] Ezra, where you headed? Why, to look for you, of course. ls that tar on your face? Look, we really need to leave this municipality. Now. Make some new friends back there, Ezra? l neglected to abide by a fundamental tenet in my line of work: Never gamble with an entire clan. [EZRA SHOUTlNG ] [MEN SHOUTlNG ] MARY: Have you seen my son? WOMAN: Yes, he's in the back. MARY: Thank you. Three of you stay here, get those guns unloaded. Vin, let's go. NATHAN: They full of guns? EZRA: Courtesy of the U.S. Army. lf you're here when the sun rises, you'll burn down with the town. Now get a move on! Move it! Now! [GUNFlRE] [PEOPLE SHOUTlNG ] J.D. [lN NASAL VOlCE] : Hey, give me a hand with the barrel, will you? Come on, give me a hand. lt's heavy. Give me a hand, will you? [MAN 1 GRUNTS] J.D. [lN NORMAL VOlCE] : Thank you. MAN 2: What's going on here? J.D. : You boys got a choice. You put down them guns, or l can put you both in a pine box. [MEN GRUNT] Thank you. VlN: We're outgunned at least 5-to-1 . -Buck's still in jail. We gotta get him out. Let's go get him. J.D. : Buck, your hero has returned. BUCK: About time you got here. What did l tell you? You almost got your fool head blown off. He's gone, Vin. NATHAN: All the boxes are the same. No guns. Just a bunch of uniforms and this old cannon. Any cannon balls? This is it. Just the one. J.D. : What are we gonna do now, Chris? J.D. : What are we supposed to do with a bunch of uniforms? NATHAN: Use them for bandages. There's that sense of humor again, huh? What? -Put it on. J.D: Put them on? CHRlS: Get these townsfolk into them too. VlN: Come on, folks, let's go. Everybody get down here. Never thought l'd wear the Union blue. . . . . .but l always did fancy being a colonel. J.D. : All right, put this on. VlN: You're in the Army now. J.D. : Doesn't matter if it's too big. Put it on. Come on, folks. Let's go. Hey. You're promoted. CHRlS: All right, everybody, let's get to it. MAN: The Army's coming. [MAN SHOUTlNG lN SPANlSH] MAN: The Army's coming. The Army's coming. The Army's coming. The Army's coming? All right, let's burn the town down. Let's go, get off your carcass. Burn it down now. Let's go. Light it up. l wanna see this town burning. Let's see some smoke. Hyah! Let's go. Get a torch on this hardware store. Let's go! Think they gonna buy this Army thing? -l doubt it. CHRlS: Let's ride. [MEN SHOUTlNG ] MAN: All right, clear it out. EARL: Don't leave anything standing. Steal it or burn it. MAN 1 : Army coming in. EARL: Get back here, you yellow dogs. MAN 2: l didn't sign on to fight no Army. MAN 3: Me neither. EARL: Get back here and fight. The yellow dogs went off and left us. Come on, we can win this fight. -Let's gun them. MAN 4: All right, let's gun them. MAN 5: Come on, let's get out of here. CHRlS: Hold! You signed on to finish this fight. MAN 6: l ain't fighting no Army. EARL: Wait a minute. Hold on. They ain't Army. Get them! [ALL GRUNTlNG ] EARL: Take cover in the bank. JOSlAH: Give a hand. NATHAN: You ever worked one of these? VlN: Just swing it around. BUCK: Put your back into it, J.D. Don't let it spread. J.D. : Got you, Buck. BUCK: We got fire over here. CASEY: Hurry, Millie. VlN: Fire in the hole! CHRlS: Did we get them? VlN: lt looks that way. [GUN COCKS] [EARL GRUNTS] CABlNET MAKER: Boy, am l glad you guys were here. Yes, sir. -Here, have a cigar. -Thanks. MlLLlE: Buck. Daddy decided since we're all packed up, we're moving back to Kansas. [NATHAN GRUNTS] l'm gonna miss you so much. All they'd say is that Earl hired them. Might be all they know. l got a hunch who's behind Earl. Hunches don't get convictions in the court of law. Doesn't sit well with me either. Too bad about Marshal Bryce. They taking him home? Can't say much for his ways, but the man did have some grit. J.D. : So, judge, when are they gonna send up another marshal? They're not. May we assume you had something to do with that, judge? Damn right. Wired those railroad bureaucrats and told them how it's done in the West. l also told them l hired a set of lawmen to look after their interests. l ain't working for no railroad. l'm not wearing no badge neither. You don't have to. lt's unofficial. The town needs you. Just a little while longer. Perhaps if some sort of a bonus were offered. A dollar a day, plus board and room. Just the same as before. Well, boys, what say we head over to the saloon. . . -. . .and ponder the judge's proposal. EZRA: Wonderful idea. J.D. : Reckon l can do some pondering.
