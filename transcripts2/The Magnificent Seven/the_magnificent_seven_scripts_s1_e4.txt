 l tell you, some mornings, it just don't pay to get up and get out of bed. Other side of it is, you ain't losing another pair of boots.

 Nathan, why don't you see if the lady has any more luggage. -l have one more, but l ...  -Why won't you do it yourself? Don't mind him. Him's just a bit ornery in the morning... ...if you know what l mean. No. Put your guns away. Now, that was not very polite, Olivia. What do you say to these gentlemen? You need to learn how to duck, mister. -Where are we? -Where were going. How can we be where we're going if were not there yet? Because we're almost there. And then well be there. So we're as good as there. But not there. No. -ls that mustache real or fake? -Pull it. Don't pull it that hard. -When are we gonna be there? -When we get there. Dismount! lf you don't mind me saying so, Miss Greer ...  Oh, it's Mrs. Greer. -There a Mr. Greer? -My husband died of the fever. That would be a mountain for anybody to climb. But Yuma Prison, that don't seem to fit the woman l see before me. A youthful indiscretion, for which l paid a price. -Life is full of problems. -Well, problems... ...are only opportunities with thorns, Mr. Wilmington. That is pure poetry, ma'am. Please, call me Buck. Can we see Mrs. Travis now... ...Buck? Wait, l'll get that for you, Mrs. Greer. Ma'am, why don't you come on with me. Okay. Come on. -l seen the way you look at my mama. -l was just being friendly. You gonna be my daddy? That's not my plan, no. -How do l know? -Because l just told you so. lf you ain't gonna marry her... ...you better stop looking at her the way you do. Put me down. Fine. Excuse me. Six years old, she's already figuring to make some man miserable. -You the authority on that. -l tell you, women... ...they got your number from the day they're born. Well, Terry, you're all set. l've arranged a room for you at the hotel... ...and a job interview tomorrow at the general store in Bitter Creek. l thought that there was something here. l wanna get Olivia in school... ...and living a normal life as soon as possible. We're still building this town. We want it to be a safe place to raise a child... ...but we're not quite there yet. l don't want you to think that l'm not grateful for your support. After my husband passed away... ...my trouble came out of a need to support Olivia. l was sentenced to three years for robbery. l understand the pain you've endured. l lost my husband too. And my son is living with his grandparents. Ladies. -How can l help you, sir? -My name's Morgan Hill. l'm planning to open an emporium where the saddle shop was. l was hoping to make the announcement soon... ...by placing a notice in your newspaper. Well, we offer a discount for new business, Mr. Hill. l have a rate sheet right here. -There you go. -Well, thank you, ma'am. l'll get this back to you later. Afternoon. Olivia, l have to buy some necessities. -lf she could stay here? -Oh, of course. Hey there. -Nathan, let's go. -l'm hungry. -Come on. Come on, let's go. -Gentlemen... ...perhaps you could take Olivia for a meal at the hotel. Well, we gotta be over at the.... What time we gotta be at the ... ? All this little girl has known is the inside of prison walls. lt won't hurt us to help her get something to eat. -All right. -Come on, Olivia. Thank you. Have you seen my watch anywhere? -Your watch? -Yeah. -Are you sure? -Yeah. lt's silver. -l know what it looks like. -And a chain. Maybe you left it back at the saloon. Don't worry about it. That watch was a family heirloom from my grandfather. Meant everything to me. Well, you'll get it back. Just like you got your boots. Well, l knew where they were, you know. -Hey, what you got in your box? -lt's a secret. You can tell us. We won't tell nobody. Then it wouldn't be a secret. You see? You see how young they start with the secrets? Did l ever tell you about the time l lost my boots? Can you keep a secret? Olivia! -l thought you had her. Olivia! -Olivia! Olivia! -Olivia! -Missy, next time you decide... ...to take a side journey, it'd be nice if you let us know. You said it would be a fast pickup. This is the package we ended up with. -Prisoner's a female. -l didn't know. So, what are we, boys? Damn babysitters now? -The language around a child. -That is not a child. That is a hellion. He's just a little emotional. -He lost his pocket watch. -My father's watch. An heirloom. lt was my grandpa's watch. l saw you win that watch in a poker game last week. -Well, it still had sentimental value. -Yeah. You gonna deal those cards, or you gonna get a real job? l don't need to work, my friend. l get paid every time you boys sit down to a game. You should have told me it was a woman they were picking up. Didn't think it mattered. What a man don't know can get him killed. Well, Mr. Larabee, you should read my paper. There's new money in town. We're making progress. -Too much progress. -Excuse me? l'm beginning to feel out of place. Hello, Terry. You know, l've been doing things the hard way since you've been gone. Lost some men using guns and dynamite. Hell, my powder man went all to pieces on me. Look... ...my daughter and l.... We've been given a second chance. Now, how do you suppose you got on that newspaper lady's parole list? l still know how to grease the right palms when need be. -Morgan, please ...  -l've been keeping my eye... ...on this bank over here, waiting for you to get out. The Federal Loan money's only there for a few days, so we gotta go now. No. No, l won't jeopardize our future. Honey, you don't cooperate, you don't have a future. Neither does that darling little girl of yours. Come on. -Good morning. -Good morning. -May l be of service, sir? -l believe you can. l'm considering the deposit of a significant sum to your institution. However, l have the natural businessman's concerns... ...in these days of lawlessness. Then security would be foremost in your mind. -Precisely. -Our vault, sir... ...is imported from Paris. Two and a half centimeters steel bars. Nothing safer this side of Chicago. King high. -Ace high. -Well, my, my. Fortune is indeed smiling upon you today. Nope. He's palming cards. l know. -You saying l cheated? -Not at all. l'm saying you cheated badly. The queen l dealt you was tucked neatly in your right boot. l detest an amateur. Well, l'll be... -...taking my leave now. -That, l think, would be best. Tell me... -...how'd you know? -Lessons will cost you extra. Good day. What are you doing? Look, you damn near got us killed, girl. Come on. Come on. Mama don't approve of that language. Hey, Nathan. Take this. Mrs. Greer. l don't mind helping out with your girl, but l got some important things to do. -l had business. -What's going on? -Who the hell's this? -Who are you? Look, he's a friend. -Let him walk. l'll do what you want. -Hey, easy there, pard. Not out here. Front of the bank's no place for a dustup. Bring him along, we'll ask him questions later. Get moving. -You dumping me like they did? -Absolutely not. Just thought you'd be happier with your mama. Besides, the saloon is no place for a pretty lady to wait. Come here. -Get down. -l wanna see. l said, get down. Where's your little girl? -Being taken care of, out of town. -Don't play me for a fool. -l saw her at the newspaper office. -Well, she's gone now. Put her on a horse. Those two appear to be more than friendly. l'd say these guys wanna turn me on a spit. l'm sorry. Though you do go on at the mouth a bit... ...but you don't seem like a bad person. -What do they have in mind? -Robbing that bank. -Where do you come in? -l'm the cracksman. -Excuse me? -Safecracker. Tell them we worked together before. -All right. Who the hell are you? -Buck Wilmington. -From where? -Any place you can get to. Sometimes even further. -ln what capacity? -Well, that depends... ...on how rich the money is. Buck's one of the best powder men l've ever worked with. And when'd you work with him? Before you. l thought before me was your husband. You know, l don't need a powder man. You want me? He's with me. Prison gave you new dimensions, Terry. Made you bold. l like that. Just remember, l'm not one to be crossed. lt won't hurt to keep him around here... ...at least until we get the real insurance. Keep her in line. That little girl is somewhere in town. Go find her. Let's go. Gotta get my mama back. -We plan on it, little lady. -J.D., take her to the church. Tell Josiah l said to look after her till we get this thing settled. You got it. Come on, we gotta get you under wraps. Why didn't you fight those men? l'd be no match for five guns. Not to say l'm not fast. This side of Chris Larabee, l am the fastest hereabouts. lt's just safety in numbers. Hey, you seen my cuff links? What's a cuff link? All right. They're crossing the border. The odds are right. Let's take them. Odds just changed. Come on. Shoot. l guess we'll have to wait till they get settled in down there. So how's your Spanish? Yours? What's ''no bueno'' mean? -You over there. -Olivia... ...how is it you knew the gentleman in the saloon was cheating? Learned to spot a double-dealer in prison. Now, there must be a way to put a God-given talent like that to use. Why you always wrap an angle on somebody else's pain? Pain? My friend, this child has the gift. Was my mama taken by those men because she's been in prison? -That could be, honey. -Go to prison... ...you cross paths with people don't have your best interests at heart. Now she won't get a second chance? lf we got anything to do with it, she will. So, what's your pleasure, Olivia? How about Go Fish? -Five-card stud. Deuces are wild. -What a delightful child. Bet you she wins. Purgatorio. When l was a bounty hunter, l chased a few desperadoes here. Place is so overrun with outlaws... ...nobody wearing a star will come within a bullet's distance. -A real hellhole. -Sounds like fun. Well, we're going to hell any way you look at it. Come on. Last time l was here, l had a run-in with a gunslinger named Bob Harper. The Bob Harper? What happened? Let's just say it was a bad time for his gun to stick. At least they keep the streets clean. Ugly cuss who was shot.... -Yeah? -l took him in once. Ugly cuss who shot him... ...took him in too. His whole gang knows me. Stick around here, you'll be deader than a beaver hat. -l'll take that chance. -l won't. You get on back to town. lf we're not there by morning, you come hunting. Darling, just look at you. Remember how you used to dress? The feel of silk against your skin? After this bank, l sink into South America for good. -We could make a life there. -No. -My life is with Olivia. -You've changed since l found you. You didn't find me. You arrested me. Kansas City is a long time back. My father died in prison... ...and my husband is dead because of you. They were both fools. l can provide for you, Terry. l can give you that future. You can do whatever you want, but it won't be with me. l'm through. Take him outside and shoot him. Buck Wilmington! You shot my brother in the back. Now, l'm here to kill you. Did you like that? You're gonna love this. You are as ugly and gutless as your brother. Go ahead. Just shoot straight. l'll see you in hell. All of you, you go to hell. Here. Takes care of that problem. -Tequila. Right now. -Here you go. That was some show. You mind? l don't mind. You're paying for it. Hard to lose kin. Happened to me in the war. Seems there's no justice. l make my own justice. You in the habit of just shooting people? l'm in the habit of doing anything l want. Well, l admire that in a man. Would l know you? Would l know you? Name's Morgan Coltrane. l was a sheriff over in Missouri. l could maybe use a man like you in my business. Yeah? What kind of business is that? The business of making money. You interested? -Yeah, l'm interested. -l thought you might be. Let's talk. Hope she likes dolls. -lt's pretty. -l think she'll like it. Your dexterity with the cards is amazing, my dear. Kid's a natural. Finally met your match, eh, Ezra? Well, what've you got? Aces, back-to-back. Let me deal. -Knocking next time might be better. -Sorry. Look what we got for you. Hey.... Thanks. -ls everything okay, honey? -Not till my mom gets back. Well, that's an understandable feeling. Maybe a meal will make you feel better, huh? A bank, huh? -Two guards? -Two guards. But rumor has it, there's some hired guns... ...that help out the locals if need be. All right. l'm in. All right. Name is Chris. -Let's get them. -Slow down a second, cowboy. Within the hour. Let's go rob a bank, huh? Now, Chris, this here's Terry Greer. And like her father before her, Terry is a virtuoso with a safe. Now, this fellow you shot over here was a friend of Mrs. Greer's. Closer, l expect, than she'll admit. l'd like you to ride herd on her. Oh, l can do that, Morgan. You enjoy yourself, darling. Whatever he did to your brother, you didn't have to kill him. He's in a better place now. Trust me. Damn jacket. Nice botas. Hat too, huh? Man's hat. Give me the gun. Give it, give it. My boots. Bet you liked these, didn't you, huh? Liked my boots. Give it. Give it. Did they really have cows in the middle of the street? The Hindus considered them sacred. Sometimes they'd walk right into your house. l wish my father was a mi ...  -A miss ... A miss ...  -Missionary? Yeah. -Where is your father, Olivia? -l never knew my father. But your father knows you. -How? -Because he lives right here. -Where's lndia? -Oh, about a million miles from here. And in that place, there lived a most beautiful woman. Like my mama? Well, maybe not quite that beautiful. Anyway... ...this woman was so beautiful... ...that she was chosen by five different gods to bear them their sons. One day, they would grow up to be great warriors... ...who would cleanse the Earth... ...of all that was evil. Do you think my dad could have been a god? You see her? Howdy, boys. Where's Olivia? Olivia! Olivia! Olivia! Check over there. Hi there, Olivia. -l don't know you. -Well, l know you. Hey! Olivia! Put her down! Hey! Hey! Hey! -They got her. They got Olivia. -Come on, come on. l got your gun, kid. All right, easy now. Yeah, he gonna be all right. As long as he takes it easy for a few days. Nathan, you keep an eye on J.D. The rest of us will keep searching for the girl. What happened? -Long story. -Where's Chris? With the gang. On his way to rob the bank. -What? -lt's a long story. Well, come on. We gotta find Olivia. -l wanna go. -Hold still, man. Buck. lt's Coltrane. Where's your kid? -She's somewhere safe. -Sure about that? Morgan, please. -You don't have to ...  -Terry... ...don't make me kill you. Not in front of your daughter. You don't do your job, l will. Now, let's go. Keep quiet. Better go get Nathan. -Good evening, ma'am. -Lovely evening. -Hate to spoil it by shooting you. -l'll take that. -Go easy, there. -Get to work, darling. Come on. Well, you haven't lost your touch. Let's go, come on. Mary Travis is a friend of mine. Buck Wilmington is not dead. His death was staged. l don't have time to explain. Even if l believe you, they have Olivia ...  -Are you talking or working in there? -Relax. -What do l do? -Play it out. Let's go, people. -What the hell...? -What...? Fire! l wouldn't. Toss it. You all right, huh? l said, l wouldn't. Kidnap a child, l ought to shoot you now. Go ahead, reach for it. l said, reach for it. -You all right? -Yeah. l believe this is my watch, young lady. Got it. Let's go, boys and girls. Come on. -There's your mama. -Guys, bring them horses in. Mount up. Keep an eye on the girl. Olivia's safe. Let's go! -Careful! Be careful, get down! -Where you going? -Get down! -Olivia. Mama! -Mama! Mama! -Olivia! Bitter Creek's not that far off. l'll check your progress from time to time. Well, we'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for your kindness. -Say goodbye, sweetie. -Bye. Hold on, there. Hold on, there, little angel. Now, pickpocketing, that's a habit you're gonna have to give up. Deal? The money means a lot. lt's kept hope alive for the farmers. -Progress. -Progress. Go on. Well, good thing l play dead so well. But to tell you the truth, Chris... ...l think l could have handled that situation myself. l should've shot you while l had the chance. -Hey, Buck. -Yeah? -What time you got? -lt's.... Hey!
