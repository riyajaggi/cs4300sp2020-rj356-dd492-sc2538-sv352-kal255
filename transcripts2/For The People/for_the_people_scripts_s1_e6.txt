 The bear claw this week goes to Allison,
 who got a full dismissal
in the Locarno matter.
 You love that watch.
 It bothers me it isn't real.
 Am I really supposed to believe
 that what's on the inside doesn't count?
 We have to do this together.
 I don't want to do it any other way.
 I'm the guy who makes it worse.
 I'm the guy you don't
want to go up against.
 I didn't stumble into this case.
 I saw it, I wanted it, and I took it.
 I don't want fun.
I want challenging, interesting.

- Would what work?
 Us. Would we work?
 I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

 REPORTER: The island nation of Córdoba
is still reeling this morning
 after damage caused by
Category 5 Hurricane Jasper.
 They also now face a graver
threat... armed acts of piracy.
 According to U.S. officials,
 island resident Arturo Marquez
 was armed with automatic weapons
 when he boarded a relief ship
 and forcibly removed thousands
of pounds of supplies.
 Marquez is now in custody
with the United States Marines.
 Marquez...
Is he in the Southern District?
 I can't comment on that.
 I want it.
 I can comment on that. No.
 I do have something for you, though.
 Just came in.
 Assault? Roger...
 Not just any assault.
 This guy and others like him
 are creating a real problem in this city,
 and it's time to
put the federal foot down.
 And it's not just any opposing counsel.
 It's someone you will
enjoy going up against.
 So, take a closer look
 before you start flicking
your applesauce in my face.
 [CHUCKLES]
 Oh.
 Right.
 Your Honor, Mr. Morris is being charged
 with a single count under 18 USC 113...
 assault on federal land.
 As alleged in the complaint,
Mr. Morris dove...
 uh, "flew", his words...
 and tackled an unarmed tourist
 at the African Burial Ground
National Monument.
 I'm sorry... I keep referring to
him as Mr. Morris.
 Would the defendant prefer
"Captain Shadow," Ms. Bell?
 Captain Shadow.
 Captain Shadow.
 Very well, Captain.
 Your Honor, Mr. Shadow...
 my client had a good-faith belief
 that he was stopping a kidnapping.
 The victim was chasing after his toddler.
 Yeah, I... I don't... I didn't...
 JUDGE ENGEL: Do you understand
the charges, Mr. Morris?
 Yes, Your Honor.
 And how do you plead?
 Not guilty, Your Honor.
 I'll release Mr. Morris on a $5,000 bond.
 Normal restrictions,
 but I'll add an additional requirement
 of an 8:00 p.m. curfew.
 Crime spikes in the city around 10:00.
 I really need to be out there.
 The curfew is fine, Your Honor.
 We'll also need the costume...
as evidence.
 "Costume"?
 JUDGE ENGEL: Defendant will
surrender the costume.
 We're in recess.
 Does this look like a costume to you?
 It's not Halloween.
 I do not like that guy.
 Director Fury.
 Mm. Is that the joke
they programmed into you?
 I thought I'd enjoy this more.
 Come by my office. Let's work out a deal.
 You can come to me.
 I could, but I'm not going to.
 Like your client, the Eagle does not fly.
 You live with Sandra, right?
 She's a little tidier at home.
 She actually lives out of a bag.
 A go-bag. I had one of those
when I was married.
 Used it.
 You saw the news this morning?
 I don't have Internet.
 There are papers.
 The big, floppy things with the...
 No.
 Arturo Marquez.
 The United States Marines
took him into custody in Córdoba
 and brought him to New York.
 There was some question about
 whether he was gonna be held
as an enemy combatant,
 but the U.S. Attorney
just unsealed an indictment.
 He's being charged with piracy.
 That's a real thing? Piracy?
 It's a thing for which
the sentence is life in prison.
 Very real.
 Are you giving it to me?
 - Do you want it?
- Of course.
 You've handled your cases
incredibly well, Allison.
 All of them. But this is different.
 This is of a different magnitude.
 I understand.
 I'm not sure you do.
 But you will.

 Where am I?
 This is the Metropolitan
Corrections Center.
 Where?
 New York.
 You're in New York City.
 New York?
 Why am I in New York?
 The United States government
has charged you with piracy.
 For removing the supplies from the ship?
 Yes.
 That ship was sitting
outside of port for days.
 Why was it sitting there?
 The hurricane had passed.
 There were people dying everywhere.
 I had to do something.
 We went out to the ship once.
They wouldn't talk to us.
 So we went back with guns.
 We took everything we could.
 My daughter...

 A pirate? I don't like pirates.
 There's nothing not to like
about Arturo Marquez.
 There's nothing to like
about Leonard Knox.
 You would do better with this.
 You would do better with this.

- No.
 [SIGHS] I have to face Leonard.
 I want to face Leonard.
 I can defend Arturo Marquez.
 You can do anything. You are undefeated.
 I got beat in my first case by Leonard.
 Jay got absolutely destroyed in his.
 - Maybe it's too harsh.
- Maybe.
 The point is, Allison,
it's your turn to lose.
 Not my point.
 Why is this case even here anyway?
 In the Southern District of New York?
 Marquez isn't from here.
The ship isn't from here.
 The hurricane didn't hit here.
 If there's a case,
it should be in Córdoba.
 - You'll be fine.
- Still undefeated.
 Before we set a trial date, Ms. Chavez,
 when does the government
plan to produce discovery?
 Your Honor, I think that's premature
 since we intend to move to
 dismiss the indictment altogether.
 On what basis would I dismiss it?
 Jurisdiction, Your Honor.
 There wasn't a single
U.S. citizen on board that ship,
 it wasn't flying a U.S. flag,
 and the charitable organization
that sponsored it,
 Pan American Relief, is based in Toronto.
 There was no kidnapping
under 18 USC 1201,
 no hostage-taking under 18 USC 1203.
 U.S. law enforcement
has no interest here at all.
 The whole world has
an interest here, Your Honor,
 in ensuring the safety
and security of the high seas.
 Córdoba is a sovereign nation
with its own judiciary.
 The judicial infrastructure of
Córdoba has been decimated.
 The United States is in
a unique position to respond.
 If pirates are allowed to attack
relief ships without reprisal,
 it will set a precedent
 that will affect all nations
going forward
 wherever humanitarian aid may be needed.
 It's as simple as that.
 Nothing about this case
is simple, Ms. Chavez.
 But I do find the government's argument
 on jurisdiction compelling.
 Please move forward on discovery.
 Let's set a trial date.
 Can I get you anything?
 You can get me out of here.
 It doesn't have to be this way
between you and me.
 We both clerked on the Supreme Court.
 We're both attractive.
 We're both next level.
 In addition to everything gross
you just said,
 you're the guy who
introduced himself to me
 as "the guy you don't want
to go up against."
 So this is how this is. Now say a number.
 - Six months.
- Probation.
 - That's not a number.
- Plus a $1,000 fine.
 Three months, no fine.
 The guy Freddie allegedly assaulted
 doesn't have a scratch on him.
 He has a broken collarbone.
 I could've charged this
as aggravated assault.
 I'm coming way down.
 One month.
 Three months.
 I'll take it to my client.
 Don't just take it. Sell it.
 Because it won't get any better
than this for Freddie,
 and you... you don't want to go
up against me in court again.
 Yeah, I guess this does just feel right.
 This way.
 Ugh.

 What? No. I'm in the field.
 What field?
 The field. Out.
 You know, the field.

 Listen, somebody just approached
my confidential informant
 and asked him to
murder someone for $5,000.
 Now, I can go in there
and make an arrest,

 You should contact Seth Oliver.
 Who is Seth Oliver?
 Um, never mind. What did your CI say?
 He said he'd think about it.
 And were there any witnesses?
 No. He didn't actually meet with
the person making the request.
 It all came through an intermediary.
 And obviously no money changed hands?
 - No.
- Then you don't have enough.
 You need your CI to go back in
 and get the request directly on tape.
 I can't blow my CI's cover.
 Our office can't prosecute
without that tape.
 I'll send someone else in.
 I'll tell my CI to say
that he can't do it
 but he knows someone who can.
 I'll send in an undercover agent

 No. I'm not sending a rookie AUSA

 People get hurt in these operations.
 Maybe we could send Seth.
 They contacted me.
If I don't participate,
 there's a good chance
the operation isn't successful.
 But if I do participate

take the supplies

 I have never hurt anyone in my life,

 Did you keep any of the money

 Yes, I did.
 A few hundred Eastern Caribbean dollars.
 I used that money to bury my son.

 [WATER TURNS OFF]
 [WIPING HANDS]
 A few years ago,
 I deposed an Army bomb-disposal expert,
 four tours of Iraq
and Afghanistan under his belt.
 He told me that
the top-tier guys in his field
 are so sure of themselves,
 when they walk toward explosives,
 their heart rate actually goes down.
 Well, that's not
happening to me right now.
 But I'm not disposing of a bomb.
 I'm throwing one.
 When the storm came,
 Arturo Marquez
was on the floor of his home
 on the small nutmeg farm he worked
 and that his father had worked,
 and that his father's father had worked.
 He was told to stay inside.
 It didn't matter.
 Inside soon became outside.
 The world was turned upside-down.
 His home was destroyed.
 His farm, his family, his life.
 In the face of a calamity
 none of us could probably ever imagine,
 Arturo didn't fold.
 He didn't run. He didn't riot.
 He got up off of that floor,
and he went to work.
 He tried to help
in the only way he knew how.
 Was he right to take
those supplies from that ship?
 Was he right to sell them?
 We could debate those choices,
 but Arturo didn't have
the luxury of time.
 He had to act.
 And now it's your turn to act.
 To make a difficult choice.
 I don't know any of you.
 And you obviously don't know me.
 I'm sure we come from different places,
 many of us, different means,
different experiences,
 but we're here now,
 and we are all privileged to be here.
 I do know that.
 Not just here in New York,
 in the fortunate lives
that most of us lead.
 Right here, right now, in this courtroom.
 Because you have the privilege...
 and it is a privilege...
 to show Arturo Marquez
 why the American criminal justice system
 is the greatest in the world.
 He wonders about this, rightly.
 He's here because
he was taken at gunpoint,
 chained in the hull of a ship,
 and forced to travel 2,111 miles
to a country he's never been to,
 charged with a crime most of us
have never even heard of.
 This is what he knows about America.
 But you know more than that.
 You know America is good
and decent and compassionate,
 that we are brave,
 and in times of trial,
we do the right thing.
 I am asking you to do the right thing.
 Show Arturo the best of America.
 Send him home.
 A plea of guilty has been entered
 in the matter of United States
versus Freddie Morris.
 Mr. Morris, you have one week
to get your affairs in order.
 Then you will begin
your sentence of 30 days.
 - You're impressed.
- I was impressed.
 I was standing there in court
 thinking how I was wrong about you,
 that you actually had a soul,
 could look another human
in the eye and relate to them.
 And it scared me because I was like,
 "Wow. This guy could be
 the second-best lawyer in this building,
 and I'm gonna have to
go up against him for decades."
 Why are you speaking in the past tense?
 Because you're exactly
who I thought you were.
 You never jumped off a building
pretending to be Superman.
 Can't stand Superman. I'm a Marvel guy.
 You never broke your ankles.
 Would I look this good if I had?
 You're disgusting.
 Maybe, but I'm also
undefeated against you.
 Don't be so self-righteous.
 I did what had to be done so we
both could get what we wanted.
 You should be thanking me.
 [LAUGHS] I will never.
 - Until next time.
- Can't wait.
 Well, we did it.
 You did it.
 Okay, we did it.
 We did it.
 It was a pleasure.
 All mine.
