 ♪♪ First day of college registration is crucial. You see, getting into the right classes could determine your major, your future, and more importantly, how late you could sleep in the morning. So why am I wasting my time preparing breakfast for two? That's why-- Leslie Burke. Lucky me. The girl next door is next door. - Zack, I'm late for registration. - I know, I know. But you've got to start your day off with something nice and warm.

 - Breakfast? - That, too. That's so sweet! You made Pop-Tarts for both of us? Well-- Alex, look what Zack made for us. Oh, Zack. You didn't have to go to all that trouble. Ooh, by the way, I like my coffee with cream and sugar. Well, ah-- how about dinner tonight? I can't. I am really busy. [chuckles] I-- I meant you. - Sure, sounds fun. - Good. Pop-Tarts. You know, rumor has it that's how Lyle Lovett snagged Julia Roberts.

You got a package here. - [grunts] - Another care package? Grandma Powers already sent me everything I need. I wonder what's in this one? Feels like Grandma Powers. Does it smell like mothballs and Polident? I'll do a lot of things for you, kid, but I won't smell your mail. Oh. Get it over here, will you? [grunts] Excuse me, but, uh, do you know-- uh, um. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, I'm looking for Zack Morris. Not another one. Look, I've already cancelled the wet T-shirt contest. Oh, [chuckles], no, no. I'm Kelly Kapowski. I went to high school with the guys. Oh, I understand. Zack owes you money. 218. Oh, wha-- um, I have been lost for about three hours. Can you maybe point me in the right direction? [grunts] Ah! I think I can find it from here. - Good. - Thanks. [exhales sharply] Guess who's here? Sorry, the wet T-shirt contest was cancelled. Screech, it's me, Kelly! Kelly? - What are you doing here? - Hey! I'm going to school here at Cal U. I was on the waiting list. And they just called me. I can't believe it. It's so great to see you. Hey, you can move right into our suite. One of the girls just transferred. Oh, hey, Screech, that's great! Listen, let's not tell Zack, OK? I want to surprise him. - Deal. - OK. You're going to love it here, Kelly. You can stay up all night. No one tells you when to brush your teeth or go to bed. - [laughs] - Except, of course, Zack and Slater. This is a total disaster. All the acting classes are full. I couldn't even get into mime class. - Why not? - How should I know? You can't get a word out of those people. Yes! I'm out of here. Tell me, how'd you get through the line so fast? I'm a jock. It turns out the athletic department pre-registered me. Aw, m-- And all snap courses, too. Check it out. Theory of Solid State Electronics. Doesn't sound easy to me. Our first class is learning to program a VCR. And what's your midterm? Taping one show while watching another? Gee, I hope not. Hey, Mr. Rogers. What are you doing down here? Hey, Screech. Ah, I still need some undergraduate courses to get my master's. So I'm taking Sociology 101. [laughs] You're taking freshman classes at your age? - That's really-- - Really what? Really inspiring! Zack, I got all the courses I wanted. - Oh. - What did you get? I got Anthropology, English, and a brand-new pair of 501's that you are going to love tonight. [chuckles] I can't wait to see them. Good. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oops, sorry. (SINGING) ♪ Some guys have all the luck ♪ I had a really great time, Zack. Good. It was so sweet that you cried when they freed Willy. Oh, no, no, no. I-- I wasn't crying. I-- I had a Good & Plenty in my eye. OK. Fine. Let me walk you to your door. Well, here we are. You know, I really like you, Zack. Which is why I think we shouldn't go out anymore. What? Look, [sighs] to you, women are like baseball cards. Whoa, I got a Leslie Burke. And I want to trade it for a Susie Johnson and a redhead to be named later. Wait, wait. Maybe you're right. But it's only because-- I'm afraid to get too close to a woman again. Again? No, no, I, I don't want to talk about her. - Who? - Kelly. Kelly Kapowski. We went out in high school. What happened? She-- left me. [chuckles] I'm sorry, Zack. But everyone's been dumped before. No, no. You didn't let me finish. You see, when she left me, we were on a boat, a sailboat. It was very romantic. But then the weather started getting rough. And tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew, the-- (STAMMERS) the Coast Guard crew, I-- I would have been lost at sea, too. - It was-- - Oh, that's horrible. - She drowned? - Don't-- "drowned." No, no, no, no. I-- I prefer to think-- she's swimming with the mermaids. Oh, Zack. I feel so badly for you. I have kept her picture with me. Well, not the exact picture. That one got all wet and wrinkly. Actually, these are reprints that I had made. Oh, she's so pretty. Yes. Yes, she was. She really was. Hey, Zack! Guess who? Kelly! You made it! I don't believe it! It's a miracle! Oh! [laughs] Not really. I was on the waiting list. Oh, she's alert. She's alive. She's dry. Zack, that ship has sailed and sunk. And so have you. Oh, did I interrupt something? Was that your girlfriend? Because your old girlfriend living with your new girlfriend, that could be a little awkward. [chuckles] Yeah, it could. Wait a minute. You're living-- - Right here. - Right he-- I'm going to be in your suite. I'll be Leslie's roommate. You are? Well, (STAMMERS) there's 30,000 other students here. How could that have happened? Don't thank me, Zack. It took some doing, but it was my pleasure. You owe me big, (DRAWLS) buddy! - Group hug! - Uh! Zack, you're hugging a bit hard. [honks horn] Gosh, Screech. Would you please park your nerd-cycle outside? But someone might steal it. And then what would happen? Then someone else would look like an idiot. [honks horn] [rings bike bell] I'm-- I'm sorry. So I told a little fib. A little? You killed the girl. Yeah, but I killed her for you. Look, Leslie, there's absolutely nothing between Kelly and me anymore. Well, it doesn't matter because I have no interest in you whatsoever. Ooh-hoo, you are toast. Not yet, I'm not. I was thinking, I could sneak a look at her schedule. Well, what good will that do? Well, if I'm in Leslie's classes, I'll sit next to her. We'll be in study groups together. We'll pull all-nighters. - Aah. - Ha? Education is a wonderful thing, Slater. Tell me about it. In Folk Art 101, I'm learning to crochet an afghan for my mom. [chuckles] So, uh, you know, um, we haven't had much chance to talk. So, uh, let's see, um, what are you majoring in, huh? Nothing. What does it matter? I didn't get a single class I wanted. Look at this-- English, Language, History. Do you call that an education? Because I don't! And if I don't get a class in my major soon, life as I know it will be over and I will just shrivel up and die. [sobs] Let me guess. Drama major? How'd you know? Uh, it's just a hunch. So are you going to be here the whole year? Uh, I don't want to be critical, but if I have people over, would you mind hiding the dinosaur in the closet? Oh, I guess they are a little silly. It's just, you know, being away from home, they kind of make me feel better. I mean, this place is so big and the people are just so-- different. You noticed that, too. So, Kelly, uh, tell us all about yourself. [chuckles] Well, let's see. Um, I'm from L.A. And I come from a big family. Yeah, yeah, I get it. So how close were you and Zack? Oh, well, we were pretty serious for a while. I mean, he was the first guy I ever kissed. Well, I mean, really kissed. Fine, that's enough. Boy, she goes on and on. Well, I'm just going to go look for the laundry room. So, Leslie, are we a little jealous? Of Kel-- get out of here! (SINGING) ♪ Leslie likes Zack ♪ ♪ Leslie likes Zack ♪ I'm not! He-- he's a con artist. And do you know he's trying to get into all of my classes? So, tsk, well, wait till he gets a look at this schedule. Excuse me. Do you know if there's a Leslie Burke in this class? - [door opens] - Good morning. Welcome to Advanced Mandarin Chinese 503. Since you're already proficient, I won't waste time with basics. Just remember, from this point on, no English will be spoken in this class. Excuse me. Oh, [chuckles], I-- I think I'm in the wrong class. You see, the schedule just has the course number. I didn't know-- No, no, really. Um, you see, I only took this class because I thought this girl I know would be in it. Hi, Zack! Oh, [speaking chinese]. I'm sorry. But look on the bright side. By spring break, you'll be able to pick up bimbos in Beijing. Yup, I had it coming and just to show you there's no hard feelings, there is an R.E.M. concert at the Pavilion tomorrow night. What do you say? Can I have another chance? I don't know, Zack. I'm still not sure if I can trust you. Oh, come on. It is a concert. There'll be 18,000 other people there. If it doesn't work out between us, who knows? Maybe you'll meet Mr. Right at the Porta-Potties. Well, since you put it that way, how can a girl refuse? Terrific. - See you. - See you back at the dorm. Hey, Zack. Am I glad to see you. I thought I was going to have to eat alone again. Actually, I've already eaten. Oh, well, that's OK. I'll just take something up to my room. Oh, no, no, no, no. You know me, I could eat any time. Actually, it's a nice evening. Why don't we just go outside in the square? - Oh, yeah, the square. - Yeah. I think I got lost there yesterday. But I'm starting to find my way around. Good. Let's get some food. - OK. - Uh, Kelly. Yeah? Oh. [chuckles] Yeah, that looks pretty tough, Mr. Rogers. You ought to take some of my courses. History of Television is great. I got an A in "Gilligan's Island." Yeah, I know. Back when I played football here, I took all the no-brainers -- Advanced Disco,  Physics of Frisbee. Hey, sounds like fun. Yeah, it was. But, uh, in today's economy, there's not much demand for a guy who can catch a Frisbee in his teeth. KELLY (OFFSCREEN): [giggles] Oh, I can't believe how late it got. I know. It's been a long time since we talked till midnight. Yeah. You remember that night in Palm Springs? Well, technically that wasn't talking. Yeah, but we used our lips. Ooh. You know, I-- I might have seemed a little distant when you first showed up, but, uh, I'm really glad you came here. Me, too. I don't know if you've noticed, but, uh, I was pretty scared at first. But I've started to feel more at home lately, thanks to you. Hm. What are friends for? You're more than a friend to me, Zack. I am? Are you thinking maybe you and I can get started up again? Actually, I think I'm already started up, halfway out the driveway, and burning rubber. Oh! Oh! Oohh! [snoring] [door opens] Hey, turn off the light! Sorry, sorry, guys. OK, I got a problem here. You see, I like Leslie, right? And she likes me. And I like Kelly. And she also likes me. I got two great girls in there who like me. Don't you just hate it when that happens? Wait a minute. Maybe I don't have a problem. You will if you don't turn off that light! I'm sorry, guys. - See, here's the thing. - (GROANS) Ah, great. You see, Kelly and I have this-- this history together, you know. I-- I feel comfortable with her. Then on the other hand, Leslie -- oh, she's exciting. I mean, she's-- she's a new adventure. They're both beautiful. Slater, what should I do? [sighs] Listen, man. I can't tell you that. Nobody can decide that but you. Well, I can. You see, Zack, it's like this. See, Kelly's an old friend. She's a woman of great warmth. She's decent and has high moral standards. That settles it. Go for the blonde. Lights off. [groans] Sorry to barge in, guys. But Zack, we need to talk right now. Uh, I know. Um, let's go in the living room. No, we can't. Kelly might hear us. Right. Uh, guys, would you mind? I should have roomed with that kid studying for the priesthood. Sorry, sorry. Look, Zack. Kelly told me you two are back together. And I understand how these things happen. And I'm happy for both of you. Whoa, Leslie, wait. I-- I can't believe how nice you're being about this. And-- I can't believe how absolutely beautiful your eyes are. Kelly had it all wrong. I mean, I like her, but not as much as I like you. Do you really mean that, Zack? Yes. Yes, I do. And I'm going to go over there and tell her right now. You just wait here, OK? OK. - [groans] - Hey, turn off the light already! Really sorry. [knocks on door] Yeah? Kelly. Alex, Alex! What? What? Would you excuse us for a minute? Oh. Is this a dream? Yes. Yes, it is. Kelly. Shh. Listen. I know you have feelings for me, right? And I have feelings for you. But as you may have guessed, Leslie and I-- boy, those are cute pajamas. Uh, thanks. But wha-- what about Leslie? Leslie, right, oh! You see, I was supposed to go to this concert with her, and I'd much rather go with you. Just wait right here while I break it off with her, OK? - OK. - OK. (SCREECH AND SLATER TOGETHER) Turn off the light! Is Kelly all right? How'd she take it? - Surprisingly, well. - [sighs] Must have been so hard for you. Wait right here. Don't worry, guys. Everything is cool, hah. Yeah, good night, idiot. Kelly, uh-- [chuckles] got to run. Bye. Did he talk to you? Yeah, but he said he was going to talk to you. I think we better talk. - Guys, do you mind? - Oh, man. [groaning and grunting] Boy, this is the weirdest dream. Hi, Slater! How's your new schedule? [panting] Classes-- spread-- all over-- campus. Need to borrow your bike. Oh, you mean the nerd-cycle? Yeah. Sorry, Slater, it's booked through January. Hm. [bike bell rings] There you are, Debbie. Jennifer, it's your turn. Let me just show you how to squeeze the horn. It's a wee bit tricky. [horn honks] "World History," "Cultural Anthropology"? Pretty big books, Slater. What are you, taking that course where you press flowers? Uh, no. I gave up my slam-dunk schedule. I re-registered for real classes. You did the right thing. So there's an opening in that TV course, huh? Oh, no. I kept that. Next week, we're covering "Bewitched." Hey, I'm in this literature course. So maybe I'll see you there. How could I miss you? Hey, Mike. Thanks. OK. Heads, I take Leslie to the concert; tails, Kelly. Kelly. Leslie. Listen-- I, I know you both must be mad. No, no, we're not. You see, we realized that you didn't want to hurt either one of us. That's kind of sweet. Yeah, it is, isn't it? And we know what terrible stress you've been under. So we decided to do what's best for you. Oh, yeah, oh, I have been under a lot of stress lately. Look, my first wrinkle. Aw. So I've been thinking Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kelly and I can go out, and then-- Oh, I have a better solution, Zack. Neither one of us is going to go out with you. Hm. Then again, stress is not necessarily a negative thing-- - No, no. I-- - It's very serious. Nuh, uh, no. So I think you should sit back, put your feet up, and have a nice, relaxing evening. And Kelly and I will go to the concert together. Thank you. Great! I'm feeling better already. [chuckles] Ah, you know what? Maybe it worked out for the best. I mean, I was pretty stressed out. And I've learned something. You should never, ever date your roommates. [door opens] Zack, the most wonderful thing happened. One of the kids has mono. I got into drama class! Oh, well, congratulations! Now, if Jodie Foster gets hit by a bus, I am on my way. Ha-ha. Do you want to go get something to eat? Sure. I know this wonderful little Mandarin Chinese restaurant. Ooh, that sounds good. Yeah. Is that a new perfume you're wearing? - Zack! - What? What do I say if no one's coming? You say nothing! Right. - Zack! - What? Nothing. - Zack! - What? Nothing. -Wha-- -Nothing in here, either. Nothing in here, either. [theme music]
