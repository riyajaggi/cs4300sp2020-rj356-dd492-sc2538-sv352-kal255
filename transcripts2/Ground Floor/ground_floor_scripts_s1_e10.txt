 Brody: Previously on "Ground Floor"... Big news! I'm going to Paris! (Derrick and Tori) What? I have to tell Jenny I love her. Now, as you all know, for the last year I've been preparing to open a new office. I didn't know where. I didn't know when. I didn't even know who was gonna run it. - I love you. - I love you, too. I really love you. Please come to Paris with me? I want you to stay here in this office and be my new Brody. - But I gave up my apartment. - That was dumb. What's happening to the old Brody?

 Forget Paris. You're going to Hong Kong. - Sir! - Ah, Mr. Moyer. What a glorious day. Have a seat. Gun to my head, I'd have to say, today is one of the greatest days of my life. Of course, the greatest day of my life was when that punk put the gun to my head. There's really nothing quite as satisfying as beating a man down with his own gun. The thing is... It's just a little complicated... this whole Hong Kong thing... with Jenny. Let me see if I can simplify it for you. I'm about to make one of the biggest moves professionally of my life, and I'm asking my best man to help me with it. - That sound pretty simple? - Yeah, sure. When you put it that way,

 it sounds as simple as beating a man down with his own gun. - But sir, the thing is... - No, no, no. I've... I've heard enough about your thing. I told you from the very beginning, that your relationship with Jenny was going to cause problems. (Sighs) It was fine as long as it didn't impact me. But that's over. And I refuse to get sucked up into your relationship. - I just told Jenny I love her. - You did? What did she say? Oh. She didn't say "Thank you," did she? No! No. No, Mr. Moyer. I'm not going to engage in any of that with you. - She said it back. - Of course she did. Now get off of my balcony before I ask you if she cried. - Did she cry? - She did. Ohh! Get off of my balcony. ♪ Synced by Reef www.addic7ed.com Season 1, Episode 10 "The Decision: Part Two" - Hey, babe. - Ooh! There you are. Okay, I've been practicing my French. Bonjour, mon petit pamplemousse. Aw. I am your little grapefruit. Anyway... Here's the thing about Paris. Keeping in mind, I love you... I love you, too. Ooh! Are we gonna be one of those couples that always has to say "I love you"? - Probably. - It's gonna be so annoying. I love you. I love you, too. (Chuckles) So... I just found out that the company... - I love you. - I love you, too. Is opening up a new office... - I love you. - I love you. And I have been chosen to open up the new office in Hong Kong... I love you. Wait, are you moving to Hong Hong? I love you. - Will you get out of here? - Yes, yes, I will. (Laughs) I will moonwalk out of here. - Can you go any faster? - This is how fast I moonwalk. Wait. So when are you going to Hong Kong? - Two days. - Ha, ha, ha, ha. This is so... Fantastic! Really? Yes! Baby, oh, my God. This is what you've worked so hard for. This is... this is your dream. Yeah, this is my dream. God, I love you. I love you, too! Oh. But what about us? Well, uh, babe, this is great news for you. Okay? We'll... we'll worry about us later. Well, what if... "Us" move to Hong Kong? Wh... what are you saying? Oh, I'm saying what if we move to Hong Kong? - I was playing on your "us" thing. - Right, no, I know, I got that, yeah. About Hong Kong. Look, I know it sounds crazy and it's sudden, but I can't imagine being there without you. So, look, take as much time as you need to think about it. - Then... - I'll do it! I'll do it! Oh, my God. "Us" is moving to Hong Kong! No! "We" is movin' to Hong Kong. That's not... no. - It doesn't matter! I love we! - I love we, too! Oh, mon fromage chapeau. (Kisses) Oh, I will always be your little cheese hat. Oh. - Whoo! I got some great news, man. - Great. I could use some great news. Really? What's wrong with you? Well, I'm, uh, kinda homeless right now, because when I thought I was moving to Hong Kong, I told my landlord to suck it. I'd offer you my place, but at my 4th of July party, you told my landlord to suck it. So... Anyway, what's your great news? So Jenny is actually coming with me to Hong Kong. (Sarcastically) Great. Great. So you get the dream job and the girl. It's like you had to choose between cake and pie, and someone invented cake pie! - Mr. Moyer? - Yes. I got us our tickets to Hong Kong. Unfortunately, we're going to be traveling like third world cattle. - You mean coach? - Oh, God no. Commercial. First class. Every great adventure starts with a challenge. Are you excited about Hong Kong? As excited as a panda with chopsticks. Sorry. All I know about China is from the movie "Kung Fu Panda." - I hate cartoons, Mr. Moyer. - Right. The point is, you're on the fast track now. And in two years, you'll be me. Do you know how that feels? I do. Because I am me and it is... Well, it's spectacular. (Chuckles) I can't wait, sir. I'm actually a little envious of you... Going to an exotic location, striking out on your own, working 9:00 to 5:00. That actually doesn't sound that... Oh, you mean, 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 A.M. To start. But the hours will eventually get long, yeah. Well, I'm sure I'll be able to squeeze in some downtime. Well, of course. I find there's only a certain number of days a man can go without sleep. For me, it's 19. I'm on eight right now, and I'm high as a kite. Hey, guys. Um, so, listen, I'm kinda homeless right now. So does anyone have a place where I could crash for a few days? Like maybe Tori? Hey, Threepeat, how you doing? I know you wanted that Hong Kong office pretty bad. You know, it's okay. I mean, would I really wanna leave my friends and family, move to a strange country, work seven days a week, and have absolutely no social life? Of course I would. I wanted it so bad. Wow, I-I guess Brody will be working a lot. But that's okay, I'll... I'll meet some people when I get a job. Yeah, exactly. So you got a work visa, then? No. Do I need one of those? Well, it says here, you're gonna need a work visa. Okay, thank you, Derrick! So how long does it take to get one? - About a year. - It's gonna take about a year. But that will give you plenty of time to work on your Cantonese. I have to learn to speak another language? Looks like you gotta learn you some Cantonese, girl. Okay, I gotta go talk to Brody. You gotta go talk to Brody. Okay. Now I'm just repeatin' stuff. Did I hear you say you're looking for an apartment? Yeah. Um, can I crash with you for a few days? Not so fast. It's gonna cost you. Okay, well, when I find my ATM card, I can float you $300. You're... you're gonna... pay me with money? Here. Here... here's your key. Let's go see your new home, roomie! (Laughs) Here she is, in all her glory. Soak... it... in. (Laughs) Where the hell are we, man? You said this was a trendy neighborhood. You live above a funeral home, across the street from a funeral home, between two funeral homes. Yeah, it's called the Funeral Home District. (Chuckles) FUHO! I've never heard of Fuho. Well, it's not technically zoned for the living. But, uh, why don't I go ahead and give you the tour? Where we're standing is what we call the living room. Now over there's gonna be the rumpus room. Media Center right back here. Kitchen over there. And over here is where... The magic... happens. - Is that a magic kit? - Yeah, I do two shows a night. Pay what you can. It'll be nice just to have an audience. Well, you know, you said this is a massive two-bedroom. Did I? 'Cause I thought I said it was a massive two bed... Room. - Where are the two beds, man? - Well, they're back here! (Beds creaking) Oh! (Laughing) Watch out! Watch out. Here we go. Huh, I guess I've never actually had 'em down at the same time before. You are technically my first sleepover. I would kill myself, but I'd end up right back here. I got your text. Hey, this is where we first said "I love you." Yeah, it's our love dumpster. Aw. We should really come up with a better name for it, though. Mm-hmm, we should. (Laughs) Um, so, could we talk about Hong Kong? Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that, too, actually. Um, the thing is... - I don't think you should go to Hong Kong. - I don't think I should go to Hong Kong. - What? - What? Why don't you want me to go to Hong Kong? You just said you don't wanna go to Hong Kong. - I don't wanna go to Hong Kong. - Well, that hurts my feelings. Well, you just said that you didn't want me to go! - I don't want you to go. - Okay, well, good! I'm not going. - Okay, that's all I wanted. - Awesome. Got your wish. Okay, great. If neither of us want you to go to Hong Kong, why are we fighting? We're not fighting, we're just agreeing loudly. - Good! Okay. - Okay. - You really don't wanna go to Hong Kong? - I mean, babe, come on. You know that there's nothing there for me except you. And you're... you're gonna be crazy busy. I know, I know. And I won't be able to give you the time you deserve. Okay, so I'll just go to Paris alone. - Right. - Yeah. Wow, this really quickly turned into the dumpster of tears. No, it's... it's still our love dumpster until we... - Think of a better name. - Come up with a better name, yeah. No, we're gonna... we're gonna make it work, okay? I'm gonna stay here, and you're gonna go to Hong Kong. - And you're gonna kick ass. - Yeah. So we'll just do the long-distance thing, right? Yeah, I'll probably see more of you on Skype - ...than I would in Hong Kong. - Totally. Just remember Skype gives me this weird chin thing. I don't want to... it's not a big deal. Just keep it in mind 'cause it's like a chin thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (Chuckles) We're gonna be great. - So great. - So great. - I love you. - I love you. I love you, too. Oh, there you are. (Chuckles) I'm having a party. I hope you can make it. - Oh! "Brody's going away party." - Hey, you didn't have to do that. Hey, you're not invited. To my own going-away party? She actually read it wrong. It's not "Brody's going-away party." It's "Brody's going away... Party!" All right, hey, anybody want a cold one? (All) No! Relax, it is just a beer. (Knock on door) Oh. Here we go. - Oh... you made it. - Yeah, I did. Despite you telling me your address was 1-2-3-4 You're-a-Dick Avenue. - It's classic. (Laughing) - Yeah. - Hey, you. - Hey. (Kisses) I have a question, is it weird that this is exactly what I thought Harvard's place would look like? I guess the good thing is, you can clean the whole place with a hose. Hey, everybody, uh, grab a glass. I just wanna say to my best friend Brody, good luck in Hong Kong, man. - (Woman) Hear, hear. - To Brody. - (Man) Yeah! - Whoo! I just know you're gonna kill it, and, uh, I'm speaking from the heart when I say... Please talk to your landlord for me. This place is a scary place. You're scared? I just took a selfie and didn't show up in it. That's 'cause you got the phone backwards. Ohh. Thank you. Hey, uh, I actually have something to say. I'm really gonna miss everyone, really. Even you, Harvard. (Clicks tongue) Aw! (Chuckles) Look, I know over the past few months I've said things like "I don't like you," "I hate you," "I wish I'd never met you." Right. And... Good-bye. Go. Leave. - It's a fun party. - Yeah. (Giggles) It's so crazy that by this time tomorrow, you're gonna be on a plane to Hong Kong. Yep, and you'll be on your way to Paris. Look at us jet-setters, just jet-settin' all around, getting all jet-setty. Yeah. (Laughs) Seriously, baby, I'm... I'm... I'm so psyched for you. - Yeah, you keep saying that. - Yeah, I know. I'm just... I'm sorry. I'm jazzed. I'm stoked. I'm just pumped, you know? Yeah, I know. - You sure? I just want you to be okay. - Yeah. Yes, I'm fine. - You sure? - Yes, totally. 'Cause you'd tell me? I mean, babe, what do you really want me to say? That I'm sad? (Voice breaks) I'm... I'm a little sad. But... you know, that's just driving me crazy because I really don't want you to feel bad about leaving. Come on, Jenny. That nothat this is about. I mean, we're gonna make it work, though. We are. We'll do the long-distance thing. You know, and if... and if we don't, it's okay, 'cause we've only been dating for three months. (Crying) So that's nothing to cry about, which is why I'm not crying. Jenny, come on. You... You know I don't have a choice. - Right? - Mm-hmm. Like what would you do if you were me? I gotta go. - No, don't go. Please. - Yeah, I have to go. Jenny, I love you. Just, don't... (Door closes) Okay, everyone's gotta go! There's something oozing out of the drains in the bathroom! Get out! Get out! It's hell of a view, huh? It'll be yours someday. (Inhales sharply) Wow. Okay, thanks. Sorry. I'm just a little distracted. I... I don't know what's gonna happen with Jenny. I know. It's hard. But if it's meant to be, you'll figure it out. You'll fly her in for the holidays, you'll talk on the phone, you'll Skype. But... God almighty, watch out for the chin. Otherwise, sure shootin' you get this thing. Yeah, what is that thing? Is that like the lighting, or the angle? It's jaw structure. You either have it or you don't. I have it. I just wish I hadn't complicated things, you know? I literally picked the worst time to tell her I love her. Newsflash... There's no such thing as a worst time. If you love somebody and you're lucky enough to be able to tell them, you tell 'em. You tell 'em 10,000 times. I love you, son. Now you don't... you don't have to say anything back. You just gonna leave me hanging here or what... Oh, yeah. I-I love you, too, yeah. Love you. Attaboy. Have a seat. It's just... (Sighs) What if I go to Hong Kong and I totally lose Jenny? What if you stay here and totally lose her? What if you give up this opportunity, and then six weeks or six months from now, you break up? Then you've lost the girl and the job. And I have news for you... The job's not coming back. Wow. Okay. That was harsh. It was just tough love. I got that from my old man. Actually, he was less tough love and more tough shit. - I just feel... - No, don't. Don't feel. You're opening a new office and you're doing it fully two years before I did. And I'm me, for God sake. Now this is everything that we've worked for. And listen carefully, because I've never said this before... I need you. I won't let you down, sir. I know you won't. Go home and get some rest. I'll meet you on that flight in the morning. And don't be late. First class boards early, and I like to make eye contact with the people in coach as they walk by. I've actually been on the other side of that rich guy stare. See you tomorrow. (Clears throat) I love you, son. - Thank you. - No, don't you give me the "thank you." I love you, too. This is the final boarding call for all first class passengers. Oh, damn it. Come on, Mr. Moyer. Give me the rich guy stare? I'm one of ya! God sake. (Man over P.A.) We will now begin general boarding, rows 15 to 59. Come on, Mr. Moyer. Oh, great. People who use boxes for luggage are boarding. (Panting) Sorry, I'm so late. Brody, what are you doing here? I couldn't stand a 20-minute cab ride without you. How am I gonna go halfway around the world for God knows how long? I'm so coming to Paris. (Woman, amplified voice) Attention passengers... this is your general boarding call for La Croix Air, flight 108 to Paris. Oh, son of a bitch. So what did you tell Mansfield? Well, I haven't told him yet. But, I think deep down, he'll respect my decision. (Mansfield on P.A.) Attention, passenger Brody Moyer... This is the final boarding call for your career. Deep, deep, deep down. (Amplified voice) I'm warning you, Mr. Moyer. Do not get on that flight. Look, this is for employees only. It's okay. I'm first class. Don't worry 'bout a thing. - God, he sounds pretty upset. - It's just tough love. (Cell phone rings) (Beep) Sir, I'm sorry. I was gonna call you. But I made a last-minute decision. - You take all the time you need in Paris. - Thank you, sir. You're fired. (Singsongy) Are you ready? (Giggles) We're gonna have so much fun. Yeah. Hey. You asleep? No, man. Not even for a second. I don't know if it's because my body's at a 45-degree angle, or that you admitted to me that this pillow came from a casket. It's kind of fun, though, right? It's like camp. You wanna hear a ghost story? - Okay. - Okay. So... - Yesterday, I go open the clo... - Stop, stop! Yesterday? I don't wanna hear a ghost story about yesterday, man. How long have you been living here? I don't know. Feels like I've lived here forever. ___ Synced by Reef www.addic7ed.com
