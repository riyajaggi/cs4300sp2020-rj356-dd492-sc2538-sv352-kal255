 I sentence you to imprisonment for life. Madlen, this woman in the photographs, remind me what she looked like. Slim. Pink coat. Blonde hair. A body has been found in a car - a Medwyn Croudace. I have no idea who he is. Erm, he gassed himself. Croudace turned down Will Vaughan's planning application a week before the murder. He's dead! Shut up, Faith.

 Just get me Corran, right? You know the deal. Steve. Hey! Alys, look at me. Tell me what you saw. A white car. It didn't stop. If she tried to punish me by hurting my little girl... The body in the dunes. Am I safe? Get me Gael, Evan. And if you put a foot wrong, then I will arrest your gorgeous wife for money laundering. Surprise! Look how much you've grown! Faith, it'll be all right. Welcome home. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

 Come in. Come in. Did you sleep? Here, tea. It's hot. Thank you. Take your time. I'll see to the girls, OK? Just be careful with Alys, please. She's, um... She's very fragile. Yeah, course. Thank you. We've had some forensics back on our body in the dunes - wood fibres and paint flakes under the fingernails. But also, there's large doses of asthma drugs detected in the hair samples. So if your theory is correct, then we are looking at an Eastern European or Russian man, no injuries, who potentially was trying to scratch his way out of somewhere? Looks like a case of people trafficking from Ireland, no? Let me talk to some local contacts. No, no. Leave that with me. You crack on with Croudace. I spoke to Mrs Howells. She had no idea why he phoned her. Well, there's a surprise. Uh, Steve, I'm phoning about Angie? How is she? Well, she hasn't come around, but she's stable. Oh, thank God! OK, um... ...take care. Yeah, and you, love. We need to meet. South Car Park - 12.30. Morning. Hi, Mam. Hello, lovely. Look at you! Alys? She's OK. I told her I'd, uh, take her to see Angie later. Angie's, um... Angie's Steve Baldini's daughter. She lives with him now. I don't think she's going to be well enough, darling. She is! Her mam texted me. I'll call the hospital later, OK? I'll go. Arthur! Hey, good to see you. Hi, Evan, how's it going? All right? You all right? I'm great, yeah. Hey, I hear you've more or less become part of the family. Yeah. Well, hey, we'd love it if you could stay. I'd love to. I'd love to. Well, carry on, then.OK. Apart from, I'll pick Alys up today from ballet. I'm going to take her to see Angie. Yeah, there we are, OK? Hello! Oh, perfect timing as usual. Right, I'm off. Bye-bye! ♪ I gave my heart whole ♪ I did ♪ I gave my heart ♪ And although it's lost ♪ It is still beating ♪ And I gave my whole soul ♪ I did ♪ I gave my soul ♪ And although I'm broken ♪ I am still breathing. ♪ Won't be long, sweetheart. Girlfriend? Work. I'll be a couple of hours. Call me if she, er... If she... Move it there to bring more stock in, and then we can... Time's up, Jernigan. You need to get the deal done before you sink any deeper. I suggest you leave before I have you arrested for trespass. Get this done today... ...or there won't be a minute where you're not worried about where your wife and three kids are. Hello, goodbye. Cerys, I need to talk about Madlen. Can't stop - money to earn. Cerys! The hell does she think she's playing at, Tom? It's got nothing to do with the firm! What she's done is totally out of order, and you know it! Can we talk about this in a calm and collective way? Morning! Geraint. Your client sent her two thugs round to our offices to invite our acceptance of her generous offer. That has nothing to do with me. It's nothing to do with the firm. It's bullshit! It's the truth, Geraint. It has nothing to do with us. Now we all know what we're dealing with here. So either Mrs Reardon makes an immediate cash offer in excess of 5 million... ...or next week, Corran Energy goes into administration, and those jobs will be on your hands. Then I will go to the police... ...and they'll happily take you down with them. The children must be happy to have you home. So far, so good. Even if Faith isn't. I suppose she... got used to things. She and Arthur seem awfully close. He wouldn't be my first choice of help. That ridiculous hair! Do you need money? If I could borrow your car for a few days? My pleasure. I don't expect you to forgive me, Evan, about the past. But I need you to know that you've always been the most precious thing to me. Things WILL get better. Madlen. Did Will ever speak about a planning officer called Medwyn Croudace? I don't know. Just have a think. Please, it's important... I don't bloody know! Faith, I... I just want you to get me out of here. I can't bear it any more. I'll go mad, I'll go mad! OK, OK. Just breathe. Just breathe. OK. Croudace was taking bribes. Who was trying to block Will, Madlen? What if Hannah... What if Hannah had heard about Will and this woman in a pink coat? I'm scared, Faith. And she thought that he... I know you're scared. I should be with Dyfan. Not here. Thanks for helping me. You're going to have to... You're going to have to help me, Madlen. Help me to help you. Please. Where do I start? Hi, this is Cerys. Please leave a message. Cerys, I can't do this Madlen thing without you. Can you phone me, please? Please? Steve? She's come round. Hey! Who? Still not speaking much. She will. Can I see her? Only if you have time. Yeah, that's brill... That's just... I'm on my way. Yeah, OK. She seems on edge. Do you think she's happy to have me back? You off your head? Of course she does. She's... I mean, she stuck by you. She's... she's never wavered. Well, 18 months is a long time. Steve Baldini, perhaps? No way. She... And I swear I've been here the whole time. I've... She's solid. She's like a rock. Well, that's good to know. The mind can start playing tricks on you when you're locked up. Nothing to worry about, you know. OK. OK, just put the pillow in the other pillowcase.Yeah. It's good to be home. It's good to be home. Yeah, can I have one? Can I have one? Go on - another one. Mm! Alys can't wait to see you again. I mean, she's hardly slept. I'm OK. The car swerved right across the road. Came straight at her. Did you see who was driving, darling? No. It was all so fast.Yeah. Just take your time. Give me a moment. Sorry about your girl. Accident? You tell me. You tell me this, Steve. Who shot me brother Paddy? A woman named Erin Glynn. On her own? I find that hard to believe. Gael's held you close for a long time now. What does she think you know? You think Gael paid the Glynns to kill Paddy? Would you bet against it? You see, between you and me, I'd say she was a certifiable psychopath. Capable of just about anything. Me brother and cousins will need proof before they give the nod. I can help with that. We'll look after you, Steve. And your little girl. Who was he? Shane Reardon. My boss. Just... sending best wishes. You leave him to me, OK? OK. Right, I best make a move. Take your time. OK, precious one? Thanks for coming. You OK? OK. Right, Daddy's got to go speak to this man. You going to be OK, yeah? I won't be long, OK? You happy leaving him alone like that? What do you want? When you were inside, there was a man named James Fletcher. He's big-time. Wants to set up a supply line to the United States via Ireland. Now, he thinks it's the new weak spot.Yeah.Money to be made. Sorry, I... Yeah. I don't recall any Fletcher. Yeah, of course you don't. That's just what you're going to tell Gael. Now, listen. You'll be wearing one of these, which is a listening device. Take it. Breeze, I'm not. It's... No.There's no fucking no. The only reason that you're sitting in this seat is because of me. Now, we're going to entice her into a conspiracy to import, and you and your lovely wife are going to disappear into the sunset. Take the fucking device. Fuck! Good. Now set up a meeting as soon as possible. Oh, and, uh, that body that turned up at the Pembrey sand dunes. Do you know anything about that? No, sorry. Can't help you. We're done. Right. You OK? Let's see if Mummy's free for lunch, shall we? Do you want to meet for lunch? No, I don't... I can't. Look, I'm... I'm just about to go into a meeting, and I'm not sure. I'm going to phone you back, OK? You've... You've pushed them too far - they're going into administration, so it's 5 million. 2 million. Final offer. It's... They're not going to accept! They will not accept 2 million. They can accept 5 million. Why would they accept 2 million? I mean, it's... Their net... The net assets is worth twice that. Well, it's your job to explain. Gael, please! I mean, what is your alternative, Faith? Hm? You can't be with your kids every moment of the day, can you? Don't say it, Faith. No need to make a bad situation worse. Last chance, Faith. I know who you are. Who needs lawyers? They're a waste of space. Bitch! Sodding bitch! Horrible, horrible bitch! We've seen dolphins, haven't we? Did I bring you the right ones? What? Hm? Oh, yes. Thank you. Oh, it's like being a kid again. Just seeing everything fresh, you know? You had any more trouble with Gael? You know, the Corran Energy... I'm dealing with it. Listen, if you need me to have a word... No, I don't want you to have a word. I better go. Your favourites! No. DI Breeze is here. Don't go eating all of them. There's a really high body count around here. Mr Croudace - what were you doing meeting him at the garden centre on the 12th of September? No idea what you're talking about. Were you handing over huge wodges of cash, by any chance? Six weeks ago, you met with him at 9am at the garden centre. An hour later, he went into charity shops, giving away huge bundles of notes. I did think that the William Vaughan murder was a straightforward domestic, but now it seems Mr Croudace had denied his planning application. And there was a third planning application on the way. This could help Madlen's case, Faith. Do you have nothing to tell me, Mrs Howells? OK. Let's start with, uh, Gael Reardon. Why are you mixed up with her? What hold has she got over you? Are you protecting Evan? You're pathetic. And neither of you have told the truth about Gael Reardon from the beginning. Don't waste my time. Thank you, Delyth. Go on, Alys. I'll wait here. Hello, love. Hi, Angie. Did your mam bring you? Dad. I'd better say hello. Evan. Good to see you. How is she? She's young. She'll mend. Was it Gael? Can I help? I'd say we're just about quits, wouldn't you? I feel for you, Steve. I really do. But if you touch my wife again... ...I'll kill you. Hi, Arthur. I know I was a bit pissed, but I remember you trying to say something about the shooting. Well, it's basic human psychology, see? Someone blazing angry comes at you with a gun, what do you do? You don't just stand there and wait to get shot in the chest. He must have seen Madlen coming. He'll run. She didn't shoot him. It was someone he trusted. Someone he wouldn't suspect. Hi. Where's Dad? Showing Lisa the shed. Hello, you.Hello. How was Angie? Did she talk to you? What did she say? What's the matter, Alys? Everything is different. I don't want him here! Oh, hiya, babes! You all right? Yeah. Yeah, fine. Evan's just been showing me the punch bag. Hm? Feels great, dunnit? Hey. There's a couple of blokes I'd like to smack, I'll tell you. I wouldn't last a round with her. Terrible about Angie, innit? Hit-and-run, Evan said? Yeah.Terrible. Hey! Right, hey, look at this. I bought you both some champagne, to celebrate! Proper stuff - none of that cheap fizz, eh? That's very, very kind of you, Lis. It's no problem. Thank you, darling. Yeah, well, you know, you don't have to drink it now, do you? Just have it when you feel like it, innit? Right... I should leave you. I've got to see a man about a dog. A sausage dog. I, uh, got a date. 32! Engineer! Hot! Right. Leave you to it. See you, Megs! Bye, Lisa! Love you! Love you.Bye.Bye! Alys'll be all right. You know, I think part of her's enjoying the drama. Hey, guys! Hey! Look... Mummy's all right. She's a bit tired. Oh, Dyfan! What have you done? Please, no! No, no, no, no! ♪ There's beauty between white lines ♪ Caught me on my blind side ♪ I'll recover, I'll recover ♪ Deep beneath the water ♪ Beautiful disorder ♪ From another, from another ♪ There was a heart here breaking ♪ Breaking ♪ There was a breath here taken ♪ Taken ♪ No prayer ♪ Hey ♪ No prayer ♪ No ♪ Washed upon... ♪ The body of an illegal immigrant turned up along the coast. Huh. They think he might have come over on one of our trucks. Baldini? Could he be making a few quid on the side? Nah, he's just a driver. He thinks you had his girl run over. Now why would I do that? Because he's become a liability. Well, you know people. Mrs Howells! Anya. Not a problem, is there? No. It's, uh... It's to do with Cerys. Oh, Cerys, OK. And William Vaughan.Uh-huh. We, um... Come in. We became involved.Hm. Romantically. OK. I care for her deeply. It's just that... I think there's something you should know. Right? Six months ago, she asked me - in confidence - for details of William Vaughan's finances. Did she? How much he owed. And... ...I told her. She has a way of persuading you. She can be beguiling. Mm-hm. Can I help with something? Six months ago, you persuaded our bank manager to break a client's confidence - Will Vaughan's. Why? Evan contacted me from prison. He said that, to protect you from Gael, he wanted to help her make a deal that would take the heat off you. He asked for one bit of information, Faith. That's it. So this... This is all for my benefit, was it? Yeah, it was, actually. Was it? That's great! Anyway, Will Vaughan could never have raised the money to build those houses. Gael had the ready cash. There was over a million to be made. A million? Yes.Shit. What? Shit. Gael gave me a... She gave me a package. I gave it to Medwyn Croudace the day after Will Vaughan was killed. All right. OK. Say Gael was trying to block planning, bring Will Vaughan to his knees so she could buy him out cheap. Why would she... Why would she kill him? I don't know why she would kill him. I don't know why she would. But it WAS Gael. And now I'm an accessory to corruption. And we're screwed. We are up shit creek. We are. Shit. Shit! OK. Look, Faith, what if... What if Evan's in deeper than we think? Oh, shit! Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh! If Gael is behind Will Vaughan's murder, she would have wanted Madlen convicted. What if Evan's been...? What did you tell him, Faith? Gael. You were talking to him during the trial. I know you were. What did you tell him? Bloody Gael! Gael, Gael, Gael. Bloody Gael! Faith? She... She must have leaked to the prosecution. Did you tell Evan about the photographs of the woman in the pink coat? Faith? I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm going to the police. Nice for the kids... I can't do this!..two parents in prison. Faith, you're not going to the bloody police. You'd end up in prison, I would end up in prison and Madlen would stay there. What we have got to do is find that bloody woman in the photographs and figure out what the hell is going on. You went behind my back. Fuck off. Broken wing mirror. I'll see to it right away, officer. The paint from your truck matches the paint under our body's fingernails. My truck and 10,000 others. This is, uh, an e-fit of a man who died roughly 18 months ago. It's funny. That's around the time you and Evan Howells were involved. Just in case it jogs your memory. Evan. Gael. Hey there, little man! Hello! Wow, hi! Haven't you grown? Wow, you're looking well. So are you. So here we are again. What's next? Well, I could do with a job. Hmm, well, we'd have to see the back of Shane first. He was very fond of Paddy. What's his interest here? He wants to seal the deal with Corran Energy, somewhere to hide our money for years, but your wife keeps screwing it up, so... Maybe I could sweeten the deal? I know someone who's looking for an Irish angle... Listen, we need to talk about the body in the dunes. You know I trusted you with a simple task. Hey, no... Shh! No. Evan. No, no! Shit, Evan! You shit! Fuck it! OK, Evan, back to business. I need you to find Diana, before anybody else does. Come on, champ! Well done, you. Thank you. Well done! Go on, give me a minute. You OK? Yes, I'm fine. Give me a minute. Come here. Get that around you. Keep you warm. There's something I-I need to, er... Go on, off you go. Hi, Lisa, it's Tom. I, um, just thought I'd call to say hello. So, hello! Sorry I missed you again. I'll try later. OK, bye. Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye. She doesn't want to speak to you, Tom. You've left her three messages today and she hasn't called you back. I think that's telling you something, don't you? She's young enough to be your daughter. Whoa, Delyth! This is none of your business. Maybe I care enough not to want to see you make a fool of yourself? Had you thought about that? No. Didn't think so. Mrs Howells. The woman Will Vaughan was seeing, we need to find her. What exactly has this to do with me? 18 months ago, you planted one of my earrings at the scene of Alpay's death. Now, Susan, I haven't mentioned this to a living soul. I think you owe me one. What do you need? Will Vaughan's phone, now, please. You should know that DI Breeze is assuming the worst about your association with Croudace. It was me who uncovered your meeting at the garden centre. I didn't even know his name. Let's have a look at Will Vaughan's messages, again. Right, what's this one? Hmm? Numeral 4, "hodynnyk". "Hodynnyk".Pocket text. Hold on. Right. Translate. Detect language. Cyrillic. Clock. It means "clock" in Ukrainian. Four o'clock. Dial the number. The number that you have called is not recognised. Shit! Please check the number... So, Mrs Pink Jacket is Ukrainian. Know anyone who speaks Ukrainian? OK, thanks, Pavel. We're just arriving at the Ukrainian market now. Yeah, I can see it - Odessa Foods. Spasybi. It's "thank you" in Ukrainian. Go on, then. Go on, what? Go on, then! In you go! I'm going, am I? Yes. What am I going to say? Think of something? Um... Blonde, blonde hair. Um, she had pink, pink coat on. It had like... Have you seen her? If I write my number down here now. Here, Arthur Davies. Listen, cheers, man. I really appreciate it. I really do appreciate it. Come on. We'll get an ice cream after I've seen the man, OK? You're a good boy, aren't you? Hey. What are you doing here? Hi! Rhodri, look! Who's there? Here we are! What are you two doing here? Uh, meeting a client. You? Um, an interview. Er, a letting agent. Friend of Beth's. It's better than nothing. With Rhods? Thought it might help. Just give me a minute. Take Rhodri back to the car for me. You all right? Yes, I'm fine. Just take him back now, please. Please. Cerys told me that you've been snooping around in Will Vaughan's finances. Yeah, I was trying to... I was trying to give her a bit of work, protecting you. Protecting me? There's an innocent woman in prison. Will Vaughan is dead. What Gael does with that information... Fuck Gael! ..has nothing to do with me. Fuck Gael. You promised. You promised. You promised me! You promised me after you went missing. You promised me that you would never lie. That you'd stop lying to me. You've kept on lying. Do you want the truth? Yes. For once, I do, yes. I'd have said anything. I'd have said anything to get that woman out of our lives for good. More than anything, I just want it to be me and you and the kids. But you're a liar. That's it. That's it. Look me in the eye and you tell me, am I really meant to believe that you were here for an interview at a letting agency? Look at me. I know I don't know everything that's going on, but I can see it's tearing you and... ...the firm apart. Maybe Tom was right to warn you off this case. We didn't have any choice. Madlen didn't have anyone. But you do have a choice now. There are other lawyers, even some who'd take her case pro bono. You've got enough to deal with. Cerys thinks you're too involved. Sometimes, there are... ...no good decisions. Sometimes you just have to survive. If you want Gael, you can get her yourself. Did you know your wife was paying off a council planning officer... What, seriously? ..who then went and topped himself? You see, the closer I look, the worse it seems to get. Especially for her. She sold her soul for you, Evan. And you? What have you done? I hope I've made enough. Maybe we could do some pasta. I like to cook proper food, love. Even though some people can't tell the difference. Don't worry, Granny. It's all going to be all right. You sound like your mother. Do you think I need to warn Faith about what she's, uh, coming home to, or...? Um, I don't think we need to add to her stress. Oh, is that the engineer, is it? Huh? Megs let it slip, she did. Sorry. No, it's all right, love. Do you know what? Me and men - we're done? Finished. I don't believe that. Why don't you stop looking and wait for them to come to you? She's right. Oh, you might be right, babes. Come here. Give me a cwtch. We love you, Lisa, and someone else will, too. Aw! Thanks, love. I love you too. But you've got lipstick on your head. You've got lipstick on your head! Diana's gone to ground. You know, she's packed in her job at the club, she hasn't left a forwarding address. I'm going to need some more time, OK? Just... Just give me a little more time. Check your texts. Evan! You don't want me to send this to Faith, do you? Goodbye, Gael. Just find Diana. Evan, are you there? I'll be there now. OK, here we go. How's that? Happy with red, Marion? Yes, happy. All right. Just a little drop for you. Tiny drop, Tom. Yes! Ah, here she is! Faith! Faith, come and sit here. Evan? Oh, thank you. Sit here. There you go. Evan was just about to say a few words. Oh, am I? Well, if you'd rather I did? Oh, no, second thoughts - we'll be here all night. Corran Energy has agreed to accept three. Take it. I don't want to make a speech. Words can't do justice to how I feel... ...surrounded by all you precious people. The only reason I'm still here is because each and every one of you have shown me more love than I deserve. And I will spend the rest of my life in your debt. So, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. To Evan! To Evan. To Evan!
