 0 HOURS MISSING SAMUEL Just send me a message. Whenever. SAMUEL I just want to make sure you're okay. Are you having fun? You think it's funny? If you had a little bit of decency or you weren't all bored, you'd all delete the video. Leave it, Guzmán. Nadia... I know you don't need anyone to defend you but... I don't deserve anyone to defend me.

 I should never have done something like that. - It's normal for people to think I'm a... - Listen to me. You can't let these idiots make you think that. You're not like that. Go now. We have an exam to do. Everyone sit down. We're about to start. You have one hour for the exam. Please, put all your books away. Samuel's missing. And do you know if he is late, or is he sick? He is never late, because if the pizza arrives cold, he doesn't get paid. And he's not sick either. If he were, that geek would have called 100 times to ask if they could please, please postpone the exam.

 Guzmán, sit down now. The number you are calling is switched off... Why are you so worried? Call his mother, okay? And if he's in bed with the flu, then everybody's happy. He didn't sleep at home. Are you sure? No one has seen him since yesterday? Okay. Thank you. Shit. 10 HOURS MISSING Police, how may I help you? Do you know what this could mean for Nadia, for her family, for her entire life? Do you know, idiot? The problem is her religion is too repressive about sex. Things would be different if it weren't. But you're right. It wasn't the little raghead's fault, it was yours. You're the one who recorded the video. Not so that the whole school could see it. So what was your intention? Something so noble and altruistic? Don't bullshit me. Your intention was to destroy my relationship with Guzmán and make us both miserable. By the way... you and I are the same. Isn't this what you wanted, for me to stop holding back? Well, here I am... uninhibited. In two days, nobody will remember the video. Trust me. Right now, all I know is... you're the only one who is not laughing at me. Nadia, I recorded the video. Hey, darling. Tell us where you are going for Christmas. Bora Bora, Maldives? I guess anywhere they're looking for cleaning staff, right? - Lu, that's enough. - Dear Polo! If you need a new cleaner, I can recommend others that are much more trustworthy. Can you please let me talk to my girlfriend? Stop it. Listen, Polo, I thought that my life could be a fairy tale, that I could be Cinderella... Quite funny. That's what they teach us when we're little. But it's all a lie. It's best that I go back to my world and you go to yours. I don't want to taint you. What do you mean, go back to your world? I've been kicked out. And my mom has been fired. And since there are no more exams, today is my last day. Doesn't Cinderella have a happy ending? Yes. Because it's a fairy tale for children. Please, tell me you're going to find him. This can't be happening. We will do everything we can. What we know so far is that Samuel's bike was found yesterday in the forest. But there was no trace of him. 36 HOURS MISSING We are going to be carrying out a search this afternoon to try and find him, or any clue as to his whereabouts. It would be good if any of you could come along to help. But do they think he's dead? Are we looking for a dead body? Our hope is to find him alive. - Tell me it wasn't you. - Ander... What happened with Marina was an accident. Do you really think I am capable of killing someone in cold blood? You threatened him in front of me. I was at home when he disappeared. With Valerio. In his bed. You wouldn't get your hands dirty. You wouldn't even need to leave your house to hurt somebody. You'd just make a phone call and get others to take care of it. Your father could have made a call, and we already know what happened to Christian. My father was fine until you came along and started talking about Samuel. What are you saying? That it's my fault? - You got him into this mess. - Relax, dude. We don't know what happened to him. He's dead. You don't know that. They found his bike smashed up in the forest. This was not a normal accident. Someone wanted to get rid of him. Someone like you, for example. Nobody wanted him dead more than you did. If I had done it, I'd give myself up to the police today with my head held high, don't you think? What are you going to do? Go to the police? Accuse your own father? Tell the truth! And those people will know you snitched. If you think they killed Samuel, what do you think will do to you? You could also have an accident. Carla's father is capable of anything. I'm telling you to protect yourself. I'm saying this for your own good. Don't do anything. So then what? Do we just sit back and fucking enjoy Christmas, as though nothing happened? We learn to live with what we've done, all right? Forever. Shit! Do you think one of your classmates could have something to do with Samuel's disappearance? I don't know anything. I'm sorry. Okay, thank you. Next, Cayetana Grajera Pando. What's going on? Nothing. I know you, Carla. Or are you going to keep this to yourself, too? Samuel is not missing. He's dead. - Samuel! - Samu! Samuel! Nadia. - What are you doing here? - Why do you seem surprised? I wanted him out of my sight, but not like this. Inspector! I found something. You don't just have an accident, run off and leave your jacket lying around. No way. Those thugs have done something to him. I should go to the police, right? Shit... I'm a fucking coward. How can I know something like this and keep quiet? We were thinking about having some Christmas drinks tomorrow at the VIP area of Barceló. Maybe you could talk to your boss and open a bit earlier for us. I'm sorry? So we can get in easily before the crowds arrive. I'm telling you that I think my best friend has been murdered and you're telling me about the glass of champagne you're going to drink tomorrow? - I was trying to change the subject. - Why? I don't know, Omar. It doesn't matter. It matters to me. I'm tired of you acting so strange all the time. Of having to decipher your every gesture, every word, every look, just to try and understand you. I guess it was those thugs. They wanted to retaliate and they got to him. You think it's normal that Samuel could be dead because of you, because of us? Baby... I was very fond of Samuel, too. It may not be normal, but it wouldn't surprise me. What do you think they're talking about on the news when they say that there's been a settling of scores? They're talking about this, girl, this. The shoes, the jewelry, this house... They all come at a price, and it's more than what it says on the tag. Yeah, and the queen never pays the price. It's always the pawn. What do you mean by that? What do you mean? That when dad got killed, that's exactly what they said to you. That it was an occupational hazard, too. Did you forget about that? That fat cat from the construction company didn't give a shit about the blue-collar guys as long as he lived like a god. I don't care how we achieved all this. What fucks me up is that we've become one of them. Cayetana. So... I'm going to start with the clothes in the wardrobe. Don't go. I wanted to talk to you, too. What's going on? I guess the principal will call you tomorrow, but... I wanted to give you the news in person. The two of you can come back to school. How is this possible? My mothers are on the Parents Association. At our school, parents are not just parents, they are customers as well. And the customer is always right. I'm very grateful to you, Polo, but... It can't be. With what they pay me there, it's not even enough to pay our debts. I know. With that, I think you'll be able to manage for a few months, at least until the end of the year. Because graduating from Las Encinas opens many doors. We cannot accept this. - Yes, you can. - No... My mothers have the money to spare and they love charity. They feel like better people for it. And so do I. There aren't many things that make me feel that way of late. But how did you convince them? I told them that even though we make huge mistakes, we all deserve a second chance, right? He's the brother of that kid, Samuel. He looks innocent, but he is not really. He's involved in dodgy dealings with the family that bought Guzmán's house, Dad. - Sheila, stop it. - Remember? It's unbelievable. And she goes to your school as well? Unfortunately. She's total trash. I call her drug-dealer Barbie. She looks like she's going to take her gun out any time. She quickly became friends with Miss Palestine, by the way. The fundamentalist. She is no saint. It turns out she gets down on her knees for more than just prayer. - Lu, please... - That's what the video shows. I can send it to you if you'd like to watch it. And then they say we Mexicans love soap operas. We have a lot of 'em here. I don't know whether we ought to take you out of that school. No, I really have fun there. Well, let's not get carried away, Dad. It's not as if Lu is an angel fallen from heaven and all the others are depraved. Of course. You're in your element with all that riffraff. But I want what's best for my daughter. I've changed, Dad. Your clothes, maybe. I love this. I have turned my life around. For real this time. I'm taking private lessons. I study hard... I know my future is very promising and I don't want to miss that chance. I practically live the life of an altar boy now. - I think Valerio is doing his best. - Thank you. Seriously. That's what he has to do. The good influence of his sister helps a lot. I know I could leave them on their own because they'd take care of each other. VALERIO Look under the table, Dad. That's really important. I think it hasn't been good for our son to be an only child. Not having someone to play with, to help him. Someone who can... Someone to help him, to give him some affection when we are not there. - Cheers. - Cheers. What... - I pay for all this. Don't you dare... - I don't care who pays for this all. Those kids are on their own all day long. They just want our attention. - Please, don't give me that psychobabble. - Psychobabble? You're always attacking them. I thought you loved me. I thought so, too. Sometimes you convince yourself that you love someone, you idolize them, but suddenly they do something and in an instant... that image you have of them crumbles, and the love disappears. You see them for what they really are. And what am I? My sister. That's all. I don't understand where Samuel was going at that time and on that road. He can't have been going home. Poor Pilar. It must be really hard for her. I know... She was out all day working, and of course, she had no idea where her son was, or with whom. Samuel is a good boy. You are a good girl. As for Samuel... I don't want to talk bad about someone who... Who knows what has happened to him. Nothing, I hope. - Dad? - Yes? I... I... I have also done things that... that I shouldn't have. What happened, Nadia? There is... There is a... a video... of me with... What? Everyone... Everyone has seen it. It is a disgrace for you, for the family... I thought that trying those things wasn't bad. I should have listened to you. I have failed you. No... My place is here, with you. Nadia, is it really so terrible? It doesn't matter. We will never see it. If it arrives, delete it. The girl it shows is not our daughter. - Did you do it? - Hold on. - Excuse me? - You heard me. I'm not playing the fool anymore. What have you done to Samuel? I'll call you back. Carla, don't go there. Tell me he is all right. Darling, I know you are... I know you're very much upset about all this. Nothing is going on. Samuel will turn up, I'm sure of it. Just like you had nothing to do with Christian, right? I promise I have nothing to do with all this. How about we order some pancakes? I don't want any fucking pancakes. Sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. 66 HOURS MISSING Ander. Did you get this photo? It's from yesterday, the search. Do you know what it is? It's Samuel's jacket. It's stained with blood, man. How did you know he was dead? I just said it. Are you all right, Carla? Sure. Well, I feel sorry for his family. First his brother, now this... Guzmán. Can you come with me? I would like to ask you a few questions. Again? Your grandparents have a country house. That's where Marina's ashes are buried. What was Samuel doing around there? If you have something to accuse me of, get on with it. Otherwise, leave me in peace. I'm supposed to be studying with my friends. Do they miss me? GUZMÁN I believe you. SAMUEL Should we meet later in a quiet place? What the fuck are you doing? Don't you know how to ring the doorbell? What's the matter? - What the fuck are you doing? - Fuck. He's not here. Let's go. Could you please tell me who the fuck those people were? - I'm mixed up in different shit. - You're mixed up in all the shit. Some thugs want to retaliate against Rebeca's mom. Fucking hell, Samuel. It's a long story, but by coming here, we made it easy for them. There is no one on this road. Well, you were the one who wanted a quiet place to talk. Well, here we are, at my grandparents'. Maybe I should disappear for a while. I don't think they will forget. They tried to run you over. - Clean yourself up. - Okay. All you will do is make them more nervous. I guess... Are you okay? CARLA I just want to make sure you're okay. What would Carla do if something really happened to me? I don't get you. This is crazy, but it may work. What? She needs to suffer. Do they think he's dead? Are we looking for a dead body? She needs to think that something really awful has happened to me. - Fuck! - Shit! How can you bleed so much? - Fucking hell! - How fucking gross! That's when she'll break. Samu! Samu! Samu! But she is a cold girl. And she's strong. Do you know what it is? It's Samuel's jacket. Guzmán. I would like to ask you a few questions. The police are all over this. Carla is standing firm. ...a desperate call in front of our cameras. If anyone has seen him, or knows something... I have already lost one son. You know this is a crime, right? We could go to prison. Okay, let's leave it, then. How are you going to get Carla and Polo to confess? We have no evidence. We have nothing, for fuck's sake. And Carla's father knows about my suspicions. I could have an accident any day, just like Christian did. Either he ends up in prison, or I end up in the hospital. That's if I don't end up six feet under. Listen. If my mother, Omar, or whoever suffers, it's a real bitch. It fucks me up more than anyone. But we're not fucking this up now. This is the tip hotline for the public to cooperate regarding the disappearance of Samuel García. Do you have any information? Hello? Lu has a headache? It's an excuse. She doesn't want to see me. Me neither. I'm going to go get another drink. Do you want any? No? Hey. What are you doing for Christmas? I'm escaping to Andorra for a few days. I'm not sure yet. Why don't you come with us? Like in the good old days, we'll go skiing, eat, drink... We can also skip the skiing part. I'm a bit broke right now. It's on me, for fuck's sake. What are friends for? What do you think? - Guzmán! - Fuck. What a shit glass. I'm going to clean up. Be right back. Cheer up, it's Christmas. Samuel's poster is on the door, but everyone is dancing. What the fuck are we doing? Getting drunk. Some more than others. Shit. Everyone is handling it in their own way. You have to hang in there. What's the point of hanging in there, Polo? We have done everything, everything, so that we don't get caught. For what? Have you done anything worthwhile these last few months? Is this living? Omar! - Baby, get me something to drink. - I can't right now. Come on, get me something to drink. I told you to wait. What are you doing? What the hell, man? Come on, it's Christmas! Ander! Ander! Call an ambulance! Ander! Do you remember anything? Your mom's really worried. She keeps asking me what's wrong with you. As if I knew... Anyway... You have to take this pill. I left some water over there for you. By the way... I'm leaving. With my first paycheck, I'm out of here. Omar... Don't leave like this, please. Do you want to talk now? I see. That's what I thought. 85 HOURS MISSING If you had caught the killer, none of this would have happened. You have fucked up all of our lives. Every one of us! My family, some rest... - Sounds good. - I like it because... I can't take it anymore. I'm sorry. Inspector. We have the warrant. Carla! What are you going to do? - Let go of me. - What are you going to do? It's over. No... Think about it. You can't do this. Carla! Where's the inspector? Azucena. Where's the inspector? I need to talk to her. - Omar, they have arrested someone. - Who? You won't mind accompanying us while we search your grandparents' country house, right? That way, if, by any chance, we find something, we will have you close by. Not at all, Inspector. The only thing is I need to call my parents first. Don't worry, we already have. Let's go. TEENAGE BOY GONE MISSING NEAR FOREST We come here in summer. You might find some cobwebs, at best. Down there. No one there either? No one. Cobwebs and the boiler. There's nothing here. Let's go. A student wants to talk to you. She is waiting for you at the school. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Let's go back to Las Encinas. Wait here. They told me you wanted to talk to me. Yes, please. Come with me. I can't believe I'm here again. What is it? What's going on? Polo? It's over. My life is over. Polo killed Marina. It was an accident. I knew. Christian knew. And Samuel found out. That's why he disappeared. Do they have any evidence? I know where he threw the trophy. It's close to the shore. It won't take them long to find it. I'm sorry. - Guzmán... - You knew. Next time you faint, I hope you smash your head open and bleed to death. I fell off the bike and some kids that were passing by offered for me to go to their house where they were having a rave. Everything got a bit out of hand there. I lost my phone and I didn't hear anything until yesterday. Sure. Do you have the names or numbers of some of those people you were with? Someone who can corroborate your story? - I just... - No, there is no need. Everything is all right. This family has already suffered enough. Thank you, everyone. We're done for today. Let me take you to the exit. Thank you for listening to me. If I had listened to you earlier, it wouldn't have come to this. But please, don't do anything like that again in your life. As soon as we have a confession or the murder weapon, tell your brother to come home. Will do. I'll have to come back for the rest. I knew, Omar. I knew everything. Since when? What does it matter? Even going one day without confessing would be enough to make me a coward, a lowlife. I'm worse than Polo. He killed in a fit of rage. I lied to everyone. I deceived the people I care about most. I don't deserve Guzmán. I don't deserve you. I deserve to have no one. Please, go. Ander, what are you doing? - Ander... Ander... - Leave! - Just leave! For fuck's sake! - Ander, calm down! It's okay. Mystery solved. You were put in an impossible situation and didn't know how to react. You fucked up. You're a human being. We fuck up all the time. If you think you'll get rid of me just because of this, you're very wrong. Congratulations. Do you think that I'm happy? Why wouldn't you be? You played me and you won. I lost you. You never had me. 2 WEEKS LATER Samuel. Everything all right? Yes, how are you? Good. Happy new year. You are putting off the inevitable. If you confess, we will be done sooner. We have Carla's confession. An angry ex-girlfriend whose father denies her story, right? Have you found the trophy? What if they don't find the trophy? It's a matter of time. Sure. Everyone deserves a second chance. Why don't you leave me in peace and look for the real killer, who is on the run? Why don't you? Which, by the way, is basically admitting that he is guilty. Let me tell you something. I think you are the one that is putting off the inevitable. Let me go, and let's put an end to this farce.
