 I'm not in the mood right now, okay? Not now, not the other day, not yesterday... What's going on? - You've had enough of me. - Come on, don't say that. No? Come on, say it. You're bored. Don't be a drama queen. Omar. I don't know, man. We should be in a constant hormone party. Fucking, kissing, going places... In other words, having fun, - not staying in like a retired couple. - Can you let me speak? If that's not what's wrong, what is it? Huh? We're together, we live together. We're more or less independent...

 and the coolest thing we do together is watch Netflix? This is a fucking joke. Jesus, check out that hunk. Damn, too bad the new guy didn't end up in our class. Him? He's not really new. Apparently, he was here on a scholarship about three years ago and had to leave. - His name is Yeray. - No way. So he's "Free Yeray"? - Fuck. - Yes. Apparently, they used to call him "Free Yeray." - I'm not sure why. - It's best if you forget about that kid. I sure have. ROOM TO RENT Are you hanging those here? Uh, Samuel, people here shit in bathrooms as big as your house. I'm just printing. I can't afford toner. Rebe to the rescue, as always. I'm fine, thanks. Sure, like hell you are. You wish. Your mom up and leaves, you have to cover rent, Carla's ignoring you and making trouble, and Polo's out of jail. Are you here to help or to make me feel even shittier? Problems should be handled like fuck buddies: one per day. - What are you doing? - Take this. I have the perfect roommate for you. Hey, buddy! Sell the car, and you can afford to live with him all year. You know what, babe? My dignity is not for sale. You lost your dignity about 200 lines of coke ago, sweetie. Excuse me. Living with dignity means having a roof over your head, idiot, no matter how good the car looks. It looks amazing. You know what? I prefer to keep seeing the world in my own color palette, which is more interesting than his gray scale. No offense. Thanks anyway. You're a huge idiot. - Yeah, a giant one. - Here. For you, sir. - What's this? - This guy's number. Yesterday, the school established a study program with Columbia University in New York that guarantees acceptance to that school. The program and tuition will be fully funded. Candidates will present individual academic projects - by the end of the year, and the winner... - Who's funding this? A generous sponsor. - As I was saying... - This happened yesterday? Because I saw Polo's mother in your office yesterday. Look... if Polo's mom's publishing house wants to sponsor it, so what? You're always... They've already bought you off. Not the rest of us. They don't need to buy us off. Polo was released. Thank you. You want to take the scholarship without feeling guilty, right? If Nadia wants to apply for that scholarship, that's her business. Maybe we should all put this behind us. - You're not serious. - I believed you, but the court didn't. I believed you over my friend Polo, my best friend since we were kids. Maybe I fucked up again. Drop it already. ♪ Mesmerizing ♪ Were you serious? - About what? - Putting all this behind us... and believing me. Polo... ...we've been friends for years. Do this for us. Look me in the eye. Did you kill Marina or not? No. I-I didn't do it, Guzmán. Then maybe I was serious. I don't know. One day, Guzmán's hungry for revenge like a viking, and the next it's all over? What do you mean? Should I not believe him now? I know you wish everything would go back to the way it was, but that won't happen. Ever. He's trying his best, and I'm going to do the same. If he believes me, I believe him. Ander, how are you going to the hospital on your own? - On foot, by bus, a ridesharing app... - Right. - What about your mom? And Omar? - They don't know and won't find out. - But... - Is that clear? Okay, fine. Fine. - I won't tell if I can go with you. - Not a chance. No? Well, that's a shame because yours truly will go to the principal's office, your mom's office, and tell her everything faster than you can buy that Coke. Your call, hot shot. Good morning. I'm here to fill out the application for the scholarship program. And it's about time, too. Can I come in? Nadia. Are you applying too? Very well. The more the merrier. I thought you wanted to go to St Andrews. And I do. Then why are you applying? This is for Columbia. Why not? You shouldn't put all your eggs in the same basket, right? With your academic record and references, you could go to any university you want. Let's see if I understand. You're telling me not to apply? The call for applications is open to anyone. Hm. I'm just saying that... those who, fortunately, can gain access to the best education through other means could perhaps leave this opportunity for people who are less fortunate. My application. Have a good day. Lucrecia! - Hi. - Azucena's right. - You don't need the scholarship. - That's not your business or hers. Are you doing it just to annoy me? Yes. Because I love to beat you. It's much more fun. And that pleasure is priceless. Welcome to the competition, hon. Let the Hunger Games begin. You don't need to keep pretending. You can come back to class anytime. - I don't need your permission. - I know. But don't do it for me. I'm sick of you saying what I want to hear and then double-crossing me later. - What do you want now? - I want you to come back. It's all over. Even Guzmán thinks Polo is innocent. Seriously? I guess that, when you feel lonely, you don't want to keep losing people. That's how I feel, at least. I just want to get on with my life, but all the people I care about keep leaving me. Even my mom's gone. Polo is out, Guzmán is getting close to him again... You two started so much shit, and everything's the same as it was. No, not everything. - What has changed? - Us. What about us? "Us," Samuel? There is no us. Let's change that. I don't want to lose you too. Come back, please. Hi. Hey. Can I sit here? Yeah, sure. I can't get used to it. I just want to get out of here and avoid the stares. - What? - Let's go. I don't feel like being here either. I never do, but even less so today. Where do you want to go? I don't know. Out. Maybe to my place. My folks are out. We could play video games. Great. That sounds perfect. It's important that you tell us everything you've seen, anything you think might be useful. Everything. Any detail could be key. Lu, since you're always saying you didn't send the video of me and Guzmán to the whole school, I wanted to tell you I won't tell everyone about you and Valerio. How would you prefer me not to tell? A meme with the gradient background? A GIF and little colored letters? I need that scholarship. You don't. Withdraw from the competition immediately. Wow. You really are smart. It takes a very special person to carry out that sort of threat. My dear, I don't think you have it in you. May the best one win. Kisses. Bitch. Beer at this hour? Who cares what time it is? It's the plan that matters. What? Nothing, just... I didn't think we'd ever do this again. Sorry if I'm getting all soppy, but... you don't know how much I wanted things to go back to normal. Thank you. Come on, you're getting too soppy now. Drink your beer. You're back. I have the world's best reheated macaroni at home. When are you coming over for lunch? Fuck. - Do I know you? - Sorry. Shit. What? What? Ander, fucking say something. Sing, dance, whatever, but lighten up a bit. Don't be a pain in the ass. I'm just not talkative. - You're the definition of pigheaded. - And you shouldn't be here. - You're right. Your mom should be... - Enough. They'll tell me what the treatment is. It'll be no big deal, and I'll go home. I don't see the fucking need to tell anyone. Well, you told me. - I mean the people who love me. - Hey, I love you. - You don't love me. I just turn you on. - It's a form of love, hot stuff. See how good it feels when you just relax a bit? Tell me about you. Tell me a secret that nobody knows. You know mine. Well... I mean, it's something, but it's not... I think that... sometimes, some girls turn me on, too. Ah. Congratulations. - Nadia, right? - No way. Worse. The marchioness. Of course. She turns me on too. She even turns Omar on. What about guys? Who? Samuel. - I don't believe you. - It's true, man. I mean, he's hot. I'd do him. Ander Muñoz? You can come in. WHAT'S CHEMOTHERAPY? Acute lymphocytic leukemia is a fast-growing cancer. That means we have to be even faster. We'll start with chemo this week. I promise we'll hit it with everything we've got. It'll be two six-week cycles, but they'll feel longer than that, to be honest. With such intensive treatment, the side effects will also be intense. It's all in that brochure, but I'm telling you now, it won't be easy to prevent fatigue, ...nausea, vomiting, dizziness... and also nerve pain in the joints. You won't feel like eating, going out, or doing practically anything. And, yes, your hair will probably fall out. It's the first thing everyone asks. Over the next few months... Ander? Yes, Rebe. I'll tell them. Okay? As soon as I get home. I promise. Yes, that too. But what I meant is... you'll die of old age. You know that, right? Carla. - Uh... are you okay? - Excuse me? You were never one to skip so many days of school, and... - Well, I'm here if you need anything. - Let's see. You keep staring at me in the hallway, you know I don't skip class, you know my name... You've only been here for two minutes, and you're already creeping me out. Sorry, I didn't want to make you uncomfortable, but... - do you really not remember me? - Creeping me out big time. Uh... Three years ago, I uploaded a picture to Instagram, and I got ridiculed and body-shamed by half the school. Body-shamed? You? No. I used to be... Well... Is this you? - Yes. - Shit. "You disgusting fat fuck." "I'd donate some clothes, but they wouldn't fit." - Okay, I get the picture. - Wait. Read... this comment. "You are the ones who are disgusting. When we hate someone, it's because they represent something we hate in ourselves. Yeray, ignore them and keep showing yourself as you are.” Did I write this? Shit. I didn't know I was so intense. When I saw a girl like you defending me in public... What do you mean, "a girl like me"? - Pretty. - Right. Intelligent. - I mean, a marchioness! - I can't take credit for any of that. But for defending me, you can. It helped a lot. Well, I'm glad I helped you three years ago. You bet it all on black, and you won. What I meant to say is... it's time to collect your prize, right? Right. Uh... I'm not too into prizes right now, but, hey, I'm happy to see you again, Yeray. We had made up. I realized there was no real evidence against him... and that I had just wanted to blame him. So we talked it over and gave each other a second chance. We were childhood friends, after all. I never would have hurt him. I'm going to make it, right? Well, of course you are. I'm crying because I'm still shocked, but of course you'll make it. You're not saying that because you're my mom, right? Yes, I'm saying that because I'm your mom. I won't leave you alone for a second. But you are going to make it. You'll get better. Go on, honey. Tell him. This is about teamwork, and we need to get on it. Fuck, Ander, I asked you yesterday. I didn't want to say anything. But it'll get obvious, and my mom will have to deal with it, so I told her. - Like I won't have to deal with it? - No. - What? - This doesn't affect you, Omar. Okay, yeah, it affects you because we're together. But we haven't known each other long. We hooked up because we were less than 500 meters apart in the app. Otherwise, we wouldn't have met. Two days later, you fucking moved in. Am I right? Are you pushing me away to play the romantic hero? To save me from the pain or some shit like that? I'm telling you that this isn't your responsibility. That's all! You should be out and about, fucking! That's what you should be doing. You said it yourself. You should be in a constant hormone party, and not here with me like this. Do you want me to leave now? Whenever's best for you. This is some party you're having here, huh? I love it. My mom's business meetings turn into parties. Happens every week. Typical. - What do you want? - A quick favor. - I need a loan. - Money? - No way. Sell the car. - Not money. It's... coca-ine. You're kidding, right? No, Rebe. You'd be doing me a favor, and I always return a favor, so don't worry. I know shady dealings go down at your house. Rebe, get the good gin from the cellar. Baby, I've told you to let me know if you're bringing a date. - A date? He's not a date. - Valerio, ma'am. Nice to meet you. - I'm Rebe's classmate. - I'm Sandra. And don't call me "ma'am." We're practically family. Family? You just met him. A pleasure, Sandra. What are we celebrating, then? It's nothing. Just drinks and snacks with friends. Sounds like fun. - Why didn't you mention it? - That's enough. I'll get the gin. - And you, get the fuck out of here. - Language! I taught you some fucking manners! Valerio, just ignore her. I'm the one in charge here. - Would you like a drink? - Don't even think about it. Of course I would. How could I say no to such a wonderful invitation? It really does look like she's the one in charge here, hm? Guzmán, listen to me. School's out for the day. They'll notice he's missing. When they see you and I are gone... We're not exactly... We need him to tell us where the trophy is. If we get the trophy, he'll go to jail. How do we make him talk? With the towel, we won't leave marks. Did you plan this? You had no choice but to make your mom believe you were dead. Well, I had no choice but to plan this. Polo! Wake up! Come on, wake up. Some of your classmates say that you were... very aggressive with him tonight. I didn't do it. But if I knew who did, I wouldn't tell you. That means you know who did it. That means I'd never tell you. Carla. - How are you? Fully recovered? - Mm-hmm. I'm going upstairs. I'm a bit tired. One thing, darling. - That kid... uh, Samuel. - What? You talked to the police when you thought he was missing. You went back to school when he asked you to... He's controlling you. How unlike you. He's not good for you.

But you're doing this to me on purpose. - You're capable of killing me. - Guzmán! Guzmán, stop, damn it! - I am not a killer! - Enough! Stop! Let him go! Guzmán, let him go! - Let him go!

We're having a great time, right? Whoo-hoo! Mrs. Robinson. Are you trying to seduce me, or is it just me? I saw you hogging all the coke as if it was yours. There’s nothing I enjoy more than entertaining guests. And there’s nothing I hate more than being hustled in my own house. Excuse me, Sandra. I didn't want to seem ungrateful or rude. I wanted some, and I've been a little short on cash lately. All that private school and fancy clothes, and in the end... - How old are you? - Nineteen. Okay, you're old enough to vote. Do you want it? - Yes, I'd like some. - How much do you want it? It helps me feel better about myself. - How much? - A lot. One gram. Get undressed. Come on. Two grams. On your knees in front of me. Didn't you want it a lot? Let's see how much is a lot. I'm cutting you a good deal. Come over here. Three grams. Look at yourself. Do yourself a favor. Look at yourself. Get out of here. It'd be your word against ours. ARE YOU SURE I WON'T DO IT? THIS IS A COUNTDOWN. You're bluffing, right? Ten, nine... Do you want to see if I'm bluffing? Five, four... You're not withdrawing your application? I'll start by telling her. She'll love it. And she'll waste no time telling everyone. Have a good day, darling. Nadia. I can't withdraw my application. I need that scholarship as much as you do. My father knows everything. I'm an embarrassment to my family. T-They cut me off. I have no money, Nadia. Right. Am I supposed to believe that? I'm not lying to you, Nadia. You don't know how much I hate... ...for you to see me like this... but I have no choice. I need... that scholarship, Nadia. And I won't rest until I get it. Even if it means losing my dignity. If you knew about me what I know about you, would you use it to destroy me and win? That's very likely. But I hope you won't do it... because you're a better person in that sense. Only in that sense. YESTERDAY WAS A SHITTY DAY I NEED TO BE WITH YOU WAIT FOR YOU AFTER SCHOOL? Are you okay, Guzmán? You applied to Polo's mothers' program. It didn't bother you the other day. It's complicated. With you, everything is. Like everything's simple with you? No, I guess not. You know that feeling when you wake up and you don't know where you are or who you are? I feel like that every day. And I suddenly remember my sister's dead. But I also remember you'll be in class when I come through the door. And that's the only reason why I get out of bed. You don't make my life complicated. Actually, you saved it. That video made me... lose a scholarship. My future. I also could have lost my family, my home, my life... Guzmán, I know it wasn't your fault, but every time we get together... Good luck with that program, Nadia. COFFEE? TEA? CHAMOMILE? ROOIBOS? I'M WILLING TO READ THE WHOLE DRINKS MENU... I'm fine. First time and first session? I'm Alexis. If you need any tips or advice on how to handle this... ...or need to trash-talk someone, you know where I am. - Thank you. - See you later. Bye. Hi. I'll get you some juice. The nurse said you'll have a metallic taste in your mouth afterwards. Are you staying? I'll see where I end up tomorrow. But for now, I'm here. I won't hold your hand. I know you want to be tough. It hasn't been long, but I know you pretty well. This takes three hours, right? Did you bring your charger?

We think we'll live a hell of a long time, so we spend all day complaining about shit, or, in my case, listening to other people's shit, which I have no interest in. What about my shit? Nobody listens to that. Even I don't listen. And by the time I realize it, maybe it'll be too late. And there'll be no time left. And I don't want to run out of time, man. I don't want to regret not doing what I want to do. Do it. Whatever you want to do, you have to just do it. Okay. I dived in the pool, and there was no water. It happens sometimes. No, all the time.
