 He was last seen last night. He is 17 years of age. 20 HOURS MISSING He was wearing his Las Encinas uniform when he disappeared. Maroon pants. White shirt, gray or blue blazer with a red trim on the lapel. You know how important these first few hours are, so let's get to work, team. THREE MONTHS EARLIER Did you get my present? What is it?

 Some cheese. They say it's the shit. Or at least expensive shit. You can shove it up your ass, Christian. Did you have fun vacationing with the marchioness? I'm sorry, Nano. - I should have come sooner. - You know what? Marina had that watch on her. However, when I arrived, it was gone. Maybe your girlfriend was involved. Maybe she even did it. Don't tell me you haven't thought about it. But of course...

 as long as your trips, seafood, and fancy watches are paid for... - none of that matters to you, does it? - No. It does matter. - It was a shitty vacation. - I bet. I'm going to the pool. Let me know when we're leaving. Hi, darling! I'm here to show the girl the house. What? What do you say? I don't know. It looked uglier in the photo. Don't start, huh? We'll need to paint it and make it our own. You'll see how good it looks. It's going to be awesome here. Yes! Here we go again. It's 8:00 a.m., Valerio. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Want some? No, I don't eat breakfast. Ander! Hi, gorgeous! Did you want me to give up on the first day of school? I'm on fire now. I see. I thought boarding school had changed you. It doesn't seem that way. It's made you even more ridiculous. Thanks for that. If I were you, I'd try to pass this year. Otherwise, Mom and Dad will cut you off. And you weren't born to be poor. I'm not worried. Whatever happens, I'll always have you. I'm being serious. Thank you... Thank you for still worrying about me, because everyone else has given up. It's my penance as your sister. Half sister, gorgeous. Hi, baby! What did you do to your hair? That was unexpected. We could go to your house after class. I planned, no actually... I sort of came up with a game... - ...if you don't get distracted. - You've gotta be fucking kidding me. WE LOVE YOU, MARINA WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU They could throw all this trash away. What happened to the watch? What's wrong, don't you like it? We can go and exchange it. How are you? How was Croatia? Did Christian like it? Polo, we need to talk. - What's wrong? - I think Christian went to see Nano, and... I'm going to see the others. We'll talk later. By the way... I'm really glad to see you this happy. For real. How are you? Long time no see. - Hey. - How are you doing? - You didn't post a single photo. - There's barely any signal at his grandparents' house in Asturias. A cow is a cow, no matter how many filters you use on it. It was sort of like a detox... - What are you doing here? - I have as much right as you do - to be here. - Guzmán! - Don't! - Stop! Azucena! - Go the fuck back home! - Get off! - Don't! - Stop! - Stop now! - Stop being an idiot! - Stop! - Guzmán! Get off of him! - Enough! - Guzmán, stop! Our wounds from Marina's death will take a long time to heal. I will need your help with the process. All of you. Guzmán, I can't even begin to imagine what you are going through. No, you can't. And now imagine you had to bump into the one responsible for that pain in the halls. Samuel isn't the one to blame. If Samuel hadn't come to this school... If he and his fucking brother had stayed in their town, where they belonged, - none of this would've happened. - Your father got him the scholarship. And you renewed it. Why? He's a good student. It wouldn't be fair. Fair? Marina is dead. My sister... is dead at 16 years old. Is that fair? I'm not going to argue with you. From now on, just so you know, if you talk to the fucking waiter, you are dead to me! It's him or me. This is not about taking sides. Yes, it is. And you have already chosen yours. Over here. One question. Valerio... - Is it important? - Sure. Isn't there supposed to be a welcome party or something here? - You think we're in the mood to party? - Have you seen these faces? Look at this. Especially after something as awful as this, these people need... to have fun. To have fun, dance, drink... Why didn't he go back to his mother? Because she doesn't know what to do with him. She sends him off to our dad whenever she can. Then, Dad gets fed up after a few months and sends him back. It's been like this forever. It must be tough. When your parents are divorced and they send you back and forth over the Atlantic like a tennis ball. Yeah, sure. It's the first day, and the guy already wants to party. I'll go with him. Someone has to make sure that when he passes out in a drunken coma, he at least has a cushion to fall onto, and his wallet in his pocket the next morning. Now you're the big sister? With Valerio? She always has been. Remember how jealous I used to get about all the time they spent together? What for? He's hopeless. Look at him... - To the field! - Better put your phone away. If you get caught using it, they'll confiscate it. - Are you a scholarship student? - See this? Pure gold, kid. You must be rich, but you aren't like all the rest. - And proud of it. Got a problem with that? - It was a compliment. Everyone get in! Rebeca. With a "c." - But my friends call me Rebe. - Samuel. Get into groups of five with both boys and girls. We're going to start with dynamic drills. Hey, come here! Hey, girl. I'm Rebe. Don't worry. I get on fine with Muslims. In my neighborhood, I've screwed them all. Let's warm up! Take your time. We need two more over here. You two, get over there. - Second group, get ready. - Hey, Samu. Your brother says hi. You couldn't go to see him? I was working like a dog to try to pay his fucking bail. What about you? Cruise with your girlfriend on your private yacht? One... two... three... He will tell people everything. He has barely spoken these past months. Like he was afraid that if one word slipped out, the whole truth would follow. So, what now? What? Damn. You're intense. Seriously, you need a vacation. Relax. He knows what's good for him. Are you going out tonight? - Polo, are you all right? - Me? Better than ever! Why did you snitch? I thought we were okay. I thought you were my friend. So did I, but you got a girlfriend and stopped answering my messages. Got a girlfriend? Lu has been by my side all summer in the North. Do you know why I'm with her? Because she always supports me. Unconditionally. That is not love. It's devotion, like you would have to a God. People that love you will tell you the truth. That Marina's death won't justify you acting wild for much longer. Do you know that you're at this school thanks to me? I made a pact with your father. I'd stop talking to you, and he'd let you stay. That's why I didn't answer your messages. You're welcome. I had a hard time convincing him to let me come back. I'm not a princess who needs to be rescued, and you're certainly no prince. I don't need you. You want a picture or what? I'd go back to my neighborhood in a heartbeat. Why did you leave? We won the lottery. Shit. What a bummer. - Are you going to that club? - I don't think I'd be very welcome. Are you going to let them decide for you? I'm going. You? You’re willingly going to a club? Why not? I'm up for it. Fuck those rich snobs, right? Omar. Where are you going? Won't you help me with these boxes? I made plans to meet Samuel for a quick coffee. Only 15 minutes, please. Where's Nadia? She went to study at a friend's house. Some girl called Rebeca. Go. The club is fucking sweet. And we're going to have a VIP area reserved for us. What, don't you want to be a VIP? Ten minutes a day, every afternoon isn't enough. I know. - Everybody knows each other here. - Everybody knows your father. When the hell are you gonna talk to him? I already talked to mine. Are you going to compare our families? No, your father is a dictator. That's why you have to stand up to him. How will you tell him that you like guys or to let you out of the house if you can't ask him if you can go out tonight? But why are you so insistent that I go out tonight? Because I want to kiss you in a club in front of people, like everyone else. I don't want to look over my shoulder every time I go near you. I want to feel free around you, for fuck's sake. This whole forbidden love thing was fun for a while, but I'm tired of it. What time? Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad! BARCELÓ THEATER Nadia. How is it going? - Have you been waiting for long? - Twenty minutes, and we're not moving. Check out the outfit. Do you know that you look like a pharaoh? Let's go. Enjoy the line, guys. Good evening, sir. We're on the list of... What was his name? Valerio. Come on, let's get a drink now! What are you doing here? Let's step outside. Relax. Let's talk about this like adults. Or at least over a drink. Follow me. You can see the bar is huge. You can order whatever you want. They know who I am. Let him go downstairs, where I can't see him! - Guzmán! - You think I want to see you? - What? I can't hear you. - Maybe you'll hear this. I'm not to blame for Marina's death! My brother didn't kill her. Really? So who did? Blow our minds, champ! Who killed her? I don't know! I'm not a detective, but at least I'm trying to find out! You know who are detectives? The ones who put your brother in prison, where he'll rot. I hope they crack his head open, so he knows how it feels. - Guzmán! - That's enough. Fucking hell, Ander! Valerio, could you please take care of this? - Leave him alone. He's a good kid. - Sure! He's your boyfriend's pal. How brave you've become. You're taking his side, right? Guzmán, you're my best friend. Here's a word of advice: stop forcing people to take sides. You'll end up finding yourself alone. 23 HOURS MISSING Inspector. Excuse me. Why are we looking here? We know that he left the party around 10:00. He took this road, and that was the last time he was seen. Inspector! This way! We found something! - I don't like seeing you like this. - Well... Let's see if you can pull a few of my strings and make me smile. That's why you want me by your side, right? So you can control me like a puppet. Christian, I'm not with you because of what happened. Before that day, I had already kissed you, fucked you, and laughed at all your bad jokes. I already really liked you. Why can't we go back to the way we were before? Because Nano wasn't in prison because of me before. They have no evidence against him. He will most likely be released. Bullshit. Prison is full of people like Nano. His only crime is not having the dough to hire a decent and capable lawyer. So what about you? Do you want to end up like him? Because if you admit that you lied, you will be an accessory to murder. You know that, right? Why throw it all away? You have such a great future ahead of you. He was thinking of telling you himself, but... My father has got you a place at one of the best universities in the United States, in New York. You won't need to worry about your grades. It's the chance of a lifetime. Life is a real bitch. If I have to betray my brother in order to achieve that, that's not life. It's nothing. It's unbelievable that you had him as your boy toy for the summer... But how long is your relationship with that Neanderthal going to last? It's over. MOM That ain't your color. I've got one that could look totally Gucci on you. Here. Relax. Not the one I'm wearing. Not everyone can pull this off. I guess it will sound ridiculous to you, but I think I'm doing something I shouldn't. I know. But doesn't it feel good? What? I'm not paying an arm and a leg for a rum and coke. I might be rich, but I'm not an idiot. They don't give it a rest. It's never to your face, always behind your back. If it was behind my back, I'd be happy. When are you going to answer him with a good slap? What should I do, sign up for tae kwon do classes? I'd need to win the lottery, too. I will teach you how to box. Boxing? You? What does he think? - Come here, you smartass. - What are you doing? What do you mean "what am I doing"? I'm going to teach you. - I even have a punching bag for training. - Where? In the basement at home. I'll think about it. Sure... My house is haunted, right? Dad, I don't know what to do. I think he's going to talk. Don't worry, darling. Enjoy your night out. The VIP area is here. All right? I don't need that shit. Are you sure? I think you're the one that needs it the most. What do you know? Look, Guzmán. The way I see it, you have two options tonight. You can be you... or you can be happy. Listen, I'd screw that guy after four beers. That one, after two. That one... Wow, I’d do him after an alcohol-free beer. I would even after a Diet Coke. What about you? I don't drink. I wouldn't know how to play. It's your loss. What's in it? A bottle of whiskey! Sorry! I'm really sorry. Oh my! That's definitely a sign from above. Well, he doesn't exactly look like an angel sent from Heaven, if you ask me. Tonight, I'll be anything you want. An angel... A demon... Anything you want. - Wow, he's talking to me. - Why wouldn't I? For the same reason as your friends. Because of where I'm from, how I look... I don't care about where you're from, how you dress or whatever... I'm not that superficial. Who do you think I am? The only thing that matters to me is how hot you are. Hi! We haven't been introduced. - I'm Lu, Valerio's sister. - Ignore her. Half sister. Nadia, would you excuse us a moment? Bye. I need to talk to him for a second. Let's go. I'll see you later. Yeah, go talk to him away from here. Can't let him catch lice. Wait for me at the bar. Do you think you can fool me? Excuse me? I've met people like you before. - Have you? - Yes. They come from nothing, suddenly they make a fortune and buy a mansion... They show up at school looking like reggaeton singers with 24 karat gold earrings. Just like you. And their families earned their money through some shady business. Practically always drugs. Is this all because we ended up with your boyfriend's house? I don't know, maybe... Call me crazy, but... if they hadn't got into "shady business," they wouldn't have had to sell it. Look, I'm not going to give you any advice, gorgeous... Don't go near my brother. Of course... You people are against drugs. When you go to the bathroom in threes, it's to chat? Of course. We're hypocrites. That's what we are really good at. That's why you're so proud of your family that you go around saying that you won the lottery. That's just classic. Welcome. How are you feeling? Fine, but my parents are getting a divorce. - I think it's my fault. - What? Forget it. I'm really glad to see you like this. Fuck, yeah! The three of us all together! Where are you going? To do what I should've done three months ago. And what about me? You don't care about me anymore? You? Go back to Polito. You two are made for each other. You're not coming, are you? Fine, I'll find somebody else to kiss. Nadia. What did you give Guzmán? Happiness. You want some? All you do is give me a headache, Valerio. Don't even think about doing something like this again. What happened to you? We used to have such a good time. Did you forget about it all? Christian! Christian. He had a severe stroke. It'll take time for him to get back to normal. Where were you? Why was your phone off? I was studying. With a girl from school, wasn't it? Who is this boy? What were you doing? No, I... Don't worry. I'm not into girls. But who are you? - I'm a friend of... - Nadia's. He's a friend of Nadia's. From school. What's that smell? Mom, I haven't been drinking. Yes, I did go to a club, but somebody spilled their drink on me. Why don't you stop lying once and for all? It's no big deal if she did have a drink, right? You'd think she was a terrorist? Sorry. I mean, I have a lot of Muslim friends. Fuck, shit. I shouldn't say swear words either. - You should go. - Please. - Omar, I just wanted... - Get out of here! I can't! - Finally! - This feels good. Look. I lost a sock. Who loses a sock that easily? I left with two. Now I have one. But why? How do you even go about losing a sock? - Very easily. - For real? I can tell you a really good story. I know a girl who went out on her own. - I wasn't on my own. - I'm the one telling this story. She went out on her own wearing a beautiful black lace bra. Where did I put it? When she got back home, she wasn't wearing it anymore. No, no. She wasn't wearing it because you were wearing it! - In fact... - It looked fucking good on me! You're crazy! I missed this. I missed you. Really? Always? We said that this would never happen again. I'm your sister, Valerio. Half sister. Why don't you reply? Let's go back to yesterday's subject. Open your books to page 104, please. Excuse me for a second. Your classmate Christian... had a motorbike accident last night. What kind of accident? It seems that he had been drinking and he hit another vehicle. - The car fled the scene. - Did they say how he's doing? Only that he's in critical condition. He's been in surgery all night. - What are you doing here? - My father was admitted because... - Luckily, it was just a scare. - Do you know anything? About Christian? The doctor just came. He's alive. Which is a miracle, apparently, given how badly he was hit. So will he be all right? I don't know, Samuel. The doctors say it's not looking good. What? He definitely won't walk again. I don't know anything about this, Polo. It must have been an accident. He was drunk. Anyone could have run him over. Are you still there? Anyone... Polo. What are you doing? Are you all right? Relax, man. What's wrong? Polo? Polo, what the hell? Polo! Polo. In the backpack. - What's with the backpack? - In the backpack. What's in the backpack? - My pills. - Where? Where are the pills? Shit. Why do you have these? How long have you been taking them? How many? Dad! What are you doing here? I've come to see Christian. They told us that they won't tell us anything new till tomorrow. You must have spoken to the wrong person. I'm going to have to talk to him alone. I think I can help him. His parents have agreed. - You... - Can we go in after? It'll be a long conversation, and it's late. - Why don't you guys go home to rest? - I'm not tired. You'd rather be tired in class tomorrow? I'm saying it for your own good. And Christian's. He and I have important things to discuss that might help him. Get some rest. I'm not leaving until I can see Christian. Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough, kid. Come back tomorrow. Listen, you must have a lot of friends here, but you don't own this hospital. Not yet. You don't decide who stays and who leaves. And I'm staying. Did I make myself clear enough? I'm staying, too. All of us. And so am I... I suppose. What are they talking about? Switzerland? One of the best hospitals in the world. They will operate on him tomorrow, and then he will undergo a few months of intensive rehabilitation. Who knows? So, is there a chance that he will be able to walk again? There always is. Where there's a will, there's a way. And where there's money. Because that place is super expensive. How will you afford it? I see... I wish I had in-laws like that. His parents are happy. What about you? How are you? How do you think I am, Samu? What the fuck do you want me to do? What other option do I have? Guys, it's very late. And Christian has an early flight tomorrow. It's time to say goodbye. As soon as he's feeling better, we'll get you a couple of plane tickets so you can visit him. Champion. Look after Samu for me, okay? Don't worry about me. I will. Miss Acapulco... I know you were crazy about me from the start. I'll give it to you when I get back. Sooner or later, you will fall. Someone will bring you down. I hope I'll be well enough by then to dance on your fucking grave. It was all very strange. Christian knew something. I think so, too. They bought his silence with the clinic. I knew it! It was all because of the marchioness and that watch with the red strap... I had nothing to do with it. Nothing! Do you believe me now? I never thought it was you, Nano. So why didn't you visit me before? Because Guzmán is right. Even if you didn't hit Marina, if they killed her for that watch, they killed her because of you. Because you stole it. You decided to blackmail those people. You gave it to Marina. That's why I will never forgive you. And you'll let me rot in here for 20 years? No, I won't. I'm going to do everything I can to get you out. And I'm not just talking about paying bail. I'm going to do everything I can... to find those people and make them pay. I swear I will see it through to the end. No matter what it costs. No matter who goes down. Here! Samuel! - Samu! - Samuel! MISSING SAMUEL GARCÍA DOMÍNGUEZ Samuel! Samu!
