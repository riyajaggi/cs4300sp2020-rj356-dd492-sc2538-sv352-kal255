 - What are you trying to achieve? - We want him gone. I DIDN'T WANT TO KILL HER... I HAD NOTHING AGAINST MARINA. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE, EVEN YOU. Hey. Are you okay? Leave me alone. - Polo. - Hey. - What the hell are you doing? - Right now, he needs to be alone, okay? And I need you to leave me alone. ♪ Savor the taste, savor the pain ♪ ♪ I don't expect you to release me... ♪ - He's got the balls to come here? - Forget him, please, Valerio. - Okay? It's not worth it. - ♪ I'd never ask you ♪ Polo, honey. What happened? You're back early. We have an exam first thing tomorrow, and I have a lot to study. What exam? - Uh... well, it's... - Polo. The principal called this morning. She told us about the Twitter account. Why didn't you say something to us? I don't want you to look at me like they do. They deactivated the account. Yes, Mom, one account's been deactivated. Just one. As if that'll do any good. I don't want to go back to that school. Seriously. That'd be like saying they're right. You have to be stronger. Be a man, son. You know what I mean. Well... if it isn't Las Encinas' own Bill Gates. How about if we skip training and study together? Psst. Hey, I'm talking to you, man. Okay. See you at my place in an hour? Okay. Ciao! Thanks for the lift. I just want to introduce myself to your parents. Fine. As long as it happens sometime this century. Hi, Mom. What's wrong? Are you okay? Is Dad all right? I found this university brochure with your things this morning. Dad... Dad. Look, Dad... This program is a great opportunity. My only opportunity. What other options do I have? You, all alone there? You're just a girl. She wouldn't be all alone. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you. - I'm Malick, Nadia's friend. - What are you doing? Uh... next year, I'll also be studying in New York, and... I'd be happy to take care of her. My dad studied at that university, and he speaks highly of it. Thanks to his studies, he diversified his grandfather's gold mine business, and now he has the biggest telecommunications company in all of Africa. I think it's a great opportunity. Why haven't you told us about him? Um, uh... A-Actually, I wanted to come here and introduce myself first. And... ...and ask permission to take Nadia to the Madrid mosque. I go every week, and it's a pity she can't go more often. Hmm. Fine. What happened? - Nothing bad. - Nothing bad? Since when are you the bearer of good news? Mind coming to the police station with me? The prosecutor handling your brother's case seems willing to drop the charges. Your brother could come back as a free man. And your mother as well. They wouldn't need to hide anymore. What do you mean, "seems willing"? He already has doubts due to the lack of evidence against Nano, but... I believe we can totally convince him. You "believe"? We went to the same school. He sat next to me. - We've been friends ever since. - Right. That's how things work, right? Underhanded deals among friends. Power isn't fair. But for once, you can make it work for you. All we ask for is one thing in return. We've been monitoring Sandra López Gallego for a while. Your friend's mother. We know you've run some errands for her, but we can't use that. What we need is evidence. We need someone who can enter her house without it being suspicious and plant a small listening device. I'm not doing it. If it's because of your friend... Her name's Rebeca. Think about Nano... and your mother. Think about your family. Think it over. Darling, are you okay? Yes. Let me know if you need anything. I ONLY USED MY GIRLFRIEND SO THAT I COULD FUCK CHRISTIAN. MURDERERS HAVE A LITTLE HEART TOO. Another tweet. Your friends are really something. Samuel isn't a bad person. - And neither is Guzmán. - Right. He can't be a bad person if you went out with him. Know what? He's a Christian version of you. You both think you're knights in shining armor who have to rescue me. I don't need to be taken care of. Excuse me? I wasn't planning on it. Oh, please... It's true that I'll be in New York next year and everything, but you don't need to see me if you don't want to. I only said that to convince your dad. So... So much for Allah's perfect son! You lied to my family? Thanks to that, you'll follow your dream, and they won't worry about it. - That's not so sinful, is it? - Right. So, you decide what's sinful and what isn't. I take certain liberties. I stray a little to come back with more gusto. What liberties? If you want to know, come to the Silicon Valley party. No. My parents don't let me go to clubs. They will if you're with Allah's perfect son. - Where the hell were you? - Oh, shit. - Sorry, my phone died. - Really? Well, maybe it's broken 'cause the messages I sent you showed up as "read." Look, Samu. I don't know what's up, but I can take a guess. I wasn't born yesterday. If you want to be a marquis, tell me to fuck off, and we can both stop wasting our time. You met up with her again, right? - I was with the police. - No way. Yeah, about my brother. Same shit as always. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm losing it. I don't know why, but I feel insecure around you. Me, who would've guessed? What can I do to fix that? I don't know. Maybe you could come over here and stick your tongue down my throat. Come on, let's hit the books. Were you serious about studying? - Sure. - Since when do you want to study? Since I don't want to end up like my mom, in seriously deep shit. That can't end well. Oh. So, now you're responding to messages again? CAN WE TALK? IT'S ABOUT POLO. It's Omar. What's going on? Well, well, well... what are we celebrating here? It's a private party, freak. Sure. Does this have anything to do with those messages? Don't you have a line of coke to snort or something? Is that an invitation? I love it! An invitation to leave. This is my house too. Just so you all know, okay? We just want to talk privately for a moment Okay. - Have a drink. Make yourself at home. - Thanks. Can we get this fucking charade over with? - You need to stop this. - We owe it to Marina. That's not true. You're doing it for yourselves, not her. Because you need revenge. No, we don't need revenge, but we won't let a killer go free like nothing happened. Life is too short, you know? - It's not worth wasting. - What the fuck do you know about life? - Why do you keep protecting him? - Because Polo... Polo tried to kill himself. Holy shit, Las Encinas... I told him I'd tell on him if he didn't turn himself in... and he almost killed himself. Wait, are you saying this to get me to forgive him or forgive you? - Guzmán. - Let me tell you... he deserves everything that's happening to him. I hope one day you get what you deserve, too. Are we done here? Mm! There'll be a photo-call, over 100 guests, and the best catering in Madrid... It's not every day that your company goes public, is it? Hm. - What color are you going to wear? - Why? - Are you buying a tie to match? - No. A car. That's all I am to you, right? An accessory that matches your new car? You know... those movies where the fat kid with the sweaty palms never gets invited to the party? He never gets invited to anything. Well, that's me. Used to be me. And now, it's my party. I choose who gets invited and who doesn't, and I'm taking the most wonderful girl in the world. I just want everything to be perfect. And you are the center of it all, so all the accessories have to match you. Tell me what you want... anything... and it'll be yours. Yeray, what I don't have can't be bought with money. Well... - Thanks for driving me home. - That's okay. Good night. B-B-But wait. What time should I pick you up tomorrow? Yeray, I don't know if I can go, after all. Why not? I mean... Who's that? My dad. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. I'm Yeray. - Carla's classmate. - Yes, I know who you are. I saw you in the latest issue of Forbes. Impressive. - Congratulations on your IPO. - We're throwing a party tomorrow. I was just telling Carla... Why don't you and your wife come along with her? Of course. We'd be delighted. We'll be there. Pleased to meet you. What are you wearing the uniform for? You have chemo today. I'm not going. - What? - I'm not going to do the chemo. Not worth it. You saw the chances. Ander, we've talked about this. I know we talked about it, but I'm fed up... with this crap about staying strong and optimistic. All this stuff about fighting till the end with a smile on my face. Can you imagine that kind of pressure? I'm sick. I don't have the strength to go. Don't make me feel bad about that too. - I just want to be by your side. - I want you by my side, too. But support my decisions. Don't decide for me. Psst! Look, Polo isn't here. ...of the collective unconscious. Maybe something happened to him. I wish. What could've happened to him? He's scared shitless. That's all. Samu. I came up with our next tweet. We'll let everyone know Polo tried to kill himself. - Guzmán, man... - What? It's his sister, Samuel. I don't know what I'd do if anyone touched my family. What if we wait a little? - Maybe this was enough. - Why do you think that? Guzmán, Samuel, are you following me? Come on. Let's say heroism is a choice... Polo, you have a visitor. It's Cayetana. He's not answering. You should go. Okay, give me a second. Let me try this. What are you doing? Let me try this, please. Polo, it's me. Polo... Come on, go to school. Andrea, let's let them talk alone. We'll be in the living room if you need anything. Okay, thanks. Thank you. - Let's forget about Polo, okay? - A bottle of champagne, please. - Are you going to let him come between us? - Get away from me, okay? Here you are, guys. ♪ Hey, I really know That this is gonna hurt ♪ ♪ I'm gonna miss you being in my head ♪ Hello, sweetheart! Where's Mom? In bed. She has a stomachache. Go on, get changed. I want to get there early. - I'm not going. - What? Why not? Why should I? I'm not going to embarrass myself looking for investors to save the wineries. Do you know what Yeray drank at dinner? Coca-Cola. He knows nothing about wine, and he's not interested. Well, I don't know... he seemed very interested to me. I'm not going to go there and put on an act with you. - Carla... - I'd rather stay in and look after Mom. - I'm taking care of her too. - Really? Yes. She's not sick. She's devastated. She just found out we are on the verge of bankruptcy. So... if you want to take care of her... you know what you have to do. Well, well... Don't you look elegant. Come here, give me a kiss. Hey, I'm glad that you're okay. - That was some scare you gave us, damn it. - You almost got me killed. Is this how you talk to your future mother-in-law? - We're off to a bad start. - You're playing with fire. The thugs, the police... Why don't you stop? Oh, Samuel, you're a good kid. - Thanks. - No, that wasn't a compliment. So tell me. Where has that gotten you? You live in a dump, you work for a pittance, - and let's not even mention your brother. - Should I be an asshole, then? You need to do what is best for you and your loved ones. And if you screw someone over along the way, too bad for them. And if that makes me an asshole, so be it. And as for you, you'll see. Where has being a good kid gotten you? Hmm? ♪ I see shadows crawling in my sleep ♪ ♪ The silhouettes are ghosts Of you and me ♪ Yeray, congratulations. Wow. I wasn't expecting to see you here. Carla convinced me. She really wanted to come. Well, that's not what she told me. Uh... well, excuse her. I don't know where her head is lately. Why don't you come by the winery one day and we'll make it up to you? Anyway, you might be interested. We're looking for investors. I'd like to tell you all about it. Sure. I'm sorry, but they're waiting for me. - Enjoy the party. - We will. - Excuse me. - ♪ Gotta shake the tree ♪ ♪ Don't wake the birds and bees Till you shake the tree... ♪ Yeray.

Is everything okay? Everything's fine. Holy shit. Is this a club or a retirement home? I need to go to the bathroom for a second, okay, hon? - How are you? - I'm fine. - I'm sorry. - What? When you saved Polo's ass, I thought you were a coward. But no, you were being brave. You did what you had to do to protect your family, even though you had to pay a very high price. I get it now. I didn't have to sacrifice much. You lost Lu, Guzmán, and me. I'd known you for all of five minutes. In five months, I won't see you again, and in five years, I won't even remember your name. Samu? Holy shit. What's with the long faces? What do you say we have a drink, guys? - You've gotta be fucking kidding me. - That motherfucker. - So much for "maybe that's enough," huh? - Come on, guys. Now it's time to go grab that drink. Come on, let's move. Let's calm down. It's all right. Testing, testing. Can you hear me? Good evening, everyone. Thanks for coming. Uh, as you know, this all started with a dating app that was so great, none of our users needed to have it installed for more than five minutes. - That's a bad joke, but it's a good app. - Hey, I'm with you. It all started as a dating app... but now... it's become much more than that. Now... You're too nice for your own good. And I'm an idiot for listening to you. People here do whatever they want, Samu. - ...more than a date or a hookup. - I'd beat his ass. Our users want a comprehensive experience. They want to... - Guzmán! - I'm going to the restroom! ...they want investors, even travel companions. Our VIPs... You're right. Okay, but where the hell are you going? Ready? Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... I want a gin and tonic. What about you? You drink alcohol? Don't tell your father. Or mine. Okay, okay, so are these are the liberties you take? Imagine you could choose three free passes for tonight. Mm-hmm. I've already chosen one: alcohol.

He brought it on himself. Polo wanted to die. No, no, that's not true. - Please. - No. I'm begging you. Don't tell anyone what happened. Please. What do you want, Valerio? Who sent you? Guzmán or Samuel? What are you saying? No, it's not like that. Not like that at all. I'm not one for obeying orders, and I don't like bullies, either. - Okay. - I don't like how they look at you. How do they look at us? The same way they've looked at me all my life. You don't have to hang out with us out of pity. Who said I'm here out of pity? I'm here because... because, c'mon, you guys are the most interesting couple here. - Sure. - Who? I mean... are you talking about us? Yes, Polo. And, yes, I know everything. Your threesome with Christian. That really turned me on, by the way. Do you know why? Because you're different. ♪ I'm gonna build... ♪ - And you, young lady... - Mm. A top fraudster who fooled us for months. - Give her a big hand! - No need, thanks. You are... Wow! You are fascinating. Much more than when you were just another dull rich girl. Hm. Fine, Valerio, but... I'm not as fascinating as you. I mean, you did snort your entire family fortune up your nose. Exactly. Absolutely right. How do you see it? 'Cause I think it's crystal clear. We're unique. Let's drink to that. Cheers. I know what I want to spend... - my next free pass on. - Oh, really? Okay, surprise me. I want to kiss you. - No, no, no. - No, huh? - No. - No. No problem. I'm going to kiss you. Damn, what a plot twist. Forget it. Samuel isn't answering. I guess it's not... What if we look for him and throw our own little party? Hello? No, no... I don't think so. - Guzmán, go home. - He's the one who should leave. Come on. Excuse me, have we met before? Are we friends? We're not, are we? Then get out of my sight. Get lost! Why don't you leave him alone? For fuck's sake. He had it coming. I'm not taking it back. He's sick, for fuck's sake! He's sick? What did you just say, Omar? What's wrong? What does he have? So you kept quiet about that too? You told him? - Sorry, Ander, I had to... - I told you not to tell anyone. It's my business! What did I do to deserve to be left out of the loop? Nothing. You didn't do anything wrong. In fact, you were right. I kept Polo's secret, and it's eating me up inside. No way. What? Don't tell me that's why you don't want to undergo chemo. What do you mean you don't want to? Get out of here, Omar. - Excuse me? - Go away! Ander. Why don't you want to undergo chemo? Do you want to die? You're going to the hospital, even if I have to drag you there. No matter what you did, it has nothing to do with it. Nobody deserves that. Excuse me. Can I have another gin and tonic? What's this? Didn't you used to wear a hijab even in the shower? It's my free pass. Your what? Explain it to him. He's my brother, Omar. This is Malick, a friend. I just told Nadia that... it's good to take a break from the rules so you don't explode one day and say, "To hell with it all." Maybe that's the secret to not ending up like me. Um... Omar exploded and said, "To hell with it all." He left home. Uh, oh... why? I don't get along with my father. And he can't handle having a gay son. Oh. ♪ Where you're calmed... ♪ - I-I didn't know you were... - Gay? Yes. Yeah, I'm gay. Got a problem with it? - No, of course not. - Right. Too much of a free pass for you, Malick? Anyway, I have to get back to work. I'm going back in. Mm-hmm. ♪ I'll go wherever you go ♪ Let's have one last drink and go home. - Last round? - Last round. - All right. Last round. - Okay? - Okay. Champagne? My favorite. - Okay. Last one. - Bartender! Bring me a bottle. - Okay, okay. Last round. - Do you like him? - No! - No, no, what? - Relax, relax. I'm just... glad someone can bear to talk to me. - Finally. - It's fine if you like him. I wouldn't mind if... - I wouldn't mind... - Okay. - ...I don't know, trying... - Okay, enough, enough. Excuse me. I hate to interrupt, but you're looking a bit shy. - What's up? - It's him. - Let's go for one last dance. - Not me. Not me. - Come on, one last dance. - You go ahead. Why do you care about what these people think? Okay? Polo, you're not what they think you are. So now... you're going to have fun and have one last dance with us. The last dance.

As long as we don't sleep. Come on, let's go. Hey, I'm going to the kitchen to get a drink. Okay. There's water in the fridge. Polo. We read about... on Twitter... about... I'm sorry.
