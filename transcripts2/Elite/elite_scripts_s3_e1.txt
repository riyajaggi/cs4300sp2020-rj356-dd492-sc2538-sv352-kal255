 GRADUATION PARTY FIVE MONTHS EARLIER But... that can't be true. All right. Thank you. He's been released, hasn't he? - Do I really have to go back? - Why wouldn't you go back? Did you do anything wrong? Then, you should go back... and with your head held high, okay? Go on, get dressed. Why the hell didn't we hear he was released?

 For the same reason we never heard he was locked up. One of his moms is very powerful. She owns newspapers and magazines. But that won't get him out of jail. Do you have anything to say? - Or will you just keep quiet as usual? - At least she finally talked. Some people knew and never said a damn word. Ander? Holy shit! You knew too? So, everybody knew but me? Lu, stay out of it. This has nothing to do with you. Correction. I have nothing to do with you. I just would've liked to have known that the boy sitting next to me was a fucking killer. - Creepy. - Polo didn't do anything. And we're supposed to believe you of all people, right,

 Liar Barbie? Should we remind the class who you are? No, that won't be necessary. Thanks. Um, look, all they have against him is a statement from a jealous ex. You really don't get it, do you? In other words, the whole show you put on was totally pointless, wasn't it? - What a bummer, man. - Like we needed your opinion, lowlife. - Excuse me? - Sit down and listen up, please. Your classmate has been released on bail. This means there are charges against him, and he's still being investigated. I've told his family that, given the circumstances, - I cannot allow him to come back. - So, he won't graduate, right? Fortunately, it looks like all this will be resolved soon. What? The judge has ordered a confrontation between Polo and his accuser tomorrow in order to compare their accounts and decide whether to charge him formally or to drop the charges. I know it's hard to distance yourselves from this, but I urge you to do it for your own good. This week, we have representatives from the world's best universities coming to meet you. And with a bit of luck, you might be accepted to one or even be awarded a scholarship. This is a crucial moment. There's a lot at stake. Stay focused. Don't let the past ruin your future. Good morning. Merry Christmas, happy New Year, happy holidays, happy everything, everyone's happy. Leave. - You like it? - Now. - What are you doing here? - Going to some class or another. - Excuse me. - Hey! - Why aren't you in Chile? - Because I'm a responsible student... and I'm here to finish the school year. Imagine that. Where are you sleeping? Who are you staying with? Who needs to sleep here? Oh, please, babe. This is not a game, Valerio. You know what Dad will do to you when he finds out you're near me. With a little luck, he'll buy me another ticket to Chile, and I'll be able to live comfortably off it for a long time. Let me make this clear. Let's see if you can get this through that drug-addled head of yours. Dad'll kill you when he finds out you're around. And I don't mean that metaphorically. Of course. I understand. Because, after all, I'm the one who's guilty of corruption of a minor, and you're the pure and virginal victim, right? Because that's what you told him. Did you bat your eyes at him when you said it, too? Do you know why he believes me? Because Iam a model daughter. Good, healthy... And, above all, a liar. If you'll excuse me. - What are you doing? - What you asked me to do. Distracting you when I catch you obsessing. - Do you need to do that by hitting me? - Well... I can think of another way. Come on. ♪ She want a Rollie, Rollie, bro ♪ ♪ Rollie, Rollie, oh ♪ ♪ Mami want the dough... ♪ Here, start playing. - Seriously? - Come on. Pretend I'm not here. Look at the TV. All right. What game should I play, huh? A fighting game? With buff guys? Any, man. What difference does it make? Just shut up, play, and enjoy yourself. Hey, what's this you have here? What do you think, Omar? Huh? - The usual. - No, I mean here. On your groin. It's like a small lump. Look. ♪ But we keep it on the low ♪ ♪ Nah, I won't think about ya I ain't trippin', I don't know, yeah... ♪ - I don't know. I have no idea. - Eh, it's probably nothing. ♪ Fuck you and somebody else... ♪ What could it be? Nothing. ♪ You winnin'... ♪ But you should go to the doctor, right? Just in case. ♪ Know he wanna wife it 'Cause I want it ♪ - Yeah. - ♪ Maybe I might cuff him ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ - Should I keep going, or...? - Yeah, don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing, but it's best to have it checked. Come on, relax. They haven't found the trophy. He'll never be convicted without evidence. Carla will get him convicted. You don't know what they're like when they're together. One look from her, and Polo will shit his pants. - He'll end up behind bars, trust me. - You don't know that. - He deserves it. - Right. Since you're rich, this will blow your fucking mind, but people don't always get what they deserve, Guzmán. What the hell do you want? I spent Christmas in a juvenile detention center. How about you? Were you skiing in Andorra? Shopping in Milan? Yeah, I had a great fucking time watching my parents' marriage go to shit. Do you think it was easy for me? We could go back to the way it was. - All you need to say is you made it up... - The way it was? I used to live in fear of someone finding out what happened. I don't want to go back to that. - Listen to me... - I'm going to tell the truth, but I'll give you the chance to do it first. If you confess, you'll get a reduced sentence, and we'll put an end to this. What a train wreck, huh? No comment. Sure, because the killer being the classmate of the victim's boyfriend and her brother must be something you see every day, right? Didn't you hear Azucena? I'm focusing on my future. Shit, now I get it. That's why you were shut away in your house all break, ignoring messages, huh? - You were preparing for those interviews. - If you want to talk, Samuel's over there. I'll pass. The missing person can go to hell. I don't let anyone play me, Nadia. - Weren't you crazy about him? - I got over him. - Like the flu. - A tropical flu. Lasted for months. When I see him now, all I can think about is how much the jerk looks like Harry Potter. Maybe he cast a spell on me. And now it's as if someone had gone... And, hey, now when I look at him, I don't feel anything for him. - I wish it were that easy. - Huh? Nothing. Just keep trying. - Carla will listen eventually. - But why? Because she still loves you. Only someone who's madly in love with you would try to hurt you so badly. What did you do to make her so resentful? - Me? Nothing, Mom. I just... - Still, I don't think anything justifies what she's done. I mean... those are very serious accusations. Cayetana, isn't it? Or is that a lie, too? - Begoña! - Look, love is an incurable illness. No pill, therapy, or surgery can get rid of it. I could forgive a person in love for almost anything, but there's no excuse for what you did. - Mom. - It was a scam. You can't afford to be seen with someone like her. No. No. We are together, okay? She's staying the night. - That is, if she wants to. - Yes. Goodbye. Thank you. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you. Can I see your backpack, please? Is this an excuse to flirt with me? Do I look like I'm flirting? Well, it's working. Your backpack. I'm a Muslim, too. I don't steal. Let's check. Sure. How come you didn't ask the woman before me? - Because she wasn't suspicious. - Oh. Just like at the airport, right? At security checkpoints, where they only search people like you. We can search more if you like. Have a nice day, sister. Hello. - Mom, we have to talk. - A letter came. Well... not a letter. Here. ASILAH I have a job, a house... I'm doing fucking great. You'll be even better when you're back with us. - I prefer not to get my hopes up. - He's locked up, Nano. The inspector told your brother that when the bastard confesses, you'll be able to return. Did she really say that? She's that sure? Is this really going to end well? Well, of course, honey. Of course it'll end well. It's not a lost cause. - At the hearing tomorrow... - No, Samuel, no. Those people always land on their feet. They have nine lives, like cats. And if they run out of them, they can buy more. That guy will get what he deserves. Honestly, honey, it's like you were born yesterday. I'm sick of this. Sick of it all. Your brother had the right idea. He's somewhere where nobody knows him, nobody looks down on him. Where he can start over. - What if we go with him? - What? I'm fed up. Everything's an uphill battle here. - I can see that. - What do we have to lose? I have a scholarship at the best school in the country. You've got to be fucking kidding me, Samuel. The same school that's made your life hell from day one? Where they see you as a criminal? Would you really miss anyone there? How are you, sweetheart? "Sweetheart"? I'm no longer a "fucking lying brat," then? Carla, I'd like to take back what happened these past two weeks more than anyone, - but only you can do that. - Get out before Mom sees you. Don't do it for me. Do it for Polo. You said yourself it was an accident. He took a life, but he did it to try to save ours. Does he deserve 30 years in prison for that? How considerate of you, worrying about my ex. And I guess the fact that the police could find out about your shady business dealings has nothing to do with it. I'm worried about your mother. - She's not involved in this. - Not yet. But if you don't retract your statement, if the investigation continues and they find me out, I'll have to give the police bigger fish to fry. If I talk and they look into the winery's financial statements... - Those are your financial statements. - It's her signature on them. ...your mother will lose everything. She'll only have her name, and it'll be worthless. Why don't we both keep quiet? Things could go back to how they were. Carla, I'm asking you to also do whatever it takes to save this family. Nobody is accusing you. We're going to talk to everyone. I heard the glass shatter, and I came running... but I didn't push him. It seems nobody pushed him. According to several witnesses, the glass was cracked, he lost his balance, and... If it was an accident, what are we doing here? He lost his balance because someone stabbed him in the chest. In the hands of that fucking brat again. I say we go to court tomorrow in case she gets any funny ideas. We'll see if that bastard has the balls to lie then. - Can we change the subject? - No, not today. Today, we talk. College recruiters will be coming in two days. Oxford representatives will be there, too. Do you remember? That's where Marina wanted to study. She acted like such a rebel, but she bust her ass to go to one of the most expensive universities in England. We used to make fun of her. That, too, was taken away from her. Who she was, but also who she could have been. That's what I want for the culprit: for him to be left with nothing. It's called justice. It's your word against hers. What if there's someone else? Who? They can't find Christian. Ander. I NEED TO SEE YOU. IT'S REALLY URGENT. When did you notice it? Yesterday. Have you had any of these symptoms lately: fatigue, dizziness... ...bleeding nose or gums? Um, I don't know. Mm-hmm. - What could it be? - Hm, anything or nothing. - Are your parents with you? - No. - I'm 18 years old. - Okay. When the results arrive, we'll send you a message so you can come get them, okay? We should have them by tomorrow. ALL COOL. WILL KNOW SOON, BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK BAD. - ♪ Shake your head, Shaik Omar ♪ - Waiter! ♪ Shake your head, Shaik Omar Once I said that... ♪ Are you talking to me? I need a dose of your finest concoction. Champagne. The usual. What are you celebrating, Mr. Chile? That you're here. So, you don't have a friend in the world, right? Do you think someone with a bottle of champagne can be alone? Any second now, I'll have tons of friends here. Declined. Well, we can fix that. This is worth seven bottles. Your call. You've seen too many movies, kid. ♪ Searching for love in the sky... ♪ I'll say it again. So, you don't have a friend in the world, right? Well, are you going to order a drink or what? I'm more into fucking. ♪ Once I said that ♪ ♪ Hurry, hurry, hurry 'Cause it's getting late ♪ ♪ Say hush, say hush ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, it's getting late ♪ ♪ Once I said that, once I said that ♪ ♪ Hurry, hurry, hurry 'Cause it's getting late ♪ ♪ Say hush, say hush Oh, oh, it's getting late ♪ ♪ C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪ - ♪ C'mon, c'mon ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ C'mon, c'mon, c'mon ♪ ♪ C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon C'mon, c'mon, c'mon ♪ ♪ Hey You kneel to the sign of the cross ♪ ♪ O-ppressed in my hidden stash ♪ ♪ Oh, I lost the last of my left wings ♪ ♪ Got me powerless ♪ ♪ And helpless... ♪ - I guess we should stop. Right, champ? - This has never happened to me before. Sure, and I'm a virgin and a cloistered nun. With all the drugs you take, it's a wonder you can fuck at all. - That's what blue pills are for. - Oh, sure. There's no problem chemistry can't fix, right? Chill. I was just trying to get over one guy by getting under another. But that would have required you to be a bit harder... Yeah. How can I make it up to you? I'd be happy with sleeping in each other's arms, all romantic. Or just you fingering me and getting me off would work. - Do you have a place we could go? - No. I'm sleeping in my car. ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Do you like it? I stole it from a great shop in London. I'm really sorry. I know it feels bad to be judged by the color of your skin - or based on how you dress. - No worries. It was just an excuse to flirt with me, right? Oh, another rich kid. - You all think you're irresistible. - Weren't you apologizing? I'd already finished. - This is your flirting face, then. - I don't have one. - What's your name? - Malick. - I'm Nadia. - I know. Tomorrow, university officials are coming to talk to you. They don't have time for all of you, so please indicate your first choice. They might interview you. We'll come around to collect your forms in just a minute. Polo, stop calling me, for fuck's sake. Why does he want to talk to Ander? He's scared. If Ander talks... He could say Polo confessed and corroborate Carla's story. - Convince Ander to give a statement. - Me? - He's your best friend. - He's a filthy rat. I won't beg for his help. If the hearing doesn't go well, they'll fucking close the case. It'll be fine, Samu. You might've fucked her, but you don't know Carla like I do. Speak with Ander already. Carla! Carla! - How are you? - How am I? Stay away from me! - I swear I'll hit you right here. - Listen. I'm sorry I put you in this position, but you can't back down now. Do you realize if I go ahead with this, I'll lose my family, the wineries, and everything? - What the fuck will I have left? - Me. You'll have me. I love you. Only if I do as you say, right? You'll toss me aside again when you're done. No, if you do what I ask, you'll prove you're the person I fell in love with. Look, there's Sleeping Beauty. - In the car? - Shh! Really? - What? - What the fuck! You said I needed to learn how to budget. Living in the car is much cheaper - than paying for a hotel room. - Sure. That's why you're selling your jewelry. Where's the ring? Not yet, at least. I see you didn't leave out a single detail when you told her, huh? Just the limp dick. Oh, oops! You need help, bonehead. You were with her? You don't waste time, and your taste is getting worse. - No offense. - Hey, that is a bit offensive, sweetheart. Sorry. Do you mind? - Please? - Sure. - Thanks for your help. - No problem. You're going to sell the car, buy a ticket to Chile, and fly back. Let your mom take care of this divine retribution. Bad news. She won't pick up the phone. What happened? Well, I figured Christmas is a busy time. I thought she was just at the beach house. But then I called from a different phone, and she did answer. I said, "Merry Christmas." And she hung up. I see. Come and stay at home. Dad's away for a few days. And then we'll see what we'll do, okay? Hey! Hi. I have something to say. If you have any decency left, you'll tell the judge... I have to go. - I'm talking to you, asshole. - This isn't the time for this. Well, fuck you, then. RESULTS AVAILABLE. PLEASE COME TO THE CLINIC. Hello. Is it almost time? How are you doing? I'm sorry, Mom. Darling... all you did is tell the truth. And sometimes, there's a price to pay for that. We might have lost people along the way... but whatever happens, we'll always have each other. Carla, I'll always be by your side. Always. Hmm? - Ander hates me. - What are you saying, Polo? - What if he talks? - He won't, okay? Maybe not today. But what about tomorrow? Or the day after that? Or next week? Do I really want to live like this? Always wondering if today's the day I'll be caught? Stop it. Do you hear me? Stop it. Don't say that again. Besides, what else can you do, my love? I can tell the truth. Ander Muñoz? You can come in. I'm Julia. Good afternoon. Let's begin. Before the court clerk reads your affidavits, do you confirm your versions of the events? Do you have anything to declare? Uh... I... - Well, I wanted to say... - I made it all up. I'm sorry. I was very angry at my father and my ex. My father was always very strict with me. I made this all up to hurt them. But now I realize I've gone too far... and I deeply regret it. I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused. And I hope you can forgive me. I told you to speak to Ander. Shut the hell up. Didn't you speak with your girlfriend? If she really loved you, she wouldn't have stabbed you in the back. Do you know what you just did? What were you thinking? I was thinking about my future. Let's go home, honey. We'll talk later, okay? I didn't speak to him at all last night. We hadn't spoken in a long time. What did you do just after he fell? I went down to the dance floor. That's all. Were you serious about leaving? The sooner the better. Hm? You heard, right? What are we going to do? What do you mean? We're going to forget about it. They let him go free. It's over. - And let him get away with it? - It's not our business, Omar. What do you mean? Of course it's our business. It's your business. - Polo confessed to you. - Omar. I have enough problems to deal with. I don't need to take on anyone else's. What's wrong? Did you hear from the doctor? Ander... Yeah, he said it's nothing. It was just a scare. You just gave me a scare, you dick. Can we just lie on the sofa and not talk, please? Okay. Want to play video games? - Is it good? - Mm. Delicious. - Mm. - I'm glad you're home. Thanks. Dad will be back in three days. We've got time to plan what to do. Okay? He won't listen to me. He'd listen to you if you told the truth. I-I can't do that, Valerio. - Hm? - Even if I wanted to. I can't. I just can't. You said he'd be back in three days. What's this scumbag doing here? Holy shit. You idiot. - What's he... Answer me! - Dad, chill! Can we talk about this in a civilized manner, like... Norwegians? I appreciate you had the courtesy to sit at opposite ends of the table. I only told him to come because his mom won't talk to him. I don't care. He has to stop taking advantage of my daughter. I'm your son, too. You are the degenerate who took advantage of a minor. I didn't want to get the police involved, but enough is enough. - Dad. - What you did is a crime, and you'll pay. First, with a restraining order. And then, maybe, even with jail time. Please. I'm being very civilized and very Norwegian, Lucrecia. Anyone else would have killed him for molesting his daughter. Valerio didn't molest me. Okay? - You're just a child. - And so is he. He's got you under his spell. You don't know what you're saying. I know perfectly well what I'm saying, Dad. Nobody forced me to do anything. Ever. I fucked Valerio because I needed him. I wanted him more than anything in the world. Love is not a crime. And he's not a criminal. And I'm not the perfect daughter... ...and the innocent child you think I am. So you're an adult now. You didn't want to see it, and I didn't want you to see it either. But I am. Very well. From now on, you'll live like an adult. Until you turn 18, I'm legally obligated to provide you with food and shelter, but that's it. Forget about money, luxuries, outfits, and expensive universities. - What are you saying? - You're an adult. And when you turn 18, I want you out of this house. You are already 19, so I don't need to spell it out for you. Out. Hi. How are you? - I don't know what I'm doing here. - Right. Why didn't you answer my messages yesterday? Is that seriously what you're worried about? Cayetana, we need to get rid of the trophy, and all this will be over. It's safe with me. - Okay? - What? - Listen to me. - No, no, no, Cayetana. No. - Polo. - No. It's too risky to try to get rid of it now. - And it's safe with me. - What do you mean? Polo. Hey, Polo. Look at me. Look at me. Listen. Don't worry, I'm on your side. I'm the only one on your side. Okay? It's excellent. Your résumé is impressive, Nadia. Thank you very much. But... - ...I'll be honest with you. - Mm-hmm? I don't think we'll grant you the scholarship. Why not? At our university, we not only look at grades and hard work... but also the student's life outside of the classroom. Hm, well, I have all sorts of interests. Uh, I'm very curious. I work at my parents' shop, and I'd like to give them a better life. I'm sure of that. But we've heard of a video going around. That's not working in your favor. We look for model students for our scholarships. I'm sorry. How did it go? - Uh, would you rather tell me over coffee? - What? I'm a good Muslim. - I'll introduce myself to your parents. - I'm the one who's not a good Muslim. Are you the only one who hasn't heard? "The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin." Muhammad said that. I wouldn't go against him. - Do you know about the video? - I've heard about it. And you still want to get me coffee? What kind of Muslim are you? One who lives in this century. And I didn't say anything about treating you to a coffee. - If the girl wants to pay, it's okay. - Sure, but I thought you were loaded. My father is loaded. He's the richest man in Senegal. But here, I must be the... third or fourth richest? - Second, if I'm really lucky. - Where have you been all this time? What kind of university would you like to attend? Sorry, but with all due respect, I couldn't give two shits about this. It's not the right time for this. I won't finish the school year here. In fact, I plan on dropping out today. Look, sir. I just want to live well. But without cheating. All legit, you know? And with my shitty grades... Well, you tell me, mister. Look, the cousin of a very dear friend, the best student in the class, by the way, is very interested in finding out about the whole scholarship thing, in case she could not afford to pay for her studies for some reason. I have no problem paying for college... ...but just in case... So, I want to go to the London College of Fashion, but I also want to be with my boyfriend, and he doesn't know what to do yet. Whatever he decides, we'll do it together or in the same city. He can't live without me. So, Ander, where do you see yourself in five years? In ten years? What do you want to do with your future? Sorry. ♪ You show ♪ ♪ And ♪ ♪ When it shows ♪ ♪ It shows ♪ ♪ In the mirrors you see ♪ ♪ In dreams that can't be ♪ ♪ Wide ♪ ♪ Awake ♪ ♪ It shows ♪ ♪ In a stranger ♪ Hey! That's enough! Do you hear? I won't tolerate any more of this. Do you know how embarrassing this is for the school? From now on, the slightest misconduct or lack of discipline... will mean immediate expulsion. No excuses, no exceptions. - That means you won't graduate. - That's unfair. Very well. Let's talk about fairness and justice. The judge dropped the charges against your classmate. He is a murderer. The person who accused him retracted her statement. The school has already disciplined her. And she may well face legal consequences. So to make things very clear: if anyone so much as touches a hair on his head again, I will personally make sure they don't finish out the year... and that it goes on their permanent record. Understood? I can't leave. So, we have to leave as if we've done something wrong, and Nano will have to spend the rest of his life in hiding? No. I won't let them get away with it. - We need to find a way... - To do what? What are you going to do? - ♪ Your eyes ♪ - Fine. - ♪ Your smile... ♪ - I'll stay with you. - I won't leave you here alone. - No. Nano needs you more than I do. And you need to get out of here. I promise the two of you will be able to return soon. ♪ For a while now ♪ ♪ Pull you close ♪ And who will take care of you? Mom... who takes care of whom in this house? ♪ Walk with me ♪ - ♪ We'll head that way ♪ - I don't know what to say. - ♪ Let yourself fall... ♪ - Don't worry about it. It's water under the bridge. All is forgiven. ♪ Now you're a home ♪ I just want us to put all this behind us... and to start looking forward. We haven't found the murder weapon, so we're searching everybody. Can I check your bag? I never would have hurt him. Not him. I loved him.
