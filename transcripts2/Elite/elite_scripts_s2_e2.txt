 And your brother got her pregnant? The one that's in prison? But he didn't kill her. The key is around Carla. Carla's that little marchioness, right? The one with nice, tight tits. Yes. And there was I thinking I'd be bored at this school. [laughs] Your left. Your right. Your left. Your left.

 Harder, for fuck's sake. If I only could get close to her. How are you planning to do that? Come here. You don't seem to have a lot in common. Nor does she mix with people of your class. She mixed with Christian. To fuck, right? You think there's a chance she could like you? - I'm a scholarship kid like he was. - Sure... Son of a bitch. He wants to get in her pants, in order to get in her mind. I'm sticking my finger up at you, but you can't see it. Whatever! So, how are you going to do it? I don't know. I'll think of something.

 That's a great plan. Anyway, Samu, if you think Christian ended up without legs by being close to her, shouldn't you be careful? Huh? [women speaking Chinese] [inspector] Have you noticed anything missing? His phone? His wallet? Clothes? 34 HOURS MISSING It is important that you tell us any details. His phone and wallet are not here. And his clothes... I don't know. All of his jeans were similar. I don't know if any are missing... I have no clue. Tell me you will find him. This can't be happening. We will do everything we can. But that's why we need your cooperation. Did you notice your son acting strange lately? Or was he doing anything out of the ordinary? Well... I don't know. To be honest with you... I don't know. I was working double shifts for my other son's bail money... I barely saw Samuel. [inspector] And what can you say about this? Why does your son have all this money? Pilar? Every hour counts when a person goes missing. Every hour that passes takes us further away from the possibility of finding him. Help us. [pop music playing] [Lu] Girl, she has 39,000 followers. I'm sure she paid them. [Carla over phone] What are you talking about, Lu? My God, Carla, what are you on? I'm talking about the new girl. Don't you go on Instagram? She made sure everyone knows she starts at school today with all the hashtag, Las Encinas. [Carla] I'm gonna go. I'm not in the mood for this nonsense. - Why did you startle me? - Let me see. - You want to see her? Really? - Show me! - So you're that interested, huh? - Are you afraid of the competition? - I want to see her! - Now you want to follow her? Am I still making you nervous? [Nadia] Dad. How are you? I don't need this. Shh. You can't walk yet. We're going to follow the doctor's orders. I'm fine. And now that you'll be home, it's even better. You'll get better quickly, you'll see. We will all help you, won't we? [Iman] Sure. [Yusef] Class... Go to class. [Nadia] It doesn't matter if I'm late. You are more important. Let's see how we'll manage everything here. [Yusef] Your brother... He will take care of it. You get to class. - Dad, I just want to help... - No! [Iman] Calm down. Guzmán... Why have you brought Marina's things here? Is this what you meant by getting rid of them? I'll do it. Give me some time. [sighs] Okay. Don't forget that the mass is at 7:00 p.m. today. Have you told your friends? I'll do it in class. Darling, it's important for us all. It will help us remember her, but... also to start putting all this behind us. "All this"? By "all this," do you mean the fact that my sister got murdered, Mom? How can you be so cold? Darling, I am dead inside. I breathe and I eat, but I'm dead. I will never get over it. But you will. You have to. You have to find a way to get over it. Is something wrong? Dad... Why did you decide to pay for Christian to go the clinic? It was very generous. I thought he was important to you. - That's why I did it. - [scoffs] I wasn't born yesterday. Why else would I do it? Huh? I'll get out here. [cell phone chimes] She just followed me. Does she think I'm gonna follow back? Who does she think she is? She's already taken seven selfies since she got to school. Outrageous! You know what? She reminds me of your crippled Christian Grey. - Really, Lu? - Yeah. You could show a bit of fucking empathy. Okay, it's too soon to joke about the damn cripple. Got it. His name is Christian, okay? - Mmm-hmm. - Christian! - Christian! - [cell phone chimes] - Did she follow you as well? - No. It's from Guzmán's mother. To let me know that Marina's mass is today. She doesn't seem so retarded. There's nothing more attractive than a woman reading. She's not reading, she's posing. Say whatever you want, but she just threw you off course. And suddenly, you're a bit intrigued. She's all yours. Now you have a new target. [in English] Go. - [in Spanish] Hi. Good morning. - Hi. I'll sit next to you on one condition. Don't tell me how it ends. I'm only halfway through it. You're reading The Second Sex? - Well, actually, I prefer doing it. - [laughs] And if it's with a feminist, it's a whole new level. Sure. Double points, right? Well, nice to meet you. [chuckles] - Hey. - [Lu] Hi, my love. How are you? Fine. Hey, you didn't tell me about the mass. How do you know about it? Your mother sent us all a message. [Guzmán] Fucking hell... I hope she hasn't sent it to everyone. Hey. Listen, the thing is, I don't know who to ask, and since you're one of his friends... Do you think Guzmán would mind if I came along? You're going, aren't you? [scoffs] You really talked her around. [inspector] You are the ones that spend the most time with Samuel. 36 HOURS MISSING His classmates. His friends. I am sure that one of you must know what happened to him. And my job is to find out. Samuel, can I ask you something? How is Omar's father doing? This morning, I went to ask Omar but he wouldn't even let me into the store. I really fucked up at the hospital with his family. [sighs] I'm a textbook dickhead, man. What can I do to get him to forgive me? Give him time. [Guzmán] Ander! What were you doing talking to him? - Didn't I make myself clear the other day? - Not now, Guzmán. I'm not in the mood for your obsessive rants and ridiculous dramas. "Ridiculous dramas"? That's fucking great. Guzmán... I'm sorry about your sister. But enough is enough. Enough about masses, and obsessing over the same thing. I'm not betraying you or your sister's memory by talking to Samuel. We all have our own lives and our own problems. First of all, the mass was my mother's idea, okay? If your life and your problems mean it's too much trouble for you, then don't go. I don't fucking feel like it at all. Are you going? I don't know, Polo, I don't know. I wish this would end once and for all. I haven't slept a wink in three nights. Why? Why? Do you really think Christian's accident was just a coincidence? I don't understand how you can be so relaxed. You're the one who told me not to lose my cool ever. Well, I think I'm starting to become delirious. I need to talk to someone before I go crazy. Shall we go for a drink later? Now that Christian's not around, you want to go for a drink with me. Forget it. It doesn't matter. So, now, I press the number of the product I want, right? Great. You won't believe it, but this is the first time I've used one of these. Are you serious? Didn't they have one at your other school? I haven't set foot in a school in four years. I'm thrilled to be back in one. It's so... school-y, you know what I mean? You haven't studied in four years? - You're repeating a year. - No, I studied from home. Homeschooled. With private teachers and all that stuff. It's the worst thing about never staying in one place. I'm so happy to be back. I really missed all this. Not this one. Forty-five, right? [Lu in English] Really? [in Spanish] Those chips? If you're going to eat that many calories, at least get something worthwhile. - Well, she's right. - [in English] Forty-three. [in Spanish] Hmm. Thank you so much, girls. And thank you, you've been lovely. Bye. - Have you seen the photos of her house? - What? They're so cool. And she lives alone, no parents. Alone? I don't believe it. - Everything okay? - Yes. Not really. I don't want to go to that mass. I don't want to go. You have your reasons, right? No ceremony is going to bring back my sister. Nor will it make anything less painful. - Don't go, then. Easy peasy. - It's easier said than done. I can't let my parents down. Aren’t you tired of being you? Always doing the right thing. No? Now I see why my parents think you're perfect for my sister. But you know what? I'm starting to doubt whether someone who's so messed up is right for Lu. If only I could stop obsessing over things for a while... And stop feeling this rage that consumes me. I can help you with that. You know I can. Darling, do you fancy a coffee at my place later? I know how it is to be the new kid. How hard it is to make friends... You're so nice! - I know. - Lucrecia? - Right. - Cayetana. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you. Can you send me the address? - Sure. - Great. - I'll see you at 5:00. - Great. - Bye. - Bye. Ah, shoot. I can't. I forgot my father has some event at home this afternoon. It's okay. - I could come over to yours. - To my place? - Yes. - Okay. Great! Can you send me the address? You're such a sweetheart! [in English] You bitch! [in Spanish] Did you just try to dodge me, Carla? Uh... Yes. Are you still annoyed about what I said about Christian? If you had told me that he was really important to you, I would never have joked about him. But since you never tell me anything anymore... What do you want me to tell you? Everything is a joke to you. You prefer to focus on your new friend's Instagram rather than your friend herself. Then you say that she's superficial or her life is over the top. You're the same. All front. That's why you're obsessed with her. Oh, I'm superficial, am I? Bullshit! I spent three fucking weeks with Guzmán, stuck in his grandparents' village, trying to keep him afloat. And even then, I didn't stop calling or texting you, asking how you were... You were missing. But you're the one that is increasingly distant and tight-lipped. So don't give me any of this shit. What's going on with you? It's me. You can talk to me. I wouldn't know where to start. I'm sorry. [inaudible] - Hi, Omar. - Hey! Take anything you need to study. How is Dad? We struggled to get him into bed. He was adamant about working. And he can't. [sighs] This is going to be fucking difficult. I've been thinking about how to organize things. You could stay in the morning and as soon as I get home from school, I'll take over until close. [Omar] No way. Dad wants you to study and me to take care of the store. So drop it already. So what about you? You won't go back to school? I suppose it doesn't matter if I skip a year. Anyway, you're the brainy one. You don't have to sacrifice everything on your own. Can you convince Dad? Then, that's that. [Cayetana] Lu, welcome. Hey. - How are you? - Good. You? Your house looks beautiful. Yeah... Shall I give you a quick tour? Or would that be distasteful? Oh, dear... I brought some pink champagne. Yay for bad taste! - Yay! Come on... - [dog barking] That's the kitchen, Imelda's territory. I couldn't live without her. Look at what she made for us... I told her I'm on a diet, but she won't listen. The living room, and there's a small garden and a swimming pool. Well, two swimming pools. The other pool is too small. Then the five bedrooms. Mine with a huge dressing room. It's the first thing I fell in love with in this house. Shall I put the bottle to chill? Do you really live here alone? With Imelda. But I gave her the afternoon off so that we could be more comfortable. Oh, you're so sweet. I love it! [doorbell ringing] Are you expecting someone? Hey there! [Lu] What are you doing here? No party without us! There is no party here, Valerio. We were just going to have a snack. A snack... A party... They are both the same thing. - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Hi. Seriously? - What's in there? - The best part... is inside. FOLLOW Shit! No, no! YOU HAVE UNFOLLOWED MARQUESITAPON I'm such an ass! Listen, I don't think it's the best time for you to be here. Also, I was thinking of going to Marina's mass. What was she like? None of you talk about it, and her ghost hasn't turned up at my place yet. She was a whirlwind. She destroyed everything in her path. But I have a feeling that despite dying so young, she lived more in 16 years than many people do in 100. [Rebeca] So she was my kind of girl, then. And I'd say that if she had the choice, she wouldn't even go to her own mass. So, skip the drama. Let's get dolled up and bust some moves. No. Haven't you seen how things are here? I'm not in the mood to party. I'm not talking about abandoning your family. Girl, don't be so dramatic. I'm talking about going out for a walk, having a bit of a dance... You don't say "make the best of a bad situation" in Morocco or what? I'm from Palestine. [laughs] You really don't know me. Sorry, but let me remind you I've seen you dancing like... Moving like... [whistles] What was that move again? Come on, woman, I'll bring you back in two hours. I swear! [exclaims] Guzmán, I'm fed up with your shit! Are you crazy or what? I'm sorry. They're trashing your house. I swear, I’ll kick them out. That's all right! This is my third Negroni, I'm already numb. I don't feel or suffer anything so... [Lu] Cheers, baby. [Guzmán in English] Cheers! - Oh! - [Lu in Spanish] Seriously, Valerio? Whoever guesses what I'm wearing under this robe gets €100. Please, Valerio! Which, by the way, fits me... How do I look? It fits you perfectly. That color suits you right! - Me! - You! Nothing, you're naked. No. You. Underwear! No. Lu? It's your turn. I know, but I'm not playing. - Can we please leave now? - No. - No. - [Cayetana] I know what it is. - I know what it is. - [Valerio] Tell me. You're only wearing a sock. - All yours, young lady. - [Guzmán] She guessed it! Smart girl. - I like this girl. I like this girl! - Me, too! - Hey, where's my prize? - Mmm-hmm. Slower, slower! Slower so you can enjoy it better. [Lu] Careful, he bites. Now... [Valerio and Guzmán exclaiming] Valerio, are you serious? Put it back on! You're embarrassing! I'm covering myself. [Lu] You're ridiculous. [Guzmán] You're great, you bastard. [Lu exclaiming] Please, don't. - Please, don't! Guzmán! - [Guzmán exclaiming] Seriously? Please! [Cayetana] I'm crazy, too. Guzmán, for fuck's sake! We have to go to the church. And now you're soaked. [Valerio screaming and laughing] - Lu, come on! - [Lu] I hate you! - Hey. - Hi. [Polo] Have you spoken to Guzmán? Uh... before coming? No. Why? He's not answering his phone. Keep trying. He won't pick up for me. [indistinct chatter] - [Ander] So? - [Polo] No answer. Should I try Lu? Guzmán? - [line ringing] - So? No answer. I have an idea. [Valerio exclaiming on video] [Guzmán] Cayetana! Turn the volume down! [Guzmán] This message is for you! Welcome! [Ander] Sorry. [inaudible] Is that now? What's up with the guy? [people murmuring] Don't! Not here, please. - We better go get him. - Why? He's having fun. Can't you see he's not right? Let's go get him. Please, let's all gather around. You shouldn't be here. And what about you? You weren't exactly very friendly with Marina. How would you know? Marina told me everything. Did she? Did she also tell you that your brother got her pregnant? Marina did what she liked to us. And here we are, mourning her. [inspector] Do you know what could have happened to make him disappear off the radar? He would never leave without saying anything. It's fucking awesome. The guys, the waiter, the music... - I've told my friend Mari... - [Nadia] Who's Mari? Hey. Where are you going? We are going to Guzmán's... family's mass. - In memory of Marina... - [Omar] Sure. You're all dressed up like this to go to mass? Dude, for a queer, you have that whole hetero-castrating-father thing nailed. You told her that I'm gay? And that she's a virgin, too. I don't know why everyone opens up to me. And between you and me, hers really is a crime. You aren't going to a mass. No. Nadia... Just because I'm the man of the house now doesn't mean you need to lie to me. I'm not Dad. Are you doing inventory? [Omar] Yes. And it's overwhelming. Omar... I'll stay and help you, then. Dad doesn't need to know. Rebe, I'm sorry, you'd better go. No way. No worries. I'll help you and we'll get it done faster, right? How do we do it? We count the oranges, the pears... What a great plan! Who wants to go dancing when you can spend the night counting. [laughing] They put her ashes there, right? No matter how rich you are, you can't just bury someone wherever you want. Seriously? This is stalking now. What do you want from me? Say it once and for all. 2002-2018. Nobody's life should be so short. Those two dates stuck with me, too. I can't get rid of the feeling I get right here. What? I've never seen you like this. You don't know me at all. I need a beer. What about you? Me, too. But not with you. Do you have a better option? - [inaudible] - [dance music playing over speakers] These two are crazy. I bet you never get bored of them. Especially you, you're a troublemaker. Why? I didn't manage to convince you. I never snort anything, not even if you got naked for me. Are you sure? [Cayetana] Dude... Come here! Lucrecia, stop eating and come dance. What? - Stop eating and come dance! - [Lu] I don't want to dance! - Enough, Guzmán! - [Guzmán] Fucking hell! If I kiss you, it's wrong. If I don't, it's wrong, too. - [Guzmán] Cayetana! - What? - Is there any champagne left? - Yeah! Come on, let's get some more champagne. [Cayetana laughing] [Guzmán] Whoo! [Valerio] What's wrong? Are you happy now? You've managed to snare the new girl. Check. You'll be able to mess around all you like, with no parents around to control you. Go for it! Doesn't sound like a bad idea, does it? Great! But you know what? I can't get someone else out of my head. - And she won't let me be. - [laughs] What? I haven't been able to get her out of my head for years. You know what? It hurts. It hurts so much, I don't know why I came back. Luckily... Luckily for you, I've got this. Are you blaming me for your drug addiction, you idiot? No. I'm only saying that no one can outshine you. - [cell phone chimes] - Let's see... They're here! Reinforcements are here! Where are my dudes? Hey, guys, how are you doing? - What's up? Come up here! - Whoo! - [Lu] What are you doing here? - [Guzmán exclaiming] Welcome! My dudes! What's up? My boys! You came! [inspector] Do you think one of your classmates could have something to do with Samuel's disappearance? What makes you think I'd know something about that? [inspector] The fact that, since you sat down, you haven't looked me in the eye even once. For example. Have you spoken to my sister yet? Lucrecia? Call me Lu. Why? Because you should. Show me a picture of your boyfriend. This is him. - Oh, shit, he's in our class. - [Omar chuckles] Yeah. Shit! I had my eye on that one. But you've already taken him. - [chuckles] - Good for you, but... shit. Don't be stupid and call him. [clicks tongue] Nah... [sighs] I have bigger problems now. What problems? Haven't you noticed? Well, dude... Don't hide behind this to avoid fixing what's in here. And don't take too long. You never know when people might disappear from your life. Call him. [Omar] Nah... [dance music playing over speakers] - How much has he had to drink? - [Lu] I don't know, Ander. All of it. All he has left is the water from the swimming pool. Let's see if you manage to take him away from here. Take me away? No, no! Who's staying? Are you staying? Come on! Who's staying? Me! - You're staying here? Yeah! - There we go! Yeah! [Guzmán] Fuck! - Fucking hell! Sorry! - Shit! - I'm sorry! Was it very expensive? - [Cayetana] No. I think my mother bought it at a Sotheby's auction, but it's one of many. Yes. She won't miss it. [Lu] I think we've had enough, right? This was the last straw. We'd better leave. - Please! - What a pain in the ass! No chance, Lu. I'm staying, right, Caye? - [Ander] Yeah, let's go. - The party ain't over! No, let's go, Guzmán. You should sleep this off already. I'm fine! I'm fine! Why don't you stop treating me like an idiot? I'm fine! Or don't you think so? Because everything is perfect and wonderful. And we've all turned the page, right? Nobody is saying that. Fuck, turn that off. [music stops] We're not in the same boat as you and none of us have lost our sister. Whatever! Do you know what? My sister didn't die. Hmm? She was killed! My sister was killed! All right? You don't seem to get that into your skull. [gagging] Please, Ander, take him away. [Guzmán groaning] [Ander] Come on. Let's go. - [Guzmán] I'm fine. - Let's go. [Guzmán] No! Cayetana, this is so embarrassing... Sorry for all of this. - ["Armenia" playing] - Another. We've already paid for it. Two hundred bucks for a bottle. That's immoral. No, it's expensive. That's all.

Well, maybe you're right, huh? I may be bi. - Ander. - What? Were you ever hot for Guzmán? What are you saying? - Were you? - Me? Never. Yuck. What about me? - [scoffs] - [Polo] Were you hot for me? A little bit for sure. Just check out this hot body. You wish! Scoot. Shit. I've been sleeping alone for some time. The warmth is appreciated. The touching... Easy with the touching. Why? Are you nervous? Hmm? Or horny? Because I'm getting... I'm getting hard as hell. You're fucking kidding me. Look. Cover yourself, you bastard. You cover yourself, too! Shit! What do you want me to do? I'm not made of stone. - Wanna jerk off? - [chuckles] With Guzmán here? You're crazy. We are crazy. I know. We are crazy. This is too creepy, isn't it? Yes. Let's leave it. Tsk. No. But on one condition. Tomorrow we forget all about it, okay? Yes. We're just friends jerking off. Right. LU HAS STARTED FOLLOWING YOU [door opens] - Hi, darling. - [Cayetana] Hi. Good evening. Caye, you're still here? Yes, but I'm done, so... Where's the dog? I had to shut him in the pantry. He was very badly behaved. He broke a porcelain figure that was over there. Ah. Darling, why don't you make me a couple of Negronis? To see if they calm me down a bit. Caye. Don't punish the dog again, okay? Stick to cleaning. - [dog whining] - Okay. If you don't need anything else, I'll be leaving now. - [woman] Bye, darling. - Bye. [woman] Negronis. Nadia, you're late for class. Go. Yes, darling, go to class. [Omar] Mom and I will take care of things. No. Dad, I can be late for school for once. And you know what? It doesn't matter. They will understand. And if they don't, that's their problem. - No... - Yes. It's okay for Omar to take charge of the store, but we are here, too. And no matter how much you dislike that, things have changed. You will have to accept it. Don't be too long. We'll drop you all off at school. [cell phone ringing] [Ander] Good morning. You guys seriously snore, man. Do you know why it pisses me off so much when you guys talk to Samuel? You act as if nothing happened. Because of his brother. No. That's what I thought. That I was pissed off because his brother murdered my sister. Him being around pisses me off for another reason. It goes round and round in my head like Jiminy Cricket. I could have stopped them. He warned me and I did nothing. Dude... There's something that concerns me even more. What if he was right? What if... Nano is not the real killer? How can I move on, not knowing if the one who did it is on the loose? Maybe he simply decided to leave. Why would he do that? Because Samuel should never have come back to this school. Ever. Do you know if Samuel could have gotten money illegally? Why the fuck are you asking me that? Why don't you talk to the marchioness? Carla? Why? I don't know. All the guys around her end up vanishing one way or another. [Carla] I don't know anything. I'm sorry. Okay, thank you. [breathing heavily] [Lu] What's going on? Nothing. I know you, Carla. Or are you going to keep this to yourself, too? Samuel is not missing. He's dead. [suspenseful music playing]
