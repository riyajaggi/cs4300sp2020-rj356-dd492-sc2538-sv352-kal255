YOU GUYS ARE A LOT FUNNIER SINCE YOUR LOBOTOMIES. OOH. WHAT A FAMILY. THE GUY DATES HIS DAD, THEN GETS HIS LITTLE SISTER TO STICK UP FOR HIM. YOU KNOW, THIS COULD MAKE THE NEWS, TOO. WHAT A GUY. WE'RE BUDDIES. YEOW! I LOVE THIS GUY! YEOW! COME ON, BEN. I NEED YOUR HELP. THE MICE NEED YOUR HELP. I'M JUST NOT POLITICAL. BEN, THERE COMES A TIME WHEN PRINCIPLE ALONE COMPELS US TO TAKE A STAND.

I WONDER WHERE MIKE IS. YOU CHECK THE LIBRARIES. I'LL CHECK THE MUSEUMS. WHY IS HE MAKING SUCH A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF THIS? YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T SPEAK TO ME LAST NIGHT. HE GAVE ME THE COLD SHOULDER THIS MORNING. NOW HE'S 2 HOURS LATE. JASON, JASON, JASON. MMM. I FIND THAT AT TIMES LIKE THESE, IT'S GOOD TO KEEP A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS. OH, HONEY, I'M SURE HE'S OVER IT BY NOW. ON THE OTHER HAND, I'M NO PSYCHIATRIST. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO TUCK IN THE MICE. YOU DID GET YOUR MOTHER'S NOSE. OK, SORRY, DUMB JOKE. NO, NO. YOU'RE A LAUGH RIOT, DAD. HEY, MIKE, I AM SORRY, OK? I KNOW YOU FEEL I EMBARRASSED YOU, AND I'M SORRY. YEAH, SURE. GREAT, DAD. MIKE, I'M APOLOGIZING. DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN? WHAT, YOU MEAN LIKE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION? YOU KNOW, I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THOSE TICKETS, AND THAT WAS SO YOU COULD GO TO THE CONCERT. I THINK YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE SELF-ABSORBED ABOUT... I'M BEING SELF-ABSORBED? DAD, YOU GAVE ME NOOGIES ON THE EVENING NEWS. WELL, SOME PEOPLE'S PARENTS LOCK THEM IN A CLOSET FOR 7 YEARS. YOU GOT IT REAL ROUGH. YOUR FATHER LIKES YOU. YUCK, GROSS, COOTIES! I WAS SHOWING MY FEELINGS FOR YOU, MIKE. WELL, YOU GOT FEELINGS FOR MOM, TOO, BUT YOU DON'T GO SHOWING THEM IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE TRI-STATE AREA. DAD, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, THE GUYS AT SCHOOL... OH, COME ON, MIKE, WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT THOSE GUYS SAY? DAD, IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU DON'T... YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. I MEAN, THEY LAUGHED AT ME BECAUSE I WENT WITH YOU. BUT I DEFENDED YOU. I SAID, "MY DAD'S A COOL GUY." AND THEN WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU SLOBBER ALL OVER ME ON NEWSLINE NEW YORK. ALL RIGHT. OK, MIKE, I AM SORRY. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO THE CONCERT TOGETHER. HEY, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. NO. I MEAN, MAYBE YOU JUST SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A GIRL. DAD, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME. LOOK, I'M TAKIN' A BIG RISK BY TELLING YOU THIS, BUT, I ACTUALLY LIKE DOING STUFF WITH YOU. I DO. I MEAN, I WAS SITTING THERE WATCHING SPRINGSTEEN WITH MY DAD, AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PARENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A SPRINGSTEEN IS. AND ALL THROUGH THE CONCERT I WAS THINKING, "HEY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY GREAT." YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING. WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN BOTH THINK THAT WITHOUT LETTING THE ENTIRE FREE WORLD IN ON IT. WELL, I GUESS I DID LOSE CONTROL A LITTLE. OK, A LOT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DAD. I GUESS BRUCE HAS THAT EFFECT ON PEOPLE. I GUESS MAYBE NEXT TIME WE SHOULD SEE SOMEONE A LITTLE LESS DYNAMIC. WELL, I HEAR THE OSMONDS ARE COMING TO TOWN. NAH. YEAH! I LOVE THIS GUY. YEOW! ♪ YOU GUYS, I'M TELLING YOU, THIS DOES NOT COMPARE WITH SEEING HIM LIVE. MIKE! MIKE! YOUR MOTHER AND I ARE IN THE NEXT ROOM! WE'RE TRYING TO READ! YOU GUYS THINK YOU COULD TURN DOWN THAT, UH... TURN DOWN WHOEVER THAT IS.
