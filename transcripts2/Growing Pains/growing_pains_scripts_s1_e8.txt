REMEMBER WHEN YOU JUST HAD TO TAKE HORSEBACK-RIDING LESSONS? YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU SAID IT WOULD HELP YOU OVERCOME YOUR FEAR OF LARGE ANIMALS? YEAH, WELL, YOU GOTTA ADMIT, DEBBIE DIZOMBA WAS LARGE. RIGHT. AND REMEMBER WHEN YOU JUST HAD TO LEARN SCOTTISH FOLK DANCING? HEY, I WAS STARVED FOR CULTURE. OH. THIS IS DIFFERENT, DAD. THIS IS KARATE. IT'S A MAN'S SPORT. AND IT COSTS NEXT TO NOTHING. OH, GOOD, GOOD. YOU GOT CHANGE FOR $1? OK, HOW NEXT TO NOTHING? IT'S ONLY A $125, DAD. OH. AND THAT INCLUDES A DOZEN TRAINING BRICKS. MIKE, HERE'S $10. GO BUY HER A BURGER. IT'S CHEAPER.

OK, IT'S A MARRIAGE-COMPATIBILITY TEST THAT I'M PLANNING TO GIVE A COUPLE OF MY PATIENTS. OH, HOW FUN! LET'S TAKE IT AND SEE HOW WE DO. I KNEW WE WOULD SAY THAT. OH, DON'T BE SUCH A STICK-IN-THE-MUD.

UH-HUH. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN ABOUT THESE KARATE LESSONS, DAD, BECAUSE IT FORCED ME TO LOOK DEEPER INTO MYSELF AND ASK, "MIKE, WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THESE LESSONS?" UH-HUH. AND THE ANSWER CAME TO ME, DAD. "MIKE, YOU WANT TO TAKE KARATE, BECAUSE IT DEVELOPS DISCIPLINE." OH. NOT ONLY PHYSICAL DISCIPLINE, DAD, BUT SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE AS WELL. THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, IS IT? OH, YEAH, DAD. I MEAN, HEY, WITH NO DISCIPLINE, EACH ONE OF US "IS LIKE A RUDDERLESS CRAFT IN A SEA OF CONFLICTING DESIRES." AND YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD? I NEED THE RUDDER THAT KARATE WILL GIVE ME. I SEE. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU'RE TAKING KARATE TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE THIS SPIRITUAL STATE OF, UH, DON HO? RIGHT. DON HO.

AGREED ON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. ESPECIALLY THE SMUTTY QUESTIONS. OH, HERE'S ONE WE DISAGREED ON. "WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE HOBBY?" OH, JASON. WHAT? I SAID "GARDENING," AND YOU SAID "COLLECTING BASEBALL CARDS." HOW CAN WE GO ON WITH THIS RIFT IN OUR MARRIAGE? IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. WE'LL HAVE TO SELL THE HOUSE AND DIVIDE THE KIDS. YOU TAKE MIKE. UH-OH, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE YOU SCREWED UP. "WHAT SIDE OF THE BED DO YOU SLEEP ON?" I SAID "THE LEFT" AND YOU SAID "THE LEFT." WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU TAKE UP MOST OF THE BED, AND I SLEEP ON WHAT'S LEFT. OH, NO, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE YOU BOTCHED UP. JASON, YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL. "WOULD YOU EVER KEEP ANYTHING FROM YOUR SPOUSE?" WHAT DID I SAY? YOU SAID "YES." WELL, THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'D KEEP THINGS FROM ME? THAT'S LIKE SAYING THAT YOU'D LIE TO ME. NO, NO, YOU'RE TWISTING MY ANSWER. THE QUESTION SIMPLY ASKS, "WOULD YOU EVER KEEP ANYTHING FROM YOUR SPOUSE?" "ANYTHING" IS A BIG WORD. IT MEANS ANYTHING. WELL, THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP. NOW WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT "LIAR" MEANS? OH, COME ON, MAGGIE, WHAT ARE YOU MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL OF THIS FOR? I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST WITH YOU. OH? YES. REMEMBER WHEN SOMEBODY TRIED TO MIX CEMENT IN YOUR BLENDER? I STEPPED FORWARD RIGHT AWAY AND SAID, "BEN DID IT." JASON, YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY, DON'T YOU? NO, HONEY, I'M JUST SAYING... WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER THE MATTAPOISETT INN. THE MATTA... YES, WHERE WE HAD OUR HONEYMOON. YES, NOW REMEMBER THAT FIRST NIGHT, AND REMEMBER IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE WHEN WE SAT... HONEY, I REMEMBER WHAT WE DID IN FRONT OF THAT FIREPLACE. REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID? YES, I SAID, "LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN, WITHOUT THE ICE CUBES." YOU ALSO SAID THAT TOTAL HONESTY IS ESSENTIAL TO A HAPPY MARRIAGE. I SAID THAT AFTER WE WERE MARRIED? OK, OK. I SAID THAT. MMM-HMM. BUT WE'RE MORE MATURE NOW. SO, NOW WE LIE LIKE RUGS. NO, I'M ONLY SAYING THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I MIGHT NOT VOLUNTEER. WELL, LIKE WHAT THINGS? GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE. AN EXAMPLE? UH-HUH. 2 TRAINS, TRAVELING FROM OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS... JASON. TRAIN A MOVING 85 MILES AN HOUR... I MEANT AN EXAMPLE FROM OUR LIVES. WELL, YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH. WE WERE ON TRAIN B. DAMN IT, BE SERIOUS. OH, YOU WANT A SERIOUS EXAMPLE? YES. OK. HERE'S SOMETHING I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT UPSET YOU. I WILL NOT BE UPSET. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I RAN INTO ALISON VAN DYKE AT THE DRY CLEANER'S. YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND? THAT'S THE ONE. HOW NICE. NOW, WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO TELL ME YOU RAN INTO ALISON? I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I THOUGHT YOU'D... BE UPSET? NONSENSE. DOES SHE STILL STRIP FOR MONEY? MAGGIE, SHE'S AN ARTIST'S MODEL. AND WHAT DOES SHE HAVE TO DRY-CLEAN, ANYWAY? YOU'D THINK THEY COULD JUST HOSE HER DOWN ONCE A WEEK. SEE, THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU. OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT UPSET THAT YOU SAW HER. I'M UPSET THAT YOU HID IT FROM ME. SO, WHAT DID YOU AND THE NUDIST TALK ABOUT? SEE, I KNEW I THAT I SHOULD'VE KEPT THIS TO MYSELF. RIGHT! THAT AND ALL YOUR OTHER SQUALID, LITTLE SECRETS. WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. I'M OFF TO DO A LITTLE JOGGING, JASON. WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS NO NUMBER 37 TONIGHT. I'M TIRED. I'M HUNGRY. I'M BORED. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. I'M SICK OF THIS. I'M SICK OF YOU. AH, THAT'S THE SPIRIT! TELL ME MORE. TELL ME WHAT YOU HATE. I HATE EVERYTHING. I HATE THIS HOUSE. I HATE THIS RUG, THIS SOFA CUSHION, THIS TABLE. I HATE HIS PAJAMAS. WHAT'S WITH HIM? HE'S GOING FOR A RECORD IN COMPLAINING. HE HAS TO COMPLAIN FOR 62 STRAIGHT HOURS. SO FAR, HE'S GOT 2 STRAIGHT MINUTES. I HATE MINUTES. I HATE STOPWATCHES. I HATE YOUR FACE. OH, I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. I HATE GETTING BEAT UP BY PEOPLE BIGGER THAN ME. I HATE PAIN. UH, BEN, LET'S GO UPSTAIRS AND FIND SOMETHING FOR YOU TO HATE. I HATE STAIRS. I HATE THIS CLOCK, AND I HATE THESE CANDLES AND... HI, MIKE. READY FOR THE FIRST CLASS? OH, LYNDA, LOOK, I SAID I'D MEET YOU DOWN AT THE KARATE PLACE. OH, I KNOW. I JUST THOUGHT IT'D BE MORE FUN IF WE WALKED TOGETHER. OH, UM... WAS I WRONG? NO, NO. IT IS OK THAT I'M HERE, ISN'T IT? YEAH, YEAH. LOOK, WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU A TOUR OF THE HOUSE. UH, T-THIS IS THE HALL CLOSET HERE. HEY, DAD. HI, MIKE. YOUR MOTHER COME BACK FROM HER JOG YET? NO, NOT YET. I THOUGHT I HEARD HER VOICE. NO, DAD, THAT WASN'T HER. HEY, MIKE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO USE IN YOU AND I DISCUSSING THIS KARATE THING ANYMORE, UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA BE STRAIGHT WITH ME. NOW, I STILL THINK THERE'S A GIRL IN THIS CLASS. NO WAY, DAD. ALL RIGHT. WELL, MAYBE THERE IS ONE GIRL. BUT WE'RE TALKING FLEA COLLARS AND MILK BONES. THIS GIRL IS THE ELEPHANT GIRL. NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. SEAVER. YOU THOUGHT DEBBIE DIZOMBA WAS AN ANIMAL. HI. HI. OH, DON'T LET ME DISTURB YOU. I JUST THINK I LEFT MY GLASSES IN HERE SOMEWHERE. SO YOU DID. OH. THANKS. DON'T MENTION IT. WELL, THAT'S ALL I WANTED. I WON'T BOTHER YOU ANY MORE. IT'S NO BOTHER. IN FACT, I HAVE A FREE HOUR IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS, MRS. SEAVER. WELL, DOCTOR, THERE IS SOMETHING TROUBLING ME. I KNEW IT. I'M A PSYCHIATRIST. I SENSE THESE THINGS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND TELL ME ABOUT IT? IT'S MY HUSBAND. WHAT ABOUT HIM? HE'S IMPOSSIBLE. I MEAN, I LOVE HIM, AND HE'S A GREAT FATHER, BUT SOMETIMES... DOES HE BEAT YOU? NO. DRINK TO EXCESS? SCRATCH HIMSELF IN PUBLIC? NO. THEN WHY IS HE SO IMPOSSIBLE? BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN TOTAL HONESTY. MRS. SEAVER, ARE YOU BEING TOTALLY HONEST WITH ME NOW? YES. WELL, THERE'S ONE SURE WAY TO FIND OUT. OH. HYPNOSIS. HYPNOSIS? YOU JUST KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE HYPNOTIC TRANCE INDUCER. VERY IMPRESSIVE. NOW MAY I SEE YOU DO WALK THE DOG. NOT FOR THESE PRICES, MRS. SEAVER. NOW YOU'RE GETTING TIRED. YOU CAN BARELY KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. YOU'RE OUT. WORKS EVERY TIME. SO, MRS. SEAVER, YOU ARE NOW INCAPABLE OF TELLING A LIE. AND EVERYTHING YOU SAY WILL BE THE COMPLETE AND ABSOLUTE TRUTH. YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, DOCTOR. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL START WITH A SIMPLE TEST QUESTION. WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK OF YOUR HUSBAND'S RED PLAID BLAZER? HIS RED PLAID BLAZER? MMM-HMM. WELL, I THINK THAT IT REALLY BRINGS OUT THE COLOR OF HIS GUMS. THE WHOLE TRUTH, MRS. SEAVER. I THINK IT'S THE UGLIEST THING I'VE SEEN SINCE CAROL'S SNAKE GOT CAUGHT IN THE DISHWASHER. GOOD. NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. AND THAT AWFUL TIE HE WEARS WITH IT. MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A THRIFT SHOP BLEW UP IN HIS FACE. I ONLY ASKED ABOUT THE BLAZER. JUST BEING HONEST. WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU, MRS. SEAVER. BY ANY CHANCE, AT LAST YEAR'S CHRISTMAS PARTY, DID MARTY BRANDT MAKE A PASS AT YOU? WELL, HOW DID YOU KNOW... WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW I FOUND OUT. DID HE MAKE A PASS AT YOU, OR NOT? WELL, Y-YES. BUT IT WAS NOTHING. I WOULDN'T EVEN CALL IT A PASS. HE ASKED YOU TO GO TO TAHITI WITH HIM. JUST FOR THE WEEKEND. WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I MEAN, DOESN'T A HUSBAND HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW, WHEN HIS WIFE IS PROPOSITIONED? JASON, I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY POINT IN MENTIONING IT. I MEAN, HONEY, I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH MARTY. BESIDES, MARTY'D HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING. OH, I KNOW. BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU TURNED HIM DOWN, HE STAGGERED OVER TO ME, AND BLABBED THE WHOLE SORDID STORY. MARTY TOLD YOU? MMM-HMM, HE CONFESSED. THEN HE BROKE INTO TEARS AND TRIED TO BLOW HIS NOSE ON MY TIE. THE ONE I WEAR WITH MY RED PLAID BLAZER. JASON, I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU. MAYBE. OR MAYBE YOU REALIZED THAT TELLING ME WOULDN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD, SO YOU KEPT IT TO YOURSELF. I ADMIRE YOU FOR THAT. REALLY? MMM-HMM. AND I'M SURE IF MARTY HAD BEEN SOBER, YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME EVERYTHING. AS SOON AS YOU GOT BACK FROM TAHITI. AND I'M SURE YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME IF ALISON HAD BEEN NUDE. RIGHT AFTER WE GOT BACK FROM TAHITI. JASON. I MEAN, DR. SEAVER. THANK YOU. YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL. YES. WELL, IT HAS BEEN A MOST PRODUCTIVE SESSION. MMM-HMM. HOWEVER, THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO TRY WITH YOU. OH. SOMETHING I'VE NEVER TRIED BEFORE WITH A PATIENT. WHAT'S THAT? NUMBER 42. DOCTOR. THERE IS NO USE RESISTING. YOU'RE UNDER HYPNOSIS. MMM, WHO'S RESISTING? WHEN THOSE WORLD RECORD PEOPLE GET THIS LETTER, WE'LL BE IN THAT NEXT EDITION FOR SURE. AH, SO, WHAT RECORD DID YOU GUYS BREAK? MOST FAILED ATTEMPTS TRYING TO GET INTO THE WORLD RECORD BOOK IN ONE DAY. AND THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE. MOM, DAD, CAN I TAKE MODERN DANCE?
