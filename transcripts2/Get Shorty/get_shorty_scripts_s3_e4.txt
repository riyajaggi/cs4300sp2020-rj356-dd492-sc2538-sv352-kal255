I just hope he doesn't keep it in a safe. -Yes, right... Got it. Okay. Yep, I'll let him know. Thank you. Hi, sorry. -Yeah. How long's he been here? -10 minutes. Did you see my e-mail? 'Cause Nathan Harding's been trying to reach you, and I  -No calls...while I'm with him. -Okay, but... -Hi. When Elena said you dropped down, I said, "Keep him there so I can say hi!" You want a coffee or snacks? -Uh, I'm fine, thanks. -It's good to see you. So, what, are you in the neighborhood? -Well, I just thought we should talk in person. Um, if we can... -Alright, yeah. Well, you know, my door is always open. -Right, well, um, first of all, you're an amazing manager. -Aw, thank you. -When we started, you  you told me that I should trust my gut, focus on what I want to do. -Look at where it got us. -The thing is, um... I think I should stay with Kilbaine. -No question. -Really? -You got to stay the course. -Dude, th-that's really cool of you. -When we came to Kilbaine, it was so we'd have more... options, more firepower. But it's still you and me, right? Doing this together... -Bollocks. Have they not spoken to you? -Who? -Mate, uh, you should talk to someone in charge. -Elena. -Hm, yep? -Who did you say was calling? -Uh, Neal Harding. -Who's that? -HR. -Buddy. Am I being fired? Okay, call the guy in props and ask for something less medieval-y. -Less medieval-y. -And, um, in the movie, her skin is emerald green, but this is, like  this is forest. -Those are two totally different colors. -Yeah, can you go now and exchange it? -I can, but you asked me to take notes on that call. -You weren't here last year, and a lot of people say I should've won. The contest is tomorrow. -It's now my top priority. -Thank you. What are you gonna go as? -Uh, to be honest, I've never really been into the whole...dress-up thing  -You have to wear a costume, orthe entire department looks bad. I'm gonna think of something. -Great. That's great. -Hello, this is Ali Egan's office. -Hello, this is Hank Curtis calling from The New York Post for Ali. -Yes, of course, Mr. Curtis. Now, was that the New York Post or The New York Times? -Times,sorry. -Very good. Please hold. -What? -Hey, Ali, I have a reporter waiting on line one. -Okay. Hi. This is Ali. -Miss Egan, my name is Hank Curtis. I'm calling from The New York Times in regards to a former employee by the name of Tracy Martin. Can you verify that Miss Martin worked at Budd E. Boy from July 2013 until her dismissal in August 2016? -Well, I mean, I didn't work with her directly, but, yeah. Why? What's this about? -We're following up about an HR complaint she filed about the company's CEO, Laurence Budd. Do you have any information? -Um... So, this isn't my purview, and if you want to know about a dispute, you have to call Human Resources. -Understood. I appreciate your time. Hey, babe. Hey, babe. Hey, babe. -Hey, someone's home early. I thought I'd catch you at the office. -Yeah, um, just... working from home today. -Oh, it's nice they let you do that. It's going well? -Yeah. Working on deals. -How's my boy? -He's going down for his nap. How's my favorite Broadway star? -Getting through previews. I went up last night in the love scene, a line that I never have trouble with. I totally blanked. It was so embarrassing. -When you say "love scene," you mean...dialogue? -I thought you read the play. -I've been meaning to. It isn't a sex scene...right? Sort of, but it's way PG. -You're kissing somebody? -My co-star. -In bed? -Uh, it  We're under the sheets pretending to have sex. It's It's so not graphic. House lights in five. -Oh, I got to go. H-Hey, don't worry about that scene. It's like comedy sex. -Okay. -Have fun working at home. I'll try you tomorrow. Bye. Mwah. -Yeah. -Mr. Daly. -I'm sorry to bother you, but there's something you should know. Actually, I'm gonna shut this. Uh, has  has Ali been in touch with you today? -About? -Huh. We got a call this morning. I-I was on the line, so I heard most of it. A reporter from The New York Times was asking about a woman called,uh, Tracy Martin? And an HR complaint filed against you. -Uh... Yeah, I vaguely remember Tracy. Uh, I do not remember an HR complaint, and I should get back to this. -Okay, then. And if you were concerned about that story getting out, I'd do what I could to help. -Mm-hmm, I said there is no HR complaint, but you bring it up again, so...-No, just  No, you know how theseaccusations can get out of hand. -Yeah, I have a legal team. Very good at keeping a lid on things. -Sure. -Including assistants who, uh, listen in on calls. -We'll keep this between us. -Excellent. -I'm sorry. I didn't, uh  I didn't mean to overstep, but I just  I figured the fewer people that knew about this, the better, but, of course, the lawyers you have at your disposal, even with all their employees and interns and whatnot, I'm sure everyone will be discreet. I'll leave you to your work. Fuck. -I know. It's a dive bar. But I believe there's a cocktail menu somewhere. -That's not why I came. -Okay. -The, uh, movie with the writer you like, who you want to write "Wylderness II"... -Yeah, Charlie Rudoff, brilliant. -I haven't watched it. -Okay. -I've been busy. -Ah, with what? -Got a call from OVUM. They want to acquire my company. The women's network? -You're not their target demographic. -Are you? "Wylderness" was a work of art. You really want to make holiday movies about the true meaning of whatever the fuck? Come on. You got better stuff ahead than that. -I can't afford an office behind Food For Less. -Trust me, April. We are gonna make some inspired work together. -No. Miles. I moved in with Judah. -I  Can you not see that this  you and me  this is a good thing? Can you not feel that? -I can't do this with you. -Why not? -Because you're two different people, okay? One is charming and funny... -So is the other. -The other person blackmailed me, bled on my floor, and spent two years in prison for working with murderers and drug dealers. -You say that like it's a bad thing. Look, I served my time. And now I have a real job. -It's my fault for starting something we shouldn't have. -Don't say that. -I have to go. -Good night. -Can I get another? Hello? -Enjoying your Friday night? -Not really, no. -Ah. Listen. Been thinking about our conversation earlier, and I think it bears further discussion. -If you think so. -So meet me here tomorrow, 11:00 AM. I'll text you directions. Mm. And if anyone, and I mean anyone, asks, you're coming in your capacity as an assistant. -Which is true. -I'll see you then. -Yeah. Mm, hello. -Hello. -When you said you wanted to leave last night, I really thought you meant it. -I did mean it. -Is that right? -Mm-hmm. -Then why are  -Thanks. Just so I'm clear, Tracy Martin is a real person. -Yes. -But we're not gonna contact her. -No, no, we just need Laurence to think we contacted her. -I try not to judge people, but spying on women while they're in the bathroom? That ain't right. Damn. -Well, would you look at those symmetrical features. I'd forgotten what you looked like. -It's better, right? -I didn't say that. Will you head into the guest room? I'll be in in a minute. -No, you don't to leave on my account. Look, I know I made that speech a while back about going straight for the sake of my family. -Which I thought made a lot of sense. -It's a fucking disaster. Not only do I have zero income, I have more legal trouble than I did with Amara. -About the toaster pastry thing? -They're telling me that the guy needs a skin graft. -Jesus Christ. -The point is, I want to come back. So whatever you got going with Capotillo, whatever you're running at Budd E. Boy, I am in. Please, please do not hold a grudge. -Grud No, it's not  Why would there be a grudge? Look, Lou, I have some big plans, of which you will be part, but now isn't the right time. -Come on. -You're a fucking mess. I'm sorry, but you're a fucking mess. I have my hands in some delicate stuff, and right now you'd be a liability. -I'm fine. -First of all, you need a lawyer. You told Gladys you were going straight. What are you telling her? -I'm not.-You're n You're just gonna  just gonna lie all day every day about everything. No, that's not a plan. You haven't thought this through. - Maybe not. -Look, you'll get yourself sorted out, and when you do, I willwelcome you back with open arms. I love you, buddy. -I know. Let me know how you get on. -What's up, guys? I'm Teala, and I'm here at the Benefresh Hang House with a new line for dental hygiene, and, guys, things are popping off. We got Lark and Daniel ready for battle with the new Tartarsmart Brush by Benefresh. And go! -You think it's lame. -I mean, who even are these people? -That girl  three million followers on Instagram, a million more on YouTube. -Damn. -My friend Josh, Benefresh pays him 15 grand per post. -Per post? Get the fuck out. -Here. -And this mouthwash  it's gonna protect you fromgingivitis and from tooth decay. I swear, I use this stuff every single day, and you guys are going to flip for it. Here we go! -They're paying 15 Gs for that? -Not bad, right? -Yeah! -Whoo! -Benefresh! -Yeah. -Fuck you at? -I'm running late. I told Chewy to start without me. -Not how this works, dawg. You at a party? It's not even noon. -It's one hour, tops. I'll be right there. -Hey, you want to meet Josh? -Oh, it's the back-flip guy? -Yeah. -Pff, let's do it. -Lot of graphic novels. But not none of them are Marvel... -Hello, everyone. -...but, uh  Ah, Miles. I'll be right with you. You hungry? Evette made, uh, Cantonese-style porridge, fish balls... -I'm fine. -Ah. So, uh... ...despite what the Timesreporter said, uh, I did nothing wrong. -Oh, I believe you. -But the lawyers don't always keep quiet... So, hypothetically, if we wantedthe source of the article to retract her statement, you know, how could that be achieved? -Better if I don't say. You need deniability. As far as you know, it just went away on its own. -W-We're not talking about... harming anyone physically. -No, no. -Right. -Not at this point. -Well, I mean, if she thought it was on the table, I suppose it would be okay, right? -I'll start off friendly, see where that gets us. -Ah. -Is this still hypothetical? -If you get results, okay, what exactly would you expect in return? You know, a guy just out of prison... to have the trust of someone like you is enough. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't believe you, but, uh, that's that's fine. Her name's Tracy Martin. She's a vindictive nightmare. That's her cell number, home, work address, and the sooner this is handled  -Agreed. -Okay. Well, see you at the Halloween party. Which, uh, I detest but is good for team morale. -Mm. -Evette. Can't hear me. Just got to Evette! -Right through there. -Thanks. -Laurence is ready. -Well, that's not the bathroom! -There's one by the front entrance. -Ah, someone sent me down this way. But he was speaking Cantonese. -It's ready! - Okay. -Ricky! -Come in. What's this? -I was thinking about Guatemala and how happy we were, you and me in that hut, and I just thought we could have Guatemala in your room. -Oh, mi cielo. -And I'm sorry I took off the other night. I'm thrilled you're back. It's just  It's a lot to process. Being on the run, what that means... -This house is just for now. -Sure. -Mm-hmm. -And, meanwhile, we got the jungle. -After you, m'lady. -I'm glad you called. -I appreciate this. I'm working through something. -You mentioned a marital issue. -So, lying to your wife is a sin. -Dishonesty of any kind. -But there have to be exceptions. Like, if the only way you can provide for your family means you have to lie? -Why would that be the case? -I'm going back into a line of business that I used to be in. Which requires that I do things that she... wouldn't approve of. -What kinds of things? -That's really not the issue. -Seems important if you want absolution for a lie. -No, I've already worked that out with the Heavenly Father. It's the same business that my dad and my uncle were in, and they were very devout  -If you won't open up to me, I-I can't help you. -Yeah. It's complicated. -And if you're using God's teachings to justify your sins  -You mean like you and Elder Kimble's wife taking those long "prayer walks"? -We're done here. -I didn't mean that. That's Bishop? This is important. -Appreciate you stopping by. -I am a member of your flock in a time of need, and you're gonna walk away? You want to know the business I'm in? You don't help me, and I'll show you. -I'll help. I'll help. -We were discussing my wife. -Yes. Well, um, in the  in the book of Nephi, God says, "All who know their hearts, they are honest and accepted of me." Meaning that if  if your intentions are good... -Uh-huh... -...then God will...forgive? -God will forgive? Really? Because I do know my heart. -Well, there you go. -So, um, what else does God say? -Miss Quinn? They're ready for you. -Great. -Miles! Miles. What are you  What are you, just a chest of drawers? -I'm a one-night stand. Get it? -Kind of, yeah. That's cute. -Hey! -Oh. Ali, holy shit. -I mean, am I gonna win this holiday or what? -To think we almost went with a different body paint. So glad we went with the emerald. Uh-oh. -So, are these safe to open? Or you going commando? -Anybody want a drink? -...impressed, maybe both? Have a good time. Okay, now what's  I don't What is this? -I spoke to Tracy. It was definitely her that called the Times. -Alright, let's talk about this later, alright? -Okay. Yeah, no, that's fine. But it didn't go well. -Wait. Tell me. -I tried to talk her down, but, Jesus, I mean, she is out for blood. -Shit. -She just kept saying, "He has to pay. He needs to pay." I thought she was gonna ask for money, but I think she just wants  she just wants to see you crucified. -If she wants war, I will go after her, her family, her pathetic fucking career... Annette. Annette, how's it going? How you doing?-Good. This is my husband, Brad. -Husband Brad, how are you? Good to see you. Hey, be careful of this one right here. -Happy Halloween. -Yeah, you, too. -Tracy doesn't want your money. But you could make a charitable donation, maybe to a cause that's for women? -Interesting. We did a Christmas drive for a-a women's shelter or "Hope Foundation," something like that. -Yeah, write a check for 10 grand? -$20,000. $20,000. You tell Tracy that I will give her $20,000 if  -Yeah, okay, quiet, everybody. Quiet. It's time for the costume contest. -Here we go. To be continued. -Before we start, we're gonna have a few words from the president... -Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. -...Laurence Budd! -You know, uh, everybody talks about the Oscars  eh, Oscars, right? But I think we've got the bestparty in Hollywood here tonight. -Oh, Ricky, you even did the candles. -Yeah. Electric ones. Real ones would be a hazard with this net here. You know, um, when I came back from Guatemala, I made a list of all the things that I loved about our place. -Aww. I want to see the list. -Yeah. Well, I actually wrote a whole screenplay. -A movie? -Yeah, yeah, but I-I threw it away, 'cause it turns out you're alive, and we don't draw attention to ourselves. -I want to read it. -Okay, okay, but that's not my point. I had an idea. What if we found a version of our hut right here in California? Somewhere remote, in the woods. You could go outside without being spotted. -In the woods. -With me. I love being with you. -Hey, also, um  and this is your call  we could sell the engagement ring and then use all that money  -Oh, I give it away. -What do you mean? -The people who bring me to the US, I had to pay them. -With that ring? -Mm-hmm. -Whoa. O-Okay. Uh Uh, I mean, it was worth 130 grand. -No. -Yeah. I mean, it's fine. It's fine. -Oh, shit. -Know what? It got you here. -I did not know this. -No, no, it's good. It's good. -Oof. -Okay. Okay, well... I have prospects. I can take care of you for a change. Yeah, commute from LA, and you could tend the garden or whatever. You are such a nice man. -There she is, our silver medalist. -I'm not doing this again next year. I'm done. -What? You got second place out of the whole company. That's That's a big deal. -Janet did Cruella De Vil two goddamn years ago, meanwhile I'm out here giving a shit. This whole thing is just a popularity contest. -Well, I don't know how that can be true, since you are extremely popular. -I'm not. -And more importantly, they respect you. -I know you're trying to make me feel better. It's very sweet. -Look, Janet won because the accounting department has more people and they pooled their votes. Let her keep her $50 fucking gift card. You are one of the most admired executives in town. And, for the record, you look fuckin' fantastic. -You're right. Screw this party. -Ah, there she is. -I mean, Laurence didn't even spring for passed hors d'oeuvres. -What a stingy cunt. The money he makes, he must spend it all on wigs. -You're really something. -You're not nothing, yourself. -I'm gonna go back to my room. And I'm gonna order a whole bunch of food. And I think that you should join me. -You know, I just had a bunch ofthose pigs in a blanket. Kind of stuffed ooh. -Then we'll just skip right to dessert. -Oh, boy. -Look, you've been doing an amazing job. And I think that you deserve a little reward, don't you? -I'm in room 315. Why don't you just hang back, just for a minute. And then come find me. Have a great night. -Thanks, boss. -Perfect timing. -Why? -Well, this is our last box, and then we are officially moved in. -No way. -So, how'd it go? -My meeting? -Yeah, your huge acquisition meeting, yeah. -I turned them down. -Oh. Alright. I guess they just don't make your kind of movies. -Not really. -Well, that sucks, but at least now you get to focus on your next move. Whatever that is. -Totally. -Okay, big moment. Drum roll, please. With this fork, I officially dub us... ...moved in! -Judah. -Yeah. -I want to break up. -Too bad for you. You already signed the lease. -Are you my one-night stand? Sorry... -Someone had to say it. -So, I took it out of the toaster, and Evan was running past, so maybe he was late or  He was definitely in a hurry  and I was like, "Whoa!" and the Toastie Popz just hit him right in the face. -Uh, Mr. Fonseca believes you burned him on purpose. First of all, I like Evan. And what type of person would intentionally  -Hello. -Could you just give me  give me a sec? It's a childcare thing. I'll be right back. Uh, when Reyna gets back, could you tell her to, uh, keep Wyatt at the park? -What the fuck's this? -Oh, it's the Toastie Popz thing. They just want a statement. I called a great lawyer, so this is a formality. What is this? Is this green paint? -Uh, don't ask. -Buddy, I'm getting my shit together. I'm flying to New York tomorrow to see Gladys. -You decide what you're gonna tell her? -I'm gonna lie my ass off. -Right. -'Cause I know what's in my heart, and I want what's best for Wyatt and her. I better get back to this. -Yeah. Oh, Jesus. Miss Egan, do you think you can have your way with me just 'cause you're my boss? -Just take this thing off before I dock your pay. -Could've picked this up later. -Had to make sure you were feeling okay. You know, when I call a junior lieutenant, usually, they fucking answer. -I was caught up doing that new thing I told you about. And I thought it was cool to delegate. -Hector don't see it that way. -I miss one day and Hector knows? I'm out here trying to disrupt shit, like you said you want me to do,right? -Do it on your own time. This can't happen again. -Hijo de puta. -What you got? -Handling some business. -Fives and singles. High roller. -Yeah? How's this? -Hmm? Huh? -Oh, my God. This needs to go on your 'gram. -Hell yeah. Yeah. Let's be all artistic and shit. Yeah. -Hoo, hoo! Yeah. Yeah? -Yago? Is Amara. -Yeah, right. -Mi frijolito. It's really me. -You got two seconds to tell me who the fuck this is, puta. -See? I'm in LA. -Are we taking this photo? This cash is grossing me out. -I presume this is a butt dial? -Hey. -Hey yourself. -Want to come over later? -Are you and Judah having a house-warming? 'Cause I think I'm busy. -Just you and me. -I can be over there by 7:30. -See you then. -$200,000? -The number she gave. -I said $20,000. How did it get to $200,000? -I have no idea. I-I don't know where she got that figure from. I mean, it wasn't easy, either. She had no intention of killing the story. I had to make it all about helping women rather than her getting revenge. It was... -200 grand. -We could counter. - Fuck. You know what? Just...fuck it. Fuck it, and let's  let's just put this behind us. -Soon as the check clears, she'll retract the statement. -Yeah, they better name a fucking shelter after me. Oh, my God. Alright, well, this this calls for a Sunday cocktail. Scotch? -Lovely. -Yeah. You weren't such a bad hire after all. So, anybody at the office ever ask about our history, working together? -Don't think anyone knows. How could they, since I don't have a credit on "Wylderness"? -Ah, okay. Okay. Okay, so that's what this is about, huh? You want me to restore your producer credit. -Didn't even know that would be possible. -Mm, yeah. I still don't believe you, but, uh, I'll make a phone call. No promises. -That'd be fucking brilliant. Thank you. -Got to get another glass. Everything okay? -Just Ali stuff. It can wait. -I'm impressed you've lasted this long with her. Seems like a real handful. -You have no idea. Shit. -You're back here. -Yep. Don't have any furniture. -I don't care.
