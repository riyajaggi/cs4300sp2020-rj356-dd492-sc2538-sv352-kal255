 I was wondering if you could maybe come down to the station. -The windows are treated with full-spectrum UV protection. So direct sunlight won't be an issue. -Mr. Daly. Have a seat. I'm Detective Mischka. Uh, first thing I want to say is I'm a huge fan. -Of...? -"Wylderness." -Ah. -I just learned that you produced that film with Mr. Budd. -I did. -Yeah. That scene on the boat.

 and we were both  we were tearing up. When the dog chases them... -Ah, you know, a lot of people think that the dog was done by computers, but it was all real. - That's amazing! -Kind of you... -And Laurence, he petitioned to get you a producer credit? -I was grateful. -It says here it was awardedthe day before he died? -I'm not sure, but that  God, that sounds right. Wow. -Would you walk me through what you were doing last Tuesday? -Sure. Sure, I was at work. Laurence didn't come in because he was dealing with that scandal  -Right, but he called your cellphone. -He did. That's right. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah, he was, uh  He was checking up on a film we have in production. -Did you ever work with him at his home office? -I've dropped off packages, yeah. -At night? -At night... No. No, I don't think so. Can I ask why I'm here? -After reviewing the security footage not only at the Budd property, but of the adjacent property on the northeast side, we felt it was necessary to get a statement. -Security footage. What's that to do with me? -Well, you said that you'd never been to the Budd property at night. -That's right. -Nothing you want to add? 'Cause now would be the time. -Yes, I'll let him know you called. -Okay, I'll admit... despite what Laurence did to female employees, which I do not approve of at all... ...in other ways, he's an inspiration to me. Wasan inspiration to me. Look, I-I don't know what you're looking for, but if there's anything I can do to help, any other questions... -Can I have a sip? Hey. Hey, man. Ohh. Oh, please, can I have a sip? I will suck your dick for a s -Hey! How'd you get in here? Are you alright? -Hey. Why are you, uh...? -They don't have my office ready. -I'm sure it won't be long. If you want to wait in mine... -Hoping you'd ask that. -Good morning, Mr. Daly. -I guess word of my promotion is out. -Yeah. That's great. So, uh, I told you to cast this girl for "Making Missy" who looks exactly like Gladys. -Yes, you did. -It's a perfect role for her. -Yes, but that role's already been cast. What? You want me to take a part away from the actress who got it and give it to your wife? -I mean... -Lu, look. Hey, why don't you read through these scripts and find a great role for Gladysthat hasn't been cast already and I'll see if I can get her an audition? -Okay. -Oh. Check this out. This is a house I went to see this morning. -Oh. -I can rent it furnished. View of the Hollywood sign. -Uh-huh. It's all glass. -Uh-huh. -Real hot in the summer. -It's got a pool and four bedrooms. Emma's gonna flip over it. -You know, I-I really don't mind you staying with us. Hey, where were you last night? -Uh, cops pulled me in for questioning. -The homicide cops? -Yeah, I thought it went okay. -Here we go! Triple espresso, dash of milk. In four minutes, you're in Conference Room B with marketing. I'm trying to reschedule DiCaprio, but they haven't returned. Hey, I'm Jayson. -Louis.I'm Head of Physical Production. -So far today, all production work is on schedule. -Did you hear that, Louis?! -Keys to your company car. -I have a company car. -BMW 5-Series, in a space with your name on it. Paperwork for that is on my desk. -Do I have a car? -No, but it's so nice to meet you. Uh, your meeting's now in three minutes. -Alright, I better head in. -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. -Hmm? -Tell me about the, uh, cops. -Trust me, Lu. They've got nothing. We're out of the woods. -And this is our new playground. -So, the cops do not consider you a suspect. -Oh, no, I'm definitely a suspect. But if they had anything, like I was on their surveillance video, I'd already be locked up. -There's a video? -I'll talk to you later. -After a high-profile suicide, we just try to get a picture of the events leading up to the death. We're speaking to everybody in Laurence Budd's inner circle. - Well, I'd hardly call myself "inner circle." We worked together two years agofor a very short time. -Long enough for you to filea complaint against him with HR. -Mm-hmm. -We noticed that your complaint wasn't leaked to the press. Only one that wasn't, in fact. -Really? I thought about going public with my story, reached out to The New York Times, but my boyfriend talked me out of it... -What is your boyfriend's name? -Miles. -Miles Daly? -Yes. -Did you see Miles at all the day Laurence died? -We talked. Things were really crazy at the office that day. The news breaking about Laurence. -You didn't meet up with him for dinner or...? -Dinner, no. He had to work late. -He told us he ate at theNormandie Taqueria around 10:00. -That does ring a bell, actually. Yeah, the Taqueria. I don't normally eat late 'cause it's really bad for your digestion. So... I wasn't with him. -Hey, this business with Leo DiCaprio... -Mm-hmm? -I think we should just bite the bullet, find a new leading man. Maybe somebody a bit younger? -Okay. -Yeah? -If that's what you want, yeah. Ali, there's really no reason for you to be afraid of me. I can tell that you're a bit onthe back foot since the whole... -Blackmail. -We can move on from all that unpleasantness. Productions are on schedule, nobody's trying to sell the company. All I want now is to see you succeed. Because I believe in you. -Mm-hmm. Okay. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. -Alright, I have a lunch meeting, but since DiCaprio won't do a film with Laurence's name on it and our company is literally named after Laurence, I guess that's that. -You could change the name. -What? Of the company? Can we do that? -Yeah. Why not? Um, something less creepy. -Something that says, "We no longer spy on women on the toilet." -We're starting over. -A clean slate. -Clean Slate Productions? -Clean Slate Productions is fucking brilliant! That's You see, that's collaboration  You and me working together. Firing on all cylinders. Do you feel that? Oh, I nearly forgot. This is the next film we're making. -What is it? -This is a synopsis of "Wylderness 2," as conceived by the brilliant Charlie Rudoff. -Is this crayon? -Lumber crayon, yeah. She's a carpenter on the side. I can have Jayson type it up for you if you like. -Okay. I'll take a look at it and let you know what I think. -Ali, that's the next filmwe're doing. So generate a contract for Charlie. I wasn't fucking asking. Clean Slate Productions. Fucking genius. I'm really impressed. -Help! -Truck rentals? That's it? -You know, along with the usual porta-potty deal. -Each truck contract is 10 grand a week, minus expenses. I'm Head of Physical Production,so I can  -That's not what you promised. -It isn't? -All that time and manpower we gave you, and you come to us with "a number" of truck rentals. My friend, I saw your photo in The Hollywood Reporter. You're a senior executive. -You read The Hollywood Reporter? -There'll be more work down the line. I'm not sure what you had in mind. -A couple of menus. Whatever they like. It's on the house. -No, no, no. We're fine. Thanks. -Yeah, popcorn's good. -I want every contract. Drivers, equipment, catering. Plus no-show jobs in every department. -Yeah, I can't do that. -Sure you can. -No, there's investors. There's a board. If we're smart and we don't run the studio into the ground, you'll see profits for years to come. -I see, a long-term plan. -Exactly. -I don't work like that. -What if we start with a few no-show jobs? -Am I negotiating with him or with you? -I'm just trying to help. -Trucks and toilets. That's what I'm offering. You feel you've earned more. I don't know what to tell you. But I have to go. You know how to reach me. -I do know how to reach you. -We'll work it out. Thanks for the popcorn. -Yeah. Almost. -We don't like it. -There's still a bit in here. -I'm good. -I think Wyatt's more of a malt liquor guy. Say, "Nighty-night." -Oh, nighty-night, Lulu. Oh, you mean him. Hey, Shorty. -Hi, Wyatt! Sorry, scrimmage went into overtime. -God, you look so grown up. -Oh, I'm sorry. It's just when we worked together, you were wearing a bonnet. -Yeah, yeah. Her, um  Her look has evolved a bit since "The Admiral's Mistress." We saved you a plate. -Yeah, um, can I eat this in my room? I have a problem set due. -Oh, sure. Just remember that we have to pack tonight. We're picking up the key for the new house in the morning. You are gonna flip over that pool. -Can't wait. Bye, April. -Nice seeing you. -You done? -Yeah. Oh, Ali tells me that you're gonna get, uh, an official offer this week. -Huh? -The board signed off on hiring you, not that it was ever in doubt. -Right. So, I got a visit from the police this morning. -Yeah? What did they want to talk about? -My HR complaint. Guess it was the only one that didn't leak to the press. -That was a bit of luck, wasn't it? -Was it luck? -I don't follow. -I don't have any friends in the HR department. -Hmm. -Maybe my complaint wasn't filed with the others, or... maybe it was held back on purpose? -No, I'd imagine whoever leaked those files probably thought they were doing a public service. -How do you figure? -Well, people deserved to know who Laurence really was, you know? -They asked me about you, too. -Did they? -The night Laurence died, you told them you went out for tacos, but you told me you had to work late. -Okay. Stop. -So  -I just want to know if you  -Fucking stop! Please. Uh... If we're gonna be together, you have to know when to just leave things alone. -What does that mean? -There are aspects of my life, my business, that you just can't ask questions about. I realize that's not ideal. I do. But, April, I have tried the full disclosure route, and it's fucking poison. -Miles, couples don't keep secrets from each other. They don't lie. -I love you. I do. So just trust me. Please. It's the only way this is gonna work. -I mean, during the harvest, we're out here for six, seven hours straight. I used to use sunscreen, but carrot seed oil works, too. -Plus you smell like salad. -Mm-hmm. -Rick? Oh, my God! Rick! Wow! Oh, my God! -What? You You disappeared. I thought... What happened? -Oh, it's such a crazy story. Do you remember my old roommate? -Yeah, I talked to him on the phone. -He was obsessed with paying rent on time. I had to get out of there. -Mm. -How are you? -Me? I'm I'm I'm fine. I'm...I'm No. No. I really I've been going through a tough time lately. Yeah, so I came up here just to think about, I guess, what's next. -Mm. You're searching. -Yeah. -I was searching, too, when I got here. -Yeah. And then what happened? -Well, I found community. I learned to focus on friendshipand love. -Oh, love, yeah. That's nice. -And bok choy. -We grow our own. He should come to dinner. -Oh, my God, totally! Can you? Please say yes! -I-I could eat. -Huh. -I can't believe they just gave you a BMW. You got Sirius radio. Look at this interior. Just... You're thinking about April. -I called her twice, no answer. -She'll come around. -I should've played it different. I should've... I just don't want to make the same mistakes that I made with Katie, you know? Hey, have you found a role for Gladys yet? -Oh. Yeah. Actually, there's one in "Tears From Venus." Character's Tai Lin. -Has some cool lines. What? -If you'd actually read it, you would know that Tai Lin is an elderly Korean man. -Does he have to be? -Fuck! -What the hell was that?! -Outta fucking nowhere, he just slammed on the brakes. Oh, shit! No, don't! Oh! Shit! -So...I guess we know what Hector thought of your offer. -Okay. -I'm not supposed to be out of bed. Had surgery for my hernia. -Surgery? -Laparoscopic procedure. -Well, you're already up. How the fuck did you get a hernia? -Don't worry about it. Take it you didn't find cash. -I'm not here about that. You heard anything that happenedwith Amara? -Why would I? -Her burner's off. I went to the safehouse, door was kicked in. All I could think is Matias and the crew fucking got her. -Or she skipped town. -Well, why would she do that without telling me? She was waiting on me. -You find cash or not? -That was fucked up. I got stuck in that back room, almost fucking died. -Back room? -Yeah. Yeah, telling me that Peewee had it stashed behind the wall? It's all fucking cement. -Cement? Sure you was at the right spot? -32 9th Street. -39 2nd Street. -Whatever. I should take off. -If Amara's gone, then that money's up for grabs, and I'm the one that gave you the code. -You said there was no cash in it, anyway. -But if there is, I'm gonna be there when you find it. With this hernia, I can't do stunt work. -Shit. -Imma get dressed, but if you split, I'm coming after you. -Right. 'Cause I'm afraid of you. -There you are. I've been looking all over. -I still don't have an office. And these bagels are from this morning. They're going to waste. -Listen, I have to head into another meeting, but I need a favor. -Yeah? -I was looking at my phone earlier, while I was watching them tow my car to the shop, and I started thinking, "How are we gonna handle Hector?" -Right. -I think we should take him out. So, that's the favor? You go to a meeting, and I take out Hector. -Pretty much. Yeah. -Buddy, I'm not sure that's a good idea. -I have amazing news! -We're in the middle of a meeting. -The Board loves the new company name. They still have to vote on it, but apparently it's like a done deal. -Well, that is good news. -Right?! -Yeah. Can you shut the door? -I'll do that now. -Listen, pal, you got a lot on your mind  the whole thing with April and the cops and the guys with baseball bats  -Oh, do you have a fucking point? -After what happened this morning, if you go after Hector, they're gonna know it was you, and we are not picking a fight with the cartel. -Fuck Hector! Fuck...him. Look, he is a mid-level banger who is trying to scare us. -I am actually scared. And Hector's more like upper-mid-level. -Well, I am, like, upper-upper level of a multi-million-dollar production company, and if we're getting pushed around by a clown like that, then what's the fucking point? -Okay, I'm gonna pitch you an alternative. You go into the books, you see how much you can pull out for Hector without drawing any attention or sinking the company. -Lulu, I'm not an accountant. -Well, you did it for "Admiral's Mistress." -No, no, Rick did all that shit. We are not hiring Rick. -No. Absolutely not. -I mean, you hate him more than I do. -There's no question. I'm I'm just, you know  I'm just thinking through our options. -Hmm. -You know. -Hmm. -How's your dinner? -Everything's so fresh. -Mm. -And the  the house is nice, too. Everybody, uh  They They get their own private bedroom, or...? -We share everything. I know it sounds a little woo-woo, but it's pretty great. -Hmm. -Folks are gathering to start a fire circle. Do you want to join? -Will you be partaking tonight? -In what, exactly? Oh. Sorry. I, uh I didn't know I got reception out here. -Thank you. -Hmm. -Mmm! It's your turn. -Uh-oh. Peer pressure. -It's safe. -I'm not much of a drug guy. What's in it? -Friends, over here. Gather round. -It's love. -Let's have it stay open. -Well, okay, then. -Oh, yeah, I've got mine. Here it is. -It's behind your ear. -Just back and to the left? -Yup. It was this fucking easy? -Home, sweet home. There's the Hollywood sign. -Wow, I can't believe you have a piano. -Yes, the house actually comes with a pianist. Yeah, he's just taking a break between sets. We're not done. Come with me. And this is your room. -So cool. -I mean, we'll paint it, do the floors. -Why? It's nice like this. -Eh, could be nicer. You know, if we build a loft, you could have your own little duplex. -I don't need that. -No, I know you don't need it.I'm just saying it would be fun. -Can we wait? -Why? -Just till we know for sure where I'm living. -You're living here. Or did I get that wrong? -I'm just feeling guilty about bailing on Mom and Philip. -So, you might go back? Well, poor Philip. You've known him for 18 months. God forbid you hurt his feelings. -Dad, it's not about him. -Are you serious with this? -Dad. Dad. -Did I imagine it, or did you come to me and say that you wanted this? -I did. I mean I mean, I do. I want this. -Have you already discussed thiswith your mother? -Even if I move, I'll still be here a lot. -There's the pool, by the way. I had the guy heat it up just for you. You should do a few lengths before you abandon me. -You're the one that was gone for two years. -And I am trying to make it upto you, if you'd fucking let me. -No, you're not, Dad. This house is for you, so you can feel like the big shot. -Okay, watch it. -The Hollywood sign? It's a fucking cliché! LA, the movies  It's always about you! -Your therapist feed you all that? Is that...? If you're so miserable,just go be with your mother now. Fucking go. Go on. Give Philip my love. Shorty, I didn't mean that. -I'm getting a Lyft to Mom's. -Rick? Come join us. -Amara? Is that you? -Ricky, my love. -Amara. Oh, I killed you. I'm so sorry. -Shh. I forgive you. -I only worked with the Feds 'cause I thought you whacked Banana Girl. But she's fine. -Be free, Ricky. Live your life. Find love. -Are you sure? 'Cause a threesome's  It's kind of a lot for a-a rebound. -I release you. -Thank you, Amara. -Don't worry about it. -Seven hundred large, at least. Can't tell how much the jewelry's worth, though. This is a fucking game changer for me! I've been having ideas lately, too. What I'd do with financial independence, you know? Business prospects. -What about Capotillo? Fuck Capotillo. They don't need to know about this. -Alright, then. -So, what are you gonna do with your half? -First, we need to figure out how we're gonna split it up. -Well, you take the jewelry. I'll take the cash. -Like that's doing me a favor? -Well, one of the watches could be worth half a mil. Well, what's your great idea? -I got a guy down in San Dimas that can fence it. Call him and get an appraisal. -Fine. Call him. You two, meet me in my apartment tomorrow. -Let you keep the cash? -What, you don't trust me? -So I'll keep the bag. -Well, now I don't trust you. -Hello? -I heard you had some car trouble yesterday. -I'm still finding pieces of glass in my ear. -Well, maybe you thought more about what you bring to the table. -Yes, and I have good news. Five more contracts, two year-round. Course, the work will still need to be done in a reasonable fashion. -Oh. Contracts for what? -Van rentals and greens. - Come on. -I'll have to look at the list, but taken together, it's a significant amount  -You know what your problem is? You only think about yourself. All the people that helped get you where you are, you don't give a shit. Even your daughter's pissed off. -What's that? Don't fucking mention my family. -Mm. Emma, right? Yeah, she seemed upset when she left last night. I hope she got to school okay. -What? Come on. -Hey, it's Emma. Leave a message. -Yeah, is is Katie there? This is her ex-husband, Miles.

This should ensure that we all profit from the success of Clean Slate Productions. -I'm accepting the offer, unless you have a problem with it. -If that's what you want, it's good with me. -These are amazing. -Which? The salmon? Give me one, will you? Hector, would you like a scone? A scone? No? You're missing out. Mmm! Hey, your boy's running late. -Probably hit traffic in the valley.
