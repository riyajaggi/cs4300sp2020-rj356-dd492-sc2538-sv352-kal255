 Previously on Bunheads... We have land and we're not doing anything with it. We gotta make money off this place. Get out the gold stars, we have come up with a plan. Fanny:- A great plan. - We're going to build an amphitheater. I just don't understand how they got so popular so fast. Cozette can do anything. Cozette's a wizard. I was wondering if you were in the market for any new business ventures. An amphitheater? Really? To the Millicent Stone Performing Arts Center. Ginny: She's magic and perfect and worldly.

 And so so hip. She's Carnaby Street in pointe shoes. - Are you Dutch? - I... Your face reminds me of a Vermeer. It does? What are you doing here? Clearly this isn't going to happen. This isn't gonna happen? Yeah, it doesn't really seem like you want this to happen. - Well, I do. Bye! - Great. Bye! ( Piano playing ) Tour jete, hold. Releve and... Tour jete, hold. Releve, nice.

 Tour jete, hold. Releve. Shoulders, Ginny. I don't know what you mean. Show me what you mean? Not falling for that again. - Rats. - Nice try though. Jump, children. Jump! Just put the stuff over there. - Where? - There. - Yeah. - Not there. - There. - Where? - Right there. - Where is there? Sam: There, next to that. Sal: You'll make me lose my mind. Oi, Tony, Carmella, I'm teaching a class over here. Sorry, the man can't follow a point. You need like air traffic controller sticks just to help him figure out where to put a dance bag. I'm sure, but you can't just... Okay, everyone. All right. You can stop that. It's annoying. Places in the center. Stretch. Tap class doesn't start for another 30 minutes. I know, but last time I got here too late to get the good spot. - What's the good spot? - Front left center. Best acoustics and everyone's behind me so when the sweating starts, I don't smell a thing. Thanks for all the unnecessary information. - Why is Sal here? - I do not know. You know. He's going to take tap. - Really? - No. He runs a dancewear store. He should know how to dance. I do not need to know how to dance. I need to know about dance. And I do. Those three back there, they're terrible. All you need to know. - It'll be good for you. - It will not. - You will enjoy it. - I will not. I needed a ride. Give it up Sal, you've been sammed. Okay, everybody up. Remember the combination we did yesterday? Let's do that again. Too lazy to come up with something new? Too lazy to do a triple pirouette - at the end instead of a double? - Yes. Let's start a club. Um, oh, by the way. We finally scheduled your meeting. Oh, great. So relieved. You know which meeting? The rabbi, the priest, and the duck in the bar? Your meeting about approving the amphitheater. - Taftpokirip. - That's the association for the preservation of keeping it real in Paradise. Know the acronym, quashing the chuckle. We were supposed to go over your plans, your permits, make sure everything's in order, blah blah blah. But we hadn't gotten around to it. Someone misplaced the post-it to remind her. Whatever. But we found the post-it and it's happening next week. Great. What do I need to do? - Nothing. - A reminder follow-up call or two might be prudent. ( Phone rings ) Oh, that's me. Hold on. That's okay. Just take your time. While we're waiting, we thought we'd form a rock band. Oh, we hear the Stones met like this. Very busy here. Batten down the hatches, baby. - Mama's coming to town. - What did you do? Nothing you wouldn't do. You didn't drive through three states in a convertible wearing nothing but the words "free speech" painted on your butt? - No. - Like the Dixie Chicks' "Entertainment Weekly" cover? - I got the reference. - 'Cause I would totally do that. - I have no doubt. - And no one would care. I think a couple of kids at a stoplight might have a bit of interest. And a new screensaver. - Are you coming to visit? - I am. - When? - In a couple days. - Can you handle it? - It's not me, it's the liquor stores I'm worried about. - What's the occasion? - I just miss my girl. - And? - And I have something big to tell you. Government secrets? 'Cause I'm not good at keeping that stuff quiet. - I'll be there soon. - I've got putin on speed dial. - I can't wait to see you. - As soon as I learn to speak Russian, - things are gonna get rough. - Muah. Muah. - Talia's coming. - Really? Yeah, I haven't seen her in a while. So great. - It is? - Oh, I should clean up my place. Set up the couch. Buy some snack-y stuff. Finish teaching class. Finish teaching. Crap. Eventually I'm going to claim the moral high ground in this relationship. Yeah yeah. All right, fifth position. ( Piano playing ) Arms one, and two. ( Theme music playing ) Bunheads 1x16 - There's Nothing Worse Than a Pantsuit Original air date February 11, 2013 Sync and corrections by atrn97g for www.addic7ed.com Why can't we order fries? It's a special menu for the fundraiser. There's nothing on here. There's fish and chips, a salmon sub, tuna dog, and calamari shooters. But I want fries. You can have fries. Fish and chips. - Chips are fries. - What happened to the real menu? - It's a special menu tonight. - Why? Because it's a special event. It's just a shorter menu. Same crap, but less of it. - Yes. Special. - Your drinks, my ladies. - What are you doing? - Getting drinks. From the bar. You order drinks from me. - I couldn't find you. - How hard did you try? You mean, did I send out a search party? No. - You got me. - You buy the sodas from the bartenders, they get the tips. They don't need the tips. They need baths. And syphilis medication. I need this. I'm going to Harvard. Not on this lame special menu, you're not. What special menu? It's a stupid special menu. You can't order fries. You want fries? Don't you order fries from the bartender. I mean it! Don't you do it! Man. You writing the great American novel there? "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." Sorry, that's taken. Really? Oh shoot. I'll just have to start again. ( Cheering ) ( Both chuckling ) Rico: All right, all right. Don't get nuts. We'd like to welcome you guys - to the first... - Second. Second annual fundraiser for the Surfers United Retirement Fund. ( Cheering ) Enjoy the movie. Whoo! Don't say I never did nothing for you. What is this? ( Gasps ) Oh my God. You are my hero. Right here. Where'd you get those? I don't know. They just appeared. We thought they came from you. Hey. You really can't see that I'm busy? Did you go next door and buy those burgers - and bring them in here? - Yes I did. You can't do that. I'm your waiter! - You wouldn't bring them. - I'm not supposed to. It's a theme night, damn it. Why can't anyone understand that? Dude, if I tip you to go away, will you? A good tip, post tax. You have got to get some sort of life. I know. Again, from the top. ( Chuckles ) ( Indistinct movie chatter ) - Surfing's boring. - I know. Hey, you hear they're doing "Bells Are Ringing" - for Spring Musical this year? - No. Well they are. I'm thinking of trying out. Give me something to do other than watch myself age into my mother. Wow, thanks for completely ignoring me. We're not ignoring you, Ginny. You said you were gonna try out for "Bells Are Ringing." And no response? - Nope. - Thanks a lot. Because every year you say you're gonna try out - and you never do. - You chicken out every time. That's not true. Maria in "West Side Story." Who's gonna believe me as Puertorican? - "Li'l Abner." - I got the day mixed up. I was gonna do it. I bought the Daisy Dukes. Yeah, and I wore them for Halloween. Whatever. ( Sasha chuckling ) ( Chuckles ) ( Laughs ) So this is how it's gonna be at prom. What? Boo's gonna be with Carl. Sasha's gonna be with that guy. And you and me are gonna be by the punch bowl watching handsies and thumbsies make out all night. - Sounds great. - What? Prom is awful. We won't have to buy a dress, or pay to have our hair done or rent a limo. We can go in jeans, and we can eat 'cause we won't care if we look like pigs or if anyone's gonna try to touch our bloated stomachs. Or worry if we're gonna have to give it up for a lobster dinner. We can just chill or not even go. That's even better. - That sounds awful. - Why? Because I kind of want to consider giving it up for a lobster dinner. Well, at least we have each other. That's something, right? Your pics. - What? - Your skating pic. You need an official photo, so I took some of you at the last practice. Wow, some of these are actually great. We spent a summer on Annie Leibovitz's yacht. Got some tips and some really expensive parting gifts. ( Scoffs ) I'll be right back. ( Girl chatters ) So, if you give me your number, I'll get you some fries. All right. Oh, geez! Milly, what the hell? We have a major problem. How did you get in here? Taftpokirip is convening a meeting to discuss the amphitheater. We have an alarm. Nothing good ever comes from these people meeting. It was set. The alarm was set. I should have known something was up. It's my job to know when something's up. How did you disable the alarm? Michelle, please. I own property. That explains nothing. We have to nip this in the bud. These local yahoos are always causing problems. They never want anything to change ever. Electricity freaked people out at one point. And water. Let's live together in filthy quarters and not bathe. The apes are still shaking their heads over that one. What could their problem be? We did everything right. We filled out all the paperwork. I didn't even sign in pink ink 'cause Fanny told me not to. If there's not a real problem, they'll invent one. That's what people do instead of reading a newspaper. Well, crap. This is terrible. They made it seem like it was nothing. Just another standard meeting. Who did? Sal and Sam. You talked to Sal and Sam? - Yeah. - When? - Yesterday. - Yesterday? Uh, yeah, they came in and they... And what? They came in and what? They told me about the meeting? You knew about this? - Sort of. - You knew about this and you didn't call me? I was with the tutus. Always. Always call me. The minute anything happens that can't be answered by reading a Judy Blume novel, call me. This is how they got The Edge, you know. The Edge? U2 The Edge? All the man wanted to do was build some eco-friendly houses in Malibu. And the next thing you know, they scheduled a meeting. - Geez. - I told him, "Edge, get back there and stop that meeting." I don't care what crazy crap "Julie Taymor's doing." Didn't listen. You know The Edge? Like personally? We carpooled for a while. Never count on a rock star to get a kid to a piano lesson on time. Hey, how about we do something to butter them up? Like stage a ballet for a town festival or something? The Edge tried that too. Appeasement. He offered to put in a park. A dog run. He even offered to play "The Joshua Tree" in its entirety at one of the kids' birthday parties. And do you know what that got him? - Nothing? - Man's still sitting there with his thumb up his backside. And I'm assuming he need that thumb to play, so... We need to move quick, intervene, throw them off their game. - Great. How? - We need to schedule a meeting. But we already have a scheduled meeting. No, we need to schedule a meeting before their meeting. So like a pre-meeting meeting. A preemptive meeting. Home turf advantage is not just for football anymore. - What? - Class is supposed to start at 10:00. Hey, you don't tell us when class starts. We tell you when class starts. Class actually does start at 10:00. But 10:30 would work great too. ( Mouths word) I'm sorry. I'll be nicer to you tonight. I promise. Roman? Who were you just talking to? My plant. Martha Stewart says you should talk to your plants. - She's weird. - She's Martha. So what are you doing here? Well, I am here to drive you to school. What? Drive you to school. - Why? - Because. I have a car. I know. But I'm here now and we're heading to the same place, so why not? Well, 'cause I have a car. And it works, so... Sasha, I've decided it's time to take this thing public. You, me, us. Like we're Facebook? Like what couples do. Normal couples. They hang out together. They drive places together. People know they're together. - Okay. -I'm gonna make it easy on you. First, you're gonna close your door and walk with me down the hall. Want to say good-bye to your plant? ( Sighs ) See you, Ralph. And we're gonna go to school and walk up the steps together. - Do you understand? - Vaguely. Accept it. Accept it. You're a freak. We'll work on terms of affection later. ( Bell rings ) ( Sighs ) Hey, how was class? Big fun with calculus. What's up? Well, I figured since driving to school and walking up the steps went so well, that we should take it a step further. What's a step further? - Lunch. - What? These really are not super foreign concepts. I eat with my friends. So we'll eat as a group. I like your friends. I think. If they're as nice as Ralph. You're North quad. We're South quad. I'll get a passport. Are we doing the arm thing again? I'd expect it. Breathe. - Breathe. - So Mel, you're telling your mom you're staying the night at Boo's. Go there early, call her from the landline, - and you're covered. - Got it. And Boo, you're telling your parents you're staying at my place. Come over, call your mom from the landline, and you're covered. So Melanie and I aren't staying at the same place? Yes, Boo, you're both staying at Sasha's. - Where are you staying? - At Sasha's. I'm confused. We're all staying at Sasha's, Boo, but these are just the stories we're telling the parents and we have to get them straight. Go over it again? Roman's gonna have lunch with us. Deal. Hi, everyone. - Hey. Hello. - Hey. - Hi. - Awkward. Here okay? Melanie: I guess. Ginny: Roman, would you excuse us? - Really? - For just a minute, please? Okay. Guess I'm stepping away. Stay close. - What are you doing? - This was his idea. It's some sort of mating ritual. Is he your boyfriend now? I guess. So it's "official" official? There's been no formal announcement in the press, but yes, it's official. So we can tell people. Yes, tell people. Geez. You just play everything so mysterious. Especially when it comes to boys. - I do not. - The last time I asked you about a boy it was in the third grade, and it was about Jimmy Kuwolski. The ski man. You punched me. I got a bruise. Didn't like talking about the ski man. You guys knew Roman was around. You've seen me texting him. Mysteriously. You've never even said his name. Well, I'm saying it now. - Roman. - And what do we do about lunch? - We eat it. - It's only ever been us girls. - We have rules. - We don't have rules. We have customs. And customs change. I never let Josh eat with us, and Josh and I were together eight years. He worked in the cafeteria, so he couldn't. I miss those free brownies. Climb aboard the train, girls. Come on. It's leaving the station. Fine. I don't know what to talk to him about though. We can talk about basketball. - Right? - Already asleep. Even he doesn't talk about basketball. Okay, but we can't talk about what we talked about yesterday. Yeah, that would be embarrassing. Okay, so we can't talk about what we talked about yesterday or basketball, but we can find other things to talk about. Bring him over. ( Whistles ) ( Clears throat ) So, is Wilt Chamberlain still alive? These are the theater's potential tax benefits for the entire town? - It's not enough. - It's what I came up with. You figured in flower shops, restaurants, - parking lots? - Souvenir vendors, gas stations, Mini-Marts. - Pot dealers? - What? There are people who are going to want to spark up before the ballet. Put it in. I'm definitely not putting that in. Then close your eyes and I'll put it in for you. You know pot's only legal with a doctor's prescription, right? So, have a panic attack. Fake a migraine. I won't need to fake one in a minute. You wear glasses, use that. Michelle: Leave Eric alone, Milly! Just focus on your own thing. Jayden. Are you in yet? I'm into Sam's. Dopey chick's password was her cat's name. Super easy hack. Michelle: Did he say hack? Are you guys hacking? This Sal guy's desktop has got some sort of advanced firewall. I gotta go through the local mainframe, but I'm almost in. Michelle: There should be no hacking going on. Rebekah Brooks. Rebekah Brooks. It's just information gathering, Michelle. I have a stack of files on every person in this town. Trust me, it comes in handy. Michelle: Do you have a file on me? I brought the necklaces you asked for. Bold, beaded, something Hillary Clinton would wear - to Bangladesh. - She makes killer bead choices. - Go with black. - There's so many buttons. And every time I button a button, there's another button to button. Michelle, just come out here please. ( Sighs ) And I was expecting thunderous applause. - Get that away from me. - Nope, stand still. I could play with the crotch a little. Best offer all day. It's not the crotch. Guys, I'm not really a pantsuit kind of gal. How about a dress? No. It has to be a pantsuit. There is nothing more intimidating than a pantsuit. We could try to do some color blocking on it. Unless color blocking is code for destroy, it won't help. ( Cellphone ringing ) That's Sal. He's calling from his bathroom. Thanks, Jayden. Hey there, Sal. No, I'm sorry. I know the change was abrupt, but I'm out of town next week and this is so important to us, you understand? I'll tell you what, I'll supply some snacks, make it more like a party than a meeting. Yes. And to you and yours, Sal. ( Phone beeps ) Michelle, how long does it take - to put on a jacket?! - It's on. I'm just sad. We're gonna need bigger beads. Truly, show me where you keep your jumbo beads. Jumbo beads? I love jumbo beads. Talia, save me! What is going on here? ( Groans ) - What is this? - It's a pantsuit. I know what it is, I just don't know why it's wrapped around your body. We're having a preemptive meeting with the town elders about our amphitheater. And apparently, if I wear this, they won't get us like they got The Edge. - Because it's weaponized? - And there's beads. - I missed you. - I missed you too. What's with "The Social Network" over here? Oh, this is our super team. That's accounting, that's our hacker. I don't know those guys, but they freak me out. And this is our board room. Have a seat. Truly: - Don't sit. - Sorry, Truly. Truly, hey girl. - Hey, girl. - Love the hair. Oh thanks, it's just a new thing. - Talk to me. - What? What do you mean what? You're the one who drove all the way down here with this mysterious big news of yours. I need to know. Spill. Okay. Rick proposed. ( Gasps ) Whoa, really? Did he get down on one knee? 'Cause that can be fatal at his age. He did not get down on one knee, but he did spell it out with rose petals. Wow! What did you say after, you know, you stopped throwing up? - Nothing yet. - What do you think you're gonna say? Well, as I was leaving and I'm kissing my Ricky good-bye and he was all sweet and adorable, I was like, "definite yes." - Yay. - Then I stopped at Peggy Sue's on the I-15 and there was this table of incredibly hot guys right next to me, so it was "no." Oh. Then I stopped at a really cute store in Cambria. Credit card got declined, so it was "yes" again. Then I got a flat tire, this guy pulls over, changes it for me, very cute. Very Jon Hamm. I like Hamm. - So... right? - No. Then I drove for another hour, really thought about it, - and... - I'm hearing a drumroll. ( Gasps ) It's a yes. Big shiny yes. Oh, I'm so happy for you. Congratulations. Thanks, Trules. So, drinks and then drinks? You know my rule. One drink per karat. So we're getting wasted tonight. Not in the pantsuit, you're not. I swear it doesn't have to be like this. - What, your sandwich? - No, this. Talk. Please talk. About whatever you want. I beg you. But we don't know basketball. I don't care about basketball. Ginny: Okay, fine. Let's talk. You know, I was rewatching "The Notebook" the other day, and I came up with a whole new theory. Anything but "The Notebook." Well, I watched "The Vow" the other night, and I couldn't figure out why... All Rachel Mcadams movies are off the table. - Boo. - Carl. What's wrong? I thought your lunches were an all girl thing. They were. - Sasha changed it. - I didn't change it. Roman changed it. Hey, I'm Roman. Carl. I didn't know you could just change the rules. I didn't know you could just change them either. There were never rules. Well, if there are no rules, I'm sitting here. Don't mind me. Just keep doing what you're doing. Good luck with that. What the hell? Whatever. Just saw these guys here, so I figured "hey." Impeccable logic. Great. So this is a couples' table now. - Is that was this is? - Dez and I are not a couple. Yeah, it's not like we've even kissed or anything. You want to kiss? You know, as long as everyone is hooking up, I might as well go and ask Frankie over. How about that? I'll just ask him over. Hello? You turn into a puddle whenever you're around him. I do not. No, you get liquid-y pretty quick. ( Distant indistinct chatter ) ( Bell rings ) ...Seven, eight. ( Piano playing ) Okay, okay. A little bit faster, Brad. More Ramones, dude. All right, a little bit faster. Okay. - ( Piano plays faster ) - ( Vocalizing with beat ) Okay, everyone. Thank you. Nice work. No no no no... no need for formalities. Move it. Move it. Clap while you're walking. Clap while you're walking. I need my dance bag. There you go. Move it. Mama's got a pantsuit to get into. Hey stragglers, vamoose. ( Murmurs ) Hey, do you guys want to come see me at Derby tonight? I can get comps. - Yeah, I'll go. - Sasha, you in? Can't take the toilets. What about you? - Me? - Yeah, want to be my cheerleader tonight? No, I can't. Homework. Michelle: All right, 5:00. The studio's officially a "no kid" zone. Anything or anyone up there is going out the window if they're not out in 30 seconds. - Do you want a ride? - I'm gonna walk. To each his own. ( Indistinct chattering ) ( Sighs ) I feel very uncomfortable. You look terrifying. Oh. Well, thanks. So, what do you think they're talking about over there? They're talking about the fact that I promised snacks and they don't seem to be here. Really? How can you tell? Michelle, please. I own property. Okay, we've let them stew long enough. Let's get this show on the road. Hello, everyone. I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. We are so grateful that you were able to juggle your schedules around like this. Obviously we have lots to talk about today. Yeah, you said there was gonna be snacks. Did I? My goodness, Sal. Apologies. I have no memory of that. Should I send someone to the store to get us some crudites? - No. - Okay then. Why don't we just get going then? I see you brought easels. Easels mean presentations. So since it seems like you have things you want to present, I cede the floor to you. Oh, I can sit now? Great. Joe: I can't find the permits folder. Do you have the permits folder? Stephanie: I put it over there. I didn't eat because she said snacks. None of us did. Crudites is not snacks. I can't eat anything raw ever. - It's death. - I hate Kale. Sal: Kale. Kale is terrible. I got the folder. Okay, we're ready. ( Sighs ) Michelle: Why is he looking at my beads? They look like meatballs. Sam: Sorry, we were a little disorganized. Okay, so we have looked through all of your papers and as far as we can see, everything seems to be in order. Oh, good. That's good, right? Maybe this is going to be easier than you thought. So, the only thing left to discuss is the environmental impact that this construction will have on our community. What does that mean? This is a photograph of your land in 1937. Notice all the trees. Trees that currently are no longer there. Where did they go? I don't really know. You should. You're wearing the pantsuit. Sal: By our estimation, you're planning on felling at least eight more trees. No, absolutely not. We have no plans to fell any trees. I think. I actually have no idea what felling a tree would be. Cutting it down. Oh, then yeah. We're gonna fell a bunch of trees. - Ha! - We have to make room for the stage. Well, what about the squirrels? - The... - Squirrels live in trees. You take out the trees, you are displacing the squirrels. Where are they going to go? Well, can't they just move to another tree? - Wow. - Heartless. That's why we have a Taftpokirip. Sam: Just move to another tree. What if you stored your nuts in a tree and then you went out one day, you came back and poof, that tree was gone? You're kidding, right? You're a squirrel. What are you going to do? Sue? Go to squirrel court? Say "some lady took my nuts"? Yeah yeah. I really am having this conversation. What if the tree you cut down was the tree that that squirrel raised his kids in? Or he was raised in? Yes, what if it was his childhood tree? What do you say to him? - Or her. - It absolutely could be a her. You're going to send some poor single mother squirrel out into the wild to find another tree? When did she become a single mother squirrel? When you took down the tree her husband was sleeping in. Well, I guess I would say "Mrs. squirrel, if your husband is just" "laying around the tree all day" "while you're out slaving away" "to put nuts on the table," "then you dodged a bullet, my friend." You're not taking this seriously, are you? No, I'm not. Sorry. All you pantsuit wearers are the same. Not concerned with anyone but yourself. You know, when I heard about The Edge, I thought "this story can't be true." "There must be more to it than that," but clearly it's completely true. No one comes into this community and does whatever the hell they want. Yeah, especially not after "Pop." I paid full price for that turkey. Look, we're just trying to do something nice for the community. Bring in something new and artistic to this place. What a snob. We don't need you to enlighten us. We have two community theaters and a Color Me Mine. We're done. - Thank you. - And we'd like our cheese. ( Loud, overlapping chatter ) Really? No no no wait. You haven't... you only have talked about the squirrels and trees and Color Me Mine. ( Arguing continues ) Okay, everyone. These pants are supposed to cut me like that. Sorry. Okay. Well, I think we've... heard all of your concerns. Seen your presentations. Now... let me tell you all how this is gonna go down. Oh God. Where is it? Where are you? Come on. Come on. - Looking for something? - Ah! Oh my God. You spooked me. Don't spook me. I didn't mean it. Sorry, it's just you spooked me. What are you doing? Homework. It's quiet here. This? This is quiet? There are several adults yelling downstairs. My mom just found out that Faye Mendelson and my dad are trying to conceive. Believe me, it's much more quiet here. - I'm sorry. - Par for the course. Well, Ginny, here's what I've learned tonight. If you're gonna have a meeting, have snacks at that meeting. You should be writing this down. Because without snacks, people don't know what to do with their hands and they get grumpy. Snacks. Ginny, snacks. Snacks. Good. Now, have you seen a jacket that looks like this one but without all the sweat stains? No. But I'll help you look. Truly said she'd leave me a spare somewhere. I've just been soaking through this all night. I don't think I'm cut out for legal issues and pantsuits. I wore my first pantsuit when I was nine. My mom was selling a house using the baby angle. So I was basically born in a pantsuit. Dress guards are my savior. Dress guards. But honestly, they'd have to be industrial strength. 'Cause I'll level with you, I don't perspire. I freaking sweat. Here. Oh, thank you. This is excessive, even for me. I was in a donkey costume for an experimental production of "Don Quixote" and I didn't sweat this much. Hey, you've auditioned for lots of stuff before, right? Hit me when I'm down. That's not nice. They're holding auditions for "Bells Are Ringing" at school on Friday. Oh, I know that show. I like that show. I going to audition for the touring company once, but the night before, I threw up on the choreographer. - Oh, you got sick? - No, I... Yeah. So I missed the audition. And if you think this is a lot of sweat, you should see me after I throw up on a choreographer. Well, I was wondering if maybe you'd help me prepare for the audition for "Bells Are Ringing" at school? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. Really? Tomorrow afternoon? Sure. Yeah, sure. Sal: Millicent! Where the hell did you get those pictures?! Oh God, I better get back down there. Talia, stop stealing the silver. God, that is the best shower I have ever been in. - Don't say it. - What, that you've been in a lot of showers? - I wouldn't dream of it. - Thank you. Think Fanny will mind that we're staying in her house? - No. - Think she'll mind I used all her lotion? - No. - Think she'll ever know that we stayed in her house and I used all her lotion? No. Wow. Champagne and pizza. Are we dating bowling champs again? Nope. We're celebrating. - Yes. Celebrating what? - Whoo! We got the community board to sign off on the amphitheater, - so we're good to go. - Well, congratulations. My first pantsuit victory. And I have to say, at first, I was all against the whole concept, but now I get it. It's binding. So it keeps all your powers in. Plus, there's no potential "Basic Instinct" moment. So suddenly you're not thinking about how you're sitting and you'd be surprised how much brain space that frees up. Plus, the pockets. Dance clothes never have any pockets, but this suit has pockets everywhere. And... You can do that. I have always wanted to do that. - To Hillary Clinton. - Hear hear. Drink up. I want to take my new pantsuit out for a spin. See if guys can pick up on my new polyester super powers. ( Cellphone rings ) ( Phone beeps ) Vegas. Hello? This is Talia. - Who? - Is it Rick? Is he dead? What? No. Why would you say that? You had a "my ancient boyfriend might be dead" look on your face. Shh. Yeah, no. Of course I do. How have you been? Wow. That's pretty good. Uh-huh. You're kidding. You're kidding! You're kidding. - I don't think they're kidding. - Well, I don't know. I'm not really... um, okay. Sure. I will talk to you later. - Whoa. - What? Do you remember Andy Donnelly? - The one who only wears bike shorts? - No. - The one who punched Don Rickles? - No. He was at Crazy Horse Paris when I worked there, remember? - A bunch of years ago? - The choreographer. - Sort of. - Sort of? - He parked cars. - How is that sort of a choreographer? - The parking lot was very tricky. - Right. Anyhow, we had like a two week thing, and I haven't talked to him for eight years and now he's one of the producers - of "Rock Of Ages." - Are you serious? Yeah, and he has a part to fill ASAP, - and thought of me. - After eight years he thought of you. - Just like that? - I guess so. You sleep with a guy for two weeks and eight years later, he just thinks of you for a part. - What are you implying? - That you are really good in bed. - Well, duh. - Wow. A part. "Rock Of Ages." - New York? - Touring for now, but they pull a lot of their Broadway replacements from the touring company, so it's not out of the question. New York! Geez, that's great. Yeah, he's gonna call later with details. - So? - So... So why aren't you excited? I am. I just don't know if I can do it. Sure you can. Have you seen "Rock Of Ages"? - Michelle... - My pantsuit could do "Rock Of Ages." - I just got engaged. - So? So I'm just supposed to up and take off? I could be gone for like a year. He could go with you. Most hotels have wheelchair ramps now. Rick does not want to follow me around on tour, and New York is out. Ricky hates New York. So you're just gonna turn it down? I don't know. It's just so out of the blue. It's crazy! I've been sitting in Vegas on my ass for five years, and nothing. The minute I get engaged. I guess when it rains, it pours. I guess so. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. It's nice to be thought of though. It is. It definitely is. Well, I guess this is to you then. We both have something to celebrate tonight. Yeah. - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. I'm gonna take this pantsuit off. Pizza, sauce, you know. ( Door jiggling ) ( Chuckles ) Hi. Hi. - Was the door locked? - No. - Was it stuck? - No. ( Sighs ) Well, it's a stupid knob anyhow. You been waiting long? Nope. Hour, hour and a half tops. Sorry about that. Was out late celebrating with a friend. The day kind of got away from me. She had a good night eight years ago, and look at her now, right? I got a pantsuit rash. - Yikes. - Yeah. Okay, so what are we doing here? Well, it's called "A Perfect Relationship" from "Bells Are Ringing." I have to sing and there's a little routine. And I set up a switchboard because she works at... Okay, right. So, should I just jump in? Both feet. What you got there? - I've got the song. - On that? - Yeah. - No more cassette tapes, huh? - That's old lady crap now? - What? Uh, yeah. Go ahead. I had to use cassette tapes. - What? - Babbling. Moving on. Never turn up your nose at a valet parker. - Okay. - It's a good tip. - I'm sure. - They have long memories, those guys. Right.

There are things known, and things unknown. And in between are the doors. What does that mean? Go in. Right. Well well well, there she is, ladies and gentlemen. The conquering hero returns. Thank you. Thank you very much. I can't believe you actually did it. You actually auditioned for a school play. Why didn't you tell us? I did tell you and you mocked me. - We did. - We have been silenced and chastened. We heard you were great. You did? From who? And did they say great or really great? Ally was working on sets and she said everyone was talking about you. Were they? How dear. - What? - She's being obnoxious and pretentious. Well, us in the biz have to have a healthy ego. - That's how we survive. - How'd you finally get the nerve? I asked Michelle to coach me. - You're kidding. - She was mean and called me names, and then she showed me how good she is and how bad I was, and then she threw her water on me. Though I'm not sure that was totally on purpose. - Sounds awesome. - It was awesome. Because if I could get up and sing in front of her, Mrs. Merkowski, the half-deaf music teacher wasn't going to be a problem. And she wasn't, and I rocked. - We bow to you. - As well you should. - So, when do you hear? - Callbacks are Tuesday. It's between me, Sari Enfield, and Tyrone Fredricks. Melanie: Oh, Ty's good. Yeah, but he played the lead in "The Prime Of Miss Jean Brody" last year, so they've got to go with fresh blood this time. Get it, don't get it, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that I am now officially fabulous. ( Frankie and Cozette chatter ) Okay. Excuse me a sec. Hey there, sailor. Doing a little sketch, are you? Working on a mural for the studio. A mural. So Diego Rivera. Fanny told me if I was gonna sit here every day, I had to do something. It was this or tights. Well, personally, I'd vote for both. Hey, Frankie, you know what I was thinking today after my audition? I was thinking, you and me, we should hang. - Huh? - You know, hang. Do some hanging. Of your pictures. Which I... I bet need to be hung. Um... I'm not warmed up. - What the hell? - Shut up. Wow. That was awkward. Like white shorts in a rainstorm awkward. But here is the bright spot. Frankie actually loves awkward. He thrives on it. It's comfortable that he has a problem with. So you've just made some serious headway. - Why are you talking to me? - Oh, I was just... I didn't ask your opinion. I didn't ask you to come over here and I don't know what gave you the impression that I did. - I was just trying... - Don't. Don't try anything. Go take your massive wardrobe and your "oh so cool" attitude, and find another person to bother. Hey, Heidi? It doesn't really matter to me whether we're friends or not, but just to clarify, my family is tight. Zappa tight. So if you want a chance with the brother, you're gonna have to be cool with me. Sorry. I just think if I go he won't wait. Long-distance relationships can be hard. I had a boyfriend who was in the Peace Corps. We were together for two weeks before he left, and then he was gone for a year. You're kidding. And I was completely faithful. How? It was very difficult. I watched a lot of "Little House On The Prairie" reruns, if you know what I mean. Oh, sure. And when he came back, he had a beard and dirty fingernails. And he drank this tea that smelled like cigarettes and I just found him completely disgusting. Plus, he had married one of the villagers, so complete waste of time. Hey, I made high tea with scones and clotted cream. I want one. - Here. - What are you doing? I don't know, but it's not going to include a pantsuit.
