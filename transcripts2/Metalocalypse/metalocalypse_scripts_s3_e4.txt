You wanted me to remind you about your Christmas special meeting with Dick Knubbler? Wait a minute? Christmas special? What the hell is that? I toId you all about it. I tried to invoIve you. You passed. Another half baked Murderface project. Probably won't get past the front door. Run by Murderface, a failure with a bad track record. You know what? You guys can't be a part of my Christmas special ha ha! You know why? Because you all lack something very very important. And I'm talking about the fuckin' Christmas spirit. Actually that's kind of badass. Fuckin' Christmas spirit. Like a fuckin' ghost who kills children. Hey!! That's perfect for my special. Can I use that? No! oh come on! No. If you use it I kill you. Uhh, Murderface, you uhh still have this meeting, now. Still. Now. Still. Now. These Christmas specials can be incredibly lucrative. I've been talking about this with Dethklok for years but no dice. Well, hey. You know, we tried. And we might not have Dethklok but we got someone who's practically in Dethklok. You. I am in Dethklok. Hey, c'mon. What the fuck? I'm a fuckin' star! Yes you are! There's the attitude. That's what I'm talking about. Now listen... and wait till you hear my ideas for this thing!!! No. I'm telling you William this is gonna have to come from me. You simply cannot be invoIved creatively. It's a no go. okay, babe? What the fuck are you talking about? Well, okay, here's a brief list of, you know, failures to start out with. oh my failures. Alright, let's start out with this one. Number oneh Murderface's Titty Time Car Wash. I stand by that idea. Hot chicks wash your car. Made zero money and a series of law suits. I never touched those fuckin' girls! No the lawsuits weren't against the girls they were from the drivers for vehicle damage. Alright number two... how about the Murderface Planet Piss CoIogne? What about it? Huge failure! The FDA found traces of urine in every single bottle and people broke out into painful, irreversible skin-damaging rashes. That's the point!!! My piss is in every bottle! What don't you get? And finally we got the William Murderface home pyrotechnics kit. I still say that's fuckin' brilliant. Well there you go. You get the idea. So here's the deal, captain. I run the show. I tell you what to do. You show up. You hit your mark and read the cue cards and do what I say orrrrr- no dice. What you mean we cants do secret Santas! Toki, how many times do we have to go over this? We don't thinks it ams metals to be nice to each others. And I fuckins do! Toki, why don't you drop it? You're driving us fuckin' crazy. I aints listens to you no more! I am going shoppings! Yes! Shoppins! To buy each and every ones of yous a gifts!! And I wants to sees de Iooks on all your fat fuckin faces whens i gives you greats presents! Ha ha! Fucks you! I don't believe I've ever been spoken to like that before. Listen, for some reason the judge has taken pity on you. I wouldn't have. But they're letting you out with a slap on the wrist. What do you say about that? I'm k-k-k-sorry. Dr. Rockzo want outta this place. Dr. Rockzo gonna get his shit together. Dr. Rockzo don't like Johnny Law Iooking down his nose at Dr. Rockzo. It's k-k-k-humiliating. A k-k-k-cocaine. Alright, alright, alright. As your parole officer, I'll be checking in on you regularly alright? What are you doing? oh! oh! Nothing! Nothing! I'm listening baby, I'm just listening to you. Are you snorting my coffee sweetener? M-maybe. Sorry, go on. Stop Iooking at me. Keep talking. Is there anybody you can call to help you out? I tried to call my friend T-T-Toki, but he wouldn't answer his c-c-c-calls. I'll try. I'll try again. Alright, then first and foremost you're going to have to concentrate on getting a job. Anything, man. I'll do anything. I've got to get out of this jail. K-k-k... the world is so different since Dr. Rockso been in the Iock up. oh k-k-k-Iook at all of these plastic people.
