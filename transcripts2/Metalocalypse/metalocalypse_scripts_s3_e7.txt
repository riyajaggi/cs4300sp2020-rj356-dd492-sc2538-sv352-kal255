 REPORTER: Today's case is being called the music trial of the decade. Dethklok versus Dethklok. And it's made its way here to the Supreme Court. William Murderface and Toki Wartooth have taken Explosion, Pickles and Skwigelf to war over songwriting residuals -- the backend profits on all their records. LAWYER: Your honor, my clients make up two fifths of the highest selling Death Metal band of all time. Yet they are being treated like second class citizens.

 Good people of the court, we believe we need to be treated fairly and have an equal five way split on all songwriting residuals. Hey, whats ams residuals?? Ugh, Toki. We're at the Supreme Court and you ask that now? Look, they're like little things that mean you get paid lots of money for writing songs like those guys. Buts we don't even write songs. Hows can we gets regiskuals? Toki shut up! Why are you sitting on their side! We're suing them!

 Uhhhhh, your honor? Please strike my stupid idiot bandmate's comments from the record. He's, uh, Norwegian and he doesn't have a great command of the language. Hey, Murderface. We not gonna wins. I already tolds you! Why ams we askins for requipicles when we aints songs writers? People of the court, these guys are total dildos. This is a waste of court time! Perhaps I can help us all to put an end to this. Mr. Murderface and Mr. Wartooth do not contribute on a writing level so they do not receive writers credit, residuals, etc. I've submitted all contracts signed by them that show this. That's bullshit! They do however get a 2% back-end on record sales. I don't have to tell you folks that in this business, with this band that is a great deal of money at the end of the fiscal year. They're multi-billionaires. Case closed! Picture time, fuck you. You two over there you back there. Hey Jim, fuck you, too. This isn't faiiiiiiiirrrrrrrr!!! ? Doodily ding dong tick-tock ? ?

I'll just not sleep for a few days as usual. Yeah, but first let's eat, okay? Guys, looks like you're working real hard. That's great. Your DethJet to France is now pre-boarding. These fucking guys. It takes twice as long to record with them in the fucking room. We gotsta satisfy dere egos just so we can undoes everything and tricks them into thinkings they plays on the record. Just so they turn around and fucking sue us. At least we can enjoy some wine in France. TOKl: Wells, how ams we supposed to know its cost 150 bucks just to get in? Nobody tolds me that. I fucking knew it. You fly all the way fucking to France just to not go to a fucking wine tasting because you're too fucking cheap. Well I can't rationalize spending that kind of money. Not now, not with the way the economy is. We'll wait outside. So both of you are just gonna sit here and wait outside the entire time? What else are we gonna do? Go ahead, go in. Have fun. We'll be out here, not having any fun... standing. Ughhhhh. Fine, c'mon. C'mon. I'm paying for you. - Pickles... don't. - C'mon. I don't wanna hear it. Oh, thanks, Pickle! Hey buddy, you sure about this? Don't talk to me anymore. Just go inside. I just want to make sure it's okay. You're doing this for you...right? Go inside. Are you sure? Get inside! (gibberish) (gibberish) NATHAN: Hey. Wake up fuckers. Wake up. Pay attention. No, look at me. Listen, we can't take your bullshit anymore. We can't fucking handle it. We've given you a lot of chances and you know what? We're kicking you out of the band! MURDERFACE: They can't kick us out of the band, can they? CFO: Yes they can. It's a majority rule situation here. Think of it this way. You're on suspension. A month long suspension, and if at the end of this term, everyone feels the same way, we'll go through with your departure, divide up the assets, etc. But for now, you will live here but you guys are both on musical suspension. You mean like I'm a fucking badass cop who just took things too far? Sure. Whatever. And now I gotta turn in my gun and badge? Well. Yes. Actually. That's kinda cool, man. Gotta admit. In all seriousness I would like you to turn in your instruments and your Dethklok Badge. I don't have a fucking Dethklok badge. You were given one at one point. Look, is there any way we can turn this thing around and just kick them out of the band and sue them or something? Look, your problems are money related. And you're being accused of not pulling your weight. The obvious solution is for you to focus more on contributing when you're needed and if you need to make money on the side while you're on suspension there may be a way to do that too. Man, fuck that contributing mumbo jumbo crap, what'd you say about making money on the side? ? (indistinct rapping) ? ? ? That's was outstandings! You has de whole package and great songs. I can't believes yous guys ams unsigned. If I hads a labels I'd totally signs yous!!! Toki! I've got it! How do we make money? Not do any work? And reap all the publishing?

Fuck all of you, we're moving on and look at you all -- still working on the same old tired Dethklok shit! Desperately trying to hold on to that dream. Where are you guys getting all the money to start your label? None of your business. Are you using your own money? (grunts) You're not actually using your own money, are you? Ahhh man, you're lucky I'm on suspension or I'd answer that. Here are your sleeping quarters, my good men. No need to tip, everything's been taken care of courtesy of the label.

Something like that usually takes about a year and a half! Maybe because there ams nobodys cloggings up de process.

In the meantime, tell your boss Toki we need another advance, muthafucker. Well, It's been a month and you've completed your musical separation. And now it's time to make a decision. Nathan, Skwisgaar, Pickles -- you wrote, recorded and deleted 47 tracks of music and completely missed your deadline. Toki and Murderface-- you started a label, produced, wrote, and recorded an entire record but today's the day. You're either in or you're out of the band. Gentlemen, the choice is yours. Help me. I'm drowning here. I just want them out of my life. I want my life back. Just help me. I was cleaning puke and- Just help me out. Just do something. Come on man. I just want my life back! Murderface, you're a piece of shit. But we need you back. You see, we're too good without you. That kinda sucks dick. Give him whatever he wants. And, uh, Toki... ya know whatever. It's making news all around the world! Dethklok for the first time in years is allowing a band to open up for them! And who is this band? From new metal label Murdertooth Records comes Get Thee Hence. Their CD debuts the night of the show. What a push for this brand-new unknown band! Toki! We did it! I never thought it would, but all this hard work is actually paying off! Ohs yeah babes! And we're finally gonna clean up on the back-end because we own all the fucking publishing! Actually you don't own anything. Sorry to inform you boys, but all publishing goes to my clients. But-but-but how?! We did all the paperwork! Didn't we Toki? Yeah, I dids all the paperworks myself. You filled everything out in Norwegian, idiot. That means you get nothing. Yo, Sorry dudes. That's business. Know what I'm sayin? ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen please welcome Murdertooth recording artists Get Thee Hence! Yo yo yo. What up, what up! We are the Get Thee Hence!! Know what I'm sayin, yyeeeeeeah!
