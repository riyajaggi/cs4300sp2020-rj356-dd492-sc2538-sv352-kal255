 Translate: Shuter KEVIN: The whole business, gone. Thanks to your brother. It was all over A Current Affair. Did you see it? (Ah, no. We don't... we don't get it over here, Dad.) Well, cameras were chasing him down the street while he was trying to be a smart arse. (Actually, Dad, I'm just at work.) Why are you whispering? (I'm not whispering.) Are you still in the bin? (Dad, I've gotta go.) I've gotta go. Can't you... Crystal! Piss off!

 Sean... There he is! Hey, Dad. Wow. Look at you. Yeah, started to look after myself. Yeah, I can tell. Come on. 30 years building a company, three months for your brother to run it into the ground. Your mother and I should never have taken that holiday. Where's the car? Didn't drive. What, so we're going to walk home? And then I hit the sewerage line. That's put us back a couple of months. How much further do you think it is, Dad? Hmm? How much further? Ahh... Maybe we should have taken that last right.

 (He's asleep.) (Oh, great. Thanks.) (We should probably get going.) (OK.) (It was great to finally meet him.) (Yeah.) MAKEPEACE: (Glad you could pop by.) (See you.) Call off the search party! Shhh! (Baby cries) Hi. Hey, Dan, welcome back, man. Hey, mate. Merry Christmas. You, too. Wow, you guys look, ah... Where are you... Oh, we've got this, um, party. I know this jeweller in the city. It's sort of this big networking thing for people in the fashion biz. Wow, that's exciting. Um, going as friends. Dan! I'll see you later... Joseph. Jesus. Jesus? He's a baby in the nativity scenes, isn't he? Yeah, we're doing a whole different take on it. The baby's there. I'm there. Alright, well, I'll see you. Cora? Are you going to see us tomorrow? Ah, probably not. I've got family stuff on. Dinner. You can still stay for lunch. Yeah, yeah, come over. Come on. No-one does Christmas like us. Yeah, I know. I've been to the last three. Have you? Yeah. Three? Three. No! Yeah. Were you at the one where Dan got arrested? You weren't at that one. Yeah, I was there. That was like six years ago. See you, mate. Doesn't seem like that at all. Alright, see you, mate. See you, Jesus. Thank me for that later. I'm not even going to ask. Ah, Cooper needs a new nappy. Yeah? So? And he's your son. You were holding him. You know the rules. Well, Dan was holding him. Doesn't look like it. Come on, bro time. Well... See you, buddy. See you soon! Come on. Um, so Cora's... Yeah, Cora. That's my Christmas present to you, by the way. Merry How is that a Christmas present, Sean? Well... Yeah, Dad hasn't finished the pool yet. Mm-hmm. He hit a... Sewerage line, yep. Yeah. Yeah, he did. So she just rocked up on your doorstep? Yeah. 'Said, this is Cooper. You're his dad.' What'd you say? 'Who are you?' Classy. Well, mate, they were the S Moody Air days, you know? No, no, not really. Mate, it was a goldmine of lonely housewives.
