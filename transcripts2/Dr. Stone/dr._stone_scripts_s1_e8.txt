 [KASEKI] Someone from outside the village? Hmmm. I'm positive it's some criminal we banished a long time ago! I would bet my next meal on it! [KUJAKU chuckles] Maybe the statue people have started moving. [AZURA laughs] [AZURA] No way! [KOKUYO] So somebody tried to bring in an outsider. Surely that wouldn't have been Kohaku, would it? We're not quite sure yet.

 No, it was definitely her. Your hunch is correct. Now, Jasper, you heard what Ginro told us earlier. There's no need to lie to save her skin. Why must my daughter be so foolish? Is she trying to be disowned now? She can't keep breaking the rules! Damn it! [gasps, coughs] [KOKUYO] Ruri! [RURI coughing] [CHROME] All right, Senku! What do we need to do to make that medicine?! We gotta help Ruri kick her sickness! If we can help my sister feel better, I'm ready to do whatever it takes!

 [MAN A] Priestess Ruri! [WOMAN A] I'm so worried. --[RURI] Yay! Yay! Yay...! --[MAN A] Her sickness is cured! --[RURI] Yay! Yay! Yay...! --[WOMAN B] Science rules! [MAN B] I'm gonna join the Kingdom of Science! Do you see that? That sleazy glint in his eye tells me he wants to save Ruri for his own reasons. I still can't decide if he's a gentleman or a slimeball. But at the very least, I'm glad that he thinks things through. [SENKU] The first project of the Kingdom of Science is making an antibiotic. A wonder drug that'll kill the hostile bacteria infecting our patient. Since its discovery in the early 20th century, it's saved hundreds of millions of lives. We can't do any blood tests, and we have no idea what she's actually suffering from, but I'm sure it's still worth trying anyway. Yeah! Now let's get to work, Senku! What do we need? Well, we're missing basically everything. So pay attention, would ya? There are two routes to making antibiotics. The biological route: Creating penicillin from living things. Or the stone route: Creating "sulfa drugs" from rocks. [KOHAKU] Wait just a minute. Living things? Rocks? How could you cure somebody with those? Penicillin, which is made from green mold, is more well known. But now, in the Stone World, I think that would mean we'd have to play a crazy game of chance. We'd be all, like, "Woo-hoo! We just happened to find this specific crazy-strong mold that's ten billion times more powerful than the normal stuff!" Woo-hoo! [SENKU] We'll just have to get on our knees and pray. "Please, Lord, send down some of that special green mold! Thanks!" If we take the stone route and make sulfa drugs, we'll need a ton of diligence and manpower. But even in this primitive world, I know we can make it happen. Odds are ten billion to one we'll nail the cure. Then what are we waiting for? Let's take the stone route! [SENKU] You get the position we're in, don't you? None of us are gods or even geniuses, to be honest. We have to do this step by step. And like they say, we've gotta crawl before we can walk. [SENKU] All right, the stone route it is! We'll get each item one by one. And though it seems slow, we'll be warping straight through two million years of scientific progress. This is the scientific road map, and if we follow it, we'll reach our cure. [KOHAKU gasping] Whoa, man. That's bad! Well, guess this "iron" stuff is first! I don't even know what that is! There's so much for me to learn! Iron's not particularly easy to get. Professor Senku's science class. Or is it really sorcery? Ugh, I feel like I'm already behind. [CHROME] Seriously? Bad! You're telling me that it's actually the planet that's moving? Yeah, it's not a lie. [KOHAKU] That doesn't make any sense. I mean, if that's really the case, then why am I not flying off this branch? That's because of a little thing that we call "gravity." You know, I always thought it was weird how only just one star stays in the same place. That's the North Star. It's ridiculously useful for navigating 'cause it's ten billion percent true north. So try to remember that. Oh. I didn't know. If you want my opinion, that looks just slightly off from true north. No. Impossible. The margin of error is-- [gasps] The Earth's axis has shifted! The whole planet has been tilting little by little over the past 3,700 years. And now, in the year 5379, the freaking North Star isn't north! [SENKU] No wonder my stone-age GPS didn't get us all the way to Hakone. [chuckles] A more experienced scientist would've laughed at me. Kind of a major oversight on my part. You guys are more observant because you don't have the same preconceived notions. Bonehead move there, Senku. Heh. Just sounds like a little mistake. There's no reason to be so hard on yourself, you know. I'm not trying to put myself down. I take pride in being rational and able to deal with facts, but I still get lost in the sheer scale of everything. I feel like it's just hitting me now how long 3,700 years really is. Wait. How did she know the former North Star, wasn't exactly north anymore? Oh, no way! You mean to tell me that even the great Senku doesn't know about this rock? I just so happened to find this bad boy on top of that bald mountain one day. If you dangle it or make it float in water, this thing always points true north! Pretty nuts, isn't it? [gasps] A magnet. Man! Of course you know! [SENKU chuckles] You've done an excellent job, Chrome. Now we've got magnets. [CHROME] Woo-hoo! Check it out! Mine picked up a buncha that stuff! Look at this crazy black sand. [SENKU] Taking baby steps, but we're on the road to the Kingdom of Science. The curtain's rising on the iron age. Now that gets me excited. [SENKU] Is everyone in your village like the lioness, or is she in a class all her own? We seem to have more than our fair share of big, brawny apes, but I'd say she's more like a nimble gorilla. I am not like a gorilla! By the way, why am I the only one who's doing any work here? The two of you need to get off your asses now! We barely have enough manpower as it is! [BOTH] Sorry, ma'am. It's gonna take all day with just the three of us working. Should I get someone from the village to help out? As far as those people are concerned, you guys are just a couple of suspicious sorcerers. So I don't think anyone is dying to lend us a hand with this. [groans] [splashing] [SENKU] Uhh... Is that a watermelon? [CHROME, SENKU yelp] [KOHAKU] Oh, it's Suika. What are you doing in the water? Did you just follow us down here or something? [SENKU] Doesn't her name mean "watermelon"? [CHROME] Pretty sure it's just a nickname. Probably 'cause she's always wearing that watermelon rind. Huh?! What the hell?! I can't believe you'd just steal my magnet like this! [gasps] Iron sand. [SUIKA] I'm sorry. I just wanna help you guys. It's kinda hard to be very useful to anyone because I've got this thing on my head. Too bad. I'll wear it my whole life. But if you need some help, I'll do whatever I can! [SENKU] Yeah, yeah, I get it, Suika. [gasps] [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] I appreciate the assistance. The Kingdom of Science needs all the help we can get. We won't turn anybody away. [SENKU] Besides, a shrimpy little thing like you would be ten billion times better at gathering sand. [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] We're counting on you. [SUIKA] He's the first person I've met who didn't ask me why I'm wearing this on my head. He probably just thought I didn't want anybody to see my face and was being polite by not asking. You just met him, but I'm sure you'll figure it out soon enough. He is not polite. He doesn't give a crap what you look like, only if you're useful. It's just his way. [SUIKA] I'm gonna grab every last piece of black sand in here! Blub-blub, blub-blub! You're not Momotaro! Just try not to drown! [SENKU] Never heard of Dragon Quest or Monster Hunter , but you know Momotaro ? Who taught you that? Whoa. You know Momotaro ? That's weird. Ruri told us a whole bunch of stories like his. Come to think of it, I wonder how you guys would know about gorillas. They're not native to Japan. I've never actually seen one in real life. Yeah, but I think there's a gorilla in Momotaro . That right? [SENKU] No, there isn't! He used those millet dumplings to make new friends. A bear, a lion, a gorilla, and an alligator. Momotaro isn't a wild-ass, savage hero! I wonder if that story was just an easy way to teach the kids about dangerous animals. My sister must've told me hundreds of stories when we were growing up together. And she loves big words. I suppose that means I got all my bigger words from Ruri. [SENKU] Is that so? The plot thickens. [chuckles] I gotta admit, I'm getting low-key interested in this Ruri chick. And now, I'm that much more determined to make this medicine and cure whatever's going on with her. What the heck do you mean by that? Interested? Like, how? [SENKU] Huh? [KOHAKU] Senku, hey. Psst, Senku! He thinks no one knows, but Chrome's got a major crush on Ruri. Ahh. So that's what that was all about. Right. Great. Cool. And Chrome's totally like a little kid about the whole thing. He's so oblivious it's almost kinda cute. What're you guys talking about over there?! Did you just say I'm like a kid?! [SUIKA] You're saying the black sand we got outta the river turns into this "iron" stuff? It will. You mix four parts of the sand to one part coal and bake it. Got it. That sounds pretty easy to me. The bad news is it's way harder than it sounds. Nothing at all like baking little clay pots. That'll be our next problem to solve. Wood can burn up to 700 degrees but iron-making requires much higher temperatures. We're talking 1,500 degrees or more. So how are we gonna get it that hot? Is it even possible? We gotta blow like hell! We provide it with as much oxygen as we can, so we're gonna need to send in a crazy amount of air, and hope that it increases the fire's damage points from 700 to 1,500. This thing blows air? With a handy little item like this, I can probably do it all by myself. Try it out and get back to me on that. The truth is, we'll never have enough manpower. [ALL screaming] [screaming] [CHROME] Holy hell, it feels like my arms are gonna fall off! Don't you dare give up and let it get cold! [KOHAKU] How many more minutes do you think it'll take?! Let's see, maybe 20 to 30 more hours! [ALL] Iron-making is bad! Don't push it, Suika! Take a break if you need! [SUIKA] I'm trying so hard, but I'm still useless. [GINRO] It looks like they're doing something super intense up there! Hey. Uh. I'm gonna go help. No way, Ginro. Don't abandon your post. The rules are the rules. Aw, come on. That's easy to say when you had a golden spear made for you. I want one. No fair. That's not it! You shouldn't worry about trivial possessions! Well, why don't we trade spears? No deal. I should have silver, but I'll settle for gold if that's how it's gotta be! [KINRO] I said no! Our top priority is more manpower. The Kingdom of Science needs a population boom. Spear of... silver. [SENKU chuckles] He took the bait, and we'll be reeling him in before you know it. Oh, yeah. It's all startin' to come together. We'll get more manpower. [BOTH] We'll tempt them with science. You guys are starting to sound really creepy. The fact is, we can't entice everyone in the village with shiny new spears. We need to know what they want. It's time for us to plan an intel mission. [SUIKA] I'm really good at that kind of thing! Because I can turn into a watermelon! I'm an expert snoop! [CHROME] Whoa. [chuckles] Now that's impressive! Okay, Great Detective Suika's on the case. We're counting on you to find out what the people want. Yeah! You've got this, Great Detective Suika! [SUIKA] "Great Detective Suika"? I'm finally gonna be useful! [VILLAGERS chattering] [CARBO] I heard Kohaku tried to bring in an outsider. Does anybody know if they were able to get in, or where they are now? Supposedly, he's living in Chrome's shed! But I haven't seen anything for myself! The elder believes that we should let the man be-- that he's no threat as long as he doesn't try to come into the village. Yes, I agree. Perfectly reasonable. Indeed. But if he tries any monkey business... [MAGMA] I'll kill anyone who threatens our village! Ah, yeah! Then Ruri will see how manly I am! Oh, yeah! Well, if this outsider guy is strong, then color me interested. That's all I care about. Yeah, see, I don't really care if he's strong or not. But if the guy's handsome, then I might wanna meet him. I don't need a man to be handsome, or a big pile of muscles. I just want a good provider! It's crazy. We're three beautiful sisters with different tastes in men. I don't understand why we're all still single! Oh, I've gotta say, this grilled fish is so delicious! Yeah, I'm so glad we eat this every day! I'm so sick of fish! It's like, all we ever eat! [SUIKA] I went around the village all day and I found out what most people want. First off, here's what the sparkly sisters Garnet, Sapphire, and Ruby had to say. Oh, boy, they're the most beautiful girls in the village. They were talking about what they want more than anything. I really hope that it's something we can create with our limited available technology. They want boyfriends! There's no chance in hell we're making one of those! A man who's strong. Handsome. Someone who can feed me! Well, at least they're all being honest about what they're looking for. Heh. You're not bad-looking, Senku. And you do have a certain kinda charm about you. But I don't think you're the type of handsome that Sapphire's really talking about. Aw, girls are always flappin' their jaws about what they want in a man. It gets really freakin' old. And that's precisely the reason why I can't stand any of 'em. Then you're lucky you're a child and not a man. Since Ruri and I are women, I guess you can't stand us? Oh, give me a break, you know I never thought of you as a woman. You're a gorilla. [CHROME] I'm sorry, ma'am. The girl who wants food could work for me. She might be our only shot. What does she want? [SUIKA] A big feast with game and stuff! Oh! That reminds me of something. I overheard Gan'en, the village glutton. He was complaining to his parents that he's bored to death of eating fish all the time. So all he really wants is to try something new. [chuckles] [BOTH] Uh? I knew that you could pull it off, Great Detective Suika. Thanks to your intelligence- gathering skills, now I know what kind of science we can use to win them over to our side. So are you gonna cook for them or something? But what does cooking have to do with science? Everything, actually. Food is science, after all. I mean, do you think the umami quality of the grilled fish you eat every day is just some kind of random accident? No, it's glutamic and inosinic acids. [CHALK growls, barks] [SUIKA laughing] Suika, what're you playing with over there? Oh, this? Check it out. It's my widdle buddy Chalk's favorite toy ever. Dogtail millet! [SENKU] You mean foxtail millet? Ya know, that could actually be just the thing we're looking for. We might be able take that stuff and make a ridiculously tasty dish. Something that everyone in my old world used to drool over. [yells] [barking] We'll make primitive, gourmet survival food from scratch. Now that's exciting! [KOHAKU] We're really gonna eat this? Because foxtail millet is super gross. So... you can count me out, Senku. The reason we're whacking the hell out of it is to remove the husk so we can eat it. Foxtail millet is ten billion percent a grain. Albeit an unrefined one, but still. [KOHAKU] Ugh. It looks so nasty. And it's completely covered in furry stuff. [SENKU] It's a cycle of inspiration followed by experimentation. When you think about it, food is a perfect example of science. We have flour. It's not wheat, but it'll have to do. Way to go, guys! Let's crack in a few wild bird eggs, and then add in a dash of potassium carbonate to give it some elasticity. It's a dish of science accidentally discovered by some unknown Mongol around the fourth century. That's right, he was probably a crazy nut that would literally try anything, just like you. Way back in fourth-century Mongolia. [BOTH] Uh! It smells so good. [SENKU] And of course, we had a name for this stupidly yummy bowl of science 3,700 years ago. We called it "ramen." Okay, but that is yucky foxtail millet in there. Ugh. I'll make sure it's safe for us to eat! Because one of a sorcerer's most important qualities is to not be afraid of anything different and new! [CHROME] It's amazing! Ramen is bad! [SUIKA] It's so slurpy! I've never had anything like it! [KOHAKU] I didn't know such a tasty thing existed! --[ALL crying] --[SENKU laughs] [SENKU] I might as well dig in, too. It's been 3,700 years since I've had a proper bowl of ramen. [SENKU] And that is not it. What did I expect from foxtail millet? The texture is all sandy and crumbly, and the aftertaste is horribly bitter. Maybe if you think of it as medicine, it's edible. Then again, these people probably think it's the food of the gods. And that means it's gonna work. Foxtail millet ramen for the win! [music playing] Huh? The hell's goin' on? Oh, man, something smells amazing! [SENKU] People have waged wars over salt and pepper. That's how fundamental food is to civilization. With the raw power of ramen on my side, soon I'll have complete control over this village! You look and sound like a bad guy right now.
