 [ALL screeching] [SENKU chuckling] [SENKU] It's finally starting to look like a place fit for an actual human. Okay. To be honest, I don't think I can keep hitting "ignore" on my exhaustion for too much longer. [SENKU] Damn. I had no idea it was this hard to keep just one person alive. There's no time for scientific progress. What I wouldn't give to have someone with brute strength

 and stamina to handle the grunt work. [SENKU] I've got a hunch about this one. It's close to where I broke free, so it's highly probable that we drifted from approximately the same location. These crazy-strong hands are just what I need. [sighs] [chuckles] [SENKU] Although I do get a little sick of looking at his stupid face, I think 3,700 years may've been enough of a break. Hey, ya big oaf. All right, time to get started on Senku Lab's first project. So tell me, meathead,

 what'll it take to get you to wake up like I did? [SENKU] Maybe the bigger question is, what exactly was it that turned all of humanity to stone 3,700 years ago? Hypothesis number one... [ALIEN A] Dude, earthlings are so lame. Let's turn 'em into stone. [ALIEN B] It did work on those pesky swallows! Petri-ray! [ALIEN A] Ha! Get excited! [SENKU] Hypothesis number two... Ha-ha! The petrification doom-ray is finally ready! [TAIJU screaming] What in tarnation? It got us as well! [SENKU] Hypothesis number three... [ALL laughing] We're the petricoccus virus! Only humans and swallows are vulnerable to our power! He-he! Get excited! [TAIJU screaming] [SENKU] The only thing I'm sure of, is whatever caused this targeted humans and swallows specifically. It seems like fantasy, but in reality, there's an underlying rule. Which means I can solve it. Discovering these hidden rules is what science is all about. [SENKU] Right now, I'm starting down a new path. An uncharted branch of science. Get excited, Senku. [SENKU] What did it? What caused me to break out of my petrified state? Was it simple deterioration? If that were the case, the outside surface exposed to the elements would be the first to break down. But the petrified people are like statues, stone all the way through. For me, it was like a shell, the outside was stone, and the inside changed back to living cells. [gasps] [SENKU] It's the other way around! The surface was deteriorated and couldn't revert to the living cells. It became a stone husk! The parts of the surface that were less petrified turned back to cells. That's why that reconstructed shell has holes in it. [SENKU] So I wasn't revived due to deterioration or erosion. There's some outside X factor in play. The fragments ended up in a pile, with the ones closest to my head on the bottom. Which means the revival started at the top. [SENKU] There's gotta be something in there. [SENKU] Smells like nitric acid. That's it! [SENKU] The back of my neck is still petrified. [SENKU] Time for a quick experiment. --[crack] --[gasps] [chuckles] Huh? [grumbles] [SENKU] Why did nitric acid only work on me? It's not making one millimeter of progress on Taiju or anyone else. There's gotta be an answer. What makes me different? [SENKU] Think. I just need a working hypothesis. Come on, Senku, think! [gasps] [SENKU] That's it! I was thinking! For the entire 3,700 years I was petrified, I remained conscious. The human brain burns through 400 calories a day. Over 3,700 years, that works out to two terajoules of energy. But where did all that energy come from? E equals mc squared. Energy and mass have equivalent exchange. Old Man Einstein expressed a basic scientific truth with that equation. It tells us that we can't create energy from nothing. There's something in the stone itself that I was consuming. That's how I had the energy to use my brain. Finding out what that was is the key to undoing the petrification. I gotta try everything. Every experiment I can think of. I'd love to get my hands on some kind of industrial-strength etching agent, like nital. Ugh. But I need alcohol to make that. Gotta believe. And try, try, try. Keep trying everything I can possibly think of. And then try some more. [SENKU] Never forget. Petrification may seem like a fantasy... ...but the foundations of science are rock solid. [SENKU] I need manpower! Take some of this nitric acid and get up already! Hear me, blockhead? You're awake inside there, aren't ya? You've been awake for this entire damn time! You and I are no different in that regard! You don't know when to give up either! Hey, Senku! Come on! Taiju. [BOTH] I'll wait for you however long it takes! Because I can't do this without you! So please come back, Taiju! Please, come back! Please, Senku! The storm. It's over. [SENKU] That thunderstorm was providing some serious cover for us, so keep your voices down from here on out. Because if Tsukasa hears us, it's game over for real. [TAIJU] You're right! [YUZURIHA] He's not coming, is he? [BOTH gasp] [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Good job noticing the thing with my neck. I barely even gave you any real hints about it. Taiju, Yuzuriha, I believe that kind of thinking should snag you ten billion points. Senku? Senku! [SENKU screams] That killer tried to painlessly sever my spine, but you'd crush my whole body? Let go! You know I'm not the type of guy who does the whole "emotional, teary-eyed gratitude" kinda thing, so don't expect that. Yeah. Welcome back, Senku. [TAIJU] Hm? [YUZURIHA] What do you think? Does that look like a rocket ship to you? There's a buncha stars, too! [SENKU] Yeah, no. I'm not seein' it. [YUZURIHA] It's a "science flag," and I think it's perfect for you, Senku! It can even help your neck! Great idea! And now you have a splint, see? Ten-billion percent sure I don't need this. I'm perfectly fine, okay? Professor Senku volunteered his body and the experiment was a great success. The restorative effects of de-petrification are really incredible. [laughs] First we thought turning to stone ruined everyone's lives, but I guess it kinda saved yours this time, huh? It's like what you were saying when we made soap. The de-petrification, it's a lifesaver in a time without doctors. It's Doctor Stone! [SENKU] Yeah. Come to think of it, it is pretty odd. When the petrification is undone, the affected area is rejuvenated. It's an extremely beneficial scientific phenomenon. I've been wondering this whole time, "Who petrified humanity? What force was behind the attack?" But... was it even an attack at all? Seeing as it was able to fix Senku's neck, maybe if we piece these statues back together and pour the revival fluid on them, they'll come back whole again. [SENKU] I tried that fairly early on. They ended up turning into dismembered corpses. There has to be some reason why it doesn't work. [SENKU] Yuzuriha. Taiju is ten billion percent too crude to pull it off, but you're our super-skilled crafts club member. This is gonna be a grueling mission. You up for it? [inaudible] Uh. [whimpers] That really, really sounds like an extremely grueling mission, but I'll do it! [SENKU chuckles] Well, that was an easy sell. Crafting's about perseverance! Hey! Are you telling secrets? No fair! Don't keep it from me! I, uh... I was saying that maybe you and I should go meet up with Tsukasa! Well, there's an idea! Go see Tsukasa, eh? Say what?! Are you crazy?! You mean the same homicidal maniac that killed Senku?! I mean, Senku's alive, and Tsukasa used to be a good dude! But still, we all thought he had killed Senku, and I'm sure he probably thinks he did! And that is exactly the advantage we gained in that little fight. [TAIJU] Huh? [SENKU] Listen, Tsukasa thinks I'm rotting in hell right now. I, on the other hand, know his whereabouts in the real world. We can have a major advantage in this war if the two of you can infiltrate the "Tsukasa Empire" and act as our spies. [TAIJU gasps] [SENKU] I gave her the details of the mission you'll be undertaking. Taiju, your main objective is to protect Yuzuriha. With a blockhead like you, the less you know, the better. I got it, Senku. Loud and clear. [SENKU] Tsukasa's planning on using the miracle fluid to build an army of the young and able-bodied. He'll create a brutal world ruled by the strongest, with him at the top of it all. In order to bring down his empire and stop the so-called "purification," which is really just mass murder, we'll create our own rebel army, using science as our primary weapon. But how are you gonna pull that off, Senku? You'll be alone. She's right. If we're both gone, and Tsukasa's got control of the miracle water, you can't make gunpowder, or more revival fluid to wake up some allies. [SENKU] Huh? Even for you, the answer should be obvious. I'm going to find whoever sent up those smoke signals and convince them to join our side. I just hope they don't end up running into Tsukasa first, because that could be a problem. I'll have to assume they haven't, and leave it at that. [TAIJU] So, going forward, the two of us will be spies inside the Tsukasa Empire. And you'll be recruiting for the rebel science army. We'll each be fighting our own battles. [SENKU] Tch. That's the idea. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Better get going before we start to cry. [YUZURIHA] You guys are pretty casual about the whole thing. But I guess boys tend to be kinda stoic, huh? It's true. And Senku is a super logical dude. We won't be seeing each other for a little while. Who knows if it'll be weeks, or a couple of months, or maybe even... [TAIJU] Senku! I promise! [TAIJU] Wait, I shouldn't be shouting like this. [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Just hang in there until our paths cross again, ya big oaf. We already had to wait 3,700 years to see each other. A few more months, or even years, is no big deal. Time is relative, ya know. [SENKU] But no matter how long it takes, we will build our kingdom of science. Fifty-seven meters behind me to the right. Yeah. I know that you've been shadowing me for the last two minutes. So tell me who you are. [TSUKASA] Blue eyes. And she's young. Did Taiju and Yuzuriha revive her just now? Or did she come from somewhere else? [giggles] [yells] Not too friendly, are you? What's wrong with "Hello" or, I don't know, "Nice to meet you?" [GIRL] Shut your mouth. You can save that for who you meet in hell. [GIRL yells] [TSUKASA] It's impossible to be this young and this skilled. If she'd been in the martial arts community, I would've heard of her. Who is she? I saw everything you did! You took that girl hostage, and when that gentleman gave himself up to save her, you just killed him on the spot! I couldn't tell what you were talking about, but whatever your story is, don't waste it on me! Beg forgiveness from the sorcerer gentleman until your evil soul fades away! [gasps] What sorcerer? Huh. He just covered you with his magic, and you don't remember? The mysterious black powder that summoned forth the mighty mountain's rage! [TSUKASA] The mountain's rage? Does she mean the explosion? [TSUKASA] Ah. So you aren't one of the revived. But maybe a child of someone who was? Is that it? Or perhaps... What generation are you? [TSUKASA] I think she's from a primitive tribe with no concept of science. I could easily rule over them, or just kill them if I choose to. There's no reason to attack at this point. Huh. So my immediate goal is to return to that cave. Taiju and Yuzuriha were taught how to make gunpowder. I need to claim that miracle fluid before they do. This is goodbye. [gasps] It's you. The sorcerer gentleman who was protecting that girl. You're alive! [SENKU] You need to stop talking. We can introduce ourselves later until we're blue in the face. But now, it's a waste of energy! Tch. Do you think you can make it until nightfall? If you feel like you're dying, we could risk blasting the tree with the gunpowder I have left. But if you hang in there, I'm ten billion percent sure I can save you. It'll just take some time. You're the only one who can make that call, so what's it gonna be? You gotta tell me right now! Yeah. My bones and organs are fine. I can hold on! [SENKU] I'd guess the fallen tree weighs roughly one ton. To move it to the side should take half that, so 500 kilograms. My weight of 60 kilograms, multiplied by two to the third power, should get me to 500. Three of these will do the trick. [SENKU] Bamboo's barely strong enough. I'll pack 'em with dirt to fortify 'em. [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] A little soap will come in handy yet again. This is an all-star team of Professor Senku's greatest inventions, working together. What in the world are you doing? This is called science! This particular device was invented by Old Man Archimedes a few hundred years B.C. And it can make a skinny, high-school nerd like me as strong as Hercules! The compound pulley! [GIRL] Amazing. [SENKU] Hm? [GIRL] And I'm not talking about the wisdom of Archi-whatever. What I mean, is how you kept going through every single step until you solved the problem. Your perseverance is amazing. Guess it's time to introduce myself. My name is Kohaku. And honestly, I believe I've taken quite a liking to you. [giggles]
