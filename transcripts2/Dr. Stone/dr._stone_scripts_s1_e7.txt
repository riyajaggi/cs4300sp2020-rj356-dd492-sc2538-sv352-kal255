 [KOHAKU] Amazing. [SENKU] Hm? Guess it's time to introduce myself. My name is Kohaku. And honestly, I believe I've taken quite a liking to you. [giggles] [SENKU] Ugh. I can't say that I can give one millimeter of support for what I just heard. We've just met, and you're already professing your love? Not how to handle an emergency.

 I didn't say anything about falling in love! I'm saying I like you as a person and I think the two of us can work together! [SENKU] Oh. Well, thanks. I appreciate that. 'Cause nothing's as illogical or prone to trouble as a romantic entanglement. [SENKU] Hm? What are you, a new species of hominid that sleeps with a weapon or something? Makes it obvious I don't have love on the brain. Look, I may be curious about your ways, but I'm not sure how much I can trust you yet. Besides, it's a force of habit, because I watch out for myself, so don't take it personally.

 [SENKU] I'm not enough of a hero to attack a lioness like you, so quit wasting time and get some rest. [KOHAKU] "Lioness"? I am a person! With feelings! You might've seemed like a gentleman at first, but you're actually kinda rude, ya know that? I'm afraid I might accidentally end up killing you. If you just go to sleep, there won't be any accidents. I'm not too keen on the idea of dying twice in one day. [KOHAKU] You're fighting against that long-haired man, aren't you? I'll help you with that. I'm not the type to just run away with my tail between my legs. [SENKU] Yeah. That's why I'm setting out to build a kingdom of science. But what I need... is manpower first. Oh, yeah? So you're lookin' for allies, are ya? Well, then why don't you come along with me? So you've got some more lion buddies? There a whole pride of you somewhere? [KOHAKU] That's right. I'm sure they would be great allies for the battle. Especially one guy in particular. I'll lead you to 'em, Senku. You just gotta follow me. [SENKU] Hot spring water? [KOHAKU] Yeah. I'm taking it back home for a bath. It's good for the healing process. Why do you need to take a healing bath when you're obviously, like, ten billion percent healthy? The thought of an overpowered lion girl like you running around is kinda terrifying. I am not a lion! And for your information, it's for my sister! Honestly, carrying this big, heavy thing of water is a lot of trouble to go through. But she's been especially sick for way too long now. Sometimes I feel kinda guilty for being so healthy. If only we could switch bodies once in a while. Looks to me like that jar probably holds a bit less than 50 liters. Doesn't seem like enough to fill a bathtub. I wonder how often you have to lug that heavy-ass thing back and forth. A few times a day, right? [KOHAKU] Heh. I've made it a part of my daily training. Thanks to these trips, I'm a lot stronger. I know I was complaining earlier, but honestly, I'm pretty grateful tha- [SENKU] In case you've forgotten, you had a tree fall on you yesterday. I don't want you to over-exert yourself and die on me, so hand it over. Thanks, Senku. [thudding] I'd over-exert myself, huh? [SENKU] Am I the only one in this Stone World who's not practically a gorilla? I mean, Taiju, Tsukasa, and now you? [KOHAKU] "Gorilla"? Okay, I actually prefer "lioness" to that! [SENKU] That's not... the point here. Whoa! How in the heck did you build such a useful thing so quickly? It wasn't really that quick. I just had some materials ready from making that pulley yesterday. Progress gives rise to progress, and applying that to further civilization is science. [KOHAKU] Turn right up here! We missed the turn! Look, Senku. Check it out! [groaning] [gasps] We're here, so welcome to my village. [SENKU] How many people live here? [KOHAKU] Well, not counting the kids and retirees, there are 40 of us, all working together. More than 40 of you? [SENKU] Kohaku and the others don't appear to have any knowledge of modern technology. So I'll bet that means they're descendants of people who revived a long time ago. Which means there was a first generation at some point. Maybe even hundreds of years ago. I wonder if there was a man of science, like me, who was able to come up with an earlier version of the revival fluid. But there's really no sign of that, or evidence of any kind of scientific advancement passed down through the generations. Where did all these people come from? [gasps] There's no need for all of that, Kinro and Ginro. This man saved my life yesterday. Great news. But you should know better. Can't break the rules. Under no circumstances are we allowed to let outsiders enter the village. The chief will be angry with you. There's no use in arguing about it. The rules are the rules. People from outside the village aren't welcome. Because they're all criminals, or were banished by the chief. Therefore, we cannot let him cross this bridge. Even if he saved your life, we can't make any exceptions. [KOHAKU] Oh, yeah? Then you leave us no other choice. We'll just have to battle it out right here and now. But it's really not fair. There's two of you and one of me. Should put me at a major disadvantage. [GINRO chuckles nervously] [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] I really did walk in to the lions' den. Heh. You're all growling and snarling at each other. Sorcery! [BOTH gasp] [gasps] [GINRO] What's happening? How come there's all these mysterious floating jewels in the sky? Wow. So that's their level, eh? [chuckles] Well, I guess this is gonna be no problem at all. I'm gonna get every last one of them on my side with science. Nothing like having brains and a small army on your side. It's time to get excited. You sound pretty creepy right now. Maybe don't get ahead of yourself? This doesn't seem to be helping at all! When I stab 'em, they multiply! Okay, then. There's no other choice! Special Technique: "Let someone else handle it"! Hey, Chrome, help! It's sorcery! [CHROME] Yeah, yeah. Would ya quit freakin' out, Ginro? I'm one step ahead of you, as usual. I spotted them from the beach. So of course I ran here as fast as I could. Hey! I'm the one called Chrome! Bad and insanely smart. I'm the genius sorcerer of the village! [KOHAKU] Ha. Looks like we won't have to track him down, Senku. This is the guy I mentioned yesterday. Ah. So he's a "sorcerer," now is he? My name's Senku. And I'm a scientist. I know you're scared 'cause you're not as smart as me, but don't let his cheap trickery get to you! These things are super easy to create! All you need is charcoal, ash, and boiling water. I wasn't scared of them. But you'd be a fool not to be cautious of the unknown. I actually was pretty scared, to be honest. We don't need you here, Chrome. I'm not dumb enough to believe that your dubious sorcery would help us. Believe what you want. I don't care. But know this! I'm not backing down! 'Cause sorcery is my specialty! So step off and let me handle this guy! If we fight right here, there's a chance some of the villagers could get hurt. Let's move it somewhere else. [laughs] [GINRO whimpers] [GINRO] What does a sorcery battle even look like? Ah! They aren't gonna start shooting fireballs and burn us alive are they? Please stop! At least don't do anything dangerous! I don't wanna die! [laughing] All right. Ready for some badass sorcery? Check out my Rainbow Bridge! I am the master of the flames and fire! [GINRO] Whoa! He did it! He made the fire turn yellow! [GINRO] It changed again. It's greenish blue! And now it's purple? Wow. It's crazy! Sorcery. "Rainbow Bridge"? What total crap. They're reactions to basic flame tests. You threw salt, copper, and some sulfur into the fire, in that order. So, the copper... is it copper sulfate? He wouldn't know that. Did you use some blue crystals? Maybe you found them in the caves? [CHROME] Oh, shit! How in the hell would a total outsider like him know about the blue crystals? He must be able to read my mind or something! No way! Is that his kind of sorcery? I didn't even know that was possible! "Oh, no, I'm so scared, I gotta run away now!" That's what I thought would happen. "You've defeated me. Please allow me to be your apprentice," was another possibility. I mean, one or the other, but not like this! I was actually kinda worried what my plan would be if he had asked to become my apprentice. Uh. Hey. I'll have you know that my sorcery is definitely not just completely made up of little tricks and cheap crap like that. [KOHAKU] I didn't say anything. [CHROME] Oh, you wait and see. I'm gonna get one of my instruments of sorcery that will put the hurt on you for sure! It's a legit weapon! Wonder what he's got in there. Must be why we moved the battle. To be near his "instruments of sorcery." [grunting] [CHROME panting] Ow! That hurts! What the hell did you do to me? [CHROME chuckles] A sulfur ball. You took some of the same stuff you threw on the fire earlier and put it in an urn. You melted it down, let it cool and harden, and then broke the urn around it. Neat way to make one of these. A sulfur ball static generator. Originally invented back in the 17th century. I'm starting to get pretty excited about you. Heh. But rubbing it with leather instead of your hands will make ten billion times more power. I'll use my science flag. Holy crap! That's so bad! The guy's hair is all spiky! It was already pretty spiky. [KOHAKU] Oh, wow. How does that work? [chuckles] [gasps] [GINRO] Ohh... [CHROME] Hey, give it back! Feels like I'm watchin' "baby's first science class" with this dude. It's all so primitive. [SENKU] Chrome, did you think up all this stuff by yourself in this backwards little village? All these minerals and scientific materials, you took it upon yourself to gather and collect them in that shed? You bet I did! Why do you care? It's normal for kids to find stuff and keep it. Smash it all together, mix it up, burn it. And when something really crazy happens, that's what you call sorcery. Think about it, what else could it be? [SENKU] Tch. [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Check it out, Tsukasa. You can kill me, or anyone else with a brain for that matter. You can try all you want to kill science itself, but there will always be some idiot who'll try anything just to see what happens. Eventually the shiny monkeys will create a technological civilization. Listen, the way things are going right now, I'm ten billion percent sure that you're exactly the type of person that Tsukasa is gonna kill. And the only way for you to survive is if you join our kingdom of science. [CHROME] Who's Tsukasa? What are you talking about? [SENKU cackling] [SENKU] I would love if you joined forces with us, and lent your shed of science to the cause! Hey! You're not taking my stuff, okay?! [CHROME] Damn it, I look like an idiot. I can't back down now. I challenge you to one last battle! Just you and me! If you lose, you'll leave the village after you bow to me! If you win, take everything in the shed and I'll work for you! You sure? [CHROME] I'll show you things you've never seen, because I'm the greatest of all time! Arithmetic! Fight me in a battle of numbers! I have a strong feeling that Senku is about to wipe the floor with you. [CHROME yelps] I'm super excited about this! [chuckles] Oh, man. How many years did it take you to collect all this amazing stuff you're keeping in here? Totally awesome, don't you think? You kicked my butt-- uh, well, only because I was off my game-- but my collection could never be beat! [KOHAKU] It's all just a bunch of stupid rocks. Malachite! Chalcanthite! And corundum! So bad and insanely tough! I can't tell any difference between them. How can the two of you get so excited over a couple of rocks, anyway? I can't believe you've got galena! Lead has been acquired! That one's super shiny when you break it open! Sorry, but I'll never understand why they think these things are so cool just because they collect them. I used to collect bugs when I was a little kid. But now they totally creep me out. [SENKU] You even have cinnabar in here?! I hope you have fun showing off the most boring trophies ever. I gotta bring this hot spring water up to my sister. [SENKU] Cinnabar. Sometimes called the philosopher's stone, and a handy item in Dragon Quest . If you heat it up, you'll get mercury. There they go with all their creepy sorcery. Do as you like outside the village. But take one step on this bridge and I'll cut you down. The rules are the rules. Now, just melt some gold dust into the mercury. [grunts] You'd better not inhale the smoke. You'll die. But this shiny golden spear is pretty awesome, isn't it? Whoa! That is bad! And what good will this sorcery do me? Heh. There's really no practical advantage to it. But your name does mean "gold," so a golden spear is perfect for you. Your bribe won't work. Give me all of the shiny objects you want, but I still won't break the rules for you. Nuts. Kinro's a stick in the mud. Practically all the guy ever says is "The rules are the rules." [KINRO] 'Cause it's true. Rules are rules. [KINRO] That being said, I think I'll just keep it like it is now. [SENKU laughs] All he needs is one more push. Hey, so, what about a silver spear? [SENKU] You're like one of those people who plays Monster Hunter , but only so they can collect raw materials. [CHROME] Monster Hunter ? [SENKU] You have a lot of plants, too. Felwort, sweetroot, canker root. All traditional medicines. They're drugs, basically. Yeah. But I have no clue if they work or not. I try them on myself, and I keep the ones I think are good. I'm hoping that I'll find something that'll heal Ruri. In fact, that's why I became a sorcerer in the first place. [RURI] I'm grateful to you for bringing me the healing water from the hot springs. It truly helps. Thank you. We expected you yesterday. Did something happen? Heh. I accidentally fell asleep on the way back home. So I just spent the night in the forest. [TURQUOISE] "Accidentally?" Give me a break. You need to start taking your duties a lot more seriously. [RURI] Jasper, Turquoise. Do you mind giving us a moment, please? I'd like to speak to Kohaku in private. Please, forgive us, Ruri. We're not allowed to leave the priestess by herself. But Kohaku is my own flesh and blood, so please... You dummy, Kohaku! Your hair is knotted differently. Something must've happened to you that caused your hair to come undone. Ah! Ruri! [RURI coughing] I beg you. Please be careful. I don't have much time left. Don't risk your life for me. [CHROME] Senku, whether it's called sorcery or science, can we save her? Well, that depends on her condition, you know. But things are more difficult in this Stone World. [SENKU] All right, Chrome. I think it's time I told you everything. About what happened 3,700 years ago, and about what the world was like before the collapse. [inaudible] Why the hell did you start crying all of a sudden? Didn't expect you to get emotional. [CHROME] I'm not crying! Aw, damnit, I am crying! Who turned everyone to stone? If I find out, I'll kill whoever it was! How could we lose it? All the people that came before us spent millions of years building up civilization. One that was full of science, and technology, and life! And it all just got wiped out in a flash? How in the hell could that not piss me off? [SENKU chuckles] It hasn't been wiped out, you moron. It's all still right here. [CHROME] What do you mean? [SENKU] Humanity isn't going down that easy. We've got two million years of human history as close as it could be. Right here inside my head. [SENKU] And it's inside you, too. Am I wrong? No, you're not wrong. You couldn't be more right. Senku, I'm gonna build this kingdom of science with you! And we're gonna fight whatever it is that's making Ruri sick! So tell me, are you really up for it? Using science to find a way to cure her? Heh. Yeah. We're gonna use science to make the ultimate medicine. You and I will make antibiotics!
