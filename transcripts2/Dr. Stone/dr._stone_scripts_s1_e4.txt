 [SENKU] Shishio Tsukasa is an awesome guy. Who happens to be a murderer. [chuckles] If we can make some weapons of science before he realizes what we're really up to, then victory is ours. But if he gets wise to us? Game over. The race is on, you guys! The gun. We're gonna make some gunpowder. Time to get excited, you guys. [gasps]

 [TSUKASA] Hakone. If they make gunpowder, I don't stand a chance. Senku can do it. So I have to stop him before that happens. [banging] [chuckling] Yuzuriha. I think I should tell you about what happened while we were turned to stone. On that day, long ago, when I had asked you to come and meet me over at the camphor tree... [TAIJU] It's like this, Yuzuriha. I've kept this inside me for five years, and--

 [YUZURIHA] Well, Taiju? You wanted to tell me something back then. What was it? [TAIJU] Yuzuriha, for the entire time I was a statue, all I thought about was finishing what I started to say. For hundreds of years, thousands of years... But things have changed. And now, in this crazy Stone World with nowhere to run to, I just wouldn't feel right as a man to tell you what I was going to say back then. [TAIJU] I-I'm sorry! I realize that this is all super vague and confusing and you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. [YUZURIHA] No. I'm pretty sure I do. It's up to us to bring back civilization. But once we've saved humanity... When that's been done, will you let me say it then, what I wanted to say 3,700 years ago? Will you please? Yeah. It's okay. We are gonna bring the world back. I'm sure of it. [SENKU laughs] We have the three components we need to make gunpowder. For real? We got all of 'em already? The only thing left is to mix it up. It's time for a gunpowder cooking class that'll be a total blast! [SENKU] Gunpowder ingredient number one is sulfur, which there's plenty of at this hot spring! Number two: Charcoal. And we can get as much of it as we want just by burning wood. As for number three, it's not as easy to come by, but we need potassium nitrate. It takes a hell of a long time to whip up a batch, so... Ta-dah! I took the liberty of making a bunch of it beforehand to save us some precious time! [TAIJU screams] [TAIJU] Hmm... Nitrate sounds familiar. I feel like I've heard it before. Nitric acid! Miracle fluid! Did you get that stuff outta the cave? Surprisingly enough, you're right for once, simpleton. You get ten billion points for that. So now, we'll blend our potassium nitrate in with the sulfur and charcoal. Let's sweeten the mixture by throwing in a pinch of sugar to give it a little more oomph. A bit of this glucose I extracted from grapes should do the trick. What's up, guys? My name is Mecha-Senku. That recipe we just put together is the real deal. Meaning it can actually create a bomb! So don't try this at home! Finally, pound it down till it's packed solid! --[TAIJU grunts] --[cracking] Need a poundin', bro? 'Cause that sounds like the perfect kinda job for me! [YUZURIHA, SENKU scream] Are you sure that's a good idea? I'm scared if you use all your strength, you could make it spark and go boom! Like with flint! Yeah, no. Hitting stone with stone doesn't actually create any sparks. Oh. I didn't know that. Hey. You're right. That's because flint is not your ordinary type of stone. The metal in it is what makes the spark. Hot springs... volcanoes... iron pyrite... Iron pyrite? [SENKU] Wai-- [yells] [ALL scream] [BOTH gasp] [SENKU screams] No problem, you guys! This just proves our gunpowder cooking was successful! That's scary stuff. We need to be careful! Yeah. It's been involved in a lot of experiments gone wrong. Not uncommon for some curious kid to lose a limb or worse. [YUZURIHA] Huh? Don't forget, this is a lethal substance we're dealing with. And we're planning to use it against Tsukasa? No. We'll make a deal. [TAIJU] Huh? Tsukasa isn't some sort of random, mindless murderer. Think back. When you two had your scuffle, you remember what he said? Let me make sure I understand you. You'll let me pummel you as much as I like so I stop breaking those statues. That's what you're saying, right? Yeah, exactly! I don't understand. You aren't making any kind of deal. [SENKU] In other words, under the right circumstances, we can negotiate with him. And with a little gunpowder on our side, we'll have leverage. [SENKU] However, if the negotiations don't work out in the end, then we'll have to... [TSUKASA] I know what Senku's doing. If he's already successfully made the gunpowder, then I'll have to... [BOTH] ...kill him. [TAIJU] All right, just a little more and it'll be out. [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] If Tsukasa's after us, there's a ten billion percent chance that he'll find us. [gasps] [YUZURIHA] Hey, Senku, Taiju. --[SENKU] Hm? --[TAIJU] Huh? [SENKU] A smoke signal? Is it Tsukasa? [SENKU] No, he's in the opposite direction. And besides, he's got absolutely no reason to reveal his location like that. So what then? A forest fire? I don't believe it's a mere coincidence. The timing suggests it's a response to the smoke we created. [YUZURIHA] You mean...? Indeed I do. [SENKU] It's time to get excited you two. Because it looks like we've found someone else in this Stone World. Whoa. There's more people? We're not alone? Don't you think we should finish putting out the fire? Yeah, you're right! [SENKU] No, hang on. As far as they know, our smoke could've been caused naturally by a small volcanic explosion. We need to send a signal back before they decide to give up and leave. I think it get it now! Are you sure? Won't Tsukasa be able to see it, too? We'll be broadcasting our location to everyone, including him. [TAIJU growls] [chuckles] [SENKU] The least logical part of me, what some might call "my gut," is talking. Lighting the fire is risky. I have to choose between safety and our future. What do we do, Senku? Put it out? Or light it? [SENKU growls] Let's light it up! Fire the smoke signal! We're running outta gunpowder! Grab anything that'll burn and throw it in! All right, I'm gonna go get some firewood! [SENKU] This is a double-edged sword. We're telling anybody within sight exactly where we are. And if Tsukasa's figured out that we're making gunpowder... [TSUKASA] Senku is definitely making gunpowder. That bit about the shells tipped me off. Check it out. There are four super useful things you can do with it. I said three earlier, didn't I? [TSUKASA] Senku hid one big piece of info from me because he realized I was a potential threat. Which means... The fourth useful thing you can do with seashells is craft some kind of weapon. I can guess what that is. Producing potassium nitrate for use in making gunpowder. [TSUKASA] There they are! From early on, Senku knew he'd need something more advanced to fight me. [YUZURIHA gasps] [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] When one uses science to create a weapon, that's when the "strongest" man is no longer the most powerful. I'd say you're looking especially grumpy today. Tsukasa. Yeah. I suppose that is an accurate way of putting it. If you go down this road of developing weapons and start reviving older generations, they'll begin fighting over established interests, and then we'll be right back in a tainted world. I don't mind getting my hands dirty, if that's what it takes to stop that from happening. And by that, you mean killing Senku the Science Man, right? [chuckles] I'm sure the whole world would be moved to tears by your merciful death sentence. But before that, would you mind giving me the recipe for the revival fluid? [growls] Nope, sorry. I guess I'm not as kind as you are. I can only look at things as being logical or illogical. So, I don't care one millimeter what you do with that girl. There are plenty of other females to revive. [gasps] [gasps] [TSUKASA] Don't try to negotiate, Senku. [TSUKASA sighs] [TSUKASA] You never buried Yuzuriha, like you should've. Your best move would've been to take her while she was still covered in stone and put her deep in the ground somewhere. In a place I couldn't find her. And if I thought of that, there's no chance in hell it never crossed your mind. But for some reason, you didn't do it. Was it for Taiju's sake, or for Yuzuriha's? No. I think it was for both of them. [gasps] [growls] [TSUKASA] You call yourself logical, but you have your precious friends to care for. I always had tons of admirers, but there's no one I'd truly say is precious to me. And because of that... this is my win. [YUZURIHA chuckles] [YUZURIHA] I really appreciate the haircut. It'll be a lot easier to care for in this world. [YUZURIHA] Please, don't give him the recipe, Senku. As long as he doesn't know how to make it himself, he'll have no choice but to let you live. He can't kill you. I'm not important at all. But you? You have to survive, for everybody's sake. To make sure they have a future. [chuckles] [SENKU] The revival fluid is a combination of nitric acid and alcohol. First, you gotta filter the miracle fluid from the cave, then mix it up with alcohol that's been distilled to as close as 96% as you can get it. The ratio is 30% miracle fluid to 70% alcohol, and if you're off by just a few points, the reaction won't happen. So you should fine-tune it by testing it on a petrified swallow feather. Thank you so much, Senku. And now, I no longer have any reason to let you live. Good. I think this should be enough. [gasping] [screams] Now there's three smoke signals! [TAIJU] They must be responding to the three shots we fired with the gunpowder. There's no doubt about it. We're not the only ones here! Senku! Yuzuriha! [WOMAN] Three. Let's say I did let you live, right? You would develop civilization just like before. Can you promise that you won't do that? [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] The hell are you talking about? I could promise anything to stay alive. No. You would never lie. Not when it comes to science. So will you promise me, here and now, and for all eternity, that you'll abandon science? Because if you can make that pledge, you can live, and then I won't be forced into killing you. [TEACHER A] All right, next up is Senku. I'm going to space. [CLASSMATES] Huh? So an astronaut, then? That's an excellent dream, young man. Work hard, and when you grow up--- No. I'm going there as soon as possible. [SENKU chuckles] Then again, I'm just a kid who doesn't know the first thing about science. [SENKU] I'm gonna need to study. Every last thing. I'm gonna try everything. [gasps] [SENKU'S FATHER] I can't help you all that much. But if you're serious, I firmly believe that you can accomplish anything through the diligent application of science. [SENKU'S FATHER] I've got a feeling that this Christmas, Santa Claus will give you all the tools you'll need. [SENKU] Hm? [gasps] So you can burn things with the point of light from a magnifying glass. What an adorable little scientist. [SENKU laughs] Iron sand and aluminum foil are awesome! The thermite reaction is melting the frying pan. Not sure that's adorable. The liquid oxygen for the injector boils off at ten billion percent at a normal temperature, but freezes when too cold. I'll keep trying with ethanol for now until I switch to kerosene. [ALL] Huh? [ALL chuckle] [SENKU] Huh? [TAIJU] Huh? [SENKU screams] [yelling] [STUDENT C] Huh? [SENKU screaming] [STUDENT C] Huh? [STUDENTS screaming] [TAIJU] Hey, what's that? This thing's an ablator. It keeps the chamber from burning up. [BOTH screaming] [TAIJU] Just a few things, sir. A raspberry Pi, and a transmitter module, and something called a "gyro." [TAIJU] Huh? [TAIJU] Huh? For the receiver, we'll use a Yagi antenna. Like on an old TV. Whoa! [TAIJU] Yo, Senku! Didn't you say you wanted to test it out with a light payload? Well, I got some help from Ogawa Yuzuriha. Check it out. She used her crafts club skills and made us these. [YUZURIHA] To be honest, it's actually kinda embarrassing to have a doll of myself. So what are you gonna do with these guys anyway? [panting] Exploded at high altitude. We failed again? [SENKU] Heh. No, not entirely. [BOTH gasp] [SENKU] I'm going to space. As soon as possible. [SENKU] You can accomplish anything... ...through the diligent application of science. Senku, you know that I'd rather not kill you. I'll ask again. Will you promise me, right here and now, that you'll give up on science? No, I can't. I can't do that. Of course not. I knew that would be your answer. [SENKU chuckles] Now don't go givin' me that crap. No matter what I said, we both know that you were gonna kill me at some point. You'd find a reason. [TSUKASA] Maybe. Just kill me in one blow. Because leaving me to suffer till I die is both illogical and inefficient. Don't worry, Senku. I'm going to sever your cervical nerve. It'll be instantaneous. You'll be knocked unconscious and die without suffering. I won't miss. [gasps] [YUZURIHA] Taiju. Something's wrong. I gotta get back, now! Senku, I have a feeling that if we had met each other 3,700 years ago, before all this, before the planet was turned into a Stone World... ...I think that you might've been my first real friend. Maybe. [yelling] Senku!
