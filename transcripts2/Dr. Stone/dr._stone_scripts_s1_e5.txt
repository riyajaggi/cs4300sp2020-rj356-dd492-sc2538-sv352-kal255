 Let's say I did let you live, right? You would develop civilization just like before. Can you promise that you won't do that? [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] The hell are you talking about? I could promise anything to stay alive. No. You would never lie. Not when it comes to science. So will you promise me, here and now, and for all eternity, that you'll abandon science? Because if you can make that pledge, you can live.

 And then I won't be forced into killing you. No, I can't. I can't do that. Of course not. I knew that would be your answer. Just kill me in one blow. Because leaving me to suffer till I die is both illogical and inefficient. Don't worry, Senku. I'm going to sever your cervical nerve. It'll be instantaneous. You'll be knocked unconscious and die without suffering. I won't miss. [gasps] [YUZURIHA] Taiju. [TAIJU gasps]

 Something's wrong. I gotta get back, now! [TSUKASA] Senku, I have a feeling that if we had met each other 3,700 years ago... [ALL] Huh? [ALL chuckling] [SENKU, TAIJU] Huh? [SENKU screams] [yelling] [TSUKASA] ...before all this... ...before the planet was turned into a Stone World... [TSUKASA] ...I think that you might have been my first real friend. [thud, squelching] [TAIJU screaming] Senku! [TAIJU screams] Senku! Please! Answer me, Senku! Open your eyes! Wake up and say something! C'mon. This can't be right. There's no way! Don't let it end like this, Senku. After everything you've done, you can't just die! Talk to me! I gave him a painless death. It's over. I trust that as his friends, you will give him a proper burial. [gasps] [TSUKASA] Even if Taiju wasn't a pacifist, he'd never risk endangering Yuzuriha by attacking me. That was the power dynamic between us. But, Taiju, if Senku's death sends you into a rage and drives you to attack me mindlessly... ...then I'll have to kill you, too. Please, don't lose your head. What're you doing? [TAIJU] It's fine, Yuzuriha. Don't worry. I'm still thinking clearly. [TSUKASA] Of course. I have no choice but to fight. Sorry, Yuzuriha. But I can only hope-- [YUZURIHA] No. It's okay, Taiju. After all, the three of us made each other a promise. It'll all work out. There's no doubt in my mind. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Yuzuriha. [TAIJU grunting] [TAIJU screaming] [TSUKASA] Overhead? Why? [TSUKASA] It must be a decoy. Good try, but I won't fall for it, Taiju. No matter what you do, you've lost. [TAIJU] Tsukasa's worried I'll attack him. He won't dare take his eyes off me! And that... is why she has a chance! [YUZURIHA] Tsukasa thinks I'm Taiju's weakness. Someone he has to protect. And in a primitive, stone world like this one, it makes sense. [YUZURIHA] But it's like Senku told us... [YUZURIHA, TAIJU] Science levels the playing field for everyone! [TSUKASA] That's black powder! [YUZURIHA] Senku didn't leave us with nothing! [TAIJU] We have science to remember him by! The three of us made a promise to work together and stop you! [TAIJU] Me, Yuzuriha, and Senku as well... ...we're fighting this battle together! Goodbye, Tsukasa! [TSUKASA] Taiju would never attack anyone. Knowing that, I think he must've expected me to come out of this unscathed. [TAIJU] Goodby, Tsukasa! [TSUKASA] So that's what he meant. It's gonna be okay, Senku. You said it yourself, remember? If we're gonna run for it, then we have to do it together! I don't care what anyone says-- you're not dying on me! I know you're alive! We've only just started bringing back civilization, and you're not the kind of guy to leave a job half done! [TSUKASA] What's the point of fleeing? [TSUKASA] I know for a fact that I severed his cervical nerve. [TSUKASA] There's no coming back from that. Especially not in a Stone World that has no medicine. [TAIJU] I'm trying to give him a heart massage, but I have no idea if I'm doing it right. But I can't do nothing, and this is all I can think of. [TAIJU] Wait! What about mouth to mouth? Ah! Hold on a second! I think we need to keep his neck still! Because that's where Tsukasa hit him. I'd been caught, and Senku gave himself up for me. Wait, you're saying he sacrificed himself? [STUDENT A] Check out this psychology quiz. "There's been a tragic accident, and between your friend, your lover, and yourself only one of you can be saved." Who would you choose? Uhh. I think I'd get stuck picking between my friend and my lover. [STUDENT A] Might pick yourself in the heat of the moment. How could anyone make that choice?! This quiz of yours seems kinda nasty. I choose everyone. [ALL gasp] [SENKU] I'd look for a fundamental rule... ...that'd let me save all of us. [YUZURIHA] Guess that's the kind of answer you'd expect from the Science Club's president. [TAIJU] That's actually an option? Well, it's my choice, too, then! [STUDENT A] I think the point of the question is more to reveal who's most important to you. [SENKU] That's ten billion percent obvious. Your book belongs in the trash. [TAIJU] Senku wouldn't go the suicide route. He wouldn't sacrifice anyone. He would stake the whole game on the chance to save us all. We have to figure out what he was thinking. If anyone can do it, then it should be his friends! He must've left us a hint! His neck. Back at the hot spring, when I was caught, Senku was drawing attention to his neck. I think that's where he wanted Tsukasa to strike him. [TAIJU] You're right. That thing he was doing, it's not a habit he always had. Why'd he keep touching his neck and cracking it? Was he trying to tell us something? [gasps] [YUZURIHA] There's a little bit of stone left on his neck! Hold on. When we removed the stone that was left on your foot, Senku told us something. That when we "de-petrified," cracks were filled in as part of the process. Here, Taiju! The revival fluid! [TAIJU] Right. [YUZURIHA] It might work on Senku's neck, too! There's a chance. Yeah, when he's de-petrified, his neck might be fixed as well. The petrification's gone! [screams] Wake up, Senku! I knew you'd live! I knew you weren't gonna let yourself be killed, not in a place like this! Senku, you're... the star of hope. For humanity. For all of civilization! So please... come back! You have to wake up, Senku! [SENKU] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Heh. All right. I can make it past 800,000 seconds without all-but losing consciousness now. Guess my brain's finally adjusting. [SENKU] I've been frozen for 117,354,889,550 seconds. [SENKU] So this is the 3,718th spring since I froze. Starting in spring is an absolute must if I wanna survive. [SENKU] Okay. No time like the present. Come on, me, get up. Get up. Get up, damn it! Get up! Get up! [SENKU breathing heavily] [chuckling] Yeah! I'm finally free! [SENKU] Yeah. A flashy entrance like that would've been fun. [chuckles] [SENKU] And I'm ten billion percent sure that's how my blockhead friend Taiju would've done it. My first objective is to evaluate my surroundings. I'll start with my own body. It can give me clues that're worth its weight in gold. [SENKU] My initial location. The position of my body. Even the order in which these mysterious stone fragments fell off me. I'm gonna keep every last piece for when I'm ready to investigate later. --[rustling] --[gasps] [MONKEYS gibbering] [MONKEY C] Yo. Where you from? Where's your monkey tribe? [grunts] [MONKEY C] Dude's all smooth and shiny! Gross! What kinda monkey has skin like that? [MONKEY A] He's got his nasty peepee out, too! [MONKEY B] Well, so do all of us, but still! [MONKEY C] Gross! Am I the first human they've seen? [SENKU] Doesn't look like civilization survived. This is a whole new world. And from the looks of things, I might be the first shiny monkey to be born in it. [chuckles] [SENKU] This is exhilarating. Get excited. [SENKU] It's been 117,354,893,870 seconds now. Huh. This is some nasty mental math. Especially when I factor in the leap years. Not to mention the earth's rotation slows by 17 millionths of a second every year. That hardly adds up to anything, though. [SENKU] April 1st, 5738 A.D. Though you could call this Year Zero. 'Cause it all begins today! Tch. [chuckles] Behold the power of the smooth and shiny monkey. My forebears had the technology to reach space, and I'll rebuild their civilization from scratch. [yelling] [MONKEY C] He's been rubbing that stick this whole time. [MONKEY B] That shiny monkey's a dumb-dumb. [MONKEY C] Let's go home. [MONKEY B] What a moron. [SENKU] I'm neither a meathead like Taiju, nor an ultra-dextrous craft club kid like Yuzuriha. There's no way I can start a fire with nothing but a primitive hand drill. Not in Japan's humidity. Heh. [SENKU] That's right. This shiny monkey has neither fangs nor claws. All I can do is improvise, one step at a time. That's how civilization advances. [screams] [MONKEY C] Why does he keep smashing rocks like that? [MONKEY B] That shiny monkey's definitely a dumb-dumb. [SENKU] There's a trick to this, but I'll only find it through trial and error. Maybe I should bash the edges off in mid-air. [SENKU] Or I could use a solid foundation, and aim right at the edge, chipping at both pieces at once. Can't forget that different stones have different uses. This colorful piece of chert is the hardest rock around. Which makes it the perfect material to craft into a knife. Study everything. Try everything. [chuckles] I can unravel this plant like string cheese. [MONKEY C] It looks like he's twisting it now. [MONKEY B] I bet you his brain is just as smooth as his skin. [SENKU] Surprisingly enough, there are quite a few animals that use tools. Crows, otters, orangutans, and more. But out of all the creatures in this world, only one can make use of science. [SENKU] When cellulose is heated through friction and exposed to air, it rapidly oxidizes, giving us... [MONKEYS scream] [SENKU] ...combustion! [SENKU screams] [growls] [MONKEY B] Huh? [SENKU] Through persistence and ingenuity, I can take everything this universe has to offer. I'm the master of science! [ALL gasping] [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Just realized I never introduced myself. It's a pleasure to meet you all. [MONKEY C] Ah! What the hell is that? [MONKEY B] The shiny monkey isn't shiny anymore! [SENKU] You see, I'm the only one of my kind still walking this world. I'm a human being. [SENKU] I intend to build a technological civilization from scratch. And this is where it all starts.
