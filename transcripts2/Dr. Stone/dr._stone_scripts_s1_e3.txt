 [TAIJU] He was called "the strongest primate high-schooler." Shishio Tsukasa. [TSUKASA] As long as we're together, the two of you will not be in danger again. From now on, I'll take care of all the fighting. But I have a nagging feeling that the new guy may be a little bit too strong. [TSUKASA] Heh. [TSUKASA] Tell me something, Senku. Are you planning to bring back

 all the greedy, black-hearted adults who ruined the world we came from? We live in the Stone World now. A paradise that hasn't been ruined by greed. I think we should only revive the young and pure-hearted, and make sure that we keep this world natural and not owned by anyone. This is our chance to purify humanity. Don't you agree with me, Senku? [SENKU] This guy's gonna be trouble. But if we hadn't woken him up right then, we would've been lion chow for sure. The situation forced our hand. Now he tells me he only wants to save the young.

 I doubt do he'll anything rash until he learns how to make his own revival potion. So no matter what, I have to stay tight-lipped about the miracle fluid in the cave. [TAIJU] Hey! Awesome news, you guys! Check this out! You see? I got a whole pot full of miracle fluid from the cave! And that means we can use this stuff to finally bring back Yuzuriha! [wheezes] [TAIJU] Huh? So what's this "miracle fluid" you're talking about? [gasps] [chuckles] [SENKU] I won't waste my breath trying to explain the science behind it. Showing you will be ten billion times faster. I hope you realize what an honor this is. You're getting to witness humanity's revival firsthand. Okay, Yuzuriha. I promised we'd save you, and it's happening for real this time. [SENKU] What the hell? For some reason, we don't have enough revival fluid for even one person. Crap! Did I really get it too soon? Just grab some more. We'll hang back and play 20 questions or something while you're gone. But do try and make it quick, would ya, big oaf? Of course! Be back before you know it! Full steam ahead! [TAIJU yelps] [TSUKASA] I'm the fastest, so it makes more sense for me to go. But I'll need to know exactly where to find this "miracle fluid." [chuckles] [SENKU] Yep, I knew he couldn't resist taking the bait. Once he finds the source of the miracle fluid and decides to keep it for himself, there's a ten billion percent chance he'll stop my plan of bringing everyone back. Tsukasa's gone, isn't he? Yeah. Like a bolt of lightning. Never seen a guy move so-- Uh! [SENKU] Let's make some revival juice! We'll bring her back A.S.A.P. Before he has a chance to return. [TSUKASA] Bats. [TSUKASA] Touching it turns my finger yellow. I see. So the miracle fluid is just nitric acid. [TAIJU] What's going on? You literally just said there wasn't enough revival fluid! Do you really believe I would set out a collection pot that was the wrong size? No, you wouldn't! Then why did you send Tsukasa out to get some more? It's a calculated risk. I wanted him gone before we revived her. Even if it meant revealing the location of the cave. Why would you want to get rid of Tsukasa? He's like totally awesome! [SENKU] That's why he's too much to handle. He wants to remake this world into a place where only the strong survive. And that kind of thinking doesn't move me one millimeter. Heh. But a civilization-building game gets me excited. Yeah, okay. No need to explain. It's cool. I trust you to make the right decision. Something happened while I was gone, huh? You're right. Shishio Tsukasa is an awesome guy. [SENKU] Who happens to be a murderer. [TAIJU] Yuzuriha. Sorry to keep you waiting, but I'm here. Just like I said. I'll help you. Did you forget that we're in a hurry, ya big oaf? [TAIJU yells] You just dumped it? We should be more like, you know! [TAIJU] Wait, why is nothing happening? Don't worry, Yuzuriha, it's fine! Is this fine, Senku? Well, the reaction isn't instantaneous. The petrification is much like cryostasis. The stone shell acts as a protective coating made from trace metals in the body. An unknown process caused them to phase shift, and they took on a petrified state. You lost me, Senku! It's so complicated! [SENKU] Tch. That's my theory at least. Based on an entire year of painstaking experiments. Anyway, my point being. If just one part is exposed to the natal and begins to break down, it initiates a chain reaction that ripples across the organism's body. And the petrification is undone. [gasps] [TAIJU] It's like this, Yuzuriha. I've kept this inside me for five years. I'm gonna tell Yuzuriha. I'm gonna survive this, even if it kills me! I was able to stay alive because of you. Sorry. But I just couldn't protect you. [TAIJU] I've loved you. For hundreds and thousands of years. Yuzuriha! Please open your eyes. That you, Taiju? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you wait 3,700 years. Forgive me. [YUZURIHA] What's going on? It's like I've been asleep forever. But still, I... I feel like you saved me. You did, right? You saved me from something. Oh, wow. Thank you. [TAIJU] It wasn't me. Senku did all the work. He spent a whole year working on that revival fluid. [SENKU] Pardon the intrusion on your big moment, but you need to make a decision before he gets back. There're only two options, so choose carefully. Plan A: The two of you run away this instant and find a new place to live. The farther the better. Plan B: We join together and fight to stop Tsukasa's murder spree, using the weapons of civilization. Come on, man! Obviously, we'll stay and fight by your side! I mean really, what kinda people do you think we are? [YUZURIHA] Mh-hm! I have no clue what's going on, but I'll help however I can! [SENKU] I'm not making any assumptions or trying to be nice. It just seems logical to give you the chance to flee. Listen, Senku! If Tsukasa is killing people, we've got no-- [TSUKASA] So I'm "killing people"? Huh. I'd say that's a matter of perspective. [BOTH gasp] [TSUKASA] I call it culling them. For the benefit of the new world. [chuckles] [SENKU] He's not even trying to hide his murderous intentions in front of them. Which means anyone who gets in his way... [gasps] [TAIJU] Senku, if things go bad, please take care of Yuzuriha. I'm gonna stop him! Right here and now! [yells] [SENKU] You pea-brained idiot! This guy killed a freakin' lion with his bare hands! You're ten billion percent screwed! [grunts] [SENKU] Now I've got no choice but to bust out my secret weapon! [TAIJU yells] [SENKU] By shooting at him now, I can at least break up their fight! [gasps] Nobody has ever taken one of my kicks full force and remained standing before. It's true, but what's even more interesting is the feeling I get that you actually refused to attack me just now. Why is that? I don't hit anyone! You can hit me or kick me or whatever the hell you wanna do! But I'm tellin' ya! You gotta stop breaking those statues! Because killing is wrong! End of story! Taiju, let me make sure I understand you. You'll let me pummel you as much as I like so I stop breaking those statues. That's what you're saying, right? Yeah! Exactly! [sighs] I don't understand. You aren't making any kind of deal. [chuckles] But if you insist on getting in my way-- I don't care how many times you wanna come at me, I'm not gonna stop trying to stop you! [TSUKASA] That girl you just revived, what if I told you I'd kill her instead? [TAIJU gasps] [YUZURIHA] I get it now. This is why Senku was telling us to run away before. [YUZURIHA] Huh? No! Taiju! Seems it did hurt him. He's bleeding like a stuck pig. He'll need a couple of days to sleep it off. Yeah. So let's not fight each other. You just protect your girlfriend and quit worrying about some random statues. Meanwhile, I will do what I need to do. [TSUKASA] Stay out of my way. That arrow I shot was moving at over 200 kilometers per hour. That's crazy. He just grabbed it. [SENKU] Nap time's over! Rise and... What're you doing? You said he needed to sleep for a few days! Give me a freakin' break! Is this it? You're just gonna lose that easily, ya big oaf? No way! Not me! Oh, wow! Are you really okay? I'm made of stronger stuff than that! And I'm still crazy-full of energy! Well, thank goodness. [gasps] We gotta stop him! Before he can murder anybody else! Wait, ya big oaf! I won't give up that easy! Don't you understand what just happened? He showed us we can't stop him with brute force! Still, we gotta do somethin'. [SENKU] In the Stone World, there's only one sure-fire path to defeating a monster. Advancing civilization, and crafting weapons of science! [cracking] Uh. That seems wasteful. The heck are you doin', Senku? Staging a scene, obviously. This way it'll look like he freaked us out so badly, we just took some food and ran off. Whaddaya mean by that? Are we really gonna give up? No, but it'll look like it. [chuckles] If we can make some weapons of science before he realizes what we're really up to, then victory is ours. But if he gets wise to us? Game over. The race is on, you guys. We're gonna hunt for materials to make weapons. Starting at Hakone! Just think of it as a big, 80-kilometer adventure! [TAIJU] That's like two full marathons. We can knock it out in five hours. [SENKU] Maybe a freak of nature like you can. [YUZURIHA] The cherry blossoms seem different somehow. Because the ones we're used to, called Prunus yedoensis, aren't self-pollinating. And that means? [SENKU] They must've gone extinct right off the bat. [TAIJU gasps] [SENKU groans] Man, what an amazing view! It's perfect. Uh. What's that thing? A scope? [SENKU] A sextant. It's been 35,970 seconds since sunrise. You just spit that number out like it was no big deal. Well, while he was a statue, he counted for hundreds of billions of seconds. So he's pretty good at it by now. A sextant is supposed to tell you your exact location based on the time. Unfortunately, this one seems to be total garbage. [sighs] [SENKU] But without GPS, this is all we've got. I'm guessing we're around Kamakura, but I'd love to know our true coordinates. Huh. Think there're still any buildings we can use as landmarks? They've all crumbled after this long. There's nothing left. Hey, is something the matter? [YUZURIHA] Isn't that--? [YUZURIHA] It looks like there's some kind of clearing in the trees up ahead! Kamakura's landmark's still standing. [laughs] Our location is 35 degrees, 19 minutes north by 139 degrees, 32 minutes east. Look, you see? Hey! What's wrong, Yuzuriha?! Did someone make you cry?! Was it me?! [YUZURIHA] I'm not crying! I mean, I am, but it's not that kind of crying, 'cause it's not anybody's fault, okay? It's just... this is a lot for me to handle. I haven't been up for a full day, and none of this feels real to me yet. But seeing the Great Buddha of Kamakura like this makes me realize that we really are in Japan, and thousands of years have passed by without us. I thought about my mom, and my dad, and everyone else. And I just... C'mon, there's nothin' to worry about. We're gonna beat Tsukasa before too long, then saving humanity is right around the corner. Senku's right, ya know! Thank the Great Buddha here for showing us the way! He's still standing strong after thousands of years, just like a god! Hm? Or like a buddha. Well, anyway, it's a true inspiration! [laughing] Well, yeah. The statue's made outta bronze. The chemical compound's resistant to corrosion. Look, though! There's no trees or plants or anything growing around the Buddha! Kinda like he wanted us to find him so he made it super easy! Well, yeah. It's leaking copper ions like crazy. And those are toxic to most kinds of vegetation. That gives me an idea, though! We'll use bronze to make mirrors. Time to give my crappy sextant an upgrade! I just need some of this, so... No, stop! Ah! That is like, so wrong! Don't hurt the Great Buddha! [SENKU] You're too superstitious! He'd want us to survive anyway! I believe in science! We need the resources, you dumb ox! Don't you wanna live? [SENKU] What the hell are you doing? Guarding us against predators. And Tsukasa might come after us, too. Sorry, man, but if the lion killer finds us, we're screwed. So stressing about him is illogical. [TAIJU] Hm? Seriously? Just go to sleep. You need rest to do your job, ya big oaf. [TAIJU yelling] [SENKU chuckles] Looks like our big water buffalo is actually struggling a little bit. Don't worry about me! I got this! There's still plenty of juice left in the ol' tank! We'll be just fine. Uh. Hey, Yuzuriha, your toe is still kinda rocky-lookin'. Yeah, I know. Not gonna lie, it's not great. But I don't want you to worry about me. But I am worried, tho-- [YUZURIHA] That's cold! Feels like the pain is finally starting to go away. [TAIJU] Whoa! Does the revival fluid have some kinda healing power, too? Though that would be amazing, it's just cracks filling in. Another part of the de-petrification process. I mean, we're still alive, even with these cracks in our faces. Yeah, that's true. So let's keep going, shall we? Soon we can soak in some real rejuvenation fluid. I just remembered something that's in Hakone! [TAIJU gasps] [TSUKASA] The room's been torn up, and there's all these footprints. Seems like they panicked and ran away. Yeah. That's exactly what they want me to believe. I'm no fool. I know Senku's not the kind of man to turn tail and run. [TSUKASA] But why would he lie about Taiju being down for the count, and then secretly head west? [TSUKASA] It's obvious. Senku's planning on using his knowledge of science to make weapons to fight me. But where'd they go? Ah! We made it to the goal, guys! Hot springs here we come! Wow. And the view of Mount Fuji is incredible! It's great, yeah. But you two better not forget the real reason that we traveled all this way. So what's this "weapon of science"? [chuckles] Oh, just one of the greatest inventions in human history. [TAIJU] Smartphones? You do love your smartphones. Wrong. The gun. We're gonna make some gunpowder. [SENKU] The stone age was two million years ago. Gunpowder was invented fairly recently, in comparison. About 700 A.D. Basically, we're gonna warp ahead 1,998,700 years. A giant leap in civilization. Time to get excited, you guys. [gasps] [TSUKASA] Hakone. If they make gunpowder, I don't stand a chance. Senku can do it. So I have to stop him before that happens. [SENKU] Lucky for us, Japan is full of volcanoes. Go to any hot spring and there's a plethora of sulfur just waiting to be taken. And that's the main component of gunpowder. [chuckles] We're about to create our ultimate weapon against Tsukasa. Some black powder should do the trick just fine.
