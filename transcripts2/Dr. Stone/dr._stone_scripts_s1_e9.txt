 [music playing] [chuckles] [VILLAGERS chattering] [GAN'EN gasps] [SENKU] This savory bowl of gourmet science... ...is gonna buy me enough manpower to make steel. Foxtail millet ramen. Coming up! [GAN'EN] I've never had anything so chewy and amazingly yummy! [chuckles] We all know Gan'en has some experience with eating, so... Man, that's tasty!

 A steaming stew of slippery deliciousness! Are you the man who made all this incredible food for us? The one called Senku? So, what kinda girls do you like? The kind that can pump a ton of oxygen into my furnace. What kind of answer is that? Really! I mean, did the concept of polite small talk not exist during your time? [CHROME] Hey, Kinro, Ginro! Don't pretend like you don't wanna try it. This ramen stuff is insanely good! [GINRO gasping] We will not eat food made with your sorcery! Besides, a guard accepting a gift

 would clearly be in violation, you know that! Rules are rules! Really? Then what have you got in your hand? I guess there's a special exception for a golden spear? Yeah, what gives, Kinro?! [VILLAGERS chattering] [JASPER] Chief, it's about your daughter. Kohaku is handing out strange food to the villagers. [KOKUYO] Say what? [JASPER] Shall we go? [KOKUYO] Why would we? To try it. You believe I would do that? [RURI] Kohaku, what are you and that outsider really up to? [SUIKA] Here you go! I've totally lost track of who I've served already! They're really eating it up. Everyone's coming to get some. Heh. They can have all they want. But they'll find out very soon that the more ramen they eat, the harder I'm gonna work 'em! You really do make the creepiest faces sometimes. Ah. This ramen is making me wickedly thirsty. A cola would be great. Cola? Senku. You happen to know that guy? [SENKU] No, I don't. [CHROME] Hey, just eat it before it gets all mushy. [KOHAKU] Kinro. Ginro. I need you to stop squabbling. How come? Is there a--? [gasps] [KOHAKU] I'll get right to the point. There's trouble. Better answer truthfully, or I'll slit your throat before you know what hit you. Are you one of the long-haired man's underlings? [chuckles] [GEN] Well, while I admittedly don't mind the attention of a cute little thing like you, I believe you must've mistaken me for somebody else. [GEN sighs] [GEN] I've not yet met any "long-haired man." I've been wandering all on my lonesome since breaking out of the stone. I thought that you looked strangely familiar somehow. You're Asagiri Gen, right? So you do know him! [SENKU] No. Never met him in my life. He's a trashy magician who wrote psychology books. Read my work, have you? How wonderful. But that "trashy magician" barb was cruel. Please, call me a "mentalist." Look, I apologize for taking the ramen without asking. So please, will you be kind and lower your weapons? My arms and legs are trembling in fear, and I'm worried I may spill this heavenly bowl. I got it! I don't mind holding it for you! [KOHAKU] He's full of crap. [GEN] I was all by myself and searching for something to eat, then my nose was filled with nostalgia. The scent of ramen. [KOHAKU] I've seen scared guys before, and he's not one. And every word outta his mouth is like feathery fluff. ...having an extremely difficult time adapting. [SENKU chuckles] Yeah, sure, I'll take your word for it, man. But still, there's no such thing as a free lunch. You and everybody else who ate the ramen have got some work to do. [screaming] [ALL screaming] We've upgraded the blowing capability! Iron furnace: Level two! We're gonna have to take turns, but I think it'll work! Question for ya, Gen. How are Taiju and Yuzuriha doing these days? [GEN] Uhh... Oh, so that's your game, yeah? Work me into a state of exhaustion and fool me into fessing up? You've got guts, trying to pull a trick like that on a renowned mentalist. [GEN] There's no need for you to worry. Taiju's strength is seemingly without end. But you know that, right, Senku? [KOHAKU] He's definitely with that long-haired man! Should I kill him? Wait, you fool. Okay, Gen. You ten billion percent knew I was trying to make you talk, so why'd you suddenly let it slip that you're working with Tsukasa? Well, because once I saw all of this, the tides turned, as they say. [GEN] I have a simple task. That is to confirm your death beyond any doubt. "Tsukasa, Senku is still alive." One little phrase, and your fate would be sealed. That was my initial plan. But if you're able to finish forging weapons made of iron, there's no telling who'd come out on top. [gasps] Whoa! [SUIKA] Wow! [GEN] "All I found was a tiny primitive village. Seems Senku is no more." One fraudulent report would spare your life. Does that sound good to you? [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Actually, it's music to my ears, and I'd really appreciate you doing that. [GEN] Don't go thinking I've got some "moral compass." I'm unbelievably shallow. Give me a life surrounded by hot girls and I'm happy as a clam. I couldn't care less if you and that primate Tsukasa live or die. I'll be on the winning side, no matter what I have to do. What benefits me most? Is it aligning with your fledgling Kingdom of Science, or perhaps Tsukasa's Empire of Strength? That is truly the extent of my concern. On one hand, there's the scientific creations and ramen and all that. But hellish, back-breaking work is just not my style. On the other hand, Tsukasa's settlement lacks science and the food is rather plain. But my work is easy. And if I revive a few hot celebs, I could have the harem of my dreams. A harem? What's that? I'm sorry. All I can say is that it's not for children. [SUIKA] Well, whatever it is, ramen is probably way better! Yeah. Ramen's nice, but on a balmy day like this, I think I'd rather side with Tsukasa and what he can provide. Asagiri Gen, was it? I think the only two options for a snake in the grass like you are either locked up or put in the ground! Scary! No. If he doesn't go back and give his report, Tsukasa will come looking for him and we'll all be screwed. [chuckles] So relax, would you? I've got a plan for this iron. And once you feast your eyes on what we're gonna make with it, there's a ten billion percent chance you'll choose to join our Kingdom of Science. Oh? What's that? Think you can sway me with a sword? How 'bout a generator? A generator? Are you freakin' kidding me? No way you could pull that off! [SENKU] Nice, you have native copper. [CHROME] Hey, that stuff's way too pretty to destroy. We'll melt it to make wire. [CHROME] Damnit, you're not even listening. Now then, if only we could get some lightning. [JASPER] It's lightning, the rage of the heavens! [ARGO] If it hits you, you're dead! Make sure the women and children are safe! [JASPER] Move! Quickly! Looks like we're getting our lightning. Ha! It is the rainy season, after all. Ah! Can you believe how lucky we are? This isn't luck, it's the worst-case scenario! We are in no way prepared to utilize this right now! The generator will run on lightning? That's ridiculous. Yes, of course. Magnets. I can make a generator if I have magnets. [SUIKA] But we have the ones we used to collect the sand. The natural ones are way too weak for what we need. We'll catch lightning with an iron rod, and make a crazy-strong magnet using the power of science! I was gonna put up a bunch of rods, as many as possible, but we can't pass up this opportunity. We'll just have to run with what we've got! Heh. Pardon the pun, but we gotta move fast as lightning! Melt the copper! There's lacquer coating Kohaku's shield; we could really use some of that! [SUIKA] I got a whole jar of it right here! Lacquer is a ridiculously effective insulator. Use it to coat the iron rod. I'm confused. Uh. I don't think you should be doing that! I've carved a channel in it! [SENKU] Pour the melted copper into the channel. And after it solidifies, wrap it up real tight around the iron bar. Hey, everybody, listen up! The foreigner and his friends have started destroying the bridge! Heh. So he's finally showing us his true, evil colors, huh? That's probably why the gods are so angry with us. They don't like that sorcery. Ah, yeah! All right. Time for them to die. [gasps] [CHROME] This is bad! It's Magma! [KOHAKU] He's not the kinda guy who talks things over. We're gonna have to fight! If we go to war with the village right now, it's game over! I need to think fast! [sighs] Now this won't do. I simply can't let myself get killed because of you lot. Fetch me some flowers, Suika. Huh? Instead of war, flowers. [ALL] Hm? [GEN] Ha! What in the hell is this guy holdin' flowers for? Doesn't he know we're lookin' for a fight? Yeah! Were you the one that made the gods so angry? Heh. Stepping up to me like this takes more balls than brains. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm afraid you're mistaken. We're trying to use our sorcery to stop this onslaught of terror from above. Quit talkin' outta your ass. I don't wanna hear-- Allow me to show you. [MANTLE, CARBO gasp] They disappeared! Did you see that? [KOHAKU] Wait a second. So they really can't see the flowers? [SENKU] It's a trick that I believe is called the back palm. Magicians do it all the time with cards and stuff. Hmph. Not too shabby for a complete fraud. [MANTLE screaming] Heh. [GEN sighs] [SENKU] It may sound nuts, but it's doable. There was a guy at NASA called Wasilewski who ran successful experiments using lightning to make powerful magnets. [WASILEWSKI] Wasilewski! I just so happened to find this bad boy on top of that bald mountain one day! Well, Chrome, I'd say that your ten years of exploration are really paying off now. Oh, yeah. Pretty bad, right? We're at the top of the bald mountain! [SENKU] Perfect spot to catch lightning. We couldn't ask for a better place! Set up the lightning rod, quickly! You see that? I think they wanna make a tower, should we--? No way! You're just after a silver spear, aren't you? We came here to keep an eye on them. Rules are rules, okay? The lightning's close now. Crap. There isn't enough time to build real scaffolding. Even so, we have to get as high as we can. If only there were something long that we could stick into the ground. [GINRO] Uh? No! Not happening! This is my spear! Guess you like it more than you let on. [KINRO screams] [yells] My spear! [chuckles] Well, take a look at that. The lightning god descends. [GEN laughs] This is crazy, Senku. Starting with nothing in this barren Stone World. You actually pulled it off. Electricity is in play. [SENKU] Get excited, people. Woohoo! We scored a magnet for our generator! Oh, no. Was your golden spear destroyed? I hope you can forgive me, Kinro. But it was kind of an emergency. I'm sure Senku will make you another one if you ask him. Hey, Kinro! Where did that special spear of yours go? Gone forever, huh? And you were so protective of it, too. I mean, you never even let me borrow it once, and yet here we are; it's a real shame. [GINRO groaning] [SUIKA] Uhh... Senku, I think we may have failed to create magnets. [gasps] They won't get anywhere near each other. Some force is driving them apart! Just switch one of their poles. [SENKU yelps] [KOHAKU, CHROME gasp] [SUIKA] Wow! They're so strong! We can make it now, can't we? That crazy-bad thing you call electricity? I'm curious, Senku. Are you creating a thermal generator? Or a wind turbine? I don't suppose you're going nuclear yet. It'll be muscle powered. I should've expected as much. We'll hammer the copper to stretch it, cut it into a disk, and grind it down. Yo! Let's try and grind this disk down with corundum. It's one of the baddest rocks I've got! The second-strongest mineral after diamond. I really admire your collection, Chrome. I'd thought we'd coat the copper wire with phosphoric acid, but this lacquer oughtta work just fine. I've been racking my brain trying to come up with the perfect quip, but I think I should just ask. [SENKU] What? Why do you look like a human marshmallow? Lacquer poisoning. [banging] Ah, yeah! [SENKU chuckles] The Kingdom of Science advances. [SENKU] Our dual-wield hand crank generator is now complete. So do we need to spin them both in unison? That seems pretty challenging. Not if two of us work together! If they get outta sync, it'll break down. The timing has to be perfect. Ugh. This has to be done right. If only we knew a pair who were perfectly coordinated and energetic. [ALL gasp] So you came back again. What do you want this time? C'mon! I'll let you guys check out our badass science machine! [KINRO] Not interested. [CHROME whines] You've always been a pretty stubborn guy, but now it feels like you're holding a grudge. [SENKU chuckles] He must still be upset that we ruined the golden spear I made for him. Huh? What now? [GEN] Wow, electricity sure is amazing! Thanks, sorcery! In our technological civilization, electricity lets us have all sorts of nice things! With our new generator, we might even be able to create and repair gold- and silver-tipped spears. Isn't that right, Senku? Electrocoating is pretty damn difficult. Do you actually know how to do it? I don't have the faintest idea. I was right about you. Every word out of your mouth really is just feathery fluff. [GINRO, KINRO yelling] They're a great team. Perfectly in sync. [SENKU chuckles] Kinro and Ginro are mine now. The Kingdom of Science is building up a solid workforce. But are they actually generating electricity? [SENKU] It's a steam-roasted bamboo fiber. [GEN] Uh. [KOHAKU] Does it need to be that high up? [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Not really. But I figure we might as well. [gasps] [GEN] I see now. He's using that bamboo fiber to create an Edison light bulb. I've never heard of a bulb of light. Chrome, does the night scare you? Well, yeah, because everything gets dark. Why do you ask? [SENKU] Back in my day, there was no darkness. With old man Edison's incandescent light bulb, humanity beat back the night. Conquering all 24 hours of the day. Through the power of science, mankind defeated the darkness. And now we're gonna do it again. For the first time in 3,700 years, the flame of science will burn.
