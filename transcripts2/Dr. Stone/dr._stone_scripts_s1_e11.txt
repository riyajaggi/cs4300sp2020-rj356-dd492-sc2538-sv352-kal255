 [yells] Your strike's too shallow! We're counting on those guys to make Ruri's medicine, but she'll never get it unless one of us wins the Grand Bout! Okay, so while Gen is busy smooth-talking ol' Tsukasa, the science team needs to start on our wonder drug. Hell yeah! What's next on our science journey? Another fundamental component, one as essential to civilization as iron. The first material in history to be synthesized using science.

 We call it glass. [SUIKA] Huh? [CHROME] What's that? I mean, now that we have electricity, isn't the plan to start making medicine? [SENKU] Yeah, it is. But in order to do that, we need glass first. Those clay pots aren't gonna cut it for the kind of experiments we'll be doing. Glass can stand up to just about any chemical. In fact, we wouldn't even have chemistry without it. And it's ten billion percent easy to process! It can be fragile or durable as hell. You can even see through it,

 which means you can observe the reactions inside. Seriously? That's bad! [SENKU chuckles] To top it off, once glass is acquired, we might finally get the chance to yank off that melon, take a look at Great Detective Suika, and finally see that mysterious mug. Yoink! Stop, Senku! Suika doesn't want anybody to see her face! I don't understand why not. [KOHAKU] Ooh! My gosh, Suika! You are just the most adorable little thing! [KOHAKU, CHROME] What in the hell?! [SUIKA] There's something wrong with my eyes. They've got the fuzzy sickness. Everything looks fuzzy to me, so when I try really hard to see, I end up looking like this, and it's super embarrassing. But when I put on my watermelon mask, it gets a little bit easier to see for some reason! Yeah, that's known as the "pinhole effect." If you look at an object through a small hole, the light passing through it narrows and brings it into focus. So glass and the fuzzy sickness, are they connected somehow? Dude, they're like ten billion percent connected! Here's the deal, Suika. You're nearsighted as hell. It's not some kind of sickness. There's nothing wrong with you. In a technological civilization, this isn't a big deal at all. We have scientific eyes, made outta glass. They're called glasses, and they help you see clearly. [SUIKA] Science users can actually make new eyes? That's amazing. It is. [SUIKA] If it's really possible, I'd love to see all the beauty in the world. Even just once. [SUIKA] I wanna see you guys without the fuzziness. I wanna see the real you. Just one time would be all I needed. [CHROME] All right. I'm ready to do this! Let's make some of this glass! [KOHAKU] Oh, yeah! What materials do we need to gather? [SENKU] Glass is mostly made out of silica, or quartz sand. Heh. However, I didn't see any of that in the Chrome Collection. [CHROME] Why in the heck would I be collecting sand? Although, I did see a clue that should lead us to some. [CHROME] This is the spot. When I was a kid, I found this cool, see-through rock right here. Well, that little chunk is worth more than you could imagine right now. That translucent rock you've got in your hand is a quartz crystal, and it tends to be found in areas of decayed granite. [SENKU] And in my hand, I'm holding lots of the raw material for glass: Quartz sand. [ALL gasp] Whoa, bad. Those tiny white grains are falling out like crazy! I didn't know this would be so fun! We're gonna get a bunch of this stuff here! Just try and gather as many of the see-through ones as you can. [SENKU] We crush all the quartz sand down into even finer grains. Then we mix it with a bunch of other stuff and melt it. [CHROME] Do we need to get anything? Actually, we've already gathered everything we're gonna need. Our hard work keeps paying off. Ten percent calcium carbonate from the sea shells, then add 20% cooked seaweed. [SENKU] All of the same materials we used back when we made soap. Now that's done. I can't believe you've got galena! Lead has been acquired! [SENKU] We throw in a bit of molten lead, and lo and behold, we have super-transparent crystal glass, perfect for a lens. [CHROME gasps] It's all sparkly and see-through, kinda like a piece of ice! Or some sorta gem. [SUIKA] So what's that weird tool thing do? [SENKU] It'll polish the glass, 'cause doin' it by hand would kill us. [CHROME] Ooh! I bet we can use that super bad corundum stuff I've got for polishing it up, whaddaya think? Glass has a Mohs hardness rating of about a six. Corundum's is nine, so it's perfect! Aw, yeah! It's gonna work like a charm! [SENKU] Of course, the hardest one is diamond, which is up there at ten. Diamond is crazy! That's freakin' insane! Suika, I want you to look straight ahead of you and tell me what you see. [SUIKA] I see sunflowers, of course. It's not like I can't see anything at all, ya know? I just have to try-- [CHALK howls] [yelling] Come on! Again with that shallow strike! Kinro, you've got to break that habit! If you wanna fight with a spear, you have to be able to judge distance, or you'll never beat Magma! [GINRO] Judging distance. Right. I heard what she said, but I don't know how you're gonna be able to do that. I mean, let's be honest here, you obviously have the fuzzy sickness. That's the main reason why you have such a menacing look on your face. I was born like this. Don't you understand, Kinro? It would be better if you went up to her and said, "I'm not weak, it's just my eyes. I know how to fight already. And if you wanna know the truth, I'm incredibly strong, okay?" Such excuses are unbecoming of a grown man. Don't tell anyone about this, Ginro. [CHALK barking] [SUIKA] It's kinda surprising, but both you guys look really cool. And why is that so surprising? [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] It's finally time to make some glass equipment. And now that Suika's leveled up on her labor potential statistics, that means we can actually put together a full chemistry set. Calling it "labor potential" is rude! Way to ruin the moment, man! [SENKU, SUIKA laugh] [CHROME] What's so funny? What are you laughing about? [SENKU chuckles] Get excited to start our primitive glass-making class! Yeah! I'm ready to do this, Senku! We keep throwing in these black rocks, right? [SUIKA] I'm gonna to keep these comin' for ya, guys! Ah! Wow, Suika, you're like a little speed demon. How cool. Now that everything's not fuzzy, it makes things way easier. Whoa, there are little white bubbles comin' outta that stuff. That's what we want. When you heat obsidian like this, it creates a foam. [SENKU] Then, we'll use that foam as insulation and make a specialized glassblowing furnace. Next, we'll craft an iron straw, use it to blow up the glass with air, and that's it. [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Hey, that's fine. This was our first try. When I started making clay pots, it took months before they looked decent. It's not fine! We don't have months to get it right this time! Ruri's health doesn't seem to be getting better. I'm not some kinda glass craftsman, so I have to learn by trial and error. A craftsman? I don't care for this one bit, Chrome! [SENKU] Who the hell is that old fart? Oh, come on, Old Man Kaseki! We're in desperate need of your crafting skills! Now, is this really how you youngins ask for favors these days? 'Cause I'm not into this kinky rope play stuff. And I'm definitely not interested in being a part of whatever black arts you're doing here. See? And this is why I had to do things the hard way. Old Man Kaseki. I forgot to bring your lacquer back to you. I'm sorry. Ah, that had slipped my mind. Tell me, were you the one who made that? Her lacquered shield is amazing. And you crafted it without iron tools and hardly any dyes to speak of? [KASEKI] Yep! That shield was a prize from the year that Kohaku's father, Kokuyo, became the champion of the Grand Bout. I tell ya, I really did go all out when I made that old beauty. Gosh, that does take me back. [KOHAKU giggling] [SENKU] The handiwork on that shield is remarkable for this era. So I had a feeling there must be an expert craftsman behind it. But I never expected you'd be a dusty old fossil. Did you make that awesome suspension bridge, as well? Yeah, I sure did. And you had the nerve to pull the planks out! So you can count me out of whatever bogus sorcery you-- [gasps] Wait, what is this see-through stonework you've got? Wow. [SENKU, CHROME snickering] [SENKU] We won't force you to help if you don't want to. So just sit back and watch the show. You should get a kick outta this, Kaseki. In fact, I bet you're gonna be ten billion percent entertained. So get ready to get excited! [KASEKI] Hmm. It would seem that heat makes the material pliable and soft. It's like blubber. [KASEKI] The shape changes so easily! Crap, blew it up too much again. [KASEKI] What are you doing you fool?! Stop! [KASEKI] He's not spinning it steadily at all. At this rate, he's never going to make a good vessel or anything worth the effort. Are they doing it this badly on purpose just to piss me off? Because that's definitely what's happening. [chuckles] There's no way a guy who spent his whole life as a craftsman is gonna stand there and watch a newbie do something as drool-tastic as glassblowing. How much more of this can you take, Old Man Kaseki? This has gotta be getting under your skin. [growls] I can't take it anymore! [yells] Boy! You got me real good, damn it! [BOTH] Uh. Let me take a crack at it! [CHROME screaming] He's jacked. Who'd've guessed? Suika, water! On it, sir! Ah, man! That's nuts! You'd never seen it before, and you're like a glass-making master! [SENKU chuckles] It's because he's got all those years of crafting experience. [laughs] I've been a craftsman for 50 years, believe it or not. In fact, son, I'm kind of a big deal. There are people like him in every single era. Dudes with true talent who've spent their whole lives with their heads down and completely dedicated to their work. --Awesome! --[SUIKA] Yay! Oh, wow! [CHROME] Come on, Senku, what's the matter with you, man? We finally have a killer lab! I thought you'd get excited! [SENKU] Yeah, sure. Yippee. At this point, we've reached the dawn of chemistry. Things are starting to get fancy here in our neck of the woods. Just look at all the attractions. It's gotta be ten billion times more fun than Tsukasa Land. Because the Kingdom of Science rules! Long time no see! Mecha Senku, at your service! Here to take you on a tour of the Kingdom of Science! This is the kingdom's home base. It's a treasure trove of minerals Chrome's been collecting since he was a kid. Ha-ha! I've got tons of awesome stuff! [SENKU] Our scientific gourmet dish: Foxtail millet ramen! Now this is somethin' I can eat all day! It's so yummy! [SENKU] We rely on strength in numbers to make our iron supply! Take it to 1,500 degrees! This is such crazy-tough work. I'll be up in a second. Probably. [SENKU] To beat Magma, we built this hellish training arena. Actually, it's just part of the clearing. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Friendship! Hard work! Victory! You're just sleeping! Get with the program! Wake up! Let's go! [KINRO, GINRO yelling] [SENKU] We've got the ultimate in green energy: The elbow grease generator! [yells] [SENKU] Blowing glass with the skill of an absolute master. Shaping it just like clay. [SENKU] The scorching hot glass is cooled. Nice and slow, 'cause we don't want it to crack. [SENKU] Our state of the art laboratory. We're speeding through the sulfa drug route with all the bad chemicals we can get our hands on! Man, this is really amazing, isn't it? The Kingdom of Science is starting to turn into something. [SENKU chuckles] We've only made the bare essentials so far. We wouldn't get anywhere if we were missing a single one of these components. So before the whole world collapsed, was the technology, like, ridiculous or what? Yeah. It took two million years for us to get there. And we're going to catch up and run right past it. [CHROME chuckles] Our next step is the sulfa drug. We're gonna make ourselves a cure-all. [SUIKA] Yay! [KASEKI] Yay! --[SUIKA] Yay! --[KASEKI] Yay! --Yay! Yay! --Yay! Yay! Oh, man. Their team's so lucky. It looks like fun. They're playing. They got shiny stuff. [gasps] Hey, Kinro, how's this idea? What if the spear tip was like, super shiny? Don't you think that would improve your training since you could get a better sense of distance with your fuzzy vision. What are you babbling about? You're starting to annoy me. Uh... [laughs] Oh, well, uh, if we're talkin' 'bout things that are shiny, we need gold and silver spears! That would be so freakin' awesome, right? I mean, strictly to use in the Grand Bout, of course. Those will definitely give us just the edge we need to win, won't they? [BOTH grunt] [SENKU] Eh? [GINRO gasping] I don't know anything about fighting. Is it true that a gold and silver spear'll help them beat Magma? Or is that just crap? Okay. I'll put it in a way you'll understand. They ten billion percent only want gold and silver spears because they think that'll make 'em cool. Oh, wow! Would you look at all of this "glass," was it? And this beautiful working area. With this kinda stuff, a silver spear must be a snap to make! And then takin' down Magma would be easy-peasy! [SENKU laughs] Yeah, good point. And now that we have our glassware, we're gonna have to suck it up and go get the next ingredient. Which is also the most difficult material to obtain. All right, let's break in this lab with a silver spear. But only a silver one. --[KINRO grunts] --[GINRO laughs] Oh, I'm so sorry about that, Kinro. It's my way. I'm always everyone's favorite. [SENKU] You are in no way my favorite, you clown. This mission is quite risky. It may well cost you your life, Ginro. Huh? [SENKU] We're going to set off on a grand adventure. One where we'll discover chemistry's greatest treasure. So you'll be exploring an area that's ridiculously dangerous. Where you could literally die in an instant. Uh?
