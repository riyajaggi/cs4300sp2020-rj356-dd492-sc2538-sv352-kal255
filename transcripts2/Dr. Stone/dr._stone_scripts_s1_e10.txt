 [SENKU] When I first became interested in science, I read a biography about Thomas Edison. [SENKU] What the heck is electricity, anyway? [SENKU] Wow, so there are only four fundamental forces in the universe? Gravitational... Five plus three, equals... [SENKU] ...and then "strong force" and "weak force." [SENKU chuckles] That sounds ridiculously weird. [SENKU] So in the entire universe,

 electricity is like, the most essential power. That gets me excited! [SENKU] I was reborn into a primitive world, butt naked and completely alone. But a year and four months into my scientific journey... [SENKU] ...I've reached the essential power: Electricity. [SENKU] I gotta say, I'm off to a damn good start. [GEN] Man, electricity in the stone age! It's hard to believe. [GEN] Right, Tsukasa? [KOHAKU] So you see, Suika, the long-haired man, Tsukasa, is the one who was behind Senku's murder. [SENKU chuckles]

 Even though I'm still alive. That guy's seriously bad news. He wanted to stop scientific progress, and that's why he killed Senku without hesitation. Even though I'm still alive. So if this Tsukasa is some kinda violent bad guy, and Gen has been working with him, that means Gen's a bad guy, too! But isn't Gen also the person who saved us from Magma? Then he's a good guy! [SENKU chuckles] He's honestly not a good guy or a bad guy. He's nothing but a rat who's only in it for himself. It actually doesn't matter to me if he's good or bad. At the end of the day, we need him to be an ally of the Kingdom of Science. We'll have him give a bogus report to Tsukasa, saying "Senku is definitely dead." That's the only possible hope we have of winning this. [CHROME] Listen up, Gen! I know you saw the electricity! The light! That's what badass science at work looks like! So why care about who wins? Why even give a crap whether Senku or Tsukasa has the edge? 'Cause the Kingdom of Science is obviously the side that's more fun! Oh, is that so? You are the passionate type. Too bad for you, I don't really care about that. I'm probably the most superficial man on Earth. All I consider is what's beneficial to me. [GEN] Uh. Uhh... What is this, some kind of prank? I'll have to have a word with my manager. They should understand that I'm a mentalist. Doing a show where I'm the target of a prankster goes against my image. Welcome to the year 5739 A.D. Though the year has changed, you're still only 19. Say what? Hold on. You were on the special about psychological magic. We did that gig together. [GEN] I believe you were called the "strongest primate high-schooler." Shishio Tsukasa! I've made a choice. You and all of these statues are among the people who I believe should be revived first. I've gathered all of you into one place. [gasps] Those dusty old fossils who used to be in power are even less necessary in this natural world of stone. But I see a massive amount of potential in you, Gen. [TSUKASA] There's something I need you for, and your skills as a mentalist will be invaluable. Follow them for me, and get inside of their minds. Perhaps I'm being overly cautious, but I want you to track down this man Senku and tell me if he's dead or hiding out somewhere. [GEN] Who is Senku? [TSUKASA] He was the first of us to revive. He used his knowledge of science to create a formula to undo the petrification. That's how he revived me. This man--his only desire is to revive everyone, no matter who they were. He'll bring back the same people who ruined our world, and they'll make weapons. He was the most intelligent man alive, and that's why I killed him myself. [gasps] Who are...? [GEN] Why? [KOHAKU] What was that noise? [BOTH gasp] Holy crap, what happened here? Damn it. Looks like he died instantly. This is horrible! Hang on a second! [SENKU] He protected himself with fake blood bags. He's got these things all over his body! This is really freakin' bad! I bet he did this before he even came to the village, just in case. Tch. That's pretty impressive, Gen. You really are a magician to your core. Not to mention a showman. [KOHAKU] Those bags may have helped block the spear, but he's still really beat up. Damn it. We gotta catch whoever did this. First, we need to find out who'd do such an awful thing. [SENKU] Huh? [SUIKA] I'm gonna investigate! [SUIKA] Big news, guys! I found out something huge! Excellent work, Great Detective Suika. Do you mind tellin' us what it is? I figured out who attacked Gen last night! I know who killed him! [KOHAKU] Uh, you know, he's not dead. [SENKU] Well, so who was it? [SUIKA] It was...! [laughing] Now that I've killed that sorcerer, I'm the most powerful one! Everyone should fear Magma! I thought he'd put up more of a fight, but that was as easy as taking a toy from a baby! Oh, yeah! I bet it was easy for you! [MAGMA] Would've been better to go on and kill Kohaku, too. But that woman never seems to let her guard down. Well, I think that she's way too strong to be a normal woman. The only explanation has to be some kinda sorcery. [MAGMA laughs] [MAGMA] But now that I've gotten rid of her powerful ally, she's just like every other little girl. [chuckles] Though if she begs me to spare her, I wouldn't mind letting her join her sister, and both of them can be my women. [MANTLE] I don't know who would be luckier. You having both sisters, or them having the great Magma! [MAGMA, MANTLE laughing] [SUIKA] This is really bad news! [MAGMA, MANTLE laughing] It was Magma? That bastard! I see. When Magma came over here, Gen made those flowers vanish right before his eyes. I imagine from his perspective, Gen has to be the mysterious foreign sorcerer that I had tried to bring into the village. So Magma tried to murder Gen because he mistook him for Senku? Heh. What's more offensive is Magma has the nerve to go around saying that my strength comes from sorcery! Well, I always thought you had the strength of a gorilla because you were one. [CHROME] Sorry, ma'am. Got a question for ya, Kohaku. Why would Magma be looking for an opportunity to kill you? It's probably because-- no, it's definitely because of the Grand Bout. Once every generation, the village holds a big martial arts battle. It's a tradition called the Grand Bout. [SENKU] So that explains the thing on the far island that looks like an arena. [KOHAKU] The last one was several months ago, on the day that my sister, the village priestess Ruri, came of age. [KOHAKU] Whoever won the Grand Bout was supposed to marry her and become the next village chief. That's how my father became the current village chief. [MAGMA chuckles, yells] [HAGANE groans] [JASPER] The winner is Magma! Moving on to the final round. Damn, man. Magma's an unstoppable force of nature! Oh, yeah! [RURI coughing] Ruri! Hey, Ruri! Are you okay? [TURQUOISE] Stop right there! You know you can't just casually walk up to the priestess! [CHROME gasps] Ruri? Bet she's got one more year, at most. I don't want that kinda hassle. If she just went ahead and croaked, I could take over as chief without having to deal with her. I could make it look like she drowned. Everyone would think her sickness drove her to throw herself off a cliff. [yells] [gasps] Have mercy on me! The winner of the Grand Bout is Kohaku! Magma, I cannot allow you to marry Ruri! A man like you doesn't even deserve to be in her presence! [MAGMA] I get it now. Kohaku joined the Grand Bout just to get in my way! Does anybody know what's gonna happen now? I mean, the rules do say that whoever wins is supposed to marry Ruri. [GINRO gasps] I guess that means Ruri and Kohaku will just have to marry each other then! That's super forbidden love! [TURQUOISE] Obviously not! My word. What should we do now? Who's going to marry Priestess Ruri? [SENKU chuckles] [SENKU] Hilarious. I bet your old man disavowed you after that little stunt. Well, let's just say that was the final straw that broke his patience. Kohaku's given the chief a lotta headaches. She's been that way her whole life. [KOHAKU] Of course, the Grand Bout ended up getting rescheduled. There'll be another one next month. [CHROME] Are you saying the real reason Magma killed Gen is so he can win the Grand Bout? [SUIKA] What?! Gen really is dead? That's horrible! [KOHAKU] No, he's still alive. Oh, man, it would be bad news if Magma became the new chief. [SENKU] Yeah. With a guy like Magma in that position, getting the medicine to Ruri will prove to be even more difficult than it already is. Heh. I see it as an opportunity. If a man from the Kingdom of Science were to beat Magma and win the Grand Bout, they'd marry Ruri and become the chief. That would fix everything. It would mean more people in the Kingdom of Science, and make it easy to get the medicine to Ruri. Listen up, guys, I have an important question for you. What do you think about Ruri? Do either one of you want her to be your wife? [KINRO, GINRO gasp] Uh. I've never really thought about it before. Would I marry her? I mean, Ruri is super pretty. Kinda looks like you, but better. First off, she's way got way bigger, I mean-- She's just so graceful and cute, with big, round eyes! There's more to a woman than how she looks. Is her appearance really all you care about? I had no idea you were so shallow, Ginro. Hey, you heard me. I said... she had a bigger amount of grace about her. I have a very simple answer. Guards don't have discussions. The rules are the rules. But listening to one murmur to themselves is not against the rules. I've seen it myself. Senku's definitely not an evil person. [KINRO] So do what you normally do. Skip the details and tell us what you want. The only thing I want is to save my sister's life. [KINRO] All right. [GINRO] You don't have to explain any further. I understand. Nope! Your attacks are all way too shallow! [KINRO screams] [GINRO] I think it's time for a break! [KINRO] Come on! Let's get through three more rounds, first! Hold up. [KOHAKU] Hey, Chrome. If you wanna know the truth, I'd rather be training you. But Kinro and Ginro are the only ones who really have a chance of taking down Magma. I'm sorry. Yo, Chrome, the only reason she's apologizing is because the plan means that one of those guys would marry Ruri, even though we all know you're in love with her! Did you have to say that? You're blunt, but that was brutal. [CHROME] This place is amazing! [RURI coughing] [CHROME] Hey, Ruri! I'm okay. You've always got a little cough, don't you? [RURI] Chrome, they told me I'm never gonna get better. [gasps] [RURI] I'm not gonna live to become an adult. I can figure out how to cure you! I'll gather everything I can find. I promise! I know I'll make you feel better someday. Yeah. I'm totally cool with that. [CHROME] If we can create something with science that lets her live a long, happy life, that sounds good to me! Because above all else, I'm a genius scientist, aren't I? [chuckles] So you're finally changing job titles from sorcerer to scientist, huh? [CHROME] Yup! I'm not a sorcerer anymore! Then let's leave the Grand Bout stuff to the battle team, while you and I, on the science team, get to work on the sulfa drug. Hell yeah! I'm planning on participating in the Grand Bout. The two brothers and I will be the Kingdom of Science team. We'll do whatever it takes to keep Magma form winning. Sounds good. Is he all right? He looks way worse. I think he'll be fine, but his recovery's gonna take longer than we thought. And that means... Yeah. It won't be long before Tsukasa comes around lookin' for me, and then kills me for real. [inaudbile] [inaudbile] [inaudbile] [GINRO] I'm still sleepy. Well, it's time to wake up. We agreed to do training in the morning until we rotate on guard duty. [CHROME] This is bad! Gen's not here! He vanished somehow! Yeah, well. It's obvious where he went. Back to Tsukasa. But why? Why sneak out like that? I bet that rat's gonna snitch. He's gonna go and tell Tsukasa that Senku is still alive! Not good, Senku. We have to try and stop him! [gasps] Wait, Tsukasa! It's me! [GEN] I found a village. Full of primitives. [GEN] They attacked me, and I ended up getting a little banged up in the process. But I did manage to find out about Senku. We have to catch that bastard, right now! [SENKU] No, stop! What are you doing, Senku? If we don't catch him, it's game over for you! I'm just saying, I think we can let him be for now. Look at it this way. If Gen really didn't have a millimeter of interest in science, he never would've cooperated in the first place. He made up his mind about what side he was on the moment I made electricity. That's what got him. But he's still a completely superficial man to his core. So he ran away to give us a show. [groans] You men. Such a pain in the ass. No matter what era. [GEN] Ah. This ramen is making me wickedly thirsty. A cola would be great. [GEN] Even in this Stone World could you make one for me? Just one cola? Yeah. For sure. Nobody else can. [GEN] Senku... was gone. No trace of him anywhere. There's no doubt. He's definitely not alive. Whoa! So Gen's gonna join the Kingdom of Science? Yeah. He'll come back before too long and act like nothin' happened. Heh. Well, I guess that was our first battle against the Tsukasa Empire. In the fight over Asagiri Gen, the Kingdom of Science claims victory! [SUIKA] Gen turned out to be a good guy after all! [CHROME] Yeah! [SENKU] It's the world's most flimsy alliance. Bound by a single bottle of cola. [GEN] Man, this isn't worth all the trouble. For just one bottle of cola? I hope it's ice cold. That's the very least he could do. Tch. So my next step is to use my knowledge of science to make him an ice cold cola. And I would love to have it ready by the time he makes it back.
