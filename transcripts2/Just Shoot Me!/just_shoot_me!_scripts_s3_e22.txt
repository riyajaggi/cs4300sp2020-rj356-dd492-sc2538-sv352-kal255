 Hey, remember that horrible screenplay I read a couple months ago for my friend Ashley? No. Not really. Yeah, sure you do. The one about the golden retriever with the bomb in its brain, that gets loose on the subway? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was called Stay. That's it. Well, get this. It just sold for $650,000! No kidding. Yeah. I mean, I love Ashley. Couldn't be happier for her.

 But she's not even a writer. She's a geneticist. And an average one at that. She wrote that script as a lark at her stupid summer house in Nantucket with her stupid husband and her two stupid, ugly children. I hope Ashley knows how lucky she is to have a friend like you. She's so stupid, she probably doesn't. Good morning, Jack. How was the weekend? Lousy. I had a little mishap when I took Hannah to Tots and Tubes. Why? What happened? Well, we were playing hide and seek like we do normally... Five, six, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ready or not, here I come! Gonna getcha! Hannah Banana.

 I'm comin' to getcha! Comin' to getcha. Yes, I am. I'm comin'... My back just locked up. I couldn't move a muscle. I was completely stuck. Oh, my God. That's terrible. It gets worse. Thanks, kid. I've never been so humiliated. I got to get in shape. Starting today. Yeah. Garfield loves lasagna. Well, no offense, Jack, but every year you try to get in shape and every year you just end up buying the latest rowing machine. You use it once and throw it away. I don't throw it away. I give it to my nanny, Consuela, who, thanks to me, can now row across the Gulf of Mexico like it was a lap pool. Well, if you're really serious this time, there's this personal trainer at the gym downstairs who's supposed to be dynamite. Huh, personal trainer. Yeah, he has a crush on me, but I'm not interested and I don't know why. Anyway, I could introduce you. Is he good? Well, he's a former Navy Seal. I guarantee you, Jack, in no time, he'll have you doing a six-minute mile. Please, Jack couldn't do a six-minute mile if you pushed him out of an airplane. Dagwood is always hungry. Jack, this is Craig, the personal trainer I told you about. Oh, hi, Craig. Thanks for coming in. Pleasure to meet you, sir! Miss Van Horn, I was wondering if later maybe you'd like to join me for a smoothie? Well, that's a colorful way of putting it, but the answer is no. So, Craig. I know you're a busy guy. Let me tell you about my situation... No, sir, let me tell you. You wanna get in shape, but you can't self-motivate. Exactly. As a boss, you make your own rules, yet you need to be pushed! Uncanny. You are an older father and are worried about keeping up with the younger guys! Hey, you're better than that guy who bends spoons on Merv Griffin. You're hired. Not so fast, sir. I don't take on every client that comes my way. How committed are you? Very. Not good enough! Tell you what. I'm gonna write you a check for the whole year's worth of sessions. How's that for commitment? I am not impressed with your money, sir. Well, maybe you'll be impressed by this. Dennis? Yeah! I want you to throw out every donut in this building. What about cinnamon buns? Did I say cinnamon buns? Call me when you're serious, sir. Hey, Craig, listen to me. I request... No, I demand that you push me into fighting shape. That you allow me no excuses. That no matter what I say, no matter how I beg, you will not let up on me. Do you understand? Yes, sir. I can't hear you! Yes, sir! We will start at 5:30 tomorrow. 5:30? What about 5:00? Very good, sir! I shall see you at the crack of dawn. Good God, you mean the morning? Hey, ready to go? What? Come on, dinner. That acrobat restaurant we talked about. Come on, we gotta hurry. For happy hour, they shoot the wine steward out of a cannon. Yeah. At least once a week he misses the net. Come on. Oh, no. You guys, I'm sorry. I forgot all about it. I just got to working on my screenplay and I lost track of time. Oh, you're actually gonna write one, huh? Yeah. What's it about? Ah, can I trust you? As long as you're not drunk and wearing a tube top. It's about a cop with a troubled past who plays by his own rules. Oh, you mean like, ah, Lethal Weapon and Serpico and 48 Hrs. And Dirty Harry and... No, no, no. It's not like any of those. My guy works at night. Why? I don't know. He doesn't make the schedule, his sergeant does. I thought you said he played by his own rules. Well, I haven't worked it all out yet! Okay, okay. Hey, it sounds good. Come on, Finch. He should be a vampire. Who? Your cop. That's why he only works at night. He has to solve crime by morning. All right, see ya. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If he's a vampire, he would have to drink people's blood. That would make him a bad guy, right? Um, not if he drinks the blood of the killers he catches. See ya. No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to stay and sort of help me out a little bit? No. Finch, seriously, I'm starving. If you're not coming, I'm leaving without you. Thanks for understanding. No, wait, but I'm hungry. We'll order in. Oh, I see what you're doing. Trying to soak me for ideas. Well, guess what, sister? It doesn't work that way. Finch, think of all the women you can tell you're a screenwriter. Too late. I already do. When we finish, I'll make you dinner in a tube top. Scootch. There he is! The workout king! Nothing like a little exercise to make you feel like a million bucks, huh? You know what? I already got a million bucks. Fire Craig. Me? Why me? I don't even like him. I don't know why. Well, I know why I don't like him. He chased me across Central Park with a bullhorn this morning, screaming motivational obscenities. Well, why don't you just fire him yourself? Because I'll look like a quitter if I fire him, and I'm no quitter. But aren't you, in fact, now quitting? No, I'm calling a truce, cutting my losses. It's actually quite noble. How can a vampire go to the Treasury Department if it's only open during the day? Solar eclipse. Oh, that's good. That's very good. Yup. Hey, what are you guys talking about? Um, our screenplay. "Our"? Yeah, we're writing it together. Since when? Ah, since last night. He's amazing... No. She's amazing. No. I just react. You're the heart and soul of this project. Hey, if you want, I can help. Ah, no, that's, that's okay. No, hey, I got a lot of good ideas, and I tend to think visually. My eye is a thousand times better than Finch's. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Give the villain a thousand eyes? Bingo! Come on. Good morning, Miss Van Horn. Craig. Where you going? I have recon with Mr. Gallo. Oh, no. That's not gonna happen, Craig. Apparently, I'm not the only one who doesn't want to get sweaty with you. Why don't I want to get sweaty with you? Ma'am, that is a question I ask myself each and every night, as I weep into my pillow like a sad little boy. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to recon with Mr. Gallo. You don't understand, Craig. He quit. Negative, we are in the middle of a scheduled workout. Look, I'm sorry, but I can't let you in there. Still nothing. Sorry, friend. Let me handle this, Nina. Mr. Gallo's office is off-limits. Unacceptable! I have a mission. Look, if he says he's unavailable, he's unavailable. No, you look. I train politicians, CEOs, movie producers. I cannot be intimidated by the likes of you. Did you say "movie producers"? Yeah, I did. You know, I happen to have a really hot project going right now. It's real hush-hush and I'd love to get it in the hands of someone with the juice to make it happen. If you facilitate your boss' fitness regimen, I will put you in a room with a very powerful Hollywood producer. All right, tell him you hit me with the phone. All right, sir, let's get back at it. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Nina! Oh. I gave you my word that I would restore you to full fitness, and that is exactly what I intend to do. Very good. Dennis. I tell you what. For every mile you run, I will run 40. For every pushup, I will do 40. That is my 40-to-1 promise to you! Great. I miss one workout, you miss 40. See you in six weeks. I will do everything in my power to inspire you. On our runs, I will circle you like a border collie. When you are hurting, I will snap my wrists in half to feel similar pain. In fact, sir, if I snap my wrists right now, would that inspire you? Because I will do it! Slam the drawer, sir! Snap my wrists in two! Anybody! Anybody at all! Snap them, sir! Snap them! Break my wrist like you broke your promise! Okay. Okay. Stop that! I'll go to the gym. You'll what? I'll go to the gym. That's the breakthrough I was looking for! That is the stuff! Welcome back, sir. And may I say, I will never give up on you. Never. Well, let's just... Never! Oh! Hey. You working? No, we're making a cake. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You don't have to sound so sarcastic. Oh, no, no. It's a catch phrase from our movie. Yeah. Hmm, what kind of catch phrase is that? He would make the perfect Lieutenant Scagnetti. Oh, my God, totally. He's a psycho. Oh, my God. Hey, Nina. Elliott, the funniest thing just happened. What? I was talking on the phone with my friend Binnie, when she accidentally dropped her cell phone out of her moving limo. Go on. Seriously? Yeah. Yeah. Why are you suddenly so interested in my stories? What do you mean? I love your stories. Oh, that is so sweet. Oh, poor Elliott. Feeling all left out of Finch and Maya's little project. I am not. Who cares about their stupid movie? Oh, listen. I know what it feels like to be an outsider. I tell you what, let's go and have lunch. Just me and you. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, Nina, let's go to lunch! Um, hey, could you guys keep it down? Finch and I have a really important meeting and we need to work. Oh, I'm sorry. Nina was just telling me the funniest story. Binnie dropped her cell phone out of a limo, and this nice stockbroker picked it up and now I have a date with him. That's the perfect way for Heather to meet the outlaw vampire in the first act. Get in here. What about lunch? Oh, that is so sweet. I'll take a cobb salad. What about you guys? - Club sandwich. - Corned beef. Thanks. Nina, I need your help. I'll say. You look like a gay European pop star. I couldn't change my shirt. I just worked out, and I can't lift my arms. Listen, do me a favor. Sure, Jack. Take Craig out tonight barhopping, and get him so drunk he blacks out so he won't show up tomorrow. Jack, you can't just ask me to change all my plans at the last second. Why, what else are you doing? Well, all right! I guess he can tag along. Good. I can't believe we're meeting with a real live Hollywood producer. Now settle down, Jethro. Oh, when you pitch the warehouse scene, do Lieutenant Castro's voice. Fangs or no fangs, I want your badge. I just got chills. Yeah. Remember your ad-libs. Oh, yeah, got 'em right here. Good. Hey, you guys. I thought of a great slogan for your Vampire Cop movie. Ready? Get this. "Sometimes justice bites." Catchy, huh? Umm, not now. Thank you. We've got it. You know what? Vampire Cop sucks. Actually, that one I like. I'll make a card. Hello, gorgeous. Hey, hot shot. I'm Charlie Gold. It's really him! Maya, be cool. Be cool. We really appreciate you meeting with us, Mr. Gold. Hey, baby, it's my pleasure. My trainer says you are aces, and thanks to him, I am as strong as a freakin' ox. Go on, punch me in the stomach. Oh, no, that's okay. Maya, you're embarrassing us. Punch the man. Hit him hard. Oh, it's just as well. The last time I got punched by a dame, I ended up marrying her and losing my home. Am I a sucker for a beautiful woman? You better bet I am. You ever do any acting, doll? I was the original Nicholas on Eight is Enough. The bangs... So, what's good here? Do they have duck? I tell you, if I could have duck with every meal, I would. I'd eat duck for breakfast. I'd eat it for lunch. I'd eat duck for dinner. It would all be duck. Duck's good. Yeah. You know who else loved duck? Angie Dickinson. Wow, what a woman. I remember once we were driving to Atlantic City. Was I angry about being trashed in the pages of Life magazine? You better bet I wasn't. You know why? Because it made me stronger. It gave me the steel clackers to succeed. And baby, when they strip away everything else, that is all you got in this life. Is your clackers. Oh. Mr. Gold... Please, call me Gold. Okay. Gold. Um, it's getting kind of late and we really have to be getting back to work, so maybe we should get started. Oh, yeah. Whatever you want, babe. You know, 9:00 to 5:00 was never my bag. I just go where the magic takes me. So, okay. Let's hear what you got. I'm in a buying mood. All right. Okay, are you ready? It's called Vampire... Cop. No, I've seen it. What else you got? Tube Top Fever? It's a plight of a woman and her two... Morning, ma'am. Oh. With all the drinking we did last night, I'm sure you feel as bad as I do. Yes, why do bars have to close? Did you end up finding your shoes at the club? Ah, no, ma'am. I taped some napkins to my feet and walked home. Hey, are you okay? You look terrible. I am not gonna lie to you, sir. I enjoyed a night on the town with Miss Van Horn. Look, Craig, if you're not feeling well, we can work out another time. Negative. You will work out as scheduled. I was thinking. I want to take you up on that 40-to-1 promise you made, today. Today? You betcha. Say, how do sit-ups sound? Well, actually... Terrific. Okay, here we go. And, one. And, two. Okay, now you do 80. Reach down deep, Craig. Look, if you don't feel up to this, Craig, just say so. I will not quit on you, sir. And, one, two, three... Say, you don't mind if I have a little snack, do you? Four, five... Whoa. Hey, do you think this egg salad's gone bad? 78, 79... You know what, Craig? I think I got another one in me. And, one. Okay, now you do 40 more. Oh, God, I can't go on, sir! Boy, you and Nina really tied one on, huh? Oh, yeah, and I have let you down. I feel sorrow from the bottom of my heart. Dear Lord, my nipple's pierced! Where does that chain go to? Oh! Oh! Where you going? I feel a little upset right now. Oh, is it because I won't date you? Listen, I wish I could tell you why, but I don't even know myself. Huh, I'm complex. Ma'am, I have failed. I have disgraced myself, the Navy, and the good Noodleman name. Noodleman? That used to be my last name. Where you from? Colby, Kansas. Good, God. Who's your pappy? Bud. Holy smokes, we're cousins! Oh! Huh. You did what? And put your face all the way under the water? I'm so proud of you, Hannah. This summer, we'll go swimming at the beach all the time. Of course I'll give you horse-y rides just like Jessica's daddy. All the way from the pier to the lighthouse? That's pretty far. Okay, honey, you can count on Daddy. Love you. Bye. Dennis, did Craig leave yet? No, he's throwing up in a plant. Well, clean him up and get him back in here. I gotta get in shape. As you see, it's just a simple tale of an outsider betrayed by the very people he trusted the most. Let me ask you this, does he play by his own rules? You better bet he does. I'm intrigued. I like it. Yeah. But I have to do it my way. My vision cannot be compromised. What if... What if he was a talking horse from the future? Even better.
