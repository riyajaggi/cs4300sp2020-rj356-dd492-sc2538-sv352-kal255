 Nina, do you have the time? Time? Why don't you just come out and say it? Huh? You want to know who my secret boyfriend is. Well, you're not gonna find out. Not now, not ever. Maya, what time is the... 7:00 sharp. Oh, you're the safari hunter. What's happening? Nina, here. It's your character for my murder mystery dinner tonight. Oh, thank God. I thought it was a subpoena.

 You're the bastard son of the wealthy land baron. And you're the bitchy daughter of a wealthy publisher. No, it's your character for my murder mystery dinner. Oh, by the way, it's set in 1883 not 1853, so you may have to adjust your costumes. But I know it's last minute, so I won't get all anal about it. Anyway, you guys psyched? I'll be psyched if you say "anal" again. Maya, about tonight, there's this Armani party... Oh, you're not gonna back out now. You agreed to this months ago. Well, no offense, Maya, but that's when we thought that asteroid was headed toward the Earth. Well, forgive me.

 I just thought, for once, instead of sitting around some vacuous party gossiping about the same old nothing, it would be nice to spend an evening doing something intellectual and stimulating. Hmm, intellectual and stimulating. I could read Shakespeare while you spank me. What? I'm a bastard. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Maya, I've been thinking about this, and I can't attend your party. I wish I could explain more, but I can't. Fine. All right, I'm dating Derek. Don't hate me. Who's Derek? Oh, believe me, if I could go back in time and change all of this, I would. Derek, the model? Oh, we only went out a couple of times two years ago. Here, bring him. Oh, I see. You just want to get him back into your nest so you can sink your claws into him. What? Maya, as my mother always said, "Stay away from my man." Oh, Dad, here's the cards for my murder mystery dinner for you and Allie. Oh, Allie can't make it. Why not? Maya, she gets embarrassed. Why? We're all gonna be in costume. No, embarrassed for you. Well, it's her loss. But you're still coming, right? You're the country preacher. Country preacher? I don't want to be some fruity preacher. Let Elliott do it. Hey, I'm the safari hunter. What? Him? I wanna be the safari hunter. You can't. You're having tea with the ladies' auxiliary. Hey, it just so happens once I stared directly into the steely eyes of a white tiger. Yeah, in Vegas, at Siegfried and Roy. Hey, working with those two guys, those cats can get pretty bitchy. Okay. So, we're gonna be there by 7:00, right? I don't know, Maya. Oh, come on, Elliott. It's gonna rock. Everyone from accounts payable is gonna be there. Oh, boy. Elliott... All right. The safari hunter will be there. Finch? Dude, I'm seriously not going. Friday night is date night, and there's always some chick that gets stood up at the bar. Bye, Maya. Everything's taken care of. I'll be over at 5:00 to set up. Okay, thanks, Megan. Hmm, who that? Oh, that's the caterer from the party. She's going to be dressed as the French chambermaid. Ooh la la, I'll be there. 8:00 sharp. (DOORBELL RINGS) Oh, our first guest is here! And it's... Glenn from accounts payable! Where're the rest of the guys? Oh, the new Quicken comes out tomorrow and they're camping out in front of Software City. Oh, that's too bad. (POUNDING ON THE WALL) MAN: Quiet out there! Oh, my stupid neighbor. Anyway, you're here, and your costume looks so authentic. Thanks. Although the buttons aren't real whalebone. Keep it on the Q.T.? (DOORBELL RINGS) Hello. Good eve, Sir Roger Prosper Beeks. I'm Dame Astrid Meecham McMarkle. Welcome to our peaceful country estate. MAN: Keep it down! Shut up! Oh, Sir Roger, this is Larry, our game coordinator. Is this phone working? I think so. I'll see. No, no, no! I left this number for my agent. He's supposed to call me as soon as he finds out if I got a part on this new soap. So, exactly how do we... Destiny's Children. It's supposed to be very good. They're using a lot of General Hospital people. Great. So... Acting on a soap isn't selling out, so get that holier-than-thou look off your face. No. That's not what... I'm just doing this to keep up my health care benefits and finish the work on my deviated septum. I lived hard in the '80s. It's a real mess in there. (DOORBELL RINGS) I'll be right back. Here we are! Hey, Finch, you look great. Yeah, I feel like Mr. Peanut. Dad, you were supposed to be the country preacher. (STUTTERING) I don't think so. What are you doing, Jack? I'm supposed to be the safari hunter. Oh, are you? There was so much confusion back at the office. There was no confusion! There you go again, talking in riddles. Hello there, fair maiden. I am Nigel, son of Lord Nidderdale. And a real bastard. I'm Jeanette, the indentured French chambermaid. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that for me? I'm Jeanette, the indentured French chambermaid. I... I'm sorry, one more time. Oh, Jeanette! Excuse me, my Lord. (STUTTERS) Banger? That's the plan. (DOORBELL RINGS) Hello, Maya. Oh, great, more trash. I knew bringing you was a bad idea. We'll leave. No, no, no, no. It's... It's my neighbor. He keeps putting his trash by my front door. Doctor Linus Von Pox, Grub Street physician. Nice to meet you, Doctor. Maya, it's me, Derek. Nice to see you again. Whoa, down girl. Let's get this thing over with, shall we? It's time, it's time. Yes, yes, yes. It is time for mystery, betrayal and revenge. Before this night is done, one person will be murdered and another will be revealed as the killer. It is truly a night to die for. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (TURNS OFF RECORDER) Ooh. Okay, who is the safari hunter? BOTH: I am. We can't have two safari hunters. Fine. You're the safari hunter. I'm the guy at the Armani party. Oh, come on, Elliott. We'll just get you another identity. All right, all I have left is the warden of an insane asylum. Fine, whatever. And you'll need your pistol. Ooh. Look, Jack, a pistol. Who cares? I'm the safari hunter. Let me hold it. Hold it. Stop, stop, stop. All right. Now this is very important. Every time you hear this bell ring... (BELL DINGS) you look at your next card. If you have something to reveal, read your card out loud. Listen closely to everyone's clues and try to solve the mystery if you dare. (TURNS ON RECORDER) (SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYS) Oops, I'm also a massage therapist. Okay, any questions? Yeah, how long do these things last? Oh, are you going to the Armani party? Yeah, everyone's gonna be there. What Armani party? I'll be meeting Allie there at 10:00. Can we get a ride? Hey, are you talking about the Armani party? What Armani party? Come on, you guys. This is gonna be better than some stupid industry party. This is a night of violence, betrayal and sexual intrigue. Have you ever been to an Armani party? All I'm saying is give it a chance. You might have a little fun. All right. Fine. But, you guys, you have to really get into it. This is the advanced version of the game, with lots of twists and turns. So it's not gonna work unless everyone here gets into character and stays in character the whole night. Okay? You know what? She's right. From here on in, I'm the warden of an insane asylum, Royster C. Hedgepeth. And I am Sir Roger Prosper Beeks. Safari hunter. And I am Fanny Chuzzlewit Sheets. And you are? I'm Jeanette, the indentured French chambermaid. Okay, shall we begin? MAYA: Let's! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) You arrive by horse-drawn carriage to the drawing room of Uppington Manor. (MIMICS HOOVES CLOMPING) It is 8:00 p.m. on a foggy night. (MIMICS FOGHORN BLOWING) It is Saturday, January 12, 1883... A thousand years after the death of the dinosaur. This was the time of wizards. You are gathered before dinner in the drawing room. There is a clap of thunder. (MIMICS THUNDER CLAPPING) Do you wanna do this? Sorry, I'm a little hopped up. I had a Yoo-hoo in the cab. A gust of wind blows out the candles. Suddenly, in the darkness... (PHONE RINGS) I'll get it! Give me some good news, Murray, I'm surrounded by idiots here. Oh, geez. Okay, I'll tell her. Your neighbor says he's calling the cops. God! I'll be right back. I'm sorry to break out of character for just one moment, but, I mean, who's having the best time ever? Professor Gladstone... Myra, will you stop all that noise? Why don't you go back to Puerto Rico? Professor Gladstone, if you would just listen... No, you listen! You are a mean lady. If you make any more noise, I am going to call the police. No, you listen! You are a mean guy! And I'm tired of you putting your garbage in front of my door. And I am tired of you telling me to be quiet. And I am tired of living next to you! MAYA: Professor Gladstone? Oh, my God. He's dead. Boy, this thing's pretty real. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) I can't believe he's dead. Good lord. Go in and tell everyone what happened. I'll call for help. You got it. Okay, everybody, the dead body's next door. Next door? He's supposed to be over here. Oh, never hire someone just 'cause you want to nail his sister. (PHONE RINGS) Out of my way! Talk to me, Murray, I'm dying here. Larry? Uh-huh. Yeah. Larry? Larry? Hold on. What? Although the telephone was invented by 1883, its use was restricted exclusively to commercial venues. We should disconnect it. Listen, if you ever try that again while I'm on the phone with my agent, I'll rip off your skull and use it as a prop in Hamlet. Which I will be doing this summer at the Westbury Music Fair. Everybody, I'm sure you've heard there's been a tragedy. My neighbor, Professor Gladstone, is dead. But please stay calm while I go downstairs to wait for the police. Can you handle things here for a few minutes? Yes, of course. Thank you. (BELL DINGS) You heard Dame Astrid. Turn your cards. Oh, me, me, me. "As a physician, "I am very eager to examine the body for signs of foul play." "As the warden of the insane asylum, I know this, "the last person to see this man alive "was Sir Roger, the safari hunter." "Sir Roger, the safari hunter." Where are we? Oh, for God's sake. Right here. "He's dead, he's dead." Oh. Right. "He's dead, he's dead!" Sorry, sorry, that's me. I've been poisoned! Muerte! Another dead body? Well, remember what Maya said. It's the advanced version. Twists and turns. "I have an alibi. "I was in the stables all afternoon, brushing my polo pony." "That's right. I was with him." You were? "Yes, we were making sweet angry love "while your father was hunting on the moors. "Perhaps later you can join me outside. "We can start a fire and be naughty." Well, as luck would have it, I just received a fresh delivery of wood. The police aren't here yet. I still can't believe it. One second he's fine, the next he's dead. "I just came back from Kenya where I learned hypnosis." What? "There is a secret door between Sir Roger's bedroom and the butler's pantry." "I'm addicted to morphine." This isn't part of the game. My neighbor's really dead. I need the phone! They heard what? Murray, I am not difficult to work with. Who said that? Oh, well, obviously the first beating didn't get through to him. So, what's up? I'm smoking. I'll say. So, why don't we forget whodunit and go home and do it? What are you talking about? I'm here to make your fantasy come true. Great. Try not to land on my car. What's going on, baby? You've been sending out signals ever since I got here. You didn't happen to notice that we were all playing parts and reading off the cards, did you? Oh, you can't fake our kind of chemistry. We're like magnets with privates. This is so demeaning. I never should have quit stripping. Hey, wait a minute, you're Misty Peaks. Oh God, you're that guy who always wants change for a dollar. ALL: Ooh. DENNIS: Ah, here we go. "Seeing death brings on such pain. "If only I had the sweet escape of morphine." Two bodies. Two bodies. What could that mean? Two bodies? I knew they were working in a new corpse. This job sucks. I'm going back to stripping. What... What are you doing? Why is he here? Don't touch him! (BELL DINGS) "I need to remove the victim's shoes "and examine them in my laboratory." No! "What's the matter, Dame Astrid? "Afraid we'll discover that you and the corpse share a common birthmark?" No! Derek, stop it! This is my neighbor, Professor Gladstone. Professor Gladstone. The one who put the garbage in front of your door? The one who annoyed you? Yes, yes. This is him. Looks like you have a motive. (ALL EXCLAIMING) No. I'm serious! He's really dead. (BELL DINGS) "Well, well, well. You sound like you have something to hide, "Dame Astrid Meecham McMarkle." I'm not Dame Astrid! That's right. You're really Fraulein Hilda Heiseldorf of Munich! ALL: Ahh. "Who once served time in my asylum for unspeakable acts of insanity." This is so great. I'm gonna black out. No! Stop it! This is not part of the dinner! No. Tonight, murder was the appetizer. That's not on a card, I made that up. (MAYA GROANS) Gadzooks, his pockets are full of crackers! It's all adding up. No, Derek, this is wrong. Oh, my God, stop. Listen to what she's saying. Oh, finally. This is wrong. Oh, I should never have stolen Derek from you. I mean, just look at him. You're perfect for each other. And they're still warm! MAYA: Oh, God! (BELL DINGS) Hey, there's the bell. What's your card say? "Oh, Nigel. I'm frightened, so very frightened. "Won't you push your head between my bosoms and comfort me?" How awkward. But if it says so on the card... (BELL DINGS) "And my buttocks, sir. They're so very cold. Won't you cup them?" Hey, who's making bogus cards on the laser printer? Oh, you bastard! I never claimed to be otherwise. Sergeant Fanning, NYPD. We got a call about a dead body. This way. Sergeant. Congratulations, that costume is hideous. All right, what happened here? (BELL DINGS) "I've been having an affair with the deceased for 12 years, "and I couldn't stand to lose him. "You knew, and you were jealous." "You whore! You accuse me of murder, "just because I perform grotesque experiments on poor lunatics? "You're the one who's killed before. "A world-class swimmer doesn't just drown in his own bidet!" What? "You've got a nerve, coming back here "after you shot my elephant, you fiend!" What are you, an idiot? Okay, everybody stop playing. This is not part of the game! All right, who's in charge here? Officer, Dr. Linus Von Pox. No! You, quiet. You, start talking. Thank you. I have tasted this man's warm crackers, and now I would like to take his shoes to my laboratory. Are you on drugs? Yes, sir. Morphine. Officer, I can explain everything if we can all just calm down. Ah! Screw show business! Screw this job! I swear I'm gonna murder my agent. Let me have my gun. Drop the gun! Get out of my way. I said drop it. Hey! Let me go! Hey, careful, man. So Larry did it. Wow, I did not see this coming. Maya, we owe you an apology. This was the greatest party ever. Okay, everybody listen very carefully. While I greatly appreciate the enthusiasm you all have displayed this evening, the murder mystery is over. This is a real cop. And Larry is in real pain. (LARRY GROANS) But most importantly, Professor Gladstone is actually dead! In real life! Real life! Is everybody with me? Does everybody finally understand? (BELL DINGS) "She's gone mad from syphilis!" (ALL AGREEING) (SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYING) You're on a deserted tropical island. You're lying all alone on a beautiful beach. Man, Larry, you sure got the touch. As a warm breeze caresses your face, you feel all your worries and cares slowly... (PHONE RINGS) Talk to me, Murray. I'm knee-deep in lard here.
