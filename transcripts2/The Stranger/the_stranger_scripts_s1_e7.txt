 Get out. I'm a policeman. I need the gun for work. - Right. - Actually, that's not true. It's my own personal gun. I am a cop. Right. So why are you hiding? I'm sorry? If you're there as her mate, why'd she tell you to hide? I don't know. She was scared. She thought it was her mom. She's a sick girl. She worries, you know? She panics easily. What's actually up with her? - Eh? - Her illness, what is it? Doctors don't know. I've taken her to so many specialists and they're all... baffled. - Only... - Only what? - Only what? - Well, I might have this wrong, but... I don't know, my mom suspected something, and then Olivia's mom snapped at her badly. Now my mom's gone missing, and I don't know... Slow down. What are you talking about? What do you mean, she suspected something? Well, I've seen for myself, there's poison. Poison? Olivia's mom put empty bottles of poison in the neighbor's bin. And I know it sounds crazy... What are you actually saying? My mom thought Olivia's mom... was making her ill on purpose. Hey. I need to talk with him if you think he's ready. Yeah, sure. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - I've got to go. - I'm sorry. It's better I know. - Wait. - There's a bus stop in the village. Shit. I can remember parts. It's all a bit hazy. You know? Anything you can remember will help. In any order. There was this party. In the field at Marsdale. A silent disco. Everyone was up for it. You know, there was... this feeling of... "Let's make this a big night." - Drugs? - Maybe. Just tell the truth. Whatever it is, Dante. Actually, it might be best if we can talk alone, if that's okay, just so we can speak freely. We'll just be outside, okay? Thank you. So, drugs? Some, but... mostly drink. So do you remember how you ended up naked? 'Cause I assume you were dressed at the party. There's this girl. Daisy Hoy. We got dancing together. I fancied her. She was kind of with someone else but... not really, so... I asked if she wanted to come take a walk with me. We went down the hill, and there's this lake, and it looked amazing. So I said to her... We should go in. It'll be freezing. You'll soon warm up. All right then. You go first. Tell me if it's cold. All right. Come on. Daisy? Yeah, ha ha, very funny. Why would she do that? I guess... I brought it on myself, really. You know, hitting on her... pretty hard. Maybe I pushed her to come. I supposed that was her way of saying, "Back off." So I'm walking through the forest, stark naked, trying to find her. Daisy? Wait! You got me into trouble! So who's Max Bonner? Some kind of caretaker. He works at the sports club, but he's... He's a weirdo. "You got me into trouble"? I reported him to Mrs. Price. I filmed him fiddling with the security cameras. Dante, we found footage you'd filmed of Mrs. Price, quite a lot of it, and now she's missing. Missing? Yeah. I... I don't know anything about that. I like her. That's all. It's a bit of a crush. I film lots of things. - It's what I do. - We're gonna need to see that footage. Because it might be significant. Yeah. So you've got no recollection of meeting anyone else after you ran away from Max Bonner? No. No one. Olivia? Liv? - Dad? - Liv. Come here. Come here. Come here. - Dad? - How could she do that to you? Okay. Everything's gonna be okay. There's gonna be no more sickness, there's gonna be no more pain. - What do you mean? - I know what's wrong with you, sweetheart. And we can make you better. I need you to pack a bag. You're gonna stay with your Auntie Carol for a few days. - What? Why? - Because... none of it's true. Your illness... it's a lie. - Your mother... - What are you saying, Dad? I've gotta sort a few things out, okay? Then you're gonna come stay with me. Trust me, you need to get out of this house. Now. Are you okay? He had a gun? He was a cop, but yeah. How big was it? It was about... It was a gun. What difference does it make? Yeah. You must've been terrified. I think we need to tell the school about Olivia. People have to know, so she definitely gets help. Yeah. Ah, very funny. You're a real prick. You know that, right? - It's not funny. - Yeah, it is. It's not. I wasn't a sporty kid. Were you? Yeah, very. Really? Yeah, really. Knock knock. He said you chased him and you yelled. Yelled? "You got me into trouble." 'Cause he did. I'd done nothing wrong. He made accusations. To Corinne Price? Yes, she's the... What's the word? Money person at the club. - "Treasurer." - Yes. He films things. He's always got a camera stuck to his hand and he filmed me. Said I was tampering with the security camera that overlooked the office. And were you? No, I was fixing it. Do you know Corinne Price is now missing? You have no knowledge of where she might be? No. Why would I? Right, so the night Dante was injured, you saw him and he was naked? Yes, naked boy. He said you had an axe. For wood. And it's not an axe, it's a splitting maul. What's that? Like a... small axe. So it was an axe, albeit small? Do you often go out chopping wood that time of night? I live on the edge of the woods. A lot of things happen in the woods at night. Max, I'm gonna have to ask you this: Did you attack Dante? Because he was found hours later at the bottom of the hill by the lake. I didn't attack him, I didn't. I didn't! I was getting wood! I know what you think of me. We don't think anything of you. It's the same as everyone else. I hear what they say about me. I did chase him. I chased him, but he was fast. Go on. He was running away... and I shouted after him. Wait! Wait! So you left him? I didn't know he was hurt, I swear. Is he all right? Is everything gonna be all right? Ryan? I love you, mate. I'm right here. Okay? Hi. I'm sorry for the late hour. That's okay. Do you wanna come in? I've had officers check CCTV at the airport, and it would appear that Corinne didn't take a flight. Right. Unless she somehow sourced a fake passport. She's not gonna do that. The boys are here, so... We've also checked your financial records, and there are no irregularities with your accounts. So that would suggest there's no money come from the sports club. She wouldn't. She loves that club. Ask anyone. You've been together for years, yeah? Yeah, we met at uni. You want one? Go on then. I was pissed in a bar, looking for a one-nighter and there she was. She had this laugh. Wicked sense of humor. She looked amazing. We ended up having a drunken snog but nothing came of it. But... ridiculous coincidence, which we of course decided was fate, we met again through a charity that took care of kids in disadvantaged parts of the world. Oh, pair of do-gooders. We volunteered for this mission in Johannesburg. But when we got there, there was this massive thunderstorm that washed all the road away and... somehow we ended up offering to share a room. I bet you did. That was the night that I knew... this was the real deal. We went back again for our honeymoon, just for a day, and... we were met with such... joy and love. We always said we'd go back again... with the boys. Sorry. No, don't be. I understand, trust me. I seem to be losing people who are close to me, so... I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. Sorry. Hey, mate. I heard voices. I thought it was Mom. Hi, I'm the detective... investigating the case. We'll do our best to find your mom, I promise. Bum got stung. Again. Gorgeous. ♪ We are the champions ♪ This is day four on the Price vacation. It's raining. What sound does a tiger make? Yeah. That's good. Shh, you'll wake him. Oh, he's awake. He's awake. The thing about, you know, teaching kids these days, if you give them an inch, they take a mile. No, that's not true. Throwing the grape into the mouth. Yeah! You're looking in the wrong direction. Look. Look at this. Look at this. Get off! Oh, Jesus! I know. You didn't have to stay with her, you know. This isn't what you think. There's more to this. You are so fucked in the head, do you know that, Leila? Do you realize the fucking psychological and physical damage that you've inflicted on your own flesh and blood? Do you realize? Is it 'cause of me? Is it 'cause I left you? I mean, is this some kind of sick revenge? Is that what it is? And you have no idea what I've done... for this family. You sick, evil bitch! Ah, there you are. Have you heard from Katz today? Maybe I was too hard on him. Maybe I overreacted. Hey, you all right? It's Heidi's memorial today. God. I'm sorry. I'd feel a bit better if we knew who did this to her. How can I look her family in the face? I think Phillip's right. I am too close to this. Hey, don't worry about that for now. Today just... be her friend. I'll keep working on the case from here. I'll go through the evidence from the night of her murder, see if there's anything I might've missed. Hug? Let's not get all American. Yeah. Hi. Sorry for arriving unannounced. This is a friend of mine. Hi. Peter Ince, private investigator. PI by name, PI by nature. What is this? - Well, your father told me... - I'm asking him. Peter's excellent. He's a corporate investigator. He helps me in a professional capacity, and I think he can help you with Corinne. You're paying him, are you? Talk to me like I'm a five-year-old. Just walk me through step-by-step exactly how this all started. Look, I really... Like a five-year-old. Trust me. Listen, I've already explained that the police are saying that Corinne's key fob was found at a murder scene, which doesn't add up. And she's been accused of stealing, which equally doesn't add up. All Peter needs to know is if there were any significant conversations that you had before she went missing. Mm-hmm, exactly that. I asked her if she faked her pregnancy. - Faked a pregnancy? - What? - Yeah. - How would she do that? She used a website where you can buy fake scans, fake bellies, whatever you like. Why would she do that? Because she wanted... to... I don't know... trick me into... staying or something. She thought I was having an affair. I was having an affair. Well, almost. Things had started to... What can I say? I'm an idiot. I take after my father. When was this fling? About two years ago. So this fake had happened a couple of years ago, right? Mm-hmm. - And you only challenged her now? - Yeah. She didn't deny it. We argued. She said that there was more to it. She said, "There's things that you don't know." Okay. Okay, so let's walk it back a step, yeah? You're saying that this fake had happened a couple of years ago? Mm-hmm. So why are you only fighting about it now? Because... Well, I would never have found out about it. I wish I never had found out about it. But this woman came to me at the sports club, this stranger, and just blurted it out. What did she look like? Twenties, mixed race, attractive. Shit. What? She came to me. What do you mean? Came to you saying what? - This is unbelievable. - Saying what? She told me I had another child. Just like that, she sits down. She says, "You have affairs, you have a child," and then, bang, up and out of the door. Wait. Look. Shit. It's the same. Yes. Who the hell is this? She didn't ask you for money? - No. - No. No. Are we being played? Is this some kind of set-up? - I think we need to find out who this is. - I saw her again yesterday. - Where? - At the hospital. I was visiting Killane. I told you Killane wanted you involved in the case. He does all sorts of paid investigating work. What if he was somehow involved with this woman? What if he was part of her bullshit? - How? - I don't know! Look, at his house he had all of this... surveillance equipment, like a homemade detective agency. - We need to visit him in hospital. - I've tried. The police won't let me in. You have to be family. His possessions, Killane's possessions... they're in storage. Where? My company has them. I have access. This is something that Heidi had... ...on the wall of her office in the bakery. And... it occurred to me when I saw it again that it perfectly captures... her spirit. It's called Inventory by Dorothy Parker. "Four be the things I am wiser to know: idleness, sorrow, a friend and a foe. Four be the things I'd been better without: love, curiosity, freckles and doubt. Three be the things I shall never attain: envy, content, and sufficient champagne. Three be the things I shall have till I die: laughter and hope and a sock in the eye. Thank you. - Do you want me to bend over, Larry? - Patrick... No, I'll bend over now, make it easier for you to screw me. - Now look... - Don't "now look" me. Don't use that tone of voice with me. You get ten percent of this business when it becomes a business. These women are gonna destroy all that. If you wanna look after your daughter, you need that money. - As it happens, my daughter... - Listen, you're in too deep. You killed someone. We have to stop them. Who the hell is that? Hi. Johanna. I was hoping we could have a chat. Of course, yeah. I mean, give me one... - You've gotta go now. You've gotta leave. - What? - It's a woman from work. - We haven't finished our meeting. Listen, message received, loud and clear. - So we're agreed? - Yes. - You're gonna clean up this mess. - Yes, I'll clean it up. Get out. There's a path around the side of the house. Don't let her see you. Come in. Sorry about that. Forgot I left the bath running. So I needed to... Can I get you something? No, I'm fine. Cup of tea? Yeah, okay. Uh, milk and sugar? Milk, no sugar, thanks. About yesterday, I know you weren't happy... No, I wasn't. Your actions sabotaged the whole operation. Yeah, I know, you said. I don't understand why you did what you did. I know, you said. If you've come to my house to bollock me... I haven't. - I came because I'm worried about you. - Oh, yeah, why is that? Have you looked in the mirror recently? Are you sleeping? I'm fine. No, you're not fine. Are you drinking? No. Look, I'm saying this as a friend. All right, as a colleague. How long have we known each other? Patrick, you're not all right. You are making errors, letting things slide, and it matters. In other jobs, you can coast, but what we do, it matters. Says the woman blubbing over her dead friend. Hey. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Look, you messed up the op. And you forgot to file a missing persons report on Corinne Price. I linked her to a murder scene. It was me that found the evidence directly connecting her to Heidi's Doyle's murder. Which is strange in itself because the café had already been searched by Scene of Crime. Those useless pricks. What? Well, they're not, are they? They couldn't find their own dicks, that Emmett guy, whatever his name is. Idiot. Why aren't you willing to accept that Corinne Price was involved? Instinct. School teacher, mother of two, and no connection whatsoever to the victim. So who did kill her, then? Look, you're right, you are. I'm not in a good place. I found out something. My daughter, and it's really... It's really knocked me for six. I'm sorry to hear that. I know she's not been well. Not well. Exactly. Sick kid. That's what you think, right? Katz, he's the one with the kid who's in and out of hospital the whole time. Well, process this: She's fine, she's not sick. It's her mother who's sick in the head. She's been poisoning Olivia. I mean, how can you do that to your own child? It's a syndrome thing, I've looked it up. It's called "Munchausen by proxy." She needs locking up. She's been twisting Olivia's mind to make her think there's something wrong with her while simultaneously pumping her full of rat poison. And all the time I've been stressed and I've been killing myself to try and find her the right treatment. And I've been earning extra money, doing extra hours, to pay for these specialists, and there's nothing wrong with her. There's nothing wrong with her. Mate, mate, I'm sorry. Come here. Come. I'm gonna sort it out. I'm gonna get her to come live with me. Yeah. Yeah, good. Shit! I'm sorry! Take it, it's fine. The infant... Hello? Jo, you're not gonna believe this. The night of Heidi's death, I found something. Let's hear it. - You'll wanna hear this. - What is it? So I'm viewing the CCTV from the area from the night of her murder. - We requested footage in a mile radius. - Yeah. I'm looking at the footage from the train station. And 20 minutes before her time of death, who gets off the train and walks in the direction of the café? Who? Katz. Do you hear me? Katz. Yeah, I heard you. Remember, the footage from the café got wiped. - He was the one in charge... - I'm actually with Katz now... I'm at his house! Jo? Patrick? We can talk about this. And say what? Open the door, Johanna. Tell me what happened. Open the door. We can talk about this. Did you kill Heidi? Things got out of hand, okay? I didn't mean to kill her, I promise you. She wouldn't tell me what I needed. It got out of hand. Why did you go there? How did you know her? I was trying to make things better for Olivia. Okay? I was just trying to be a good dad. That's all I was doing. Open the door! Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door! Shit. Fuck! Help! Oh, shit! Help! She's fine! Shut up! Patrick! No, you don't wanna do this. You're not this person. I think it's fair to say we're in a bit of a fix. Oh, my God. What? What? Adam, what is it? Chrissy? Dad.
