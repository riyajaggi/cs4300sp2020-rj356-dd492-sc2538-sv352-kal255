Your phone is off. - Look, man, I... - That's against State Police regulations. Look, man, we got a four-month-old baby. We're not getting any rest. I got to turn that phone off, man. They just fished a Jane Doe out of the bay in Provincetown. Gunshot. Man, did body side ask for us specifically? Drug side's gonna have a hand in all Cape Cod homicide investigations from now on. - Since when? - You didn't read the memo? Memo? What memo? Who wrote this memo? - Me.

You doing okay? Yeah. You got somebody to talk to about this? It's a traumatic event. [ scoffs ] I'm from New Bedford. You think I've never seen a dead body before? RAY: Hey, you Chief Schellenbach? Hi. Ray Abruzzo. This is Trooper Alan Saintille, State Police. - How you doing? - Yeah, I already talked to State Police. You guys are taking the case. No, you spoke with Homicide Unit. We're Narcotics, from up in Hyannis. We cover all of Cape Cod. We liaise between the body guys and the local PD, but we're not here to step on anybody's toes. Oh, hey, it's all yours. I-I don't need this shit. I got 60,000 people coming to town for Carnival. She been ID'd yet? No, nothing on her, and the fingerprints are waterlogged. [ indistinct radio chatter ] She's with the M.E. You moved the body before the scene was fully processed? There is no scene. Tide came and washed it away. JACKIE: I got pictures on my phone. RAY: Oh, yeah? Who are you? Jackie Quinones. I already... I already gave my statement to them. You want to give one to me? All right, um... I took a walk around 6:00, low tide. Saw something about 20 yards east to the sea wall over there. I approached, saw the girl. It was obvious she didn't need CPR, so I called it in to PMP, but the tide was rolling in fast, so I took photos. I'm in law enforcement... National Marine Fishery Service. Okay. You guys had some problems back in the day, right? Fishermen bringing in bales of weed right under your nose? Yeah, like, 40 years ago. Who do you work with, again? Cape Cod Interagency Narcotics Unit. Fancy. Y'all work with DEA? No, state, local, and sheriff's, mostly. But we'll take anybody. You looking for a job? [ both laugh ] That ain't funny. Look, call me if you think of anything else. Told you. Just here to liaise. [ somber music ] [ sighs ] Can I go now? Yeah. Take care of yourself. And, hey, Jack... let's take it easy at Carnival this year, huh? Yes, ma'am. ♪ [ indistinct radio chatter ] DEPUTY M.E.: Just want to point out, she is wearing a necklace that says "Lylas." Maybe a first name? Ah, fuck. ♪ Fuck. ♪ [ camera shutter clicks ] Frankie Cuevas. We don't know that. I know it. Where are you going? ♪ We rode together. ♪ What you looking at? [ sighs ] Nothing. Name is Sherry Henry, and it's "Love You Like a Sister," dumbass. ♪ [ groans ] FRED: Miss, honey, you look like who did it and ran. Not today, Fred. You know rent was due Wednesday. [ sighs ] I know. I'm sorry, all right? I am working on it. Do not tempt me, Jacqueline. I will Airbnb that shit, make a lot more money, too! [ melancholy music ] ♪ [ prison door buzzes, opens ] [ door closes ] [ prison door buzzes, opens ] [ door closes ] Hey, Frankie. Do you know who I am? You're a Statie. That's right. I was at your arraignment. I'm the one who put you in here. Oh, yeah? Good for you. Trial's coming up. How you feeling, huh? I'm feeling great, 'cause I didn't do nothing. No, no, you are my guy. Mm, you need decking, siding, or HVAC, I'm your guy. Beyond that... You do know your whole crew's going away, right? I mean, we got you on trafficking and distribution. You're looking at 15 years. But when you tack on the homicide, oh, it's a whole new deal. Juries don't like it when white girls get capped. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't fucking lie to me. You know Sherry Henry. Somebody fucked up, Frankie. We fished her out of the Bay this morning down in P-Town. You know, the thing is... when you dump a body, you got to slice them open first, or else they float. But in this case, I don't think that's what matters. The real problem is, the B-team fuckwads you work with... They don't know the difference between the ocean and the bay. [ chuckles ] Fuckwads. That's very funny. But I don't know that girl. Well, she knew you. She told me so much about you. ♪ How do you think we knew to search your cousin's storage shed? ♪ How's your baby mama holding up? - Renee? That her name? - Don't talk about Renee. I heard she likes her Oxys, but in this economy, she must be on the needle by now. Shut the fuck up. Just want you to know when you're doing 25 to life for trafficking, distribution, conspiracy to commit murder and DCF takes little Frankie Junior away because your woman's gone, that was because of me. [ slams table ] ♪ We're done here. ♪ [ ominous music ] ♪ [ whispering ] Watch out. Tide's coming in. [ gasps ] [ uneasy music ] ♪ VELEKEE: Get anything on the girl? Not much. We don't know where she died, or where she went into the water. Family was notified, such as it is. I mean, she mostly grew up in foster care. Someone spoke to an aunt. She hasn't seen her in years. Excuse me, Sergeant, where do you think you're going? Lieutenant? You go in half-cocked and question Frankie Cuevas about a body we just got? We don't know shit about shit yet, but, oh, why should that stop Ray Abruzzo? Look, it's my responsibility. Frankie had her killed for snitching to me. How would Frankie even know that she's a snitch? Maybe there's a leak in the unit. Tell me you did not just say that. Did he just say that? - He just said that. - RAY: I said maybe. Frankie Cuevas is in MSC, huh? Cousin Jorge is in Concord. We shut down the goddamn Dominicans. We shut down the white boys who bought from them. Who's left to pull the trigger? Somebody we don't know yet. Could be somebody new, somebody coming up. We never got his suppliers in New Bedford. Well, the DA just called, and she wants you to stay the fuck away from her case. Respectfully, sir, I think she should be thanking me. - How's that? - They dumped the body in the water. That means they didn't want her found, but she was found. So what's Frankie gonna do when he finds out his people fucked up? He's gonna get mad, and he's gonna get sloppy. He uses the phone. Prison phone's recorded. And those taped conversations are readily admissible in court. Fine, but you're Narcotics. Let the body side handle it. And don't waste a lot of time on this girl. You just lost a good CI. I suggest you find a new one.

Yeah, a little... and a little coke, but they don't really know about that. You're being charged with a DUI? Misdemeanor or felony? Um, they haven't charged me yet, so... But probably a felony. Do you think you have a drug and alcohol problem? JACKIE: No. No, I do not. I like to party a little, but... no. Then I'll ask you again why you're here. [ sighs ] Because the lawyer told me it was a good idea, all right? Keep me out of jail. LARKIN: Well, that's pretty good motivation to sober up. You think you can do it without treatment? Yeah. Yes, yeah, is that... Is that an option? Sure. Go. What? It's not my job to convince you to stay, and, frankly, my niece just got her learner's permit. I might actually prefer you go to prison. [ chuckles ] That's rude. It's rude to drive drunk. You know I found a dead body yesterday? LARKIN: No, I didn't know. Yeah. Some chick... she just washed up on the beach. Drug thing, I guess. It's like... damn, these white girls love trouble. [ laughing ] That was a scary, violent thing you saw. Why are you acting like you don't have feelings about it? Because I don't. Okay. Let's talk about the car accident. Was anyone hurt? [ chuckles ] You just dig right in, don't you? It wasn't a dig, but I'm sorry if it felt like one. You're not sorry. You're not fucking sorry. You want me to cry and tell you what a piece of shit I am or whatever. Isn't that how this works? No. We just talk. Fuck talking, all right? I don't need to talk because I'm fine. Jesus. I'm... I-I have an amazing life. I live in Provincetown, for crying out loud. It's like fucking lesbian Shangri-La, all right? I mean, so what? I like to party a little. Everyone does. But it's P-Town. In P-Town, you're either a fisherman or gay on vacation, and either way, they party, all right? Everyone parties. Everyone parties like me, so it's fine, okay? I'm fine. [ sniffles ] Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck. [ somber music ] [ sniffles ] Jesus, I don't... I'm not sure why I'm crying.
