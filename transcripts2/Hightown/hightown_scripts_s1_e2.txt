Maybe you got your shit figured out. I don't know. For me, the only shit I ever figured out was how to hustle and lie and break people's hearts. I mean, I'm a fucking dope fiend, and fentanyl fucking killed me. I mean, like, literally killed me a couple times. I'm... fucking lucky to be standing here right now, but I am. And, uh...

Hey, I'm Jackie. So, like, a week ago, I couldn't imagine not drinking or partying, right? Um... but now I realize that it was really messing with my life. And, like... [SIGHS] I'm cool being sober, you know? Still me, still having fun. It's all good. I don't really know why people think it's so hard. What do you have, like, eight days? Yeah, so? So what the fuck do you know? - Bethany... - [JACKIE LAUGHS] What is this bringing up for you? I don't appreciate her acting all high and mighty. This is my fifth treatment, and I'm only in here now 'cause drug court took pity on me. Otherwise I'm looking at real prison time. It's not my fault she keeps relapsing. - Excuse me, bitch? - Jackie, Bethany has a point. You may be on what we call a pink cloud. In early sobriety, we have energy, clarity. It feels so good and easy to be sober that we think it'll never be hard. But that feeling won't last forever unless you do the work. - I told you, bitch. - Call me bitch again, bitch. Right, what, what? Don't fuck with me! - [BLOW LANDS] - DR. LARKIN: David! David! - JACKIE: Get off of me! - BETHANY: Fucking with me, bitch! - JACKIE: Fuck you! - DAVID: Hey, hey!

Yeah, and I'd like to remind you of the no fraternization policy. You keep this thing up with Tina, you won't have a bed here either. Tina? What are you talking about? You don't think I know everything that goes on around here? I'd like us to start examining your relationship to women and sex. What? I love women and sex. Have you ever had a serious relationship? One, Devonne. [EXHALES HEAVILY] But we broke up, and now she hates me. Do you think your drinking played a part in that? No. Yes, okay, my drinking played a part in it. But it wasn't just that. I mean, I loved her, and I wanted to want the same stuff as her, like kids and a house, whatever. But I couldn't. I didn't mean to be a shithead. It just happened. Which I'm pretty sure is what my dad would say if you asked him. What's your dad like? He's an old-ass fisherman. Lost part of his finger on a tuna boat and still made his quota that day. Sounds like you admire him. Uh, yeah, I admire that part, I guess. Yeah. But he also, like, fucked over my mom and cheated on her a thousand times. Probably still does. Do you think you're like him? I'm nothing like him. But that's crazy, right? [CHUCKLES] Like, who's trying to fuck his nine-fingered old ass? - [LAUGHS] - I've noticed you make jokes when you're uncomfortable. Oh, yeah?

Uh, do you know a resident named Krista Collins? I can't discuss my other patients. Even if she's in trouble? What is this, Jackie? [SIGHS] I told you about the body on the beach, right? Well, I found something out, like... maybe Krista Collins had something to do with it, and I feel like I-I feel like I need to... look into that. What do you think? I think if you have information, you should call the police. Okay, well, hold-hold-hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What else do you think? I think you're a newly sober alcoholic looking for something to fix on and that this is an obsession of the mind, just like the big book talks about. Why does this always have to be about me being crazy? I mean, maybe I'm supposed to be doing this. Like, why me, you know? Why-why did I find that body? - Maybe my-my purpose... - I... - Is to save this girl. - That's very noble, but there's only one person you need to save, and it's not Krista Collins.
