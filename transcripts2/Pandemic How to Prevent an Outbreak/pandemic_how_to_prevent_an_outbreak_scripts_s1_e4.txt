 [reporter 1] The World Health Organization has finally declared the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo as an international health emergency. [reporter 2] A top United Nations official says there is a very high risk that Africa's latest Ebola outbreak will spread. [in French] The situation remains critical, with a special emphasis on Butembo. We have around five cases there. So we need to intervene there. But there were incidents.

 Violent attacks against the vaccination team. [reporter 3 in English] This is all that's left of a health clinic in North Kivu. A local militia burned it down and threatened the doctors. [reporter 4] Now, not only do they face exposure to this deadly virus, but often times health workers are suspected as the people who are introducing the virus into this country, so there is a lot of distrust. That is what is making things so very difficult. [man in French] The community's reluctance, in addition to the influence of certain armed groups, continues to affect the humanitarian response in a big way. The Organization for the African Revolution. For the second time, they have issued direct threats. Yesterday, we recorded five incidents.

 If we don't explain and associate with them, they will raise the population in revolt against the operation. Not being able to vaccinate is a worry. We must find a way. It's a crisis, we need to reflect on it. The status quo isn't good enough in our efforts to contain the outbreak. [car horn honks] [in English] Sometimes, I can feel a bit in danger. Mainly in the rural areas where you can have some armed group, we have to use security protective equipment or use the armored car. It's really scary. But we don't have the option of leaving. [child crying] [car horn honks] [car horn honking] [Syra Madad] Let's go ahead and get started. Uh, first, good morning and thank you everyone for joining today's flu update call. I want to make sure folks know flu season is still going strong. Uh, we are still at elevated and widespread levels. Um, so we'll give you that update momentarily, but I wanted to shift gears, um, and talk a little bit about the public health emergency that was declared for measles. [news anchor 1] The United States is battling one of its largest measles outbreaks in decades. 78 new cases in the last week alone. [news anchor 2] Health officials scramble to contain a disease eliminated in the US nearly two decades ago. [Madad] We have vaccines that have eradicated measles, but now you see a huge anti-vaxx movement that's promoting this misinformation and people are believing it. [protester] We know more about the vaccines than the doctors who inject them. [protesters cheering] Right now, we are in one of the largest outbreaks that we've seen in a number of years. [news anchor] The threat's so severe, some hospitals are arming each entrance with security guards to screen visitors for symptoms of the virus. [Madad] People are refusing these vaccines that work, 'cause people forget all the morbidity and mortality that we saw decades ago. We need funding to train our health care workers to identify and isolate cases of measles as they come up... but the proposed budget that the Trump administration came out with this past March does show a cut in funding to Health and Human Services, which includes the CDC. [Tom Frieden] The administration proposed a 20% cut in the CDC's budget just earlier this week. That would bring CDC's budget back to nearly 15, 20 years ago. This is not the way to protect Americans. It risks more cancer, more outbreaks, less safe Americans. [Madad] Finding the funds to do this work is a constant part of my job. [buzzer sounding] [Gustavo Rivera] Doctor. [Madad] Senator Rivera, how are you? - Pleasure meeting you. - Doing way frigging too much. - How you doing, doctor? - I'm doing great. Thank you so much. Thank you for sitting down. Ah... How can I help you this fine day, madam? All right, well, I wanted to talk to you a bit about the city's outbreaks that we're seeing, notably current, the measles outbreak, and then talk a bit about the funding we have, um, and the gap in terms of the current administration and the proposal that came out from President Trump's budget. - Can I ask a question about this? - Absolutely. Please. How does, since you are a professional, and not one of these folks that has been in here arguing that we have no such thing as an outbreak... How would you define an outbreak, and would you, in the current... I figure it's a rate of infection that goes above what's normal, I guess? Yep. And how far above normal is the one that we're currently going through? So, I think, just to put that in context, this is one of the worst outbreaks we've seen in decades. Largely, I think, really, we underestimated the movement of anti-vaxxers and just how influential they are. I think public health is doing a phenomenal job trying to vaccinate, get the public message out there, but you still have a lot of anti-vaxxers giving misinformation... I had one of them sitting right there... - Really? - A couple weeks ago. Yeah. They're... 'Cause they're pushing hard. And it just seems silly that we're even having a conversation right now. It's like... Certainly, it is your kid and it is your choice to have your kid un-vaccinated, but then you just can't have him or her around other kids. Yeah, I mean, the problem is getting out of the mentality, it's not just about you, it's about others, it's about your family, your friends, your neighbors, those who are immunocompromised. I think it's just a lot of unfortunate selfish mentality. [Rivera] Mmm-hmm. Um, we just need to maintain our readiness, but, unfortunately, with the federal funding coming to an end, um, and really no champion, if you will, that is at the federal level talking about these fundings that need to continue, we wanted to see what your feedback would be, um... - You want to ask for state money. - Yeah. Okay, so, 3.29 over five years. For five years. And that's 650K a year? - That's right... - Okay. - It's not a substantial number. - No. It's something I would consider seriously that we would actually take a very strong stand on, but we're talking about next year. You probably should touch base with me on this, by the end of the summer again. That's great to hear. You can certainly count on me as a supporter. Thank you. - I really appreciate it. - Absolutely. - Thank you. - Great to meet you, Dr. Madad. Thank you, Senator. - Hi, for Syra? - Yes. [Madad] Thanks. I'm constantly pursuing funding. This is not a... "I do it once and then I'm done." This is something that I know that we need to constantly work at. People forget this is something they need to pay attention to, and they need to be reminded. [Pete Ferryman] In the midst of the measles outbreak in the Northwest, Oregon lawmakers are considering a strict vaccine bill that would require more parents to immunize their kids. [Dinh] Without the required vaccines, students would actually not be allowed in schools. The Senate will hold its first hearing on House Bill 3063 tomorrow. We will, of course, continue to follow the bill. ...jelly. [children chuckle] [children giggling] [Caylan Wagar] It makes me sad that we live in a society where we cannot have difference of opinions. The kids can't even play with kids of their choice all because of a vaccine. Can you put... Can you mix that for me? - [child babbling] - Yes. [Wagar] You want to sprinkle my placenta capsules on that? - Give some good vitamin back in your body? - [child 1] Say what? [child 2] Got it! Tonight, I'm going to have a group of peaceful warriors and advocates come over and just talk about how this bill could potentially affect their life. [woman] I'm drawing energy down. Grounding down into the earth. Speak with empathy, with our open hearts and as the highest place in the circle. I had no idea that our representatives were pro-vaccine. If the bill passed, we would definitely consider moving out of state. So, it would be a really sad decision for us. The teachers at my school have been with my children for a total of ten years. That's a huge amount of time that we've committed to the education, to the community, and I really don't know what we will do, as far as education, if we don't have the opportunity to go back to the school that we've chosen for our children. [man] It can be very frustrating to hear that side where it's like, "I trust my doctor." Yeah, I trust my doctor. That doesn't mean I still don't ask my doctor questions, and my doctor is sometimes wrong. Thank you, everybody, for coming and just showing up and being real - 'cause it feeds my soul very well. Yeah. - [woman] Feels good. [Wagar] Things are progressing with this bill, but ultimately, I believe miracles can happen, so... [Susan Fils] Oh... It's going to be another long day. [sniffles] I kept thinking of that little one last night when I went to sleep, the one that said thank you with the tears. That bothered me so much. [chuckling] He tried so hard to be a big boy. [Fils] My mother, she was one of the very first people who helped with the AIDS. AIDS came out in New York and everybody was terrified of working with AIDS patients. They didn't want to touch them. My mom went in there and she was right there helping out, doing everything. And I think that's where I get it from. My husband gets mad about my doing all this volunteering because I did say I was only going to do two weekdays a week, but what else am I gonna do? Be sitting, you know, staring at the TV? [man in Spanish] How are you? [in high-pitched voice] Hi, sweetheart! How are you? Give me a hug. You did your part. We'll take care of you now. Come with me. Who is ready to eat? [all laugh] Everyone! You all want to eat? I want to eat, too! How's the food? Good, right? It's made with love. Everything is for you. Okay? [man continues indistinctly] [Fils in English] For about two weeks, we haven't had any vaccines at all. So that means there was hundreds and hundreds of people that we couldn't offer the vaccine to. They're just letting these children and families suffer because of our politics. There's no reason for it. It's being made. We just heard that the county approved a thousand more doses, not only for our use at the monastery, but also on the border. We get these from the health department. [Fils] Thank God. And this is really the end of vaccine season. So it's enough for this time of year. Are you sure? All done. - [man 1 in Spanish] Can you sit here? - There is plenty of space for shots here. [both laugh] [man 2 in English] I'm ready. [man 1] Uno, dos, tres. [Fils] I'm so happy to be able to give the flu shots again. No big deal. [babbles] Okay? [Ives] It's been a while since we've been down here, so we do have to rebuild some of the lab. About halfway into the first study, I realized that there's basically a million reasons that would have led to us seeing that the vaccine didn't work. We had lots of people working in a pig facility. [counting] When it's 85 degrees, and it's humid, and there's flies biting you, and there's pigs squealing, and you're getting peed on, and you're stepping in poop, and you have to wear earplugs, it's just a lot to handle. I was like, "Shit, there is a tremendous room for error here." Oone day, I talked to Jake, and said, "Look... the only way I could ensure the success of this project is if I took it over." Sarah has ruthless precision. Right away, I realized that she was gonna be the one who was just gonna charge this thing forward. [Ives] When I first came down to Guatemala, we only had an idea... [object rustling] but after this trip, we will be ready to publish our vaccine paper. [Glanville] For her, having a high-impact paper is going to be critical. Science is all about credibility. That's why we publish. And that's transformative. That changes you from being a spectator in science, in our generation, to being one of the people on the field that's playing the game. [pig squealing] [pig oinking] [indistinct conversation] [Ives] This would be my first... First authored paper. Because it's one thing to just talk about the vaccine, but once this paper comes out, we could actually move the needle on vaccine science. If this vaccine works in humans the way that we think it might, it could disrupt the zoonotic network between flus jumping from animals to humans, which we know is how the next pandemic is going to arise. [vehicle horns honking] [Aggarwal] We have a major proportion of the country who don't access health services properly. Other than proper doctors in our country, people have a lot of trust in quacks or people who are not very well-qualified to give medicine. [coughs] [indistinct chatter] [Vijay in Hindi] This camp happens every month. We will see at least four to five hundred patients. I go to a slum clinic on my weekends, because we find the most serious manifestations of swine flu in the most socio-economically poor areas. It's not that the flu attacks only the poor. It attacks the rich in the same way. The poor are not able to fight against it. [in English] Because of overcrowding, poor hygiene, lack of resources, and malnutrition. [in Hindi] There's no one to explain to them the severity of their disease. - [Aggarwal] You have a slight fever? - Yes. - Have you used a thermometer? - No. [Aggarwal in English] Somehow, even if people develop symptoms of swine flu, they tend to ignore it. Some of them are daily wagers. So, if they stop going for work, how will they support their family? So, they go out and they end up spreading the disease even more. Of the higher-risk patients, a very special group, yet neglected, is the group of pregnant females. [Vijay in Hindi] You've had nausea for the last three, four days, correct? You might have heard about swine flu in Jaipur. There's an outbreak A pregnant woman is highly prone to this disease. I will prescribe a medicine for you, but make sure to get the test done in a day or two. [Soni] I have a bad cough. - [Vijay] Anyone else coughing at home? - No. - No one at home has it? - No, and my cough is not going away. - The cough is not going away? - No, it is getting worse. [coughing] [Vijay] I am thinking that, Soni, since you are not getting any relief, I think you should go to SMS Hospital. - Which hospital? - SMS Hospital. The thing is you are pregnant, so we do not want to take any risks. We want to rule out swine flu as a possibility. - Should we go tomorrow? - [Vijay] If you go today, it is best. Okay, then. [woman] Is there reason to worry? [Vijay] We just need to be sure. I will arrange for the ambulance. Go and show yourself there. They will run tests for all your issues. And they can prescribe treatment as well. [Aggarwal in English] In the past, I came across a pregnant lady and she got infected with swine flu. Initially, they ignored. By the time she came to us, she was very, very ill. And despite trying everything, we lost the patient. So, it was very sad that, had they been a little more aware, two lives could have been saved. [ambulance siren wailing] [wailing continues] [Lee Beyer] Welcome everybody to the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Services. We're going to do a public hearing this morning on House Bill 3063. Senator Steiner Hayward is going to make a presentation on the bill. Senator Steiner Hayward. In essence, House Bill 3603 will require that children attending any school or licensed childcare facility receive a course of immunizations that are listed in 3603A. It will remove non-medical exemptions as a reason for not obtaining these immunizations. The intention is to protect children in licensed school settings and licensed state care settings. Thank you, doctor. [Steiner Hayward] I'm a board-certified family physician. I firmly believe that I have a responsibility as a legislator to promote good science, to promote what's in the best interest of the vast majority of Oregonians. I mean, this is a public health emergency. It truly is. [Beyer] We're gonna go to public hearing, and we're gonna give everybody two minutes to state your position on the bill and what you want us to know, people who have signed up for and against. [woman 1] I'm here to oppose House Bill 3063. I believe religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccination are imperative since a medical exemption is nearly impossible to obtain. [Steiner Hayward] Oregon has large groups of people inclined to vaccine hesitancy. [woman 2] The idea that the government thinks that they have any place to mandate toxic injections into our children's bodies is scary. The first is that dichotomy between purity and impurity and they see vaccines as this impure substance that we're putting into our bodies. [woman 3] HB 3063 lays the groundwork for government overreach, and the cost of that is our freedom. [Steiner Hayward] Oregonians tend to be pretty minimalist when it comes to the government. So, vaccine hesitancy found fertile ground here in Oregon, and for years, we've been seeing declining immunization rates. When I was a teenager, I received the exciting, new HPV vaccine Gardasil, and I had facial paralysis for three months as a 17-year-old girl. I have a family history of vaccine reactions to the MMR. I lost the ability to walk and talk and it took me four months to regain those skills. My son has microscopic colitis. He's had an endoscopy and colonoscopy at seven years old. He did not have a solid stool till he was eight. [Steiner Hayward] Correlation doesn't prove causation. It's absolutely true that people can have adverse reactions after vaccines. Some of them can be serious. Relatively few of the very serious ones are actually associated with the vaccines. Sixty years ago, autism was unknown, about one in 10,000. Today, African-American males are diagnosed one in 48. Nobody becomes autistic. They're autistic from birth, but the symptoms of autism start to become clear somewhere between 12 and 24 months, and children get their first MMR vaccine at 12 months. My doctor told me that getting the Tdap vaccine was the only way I could protect my unborn baby from pertussis. I had a hot, red, swollen arm for five or more weeks to show for it. These were the lasting effects that the adjuvant aluminum was having on my immune system. The amount of aluminum you get from a whole series of immunizations is less than if you cook an acidic thing like tomato sauce in an aluminum pan. My mom and dad deserve the respect to make choices that are best for my life. [Steiner Hayward] Measles cases are skyrocketing. And that's incredibly concerning. The disease itself is dangerous, but it turns out that it also induces what's called immune amnesia, which basically means your immune system forgets how to fight off anything else. Kids, in particular, who get measles are at much higher risk of dying of all sorts of other things. The idea that we're putting kids at risk this way for something that's completely preventable... We should have had measles eradicated from the world by now. [girl] After my round of chemotherapy for a year, I was scared to go to school. [woman 1] And as a mother with a child who is immunocompromised and fighting for her life, it frankly appalls me that anyone would risk her life further. I'm sure you've heard a lot of people here saying that their education is being held hostage. You know that's not true. They're still going to have educational opportunities available to them that are equitable to the ones that they are losing due to the choice that they are making. My daughter did not have a choice when she got cancer. The Children's Hospital is full of families like us who are terrified, who are fighting, and who are hearing their community say that their choices are more valuable than their lives, and I'm sorry, I just do not believe that. I do not believe that is democratic. [woman 2] Kai is nearing the end of his three-plus years of treatment for leukemia. When the recent measles outbreak started in Clark County, it created a new level of fear for our safety of our son and we went on lockdown. Kai stayed home from school and public places for fear that he would be exposed. And I just want to say this, every day, my husband and I wake up and face the fear that he may die from his cancer, and we have no choice in the gap of Kai's vaccinations and every day poses a new risk. The last time we spoke to the Senate committees, I was booed when I walked out because I asked to stop the philosophical and religious exemptions, and many of those who were angry with me had their children with them, like they are here today, and I don't have that luxury, and so the facts are, there's a 20-70% chance that immunocompromised kids will die from the measles, and that's just not a risk I'm willing to take. - [alarm beeping] - So, thank you for your time. [Beyer] We are out of time. I am going to close the public hearing. [gavel bangs] [Steiner Hayward] I don't count on bills passing until they're on the governor's desk, but the governor has assured me she'll sign this one. So, if it gets to the governor's desk, I'm pretty confident. I'm certainly much more confident than I was a few weeks ago that it will pass, and that we'll be able to protect Oregonians from preventable serious diseases. [Yao in French] Put on the gowns, please. [Yao in English] Ebola is a scary disease. My job is, uh, to ensure that if we have a case in a hospital, it will not spread, it will not affect the health workers. The body fluids are highly contagious. That includes blood, urine, feces, breast milk, even sweating. [man in French] You always have to go from top to bottom. Wash your hands between every movement. In the undressing room, there is also a mirror over there. So that you can see yourself and avoid touching yourself. When you touch this, you have to touch the side that didn't come into contact with the patient. Even though he disinfected it. You were in contact with him. [rain pattering] [speaking French] [Yao in French] Channels show a contamination across different health zones. So, we could have a positive case in Goma. So, are we in a position to effectively handle a positive case if it were to arise? Now, the biggest challenge is logistics. You know, just like me, that after Kinshasa, Goma is a city with a big population density. At this time, we only have one ambulance! Only one! Personnel training. That's very, very crucial. We often notice a lot of professional mistakes. If a case where the mistake was made was to be positive, it would be a catastrophe. So, to the question asking whether we have a positive case, and can you manage? I can honestly say, "No." It would be unmanageable. It would be a disaster. [Ives] I began working at Distributed Bio about three years ago, and my very first day, I flew to Guatemala. It was really exciting. I had never been outside of the country before. It's just... It's so different from where I grew up in, like, suburbia Midwest. I didn't really know I wanted to be a scientist. When I was starting college, I was debating between majoring in biology or music. I've always loved being on stage. I'm not the greatest singer, the greatest actor or musician. I'm not the greatest gymnast, I'm not the greatest performer, but I love being on stage, and I think that's kind of propelled me to try to be really good at something that I like, and in this case, it's science. I really fell in love with research. I studied genetics at University of Wisconsin. I got my masters in biotechnology from the University of San Francisco. I thought that going into scientific research, it would be relatively mundane, but what I found is that, it's quite the opposite of that. I have this crazy job where I'm being paid to travel to Guatemala and make real advancements towards human health and medicine. Now, every time I come back, it's like a homecoming. [lighter clicks] Do you, like, ever smoke a cigar if you're not with me? - Mmm. - Ah. Once a year or something, or... Kind of ritually when something good happens, or I don't like writing grants. If I need to kind of let go, walk and think for a little bit. [indistinct chatter] [Glanville] My parents are American hippie ex-pats. They were building a hotel in the '70s, and they finished building it right before I was born. My mother was always cracking the whip to be like, "No, no, you go to college," because she never got to. My dad, he was always like, "Do whatever you want, just have good opportunities." My mother was like, "Get your PhD." Because of the tireless support of my parents, I had opportunities to grow. [indistinct chatter] - Salud. Mmm. - Speaking of which, cheers. [Glanville's dad smacks lips] Hm, Martell. Back to just that... There were no embarrassing stories about you when you were little. They were very flattering. I thought all fathers probably think their firstborn is just brilliant and smart, and I've seen people brag about kids - that weren't that smart. - [chuckles] Jake was really smart. I didn't talk baby talk to him since he was about two. And in... When you went to the first grade, your teacher had a meeting with me. She said, "I've been teaching for 30 years and he's the smartest kid I've ever had. He's a genius. Do you know that?" And I said, "I thought he was smart, but I didn't know about 'genius.'" When you were four, you asked me where babies came from and I said, "Well, the stork brings them." And you said, "What kind of a pervert fucks a bird?" - What? - [both laugh] No, that's a joke. You didn't really say that. What? [both laughing] But, uh, anyway, I thought it was kind of interesting that we came down here when you were, well... - You would have been... - Seven or eight. [Glanville's dad] Nine. Well, it was 1990, so, yeah... [Glanville] I don't think I realized what it was like to grow up here until I got back to the States when I was 16. So, I had an experience that is not the same as many first-worlders, in that I grew up in a community where people were sick all the time with a bunch of things that they shouldn't be sick with anymore. And some of them died. None of these kids had to get sick in the first place, but many of them did not have access to medicines or vaccines that could have saved them. That has really affected me in our mission to not only create a broad-spectrum vaccine, but to make sure that it's available to everyone, including the people in the developing world. That's actually written in our founding documents of Centivax that we will always give this away at cost in the developing world, ensuring that as many people as possible have access to it. Tomorrow, we are going to start one of the most important steps yet in making that a reality. [ambulance siren wailing] [car horns honking] [Vijay in Hindi] In India, health services are provided by both the government and private sources. SMS is the largest government hospital in Rajasthan. Whether it's flu or any illness, the only savior for the poor is SMS Hospital. - [doctor] What's your name? - [hoarsely] Soni. [doctor] So, you're Soni. How long has your voice been lost? [Soni] For five to seven days. How many months pregnant are you? I will start the seventh month on the 20th. [doctor] Your condition is a bit serious, okay? We will admit you here to keep you under observation. [Soni] But they said they will only check me. [doctor] They will check and keep you for a few days. Don't be nervous. [Soni] What is wrong with me? You have breathing problems, and we think the pneumonia in your lungs could be due to swine flu. We will check for that, okay? There's no need to be scared. [Soni coughs] [Raman Sharma] At SMS Hospital, we are dealing with lots of cases. We usually on an average see about 1,000 patients per day. [Vijay in Hindi] The workload in SMS is too much. The doctors in SMS Hospital are very capable, but resources are limited. [woman] This is the bed. [Vijay] Those people have no choice but SMS. [Sharma in English] We do get patients from other districts, and usually these hospitalized patients are in a critical state as far as swine flu is concerned. Because of the long distances, sometimes, there is a time lag between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization. Our aim is to treat the patient as early as possible. [doctor in Hindi] Stick your tongue out. [Sharma in English] That's why the government is doing efforts to make this swine flu test free of cost. [boys chattering] [Fils] Buh-bye. Let me try to get some helpers. Can you help me? Today is my last day at the monastery. Baseball caps... My husband, he wants to see his grandchildren, and I want to see mine in North Carolina. So, it's time... Time to go home. [woman speaking Spanish] [Fils] I got for everybody. I hit yard sales like you wouldn't believe this weekend. Gracias. Thank you so much for all the help. I've met some of the sweetest, nicest people. Even though the asylum seekers were only there for a couple of days, I got really attached to many of them. [laughing] [news anchor 1] The border patrol's largest migrant processing center is closed for now over fears of a potentially deadly flu outbreak. [news anchor 2] Late last night, the border patrol stopped taking in new migrants at their McAllen, Texas processing center, after 32 migrants already in custody were diagnosed with the flu. [news anchor 3] A 16-year-old from Guatemala, Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, died on Monday after coming down with the flu. He had recently been processed at that facility in McAllen, Texas. [news anchor 4] He is the fifth underage migrant taken into custody to die since December. Some members of Congress want answers about the growing number of deaths among the 16,000 people in Border Patrol custody. [news anchor 5] Prior to the Trump administration, CBP had not had a child die on their watch for over a decade. [news anchor 6] As far as what's being done in the future, we have no idea. So, I guess I have to give the baby back? I can't come up with any other... Okay. [laughs] Oh... Here, Mama. These people are desperate. No matter what happens, they're going to try coming here. They are scared. They're scared their children are going to be taken into gangs and used for prostitution or used in whatever. They can't make a living. They have to come here. I'm afraid with the way the current policies are set up, we're going to have even more tragedies, even more deaths at the border, because these people are desperate. Give them, everybody. - [woman] Everybody? - Yeah, everybody, okay? Okay. I'm going to miss this so much. It's the greatest experience I've had in years. I'm the lucky one. I'm lucky I get to do this with these kids. I'm coming, dear. [sniffles] Ah... Maybe next winter, I hope not, but maybe next winter, this will all still be going on and we can come back and help some more, you know, help again. And this time, hit the ground running and not have to have the learning curve of how to give shots again. But it's hard to leave when there's people that need stuff. [child] Oh... [Yao] This is my second outbreak back-to-back. And this kind of outbreak lasts longer. Uh-oh. [switches click] I have no lights. I have a very bright flashlight, if you want? [both chuckle] [Sam Boland] There are a huge number of personal sacrifices that people make. We both came prepared. [laughs] Michel has not seen his wife or his children in months. And that is an exceptional sacrifice. It's something we try not to talk about too much, because it really weighs heavily on him. - [in French] Hi, Dad! - Yes. How are you? - Good, and you? - Yes, I'm okay. What are you doing? I'm eating. What are you eating today? Michelle cooked beef ribs. Yes. You're missing out, Dad. We ate really well. [in English] So, you can't send some through the telephone? [laughs] You miss them, and you are missing a part of their life. [in French] How's Ebola? [Yao] It's still difficult, but we're working hard against it. [Yao's wife] You look tired. Yes, I'm a little tired. It's been a long day. [in English] Sometimes, you're tired, so you say, "Okay, maybe somebody else can come and help." [in French] Graduation is on May 16. So parents are expected on May 16? Yes, that's right. Mmm-hmm. Okay. But I don't know if I'll have enough time. Okay. [in English] I was proposing actually to quit. But I witnessed a lady that survived, and it was a really amazing thing. A kind of joy and happiness to be alive. These kind of small successes give you more strength to continue. [doctor in Hindi] Yesterday, we ran some tests. A sample from your throat. There is the disease swine flu that could pose a threat to mother and child. There is nothing to worry about. You tested negative for swine flu. You have a regular cough and cold and a minor case of pneumonia, which we will treat with regular medication. So she is out of danger? [doctor] Yes, she is absolutely fine. Everything is under control. [imperceptible conversation] [Vijay in Hindi] The swine flu patients are still coming. There are too many patients and too few doctors. If there is an epidemic, then India's health system is ready, if all the private and government hospitals come together. And we should treat it as a global emergency. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. - Hi, dear boy. - You smell good. Hi, sweetheart. [Wagar] So, I'm really excited that Uriah just got back from camp. Said it was the best trip ever and now that this bill didn't pass, you know that your other kids look like they'll be able to do this as well. [woman] Yeah, I'm really excited about that. The holdout by Republicans in the Oregon legislature has resulted in the shelving of a mandate requiring vaccines. [reporter 1] The Senate Republicans left the Capitol, stalling the business of the Senate. To get them back, Democrats agreed to kill the vaccine exemptions bill. That bill died, but we are not done with the fight. [woman] Its going to come back around again because it's a sleeping bill and it's gonna be brought back in a big, big way on a federal level. I'm putting on spiritual armor again. Here we go again, we're going into the next round of battle to make a big difference. Yep, our voice, once again, comes back down to, if you have it, use it. [woman] Yep. I'm darned upset and disappointed and surprised... Um... and pretty ticked off. Crackpot theories are presented as if they have equal validity to good science and they can overwhelm the available good science information if you've got enough people who are willing to propagate them. The World Health Organization says that vaccine hesitancy is one of the top ten health threats in the entire world. In 2000, we declared measles eradicated in the United States, and we are well on track to have over 2,000 cases in the United States this year. That's just horrifying. [imperceptible] Most of the people in the state believe this is the right thing to do. One of the things you learn in this business is, "Live to fight another day." And we just have to figure out the right way to do it. It's kind of that simple.
