 Case Histories (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 1 - Case Histories, Part 1 - full transcript 
 Divorced ex-policeman Jackson Brodie works a a private eye on largely mundane cases until,by chance,he meets sisters Amelia and Julia Land. They ask him to look into the disappearance of their little sister Olivia thirty years earlier now that her favourite toy has surfaced in the belongings of their late father. At the same time agitated lawyer Theo Wynne,impatient at police lack of progress,has him investigate the recent murder of his teen-aged daughter Laura at his office. With reluctant help from ex-colleague Louise Jackson learns that Laura's teacher Jessup made a pass at her but he had an alibi. Her boyfriend Josh,however,recalls that she had another,jealous admirer though Theo refuses to believe it of his little girl. Jackson is then picked up in a bar by Shirley,who asks his help in finding her missing niece Tanya. All these circumstances remind him of the murder of his sister years ago when he was a young boy.

 I'm fine, thanks. How are you? 'Are you out and about?' I'm not out and about, I'm working. What do you want? 'Binky Rain phoned. She wants to see you. 'I said you were too busy doing jobs that actually pay. 'Bye, now'. 'Est-ce que le ciel est bleu?' Non, le ciel n'est pas sodding bleu. Binky, you can't call a cat that. It's not named after a black man. It's Captain Scott's cat on the Discovery. It's still not all right. They always take the black ones first. They turn them into gloves. Black gloves. Are you sure it's missing? How can you possibly tell? Please, Mr Brodie, go and find him. Please. I will. That's all I ask.

 Who fancies a drink? Julia, you've just had breakfast. And that's Victor's best wine. He doesn't need it any more, does he? What are we going to do with Daddy? Burial or cremation? Burn the bugger. OK. Come on. Show yourself. ..Oh, come on, you. CAT YOWLS Are you hurting my babies, Mr Brodie? Would I ever? It's quite a nice room, really. Naughty Daddy. Oh, God! How horrible. It's been 20 years since Mummy died. The poor man's allowed the odd wank. Don't be disgusting, Julia. Talking of sex, how's Henry these days? I'm not rising to your bait, Julia. Blue mouse. Get off me! Get off me! Amelia! Amelia! Is everything OK? Who the hell are you? Our father died two days ago. I'm very sorry for your loss. Don't be. We were both delighted. Blue mouse... The blue mouse. Um, let's just recap, shall we, for a second? Your father died, you're here clearing out the old family home? Well, yes. It's just, that sounds so warm, "old family home". Didn't mean anything by it. Remove the emotional significance, shall we? Couple of adjectives and a noun. Old. Family. Home. True or false? True. Strictly speaking, "family" isn't an adjective. Familial would be the adjective. Right. And, er... the blue mouse? BOO! GIRL SCREAMS It was a long, hot summer. Mummy had all these ludicrous little rules. Trying to keep the lid on our chaos. Olivia. Mummy's favourite. She was everybody's favourite. Hello. Shall I give blue mouse a kiss? Come on! Come and play! Go on, then. But put your slippers on. Why mention the slippers? What? You remembered the detail of the slippers. Why? They were never found either. Mummy wasn't a bad person. Just not a very good mother. She simply couldn't cope. What about your father? Daddy was once a promising mathematician. He preferred numbers to his family. Why aren't you in bed? It's too hot in our room. Can I sleep in the tent with Olivia? No, you can't. It's bad enough you look like gypsies, without living like them. Please, Mummy, please? She was so perfect. So peaceful. We never saw Olivia again. We've looked everywhere! She has her little rabbit slippers on! Please, you have to go find her! Please! This is the first time we've seen blue mouse since Olivia went missing. Well, you'll have to tell all this to the police. I think fate brought you to us, Mr Brodie, don't you think? Er, not really. I don't believe in fate. I think you do. Look, I've got to be honest with you, OK? With a case like this, the first 24 hours are the most critical. And the first 24 hours were over 30 years ago. There's really no chance of finding anything out. Won't you just come and look in the garden and the alleyway? The man's not interested, Julia. Let him go. Yum. Julia. BINKY: My beauties! Oh! Mr Brodie. What are you still doing here? Looking for your cat, obviously, Binky. It's my life's work. Listen, can I ask you something? The little girl, Olivia Land, that went missing next door about 30 years ago? Do you remember that? Oh, those girls, they were so wild. The night she went missing, Olivia, did you hear anything, see anybody? Anything unusual? They even came and questioned me. Well, I gave them short shrift. Do you know, those girls used to break into my garden and steal my flowers. That stopped as soon as the little one disappeared. Every cloud has a silver lining, eh? Mr Brodie. She's our lost sister, Mr Brodie. Misha! There you are. I want you to print out everything you can on Olivia Land. She went missing in Edinburgh in 1981. You mean she's actually not a cat? Mr Andrews phoned, wants to know if you found out anything on his slutty wife? Not his exact words. Did Mrs Rain pay her invoice? Not as such. You've been looking for her imaginary stolen cats for a month. She's never paid you a penny. Remind me, Debbie, when you run the business, to ask your opinion. Just as long as you've got enough money to pay me at the end of the month, that's all I care about. And it's Deborah. Deborah. Olivia Land, when you can spare a minute. Jackson Brodie, private detective. Deborah speaking, how can I help you? Theo Wyre. Laura Wyre's father, right? The case is getting cold. It's been months since she died, and they've run out of ideas. I'm sure that's not true, Mr Wyre... I want you to work for me. There's an ongoing police investigation, Mr Wyre. I've got to wait till it runs its course. My daughter was murdered, Mr Brodie. A man walked in off the street and slaughtered her in broad daylight. I'm truly sorry for what happened... You're not a police officer any longer. You're free to help me. I beg you... Mr Wyre. I can't take the case. My mistake. Niamh! Niamh! Niamh! Niamh! Niamh? Niamh? Niamh...? Niamh? MUSIC PLAYS PHONE RINGS Jackson Brodie. No, I'm not smoking. And it's nothing to do with you any more anyway, is it? Marlee? Yeah, sure. Why, where are you going? Solicitor? I thought we were done with all that. All right. I'll be there. You like him, don't you? Jackson. No, I don't. Yes, you do. That's why you were so antagonistic towards him. I'm antagonistic towards everyone. Anyway, you like him too. I do. There's something very attractive about Mr Brodie. Are you sure Olivia had blue mouse with her in the tent that night? Of course. She always had blue mouse. It's just... if it wasn't with her, we might be barking up the wrong tree. It was with her. Then how did it get in Daddy's drawer? I don't know. Maybe we should let sleeping dogs lie, Amelia. She's not a dog, she's our sister! Amelia, what's the matter? I was only asking... It was my fault! I should have looked after her. I wasn't suggesting that. She's coming back, Julia. Mr Brodie will find her. I'm sorry, Mr Brodie. I'm afraid I won't take no for an answer. How did you find out where I lived? I have to know who killed my daughter. Laura, I'm so sorry I can't be there on your first morning. I'll be fine. Cheryl will show you the ropes. I should be back from my clients round about lunchtime. Maybe we can go out? That'd be nice. Have you got your inhaler? Yes. Good luck at work. Any questions, just ask. Love you, Dad. I love you too, sweetheart. 'She was my little girl.' Only a few months go, she had her whole life to look forward to. 'I wanted to get back to the office to settle her in'. Why weren't you back in time? 'Stupid train hit a flock of sheep. Otherwise, I would have been there, and she'd still be alive'. How long's it going to take? What's happened? Where's the ambulance? It's all right, Laura. Daddy's here. That's what makes it so hard. It should have been me. She had a place waiting for her at Aberdeen University to study marine biology. She just wanted a year in my office, earn some money. Here. Theo, where did you get this? You're not meant to have these. I'm a lawyer. I have a few contacts. The police have conducted a full investigation. No leads. Not one. And what makes you think I can do any better? A man walked into my offices wearing a yellow golfing sweater. A sweater, just like this. Then he asked for me by name. He killed my daughter, and then walked out again. Theo... Somehow, something has been missed. I want you to find it. Please. Show me her room. This way. I've tidied a little, but it's exactly as she left it that morning. ♪ My father could use a little mercy now ♪ The fruits of his labour... ♪ Girls. ♪ Fall and rot slowly on the ground ♪ His work is almost over ♪ It won't be long and he won't be around ♪ I love my father ♪ He could use some mercy now ♪ Every single one of us ♪ Could use some mercy now ♪ Every single one of us ♪ Could use some mercy now. ♪ How are we doing on the Land files? I need the whereabouts for every statement-giver still alive. Er, no can do. I'm off home. It's a bit early, isn't it? Au contraire. I've worked seven minutes' overtime. It's my half-day. Shit! Lock up! Er, that's not in my job description. It is now! Dad! Hey! Blimey, that's a short skirt - don't you want to wear tights? Nope. Did you say thank you? Yep. Ooh. I've got a big fibber for a daughter. No, Dad, I'm not. Yes, you know how I know? Basic interrogation fact - people, when they're remembering, look up to the left, and when they're inventing, look up to the right - and guess where you looked? Sit in the front, and don't tell your mum. That's right - my wife left me, daughter dresses like a prostitute. Pierre est derriere le bonhomme de neige. Peter is behind the snowman? Tres bon. If we're ever in France, we meet someone called Peter and it... snows and he builds a snowman and hides behind it, we're laughing. Why do you always listen to sad music? Hey, hey! I like that. When you drive, you choose the music, all right? How's your mum? Good. Is she getting out and about? Making friends? Mmm. Who's this? Her name's Laura. Is she missing? Er, no. She's dead. I'm trying to find out why. That's sad. Did someone kill her? I'm afraid so. You'll find out why, Dad. Wow! Wow. You're sure you don't mind? Is this the place where she died? Yeah, but there's nothing scary here. Promise I won't be long. You draw me a nice picture, OK? Where was she standing - Laura? Over there - by the filing cupboard. What did he look like? I told the police 100 times. Tell me, one last time. Just ordinary. An ordinary man in a yellow sweater. He walks out here... Mm-hmm. I told you, Mr Wyre isn't here, he's gone to a meeting in Glasgow! It stained the carpet. You followed him in here? That's when I saw him attacking Mr Holroyd. I didn't know he'd also cut Laura with his knife. Why did Laura come in here? What do you mean? Well, first day on the job, man pushes in, nothing to do with her, you were on the case...? I don't know. What was she like? I didn't really know her. No, but you must have formed some impression - I mean, extrovert, noisy, loud, quiet... Quiet. A bit shy, if anything. Bit shy. Yet she comes running over here, bursts in after a stranger... Dad, is that blood? It's probably best if you don't mention... Mum! Hi! Did you have a good time? Yeah. We went to where the dead girl was murdered. There was blood and everything. All right, all right. Bye, Dad. On you go. Dead girl? How was the solicitor? What dead girl? What have you been doing? Nothing. It's a case I'm working on, she didn't see anything. See you later, Jackson. I thought we were done with solicitors. Yeah, we were, but something came up. What could come up? I agreed to everything. Nothing, just... I'm going to put her to bed, OK? Can I read her a story? Come on, you know that can't happen. I'm sorry. Yeah. You've got a nerve, coming back here. Wanker. Evening(!) Well, what do you expect? Two of their colleagues are suspended because of you. I don't give a shit. There was a rapist loose in the city. He's not loose any more. I've got a theory about you, Jackson. Oh, aye - you think about me a lot, do you? You're so desperate to belong, but there's something in your character which will never let you do that. So, Theo Wyre says you're not getting anywhere. You stick your fingers into Laura Wyre's murder, I will chop them off, do you understand? I'm still on that case, it's still a hot case. Getting cooler by the day, he says. See all this? This is Theo Wyre's entire case load for the last 30 years. The killer's in here, somewhere, but it's going to take time. Let me save you time, help you out... come on. How do you know the killer was after Theo? He asked for him by name. Who's this with Laura? Emma Drake, school friend. Can I borrow it? No! Well, give me something, what was she like? Laura? Secret life, lovers? I'm serious, Jackson, you stay away from this case. I'm just trying to help out. You know I'd never make you look bad, don't you? So, I spoke to the detective in Leeds that you asked me about. Why did he stop returning my calls? Because you're persona non grata, in case you hadn't noticed? It turns out this prisoner has been mouthing off that he killed your sister. Name of? That's all I know. I've asked him to go to the prison and talk to the guy, see if there's anything in it. Just don't get your hopes up, Jackson, it was a long time ago... You can't smoke in here - since when did you smoke, anyway?! Relapse. 15 years. Come on, I'll buy you dinner. I'm not interested in your wife's leftovers. Now sod off, please, I'm going home. Oh, erm... Olivia Land. Disappeared 30 years ago. I just need a quick peek at her files. No, you can't. What on earth are you interested in that for? Collecting lost girls? You know you're going to make yourself sick again. I wasn't sick. Come on. Oh, OK. All right, er... The Land girls, right, there was... Olivia, Amelia... Julia - their father died a few days ago... And Sylvia. Who? You didn't know? A few years after Olivia disappeared, Sylvia entered into a convent. And there's you thinking you know everything. Why is there nobody here? Because we didn't tell anyone. When exactly were you going to tell me about Sylvia? You look very good in a suit, Mr Brodie. I can't help you if you don't help me. Oh, don't be a crosspatch. Sylvia doesn't know anything, she's been incarcerated in that convent most of her life. Does she know her father's dead? Of course she does, she's our sister. Does she know you found blue mouse? No, we found blue mouse after we'd told her about Daddy. Er, is that it? No vicar? Sorry, did you want one? It's not illegal - we checked. Come on. If you were a dog, Mr Brodie, what sort of dog would you be? I don't know. Amuse us. A labrador. No! Absolutely not! So, how old was Sylvia when she became a nun? I think Mr Brodie is... an English pointer. How old? She was just about to go to university to study mathematics. Victor was furious. Sylvia had an amazing imagination. She convinced us Binky was a witch - do you remember? Mmm. We used to dare each other to go into her garden. When did she first get interested in religion? Sylvia was always talking to God, even before Olivia was taken. And Joan of Arc. She was obsessed with bloody Joan of Arc. Are you close? I write to her once in a while. I visit her. Only when you're auditioning for a part in The Sound Of Music. I'm an actress, Mr Brodie. I think Mr Brodie's worked that out for himself. A German shepherd! He'd pull us out of a burning house, wouldn't you, Mr Brodie? I'd like to think so. Listen, why do you think your father had blue mouse? That's why we hired you, Mr Brodie. Did he ever abuse you - sexually? He tried to put his hand down my knickers when he was attempting to explain fractions. I screamed the house down and he stopped. Never tried again. Amelia? And what about Sylvia? Don't know. OK. Come on, Julia, let's go shopping. Thank you for coming to the funeral. Can you help me? What do you want me to do? I don't know. All right, hold on right there, I'll be back. Theo... Jackson - you have something for me? It's just a question. Can you lend us a...? This girl... Emma Drake - Laura's best friend. What can you tell me about her? Well, nothing much. Lovely girl, around the house a lot. Where is she now? Well, she's still around. She phones me every week to see if I'm still OK. Do you think it's possible, Theo, that Laura might have known her killer? I always kept my work and Laura completely separate. What if the murderer was not to do with your work? What if he was, er... from your family - or a friend? I've known Holroyd and Cheryl for 20 years... there's nobody that I know that they wouldn't recognise. The knife was meant for me. Laura just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Who do you think killed her? Someone to do with her dad's work, I guess. Yeah, it's hard to think that Theo would have an enemy. You know, lovely guy - you like him, don't you? He was always really nice to me. Like him enough to let him hold on to a memory of Laura that's not true? I should probably be going. He thinks she'd never had a boyfriend. She didn't. He thinks she was still a virgin - at her age. Was she? I guess. I don't know. What a question! I know you think you're protecting Laura. But you might just be protecting her killer. She wasn't a virgin. You said she didn't have a boyfriend. She didn't. It was just Josh Fairlie, a friend. A friend with extras, you know? No, not really. Why are you interested in this stuff? It's got nothing to do with anything. You won't find him in there. He was on his gap year, in the middle of the Australian Outback. You didn't think to mention this to the police? What was the point? He obviously didn't do it. It would have devastated her dad if he'd known Laura was having sex. Where is he now? Still out there, as far as I know. All right, look, Emma... if you can think of anything, the tiniest scrap of something that might seem irrelevant... now's the time. I suppose there was that thing with Mr Jessop. Who? Stan. Our English teacher. We all fancied him but Laura was his favourite. We used to go to his house sometimes and talk about poetry. There was nothing in it. There was with some of the other girls but not with us. You're saying he has sex with some of the students? Only with the sixth formers. Why would you not mention this to the police? There's nothing to mention, it was just a crush. I feel bad even talking about it! I'm sure Laura wouldn't mind, a lot of people have crushes on teachers. Oh, no, no - I don't mean Laura had the crush... it was Mr Jessop on Laura. Morning. You're something new. What does that mean? Well, he gets a lot of visitors but none are male, and none are over 20... if you get my meaning. Countdown's on, Mum! You ever see this girl go in? Has he got something to do with it? Thanks a lot. How are they doing with the case? Getting close, Mr Jessop, getting close. Good. Laura was one of my favourite students. Mmm. So I understand. I was talking to one of her friends, she said, er, you had a crush on her. A crush? Is that why you're here, because I had a crush on Laura Wyre? Did you? I told the police everything that I know. When Laura was murdered, I was discussing Andrew Marvell with my fourth years. Mmm. Why don't you tell me everything there is to know about you and Laura and I won't tell them you've been fiddling with your kids? What? How bloody dare you?! You're saying you don't have sex with your students? Absolutely not. Well, it's a simple investigation. Do you want to try? Tell you what I'll do... you tell me exactly what happened with Laura Wyre, and I won't take it any further. You give me your word? Don't need a glass, do you? Thank you. Do you think they'll test us on this section...? Get off me! Come on, Laura! Emma says you've done it with a boy. Now do it with a real man. Please! Come on. No! Argh! Bloody slut! You gave me your word. Hey, Louise... I was just about to call you. Oh! Stan Jessop - Laura's English teacher - he didn't do it, but he does have sex with his students. Tell his head teacher, will you? Right. OK, thanks. Erm, oh, I heard back from Yorkshire. And? I'm sorry, Jackson. The guy confessed to every killing north of Luton, but it didn't check out. He's just a sick fantasist - he didn't kill your sister, I'm so sorry. Thanks for trying. Erm, I'm going to allow you to buy me dinner. I thought I was persona non grata. Well, you are, but I'm hungry. I'm going to make an exception. Dad - I forgot my toothbrush again. OK. What's his name? Josh Fairlie. F-A-I-R-L-I-E. Ooh! Argh! There's eight of them. How many in Australia? In Australia, one. Do you want to become his friend? Not really. I just want to ask him a question. Who was that lady? That was no lady, that was a police officer. Did she ask you out to dinner? Well, you know, even police officers have to eat occasionally, don't they? Come on, Josh Fairlie, remember something. What are we going to do tomorrow? Whatever you like. We could go to the zoo. We could go to the movies. We could go to a convent. ♪ My heart breaks as you take your long journey... ♪ Sylvia... My name is Sister Mary Luke. Sister Mary Luke. I'm sorry for the intrusion, but I need to ask you about Olivia. Who do you think took her? I don't know. I didn't know then, I don't know now. Well, if you tell me what you do remember, I can leave you to your... I've prayed for her all my life. I appreciate this is difficult for you, and I apologise for that. But Julia and Amelia have asked me to look into what happened to Olivia one last time. So if you would try and remember... It was a hot night, I remember that. SHE WHISPERS AN "OUR FATHER" Olivia? Olivia?! Where's your sister? Where's Olivia? I don't know. Julia? That's all I know. Please don't come here again. You were in your bedroom the entire night? I loved Olivia more than life itself, Mr Brodie. Do you think it's possible that someone loved her too much? What does that mean? Julia says... Julia - I suppose you like her, don't you? But then all men love Julia. Including your father? He touched her. He abused her. If that's true, then God will be his judge, not you, Mr Brodie. Did he touch you? No, he did not. Have we not suffered enough? Why are you digging all this up again? Blue mouse? Julia and Amelia found it in your father's possessions after he died. Why do you think he had it? I have no idea. Why do they lock themselves away from everyone else? Because they think they're helping us. That's stupid. Shh. Can we go home now? Yeah, my home? No, home - my house. I want my mum. Sure, no problem. PHONE RINGS Sorry, sister, sorry. Hello? Amelia, calm down, I can't understand... Speak slowly. Who...? Who's dead? What did Sylvia say about blue mouse? About blue mouse? Nothing, really. She doesn't like me very much, does she? Why would that be? I didn't kill my sister. How do you know she's dead? Are you saying she's not? No, I'm not saying anything. Then don't be so bloody cruel. Sorry. We're all a bit on edge. Baby! My baby! Come here, come here, you little bugger. Hey, Binky! Is this her? Oh! Oh, my beauty! My baby! Oh, you found her! Actually, my daughter did. Marlee, this is Binky. My cat is called... She's probably hungry, don't you think? CAT YOWLS You'd better give her a snack? Oh, yes. She's been out... Oh! Dad, is it OK if I get a cat? Yeah, I think you should have a cat. You tell your mum. Jump in. You're late. Well, we were out having a good time. Oh, were you? It was so cool! We went to a convent. Wow! A convent? What were you doing at a convent? Talking to a nun, of course. What else? It was a shame Sammy died, but I found her cat and the lady was so pleased that she kissed Dad. Well, wow, nice, OK, right. In you go, I'm going to say goodbye to Dad, OK? A bientot, Papa. A bientot, ma cherie. I've been offered a job. Where? New Zealand. You said no, obviously. Actually, I said yes. It's only for a year, so... A year? Marlee's staying with me, I hope? Don't be ridiculous! You can hardly take care of yourself, never mind her! BELL RINGS Who are you? My name's Josh Fairlie. You wanted to talk to me. Yeah. I got home yesterday. Or was it today? Anyway, I got your message. What brought you home? It was just time. You spoke to the police after Laura was killed, right? Mmm. By phone from Oz. Just a few questions. Why didn't you tell them you had a sexual relationship with her? Well, they didn't ask. Look, Laura was obsessed about her dad not finding out. She said it was just a fling, so why bother hurting him? Was it? Just a fling? It was to Laura. Look, it's probably nothing... Go on. We couldn't go to her place, obviously, and my old man, he's a minister in the kirk, so... We just went wherever we could. It happened a couple of times - the feeling of being watched. What did Laura say? She just laughed, said I was paranoid. Will you catch him? Will you help me? Yeah, well, I just did. Look, I had no right to get upset. As far as Laura was concerned, I was for... recreational use only. But... I found it stuffed in the bottom of her bag. You were jealous? I know. I know, it seems stupid, being jealous of someone whose idea of a present for Laura is a fluffy teddy. Who gave it to her? I don't know. Josh... No, I swear. I asked her that, and I got angry with her, but she wouldn't tell me. Said it wasn't worth it. I've got a daughter myself, Theo... I like to think I know everything about what's happening to her... I asked you to find Laura's murderer, and this is what you come up with, vile gossip and slander?! Theo, I'm only... Laura was a child, a young girl about to blossom. I will not have... I need you to think back. Who gave her the teddy bear? I don't know. For all I know, she... she could have bought it herself. I think there was someone in her life - a man. NO! Somebody nobody's found, because nobody was looking for him. He'd seen her with Josh, he was jealous... No, stop! Laura knew her killer, Theo! Theo! Theo! Come here. Theo, just relax. Just relax... What are you doing to him? Take my phone out of my pocket now and call an ambulance! Come on, Theo. Take the phone and call! Is he dying? Call an ambulance! Come on, Theo, stay with me! I'm being hit on by every other man in here - would you mind if I finished my drink at your table? That was fun, wasn't it? Fun? Yeah, I suppose it was. I want you to find someone for me. Do what? I tried phoning, making an appointment, but your assistant said, rather briskly, I thought, that you wouldn't see me unless I told her what it was all about. Are you saying that all that tonight...? Er, yeah, like I said, I want you to find someone for me. HE CHUCKLES Oh! No. At least hear my story. Hey, you know what? Absolutely not. My sister's name is Michelle. She was the brightest girl at school... I don't give a toss. You... Is that your car? What? No.
