 Explain how you knew Martin Canning. I was trying to help him. He's a client? Yeah, well, no, not really, kind of. Jackson. I gave him my number. He stopped someone smashing someone else's head in at a car crash. He was scared to testify. The road rage incident yesterday? That's who did it, the guy with the bat, I bet my life on it. How do you know so much about it? I was there. You were there? So that's what you do? Travel around finding crimes, generating your own business? No, I'm just cursed. Any news? You two turned over Favours yet?

 I don't take orders from you. Two girls dead, might be worth five minutes of your time. One dead, one possibly a figment of your imagination. You're not too old for me to give you a spanking. Stop needling him, he's new. What was he like? He was brave yesterday. He saved a man's life. Careful with him. He came to my house and attacked me. Who did? The bloke. Jackson! Jackson! Who's that? Someone it can't be. You're being weird again. Jackson, it's me. Stop there.

 Jackson. It's me, Martin. Come here. DI Munroe, Martin Canning. You're Martin Canning? So who's the... Lift this up. It's all right, it's all right. Who is it? It's Richard Moat. The comedian? Who? He was staying with me. How can you tell? He kept stealing my clothes, and he was wearing my favourite trousers. Yesterday my watch went missing. Go on, take him away. I'm sorry, but we've informed your brother that you're dead. Christopher? Did he sound upset? Well, yes, I suppose so, yes. I'm going to need you to make a statement, Mr Canning. That was meant for me. That should have been me. I told you. It was tucked under a copy of Big Jugs. You won't remember, but I bought this for you a couple of birthdays ago. "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings. "Look on my works ye mighty and despair." You looked at the cover, made a face and stuck another pint of pina colada down your fat throat. Why did I end up with you, Graham? How did that happen? I wanted a man who read poetry, and loved me as an equal. Not a man who read Big Jugs and measured his life in building housing estates. The king who thought he'd rule forever. Do you have any reliable witness to this attack on you? Yeah, my friend, Julia Land. I think he said reliable, she's an actress. So this guy is killing people because they witnessed him trying to assault Bradley? You got a better idea? It doesn't make sense. I didn't say it did. He was waiting at your house? Yeah. How did he know where you lived? I don't know. Why pick on you? Martin stopped him with his computer, but you? What did you do? Jackson Brodie, you've been making trouble. He knew my name. How did he know my name? You tell me. My name's Jackson, Jackson Brodie. I'm an investigator. Oh, that's mad, no, that really doesn't make any sense. What? I gave my card to the girl you found dead yesterday. There was no business card on her. Jackson? We've found another body. What if this psycho's connected? What if he's responsible for the death of the two Russian girls? That's ridiculous, Jackson. One we don't have a body for, and one died of an overdose. I'm just saying what if? I'm not persuading my boss to pursue a line of enquiry based on your supposition, I can't. What do we know about this guy? Presumably his plates didn't check out? Were fake, or what? From yesterday? We didn't get them. Our two major witnesses went AWOL before we got statements and nobody else came forward. You need to forget about everything and get some sleep, OK? Jackson? Yeah, I... er... I should, I will, I'm knackered, you're right. Good. Good. Jackson, come with me. No, no! MOBILE PHONE RINGS Hello? It's me... You still got that card I gave you yesterday? Don't take it out. Yes. Don't give the registration number to the police. Why not? They'll be running around, I'll find him and take care of him quickly. Trust me. OK. Right, call me when you're done. All right. The Four Clans where you say you spent the night with Paul Bradley. Could you stop saying it like that. It's just there's no sign of your name in the register. The night porter said it wasn't necessary as I wasn't staying the night. The night porter doesn't recall seeing you or anyone like you. It must have been horrible seeing your friend's head all bashed in? He wasn't my friend. Your lover? No! Perhaps you rowed with Richard because you went to a hotel with another man? No! Why aren't you listening to me? Paul Bradley stole from me, he drugged me, why aren't you asking him? He's not here and you are. You don't know where he is. He gave the hospital a false address. He's out there, looking for me! Look, I'm the victim here! My laptop's broken, my memory stick's gone along with my new Nina Riley novel. My wallet's been stolen. And now there's a washed-up comedian splattered all over my house. For an innocent man you seem very guilty. What's your deep, dark secret, Martin? Where's Jackson? How was it? They've taken a statement. You didn't give them the registration? No. You've still got that card from yesterday? Can I stay with you? Deborah, it's me... Me your boss! I'll text you a number, tell me who the car's registered to. Bradley drugged me, suppose he comes after me? If he wanted to kill you, he'd have done it in the hotel. Stay with friends. I've told the police I'm staying with you. That's not going to work, I'm afraid. There's people trying to kill me. I want you to protect me. I need you to protect me. Let me make a call to the police. No, no. Not the police. I want you to be my bodyguard. I'll speak to DI Munroe, she's a friend of mine... No! No! Please. Jackson, please. Be my bodyguard. What have you got? Er... Martin, Deborah. Deborah, Martin. Right. Julia Land phoned. Don't forget, it's her first night tonight. Fine. And your wife phoned. Ex-wife. She says, "You are a bastard. "A complete, hateful, little shit. "Bring the permission form around today." Did you find out who owns the car? I'm glad you asked me that. This case is turning out to be like one of those Russian dolls, a riddle, wrapped in an enigma, shrouded in a mystery. I finally found out that Favours is registered in the Cayman Islands, which is a bit strange for a Scottish cleaning company, Who's the car registered to? Favours shares its registration address with a property development company. Deborah. Hatter Homes. The car is registered to Hatter Homes. Graham Hatter is the MD, and there is his home address. Martin, wait here. But I want to come with you. SHE MOUTHS Really? Where do you think you're going? Stay here and keep warm. RADIO: 'And later in the programme...' Hello? '..their definitive guide to keeping bug and disease-free this winter...' SHE GASPS It's all right, there's nothing to be scared of. I think I'd like you to leave, if you wouldn't mind. I'm a private investigator. My name is Jackson Brodie. I'm looking for Graham Hatter. He might want to know there's a mad man driving a car registered to his company. This guy, actually. His name is Terrence Smith. He's worked for Graham for years. Graham's your husband? Gosh, you're good. Thank you. So, any idea where I might find this Smith? No, I'm afraid not. Graham should be able to tell me. I'm afraid you can't ask him. Why's that? PHONE RINGS No, Murdo. He's still in Thurso. No, I can't imagine why anyone would want to spend so long there either. I told you before, Murdo. I don't know when he'll be back. It's quite a bonfire you've got going. I'm no expert but they looked like very expensive dresses. Are you having a clear-out? Got to make room for the new. Now, if you don't leave... A new start is it? Or a new you? You're leaving me no option. If you're not gone in... Your husband will be thrilled when he gets back from Thurso. Won't he just. Except he's never coming back from Thurso, is he? He never went there. Graham's had a severe heart attack and he's not expected to pull through. I'm sorry. Why would you tell this Murdo bloke that he's in Thurso? I've been telling everyone he's in Thurso. Don't know why I chose there, just the first name that came into my head. I know I'm supposed to tell people, but... I just can't be bothered somehow. They'll make such a drama of it. I think it's a thing that goes off better if you're quiet about it. PHONE BEEPS Excuse me! Text. Well? Erm... Maggie. His secretary. Tell me. I do know she performs other functions. "Have you done it yet? Have you got rid of the old bag?" Well, she's not much of a looker herself. What are you doing? Sending a reply, "Sorry, I'm in Thurso. Speak to you as soon as I can." Put, "Sorry, darling." With a kiss? Not his style. PHONE RINGS Christopher! No, that's right, I'm still alive. Yeah. Oh, well, sorry. It is a long way to go for no reason, but... Look, while you're here, why don't we meet up? Right. OK. No, no. Well, have a safe journey home. Yeah. OK. Bye. Does the name Favours mean anything to you? It's one of your husband's companies. He doesn't keep me appraised of all his activities. Two girls who worked for Favours are dead. I think Terence Smith killed them. What girls? Russian girls. Prostitutes? Why would you ask that? It's a cleaning company. I don't know. I found this, at the back of the wardrobe. It doesn't mean anything to me. I don't know if it's of any use. It's gobbledegook. But it has an address. So thank you. You wouldn't mind opening the gate, would you? Hello? Er, don't you need a warrant for that? Absolutely, good idea if you're a copper. Luckily, I'm not any more. Don't hang about. They shut it down. Something's spooked them. Overnight by the looks of it. What was this place? It was meant to be a booking agency for a cleaning company, but who knows. What's that got to do with the guy who's out there trying to kill me? I'm not sure, Martin. Some connection. Now the answer is somewhere in here if I can make head or tail of it. Can I have a look? It's in code. Yeah. I know all about code. In Death Wore Tweed, when Nina Riley confronts the U-boat commander, Baron Swartzbard, he has a little... Real code. Real bad guys. Computers, algorithms, that stuff. May I? Drive yourself mad. Thank you. Well, it's an Atbash cipher. Sorry? These column headings, it's a simple Atbash cipher. A simple opposite-end substitution code, A equals Z, and B equals Y. I don't care, can you read it? The first column is girls' names. Second column is passport numbers. But they're not British. Then we've got cleaning hours. Money in. Um, other hours, money in. A lot more money. Why would you be a cleaner if you were earning that much money? The reason it's the oldest profession in the world. What? Prostitution. Someone's making them do it, and they don't keep the money. Here's the thing, why would you do it? What? If it's going that well, why would you kill a successful Russian prostitute? Martin? Sorry. Yes, I... Hey, here, come, sit down. What's going on? Martin, talk to me, what's going on? Three years ago, I was in Russia. That's not a crime. I was spending my first big royalty cheque on a holiday in Moscow and St Petersburg. And, erm, I met this girl called Irianna. She was working in a little concession in the hotel lobby selling Matryoshka dolls, you know, the Russian dolls within dolls. Martin, why are you telling me this? One evening, I was in the hotel bar on my own, and she came over and started talking to me. God. Jackson, she was so beautiful. And we drank a lot of vodka. A lot of vodka. And we laughed a lot, even though we didn't understand what the other one was saying. And then she was in my hotel room. SHE SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ♪ I feel so wonderful ♪ Uh-uh-oh, don't let go ♪ Uh-uh-oh, don't let go ♪ Two hearts are beating together ♪ I'm in love, I'm in love ♪ I'm in love, I'm in love ♪ Is this for ever and ever? ♪ I'm in love, I'm in love... ♪ I was just captivated by her. Nothing like that had ever happened to me. HE GRUNTS Do we need this level of detail, Martin? Yes, we do. She wasn't a prostitute. But it's a very hard country and she could see that I had money. MOBILE RINGS Sorry. I was stupid, wasn't I, to think that someone like that could be interested in me? I don't think so, no. 'You have two new messages.' 'Graham, it's Murdo here again. I've had enough. 'The Talling development basically went tits skyward. 'This could be a bigger debacle than the city tram scheme! 'I hope you're dead in a ditch somewhere, you bastard!' ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS 'Graham? It's me, Maggie. Things are getting difficult. 'Murdo had a go at me. He said I must know where you are, 'but I don't! Why have you left me?' ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS Tell me if there's enough sugar in it, Terence. Aye. Very nice, Mrs Hatter. You going for a run? It's a leisure suit, it's to relax in. You're usually one for the dresses. Just drink your tea. He's away on business. I've told you that, Terence. There's no point endlessly asking the same question. If Mr Hatter needs you, he will call you. Is it to do with money? What? I mean, pardon? Does he owe you money? There's things that need to be sorted out. Where is he? He's not far away. Time to go, Terence. I've done a lot of work, Mrs Hatter, and the problem's not fixed yet. I need to talk to him. Don't you dare raise your voice to me in my own home, Terence Smith. Mr Hatter should not treat me like this. I do not deserve it. You tell him to meet me at the club tonight! At eleven! I need to see him. What I don't understand is, if you have a talent to write, no matter how small, why would you waste that talent writing tatty potboilers? Well, the Nina Riley mysteries are actually quite popular. Quite popular... tatty potboilers. Jackson! Jackson! Er... one second. Is she here? Who? Sorry, Jackson, I couldn't stop her. Piss off! Marlee, I went to get her from school, but she wasn't there. Did you call the police? No, I went home hoping she was waiting, I phoned you, but you never answer. Call now, say she's been missing for hours, they'll take it seriously. This is your fault, playing the victim yesterday! Did you call her friends? Some of them. You got a class list? Uh-huh. Call the rest, go home and wait for her. OK. Try the park and that pizza place that she sometimes likes. Oh, Jackson, if anything happens to her... Josie, I'll find her. 'Niamh!' No! Jackson, no! Come on, think, think. We better get you home. Your mum's going nuts. I've made a decision. I'm not going to New Zealand. Why not? Because I want to stay here with you. Thanks. Listen... It's not that I won't miss you. I don't want you to be sad. Sad? I'm not sad. All right, I am a bit sad. Sometimes everybody is. I make you laugh, don't I? Yeah, you do. So that's why I'm going to stay here with you. Listen, we'll make a deal. You go to New Zealand with your mum. No, Dad. You haven't heard the end of the deal yet. You go away to New Zealand and I'll stop being sad. You know why? Because I know that you'll be having an amazing adventure, you'll be somewhere incredible, enjoying yourself, and that will make me excited and happy. Honest? Honest. And you won't be sad? I won't be sad. Promise? Promise. Can you take me home now, Dad? HE LAUGHS Yeah, come on. Oh, thank God! Oh, baby, I was so frightened. Don't you ever do that to me again, OK? Sorry. I was so scared, baby. Are you OK? Where did you go? It's really not difficult to tell the difference between good literature and bad literature. A child can do it. When I was seven I read, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. And, no offence, but why would I read Alex Blake when I could read Mark Twain? Is she OK? She's fine. He's very good at finding people. That's what I just told your new client. Terence Smith came to see me this afternoon. He frightened me. Did he threaten you? He worships my husband, Mr Brodie, and without him... He did this, didn't he? I think he did, yes. There's a place Graham used to go to with Terence, some dive. Terence would drive him home and pour him out onto the sofa. He'll be there tonight, 11 o'clock. Why did you not go to the police with this? If it's a question of money? It's not. You're not telling me everything you know, Gloria. Of course not. Birth! Death! Give birth to yourself! Keep looking and you will find the baby's womb. Birth! Birth! Birth! Death! Death! Death! Womb! Womb! Womb! The act of love is the little death. In the French... Le petit mort... le petit mort. Where does lust end and hate begin? It is impossible to say. And yet I keep asking the question. Looking for an enigma of an answer. Hey, terrific. It was shit. The play is shit. It was great, you were great. God, I couldn't concentrate at all, I just... I can't help thinking about poor Richard. Well, it didn't show. Look, I never lie to you, do I? The play's, kind of challenging, you know, as a fella, but you're really talented, honestly. Jackson, I... I did something bad yesterday. Oh. Right. Tell me it wasn't him? It doesn't matter who it was, I was just feeling... You didn't call, and... So it's my fault, is that what you're saying? Well, what are we really? I mean, it's been six weeks. Seven, actually. Who's counting? You should run a mile. I'm damaged goods. We all are, aren't we? She suddenly realised, "Bertie, this was no accident, this was murder!" Where did you get this? I found it. You were there, at the road-rage incident? That was well good. Jesus, Archie, you're a witness! Here, don't touch my stuff. What did you see? Just somebody hitting a guy with a baseball bat. That's horrible. Do you want to talk about it? It was quite funny. What's happening to you? I'm going to Hamish's. I don't think that's a good idea! Terence Smith! Terence! Terence Smith, how are you, man? It's Terence Smith! Haven't seen you for ages, what's up? Wait! Wait! Oh, hey, listen. Shut up, OK? All right, all right, all right. Who are you? I'm a friend. You are a friend of Terence. I'm not. I was following him. Why? Because, he killed a girl who looked exactly like you. Who was she? None of your business. He would have killed you, too. I can take care of myself. I'm trying to help you. I don't need your help. Taxi! Morning. He's still out there. I know. Oh, my God. It's all right. Martin, it's... DOORBELL RINGS What were you like as a 14-year-old boy, Jackson? Come in. Archie saw what you saw at that road rage incident and didn't bat an eyelid. When I was his age I nearly ended up in court, I remember that. What for? Stealing. Wow, I'm shocked! So what happened? I went in a different direction, didn't I? Joined the army. I can't see Archie in the army. God, I hope not. I never thought I'd see the day when you came to me for parenting advice. Nor did I. I love him, I do. But some days I think I might love my cat more. He's just less trouble. So we've got the DNA back from Martin Canning's flat. And? Terrence Smith. Criminal record as long as your arm. Did you find him? No, he scarpered. We've got a few possible addresses. He works for a Graham Hatter, who has a connection to Favours. But Favours has shut down. This is the bit where you're incredibly impressed. You knew, didn't you, you wee shite? Not all of it. What do you know about Hatter Homes? The fraud squad are on to it. Apparently, Graham Hatter paid a bribe to get permission to build some hideous housing estate. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. They're looking into money laundering, extortion and prostitution. Mr and Mrs Hatter are going down for a very long time. Mrs Hatter? She's co-director. It looks like she might carry the can because Mr Hatter's done a bunk. I know where he is. For Christ's sake, Jackson. Do you get some sadistic pleasure in withholding information? Please tell me where he is, a few people would like to have a word with him. Well, don't expect him to talk back. Wait here. The police will be on their way to hospital now. He could do with some company. Gloria, they'll take it all. Everything Graham touched. This place, Hatter Homes, the lot. I probably deserve it. I knew what he was. You didn't do the things he did. I knew what he was capable of. And I expect you were terrified of him. Ask yourself, why didn't you leave him? He's not the kind of man to let people walk away. DOOR BUZZES You'll be all right, I'll help you. Hello? I thought you were dead! Come on, Jackson. Where are you? What are you doing here? What you doing here? How do you know her? How do you know her? Well, she's my husband's dominatrix. Do try and keep up, Jackson. Get rid of him, Gloria. We don't need... Hey! I can't do that. Mr Brodie works for me. That's right. And we want to know who the girl was and what happened to her. No. Just tell him. He's like a dog with a bone. I don't know and I don't say. You do know and you will say and you'll say now. Cos you want to tell me, cos you know she died horribly, cos you know Smith is a cruel man and he'd have enjoyed it. She ended up in the sea, a thousand miles from home. Unwanted, unloved... Not unloved! Her name is... was Sophia Mikhailichenko. She was 25 years old. She was born in Ekaterinburg. Her mother still lives there. She was your sister? My baby sister. Only by five minutes but... Why did he kill her? Because she spoke out. Against the boss, Graham Hatter? I tried to stop her, I begged her. So why are you here? With Graham in a coma, I have no protection. But I do have this... What is it? It's Graham's memory stick. Where did you get it? I stole it from him, stupid, when he was having his heart attack. And now it is ours, Gloria. Yours and mine. I have come here to make deal with you. It has all the bank details of all his companies. In Scotland, Jersey, Cayman Islands and Switzerland. You are company director? The company will have its assets frozen, probably in a couple of hours. That's not a problem. I work in bank in Russia. I understand these things. We need details, password. I then transfer all money into one of Swiss accounts. They cannot touch in Switzerland. Why would we do that? I think what she's suggesting, Gloria, is that you do a runner. Take all the cash. It's your choice. You can stay here and fight it with the best lawyers you can afford... Or? Or live to fight another day. You can run away with me, Gloria. I'll pack a bag. Just grab your passport, you don't have time, the police could turn up... Lets not forget, Smith's about somewhere. But you have guard. What? Guard. Man in car with gun. With...? Jesus! Martin? Martin, talk to me. I don't deserve to live. Of course you do. Don't be ridiculous. Give me that... No, no, no. I knew it would come back to haunt me. I knew it. The psycho, the girls getting killed, Paul Bradley, Richard Moat... It's all my fault. None of it's your fault. Yes, yes, it is. You don't know what I did, you don't know. I did something terrible. SIREN WAILS You like that. Was fun? Yes. You like that enough to maybe give me gift? A gift? What kind of a gift? A little money gift? OK. Um... Yeah, if that's what you want. I'll have to go to the hotel reception and get some cash. Money now. No, I have to withdraw some. No! No cards, cash! No, I understand but I have to go... Money or I scream. Yeah, I'm going to go to the hotel lobby and get... SHE SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN Get off! Oh, God! Irianna? SHE MOANS Stupid, stupid, stupid girl. Stupid... I don't know why she did it. What happened then? My bedroom was on the sixth floor and they were building some kind of patio thing on the ground floor and there was a skip below my window. And the next morning I heard them driving it off and I went to the airport. I thought they were going to arrest me. I wanted them to. And then I found myself at home. It was an accident, Martin. I don't know what to do. Just try and do the right thing. You're not a mad man, you're a brave man. Look, you saved a man's life the other day. I wasn't thinking, I didn't know what I was doing. You did it, though, didn't you? Give me the gun. Come on, just hand it over. Come on. Where did you get this? It's Paul Bradley's. The shower head was the right kind of bulk and weight and so I put it in the bag. After he drugged me, he must have just gone away without checking. What made you take it? I thought that he was going to use it on me. What's Paul Bradley doing with a... an assassin's gun? Munroe said he's missing, he gave the hospital a false address. I told you that I thought there was something wrong with him. He was a hit man, Martin. He was away to do a job. What? Get rid of someone. Get rid of someone... She said he'd never let anyone walk away. Who did? Pop the boot. Stay here. If anybody comes beep the horn. S-I-N-A-T-R-A. No! Sport - what he like? Ali, Mohammed Ali, worshipped him. No, wait. Insisted on calling him Clay - Cassius Clay. No. Shit! What are you two doing here? You've got to get going. We need password. We've tried everything - his favourite cars, food, music. Gloria, you're not safe here. We're not going without money. Help us. Me? It could be anything, I don't know the bloke. Please. Shit, shit! No, no, think of the opposite of anything you'd expect. Not who he was but who he wasn't. The last think you'd expect him to do, the last place you'd expect him to go, the last thing he'd ever read... Oh! Go on. What? "King of kings, look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!" Shelley? Ozymandias. Try it. Type it in. It worked! Oh, Graham! He reads poetry. He was probably just looking for the most obscure word he could find. Money will be moved. Great. Let's get the two of you to an airport, quick. He's gone! I kill them girls for him, he does a runner and he's left me in the shite! And you... You are going to run off and join him, aren't you? He's in intensive care. She's got nothing to do with it. You think I'm stupid, but I am not. I want my share of the money. There's nothing here, Terence. But I have to get away as well! Listen to her. Walk away, there's nothing here for you. Leave it! Back off! The police are onto you, the game's up. They've got your... No! You get to die last, smart arse! It's OK. Are you all right? Yeah. Did you mean to do that? Yeah. This time I did. Good job. Um... Right, ladies, Martin, it's probably a good time to leave. No, no. I'm staying. The police are on their way. No. I am sick of running. Well, what are you going to do? Tell them the truth? No. I'm a writer. No, the only other person to visit him apart from his wife was his prostitute. The doctor didn't get her real name. Apparently, she's a Russian dominatrix. What, just now? OK, I'm on my way. There's been a reported shooting. Good bye, Mr Hatter. A little present from your wife. Hey! Dad! Did you think I was going to let you go without one last squeeze? All right, now look, I'll always be with you, you're never alone. If that's all right? Scoop me every day. Skype. Skype me every day. Every day. All right? Come here. KNOCKING All right, let me remember that face. I think I've got it. See you later, alligator. In a while, crocodile. Hey. Good luck. Thank you. SOBBING I tried to think what you would do. He began shaking and making this noise. His legs were jelly. It was horrible. I didn't know what to do. Mum? It's OK. It's OK. ♪ We'll find a jukebox and see what a quarter will do ♪ I don't want to talk ♪ I just want to go back to... ♪ DOORBELL RINGS Hi. You got Marlee staying over? No. You got back together with your ex? No. Actresses? No actresses. In that case, I'll come in. How's Martin holding up? He's a strange one. I gave him his USB stick back with his new novel on it and he threw it in the bin, said something about Mark Twain. Sensitive artist, although he did all right this afternoon... from what I heard. What, killing Smith with his own gun? Surprisingly so. Gloria Hatter's vanished. Looks like she's left the country. Will she be indicted? I'd have thought so, seeing as her husband's dead. Just hope she's got the money for a good lawyer. Dead? Gone to that big mock-Tudor housing estate in the sky. Case closed. There's a girl out there somewhere floating around. Yeah, we found her. She came ashore. We still don't know anything about her. No-one's missed her. Her name's Sophia and I know people who miss her. She came here from Russia six months ago. She thought the streets might be paved with gold. They weren't. These are the details of Lena's. I kind of promised I'd send them home. OK. Thank you. A neighbour of the Hatters' thought she saw a black car parked on their driveway this afternoon. Oh, yeah, lot of black cars around. Yeah. Black Alfa Romeo. Around the time of the break-in and the shooting of Terence Smith. She couldn't be sure though, and I decided not to make a note of it. She was very old. Ah, well. Do you fancy getting drunk? They're on the plane, on their way to New Zealand and I keep seeing their faces. OK. Sorry. Get some sleep, Jackson.
