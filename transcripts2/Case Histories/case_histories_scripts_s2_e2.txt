 Case Histories (2011–…): Season 2, Episode 2 - Nobody's Darling - full transcript 
 After Jackson's daughter Marlee returns to live with him, he is approached by Rachel Stewart, who is perturbed by her boyfriend Andy Marshall's frequent disappearances. Jackson follows Andy to a remote farm where he meets Miriam Baker. Miriam believes that the death of her estranged daughter, Isobel Marshall, a noted equestrian, was no accident and blames her then son-in-law -- Andy Marshall. Posing as a friend of Isobel, Jackson calls on Andy and is told by Rachel that he was having an affair with her whilst still married; and a colleague of Isobel reveals that Isobel was planning to take their son Freddie and leave Andy. Jackson discovers that Isobel was less than the golden girl suggested by her public image before working out how she died. His luck seems to be in when he wins a small fortune on a race-horse called Nobody's Darling but sadly the death of the bookmaker leads to the exposure of a scam and the winnings are frozen.

 Case Histories Season 2 - Episode 02 Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd Sync: Marocas62 "Nobody's Darling" Welcome home, love. It's... it's looking good, Dad. I've made some space upstairs. What? I can't have your room, it's not fair. You're getting a bit too big for us to share. Well, maybe we should think about somewhere else to stay.

 A two bedroom maybe? Maybe we should take it one step at a time. If I'm going to live here, we'll need more space. Did you have another child while I was away, Dad? You don't like it. No, I like it, it's, um... it's pink. Yep. Thanks, Dad. It's lovely. We can take it all back if you want, get Goth black. It's all right. It'll be good for me to have a change from everything all white and perfect the way Mum likes it. Now, I got you this so you can always tell me where you are

 and if you need picking up or whatever. I just need to get a SIM with an international package. I've looked up some good deals. We'll get that sorted. And I also need to get a bus pass so I can go out, see my friends after school and stuff. I can pick you up, drive you round. It's all right, Dad, I'll get the bus. All my friends do. We'll talk about it tomorrow. You hungry? I've got... cinnamon toast, I've got crumpets. I can't eat all that. I'm all bloated, Dad. I've got my period. OK. - I get my periods now, you know. - No... yeah, I did know. Right. OK, so first off I just need some basic information. Hobbies, interests, that kind of thing. And Second Life is what? Avatar? Right. Yeah. Are you sure he's actually into real women? Anyway, you... yes, think about it and get back to me. Thank you. Bye. You're in before ten! Eight hours sleep. I cooked my daughter a wholesome breakfast, dropped her off at the school gate, thank you very much. So, what, now you're, like, Father of the Year? What was all that about? On the phone. My new honey-trapping sideline. Wives call me, I then accidentally on purpose bump into their husband in a bar, I talk to them about what they like, flirt with them a bit, then suggest I'm into no-strings sex and when they bite, I'm out of there and file my report to their spouse. What if they don't bite? Come on! Right. Not out of my office, not in my name. Well, you can't pay my wages, Jackson, because you're not collecting fees for work you've already done. This one for Mackie has been outstanding since you disappeared. I've left him ten messages with zero returns. He's a bookie, he doesn't like to pay out. Collect the money, Jackson. Investigations. No. No, we don't do entrapment. I don't care what it says in the advert. It's wrong. Did I startle you? It was open. No, no, we're open. I am open. - Jackson Brodie. - Rachel Stewart. For now Stewart, I will be Marshall. Come in. Sit down. How can I help you, Rachel? - I'm worried about my fiance. - OK. Our big day is three weeks from Sunday. We're moving to Lancaster, a new house and everything. And I'm committing myself for life to this man and all of a sudden, I don't know if he loves me any more. And I am loveable. I'm practically Maria von Trapp, for God's sake. Except without the guitar. You know, the woman who married a widower, made a sad house into a happy home. "The Sound Of Music". I was Freddie's... his son's nanny after his wife died. And now Andy and I are getting married. At least we're supposed to be getting married. Rachel? This sounds very difficult for you, but... I'm not a marriage counsellor. But something's changed. Andy's never been very... he doesn't like sharing his feelings. But lately, he's been so distant. Sometimes he doesn't even look at me. And I just want to get it back to how it was. Do you think he's having an affair or something? Are there any unexplained absences or lies? Last Wednesday, he was missing for six hours. He says he was at work, but I rang his office and there was no answer. Friday, all afternoon, his mobile was off. The following Tuesday, it was the same story. He missed dinner and I called his office, but there was no answer. I'd follow him myself, but I'm looking after Freddie and it's not exactly convenient stalking someone. I shouldn't have to, that's your job. Thanks. How long has this been going on? A few months... Ever since we decided to get married, really. It's ironic, I guess. Ever since we got engaged, I've never felt so alone. OK. Jackson Brodie. I thought you were Down Under. - I was. I'm back. - So I see. I've come for my money, Mackie. Well, you're just in time. Because there's more work to do. - You'd better come in. - What you talking about? My case, you numpty. The thieving of Ian Mackie. You sure didnae solve it. Hold on, we caught that bloke, that Joe Burns, red-handed. Aye, but money's still gone missing from the shop. - You sure? - Joe Burns reckons I'm not wise in the head. Don't you join him. Why would you assume it's him? You've got ten people working for you between the track and the shop. Only one who vowed to pan ma windies. Mention my name to him. I'm sure he'll tell you all about it. Now, you go and have a sniff around. Where are you going? - Out. - Can I remind you, you're scheduled to work the shop at four. I made the bloody schedule, Ian. I'll be there. She sure took a fancy to you. That's the first time I've seen her teeth since about 1992. Mackie, I want paying for the work I've done. You carry on with the case and I'll see you at the track tomorrow. Come on. What you doing? Come on, do something. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. There you go. You're gorgeous, aren't you? Hello, mate. What's your name? Hey, it's all right. You're trespassing. Hey-hey, it's all right. I'm sorry, I'm from Edinburgh, I just got lost. You don't sound like you're from Edinburgh. Yeah, well, I need to know where I am, that's all. Give me your wallet. Just...just keep calm, that's all. There's nothing funny going on. Jackson Brodie - private investigator? That's why I was embarrassed to say I was lost. So, what ARE you doing here? I just want to find my way home, honestly. You didn't... come about Isobel? No. Who's Isobel? My daughter. She died. I'm sorry. The procurator fiscal ruled it was death by misadventure. She was beautiful, talented. A force of nature. You thought I was here to investigate her death. Why? I was driving home, was on the track near here, and there he was. Ollie, Isobel's horse. I just knew something was wrong. I rushed back here and there was Andy. Her husband. He'd found her and called the ambulance. I still thought she just might be OK. It's not like she hadn't been thrown before. Isobel? It says she wasn't wearing a hat. That's what made me suspicious. Ollie's a wild one. A really powerful horse. She wouldn't even walk him around the ring without wearing a hat. So, you think it wasn't an accident? I don't believe it. What about... Andy? What does he think? He'd just arrived, so he says. I sometimes looked after Freddie, my grandson. He'd called round to ask me to babysit. But he didn't have Freddie with him. So, why didn't he phone? Look, this article's from five years ago. Did the police investigate... - your concerns at the time? - No. No...what? No, they didn't investigate or no... you didn't mention anything? You didn't, did you? Why not? I just couldn't. - What does that mean? - You're a detective. You could talk to Andy. But there isn't much time. He's leaving Scotland in three weeks. He just came round to tell me it's all been finalised. He's taking my grandson to Lancaster. I'm not sure there's anything I can do. I just know my daughter was murdered. Let me see if I can find anything out. CHAMPION KILLED IN RIDING ACCIDENT What are his tastes? What should I wear? Should I wear heels, or...? Right. Well, what would you wear? Really? Have you thought about an image change? God, no, no! God, no, I'm not suggesting you dress like a prostitute. I'm... No. No, excuse me, just because a woman wears a tight dress and a pair of heels doesn't make her... Hello? Hello? Winning manner with the clients there, Deborah. Surprised there aren't queues around the block! It'll pick up. Who's this? Isobel Baker-Marshall, the ex-wife, dead wife, of the bloke who's the fiance of the woman who was sitting here who wants to see if he's having an affair, but... but her mother wants to see if he killed her, murdered her. And you're working for both of them. - That I am. - That'll be fun! Hello. Jackson Brodie's office. Can I help? Hello, can I speak to Jackson, please? Yes, you're in luck. He's right here. - Phone call for you, Mr Brodie. - Thank you. - Rachel. - Any news? Nothing yet, I'm afraid. Bit too soon. OK. I'm sure you know what you're doing. - Yeah. - Maybe follow him tomorrow. Not today because... after school, I've got my class, he'll be with Freddie. Talk to you soon. Joe Burns? - Do I know you? - Jackson Brodie. Caught you stealing from your boss. You're the one who grassed on me? - Mackie hired me. - Stinking ball bag! I told him I'd pan his windies in. He hired you? What, like a henchman? Like a detective. So it wasnae Marie? Look, we didn't hand you over to the police first time. He's not going to go so easy on you this time. What are you talking about? I haven't even been near the shop. The track? I cannae go there. - Why not? - Pain. I'm detoxing from that scene. Money's still going missing, Joe, so whoever you're working with, whatever you've got going on, now's the time to talk up when it's just between us. It's got nothing to do with me. Why did you think Mrs. Mackie was on to you? Dunno. - Well, why would you say it? - I dunno. Maybe she saw I was dressing a bit flash. She was suspicious, you know. But this is just how I dress. I like to look smart. Yeah. You've pulled it off, big time. - Hello, Jackson. - How you doing? Er...I'm great. And late. What can I do for you? You still got a gift list? I just got your thank you card and I haven't actually sent a present yet. I wouldn't worry about it. You didn't turn up to the wedding. Yeah, I'm sorry about that, too. Marlee's come to live with me, so I couldn't get away. She's living with you? By yourself? - Yeah. - Well, that's never going to work. Thanks for that. How's married life? It's excellent. Very sociable. In fact, I'm having a wee drinks thing this afternoon at Patrick's... my... our house. A drinks thing? What, like a cocktail party? No, it's a gathering of friends. Patrick's colleagues. People that couldn't make it to the wedding. - Like me. - No, not like you. Civilised people. Because I'm not civilised enough to mix with Patrick's friends. Well, do you want to come? I might pop in. What time? Well...it's 4pm, which is why I have to go. All right. Okey-doke. Shit! Oh, hi, Louise, hi. Hi, there. Hi, there. Hi! I'm back, I'm back. Sorry, I got stuck at work. I've got everything. It's all right. Patrick and I have got it all under control. If I had a kitchen like this, it would make me make something other than toast. Jackson Brodie was our first guest and he's been kindly helping me with the food ever since. Well, so you've got everything. No, no, no, you can never have too many mini quiches. I'll go and offer this lot round, make room on the plate for more. Yeah. - He invited himself. - It's fine. I was just surprised to see him at the door, that's all. Whose is all this? Silver forks? I've never seen these before in my life. Well, they're mine... ours. The spoils of your former marriage. My stuff like a refugee's compared to your stuff, you know. A refugee who spends a lot of time in Ikea. Well, if it makes you happy, I'll replace every last teaspoon in the house with their latest range. How's that? Hey. Want a hand? Why is everything so bloody mini? So you don't have a mouthful of food when it's time for witty banter. Can you pass me those skewers, please? - What, the mini skewers? - Toothpicks. Thank you. It's all right! Don't panic. You're all right. Patrick's friends are all right. Why wouldn't they be? Thanks. So, what are we going to hit them with now? Mini pizzas, mini sausages? Pizza? Sausage? There's a lot of pressure to this married life, eh, Mrs. C? Don't do that. You're not Mrs Carter? Miss Munroe? Or Mrs. Munroe-Carter. How about that? Very posh. Piss off. Pissing off with the... - mini pizzas. - Hey. He says, "How do I know it's you?" So Louise tells the filthiest joke you've ever heard in your life and he goes, "Oh, yeah, I remember you." Now, which one of her three filthy jokes did she tell? Patrick? Have you got a minute? Excuse me. What the hell do you think you're doing? Trying to see if you're all right. No, what are you doing here in my house, in my life, with my husband?! I'm trying to be civilised. - Make things normal. - Normal?! You're NOT normal! This is NOT normal! "Can I help you in the kitchen, Mrs Carter? "Oh jolly japes with PC Louise on the street." Is this some sort of joke to you? How dare you?! Of course it's not a joke. I'm trying to... move on. I don't know what you want from me. Piss off, Jackson. Just go. God, I'm going to be sick. Just go! Please go home! OK, just go like this. Perfect. That's perfect on you. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. How's it going over there? What you doing? Deborah's just helping me with my homework. She's all right, Deborah, isn't she? - Yeah. - All right, good. Listen, there's one more place I've got to go, then I'll be back. OK, then. I see you later. - Bye. - See ya. Another healthy snack? OK. It's so nice to hear from a friend of Isobel's. - You used to ride together? - Well, when I was a kid. We moved to away, but I never forgot her and I thought I'd look her up now we've moved back. I couldn't believe it. Please do come in. If you could remove your shoes, please. The highest percentage of lead content in a home - is dragged in with dirt. - Is that right? Yeah, believe it or not. It's just to the left there. Straight through. OK, Freddie, physics homework. Come on. I don't mean to be rude, Dad, but when are we eating? When you've done your homework. This is Jackson, by the way. He knew your mum when she was a little girl. - This is Freddie. - Hi, Jackson. - How do you do? - Good. Come on, it's this way. - He's a good boy. - Yes. He's obsessed with the Multiverse. Have you heard of it? Er...it's a world just like this one where I shake your hand, and there's another world where I stab you and there's a world for every different thing I could do to you. It's...rather tricky to get your head around. - Is this Isobel? - Yes, aye. Yes, I'm the geek who got to marry the world's most beautiful woman. Very sorry to hear about the accident. Aye, five years now. March 12th. She was such a great rider, as I remember it. - How could it happen? - Well, she was. The horse bolted and threw her. And by all accounts, it was over in a matter of seconds. To look at her, you wouldn't have known. She was still so... perfect. You know, she just looked like she was sleeping. The main damage was to the brain, sustained on impact as her head hit the... ..hit the tarmac. - And you found her? - Aye, I did. "Do not trust the horse." I think Virgil said that. You weren't at the funeral. Of course you weren't at the funeral. It was a beautiful service. Humanist, of course. In fact, I've got a programme here somewhere. Hello! Zumba was cancelled. Have they finally all died of heart attacks? This is a friend of Isobel's, Jackson. This is my fiancee, Rachel. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. Let it get all dusty. It's a nice one, isn't it? She was just the same in real life. - Impossibly perfect. - Ah, found it. Rachel, I've started the tea, but the potatoes are being obstinate. I will beat them into submission. Aye. Hello, monkey. You must be hungry. - We're having chicken and mash. - OK. Why don't you join us for dinner? No, thanks very much. You should be with your family. I've got to go. I just wanted to come by, really, to say sorry. Yeah, well, it was extremely good of you to do that. Thanks, Jackson. And please, do come any time. Thank you. - Bye, Jackson. - Good night. What are you doing here? I told you he was looking after Freddie. Well, sometimes it pays not to take the obvious line of investigation. You said you were going to be out. I know, I know, I'm sorry, I just... All this, it's rather unsettling. I just want a normal life. A normal family life. How long have you and Andy been together? - Why? - There's a picture on the wall of you and Isobel with Freddie. You were the nanny before she died, right? Were you having an affair then? We fell in love. Rather unsavoury, isn't it? Less Maria von Trapp, more the scarlet woman. Can't control your heart, can you? - Did Isobel find out? - No. No. I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier, I was embarrassed. You will keep following him, won't you? Find out what's going on. Sure. She lives! The creature lives! How we doing? Listen, I... I've got to work tonight. Sorry. It's OK, Dad. I'm old enough to look after myself. No, you're old enough to think you can look after yourself. You're not actually old enough. Here you are. Come on. Get that down you. Is there any Vegemite, Dad? Do they even sell that here? You don't have to take me to school all the time, Dad. I like taking you to school. But you're "helicoptering" me and it's not healthy. I'm what? "Helicoptering you"? Hovering about me. I've got friends, I can walk with them. Well, I don't know them. Who are they? Emma and Sophie. I'm going to Sophie's after school for dinner. Hang on, I've got to call Sophie's mum and make an arrangement. Dad, it's all organised, OK? Give me my bag. You stay here and I'll be fine, OK? All right. Have fun! Morning, boss. I took the liberty of ordering you a coffee. I don't know what you like, so I got you a cappuccino. I hope that's OK. I did tell them to hold the chocolate sprinkle because you didn't seem to be a chocolate sprinkle kind of person. Not that I know you from a bar of soap. Well, actually, I do now, obviously. If you don't like cappuccinos, you can totally have my peppermint tea. Not a problem. I don't usually do caffeine as a rule, boss, makes me a bit manic. Actually, makes me a bit funny in the head. Just like to be clearheaded at work, just be... Who are you? Zoe Chalmers, boss, your new DS. We've not met yet. Well, obviously, we have now. - Tell him to go away. - Excuse me, boss? Go away, just like that. "Go away, Jackson," into the phone. Detective Inspector Munroe's phone. DS Chalmers speaking. Louise, please. Go away, Jackson. Can I have a quick word with her, please. Tell her I'd like to ask her a favour. Go away, Jackson! Zoe, you're going to be quite useful after all. DS Chalmers, please. - CID. - Is that DS Chalmers? - Yes, sir. - You're new, aren't you? - Yes. - Aye, this is Detective Superintendent Fraser. I'd like you to run a PNC on a man called Andrew Marshall for me. Born June 7th 1974. Well, sir, he is mentioned in the in the fatal accident report of his wife. Filed 2007. Ruled misadventure. Anything else? Nope, nothing. Anything on a Miriam Baker, born... sometime 1945 to 1955? Yes, sir. One conviction from 1969. Tell me about James Garrick. What's that got to with anything? You threw a brick through his windscreen, and one through his sitting room window, narrowly missing his wife. - That's ancient history. - 1969. Three months after Isobel was born. I'm not the one under investigation here. - Miriam? - Brandy? Miriam! You asked me to look into something that might have been a murder. I have, I've found nothing. The only person with history of criminal activity is you. So, what's going on? Be honest with me. He was Isobel's father. Yes? - So? - So, is that relevant? He abandoned you? He should never have abandoned her. Instead, he went straight back to his wife and left us. I was 19. A girl needs a father. Kids need their mothers, too. Mm. A decent bloody mother. I was useless. I didn't have the first idea how to raise a child. And she knew it, too, obviously, because she never stopped screaming at me. All my friends were off travelling the world and there was I in a tiny flat with a baby. I'm sure you did your best. Maybe. I thought as she got older, it might change. That she might soften, stop screaming at me, stop punishing me. But... But even when she had a child of her own, she was so cold. She could be so cruel. Is that why you didn't say anything? Didn't voice your suspicions when she died? It was wrong, but it was easier. And it also meant that I could see Freddie. How do you mean? Last time I talked to her, she told me with some glee that she'd made a new will. So that if anything would happen to her and Andy, Freddie would go to Andy's brother. She explicitly said she did not want ME to take care of him. That I would ruin him. So you thought if Andy got convicted of murder, you wouldn't see Freddie again and you kept quiet. I'll tell you what I think. I don't think there was a murder. I think you kept quiet the first time to keep hold of Freddie and this time, you're speaking out, you're lashing out, doing anything you can to stop losing him again. - And I won't be part of it. - No, it wasn't like that! That's how it looks to me. I didn't like Isobel very much, but I did love her. And I did nothing for all that time. And for what?! I'm still going to lose Freddie. Then you turn up on my doorstep and... I just couldn't ignore it. So if there is anything you can do, anything left you can try, do it, please, not for my sake, but for Isobel. She deserves that. All right. - You got a tip for me? - Jackson. Thought I'd whetted your appetite the other day. It's not Joe Burns. - Then who is it? - I don't know. Did you put CCTV in the shop like I told you, - after we caught him? - Aye. - Twenty number two. - Twenty number two. Aye. Been glued to it like a bug-eyed nutter. Nothing to see there. Could it have gone missing between here, the shop and the bank? No. That cheeky water you were wanting? - Thanks. - What is all this? It's Jackson Brodie. The private investigator I was telling you about. I thought that was all solved. Well, it's bloody not. Let me guess, we owe you money. - Yeah. - How much do we owe you, Mr Brodie? 1,900 quid. Call it 1,500. He's saving up to be a miser. Stop your blethering, woman. I'll do it myself. I'll head to the shops, as you seem to be managing fine on your own. No. You're going to stay here. Somebody's got to man the stand while I give the big man a look at the horses. I think she's cheating on me. What, the money? With a fella. She's always going out with her sister and that. Last year, she couldn't abide her face. Now she's there three nights a week. What's that all about? You're asking the wrong person. You'll have to ask her. She's there and there and every which where, but here with her man, where she should be. Women, eh? Incomprehensible as racehorses. Remember, pal, scared money doesnae win. And never stake more than you can afford to lose. You want a horse with good odds. Good jockey, fair shot. That's me, right there. I cannae let you put 1,500 quid on that horse, Brodie. - Why not? - Look at his odds against, you numpty. Look at his form figures. He's a 40-1 no-hoper. Go for a sure thing. I love a long shot, me. Nobody's Darling. - What?! - He's drunk. You said you wouldn't keep doing this. Doing what? If he wants to throw away 1,500 quid, - that's his business. - It's our business! No, it's my business. It's my money. Fine. £1,500 on number eight, please. 1,500 on number eight. They're off. And straight into the lead goes the 2-1 on favourite, Morning Star... He's followed by Equaliser... and Gerry Jackson on My Good Friend. These four ahead by two lengths... ..and Morning Star has opened a lead of two lengths. My Good Friend is in second place... - How am I doing? - You're losing. ..and at the line it's Nobody's Darling by a short head from Morning Star... It's impossible. You psychic or something, pal? - Did I win? - Aye. - Did I win?! - Aye. - How much did I win? - 61,500. Sorry. It's all yours. What's going on? Where are you going? - To see my sister. - Your sister, eh? Going to buy her another fancy supper, are you? See what I tell you. I tell you that it's not on, not on. Thanks, sorry, thanks. Hey, excuse me. Thank you, wouldn't want to leave that behind. - You're very kind. - You're not leaving, are you? Right now. Yeah, it was a work bonding day. It's hard work, bonding. I need some food and some proper wine and I really need to get out of here. I'd love a glass of wine. Yeah? I would like to take you for a glass of white wine, although possibly in a taxi, I think I've drunk too much. - Yeah, I'd second that. - But it could be fun. I don't go home with drunk men. Neither do I. How about some food? That might sober me up. Thimble full of wine. I've got a car. Just don't puke in it. I liaise between the exhibitions, the historians and the archives. My job is to collect the assets. Sounds very cloak and dagger. The assets. So it's like the photographs that are mounted in an exhibition, or a sample of cutlery that was used in an old house. I collect all the work and then I get the documentation to prove it's authentic. It's like the evidence of the exhibition, to speak in private detective lingo. Thank you for that. I wouldn't have understood that otherwise. And you, Jackson, what cases are driving you to distraction? Are you ready to order? Can I have spaghetti alle vongole and I'll have double the vongole. And for dessert, I'll have the tiramisu. - You've ordered the dessert? - Yeah, it's the best bit. Thanks very much. My humble abode. It's... going through a bit of a reimagining moment. - Coffee? - Yeah, black and sweet. Hello, Father! Hey, Marlee is... back. You didn't mention you had a daughter. - He does. - I do and that's her and her name is Marlee and this lady's name is Charlotte and she very kindly gave me a lift home. - Hi. - Hi What do you want for your dinner? - I've already had dinner at Sophie's, Dad. - At Sophie's. Are you drunk, Dad? What kind of thing is that to say? Marlee's just started S1. S1? I hated S1, girls are so mean. Can't believe you were mean. - I was mean to the boys. - Now that I can believe. I'm going to go back upstairs and finish off my homework. I'll only be about an hour. So tell me when it's safe to come down, Dad, yeah? There's no need for that, thank you. Her mum's in New Zealand. Good. Good, that you said good. I like that. I should go home, Jackson - That is mean. - I have rules. Yeah? Yeah, we haven't shared enough cultural events together yet. Are you going to expand my mind? Maybe. - Good night. - I'll see you. Allo, Mackie, me old mate. How did you know that horse would win? I liked the name. I'm Nobody's Darling. At 40-1, rank outsider, never won a race in his bloody life, you expect me to believe you didn't know. I didn't know. Well you did something cos that wasn't a lucky bet. The other bookies think so too. What other bookies? I've called the BHA. And the bloody SID. There were other bets. So there's going to be an inquiry. You know, you switched horses or something. Don't you think you're going to keep my money, pal. What are we doing here, Dad? We are just talking a walk. Are you buying me a horse? Funny. I'm trying to find something to do together. You used to love animals when you were little. Yeah, Stuart took me riding a couple of times in New Zealand. - Did he? - Yeah. That was nice of him. Good old Stuart. Did you like it? I loved it. Jackson! Jackson! Dad, you're going deaf! - Hey, how you doing? - Good. Are you coming to Pony Club? - No. - Yeah! - Hi, I'm Freddie. - Marlee. We're just leaving, love. No, we're not, we just got here. How about you go do whatever you came here to do and I'll stay here with Freddie. - Where's the owner? - In that shed over there. I'll be back in a minute. Come on then. Isobel? She wasn't exactly a friend. She wasn't one of those friends you could just ring up and chat to. I'm getting the idea that she preferred horses to people. Yes, exactly. People didn't always... get her. - Why not? - Personally, I think they were jealous, you know, of how beautiful she was, winning everything. But she just needed to be challenged. I think that's why she was moving. Moving where? Leaving Andy? Well, I don't think she'd had a chance to... I don't think she'd figured it all out. It was kind of spontaneous. She was like that. She had a thing about the Borders. She asked me to look after her horses until she could move down there. I think she didn't want to deal with her mother. But that's all a secret. I really shouldn't be saying anything. Right, she's not coming back, Sasha. I know, but she didn't want to tell anybody. Did Andy know? I don't know. Good? Did you know, at my school there are no girls? There's loads of girls at my school. They're all horrible though. You should come there. Come on, let's go. But, Dad, I need to take back my things. No, it's fine, I can take them if you want. Thank you, Freddie. Just ignore him, he's always like that. Come on. Hey! Freddie! - Jackson. - Rachel. What are you doing here? I've brought my daughter, she's been riding. - You've been following us? - No, no. It's just... one of those weird coincidences. - Well? - Well, I... I don't think now is a good time for a chat, is it. If you know something, you should tell me. Is there ever going to be a good time to find out that my fiance is having an affair? He's not. He's not having an affair. Are you sure? Yeah. What's he doing? Where's he going? He's not going anywhere. Was does that mean? He went to see his ex mother-in-law. And other times he's just, he's just sitting around. I don't understand why. He doesn't want to come home. Bloody Miriam's been getting in his ear again, telling him not to get married, telling him not to move to Lancaster, saying it's not good for Freddie. It's exactly what Freddie needs, it's a fresh start. It's exactly what we need. Do you understand? Rachel? Andy. Hey. Hi, Dad. This is my daughter. Freddie's going to teach me how to groom a horse first. Not today he's not, love. Come on. Let's go. Yes, he is. We'll only be ten minutes. You'll just have to wait. - I said, let's go. - Why? Because I said so. Now say goodbye. First of all, you bring me here, which I know was for work, and then when I start having fun you tell me we're leaving. - It's not fair. - We'll see ya. Come on. What are we even doing here, Dad? You're going to stop sulking. We're going to have some cake and start enjoying ourselves, all right? - What do you want? - Anything? You can have it all until you're sick as long as you give us a smile, for God's sake. I'm sorry, all right, I'm here now, we'll have a good time. - Go on, I know you want to, Dad. - No, no. Right, what are we having? - Piece of chocolate cake. - Love it. And a scone and a couple of rolls to share? Is that all? - I'll just get rid of it. - Dad, leave it. - I'll just take a minute. She'll call all day. - You said, you would leave it, Dad! Miriam. Any news, Mr. Brodie? Can I come and see you tomorrow? It's not the best time. I'd really like to know what you've got now. Tell me, please. All right. I think Isobel was leaving Andy when she died. With Freddie? I assume so. I see. Yes, of course, that makes sense. Thank you. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's not proof. - Love you. - And some juice or something. Bye. Hey, who you talking to? - Mum. - What about? - What do you think? - I don't know. About how you're always working all the time, OK? Marlee, I'm a grown up and grownups work, that's what we do for money. I don't have the money to pay for everything you do. Mum says it wasn't about that though. She says that you have intimacy issues. Intimacy issues. She says you can't love anyone cos your mum never loved you. And that's why you got divorced. Christ, right, first of all, my mother did love me. And secondly, yeah, she wasn't well and I learnt to take care of myself and that's not a bad thing. Not like you having me running around cooking for you, washing and cleaning and everything. I was independent. You don't let me do anything on my own though, dad. Like what, what do you want to do? - Go to the mall, the movies... - What, now? - Yeah. - By yourself? No, with my friends. I'm not five any more, Dad. All right, OK, I'll give you a lift. Give me money and I'll get the bus. - I'm driving that way. - I want to get the bus, Dad. Here. Do you want to...? Charlotte. I hope this counts as a cultural event. It definitely counts. This is the biggest privately-owned collection of art in Scotland. They've got Rubens, Titian, Murillo, Raeburns. In fact, a couple of years ago they sold a Tintoretto for 10 million just to fix the roof. Got some Polish mates who would've given them a deal. Just think, these walls are worth millions. How would you like that in your bedroom? - What is it? - Nothing. I'll be back in a sec. Andy? I think you've broken it! Go away! All right, all right. Put that up against it. What are you following me for? I want to know what you said to Rachel, why she is so upset. - What did you say to her? - Talk to her. I'm asking you! Who are you? Why did you come to my house? You're better off talking to Rachel. You don't even know Isobel, do you? No, I didn't. - Hey. - Bastard! - Calm down. Calm down. - Get off me. - Get off me. - Calm down, I'm not going to hit you. - Now stop it, all right? - All right. Jesus. She was upset because I told her you weren't having an affair. - What? - She hired me. - I'm an investigator. - You're a bloody arsehole. Now I'm going to let go of you, don't do anything silly. God. She was right to be worried though, wasn't she? You've been avoiding her. You can't blame her for being suspicious. Given she was the affair when you first started, wasn't she? How did you know that? I know a lot more than you think, Andy. I was reckless. I know it wasn't fair on Rachel, I wanted to make it obvious, get noticed, make Isobel jealous. A waste of time. She never even looked in the right direction. That must've been very upsetting. She wanted to leave, I would've been furious. What are you talking about? She didn't want to leave. Who told you that? Rachel? I never said Isobel wanted to go. Why would she? Rachel... sees what she wants to see sometimes. She's a good person, she's great with Freddie and he dotes on her. I should never have told her I loved her. I should never have let it get this far. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, me too. I bring peas. - OK, put it on. - That's really cold. Now can you see me? Are you seeing double? I can't even breathe. I can't breathe. - Is that cold? - Yes, very cold. - Where's Marlee? - She's out, she's out with her mates, she'll be ages. We've got a 66-year-old male found dead outside his house. His name is Ian Thomas Mackie, he's a bookmaker at Musselburgh. We've got trauma to the head commensurate with a fall from that balcony up there, boss. Of course, the question is, did he fall or was he pushed? - Who called it in? - His wife, Marie Mackie, although she said she saw nothing, heard nothing. Found him dead this morning. - Where is she, this Mrs Mackie? - Inside. Did you hear any disturbance last night, anything at all? I said, I was at my sister Kath's house. And you were with Kath until...? About 11.00, our television programme finishes at 11.00. And then what did you do? I came home and went to my bed. Where did you think your husband was when you went to bed? I told that girl, we sleep separately. Ian snores. Can you think of anyone that would wish to harm your husband, - any enemies? - Take your pick. There's no sign of a forced entry. Your husband may have known his killer. Maybe he fell. Pretty difficult to accidentally tip over that balustrade. He was a clumsy drunk and he was usually drunk. Did that bother you? None of my business. Shit. Marlee. - Louise. - Can I come in? What do you want? This is Charlotte, a friend of mine, this is DI Munroe, an old colleague. - Come in. You're not old. - Stop talking. Are we in trouble, Detective? I need to talk to you about Ian Mackie. Your number was found in his phone records. You spoke to him yesterday. When did you last see him? At the track yesterday. And I did some detective work for him before that. He's an old drunk, you know. Well, he's dead, Jackson. Eh? What happened? Yeah, I'm going to need to you to come down and make a statement. - What, now? - Well, as soon as you can. Sure. Nice to meet you. - You all right? - Yeah. I'd better call Marlee, see if she's all right. Yep, yep. Come on, pick up. Pick up. Hey, where are you? What are you doing? Why did I have to call you? I was trying to be independent, Dad. Well, how did that work out for you? If you're so independent, why didn't you get the right bus home? I've no money left. You spent the whole lot, the whole 20 quid. On what? Stuff with my friends. I got you this. I thought you'd like it. Ya daft idiot. Now come here. There you are. Rachel, I'm so sorry. I can't go through with this. No. You don't have to move out straight away or anything, you can stay until you get yourself sorted out. I'm sorry. Mum! Morning. - You look terrible. - Thanks very much. Shouldn't you be discussing Man United and fishnets somewhere? Yeah, well, I've been there, done that and I did not want the T-shirt. Anything on Rachel Stewart? Yes, now, listen, Rachel Stewart has a postgraduate degree in Irish Literature but has only ever worked as a nanny. - Anything on the family? - Yeah. She lived with an aunt after both parents were killed in a car crash and when she was 15 she lived with a school friend's family so she has no family. Rachel? What did you say to Andy? He said the wedding's off. That he never loved me. This wasn't what I asked you to do. Try and calm down. Look, I'm sorry about that but isn't it better that he tells you now - rather than later? - No, no, it's not. You ruined my life. It's better the truth comes out now, Rachel, about everything. You've not been entirely honest yourself, have you? Let's meet for a chat. Come on. I don't want to talk any more, Jackson. I want to go home. I just want to go home. - Brodie? - What do you want? Jackson Brodie. We've got some questions for you about allegations of fraud in connection with the death of Ian Mackie. - What? - You can answer those questions - at the station, let's go. - I'm dealing with something urgent. - I'll come in later. - No, you'll come now. Let's go. I'm not comming in. I'm not under arrest, I'll come in my own time. It's not an invitation, Brodie. I want to talk to you now. - All right. I'm picking up my daughter. - No, you're coming in. - Get off me. - Jackson Brodie, you've now assaulted a police officer - and you're under a arrest. - Don't be an idiot. You're not obliged to say anything but anything you do say... Put him in the car, he knows how it works. You know, you could have a lawyer. You don't want a lawyer then? Just get on with it. HE LAUGHS You can have a lawyer, you know. Yep. Marlee. - Give me that. - Marlee, it's Marlee Let me get that. It's my daughter, give us the phone. Let's go. Ian Mackie's my case, what the hell do you think you're doing? Well, we have reason to suspect that Brodie's involved in a horse racing scam - and he assaulted an officer. - You're not serious. Well, if it bothers you that much you can sit in during the interview. I told you, I liked the name. - What name? - Nobody's Darling. You know, most people wouldn't bet £1,500 on a horse with that record unless they believed that horse would win so tell me, why did you bet on that horse? If I knew it would win, I'd have put more money on it, wouldn't I? I would have sold my house and put that on it, I was just lucky. So you were willing, expecting even to lose £1,500? - I was drunk. - What? During the day? Yeah, sorry, Mum, is that all right? I was very bothered. - About what? - A case. We believe you are involved in a scam to rob Ian Mackie of thousands of pounds - and now he is dead. - Well, I didn't kill him. You were the last person he called. Do you remember what you said to each other on that call? Yeah, he was annoyed that I had won all that money. What? He was annoyed hours after the event, not when you actually won it? He found out that a bunch of other people had put bets on the same horse. That's a pretty reasonable thing to be annoyed about. Or were those bets just coincidences too? I don't know. Hey! Why don't you go and find those people and ask them? Let's get back to the point here, nobody in their right mind is going to put £1,500 on a losing horse unless they know the horse is going to win. Well, maybe I wasn't in my right mind, maybe I was pissed and I wanted to give my money away. It's none of your sodding business. It's not illegal. Now you were working for Mackie. You've got the inside trade into his business, you put a bet on a horse with extraordinary odds stacked against it, your last phone call made by a man who's now dead, thought to be murdered. And all you can give me is - I was pissed. Mackie just fired an employee for stealing from him. The same guy has been ranting all over town he's going to get his revenge on him, no matter what comes. - Who? - Joe Burns. And that Mrs. Mackie knows more than she's letting on as well. Well, Marie Mackie was at her sister's house in Leith from 5.00pm - the night Mackie was murdered. - That's weird. I saw her in the New Town about 6.30, dressed up to the nines and she wasn't going to her sister's. Well, the betting committee has declared all bets are void. We'll be freezing access to the money in your account while this case is pending. Great. I feel better when I'm broke. - Yeah? - Hey. How's Marlee? Yeah, great. Er, we are actually sick of the office and going to the movies. Your daughter is tired of watching me work. I'll take her home and you can pick her up later. Right, thanks. You can get into a 15, right? Hello, this is Rachel. Please leave a message. Rachel, it's Jackson. I'm worried about you. I think we should talk. Give us a ring as soon as you get this. He was a dead ringer, boss. Nobody's Darling was switched for a very fast horse called Jupiter's Rings. Racing paperwork's forged and falsely licensed. Also the BHA's been getting calls all over the place. They just got a complaint from another bookie who lost money too. So Mackie wasn't being targeted. No, ma'am. That was the maitre d' at the Sky Bar at the Point Hotel. According to their credit card receipts, Mrs Mackie was there that night but she left at 8.00pm. So the sister lied. She doesn't have an alibi. It would certainly seem that way. And the thing is, she was there by herself. She ordered a bottle of champagne, drank it and then left. Maybe she got stood up. Or maybe she was celebrating her freedom while her lover bumped off her husband. Either way, she's been lying. Miriam, Miriam, put the gun down. This is between me and Andy. It's been a long time coming. You've got it wrong, I promise you, you've got it completely wrong. Put it down. Not until he tells me what he did to Isobel. - I want to hear him say it. - Nothing, I told you, she fell off her horse. I didn't do anything. Liar, you killed her, say it! It was Rachel. What? It wasn't him, it was Rachel. It wasn't an accident? I don't think so. You were right about that. You've got the wrong person. - She's got Freddie. - What do you mean? No, no, you were supposed to pick Freddie up from chess club. No, she called, she was picking him up straight after school, club was cancelled. She's got him. - I'm going to call the police. - Hold on, - she's not going to do anything to Freddie. - I'll call the school. Hello! What's going on? - Thank God. - Where were you? Rachel took me for an ice cream. She gave me this. A present for me. For the wedding, it was her dad's. - Did she drop you off? - No. I took the bus. Do you know where she was going, where she is? No, why? What's the matter, Dad? Nothing, sweetheart. - Come on, come on, let's go. - Why? What's happening? Let's get some tea. I'll explain. Let's go and get some tea. I can't believe it. Sorry. Can you give her a call? Yeah. She said she was going home. You haven't seen her all day, she didn't come home? No. Hello, it's Rachel. Please leave a message. Rachel, where are you? Please, call me when you get this message. - Anything? - No, no answer. - Where are you going? - I've got an idea. What is she doing here? Maybe she's meeting a man. Not very romantic, is it? Where do you get the money for all these dresses? - The business. - Your husband's business? - Our business. - You were a partner in it, were you? No, but I should have been. That's what marriage is about, isn't it? What's mine is yours et cetera. I've earned more than enough for all this. But you didn't use your wages to pay for it, though, did you? No, I took the money out of the till. As was my right. Did he catch you? Is that what you fought about? We never fought. I told you where I was. Yeah, you did. But you weren't at your sister's, were you? I've got a receipt from the Point Hotel showing that you were there, drinking champagne till 8.00pm. OK, so I was there. So why would you lie? Who was the champagne for? Who were you meant to meet at the hotel? Was it a man? Why do people always think that? What people? Did your husband think you were having an affair? I didn't care what he thought. You don't seem to care that your husband's dead. You have no idea what I care about. And you have no idea what it's like to be trapped with someone who doesn't care about you at all for more than 30 years. Is that why you killed him? That's why I went... to classy bars... by myself in lovely posh frocks that I bought for myself, got my hair and nails done, had a glass of fizz, treated myself like I was something special, just so someone... did something nice for me, just occasionally. And I didn't tell you because it's mine, it's nobody else's business. I think you came back from that hotel and he confronted you. He found out that you were treating yourself with money that he didn't think you deserved. He was going to stop the one thing in your life that made your marriage bearable. You started fighting. So did you push him? Did he fall? Is that how it happened, Marie? I found him in the morning. That's what happened. And unless Mackie has returned from the grave to contradict me, you're going to have to believe me. Is there anything else I can do for you? No. It's a delight. Rachel. Rachel, don't. Stop it. Stop it. Come here. Give me that, give me that. - Get off me. - Spit it out, spit it out. - Get off me. - Spit it out! Open up. Right. Have a drink. Why can't you just leave me alone? I just want it all to go away. Because of Isobel. You know all the worst things about me. I know you didn't mean to kill her. Whatever happened, I know it was an accident, right? No, it wasn't. She was destroying everything. You have to come back. Don't break up the family. Get away from us. Go back to Andy. Please don't take Freddie. - I'm not taking him. - You're not? You think if I don't take him you'll be a happy family? You'll always be the person who drove his mum away. You're the one that slept with Freddie's dad and broke up this family. You don't even love Freddie. - You don't love anybody. - Stop it, your scaring Lily. Isobel? Isobel? I swapped the horses. Nobody would believe Lily could've thrown her but Ollie could've. I thought it'd make it look like an accident. Good girl. Come on. Good girl. I'm the reason Freddie doesn't have a mother. They're probably telling him that now. She's not your Rachel, she's a monster. You're not a monster. I killed his mother. I wanted to hurt her and I did. And now they are all going to know what I am and who I am. They know you had a fight. They know you cared about them enough to be angry. I loved them so much, Jackson, I really did. I know that. Freddie knows it. It's all I really wanted, a family to love, a family of my own. And you deserve it. I know you had a rough start in life, Rachel. It's not fair. What will happen if I come back? I'm not sure. Will I go to prison? You might. I can handle that but I just don't think I could face them. You could face anything, if you're just honest. Come back with me, you can stay with me till things get sorted, whatever happens. What's that for? Making me feel human again. All right, here we go. How do I do this? Some of that, yeah? Some of that. Not on the same piece, Dad. Try this. Have I got to? You know what, that's disgusting. Here, have mine. Don't know how you can eat that. - Dad? - Yeah? - When Mum comes back... - When Mum comes back, yeah? I'll still have breakfast here sometimes, won't I? Yeah, course you will. Don't be silly. And we can have adventures on the weekend. Yeah, we can have adventures. But we'll have to keep the vegemite here, Mum hates it. We agree on something then.
