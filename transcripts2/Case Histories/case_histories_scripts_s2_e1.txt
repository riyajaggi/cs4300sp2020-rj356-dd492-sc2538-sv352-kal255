 After being duped into taking part in a kidnapping in Germany Jackson returns to Edinburgh feeling dejected,though he does acquire a dog. He is approached by Hope McMaster,an adoptee anxious to locate her birth mother, which leads Jackson to see retired cop Ray and his wife Maggie,who knew the adoptive parents. Soon afterwards an anonymous caller warns him not to investigate Carol Braithwaite,whom,Jackson learns was a prostitute killed in 1979. He visits the case officer,Tracy Waterhouse,now a security guard who has illegally taken in Courtney,the silent child of another prostitute,the latest victim of a serial killer. After corrupt ex-police chief Lomax threatens Jackson to back off, Tracy and her former colleague Barry explain that,after Carol's murder, Lomax appears to have spirited away her son,Michael,and Jackson meets another private eye,engaged by Michael to learn what happened. Barry tells Jackson exactly what happened when Carol was murdered,leading Jackson to work out who killed her. To assuage his guilt over the kidnapping he gives his fee to Tracy to start a new life with Courtney.

 Mama! It's OK. My name's Jackson. I'm going to take care of you. I promise. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Where's her mother? Sichern off. Hey, I'm meant to be handing her over to her mum. Hey! Wir werden es von hier. Mach dir keine Sorgen ueber das Maedchen. Tracy, can you go and speak to Superdrug Charlotte? She's missing about 18 boxes of tampons. Tracy? You what? Tampons, Superdrug. I heard you the first time, Rod, there's no need to shout "tampons" at me all morning. ♪ Up above the world so high ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star Hello. ♪ How I wonder what you are On your own? Y'can't be sitting there on your own, kidder. ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star... ♪ Courtney! You're really gettin' on my wick. C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! Look, no, no, babe, it's his freezer! There's no way I'm movin' his freezer! Ah, get lost. Come on, you, ya wee shite! Oy! Come on. Oy! If I was you, Mr Brodie, I'd be more concerned about the mess you made of things. Yeah, well, you're not me, are you? You get your colleague's share as well, since I doubt he'll be in a position to collect it any time soon. I hope it'll ease your mind. She was crying for her mum. You told me I was taking her to her mum. Which is what I was told. So it was the father. Custody battles are always ugly. Our job was to collect the child from the location and deliver her, which you did. I'm going to look into every bloody detail of this. You won't find them. I couldn't find them, even if I tried. They'll have new identities by now. It's just the way it works. You did a job, I did a job. We move on. I did not sign up to take a child from her mother. I don't recall you being very specific about what sort of job you were looking for when you contacted me. You would do anything, I thought. I presumed you needed the money. Flights to New Zealand don't come cheap. I do my research, Mr Brodie. Your daughter Marlee is 12 years old, she lives with her mother in Wellington, New Zealand. Get on with your everyday life, Mr Brodie. If you have one. Until next time. C'mon! Hey, you shouldn't be treating a dog like that. What's your problem? You're nothing but a pest. C'mon, you little shite, you! What's your problem? Hey! En garde! What? Colin. You ever do that to anything or anyone ever again, I'll find you and I'll kill you, got it? All right, man. All right. What about the wee dog? You can have it. Merry Christmas. You're doing my head in! I've had it! Courtney. Oi! Oi what?! What do you think, oi what? Kiss my arse. What did you say? Come here! Get your hands off me. Hey, hey, hey! Get off! Hey, hey, hey, ho. Don't touch me. Somebody like you doesn't deserve to have kids. Find out how long this skip's been here. Door to door on anywhere tonight with a view, OK? Barry? Uh, aye, sorry. I was miles away. Door to door, yeah? Do you think it was the same fella who killed the last one? She was a good-time girl as well, eh? We're not in the '70s, Barry, come on. Hi. How's Marlee? Yeah, better. I threw her bike in the lake. She was not chuffed. You fall off your bike as well? New Zealand must be a dangerous place. No, eh, this is from Germany. Gosh, Jackson, it's hard to keep up with you. Look, I need your help. You can't have it. You don't even know what I need your help for. I don't care what you need help for. Louise... Bye. Hey, move across. What's your name? The Ambassador. Fair enough. Move. Jackson Brodie. 'You're in trouble, pal.' Oh, yeah, why's that? 'Stop asking about Carol Braithwaite.' Who? 'Carol Braithwaite. You heard.' Apparently we're in trouble. Hey. Where have you been? Yeah, I'm all right, thanks. How've you been? Where have you been?! New Zealand, where do you think? Looking after Marlee. You have not been in New bloody Zealand. You disappeared after a couple of months. I went walkabout. So why not answer your phone for the last three weeks? The charger broke. You left New Zealand three weeks ago. Right. Slink off somewhere else to lick your wounds, because Louise wants to marry someone nice? I was working, actually. Did you get paid for it? What is that? The Ambassador. Do you want him? What's he eat? Ferrero Rocher? Patrick's not nice and reliable. Why would you say that? He's a bit of a tit, if you ask me. Don't touch my computer. Did you get paid for it? Hey, my laptop is charging. You won't have a laptop in a few weeks, Jackson. Do you know what I have been having to do? What? I've been working as you. Unless you want to extract your thumb from your anus and come up with some ideas... Mr Brodie? Have I come at a bad time? No! You're right on the minute, Miss McMaster. Come in and make yourself at home. Client. I booked her in. We need to have a serious financial talk... and behavioural. Any chance of a cup of tea? Glass of water? For the client. Mum, my adoptive mum, was a model during the '70s. She was... her name was Kitty Winfield. Gorgeous. She was. She gave it up. Came home, gave it up to be a good wife. Dad was a police surgeon in Edinburgh. They couldn't have kids, broke their heart. Have you got kids? Daughter. But then I came along, like a gift. It's why they called me Hope. When were you born? When did you come along? Beginning of 1979. They got the news at a Hogmanay Ball. Vicars and tarts. Not long after, they took me to Australia. Dad died, 1997. Mum last year. Sorry. I nursed both of them. If you've been given away, you see, even for the best of reasons... You have a... you don't stop grieving for it. Hmmmm. If I have a mum here, I want to know. Did you, they, keep in touch with anyone from back here? Always got a Christmas card from Ray and Margaret. Ray and Margaret? Don't know the last name. Scottish stamp though. Little lion in the corner. I've got to say to you what I say to a lot of people in your situation. Apart from the fact that I may not come up with anything - it doesn't necessarily always end in a happy ending. Happy or not, I want to know. I did it in the microwave, is that OK? Only don't have it straightaway cos somebody said it keeps on cooking in your stomach. Tummy. I don't really know much about microwaves. Yeah. Shut up. We knew Kitty and John from work dos and things. Work? Ray was a policeman. Oh, right. I mean to say, we were little more than acquaintances, y'know. I don't know why you're here asking. Did you send them Christmas cards? No. No. Oh. We never had their address. I remember they got a baby, but... Where were they, New Zealand? Australia. They would get a baby, of course. Kitty had everything, pretty much. What did they end up calling her? Hope. So do you remember any of the circumstances in which they got the baby? They got her and they moved. And the real parents, the birth parents? Car crash. Don't suppose you remember their name? They always had the luck. Ray and I, we'd thought about adoption, but... I'd had trouble with my nerves, you see, and, eh, myself and Ray were... they turned us down. You said the word "depression" in those days and folk'd run a mile. Now it's almost compulsory. We've managed all right. I'm a lot better now. Good. Look, I'll leave my card. If you do remember anything at all, please don't hesitate to give us a ring. I wish I'd been born Kitty Winfield sometimes. I wouldn't have swapped you for every Kitty Winfield in the world, Maggie. I've tried my best. Aye. Well, I'll let myself out. These look nice? What size are they? I can't tell what size anybody's supposed to be. Kids. All so fat. How old are you, Courtney? Are you four? Or are you a bit older, are you five? Courtney? Cut your leg off and count the rings. Do you want some crisps? Here you go. Hey, that's the pig off your rucksack. Will we get him? Yeah, will we get him? Huh, yeah. We're not really going to cut your legs off. Tracy didn't mean it. Tracy didn't bloody mean it. What's up, Trace? This and that. What's up with you? Same old thing. Sunshine and rainbows. Listen, have any kids been reported missing? You've retired. Have you not? Tracy? Hey, come here. Sit, sit. There you go, stay right there. And bugger off as well. Can I help? I'm a private investigator. My name's Jackson. Aren't you supposed to be meeting her at 2.00? Eh? Your appointment's not till 2.00. Eh, I didn't... Oh, well, go in, I'll see if I can find her, OK? Help yourself to her tea, if you like that kind of thing. Tastes like cobwebs to me but there you go, each to their own. Carol Braithwaite. Oh, hey, hey! Stay there. Stay. Stay! Shut up. Genius. Braithwaite. WPC Tracy Waterhouse, 1979. Hmmm. Smile. Come here, come on, come here. Get under there. Go on, get under there. Go on. Go on. You'll get me in trouble, go on. She's at a sexual harassment seminar. Well, huh, oh, all right. Ummm, thanks. I'm allergic. Just so you know. See me, I'm going to look like pink porridge oats in about two minutes. Guess you don't want him then? No, thanks. All right, come on. Hey. 'Hi.' Can you look up a Tracy Waterhouse for me? Police or ex. Edinburgh. 'You've got £20,000 in a bag here.' Yeah. 'Can I bank it?' No, you can't. Don't touch it. 'Why? Where's it from?' You're not still making appointments? Working as me, are you? 'No, and don't change the subject. 'OK, Tracy Waterhouse is at 67 Burnside Road. 'Where is this money from if I can't put it in the bank? 'What's wrong with it, Jackson?' OK, so what we're going to do is, we're going to play hide-and-seek, which is a really brilliant game, OK? Right, you're going to get in the cupboard, go on, get in the cupboard, and then you've won the game, all right? Sorry. What the frig are you doing larking about out there? Who are you? It's all right, Tracy, I'm a private detective. You called. I'm not interested in private detectives. It's about a young child you may have been in contact with. Right. Carol Braithwaite. What? 1979. Carol Braithwaite. Ring a bell? Yeah... why ask about her? She wasn't a kid. Why you asking about her? Who was she? Well, she was a good-time girl. The kind of good time that lasts for about five minutes and sets you back a couple of quid. She was killed. And there was a kid? She'd been done about three weeks before. January. It really stank in there. Even in winter, it really stank. I hadn't been long in the job. Me and Barry were always getting that kind of thing, newspapers jammed in letterboxes and flies swarming about. Aw, Christ! Tracy. Some bastard had locked it in with its mum for three weeks. Michael. Michael? A little boy? I think he must have gone out of his mind, he was only about three. He must have gone off his head, I mean, he didn't cry or anything, he was just like a stone. It's like the lights were off. Is it him you're working for? No, I'm looking for the parents of a little girl, but it's 1979, so I thought maybe... Hiya. Who's this? Eh... this is Courtney. I'm Courtney's nana. Hi, Courtney. Courtney, um, do remember you had that pizza before? Should we have another one? Let's go in the house. No, come on. Don't be silly. Let's go in, no? What you got there? Give us a look. Can I have a peek? Wow, is that off a silver tree? Courtney, do you want a biscuit? Yeah, come on. It's the only thing that keeps her quiet. Shame it wasn't Michael. Yeah. 'Hi, you've reached Hope McMaster. 'Please leave a message and I'll call you back.' Hope, it's Jackson. You haven't hired another investigator, have you? Look, uh... I need to come and see you in the morning. Don't get too excited. I was going to take you to Robin Hood's Bay. I've got a little cottage booked there. Go there for me holidays. Y'ever been to the seaside? Courtney? No, I suppose not. Right, well, we'd better get going. Or I don't suppose you ever will get to the seaside. She'll never take you. Come on. 'Police are hunting a serial killer after a body of a prostitute 'was found in the city's West Linton area this morning. 'It's the third woman to be slain in the city in the last month alone. 'Police have appealed for any members of the public...' Len, there's that Jackson man to see you again. '..With any suspicious people in their area.' Tell him to sod off. Says to tell you it's about Carol Braithwaite. When's that Pointless on, eh? I don't want to watch this crap. It's the news, Len. I saw the news yesterday. Right, I'm away oot. Right, will I call you a taxi? Aye, you call me a taxi to mind-your-own-business-Helen. Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Help! Help! Please! I'm here to help, Ray. What's the problem? All right. You're a brave man showing your face in here. Brave or stupid. The two aren't mutually exclusive, are they? I thought you did a good thing. Too many bad apples round here. Shouldn't have been you that got the sack. Thanks. Listen, eh, can I ask you about Tracy, Tracy Waterhouse? What about Tracy? She used to be your partner, right? Yeah, until she retired. So what? She got any grandchildren? No, she doesn't have any children. Neither do I. Any kids she takes care of or anything? Tracy? She's a spinster of the parish. I don't understand what this has to do with Carol Braithwaite. Eh? You left a message. You working for Michael? No. Who're you working for then? Someone called Hope. Hope. That's a woman's name. That is because she's a woman. Look, do me a favour. Lay off Tracy. You'll only upset her. Why? Well, because after we found Michael, they took him away, put him into care. Tracy, she wanted to follow up, make sure he was OK, but you know what it's like, you don't want to let go. Don't you? Hey. What? Nothing, I'm not here to see you. Oh. Oh, can you stop harassing these people, by the way? What people? Who am I harassing? I'm getting angry phone calls from Lomax. Eh? Len Lomax? Bent ex-Chief Constable Len Lomax? Aye, nothing was proved, yeah. He's calling about me? Aye. What's he calling you for? Maybe he thinks we're friends. Huh. Just stop harassing him, eh? I think someone's pretending to be me. Who the hell would want to do that? Sie ist meine Tochter! Mama! Excuse me. This room's off limits to the general public. It's top secret. I'm looking for Tracy Waterhouse. Ah, Mr Jackson. Jackson... is my first name. Your first name's Brian. No, no, my first name's Jackson. Jackson Brian? There's only one man who can get off with having a first name as a surname and a surname as a first name, and that's Elton John, pal. My name's Jackson Brodie. Private detective. You've been leaving messages. I'm getting pissing well fed up with this! Well, pissing piss, you've just missed her again, Brian. She's been in and out. She's away on leave. What was she doing here? She wanted an address. Whose? I'm not prepared to divulge that kind of information. 50 quid. All right then. Kelly Cross. Who's that? One of our regular shoplifters. Prozzie. She'll steal anything, from tampons to wheelbarrows. Why did Tracy want her address? Don't know. She got any kids, this Kelly? She's always got one tagging along. Right, ta. My name's Rod, by the way. Sorry? You never asked my name. That's no' very polite. My name's Rod. As in Rod Stewart. You've let yourself go a bit, Rod. Any other time I can help you, Brian, do feel free to pop in and kiss my arse. Hey, hey, hey! Hold on. Hello? Stay. Hey. Oh, Jackson. What were you doing here? I was looking for Tracy Waterhouse. What, the police officer? Perpetual Tracy? Why? I saw her this morning, she had a kid with her. I don't think it was hers. It might have been Kelly Cross's. What, you saw Tracy here? Tracy was here? No, we need to find out if Kelly Cross had a kid and if Tracy's got an alibi. Would you recognise the kid? Yeah. All right, meet me at the office. Is that your dog? No. Why? Do you want him? No, park it before you come and see me. No, of course, I completely understand. We're here to ensure that marriage can be built on trust. Yeah, you will receive a full written report, photographs, and if... S-s-sorry. Of course, of course! Take your time. OK, OK, bye. Hey, come here. Hi. Border terrier. That's a nice dog. Ever been to the Borders? Just down the A68. I don't drive. I think they're even more beautiful than the West Coast. Mr Brodie's dog? Yes, can I help with anything? He's not here then? No, no, he's not. Can I help with anything? I think I can find him myself. Thank you, Deborah. Sorry, have we met? Hello! Hi! Excuse me! What is going on? Kelly had one daughter. Courtney. Any news on Tracy? She's still not home. But she was at work during the other murders, so it's not her. Whatever you say. I feel like you want an apology from me, Jackson. I've said nothing. I don't need to apologise, I don't need to explain myself. Did I ask for either? It takes more than half a sentence on my doorstep on Christmas Day. It wasn't me who said it. You made me say it. You made me say it to you. I'm just saying, it wasn't me, was it? Then you bugger off for two months to New Zealand. Because my daughter broke her arm, had an accident, so you want me...? Mmmmm, OK, it's just I called you. When did you call me? OK, look, that's Tracy Waterhouse with Kelly Cross. And that's the kid I saw. Did she just buy that child? Yeah. Why do you always have to complicate things? I don't mean to. Well, could you just maybe leave it with me now? Sure. Cos you're good at leaving things with me. Put that money away. Tracy Waterhouse, where would she run to? Friends, family, bank accounts, previous holidays, that kind of thing. Jennifer. Munich. Kidnap. Not now. Jackson, what did you do? Well, you're a detective, aren't you? Work it out. Well, did you kidnap someone? I did a job. I took someone from somewhere to somewhere else. All right? Against their will? I don't know, I'm not sure, maybe. What do you mean "maybe"? I mean I don't know if... I did the right thing. Jackson, this isn't your sort of job. Well, it's done now, I can't change it, so just forget it and put that away. What, but we could call... No, there is nothing to be done. Just leave it. Well, I... Bloody leave it, will you! I'm going home. Hey, hiya. Where the hell have you been? Up to no good. Surprise, surprise. Thing is, when you say that, you actually mean it, don't you? So what have you got to tell me? What's going on? Well, Mum is a bitch. Excuse me? She's a bitch. And Stuart's a dick. You wash your mouth. You think he's a dick. That's not the point, I don't go around saying it, do I? Why... She's not, but why would you call your mum that? Cos she grounded me. You never grounded me, Dad. No. I miss you. I miss you too. Wish you were here. I don't like it here. I know and I'm sorry. It's just the way things are. It's Stuart, he beats me, Dad. No, he doesn't. Well, I still don't like it. Look, I've got to go. No, no, hold on! Bye. No, no, no, no, hey, hey! No dogs allowed. Come on. It's not you, it's a little boy. What? Yeah, his name's Michael, I made a mistake. It was 1979, he went missing, he... so I thought... Are you sure it's not me though? It's really not you. It's the same look in the eyes, though. Look, I hate saying this but I don't think there is anything I can do for you. It's only been a day. I know, your adoption papers and your birth certificate are forgeries. So you don't have any official records and I've explored the one thing I could. I don't want to take your money for no reason. Honestly, Hope, I think the best thing you could do for yourself is work out how to get on with your life. Sorry. No. Night shifts. We had a nasty suicide. I'll keep thinking. And if there is any other angle, anything, I'll call you, I promise. You don't want a dog, do you? No, I want a mother. Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't help. I guess that couldn't have been me anyway in the photograph, I would have been a baby then. Oh, yeah. Good luck. Oi, baw heid! You talking to me? Can you no' take a telling? Eh, do you know why I'm here? No, Mr Lomax, I've no idea and I don't care. Ray Strickland. What's he got to do with anything? His wife killed herself. Eh? He was lying in the hall like an upturned beetle! And she's lying in the bath bleeding to death. Jesus! You went round there, stirring up shite about Carol Braithwaite of all people! I did not go there to... Do you know what? It's none of your business why I went there. Tell him I'm sorry for his loss, will you? I'll tell him friggin' nothing. Who put you up to this? No-one put me up to anything. Barry Crawford? What? You walk away from this. Get your hands off me. I don't take orders from you. Wait. That's it. Last one. Oh, no, hang one, there's another one. Got it, right, let's have a look, very good. Now, don't be asking me to put plaits in, because I'm rubbish with plaits, I've always had fingers like sausages. Doesn't mean you can eat 'em. Well, look at you. You look lovely. Do you want to see? What do you think, Mrs Shiny Hair? Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest? It's got to be Courtney, hasn't it? Fingernails. Oooh, look at them. What's under there? You could grow potatoes under there! Do you like potatoes? Do you want to have some potatoes? Barry. Hi, how you doing? Good. Great. Can I come in? I'd like a bit more about the Braithwaites. Can I come in? Barry, sorry, I was just going to say, y'got any spuds? Did you kill Kelly Cross? Course I didn't. I see why you got the sack. Bloody rubbish detective you'd make. But you did kidnap her daughter, didn't you? I paid for her daughter. What, fair and square? Oh, shut up! I was taking her back. That's what I was doing there, I was taking her back. Why would you take her in the first place? What were you thinking? I wasn't thinking! Her mother was knocking seven shades of shit out of her and I was trying to stop her. Which I did. I happened to have a load of money in my bag, as I'm having a new kitchen put in. I had £3,000 right there. It was a moment of madness. You could have called Social Services. Look, I just wanted to get her away. For a bit. Show her life wasn't all... And I was going to give her back but when we got there, her mam was dead. I mean, properly dead. Courtney didn't see. I just... I called Barry. She did. So what, you can't just buy a kid. He's right, Tracy. But if I hadn't, if she'd been in that flat 24 hours later, she'd have been dead too! So I've made my bed, I'm going to have to lie in it. What does that mean? Eh? Think about it, what do you think is going to happen now? Look, Tracy, Barry said you were very affected by what happened with Michael Braithwaite. This is nothing to do with Michael Braithwaite. Well... What happened to him? What? Tracy? Len Lomax turned up first. He went in the ambulance with Michael. He was such a little thing, you know, being in there all that time, weeks and weeks, with his... mum. He should have had help, you know, counselling you call it now, but then... Len Lomax? You know, what happened, it knocked us sideways, didn't it, both of us. Finding Michael like that, then losing him... We went the next day to find him cos they said he was in the children's hospital. But that was it, he'd gone. He'd just disappeared. What do you mean? Did you try and find him? Yeah, but nobody had any paperwork on him, not the adoption, not Social Services. What about the police? What was Len Lomax doing there? In those days, y'didn't ask, you didn't barge intae a chief superintendent's... No, but maybe we should have. Get the kid away. Now hold on a second, ho, hey, just wait a second. Come on, down you get, get your bag, get your things. Hey, Alpha, round the front. Now stay there. Hey, you, Brodie. Come here! Hey, you. Where do you think you're going? Mr Brodie, I presume? My name's Jackson. I'm a private investigator. I think this was meant for you. I got your dog some sausages as well. I hope you don't mind. Aw, thanks. What's he called? The Ambassador. That's an unusual name. I thought that was a name for a bigger dog. Aye, well, he's big inside, I suppose. I have a very normal name. I'm called Brian Jackson. I guess that's where some of the misunderstanding might have come from. Two private investigators called Jackson. Asking about Carol Braithwaite? Hmmm. So who's your client? He's a man who was... he grew up in children's homes, fostering. I traced that he came from Scotland, but there wasn't much to go on, records... Do you think it's Michael? Yeah, might be, he can't remember much about where he came from. One thing he does remember is a mother. Couldn't put a face to her, he remembers her being very sick. He remembers watching Play School when some policemen came. Y'know she was murdered, don't you? Little Michael sat in the flat with her for three weeks with the body. Yeah. Well, he's not going to find his mum then, is he? He's not looking for his mum. What's all this? This all yours? Oh, yes, indeed. Where do you get it all from? Catalogues. You must get the catalogues. They go out to all the BAPD members. The what? BAPD. You not a member? I'm not much of a joiner-in. How much do you charge then? 200 an hour, plus expenses. Christ on a bucket. Well, if you stretch it out, these things can add up. I'll bet. So you weren't asking about Carol Braithwaite at all then? No, no, so, if he's not looking for his mum, who's he looking for? Oh, I forgot the receipt. What? Breakfast. It's an expense, isn't it? Back in a jiff. You sneaky little bastard. Hey, come here. Hey, come here! Come here. Get in, go on. Oi, oi, oi, oi. Actually, I'll take one of them an' all. I'll take one of those lollies. Thank you. Thank you. There we go. There's your ice cream. Oh, and I got you that. Don't you like whistles? You can eat it. You know, I was brought up round here. When we were little, we used to go to all the rock pools. And you could see little starfishes in them, and sea anemomes... amemonomes... Anyway, the little red wavy things. Courtney, if you could have anything you wanted, like you could have any treat and it might be the last time anybody asked you, what would you have? I'm not 100% sure what we're going to do. I've got me house. I could sell me house. Maybe we could go to Argentina like the Nazis used to. Don't know why I mentioned Nazis, I don't suppose you even know what Nazis are. Skipping rope. What did you say? Skipping rope. Red. OK, yeah, I think we can manage that. Or maybe not. You can't do it, Tracy. Why can't I? What sort of life would she have had? That's not the point, I'm not going to let you. But you're not a copper any more, any more than I am. Here, boy! Let's take her back to Edinburgh and give her back to her family. I'm not going back to Edinburgh, I know where I need to be, and it's here, near her. She's got a father, she has to have a dad. You think? Where's this dad when the mum was knocking hell out of her? She was covered in bruises. You really think she's got some granny at home, getting the dirt out of her fingernails and reading her bedtime stories and putting her to bed? She's got nobody. You don't know that. I do. Barry checked, they are either dead or they're in prison. You're not thinking clearly. Look at the two of you, you're not going to go on the run, are you? You're not going to make a kid disappear. No? If this is about Michael... No, I keep telling you, it's not about Michael. Well, it's got to be. Be honest with yourself, it must be, right? You walked away with someone else's kid, that's not normal. All right, I know what you are trying to get me to say. I was bothered about Michael. Which is OK. Yeah, but Barry kept saying I was too naive and it wasn't our job to... And I just wanted to make things different. I get it. No, when I saw her, I just wanted things to end differently and I know that was probably wrong and I... I'm not a bad person. I never said you were. You're not a bad person, come on. Tracy! What, pet? Look, the dog! Here, boy. I know, I know, it's his doggy. Here, boy. Here, boy. She's got nobody. I can love her. I can love her. All right, stay here and I'll see if I can sort something out. What? I don't know. Something. Everything, maybe nothing. I'll find you. You've got money? Don't use your card. No, no, I had thought of that. Where's my car? It's up there in that car park, it's a bit dirty, sorry. Hey, Courtney, we need to take the dog back. Why, eh? Why did this happen? Where's Tracy and the kid? Come on, you know something, don't you? Something you never told about Michael Braithwaite or Carol. What is it? Aye, you're right. What is it? Where is Tracy? She's somewhere and I can look after her, if you tell me what is going on. What happened? It was a rotten place back then, a rotten place to work in. I was always so close to saying something, like you said something. What happened? It was the Policeman's Ball, Hogmanay, 1978. I was on taxi duty, just to avoid any drink-driving scandal. Not that that mattered a big deal. Come on, ya stupid bitch! Who do you think you are? Ray Strickland, he was a complicated guy. He was well on with the drink. I was a constable, he was my sergeant. Come on, I need a lift. Aye, all right. Calm down, eh. So he nabbed me. And, eh, he got me to drive him somewhere. Carol Braithwaite's place. He came out of there in some state. So I took him back to the party and Ray and Len talked and they told me to beat it. Three weeks later... I thought... Ach, I don't know what I thought. Len and Ray weren't saying anything so I asked, I asked Len. I said, "What happened with the boy? Did you leave the boy in that flat? "And the mother, who killed the mother?" And? He tore a strip off me. He says if I thought he'd left the little boy there to die, I must be mad, and the mother, she was a prostitute... Ray'd just fancied... it was well known back then that he put it about a bit. He'd just... he'd gone in there, found her there and he panicked. So Len went back with him, they cleaned up, they locked up, left it for some other poor bugger to find her. You know, the ones that always deal with the swarms of flies. And he told me there's no point getting Ray mixed up in it. Did Tracy know? Did you tell her? It's eating me up, this is eating me up. They said to me, "If you value your livelihood, shut it, forget it. "If you value your family's house and the meals, you forget it. "You tell Tracy to forget it too. You get that to happen. "If you feel anything for her." Which I did, which I do. So I try my best to... bury it. He's alive, Michael Braithwaite. He's back and he wants some answers. Uh, Tracy Waterhouse... Doesn't matter. No friends, no family, no holidays. Don't need it. Find me everything you can on Carol Braithwaite's murder, police statements, press clippings, anything, e-mail it to me. Sorry. Huh, it's my job. No, I meant about before, blowing up here. I'm sorry. I'd already forgotten about it. Thanks. What am I missing? Eh? I'm missing something. Get some grub before the vultures descend, eh? This is where we had the Policeman's Ball. Aye, aye, it's free. I still know some people. Hi, how you doing? My condolences, Mr Strickland. Piss off! There was a little girl there, wasn't there? Did you not hear what I said? New Year's Eve, 1978. Carol Braithwaite's flat. Would you like the rest of your face rearranged, pal? Can we go into another room? We're not going in any other room. She's your daughter, isn't she, Ray? Eh? You took your little baby girl out with her and you kept her safe. Well, she's all grown up now. She's about ten there. She's a woman now. She wants to know where she comes from, she wants to know what happened to her mum and dad. What should I tell her? Ray? What shall I tell her? So you were having a thing with Carol Braithwaite, right? Probably let her off a bust in return for favours. Isn't that how it works? Then you got her pregnant, right? Carol Braithwaite was a whore. So she got what she deserved? Going to give us break, you two? Gie's a break! I'm keeping that bastard off yer back, Ray. Like I've been keeping the bastards off yer back this past 40 years! Did you kill her? Ray! Did you kill Carol Braithwaite? She had a wee girl. Francesca. I didnae want to see Carol. But... Maggie and I didn't have any bairns, no matter how... I tried not to, but I couldn't stop myself from seeing Francesca. The baby. You know. I couldn't stop thinking about her, she was so, so... She had such... she had such blue eyes. Right. Enough. But Carol, see, Carol wanted money. And it got to so that she said she'd tell Maggie if I didn't... And she'd... she'd stop me seeing Francesca. I got so steamed up and drunk that Hogmanay. That's it, Ray, get out, you're never coming back here. Get out my house! He sorted it. That's the last of it. You cannae keep her, Ray. Talk sense! You cannae keep her, it's no' right. Now get in the car. Ray! John and Kitty did all right by her. Sure they did. Me and Maggie would have done all right by her. Aye, you'd just killed her mother. If you'd been smart about it, you could've had your whore and your daughter on the side, if that's what you needed. We all had whores on the side. What? Present for you, Kitty. From Len Lomax. Hi. Oh, my God. She's beautiful. Aye, aye, she is. Did you tell your wife? I told her the day I saw you. Why? I couldnae've... I could have loved it. I could've learned to love it. Maggie... Oh, God! We could have had a life, Ray! There could have been life. There could've been colour. We could've laughed. There could've been wax crayons and... There could have been just something, Ray. Ah, Christ, Christ, Christ. Maggie! Anything but the life I've had. Maggie! You think you're going to be a daddy now, after all this? You've always been too soft, Ray. Always have been. The two of you just left a little boy in there, did you? Just locked him in with the body? What kind of men do you think we are? I thought he was with his father, that's what we thought. We didn't think it was going to take three weeks to find the body. That was police incompetence. Where's my daughter? Can I see her? Well, that will be up to her. What are you gonnae do? Brodie? Brodie! What are you gonnae do?! Thank you. Ah, Mr Brodie. So... what can I do for you? I was hoping you might be able to arrange, um... I need some new passports, identities, sale of the house and the money to be moved untraceably. The whole thing, basically. For who? For a couple of friends of mine. It's very costly. 20 grand cover it? No. That's all I've got. Then maybe we can come to some other arrangement? Like what? 20,000, Mr Brodie. Plus an acknowledgement that you owe me. And that one day I'll give you a call. No, I'm not working for you again. I can have two whole new identities for you in 24 hours. Bank accounts. Social security. For anywhere in the world. In 24 hours. Fine. Thank you, Mr Brodie. You've got my number. I certainly have. Mama! Mama! Mama! Where's her mother? Sichern off. Hey, I'm meant to be handing her over to her mum. Hey! Wir werden es von hier. Mach dir keine Sorgen ueber das Maedchen. Hi, Michael. What's she called? Hope. I'm glad he found her. Can you tell Michael that he wasn't forgotten? Yeah. Hey. Think you've forgotten something. Thank you. I'll make sure the money from the house gets to you. Yeah, and I know how much those houses go for, so don't try diddling me. I wouldn't dare. Anyway, thanks. Say goodbye to Jackson, Courtney. Goodbye. Bye. Lucy. It's the name on the passport, like you asked for. Do you like Lucy? Lucy. If I was going to have a little girl, I was going to call her Lucy. And what am I called? Michaela. Bloody hell! Michaela! And Lucy. Yeah, well, I'll have to get some leopard-skin leggings. Good luck. Come on. Yes, m'lady? Ah, I just wanted to know if you'd got anywhere with Tracy and Courtney Cross. It's just that they've both disappeared. And apparently Tracy's house is up for sale. No, nothing, trail went cold. Could you look in my eyes and tell me that? Louise. I've got nothing, the trail went cold. OK. Is that why you called me in? It is. You got him then? Yes, serial killer. Good job. You look knackered. Ach, well, there's a reason for that. Anyway, congratulations. Thank you. Do you want a drink? Don't mind if I do. Bit of old-fashioned police work. Rough justice. Married life. So what's he like then, your Patrick? Seems a bit boring to me. Well, Patrick is funny and thoughtful, and a very good doctor, and he's clever and he makes me feel better than anyone's ever made me feel before. Well. And anyway, I'm not so interesting myself. You found out all that pretty quick, didn't you? And what is it that you think you are, Jackson? Are you enthralling? Well, you'll never know, will you? Couldn't take the chance. That's not a chance, Jackson, that's Russian roulette! Sounds exciting. You're not exciting. You're boring. It's boring. This is boring. And now I'm going home to my fiance. Congratulations. Well done on the case. Hi, Dad, it's me. Missed you. Hey, how's it going? Yeah, I'm good. How's it going with...? OK. Great, in fact. Mum's got the sack. You what? Her firm's moving to China. Oh, that's terrible. Wha.. She... she's not going to China, is she? No. She's moving back to Edinburgh. With you? What do you think? That's fantastic. When is that happening? In a month, but I told Mum I didn't want to wait, I want to come back sooner, so I can stay with you. What did she say to that? She said it was a mad idea, and that I wouldn't like it. I said I would like it and wanted to stay with you for ever and see her at the weekends when she got back. Then she got all upset or pretended to, but then she said I could. She said I could, Dad. What do you mean? Well, I bet she was upset. She was a bit, she said it will all go wrong and I will come running back to her but she's wrong, it won't, will it, Dad? Well... oh... You could be a bit happier. No, I am. Look, I am. It's amazing. It'll be brilliant. I can take care of you. You don't have to take care of me, sweetheart, that's my job, to take care of you. So, OK if I tell Mum? Yeah, of course, what you do you think? Yeah, yeah, get her to call me. Amazing. Right, I'm going to go pack. Love you. Love you too. Jackson Brodie. I can't let you put £1,500 on that horse, Brodie. Why not? Did you have another child while I was away, Dad? What the hell do you think you're doing? I don't know what you want from me! Mum says you have intimacy issues. Intimacy issues? I don't go home with drunk men. Neither do I. Jackson, have you been following us? What's going on? Be honest with me.
