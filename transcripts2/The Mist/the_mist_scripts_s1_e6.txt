 Is everything okay, man? [Bryan yells] [grunts] - [grunts] - [howls] [Bryan screams] [screams] [gagging] Tell me who I am. Tell me who I am! - They will... find you. - Who? [groans] - [choking, gasping] - All right. Kevin. Where's your brother at? How did it happen? Does it matter? - It could be important. - He's just dead. That's all you need to know. NURSE: Dr. Bailey. DR. BAILEY: Excuse me. [whispering] We've lost another patient, this woman over here. She came to look for her husband in 227. You were the last to see her. [Dr. Bailey whispers] Yeah, you stay. I'll go. What's going on? Oh, it's nothing for you to be worried about. You kind of suck at lying. It's fine. Everything is fine. We've got it all under control. I just want to know if there's something I should look out for. There's nothing to look out for. It's just we've... we've had a few patients... disappear. Disappear? Like, from inside the hospital? Yes, but it's possible they left on their own accord. We're severely understaffed right now, and it's really hard to keep track. We're leaving. What? Now? We can't go. Bryan is still really messed up. He's got Mia. He'll be okay. Okay. There's something I gotta do first. Okay. I could have done something. I could have held her and protected her. There's nothing you could have done. That thing in the bookstore, it took her and didn't want me. Why? Why did it want her and not me? Alex. It's because there's something wrong with me, isn't it? Come on. Let's go. Where? Field trip. I remember how much Liza liked coming here... and Jay. But I think he was here more for the doughnuts than my sermons. What's on your mind, Father? I was gonna ask you the same thing. I remember, like it was yesterday... when you asked me to be there with you and Liza. I was so honored you wanted me there for her final hours. I'm glad I was there for you after she passed, for you and Jay. We appreciated it. Liza was loyal to God till the very end. She knew she was dying, yet she didn't hate Him. She loved Him for the life He had given her. Please don't let her down by listening to Nathalie. Father, you're needed. She's talking about the Black Spring again, and they are listening. [Nathalie speaking indistinctly] Father. [organ playing] [clatter] [discordant notes] [silence] - Hi. - Hey. We're leaving. It was interesting, you know, what we did. What, me beating the shit out of you? Yeah, that was interesting. See you around, I guess. Yeah, see ya. KEVIN: No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Where's the car? Adrian? - I gave you the keys, Adrian! - I don't have them! I... I swear I had them near me when I... I... - Where are they?! - Mia! Mia must have taken 'em. - The Jeep's gone. - Gone where? Mia took it! Did you know? No, she didn't say shit to me. Why the hell did I trust her? Where are you going? - I need to find another working car. - I'll come. No! Just... Just... I'll be back. Just stay here. [turns knob] [turns knob] [door creaks open] [faint clatter] [woman sobbing] Come on! Show me. ALEX: One sec! Did you already try the purple one? I don't do purple! I hate the jacket. I love it. If the thing in the mist doesn't want me, I could go find help. - No. - I could find Dad. Alex. I just miss him. I know. [both laugh] [tires scrunch] [clatter of rummaging] [clank] [shovel scraping] [scrabbling] You came to talk with the crazy lady. [Heisel laughs] Well... I don't have enough crazy in my life right now, so... [laughs] What's wrong? Mm... I'm just thinking about how it's changed everything. Well, I thought you said all this was beautiful. Oh, it is. So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it. So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again? Yes, of course. And it will... once it has what it came for. What do you think it came for? A forest ranger I knew years ago told me about a mother brown bear who gave birth to three cubs. The rangers stayed nearby to keep an eye on them and make sure the cubs were safe from other predators, but they were shocked when the mother killed the first two cubs. They intervened and took the last baby, a male. Why did it do that? Well, while they were caring for the cub, they discovered that it was suffering from fever and infection. It was sick when it was born. They thought the mother killed the others because they were diseased, too. She killed them so they couldn't spread the sickness and life could continue on. We're the infection, aren't we? Mm. Not all of us. Humans are nature, too. Something's wrong. I promise I'll tell you when I know. Thanks, crazy lady. It worked for a second. What? The distraction. I still hate that jacket. Maybe we can distract the others as well. Come on. I have an idea. I think I'm gonna head back to the loading dock, show off my new clothes. I'm gonna throw out that jacket when I get back. No, you're not. I love you. I love you, too. Hey. Straight back, okay? [lantern clatters] [woman sobbing] [wailing] [wailing] [wailing continues] Dr. Bailey. [sighs] Don't just stand there! Help me with her! - What's going on? - I just found her like this. I'm gonna need to sedate her. It's all right, Gwen. It's all right. - What the hell is all this? - You have no idea. [muffled wailing] [choking] [muffled] No! No! [electricity crackling] Generator's running dry. Don't worry. Kevin's coming back. He's been gone over an hour. I'm sure he's fine. People are disappearing. Nurse Shriver said three people have disappeared in the past couple days. What do I do if he doesn't come back? All right. [groaning] [sighs] Let's go find him. [grunting] [panting] I'm sorry... but it's been days now. So many people have died, and so many more will, unless someone can find a way to stop it. I'm trying, but I can't find a solution without... experiments. I'm not a psycho. I'm really not. The woman you found, she was already dying. So were the other people. And I never would've done anything to you if you hadn't... We have to act now. Whatever it is out there... it's changing its behavior. It's getting smarter. Father. It's only getting worse. You should be out there trying to save them. I should. I just don't know how. Maybe we can ask her to just stop talking. [chuckles] I don't think that would help. You can be very persuasive, Father. The church has persuaded people in the past. Those were horrible things to do. I know, but if they had a purpose... if they helped save other people's souls... You said it yourself. The day of judgment is here. Nathalie's soul may be lost, but we can save the others. You can! I cannot do what you ask of me. I can. The Lord will forgive me. He will see that I mean well. Don't give me your permission. It's better that way. [breathing heavily] Okay. [door bangs shut] [knob rattling] Hello? Hello! Is anyone out there?! [grunting] [splashing] Aah! Somebody help me! Help! Help! What's going on? I could ask you the same thing. Everything has to be a pissing contest with you, doesn't it? People call you bitch long enough, one day, you decide to act accordingly. How did we get here, Eve? What is this? It's hope. _ Need some help? Help! Please! MAN: Alex! Alex, is that you? Please help! Please! I'm coming! [thumping] Help! Jay, please hurry! [coughing] [inhales sharply] ALEX: Jay, hurry! Be careful! [groans] [grunts] - [panting] - Jay! [coughing] [gasping] - [coughing] - Are you okay? Yeah. Are you all right? [both coughing] Are you all right? How did you know I was in there? Did you do this? Did you lock me in there so you could play hero? What?! I heard someone screaming. I didn't even know it was you! Then who was it? How should I know? [scoffs] You really think I could have done this?! You know what? Fuck you, okay?! I do everything I can to be nice to you, to help. I just saved your goddamn life, and you just continue to repay me with paranoia! What were you doing here? [laughs] I was looking for you to see if I could stay at the loading dock. Are you crazy? No, but they are down there. They just threw Vic out of the mall. They're losing their minds. - [coughs] - Come here. You need to do something with your hands. [coughing] [clatter of rummaging] [clatter] [scritching] _ No. No. No, no, no, no, no. No. [panting] What... [country music blares] Shut up. ♪ Love that hair ♪ - ♪ Long and black... ♪ - Shut the fuck up! ♪ Don't cut it off, whatever you do ♪ ♪ I need it to run my fingers through ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're my baby ♪ ♪ Uh-huh-uh ♪ ♪ Don't mean maybe ♪ ♪ You're my baby ♪ [music continues] How can it... [music stops] [gasps] You can't do this to me. It's not real. I-It's not real. WOMAN: Would you even know? Mrs. Raven. Oh. Hello, Link. Father Romanov would like to talk to you. Why is Romanov up here? Oh! No, Link! [gasping] Link, where is Father Romanov? You're not going anywhere until you agree to stop this heresy. - What heresy is that? - You know what! You must repent and embrace God. - Link. - Repent, and embrace God. He said, "The Lord is faithful and that He will... He will strengthen and protect us from the evil one." You think I'm evil, Link? You're leading them astray. Embrace Him! It's His house! - You'll respect Him! - Link, let me help you. - No! - [grunts] I don't... want to hurt you, but I will until you repent. And I will hurt you much, much worse than this, and God will forgive me, 'cause I'm doing this for Him. No. No, no, no! No! No, no! No, please! Please! Please! No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! Please let me out! Open the door, please! Nathalie, please! I worked with a patient, uh, Marvin. He was suffering from dementia. 30 seconds after I exposed him to the mist, I heard a shotgun blast, and his chest exploded. I removed shrapnel from his chest cavity. And yesterday, I worked with Pam. 30 seconds later, dogs appeared in the mist, her dogs. She was so happy to see them. Then they ate her. It reacts to us somehow on a physiological level. I just don't know how yet, but if I can find out, then I can save people. This will slow your metabolism and your hormone output. Maybe I can slow how the mist reacts to us. If it doesn't attack after around 30 seconds, I'll know I'm on the right track. [muffled grunting] WOMAN: What's the matter, sweetie? Is your mind playing tricks on you? You must get that from me. I got nothing from you. How would you even know? You abandoned me in that horrible place. You... were supposed to take care of me. You're right. I wasn't a mother to you. All I ever wanted to do was to take care of you... but I was frozen on that sofa. I begged myself to get up, to go to you... but my mind wouldn't let me. I... BOTH: I needed you. [Mia sighs] No. I understood why you left. Deep down, I was happy. You were finally free of me. Mom? Mm, baby doll. Every day, I tried to say it, but I could never get the words out. Say what? I love you. - [crying] - I wish I had been better. Don't you wish you could have been a better daughter? Yes. Let me finally be a mother to you now. Let me help you die. I don't want to die. I don't. Oh, baby doll, yes, you do. You never realized, but we were always in this together. [choking back tears] I'm so tired. And you don't have to be any longer. You can stop running. There's no one waiting for you. You're wrong. Someone's waiting. [muttering] [Mia gasping] [mother raving] Stop it! [panting] [panting] [gasping] [engine roars] [tires screech] - [ticking] - A minute and a half already. It's working. It's working. [muffled voice] What? Who? OWL: What? What? Two minutes. Two... [grunts] - Get Kevin! - [Dr. Bailey groaning] [Adrian grunting] Hurry up! Kevin! - Help! - What are you doing? [gags] [grunting] Help! - Help me. - Get him up. Come on. Quick. Mom. Mom! No! I told you to stay away from her! Mom, stop! He saved me. Saved you? From what? What happened to you? I stopped in a sporting goods store on the way back. Someone locked me in the break room and started a fire. - You did this. - Look... Look at him. You want me to believe this? I don't care what you believe. Just quit blaming me for shit I didn't do. - He needs our help. - Gus can help him. He's scared of Gus! - They sent Vic out in the mist. - I don't give a shit. Here's the thing, Eve. Kind of fed up with you trying to decide what I can and cannot do. And I just don't believe you're gonna shoot me over where I crash. If I see you touching her... I will put a bullet in whatever body part you touch her with. Understood? Yeah. WOMAN: Nathalie! What happened? The boy, Link, he attacked me. What? Here. Here. Here. Sit down. He dragged me to the tower, and he hit me. He said he would hurt me again and again until I gave in to God's will. Nathalie, where is Link? All right, it's okay. You don't have to tell me, but... The mist came. It saved me. It saved me from him. Why did he attack you? I don't know. Do you know why, Gregory? [door crashes open] MAN: Hurry up! - MAN: Is the door locked? - WOMAN: Come in. Guys, open it up for him. [clamor] WOMAN: What... What is that? They just started coming down outside. It's the State Guard. They're coming! [applause] [overlapping chatter] [chatter continues] - It's so wonderful. - [laughs] How long do you think it'll take? It could be today. Come in. [chatter stops] What's he doing here? I'll tell you later. Just help me keep an eye on him. [scoffs] Yeah. See this? Look at this. We have to get out of this place. Hey. Where the hell have you been? I, uh, tried to find gas for us. Did you have to steal the keys for that? What the hell happened here? You gonna tell me what happened? We just need to get out. - Is the car outside? - Yeah, it's... - WOMAN: The lights, the lights? - WOMAN 2: Don't panic! MIA: Let's go. Let's go. That way. - MAN: The generator's out! - MIA: Go. You need help? I'm good. [crowd clamor] [overlapping chatter, screaming] [woman sobbing] [woman screams] MAN: Where's the car? MIA: No, no, no. We won't make it. Let's go. Follow me! [clamor continues] ADRIAN: What's going on? The electric doors opened when the generator cut out. ADRIAN: Then where the hell are we going? The only place the doors will stay shut. - Where? - The psych ward. Let's go. Come on. Hey, open up! Open up! Come on! ADRIAN: What are we gonna do? - Come on! - What are we gonna do?
