 - You don't want to know. - It's okay. What if they're all dead? They're not. But what if they are? We haven't seen or heard from anyone. They're fine. She's the only friend I have. She's okay. You don't know that. I do. I do. We have to get going, all right? Out there? How? Come on. Come here. There. Look. See that? What if it doesn't have any keys? I bet Mia knows how to hot-wire. I don't trust her. Plus, she's kinda cuffed right now. Yeah, I'll talk to Connor. He'll understand. I used to bring you to this mall when you were a baby. Something about the ambient noise helped put you to sleep. When you got older, we went here with Dad. He always got you a balloon. Remember? Please talk to me. It's okay to be scared about what happened. I'm scared, too. Scared? About which thing? There are so many options. Should I be scared about the people who hung themselves or that big cloud of whatever it is outside? Or do you mean that I'm stuck in this mall with the guy who raped me? I'm working on that last part. I just... I wish you'd tell me what you're feeling. Who says I'm feeling anything? Here. It's from that fancy kitchen store. - What? - Eh, the knife. That place on the second floor where all the newlyweds go. Oh. Wait. Look. She's Army. Maybe he is, too. Why the hell is the military here? We found these when we cut them down. They were military. Maybe they went AWOL or something? So they killed themselves just when they got off the base? Either way, they can't stay here. Enough bacteria to close the food court for life. Okay, Mr. Proper. You know, that sad little game store of yours has always been the embarrassment of this place. If you don't have anything to contribute, I suggest you pretend it's just a normal day and go and be pointless on your own turf. What do we do with them? They're U.S. soldiers. If no one's opened the freezer at the supermarket, we can maybe put 'em in there. Might still be cold... for a little while. We're gonna have to search everybody for dog tags. - You. - Hey, stop that man! Get off me! Get off me! I don't know anything. Bullshit. - Why are you here? - I swear I... What's out there?! You and your friends know something. I'm a private! Officers don't tell us shit, just where to drive. Why would they kill themselves? Because they know what's happening out there. I never thanked you for helping me yesterday with the wine. Yeah, helping people drink, that's a... that's a talent of mine. What do you think it is? The other day, I was in my garden, and a moth landed on my hand, beautiful creature. I looked up, and... suddenly it was as if all of nature had come alive. Frogs came out of the soil. Salamanders came out of the lake. Birds seemed as if they were fleeing. And then a big toad came up and ate it right off my hand. I went to the library, and I found something similar happened back in 1860. The Black Spring. You know it? I guess you didn't grow up around here. It's a local bedtime story. It's what you tell kids to behave in this town. My Mom said it was a curse on the town after a young woman was murdered. Others said it's an Indian thing. It's like our... our version of Santa, but instead of not getting gifts if you don't behave, you'll be torn apart alive. So maybe this is another Black Spring? I, uh... I spent six years in jail for doing some pretty awful things, so, if that was the case, I'd be the first one gone. What were you looking at? That gray shape out there, you see it? Maybe. That's my husband. That's Benedict. Do you have two minutes? I'm stuck in a church. Fire away. I know we have our thing right now. Can we just put it aside for a second? Sure. Adrian and I are gonna go to the mall. I know Eve and Alex are there. Okay. I need you to let me take these two with me. - Why? - Because I don't know what's gonna happen out there, and the more people we are, the safer we'll be. No, I mean why would I do that? They're prisoners. No, I know, but these are extraordinary circumstances. I think we need to help each other now. I'm happy to help, but an extraordinary situation seems like a great argument to not let dangerous people run in the streets. She's not dangerous. She's just loud. This woman is wanted for murder. You didn't think about that, did you? 'Course you didn't. 'Cause you have the privilege of not being around criminals every day, so you can tell yourself that people like her are the victims and I'm the asshole. She's not gonna hurt anyone. She saved my life. I need her help. You heard him. I'm not... I'm not gonna hurt anyone. What he needs to do is respect the law, and what you need to do is to shut up. Connor, please, just let her go. I've known you my entire life. You keep thinking this is about me and you. Of course it's... Of course it's about us. No, no, no. This is about the law, and that's it. You know what? You're right. I do think you're an asshole. I think you became a Cop just 'cause you like to feel important and 'cause you like to arrest people. Like this? You got a basement? - Come on, Connor. - You, too. Connor... Come on. Come on. Connor. Oh, yeah, well, that's great. Thanks a lot. That's just great. Hey! Come on! I'm cold. Could you get my jacket? Here. Take mine. No, no, no. Then you're gonna get cold. Just... Just hand me mine. Don't worry. Don't laugh, but it's... it's like a security blanket, okay? Please? Thank you. Is this what you're looking for? Here. Hey... What do you say, you and I, we choose to trust each other? I could really use someone to trust. Okay. I don't want you staying close to Jay. We need to find another place to set up camp. Want to help? Thanks. - We'll be back. - Okay. "Go be pointless on your own turf." Yeah, right. Could a pointless person do this? Whoa. Hoo hoo! Nice. When my grandmother died, I was eight or something. I asked my Mom if I could take her to school for show and tell. What did she say? She said, "Dead bodies can't stay above ground. The air makes them sad." Yeah, actually, that's not a bad idea. What? A little show and tell? What if we put the bodies outside, use them as bait, see what shows up? You're a freaking genius. Yeah. Who's pointless now, bitch? You feeling better now? A little. I'm not very good at thank-yous. Don't worry about it. And you're not... looking for something in return? What? You're gay, as well? No. I don't think so. Well, what then? Married? Faithful to Mrs. Laconic Soldier? I don't know what I am. How Zen. No, um, no, I... I don't know. What do you mean? What do you mean? I woke up in the mountains, and, uh... I couldn't even remember my name. I remember the dog, and... I remember the mist came and killed him, but, before all that... I remember nothing. What? Guess that... guess that makes you the lucky one. Come on. Come on. It's okay. All right. It's all right. It's all right. Okay. Still want to leave? Can't stay here another day. Where are you gonna go? Talk to Mia. See if she can hot-wire a car. If she can, I'll get them out somehow. She's a murderer. Sometimes things are more complicated than that. Would you say the same about Jay? She did a bad thing. A person ready to do a bad thing is not the worst to have around at the moment. Stand guard for me, okay? I'm gonna try to talk to her. Okay. Hey. You hear me? You okay down there? Oh, it's the whiny man from the police station. I'm gonna get you out, okay? He says he's gonna get us out. Thanks. Soldier boy says thanks. Do you by any chance know how to hot-wire a car? Oh, what, just because I was in jail, - I'm also a car thief, right? - Shh, shh. What? You want to ask the black guy next? S-Sorry. Sorry. It's okay. Of course I do. Father. I'm scared. It's okay. So am I. Priests get scared, too. I don't know if you know this, but I've known your mother a very long time. She loved coming here when she was younger. We all need an escape, and this was hers. You mean from my Dad. Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally. You? Creep. God. But God doesn't love me. Of course He does. Haven't you heard? I'm a faggot. I mean, God's love is everywhere. It's about accepting it. How do I do that? Well, often the first step is baptism, to open your heart... to let the sin out. Being gay is not a sin. Isn't lying a sin, Father? You lied about my son, didn't you? No, I didn't. Then explain something to me. If you saw what happened, why didn't you do something to stop it? I tried to, but your son's friends held me back. No one held you back. Nothing happened. You just hate my son because he's everything that you're not. Hey! Leave him alone. My son could go to jail because of this kid. He's a rapist. That's where he belongs. Your daughter gets drunk and screws around, and it's my boy's fault? But, then again, that makes perfect sense, knowing your wife. Don't you dare. Like mother, like daughter. Assaulting an officer. Seems like it's becoming an epidemic. So glad you came to save us. Okay, as soon as we get them outside, get the door closed. - How long... - Shh. Just give it a minute. Maybe two. So what's the plan? We find another place to camp out. Just need to find supplies. I'll get food. You want to get blankets? There's a store a little further down. Okay. Okay. Meet you back here. I just want to talk. I need to go. My Mom thinks I'm... Just give me a few seconds, okay? Hear me out. I'm not gonna hurt you. Want to go? - Yes. - Okay. I'll let you go. Soon as you've let me talk. I didn't hurt you, and I didn't touch you that night. I need you to believe me. I don't. I liked you. I stood up for you, and I stood up for your friend. I don't know how else to prove it to you. You can't. He saw you. He saw me do what? He saw you take me upstairs. He saw me passed out. And then what? And then what? He didn't see shit, because I took you upstairs... I took off your shoes... and I put a blanket on you, and I left you there alone to sleep it off. - Let me touch your hand. - No. I want to show you that nothing happens. I'll touch it and just let it go. Let me touch you. You see? I'm not gonna hurt you. Hey, want some? No, thanks. I think I'm gonna go home. What do you mean? I'm gonna go home. I wanted to say goodbye. I liked your company. Wait. You want to... No, Nat... Nathalie, you can't. It's too dangerous out there. - We don't know that. - No, we don't, so what, you want to risk your life just to, what, sit inside your house instead alone? I'm not going to my house. I'm going home. My home is with him. What are you doing? Goodbye. But you'll die. I have no business being alive. Nathalie, please, come in. Please come back inside. It isn't safe here. I'm fine. - Leave me alone, please. - Get back in here. Please, get in. You're putting us all in danger! - I'm gonna shut the door. - Just... Please. - It's not safe out here. - Now! - It is not safe out here. - Please, I'm... I'm fine. Nathalie, it's getting thicker. Nathalie, it is getting thicker. Come inside. Please, it's not safe here. Please, you... Aah! Aah! What is that? - There's nothing there. - There's something on me. Ahh! There's something on me. There's something on my back. Get it off of me. Nathalie. There's something there. Get it off. God. Aah! What... What is it? It's beautiful. Help me. Come on. Come on. Let's get inside. Now. Now. We gotta go now. Come on! Come on, hurry up! Why did you go out there? Did you see it? Did you see it? Do you think it could get in here? What the hell was that? - Did you see it? - Yes, yes. Yes, I saw it, but why did you go out there? Because I wanted to die. - Mrs. Raven, please... - It's okay. I don't want to die anymore. I'm happy. I've seen God. Mrs. Raven, you are in shock. Please. That wasn't God. Oh, I'm not talking about your God. What's that? I told you to get blankets, not toys. Jay was there. Did he... I'm okay. What did he say to you? That he wasn't going to hurt me. You won't have to worry about Jay much longer. So does this mean there's nothing out there? Maybe it's 'cause the bodies are cold? What the hell? Did you put them out there? What are you, crazy, man? - You. - It's too dangerous. Those are my friends. Hey! Hey! - What's going on? - They put my friends outside! They're dead. We just want to see what's going on out there. They were American soldiers! - Hey, hey, hey! - Stop it! - Stop it! - Now, stop it! We can't fight each other. This whole place is gonna explode. Then get my friends in. We were just trying to help. We can't bring 'em in now. I'm sorry. And, you two, for the last time, stop acting like kids. I think we need to establish a set of rules. We'll be safe here. Sorry. I'm trying to understand what God is telling us. What have you found? I believe this is a chance. I believe He is asking us to believe in Him. Then why wouldn't He send us something good? Do you know the story of Job? Job was a devout man... so devout that Satan challenged God. "Job only loves you for selfish reasons," he said. "If you take him through misery, he'll lose his faith." God accepted the challenge and took everything away from Job, let him live in despair, in pain. In hell. But even there, in living hell, Job never doubted God's existence, and Satan lost his bet... as you do when you gamble with God. Were you serious, what you were telling me about God loving me? I believe this is God begging you to accept His love. I think... I'd like to be baptized. I don't think I need to remind people what happened during Hurricane Katrina. I will not let this place sink into chaos. Now, sooner or later, someone will come and save us. Until then, let's make sure that we all stay together peacefully and all of us follow the same set of rules, okay? What are the rules, and who gets to decide? Well, anybody can suggest rules. Then we vote on 'em. If the majority is for, then it's decided. Okay? You want to write 'em down? We ration food, share it equally. Good. Good. Write that down. Who else? Anybody? No looting from stores, apart from food. No stealing from each other. We have to work as a group. That's another good one. Who's got a rule? Who else? Whoever endangers the group is thrown out of the mall. That would be murder. No, that would be self-defense. What's going on? They're coming up with a set of rules. No way I'm following what he comes up with. If you guys are leaving, I'd like to join you. Why? I don't think this is gonna end well, not for someone like me. You can help us pack. Can we go, too? Is that okay? Of course. Well, wait a minute. - What's going on? - We're moving. Guys, no, we need to stay together here. Well, why the hell do we have rules, if they don't apply to everybody? Come on. Look, this is for everyone's safety. Everyone? Why are you so paranoid? Alex, tell her I haven't done anything. - Don't you dare. - Calm down. - Leave her alone! - Calm down. Tell her I didn't hurt you. - I, uh... - Stay with us. It's democracy. I always was an anarchist. Eve, this is all in an effort to keep the peace. Okay. Okay. Do whatever you want. Just don't come running for help when it all falls apart, okay? Repent, and let yourself be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Go therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father... and of the Son... and of the Holy Spirit. You okay? Thank you for this. Repeat after me. "I repent and baptize myself in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." I repent and baptize myself in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. Again. - I repent... - Good. Again. - I repent... - Will you be baptized? Yes. Will you... be baptized? Yes, I will. Why? Why? Because I repent. Why? For my sins. Let them go, son. I repent. I am a sinner. I'm a sinner. I'm a sinner! - Good. - I am a sinner. I am a sinner! I am a sinner! Good, Adrian. I'm happy for you, son. This is a happy moment. God loves you. God loves you. Thank you. You guys ready to go? Listen, there's a chance... Gray SUV, around the corner to the left. Oh! I just put in fresh batteries. Thank you. You okay? Mm-hmm. Okay. I thought we talked about this. Can I help? Great idea. What made you think of this? I miss my Dad. - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - ... www.Addic7ed.com ...
