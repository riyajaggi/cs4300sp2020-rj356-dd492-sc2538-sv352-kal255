 Your true purpose beckons you. But you hesitate. - Why? - Because I'm weak. - Why are you weak? - Because I'm impure. - How do you purge yourself? - Through prayer. Kneel. Pray that your heart will be cleansed of all doubt. Your mind made certain of your mission. For these are the moments around which history pivots.

 Sanctify me in your holy name. Purify me in your holy fire. Strengthen me in your holy breath. Good. Now strip him. Help! Someone help! - Quickly. - Oh... Oh, my God. What the fuck? She was on about that bloke as was took away last night. And you, what? You helped her tie the fucking noose? I didn't think she'd do anything like this. Eh? Well, this is a right cock-up. - That it is, sir... - Oh, sh...

 Go on, Vig! - Get her! Get her! - Let me go! Come on. Philo! Philo is fucking dead, you twat. What are you waiting for? I want to look you in the eyes. What do you think you're gonna see? A darkness. An emptiness. Some sign of your true nature. My true nature? I've got very good at hiding my true nature thanks to you, you fuck. No sign of remorse whatsoever. Remorse? For what? Don't you dare. You tore her apart. Gutted her like a fish! Your own mother! You think I killed Aisling Quarelle? Say her name again. Go on. I dare you. Say it. She didn't deserve to die like that. In such a terrible way. No. She didn't. Put the gun down. Beg. Beg me for your life. Go on. The way she begged you for hers. Beg! It wasn't me she was begging. Put the gun down. Oh, fuck this. - Piece of ancient shit... - I wouldn't do that. I didn't kill my mother. I didn't even know who she was. The first time I saw her, she was lying in a pool of her own blood, murdered. By you, I thought, till now. She left me at a foundling home. I grew up with nothing but questions. And I'm never gonna be able to ask them of her now, am I? But I can ask you. Me? You, Father. I was a college student when I first saw her at some late night salon on the Row. Her performance made an impression on me, and I was just drunk enough to say so. Much to the amusement of some elites who had been flirting with her. Here was some farm boy from the Hinterlands fawning over the queen of the Row. But she didn't permit me the embarrassment. She sent them away. She was something of a pastoral girl herself, homesick for the mountains of Anoun. When winter came, I brought her here. To my family's summer house. They were the strangest and most uncomplicated days of my life. I thought they'd never end. But then my father discovered our secret. So it wasn't you she was afraid of. - It was him. - My father wasn't a conventionally powerful man, but he was brutal, with brutal friends. He threatened to kill her unless I called it off. That was the last time you saw her? She asked to see me one more time. I... never showed up. Just left her there in the club where we first met. I never knew what it was she needed to tell me, until now. It's clear to me it was about you. I was a coward. My father was right. I never would've gotten where I am had I stayed with her, but... something inside me died that day. I wouldn't be surprised if you despise me. I want to hate you, but it's a familiar story. Too familiar, maybe. Mine starts in Tirnanoc. I trust your guest found her way home this morning, sir? She did. And do you imagine you'll be seeing her again? I fail to see what concern it is of yours. Quiet right, sir. No, no. Tell me, Fergus. I beg your pardon, sir? Do you disapprove of my behavior? Does the thought of it repulse you? You answer me, Fergus! What concern is that of yours? Sir, surely you know if anyone were to find out... And how exactly would they find out, Fergus? Are you saying I can no longer rely on your discretion? I'm only saying this affair is not as well-hidden as you imagine. - People are already talking. - Talking. - That's all they do, isn't it? - It's not all they can do, sir. It's dangerous, what you're doing. I'm well-acquainted with danger, Fergus. Is she? - Good morning, dear. - Good morning. - Are you going somewhere? - Something's come up. I-I tried to tell you last night. - I knocked on your door at half past seven. - Oh. I must've fallen asleep. Are you coming down with something, dear? It must've been the book I was reading. Uh... Where are you going? The Swan is ready. - Swan? - Where's my tobacco? This new ship of yours? We take its maiden voyage today. We'll head up the coast to Port Hoy and then come directly back. Is Mr. Agreus to accompany you? Wouldn't that be a lark, dear? We should invite him to dinner when you come back. Hmm? Another scheme? No. To celebrate, as friends. Friends? Well, business partners, at least. Come now, Imogen. - What? - Parties, private dinners, auctions? I'm quite sure I don't know what you're insinuating. It's just that people would start to make unflattering assumptions if you continue on this course. Who gives a damn what people think? Imogen! It's just exhausting, constantly worrying about what people might think. It's no way to live, Ezra. You speak as though this, uh, creature has truly become a friend to you? - No, of course not. - So? Well, what is he, then? A neighbor. - Yes? - An acquaintance. A Puck. I'll see that she's released, but... you can't return to the city. You understand that? The killer's still out there. Which you are in no position to investigate. From what you've told me, you're the next target. I can't just stand by. As far as anyone knows, you were taken to be executed. Stay dead. You'll live longer. I'll see this ugliness settled. Turn your eye to the chances you have left with that girl of yours. Before it's too late. Trust me on this. Vignette...? - Stonemoss. - Vignette Stonemoss. I'll take care of it. I wish I knew you better. Godspeed, my boy. Was it that Longerbane girl? Did you really think your driver would keep that secret? Fine. Yes. I was with Sophie. Sophie Longerbane. Well, I'd advise you to stay away from her. I would think you'd be relieved I wasn't on the Row. That girl... is twice as dangerous as anything on the Row. You don't know that family like I do. I knew her father before you were even born. And he was a snake. - He's never wronged me. - How can you even say that after he kidnapped you? Do you take me for a fucking fool? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry! It was for your own good. -It's always been for your own good. -As if you have - any idea what my own good was. - You don't see the big picture - from where you're standing. - Then show it to me. Jonah, y-you have to trust me. No, if you have some reason for me to reconsider my choices, you can explain it to me like an adult. She's leader of the opposition. - I'll see whom I please. - No, not her. Why the fuck not? - Because... - Oh, because, because what? - Because she's smarter than you? Hmm? - No, not her. - Because she's more beautiful? - Because... Not her, not her... Because she's younger than you? Because she's your sister. Shut that bloody dog up. I know who you are. Fight the false imprisonment of fae. Thank you very much. Help out Vignette. Come on, ladies. - Moira? - Take it. Thank you. I'll-I'll pay you back. Don't worry about it. We look after our own, eh? Hello, Patrick. Thank you, you're a gentleman. What do you want, Philo? I'm just here for Vignette. Well, as far as I'm aware, her current address is a holding cell under constabulary number six. At least until this fucking - bribe is paid. - You don't have to worry about that. She's being released. What d'you mean, she's being released? I wish to see the Magister of Police at once. What may I say of the reason? You may say it is urgent. Pour me a cup of tea, will you? Um... Krik. A new world is upon us, Krik. Change is coming to this city. Ah. It starts now, with the one thing my father could not give me. Freedom. Vignette... Stonemoss. Your tea. You're not Krik. Death to the tyrant! The Hidden One is revealed. - Death to the tyrant! - Oi! He has revealed! Death to the tyrant! He has revealed! He's-he's still breathing. He's alive. You're growing rather bold, showing up at my house like this, in broad daylight no less. I won't be long. Come now, don't be so pessimistic. We can't, Sophie. We can't what? We can't keep doing this. Ah. I see what this is. Your mother told you, did she? Told me what? About her affair with my father. - You knew? - Calm down, Jonah. - You knew we were... - I knew it was a possibility. What, and-and the possibility alone didn't... Didn't what? Oh, I don't know, give you some pause? Why should it? I grew up alone, locked up in this place. No friends, no siblings, no family, apart from a distant, bitter father. And then a stranger comes into my life, with whom I feel some shred of a connection. Why should that give me any pause at all? Because the world out there has boundaries. Well, since when have you ever cared about that world's boundaries? We don't belong to that world. It belongs to us. We are descended from emperors and pharaohs. You really think this is the first time this has happened in our family tree? This is how power was born. You could be a force to be reckoned with. - What's this? - An offer. Something to consider. Come in. What is it, Jenila? A messenger from Balefire. Master Jonah is to return at once. Where is that Critch traitor? He's being interrogated at the Keep. We're questioning all the Critch servants, and we'll be replacing them, of course. How is he? - He's stable for now. - I need to see him. No. He's-he's weak. He needs to rest. Jonah, don't... Don't upset him. Jonah. They say I'm likely to survive. That was a close call. Indeed. Tell me... did it cross your mind how ill-equipped I was to assume your responsibilities if you hadn't. Hadn't what? Survived. But I'm likely to. They-they say that I'm likely... I keep thinking how... odd it is that you never remedied that, with so much at stake. That you'd always let me get away with anything. If I was too soft, it's because I have such love for you. But no ambitions, no plans. It's as if you never saw me as a true successor. That's preposterous. You carry my very name. Your name and little else. Where is this coming from? Mother told me the truth. Jonah. I don't know what you're talking about. You expect me to believe that? As much as you... hated Ritter Longerbane? You knew something. You've at least suspected. - Suspected? - Really? In-in-in quiet moments, in the dead of night, you never scrutinized my sleeping face and wondered... Wondered if you were really my son. There it is. There it is. Early on. Longerbane was a rival for her affections, after all. But, Jonah, you are my boy. My boy. And I'm proud that you have my name. Couldn't give a fuck about your name... or her ridiculous prophecy, frankly. Jonah, where are you going? Jonah, come back. - Jonah. - Goodbye, Chancellor. Jonah! Why? So... you're Breakspear's bastard son? So it would seem. And Vini knew your secret, that you were a-a half-blood all this time? Since Tirnanoc. That explains so much. Just, um... just take care of her. Please. I will. Not that she needs me the way I need her. Oh, she does. Open that drawer. Go on. She brought it all the way from Anoun. It was all she brought. I told her to burn it and have done with you, but she wouldn't. - Should've known then, really. - Known what? That she still loved you, you idiot. Oh, hello. This is the servants' entrance, Miss Imogen. Yes, I'm aware of the irony. Very amusing. Well, aren't you going to invite me in? What are you doing here? I thought we might... You thought we might... what? Well... you know. I'm sure I don't. You're being very difficult. Well, you came to my house. I'm merely asking why. Don't you think we have some... matters to discuss? It's early. Won't your brother be wondering where you are? He's left town for the night. What? You shouldn't be here. You can't just expect me to pretend it never happened. That's exactly what I expect. And you? Can you forget so easily? Don't flatter yourself. I beg your pardon. It would be improper for me to say more. Well, don't hold back on my account. We're both adults. Very well. You want the truth? I think I deserve it. The truth, Miss Imogen, is that you are a callow and graceless lover, and yesterday was utterly forgettable. You're lying. What do you know? I know enough. I know there are things a man can't fake. What do you want me to say? That it obsesses me? The smell of your hair, the feel of your skin against mine. That I haven't stopped thinking about it all day? But you wish to, is that it? There are some pursuits even I can't afford. Then why even bother with this whole ridiculous charade? Charade? The house. The clothes. The art. What is the point in pretending to be one of us if there is any part of this life you cannot have? Oh, yes, that's it, isn't it? That's how your kind goes through life, isn't it? Perfectly entitled. Thinking everyone wants to be you, and the whole bloody world belongs to you. Well, if you mean we don't apologize for our ambitions, then you're right. When we want something, we take it. And what is it that you want? You know good and well what I want. Get dressed. - Ezra. - Go home and wait for me. This is between myself and Mr. Agreus. Get out of the bed. Out. Ezra... Ezra, please. Get away! You, turn and face the wall. Turn around and face the wall, you animal. You whore! You whore. How dare you consort with a fucking animal! You'll destroy us! Now you've done it. All of this, everything you have is going to go. You're dead, Puck. You're as good as dead. - Imogen, what are you doing? - Agreus, we have to go. - We have to leave now. - But this is my house. I know, but the police will not see it that way. They will come and they will see a Puck standing over a bleeding man. Please. Are you insane? Where-where will you go? I-Imogen, you-you can't leave. Im-Imogen! Open the door. Open the door! Wherever you will go, I-I will find you both! I will find you! Something's not right. Well, surely he wouldn't have forgotten, would he? Moira! She's dead. Who? The Haruspex. The Haruspex? Fleury, did you say the Haruspex? What do you mean? Coming through. Was it the Darkasher? Why her? She knew something. Or she saw something. It didn't take her liver, though. Inspector... I've been waiting for you. The press have got wind of the incident. They're starting to ask questions. Anything else? You were holding this when you were attacked. Thank you. Has the magister of police arrived yet? He's still on his way. Damn it. Hurry him up. You sent for me? I did. Darling... is there anything I can get for you? - No. - I hate to see you like this. Some water. I just wanted to tell you that I spoke to Jonah earlier. Oh? How did that go? He may have inadvertently helped me solve a little riddle that I've been mulling over lately. Oh. What sort of riddle? Is she still alive? I am... suspended in the gloaming, between day and night... between the breath and the silence, with the warp and weft of creation unfurled before me. I can see it all so clearly now. Every thread. Every intersection. What if my dear wife always harbored some private reason to doubt that her boy was my son? You're delirious. But it was my son who was augured for greatness. And I had no other. Until, by some means known only to her, she discovered a secret. I'm getting the doctor. A secret that even I didn't know. There was, somewhere in the world, another son. Who did this? Should have seen it sooner. It was right in front of me all along. The interest she took in my work. Now she had a problem. She had no way of knowing if the future promised to her child, the future she'd gambled everything on, belonged, in fact, to another. But she knew at least that it couldn't belong to a dead man. She was always such a curious girl. Too curious. Who? Who was? The chancellor's wife. Where is he? I've met him, Piety. Where? He can never amount to anything. Not here. He's a half-blood. - He's no threat to our... - Where is he? Jonah is the one. He is my son. The future you've been promised belongs to him. Only him. -I can't take that chance. Tell me where he is. -Piety, Piety, no one need know any of this. But this must stop now. No. Tell me. God's noose, Piety! It's just a circus trick! Pay any pig charlatan 50 stivers and they'll tell you anything you want to hear! - Tell me, tell me. - It's not real. - You have to tell me. - It's not real! It never was, Piety! Tell me. Tell me. Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! You will, one way or another. I sense her, even now. Her rage... is a bruise on time itself. Makes her strong, makes her... powerful. Her dark work is not yet done. Not yet. More blood has been shed. Your father's blood. His secrets are hers now. Like father, like son. She knows your weakness. A girl. A Pix. The one you love is in grave danger. "Vignette Stonemoss." You've got friends in high places, don't you? They even sent a coach to pick you up. She's hers now. Time is running out. Go. Go, go. How are you going to get into Balefire? Same way that thing gets out. Right, then. I'll find her. I'll see you soon. It's something to consider. Lady Piety was the last person to see him alive. - Where is she? - No one has seen her since. - Find her. - Magister, you can't seriously think she had something to do with this? He was alive when she was in the room. Now he's dead, and she's gone. Clearly the Puck attacker had coconspirators... Find her! Yes, Chancellor. "Chancellor..." It's true. Until the next election, you are acting chancellor. I'm not a violent person. I don't want to do this. But I will if you force me to. You don't want to do what, exactly? Just tell me where your friend is, and you'll never have to know. It's you? - You made the Darkasher? - Shut up. I'm the one asking the questions. Where is he? What do you want with him? Fuck. Are you not hearing me at all? Do you understand what's at stake here? Do you have any idea what I've done? I-I, I don't know where he is. Would you tell me if you did? Mm, no. I didn't think so. And I gave you every chance in the world to save yourself. You should have just told me. I think we're in luck. He's coming for you. All right. I should have known you'd come for her. - What have you done with her? - She's fine. It's not about her. It was never about any of them. It was only about you. It's always been about you. You know, the irony is that I would never have even known you existed if not for your mother's blackmail note. Blackmail note? The lengths a mother goes to, eh? I can't take any chances. Not after all I sacrificed. I've come too far to turn back now. The time has come to finish this. It's finished. Oh, but it's not. He wasn't alone. There are others. The Puck will give us names. It's only a matter of time. I want emergency measures in place today. Am I perfectly clear? Now, unless there is anything else, I have a parliamentary address to prepare for. Oh, Mr. Millworthy, there you are. You sent for me, sir? - I did indeed. - I'm so sorry for your loss. It's a horrid ordeal. Has your mother been located yet? No. No, she remains unaccounted for. - Ah. - Uh, but th-this was found among her personal effects. What is it? A faerie was found dead on the Row last week. A singer of some repute in her day. Aisling. Yes. I'm to understand you moved in the same circles. It was a long time ago. But you did know her? Forgive me, sir, but why did you call me here, if I may ask? Read it. Out loud, please. "Dearest Lady Piety, "forgive me for involving you in this sad business, "but you will understand in a moment why one such as I "might not trust your husband to do right. "The truth is, I have fallen on hard times since last I saw him. "But with election season nearing, "I am sure the papers would pay very good money to hear the story of the half-blood son..." "the story of the half-blood son I bore by the chancellor." - Sir, I think that... - It would appear this letter was written by your faerie friend. What do you think about that? No. It's not her style. - Are you quite sure? - Yes. She was my dear friend. That's not her voice. That's not her way. No, I am certain. Aisling would never write such a letter. I was afraid you'd say that. I've decided that I'm no longer in need of an arts and letters tutor. I understand, sir. But I am in need of an honest man. Sir? Special advisor to the chancellor. Thank you. You are a steadying influence, Mr. Millworthy. I will need that. In the hard days to come. Sorry. What hard days to come? It turns out that this Puck assassin was a member of a larger radical organization. What? What do you mean? And what does that mean for the city and the Row and all the innocent fae? It means that things are going to get worse before they get better. Where is it you're going? Port Hoy. Then to New Freehold. Somewhere a pair like us won't raise eyebrows. Well, I wish you luck. You're not cross with me, are you? Why would I be cross with you? I don't know. Oh. Look, Vini... um... I'm your friend above all. Always your friend. I-I just want you to be happy. That's all I want. So go on. Be happy. You, too. I love you. Oh, I love you, too. Oh, piss off. Go on. Come here, you dirty Critch. Those are the orders. Back to the Row. Okay, move along, thank you. Pardon me. Thank you. Uh, you can't be here. You have to go back to the Row. Back to the Row? Why? You don't understand. We're just trying to leave. No Critch are getting in or out of the city - until further notice. - Why? What's going on? The chancellor's been assassinated by Puck cultists. All Critch are to be sequestered to the Row. No exceptions. We're being signaled back into port, sir. All vessels are to return. Ignore them. Let them chase us if they'd like. What course shall we set? The captain would like to know where to take us. Somewhere new. Somewhere far away. Surprise us. Ma'am. Sir. "I'm sure the papers would pay very good money "to hear the story of the half-blood son I bore by the chancellor." Colors suit you. Looking over your speech? Actually I was just considering your offer. Of marriage. Marriage? You make it sound so small and ordinary. - And what were you thinking? - A dynasty. What were you thinking? I was thinking it looks rather like this blackmail note that was sent to my mother. Aren't you the clever one? It's true. You're responsible for everything. I confess I wasn't expecting you to work that out so soon. Still, it's exciting to know I can still be surprised. How did you know...? The secret was so... buried. Nothing is ever truly buried from those who look. My father had been collecting dirt on the chancellor for quite some time. He was bound to chance upon the rumors. Devastating if true. But he refused to make use of them beyond the occasional jab or insinuation on the floor of Parliament. Some residual feelings for your mother, I expect. I, of course, had no such compunction. No such compunction? My father's fucking dead because of this letter! And yet your eyes are perfectly clear. Why is that? Tell me, have you wept at all? I could have you put in irons. You could... but you won't. Give me one reason not to. You're about to march out there and announce that the most powerful city in the world has a new leader. Because of that letter. Isn't it curious that the stroke of a girl's pen can change the course of history? Why did you do this? Because chaos creates opportunity. For what? For us. They are ready for you, sir. You are chancellor now. The real game is about to begin. It's time for you to decide. Are we to be friends? Or are we to be enemies? Ladies and gentlemen of Parliament... the Leader of the Opposition and the Chancellor. My friends... I come to you at this moment of great loss with an urgent message. We are a city under siege. From threats the likes of which my father could not have fathomed. Threats from without... and within. We stand at the precipice of a great and secret war. It is not a war we asked for. But by God, it is a war we will win! Even now, measures are being taken to protect the people of this great city. We will prevail. We will steel ourselves against those who plot our destruction. We will meet their eyes and not blink. We will not compromise. We will not negotiate. Come on, move along. See, now, I believe you've made a mistake. I was born here. No exceptions, come on. Keep moving. We will hunt them... to the very edge of the world. We do not know what the future holds. But we know this. Petty politics have divided this chamber for far too long. Divided we are weak. We cannot be weak. Not today. Today we have a common enemy. And we must stand as one if we are to prevail. I ask you now... honorable leader of the opposition. Will you stand with me? I will. We will! Fuck this, I'm leaving. Fleury. Vignette! Vignette! There you go, darling. You're all right, mate. You're all right. Just Critch, mate, move along. Philo! Philo, I beg you, don't make trouble. I'll find a way out. We've got a flier! - Let me go! - Fleury, they'll shoot you out of the fucking sky! No! Oh, God. I'll find a way. I told you, mate. It's just Critch. Move on. I am Critch. Thank you, Chancellor. A new day is dawning. A change is coming to this city. Together, we have crossed a line in the sand. And we can never go back.
