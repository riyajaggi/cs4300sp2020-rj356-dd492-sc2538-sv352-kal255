 [cell phone ringing] [automated voice] You have ten new messages. Received today at 8:40 p.m. [woman] I'm calling on behalf of the Financial Newspaper. Can you call me back? We would like to hear your reaction to the accusations against Cees de Wolf. CITY COUNCIL USES TAX MONEY ON PROSTITUTES [cell phone ringing] -Mr. Blaauw? -[Blaauw] Was it you? Did they get this from you? No, of course not.

 I am expecting you in my office. [opening theme song playing] A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES WOMEN OF THE NIGHT -How was I supposed to know? -[Xandra] You don't need to know anything. Don't do anything if I don't ask you to. You weren't there. I couldn't get ahold of you. Marieke said you quit. Marieke is doing great. Those girls love her. She won't let herself be put aside, princess. No? She won't get a successful business handed to her, either. [in English] All right. That's a very good idea. Okay. Bye.

 -Hi. -Hi. [in Dutch] Do you have the phone? -From Bliss? From the vault? -Yes. I need it. I don't have the girls' numbers. How professional. [chuckles] What did you expect? That we would be waiting for you? Come on, dear. You completely abandoned us. I'm sorry. Marieke... I have a contact who can help us. Who can really help Bliss further. Someone who will lead us to the top of the international business world, but I will need the numbers. The girls don't want to work for you. Send your contact to me. [laptop chimes] Do you have any idea what kind of world this is? -I've been in it long enough. -As an escort. Maybe one of the best. But pleasuring a man is very different from dealing with the thugs in this business. -Do you have any idea how to do that? -Yes. Become best friends, right? Will you please give me those phone numbers, now? [Xandra sighs] We will do this together. And that is that. [sighs] Yes. Okay. -We will do this together. -Good. I will make sure something gets put on paper. After you have signed it, you will get the phone. Okay. Great. [Blaauw] People always smell shit, even when there's none. I have a pack of wolves in front of my house. I have no idea who passed this. "I have no idea..." Cut the crap. Everyone's reputation is on the line. Even the coffee lady is seen as a whore. Am I the only one who knows what De Wolf is up to? This cannot spread further. What does he say? -[knock on door] -Yes. What? We're in the middle of a conversation. Cees de Wolf is dead. Suicide. That is the assumption. He slit his wrists. Find out how his private life got out. Talk to the press. And whatever happens, you will protect me. -[reporters talking indistinctly] -[camera shutters clicking] -Good afternoon. Thank you for coming. -[reporter 1] Will the mayor resign? -[reporter 2] Does he take responsibility? -I will answer questions later. I regret to inform you that Cees de Wolf passed away this morning. What happened? -[reporter 3] Where was he found? -[reporter 4] When was he found? [reporter 5] Is the cause of death known? The investigation into his death has only just begun. However, everything points to suicide. As you will understand, -that is all I can say about this case. -[reporter 6] Doesn't his death -prove he was part of the criminal world? -Thanks. It's still too early for conclusions. -There you go. Bye. -[Michiel] No stone will be left unturned. [reporter 6] Undoubtedly, but will we see who's underneath? -[reporter 7] Was there an investigation? -[reporter 8] De Wolf was infamous?  [reporter 9] How did the mayor react? Mayor Blaauw is deeply affected by the sudden death of Mr. De Wolf. They have worked closely together for years. The mayor supports the city council completely. I assure you that the fight against organized crime will continue, despite this incident. [reporter 10] Wouldn't it be better to sort out the city council first? [reporter 11] Hasn't the upper world become the underworld? [Michiel] As I said, there will be a full investigation based on the reports. -[scoffs] -[reporter 12] Last question. Did you know that Cees de Wolf was visiting prostitutes? What people do in their private life is up to them. But wasn't prostitution in Amsterdam part of his research? Not every prostitute is part of a criminal network. -Thank you for you time. -[reporter 12] But... If I didn't know you, I would think you would choose this. Isn't it pretty? It's from Brazil. Do you really think people believe it was suicide? Since I do know you, I think you would choose this. Pretty but rugged. [in English] Fuck off! [in Dutch] Is this how you thank me? You wanted to get rid of him. You're sick. No, I'm feeling great. -But you're a bit pale. -Where do you get the nerve? Do you want to know what you got yourself into? What I... [stutters] I don't have blood on my hands. Are you serious? Do you know how easy it is to link you to De Wolf's death? [footsteps receding] Did you get my contract? Certainly. My lawyer has it. Okay. Daisy and Bibi are participating as well. -Only Anne is playing hard to get. -I'll persuade her. Really? How? Without the phone. Marieke... Let's cut it out. [sighs] Give me that phone. It will be fine. [telephone ringing] Yes? -Hey. -Hey. Have you seen the news? Thanks to your mother, I'm involved. I thought you were exaggerating. I thought, "Who would kidnap her own granddaughter?" Shall we deal with this together? You want to deal with my mother together? Yes. And I want you. I miss you. And the little one. Do you know where Lu is? [sighs] I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. [footsteps receding] [Lulu] I didn't know where to go. That one is nice. I'm experimenting a little. I'm searching for a combination of stylish but provocative. [camera shutter clicks] Do you want sugar? Uh, no, thanks. This isn't something you would wear to work, is it? [chuckles] Unless you're a hooker. [laughing] Did you run away? Mmm... Can you call it that if you're unwanted? Here. Thank you. I actually wanted to go to Rachid, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Why? He doesn't answer the phone. What a jerk. Yeah. No? [Lulu sighs] I don't know. I can't keep running after him either, right? Maybe. But maybe not. I have to admit that I'm confused, too. I've quit. I'm not a hooker anymore. For him? For myself. I guess Jeroen and I weren't meant for each other. [chuckles softly] When do you know you are? Hmm? [cell phone chimes] Your mother is coming. -You have my permission to stay. -No. Lulu, wait. Here, go to my house. 156 Van der Hoopstraat. Stay as long as you want. Okay. -Yes? -Sure. Don't tell Xandra. Sure. -Do you want coffee? -No. I want you. I've quit. You're going to focus on designing. Yes. Anne. Would you have come up with this without Bliss? This is so much better than the ready-to-wear stuff you did. This is what women want to try. Secretly. Maybe. Look at you standing there like a scared little bird. You're even too scared to ask me to leave. You know why? Because you want me to persuade you. Because you really enjoyed your job. Secretly. [sighs] [Anne] Uh... ...De Wolf's death. Mr. Mayor. Yes. [door closes] How well do you know your spin doctor? Michiel? Uh... Michiel Pressman is a capable communication strategist. Maybe a bit too ambitious, but in a good way. Why? I strongly suspect that Pressman released information on De Wolf knowingly. What do you mean? How long has he been working here? What do you have on Pressman? Nothing concrete. For now. -But I have a feeling-- -I'm sorry. My position doesn't allow me to listen to gut feelings. With all due respect, gut feelings are the only thing I have left. It is very unlikely that Cees de Wolf acted alone. If the reports are true, he played a double role for years. Someone must have noticed. Perhaps someone who didn't want this to get out. Someone here in the city hall, someone high up. Someone who was likely being pressured by Cees himself. But nothing concrete. [sighs] -So, this is a probability theory? -If you want to call it that. I want to investigate this further, but I will need your cooperation. I understand it's your job. Broad search. But it is my job to keep the peace. Instead of letting this suicide grow into an administrative riot, based on a probability. Are you saying I should drop the investigation? No need to drop anything. Just don't start. In case of the slightest suspicion that an investigation is needed, I will contact you. Thank you for your cooperation. [pop music playing over headphones] [knocking at door] [Xandra] Lu. Hey, Lu. How did you know I was here? Mmm. Can you sit down? [sighs] What is your plan? I don't know. Are you going to school? No. [sighs] No, I don't think so. Don't make the same mistakes I did. [laughing] I thought you never make mistakes. No, I... I will never become like you. You are impossible to live with, Xan. So, what are you doing here? So, you want to do it alone? Okay. Then do that. [breathes deeply] Do you promise to call me if you need help? If it doesn't work out? [cell phone chiming] -[in English] Hi. -[Marina] Xandra, how are you? I'm fine. I called earlier. Marieke answered. She said she's your partner. -Can I help you? -Yes. Can you send me photos, please, of the escorts that you will bring? Yes, sure. Who's the other agency? I assume you need more than four girls. Right? I am arranging the others. Excellent quality. But new blood is always appreciated. Okay. Bye. [cell phone chimes] Yeah. Michiel. Blaauw wanted me to talk to you. Now that Wolf is gone, you will be the interim leader of the cleanup team. What? Did you think we would give up the task force? -No, but-- -Interim, Michiel, so it's temporary. [gunshots continue] Bear. Come here. Was that necessary? [device beeps] [cell phone chiming] Answer. Answer the phone. [cell phone continues chiming] [man] Pooh Bear, please help me! Help me! No! No! I'll do anything you want. No, it's too late. Please. [man crying] You should've thought of that before you touched my brother. [man choking] [whimpers] No. [continues whimpering] Um... Although the reason is sad, I am happy to announce to you that Michiel Pressman will take over Cees de Wolf's tasks. The last couple of months, Michiel has proven to be honorable and strategic. And we could use his network with the press right now. [chuckles] -I give you the floor. -Yes. Thank you for your trust. Uh... There are some big raids scheduled for next week. [opera music playing] Can you check? I think it's crooked. It is. -You're good. -There they are. [whispers] [Marina] Xandra. [in English] This is Marieke. She's one of my most successful escorts. And this is Marina Carmin. -Enchantée, Madame Carmin. -Enchantée. Who are they? The older one of the two is Mattei. This is his party. Mattei is one of Europe's most powerful arms dealers. And he's a kingmaker. His guests tonight include ministers and top diplomats. And the other one? Charles. The lobbyist. He works more or less exclusively for Mattei. Mattei is a man with complex tastes. [Ralph in Dutch] That's how fast it can happen. One moment you have everything and the next you have nothing. No company. No stuff. No sweetheart. No little brother. [laughing] I fucked him in the ass. Mmm. Come on, then. [groans and laughs maniacally] [gasping] [continues choking] [in English] Your Minister of Defence. Willem Van Dijk. Tonight is all about him. Everyone, you probably have very important topics to share and discuss with one another, but do not forget that we also thought of other fine things for you. Like tonight, for instance, this exquisite intermezzo. [in Dutch] I don't think so. For real? Next level, darlings. -Is this a beauty pageant? -Let's go. -Wow. -Go! [whispers] No way I'm going with him. [whispering indistinctly] [man] Ralph. Check this. [whispering indistinctly] They're from Poland. They're Willem's. [Ralph] Not anymore. [in English] You come with me. [man speaking indistinctly on PA] Fuck. [clicks tongue] [speaking indistinctly] [men continue speaking indistinctly] -Whoa. -Whoa! -Hey, girl. -Hi. Hey. Lost? Adrift, strayed, disoriented? Do you know him? Let me see. No. Maybe one of my friends knows him. She's looking for him. -[man 1 whistling] -[man 2 clicking tongue] Why are you looking for him? -Uh... -Hmm? I need him. What are you doing here? Huh? You can't speak anymore? Lost your tongue? -[man speaking Arabic] -Huh? -I-- -"I" what? [men speaking Arabic] [man in Dutch] She's dangerous. Ismael. [men speaking Arabic] Stupid slut. [men speaking Arabic] [line rings] [in German] I have something special for you. Come. Please. Please come, Mr. Minister. [drink pouring] Here you go. Thank you. [grunts] Surprise us! Hmm. Okay. -Okay. -Excellent. Excellent. Everyone... We have a special reason to celebrate. Cheers! -Cheers. -Cheers! [all clapping] [clattering] [motorbike approaching] [in Dutch] Hey, girl. Please wait. Why are you running? What do you want? I got this for you. What's wrong? Relax. Everything okay? -[panting] -Are you going to him? -Are you going to him? -Who? Rachid. [Lulu] Thanks. What are you doing here? I was just looking for you. Leave me alone. Uh... If you want me to leave you alone... Hmm? Maybe you should answer the phone when I call and tell me what the fuck is going on. Why do you think I'm not answering? I don't know. What's wrong? -Rachid. -Don't call me anymore. Don't follow me. I don't want to see you anymore. [door opens and closes] Rachid. Hey. Leave me alone. [slow music playing] [in English] Are you having a good time? [Xandra] Mmm-hmm. It's going fine. Everyone is happy. Satisfied. Relax. We got everything under control. Now, we can also enjoy ourselves. [in Dutch] Congratulations on your promotion. You could look a little happier. I am very happy for you. And for myself, of course. Can you send me the schedule tomorrow? Thank you. [gasping] [continues gasping] [line ringing] [vibrating] [Xandra gasping] [Xandra over voicemail] This is the voicemail of Xandra Keizer. Leave a message after the beep. Mom. Can you please call me back? Mom. Please. [breath trembling] [closing theme song playing] Subtitle translation by Shejla Hrustanovic
