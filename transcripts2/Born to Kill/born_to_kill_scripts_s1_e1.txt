 Cos smiling is attractive. OK? Smiling, you know, it draws people in. You know, it's more likely to draw people in than to push them away, you know? Have you ever wondered, kids smile 400 times a day. Adults, 20. So, thinking about it, you should smile at least once an hour. At least. He was stationed in Afghanistan and a civilian village came under attack.

 My dad spotted a woman cowering with her baby, and without thinking he just ran forward to save them. But... He didn't see the land mine. - How was work? - Good. Mrs. Anderson got a new hip. Kathy's still fussing over Mr. Williams, but Mr. Franklin's still hanging in there. He was a boxer when he was young. I didn't know that. He's got a bit of fight left in him. Did you sleep all right? Like a baby. What would I do without you?

 Probably starve and die. Anyway, I got to go. My mates have been waiting for me. Mum. Bye! Get off him. - What's it to you? - Just get off him. What are you doing? It's not worth it. And who are you? His boyfriend? You're the one enjoying sitting on top of him. Getting off on it? Freak! Do you think she's dying? We're all dying. She had a fall and broke her hip, that's all. Are we seriously going to stay here? I thought you never got along with her, it's... Look, she's in trouble and she needs our help. It's a good option, Chrissy. You mean it's the only option, Dad. Hi, Jenny. I'm Philip, your liaison Officer. - It's good to finally meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Can I get you anything? - No, I'm all right. Just before we start, I should say, um, I haven't made up my mind yet. OK. Shall I just talk you through how it works? Well, you're going first, and you'll read... Wait, he's not be going to be there, right? He's requested to be there, yeah. I can't... I can't be in the same room as him. Well, you can petition that he isn't in the room if you're going to find it too distressing, but he can appeal. They're going to let him out, aren't they? I don't know. They do take everything into account. His psychiatric evaluation, his behaviour in prison, your victim statement. So, you think that could sway the board? Yes, it could. In person it's powerful. I've seen it happen before. My son is still a child. I cannot let that man anywhere near him. - Hi. - Hi. - Thanks for this morning. - It's OK. Haven't seen you on the bus before. My dad usually drives me in but he's away on business. - What kind of business? - Hi, Sam. He... He builds drills, he's an engineer. What about yours? He died. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. He was stationed in Afghanistan. Civilian village came under attack, my dad spotted a woman cowering with her baby, without thinking he ran forward to save her. He didn't see the land mine. He sounds like a brave man. Yeah, he was. Were you scared? On the bus? A bit. Actually, I was terrified. Everything went black. Then it went white. Then I heard your voice. I can't do it. Yes, you can. No, I... I really can't. What are you scared of? Everything. Come. Come with me. I need you to believe in yourself. Oscar! Help! Sam? Sam! Look, I told you you could do it! I... I thought you were dead. You... Sammy! Sam! What the fuck? Bastard! Fuck. What are you doing? Making it nice for when she gets home. Do you want to give me a hand? - Will she mind? - Well, she might at first, but I'm sure she'll be pleased in the long run. You can't find anything in here. Give me. Old habits die hard. When are we going to go and see my gran? Well, I think I should go on my own first. Why? I need to see how she is. I thought you said she'd only broken her hip. I haven't seen her in a long time, Chrissy. All right? I don't know how fragile she is, what kind of a state she's in! - Calm down, Dad. - I am calm. Look... You don't know her like I do. Come on, let's get cracking. Hi, Bob. It's Sam. Hello. Take a look in the drawer. Right here? Look in the tin. You take 'em. - You sure? - Yeah. Get out the way, Sammy. I can't get in. Mr. Franklin needs his rest. Why don't... Why don't you go and read to Mr. Williams? Goodnight, Bob. You, watch yourself. I'm like a flaming octopus here. What did the boy octopus say to the girl octopus? I want to hold your hand, your hand, hand, hand, hand, hand. Give us one of those, son. Got all my own teeth. Yeah. Now, where were we? - Excuse me, are you using this? - No. Jim just found Israel with the knife. "He for his part, took a great draft of the wine" "and spoke with a most unusual solemnity." "For 30 years, he said," "I've sailed the seas and seen good and bad," "better and worse, fair weather and foul." "Provisions running out, knives going and what not." "Well now, I tell you," "I've never seen good, come out goodness yet." "Him that strikes first is my fancy," "dead men don't bite." "Them's my views. Amen, so be it." "And now you look here, yet suddenly..." Good luck. Fill the flask, mix the solutions and place it on a piece of paper marked with a cross. Number four... Look down at the cross from above and when the cross disappears, because the reaction will turn the solution opaque, you stop the clock. Can I help you? - Are you Mr. Wilkinson? - Yes. I'm Chrissy. Chrissy Anderson. You're late. I was in the wrong lab. My timetable says Room 22. Right. Take a seat. Can you let your mum know that clothes need ironing in this school? OK. So you record... Hello, Mum. What are you doing here? I've come to look after you. What about work? I managed to juggle a few things. I wanted to get the house ready for you coming home. Brought you these. You shouldn't have. You've aged. Not looking so great yourself. - Is this your son? - That's right. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Bill. - Jenny. He's come all the way from Nottingham to look after me. He's a Detective Inspector, you know? You must be very proud. I'll get us a tea. Yeah. Fuck. Did I frighten you? No. I'm Sam. - Do you want me to guess yours? - It's Chrissy. What did it feel like this morning when everyone was looking at you? - What's it to you? - I'm interested. - Where are you from? - Look, what do you want? What does anybody want? True love. Marriage, a few kids, nice car... You know... Kids, they smile 400 times a day. Adults 20, so at worst you should smile once an hour. - At best, 25. - What's so great about smiling? It makes you live longer, and it's an attractive expression. More likely to draw people to you than to push them away. It's called facial feedback hypothesis. - Really? - Yeah. There's the "eager to please" smile. Lopsided smile. It's funny how none of them meet your eyes. You're trying too hard. Really? I've got a great bullshit detector. No, you're doing really well. It's not easy when you've got the monitor on. - There we go. - Here he is. - Sam. - Hi. I need to talk to you about something. What's up? Mr. Franklin died. Was it his heart in the end? - Yeah. - Dilated cardiomyopathy. That's right. Shame. I'm sorry, Sam. I really am. Me too. Is it OK if I... Go say my goodbyes? - What were you doing? - Nothing. I saw you. I saw you doing something. I was just brushing his hair. I wanted him to look nice. You can't do that! - You cannot be in here. - What's going on? - I was just saying my goodbyes, Mum. - He shouldn't be in here. - You should go, Sam. - You're pushing your luck having him - wandering around here unsupervised. - He's not doing any harm. He's 16. Why is he hanging around here? Well, he wants to be a doctor. He reads to the patients, they like him. Well, why isn't he with his friends? I don't think it's healthy. I was at the swimming pool last night. - I thought we were going to meet. - Did we say that? I must've got it wrong. Must have. Do you want one? Do you want to come to mine tomorrow night? It's my dad's birthday. There'll be lots of food and bad dancing and stuff. Maybe. No running! Whoever did this, I advise you to step forward now. Imagine if you've done it. Must make him feel sick. Why? It wasn't me. - Do you know her? - You know who you are. I guarantee, I will find you. It was me. Sam Woodford, my office. It wasn't him, it was me. Shit. They're not going to let him out, are they? He's got a parole hearing. - He's coming to the end of his term. - What, after what he did? They asked me if I want to make a victim statement. Will that make a difference? I don't know. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants them to listen, to know exactly what kind of man he is. And the other part... The other part is shit scared. Hello? - It was probably just a prank, but I really should suspend them. He's never done anything like this before. He's doing really well. He's on the diving team and the swimming team. This is totally out of character for him. Well his marks are fine. I don't seem to have any contact details for his dad. His dad's dead. Um, I'm sorry to hear that. How do you think he's getting on otherwise? - What do you mean? - Well, I spoke to his form teacher and he says Sam finds it hard to maintain close friendships. Well, that's not right. He's got loads of friends. Look, I'm going to keep him on a rolling detention for now, but let's make sure this is a one-off. It will be. Thank you. Right, same time tomorrow? Don't ever fight my battles for me again. I thought you'd be pleased, I was trying to help. Helping sounds like it's for the people, but really, it's a selfish act. What do you mean? If you think about most human interactions, people only give to receive. Well, what if I said I like you? That's not giving to receive. Yes, it is, because at some point you expect me to say that I like you back. It's just a nice thing to say. It's what people do. I don't give a shit what people do. Well, I do like you. Can I see you later? What's going on, Sam? I've only just stopped you from being suspended. It wasn't me. There's a new girl at school. - What new girl? - Chrissy. And I didn't want her taking the blame. Is there something going on between you? No, I just... I didn't want her to get into trouble. - My God, it's you. - Hi. This is going to sound terrible. My daughter set fire to the science lab today and I think your son tried to shoulder the blame. Yeah. I'm really sorry. Well, thanks for apologising. She's just started at a new school and this is how she introduces herself. She's been a bit of a handful since her mum died. Well, that must've been really hard for both of you. Doesn't turn out the way you imagine when you're young, does it? No. Well, none of us thought we'd be doing it on our own. - Thanks for stopping by. - Um... Would I be able to buy you a coffee sometime? I could even stretch to a custard tart, or... - a carrot cake? - Well I'm... Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Well, I'll see you anyway. At the hospital. Yes. Yeah. Bye. I'm sorry, Mum. I really am. There's something I wanted to ask you. Have you got friends at school? What are you talking about? What did the Head say? She said you didn't form close friendships. What would she know? She barely knows who I am. I don't know, she asked your form teacher then. He thinks there's something wrong with everyone. Of course I've got friends. You didn't believe it, did you? I didn't know what to believe. Is there something worrying you? No. No, I'm... I'm fine. Are you sure? You haven't been yourself lately. Yeah, I have. There's nothing wrong. Can I have a hug? My dad was in the army, you see, and he spotted this woman cowering with her baby. Without even thinking, he just ran forward to save them... but he got shot in the head. He got caught in the crossfire. But he didn't spot the land mine. Without even thinking, he just ran forward to save them... but he got sh... But he didn't spot the land mine. He didn't spot the land mine. Hi, I'm Sam, pleased to meet you. Oscar's a lovely boy. No. Mum. - Can't you knock? - Sorry, I just... I need a hand with my dress, it's Lisa's leaving do. Fine, turn around. You're going out? You going out with Chrissy? No, I'm not going out with her. With friends then? Stop quizzing me, I'm going to a party. All right. You smell nice. Mum. Are you going to let me get changed? My mum did it when I was nine. It's terrible. No, it's not. I like it. Do you want a go? You go first. It's got a barbarian bonus of 60%. I'm on Emperor level. Hi. You came. You must be Sam. - Pleased to meet you. - I'm Mike, Oscar's dad. He's told me all about you. - All good things, I hope. - Absolutely. Oscar's been telling me how you've been teaching him to dive. It's a pleasure. He's doing well. You two coming downstairs? We've got enough to feed a small army here. In a minute, I'm just finishing this level. We'll be down. Oscar, come on. Shit! Let me do it. - So, how old's your dad? - I don't know. - Why don't you know? - I just don't. Sorry, you got stuck talking to him. He can really bore on sometimes. No. He's great. Try having him as your dad. Hey, how is it going? That looks good. Watch your fingers. OK, brilliant, it's not too heavy? Can you get that? - Yeah. - Right, I'll get the lights. - You're missing the party. - Yeah. - I've come to get us some plates. - Right, let... let me help you. You're very polite. Come on, come and join in. What? Have you made a decision yet? Yeah. But, the worst thing is that Sam doesn't know. I think you should keep it that way. But even if Peter does get out, which I don't think he will, he doesn't know where you live. He's not going to find you. But you never have to tell Sam. All good, boys? When's your next match? It's n... next weekend. - Football? - Didn't you know? Oscar here stands undefeated. Junior League Under-16's Chess Champion - for the last three consecutive years. - Dad... What? Never miss a match, have we? Follows in his father's footsteps. Sam dives, he's really good. Yeah, I know. I bet your dad's really proud of you. My dad passed away. I'm sorry. He was... He was stationed in Afghanistan. A civilian village came under attack, and... my dad spotted a woman carrying with her baby. Without thinking, he ran forward to save them but he was shot in the head. I thought you said it was a land mine. Yeah, it was a land mine. - Yeah, but you just said... - Oscar... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he was shot before he stood on the land mine. Do you want a blow-by-blow account of how my father died? Do you? Look, he was a brave man. I'm sure he was. No, no, I'm sorry. Just... Thanks for the party. Sam, I've got fish and chips. Sam! Sam? It's late. I know, I just came to read to you. OK, Sam. "As he would start speaking," "he had risen from bed with almost..." Sam. Has something happened? Where've you been? Party. I should like to... Be your age again. I met my wife at a dance. I bet the girls love you? There's no-one. I can't believe that. Good looking boy like you. What's her name, Sam? I told you there's no-one. Is she the reason for the long face, son? Don't call me that. Sam? Sam, what are you doing? Is it something wrong with my machine? Listen, Sam, I really don't think you should... You should wait till the... Stop, stop. Shut up. Shut up, shut up. That's good. That's better. Sam. I was just getting my book. I just want to say that I'm really sorry about the other... the other day. It won't happen again. OK. - Goodnight, Cathy. - Goodnight. - Sam, what are you doing? I'm just show her where Mr. Williams died. - I need to speak to Sam. - Why? Well, he was here last night wandering around as usual. I've done something terrible. I told Sam his dad is dead. - And he's not. - Hi, son. Hi. Hi, son. - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com -
