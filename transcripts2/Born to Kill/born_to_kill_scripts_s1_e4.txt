 Born to Kill (2017): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 Sam's therapist is troubled by his indifference to others and apparent hero worship of his father, after which he and Jenny attend Cathy's funeral, where Jenny is perturbed to see Chrissy wearing the crucifix Sam stole from her friend. Chrissy takes Sam to her grandmother's where he passes off another murder as an accident. Chrissy is grief-stricken but Sam takes her to see Peter on his boat, admitting his crimes to the horrified girl, who runs off and is reunited with Bill. Meanwhile Jenny agrees to meet Peter, where Sam discovers his father's true nature and is forced to choose which of his parents really has his best interests at heart.

 Kathy? My dad, he's not dead. He's in prison. - What for? - Murder. Peter Liam George Shelton. I'm sorry. - What's this? - Sam got it for me. - Hello, Sam. - Dad. Look, they're the same. I'm getting out. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Take a seat, Sam.

 You know, I don't really need to be here. It's to please my mother. You feel good when you please her? Yeah. She's a worrier. What about pleasing your father? It's clearly important to you to see him. I want a good relationship with him, you know, naturally. Can you think why your mother might be concerned about your relationship with him? It's hard for her to accept I can make my own decisions. She's got good reason to worry, hasn't she? No. - No, it's all cool. - Really?

 Your mother told me about the stealing, the lying. I'm 16, Helen. Going through a phase. OK. So there's nothing special about you then? You're just like any other teenage boy. Very ordinary. Yes? What? Don't look at me like that. Like what, Sam? Down on me. You're looking down on me. Don't! You expect people to look up to you. Why? You agreed to engage with the whole session, Sam. What was the question? How do you feel, knowing your father is a murderer? Fine. He's paid his debt to society. OK. But what about James, the man he killed? What are your feelings for him? I didn't really know him. But you remember him, don't you? He looked after you with your mum when you were young. So you forgive your father, then? Forgive my dad for what? He didn't do anything to me. He abandoned you. No, he didn't. You sure about that? If anyone abandoned me, it was my perfect mother out there, with all her lies, pretending he was dead and not letting me have him. You don't think he knew that by killing James, he would go to prison for a very long time? That's what I mean when I say he abandoned you. You hadn't thought of it that way? Can I have a word with your mum? Go and wait in the car, Sam. Take a seat. So, what do you think? OK, there are traits that concern me. Right, go on. It's only an initial assessment, but Sam's idolization of his father worries me. He shows no empathy for the victims, for James, for you. He has no interest in other people's feelings. So, like his father? A psychopath? We don't call people of Sam's age that. How can he be treated? I'll find a way to afford it. Jenny, if this is who Sam is, it's a part of him that can't just be cured. But... But there must be something, there must be some help. I will get Sam a referral. Realistically, it would be about managing him, showing him that empathy can work in his own self-interest. And that will keep him safe? Keep other people safe? It's our best course of action. The other thing to take into account is, Jenny, Sam has you. Hang onto that. - Hello? - Hey, it's your dad. - I'm out. - What? - Sam? Sam? - Nothing. Dad, I just can't believe she lied to me again. Dad, she told me you were still in prison. Did she? No, I'm out. - You're actually out? - Yeah. When will I see you? I'm just getting a few things together and then I'll text you, tell you where we can meet. OK, yeah, great. And do you still want me to come and live with you? Well, we can talk about that, can't we? But listen, not a word to your mother. - All right? - No, of course not. - OK. - I've got to go now, OK? - OK. - It was good speaking to you. - You too. - Bye for now. Bye. That was Chrissy. Are you still coming to Kathy's funeral? Absolutely. Bill wants to be there for you. So... Do I get to go to prison to visit my dad? That was the deal, wasn't it? I'll call and make the arrangements. Chrissy, we're going to be late. Can you help me with this? Yeah. I could never do this. There we are. Let me look at you. - Lovely. - Yeah, I'm good at funeral wear. Sorry, that was childish. What time will you be back? It's not as if you knew the woman. Go and wait for me in the car. All right, Dad. You know it was the nurse, the nurse that looked after you so well. - Well, that's her job. - Yeah. And that's why I came back here, to look after you. - But every single time... - Oh, you didn't have a choice. You were on your uppers. All right, yeah. Being honest, it was partly that. But I wanted to be a good son, and I thought that Chrissy should have a grandma. She's turned out all right. Despite her mother. Right, two weeks. What are you talking about? I'm going to stay here another two weeks, I'm going to organise you some outside help, then Chrissy and me, we're off. I have loved you, Mum. I still love you. But I love Chrissy more. I can't have her living in this poison! - How will I manage? - I'll set it all up. You'll be well looked after. Bill! I can't believe she went like that. There are more painful ways to go. Pancreatic cancer, for example, or... a landmine injury. She was young and she died, Sam. That's sad. I'm Blaine, Kathy's brother. When she was a wee girl, she wrote a little poem for our granny when she passed away, and I'd like to read that to you, if I may. "When we are weary and in need of strength, "when we are lost and sick at heart, "we remember. "When we have a joy... "When we have a joy we crave to share... " - Where are you going? - To see Chrissy. My dad got out today. Really? My mum thought she could lie to me about that as well. Anyway, he rang me. I'm going to go and meet him. - Do it. Go. - I will. - Hi. - Hi, hi, it was good of you to come. Yeah, look, I'm... I've made some decisions - about moving forward. - Right. - I'm going to look to renting a place. - Leaving your mum's? Yeah, yeah, it's... It's for the best. Oh, I'm going to stay in the area, you know, I'm keen to stay. Chrissy's settling in at school now and, well, I've hopefully made some connections. I'd like to be around for you, Jenny. I feel like we've really got something. Look, I know it's early days but... This is really nice, Bill, but... It's a really difficult time right now. I have to concentrate on Sam. Oh, the braided dyneema. Good strong stuff. - Can I get four metres of this, please? - Yeah, sure. - Here. - No, I'm... I'm all right, thanks. You look like you needed it. Remember you're at a funeral. Yeah, I'm sorry. You're right, this is inappropriate. Chrissy, could I have a quick word with Sam, please? Yeah. - Enjoying yourself? - Yeah. You know you're doing your mum's head in? - Yeah, well, it swings both ways. - No, she's your mum. Now, look, I know you've got a lot of tough things going on right now but you've got a choice here. You're a smart lad, you've got a lot of things going for you. Is this the standard speech to delinquents? - I'm just talking to you, Sam. - Yeah, because you fancy my mum. Because I don't want my daughter mixing with a thief. That chain you gave Chrissy, you stole it, didn't you? - I didn't steal it. - And your mum told me about the watch. Yeah. Now I can't have Chrissy getting involved with this sort of stuff, so, for everybody's sake, cut it out. Do you hear me? Yeah, no, I hear you. It won't happen again. Good. Then we can all get along fine. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Hi. It was good of you to come. Well, I know that she nursed my gran. Most people are cowards at funerals. I'm not. I know you've been through a lot. Chrissy, I know you really like Sam, well, you like each other... But he has some very serious emotional problems, - problems relating... - To his dad? Yeah? But I'm there for him. It's good that somebody is. I don't think you've... Excuse me. Wait, Chrissy, listen to me. Listen to me! Do not make the same mistake I did and give yourself up - to somebody who is not capable of... - I'm not you! And Sam is not his dad. Wait, Chrissy, Sam is not... Like you even know him. Oh, Chrissy. What's up with you? Your mum just told me I shouldn't be with you. What? Hey, come on. Let's just get out of here, OK? Come on, let's go. Come on. Brian? I'm so sorry. Kathy used to wear a crucifix? She did, her mum gave it to her. Do you know where it is? Did you find it in her things? No. It's strange, I can't find it anywhere, and I turned the flat upside down. Why do you...? - I'm going to go meet him now. - Serious? More than that, I'm going to go live with him. What? Would you? You've only just met him. He's just got out of prison, you'd leave your mum? Yeah. And you'll really like him, when you meet him. - Me? Meet him? - Yeah. Come with me now. OK, maybe one day. But if you live with him, if you move, are me and you still...? Of course we will, but that's the point. My dad will get that we're in love, and he won't try and stop us. Just come. Sorry. Bill? That gold necklace that Chrissy's wearing, did Sam give it to her? I've just been talking to him about... No, just answer me. Did he give it to her? Yeah. He stole it, I'm certain. There's no way he could've afforded it. - Jenny, what's the matter? - It's Kathy's. - Kathy's? - She wore it every day. And the only way he could've taken it is if... - Jenny? - Sam! Sam! Sam, wait! It's not going to happen. You go and meet him, drop me off at mine. Whatever happens, we'll still see each other, right? Can I come to yours for a bit, before I go? Course. - Sam! - Jenny, talk to me! Sam! Sam! Come on, what is it? I think he did... - I think he did something. - Jenny, what are you saying? Did what? I think Sam killed her. I think he killed Kathy. Chrissy's with him! - They can't have gone far. - Let's go to your house first! What's he doing here?! Oh, for fuck's sake. - Hi, Gran. - I don't want him in my house. I don't know how you stand her. Who do you think you're smirking at? Come back down here! It's not up to you, Gran. I live here as well. Not for much longer. - What are you on about? - How am I supposed to manage, and where's your coward of a father? What? Stop slagging my dad off. And what you said about my mum - at Christmas, I'm not having it. - Ooh, tell her Chrissy! You know, just cos you're old doesn't give you the right to talk about people like that. Oh, you nasty thing! Look, I told you, I don't want him here! Stop it, Gran! Get off me! Gran? Gran? Shit, Gran, Gran! Gran? Shit. She's hurt, she's really hurt! - Here we go. - Gran? - Chrissy, let me help her. - Gran! Do you hear me? - Chrissy. I've done life-saving. - She's really fucking hurt! - Gran? - I know, I've done life-saving. Can you hear me? Just checking her pulse for vital signs. Help me. Margaret, love, can you hear me? Please, please, please. Margaret, love, can you hear me? - Come on! What?! What?! - Almost there. Gran! Please... She's gone. What?! - What? - She's dead, Chrissy. She can't be! No, she can't be dead! Hey, it's all right. - No, it's not. - It's all right, it's all right. - Oh, no. - Look at me, look at me. - I'm here for you. - Get the fuck off me! - Shh. - Stop touching me! Shut up! It's all right! No-one needs to know you did it! They don't even have to know you were here! Chrissy. Look at me. We need to go. OK? OK? Are you with me? Will you please, please let go of me? Chrissy, we need to go, OK? I... I need to ring 999. No, you don't. Look at me, look at me, look at me. There's nothing you can do to help her. If you stay... you're going to get the blame for it. Do you want that? - No. - No? No. We need to go now. We're going. Come on. Come on. Shh. Shh. Keep trying, Sam. Shit. Chrissy! Mum? Mum! I'm sorry, Bill. Oh, Jesus, Mum! Oh, Mum! Oh, Jesus Christ! Mum! Chrissy! Chrissy, are you here? Chrissy! Where are you? She's not there! Police, please. It's my daughter. She's a missing teenager in serious danger of harm by a male. His name's Sam Woodford. Yeah, 14 Maythorn Road, Rigby Heath. OK. Can you think of anywhere they might have gone? Peter got out today. But Sam doesn't know that. Are you sure he doesn't? Where's he living? Could he have taken her there? I- I don't know. Oh, come on, Jenny, are you protecting him? - Huh? Both of them. - Protecting him? Why, why? I'm the one that told you what he did! I'm just trying to stop him from doing what he... - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - I'm gonna call an ambulance. Hi, yes, ambulance, please. Hey, Dad. I think we're close now. Yeah, we're here. How much further is it? It's OK, all right. OK, I'll keep a lookout for it. OK, bye. Chrissy, no. N- n-no, no, no. I said don't answer it. - Sam. - I'm gonna keep this. Come meet my dad, OK? There he is. Dad. Dad! - Dad. - Hey. Where's your things? I had to leave my bag behind but it's OK. Who's this? We didn't say anything about bringing anybody. This is my girlfriend. Her name's Chrissy. Chrissy, it's my dad. It's OK. What's the matter, love? You look really upset. You all right? Her grandma just died. Well, I'm sorry. Nice to meet you. Come on board. - It's OK. - It's OK. Watch your step. Here you go. There's sugar in it. That's good for the shock. You look so much like my wife did when she was younger. Why did you bring her? I wanted you to meet her. Cos we're together... ...and we're in love. Love? The real deal, huh? Chrissy, what are you doing? I'm going! Sam, I'm going! Stay, we need to stay together now! Let her go, let her, we don't need her. Dad, I need to talk to her. I just need to make her see, OK? Get out my way! All right, go on, go on after her, go on. Don't be long, huh? Chrissy. I've got to go back, I want my dad. Wait, wait... It's too weird, - I don't know what I'm doing here. - He likes you. My dad really likes you and you can't go back. - What about Margaret? - I'm going to tell them. You can't tell them. It was your fault, Chrissy. You did it, you can't pretend you didn't. - I didn't... didn't. - Chrissy, you're a killer. You killed Margaret. It's all right, because we spoke about it, didn't we? How much you hated her. I understand you and you understand me. What are you talking about? You don't have to feel bad about it. I killed Cathy. And it's OK... ...because now me and you are the same, you see? So, we should stay together. You and me, we've found each other. What are you saying? You... - You killed... - Cathy. Nobody knows. It was so simple. Come back with me. You're sick. You're sick. You're fucking sick! You were at her funeral, didn't you feel... You don't, do you? You don't feel anything. I am nothing like you. Nothing! You're sick, you're fucking sick. Chrissy! Chrissy! No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no! Chrissy! You said you got me. Only you understood me. You love me. You love me! How could you think that now? Sam, please. Please, Sam! Sam, what the fuck? Please, no! - Sh... - Sam! Sam! I don't need you. I don't need you. Go on. Go. Just fuck off! Fuck off! So, he gave his girlfriend a necklace like thousands you could buy on the High Street. But it's Cathy Gillander's, I know that it is. Your daughter's probably just out with her friends. She hasn't got any friends except for Sam Woodford. Do you think I want this to be true? This is my son and I love him, but he killed her, I know that he did. Chrissy's life is in danger and you have to believe me! Officer, there's something you should see here. - What is it? - Can you see there? Looks like a possible carotid artery compression to me. Those are fingermarks. Right, we'll get cars out, comb the area. You all right to come with us, sir? You stay here, madam. I'm so sorry. Can we get two cars, urgent, to Maythorn Road, Rigby Heath. How soon? Give us a few minutes and I'll see what I can do. Well, you took your time. I thought you'd taken off. Is she not with you, then? She decided not to come with us. Girls, eh? Be better without her. Stick to plan A. Dad, we need to go. Yeah, all in good time. We've got to prepare. - Don't upset the schedule. - But, Dad, we need to go right now. There's no hurry, all right? She's going to tell them... ...about something I did. What do you mean? That you hurt her? What is it? She's going to tell them I killed someone. Unless... Did you? Sam? Come here. Come on. It's OK. It'll still work, hmm? Hey, do you see that? There? Untie it. That's the way. I always tie it with a slip hitch. That's it, push off. Put your back into it. Yeah, that's the way. You just need to be quick, and move the boat, all right? Come on. Get down below deck, out of sight. Sam? Hello, Jenny. It's Peter. Honey, don't hurt them. Is Chrissy OK? What have you done to... Don't you hurt her! So far, they're fine. It'll all go well, if you do as I say. Meet us at jetty number three down out by the river barrage. Yeah, yeah, I'm... I know the place. - Good. - OK, I'm on my way. And don't think about involving the police. No, no police. Keep it that way, because if you call the police, it'll all end very, very badly. I love you, Jenny. I said, I love you. Say it back. Yeah, I love you, too. Good. Sighting on the Richley bypass. - A teenager, female... - There she is! Stop the car. Stop the car! I don't understand where he's gone, where his dad is. - I don't know where they are. - OK. There're just... - Chrissy! - Dad! - Stay back, sir! - Hold on, let me pass. - She's my daughter! She's my daughter! - Leave him. It's all right. - Dad! - Are you all right? - Did he do anything to you? - I didn't mean to hurt Gran while he was around, but she fell and then... - She was dead. - No, no... Look at me, look at me. It wasn't you, it was him. All right? It was him. It's all right. You're safe now. I've got you. I've got you. That's all that matters now. Shh. It's all right. Peter. Where are they? Are they all right? I'll give you what you want if you let them go. Hello, Jenny. It's lovely to see you. Come on board. I said come on board. Sam, are you all right? Where's Chrissy? - What are you doing here? - It's just us. - What? - She ran away, Mum. We're not supposed to be here. This is - supposed to be just us, Dad. - Shut up. - Why are you saying that? - He doesn't want you, Sam. - He wants me. - I'm not coming back to you! I'm staying with Dad. He understands me. - He loves me. - Oh, dear. - Well, you've got that wrong. - Sam... Dad... I knew she'd come after you. She can't help herself. Sam, get off the boat now. Run, now. Sam, get off the boat. Sam! No! Sam! No! Come here. Fuck you! - Did you catch anything? - No, not yet. I think it might nip me. Ew! Hey! Look, you've got an actual fish. Oh, well done! I'm going to go and get a jar. All right, he's got a little one, so not too big, all right? Well done! Well done! I can't believe you did that! Hey, Sam. Sam, come here! I'm going to fucking cut you. Sam! Come here. Get up. No! You look tired. - Motherhood's aged you. - Fuck you. It's all right. You'll be beautiful again. I'll make sure. No! Sam, no! No! Sam, no! No! Open your eyes. Look at me. Look at me! That's it. That's it. Shh. I had to, Mum. I had to to save you. I remember he tried before. Tried to drown me. And he wanted to kill me. Sorry. I tried really hard to protect you. It wasn't your fault. You weren't strong enough. But you don't have to be strong any more, Mum, because I'm a man now. I'm all grown up. And I'm not going to hurt you. I can take care of you now, properly. I'll put the kettle on. Yeah. Tea or instant? Tea. Put this around you. It'll keep you warm. What would I do without you? Give me a hug. It's all right. It all makes sense now. I'll be fine.
