 No, he's faking it for the attention. As you can see, I'm in need of some legal advice. Joey, what-- Yes. All right. I know. This time I've gone too far. I'd be confessing to my priest right now if I wasn't such a bad Jew. Come on. Let me have it. What do I do? What-- What do you mean, what do you do? You've done enough, Joey. You're my lawyers. Advise. See, this guy's not getting any older. - What do I do? Do? Do? Do? - You, um-- Eugene, advise him. Uh, Joey, excuse us a second. Eh-- Told him you shouldn't smoke. Cigarettes'll kill him. Do we have to call the police by law? I don't know. I don't know. It's obstruction of justice if we don't.

 I don't think so. This is privileged. Eugene, we can be considered witnesses. Am I on the meter for this? Look. If he's not dead, we-- - He is dead? - This is my feeling, yes. You better check. Youcheck. You did a stint as a nurse, and I don't know-- [ Mumbles ] For God's sake. Don't touch him. He's evidence. He's dead. [ Screaming ] [ Eugene ] You okay? - Oh, my God. Is he dead or not? - He is now. [ Sobs ] Are you okay? Yeah. It's Peter Fineman. It's the city councilman. Don, tell her what she's won. [ Line Ringing ] [ Cell Door Opens, Closes ] [ Sirens Wailing ] [ Chattering ] [ Jimmy ] You thought I was kidding. You're on probation, Jennifer. Next time, it's jail. How many times do I gotta say it? I'm broke. Well, I don't care. This is not how you make your money. [ Sighs ] Which one is it? It's the next right. What, were you out looking for me? No, I wasn't out looking for you. And I didn't need to be, did I? You're standing out on the street corner in a well-lit area wearing that. What are you thinking? Sorry. Apologize to yourself. It's you you're hurtin'. Listen, Jennifer. Y-You're a smart girl. A good girl. I can judge character. Don't be doing this. Please. Here. Here. Sixty bucks. That's something. [ Scoffs ] You don't have to do that. No, take it. Take it. You pay me back when you get it. Thank you. Go. Wipe that stuff off your face. I will pay you back. Yeah, well, in the meantime, get a paper route or something. Don't be doing this. Okay? Jimmy, remember the song "The Little Drummer Boy"? The little drummer boy, he didn't have any money... or-- or presents fit for a king. So he played his drum instead. Wh-Wh-What's the point? Well, you've done so much for me. I mean, you've basically represented me for free. And now you loan me money. Maybe I could do something for you. Something I'm very good at. Are you talking about what I think you're talking about? Jennifer! Are you nuts? No. I'm just attracted to a very nice man. Somebody I want to give a little something back to. Jennifer, this ain't such a good idea. [ Zipper Unzips ] [ Knocks ] [ Man ] All right, kids. Step out of the car, please. Oops. He killed him. Yes, he did. [ Joey ] Well, I think we can all agree on that. There seems to be some debate about what I should do next. Three lawyers, triple time-- - Give me something I can use, please. - Nobody called the police? He doesn't want us to. It's privileged information. I don't believe this. You are criminal defense attorneys. Certainly you've had clients who have stabbed people before. Joey, could you stop talking and let us think a minute? What do we do? Uh-- [ Sighs ] We don't have to tell the police, but we can't advise you to break the law because anything you do next is-- Oh, let me think. Oh, come on. Look. Look. My lover is found dead. Obviously, I'm gonna be considered a suspect. Just because I'm gay, every homophobe across America will think I did it. "He's gay, he'd kill." It's practically a jingle. You did do it. [ Sighs ] All right. The way I see it, I have three options here. One, confess. Go for manslaughter. Heat of passion. Two, I plead insanity. Statistically, I've got a shot there. There are a lot of people who think we're sick anyway. - I wouldn't go to the bank on that one. - Three, self-defense. My word against his. I mean, how convincing can he be? He's dead. [ Snaps Fingers ] Or... I didn't do it at all. I came home. I, um-- I found him this way, and my prints got on the knife... when I tried to help him-- when I pulled it out. [ Chuckles ] That was really stuck in there. What are your thoughts? - [ Shutter Clicks ] - Turn left. [ Lindsay ] Jimmy. I'm-- I'm his attorney. [ Shutter Clicks ] Turn right. [ Shutter Clicks ] He's done. He's yours. Are you gonna tell me? I... need another minute. [ Siren Wails ] [ Police Radio, Indistinct ] - [ Man ] Watch your back. - [ Man #2 ] Comin' through. He'll talk to you. He just needs a little time, that's all. He found him this way? He said he pulled the knife out. Tried to do C.P.R. Yeah. [ Scoffs ] Homosexuals. [ Joey ] I killed him. This is all my fault. - Joey. - No, no, no. It was... because I was seeing somebody else. He killed himself because of me. It's as if I... took that knife and put it in his heart myself. Seeing somebody else? Another homo. [ Scoffs ] I'd imagine. This was because of me. [ Jimmy ] I, you know, saw her there, and I-- I told her to get into the car, which she did, and I was just driving her home. You saw a hooker on the corner of the street, so you offered to give her a ride home? Yes. And why were you seen giving her money? 'Cause she was flat broke, and I felt bad. Why was she seen grabbing your belt buckle? Something about "The Little Drummer Boy." It-It's true. She didn't have money, so she wanted to play an instrument or something. I-I-I don't really remember. I'm completely innocent. And the thing is, I wasn't even going to leave him. The other was more a-- [ Sighs ] more of an affair. The other lover-- That would be another man? Yes. [ Sighs ] Can I have the name of this man? I would prefer to keep him out of this. Look. A well-known city councilman is dead. I'm gonna need the name of that other man. [ Sighs, Clears Throat ] Marty. Andleman. And when is the last time you saw this Marty Andleman? Why? Look. He has nothing to do with this. This was... a simple suicide. We just need to check things out. When's the last time you saw Mr. Andleman? I don't want you to worry about it. Ah, d-- I'm talking to the lawyers right now. Marty, please. Calm down. How'd it go? I think they suspect the boyfriend. Should we keep cooperating? Hmm, probably. They haven't given him Miranda or anything. [ Sighs ] Be careful. [ Sighs ] I got the arraignment pushed up to first on the list, so hopefully we'll be out before most lawyers even get there. I called Helen Gamble. If she covers it, maybe we can make it go away. I still can't believe this is even happening. - [ Door Closes ] - What's up? We had a little incident. What "incident"? Um-- Jimmy got arrested for solicitation. - [ Ellenor ] What? - It was all a big mistake. I-- I went out to get something to eat. I-I saw a client who's, you know, a lady of the evening. I drove her home. I gave her money 'cause she was broke. Then she started rubbing me, and the police suddenly showed up. I'm completely innocent. [ Laughing ] Hey. This is the worst moment of my life, and you think it's funny. [ Phone Ringing ] [ Chattering ] [ Sighs ] What's going on? I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to feel it out. As far as I can tell, you're still not a suspect. But if I tell you to stop talking, Joey, just stop. - Mr. Heric. - I can't believe I am being brought back in here. - I have a funeral to plan. This is the last thing I need. - Please, sit down, Mr. Heric. Sit. Detective, Peter is Jewish. By Jewish law, he should be in the ground today. I could have this place surrounded by rabbis. Peter is not going into the ground right away. It was no suicide. Your friend was murdered. What? Mmm. And I'll have to know a little bit more about this Mr. Andleman. Excuse me. Before we respond to that-- Call me the nervous lawyer, but is this little session custodial? There's nothing custodial about it. I mean, he's free to go. We're just havin' a conversation. - Go ahead. - Go ahead what? There's no way that Marty had anything to do with this. - That's for us to learn, Mr. Heric. - Detective, look. It's Marty-- The thing is, Marty... is not out yet. If you know what I mean. If this gets written up in some greasy tabloid-- - Mr. Heric! - Look, Detective. I'm trying to tell you something here. You're barking up the wrong sissy. Marty cou-- He couldn't pierce a crepe, much less a sternum. The man faints phonetically at the sound of blood. Mr. Heric, we're hearing that Mr. Andleman made threats against Peter Fineman. You heard this from who? I think it's time that you answered my questions. Hmm? Look. There is no way I could get the case. Why? 'Cause Dickie Flood has it. Oh, great. Who's Dickie Flood? He and Bobby don't like each other. And he thinks this is a good chance to stick it to your firm. Did he say that? No, but I could smell it. But you got a bigger problem than him. What? The girl. Jennifer? She's prepared to testify against you. What? That's crazy. She can't. How? It's a lie. Will you excuse us a second? Look. I don't know your boy here. I do. He's telling the truth. Well, we've got two different stories. You want my advice? Plead this quick and bury it. You don't want to give Dickie boy the chance to go after you. No. Jimmy! No. How can you even suggest I-- This is my reputation too. No. Jimmy! No. I heard "no." Stop saying "no" for a minute and just listen. Look at me. You got a cop who will testify... that he saw you give a known prostitute money. And saw her begin to-- She was attracted. Yeah. Yeah. Add to that testimony from the jane that it was prostitution. I-I don't understand why she would do this. She's fussy about where she sleeps. She doesn't want it to be jail. But... she's being dishonest. Gee. Look. I think she's gonna testify at the probable cause hearing. I'll try to shake her, but, Jimmy, you gotta think about a plea. [ Water Sloshing ] You see-- Forgive me, sir, but I don't think you've been totally forthcoming. Detective, if I wanted to hide anything from you, I would just use polysyllabic words. Okay. You say that Mr. Andleman never left his apartment. But yet, we have witnesses that say that he left at 10 past 5:00. Exactly six minutes after other witnesses say that he heard you and Mr. Andleman... in an argument, a heated argument, in which he threatened Mr. Fineman. [ Sighs ] Okay. Let's start all over. [ Sighs ] Did Mr. Andleman leave his apartment yesterday evening? Detective, there is no way that Marty committed this crime. How do you know that, sir? Because I know. For one thing, it isn't in Marty to kill anybody. - It just isn't. - Did he tell you that he was gonna kill Peter? Look, Mr. Heric-- Joan Lundstrum said that she was out on her balcony... when she heard you and Mr. Andleman fighting. She said that she heard things. She heard the word "kill." Now did Marty Andleman tell you that he was gonna kill Peter Fineman? I need to speak with my lawyer. Joey? Joey, did you not kill him? Are you just covering up for this Marty guy? I need to speak to Bobby. No, you talk to me. I'm your law-- I need to speak to Bobby! [ Sighs ] What happened next, Ms. Cole? Um, he-- He said he might want, um-- He asked for oral sex. As a favor? No. I told him for him I'd just charge $60. And he said okay, and he gave me the money. But before we-- the police came. [ Dickie ] Thank you. - That's it for me. - Ms. Cole, you were arrested too, right? - Yes. - Your third arrest? Yes. In fact, one more conviction means going to jail, right? - I don't know. - You don't know? Did you make any deals with the district attorney, such as, say, you testify against Mr. Berluti and the charges against you get dropped? You make a deal like that, Ms. Cole? That doesn't mean I'm lying. Did I mention anything about lying? But since you bring it up, you do agree... you'd have an incentive to lie here, right? No. No? Avoiding jail, that's not an incentive to lie? I'm not lying. - You're not? Could you please look at my client, Ms. Cole? - Objection! Sit down. Let's be nice, counsel. The objection's overruled. Could you please look at my client, Ms. Cole? You're giving testimony that this man solicited you for sex last night. Is that your testimony today, Ms. Cole? - Yes. - Okay. Let's try this once more, keeping in mind that perjury is a punishable crime. Objection! Sit down! Ms. Dole! Jennifer? Did James Berluti really solicit you for sex? Yes. What's up? I don't have a clue. I'm not even sure he killed the guy now. What? Well, she's right. She doesn't have a clue. The focus is on the boyfriend. Well, I thought the boyfriend was dead? Oh, no, no, no. The other boyfriend. Look. This is more complicated than it seemed at first. - I-- Can she be trusted? - What's going on? [ Sighs ] Obviously, Marty was involved and they're onto it. Now, right or wrong, I don't want to turn him in. - Plus, I have my own problems. - Wait, wait, wait, wait-- - Wait for what? For me to tell you? I'm about to tell you. - Then do it! Come on. Let's have it. Uh-- It happened pretty much how they pegged it, but what they don't know... is that Peter threatened to kill Marty. - Want to take some notes? - Bite me! Come on. That set Marty off. He said he'd kill Peter. That's what the old sack of a woman heard on her balcony. So what the hell happened? Marty was ranting. And then he left. I didn't know where he was going. I certainly didn't think-- [ Sighs ] And then later I went over to Peter's. And I walked in. That's when I found him there. Dead. Then why did you tell us you did it? Because I didn't want Marty to get caught. Plus, I thought I had the best chance of getting away with it. And... what would make you think that? Well, I-I was practically living there. I knew my prints would be everywhere. I knew there couldn't be any witnesses since I really didn't do it. I just didn't want to incriminate Marty. Are you keeping up? Well, look, look. The game is over. They've tumbled to Marty. You're not gonna be able to save him, so you better worry about saving yourself. And there I have a problem too. [ Ellenor ] Uh, uh, what? Wh-- Excuse me. What's the problem? Um, during the argument, when Marty said he would kill Peter, I... kind of dared him. What do you mean, you dared him? I accused him-- I might have said something like, "You fey little fly, you don't have the stones to kill a roach." And then I tossed him the keys to the apartment, and I said, "Go ahead. Show me." I didn't for a moment think that he would. But I may have incited him a little. All right. Um-- We-- We-- We might be able to wiggle you out, but you're gonna have to give 'em Marty. - I can't do that. - Well, you don't have a choice. You covered up after the fact, and they may be able to make an accessory charge before the fact. You gotta play ball now. Joey. Um, Marty. - These are my lawyers. It's fine. - Joey, they think I did it. They're asking me all kinds of questions. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Joey. They're after me. They're after me. They are. It's okay. Helen, this is a major screw job. I don't know what to tell you. Things look like they look. There was no way he wasn't gonna find P.C. Jimmy? Can I talk to you in private? I'm so sorry for this. Just tell me why. They told me that I would go to jail, but nothing would really happen to you. Something's already happened to me, Jennifer. I gotta go. Wouldn't be trying to obstruct justice, now would we? You don't know me, Mr. Flood. Really? Tell me about yourself. I'm just a joe with a long memory. Funny. So am I. [ Elevator Bell Dings ] All right. Listen, Bob. I need an appointment with the D.A. tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Okay? Great. I'll hold. Look. I told you, Marty, I'd keep you out of it. So don't worry. Don't worry. The point is, you haven't kept me out of it, Joey. I think it's time for me to go get a lawyer. Well, if you do that, you could look more suspicious. I-- I would just wait to see how things go. No, I told you I can handle this. But I can't unless you let me. Okay. - What the hell am I doing? - Saving your ass. The man is the main suspect, and we're saying, "No worries. You don't need a lawyer"? If he gets another lawyer in there, it can turn into a free-for-all. I can't turn on him, Bobby. I just can't. Oh, yes, you can. You dared the guy to commit murder! You threw him the keys. Then after he did it, y-you played with the evidence. Accessory, aiding and abetting, obstruction of justice-- The only way you avoid jail is to turn against Marty. Now I understand you don't like the choice, but, Joey, it is your only choice. [ Phone Rings ] How'd it go? [ Lindsay ] Not good. Bound over. What's with this D.A. Flood? Ah, we butted heads a few times. I caught him playing fast on discovery once. Reported him to the bar. Well, he's out for revenge. I think he coerced the girl into giving false testimony. Can you prove it? I think we'd all be a little more cheerful if we could, Eugene. What are you guys doing? [ Ellenor ] Boning up on immunity. Things took a turn with Joey Heric. - [ Eugene ] They're not gonna be granting immunity. - [ Door Closes ] Hey. Hey. You okay? Jimmy, what can you do? She's lying to save her neck. You know you're innocent. I'm not so sure. What do you mean? I wasn't paying her, Rebecca, don't get me wrong. But I didn't push her hand away neither. And... I'm not sure I was gonna. A hooker gets me off for money, or she gives me a freebie. What's the real difference? There is a difference. I've disgraced myself. Jimmy. You say you're not sure you were going to push her away. Which means you also might have. Look. I'm not an expert. But when a pretty woman puts her hand on a single man's genitalia, I bet, on average, most men give a little pause. [ Woman ] I will grant immunity only if we convict. Not a chance, Jean. Even with his testimony, you've got a wobbler. - Without it, you are nowhere. - We're just beginning-- - Don't bluff, Detective. - Will you just shut up? You have done enough investigating to know that you're in trouble. - You may not even make probable cause, Jean. - We're not too worried. How can you not be? There is a city councilman who is dead. People want to know who stuck that knife in him. And they will. How? When? You've got one lousy witness who said she saw Andleman leave his own apartment. Another with 80-year-old ears, who said she heard the word "kill." And a cop with a sociological bent on homos. Great. This man gives you the threats. This man gives you the motive. - Yeah, well, let's hear some more about that. - Okay. Now, you say that the victim threatened Marty first. - Several times. - The last time being the morning of the murder. - Yes. - Did you hear the threats? - [ Sighs ] Yes. - And what were the words exactly? Peter... said that he was a powerful city councilman. And that he had friends in the North End. That he would make sure that Marty was found face down with his underwear around his ankles. So that the whole case would just be thrown in the "nobody cares" file. If he gets us the conviction, then he gets his immunity. Do you think I'm stupid, Jean? Total immunity for any involvement, or he doesn't testify. I'm not sure I'm gonna testify no matter. Joey. Would you just sit down? No, Ellenor, no. No. You're asking me to betray a man I happen to love. A man who committed murder, Mr. Heric. I don't know that he did. He never admitted it to me. You know, it's possible he's just... a victim of a lot of terrible circumstances. I don't know. What I do know is... I love him. And I'm not gonna wind up being one of those terrible circumstances... that puts him in prison forever. [ Door Slams ] Just draw up the contract. I'll make sure that he signs it. [ Chattering ] [ Horns Honking ] [ Man ] Got change? Jennifer. Hi. I'm Rebecca Washington. I'm not supposed to talk to anybody. [ Door Opens ] Jennifer, please. Hey, Tommy. Could I just speak to you for a second? They told me not to talk to anybody. [ Key Jingling ] Jennifer. Jennifer, could you please just listen? Everybody makes mistakes, the two kinds-- The kind you get over and the kind you don't. Uh-huh. And there's the kind that you go to jail for and the kind you don't. Jennifer, 15 years from now, you are going to be... a different person in a different place. The hooking-- You'll be able to put that behind you. For what you're doing to Jimmy-- I'm here trying to save him, but you might want to try saving yourself a little too. He knows who my pimp is. What? That D.A., Flood. He knows who my pimp is. And he says if I don't do this, he'll tell my pimp that I turned on him. It doesn't take long for girls to end up dead, you know? It's extortion. I say we go after him. But she is scared to death. She is not going to talk. I think I need to pay this district attorney a little visit. Eugene, you can't just beat him up. That won't help. I'll just talk to him. Right. Let's just talk to Bobby first. Well, if they ever get out of there. You want jail, Joey? 'Cause they got enough to make it happen. No, I don't want jail. But I-- Look. I know it's hard to turn against someone you care about. I do. Just sign the paper, Joey, before he comes and stabs you next. I sign this paper, I sign Marty's life away. He killed a guy. You sign it and you guarantee your freedom. You don't sign it and you pretty much guarantee yourself jail. Either you do it or you get yourself new lawyers, because we're done with you. And I would have to say everything on this paper? Yep. At the probable cause hearing. Every word. And if you don't, no immunity. And it would really break my heart, Joey, to see you suffer. Why don't you go grab a pizza, jumbo? Okay, I've had enough. You know what? See you in court. Okay? [ Door Opens, Slams Shut ] There, happy? Happy? Like you're doing this for me? I'm glad you can look at this as some kind of game, Joey. How nice it must feel to be putting us through all the exercise. That's not what it's about. It is what it's about! It's always what it's about with you! You strutting around being smarter than the rest of the world! Well, you don't look so smart right now, do ya? [ Woman ] 32124. Commonwealth versus Andleman. Murder in the first degree. Steve Robinson for the defendant. Your Honor, we'll waive what's left of the reading and ask for bail. We're opposing bail, Your Honor. This was a vicious murder, and we consider the defendant both a threat and a flight risk. Simple stab wound. Crime of passion. There's no danger to society and no flight risk. - No bail. - I'll also be seeking a probable cause hearing. - Your Honor, these charges-- - Agreed. We can do the P.C. tomorrow. 10:00? Splendid. Put the defendant back in lockup. We'll see you all tomorrow. 10:00 a.m. sharp. Hang in there, Marty. Hey, Bobby? Your guy better come through for his own sake. Yeah, why? 'Cause Marty's figured out who's pointing the finger. All I've got is Joey's testimony to make P.C. And if he doesn't get the job done, then Marty walks. And we know what a temper he has. [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Sorry, all full. Right. Mr. Flood, what a pleasure. [ Elevator Machinery Stops ] What are you doing? You tell Jennifer Cole you might have to have a conversation with her pimp? Oh. Okay. Okay. So far I got you on false imprisonment. You want to keep going? I'm thinking about it. You crossed the line, Dickie. You coerced that girl. Made her afraid for her life. [ Chuckles ] And how that must shock the sensibilities of your firm. Bobby had me up on a Rule 11 once, just so he could buy time to find a lost witness. Another time, he tried to whack me with discovery sanctions just to pull another stall. He never extorted you-- No, no, no. He does what he does to get his results, Eugene. Well, I can play that game too. If I got to squeeze some jane to make a john, I got no problem sleeping. She's afraid? Yeah. She should be. - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - I think I'll take the stairs. Yeah. Going down. [ Chattering ] I can't go through with it. Well-- [ Scoffs ] I beg your pardon? You're asking me to lie. No. No, Jennifer. I am asking you to tell the truth, exactly as it happened. And if you don't stick to the truth, that's when things are gonna get ugly for you, okay? You'll lose our deal, you'll violate probation and you're looking at a jail sentence. And... what's your captain gonna say... when he finds out I got his name from you? Please. Just tell the truth. It's only a threat. Marty wouldn't hurt me. If he thinks you're the one who's putting him away. Maybe I shouldn't be putting him away. Just review the document. Marty's defense will be able to subpoena the immunity agreement. So if your testimony waivers from this, you screw it all up. You're on. [ Sighs ] Let's go. What's up? What's up? What's up is you've got a vendetta against Bobby Donnell. [ Chuckles ] You think so? Yeah, I do. [ Flood On Tape ] He does what he does to get the results he needs. Well, I can play that game too, Eugene. If I gotta squeeze some jane to make some john, I'm gonna have no problem sleeping. [ Player Stops ] He was wearing a wire. He's got one of those fillings that picks up radio signals. So what? I didn't say anything there. We always squeeze during plea bargaining. [ Flood On Tape ] And what's your captain gonna say when he finds out... that I got his name from you? [ Jennifer On Tape ] Please. What the hell is this, Dateline? Bodily harm, you threatened. What are you doing? We all know you don't like Bobby Donnell. This doesn't smell good, Dickie. Let it go. What the hell is your interest in this, Helen? I don't like it. Let it go. And if I don't? I'll get involved. You think you got a shot, you take it. I will. Keep going ahead with this case, I definitely will. I gave Berluti a lie detector. He passed it. Drop the case, or we've got a war. [ Chattering ] It's over. Case dismissed. Really? Consider it expunged. Oh, my God. Thank you. For the rest of my life, I-- You don't even know me. I know her. I-- Oh. [ Laughs ] Congratulations. Jimmy? Can you ever forgive me? [ Helen ] She did a good job getting him on tape. She was very brave in the end. I know I can't really undo what I did, but I am sorry. I believe you. And I'd forgive you, but... I'm afraid you'd get all grateful on me, which is... kind of what started everything. [ Chuckles ] So Mr. Fineman first threatened Mr. Andleman's life? Yes. Peter-- He said that since Marty was gay, the police would probably fob it off to the vice squad, where it would collect dust. He said the file would probably decompose before Marty did. Do you have an opinion as to whether Mr. Andleman took these threats seriously? I know we both did. [ Jean ] When was the last of these threats made, Mr. Heric? The day of Peter's death. [ Jean ] Could you describe... the events of that day which led up to the time that you discovered Mr. Fineman? [ Sighs ] Yes. Marty had just been threatened again, and he was reacting in an out-of-control manner. [ Jean ] Out of control. How so? He said he'd kill Peter. I mean, he was just saying it in my mind, or so I thought. Then he and I got into it. - You two got into it? - Marty was blasting me for letting it get to this point. We shouted. All of a sudden, I'm accusing him of not having the courage to kill Peter. You said that to him? Yes, I-- I suppose, in a way, I-- I challenged him to do it. Then I tossed him the keys to the apartment... and said, "Go ahead. Do it." And then what happened? He left. I still-- I still didn't think he would do it. About an hour passed, and he hadn't come back. I decided to drive over there. And when you drove over to Peter Fineman's apartment, what did you find? Peter. - Dead? - Not yet. He was still alive when I got there. It hadn't happened yet. Well, then, what happened next? Peter and I got into a huge argument. I-- I lost my temper. [ Sighs ] And I picked up the knife and stabbed him. [ Spectators Murmuring ] - You stabbed him? - Right in the heart. He went down like a sack of bricks. - [ Judge ] What is going on here? - [ Man ] Pardon me. Mr. Heric, yesterday you told me that Mr. Andleman did it. I did not, counsel. I said he had threatened to do it. Remember, I specifically said that I was responsible for the death. You never came out and said that you had done it. Of course not. I didn't have immunity then. Now I do. I never said he did it. I continually maintained... how inconceivable it was that he could have done it. Don't get cute, Mr. Heric. The entire spirit of this agreement... was for you to deliver Marty Andleman and you damn well know it. I testified to absolutely everything on that paper. I was word perfect. - Could I see that, Judge? - No. Did you know about this? Of course not. I was as duped as you. I'm sorry, Jean. So, um, ah-- Wait a second. - When Marty left to go to the victim's apartment-- - He never went there. He went to the public gardens and fed the ducks. Can you believe it? Says he's going to kill somebody and he feeds ducks. I told you he didn't have it in him. Nobody listens, Judge. The immunity agreement should be voided on the grounds of fraud. Well, he did testify in accordance with its terms. The threats, the keys-- Your Honor, this entire thing-- Did-- Did you ever ask him if he did it? Well, I didn't think that it was necess-- Everything here is the truth. Everything he said on the stand may be the truth. Did you ever ask him flat out if he was the killer? No. But this entire thing was premised on the f-- on that Marty was the killer. Well, he is guilty of murder. And you are guilty... of a god-awful, sloppy immunity agreement. But the bottom line is, it's enforceable. He is a free man. And you wonder how I can strut around feeling smarter. Your Honor, I want to conduct a hearing to establish the validity of that contract. The contract says what the contract says. Unfortunately, I signed off on it. - Now I would like to know what part you two played in this. - None. He spun us from the beginning. You bet I did. And it was delicious. I mean, I had him shoving that agreement down my esophagus. - You should have seen it. - We can still file federal claims. Oh, come on, skinny. You don't think I checked that out? Your only appeal is on the talk shows. Ooh-- Go sell a book. [ Door Closes ] [ Rebecca ] Mmm. Okay. What happened? Well, everything worked out for Joey too. He's free and clear. Well, this is good. Listen, uh, I-I would have said this an hour ago, but I was afraid I'd get weepy. The way you three stuck up for me, I'm never gonna forget that. I remember sittin' with my dad when I was little, when this limo drove by. I-I said, "I want to grow up to be rich someday too." He said, "You can't tell from limos if a guy's rich. You gotta measure his friends." Well, working with you guys, being able to count you as my friends, I feel pretty-- I know you went to her hotel, and I know what you said. I wish my dad coulda met you. He'd see how rich I turned out to be. [ Man ] Marty, did you know? No, I had no idea. I just found out in the courtroom, just like the rest of you. I was stunned. Why'd you kill him, Mr. Heric? I didn't like his politics. Plus, he threatened a loved one. I was prepared to go with self-defense. Fortunately, I was granted immunity. I think the main thing is justice was served. And I'm proud to be an American. [ Woman ] Aren't you afraid of being sued civilly? All my assets are in offshore trusts. Oh, they can have my Heisman. [ Laughter ] Mr. Andleman, are you afraid of being with this man? I mean, you now know he killed somebody. I have no comment on that. You know, I think that eventually Marty and everyone will realize... I didn't have to get on the stand and admit it, but the truth has always been my final destination. And I think we can agree, the truth came out here today with a splendor. [ Chuckles ] It was rich. Well, we got another one off, I guess. Yep. Got to admit, we're pretty good at what we do. Yep. [ Woman ] You stinker!
