 [guitar being strummed] [producer] Sadie, tell me, what are you gonna be when you grow up? A rock star. [producer] What kind of music are you gonna play? -What? -[producer] What kind of music? Famous music. [laughs] [Dr. Sanders] Our next patient is Sadie. [man] You're very funny. I know. [Dr. Sanders] Sadie is this really charming seven-year-old

 who has this absolutely terrible brain disease. [doctor] Can you say, "Have a nice day?" Have a nice day. [Dr. Sanders] When I heard about Sadie's story, it made me wanna do something to see if... I could do anything to help. There's nothing more difficult than having a sick child, even if you're a doctor. I remember when my younger child was sick, she was wheezing. She was maybe three or four. She came into my room, and she woke us up and she said, "Mom, I can't breathe." And so I'm like, "Okay, I'm taking you to the hospital." So I called up our pediatrician and he said, "Did you listen to her?" And I said, "Yeah, and she said she couldn't breathe."

 Pause. "With your stethoscope?" So, of course, I hadn't even considered listening to her with my stethoscope because I was just reacting as a parent. I can't imagine what Sadie's parents are going through. -[doctor 1] Bone thickness. -[doctor 2] Five. [Dr. Sanders] Sadie's parents have to make some really tough decisions for her soon, and I hope the crowd can help. [whirring] [woman] Hold onto me. -[woman] Come here. Hold my hand. -You and I need to hold your hand too. [Sadie] Whoo! [woman] All right. You got it? -Yeah. -Yeah. [producer] What's your name? Sadie Hana Gonzalez. And I'm seven. And I live in Queens. [satnav] Continue on Grand Central Parkway for three miles. [girl chuckles] It's okay. Mama. [Ruby] Her Rubik's Cube got broken. -No. -[Sadie's mother] What happened to it? You can fix it. [Sadie's mother] Are we scooting or not scooting? Yeah, scooting. [Ruby] Well, we have to be careful if we have ticks, right? Yeah, but this-- There's not deer in Flushing Meadows. [Ruby] Let's go. [laughs] Whoo! [Sadie's mother] Sadie, if you feel like you get wobbly, just stand still, okay? Whoo! [Sadie's mother] Sadie, remember, if you feel wobbly, then you stop. -[Sadie] Stop, guys. -[Sadie's mother] Okay. Take a break. [Ruby] She has a seizure! I don't like the seizures. Sometimes it happens to my leg or my toe. Every time I walk, I almost fall down. [producer] When you have a mouth seizure, can you talk? No, not really. I try. -[producer] Tell me about that. -But I just clap. When they hear me, they come. [clapping] [producer] You having one now? You okay, sweetie? [exhales] [gulping] -[producer] You okay, sweetie? -Yeah. [Sadie's mother] We just never thought this could happen. How do you change your expectations of... of what life... was? [Sara] Sadie was born with her eyes open, and she was just taking in everything and just... She just had this sort of old soul and was very interested in people and everything. She's just a character. She's always been since... since the moment she was born. She was just Sadie. She's always been herself. [cheers] [in Spanish] She's unique. She is... bright, happy, content. I don't know where this illness came from. But for six years of her life, she was 100%... and then suddenly this? It's like a dream. [Sara] So we went away between Christmas and New Year's. We got an Airbnb in the Catskills just to get away for a couple of days. The kids had a great time, and then we drove home. It was December 28th. We drove home. We had dinner at home. Everybody was fine. And then, um... the morning of the 29th, Jose called me and said, you know, "Something's wrong with Sadie. She seems strange." I got home and... she just wasn't responsive. So I called 911. The doctors were able to recognize that she was having a seizure. [producer] So you woke up in the hospital? [Sadie] Yeah, I was sleeping. I was like, "Where am I?" -[producer] Was that scary? -No. I was just... curious. [Jose] She never had another visible seizure the whole time that we were in the hospital, but they had hooked her up to an EEG and said that she was constantly having subclinical seizures the whole time and they didn't want to send us home until she was 24 hours seizure-free. We were there for almost two weeks. But then very early February, she started having visible seizures. [Sara] You okay, sweetie? Sadie's seizures don't respond to medication at all. The doctors put her on steroids which immediately changed her physically. From one day to the next, you know, she blew up and, within three weeks, gained 20 pounds. [Ruby] Can I try? [Sara] The steroids were supposed to help with inflammation, but it didn't stop anything, but it did cause a lot of other physical problems for her. [Sara] Turn this way. I can't. -[Sara] Can you sit up? -No. -[Ruby] Okay. -[Sara] Help me. [Jose, in Spanish] I can't stand to see my daughter this way. And I pray to God a lot... that she can return to who she was before. She's very affected by this. [Dr. Sanders] Sadie's story really touched me. The quality of her life has worsened dramatically over the past year, and her parents are worried that they're gonna lose her to a disease that they don't even understand. [Jose] Sadie? You okay, baby? Sadie's now having a seizure every couple of minutes. They're called focal motor seizures and they affect just one part of her body. For Sadie, it's mostly her mouth and her tongue, her left arm, and her left leg. During these seizures, she's awake and aware, but totally powerless to stop them. Soon after her visit to the ER, Sadie's parents transferred her care to the neurology department at Columbia Presbyterian. Sadie had several MRIs that showed that she didn't have a brain tumor and that she hadn't had a stroke, and she had a spinal tap that showed no sign of infection, nor any antibodies that would suggest an autoimmune disease. But after just four weeks, Sadie's symptoms did lead some doctors to propose one diagnosis. And it's called Rasmussen's, and it's just really one of the worst diagnoses you can get. Rasmussen's encephalitis is characterized by chronic inflammation. In this disease, a certain kind of white blood cell, T lymphocytes, invade half of the brain and destroy it. The standard treatment for Rasmussen's is something known as a hemispherectomy where all the connections between the diseased half of the brain are cut. This stops all the seizures and prevents the disease from spreading to the healthy part of the brain. But the consequences of a hemispherectomy are devastating. Sadie would lose vision in one eye, she would lose the ability to move an entire half of her body, and if her language center is located in that half of her brain, she'd even lose the ability to speak. Superman is on the way! [Dr. Sanders] But if this diagnosis of Rasmussen's is correct, and if she doesn't have the operation, then her brain will gradually deteriorate and shrink. Most children who don't have the surgery become paralyzed on one side of their body within a few years. [Sara] Once you Google Rasmussen's encephalitis, it's a pretty horrifying thing to read about because it's a disease with no cure. Can you help me, please? [Sara] They did a biopsy, and they could prove that she has encephalitis, which means her brain is inflamed, but they couldn't prove anything else. In my opinion, I feel like they sort of landed on this decision and stopped looking for other reasons for the encephalitis. [video call ringtone] Hi, I'm Sara. [Dr. Sanders] Hello. So do you have any familiarity with Rasmussen's encephalitis? It's really rare, and I think that's one of the reasons it's so hard to make a diagnosis. It's really a clinical diagnosis, which is to say it's a diagnosis that has to be made based on how the patient does. You know, it's not any single test. It's how the patient looks and how they progress. It's somewhat up to the doctor's interpretation, I think, -how they-- -Sure, and I would say that... probably not very many kids -get that diagnosis after four weeks. -Right. How did that make you feel? You know, going from having a... very athletic child to having them tell you that, you know, she has this incurable disease, that the only thing you can do is, you know, remove half of her brain or disconnect half of her brain, it's... sort of mind-boggling. I mean, it's hard to even hear that and think that it's... Like, how could that be the only thing? How could that be the only thing you do to a kid? -So-- -Wow. Yeah. I'm really hoping to... find a different, like, direction to go in with Sadie because I feel like where we are right now doesn't feel right to me. Sure. -Yeah. -Absolutely. Well, what I was gonna suggest is that you go to see a doctor outside -to get a second opinion. -Right. Bye-bye. [Dr. Sanders] Sadie's parents are desperate for other opinions, opinions that might give them other options. [Sadie] That's the wind. [Sara] Just the wind. -The wind knocked you over? -Yes. [Dr. Sanders] I tell patients all the time, you might not think it, but your doctor wants you to get a second opinion. You know, nobody likes to be stumped, but a second opinion, a second set of eyes, a second brain to think about something, that's important. If I was told that my child had a disease that required her to be maimed, I would be doing the same thing. So you're coming here for a second opinion about everything. Is that right? -Uh-huh. -Okay. Good. [Dr. Marcuse] You were admitted to Columbia for ten days. [Sara] Yeah. They put her on Keppra for her seizures. She was only on Keppra for maybe, um... during the hospital and then about maybe two weeks after. -It didn't-- It made her very aggressive, and it didn't seem to be the best medication for her. Mom, why did it make me aggressive? -Sometimes medication can do that. -[Dr. Marcuse] That's what it does. I don't really understand. [Sara] It's a side effect of the medication. What's a side effect? [Sara] Something that could happen to you when you take something. I got a curse? [Sara] No. Not a curse. -Did steroids help her with the seizures? -No, they didn't help at all, -and then the side effects were major. -Okay. -Can we put you up here for a few minutes? -Yeah. Yeah? So that I can examine you more. [Dr. Marcuse] Hi. I'm Lara Marcuse. It's nice to meet you, sir. -[Sadie] That's my dad. -That's your dad? I figured it had to be, not just, like, some guy coming in. Okay, ready for the knees? Okay. One, two. [giggles] Are you trying to kick me? No! I did not do it on purpose. I know. I know. [Sara] Are you having a mouth seizure right now, lovie? [Dr. Marcuse] Yes, you are. Can you, "ah"? Can you say, "Have a nice day?" Have a nice day. Okay. Can you spread your fingers nice and wide? Okay, don't let me move these fingers. Strong... [Sadie] Leg! Leg? Okay. Let me see. Oh, yeah. All right. Okay. Do you still feel like you're having it? -No. -It's already done. -Yep. -It's all right. We're gonna throw that one away. Okay. [Dr. Marcuse] So I think in this office visit, I saw maybe eight seizures. I can say, just from this brief time, that there's a part of the brain that's in the frontal area where the mouth is that's involved for her. -[Sara] Mm-hmm. -And then very far away from that, in the mesial side of the brain where the leg is, that's involved, and then behind all that, in the sensory area where the arm is, that's involved as well. So we tend to be pretty aggressive with surgery here, and a hemispherectomy is the-- like, it's the gold standard for Rasmussen's. And it's the thing that controls the seizures. [Dr. Marcuse] So seizures aren't particularly healthy for the brain. Seizures are kind of like fight night for the brain. Like, it traumatizes the brain, and over time, it will decrease the ability of the brain to function, so that's why we do everything we can to really control seizures 'cause if we can control seizures, we can help to preserve the function of the brain. So the thing that makes this so hard is if you're gonna do a hemispherectomy, the earlier the better. So that's the decision that's in front of us. [Dr. Sanders] Hemispherectomy doesn't have to cause paralysis on one side of the body. If the patient gets this surgery when they're really, really young, because their brain is so flexible, so plastic that they can replace what they're not getting. But the opportunity of regaining control of that part of your body, it's a very short window. Sadie's past that age. It doesn't go past four or five, and Sadie was six when this started, so beyond the likely window. So she might be able to walk, but she'll never walk completely normally. It's possible that she'll have a normal intelligence. Maybe she won't be as brilliant as she might have been, but of course we never know what might have been. -[birds chirping] -[guitar music playing] I'm doing a sad song. -It's not funny. -[Sara chuckles] I'm sorry. [Sara chuckles] It's called... "Miss You, Jordan." -She's gonna be crying soon. -I know! She's gonna get upset. -Hey! -Sorry. Sorry. [Sadie crying] [door closes] How dare you do that to me? What did I do? I didn't do anything. [Sadie] I'm sad. When I hear... sad songs, I think of Jordan. [Sara] Sadie has this friend that she had in kindergarten, and then she changed schools and she never saw him again. Sara] We don't wanna see you so sad, but it's okay to cry, lovie. You can get your cries out. But do you want a hug? [Sara] Jordan represents the last year that she was happy and healthy and she was in kindergarten and she wasn't dealing with what she's dealing with now, so that's where she's able to sort of express the feelings of sadness about what's been going on. [Jose] I don't like to see you like this. Why are you getting upset? [Jose, in Spanish] The hardest part for me... is seeing her like this, suffering day after day. [Sadie] I want him to come back. [Sadie sniffles] [Jose, in Spanish] If this surgery happens, I don't have words... for what will happen to our daughter. You feel better now you talked to Papa? -No, Mom. -No? I'm sad. Yeah, I know. It's okay. [Sara] I just want her to be happy. And healthy. It's hard to sort of change... your way of thinking for... From, you know, your child could do anything they want to, well, maybe they can't. [Sadie breathing shakily] [Sara whispers] It's okay, lovie. Just breathe. Okay? [Dr. Sanders] If it's Rasmussen's, the possibilities of what's going to happen are pretty limited and terrible, and the therapy is also terrible. So they don't want it to be Rasmussen's. They're hopeful that it could be something else. They're hoping for a better diagnosis. But if it is Rasmussen's, they want to know if a hemispherectomy is really the only available option for Sadie. "'Sadie,' she called. Her daughter turned her head to face her mother but didn't seem to see her. It was as if she looked straight through her. Sara immediately called 911. As they waited for the ambulance, the mother could not take her eyes off Sadie. She was awake but not really there." My name is Sara. I live in Queens, New York, and I am... the mother of Sadie who's seven. It was forwarded to me by a friend, and she sent me a link to it and said, "This is you!" Everybody and their mother sent me this article. I think my mother actually sent me the article. When I read the case, it intrigued me. She has some parallels in her illness that were similar to my daughter's own experience. [woman] Bartonella is classed as an emerging pathogen. It's spread by fleas, ticks, even spiders. So my daughter ended up having Lyme disease, which was causing a lot of her symptoms. Rasmussen's encephalitis will cause... paralysis of the opposite side of the body almost completely, and then it eventually leads to dementia. The consensus really was all on that hemispherectomy would be the best thing. So our daughter is seven now. She was five at the time of her surgery. [woman] After surgery, it was very difficult because she could no longer use her right hand. [man] Someone who has Rasmussen's encephalitis was treated using transcranial magnetic stimulation to... suppress the seizures. The device is a small device, probably about as big as your two thumbs put together, and it could stimulate a really small area of the cortex. Epilepsy just gets worse and worse, and the sooner that you do surgery, the better results and the better chance you have for recovering. You need to make the decision, as difficult as that is. This is really hard and my heart goes out to them. When it's your kid's life at stake, you need to go do inquiry elsewhere. You need to exhaust everything first. [Dr. Sanders] Hundreds of people wrote in, offering Sadie's parents their thoughts on what they should do. Many thought that the diagnosis of Rasmussen's was correct and urged the parents to get the surgery as quickly as possible. Others thought that maybe her seizures could be controlled with the use of electricity applied directly to the brain. A third group thought that maybe this was a neurologic version of Lyme disease. I'm not surprised by that suggestion because Lyme is often suggested whenever anybody has anything that's very strange in the brain. [Sara] "Glucose." Her amino acids are always weird. "Tumor." Only 24 people recommend the surgery. Sounds good. [Sara] This is really interesting because more people say Lyme than hemispherectomy. Almost half of the other diagnoses would be Lyme. Wow. That's crazy. And this is gonna sound super weird, but I had this dream. We were in the cabin where we were when all of this started, and someone, like, lifted up a mattress and it was, like, crawling in ticks. It was like ticks everywhere. So, anyway, when I read... a few submissions about Lyme disease, it didn't... surprise me. It made a lot of sense to me, in a way that nothing... nothing about Rasmussen's or the history of it makes any sense in my brain. So... [woman] So my daughter... ended up having Lyme disease, which was causing a lot of her symptoms. If you could find a Lyme-literate physician to order those tests-- My daughter came back equivocal, but once we started treating, it came back positive. So she's doing-- Your daughter's doing much better now than she was a year ago, -or-- -Yes. Yes. She's doing better, but she still is very young for her age, you know, but I'll take that over, you know, not functioning. I mean, she was bedbound, in a wheelchair, for a long time. I mean, she was really sick. So you are your daughter's best advocate, and doctors are human, they don't know everything but, you know, like they say, a worried mom does better research than the FBI. I mean, I-- I mean, that's all I've done. [Sara] I would love to hear a little bit about why you wrote in to the article. Well, I lived it. [laughs] We lived it. Bradley's actually even here. -Would you like to see him? -Sure. This is Bradley. You have to step back a little. -Say hi. -Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. -[Alicia] So, Bradley's 20. -Uh-huh. He grew up fine till he was three, and then he started to have staring spells. Like, almost staring off into space. And it wasn't until he had an MRI that the MRI showed the left side of the brain was different from the right side of the brain. So then what we did was we went to, I think, Columbia in the city. We saw a doctor, and he was the one who looked at me and said, "Oh, nothing we could do can help him. The only thing that could-- The only thing to help your child is to remove half his brain." And, like, that's how he told it to me. You know, things were a lot different 17 years ago. You know, I can only imagine that they've mastered the surgery even more so. Listen, he has his challenges. I'm not going to say everything is great, but if you told me I would be where I was today, and that my son would be a junior in college and will have graduated and... done what he's done, I would say you're crazy and there was no way. [laughing] It's scary, but we didn't have another option. You know, the alternative was watch him seize constantly, and what kind of quality of life was that?  I mean, that's how we saw it. Okay. [exhales] [man] I read the story. It seemed that your sweet daughter has what looks in many ways to be Rasmussen's encephalitis. There are variations of Rasmussen's, and Rasmussen's is something that we don't understand everything about. Well, what would be your opinion on, um, a sort of stimulating device implanted? That's the RNS device. We have very little experience with that in children with hemispheric structural epilepsy. But New York is the center where a lot of that's been done, and so those opinions are probably available to you. Mm-hmm. In competent hands, probably the only downside of that is more time going by where your daughter is seizing. -[Dr. Sanders] So, Sara... -Yes. Tell me what appealed to you the most. In my mind, option A is finding out if there is some type of pathogen or Lyme that caused this and that's still treatable. Then the device implantation. And then option C is that it is, you know, definitively Rasmussen's, there's nothing else to be done, and we have to go ahead with the hemispherotomy. And that's a lot more options than we had two months ago. We do the easiest thing first, that's blood work, to make sure that we're not missing anything 'cause that's my biggest sort of issue, -that I don't want to miss anything. -Right. [Dr. Sanders] A friend of Sara's saw the article in The New York Times and she recommended a doctor who could test Sadie for Lyme disease. -I'm Sara's mom, Joy. -[doctor] Oh, hi. -Nice to meet you. -[Joy] Hi, nice to meet you. [doctor] Okay, so let's start with the lab results. [Sara] Okay. The standard testing for Lyme disease involves measuring antibodies. Now, the problem with antibody testing, especially for Sadie, is that Sadie's had two different treatments that might alter the results of antibody tests. Because of that problem with antibodies, I arranged for blood to be tested at ArminLabs in Germany, and... she was very strongly positive for Lyme disease using their T lymphocyte assay. [laughs] And so I spoke with Dr. Marcuse about the results and about antibiotic therapy. Dr. Marcuse was agreeable to the use of doxycycline, so my recommendation is that we start doxycycline. We would do this for three weeks and see how things go. I'm curious to know what we'll see in three weeks. Well, the best-case scenario is that there's a dramatic improvement in the seizures over the next three weeks. Mom, can you-- I want to see your face right now. [laughing] [laughing] Yeah, it was crazy. But the number's supposed to be-- If it's above six, it's positive, and her number was, like, 15. Wow. That's so amazing. -Yeah. -That's so amazing. It would make good-- for a good happy ending, for sure. [Dr. Sanders] Although Sadie tested positive for Lyme, even after six weeks of antibiotics, there was no improvement in her seizures. Mom, another leg! [Sara] She did get much worse. She got really sick, and she had seizures that were really strong. [Dr. Sanders] So Sara and Sadie are gonna go meet one of Dr. Laura Marcuse's colleagues, who performs the kind of electrical implant surgery that was suggested by the crowd. The presumed diagnosis, the hypothesis is that Sadie has this condition called Rasmussen's encephalitis. I must tell you that I am very impressed by how good this brain looks. Looks like you've got a very high IQ, like a smart, smart kid, and I don't see any of the telltale signs of this thing called Rasmussen's, which are usually atrophy or shrinkage of that side of the brain. [Joy] It seems to me as if you're saying that it is something else. It's behaving the same way as Rasmussen's, meaning that it's becoming progressively worse and it's impairing Sadie's ability to move. The way that it's not behaving like Rasmussen's is that it's coming on sort of a little later and it's not shrinking that side of the brain. It may be because it's too recent, it hasn't been going long enough. So... that's a perfect-looking MRI, but the biopsy showed that there was encephalitis here. Now we're getting somewhere because now we say with inflammation, with irritation, the nerve cells themselves are being affected, and now your brain is irritated and it causes seizures. I would be less concerned about naming the diagnosis and focus very much on protecting this sweet thing. We know, as epilepsy doctors, that we've got to take care of the problem. We must stop it. If Sadie's right hemisphere, her right brain, was shrunken and scarred and not functioning, I would say, "Yes, that's okay. She can have a hemispherotomy." But at age seven, I would say absolutely no... if you have a better option. If you have a device that acts like a pacemaker... Scientists made one of these for the brain and tested it for ten years before saying that it's okay to use. Here, there's this little tray that fits in the skull and the battery goes in there, and this battery and computer are so smart that it can read your brainwaves. [Sadie] Oh, la-la! -[Joy laughing] -[Dr. Ghatan] And-- Exact-- That was my sentiment when they introduced it to me. I said exactly the same thing. [Dr. Sanders] A neuropace is a way to short-circuit seizures. When this device senses abnormal electrical activity beginning, it tries to abort the seizure before it even happens. The hope is that if you can stop the seizures, then you'll stop the destruction of the brain and allow Sadie to have a normal life. Our center has done the most kids out of anybody in the world, now up to 18. I have seen this work so well in young people, as well as old people, that... as this is an option now, I wouldn't go the other way toward destruction. [Dr. Ghatan] Okay. -Thank you. -[Dr. Ghatan] Thank you for coming. You all right? Was that a hug or a help with leg? -Hug. -Hug, okay. [cards shuffling] [Sadie] Uno! -What? -You looked! No. Did too. [Jose, in Spanish] Tomorrow is our daughter's surgery. It's a huge step... that we are going to be making. [in Spanish] Red. [Jose chuckling] Good job. [Jose, in Spanish] We don't know if it's the best option, but for now we believe... it's the best we can do for her. [in English] You okay? I am! Okay. [in Spanish] Blue. Really, she's suffering a lot, and not just her, the whole family. And that's what we want and why we are deciding to do the surgery. So that she can go back to... Hi, Papa. ...being herself. [Sara] Sadie's generally a very happy kid, even now. But she's really nervous about the surgery. I'm hopeful that this will actually change something for her. Just go, like... [clears throat] -Mmm. -Okay. Try again. [Sara] She misses being herself and misses... just being regular, I think, is how she puts it. [Sadie playing guitar] ♪ I miss ♪ ♪ Riding scooters ♪ ♪ I miss riding ♪ ♪ Scooters ♪ ♪ I like to play ♪ ♪ Soccer with my ♪ ♪ Dad ♪ [Dr. Ghatan] How are you, young lady? -[Sadie] Good. -Are you feeling okay? You're all set to go. Not nervous, I hope. I'm really nervous. You're really nervous? Do you know that this step, compared to everything-- in comparison to everything else you've been through... it's that big of a step. It's tiny. You're dreaming sweet dreams. When you wake up, you're gonna feel so much better. Our plan today is to place the electrodes in the areas of the leg motor cortex, since many of her seizures involve the movement of her foot and the weakness of her leg. And then other electrodes that go to the hot spots that we identified with our... our stereo EEG monitoring. At the same time, we place this computer, it's the responsive neuro stimulator, and through this single approach, now we have a tool that is both diagnostic and therapeutic. [buzzing] [Dr. Ghatan] Okay. The first electrode to be placed will be the inner hemispheric leg motor electrode. [man] Right about here's where we can start. -I'll just go back-- -[Dr. Ghatan] Excellent. Let me see the template, please. Yeah, that looks better. Drill, please. [drill whirring] [Dr. Ghatan] Please hold the tail of the electrode and I will take it. Perfection. So here we've opened the dura... to be able to place the last three of the leads. Okay, sir, let's see the... RNS pulse generator. Holy moly, Whac-A-Mole-y! Okay, good. Let it rip! [Dr. Sanders] Once the neuropace device is implanted, it's programmed and then checked to make sure that it's reading the targeted areas of Sadie's brain. [Dr. Marcuse] All right. Electrode contact looks terrific. There's quite a bit more spiking here, but this is actually good for her, but this is spiking like crazy. I'm just gonna point. [Dr. Ghatan] Yeah. Look at those rhythmic spikes. [Dr. Marcuse] So on that second chain... -[Dr. Ghatan] Yeah. -...it's a spike and a spike. That leg area has really gigantic spikes but actually, for her, this is pretty good, and that's probably 'cause she's under anesthesia. [Dr. Marcuse] The contact looks really, really, really good. [Dr. Ghatan] Excellent. [monitor beeping] [Dr. Ghatan] Hey, everybody. Everything went perfectly. Sadie G, everything went perfectly! How are you, sweet girl? How do you feel? [Sadie] Tired. [Dr. Ghatan] Tired. I would expect that. Can you give my hand a squeeze? -Nice work. -[woman] Push against my hand. -Thank you. -[Dr. Ghatan] Good. [woman] How about push against this hand? Thank you, Sadie. [Dr. Ghatan] Everything went perfectly, guys. Couldn't have been-- Couldn't have been better. [woman] Sadie, does anything hurt you? No. Okay. That's excellent news. [Dr. Ghatan] We're gonna do one CAT scan today. -[Sara] Okay. -Just to show where all the electrodes are and we'll take it from there. See you soon. Thank you. Thank you. Typically, this takes a while to... reach a therapeutic level. You can just take a little rest. [Dr. Ghatan] I'm confident that within a few months, we will have been able to make a difference in controlling Sadie's epilepsy. Everybody's a little bit different, but I'm confident that we're gonna get there quickly. [Sara] Ruby, come here. We're going on the other side. You got it, Sadie? Good job. Okay. I did it by myself. I know. I'm so proud. [Sara] It's been a month since the surgery. Sadie is doing really well. She's still on a lot of medication. But she just went back to school, and I feel much more hopeful. The doctors feel positive, but we have to wait and see. It takes months of using the device to find out if it works. [Sadie] We have to find the computer chip. [Sara] Okay. [Sadie] I'm halfway done. [Sara] Now it's smaller. She's moving her eyebrows. [Sara] She thinks it's cool that she's, like, cyborg, 'cause she has a computer chip in her brain. I don't know how she's so strong. Throughout all of this, she-- I just don't know how she handles it, but she does. -How have you been doing? You look good. -Okay. Should we look at your brainwaves? Do you wanna to see them? -Okay. -All right. So these are your brainwaves, my dear. They're looking actually, for Sadie, really pretty good, and I'm gonna deliver the stimulation that we're gonna program her at. So basically every time a seizure's happening, she'll get a little bit of stimulation. [Dr. Marcuse] Given everything she's dealing with, Sadie looks fantastic. [Dr. Marcuse] The road ahead is always a mystery. You know, in my career, I've only seen one person with Rasmussen's encephalitis have this device placed, and they're doing very well. Is this your right leg or your left leg? -My right leg. -I was gonna say that. I knew that. [Dr. Marcuse] What I'm hoping for is that over the next six months, she really flourishes and does extremely well. That's what I really, really, really want for her. Let's do this one. Nice. -[Sara] She has this theory that... -Oh, my goodness. ...her eyebrows are connected to her foot, so if she raises her eyebrows... -Wonderful. -...then she can raise her-- -She can flex. -That's really good. That's better than I've seen in a long time. I don't understand the theory but it seems to help her, so... [laughs] [Dr. Marcuse] This foot's doing great right now. One of the things I thought about Sadie from the beginning was, um, there is that inflection point with diseases where new treatments come out and things get better, and, um, hemispherotomy doesn't feel like a modern technique. It's really kind of, like, barbaric. It doesn't feel like something we'll tell our grandchildren and they'll be, like, "Yeah, we do it just the same way that you did it in your day." Like, no. Bye, sweet girl. [Dr. Marcuse] So we're hoping that we're at that inflection point. Come, come. [Sara] Before this all started, I felt very, very stuck and very trapped. I feel so lucky that the crowd gave us something to look into that the doctors were ignoring. Good job. [Jose, in Spanish] I honestly have no idea how... since so many people who helped us... how we'll ever be able to thank them all for what they did for us. [Dr. Sanders] I think what the crowd did for Sara and Jose is to give them a sense that they had time to explore other options. For Sadie, that made all the difference in the world. Now it's time for me to move on to my next patient... a 44-year-old man with some really mystifying symptoms. Symptoms that have confused and baffled dozens of doctors, including the Mayo Clinic. No one really knows what's wrong with him 'cause he's getting worse every day, so really, he needs to be figured out before it's too late. [man] Come on, girls. My name's Willie Reyes. I am 46 years old. I'm suffering from two lesions on my brain. I have lost maybe 40% of my memory. We've been to the Mayo Clinic 15 times. Had two brain biopsies, multiple MRIs, but they still can't figure out what they are. [woman] Willie, at one point, said, "Why don't you just leave me? You and Serena would be better off without having to deal with this." [Willie] Now I'm hoping somebody will see this and maybe point me in the good direction, or I could go and find a diagnosis.
