 [Lisa] Stick out your tongue. Good. Okay, open your mouth really wide and say, "Aaah." Aaah. [Lisa] Beautiful. In medicine, there's this adage that whenever you hear hoofbeats, you should think horses, not zebras, because the chances are it's gonna be something common. Were you shaking when you had the shortness of breath this morning? -Yeah. -[Lisa] Yes. So maybe this is rigors.

 But every now and then, it really is something rare. It really is zebras. Oh, I recognize... Is that Cinderella? Yeah. That's certainly how I felt when I heard about this next patient. -And he's a cutie now. -He is a cutie. The case of this little girl is so unusual that it's really going to test the power of the crowd to its utmost. [girl] Yep. [woman] Are you up for a game of Candy Land? Candy Land! Candy Land! I'm Breteni, and I am Kamiyah's mom. She is six years old,

 and we are living day to day with a rare disease. When it happens, she's paralyzed, meaning everything is paralyzed: lungs, everything. It just sounds like she is losing her ability to intake a breath. [breathing heavily] Oh, she's going. She's going down. She's probably gonna go down straight into the board game. And then it's like a light switch turns back on and her brain's back. It usually lasts anywhere from three to twenty seconds, and according to the calculations of when we did a clicker test, it was over 300 times a day. [Kamiyah] This goes here. Oops! It's hard because... I don't know what to say. [man] What does it feel like? Like I'm falling into a wall. [Breteni] Falling is dangerous. Accidents happen all of the time. She was in gym class at school, and she was paralyzed, and she went down and a kid stepped on her face and her glasses broke, and she needed five stitches. [Kamiyah] Hey, Mommy! [Breteni] A playground is a normal place where a child likes to play. That place gives me a heart attack. [man] Whoa, whoa, whoa... [Breteni] Oh, she's down. She's down, and she's all the way at the top. Tabby, go. Tabby, go! Tabby, go! Oh. -[woman] I think she's back. -[Breteni] She's got it. [Breteni sighs] I hate the park. I'm not doing this 'cause it's hot. High five. Thanks for running, kiddo. You know, she's not gonna be able to drive. Um, she can't take swimming lessons. I don't know how she's ever gonna live on her own. I want to know if somebody else has this and if there's a doctor that could help. What does the future look like for us? That's what I want to know. [Lisa] What could be causing Kamiyah's strange episodes? After looking through her medical records, I didn't have a sense of what she had, but I did have a very good sense of what her symptoms were. These episodes happen hundreds of times every day. During these episodes, she's awake, but she can't seem to use her body. It just becomes limp. They last for just a few seconds, maybe 30 seconds at the most. What I want to know is what's causing these episodes. Is it some problem with the way her brain works? Is it some problem with the blood flow into her brain? Is it a genetic problem that manifests itself this way? Kamiyah's symptoms are so unusual that it's clear that her diagnosis is also going to be something very unusual. [woman] All right. [laughing] Kamiyah, is this your favorite part? -[Kamiyah] Hmm. -Yeah? Okay. -[water running] -How does this water feel, Kamiyah? -Is it okay? -Mm-hmm. Hmm. Ah! [Breteni] Kamiyah was beautiful when she was a baby. I believe that she was made for me. From the point she was born until she was a little over two, her dad was in the picture, but we ended up getting a divorce, and I was taking care of Kamiyah on my own. But now Cory, my husband, has been in the picture for three and a half years. -Can you look straight in the mirror? -Mm-hmm. [hairdresser] And hold really still, as still as you can. Good job. [Breteni] Oh, yeah, she's gone. Are you ready to sit up and look up yet? There you go! I almost didn't catch you that time. [Breteni] As far as being paralyzed, I would say that I started noticing it when she was about eight months old... because she would start to crawl, and she'd get to crawling really, really fast, and then she would just land on her face. Could you say, "Yay"? So, I called up my doctor and I said, "There's something really wrong with Kamiyah. She's tipping forward, and she's giving us this blank stare." [Kamiyah giggling] [Breteni] The doctor said, "It looks like a seizure." So, he sent us to a neurologist, and they started on EEG. She never had a seizure. Nothing was spiking. It almost appeared as if her brain was powering down, not having an electrical surge. So, they sent us to Midwest Neurology in Omaha. The doctor's like, "I want to do an MRI. I want to see if she has a brain tumor." And so they put her through an MRI machine and, sure enough, nothing. That's when one of the neurologists in Sioux Falls recommended the NIH because everybody was stumped. He said that it is a research-based program and maybe they could provide us with answers. And I said, "I'll do anything." I said, "I'm not gonna give up." [Lisa] The NIH, or the National Institutes of Health, is the US government's agency for medical research. About ten years ago, they started the Undiagnosed Diseases Program to diagnose people with rare or unusual medical conditions. It's a really competitive program because they challenge themselves to find very difficult cases to solve. Because of that, less than half of the cases they take on result in a diagnosis. [Breteni] They accepted us. We were there for about ten days. They did everything. They checked every system: eyes, ears, skin, muscles, genetic testing, everything. We haven't really heard much back. Maybe they... can't find anything. Are we back? We're back! [Breteni] I think it's sensory-based, in my unmedical opinion. I mean, the lights in here are bright. That hairdryer's loud. There's a lot of people. She's excited. [woman] We've just got to cut just that longest, longest little bit, then you can go pick something out of the treasure box. [Kamiyah] Yay! [Breteni] She's gone. [woman] I shouldn't have told you about the treasure box. I'm so used to bribing so many kids with it. [laughs] [Breteni] The potential that joy and happiness is what paralyzes her is heartbreaking to me because if that's what's doing it, I'm not willing to take it away. It's not something I'm willing to sacrifice. If in order for her to have joy and to be who she is means that she's also paralyzed, then we'll choose paralyzed. [congregation reciting prayer] ...and forgive us our trespasses... [Lisa] Breteni is making the best of a really tough situation. She has her child with an undiagnosed and dangerous disorder, and there's been no news from the NIH for over two years. [congregation] ...forever and ever. Amen. [Lisa] Before I write about any patient in The New York Times, I always review all the records that I can get my hands on. But when I requested Kamiyah's records from the NIH, they seemed reluctant to release them. A week later, I got a stunning phone call from Breteni. All of a sudden, I get an email from the NIH saying, "Hey... we should talk about the results of Kamiyah's testing." I'm like... "What results? What results are you talking about?" Because I haven't heard that they even existed, let alone what they were. I mean, we're talking two years of Kamiyah's life. Good Lord! Uh... That's a terrible story. The ball just got dropped. [Lisa] I don't know what happened at the NIH, but I suspect that when we asked for the records, they found them and saw that there were results that they hadn't communicated to the family. Before I write my article, I really need to understand what happened, so I'm going out to South Dakota. I'm gonna talk to Breteni. Where did she go? [laughing] [man speaking indistinctly] Wow. You've got a trunk to carry all of her beautiful things in. What time does Cinderella have to be back? [Kamiyah breathing heavily] [Lisa] So, you got a call from the NIH... -recently. -Yes, and they said that they would like to talk with us that next week. "We really want the whole team there. We can't do it till next week." And I said, "I actually handed you guys my physical child and let you walk back into a surgery room with her for four hours, hoping that you would give me an answer, and it has been two years now, and I have heard nothing." Wow. Sixteen hours later, the NIH calls and they're like, "We got the test results back, and we found a break in one of the genes." It wasn't inherited from me or her dad. It created itself. [Lisa] Wow. Nothing could have predicted this. Nothing could have prevented this. Nothing would have changed this. It just happened. But that it was a break in the KCNMA1. -K-C-N-M-A-1. -Gene. They're like, "You're not gonna find a lot on it," and in that same breath, "She's the first," and so she is, um... groundbreaking. You think the NIH gave Kamiyah a diagnosis? No. I think they pointed in a general direction. What would it take for her to have a diagnosis? I actually asked them that, and they said it would take... more people with the same thing, and it would take a doctor to peg it. You do not want the kid that has something that nobody else has. To be the rare thing. [tearfully] Who's gonna care about the one? At least if I knew that other people cared, she could find care. She could get services. Being rare... it's not what you want to be. I'm sorry. What can I do... to help? What if there's another mom out there like me that was looking for an answer? Maybe they'll stumble upon our story and then spark a fire. Maybe we're not the only ones. We can do that. We can do that. It takes a village to raise a kid. I'm looking for that village. [woman] Good morning, Dr. Sanders. How are you? [Lisa] I'm great. Dr. Tifft, you were in charge of the whole investigation of Kamiyah's illness? Yes, although it really is a team of people here. [Lisa] Tell me what kind of testing she went through. In Kamiyah's case, this was whole genome sequencing, which is not commercially available. It's something we do on a research basis, and they came back with a report that actually we felt gave us the answer. Tell me about the genetic abnormality that she has. She has a pathogenic variant in a gene called KCNMA1. Kamiyah's our first family in our program who has this diagnosis. This variant explains her drop attacks. It explains her, um... slightly mild developmental delay, which is likely related to just having these attacks. Okay. Um, do you think there are others out there in the world like her? -[Dr. Tifft] For sure. -[Dr. McNamara] Definitely. Fantastic. Um... Let me get to something that's a little bit touchy. Gene sequencing takes about five months, but in her case, it took two years? [Dr. McNamara] Her genetic testing took about five months, but Kamiyah came to us just at a period where we were transitioning from an internal Undiagnosed Diseases Program to a larger Undiagnosed Diseases Network. So, her case took a little longer as we transitioned her to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, and she had such an unusual presentation, we weren't sure if she would need more research. Okay. Thank you so much. -I won't keep you any longer. -[Dr. McNamara] All right. -[Lisa] Bye. -[Dr. McNamara] Bye. [Lisa] It took five months to do the genetics, so that explains half a year. There's still at least a year that seemed to have gone by with nothing. So, I think I don't have the full story. I'm not sure they have the full story. I'm not sure they could tell you exactly what happened. You know, if we hadn't called the NIH and asked for Kamiyah's records, I'm not sure Breteni and Kamiyah would have ever found out what's going on with her. But what it means to me is that I'm gonna have to change the way I write this article, and I'm gonna have to change what I ask for from the crowd. So, I called the NIH this morning... -Yeah? -...and I talked to three people, and they said, "Well, you know, we saw Kamiyah right at the point we were expanding from one place to seven places." -That's nice to know, right? -Yeah. You know, I mean, I think they feel regretful. Didn't even think about that 'cause we would have never known. Mm-hmm. "So, do you think that there are others out there?" And Dr. Tifft says, "Oh, absolutely. I'm sure there are." Right. So, she said, at the very least, if you get more people who have it and want to be tested for this, the easier it's gonna be for insurance companies to include that in the panel of things that people get tested for. So, you know, good news. You know, your daughter is a hero and is helping a lot of other kids, and I hope that maybe they can help her back. She... -I'm sorry. -It's okay. [Lisa] I do think that something good can come out of this. I do think that they'll be able to find... community... information, but I don't want you to think that's there's all this suffering for... for nothing. Our next case is a little bit different. [man] What's that? [Lisa] It's this little girl named Kamiyah, and she has what her mother describes as episodes of, like, paralysis that'll last, you know, seconds. So, she will just freeze? -It's more like drop. -Drop, yeah, 'cause everything goes limp. She finally went to the NIH. So, for two years, the NIH did not call. -Oh! -And so we called to ask for just the medical records... -Mm-hmm. -...of her time there. -And interestingly-- -And that lit a little fire underneath them, I suppose? They got a call just, you know, days later-- That's the funny thing about The New York Times, right? [laughs] You know, so, to some extent, that means that Kamiyah doesn't really fit in our paradigm because she kinda has a diagnosis. But what we could do to make a difference in this child's life is to use the reach of your magazine and see if there's anybody who recognizes themselves. Right. Are there any others? -Are there any others anywhere? -Yeah. That would be a cool... test of the system to see if it can do that. [Lisa] It would be. [Breteni] Do I wonder if Kamiyah's gonna get worse? Very much so. I expect the worst, and I hope the best. She's one in a million, and it's actually what her name means: "one and only." Kamiyah means "one and only." [Lisa] Usually, I ask my readers to help find a diagnosis. This time, I'm gonna ask the crowd to help find others out in the world who have the same genetic mutation that Kamiyah has: KCNMA1. Maybe together we can help Breteni build her village and find some answers. I'm Breteni, and I am Kamiyah's mom. She is dealing with intermittent paralysis. Anytime I see a parent or a child in this situation, I just feel like I've got to do something. There it was on the front page: my old friend, KCNMA1. I'm chief of pediatric neurology... Your heart just bleeds for the other mom who thinks that there's nobody else out there for her. I do practice yoga because breathing and keeping the oxygen flowing helps a lot. I live in Copenhagen. I saw the article in the Facebook group. I just thought it's one of life's mysteries. [man] It is literally a loss of muscle control. It can affect the face, your knees. For me... it's like that, and, you know, I just kind of melt. [woman] My daughter, Hilary, will be doing something, and then she'll just pause. She'll just stop. Like, she kind of goes like this. Seeing the words "KCNMA1" in something as big as, you know, The New York Times Magazine, it's like, "Wow!" [Breteni] Holy smokes. You know, we kind of wondered what this would do, and it essentially opened the floodgate. After the article ran, my phone just blew up. It was all the people from this group just frantically hoping that I was on Facebook, and... they're all at varying levels of this... I don't know, for lack of a better term, disease, KCNMA1. And I saw my son's diagnosis, and I just about dropped to the floor! [laughing] So, I started the Facebook group when we got Jonah's diagnosis because I felt absolutely desperate. I really want a cure. That's what I want. I want a cure for my son. Okay. This is Jonah. Can you say hi? [Jonah] Hi! [Kristen] Yes, he's my happy boy. -Right, Jonah? -[Jonah] Yeah. [woman] Those movements that Kamiyah was doing in that one video in the article, Allie used to do those all day long, and it came back that she had this KCNMA1. I feel like it's a diagnosis, but it's a diagnosis to nowhere. I think that our kids are gonna help future kids, you know, and future parents not go through what we went through. [Elizabeth] All right. You've gotta come out of it. You've gotta come out of it. There you go. You coming out of it? Good job! I'm Lissi. I'm from Denmark. I have my son, Atle, who's 12 years old. When he was smaller, he had 150 episodes a day, and they were up to 40 seconds. Now he has, I think, 40 seizures every day, and they last up to five minutes. So, he has fewer of them, but they are really long now. I feared finding somebody that was older, and it's getting worse, not necessarily getting better. Like, that scares me. Five minutes is a very long time. [Lisa] In the Facebook group alone, Breteni found ten other families who had kids with the exact same genetic mutation. But the biggest surprise was when we heard from Andrea Meredith. I study the KCNMA1 gene, which encodes an ion channel. [Lisa] This is a research scientist who's spent her entire career investigating this particular gene. And I was reading The New York Times one day, and I came across this article. I just exploded. [laughs] All of a sudden, everything that I had gotten into science for and started studying this particular channel for could potentially be linked to a human patient that I could help. [Breteni] What else would you call it besides "incredible"? It's what we hoped for. [Dr. Meredith] From the minute that I found out that there was a patient in this world that had a mutation in the ion channel that I've studied for close to 20 years, I couldn't sleep at night. I just couldn't sleep. And so we knew that there were human mutations, but none of the patients had been publicly identified. And where do you find the location of the mutations? -Are they clustering in the gating ring? -Yeah. [Dr. Meredith] I run a basic research lab with graduate students and postdocs at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and we study an ion channel called KCNMA1, and this is a very unique type of potassium channel. The channel controls how much potassium actually goes out of the cell, and this potassium affects a variety of different physiological processes, from how neurons in the brain talk to each other to how muscles contract. Potassium channels, in general, dampen the excitability of neurons and muscle, and so it's very easy to imagine that if you have dysfunction in a potassium channel, that that can cause hyperexcitability in the brain, like seizure, or hyperexcitability of the muscle. So, what I have in front of me is a cage of mice, and these mice are special, actually, because we have taken the KCNMA1 gene, and we have actually deleted that gene and made the channel completely non-functional. Under normal circumstances, the mice have very good coordination. They're able to crawl around. They're calm. They basically have normal mouse behaviors. But when we delete the gene for the mouse, for the KCNMA1 channel, you can see this mouse is more hyperactive. And you can see when I hold him, he develops a tremor, and that tremor actually prevents him from walking properly. For many years, we had been focusing on how this ion channel functions in the body, and we imagined that there would be a big breakthrough at some point in the future, and we weren't sure where that breakthrough was gonna come from. And so it was Kamiyah that opened up the door for us. I found that, for the past two years, unbeknownst to me, there had been a group of patients on Facebook that all carry mutations in KCNMA1. One of the things that I've realized by talking to patients and their families is there are several different types of mutations in the KCNMA1 gene, and these mutations express in different ways. So, for example, these drop attacks that Kamiyah has, it's not something that we've seen in a mouse. It's not something that we would have ever predicted to therapeutically treat. And so that's something that the animal models can actually help us sort out. So, part of what I wanted to talk to you about and offer to you of making a model for this mutation in mouse so that we could understand where her symptoms are coming from. So, you're actually creating mice -with the genetic mutation? -Yes. So, you can think of it as them being born that way because you inject these genetic modifications into embryos. Got you. Okay. And that's sort of the starting place for trying to figure out what drugs would target this set of symptoms. It's not like I can hand you a drug tomorrow and say, "This is a cure," but I want you to feel like what you're getting is... [tearfully] ...someone who's dedicated to it. I have a daughter too. She's eight years old. And I know that I would want... anybody to help me in any way if I were in your shoes. I appreciate that so much. [video call ringtone] [Lisa] Were you surprised that there was somebody out there -who was actually studying this gene? -[Breteni] Yeah, and I feel like we hit the jackpot with Andrea Meredith because she legitimately cares about the kids and the science. -That's amazing. -I believe that the Meredith Lab... um, was gonna make mouses of all the different gene variants, and so that's incredibly positive. I know that everybody is incredibly thankful and a little more hopeful now. I think they were feeling really hopeless. That's great. You know, I had my own sort of hopes and expectations, um, but this actually is more than I had hoped for. What did you hope for, and how does this sort of match up with what you were expecting? I actually didn't... I didn't really know what to expect. I have a tendency to hope a lot more than expect. [Lisa laughs] That's a good quality. [Breteni] Can you say "Kamiyah"? -Kamiyah. -[Breteni] Good job! How big are you? -Big. -[Breteni] How big? That's so big! Good job! [Lisa] In the Facebook group, there were lots of kids with this abnormality. Lots of very different symptoms. But of all the children in the group, only one has drop attacks that look just like Kamiyah's. [video call ringtone] -[Breteni] Hi! -Hi! So, I'm Breteni. As far as I can tell from the Facebook group, it seems like Atle is the closest to Kamiyah. When I watch other people's videos, um, I'm like, "That's not quite it," but when I saw your guys', it was... "That's it!" I mean, seeing the video of Kamiyah is the first time I've thought that, "Okay, this is actually the same." What's life like for him now? I mean, he's 12 years old now, but he's not developmentally 12 years old. So, he's more like... six years. [Kirstine] Things have changed a little bit. The length of the episodes has been getting longer. But slowly. Yeah, it happened so slowly. Did anybody tell you that it would get worse like this? [Kirstine] No. But his breathing is only affected when the seizures are really long. I can understand Kamiyah has breathing problems. She does. I can almost hear her having an episode from another room. It's totally the same. -Exactly the same. -Yes. [Kirstine] When you hear it, then you know you have to catch him. Yeah. Of course, I dream that one day, the perfect doctor makes a medicine that can make the fall-outs go away, and then something will be easier for him. Yes, of course. I think that there's gonna be a chance in our kids' lifetime. I was thinking that, you know, on this adventure, maybe I would create a movement that would affect another kid's lifetime if it didn't get to affect Kamiyah's. But I'm starting to see that there's a hope. There's a possibility that it could affect ours, and I hope you guys can feel that, all the way from, you know, the United States to where you are. Thank you. You're really welcome, and thanks for talking to me today. It doesn't have to be the last time we talk together. No, it doesn't. Maybe we'll come to Denmark, and you can show us some fine pastries. I would appreciate that deeply. [laughs] You'll be so welcome. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. [Breteni] It's funny to see the same thing all the way across the world. [breathing heavily] [Breteni] I think that it would be helpful to meet Atle's mom, you know, but then you start looking into it and you're like, "Okay, Denmark's not next door." [laughs] [Kamiyah] Are we going on a plane now? [Breteni] In a little bit. But I've got to go because whatever we come up with for Kamiyah in the United States with Andrea Meredith could take years before they'll find a solution or a cure. Foxy, huh? So, the fact that Atle is older, it gives us insight to what's going to happen with Kamiyah. You know, we're gonna be able to see, possibly, what our path looks like. [Cory] Okay, Kamiyah, hold my hand. We're crossing the road. All right. And they have the heat lamps. [Kamiyah] Wow! Look at these! -[Cory] Let's do this. We're doing this. -[Kamiyah] We're doing this. [Cory] Could we get one of these small chocolate hearts? -[woman] These here? -[Cory] Yep. [Kamiyah] Tak! [woman] You're welcome. Bye-bye. [Cory] Bye-bye. [Breteni] Come here, Kamiyah. Look at their house! Look at their bike! [Kamiyah] Wow! [knocking] [in Danish] Atle, can you open the door? -[in English] Hi! -Hi! Come in! -Come in, Kamiyah. -Hi! -Hi! -Yay! Hi! -[Kirstine] It's so good to see you. Come. -[Lissi] Please come in. [Breteni] We made it so far. Hi. Nice to finally meet you. [in Danish] If she's crying, it's because she's happy. Yeah. -[in English] Hi, Kamiyah. -Hi! How are you? Hi! Hi! -Hi! -I'm Cory. [Lissi] So good you're here. -[Cory] Kir, pleasure to meet you. -[Kirstine] Pleasure to meet you too. I told you I cry a lot! [Kirstine] Hi, Kamiyah. Hi! Is it a fox you've got there? Is it a little fox? Come inside. [Lissi] Is there anything you want to play with? [laughing] [Lissi] We can take them out. [Breteni] This is gonna sound like we're terrible parents, but we were like, "Hmm, there's no sharp objects. She's probably not going to hit anything," and then we kind of let it go. [Kirstine] Yeah. [Lissi] Atle sometimes wears a helmet. When we are in new places, he wears a helmet. [Kirstine] When he was young, I could just smile politely when he walked into people because he's... "Sorry," and I smiled. But now when he's so big, people get really angry at him. Sometimes we make him wear the helmet only for show. -Only for the sake of-- -Only for communicating to people that, actually, there's something with this guy. [Breteni] It's like we've been waiting to meet these people, and then once we meet them, it's like we've known them forever. [laughing] She's laughing just as much as Atle. It's so cute. Meeting Kamiyah, I just want to look at her all the time because... it's... It might be the one chance I have to see somebody who is a lot like Atle. I kind of know her without knowing her. I think because I have this very physical thing with her, like... Yeah. I mean, I know she's going to fall and tip over, but I will catch her, and so I'm just really aware of her. I'm making a garage, see? -[Lissi] You are also making a garage. -[Kamiyah] Yeah. [Lissi] So, Atle's, like, putting a lot of people on his garage. [Lissi laughing] -[Lissi speaking Danish] -[Cory] Oh, there she goes. [Lissi] Oh. [Lissi, in Danish] Atle, this is like when you're falling. -[Atle] Yeah. -[Lissi] Yeah. [Lissi] Do you know what just happened? -[Atle] Yeah. -[in English] He saw that. [woman] Is that just like you, Atle? -[in Danish] Was that just like you? -[Atle] Yes. [in English] Yes, it's like when he has his episodes. -It's the same. -[Kamiyah] He has them too? [Lissi] Yes, he does. He has exactly the same one as you have. Isn't that weird? -[Kamiyah] Yeah. -[Lissi] Yeah. [laughing] Weird kids. Weird kids. Weird, sweet, perfect kids. [laughing] [Breteni] That's amazing! Holy smokes! [Lissi] Is she sleeping? [Breteni] Oh, she's just toast, yeah. I don't even know if she can wake up, honestly. Hi. [Lissi, in Danish] How is it to ride on the giraffe? Good. -[Lissi, in English] Oh, Atle just has a-- -[Breteni] Are her eyes open? [woman] Atle's having an attack. [Breteni] Oh, he is? I haven't seen it. I've never seen one. I've never gotten to see one. I'm sorry, I've never got to see it in person. [speaking Danish] Atle really likes the big roller coaster and the Golden Tower and stuff, but he always gets these major episodes somewhere in them. -[Cory] Yeah. -[Lissi] So I'm like, "Should we do it or not?" Actually, I don't know if it's good or not. And then we'll end up doing them anyway. [Lissi] Of course. Yeah. [Breteni] I'm so sorry. [Lissi] Hmm. He's okay. [Breteni] I know. It's easier when it's your own kid. -It breaks my heart. -[Lissi] Yeah, I know. Do you know, you will figure something out before this happens to Kamiyah. I feel so bad that I can't help him right now. But he's really okay. He really is. [Lissi] He's quite happy. Yeah. But, I mean, this hasn't happened overnight, so you just get used to it. It's quite horrible to say, but, I mean, that's what happens. You know that. Yeah. [Cory] Here he comes. Okay, he's back. [Breteni] Everything looks exactly like Kamiyah. Exactly like Kamiyah. It just looks longer. I fear that they become that long, but I now know that if they do become that long... I have somebody to turn to and somebody that understands. [Kirstine, in Danish] You want me to sit here? [Breteni, in English] But I have hope in the fact that he came right out of it and got right back on that ride. It's gonna be just like us. Sometimes we're gonna be stuck in that moment and we can't move and we're paralyzed, but we're just gonna have to get right back on that ride. [laughing] [woman] Kamiyah, did you like going on a big trip? What was the best part? Seeing Atle. [woman] How come? He has the same thing that I do. Atle? [Breteni] Yeah, look at that. Isn't that cute? [Kirstine] It brought a lot of energy to our family just to know that somebody else was there. Many times... I've been thinking that, "Well, don't get your hopes up." But right now I've got my hopes up. [yelling cheerfully] [Kamiyah] I drove good. You drove good? Oh, there you go, boss. High five. [laughing] [Breteni] I think there is a lot of hope now. The collaboration of all the people that have come forward and the fact that we're all not alone in this anymore, it adds a little bit more color where there was once a whole lot of gray. [giggling] [Lisa] The next patient's case is much more than it might appear at first, and it's going to test the crowd in a really different way. You want to get Freya to get you up? My name is Lashay Hamblin, and I live in Utah. I've been throwing up for two years. I haven't kept fluids down. It's just my body's going through something that no one can really figure out. I'm a momma bear. I admit it. I will fight to the ends of the earth for my daughter. [Lashay] I'm at that point where it's like, "Is anyone gonna help me?" [moaning]
