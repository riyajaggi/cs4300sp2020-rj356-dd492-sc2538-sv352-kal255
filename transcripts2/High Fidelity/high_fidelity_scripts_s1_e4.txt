 Next ex on the big ex list is Kat Mon‐‐ ♪ folksy guitar playing in cafe ♪ Simon. What are you doing in there? What? I'll come in. I'll come in. Excuse me. Sorry. What's up, dude? ‐ Nothing's up.

 ‐ Yeah. It's probably. ‐ Okay. So, um, check it out. I talked to Kevin Bannister's mom last night‐‐ ‐ Hold on, hold on, hold on. Kevin‐who's‐mom? ‐ Bannister. My first boyfriend? ‐ Oh‐‐ Okay. ‐ Number One on my "Top Five All‐Time Heartbreak" list? Left me for Hannah Shepherd? I've told you this. ‐ You Top Five‐d your All‐Time Heartbreaks? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Should we maybe wait till after I have coffee to go wherever this is going? ‐ Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Do your thing. Do your thing. I've already had three. ‐ $9.40. ‐ He married her. Hannah Shephard is now Hannah Bannister. Isn't that incredible? ‐ It's incredible. ‐ I mean, this whole time I thought he rejected me. But no. It was fate. ‐ Well, there you have it. ‐ I feel fucking liberated, man. Which is why I'm reaching out to everyone else on the list. ‐ Everyone else? ‐ Yeah. There are more lessons to be learned here, dude. ‐ I mean, like "that it was just fate and none of it was your fault"? ‐ Can you take this seriously, please? ‐ I, I'm doing my best. ‐ Okay, so my plan was to go chronologically, but since you're here, Simon, I'm hoping you can help me understand: why I'm doomed to be left? Why I'm doomed to be... rejected? ‐ You're asking me? Hold on. Do you think I rejected you? Rob, have you forgotten that I'm homosexual? ‐ Yeah, but did you know that when we got together, though? ‐ Wait a minute, I'm one of your Top Five Heartbreaks? ‐ That's why you always closed your eyes when we had sex? ‐ What can I get for you two? ‐ I'll have the, uh, currant‐forward Ethiopian, please. with a splash of oat milk. ‐ I'm good. ‐ It's $8.50. ‐ Okay. Okay. Besides the fact that I have a vagina, are there other things about me, any traits you think that could have factored into us not staying together? ‐ Rob. ‐ Yeah. ‐ I still make you mix tapes, all right. I say I like your outfit even when I don't, at all. I even let you pop pimples on my back, whenever you want. ‐ I'm sorry, what's your point? ‐ My point is, Rob, this is how we acted and I treated you when we were in a relationship, and this is what I continue to do now. We're still together. Okay? I never left. You get it? ‐ Yes. Yes. I get it. Thank you. It's great. ‐ Hey. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Take me off your goddamn list. Please. ‐ Done. ‐ Got a currant‐forward Ethiopian. ‐ Thanks. ‐ Thank you. ROB: That's fucking great! All right. Two down, three to go. ‐ So you're really gonna talk to all of them? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Every single one of them. Even‐‐ ‐ Yes. Every single one. ‐ Okay, dude? I have to say it: I think this is crazy. ‐ Uh... no. $8.50 for a coffee is crazy. This is fuckin' genius. ♪ Aura's Yesterday's Love playing ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I've been trying so hard ♪ ♪ To make ya see ♪ ♪ The love in me, baby ♪ [humming] ROB: Open the window. ‐ Ooh.

So‐‐ ‐ But I'm the only one here‐‐ ‐ But, dude, can you just go to the coffee shop, please. They got one there. ‐ I can see the bathroom right there. CHERISE: Motherfucker, just walk straight, go up the steps, make a left, walk two blocks, turn left, and you found it. ‐ Okay. ‐ [mockingly] Okay, bye‐bye. Don't forget to vote. [door slams] ROB: Hey, Cherise. ‐ Yeah, Rob? ‐ What does it mean when someone has a blue check mark next to their name? ‐ What are you talking about, a blue check‐‐ ‐ That.

She is internet royalty. ‐ She's been anointed a public figure by the Instagods. ‐ Yup. I heard she helped The Carters pick out their art collection. You sure you really dated her? ‐ Yeah. ‐ And you slid into her DMs? ‐ I guess. ‐ Oooh! She left it on seen. ‐ Wait. You can see she saw it? [snickers] ‐ She is an evil petty bitch, and I fuckin' love her! [Cherise laughing] [crowd cheering, applauding] WOMAN: All right, you brilliant idiots. I am thrilled to bring out the last comic of the night. Give it up for Justin Kitt. ROB: Justin, on the other hand, was very easy to get a hold of. He still has the same Microsoft Paint website. And he still does Thursday nights at the same shitty West Village comedy club. ‐ All right. Some of you gave me the look‐‐ ROB: If this all sounds terribly unsexy, I guess it's because... it is. Or he is. Or was. I think. There's actually a lot about this relationship I don't really remember. Huh. ‐ See, I acknowledge my male privilege, so you know I'm woke. And I acknowledge my aforementioned acknowledgement, so you know I'm self‐aware. I got this. [clears throat] Hey, you. Dating apps. Who's swiping? Anybody? Rob Brooks. I thought that was you. ‐ In the flesh. ‐ Still drinking whiskey neat like a tough guy? ‐ Still drinking vodka soda like a little bitch? ‐ You got that? [Rob clears throat] So... what brings you in? ‐ Um... all right. Bear with me here, okay? ‐ Okay. ‐ I'm kinda doing this‐‐ [cell phone buzzing] ‐ Oh shit, hang on one sec. ‐ Oh yeah. Sure. ‐ Hey. No, I told you I'm doing a late set tonight. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Oh, shit. I'm really sorry. Put him on the phone. Hey, Spider‐Man. Listen, Daddy's gonna be home a little bit late tonight, okay? Spider‐Man? Hel‐‐ Hey. No, he didn't say anything. Yes, Sheila. I did the Spider‐‐ Hello? [sighs heavily] ‐ You have a kid? ‐ I got a kid and a baby mama. And... I don't think either of them like me too much. ‐ Oh. Shit. I'm sorry. ‐ It's all right. It's just a bit of a rough patch. She thinks I drink too much. ‐ Do you? ‐ Of course. Anyway. Sheila doesn't respect me, she certainly doesn't love me, I got no idea how to talk to the kid. I mean, I go home‐‐ ‐ I don't think I have the heart to launch into the whole "why did you reject me" thing. This dude is... sad. ‐ Anyway, it's really good to see you, Rob. ‐ Yeah, you too. ‐ I know I was a real jerk and a mess when we were together. ‐ Oh‐‐ ‐ No, but listen, honestly, afterwards, I just, pff, I got a whole lot worse. I mean, I'm not trying to make it sound like things haven't been okay since you broke up with me. It's not like that, but... they haven't been great‐‐ ‐ Oh, my God, he's right. JUSTIN: You know how it goes‐‐ ‐ I broke up with him. I rejected him! God, this is great! Why didn't I do this years ago?

Everyone thinks they're unapologetic and a visionary. Everybody thinks that. ‐ Yeah, but I actually am though. ‐ Sure. Right. I get that. But just, just, just be like, just a little bit more specific, that's all. CHERISE: A little bit? SIMON: That's it! Just, like, show people where you're coming from, who you are. ‐ I am... a badass. ‐ Understandable. ‐ You gotta show 'em where you're coming from. Right? Like, badass is like a big thing, but you need someone to see something like, I'm into "Ooh!" and they're like, "Oh, that. I wanna be a part of that." [exhales heavily] That's it. Then you can put this shit wherever. And then people will come. ‐ People will come? They will. ‐ If you build it. ‐ They will come? Ha, ha, ha! Yes. ‐ I'm sorry, can I, can I move these out of the way for you? ‐ Oh, yeah, please. Thank you. Get that out the way. Drrr‐oo! Du‐du! [telephone ringing] ‐ Championship. WOMAN: Hi, is this Rob? Speaking. ‐ Hi, it's Kat. ‐ Um... hey‐‐ hey! Ho‐‐ how are you? ‐ Sorry I didn't call sooner. I was at this awful silent retreat in Bali, no internet service, the most temperamental monks. Just plain awful. Anyway, how've you been the last nine million years? What's the damage? Tell me everything. ‐ This is seriously how she talks. I mean, what is this, a John Hughes movie? Um, yeah, I'm, I'm good. I'm good. ‐ Aw. That's really great, Rob. Makes me so happy to hear that you're doing so well. ‐ Didn't say I was doing so well, but‐‐ ‐ Isn't it funny to think that we used to spend hours just dreaming about the lives that we would lead 10 years down the line and now here we are living them? It's so... I don't know‐‐ ‐ Remarkable. KAT: Remarkable. ‐ Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. KAT: So, are you in or you out, Rob? ‐ I'm sorry, am I, am I what? ‐ Well... I received a spate of these "ex calls" recently. It's probably the downside of being vaguely whatever on the internet. And everyone just seems to be going through these "what‐does‐it‐all‐mean?" trips. Remember Caitlin? I went out with her after you? ‐ Ka‐‐ Um, vaguely. ‐ Yeah, yeah. So, she called me up recently, and she was trying to rehash the past. And was I up for it? No, I wasn't. But I am open to being pals, Rob. So if you're around for a time, I'd love to, I'd love to see you and catch up. ‐ Oh, well, uh... [chuckles] I'm not trying to rehash anything. I, uh, I hate rehashing. Rehashing sucks. ‐ Yeah. You should stop by mine tonight. If you're in. So... are you? ‐ Tonight. I might be‐‐ [inhales sharply] Let me just check my, um, calendar real fast. Let me just check my‐‐ Uh... yeah, you know, I have something, but I can, I can move it. So, yeah, I'm in. KAT: Cool. I don't like this. Take it. ♪ ‐ Ha‐ha. That is exactly right. ‐ New York is full of people who make you feel not enough. There's always someone more successful or richer or prettier than you. Kat made me feel not enough. [cash register dings] She also made me feel special. Until she left me. After which I felt... especially not enough. ‐ You wearing lipstick? ‐ No. ‐ That's lipstick. ‐ Shut up. It wouldn't be till Mac that a person made me feel both special and enough. And if you find that person in this fuckin' city, you're crazy if you let them go. Ugh. [street traffic] Turns out I'm crazy. ♪ electronic music playing faintly ♪ [clears throat] ♪ electronic music grows louder ♪ ‐ Rob. ‐ Hey, Kat. How are you? Mmm! KAT: Oh! ‐ Are you still smoking? ‐ Yeah, a little. WOMAN: Kat! You need to tag me in the pictures. KAT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. ‐ Oh, shit. Am I, am I crashing? ‐ What? No, no. Not at all. I told you it'd be a time. ‐ A time, right. That's a lot of people. Wow, this‐‐ Oh! Hmm. Got a... got a little‐‐ Can I? ‐ Yeah. I... got a little lipstick on. This is cool? This is‐‐ You got some swings. ‐ Yeah. Just throw your shit everywhere‐‐ ‐ Oh, yeah, cool. Oh, I, um, I bought a little‐‐ ‐ Oh, my God! Dude! Oh, my God! Do you remember the time when we just drank the cheapest beer, and nobody gave a shit? ‐ Yeah. ‐ So young and free. ‐ Yeah, I thought it would be funny to bring it. ‐ Yup. You know, I got the cutest jacket today. And I think, I think you might be the only person here who could just pull it off. Trust me, just try it on. ‐ I think, I'm fine. It's‐‐ ‐ Trust me. ‐ Might be a little hot for this, no? ‐ Mm, no. It's breathable. God! Okay. You're fucking remarkable. Oh, my God. Hi, baby! Pretty good, right? ‐ Yeah, this is. Oh, hey. Um, I'll be right back. Mingle. ‐ Oh‐‐ Okay. [party chatter] ‐ Hey, can you help me with a photo real quick, over there? ‐ Oh, I'm, I'm not really good at that. Maybe you wanna ask someone‐‐ ‐ No, no, no, you don't have to be good. Like, you just come here. Like, make it look very fucked up and vibey, okay? Just‐‐ ‐ Oh, okay. All right. All right. ‐ Wait. Turn the flash on, please. ‐ Oh, sorry. Okay. ‐ Is it on? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Okay. Good. ROB: Hot. ‐ Does it look real? ‐ Uh, yeah, looks, looks real. ‐ Does it look fucked up and vibey? ‐ Um‐‐ ‐ Wait, can you see the can? ‐ Yeah, the can's in the photo. ‐ Cool. ‐ Looks pretty fucked up. ‐ Oh, sick. Thank you very much. ‐ Yep. ‐ [Kat clears throat] ‐ [bell tinkling] ‐ Dinner time! Come on. That's when I told her, no, you can't come to my birthday party. 'Cause Beyoncé might be there and you fucking bit her. [laughter] ‐ Kat tells me you own a record store? ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ That's so dope. I've always been shy about my musical preferences for, like, fear of judgment. ‐ Most of it comes down to just blind conviction. ‐ Exactly. Like, do men feel the need to justify everything? No. They just... take up space, exist. ‐ Right. ‐ It's so bad‐ass for you to not only occupy but freaking own... such a historically masculine space. ‐ Yeah, I guess it is kind of bad‐ass. I should hate these people. And I think I do, but just... give me a second. ‐ So how do you know Kat? ‐ Um... we used to date. But now I guess we're pals. Yeah. How about you? ‐ Well, to be honest, we've actually never met IRL. But I've followed her for months. ‐ Right. ‐ Actually, this is the first time meeting anyone here. ‐ What? ‐ Don't get me wrong, I'm usually averse to doing these Instagram Influencer meet‐ups. But we're getting paid so much to hawk this Soju shit. Korean money runs deep. Take a selfie. ♪ hip‐hop music playing ♪ ♪ [indiscernible conversations] ‐ Yeah. I hate these people. They're awful. And the most awful of the awful? Fucking Kat Monroe. KAT: Nobody in this world is making‐‐ ROB: She doesn't listen to anyone, she says terrible stupid things that mean absolutely nothing, and she totally gets away with it, because no one here cares what you say as long as your selfies are lit right. [shutters clicking] ‐ Oh, my God. Yes! Yes, I will see you soon. Call me, okay? WOMAN: Thank you. KAT: Say hi to Alberto. WOMAN: Bye. KAT: Bye. [door closes] [sighs heavily] Oh, fuck. [exhales forcefully] Hi, Rob. ‐ Hey, Kat. ‐ What? ‐ That was quite the production. ‐ Oh, my God, I know. I mean, it's, it's all a bit ridiculous, but, you know, it's opening doors... and the sponsorship pays. Plus these Soju dudes were just... so eager. I just felt bad for them, you know? You were great, by the way. ‐ Yeah, so, Kat, why'd you leave me for Caitlin? ‐ Oh, my God. Fuck! I fuckin' knew it! I fuckin' knew, motherfucker. I knew that you were going through one of those "what‐does‐it‐all‐mean?" things! I fuckin' knew it, I'm telling you. Shit! ‐ I am. I am. Very much so. It's okay, I can take it. Look. I mean, of course I thought that you were charming and thoughtful. And I just, I adored the way that you just got consumed by all of the things that you loved. But I just felt that I was... dragging you a bit? And Caitlin was less hard work? Like, a little bit sunnier. Sparkier. Like, a little bit more... sure of herself? ‐ Okay. All right. Thank you, that's really helpful. ‐ And you just always seemed like, how do I put this, in search of yourself? Like, looking for constant purpose and validation? ‐ Is that it? ‐ You could also be a bit obsessive, like, um, a little too in touch with your feelings. ‐ Okay. ‐ I hope it's not hurtful. You seem like you're doing great now, if it's, you know... any consolation. Oh, fuck. We gotta go. I need to be out by 10 or I'm screwed. ‐ What do you mean? ‐ Oh, my God. You thought that I live here? Fuck, you're funny. Honey, this is an events rental. Come on. Let's go. Chop‐chop. ‐ Oh, shit. Da‐da‐da‐da‐da! Read it to me! Okay. "Front woman looking for a band.

Thank you. ‐ You know, it's weird and stupid. ‐ I'm glad you finally realized that. ‐ Although‐‐ ‐ Fuck me! ‐ Why should I care what a person like that thinks about me, anyway? ‐ Exactly. ‐ You should not. ‐ She sucks. ‐ She sucks. ‐ I should want... to be rejected by someone like that. ‐ How the fuck did you get from that to this? ‐ What kind of mentality is that? No. ROB: Yes. Yes. Yes! CHERISE: Are you serious? ‐ Oh, my God. Freedom! The lessons. The lessons. This idea is so fuckin' baller. ‐ You're gonna end up with your ex's ballers on your face, if you keep up with this list shit, all right? Now, you gonna sit here and lie to me and tell me you ain't fucked none of them exes? ‐ No. This is about the truth, Cherise. SIMON: Exactly. Which is why you need to quit while you're ahead. ‐ What do you mean? ‐ Just stop. Quit before you get to the one that broke your heart. ‐ Mac is next. SIMON: Yeah. Just don't do it. ‐ Nope.

Um, yeah, I was, uh, I was just over at the bar with Simon and Cherise, and we were talking and I was gonna walk home and then I remembered that you live near here now, so I thought, um, maybe I would stop‐‐ ‐ Rob. ROB: Yeah? ‐ Do you want to come up for a sec? ‐ Yeah. That'd be great. ‐ You want a drink? ‐ Uh, yeah. ‐ I think I've got some of that tea you like. ‐ Maybe something stronger. ‐ Yeah.

I've been listening. ‐ Oh, yeah? ‐ Yeah. ‐ In order? ‐ Do you think I'm a crazy person? I learned my lesson many moons ago, Rob: thou shalt not shuffle the lady's playlists. ‐ I'm just saying it's like that for a reason. There's a story there, man. ‐ Oh, I get it. It's good to see you, Rob. ‐ Yeah, you too. ‐ I'm sorry we never really talked after everything went down, you know. ‐ Yeah. Me too. The whole "moving across the Atlantic" thing didn't really give me a "let's talk about it" vibe. So‐‐ ‐ Yeah, well.
