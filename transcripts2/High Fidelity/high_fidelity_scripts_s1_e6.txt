 Saturdays at the store are actually pretty great. It's busy, the vibe is strong. We get a pretty reasonable cross-section of the city's phonograph-owning public, but I can always spot the real addicts, the ones who just can't leave without buying a record, like this guy over here. He's been making a list of possible purchases in his head. "If I don't find something in the next five minutes, this random blues compilation will have to do" Good choice.

 Yeah. I guess. Fetish properties are not unlike porn. I'd feel bad taking their money, if I wasn't, well, kinda one of them. There you go, man. You're fuckin' killing me. Like, like, no disrespect, but where have you been your entire life. How do you not own Stop Making Sense? That's crazy. That's like not owning Blonde or fucking Blonde on Blonde, you know what I'm sayin'? Uh... Damn, man, let me get you right. You got some Fleetwood Mac. One of those. Let's see what else.

 Ohhh, shit! Paul's Boutique, motherfucker. All right. Now, I have taken you on this journey, and I think you done some fine-ass work. No, no, no, thank me later.

I did that thing where, like, you order enough Chinese that they send four chopsticks. But you're like, it's just me. You're making me feel worse. Umm... and I'm re-watching The Sopranos. - So, yeah. - Ugh, you know I haven't... I haven't seen it yet. What do you mean yet? It's been out for, like, 25 years. I was... No, I missed it. I just didn't do it. Sure. Did you grow up in a bunker? - Yes. Yeah. - Oh. My family was in a cult. Very cool. Unfortunately, I'm not really into Kool-Aid. - Like, not my drink. - Right. Sure. That makes sense. Yeah, I'm gonna watch it though. I'm gonna get on it. I mean, I'm a little taken aback. For starters. Mostly, I'm just, like, genuinely excited for you though to start on this journey, because it's so good that I wish I could go back and see it for the first time. - Cool. - Yeah. - I'll watch it. - And when you get to the end, uh, give me a call, we'll go get some Italian, and we'll just talk it all out. - All right. Deal. - All right. Deal. Wow! Man, you literally read my mind. I've always wished that Sly were more like Fela, but still like Sly, you know? I do. That's Onyeabor. Game-changer. Hey, excuse me. Hey. Looks like you just rocked that guy's world. No, I just showed him a record. Any idea what I might like? I don't... I mean, everybody's tastes are so... different. I... You know, some people like some stuff. Other people like other stuff, so, you know, it's tough. People really still listen to tapes, huh? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do. I like them. They're weird but warm. Weird but warm. Yeah. I, I feel that. Well, if you think of anything I might like, come by the coffee shop? - When, when are you there? - I'm there most days of the week. Okay. Yeah, I'll... Sure. Yeah. So what? You just came by to give me shit for not having seen The Sopranos or what? Yeah. Mission accomplished. No, I just came to say hi. Is that allowed? I'll allow it. Good. Hi. Hi. Hi. - Hi. - I, I gotta... Yes. No, you gotta work. Yep. Enjoy. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Hey, yo, Rob. - Hmm? Who the fuck was that dude in the khakis? What dude in khakis? "What dude in kha..." The dude that you was eye-fucking for the last 10 minutes, that dude. I wasn't eye-fucking anyone. You were eye-fucking him. He wasn't ev... First of all, he wasn't wearing khakis. He's my friend Clyde. All right. Clyde. Okay. I knew that sounded familiar. Clyde-that-owns-a-car Clyde. - Prius Clyde. - Yes. Exactly. The Clyde that drove you uptown to go check out some overpriced record collection, that Clyde? - Yes. - Cla-Cla-Clyde-Clyde-Clyde-Clyde! Yes, that Clyde. Yes. He is a patron of the store now. Guys, employees, for the love of God, I beg of you, go back to work. What the fuck? Jesus, Rob. So you talk to a white dude in khakis for all of five fuckin' seconds and now you all business all the time. It's okay. I see you, and I got you. Everyone, let's get back to business, all right! Sundays are a little bit more lax. I guess everybody's at brunch. Or yoga or laundry or whatever other adult activities make them feel less shitty about their stupid life choices. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Bro, there's 46. Can you please write down 46. It's not. It's not 46. Ramones' Singles Box counts as ten, not one. Rob, could you please remind Mr. Florida Recount over here that box sets count as multiple records? - Rob. - Hmm? Hmm? What? Come on, Yo. What the fuck? Like, we havin' a conversation. What are you doing on your phone? Who you texting? - No one. - "No one" is "someone." Who is it? Okay, who is it, Rob? Is it fucking Khaki Clyde? Y'all about to throw a little fuckin' sweater party? - That's what y'all doing? - It's, uh, it's Liam actually. Wait a motherfucking minute. Rewind. What, what you got? What is happening? Nothing. We text sometimes. He's back from tour. He wants to hang. Yeah, he's actually kinda blowing up right now. - Yeah? - He invited me to his show tomorrow night. You mean his sold-out show at Brooklyn Steel? - Mm-hmm. - Yo, for real. Shit, I just get so hyped when my people are just, they just making shit happen, and they're doing shit for themselves. Let me tell y'all right now, when my shit pops off, oooh, it's gonna be lit! You know you have to actually make music to sell out a music venue, right? And you know the dude that you like is, like, 12, right? Can you just do some work please. Sure thing, Mr. Polanski. That's great. That's very helpful. - I know you would like that. - Yeah, I know, I love it. You wanna come with me tomorrow night? I got backstage passes. Sure. Before you even ask, I would be honored to be your plus two. What is that face? All right. Yeah, let me see what I can do. I'm fucking honored! Whoo! We going to the show! We're gonna hang backstage! We're gonna drink with the band! We're gonna watch from the side! Lewis and I actually got to see TV On The Radio once from side stage 'cause his roommate's girl... someone was sleeping with one of the guys in the sound system. Whatever. - So what? - And it's actually the worst place to hear a show. That is bullshit and you know it. All right. You're in. Oh! Oh, my God, Rob. Thank you so much. Yo, but I have to ask you a question. Serious. If I accompany you to the playground, does that make me an accomplice? Cherise, the door! Oh, fuck, no! Motherfuckin' bitches! My bad. My bad. My bad. Fuck! They can really run. They're gone. They're fast. No fuckin' way. What is it? What's wrong? - Look at this? - Shit. This is them. These dumb motherfuckin' bitches. Yo, if you... if you trying to steal some shit, you don't fuckin' put your address and a fuckin' photo of yourself at the motherfuckin' scene of the crime. - Oh, shit. - I gotta, I gotta quit smoking. ♪ There's nothin' for us in Belfast ♪ ♪ The Pound's old and that's a pity ♪ ♪ Okay so there's the Trident in Bangor ♪ ♪ And then you walk back to the city ♪ Hey, what's up? ♪ They don't even know you know ♪ ♪ They just want money we can take it or leave it ♪ ♪ What we need ♪ ♪ Is an alternative Ulster ♪ ♪ Grab it and change it, it's yours ♪ This is a terrible idea. They're gonna fuckin' shank us. Shank you? Who says that? Nah. You got this. All right. Now repeat after me: I'm a motherfuckin' G, and I can do this shit. I'm not saying that shit. Listen. The shit works. Just say it. You're so mean. I'm a motherfuckin' G, - and I can do this shit. - All right, shut up, let's just do it. Listen. Yep, hear it. All right, genius, what's your plan? Yeah, that's right. We found your motherfuckin' bitch asses. Aw, shit! Look, apologies, genuinely. We're just borrowing them. We were gonna bring them back. Borrowing them? We're not a fuckin' Blockbuster. What's a "Blockbuster"? - Never mind, Peachy. - I'm Shane. Whatever. Why are you guys "borrowing" records from my shop, huh? We make our own samples. We can't afford to buy them. - Then sample shit online. - Vinyl sounds better. Joni Mitchell, King Crimson. - Mm, mm, mm. - Alice Coltrane... You have good taste. Yeah, we know. - All right. You got one day. - What? Finish whatever you're doing and bring 'em back, okay? - Bro, have you lost your mother... - Cherise, shut up a second. I want them back in pristine condition by noon tomorrow. - Oh, my... - Shut up! Or I call the cops. Deal? Deal. - What the fuck? - Can... - I'm sorry about her. - Fuck it! All right. Yo, what happened to you? Did you panic? Like, who was that? That's why we had a script. Jesus! Well, now I know you're not a boss. The fuck. You know, Cherise, every once in a while, it would be useful for you to admit you have no idea what you're talking about. Who are you talking to? I have no idea? Am I the one that just went and gave free records to fuckin' Fisher-Price Cool & Dre back there? You know, just go back to the shop and help Simon close up, okay. Sweetie, where are you going? Liam invited me to the studio. I mean, he's a cute toddler and all, but you don't have to leave me. Come on! Stop. I'm scared. All my life I've wanted to date a musician. Not just someone in a band, but, you know, a real musician. He'd write songs at home, maybe include one of our private jokes in the lyrics. Thank me in the liner notes.

But you have it, and, uh, just have fun. Wait. You wanna get weird with it? Did she do it? Did she go to bed with an actual real-life rock star ten years her junior? Yes, kids. Yes, she did. I'm not gonna go into the whole, you know, who-did-what-to-who-stuff because... I'm a lady. You know that song Behind Closed Doors by Charlie Rich? I love that song. I can say we had a good time. I can say that. And I didn't totally embarrass myself. Hey, you leaving? Hey. Uh, yeah, you know, I was gonna get out of your... get out of your hair and gotta go to, uh... work. So... These are yours. Sorry. You, uh, you got time for a coffee? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Okay. Coffee. So, you excited for your show tonight? Hmm. Yeah, I am. I mean, I am quite bummed, you know, that I have to leave straight after. Be nice to stick about and celebrate with my friends and, you know, hang out with you. Very sweet. Very good coffee. Thank you. - Where's your tour? - South America. So we're doing Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil. Yeah. So, I mean, yeah, it'll be sick. Oh, and we're doing Mexico City as well. Mexico. Big fan. I'm just kidding. I've never been to Mexico. You should come to Mexico City! Yeah, okay. You should. You totally should. I mean, why not? You know the whole thing about being a rock star is you get to sleep with girls and not call them back, right? You don't have to invite me to Mexico, dude. Wow, I didn't know you were a misogynist. But really though, I mean, you should come. Can I think about it? Uh... yeah. You can think about it. Cool. So what time, what time do you start work, again? You really are 19. Teenagers. A typical Monday morning consists of bacon, egg and cheese, self-pity, and shitty bodega coffee. That was not a typical Monday morning. That's more like it. Damn it. Shit.

Yeah, so what? They're good. I'm sorry, I just find it kind of odd, you know, that you would prefer to rep some fuckin' trust fund punks over someone who you know in your bitter, jealous heart is a musical visionary. Well, where's the record, Cherise? I don't know how many times I have to tell you I am operating on the element of surprise! What are you, Beyoncé? You're not making shit. No, I'm not. I'm the motherfuckin' underdog, Rob! You should know this. You know what? I'm taking a sick day! Take it! You don't do shit here anyway. - Fuck you, yo. - Fuck you, yo. What the fuck was that? Hey. Yo, I'm ready. I just want to stop by my place real fast so I can change. Where the fuck are my keys? Actually, do you mind if I, um, skip it? You're kidding. You're gonna make me go to the show alone. You're not gonna be alone. There's gonna be, like, a thousand people there. Plus Mr. Future of Music, Liam Shawcross, - Scottish hot boy... - Uh-huh. Cool. Great. - Don't be like that. - Yeah. Everybody sucks today. No, we don't. We're not, uh... ♪ You take the skyway ♪ ♪ High above the busy little one-way ♪ ♪ In my stupid hat and gloves at night I lie awake ♪ ♪ Wonderin' if I'll sleep ♪ ♪ Wonderin' if we'll meet out in the street ♪ ♪ But you take the skyway ♪ - 'Sup. - 'Sup.

Yeah, I mean, that's probably why it doesn't feel real. But, yeah, this is cool. So, um... I thought about it. And Mexico, I'm in. Ah, shit. - What? - Um, yeah, we're actually, um... we're not doing Mexico City anymore. - Oh. - Yeah, we, uh, we booked Glastonbury. - What? - Yeah. - Glastonbury. - Yeah. - Holy shit, dude, that's huge. - Yeah. - Congratulations. - Thank you.

So, I mean, we won't have much time to hang 'cause we're only there for, like, 24 hours. But I will get back to New York! Soon. - After the tour. - Cool. So that'll be, like, like, a couple months. - Cool. - I'm sorry. I mean, things are... it's just crazy. It's totally fine. I get it. I understand. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. - I've gotta go. - Yeah. Go. - Go. - All right. - I'll see you after, yeah? - Mm-hmm. You know I sing too, right? I do now. My shit's like, uh, punk soul, you know what I'm saying? But high concept, only the best. You know what I mean? But it's actually, ahh, I don't know, it's, it's a little less punk. You know what I mean? Um, it's a little less punk, but it's still commercial. It's that new-new shit, that new-new shit that nobody got. I got it. You know what I'm saying? Fuck, it's hard to describe it, you know what I mean? Like, how the fuck do you describe genres, I don't know. But, um, uh, yeah, so, you should, uh, you should hear me sing. That's what we should just do. Maybe you should just hear me sing and, and, and you enjoy yourself, you know what I'm saying? So let's figure out when you have some time in your little... Hey, you know what, I...
