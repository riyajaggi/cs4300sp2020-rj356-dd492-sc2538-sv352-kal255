They've been together for over a year. ‐ Over a year? ‐ Are you gonna buy those records from me or what? ‐ We just broke up 13 and a half months ago. ‐ Okay. Well, that's you not overthinking things. ‐ Jesus. And you're, you're just telling me this now? Jesus Christ, whose side are you on? What the fuck? ‐ Whoa!

Kevin Bannister. ‐ Bannister. Yes. You guys "went out" for like a minute and a half. And then you broke up, and you spent, like, the whole summer just listening to The Cure and, like, drawing skulls in your bedroom. ‐ So? ‐ So? That was the seventh grade, and you're still doing the exact same thing right now. ‐ Am not! ‐ Are too! You're with someone, and then it ends, and then you just, you, you freak out and shut down and spend, like, the next five years just spinning your wheels and muttering to yourself about "what went wrong?" ‐ That's called "dating." ‐ Is it? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Is it? Never mind, then. ‐ [mockingly] Never mind. ‐ You never mind. ‐ You‐‐ ‐ What you want for the poster? [Rob sighs heavily] ‐ Call it even. ‐ Dope. ‐ Look, it's fine, all right. I'm not an idiot. It was bound to happen at some point. Mac has a new girlfriend. See? I'm fine. It's fine. It's not like they're married. What? What? ‐ I don't know, I heard he got a ring, okay. Can I have my poster?

You just, you gotta find your people. ‐ Yes. Exactly. Problem is, I'm kind of on a different level, you know? ‐ You gotta trust. ‐ Yeah. You know, like Courtney Love. Courtney Love, she was 25, she was like a total punk, you know? ‐ Yeah. ‐ So she put up an ad. She said, "I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, Fleetwood Mac." ‐ That's it? ‐ That's it. That's how she started Hole. She just pointed a flare gun up into the universe and the universe answered. ‐ Well, I really like that. So, basically what you're saying is, you just gotta put it out there, and then they'll eventually come to you? Yeah. Yo, that's some real heavy shit. [Liam laughs] SIMON: Hey. ‐ Hey. Hey. Sorry I missed the show. ‐ It's all good. These guys say that you always show up eventually. ‐ Did they? Did they? ‐ Right. Anyone fancy a game of Chase The Dragon?

You wouldn't even be familiar with my immediate influences. ‐ I mean, try me. ‐ They're mostly French. ♪ I'm lookin' up ♪ ‐ Oh! ♪ Everything's... ♪ ROB: Okay. Maybe Cameron was right. I needed a distraction. And as far as distractions go, could be worse. So, if Simon's theory is true, that it's not what you're like but what you like that matters, then Liam and I are Exhibit A. We bond over books, TV, music, movies. We express our shared opinions on Joan Didion, J Dilla, dubstep, Escape from New York, sports, Mexican food: yes, yes, no, yes, no, and yes. ‐ I gotta go home. I'm done. ‐ Okay. [police siren wailing] ‐ The cops are after me. They're coming. ROB: They're coming. ‐ I gotta go. ‐ Don't shoot. SIMON: Bye, guys ‐ Yo, okay, I gotta tell you the truth.

And I just don't get how he can want that, you know, like, if he wanted that, I don't get how he was ever with me. Did it not work because I wasn't what he wanted? Or did he change what he wanted because... of what I am? You know, it's like, it's like, you're with someone, right? And... you're like one person, you become a part of them, and then you're not with them, and they become like this fuckin' stranger. You know? And I just don't get it. I don't get... how we get from there to here. And it just makes me think I know nothing. I know none of the answers to... any of the questions. And that's me not talking about that anymore. So, um... how long ago was Jenny? ‐ Jenny? ‐ Hmm. Jenny. ‐ Um, we broke up last spring. ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ So... like, a year? Yeah. A year. Wow. Graduation. ‐ Hmm. ‐ College graduate, very impressive.
