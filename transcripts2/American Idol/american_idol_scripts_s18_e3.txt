He's written a lot of great stuff "Two Piña Coladas" for Garth Brooks, "How Long Gone" for Brooks & Dunn... That's exactly right. ..."Would You Go With Me" for Josh Turner and... Okay, but what about you? Well, I grew up singing gospel music in church, and, uh, I was, uh, raised and adopted by my grandparents. Nana and Papaw were really encouraging of my my desire to do music. I grew up in Lewisville, Ohio. It was a very small, little farm community. Whenever I was little, I knew I wanted to be a songwriter. Oh, Nana! There you go! There, you got it! My nana and papaw knew that I wanted to move to Nashville to do music and be a songwriter. ♪ Call it dumb luck ♪ They said, "Well, we'll move to Nashville with you, but you got to get a degree first." I went to nursing school in Ohio and and I got my first nursing job when we moved to Nashville. Discharging tomorrow, maybe? Hopefully. I love my work as a nurse, and everything I do, I want it to help people and inspire people, and and I've gotten a lot of inspiration from my nursing career for my music, so it's taught me a lot. My biggest fan when it comes to my music is definitely Nana. Um, but maybe closely ties with Shawn. They're both, like, my number‐one fans. ♪ When the bones are good, the rest don't matter ♪ How you feeling? I'm feeling alright. Well, you're the best I ever heard, so I believe you're gonna knock it out of the park. He's such an incredible musician, and Shawn is very much Nana‐approved. I told Shawn my maid of honor is gonna have to be Nana. Just go out there and be yourself. Thank you, baby. Having Shawn in the room with me I know will ease the tension a little bit. The mission is to make it to Hollywood and Nana's gonna go to Hollywood. Very good.  Well, good deal. Let's hear it. Let's hear it. Uh, this is a song I wrote with a friend of mine, Renée Martin. It's called "If I Can Lose You." ♪ I love you so much ♪ ♪ But I'm so afraid ♪ ♪ Lately, I feel like you're pullin' away ♪ ♪ I give and I give, but all you ever do ♪ ♪ Is take ♪ ♪ And if you can leave me ♪ ♪ That's how it should be ♪ ♪ If you can stand to let go of my hand ♪ ♪ Then just walk away ♪ ♪ I want to love you ♪ ♪ Like nobody's loved you ♪ ♪ But if I can lose you ♪ ♪ I think I need to ♪ Wow. Great song. Great song, you guys. Thank you. That was very moving. I love the feeling and emotion in your voice. Thank you. Mm. I'm a sucker for a good songwriter. I think what I love the most is that you have this silky quality of a storyteller, and that's the part I‐I really fell in love with. Thank you. You know, we had Laci Kaye Booth last year... Right, right, right. ...who was kind of smoky and... Right. But she even had a little bit lower voice than you did. Yeah. But she did so well because it was so... her thing. Authentic. Yeah. Like I said, are you gonna go stand beside some Kelly Clarkson belter? No, but are you gonna be able to walk out there and really hold a room with your style? Potentially yes. Best storyteller wins. Yes. That's true. So... Bang. Right there. ...if you tell a story and we believe you through and through, we're gonna subscribe. Yeah, we will be butter. Thank you. We will melt. You know? Yes. Make us melt. Let's take a vote. Let's take a vote. I'm a big‐time yes. Aww. I'm a yes. And And I've melted already. And I'm a yes for sure so... Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You going to Hollywood, sweetheart. Come on. Thank you so much! Alright! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Aww! Thank you so much. Congrats. God bless you. Hollywood! It's gonna be really real. You got it. We're gonna put her through it, so keep the line open. That's okay. I'm country. I'm tough. I can take it. You can. I see those boots. Thank y'all. Take care. There's some good news. Congratulations! Thank you so much! It means everything to be able to go home and bring back this golden ticket to my nana and my papaw. They have sacrificed so much for me to be able to do music. I know they're gonna be super excited, and, uh, I‐I'm just I can't wait to tell them. ♪ Thank God that my life's already good ♪ Hello, and welcome to another episode of "Country Fried," bringing you the best country‐music conversations. My name's Ryan Harmon, and it is my pleasure to be able to bring arguably the king of Nashville to the show, Mr. Bobby Bones. And very arguably. Very, very arguably. I‐I know we have a limited time here, but I really want to get into where you are and how you got there. I grew up in a small town called Mountain Pine, Arkansas. At 5 years old, they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up and my grandmother saved it and I said I wanted to be a comedian, a radio host, and I wanted to be in a band. Um, from an early age, I'd kind of set my goals to get out of the situation that I grew up in. And it wasn't the best home situation, so that was kind of the path out. Kind of changing subjects here. This is all hypothetical. Okay, go ahead. So, say that I knew somebody who was auditioning for "American Idol"? Mm‐hmm. Hypothetical, what would they need to know before they go in there? Before you walk in the room, you know, you got to come to the realization that you deserve to be here. Maybe you get the golden ticket, maybe you don't. Maybe you learn something from the experience that takes you down a different path. But before you walk in, you got to know that you have earned your spot to be here today. I appreciate that. That's why I'll say hypothetically. Hypo‐‐ I know we got a little specifically hypothetical. Hypothetically. But hypothetically. Welcome to "American Idol." Hey. On a scale of 9 to 10, how do I look?

That's how we do it in Arkansas. What can I say? Aw, I love it. Oh, my gosh. You have a little whistle, too. Perfection takes time. I just... Can you say "shooey"? Shooey! That is like... There you go. That needs to be a ringtone. Now, if my voice gets blown out after that, can I blame it on you or...? You were born to say "shooey." I'm sure you got a million "shooeys" in you there. I got plenty. Well, tell us who you are, where you're from. I'm Ryan Harmon, 24 years old, from Lamar by golly Arkansas, and just tickled to be here. "Back alley" Arkansas? "By golly, Arkansas."

And I focused on a real job and didn't really give myself a chance. Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm. Whether I fell flat on my face or not, just to at least not go out of this world wondering, "Well, what if?" Yeah. Well, you're 24, and when I was 24, I had a real job. Right. And then, when I turned 25, I got tired of having a real job and moved to Nashville. To be writing good‐quality songs by yourself down in Arkansas is a tough thing to do. In Nashville, the competition will up your game. I think you ought to really consider that one day. Your voice is pretty dang good. Thank you. I‐I just trying to wrap my head around, "Is it 'American Idol' stuff?" Right. Ryan, I think you have something to build on. You have a great voice.

I was walking down the street, and Courtney was at the corner, and she was sitting there, and she looked very sad, and I said, "What's going on?" She said, "Well, I showed up to audition, but I think I missed the deadline. But this is my dream, and I've wanted to do this all my life." And so I grabbed her and brought her up the elevator. I've been sitting out here since, uh, 8:00 this morning. 8:00 this morning? Mm‐hmm. Just sitting all day. Really? Yeah. I was gonna wait for, like, however long it took. Like, I do not care. Oh, so you're literally just waiting for everybody to leave? Yeah. I was over there, and then I was over there. Then I was over here. The problem is, the producers have started the auditions with the judges... Right. ...and I don't know if they're signing anybody else up. Right. That's the problem. Mm. Okay. But the solution to that problem is me just taking you up there and seeing if they let you go. Okay. I can't I can't promise you, 'cause I haven't asked them, but... Sure.

Which is my better side? This side? Right? This side? ♪ I'm the man ♪ I want to show people I'm more than just a s‐‐ a photo.

My name is Isaiah Grass. It is wonderful to meet you guys. How have you kept that outfit white all day? Actually, fun fact. I have never worn this jacket before. When I first auditioned, this black material right here, it actually all ripped off, so my manager actually sewed everything back on. Manager? You're kidding. You have a manager? Well, actually manager/agent/best friend. The "best friend" thing will fade. When there's money involved... Aw, you know, I just love this wonderful optimistic group I'm with. First of all, where you are from? Tell us the whole thing, your story. Sure. Absolutely. So I was born in North Carolina, raised in South Carolina, and I've been living in Chicago now for about seven years. Ah. I sang in a church choir. I graduated from a performing‐arts high school. Ahh. And I'm also a model, a singer, and a social‐media influencer. Wow. Very good. What do you influence on social media? Well, I have different brands that reach out to me, so Really? I have companies that provide me shoes. I have people that send me jackets and necklaces, and I've actually been paid actually to endorse drinks. You have a full life, my friend.

It's true, you can sing. I think that you are more of a musical‐theater star than possibly an "American Idol" star. I think you've got the goods to be on Broadway and musical theater.

What is it that you guys are looking for? No, no, no. No, no. You have an amazing delivery package, okay? Thank you. I think you just need an arena that capitalizes on your talents of all of your range, because this is "American Idol," the pop version of the world of music. Sure, of course. And so it's it's going to have to stay in that region. Let's vote, guys. I'm sorry. It's a no for me. I think your stage is a theatrical stage, so it's a no for me, Isaiah. Okay. You mesmerized me. You brought me right into your story. It's That's what being an artist is all about. I understand. When you guys perform, you know that's what it's about. I agree with you, and I'm probably gonna regret this in times going on, but, for now, it's gonna be a no for me. Okay. Thank you, Isaiah. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you very, very much. I hope if I ever get the opportunity again to meet you guys... Yeah. ...that I get to sing for you again. Thank you so much. Very good. Thank you.
