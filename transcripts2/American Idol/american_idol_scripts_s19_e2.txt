When I was 11, my parents decided to grab two suitcases, leave everything, and move into the tent. ♪♪ They did it to get closer to our Hawaiian heritage and to get closer as a family. We lived off the land. I actually raised a baby goat named Stripey. That's when we discovered that we could write music, 'cause we love writing music. How many months apart are you?

Like, how many people get to say that they used the bathroom in the air? I smell cow crap. But in a good way. It reminds me of home. I never thought I'd be on a camera on TV. This is weird. The bright lights are bright. Going to sing in front of, like, celebrity famous people? I know. How are you feeling about that? Oh, God. Oh, my gosh, I get it all the time. Every time I go get my hair done, "Wow, she looks like Katy Perry." Maybe it's the eyeballs, 'cause we both got blue ones and they're big. I never exactly saw little ol' me getting to do something like this, you know. "American Idol." Let's get 'er done. ♪ If your eyes are on me ♪ What's up? How y'all doing? ♪ You're lookin' at country ♪ Just sitting around. Yeah, I've been waiting too long. I'm ready to get this thing done. Oh, wait. I just love that twang in your voice.

But I'm going to do all I can to push you to the next level, not for me, not for "American Idol," but for yourself, because you owe it to yourself to really be pushed... Yes, sir... and dig in. You have an attitude problem. In a good way? I think I've been pretty respectful. And I like it. Okay. But you are no longer allowed to play it safe. Yes, ma'am. You better start rolling the dice on your life. Yes, ma'am. Listen to me. On every note you hit, at the end of that, I can hear you go, "Eh, whatever." You're going to have competition that they know what they're going to sing, they know what they're going to curl on, and they've already set up the next line. And on top of that, they're entertaining. They're not doing this. Come get us, because you're sitting on a gold mine. Listen, there's some we can save. You got it. Yes, sir. Thank you. Okay?

I'm 26 years old, and I'm from the Delta of Mississippi. Coming up in Marks, we didn't have too many opportunities. Got this. And whenever you have a community like that with no jobs, no education opportunities, it'll lead a child down the wrong path, and it'll turn a person to a person that he would never want to be. Being incarcerated, it really took a lot away from me. CJ, where you at, baby? Time to get you ready for school. To be away from my child and my family ‐‐ I can't get them days back. Want you to have a good day at school today, alright? Okay. Come here, give me a hug before you go. You can't get it back. I love you, Junior. Love you, too. Mwah! I got down on my knees and I asked God to please help me and guide me down the right path to be able to make it back home to my family. Sometimes life can get hard. But what you overcome is what you make out of it. I don't want you to get discouraged about your past, man. There's nothing you can do to change what happened in the past. All you need to do is look forward. Stay forward. You got it, man. Alright, be safe. Yes, sir. Lord, right now, Lord, you are the one that will be able to bless me and uplift me to become a better man than I am. Guide me. Lead me. Oh, my God. This is heavy. You got to be strong.

I get first ball. No, you don't. Yes, I do. No. We on the way. You made it for real. Yeah, I got to make it. I have to be the one to make decisions on what I want to be in life, but if I continue to stay focused, I'll continue to grow. Clearly, you've made a change in your life to get on a different track. That's why you're sitting right here. I knew that I had to change my life at some point because I have a young man that is 8 years old. And I knew one thing ‐‐ If I didn't change my life around, he was gonna go down the same path. It's not every day a person get to live their dream. You living yours, and we're proud of you. We love you, son. I love y'all, too. Whatever we want out of life, if we strive for better and push it and push it and push it, we will achieve our dream. So this audition means... A lot, the world. ...a lot to you. That's pretty serious. What are you gonna do for us, man? Today I'm gonna sing something by Calvin Richardson. Calvin Richardson. "Falling Out of Love." Wow.

Sounds like you've been through some stuff. ♪♪ ♪♪ What you're carrying on your shoulders is ‐‐ I can't even imagine. Listen, Calvin, today is a new day. Okay? Calvin: Yes, ma'am. Don't forget that. Calvin, let me tell you something. Very few times in this jaded world we live in something comes along and just stops the show. Man, there is a small percentage of people that can walk out on "American Idol," start singing from their soul, and it's right on the money. What you did was very, very brave to open up to us like that. Yes, sir. God started you at this point with us, and we're gonna go forward with you. You understand me? Yes, sir. And no matter how far it takes you, it's gonna be better than where you ever started in life. You have my word on that, okay? Yes, sir. Guys, let's vote. Luke, what are you thinking? Yes.

I'm 15 years old, and I'm from Estero, Florida. I come from a really small town, and there's nothing there for me musically. So I have no experience performing. Most people here seem to have lots of performing experience. I'm, like, kind of intimidated. The only places I sing are literally my bathroom. I put my song on, pick up my brush, and then I just go for it. Like, in the mirror, I just literally pretend I'm onstage. Auditioning for "American Idol" means everything to me.

Most of the people that know that I love to sing are my friends. That's pretty much it. Well, who do you listen to? I listen to Nirvana. Oh. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublime. And then I love blues like Ella Fitzgerald. Wow. Yeah. I love rock, though. Well, what are you gonna do for us today? I'm gonna be singing "Live Wire" by Motley Crue. Wow. Okay. Alright. Give it to us. I don't think we've ever heard that song on this show. We've not heard this. This is the first. That means we're gonna be paying attention. And you're gonna do it a cappella? Okay.

And that's what your audition was for me. Thank you so much. I wrote "top 10 def" on the Motley Crue song, and then you just did what ‐‐ I don't even know what the heck just happened just then. Thank you so much. Okay, so you're 15. It's obviously not your first time on this planet, but maybe this time you will fulfill your purpose. Not her first time. Mm, yeah. You're really, really, really good. And I love that nobody knows that you can sing besides you and a couple of your friends and your hairbrush, probably. Yeah.
