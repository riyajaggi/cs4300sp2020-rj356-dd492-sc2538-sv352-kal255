 There's a source - on their Third Floor. - Strategy. They say he's been feeding Pope for years now. - You trust this man's intelligence? - He has never been wrong. If Shadow is real, everything is compromised. - They created a vacancy. - A high-traffic position. Director level. Found your little stash. Thanks for the intel. You know, we could help each other. The Office are watching me, but they're not watching you. What about Ian?

 Stay the fuck away from her. I'm sorry. About what happened to your other. I care about you, and I would never let anyone hurt you. You're moving pouches for Lambert? To a specific location? I need the address, Edgar. A mansion. Potsdam. ♪ Hey! Okay? Ah... Okay, okay.

 ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Customs. Why does it always break down at Customs? Prince's best work in years. But you do know he's no longer alive over there, right? Now, what do you think would happen if this fucking album were to find its way across? Ian, please... We are tasked with safeguarding the most important fucking secret in the history of mankind. I'm broke. My kid is sick. Oh, Jovey. You think I care about your family? Here's the code. Don't, please! Fuck up the code, you get fucked up. Yeah? Do you remember Edgar Brandt? That embassy courier we had on a wiretap. He was talking too much to his girlfriends. Yeah, what about him? Heard him make a call tonight, crying about getting shaken down by Emily for some address. - Address? - She was with Howard Silk. What do you want to do with them? Black room. Three months. No, Ian! Please don't do this! ♪ ♪ He doesn't show up. I cannot work like this. He comes and goes as he pleases. This is unacceptable. Director, are you listening? He-he has not been in for days. - Who? - Howard Silk. It was my impression you were sending someone to lighten my load. - Should I be drafting a complaint? - What? Should I be drafting a complaint about Howard Silk? No, no, don't, no. I'll, um... I'll take care of it. Thank you. - I'm going out. - What about your 2:00? Oh, you're alive. Sorry, I wasn't sure. I've been busy. How's your internal search going? Brilliantly well. There's a mole in Strategy. It's official. We confirmed it with a source. Yeah, no shit. Do you know what section? No, Aldrich's looking into it now. And if you don't start coming into work, he's gonna start looking at you, too. Is that what you want? What's this? This is what Emily was working on. Stolen internal documents, taken from your office, passed to the outside. - This is my floor code. - Yes, it is. These documents were stolen from my department? Yes. As I said, you have a mole. And when were you planning on showing me these? How about right now? And what about Baldwin? We will find Baldwin. This is more important. You find out who those came from, I'm gonna keep going through all this. I'll be at the Walcot Hotel. Not spending another minute in that office. You know it's my birthday today? Supposed to be hosting a dinner party tonight. Friends, colleagues. Who knows? Probably inviting this mole into my house. Yeah. Look into those memos. Oh, don't you worry, I'm playing my part. Play yours. ♪ Ja. Ja. Best pudding in Berlin, don't you think? Roast the hazelnuts in-house. It's always the little things. Bit strange... seeing him with nothing pithy to say. Maybe he's having an off-day. Hear the good news, Howard? Lieber. Doctor says his knee won't need any pins. The limp he'll have to live with, but no more surgery. You never did apologize, did you? I don't think Howard's sorry for what he did. But don't take it personally. He's a world-class prick to everyone. You followed me here just to bust my balls? I want to talk about Edgar Brandt, the courier. Been on the phone whining about you and Em twisting his arm about some address. What are you two looking for? Maybe you should talk to her. No, Howard. It's about time you and me had a real chat. Ian said you're trying to go back to work. Well, you know what a shitty patient I am. No sugar, thank you. - Since when? - New study. High blood cholesterol levels. Sugar's the culprit. I'd inherit it from Dad. Well, that is the only thing you're gonna inherit from your dad. Has he been acting strange to you lately? Well... He did show some... natural concern for my well-being. Oh, fuck, Mom. When you finally decided to leave him, it was like any obligation I had to feel anything for him had lifted. And now... I can't believe I'm going to say this... But I'm worried about him. I went to see him yesterday. What did you talk about? Everything. I opened up, and he listened. He seemed actually interested in my life. Maybe he's trying to atone? You shouldn't put too much stock into that, you know. Mom, I promised myself a long time ago I was done giving him chances to disappoint me. Yeah. Keep that promise. Sooner or later, he will be back to his old self. Clare! How are you, Ingrid? Have you brightened your hair? Thank God for you. First person to notice. We'll be seeing you later? Oh, yes, sure. I can't wait. - Bye. - Bye. Act normal, or I snap your neck. Look at this place. Ten euro. So fucking expensive. - What do you want from me? - I finish the job. Then you pay me, and I disappear. - Nadia... - You do not get to call me that. You tried to have me killed. I had no choice. They put me in a corner. I'm sorry. Is this real? Your shopping and your house and your little family? - Why are you doing this? - To be free. You escaped. You are free. 100,000 euro... What you promised. I finish the contracts, you pay. Are you mad? They want you dead. They need me to finish. If I do, you'll get the money. Yeah. I pity you. Nothing you are is true. Early. Punctual. You seem nervous. Terrified. Howard, you remember Kaspar. Please keep movement to a minimum. It's now or never. No, thanks. Not hungry. You have no idea what you're missing. Read, uh, each card carefully. "Fred specialized in the job of making very quaint wax toys." Next card. "Five wine experts jokingly quizzed" - "sample Chablis." - Next. "Six big devils from Japan" quickly forgot how to waltz." Time for new pangrams, mate. We're ready. You know the drill, Howard. I'm going to ask questions. Starting back at the embassy. The hour you had with Emily... What did you two discuss after I left? I don't remember. Not in the mood to cook up a story? I just don't remember. Before she and I left, you told her to light a candle at St. Christopher's. It was a coded exchange. What did it mean? I don't know. May I have a word with you, please? Everything's steady. Not even a pupillary response. His defenses are getting better. Best he's ever been. I can't keep giving handouts. No. I can pay. Here. For the other day. Thank you for being kind. Yo, an espresso. Do you know where that is? Yeah. It's a beach in Croatia. Do you like it? I took it. I like it. Thank you. I'm Greta. Nadia. You're new to the city? Yes. Cash like that, you can go to any restaurant. Coffee is good here. No, it's not. What do you do while you're here? Nothing. Just work. And what do you do for fun? Well, if you like to hang out, there's this all-day party. You should check it out. It's fun. Is your name Lamar Jung? Sorry, do we know each other? I was a colleague of an old friend of yours. Walter Atwood. He was a director at my office. You knew Walter. Can we talk? Please, come in. I don't recall you being at Walter's funeral. He was private, as a married man. How well did you know him? Well enough to know. Well, at least we can dispel with the pretense. You know, you're the first of his colleagues who's ever come to me. Five years after he died. Why wait until now? He was 49 years old and died of a heart attack. - Right? - Yes. The stress of that job. I used to tell him he needed to slow down. Do you remember anything he was troubled by back then? It's been years. I mean... The usual pressures... He used to complain he was being pushed out of his position. Paranoia. He was always inferring he was being watched. - Watched? - Yeah. I just thought he was stressed. Do you remember when you last saw him? I was supposed to see him that day, Hotel Concorde. I was... sitting in that room, waiting. Walter was always the one to call. That was the arrangement. I didn't find out until the obituary, days later. Until then, I just thought it was his way of ending things. Are you saying we should be suspicious about Walter's death? No. I'm just tying up loose ends. ♪ I don't know how to do this. I know you give him these numbers so he can contact you when he's in trouble. I think you should come over. ♪ Thank you for letting me come in today. I realize you've been talking to Ian, but... I thought you should hear it from me. I confess that, uh, I have been having some personal difficulties lately. Yeah. I know. And, recently, it's been getting worse. So, what am I supposed to say here, Emily? I mean, you've been with the department how long? You're an institution. And you do all of this with impunity, going over my head whenever you want. Yes, I'm very sorry about that. So, you tell me, Emily, how am I supposed to react? Well, you did mention the possibility of my having some time off to get my life in order, and I think you're right. Take whatever time you need. Thank you. How did that go? Well, should keep Personnel off my ass for a little bit. You look like you had a rough night. These boys in Records, with their posturing and their competitive drinking. Could barely hide their erections. And did you dig as deep as you could? To the very bottom. We closed the bar. My condolences. Look, that address in Potsdam, none of them has ever seen or heard of it. State records say it's privately owned. Not by us. Sorry. Wish I could've found something better. - Nothing's something. - Mm. Oh, by the way, I saw Ian coming through this morning. He had your ex with him. He was heading into Oversight. What's your trick, Howard? Lying like you do, so comfortably. My trick? Maybe I just really don't know. You've dragged Emily into a mess. First, it was that rendition bullshit. Nearly got her killed. And now this. The address you got from Edgar, what are you two looking for? I'll tell you what I'm looking for. How 'bout a damn good explanation why I'm professionally obligated to tell you anything, other than "fuck off"? Look, what you do over there is not my purview. Section Two, fine. But this, here, this is my turf. Now, what am I missing, you fuck? Boy, she really has a type, doesn't she? - You think this is funny? - Well, I mean, look at it. A few years ago, she leaves me, a colossal asshole, by all accounts. She's free from the worst husband anyone can conjure. And what does she do? She runs off with a guy like you. A guy like me? Yeah, the whole tough guy routine. It's another version of the same thing. Fuck you. Hit a nerve, did I? You actually think we have something in common? You, always fleeing this life for the promise of another. You think we're alike? I'm a pretty good judge. Then where were you, Howard? Where were you years ago, when she was at her worst, bottoming out on detox? Where the hell were you then, if we're so alike? I was there. Sat by her bedside, reading to her every night. When everyone else in her life had given up on her, I was there. You've not one inkling of what it was like for her and I. You couldn't begin to understand. Now, take some responsibility for once in your fucking life. - I'm trying to. - Good. Now, what's this address? You're just wasting time. You're gonna get her killed. I would never let that happen! Do you still love your ex-wife, Howard? - Emily, you can't go in there. - Ridiculous! - Turn this thing off. - No! Please be careful with that. Outside now, please. Have you completely taken leave of your senses? Just trying to get a few things straight. You bring him in here, give him a lie exam - in front of the whole Office? - Oh, you're defending him now? If you have a question, you come to me. I did. At the hospital. You told me you would lay low for a while, that we'd do this thing together. That's what we agreed. What's changed between then and now? He's helping me with my investigation. - Are you fucking serious? - You see? I tell you the truth, and then you shut me down. Let me in, Em. I'm yours first. What's the address? It's a house in Potsdam. Doesn't belong to the Office, at least not officially. Edgar is carrying orders between that house and the embassy over there. Max, call your brother. Get him to bring some mates. We're going to Potsdam. Him, too. ♪ I want to order the lunch special. And I'd like it delivered. Yes? Have I reached the dry cleaners? No. This has never been the dry cleaners. I beg your pardon.

Are you okay? You don't normally do this kind of thing, do you? I don't like it. Do you mind if I... if I ask what happened to your...? Sorry. I was with someone, too. She used to hurt me. That's a long time ago. What did you do? Run. Came here. New city, new life. Fuck her, right? Lots of people run like that. It's normal. Can I? ♪ You took all of these? Yeah. It's a hobby. I like to travel. I think I would like to travel. ♪ Stay. It's okay. Sleep. Nadia. He left this for you. Why did they do that to him... Remove his fingers, his teeth? They do that so the police can't identify the body. But they have his name. Not his real name. He talked to me, you know. He told me what you are. Spies. You work for Russia? The United States? It's better that you don't know. You're alive because he kept you far enough away from all this. Then why do you help me? Because he was my friend. Listen, you need to call the police. Tell them you found him that way. Don't tell them about the money. Okay, put this away. I don't even know who he was. Did you love him? It was a lie. No. My wife... kept things from me. Secrets. When I found out, I... You want my advice? If you loved him, truly... you have to love the lie. I'm sorry to have to ask you this right now. Did you see anything, in the last two or three days, unusual? Anyone you didn't recognize talking to him? I need to find out who did this. You were the only one who talked to him. And that handsome young man you came here with. ♪ What the hell are... Who the fuck is this? - What the fuck are you doing?! - Go! - How many of these are there? - What are you talking about? The hookers... what, do you fucking keep a rotation? No. How...? Do you talk about work with them? Of course I don't talk about fucking work with them, Howard. How stupid do you think I am? What is this about? - Sit down. - Howard! Sit the fuck down! The butcher... My friend... is dead. Now, I have gone to great lengths to cultivate my network on this side, to keep them safe. I do not expose them. You and I were the only ones who went to see him. Okay, Howard, you don't think that I... I'll tell you what I fucking think. I think you better dig hard and fucking fast to find this mole. Because whoever is getting information from your floor, they're getting it from you. Do your fucking job. ♪ ♪ ♪ What the hell? Do you see that? You sure this is the right address? Something's wrong. Max. I hear you visited our daughter. Stay here. See if you can find that low profile we were talking about. Would he go? Ian, give me a gun. ♪ Em, what is this? I don't know. ♪ Darling, are you home? Just putting her to bed. I've got some work to finish before the guests arrive. I'll be in the study. Come in. Sit. We need to speak. I visited an old friend of Walter Atwood's today. You remember Walter? Yeah, former deputy director. He died. This friend, Lamar Jung, was his lover. Yeah, Atwood kept it from friends and family. I remember something about him coming out, after the heart attack. What? Alice was right. There's a mole. And it's worse than we thought. ♪ According to his lover, Atwood felt he was being followed. Weeks before his death. Atwood died of a heart attack. Natural causes. It's impossible to induce that without putting up warning signs. Not impossible. They killed one of ours to make room for one of theirs. And we missed it all this time.
