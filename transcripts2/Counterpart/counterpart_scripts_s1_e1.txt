 Police. Fuck off. Fuck off. Huh? How did he get away? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Yeah, it's me. We have a problem. Something went wrong with the deal. Yeah. Baldwin's gone.

 'Cause I've got his visas right here, yeah. He didn't get them. He can't get to their world. No, there was a hooker in the bathroom. She might have seen something. Yeah. Bring her to you. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Why do you punish yourself? Come on, now. Even a game lost is a game well played.

 Spoken like a man who is about to lose. I'm trying to teach you. There's your problem. You're too nice. And this always ends the same. Oh, well. Next time. Sometimes I get the feeling you let me win these games. Where would be the lesson in that? ♪ ♪ ♪ "I took the long way to work today." "The weather was too hot for riding." "It never cools off at this time of year." "My mother loves the winter, but she lives in the south." "Mine is partial to spring." "Flowers in the air." "Orchids." "Always a good season for orchids." Y-You have... The girls are saying you've got a meeting upstairs. You should stop charming those women. Is it the Strategy job? Howard. My brother. Honestly? I do not think you should waste your time. - Oh, you don't? - No. Just let it go. Pretend it never happened. I think you're just afraid you're gonna miss me. This way, please. Wait, please. In the circle. This way. Oh. Hello. They brought this in. I'd share it, but... Oh, what's that, your resume? No, we have it on the, um, on the computer. Yeah. Howard... Silk. Howard Silk. Been in the Office 29 years. Worked your way up to Interface. As you can see, I've made Row Designation six years now. Oh, sorry to hear about your wife, by the way. How-how is she? Uh, sh-she's improving. - Yeah? - Thank you. Yeah. Her coworkers speak very highly of her. I've never met her myself, but, uh... At my last review, uh, they mentioned there was an opening in Strategy. - Sorry, where do you live? - Sorry, what? - Where do you live? - I'm sor... - Uh, Veilsdorf. - Do you like it there? - It's quiet. - Drives me mad. I went out with a girl from there once... not very long. I mean, you have to get into a cab to find a decent meal, don't you? As-as you can see, I, uh... I've been with Interface for quite some time now. Mm. No, yeah, one of our best. No one has ever had a complaint about you. Excellent. Uh... I was hoping there would be room for me in Strategy. An opportunity to serve at a higher level. More relevant. I'm sorry, Howard, but that post has been filled. When? Howard, you're an Interface man. Everyone likes you there. There's no need to upset the cart, is there? I-If... if I could just have an interview... You know, Oversight were looking at your tapes from this morning. Apparently, there was a non-approved exchange. Uh, I'm sorry. - Uh, uh, "non-approved"? - Hmm. Man of your experience, you'd think you'd know better. The man had a... a spot on his... With all due respect, Mr. Quayle... I have come to this building every day and done my job. I understand secrecy, security. Three decades I've given to this office. But, honestly, sometimes it scares me. I don't know what we do here. I certainly don't understand why telling a stranger that he has a spot on his tie makes one shred of difference. Howard, it's been 30 years. If it was gonna happen, it would have happened. Yeah. Howard. We're celebrating. Drinks? What's the occasion? Eh, Marcel, the bastard. He got himself that Strategy job. Why don't you come? Uh, uh, no, I can't. Um... plans. Congratulations. ♪ Yeah, okay. I've been trying you all week. Should have occurred to me I could've just found you here. Yes, it should have. My mother's always been difficult. It's no secret. But I'm the one who still has to live with her. She wants what she wants. You came all the way here just to tell me that? There's been no improvement. Yes. Concussive trauma can take up to a year... I know, Howard. I've spoken to them, too. But we have to be realistic. It's been six weeks. They're moving her to long-term care. All our mother wants is to have her at home... if the time comes. Have a look at this. Sign it when you've had a moment. She wants her surrounded by family. I'm her family. I tell you what, I'll pop it over here. Please think it over. ♪ I have a new book. "You, only. Only you... exist." ♪ ♪ You know who I am? Yes. Aldrich. Housekeeping. Do you know why we might want to speak? I told you, he doesn't know a damn thing. He's nobody. Go and get him. Sorry. It's his job to be disliked. I... Have I done something wrong? Listen, Howard, we have a bit of a situation. Um, something we need to bring you in on. Me? Someone's walked in from the other side. It might be a defection. Don't really know what else to call it. I'm-I'm sorry, the other side? I... Well, typically we don't entertain this sort of business. Strangers come over, we turn them away. But this one is... different. He... he's valuable. And... Well, he's only willing to speak to you. Just, whatever you do... don't panic. This is a bad idea. Wha... What... Hi, Howard. Well, this is disappointing. Why did you come over, Howard? I'm Howard. Does he really not know what's going on? What level are you? - He's an Interface man. - Enough. - He's wasting our time. - Believe me, I'm not. But I have to be back in about 12 minutes, so let's discuss terms. First, no one outside this room knows about this arrangement. Why would we listen to a word you have to say? Because if you don't, people start dying. A kill order came out from my side, targeting people on your side. - Bullshit. - Yeah, I get it. You're skeptical. You've made that very clear. If there is a problem, we go to the Fourth Floor. Your Fourth Floor may be compromised. He's lying. There's no intelligence to confirm any of this. All due respect, your intelligence is kind of a shit show right now. Okay, well, this was fun. Got to go. Wait. Who's on the list? Not till I know where you stand. I'll be back tomorrow. Longer visa. "Courier duty." You have until then to make up your mind. And we're gonna need this one, so you might want to... I don't know, read him in. Wow. Interface. Perfect. - What is this?! - Oh, shut up, Howard. J-Just let me think for a second, okay? He looks exactly like me. He is you, Howard. Really, do you have any idea how lucky you are? No one... no one... Gets to meet their other. Other? -Everyone wonders about it, but... Mr. Quayle, you brought me into that room. Please tell me what is going on. 30 years ago, during the Cold War, there was an experiment, an accident, in this building. Eastern scientists... Something went wrong. They opened up a passage directly beneath us. When you go through this door, you come out the other side, you're in another world, identical to ours. I... Identical to ours? Same events, same experiences. So, where this building stands, where we are now, - this is called the Crossing. - Wh... But... Identical to ours? He-he... he looks exactly like me, but he is nothing like me. So, when this door opened, our paths began to branch off. More and more, over time. This... this is not my job to tell you this, Howard. You shouldn't even... What you need to know is we keep a lid on it. We trade information, we gather intelligence - from the other side. - What-what kind of intelligence? That's not important. To you. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay, who else knows about this? Out... Outside this building? What do you think? I-I don't know... Governments, world leaders? Some. That's... It's murky. I don't... Look, Howard, you know this now. But you do not know this. Is he gone? - Yes. He gave me a name. - From the kill list? Emily Silk, his wife. - Wh-What about my wife? - She's in the hospital. - Albert Schweitzer. - Okay, we'll put a watch on her, - as a precaution. - Hold... What, are you saying - my wife is in danger? - No, no, she's fine. Howard, you know what? Go back to work. Wh-What does my wife have to do with any of this? We'll handle it. She'll be safe. We'll be in touch. What did he say? We have to be very cautious about it. ♪ Gin and tonic, bitte. ♪ Hey. Hey. - Marcel. - Ja? Very quiet this morning. Do you think... life is just a sum of our choices? You do something and I react. You do it often enough... my reaction changes. We're changing, all the time. Those choices define who we are. No. Who we are is not about choice. It's not? You are who you are. I am what I am. And the game only ends one way. Know your problem? You're too young. ♪ Purpose of visit? Bringing the embassy pouch. 12-hour visa. It's better on my side. One of ours was killed last night. Not here. You know who carried this out? Don't know much about her. Her? Yeah, we didn't know that until the other night. She skipped out on a crash meeting by posing as a hooker. Handle is Baldwin. She's a contract assassin. Killed some good men on my side. That your dead man's dossier? Marcel. Double tap entry. No witnesses. Marcel was killed? Howard, you wouldn't happen to have any cream, would you? So why did they target this man? I don't know. He was Strategy? He was just promoted. Hmm. Look, I'm sorry. We've done our part, all right? We... we keep doing everything you've asked for. It's time for you to be a little more forthright. What is this about? There's been some infighting in leadership on my side. You've been aware of it? We heard a few things. There's a faction, may be trying a takeover. Unclear who, exactly. They're hard-line, ideological, don't care much for diplomacy. What do they want? It's been bad on my side for months now. Contentious, defection talk. People have been disappearing. - And now the fight spills over. - So what is this? They're just picking off our people at random? It's not random. I don't know what it is, but it's not random. Ah, enough. We have to tell the Fourth Floor. -No. Right now, nobody knows about this arrangement. We need to keep it that way. I... I'm-I'm sorry to interrupt, but I... I don't understand. Why do they want to hurt Emily? My guess is to send me a message. By threatening my wife? Wh-Why not yours? My Emily's dead. Cancer. What's your designation? Officially, I'm 4C, Diplomacy. But I'm Section Two. I've spent my career building our clandestine operational network on your side. So Section Two is real. What about, uh, the other Emily? Where is she, at work? No. Um... six weeks ago, she was crossing the street, and a... a car came out of nowhere. Kid driving, wasn't paying attention. She's in a coma. So she's in a hospital? Yeah. -All right. I need to know everything. If Baldwin is operating on this side, your wife may be her next target. We have guards. - Hold 'em back. - Hold them back? Look, the only advantage we have right now is she doesn't know I'm here. She's methodical, she studies routine. One break in that, and she might call it off. - When do you visit? - Every night. All right, I'll go in your place tonight. Howard, why do you think I brought you in on this? For your great tactical skill? Your in-depth knowledge of this whole fucking thing? I need to pretend to be you, take Baldwin out myself. You don't make these decisions. Yeah, you're right. I don't. He does. Fine. We'll arrange things on our end. We'll be ready in... What-what do you think? We start immediately. Excellent. You two stay here until then. Get acquainted. If he makes one left instead of a right, kill him. ♪ Like looking in a mirror? This was my favorite tie. I lost it years ago. Keep it. I-I haven't worn it in years. Okay, let's talk routine. You go in, straight up to her room. Anyone you interact with regularly? Uh... the nurses. I say hello. No one else, really. Here, I-I want you to try this. It's from the bakery downstairs. No, thanks. Please, indulge me. It's a... I spent a summer in Maine when I was a kid. Yeah, I was there. Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Right. We spent. Remember Dad got the... the funnel cakes? Yeah. I really can't. High cholesterol. Really? Yeah. You don't have it? I-I don't think so. Okay. There's so many things I want to ask you about. Memories and... feelings that I've had my whole life that only belonged to me. And now it's... us. We share... genetics. A childhood. So? So how did we get to be so different? You'd drive yourself crazy trying to chart it out. Seriously, people have. What kind of music do you listen to? I don't care for it. Favorite food? Taste buds must be the same. I don't know. American, I guess. Chinese. It's fascinating. Tell you what I've been wondering. How come you never got out of Interface? All these years, you never moved up. What held you back? I don't know. - Just, uh, life, I guess. - Seriously? - Life? That's your excuse? - Well... I mean, I'm not, I'm not making excuses. You have regrets? Yeah, some. See, this is what's so fucked up. Genetics, childhood... Doesn't matter. We're helpless to our experience. Difference between you and me could be a single moment, one little thing gone wrong. Or right. Okay, routine. At the hospital. Um... I, uh, I read to her. Books she likes. Um, you know, poetry, mostly. Whitman, Rilke, you know. Stay in touch with any of her family? - Just Eric. - That piece of shit. - Eric always had it out for us. - Yeah. Tried to talk her out of the wedding? Wedding? Yeah, the... wedding. 28 years ago, October. We eloped. 28 years? Wasn't that right after we'd met? When you know, you know. Our first date, when she, uh, left the table to wash up, I said to the waiter, "I'm gonna marry her." I just knew. I... I couldn't get to sleep last night. I was... I was so excited. I... I was thinking, if there's another me, that means there's another her. But... She gonna make it? It's too early to tell. Were you, um... Were you there... for her at the end? Uh, I, um... I wasn't perfect. You have regrets. Which one are you? - Fuck off. - It's time. ♪ Oh, wait. Uh, can you pull over right here? What is it? I'll be right back. Here. I always bring her flowers. Radio. Give him one, too. Uh, we got two men on every exit. He told you everything? Yeah, take a right off the elevator, room 322. Flowers. Give me a gun. Our guard is never down. All right. Keep your people out of sight, huh? Howard, wait. Um... the, uh... the nurse on duty tonight is named Talia. Keep him out of sight, too, huh? Pull around back. ♪ ♪ What did you talk about, the two of you, in your apartment? Cholesterol. 10:00. There's a visitor. - Is it her? - No. Male. 40s, well dressed. Uh, that could be Eric. - Who the fuck is Eric? - Her brother. Okay. What do I need to know? He left a contract on the, on the table by the door. What is this? You didn't sign it. No. No, of course not. You weren't going to. It's... complicated. Get rid of him. Well, I'm leaving for the airport. So what do I tell her? Listen. Their mother wants her back in England. Howard, sign the fucking thing, get him out of there. It's time to let go, Howard. Let her be with family. This is about me, isn't it? You tried to warn her away from me - from the beginning. - Stop it. She was in love. She was happy. And you tried to ruin the one good thing she had. I'm gonna ask you one more time, and then I'm gonna leave 'cause this is childish. She will sue you until you submit. You understand that? Sign it. Let's be done with this. Just sign the fucking thing. No. - Oh, for fuck sake. - I'm sorry? I said no. Let me tell you something, Eric. This is something very few people will tell you. You're a real fucking asshole. Guys like you confuse words with action. I don't. So I will be very, very clear. If you or anyone in your family try to take her away from me, we will be done. There will be nothing left to say. And believe me, Eric, the last thing you want is me with nothing left to say. Incoming female. Howard, what in God's name...? - Shh. - I think it's her. Go. Whoa. Listen to me. Someone is coming up here to kill her. - What? - Shut the fuck up. Stay in this room, stay away from the door. I'm trying to save your life here. Do you understand me? Eric. Do you understand me? Yeah. Yes. Not a fucking sound. ♪ Where is she? Coming up the elevator now. ♪ ♪ What are...? She's on the second floor! Second floor! ♪ Outside! Fast! You okay? She got away. Where you going? To check on my wife. What the hell is happening? Just get on the plane, Eric. It's okay, you can go. It's safe. ♪ ♪ So what happens next? She'll try again. And? I'll get another visa. Might take 24 hours, maybe longer. Meantime, you keep watch. We're gonna need that one again. I'll talk to him. ♪ You know, I remember when I first found out. It doesn't normally happen like this, you know. There's-there's people you have to talk to. There's, like, doctors and psychiatrists. You're read in. There's this whole process. And you, you... You... Do you have any idea the world that's just opened up to you, Howard? ♪ So we can count on you to help us? Thanks for the ride. Howard. H... Howard. Howard! What do you want? I'll tell you what I want. I-I want the promotion that I should have had three days ago. Howard, that-that's not even possible. And real access. Real operational knowledge. I think, after 30 years, I deserve that. Okay, Howard, look, you don't understand. Uh, it doesn't work like that. Here's what I do understand. You need me now. So, I guess you got to...
