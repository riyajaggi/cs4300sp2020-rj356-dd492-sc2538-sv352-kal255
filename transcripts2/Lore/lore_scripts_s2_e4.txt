 constructed for the greatest city in the world. And like any precious jewel, she was jealously protected. Once the clock stopped, the city stopped. The future of Prague was cursed. [horse sputters] JAN: Dirvick. Stop it. It is just a mask. I know. I thought Prague was clear of the plague. Brother, think instead of clocks. [laughs]: Clocks. Yes.

 It's a marvel. It may as well be a statue. And it will put money in our pockets. [laughs] [gasps] Can we help you, death-man? I am Dr. Kristoff Brehovy, and I'm looking for Jan and Dirvick Mirandesh. Unless they are your masters? Sir, we are the men you seek. You look like Turks. Uh... We have no country. And no plague. So keep your distance. But your letter says Jan and Dirvick of Bohemia. You mean our letter to the mayor? Yeah, God rest his soul. The foul plague, that is the reason I am here. But it does not explain why you are here. -It is where we live now. -[flies buzzing] And those are good names for where we live, yes? [quietly]: Dirvick. Don't mind him. I'm sorry, are there any clockmakers here? We can be on our way. No, no, no, no. No, I, uh, I apologize. Welcome to Prague. And to your new home. Come. Come. Oh. [gasps] [laughs softly] You'll have to forgive my brother, he's a... a bit enthusiastic. It shows me that my faith in your expertise is well-placed. JAN: Well, more his than mine. My skill lies more in the care and feeding of Dirvick's enthusiasms. To your benefit, of course. Ah, it's a wonder. KRISTOFF: This clock has remained silent for 60 years. Now, if your brother can make the hands move and the bell toll again... -Well, as long as our price is agreeable... -Yes. ...you don't have to take another step in here ever again. Oh. Many men like you have tried, and many have failed. Uh, master clockmaker... Master? Oh, I am no master, merely a journeyman seeking to prove his capabilities. [chuckles] Eh, what Dirvick means is that in the shadow of the Orloj, no clockmaker could consider himself a master, unless he first masters this machine. It's not merely one machine, brother. -Hmm? -These are many. Clocks within clocks, each driving the others. And the complication of the clocks themselves... These, too, individual machines, built with a single purpose, but operating in concert with the whole. -It moves, Jan. -Or will, when we're done. Kristoff has, uh, made a generous offer... I would fix it for pleasure. As you can see, my brother has his function, and I have mine. I-If there's anything else you need, please send for me. Well, um, this job is bigger than any one man or two men, no matter how en-enthusiastic. The foreman will join you tomorrow. -Just the foreman? -No, no, no. He-He'll bring whatever men he decides are suitable. -Good evening. -Good evening. Fix it for the pleasure? ♪ ♪ [tongue clicking rhythmically] Hello? Um... Aah! [groaning] JAN: Dirvick? -Master! -[Dirvick groaning] Look what I brought. -Did you see it? -What? Some of the gears moved. Impossible. Nothing has moved in this clock over 60 years. Mm. Come. What happened to your hand? Here... take it. Ow. [laughs]: You were meant to drink that. Fix yourself, clockmaker. [Dirvick panting] The Orloj is our home. And the only good one in some time. In your letter, you lied to them, didn't you? You said I'm a master clockmaker. What would you have me say? Hmm? My brother has grand ambitions. Please pay him as though he has already received his hoped-for recognition. I am who I am. I am not ashamed. You should not be ashamed. But we should not go hungry, either. Hmm? Worry more about your hand than your reputation as an artisan. If it gets worse, I'll send for the surgeon in the morning. Hmm? Now, hold still. [Dirvick hisses] -[chuckles] -Ow. I'm more worried about the clock. There are no plans. Who builds a wonder like this and leaves no plans behind? JAN: Someone very confident or very stupid. [kisses] It's madness. There is a little madness in every genius, brother. Now, sleep. Plans are for daylight. [grunts] [laughter, indistinct chatter] You are the foreman? We were promised a full crew. We're paying for double the men. You're paying double for these. Ridiculous. What is ridiculous is that I managed to convince these men to enter the cursed clock. You're not the first to come here with plans to restore the Orloj. Superstitions and fairy tales. No, death and nightmares. They all went mad, my friend. And those that stayed too long... died. The city has suffered since then, pestilence run amok. Well, you've seen the fires, the masks? The shell of what Prague was and they say it's because the clock doesn't want to be restored. If all of that is true, what are you doing here? Well, you're paying double. And I'm hungry. [flies buzzing] [horse whinnies] [indistinct chatter] There are no such things as curses. [indistinct chatter] MAN: There you go. -Now, you pass that one down. -Got it. [indistinct chatter continues] MAN: All right, there it is. There it is. FOREMAN: And this isn't the only assembly we've found in such a state. I just don't understand how something like this could happen. It didn't. It... it was deliberate. As I said, the clock doesn't want to be restored. [chuckles] Or someone doesn't. That's certain. Show me the rest. [tongue clicking rhythmically] Ah... [continues clicking tongue] [pants] [yelling] Take a hammer to it or pray to the Lord. -[men shouting] -We have to stop it before it kills your brother. Whatever makes it stop. [screaming] [men shouting] KRISTOFF: The Orloj is many clocks within one clock, all turning in perfect synchronization. It was Master Clockmaker Hanus Carolinum who breathed life into this clock's unique astrological functions. Some people believe there was a deeper purpose, to give her the power to forecast the fates of kings and countries. The Orloj told not just the time. The Orloj told the future. JAN: The clock moved on its own. And what really matters is what they believe. And they believe in the curse. I'm sorry. I'll collect my brother and ask only payment for time and expenses. Stay. They'll pay you double. Now who's mad? Two men doing the job of 20. We'll find you men who are not afraid of stories. There are curses and there are those who are being cursed. There's only one cure for both: hope. -Double, you said? -Yes, double. -Okay. -Good. ♪ ♪ [ethereal singing] [gears clanking] Brother? I have been back and forth across the city and return with excellent news... and news somewhat less than excellent. All right, so... [chuckles] none of the news is good. No. No. Unless you're you. Because you're the one who offered to fix this monstrosity... [chuckles] for the pleasure. Your pleasure. Oh. All right. Not quite that bad. They doubled our pay. Thank you. My pleasure. Yes. Oh, my pleasure. And... [chuckles] we don't have to share it with a soul. [laughs] Nope. Nope, because we are on our own. Again. No crew. Social animal that you are, I am sure you weep at the very thought. Huh? Where are you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, you. You. What are you staring at? Huh? This? [laughs] How dare you to judge me when your Lord and Savior made endless supply out of water in Canaan. [liquid splashes] Dirvick? Brother. It's a cursed city. I saw things, horrible things. Show me your hand. -You should have come to me. -Soldiers, brother. Women and children under the sword, and worse. Flame consuming nearly every building. Great, black buzzing birds raining death from the skies. Eyes on fire. Clockwork monsters on wheels and tracks, rolling through the streets of Prague. Quiet. Rest your mind. We need to find you a surgeon tonight. DIRVICK: It showed me all of it. It cursed them with it. I can stop it. I can fix the clock. Dirvick, enough. I have this. You see? I found this. It's the key to unlock the missing piece. Enough, I said. You could lose your entire arm. Is that what you want? Huh? We are leaving now. Dirvick. -Dirvick. -No. Dirvick, stop it. Dirvick, stop it. -Please! -[growling]: No! Dirvick. Dirvick, stop! [coughs] [panting] ♪ ♪ [flies buzzing] What your brother suffers from is neither the plague, nor any contagion I can identify. I don't understand. All of that from a cut in his palm? -There was no sickness when you arrived? -No. God, his eyes. KRISTOFF: The blood is not the worst of it. JAN: You don't understand. This would be like denying him food, air. KRISTOFF: Your brother rots from the outside in. I am sure there must be something. What afflicts your brother is not disease. It's the curse. -Do you want to save your brother? -Of course I do. -Because he's your livelihood? -Because I love him. Then break the curse. I-I don't believe in the curse. The clock, it does not take any interest in what you believe. Your brother has, at most, days to live. Fix it. Make the Orloj turn again. Break the curse while some time remains. KRISTOFF: Beauty, they say, is in the eye of the beholder. It can inspire many things. Oftentimes, jealousy and greed. The masters of the city didn't want the splendor of the Orloj to be given to any other cities. They threatened Master Hanus to never replicate it, but he refused. The soldiers, like they often do when carrying out orders from those in charge, showed no mercy. [screaming] KRISTOFF: Master Hanus found his way back to the clock. He uttered a curse on the city of Prague. Terror, destruction, and to those who would dare repair the Orloj, madness and death. Then hurled himself into the machine, sanctifying his dark wishes in his own blood. I was there that night, you see. [bones crunching] ♪ ♪ I was just a boy then, but I saw the clock weep with blood. And so, it seems, did he. Doctor, I have spent the whole day in the clock trying to make sense, but I have no expertise, no crew, no plans. And no choice. Save your brother. Save all of us. [gears clanking] [crying] These are plans. You drew plans. Brother, you obsessive lunatic boy. We're going to beat you! [gears clicking] Dirvick and I, we're going to fix this damned clock, and you can take your vengeance and your curse and your doomed futures back to Hell! We're going to beat you. [laughing] I have plans, but no one to help me, and I cannot do this alone. Hey. The clock is trying to take my brother. I did not return for your brother's sake. -Then money, triple your rate. -Nor money. When the clock almost took my hand... fires, deaths, burned-out buildings, metal beasts, burned-out eyes. I have seen things, horrible things. [metallic squeaking] [grunts softly] Stay with me. Please. [flies buzzing] [chickens clucking] It's complete. Every gear. Just as your brother specified. JAN: Beautiful. But it is not running. N-No, I-I couldn't. Not again. Please... you start it. Just, uh, t-turn the handle. And-and be careful. You are certain all is correct? Well, as certain as I-I can be, Jan. I'm no clockmaker. Nor am I. Must've missed something, uh... Perhaps in the, in the trigger. Here, I'll-I'll return in the morning. Of course. We'll start again. ♪ ♪ The key. The ring. [gears clicking] [chuckling] You are beaten! Dirvick. We fixed it. We did. Together. Dirvick. Dirvick? We fixed the clock. Fix the clock, break the curse. [sobbing] For what it matters, I-I am so sorry. Sorry? You told me... fixing the clock would save him, reverse the disease. I knew there was little hope for your brother, but there was hope for us. Hope to fix my father's sins. Hope to ease the suffering of the people of Prague. -But you lied. -You lied when you invented your names. We-we do lie sometimes. I-I lied. My father was one of the soldiers who created the curse. [screaming] His actions have tortured the people of the city ever since. But you and your brother-- Turks, even-- saved us. I know your brother had a tragic, tragic death, but his life saved us. You murdered my brother. He wanted to help. He wanted to stay. To pay for the sins of your father? I did it for the city of Prague. The little mother shall live. The plague shall leave us. We shall be cured. You... have cured us! Don't you see that? False hope is crueler than no hope. [sniffles] [creaking, ticking] Aah! Yes. Yes, of course. I'm so sorry. [Jan screaming] [bones crunching] Jan? [gears stop] ♪ ♪
