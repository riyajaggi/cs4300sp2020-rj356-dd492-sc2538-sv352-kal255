 What? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Whiskey! The one damned thing this country does right. 'Cause treating us Irish folk is definitely not on the list. I'll drink to that. From one second-class immigrant to another. [laughs] I love ya. Donald, you want to join? Donald! [chuckles] Lookie here, he's had a head start. We'll be back, Donny boy. But for now? Ah, whiskey.

 Come on. [singing incoherently] [lively music playing inside] [people cheering inside] Hey! Must be Padraig's Day. HARE: It's November! I know. My point is there must be a reason for the party. There's no reason to need a reason. Aye, well said. Jamie! [rhythmic whooping, clapping] -[cheering] -[lively music continues] [laughs] [laughs] The little fella sure can move his... his foot. BURKE: Whittles at a pub again? I imagine the ladies love you for your big knife. -[music ends] -A cheer for the wee lad, Jamie! [cheering] Yeah! SHOLTO: A cheer for all! [cheering] Enjoy this round, people, courtesy of yours truly! [cheering] [chanting]: Sholto! Sholto! Sholto! -[lively music playing] -[laughing] There's that Sholto. He's up there buying the house drinks. Hey, bless him. Hey, it's a bit of a slap in the face, isn't it? He owes me 11 shillings. They're free. All that matters is... -11 shillings. -For what? He's not very good at cards. Well, he's right there, isn't he? [both whooping] [crowd cheering] [Hare laughing] Now 11 shillings, you great cow. -Oh, was it that much? -11. -Or one. -One what? HARE: Yeah, one cut, right through your eye, boy. SHOLTO: All right, all right. -Easy. -[lips smack] Plus interest, for my friend's suffering. Or maybe he'll slice you up anyway. No, no, no, no, please. [sighs] If you'll indulge me, gentlemen, I have a business proposition that will make that look a pittance. But, um, in private, please. [clears throat] [lively music continues] -And all in the name of science. -Until you get caught. A corpse technically isn't property, so we're not stealing. -Uh, legally speaking, it's just... -HARE: Trespassing. Which is why we get creative. They set up a watchtower, we go under. -Tunnels. -Exactly. The doctors in Surgeon's Square, they pay for every body, no matter the condition. You see, they're in a-a race to cure the diseases, and they need bodies to study. Now, Robert Knox, he's my doc on the inside. And you're cutting us in because...? -Well, start with the knife. -Good point. And? My crew are not exactly responsible types. Look, they don't always show up. I-I need two I can count on. Right? When and where? Two hours. Charity Workhouse. -Whorehouse? -Oh, that's the charity. -[chuckles] -I'm going there now. That's for the debt and the drinks. -[music ends] -[applause] Grave robbing. Is that what it's come to, is it? Digging dead bodies out of the ground. They're dead, Billy. They have no opinion. Listen, we can make more working one night in the ground than six months on the docks, and you're afraid of what? Of what? -The magistrate? -Yeah, the magistrate. -And the Good Lord. -[laughs] The Good Lord. "The Good Lord," he says. Hmm. [exhales] Let God have his go in Heaven. Let me handle things here, in the actual Earth, all right? We can't just go steal dead bodies out... Yeah... Bodies, theoretically. Donald? Donald, is you all right there, mate? Shit. Poor chap. -[sighs] -How long has he been dead? [sighs] Long enough, I suppose. With no family to speak of. Better get him to a hospital. Aye. Hospital. Or... to a surgeon? For a small fee, of course. [scoffs softly] [whispers]: In the name of science. ♪ ♪ Is this the right one? Can't be knocking on wrong doors all morning. Hey, Billy, relax. It says "Knox" right there. Knocking for Knox. Hey, all right. [clears throat] [door opens] Uh, Sholto Macdonald sent us. -[metal clicks] -[door creaks] Up! [door closes] [grunting, panting] KNOX: Hmm. Not a speck of dirt. [sniffing] No rot... [sniffs] beyond the alcohol, which I'm sure all of you have taken. The world in Scotland may be very different from what you're used to in Dublin, lads. Uh, sorry, sir. I'm from Urney. Well, Dublin, Urney, Cork. You're all the same over there, aren't you? [chuckles] Scotland's place in the world depends on the advances we make for our humble audiences right here in this operating theatre. Oh. -Whoa. -Dropsy. Ah, ha. Delicious. You see, you may not have medicine in, uh, Dublin, which is why you all come running over here like little foxes. But we do. And a body like this will help us cure a condition like this. You, boy, bottle this up. And you, pay these men. Seven pounds and 14 shillings. Oh, and, gentlemen. If you have any more in this pristine condition, I will compensate you more than adequately. [crowd cheering in distance] -You screwed me last night. -Oh. I thought I could count on you! Fat man, here, have a pint. Here. Apologies for not showing up, right? But as Lord as my witness, we did not resurrect a single soul last night. SHOLTO: So where'd you get the money, then? Donald. Jamie. None? How do you live, boy? -Here, Jamie, lad. -Aye. Milk it is. -Hey! Hey! Hey! -[crowd cheering] Cheers, to all ye filthy Scots! -Yeah! -[cheering] Who the hell is Donald? "Was" Donald. Good friend. Was. [laughs] [rooster crows in distance] -PUNCH: Ah! I hate you! -JUDY: Well, I hate you more. PUNCH: Ah, come here, ha! [snickering] [laughter] Judy, did you hear that if you're buried, -you might not meet your maker? -Oh? -Yes. Come here. -♪ Da, da-da, da-da, da-da. ♪ [bell dings] -[laughter] -What was that for? PUNCH: I wanted to see what would happen if I had to bury you. JUDY: I'd be at rest and my soul would go to Heaven. -PUNCH: Hell. -JUDY: Heaven. -Heaven. -Hell. PUNCH: But some people will not get that pleasure. JUDY: Oh? Indeed. They're called resurrectionists. Resu-what? -[laughter] -Grave robbers, Judy. -Nobody is safe. -JUDY: But why not use all the dead bodies that die from sickness? Because they can only use the bodies of criminals. It's the law! So they can definitely use yours. Uh-huh. -[laughter] -BURKE: Hey. We have work to do. ♪ ♪ You seem quieter than normal, and that's saying something. I don't like it. What, the money? -Playing God. -Billy. We're two Irish immigrants sitting in a pub on a Sunday afternoon when most people are in church. There ain't nothing God-like about any of this. [exhales] 'Tisn't right. ABIGAIL: Something wet, if you would. [hacking, coughing, retching] Hey, hey. Kindly keep all your consumption to yourself. It ain't dropsy, but she's still got to be worth more than the average healthy whore. Wet enough? -Nope. -Allow me to rectify that. -My name is William Burke. -Abigail Simpson. -[retches, coughs] -Ugh. -[chuckles] -[retching] Oh, that's a nasty cough you got. [chuckles] And in this cold, you could catch your death. You know? Ah, shit. Ain't no cold, and you know it. My condolences, then. Don't want your... condol... condol... What you said. In that case, how about another? -[chuckling] -Eh? [laughing] ♪ ♪ -Mmm. -[sighs] -[coughing] -[laughing] [laughing] Whiskey! [laughs] Angus, here. [whoops] Oh! [laughing] [incoherent mumbling] Boys, get her out of here before she's a corpse! Wouldn't want that, huh? -[incoherent mumbling] -[straining] Okay. [Abigail hacking, retching] Where'd you say you lived again? The floor. I can find it myself. -HARE: Wh-What are you doing? -BURKE: Hey. She's not gonna make it through the night. Yeah, the night's hardly done, and... That's why you were doing all this, why you brought her all the drinks? Billy, it's an investment, okay? She's not gonna... -So much for your investment. -Shit! Hey, Liam! Liam, come back! [shushes] [coughing] [whispers]: Come on. All but embalmed. Yet still drawing breath. [Burke grunts] [panting] I could use a bit of help. -You've lost your mind. -Seven pounds, Billy! Seven pounds, and you want to give it up for this drunk?! Now who's lost his mind?! Fine! Fine. [chuckles] Ah... Oh, God. [sighs, groans] -[straining] -[muffled groaning] -Jesus! Oh, no, no, no. -No! No! No! [coughing, screaming] Billy! -Billy! -Get off! Get off! Get off me! [muffled screaming] [straining loudly] [straining loudly] [muffled groaning quiets] [muffled groaning stops] [panting] -What the hell was that?! -Shh! Shush! Shh. Shh! Science. Hey. Help me up with it. Billy! Yeah, yeah, yeah. [grunts] [panting]: Okay. Okay. Okay. And what am I supposed to do with this? Aye. Her head's a bit mussed, but the rest, totally fresh and, um, clean-ish, except for the consumption bit, which I assumed that you'd want? Yes, yes, yes, but the face... No matter how pristine the rest of the body may be underneath, the face is the first thing these students will see, and they may not believe that the rest of the body doesn't follow suit. My recent samples, though purchased at a discount price, have put me in fourth place in a three horse race. This is all about research and performance, gentlemen. If I can't show this body to the rest of the medical community, if I can't perform with the best samples and further my discoveries, then this lot will leave and go to a competitor's operating theatre with better... wares. And this, all of this, my life's work, will cease to exist. And I will not have that! Do you cretins understand? Uh-huh. [clears throat] Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good. In civilized countries, this is what we call an understanding. We now have an understanding. You only get six pounds and a free lesson in what we in Scotland consider -the work ethic. -[bell dings] Quality counts, gentlemen. Do not let your Irish roots get in the way of doing a good job here. -Mm. Oh, and, gentlemen. [quietly]: Be very careful how you acquire the merchandise. I don't want coppers around here. They're much better suited to your part of the town. Now begone. -[lively music playing] -[crowd cheering] BURKE: You don't talk much, do you? I've heard you two are the life of the party. Let's have a good time. HARE: Far from the confines of the Charity, aren't you, love? -I go where the work is. -This is where the work isn't. -Too much woman for you? -Too much for the woman. Off you run. Plenty of suitors looking to ruin you proper. -[glass shatters] -[music stops] Look at this miserable shite! What in the name of all that is holy is that hideous thing? The boy doesn't talk. Oh, he can't even talk out of that hole, chin face? Disfigured and mute, you scabby roaster? -INNKEEPER: Hey! Hey! -[sobbing] Get her out of here! -Get out of here! -[crowd shouting] -HARE: Hey. -Get out of here! All right, boy. You're all right, boy. You're all right. Somebody take care of him. M'lady! M'lady! Ah. Apologies. Ah. We shouldn't have let them treat you like that. So, uh... Apology accepted. -[laughs]: Oh. -Lead the way. -[giggling] -[growls] HARE: Hey! What's going on? Just gonna let off some steam. Nothing to worry about. [both laughing] ♪ ♪ Oy! You afraid of me, are you? What about you? [chuckles] [gasps] Oh, so you like it rough? [laughs] Oy! Hey. Let go. Mm. Billy, remember, quality matters. Miss, my name is William Burke. This here is my partner, Billy Hare. MARY: I don't care, boys. BURKE: Good. Where was I? Ah, yes. Like this. [shrieks] [muffled screaming] Billy! Hop on! Hop on! [muffled screaming continues] -[muffled crying] -[grunting] [muffled grunting] [muffled grunting quiets] -[muffled grunting stops] -[panting] [bell dings] He's doing well for himself. 'Cause of us, mate. KNOX: The effects of prostitution on the body and their diseases. ♪ ♪ -Here we go. -There we go. -BURKE: Hare? -Yeah, yeah. [bell dings] KNOX: The effects of alcohol. -[crowd cheering] -[pounding on table] -[bell dinging] -Hey! -[laughs] -How are you, love? -Is that your house? -[giggling] -Whoa-oh! -[screaming, laughing] [bell dings] [laughing] Hey, don't run off with her. -Come on. -[grunting] KNOX: Comparable ages and body types. We can use one as a control. ♪ ♪ There's not a speck of dirt on you two. -Science. -Science. -[crowd cheering] -[bell dinging] Here's to Billy Hare and Liam Burke! [laughs] Oh! ♪ ♪ [coughing] It's a bit late for a child to be out. What do you suppose he's worth? Nothing. Yeah, you're right. People would know. You think that's the problem? [scoffs] What? Hey. ♪ ♪ [muffled whimpering] [muffled scream] [bell dings] [groans] [sighs] Where you going to? You go ahead. [sniffles] I need to get some fresh air. And a bed. [laughs]: Ah, ha, ha! Someone's going to the Charity shop, hey? Hey, don't let them overcharge you this time, Billy! Billy! Billy! -[Punch and Judy grunting] -[thunder rumbles softly] PUNCH: Judy, do you know what I hate? Me? Yes, but that's only because you're my wife. -[Judy grunting] -[crowd gasping] I deserved that. -JUDY: Who else, then? -The Irish. And doctors. PUPPET KNOX [echoing]: Did somebody call a doctor? -[Judy shrieks] -PUNCH: Ah! Oh, Lord! He's here! Which means we're not. [echoing]: Now, now, why would you run from me? My only lot in life is to make all of your lives better. I am but a humble servant. -[crowd booing] -[thunder rumbling] Don't take my word. Listen to my two best friends. Mr. Burke, Mr. Hare. My good Irish friends, welcome back. What have you been up to? PUPPET HARE: Spending all me money on women and wine. -PUPPET KNOX: And I've given you a lot of money. -Mm-hmm. -BOTH: Thank you, Doctor. -Don't mention it. -I mean that. Don't mention it. -[thunder rumbling] PUPPET HARE: What about you, Billy? Are yougoing to mention it? PUPPET BURKE: Oh, imagine you did. -We'd both hang. -Or maybe that would be better. [echoing]: Then at least you could sleep. PUPPET KNOX: On my table. -[laughter] -[puppets laughing] PUPPET HARE: Good luck sleeping, Billy! PUPPET KNOX: Nighty night, Billy! [puppets laughing] -[lively music playing] -[sighs, sniffs] All hail the walking dead. Not tonight. Just let me drink. I'll buy you a drink. I'll buy you four. How 'bout you stop waving your, uh, money around? You think people haven't noticed your new coat? The fact that every meal is at a restaurant? The fact that you bedded half the whores in the city? Billy, I thought you were more worried about your own eternal soul. Who says I ain't? But you wouldn't know about that, would ya? -Listen... -No. No, no, no. You listen. You may not care about sin and damnation, -but you care about getting caught, don't ya? -Billy... You call me Billy again, and you'll be doing it without teeth. William, it's clear to me that you're in a foul mood, so I'm gonna let this one pass. But remember this: sin or not, it's all us getting caught, not just me. It's all us. Now who wants to play on my bagpipe?! ♪ ♪ Angus, all of Billy's drinks are on me. ♪ ♪ Hey. Listen. Hey. It's fine. You know... you know you're like a brother to me? Hmm? HARE: I said it's fine, mate.

[sputters] [sighs] [grunting] -BURKE: Oh, shit! -HARE: Jamie, Jamie! It's us! It's us! It's us! [grunting] Jamie! -[shouts] -[grunting] I'll tell... me mother! [Jamie grunting loudly] ♪ ♪ No! No! No! No! No. [grunting] [shouts] [panting] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Down. Up. [knocking] [sighs] Leave. [door closes] This is unacceptable. This body is... disfigured. A horror. It's almost worthless. I ask you to do one thing. Pristine. [sawing] [grunts] [sighs] I will dispose of the rest. These... pieces, get rid of them. [grunts] -[fabric tearing] -[grunting] Not even a shilling? Go. Yeah, okay. KNOX: And be careful. That head... will tend to prove the rumors I've been hearing about murderers walking the streets, if you can believe it. And I can't be a party to murder. Do we have an understanding? Aye. For science. Science. [insects chittering] Fancy a pint? Jesus Christ. I'm done. -[thunder rumbling softly] -[laughter] ♪ ♪ [laughter fades] PUPPET BURKE [echoing]: What's the matter, Billy? Cat got your tongue? Doctor got your foot?

She's in town, and, well, uh, it got me thinking. Family, friends, that's what matters. Right, that's great. No, no, no, no, no, no. William, come with me. -You know how awkward I can get. -You? [laughs] Right. But family's a different kind of beast, mate. Come have a drink with us. Just family. Come on. ♪ ♪ [chuckles] [Burke sighs] HARE: That's not the way to your flat. Well, the Grays are out of town. They asked me to keep an eye out. It's better than our dirty flops. Fine. [laughs] Cousin, meet my dearest friend, William Hare, of Londonderry. William, my cousin Margaret. -How do you do? -I... [sighs] -Pleasure. -BURKE: Speaking of, I come bearing drinks. -[sets bottle down] -Huh? Family. It's all we really have. Oh! Right. [sighs] I need some space for my bladder. So, uh... cousins, huh? -When was the last time ya... -Oh, well, to be perfectly honest, I can't quite place him. I only just arrived in Edinburgh two days ago, but he seemed so convinced and sweet, I felt maybe I was off. -Seemed convinced, did he? -Of our relation. I do see it in the eyes a bit. Oh, I see something, too. Clearly. Forgive me, Margaret. Seems nature is screaming my name as well. [panting] -You lying sack of shite! -Easy there, Billy. Wouldn't want Margaret to hear, now, would... [grunts] That's for calling me Billy, and for lying to me and pulling me back into your madness. -I told you I was done! -Now who's lying? William, you knew exactly where this little reunion would end. You like it. You just don't like that you like it. Stop! 16. 16 so far. Men, women, Jamie. -Stop. -It's me or her, Billy.

PUPPET BURKE: What do you mean, "not quite"? PUPPET HARE: Well, the thing is, Liam, I turned King's evidence. No. I confessed in exchange for immunity. They wanted to punish someone, so I made a deal. PUPPET BURKE: So what happened to you? PUPPET HARE: Nobody knows. But we all know what happened to you, William Burke. Yes. I was hanged by the neck until dead. Yeah. And then your fresh and mostly pristine corpse... -Oh, mostly pristine? -Well, you are Irish. Right, right. Carry on. Your corpse still exists today.
