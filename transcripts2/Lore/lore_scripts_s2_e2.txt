 Clumsy cow. Take care of it. Quickly. [bell rings] ♪ ♪ [door creaking] Lady Margit. A delight. It is my honor to serve you, Countess. My father sends his regards. Your castle is magnificent. The most extraordinary... ELIZABETH: Sweet girl, you've only just scratched the surface. Please forgive Sophi. This way. She's often clumsy. The castle was a wedding gift from my husband. We were married when I was about your age. We've all heard the tales. The most beautiful woman in Hungary and her brave Black Knight. Tales for you. It's life for me. Did that belong to the count? Yes. A war memento. For his people. He would do anything to protect them. Ah, be careful. You could get hurt. Ferenc was a true hero of our country. And he was all mine. He saved us from the Turkish hordes. -[neighing] -[thunder rumbles] The Black Knight of Hungary. He was mine. And I was his. Soul mates. [bell ringing] But what 10,000 Turkish swords couldn't do, disease did instead. [flies buzzing] Death took Ferenc from me, and reduced my life to ashes. MARGIT: She's far better than any tale. Her beauty, and that story. Everything. She certainly is charming. It's a dream. It is, yes. A sort of dream. It's mine? Provided you're fit to wear white. It's yours. [laughs softly] [exhales] Thank you, for bringing me here. Prepare her for supper. [door closes] [door closes] The new girl is lovely... and pure? Of course, my lady. So young, so fresh, so fair. But not the fairest. Let's keep it that way. A high-born girl. She's surely worth ten of those weak little peasants. And I fear their effect is diminishing. But they say us nobles have divinity in our blood, Ava. Divinity. Can you imagine the effect? I knew she'd please you. You always know what I need, Ava. That's what makes you so special. Hurry now. I'm late for supper. It's empty, my lady. I have one... simple rule. Never let it run out. ♪ ♪ You eat like a bird, Lady Margit. I'm so sorry. I'll have more. I hope I haven't offended you. Nonsense. Please enjoy. I insist. It's just... You want it to last? Yes, my lady. Those abominable Turks, pillaging others for their gain. The devastation they have wrought upon your family... The war's been hard on everyone, really. Indeed it has. But there's hope for a lovely high-born girl like yourself. You must have proposals of marriage? Or at least a few suitors at your door? I did have one. Lukas. But he wasn't of rank. With the casualties, the prospects for marriage are few. My poor sister, she was sent to a convent. A life devoted to God is admirable, but perhaps not preferable. I'm glad you accepted my invitation. As am I, Countess. Oh, your family must miss their sweet girl so far from home. Might they come steal you back? Oh, they wouldn't dream of it. They'll now have one less mouth to feed and as your lady in waiting, I give them hope for our name. Delightful, Vera. -Honey? -A treat. Ferenc loved his hounds and I love what he loves. MARGIT: Oh, your hand. Oh, Vera cut it in the kitchen last week. We're grateful she's all right. [dog barking, snarling] [laughs] Now, tell me, Lady Margit, what interests you most at the castle? -Perhaps the healing arts you offer. -Fear not. You will receive the highest training with frequent practice. There are several new treatments that I have learned about: herbal remedies and ointments for burns. Let's start with your health, my child. Have some more honey. It's good for the blood. MARGIT: I do miss my own room, my bed. Perhaps a book to help me sleep? You can read? Oh, yes. It's wonderful. I can teach you. Curfew, my lady. Of course. What is it? Forgive me, but nobles don't pay mind to servants. Honestly, I'm unsure how to speak to you. I'm noble in title only, the youngest of three girls. If anything, I'm the scullery maid of my household. [woman crying nearby] Did you hear that? Crying. We should go looking, see if they need help. We're high on the hill. It's just the wind in the trees. Lady Margit. -Rest? -Yes, ma'am, if you would. [crying continues] [door creaks closed] [woman crying] ♪ ♪ [woman screams] [woman crying] [woman shrieks] [woman shouts] WOMAN: Help! WOMAN [crying]: No! Please, no! No! [crying] ♪ ♪ [screams] No! [crying] Please help me. [crying]: No. No! [screams] [sobbing] [screaming, crying continues] No! Help! [gasps] Someone is hurt. [dogs barking] No! [shrieking] No! Please, no! You can't read, but you can write. I can draw the letters. You draw them beautifully. It's true, all the rumors. Which rumors are those? She really was the fairest in the kingdom. -As she is still. -Yes, in her way. I hope I age as well as she. Mind your task, my lady. We are to finish by noon. Rest. I can take those. [Margit gasps] It's just paper and ink. And blood, it seems. Let me help. You take the needle well. More from your skill than my constitution. My mother died when I was young. My sisters and I had to care for each other. I hope this doesn't scar, -you seem to have quite a few... -Enough. The countess comes first. -But what's happened to you? -Just my clumsiness. But so many of the girls here, they're wounded. And the sounds I've heard... What is done to you? Please, Lady Margit, we are here to serve. You need to take care of yourself as well. If you fall ill, then what? Then someone else will care for you. That is not my concern. I worry for you, not who shall be my next guardian. -We have work. -And I'm almost finished. AVA: It's nothing. This wound, it's infected. You need a proper doctor, and I will find you one. -The countess won't approve. -We don't have a choice. Margit, no. You must trust me. I've seen this before. My mother, she cut her leg in the garden. She, too, said it was nothing. Within a week, she was gone. I won't let that happen to you. ELIZABETH: How helpless you are. How weak. But you fight. You'll never fly again, never sing again. And yet still you struggle, as though you might yet take wing. As though death is just a dream, banished in the waking. MARGIT: Countess? Lady Margit. Forgive the intrusion, my lady. Show her. -The wound is... -ELIZABETH: Infected. -Yes, I can see. -The color turns. And her temperature, it's rising. A doctor may be summoned. Thank you. You see? And that little thing? -Leave it. -I could perhaps repair her wing. I know how to. There are many sparrows in the sky, but this one? Death brought this one to my door. It cannot be saved. Thank you, Lady Margit. Your attention to small things does not go unnoticed, or unappreciated. -Ava. -I'll be along, my lady. [door closes] Take care of the foolish creature. [bird chitters] Forgive me, but Lady Margit, she's not like the peasant girls. That's precisely why you brought her to me. And now, her time has come. But she'll be missed. She'll be missed, Countess. There are many sparrows, but there is only one Margit. Do you need help? A partner at the very end. [scoffs] Where is your head, Ava? I need my remedy, now. This peasant drivel is useless. You heard the girl say it herself. I am aging. -I'll find another noble. -You will not! There is no time! If I don't take her blood, her beauty, her youth... Then I will fade. It's happened before. When Ferenc died, I became weak. All that he loved about me, everything that I was, faded. I thought perhaps it best to join him in death. But then you appeared... ...and hurt me. In my rage, I hurt you back. But when your essence hit my skin, as my youth flooded back to me, I realized you hadn't hurt me. You'd brought me back to life. Don't you ever forget, Ava, the girls, the blood... it all began with you. Prepare your noble... ...or prepare yourself. [wind whistling] [gasps] [gasping continues] She's still breathing. Get her to the infirmary. And don't tell the countess. AVA: What are you doing out past curfew? I-I couldn't sleep. What's happened? Sophi, she snuck out of the castle and was attacked by a wild animal. Wolves, I think. I-I can help her. Please, my lady, you've helped enough. There's something going on in this castle. Ava, please, y-you can tell me. Stop asking questions. Please. [Sophi groans] [breathing heavily] How can you keep helping her? It's my job, Sophi. What choice do I have? [muffled gasp] Come with me. MARGIT: Ava, stop. What's happening? It's not the wind, and it's not the wolves. It's the countess. Whatever I've done, let me speak to her. Listen. Be silent, and allow me to save your life. Or I can lead you to your death and save my own-- which will it be? This can't be so, Ava. -Do you want to live? -Yes. ♪ ♪ Where are we going? I'm helping you escape. Oh... Come with me, or you're next. It's the only way out. There's only one direction. She's close. We have to keep going. MARGIT: We have to help her. AVA: You will, by leaving, by telling your father all you've seen here. A noble's voice will be heard. You came to my home, convinced me to come here. You're one of them. -I'm trying to help you. -I trusted you. And you must again, or we are both dead. You helped torture these girls. Yes. And now me. I couldn't help them... but you can. No, stop! It's not that way! You should really do as you're told. Ava, I'm sorry. [panting] [moaning softly] [whimpering] Little Margit... you came to serve me. And now you shall. [whimpering] Your noble blood. But it's not just that. It's rather how it comes to me. The light slowly leaking from your eyes... It's powerful. Your pain pleasures me, fuels me. [whimpering] It keeps me invincible. [door closes] ELIZABETH: Over 600 dead, "taken by cholera," and not a single question. But who would question me when there are rumors? For there are always rumors. My servants would not betray me. They know their fate if they do. Ava knew hers from the very beginning. [metallic snap] [whimpering] [Elizabeth exhales] [Margit gasping] [sobbing] Ava was my favorite. Shame she was a traitor. [whimpering] [Elizabeth chuckles] ELIZABETH: The king would never listen. Not without my witness to guide him. And I would not confess. [whimpers] I am safe. But you... Poor little bird. [muffled cries] Not yet. [squeals] Not yet. [Margit crying] Your essence is glorious. [sighs] Thank you, little Margit. You're my first noble. So young and beautiful, forever. [pounding on door] ELIZABETH: 300 witnesses claimed that I'd killed so many peasants. But only the death of a noble forced King Matthias to investigate. But the fool wouldn't have me killed. He walled me inside my chambers... forever. It's been four years. And I think I'm getting nearer to you, dearest Ferenc. So very near. I only wish I could be as beautiful as I was... when I greet you again. ♪ ♪ [sobbing]
