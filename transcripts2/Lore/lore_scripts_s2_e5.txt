 VERITY: It is said that Mary Webster was born in England, but I believe that she crawled her way out from Hell. Since I was a child, I have heard stories of her covenant with the Devil. She curses all those around her, even my sweet mother, taking her from me. Our most godly mayor, Philip Smith, sent her for trial in Northampton, but the cowards were too afraid to convict her of witchcraft. They sent her away to Boston. But Satan ruled that court as well. And now she is back in Hadley. Mary Webster,

 the witch, is back. Dear Lord, help me survive another night. [door creaks] Son. Can you not see his thirst? Fetch him some ale. Son, you look as if you've seen the Devil himself. I came from the Bostock farm. A cow was to calve, so I went to give aid. [sighs] But it was a breech. Born cold and dead. It is an ill omen. This morning Mary Webster was seen near the paddock. That blight... blighted woman is back from Boston? How? How? I got word that she was acquitted. Boston. Godless city. They care more for their carriages and their fine clothing than their... s-souls and their safety. Can they see through their foolish eyes that a witch curses everything she touches? [shattering] She touched me. Child... you tell me what you know about Mary Webster. [knocking at door] Hello? [knocking continues] You lost this on your visit last night. Have you come to seek your revenge? My brother's not far. I'll scream, and he'll come. You're a stupid girl, aren't you? As dull and befuddled as everyone else in this town. I thought this was important to you, the way you flailed after it last night. My mother made it for me. Before you cursed her. Do you think I don't have other matters to attend? Take it, girl. [footfalls approaching] What are you doing? Is that Mother's cloak? The witch was wearing it. Goody Webster was here? You must have scared her off. That is Mother's. I remember the color. Did the witch steal this after she killed her? Verity, Mother was sick for many years. Yes. So why did she suddenly die a day after I saw her talking to that witch? Do you really think that an old woman -can have so much power? -I think that woman can. Don't let your head be as soft as your heart, Levi. Watch your quick tongue. Yes, I've heard the rumors. But I don't pay mind to idle talk. "Idle talk." Last year the Byfield boy was trampled by cattle as the witch walked past. And when the witch walked through our field, the crop died. And on moonless nights, the witch takes the form of a black cat with imps suckling her many teats. Paradise Lost? I don't think you need Mother's books to inflame that imagination of yours. -I wasn't finished with that. -Nor with this. There is no time for flights of fantasy. Mr. Smith wants to see you. I'm supposed to finish my chores. Please, Verity-- I don't want his temper turned on me. If you are my true friend, you will come. [Verity sighs] The blight from your fields has found mine, Levi Hollister. How do you fare, Mr. Smith? The Lord has given me better days. But, then, this is not His work. This past night you spied on Mary Webster at her home? What evil did you witness there? The witch was outside, -with fire and smoke... -Yes. -Yes, and what was she doing? -She was summoning a demon. There was a hole in the earth that was open to Hell. Good girl, Amy. What else? She was... performing dark magic. -Was speaking in a demonic language. -We stole inside her hovel and took a book. A spell book. VERITY: But it fell when we ran from her. Was my name... on the witch's tongue? Tell me the truth, Miss Hollister-- did she speak my name? Yes. As I was running away, she shouted after me, "Tell Philip Smith he is cursed by Satan himself. -The Devil will have his soul." -I knew it. She's cursed me. This fever is not natural. -That witch has hexed me! -Shh, shh, shh. Child, why is that cross crooked? It broke last night. Come here quickly and let me see that cross. -You did this? -No. The witch brought it back to me. She fixed it. No. Girl, my child, this is a corrupted thing. Get it off! It's an abomination! [flames whoosh] An abomination! We should fetch the doctor. This fever will kill him. Hush, woman! This is not an illness a doctor can cure. [Josias pants] Get me Mary Webster. Get me that witch. [birds chirping] LEVI: Get the rope and gather the men. We'll hang that witch. What are you doing, Levi? This is murder. I have to do this. If our crops fail again, we'll need Mr. Smith's charity to survive. [sniffing] "Mary, "the love of God warms our hearts, "but a cloak warms our backs. "I hope this will ease your bones this winter. "His humble servant, Katherine Hollister." Oh, Mother... what have I done? ♪ ♪ [knocking] VERITY: Hello? [door creaking] Hello? Have you come to steal something else? [cat meows] I've come to give you a warning. How very Christian of you. Men are coming here. Let them come. -No, they intend to... -To what? Send me back to Boston... for another ridiculous trial? Make yourself useful, girl-- open that brandy for me. They want to end the curse you put on Mr. Smith. The blackness in his heart should have killed him -years ago. -You're not listening. We fear men so much, because we fear God so little. You don't understand. They mean to kill you. What would you have me do? Turn into a beast? Flee into the woods? I won't be driven from my home. [whispers]: Not again. It is all I have in this world. Please, can you listen to... Why do you care?! My mother. She showed me charity... when no other in this wicked town would. Then why did you return her cloak? Your family's kindness died with her. [horses approaching] You need to leave. You can't be seen communing with a witch. I can speak some sense to my brother. There is no sense! Only fear and ignorance! -[horse neighs] -And that fear needs a face. Go! Go, child. Go now. This is my fault, and witch or not, -murder is a sin. -JOSIAS: Witch! We have come for a reckoning! [pounding on door] Show yourself, witch. She's not here. She must have left on her own. RICHARD: Or she's taken another form, escaped. [shattering] You are holding a cursed thing. [gasps] Towards the barn! She ran out the back. ♪ ♪ [footfalls approaching] Levi! She's here! -The witch is here! -[whimpers] Aah! Aah! [Mary shouting, groaning] -Ready. -Pull! [grunting] Witch, you're going to dance upon nothing. [man spits] ♪ ♪ PHILIP: You have been found guilty of the sin of witchcraft, but still you proclaim your innocence. Let the weight of these rocks represent the weight of your sins against God. What say you now, Verity Hollister? [gasps] I am not a witch. PHILIP [echoing]: Verity Hollister. [echoing]: You have been accused of the sin of witchcraft. Confess yourself before these righteous men here present or confess yourself before God and may He save your soul. [echoing]: I am not a witch! PHILIP: Verity Hollister, you have been found guilty of the sin of witchcraft. VERITY [echoing]: I am not a witch! I am not a witch. [shouting] [screaming] Aah! I am not a witch! [screams] -Verity. Verity. -I'm not a witch. What are you saying? What were you doing in the woods yesterday? Willful girl. You killed her. No. I killed her. -I am the murderer. -No. No, you are not. Perhaps you were right before. After the hanging, Mr. Smith's seizures stopped. Go and take him some nourishment. Prove to him what a pious Christian you are... because now that the witch is gone, they'll be looking for someone new to blame. Just go and pray with him. He will see your godliness and all will be well. PHILIP: The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all. Evil will slay the wicked. The foes of the righteous will be condemned. The Lord will rescue his servants. No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned. [door creaks] [cat meows] Paradise Lost. The holy book. "Praise be to the God and Father "of our Lord Jesus Christ, "the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, "who comforts us in all our troubles, "so that we can comfort those in any trouble "with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. "Please, Lord, guide this woman's soul to heaven on a feather. Shall the Lord..." ♪ ♪ [ghostly whisper] [knocking] I brought mutton stew for Mr. Philip's health. PHILIP: Let her in, Josias. It has gone cold. You have come to pray for my recovery? Your brother stayed with me all through last night. On his knees in supplication. But you are too late. The curse has been lifted. I am healed. Now, we shall thank God. Yes, of course. But I stopped first to offer another prayer. For even a witch deserves the Lord's mercy. But there was no one to pray over. What do you mean? What did you do with Mary Webster's body? [Amy screams] I swear by everything that is holy that she was dead. The Devil has brought her back. [pounding on door] MARY: Philip Smith. Open the door, you coward! [crying]: See with your own eyes what your fear has done to an old woman. [pounding on door] Mary Webster lives. MARY: You will have a reckoning! -Mary Webster lives. -God will judge you, and you will fall short! Mary Webster lives. Mary... [panting] [coughing, retching] What have we done? What have we done? ♪ ♪ Levi! Levi! Help me get her up. She's just a poor woman who needs our help. Will you turn your back on her? Will you all? Turn your back on God then. Call yourself Christians; you still do the Devil's work. I was not a witch. I was not a witch. I was not a witch! VERITY: Even now, years past, I often lay awake, imagining what that night was like for Mary, after my coward legs had borne me away. Hanging, alone, life leaving in small gasps, believing that God, too, had fled. Perhaps He hadn't. Perhaps it was His hands that tore the rope. [rope snaps, body drops] [ethereal singing] But now, ten years later, I wonder where God was while evil swept through the village of Salem. [singing continues] Did He watch while 13 women and six men were killed? ♪ ♪ I can only wonder if God deemed them less worthy than Mary Webster? ♪ ♪ Or perhaps, that night, it wasn't His hand that sundered that rope. Perhaps it was only Mary's. MARY [echoing]: I was not a witch! ♪ ♪ [horse neighs]
