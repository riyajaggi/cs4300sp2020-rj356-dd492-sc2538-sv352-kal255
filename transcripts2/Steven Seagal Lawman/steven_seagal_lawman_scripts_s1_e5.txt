We're trying to hit all of the main troubled areas as thoroughly and as quickly as we can to just make this as safe as we can. >> disturbance with a gun. >> man with a gun with dreadlocks, and it's a fight. >> it's a 103 95-G, and they hear arguing in the background. Alex says we can get there pretty quick. >> come on now, Johnny. Get 'em. We've got a suspect who's threatening people with a gun. If you see a white Jeep, we stop it. >> come on, silver. Get up. >> is that it? Ain't that him? >> yep. >> get him, Johnny. >> we got him right here. Right here. >> 17, we got the vehicle stopped. >> get out the car. Turn around here. Right there. Don't move. >> all right, we do have a subject. He's supposed to have a white t-shirt, black pants, and dreads. >> that's him there, dreadlocks. >> yep. Dreadlocks. >> say, man, y'all just left A little fight or something over there? >> put your hands up there. >> no, put your hands up there. >> where you put the gun, man? My years of studying martial arts and my years of being a police officer have given me a real good sense of who's hiding something. Where you put the gun, cuz? The gun gotta be there. It could be just a look, the way they look away. I need to find that gun. So I think this guy is hiding something, and I plan to find out what it is. There it is. >> there's a gun right here. Got the gun back here. >> it's a .44 magnum. >> well, who's got the gun? >> that's my gun, sir. >> thank you. >> where did you get it from? >> did you buy it off the street, or you bought it from a dealership? >> mama, what is that? I'm asking you, what is that, mama? >> okay. Okay. >> there was several different occupants inside the car, Two males, two females. An elderly lady was driving. And like I said, the subject that was in the backseat Is actually claiming ownership to this firearm. >> you shot it tonight? >> no, I didn't shoot it, sir. >> what the caliber on it? >> uh, that's a .44. >> .44. >> he says he threw the weapon in the back of the car When he saw the lights behind him. Luckily, he decided to throw it in the car and not engage the police. >> you know, he left that gun cocked back like that. And, man, if that got a hair trigger, it could go off right now. That .44 magnum is a dangerous pistol. It was left in the back with the hammer back. The car could just be bumped, and it could go off. I got gloves. Be careful, 'cause that thing could have a hair trigger. The first thing you got to do is hold the hammer, brother. Hold the hammer. Okay, now let it go slowly. Okay, there you go. Now we're safe. Good job. Just like that. .44 magnum hollow points. When, you know, you have a disturbance where somebody's threatening somebody with a gun, it's a dangerous situation. >> so what's this about you pointing the gun at him? >> no, I ain't never pointed the gun--that's my cousin. I didn't never do that to my cousin. >> well, your cousin called saying you pointed the gun at him. >> he called? >> why you think we stopped you? When was the last time you've been arrested? >> I ain't never been arrested. This is my first time going to jail. >> the person called up and said that the guy pulled a gun out on him, that he just left the scene in a white Jeep. And he admitted to us that he threw the gun in the back when he saw the police behind him. If he'd have thrown that gun in the backseat and it would have went off, it would have went through the seat and through several people, because that's a very powerful gun. Nobody got hurt, and we're thankful because of that, But we still have to do our jobs. >> he's probably gonna be charged with illegal use of a firearm. >> good stop. >> yeah. >> that was a good stop. >> and I knew the gun was in the car. I kept saying, "where's the gun? where's the gun?" >> we were close. We got him. >> yeah. >> we got him. >> yeah. I'm not happy that this happened, but, you know, at least we got one more gun off the street and the people who are being threatened are Safe for the moment. >> what do you say, guys? We done here? >> Johnny. Let's roll. ? ? >> go get it. >> he's conscious, breathing, and alert but losing blood. Shot in the back. >> whoa. That's bad news. >> somebody's shot on Helen. >> he's conscious, breathing, and alert but losing blood. Shot in the back. >> whoa. That's bad news. >> we're en route over there to see if we can assist in finding the subject that shot him. >> a lot of units here already, boy. Listen to me. Can you feel your feet? Brother, can you feel your legs? >> this young individual was standing on a corner. A car pulled up. The suspect jumped out with a shotgun and shot him at close range. >> why don't you tell me the dude's name that did this? If you don't want to go forward with charges, you don't have to; you hear me? What--what they call him on the street? >> I sure wish you would tell me the guy's name. I feel quite certain that he saw the guy who shot him, but he's not talking. >> >> that's a dirty mother to shoot you in the back. Do you hear me? A dirty mother who'd do like that. Let me tell you something, bro. If it's a light load, like a bird shot load, you're gonna be fine, ya hear? And it doesn't like double-ought buck or slug or anything like that. Ya hear me? Strap him in. >> how old are you, man? >> That's bird. Bird, or he wouldn't be here. He'd be dead. Let me tell you something, It's bird. And it was right, right in his spine. That's why I kept asking him if he could feel his feet. >> let's go. Let's go. So I guess the detectives will be taking over from here on in. If this young man knows who shot him, I really hope he'll talk about it and tell us who did it so we can get this shooter off the street. Between you and I, man, that was almost a point-blank gunshot. If that's a shotgun, it didn't have any time to spread. that was within 2 feet. or less. Someone was trying to kill him, for sure. >> a lot of times, we see people that have more respect for the streets than they do for themselves. >> I mean, they got guys' dying declarations don't identify their assailants. >> it's a shame. >> last night, we stopped a guy in a Jeep with a loaded .44 cocked and ready to go. You just never know what you're gonna meet out on the street. Sometimes you have to make split-second decisions that could make the difference between life and death. So I'm just bringing everybody over to the range right now to see if I can sharpen their skills a little bit. >> get out the car. >> this particular system is a firearms training simulator. >> put your hands up in the air so I can see 'em. Step back. Slowly. Get down on your knees. >> man, he dead. Let's see where they landed, Jeff. >> all right, sir. >> this is a real-life scenario. But it's computerized. They kind of put you in situations Where you really don't know what to expect. >> all right. Lethal hit. >> so I got in two lethal hits. And I'm gonna say this again. I'm number one, right? >> you're number one. >> yes. Yeah, and number one did some-- a little bit better. >> I got the man right here one time. >> yeah, one time maybe. >> watch when you get up here. You won't be able to tell the difference. >> this system is really, for us, the closest to reality we could get. Even though it's a game to us, it's not a game. >> you're on stakeout at an automatic teller machine. >> it's something where you actually feel like you're involved in the situation. Drop your gun! And it puts you in the middle. Your adrenaline starts flowing. Step out from behind the car. Drop your weapon! Step away from the vehicle. Police. >> let me see your hands. >> there's no such thing as too much training. >> that's good work, partner. Thank you. >> the more you train, the more proficient you become, the more chance you have of saving your own life, the life of your fellow officers, life of innocent people. >> let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. Put 'em on the car. Put 'em on the car! >> take the left. I got the right. This is the quintessential exercise In teaching officers how to not get confused and to know when to shoot and when not to shoot. >> got one in the backseat. Watch his hands. Watch his hands. Let's give chase. >> that was rough. That was a no-shoot scenario. I think this is the most helpful stuff there is. God forbid, we get into any kind of situation, you know, this is the kind of training that really builds your foundation. >> it's good a spot as any to go left or right, east or west. Last night, we sat here. Every time we come here, there's always something that happens around here. >> we get a lot of armed robberies, a lot of stolen vehicles. Usually it's close to here, so we can go left or right, and north, south, east, west from here pretty quickly. Right, John? >> mm-hmm. >> what the is that guy doing, man? >> is he doing donuts? >> right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. >> he's over on this side of the building. >> behind the building? >> yeah. Stop the car. >> now. >> get off the phone. >> over there. >> he don't give a what you say. >> stop your car.

What do you think he gonna do? >> we believed you were going to get that weapon to harm us. >> but I was scared, and I told y'all I had a gun 'cause I was scared. >> you don't-- you do this: You put your hands on the steering wheel, and you say, "I have a gun." >> you got five of us standing out here. Somebody could have shot you. >> but... >> >> we saw him tearing up out there, and I thought, "man, something crazy going on." And I said, "get out the car."

Listen to me But that's Steven Seagal. >> when the motor's acting up, you turn the key off. Everything will cut off. I'm sorry, but... But I was trying to pull that carpet from under that pedal. >> we don't know that. All you had to do is turn the motor off. You come that close to getting shot. He could have been killed right here. but because we're good officers and we gave him a chance to get out that vehicle and we pulled him out that vehicle, That man's living today right now. >> so did we. On the real. >> we're showing one prior... >> this guy's gun is legal, But he's wanted for traffic violations, so he's gonna ride. >> watch your head, okay? >> the guy resists arrest. He screams out, "I've got a gun," and he reaches for it.
