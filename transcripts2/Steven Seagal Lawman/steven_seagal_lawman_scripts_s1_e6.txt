About a year ago, our beloved Sheriff lost his battle to leukemia. And it's really left a great void. He was our boss for a long, long time. Damn. And it's really left a great void. How y'all doing? How da neighborhood? What's going on, cuz? This is the easy part of the job. And being a police officer is not about getting the bad guy as much as being a friend to the good guy. >> how y'all been today? >> what's going on, children? >> y'all know this man? >> Steve! >> oh, Steven Seagal! >> hey, how's it going? >> I want a autograph. >> he wants to say hello to y'all. >> now, that's a sexy man. >> all right. >> Steven Seagal! Where he at, where he at, yo? >> where he's at? Right here. >> hey! >> there you go. >> 80% of what Harry Lee and I did together was go out there and be a friend to the community. >> good to meet you. >> how you doing? >> oh, you're Steven Seagal. >> that's right, that's right. >> oh, man. >> way back in the days when Sheriff Harry Lee first became sheriff, that was one of his primary objectives, was to make certain that we could open the lines of communication with everyone in the community. >> everything cool? >> yeah. >> we often come back in some of these neighborhoods that we know are crime-ridden neighborhoods and let them know that we're out here to help. >> what you gonna be when you grow up? You have no idea? It ain't too early to start planning, you know. Mechanic? All right, I'm a look you up. You gonna give me a discount? >> I'll give you $5 if you can outrun him. >> tell him to give you $5. >> he's big and fat, though. Look at him.

We can learn intelligence from the neighborhood And just let people know, "hey, we're the police, But we're people too." And we just want to do our job and make sure that nobody gets hurt. >> well, who the best basketball player? >> me. >> you the best? >> a'ight, who the best singer? >> me. >> so out here bonding with the community helps build the trust between them and us, And it also makes it feel like we're keeping Harry's legacy alive. Lots of love, you hear? Y'all be cool, be safe, you hear? >> all right, for sure. >> all right, man. >> all right, thank you. >> I think Harry Lee would have patted me and my whole team On the back and said, "y'all doing good." Stay out of trouble. >> I will. >> be happy. >> I am. >> all right. >> let's roll, gang. >> time to get back to work, y'all. >> hold up, hold up, we got a flag-down. >> is this guy still in the house? Alex, get me and ambulance. >> hold up, hold up, we got a flag-down. >> is this guy still in the house? Where'd she go? Okay. >> is he hurt bad? Get me an ambulance. So just tell him that the ambulance is coming, okay? >> where's the suspect? >> over here. >> when the units arrived on the scene, The lady pointed this guy out as the one that beating the hell out of her husband. What, he drunk? >> yeah, he's drunk. He can't even walk. >> he's intoxicated, uh, some narcotic, I don't know. But it looks like alcohol. he's been drinking. >> just drunk? That's what they're saying. >> what we have so far is a spanish female who seems to be claiming that another spanish male broke into her house and beat up her husband. >> do you know what he's saying? >> but we're gonna have to wait until an interpreter gets here So we can actually figure out what happened. >> what, they broke the glass? >> yeah. Oh, boy. >> what'd he just kick the door open? I mean, what's the deal here? >> >> she said she was sleeping in the back, and he banged the door in and came in. >> the interpreter says the suspect is a friend of a roommate that's living in the apartment. >> apparently, the suspect was playing a stereo too loud, so the woman got up, turned the stereo off, and when she went back to bed, the suspect allegedly retaliated by beating on her husband. >> it was this guy's probably quite intoxicated, yeah? >> well, this is exactly the reason why we're out here. when there's conflict or somebody needs our help, somebody's been beaten up, somebody's been robbed. we want to be there to help them, and that's the same thing Harry Lee did, and it's the same thing we want to do. >> good job, Mark. Good man for the team. All right, big chief, you ready to roll? See y'all at the next one. >> Harry was everything to us. I mean, he was like family to us. And out of respect to him, one of the things that we try to do is Stay in close touch with the two most important women in his life, Lai, his wife, and Cynthia, his daughter. Harry Lee's wife, she's the closest thing to our boss that we got now. Ooh, on a hot day like today, these flowers not gonna last long. >> oh, they're beautiful. >> when I come here to Harry's grave, I really miss him. He was an inspiration for me. And coming here to his grave and remembering him, it always inspires me to try to be a better human being, to be a better police officer, and, uh, really make him proud. We're still here, boss. We're still here. You got the good days, and you got the bad days. It's best to stay busy. >> yeah. >> and that way, the bad days don't get so bad. >> yeah. >> so I called him two days before he died. "how you feeling?" he said, "oh, I'm feeling good." And then I said, "well, I'm coming down in about A week again" and he said, "I'll be waiting for you." >> yeah. >> he was always grateful for you, because I know you went to visit him and sat in the backyard with him all Sunday. >> well, it gave him an uplift, you know? >> yeah, you were a very good friend to him. >> when I first joined the force, Sheriff Lee became my mentor, taught me Many, many things about being a police officer. Became not only a mentor, but like a father to me. >> this is a picture of his last day. And he was fishing with my son. This is the last photograph taken of him. >> it's amazing, huh? Fishing the day before he died, How good is that? >> yep. >> doesn't get better than that. >> yep, and that's the way he would have wanted to go out. >> hey, y'all, let's take a left up here. We're gonna check out that spot. >> well, we got some intel that there's a lot of drug slinging at this location. >> we also heard at roll call there's a house over there that's known for prostitution. >> and we're just heading over there to see if we can do a little proactive police work. >> hang back for one second. Pull in next door there; he's hopping the fence. >> get him. I got the two out front. Hands on the car. >> watch the dogs! Get back, get back. Get him! Get him! >> get down! Get down! >> pull in next door there; he's hopping the fence. >> get him; I got the two out front. Hands on the car. >> sheriff's office, stop. >> watch the dogs! >> we got him right here. Get him! Get him! >> get back! Get back, get back! >> down! Down! >> get back in the house! >> put your hands behind your back. Don't move. >> go back inside, baby. >> get your dogs. We got to check all of them. We got information earlier, just after roll call, that there was possibly some drug dealing going on right here, and as we came down the street, we saw one subject take off running. We caught him in the backyard, so now we're just doing a little preliminary to find out what he was running for, who he is, and who these other two are here. >> you know, you pockets is thick, man. You don't mind if I take a look? >> 1152, 1199. Need you to run one for me, please, in the system. >> he came up, and he saw us. He ran. Alex went out this way. I told johnny to go around So I could head him off at the pass. And sure enough, he jumped the fence, and he saw me coming, and he just dove down, and then I got on top of him and cuffed him. >> we're gonna have to look for a while, because he could have... >> threw something. >> he might have even had a gun on him, threw it in the grass here somewhere. >> that's possible. >> did you hear that? I think somebody's in the trailer. >> Sheriff's Office. Open the door, or I'm gonna kick it in. >> >> who? Who's in there with you? You by yourself? >> yeah, yeah. >> all right. You stay in there. >> all right. >> stay in there. I know you. >> what you running from, partner? >> of what? >> I ain't know what... >> the police? >> yeah, we look like bad guys, huh? >> are we gonna find anything back there? >> no, sir. No, sir. >> you smoked it already. >> all right, all right, just calm down. It's gonna be a'ight. These two guys were with the other guys who took off running. We just gonna run name checks on them, make sure they clear, don't have any outstanding attachments or warrants. >> well, who were you seeing here at this house? >> what you was doing in here? >> you came to get some what? >> a girl. >> a girl? >> pick her up? >> oh, she was gonna hook you up? >> okay, how about you, fella? What you was doing? Oh, y'all was gonna hook up together? He's homeless, this guy here. He's from Arkansas. He live pillar to post. Say he ran 'cause he's scared. >> you know, but everybody don't believe that, but... I actually believe it. He admitted it. He said, "man, I went in the house. "I smoked the crack that I had the money for, "finished, and I was just leaving when I saw y'all. "and naturally, somebody like myself would run when you guys are trying to get up on me." Now, Johnny has a different opinion, Said, "man, you know, he's not wanted, and why would he run from us?" >> nothing on him. >> on him? >> yeah. >> all right, let's go. >> we searched the area. we were unable to find any weapons, any contraband, or anything like that. Ran a records check on him. he cleared, as well as the other two guys. Sent them on their way, and we're back on the street. >> you ain't holding nothing, and you ain't wanted. There no reason to run. You get yourself hurt, or somebody hurt. >> save yourself a lot of trouble. >> investigation revealed that he was not wanted for anything. He said he was scared, but he did admit to smoking some type of narcotics prior to us arrival. Can't charge him with that. >> you look like you're about to pass out. >> yeah, I'm about to pass out. I'm pissed because we didn't get nothing. >> well, he finished smoking it already. >> all that trouble, and we didn't get nothing. >> today we're officially inducting our new sheriff, Newell Normand. Harry Lee, unfortunately, died during his term, and so Newell had to assume his position. We all get to officially welcome him as our new sheriff. And it's a good day. Just fix everything perfect here. >> thank you. Beautiful. >> that's my boss, the man, right there. >> and I was at Indianapolis last night, received an award... >> wow. >> that was given to the Sheriff posthumously. Uh, standing ovation, over 1,000 people. It was phenomenal. >> good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Colonel John Fortunato, and I'd like to welcome you this morning to the inauguration ceremony of Sheriff Mewell Normand. >> Harry Lee was very fond of Newell Normand and knew that by virtue of his personality and his character that he would be the perfect guy to take over. >> so help me God. >> so help me God. >> congratulations. >> and you know, this was a great moment for all of us, to see that Newell respects Harry as much as he does and loves and respects the position in law enforcement. >> I have never been more proud than I am today. Nine months ago, I lost a friend and a mentor and a father figure. I know that he's looking down today. And there is a sense of pride in not only me, but in each and every one of you. Thank you so much for being here today and sharing this experience with me. >> me and my team and our new sheriff, I think we'll be able to carry on the flame that Harry Kee has always carried and make Harry proud of us. -- Sync, corrections -- -- by elderman -- -- for addic7ed.com --
