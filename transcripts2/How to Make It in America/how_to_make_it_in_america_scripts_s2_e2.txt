So do you rep any other streetwear designers? To be honest, no. But my family's been in this business for five generations, And the one thing I can do is sell. I've been hawking work uniforms since I'm 13. Can you imagine what I would do With something as special as crisp? Come on, andy, don't bullshit. Look, I know I'm not one of these showrooms downtown In a cool loft, with a hot-ass sitting at reception. But together we can grow into a loft downtown With an army full of hot ass receptionists. ( chuckles ) can you get us into barney's? If that's where you want to be, I'll call every day until we get a meeting. So you don't know any buyers there? He's obsessed with barney's 'cause he used to work there - And now he wants validation. - Ignore him. It's cool. It's cool. I'd be the same way. Point blank, the challenge in working with me Is that I don't know all the buyers in that world yet. But there's value in being the new kid on the block. And when I do connect, I'll have only one brand I'm selling. I will eat, sleep, live and die crisp. Guys, come on. At least give me a shot. Let me prove myself. That's fair, right? All right, yeah.

Well, tell me this, rachel chapman: Why exactly should I hire you When you've already admitted to not reading "biscuit" And not being perfect? This is how I see it: Personally I love to cook. - I crafting-- I'm coming - ayaround on that. But I have an apartment With a kitchen that's seven square feet. So I feel like I represent a generation of young women Who at this point in their lives can only dream Of juggling career and family With baking the perfect red velvet ccake, for instance.

Suddenly you've got a few million eyeballs All over the country, even the world, Checking you out. Viral? And-- and the best part-- You never pay for it, not a penny. Well, I mean there's the cost of producing the videos And agency fees, of course. I hate fees, kevin. Of course, rene, but it's still Crazy cheap compared to a tv buy. That's true. That's true. Your biggest cost is reall onsoring the athlete. Is that expensive? It just depends on who you get. You know, should be around $50,000. To ride a skateboard? Yeah, there's a certain level of expertise That goes along with it. The dude's risking his life for you. I'm sorry. Well, I'm-- I'm gonna think about it. I want to thank you guys for your time.

So let me get this straight: You want to drive weed around in your little rasta escalade here. That'd be perfect. We'd be like the ice cream truck. You know, like, "hey, copper, come get your chronic." No no no, it won't be like that. We'll be doing legitimate business, rollg deep cover. What do you think? Aww, look at the puppy. I want a puppy. What's up, stace baby? How are you doing? - Exhausted. - Yeah? But my boyfriend's taking me to puerto rico for the long weekend, So that's my light at the end of the tunnel.

Then I will get them out for you to peruse. - Okay. - All right? What do you mean, lulu's not coming? Some problem about not getting a ride back from the hamptons. She's stuck out there for the night. - Are you kidding me? - I wonder if she's got a man out there. Cam, we lost our sales rep to come here. Now we can't even go in. Why can't we? We're not going rogue into somebody's house. That's weird. We're not gonna know anybody. We're here. We've got our samples. Not everybody's gonna know everybody. I bet you there'll be 100 people there. They won't even notice. ( quiet sic playing ) - May I take your bag? - Oh, sure. - Keep that on us. - We'll just keep this with us. ( exhales ) What do we do now? Uh, let's go for food. I see oysters. Hello. ( chuckles ) when I bartended at balthazar, I used to abuse the employee discount at the raw bar. They used to call me muther shucker. Yeah, then they fired you a week after you started. Whatever. I hated that job anyway. And now that I got the job, I'm like, "whoa, you know, What prison sentence Did I just sign myself up for?" Nah nah, you should be proud, okay? You nailed the interview. Yeah, but I always nail the interview. I love getting the job. Well, good luck. - Come on, get up. - Where are we going? We are gonna get you out in the fresh air Before you're cooped up in that Air-conditioned cage later on, all right? Plus rufus has to pee. Nightlife was great for fashion in those days. You didn't have, like, a sartorialist telling you what to do. It was five clubs and everybody went, Like blondie and sprouse and nancy. Straight off the l.I.R.R., thank you. This was, like, 1987 or something. I wish we could have been there. Yeah, but we would have been five, so that's a little weird. Thank you. Thank you very much. Anyway, look at her now. She's just the picture of fashion, right? And she kills those buyers. Did you notice? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was nancy Who brought the first pair of $100 jeans To the United States. And now look, okay? Can you stop with the jeans, please? Stop with the jeans. Bye. Stop worrying. I'll take care of it. Go have fun. - Hi. - Hello. Who are you? I'm-- I'm ben epstein. - Who brought you? - Lulu di florio. Oh really? I didn't see her. Yeah yeah, she's not here. She's in the hamptons, stuck. But we have some of our stuff in her store.

Nice meeting you. Oh, look who's here. Stefan. Hi. Oh, how was como? Freezing, but berlin was genius. I'll bet. I want to hear everything. ( laughs ) stop it. ( panting ) And I mean that sort of like left me out there in the world Thinking, "would have I even been a banjo prodigy?" - Oh shit. - What? Look at this-- a single glove. Every time I see one alone in the gutter, I just feel so bad for it. You feel sorry for the glove? Yeah. It started when I was a kid, with mittens. A glove. A glove. I don't think we're supposed to be upstairs. There was a line at the bathroom on the first floor. I think miss nancy would want people to find a way to relieve themselves. Now this is my style right here. Oh yeah? It's her kid's room. How do you know? 'cause I saw pictures on the fridge. Wow. This one room is bigger than the whole apartment I live in with my grandma and three cousins. That's an eames chair. Fuck. Oh my god, is that a basquiat? That's a basquiat. ( laughs ) some things never change. I used to have these little army men. Oh my god, I can't believe we tried to show her our fucking samples. You made it sound like we were gonna be doing business here, man. That's how lulu made it sound. All right, just put the toy back.  Let's get out of here, come on. No, he's got a million of them. I'm gonna keep it as a souvenir of the illest kids' room I've ever been in. Just put it back, man. Somebody could be watching us. - There could be, like, cameras or something in here. - That's crazy.
