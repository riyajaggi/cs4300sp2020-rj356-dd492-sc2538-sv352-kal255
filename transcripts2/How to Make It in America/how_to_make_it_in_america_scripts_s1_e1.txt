 How to Make It in America (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 1 - Pilot - full transcript 
 When his skateboard-deck business venture hits the wall, twentysomething graphic designer Ben agrees to fund a "sure thing" leather-jacket hustle proposed by good-times best friend Cam. The scheme morphs into downright desperation when Camʼs cousin Rene gets out of jail, looking for repayment of an old loan. Meanwhile, Ben is bummed to discover his ex-girlfriend Rachel is dating Darren, a hot hotelier, and finds little comfort in his horny pursuit of a sexy young thing during her late-night party. With Rene threatening bodily injury if Cam and Ben donʼt repay the loan, David, a schoolmate turned hedge-fund millionaire, saves the day, at least for the moment.
