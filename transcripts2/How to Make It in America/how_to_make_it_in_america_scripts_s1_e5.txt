 How to Make It in America (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - Big in Japan - full transcript 
 Ben finally receives the prototype of his jeans design, but feels a failure because it looks slightly sissy. Ben therefore shies away from asking help form design school buddy Pete Powell, but partner Cam still gets them presented to Japanese buyer Haraki, who orders t-shirts instead. Darren handles more souvenirs of Ben at Rachel's well, while her boss scolds her insensitivity. René hoped to recuperate the $100,000 he hid in a relative's home, but finds him expelled by is bitch-wife's restraining order, and the cash was 'found' by contractor Flaco while converting the apartment into her beauty parlor.

You're just staring at the cheez doodles. - Oh, am I? - You were... In a really intense way. I guess I'm just curious, you know-- what they mean. - What they mean? - Yeah, well, You have to admit it's kind of an odd gift. It's-- it's silly. All right. You know what? If you don't want to tell me, I understand. It's fine. No no. When ben and I first started dating We used to debate everything. We ended up in this debate one night About cheez doodles versus cheetos. I like cheetos. He likes cheez doodles. It's really stupid. We stopped debating after that. I think he was just trying to be funny by giving me those. Yeah, it's funny. I can get rid of them if they make you feel uncomfortable. No. Why waste them, right? They made some bullshit ass calls And on top of that they were talking mad shit. Whatever, man. You talked as much shit as they did. Yeah, but I talk shit because I can back it up... - Usually. - Wow. - What? - That's pete powell. Pete powell? As in genetic denim pete powell? - Ben: Yup. - Cam: Yo, let's go grab him. No. I called him four times, he never called me back. He's obviously not looking to talk. Whatever, man. We've got our samples. We're good. We don't need him. Yo, man, I bet once upon a time he had a sample too. Now you selling his shit at barneys. It's not gonna hurt to ask, right? Yo! Yo, pete! Pete powell! - Cam. Yo, hold up. What's up, man? It's cam. Cam calderon. You know my boy ben, right? Ben epstein? - My old barmy buddy. - How's it going, man? - It's good. - Same old same old? You know I tried calling you, right? - You did? - A few times. - I don't check messages. You should've texted me. What did you want to talk about? We're starting a denim line. - Yeah. Good for you guys. - You got a couple of minutes to talk about it? Yeah, we could use some good pointers. Guys, I'm in town for 24 hours. The only thing I've got time for is Business meetings and seeing my mother. Next time I'm in town, I'll take you to dinner and we'll talk, all right? - Yeah, man. It's all good. - Oh, come on. You can't do a quick l.A. -Style latte with your old buddy? Your partner's a little pushy, ben. - I'm a lot pushy, actually. How can I say no to two guys on the grind? Besides, I could use a cup of coffee. Black. I don't do lattes. - Que pasa, bro? - Rene. Hola. Yeah, how's that rasta monsta moving? I'm trying to push it, rene. Most people around here are looking To get fucked up though, not so energized. Well, do what you can, man. It's appreciated. Have you seen my cousin tito? They tell me he's spending a lot of time here these days. - Yeah, he's in the back. - He's in the back? - Yeah. - Oh, okay. Thanks, joe. little tito puente! Shit, rene. Don't you knock? What if I was naked? What the fuck would you be doing naked in a bar for? - You don't know? - Know what? Gloria-- she kicked me out of the house. - I've been living here. - So how come you didn't call me? I did. You never called me back. Yeah, probably because I thought you needed some money. - Nah, I just needed a place to stay. - Oh! That's worse. See? Everybody's turning their back on me-- even my own family. Come on, I'm just kidding with you. You're my favorite cousin. Now get dressed. We've got to go over to your house. What for? - You remember that little package I gave you to hide in the basement for me? Yeah, of course. I put it in the ceiling like you told me to. That's good. I need it now, all right? So put your stinky-ass feet into those adidas and let's get moving. Rene, I ain't allowed near the house. - Says who? - The court. Gloria got a restraining order against me. What the fuck you do to gloria? - Nothing. She saw some charges from a titty bar on my credit card. She came after me with a blade. I hid in the closet, called 911. Cops came, she started crying And they arrested me. Can you believe that? Yo, bro, I believe it. You both crazy. Come on. I've gotta go. Let's go. So what do you got? Crisp denim. It's catchy. I like it. - '70s inspired. - Two-tone window-pane? No no, and not bells either. All right, I'm curious. Curious enough to get us a sales hookup? Depends. I mean, you got something I can check out? We're actually getting our sample today. - Sorry, guys. - I'm on a 5:00 flight out. - But trust us-- - They're dope. - I'm sure they are. I always thought you'd be the one in the clothing business, not me. You know this guy- he had mad style. Remember that time you rocked those crazy wayfarers To vicky wyler's party? - Yeah, man. - And I clowned you. You did. - Now they're back and hot again. - I stick with the classics. - Mmm. I'll tell you what, I've got a buyer in town from tokyo-- A friend of mine named haraki. He's always asking about up-and-comers. I'm gonna take a chance on you guys. I'll set up a meeting. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thank you, man. He was staring at the cheez doodles. - Staring how? - Like this. Like-- That's quite a stare. Yeah, and then... He ate them. Wow. That is intense. I mean, it's kind of a dickish move if you ask me. Maybe. I-- I understand it. - You do? - Sure. Those cheez doodles are more than just a snack to darren. They're like a message from ben saying, "hey, asshole. I got there first." I don't think that's what ben was trying to do. Well, what were you trying to say by bringing them up to darren's apartment? I wasn't trying to say anything. They just were with all my other gifts. It's a little insensitive. Not only did you bring your ex to your party, But then you kept his gift out on display. Are you not ready to move on? Yes, edie, I'm- I'm ready to move on. Then start showing it. * I don't wanna ill, I just wanna chill * * and keep my hand around a $100 bill * * I don't wanna ill, I just wanna chill... * Yeah, I would definitely live in l.A. - You're lying. - Why would I lie to you? All right, fine. You're lying to yourself then. What? You think I'm gonna die living in the l.E.S.? - Yes, I do. - That's harsh, bro. All right, fine. You might move to brooklyn for a minute though. Wait. Why do you think I'm never gonna leave? Because your grandmother won't, And how are you gonna live without her cooking And cleaning all your clothes, huh? I'll get a girlfriend. Not if they hear you saying shit like that, you won't. Whatever. I'll prove you wrong. I'm gonna be living where there's fun in the sun, son. Yeah, all right. I'll believe it when I see it. You are gonna see it. You're coming with me. I'm not moving anywhere, man. I was born here. I'm gonna die here. And you know why? - You know why. - Don't sing that song. * 'cause, oh, I'm a native new yorker. * Marsha, my lov did you miss me? - And you are? - Cam. From crisp denim. How can you forget about me like that? I'm hurt. - Would you stop harassing her? - Don't worry about me. - I can handle this one. - We're here to pick up our sample. Have a seat.

I'll make you some coffee. - Gracias. - Mm-hmm. Sorry about the wait, fellas. I know you're a busy man. That's why I'm still alive- too busy to die. All my retired friends-- dead. And the rest of 'em got nothing to live for Except snot-nosed grandkids And arguing with health-insurance providers. Not me. Me, I'm a worker. Here we are. - That looks dope. - Yeah. Are you troubled Or are you jumping for joy on the inside? No, it just looked a little different in my head. I think they look good. Try 'em on. - You can go back there. - Yeah? Okay. He's a nice boy, but he carries a lot of tension in his belly. he needs yoga. He needs to get laid. That's what I've been trying to tell him. Ben, come on. Let me see. Good looking pant. Not the right cut for you, though. I think they look good. They're exactly what you wanted. Yes, because I'm a fucking moron. No, you're just a little insane, 'cause you hate everything you ever done. No real guy would wear these. - I would. - Would you really? Jesus. - Only 'cause they're too tight. I like a little loose. You know that, ben. I'm throwing these in the fucking trash. - Whoa, hold on. They're not just yours to throw away. They're mine too. - What about the meeting tonight? - What about it? We can't not show up. Your boy pete put himself out there for us. I'm sure if he saw these, he'd be happy if we didn't show. The jeans are fine, okay? We're going. There's no shot we're going. Then I'm going alone. Unlike you, I'm not gonna blow this chance. Oh, okay. Here you go. Fine. Fine. He's gonna laugh in your face. Just leave me out of it, all right? Cool cool.

Different how? - Well, you know the gardens at the cloisters? Of course. - do you want to have sex there? You want to have sex with me outdoors in the cloisters? I'm game if you're game. Is this about the cheez doodles? - No, I, umm-- - come on, rach. Okay, it does have something to do With the cheez doodles situation. I'm really sorry about that. I-- I just wanted to do something with you That I had never done with anyone else. You know, I appreciate what you're doing. I really do. Actually, I think I owe you an apology. I was an ass this morning when I ate the cheez doodles. It was a dick move. I'm really sorry. So I-- I don't have to have sex with you outdoors In order to make you feel special? - Uh, no. - Oh, good.

Do you know where we can get it? - Hold on. Edie, do you know where I can find x? - Top drawer on the left. - Are you serious? They're left over from burning man. Do they expire? So I think I found a lead. When I was your age, There was no such thing as a divorce. You did not run. You stayed. You fixed the problem. But men were gentlemen back then, rosa. Men were always men. But did they smoke cocaine? Gamble away the wedding gifts? Spend the I.R.S. Tax check On some cheap ho's at the strip bar? This is what tito does? Yeah. - I gotta go to the bathroom, okay? come on.
