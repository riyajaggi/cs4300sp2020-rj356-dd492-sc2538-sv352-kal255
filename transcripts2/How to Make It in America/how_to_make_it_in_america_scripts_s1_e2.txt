 How to Make It in America (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Crisp - full transcript 
 Using $3G they got via yet another high-interest loan from Rene, Ben and Cam buy up a roll of hot premium-denim material, then hit a series of dead ends in their search to find a manufacturer to make samples of their Crisp brand of retro-ʻ70s jeans. Along the way, they parlay a crashed late-night dinner with top fashion designer John Varvatos into a brainstorming meeting that may, or may not, hold the key to their entrepreneurial success. Meanwhile, both Ben and Rachel realize that they havenʼt totally moved on, and vow to try harder in the future.

 Hey, thank Celine for letting me crash here, okay? You're welcome. Do you want to have a snuggle with us, Ben? A little snuggle. Aww. No, I can't, no. But that was fun last night. Then you must come by Freemans later on this evening. We're having a little get-together for my friend Carole. She just booked the J.Crew campaign. Don't you ever take a night off? Never. I might miss something. I'll be there. Yo, dude, I kind of have to say I like seeing you up early, you know, taking care of your denim business shit.

God, in an FIT classroom no less. - You remember. How are you? - I'm good. I'm good. So what do you got? Actually I stopped by to pick your brain about something. - I'm starting a denim line. - Oh, boy. - It's called Crisp... - Mm-hmm. ...And it's inspired by 1970s New York City. So you've got the birth of hip-hop and the birth of punk rock, you know? - Not bell-bottoms? - No no, just the spirit of the '70s. No. Were you even alive in the '70s? - No. - This place was a dump. I mean, Central Park was a war zone. Times Square was full of hookers. Yeah, what's not to love, right? Anyways, I was hoping you could hook me up with a good manufacturer. Wow. You're back 30 seconds, you already want the keys to the kingdom. I'll settle for a recommendation. All the good denim guys I know are in downtown LA. Yeah, that's what I heard, but you don't know anybody still in New York City? Uh, yeah, I'd be happy to make some calls, but I've gotta tell you-- people are a little funky about sharing their sources. - I'll see what I find out. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I appreciate it. Thanks. You know, I always thought you had talent. It's just... your follow-through wasn't there. - Wow. - Mmm. I'm honest with all my students, Ben, even the drop-outs. It's gonna be high-end premium denim. We're gonna call it Crisp. What you think? You say Crisp, I think bacon. Yeah, whatever. What you know about fashion? Just hurry up with my sandwiches. ( Beeps, rings) - ( picks up ) - Yo, how'd it go? - Ben: I don't know, man. - Did you get us a manufacturer? Fresconi told me to go to LA. - You believe that? - No. Fuck that and fuck LA. What does Fresconi know? He's only a teacher. Yeah well, he's a teacher that sold his apparel company for $80 million. - Oh, for real? - Yeah, he knows the business. Well, so do I. Hey, listen. Meet me at 14th Street - at the Jean Shop in 20 minutes. - Why? Because that's where our denim was headed before we got it. They must have somebody local who makes their jeans. - Think about it. - And why would they share that with us? Just let me do what I do. Meet me there in 20 minutes and I've got your egg sandwich. - All right. -( beeps ) Bubba, you want to know the secret to selling jeans? - Cool pockets. - There you go. ( Chuckles ) Yeah. I'll see you later. ( Organ music playing ) - Rene. - Oh. Danny. Father. ( chuckles ) ( whispering ) Hey, it's nice to have you back with us. (Whispering ) Hey, it's nice to be on the outside and not the inside, if you know what I mean. I understand. I led the congregation up in Fishkill. It's no place for a man to live. Yeah, tell me about it. I spent my life going in and out of there just to learn that very lesson. - But you learned the lesson. - Oh, I have. Crime doesn't pay and that's all behind me now. - I'm never going back inside. - I'm happy to hear that. - Yeah. - Good news. You don't have to do it alone. - No? - No. Jesus Christ will help you. Like he helped me find my way, he'll help guide you so you stay with us from now on. Well, I'll tell you-- he's doing a pretty good job. I've got my own legitimate business. In fact, if you're ever looking for a partner for bingo night, my company, Rasta Monsta, would love to sponsor it. Our Lady of Sorrows' Rasta Monsta bingo night- - it has a certain ring to it. - Yeah yeah. No no, I'm serious. I'll set it all up, I'll run the whole thing, provide all the beverages. - Okay? - All right. I'll pitch it to the Fathers. Sounds good. He's gonna be a good boy now, Father Dan. No more prison for him, huh? No. That's my promise to you, Grandma. - Huh. - All right. - All right. - See you. (Funk music playing ) You like this stuff, right? It's fresh. Man: That's our most popular cut. It's made from Japanese selvage denim. - Cool. - Now let me ask you a question: Are these jeans made in America? 'Cause I'm only buying domestic right now. Yeah, all of our jeans are made locally. - Seriously? - Mm-hmm. That's awesome. Isn't that awesome? Yeah, that's definitely awesome. - So you make 'em in New York? - Yeah, in the Bronx. BX! That's where I'm from. Born and raised. What part? Uh, I'm not sure. I can ask the owner. He's in the back. You'd be the man if you could do that. Okay. - Is the kid smooth or what? - ( cell phone ringing) Whatever. ( Inhales sharply ) ( beeps ) Hello. ( Phones ringing ) - Hey. - Ben: Hey, what's up? Um, am I catching you at a had time? - No. No. - Okay, good. Listen, I was wondering if... you wanted to get together later, maybe, to just get a drink or something. - Really? - Yeah, I think we should talk about what happened the other night. What night is that? The under- the-window night, Ben. Right. Yeah. ( Chuckles ) Well, how about- how about that sake spot over on 2nd Avenue? - Okay, sounds good. 8:00? - I'll be there. - All right. Bye. - Bye. ( Phone beeps ) My grandfather was a tailor in a factory on Fordham Road and I was wondering if that's where you guys make these. Fordham Road? Nah. Oh, really. It seems like the kind of work they'd do. What factory do you guys use? Yeah, we found a gem out in Hunts Point-- 38 Minada Avenue. Oh yeah, I know that spot. - Yeah, they're the best. - Yeah yeah yeah. Oh, cool. Anything else I can help you out with? - I think we're good. - Yeah, thanks, man. - Thanks. - Thanks, guys. -( R&B; music playing ) - J' Don't sweat the technique. I The boogie down Bronx-- it just don't got the same flavor like the Lower East Side. Could you keep your voice down and not get us killed up here, please? Yo, relax. I've got peoples in every borough. Yo, as a matter of fact, we ought to hit this Cuban spot after this. - Where we going? - I can't. I've got to get back. - For what? - Rachel asked me to dinner, actually. Pfft. I ain't even gonna say nothing... Good, 'cause I don't want to hear it. ...Except that you're fucking crazy to be trying to go back there. I'm not trying to go back there. If I wanted to, I wouldn't have broken up with her in the first place. She broke up with you. Yeah, the last time, but I broke up with her the first so- Whatever. I'm the one that's always gotta hear it at the end, and it's the same thing- she wasn't happy with you 'cause you were never happy. What? She don't appreciate your misery the way I do. - Right? - All right, this is us-- 38. Yo yo yo yo. Yo, you feeling it? - I'm feeling it. - No, are you feeling it? - I'm feeling it. - All right, come on. ( Saws whirring ) Hey. Hey. Hey! Do you guys make jeans around here? I look like I make jeans, pal? ( Hip-hop music playing ) Yo, why don't you kids make like you in a maze and get lost? Oh shit. I know you. You're Rene Calderon. Oh shit. Rene Calderon. - Do I know you? - My pops grew up with you. He says you OG. Yo, tell your father, whoever he is, that I said that he talks too much. No-- no problem. Let's roll. - Let's roll. - It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Calderon. - We rolling. - Yeah, man. They're just children. No, Grandma. They're little troublemakers who someday are gonna become big troublemakers. - I want to keep you safe. - I'm always safe, Rene. I have many angels up there looking after me. Yeah, but still I figure we'll move you to someplace nice like Yonkers. What would happen to your cousin Cam? He's 30 years old. He should be able to take care of himself. - He's 27. - He's an imbecile. He's not imbecile. He has not had the easy life. I want you to look after him. I'll- I'll try, abuela. I mean, I'll try. -( Kisses ) Okay? - Good boy. ( Hip-hop music playing ) - ♪ Can I kick it? ♪ - ♪ Yes, you can... ♪ - Rachel: Work's really good. - Ben: Yeah? We're working on, like, four different apartments right now, so it gives Edie the excuse to be totally insane. How's, um, Alex? Alex-- he's getting over his breakup with John from Suits. So he's slightly more pleasant to be around. - More pleasant is good. - Just a little bit. - Yeah. - So, umm... - So. - About the other night. Yeah, about that. I want to apologize. - You do? - Yeah. I feel it was really uncool for me to bring Darren to that gallery. He sort of wanted to tag along and I couldn't figure out a way to tell him no, - so I'm sorry. - Yeah. - It's fine. - Good. - Thank you, though, for that. - So you don't hate me? - Never. - Good. So what's up with that guy, anyway? What do you mean, what's up with him? Is he really opening a hotel? Yeah, he's-- yeah. - That's cool. - Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, I mean, on his own? Just-- - Ben. - What? - Don't do that thing. - What thing? That thing that you do when you compare yourself to everybody else in the world and then you get upset that you're not doing better than they are. I'm not doing that thing. I'm just curious on who you're dating, okay? Yeah, but why is it important? It's like we're both moving on, right? Yeah. What? What? You think you're moving on and I'm not? I thought you were moving on, Ben, but then when you show up underneath my window at 4:30 in the morning yelling and screaming-- - I was drunk, Rachel. Come on. - Okay, so the alcohol made you come over there and say things that you just didn't mean? You want to do this? What about you? I mean is it really a sign that you moved on when you care or not whether your ex-boyfriend hates you? Ben, it's not a competition. I-I-I care about you and I-I'm checking up on you, seeing if you're okay. Oh, you're checking up on me? Thanks for that. I'm more than okay, Rachel. I'm great, all right? - Okay. - If I hadn't already moved on-- which I did- all it took was seeing the naked hotel guy in your window and- ( chuckles ) - You know what? - What? I've gotta go. - Really? Ben, this- - I'm sorry. Ben: What's going on, man? (Cam chuckles) Oh ho! - Look who made it in one piece. - Yeah. So, you and Rachel-- are you guys back together? Let's put it this way-- I didn't even get a chance to order. - Hey, are these warm? - Yeah. - Yeah, let me get a slice of this cheese. - Oh, what happened? What always happens. - Thanks, man. - Thanks. - Sorry, bro. - Whatever. It is what it is. Pass that. (Sighs) You know we've got to make our first payment on the denim tomorrow, right? Jesus. Already? It's $300 every Friday. - Fuck. - Well, don't worry. I've got my $150. No, I know. It's just that $1200 a month-- that's 15 grand a year. That's like a Honda with the rims and the navigation system. This whole thing was impulsive. I mean, we have to be the only two idiots in loan-sharking history to pay a vig on a spool of denim. That's what's gonna make our jeans gangsta though. ( laughs ) Yo, are you ready for Celine's little get-together tonight or what? ( Dance music playing ) -( laughing ) - Who is that? Yo. - Hey, what's up, man? - It's good. - How you doing? - I'm doing grand. I was beginning to get worried these ladies were gonna get me wasted and take advantage of me. Yeah, you look petrified. Boys, this is Carole, the guest of honor. Ben and Cam. - Ben: Congratulations. - Thank you. Next up for you, maybe "Vogue" magazine? Well, we shall see. I'm just happy for today. Well, I'm happy for today too. And your hair looks amazing. I'm just putting that out there. We'll talk about it later over a 'Rona. - Yo, Domingo. - What? What's the deal with Carole? Forget it, Cam, all right? She's got a boyfriend and his pops is a Greek shipping magnate. And my pops is a Dominican mechanic, - but that's not gonna stop me. - Yeah, all right. - You're a hater. - You're a fool. Ben, look, your boy needs serious intervention. What's up? What's your deal? Where you at right now? Yeah, you see that guy that Celine's talking to? - Yeah. - Who? Who's that, your shrink? -( Both laugh ) - Yo, your jokes are so terrible. - That's John Varvatos. - The designer? - Ben: Yeah. - Cam: And Celine knows him? Yeah, Celine knows everybody. That's my life. Yo, she has to get us an introduction. Varvatos could definitely hook it up with a manufacturer. What? John, is it all right if I introduce you -to a couple of friends of mine? - Sure. Hey, how are you? - I'm John. - Cam. - Cam, nice to meet you. - Ben Epstein. How you doing? - A pleasure. - We're really big fans. Yeah, I wear your clothes every day. - Thanks so much.

Um, I just wanna say something on behalf of myself, Cam Calderon, my business partner, Ben Epstein, and our new denim line- Crisp Denim. It was an honor to be here tonight and I just want to thank Mr. Varvatos for all his generosity. Thanks, John. And it was good meeting all of you and I look forward to hanging out with you again. We both do. So to John. - Ben: To John. - All: To John. Very sweet. Nice toast. What's this gonna cost me? ( laughs ) We'd love a minute of your time. Why don't you come by my studio tomorrow afternoon? Yeah. Thank you. ( Whispers ) Nice. Very nice, man. ( Reggae music playing ) Rene: Where's my cousin and his little Jewish lover? - Really? - He's got a stupid sense of humor. Oh, there they are with my vig, as they will be every Friday for the rest of their lives. - Not if we outlive you. - Eddie, if I die, I'm gonna will you their debt, okay? - Thank you. - You've got it, man. You boys got something for me? Ben: There you go. - Count it twice. - It's all there. Rene: Who's talking to you? It's all good. I'm impressed. I'm gonna show you guys something. Come on. I know you guys are into that downtown art scene and all so... - Cam: Oh, shit. - Ben: Wow. Yo, don't you touch that with your slimy hands, okay? See this thing here? This thing is gonna make Rasta Monsta famous. - Who did this? - You ever heard of Lee Quiñones? Oh, yeah, he's a graffiti legend. Yeah, to you. To me he's little Lee from the Smith Projects. Yo, Lee did his thing. The truck looks dope. Yeah. You know you're gonna be driving this thing if you're late with my vig. Never gonna happen. We've got a big meeting today. - Who you got a big meeting with? - John Varvatos. Who the fuck is John Varvatos? He is a fashion designer, stupid. Why he meeting with you guys? 'Cause we're starting a denim line and he's gonna help us. You guys making skinny jeans? -( Men laughing ) - Cam: Ha ha ha. Y'all can laugh all y'all want, but y'all gonna see we're gonna change the game. That's what you said about those ugly skate decks. See you next Friday, Rene. ( Phone ringing ) - ( elevator dings) -( people chatting ) How you doing? - Here are Ben and Cam. - Great. Thank you. Hey, fells. How's it going? Mike Heller. - Cam. - Nice to see you. - Ben Epstein. - Hey, how's it going? - Hey. - Look, John sends his apologies. He got called out of town last minute on some urgent Converse business, but he left instructions for me to take the meeting. - I hope that's okay. - Uh, yeah yeah, of course. - Excuse me. - We can always wait till John gets back - and reschedule if that's better for you. - No no no. No, don't worry about it. Just to let you guys know, I'm the head of all denim operations here at John Varvatos. - Oh. So he's the man. Cool. - I try to be. So, fellas, what can I do for you? Well, we're looking for a good denim manufacturer. I know that you guys don't usually like to give out that kind of information, but is there someone that you could recommend for us? Well, we use a manufacturer in Macau. That's a little further than we want to go. - You guys got your samples? - No. That's why we're looking -for a manufacturer- to make them. - Yeah. No, you don't need a manufacturer to make your samples. You need a pattern maker. See, manufacturer takes care of your production line once you guys start getting orders. Well, who makes John's patterns? We do everything in house. - Can you make ours? - ( all laugh ) No. I'm sorry, Cam. We don't do that. - You know he's just kidding, right? - No, I wasn't. - Cam, please. - Do you guys have a business plan? Do you have any financing lined up? Anything? Cam: Not yet, but we're working on it. Can I be straight with you guys? - Yeah, of course. - Yes. Okay, before you guys do anything--- look, just don't. Just don't. Don't do it. - Don't do what? - Don't start a denim line. Do not waste your time. Don't waste your money. A million people before you have failed trying to do exactly what you want to do. Look, guys, I'm really sorry. I don't mean to be a downer. So you think starting a denim line is impossible? All I'm saying is that I had 10 years experience and I had backing and I still couldn't get it done. ( Button clicks) (sighs) ( elevator dings ) ( doors close ) So I guess we need a pattern maker. - Yeah? - Yeah. Fuck that guy. That's why I love you, man. Fuck that dude. - He don't know how we roll. - Yeah.
