 How to Make It in America (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 4 - Unhappy Birthday - full transcript 
 After a hot night in bed with Rachel, Darren must fly back to London and miss the birthday party her boss is throwing for her. So she calls ex Ben, who accepts but hesitates whether to come or honor an earlier promise to take rich friend Kapo -who does surprisingly well with a haughty model- clubbing. Cam accordingly wriggles in and out of a party waitering gig with his mate. Darren's flight is delayed over five hours, so he attends after all.
