And bus-driver ivan who drove that m96 crosstown into the gristede's? Yep, they're super hot right now. They are? Well, I mean, it's more about the guys than their clothes. They have the story behind them - junkies turned fashion designers. People buy into the bad-boy thing. All I see are a bunch of dicks. Don't tell me our jew-minican swagger is wearing off? Not at all. You guys are sweet. Whoa, ben is sweet; I'm scandalous. - Okay, so we were saying- - yes? - How many do you need? - Um... Why don't we start with two? Okay, so two dozen? No, just two for now. Not bad, huh? eddie: You really did it, Just like you told us u would. - All: Yeah. - Jabar: Billboard looks incredible, boss. Man in car: Rasta monsta! Yeah!

My moms can't be our only customer, guys. We gotta do something to get people talking about crisp. Selling six t-shirts a month is not gonna cut it, you know? What if we rock that pop-up shop we talked about? Yes, okay, I like that. Sell some hoodies, get the message out there. Yeah, we'd have to make it crazy ill, though- You know, get people talking about us. One of you needs to get shot. Okay, you can go with the classic- Hookers and blow. You know what? That actually could work. Not the blow, but what if we got some girls To do like a little fetish show like we saw in shinjuku? Oh, yeah yeah yeah. Bring tokyo to the I.E.S. I likehat. Yeah yeah. And then you know what'll make it crazy sick? Is if jay-z was there. No no no no no no. My boy rich from temple israel Is practically running roc nation right now. - What? - I'm gonna go ahead and give him a call. Sure, you get us jigga and you get us geishas And I'll reach out to obama, see if the homie can make it. Listen, the best luther song Was * a thousand kisses from you... * you're killing me right now. As a matter of fact, you're killing luther right now with that. What the- Just wanted to return this to you. You couldn't pay me enough to wear it ever again. Debbie. Debbie, wait. Mama, mama, where you going, baby? Where you going in such a hurry? - Away from you. - Why you so angry? That piece-of-shit wall on stanton? - You look good up there, baby. - Oh, do I? - Yeah. - Can you even tell it's me? You can barely see my face. And that is not my booty. Look, jabar, he photoshopped it. You know, they do that for all the billboards. Even eva mendes gets the photoshop. You told me that I was gonna be the face of rasta monsta. And for some dumb reason, I decided to believe you. Look look, I took a poll of all the pictures And we all agreed that's the best one. Be proud. Enjoy your pervert billboard, 'cause you're not getting near my booty ever again. Debbie. Debbie! So you think this girl will do our fetish show? Trust me. * and you believe me, yeah, bitch, believe me * * hey yo, it's me and spank rock * * we always poppin' it hot * * he gets the ladies in line, I got you ridin' my jock * - * I keep it dirty, not like fergie... * - wow. * ain't the black eyed peas, this shit ain't happy * * I'm a trashy boastful bitch mc * * my rhymes are painfully fresh * * my pussy's tastin' the best... * Absolutely not. That's disgusting. Ben, I thought you were fucking around about the eel. Okay okay, forget the eels. Look, we just want something edgy and shocking Like this - like this authentic fetish show we saw in shinjuku. okay. That's kind of fun. Maybe we can do something "about fetish," But still completely post-feminist. Yes, about fetish, If you still, you know, wear the outfits and, like, Torture each other. Gently- gently torture. You want me to gently torture jin-suk? Miss tomako, Bear with us here. Would it clear your feminist conscience If we donated some of that cali kush you love so much? I know it's your fave. Yo, did you get my email about taking the day off on Friday? No. It must have got caught in my not-a-shot-in-hell mail folder. - Oh well. - Rene, come on. I'm having a pop-up shop. - You're having a pop-tart what? - Pop-up shop. Me and ben are going to take over this empty storefront For a few hours to sell our new hoodies And to show people what crisp is about. I need the day to set it up. You need a day to settle your accounts payable With my korean grocers out in flushing. Let your boyfriend ben handle it. It's too much for ben to do it alone. It's gonna be a big fashion event. A fashion event? On orchard street? Okay, maybe I could let you take the day off If you push rasta monsta at your party. I'm talking signs, cut-outs, bottle displays. You're really gonna make me do that? You want the day off? Hell yeah. And I want to show up to check it out personally. So put me on your little guest list for me plus four, okay, papi? Cafe, mama. Dude, this is definitely doing something weird to my boobs. - Yeah, it's making them look large and perfect. - Oh. Um, you know I haven't, like, called anyone, So nobody knows that I'm- I'm back. It's better that way- incognito. I don't know, lulu. You know what sucks about traveling? - No. - Coming home. I mean, I feel like when I was out there, I- I had my shit figured out, you know? And now that I'm back, it's just, like, "can I get a job?" you know, "should I hit this party?" "can I afford direct tv?" You know, it's like, oh, I never fuckin' left. Well, I think your boobs got bigger. No, it's this dress. It's too "titular. " Try the phillip lim. It's super cute. I can't believe ben has a line now. - Your boy's talented. - Does he- Does he know that I'm- I'm coming to the- No idea. You didn't r. S.V.P. Plus one? It's a pop-up shop on orchard. I'm pretty sure it's open to the public. - Yeah, but I'm not exactly the public. - Oh please. Yeah, what's up, everybody? 40 deuce radio, evr. Com. - We got d. J. Scarlizzy from cali- - scarleezy! - Straight up. - D.J. Scarleezy, I'm sorry. You have that gangster look about you. You have to keep that going. - Yeah. - And I'm gonna ask you, What- what record inspired you to become a d. J.? Well, I guess the record that really made me want to become a d. J. Was "straight outta compton. " Maybe it's 'cause I'm from cali too. How you likin' the stets of new york? - Love it, love it. - Can you roll a blunt? - One-handed, bitch, one-handed. - All right. You gonna hang out with us right after the show. This is 40 deuce radio. You're listening to evr. Com.

They're gonna be at the pop-up shop tomorrow night Doing this crazy fetish show like you've never seen in america. You gotta come down and check it out. So how does that work, fellas? I go to your store - I could buy a hooded sweatshirt in the front - And pee on a schoolgirl in the back? Ha! Yeah, no, I mean I can't exactly say on air, But whatever happens in the back stays in the back. All right, fellas, anything else we need to know about tomorrow night? Yeah, jay-z will be in the building. He might- uh, he might be in the building 'cause we're reaching out to him. Why are you melting down right now? - I'm not melting down. I'm starting a buzz. - That's what that was? Look, if we don't sell some hoodies tomorrow, we're fucked, okay? - Literally dead broke. - We're gonna be fine tomorrow. But we can't be on the radio acting desperate like that. Yo, who's acting? The account is empty and the bills are due. Nobody in new york knows who the fuck we are. They're gonna find out. We've got this. Yeah, well, we're holding on by a thread. Don't hold on so tight. Was that too hard? - What? - Was that too hard? - No. - Oh. Whoa! Okay. Julie: I didn't realize you were such a spanker. Do you think, like, I'm too nice to make it as a designer? Wow. Were you just practicing being edgy on my ass? Sorry. Don't be. I actually kind of liked it. I like that you're nice. What do you want? I was in the area. I wanted to give you these. thanks. Why are you so upset?

Look, we're gonna have an in-store display next month. I told myself, if he chooses a pretty photo, he's a good guy. If he uses a booty photo, He's just like the rest of the losers I've dated. I am a good guy, debbie. That's why I'm here- - To apologize and make it up to you. - How you gonna do that?
