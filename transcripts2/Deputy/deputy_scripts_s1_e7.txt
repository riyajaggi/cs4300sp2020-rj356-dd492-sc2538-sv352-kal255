 Previously on "Deputy..." Asking me to look into an LAPD case on your old buddy is no small ask. I need you to understand the political repercussions prior to inserting yourself into another agency's investigation. I finally heard from the County, and we're approved. We're officially qualified to be foster parents. Are you serious? You might be pregnant? I'm here to talk about something that happened earlier today with the LAPD and one of my deputies.

 I'm a sheriff's deputy. - My name is Joseph Harris. - Down on the ground! Turn around, Detective. Are you sure this is how you want it? - Hey, honey. - There's a shooter. - Where's the gunman? - You! Get off the phone. - Now! - Paula! There's not a manual for how to save hostages when one's your wife, is there? Why is this happening? Is it because you're sheriff? I know that because I'm sheriff I'm in a position to stop them. I just want Mom to be okay.

 Me too, baby. Me too. How long you been up? Is this our life now? Which part? This. You okay? Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out if I'm gonna have to drive through a wall of reporters every time I go to work until you retire. No. What happened at the jail will be old news by tomorrow. It's not just that. First Luna. Then the cop you arrested. And now this. It's you. You're the news. You sure you're okay? Yes. I have too much work not to be. With the Santa Clarita fire only at five percent containment, the Los Angeles Fire Department has enlisted the help of the Sheriff's Department to evacuate residents... Are you going up there? If it comes to it, yeah. Officials are worried about the winds picking up... What are they waiting for? Ugh. Ignore them. Just, let's have breakfast. I can't eat. I think I'm getting the flu or something. Hmm. Do you wanna stay home? Yeah, I think so. Are they gonna be here every day? Not every. Just for now. So, Mom gets held hostage and they trap us in the house? Why can't you just go back to being a deputy? You are the boss, right? Ah, Bishop's here. They'll follow me, so you can make your clean getaway. You're getting pretty good at it. It'll get better, I promise. I know you want that to be true. So do I. - I'll see you tonight. - Love you. Guys, come on, let's go. Sheriff Hollister, how is your wife coping? None of your business. What's your plan on dealing with the subpoena? Do you think going up against the LAPD is gonna hurt your chances for reelection? Every day crimes are committed. Every day people struggle. I'm running a department filled with deputies who wanna make that struggle go away. Every day. Today's no different. So you wanna talk about that, you know where to find me. You wanna talk about my wife, go stand on somebody else's lawn. Thank you. You have any comments on the Santa Clarita fire? There's more to come on that. Hi. I'm headed out. I gotta go up to Santa Clarita. Organizing the evac with all these fires. Okay. - So... - So... What do you say... we tell them tonight? I don't know. And it's not too soon? - For us or for them? - Both. Wish things were a little bit more... settled. You know, it's so early. Just don't wanna... get our hopes up again. Maybe we should wait until we know this is really real. Hey, hey, hey. This is real. This baby's the one. I know it. I can feel it. A baby means you're gonna get rid of us, doesn't it? Department of Psychological Services is offering to sit down with you. Not a chance. LAPD's Criminal Investigation Division called again. LAPD's taken up enough of my time lately. What else? Media training with the department's public relations for interviews... Hard pass. You've put this off three times, boss. This LAPD thing is not going anywhere. Just catch and release. Or they'll keep coming after you. Well, I'm not going anywhere. Do the training. - Next. - Oy. Okay. Well, you're not gonna like this one either, but I hear London is planning a huge fundraiser for his campaign. Really? Good for him. You're okay with that? Ah, it's a free world. If he wants... Not seeing a lot of fat to trim around here. Can we just focus on the task at hand, please? Put your arms up. I mean, how could somebody expect you to make budget cuts when... Aren't you supposed to make that hurt less? You bruised three ribs. Hurting less isn't gonna be in your vocabulary for a while. How long is this gonna take? If you stop moving, ten minutes. If not... forever. I'm sorry. It's just we have a very full day. Yeah, not anymore you don't. Wait, what are you talking about? I'm talking about a concussion, 10-stitch laceration and you mentioned back pain, correct? No, I'm-I'm fine. Well, we'll be the judge of that. After a CAT scan and a period of observation. Now hold still. Sheriff, you got that budget meeting up first, - and then... - I'm on it. Well, you say that now but a day like this could easily be derailed. Bishop, just concentrate on getting better. Me and the day, we'll take care of ourselves. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doin'? You all right? Yeah, I'll push through. How are the fires lookin'? It's bad. It's comin' off strong. I was on my way out there to help when I heard. How's Bishop? She got a concussion. She'll be fine. What about you? You good? Me? I'm good. You sure about that? Well, Teresa and I are gonna have a baby. She's pregnant. Whew. Congratulations, brother. Father of three. That's a pretty big deal. Fingers crossed, man. It's still early on yet. Now Roberto thinks us having a baby means we're not gonna want him and Camilla around anymore. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. Right? Everything's gonna work out the way it's supposed to. All right, I'll handle these clowns. All right. Hollister. Sheriff, it's Deputy Tabnick. Up in Angeles National Forest. - Hey. - Can you hear me all right? I can. You working fire evac, Tabnick? No, I'm southeast of the fires. I got something else. Lay it out. Found a car up here. Came off Crest Highway. Driver's gone. Passenger too. There's blood on the scene, so somebody got hurt. The VIN's removed so I ran the plates. Looks like the car's cold-plated. Now most of our guys are working the evacuations. So I wouldn't have called you directly but I just remembered what they used to say about you. Oh, yeah? What's that? Bill Hollister knows this forest better than the trees. Is that what they say? Yeah. And, look, I'm smart enough to know what I don't know, and I don't know these woods. Not like you. Well, I wish I could take a run up there. I know, I know, I get it. Resources are stretched thin with the fire and you being in charge. I just thought it was worth a call. Well, I'll tell you what I can do. I got somebody I can put on it. He can find the who of it. And then I can send him your way. That sound good? Yeah, it does. Thanks, Sheriff. I'm gonna pass you over to Deputy Ward. Copy that. You're goin' up. This is Cade. Hey, guys, come on in. Guys, there were like a dozen reporters right outside my house. Yeah, you're like a celebrity. Oh, shut up. Feels extra naughty ditching school with the sheriff's daughter. The sheriff's famous daughter. As if. No, totally. Own it, girl. You sure your folks are gone like all day? They both work all the time. We're good. We can play music, watch movies, eat whatever. Your parents have a liquor cabinet? All right, canvass all gas stations in La Cañada, La Crescenta, and Glendale. Approximate two-hour window from the crash. We're looking for a 1999 Pontiac Bonneville. - Can you pull that up, please? - Yes, sir. Boom, looks like this. Any questions? No? Good. This may take a while. At my cousin's bat mitzvah, they had an open bar. We scammed a bottle of Chablis. My cousin hooked up with one of the waiters. Killer DJ, though. Yeah, that's-that's what I'm thinking I should get. My parents want it to be all traditional with a mariachi band. I'm like, no way, this is my day. Are we really gonna drink that? It's the only thing my parents won't miss. Looks nasty. What the hell? What are you doing? I'm a member of the press. See? So what? This is private property. Well, I'm well within my rights to record you. Sorry, stalking isn't legal. You're the daughter of a public figure, so... Damn, you got paparazzi, Mags. At least he's cute. All right, I am not paparazzi. I'm a political correspondent and I'm doing... I don't care what you're doing. Now I'm asking nicely. Please leave. Or I'm calling my father. Go ahead. You're supposed to be at school, aren't you? I said stop, okay! Hey. What... Sir. Right here. You gotta be kidding me. All right, stop. Zoom in. That's it. All right, make sure everybody gets this. Missing Persons, Family Services, Juvie. I want BOLO out to every station in LA. Now, if we don't get a hit by the end of day, we'll take it statewide. Yes, sir. Who are you? This is hell of a situation. I might need a larger response. Well, whatever you need. Airships. More deputies. More boots on the ground, the better. Well, yeah, as long as the wind doesn't pick up. Exactly. We're drawing up a plan now. Keep me posted. Will do. Thanks, Sheriff. What do you got? White male, mid 40s. Bad start. Yeah, him and a girl. Teenager. There's no VIN, no sign of 'em at the car. It's somethin'. Yeah. I'm on my way up there right now. I got an airship coming out of Riverside looking at most likely paths of travel from the car, then starting a grid search. All right, I'll update you from the scene. Damn it. Hey. Cade. Tabnick. Thanks for coming up. Yeah. I saw those fires driving up. Yeah, it's hard to believe we are still 20 miles away. Imagine if it was just over this ridge. Well, check this out. So, it could be that they brought a dead pet up here to bury. Quicklime so the coyotes won't dig it up. I had a cat that passed away and I buried it in my backyard. But I don't see a dead cat. So it's probably not about that. You think? Media training is important, Sheriff. If the press asks how you're going to respond to crime on the Metro, what do you say? Oh, we've implemented a strict eye for an eye policy. This would all be less painful if you just played along. I doubt that, but... I'll give it a try. I'm all yours. Excuse me. Yeah. How we doin'? A deputy in Chatsworth recognized her from a BOLO a ways back. Her name is Tulsa Vaughn. Missing for two years... 13 then, 15 now. And there's a bag of quicklime in the trunk of the Bonneville along with a shovel. - Find her. - You got it. Shall I continue? Yes, please. Sorry. Let's see how you do with something more substantial. Sources close to the LAPD have described the Sheriff's Department as, quote, "Reckless cowboys." Now, Sheriff, the key to answering questions is to answer with a question. - Hello? - Oh, I'm here. Reckless? Never. Cowboys? Hopefully, someday. Good job. Now, the story the LAPD will tell is that you bullied your way into an investigation in a very public way for your own benefit. I wouldn't call the last few weeks, let alone the last few hours, a benefit. No offense. None taken. We all have a job to do. You're right. And mine isn't in here. Not today. Why is that? Let me answer that question with a question. Which is gonna make me lose more sleep, wondering why I didn't help find the missing girl or why I left a meeting early? Well, we both know the answer to that question. We'll pick this up another time, Dawn. Right now, someone needs me up in those mountains. Where's Genevieve? I sent her home. I'm fine. Plus, she was hovering. Aw. Sometimes hovering can be nice. Can it though? Well, your blood levels, kidney, liver, HDL... It's fine. There's a tick up in your thyroid. - And a spike in your hormone... - I said it's fine. Yeah. Yeah, it's all good. Great. So I can go? You are sounding more and more like Bill every day. No, you need to get a CT scan, so we can make sure that you don't have anything more than a concussion. Isn't that Maggie? Sheriff. Anything from the airship? Nothing other than they're out there looking. Just started going over the grid. I heard the winds picked up though. It's pushing the fire south straight towards us. I can smell it. We got no receipts, no registration and no VIN. What about the engine number? Not yet. What are you doing, Sheriff? Old cars like this, they usually have the serial number on the bottom of the engine. Bingo. You run that through the DMV, you got your car owner. Cell phone service? Poor to none up here but I can patch you through to whoever on the sat phone. All right. What else we got? Well, we got this blood trail and then it just stops. Soft soil. It's a track trap. I'd say Tulsa went this way, so did the driver. - What do you think? - I think it's a good call. Seven-letter word for noisy serpent. Hmm. Rattler. Minnick. Sheriff on line three. Sheriff. What are you workin' on? Uh, filing reports. I need to put you and Joseph on something. You got us. I got an engine number from a car. I need you to run it. Get a name and an address, check it out. Okay. What are we looking at? An abducted girl. It's probably the kidnapper's car. - Ready? - Go for it. You keep us posted about the fire, all right? I don't wanna get boxed in. Will do, Sheriff. Come on. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you okay? Help me. Please! Please can you help me? Yeah, of course we can. - He's gonna... - Sweetie! I've been lookin' all over for you. What's going on here? Ah, you know... Teenagers. Stolen license plate, no VIN, but our boy didn't realize there's serial numbers on old engines, so... Roger Durbin. Works LAWP. Meter reader. No criminal record. Looks abandoned. Yeah, well, looks ain't everything. Help! Please, help! Sheriff's Department! Thank the Lord. I thought no one would ever find us. Whoa. You got a sucking chest wound. He's got a punctured lung. He needs a chest seal. I gotta see if there's an exit. There's no exit. I got you. Hang in there, all right? Hang in there. - Here you go. - Hang in there. Hang in there. - You got it? - Yep, yep, yep. All right, watch it. Lay down, brother, lay down. All right, you got this? Yeah. You're going after him? I'm goin' straight at him. They went that way. Leads right up over a ridge. What they don't know is there's a shortcut this way. Dry creek bed. - Goes around. - Right. Get there before them. Hit 'em head on. I'm gonna radio medevac. You sure you don't wanna wait for me? By the time we get him out, come back, fire could be all over the place. Besides, if Tulsa's alive, which I think she is, she can't wait. So neither can I. Come on. Tulsa. Sweetie. Please don't be mad. Mad? Why would I be mad? Mad about you grabbing the steering wheel, making me crash my car, or making me fall and hurting my leg. I'm not even mad... for you making me run all this way. I just wanna know what happened. I twisted my ankle. I bet you can still walk on it. You don't have to do what you're gonna do. Okay? I will be good. I will be better than good. Promise. I know you will. But it's not about that. You just got... too old. I'm not carrying you all the way up to the clearing. But you're gonna like it there. It's very pretty. Peaceful. Sound good? Sounds good. Come on. Help me up? Stop! Go! Let's go. What's going on here, Maggie? I was harassed. That's what's going on. Yeah. I understand that. But the reason you were harassed is you lied about being sick. I stood up for myself and did exactly what you and Dad taught me to do and all you care about is missing one day of school? Do I care that some creep was basically stalking my daughter? Of course I do. But do I care about the fact that you put yourself in a position that made it easy for him to do so? Yes, I do. You wouldn't even know I skipped school if it wasn't for Dad's new job, so... We need to learn to be strategic. We didn't sign up for this but we are under the microscope. But it is what it is, and we can't change it or what other people do. We can only control what we do. And what we do... what we've always done... Try as hard as we can to do the right thing. I know. But I didn't ask for all this stuff. Reporters and being watched. I know. I know. But life isn't always about what you ask for. It's about what you're given. And what you do with what you're given. Aye. Nice try. I'm grounded, I know, but do we have to tell Dad? I think you know the answer to that one. Bishop. Hi. I thought you went home. I did. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, fine. I wanna talk about what happened today. You were reading my chart, I got angry and... I wanted to tell you why. I almost did earlier but then... I don't know, I thought you were gonna judge me or something. I think judgment is something people turn to when they're scared. Or they don't understand. I don't scare easy, and I would like more than anything to understand what you're going through. Come in. Okay, I'm... I'm really sorry for getting upset. You did not deserve that. You don't have to apologize to me. You were just held hostage. I feel selfish talking about my problems. Look, I got into medicine to help people. So trust me when I tell you, that helping you... helps me, too. It-it's... difficult for me to talk about certain things. Biological things. Of course. Doctor-patient confidentiality. Till recently, I didn't have a word for... what I felt like on the inside. I let people assume. I didn't wanna make anyone else feel uncomfortable, but that just made me feel worse. You know, I hate labels. And here I am trying to give myself one. Hmm. Well, look, obviously, I understand biology. There are more than two sexes. I don't understand all the layers of identity, but I do know, fundamentally, that not living one's truth is detrimental to your psyche. And I don't wanna do that to myself anymore. This accident made it very clear that tomorrow is not a guarantee, and I need to be me. I'm getting closer every day to exactly what that is. But for now, I know... I'm not all woman. Thank you... for trusting me with that. It must've been very difficult to live with that for so long. Thank you. I-I had no idea how badly I needed to say that to someone. I wish I knew it was gonna be this easy with Genevieve. Well, you don't have to tell her until you're ready. I am, but what if she rejects me? Bishop... you are remarkable. I mean it. If Genevieve rejects you, she didn't deserve you in the first place. If you don't wanna talk to us, can you maybe give us your name? We can't get you home - if we don't have any information. - Here. Let me. Hi. We want you to know that you're safe here. You don't have to be... His name's St. Michael. Maria. What's that? That's my name. Maria. Roger kidnapped you. I'm no kid, but, yeah, he took me. - From where? - Bus station. He said he'd give me a ride 'cause I was trying to get to Ventura 'cause I got people up there. Why you grillin' me? Just trying to get things straight. What's not straight? I was a prisoner. Is that what Maria would say, that you were a prisoner? She talked to you? Yes. Oh. Well, that's good, then, right? It is. You know, Maria... her wrists. They're all cut and bruised from the handcuffs. Yeah. Yours aren't. And according to the County Clerk's office, Roger and Janet Wilcox were married in Van Nuys in 2005. That's you, isn't it? That's your maiden name? Wilcox, right? I didn't want this. Not gettin' 'em, not gettin' rid of 'em. What do you mean, "Getting rid of them"? Janet! He told me I was old. Used up. Started bringing home girls. And he treated 'em good. Everything but letting 'em go. But then once they got older... Roger did not like 'em old. That's when he would take 'em up and... and go get another one. That's what happened to Tulsa? She got too old? Old and smart. Too smart for her own good. Where is up, Janet? Up in the woods. Up, up, up. What about Janet? She's old. That's different and you know it. But... But... What if I was your new Janet? Okay? Like-like Maria's your new me? Okay? I can be your new Janet. And I'll be so good. I'll be better than Janet. I'll be so much better. Please. I'm not gonna do that. Janet's Janet, Maria's Maria, and you are you. Why don't you just shoot me here? That's not how it's supposed to be. You need to be with those other girls. That's what I need to happen and that's what we're going to do. Need something, Janet. Something about where Roger was taking Tulsa. Think. It's up in the woods. That's all he told me. Oh, please. All these years, all the other girls. You've been up there, haven't you? No. He likes to be alone with them when he says goodbye. Come on! Where is it? When he came home, I know he said something! He-he loved the view. He said he liked the view of the place with the peaks. Like horns. The horns of a demon. Two peaks like horns. Copy that? I know where he's going. Come on! Come on. Sorry, Tulsa. This has to be done. - No. - Goodbye. No, no, no. Please! Please, you don't have to do this. Are you all right? All right. I need you to be brave just a little bit longer, okay? You're gonna go find Roger. I am. Okay. Okay. I'll be brave. You never have to be scared of him again. I promise you that. I want you to stay put. Stay right here. 'Cause I'm coming back for ya. - Okay. - All right. Tulsa, I'll be back. Come on. Come on. I love these girls. All of 'em. Tulsa maybe the most. But then they grew up, I didn't know what to do with them. So I brought 'em here. And this is where they'll stay. I still got six rounds left. But I ain't gonna waste 'em on you. I don't know what the hell you are. We're gonna end this like men. And I'm gonna enjoy kicking your ass. Ah, let me just look at this view one more time. I love it. Not a chance. As I write this, I know full well that my words are useless. They can't bring your daughter back. They can't make sense of why. There is no why. It took me a long time to figure that out. It's my job to bring closure, so here it is... The man responsible for these crimes is gone. The girl has been saved. And we would all like to thank the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and everyone who has helped and is helping. We're so glad to know that Tulsa is safe and sound and back with her father now. For the rest of our little girls, who are in God's hands now... we're so thankful that we get to say goodbye knowing that our babies are resting peacefully. And we hold fast to the mission doing everything within our power To make sure it never happens again. ...that was the fire chief just moments ago announcing the Santa Clarita fire has been contained, and sheriff deputies are coordinating efforts to return displaced residents to their... Are they still awake? No. But I talked to them. I told 'em they're a part of our family, and family is forever. So... I think we're okay. Good. Your job, being my daughter, has to do with putting up with me and my job. And doin' the right thing. Telling the truth. Goin' to school every day. But you know that already. We've grounded you, and you're way too smart to make the same mistake twice. So let me just say what I really wanna say. A guy was bothering you. You made him stop. That sum it up? On the end of the day, that's what counts. I did what needed to be done, I came home safe. So did you. And I'm sorry that my job is hard on you, on the both of you. I didn't ask for it and neither did you. But I can't do it without you. So I was wondering if maybe we could start thinking about whether my new job is something we might be able to get used to. And one more thing, Mags. What's that? I'm proud of you.
