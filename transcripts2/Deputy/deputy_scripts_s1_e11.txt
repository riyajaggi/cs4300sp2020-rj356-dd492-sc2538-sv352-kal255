 Previously on Deputy... You have gotten so big! It's been too long since I've seen these two. Grandma said we're gonna see her all the time now. Is that okay? I wondered how a national security analyst might end up driving the sheriff of LA County, so I called your supervisor. I know what went down. Sorry, doc. We had to take matters into our own hands.

 If anything goes wrong, I will kill you. District Attorney Riley, I've handed you the guaranteed conviction of a corrupt cop. How are you not running with this? Today I announce my candidacy for sheriff of Los Angeles County. Looks like things have been going well with the children. Roberto's grades are up. That's excellent. Yeah, we've made a lot of progress the last few months. -Feels like... -Feels like a family.

 Straight up. I am obligated to inform you that Roberto and Camilla's maternal grandmother has filed for custody of the grandchildren. My God. I knew it. She called in this past... So she just shows up. Barely knows the kids. -Cade. -No, no, no. We've been caring for these kids like they're our own for months. They are our own. This is why we go over concurrent planning. Something like this is always a possibility. That woman didn't even go to their father's funeral, Okay? She's just gonna swoop in and take them from us? What's the angle here? She doin' it for the money? Carmen is doing all the required work. She's making the efforts. Effort? Did you even do a background check? 'Cause if she's hanging outwith the same scumbags he was... Okay, listen, obviously, you can recognize that our-our main concern is for the well-being of Camilla and Roberto. We've provided a safe, stable home for them. The first they've ever had. We can't let this happen. I'm not gonna. Nothing has been decided yet. But biological relatives are preferred. You told us that. All I can say is trust the process. I know the process. I have my own. What are our options? Honestly? You're a lawyer. Present the best case you can. I'm supposed to be the one with a thousand-yard stare, young man. What's that? Stop thinking so hard. It doesn't suit you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. What the hell is that? It's a Monte Cristo sandwich. What do you mean, what the hell is that? At least I eat. What's your excuse? I'm not hungry. If you ask me, it's your conscience. Maybe. This race... You got a 10th floor suck up, acting like he knows best. Old Jerry. And let's not forget the ambulance chaser. She probably wants to sue our own people. And there you are, not eatin'. Why don't you just say it? Say it. I want the job, all right? I want it. You're damn right you do. So what's the problem? Paula. Maggie. Even Joseph could get hurt if I... Let me tell you something, son. You're gonna piss folks offno matter what. That's just life. Might as well be for somethin' worth a damn. They see the good that you do. Trust me. Thank you. Late night? What makes you say that? You looked a little roughthis morning. You and your boys turn up for Matthew's birthday? -How was it? -I didn't go. Then what... Let me guess. Carter and coalition. They get a bad wrap but they're good dudes. Trust me, Carter and his boys are not the crew you wanna roll with. Can't believe you faked on your boys like that. Look, things are different now. I-I tried to fit in with them, I just... Can we drop it, please? -He just ran that stop sign. -Light him up. -Watch now. -I see him. He put something in the back seat. Good. You take the lead on this one. Evals are coming up. You can't be a trainee forever. Eyes up. Can I help you with something, officer? You blew through a stop sign back there. Can I see your license and registration, please? This your company? It's not mine. I just work for them. Good benefits though. You know what I mean? Deputy Minnick, I need youover here, please. I'll run it. Why'd you put that bag in the back seat? What do you mean? When I pulled you over, you put that bag in the back seat. Why? I thought it would be safer. How's that? Didn't want you to think there was something in the front seat to worry about, you know? What would I be worried about? Something bad. -Nothing? -Record's clean. Get out of the car for me. What's wrong? We were being friendly. Out. Now. It's no problem, all right? Okay, hey, guys. Just-just tell me what I did wrong. Your ID is fake. So, driving with no license, for starters. No way. I just got that, okay? I waited in line and everything. You're under arrest. It's not mine. Suppose this isn't either. Well, maybe it belongs to you. Put his ass in the back of the car. -I'll call it in. -All right. Sheriff, do you know what this election is about? I've got a strong suspicion that you'd like to tell me. It's about space. And time. You been practicing this? There's no more space for men like you. No untamed land. Not in this city. Not even in this county. And certainly not in this election. I guess you've never been to Lancaster. The world has moved on. People don't want a gunslinger in this office. They want an advocate. A winner. And you know what? They deserve one. It is my time. Well, then, stop wasting it, and have your monkeys come up with a better sales pitch. I'm opening an investigation into your office's handling of the Johnson case. Get out. I got a court order. And I'm gonna be deposing key witnesses. I won't say it twice. It was your choice to call the Times, Bill. Live with it. What is all this? The nurses wanted to thank you for saving our jobs. It means a lot. So we wanted to show you, you mean a lot. To us. Thank you, everyone. I'm sorry it got down to the wire. I'm sure I wasn't the only one losing sleep over the financial dilemma facing the hospital. But knowing I was gonna see your beautiful faces made it a lot easier to get up this morning. All right, let's show the administration how valuable we are so that we never have to do this again. Pop the gate. Give me your fingers. Okay, no way it's a new entry that just hasn't hit the system yet? Okay, thank you. This is a damn good fake. Mag strip works and everything. I'm impressed. Professional grade forgery. Ten grand in cash. Yeah, the exact amount you can bring into the country. Can we get him on bribery? He didn't explicitly offer us the money. I just get a bad vibe off this guy. When you're pulled over, you're supposed to be intimidated, especially if you have a fake ID and a bag full of cash. It's like he's cool with being behind bars. I bet he's had practice. Won't really know anything for sure until the prints come back. -Hey, Sheriff. -Good morning, Sheriff. -Sheriff. -Unofficial visit. Everybody go back to what you were doing. -Sir. -Hey. You down here for a case? Yeah. Man, I missed it down here. Bad coffee. 1950's office furniture. And real paperwork. You okay, sir? Not really. -You got a sec? -Yeah. They're gonna give Johnson a deal. What? Why? Short answer, it's political. We can fight it, Bill. We have to. Fight's comin' to us. DA flipped the table. She's investigating how we intervened in the case. Me and you in particular. She's got a court order behind her. Good. She can bring it. Well, you're gonna have to sit with her. We can get you a union rep, department lawyer. -Whatever you want. -I don't want anyone. I know my truth. All right. Well, just remember it's not personal. I know it feels like that. But emotion's your enemy here. Gives her leverage. It's just about power, nothing else. Yeah, I'm ready. Don't be too ready. -What's up? -Multiple 245s. Sounds like drive-bys. David-5-5-7 responding. -How many shootings? -Three, so far. -Minnick, you rollin' out? -Yes, sir. What about me? Handle that paperwork, boot. You heard her. Deputy Bishop. Please have a seat. It's nice to meet you, too. Detective Bishop, I understand that you, personally, voiced concern about Sheriff Hollister getting himself involved in the LAPD murder case led by Detective Johnson. Should I have an attorney present? Or my union rep maybe? Well, I mean, you are here out of your own recognizance, as I see it. I mean, if you want an attorney present, that's your prerogative. Although I have a feeling that you can handle yourself just fine. Did you voice concern? It's been so busy. I moved to Majors. I broke up with my girlfriend. I just... I just don't remember anything like what you're describing. You know what? You and I, we should clear the air. I don't want there to be any misunderstandings straight out of the gate. This deposition order, it has nothing to do with you personally. Good to know. I'm an outsider here. You know it, I know it. It's, why I had to do my own research. To play catch-up. What is that? Evidence. Of what? Department violations. The Johnson case is merely emblematic of larger, system-wide failures. Now, okay, a lot of this predates Sheriff Hollister, but he is not the man to implement reforms. The whole John Wayne routine only goes so far. The results since Sheriff Hollister took office -speak for themselves. -At what cost? The future of this department isn't in the past. It is right now. With people like you, not him. Look, this is not a hard case to make. It is right here in black and white. You know what I haven't gotten into... are the secrets. You know, the tucked away stuff. But I will. It was nice talking to you. And I'm sorry about your girlfriend. So you've been involved in how many shootings since Sheriff Hollister took office? It's not polite to count. More than ten? Less than 20? We all go through the same review after a shooting. You know that, Carol. You're fishin'. Come on, Cade, I'm the county's district attorney, I don't fish. Then why haven't you asked me about the Johnson case 'cause that's what this whole song and dance is, right? I gotta get this. Wait, wait, wait. You can't just walk out. Hey, I'll tell Bill you said hi. And I'll put together a grand jury before you can blink! So you don't have a real name. Guy's using a fake. Will take a while to get his prints back. Send me a picture of the ID. I will see if I can get my contacts at State to run the face. Also, there's a company name on his car rental. Camino Verdad. I haven't been able to find anything. Send it over, too. -Okay. -Are you gonna record this? Should I? It's your investigation. -Well, you started it. -No. No, actually that would be the LAPD officer who pointed a gun at my head. And how did that make you feel? How would it make you feel? Whoa, let's be honest, it would be very unlikely that I would find myself in that situation. So you think the LAPD has a race problem? I think that LA County has a race problem, which is why I'm running for sheriff. Then why did you offer Johnson a deal? Because he offered me something much more valuable. The white vote? Names. Links to other cases that I've had sitting on my desk. I promise you when this is all over, LA County will be a much safer place for everyone. Great. So why are you telling me? Because what you did was not wrong. Running down Detective Johnson, that was the result of great natural instincts and sharp detective work. So why the court order? Why the depositions? Why am I talking to you? Like I said, you did nothing wrong. Your godfather, as acting sheriff, he had no business getting involved. He used department resourcesfor personal reasons. He's gonna pay the price. I want deputies like you to be the new face of this department. Of my department. With all due respect, what you see as a personal motivation was in actuality a sheriffbelieving in one of his deputies and having the courage to fight for justice regardless of political backlash. That is why this is his department and it is not gonna change. Now, if you don't mind, I've got paperwork. So do I. Just left the scene of a drive-by near Athens. I heard about that. There was three of 'em? All at the same time? Four, actually. But no victims. -Someone sending a message? -Maybe. Talk to me. Deputy Harris asked me to help identify a suspect in holding at Lennox. ID was a fake, so I asked my contacts at State to run the face. He's Kaito Hamanaka. Japanese, dual citizen, educated in the States. Man's got organized crime connections here and at home, and recently started doing business with the cartels in Mexico. Feds think he's consolidating power to become the cocaine supplier for Southeast Asia. That's why he's here. Closing the deal. So he's in booking at Lennox right now? Yes, sir. Well, he's got some dangerous friends. And there's money on the line. What are you thinkin'? They're not gonna let it lie. If he's still in booking then he made his call. There's still no arrests on those drive-bys. No, most of Lennox is still out on the hunt. And they happened after booking this guy. -Get SEB down there now. -On it. Make sure the Feds know we've got this guy. Copy. Yo, Harris. Look what I found. Don't get too close though. He's ripe. You really do have a way with people, Carter. This is harassment. Man, you came up to me. Not my problem you were in possession. Man, that ain't mine. This guy planted that on me. Yeah? I'll call the ACLU. Stop. All yours. Man, I didn't do nothing! Tell it to your mother. Same way I did last night. What took you so long? Hey, Bill. Joseph, the driver you brought in today, where is he? He's in holding. He's cartel connected, and may have some people coming to get him. Are you sure? He was asleep last time I checked. Quickly and quietly move him into his own cell, post extra deputies at the station entrance. I'm five minutes away. Cade's coming with SEB. Okay. Boot, what's happening? -I gotta move him. -Who? Hey, guard! I'm hungry. Shut up. I'm starving, bro. Not my problem, bro. What you say to me? Say it again, bro. I didn't hear you. I think you did. Hey! Hey! Knock it off! Open this up. Hey, get off! You wanna get maced? You wanna get shot? Easy. Take it easy. Show us the way out. Buzz me out. You ready? Scalpel. Dr. Reyes, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry. Paula! Paula! Dr. Reyes? One... two... three. Okay. Let's start again. They have a gun and took Carter! They? Minnick! Harris. You get him moved? He broke out of holding with another prisoner. What? They took Carter hostage. How the hell did that happen? I don't know. They got a gun. Okay, are they still in the building? Yeah, I think so. Listen to me and stay focused. I need you to seal the perimeter, I'm gonna secure the armory, you got that? Seal the perimeter. I got it. Grover! Harris! Code 3 11-99. Shots fired. Shots fired. Station lockdown. Get everybody out that's not armed. You, come with me. Move. Let's go. All units be advised. Shots fired at Lennox Station. Repeat, shots fired at Lennox Station. This is the sheriff. All units in the vicinity converge on Lennox Station. Hold tight. It's okay. I need 902 to booking now! Grover, you all right? Hold tight, buddy, okay? Get us outta here. Get in! Get in! Get in! Go! Let's go. Dispatch, this is Air 1. I have a white sedan in a parking lot. Doors wide open. Suspect vehicle located, abandoned. Vermont and 123rd. One confirmed dead inside. They ditched the vehicle for another one. Witness reports suspects fleeingin a burgundy SUV. I've got a burgundy SUV driving erratically southbound on Alvarado. They're coming right back at us. Grab the M4. Don't stop. Run it. That's gotta be them. Lose them. Do what you have to do. Hey, get outta the way! Secure the driver. Show me your hands now! Hands now! On the ground! -Not gonna say it again! -Get on the ground! Lay on your stomach. First smart thing you did all day. Son of a bitch. Is everyone okay? Yeah. What about Deputy Grover? I heard he was taken to St. Regents. Any updates? Just got out of his surgery. He's gonna be okay. Bullet didn't rupture any vital organs. -Thank God. -Did you get the guy? Guys. Yeah. SEB's sweeping upthe rest of their operation now. -Long day. -No kidding. I've had my hands full since the second I walked in. What's wrong? I... I had a moment. What do you mean? A moment. While doing some routine surgery. Deja vu? Yeah, exactly. Just a little PTSD, out of nowhere. Are you okay? Yeah, I am now. But at the time... I'll be honest, it scared me. Well, after everything you went through, it's natural. Yeah, I know but I'm a surgeon. I cut people open for a living. You told me once that in your job there's no room for distraction, it requires total focus. I remember. Well, it's the same for me. You know, an accountant makes a mistake, they just press delete. I slip up and... But you got through it. Yeah. Like I said, it was just a moment. Well, there might be more. PTSD likes to circle back. I know. And I'm prepared for that. But today... today taught me I can deal with it. I know you can. -I'm proud of you, honey. -Thank you. Dr. Reyes, please call OR 3. Dr. Reyes, OR 3. Sounds like you gotta go. Yeah, we'll talk tonight. I love you. I love you, too. I don't normally say things like this. I'm not trying to get all up in my feelings with you, but... I'm proud of you, boot. You did good today. You're making a lot of progress. You sure you're not just saying that so you can push me through my training, get that promotion of yours? See, that's exactly why I don't give you compliments, 'cause you'd be feeling yourself too much. -Is that what I'm doing? -Yeah, that's exactly what you're doing. But it's all right. Imma let you slide 'cause you got a lot of paperwork to do and I don't want you gettin' distracted. You tried it. I think what you meant to say is that wehave a lot of paperwork to do. Nah, with evals coming up, I think I'm gonna take a step back, you know, take more of a supervisory role. Do you know how much paperwork is in there? Don't stay too late, boot. I'll review your work in the morning. She is not joking. If you need me, you know where to find me. Deputy Minnick. Thank you. Well, turns out that Hamanaka was on his way to seal the deal with the cartel brass when he got pulled over. I mean, like, five minutes away. It's his own damn fault. The DMV handbook says to always use your turn signal. Page one. Hey, any update on Camilla and Roberto? Teresa left a message. And? Haven't listened to it yet. Why not? Well, I got this rule I like to stick to. One catastrophe at a time. You're in the wrong business, brother. Well, think positive. You and Teresa have a strong case. You're great parents, and those kids are in your corner. Yeah, well, tell that to the judge. What's up, Bishop? Just got word from SEB. They intercepted a drug shipment out of Long Beach. Hamanaka's contacts are in custody. Not bad for a day's work. Most sheriffs hope for one of these victories in an entire term. I'll type up the report. Some office you got here. Dad? Not bad, kid. Feel like I'm in the President's office. You okay? What are you doing here? I thought I'd come downand say hi to some of the guys. That's great. Hey, I got donuts. Don't worry, your mother knows I'm here. Mom's been gone for over three years now. You remember that, right? Yeah. Are you still running for sheriff? Yeah. That's good. One thing a man doesn't need is regrets. Says the one person I've never heard regret a thing his whole damn life. Dropped out of rodeo clown school. I regretted that. What? Summer after high school, I wanted to be a rodeo clown. You didn't know that, did you? No. I guess it would've been like what you ended up doing anyway. A rodeo clown's job is to jump in the ring when things go wrong. Make themselves the target to save others. How's that any different from what we do around here? Let me fix you here. Thank you. -That's Maggie. -Hey. Hey, Mags, I'm sittin' with your grandad. We're just ta... What's the matter, honey? Maggie. Calm down, okay? Take a deep breath. I'll call you right back. -What's wrong? -I don't know. saying that the potential misconduct does involve the misuse of department resources. The Sheriff appears to have been compromised in his official decision-making by personal relationships and favors. Turn the damn thing off, son. Not a chance. Is this something you think the sheriff should resign over? I-I'm not here to wag my finger or pass moral judgment. It is my job, however, to look into any behavior public or private, of an elected official to faithfully carry out civic obligations. It's all crap. You're in the game now. Don't take this stuff personal. It's not personal. It's only about power. You still here? Yeah, I got homework, man. All right. Well... homework's for school kids. Give Adams something to do in the morning. You keep thinking like a newbie, you're gonna stay a newbie. -Man, Minnick is gonna... -Minnick's not your mommy. Thanks... for today. It's my own damn fault, I shouldn't have gone in there and tried to break things up. Guys are never gonna let me live this one down. You were just doing your job, man. Nah, man, I should've just tased both of them and then kept drinking my coffee. There will be payback for what they pulled, so... Two guys died and Hamanaka's going to supermax for the rest of his life. It feels like plenty of payback to me. Yeah, not them. Talking about the next piece of trash we bring in here. You get rid of one and another one just crawls out from under a rock takes his place. They're cockroaches, man. They're cockroaches. And we bring 'em in here and we feed 'em three square meals a day on the taxpayer's dime. So... who's the chump? Anyhow, today... you showed me that you're the real deal. -Thanks. Man, I... -I mean it. It's one thing to tag along, get a few beers, but... today you became one of us. There are people out there who get how the world works, and there are people who don't. You get it. Not sure exactly what I get. You will. All right, man, come on, get your ass outta that chair. Let me buy you a drink. Come on. There you go. She's gonna kill me. Is Maggie okay? She says she is. You don't believe her. I told her not to worry. It'll all be over soon. Riley got what she wanted. What does that mean? Well, maybe you saw it coming, I was gonna tell you tonight that I decided to run for sheriff. But not anymore. I'm done. You're what? I'm not running, honey. Bill. Riley's out for blood. She'll dig through all my old cases. Every complaint. And if that doesn't work, she'll come after you. I can't let that happen. I won't. So that's it. Do you remember our second date? Not bottles night. Olvera Street? Dancing in the plaza. 'Course I remember. What does that ha... Walking back to the car that night, that guy tried to grab my ass. You broke his nose. I can handle myself. I know. You're a fighter. It's what I love about you. I still am. You say that now, but Maggie... She said she's okay because she is. So unless you're afraid... Yeah. That's it. That's the look I wanna see when someone's coming after you. Bill Hollister, you're running for sheriff because you are the best man for the job. Since you've taken over, this city is safer, morale is higher. You're gonna run and you're gonna win. And your family's gonna be right beside you. I wouldn't have it any other way. Let's do this. I love you.
