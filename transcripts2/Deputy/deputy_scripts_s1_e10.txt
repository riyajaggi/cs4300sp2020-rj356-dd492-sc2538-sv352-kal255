 Previously on Deputy... Shot a hostage. Destroyed a family. Think before you shoot. How about you give me some tips instead of telling me how bad I'm doing? I'm a sheriff's deputy. -My name is Joseph-- -Get down on the ground! Asking me to look into an LAPD case on your old buddy is no small ask. Can you point to the man you work for? Turn around, Detective.

 I'm finding it harder and harder to justify being in a relationship where I'm chastised for being me. My gender is non-binary. And Genevieve couldn't accept that. Their grandmother contacted DCSF. Grandmother? Yeah, she wants to see them. It's my understanding Sheriff Hollister has no plans of running for reelection. I consider this my insurance policy. So, you're running now? Nothing's ever completely off the table, Jerry. District Attorney Riley, who exactly wins

 when the DA refuses to go after a murderer? I have to think about the big picture, Sheriff. I've handed you the guaranteed conviction of a corrupt cop. How are you not running with this? Prosecuting an LAPD officer in court will create a media circus, for weeks. The citizens of Los Angeles County deserve better. Well, the badge stands for more than words. If we don't stand for rule of law, then who will? LAPD and the Sheriff's Department need to be working with one another, not against. So then what do you propose? I propose that we offer him a plea. Listen, we spare the city the spectacle. Detective Johnson just disappears. I'm not cosigning this. The call is mine. That's true. However, I doubt a public conflict between the sheriff and the DA will be any less disruptive to the county than an LAPD officer going to jail for a crime he absolutely committed. Are you threatening me? I don't threaten, Miss Riley. I just let it be known I won't back down from a fight. We cannot turn a blind eye to corruption within our ranks. Period. And if you attempt to make this case go away, we will be having words in a very public way. Will you be telling the public that your godson, Joseph Harris, is good friends with the key witness against Johnson, and that Harris had a gun pulled on him by an LAPD officer just prior, clearly biasing him, circumstances that you ignored when you prioritized the case that your godson pushed you to investigate? Your first mistake was to think I'd roll over while you sought a PR victory instead of defending the law. Your second mistake was bringing my family into this. This isn't over. I'm a lawyer. Everything is negotiable. Everything except the truth. Did you get my milkshake? We both got tacos and chips. Didn't have enough for a shake. Should have just got me my milkshake. Dude just left his windows wide open. That's trust. Come on. Come on! Check it out. He left his backpack in the back seat. Grab it. What if he comes? Do you wanna keep eating off the dollar menu? I can't reach. I got it. Grab it. Go, go, go, go! Get out of my way! Split up. Hey! Give me that bag before I kill you. You remember her, right, Roberto? Grandma? Kind of. She's old. "She's old." You're excited though, right? To see her, hang out? -Yeah. -Camilla? Can I bring Snuffy? Of course you can. Okay, you got your stuff? You have gotten so big! So handsome, and so pretty. I'm Cade. No. This is my wife Teresa. Thank you so much. Everything you've done for my grandkids. I'm grateful. It's been too long since I've seen these two. Why don't you take them out to the car and let me talk to the Wards for a minute? Yes, of course. Let's go, my sweets. I'll see you a little later, okay? It's gonna be fine. Bye, sweetie. Bet it was hard for Carmen when her daughter got mixed up with Sombra. Yeah, they didn't speak for a long time. I know she's their grandmother but to them, she's a complete stranger. Roberto and Camilla are in good hands. It's a few hours. I'll be with 'em. You have nothing to worry about. -We know. Thank you. -You have my number. It's just the two of us. Feels weird. It does. Josie! Josie, you home? You all right, sir? It's the badge, isn't it? It's intimidating. I know. You are the sheriff. I am. But I'm not gonna interrogate you, so... Okay. Doesn't mean I won't ask questions, but I trust my daughter and she seems to think you're all right. Thank you, sir. Do I need to remind you to, treat Maggie with respect, get her home on time, any of that stuff? No, sir, you don't. Then we're gonna get along just fine, Wyatt. Because I know that you know that I know what it's like to be a teenage boy. You know what I'm getting at, right? I don't like surprises. So as long as you get that, we're good. -Here we are. -Hey, guys. Hi, Wyatt. I'm Paula. Hi, Mrs. Hollister. It's nice to meet you. I'm Grandma. Hey, lunch is ready. That's great. It smells crazy good. I was just saying to Wyatt... Did I say something wrong? Let's eat. You know, this reminds me of when Jorge met Bill. -He did not like you. -He loved me. He also did that first night what you have to do for your daughter right now, which is respect her choices and give Wyatt the benefit of the doubt. I will. But after, I'm calling Jorge, having words. Wyatt has an earring. Hello? Miss Minnick? Hey, Isobel. What's happening? We still on for study Sunday? I need your help. I'm sorry, Miss Minnick, I messed up. Okay, easy. What's going on? I didn't know who else to call. I... I stole this guy's backpack. - Izzy! I know. It was stupid. I'm stupid. You're not stupid. You made a poor choice. This was one of those. I thought it would be something I could pawn but it's full of cash. And the guy who the bag belongs to is after it and I'm afraid if I give it back, he'll hurt me. -What guy? -He had a gun, Miss Minnick. What's that chiming sound? It-it's the phone that was inside the bag. I-I-I think it's an alarm. It-it keeps going off. I can't get it to stop. That's not an alarm. Where are you? - At home. - Okay, listen to me. I'm coming for you but I need you to get out of there. Do you hear me? Turn off the phone quick and get out. He's tracking the phone, Izzy. Get out. Right now. My God. I know you're in there, you little thief. He found me. Get out the back. Now. Isobel, can you hear me? Open the damn door! You know you robbed the wrong Mexican, right? I got you. Come on. Are you okay? Izzy! -Hey. -Hey. I've been meaning to talk to you about... I got Bill's memo. It's all good. -That's it? -Yeah, that's it. They, them. I got you. If anybody gives you any trouble, you let me know. All right. What's up with all the matching Simba ink? Tattoo shop have a special or something? We're the kings of the jungle, baby. -Haven't you heard? -Harris, let's go. Don't worry. You'll have your own soon enough. Boot. Move your ass. What is up with you? I got a girl in trouble. One of mine. - One of yours? - Former student. I've been helping her get her life back on track for the last few months. She's really important to me and I'm not about to lose anybody else. All right, lay it on me. Name's Isobel. Called for help. -Now she's gone missing. -What happened? She lifted a bag she shouldn't have. Owner wants it back. He's got a gun and he already used it. Whatever it is, not now. You're gonna wanna see this. the days of a corrupt and lawless Sheriff's Department are over. No more insiders. It's time for a reformer. An agent of change, someone to come in and clean house. So today, I humbly... announce my candidacy for sheriff of Los Angeles County. -What are you thinking? -I shoulda seen this coming. She'll destroy everything we've worked for. Whatever you think of me, Bill, an outsider running this department isn't right. This may be the first time I've ever agreed with you, Jerry. Not about you and me anymore. Never was. It was like this when I came home. I mean, I went out for smokes and then I came back and it was like this. I couldn't have been gone more than 20 minutes. You must be Josie. I'm Deputy Minnick. This is Harris. We're looking for Isobel. Same. Look at my damn door. Something to do with her, I know. Someone's after her. We need to find her first. Minnick? You're the one tutors Isobel at the library, aren't you? Yeah, she talks about you a lot. So who did this then? Yeah, I'm not sure. Is anything missing? Yeah, I'm outta weed. Okay, what about a phone? The guy we're after was tracking her on it. No. Who are you? Tina. Isobel's friend. We got separated. I thought she'd be here. If Isobel's in trouble, you can bet this one's mixed up in it. Yeah, no one asked you, Josie. Why don't you go back to collecting your disability checks and shut the hell up? Get out of my house. No one asked you to be here. Okay, show me her room. I found her phone. This must be the burner. I was the one who told Izzy to grab the bag. It's my fault. Helluva home life. Yeah, Izzy caught Josie as her foster mom a couple years back. Josie wanted a check from the state. Izzy wanted a guardian that wasn't gonna ask too many questions. -She's smart and hardworking. -Like you. Yeah, not even that. I mean, it's hard for a girl who gets cycled through the system to trust, but she was brave enough to do that with me. I was helping her with her GED. We're gonna find her. Last thing I told my students before I left for Sheriff's, "Something bad happens, find me, and I'll find you." -That's what she did. -Yeah, but it's too late. If she'd have called me sooner, I could have prevented this. All right, you rewrite the past later. We gotta find her now. So where are we going? HOJ. Get this to Bishop. Where you at? Where you at? Come on, come on. She's somewhere around Eastern and Washington. Put everybody out there. Dead or alive. I don't care. I just need that money. Found this in Isobel's apartment. Belongs to the guy who's after her. You think you can get something off of it? Of course. Hey, is this about that missing girl? Isobel. Yeah. Okay. Look at this. The only photo on the hard drive is the money bag. It was texted to these two numbers. And those are registered to... Corey Edison and Adam Kemp. Are you serious? Edison and Kemp are guns for Los Cuchillos. Is that a tag? CADE No, that's their mark, a dragon tattoo. Where did Isobel get this bag? Whoa. That's a DMZ for gang affiliates. They must have started doing deals there. So she stole that bag and got herself in the middle of something big. Sure she isn't signed up? No, she's straight. No gangs. She pushed that life away. I think Isobel didn't know who she was stealing from. OSS has a shot caller in custody from Los Cuchillos. CRI. George. He might be willing to talk. He'll talk. Let's do it. They're both just so strong-headed. Maggie's gonna grow up, whether Bill likes it or not. Your father couldn't stand it when you started dating. You know, there's something about men and daughters. Why didn't he come? He'll come, he'll come when the rest of the family comes. You know, he's enjoying his quiet life now. Besides, I wanted a head start with you, honey. I wanna maximize mother-daughter time. Because you're worried about me. Mothers never stop worrying. You should realize that now. Doctors shouldn't bring work home with them. There's no patients here. Mom, it's been a long time since my job only involved helping patients. I mean, right now I'm just focused on saving jobs and, to be honest, I'm just... I'm not... I'm not even doing it too well. All right. Talk to your mama. What's wrong? It's my responsibility to make sure that these hospital budget cuts don't turn into layoffs. And so far, I've only saved one. My options are just fire ten nurses, one of whom is a year away from retirement, or just slash geriatrics and outsource radiology. It's just, it's a no-win scenario and I should have done it sooner but I was just so... -Traumatized. -Distracted. What does your father always say? If you have a problem, you're not-- looking at the situation from the right direction. All right. Need to change perspective. I've been focused on how to save money when I... I should have been focused on how to raise money. You're a genius. You got a solid rep with OSS, George. Now, we're hoping some intel made its way down to you. A civilian stumbled upon a bag full of cash that belonged to Los Cuchillos. At least, it went down on their turf. Nothin'? Are you livin' comfortable in here, George? So all that can all go away, if you don't start getting talkative. This is Isobel. Seventeen. Ward of the state. She picked up that bag, but she didn't know what it was. Don't know her. Don't know you. Ain't my business. You do you know her though, right? Maria. Your little girl. You lost her four years back. Yeah, I did my homework. You know, I came in here with a lot of sympathy for you. Respect even. Someone had helped her, maybe she'd be with us today. We are not here to blow up your spot. Or to take down your crew. I'm just wanna remove an innocent from a situation before it's too late. Do not let what happened to Maria happen to Isobel. Look, I heard they're out looking for someone, took a big stash from him. Who's him? Tony. Enforcer. Maybe trying to come up since I been on the inside. He was with Los Cuchillos, but he does some outside business. How do we find him? I don't know how to find that fool, all right? But I know a couple dudes that work with him. All right. Names and numbers. Twice in one day, Sheriff. And to think you've been so hard to lock down until now. Well, getting played doesn't make me shy. How exactly... did I play you? You knew you were announcing for my job when we met this morning. Why not give me the heads-up? Must've slipped my mind. See, I think this is all just a game to you. Well, I'm here to tell you that my department and the lives of the people who work here are not chess pieces, Miss Riley. I never said they were. I've just become aware of inconsistencies in leadership ethics and I feel that my brand of unison, cohesion, and efficiency could do wonders here. Nepotism and cowboy diplomacy have no place in a Sheriff's Department, I'm sure you would agree. Personally, I got a soft spot for cowboy diplomacy. But with nepotism, we agree. Fortunately, that's not what this was. Deputy Harris was right. LAPD was pinning a murder on an innocent man. Here's how I see it. You're letting a corrupt police officer walk for your own political benefit as you aim to run a department that you've never worked in and you think you can do it better than all the people who've climbed their way up from the inside. Think of me as the antidote to a systemic cancer of complacency and backwards leadership that promotes dissent amongst our law enforcement agencies. I am gonna unite this county because the time of renegade justice is over. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Sorry, you and I, we're done. The Johnson case, however, is far from over. Thanks for stopping by. Yeah. What's up? Need your help, Sheriff. What damn it? No, I haven't. But if I do, I swear to God I'll kill her myself. Yeah, damn straight. Hey, come here. Where you going? Give me back my bag, bitch! Aah! Yeah, you keep runnin'. You really think you can win? Against Hollister, we'll see. Against you, easily. Never were one to pull punches. Well, my dad always said, "If you're gonna punch, punch." Okay, how's this? You're just a suit, Carol. You don't know the first thing about running this department. Bow out now before you get burned. There you go, Jerry. Although, one might argue that an outsider's perspective is exactly what this old boys' club needs. Less ego, more results. How's that for a suit? Perhaps I'm underestimating you. -Most men do. -We have a common cause. Hollister? Nah, he's more of an obstacle the way I see it. We could remove that obstacle together. I've got plenty of ammunition against you both. And besides, Jerry, haven't you heard? The future is female. There's no movement on that black Suburban yet. Let me ask you something. Say your daughter has a boy come over for lunch. She's eight. Okay. Well, add six years, and then imagine he comes over. His name's Wyatt. Ooh. Boyfriend? Looks that way. I mean, you throw a warning shot over the bow. You tell him what's what, right? Had a few of those when I was a kid. Me, too. Any of 'em stick? Nope. You? Maggie wanted me to stand down, but, I just, I couldn't help myself. You know, you don't have kids, you're living for today. You add kids, and everything... Everything matters. You really think she's out on the street right now? Nope, she's too smart for that. But Sheriff and Cade are sitting on that house, so we're out here thinking on 'it. "Thinking on it"? I think better when I drive. You do, too. You just don't know it yet. And if Tony doesn't have Isobel yet, then his only chance at finding her is bringing in reinforcements. If they move, then they take us to her. Or him. Either way it's a win. She was lucky to have a teacher like you. Yeah, it goes both ways. We gotta get ahead of Tony. Figure out where Isobel would go if she wanted to be safe. Why doesn't she just go to the nearest police station and have them call you? She stole that bag. There's no way she's bringing anybody in law side if it isn't me. -What's up? -Yo. I got her. For real? Get everybody over to the Caldas Library now. All right, we got movement. - Target on the move. - Black Suburban. License plate three-two-five Papa-Charlie-Echo. Heading south on Nicholas. They must have eyes on Isobel. -Where are they going? -I don't know. What's East on Clark? If we knew that, we could beat them there. Caldas Library. That's where I study with her on Sundays. -Are you sure? -Yeah, I'm sure. Hey, Sheriff, they're headed to Caldas Library. Meet you there. I need an airship. And I need an ETA on OSS. Airship is en route and OSS is six minutes out. Yeah, copy that. -Get out of my way. -Hey! Folks, I need you to get up quickly and quietly. Follow the deputy behind the counter. Quickly. Thank you. Sir? Come on. Let's go. This doesn't look good. We just got made. - Everybody, right this way. - Don't panic. -Everybody keep calm. -Everybody stay calm. Sheriff's Department is on the scene. Stay low. Stay low. You Code 4? Yeah. Whatcha gonna do with that? You ever shot somebody? 'Cause I have. Izzy. Dude's not worth it. - He's trying to kill me. - I know. But what you do right now, that's on you. We can end this today. But if you pull that trigger, you're done. Your entire future dies with him. Been stealing just to get by. Doesn't have to be like that. You got a couple weeks until your GED. That's gonna open up a lot of doors for you. I don't want this life. Put down the gun. I got you, honey. I got you. Yes! -Hey-hey. -Hey! -What's up, buddy? -Hey. I'll take that. So, how'd it go? The kids had a great time. -And Camilla, too? -Camilla, too. It's great to hear. Carmen said to thank you again. It really meant the world to her to get to spend time with her grandkids. That's great. Thank you. Just doing my job. Speaking of which, I'm late for an interview. Call you tomorrow with the full download? Yeah, sounds good. All right. Bye, kids. -Bye. -Bye. So? So... you had fun? Yeah, it was great. We watched Disney Plus and she made chilaquiles. - I love chilaquiles. Hey, Camilla,  where's your elephant? Did you forget Snuffy? Snuffy's at Grandma's. He's gonna live there so I'll get to play with him next week. Next week? Grandma said we're gonna see her all the time. Is that cool? What happens now? Well, the detectives will ask you some questions but I'll be there with you. Am I going to jail? Tony was a bad man and that money was tainted. You don't need to worry about going to jail. -What you need to worry about-- -You don't need to tell me. Tell you what? I need to start earning back my integrity. I know I do. Is that what I was gonna say? "Real integrity is doing the right thing, "knowing that nobody's gonna know -whether you did it or not." -"...did it or not." And what's that? It's that Oprah quote you used to start class with. Look at you remembering every word. I remember everything you told us. I didn't know what integrity was before I met you. I'm gonna do better. Starting right now. And I'm gonna help you. It's been too long. I'm sorry, Mags, I really am. I should've handled that differently with Wyatt. I got protective instead of being trusting of you and your decisions. Thanks, Dad. I've been thinking about it... and I can't imagine what it must be like watching a child grow up. Hard. There are days I wish I could slow it down. But I can't. I'm getting older. I'm almost 15. I need to be able to have boys in my life who aren't completely afraid of you. A little afraid of me is okay though, right? Wouldn't have it any other way. I do need you to give Wyatt another chance though. For me. Whoa. I'd do anything for you, honey. 'Course I will. You're just growing up so fast. I get scared. Sorry. Yo. You been here all night? I came in early. I wanted to clear the inbox. Yeah, I get diving into work after a breakup. But you're taking time for yourself though, right? Trying to at least. If you ever wanna get in the water, give me a shout. I'll take you for a surf. There's no better way for clearing your head. Thanks, Cade. Yeah, I, I might take you up on that. You wanted to see me? Yeah, sit. I sent some deputies over to pick up Isobel's former foster mother. Think it's safe to say she's not part of the system anymore. Well, that's good to hear. How many years were you a teacher? Six. Why? Wanted to know how long it takes for someone to know. To know what? To know exactly what a kid needs. What to say or do, how hard to push. It's a gift. I don't know about a gift. I was just doing my job. I don't think you've ever just done anything. That's why I wanted to see you. I've been going through this mountain of Sheriff Bradford's unfinished paperwork... and it seems you're due for a promotion. Yeah, well, I don't think Sheriff Bradford-- Which isn't why I'm offering one to you. In my short time here, I've seen more than enough. Selflessness and initiative... that some don't manage their entire career. So that's why I'd like to offer you-- Sir. I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt you, um... but I gotta be honest with you, I don't wanna know what the promotion is. -You don't? -I appreciate it, of course. More than you know. But no matter what it is, I'm gonna turn it down, so, the way I'm thinking, it's better not to know. And why would you turn it down? Because I wanna finish what I started. And what's that? Training Joseph. He's gonna be a great deputy. But the work isn't finished yet. Like I said... you've never just done anything. Promotion's here when you're ready. Thank you, sir. I owe you a second thank you. - For what? - For believing in me, for helping out with Isobel with no questions and no conditions. That's all this is really about. The big wins... the unimaginable losses. We're here to help each other. Otherwise... we're just passin' time. Deputy Minnick. There you are. I've got a new assignment for you. This district attorney... You're not coming? I'm not. No. But thank you for the invite. And the opportunity. I appreciate it. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I think so. This isn't just an invite to an open bar event. This is my way of saying you'll have a place in my command structure. If you're elected. WhenI'm elected. I really appreciate everything you've done for me and for the confidence you have in me. But I've been doing some soul searching and the thing I've come up with is that what I really wanna do, what I am going to do, is my job. And right now, my job is to start a shift with a young deputy that's in need of my guidance. I can't argue with you wanting to do your job. I respect that. But I'm not gonna lie to you. You're making a very big mistake. District Attorney Riley is running for sheriff now, too. She and Bill, regardless of whether he's running or not will tear each other apart. And when the dust settles... I'll be the last man standing. At that point, you can either stand beside me... or in my way. Yes, sir. Mark Greenburg from theLA Times -returning your call. -Great. Thanks. Mark. Sheriff Hollister. I wanted to talk to you about that LAPD detective the Sheriff's Department arrested. Yeah, Detective Johnson, that's him. Word on the street is the DA's lookin' to cut a deal. How'd you like to hear my side of the story? Volleyball tournament in Venice tomorrow. -You are coming. -Venice is my spot but volleyball is-- it's not my game. You're gonna miss out on a lot of thirsty badge bunnies. Work comes first, you know why? 'Cause they're the ones who pay. Exactly. So I will catch you and your badge bunnies later. Are you sure this is about work and not, I don't know, about Minnick? I get the feeling, like, there's something going on between you two. Yeah, well, feelings are not facts. And there's definitely nothing. Carter. -Hi. -Go home. Okay. -What? -Watch out for that one. -I hear you. -I don't want you to hear me. I want you to listen. Let's go. Hold on. What's up? Break down your shotgun. Really? Did I stutter? All right. Gotcha. Operable and patrol ready. All right. Do it again. Keep your eyes on the street, Deputy.
