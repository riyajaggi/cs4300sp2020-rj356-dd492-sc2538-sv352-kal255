 Baywatch (1989–2001): Season 1, Episode 4 - Message in a Bottle - full transcript 
 Hobie is once again caught in the middle of Mitch and Gayle's custody battle when Gayle gets a new job at a law firm in Ohio, and Mitch tells her that he will not give up Hobie without a fight. However, both Mitch and Gayle must put aside their personal differences to help the rest of the Baywatch squad find Hobie and two of his friends when they get stranded on a channel island that is the hideout of a pair of modern day pirates. Meanwhile, Eddie and Shauni squabble with each other again after they're reluctantly paired for a 24-hour shift, where they encounter an naive and obnoxious tourist couple stranded on the beach and are forced to take them along with them on their beach patrol
