I KNOW ALL THIS. IT'S JUST THAT WHEN HE LEFT, HE MADE A POINT OF TELLING ME TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU. -WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT I DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY TO KEEP AN EYE ON ME. -ALLISON, THE RULE BOOK IS REAL SIMPLE. YOU DON'T DATE YOUR BEST FRIEND'S GIRL. -OH, IS THAT WHAT WE DID? DATE? WHEN I WAS DRIVING DOWN HERE, I HIT SOME TRAFFIC AND I HAD SOME FLASHES ABOUT HOW THE WEEKEND MIGHT GO. AND THE WORST SCENARIO WAS THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY CHEMISTRY BETWEEN YOU AND ME. IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH CRAIG. WE ARE NOT KIDS ANYMORE. -HEY, WAIT A SECOND. WAIT. DON'T WALK OF HERE JUST BECAUSE CRAIG AND I HAD A FIGHT. -I CAME TO HAVE FUN, AND I'M NOT FUN ANYMORE. -OKAY, OKAY. LOOK, I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW? I WANT YOU TO STAY. I CAN'T STAY. SAY GOODBYE TO THE GUYS FOR ME, OKAY? GOD. [SAD MUSIC] I'M SORRY ABOUT ALLISON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING. INVITING HER HERE WAS A MISTAKE. -NO. NO, IT WAS GOOD TO SEE HER. IT WAS REAL GOOD TO SEE HER. -HEY, GUYS. TONY: CRAIG. OH. THIS IS GREAT. ISN'T THIS GREAT? SIT. YOU GUYS DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS. -DO WHAT? -BRING US TOGETHER LIKE THIS.

I FOUND IT WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE CHECK. -SEE? WHAT DID I TELL YOU? BRINGING THESE TWO TOGETHER WAS A GREAT IDEA. -IT STILL DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT YOU DID TO BEGIN WITH. NO, AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I STILL FEEL ABOUT ALLISON, WHO LEFT, BY THE WAY, AFTER OUR FIGHT AND DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH EITHER ONE OF US. -I SUPPOSE YOU BLAME ME FOR THAT. -WHO ELSE IS THERE TO BLAME, PAL? I JUST SHOWED UP MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS. I CAME OVER TO HELP YOU WITH THE DORY. -HEY, HEY, BOYS, NOW, COME ON-- -WITH THAT KIND OF HELP, I'LL GET AN OUTBOARD MOTOR. THAT'S FINE.
