 ♪ I'M ALWAYS HERE -THORPE: SO, WE WANTED WOOD. WE DISCOVERED THAT THOSE EARLY FIBER GLASS TOWERS WERE EXUDING SOME KIND OF TOXIC FUMES CAUSING OUT LIFEGUARDS TO PASS OUT. -FASCINATING. -WORK WITH ME, MCCLAIN, THIS IS HISTORY. SO, THE COUNTY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT GRAIN OF WOOD. I SAID, "WELL, NAUGHTY PINE WOULD BE NICE." I MEAN, OF COURSE REDWOOD IS THE CHOICE, STRONG, RESILIENT, 100% CALIFORNIA GROWN. -HOBIE: DAD, HE'S A BOY DOG, HE DOESN'T WEAR RIBBONS. -YOU WANT HIM TO LOOK NICE FOR GINA'S PORTRAIT, DON'T YOU? COME ON, ASSIST HIM. [DOG CRYING] -DAD, THE OTHER DOGS WILL THINK HE IS A CREEP. -YEAH, BUT THIS IS FOR KATIE'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT. HE'LL LOOK REAL PRETTY. [BARKING] OWE! HEY! OKAY, OKAY. NO RIBBON, COME ON BACK. [BARKING] -SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ROCKY. -COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, COME ON, COME ON. [DOG BARKING] -EARTHQUAKE! -RELAX, MCCLAIN, IT'S JUST A LITTLE SHIVER. -SHIVER? -GROWING PAINS OF MOTHER EARTH. WE SURVIVE EARTHQUAKES EVERY DAY. THE EARTH IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING, THE CRUST IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING. GIGANTIC PLATES INTERLOCKING, MOVING TOGETHER. MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO, THE PRIMAL MASS WAS FORCED TO PART, CREATING CONTINENTS AND ISLANDS. MCCLAIN, DID YOU KNOW THAT JAPAN WAS ONCE A PART OF FRESNO? -SHE'S BEEN BURIED. -WHAT? -LIQUEFACTION IS SHAKING AND TURNS THE BEACH INTO QUICKSAND. -I AM IMPRESSED, MCCLAIN, BUT A LITTLE SHIVER LIKE THAT... MCCLAIN, MCCLAIN! -DON'T PANIC, WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE. -I'M OKAY. -JUST HOLD ON. -I TOLD YOU, I'M FINE. -THORPE: HERE. -YOU MEAN, THE EARTHQUAKE DIDN'T JUST SUCK YOU UNDER? -OF COURSE NOT, I BURIED MYSELF. IT'S COOL AND IT'S SOOTHING AND IT REALLY TAKES OFF THE WEIGHT. -THORPE: HOW SOON YOU'RE DUE? -ANY DAY NOW. -I AM SURE THINGS WILL GO SMOOTH AS GLASS. -GINA. -TV: THE TREMOR REGISTERED ABOUT 5.0 ON THE RICHTER SCALE. -THE EARTHQUAKE'S OVER, YOU CAN COME OUT NOW. -GINA: NO, NEVER. [TV CONTINUES] -WE JUST HAD A LITTLE RUMBLE. THAT'S COMMON AROUND HERE. THERE'S SMOG AND A LOT LESS DANGEROUS. -HONEY, THAT WAS JUST A FORESHOCK. -A FORESHOCK? -YEAH, AS IN BEFORE THE BIG ONE. CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO FALL INTO THE OCEAN ANY MINUTE NOW. I KNEW WE SHOULD'VE NEVER LEFT NEW YORK. I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT. -WE'RE NOT GOING TO FALL INTO THE OCEAN, AND, EVEN IF WE DO, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR A SWIM. -KNOCK, KNOCK! -YEAH? -WE'RE GOING TO GO? I'VE BEEN WAITING ON YOU ABOUT 30 MINUTES. -COME ON. YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. COME ON. WELL... WE'RE A LITTLE NERVOUS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE THIS MORNING. I THINK I'D BETTER CANCEL OUT ON THE DIVE TODAY. -NO, NO, NO, NO, DON'T BE SILLY. YOU GUYS HAVE PLANNED THIS FOR A LONG TIME, YOU SHOULD JUST GO. -CRAIG: WHAT ABOUT YOU? -WELL, IF YOU'RE RIGHT, I'LL MEET YOU BACK HERE, AND, IF I'M RIGHT, I'LL MEET YOU AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. -PERISH THE THOUGHT. YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT YOUR SKYLIGHT HERE. I THINK THE QUAKE CRACKED A COUPLE OF PANES. -OKAY. -BYE. -BYE. GIVE ME THAT. -SHAUNI: IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO MOVE. I MEAN YOU'RE TAUGHT ALL YOUR LIFE THAT THERE'S NOTHING SAFER THAN STANDING ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET, RIGHT? BUT WE'VE BEEN LIED TO ALL OF OUR LIVES. -EXCUSE ME? -WHEN YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING, WHAT DO THEY SAY? THEY SAY DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE ON SOLID GROUND. WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD BE PLENTY WORRIED. -SHAUNI, IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION. -BUT IT UNDERMINES EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU SEE? -ALRIGHT, TIME OUT HERE. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? IT'S NOT THE EARTHQUAKE, IT'S NOT LIKE THE FIRST EARTHQUAKE YOU'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH. -THE GROUND ISN'T THE ONLY THING THAT IS SHAKY AROUND HERE, EDDIE. I'M TALKING ABOUT US. -US? WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THINGS ARE GREAT BETWEEN US. -WE'VE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER ALMOST EVERY NIGHT AND YOU SAY THAT YOU LOVE ME. -I DO LOVE YOU. -I NEED A COMMITMENT FROM YOU, EDDIE. -LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE TIME OR PLACE. CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT IT LATER? I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ON PATROL, OKAY? -NO, WE CAN'T. -I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. I MEAN, WE'RE HAPPY. THINGS ARE GOING GREAT. NEITHER ONE OF US WANTS TO SEE ANYBODY ELSE. WHAT MORE OF A COMMITMENT DO YOU WANT? -SHAUNI: I SEE. -WHAT, YOU SEE WHAT? -THAT THIS IS NOTHING SERIOUS, NOT FOR YOU ANYWAY. -WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? DO YOU WANT ME TO PROMISE THAT I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU AND THAT I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU? I CAN'T. NO ONE CAN. SHAUNI, COME ON! HEY, COME ON! WHAT DID I SAY? -ALL THE WRONG THINGS. -I WAS RIGHT, RIGHT? -EDWARD, YOU HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT WOMEN. -WHEN I WAS A KID AND I WAS ABOUT 10, IF I COULD'VE SEEN WHAT I'M DOING NOW, I WOULD HAVE DIED. -YOU WERE SUCH A STIFF? -OH, ALL OF THIS. WE'RE OUT HERE, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, WE ARE SUITED UP, WE'RE ABOUT TO JUMP INTO A WORLD OF ADVENTURE. -WORLD OF ADVENTURE, HUH! -THAT'S LIKE SEA HUNT, ONLY WE'RE HERE INSTEAD OF SITTING HOME WATCHING ON TV. I USED TO LOVE THAT SHOW. I SAW ALL 177 EPISODES. -YOU ACTUALLY COUNTED? -I LIKED THAT SHOW SO MUCH, I USED TO SIT AT HOME AND SCUBA DIVE IN MY BATHTUB WITH A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES AND A STRAW. -FRIGHTENING. -YEAH, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY SISTER WOULD PINCH MY STRAW. -HEY, YOU GUYS GOING DOWN FOR A SWIM? -NO, WE'RE... ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO A WORLD OF ADVENTURE. -YEAH. WELL, IF YOU SEE ANY HALIBUT DOWN THERE, SEND THEM OVER MY WAY, WILL YOU? -CRAIG: YOU GOT IT! -ALRIGHT. -FISHERMAN: WE'LL FIND ONE, ONE OF THESE DAYS. [LAUGHS] [PHONE RINGING] -HELLO? HI, GINA. [DOG CRYING] YEAH, WE'LL BE THERE IN 10 MINUTES. UM, MAKE THAT 15. YEAH, OKAY, BYE-BYE. GET BACK IN THAT TUB. [DOG CRYING] ROCKY! COME ON, GET IN THE TUB. COME ON. [DOG CRYING] [DEEP VIBRATING SOUND] OUCH! [SCREAMS] [WOMAN SCREAMING] -MITCH: GET OUT OF HERE, COME ON! GET OUT! -GET OUT! [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] -COME ON. -WOW... WOW! WOW! [SCREAMING] -MAN ON RADIO: THE BIGGEST EARTHQUAKE IN 50 YEARS ROCKED LOS ANGELES TODAY, KNOCKING DOWN HOUSES, DESTROYING SEVERAL FREEWAY OVERPASSES, DISABLING PHONE SERVICE TO THE SOUTH LAND, BREAKING GAS MAINS AND SETTING NUMEROUS FIRES AND TAKING AT LEAST FIVE LIVES. THE GAS COMPANY SAYS IF YOU SMELL GAS AND CAN GET TO THE SHUT-OFF VALVE, DO SO IMMEDIATELY. ALSO, LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE REQUESTED THAT, IF YOU DO HAVE PHONE SERVICE, PLEASE, LIMIT YOUR CALLS TO EMERGENCIES ONLY. POWER LINES ARE ALSO DOWN ALL OVER LA COUNTY. PRELIMINARY REPORTS PUT DAMAGE ESTIMATES IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THAT NUMBER IS SURE TO CLIMB AS PER THE REPORTS COME IN. THE EARTHQUAKE IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR HUNDREDS OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS WHICH ARE CLOGGING THE FREEWAYS AND MAKING IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR FIRE AND RESCUE CREWS TO GET GOING. -MAN: WATCH YOUR ARM. -MAN #2: I'LL HAVE IT FOR YOU... -MAN: YOU'LL FEEL BETTER. HOW'S THAT? -KMF-295 TO UNIT 211, COME IN. KMF-295 TO UNIT 211, COME IN. -COME ON, EDDIE, ANSWER. -NO, I NEED THE EARTHQUAKE CONTINGENCY PLAN. -VARDEMAN: HAVE YOU ASKED LIEUTENANT O'QUINN? -YES! I HAVE ASKED LIEUTENANT O'QUINN, WHO TOLD ME TO CALL CAPTAIN DELCOURT, WHO TOLD ME TO CALL CAPTAIN BERGANZA, WHO TOLD ME TO CALL YOU! -JESUS, EVERYBODY'S HEADING TO THE EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER. I'D TRIED LIEUTENANT BUCHANNON. HE'S YOUR BEST MAN. -I CAN'T TRY LIEUTENANT BUCHANNON, I AM LIEUTENANT BUCHANNON. -OH, GREAT. CAN YOU GIVE ME A COPY OF THE REPORT? EVERYBODY'S BEEN ASKING FOR IT. -NO. WE'RE ON OUR OWN. WHAT'S THIS? -THE TOWERS WE HEARD FROM ARE IN GREEN. THE TOWERS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH ARE IN RED. POSSIBLE TROUBLE SPOTS, THE PEDESTRIAN UNDERPASS AT CHAUTAUQUA, THE DRAINAGE CANALS, ANY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT BE TRAPPED ARE IN BLUE. AND ALTERNATE ROUTES IF THE HIGHWAY IS BLOCKED OR THE SAND IS LIQUEFIED. -YOU KNEW ALL ALONG IT'D BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE PLAN. -JUST HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. -WE'LL GIVE COPIES TO ALL AVAILABLE UNITS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE WE'RE FACING TILL WE HEAR FROM THE REST OF THE TOWERS. -YEAH... YOU HEARD FROM HOBIE? -NO, ALL THE PHONES ARE DEAD. BUT HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO. -OH, YEAH. CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? WE HAVE THREE UNITS SITTING IDLE IN THE GARAGE, I WANT THEM OUT ON THE SAND COMMUNICATING WITH OUR TOWERS. DICKENS, HALL... MCCLAIN, GET OUT THERE. TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE OUR EYES AND I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU REGULARLY. ALRIGHT, THAT'S IT. -MAN: OKAY. -WAIT A MINUTE. -I CAN'T, I HAVE TO GO. -I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DO. I KNOW HOW BAD YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE EDDIE IS OKAY, BELIEVE ME, I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT HOBIE, BUT WE'VE GOT A RESPONSIBILITY HERE. YOU ARE ON PATROL, NOT ON SEARCH OF EDDIE, OKAY? -I KNOW. -THAT SAID, I HOPE YOU FIND HIM. -EDDIE: TRY NOW! -GIVE ME YOUR HAND. -THANKS. OWE! -WOMAN: ALRIGHT. OH... ARE YOU ALRIGHT? -YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE. HOW ABOUT YOU? -AH... AH, NOT SO GOOD. -UH... THE PHONE. CAN YOU WALK? -DOES WADDLING COUNT? -PUT YOUR ARM... YOU'RE OKAY? WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND MAKE IT TO THAT TOWER OVER THERE. -CORT: OH, MAN! SWIMMING THROUGH AN EARTHQUAKE, THAT WAS FUN. -GINA IS NEVER GOING TO COME OUT FROM UNDER THE BED. -NO KIDDING. [SUSPENSE MUSIC] -CRAIG: THEY ARE IN TROUBLE, LET'S GO. -EDDIE: ALRIGHT. EASY. OH, OH... OKAY. YOU HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE. -THANKS. HERE'S A BLANKET. -THANK YOU. -OKAY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? -FINE. -LOOK, I AM SORRY, THIS ISN'T VERY LUXURIOUS. -ANY PLACE I CAN LIE DOWN LOOKS GOOD TO ME. -RIGHT, LIE DOWN. HERE, JUST GO IN. OKAY. -CRAIG: HEY! HE'S DEAD. -DO YOU SMELL ROTTEN EGGS? -I SURE DO. -STICK THE REGULATOR IN YOUR MOUTH AND JUMP. -JUMP? -JUST DO IT, ALRIGHT? [SPLASH] [SPLASH] [GINA MOANING] [SIRENS WAILING AFAR] -HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME, PLEASE! -CRAIG: HEY, WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING? -CORT: IT SMELT LIKE HYDROGEN SULFIDE. ANOTHER FEW MORE SECONDS AND WE COULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS DEAD AS THEY ARE. THAT EARTHQUAKE WANTS TO RELEASE THE POCKET OF NATURAL GAS OR A BROKEN A PIPE OR SOMETHING. -CRAIG: THEN WHY DID WE LEAVE THE BOAT? LET'S GO BACK. WE'LL CALL IT IN, WE'LL WARN THE COASTGUARD. -NO, NO, CAN'T DO THAT. IF IT IS HYDROGEN SULFIDE, THAT STUFF IS JUST AS EXPLOSIVE AS IT IS POISONOUS. YOU START THAT BOAT AND WE'RE DEAD. -LET'S DIVE DOWN, LOOK FOR GAS BUBBLES NEAR THE SOURCE, WE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO. -SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. -EDDIE: PHONE'S DEAD. -OH! -THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. -BOY: HELP! OVER HERE, HELP ME! HURRY, I CAN'T MOVE! -OKAY, CLIMB ON, COME ON. THAT'S IT. [SUSPENSE MUSIC] -DON'T FALL ON ME. DON'T, DON'T, DON'T. DON'T, PLEASE, DON'T FALL ON ME. DON'T. [SCREAM] DON'T MOVE.

THE KID WAS CLIMBING ON A BOAT, DURING THE QUAKE AND HE FELL INTO THE WATER AND THE SURF SLAMMED AGAINST THE ROCKS. HE SLAMMED ME PRETTY GOOD TOO. -WELL, GO PUT ON SOME DRY CLOTHES, WE NEED YOU OUT THERE. -I'LL BE BACK. -MITCH, WE STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM OVER HALF OUR TOWERS. I WANT YOU TO CHECK THE CHOPPER UP AND GET AN OVERALL PICTURE. -SIR, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D RATHER STAY HERE AND COORDINATE THE REST OF THE EFFORT. IF I HEAR FROM HOBIE... -MITCH, I NEED AN AIRBORNE COMMAND POST, I NEED YOU UP THERE. I'LL BE HERE FOR HOBIE, IF ANYTHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO HOBIE, OKAY? -OKAY, I'M ON MY WAY! -HEY, MITCH, MIND IF I TAG ALONE? -YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO STAY OFF THE BEACH. -YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

YEAH, IT WORKS FOR ME. -WOMAN: NO. -YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT! [YELLING] -MAN: GET UNDER SOMETHING! -CORT: MORE GOOD NEWS. -BETTER THAN BUSTING MY TANK? -WE'RE TRAPPED. I FIGURE WE'VE GOT LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THERE BETWEEN US AND THEN WE START BREATHING THIS POISON GAS. -WELL, THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY OUT. -YEAH, THERE IS. IT MEANS LEAVING OUR EARTHLY BODIES BEHIND. WHAT'RE YOU DOING? -THAT LIGHT UP THERE IS COMING FROM SOMEWHERE. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHERE. -COME ON, CRAIG. -IT'S BETTER THAN JUST SITTING HERE AND GETTING STUPID. -YOU'RE ALRIGHT? BUDDY, I'M TELLING YOU, THE HOLE UP THERE IS THE SIZE OF YOUR HAND, TOPS. UNLESS YOU BROUGHT A JACKHAMMER TO WICK IT, IT'S GOING TO STAY THAT WAY. WE'RE STUCK. -AH, WHO KNOWS HOW BAD THE DAMAGE IS OUT THERE. I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE LOFT. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT GINA. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER. WHAT IF SHE IS HURT, WHAT IF SHE NEEDS ME? -THEN SHE'S ON HER OWN, JUST LIKE WE ARE. -I KNOW. THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. IF I CAN'T GO UP, I AM GOING DOWN.

LOOK, I AM GOING TO GO AND GET SOME HELP, ALRIGHT? -NO, NO, PLEASE, DON'T GO. -OKAY. -I MEAN... GIVING BIRTH HERE IS ONE THING AND DOING IT ALONG IS ANOTHER. -OKAY, OKAY. -THANKS. -I'LL STAY. -THANKS. DO YOU HAVE TO STARE LIKE THAT? YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS. -I AM MAKING YOU NERVOUS? LADY, IF YOU ONLY KNEW. -I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME. -I'M EDDIE. -VALERIE. AND, IF YOU'RE REALLY THAT WORRIED, WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE FOR A WHILE? -LIKE WHAT? -I DON'T KNOW. JUST ANYTHING TO KEEP OUR MINDS OFF MY PAIN. -OH... OKAY, UM... -DO YOU'VE SOMETHING INTERESTING TO TALK ABOUT? DO YOU HAVE A DOG? DID YOU EVER RESCUE ANYONE FAMOUS? HOW'S YOUR LOVE LIFE? OH, HERE WE GO, HOT TOPIC. WHAT'S SHE LIKE? IS SHE PRETTY? -YEAH. YEAH, SHE'S PRETTY. SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? -PROBLEM? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM? THERE'S NO PROBLEM. -YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. -THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. -OH, GOD. OH... -OKAY, OKAY, SO WE HAD A LITTLE FIGHT THIS MORNING. SHAUNI AND I... -SHAUNI? WHAT KIND OF NAME IS SHAUNI? [VALERIE MOANING] -SHAUNI: KMF-295, THIS IS UNIT 214. ALL CLEAR AT TOWER 10, STILL NO SIGN OF EDDIE. -THERE YOU GO. -CRAIG: THERE'S A TINY HOLE BETWEEN TWO ROCKS, I WAS ABLE TO SQUEEZE MY KNIFE THROUGH AND DROP IT TO THE OTHER SIDE. MAYBE SOMEBODY WOULD FIND IT AT THE BOTTOM. -YEAH, MAYBE A GIANT OCTOPUS WILL SWIM BY AND KNOCK THE ROCKS LOOSE WITH ONE SWING OF ITS MIGHTY TENTACLE, HUH! -THEN, WHAT'S YOUR BRILLIANT PLAN? -MY BRILLIANT PLAN IS TO FACE REALITY. THE GAME WE'RE PLAYING HERE ISN'T BREAK OUT, IT'S BEAT THE CLOCK. WE CAN'T DIG OUR WAY OUT OF HERE, SO WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL SOMEBODY FINDS US. IF WE'RE ALIVE WHEN THEY DO, WE WIN. OTHERWISE, WE LOSE. [HELICOPTER] -MITCH: JOHN, BRING US CLOSER! -THORPE: HOW'S THE HIGHWAY, MITCH? -DCH IS STILL BLOCKED BY THE LANDSLIDE. LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSED FOR A WHILE. PARAMEDICS SEEM TO HAVE THINGS UNDER CONTROL THOUGH. I'VE SPOTTED EDDIE'S UNIT, BURIED IN THE SAND, 50 YARDS SOUTH OF TOWER 18. NO SIGN OF EDDIE. -ALRIGHT, I WILL HAVE MCCLAIN CHECK IT OUT. ANYTHING ELSE? -MITCH: PIER FIRE IS RAGING OUT OF CONTROL, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS ALL OVER IT. -POINT FERMIN TOWER HAS COLLAPSED, BUT NO ONE'S BEEN HURT. OTHERWISE, THE BEACH IS EMPTY. I THINK WE'RE ALL CLEAR OUT HERE. -ANY WORD FROM HOBIE? -NOT YET, MITCH. I'M SORRY. -I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PASS OVER MY HOUSE ON THE WAY BACK. -GINA: CAPTAIN THORPE! -STAND BY, MITCH. -UM, I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO DO THAT, DAD. -HEY, HEY, HOBIE!
