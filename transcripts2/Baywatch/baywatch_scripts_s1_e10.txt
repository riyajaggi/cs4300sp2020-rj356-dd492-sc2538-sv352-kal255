 BAYWATCH "SHELTER ME" [THUNDER] [THUNDER] [NEWSCASTER] WHAT STARTED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVERAL DAYS AGO, OFF THE HAWAIIAN ISLAND, HAS FINALLY REACHED THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. THE STORM CAME ASHORE JUST NORTH OF SAN CLEMENTE, AND HAS BEACH COMMUNITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY PREPARING FOR WHAT COULD BE THE WORST WE'VE SEEN IN EIGHT YEARS. THESE PICTURES ARE A GRAPHIC REMINDER OF THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DAMAGE DONE WHEN THAT STORM CAUGHT THE SOUTHLAND OFF-GUARD. THIS TIME, AUTHORITIES ARE BUSY EVACUATING PEOPLE FROM HERMOSA BEACH ALL THE WAY NORTH TO MALIBU. HI. WHO WAS THAT ON THE PHONE? MY MOTHER. SHE HAS ANOTHER PROSPECTIVE CLIENT FOR ME TO MEET WHEN WE GO UP NEXT WEEK. ANYTHING INTERESTING? A FRIEND OF HERS WANTS ME TO DRAW UP A NEW WILL, SOMETHING ABOUT CUTTING OUT HIS WIFE. WHY'S HE WANT TO DO THAT? HE CLAIMS SHE'S TRYING TO KILL HIM BY COOKING WITH TOO MUCH SALT. THE WEATHER IS GONNA BE BAD. WE'RE REALLY GONNA GET IT. YOU KNOW, WE COULD GO SOMEPLACE ELSE, AND SEE YOUR PARENTS ANOTHER TIME. GINA. LET'S NOT HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN. MY MOTHER ALREADY KNOWS WE WENT TO NEW YORK LAST SPRING TO SEE YOUR FOLKS. SO? SHE KEEPS A LITTLE SCORECARD ON HER REFRIGERATOR. IF WE GO TO SEE YOUR PARENTS MORE THAN MY PARENTS, SHE'LL HIT ME WITH THAT FAVORITISM THING. AND I'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT.

[HANGS UP THE TELEPHONE] [LAUGHING] [THORPE] AND SLIGHTLY SMALLER WAVES UP FROM SANTA MONICA AND WILL ROGERS BEACH. BUT CHECKING ZUMA AND BROAD BEACH, SURF IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE FOUR TO SIX FOOT RANGE. SO WAX DOWN YOUR STICKS AND PACK UP YOUR WOODIES. THIS IS CAPTAIN DON THORPE... THIS IS CAPTAIN DON THORPE SPEAKING FOR THE KBLA'S... SURF REPORT. [CLEARS THROAT] OH... SORRY, SIR. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SNEAK UP ON YOU LIKE THAT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE STILL HERE. I WAS JUST ON MY WAY OUT. ALL RIGHT. HOW WAS IT? SUPER! GREAT. I MEAN... WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU DOING? I'M PRACTICING FOR AN AUDITION I HAVE TO TAKE AT KBLA. THEY CALLED DOWN HERE TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS INTERESTED IN TRYING OUT FOR A NEW RADIO SPOT THEY ARE DOING WITH THE DAILY SURF CONDITIONS. YOU'LL BE A HARD MAN TO BEAT. [LAUGHING] I FIGURE WITH MY QUALIFICATIONS, AND INCREDIBLE CHARISMA, I MIGHT HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SHOT. WHY NOT? WISH ME LUCK. LUCK. -HELLO, CRAIG. -HEY. WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE? WHERE YOU GOING? I'M GONNA TAKE A FINAL PATROL. MAKE SURE THE BEACHES ARE EMPTY. I'LL NAVIGATE. OKAY. [MOANING] [RADIO] ALL UNITS... YOU WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT?

CRAIG, IT'S NO BIG DEAL. IT'S JUST THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE A DEEP SEEDED, PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED TO ALWAYS BE IN CONTROL. YOU FUNCTION BETTER WHEN YOU HAVE EVERYTHING PLANNED OUT. HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING DONAHUE, OR SOMETHING? YOU ALWAYS TAKE SAUSAGE AND MUSHROOMS ON YOUR PIZZA, YOU ALWAYS LEAVE DODGER GAMES AFTER ONE OUT IN THE EIGHTH, YOU GET YOUR HAIR CUT EVERY THREE WEEKS, AND I BET YOU LAY YOUR CLOTHES OUT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED.

WHEN YOU GET MARRIED, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY SO OFTEN, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT. IT'S LIKE A REQUIREMENT. I CAN'T WAIT. THE DUMBEST THING S YOU FIND THE STUPIDEST THINGS TO ARGUE ABOUT, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY MAD AT THE OTHER PERSON. I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MAKING UP. WHERE YOU GOING?

ANYWAYS, DURING A STORM, YOU COULD HEAR THE WATERMELON BABY HOWLING. [THUNDER] HE HATED THUNDER. SO, FINALLY, DURING ONE STORM, IT GOT SO BAD. HIS MOTHER COULDN'T STAND LISTENING TO HIM ANYMORE, SO SHE RAN OUT INTO THE RAIN AND UNLOCKED THE CELLAR DOOR THEN WHAT? THEN AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS OF BEING FED NOTHING BUT WATERMELON, HE WAS WAITING FOR HER. HE KILLED HER? THEN HE RAN OUT INTO THE WOODS AND WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN. SUPPOSEDLY, DURING A BAD STORM, YOU CAN STILL HEAR HIM HOWLING OUT IN THE WOODS AT NIGHT. [WIND HOWLING] YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SCARE ME. IS IT WORKING? [THUNDER] YES. DON'T WORRY. IT'S ONLY THE POWER. THERE. SEE? THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. COULD-- COULD YOU... HOLD ME? JUST FOR A MINUTE. SURE. THE EMERGENCY GENERATOR WILL KEEP US LIT FOR A WHILE.
