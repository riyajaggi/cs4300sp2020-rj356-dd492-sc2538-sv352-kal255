 [SOFT ROCK PLAYING] -HEY, HEY, HEY, YOU'RE LATE. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO RELIEVE ME AN HOUR AGO. CORT: SORRY, MAN. LOLA NEEDED ME. I GOT A MEETING WAITING FOR ME BACK AT THE LOFT. I'VE GOT TO BE AT COURT AT THREE. I'VE GOT A BUSINESS LUNCH IN BETWEEN. I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO GO BACK TO HEADQUARTERS TO CHANGE. AND YOU'RE SORRY? LOOK, I'M HOLDING DOWN TWO JOBS AND A MARRIAGE. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T MAINTAIN A STRICT SCHEDULE? CHAOS. WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHAOS? SPENT THE BEST TIMES OF MY LIFE THERE. -WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW TO SAVE A PERSON WHO'S DROWNING. NOW, SAVING A LIFE DOES NOT END WHEN YOU PULL A PERSON OUT OF THE WATER. WHAT YOU DO ON THE SAND IS JUST AS IMPORTANT. TODAY WE'RE GONNA PRACTICE WHAT WE LEARNED IN CPR. SO I'M GONNA NEED A VOLUNTEER. ANYBODY? HOBIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU? COME ON. LIE DOWN. NOW I'M GONNA GO OVER THE STEPS ONE BY ONE. FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE GONNA TILT HIS HEAD BACK. YOU'RE GONNA OPEN THE AIRWAY. AND THEN CHECK FOR BREATHING. OKAY, NOW YOU'RE GONNA PINCH HIS NOSE SHUT, YOU'RE GONNA LEAN FORWARD, AND YOU'RE GONNA BLOW AIR INTO HIS MOUTH. GOT IT? NOW LET ME SHOW YOU AGAIN. -ALL RIGHT, I'M OUT OF HERE. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. NOT UNLESS YOU'RE IN MEXICO. I'M GIVING EDDIE A SURFING LESSON. -WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME HERE. COME ON. -WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? HEY, GUYS, I GOT SOMETHING ON MY FISHER LINE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. -LET'S CHECK IT OUT. -WELL, HOT DAMN. THAT'S A GENUINE ANTIQUE. BACK IN WORLD WAR II, THE NAVY USED STRING THESE BABIES ALL ALONG THE COAST. THAT'S A CLASSIC. -THAT'S A BOMB. -WHAT, THIS LITTLE FIRECRACKER? NO, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. AS LONG AS THAT SPIKE'S STICKING UP, NOTHING CAN SET HER OFF. I'LL JUST GO DEFUSE IT. -YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. -[SCREAMS] AH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. -OF COURSE I'M RIGHT. THIS IS A JOB FOR TRAINED PROFESSIONALS, NOT A COUPLE LIFEGUARDS. I'LL CALL THE BOMB SQUAD. THEY'LL COME OUT AND CORDON OFF THE BEACH. [SCREAMING] -GO ON, CALL FOR BACKUP. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -ARE YOU OKAY? -WHAT A KISS. -IT WAS JUST MOUTH-TO-MOUTH. -IN YOUR DREAMS. -[LAUGHS] -CRAIG, JOHN. -AND YOU WANTED THE BOMB SQUAD TO HAVE ALL THE FUN. -ARE YOU OKAY? OH, MAN. I NEED A VACATION. -GREAT, WE LEAVE HEADQUARTERS AT SIX. [FRANTIC MUSIC] -REMEMBER TO FILE THE INCIDENT REPORTS NO LATER THAN FIVE O'CLOCK. -RIGHT. -I'M COUNTING ON YOU, MITCH, TO KEEP THINGS RUNNING SMOOTHLY WHILE I'M GONE. -I THOUGHT YOU WERE DRIVING YOUR SON TO THE AIRPORT, NOT ALL THE WAY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON. -SORRY, IT'S JUST THAT WITH MY YOUNGEST FINALLY LEAVING THE NEST, I FEEL LIKE I'M EMBARKING ON A WHOLE NEW LIFE. THIS IS THE FIRST LEG OF IT COULD BE A VERY, VERY EXCITING JOURNEY. -DRIVE SAFELY. -YEAH. OH. -DON'T FORGET MY SOMBRERO. IT IS GONNA LOOK SO GREAT ON THE WALL. -FINE. -AND A PONCHO WOULD BE NICE. AND IF YOU FIND ANY TURQUOISE EARRINGS, WOULD YOU BUY THOSE? -SHAUNI, I'M GOING TO A BEACH, NOT A SHOPPING MALL. -SO, YOU READY? -YEAH, YOU BET. -OKAY, HERE'S MY SHOPPING LIST. BE SURE AND HAGGLE. -OKAY, FINE. -SEE YOU MONDAY. UH-HUH. NICE LIPSTICK. HEY, JOHN, EDDIE. COME ON, LET'S HIT THE ROAD. I GOT ALL YOUR STUFF. -[LAUGHS] OH, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN THIS THING WITHOUT A TARP OVER IT. -LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE SIX FEET OF DIRT AND A HEADSTONE OVER IT. -THESE THINGS WERE BUILT TO RUN FOREVER. -ESPECIALLY IF YOU SPEND EVERY WEEKEND WORKING ON IT. -IT WAS MY FIRST CAR. IT'S A LABOR OF LOVE. COME ON, LET'S GO. -WHERE? -VACATION. MEXICO. SURFING. I TOLD YOU I NEEDED A VACATION. THAT WAS AN INVITATION THIS MORNING, WASN'T IT? -WHAT ABOUT YOUR SCHEDULE? -I PUSHED MY COURT DATE BACK A WEEK. -WELL, LET'S GO. -ALL RIGHT. OKAY, GUYS, PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE. [CHEERING] ISN'T THIS GREAT? A NICE, QUIET NIGHT, A ROARING FIREPLACE, A FRIENDLY GAME OF CHECKERS BETWEEN FATHER AND SON.

LOOK HOW THEY'RE BULGING. SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW TO PACK A SUITCASE. I MUST HAVE SHOWED HER A HUNDRED TIMES HOW TO DO IT RIGHT. -WANT SOME COFFEE? SOMETHING TO EAT? YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID? NOW THAT TED'S FINALLY GONE, OUR "SHAM OF A MARRIAGE" IS OVER. IN 27 YEARS, I NEVER HEARD HER USE THE WORD "SHAM". I PICKED UP SOME NEW VOCABULARY, TOO, WHEN GAYLE LEFT ME. -YOU LIGHT? -DARK. -LOOKS LIKE I GOT HERE JUST IN TIME, MITCH. YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT CHECKERS. AND I'M JUST THE MAN TO TEACH YOU. [MEXICAN SONG PLAYING] -I TOLD YOU WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE THE HIGHWAY. NOW WE'RE LOST. -THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO. WE TURN AROUND AND WE GO BACK AND WE PICK UP THE HIGHWAY. -NO. -WE'RE NOT LOST, MAN. -ARE WE? -NO. WELL, THEN SHOW ME WHERE WE ARE ON THE MAP. -[SIGHS] [GRUNTS] SOME PLACES YOU HAVE TO FIND WITHOUT A MAP. -[SIGHS] HOW WOULD THAT SERVE YOU? -I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU GUYS EVER HAVE AN EXPERIENCE AS INTENSE AS THE ONE I HAD WITH INES, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR WAY BACK, TOO. -INES WHO?

I'D BRING YOU FLOWERS, I'D TAKE YOUR LUNCH AT THE TOWER, AND I'D EVEN CARRY YOUR LIFEGUARD STUFF FOR YOU. -BUT, HOBIE. YOU ALREADY DO ALL THAT. -I KNOW. -HOBIE. -I THOUGHT I-- -WHAT? HOBIE. [SIRENS WAILING ON TV] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [TV TURNS OFF] -YEAH? THORPE: IT'S ME. -IT'S YOU? WELL, THAT WAS QUICK. I BET YOU HAD A STOPWATCH DURING YOUR WEDDING CEREMONY. -I COULDN'T DO IT, MITCH. I GOT UP TO THE COUNTER AND HANDED ACROSS THE DIVORCE PAPERS, BUT WHEN THE CLERK REACHED FOR THEM, I PULLED THEM BACK. -WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? -WHEN I HELD OUT THE PAPERS, I SAW THAT GOLD BAND. ALL THE RATIONALIZATIONS IN THE WORLD COULDN'T CHANGE THE WAY I SUDDENLY FELT. -THESE FEELING HAVE BEEN ALWAYS THERE, YOU'VE JUST BEEN MOVING TOO FAST TO SEE THEM. -OH, THE LAST FEW DAYS... THE CLUB, THE CAR HAVE BEEN GREAT. BUT NOT AS GREAT AS IT WOULD'VE BEEN IF I COULD'VE... SHARE IT WITH DORIS. I'D FORGOTTEN HOW TO JUST... LIVE FOR MYSELF. FOR SO LONG, ALL MY THOUGHTS, MY DREAMS HAVE... ALWAYS INCLUDED HER. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO. -YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW THAT CHANGES. I MEAN, IF ENDING THIS IS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT. -OH, I THINK NOW... OUR MARRIAGE WAS PRETTY FLAT THE LAST FEW YEARS. BORING, I GUESS. MAYBE THAT MAKES IT A SHAM, I DON'T KNOW. BUT I HONESTLY THOUGHT THIS IS. THE RIGHT THING TO DO. -MAYBE IT IS. BUT THERE'S NO HURRY. -YEAH. YEAH. THE OTHER NIGHT, AFTER SHE SLAMMED THE FRONT DOOR ON ME, I JUST... STOOD THERE, HOLDING MY SUITCASES. BEFORE I KNEW IT, I WAS HERE. I HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. -YOU CAN STAY HERE AS LONG AS IT TAKES. BUT GO TALK TO HER. -YEAH. SHAUNI: HOBIE. HOBIE! WAIT! HI. I WANNA TALK TO YOU. -YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO KILL ME. -WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT? -FOR WHAT I DID. -I THINK WHAT YOU DID WAS SWEET. -"SWEET"? THAT RANKS RIGHT UP THERE WITH "CUTE." YOU MEAN SHOVE OFF. -WAIT. I'M GLAD YOU KISSED ME. -YOU ARE? -YEAH. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE GO THROUGH THEIR WHOLE LIVES NEVER HAVING ANYONE EVER FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM. BUT I HAVE TWO PEOPLE. I THINK THAT'S PRETTY SPECIAL. -YEAH, I GUESS IT IS. BUT YOU CAN'T DATE BOTH OF US. -I KNOW. -AND YOU WERE DATING EDDIE FIRST. -TRUE. -IT WOULD PROBABLY HURT HIM IF YOU DUMPED HIM FOR A 13- YEAR-OLD. -YEAH. -SO MAYBE WE COULD JUST BE FRIENDS FOR A WHILE. -THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. -FRIENDS? -GOOD FRIENDS. [MEXICAN MUSIC PLAYING] -FIRST YOU WRECK THE FURNITURE, NOW THE WIRING. WHY DON'T JUST BURN THE PLACE DOWN AND GET IT OVER WITH? -WE'LL MAKE IT GOOD AS NEW AS SOON AS WE FINISH WITH RIGLER. [THUD] -A SMALL SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THAT VULTURE. -YEAH, IT'S A BIGGER SACRIFICE THAN ANYONE ELSE AROUND HERE HAS EVER MADE. -DON'T JUDGE THEM TOO HARSHLY. THEY'RE AFRAID FOR THEIR FAMILIES. LOOK, RIGLER IS A COYOTE. HE HAS TAKEN MANY OF OUR PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER. AND IF WE DON'T DO WHAT HE WANTS, HE CAN TELL THE AMERICAN AUTHORITIES WHERE THEY ARE. -AS IF HE REALLY KNEW. -AND YOU WOULD TAKE THE CHANCE? OF COURSE YOU WOULD. AND SO DID OUR SHERIFF. HE TRIED TO STOP RIGLER. THEY TIED HIM TO THE BACK OF A TRUCK. THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THESE STREETS UNTIL HE WAS DEAD. SO YOU SEE, THEY HAVE PLENTY OF REASONS TO BE AFRAID. -WELL, SO DOES RIGLER. HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET. HEY, BOYS. -READY? -ALMOST. CRAIG: LET'S DO IT. [MEXICAN MUSIC PLAYING] -HE'S GONE, HE'S GONE. -OKAY. -THIS BETTER BE GOOD. -IT'S GONNA BE GREAT. TRUST ME. NEVER.
