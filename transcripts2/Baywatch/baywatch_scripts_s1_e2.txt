 Baywatch (1989–2001): Season 1, Episode 2 - Heat Wave - full transcript 
 During the hottest day of the summer, Mitch's old friend, Steve, and his young son, Mike, show up for a surprise visit. But when Mike is trapped with a local boy in a storm drain and is in danger of drowning, Steve is forced to admit to Mitch that he kidnapped his son because he is in a custody battle with his ex-wife. Meanwhile, Craig is forced to decide by his demanding law firm boss between being a lifeguard, or staying at the law firm. But Gina suggests to him a third option: open up his own law firm.
