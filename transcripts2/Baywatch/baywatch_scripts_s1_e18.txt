 Baywatch (1989–2001): Season 1, Episode 18 - Shark Derby - full transcript 
 After a couple of sharks are seen in the bay and just off of the beach, Mitch becomes even more concerned when the greedy owner of a restaurant sponsors a Shark Derby to help promote the restaurant with a prize of $25,000 to the one who kills the biggest shark. Lives are put at risk, especially for one Baywatch lifeguard who is attacked while saving some children, and Mitch becomes determined to find out why so many sharks are in the area and what connection Bucky, the restaurant owner, has with the unusually large number of sharks populating the bay.

WHAT MAKES THEM THINK THAT THEY CAN WEAR JEANS TO ABSOLUTELY EVERY OCCASION? WHAT KIND OF A GUY ENTERS A SHARK DERBY ANYWAY?

HERE TODAY, COULD BE GONE TOMORROW. -IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU. -BUT IT COULD. IT COULD, AND THAT'S WHY I WANT THIS SHARK DERBY TO BE THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST SHOW EVER. I WANT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT FOR MONTHS. I WANT TOURISTS COMING IN TO SEE THOSE DEAD SHARKS HUNG UP. -SO WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO? GENTLEMEN, I WANT YOU TO HELP ME MAKE THIS THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST SHARK DERBY THIS TOWN IS EVER GONNA SEE. [LAUGHS] -SURE, JUST TELL US HOW. "SURE, JUST TELL US HOW." SHUT UP, CHUM. [EERIE MUSIC] -GOOD MORNING. -MORNING. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY. -YEAH. [SIGHS] YOU EVER TRIED THIS STUFF? -WHAT? -IT'S BAHAMIAN LOVE LOTION? -NO. -YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT'S IN HERE. -WHAT'S IN THERE? -IT'S GOT TROPICAL OILS, FRUIT JUICES, AND OAT BRAN. -THEY FINALLY CAME UP WITH A SUNBLOCK THAT LOWERS YOUR CHOLESTEROL? -EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS, I GUESS. BESIDES IT'S THE LATEST THING. -YEAH. -WHAT'S THE MATTER? [EERIE MUSIC] CALL IN. -HEY, SHARK! THERE'S A SHARK OUT THERE. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -GO! -COME ON, MAN! -GET OUT OF THE WATER. GET OUT. STAY ON YOUR BOARD. GET OUT OF THE WATER! YOU'RE SAFE. OKAY, GET ON. -WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU ENTERED THE WATER TO REACH THAT SURFER? -I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT GETTING THAT GUY OUT OF THE WATER. THAT, AND THE THEME FROM "JAWS". -WEREN'T YOU SCARED? YEAH, SURE I WAS SCARED. WOULDN'T YOU BE? -YOU HAVE GOT QUITE A STORY ON YOUR HANDS. NOTHING COMPARED TO THE WAY THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT SOUND. -SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SHAUNI, ASKING HER WHY THE BEACHES WEREN'T CLOSED. -MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE. -I HAVE HEARD THAT SEVERAL OTHER SHARKS HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE AREA. AS FAR AS I KNOW-- -ONE OTHER. THIS AFTERNOON AT SUNSET BEACH. -WAS ANYBODY HURT? -NO, NOBODY WAS HURT. -EXCUSE ME. -YEAH. -WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. EVERY YEAR AT THIS TIME, THE SHARK POPULATION INCREASES BECAUSE THEY ARE GIVING BIRTH IN THE BAY. -DOESN'T THAT MEAN YOU HAVE A SHARK PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS? -NO, WHAT IT MEANS IS THIS YEAR IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER YEAR. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A SHARK ATTACK IN THE AREA. -WHAT ABOUT THE SHARK DERBY THAT'S BEING SPONSORED NOW BY A LOCAL RESTAURANT? WILL THAT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY? -ANY TIME YOU GOT A BUNCH OF FISHERMEN CHUMMING UP AND DOWN THE COAST TRYING TO INCITE A FEEDING FRENZY, YES, I WOULD SAY IT'S MORE DANGEROUS TO GO INTO THE WATER. -THEN YOU ARE OPPOSED TO THE SHARK DERBY? -I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE. -ALL RIGHT, BOYS, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO GO DIVING. OUT BACK YOU'LL FIND A 55-GALLON DRUM FULL OF FISH GUTS. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS GIZMO, ATTACH IT TO THAT DRUM, OKAY? THEN I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT ABOUT 200 YARDS OFF SHORE AND SINK IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS RESTAURANT. MAKE SURE YOU WEIGHT IT DOWN. -YOU GOT IT, BUCKY. -I'D LIKE YOU TO DO THAT LATER TONIGHT, SAY 11-12 O'CLOCK. -WELL, IT'S KIND OF TOUGH TO DIVE AT NIGHT. -HOW TOUGH? -BUT WE CAN DO IT, RIGHT, ROY? -RIGHT, ROY? -SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE SOME OF YOUR LIFEGUARDS CRIED SHARK, I AM SUPPOSED TO CANCEL MY DERBY. -NO, IT'S NOT WHAT I AM SAYING. -YOU WERE ABOUT TO. YOU'RE GETTING THAT RIGHTEOUS LIFEGUARD LOOK ON YOUR FACE AGAIN, MITCH. TONY, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ME ANOTHER BOTTLE OF THAT '74 CABERNET. -WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT OUR PERSONAL FEELINGS ASIDE HERE AND CONCENTRATE ON THE PROBLEM. -WHAT PROBLEM? A SHARK WAS SIGHTED. I AM HAVING A SHARK DERBY. PROBLEM SOLVED. -I'M SUGGESTING YOU POSTPONE THE DERBY UNTIL I HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IF THERE'S AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF SHARKS OUT THERE. THAT'S ALL. -SUGGESTION REJECTED. TONY, SERVE IT TO TABLE 18. LET HIM KNOW THAT BUCKY ALLEN PERSONALLY RECOMMENDED IT. THAT'S A VERY NICE FINISH. YOU WERE SAYING? -YOU KNOW THAT A DERBY WILL ATTRACT SHARKS BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE CHUMMING. -MITCH, ALL I KNOW IS THAT THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING IN THE WORLD YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME FROM HAVING THIS SHARK DERBY. WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME? [TENSE MUSIC] [ULTRASOUND STARTS WORKING] -I AM STUFFED. -YOU GUYS STAY PUT. I'LL CLEAR TONIGHT. -YOU CLEARED LAST NIGHT. -TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW WON'T KILL ME. -WANT SOME COFFEE? MITCH: YEAH, I'D LOVE SOME. -TAKEN CARE OF. -EXCUSE ME, WHAT IS IT YOU ARE ABOUT TO HIT ME UP FOR? -I HAVE SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU RESPONSIBLY. NOW WHATEVER YOUR ANSWER IS, I'LL ACCEPT IT JUST AS LONG AS YOU'RE FAIR WITH ME. RESPONSIBILITY, FAIRNESS, NO PROBLEM. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? -I'D LIKE TO ENTER THE SHARK DERBY. -NOT A CHANCE. SOME SUGAR? -GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY. -I'LL GIVE YOU A BUNCH OF GOOD REASONS, THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE ONE. A, YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH. B, YOU DON'T HAVE THE REGISTRATION FEE. C, YOU DON'T HAVE A BOAT. AND D, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. AND E, I AM DEAD AGAINST THIS TOURNAMENT. THE END. -WELL, DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD AT LEAST LISTEN TO HIM? -OH. OKAY. -I AM OLD ENOUGH, AT LEAST I WAS THE OTHER DAY WHEN I HOOKED THAT SHARK WITH YOU. BESIDES, SOMEONE OFFERED TO TAKE ME. PAID THE BOAT REGISTRATION FEE, AND WILL MAKE SURE IT'S NOT DANGEROUS. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] HOBIE, ANYBODY HOME? HEY, HOBIE, HOW IS IT GOING? HEY, AMANDA. -HELLO. SO DID YOU TALK THE OLD MAN INTO IT? -NO, HE HAS NOT TALKED THE OLD MAN INTO IT. -DAD. -OH, COME ON NOW, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT LETTING THE BOY GO FISHING, HUH? I MEAN, LOOK, I NEED A GOOD FIRST MATE, AND HE'LL BE LEARNING FROM THE VERY BEST. -CAPTAIN, I JUST GOT THROUGH REAMING BUCKY ALLEN ABOUT THE TOURNAMENT. HOW CAN I LET HOBIE GO NOW? -BECAUSE YOU CAN LET ME MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS. -HE'S GOT A POINT. -I MEAN HE'S A TEENAGER. -WHAT IS THIS? I AM SURROUNDED HERE. ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN GO, BUT YOU BE CAREFUL. THANKS. SMILE, OLD MAN, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. YOU KNOW, HOB, I REMEMBER ONE TIME DOWN OFF COSTA RICA, TRACKING THE BIGGEST HAMMERHEAD I EVER SAW.
