 Baywatch (1989–2001): Season 1, Episode 8 - Cruise Ship - full transcript 
 Eddie becomes suspicious of Andrew, Shauni's new boyfriend, over his sudden change in attitudes. But Shauni ignores Eddie's suspicious thinking he's just jealous, until Andrews shows his true colors when he gets increasingly demanding and physically violent with her. Meanwhile, a charted boat catering to drunken revels looks like trouble to Craig, who proves correct when he and Mitch must make a daring rescue after the boat heads out of control and straight for the crowded Santa Monica pier.
