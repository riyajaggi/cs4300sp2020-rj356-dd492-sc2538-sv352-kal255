 Wiene Dragon's Daughter A monster... crying? Where'd it go? That vouivre! It can't be far! Find it! Hey, you. Have you seen a vouivre around here? M-More urgently, do you have a potion? I've got someone who's been badly burned... How's that my problem? Bell-dono! Everyone... We've been looking for you. When we got separated, we worried about what might happen, but... I'm glad you're all right. Acting solo here on the Nineteenth Floor is dangerous.

 Um... Bell-sama... Who is that person? For now... let's go back to the Eighteenth Floor. And now, Bell-sama... Who is this person, and where is she from? Did you go and bring in trouble again by saving some unknown woman? Explain this, Bell! Wait, everyone! She's... Please, step aside, Bell-sama! What on earth are you thinking? Did you bring her along because she's got a pretty face? That would just make you some kind of monster fetishist! I-It's not like... Bell-sama, monsters are monsters! They are the enemies of humanity! Bell! Get away from there! Bell-dono! Bell-sama! Be... ll... Bell... Y-Yes. That's my name. Bell... You... Your name is Bell. That monster... spoke. You've gotta be kidding me. Bell-sama, what happened between you and her? I found her on the Nineteenth Floor. She was being hunted by adventurers and attacked by monsters. She was trembling and crying! I want to help her. We cannot do that, Bell-sama! If people find out we're sheltering a monster, the Hestia Familia is done for! Even so... I don't want to abandon her! Oh, just do whatever you want. I'm sorry, everyone. Thank you. What do we do next? Are we going to take her with us to the surface? Yes. In the Dungeon, she'd only be attacked again. Once we get back home, I want to ask the Goddess's opinion, too. Home? Yes. Come to our house with us. This isn't good, Ouranos. A monster endowed with intelligence has made contact with an adventurer, and will soon leave Babel. And who is this adventurer, Fels? Bell Cranel. The Little Rookie. Hermes' favorite, is it? What will you do? For better or worse, the Hestia Familia has gained too much attention in town. I would like to determine whether Hestia's family can become their hope, or not. What did you say? I-I've never heard of a talking monster! I-I thought that might be the case. To be honest, I don't know how I should take this. But when she's this scared, well... Then you mean... Yes. We'll look after her here for a while. Say, you there. Do you have a name? Name? Bell. Oh, no. That's my name. What's yours? My own... name? I thought she might not have one. The name of her species is "vouivre," but... That isn't her individual name. Bell, you decide. What? That's right, Bell-kun. You're the one who brought her here. You must take responsibility and be the one who names her! I-In that case... Um... Maybe... V-Vergine? Bell-sama, that's the name of a divine spirit in those heroic tales. Yes! Do you think it's no good? Well, for Bell-sama, it's pretty good... But it's kinda long. And too fancy. It is pretentious. In that case! How about we shorten it to Wiene-kun? To... Wiene? Wie... ne? My... name? Wiene! I'm Wiene! But there's no mistaking that she is a monster. We need to gather information. Let's split up and ask around. Are there other individuals like her? What is happening in the Dungeon right now? That's what we want to know. Outside of the deities Hephaistios, Miach, and Take and their familias, be careful not to appear to be digging too deeply. It doesn't matter what it is, find some kind of lead. That's what happened. Can you think of anything? It is difficult to believe, but the possibilities in the Lower World... Sometimes they go beyond what even gods can predict, into the unknown. Mikoto... How do you feel about this? About this monster? I don't know. I don't sense any hostility. She truly seems just like any ordinary girl, but... I can't stop feeling anxious. She is a monster... I fear her. Hey, did you hear? The story about a monster who stole some armor. The armed monster, right? I heard it's starting to appear in the Middle Floors now, too. Yeah. They say those guys from Livira had a rough time with it. Oh. Is that it? It can't be... Right? What is that? That's the sun. It is called "the sun." The sun... It's warm! Above ground is pretty, isn't it? This is too warm and cozy! I want to take it off! You can't do that, Wiene-sama! J-Just bear with it, Wiene! All right? Alb Spring Water. Do you have any information on monsters that speak? Don't know a thing. Then is there someone who might know? I know something. Info on monsters that talk. It's just a scrap though. Madl? Huh? You know my alias? Master, honey beer! So? What information do you have? I got cleaned out gambling recently, so... I'm not even sure I'll be able to pay for this, you know? In the Dungeon, sometimes, even when there aren't other adventurers around, people hear voices talking. The story's been making the rounds for a while. Sometimes they hear multiple voices talking... Some think they hear singing. There's been rumors of that, too. What else... There's someone who wants information on talking monsters, like you do. While no one else is taking the rumors seriously, it seems these people just won't let it go. And that group's identity? I'd love to know that, too. I've been tasked with that, you see. I haven't seen you before, have I? Who are you affiliated with? You're pretty desperate for an elf. Huh? You're leaving already? I wanted to talk a little more! I'm being followed. My opponent is a high-level adventurer. I can't afford to be choosy about my methods. Wiene-sama? Would you like to have your meal now? You haven't eaten anything since yesterday, have you? Meal? Um... She's talking about food. I'll eat with you, so... Let's eat. Okay! Try some. Is it good? It's... good? Truly? That is an "onigiri," which Mikoto-sama made for you. Please, have some of these fruits, as well! Hey, Bell? Hm? The fruit had a really good smell! Yes, it did. They were juicy and sweet. The onigiri was good, too. Bell, was it good to you, too? Yes. It was very good. Bell. Bell! Bell-sama! I'll get the medicine kit! No... Bell... Does it hurt? I... No! I'm sorry... I'm sorry, Bell! It's all right. Everything is all right. Good. Bell! Bell... Bell! Stop that. Bell... I'm home... How did it go for all of you? No good. There weren't any decent leads. Takemikazuchi-sama said he couldn't think of anything, either. Lili went through quite a bit, too... Bell-kun? Go ahead, Wiene-sama. W-Welcome home. She seems to have taken quite a liking to you. Haruhime-kun! You have the makings of a mother! It's good! Mikoto, you're amazing! Th-Thank you very much. Haruhime told me. She said Mikoto's food is really good! Not at all! I still lack in discipline. To think I'd be complimented in such a straightforward manner... Mikoto-sama! It's a monster that's complimenting you. Don't lower your guard over something like this! You're much too rigid, Miss Supporter. At times like these, it's how you respond to it that's important. It's more that you're much too relaxed, Goddess. Now, let's not worry about it! Here, Wiene-kun! Eat mine, too! It's good! It is, isn't it? Here you are. Still, she sure has started talking a lot. Yeah. As we were playing this afternoon, she started talking more and more. It's just... I'm not Li'l Lili, but... Are you sure you're all right with things like this? Welf, are you wary of her, too? The truth is, I feel like everything I thought has been undermined. Come on, Miss Supporter! You, too! Lili is fine as she is, thank you. Don't say that. I'm fine, thank you. I guess for you, it's more of a weight off your mind. Or are you feeling lonely now that they've taken her? Nothing like that. Why isn't Bell with us? That's because... Bell-sama is male. Of course he's not here. There's a lot that goes on between males and females, Wiene-kun. This is paradise. How do you like the bath, Wiene-kun? It feels good! Is something wrong, Lili-sama? There are too many people with well-built bodies in this familia. Honestly... I'd rather be with Bell after all! W-Wait! Wiene-kun! No! You mustn't! Huh? Wiene? Wait! Huh? All right. Done. Thank you, Welf! No problem. Bell... It doesn't hurt? No. It doesn't hurt. Bell! Bell! Why are you so happy, Bell-sama? Her nails will eventually grow back. If they aren't filed down, they may cause even greater injury. Th-That's true, but... Lili, do you hate Bell? What's this all of a sudden? You hate him? Well, that's... That's not... I... I love Bell-sama! Yeah. I love him, too. And, of course, I do, too! As do I! Oh, honestly! So does Lili! I love Bell-sama! Me, too. I love everyone, too. Everyone... Bell... and everyone... love each other, right? It's so warm! It may simply be pity, but I feel the same way Bell-sama does. That girl... Wiene-sama... I don't want to abandon her. For me... I have no clear answer. However, Wiene-dono's smile... It does not look different to me than any of ours. If it is possible... If we could continue to cultivate our bonds this way... The gods... I think they must know something about the Dungeon. They know and hide things from the people of this world. They probably do. And even for those gods, this is an unforeseen situation. There is no doubt that we are caught up in an incredibly troublesome problem. You helped bring her here, too, didn't you? You want to rehash all of it again now? I never agreed with it. I just gave up fighting it. Because Bell-sama is the most softhearted person ever. We can't let ourselves be swayed by emotion. If anyone allows themselves to trust that girl... I know it will mean trouble for someone. It isn't possible for things to stay this way. Because that girl is a monster. Goddess, wouldn't it be better for you to sleep in your own room? Isn't it cramped here? It's great, isn't it? There are no boundaries between family, right? It's nice and warm! Wiene, where did you come from? Didn't anyone come with you? I don't know. Before I knew it, I was in a dark place, all alone. I have a dream, about Bell and everyone. A dream about... attacking people. I claw at people I don't know... Bite them... Tear them to pieces... Lots and lots of things turn red. It's a scary dream. The me in the dream is really angry, but little by little, it gets cold. Lots of people, just like you, Bell, protect people... from me. My body grows cold. My chest is empty, as though there was a hole in it. I see those people so clearly... After that, it's always the same. I turn red, then dark. Even if I cry and ask for someone to save me, no one does. It's a really scary, lonely dream. So, you've all figured out the destination of the smuggled monsters, I take it? Yes. In the basement of a mansion belonging to a noble Elurian family, we found them chained up. Lulune... About the talking monsters. You said there's a child sniffing around, didn't you? Yeah. An elven kid I've never seen before. I tried to follow, but a scent-bag took out my nose. I'm sorry. The word of the client is absolute. All we can do is collect information. Honestly... You've really shoved a heap of trouble onto us, Ouranos. The Ikelos Familia, is it? Next Time Monster One Wing Next time, "Monster."
