 A night of murder and betrayal, as blood is spilt in London and in Tokyo. Memories of a battle fought over a young man's soul and of new beginnings cut short before their time. Corruption and deceit. Crime and punishment. Right and wrong. The thunder of guns and the roaring sound of their own futures approaching. # Whenever I'm down # I call on you, my friend... #

EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMING Someone better not be trying to blow up Soho. Fuck this. Come on. Excuse me! Thank you. SIRENS WAIL Oh, fuck. I'm high as shit. I shouldn't have done that bump before we left. That was folly. Utter foolishness. And the second one. Ridiculous. GROANING Oh, my God. Taki. Taki! Taki! Is it a terrorist? I think he's Japanese. That does not mean he's not in Isis. I know him. Taki! He's my uncle. CROWD CLAMOUR DISTANT SIRENS VICKERS: Hey, Kenzo! Kenzo! Hey, you made it! I thought I'd lost you in there. Oh, yeah, she's on our side now. I think. You're injured. I'm fine. Oh, yeah, she's fine. Hey, we're about to get a SWAT team rammed up our ass but she's fine.

You're in a fucking Uber. TV NEWS PLAYS SOFTLY DISTANT SIRENS WAIL VOLUME INCREASES ..in the centre of Soho. Police struggled for control as crowds of terrified people ran for cover. Many desperately reaching out for missing friends or loved ones. BANGING ON DOOR Armed police were on the scene in minutes and the busy bars and restaurants... HE VOMITS GUNSHOT SOUND DISTORTS HE SOBS DISTANT SIRENS WAIL PHONE VIBRATES INDISTINCT CHATTER DOCTOR SPEAKS JAPANESE IN JAPANESE: DOOR OPENS IN JAPANESE: Did anyone see you bring him back here? Just the driver. It looks like a bullet's grazed his shoulder. But his chest... It's shrapnel. There was an explosion. An explosion? I think there was a hand grenade. Of course there was. We need to get this out of him. OK, hold on. IN JAPANESE: Yeah, OK, no. PHONE VIBRATES PHONE VIBRATES Tell her I'll call back. Kenzo will call you back. DONNA: Wait! Wait. Is Yuto still alive? Yes. Do you know what you're doing? No. YUTO SCREAMS SCREAMING CONTINUES SIREN WAILS IN JAPANESE: HE BREATHES UNSTEADILY PANTING IN JAPANESE: I'm sorry you got caught up in this, Sarah. I'm sorry. What happened tonight? You don't have to be strong. Not right now. Not with me, here. You can be not OK. You can be that. PHONE DIALS VICKERS: What were you doing there tonight? Huh? You brought death down upon everyone in that restaurant. So, what were you doing there? Got my wires crossed. Oops. SARCASTIC CHUCKLE Ah, fuck! I'm going to have to go to my father with this. Your father? Yeah, you ever...you ever see The Sopranos? Mm. He's the guy who watches that and complains they got the sound effects all wrong when someone gets beaten to death. Nice guy, huh? Oh, yeah, he's a fucking riot. Which is exactly what we're going to have when he gets here. The fucking Pittsburgh mafia running around. HE LAUGHS Not easy being a mobster's son, huh? Plus, you're no good at it. You don't know anything about me. I know you're standing in petrol, talking about lighting a match. Maybe don't do that. Especially not when I'm standing next to you. No, we're...we're all standing in it now. You, me, Abbot... Yuto. Especially Yuto. Huh, if he's still breathing. WRY CHUCKLE So don't make the call. We can all walk away from this. Just like that? Right. Thank God my wife is out tonight. She's watching Les Mis. And do you know how expensive those tickets are? She's seen it, like, ten fucking times already. HE SIGHS You know, you said on the phone, "If you want to take him, "you might not get a better chance than now." But he had 15, 20 guys with him. Including you. Am I right? About...about 20 guys. Cos I'm...I'm...I'm thinking back over what happened and I can't honestly say it felt like a great time. Y'know? Not when he was surrounded by 20 fucking men. And, like I said, one of 'em was you. And...and...and they seemed to be expecting us. So... ..maybe your helpful little tip wasn't really a helpful little tip at all. Huh. And these are the sort of questions my father's going to ask. LIGHTER CLICKS Fuck! Where's Kenzo? You got something I can use for my leg? There's a bathroom down the hall. He's going to be so fucking pissed. Fuck. PHONE RINGS IN JAPANESE: PHONE RINGS Ah, come on, come on, come on. Come on. SARAH: Kenzo will call you back. Wait! Wait. Is Yuto still alive? Yes. How about another drink? You want another drink? Yeah. All right. I sure could use one. Oh, my God. He used to keep a bottle of Johnnie Walker 21 in the garage, my old man. He'd go out there at Christmas, when the family got too much. He'd pour it into a paper cup and just... ..just drink it by himself. You imagine that? 200 bottle of scotch in a paper cup. He invited me out one year. And we...just drank Johnnie Walker 21 in the freezing cold... ..next to his car. And you're not saying anything we're just, like, we're just drinking. I remember I could see his breath in the air. HE SCOFFS And I was so fucking...grateful. MOURNFUL MUSIC And then he told me. He goes... "You'll never do the things you want to do "because you haven't made a good decision "in your entire goddamn life." WRY CHUCKLE But you know what...? GUNSHOT TV PLAYS FAINTLY DISTANT SIRENS WAIL SHE PANTS DOOR OPENS DIANE VICKERS SCREAMS PHONE RINGS RINGING STOPS KENZO: Donna? Donna? GUNFIRE AND SCREAMING GUNSHOTS ON RADIO: The headlines this morning. A gunfight between warring gangs in the Soho area of London has left 15 people dead, with that number expected to rise. Police have not yet confirmed whether a double homicide in a West End hotel later in the evening was connected to the incident. I've got to go into work. They're calling everyone in. What are you going to say? I don't know. Don't lie for me. Don't lie for me Argentina? What? Nothing, it's... I make stupid jokes when I'm stressed. I don't know what I'm going to say. People are dying, Kenzo. IN JAPANESE: IN JAPANESE: BILL: Sarge... Chika Tani. Looks like our samurai sword guy was in the gun fight. Right. Get his mugshot distributed wide. I want all eyes out looking for him. Considered armed and dangerous? Considered very armed and incredibly fucking dangerous, Bill. Yes. INDISTINCT SPEECH ON VIDEO IN JAPANESE: PHONE RINGS IN JAPANESE: HE SIGHS My name is Chief Inspector Hayashi. Let me apologise, my English is poor. Better than my Japanese, I bet. How can I help? I am sad to inform you, your detective has been shot. What? There was a gun fight. He is recovering. Jesus. Roy in a gun fight. I am very sorry. There will be a full report. Yeah, well, I look forward to reading that. We've just had a shoot-out of our own, as it happens. Yes, I saw on the news. Here. Can I, err, can I send you something? PHONE VIBRATES Do you recognise him? No. I am sorry. I do not know him. I just had a call from Tokyo. Roy has been in a gun fight. Got shot in the arse. Any other week, that'd be big news. Is he OK? Well, won't be able to sit down for a while, you know how much he likes doing that. Suspect in the Saburo murder. Massacre in Soho. One of our officers gets shot in Tokyo. It makes you think, don't it? What's the name of that guy that they sent over on Roy's exchange programme? Your student? Detective Mori. Yeah, that's it. Get him in here, will you? Not to be disrespectful to all the people who lost their lives, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that your uncle is an absolute specimen of a man. I mean, drape a curtain round him, have him point at a naked baby and he'd be a fucking renaissance painting, do you know what I mean? Jesus. I was like, "Oh, my God, now I know why everyone's making "such a fuss about this guy." Again, with respect. Sorry, are you worried about him? I'm worried about everyone. Right, well, let's take your mind off it, shall we? What would you like to see? Southbank? Trafalgar Square? Hyde Park? Jack the Ripper's fourth victim was Catherine Eddowes. Another unfortunate prostitute. Another unfortunate prostitute. Her throat had been cut and her abdomen torn open in a long, jagged incision. Oh, God. She was found here, in Mitre Square, in the City of London. PHONE RINGS IN JAPANESE: SHE CRIES SOFTLY How is he? Sleeping. He's been identified in the video footage. They're looking for him. They're going to find him. I mean, they're probably not expecting to find him here, but... It's OK. It's really, really not. My boss wants you to come in and see him. Why? There was a shooting in Tokyo. A British police officer was injured. I need a drink, do you need a drink? I need a drink. So let's get a drink. Come on. SOFT JAZZ MUSIC Busy week, eh? So, listen, I'm just going to say this. We crossed a line at some point. And I'm not entirely sure how we went from where we were to a gunshot Yakuza recovering in my bedroom. A lot of people are dead. And you and your brother were involved, and I am scanning the horizon with a fucking telescope looking for any sign of my comfort zone. I have put you in an impossible position. It's not impossible though. I just have to hand you all in. Then that's what you should do. So that's what I should do. There we are. So, your daughter's kind of brilliant. She is very, um, strong willed. Mm. My mother used to say this thing. I don't know how you translate it, but... It's a long walk around the garden of my pride. She used to say that about Yuto. Not you? No. So, do you say it to Taki? I don't... I don't think so. A girl would like to hear that from her father. Did your father talk to you like...? Oh, my God, my dad? You can't get him to shut up. He's a hugger. I used to be able to make him cry with a piano recital. Yeah, he's a sweetheart. That's what... When my mum left him, you know, I just thought, "He's so gentle and kind. "How could you hurt him so much, this man who'd do anything for us?" I mean, I get it now. She fell out of love. What can you do? You can't fake that. No? No! No. To carry on living with someone you no longer love is as deceitful as adultery. I met my wife in a shop. She was working there. She stocked the shelves. I would watch her...putting everything out. It was so neat. It was like an art. She made it like a painting. So, you just went up and started talking to her? No. Too shy at first. It took me weeks to talk to her. What did you say? The first time? Mm-hm. I remember. I said, "Good morning, Miss. It is a lovely day today." Solid. And what did she say? She said, "Yes. But it will rain tomorrow." Where did you go for your first date? HE SIGHS Come on! Where does one take a girl in Tokyo? A nice restaurant. How nice? Nice enough for my budget. Then I walked her home. And so you called her? Not right away. How long did you leave it? Two days. Wow! So you didn't play it cool then. I wanted to call her before I had got home. THEY CHUCKLE To wait that long was a torture. What if she forgot me? In the two days since your date? Yes. I don't think she'd have forgotten you. It's all very romantic. Yes, it was. For a long time. HE SIGHS And then? And then there were years. Two young people who met in the shop were gone, and instead there were two old people in their place. I'm sorry, this... I'm sorry. No, no, it's OK. I was with someone and it just... You're right. There were years. What are your...? Do you have any scars? Scars? Yeah. Um... Knife attack. A man I arrested. Oh, wow. Ouch. Why do you ask? I don't know. If there's a silence, I like to fill it. Silence makes you uncomfortable? A little bit. People think when they are not saying anything, they are not saying anything, but that's not the case. Well... ..I think I could go about 20 seconds. Oh, are you going to test me? OK. SHE WHISTLES Go. You made it. You can speak now. Chez Rodney. Hard to believe but all of this is mine. The butler shall take your bag to the East wing, dress down service is at noon. IN JAPANESE: Sure. Let's just gloss over the fact that your family did a live reading of Die Hard in the Trocadero last night. IN JAPANESE: Really? That's what you're thinking about? Is there a chance that you are, in fact, what those in polite society might call a gay lesbian homosexual? No. It was a rhetorical question. I could tell you were a baby dyke the second I laid eyes on you. I was just asking who she was. Sure. Because you want to touch each other's butts or whatever it is you people do. She's called Annie. No. I'm going to call her. She's probably out anyway. Unlike you. Fucking relax. She comes round here to smoke weed all the time. I'll be very subtle. As is my way. Good choice. PHONE RINGS Hiya. Where are you? Me and my friend want to get high. Taki. She was there last night. Yes! That's the one. OK, cool. Bye. "What, the cute Japanese girl?" Her words, not mine. I thought you were Korean. She's round the corner, she's popping round for a bit. Don't say I never do anything for you. IN JAPANESE: Down the hall, on the right. But the flush is stuck so if you need to do a poo, use the pub next door. You're welcome. PHONE VIBRATES PHONE VIBRATES I'm sorry we have taken up your bedroom. That's OK. In my family, people with shrapnel wounds always get first dibs. Just traditional that way. Sofa's fine for me. It won't be forever. Goodnight, Kenzo. Goodnight, Sarah. Look who showed up. Sooner than anyone could've predicted. Hi. Taki, right? Come on. So, skin up. LIGHTER CLICKS FLAME ROARS SHE INHALES AND EXHALES Hi. Hi. This is excellent. SOFTLY: Can I kiss you? Yes. OK, maybe I will. You're staring. Is that a problem? BREATHING DEEPLY RODNEY: When did she leave? Late. Did you two...? IN JAPANESE: Believe me, I have absolutely no interest in watching that ungodly business. I'll wash my sheets just in case. Ouch! What you doing? PHONE VIBRATES IN JAPANESE: COUGHING HE SIGHS COUGHING EMOTIVE MUSIC NO AUDIBLE SPEECH MUSIC STOPS PHONE VIBRATES HE SIGHS SHE GASPS KNOCKING ON GLASS Who are you? Who are you? I was looking for Sarah. She has gone to work. I wanted to talk to her. All right. Look, this window wasn't me. OK. She thinks it was, but...it wasn't. OK. OK. And, listen, if she... ..if she wants to get in touch, I'm staying at my mum's. If you just let her know that, yeah. Please. Thank you. OK. OK. IN JAPANESE: WATER RUNS HE SCOFFS HE SIGHS HE SCOFFS KNOCKING ON DOOR PHONE VIBRATES DRAMATIC MUSIC I wasn't sure if you'd still be here. I was worried you'd be gone. I'm still here. Good. PHONE RINGS IN JAPANESE: DRAMATIC MUSIC BABY CRIES # I gotta dance # I gotta dance # I gotta dance # I've gotta dance # I gotta dance # I said, I got two left shoes # And my feet are on backwards... #
