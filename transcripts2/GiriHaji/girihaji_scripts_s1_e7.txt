 Morning. You ever done that before? What? SHE EXHALES Slept with a girl? No. I can tell. What? Nothing. You're cute. I'm going back to Japan soon. Like, for the rest of your life, or...? Probably. I've always wanted to go to Japan. Ever seen those monkeys that sit in the hot pools? You know, in the snow? If I went to Japan, I'd go and see those monkeys. MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES

 My dad. PHONE CONTINUES VIBRATING HE SIGHS HEAVILY MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES Sarah? If you were planning on leaving, now would be a good time. Both of you. He hasn't gone to the police yet. How do you know? We don't hear sirens. Kenzo, get Taki. Go to the airport... And then run away? What happens to you? I don't know! It's...obstruction of justice harbouring an offender. It's a couple of years, maybe more. No! Well, it is! That's... That's what it is. You said he was staying at his mother's house. I'm not giving you the address. What's his name? Ian. What's his surname? Oh, what are you going to do, stab him in the back with a samurai sword?! No offence. Sarah! Look, I know you want to help but the last thing this situation needs is the damn Mori brothers riding in! They're still rebuilding Seoul after the last time you two got in a fight, remember? If you just tell us where we can find him, we could at least... I'm not telling you! We need to stop this! Yes, Kenzo, we do! We need to stop the lying and the violence and the... ..the chaos of this whole fucking thing! So, then, you go and rot in jail for us while we go and hide back in Tokyo? I'll face the consequences of my actions. Which will not involve sending the two of you off on some cockamamie mission to hunt my ex-boyfriend down! This isn't you, Kenzo. This is the man I... I don't want anyone else to get hurt. Please? HE SIGHS I don't want anyone else to get hurt either. Kenzo? Don't do this! I'm going to fix this. I promise! DOOR CLOSES BABY LAUGHS BIRDS CHATTER RING TONE PHONE VIBRATES PHONE CONTINUES TO VIBRATE PHONE CONTINUES TO VIBRATE SHE SIGHS BEEP SHE SIGHS STAFF AND CUSTOMERS LAUGH HE EXCLAIMS Fuck! HE SCOFFS Are you OK getting back from here? Hey, you should call me before you fly away for ever. MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES Huh?! PHONE VIBRATES HE SNORES QUIETLY Ah! Oh, my God! Fuck. DOORBELL RINGS Oops! SIREN WAILS RINGING TONE ON PHONE Hello? Ian, it's me. Please, can we meet? OK. I'll hear you out. Usual place. KNOCKING ON DOOR Japanese Colombo here thinks something's wrong. Jesus, what is it? What, you're just going to go and meet him? I'm going to try and talk him out of it. You put him in jail. He doesn't want to reason with you - he wants to destroy you. That's a risk we're gonna have to take. Take Taki to Kenzo's room and wait there. And don't do anything stupid. DOOR CLOSES POLICE SIREN WAILS SHE GASPS BABY GRISTLES THEY LAUGH GENTLY THEY LAUGH HEARTILY Back in the old local. It's still my local. Yeah, it might stay that way. It's not a million miles from Pentonville. Don't gloat, Ian. I'm not gloating. Believe me, this doesn't bring me any joy. Then why do it? You're not a malicious man. You don't know what kind of man I am. Yes, I do! No. You don't. I spent 18 months locked in a cage with people bouncing my head off the walls for fun. The sort of thing changes a man. Maybe I became something different in that time. Maybe you did, too. Half of London's looking for this guy and he's... ..what, just hanging out in... ..in your home? It's hard to explain. Yeah, I'd be fucking astonished if it wasn't. I got caught up in something. I think you know what that feels like? Yeah, I do. I did a bad thing and I was punished. But my intentions were pure. But you're giving shelter to a murderer. It's more complicated than that. Will you let me try and explain? I never got a chance to explain! I know. You never gave me a chance to ask for forgiveness. And I'm sorry. And you're angry and you've every right to be, but doing this won't bring back the time I took from you. It won't silence your demons. You have no idea about my demons. I know that I've just now let a tiny bit of fucking light back into my life and I know I don't deserve to ask it of you, I know that! Not after everything. But it's this one small bit of happiness I've got and so I am asking you - please. Please don't do this! HE SIGHS What are you doing? I'm doing the right thing for once. HE SIGHS Where the fuck did she put it? Yes! Oh, God I'm going to smoke this! HE EXHALES OK, you need to help me. How? What are you doing, Sarah? I mean, Jesus fucking Christ! You've ruined me. You took everything from me. I'm sorry. For fuck's sake, I loved you! TEARFULLY: I'm so sorry. I really am. RECORDING PLAYS BEEP HE SCOFFS DRAMATIC PERCUSSIVE MUSIC ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA SYSTEM RESONATES MOBILE PHONE RINGS TOSHIO LAUGHS Tell me the truth. Did you even care about the corruption or was it just... I cheated on you? Do you care that I've broken the law or do you just care that I put you in jail? It's mainly the jail thing, I'm not going to lie. I heard that Joyce stuck around. Yeah. It turned into this... something, I don't know. She never visited me while I was away. MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES HE SOBS QUIETLY Don't! So, this guy Kenzo... He's the tiny bit of light that you let in? Yes. Do you love him? That's really none of my business, is it? Part of my probation states I'm not allowed anywhere near you. So Christ know what'll happen if I turn up with pictures taken outside your flat. You'd be doing me a favour getting rid of these. You're a twat, d'you know that? You're a twat! Yeah. You're a fucking twat. SHE LAUGHS Look after yourself, Sarah Weitzmann. Thank you. And I really didn't put a snake in your letterbox. That's just...weird. Sorry! Sorry, mate. Sorry. PHONE KEYPAD BEEPS Police, please. Yeah, I've just seen a man on the canal in NW1. He's behaving very strangely and I think he's carrying a knife. POLICE RADIO CHATTER Right, fella. I'm gonna need you to put your hands up where I can see them. Nice and slow. What? Hands up. All right. Oh, whoa! All right, all right, all right! Look, all right. We have information that you might be carrying a weapon. Have you got anything sharp in here, anything we should know about? No! Are you going to tell me what the problem is, boys? Ah! No, no. Hang on, that's a mistake. I'm arresting you on suspicion of possession of a class A substance. You don't have to say anything, but anything you do say may harm your defence. OK, listen to me - my name's Ian Summers. I'm an ex-cop, right? Please, I'm on probation, mate! Don't... ..do it, please! Sir! Sir! TYRES SQUEAL Vera, this is 324 requesting medical assistance. SIRENS WAIL POLICE RADIO CRACKLES Kenzo, it's me. It's all sorted. You can come back. Call me when you get this. MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES You'll kill someone with this, Samurai Sword. You should be in jail! Wakizashi. What? It was a Wakizashi sword. Yeah, well... ..it probably don't make any difference to the guy that you shish kebab-ed with it. The man I murdered was a corrupt piece of shit. I did the world a favour. It don't make any difference. Murder is murder. And you know it. HE SLURPS CLICKS EMPTY HE GASPS DOOR CLOSES CAR DRIVES AWAY He's not going to recover! I was just trying to help. Oh, you helped, Rodney. You killed him - problem solved! I didn't mean for this to happen, I'm sorry. It's not good enough! You had no right! I know that. No, you don't know! You just... Look at you! Look what you did! God, you're a fucking poison! Sarah, I'm... Just leave me alone. Just leave me alone! Fuck! Ahh! RAIN PATTERS INTO CANAL MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES HE INHALES SHARPLY DRIER DROWNS OUT REMAINING SPEECH SHE HUMS POLICE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHONE RINGS SHE SIGHS HEAVILY BABY CRIES BABY CONTINUES TO CRY ..what happened was... Oh, gosh... Hi. Hey! Um, this is Taki. Hi. Hi. Er, these are my friends. What's up? You want a beer? How about a haircut? On the house? Could I stay with you for a little bit? I can't tonight, babe. Sorry. It's not that I don't want to, just... Life, you know? Sorry, I shouldn't have come here. Let me finish your hair at least! It's OK. Maybe you should go back to your dad. I'm sure he's worried about you. What are you going to do? I don't know. Last month I was in Japan. My brother was dead. I was a faithful husband. Now I look around and I don't know what's real and what's not. I came to London... ..and I met an English woman. Maybe that's what I know. I'm not English. Oh! I think you need to go and make sure your daughter's OK. And do what? I don't know! I need to think. I understand. We are not bad people... We just did bad things. Really, what's the difference? RECORD PLAYS MUSIC: Fall At Your Feet by Boy & Bear # I'm really close tonight # And I feel like I'm moving inside her # I'm lying in the dark # And I think that I'm beginning to know her # Let it go # I'll be there when you call # And whenever I fall at your feet # Whenever I touch your slow turning pain # You're hiding from me now... # SHE SCREAMS # There's something in the way that you're talking # The words don't sound right # I can hear them all moving inside her # Go, I'll be waiting when you call # Whenever I fall at your feet # You let your tears rain down on me # Whenever I touch your slow turning back... #
