 As two brothers briefly reunite, a daughter begins a new journey. A boy tries to make sense of a young life lost, and the part he had to play in it. Threats from the past rear their heads, and old scores need to be settled. In a night where drinks are raised to lost loves, and forgiveness and vengeance are sought in equal measure, chaos comes knocking on the door, and a promise of violence hangs heavy in the air.

Probably guns as well. Except you can't prove it yet. I don't need to prove it. I know it's true. Always a reassuring thing to hear from a policeman. Would a pain au chocolat cheer you up? No. Maybe. Last night, a lorry broke down in Slough. Nothing particularly remarkable about that, except for when a couple of uniforms turned up to help out, the driver pulled out a gun, started shooting at them. Silly prick. Turned out he had about 50 kilos of heroin in the back. Are we thinking it's linked to my gang? It could be connected to the Lenjani family. Speak to Joyce. See if you can get some time with the driver. Which one's Joyce? She's come over from CSE. She's new. Got it. Psst. Chinese tonight? LONDON ACCENT: What you doing, fam? What's tricks? Wagwan, piff ting? COCKNEY ACCENT: What's going on? Stop it! Bruv. I'm going through witness statements. Can I have my prawn crackers, please? Do you know how they make those? They mash the prawns up into a disgusting paste, and then they deep-fry them. Uh-huh. It's gross. Mm. Why don't you stop for the night? Crime doesn't sleep, and neither do I. That had better have been a joke. It was. It was! Cos every time I go in there, it's like a bloody sauna. And Dad can't stand the heat... SURPRISE! Happy birthday! Jesus Christ. I almost maced you, you twats. CHATTERING I think we should start getting the shots in soon. I'm going to... I'm behaving myself today. So... ..how old are you, then? Oh, fuck off. He suggested this place. We went on a date here a couple of years ago. Yeah. He's a good lad. He IS a good lad. Straight-forward. You know what you're getting. Another one of these, please. What? Nothing. I just know you. And what does that mean? Look around. Your friends, your team. Good food, good wine, good laughs. Good God, get to the point. Just saying. This is it. This is what it's all about. It's a very nice party, Steve. Happy birthday. DOOR OPENS THUMP What were you and Angling talking about all night? Nothing. It looked serious. I'm a serious man. Seriously... ..stupid. I see you've honed your razor-sharp wit to a devastating point. SHE LAUGHS Wine. Good wine. Good wine, good food, good laughs. HE LAUGHS What? Nothing. OK. Happy birthday. Thank you. BELT RATTLES Oh. Where are you going? Bedroom. No! Here. What's wrong with the bedroom? Boring. Thanks very much. Aw, no, I didn't mean... What? What's the matter?! What's the matter with you? Nothing! I'd like my boyfriend to fuck me over the kitchen counter once in a while. I'm not asking for the moon on a stick, Ian. Where are you going? I'm tired. Aw, fuck sake! Good weekend, Roy? Not really. Found out our dog's got diabetes. Bloody loved that dog. What do you think of Joyce? Seems all right. She's from Brighton. So? Nothing. Just never really met anyone from Brighton that wasn't secretly a bit of a twat is all. Oh, right, yeah. Maybe. I don't really know. PHONE VIBRATES Who's A? Just an informant. You shouldn't give them your personal number. This guy's harmless. Don't worry. DOOR OPENS FOOTSTEPS APPROACH DOOR OPENS Where were you? Drinks with Steve. I should have called. I'm sorry. It's this fucking case. You started smoking again? Just the odd one. It's bad for you. If it was really bad, they'd put a big warning on the pack. How's the case? Going nowhere. Do you ever think about how everything we do is an echo of something? Like, how everything we've done is going to happen again, and...everything we're going to do has already happened somewhere else. And we're all just... ..dancing around each other like atoms, and we can't even stroke a hair from our face without it affecting the lives of a billion people. Like, how...every tiny split second decision we make can potentially have a vast, profound effect on everyone around us. And maybe it's all planned. Everything that is going to happen was always going to happen, as if we're all being moved by this mad conductor. We've all been here before. Just one endless round and round. It's something we can't control. All we can do is hang on and hope it sets us down in a better place than it picked us up. Yeah, or maybe you're stoned. How's Ian? Meh. Distant. Like the distant ripples on a pond thrown up by the stones of fate. No, like a prick who can't tell his fucking girlfriend where he is. SHE LAUGHS Hey. You all right? Another drink? PHONE VIBRATES No. I'm all right with this. See you later, all right? Bye. DOOR SHUTS IAN OVER RADIO: Kilo Two Three Zero, requesting back up. Suspect's on the move, east down Stoker Street. HORN BEEPS Your boy got 'em, Weitzmann. Bloody got 'em. Oleee-ole-ole! Go on, Ian, get in there! Ole-e! Ole-e! Oleee-ole-ole-ole! Ole, ole! DOOR SLAMS KEY CLATTERS HE SIGHS Sir, I need to talk to you about something. Thank you. I can manage. MOUTHS: OK. What was all that about? Listen, Joyce, it's really all I can do to stop myself punching you in the fucking face right now, so probably best if you don't speak or look at me again. OK? REPORTERS CALL OUT Detective Weitzmann, can you describe for the court what you saw on the morning of the 14th of January 2018? I saw the defendant handing an object to a mid-thirties white male that came to the door of a flat on the high street. Do you know who owns that flat? Yes. It's owned by Mr Ivan Lenjani, who was under investigation at the time, suspected of drug trafficking and firearm offences. All rise. Has the jury reached a verdict? We have. Do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty? Guilty. REPORTER: The conviction of Met detective Ian Summers for the planting of false evidence has led to the release from prison of Albanian national Ivan Lenjani, who was previously sentenced for drug trafficking. Sarah. Sarah, look at me. Fucking look at me! You'll regret this. Get the fuck off! You'll fucking regret this! REPORTER: DC Summers was found guilty of perverting the course of justice and was today handed a six year sentence.

HE GASPS MAN SHOUTS LOUD RUMBLING Like every action we take is the consequence of a thousand different actions, and will result in a thousand more actions after it. That every tiny split second decision we make... ..could potentially have a vast, profound effect on everyone around us. Or maybe it's all planned. Everything that was going to happen was always going to happen. As if someone was moving us all, like this mad conductor. SHE READS Come on. HE GROANS IN PAIN We've all been here before.
