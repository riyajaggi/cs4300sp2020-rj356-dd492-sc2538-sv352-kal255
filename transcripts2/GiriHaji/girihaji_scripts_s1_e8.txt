 Neither do I. Everything's pretty fucked, isn't it? Is there a Japanese expression for that? For everything being fucked? Nanimo kamo mechakuchada. What does that mean? It translates as "everything is messed up". Nanimo kamo... ..mechakuchada. Well, that about covers it. I prefer "everything is fucked". I sent Rodney away. You were angry. I'm still angry but I'm just worried now too. So call him. Yeah. Kenzo, I need to know... It would be helpful to know if this meant something. If it was important. I suppose what I want to know is if there's scope for things to become... ..un-fucked someday, maybe. PHONE BEEPS Yuto's calling me. Saved by the bell. You'd better answer. Um, I'll speak to you later. Yes. It's all meant something to me. It was important. Last call for Tokyo, Japanese Airlines, number... Oi! Now, if I was a man like you and I had fucked off a man like me to the extent that you have, there's no way I'd still be living at my registered address. I'm strangely disappointed in you, Kenzo. Please, I cannot do this now. Oh, well, let me know when's a more convenient time for you and I'll come back. Where's Yuto? Huh? I will fucking shoot you. Fukuhara sent men to find him. They kidnapped my daughter. Yuto is on his way to confront him. They kidnapped your daughter? Yes. What are you doing here then? Why aren't you going to get her back? You're pointing a gun at me. Right. Well, we're all going to the same place. Lead the way, maestro. Go on. You've tried to reach Rodney but he's unavailable. The tragedy. You may leave a message. ANSWERPHONE BEEPS Rodney, it's me. I'm just calling to... ..I don't know, talk to you, make sure you're safe, if you're feeling OK. I know you're not, but... ..call me back. It's not as bad as you think. Or it is. You should call me anyway. Sarge, where have you been? We've had half the station looking for you. Yeah, I got fucking kidnapped. Eh? You what? They blindfolded me. He wasn't alone? No, there was another one. Sir... ..Ian's dead. What? Some uniforms were bringing him in on a possession charge. He ran out in the road, got rolled over a bonnet. Possession of what? Crack cocaine. Crack cocaine? What the fucking hell? He was stop and searched? There was a call about a man acting suspiciously, possible knife. He fit the description. He rang me earlier, said he wanted to talk to me about something. I was going to call back. Guv'nor, there's something you need to see. Double murder in the Silvana Hotel, night of the battle of Soho. Ellis Vickers and Donna Clark, both known associates of Connor Abbot. Clark's phone had bullet damage but the lab managed to get this off the SIM Card - The last number she called. What is it? It's a foreign mobile. Kenzo Mori. Where's Sarah? CAR HORN Oi, slow down! My daughter needs me. Yeah, and I'm sympathetic to that, but let's please be mindful of the paintwork, shall we? You ain't going to be no use to your daughter if you crash my fucking car. I'm a trained police driver. Yeah, so? So I'm not going to crash the fucking car. CAR HORNS CAR HORNS MUSIC: Heal by Tom Odell Oh, sweetheart! Oh, what a lovely surprise! You're lucky I was in. Wednesday's usually my Spanish lesson but it got cancelled. Sit yourself down. I'm making a stew to use the veggies up before they turn. Do you want wine? Yeah. So what brings His Majesty to the outskirts? Don't know. You look pale, love. Are you getting enough sleep? So what happened? What? Who is he? It's always the same, isn't it? I used to be away for weeks on end until some man broke my heart and then I would come running back home to Granny, floods of tears. She used to call it my "heartbreak tour". I haven't seen you for six months, Mum. So how is the city? How is my London? I don't get in hardly as much as I should. You're enjoying it, yeah? Still in Soho? I hear everyone's moving east these days. Follow the artists. That's what used to get me into trouble, anyway. It isn't so great, actually, at the moment. It's all gone a bit wrong. Don't really know what I'm doing. Oh, no. No, don't say that. I like thinking of you out there having fun. That's what life's about, Rodney. It's about having fun. If you're sad, I'm sad. I don't want to be sad. That's better. There's my handsome boy. Is it all right if I have a bath? Yeah, of course. You know where everything is. Yeah. WATER RUNNING HE BREATHES HEAVILY MUSIC: Heal by Tom Odell HE SOBS BABY CRYING HE SIGHS Vickers is dead. Him and Donna. They made it out, apparently, but then... I don't know. Makes you think, though, don't it, if there ain't an easier way to make a living? You're working with Shin Endo. Well, yeah, I was supporting him with money and guns and that, so... I was going to go out there when the war was won. It was Yuto's idea, till he fucked me over. Why did you want to get involved in Japan? Did you really think the Yakuza were going to accept you? No, not really, but then again no-one in London ever did. Opening doors isn't always about knocking politely. Sometimes you've just got to fucking kick them down, do you know what I mean? Yeah, this is it. How many can we expect up there? There's three of them. Right, well, what we need to do... Police! Don't move. Don't be daft. Put that down. You're under arrest. Sarah, what are you doing here? What are YOU doing here? They've got Taki. Who's got Taki? Yakuza. They will kill her if we don't hurry. What? Nothing, I'm weighing up my options. How old's your daughter? 16. Right, well, let's deal with that first and then we'll address the Yuto situation. Did I not just say you're under arrest? Yeah, but I'm willing to put that behind us. Sarah, you don't have to come up if you don't want to. You go, I go. Bloody hell, you've had that the whole time? Unbelievable. DOOR BANGS OPEN Konichiwa, dickheads! Put her down. Oi! I know that look, I've given that look. It means, "Shoot that fucker." Kenzo, what did he say? He said he was giving him a look. Yeah, I knew it. Just hold on. Yuto isn't here yet. What are we going to do, kill each other? Easy, easy. Oh, my God. You what? What? Phone? Phone! You ain't getting my phone. Phone! Phone! All right, all right, chill out. Fucking Chinese ET. You get one call. Thank you. PHONE RINGS GUNSHOTS, THEY SCREAM Oh, Jesus. 20 grand on blackjack? You do realise you're allowed to stick, don't you? It got away from me. Oh, really? Do you think so, Roy? Right, she's going to break one of your arms now. No, please. I can get the money. No, but you can't, though, can you, Roy? Not on your salary, you can't. Listen. Just... Argh! Look, no-one wants to do this, Roy, but I don't see that you've left me much choice. I'll sell my car. Argh! What do you drive? Nissan Micra. Argh! My wife, she's got jewellery. She's got all sorts. It's worth a fortune. If it was worth fortunes, you'd have already stuck it in the fixies up Ladbrokes, you fucking reprobate. No, no, please, it's silver and this weird green stuff. What is it...? He'll know. Why would he know anything about your wife's jewellery? Well, it's Japanese stuff. Traditional. You know, the green, twirly, necklace thing they have. What's it called? Jade? Jade! That's it. Jade, jade. Is your wife Japanese? Yeah. A little. Roy... ..there might be a way we could let that 20 G slide. It's being picked up by an Eiji Watari. I can send them your number. Yeah. OK. OK. Hi. Yeah, come back when Fukuhara's been dealt with. All right? Now get on with it. KNOCK ON DOOR HE EXHALES GUNSHOT HE WAILS It's OK. I-I don't speak Japanese, I'm sorry. I speak a little English. OK, great. There was a call... I was sent by my boss. Captain Hayashi. BABY COOS I need to take you all home. I promise you, you'll be safe. "Safe"? PHONE BUZZES Right, can I get some translation, please? Otherwise I'm just a prick waving a gun about. Why are you here? Cos me and you have got unfinished business. Right? But until you've rescued your niece from this fucking boyband, I've agreed to put a temporary halt to proceedings. Fine. Please, someone, what did he say? He wants us to put our guns down. Well, that's a stupid fucking idea. No, do it. Taki! Taki, honey, come down. SATNAV GIVES DIRECTIONS IN JAPANESE PHONE KEYS BEEP Hey, no phones. THEY SCREAM SARAH SCREAMS Aww. That's a nice moment. Maybe we file this one under unfinished business, all right? I can give you a couple of hours' head start. The pursuit of perfection. Don't flatter yourself. SIRENS WAIL Oh. Hark. I hear the sirens sing. You three might want to be getting off. The rozzers could show up any minute. Oi! HE WHISTLES You're still in my town, remember. Act accordingly. Fucking amateurs. BABY CRIES SIRENS WAIL Sorry. I'm so sorry. THEY LAUGH MUSIC: Hello Stranger by Barbara Lewis So what happens now? You're going to hand me in. I hope he runs. I hope he gets away. I hope he misses us. Not too much. Not for too long. I hope he finds what he's looking for. And what about us? What did she say? # It seems like a mighty long time # My baby, ooh # It seems like a mighty long time... # # Please don't tease me like you did before # Because I still love you so # Although # It seems like a mighty long time # My baby, ooh # It seems like a mighty long time # Oh, oh, my, my, my # I'm so happy... #
