 Latin lover narrator:
Welcome back. Let's review
what happened last.
 When jane was young,
her grandmother taught her
 To protect her flower.
 And so jane waited...
 Which wasn't always easy.
 This is jane's fiancÃ©.
 He's a detective.
 Their life was
perfectly on track, until...
 Oh, there you are,
dr. Alver.
 You have an insemination
in seven and a path in eight.
 Alver: Yeah, an insemination
and a path, yeah, I got it.
 Should I...
No, I-I got it.
 She does not "got it."
 Are you ready
for your insemination?
(snores) hi. Yes.
 I artificially inseminated
the wrong woman.
 And the father,
dr. Alver's brother, rafael,
 Who jane kissed once
five years ago,
 Only now he's married to petra.
 Got all that?
There's more.
 Jane did not know that her
favorite telenovela star
 Was actually her father,
who her mother
 Recently got
back in touch with.
 And now you are caught up.
 â™ª
 Jane's quinceaÃ±era was,
without a doubt,
 The worst party
she'd ever been to.
 But not for lack of effort.
 In fact, jane had planned
the day down to a tee.
 The flowers.
 The entrance.
 The perfectly
choreographed dance
 With the superfly date.
 What she didn't plan?
That her mother
 Would take over the mike
and perform
 The number one hit
currently sweeping the nation.
 â™ª my milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard â™ª
 â™ª and they're like,
it's better than yours â™ª
 â™ª it's better than yours...
 But to her credit,
 Jane did not panic.
 She simply moved on.
 Who wants cake?
 No, thank you, abuela.
 I'm not hungry.
 And jane was determined
to move on now.
 Yes, I know,
but that is not gonna be
 The focus of everything
moving forward.
 I'm gonna... I'm gonna
get back to my life.
 In fact,
 That's the reason why I
called this family meeting.
 Michael, welcome
to your first family meeting.
 Happy to be here.
Proud to be representing
 The male point of view.
 Ooh. Oh, see,
I wouldn't lead
 With that, 'cause that's not
gonna do well in our meetings.
 I'm mostly here
to watch and observe.
 So, I just wanted
to go over the plan.
 All right?
The most important thing
 Is that this... Event...
 Doesn't derail my life.
 Nothing else has changed.
All right?
 I'm almost at the finish line
with college.
 I got a good job.
I'm engaged to a great guy.
 Sure, there are
 A few logistical things
I'm gonna have to do
 To make sure it...
Stays in good health,
 Like I set up a sonogram,
for instance.
 But other than that,
nothing has changed.
 Got it?
 Yes. Go ahead.
 Abuela!
 She said that I should
keep the baby.
 Oh! No, she's not
keeping the baby.
 Stop, abuela.
 I'm not gonna
keep the baby.
 I-in fact,
 We're not gonna refer
to it as a baby.
 We're gonna... We're gonna
call it something else.
 W... We are going
to call it, um...
 â™ª my milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard... â™ª
 ...A milkshake.
 And I can't wait to
give that milkshake
 To its rightful owners--
 Good people who
really want it.
 I want a divorce.
 Well, I don't.
 And jane's not gonna give
you that child on your own.
 (scoffs): Yeah.
 I know.
 Just like I know
 That you're trying
to wait out our prenup
 To make money off me.
 So, tell me, sweetheart...
 How are we gonna
work through that?
 (knocking on door)
 Hey, man, how
you holding up?
 Good.
Yeah?
 We're good.
 Catalina creel?
Seriously, abuela?
 Who is catalina creel?
This super psycho
telenovela villain
 Who wore an eye patch
everywhere even though
she wasn't really blind.
 (ringtone playing)
petra's not a super psycho.
 Jane: Okay,
you know what?
 I... Am gonna meet with petra.
 She's just texted me.
 She'd like to meet.
 Sounds lovely.
 Great. She is excited
to set something up.
 Are you happy?
 And once I meet
with her, I am going
 To think about this pregnancy
as little as possible.
 I'm gonna get back to my life.
 Uh-uh. No way.
 After that, you sue
the frickin' doctor.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes,
 The frickin' doctor.
Okay.
 The frickin' doctor was trying
to move forward as well.
 Mrs. Diana t. Gower.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
 Can you just say your name
one more time,
 And this time
would you mind
 Also spelling it slowly?
 Twice-- you can never
be too careful.
 The nurse said
you were between patients.
 Well...
 I'm sure the mistake
will be dealt with
 Through
the appropriate channels,
 And since I haven't
received the...
 Official notification
that my license is suspended,
 I figured I should
just keep practicing.
 (computer chimes)
 Oh, okay, there's
the official notification.
 My license is suspended.
 Luisa, you're not
drinking are you?
 No.
 No, I'm not.
What I'm doing is
 That I'm trying to be practical,
which is why I called you.
 I mean, you were
a pretty good lawyer
 Before you gave it up
to become a trophy wife.
 Take care of yourself.
 No, stop it. I'm sorry.
 I don't know
why I said that.
 I'm going through a lot,
 And I'm lashing out. I...
 I need your help.
 I called my insurance company,
and there's
 This thing in my policy.
 It mentions my brother,
and I'm not sure I understand it
 Because of all
the legal jargon.
 Zaz:
You put your shares
 Of the hotel up as collateral?
 In case of a lawsuit, yeah.
 Look, no one would insure luisa
with her history of addiction.
 She's my sister.
 And I believed her
when she said she'd changed.
 So if jane sues me...?
 Your brother's hotel
could be on the line.
 I just don't want
to spend the next year
 In a whole legal battle.
I just want
 To keep moving forward
with my life.
 (ringtone plays)
finish college, obsess
about wedding dresses--
 And who keeps
calling you, mom?
 Can you ask rafael if I can sing
at the hotel next month?
 I heard paulina rubio's
 Producer might be in town, so...
 Is it bruce?
 (ringtone continues)
 Yeah, it's bruce.
Mom!
 Latin lover narrator:
It is important to note
 That bruce is xiomara's
 Married ex-boyfriend.
 Stop calling!
 It is also important
to note that that was
 Not bruce calling.
In fact,
 It was jane's father,
who xo saw out of the blue
 16 months ago.
 Seeing her
high school boyfriend
 On a telenovela was shocking.
 So xiomara did
the only sensible thing.
 She rushed home to google him.
 Jane:
Hey.
 Who's the hottie?
 â™ª
 But alas,
jane didn't know any of that.
 Yet.
 And so for a brief moment,
 As jane went to work
that morning,
 It truly felt
like nothing had changed.
 Jane.
 Hi. I'm sorry to
ambush you like this.
 I just wanted to talk
really quickly about the...
 (quietly):
Uh... The baby.
 Like I said,
the moment was brief.
 Oh. Yes. Hi.
Hey.
 I actually texted your wife.
Yes, I heard.
 Yeah, I was just trying
to put a name to the face
 And make sure
she didn't have an eye patch.
 What?
 Nothing. That was
a bad joke. Sorry.
 I am really excited
to meet her.
 And, you know,
see the whole picture
 And the two-parent-home thing.
 Right.
 So, that's pretty
important to you, huh?
 Yeah, it's the reason why
I feel good about my decision.
 Sorry, what was it
that you wanted to talk
 To me about?
 In truth, he decided
 To come clean to jane and
tell her his marriage is over.
 Just some... Lawsuit
stuff, actually.
 But alas, plans change.
 You're suing?
 (laughs):
No. I'm not suing.
 Just... Luisa, dr. Alver,
is my sister, so it's...
 What?
The... Doctor who
inseminated you.
 She's your sister?
 She's... Your sister?
 Yes. But I mean, we're not
on good terms, obviously.
 No, but she's, like,
really your sister?
 (stammering quietly)
 I just... Wow.
 And not to make things
more awkward...
 But, jane, you should
really talk to a lawyer.
 Come up with an amount,
present it to us,
 And that way I can
pay you directly,
 And that way you'll
make the most money.
 What makes you think
that I want money?
 I don't know, I just
assumed, because...
 Because I'm a waitress?
 No. I... I know you're
not just a waitress.
 "just a waitress."
that's not
what I meant.
 Look, you're in college...
So if I wasn't
 In college, I would be
"just a waitress."
 Jane, I think you're
taking this the wrong way.
 Yeah. Maybe I am.
 Except this huge thing
just happened,
 And you're telling me
that your sister did it,
 And then you're
offering me money.
 I got to change.
 Seriously, what did you expect?
 He's a rich playboy.
 Rich playboy
with an entitled attitude,
 Missing a basic
sensitivity chip.
 He was so much nicer
in my head.
 That's because
he's a good kisser.
 What?!
You kissed him?
 You slut!
When?
 It was five years ago.
Not a big deal.
 What did magic mikey
say when you
 Told him?
Did he freak out?
 No.
 Because I haven't
actually told michael yet.
 He just found out the news
about my pregnancy,
 And I want it to settle-- I just
don't want it to be weird.
 Or weirder.
 It's definitely weirder.
 I'm trying to find
the right moment.
 Before he meets rafael.
 Obviously. Whatever.
 I'm sure rafael
is a fine guy.
 We just had one bad interaction;
I'm just gonna let it go.
 What?
Nothing.
 Just heard some things
about him over the years.
 What kind of things?
 Latin lover narrator:
Very bad things.
 Very, very bad things.
 Oh, my god.
 It is important to know
that, right now,
 Jane is panicking.
 We're gonna have to keep it.
I don't want to,
 And you don't want to,
 But we're gonna have to.
 W-wait-wait,
what's going on, jane?
 I can't give rafael
the milkshake.
 Latin lover narrator:
It is important to note
that michael cordero jr.
 Is not a virgin.
 Well, it's important to him.
 I don't really care
about it too much.
 But what is important to know
 Is that michael never planned
to date a virgin.
 But when he met jane,
everything changed.
 Oh. Oh.
 Okay, okay.
I thought about it.
 This doesn't mean
that we have to keep it, right?
 There has got to be some
legal loophole that we can find.
 We'll declare him unfit,
we'll find other good parents.
 Okay, calm down,
slow down.
Did you see what I sent you?
 Did you click on the links?
Yeah. I wish you
would've warned me
 Before the bora bora series.
 Michael, don't you think
 That I have a moral obligation
to make sure
 That the milkshake goes
to a decent person?
 And that is not a decent person.
 What he did in bora bora
is not decent.
 It literally is indecent,
which is why he got arrested.
 And it was also a while ago.
(sighs)
 You said the guy
had cancer, right?
 He obviously went through some
major life-changing event.
 You know, he's marr..
He's happily married now.
 Trust me, bora bora
guy doesn't want a baby.
 Yeah, I mean,
that's definitely true.
 Look, I get why you're anxious,
 But, uh, you-you're gonna
meet the wife, right?
 Mm-hmm.
I bet you'll feel
better when you do.
 Give this guy a real chance.
 Huh.
 So, I just stood there,
talking to her about money
 And lying about my marriage.
 Well, petra's
trying at least.
 Driving my staff crazy,
 Wanting everything to be perfect
for the party tonight.
 She's trying
to impress my father.
 Yeah, so you
look good.
 It's his first time
seeing the renovations.
 He's got to
be blown away
 If he's gonna trust
you to run things here.
 Petra knows how
important this is to you.
 Yeah, maybe,
or maybe she knows
 That if she gets my father
on her side,
 It will be that much harder
for me to leave her.
 Wow.
 So, you're pretty
much done then, huh?
 Yeah. I am.
 Why did she order
an ice sculpture of a wizard?
 I said marlin, not merlin!
 A marlin? Like the fish?
 Yes, like the fish!
 (sighs) my father-in-law
loves to fish.
 Does he also like magic?
 (growling)
 (growling)
 We got a leopard on the loose!
 (people screaming,
bell ringing)
 (screaming continues)
 We need to
talk right now.
 (leopard growling)
 (excited chatter in background)
 You can't keep calling me!
I said I'd tell her
 When the time is right,
and I'll tell her!
 When? I want to be a part
of my daughter's life.
 You kept her from me
long enough.
 Yeah, well, you
shouldn't have told me
 To have an abortion.
Shh. I was just a kid.
 Yeah, yeah, I know, I know,
and I was just a kid
 When I told my mom you
were some random army guy,
 And now it's been
so long, and I...
 (sighs heavily)
 Uh, I know it's hard, xiomara.
 And I was a screw-up years ago,
but I have changed.
 I want my daughter to have
the pleasure of knowing me.
 I want to be a part
of her life.
 Yeah... Okay, I'll
tell her... Today.
 Good. What is she like?
 Jane? Oh.
 She's awesome.
 Smart, strong, determined.
 Pregnant.
 I am to be a grandfather?
 Kind of.
 It was a medical mistake.
 Long story.
 Who's the father?
 But I honestly hoped this baby
would be a real chance for us.
 Because you might have stopped
loving me,
 But I never stop loving you.
 Okay... Better, but I think
 You'd be more effective
if you'd make yourself cry.
 Just, like, one tear.
 I haven't cried since
I was a child, zaz.
 God, I hate that I have to
humiliate myself like this.
 I know, but this
baby angle isn't gonna last.
 You're gonna have
to make him love you again.
 What if I can't?
Oh, please.
 With your... Arsenal...
 Of weapons, hmm? Hmm?
 Come on!
 You only have to last
one more year.
 Then, you'll cash out
of your prenup,
 And we can get
the hell out of here.
 Michael:
Girl's in there again.
 Don't need to watch this part.
 What a waste of time.
Nothing's happening.
 We've only been here 48 hours.
 Cortes named roman zazo
as a contact.
 If he's right,
this is the first real lead
 We've had on sin rostro
in four years.
 We haven't heard from sin rostro
in four years because he's dead.
 You know what
would be great?
 If partner wasn't always
working against me.
 You don't go from
the biggest drug game in town
 To radio silence,
unless you're six feet under.
 Or regrouping,
planning something big.
 (phone chimes)
 Finally... An I.D.
On the woman.
 I don't know what
took all damn day.
 Petra solano.
 Oh, wow.
 Apparently, she's the wife
 Of the guy who owns the hotel.
 Latin lover narrator:
Try to remember, later,
 That michael's first thought
in this moment was jane.
 He had to tell...
 Jane.
 Hey. I just wanted to apologize
for what happened earlier.
 The truth is, I have no idea
how to act around you.
 No, it's fine.
 So I should get back
to work. You know,
 Trying to get on with my life,
not constantly think about it.
 Yeah, that makes sense.
Mm-hmm.
 Just one more thing.
What's that?
 I would love to come
to any doctor's appointments?
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted
that at this very moment,
 All jane wanted to do
was scream "no!"
 But alas, michael said
to give him another try.
 I actually have a sonogram
scheduled for this afternoon.
 Why don't you
and your wife come?
 Really?
I mean, you definitely
don't have to.
 Great.
Great.
 What are you doing?
 Focusing on the bright side.
 Drinking will not
solve anything.
 I know, but every
time I don't drink,
 I feel good about myself,
 And I need something
to feel good about,
 Because my brother
won't speak to me,
 My wife cheated on me,
and I have nowhere to go,
 And I'm about to be slapped
with a huge lawsuit.
 But I'm not drinking.
 At least I'm
not drinking.
 You're crazy.
You know that?
 Don't call me crazy.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
 Oh, we can't.
 I know.
 (moaning)
 Oh! Oh! Oh!
 Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.
 They're running late.
Are you there?
 Yup, I am here.
 Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.
 Woman:
Amy nesson?
 Michael:
Are you
 Clo...
 Michael?
 Woman:
Hi. Come on in.
 Hey.
Okay, thanks.
 Sorry. Hey, yeah.
 Sorry. This place is...
Really weird.
 Um, are you close?
 Yes. Listen, is, uh, rafael
and petra there yet?
 No.
Jane:
Okay, good, good.
 'cause I wanted to tell you
something before you met him,
 Which wasn't going
to be today, but now it is,
 And it's so not a big deal,
 But you should know it
before you meet him,
 Or it might be a little strange
when you do know.
 Know what?
 I kissed rafael once,
five years ago.
 What?!
 Yeah, way before I met you.
 Okay, and it was so
not a big deal.
 It was nothing really,
you know?
 I mean, nothing then;
it means nothing now.
 Rafael:
You must be michael.
 Hi. I'm rafael.
 We'll talk
about this later, jane.
 I used to make out
with jane all the time.
 What?
I asked if
they're running on time?
 Oh, yes, I think so.
 Michael cordero,
jane's fiancÃ©.
 Oh, I didn't know
you two got engaged.
 Yeah, yeah.
It just happened.
 We're, like, super happy.
 We're really in love, big time.
 (laughs)
 Just trying to get
through this crazy... Accident.
 Yes. Us, too.
 Petra solano.
Such a pleasure to meet you.
 What your fiancÃ©e
is doing for us--
 It's such a gift.
(woman speaking spanish)
 Shut it, mom.
We wouldn't be late
 If you hadn't made me change
out of my booty shorts.
 I didn't know
you two were coming.
 Oh. Trust me,
a girl needs her mom.
 Are you...?
 The father, yes.
Hi. I'm rafael.
 I'm jane's mom.
 And, yes, I had
her very young.
 I'm so sorry. I...
 I'm late.
 You must be petra.
 Yes.
 (both laugh)
 It is so nice
to finally meet you.
 You're making our
dreams come true.
 Technician:
Jane villanueva?
 Hi.
 Hi. Come on in.
 (clears throat)
grams.
 This is my grandma.
Great. Hi.
Welcome.
 Oops. Sorry.
Just gonna get in there.
 Technician:
Excuse me.
 Oh, sorry. Sorry. Ma, back up.
(overlapping chatter)
 You know what?
 I'm gonna have
to ask some of you to leave.
 Oh, no, no,
I can't leave.
(overlapping chatter)
 Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Who are the parents?
 I'm the father.
Just carrying the baby, so,
I should probably stay.
 I'm supposed be the mother,
technically.
 My fiancÃ©.
I'm the fiancÃ©.
 (overlapping chatter)
okay, you know what?
 I'm gonna go on biology.
 So you and you.
 Everyone else, out.
 Thank you.
Good luck, baby.
 Okay.
(quiet chatter)
 Okay.
 I appreciate that.
Thank you.
 Technician:
All right.
 This is gonna be
cold, okay?
(sighs)
 You're about seven weeks
along, is that right?
 Yes.
 Okay, I'm gonna get started.
 Will you be wanting pictures?
 Yes.
No.
 (computer whirring)
 So, what are you studying?
 Teaching.
Just one more semester.
 Nice.
 (gasps lightly)
 I googled you.
Oh?
 Mm.
That couldn't have gone well.
 No, it didn't.
 Hey, you see...?
 Yup, mm-hmm.
 (sighs)
oh, god.
 I was pretty lost
a year and a half ago.
 And when I got sick,
I just went to this really...
 Dark place, you know?
 So, what changed?
 My sister, actually.
 She came over one day
and told me
 To stop feeling sorry
for myself,
 And that I'd find
the bright side.
 It's what I needed
to hear, I guess.
 So, I started to focus on
the things that I should change,
 Which ended up pretty much
being my entire life.
 So what made you so lost
to begin with, do you think?
 Fear of failure.
 That's what it is.
 It's fear of failure.
 Which can be
a pretty crippling thing.
 Yeah, I know.
 Is that why you're trying to be
a teacher and not a writer?
 (laughs)
 Well, it depends.
 Am I being
practical or brave?
 Practical.
 I'm a teacher.
 Brave.
 I'm a writer?
 I have never said that
out loud before.
 So what have you been writing?
 Not writing anything right now.
 What do you want to be writing?
 Romance.
 Romance?
 Mm-hmm.
 Really?
(laughs)
 Little early
to hear the heartbeat.
 (steady heartbeat over monitor)
 Latin lover narrator: It was
all a little early indeed.
 And now, I implore you
to remember
 That michael's first thought
 Upon learning
about petra's affair,
 Was jane, he had to tell jane.
 End the affair.
 I don't know what
you're talking about.
 Then I'll be clear then.
 Stop sleeping with roman zazo.
 How...?
 Came by the hotel,
saw you together.
 Where?
Doesn't matter.
 Do you even want this baby?
 Yes, of course
I want this baby, I'm...
 Then end it.
 Or I'll tell your husband.
 And, trust me, jane's not
giving that baby to him alone.
 And you don't want it.
 Fine.
 I'll end it.
 Who knows? Maybe I'll ask you
for a favor at some point.
 Talked to rafael.
 Everything's
gonna be fine.
 Good.
 That's good.
 I want you to quit your job.
 What?
 I-it's, it's too much.
 You're carrying
the guy's baby.
 You just told me
you kissed him.
 Five years ago, it was nothing.
 Come on, baby.
 I've been there
for four years.
 I really like it,
I have all my friends there.
 It pays well, I have
health care-- michael...
 Babe...
I don't want
to start over.
 You know how much
I don't want to start over.
 I can't help it--
it makes me uncomfortable.
 There are a million other
hotels in south beach.
 Just find another one.
 (knocking on door)
 Janie?
 Did you forget your key?
 What are you doing here?
 Didn't you get my text?
 Oh, no, no. I didn't.
 I have too many phones.
 If it's important, the best way
to reach me is through twitter.
 Actually, today isn't
a good day anymore.
 Jane seemed off
after her sonogram,
 That's what I was
texting you about.
 (car approaching)
 Oh, shoot! She's coming.
 Jane? Now?
 How's my hair?
 Come on, get in here quick.
 What kind of mother are you to
keep a father from his daughter?
 She's going through a hard time,
she had her f...
 And I have been patient
long enough.
 Tell her now, or I will.
 Okay, just-- stay here.
 Honey...
 I wanted to talk with you.
 Oh, hang on, I'm gonna just
finish filling something out.
 A job application?
 You like your job.
 Yeah, michael wants me to quit.
 He's uncomfortable with rafael.
 Which I get.
 Plus, the whole sonogram was
kind of hard for him, so...
 And how about you?
 Oh, honey...
 We...
 We heard the heartbeat, mom.
 And I just started
to think about it.
 I just didn't want this
to take over my life
 And change everything.
 I know, baby. I know.
 But it's going to.
Oh...
 'cause it's not a stupid
milkshake, it's a baby,
 And I'm gonna
get attached to it.
 I mean, how can I not?
 And then I have
to give it to them.
 And that's what I want to do.
 I do, but it's gonna be so hard.
 I mean, it just is.
 Even if rafael
and petra are great.
 And I don't know how to prepare,
or how to act,
 Or what to do
to not make it hurt.
 Honey, I don't think
there's anything you can do.
 See this? This right here
is why I keep saying to sue.
 Because you're gonna
have a lot of pain.
 All because of
this frickin' doctor.
 And your life is now hard
and complicated
 In ways it shouldn't be.
 Mom, don't you cry.
 I'm not.
 I mean, me? I...
 I'm a screw-up.
 I mean, I deserved to get
knocked up, but you?
 This isn't fair.
 Stop, we can't go to that
"it's not fair" place.
 We won't go there, then.
 Yeah.
We can go
 To the "it sucks" place, right?
 Yeah, I think that's
where I'm at right now.
 It sucks. All around.
 Yeah, it does.
 But it's gonna suck
worse for you.
 And you got to remember that.
 That supposed
to make me feel better?
 I'm just saying--
 You get to be selfish now.
 You don't have to take care
of anyone else, just yourself.
 Okay?
 Yeah. Thanks.
 You know, you're
not a screw-up, mom.
 I mean, the way you chase
your singing dream.
 That's some brave stuff.
 I could use some
of that right now.
 I guess it...
 I guess it's just hitting me
that I'm having a baby.
 And how much it
totally sucks.
 In a way that doesn't offend god
 And whatever higher plan
he has for us.
 Bueno.
 Where does that expression
come from, anyway?
 You know, I really,
I can't even remember.
 Abuela...
 Mom.
 I'm sorry, okay?
 Don't be upset about that.
 Latin lover narrator: But
xiomara was not upset at all.
 Because she remembered
the events
 Of the quinceaÃ±era
quite differently.
 Here's jane's superfly date.
 And here is jane's superfly
date's superslutty hookup.
 â™ª my milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard â™ª
 â™ª and damn right...
 Latin lover narrator:
And the memory
 That she was a good mom,
 That she knew when to protect
her daughter's feelings,
 Fortified xiomara.
 I want to see her right now.
 No, you won't, because
being a parent means
 That you put
your kid's interest first,
 And right now,
jane's overwhelmed,
 And she needs some part
of her life to not change,
 And so you're gonna back off
until I tell you she's ready.
 And don't ever question me
as a mother again, got it?
 Okay.
 I will wait.
 But not forever, right?
 No.
 Not forever.
 Her eyes are so
bright and curious.
 Much like my own.
 Tell me, is she
a singer like you?
 What?
 Nothing, I-I'm just...
 I'm surprised you remembered.
 Your voice, xiomara--
 Unforgettable.
 Yeah, well...
 I know I'll have to give up
trying at some point.
 Why?
 I became an international
star just a few years ago.
 Imagine what a disservice it
would have been to the world,
 If I had given up.
 Michael, it's me.
 I thought I could treat this
pregnancy like it was nothing,
 Like an inconvenience.
 But I can't,
and I can't pretend
 That nothing's changed because
everything's changed.
 Everything's different now.
 I'm gonna be different,
 After going through this,
 After carrying a baby,
 And having to give it up.
 So, I need some constants in my
life right now, I really do.
 Which is why I'm
gonna keep my job.
 And I love you, michael,
and I don't want to hurt you,
 But I get to be selfish now.
 Not you.
 (sighs deeply)
 I love you,
and you love me.
 It's over, roman.
 Let go of me.
 (grunts)
what...?
 (grunts)
 (panting)
 Good.
 You passed the test.
 I wanted to make sure
 You'd fight for me.
 Damn right I'd fight for you.
 Wha...?
 Mmm! The party.
 I have to get ready.
 We'll sneak away later?
 I'll see you later.
 Uh-huh.
Mmm...
 (gentle laugh)
 (sighs heavily)
 Latin lover narrator:
But there would be no later.
 Not for them.
 â™ª
 Your father is going to
love the renovations.
 He'll be so impressed
with what you've done.
 They got the marlin
right, finally.
 Can you imagine
if he showed up
 To an ice sculpture
of a wizard?
 (laughs)
 You know what?
I am so sick of this.
 Maybe you're right.
 Maybe this can't be salvaged.
 But I can't take this.
 You standing there,
all sanctimonious.
 Uh-huh...
Yes, I did something terrible.
 But you know what?
You did something
terrible, too!
 And what did I do?
 What did I do?
 Tell me.
 You stopped loving me.
 I remember the day, actually.
 I'm sure it started
happening earlier.
 I'm sure I just registered it
on this day, but...
 You were halfway
through your chemo.
 And it seemed like you
had a nice enough visit
 From your sister, but after
she left, you came out,
 And you were looking
around and...
 And when you looked at me...
 (quiet sigh)
 ...It felt as if
everything had changed.
 But I honestly hoped
 That this baby would be
 A real chance for us.
 Because you might've
stopped loving me.
 But I never stopped loving you.
 Latin lover narrator:
Turns out, it's easy
to give a good performance...
 When what you are saying
is actually true.
 (romantic music playing nearby)
 Can I come in?
 What's with the music?
 Well, I wanted
to do something for you.
 Like some big
telenovela gesture.
 Fill the whole
room with flowers
 Or leopards or something.
 But there are
budget restrictions.
 So...
 When the guy comes to the
girl to say he screwed up,
 There's always this dramatic
I-screwed-up music.
 So this is my dramatic
I-screwed-up music.
 I listened to your message.
 And you're right.
 I made this about
me and not you.
 Of course you should
keep your job.
 You should do whatever
you need to do.
 (quiet laugh)
 I'm really sorry.
 Wait. That...
 That thing you said about
everything changing?
 That's not fair.
 How much I love you?
 That is not changing.
 You got some good music
to kiss to in there?
 Oh, yeah.
 I got the best music to kiss to.
 I wanted to give you this.
 Divorce papers I assume.
 It's the sonogram
of the baby.
 Look, we've both made mistakes.
 And I don't know
if we'll get past them.
 Let's give it a try.
 Well, you can't
blame me for being
 A little jealous though, right?
I mean, the guy's like...
 Well, let's put it this way,
your mom was drooling over him.
 First of all,
my mom drools over everybody.
 And second?
So not my type.
 Way too pretty, right?
I mean... Just super pretty.
 Super pretty.
(laughs): Super.
 Hey.
 Trust me.
 You have nothing
to be jealous of.
 Just be happy for me.
 I love him, mother.
 I actually think
we can fix this.
 But what about the other man
you whored yourself to?
 You are a selfish girl.
 After I sacrificed
everything for you?
 Stop, mother.
 I'll figure it out.
(gasps)
 Oh, enough with
the tarot cards already!
 (laughs)
oh, don't be dramatic.
 I'm playing solitaire.
 I already
read the cards.
 I already know this outcome.
 Would you go
back to your room, please?
 Shouldn't you be in there?
 Yeah, just kind of taking
a moment, pre-game.
 Understood.
 So, you should know...
 I'm gonna sue your sister.
 I went back and forth,
but she screwed up.
 And she needs to permanently
lose her license
 And admit her
wrongdoings and...
 You should sue.
 And don't worry, it's got
nothing to do with me.
 Latin lover narrator:
Except that his hotel
was on the line.
 I'm glad you understand.
 I also...
 I wanted to thank you.
 What you said before about
 Not avoiding something,
due to fear...
 I needed to hear it.
 Are you gonna start writing?
 Hey, if that's
what I want to do,
 I gotta go for it, right?
 Like you, like my mom...
 Like your mom?
 Yeah, you know, it's funny
that you mention her.
 Did I mention her?
 Not really the point.
She's a singer.
 (laughs)
and she's really good,
 And she just has never
really gotten her big break,
 And she said that
there was gonna be
 A huge producer in
your hotel next month...
 You want an introduction?
 I want her to perform here.
 I'm trying to look
 At the bright side,
like you said.
 Of course.
 Cool.
 I should probably get to work.
 Yeah.
 I'll... I'll walk with you.
 (low, indistinct conversations)
 Rafael:
I am so sorry.
 I'll tell her
to leave right now.
 What are you doing here?
 I invited her.
 Dad. I don't know if you know
what's been going on here...
 Of course I know.
 Your sister made a very
unfortunate mistake.
 But she wasn't drinking
and that's important.
 An "unfortunate mistake"?
 Dad, I don't understand
why you coddle her...
 That's not true.
 You do understand.
 Luisa is family.
 And family is everything.
 And speaking of...
 Hello, darling.
 Luisa.
 Xiomara! Xiomara!
 Ooh, mommy!
 Â¿el presidente?
 You could actually
get really rich from this.
 You do realize that.
 I'm not doing this
to get rich.
 I mean, I can handle rich.
 Rich wouldn't be the
worst thing in the world.
 Okay, in the meantime,
 We've got some ideas.
 Changes we'd like
to see at the hotel.
 Since it seems like
you kind of have pull.
 Let me hear them.
 I'm all about embracing change.
 (partygoers groaning)
 (thud, squish)
 (woman screams)
 Man:
Zaz!
 Latin lover narrator:
On the bright side, jane's
quinceaÃ±era was no longer
 The worst party
she'd ever been to.
