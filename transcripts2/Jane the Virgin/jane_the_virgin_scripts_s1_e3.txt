 Latin lover narrator:
Ah, there you are again.
Before we begin, a refresher:
 Jane's grandmother
raised her to believe
 That her virginity was sacred,
that she should wait.
 This is jane's fiancÃ©, michael.
 Their life was perfectly
on track until...
 There you are, doctor.
 You have an insemination
 In seven and a pap in eight.
 Luisa:
Yeah, an insemination
 And a pap, yeah, I got it.
 Latin lover narrator:
She does not "got it."
 Are you ready
for your insemination?
 Hi. Yes.
 I artificially inseminated
the wrong woman.
 Latin lover narrator:
And the father, rafael,
 Is married to petra.
 Unfortunately, petra was
boning his best friend.
 And michael knows this,
because he's a detective.
 But that problem kind of
took care of itself.
 Yep, that happened.
 Roman zazo died.
 Meanwhile...
This is jane's father,
 International telenovela star
 Rogelio de la vega,
 Who her mother is currently
hooking up with.
 But jane doesn't know
he's her father... Yet.
 And now you are caught up.
 â™ª
 On the 27th of October,
 Way, way back in the year 2000,
 Young jane gloriana villanueva
 Caught a firefly in her hands.
 And so she made
a very important wish.
 Actually, two.
 And when she was 16,
 Both of those wishes
 Were finally coming true.
 That is, until...
 Jane:
Just so you know,
 I'm gonna save myself.
 Until marriage.
 (lyrical song playing)
I can't believe
he dumped me.
 Maybe next time...
Just don't tell him
 About the whole
virgin-until-marriage-thing.
 Xiomara!
 Relax.
 I don't mean
"have sex."
 I just mean put off
the conversation,
 Let him think you
like to take it slow.
 Really, ma?
"big balls of evil"?
 But how will I know when
I've met the right man?
 And that little tingly
feeling between your legs.
 Latin lover narrator:
And so, that night,
 As xo's favorite
breakup song played,
 Jane made a final wish.
 That she'd meet
the perfect guy,
 The one who would wait,
 And she'd know-- deep inside--
 It was right.
 (knocking at door)
 Jane:
Ma!
Shh, shh, shh.
 Mom, I need my wedges.
 Which I told you
not to borrow.
 Hang on, honey, one minute!
 This is a great moment.
Let's tell her
 That I'm her father right now.
Shh, shh.
 Why are you
up, honey?
 It's only 6:00.
 You're not on
breakfast on mondays.
Yeah.
 I switched with frankie
so that I could
 Have coffee with petra later.
 I want to get
to know her a little.
 Mama!
I need my shoes!
 Come on!
 Why is this even locked?
 No reason, honey.
 Here you go.
Thanks. Ma?
 Is everything okay?
 Alba:
Jane!
 Now?
Mm-hmm.
 Rogelio:
My daughter is getting married?
 No, wait, I'm on
tour in the fall.
 We'll need her to work
around some dates...
 Psst.
 Ooh...
 Yeah, I think...
 I think these arepas
are plenty spicy.
 Mm-mm. I have to go
to work now...
 Abuela?
Huh?
 Are you okay?
 Then again, we both ended up
unmarried and pregnant, so
 You must have really pissed
the big man off.
 (gasps)
 I'm sorry, honey,
 I didn't mean it
as an insult to you,
 Just as an insult to her.
 Latin lover narrator:
But jane wasn't
insulted at all.
 In fact, she'd just had
an epiphany.
 My whole life,
I didn't want to end up
 An unmarried pregnant woman
like my mom.
 But guess what.
 I'm an unmarried pregnant woman
like my mom.
 The big bad thing, the thing
I was most afraid of...
 It happened.
 But I'm engaged
to the man that I love
 And I'm going to spend
the rest of my life with.
 I waited for you.
 And now that I'm pregnant,
 Why should I wait another year,
 Another week,
another minute, even?
 Jane... What are you saying?
 Let's have sex.
 (angelic choir singing)
 Oh...
 Are you nervous?
 Don't be nervous.
 That's easy for you to say.
 It'll be quick,
I promise.
 In and out.
 Will you come with me?
 That's not really
appropriate.
 Just tell them everything
you saw, okay?
 Last night, before
roman zazo fell.
 You never know
what's important
 At the beginning
of an investigation.
 No detail's
too small.
 We're looking for the
tiniest inconsistencies.
 What?
 Nothing.
 I just... Find it kind of sexy
 When you talk all... Cop.
 Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
 I've got a 15-minute
break coming up.
 The seats in my car lean
all the way back...
 I'm not having sex
with you for the first time
 In the backseat of your car.
 I was totally
kidding.
Mm-hmm.
 Female officer:
Jane? Your turn.
 You ready?
Mm-hmm.
 Okay.
 Honey, stop reading
 Those articles.
 They're just speculating
 And you're torturing
yourself.
 I know. I know.
 Did you know that my dad
wants me to cancel the memorial
 And issue a statement
distancing the hotel from zaz?
 Well, are you going to do it?
 What choice
do I have?
 He's the majority owner.
 Whatever.
I gotta find zaz's brother
 And tell him what happened.
 Yeah?
I don't even know
where to find him, though,
 'cause zaz hadn't talked
to the guy in ten years.
 Latin lover narrator:
Trust me,
 She definitely knew.
 But I really didn't know zaz.
 Latin lover narrator:
Trust me,
 She definitely did.
 â™ª
 My necklace...
 I, uh...
 I had a-a necklace
 I wanted to wear tonight.
 I'm sorry.
 I think I'm just focusing
on these silly, mundane things
 Because I'm just...
 (sighs)
 I'm just in shock.
 Latin lover narrator:
This was absolutely true.
 Petra was in shock.
 And she knew exactly
what she needed to do.
 Nadine:
We interviewed the employees,
 And nobody saw anything
suspicious.
 It was clearly
a crime of passion.
 Which is why we need to bring
petra solano in for questioning.
 No way. No. No.
 Roman zazo was an associate
of sin rostro...
 Latin lover narrator:
Think of sin rostro as
"the big bad wolf."
 We're the closest we've been
to this guy in four years.
 If we bring
petra in now,
 Her lawyer's gonna
start asking questions,
 It's gonna expose the
whole investigation.
 No signs of
struggle.
 It was someone
he knew.
 Sir, she's not strong enough
 To push him through a window.
 What-what about
the unregistered gun?
 What...? It wasn't used,
it wasn't even out.
 And whoever it was
was having drinks with him.
 Two glasses
were found...
One without fingerprints.
 Because petra wiped
it down...
Why would she
wipe down a glass
 When she knows her prints
are all over that apartment?
 So, her husband found out
and he did it.
 We have no
evidence he knew.
 Which is why we need
to bring her in
 And ask some questions...
All right, enough.
I need to think.
 Latin lover narrator:
Fyi...
 Everything michael said?
 Absolutely true.
 And yet he is absolutely lying
about the real reason
 He needed to keep
petra's affair under wraps.
 See, he had made
some calculations...
 ...Which would leave him...
 If sin rostro
took out zaz
 And he doesn't know
we're onto him...
 Well, we've got a real shot
 At the big bad wolf.
 But one piece
of evidence
 Comes to light
against petra,
 We're bringing her in.
 (phone chimes)
 (elevator dings)
 Hey.
Hi.
 Did you know the guy?
Who, uh...
 Roman zazo.
 Yeah.
 He was,
he was my, um...
 College roommate.
 Latin lover narrator:
And maybe it was
the look in his eyes,
 But jane felt compelled
to touch rafael's arm.
 (heart pounding quickly)
 Anyway...
 If you need anything,
I'm around.
 Lina:
You little liar!
 You never told me
you were going to have sex!
 Michael seems
like a crier.
 What? No.
 He's not a crier.
 Oh, please, he's so
totally in love with you,
 It's all been pent up.
 There's a good chance
he cries on release.
 Where are you
going, his place?
 No, michael's brother--
 Who he cannot stand--
is crashing there.
 My first time was
in a tanning bed.
 Ew.
Ew.
Ew.
 She does not want
a tanning bed.
 She's gonna want it all
fairy tale telenovela.
 That is not true.
 I just want it somewhere
between fairy tale telenovela
 And the backseat of a car.
 You should take one of
those 11th-floor suites.
 The cops closed the whole floor.
 Luca:
Those are nice.
 So, are you nervous?
 Nervous? No.
 Yes.
Yeah, maybe a little bit.
 Mm-hmm.
Well, it's just...
 It's such a big deal.
 And I want it to be good.
 You know? For me.
For him...
 Yeah, I changed
my mind.
 You're both
gonna cry.
(laughs)
 I'll take table eight.
 Hey, guys.
 Can I get you
something to drink?
 Oh, hi.
 Rose, dad...
 This is jane.
 The girl I accidentally
impregnated who's suing me.
 Hello.
 Can we get
 Three waters, please?
 Maybe I should get someone else.
 Great idea.
Good idea, yeah.
Great idea.
 Well, that is one way to meet
 The mother of
your grandchild.
 I'm going to leave you both.
 Thanks for helping my daughter
with her legal woes.
 Luisa
can be
 A bit of a handful.
 What are you doing?
 Leave him.
What?
 Let's go somewhere.
 Together.
 You don't love him.
 What happened yesterday
was a mistake.
 It's not gonna happen again.
 Latin lover narrator:
Meanwhile, jane was
trying to put luisa
 Far from her mind.
 Armed with a key
 To the 11th floor suites,
 She concentrated
on what lay ahead.
 Specifically
getting laid ahead.
 Because the truth is
 Jane did want
the perfect fairy tale
 Telenovela experience
for her first time.
 Then again,
perfect doesn't exist.
 Especially in telenovelas.
 Suddenly, jane saw petra
lurking at the crime scene.
 Petra popping pills.
 And then...
 Her fiancÃ©.
 What took you so long?
 We're not talking here.
 Latin lover narrator:
You will recall we last left
jane witnessing something
 That left her
more than mildly unsettled.
 You don't go to the crime scene.
You didn't answer my text.
 I was with my boss,
trying to keep you out of jail.
 They're looking
for any reason to bring you in.
 I left the necklace in there.
What?!
 When I went to end it,
things got a little...
 Violent.
 You have to go get it.
 Please?
 Where were you last night
when zaz was killed?
 What?
 You heard me.
Where were you?
 I was in our suite.
 Look, I'm guilty
of having an affair.
 That's all!
 I love my husband.
 If he finds out, he'll leave me.
 Jane? Hello.
 Hi. Hey.
 What are you guys up to?
 Are you okay, honey?
Mm-hmm.
 I was just talking
to your fiancÃ©
 About hotel security.
You know,
 After what happened.
Of course.
 Thank you. Uh, we're
still on for coffee later,
 I hope.
Yeah, yeah. Looking
forward to it.
 Great, good.
Uh-huh.
 So, what was that all about?
What?
 Well, I was upstairs, trying
to get us a room for tonight.
 And...
You got us a room?
 Yes, but listen.
I saw petra
 Outside the crime scene
and then I saw you
 Meet her up there.
 So, what were you guys
really talking about?
 Latin lover narrator:
Part of michael wanted
to tell jane
 Everything
right then and there,
 Not go any deeper,
not let this thing snowball...
 We were talking
about hotel security.
 That's it.
 ...But instead he lied.
 Well, I think that you
need to talk to her again
 Because I saw her lurking
outside the crime scene
 Before you got there.
 "lurking"?
Okay, you officially
 Watch too many telenovelas.
 Michael, I'm saying "lurking"
because she was lurking.
 She's standing there
in front of the door.
 She wanted to go in.
 She changed her mind.
 She started to shake.
 And then she took a pill!
 Trust me.
 Something is off!
 Her friend was killed.
She's upset.
 What's going on with you?
 Nothing.
Then why are you dismissing me?
 I'm dismissing you 'cause
you're not making any sense.
 You're, like,
hormonal or something.
 I-I...
Mm-hmm.
 Jane?
 (sighs)
 Mm.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Are you done with work?
 No. No, I had a break.
 I had this really strong urge...
 Actually "urge" is
not the right word.
 I had a need.
 I needed a croquetta.
 I guess it's a pregnancy
craving or something.
 I would offer you some,
 But I'm really enjoying it
and if I give you a bite,
 I may resent you in
a very serious way.
 Okay.
(quiet laugh)
 So...
 Petra?
 How is she doing?
 Uh, it must be
really hard for her.
 Actually, she's been...
Really strong.
 Good. I'm so glad.
 Because if she was struggling,
I would understand.
 No, yeah, no. I...
 You'd think she would be.
 But she's, she's...
 Been incredible.
 (seagull caws)
 So, how are you?
 Uh...
 Is that, is that weird?
 I mean, am I allowed
to ask you that?
 I think it's all weird,
don't you think?
 Yeah.
Yeah.
 But, yeah.
 I'm adjusting.
 What's that?
 Oh, it's a... Press release.
 Wait, you're a writer.
 Can you help me with this?
You're the only one
 That calls me a writer.
Do you know that?
 Well, are you writing?
 Good. So...
 I have to issue a statement
about what happened last night.
 And I don't know, maybe...
 Is there a way to allude
to the same thing
 But make it seem
a little, uh...
 Nicer?
 Uh...
 Say "that your
college roommate
 "was a troubled young man
who you and the hotel
 Have nothing to
do with" nicer?
 My dad's trying to protect
the hotel's reputation.
 What?
 Nothing.
 (sighs)
I'm sorry.
 I'm judgey.
 You should know that about me.
 You may end up having
a really judgey kid.
 Okay, so what does
"judgey" sound like?
 So that I can be prepared.
 You told me that you don't want
to be anything like your dad,
 Which is easy enough to say.
 But actions are what count.
 So, what are you doing about it?
 I hope the baby's judgey.
 Latin lover narrator:
But it happened again.
 That quickening
in jane's heart.
 Or maybe it was just
the pregnancy hormones
 And not her heart at all.
 I should get back to work.
 Uh, good to see you.
 Uh, uh, okay.
 (doorbell rings)
 Hi.
 Some kind of gift
from rogelio, it looks like.
 I'm telling you, ma, it was
like electric between us!
 Oh.
 His headshot.
 Well, that's nice to have.
 His signature
super spicy salad dressing.
 It's some kind of
prepackaged gift.
 Bueno...
 Whatever.
He's a jerk.
 I know, ma.
And I was going to.
 But with the pregnancy,
 I just don't want
to overwhelm her right now.
 Ma, relax.
 He agreed to stay away from her.
 Hi. I would like your biggest,
 Most grandest room, please.
 I couldn't ask rafael.
He just kept going on and on
 About how great his marriage is.
 Rogelio de la vega.
 De la vega.
 Rogelio de la vega.
 Maybe I am hormonal.
 Maybe she took that pill
because she had a headache.
 Yeah, and maybe you picked
a fight with michael
 Because you're still
afraid to have sex.
 First of all,
I'm not afraid to have sex.
 I've never been
afraid to have sex!
 And I didn't pick
a fight with him.
 There was something
off with petra.
 My gut is telling me.
 Oh, sure.
 Who should I make it out to?
 Oh, it's the, oh, it's...
Oh. Yes.
 Maybe she's got a pill problem
and zaz was her dealer.
 He was doing something bad.
 I heard they found
a gun in his room.
 What? Are you serious?
 Carmen from dry
cleaning saw the cops
 Carrying it out of the room
 In one of those
little baggies.
 What if petra has
a real drug problem?
 Okay, here's what you do.
 You need to find a way
to get petra's urine
 So you can test it.
 Okay, really?
That's your solution?
 Desperate times,
desperate measures.
 Latin lover narrator:
Desperate times,
desperate measures indeed.
 Which is why
 Michael was about to commit
 A federal offense.
 Rafael:
Michael?
 Hi. Rafael?
 The father of the...
Yes, I know.
 Right. Hi.
 Look, uh, you
shouldn't be here.
 This is an active crime scene.
Don't want anyone
 Tampering with the evidence.
 Okay. Well, I'd like to speak
 With the lead detective then.
 That would be me.
How can I help you?
 (quiet laugh)
 Why don't we start
with you telling me
 What you think happened here.
 I'm sorry. I can't
discuss the details
 Of an open investigation.
The press is all over this!
 I got to tell them something.
 The press is not my problem.
 Well, I have a right to know
 What's happening in my hotel!
 My crime scene
trumps your hotel.
 Don't take it personally.
 He's frustrated.
 We don't have a lot
of information yet.
 But, uh, between us?
 We are working on
a few different theories.
 Accident, murder.
 Maybe crime of passion?
 Did you know his girlfriend?
 (chuckles)
zaz didn't have a girlfriend.
 That you know of.
 Thank you for covering for me.
 I'll be right back.
You got it.
 Excuse me, miss?
 Mm-hmm.
 (quietly):
Oh, my god.
 I know.
 (laughing):
Oh, my god!
 It is indeed me.
 (short breaths)
 No, no, no, please, please.
 Breathe, just, you know...
 Inhala.
 Exhala.
 Inhala.
 Exhala.
 It-it happens all the time.
 It is very hard
for normal people
 Like you...
 To believe it
when they see me in person.
 Oh!
 You know what?
 This is really embarrassing,
but I am gonna
 Hate myself after
if I don't ask you.
 Can I get a selfie?
 Oh, yes.
I will love that very much.
 Latin lover narrator:
Even though rogelio
knew he could
 Get in trouble with xiomara,
he could not resist
 Taking a picture
with his daughter.
 Silly phone. Okay.
 Oh, I was just...
It's not on.
 Okay.
 Xiomara (gasps):
Look.
 Okay. Okay.
 He-he couldn't
have told her.
 She wouldn't have
snapped a selfie.
 Wait. Stop.
To say what exactly?
 (doorbell rings)
 Jane:
Hello?
 Latin lover narrator:
Please note, this was not
 The sort of thing
jane usually did.
 Anybody home?
And in the event
 Someone answered, she had
an excuse clearly planned out.
 Hello?
 Latin lover narrator:
But no one did answer.
 Huh.
 (gasps)
 Aah!
 Latin lover narrator:
Okay, good news.
 While petra is washing off
that ridiculous mask,
 Jane is concocting something
relatively believable.
 Well, I knew we were
meeting up for coffee later.
 I just didn't know it would
be in my dressing room.
 There's only one problem.
 I saw you earlier
outside the crime scene,
 And something seemed off,
 And then you took
some sort of pill,
 So I checked your bathroom
and then your dressing room.
 In case you had
a problem.
 Well, you were right.
 I did take a pill.
 A xanax.
 I got a prescription
two years ago
 After I found out my
husband had cancer.
 I've taken three.
 One after he
was diagnosed,
 One when he had an
eight-hour surgery and...
 One today,
 After his best friend was
murdered in our hotel.
 God. Of course.
 I'm so sorry.
 Don't be.
 You're giving a baby
away to strangers.
 Of course you're gonna
want to check up on us.
 Let me show you something.
 Well, I wanted to put the crib
closer to the window
 So the baby could see
the ocean,
 But then I read
that could be dangerous,
 Because window cords
could be a choking hazard.
 Oh, my god.
 I can't believe
I'm crying right now.
 I'm officially hormonal.
 It's beautiful.
 â™ª
 (weakly):
Uh...
 Inhale. Exhale.
 (inhales deeply)
inhale.
 (exhales)
exhale.
 (chuckles)
 Ah.
 ...Porque...
 Â¿sÃ­?
 â™ª
 What happened?
 He snowed you, ma.
He's an actor.
 No. It's too much
for her to handle right now.
 The keycard log places petra
up in her penthouse,
 Exactly where she said she was
during the murder.
 Still think
she's guilty?
 (knock at door)
 Sorry. I-I know
you're working.
 It's just, I was up
in petra's penthouse, and...
 (stammers)
can I talk to you?
 Sure.
 So, apparently, I am hormonal
 Because I snuck up
into petra's suite,
 And you were right
and I was wrong.
 You snuck into
her suite?
 Yeah. I know. I know...
 I just... I'm sorry
 That I was freaking out
on you before.
 I was just so sure that
there was something going on,
 But I was wrong,
and she's lovely.
 And I promise I wasn't
swayed by the fact
 That she gave us the
presidential suite for tonight.
 You told her
about tonight?
 No, not that... Not that it
was our first time.
 Just that we needed
some time to ourselves.
 Anyway, I'm sorry
about before.
 I really am.
 Let me make it up
to you tonight.
 Good. Good.
 Okay, I'll meet you at 8:00.
 And I'll come straight
from church.
 Y-you're going to church first?
 Yeah. My grandma called,
 And she insisted
for some reason.
 Don't worry. I'm not gonna
tell her, obviously.
 Priest:
God is faithful.
 He will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear.
 And when we are tempted,
 He will provide a way out
so that we can endure.
 Mom! Shh.
 I'm trying to listen
to the priest.
 Priest:
God will deliver us from sin
 If we choose to follow him.
 Will you follow god,
or will you choose instead
 To continue to lie
to your abuela?
 Yes, jane, I am talking to you.
 Abuela taught you
that a lie by omission
 Is still a lie.
 â™ª tonight's the night
you'll lie in bed â™ª
 â™ª you should tell the truth
 â™ª but you'll lie instead
 â™ª don't have sex, jane
 â™ª don't have sex
 â™ª can you really lie
to my face? â™ª
 Choir:
â™ª can you really lie
 â™ª to her face?
 â™ª virginity for you and me
 â™ª if you keep your legs closed
 â™ª keep them closed
 â™ª keep them closed...
 I'm gonna have sex
with michael tonight.
 Hallelujah!
 Come on. Relax, ma.
 They're practically
married already.
 Abuela, you can't forbid it.
 I told you because I didn't
feel right not telling you.
 I wasn't asking for permission.
 And things changed.
 I'm pregnant and a virgin.
 And I'm... I just don't
think god will forsake me.
 I'm sorry, I just don't.
 I have to go.
 I'm sorry
I disappointed you, abuela.
 Honey?
 Did you wax?
 Clean everything up
down there?
 (sighs)
I love you.
 (singing in spanish)
 (continues singing in spanish)
 This is...
 Some memorial.
 Trust me.
It's very zaz.
 How'd you get your
dad to agree?
 I thought that he wanted
to distance the hotel.
 Because he didn't
want bad press.
 Oh.
 But then he realized
he'd get even worse press
 If word got out
that he forbid his own son
 From throwing a memorial
for his college roommate.
 Nice work.
Thank you.
 (song ends, crowd applauds)
 (romantic ballad begins)
 What?
 I just...
 I love this song.
 Latin lover narrator:
And maybe it was the music,
 Or the moment,
or the vodka cranberry
 He had downed too quickly,
 But suddenly rafael
was extending his hand.
 Dance with me.
 What? No.
 What? You just said
you love this song.
 No.
 Dance with me.
 Mmm...
 (song continues in spanish)
 (jane chuckles)
 Thank you.
 I have to...
 I'm gonna go meet with michael,
so... I, um...
 I'll see you later.
 Latin lover narrator:
Jane told herself
 Her heart could be racing
for any number of reasons--
 Hormones, nerves,
alba's spicy chicken arepas.
 What was happening was nothing.
 This was who she wanted.
 Wow.
 You look...
 So do you.
 Dance with me?
 Oh, no, no dancing.
 It's okay.
 You're sweating.
 Are you nervous?
 No.
 M-maybe a little.
 (whispering): Are you sure
you want to do this?
 Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
 (both moaning)
 Rafael:
Thank you for coming.
 If it's your first time,
 We hope it's an experience
you never forget.
 Oh.
 Oh, my god.
 Let us fulfill your every need.
 Oh, here.
 (louder):
I'm rafael solano...
 Turn that off,
actually.
 Okay, I'm trying!
 ...And your pleasure
I...
 Is my pleasure.
What if I...?
 I'm...
This is off.
 It doesn't...
I got it.
 There it is.
 (sighs)
 (laughs nervously)
 I guess...
 Oh, my god.
 I did not expect you to call.
 I can't stay
away from you.
 I try,
 But I can't.
 But, lu, now this
is important.
 Mmm.
 I'm not gonna
leave him.
 And you-- I need you
to understand that.
 This is just
a temporary thing.
 Okay, well, then, let's...
 Let's just enjoy it
while it lasts.
 Mmm. Do you remember
what we got that first time
 That we were together in that,
 In that motel
in fort lauderdale?
 (laughs)
 Powdered doughnuts
from the vending machine.
 Go (laughs) get them.
 Mmm.
 (sighs)
 (whistles)
 Baby, are you okay?
 Are you sure you
want to do this?
 I want to.
 I do want to.
 You do?
 Yeah.
Okay.
 Okay.
 (fire alarm sounds)
 Darling?
 What's going on?
 We should probably evacuate.
 It's probably
just a drill.
 Woman:
This is not a drill.
 Please evacuate
into the hotel lobby.
 Come on, hurry!
 Think your grandma put in
a call to the big guy?
 Latin lover narrator:
And the truth was,
 Jane couldn't be sure
it wasn't divine intervention.
 Because suddenly, she was
confused about everything.
 I should probably
check it out.
 Of course.
Yeah, go, go.
 Rafael:
Excuse me.
 It'll just be a few minutes.
 Thanks.
 I just saw my sister.
 And I know I need
to forgive her, but I can't.
 And it's not the mistake,
it's the fact that she lied.
 Hey, did you ever get
in touch with aaron?
 Aaron?
 Zaz's brother.
 You mentioned him this morning.
 Latin lover narrator: He had not
got in touch with aaron.
 In fact, rafael's search for
zaz's brother had been stymied
 By one simple fact.
 Until this moment,
he never knew his name.
 I didn't even know
he had a brother.
 No.
 Not yet.
 You know, the cops think
that he was seeing someone.
 Zaz?
 Yeah.
 I had no idea.
 It makes me feel like
I didn't really know him.
 Anyways...
 I guess we'll find out
who it was.
 So, can we talk?
 'cause upstairs,
 Besides the fire alarm
and the tv thing,
 Something seemed off.
 Yeah, you're right.
 Latin lover narrator:
Jane thought about
what her abuela said,
 How lies spiral.
 What is it?
 Really, what could jane say?
 She was having feelings
for another man?
 But what if
it was just hormones,
 The result of a suddenly
untrustworthy gut?
 It was my grandma.
 She was so upset about this,
and I tried to push past it,
 But, um...
 It's, it's okay.
 It's okay.
 I-I... I understand.
 We'll wait, then.
 But what are we waiting for?
 I-I love you.
 You're the person
I want to be with.
 So...
 There's no reason why we can't
move the wedding up, right?
 (cell phone rings)
 Nadine, is this
important?
 What?
 You lied to me.
 We have proof your mother's
keycard was used
 To access a back stairwell five
minutes before the murder.
 A stairwell without cameras.
 And your mother,
who is in a wheelchair,
 Obviously didn't climb
those stairs.
 Look, I'm telling you,
I didn't kill him.
 Then why were you
in the stairwell?
 I can't say.
 You could go to jail.
 Then I'll tell them you tampered
with the crime scene.
 I won't go to
jail, but you will.
 And, of course,
you'd lose jane.
 So, I'd figure out a way
out of this if I were you.
 I'm proud of you, mom.
 Calling jane like that,
I know it wasn't easy.
 I wonder if she already...
 It's stupid.
 I barely even
know the guy.
 Part of me thought maybe
for a second with jane's father,
 I'd get
the fairy tale, too.
 Whatever.
 These pistachios suck.
 "always and forever, xo."
 Latin lover narrator:
Huh.
 Maybe she'll get
her fairy tale after all.
 I didn't have sex, abuela.
 What happened?
 We decided to wait
until we were married.
 Which is gonna be next week.
 (gasps, shouts)
(laughs)
 Latin lover narrator: And that
night jane made a final wish.
 That she would go to bed
 And wake up without feelings
for rafael.
 No fireflies were hurt
in the making of this episode.
