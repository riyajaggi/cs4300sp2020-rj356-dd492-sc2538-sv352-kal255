 Latin lover narrator:
All right, here we go.
As you know,
 Jane was accidentally
artificially inseminated.
But I've never had sex.
 Needless to say,
her fiancÃ© was not pleased.
 Please, for us,
don't have this baby.
 But jane decided
to have the baby.
 And we're giving it
to the father.
 He and his wife--
they really want it.
 And they're a really
great couple.
 Latin lover narrator:
They weren't.
 In fact, michael realized
 Petra was having an affair
with roman zazo,
 Her husband's best friend.
 End the affair, or
I'll tell your husband.
 And jane's not giving
that baby to him alone.
 But that problem
took care of itself.
 And unfortunately, rafael found
out about the affair anyway.
 We're done, petra.
 And michael finally
 Got on board
with keeping the baby.
 It's not just some other guy's
baby, it's yours, too.
 And if you want it, I am all in.
 Luckily, she didn't want it.
 And, speaking of complications,
 Jane has just learned
that her dad is
 Telenovela star
rogelio de la vega.
 I'm your father.
 All this time...
 You knew who my father was,
 And you didn't tell me?
 Latin lover narrator:
And now we'll begin.
 As we all know by now,
 When jane gloriana villanueva
came into this world,
 Her father was already
out of the picture.
 And though
she sometimes fantasized
 About who her father was
 And what having two parents
would be like...
 Hurry up.
Jane and her mom
 Had a typical mother-daughter
relationship.
 (exhales)
what do you think?
 With the role of the mother
played by jane.
 I know.
The shoes are pushing it.
 What time
are you coming home?
 You have an interview tomorrow.
 Not till the afternoon.
2:30.
 I know. I get it. I'll
be home by midnight.
 Don't drink too much,
 Don't kiss too much,
and don't forget to call
 If you're gonna be late.
 Honey, don't worry.
 Love you.
But jane did worry.
 Because if she didn't,
who would?
 Alba:
Jane.
 It was times like these
when young jane
 Wished especially hard
for a father.
 Someone responsible and wise,
 Someone who would take care
of things
 So she wouldn't have to.
 Someone like...
 Jimmy smits.
 See, jane held
a secret suspicion
 That jimmy smits
was her father.
 And she was equally sure
he'd come home any minute.
 But, alas, jane's father
was not jimmy smits.
 He was, however, a star
that burned just as bright.
 I do. I'm sorry,
abuela, but I do.
 She had 23 years to correct it,
and she didn't.
 She just kept lying.
 Please, abuela,
stop, all right?
 I just need some space
from her right now.
 Jane. Jane, come on.
We need to talk.
 We don't.
We do not have to.
 I made a mistake.
 A mistake?
 A mistake is losing your keys.
 You kept my
father from me.
I know.
 I'm sorry.
 (door opens)
 (door shuts)
 â™ª
 (phone whooshes)
 (phone whooshes)
 (phone whooshes)
 (indistinct chatter)
 Gracias.
Stop. The water's
for the fish.
 Mmm, mmm, mmm...
 No. It needs to be grand.
 Uh-huh?
(sighs)
too peach.
 I don't pop in peach.
 I like it,
 But not for this.
Make me bedsheets out of it.
 When does the scene shoot?
Shooting? No, this is not
make-believe, roxanna.
 This is real life.
My daughter is coming.
 So I must prepare to step
into the role of...
 Father.
 (knocking)
oh, yeah?
 How you been, mike?
It's been a while, huh?
 Yeah. Um,
look, uh,
 This isn't...
It's not a good time right now.
 Ah. Got it. I'll be quick.
Uh, I need money.
 Like, um,
$2k should cover things.
 $2,000?
(scoffs)
 What-what do you think I do
for a living?
Aw, come on.
 I'm sure you've been saving.
You're the responsible brother,
 Yeah, maybe dip
into that big wedding fund.
 How is jane, anyway?
 You stay away from her.
 Look, I'm trying, man.
 But... $2,000
would probably help.
 Rafael:
$10,000 cash right now
 To move out of this
apartment while we deal
with the divorce settlement.
 Raf, stop.
(sighs)
 Look, I made a mistake.
 A mistake?
Yes.
 A mistake is
a parking ticket.
 You're not thinking clearly.
Latin lover narrator:
In fact,
 Rafael was thinking
quite clearly.
 I'm thinking about the fact
that you screwed my best friend.
 Well... Stop thinking
about that.
 Think about jane.
See,
 That was part of the problem
as well.
 He had been thinking
about jane.
 (moaning)
or dreaming
 About her, I should say.
 Raf,
 Think about the baby.
 Magda:
Good morning,
 You two.
 Good morning, magda.
 (quietly):
We'll talk later.
 (door shuts)
 Listen, can you do me a favor?
 Name it.
Cover my lunch?
 Can't do it.
 I'm seeing my father.
(gasps)
 Today? Oh, my
god. Of course.
 Thank you. I love you.
 I love you, too.
Man:
Sweet.
 Make-out time.
 (groans)
 You're disgusting, tom.
 Hence his nickname...
 Lina:
You do realize
her fiancÃ©'s
 The cop who's been
interviewing everyone.
 Cool. Look forward
to talking to him
 About all the blood splatters
I saw
 And how hot
 His fiancÃ©e is.
 (shudders)
(exhaling)
 Okay, don't forget lunch,
okay?
 You can be late to your shifts
but not mine.
 (phone chimes)
I won't forget.
 It's my sister.
 I have to call her.
 What are you doing here?
 Look, I wanted to apologize
for last night. You're right,
 Okay? My issues
with my brother
 Shouldn't keep you from being
honest with your best friend.
 Yeah?
Yeah.
 Look, I think we should
just tell jane and michael
that we've been dating.
 (chuckles)
 Thanks, baby.
 Hi.
 I-I wanted to talk to you.
 Well, that's not all he wanted
to do to her.
 (moaning)
 It's about the-the baby.
 If it seems rafael is nervous,
 It's only because he is.
 What's going on?
 Because he knows
what he's about to say
 May change jane's feelings
 About what to do with the baby.
 Petra cheated on me
with my dead best friend,
 And our marriage isn't exactly
in the best place.
 What was that?
 That's what I
wanted to tell you.
 And also
that no matter what happens,
 I still want to raise this baby.
 Just you?
 Alone?
 Yes.
 Sorry.
 I just...
 I don't know.
I...
 It's just not what I pictured.
 I know. Me neither.
 But I still think
it's the best option, and...
 Jane, I want this baby.
 And I know your fiancÃ© doesn't,
 So...
No, he changed his mind
about that, actually.
 Oh.
 But does that change
what you want?
 Because I hope
it doesn't.
 It might.
 I mean,
I...
 I just had this picture
in my head,
 This thing I didn't have,
 A two-parent,
happy, stable home.
 And now you're telling me
that that's
 Not gonna happen.
Look, no decisions
have been made yet. I mean,
 Petra wants to go to
therapy, and I might...
Okay.
 Well, then
 We both have things
to think about, I guess.
 Okay, so I'll see you later.
 Okay. See you later.
 And then he said the fact
that he's getting a divorce
 Shouldn't affect me.
The guy's an idiot.
 Babe, stop.
I mean, he is the father
 Of the child.
I know.
I'm sorry.
 But whatever you want to do,
if you want to keep the baby,
 We will. We got plenty of room.
 There's a walk-in closet.
It's huge.
 We're not putting the baby
in the closet.
 I was kidding.
 No, but, really,
what are my options?
 I m...
I can
 Let him raise it alone or...
 The three of us share custody?
 Which is just...
Hard and complicated.
 Yeah, it would be.
 I'll support
whatever you decide.
 Just let me know
 Which way
you're learning towards--
 Baby, no baby.
 No closet.
 No closet. Got it.
 (chuckles)
 But, michael...
Hmm?
 His wife
 And his best friend.
 Can you believe that?
 Latin lover narrator:
He could believe it.
 Michael has known this
for a while,
 A fact he's kept hidden
from jane.
 Yeah. It's-it's crazy.
It's crazy.
 But, come on,
you're gonna be late.
 Okay. Wait, where's my envelope?
 Here. What's in it?
 Just... Some baby
pictures and...
 This jimmy smits thing.
 Just in case I need
a spontaneous icebreaker.
Always good to plan
 Spontaneous icebreakers.
(chuckles)
 No, be serious.
I'm nervous, michael.
 I'm going to get to know my dad.
 Which is really great timing
 Because I'm not talking
to my mom.
 I just... Want it to go well.
 I just really want it
to look good, michelle.
 What do you think
we'll talk about?
 What shoes should I wear?
 He's gonna love you.
 She's gonna love me, right?
 How could anyone not?
 (softly giggles)
 But is it the second door
to the left?
 Sorry, sorry, sorry I'm late.
 Sorry, sorry,
sorry I'm late.
 Sorry I'm late. Sorry.
 You must be jane.
My name is nicholas
 And I work for your
wonderful father.
Narrator: It should be noted
 That nicholas
had been prepared by rogelio.
 He was also told to bow.
 Come. Follow me.
 Rogelio.
 Jane's here.
 Rogelio:
Jane?
 Where is he?
 Latin lover narrator:
Understand that
 Rogelio had dreamed
of this moment
 Since he'd learned
he had a daughter.
 He wanted to make
a grand entrance.
 One his daughter
would never forget.
 Unfortunately...
 This was maybe
a little too grand.
 Hi, jane.
It's good to see you again.
 Hi, rogelio.
Call me dad.
 I think, rogelio, for now.
 Okay, we'll go with
rogelio for now.
 May I hug you?
 Yes. Oh.
Now.
 (soft grunt)
(applause, whistling)
 All the records, meaning what?
Time cards punched,
 Any hr incidents, tipping
percentages, I don't care.
 We need everything
you have on any employee
 That was working
the night of the murder.
Got it.
 Does that mean you think
one of my employees killed him?
 We didn't say that.
 Well, what can you say?
 To you? At the moment...
 Nothing.
 Well... I mean, it has to be.
 Otherwise, what is this
really about, detective?
 Latin lover narrator:
Well, actually, this is
 A really tricky question.
 On the surface, this is about
the fact that a bellboy
 Might connect
roman zazo's murder
 To sin rostro, the notorious
drug dealer known as
 The man without a face.
 But underneath,
their tension was actually
 About jane. The woman
with the beautiful face.
 Again.
 This is official
police business.
 We really can't talk about it.
 I'll get you the records.
 So what? Suddenly
you want the kid?
 I want what jane wants.
 Got it.
 But sorry to hear
about your marriage, man.
 (chuckles)
 Tough break.
 Jane:
Honestly?
 I can't believe my mom
kept you from me for so long.
 Yeah, I know.
 It is a crime.
Mm.
 In many ways,
a hate crime.
 I guess we're just gonna have
to make up for lost time.
 Yeah.
I'm moving out
of the house.
 I know this is a lot to ask,
 But I was wondering
if there was any way...
 You could stay with me?
 I would love nothing more.
 Great. 'cause I really
hate my mom these days.
 You see? We have
something in common, then.
 (laughs) oh, oh,
that reminds me.
 I made this doll of her.
 Do you want to
stick pins in it?
 No.
 We should set it aflame.
 (giggles)
 (cackling)
 Xiomara:
And they'll sit there and laugh
 And watch as I explode.
 Maybe not exactly
like that, fine.
 Yeah, and she hates me.
 Latin lover narrator:
This was good advice, because
 There's no way xiomara
could imagine their meeting.
 (sighs)
 No, thank you.
Please, have some.
 I'm pregnant, so...
Right, yeah, of course.
 I'm sorry.
I will have some, nick.
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that rogelio
 Always liked a glass of wine
when he was nervous.
 More. Nice.
 Latin lover narrator:
And he was very nervous.
 To my daughter,
jane gloria villanueva.
 Gloriana. Jane gloriana.
 To you.
 Ah.
 So how do you like the set?
 I had the crew work
on it around the clock.
 Oh, you didn't have to do that.
It was no trouble. Actually,
I didn't move a finger.
 So, um, where are we, exactly?
 ChichÃ©n itzÃ¡. Mayan temple.
 It's a quick fly
from mexico city.
 So this must mean
something to you.
 Indeed, it does.
Tell me.
 Well, as a younger man,
at a very low point in my life,
 I climbed to the top
of the temple
 And I prayed.
It was
 A very spiritual
moment for me.
 Wow.
What did you pray for?
 Great fame.
 Jane, I'm sure you must have
many questions about me.
 Yes, I do, I...
And the best way
to get those answers
 Is by reading this.
 It says
unauthorized biography,
 But, actually, one of my many
publicists wrote it.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 Now, tell me everything
about yourself.
 I wonder what we have
in common.
 Clearly, we have
nothing in common.
 He's shallow and vain and
 Not what I imagined him to be.
 I'm freaking out
about this.
 I... I just need
to talk to my...
 Latin lover narrator:
Oh, dear.
 She was about to say
her mother.
 You could
call her, janie.
 No.
 Okay.
 I'll be your mom.
First thing you say.
 What do I do?
 You should...
 Give him another try.
 And he's probably
just really nervous.
 Maybe see him again
but on your turf.
 Away from the
mexican ruins.
 (chuckles)
 Let's have him
over for dinner,
 Something casual,
low-key.
 That sounds perfect.
 No. Perfect is tacos,
 Beer, espn, you wearing
nothing but my ronaldo jersey.
 Yeah, I think that'd be
a little weird for my dad.
 Maybe I can cook for him.
 Since when do you cook?
 I'm an honors student, michael.
 I can follow a recipe.
 And I'll get a good one
from my grandma.
 Why is it so messy in here?
 Oh, sorry, it's
paperwork.
 Mm.
 Hey, why is my name
on this list?
 (gasps)
am I a suspect for something?
 It's the list of the
people working the hotel
 The night of the murder.
 Well, it isn't right,
because I know one bellboy
 That was definitely working
and not on here.
 Disgusting tom.
 Oh, my god. (gasps)
 That's a clue, right?
 Easy, veronica mars.
(giggles)
 It's just an oversight.
 You trade shifts with people all
the time and don't tell anyone.
 But I will let you know
when you cracked the case.
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I just did, babe.
 (laughs)
 How difficult is it
not to get caught cheating?
 Blaming me won't help,
mother.
 Petra, you promised.
After what happened,
 You said you would
always take care of me.
 I know, I know,
and I will.
 (sighs) I think I got through
to him. A little bit.
 He wants
that child.
 Petra.
 He must also want you.
 Darling. Your skin is so dry.
 You must take
care of that.
 Your beauty is your weapon.
 One of your weapons.
 You understand what I'm saying?
 Jane?
 (sighs)
you're supposed to be
at dance class.
 You think I can dance when my
daughter won't speak to me?
 I just came for a recipe.
 How was your meeting
with your father?
 How do you think it was?
 We're strangers. I don't
know anything about him
 And he doesn't know
anything about me.
 I'm sorry, jane.
Yeah.
 You know, you keep
saying that,
 But it's hard to get
to the "it's okay" part.
 Because it's not okay.
 What you did to me--
what you took away from me--
 It's not okay.
 And I just don't understand
how you could've done it.
 Because you're not
a mother yet.
 You know,
 When you were little,
 We'd go to the park
 And there'd be
all these moms there,
 Talking about their kids
and how great they were.
 And I remember thinking
they were crazy.
 Because it was so obvious
that I got the best one.
 I loved you so much,
 And I just got scared.
 Of what?
 I don't know.
 What if he came and made
some kind of claim on you?
 What if he wanted
to make plans,
 What if he wanted
to take you away?
 It was easier to pretend
that he didn't exist.
 Easier for you.
 But now I have
this man in my life--
 My father-- and I don't even
have a relationship with him.
 And that's not easy, mom.
 I know it's not,
and I'm sorry.
 And you don't
have to say
 It's okay, now, I know,
it's not, but...
 ...We're gonna get
through this eventually,
 Right?
 I don't know.
 I really don't know.
 Woman:
We have five plastic surgery
recovery suites now.
 If we expand into the new site,
we could have as many as 20.
 But hospital grade, as
we did with the others.
 And carry through...
Michael: Excuse me.
 Latin lover narrator:
As you might have noticed,
 When rafael and michael speak,
 It's often more about
what is unspoken than spoken.
 What can I do for you,
detective cordero?
 Can we talk to you
for a sec?
 Apparently, there were
some names missing
 From that employee list
you gave us?
 We want to make sure
it's just an oversight.
 I have no idea
what you're talking about.
 I know at least one bellboy
who worked that night
 That wasn't on the list.
 Anything I can do to help.
 We need information on him.
 No problem.
Great.
 (elevator bell dings)
 Okay, I need to
tell you something.
Mm-hmm.
 At first you're gonna
be a little mad,
 But then you're gonna
realize it's okay.
 Oh, yeah? Is that
what's gonna happen?
 I hope.
What is it?
 Well, you know I've been
seeing this guy, right?
 Mm-hmm.
It's billy.
 Michael's brother, billy.
 What?
 I know.
 For how long?
Like, six weeks.
 What?! At my engagement party?
 We had sex in michael's
bathroom. Yeah.
 Lina!
I know!
 Michael and his brother--
they don't get along.
 He doesn't even like
to talk about him.
 And that's why billy wanted
to keep it
 On the down-low,
because if it went away,
 It went away.
 But at this point,
we want you to know.
 I mean, what if he's using you
to piss off michael?
 Okay, first of
all, thanks.
Well, no. Come on.
 I didn't mean it like that. You
know I didn't mean it like that.
 I just don't want you
to get hurt.
 And michael says that
he's been in a lot of trouble.
 I know, and he's been
honest with me about it,
 But he's changed.
 Just ask michael to
give him a chance.
 (sighs)
 Rafael?
 Petra, I'm...
 Look what I found.
 You kept the frisbee?
 Of course I kept it.
 Rafael:
A frisbee, maybe,
but not a hat.
 Of course it's a hat.
 How big is our kid's head
going to be?
 I know. It's
awful, okay?
 You see, I'm really not
prepared to be a mom.
 Stop.
 You're gonna be great.
 (sighs)
come here.
 And our kid will grow
into the frisbee.
 (laughs)
 God, the service
in this place is terrible.
 How long does it take
to get a margarita?
 Yeah.
 Beautiful location, though.
 It definitely
has potential.
 What, as in a place
to invest in?
 I mean, it needs
a huge remodel.
 And I'd have
to empty my trust fund,
 Which would be
a huge undertaking.
 I'd be risking a lot.
 Well, I think you should do it.
 I believe in you.
 We were so happy.
 And then we
had all the...
 Well... Bad luck.
 The miscarriage, cancer.
 But we can get back
to what we had.
 I wish it was that easy.
 But it can be.
 We have the best reason
of all to stay together.
 A baby.
 And I know how much
you want that.
 And I know how
much I want you.
 Just calm down, baby.
You don't understand. Billy's
only dating lina to piss me off.
 Yeah, I told her that,
and got to be honest,
 Didn't really go over great.
 Well, that's what's happening.
 He thinks that the closer
he gets to you,
 The more uncomfortable I'll get,
and I'll give him money.
 That's what he wants.
It's what he always wants.
 $2,000, he asked me
this time.
 What?!
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
 Because I said no,
because I'm saving for us,
 Our future.
 And he knows I don't want him
hanging around you,
 So he's hanging with lina
to get under my skin.
 Well, don't let him get
under your skin,
 Because I can handle myself
with your brother.
 Jane, you don't understand.
 Okay. Well, just
tell me then, michael.
 Look, you know
I was a bad kid.
 We talked about this.
 And I don't need him
telling you stories.
 Okay. Is there
a story in particular
 You don't want him
telling me about?
 We used to do
stupid things.
 What kind of stupid things?
 Mostly...
 Stealing cars and
selling the parts.
 Oh, so, like, illegal
stupid things.
 Yeah.
 We worked out of
this old garage.
 The cops found it.
 He was only 16,
no record.
 I already was in trouble.
 Billy took the blame.
 What?!
I tried to come forward,
 But our-our lawyer said that if
I did, he'd still be in jail
 For lying.
 Oh, my god.
 Yeah.
 After that, I-I...
I turned my life around.
 He went the other way.
 And I've been bailing
him out ever since.
 (sighs heavily)
 I wish you'd told me about this
a while ago, you know?
 I should have.
 But it's not something
I'm-I'm proud of, so...
 You don't have
to be proud with me.
 Just honest.
 I can handle this stuff.
 Just be honest with me,
okay, michael?
 Especially now with my mom lying
and everything that's happened.
 I just need it.
 Yeah, I know.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry to just
barge in like this,
 But I didn't know
if you would want to see me.
 I really screwed things up
with jane, xiomara.
 Oh, no. What happened?
 (man speaking spanish on tv)
 Oh, I'll turn that off.
 No. No, please.
 It relaxes me.
 Xiomara:
Rogelio?
 Yes. What?
 And it was terrible, xiomara.
 When I am nervous, I talk,
 And I was so nervous.
 Everything you told me
about her--
 How smart she was, and how she's
going to be a teacher, and...
 You know, I never
did well in school,
 So, maybe I overcompensated
a little.
 The mayan ruins?
 It was actually quite beautiful,
 But, yes, in retrospect,
a little over the top.
 Right. See, the thing is,
 Jane's not impressed
with money or power.
 She likes going to the
movies or shopping at target.
 That kind of thing,
low-key stuff.
I see.
 I just want
to get it right with her.
 And, anyway,
she reached out again
 And invited me
for dinner tonight.
 So, I thought, you know,
maybe you could come
 To help make things
less awkward.
 Oh. I would, but...
 Jane and I--
 Well, we're not exactly on
the greatest of terms right now.
 Because of me?
 No. Because of me.
 (sighs)
 The last thing I wanted was
to affect your relationship.
 I know, and you've been
surprisingly... Understanding.
 She's just having a
hard time with it, which
 I also understand.
 (voice breaking):
I'm sorry.
 This is so
embarrassing.
 (sighs)
 You'll be fine.
 Just be yourself.
 Jane just wants
to get to know you.
 She wants to show you
baby pictures,
 Normal stuff like that.
 Okay, so, I tried to make
one of my grandma's recipes,
 But michael is
right. I can't cook.
 But in your unauthorized bio
it says
 That you were fond
of takeout thai.
 Oh, and sake bombs, it said.
 Yes.
(laughs)
 No, I-I-I... No,
I think I'll-I'll...
 I will pass at the moment.
 (laughs)
okay.
 Latin lover narrator:
In fact, things seemed
 To be going surprisingly well.
 Should we get started?
Let's.
 Actually, there is something
I did want to talk to you about.
 Hmm?
It's about your mom.
 Michael:
Pad thai.
 Well, hello.
What about her?
 You have to understand
that she was not wrong.
 Excuse me?
When I was 17,
 I was an idiot-- kicked out
of school, smoking weed.
 She wanted
to protect you.
Look.
 I think it's really nice
that you want to defend her,
 But I don't want to
talk about it, okay?
 Mm.
Right, that's between
me and my mom.
 So, how did you get
into telenovelas?
 Jane, well, she was terrible,
but she was scared.
 Rogelio, come on.
I just want you
to see her side.
 I know her side.
She was crying, jane.
 And you don't think
that I've cried?
 But you wouldn't
know that because
 You don't know
anything about me,
 Not even my
middle name.
 And that's because of her.
 And I guess for you,
it is easy to forgive that
 Because you've only know
about me for 16 months.
 But I have thought about you
every single day
 For the past 23 years.
 You know what?
 I'm-I'm sorry, I can't do this.
 Rogelio, you seem like
a nice enough man,
 But we haven't been a
part of each other's lives
 Until now, and we've been fine,
so let's not force it.
 (sighs)
 (sighs)
 So... Your dad left.
 I made him a little to-go box.
 Extra cashew chicken,
for future reference.
 Thanks.
 It's funny.
 I kept telling
myself going in,
 "no expectations,
no expectations."
 It's impossible not
to have expectations.
 What were they?
 You know, the fantasy.
 Someone I could connect
with immediately,
 Someone who I can see
myself in, who gets me.
 Maybe someone who can help me
figure out what to do right now.
 About the baby?
 Yeah.
 Rafael as a single father
is not what I pictured.
 And I didn't picture
us raising it with him.
 There's no perfect answer.
 But I'm in it with you,
remember?
 (sighs)
 I know.
 And I wouldn't be able
to do it without you.
 I don't want to fight anymore.
 Neither do I.
 These are the divorce papers.
 You were about to have
sex with me yesterday.
 We stopped.
Yes. But I could tell
you didn't want to.
 Petra, please, let's keep what
little dignity we have left.
 Jane's going to change her mind.
You're going to have to share
custody of that baby.
 I'm hoping I won't.
 You will. You know you will.
 Rafael, we can work it out.
 Not if I don't love you anymore.
 You make me sick.
 I understand.
 So sign the divorce papers.
You'll get your $250,000
 And we'll be done
with each other.
 Hi.
 What are you doing here?
 I heard what you said
about not forcing things.
 This is not forcing things.
 This is... Apologizing.
 I think I was
trying to make up
 For all these years
in two hours.
 (sighs)
 I was trying to impress you.
 But I went
too far, so...
 I'm sorry.
 No. It's okay.
 I think I was hard on you,
 And I had expectations
that were...
 Totally unreasonable.
 Then let's begin again.
 Can we?
 Mm-hmm.
 Good.
 Your mother told me you
brought baby pictures,
 So I brought you
one as well.
 To celebrate our relationship.
 I-I don't know what to say.
 Say nothing. It's yours to keep.
 I was also thinking
about what you said, how...
 We haven't been a part of each
other's life for 23 years.
 And that's true.
 But I didn't know about you
all that time.
 But...
 Now that I know,
 I'm not walking away from you,
jane gloriana villanueva.
 Even if it's not perfect.
 Nothing's perfect.
 Perfect is a fantasy.
 Latin lover narrator:
And in this moment,
 Jane realized
she had something in common
 With her father after all.
 I can't walk away
from this baby.
 And I know that's not
what you want to hear,
 But that's where I'm at.
 Whether you stay with
petra or get a divorce...
 We're divorcing.
 I'm sorry.
 But, regardless,
I can't walk away.
 And I wanted
to be honest with you
 Because you were honest with me.
 And you're okay with this?
 I am.
 Absolutely.
 So, what,
 I'm gonna get my kid
on weekends?
 'cause I'll fight for more time.
 We'll have
to work out custody.
 It's not gonna be easy.
 I know.
 But nothing is
and nothing's perfect.
 We'll just have to make it work.
 Absolutely.
 Together.
 We'll figure
this out.
 Okay.
 Are you okay?
 Not really.
 I'm freaking out.
 Well, just know
that I am freaking out with you.
 I do.
 Thank you, michael.
 And when you get home,
be prepared for tacos, beer
 And me in your ronaldo jersey.
 (elevator bell dings)
yes.
 (chuckles)
 (exhales)
 (phone chimes)
 And now I must draw your
attention back to jane's plan.
 The one that involved tacos.
 Beer.
 And her in a ronaldo jersey.
 The only problem?
 She could not find that jersey.
 I can get you the number
of a few custody lawyers I know.
 Thanks.
 This whole thing
is just messed up.
 (sighs)
 A guy I can't stand
is gonna be involved
 In raising my kid.
 I just don't know
what jane's doing with him.
 Rafael, do you have
feelings for her?
 It's... Complicated.
 Not that complicated.
 He liked her.
 (screaming)
 Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
 Oh, my god.
But, alas,
 Dead bellboys tell no tales.
 Who did this?
(gasps)
 S-sin...
 Rostro.
 Anymore.
 I'm sorry, mother.
 I really thought
it was going to work out.
 I know you
did, darling.
 But, eh...
 It's done.
 No use worrying.
You'll just ruin your skin.
 Come. Sit.
 Let's moisturize.
We'll come up with a plan.
 (grunts)
ooh.
 Moisturizer's not going
to help that.
 But I don't understand.
 What is sin rostro?
 Not what, who.
He's a big drug kingpin
 Who disappeared for a few years
and recently resurfaced.
 Connected to my hotel?
 Well, your friend roman zazo
seemed to have had
 Some sort of relationship
with him.
 Wait, why am I just now
hearing about this?
 We couldn't compromise
the investigation.
 Zazo
was waiting
 To be contacted by sin rostro
just before he died.
 Wait, there have been
two murders now.
 In my hotel.
Nadine:
And we want to prevent
 Any more.
 Which is why all of this
needs to stay in this room.
 No one can know
what the bellboy said.
 No one breathes
the words "sin rostro."
 Do you understand?
 Jane.
 What's going on?
 Jane...
 You knew.
 All this time,
 You knew and you didn't tell me.
 I didn't want to compromise
the investigation.
Oh, please.
 Who was I gonna tell?
 It's complicated.
No, it's not.
 You lied to me.
 You stood there this morning
when I was telling you
 That petra cheated on rafael
with his best friend
 And you pretended
to be surprised.
I know.
 I-I felt... I feel terrible.
 Are you kidding me?
 (sighs)
 I didn't tell you
about the affair
 Because when I found out you
were pregnant, I freaked out.
 I didn't want the baby.
But I changed my mind.
 You know this.
I changed my mind.
 You would've let me give
that baby
 To a couple
who may have been totally wrong.
 I made a mistake.
Yes, I made a mistake.
A mistake?
 Wait. Jane. Jane.
Please. Please.
I got to go.
 Let go of me.
I'm sorry.
 Look, I screwed up.
 I was scared, I was stupid.
 But everything I did,
I did because I love you.
 Jane.
 D-don't leave.
 â™ª
 (phone chimes)
 Latin lover narrator:
But jane didn't know
if she could forgive him.
 In fact, in that moment,
 Betrayed by the man
she thought she knew so well,
 Jane gloriana villanueva
knew only one thing:
 She needed her mother.
 Honey.
 (crying)
 (shuddering breath)
 (shuddering breaths)
 You could
have warned me.
 You would have said no.
 And it was the only way
to break that prenup.
 Man:
Mrs. Solano,
 You sure you're feeling okay?
Yes,
 Much better. Thank you.
Good.
 So, can you tell me
how this happened?
 My husband did it.
 And I'd like to file
a police report.
 It's true.
 Sometimes you really do need
your mother.
