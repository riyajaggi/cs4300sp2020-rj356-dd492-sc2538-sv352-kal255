 Latin lover narrator:
All right, let's dive in.
As you know, jane was
 Accidentally inseminated
with rafael's sperm.
 But I've never had sex.
This created some ups
 And some downs.
On the bright side...
 I'm here.
...Jane felt herself falling
 For her baby daddy.
Hi.
 On the downside...
I mean, we're so different.
 We're having a baby.
Let's focus on that.
 But rafael wouldn't
take no for an answer.
 And I'm gonna fight for you too.
Unfortunately,
rafael's soon-to-be
 Ex-wife wasn't going down
without a fight.
We're done, petra.
 Jane's got to change
her mind. You guys have to
share custody of that baby.
 But petra had bigger problems.
 See, she was being
blackmailed by ivan,
 The man who knew
her secret identity.
Natalia.
 And she had accidentally
taken him hostage.
 (grunts)
stop it!
 Oh, and jane's
ex-fiancÃ©e michael--
 He was on the hunt
for the notorious drug dealer
 Sin rostro.
I don't like this.
 And he was getting closer.
He's gone.
 And now, let's start.
Where'd he go?
 They say you never
forget your first...
 Short story.
 Certainly, young
jane gloriana villanueva
 Remembered everything about
the night she wrote hers.
 It was as though
something opened inside her.
 Suddenly, her world
became magical.
 Printer: Keep going.
You're good at this.
 Teddy bear: You're awesome,
jane. You're doing great.
 Virgin mary: I think
you've found your calling.
 Teddy bear: Your mommy's
gonna be so proud of you.
 Printer:
Keep going.
 Printer:
Show your mom.
 Xiomara:
No. Mommy,
 This is what I'm good at.
 It's my dream.
 Xiomara:
It's okay. Don't cry, ma.
 Latin lover narrator:
Like I said, jane never forgot
 The night she wrote
her first short story.
 It was the same night
she learned
 Dreams weren't practical.
 And so jane kept hers a secret.
 But she never stopped dreaming.
 See, for years,
jane had been submitting
 Stories to online magazines.
 And she had the archived
rejection letters to prove it.
 (computer dings)
 So she assumed she had
just received another one.
 But at this
particular moment,
 She was wrong,
and thrilled to be so.
 Hallelujah!
 I told you
you were good at this.
 Morning, everyone.
 Is it the
pregnancy hormones
 Or did something really
good just happen?
 Latin lover narrator:
Something really, really
good just happened.
 Just excited
about your big meeting
 With your record label guy.
 I'm not nervous.
 He heard my demo
and he liked it,
 And so we're meeting.
It's not a big deal.
 Just because this is
my lifelong dream
 Doesn't mean I'm so
suddenly freaking nervous.
 (laughs)
and then excited,
and then back to nervous.
 Jane: You'll be great, mom.
You're absolutely sure
 You don't need me today
at your sonogram?
I'm sure.
 And you can take the car.
 I'm going with rafael,
and we're taking the bus.
 It's his first time.
 Aw.
Cute, right?
 Muy cute.
So, so cute.
 Uh, so-so where do I...
 You just slide it.
 Like a credit card.
 Oh. Got it,
like a credit card.
 Great.
 So we can just sit anywhere?
 It's nice. Hey,
no, no, no, no.
 No, webmd. No...
Oh.
 You're right.
 But can't I just
look up the nuchal fold
 So that I know
what they're looking for?
 No, no. It's a wormhole.
It's gonna make you nervous.
 We talked about this.
 Huh?
 You're right.
 So, just to be clear,
 I know we had a rough
official first date,
 But we are
back on, right?
 Back on? What are you,
like, 14 years old?
 Will you just indulge my
14-year-old self, please?
 (giggles)
are we?
 We're taking it slow.
 As long as we're
taking it somewhere.
 (laughs)
 And as long...
 As I can kiss you.
 What... No.
 Less kissing, more talking.
 We got to start to get
to know each other, right?
 Right. Okay. Tell me something
about you that I don't know.
 Well, I've been
submitting short stories
 To online magazines for years.
 And this morning, I found out
from the cincinnati review
 That they want to publish one.
 What? Th-that's great.
So when does it go up?
 Oh, I'm not gonna let them
publish it, actually.
 Why?
The main character
in the story, lucy,
 Is a feisty, single mom
that wears booty shorts
 And entertains
a revolving door of guys.
 â™ª
 Ah. Well, I'm
sure your mom's
 Got a sense of humor
about herself, right?
 There's a line in it that says
she puts the "loose" in lucy.
 I-I... I mean...
 I took some creative license,
but it is based on her, and...
 I shouldn't have sent it in.
 It was just my favorite story,
and I wanted to see what it...
 Anyway... It's an honor just
to get the recognized, right?
 The recognition is nothing.
Only the award matters.
 To win my second
consecutive paloma--
 It would be unheard of.
 I'm gonna live-tweet
the show.
 Hashtag: Goro.
Hashtag: Rogeliomybrogelio.
 Hashtag: Vivadelavega.
 Excuse me.
Rogelio.
 Hello.
 Esteban. Hello to yourself.
 I was just seeing
where I sit...
 For when I win.
 How funny. I was just seeing
where I sit for when I win.
Well, we can't both win.
 No, we can't. Unless we tie.
Which we won't.
 I suppose we'll see
who wins then.
 Let the biggest star shine.
 He's so cocky.
 Okay, let's practice
my acceptance speech.
 I would like to thank
 God, for giving me
all this talent.
 Latin lover narrator:
And while rogelio was
thanking his god,
 Xiomara was praying to hers.
 Please, please, please
let today's meeting go well.
 The one and only paulina rubio.
 My entire life I've been
hoping for a chance like this.
 Today is the day, xo.
 You're gonna step into
 Your destiny.
 In different shoes, of course.
 You're sexy,
you're not a stripper.
 And pump up the lipstick
 A shade. Perfect.
 Yes. Go, go, go.
 We're screwed.
 We are, we're screwed.
We are not screwed.
 We lost a serbian
war criminal.
No one even knows he was here.
 Yeah, because we didn't
report our lead. But this--
 This is crazy.
What is the connection
 Between sin rostro
and the serbian?
I don't know.
 And where the hell
is the serbian?
I don't know.
 Exactly. Which is why
we have to report it.
 We don't have to report it,
we have to solve it.
 Listen, I have a theory, okay?
 Sin rostro went
underground, right?
Mm-hmm.
 Around the same time
rafael got cancer.
 What?
As soon as rafael's better
 And takes over the hotel...
 Sin rostro resurfaces
and there are two murders.
 That's your theory?
That rafael is sin rostro?
 It can't all be a coincidence.
 Where's your evidence?
 Latin lover narrator:
Well, that was a problem.
 As he had none. Yet.
 I like you, michael.
 But I am not
risking my badge
 So you can indulge in
your rafael vendetta.
 You got to
let go of jane.
 This is not about jane.
 Less than 2.5 millimeters.
 We want the nuchal fold
to be less than 2.5 millimeters.
 I'm confused.
When did you go on webmd?
 In the bathroom.
 It just needs to be under 2.5.
 If it's over, that can signal
genetic abnormality.
 Can you just maybe
give me a ballpark?
 I'm not allowed to say anything.
 Only a doctor can give results.
 Right. I'm sorry.
 You said that several times.
 It's gonna be okay.
 (mouthing)
 Do you believe in god?
 What?
 I was just praying,
and I wondered.
 Uh...
 I-I... I don't know.
 I-I've just never been one
for organized religion.
 But you were raised
 Catholic though, right?
 Yes.
 Sorry, it...
 Just seems like
the kind of thing you talk about
 Before a sonogram.
 I was accidentally
artificially inseminated.
 I'll get the doctor.
 Mm.
Thank you.
 I just...
 Well, I imagined that...
 My kids would be baptized
 And go to Sunday school.
 Sunday school?
Kids hate Sunday school.
 Doesn't mean
they shouldn't go.
 Okay, compromise.
 Prep school with a
religious component.
 Private school?
Are you serious?
 Are you kidding?
 Have you seen the state
of public education today?
 It's horrible.
Yeah, sure, there are problems.
 But there are great upsides,
like more diversity.
 Means less of a chance
of being an entitled snob.
 Percentage-wise. Not you.
 Okay. Everything looks great.
 The fetus is around
three inches long
 Right now--
about the size of a peach.
 Latin lover narrator:
And in that moment, all
their differences faded away,
 And jane and rafael were
perfectly and completely happy.
 I'm so sorry I'm late.
 Come on. Did you think
it would last?
 What the hell are
you doing here?
 What do you mean?
This is my baby, too.
 What?
Oh, no, no.
 Excuse me, what's going on?
 I'm sorry, my
ex-wife is crazy.
 You have zero claim
on this baby.
 You sure about that?
Do you remember
 After the, uh...
The miscarriage,
 When you and I were talking
about maybe using a surrogate?
 We drew up a pre-planned
adoption contract,
 Which stipulated that you and I
would be the legal parents
 Of the surrogate's child.
 And jane
 Is now serving as a surrogate.
 I am not a surrogate.
She's not a surrogate.
 Oh, I'm sorry,
did you want this baby?
 Because there's a pretty clear
record of the fact
 That you didn't, starting with
your lawsuit against his sister.
 Which I withdrew.
 Ah. Not from the public records.
 Hey, hey.
 So I'm pretty sure this contract
will hold up in court.
 Especially since we haven't
 Reached a divorce
settlement yet.
 Why are you doing this?
For the money?
 I'm... Are you suggesting
that I'm not genuinely invested
 In the well-being of this baby?
 Because that's offensive.
 No, I want to be a part
of this child's life.
 And I'm willing to fight
for that right.
 Jane, are you okay?
Yeah.
 Just trying not to stress.
 It's important not to stress.
 At least, according to webmd.
 I e-mailed
my dad's lawyers.
 What if she does have a claim
on our kid?
 She doesn't.
Believe me,
 All petra wants is money.
 I'll pay her off if I have to.
 Is that really the way to go?
To just give her money?
 In this case, yes.
 But she doesn't deserve it.
 But that might be the only way
to shut this down.
 (sighs)
 You're probably wondering
why I'm here.
 As you may have heard
through social media,
 I've been nominated for
my second consecutive paloma.
 Congratulations.
 Thanks. It's an honor
just to get the recognition.
 And I would love to have
 All three villanueva women
with me
 At the awards ceremony.
(alba yelps)
 (laughs)
 I'd say that's a yes.
 The man is a fraud.
He cannot make a proper
 "I'm longing for you
but cannot have you" face.
 Watch this.
 Latin lover narrator:
I should point out
 That right at this moment
rogelio is not acting.
 He is, in fact,
longing for xiomara.
 But, alas, these two had agreed
not to date,
 So as to not complicate jane's
relationship with her father.
 I have to run.
Meeting with a record producer.
 Wish me luck.
Come.
 A hug from rogelio
is like a rabbit's foot.
 Lucky, rare,
and soft to the touch.
 (clears throat)
 Bye.
Bye.
 (chuckles)
 Walk tall, xo.
 Class.
 Confidence.
 And shake
 That ass just a tiny bit.
 The producers
are gonna love you.
 (man screams on tv)
petra: What's wrong?
 Those stupid pirates, they have
santos tied up in dungeon.
 No, I mean... What's wrong
with the way I look?
 I need to be downstairs, and...
 Something's not right.
 More red around your eyes.
 Like you've been crying.
 Put your hair up.
 Makes you look more serious.
 Petra:
Okay. Better.
 Come on, mother.
 I need you
for the sympathy vote.
 (gasps)
 Seriously, baby? This is
how you thank me for the job,
 A gambling ring?
 If we have to work
this telenovela after party,
 Might as well make it fun.
 Best actor, jane's
dad or esteban?
 Oh, esteban. He's everything.
 And your brother is here.
 Well, here we go.
 Seriously?
It's like an oscar pool.
 You gonna arrest me?
 I'm not gonna arrest you.
 I need your help.
 Look, if you think
rafael solano's a drug dealer,
 Arrest him.
That's the thing.
I need some proof.
 I got to be sure
before I bring him in.
 You know, 'cause he's jane's...
 (sighs)
 The father of jane's baby.
 So you're going rogue.
 Dig around.
See what you can find out.
 200 bucks.
 $350.
 It was awful.
 I walked in,
 And I could literally see
his face fall.
 He said he thought from my song
I'd be younger.
 (sighs)
 I don't know. Maybe it's a sign.
 Maybe I should focus on my dance
school, try to really grow it.
 There's got to be
lots of studio space
 In the city.
 Jane got a story published?
 Why didn't she
say anything?
 Woman:
Pay attention.
 (over tv): This is important.
Not only for my client,
 Petra solano,
 But for all women who enter into
nonbiological birth contracts.
 We are pioneering a new frontier
 In reproductive rights.
Rafael: Enough.
 Okay, so she hired
a big shot lawyer.
 That doesn't make her case
more valid.
 No, it doesn't. Unfortunately,
it does make the prospect
 Of shutting it down
more challenging.
 Okay, that's it.
 We'll offer
her a payout.
 I really think
she'll take it.
 Oh.
Hi.
 Hi.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 Are you okay?
What's going on?
 No, michael, I'm okay.
It's not your responsibility.
 I don't care. What-what is it?
 Jane, please.
 I just... You seem
really upset.
 Tell me why.
 Please.
 It's petra.
 She's making a play at custody
for the baby.
 What?
I know.
 That doesn't make any sense.
I know.
 She probably won't win,
but it's just this idea
 Of being in a long,
drawn-out court case.
 What does she want, money?
 It has to be.
 She doesn't want a kid.
 Okay.
 Maybe I can help.
 Aren't you nervous?
 I mean, putting her on tv?
 What if milos sees her?
 Please. Milos isn't watching
local miami news.
 And it's the only way
to get rafael to settle.
 (sniffs)
my god,
 It smells like
a kielbasa factory in here.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ivan realized
 The matches were a sign.
 He could escape
just like santos.
 As soon as he saw
the next episode.
 Magda, I am so hungry.
 (groans)
could...
 I have some more pretzels?
 You'd never guess
 I was the one in the wheelchair
and you were the hostage.
 Rafael: Wait, what are you
talking about?
 Zaz's murder is still unsolved,
and, officially,
 Petra is still
a person of interest.
 I can work as an informant
and gather information
 For the ongoing investigation.
 So, what, you're just
gonna wear a wire
 When you
talk to her?
Yes.
 Official police business.
 And michael can...
 And you can listen in
 And record everything.
 If I can get her on tape
admitting that she will
 Drop the custody claim
for the right price,
 We can get this thrown out
for good.
 I just... I don't know
if we should involve michael.
 The guy's got it out for me.
 He's just trying to help.
 It's a... It's a little naive.
 I think this is
a legitimate solution.
 It could shut it down.
 Look, I already worked out
a number with my lawyer.
 I'm gonna make her
an offer, okay?
 Maybe she'll accept it,
maybe she'll sign the papers,
 And then she'll leave us alone.
And what if she says no?
 Then we'll go a little higher.
Yeah, and then this will
just drag on. You know it will.
 There's no guarantee
that she's gonna say yes.
 And, honestly, I just think that
throwing money at the problem
 Is not the answer.
 Did you just say
"throwing money at it"?
 It's a band-aid.
It's not a permanent solution.
 Okay, just to be clear,
money is not some evil thing.
 All right? It can
be very helpful.
 And to say that it's not,
again, is just naive.
 Okay, you need to stop
calling me naive.
 Because you're the one
that married petra.
 That's the reason
why we're in this situation.
 All right, I asked around.
If rafael's
 In the drug trade,
he's deep, deep underground
 Because no one's heard
of him.
(groans)
 Damn it.
 On the upside,
 Here's his wallet.
 What the hell are you doing?
I didn't ask you
 To steal this.
It's no big deal.
 He lost it.
He'll... Find it again tomorrow.
 In the meantime,
check it out, huh?
 There's a key
sewn in here.
 Hmm? You don't sew a key
 Into a wallet
unless you're hiding something.
 And I'm sending professional
hair and makeup here.
 My gift to you.
Ay.
 You will likely be on camera
when I win.
 You don't look excited.
 Why are you not excited?
 So how was your meeting
at the record label?
 Â¿quÃ©?
 That is ridiculous.
 I don't know.
 Maybe it's time
to get realistic.
 Face the fact
 That I missed my window.
 â™ª libre, como el mismo aire,
vive libre â™ª
 â™ª como lo hace el viento,
vuela libre... â™ª
 Alba.
Hmm?
 Mm-hmm.
 Thanks, ma, but I think
it's time to let it go.
 Ay, mi amor.
 Oh, no.
Did the meeting not go well?
 Don't worry.
I'm fine.
 Easy.
 Loose. You know.
 You read my story.
 I borrowed your
computer, and I saw it.
 And I'm sorry for clicking.
I shouldn't have done that.
 And I first want to say
that I am really proud of you
 That they are publishing it.
 Mom...
 But wow.
(chuckles)
 "she puts the 'loose' in lucy"?
 You might as well
have called her xo the ho.
 Mom, I...
(sighs)
 I exaggerated for comic effect.
 But, I mean, is this what
you really think about me?
No.
 Mom, just please, listen...
Do you wish that
I was somebody else?
 The kind of mom that-that
wears bulky christmas sweaters
 And bakes a lot?
 No. Of course not.
 Lucy's daughter jen
seems to feel differently.
 (sighs)
 Look... I get the
exaggeration.
 But underneath it all,
is that how you feel?
 I did sometimes,
growing up.
 You were always dating
different guys.
 I didn't bring them home.
 Doesn't mean
I didn't know about them.
 And, you know,
except for anthony,
 No one ever really stuck.
 (sniffles)
 What do you remember
about anthony?
 I liked him.
 He was funny, he made me laugh.
 Yeah, he did.
 And after he broke up with me,
you were very sad.
 Do you remember that?
 I didn't want that to
happen again, so after...
 I kept things casual.
 To protect me?
 Yeah.
 That was really nice, mom.
 But enough already.
 All right, with...
With all the sacrificing.
 I'm-I'm a grown-up, okay?
 And-and you deserve to have
a happy, long-term relationship.
 That's what I want for you.
 Thanks, jane.
 And don't worry.
 I'm not going to sign that
publishing consent form anyway.
 Oh. I signed it for you.
 What?!
 I am not gonna be
 The reason that you
miss your window.
 Latin lover narrator:
Oh.
 If only all mothers
were this unselfish.
 Hand me my red
nail polish.
 The blood red.
 It is amazing the two of you
can still be so civil
 After everything that
happened with milos.
 We don't talk about milos.
 It is easier for you, no?
 You don't have horrible scar.
 You can still walk.
 Magda:
He's right, petra.
 It is not easy
 For me.
 I'm sorry about milos, mother.
 I should have
listened to you.
Yes.
 You should have.
 (siren wailing)
 Latin lover narrator:
Okay, that seems
a little dramatic.
 It was only five years ago.
 Latin lover narrator:
Yup, you guessed it. Milos.
 The breakup did not go well,
to say the least.
 As luck would have it,
petra saw
 A koruna on the street
at that very moment,
 And ducked down to pick it up.
 Her mother, on the other hand,
was not as lucky.
 (gasps)
mother!
 (screaming)
(car horn blaring, crash)
 Petra: I will never
forgive myself for that.
 Never.
I know.
 (sighs)
 (sighs)
 (phone chimes)
 (sighs)
 (door opens in distance)
 Passports, cash,
a burner phone.
 I knew it. I knew
something was going on.
 Now I just got to find it
all again... With a warrant.
 (women laughing)
 Can you imagine
if you actually got the baby?
 Enough. I've been dealing
with telenovelas all day...
 No! No, the show.
I am watching show.
 ...For the after party.
I need a break.
I am watching this show!
 Jane wants to meet.
Please.
 Turn tv on.
 I need to see santos.
 Okay, geez, relax.
 (crying, speaking quietly
in spanish)
 Petra: I have to go
meet jane, mother.
 Thanks for meeting me.
 I was thrilled you reached out.
 I really think we can solve this
in a civil way.
 I do, too.
 Do you want to order food,
or...?
 Petra: No, thank you.
I'm really not hungry.
 Thanks for letting me
listen in.
 I just want what's
best for jane.
 Me, too.
 I can see why
you'd be concerned.
 There's a lot of criminal
activity in this hotel.
 Jane: Because I want
to facilitate a solution.
 I'm just trying
to focus on jane.
 Petra:
Fantastic.
 A solution
sounds great.
Agreed.
 So, what is it
you're looking for?
 Uh, in terms of visitation?
 No, not in terms of visitation.
 Look, I can talk to
rafael, I can convince him
 To give you whatever you want.
 Well, that's-that's fantastic.
 'cause what I really,
 Truly want is this baby.
 Well, that's not gonna happen,
but I can assure you
 That the baby is going to be
just fine... With me.
 Are you sure
you can learn to love a child
 That you never even wanted?
 I am sure.
 I love this child-- my child.
 But what's wrong
with more people loving it?
 More people will love it,
like rafael.
 And me. See, I'm already
attached to it.
 I don't believe you.
 You don't really know
anything about me, do you?
 We're actually alike,
you and I.
 I really, really
don't think so.
 You think I don't know
what it means to struggle?
 Just like you, it's always been
me and my mother.
 My father was trapped
 Behind the iron curtain
during the cold war.
 When I was a baby,
 He sent me and my mother off
to west germany.
 He was meant to follow.
 For five years,
 We waited for him.
 But he couldn't get out.
 And he died one week--
one week--
 Before the wall fell.
 I'll never forget that feeling.
 Losing someone,
 Never getting the chance
to know them.
 (sniffles)
 That's why
I'm fighting for this baby.
 Nothing. Nothing.
 I know. I'm sorry.
 Where's rafael?
 Uh, he took-took off.
 What? Why?
 Uh, honestly, I don't know.
 He just kind of
stood up and left.
 But, um, listen, I-I...
 I do want to talk to you
about him.
 Something's going on with him,
something shady.
 What? What are you
talking about?
 I can't say.
 (laughs)
but trust me, jane.
 I only want
what's best for you.
 (sighs) rafael said that
you had it in for him.
 I said no.
 Well, there you go. You see,
he said that to cover himself
 In case I said something.
 Michael, stop.
Jane.
 Jane, listen.
No, just stop.
 Something's off with this guy.
 (knocking)
it's-it's open.
 What's going on?
Why'd you run off?
 When petra was talking
about her father,
 Did she seem like she was lying?
 No. That was the one moment
 I thought she was telling
the truth.
Exactly.
 Me, too. So I came up here
to check some facts.
 What facts?
 The iron curtain divided
europe into two separate areas
 From 1945
until the berlin wall fell
 In November of 1989.
 Why am I getting
a history lesson?
 Because petra said
that her father died
 One week before
the berlin wall fell,
 But according to everything she
ever told me and her passport,
 Petra was born in December
 Of 1989.
 So either she can
 Miraculously recall events
from before she was born...
 Or she's not
who she says she is.
 And we're live
from the red carpet
 Of the 14th annual
paloma awards.
 For the first time ever,
 We're hosting
them in beautiful
 Downtown miami.
All your favorite
 Telenovela stars are swarming
the red carpet as we speak.
 And of course,
one of the fiercest rivalries
 Of the night centers around
the best actor category.
 I have the two front-runners
here with me tonight--
 Rogelio de la vega
and esteban santiago.
 How are the two of you
feeling tonight?
 Wonderful.
Many may think we are rivals,
 But we're actually
very close friends.
Oh, yes?
 Yes, in fact, rogelio is
like a father to me.
 Which is remarkable, since
we're actually the same age.
 (sighs)
 I feel for esteban.
 He's tremendously overrated.
 There's nowhere for
him to go but down.
 Sorry I'm late. There's dramatic
stuff going on at the house.
 Announcer:
Please make your way inside.
 The show is about to begin.
 I need you to dig up as much as
you can as quickly as you can.
 (woman speaking spanish over tv)
 Oh, there...
 There, a storm coming.
You see that?
 We should probably
go to basement.
 You could take
off my cuffs.
 I would not run.
 Nice try.
 And now,
best villain in a telenovela.
 Get back to work.
The guests will be here soon.
 And now, the award
we've all been waiting for,
 Best actor in a dramatic series.
 The nominees are:
 Mateo alvarado,
the boldness of love.
 Enrique maldonado,
beautiful forever.
 Esteban santiago,
the glory and the temptation.
 And rogelio de la vega,
the passions of santos.
 And the winner is...
 (drumroll)
 Esteban santiago!
 (applause)
 I meant to do that.
 It'll go viral.
 One of those memes.
 Esteban:
Thank you so much
 To god for creating me
in his image.
 (phone chirps)
 Latin lover narrator:
But though the award show
was over,
 The drama was just getting
started at the after party.
 What's so important?
 I organized this party.
I need to be out there.
 We hired a private investigator.
 What?
 The best one money could buy.
 Turns out the real petra,
the one whose passport
 You've been carrying around--
 Well, she died
in the czech republic in 2008.
 So that leaves us
with a big question.
 Who the hell are you?
 Ivan:
Natalia.
 Rafael:
We'll keep digging
 Until we uncover
exactly who you are
 And what you're hiding,
unless
 You sign the divorce papers
 And agree
to stay the hell away from us
 And our baby.
 Okay. Yes.
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted
 That at this moment--
god or no god--
 It felt like a miracle.
 Indeed, there was something
in the air that night,
 And it was not just
the strong wind
 Mixed with the smell
of mushroom croquettes.
 It was something more magical.
 (gasps)
 I'm sorry. I've had
a little too much champagne,
 But you look just like
paulina rubio.
 I get that a lot.
 'cause I am paulina rubio.
 Oh, my god.
 You're just...
 I'm a singer,
 And you're just pretty much
god to me, so...
 Thank you. Thank you.
 What's your name?
 Um, xiomara.
Xiomara.
 Or you can call me xo.
 Or, you know,
whatever you want, really.
 What type of music do you sing?
 I sing pop, mostly.
 Well, no, I-I did. Uh...
 Things never really
took off for me.
 I actually think it's best I...
I let it go, you know.
 I missed my window.
 If it's your calling,
 If it's what
you're meant to do,
 There's no window.
 Lots of people tried
to tell me to give up.
 What if I'd listened?
 (clicks tongue)
no, chica.
 If you have it, if you really
want it, you do it.
 I got to go.
I have a big
 Concert tonight, but... You...
 You have something special.
 Stick to it, okay?
 So, you were right
to go to michael,
 And I was right to throw money
at an expensive p.I.
 Lesson learned.
 Yeah? What is that lesson?
 We're better together.
 Really? Because
I think the lesson is,
 Is that we're very different,
and there are a lot of things
 That are gonna come up
because of that.
 No. Refer back to my lesson.
 We are better... Together.
 And we'll
figure it out, jane.
 Whatever comes up--
school, religion,
 Or the other hundred things
 That we haven't thought about
yet-- we will figure it out.
 Okay?
 Why don't you tell
your 14-year-old self
 That we're cleared
for kissing, okay?
 Oh, thank you.
 (both sigh)
 Petra:
I've lost everything.
 We need to start over.
 Again.
 Maybe we should just
stop running, just go home,
 And if milos finds us,
then so be it.
 Don't say that.
 Never say that.
 You took care
of me then.
 I will take care of you now.
 Hey.
 Sorry you didn't win.
 I don't have
the shelf space, anyway.
 I-I didn't win either.
 We made this wager at work
about who would win best actor.
 I bet on you.
 You did?
Of course.
 Latin lover narrator:
And for a brief moment,
rogelio felt like he had won.
 You're not gonna believe this.
 I just met paulina rubio!
 Are you serious?
Just now.
 Outside.
It was magical.
 She told me
not to give up on my dream.
 Oh, my god, that's awesome.
 (phone chirps)
 I'm very happy for you, xiomara.
 Excuse me. I'll be right back.
 Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ah.
 You didn't tell xiomara
I sent you, right?
 Oh, of course not, rogelio.
 Don't worry about that.
 I mean, this is not you.
 Doing something nice
for someone
 And not willing
to take the credit?
 (speaks spanish)
she is.
 Thank you for helping me.
 Whatever you want.
You know that, okay?
 Really?
 Will you do an appearance
on one of my telenovelas?
 (chuckles, speaks spanish)
 You're so funny.
 Yeah. Uh...
I love you. No.
 Oh.
That's not gonna
happen ever.
 'cause you could be
whatever you want.
 You could be a pirate.
 Uh, ma, why don't you
have a seat.
 Hmm?
Yeah, maybe
we should get you some water.
 She's drunk.
 She's the best.
 (both laugh)
 Can I have some water, please?
 Hey, uh, what's going on
with you and rogelio?
 What do you mean?
 Come on.
 You guys obviously
like each other.
 I saw all the
googly eyes.
 Why don't you go for it?
 We're over that
commitment-phobia, remember?
 Okay, I am not gonna
let go of this,
 So you might as well tell me.
 The truth is, I've been
staying away from rogelio
 So that he can focus
on his relationship with you.
 I don't want it
to get complicated
 If things don't work out
with us romantically.
 Again, super sweet, mom, but
enough with the sacrifices.
 Not that I buy that it was
completely about me, anyway.
 What do you mean?
 Maybe sometimes
you use me as an excuse.
 Because one thing I do remember
 About your breakup with anthony
was how sad you were.
 Yeah, well, getting hurt sucks.
 I know.
 But that doesn't mean that
you shouldn't take a shot
 At doing something that
might make you really happy.
 What is this about?
 Nadine:
Mr. Solano, we have
 A warrant to search a safe
in this office.
 A warrant? Based on what?
 Based on a statement
from a hotel employee
 Who said the safe contains
criminal material.
 Billy: I was passing by,
and I saw
 What looked like
a stack of passports.
 Latin lover narrator:
And just like that,
 Billy's $350 became $500.
 No.
 (laughs) no.
 No. No way.
 I'm gonna go now.
 (door closes)
 (shouts):
No!
 Nadine:
What are you doing?
 A man vanishes from the room,
 Things are disappearing
from safes.
 Michael, calm down.
 How am I so far behind?
 Hey, hey, hey!
What am I missing?
 Hey, stop!
What am I...
 What is going on?
 I don't know, but
you need a break.
 Nadine...
 (mechanical whirring)
 What the hell?
 Latin lover narrator:
Oh, wow.
 An unexpected twist.
 Meanwhile, a tipsy alba
had decided
 To give petra
a piece of her mind after all.
 Get out!
Ivan:
Please!
 Please call the police!
I need help! I'm tied up!
 Get out! Get out!
 Go get help!
 (door creaks)
 (panting)
 (gasps)
 Latin lover narrator:
I told you the drama
was just getting started.
