 Latin lover narrator:
Glad you're back. Here we go.
 As you know, jane was
accidentally inseminated
 With rafael's sperm.
 I accidentally inseminated you
two weeks ago.
 Latin lover narrator:
Oh, and the doctor?
She was rafael's sister.
 And rafael underwrote her
medical malpractice insurance.
 No one would insure luisa
with her history of addiction.
 But jane didn't know that,
 And rafael wasn't
about to tell her.
 And from there,
things got complicated.
 See, jane was with michael,
but now she's not.
 And rafael was with petra.
We're done, petra.
 And despite
jane's reservations...
 What's better for a baby than
its parents actually together?
 ...Jane and rafael were falling
for each other.
 Unfortunately, jane's mother,
xo, did not approve.
 Rafael is already a bad
influence on you.
He's a good guy.
 For the record, xiomara's love
life was complicated as well.
 See, she was falling
for jane's father,
 Telenovela star
rogelio de la vega.
 But she broke it off.
 You have to focus on your
relationship with jane,
 And I'll only get
in the way.
 And she was currently
distracting herself
 With a new man.
Good to see you.
 And speaking of complicated,
 Dr. Luisa had been hooking up
 With her stepmother, rose.
 That is, until she fell
off the wagon and disappeared.
 I don't know where you are.
 Oh, and michael
was currently on the hunt
 For the notorious drug dealer
known as sin rostro.
 And honestly, there are
 A gazillion other things
going on.
 But we should just get started,
right?
 As a young girl,
 Jane gloriana villanueva
loved to hear stories.
 Okay, so tell me what happened.
 From the very beginning.
 Well, first the producer said
 He loved my voice.
Then he said
 I had great energy up there.
 Xiomara:
Oh, sorry, ma.
 I didn't mean to wake you.
 Oh, shoot.
 I thought I paid this.
 Mom, it's a parking ticket.
I'll pay the fine.
 So... What is it about?
 I like long stories.
 So what does that have to do
with mom's parking ticket?
 How can I be patient?
 I haven't seen you in two weeks.
 I know, I know.
 I-I miss you, too.
I'm hurrying.
 Latin lover narrator:
Do you know what?
I'm gonna stop right here.
 I should really set the stage.
Fill in some gaps.
 (phone chimes)
ah, yes.
 This is where we left off.
 Rafael, you'll remember,
was about to meet jane, when...
 We've got to talk.
 Dad, not
right now.
 You're fired.
What?
 Why?
 Narrator:
And here's what you didn't see.
 I'm sorry.
 I felt obligated
to tell your father.
 You're jeopardizing
the hotel.
 What the hell
are you talking about?
 The fact that you put up
your shares of the hotel
 For luisa's medical malpractice
insurance.
 I did that, dad,
but come on.
 You're the one
who always says
 Family comes
first, right?
 The problem is,
 Luisa needs to answer
to this lawsuit in two weeks.
 If she doesn't, this waitress...
 Jane.
 Right. Jane.
 Jane could get
a default judgment
 And then lay claim
to your 20% of the marbella.
 Latin lover narrator:
And that led to this.
 (phone rings)
 Hey. Where are you?
 I'm on my way to the airport.
 I have to go to mexico city.
 What? Why?
 It has to do with your lawsuit
 And my sister.
 But, jane, I don't want
to make you uncomfortable.
 Oh. Uh... Church and state,
 We separate everything.
 Don't tell me why
you're going to mexico city
 As someone who's
suing your sister.
 Tell me as...
 Someone who cares about you
 And wants to know why the hell
you're going to mexico city.
 If luisa doesn't come back
in two weeks,
 Then you get a default judgment
against her.
 Latin lover narrator:
I should pause to point out
 That jane had no idea that
rafael's hotel was on the line.
 And he wasn't
about to tell her.
 We have a hacienda
in mexico city.
 I've been tracking
her credit cards.
 Just to make sure she's alive.
 I really hope you find her.
 Latin lover narrator:
And that brings us...
 I'm sorry you didn't find her.
 It was like chasing a ghost.
 A drunk ghost.
 San miguel,
mexico city, tulum...
 Jane:
She probably figures
 Her insurance will take care
of my lawsuit.
 So how was teaching?
 Oh, you know... Uneventful.
 A lot of grading papers.
 Latin lover narrator:
There was one other thing.
 She also spent
a great deal of time
 Hugging churchgoers who thought
she could grant miracles
 Because she was
a pregnant virgin.
 But jane wasn't about
to tell him that.
 I just want to see you.
 I've really missed you.
 I'm here.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 What?
 You're showing.
(laughs)
 Yeah, I am,
a little, right?
 Are you still
feeling good?
 Yeah. Yeah.
 So...
 This is my place.
 Yeah, I've been here,
actually.
 With petra.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes. Petra.
 I'm not gonna lie.
 The last two weeks have been
tough for petra.
 You can't keep ordering
room service.
 When I settle my divorce,
I'm going to have to pay it off.
 Oh, petra, stop.
 We are cooped up
in this tiny room.
 Ivan:
Yeah.
 Oh, stop.
You're no better.
 Latin lover narrator:
Having a hostage
 Was turning into
a major headache.
 Who needs lobster every night?
 (phone ringing)
 Hello?
 Rafael's back.
Here we go.
 No more leaving,
okay?
 Okay.
 I missed you
so much, jane.
 Should we move
to the bedroom?
 Latin lover narrator:
Ah. Now it's time for jane
 To tell him she's a virgin.
 I should
probably go home.
 I have court
tomorrow, so...
 Oh. Uh... Okay.
 Um... Well, can I
take you to dinner?
 To celebrate
your victory?
 Winning a default judgment
against your sister?
 Church and state.
 Maybe afterwards,
you could even...
 Sleep over.
 Latin lover narrator:
Okay, tell him right now.
 And speaking of sleeping over,
 Remember marco,
xo's soccer-playing hottie?
 The past few weeks had been
pretty good for them.
 (crashing)
 Less good, however,
for rogelio.
 Oh. Rogelio. Again.
 Ugh, it's so
annoying.
 He's trying to get
close to jane, so...
 I should
probably head in.
 Oh. But first, eva would
like you to come over
 For an official
family dinner.
 Like with place mats
and everything.
 Sounds good.
 (rattling)
 Bye.
Bye.
 Rogelio:
Oh, hello, xiomara.
 Finished with your date so soon?
 What are you even
doing here again?
 I was actually helping
jane prepare for court.
 I have played many lawyers,
 So I was giving her
lots of tips.
 Ah. Got it.
 Avoiding rogelio
and his legal tips?
 Yeah, something about...
 Putting hand sanitizer
under my eyes,
 So that I can cry.
 Oh...
 So... How was the big
reunion with rafael?
 It was good.
 Uh-oh.
 What happened?
We...
 Had a moment in his penthouse
 Where I could have told him
 That I'm not having sex,
but I didn't.
 Makes sense.
 I don't know how a guy
like that responds.
 Seriously?
What?
 "a guy like that"?
 I'm sorry.
 I-I just don't really
see you two together.
 I mean, you're so different.
You just are.
 Great. Thanks for the talk.
 I feel so much better now.
 Jane, I'm just
being honest,
 Just like you're
honest with me
 When you don't
like someone.
 Rafael's not "someone."
 I'm having his baby.
 You're right.
 Petra:
I heard you were back.
 I live here.
 The question is, why
are you still here?
 Well, I don't really
have any money, do I?
 Till we settle our
divorce, anyway.
 Of course, for the right price,
 I would move on now.
 Were you always a monster?
 Or did you become one
along the way?
 Should we...
Review our courtship?
 I was engaged
to a man I loved.
 Who loved me.
 You were passed over
for a promotion
 And so, to get back at lachlan,
 You set your sights on me.
 So tell me, rafael,
 Who's the monster?
 But you see,
 I had the advantage,
 Because I always knew
you were an entitled playboy
 With a tendency
to self-sabotage.
 And jane will find out
soon enough.
 Don't you dare
mention jane.
 How chivalrous.
 Let's be real.
 You two won't last.
 She's a good girl.
 And... Well...
 We've already established
what you are.
 Mom, hurry up!
 We can't be
late to court!
 Are you not coming, abuela?
 Okay, okay, I'm ready.
 One more
button, ma.
 Got it.
 Okay, so, what's
the procedure?
 The lawyer said
it should be easy.
 Since luisa's not here,
 We'll request
a default judgment.
 A default judgment is
ridiculous, your honor.
 With all due
respect,
 A week is all we're asking.
 Another week?
 Your honor, no.
 That's another week into
my client's unwanted pregnancy.
 This event has derailed
 Her life.
 And dr. Alver is exhibiting
that same recklessness now
 By not answering this claim.
 Luisa:
Actually, no, I'm here.
 Hi!
 I am so sorry that I'm late.
 Judge:
Dr. Alver,
 I presume?
 (chuckles)
 Latin lover narrator:
You're probably wondering
where luisa has been.
 Until a week ago, luisa was
 Drinking tequila,
 Kissing strange women,
 And dancing naked.
 I was lost,
 But, your honor,
 I stand before you here today,
 Ready to accept any punishment
that you deem necessary.
 Judge:
This isn't a sentencing.
 You just have to answer
the petition.
 Oh.
 Well, then I answer it.
 I'm here.
 I do need to consult
with my client.
 Absolutely not.
This is ridiculous.
 (gavel bangs)
she's here to answer
the petition.
 There's no default judgment.
 Dr. Alver,
 This is your last chance.
 Don't worry, your honor.
 I'm back.
 Rafael:
Where the hell were you?
 I chased you all over mexico.
 Yes, I know.
 I was in peru
 On an ayahuasca retreat.
 What the hell is ayahuasca?
 Is that the psychedelic drink
that makes you constantly vomit?
 Exactly, but...
 But it's like you're
vomiting out everything
 That's wrong with your life.
 It's, it's really
difficult to describe,
 But I had a shaman, and I was
guided through this journey,
 And in my journey,
 I saw everything so clearly.
 Latin lover narrator:
Full disclosure, I tried it.
 Did nothing for me.
 What's clear
 Is that you are an addict.
 Yes.
 Exactly.
 But why? Why?
 What was I trying to escape?
 And then it dawned on me.
 Money is the root
of all my problems.
 Latin lover narrator:
Well, money and the fact that
 She inseminated the wrong woman
with rafael's sperm.
 We're gonna talk
about this later.
 I'm glad you're home.
 Thanks, daddy.
 We should talk.
 I would really like that.
 Latin lover narrator:
I should stop here,
 Catch you up on jane
and michael.
 Yep, it's been that awkward.
 You okay?
Don't even have time
to think about her.
 We're hours away from the
biggest moment of our career.
 You sure the shipment's
coming in today?
 You confident in your contact
at the coast guard?
 Yeah.
 Michael, I...
 I get that seeing jane around
every day is hard.
 Nadine, stop.
 We agreed we're just
having fun, right?
 Latin lover narrator:
And by fun, he means this.
 Let's just hope
 The drugs come in and lead us
 To sin rostro.
 Rogelio:
Lemonade?
 In high school,
you only drank lemonade
 When you were feeling sad.
 Well, things aren't going
very well at the moment.
 Latin lover narrator:
With marco, please say
with marco.
 I came by here to see
if they needed me
 To fill any spots
in the lounge,
 But they said
they were all full.
 (sighs)
 Once again,
I'm back to square one.
 Don't worry.
 I believe in you almost as much
 As I believe in myself.
 Thanks, rogelio.
 (zaps)
ow!
Ow!
 Must be my shoes.
 Finest italian leather.
 (chuckles)
 I'm worried.
Dad,
 Luisa actually
doesn't seem crazy.
 A psychedelic drink,
 And she has a
spiritual awakening?
 Idiotic, yes,
 But not clinically crazy.
 I agree with rafael.
 For what it's worth.
 In any case, she's back.
 So I would really like
my job back as well.
 I'll toe the line.
 Fine.
 But you'll answer
to lachlan.
 Okay, got it.
 Hey, lachlan.
 So, I just got an interesting
call from your father.
 Yeah.
 I answer to you now.
 Petra:
Well, to me,
 Actually.
What the hell
 Are you doing here?
 Petra has
some connections
 In miami society.
 She agreed to help us
 Bounce back
from your mishaps.
 I'm not working for petra.
 Oh.
 Hmm.
 I thought your father was
pretty clear about it.
 You answer to me, and...
 Well... This is
 What I want.
 Screw you both.
 Okay, but why would lachlan
want to hire petra?
 'cause he wants to
get under my skin.
 Why?
He was actually engaged to petra
at one point.
 What?
 I kind of...
 Stole her from him.
 Oh.
 Look, I was
a different guy back then.
 I'm reacting.
 At least let me react.
 Your scotch.
 Thank you.
And some chips
 And our spinach-artichoke dip.
 Oh, we didn't
actually order anything.
 They're from that couple
over there.
 They said it was
for jane the virgin.
 Latin lover narrator:
Uh-oh.
 I'm s... Uh, j...
 Jane the virgin?
 Thank you.
 Jane the virgin?
What does that mean?
 Well...
 It's, um...
 It's a web site.
 Do you remember
rogelio's stepdaughters?
 Yeah.
 They started it
to be making fun of me.
 Just say it.
 And the fact that I'm a virgin.
 Which I am.
 (chuckles):
And now a pregnant virgin.
 Huh.
So, the web site--
it went viral, and...
 Now, you know,
some people believe,
 Because I'm a pregnant virgin,
that I can grant miracles.
 Wait, what?
 I can't, just to be clear.
 Uh, wow.
 A virgin?
Yeah.
 Wait, so you and michael
never...
 No.
Not even after you got engaged?
 No. (chuckles)
 Really?
 No!
 (chuckles)
 Not even...
 Rafael?
 I made a promise to my grandma
when I was young
 That I would wait till marriage.
 That's what I've done.
 And that's still your plan?
 Yes.
 Definitely.
 That's... That's...
 That's great.
 (exhales):
Oh, yeah.
 Excuse me.
 You need another drink?
 I'm reacting.
I can react, right?
 Yeah, you're allowed to react.
 Waitress:
Another scotch?
Uh, yes, please.
 It should be noted that michael
did not react like this
 When she told him
she was a virgin.
 But that's
neither here nor there.
 Check that number.
 Nadine:
8-3-2.
 Yeah, that's it.
 You realize this could be
huge for us, right?
 We follow this shipment,
learn where sin rostro
has been hiding.
 Okay, we got to
stay focused.
 We got to stay focused.
Yeah.
 Yeah, you're right.
Michael:
Here we go.
 Look, I'm sorry
I freaked out, okay?
 I'm over it.
It's fine.
 Fine?
 Uh, you just
surprised me,
that's all.
 Yeah, I definitely
got that.
 It's just, it's not something
that you normally hear.
 Not... No, not that
you're not normal.
 It's fine. I get it.
 Fine?
 Yeah, fine.
 Look, it's been a long day--
I just think
 We should call it a night.
Jane...
 Rafael, I'm tired.
 Fine.
 (sighs)
 (loud banging)
what?
 (banging)
 Oh!
 Get down, get down.
 Nadine:
Is that sin rostro?
 Michael:
No way.
 Sin rostro's already
in miami, and we've got
intel to back that up.
 Okay, so maybe
it's his new contact,
 Whoever's taking over
for roman zazo.
 We got to go.
 Hi, babe.
Hey.
 You'll never guess
who called here tonight.
 Elliot lantana.
 He's an actual legitimate
record producer.
 He heard me sing at the club,
 And he wants to record
a demo with me!
 That's amazing, ma.
I know, right?
 Watch out,
paulina rubio!
 Hon?
Hmm?
 How'd it go with rafael?
 Did you tell him you're waiting?
 Come on.
 I got your message
loud and clear.
 I'm on board.
Did you tell him?
 How did he take it?
Well. He took it well.
 Good.
 Mm-hmm.
 I was just
so worried.
 About you.
 I know. I'm sorry.
 (sighs) but how
I felt about you--
 That's part of what
I was running from.
 No, I get that.
 Look, here's the thing.
 When I was in the sweat lodge,
 Drinking my tea,
 Throwing up,
being guided by my shaman,
 I kept... Seeing your face.
 It was a little distorted,
 But... It was you.
 Luisa.
 I came here to be
truthful and honest.
 And if I'm being
truthful and honest...
 I still want to be with you.
 I want us to tell
 Everyone what happened
and just...
 Run away together.
 We can't do that.
 It's over.
 For real, this time.
 (long sigh)
 Ah...
 I had a feeling
you might say that.
 Regardless,
 We still have to tell my father
what happened between us.
 What?
My shaman thinks
it's really important
 For me to just come clean
about all my lies.
 Your shaman doesn't understand
the situation.
 No, he really does.
Luisa,
 It will destroy my marriage.
 Or make it stronger.
 (quietly):
What are you talking about?
Rose...
 I know this is
gonna be hard,
 But trust me, once you do it,
 You're gonna feel
so much better.
 Healthier.
 Don't worry.
 I'll give you time to...
 To figure out how
to break it to him.
 Tell my father.
 Or I will.
 Woman:
Long day?
 Oh, yeah.
 Me, too.
 (chuckles)
 The longest.
 Oh, here, have mine.
 I haven't touched
it, I swear.
 No, that's...
It's fine, thank you.
 Come on, I paid 17 bucks
for this thing.
 I swear, this place is
such a rip-off.
 Thank you.
 Cheers.
 (chuckles)
 Oh.
 (both chuckle)
 What's he doing?
 Well, considering he's at
the front desk getting a key...
 ...I'm gonna go with
checking in.
Thanks, wiseass.
 Makes sense
that he's here;
 This is the hub of the
sin rostro operation.
 Did you get
the picture?
 Yep.
Great.
 I'll get it to my friend at
the fbi to run face recognition.
 You trust
this friend?
Yeah, absolutely.
 (xiomara singing in spanish)
 â™ª this is my life
and this is my turn â™ª
 â™ª chasing the dreams
that I long for â™ª
 â™ª I know that love,
it will conquer... â™ª
 Man:
Stop, stop, stop.
 Stop, stop.
 Here is the problem.
 While you were singing,
I kept wishing I was singing.
 So I need you to get me
out of my head.
 How do I do that?
 Dig deeper, xiomara.
 Dig deeper.
 Oh, just one second,
one second.
 â™ª dig deeper,
deeper, deeper. â™ª
 Sorry, song idea.
 Get me out of my head.
 Understand?
 Okay, let's go
from the top again.
 Jane, can you take some mimosas
up to room 467?
 I don't do room service.
 Well, you served one
of our vip guests the other day,
 And apparently
he's taken a liking to you.
 To be clear,
that's creepy,
 Uh, and I'm not
going into the room.
 Just deliver the mimosas.
 Woman:
Come on in.
 Uh, where can I put this?
 Oh, my...
 Jane.
 Jane.
 Jane!
 Rafael:
Jane! Jane!
 Jane!
 Listen, stop.
 Let me explain.
 I told you I was a virgin,
and you had sex
 With the first girl
you could find.
 That is not true.
 Okay, so then what happened?
 (stammers)
I'm not sure.
 What?
 (stammers)
 I don't remember
anything from last night.
 (scoffs)
 Yeah, that's not
a good explanation.
 What happened last night?
 Oh, you know, the usual.
 Had a couple drinks,
came back here.
 D-did we, uh, did we have sex?
 Come on, yeah.
 Of course we did.
 They're fake, if that's
what you're wondering.
 No, actually wondering
 What my girlfriend is
doing between them.
 Well, thank you so much.
 This has been such a thrill.
 I don't know how I can
ever pay you back.
 You don't need to pay me back.
 When a friend asks me
for a favor, I cannot refuse.
 What friend?
 Rogelio.
 Why else do you think
 We did not make love
in the sound booth?
 It was embarrassing.
 Had he even heard me sing?
 Did he even see
my youtube videos?
 No, he hadn't.
 But I knew once he heard
you, he'd be a fan.
Ugh.
 (electric zap)
oh, come on.
 Latin lover narrator:
A spark.
 Don't be angry.
 It was a nice
thing I did.
 Wasn't it?
 Yeah, it was.
 So, what's
our problem?
 Latin lover narrator:
The fact that she desperately
did not want
 To have feelings for him.
 Nothing.
 There's no problem.
 Hey, aren't you teaching
this afternoon?
 Yeah, I have a few more minutes
before I have to leave.
 Oh, no.
 What happened?
 (sighs)
 You were right
about rafael, okay?
 Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.
 I didn't want
to be right.
 I don't even know
what I was thinking.
 I mean,
we're so different.
 Trust me, hon,
I get it.
 Especially because it would
have been so perfect,
 If it had
worked out.
 Yeah, it really
would have.
 I need to talk to you.
 Is everything okay?
 I don't know.
 I don't know
if I should say something
 Or not say
something.
About what?
 Your sister.
 Well, then you should
definitely say something.
 She is having a
sort of breakdown.
 And I hate
saying this.
 But, given her history
and her mother...
 Rose,
 What happened?
 I went to go see her.
 To check in.
 Rafael, it
was awful.
 The things that she was
saying to me,
 All these... Sexual things.
 And I didn't know
how to respond.
 I didn't know what to do.
 It's okay.
 You did
the right thing
 By coming to me.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ooh, not nice, rose.
 All right, you know
the reading assignment--
 The taming of the shrew.
Enjoy, and I know...
 Student:
Who are you?
 It's really you.
 Jane the virgin.
 All right, that's enough.
 Get moving!
 We met this morning.
 Yes, I recall.
 Right. Look, uh...
 What you think happened,
 It didn't.
 Yeah, I was there.
 Something
obviously happened.
 No, I was paid to drug him and
make it seem like we had sex.
 Latin lover narrator:
Oh, is that all?
 What?
 I'm an escort.
 Uh, my manager
got me the gig.
 It was all online,
I don't even know who set it up.
 Oh, my god.
 Look, I only did it
because it was easy money.
 But then your boyfriend
told me
 That you're jane the virgin,
 And I'm a really
religious woman.
 Which I know is hard
to believe given, you know,
 What I do.
 Anyway,
 I'm really sorry.
 Okay.
 Thank you for
telling me that.
 Yeah.
 So...
 Can I have a hug?
 Excuse me?
 I could really use a miracle.
 I have a son.
 And I haven't seen him
in a while
 Due to a-a couple
of circumstances.
 I've been in some
bad situations, but...
 I really want to see him.
 And maybe if I hug you...
 I don't want
to give you false hope.
 I am not a religious messiah.
 What happened to me was
a medical mistake.
 But can I give
you a hug anyway?
 Yeah.
 I really hope you
get to see your son.
 (speaking spanish)
 They don't actually give awards
out to shows like this, do they?
 Well, y-you can't tell anything
from just one scene, okay?
 There's a...
There's a larger story.
 Anyway,
 They do give out awards,
 And I've actually booked
the afterparty here.
 In the hotel.
 How did you do that?
 One of the divas recovered
from extensive plastic surgery
 In one of our medical
recovery suites.
 I promised that secret
would never get out.
 And I thought you took this job
just to make rafael squirm.
 Well, the better the hotel does,
 The more money I make
in my divorce.
 It's always about money
with you, isn't it?
 Though setting rafael up
with that escort, that...
 That seems personal.
 True.
 I also despise him.
 And leaving you for him was
the biggest mistake of my life.
 Is that what you
want to hear?
 Well, it's true.
 I should get back
to my mother.
 Rafael:
It had to have been petra.
 She's the only person
crazy enough to set me up.
 So crazy.
You know,
 I'm just gonna
expedite her settlement.
 I don't want to deal
with it anymore.
 I want it to end
and I don't want it
 To get in the way of... Us.
 What "us"?
 Come on.
 Last night, our dinner...
 It was awful!
 (laughs)
I know and I'm sorry.
 I freaked out when you
told me you'd never had sex.
 And... I don't know.
 It was unexpected.
 And I acted like an idiot.
 And honestly,
once I thought about it,
 It doesn't even matter.
 You know, I'll wait
as long as I have to...
 I just...
It's not only that.
 Now, look what happened
 When you lost your job and
found out I was a virgin.
 You got to cut me
some slack, jane.
 That was a tough moment.
Yeah.
 Life is full of tough moments.
 You have to fight
for what you want.
 Look, I just think
 That maybe we read
too much into things
 Between us.
 We're having a baby.
 Let's focus on that.
 Latin lover narrator:
And speaking
 Of not working out...
 So, we should nail down a date
for dinner with my daughter.
 Let it be known
 That at that moment,
xiomara prayed for a spark.
 I don't think I should.
 Why?
 Look, you're a great guy.
 And because you're a great guy,
 I wanted it to work out.
 So I've been
ignoring the fact
 That there's
something missing here.
 What's going on?
 Please... Sit down, luisa.
 Who are you?
 My name is dr. Perez.
 Emilio:
Try to stay calm, luisa.
 What?
 What's going on?
 I'm so sorry, luisa.
 I had to tell them
what you were saying.
 Tell them what?
 About... Us?
 Ah... You mean our affair?
 See?
 Luisa?
 You're having
some sort of episode.
 Fantasizing about me.
 What?!
 What?!
 Luisa, you got to stay calm.
We were, we were lovers!
 I don't know what happened.
Rafael:
The doctor has
 Medications to give you.
She's lying!
 She's lying! Stop lying!
 I don't know what I did
to trigger this...
 The same thing happened
with her mother--
 A psychotic break.
 Stop lying! Stop lying!
 (all clamoring)
 Why are you lying?!
 Why are you doing this?!
 Stop!
Stop lying!
 Why are you doing this?!
 Oh!
Stop lying!
 Please!
 Liar!
 Emilio:
I have no choice.
 I have to commit her.
 Abuela, you ready for the
world premiere of mom's song?
 Oh, sorry.
 Whenever you're ready,
we'll head to the hotel.
 (whispers):
Mom.
 Is everything okay with abuela?
 She's in there
with the rosary again.
 Oh.
What is it?
 It's your lawsuit.
 Remember that time I forgot
to pay my parking ticket?
 I wasn't even thinking about
how she feels about court.
 If grandpa's family was so rich,
 Why aren't we rich?
 Why?
 Stupid immigration laws.
 And I get that, ma.
 And I'll be more careful.
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted
 That was the last ticket
 Xiomara ever got.
 Oh, I didn't even think.
 It's just a civil procedure.
 Yeah, and she knows that.
 And she's fine with it.
 But then petra started
acting all crazy,
 And the family's
so powerful...
 She's just nervous,
that's all.
 Wanted to see me?
 Yeah, go ahead and shut that.
 So, I've been thinking...
 About how you said
you made a mistake.
 And I agree.
 You did.
 (passionate moaning)
 Lachlan, I-I don't...
 Wait.
 I'm deleting it.
 I never stopped
missing you.
 (cell phone dings)
 I got an I.D.
On the picture I sent.
 The guy's a possible
serbian war criminal.
 What?
 What the hell does a serbian
have to do with sin rostro?
 I don't know.
 The guy's been awfully
quiet in there.
 I don't like this.
 (phone rings)
(sighs)
 Hello?
 Uh, no.
Yeah, this is rafael.
 What?
 All right, I'm gonna
go have luca put this on
 And you guys
grab a seat.
 Okay.
Oh, rogelio's here.
 I invited him to hear it.
 Since he's the one who set up
the recording session.
 Mm-hmm.
 Come on, ma.
Okay.
 (speaks spanish)
 Xiomara.
 So, where's mark?
 You mean marco?
 Is that not what I said?
 We broke up.
 But in case you were
thinking it had anything
 To do with you...
Latin lover narrator:
It did. And he was.
 ...It didn't.
 Just because he wasn't right
doesn't mean you are.
 Of course.
I agree 100%.
 (music playing)
 Ah.
 Is that your song?
 Just beautiful.
 (petra moaning)
 Latin lover narrator:
Hmm.
 I guess he didn't delete it
after all.
 Housekeeping.
 He's gone.
 What the hell?
 Where'd he go?
 Jane.
 Did petra talk to you?
 Is that why you
withdrew the lawsuit?
What?
 No, I just got a...
I got a call from my lawyer
 Saying that you withdrew.
 I did, but that wasn't
because of petra.
 It was... It was...
 It was for my grandma.
 She's not a legal
resident in this country,
 And the whole thing was
making her nervous.
 And it's not only that.
 I was thinking about
 What my lawyer said in court,
 About how this baby
was not wanted.
 And I don't feel
like that anymore.
 So what am I doing this for,
really-- for the money?
 'cause that just feels ugly.
 Especially because
you are absolutely
 Going to take care of your
child, financially.
 Of course I am.
 I'm gonna need that in writing.
 Done.
 Wait, wh... What was it that
you thought petra told me?
 Latin lover narrator:
And so rafael
 Finally told jane the truth.
 I... Underwrote my sister's
 Medical malpractice insurance.
 So your lawsuit...
 You were actually suing me.
 What?
 I-I just didn't want to
 Affect your decision to sue.
 I had no idea.
 I know.
 I've also been thinking
about what you told me.
 About how I need
to fight for things.
 And you're right.
I do.
 So I'm gonna
work for lachlan.
 And petra,
as long as she's here.
 And I'm gonna fight
for you, too.
 Jane, this-this is...
This is hard.
 Look, we're doing
everything backwards.
 I mean, we're having
a baby and-and then
 We're going on our first date?
 But I want to be with you.
 And I'm not giving up.
 Latin lover narrator:
Oh, if only it were that easy.
