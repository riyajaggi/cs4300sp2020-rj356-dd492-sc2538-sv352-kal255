 Latin lover narrator:
Is this thing on? Okay, good.
(thumping)
 Hi, friends. Let's jump
right in. As you know, jane was
 Accidentally inseminated
with rafael's sperm.
 But I've never had sex.
 And, wow, a lot
has happened since then.
 First, jane and rafael
discovered the truth
 About his ex-wife
petra's identity.
 She's not who she says she is.
 Natalia.
Jane: Turns out the real petra,
 Well, she died
in the czech republic in 2008.
 Latin lover narrator:
Meanwhile, tensions between
jane's ex-fiancÃ© michael
 And her current flame
rafael were at
 An all-time high, and jane
was caught in the middle.
 Something's going on
with him-- something shady.
 Latin lover narrator:
See, michael was convinced
 Rafael was involved
with sin rostro,
 A big, bad drug dealer.
 He thought he had a lead,
but it evaporated.
 We lost a serbian
war criminal.
 Listen, I have a theory.
Sin rostro went underground
 Around the same time
rafael got cancer.
 As soon as rafael's better
and takes over the hotel,
 Sin rostro resurfaces
and there are two murders.
 Where's your evidence?
Latin lover narrator:
So he broke into
 Rafael's office,
where he found this.
 Unfortunately, when he
went back, with a warrant,
 The safe was empty.
And then this happened.
 It was an omg moment, right?
 And to make matters worse,
 A tropical storm
is heading their way.
 It should be noted
that at an early age,
 Jane gloriana villanueva
was already
 A quick learner
with many skills.
 100 in math,
 100 in social studies,
98 in spelling,
 But that's because
I used the british spelling
 Of "amphitheater," so I think
I can argue that tomorrow.
 Xiomara: Great job, hon.
Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that
 Xiomara gloriana villanueva
was also
 A very quick learner
with many skills.
 Unfortunately, cooking
was not one of them.
 Thank you.
 "ask your parent
 To cook a dish
from the country you're from."
 Hey, honey, why didn't you
tell me about this?
 Latin lover narrator:
Because she was going to ask
alba to cook for heritage day.
 I forgot.
 It'll be fun.
 Maybe I'll make, like,
a chicken empanada or an arepa?
 (gasps)
young jane: Abuela?
 Can you teach me how to pray?
 Like, the right way,
with your rosary?
 I just want heritage day
to go well.
 Mom's cooking,
 And I don't want anyone
to get seriously sick.
 Latin lover narrator:
And from that moment on,
 When jane felt
especially desperate,
 She would often
turn to prayer.
 (thunder rumbling)
 And jane needed
the power of prayer now
 More than ever.
 (mouthing)
 Hi, ms. Villanueva?
 Yes.
Yes.
 She's my mother,
her grandma.
 What's going on?
How is she?
 Well, the good news
is she's stable.
 And she gives every indication
that she will wake up.
 Okay, so what's
the bad news?
 We don't know when that will be.
 There was some
internal bleeding caused by
 The head injury.
And until she does wake up,
 We won't know whether
there will be
 Any long-term
ramifications.
 Like, you mean
her memory? Or...
 That, among
other things--
 Speech, certain skills.
 All we can do is wait.
 Okay. Thank you.
 Thanks.
 She would want
us to pray.
 What?
 Abuela.
 Where's her rosary?
 I don't know.
 No, I saw her put it
in her purse
 Before we went
to the awards show.
 It must've fallen out
when she fell.
 Okay, I'm gonna
go to the hotel to get it.
 Come on, jane.
 There's a tropical storm
outside.
 Mom, do you remember
when I was applying
 To get my teaching degree
and she prayed with the rosary
 That I'd get in?
 Two days later, I got in.
 Because you're smart,
not because of some beads
 She got at a church flea market.
 Mom, I can't just
sit around and do nothing.
 Okay? I'll take the car--
 Ten minutes there,
ten minutes back.
 Please?
 Okay, let me know
if anything changes.
 (thunderclap)
 Latin lover narrator:
You'll recall we last
left michael and nadine
 In a rather exciting position.
 Not that one, you perv.
 They had discovered
sin rostro's
 Secret tunnel
beneath the hotel.
 You sure we shouldn't
call for backup?
 The serbian could
still be down here.
 We don't even know where
this tunnel leads.
 Hold up.
(whispers): Whoa.
 It's a retinal scanner.
 This must be where
sin rostro keeps the drugs.
 We got to get inside.
 Agreed.
 Let's call for backup
 And bust through this thing.
 Lachlan is stuck
in key largo.
 Oh, that's too bad.
Yes, it is,
 Because I have to head out.
 The storm's really
picking up, darling.
 Maybe you shouldn't fly.
 I have to; it's-it's important.
 Then don't worry.
 I can handle the marbella
in your absence.
 Come on, dad.
I've done it before.
 And your tenure
wasn't that successful.
 And I've learned
from my mistakes.
 Come on, you have
proven your point.
 Just give me a chance.
 There's a lot
to do right now.
 The storm is picking up.
We got to prepare the hotel,
 We have to relocate patients
from their recovery suites
 To hospital in case
our generators fail.
 Just let me get started.
 Please.
 All right.
 One thing.
 Lachlan was about to institute
 15% layoffs
across all departments
 To offset our losses.
 Now you can do it.
 It's only fair,
 Since it was
your mistakes that put us
 In this spot
in the first place.
 Will that be a problem?
 No. Not at all.
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that,
 Despite the unpleasant task,
 Rafael found himself
briefly optimistic.
 Hello, rafael.
Latin lover narrator: Yup.
 Briefly.
 What do you want, petra?
 Or... Whatever your name is.
 Latin lover narrator:
Natalia, actually.
 Look, I didn't
come here to fight.
 The divorce papers.
 I signed them.
 You won.
 And I'll leave as soon
as you pay out my prenup.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes, her prenup.
 Petra's golden ticket.
 Here's the thing
about the prenup.
 Petra andel signed it.
 You're not petra andel.
 Rafael, please.
I have nothing.
 And you deserve nothing.
Yes, I know.
You're right.
 Let me at least tell you
the truth about everything.
 I lied about my identity
 Because I've been running
for a very long time
 From a very evil man.
 Yeah, so here's the problem.
 I don't believe you.
 It's the truth.
 Should we go over
all the crazy lies
 And the things you've done
just in the last six months?
 'cause we can.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ooh, yes, let's.
 Rafael, listen...
 Man (over p.A.):
Attention guests and staff.
 Tropical storm florentina
has gained speed and is now
 A category 2 hurricane.
 Authorities tell us
the roads will soon be closed.
 For your own safety,
please stay indoors.
 Latin lover narrator:
Uh-oh. Jane still hadn't
found alba's rosary.
 Jane?
 I found this
when I was cleaning up.
 I heard you were
looking for it.
 It felt like a miracle.
 Oh, my god. Thank you, regina.
I owe you big-time.
 Hey, you taught my gaby
how to make the best
 Grilled cheese
on the planet.
 It's the least I could do.
(chuckles)
 (thunder rumbling)
 Please stay off the roads
and in your homes.
 The national weather service
has upgraded this...
 Wow! I have to say, the wind
is really picking up out here!
 Emilio: I told you,
I have no choice.
 I'm getting out
before the storm hits.
 The move is next week.
 I'll need five
million for allegria.
 Darling. I didn't
know you were awake.
 Oh, I couldn't sleep,
with the wind.
 You sounded upset.
Is everything all right?
 Yes, yes. It's my driver, he's
just waiting for me downstairs.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ooh. That didn't sound
like his driver.
 Do you really
have to go tonight?
 Yes, I do. But I'm gonna call
you as soon as I get to prague.
 And next week, you and me,
we're going away together.
 So you two found this
 Hydraulic bathtub...
 How, exactly?
 Just good old-fashioned
detective work.
 Well, great job.
 Thank you.
(phone ringing)
 Hey.
 Okay, we're on our way.
 They got through
the lock.
 What the hell?
 Maybe sin rostro
 Kills people here
from rival cartels.
 Looks more like a...
 Surgical room.
 Yeah, but why the hell does
sin rostro need a surgical room?
 Make sure all the outdoor
furniture is moved inside.
 The wind will toss everything.
And get those storm shutters up,
 And remember,
first sign of flooding,
 We kill the main breaker.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?
 I thought you were
at the hospital.
No, no, I...
 I came to grab my grandmother's
rosary. I have to get back.
 No, the roads are really bad.
No, but it's close.
 You are pregnant.
If something were to happen...
 Hey, make an announcement.
It's no longer safe for anyone
 To leave the hotel.
The marbella is now on lockdown.
 I know you want to go,
but it's not safe, okay?
 Not until the road clears.
No, you're right.
I'm gonna call my mom.
 I-I got to go talk to them.
Do you want to wait out
the storm in my penthouse?
 No, no, no. I'm gonna find
my friends, see how I can
help. Go. I'll figure it out.
 Go, go, go, go.
Just-just text me
if you need anything.
 Okay.
 Okay, so this room
 Is also connected to the hotel's
medical recovery suites.
 There were
five patients
 Registered there
as of this afternoon.
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted
that michael and nadine
 Are thinking
the same exact thing.
 Where are the patients?
 They were relocated
to holy crown hospital
 Before the hurricane hit.
What?
 Apparently, the guy
that runs the hotel
 Did it as a precaution.
 Rafael solano?
 Yeah.
Head over to
holy crown.
 I don't care if those
roads are closed.
 We need those patients
identified immediately.
 Got it.
 It's rafael. I knew it.
Okay, just calm down
 And let's think this through.
He ran this hotel.
 He knows everything
that happens here.
 There's no way he didn't know
about this place.
 Nadine,
think about it.
 Roman zazo,
one of sin rostro's contacts,
 Was rafael's college roommate.
 Then there's the
multiple passports
from different countries,
 Cash and burner phone
inside his safe...
 Which we never found.
 I know what I saw.
 You know me
well enough to know
 I would not make that up.
 He must have moved them.
 Look, rafael is definitely
a suspect, okay?
 But if he's involved,
I got to think
 He's working for his father.
I mean,
 Emilio is the one
that financed the hotel.
 And zazo was murdered
the same night
 That emilio got here.
 Either way,
rafael's involved.
 I bet the retinal scanner
recognizes him.
 The tech had to break the
scanner to get through the door.
 (sighs)
 Then I'm gonna
go rattle his cage.
 (thunderclap)
 Okay, I've seen titanic,
like, a hundred times.
 Nobody cares about
the third-class passengers.
 We're gonna get locked
in here and drown.
 Okay, you do know we're
not actually on a boat,
 Right?
Guys.
 What's wrong? Oh, my god,
I knew it. I had a bad feeling.
 I just heard from housekeeping
carla, who's dating that bellboy
 Whose sister works in hr,
that people are getting fired.
 Like, a lot
of people.
 (thunderclap)
(gasps)
 During a hurricane?!
 Oh! Jane, jane,
jane, come here.
 Jane: Sorry, I was
just changing.
 I've been looking for you guys.
 Frankie heard
cuts are coming.
 Will you ask rafael
if it's true
 And who's getting fired?
 Oh, I-I don't think
that's a good idea.
 Oh, please, jane?
I need this job.
 I drink for free,
and it's so close to my gym.
 Yeah, I don't think I can use
that argument with rafael.
 Why?
I-I don't want to take advantage
of our relationship.
 Luca:
Come on, jane.
 I just moved into a new place.
 If I can't pay rent,
I will literally
 Be homeless.
You guys, it's fine.
 Don't pressure her.
 We just need
a heads up.
 Okay. All right.
I'll talk to him.
 But he's been busy, so I-I'll
just wait till I see him later.
 Okay, well, he's over there
talking to your ex-fiancÃ©,
 Right there.
 I told you, I don't know
anything about secret tunnels
 And I want to see them.
And I told you
I don't believe you.
 And you can't see them--
it's a potential crime scene.
 Hey. Hey there.
What are you guys talking about?
 Uh, we're actually discussing
police business.
 I assume you don't
want her to stay.
 She can absolutely stay.
 Okay, so what am I
staying for exactly?
 We discovered a secret tunnel
underneath the marbella.
 It leads to
a surgical room,
 Connecting to
the recovery suites,
 Which we believe is connected
to a criminal enterprise.
 What kind
of criminal enterprise?
 There's a big drug dealer.
 He's known as sin rostro.
 The man without a face?
Yes.
 No one's I.D.'d him,
but we have reason to believe
 He's based here;
the most obvious reason being
 That two of his known
associates were murdered
 In the marbella.
 Exactly.
 The police
should have solved it.
 Do your job.
 I am.
 Right now.
 For the record,
you're claiming
 You have no connection
to any of this?
 For the record? Of course not.
 Latin lover narrator:
For the record, michael
is really enjoying this.
 Just like those passports
and the burner phone
 Weren't inside your safe?
 Listen, I've already told
you everything I know,
 And this is all
very upsetting.
 And now I'm gonna have
to hire my own security firm
 Until you figure out
how to catch this guy.
 Jane.
 Excuse me, detective.
 What was all that about?
 That was your ex-fiancÃ©
trying to make me look bad.
 Petra:
Mother, enough.
 Look, it's bad enough
my whole life is falling apart.
 You don't have to ride me
every second of the day, okay?
 (sighs)
look, we have to move on.
 And I have a plan.
 Oh. I'm all ears.
 I'll sell my wedding ring,
the rest of my jewelry.
 I'll be able to afford
a little place, a one-bedroom.
 Oh, yeah. Well,
what about him?
 (thunder rumbling)
 Look, h-how about we let
the bygones be bygones?
 You all have been
very nice to me.
 You could let me go.
 I will not tell milos.
I promise.
 Would make things easier.
 Petra, don't be idiot.
 We'd need two-bedroom.
 Wait, what? I can't hear you.
 I know.
The reception is spotty.
 How's grandma?
 The same.
 I'm just sitting here
 With a big pile of forms
that I wish you could fill out.
 I know. I'll be there
as soon as I can.
 Yeah, because...
(thunder rumbling)
 Damn it.
 Woman:
El presidente.
 How did you even get here
with the storm?
 I pulled some strings.
I got a police escort.
 (sobs)
 What's that?
 Oh. It's a swag bag.
 From the after-after party.
 I'm so glad you're here.
 Of course I'm here.
 We're family,
and nothing is more important.
 I'm sorry.
So many designer gifts.
 It's hard to find
what you're looking for.
 (sniffles)
 Oh, no. What's wrong?
 We're all getting fired.
That's it, isn't it?
 You can tell us
the truth.
 Jane had completely forgotten
about the layoffs.
 I totally flaked.
 I'm sorry.
 There's a lot going on.
 Jane was about to tell them
about her grandmother.
 Right.
But then lina did that.
 Did you just roll your eyes
at me, dude?
 It just seems like maybe
you're not in a big rush
 To find out if we're getting
fired because obviously
 You're not getting fired.
 Wait, what does that mean?
I could be.
 Really? Your boyfriend's
gonna fire you?
 You know, probably not.
 But that's because I've taken
three sick days in four years,
 And I've been twice voted
employee of the month.
 You keep telling yourself that.
 Look,
all lina's saying
 Is... You're in a slightly
different situation now.
 You've got a rich dad suddenly
and a rich baby daddy.
 We just don't have
 The same kind of safety net.
 Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
 Thank you.
 Bad time?
 No, come in.
 I was just getting an update
from our maintenance department.
 (thunder rumbling)
 Is everything okay?
 Yeah.
 It's just, uh...
My friends heard
 That there are gonna be layoffs,
and they're freaking out.
 And I hate to ask this,
but is it true?
 Yes.
 Unfortunately.
 My dad wants to...
 Institute a 15% cut
across the board.
 So I've just been up here
trying to make a list.
 Latin lover narrator:
A list which jane
absolutely did not want to see.
 Can I see it?
 You really think
that's... Appropriate?
 Probably not.
 Yes. Good answer, jane.
 But I feel like I have to
because of my friends.
 Oy.
 Okay.
 If it's that important to you.
 Ms. Villanueva,
 There's no easy way to say this.
 Oh, no.
 Did the test results...
No, no.
 Her condition remains unchanged.
 Look, the hospital's
cracking down...
On what?
 Your mother
is in this country illegally.
 She has no insurance.
 And the hospital cannot afford
to absorb the cost of her care.
 I-I don't understand.
What does that mean?
 That when the hurricane lifts,
we will have to notify ice,
 And they will deport her
to venezuela,
 Where she can continue
to receive care if she needs.
 What? That can't be legal.
 It's called
medical repatriation.
 Frankie:
No.
 I can't lose this job.
I don't have anything saved.
 Can't you ask rafael
to not fire me?
 Frankie, I...
 When you were tired and
needed someone to cover
those shifts, I did it.
 And you know I hate this. I
fought for you to get this job.
 You did. But now you can't even
fight to help me keep it?
 It's not my place.
 Wow. You have changed.
 Latin lover narrator:
The truth is, jane didn't know
quite what to do.
 But she figured she could talk
to rafael about it,
 To clear her conscience
and get back to normal.
 Hold the elevator!
 Okay.
 Hey.
 Are you following me?
 I am in the middle
of an investigation, jane.
 (clears throat)
and, yes, I am following you.
 But only because I'm worried.
Something bad's
 Going on here, and it has
to be connected to rafael.
 Michael, what
are you doing?
I saw the passports and phone
 Inside his safe myself.
Stop. Can you just stop?
 (loud clang)
 What was that?
That, my dear,
 Is the classic telenovela trope
 Known as the "stuck
in the elevator" scenario,
 In which two characters at odds
are... Stuck in an elevator.
 Seriously?
 What?
 I did not do this.
 This cannot be happening
right now.
 Oh, it's happening.
 (groans)
in the dark.
 Latin lover narrator:
Please note, michael was
usually very good
 At breaking the tension
in awkward situations.
 So, does this qualify as
mood lighting? (chuckles)
 I said "usually."
 Nope.
 (groans)
 Well, I radioed nadine.
 She's letting
maintenance know.
 Woman (over radio):
...Rapid development
 Of a mid-city
apartment building fire...
 Wow. Impressed you even
made it up that hill.
 (thunder rumbling)
I'm here to see luisa alver.
 I'm her stepmother.
 Latin lover narrator:
That's one way to put it.
 (thunderclap)
 ...Of north baird street
and business loop 269.
 Residents of the 12-story
grayson apartment building...
 We have a visitor here
for luisa.
 You know what?
It's been a while.
 I should stop
and catch you up on luisa.
 Surprisingly, luisa had
actually been enjoying her time
 In the mental hospital.
 She got three balanced meals
a day, plus dessert.
 She thrived under the stability
of a regular routine.
 And best of all, her roommate
was a really great listener.
 And then my shaman was like,
 "you're finally seeing the
world through your third eye."
 (thunder rumbling)
 Luisa. Hi.
 What are you doing here?
 (whispers):
It's rose.
 I need to see you.
 I feel so terribly
about what happened.
 What I did.
 Latin lover narrator:
That was true.
 Rose did feel terrible
about what happened.
 It was not, however,
the real reason she came.
 Look, you were
threatening to tell
 About our affair,
and I panicked.
 I just panicked,
and I feel... So ashamed.
 I mean, I'm an adult,
and it's 2015,
 And I'm not ready to admit
that I want to be with a woman.
 That I want to be with you.
 I just have such a nice life
with your father.
 Good.
 Go back to it.
 Luisa, please. I... I haven't
been able to sleep.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 I'm in a mental institution.
 Do you realize what your father
 Would put us through
if he found out?
 You could have
broken up with me.
 You didn't have to commit me!
 Luisa, please...
Get out of here!
 Now!
 (thunder rumbling)
 Magda:
Petra?
 Are you back yet
with the t.P.?
 Jane:
Rafael must know
 That the elevators
are stuck.
 He'll send someone.
 Right. Nothing ever happens
in this hotel
 Without rafael
knowing about it.
 Stop.
The tunnels,
the murders.
 Please, stop, please!
 I'm just done.
 Between my friends
and my grandma
 Unconscious in
the hospital...
 What?
 Yeah. She fell.
 Is it bad?
 They say she may wake up,
but they don't know...
 If she'll have
permanent damage.
 I am so sorry.
 Is, um...Is your mom...
Is your mom with her?
 But the last time I talked
to them, I lost reception,
 And I haven't heard
from them in a while.
 Um, there's a cop
in the hospital.
 I'll see if I can
reach him on the radio
 And get your mom
on the line.
 (static crackles)
really?
 Thank you.
 She hasn't even
opened her eyes yet,
 And they want
to deport her?
 I mean, how can
they do this?
 Xiomara, I will figure this out.
If my fame and money
 Cannot help keep
your mother in this country,
 Then what is it all for?
 Back off, buddy! You're not
taking my mother anywhere!
 You have a call.
Push to talk.
 Hello?
 Mom, it's me.
 (sighs)
 How is she?
 Physically, no change.
 What is it?
What's going on?
 Okay, yeah.
I love you, mom.
 (static crackles)
 What's going on?
 The hospital knows that
my grandma doesn't have papers.
 She can be deported.
 (thunder rumbling)
how dare she?
 How dare she?
You know what I mean?
 How dare she just...
 Just come in here
and expect me...
 (door creaks open)
 (thunderclap)
 Mother? Mother?!
 Mother?!
 Mother?!
 Ivan:
Hello, petra.
 Let us talk.
 You give me
 The rest of your jewelry,
 And I will not
kill your mother.
 Latin lover narrator:
Petra knew that ivan's gun
 Was inside that drawer.
 What she didn't know
 Was if she could
get to it in time.
 Go ahead. I know
you're probably going
 To kill her anyway.
Petra!
 You would rather me
kill your mother
 Than part with your jewelry?
 I need to start over.
 And you've seen the way
she speaks to me.
 (magda yells, ivan grunts)
 Magda:
Kill him, petra.
 (grunts)
 Now what?
 (mouthing)
 It's my grandma's rosary.
 Oh. The one you used
before heritage day?
 Dear god, please, please,
let heritage day go well.
 Latin lover narrator:
And a few days later...
 Mom, these are amazing.
 Jane knew
her prayer had worked.
 I forgot I told you that story.
 Yeah.
 I haven't been around as much.
 With everything going on--
the pregnancy
 And the teaching job--
 I just haven't been around
as much.
 She knows you love her.
 I'm sorry.
 Come here.
Come here. It's okay.
 (elevator hums,
elevator bell dings)
 Are-are you okay?
 Um, let me know if you hear
anything about your abuela.
 Uh, I got to get back.
 I will. Thank you.
 Rogelio:
Okay. I left word
 With the un ambassador
and gloria estefan.
 One of them will
stop the deportation.
 Most probably
gloria estefan.
 I should hear
back shortly.
 Thank you.
 (thunder rumbling)
 I wasn't the daughter
she wanted, you know?
 I wasn't good or religious.
 She loves you
very much, xiomara.
 I'm certain of that.
 Oh, god, I must look
like a mess right now.
 Here. Have some concealer.
 Wow. That swag bag
really does have everything.
 This is mine. I always
carry it, just in case.
 (thunder rumbling)
 Rafael:
Everything okay?
 I wanted to talk
to you about frankie.
 Look, I looked up your
friend. She's a new hire.
 And she's been late a lot.
(electricity crackling)
 It's just...
 We go way back,
and she's got nothing saved.
 And I just got
my job back,
 And I have
to get the books in order,
 And what you're asking me
to do is...
 It-it's out of line.
 I know.
 And I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't important.
 (sighs)
 The next person
on the list is...
 Regina johnson.
 Jane:
Oh, no, no, no, no.
 She's got two kids,
and she's always so sweet.
 It's either frankie
or it's regina.
 These things are never easy,
but they have to be done.
 Mr. Solano?
Coming.
 Check the circuit breaker.
 I would have left,
but the roads are closed.
 Get out!
Luisa,
 Please just let me say
one thing to you.
 I'm sorry.
 And I love you.
 And... Here.
 Latin lover narrator:
You'll recall,
powdered sugar donuts are
 Rose and luisa's
post-coital go-to snack.
 You think this makes up
for you locking me up?
 No, no. I can't...
 I can't make that up to you.
 But I can do other things.
 (gasps)
 Aah. That hurts.
 That's the point.
 Look, I'm gonna tell your
father the truth about us.
 I will.
 (sighs):
It's just...
 Now is not a good time.
 He's been
so on edge lately.
 Have you ever heard
of somebody named allegria?
 That's my grandmother
on my mom's side.
 My dad really loved her.
 Latin lover narrator:
Rose wondered why emilio
 Would be spending money
on a dead woman.
 He even named his house
in croatia after her.
 Ah, yes.
 You see, this is
the information rose came for.
 God...
 It's me, xo.
 Yeah, I know
it's been a while.
 Jane's not here.
She went to get her rosary,
 The one she used to pray that
I wouldn't mess up heritage day.
 So, I heard
you and jane
 Talking about how she's scared
I'll mess up the food.
 Can you make it?
 I don't want
to embarrass her.
 But, ma!
 Mom, these are amazing!
 See?
 That's my mom.
 She's always there.
 Even though
 I've made loads of mistakes,
she's always there.
 Help her, please.
 And in exchange...
 I'll live a better life.
 More... Godlike and all that.
 And maybe it was a coincidence,
alba waking up as xo prayed.
 Or maybe it really was
a miracle.
 I'll live a chaste life.
 But the facts remain--
alba did wake up.
 And I won't let a man
between these legs again
 Without a ring.
 Not that she'd
let xiomara know that.
 Okay... Thanks for
hearing me out.
 (gasps):
You're awake! Oh, my god!
 Because sometimes faith
needs a little nudge.
 My mom!
She's awake!
 Okay?
 Do you remember
the accident, ma?
 All right, well,
her vitals look good,
 And the swelling has gone down.
 Xiomara:
Oh, thank god.
 I think it's safe to say
that there's no sign
 Of any long-term damage.
 But we will run tests
to make certain.
 Now, as to the other matter...
 Oh. Please...
 Not here.
 Apparently, it has gone away.
 You must have friends
 In high places.
 Anyway, I was glad to hear it.
 In this moment,
xiomara wanted to kiss rogelio
 For what he had done.
 But then she remembered
her promise to god
 About keeping her legs closed
and all.
 Thanks...
For everything.
 A-as much as I'd like
to take credit,
 This wasn't my doing.
 Frankie:
Hi. Well,
 I guess I can finally say
I "stayed" at the marbella.
 (chuckles)
 So, look, I, uh...
 I talked to rafael.
 I'm sorry, frankie,
there's nothing I can do.
 Nothing you can do?
 If it's not you,
it's someone else.
Wow.
 What's going on?
I'm fired.
 What?
 Luca:
Come on,
 Let's get some breakfast.
 (phone ringing)
 Mom? How's abuela?
 Thank god.
 Hey. Going home
to crash?
 Mm, can't. I got to take
the kids to school.
 I swear, they drain all
the life out of you.
(chuckles)
 Oh, um... But
they're worth it.
 Oh... (laughs)
they are... They
are so worth it.
 Thank you.
 I owe you an apology.
 I put you in
a terrible situation.
 Thank you.
 I appreciate that.
 Can I ask you a question?
 Sure.
 I wasn't on that list.
 Of course not.
 Because of my stellar record
as a waitress?
 Uh, yes.
 Because we're having a baby?
 It would be weird if
I fired you, don't you think?
 Probably.
 I just have to accept the fact
that things have changed,
 That I've changed,
just like my friends said.
 You have not changed.
Okay? You would have never
 Gotten someone else fired
in frankie's place.
 No, of course not.
 But, like, in other ways.
 I'm different now.
 And I see babies,
and I find myself
 Trying to guess their age.
 What?
 I-I...
 I do that, too.
 And I am always so off,
by the way.
 Oh, my god, me, too!
 Come here.
 Rafael solano's prints weren't
found anywhere in that room.
 But here are the patient records
from the recovery suites.
 (sighs)
 â™ª
 Michael:
They were performing
 Plastic surgery
on criminals in this room.
 Changing their faces.
 What?
Microscopic bone fragments
were found on the floor.
 That had to come from
cutting into facial bones.
 If you're performing boob jobs
or harvesting organs,
 You're not cutting
through bone.
 Oh, my god.
The silicone we found
 Could have been for... For
chin or-or cheek implants.
 Exactly. Then I found this
in the recovery suite.
 Patient 3-2-0.
 Look at the two x-rays.
They were taken 12 hours apart.
 Same patient, but you can see
their facial structure
 Is slightly different
post-surgery.
 These were taken the same day
the serbian disappeared.
 Could he be patient 3-2-0?
 Talk to me,
talk to me.
 Is he there?
 He must have signed himself out
when the roads reopened
 About an hour ago.
 We have his picture--
we can send out
 An apb with his face on it.
 Don't bother.
 That is not his face anymore.
 I'll sell my jewelry.
 We'll be okay.
 I'd say we got
 48 hours before milos finds out
 Where we are,
 And then the real storm begins.
 The aluminum windows should
have withstood the hurricane.
 If they need repairs,
we'll have to talk
 To the contractor, but
I went over every square inch
 Of the renovation plans
with him.
 Nothing ever happens
in this hotel
 Without rafael knowing about it.
 Hey.
Hi.
 Are you ready
to go see your grandma?
 Yeah. Thanks for driving me.
 Of course.
 What's wrong?
 Look, I-I'm...
 I'm sorry to even ask this,
but the passports
 And the phone that michael said
he saw in your safe,
 Did he just make that all up?
 No. Not all of it.
 I do keep cash in there,
 And I needed
an international phone
 When I traveled
to find luisa.
 And I heard
that michael
 Was snooping around,
so I moved it.
 Look,
 The guy's got it in for me.
 He's trying to get in your head,
and he clearly has,
 Because you are
standing in front of me
 Thinking that I might be
some kind of bad guy.
 That I might have something
to do with this...
 Crazy sin rostro.
 I know you don't.
 I'm sorry I even asked.
 Please don't let michael
get between us.
 No. I won't.
 (chuckles)
 Latin lover narrator:
Remember when I said luisa
 Had been enjoying her time
in the mental hospital?
 That was certainly true.
 However, she enjoyed
her freedom much, much more.
 â™ª
 Hey, betty,
 Do you know anything
about picking locks?
 Rose? What's going on?
You sounded upset.
 I am.
 Rafael, it's your father.
 I'm worried he's involved
in something criminal.
 Wait, what?
 I heard him on the phone
 Taking five million
out of his account
 And secretly planning
to move to allegria,
 His house in croatia.
 I think he's going to try
to flee the country.
 Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Why do
you think he would try to flee?
 What if your father
 Is sin rostro?
 (phone beeps)
 Detective cordero.
 Michael,
 It's xo.
 Oh, hey.
 How's alba?
 Much better, thanks to you.
 What do you mean?
 (sighs)
come on, you're the only one
 Besides jane and rogelio
 Who knew that alba was
in trouble with deportation.
 This is detective cordero with
the miami police department.
 We need a patient of yours,
alba villanueva.
 She is a very important witness
in an ongoing investigation.
 Well, please don't tell jane.
 She'll think I did it just to...
Try and win her back.
 You still love her, don't you?
 I'm not just gonna
give up on us.
 You know?
 We belong together.
 And I'll never stop
believing that.
 Latin lover narrator:
And for as long
as michael lived,
 Until he drew
his very last breath,
 He never did.
