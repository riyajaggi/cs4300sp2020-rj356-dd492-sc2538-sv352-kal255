 Latin lover narrator:
All righty, here we go.
 Jane the virgin
got accidentally inseminated.
 But I've never had sex!
 And this created
a lot of problems
 For a lot of people.
 First, there was rafael,
 The sperm donor
who found himself
 Having feelings for jane.
 But he first had to deal
 With his scheming,
cheating wife.
 We're done, petra.
What?
 But petra wasn't going down
without a fight.
 (groans)
 My husband did it.
Pretty dramatic stuff.
 Also dramatic-- jane's father,
 International telenovela star,
was back in her life.
 I was trying to impress you,
but I went too far. I'm sorry.
 And speaking of
relationships...
(knocking)
 ...Jane's mother was interested
in her father. Very interested.
 Unfortunately, she had to deal
with his ex-wife melissa.
 Maybe send a letter next time.
That's what most fans do.
 There are stalker laws,
you know.
 But xo was winning so far.
 And sadly, jane's love life
was now a mess.
 She pushed off any feelings
for rafael
 Because she was engaged
to michael.
 You knew... All this time.
 But she just found out
michael had been lying to her
 For a very long time.
 D-don't leave.
And that's where we left off.
 Jane's 21st birthday party
 Can be described in one word--
 Epic.
 â™ª
 (whooping)
 (whooping)
 Yeah! Yeah!
 It's your party.
Take a drink.
 (whooping)
 (screaming, doorbell ringing)
 Yes! Oh, there's some more
people coming.
 Excuse me.
(whoops)
 Hmm.
 Latin lover narrator:
In novelas, this is known
 As an encuentro significativo,
 Or a "significant encounter."
 It's the moment
when two people
 Who are meant for each other
have their first encounter.
 Excuse me, miss.
 There's been a noise complaint
from your neighbors.
 In this case, there was
one slight miscalculation.
 You got me a stripper?!
 (michael mumbles,
woman screaming)
no, no, no, no.
 I'm a police officer. No,
there's been a complaint.
 I have a complaint.
Your clothes are still on.
 Oh, I am an...
I'm an actual cop.
 You are too hot
to be a cop.
 But not too hot
to be a naked cop!
 This looks like a real gun!
 (gunshot)
 You're a real cop.
 (sighs)
 Mi amor...
 Oh.
 Hey, wait.
 Now it's snowing
on the yacht.
 Snow makes everything
more romantic.
 Well, I'm just saying,
shouldn't they have coats on?
 I thought you weren't going
to sit here and pick it apart.
 Sorry. I'm sorry.
(laughing)
 (speaking spanish on tv)
 Okay, so...
 What do you like
about telenovelas?
 The idea that two people
are destined to be together.
 Latin lover narrator:
And so, jane explained
to michael
 Why a man professing his love
to a woman
 On a yacht in the snow
 In front
of a semi-realistic background
 Was the epitome of romance.
 So, what's the guy
in the bolero jacket saying now?
 "from our first meeting...
 I knew it was you."
 "I just knew."
 Man (over police radio):
Kendall district station...
 Uh-oh.
(laughs)
 That's me.
Mm-hmm.
 Thanks for not
arresting me.
 Thanks for asking me
to stay.
 (michael laughs)
 That's amazing.
 Latin lover narrator:
Like I said, it was epic.
 But that was then...
 And this is now.
 You got a package.
 Oh, my... My dress.
 (sighs)
 What are you doing here?
 We need to talk. Can
I... Can I come in?
 No. I'm not ready
to talk, michael.
 Come on, baby.
 We just... You know,
we-we got to...
 We got to get through this.
 I want to get married.
 I don't know if I want to.
 Jane... Please.
 What happened?
 Me not telling you
that petra cheated on rafael--
 It was... It was awful.
 I know that.
 I-I am so sorry.
 I know you are.
 But I just... Keep thinking
 About how many times
you lied to me since then.
 You're overreacting.
 You're, like, hormonal
or something.
 Be honest with me.
 Okay, michael?
 This is not a good time.
 You know what? It never is.
 And then I just start
thinking about the baby
 And how
you were gonna let me give it
 To this couple
that had all these problems
 When you knew
how much it meant to me
 For her to go
to a stable family.
 I'm sorry.
 (sighs)
 I just...
 I need more time, michael,
to see
 If I can forgive you
and get past this.
 Okay.
 You okay, baby?
 All of a sudden, I just... I...
 I look at him differently,
 And I don't know
if I can go back.
 Yeah, because
 Taking it off feels so final.
 And you don't want it
to be final?
 I don't want any of this.
 Oh, my god, enough!
I want to stop crying!
 That's what I want!
 (sniffles)
 What time is dinner
with rogelio?
 Oh, honey, let me call him.
We'll cancel.
 No, no, I don't want that.
 It means he's finally
listening to me
 About toning down
the over-the-top gestures.
 Besides, I think
it's sweet
 He wants us to meet
his stepdaughters.
 Former stepdaughters.
 Hopefully, they're not
as bitchy as their mom.
 Xiomara...
 Oh, no.
Oh, no.
 No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
What?
 There has to be a big mistake.
 They gave my student
teaching placement, finally.
 Really? Where'd they assign you?
 That's the thing. That's
where they made the mistake.
 They put you in
a catholic school!
 Mom.
 It's a high school.
 Hello? Hi.
 This is jane villanueva,
 And I'm in the teaching
education program.
 Hi, miranda.
There's been a mistake.
 I just got
my assignment
 And it says that
I'm teaching at a high school,
 But I actually
specified
 Very specifically
 That I would like
 To teach middle schoolers.
 Yes, I do understand
that the degree
 Is in adolescent education,
 But again, I specified...
 No, see, but, see, I feel like
 I can have the most impact
on younger girls.
 No, I-I can't wait
till next semester.
 This is my last requirement
for graduation,
 And I'm pregnant.
 I should have planned better?
Are you serious, miranda?
 Wait, no, no, no, miranda,
miranda, miranda, miranda.
 I'm sorry.
I should not have snapped.
 Listen,
 I had a not-so-great experience
in high school.
 You know, mean girls...
 You get it, right?
Okay?
 And... But-but here's the thing:
 I want to use that experience
 To prevent younger girls,
like middle schoolers,
 From becoming mean girls.
 That's a part of what being
a teacher, for me, is all about.
 Okay.
 Thank you. Good-bye.
 Looks like I'll be teaching
at a catholic high school.
 Maybe you don't tell them
you're a pregnant virgin.
 The nuns or the high schoolers?
 Thanks, grandma.
 (line ringing)
 (horn honking)
hello?
 Jane, hi.
 Sorry, I'm on the bus.
 I just wanted to apologize
 For what happened yesterday,
when you...
 You know, when you said that
 You wanted to raise the baby?
 I was kind of a jerk.
 Oh, you mean when you said that
you would fight me for custody?
 Jane, I'm sorry.
 You know, I was shocked and...
 I didn't mean it.
 It's just... And being a father,
 Like, a present father,
it's just really...
 It's important to me.
 And-and we'll work it out.
 You know?
 You, me and michael.
 Yeah, thanks for saying that.
 Latin lover narrator:
There was so much more,
of course,
 Rafael wanted to say to jane.
 Words like
"I have feelings for you"
 And "let's be together."
 Okay, so I'm almost home.
 I... I'll call you later.
 Yeah, yeah.
Uh, absolutely.
 We'll-we'll talk later.
 Bye, jane.
 Latin lover narrator:
But alas,
the time wasn't right.
 (knocking at door)
 What are you doing here?
 These guys needed help
finding your apartment.
 Rafael solano, you have
the right to remain silent.
 Rafael: Wait a... Whoa.
Anything you say can and
will be used against you
 You have the right
to an attorney.
Hey, what did you do?
 If you can't afford
an attorney,
 One will be provided
for you.
Can someone tell me
 What the hell
is going on?
I'm sorry, rafael.
 I had to tell them what you did.
 (exhales)
 You have to breathe
from deeper down,
 Through your diaphragm.
 Latin lover narrator:
Always the gentleman,
 Rogelio had agreed
to help xiomara
 Prepare for her singing debut
 At the hotel.
 Whoa. I feel really dizzy.
 Oh. You do?
Yeah, could I sit down?
 Oh, of course.
Of course, of course.
 Do you need
anything?
No, no.
I'm fine.
 Oh.
Just a little out of
practice, I think.
 I hope my voice
can fill the lounge.
 Well, you have
your band.
 That's what
they're for.
 I... Don't actually
have a band.
 I've mostly sung
with backing tracks.
 Do you think I need one?
 Yes, yes, you do.
 But you're in luck,
because I have recorded
 Over seven telenovela
theme songs.
 Oh. So... Eight.
 Eight exactly.
 So I have wonderful
musicians I can call.
 Really?
 You said this was
a big shot for you.
 Thank you.
 Of course.
 Xiomara, I didn't
know you were here.
 Rogelio was just
helping me prepare my set.
 Oh, yes.
 Congratulations.
 I'm really glad you're here.
 I've been wanting
to apologize.
 I was such a bitch
when we first met.
 I'm sorry. I didn't know
who you were to him.
 Oh.
 That's okay.
 Good, melissa.
You can make it up
 To xiomara
by booking her a band.
 My best musicians.
 Absolutely. Right away.
 Uh, you should
go down to the lobby.
 The reporter from telemasivo
is waiting
 To interview you.
Ah, yes, yes.
 Xiomara, I'll see
you at dinner.
 Perfect.
 I really look forward
 To bringing our
families together.
 Oh, thank you for saying that.
 Uh, me, too.
 And I know jane's
really looking forward
 To meeting your daughters.
 Stay away from him.
 Excuse me?!
 Do you think I don't
know your type?
 My type?!
 You didn't want
 A relationship with rogelio
 Until you realized
he was famous.
 I had lost track of him.
 There's a word for that, honey.
 Starts with "gold."
 Ends with "digging."
 Oh, yeah? Well, there's
a word for you, too.
 Starts with nasty.
 Ends with...
 Smile!
 #awkwardfamilydinner.
 That was funny, valeria.
 I'm gonna tweet that
to my 6.3 million followers.
 To my former stepdaughters.
 You will always be
stepdaughters in my heart.
 And I'm so happy you chose
to relocate to miami.
 Mom made us 'cause she's
managing your career,
 And you wanted to
be closer to jane.
 Well, that's not
entirely true.
 We moved to miami
because production
 Of my show
moved here permanently.
 Because you told them you wanted
to be closer to jane.
 Details are not important.
 What's important is
you are here now.
 And you get to meet
the brilliant jane.
 My daughter.
 Who tomorrow will be a teacher.
 Just, like, a student teacher.
 I believe teaching
is one of the most
 Noble professions
in the world.
 So, are you really
a pregnant virgin?
 Well, they were asking
about the circumstance,
 And I did not want them to
get the wrong idea about you.
 Or your incredible purity.
 Why haven't you swiped
your "v" card?
 Can't find someone
to have sex with you?
 Xiomara:
Don't let those girls
get to you.
 They're mean like their mom.
 I kind of felt bad
for them actually.
 Rogelio really went
overboard again.
 And I just need to tell him
to tone it down a little more.
 (car horn beeps)
rogelio: Jane,
 This is for you.
 Jane:
You got me a car?
 Or a lot more.
 What the hell is your problem?
 Our drug investigation turned
into a double homicide.
 And the latest victim
named sin rostro--
 One of the biggest
drug lords around--
 As his assailant, and
we don't have any leads.
 This is the dead
bellboy's locker, right?
 Hey, what's this?
 Now we're talking.
 Well, call it.
 It could be one of
sin rostro's contacts.
 Nothing. It's disconnected.
 We'll run a history.
 Good eye.
 (cell phone ringing)
 (cell phone dinging)
 (school bell ringing)
 Latin lover narrator:
Which brings us here.
 Now, with jane back
in high school.
 And, of course,
we do have a code of conduct
 Required for all our teachers.
 Of course, I understand.
 You will have
no conduct issues with me.
 Good.
 And really, how bad could
 A group of teenagers really be?
 And here's your classroom.
 Oh.
 Girls, sister,
 Please welcome your new teacher
 Ms. Villanueva.
 Oh, uh, those girls
 In the back,
I know them actually.
 Valeria and victoria?
 Mm-hmm.
They just transferred.
 Apparently their father heard
 We had a wonderful faculty.
 Valeria:
Oh, my god...
 This is,
 This is really awkward.
 But we thought this was
a catholic school.
 Oh, it is. Of course.
 Then, why are we being taught
by an unmarried pregnant woman?
 Maybe we can talk in private?
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that
this was the first time
 Jane gloriana villanueva
had ever
 Been called
to the principal's office.
 A pregnant virgin?
 Due to a medical mistake.
 And I absolutely
should've disclosed it.
 But I'm sure you
can understand
 It's a pretty
unconventional situation.
 Yes. It really is.
 The problem,
ms. Villanueva,
 Is that what just happened
 Will be repeated by students
to their parents.
 And I will explain how I
took an unfortunate incident
 And turned it into
a thoughtful choice.
 That's certainly true.
 I-I believe that I have a
lot to offer these girls.
 Just give me a chance, please.
 No more drama?
 You have my word. No more drama.
 Victoria, valeria,
please come in.
 Say hi to your
slutty mom for us.
 I am so not slutty!
 You asked me to tell you
exactly what they said.
 She's right. I heard.
 Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
 You got to put those girls
in their place.
 You want me to help?
I can go after their mom.
 No, stop.
No one's going after anyone.
 The girls are clearly acting out
because they're jealous.
 I'll talk to rogelio,
and he can deal with them.
 And, you, do not engage
with their mom.
 Be the bigger person.
 That's so not her style.
 It is too my style.
 (groans)
 Latin lover narrator:
It was definitely
not her style.
 But still,
xiomara was determined
 To take jane's advice.
 I really appreciate
you arranging the band.
 I know this situation
must be hard for you.
 Thank you, xiomara.
 I appreciate it.
 Meet the girls in your band.
 And yes.
 Rogelio has slept
 With every single
one of them.
 (quiet laugh)
 Oh, wait, rogelio!
Oh, jane!
 Hey!
 I was so excited
when you tweeted
 You wanted to meet up.
 Unfortunately,
I'm on my way to the set.
 Maybe you could come
by since you have the car?
 No, no, actually I can't.
I have to work.
 But this won't take any time.
 I wanted to talk to
you about the twins.
 They're in your school!
Because melissa wanted them
 Under your influence.
 How could I argue? No?
Right.
 Well, here's the thing.
 Um, you know,
they're a little disruptive.
 What?
Yeah, I mean, it's fine now.
 But I wanted to talk to you
about where it's coming from.
 Oh, yes. Yes, good.
 Because I've been trying to help
with their behavior, but...
 Rogelio, clearly
they're jealous, which I get.
 You know, you've been going
a little overboard
 On the attention again.
 In... In what way?
 The car.
Oh!
 Yes, well, thank you
 For alerting me to
the problem, jane.
 I will take care
of it right away.
 Okay, great, great.
 Thanks.
 (sighs)
 Hey!
 You okay?
 Well, not great.
 Considering I spent
the night in jail.
 Why were you in jail?!
 She said you hit her?
 Yes, and I didn't.
 She just wants... Leverage.
 More money
in the divorce settlement.
 And just so you know,
I would never lay a hand on her.
 And I can't even believe
I have to say that.
 You don't.
 I believe you.
 I... I thought
my life was complicated.
 What's going on with you?
 I have
 Evil stepsisters suddenly...
 Who are enrolled in the school
that I'm teaching at,
 Which is totally taking me back
to high school,
 Which was not
the happiest place for me.
 Wait, what happened
in high school?
 My mom dated this popular girl's
dad, and it ended badly.
 And she turned everyone
against me.
 I can't imagine
anyone intimidating you.
 Well... I-I, I was different
in high school.
 Kind of quiet and shy.
 And... You wouldn't
have noticed me.
 Of course
I would've noticed you.
 Anyway, uh,
 There's nothing like
spending the night in jail.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Um... I can't believe
 Michael didn't tell you
about the arrest.
 (clicks tongue)
 Well, uh, we...
 Are actually
having problems, so...
 Oh?
 Latin lover narrator:
And there it was...
 Yeah.
 ...Briefly.
 An opening.
 Anyway...
 I should get back to work.
 Yes.
 Yeah, okay. Well, uh,
 We'll-we'll talk later?
Mm-hmm.
 All right.
 Xiomara? Can we talk?
 You have to understand,
when jane looks at you,
 She just keeps remembering
this sequence of events
 In her head--
the pregnancy, the lying.
 How do I get that
out of her head?
 I don't know.
 Maybe with time?
 Is she still wearing her ring?
 Seriously, did you
punch yourself?
 Rafael, stop.
 You and I both
know what happened.
 No.
 We don't.
 But we know what's happening.
 Oh, good!
 Then we both know the solution.
 Fine.
 Get the hell out.
 I'm not going anywhere.
 What's yours is mine, remember?
 (knocking)
 Hey, I got a delivery.
 A roman zazo.
 Roman zazo's dead.
 No, this is roman zazo.
 Want to sign?
 Here.
 It's your problem now.
 Excuse me.
 Hi.
 Hi.
What are you doing?
 Ro gave us cars
because he felt bad.
 What?
 Thanks for talking
to him.
 Oh...
 Okay.
 (grunting)
 Oh, my gosh.
 (giggling)
 (laughs and mumbles)
 All right, that's right.
 Why don't you guys erase
that picture?
 No, no, come on,
ser-seriously, guys.
 Okay, all right.
 Stop, erase that photo.
 No way.
 It's perfect for
our web site.
 What web site?
 You haven't seen
it? Show her.
 People are posting the most
hilarious comments about you.
 Okay, just take that down.
 Both:
No!
 Help!
(screams)
 What are you doing?!
What happened?
 This crazy teacher smashed
my sister's tablet.
 I did not.
Yes, she did.
 The teacher's
going psycho.
(stammers)
 I-I did not smash it.
 That is not true.
 Leave my sister alone!
She smashed it.
 That is a lie! You're a liar.
 What is going on here?
 I'm sorry, sister margaret.
 This is exactly
the kind of drama
 I warned you not
to bring to this school.
 Girls, report to my office.
 And you, ms.
Villanueva...
 Latin lover narrator:
Though not a math teacher,
 Jane unfortunately knew
the answer to this problem.
 This just isn't working out.
 I cannot put off graduation.
 I have been in school
for six years while working,
 And this is my last requirement.
 I have to finish now
because I have a baby coming,
 And I would really like...
 Miranda, I'm just gonna say it.
 You really don't have
a lot of compassion.
 I can't believe this.
 Okay, jane, listen up.
 I took your advice, right?
 With melissa?
 I stayed above the fray.
 And-and you were right.
 I mean, it's not the band
that I would have chosen,
 But it's working.
 What's your point, ma?
 Now it's your turn
to listen to me.
 Because I know how to take down
16-year-old bitches.
 Back off--
he clearly smiled at me.
 Hey, girls.
 Want to go for a swim?
 Yeah, definitely.
 You hate getting
your hair wet.
 Shut up, I do not.
 Come on, I'll race you.
 (speaking in spanish)
 All right, all right.
 Tell her you love
her already.
 Oh, he's got
to be kidding me.
 Petra.
 I can live
without air and water.
 Well, what do you
want me to do, huh?
 If we move out of here,
we're abandoning the property.
 And it's
all we have left.
 He's frozen
my accounts.
 Where are you going?
 I have to use the commode; lunch
isn't sitting well with me.
 Mother, they've turned off
the water, you can't flush.
 Ugh.
 (cell phone ringing)
 Hello.
 Look, ivan, I'm working on it.
 I'm... Rafael and I are
having some problems.
 I don't have access to cash...
 Yes.
 Don't worry, you'll have it
by tomorrow night.
 Rafael:
Did you get some good stuff?
 Oh, yeah.
 My mom is right.
 The secrets of these teenagers'
lives are in these phones.
 Ah, I should have listened
to her in high school
 And stood up
to those mean girls.
 Mmm... You know, if I was
in high school with you,
 I would have set them straight.
 Like I said,
you wouldn't have noticed me.
 Yes, I would have.
 No, you wouldn't.
 Okay, you're probably right,
I wouldn't.
 But look at what
I would have been missing.
 (cell phone chimes)
 Everything okay?
 Mm-hmm, yeah.
 Mike wants to talk.
 Oh.
 Um...
 How are you, uh, you
feeling about everything?
 I don't know.
 There's just
so much to consider.
 Latin lover narrator: And
there it was again, an opening.
 Yeah...
 Including the fact
that I have feelings for you.
 What?
 Look, I know
this is a horrible time,
 But it... Just in case it...
 In case it means anything
or if it changes anything.
 Uh...
 I don't understand.
 You said you see me as a sister.
 We talked about this.
 I-I know, and I did.
 But then something changed.
 I've never felt this type
of connection with anyone
 In my entire life.
 A-and we're having a baby,
you know?
 Look, jane,
this-this is crazy, I know.
 But I've never been
the type of guy that believes
 In fate or destiny.
 What are the chances, huh?
 I mean, we kissed
five years ago,
 And now we're-we're-we're here.
 It sounds crazy,
 But doesn't this just all
kind of feel meant to be?
 I know it's a lot,
a-and you need to think,
 But I just, I
had to tell you.
 Latin lover narrator:
And so rafael left jane
with a terrifying thought.
 A thought she couldn't
even say aloud.
 You came so soon.
 Must be a good sign.
 Look, I meant it, rafael.
 Half my original ask, and I'll
be out of your hair for good.
 I don't think so.
 Can we come in?
 Do you know olivia?
 I don't think so, no.
 We do know each other,
mrs. Solano.
 Olivia's one of the many women
who changes our sheets
 And cleans
our bathrooms.
 In any case,
 Olivia saw you
leaving my office
 The day that you claim
I hit you.
 And she's ready
and willing to testify
 That you left
without a scratch.
 You know what the penalty is
 For making a false
assault claim, petra?
 Hmm?
 You could go
to prison.
 I don't remember
seeing you there.
 Apparently.
 Then again, you didn't even
recognize me just now.
 I guess it's her word
against yours.
 Drop the charges,
get out of my suite now.
 I have to pack.
 Oh.
 And don't forget your boyfriend.
 Hi there.
 Hey, jane.
 Your web site's
really taking off.
 I know.
 It-it actually inspired me.
 Yeah, I decided to make
a web site of my own.
 About you two.
 And I've got
plenty of material.
 Ooh.
 Unflattering selfies,
pre-nose-job shots.
 And what seem to appear
as some personal pictures
 Meant for, I don't know,
boyfriends?
 How'd you get those?
 Doesn't matter.
 You're gonna take down
that web site.
 Then you're gonna go
to sister margaret frances
 And tell her
what happened yesterday
 And get me my job back now.
 (crying)
stop crying.
 But mom's
gonna kill us.
 Look, you should have thought
about that before.
 Easy for you to say.
 You have these
amazing parents.
 Our mom is horrible.
 And we don't know
where our dad is.
 Stop crying.
I'm sorry, I can't.
 Latin lover narrator:
It was one of those moments.
 Stop it, vic.
 When you see someone
differently.
 We weren't
telling the truth.
 We smashed our own tablet
and started yelling.
 Ms. Villanueva
didn't do anything.
 Excuse me?
 But, like you said--
 Teachers must be role models.
 And the church
teaches forgiveness.
 And I forgive them.
 And I ask that
you forgive me, as well,
 For all the drama
because I know,
 I just know I can be
a real asset here.
 I think she can, too.
 Sister margaret:
You're not off the hook, girls.
 We understand.
We're sorry.
 Well, there's nothing
we can do about the past,
 So let's just move forward.
 Report back
to work Monday.
 Latin lover narrator:
And so jane the virgin left
with her job intact
 And her heart full
of forgiveness.
 I didn't think
you'd let her stay.
 But I'm glad you did.
 She really seems
like a good girl.
 She does, doesn't she?
 Also there's this.
 5,000 followers
in two days.
 Hundreds of comments.
 They want to meet her.
 This might help bring
people to the church.
 Why the marina?
 Because this is now
ours for the evening.
 I know it's
not a yacht.
 It's just a
patrol boat,
 So we may have to pick
up a couple, uh...
 Drunk boaters
along the way...
Michael,
 Michael...
I tried to
make it snow,
 But those machines are
ridiculously expensive.
 You shouldn't have done this.
 (sighs)
 I had to.
 Because when you...
You think about me now,
 You're just thinking
about what happened,
 All the mistakes
I've made...
 And you need to stop
thinking about that.
 You need to remember
the important stuff.
 I know you, jane.
 You believe in
"meant to be."
 We just have to
find our way back.
 Please, jane,
forgive me.
 I do.
 I forgive you.
 But I-I...
 I can't be with you.
 I can't go back.
I'm sorry, michael.
 I don't under...
Uh, I don't...
 Something's changed.
Nothing's
changed.
 I just, I can't explain it,
 But something... It-it is...
Jane, jane,
jane. Jane.
 This... This...
 This doesn't
make sense.
 I mean, what...
What, is it...
 Because I lied?
 Latin lover narrator:
Of course, it wasn't just that.
 There was also...
 But jane would never
say that aloud.
 Ever.
 I'm so sorry, michael.
 I'm sorry.
 â™ª
 Jane!
How lucky.
 I was waiting for you.
I hoped I'd see you drive up
 In your car.
 Right.
 Um...
 I actually took the bus.
 I'm sorry, I can't keep the car.
Why?
 Because it's completely
inappropriate.
 And giving the twins cars
 Was completely inappropriate.
 But you said they were
jealous of yours.
 Yeah, that's the point.
 Nobody should have a car.
 They're just big,
meaningless gestures,
 And we talked
about how
 You weren't going
to be doing
 Any big, meaningless gestures.
 A car isn't meaningless
to me, jane.
 I know this is very,
very hard to believe,
 But up until five years ago,
 I was barely getting by.
 I could only afford
to buy myself a car
 When I was 35.
 32 if anyone asks.
 And then I met you,
and, well...
 You have your life set.
 You're a grown-up.
 Engaged, working,
getting your degree...
 Pregnant.
 I missed all the big things,
 So I wanted to do something,
 As a father, so I thought...
 A car.
 You have so much
going on.
 That way, you won't
have to spend time
 Waiting for the bus.
 So...
 A little misguided, yes,
 But it wasn't meaningless.
 Well, I can actually use a car
 Now that I don't have
michael driving me around.
 Oh, no, what happened?
 It turns out you didn't miss
all the big things.
 Hi, mom. What's up?
 Uh, xiomara,
 We must have gotten
our signals crossed.
 What?
I thought you weren't
comfortable with the girls.
 You liar.
 You set me up.
 Jane, sometimes,
you know, things happen,
 And afterwards
we see people differently.
 Yes, exactly.
 Xiomara:
Rogelio?
 You ex-wife told the
band not to come.
 It was
a miscommunication.
 A miscommunication?
Are you serious?
 I'm gonna let
you handle this one.
Uh...
 Break a leg,
mom.
 Well?
 You two just ruined
 A beautiful moment
 Between me and my daughter,
so what's this about?
 It was a simple
misunderstanding
 That xiomara's
blown completely...
 Latin lover narrator:
And xiomara had
come between them.
 It was one of those moments
 When you see everything
differently.
 How will we live
in this tiny room?
 I don't have any cash, mother.
 We're very lucky rafael
let us stay the night.
 (knocking at door)
 Our toilet paper.
 Ivan...
 You are
switching rooms?
No.
 What, you thought
I would not find you?
No, no, no, no.
 Please, keep
your voice down.
 I-I... Like
I told you,
 I'm having some trouble
with my husband.
 I just need a little
bit more time.
 You have no more time!
 Okay.
Magda:
My daughter
 Is not getting
shot tonight.
 I saw it in
the cards.
 Petra:
Oh!
 Now what?
 (jane whoops)
 Thank you all
for coming tonight.
 We've had a glitch,
unfortunately, no band.
 But hey, I haven't performed
with a band before tonight...
 So... Here goes.
 (patrons cheering)
you got this! (whoops)
 (singing lyrically in spanish)
 (xiomara continues singing)
 Michael:
Nadine.
 It's me.
 Eli isn't a person,
it's a shipping company.
 Sin rostro must be expecting
a big shipment of drugs.
 That number that you found
is not a phone number;
 It is the answer key.
 The slip, the crate,
the dock number...
 (laughs)
 We're... We're gonna
get him, nadine.
 (xiomara singing)
 (cheering)
 Bravo!
 (cheering, whistling)
 You were
incredible.
 Thanks.
Oh...
 It was kind of surreal.
I was so nervous.
 Well, you
didn't look it.
 No, you
looked like
 You belonged
up there.
 Thank you,
baby.
 So we didn't even get to talk.
The twins really confessed?
 Yeah, they did.
 Probably should have
taken your advice
 Back in high school,
when I was dealing
 With stephanie
kovakovich.
 (laughs)
or...
 Maybe I shouldn't have
 Dated her father
to begin with.
 Well, yeah, yeah,
that's for sure.
 Eh.
 I'll leave you
two alone.
 Congrats,
mom.
 Thank you.
 You were perfection.
 And I must apologize
for melissa.
 Xiomara, I owe her a lot
 And I tend to look the other way
when she's possessive.
 But I won't do that.
 Not with you.
 You're too important to me.
 In a short time,
 You have become too important.
 We can't.
 You have to focus on your
relationship with jane,
 And I'll only
get in the way.
 No.
 No, you won't.
 I already did,
when I...
 Interrupted you two
earlier, right?
 Look,
historically,
 My romances haven't
always gone well,
 And that's
affected jane.
 If we don't work,
there could be tension,
 It could be awkward,
and... That could
 End up complicating her
relationship with you.
 I just can't risk that.
 Yeah, well...
 That makes sense.
 But I wish it didn't.
 Yeah, I know.
 Me, too.
 â™ª
 Rafael:
Hey.
 Hey.
 I saw you come out here.
 You looked... Kind of upset.
 Yeah.
 Didn't want to ruin
my mom's night, so...
 What happened?
 Latin lover narrator:
And that's when
 Jane looked at rafael
 And said the words
 She knew would change
everything.
 Forever.
 I broke up with michael.
 â™ª
 Latin lover narrator:
Jane knew in her heart
that this was absolutely
 The last thing
she should be doing.
 The absolute last thing.
