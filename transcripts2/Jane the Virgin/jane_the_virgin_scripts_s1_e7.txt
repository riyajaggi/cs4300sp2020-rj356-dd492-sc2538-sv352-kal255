 Latin lover narrator:
Okay, here's where we left off.
 Jane the virgin
got accidentally inseminated.
But I've never had sex!
 And this created a lot of
problems for a lot of people.
 First, there's rafael,
the father of the baby.
 He recently found out
his wife was cheating on him.
 We're done, petra.
What?
 But petra had bigger problems.
 See, she was being blackmailed
by a man named ivan.
 (speaks czech)
and now she couldn't pay him.
 Yup, pretty dramatic.
 Also dramatic-- jane recently
reunited with her father.
 I'm not walking away from you,
jane gloriana villanueva.
 And her mother
having grown closer
 To him, as well, until...
 You have to focus on your
relationship with jane,
 And I'll only
get in the way.
 But jane didn't know that.
See, she was busy
 With her new job--
student teaching.
 Girls, please welcome
your new teacher,
 Miss villanueva.
 Erase that photo.
No way.
 It's perfect
for our web site.
 Have you seen
this web site?
 Although teaching was going to
get complicated, as well.
 This might might help
bring people to the church.
 And speaking of complicated,
 Jane just found out her fiancÃ©
had been lying to her
 For a very long time.
All this time,
 You knew,
and you didn't tell me.
 And so, she ended it with him,
but still,
 She never expected
this to happen.
 And now, we'll continue.
 Latin lover narrator:
When jane villanueva
was nearly 19,
 She kissed rafael solano
for the very first time.
 It was magical,
it was perfect.
 He's amazing.
(gasps)
shut up.
 The guy you've been
after all summer?
 I thought he didn't know
my name, and he did.
 Oh, my god, and I swear, the
kiss wasn't even the best part.
 We had a talk. It was
like one of those talks
 That lasts forever, and then
he looked into my eyes...
 Unfortunately, as jane
described their magical talk,
 Xo had the distinct impression
that...
 He sounds like a playboy, hon.
 I know. I know.
 He seemed like
he would be,
 But he wasn't.
 He seemed so sincere.
 That's what makes
a good playboy.
 You never feel like
you're getting played.
 It's a good lesson.
 From now on,
stay away from guys like that.
 Latin lover narrator:
And for four years,
nine months and 23 days,
 Jane did stay away
from guys like that.
 (xiomara clears throat)
 Sorry to interrupt.
 We-we were just...
We-we had the...
I was just
 Looking for you because
abuela's waiting in the car.
 Okay, sure. Coming.
 Okay, I should go home.
 In truth,
jane's head was spinning.
 What just happened? She broke
up with michael hours ago.
 Jane!
(tires screech)
 (horn honks)
 And yet, she had
this feeling with rafael.
 What kind of feeling?
 Like I'm meant to be
with him or something,
 Which I know
sounds ridiculous.
 Yeah, it does.
I'm sorry.
 I have to say it.
 If it were me,
you would say it.
(scoffs)
 You just broke up with michael
who you were with for two years.
 Yeah, I know.
It's crazy to jump into
something so fast.
 And rafael isn't exactly
 A no-strings-attached
rebound guy.
 And you're having
a baby together.
 What if something goes
wrong? It could get ugly.
 Not to mention the fact that we
know he used to be a playboy.
 And you're from
different worlds.
 He's still married.
 And his soon-to-be
ex-wife seems crazy.
 Yeah, that's true.
That is all true.
 Don't go there, jane.
 You're too
smart for that.
 Mm.
Latin lover narrator: And yet...
 You're totally staring at your
phone, waiting for it to ring.
 No, I'm not.
She totally was.
 (speaking spanish)
 Now, how can I
afford studio space?
 What do I look like,
paulina rubio?
(phone ringing)
 Omg! It's him, it's him!
 Hello?
 Oh, hi. Hey. (chuckles)
 How are you?
 What?
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Hi.
(clears throat)
 What are you doing here?
 I just really wanted
to see you again.
 Jane, our kiss
last night...
 Well, it just kind of happened.
 Um, before things go further,
I just...
 I wanted to do things
the right way
 And take you on a date.
 I also really want
to kiss you again.
 I can't.
 Uh, what's wrong?
 Come on.
 I just ended things
with michael last night,
 And my head is spinning,
and however I feel about you...
 How do you feel about me?
 Just...
 Give me some time, okay?
 I have a lot on my plate.
 No problem. I get it.
 Just, um, I don't know.
 Let me know
when I can kiss you again.
 I'll see you later.
 Looking forward to it.
 Your phone
was buzzing.
 Uh, I have to get ready
for school, but I will see you
 At the hotel for
dinner with rogelio.
 Actually, I'm gonna skip it.
 Why don't you go,
just the two of you?
 What happened? You're suddenly
not into rogelio?
 Latin lover narrator:
Here's the truth.
 Xo didn't want to complicate
 Jane's relationship
with her father.
 Ugh, he's too dramatic.
 Magda: Petra,
what are you doing?
 Petra:
Ivan, I'm going to shoot you.
(ivan groaning)
 Latin lover narrator:
Petra, you'll recall,
had two big problems.
 Petra: I'm going to take off
your pillowcase now, okay?
 So just stay calm.
 Okay.
(grunts)
 No, no, shh.
(grunting)
 Ivan, ivan,
keep your voice down.
 Get him back in
the closet, petra.
 Turn the television on.
He's too loud!
 Shh. Shh.
(television playing)
 Stop it! Stop!
(grunting)
 Man (over tv): Here's a bit
of movie trivia for you.
 Did you know that tom selleck...
 What is your
plan, petra?
 (muffled groaning continues)
I don't know, mother.
 I've never
held someone hostage before!
 We can't let him go.
He'll tell milos where we are.
 Well, we can't just
leave him in there.
 He just wants money, okay?
Uh-huh.
 $250,000-- that's what
this is about.
 You know, I think his price
might just have gone up.
 (muffled groaning continues)
 Jane?
 These are
the flanagans.
 Hi.
 May I just give you a hug?
 A hug?
 Oh. (laughs)
 You must be a parent
of one of my students.
 No.
 We don't actually
have kids... Yet.
 But we really, really want to.
 That's great.
 Really? You think so?
 Mm-hmm.
 That's-that's
incredible.
(laughs)
 We're just so happy
to hear that.
 Okay.
 Thank you, jane.
 You're welcome.
 (school bell rings)
so I should go.
 Of course. God bless you!
 You, too.
 Thank you so much.
 Let's just hope her
fertility rubs off on you.
 Oh, stop.
 A hug never hurt anyone.
 I just think it's wrong.
 Nonsense.
 I prayed long and hard
about this, and I know
 God brought jane to us
for a purpose.
 To bring more people
to our church.
 Here. Pass out more coins.
 It was just so weird,
the way they were staring at me.
 Then they asked
for a hug.
 Maybe they know
you're my daughter.
 My fans do crazy things.
 You know, that could
actually be it.
 You guys doing okay?
We're great.
I asked for
 My salad to be slightly dressed.
This is just dressed.
 My potatoes are cold,
there's a smudge on my knife,
 And...
(mutters in spanish)
 Oh. He is fine.
He's absolutely fine.
 So, jane, how
is your mother?
 She's fine.
 Oh, wonderful.
 I'm fine, too.
Make sure she knows that.
 What happened to you two?
 Why? Did she
say something?
 Just that it was complicated
and you were being dramatic.
 She said that I was dramatic?!
 That's right!
You're looking good!
 â™ª
 (whoops)
 (music stops)
 All right!
(clapping)
 Great job, girls.
Good job. You were awesome!
 We'll see you next week.
Now, get out!
 Miss xo?
 My daughter really
wanted to introduce us.
 Apparently, we both like
pistachio ice cream
 And the color orange, so
we're perfect for each other.
 Oh, so that's why
eva was asking.
 I'll give you two some privacy.
 So, here's the deal.
 My daughter really
wants me to ask you out.
 I don't know how
she knows this,
 But apparently you just
ended things with someone?
 (crying):
And one, two, three.
 One... (crying)
 I'm sorry, guys.
 I just ended things
with someone.
 (crying)
 Oh.
 So, what do you say?
 Want to get some
pistachio ice cream?
 I'll wear orange.
 Sounds tempting. (laughs)
 But I'm not looking
to date right now.
 Gotcha.
 Well, for the record,
I wasn't planning on doing this.
 But then I saw you, and
I figured it was worth a try.
 Good-bye.
 Hey.
 Your watch.
 Thank you.
 And I was wondering if you
hadn't seen my computer case.
 It was in the living room...
 Jane, stop.
 Come on, jane,
I can't... I can't do this.
 Do what?
 This. Returning
each other's stuff.
 Like, what is happening here?
 Look, I lied.
 I know that.
I-I didn't want the baby,
 And I panicked,
and I am so sorry.
 But this is not
the end for us, jane.
 You don't go
from marrying someone
 One day to breaking up--
it doesn't happen.
 I don't know
what to say, michael.
 Something's changed.
 I, uh...
 I'm sorry.
Is this about rafael?
 No.
 Okay. I'm sorry. I just...
 I just had to ask.
 I have to go to work.
 It was awful and awkward.
 Oh, that's terrible.
 Want to know what
will help get your mind
 Off of it?
 â™ª my birthday.
 Luca: Congratulations!
You waited a whole
 Ten seconds to work in
your birthday.
 And it came up
perfectly naturally.
 What's going on?
 Frankie: Well, you know
how we were supposed
 To go to the opening
of that club.
Mm-hmm.
 Well, I thought we were on the
list, but it turns out we can't
 Get on the list because the guy
who was going to get us
 On the list...
She wants you to ask rafael
 If he can get us
back on the list.
 He's an investor
in the club.
 Oh.
 Frankie: And he's your
baby daddy, so he kind of
 Has to say yes, right?
 Yeah, I'll ask him
next time I see him.
 Great.
 He's right over there.
 Have you had enough time?
 Ready to go on a date?
 No. I came to ask a favor,
actually,
 Which is totally unrelated
to our current situation.
 And what is our
current situation?
 Back to the favor.
So, there's a club
 That you're apparently
an investor in.
 Viento.
Yes, exactly.
 And it's my friend's birthday.
 I was dispatched
to ask if you could
 Put a group of us on a list.
 I'd be happy to.
 Great. She'll be thrilled.
 But just so you know,
I'm gonna be there, so...
 Huh?
Yeah, it's opening night,
 I have to make an appearance,
so we'll be there, together.
 Not a problem.
 But just so you understand,
it's not a date.
 Agreed.
Definitely not a date.
 No, seriously, it's not a date.
I know, it's not a date.
 No. You're smiling
when you say that.
 No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Say it again, no teeth.
 It's not a date.
 (clears throat)
 So, you want
to get frozen yogurt
 And watch love actually tonight?
I can't.
 I have plans. It's frankie's
birthday, and we're going
 To this club.
What club?
 I think viento.
Really?
 I've read about that place.
How'd you get in?
 Rafael's an investor,
actually, so...
 Ah. So he'll be there.
 Yes, but we're not
going together.
 Yeah, but he will be there.
Enough, mom.
 Man:
Next stop, biscayne boulevard.
 Rogelio was
asking about you.
 Way to change the subject.
 So... What'd he say?
 Well, he said that
you were the one
 That was actually
being melodramatic.
 Me?!
 Latin lover narrator:
What you are about to witness
 Is two creatures
who are inherently dramatic
 Attempt to behave like they are
 Not dramatic.
Hey.
 Oh. Hi there.
 How have you been?
Great, actually.
 Me, too. Really great.
Happier than ever.
 Life is beautiful.
I'm having fun.
 I'm having so much fun.
In fact,
 I have a date tonight.
Me, too.
 You also have
a date tonight?
 Yeah, that's right.
So, I tell you I have a date,
 And suddenly
you have a date, too?
 No, not suddenly.
I already had a date.
 You just suddenly know about it.
 Well, great.
 Wonderful. If we
both have dates,
 We should do it
together, you know?
 Double date-- for two
people who both have dates.
 I can't wait!
 Great.
Great.
 And now you are witnessing
two creatures
 Who both need to find dates.
 (exhales)
 Look, I'm... I'm here because
I'm desperate, lachlan.
 I-I've... Never been
desperate before.
 What do you want?
 Money. $350,000.
 I'll pay it all
back as soon as
 I get my divorce-- I'll get more
than enough out of the prenup.
 Look, I know you have no reason
 To trust me or... Help me
 After what I did,
leaving you for rafael
 And making you look
bad in that meeting.
 You're right.
 I have no reason
to trust you or help you.
 Magda:
Now what?
 I don't know.
 We can't keep him
here forever.
 We might have
to consider...
 What?
 I know people from
the old country.
 They could take care
of him for us.
 Petra:
Mother, that's crazy!
 Magda:
It is realistic.
 Now, here are your options:
You kill him...
 ...Or let him go, and
risk milos finding you--
 And then you'll
wish you were dead.
 Your choice.
 What are these?
 They're not from me.
 I just came by to drop off
your computer case.
 They came while
I was here.
 You're not the person
I thought you were.
 Hi.
We have to talk.
 Michael saw
the flowers you sent,
 And he was so hurt--
it was awful.
 Jane, that wasn't
my intention.
 I know.
 But that's why
I'm saying it's too soon.
 What, because of michael?
Yes, because of michael.
 We were engaged. I was...
I was about to marry him.
 I'm sorry.
 But, jane, he's kind of
been a jerk to me.
 And you don't think
that's justified?
 I mean, whatever jealousy he was
feeling, clearly he was right
 In feeling it,
because there's something here.
 That's exactly my point, was
that there's something here.
 Don't you understand
there are
 Other people's
feelings involved?
 We can't just do
whatever we want.
 Just stop all of this.
 Okay.
 Woman:
Jane.
 I'm nora.
 This is my
husband ben.
 We are just so excited
to meet you.
 Can I just
get one hug?
 I'll be quick.
 I swear.
 Uh... Oh. Oh!
 Do you by any chance
know my father?
 Of course.
 Ah.
 Everyone knows him.
 Ben:
Thank you again.
 My wife took the coin home,
and we so want
 A baby, so we thought
it's worth a try.
 Sorry,
 What coin are you
talking about exactly?
 You're selling coins
with my face on it?
 No, not selling-- distributing.
 This is crazy!
 This is hope, miss villanueva.
 This is already bringing
more people to the church.
 Why didn't you tell me
about this?
 Well, many people like you,
and like st. Theresa,
 Are humble
about publicizing their gifts.
 I am not a saint.
 Yes. We made that clear
in the web site.
 You are, however,
 A pregnant virgin.
 Medical mistake or not,
it is a miracle.
 I mean,
think of the moments
 That had to happen
to lead you up
 To your pregnancy.
 And think of the hope
that you are giving others
 Who believe in your
extraordinary fertility.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm just not comfortable
with this.
 Nadine:
Anything?
 My contact in ecuador confirmed
 That sin rostro's shipping
container is coming in two days.
 Okay.
 Okay, this is big.
 We intercept a huge drug
shipment, we're heroes.
 What is up with you?
 This case is your baby;
you should be celebrating.
 I'll celebrate when
we intercept the drugs
 And catch sin rostro.
 Hi. We're on the list.
 Jane villanueva,
party of four.
 We're gonna have so
much fun. I promise.
 You doing okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
 Latin lover narrator:
She was not fine.
 Follow me, please.
(squealing)
 Shh.
 Saint jane the virgin
 Was in no mood to be
in a nightclub tonight.
 And she was certainly
in no mood to see...
 Rafael.
 (gasps)
 Ooh, I knew
your baby daddy
 Was gonna be surrounded
by women all night.
 Jane:
Look, our drinks are here.
 Happy birthday.
Thank you.
 At least rafael was heeding
jane's warning
 And staying away.
 I mean, sure,
I like the stage,
 But the thing
about television
 Is that you get
to touch so many
 Lives, all at once.
 That's so true.
 Plus, plays
are so boring.
 That is also true.
 Latin lover narrator:
Welcome to the worst
 Double date in the world.
 So what do you do
for work, marco?
 Though we can't all be
international superstars,
 We all must make
a living, right?
 I'm kind of
in-between jobs.
 Oh, so you're unemployed.
 (thump)
 Currently, yeah.
 Hmm.
 I played professional soccer
for a few years.
 Just retired.
 You were a professional
soccer player?
 In europe for seven years and
the last five here in the states
 With the new york red bulls.
 Wait, you're marco esquivel?
 Yeah.
You're really awesome.
 Oh, I was
all right.
 Now I feel stupid
for not knowing.
 No, I'm sorry.
I-I usually never lead with it,
 Because people tend
to treat me differently.
 Rogelio:
Uh,
 I agree completely. I
wish people would treat me
 Like a normal person.
And here is
 The bottle we special ordered
for you, mr. De la vega.
 Please, take it away.
I'll be happy
 To drink normal people wine.
 So, why-why did you stop?
 Too old?
 My daughter, actually.
 I was just traveling too much.
 I can't miss
all these important moments,
 You know?
 You know, my daughter
can't stop talking
 About how much
she loves your class.
(chuckles)
 Come here, you.
(chuckles)
 Xiomara: Well, I'm not supposed
to have favorites, but...
 Between you and me,
she's my favorite.
 Mine, too.
 (chuckles)
 Latin lover narrator:
Meanwhile, it should be known
 That frankie was having
the most fun she'd had since...
 Well, her last birthday.
 (laughter)
 You know what's not fun?
 Being the sober pregnant girl
in a noisy nightclub.
 Hey, you guys want
to go grab some food?
 No. You, jane, dance.
No, no, no, no.
 Jane, let me explain.
Oh, no. You don't
have to explain anything.
 She's an old friend. That was
weird. It meant nothing.
No, no, no. It's fine.
 We're gonna go dance anyway,
so I'll see you later.
 Jane...
Take care! Come on,
guys, let's go dance.
 (whooping)
 Latin lover narrator:
On the bright side,
 Xiomara's night was going
much better than expected.
 So, I had a lot
of fun tonight.
 Yeah. Me, too.
 All that remained was
the romantic kiss good night.
 And so,
with nothing in their way...
 (rogelio coughing)
 I apologize, but my beautiful
date is going dancing,
 Whereas I must work tomorrow.
 Great.
Thanks for the announcement.
 Rogelio:
Yes.
 Oh, and I might need a ride home
 Because I had too much
normal people's wine.
 (chuckles)
 (sighs)
it's okay.
 I have to wake up early
with my daughter anyway.
 Good night.
 (grunts)
let's go.
 Petra: You have to eat something
or you'll die.
 I'm going to take off
your gag, but one kick...
 Good.
 Don't let him have that fork.
 I'm not stupid, mother.
 (choking)
 Is that peanut sauce?
 I don't know. I just ordered
chicken from room service.
 I have peanut allergy.
 Oh, my... Mother, go!
Get your medicine pen!
 My mother's allergic
to shellfish.
 Mother, now!
 We should let him die.
 What?
 He dies, our problem is over.
 Can't breathe.
 Oh, my god.
(gasping)
 Mother, where is it?! Now!
 What?
 Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
 Come on.
Come on.
 Come on. Come on!
(grunting)
 (gasping)
 (panting)
 Thank you.
 (panting)
 Uh, wait.
 I was just trying
to get some water.
 That's vodka.
Ah, thank you.
 Here you go.
 Thanks.
 Jane, come on,
this is ridiculous.
 You want to be with me.
Stop.
 I-I can't do that to michael.
 We were together for two years.
 You broke up for a reason.
 Look, he doesn't have to know.
 And I get that you don't
want to hurt his feelings,
 But if that's all it is,
then-then we can be discreet.
 That's not all it is.
 Then what?
 We're having a baby.
 What-what if
something goes wrong?
 It can get more
complicated.
It's true.
 It can.
But we won't let that happen
 Because we'll put
the baby first.
 And if we work...
 Can you imagine
anything better for a baby
 Than its parents
actually together?
 You're still married.
 I filed for divorce.
But petra's crazy.
 She filed assault charges
against you.
 What if she does something else?
 Jane, she just wants money.
 You say the word, I settle.
 We're from
different worlds.
 This isn't
my world, jane.
 Maybe it used to be,
but it's not anymore.
 Look, I just want
to be with you.
 I want to get to know you; I
want to get ready for our baby.
 And I get the timing
isn't perfect,
 But that's just
the way it is.
 But the baby's not waiting.
 Let's take advantage
of this time now,
 Before there are
three of us.
 Jane, I want
to get to know you.
 I'm going outside.
 No one has to know
we're leaving together.
 Just meet me.
 Latin lover narrator:
Jane knew that to go
with rafael would be
 To undo everything she's said,
every signal she's given,
 Every single thing her mother
had warned her about.
 But there was a baby coming.
 They didn't have all the time
in the world.
 (clears throat)
 And so,
for the first time in her life,
 Jane threw caution to the wind.
 Wait, popcorn
and fruit strips?
 Don't judge me.
I have cravings.
 Ooh, and cookies.
What's your flavor?
 Anything with chocolate.
 Good man.
 All right, anything
else you want?
 Mm-hmm.
 Mmm.
 What happened to
being discreet?
 We're the only people in the
popcorn and fruit strips aisle
 Right now.
 Mmm.
 (chuckles softly)
 I'm sorry I got too drunk.
 It's okay.
 Did I do anything
 I'm gonna be
embarrassed about tomorrow?
 I don't think you're gonna
remember anything tomorrow.
 In that case...
 I'm going to tell you
why I got so drunk.
 I was very, very jealous of...
 (mockingly):
Marco the soccer player.
 (chuckles)
 Latin lover narrator:
Luckily,
 Xiomara knew he would remember
none of this tomorrow.
 Meanwhile, jane and rafael
would remember
 Every moment of this night.
 Ducks?
Yes.
 You're scared of ducks?
 I am.
 Look, I was
nine years old.
 And there was an incident.
Mm-hmm.
 I ran out of bread, and
then they all attacked me.
 (laughs)
 Look... Okay, you...
 One duck might be cute,
but six or seven ducks
 Is terrifying.
 (both laughing)
 Your turn--
strangest fear now.
 Because there in the moonlight,
they were having
 One of those talks.
 You know, the kind
that goes on forever.
 Jane:
Why'd your mom leave?
 I don't know,
to be honest.
 I was four.
Mm.
 And I woke up the morning
after my birthday,
 And... She was gone.
 My god.
 What did your dad tell you?
 He said she was gone,
 She was selfish,
and that we had to move on.
 Least favorite food. Now.
 Caviar. I can't stand it.
 You're ridiculous that
you just said caviar right now.
 But I was being honest.
 (both laugh)
 Okay, most surprising
thing about you. Now.
 Oh, oh, uh...
I can rap.
 Like presents?
 No, like my mom was really
into 8 mile for a hot minute.
 Turns out, I have a knack.
 â™ª you asked me to rap
so I'll ask for the map â™ª
 â™ª to your heart, let's take it
slow just to start... â™ª
 Oh, too deep. Too deep!
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
You asked me to rap!
 You have to keep going.
Your fault!
 Keep going! Keep
going! Keep going!
 No! That's all you get.
 Is there anything
you can't do?
 My turn. My question.
 Okay.
 You know, I was thinking
the name gigi was cute.
 Yeah, if you want her
to be a stripper.
 What?
(laughs)
 You hate the
name gigi, too?
 Totally hate it.
 Fine. Let's move on
to boys' names.
 No, no need.
We are having a girl.
 My family only has girls.
 My grandmother,
she had six sisters.
 All of them had daughters.
 True story.
 Wow.
 Latin lover narrator:
It was, in short,
 The most romantic night ever.
 Thank you.
 I appreciate.
 Sure.
 That was smart.
 Seeing his bracelet.
 You've earned his trust.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes,
 The classic
"poison your hostage and then
 Save him to earn his trust"
technique.
 Works every time.
 I hope
the rest of your plan
 Works as smoothly.
 Wake up. Wake up.
 Ah, the leopard!
What? What is it?
 Jane's missing!
 What?
She didn't come
home last night!
 Her bed hasn't been slept in.
 I've called
frankie, lina, luca.
 She's young, xiomara.
 No, no, you don't
understand.
 Jane always comes
home or calls.
 Hi, frankie? Um, it's xo.
 I-I'm sorry to call you again,
but have you heard anything?
 Okay. Thanks.
 What about michael?
 M-maybe she's with him.
 B-but I shouldn't call him.
 You know what, I'm
just gonna call him.
 I-I've called
everyone else.
 Okay. I'm gonna tweet
 My 6.3 million followers with
the hashtag "please find jane."
 Uh, michael?
 Xo? Is everything all right?
 Um, is jane there,
 By any chance?
 Um, no, why?
 Um, I'm sorry, I just...
I'm a little worried.
 She-she didn't
come home last night, and...
 Oh.
 You know jane,
 She doesn't do this.
 Um, yeah, you should...
You should, uh,
 You should check with rafael.
What?
 Yeah. I think they were
planning on meeting up.
 I'm sorry.
 Yeah. So, anyway,
 Um, I got to go.
 Take care, xo.
 1,454 retweets in three seconds.
 Do not worry, xiomara.
 My fans are on
the hunt for jane.
 (gasps)
 Oh! Oh, oh!
Wake up, wake up!
 I'm gonna be late!
I got to get to work!
 Ay! Oh, oh.
 Jane:
Mom, I know. I'm so sorry. I...
 (school bell ringing)
yes, I fell asleep.
 But, yeah, I'm fine
and I'm at school
 And I will call you later. Bye.
 Miss villanueva?
 Sister margaret.
 Good morning.
How are you?
 What are you thinking,
 Coming to school
dressed like this?
 I... Overslept.
 And I was late, but I have
a sweater inside and...
 We do have a strict code of
conduct, and this behavior
 Cannot be tolerated.
 And as for your future here,
 I'm just not comfortable
 With teachers who arrive
on campus like this.
 Would it make you
more comfortable
 If I gave out a few hugs?
 That would certainly help.
 How did you get in here?
 My husband owns the hotel.
 What do you want?
 To help you take down rafael.
 I have information
that will ruin him.
 What's in it for you?
 Money.
 $350,000.
 Now, see... Last time,
you set me up.
 So why should I trust you?
 Because I'm naked.
 Record us.
 You can expose it
and humiliate me
 Any time you want.
 Ruin my life with one
click of a button.
 I'll never be able to show
my face in miami society again.
 I'm interested.
 Latin lover narrator:
Was he ever.
 (sighs)
 You must be rafael
solano, are you not?
 I am.
 Who are you?
 I am jane's father.
 Oh, uh...
 Oh, uh, it's nice
to meet you, sir.
 I wish I could
say the same.
 Jane's mother was
worried all night.
 Oh, I am so sorry.
We-we just kind of...
 No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
 I know your game.
 I used to be
just like you.
 Ridiculously good-looking,
with charisma, with swagger,
 Notching girls
onto my belt.
 No, that's-that's not
what's happening...
 I have had sex
with a lot of women.
 Way more than
you, I'm sure!
 I am sure
that that's true.
 Mm-hmm. But jane
is different.
 Jane is special.
 Remember that.
 Or face the consequences.
 Uh... Uh, got it.
 Jane?
 I think I just met your father.
 I want you to know how much
this means to me.
 Thank you.
 My pleasure.
 (laughs)
 Of course, I don't have access
to the money yet, but...
 I'm not a solano.
 So, what?
You lied to me?
 Think of it as
a deferred payment plan.
 Once I take control
of the hotel,
 You'll get your money.
 So what's this information
that's gonna ruin rafael?
 What the hell were you
thinking, yelling at rafael?
 What were you thinking?
You didn't call.
 I was out.
 My phone died,
I lost track of time.
 Exactly. Which is not like you.
 See, rafael is already
a bad influence on you.
 You're being
ridiculous.
 No, I'm not. You just
don't want to hear it.
 Because you're wrong,
mom, all right?
 He's totally different;
he's a great guy.
 I just don't have
a good feeling.
 Well, you're not exactly
the greatest judge of men.
 Hey.
 And you're not me, jane.
 You make smart choices,
sensible choices.
 Exactly. Because
I was always scared
 Of repeating
your mistakes.
 And, mom,
 I'm just realizing,
because of that,
 I've been afraid to take risks.
 Real risks.
 You've been smart.
 I've been safe.
 And I'm gonna be a mom.
 And moms put their kids first.
 You know that
better than anyone.
 So this is my last chance I get
to follow my heart.
 Do what I want.
 And, yeah,
 Maybe the timing isn't perfect,
 But I want to be with rafael.
 He's a good guy.
 I hope you're right.
 I am.
 You can't protect her
from everything, xiomara.
 You did a fantastic job
raising a daughter
 Who was gifted
with extraordinary dna.
 At some point,
you have to trust that you--
 And I--
prepared her well.
 (knocking)
must be my driver.
 Hi.
 I just came by to drop
off my daughter's fee.
 Six more classes.
 It's not due for a week.
 Well, I know. I-I just
didn't want to... Forget.
 (laughs)
 I also wanted to
ask you something.
 (laughing)
rogelio.
 Good to see you.
 Jane needed to talk
to him, so...
 Gotcha.
 Please?
 Please, can you leave?
 Oh!
 Sorry, I thought you were asking
my permission to speak.
 I'm very sorry.
I'm just gonna go, okay?
 Good day, marco.
 Good day.
 Okay, I've given it a lot of
thought, and I don't want
 To tell the captain
about the drug shipment
 Until after we make the bust.
 If we tell him,
he's gonna call in the dea,
 They'll take all the credit.
 And if we don't, w-we violate,
like, a hundred regulations.
 Oh, come on. Since when
are you a boy scout?
 Forget it, nadine.
It's not happening!
 What is it, michael?
What is going on with you?
 You can't shut your mouth
 For more than five seconds!
 I bet you'd like to try.
 You don't want
to take that bet.
 What are you
gonna do, huh?
 Latin lover narrator: Meanwhile,
the wind was in the trees,
 The air was balmy.
 It had all the makings
of another romantic night.
 We've got to talk.
 Dad, not right now.
 You're fired.
 What?
 Why?
 (scoffs)
 (phone ringing)
 Hey. Where are you?
 I'm on my way to the airport.
 I have to go to mexico city.
