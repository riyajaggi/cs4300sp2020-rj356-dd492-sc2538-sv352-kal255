 Latin lover narrator:
Okay, let's skip over the fact
that jane's a pregnant virgin.
 Who cares? Lots of way more
important stuff is going on.
 For one,
she discovered her father
 Is a famous telenovela star,
 And jane's mom was falling
for him.
 Meanwhile,
jane has been teaching
 At a catholic high school.
 And despite
some initial hurdles...
 You're selling coins
with my face on it?
 No. Not selling.
Distributing.
 ...Jane was in a groove.
Oh, and she recently
 Broke off an engagement
with michael, and she's dating
 Her baby daddy rafael.
 Rafael definitely
has some baggage.
 For one, his ex-wife petra.
See, she recently
 Teamed up with his archrival
lachlan to bring him down.
 But petra had problems
of her own.
 See, she was being
blackmailed by ivan,
 The man who knew
her secret identity.
 Natalia.
 And she had accidentally
taken him hostage.
 Problem was ivan escaped,
leaving petra in great danger.
 And michael was convinced
that rafael
 Was involved with sin rostro,
 A big, bad drug dealer.
And evidence
 Certainly pointed
to the solanos.
 Rafael is definitely
a suspect, okay?
 But if he's involved,
I gotta think
 He's working for his father.
 I mean, emilio is the one
that financed the hotel.
 In fact, even emilio's wife was
starting to suspect him.
 Rafael, what if your father
 Is sin rostro?
Really, I'm not sure
who sin rostro is,
 But at this rate,
we'll have to recap the recap,
 So let's just dive in.
 Latin lover narrator:
From a very young age,
 Jane gloriana villanueva
 Did her very best
to avoid conflict.
 (alba yelling):
 Xiomara:
What? You'll kick me out?
 Alas, it was
sometimes unavoidable.
 Do it, and I'll
take jane with me.
No.
 Oh, no, she's not.
I'm her mother!
 We'll leave tomorrow.
 Luckily, jane had her writing
 To help her navigate
these difficult moments.
 It's a letter, you see,
 Which she would slip
under her grandmother's door
 Late at night.
 And then, in the morning...
 Xiomara: Dear mom,
as usual I'm too proud
 To apologize face-to-face.
 But I'm sorry, okay?
 I was totally disrespectful,
 And I love you,
and I really appreciate
 Everything you do for me
and jane.
 So can we just put it behind us
and never talk about it again?
 You know me; I get embarrassed.
 Love, xo.
 Latin lover narrator:
Unfortunately,
 A letter wouldn't solve
jane's current problem.
 I just really want you
and rafael to bond,
 And I think dinner together
will help.
 Hey!
 Come on, last cookie.
 I'm pregnant over here.
You asked me
 To get onboard; I'm onboard.
 I don't need to have dinner.
 You're, like, 40% onboard.
 And don't get me wrong,
 That is an improvement
from zero,
 But I want more.
 How much more
are you looking for?
Ma.
 This all just happened
so quickly
 In a really un-jane-like way.
 Yeah, and it happened,
and we're having a baby.
 And I don't want the fact
 That you didn't have
this textbook family
 To make you go after something
that maybe isn't right.
 But I think it is right.
 What?
 (chuckles)
 Nothing.
 Fine, let's do dinner.
 Jane:
It's on. Tomorrow night.
 That's great.
Can I call you back?
 What do you mean,
 "that's great"?
 That is not the right attitude.
 You have to crush this.
I will crush it.
 Say it with conviction.
I will crush it.
 I don't believe you.
 I will crush dinner
with your mom, okay?
 And there's someone here.
 Oh... Oh, yeah, sorry.
 We can prep later.
 Prep?
Jane: You have a lot to learn
 In a very short time.
 What is your study style?
Like, flashcards?
 Practice tests?
 I-I don't know.
 Gotcha.
 We'll do both.
 (sighs)
 Sorry about that.
 I am scared, rafael.
 Your father transferred
five million dollars to croatia.
 It doesn't mean he's involved
in anything criminal.
 But maybe he's trying
to flee. I...
 I think we should call
the police.
 Tell them what exactly?
 I-I don't know.
 Maybe he's involved
in whatever's going on here,
 With the tunnels
or sin rostro or whatever.
 I mean, it is his hotel.
 Yeah, it is,
and suspicions like yours
 Could threaten his reputation
and ruin his company.
 We can't go to the police.
 Not until we know for sure.
 So what do you want to do?
 Look, you said he's out of town
 For the next week, right?
 I called the contractor
 Who did our renovations.
 Let me just see
what I can find out,
 But give me until then.
 Nadine:
We got nothin'.
 We're no closer to sin rostro.
 The serbian could
be anywhere.
 Which is why we need
to put a tail on rafael.
 Armstrong said no.
We got the audit.
 We just have to comb
through the finances.
 Which could take weeks.
Family's powerful.
 We gotta go by the book.
Mm.
 Mongolian beef.
 More like mongolian barf.
 Really?
 Not even a little courtesy
laugh on that one, huh?
 When you say something
that's funny, maybe.
 I will make you laugh, nadine.
 Hm? We'll see.
 I'll do it.
I don't know.
 I will do it.
I don't think so.
 (creaking)
 Mother...
 Yeah, what? What?
Mother!
 You're supposed to be awake.
 It's your shift.
(groans)
 Mother of god.
 I'm so tired.
I can't live like this.
 The door is locked.
Yeah, but if milos comes...
 Then I'll be too tired
to wheel away anyway.
 Try to get some sleep, huh?
 Once you get your paycheck,
 We'll buy the plane tickets,
 Start over...
 Okay.
 I was thinking beijing.
 I'm not going
to beijing, mother.
 Look, please, just let me
ask lachlan for help.
 No.
 I do not trust him.
 Jane:
And so, I will leave you
with these last words.
 "parting is such sweet sorrow
 That I shall say good night
till it be morrow."
 From romeo and juliet?
 The play we just saw?
 Oh.
Oh.
 Anyway...
 I thought it was appropriate
 Before finals week
 To take a moment to thank you.
 I have really enjoyed
getting to know
 Each and every one of you.
 And go forth
 And be good citizens
of the world.
 Okay. That's all.
 Victoria:
Wait.
 We got you a present as a class.
 Oh, god.
 Don't cry.
 (scoffs)
I knew she'd cry.
 I won't cry.
 Even though you're kind of
a nerd who thinks it's okay
 To wear "sensible shoes,"
 The truth is,
 We really think
you're a great teacher.
 So, here.
 Don't cry.
 I won't.
 (chuckles)
 It's, like, for the baby.
 Okay,
 You should get off the bus.
 Mm-hmm... (clear throat)
 Yeah.
 (phone rings)
 Hello?
 Ms. Villanueva,
this is sister margaret.
 Oh, oh, is this about the gift?
 Because if I'm not allowed
to accept gifts,
 I will return it immediately.
(chuckles) no, no.
 This is because I'd like
to offer you a permanent job.
 What?
 Another teacher is pregnant.
 We thought you could trail her
until you graduate
 And then cover
her maternity leave.
 Then when she comes back,
you can take yours
 With the promise
 Of a permanent position
in our middle school
 Wait, is-is this
about the jane the virgin coins?
 No, ms. Villanueva.
 This is because
the students gave you
 The highest score
on your teacher evaluations.
 They did?
 (sniffling)
 Are you crying, ms. Villanueva?
 Yes.
 But to be fair,
 It's been building up
for a while.
 Okay, great, cut.
 You can say it next time, diego.
 (chuckles)
 Santos is a priest?
 It's a flashback sequence.
He has since left the cloth
 And made love
to hundreds of women.
 (laughter)
 Okay, everyone!
 Jane is here;
gather round, please.
 Gather round. Yes.
 Wait, wait, what are
we gathering around for?
 You will see.
 (clears throat)
friends,
 Workers, as you all know,
 Like kanye west,
 I have recently acquired
a daughter.
 What you don't know
 Is that my daughter, jane,
 Is the new writer's intern
 For the passions of santoyes!
 Yes.
 I don't know what to say.
 "thank you" is fine.
 It's just, I didn't ask
for the job, though.
 (chuckles)
you don't have to.
 Everybody wants to work
 On television.
 (laughter)
 Can I talk to you in private
for a moment?
 Yeah, sure. Nicolas.
 (whistles) everyone out!
 Rogelio:
See you later,
 My excellent teammates.
 Jane?
Hm?
 I am an actor.
 I am trained to read emotions,
 And you don't seem
 100% happy with the internship.
 Uh, I just didn't see it coming.
 I wanted to surprise you,
you know?
 And you're gonna be
done teaching in a week.
 No, they asked me to stay on.
 Oh!
 But don't you want
to be a writer?
 Yeah, I-I just never thought
about telenovelas.
 I mean, I don't know
if I'm gonna be any good at it.
 You will be good.
 You are my daughter.
 Talent courses
through your veins.
 (chuckles)
 It would be kind of cool
to try it.
 Don't let yourself
 Get swept up
by glamor, jane.
 I offered you
a terrific position.
 Just think of all the
fabulous scenes you will write.
 Sister margaret:
Think of all the lives
 You'll touch.
 But writing is her dream.
 Dreams don't pay the bills.
 Geez. At least her see
if she likes it.
 She already knows
she likes teaching.
 Trust me, she will like
this much, much more.
 No, she won't, you silly actor.
 Jane,
 What'll it be?
 Teaching.
Tell her, jane.
 Writing.
 Jane?
Huh?
 So, what do you think?
 Latin lover narrator:
You'll recall,
 Our jane has always
avoided conflict.
 I think I can do them both,
for now.
 Latin lover narrator:
I don't want to spoil things,
 But...
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that rogelio
was bursting with pride
 That jane had
decided to, as he put it,
 "give the family business
a try."
 Dina:
Aah! You moron!
 Oh, no. Maybe
we should just wait.
 Okay. Hi.
 Dina, hello, hello!
 We are here!
 Jane, so nice to meet you.
 I will leave you to get to know
my brilliant daughter.
 Kisses!
 Mwah!
 So, you know,
if you need anything--
 Food runs, just let me know.
 Oh, we're actually
 In the middle of a story problem
for tomorrow's episode.
 Please stay.
Steven, recap. Go.
 Okay, uh, santos
has just escaped,
 But obviously,
he's still the president,
 So he needs to find a way
off the island
 Without being recognized.
 Any ideas, jane? Because
there are no bad ideas here.
 Ricky:
What if he makes himself
 A mask out of,
like, mud and twigs?
 Except for yours, ricky.
 Jane? What do you think?
 Headshot rogelio:
Go ahead, jane.
 It'll be brilliant.
 Um...
 I don't know if this is what
 You were looking for,
 But maybe santos could be
dressed as a beggar?
 Huh! El presidente would never
dress as a beggar!
 Because it would be
unexpected, see?
 No one would expect him
to demean himself like that.
 Hmm.
 Not bad.
 Let's put it in the
script and move on.
 Good work, jane.
 Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted
 That at this very moment,
 Jane felt butterflies
in her stomach.
 And I'm not going lie.
 It felt like a sign.
 And they're putting one of
my lines in the script.
 That's great!
I know! I can't
believe it.
 Favorite movie?
Dirty dancing.
 One topic not
to bring up?
Selena.
 Both the singer and j. Lo's
portrayal of her in the movie.
 Birth sign?
Come on!
 You seriously expect me to
remember your mom's birth sign?
 If it was in the e-mail,
 I'm gonna need you
to remember it.
 I know. I'm sorry.
I'm so stressed.
 I just really want
this to go well.
 I know, and it will.
 Parents love me.
 Mm-hmm.
I rarely curse, and I have
excellent table manners.
 Hmm.
 Mm...
 You seem tired.
 Maybe you should
slow down.
 No, I'm fine.
 All this running around
between waitressing
 And teaching,
and now the telenovela...
 You can't keep this up forever.
 You got to make a decision
before it catches up with you.
 And our peach.
 According to baby center,
it is now an apple,
 Rounding the corner
to avocado.
 Both:
Mmm.
 Uh-uh.
Let's not lose focus.
 Come on, we're in
the home stretch.
 Look, what's my grandma's
favorite tv show?
 Sabado gigante.
Xiomara:
I'm just saying that
 If we cancel with rafael, you'll
get to watch sabado gigante.
 (phone buzzing,
xiomara sighs)
ah.
 Because he wants
to make dinner plans,
 And I don't want to see him.
 Latin lover narrator:
Well, that's not exactly true.
 Xo really, really
wanted to see him.
 I made a promise to god, okay?
 When you were hurt
in the hospital.
 Latin lover narrator: Of course,
alba knew this already.
 I promise
if you take care of ma,
 I won't let a man between
these legs again without a ring.
 Latin lover narrator:
But xo didn't know
alba knew that.
 I know, I know-- that's why
I've been avoiding rogelio.
 Mm.
(door opens)
 Jane:
We're here.
 Don't worry.
 Latin lover narrator:
But alba was worried.
 But, thanks to jane's
careful preparation,
 Rafael was performing
brilliantly at dinner.
 As I was saying, I believe
 That hard work
is the key to success.
 I mean, as a taurus,
 You must know what I mean.
 Persistence
is everything.
 Hmm.
 Xiomara:
You look tired, hon.
 Are you leaning more towards
teaching or interning?
 I don't know.
 I'm going back and forth.
 Ma, don't pressure her.
 I know.
Xiomara:
But, hon,
 You want to be a writer.
You said you got butterflies.
 Ma, if she doesn't
chase down her dream,
 She'll always regret it.
 I totally agree.
 Anyway,
 I have time to sort
it out, so...
 Your mom is right.
 Life is short.
 We spend all our time working.
 It should be spent
doing something that you love.
 Besides, all the other stuff--
the baby and the bills--
 You know I'll take
care of that.
 What do you mean,
you'll take care of it?
 Oh, I was... I was just
agreeing with you,
 That she should
take the internship,
 And she shouldn't make
a decision about money.
 Because...
 I can help out there.
 Latin lover narrator:
To be fair,
 Jane had not told rafael
not to offer any money.
 But only because
she never thought
 He'd do something so stupid.
 I don't think
jane's asking for your help.
 Uh, yeah, I-I know that.
 And I know she's not
gonna take your money.
 Mom, just calm down.
 I am calm.
I just don't like the idea
 That he thinks
we'll take handouts.
 That's not what I meant.
 We work hard, all of us do.
 I understand that,
but I'm still going
 To take care of
the baby financially.
 Good. You should.
 And if jane needs anything...
 Her family will
take care of her.
 And we are going to be family.
 I'm the father of her baby.
 Not on purpose.
 (clears throat)
 Okay, he's gone.
 What was all
that about?
 I could ask you
the same thing.
 You guys were actually agreeing.
 You both want me
to make a decision.
 And that's your decision?
 To let him pay for everything?
 No, of course not.
 I mean, if I decide
to take the internship,
 I'm gonna keep waitressing.
 I'm not afraid of hard work,
you know that.
 Rafael doesn't.
 Stop, mom.
 He was trying
to be supportive.
 And yeah, he said
something... Stupid,
 But instead of letting
it go, you drilled down.
 I mean, what is wrong with you?
Why won't you give him a chance?
 You know why.
 I just don't see
you guys together.
 Because you're not trying.
 Why can't you at least try?
 You still love her, don't you?
 We belong together.
 And I'll never stop
believing that.
 Jane:
Mom?
 What is it?
 I-it just feels like
being disloyal to michael.
 What?
 You were with him
 Two years.
 Yeah.
 But... I've moved on
 And he's moved on.
 No, he hasn't.
 What are you talking about?
 Nothing, it doesn't matter.
 The point is that
 Michael was like part of
the family for a long time.
 And I get that everything
has changed for you, but...
 You gotta give me a second
to catch up.
 I get it.
 But that doesn't mean
 That you can be rude to rafael.
 You're right.
 I'll apologize tomorrow.
 Lachlan:
She lives!
 I came in yesterday.
I called you a couple of times.
 Yeah, I'm sorry,
I've-I've been...
 A little under the weather.
 I'm in a hurry, actually.
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?
 Picking up my check.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.
 Petra, what's...
What's going on?
 Please, tell me.
 Okay, so this guy, ivan,
 He's been blackmailing you?
 Exactly.
 And when he learned
that we wouldn't be able
 To pay him any longer...
 Well, we, uh...
 We had a misunderstanding.
 Latin lover narrator:
To be clear:
 She took him hostage.
 He escaped.
 And I'm scared he'll
tell milos where I am.
 I know... I know this
all sounds crazy.
 It is crazy.
 I feel crazy.
 Cooped up in
my room, scared,
 Just waiting for yellow
tulips to arrive...
 Tulips?
 Yeah.
 Milos used to
send me them
 Before he'd come
home from a trip.
 It was kind of
his calling card.
 That's why I've
been hiding out.
 And that's why
I have to leave.
 Let me come with you.
 What?
Listen to me.
 The maracay hotel group has
properties all over the world.
 I can ask to be transferred.
 Why?
 Petra, come on.
 You know how I feel about you.
 Okay, look,
 It's gonna take me
a couple of days
 To work out the arrangements.
In the meantime,
 I'm gonna have you moved up
to one of our penthouses.
 They have state-of-the-art
high-tech security systems,
 So you're gonna
be safe, okay?
 Look at me.
 I promise you.
 (knocking at door)
 Is this a bad time?
 Uh... No.
 No, uh, come in.
 Wow.
 Incredible view.
 Yeah. It was kind of
a selling point of the place.
 Uh, do you want to...
Do you want to sit?
 Yeah, sure.
 Let's sit.
 I just wanted to apologize.
 I was really rude last night.
 I overreacted and I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry, too.
 Things just escalated.
 Exactly.
You know, but
I have to say,
 It doesn't seem like
you like me very much.
 Latin lover narrator:
She doesn't.
Let's just be honest.
 So we can get to the root of it.
 Latin lover narrator:
Never a good idea.
Okay.
 Latin lover narrator:
I wouldn't say it.
 I just don't think
you're right for jane.
 Why?
 It's just...
 A character thing, if you
really want to know the truth.
 You don't know my character.
I know
 You kissed her and you didn't
 Call her back
and she was crushed.
 That was five years ago!
 Still speaks to character.
 You're not being fair, okay?
 People change.
 Not fundamentally.
 And you guys are different
 In every regard.
 You see the world differently
 I'm sorry, but you have
 No idea how I see the world.
 Maybe not.
 But I know that you see it
from up here.
 With this incredible view.
 (phone whooshes, buzzes)
 I have to go.
 No problem.
Uh...
 Let's just... Can we...?
 Can we talk about this later?
 El presidente, uh...
 Latin lover narrator:
Note that jane had hurried
to the stage
 So she could watch them
film the scene idea
 She had come up with.
 Santos disguised
 As a beggar.
 A pirate beggar?
 That's weird.
 And jane realized exactly
what had happened.
 Did you tell the writers
to act like they liked my idea?
 Uh... Are you
enjoying your new job?
 Rogelio, did you?
 Yes, I did.
 But it was to give
you confidence.
 You said you didn't know if
you'd be any good at writing.
 And believing in yourself
is the hardest part.
 I get that,
and-and that's sweet.
 But I have
 This big life choice to make
between teaching and writing.
 And I'm just really trying
to figure out if I have talent
 Because that matters.
 Say no more.
 I completely understand.
 Thank you.
 So, write me a scene.
 What?
 I can tell you
if you have talent.
 I don't usually read
unsolicited manuscripts,
 But since your my daughter,
I'm gonna make an exception.
 (quiet laugh)
 So, theses are the plans?
Yeah.
 Signed by me, signed by
your dad. What's this about?
 It's about the fact
that there was a tunnel
 Found inside the hotel leading
 From here in the recovery suites
 To here... Under the hotel.
 What?
 You had nothing to do with it?
 No! This is news to me.
 All right.
 Look at those bathrooms.
 Is that your work?
 Yeah.
 Well, not this one. No.
 See how the tiling there is
just... A little different.
 Maybe a subcontractor.
Who?
 Don't know.
 Your dad could've hired anyone.
 Hey.
 I know who did that
other bathroom.
 And for a small fee,
 I'd be happy to give you
his name and address.
 So, I hear you're
 Writing a scene.
 Yup. About a pirate.
Just not quite sure
 How to not make it sound...
Ridiculous.
 Oh, you just got to find
something you relate to.
 At least that's
what I tell myself.
 Oh, you're a writer, too?
An actor.
 You know, your dad,
he's been, uh,
 He's been
really helpful, actually.
 Haven't booked
anything yet, but...
 I'm sure you will.
 Yeah. I hope so.
 Anyway...
 You have to find a way
 To empathize with
your character.
 Relate to the pirate.
 Latin lover narrator:
And so, jane tried her best
 To relate to the pirate.
 But that turned out
to be ridiculous advice.
 However, jane did manage
 To write
a pretty cute scene anyway,
 In my entirely
unbiased opinion.
 And as she wrote,
 The butterflies returned.
 And speaking of butterflies...
 (doorbell rings)
 I've never seen you so...
 Casual. Yeah.
 I'm keeping it casual tonight.
 Interesting.
 You know, I'm not usually a fan
 Of the whole
"less is more" thing.
 But looking at you right now?
 Less is just...
 Estimulante.
 Right, so I thought
 Maybe we could order pizza?
 Great.
 And after maybe
we can make love.
 Let's start with a pizza.
 Wow. That's a lot of garlic
you're putting on there.
 I just love garlic.
Me, too.
 You know, it's funny.
Some people don't like
 To kiss after garlic.
 I don't have that problem.
 Latin lover narrator:
Working up the courage
to tell rogelio
 About her vow of chastity
was proving harder
 Than xiomara had anticipated.
 Yes, more wine.
 That will help.
 Let me grab another bottle.
 So, listen, I did want
 To talk to you about something.
 Do you remember
when we first met, xiomara?
 Yeah. In biology class.
 You kept making
those dumb jokes.
 You laughed at
those dumb jokes.
 Yeah, I did.
 You look exactly
the same, xiomara.
 I mean it.
 I look at you tonight
and it's like
 No time has passed.
 Oh!
 Oh, me, too.
 (both scream)
 You have to go!
 Why? Why? Why? Â¿que paso?
 Â¿que?
Oh, my god...
 Â¿que paso? Que?
Go.
 Yeah, but I didn't
tell him the reason, ma.
 I just freaked out.
 Because I really like him.
 And once he finds out
 That, you know...
My charms are off-limits...
 I don't know
if he'll be interested.
 I thought you loved rogelio.
 I can't thank you enough.
 I finally feel safe.
 You should.
 No one gets on this
floor unnoticed.
 The windows are too big in here.
Mother!
 Draw the blinds, magda.
 All right.
 Call me if you need anything.
 Don't be rude, mother.
 He's the only person
who's helping us.
 And I still don't trust him.
 Well, I do. And...
 You're my mother, so you
just have to get on board.
 Rogelio:
I am on board.
 "I am completely on board."
 Ah!
 Oh, I see.
 You brought that theme back.
 Plus, you know, it's,
like, a play on words.
 Because you're
"on board" the ship.
 Ah! Clever.
 Latin lover narrator:
Truth be told,
this was the first time
 In jane's life that she had
sought her father's approval.
 All right, I'm finished.
 And she wanted it very badly.
 I don't like it.
What?
 Well, I'm sorry.
 You asked me to be honest.
 You said it was important.
 It is, but what did you
not like about it exactly?
 Well, a pirate would
never say these things.
 Oh, okay. I mean, do you know
a lot of pirates or...?
 And second and
most importantly,
 Telenovelas are
all about drama.
 You know-- yelling,
crying, scheming.
 And there's none
of that in here.
 I'm sorry. Are you angry?
 No.
 I mean...
 It stings, but...
 I wanted you
to tell me the truth.
 I have to make a decision.
 I just really loved writing it.
 I-I mean, I got butterflies.
 Well, that is important.
 You know, passion is important.
 Yeah, but if I'm not talented...
Oh, stop.
 Every new skill takes time.
 You can't expect to be
an expert overnight.
 Hey. You sound tired.
 (yawning):
I'm not.
 Jane, come on.
 You can't keep up this schedule.
 I know. I'm trying
to figure it out.
 Did my mom ever apologize
to you, by the way?
 (stammers)
kind of.
 (jane groans)
 No.
It's fine.
 It's a process.
We'll get there.
 No, I just hate it when people
in my life don't get along.
 It just makes me all anxious.
 Anxious? Why?
 I don't know.
 My mom and my grandma
fought a lot growing up.
 And I just always
wanted to fix things.
 I get that.
 But some things just take time.
 Yeah. Giving things time
is not my strong suit.
 Well, then you got to try, huh?
 And don't worry,
we will get there.
 We have to.
 Because I am not going anywhere.
 Oh, that's so sweet.
 Can you say that again
for my mom?
 (laughs)
look, I'm gonna go.
 Just text me
when you get home, okay?
 Okay.
 Bye.
 All right. Bye.
 Latin lover narrator:
Truth be told,
 Part of the reason
 Rafael's problems with xiomara
didn't phase him
 Were that they seemed
slightly insignificant
 Compared to the fact
 That his father could be
sin rostro.
 Can I help you?
 Yeah, I, uh,
 I know you were hired to do
 The bathroom work
at the marbella.
 (laughs):
Who the hell are you?
 Just hoping that maybe if you
could tell me who hired you,
 I could... Make it
worth your while.
 (laughs)
 (camera shutter clicking)
 I'm only gonna
say this once.
 Get the hell off
my property.
 Someone was just here,
asking questions.
 Call me back.
 (passing car honking horn)
 (car honks horn)
 (groans)
 Who the hell are you?
 Oh, I'm looking for andy.
 Are you with
that other guy?
 Wha...?
 (thuds)
 It was just a little
fender bender.
 But my mom freaked out.
Because you're pregnant.
 Of course you
needed to come.
 (heart beating over monitor)
doctor: The heartbeat, good.
 That's a good sign.
 You see? I told you.
 Jane, I want to
tell you something,
 And I am serious
about it.
 Oh, maybe not now.
 No, now.
 You are taking
on too much.
 Between waitressing and teaching
and now this internship,
 It's too much--
you can't do it all.
 You gotta make a choice.
 I completely agree.
 Hey, look at
you two-- friends.
 Latin lover narrator:
And just then,
 The butterflies came back.
 Do you feel the baby kicking?
 What? No, not yet.
 It's happening now.
 (gasps)
sometimes it's hard
to tell at first,
 But my wife said it felt like
butterflies in her stomach.
 That's the baby kicking?
 I feel it.
 Rafael: Wait, uh,
where, where?
 My turn, my turn.
 What were you doing
following rafael?
 I know he's involved.
And you were told
specifically to back off.
 But, nadine, right before
I went in, there was a guy
 Making a call-- I wrote down the
number, and guess who picked up.
 Plastic surgeon.
 It's got to be the one
working with sin rostro.
 Redoing the faces.
 I am on to something here,
you gotta believe me.
 It's not enough
to believe you,
 I'm also gonna have
to lie for you.
 Armstrong called.
 (groans)
he wanted to know
what happened to you.
 Can't you just say
you don't know?
 But I do know.
 Just tell me that this
isn't about jane,
 That you're not spiraling
because of jane.
 It's not about jane.
 I promise you.
 Okay. Okay.
 Xiomara, how's jane?
 She's fine, the baby's fine,
everything's fine.
 Thank god.
 Xiomara, what is it?
 First last night,
and now as we hug.
 Why are you so afraid to
have your pelvis touch mine?
 Here's the thing:
 I took a vow
of chastity.
 What?!
Yeah.
 I-I'm gonna give it a try.
(anxious laugh)
 And, well, anyway,
I-I just wanted you to know.
 And I don't expect you
to stick around, okay?
 Because this is my thing.
 Of course I'll
stick around.
 You are worth waiting for.
 Any idea,
 Like, you know, on
a rough timeframe?
 I'll keep you posted.
 (gasps)
 Tulips?
 Milos used to send me them
 Before he'd come
home from a trip.
 It was kind of
his calling card.
 (cell phone buzzes)
 Hello?
 Yes, this is she.
 What kind of...?
 Okay, thank you.
 Is everything okay?
 It's michael.
 (knocking on door)
 Jane.
 What are you doing here?
 I'm still your
emergency contact.
 I guess.
(chuckles)
 And I was here, too, so...
 Is everything okay?
 Yes, it was just a car accident.
 What?!
A minor one.
 It was nothing, really.
 You're okay? The baby's okay?
 Yeah. Yeah,
we're okay.
 Good.
 What happened to you?
 Bruised ribs.
 Small concussion.
 Occupational hazard.
 What?
 I don't know.
 This.
 Seems kind of like
a sign, you know?
 You and me in the same hospital.
 At the same time.
 Latin lover narrator: It felt
like a sign to jane as well.
 Only, a different one.
 Michael, you're not waiting
for me, are you?
 For us?
 Of course I am.
 I love you, jane.
 I love you now,
and I'll love you forever.
 And whatever's going on
with you and rafael,
 It's not gonna last.
 You're wrong.
 Really?
 So you're trying
to tell me that,
 At the end of the day,
 That's who you see
yourself with?
 Rafael?
 Latin lover narrator:
Perhaps if nadine had heard
the words jane was saying,
 And not just seen the look
in michael's eyes,
 She wouldn't have done
what she did next.
 But she did not hear.
 I'll change my
emergency contact.
 Hi, lieutenant armstrong.
 I have some information
on detective cordero
 That you need to hear.
 Latin lover narrator:
Ah, irony.
 He disobeyed your direct order.
 Latin lover narrator:
What a cruel mistress.
 Good morning, mom!
 Ah, buenos dÃ­a.
 No, I didn't.
 But I talked to rogelio
about it last night,
 And he was sweet
and understanding,
 And he said that he will wait
 Until I decide
it's the right time.
 I know,
you were right.
 Latin lover narrator:
Uh-oh.
 How do you know exactly
what I said to god?
 I won't let a man
 Between these legs again
without a ring.
 Uh-uh, those were
my exact words.
 Bueno.
 You what?!
 Yeah.
 Maybe.
 But still it
was wrong.
 An apology letter? Why?
 Hey, you two.
 So...
(clears throat)
 I, uh, just
talked to rafael.
 And I made a decision.
 I'm taking the teaching job.
 Look, if I
had a talent
 For writing telenovelas,
that'd be one thing.
 But I don't, so...
 I made my choice.
 Well, those kids are
lucky to have you.
 Xiomara: What apology letters
are you talking about, mom?
 I haven't
written you any.
 Remember...
 It was for a good cause.
 Latin lover narrator:
Which brings us here, now,
 Where jane walks
with a heavy heart,
 Ready to say farewell
to writing, for the time being.
 Jane!
 Hey, dina.
 Do you need something?
 I wanted to just tell you
I really enjoyed your scene.
 What scene?
The one you wrote
for rogelio.
 Nicholas slipped
it to me.
 For a first timer,
you show a lot of potential.
 Wow, really?
 But rogelio said
it wasn't very good.
 That's because there's not
a lot of yelling and crying.
 Trust me.
 I get paid to know
good writing.
 Keep working at it.
 I'm scared, lachlan--
I don't know what to do.
 Those yellow tulips,
it means that milos is here.
 I just don't understand
what happened.
 I posted a permanent
private guard at your door.
 I promise I will
keep you safe.
 So I made a decision.
 If you're quitting, you don't
have to let me down easy.
 I understand.
 Teaching is...
 Well, someone has
to do it, right?
 I'm not quitting.
 I was going to, but dina...
 She thinks I have talent,
and that's all I needed to hear.
 You know, the
baby's coming.
 This is my chance.
 I'm glad you're staying.
 But, jane, this is
a tough business.
 You can't look to others
to validate you.
 If you choose to make
a living in the financial arts,
 You must believe in yourself.
 You know, that's really
good advice, rogelio.
 Latin lover narrator:
It really, really was.
 All right...
 She's staying on here.
 Perfect.
 Latin lover narrator:
In fact, it was advice
 Rogelio would need himself,
in the weeks to come.
 Rogelio won't know what hit him.
 I don't like this, not one bit.
