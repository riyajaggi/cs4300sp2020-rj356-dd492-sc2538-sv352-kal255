You... you can go if you want, it's fine. What? No. What? I'm not done here yet. Honeybear, we're gonna just leave our stuff in the car. Can you watch it for us? 'Cause I don't trust these stoned-ass fools right now. Yeah, I got you. Wait, you guys aren't coming? Um, I'm gonna be on, uh, street patrol duty! I'll be watching. Camille, my backpack! Yo, you know I never fucking lose anything. Like, that's some weird shit! I'm known for not losing shit, but I'm here losing shit. Plus, I'm starving. Like, this shit... This whole situation, it's just hard, man. How is it hard, bro? You're just sitting in a van, getting high. Whatever. Whatever. Wait... Yo, Farouk, what are these foo-ass Supreme shirts? Yo, don't worry about it, buddy. That's easy money right there. Hey, don't touch the merchandise, man. Farouk, what kind of weed is this by the way? Chill out back there, Snoop Dogg. Man, you never buy shit. Fuck, it's the free kind, man. - This shit different. - Pass it, dude. Yo, what are you doing back there, man? You eating it? Still don't get why you got these bum-ass T-shirts... Yo, stop touching my shit. Don't open it. Don't open it. - You're lowering the value. - Let me see, bro. You got so many. They're all fake anyway, son. - [laughter] - This costs like $2 to make. Now you fucking with my money, man. Oh, Supreme, oh... Wait, look!

You don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. - That could be true, but... - [laughs] Just bring back the money. Is this shit lit? Yo, where the fuck is PJ? - Who? - PJ! Trying to get this fucking sh-money. - Sh-money? - Sh-money. - Bread, the dope, the dinner roll. - Yeah, I get it, buddy. Oh... [laughs] Hey, Indigo. Hey. Have you ever skated before? Nah. Well, maybe I could teach you how sometime. - [snorts] - [laughter] What the fuck are you laughing at? I teach women how to skateboard. Yeah, if y'all think that's funny, y'all got a problem. Whoa, whoa. Uh, I think we're laughing because it seemed like Kirt was trying to get with Indigo. - Yeah. - Well, I wasn't. It's not my fault if my "let's skate" and my "let's smash" vibes got some overlap. Well, I don't know about skating, 'cause, like, I'm into chill shit. But it is chill. It's so fun. Nah. I don't want a bunch of... I don't need a bunch of guys - watching me fall on my ass all day. - But that's the thing. Skateboarding is not about landing tricks all the time, that's why girls are so intimidated, they think that's what they need to do, like... it's just about having fun, it doesn't matter how many tricks you have. Yeah, but it helps. It helps a lot. Yo, don't listen to him, though. He's a boy, he doesn't count. She's not wrong, though.

You skate now? - Yeah, it's whatever. - Be safe, yo. - Yeah, see you later. - All right. Why you looking at me like that? Hey, Tony Hawk, guess what? Nobody holds their trucks on their skateboard! How the fuck do I hold it? You acting mad cool, you just... [laughing] Hold it like this, like you? Mm, I'm Kirt. How I hold my skateboard. Ah, ah. This is my purse. - [laughs] - It's my new purse. Do you love it? It's cute, right? [laughter] Oh, look, look! I guess they didn't change the doorknob after all. Thank you girls so much. Here's a butterscotch. Oh, it's okay. We're... we're good.

He was like coming at you. - I know! - He thought you were cute. He thought you were cute. Why you still have it in your hand? Throw that out. It probably has, like, razor blades in it or something. I know. [groans] That stuff is so creepy, man. Gosh. It reminds me of, like, when I would take the bus to school and there was this one bus driver who would just always say things like, "Oh, you're getting prettier and prettier. Ew! Oh, if you were just ten years older." All that bullshit. - Did you tell your parents? - No, I... no. Why not? I don't know, I... I didn't want to get him in trouble and... I guess I was just... I just thought he was being nice, you know? [sighs] That's why we have boards, so we don't have to take the bus. We don't need to talk to anybody. Just hop on our board, we're out. Yo, that is like the most important shit, right, like... - Water? - What? - No. Water? - The most important shit. - I don't even drink water. - Ew. How the fuck are you still alive? - I just eat fruit, man. - That's gross. You don't need water. It's a myth. Yes, you do! No, all you have to do is eat fruit, man. Watermelon, hello. You can't survive off of watermelon. Yeah, watermelon and hot dogs, buddy. But, no, for real, you know what the most important thing is? - Family. - No fucking way. - What? - What, you see the backpack? - That's my fucking uncle. - What? Where? - What? - Uncle Rick! Yo, call me when you find my phone. I'll be back. What? He has his fucking phone. Classic Phil, dude. - Dumb-ass. - He always does that shit. He's so smacked. Yeah, well... Yo, yo, Kirt, Kirt.
