 You know the new word of mouth is the internet, right? Camille, let me get that backpack. ‐All my shit's in there. ‐Uh... I think I forgot it at the park. ‐Look, look, look. ‐Let's go catch that bitch. And then once we catch them, you can get us into Winter Bowl, deal? ‐Fine. Come on, let's go. ‐Yeah, okay.

 We're good. Oh, you have a key. That's cool. Is it yours? Yeah, she's cool. She can come in. All right. You're good to go. Skrrt. ‐Camille? ‐What am I supposed to do? Damn, that bitch is cold. All right. If you have anything else you need washed, speak up; I'm only doing one more load. ‐ I do my own laundry, remember? ‐ Well, you ready to pay your own rent too? ‐ No. That's why I'm still here. ‐ What's up with you two? ‐ What is in this thing? ‐ What are you doing? I told you

 I don't want people in my stuff. ‐ Oh, so now I'm "people." When I made you that grilled cheese this morning, I was "Dad." ‐ Elizabeth, where you off to? ‐ Nowhere. I'm just going out. ‐ Take this with you. ‐ I'm vegetarian, Grandma. ‐ No, you not. ‐ I knew a vegetarian once. She die. I want a big smile. A bigger one. A louder one. Bye. ‐ Bro, you fucking violated that guy. ‐ I just scared him a little bit. ‐ It's okay. What's a grown‐ass man doing eating a ice cream cone, anyways? ‐ Everyone eats ice cream, Kirt. ‐ True. Whatever. Can we get away from these bum‐ass tourists, though? ‐ Mm, let's just stay here. I don't feel like having a bunch of thirsty‐ass skater dudes looking at me. ‐ Would you rather it be thirsty‐ass skater dudes or thirsty‐ass that guy? ‐ The cat is so cute, though! ‐ Nah, that shit is cute, bro. ‐ It's mad cute. ‐ In case of emergency, listen for announcements and instructions from the bridge. Please familiarize yourself with the location of life jackets on this‐‐ ‐ So, Janay, you had a crazy morning. ‐ Damn right, Donald. ‐ Tell us about it. Please, tell us about it. ‐ I did. I'm back with my experience. ‐ Okay. ‐ W‐where do I even start? Like... ‐ At the beginning, girl. ‐ I ended up on a tour in my own neighborhood with a gang of Japanese hipsters... ‐ Oh, no. ‐ And white people in shorts. We were on what they call the "Brooklyn... Edge Graffiti Experience." ‐ Tell us about your experience. ‐ I'ma tell you. So for 20 minutes, right, we stared at a mural depicting Biggie Smalls' final day, which, according... ‐ Okay. ‐ To our tour guide, Josh, was..."raw." It's so visceral. It was shit. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Right? And then also‐‐ hold on, hold on‐‐ our last stop was this Caribbean spot that I used to go to... ‐ Yeah, yeah, uh‐huh, uh‐huh. ‐ All the time with my dad. You remember that spot, right? ‐ Yeah, I do. ‐ Now it's a new, authentic bistro. ‐ New and authentic? ‐ How cool is that? ‐ Authentic sounds delicious. I can't lie. ‐ Not delicious enough to erase an entire neighborhood. ‐ Well‐‐ ‐ You've gone too far when you put picture frames around bullet holes, which this spot had. Ah! ‐ No, it's new and authentic! It's new and authentic! ‐ No, stop! I need to ask you all a question at home real quick. Why is it that you hate graffiti in your neighborhoods but will pay good money to see it and look at it in mine? ‐ Please answer that question. ‐ Need to know. Are the comments disabled? ‐ Um... ‐ I'm trying to... ‐ Yes. ‐ Why? ‐ Um... a couple trolls just crawled out from under they bridges, and I just‐‐ I just cut it off. I just cut 'em off. ‐ Every video has trolls. That doesn't mean you just... ‐ I know that. ‐ Go and turn the comments off because a few fools are talking shit. ‐ I know. I‐‐they were‐‐but they were, like, talking mad shit. Like, it was unnecessary. ‐ So what? It doesn't even matter, because our comments equals engagement equals our views. ‐ Okay, yes, I know, but they were talking mad shit about you. ‐ So? ‐ Look, just let me keep them off until it, like, dies down a little bit, and then that's that. I can't help but be a little bit protective of you. I'm sorry. ‐ I don't need you to protect me. ‐ I know‐‐ ‐ You're not my dad. ‐ I know I'm not your dad. Okay? I... but I am more like your twin brother, so... ‐ You know, sometimes I wish you were my actual twin. ‐ That is precious, Janay. That is the sweetest thing you've ever said to me. ‐ 'Cause then I would've just eaten you in the womb. ‐ And that is so dark. ‐ And then the comments would be on... ‐ That is just dire. ‐ Oh, come on! ‐ I'm already over it. ‐ Yo, it's fine! It's gonna be fine. Yo, it's gonna be mad fun. ‐ You still mad about the Winter Bowl thing? Guess so! ‐ Yo, she's mad annoying. We looked for her bag all day, and she just went to go chill with those fuckboys. Come on, I'ma teach you how to go down this ramp. ‐ What? ‐ Is that Bambi's new video? ‐ Yo, Milton does the sickest wallrides right here. ‐ Yo, homey gives zero fucks. ‐ Yo, is that Bambi's new video? ‐ Yo, Mike. I'm right here, bro. ‐ Eww, Charlie, what's on your shirt? You always fall for it every single‐‐ ‐ Hardies. ‐ You gonna hit me? ‐ Can't violate you right now. ‐ 'Cause I'm a girl? ‐ No, 'cause I fucked up my hand yesterday. ‐ Man... ‐ Yo, guys, this bracelet right here, this girl in Utah, she gave it to me. She was mad different, yo. After she gave it to me, she jumped into the hot tub at the gym... ‐ "She jumped into the hot tub at the gym..." ‐ with all her clothes on. ‐ "With all her clothes on." ‐ Even her shoes? ‐ Yes. ‐ Yes. ‐ Okay. ‐ Okay. ‐ I know what you doing. ‐ I know what you doing. ‐ 'Sup, boys? ‐ Yo! ‐ Oh, shit! ‐ Speak of the devil. ‐ Ka‐shh! ‐ You know me, bro. ‐ Yeah, baby, tag it. Everything! ‐ I bet you won't do this. ‐ Bet you won't do this. Yo! ‐ Hi, Camille. ‐ Hey. What's up? ‐ Yo, you guys want to play S‐K‐A‐T‐E? ‐ No. ‐ No, come on! It's H‐O‐R‐S‐E‐‐ it's like H‐O‐R‐S‐E, but it's S‐K‐A‐T‐E. Okay, here. You can hold on to me. ‐ Ah‐‐ ‐ Yeah! Nice! ‐ Fuck, yeah. ‐ Mm‐hmm! ‐ Ah! Ugh. ‐ Hey. ‐ You know those Betties, don't you? ‐ No, not really. I saw your last video, and I was just wondering, do you, like, hear a song and then you just know that that's a song for the clip, or do you cut up the clip first, and then lay a song over it? ‐ Depends. I mean, sometimes there's something that I've been wanting to use or something that, like, I like, or something I liked when I was a kid, and... you know, if it fits, it fits. Editing is important, too. ‐ Yeah! Yo, I love when, um, like, someone lands, and the beat goes with it. I don't know. ‐ Yeah. ‐ I think that's cool. But I've been watching your videos since I started skating. ‐ So, like, six months ago? ‐ No. I been skating for, like, ten years. I... What? ‐ I know. I've been watching. You're good. ‐ Thank you. Let me get a cigarette. Wait, but... my finger might touch the other ones. Is that okay? Like, you're gonna put your mouth‐‐I didn't want... you know, your mouth to touch... Thank you. ‐ You look perfect. Can you lean back a little bit, though? Stand up straight. Yeah. Can you do one with your hair just all behind you? Perfect. Ah, you look great. Ah, that's perfect. ‐ What the fuck? ‐ Oh, yes. ‐ Why are you taking her picture? ‐ I'm casting for a national campaign, and I'm looking for skaters, and she would be perfect. ‐ "Tovah O'Malley Casting." ‐ That's me. ‐ Okay, cool. Well, my name is Janay, and this is Kirt. ‐ Yo, I'll do it, but I can't wear dresses! I gotta stay firm on that. ‐ Okay. You guys are so cute. I'm good for today. Maybe sometime in the future. But you, call me, okay? You have my number. Bye. ‐ Did that really just happen? Did you really just get scouted your first day at the skate park? ‐ I don't know. It's weird. ‐ This shit seems legit, bro. ‐ Yeah, but I'm not gonna do it. ‐ So then why did you let her take your picture? ‐ I'm vain. Okay. ‐ Damn! Yo, she just wild out. ‐ That's disgusting. ‐ That was some impressive shit. No pun intended. ‐ Literally! ‐ What? ‐ I'm referring to the fact that you just rolled through poo‐poo. ‐ Oh! ‐ Damn! ‐ Fuck! ‐ Yo, I got you. Come with me. ‐ Bambi, go help her clean that shit up. Yo, chill! Chill! ‐ Hey, I watched your show. I liked it. ‐ Oh, thanks, thanks! ‐ Nice job. ‐ Yeah, I love doing it. It's so fun. I have, like, a bunch of ideas, like, running through my head all the time. It's like, you know those people who get married on Reddit? Like, I wanna do one about them. Or, like, you know how sometimes you feel bad for your socks when you don't wear them for a while? ‐ Yes, do that one. Um, can I ask you a question? But don't take offense. ‐ Okay. ‐ Well, how close are you with Donald? ‐ Real‐‐we're really good friends. First boyfriend. Known him pretty much my whole life. Why? ‐ How do you deal with all the negative comments and stuff? ‐ Oh, yeah. Donald had said that there was some riff‐raff about that, but he handled it. ‐ Well... I took a screenshot. ‐ What the fuck? ‐ I'm sorry. ‐ That's why he turned off the fucking comments. I gotta go. ‐ Wait, can I have my phone? ‐ Yeah, sorry. Um, can you just keep this to yourself? ‐ Yeah, of course. You okay? ‐ Yeah, I'm fine. ‐ Yo, Honeybear! Yo, this is, um‐‐ What's your name again? ‐ Ash. ‐ This is Ash! Yo, good news. She is gay. She is! It's okay. She's just shy. ‐ Dig it! ‐ What up? ‐ Are you fucking serious? ‐ Yo, I'm sorry. ‐ The fuck is your problem? ‐ I'm sorry! ‐ Yo, back the fuck off, bro. She said sorry. ‐ You back the fuck up. The problem's with her, not you. ‐ Calm the fuck down. Don't tell me that shit, shrimp dick. The fuck did you just say? ‐ I said you got a shrimp dick! Shrimp dick! ‐ Okay, if you weren't a fucking female, I swear to God... Oh, my God. ‐ If I wasn't‐‐wah, wah, wah. What's up? ‐ All right, all right, all right. ‐ You hear this bitch? ‐ We're gonna have to get some backup, yo. Like, this chick's about to fuck up Luis! ‐ Yo, fuck you guys. You're all pussies! Oh, what? ‐ Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out of here! ‐ Yeah, push me! ‐ Get the fuck off me, bro! ‐ Fuck you guys. You're all pussies! You're all pussies. ‐ Get the fuck out of here. ‐ Yo! ‐ Indigo, where are you going? ‐ I'm going home, Kirt. ‐ Don't let that guy run you off. ‐ You said Zen. This was not Zen, and I don't want no part of that hostile bullshit. Keep the board. I'm done. ‐ Damn, that kind of sucked. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Hey, how come you ran away from that girl you liked earlier? ‐ I don't like her. ‐ Really? 'Cause it seems like you do. ‐ I don't like her. ‐ You too? Man, I hate when this shit happens. ‐ Hey! I need to talk to you. ‐ What? Whoa, watch out. ‐ Right now. ‐ Why? ‐ Right now! ‐ Okay, okay. Yo, I'll be right back. What's up? ‐ Bro, what the fuck? ‐ What? ‐ You said that you turned off the comments because people were talking about me, but that's not it. You lied. ‐ Fuck! ‐ Why would you lie? ‐ Yes, I lie‐‐okay. Fuck. Jeez. I lied. I lied. I said that. I don't... I don't‐‐fuck. I just have so much shit coming at me from all sides right now, Janay. I just really don't need it from you, too, okay? ‐ What the hell is going on? Fuck. ‐ Can you please just talk to me? ‐ I can't, man. I fucking can't. I'm like‐‐I'm just really afraid you're gonna think it's true. I don't want to tell you. ‐ Look, whatever it is, if it's something bad, even if it's something you feel like you did and you regret... ‐ I didn't do anything. ‐ It's fine. We'll get through it. ‐ I didn't do anything. Okay? Some girl caught feelings, and I didn't catch them back, and now she wants to destroy me, and she's just using this MeToo shit because she knows it'll work. That's it. ‐ But did you do anything? ‐ Janay. Jesus, man. Of course I didn't do anything. That's why I didn't want to tell you, because as soon as your name is linked with this shit, you're automatically guilty. Like, you're fucked for life. ‐ Okay, then you fight back. ‐ I ca‐‐ ‐ Make a video, and we could say what actually happened. ‐ That's not gonna work. ‐ Why not? ‐ 'Cause people don't want the truth, Janay. They just want a witch hunt, man. Like, I'm terrified. Being inside this, this is fucking scary. I could lose my job. I could lose our show. You think people want to watch a fucking YouTube show with a predator as a host? And anything I say will just make it worse. I'm just‐‐there's literally nothing I can do. I've tried to think of shit. ‐ Okay, well, then maybe there's something that I can do. Okay? Maybe I can do something. What's her name? ‐ I don't... ‐ Just tell me her name. ‐ You have a lot of plants. ‐ Plants are super important. They actually create a ton of oxygen. They're, like, constantly... regenerating the air. ‐ Well, wouldn't you need, like, a thousand plants for that to work? ‐ Well, these are succulents, so it's different. Hand me that screwdriver. Succulents. ‐ You can sit down. Oh. Sorry. I just... forgot. ‐ This is your new board, by the way. ‐ What? Really? I‐‐don't‐‐ don't play around with me like that if it's not my board. ‐ Relax. It's nothing. ‐ Well, okay. Thank you. That's really nice of you. You didn't have to do that. It's nice of you. So how did you get into skateboarding? ‐ I was kind of lost after my mom died. ‐ Oh. I didn't know. ‐ That's why they call me Bambi, 'cause my mom died in the woods. ‐ Really? ‐ No. But I was young, like in the movie, though. ‐ Yeah, I know about the movie. I never seen it, but... ‐ You've never seen "Bambi"? ‐ No, but I know what happens in it. Like, the mom deer dies, and the baby g‐‐ ‐ I've actually never seen it either, but don't tell anybody, 'cause... ‐ You sh‐‐you, of all people, should see the movie, 'cause your name's‐‐ ‐ You're all set. Thanks. It's nice. ‐ You read "The Alchemist," right? ‐ Hi, Indigo. Thanks for coming. ‐ I thought you were done. ‐ I was, until Kirt started textually harassing me. ‐ Look, Indigo, it's because I don't want you to stop skateboarding. What happened at the skate park isn't fair. When a girl runs into a boy, it's a big fucking deal, but when a boy runs into a boy, it doesn't even matter. And I want you to keep skateboarding! And I also have... these. We have to go through here. Oh, yeah! ‐ Those aren't CDs. ‐ They are. ‐ Those are DVDs. ‐ No, they're CDs. ‐ Those? No, they're not. ‐ No, but they're C‐‐ it's still, like, on a CD. It's the same‐‐ ‐ Those are movies. ‐ The round, circular, like, shiny thing, right? That's a CD. ‐ They're discs. ‐ They're CDs, but... Hey, you have a pretty good selection. "Rescue Dawn"... ‐ Thank you. Thank you so much. ‐ "Memento"? ‐ Yeah. Have you ever seen that? ‐ Yeah, I saw it in school. ‐ In school? Really? ‐ Yeah. I was confused. Wait, you have "Camp Rock"? Why do you have "Camp Rock"? That's like the‐‐ that's, like, a Disney Channel movie from 2007. ‐ It's good. ‐ I mean, I thought so, too, when I was, like, seven. Interesting. Whoa. Oh, you have "The Jerk"? ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ You're a jerk. Oh, my God. ‐ Wait, what's this? What is this? "Get Off My Dick"? ‐ Oh, man. Yeah, that's the first video I ever made. I had no idea what I was doing. ‐ All right, well, let's watch it. ‐ No! ‐ Why not? Come on. ‐ We're not gonna watch my video. ‐ Come on! ‐ No, no, no, no, no, no! No. What can we watch? Oh, I know! ‐ "Camp Rock"? ‐ You ever seen "Downtown '81"? ‐ No. ‐ You know, maybe you and I should shoot some clips one of these days. ‐ Yeah! No, I'm totally down. Yo, I was actually thinking the other day about going to Columbus Park and‐‐ ‐ Oh, shh, shh, you gotta see this part. ‐ Oh. ‐ Can come true. Sometime, it might happen to you. Basquiat. ‐ Especially when you're young in New York. But once upon a time, this place was a wild frontier, and every youngster who was fast on the draw showed up on these streets to try his hand. Anyway, the story you are about to see isn't true, but it isn't false, either. Any resemblance between the characters and events depicted here and reality is purely magical. ‐ I awoke. Had I been dreaming? I think so. I tried to remember, but it slipped away. But I remembered this place. Here I was again. ‐ This is our Winter Bowl. ‐ Yeah, except it's summer. It's Summer's Eve Bowl. ‐ What? I don't get it. ‐ Summer's Eve Bowl? ‐ So? ‐ Summer's Eve is a douche. ‐ Guys, I have something to confess. ‐ What? You farted? ‐ No, I did. ‐ Oh. ‐ No. I like the girl. ‐ Wow. I fucking knew it, bro. ‐ Tch. But don't embarrass me like that again. ‐ Okay, I won't, but I fucking knew it. I knew it. I knew. I knew. ‐ I was just reading this article, and apparently, they just figured out the formula for... how fast the universe is expanding. ‐ How fast is it? ‐ I don't know. ‐ Oh, shit. Look. Shh. She asleep. Yo, how long do they need to take to kick in? I don't know because I don't understand time right now. ‐ Where'd you find the rat? ‐ He found me. I'm on this date right now with this girl, Ash. And, uh, I'm trying not to screw it up. Wow, look at you. In the video already. 'Cause cute girls get more views, don't you know that? ‐ Where'd I leave my pens? ‐ I'm starting to suspect you don't think this situation is serious. I need more time. You've got 48 hours. What's going on with you and Ash? You know, things just happened. This girl Yvette has been talking shit. We're about to mob, yo, we need to go. ‐Yo! ‐Are you following me?
