 [explosions] [Bullets ricocheting] ¶[Music playing] [Etta clapping] Good, huh? Exciting, realistic. Extremely. Well, that's exactly how we're gonna treat this new movie: Maximum realism, top-drawer production value. Oh, it'll be a smash, Mr. bremer. Thank you. And all the box-office receipts go to buy war bonds. (Bremer) So, general? Major? What do you say? Well, I have to admit, I had my doubts when you first suggested this project, Mr. bremer, but you've won me over completely. And me. Me, too. Just think, Hollywood. Then it's a go. As far as the war department is concerned, Mr. bremer, yes, it's a go. All right. A movie like you're going to make will be an enormous morale booster. 4 top American heroes recreating their acts of bravery on the screen. Yeah, you know, uh, we're still hoping, major, that your personal story is gonna be, uh, part of the movie. That's up to the general. Oh, but he's got to be in the movie, general. Steve bringing that flaming plane in and saving his crew. That'll really be something to see. You're absolutely right, yeoman prince. How soon do you need the major in Hollywood, Mr. bremer? Well, as soon as possible. Can you leave tomorrow? Uh, well-- he sure can. [Chuckles] Can you be ready to go, Diana? [Gasps] But do you need me in Hollywood? Well, I like that. Every beautiful young woman in these United States would give her right arm to go to Hollywood. And you ask if you're needed there. Well, I guess I just don't understand what's so special about Hollywood. It's just a small suburb in Los Angeles, isn't it? Oh, Diana, sometimes I don't understand you. Why? Hollywood, Clark gable, Cary grant, Tyrone power. Paradise, U.S.A. Paradise? Absolutely. Well, in that case, how can I refuse? I mean, I feel in need of a trip to paradise about now. And the festival will run a full 3 days. Now we'll need a queen of the festival, bearing in mind, of course, that I cannot fulfill that function under our constitution. Well, it should be Diana, of course. Oh, daughter, I only wish it could be so. It would be fitting. But, mother, this is the 2,000th anniversary of our arrival on paradise island. It's the bimillenial celebration of the most important day in our history. Diana is heir to the throne. Diana has to be here. I agree with you. She should be here. Well, then I guess someone will just have to go to America and bring her home for the festival. Did you have anyone special in mind for that assignment? Um, no, no, not really, except that it should be someone who has been to America already, and someone who is very close to Diana. Now where could I find such a person? Mother. [Chuckling] Very well, drusilla. You go fetch your sister. Thank you, mother. Drusilla, remember she said she was staying in a place called Hollywood. Ok. Drusilla, just give her the message and then come right back home. I don't want both my daughters in America in such perilous times. [Gasping] Drusilla, it just occurred to me, the last time you were in America-- I'll tell Diana, and thanks, mom. Oh, dear, I do hope I'm not making a mistake. Mom? [Clanging] [People chattering] (Man) Now take the camera and bring it back. Good morning. Oh, good morning, Mr. bremer. This is really fantastic. Yeah, terrific, isn't it? It's the first day of production, we're an hour behind schedule. Excuse me. Excuse me. All right, come on. Let's get moving. Let's get this show on the road. All right, what are we waiting for? Let's get going. Ok, then, uh, roll it. All right. Now give me the special effects. All right, now. Start the wind. Come on, more wind. Give me a bigger wind. All right. That's good. [Wind whooshing] Now, then. Ready? Action. Hit the silk, bill. That's an order, lieutenant. I'm taking her in alone. [Creaking] Cut it! Cut it! What's going on with the key light? Come on, fellas. (Mark) Yeoman prince, would you kindly not lean against the light? All right, once more. Just stay where you are, Steve, we got to do it again. Uh, sweat him up, will you, please? Yeah. [Girls screaming] [All clamoring] Thank you, miss montez. Man, oh, man. I got it. You got what? Her autograph. Who's she? Who's she? She's a star! Oh, go on, I know where the stars exist. They're in the heavens. You're weird. I'm weird? Sure you are. Like, what kind of a getup is that? Getup? The clothes, dummy, the clothes. Oh. Unless... Hey, you're in pictures, huh? Oh, yeah, lots of them. My mother has a book, and there's-- I knew it! I knew it. You were trying to put me on. Can I have your autograph? You there, miss. They'll be waiting for you. They will? Certainly. You're in  the fall of the Greek empire, right? Right. The fall of  the Greek empire? Now, come along through this door. Go through Western street... Well, I'm certainly looking forward to working with you. Thank you, sir. Yes. Welcome aboard. (Mark) Diana. This is cpl. Jim ames. Jim, this is, uh, yeoman Diana prince. Nice to meet you. Oh, I've heard about you. You're one of the war heroes that's gonna be in Mr. bremer's film, right? Yes, ma'am. Jim is another future star of mine. Maury, come here. Here you are. Your very own chair. That's terrific. Go on, sit down. Enjoy yourself. Uh, Mr. bremer, yes? I--I still don't know if I'm gonna be able to act in front of the camera. Sure you will. Just be yourself. See you later. Hey, Michael! Uh, Jim, come on and sit down, relax. [Sighs] Boy, I sure hope he knows what he's talking about. I'm sure he does. I've never been so scared in all my life. You'll be fine. Oh, Diana. Can you come here a minute, please? Sure. Excuse me. You'll be great. I promise. Yes, sir. Look, I'm, uh, kind of stuck up here in the sky. Can you get us a couple of cups of coffee, black, please? Sure. I think there's some just out back of the stage. It'll take a few minutes. Thank you. Ok. (Diana) Cpl. Ames! Hello again, Diana. Diana! Oh! [Both giggling] Dru! Ah! [Tires screeching] [Grunting] [Gasping] You stay here. I'll handle this. Drusilla, look out! [Tires screeching] [Gasps] You're all right. [Groans] [Sighs] Uh, I'll be right back. (Diana) Are you all right? What happened? I think that someone was trying to kidnap you. I thought that... Wonder woman. Boy, do I feel woozy. Here, let me help you up. [Sighs] Oh, excuse me. Uh, cpl. Ames, this is my little sister, drusilla. Drusilla, Jim ames. Hello. Too many things are all happening at once. Yeah. Do you have any idea who those men were or-- or what they wanted? Not the foggiest. [Sighs] I think I'd better go sit down. I'm not feeling too well. I can understand. Are you all right? Oh, yeah. Drusilla, what are you doing here? You know, the bimillenial celebration. Mother sent me to make sure that you'll come. Yes, of course. I haven't forgotten. You can tell mother that I'm gonna make every effort possible to be there. That won't satisfy her. You know mother. Diana, you have to be there. I'll try, drusilla, I'll really try. It's just that I'm very concerned. There are strange things going on here. Oh, you mean the attack on that nice Jim ames? Yes. You like him? Yeah, he's, uh, he's cute. Cute? You're back here in America for a few hours and you're already using their slang. Well, he is cute. Yes, he is. Anyway, is that what you're worried about? Oh, no, I'm concerned that someone might be trying to sabotage this film project. Who? I have no idea. A rival studio, maybe. I've heard a lot of things about Hollywood. People call it a jungle. Oh, all I saw was half a dozen sad-looking palm trees, hardly a jungle. Dru, it's not that kind of jungle. It's a jungle where businessmen prey on each other. Tsk, never will understand men. Well, me, neither. But I'm certainly learning more each day. Me, too. But the lesson's over for now. You have to return home to paradise island. I just got here. I know. I'm sure mother told you to deliver me the message and return home immediately, didn't she? Can't I just stay for the night? Mom won't mind, really. Well... [Chuckles] I've really missed you, and there is a party tonight. It'd be fun going together, don't you think? It's what they call a Hollywood party. But tomorrow you leave. Understood? Yeah. What do American women wear to these Hollywood parties? Steve told me to wear something slinky. Slinky. What's "slinky"? [Chuckles] I didn't tell him, but I haven't the slightest idea. Excuse me. ¶[Music playing] That's slinky? Uh, I think so. I don't think that would suit you. You don't? I don't know about that. I think it's cute. Oh, besides, look, Diana, everyone's staring at her, even the men. Oh, I'm glad you boys finally got here. What have you been doing? Looking for movie stars? [All laughing] You came to the right place. Well, here we are. My 4 hero stars together. You all know each other, I suppose. Hello, major. Hello, sergeant. I don't think you know my little sister, drusilla. This is, uh, sgt. Harry Willard. This is mark bremer, the producer. And lt. Bill rand. How do you do? They're all doing the movie together. (Mark) How are you, drusilla? Welcome. Look, I got to, uh, leave you nice people. There are more greats arriving. We're expecting Louis b. And j.L. A little later. Explain them to her, will you? Have fun. It's all right. I don't know who they are, either. This is really something. [Sighing] Sure is. Just like one of those fan mags, right, major? [Chuckling] Right, sergeant. What do you think of all this, Jim? Oh, I, uh, sort of feel out of place. Oh, no. You shouldn't. You're a war hero. Heck, I didn't do anything. You certainly did, soldier. Be proud of it. Hello, everyone. Super party. Has anyone taken care of the Navy? Not until now. Oh, good. Come on then. You can buy me a drink. [Laughs] Hey, sergeant, hmm? You're going to let the Navy get one up on you? No, sir. [Laughs] May I get you a drink? Oh, uh, sure, but nothing alcoholic. Oh, just a little glass of champagne. It'll relax you. No, thank you. I'll take one. No, you won't. You're too young. We'll find something suitable. Come on. You too, Jim. I want you where I can keep an eye on you. At least until we discover what that attack was about today. Oh, yes, sir. Oh, no, thanks. I think it's absolutely marvelous what you did. I mean, so brave. Not really. To tell the truth, I--I just acted out of instinct. But with all your men injured like that you kept firing, and you sunk a Nazi battleship. Just a destroyer. Destroyer, battleship, it's all the same. You sunk it. Did the president, uh, give you that medal personally? [Laughs] In the flesh. Tell me about it. Well, I was called up to the white house, and the president-- no, uh, not here, there are too many people. Let's go somewhere else where we can be alone. [Chuckles] So, what did he say to you? Uh, first they read the citation. All very official. A lot of whereases and wherefores. Then they, uh, handed the medal to the president, and the president presented it to me. He shook my hand. Said that America was proud to have officers like me-- sailor. Don't make a sound. You're coming with us. Where are you taking me? Get in the truck. All right, let's get out of here. Bye-bye. (Steve) Mr. bremer. Yeah? Have you seen lt. Rand? No, not recently. Why? We're getting ready to leave. I wanted to say good night. Oh, listen, major, last time I saw him, he was getting pretty thick with some little starlet. Maybe they slipped off early, you know? Yeah. And what was her name? Well, I don't know. You know, they all look the same to me. Why, you're not worried, are you? Uneasy maybe. Well, don't worry. He'll turn up at the studio tomorrow. He'd better, he's on early call. Maybe you're right. Excuse me. Well, did you find lt. Rand? No, he left early. Well, that's strange. Why would he leave a nice party like this early? Well, maybe he had something important on his mind. I think he did. Shall we? I hope he's all right. Mr. bremer, thank you very much. It was a lovely party. Oh, you're welcome. Glad you could all come. Nice to meet you. You, too. See you tomorrow. All right, kid. Thanks for the party. Yeah, you're welcome. Listen, I'm sorry you didn't get to meet Louis b. Or j.L. I didn't know they came. They didn't. Good night. Good night. Gloria! (Gloria) Is everyone gone? Yes, everyone's gone. You can come out. I assume that everything went all right. Perfectly. That's very good, my dear, well done. To your health. Good night. Uh, thanks, Paula. That's all for now. You can finish it up in the morning. Mark, where's the blonde? She's gone. What did you tell her? I did not have to tell her anything, Kurt. I promised her a part in a picture. Is everything all right at your end? Perfect. Well, that will be a change from this morning's fiasco with cpl. Ames. How were we supposed to know wonder woman was in Hollywood? We're gonna have to be a lot more careful next time. Don't worry, I have other plans for young Mr. ames. Now what about the other two? Maj. Trevor, and, uh, sgt. Willard? In 3 days, the 4 of them will be on their way to Germany. 4 American war heroes to stand trial in Berlin for war crimes against the German people. That, Kurt, is a great propaganda victory. The party should be proud of you. Well, they should. Getting them all together, the 4 of them. With all of this publicity, and kidnapping them in front of everybody's noses. And then-- and then? And then, Kurt, when the war is over, and we've won, then I will control the entire American film industry. Well, we've checked everywhere. Bill rand has disappeared. What about the girl he left the party with? Well, we don't know he did that for sure. She's our only lead. I'd like to see a list of your party guests. I'll tell my secretary. Excuse me. Listen, how long is it gonna take us to wrap up here and set up for the sgt. Willard sequence? About a half an hour. All right, do it. We've wasted enough time here already. Ok, we're moving outside. All you sailor extras, you have to become Nazi soldiers. Well, what do you think? Oh, I don't know what to think. First that attack on Jim ames, then bill rand disappearing. One thing I do know, I'm gonna keep a pretty close eye on Harry Willard and young Jim from now on. Jim's with dru. They went somewhere to have a farewell soda. She's leaving? I'm afraid so. She has to, uh, go home to mother. You know, at least she did have to go home. Maybe it's better if she sticks around for a while. She can help us watch out for Jim. What good would a 15-year-old girl be if there was any trouble? Maybe none. But one thing's for sure. She'll know where he is all the time. [Slurps] I really like ice-cream sodas. Could I have another one? You've had 3 already. I want the, uh-- I want the victory special. Hi, sweetie. [Making kissing noises] Jim, Jim, the victory special? But that's double size. I know. Oh, boy, you have some appetite for a girl. Please? Ok, I'll get it. Thanks. Oh, and I'll be back in a minute, ok? Ok. What's your name? [Chuckling] [Sighs] Yes. Yeoman Diana prince. She's with maj. Trevor on the mark bremer movie. I think they're still on stage 25. [Clears throat] Look at the soldier boy, will you? A victory special. Well, ain't he cute? Hey, where did you get the pretty suit, soldier boy? Oh, Freddy, you're dumb. Don't you know? Uncle Sam gave him that suit. He gives them to all his little soldier boys. Is that right? No wonder we ain't in the army. Wouldn't be seen dead in a suit like that. Hi, Diana. Drusilla. Where are you? Oh, I'm at this real neat coffee shop. I'm just going to have one more victory special. I promise I'll leave as soon as I'm finished. You don't have to leave. I don't? No, I'll explain later. But, uh, just keep an eye on Jim. Oh, you're afraid something might happen to him. Dru, sometimes you're so perceptive, you remind me of mom. I'll see you at the studio later. (Diana)  Bye-bye. That's a cute little number you're with there, soldier boy. You want to introduce us, huh? Soldier boy, my friend just asked you a question. (Jim) I'm sorry, we're busy. Hey, Georgie, the soldier boy's busy. You don't want to tell us her name? Tell Freddy her name. (Freddy) Come on, tell Freddy. You can tell Freddy. You don't like it, just tell her name. At ease, soldier. Excuse me. Hey, look at the chick in the funny suit. Where's the costume party, cutie? I think you should leave him alone. He's a war hero. Hang around. After we take care of him, we'll, uh, take care of you. I'm warning you. I'm quaking in my boots. Excuse me. Hi. Oh, what-- what happened in there? There was a fight. Didn't you see? No, I was in the powder room. You didn't see anything? Well, yes, I saw 2 men laying on the floor. Well, they started picking on me. I took care of them. You-- oh. Come on, we'd better get back to the studio. (Director) All right, come on, a lot more dirt. A lot more. This is a war film, for crying out loud. Come on, really get him dirty. All right. That's enough dirt. Now-- now sweat him up good. Lots of sweat. All right. Fine, fine. All right, now, where are my dead bodies? Fellows, will you please stay close when we're trying to do this? It's very difficult. Take your places, please. Take your guns. Take your places. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let's have it very quiet now, fellows. Oh, Nazis, get ready. All right, all right. Are you ready? Fine. Now ready on the smoke and the flames. Diana, I need to talk to you. Is it important? I think it may be. Ok. Just as soon as he finishes with this shot. Action! [Birds chirping] [Bullets ricocheting] [Guns firing] [Machine gun firing] Oh, cut! Cut! Look what happened to the grenade. It didn't go off. All right. We'll have to do it again. Sgt. Willard. Sgt. Willard, come on back. We have to do it again. Sgt. Willard? Sgt. Willard, can you hear me? Sgt. Willard? Willard? Willard? Where is he? Where's Willard? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? He's disappeared. Well, keep looking. Willard is still among the missing. How am I supposed to make a movie when all my stars are disappearing one by one? Did you have all the studio gates checked? (Mark) Yeah, sure, but there's too much traffic passing in and out. Can't pin anything down. I mean, he could have been taken out in a prop van, or a laundry truck, anything. Whoever did it was obviously waiting behind that headquarter set and had to be acquainted with the workings of a movie studio. Major, there are 5,000 people on the payroll here. And they are all acquainted with the workings of a movie set. [Phone ringing] I get the phone. Bremer. No, there's no more shooting today. It's a wrap. Diana. Excuse me for one second, Steve. Yes, dru. I wanted to talk to you about Jim. Ok. I don't think he's very much of a war hero at all. What do you mean? He's not very heroic. He lied to me. Well, sometimes that has something to do with a thing called ego. What did he lie about? (Steve) Excuse me, Diana. Yes, sir. I'm sorry to interrupt, drusilla, but Diana and I have work to do. Yes, sir, right away. Uh, dru, find out everything you can about what we were discussing. We'll talk later, ok? Sure. Yeah. Right, right. [Sighs] Maj. Trevor wants me to stick close by. He thinks maybe I could be the next one. Oh. Well, I'll stay with you if you like. Yeah, I'd like that. Do you think he'd mind if we went for a walk or something? I don't think he'd mind, if we stay inside the studio. So, come on. Diana, get a hold of the local military-intelligence officer and have them run a check on that list of party guests. We must find that girl. Yes, sir. Try and find a list of all the people who knew anything about today's shooting schedule as far as it affected sgt. Willard. And make sure none of this leaks out to the press. (Diana) Absolutely not, sir. In one way or the other, we've got to find out where those 2 men are being held. Ah, there you are, gentlemen. You are comfortable, I trust. Where are we? You are on the d-704 somewhere in pacific. We'll remain on station here until your 2 companions are prevailed upon to join us. Then we'll proceed around cape horn and set course for bremen. If you think you'll get your hands on Steve Trevor, you're mistaken. I guarantee you 24 hours from now, cpl. Ames and maj. Trevor will be aboard. Take them away. Any problems, Kurt? Worked like a dream. He came through that door expecting to find 2 actors dressed as Nazi officers, instead he found us. Very good. All right. Now, maj. Trevor is creating pressures for us. He has called the local office of military intelligence, and next will be the f.B.I. So we're going to have to move quicker than we'd planned. What do you want to do? I want to take them both at the same time, maj. Trevor and cpl. Ames. You'll wait for instructions. That's all. [Door closes] [Sighs] I really like hot dogs. They're even better than ice cream. Could I have some more mustard? [People chattering] I like you, dru. I like you a lot. That's why I'm gonna tell you what I am. What I did. What I got my medal for. There was a mistake. [Chuckles] How can that be? Well, I'll tell you how. The citation reads that I captured a dozen Nazis single-handed. The truth is I got cut off from my unit. I was all alone. And I saw a group of Nazis and I thought I'd give myself up. Spend the rest of the war in a nice, safe prison camp. What I didn't know was that they were as afraid as I was. As soon as I appeared they all threw their guns down. Seemed like they had the same--same idea. [Sighs] I had to take them in. I couldn't do nothing else. Oh. Another thing. That fight here this morning. It wasn't me who took on those 2 fellows. [Sighs] I think I was as scared then as I was with the Nazis. I guess I'm just scared all the time. Oh, no. I think you're really brave for telling me all of that. (Man over p.A. System)  Telephone for cpl. Ames. Excuse me. Thank you. Cpl. Ames. Yes. Jim, anything wrong? No. Look, I got to go back to my hotel. I'll see you later. Ok. It doesn't usually go this slow. We should have been shooting a half an hour ago. I don't know what's the matter. What's holding us up? Our star, cpl. Ames, hasn't arrived yet. Where is he? I don't know, Mr. bremer. He said he was going to pick up maj. Trevor. They should be here by now. Terrific. (Steve) Sure you have the right directions? (Jim) This is where they told me, major. Wait a minute, I'll ask these guys up here. Hey, you guys. You seen a movie company around here? Movie company? Uh, well, uh, let's see now. I think that there might be... All right. Both of you. Get out of the car. Into the other car. Put it down, major. [Birds chirping] I'm sorry. Well, we can't do anything without them. Move them back. All right. It's a wrap for today. Everybody back to the studio. They, uh, found the car. It's been abandoned. Steve? And Jim? Both disappeared. No sign of either of them. Disappeared? Well, what are you going to do about it? Now, don't worry. We're alerting the authorities now. Thank you very much, Mr. bremer. Come on, dru. [Whispering] I have an idea. Well, soldier. How did they get to you? I'm sorry, major. We'll see about that once we get out of here. [Door opens] There they are, Mr. bremer. Thank you, captain. Gentlemen, welcome aboard. Major. [Snickers] Not a bad production, bremer. You set it all up very smoothly. Got the whole project going, gathered your 4 victims together, you knew our every movement. Ja. Unfortunately, now that you know, there's very little you can do about it. Tomorrow you'll be on your way to Germany. In the meantime, major, please do not try to escape. All you will achieve is an early death. Gentlemen, have a pleasant journey. Mr. bremer. Yeah? Are my parents all right? You promised me. They're all right. When will I get to see them? They are on board. You may see them tonight before you leave for Germany. And then you'll turn them loose? If everything goes according to plan. I'm going to see them now. I will tell them of your concern. Prepare to get underway. (Captain)  All engines  ahead one quarter. Your course: 163 degrees. Hello. Nothing today. Come back tomorrow. Oh, no, you don't understand. You see, um, I'm looking for an actress. Well, you came to the right place. Ok. She's 5'2". She's got blonde hair, blue eyes, and, uh, slinky. Slinky? Yeah, you know. Uh, she's slinky. What's her name? That's the problem. I don't know her name. That's why I'm here. Hundreds of girls come through here every day. Well, all those girls, they do have pictures, right? Sure, but as I just said, there are hundreds of them. Well, you see, this is very important. I really have to find that girl. All right, come on in. Thank you very much. [Both laughing] Well, that's not the end. Here you are. Any problems? None. Your son sends his best wishes. Kurt, the prisoners will be transferred to a truck and then taken to a point on the coast where a u-boat can pick them up. Well, what about the kid's parents? You're not really gonna let them go, are you? What do you think? And that, uh, blonde, Gloria? We'll take care of her, too. That's her. Here she is. Gloria Beverly. You're right, she is slinky. Where can I get in touch with her? Right here on the lot. She's just been recommended for a term contract by Mr. mark bremer personally. He said he didn't know her. They all say that, dear. [Birds chirping] [Knocking at door] Come in. Gloria Beverly? That's me. What movie are you doing, honey? Oh, I'm not in any movie. [Chuckling] Oh, you mean you wear that for real? Yes, I do. And in a moment you're going to find out why. I'm going to ask you some questions. And you're going to answer me. What are you doing? Are you some kind of nut? You're going to answer me with the truth. It was Mr. bremer who arranged sgt. Willard's kidnapping, wasn't it? Yes. Now maj. Trevor and Jim ames are missing, too. Has he taken them? Yes. Where? I--I don't know. Does Mr. bremer have a private yacht, an airplane, anything like that? No. A private place where no one else goes. The only private place he wanted to show me was his bedroom. Whatever he's involved in, it's at the studio, or his estate. There's got to be someplace else. Now, think. There is this one place. Where? He has a hold on stage 12 right here on the lot. Oh, it's so realistic. It certainly is. But it looks like we're too late. They probably faked this to make sure that none of them tried to escape until all 4 were captured. Well, where have they taken them to? An airfield, a dock, who knows? How are we going to find them? Wait a minute. Gloria Beverly said that it was either the studio or his estate. And they're not here. ¶ Wonder woman ¶ as soon as the other truck arrives, put them aboard. Well, why not take this one, save, uh, making the transfer? This is a studio truck. If it's not returned, it will be missed. See? All right, major. Inside. [Birds chirping] Mom, dad. [Grunts] Ok, here they come. Let's get them out of here. [Yells] Wonder woman! Now, stay right there. Do not move. [Groans] She's been hit. Bremer, now stay where you are, you understand me? I understand you, bremer, and I don't care any more. Jim, don't! [Bullet ricocheting] [Grunts] All right, hold it, bremer. On your feet. Nice work, soldier. That's exactly what one would expect from a brave man. Thanks, major. And thank those 2 women. Come on. Well, you're not hurt. No. So why did you-- after what you told me about Jim, I wanted to give him a chance to prove himself. And he did, didn't he? Yes, he certainly did. Lieutenant, sergeant, put them in the truck. Come on. Boy, major, I wish I could meet wonder girl again, under different circumstances. And wonder woman. [Diana cheering] Steve, you were wonderful. Thank you. Very moving. You know, etta, this picture will give a big boost to the morale of all our armed forces. It will boost the morale of our allies, too, sir. It really is a great movie. I'm glad I was able to see it before going home on leave. So am I. How long will you be gone? Oh, 3 or 4 days. Um, a celebration at home. A birthday? No. An anniversary. Well, at least we can all have dinner together before we go our separate ways. Hot dogs and ice cream? Whatever you want. You know, general, there's one thing I regret. That wonder woman and wonder girl weren't in the picture. They're the real stars. Superstars. Did I ever tell you of the time wonder woman-- 4 times, major. All right. Come on, you two. You want to hear about the exploits of wonder woman, don't you? I certainly don't. Why not? You might grow up to be just like her someday.
