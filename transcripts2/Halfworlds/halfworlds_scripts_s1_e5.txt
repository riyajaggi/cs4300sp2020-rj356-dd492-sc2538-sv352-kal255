 We're closed. What are you doing? Helping you to close up. You etched a tattoo on a man's back a few days ago. I do so many. No. This one was different. A symbol. An ancient symbol. You sure you got the right place? Maybe it wasn't you. But I bet you know where it came from, don't you?

 Coki got into a fight. Sarah: It's a big fucking mess. There are people coming in. Could you-- Pi? You better go. Relax. I just want to chat. Pinung: I know who you are. I saw your Palasik tattoo! Get the fuck out of there now. What's going on here? Pi? Get back. Tell me what you know, or-- Motherfucker.

 Marni: Hey, little fucker! You're a tricky little bitch, aren't you? Tell me what I need to know or I'll fuck you up. Tell me! Hide. Half-breed! Barata: Once upon a time, there was an evil creature. She was beautiful and charming. Barata: And a naive man fell in love with her... without any idea of who she really was. And little did he know... she was going to destroy everyone... he ever loved. What happened to her? Fuck. Pinung. Pi! Pi! What the fuck happened to her? Palasik poison. Fuck. She'll recover. It's almost time. What? The Gift is your destiny. What does that even mean? Get out! Pi! Pi. Gorga: Does she know about Sarah? I have no idea. I do. The coveted Gift. The blessing from the gods. You mean the curse. Well, I'm curious... to see what you've got... up your sleeve. I'm going to stop the Gift from happening. You know very well in order for you to do that, you're going to have to kill all of us. Then the girl. And yourself. Or maybe... I just kill one. Oh! You mean the priest. How are you going to get rid of him? He's too powerful for you. Someone out there knows how to. Yeah. But that someone is gone. Then I'll just have to find him. Juragan: There is nothing worse than an uncoordinated partnership. It can be counter productive. Rendering the partnership meaningless. Luckily... I have a minimum guarantee clause in all my partnership agreements. So unproductive partners... won't be something I have to think about in the future. Wait. I didn't mean to go against your wishes. But my instincts told me that something was up. And it turns out, I was right. What are you talking about? Well, clearly your attack dog hasn't been doing her job. 'Cause if she had, then surely she would have reported all this to you. And what makes you think she hasn't? 'Cause if she had... even you wouldn't be this calm. You think everything's going according to your little plan, and nothing can get in the way to distract you. For a politician, you're not a very keen observer, are you? The half-breed. Barata. He's alive, and he's in town. So... what are you going to do now? Cok? Coki. No. I'm fine. I'm fine. Nadia: Whoops. Excuse you. Excuse me, Mommy. That's all right, love. I like the sandwich you made. You do? They don't make sandwiches for you at the orphanage? Not as good as yours. They usually make nasi goreng, gado-gado, ikan sambal. Nadia: Well, you are very lucky because I'm going to cook for you now. Mommy? Mm-hmm? Can I ask you a question? Yes, of course. Why did you adopt me? Because... you were the best. And no one can sing "My Little Red Pony" like you do! "My Little Blue Pony." Oh. Blue. Sorry. And you're the prettiest. You are very pretty too, Mommy. Have a good time at school. Be careful. Mommy? Are you crying? It's okay, honey. Come here. Here. I'm here. I'm here. Hi. It's okay. It will be the last time, okay? What the hell happened? She was attacked. By who? A Palasik attacked her. What the fuck is that? A lot of shit has been going down lately. I don't even know how to begin explaining this to you. Only reason why Pinung knows is because she was there the night we got attacked. Pinung's done some research... about these creatures that look like us humans. The only thing is that they're... immortal. Coki: Please... tell me this has nothing to do with that guy you keep drawing. Maybe. Jesus. And now Pinung's been hurt... by this thing. Sarah: He said she can recover. He said? He said. This is all your fault. I hope you know that. All right? None of this would have happened if it weren't for you. We wouldn't be knee-deep in your shit. Why are you saying these things? I think you should go. No. I want to be here when she wakes up. Yeah, well, maybe she doesn't want to see you when she wakes up. She will want to see me. Well, maybe I don't want to see you. All right? Maybe I am done with your shit. Maybe I'm done following you as you lie to me again and again and hurt the people you love. I'm not leaving. Just leave us alone, Sarah. That's the least you could do. Fine. I'll go. Ros: We only have four days left. Still a lot to do. Kill the half-breed, look for the symbols. Multi-tasking. Tony: That's very modern of you. But only the leader of the elders knows where all the symbols are. Maybe he has all three of them. He only has one. So, where can we find the rest of the symbols? Ah. Nice. Nice! Where the fuck is that nail? Smart. Fuck you. That's for swearing. I see you've moved the toilets. Tell us where the symbols of the Demit Gods are. Or you will be living in darkness forever. Hassan. We know your weakness. No. Wait. Want a puff? No. Don't ever. All right. I'll tell you where the parchments are. Let her go. Coki: This is all your fault. I hope you know that. Barata: You may be the one chosen to receive the Gift. Coki: None of this... Barata: A bestowing of a great and terrible power. The Gift is your destiny. Gusti: She looked like a woman, but she was a beast. Dressed in this black cloak. Coki: Your shit. Gusti: I saw her kill your parents. Kill your parents. First the lovers... then the Chosen One. You came because the end is near. And once again, you're destined to bring on the apocalypse. I want to know how to defeat Juragan. And I want to live the rest of my life on my terms. I just want to be with someone I love. You've helped me before. Help me again. I need to kill Juragan. Without him there will be no ceremony. Hopefully there will be no Gift. What is this? You'll know when the time comes. Now can you please leave me in peace? Mommy? Hey! Is that you? Yes. What are you doing down here? Uncle is preparing dinner for us. Uncle who? How can you forget... about this uncle, Nadia? Is it because... you haven't seen him for such a long time? Nadia: Tari... can you please go to your room? What's wrong, Mommy? Nothing's wrong. I just need to talk to Uncle before dinner. You are making Mama upset! No, I'm not. How could you say that? I can hear it in her voice! She's not upset. She's just... worried. Tari: Worried about what? Worried that if you're not being a good girl, then somebody might have to take you away. Nadia: Tari, sayang. I'm okay. Just please go to your room. Now? Very smart kid. Where did you find her? Oh. Do tell the name of the orphanage. I might want to get one for myself. And... why pick a blind one? So she won't see that you don't age? Now... that's a little selfish, don't you think? Especially making a gabal kid your child. She'll grow old... and you won't. Then she'll be as old as you. And she'll be like your mother. Then your grandmother. Then she will die. What about your real daughter? She thinks about you all the time. What about the years my family has spent taking care of her? You know, we've been sending you proof for centuries that she's alive and well. Don't you... want to hold her in your arms again? Or... maybe you've just decided to find a replacement? I hate it when I have to discipline my own people. Especially one who's been with us for such a long time. The half-breed. He's in town. Get rid of him. Or next time... you will be picking those... from your child.
