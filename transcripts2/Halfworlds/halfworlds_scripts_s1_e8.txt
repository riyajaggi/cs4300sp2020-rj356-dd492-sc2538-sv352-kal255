 Nadia: The Gift was complete. As darkness fell... the world of Demit and man was cut in half. The survivors were helpless. Going from protector to enslaved. Until one day, a very special girl was born. And a mother knew the pain... of losing her child. Are you two going to join the party? Tony: What about the half-breed?

 Don't worry. I have the half-breed. But I don't think he will be joining us for a drink. Tony: That's cause for celebration, then. I'll bring his body with me. He should be buried there. Whatever he has done, he deserves respect. Tony: Just give us what you promised. Yes, I can assure you of that. But I need you to take care of one last thing. It's not for me. It's for you. You need to take care of him. After the twosome takes out Gorga, or the other way around...

 you take care of who's left. Then, the Gift is yours. Marni: We both know that that's not true. None of us will receive the Gift, will we? Sarah's the chosen one. You've prepped her from a very young age. But you didn't tell Nadia to kill both her parents, did you? 'Cause you knew that you'd need leverage. That when the time comes and she turns, she'll do exactly what you want. You're planning to carry on the work of your ancestors, aren't you? And kill every single Demit through her. So with much time to think, I've decided, I only really want one small thing from you. And that is? An understanding. A "Get out of Jail Free" card to use whenever I want. Pi. Pinung: Huh? Does that work? Yeah, of course. Is there a recording? All right, going back to last night. Hmm... I can't see his face. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Back up, back up. There! Pinung: That's the plate number. Check which asshole owns that car. Nice! Coki: W, E... Why does his name sound so familiar? It's in North Jakarta! Sarah's got to be there! Let's go! What have you been up to? You told me you were going to tell me about my mother. I'm not just going to tell you about your mother. I'm going to bring her to you. Tell me where she is now! You haven't seen her for 17 years. You're telling me you can't wait for just a few more hours. After tonight, you'll find out... who you really are. Sarah: Hey! Who do you think he is? I don't know. Do you think he's one of them? I really don't care. Coki: I just want to get to Sarah. This is it. I don't have a good feeling about this. This is his office. Sarah? Look, Pi, there's no one here. Let's go. Pinung: Can you hear that? Pi, let's go! We got to find Sarah. It's like a faint whirring noise or something. Is it coming from behind the wall? It's getting louder. No way. Oh, what? Is she, like, in a dungeon? Hey. Tony: Priest! Juragan: Don't you two look lovely. Is that him? Yes! If you don't mind, I'd like to see for myself. Juragan: He was the last thing in your way. Is your boy coming with the last symbol or not? I am here. Juragan: Ah. Gorga: Well, then. Tony: I should have known. Let's dance. Coki: It's an entire underground tunnel system. Coki: Dead end. Pinung: Fuck. Seriously? Through here. Holy fuck. What is this place, Coki? Coki: I'm glad you're all right! Are you okay? He was never going to give the Gift to us. It's over, Tony. Let's get out of here. Coki: Sarah! Sarah, where are you going? Sarah, we got to go. What are you doing? Sarah: There's someone else in here. Hi. Come. Who is that? Sarah: Coki, please. This is my chance to see my mother again. Please don't take this away from me. It can't be. Juragan: How? Barata: I can save her. Gusti: Are you sure? Barata: His magic won't hurt me, but he has to think I'm dead. It's done. Where is she? Pinung: Okay. Let's go and we'll take her with us. I can't go. What? I can't. I'm staying. What are you talking about, Sarah? He promised he'll bring my mom to me. I don't have to bring her down here to receive the Gift. The Chosen One can be anywhere and receive it. Not if you don't conduct the ritual. Pi, what's happening? S-Sarah? Marni: What the fuck are you doing here? Making the right choice. We need to get her to a hospital. No. Hasan: Find her! You know where she is! Hasan: Go! Marni: That's the end of him. Pi, run! Coki. Pinung: Coki? Pinung: Coki. Coki: Sarah? Pinung: No! Pinung: Coki! What happened? Where's Pinung? She's at The Moth. How about Coki? He's dead. You killed him. But you didn't mean to. No. No. Well, we have to go back there then. We can't. It's too dangerous. Coki? Juragan: Once upon a time, there lived a very special girl... whom the gods gave a very special Gift. She could make her dreams come true, and bring the dead back to life. Because of her... those who were lost, found a new purpose. A mother and a child were reunited. A weary couple fell in love again. But she couldn't make all dreams come true. In the end, it doesn't really matter. No one gets to live happily ever after. Human. Demit. Half-breed. Because the Halfworld... is everywhere.
