 I need to interview your friend here. Alone. Can you tell me what just happened here, Sarah? I have no idea. So you're saying you just happened to be at two murder scenes in a week. Barata: There was a time when the Demit hunted... the beasts which hunted mankind. Demit became the protectors of mortals everywhere... and watched over humans in peace. But this peace would soon be broken, because the blessing which the gods promised...

 would turn out to be a curse. A curse which would change the lives of humans and Demit... forever. You know why I don't like liars? Because I would destroy them. Even though I prefer to help them. You believe that, don't you? That I'm here to help people? I know about your unfortunate childhood. That your parents were killed by the mob. Don't you dare bring up my parents. Sometimes... things are not what they seem.

 You know what? Don't fuck with me, okay? Sarah. Are you okay? Hey. Sarah: Let's go. Pinung: What just happened there, Sarah? I mean, first your friend was murdered, and then you start asking me about this Palasik shit. Then the next thing we know, that waiter goes slasher-film on us. Do you know what's going on? What just happened? I don't know. Asking me about this Demit shit. And all you know is-- Demons. Pinung! Sorry! Please stop! Coki: What is that? It's just a box of old stuff Pinung lets me keep here. Your folks made a cute couple. Yeah. They did. All right. What do you want? We want to help. Help with what? Information. We can't trust them. I know you, both of you. Going from one city to another city on a killing spree. Just how many humans have you slaughtered? Or have you lost count? Humans? Who cares? Yes, we have a huge appetite for humans, but we protect our own. Gorga: You have no values. No loyalty except to yourself. What information do you have? Why did you bring him here? He is supposed to be disposed of. The detective's people should have taken care of this. I thought I could... borrow him. He is one of us. If you want his death to mean something, do it now. Do what, exactly? Your thing. You know, your... Yeah. Just do it. The half-breed... Barata... is back. Tony: So, now you have two problems. First... you have no one to receive the Gift. Second... the half-breed, as long as he is alive... might steal the Gift from us. Two problems... one solution... us. Tony: Wait! I can assure you that there is absolutely nothing you can gain from fighting with each other. But I want you all to know that we respect you as elders. And if we need to get down on our knees to prove that, we will. Now... there are so many ways to prove that we are worthy of the Gift. How about this? We give you the half-breed's head, you give us your blessing. This is outrageous. Hold it! Nine days left for the Gift. You bring me the half-breed's head, and you shall receive our blessing. That's why they say you're the wisest. All right, cheers everyone. Bandi... That's the only choice. You call that a choice? We don't have an option. Barata: I didn't come back to have more Demit blood on my hands. Firad's death was... unfortunate. What are you going to do about her? Eddy told you about the girl? He did. Right before he was murdered by Juragan's attack dog. Once the others know you're back... they'll hunt you down. Once they know about the girl... you know that you might have to kill her, too, because we cannot allow the wrong person to receive the Gift. Again. No offense. None taken. Sarah: Who are you? Why do I keep drawing your face? Male voice: Why? Why? Why? Barata: Remember... Male voice: Why? Why? Barata: Look back... Find it... Your parents... The past... Open your eyes... Pinung: Where did you get this from again? Sarah: These kids gave them to me. The night Coki had his first gig in the Moth. It was weird, though. They were wearing hoodies, so I couldn't really see their faces. What? I was about to tell you about them the other night, but that psycho waiter cut us off. They could actually be Tuyul. They are known to steal for their human masters. So, listen to this. A long time ago, there were ancient gods who created creatures called Demit. And they were immortal. They were so strong, and they were our protectors. Then in the 1700s, there was a war and they turned on each other. Most of them were killed. The remaining survivors were scattered across the land. But since that time, they started to change. What kind of change? Palasik started to feed on unborn fetuses. Genderuwo, cursed with a hunger for flesh... Kuntilanak, driven by lust for blood... They mate. And then they terminate. Finally, the Banaspati, the most mysterious of them all. Sarah: Why? Pinung: Because we don't know if they're good or evil. Sarah: How do you get rid of them? Well, according to this book... the eyes are their weakness. You can blind them. But only one thing can kill them: a Demit blade. Sarah: Where can we get one? You can't. Those blades were from a volcano that's been extinct for hundreds of years. Sarah: Hey! Gusti: Sarah! It's... Were you chasing me? Why did you run? Because you tried to run me over! I was trying to catch up with you. So, you're following me? Get in the car. No. No, I don't think so. Sarah, this is not the friendliest part of town, even for you. Get in the car. You won't find whatever you're looking for in this part of town. You don't know what I'm looking for. I just don't think that you would understand. Try me. This might sound crazy... but I'm starting to believe that there are things out there that... really shouldn't exist in this world, but they do. You don't have to believe me. I believe you. Seventeen years ago, I just joined the force. It was my first assignment. It was chaos. I got separated from my team and I was trying to find my way back, then I saw her. Then... I saw... she looked like a woman but she was a beast, in this black cloak. I saw her kill your parents. What? I was so scared, I... She looked... inhuman. I thought she was gonna kill you, too, but somehow... she just left you there. Then somebody came... You actually pay to live here? No. The guy who guards this place, he lets me stay here. I know that's illegal. Don't worry, I won't tell the cops. I better get going. Oh... Woo hoo! Look at you. Where have you been all these years? Huh? How can you live with all the guilt? He hasn't been living, look at him. Can we kill you? At least if you let us do that, it will make up for all the shitty things you've done. All right, ladies' first. Thanks, darling. You okay? Yes. Tony: All right. It's my turn. Woo-haa! Oh! Mm. Tony: Be a good boy. All right. Oh! All right. All right... Ah, pretty good. All right. Ros: I'll count to ten. If you don't surrender, we'll kill them. One, two, three... Oops! One... two... I never liked swimming. Nah. He's dead. What the f-- No! What are you doing? No, stop! Stop! Oh, my God! Fuck! Just stop! Holy shit! Shit, shit, shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit! What happened? Oh, my God. Hey! Fuck. They're out there. And some of them might know what you are. No. Oh, shit! No, no, no, no, no! No! Hey! Hey! Wake up! Hey! Juragan: Hello, Detective. I hope you wiped your shoes before coming in. All that dirt... from the streets. Of course, sir. Sit. What have you got for me? The tattoos, sir. Of a Demit god? I know where they came from. Tell me. The girl... the artist... Sarah. I believe she's the key. Ouch. She is not to be touched. I'm sorry, sir? When word gets out... nobody touches her. Yes, sir. But how do I do that, sir? That, Detective, is your concern. Now... let me finish... my show.
