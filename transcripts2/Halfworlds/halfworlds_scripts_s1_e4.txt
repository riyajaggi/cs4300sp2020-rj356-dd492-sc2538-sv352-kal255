 Bartender: Hey. Coki: Hey, man. Just want to know if she's with you. No. Are you sure? Yeah. Bartender: Maybe a fan of yours. Coki: Haha. Funny. I'll go check it out. Yeah. Thank you, man. Hello. Are you okay? No.

 Look, miss, they're closing soon. Coki: Uh, look. These guys have been here since noon. All right? They gotta go back and rest. And I need my peace. Mas, mas, mas. It's okay. What are you doing? Sarah: You were bleeding out. And now you're almost healed. What the fuck are you? You better answer the damn question. Or this goes straight through your eye. See how fast it'll heal. It won't. So answer my questions!

 Sarah: Demits, are they real? Barata: Yes. Sarah: So you're one of them? Barata: Yes. Sarah: Why were you following me? What is this "Gift"? Barata: A bestowing of a great and terrible power. Sarah: What kind of power? Barata: It all depends on the person who receives it. Sarah: Where does it come from? Barata: The gods. Sarah: Sounds like a fairytale. Barata: We are a fairytale. Barata: Or a nightmare. Marni: The Demit believed in a curse. Marni: The curse of the half-breed. Born of two worlds. Human and Demit. They feared this half-breed would destroy them all. But a wise man stood in their way. And they cast the half-breed out into the mortal world. Marni: Little did they know... nothing can prevent the Gift of the gods. What's this? It's done. This is not acceptable. Tony: I stabbed him in the heart with my own blade. And usually when I do that to someone... they end up dead. You've got to learn how to trust your own kind. We trust you, because we need each other. You need me... because you know that I'm the only one who knows where the symbols are. We need to work together. Remember the last time? If the Gift falls into the half-breed's hands, it's the end for all of us. So shut the fuck up... and trust us. We trust you. The half-breed cannot be allowed to live. Bandi: Time's running out. Six days to go. Bring me his body. Ros: I can sense if someone doesn't like me. Mmm? Gorga: Well, darling... I haven't got a clue what you're talking about. I hope so. 'Cause if you do... it's gonna get ugly. You're back. Hey. Are you expecting somebody else? No. Is this a bad time? No, sorry. I was just getting ready for bed. It was a long day. Look, if you want me to go, I could just-- No, please stay. Are you okay? I got attacked at The Moth today. By who? Thugs again, or-- I see you're drawing his face again. What? His face! Sorry. I was just cleaning up. Coki: Why do we feel like two strangers talking? Sarah: What? Coki: Don't tiptoe around the problem. Sarah: What are you talking about? Coki: You're hiding something from me. Hey. Sarah: I'm not hiding anything from you. Yes, a lot of things have been happening in my life lately. I just want to make sure what it is, before I involve you, okay? Coki: Here, I thought I was a part of your life. Sarah: Coki, what is this? Hey. Come on, Coki. Listen. Coki: You don't think I can solve your problems. You think I'm too weak. You are the best thing in my life. And I wouldn't do anything to taint it. Tony: Do you think he could've survived? Ros: I don't know. Do you? Well, no Demit has ever survived one in the heart. Ros: What would you do if you were bored with me? What would you do? I would leave you. So would I. That was a trick question. I know. Ros: Guess I know what's gonna happen once we get the Gift. Tony: Hey! What are you do-- Look at you! An early riser! You want to find a nine to five job now, huh? Gotta be neat and ugly. What do you know about the guy that Sarah's been drawing? What guy? We've been best friends forever. All right? Before you and I ever met Sarah. Seriously, Coki, I don't know anything about that guy, and Sarah doesn't as well. You don't sound like yourself. What's wrong? Nothing. Hey! Oh. Mm. Hi. Whoa, babe. Thank you. Okay! Um, yeah. Mmm. Huh? Gusti: Okay. Me first. Then you. Marni: Feels like I'm going through far too much effort to meet a gabal. It's almost insulting. Then, why bother? Power attracts all kinds of shit. Speak for yourself. I'm doing this for balance. And what makes you think I'm doing it for anything else? Well, it's not in your... nature. Juragan: During colonial times... Chinese immigrants brought their needles with them. Their skills are different from ours, but I trust them. Of course, sir. Gusti: I understand that completely. Juragan: Do you, Detective? Because I'm putting my trust in you, and that's a very rare thing for me. Well, with all due respect, sir, trust is a... two-way street. What is that supposed to mean? No, no, no. I'm curious. What is that supposed to mean? Why is the girl any different? Isn't it my job to keep the Demits hidden? Ah. But this is the part... where you have to trust me, too. Right? You have the luxury of not knowing as much as I do, Detective, and you don't want to lose that. Yes, sir. You can tell the Palasik to come in. Yes, sir. Juragan: He's not telling me everything. Marni: Then why don't you just kill him? Because he's still of use to me. A man like that... not only keeps his own secrets, he keeps other people's secrets as well. Why don't we talk about you instead? I know it was you who ripped the tattoo off that fool. I can find out where he got it from. I don't need you to do that. Then what do you need? I need you... to tell me what you want. I want the Gift. That's really not up to me, is it? It's up to your elders. But you are the priest. Only you can conduct the ritual when it happens. I need to know that I can trust you. What can I do to prove it? I need you to pledge your allegiance to me and no one else. I need something from you. Anything. Your eye. It's just a small cut. Your replacement. Consider your eye the blood seal to our new understanding. If it takes you such a long time in handling such a small task... how could I expect you to handle anything bigger? Hey. Hey. It's pretty exciting, eh? A lot of people showed up. You nervous? No. But hey... I wrote you a new song. What's it about? Guess you're gonna have to find out. Okay. Well... good luck. 'Kay. You never kiss me like that anymore. You know what? Forget about it. I'm just gonna go look around. Coki: You know, I always hated when, you know, there's some guy up on stage singing to one girl. It sucks. I know, I know. But... when it comes to this girl, I... words can't really describe her. If you will let me... this one's for her. Hey, babe. Hmm! Have we met before? You're still breathing, aren't you? Yeah. Then no. We haven't met. Oh, you're a player, aren't you? I like it when they play. So... you wanna buy me a drink? Buy you a drink? Yeah! After that, you can do whatever you want to me. I'm JT, by the way. I'm tired of this. Should we go back inside? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. All you bitches are the same. You just love to tease me. You just love to tease me and then just give up. Whoa, wait! Hey! Oh. Sarah: Coki. Stop! Stop! Coki, are you okay? It's all right. Fine. Coki. Coki. Coki! Man: Marni... We're closed!
