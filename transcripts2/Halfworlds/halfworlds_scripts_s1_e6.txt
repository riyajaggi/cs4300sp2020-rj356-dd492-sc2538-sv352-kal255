 Hi, there! We're looking for a spare part. We heard that you have the original. Guard: You've got the wrong place. Ros: Really? We've been referred by a trusted source. You crawl like a dog. We told you all we wanted was a spare part. Do you believe me now? Sarah: Why is this happening to me? What do you have to do with it? Barata: I received the last Gift... 300 years ago. I am a half-breed. I was born of two worlds. My mother was human. My father was a Demit. The Gift was my destiny. And now you share in that destiny. You're a half-breed. Where are you going? This is not the usual route. Get back to the main route. Do you hear me? Tony: And now... for the final symbol. Hmm. Terima kasih. I heard there were fatalities with the Tuyuls. They've gone rogue, sir. It's a bad omen. Do you know what's special about them, Detective? No, sir. They choose to have a master, because it's in their nature to serve. I have an assignment for you. I'm listening, sir. There's a present by the door. You'll find everything you need inside. Pick it up on your way out. Barata: Do you know how it feels to have the blood of thousands on your hands? Including your entire family? It's unbearable. And for as long as you live, you will receive the Gift. Just like I did. Sarah: What if I don't want it? Barata: You don't really have a choice. Sarah: Well, what if I kill myself? Barata: Then you'd better do it very soon. Because after that... you become immortal. Just like me. Three hundred years ago... when you received the Gift, how many Demit died? Thousands. How many humans? Tens of thousands. Kill me. What? I saw you carry your weapon when you came here. So finish the job and kill me. Pi? Pi! Oh, Pi, you up? Oh, thank God! - I was so worried, Pi. - Sarah. I can't hear you. What? Sarah. Please get me-- Please get me Sarah. Sarah's not here. It's just-- it's just me. Sarah. Just get her. All right. Just stay put. Sarah: What do you think I'll do once I receive the Gift? Will I be able to control it? I don't know. What happened to you? Were you able to control it? My anger controlled me. So, no. I guess I wasn't controlled at all. You know none of it matters, right? No matter what you do... it's your destiny. Yeah, well, fuck destiny. Cut it off me. Barata: Are you ready? Okay? What the fuck! What were you doing here? That's none of your business. I think it kinda is my business. Coki: I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell is going on! Sarah: No! Stop! Coki: Fight me! Gusti: Most Demit take longer to recover whenever they get stabbed by a Demit blade. You're a stronger one. So you don't want to kill me? I know who you are. So you know who I'm working for. Of course. Gusti: So you know, deep down, he wants me to bring you in alive. Barata: I'm not so sure about that part. Well, I think he respects you. You're quite the legend. Now... did you really think that she would be your salvation? Pinung's up. I have a confession. Confession? Well, I didn't want to be dying again and shit, and be thinking about it and not telling you. What are you talking about? Your folio. You didn't actually lose it or misplace it. I didn't? When you left it at the shop the other night... I found it and threw it away. Okay, well, why would you do that? I saw the way Coki sang to you. And... it was like he was singing it to your soul. And I wanted that more than you could ever believe. Well-- That's funny. 'Cause... Coki and I just had a huge fight. I feel guilty about it. Coki's a nice guy. He doesn't deserve this. It's not fair for him. Surprise, surprise. Looks like you're not the only one after me, Detective. Shut up! Are you sure you can figure this out on your own? I'm taking him to Juragan. This is a direct order from him. You're saying his name like mortals say their god's name. You can't run. They're fast. They're getting closer, Detective. Oh cut the crap, Detective! There's only one move here and you know exactly what it is! The end is here, half-breed. We'll execute you in the name of Demit-kind. Mommy? Who are you? Mommy's not here. You can come back later.
