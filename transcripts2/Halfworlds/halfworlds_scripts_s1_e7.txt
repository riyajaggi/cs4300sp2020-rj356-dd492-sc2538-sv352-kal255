 Tony: The end is here... half-breed. We'll execute you in the name of Demit-kind. All of you have failed me. Now it's my turn. Gorga: The Gift turned out to be a nightmare. And its blessing was a curse... which fell upon all Demit. But even then, in the darkest of moments... when all was thought to be lost... some stood up for what was right.

 While others failed those they love the most. Sarah: Hey. You're okay? Still worried about me? You should get some rest. Come on. I've slept too long. I'm fresh now. Let me see that. Do you still remember anything about them? Yeah. Of course. Those memories are all that I have left of them. How? How can I forget?

 I envy you. At least you can really hold on to what little time you had with them. What's on your mind? You know, all this time... we've just been waiting around like sitting ducks. While they come here and destroy our lives. Look at what happened to you. But I'm still alive. Yeah. But they'll come back again and... Next time you might not be this lucky. So what are you gonna do? I'm going to find the Palasik. Pinung: What? All I know is that... is that this... must mean something. Remember these? Yeah. Sarah: Pi. There are some things you need to know. Do you see that? They never kill anyone in the open like that. Barata: Just like 300 years ago. It seemed like the whole world was going mad. I was trying to keep her safe from him. Who? Your dear boss, of course. What does he want from her? Oh, Detective. Are we playing the same game, or are you just that naive? Tell me what he wants from her. She's a half-breed. Just like me. The Gift is hers, whether she wants it or not. Pinung: Wait. I thought it was removed by Barata, so it shouldn't be there anymore. I missed you so much. I love you. What happened to us, Sarah? I don't know. Ros: What the fuck. I never knew they were so aggressive. Closer to the Gift, things always get crazy. Could be better or worse. Depends on the outcome of the Gift. Have we decided which one of us should take it? You, right? Are you sure? 'Cause I still don't know what to do with it. Well, we talked about it. You'll make yourself the most powerful Demit that has ever lived. How do I do that? You'll find out once you get it. It will be amazing. Trust me. No. I don't care. Then what do you really care about? Us. We're fine. We can't even touch each other without trying to be somebody else. What are you doing? What? Tony! My life is in your hand. You can push it in a little deeper, then rip it out. And I'll die. That's how much I love you. There's nothing... can make me want to live this long. Nothing, but you. Okay, okay. I'll be okay. Tony: Come here. Thanks. I thought since you're gonna stay awake looking at her, you might need that. I'm scared for her. She's going after that... that thing that hurt me. Look, from now on, the three of us need to start sticking together. Especially Sarah. All she's been through by herself. I don't think she's ever gonna forgive me. What I did. What I said. To be honest, I don't even blame her. No, no. Things were just getting a little crazy, you know? We're not being us. You're always there for me, Pi. You need to know how worried I was. All right? When I saw you just lying there, I-- I don't know what I'd do. I don't know how I'd live if you died. Shit. Don't worry about it. I've always known, Pi. And it's nothing to feel bad about or embarrassed. These things... These things happen. It's just... sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to. Sarah and I... How corny do I sound right now? You're so fucking cheesy. You know what, you're just a lousy pop singer passing off as a rockstar. Shut up! You are! You could've done better. Seriously. Maybe. Gusti: All right, tell me what will happen tomorrow. I didn't know I was going to receive the Gift, until the priestess, your dear boss' ancestor, told me so. Then she convinced me. That if I didn't do what I did... it would be the end of mankind. And what exactly did you do? I could control the minds of all Demits. And I made them slaughter each other. Only a few survived. And only because I... I eventually lost my power. Why did you choose mankind over the Demits? Because I thought I was doing the right thing. Barata: He may corrupt her. Just like his ancestor corrupted me. Now that you know that... what will you do about it, Detective? Sorry! If you're here for a tattoo, we're closed. Oh, no, no. I'm here to see you. Who are you? Could you come out here so we can talk? Why would I wanna do that? You have your mother's eyes. What are you talking about? I have something important to tell you. But I can't share that information with you here. They could be watching. You're just full of shit. I have information about your mother's whereabouts. Listen, what kind of a sick joke you're playing, just drop it, okay? Your mother's name is Hayati. She's a very pretty woman from West Sumatra. You think you lost her and your father during the riot. Yes. They were killed by-- Your father was killed. But your mother was only wounded. No. No, I saw her, okay? I saw them die. Did you see her body? Visit her grave? Exactly. If you want to know where your mother is... come with me. Mm-hmm. Yes! Marvelous. You've done a great job as always. Now leave. My next appointment shall be arriving soon. Hmm! Mommy? Who are you? I'm a friend of your mommy. Mommy's not here. You can come back later. It's all right. I'd like to speak with you instead. Just you and me. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Aw. Fine. If you do not want to talk, I will do the talking. Since we have all night, I have a story to tell. Gorga: Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He had quite a temper. Some would call him a hot head. He was weak. Always angry at the world. Then he realized he could take back what belonged to him. He would do anything to climb to the top. Now... I need a favor from your mommy. And you're going to help me, sayang. Tari... do you think that your Mommy loves you? Yes. I don't think so. He seems to be breathing. He is. Recovering just a little, so he can savor his last moments in agony. Oh. You're so cruel. Am I? Yeah! So, what's the plan? They will bring the other two to us. Why is that? Because they think I will give them the one that you have. Why did you give me the first symbol? Why did you choose me to be the receiver of the Gift? You tell me. I think because we're not so different when it comes to weathering the storm. We do not trust anyone else except ourselves behind the steering wheel. It doesn't mean that we're bad. It just shows that we are in control. After all... we are born leaders. Pi! Pi, get up! What? It's Sarah. I can't find her. What? Sarah! She's gone. Pinung: She's not upstairs. Do you think she went back to her place? Barefoot? God. You forgot to cover your carpet.
