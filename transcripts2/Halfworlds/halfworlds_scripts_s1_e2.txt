 Ah! Oh... Hi. Hi. Metal. Oh. Oh... Mm. Mm. Hassan: The gods made the Demit in a fire mountain. But the same mountain which gave birth to them...

 bore the seeds of their destruction. For only a blade forged from the sacred mountain can kill a Demit. And many were fashioned for this dark purpose. As the Gods left life and death in their wake, they also left them hope. The Gods promised the Demit they would return with a Gift, and it should be given to the most worthy of them all. The chosen one had to bring the three sacred symbols

 to the altar. And the Gods would let their favorite children know when the time of the Gift was at hand. Hey, you're not working. Have you seen my folio? You sure you didn't leave it at Coki's or maybe at the Moth? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I didn't. You'll find it. Well, I have to. It's kind of important, especially now. You can always draw them again. Such a cool artist. I can't. It doesn't work that way. Well... which drawing do you need? The one with the Palasik. Oh, you mean the one with woman's head with her insides hanging out? You know, it's not funny. Of course not. Do you have any books on them? Palasik? No... There's this thing called the Internet... You know I don't have a computer. What's with this obsession? You don't understand. Well, then, make me understand. I really don't get it. Why is this so important? I don't have time. Man: Who are you? Who-- Who are you? I'm a friend of Eddie's. Eddie is dead. I know he's dead. You didn't answer my question. I'm a cop. It's not like in the movies. We don't flash our badges. I'm here to get my sketches back. What sketches? I gave Eddie-- lent Eddie-- some of my sketches, and now I want them back. What's your problem with cops? You can find a thick file on me in your station, I'm sure of it. But you got nothing on me now. I'm clean. So, if you're done interrogating me, I'm out of here. Wait. Now... you wouldn't be breaking into a crime scene... in the name of... art. Now, what's the proof that these are yours? What's that? It's nothing. They're just drawings. What do you want? I want you to do me a favor. What? Have a little faith in people. Here. I'm gonna need your address. I don't have an address. Come on, I won't tell your parents. I don't have parents either. Man: It's kinda hot in here. I'm Tony. Is that your best line? I'm sorry. I guess I'm the shy type. A vodka martini, please, and whatever the lady would like. Vodka martini with a lemon twist. Yeah. Thank you. Wh-- what's your name? You can call me Ros. And you don't have to try so hard to impress me. And you are beautiful. That's corny. Sorry, excuse me. That was mine. It's okay. Another one, please. Yeah. I was speaking to her. Hello? Tony: Hello, sorry. Oh, wow... You have a good heart. What? Your heart, it's got a strong beat. Hmm. Fucking weird. Don't spill it. Whoa! Shit! Easy. Babe, I always come through here. Next time, call my name, or scream, or just say something. What's up? Coki: Something's wrong. A friend got killed. What? Eddie. He used to give me food all the time. Oh... God. I'm so sorry. Sarah... Don't want to sound like a dick, here, but this guy is literally all over your floor. Who is he? No one, and I'm being completely honest with you. Please just throw them away for me. Now why would I want to do that? I love you... so it kills me to see you sad like this. I'm not sad anymore. Liar. Oh, Detective. This isn't a very fancy place for a date. Really? Still too fancy for you? You carry on like that, your next date will be the cemetery. What do you want, Marni? What the fuck? This symbol hasn't been seen in 300 years. Just in time. And you need to collect all three to receive the Gift? You know a bit too much for a gabal, don't you? Why don't you just draw them yourself, make your own parchments? It's the greatest taboo for our kind. If any of us dare to recreate it, he or she will be killed anyway. Well, Firad's dead. So I heard. So who's going to receive the Gift? I don't know that yet. But it's going to be very interesting, isn't it? Juragan, I'd like to meet him. You know, he doesn't like your kind sullying his workspace. I'm sure you understand. Well, as you've probably guessed, our kind are beginning to doubt whether your boss can keep things in order at all. He's a far cry from what his ancestors used to be. But that's an easy fix. What he needs now are allies, and I'm sure he'd be very upset to hear that... you were getting in the way of that. I'm going to need this. That's why I came to you... All right. Detective. Fuck off, Marni. "Happy Resting Place." Are you sure this is it? Sure I'm sure. Knock, knock! Well, well, well. See? I'm happy already. He left for this? He likes living with the dead. Ros: Ah! Tony! Ah. Hassan. Ros: It's been far too long. How long has it been, Tony? It's been years. Hassan... you're really forgetting something, aren't you? We're fast. Tell me... what do you like most about humans? They know they will die. We know we will die too. I mean, the Demit blades, they always do the trick. You made plenty of them back in the day. What do you want? The elders, of course. Like you used to be. Where are they meeting? He'll kill me if I tell you. Who will? Juragan. Juragan? He'll send her. Is that what you fear? That something might happen to your mortal lady? Tony: You know your eye won't grow back. Tell us where the lair is. Ah! Ouch. Juragan: You know, the lobster is a very strange creature. Do you know why? Untuk Juragan. Lobsters grow by molting. You understand? Gusti: No I don't understand, sir. I don't watch documentaries. Juragan: Hm. Too busy keeping our streets safe? Lobsters grow by molting, or shedding their shells. After they lose their shells, they grow a new, harder shell. Now... imagine the pain... of losing your skin. I've got something to show you, sir. Show me. I'm sure you can recognize it. So this is the lost symbol. Hm. Good work. Where's the Demit who is supposed to receive the Gift? Firad? He's dead, sir. Who killed him? I'm still trying to figure it out. Uh, probably some Demit who's trying to... receive the Gift? Why not give it to one of the Demit you trust? You need allies. I don't think I should buy them out. That's insulting. I'm sorry sir. That's not what I meant. You believe that, don't you? That I'm... still in charge of keeping order here. Yes, I do believe in that, sir. We live in a half-world, where demons live among us, and for many generations, it has been my family's duty to keep this world in balance. Yes, sir. Good. You're a good man, Detective. You can go. Oh and, uh... don't forget to watch those documentaries. They are rather refreshing. And, um, there's-- there's another thing, sir. There's a girl who may know too much. About? About the others. Her parents got killed by Nadia and now she's snooping around. Should I take care of her, sir? No. Aren't we supposed to keep the half-world a secret? What should I do about her, sir? Well... you are a policeman, Detective. "To serve and to protect." Keep an eye on the girl. Marlon, shithead. Oh! Jeez! Wh-- Don't do that! Sorry! Wait, is that my folio? Yeah. Wh-- where did you find this? Was it at the Moth or was it at your place? Dude, this area is so creepy. You think we can go somewhere? There's something I have to tell you. It's about... the Palasik. Pinung: The first recorded history of the Palasik is actually pretty recent. Maybe about 300 years ago. Sarah: That's not recent. Pinung: Dude, it is, compared to the other creatures from legends. The origins of the Palasik were tied to reports of fetuses being stolen while they're still in their mother's stomach. Sarah: Stolen, how? Pinung: Palasiks suck them out. Thanks. Okay, if these things really do exist, how come no one's ever seen them? Because they don't look like that. They look like us. Whoa, what the hell just happened? Ah! Holy shit! Sarah: Do something! Pinung: Like what? Ah! Help! Ahh! It... it... it's you.
