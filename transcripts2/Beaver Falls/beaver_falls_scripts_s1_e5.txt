 Kimberley dumps Jake after he has bullied the misfits,publicly humiliating him, though she rejects Barry's efforts to muscle in on her. Bobby,aware that Pam has a tryst with Flynn for sex, diverts him by sending the trio of Brits and their charges on a country walk,where they get hopelessly lost as Bobby had hoped. However Jizz,the elected mute,breaks his silence to tell A-Rab that he has overheard Rachael,confused by the attentions she is receiving,plan to leave Beaver Falls. This spurs them all into getting back to the camp where Rachael and A-Rab are reconciled.

 Everyone's hooked up except me. Right now, who do you think's having a better time, me or A-Rab? What the hell are you doing here? I feel so, so stupid. You'll miss that. Repeat after me - it didn't mean anything. Something did happen. But it was just sex. I've taken into consideration the views of many great thinkers. The wisdom and teachings of Aristotle, Plato, Confucius. Even Charles Sheen.

 And I've come to one indisputable conclusion. Yeah! Love is fucked in the head. Is this about Rachael? I'm done apologising. She's not gonna forgive me. I'm moving on. So, what, you're giving up on her? I'm officially accepting defeat. I'm sorry, mate. I know how much you liked her. Hup. Yeah! Yaah! Another time, another place, she might have been here enjoying the beautiful game. Fruitball. No. Against official fruitball rules. Paragraph 12, no girls. Either way, we're out.What? Already? We're only on the third innings. Yo, shorties! Grab us some more fruit!

 Or anything vaguely fruit-shaped. Hello? Where are they? We told them it was a championship game. It's not their fault. It's love's fault.Oh, please. Love, sex, whatever. Those dogs don't have their eye on this ball any more. It could be worse.How? How the fuck could it be worse?! Shh! Someone's coming. They're coming back! What the hell? Hi. How are you? Who did this to you? Hey. How... How's it going? Are you serious? Just a bit of fun, babe... Dig'em out.Yeah, right! Jake. Talk? Come here. OK, so maybe it's a bit of a hazing but it's character-building stuff. Jacob, they're just kids! Um... OK, you know what? You don't tell me what to do. Look at them. They're terrified. This is a bit... undignified. And I really need to go to the washroom. Last chance. Or what, Kim? You gonna call the fat-kid police? Or... we're through. Oh, come on, grow up. Fine. I'll do it myself. Now there's no need to be like that. Are you gonna help me? No. Then there's every need. Fine. I'll see you later, then. There won't be a later. I'm sick of this, Jacob. Up to you. Let's go. Good luck digging those fatties out! If you need to talk or anything... you're single, I'm single. Alone... at last. Really? Well, I don't quite know what the right opening gambit is for a girl who's avoiding me. Because you always make such a point to check in with your conquests? Is that what this is about? You think you're just another conquest? Because you're not. You see, I don't know what to do now, because the only person I want to talk to when I'm confused is you. Flynn, I'm confused too. You think I don't feel bad about this? No, I know, and I know I'm the world's shittest friend for even being here but... I can't stop thinking about it. "What's going on? Why isn't she talking to me? What's she thinking?" You've turned me into a 13-year-old girl. I don't regret what happened, Rachael. Do you? It's not that simple, Flynn. There are things that I regret about it. I regret that A-Rab thinks it's all his fault. I regret having to lie to everyone. I regret... But do you regretit? Do you wish we hadn't? No. I don't wish that. But it's just it's all so complicated, Flynn. Anyways... I should probably get on. Yeah, me too. Some people say it's not the winning, er... that matters, it's the taking part. And, er... these are the sorts of people that end up wearing name tags at work. Which brings me to the moment you've all been waiting for... the results of the inter-bunk competition. Were we meant to be doing something? Now, you've been marked on teamwork and athletic prowess and extracurricular activity. And I'm proud to announce that for the tenth year running, cabin ten, come on up! Alongside this wonderful trophy, you get the kick-ass golden prize of a day out quad-biking through the wood. High-octane, high-powered fun. Jake, good man. Mm-hm. This is, er... This is for everybody that supported us, that didn't let us down, and who had faith in us. Who didn't act like a total bitch because she didn't get her fucking way! And that cup is yours to keep for a week because that's what Beaver Falls rewards... teamwork, success, and defeating those who are weaker than yourselves. Winners! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Yes! Ten years! Adios, losers! Where were you guys? Just your average day. A little polite conversation, some personal reflection, and being buried up to our necks by those jock philistines. Why do I feel like you're saying that's our fault? Well, luckily she was there to save our asses. She cares about us enough to stand up to Jake. Did they have an argument? Was she really angry? He dumped her and it's our fault. Actually, I believe she finished with Cro-Magnon man, not the other way round. Ah, look at the tiny little smile on his face. He actually thinks he's in with a chance. Hey. Hey. Can't believe the jocks won... How have you been? What were you saying? No, just, er... didn't even know there was an inter-bunk competition. I think it's, um... mentioned in the orientation pack. Yeah, really need to read that one of these days. Sorry. I'm really not great at the whole small-talk thing. Yeah, me neither. We should probably get used to it. Us. Friends. Yeah! It... It's good that you're... we're getting on with things. See you around, yeah? Everything all right? Fine. You seem a little bit upset.What? You know... No, I don't. What makes you think I'm upset? Nothing, just a... a feeling. If you want to get anything off your chest... Like what? I don't know. Anything... at all. Barry, this is cheap, even for you. I don't understand. You've obviously heard that I've split up with Jake so why don't you just come out and say it? You've split with Jake? No way. Oh, sure, Barry, because you're so sensitive and attuned to my moods, you just sensed something was wrong! They say dogs can see ghosts. Here's what I want - to be left alone to get on with my work. Here's what I don't want - an emotionally stunted man-child hoping to take advantage of my supposedly vulnerable state. I wasn't, and I'm not emotionally stunted or a man-child. The only difference between you and a 12-year-old is that a 12-year-old has an excuse for being immature. So you don't want to talk, then? Working hard, Mr Spencer? Hi. Yeah, just, er... just in the middle of doing the inventory. Only up to A for astronaut. How unusually dedicated of you. Feels like you've been less than attentive recently, Flynn. Let's make up for that. Yeah, sure. I've had a lot on my plate this week. Back to work, Mr Spencer. See you here after dinner. Could you give me a ride back to the lodge, please, Bobby? Of all people! In the camp! In full view! I mean, that... that's... Bobby, we talked about this. I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm single. No! You're... For 46 weeks of the year, maybe. But while you're here at my camp, you're my wife! You don't own me. I will not be treated this way! Sneaking around. Fucking a... fucking Englishman. He's Scottish. Do you really hate me that much? It's got nothing to do with you, nothing at all. You don't factor into it. I forbid you from seeing him. That's gonna be difficult, seeing as how I'm meeting him later. No, no. I'm fine, Mom. I just, er... I just really want to come home. No, it's... it's... been great. I'm just not having a good time any more. Yeah, so, I'll, erm... I'll see you soon, OK? Uh... yes. A taxi's coming at 8pm. I love you too. OK, bye. Dog, we going quad-biking on yo ass! Every year is the same, the jocks win the inter-bunk competition and you poor guys come last. So I thought to myself, "Bobby, what does Beaver Falls stand for? "Fairness, equality, the great outdoors for everyone!" Oh, I have got to find my driving gloves. But won't Jake and everyone be mad that we're getting their prize? Don't worry about them. They'll get their turn. But today... today you get to know what it feels like to be a winner. You get an amazing, invigorating day out in the woods! Very generous of you.Gentlemen, we leave in five minutes. Get ready, people. Quad-biking. It's almost better than fruitball. I don't get it. Where are the quad bikes? Well, who needs quad bikes if you got legs? But who needs legs if you've got quad bikes? Dude, you said this was a prize. But I also told your parents you wouldn't gain weight this year, and they pay the bills. This summer you've done nothing but come last, achieve nothing and go nowhere. So this afternoon, you are going for a good, long walk. But... There's no buts, gentlemen. This is it. The American frontier. The untamed wilderness. Bobby, this hardly seems fair. Yeah, I mean, I get why they don't get bikes, but what about us? OK, you've got your map, your compass, your rations and your wits, and I'll have your cellphones. Well, come on, I'm not stupid. The minute I turn my back, you guys will be on the phone calling a cab. If my mom calls, can you let her know it's OK and I found my blankie? I'll be sure to pass on that good news. Good luck out here, Spencer. Be a real shame if you didn't get back in time for any prior arrangements you might have. All you got to do is find your way back! Oh, and, er... don't worry, boys. The Brits invented Scouting, so I'm sure you're in safe hands. ENGINE STARTS This is bullshit! Why has Bobby suddenly got it in for us? All right, chin up, fellas. We'll get you through this. We are absolutely utterly, 100 per cent... doomed! Everything OK, buddy? I'm fine. You sure? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Are you... crying? Going around saying that she's the one who ended it, which is bullshit. Well, it's a screwed-up world, champ. Used to be simple. You know, men held open doors. Women curtsied, minded their p's and q's. Everyone knew their role. But now... damned if I know. The whole thing's out of whack. But you can't let it get you down. Hey, look at me. I mean it. People say time heals all wounds, you gotta roll with the punches. To hell with that. Life throws you a curve ball, you throw it back twice as hard and twice as fast. In the battle of the sexes, there can only be one winner. I can't hear cars... and I don't like it. We're here. Beaver Falls is here. So we need to make like the Pet Shop Boys and go west. Uh... who put the clown in charge? Shouldn't one of the grown-ups be map-reading? I am a grown-up. Can you actually map-read? Or is it like that time you said you could do karate? Yeah, my brother was in the Army. He taught me how to navigate. Dear God! There's a brother? They let these people breed twice? Yeah, funny, Smallie! Really funny. Guys, seriously. My stomach's saying, "Damn!" I'm emptier than Jizz's balls. Yes. When's dinner? I'm famished. Don't suppose that either of you picked up the rations? Thought you had them. Shit. Think we might have left them in the truck. Let's keep that between us, yeah? How long till we get back? Don't know. Three hours at a clip? OK, two hours till dinner! Really? By the time they realise there's no food, we'll be like an hour from camp. OK. Right, you all up for this? No. Do we have a choice? Ah, come on! It'll be fun. Just the lads together. I don't know what's worse. Him moping cos he's been dumped or him pretending not to mope cos he's been dumped. One team, one dream, yeah? We'll be back before you know it. Dear God! You wait till those endorphins kick in, lads. You'll feel amazing! What a dick! You OK? Never better. Bobby? Yes, Pamela? I honestly never set out to hurt you. Don't flatter yourself. I was just disappointed in the quality of man you choose to align yourself with. It's nothing to me. This was left in the truck. And so was this. Is it important? Er... no. Not at all. It's all good. Bobby... I know you're up to something. All these kids coming to me for advice, all totally messed up, and I'm thinking, "Hey, welcome to my world." I can't give 'em advice. I can't even help myself. Rachael, you're upset about A-Rab. No-one likes breaking up with someone, but you can't just turn tail, run for the hills. You've got to be adult about it. See? This is exactly what I mean. I keep talking about me and my issues. Are you OK? Yeah, I am. I'm not so sure about Jake, but hopefully he got it out of his system with that speech this morning. Mm. No way! Awesome! What is? Where did you get this? They're handing them out. Who was? The jocks. What is it? It's me, age 13. I can't believe he's done this! Really? What's with your nose? Rachael! Sorry. Remember all that stuff I said about being mature and handling things like an adult? Fuck that. This is war. Hell... Hello? Er... no, it's Bobby Jefferson, er... camp director. Oh, hello, Mrs Lowenhar. Er... no, Brandon's just gone for a short walk with his bunkmates. Er... oh, yes. Yes. I... I'm sure he'll be back very soon. Ha! All right. Bye now. Come on, lads. Faster. Oh, God. I don't get it. We should have hit this stream ages ago. No! Barry! You fucking dipshit! Look at the ground, moron! We're back at the fucking start! Now I know how Sisyphus felt. I don't get it. We've been going west the whole time. The compass must be fucked. Oh, yeah, that must be it, the compass, or maybe the Earth has shifted on its axis! Or maybe, just maybe, you are, in fact, a jackass. Why would Bobby give us a fucked-up compass? For the love of God! Feed me! Please. I'm so hungry. OK, er... about the food. It's a funny story. I left it on the truck. Well, come on, lads. Come on. Let's, er... stay positive, yeah? You three are literally the last people on this Earth I want in charge right now! You guys suck so much! I refuse to move another inch. We can't just stay here. Fine. You guys go off. We'll stay here. See you again in three hours, morons. 'Why, Bobby? Why?' 'Save us!' Get on the phone to the Meteorological Office. Double-check the weather report. Please. Politeness costs nothing, Bobby. Please... get on the fucking phone to the fucking Meteorological Office and double-check the fucking weather report. Better? Much. Red 52, hup! Raah! Uh! Ha! Boo-yah! Aaaargh! Take it easy, man. Losers take it easy. That was unnecessary. What?! Let's play some fucking ball. 'I'm sorry. Just give me one more chance. 'Please, Kim-Dog. You're my... You're my little puppy. 'And I'm your big doggy-woggy, right?' Right, now we just need to find a way to give A-Rab the same treatment. Oh, please, no. Oh, come on. If you're leaving, you might as well bow out in style. Show him not to mess with you. I can't. That's what they want you to think, that you're this poor helpless girl. No, Kimberley, I really can't. Look, it's not that he screwed me over. Well, I mean, he did. But... I kind of did something worse to him. Much worse. I can't wait to hear what a Rachael version of "much worse" is. I slept with Flynn. Bobby's such a twat. I mean, it's not like they suddenly expanded. They've been fat since they arrived. Maybe it's not about the kids. Do you know what? Who cares? Today is just what I needed - getting out of the camp, hanging with you guys, getting her out of my system. Yeah, it's great how you're so totally over her, how you're so totally not thinking about her right now! We should get moving. Nah, no, he'll come looking for us. It's not like Bobby's just gonna leave us out here. OK. If you had to eat one of them first, which one would it be? OK, guys, new plan, yeah? We're gonna sit tight, relax, and wait for Bobby to come and rescue us, how does that sound? Hm. You can't! Rachael's leaving. Tonight. So if you want to see her again... You can talk! Rachael's leaving? I heard her on the phone. She's going home at eight o'clock. All because he knobbed Saima? Hold on. We don't know that. Oh, fuck! I need to speak to her. Right, we need to go. Right, on your feet. We've got three hours to get back, even if it kills you. What? Jizz is talking. I don't like it. Yeah, cos if Jizz can talk, what else can talk? Oh, you little shits. My weed! Oh, they found it in your bag. They were hungry so they ate it, and now they're even hungrier. God, they're like locusts. They just eat everything in their path. Barry, forget about the stash. I need to get back. Right, let's move. We are never gonna make it! Move! You're tasty. If that bird don't shut up about my mom, I'll go fuck its beak up! Oh, this is brilliant. Just brilliant! Bobby. I, er... I need to tell you something. Are they back? What? The Brits. No. Where are they? Oh, er... just a little walk. Nothing to worry about. Will they be back soon? Course they will be. OK. It's just, I, er... I sort of wanted to say goodbye to them. I'm resigning, Bobby. There are some, er... personal issues which have... Well, they've made my position here untenable. Well, er... we all have personal issues, Rachael. No need to panic. We just have to deal with them, clean up our mess, and, er... hope there are no repercussions, personal, legal or otherwise. So did Rachael say why she was leaving? She's not happy here, not any more. So what's with the whole silent thing? If everyone just shuts up a bit, listens, they might work out what's really going on. Yeah? So, what's really going on? I know something's wrong with your hand, the way you keep touching it. I know something's going on with you and Pam. And I know you like Rachael too. I've seen the way you look at her. So I'm guessing right about now you don't know what to do. What is this? I have no idea. "Pam, I can't make it tonight. Busy. "Also I don't find you attractive. All the best, Flynn." Well, these things happen. You also spelt Flynn's name wrong. No, I didn't. Oh, Bobby, where are they? Who? You know who. Flynn, his friends, those little unpopular kids that follow them everywhere. I don't know. I know things haven't worked out the way you wanted, but if you've done something stupid... I think you're the one that did something stupid, Pam. At least some of us are trying to conduct ourselves with a little dignity. Jake! Bobby. Hey. Er... well, I can explain this. No, no, it's all right. A totally understandable bit of revenge in the heat of the moment. We've all done it. The important thing is not to take it too far. Aqua who? It's supposed to... Look, it doesn't matter. She humiliated me, man. Well, yes. I understand. Really. We see the world in, er... the same way. What do you mean? Well, maybe I decided to take a stand against those Brits, Flynn especially. And in the heat of the aforementioned moment, I maybe left them in the middle of nowhere with a faulty compass and a useless map. Fucking A! Thank you. But they had their bunk with them. Bobby. I know. No, I hate those guys as much as the next person, but those are American kids out there, stranded, and that's just wrong. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It is. Which is why you could be of some assistance to me. Now, just go out there, help me find them, and bring them back! Out there? Yeah. We can be like, you know, the Lone Ranger and... and Tonto. Or the two musketeers. Or Will and... and Grace. All right. Well, there's 20 square miles of woodland out there. Do you... Do you at least know where you left them? I remem... remember... trees. Lots of trees. For fuck's sake. Bobby's given us the wrong map. Yeah, it's for Beaver Falls. Beaver Falls... Pennsylvania! He gave us a broken compass and the wrong map? So we could be anywhere. We've been heading west and we don't even know if that's the way back to the camp. Er... no. Fucking hell! Dude. You should, like... chill. No, I will not fucking chill. I'll never see her again. Why? We wouldn't be stuck out here if you weren't so fat! A-Rab! Sorry. Look, it's not their fault, it's mine, all right? All of this. Bobby saw me with Pam. Hold on. You're porking Pam? We're being made to suffer because you're boning his wife? This is bullshit! And it's all your fault that Rachael and A-Rab can never be together! Guys! Listen! I can hear a river! Well, that should lead us to the camp. See? I told you I could navigate. Yeah, Barry. You're like a homing pigeon. Yeah, well, some of us have got it. Listen, mate, I'm sorry. Fried chicken's tomorrow. Whatever, dude! I'm going to have some nachos... I mean, aqua who? It doesn't even make sense. Ditch. I think Jake might have been going for aqua whore. Inspired! I can't believe how much crap I've accumulated. It's funny. I was so excited when I packed to come here. I think that's definitely trash-worthy now. No, I think I'll hold onto it. It'll remind me of how dumb I've been. You could stay and work it out, you know. It's not that complicated. Look, there's two guys. If everything was simple and you just had to pick one, could you? Is everyone OK? No, I bust my ankle. Totally busted, man. One minute we're up there and the next the ground disappeared. Where's A-Rab? Maybe Bobby was right, guys. We caused an actual landslide. How's it going down there? We need a new escape committee. Nearly got it! Almost there! We're stuck. Get your ass down here and help us. OK. No, don't. What? Let him go. Yeah, good plan. Better plan, he gets us out of here! He needs to see Rachael. He can e-mail her. A simple yet eloquent letter would suffice. He needs to see her. A-Rab, listen. But... No buts, just go! Hey, mate, piece of advice. Stop apologising. What? Trust me. Just stop apologising. She's not perfect. No-one is. We all make mistakes, man. Just tell her that, yeah? OK. Just... be careful, yeah? I'm going to get her back! Well, at least we know they've been here. Attention, Chunk Bunk! This is Bobby! I've come to save you! Please walk towards my voice! Oh, God. They could be anywhere. Still, it's good to get some quality time together. Just the two of us, Bobby and Jake. You know, I, er... I used to be a lot like you. Star of the football team, Beaver Falls celebrity. And, you know, me and Pam had our ups and downs, but, er... well, we got through it. And you and Kimberley will too, just like us. You know my mistake today? I let it out of the box. That's the problem. All aired. Usually I ram it down deep inside, screw that box shut. That's what you gotta do if you want to get on in life, hold down a relationship. Take that hurt and ram it down. Ram harder. Ram so hard, it never sees the light of day. So I guess the battery's dead. Yeah. Looks like it. Oh! Would you look at this? This shirt came from Paris. Paris! You're just gonna have to sit tight, lads. What if they can't find us again in the dark? I don't want to be here all night. It's all right, we're all in this together. Uh... guys? Other than Rick Jnr, what is big enough to do a shit that size? A bear? What was that? What... What was that? Come on. Oh, man! What was that? Shh! Shh! I couldn't tell you. Has anyone got any weaponry? Thank fuck! Evening. Think I've found a way to get you out. You could have shouted. What about Rachael? I couldn't just leave you here with these two losers. But she hasn't gone yet! Thurston, just forget it. We're still miles from camp. Yeah. We just need to focus on getting us all back to the camp safely. No, I know we can't make it moving at our speed, but we could at yours. We can make it if we all run. You've never run anywhere in your life! No, but I will run for you, A-Rab. I will, I swear. I'll run till my lungs explode, till my feet fall off. I will run for you. Who's with me? I will run for you, A-Rab. I will run for you, A-Rab. I will run for you in my heart. But seeing as my leg's fucked, someone's gonna have to carry my ass. Tell the taxi to wait. I know you want to say goodbye. I don't even know where they are and they're not answering their phones. Give it another five minutes. Let's face it, it's not gonna be this big happy ever after. That's actually quite sweet... Kim-Dog! Not sweet enough to take him back. Not even close. I'm gonna puke. I'm so gonna puke. Nipple rash! Nipple rash! Oh! Oh! Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on, man. Come on. I'll miss you too... R-Dog. Rachael! Stop! Please! Please. Oh, thank God. I thought we'd missed you. Oh, just bear with me. Bit of a stitch. Please... don't go. Just let me do my speech. Please don't do a speech. Hear me out. Hear me out. OK. Um... OK. Look, I'm so sorry about me and Saima. I thought we were done with the apologising. What he's trying to say is don't run away. Don't let what happened ruin everything, all right? That night... doesn't have to matter, unless you want it to. Yeah, that. He's better at this than me. It's not complicated. You just have to be honest. So what do you want? A-Rab. I want A-Rab. Told you she loved you! Really? Yes, really! Come on, guys. Let's give 'em some privacy. Come on, Barry. Saddle up! Move your ass! Hi. Wow. You smell interesting. And so damp too. Maybe I should take a shower. Maybe. A little too old to be playing horsey. Oh. He hurt himself. Can't walk. Fucked my ankle. You saved my life, man. Dude was a total legend. You and me, Barry, from now on, we're cool. I thought we were cool before. Sure, whatever. Well, well. You went out into the wilderness a child, and you came back a man carrying a child. Trot on. Nurse's office is just over there. You do know I'm not actually a horse, right? Hey, Barry, cheer up. Why the long face? Ba-dum-cha! Come on. Hey. OK, I'm clean. Mm, you're good. Take two? Yeah. Happily ever after. OK. Just keep your eye on the ball. The watermelon. A watermelon? Yeah, Barry says it's the ultimate fruitball. Please don't throw it too hard. Don't be such a baby. Rule number seven of fruitball, no babies allowed. OK. OK? Yup. Ready? Fruitball! Whoa, what the...?! Shit! Sorry! Rachael, are you OK? Ohh... Ow. Yeah. Don't say anything. I have to. It's OK. I'm sorry. You don't have to. I want to. If I'm lucky, they might let me play with the siren. Ow. Ooh. You all right? Yeah, fine. Told you. Paragraph 12. No girls are allowed to participate in the game of fruitball. Always ends in tears. You OK? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? It's just... I know. You know... About you and Rachael. World's least likely one-night stand. Oh. You know. Don't panic. I'm not gonna tell anyone. Rachael seemed to think that it meant something to you. Did it? Nah, you know me. Haven't got time for all that love stuff. Well, don't you start hitting on me. Barry would never forgive me. Whereas A-Rab... You think him and Rachael...? I hope so. It's what she wants. How are you feeling about going home? I don't see anything to look forward to. You have to tell Barry and A-Rab. You know how to ruin a moment. Yes, I do. I can't do this any more. Can A-Rab pull off his very own Hollywood ending? She slept with his best friend. It doesn't matter who your mates are as long as they've got your back. There's stuff you need to know about Flynn.
