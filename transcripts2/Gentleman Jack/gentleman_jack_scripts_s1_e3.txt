 You do know what people say about her, don't you? She's a bit like a man. Don't be absurd. I understand you're leasing out your coal. Per acre, 226 pounds, 17 shillings, and six pence. If I don't get my price, I shall sink my own pits. I think she's bluffing. We should just bide our time and see what happens. What she really needs is a good friend. And perhaps, she's found one. I think you're a little bit in love with me.

 I do have tender feelings for you. I'm going on this excursion with my cousin, Catherine. I wish you could come with us. I've been invited to a wedding. - I don't want to go. - Why don't you want to go? It's complicated. If you went, the thing that seems complicated might sort itself out. We're going to the Lake District. - Ma'am, Mrs. Stansfield Rawson and Miss Delia Rawson. - Oh, of course. - Show them in. - Oh, Miss Lister. - Mrs. Rawson.

 - Miss Rawson. - Do come in. How nice to see you. - How are you, my dear? - Miss Walker is very well indeed, better than she's been in a long time. And how are you? - I'm... I'm very well, thank you. - Good. - Sit down. - Well, as you have company, perhaps we ought to come back another time. - Oh, if you like. - You do look very well, my dear. Your trip to the Lake District with Catherine has obviously done you a power of good. She's talked about nothing else since she got home. - Your resemblance to your sister is remarkable, Miss Rawson, except the lips, I think, are fuller. - How surprised we all were, however, Miss Lister, when Catherine told us that you had turned up so unexpectedly. - Oh, really? - But I adore the Lake District. Wild horses wouldn't keep me away. Any excuse. And anyway, I had nothing else to do that afternoon. - You definitely think it's the right thing to do? - Yes. - She might laugh. - She'd be daft to laugh, situation she's in. - I worry about us not being able to speak the same language. - Oh, come. What you've got to be certain about is, is it what you want? - First time I saw her. When she stepped out of that high flyer and then spewed up, I knew. - Well, then, it's worth risking a refusal then, isn't it, if you feel like that? - You'll be me best man, won't you? Morning. - Hello, John. What's up? - We need your help. - Well, he does. - All right. - Well... I was... - He was wondering about asking Eugénie how she might feel about marrying me. - What? - Him, him. Not me. Him. - John Booth, you dark horse! - Yes, only, obviously, I'd need your help, Mrs. Cordingley, to ask her. - So hang on. You want me to propose by proxy for you? - Yes. - What do you think? - And to pass the baby off as yours? - Yes, obviously. - That's the point. Eh, but if you could tell her as well that I think she's very beautiful and I'd be very honored and I'd do everything I could to make her very happy. - Oh, isn't he lovely? If she won't have you, John, I will. - You do know, if she works it out, she'll sack you, and your feet won't touch the ground. - Babies come early all the time. - Eh... - Oui. - Really? - If we do go to Switzerland and Rome... - If? Sorry. When. When we go to Switzerland and then Rome, um, I can't go until after February. I've got people, friends, coming to stay, and I can't really put them off. I mean, I can, but it would just be easier if I didn't. - Of course. - But then once they've gone... - Of course. - I mean, in many ways, I'd like to put them off. I'd prefer it, but... - If the thing's been arranged, - you must stick with it. - Mm. - Sit down. I was so happy when you turned up in Eskdale. I'd been, um... I'd been feeling rather low, and I-I knew that if there was one face in the world I'd be delighted to see, it was yours, and then there you were! - Mm. - You know, um... before I went up there, that day, we were in my sitting room, and you said... Um... You implied that you... wanted to... Kiss me. And... and then you were embarrassed, but, well, you shouldn't have been. Because it doesn't frighten me. - Really? - Married? - Yes, ma'am. So we wondered if... if you... you c-could tell... Ask Miss Lister. - Eugénie is Anne's lady's maid, and you're outdoor staff, John, so strictly speaking, that's her juris... - Yes, I know that, but... She won't like it, will she? So... - So you want me to be the messenger that gets shot? It's sudden. - Yes, but sometimes, that's how it is. - I didn't know you spoke any French, John. - Oui. - I can't remember when I've spent so pleasant a day. - I wonder if tomorrow, you might pay a call, a sort of formal call on my aunt. - Of course, if you like. Thank you, James. Um, and then, tomorrow evening... would you like to come for dinner, and then... stay all night? Are you sure? - Where have you been? I was on the cusp of sending the servants out looking for you. It's past 10:00. It's pitch dark! You've been out all day. You didn't come back for dinner. No one knew where you were! I had to send for Dr. Kenny. - Why? - For Aunt Anne! She's had spasms in her stomach, not helped by the fact that she's been in a host of miseries wondering where you were, imagining you'd had your throat slit by a madman in the dark! Lock up! - Are you all right? - What happened? - Stomach cramps. I was only over at Lightcliffe. - Yes. - We didn't know that, did we? - Thank you, Marian. - You're impossible. - Yes. - You're ridiculous. - You're so selfish! - Quite possibly. Now, I need to talk to Aunt Anne. - Will you, in future, think about others whilst you're living here? - Whilst... Yes, certainly. Thank you. - Oh! - Oh! Right, good night. - She worries about you. - She needn't. - But we all do. - As long as you're all right. - That's all that matters to me. - But where were you? It's been a rather unusual day, and a happy one. I was with Miss Walker. We've become friends. She confides in me. We talk about all sorts of things. I think she's become really rather fond of me. I had begun to wonder... Not that anything's been said yet... If she might make a companion of me, for life. - And does she seem disinclined to marry? - She's 29. - She's 12 years younger than you. Can't imagine she's your intellectual equal. - Would that matter, if our tastes were the same and we were fond of one another? Is she vulgar? - No. - I thought the aunt was a bit, but not her. But where you would live? - Here, at Shibden. Not that anything's been said yet. - But would she leave Crow Nest? It's very elegant. - Shibden could be elegant. Shibden will be elegant. - You know I want you to be happy, above all things, but her tribe will have things to say. - What could be better for them? Hmm? Two respectable landed ladies living together as companions. They wouldn't have to worry about her anymore, would they? She has 2 1/2 thousand a year, 2 of it entirely at her disposal. Wouldn't you say that was a prudent match? - Yes, of course, if you were a man. - Nature played a challenging trick on me, didn't she, putting a bold spirit like mine in this vessel, in which I'm obliged to wear frills and petticoats? Well, I refuse to be cowed by it. - People can be very cruel. - Shame on them. - I don't want you to be hurt. - Sometimes, if we want to be happy, we have to risk getting hurt. - This is Halifax. They don't mince words. - They can't touch me. - I bet you don't read at the breakfast table when you're at Langton with the Norcliffes, or when she's staying at Lawton Hall with Mrs. Lawton, or when you were in Hastings with Miss Hobart. - You're quite right, Marian, of course. - I am anxious that the whole thing hasn't been properly addressed. - I'm sorry. - The whole thing? - Anne has assured me that in future, if she decides to stay out later than usual, she'll write us a note or tell us in advance. - It was only 10:00 when she came in, though, wasn't it? - If we'd known to expect her at 10:00, this would be a very different conversation. - You see, you've heard about people who get knocked about and robbed. - As it wa... - And worse. - As it was... - She used to come in at all hours. - I had Cordingley and Hemingway poised on the verge of going out looking for her! - I found her once at a lodging house in Halifax at 3:00 in the morning, - playing cards... - It's too easy. - With a bunch of reprobates from the 33rd. Good Lord. That was a while since. - Perhaps she'd like to apologize to the servants for keeping them up. - I'm not apologizing to my own servants. No one asked them... - The servants. - Oh, it's about that. - Of course it is. - It's about respect for other people... - Whatever it starts off as, it always comes back to that. - No, it doesn't! Well, why wouldn't it? Am I supposed to take it lying down, the fact that my sister... You certainly wouldn't... Has cheated me out of what is rightly half mine! - No, no, no, no, no. - You're going to have to let this go, Marian, for your own health. It's becoming an obsession, and it was never rightly half yours. It was entirely at Uncle James' disposal who he left the estate to, and we all know why he did. - I shall get married! - I shall get married! - Oh, really? Oh, good. - And I shall have a child... Yes, really... a son. - Congratulations. - And one day, he will... - You better look sharp about it, Marian... - You think I have no life outside these four walls? - Because you're no spring chicken. - Oh, you are sowing the wind hourly, daily, minute by minute, and you will reap the whirlwind! - Where are you going? You're not going to get married right now, are you, Marian? Good heavens. There's no stopping her. We better get the banns read. - You can sneer all you like, but one day, I shall have a son, and he will have a greater claim to Shibden than you, and then, then... then, we shall see! - You're going to give birth to spite me? Well, I do hope this husband is someone worthy of marrying my sister and fathering a Lister. - He won't be a Lister! - Hmm. - Rachel, I'd like you to pack my imperial. I'm going to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Dyson in Market Weighton for a few weeks. I'll write ahead and explain. - Now, ma'am? - Yes, now! - Morning. - Morning, ma'am. - Morning. - Morning, ma'am. - Thomas. - Dick. - Ma'am. - Sowden. - Morning, ma'am. - Morning, Pickels. - Morning, missus. - You made a start. - Cracking on while the weather's with us. - I see you've got Sam Sowden working for you. - Aye, well, uh, I needed someone with a cart for stone, and the fella I normally use is off on another job. - Is he pulling his weight? - Summat up, Bob? - Ah, no, you're right, Sam. - Has he been drinking? - I ha... I don't... - It's five-and-twenty to 10:00 in the morning. - I don't think he's, uh... - Are you scared of him? - How do you mean? - Then why are you defending him? - As I say, I needed a cart, so... - William Hardcastle over at Roydelands - has a good cart. - Well, maybe, but this one's here now, so... - You shall soon see this sort of thing just doesn't do for me. Are you gonna say something, or shall I? - Eh? - Sowden! - Ah? - What's the matter? - You're not working for me in that state. You'll have to go home. - What state? - I don't want to fall out with you twice, but if I have to, I will. - What state? - Don't deny it. You'll just dig yourself deeper. Send one of your lads over to Roydelands. Tell Hardcastle Miss Lister will consider it a great favor if we could borrow his cart. Tell him I'll give him two shillings on top of whatever you've allocated for the job. - Hang on, hang on, hang on. What's she accusing me of? - You'd better get off home, Sam. - She seri'sly suggesting I come to work whatever time it is drunk? 'Cause if you are... I mean, if she is, I don't care who she is. I... - You're drunk, Sowden. Thomas, I want you to take your father home, and then I want you to come back. - A'ight. - All right. Know what you are, don't you, eh? - Eh? - Now, let's keep it polite. - She's a fella. - Hey! Now get him off home now! - Fella in a frock. - Hey, come on, Sam. - Ah, go on, go on, show us your cock. Come on. - Stop it! - Just calm down! - Mean, "ca... "? - Come on, Sam. - I didn't start anything. - I don't... I don't... - Sam! - All right, all right. How did we get here? - And tomorrow, Sowden... Are you listening to me? When you're sober, if you're sober, I'd like you to come up to the hall, and we can have a very quiet, very thoughtful conversation about your tenancy. You what? - Take him home. - Go with him. Make sure he gets him home. Unbe... This is... - Sit down. - Didn't even do anything! - Idiot. - Lot of shouting this morning, Marian and Anne. Can't think what about. I never really listen. Well, I can't hear... Which could be a blessing. - I-I remember what it was. Oh. Hail to the chief. - Mr. Rawson. - Miss Lister. I'm sorry to hear you've had a contretemps with your sister. - Oh, I don't think so. Marian and I rarely argue about anything. Shall we be brief? - Well, I... I got your note about the other party offering you your price. Um, I have to be frank. My brother and I are amazed. - Well, there you have it. If you want to better the offer I've had, then now's your chance, but as I said before, I remain indifferent about selling my coals or not. - Well, I had naively thought that you might be more reasonable to deal with. - More reasonable? Oh, you mean softer. - No, madam, I meant more reasonable. - Well, now you know me better. I have heard a good deal about coal in the last few days and weeks, and rather than find me easier to bargain with, I'm afraid now you'll find me harder. So, £226, 17 shillings and sixpence per acre to be paid per annum in two half-yearly installments, the first of which to be made on signing the deed. You have ten years to get the coal in. If not got in that time, I'll allow you a further term, not exceeding five years. Oh, and if it causes you no great upset, I'd like provision made in the lease for me to go down your Law Hill pit. - Why? - Why? - Because it fascinates me. You'll access the bed from your Law Hill pit, and I'd like to see it. That's all. - Well, I'm sure it can be arranged, but it's hardly something to put in a lease. I have to talk to my... My brother. - Of course you would. I have to go. I'll send a note to Mr. Parker to draw up the lease. I've already been through the details with him. And then he'll be in touch with you about signing it. - What's happened? - Nowt. Finished work for the day. - That's all. - I thought... Well, didn't Mr. Pickels say it were a couple weeks of a job? - Yeah, it was. - It is. Right, I'm going back, and I'm taking the cart. - You're going nowhere, you little runt. Cart stays here. - I'm sick of being tarred by the same brush as him. - Aren't they getting Mr. Hardcastle's cart? - Yeah, well, they'll have two if we take this one back. - You're going nowhere! Told you. You can piss off an' all. - What are you doing? - Off you trot! - We're gonna get thrown off farm, all 'cause he can't do even part of a day's work without getting drunk and opening his stupid, nasty mouth! - Gosh. - Sam, please don't! Please, leave him alone! - Sam, stop it, please! - Get off! - Leave him alone, please! Sam, leave him alone! - Stop it! - G... stop! - Leave him, Sam! - Don't! - Please! - You're gonna kill him! - Stop it! - Sam, please, leave him alone! - Squeak, piggy. Squeak! - Stop it! - You stupid bitch. - No! - No! - Get off me! - Get off me! Get off me, you... - Alfie! Alfie, there's a rope in t'cart! Get that rope! Get it! - Get off! - Stop wriggling! - Agh! - Stop wriggling, you pig! - You're a fucking bastard! - Shut your dirty mouth. - You better... - Anne... I think... - I'm afraid there's been - a change of plan. - Oh? - Well, nothing to do with this, us, and all to do with Marian being ridiculous and irritating. - Oh, dear. - So... mm... Bit of a bust-up, so she's off to Market Weighton. - I'm sorry. - Huh? - Don't be. So... so I think we... Let's wait a day or two, let the dust settle, and then... And then we'll pay your call on my aunt. - But you'll still come to me for dinner this evening? - Of course. - And stay all night? Ah... - They had to send for a doctor last night for my aunt. Now, with her... madam... Going off to Market Weighton, it would look very bad if I left her with just the servants all night. Sorry. It's... bad timing, I know, but... I will still come to dinner, and stay for a little while, if that's... - And then, another time, when the dust's settled... and soon, we can... - I'd like that. Um, there was something else I wanted to, um... tell you. I've had a letter. It's about you. - Married? - Apparently, so would you tell Caligula? - Well, Eugénie speaks no English, and he surely doesn't speak any French. - I agreed to be the messenger. Anne will no doubt get to the nub of it, effortlessly and in her own manner. - Oh, I wish you and Anne wouldn't argue. - She's the one that... - I know, I know. Eh, might you get married? Is there someone? - I have twice been invited to tea at Dr. and Mrs. Kenny's when Mr. John Abbott has been invited, too, and... he and I have become, well, friendly. - John Abbott? - Yes. - Is he not something in wool? - Yes, but he's also a founder member of the Halifax Joint Stock Banking Company, and he owns property in Australia and New Zealand. Nothing's been said, but he has intimated to Mrs. Kenny that he's, well... really rather fond of me. Anyway, look, I shan't be gone for more than two weeks, and if you need me, write. I'll come straight back. Oh, and please, don't tell Anne about Mr. Abbott. I shouldn't have said what I said this morning, but she just makes me so cross! - Are you all right? - This is written by someone who knows nothing about me. It's so poisonous. It's so cowardly. - I suppose it wasn't meant for your eyes, but... I wanted you to see it, because I wanted you to know that I don't care what anyone says about you, not least someone who daren't even put their name to their work. - Got to go see how my aunt is. I'll see you this evening. Can I take this? - Mm. James, were you riding on the back of Miss Walker's carriage the other week, when that accident happened - above my house? - Yes, ma'am. - So you were facing the gig, then? As I understand it, the gig that forced its way through and caused all the bother. - Yes, ma'am. - The boy lost a leg. Any information would be useful. - Well, the only thing: after it all happened, William Bell, our groom, said he could swear blind that the driver was Mr. Rawson himself. - It's Mr. Rawson, Mr. Parker. - Mr. Parker. - Mr. Rawson. - There's a problem. - I have come to terms, Parker, with Miss Lister's ridiculous price, and I will even sign to say she can go down my Law Hill pit, under certain conditions, so surely now... - It's... There's this other thing. I had assumed that we were talking about the upper bed and the lower bed for the named price, but here, it seems that we're buying just the lower bed, and that is the richest seam, but obviously, it's the upper bed we're... interested in as well. - Has your client any real intention of sealing this deal, Mr. Parker, or is she just playing some impenetrable game, the point of which is to vex me? We're men of business. We like to shake hands and move forward, not jump through endless hoops of her whimsical, idiotic, and ill-informed construction. - I think of all the criticisms one might level at Miss Lister, that, um, "whimsical, idiotic, and ill-informed" are rather wide of the mark. - Was this not clarified in all these conversations you've been having with her? - I was talking about whole surface measure, which normally would mean the upper bed and the lower bed. She has specified in this lease "sufficient measure," which, when you read it closely, she's talking just about the lower bed. - Both beds, or no deal. Your client, Mr. Parker, needs to learn to stop wasting my time. Perhaps you could spell that out to her. Welly! - He's messed his pants. - Has he? - He offered me sixpence to untie him. - He hasn't got sixpence. - No, I know. - Mr. Pickels was grateful to have the cart back, you'll be thrilled to learn. - You'd better untie me. - How do we know you won't start throwing your weight around again? - Someone comes along here and finds me like this, you ain't gonna last two minutes, lad. - Thing is, no one ever does come out here, do they? I mean, not out here. Nobody visits us, do they? 'Cause nobody likes us. - Miss Lister is expecting me at the hall tomorrow. I mean, you think she ain't gonna come snooping around here if I don't turn up, huh? Aye. Never thought about that, did you? Elsie. - Amy! - A note just arrived, ma'am, from Mr. Jeremiah Rawson's servant. - Madam, I am at a loss to account for the misunderstanding between us. I considered by "sufficient measure," you meant both the lower and upper bed, and that was the only consideration that induced me to offer such an enormous price. - I'm off. 10:00. - I'm going to send John. - You're not going to send John. - I'm going to send John. I do not like you walking home alone. - Fine, send John, but tell him not to arrive any earlier than 9:35. - You cannot walk back from Lightcliffe in 25 minutes. - I can walk anywhere in 25 minutes. - Well, John can't! - Well, then, I shall be approximately five minutes later than 10:00, and only because of John. Try not to lose any more colonies, Captain. - What'd she say? - Nothing. - Where's she going? - John, just to warn you, is getting married. - John? - We'll have this conversation later. - This John? - Our John? - Who to? - And, um... - Who's John getting married to? - There's something worse. - Well, not... - Worse? - Um, Marian. - Marian? Marian's getting married? Who to? Not to John, I trust... Or maybe they are. What do I know? Marian. Does Marian even... Really? - Marian's getting married? - No, no, no. - Who is John getting married to? - Look, I said I wouldn't say anything. I want you to have a nice evening, so off you pop, and we'll talk about this later. - No, we set off at 5:00 a.m. We didn't get back until 20 past midnight. - No! - I'm afraid I tired my poor friend, Miss McLaine, out. Not a morsel of food to eat all day, but yes, I'd quite happily spend so much more time in the highlands. Oh, I had a letter, um, earlier this evening, from my friend, Mrs. Ainsworth. I think I told you about them this morning. Um, it turns out that he... Mr. Ainsworth... Has applied for a position as clerk at the Lightcliffe church, and he has a meeting... Interview... The week after next with the trustees, so they want to come and stay then instead of January, and... Well, I know you said you wanted to wait until after February to travel because of your aunt, but the p... The point is, from my point of view, we could be off sooner. - I wanted to ask you something. I wanted to ask, when we come back from the Continent, whether... You see, the thing is, I shall never get married, ever, and if you felt that you might never get married either... and you were prepared to give up all thought of ever having children, I wondered if, on our return, might we not live together, set up home together, as companions? It'd be like a marriage. - Quite as good, or better. I do wonder, though. You see, I think I told you that I've always been very fond of children, and whilst... giving birth isn't something that I'd want and whilst I always thought that I would never marry, I did at one time feel an inclination not to keep to that, so... it's difficult to positively say that I might never feel that same inclination again. - Oh. - So rather than give you a yes now, could we wait six months? - Six months? - Well, it is, is it not, the same as a proposal, and would it not be prudent in any... in all circumstances for both parties to fully consider everything that... - Of course. Of course it would. It is exactly like a proposal, and six months is April. Shall we say the third? It's my birthday. - Is it? - Mm. I can wait that long, as long as I have reason to hope. - Oh, I... I think you have every reason to hope. - Evening. - I'm calling for Miss Lister. - Who is it, Harry? - It's only me, Mr. Priestley. John Booth, from Shibden Hall. - Oh. What can we do for you, John? - Well, I've come for Miss Lister. - Miss Lister? - To walk her back. - Hello, John. - Hello, Mrs. Priestley. - Miss Lister isn't here. - Oh, uh, she's set off? - No, she's not been here since, uh... When was Anne here? - Uh, Tuesday. - Oh, was she not here last night or the night before that? I've come to the wrong house. They said Lightcliffe, so I assumed... Oh, I am sorry. I've disturbed you. - Don't worry, John. - Well, where is she, then? - Well, happen she's at Miss Walker's. - Surely you care enough about me to say yes. You do realize you'll break my heart now if you say no. Wait, stop. - Sorry, what? - It's... It's just too much. It's too soon. - Did I hurt you? - No, it's not that. - It's... It's too soon. I'm not... - Not what? - I don't know. - Does it feel wrong? - No... Not the kissing, but just th-this. I just... I don't know. - I'm sorry. - Sorry. No, I'm sorry. - Have I spoiled everything? - No. - I just... I... I've never done this before, and probably not very good at it. I don't want to disappoint you. - You haven't. You haven't. Ann... - Oh. - That'll be John. - Have you done this before? - No, of course not. - What are you looking at? - What? - Hmm? - Nothing. - Ma'am, so did, um, did anyone talk to you about me and... and... - You and... - Eugénie. - No. - Oh. - My aunt said you were getting married. Who to? Not Eugénie. No. Really? - She... we... - How? No, seriously, how? You don't even speak the same language. You have no French. She barely speaks any English. - No, but love is blind. - Rubbish. Love needs language to express itself. At a normal, prosaic level, marriage is a legal agreement that can't be negotiated by just gazing at someone. - Well, Mrs. Cordingley has a smattering, as you know... She was your lady's maid for a time... And yes, she's been very kind. It's not often I'm speechless, John! - No. - Well, I'm not sure it's something I can give my consent to, not very readily, anyway... not that I would ever wish to get in the way of someone's happiness, obviously. - No, ma'am. - Well... I shall speak to her. - Very good, ma'am. Oh, there was summat else. Miss Lister, it was just... - Keep up. - I went to New House just now first, instead of Crow Nest. Well, your aunt said Lightcliffe, so... And I assumed wrongly that you were with Mr. and Mrs. Priestley, so I disturbed them. I did apologize to them. Uh, they were very polite about it, but, uh, so... yeah. - Help me! - Help me! - Morning. - Help me. Help me! Come on, help me! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Agh! - Yeah, I wish I could believe you've learned a lesson, but I'm scared you haven't. See, I'm scared you never will. Can you see that this isn't the way to live, where everyone who should mean something to you is frightened of you every time you walk into a room, every time they hear your voice? Can you see that? Eh? Just say something. Come on, just say something that makes me think you've learned a lesson. - John Abbott? - She's been to tea twice at the Kennys' whilst Mr. Abbott was there. That's all. - He makes carpets, John Abbott. - Wool, yes, probably. - Either way, he's trade through and through. - I said I wouldn't say anything. - You're going to have to put the tin lid - on that one, Captain. - Mm. - Otherwise, I will. - Ooh, I'm going to get into trouble now. They were only having tea together. - Twice. I'm off to check on the men. Nonsense. You've done the right thing. Marian has no judgment. She always needs a steer in the right direction, but better coming from you, Father, rather than me. You know how ridiculous she gets. When she comes back, if she comes back. - Marian should get married. Do her good. Who cares if he's trade? If he has enough money and he cares about her, and they can make a life of it together... The world's moving forward, even if she isn't. - I might pop in at Crow Nest. Do you imagine she's ill... Miss Walker... If Miss Lister's been round there several nights in a row? - It's one possibility. - I might pop in. I don't want to be a busybody... But I might pop in. - Did you have any more trouble with Sam Sowden yesterday? - No, ma'am. Uh, Thomas brought the cart back, and then he worked like a trooper. - Good. - Thomas? - Come on, lad. - Morning, Miss Lister. - Will you... Good morning. Will you remind your father I'd like to see him today - up at the hall? - Yes, ma'am. - And if he doesn't come see me, I shall go and see him, and he'll like the consequences even less - if it comes to that. - Yes, ma'am. - And Thomas, tell him I appreciate him letting you bring the cart back. - Uh, I can't just... Sorry, ma'am. The thing is... I can work hard, even if me father isn't inclined, and... It'd be very hard on me mother and the little ones if... If we were to lose the farm. - Yes, but the problem is, Thomas, my agreement is with him, and he and I need to be better friends, and he needs to accept my authority, or the whole thing just doesn't work. - I'll be back later. - Yes, ma'am. Come on back to work, lad. - Uh, can I nip out, Mr. Pickels? I can leave cart here. Only if I don't remind him, he won't turn up. - Is she... - Yes, ma'am. - Ann? - I'm so glad you're here. - What's happened? - Nothing. - It's just, after last night, I didn't think you'd come back. - Ah. You'll find me a lot more constant than that. - I don't deserve you. I'm not good enough for you. You're so clever and interesting. You'll soon get fed up with me. - Ann, you've got to stop having such a poor opinion of yourself. Hmm? You're clever, and you're interesting. - Do you still want us to live together? - Need you ask? I was so terrified I might never see you again. - Why? - Because of... last night. Because I couldn't give you what you wanted. - These things take time. - Ma! Ma! - What, is summat up? - Miss Lister wants to see him up at the hall. I'm going to have to let him loose. I was wondering if you should walk the little ones into Halifax for a while, and then, if he kicks off and lashes out, they'll be out of the way. - What about you? - I can run faster than him, if he starts anything. - Alf, go find Amy. - We're going into Halifax. And you, just be careful, and run. If you have to, just run. - Miss Lister wants to see you up at the hall, and God knows you have some talking to do, 'cause she isn't happy with you, so I don't know. I don't know. Oh, I don't know. The thing is, even if I let you loose and you went up there, chances are, she'd just kick us off anyway, way she were talking, so I don't know. But you better say the right thing. You should get yourself cleaned up and say the right thing to her. - I'll kill you! - I'll kill you! Get me off this fucking chair! Get me out of this fucking chair! Untie me! Get me out of this chair! Get me off this fucking chair! Untie me! I'm gonna rip your innards through your asshole, you little sod! Untie me! I'll kill you! - You know one of the only things I ever learned from you, eh? - Get me off this fucking chair! - Eh? You ignorant bastard! When I were little, "The thing about a hungry pig," you said, "is that it'll eat anything and everything. Absolutely..." "Anything." - Good morning! - Morning, ma'am. - I'm sorry to be... Just, I noticed the blinds were down, and I wondered is Miss Walker ill? - No, ma'am, she's with Miss Lister. I love you. - Don't knock. - Sorry, ma'am? - What? What are you doing? - Nothing. - You were... you were... - I'm not feeling well. Miss Lister's been looking after me. - Oh, I see. Is that what you call it? - Sorry? - For years, I have defended you against comments. - Eliza... - Don't you "Eliza" me! Your aunt has been in a host of miseries with you staying out late, and this... You... You're playing with fire. Do you understand? Both of you. Oh. - Is everything all right, Miss Walker? - Yes, thank you, James. Should we go upstairs? It appears you have my niece quite under your spell, Miss Lister. I'd rather think she has me under hers. I've had a tenant... disappeared. How's things with Tom? Any sign of him? The Rawsons. They've been stealing my coal. I told you, it's a nasty business. I've had a letter from Mr. Ainsworth. Do you think I should marry him? If you take him, you'd have to give me up. If I did, it would be out of duty. Do you really think that I'm someone to have my future happiness decided by fate? You're going to have to make a decision.
