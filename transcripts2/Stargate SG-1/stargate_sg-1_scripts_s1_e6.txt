 WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE ? BURN HIM. FOR A PLANET WITH THE U.V. RADIATION AS HIGH AS THIS ONE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE, THE PLANT LIFE SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL. APPARENTLY ABYDOS WAS THE EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE, AS FAR AS TREES ARE CONCERNED. THAT MAKES SENSE. FOR A PLANET TO SUPPORT HUMAN LIFE, THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF CARBON-BASED VEGETATION, RIGHT ? IT IS NO ACCIDENT. MANY STARGATE WORLDS WERE TERRAFORMED BY THE GOA'ULDS CENTURIES AGO. OKAY, LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AROUND THE GATE... BEFORE WE MOVE OUT TO FIND SG-9. IT CAN'T BE THAT FAR. I DON'T KNOW. THIS STARGATE IS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. I DOUBT IT PLAYS AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ANYBODY'S CULTURE. IS THERE A PROBLEM, DR. CARTER ?

 NO BIRDS. THERE SHOULD BE A ROAD UP HERE OR SOMETHING, OR-- JACK ? GUYS ? OKAY, OKAY, DON'T SHOOT. THAT'S VERY SOUND ADVICE. COLONEL O'NEILL ! LIEUTENANT CONNOR ? ALL RIGHT, COME ON. ALL RIGHT, CONNOR, WHAT'S GOIN' ON ? COMMAND RECEIVED YOUR SIGNAL SIX HOURS AGO, AND NO ONE CAME THROUGH. WHY ? HANSON. - WHERE IS HE ?  WE NEED TO TALK-- - NO ! DON'T. WHY ? FRAKES. HE-- [ O'Neill ] CONNOR ? CONNOR, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. PERMISSION TO SPEAK FREELY ABOUT A SUPERIOR OFFICER, SIR ? YEAH, GO AHEAD. HE'S LOST IT.  HE'S OUT OF CONTROL. - CAPTAIN HANSON ? - MAYBE IT WAS THE SUN,  THE RADIATION. - ARE YOU SAYING THE SUN  DID THIS TO FRAKES ? - NO, SIR. - CAPTAIN HANSON  DID THAT TO FRAKES. - WHAT ? - FOR TRYING TO GET BACK  THROUGH THE GATE. - I DON'T BUY THAT. SIR, WE WERE TRYING TO WARN COMMAND ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. THE PEOPLE HERE, THEY BELIEVE HE'S THEIR GOD. - BECAUSE YOU CAME  THROUGH THE STARGATE. - NO, NO, YOU DON'T GET IT. HANSON BELIEVES IT TOO. CARTER ? I WANT YOU TO TAKE CONNOR BACK THROUGH THE STARGATE. REPORT TO GENERAL HAMMOND WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE. NO, SIR. "NO, SIR" ? IF YOU'RE GOING AFTER CAPTAIN HANSON, I SHOULD GO WITH YOU. I CAN GET TO HIM. LOOK, CAPTAIN. EITHER WE'RE BRINGING HIM BACK TO FACE A COURT-MARTIAL OR NOT. I THINK WE BOTH KNOW WHAT THE "NOT" MEANS. I KNOW HIM, COLONEL. THAT WOULD BE THE PROBLEM. I GAVE BACK THE RING BECAUSE I KNOW HIM. I KNOW HOW HE THINKS, HOW HE OPERATES. HOW HE LIKES TO PLAY GOD ? I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN ANY MORE THAN YOU DO, BUT IF SG-1 IS GOING AFTER HIM, THEN I AM GOING WITH YOU. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS, PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF THEM. HE'S THEIR GOD. THEY'LL DIE FOR HIM, KILL FOR HIM IN A HEARTBEAT. THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM. I NEED SOMEONE TO REPORT BACK TO THE GENERAL, AND THAT IS YOU. NO, SIR. "NO, SIR" ? DOES IT SAY "COLONEL" ANYWHERE ON MY UNIFORM ? I KNOW THE PLANET, THE SITUATION. I THINK IT'S SUICIDE. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING, I'M GOING, SIR. YOU'RE NOT PHYSICALLY ABLE. FRAKES WAS MY FRIEND. THIS ISN'T ABOUT REVENGE. MAYBE NOT FOR YOU. WE GOTTA MOVE NOW, IN DAYLIGHT. [ Sighs ] WELL, WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD. I HOPE YOU PACKED LOTS OF SUNBLOCK. WE'LL, WE'RE MOSTLY UNDER COVER. THE PROBE'S DATA INDICATED THAT SHADE, EVEN HEAVY CLOUD COVER, WON'T PROTECT US. IT CAN BE POURING RAIN, AND WE'LL STILL BURN. SHE'S RIGHT. THEN WHY ON EARTH ARE WE TRAVELING DURING THE DAY ? WE'RE NOT ON EARTH. PEOPLE HERE LIVE IN CAVES. I THINK THEY USED TO BE MINES. THEY ONLY COME OUT AT NIGHT. THEY'RE PROBABLY STILL AFTER ME, SIR. TO OZ. YOU WERE RIGHT. THEY SENT SG-1. THIS TASTES LIKE CHICKEN. WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT ? IT'S MACARONI AND CHEESE. TEAL'C ? THE PERIMETER IS ESTABLISHED. [ Alarm Beeping ] PERFECT. IF ANY LITTLE ROCKS SNEAK UP ON US, WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF WARNING. SO, ANY INDIGENOUS LIONS, TIGERS OR BEARS... I SHOULD LIE AWAKE WORRYING ABOUT ? THE PLANT LIFE'S ALL THAT SEEMS TO LIVE VERY LONG IN THE SUN. NOW, HOW COULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN ? THE SG TEAMS ARE SUPPOSEDLY MADE UP OF WELL-TRAINED PROFESSIONALS. WHEN WE FIRST MET THE CAVE-DWELLERS, THEY BOWED DOWN TO US, THOUGHT WE WERE GODS. THAT'S A FAIRLY COMMON PHENOMENON. - I MEAN, IT HAPPENS. - EXCEPT HANSON DIDN'T DENY IT. TOLD US IT MIGHT BE SAFER IF WE ALLOWED THEM TO BELIEVE HE WAS THEIR GOD FOR A WHILE. HE SAID IT WAS THE "SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT" THEY NEEDED TO RETAKE THEIR WORLD. AND YOU WERE OKAY WITH THAT ? FRAKES WAS OUR ANTHROPOLOGIST. HE AGREED WITH HANSON THAT IT MIGHT BE SAFER. BUT THE LONGER WE STAYED HERE, THE STRONGER THEY BELIEVED. IN OUR FOURTH OR FIFTH WEEK HERE, A YOUNG CHILD WANDERED OUT OF THE CAVES AND MUST'VE GOTTEN LOST. HANSON WENT OUT AFTER HIM. HE WAS GONE FOR TWO FULL DAYS BEFORE HE CAME BACK... CARRYING THE CHILD BARELY ALIVE IN HIS ARMS. THE CAVE-DWELLERS MUST'VE LOVED HIM FOR THAT. YEAH, THEY DID. HE WASN'T THE SAME AFTER THAT. - YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S WHAT SENT  HIM OVER EDGE ? THE SUN ? - IT WASN'T ANY ONE THING. IF IT WAS, ME AND FRAKES, WE COULD'VE SEEN IT COMIN'. - DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT  BEFORE-- - BEFORE WHAT ? THERE WERE A FEW CAVE-DWELLERS WHO GOT THE IDEA... THAT HANSON WAS JUST A MAN LIKE THEY WERE, THANKS TO FRAKES AND I. HE HAD THEM TIED TO STAKES AND LEFT OUT IN THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT. IF THEY LIVED SEVEN DAYS, THEY WERE ALLOWED BACK IN THE CAVES. A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT BIBLICAL EVENTS TOOK PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF SEVEN DAYS. BY THEN THEY WERE BLIND. GIANT, BLEEDING BURNS ALL OVER THEM. JUST TOOK THEM A LITTLE LONGER TO DIE. PERSONALLY, I'D RATHER EAT A BULLET. I'LL TAKE FIRST WATCH. HEY, COLONEL, I'LL TAKE WATCH NOW. [ Whispering ] LET'S GO. WE GOT COMPANY. - ARE YOU SURE ? - PRETTY SURE. - [ Shouting ] - [ Alarm Beeping ] [ Machine Gun Fire ] [ Frightened Shouting ] [ Teal'c ] IT APPEARS THEY ARE GONE. YEAH. CONNOR ? CONNOR ? [ Hanson ] THE TEMPLE IS TAKING TOO LONG TO BUILD. -THEY'RE WORKING  AS HARD AS THEY CAN. - BUT NOT AS LONG AS THEY CAN. DIVIDE THEM INTO SHIFTS, DAY AND NIGHT. YOU CAN'T. WHAT ? THEY'LL DIE. SACRIFICE. THEIR WAY TO SALVATION. THEY WERE PROBABLY INSTRUCTED JUST TO TAKE CONNOR, SEND US A MESSAGE THAT HANSON'S IN CONTROL. SOUNDS FAMILIAR. WHICH PART ? HE LIKES CONTROL. OH. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN HIM ? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR THE LUNATIC FRINGE. HE WAS--  HE WAS CHARMING. THAT'S GOOD. CHARMING IS GOOD. I SHOULD BE MORE SURPRISED BY THIS THAN I AM, BUT I'M NOT. HE HAD THIS IN HIM, DANIEL. TOO MANY YEARS OF BLACK OPS. THAT'S TYPICAL OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S EVALUATION OF SOLDIERS. THE CRAZIER THEY ARE, THE MORE EXTREME THE SITUATION THEY SEEM TO BE PUT INTO. HE WASN'T HAPPY WHEN I BROKE OFF THE ENGAGEMENT, BUT HE SEEMED LIKE HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER WHEN WE MET AT STARGATE COMMAND. APPARENTLY NOT. WHAT'VE YOU GOT, TEAL'C ? THIS WAY. [ Teal'c ] THE ROAD OUT OF THE VALLEY-- TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN. I'LL BE BACK IN 30 MINUTES. - IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT  RESCUING CONNOR-- -NOT YET. CAPTAIN ? WHEN THE TIME COMES, I'LL NEED YOUR HELP TO GET IN THE FRONT DOOR. I'M PREPARED FOR THAT, SIR. [ Teal'c ] THERE WILL BE NONE LEFT TO WORSHIP HIM IF THIS CONTINUES. THEY'RE LIKE ABRAHAM. WHO WAS ABRAHAM ? A BIBLICAL FIGURE... BELIEVED TO BE THE FATHER OF MAN. GOD TESTED HIS FAITH BY INSTRUCTING HIM TO MAKE A GREAT SACRIFICE. HIS SON ISAAC. DID HE SACRIFICE HIS SON ? HE GAVE IT A GOOD SHOT BEFORE AN ANGEL STOPPED HIM... AT THE LAST MINUTE. GET UP ! HE'S WORKED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT. HE NEEDS REST. SHUT UP ! [ Shouting ] DO I HAVE TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE ? DO I ? [ Groaning ] HEY, LOOK OVER THERE. WHOA. WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? - I CAN'T STAY HERE AND WATCH  HIM BEAT THAT MAN TO DEATH. - YOU WILL BE CAPTURED. - UH-HUH. - YOU THINK THAT'S A PLAN ? I CAN GET TO HANSON. THAT'S WHAT THE COLONEL WAS TALKING ABOUT. CAN YOU WAIT UNTIL HE GETS BACK ? THE MAN COULD BE DEAD BY THEN. WE SHOULD'VE STOPPED HER. WE WOULD HAVE FAILED. WELL, THAT WAS REFRESHING. CONNOR LOOKS BAD. THERE'S TWO GUARDS, BUT-- DANIEL ? UH-- [ Sighs ] NEVER MIND. IT'S PROBABLY OUR ONLY WAY IN WITHOUT A FIREFIGHT ANYWAY. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME. HELLO, JONAS. AND YOU NEVER THOUGHT I'D AMOUNT TO ANYTHING. QUITE A LEAP, ISN'T IT ? FROM CAPTAIN TO-- WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU, JONAS ? PLEASE, SIT DOWN. THESE CAVES WERE ONCE MINES. THEY PERMEATE THE HILLSIDE FOR MILES, BUT THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLYING LIKE RABBITS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DIG THEMSELVES MORE SPACE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO LEAVE THE CAVES. IT'S LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IN A BOTTLE. - AND YOU THINK  YOU'RE SAVING THEM ? - OH, I KNOW I AM. THESE PEOPLE, THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS. THEY'RE LIKE US. HOW CAN WE TURN OUR BACKS ON THEM ? KIDNAPPED FROM EARTH, FORCED INTO SLAVERY FOR CENTURIES ! - WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT. - YES, WE CAN ! WE MUST HELP ! HOW DOES POSING AS A GOD AND SLOWLY WORKING THESE PEOPLE TO DEATH HELP THEM ? I HATE THAT WORD ! STOP USING IT ! I AM NOT POSING ! IT IS A MATTER OF DEFINITION. MY PEOPLE NEED ME. THEY BELIEVE IN ME. - AND BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE,  THEY WORK. - TO DEATH. WE'RE BUILDING A CIVILIZATION, SAM. THERE ARE GOING TO BE SACRIFICES. IT'S BETTER THAN ROTTING IN CAVES, LIVING AND DYING IN SQUALOR LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ! I'M CREATING A GREAT PEOPLE. - IN YOUR IMAGE ? - YES ! IT'S GOING TO BE WONDROUS ! YOU'LL SEE. YOU'LL SEE. [ O'Neill ] WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET ONE OF THEM ALONE, TALK TO HIM. [ Teal'c ] THEY COULD GIVE US AWAY. [ Daniel ] MAYBE NOT. MAYBE NOT. I THINK I'VE GOT JUST THE CANDIDATE. SHH. I REALLY WISH I UNDERSTOOD THESE DRAWINGS. WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR PEOPLE ? ALL KNOWING. - YOU KNEW I WOULD COME,  DIDN'T YOU ? - HOW COULD YOU NOT ? HEALER OF THE EMOTIONALLY WOUNDED. I WAS YOUR ONE FAILURE. THE BIRD WITH THE BROKEN WING THAT WOULDN'T HEAL. YOU SEEM TO BE FLYING WELL ENOUGH ON YOUR OWN. I HOPED THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND. I DO UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE SICK AND YOU NEED HELP. THAT YOUR IDEA OF HELP ? YES. YOU'RE COMING BACK WITH ME. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE IT, SAM. GO ON. IT'S STILL LOADED. PULL THE TRIGGER. DO IT ! BECAUSE, SO HELP ME, THAT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA STOP ME. WHAT'S A FEW DEATHS COMPARED TO THE SURVIVAL OFMYPEOPLE ? KILLING THEIR SAVIOR MIGHT IRRITATE THEM A LITTLE, BUT AT LEAST I'D BE GONE. DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS. GO ON, PULL THE TRIGGER... ONE MORE FRACTION OF AN INCH. YOU HAD THE GUN. YOU APPEARED TO HAVE ALL... THE POWER. YET I WAS IN CONTROL. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF A GOD. MY NAME IS JAMALA. JAMALA. - PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. - NO, WE WON'T. JONAS SAID YOU WOULD COME. DEVILS WITH POWERS LIKE HIM, HERE TO DESTROY US. NO ! NO, WE'RE NOT... DEVILS. WE'RE MEN LIKE YOURSELF. I'M DANIEL, THIS IS JACK AND HE'S TEAL'C. HI. - IS HE JAFFA ? - YES. - DON'T KILL ME. -NO, IT'S OKAY. HE'S FRIENDLY.  HE'S A FRIEND. SEE ? SMILE. LOOK FRIENDLY. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. HOW DO YOU KNOW HE IS JAFFA ? HAVE YOU SEEN ONE BEFORE ? NO. JUST STORIES FROM WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY... LONG AGO. HE IS A SERVANT OF THE OLD GODS, YES ? WELL, YES AND NO. HE'S FROM ANOTHER PLACE. SO ARE WE. ANOTHER PLACE ? EARTH. IT'S WAY, WAY OUT THERE. WHERE WE'RE FROM. JONAS TOO. HE'S NOT A GOD,  HE'S JUST A MAN. A CRAZY MAN, GRANTED, BUT-- OKAY. OKAY. JONAS IS BAD. BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT. HE CAN'T HEAR YOU RIGHT NOW. HE CAN'T HURT YOU. BUT HE WILL IF YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN HIM AND FOLLOW HIM. - NO. HE WILL SAVE US ! - BY LABORING YOU IN THE SUN  UNTIL EXTINCTION ? IF WE FINISH THE TEMPLE, JONAS WILL MAKE THE SKY ORANGE. IT WILL BE SAFE TO COME OUT IN THE LIGHT. - THERE WILL BE  NO MORE SICKNESS. - THE SKY ORANGE ? - THE SKY. UP THERE. - [ Daniel Sighs ] I KNOW WHAT THE SKY IS. WHY ? WHEN THE SKY'S ORANGE, IT'S GOOD. - THERE'S NO MORE SICKNESS. - AND JONAS CAN MAKE  THE SKY ORANGE ? YES, HE CAN. - HOW DO YOU KNOW ? - HE SAYS HE CAN. - DO YOU KNOW WHAT  HE'S TALKIN' ABOUT ? - I BELIEVE SO. GOING TO BE MAGNIFICENT, ISN'T IT ? WHAT'S THE POINT, JONAS ? BY THE TIME IT'S BUILT, THERE'LL BE NO ONE LEFT TO WORSHIP YOU. PLEASE. MERE SURVIVAL FOR THESE PEOPLE WILL REQUIRE... UNQUESTIONING FAITH, PURE DEVOTION. THEY MUST BELIEVE INME... IF I AM TO LEAD THEM INTO THE DESERT, TO THE PROMISED LAND. I'M MERELY SEPARATING THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF. BESIDES, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE CRAZY, RIGHT ? I NEVER SAID YOU WERE CRAZY. BUT YOU THINK IT, DON'T YOU ? [ Laughs ] THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I STILL HAVE FAITH IN YOU, EVEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ME... YET. YOU'LL COME AROUND. I DON'T THINK SO, JONAS. COME HERE. [ Daniel ] WHAT IS IT ? IT IS SOMETHING I HAVE SEEN THE GOA'ULDS USE. IT CREATES AN ENERGY FORCE HIGH IN THE AIR. WHAT, PROTECTION FROM RADIATION, LIKE THIS PLANET'S SUN ? THE DEVICE I SAW APPEARED TO TURN THE SKY ORANGE. THE CAVE PAINTINGS TELL OF THIS. THEY SHOW THIS SYMBOL. HAVE YOU EVER ACTUALLY SEEN ONE OF THESE THINGS HE'S TALKING ABOUT ? WHERE ? WHAT IS IT ? LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THE GOA'ULDS LEFT BEHIND. WHAT I'VE GATHERED FROM THE LOCAL FOLKLORE IS THAT THE ANCIENT GODS... USED IT TO MAKE THE SKY ORANGE... TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE FROM THE SUN SICKNESS. SOME SORT OF SHIELD. YES. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK IT. NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE. YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT MY COMING HERE BECAUSE YOU WANTED ME. YOU JUST WANTED ME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN THIS THING ON FOR YOU. OH, NO ! THAT'S NOT TRUE. I SINCERELY HOPE THAT ONE DAY... YOU WILL AGREE TO BE MY GODDESS. TURN IT ON. WHAT IF I WON'T ? THEN WE WILL WATCH EVERY LAST CAVE-DWELLER DIE IN THE SUN... BEFORE I KILL US BOTH. "HE HATH NOT FAILED  ONE WORD... OF HIS GOOD PROMISES." I'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS FOR YEARS. ALL ALONG I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR GOD, AND HERE I AM. SO, YOU BETRAYED YOUR GODS AS I AM BETRAYING MINE ? THE BEINGS I BETRAYED WERE NOT GODS. THEY HAD POWER. BUT POWER ALONE DOES NOT MAKE ONE A GOD. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? CAN'T LEAVE CONNOR OUT THERE ANOTHER DAY. HE'LL DIE. WE ALSO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CAPTAIN CARTER. BUT IF TEAL'C CAN TURN ON THIS DEVICE, WE COULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE HANSON'S POWER. THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH YOUR PLAN, DANIEL. DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TURN IT ON. - YES, I CAN TURN IT ON,  BUT THERE MUST BE TWO. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? THE SHIELD TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES A FORCE FIELD... BEING BOUNCED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO DEVICES. I HAVE ONLY SEEN ONE. IN HIS CAVE. HANSON MAY NOT KNOW HE NEEDS A SECOND DEVICE. THIS IS THE VALLEY. HERE'S THE STARGATE.  HERE'S THE TEMPLE. GOOD DRAWING. THANK YOU. WHERE WAS THE FIRST DEVICE FOUND ? THEN THE SECOND DEVICE-- YOU'RE ASSUMING THE GOA'ULDS JUST SHUT 'EM DOWN AND LEFT 'EM IN PLACE. - THAT IS CORRECT. - I'M SORRY, TEAL'C. YOUR CALCULATIONS COULD BE WAY OFF. CONNOR DOESN'T HAVE TIME FOR US TO BE WRONG. I'LL GO AFTER HIM. TRY AND FIND THAT SECOND DEVICE. I'LL TRY TO MEET YOU BACK HERE. THIS PLACE IS LIKE WHERE THE OTHER ONE WAS FOUND ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE TEMPLE. THIS IS LIKE SOLID ROCK. WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS. [ Tapping ] STAND ASIDE. [ Sighs ] I JUST HOPE IT STILL FUNCTIONS. AAH ! KILL ME. YOU SURE ? I'VE COME ALL THIS WAY. CAN YOU WALK ? LET'S GO. THINK WE COULD PICK UP THE PACE A LITTLE HERE ? [ Man Shouts ] [ Rifle Cocks ] HEY ! HOW YOU DOIN' ? WE'D LOVE TO STICK AROUND, BUT SOME BRAIN-DEAD SYCOPHANT... LEFT MY BUDDY OUT HERE TO DIE, SO WE'RE OUTTA HERE. OW. MOVE. MAIN CONTROL BOARD SEEMS TO FOLLOW... THE SAME BASIC CIRCUITRY PATTERNS AS THE GATE TECHNOLOGY. JUST TURN IT ON. WHAT IF I CAN'T ? COLONEL O'NEILL. CAPTAIN. I SEE EVERYTHING'S WORKING OUT JUSTAS WE PLANNED. - SHOOT HIM ! - NO ! ALL RIGHT, I'LL-- YOU'RE GONNA TURN THIS THING ON IN HERE ? DO IT NOW. IF IT WORKS, I'LL SPARE HIM. [ Device Activates ] IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WILL IT WORK ? I DO NOT KNOW. EVERYONE IS BEING FORCED TO GATHER AT THE CIRCLE OF THE GODS. THE STARGATE. MY CHILDREN, TODAY IS A GREAT DAY ! "THE SUN HATH STOOD STILL  IN THE HEAVENS... "AND HASTED NOT TO GO DOWN  ABOUT A WHOLE DAY. "I HAVE THE POWER  TO HELP... "AND TO CAST DOWN ! "BUT FEAR NOT. "STAND STILL... AND SEE THE SALVATION OF THE LORD." TODAY, WE WILL BURY THE DOORWAY... THAT BRINGS FORTH DEMONS WHO THREATEN TO UNDO US. BUT FIRST, I WILL SEND THOSE... EVIL UNDOERS WHO HAVE ALREADY INVADED OUR WORLD... BACK TO THE HELL FROM WHENCE THEY CAME. FEAR NOT, FOR I, THE LORD YOUR GOD, CONTROL THE GATEWAY TO THE UNDERWORLD. YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T KILL THEM. I'M NOT. I'M SENDING THEM BACK TO EARTH. WITHOUT SENDING THE SIGNAL TO OPEN THE IRIS, THEY'LL DIE. PLEASE, SAM. I'M HAVING A MOMENT HERE. "I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD ! THERE IS NOTHING I CANNOT DO." NO ONE IS GREATER THAT I ! NO ONE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN I ! THROW THEM IN. WAIT ! STOP ! BACK AWAY ! [ Daniel ] LISTEN TO ME. NO MATTER WHAT JONAS HAS SHOWN YOU OR DONE FOR YOU, HE IS NOT A GOD. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM ! THEY ARE DEMONS ! AGENTS OF THE DEVIL ! I AM YOUR SAVIOR ! WE'RE NOT DEMONS, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD ! THIS-- THIS-- THIS IS NOT MAGICAL POWER. IT IS CALLED A GUN, AND IT IS A MACHINE. DO AS I SAY OR YOU WILL ALL DIE ! DO AS HE SAYS AND YOU WILL DIE ! DO NOT BETRAY ME ! AFTER ALL I'VE DONE FOR YOU ! I PROMISED YOU I WOULD BRING YOU OUT OF THE CAVES, INTO THE LIGHT. TODAY... I FULFILL THAT PROMISE. BEHOLD... THE MAGICAL POWER THAT BELONGS TO YOUR GOD ! I GIVE YOU THE SUN ! I GIVE YOU THE WORLD ! WHAT'S WRONG ? I DON'T KNOW. FIX IT ! IT'S THE MACHINE. I CAN MAKE IT WORK AND SO CAN YOU, JUST LIKE JAMALA CAN FIRE THAT STAFF. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW. THERE ARE TWO DEVICES. BOTH MUST BE TURNED ON FOR THE SHIELD TO WORK. WATCH. [ Man ] LOOK ! LOOK ! I'M TAKING YOU WITH ME ! [ Shouting ] [ Screaming ] [ Crowd Cheering ] I THINK WE'RE READY. THINK WE SHOULD TELL THEM TO BURY THE GATE AFTER WE'RE GONE ? TEAL'C SEEMS TO THINK THE GOA'ULDS WON'T BE BACK. MAYBE WE SHOULD COME BACK AND CHECK ON THESE GUYS. I THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH. DON'T YOU ? SOMETHING ELSE ON YOUR MIND ? I HAD THE CHANCE TO END THIS, COLONEL. HE LITERALLY ASKED ME TO DO IT. KILLING A MAN IS NO BADGE OF HONOR, CAPTAIN. I KNOW. LOOK, I'M NO EXPERT ON THIS THING. I GENERALLY REMEMBER ONE COMMANDMENT. I THINK IT'S THE FIRST. "I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD,  AND YOU SHALL TAKE  NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME." OKAY, IT'S NOT THE FIRST ONE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE "NO KILLING" ONE. NO MATTER WHAT THE REASON, EVERY TIME YOU BREAK IT, YOU TAKE ONE STEP CLOSER TO HANSON. THANKS. SO, YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT ? YES. THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE CAVES-- IT'S VERY BIG, YES ? YEAH. IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. [ Device Activating ]
