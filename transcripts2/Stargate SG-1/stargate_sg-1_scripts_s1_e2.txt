 Stargate SG-1 (1997â€“2007): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Enemy Within - full transcript 
 The team, now designated SG-1 (initially there will be nine exploration teams in all, more will be added later) are planning their next foray through the gate as they try to map out the variety of sites available to them and locate their missing friends. O'Neill asks that Teal'c be allowed to join his team but Gen. Hammond thinks that will be unlikely given that he is the host for a Goa'uld. Unknown to anyone, however, is that O'Neill's close friend, Maj. Charles Kawalsky, leader of SG-2, has been infected by a Goa'uld, an immature version that has not yet taken complete control of the host. Kawalsky is having regular blackouts during which the Goa'uld is trying to return to the gate. An MRI reveals what is wrong but it's unlikely the creature that has fused itself to Kawalsky's spine can be surgically removed. Meanwhile, Col. Kennedy arrives to question Teal'c who has pledged his loyalty to his new world.

 Gentlemen, these planets,
designated P3-575 and P3A-577,
 have been submitted
by Captain Carter's team...
 as possible destinations
for your next mission.
 SG units one and two
will operate concurrently.
 You know, I'm kind of partial
to P3-575, if you don't mind
taking P3A-577.
 No, I'll take 577--
I'm not married to it.
 I want to be fair about this.
How about we flip a--
Go where I tell you.
 As far as I'm concerned--
[ Man ] Alert !
Inbound traveler !
 Repeat !
Inbound traveler.
 Damn, those Goa'ulds
are persistent.
 I think
we pissed them off.
 Closing the Iris.
 Alert !
All defense teams, stand by.
 - Set the base autodestruct
countdown at three minutes.
- [ Beeping ]
 [ Loud Banging ]
 We're not going anywhere
as long as the Goa'ulds
keep up these attacks.
 - They can't
keep this up forever.
- [ Banging Continues ]
 - Can they ?
- Wow.
 Once they realize
our gate's impenetrable,
they should just give up.
 Part of me just wants
to let 'em through; give 'em
the fight they're lookin' for.
 [ Loud Crackling ]
 [ Beeping ]
 Radiation team, move in.
 [ Geiger Counter Crackling ]
 Well, there have got to be
worse ways to go, I suppose.
 You don't think the Goa'ulds
are sending people through ?
 Be like bugs
on a windshield.
 - [ Man ]
Team reports all clear, sir.
- Stand down from alert.
 - And abort the countdown.
- [ Tapping Keyboard ]
 [ Gasping, Sighing ]
 Kawalsky,
what's the matter ?
 Headache.
I took a fistful of aspirin,
but nothing helps.
 Get down to the infirmary.
Get it checked out. Go on.
 Yes sir, I think I'll do that.
Sir, with your permission ?
 By all means, Major.
I need you to lead
your team to P3-575.
 [ Man ]
Inbound traveler.
Inbound traveler.
 Reset the counter.
Here we go again.
 All defense teams,
remain in position.
 [ Banging,
Steam Hissing ]
 So, this Iris
is gonna hold, right ?
 Pure titanium,
less than three micrometers
from the event horizon.
 It won't even allow matter
to fully reintegrate.
 So, this Iris
is gonna hold, right ?
 If it doesn't,
the fail-safe device
will detonate.
 This whole mountain
will vaporize, and there'll
be nothing to worry about.
 Ah ! Good.
I feel much better.
 [ Loud Banging
Continues ]
 [ Man ]
Come.
 I can understand how
Kawalsky feels. This job
gives me a headache too.
 Uh-huh.
What's the bad news,
General ?
 Not much for small talk,
are you, Colonel ?
 How was your weekend ?
Get any fishing in ?
 I'm rejecting your request
to have Teal'c join SG-1.
Wasn't my choice.
 Colonel Kennedy is en route
from the Pentagon right now.
 - He'll be asking
your friend some questions.
- What kind of questions ?
 What we're up against,
troop strength,
technology, weaponry.
 I'd like to know the answers
to those questions too, sir.
 But after they're done
asking them--
There's gonna be more questions.
 Possibly tests.
After all, he's carrying
the larval form...
 of a hostile
and very formidable enemy
inside his body.
 What kind of tests
are we talking about ?
 Maybe you haven't
noticed, Colonel,
[ Sighs ]
 but he is
the first alien species
we've actually run into.
 You don't think that qualifies
your friend as a subject
of scientific interest ?
 - A subject ?
- He is what he is, Colonel.
 With all due respect, sir,
I don't think he saved
the lives of my team...
 or came over to our side
so he could become...
 a damn guinea pig for
U.S. military intelligence.
 Back up, Colonel.
He switched sides once.
 Are you 100% positive
he won't switch back ?
 - Yes, sir.
- Well, you're alone
in that assertion.
 Colonel Kennedy arrives
within the hour.
 I promise Teal'c will be treated
with dignity and respect...
 for as long as he remains
a guest of this facility.
 Beyond that, I can't
promise a damn thing.
 Dismissed, Colonel.
 Hey !
Am I interrupting anything ?
Yes.
 Why don't I come back ?
 - The people from Chulak--
- We sent the last of them
back through the gate...
 just before the Goa'ulds
started knocking at the door.
 - Good.
- Well, thanks to you.
 So, how long
do you think
they'll keep it up ?
 One, perhaps
two more attempts.
 They will believe their weapons
have destroyed you.
 They will not send warriors
through for some time,
 to make sure
of your destruction.
 Well, they'll be in
for a surprise, huh ?
 Your Iris will be closed.
They will be crushed.
 Surprise !
 Am I a prisoner ?
 Uh... yeah.
 I understand.
 We're not exactly living up
to your expectations
of us, are we ?
 See, Teal'c, we've been
living alone in our
little corner of the galaxy...
 for quite a while,
and I think...
 the people I work for
just need to get to know you
a little better.
 I mean, your knowledge
of the Goa'ulds alone
makes them a little curious.
 - I will give
that knowledge freely.
- Yeah, I know you will.
 - And we'll put it to good use.
- I will pledge my allegiance
to this world.
 I'm just not sure that's
ever gonna be enough
for them to trust you.
 To be honest with you,
I think they're scared of you.
 I understand.
 You must be used
to that by now, huh ?
 I am a Jaffa.
 I have served
as a warrior for your enemy.
 I have carried
your enemy within me.
 Yeah.
 Well, that's
kind of a human thing.
 We tend to be afraid
of things we don't know.
 Why is O'Neill not afraid ?
 Teal'c, I saw you
stand up to a god.
 - You refused to kill.
I saw you make that decision.
- Yes.
 In that moment, I learned
everything I needed to know
to trust you.
 If I had killed you then,
I would not be here now.
 Neither would I.
 I will prove
my allegiance, O'Neill.
 Teal'c, I sure wish
you didn't have to.
 When I do,
 you will show me
this world.
 Oh, you bet.
 Just not all
at once, though.
 It's big.
 And these headaches,
Major.
 They started
when you came back
from your last mission ?
 Yeah.
They've been gettin' worse.
 Hmm.
Anybody else on the team
experienced these symptoms ?
 No.
Why ?
 It could be a reaction
to gate travel.
 [ Sighs ] Look, Doc,
just give me a horse pill
for the pain or something.
 It's a damn headache.
 What's this ?
 You didn't notice this ?
What ?
Notice what ?
 [ Squishing Sound ]
[ Screaming ]
 - [ Energy Swooshing ]
- Major !
 - [ Grunting ]
- [ Groaning,
Neck Cracking ]
 [ Man ]
So, the device should be
on every planet we find.
 I studied the one
on Abydos for months.
 It's sort of
like a-a--
Telephone.
 Telephone.
I like that.
 In order to get back home,
all you have to do is...
 dial Earth,
which is, uh--
 which is what we're here
to talk about, so--
 What is Major Kawalsky doing
in the embarkation room ?
 Page Colonel O'Neill
and General Hammond
to the embarkation room, now.
 [ Man ]
Yes, ma'am.
 Charlie ?
Major Kawalsky ?
 Jack ?
 What am I doing here ?
 Hey, we got a sick man here.
Where the hell is he ?
 Was the doctor
here before ?
I don't remember.
 Sorry, Dr. Nimziki
was supposed to be
on call.
 Dr. Warner, chief surgeon.
What's the problem ?
 Headache.
Little more than
a headache, Doc.
 He just had a blackout.
 Hmm.
We'll do an M.R.I.
right away.
 See what's
going on in there.
 Take care of him, Doc.
We need him.
 [ Hammond ]
Welcome, Teal'c.
This is Colonel Kennedy.
 I'm extraordinarily
pleased to meet you, sir.
 Colonel Kennedy's job
is to gather information,
 uh, knowledge,
about our potential enemies.
 I offer my knowledge
of the Goa'ulds.
 I offer my skills
as a warrior
in defeating them.
 I pledge my honor
and my life to this world.
 Well, thank you.
 [ Hammond ]
This is just
an informal meeting, son.
 Take a seat.
 Have a lot of questions
to ask, so if there are
no objections ?
 What can you tell us
about the power source
the Goa'ulds use...
 to power their weapons,
ships ?
 - Nothing.
- I see.
 Do you yourself have
an understanding of the physics
behind the Stargate ?
 - No.
- I see.
 Knowledge of Goa'uld magic
is forbidden.
 It's not magic, Teal'c.
They just want you
to think that.
 Permission
to barge in, sir ?
Colonel O'Neill.
 I was hoping to meet you.
 Your mission report
from Chulak...
 made for the most
engrossing analysis
of my career.
 Well, thanks.
What was your favorite part ?
 Perhaps now is not
the time, Colonel.
 General, you know
what I went and did ?
 I told Teal'c how we all
respect a person's rights
in this country.
 I assure you,
there's nothing untoward
taking place here, Colonel.
 Please.
Join us.
 - Thank you.
Hey, Teal'c.
- O'Neill.
 That's "Teal'c,"
with an apostrophe.
 "T-e-a-l-apostrophe-c."
 Colonel--
Yes, sir.
Very well,
 Teal'c,
what can you tell me
about the Goa'ulds ?
 They rule by force.
 Their numbers were very few,
but they are growing.
 How many worlds
do they control ?
 Many hundreds.
Perhaps more.
 And should we expect
to encounter these Goa'ulds
everywhere we go ?
 [ Teal'c ]
It is possible.
[ Whispering ] "We" ?
 But there are many more
worlds that the Goa'ulds
have no use for.
 On those worlds,
the people are abandoned,
and left to fend for themselves.
 Is there a leadership
or government with which
we could negotiate a peace ?
 Some, like Apophis,
are great kings,
 and rule over many worlds
as their gods.
 But they have
no need for peace.
 If they could kill you,
they would.
 Could they ?
They have spacecraft, right ?
 Yes. Without the Stargate,
such a journey would
take many months.
 Perhaps even years.
It would take many vessels,
many slave armies.
 We're not that much
of a nuisance just yet.
 These slaves--
Where do they come from ?
 There is a tale
of a primitive world the Goa'uld
discovered millennia ago,
 the Tauri,
first world where forms
of this type evolved.
 It is said the Goa'uld
harvested among the primitives.
 Some became Goa'uld hosts.
Others became Jaffa.
 The rest were taken as slaves,
and seeded among the stars
to serve them.
 But that world has been
lost for centuries.
 Teal'c,
beings of this form...
 evolved here on Earth.
 This world--
[ O'Neill ] ...is the world
you're talking about, Teal'c.
 Ra came here.
 If our ancestors
hadn't rebelled
and buried the Stargate--
 You would not have become
strong enough to challenge them.
 Then the galaxy
is populated by
the ancient peoples of Earth.
 -There could be millions by now.
-And you are
their greatest hope.
 And mine.
 [ Beeping, Whirring ]
 [ Tapping
Computer Keyboard ]
 I'm gonna drop by
the control room.
By the silence around here,
 it seems like the Goa'ulds
have finally given up.
 When was the last time
you slept ?
[ Chuckles ]
I don't know.
 Doesn't help
when the whole base
goes on alert every two hours.
 No, it's not that.
It's just that...
 my mind races,
and I can't stop
thinking about Sha're--
 where she is,
what she's become--
I know.
 But you can't
stay awake forever.
 I can try.
[ Chuckles ]
 You're right.
I'll meet you
at the next briefing.
 All right.
 [ Clicking,
Beeping, Whirring ]
 Major Kawalsky ?
We're all done here,
 but I'm taking you
off active duty
as of now.
 - Major ?
- [ Electrical Sizzling ]
 - [ Alarm Blaring ]
- Security to the Infirmary.
Security to the Infirmary.
 Set for Condition Red.
Set for Condition Red.
 [ Alarm Continues ]
 [ Grunting, Screaming ]
 [ Electronic Chirping ]
 Kawalsky, what the hell
are you doing ?
[ Grunts ]
 Close the blast doors !
 Emergency in the control room !
Emergency in the control room !
 [ Grunting ]
 [ Speaking In An Alien Voice ]
Help me.
 - Kawalsky !
- [ Carter Grunting ]
 [ Guns Clicking ]
[ O'Neill ]
Don't shoot !
 Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
 [ Alarm Continues ]
 [ Grunts ]
You know they won't let you
out of this mountain alive.
 When those doors open,
they'll shoot on sight.
You know that.
 [ Hammond ] What the--
Someone inside the elevator
hit the emergency stop.
 Get those doors open !
 Get 'em open.
It's about time.
Give me a hand here.
 Charlie, what
the hell's going on ?
 I don't have a clue, Colonel.
But she's hurt bad.
 We have to get her
to the Infirmary.
 The parasite's
wrapped around his spine.
 [ Medical Personnel
Chattering ]
 It's a--
 It's a Goa'uld.
Probably an infant.
 They think that the reason
it hasn't been able to take
you over completely is...
 it's not mature yet.
 - It's what's causing
your blackouts.
- What are you saying ?
 I got one of those
parasites in me ?
 Well, how in hell
does that happen ?
 We were kind of hoping
you could tell us.
You didn't feel it happening ?
 [ Scoffs ]
No.
 - When was the first time
you blacked out ?
- I was here.
 We'd just come back through,
from Chulak.
 I thought it was
just from coming back
through the Stargate.
 We were helping that kid.
Casey was his name.
 It was a-- a sharp--
 Oh, God, Jack. I thought
I wrenched my neck.
 Well, anyway, Casey,
he was all right.
 They took him out of there.
 Oh, God, Jack,
you gotta help me.
 You gotta get
this thing out of me.
 That's the plan.
 I've taken Major Kawalsky
off all pain medication
to increase his alertness.
 This should increase
his ability to resist--
When can you remove it ?
 It would be an extremely complex
operation. The parasite has
literally woven itself...
 around his nervous system.
Can it be done, or not ?
 Without killing him ?
Possibly.
 Without making him
a quadriplegic ?
That's a whole different story.
 You just tell me who you need
to assist, anyone in the world.
 I'll have them here
within 24 hours.
 Yes, sir.
 When I was out,
did I hurt anybody ?
 There's one man dead.
 A few more hurt.
[ Gasps ]
 Captain Carter's
going to be all right.
 I was just going to go
check on her, actually.
 Oh, I didn't mean to--
No.
 She doesn't blame you.
You're not responsible, Charlie.
It's not your fault.
 It's that damn thing
that's inside of you.
 Look, as soon as
they know how to do it,
they'll cut it out of you.
 - Right now,
you gotta fight it.
- [ Sighs Deeply ]
 I don't mind tellin' ya,
this is scaring me big-time.
 [ Kennedy ]
Teal'c, stand and face
this way, please ?
 What is the emergency ?
They would not tell me.
 That's none
of your concern now.
 Kawalsky's become infected
with a Goa'uld.
 - And you wish to see if I still
carry the Goa'uld within me.
- Yes, now. Please.
 [ Soft Growling ]
God, I hate
those things.
 [ Hissing ]
 You've seen enough ?
 - You understand, we had
to look and see this--
- What are its demands ?
 So far, it's only managed
to rear its butt-ugly head
whenever Kawalsky blacks out.
 But it's already
killed a man.
 Then there will be
a struggle
for the host body.
 It must have sought
a host in desperation
before it was mature.
 We intend to remove it
before that happens.
 It will kill the host
if you try.
 Once it is one with the host,
it is capable of killing him.
 So...
what do we do ?
 [ Screaming, Groaning ]
 [ O'Neill ]
Charlie, we got
General Hammond here.
 [ Moaning ]
General, please.
 You gotta tell 'em
to do something.
The pain is too much.
 We are, Major.
You just have to hold on.
 No, don't you give me
that good soldier crap.
 You order them to cut
this damn thing out of me.
 Teal'c says
if they do that,
you might die.
 I don't care !
 Look, Charlie,
they want to talk to it.
 What ?
What the hell is
there to talk about ?
 - We must offer it life
to save yours.
- No !
 - No, I want you to kill it !
- [ Beeping Faster, Louder ]
 - [ Teal'c ] We must talk
to the Goa'uld within you.
- Jack, please help me, Jack--
 Charlie, just let 'em
do their job !
 No, don't let them
do this, Jack !
I want you to kill it !
 - Kill it, Jack, kill it !
Kill it !
- His heart rate just doubled.
 Kill it, kill it, kill it !
Kill it, kill it--
[ Beeping Intensifies ]
 - [ Gagging ]
- [ Beeping Continues,
Louder And Faster ]
 - [ Beeping Stops ]
- [ Growls ]
 [ Speaking In Alien Voice ]
Name is Kree.
 - I won't speak to the traitor.
You are their leader ?
- I am.
 - Speak.
- I'm General George Hammond,
United States Air Force.
 Commander in Chief of the S.G.C.
And you are--
 Interested only in returning
through the Stargate. Now !
 You are in no position
to make demands.
I have a proposition.
 Release me now,
or I will destroy you.
 If you will leave this man's
body, we will allow you to live,
and send you back...
 through the Stargate
in your natural fo--
This body is mine !
 If you're
unwilling to leave, we will
be forced to surgically--
 Teal'c !
Hold him !
 Release me now,
or I will destroy you !
 - Do not attempt to escape !
- I command you !
 We will open fire !
Colonel, stand aside !
Release me now !
 - Take aim !
- [ Rifles Clicking ]
 - [ Speaking In Human Voice ]
Don't shoot !
- Don't shoot !
 Hold your fire.
[ Kawalsky Gasping ]
Oh ! Oh, God.
 [ Groaning ]
It's all right, son. I won't
put you through that again.
 Oh, Jack,
what did I do ?
Nothin'.
 Just got a little mouthy.
Nothing serious.
 Doctor Warner ?
I want to know the minute...
 that godforsaken thing can
be taken out of my officer,
is that clear ?
 Yes, sir.
This conversation is over.
 [ Beeping Continues ]
 As you were, people.
 In light of the day's events,
Colonel Kennedy has chosen...
 to make certain recommendations
to my superiors that I want
to share with all of you.
 Colonel Kennedy ?
I know that many of you
have served with Major Kawalsky,
 so please forgive me
if what I'm about to suggest
appears in any way callous,
 but I believe surgical
removal of the parasite
may be a mistake.
 General,
this is a waste of time
Kawalsky does not have.
 Doctor Warner, what are
Major Kawalsky's chances
of surviving the procedure ?
 Ten, twelve percent
at most.
And the parasite ?
 It is an intelligent being
after all, isn't it, Colonel ?
I read that in your report.
 The parasite itself would
not survive the procedure.
 So, we're faced with destroying
one life in the hopeless attempt
to save another.
 - You see the ethical dilemma.
- No, I don't.
 My team and I
are completely prepared
to perform the procedure, sir.
 [ Warner ] We'll do our best.
[ Kennedy ]
Of course you will, doctor.
 Please don't misunderstand.
We all wish
the invading parasite...
 in Major Kawalsky's body
could be safely removed.
 But the facts
are the facts.
 - What was your point ?
- If we proceed
with this operation,
 Major Kawalsky
will have died in vain.
 - And if we don't ?
- Well, let's consider that
for a moment.
 These infant Goa'ulds--
 If they're so young, so fragile
in their larval state,
 that they require a, uh--
I'm sorry, what is it
you called yourself ?
 - Jaffa.
- For want of
a better translation, what ?
 Incubator ?
How is it that
they're so intelligent ?
 A Goa'uld is born with
the knowledge of all Goa'ulds
that came before it.
 Genetic memory.
That's amazing.
 Yes, it is:
all the knowledge
of the goa'ulds.
 I just want you all
to think on that before
we just throw it away.
 I've thought about it.
You thought about it ?
I think we've all thought--
 - Any more thinking to be done ?
- Colonel--
 Imagine if we could
convince this goa'uld
to share that knowledge.
 A Goa'uld would not
willingly share.
No, Teal'c is right.
 To them, we're nothing.
Less than nothing.
 I mean, think about it:
they've taken on the roles
of our ancient gods.
 - What does that tell you ?
- [ Kennedy ] All right.
What if we just studied it ?
 How much could we learn
from that ? What if
we faced up to the fact...
 of Major Kawalsky's
slim chances of survival,
 and realized that
the greatest enemy
mankind may ever face...
 has just been delivered
right to our doorstep.
 Even if we let it return
through the Stargate
as a gesture of good faith,
 - how much could we--
- Just what kind of an officer
are you, Colonel ?
 - Sir ?
- As long as there is
a snowball's chance in hell...
 that my officer will come out
of this procedure alive,
we'll go ahead with it.
 With respect, General,
I feel I should take this
to my superiors.
 [ Scoffs ]
Well, me, I'll probably
just call the president,
 and get approval right
from the horse's mouth.
 But sure,
you go right ahead, Colonel.
Talk to your superiors.
 In the meantime, people,
let's get the job done.
 [ Screeching ]
 Do you have any sense
that the new anesthetic...
 is working better than
the last one we tried ?
 Yes.
But you're not sure ?
 There's no communication
at all between
you and the symbiote ?
 A Jaffa does not communicate
with the Goa'uld it carries.
 Well, keep
your fingers crossed.
 Uh, nurse,
you can stop this I.V.
and release the patient.
 We'll go with this one.
 They're gettin' ready.
 It's about time.
 How's the pain ?
 Maybe I'm just
getting used to it.
 Listen, Jack,
if this doesn't work--
Hey, come on.
 It's a cakewalk.
 It hurts to talk.
Will you shut up
for a second ?
 I want to be cremated.
 I don't want there
to be anything left
of that thing inside me.
 You make sure,
all right ?
 Can we not talk about this ?
When am I gonna
talk about it, Jack ?
 This could be
my last conversation.
Aw, for cryin' out loud.
 It's not
your last conversation.
 Hey, I spoke to the doc.
He told me the odds.
 Don't give me any crap.
 Okay.
It's our last conversation.
 You'll be off on some
other planet, anyway.
 Yeah. P3A-575--
 Whatever.
Whatever.
 This was gonna be
my first real command.
 I was
looking forward to it.
You still can, Charlie.
 [ Scoffs ]
They got me
all tied up here.
 Give me your hand.
 I want you to know,
no matter what happens,
 it was an honor
to serve with you, sir.
 Listen, um--
 I gotta ask you something.
It's not easy for me.
 We're friends.
 If you don't make it,
 can I have your stereo ?
 [ Laughs, Coughs ]
 - What ?
- [ Coughing Continues ]
 It hurts to laugh.
 [ Sighs ]
You all right ?
 Oh, never better.
 [ Warner ]
I've held back
on the use of anesthetic...
 until it can be
administered to both patient
and creature simultaneously.
 Major Kawalsky,
we're going to begin
the operation.
 Are you ready ?
 I want to say something.
General Hammond, sir ?
 [ Hammond Over P.A. ]
I'm here, son.
 [ Kawalsky ]
If this doesn't work,
 I want you
to give the order.
 I want to wake up as me
or not at all.
 [ Microphone Feedback
Squealing ]
You have my word, son.
 [ Nurse ]
Scalpel.
 Injecting anesthetic.
 [ Warner ]
All right.
Start the clock.
 I'm making
the first incision.
 I'm separating
the primary ganglia...
 attaching the parasite
to the spinal cord... now.
 It's coming away
more easily than I'd hoped.
 Must be the anesthetic.
 At least
it's going well.
That's fantastic.
 If we can reverse
what's happened
to the Major,
 then there's still
a chance for Sha're.
 Let's hope.
 The ganglia are
still constricting...
 periodically.
 Obviously, there still
seems to be some...
 sign of life
in this symbiote.
 I don't know how.
Scissors.
 [ Nurse ]
Scissors.
 There are thin filaments
extending up...
 and into the brain.
 I'm going to sever them.
 [ Faint Tearing Sound ]
 - [ Beeping, Faster ]
- [ Warner ] Hold him still !
 What's happening ?
 I don't know, sir.
I don't think it was
anything I did.
 I'd like to proceed.
 - How much longer ?
- Almost there.
 Almost.
Large clamp.
 Large clamp.
 [ Tearing,
Sucking Sound ]
 I'm...
taking it out--
 Now.
 [ Squishing ]
 I think we did it.
 - [ Warner ] Close for me.
- Well done, everyone.
 [ O'Neill ]
That's right, Dorothy.
It was all a dream.
 Can you move your fingers ?
 Toes ?
 Hey !
[ Chuckles ]
Congratulations, Major.
 You've already exceeded
my wildest expectations.
 [ Chuckles ]
 Thirsty.
 Here.
 [ Coughs ]
Easy, big fella.
 You're not drinking
for two anymore.
 [ Sighs ]
I made it.
 See ?
Told ya.
Piece of cake.
 I heard
the operation was
a complete success, sir.
 Congratulations.
And I have my orders
to return to Langley.
 - Don't let the door
hit your ass on the way out.
- With Teal'c, sir.
 I have his
travel orders as well.
 You do realize that
without his cooperation
in finding an anesthetic,
 the operation
might have been a failure.
 - I think we owe him
something for that.
- Unfortunately, Teal'c...
 is now carrying
the only living Goa'uld
available for study.
 And we do need
to study it, sir,
make no mistake on that.
 These aliens are
possibly the greatest threat
this country has ever kno--
 I'm well aware
of the threat, Colonel.
This facility is the front line.
 It's the reason
this command exists.
 We just go about things
differently around here.
 I see.
Well--
 I'll make
the transport arrangements
in the morning.
 You do that.
 Anyway, Colonel Kennedy's
probably going to want
to take it with him.
 So, if you want
to see it once before he--
 Are you talking about
that thing in my head ?
 Daniel thinks it's fascinating.
No, I just thought
you might want to see it.
 No. Thanks.
 Hey, I just heard.
They're shipping Teal'c
out to Langley.
 Kennedy's taking him
with him.
What ?
What for ?
 "Study."
That's Kennedy's word.
 Right. Like
a damn lab rat ?
 Apparently, Kennedy's
ethics are selective.
 Listen, in case the Colonel
can't talk him out of it,
 I'd like a minute
alone with Teal'c
before they ship him out.
 He helped
get me through this.
 I gotta thank him.
Okay. I think that
can be arranged.
 Hey.
Come on over here.
 I want
to shake hands with the man
who helped save my life.
 I'd like a minute alone
with my friend.
 I'll make it an order.
Does that make you feel better ?
 - [ Electrical Sizzling ]
- [ Grunting ]
 [ Speaking In Alien Voice ]
Jaffa ! What they removed
was merely a dead husk.
 I had already become one
with the host.
 I give you this chance.
Serve me, and you may live.
 [ Choking ]
I... will... not.
 - Then die !
- [ Choking ]
 Colonel, I'm doing
everything I can.
So, because he wasn't born...
 on this particular planet,
he doesn't have any rights
anymore, is that it ?
 Get out !
 Major--
[ Screams ]
 What happened ?
 The Goa'uld has won.
It's taken control of him.
 But how ?
It deceived us.
 [ Rumbling, Banging ]
[ Typing ]
 [ Groaning ]
 [ Countdown Beeping ]
 Jaffa !
Kal sha.
 You can not pass.
 What ?
He set the coordinates
for Chulak.
 [ Roaring ]
 [ Grunting, Roaring ]
 [ Hammond ]
He set the autodestruct sequence
on the fail-safe device.
 How did he
have the code ?
I don't know,
 but I need
two ranking officers
to override, and you're it !
 All right, that did it.
Open the blast doors.
 Teal'c !
 Hold him there !
 [ Grunting, Groaning ]
 Shut it down !
 Now !
 He was your friend.
 My friend
died on the table.
 If anything, the fact
that he knew how to set
the autodestruct code...
 proves that there's hope
for Sha're and Skaara.
 How ?
Because only Kawalsky
could have known that code.
 So, something of the host
must survive.
 Oh, absolutely.
That's good to hear.
 Oh, anytime, sir.
You just come on down.
We'd be glad to have you.
 [ Chuckles ]
Well, hell, sir.
He's right here.
 Why don't you
tell him yourself ?
 I'm sure he'd like
to hear from you.
 [ Sighs ]
Yes, Mr. President ?
 Yes, sir.
 Colonel O'Neill,
is SG-1 ready to ship out ?
We are, sir.
 Then you have a go for
a standard recon mission
on P3-575.
 Yes, sir.
 Reporting as ordered.
 "Sir."
[ Whispers ]
"Sir."
 Sir.
Welcome aboard,
son.
 [ Carter ]
The map reports conditions
on the planet are favorable.
 Well--
