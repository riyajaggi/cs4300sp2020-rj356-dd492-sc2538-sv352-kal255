 [ Hammond ] DR. JACKSON, I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE COME UP WITH... SOME NEW THEORY ABOUT THE STARGATE. UH, YES, SIR. OKAY, UH-- IF YOU STUDY MYTHS WORLDWIDE, IT LOOKS AS IF... THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF STAR GODS: THE TYRANTS, WHO TREATED THEIR SUBJECTS LIKE CATTLE, DEMANDED ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE, UTILIZED THEIR TECHNOLOGY TO PUNISH AND CONTROL. AS IN THE GOA'ULD. AND THE CULTURE BEARERS, WHO USED KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY TO BENEFIT HUMANS.

 SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE GOA'ULDS WEREN'T THE ONLY ALIENS TO VISIT EARTH. WELL, HOW DOES THAT AFFECT US TODAY ? WE DON'T THINK THE GOA'ULD BUILT THE STARGATE SYSTEM. BEING PARASITIC BY NATURE, THEY JUST USED IT TO BECOME A DOMINATE RACE IN THE GALAXY. BUT SOME OF THE GOOD GODS WHO LIKED HUMANS MIGHT HAVE USED IT TOO, AND THEY COULD STILL BE OUT THERE. - ANY INDICATIONS  OF WHO THEY ARE ? - YES, SIR. THE VIKINGS. NOW, IN NORSE MYTHOLOGY THE GODS WERE POWERFUL WARRIORS. LEGEND TELLS US THAT THE GOD THOR WAS A FRIEND TO HUMANS... AND PROTECTED THEM FROM THE ETINS, BEINGS OF GREAT POWER AND KNOWLEDGE WHO WERE ENEMIES OF MANKIND. HE USED A WEAPON CALLED "THOR'S HAMMER." NOW, WHEN THOR HURLED THE HAMMER, IT SUPPOSEDLY PRODUCED THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.

 THAT COULD INDICATE SOME SORT OF ADVANCED TYPE OF ENERGY WEAPON. UH, SIR ? I THINK WHAT DANIEL'S TRYING TO SAY IS IF THERE IS A BUNCH OF ALIENS OUT THERE... WHO ARE HOSTILE TO THE GOA'ULDS, AND HAVE EQUAL OR SUPERIOR FIREPOWER, WE OUGHTA LOOK THEM UP. - THEY COULD BECOME ALLIES. - I HAVE SEEN THE HAMMER SIGN  BEFORE. IT IS THE SYMBOL OF A WORLD CALLED CIMMERIA. ALL JAFFA ARE TAUGHT THE SEQUENCE OF STARGATE SYMBOLS TO THAT WORLD. - WHY IS THAT, TEAL'C ? - TO ENSURE THAT NO GOA'ULD  GOES THERE. IT IS FORBIDDEN. SOMETHING TRANSPIRED ON CIMMERIA THAT NO GOA'ULD WILL SPEAK OF. WELL, I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. SO DO I, COLONEL. ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE A GOAL. COLONEL, WE'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE THIS ALONG WITH YOU. IT'S A GIFT. GEE, SIR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. FOR THE ALIEN FRIENDLIES IN THE EVENT YOU SUCCEED IN YOUR MISSION AND MAKE CONTACT. OH, YOU HAD IT MADE. IT'S GREAT. WE ASKED THE SAGAN INSTITUTE TO IMAGINE A SORT OF GREETING FROM EARTH, IF THEY COULD SOMEHOW HYPOTHETICALLY GET IT TO A DISTANT WORLD. IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO WE ARE. IT EXPLAINS VARIOUS EARTH CULTURES, RELIGIONS, HISTORIES. [ Female On P.A. ] CHEVRON ONE ENCODED. CHEVRON TWO ENCODED. TIME TO GO TO WORK. [ Laughter ] - THIS IS... DIFFERENT. - DANIEL, YOU'RE ON. [ Man ] THOR ! [ All Chanting ] THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR !  THOR ! THOR ! [ Electronic Hum ] THOR ! THOR !  THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BUILDING UP SOME KIND OF CHARGE. - THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! - DANIEL, DIAL HOME.  WE'RE GOING BACK NOW. WHY ? JUST DO IT. IT'S AN ORDER. - THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! - [ Electronic Humming ] THOR ! THOR ! THOR !  THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR !  THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! THOR ! [ Chanting Continues ] TEAL'C, GET OUT OF THERE ! [ Screaming ] I THINK THAT THIS IS THOR'S HAMMER. I-I--  I THINK THEY'RE DEAD. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT. YOU SAID THOR LIKED HUMANS. THAT HE USED HIS WEAPON TO PROTECT THEM. WE GO BACK, WE BRING ANOTHER S.G. TEAM THROUGH AND WE START A SEARCH. [ Horse Whinnies ] WAIT. YOU'RE A LITTLE SHORT FOR GODS. BUT YOU CAME THROUGH THE PORTAL UNHARMED ? SO YOU MUST BE FROM THRUDVANG, THOR'S HOME IN THE STARS. HAIL AND WELCOME. ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT, UH-- I'M CAPTAIN SAMANTHA CARTER. THIS IS DANIEL JACKSON. MY NAME IS GAIRWYN. I'M MISTRESS HERE. MY HUSBAND IS GONE A-VIKING. UM, TRADING, FIGHTING. [ Scoffs ] THAT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS. NOWADAYS, THEY GO TO THE TOWNS TO LOOK FOR WORK. IT'S BEEN A HARD SEASON FOR FARMERS. WATER FROM THE MOUNTAINS IS SCARCE, BUT YOU'RE WELCOME AT MY TABLE. - THANK YOU. - YEAH, THANKS, BUT WE HAVE  A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. TWO OF THE MEN WHO CAME THROUGH THE PORTAL WITH US, THEY'RE GONE. YES. I HEARD THERE WERE TWO ETINS IN YOUR COMPANY. - ETINS ? - GOA'ULDS ? YOU THINK THAT  TEAL'C AND JACK ARE GOA'ULDS ? YOU TRICKED THEM HERE TO BE RID OF THEM, YES ? NO, THEY'RE FRIENDS. AND IF THEY'RE ALIVE, WE NEED TO FIND THEM. YOU'RE HUMANS, LIKE US. YES ! YOU AND I MAY EVEN HAVE SOME OF THE SAME ANCESTORS. WE CAME HERE FROM A DIFFERENT WORLD, FROM EARTH. MIDGARDR. THEN WE ARE YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS. MIDGARDR IS THE ANCIENT HOME. THOR BROUGHT OUR PEOPLE HERE AND MADE THIS TO KEEP US SAFE. DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS ? ARE THEY DEAD ? THAT'S A MAGIC BEYOND OUR KEN. IT'S SAID THAT THOR WILL COME BACK ONE DAY AND TEACH US WHEN WE ARE OLDER. - WOULD THOR KILL A HUMAN BEING  IN ORDER TO KILL AN ETIN ? - NEVER. OUR GODS ARE GREAT AND POWERFUL WARRIORS, BUT THEY ARE JUST AND TRUE. - SO THEY MAY BE ALIVE ? - IS THERE ANYONE WHO MIGHT KNOW  WHERE THEY ARE ? ONLY ONE. WE CALL HER KENDRA. TEN SEASONS AGO, SHE WALKED THROUGH THE PORTAL AND WAS TAKEN. TAKEN ? WHERE ? THAT WINTER SOME HUNTERS FOUND HER HALF-FROZEN IN THE MOUNTAINS. MAYBE THE BEAM TRANSPORTED THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET. DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND THIS KENDRA ? SHE LIVES BY HERSELF. I TAKE HER THINGS NOW AND THEN. WE CAN'T SPARE THE HORSES, BUT I CAN TAKE YOU THERE ON FOOT. ABSOLUTELY. PLEASE. THIS WAY. TEAL'C ? [ Squealing ] IS JUNIOR OKAY ? YES. BUT THE BEAM CAUSED THE GOA'ULD I CARRY GREAT PAIN. [ Squealing Continues ] I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. [ Electronic Buzz,  Indistinct ] WHOA ! HELLO. I AM THOR, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ASGARD FLEET. THE HIGH COUNCIL OF ASGARD HAS DESIGNATED CIMMERIA... A SAFE WORLD FOR DEVELOPING SENTIENT SPECIES... BY UNANIMOUS DECREE, ERA 40.73.29. THE GOA'ULD SYSTEM LORDS WERE SO INFORMED. AH. WE'RE NOT GOA'ULDS. HE CARRIES ONE AROUND IN HIM, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE IN THE MATTER. YOU WERE WARNED NOT TO COME HERE UNDER PAIN OF DEATH. LOOK, I'M COLONEL JACK O'NEILL FROM EARTH. I HAPPEN TO KNOW YOU'VE SPENT SOME TIME THERE IN OUR PAST-- FOR CRIMES AGAINST THE LIVING HOST... AND ALL THOSE YOU HAVE MURDERED AND ENSLAVED, THE SENTENCE IS DEATH. LOOK, UM, WE CAME HERE TO SEE YOU. THIS IS YOUR PRISON. YOUR TECHNOLOGY WILL NOT FUNCTION HERE. THERE ARE NO LUXURIES, NO WORSHIPPERS. - NO SLAVES TO DO YOUR BIDDING. - TEAL'C, I THINK WE JUST  GOT THE ANSWERING MACHINE. ONLY BASIC SUSTENANCE AND TIME. YEAH, WELL, GREAT. THANKS FOR THE CHAT. WE SHOULD HEAR THE REMAINDER OF THE MESSAGE. WHEN YOU TIRE OF THIS EXISTENCE, GO TO THE HALL OF MJOLLNIR... AND FACE THE HAMMER. THERE IS NO ESCAPE. ONLY THE HOST CAN LEAVE THIS PLACE ALIVE. - GOA'ULD TRAP ? - SO IT WOULD SEEM. IF I ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THIS PLACE, THE GOA'ULD I CARRY WILL BE DESTROYED. BY A HAMMER. YOU MUST LEAVE WITHOUT ME. IF I STAY, I WILL REMAIN SAFE. JUST RELAX, TEAL'C. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. LET'S JUST FIND THIS... HALL OF "MOHAIR," WHATEVER IT'S CALLED. - NO ! - SHH ! IT'S ALL RIGHT. RUNE LIGHT FLOW... IN MIGHT AND MAIN. KNIT THE BONES AND TAKE THE PAIN. NOW, THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO FIGHT, CHOOSE A BOY YOUR OWN SIZE. GAIRWYN, MY FRIEND. HAIL AND WELCOME. THIS IS CARTER AND DANIEL. - HAIL. - HI-- HAIL. THEY CAME THROUGH THE PORTAL FROM MIDGARDR, THE FIRST HOME. THEY NEED YOUR HELP. - WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT BOY ? - HE HAD A BROKEN WRIST.  I HEALED IT. THEN WHY DID HE RUN AWAY ? BECAUSE OF THIS. IT IS THE MARK OF WHAT IUSEDTO BE. WHEN A GOA'ULD TAKES OVER A HUMAN HOST, IT'S PERMANENT. NOT HERE. THOR'S HAMMER DROVE IT FROM MY BODY AND RESTORED ME TO MY TRUE SELF. -THE "IT", YOU MEAN THE PARASITE  THAT WAS INSIDE OF YOU-- -IS GONE. MY GOD. THOR'S HAMMER, THE STONE BY THE GATE ? NO. THE HAMMER IS DEEP UNDERGROUND INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN. AS LONG AS I HAVE KNOWN HER, KENDRA HAS HARMED NO ONE. MY WIFE, SHA'RE, IS NOW AS YOU ONCE WERE. SHE HAS BEEN TAKEN BY A GOA'ULD AND-- - IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  IS TRUE-- - IT IS TRUE. - THEN HELP US. - HELP US TO FIND OUR FRIENDS. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESCUE ME FROM THE BEAM. IF YOU HAD NOT DONE SO, YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE NOW. AH, YOU'D HAVE DONE THE SAME FOR ME. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND ME WALKING AROUND WITH ONE OF THOSE GOA'ULD LARVA IN MY GUT, BUT, HEY. OUCH. THESE GOA'ULDS DIED WITH THEIR HUMAN HOSTS. THE MARKS ON THESE BONES, THEY ARE FROM A CUTTING INSTRUMENT, BUT NOT METAL. - WHAT THEN ? - I BELIEVE THEY WERE MADE  BY LARGE, POWERFUL TEETH. THESE BODIES DID NOT DIE OF NATURAL CAUSES. THEY WERE KILLED AND THEN EATEN. WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS SOME WILD ANIMAL FOUND ITS WAY IN. THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY OUT. WE FIND IT, WE'RE GONE. I CALL IT THE LABYRINTH. IT IS THE PLACE WHERE THE GOA'ULDS ARE DESTROYED. HOW IS IT DONE ? DID YOU FEEL IT ? YES. AND WAS IT PAINFUL ? IT WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE SUFFERING I WATCHED MYSELF INFLICT ON OTHERS. FOR ALL THOSE YEARS... SO MANY. YOUR HUMAN FRIEND, O'NEILL, HE CAN WALK OUT UNHARMED. ALL YOU NEED DO IS WAIT. TEAL'C IS OUR FRIEND TOO. HE'S JAFFA, NOT GOA'ULD. JAFFA ? A FRIEND ? THEY ARE AS GUILTY AS THOSE THEY SERVE. THIS JAFFA GAVE UP HIS RANK, LEFT HIS HOME, SO HE COULD JOIN US AND FIGHT THE GOA'ULD. HIS DREAM IS TO SEE HIS PEOPLE FREE. IF THE GOA'ULD LARVA WITHIN HIM IS REMOVED, HE WILL DIE. YOU SEE, ONCE A JAFFA CARRIES A LARVA, IT ACTS AS HIS IMMUNE SYSTEM. I KNOW ALL I WANT TO KNOW OF JAFFA. ALL RIGHT. IF THE HAMMER DRIVES THE GOA'ULD FROM HIM AND HE DIES, SO BE IT. IT IS HIS PENANCE FOR SERVING THE GOA'ULD. TEAL'C WAS IN THE SERVICE OF APOPHIS, BUT HE SAVED OUR LIVES AND HELPED US ESCAPE. HE IS ONE OF US NOW. [ Thunder Rolling ] DID I ASK YOUR COUNSEL ? THE VALKYRIE RIDE THE WIND. THEY WANT ME TO HELP YOU. THEY SAY YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH. THEY TELL ME... THAT I MUST TAKE YOU THERE. THIS IS RIGHT. GO WITH THOR, MY FRIEND. I WILL TAKE YOU. BUT FIRST, I MUST CONSULT THE RUNES. TEAL'C, TAKE A SHOT AT THAT LAMP WITH YOUR STAFF WEAPON. [ Clicks ] IT WILL NOT FUNCTION. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID WOULD HAPPEN AS LONG AS WE'RE IN HERE. [ Teal'c ] THIS RACE MAY HAVE CONSIDERED PROJECTILE WEAPONS... TOO PRIMITIVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. [ Growling ] YEAH. HERE. THE MESSAGE SAID ONLY THE HOST COULD LEAVE THIS PLACE ALIVE. RIGHT. PERHAPS THIS COULD BE OF SOME BENEFIT TO THE BOY WHO WAS YOUR FRIEND. SKAARA. YEAH, I THOUGHT OF THAT. AND THE WIFE OF DANIEL JACKSON. PERHAPS IF THEY COULD BE BROUGHT HERE, THE GOA'ULD WHO TOOK THEM AS HOSTS COULD BE PURGED. YEAH, MAYBE. [ Water Sloshing ] WHAT IS IT, O'NEILL ? NOTHING. NEVER MIND. MIGHTY THOR, GOD OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING, WIELD YOUR HAMMER AND PROTECT ME. NOW YOU MUST SIT IN THE CIRCLE AND WAIT WITH ME. FOR WHAT ? A SIGN FROM THOR HIMSELF. GREAT, ANOTHER SIGN. SHE'S PROBABLY AFRAID TO GO BACK THERE. MAYBE IF WE OFFER HER SOME MORAL SUPPORT. HOW MUCH DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR LIFE BEFORE ? MUCH. I WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHILD. [ Carter ] IS THAT BAD ? ON JEBANNA, BEAUTY IS A CURSE. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND. - BECAUSE THE GOA'ULD  WANT PERFECT HOSTS ? YES. WHAT HAPPENED ? MARDUK DISCOVERED OUR SECRET AND RAIDED THE TEMPLE WHERE THEY TRIED TO HIDE ME. I'M SORRY. BECAUSE OF MY TRAINING IN THE TEMPLE, THE GOA'ULD, WHO TOOK POSSESSION OF MY BODY... COULD NOT TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER MY MIND. A PART OF ME, MYSELF, REMAINED. SOMETHING OF THE HOST SURVIVES. HOW DID YOU END UP HERE ? TEAL'C SAID THE GOA'ULD MADE THIS A FORBIDDEN PLANET AGES AGO. AND SO IT IS. BUT I KNEW MY BEAST. SHE HUNGERED FOR CONQUEST. SO I BECAME A VOICE WITHIN. I TAUNTED HER, AND WHISPERED OF RUMORS THAT... CIMMERIA MUST HOLD A WEALTH OF RICHES FOR ONE BOLD ENOUGH TO TAKE IT. YOU ACTUALLY INFLUENCED THE GOA'ULD THAT HAD TAKEN YOU OVER ? YES. SHE CAME TO CIMMERIA. AND I HOPED ONLY FOR A QUICK DEATH. ESCAPE. BUT WE WERE TAKEN INTO THE LABYRINTH, A DARK AND TERRIFYING PLACE. UNTIL THOR'S HAMMER... SET ME FREE. AND I HAVE HONORED HIS WAYS AND HIS PEOPLE EVER SINCE. [ Thunder Rolling ] IT IS A SIGN FROM THOR. NOW WE CAN GO. WATER. GIVE IT ENOUGH TIME, IT'LL BRING DOWN WALLS. EVEN WALLS JUST LIKE THAT. SO IN A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS, WE'LL BE FREE. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ? JAFFA, I AM UNAS, THE FIRST ONE. YOU DO NOT EXIST. KILL THE HUMAN. EXCUSE ME ? AND WE WILL FEAST... TOGETHER. I NO LONGER SERVE THE GOA'ULD. [ Growls ] WE SHALL SEE. - AH, JUST STAY PUT RIGHT THERE. - WEAPONS ARE OF NO USE HERE ! [ Groaning ] THE FIRST ONE, HE'S DEAD. YEAH ? WELL, THAT'S FINE BY ME. C'MON. [ Growling ] WHAT ? TEAL'C, WILL YOU RELAX ? THAT THING'S DEAD, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD. I BELIEVE  I HEARD A SOUND. WELL, THERE WOULDN'T BE TWO OF THOSE THINGS IN HERE. WOULD THERE ? IF THERE WERE, THEY WOULD SURELY BATTLE TO THE DEATH. SO WHAT'D YOU MEAN WHEN YOU TOLD THAT THING IT DIDN'T EXIST ? UNAS IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST HOST, BORN OF THE SAME PRIMORDIAL WATERS AS THE GOA'ULD. IT BECAME A MYTH, MUCH LIKE YOUR VAMPIRE. THAT THING WAS A GOA'ULD ? YES. I THOUGHT THEY PREFERRED HUMAN HOSTS. THERE ARE OTHER SPECIES FAR OLDER THAT HAVE BEEN USED AS HOSTS. SOME OF IMMEASURABLE POWER AND SAVAGERY. YEAH, WELL, I WONDER HOW LONG IT'S BEEN TRAPPED DOWN HERE. PERHAPS 1,000 YEARS. UNAS CAN UTILIZE LONG PERIODS OF SLEEP TO SURVIVE. IT IS DEAD, RIGHT ? WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK... AND DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH ITS CHEST OR ANYTHING-- THE OLD STORIES SAY UNAS HAD GREAT REGENERATIVE POWERS. BUT THOSE ARE TALES TOLD TO FRIGHTEN CHILDREN. IT IS A MYTH. IT WAS DEAD. THAT'S GOOD. I BELIEVE. YOUBELIEVE ? I AM CERTAIN. POSITIVE ? I AM. JUST A MYTH ? A MYTH. GOOD. WE'RE NOT LOST. ARE WE ? IT WAS LONG AGO. IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW. IT ALL LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW. KENDRA-- IT'S ALL RIGHT. JUST TAKE YOUR TIME. KENDRA, WHEN THE GOA'ULD WAS DESTROYED WITHIN YOU, WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE EXACTLY ? YOUR WIFE ? I HAVE TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY HOPE. IT WAS VERY PAINFUL. LIKE NEEDLES STABBING INSIDE THE HEAD. THE BEAST WILL DO ANYTHING TO STAY IN CONTROL. IT'S A BATTLE OF WILLS. MANY GIVE UP. WELL, SHA'RE WASN'T TRAINED IN A TEMPLE, LIKE YOU. BUT SHE HAD A SPIRIT. SHE WAS A FIGHTER. YOU LOVED HER VERY MUCH. I STILL DO.  I DREAM ABOUT HER. IT'S AS IF SOME PART OF HER IS REACHING OUT TO ME. MAYBE THAT'S JUST WISHFUL THINKING. I DON'T KNOW. NO. YOU STILL ARE CONNECTED. IF YOU FIND HER AND BRING HER HERE, I BELIEVE THERE IS HOPE. THANK YOU. I'M SURE NOW. THIS IS THE WAY. [ Groaning ] [ Growling ] OKAY. THAT'S NO MYTH. [ Growling Continues ] GAIRWYN TOLD ME THOR BUILD THIS CENTURIES AGO. IT BRINGS THE WATER FROM THE MOUNTAIN TO HIS PEOPLE IN THE TOWNS. THOR IS GENEROUS. YES. THIS MEANS WE ARE CLOSE. DANIEL, SHE SAID THAT HOURS AGO. NOW, EITHER SHE'S LOST AND DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT IT-- I DON'T THINK THAT SHE WOULD MISLEAD US. MAYBE IT'S NOT ON PURPOSE.  MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS. WHAT SHE SUFFERED ON HER WORLD, AND WHILE BEING A GOA'ULD... WOULD TRANSLATE ANYWHERE AS INCREDIBLE ABUSE. DOESN'T THE FACT THAT SHE INTERPRETED THOSE GUSTS OF WIND AS SIGNS MEAN SOMETHING ? PART OF HER WANTS TO FACE IT ALL AGAIN, AND ANOTHER PART DOESN'T. IT LOOKS LIKE THE PART THAT DOESN'T IS WINNING. WE'RE WASTING VALUABLE TIME HERE. GAIRWYN SAID THAT HUNTERS FOUND HER. WELL, HUNTERS DON'T NECESSARILY TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT LINE. THEY FOLLOW GAME. THEY WOULD NOT RISK HUNGER JUST TO GET HER BACK A DAY SOONER. DANIEL, YOUR BELIEF THAT KENDRA CAN SOMEHOW... HELP BRING SHA'RE BACK TO YOU-- IT DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE, AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE HER RELIABLE ! HAVEN'T YOU EVER HAD A FEELING... THAT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL SENSE AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT ? [ Kendra ] THIS WAY ! YOU SURE WE DIDN'T COME THIS WAY BEFORE ? WE HAVE NOT. IT LOOKS AWFULLY FAMILIAR. [ Unas ] YOUR WEAPONS CANNOT KILL ME ! I KNOW THE SECRETS OF THE LABYRINTH. - I COULD HELP YOU ESCAPE. - A MAP WOULD BE NICE. C'MON. [ Groans ] THERE. THE HAMMER. YES, THIS IS WHERE I CAME OUT. OKAY, GOOD. WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THE LABYRINTH ? IT'S DIFFICULT. MY BEAST WANDERED FORWARD AND BACK MANY TIMES. I DO REMEMBER THE PLACE OF ENTRANCE WHERE THOR SPEAKS TO THE GOA'ULDS. -THORIS INSIDE ? - HE SEEMS TO BE. BUT HE SPEAKS THE SAME MESSAGE AGAIN AND AGAIN. MY BEAST BELIEVED HE WAS NOT REAL. THERE WERE LONG TUNNELS... LEADING FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER. AND... SOMETHING ELSE IN THERE. -SOMETHING... ALIVE. - WHAT ? I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. OKAY ? [ Thunder Rolling ] THOR ASKS THAT I TRY. YEAH, THIS IS IT ! WE'RE OUTTA HERE. LET'S GO ! - [ Screaming ] - TEAL'C, GET OUTTA THERE ! THANK YOU, O'NEILL. YEAH. [ Unas Growling ] IF I AM TO DIE, IT WILL BE AS A WARRIOR... FACING MY ENEMY. LAST MAG. HELL, WHY NOT ? [ Growling Continues ] [ Carter ] IT'S OKAY. STAY HERE. YOU'VE DONE MORE THAN ENOUGH, REALLY. IN THE TEMPLE, WE WERE TAUGHT THAT FEAR IS THE GREATEST ENEMY. I MUST FACE MY FEAR. ARE YOU CONSIDERING THE SAME TACTIC AS I ? THE CLICHE IS, "ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING." THE ANSWER IS YES. HUMAN, YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF. WHY DO YOU STAY ? JAFFA, WHY DO YOU ALLY YOURSELF... WITH A SLAVE ? ONCE, THE GOA'ULD WERE ALL AS UNAS. WE WERE FEW, BUT WE RULED MILLIONS ! WE FED UPON THE WEAK... TO KEEP OURSELVES STRONG. I WILL TAKE PLEASURE... IN KILLING AND DEVOURING YOU BOTH. [ Growling ] GUNFIRE. THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. IT'S STILL ALIVE. SO CLOSE. FEEL AROUND THE DOOR. SEE IF THERE'S A TRIGGER SOMEWHERE. [ Groaning ] THERE'S ONE MORE THING I CAN TRY. I LEARNED THIS FROM THE SONGS OF THOR'S PEOPLE. CARVE THE RUNE FLOW. READ THE MIGHT. SEE THE RAINBOW. TEST THE WIGHT. [ Loud Bang, Indistinct ] - TEAL'C ! - THERE IS NO OTHER WAY. [ Growling ] WITHOUT THE HEALING POWER OF THE GOA'ULD, THIS BODY WILL NO LONGER REGENERATE. THERE IS TOO MUCH DAMAGE. NOW I SEE WHY THEY CALL YOU FRIEND. THIS IS KENDRA. SHE BROUGHT US HERE. SHE HAD FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE.  SHE WAS A GOA'ULD. THE HAMMER WORKS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS ? IT'S THE ONLY WAY OUTTA HERE, DANIEL. BUT WHAT THIS THING CAN DO FOR SHA'RE AND SKAARA. - TEAL'C'S HERE NOW. - AND HERE I WILL REMAIN. - I WAS WITH THOSE  WHO TOOK THE ONES YOU LOVE. - NO. YOU'RE PART OF THIS FAMILY NOW. WE'RE NOT LEAVING YOU BEHIND. THIS THING WON'T WORK IN HERE. TRY IT FROM OUT THERE. COME ON. [ Electrical Hiss ] - DID IT WORK ? - THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. THANK YOU, DANIEL JACKSON. WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW IT CAN BE DONE, RIGHT ? NOW THAT THE HAMMER IS LOST, I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE'LL DO. AH, YOU SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT. THE GOA'ULD DON'T KNOW THE HAMMER WAS DESTROYED. SEAL UP THE CAVE. IF THEY COME BACK, AT LEAST THEY'LL BE PUT SOMEWHERE SAFE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME HAVE THE COURAGE... TO FACE MY GREATEST FEARS. THIS IS... TO REMEMBER OUR WORLD. THANK YOU. WE WILL NEVER FORGET. AND WE'D LIKE TO COME BACK. OH ! MMM ! I ALMOST FORGOT. HERE. IT'S A GIFT. ACTUALLY, IT'S FOR THOR, OR HIS PEOPLE, IN CASE THEY EVER COME BACK. IT'S ALL ABOUT OUR PEOPLE. WHO WE ARE. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE FRIENDS. [ Thunder Rolling ] THOR'S PLEASED. [ O'Neill ] THAT'S GREAT. TELL HIM WE'D LOVE TO MEET HIM SOME DAY IN PERSON. IT IS SAFE FOR YOU TO TRAVEL. YOU SHOULD GO NOW. DANIEL, WANT TO START DIALING HOME... BEFORE IT STARTS RAINING ? RIGHT.
