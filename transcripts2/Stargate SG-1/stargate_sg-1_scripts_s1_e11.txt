 NOW ! STOP. CHARGE. FIRST LOCK ENGAGED. LOVE. YOU KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT THAT PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT THING. OH, YEAH. I'LL, UH-- I'LL GO. I'LL GO. I'LL JUST-- JUST, UM, LET ME FINISH THIS REEL. YOU KNOW, YOU SEEM A TAD OBSESSED WITH THIS STUFF. THIS WAS TRANSFERRED FROM FILM OF EXPERIMENTS DONE ON THE GATE IN 1945. YOU DON'T FIND THAT THE LEAST BIT INTRIGUING ? OH, YEAH. NOTHING PIQUES MY INTEREST MORE THAN REPEATED FAILURE.

 LOOK AT THEM. THEY'RE TURNING THE GATE MANUALLY. IT'S INCREDIBLE. HOW MANY HOURS OF THIS STUFF HAVE YOU LOOKED AT ? THERE'S NO CONCLUSION TO THE FILE. THERE'S NO SUMMARY, NO NOTES. NO... REASON TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY GAVE UP. WELL, WHOLE BOXES OF MATERIAL COULD BE MISSING. NO. THE PENTAGON SAID THIS WAS EVERYTHING. OH, PLEASE. THE PENTAGON'S LOST ENTIRE COUNTRIES. COME ON ! DOCTORS HAVE TWO DAYS OF TESTS PLANNED FOR US. WONDERFUL TESTS. UH, JACK ? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. OBVIOUSLY NOT. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

 WHY WOULDN'T SOMEONE HAVE TOLD US THIS ? WHY WOULD THEY STOP THEIR RESEARCH IF THEY'D MANAGED TO TURN IT ON ? HOLY COW. HELLO, MARTHA. MRS. LANGFORD, THERE'S A YOUNG MAN WAITING FOR YOU IN THE KITCHEN. YOU LET A STRANGE YOUNG MAN INTO THE HOUSE ? YES. I'M SORRY. HE SAID HE KNOWS YOU. MY GOD. HELLO. UH, I'M SORRY. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN BACK ? OH. MY GOD, WHY ARE YOU BACK ? COLONEL O'NEILL SAID YOU STAYED ON ABYDOS. I SEE YOU GOT THE AMULET. YES, OF COURSE. I NEVER TAKE IT OFF. WHY AVOID MY QUESTION ? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT ? COLONEL O'NEILL, DR. JACKSON WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BRIEFING SG-4 THIS MORNING. HE'S NOT HERE.  HE'S NOT ANSWERING OUR PAGES. ANY IDEA WHERE HE IS ? I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE, SIR. CATHERINE, I COULDN'T TELL YOU. WHY NOT ? THEY WOULDN'T LET ME. EVERYTHING IS CLASSIFIED. YOU KNOW-- WHEN DID YOU BECOME AN UPSTANDING MEMBER OF THE MILITARY ? I'M NOT... EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. MAKE YOU SOME TEA. THEN YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR STARGATE COMMAND. THOUSANDS OF STARGATES, PLANETARY SHIFTS. - DIDN'T ANYONE THINK  I MIGHT BE INTERESTED ? - THAT'S WHY I CAME. NOW, SIX MONTHS LATER. YOU COULDA TOLD ME SOONER. YES. JUST LIKE YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME THERE WERE EXPERIMENTS DONE ON THE GATE IN 1945. MY FATHER HEADED UP A RESEARCH TEAM THAT WORKED ON THE GATE DURING THE WAR. ACTUALLY, THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS THEN. BUT PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WAS LIKE THAT, CURIOUS. THEY SUSPECTED THAT THE GATE WAS A WEAPON, OR COULD BE USED AS ONE. NOTHING EVER CAME OF IT. HOW DO YOU KNOW ? THE PENTAGON HAS RECENTLY BEEN DECLASSIFYING OLD MATERIALS. THEY RAN ACROSS A NUMBER OF FILE BOXES THAT DEALT WITH THE OLD EXPERIMENTS. - THEY SENT THEM TO US. - REALLY ? - YOU WEREN'T INVOLVED  IN THE RESEARCH ? - [ Scoffs ] MILITARY HAD VERY LITTLE USE FOR A 21-YEAR-OLD GIRL AT THAT TIME. NEITHER DID MY FATHER. I ONLY KNOW WHAT LITTLE I OVERHEARD HIM AND ERNEST TALKING ABOUT. I'M SORRY, WHO'S ERNEST ? WE GET AS FAR AS ENTERING THE FIFTH SYMBOL, AND THEN THE WHOLE ROOM STARTS TO SHAKE. TODAY, ONE OF THE GENERATORS EXPLODED FROM THE FEEDBACK. ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO MY FATHER ? OH, HE KNOWS. HE WAS THERE. I MEANT ABOUT US. OH. YES, I WILL. MAYBE IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. WHAT ? THE RING. - MAYBE IT'S SUPPOSED TO SHAKE. - I DON'T THINK SO. ARE YOU USING ALTERNATING OR DIRECT CURRENT TO CHARGE IT ? ALTERNATING, I THINK. WHY ? TRY USING DIRECT. IT MIGHT PREVENT THE CHARGE FROM BOUNCING BACK TO THE GENERATOR. AND YOU SHOULD TALK TO MY FATHER. I WILL. I PROMISE. SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE GOVERNMENT KEPT THE FILES FROM THE ORIGINAL EXPERIMENTS ? I HAD MY FATHER'S NOTES. HE TOLD ME THAT WAS EVERYTHING THEY HAD. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ADMINISTRATIONS I HAD TO PETITION... TO GET THIS PROGRAM STARTED UP AGAIN ? FORTY YEARS HAD PASSED. THE INFORMATION WAS CLASSIFIED AND BURIED. I NEVER ASKED FOR ANY FILES BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD THEM. GENERAL WEST NEVER OFFERED BECAUSE HE PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THEY EXISTED. SO... YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY TURNED THE GATE ON IN 1945. WHAT ? THERE MUST BE OVER 100 MILLION POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS. IF IT'S A COMBINATION LOCK USED TO TURN IT ON, WHY 39 SYMBOLS ? WHY NOT SIX ? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? THEY'RE NOT COMBINATIONS. THEY'RE DESTINATIONS, AND WE JUST FOUND ONE. "DOORWAY TO HEAVEN" CAN MEAN ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS. IT COULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT ANYONE WHO PASSES THROUGH THERE WILL DIE, FOR EXAMPLE. CATHERINE, WE HAVE A MAID FOR A REASON. I WANTED TO DO IT. NO, I NEVER KNEW THEY TURNED IT ON. MY FATHER NEVER TOLD ME. IT WASN'T IN HIS NOTES EITHER. THEN THERE'S SOMETHING MORE YOU SHOULD SEE. HERE, WATCH THIS. OH, GOD. THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT TODAY. AN EXPLOSION IN THE LAB. ERNEST ? I'M SO SORRY. SO THE MAN WHO WENT THROUGH THE GATE IS ERNEST ? YES. MY FATHER MUST HAVE LIED TO ME. HE SAID ERNEST DIED IN AN ACCIDENT, AN EXPLOSION. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT ? - HE PROBABLY THOUGHT  HE WAS PROTECTING ME. - FROM WHAT ? FROM KNOWING THE MAN I WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY... CHOSE TO RISK HIS LIFE AND GO THROUGH THE STARGATE... WITHOUT EVEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT. HE CHOSE HIS IDEA, HIS WORK OVER ME. WELL, I'M SURE HE BELIEVED HE WOULD COME BACK. HE WAS SO YOUNG, SO FULL OF PASSION. LIKE YOU. YOU REMINDED ME OF HIM WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU. THAT'S WHY I KNEW YOU'D SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF THE GATE. CATHERINE ! I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO SHOW YOU THIS. ACTUALLY, I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO SHOW YOU ANY OF THIS, BUT NOW-- COMPUTER ENHANCEMENTS FROM THE FILM FOOTAGE. I WAS ABLE TO ISOLATE THE CHEVRONS THAT WERE LOCKED IN BEFORE ERNEST WENT THROUGH. NOT ABYDOS ? NO, ANOTHER PLANET WITH SIMILAR COORDINATES. AND WE CAN GO THERE. [ Man ] HAVE YOU COMPLETELY LOST YOUR MIND ? WHO AUTHORIZED YOU TO REVEAL CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO A CIVILIAN ? SIR, IF YOU WILL JUST LET ME EXPLAIN. THIS IS A SERIOUS BREACH OF PROTOCOL. THESE RULES EXIST FOR A REASON, DOCTOR. DO YOU THINK YOU'RE ABOVE THEM ? - NO. NO, I-- - CATHERINE ! HELLO, JACK. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I TRUST THE GENERAL IS MAKING YOU FEEL RIGHT AT HOME. -SO FAR HE ACTUALLY SOUNDS  WORSE THAN GENERAL WEST. - HE'S A TEDDY BEAR. COLONEL, DID YOU AUTHORIZE DR. JACKSON TO REVEAL CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THIS CIVILIAN ? ABSOLUTELY NOT, SIR. IN FACT, I ADVISED HIMNOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO HER, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE USED TO RUN THE ENTIRE PROGRAM... AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE GATE. - I'M AWARE OF WHO SHE IS. - CATHERINE, THIS IS TEAL'C. TEAL'C, THIS IS CATHERINE. DANIEL HAS TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU. SUCH A PLEASURE. COLONEL, ARE YOU AWARE OF THE REQUEST... DR. JACKSON HAS MOST CURRENTLY TABLED ? YOU GOTTA GO THAT ONE STEP FURTHER, DON'T YA ? THE MAN WHO WENT THROUGH THE GATE IN 1945 WAS CATHERINE'S FIANCE. NOW, I HAVE THE ADDRESS OF THE PLANET HE WENT TO, AND WE CAN GO THERE. AND I'M COMING WITH YOU. GENERAL, WE KNOW WHERE ERNEST LITTLEFIELD WENT. HE COULD STILL BE ALIVE. A MAN WHO HAD THE VISION TO SEE THE GATE FOR WHAT IT WAS... A HALF A CENTURY BEFORE ANYONE ELSE. HE SOUNDS LIKE A BONA FIDE AMERICAN HERO, SIR. SIR, THERE MAY BE ANOTHER REASON TO GO TO THIS PLANET. SAMANTHA. CATHERINE. - CAPTAIN CARTER. - YES, SIR. IT SEEMS THE PLANET IN QUESTION IS CLOSE TO ABYDOS, SO IT USES MANY OF THE SAME POINTS IN SPACE AS LOCATORS, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE TEAM IN '45 COULD COINCIDENTALLY DIAL IN ... WITHOUT COMPENSATING FOR PLANETARY SHIFT. BUT, SIR, THE PLANET IN QUESTION IS NOT ON THE CARTOUCHE WE FOUND ON ABYDOS. WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ? THE GOA'ULDS HAVEN'T CHARTED IT. THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THERE. IF THE GOA'ULDS HAVEN'T BEEN TO THIS PLANET, THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A GATE THERE. THEN WE WOULD HAVE UNQUESTIONABLE PROOF THAT THEY DIDN'T BUILD THE STARGATES. THE GOA'ULD ARE SCAVENGERS. SINCE THEY HAVE NOT TRAVELED TO THIS PLANET, WE MAY FIND TECHNOLOGIES  WE CAN USE AGAINST THEM. - YOU SPEAK ? - WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU. THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION, BUT I WAS ALREADY CONVINCED BY DR. JACKSON'S INITIAL ARGUMENT. ERNEST LITTLEFIELD COULD STILL BE ALIVE, AND WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND HIM. [ Electronic Whirring,  Beeping ] IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE. READY ? YOU OKAY ? HA ! THAT WAS SOME PIECE OF CAKE. IT'S HOT IN HERE. OH, YEAH. DID ANYBODY SEE A WAY IN OR OUT OF THIS PLACE ? THERE APPEARS TO BE ONLY TWO DOORWAYS. OH, MY. AW, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD. DR. LITTLEFIELD ? ERNEST ? HELLO. I'M DANIEL JACKSON. WE JUST CAME THROUGH THE STARGATE. YES, UH, THAT THING. THE STAR... GATE. WE'RE REAL. [ Crying ] IT'S ABOUT TIME. [ Sniffling,  Crying Continues ] WHOA ! OH, BOY. DANIEL, DO SOMETHING. DR. LITTLEFIELD ? YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE ME. C-CATHERINE ? HMM ! FIFTY YEARS. THAT'S ALL HE HAS TO SAY. I'LL-I'LL GO SEE IF I CAN FIND HIM. [ Sighs ] STILL HERE ? UH-- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO WEAR ? CLOTHES ? OH, UH-- UH, GOING HOME. YES, WE'RE TAKING YOU HOME. SO MUCH TIME. DID NO ONE TRY AGAIN ? THAT'S A LONG STORY. ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE HERE ? NO ONE ELSE LIVES HERE ? HOW 'BOUT NEARBY ? ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU'VE BEEN COMPLETELY ALONE HERE FOR 50 YEARS ? EAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED. I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S RIGHT HERE. LIGHT YEARS AWAY, BUT STILL SO CLOSE ALL THIS TIME, ALIVE ! I THINK HE'S PROBABLY HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE DEALING WITH IT TOO. I FELT LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL. MY HEART WAS BEATING FASTER THAN WHEN I CAME THROUGH THE GATE. OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE OLD AND WISE. I-I DON'T THINK THE HEART EVER GROWS OLD. [ Sighs ] I CAN'T EVEN FATHOM WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH. SUCH A LONG TIME. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT MAN. WHY DON'T YOU GO AND TALK TO HIM ? LAST DAY. IT'S A CALENDAR, ISN'T IT ? HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO BUILT THIS PLACE OR WHO USED TO LIVE HERE ? - HELIOPOLIS. - HELIOPOLIS ? REPOSITORY, PHILOSOPHY, ASTRONOMY. I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CITY. PEOPLE WOULD COME FROM EVERYWHERE TO GATHER THERE, SCHOLARS, COMMUNITY LEADERS. IT WAS ALSO THE CENTRAL PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR RA. ARE THERE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHS HERE, SYMBOLS THAT INDICATE RA ? THIS COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. "FOUR DISTINCT LANGUAGES.  WRITING IS UNLIKE ANYTHING  ON EARTH. CATHERINE SAYS THEY'RE PROBABLY ALIEN." "CATHERINE SAYS ?" SHE FOUND ME LONG AGO. "WE WALKED FOR MILES TODAY,  AND STILL FOUND NO SIGNS  OF CIVILIZATION. "CATHERINE SEEMS CONCERNED,  BUT I AM NOT. "AS LONG AS SHE IS HERE WITH ME,  I WILL NEVER FEEL ALONE. "IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE,  BUT EVERY DAY  WE'RE HERE TOGETHER, I LOVE HER MORE." MY FATHER LIED TO ME. OH. UH... I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO. SO REAL. YES. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BELIEVE. THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME EITHER. Y-YOU-YOU LOOK DIFFERENT. I'M OLD, ERNEST. SO ARE YOU. WE-WE HAD A WONDERFUL LIFE TOGETHER. I COULDN'T IMAGINE YOU, ERNEST. IN MY MIND, WE DIDN'T HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. FORGAVE ME. YOU FORGAVE ME LONG AGO. NO, I DIDN'T. OH. DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYBODY ELSE AROUND. I'LL TELL YOU, THIS PLACE USED TO BE PRETTY SWEET, BUT IT'S SEEN BETTER DAYS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I THINK PROFESSOR LITTLEFIELD HAS BEEN ALONE SINCE HE GOT HERE. WOW. [ Thunderclap ] A STORM APPROACHES. A PRETTY BIG ONE AT THAT. - IT COMES EVERY YEAR. - EVERY YEAR ? NOW, LOOK, KIDS, WE'RE RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF A CLIFF HERE. I DON'T THINK THIS PLACE COULD WITHSTAND ANOTHER BIG HIT. WE SHOULD TAKE OUR LEAVE. [ Daniel ] NO, WE CAN'T. NOT YET. WE'VE ONLY BEGUN TO EXPLORE THIS PLACE, FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT USED TO BE. [ O'Neill ] WE LAUNCHED A SURVEY BALLOON. NOW, LET'S TAKE THE PROFESSOR AND CATHERINE HOME. WE'LL LEAVE THE PROBE HERE, LET IT MONITOR THE SITUATION... TILL THE STORM BLOWS OVER, AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK, ALL RIGHT ? I TRIED FOR YEARS TO MAKE IT WORK. YOU NEVER TRIED ENTERING DIFFERENT GLYPHS IN THIS THING ? WE CALL THIS THE DIAL-HOME DEVICE. BASICALLY, YOU ENTER THE CORRECT ADDRESS AND-- DANIEL, WHY DON'T WE JUST SHOW HIM ? MY GOD. WHAT THE HELL ? I THOUGHT THE PROBE WAS SUPPOSED TO DETECT STUFF LIKE THIS. WE GOT VISUAL CONFIRMATION OF ITS PRESENCE, BUT THE DAMAGE WAS OBVIOUSLY CONCEALED. IT'S NOT WORKING. [ Ernest ] IT WAS LIKE THAT WHEN I GOT HERE. THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER CAME BACK. DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING HOME ? [ Beeping ] SINCE WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE A WHILE, I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE SOMETHING. [ Daniel ] WHAT ? COME ON. IT'S THE SAFEST ROOM THERE IS. YOU KNOW ? ESPECIALLY IN A STORM. GIVE ME A HAND. [ Groans ] THANKS. KEEP AT IT. WE'LL BE BACK. [ Whirring ] WHAT IS THIS PLACE ? "I BELIEVE THIS ROOM IS  SOME SORT OF MEETING PLACE... "WHERE FOUR ALIEN RACES  DENOTED BY THE SYMBOLS... "AND DISTINCTIVE WRITING  ON THE WALLS WOULD GATHER... "POSSIBLY TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE  OR DISCUSS RELATIONS, "LIKE A UNITED NATIONS  OF THE STARS. CATHERINE AGREES." YOU'RE RIGHT. I WOULD HAVE. ALL ROADS SEEM TO LEAD HERE, WHICH MEANS THIS IS LIKELY THE POWER SOURCE. I BELIEVE YOU ARE CORRECT. IT COULD TAKE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THESE CRYSTALS BACK PROPERLY. I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO RIG THE POWER SOURCE... DIRECTLY TO THE GATE, THEN DIAL IN MANUALLY. THIS LOOKS FAMILIAR. TOUCH IT. WHOA ! - IT'S BEAUTIFUL. -DANIEL, DOES THIS  MEAN ANYTHING ? WELL, IF THIS WAS A MECCA OF SORTS-- AN ALIEN UNITED NATIONS-- THIS HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING. - I KNOW THIS. - OF COURSE.  HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY. ONE PROTON, ONE ELECTRON. HYDROGEN. [ Catherine ] BERYLLIUM. SODIUM. SILVER, IRON. BARIUM, XENON. OH, MY GOD. SO MANY ELECTRONS. HOW CAN YOU TELL ? I'VE BEEN HERE A VERY LONG TIME. REMEMBER ? EXCUSE ME. ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL OF THESE ARE ATOMIC THINGS ? THESE IMAGES ARE THE GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE BASIC ELEMENTS: ELECTRONS REVOLVING AROUND A PROTON. THE NUMBER OF ELECTRONS INDICATING THE ELEMENT. HUNDRED AND FORTY-SIX. THERE ARE CURRENTLY ONLY 111 ELEMENTS ON THE PERIODIC TABLE. ONLY 90 WHEN I LAST LOOKED. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO SPECULATE ON... THE ACTUAL APPEARANCE AND STRUCTURE OF AN ATOM. THE FACT THAT FOUR COMPLETELY ALIEN RACES... CHOSE TO REPRESENT IT VISUALLY IN AN ALMOST IDENTICAL WAY. THE BASIC ELEMENTS ARE WHAT MAKE UP THE UNIVERSE. THEY ARE THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK-- OF COURSE ! HOW DO YOU ENSURE UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION ? YOU REDUCE THE METHOD OF COMMUNICATION TO THE MOST BASIC ELEMENTS... COMMON TO EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS IN THE UNIVERSE. JACK, THIS IS A TRUE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE. TURN THE PAGE.  TURN THE PAGE. WHAT ? [ Whirring, Beeping ] ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS-- THIS IS LIKE A BOOK ? I TRIED TO READ IT.  I TRIED TO UNDERSTAND, BUT-- [ Daniel ] A HUNDRED AND FORTY-SIX ELEMENTS, LETTERS OR WORD SYMBOLS. IF THEY'RE LETTERS, IF THEY'RE PICTOGRAPHIC, THIS COULD TAKE A LIFETIME. MORE. OH. SORRY. DANIEL, BEFORE YOUR HEAD EXPLODES, MAY I REMIND YOU THAT WE'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DEAL WITH. DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT THIS COULD MEAN ? ACTUALLY NO. THIS COULD BE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING OUR EXISTENCE, EVERYONE, EVERYTHING'S EXISTENCE. A COLLABORATION OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE FOUR ALIEN SPECIES. NONE OF WHICH WILL MEAN SQUAT IF WE DON'T GET OUT OF HERE. HOW'S IT GOIN' ? WE'RE TRYING TO CONNECT THE POWER SOURCE... FROM THE DIAL-HOME DEVICE DIRECTLY INTO THE GATE. I'M ABOUT TO RUN A TEST. WHERE'S DANIEL ? OH, ERNEST WAS SHOWING HIM A NEW TOY. REALLY ? WHAT ? SOME FANCY LIGHT SHOW... THAT MAY BE THE KEY TO OUR EXISTENCE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. [ Thunder Rolling ] UH, YOU WANT TO PICK UP THE PACE ON THIS A LITTLE BIT ? [ Hissing ] [ Whirring ] [ Hissing ] YOU DID IT ! [ Whirring Stops ] [ Creaking ] GET BACK ! YOU ALL RIGHT ? THIS IS HOW YOU KNEW WHAT THIS PLACE WAS. YOU RECOGNIZE IT TOO. OTHALA, THE NORSE RUNE THOUGHT TO REPRESENT THE COLLECTION OF... NUMINOUS POWER AND KNOWLEDGE FROM PAST GENERATIONS. AND THE GATHERING OF CLANS TO SHARE A COMMON INTEREST. YOU KNOW, THERE'S MORE THAN JUST A COINCIDENCE HERE. BUT THAT MEANS THAT HUMANS WERE HERE... CENTURIES, MAYBE EONS AGO. NOT HUMANS, ALIENS. THIS IS THOR'S RACE. THOR WAS AN ALIEN ? OH, YEAH, THAT'S, UH-- THAT'S ANOTHER... LONG STORY. BUT A GOOD ONE. ALL RIGHT, BASIC SURVIVAL TRAINING. WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE. WHAT DO WE NEED ? WE HAVE THE STARGATE.  WE NEED THE DIAL-HOME DEVICE. THANK YOU, TEAL'C. THE ELEMENT THE GATE IS MADE UP OF ABSORBS ENERGY DIRECTLY. INTERNAL FUNCTIONS WILL CONVERT AND STORE THAT ENERGY IN CAPACITOR-LIKE RESERVOIRS. THE INSIDE WHEEL WILL ONLY UNLOCK AND SPIN FREELY ONCE THERE'S ENOUGH RESERVE POWER. SO WHAT WE NEED IS ENERGY. MM-HMM. I DON'T SEE ANY ELECTRICAL OUTLETS. DO YOU ? THIS IS USELESS. IT'S NOT ALLOWING FOR ANY RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE. HOW DID YOU INCORPORATE THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THE INFORMATION ? LOOK DOWN. OF COURSE. YOU MEASURED THE ELEMENT'S DISTANCE FROM A CENTRAL POINT, DEGREES FROM ZERO AROUND IN A CIRCLE, AND HEIGHT ABOVE THE FLOOR. WHAT'S UP, GUYS ? STEP AWAY FROM THE PEDESTAL, DANIEL. WHAT ? WHY ? THE DIAL-HOME DEVICE JUST FELL THROUGH THE FLOOR INTO THE OCEAN. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ? THAT THING MAY HAVE A POWER SOURCE IN IT THAT WE CAN USE TO GET THE GATE WORKING. UH, NO. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS BOOK MAY CONTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSE. THIS IS MEANING-OF-LIFE STUFF. I HAVE TO GET MORE OF IT DOWN ON PAPER BEFORE WE LEAVE. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING MORE YOU CAN USE. - WHAT ABOUT USING ENERGY  FROM TEAL'C'S STAFF ? - IT ISN'T POWERFUL ENOUGH. DANIEL, THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME. WE HAVE TO GET INSIDE THAT THING. THIS WHOLE PLACE COULD JOIN THE D.H.D. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. SO, PLEASE. GREAT. SHOOT IT. [ Hisses ] NOW WHAT ? [ Thunderclap ] I'M OBVIOUSLY NO SCIENTIST, BUT, UH, COULDN'T WE USE THAT BEN FRANKLIN THING ? THE ELEMENT THE GATE IS MADE UP OF IS A SUPERCONDUCTOR. IT'LL ABSORB ENERGY IN MANY FORMS: HEAT, NUCLEAR, SOLAR, STATIC. IF WE COULD CHANNEL A LIGHTNING STRIKE INTO THE GATE, IT MIGHT PROVIDE US WITH ENOUGH POWER TO DIAL IN AND MAKE IT THROUGH. HOW DO WE ATTRACT LIGHTNING TO STRIKE THE GATE ? NOT DIRECTLY. WE'LL HAVE TO RIG SOMETHING UP ON THE ROOF... AND HOPE THAT THE SUDDEN AND ENORMOUS CHARGE DOESN'T DESTROY THE GATE'S MECHANISMS. WE GOT IT, TEAL'C. DANIEL WON'T COME UP. HE'S OBSESSED WITH THAT THING. SO MUCH LIKE YOU USED TO BE. - HMM.  THE TORMENT OF TANTALUS. - WHAT ? TANTALUS WAS A KING IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY... BANISHED TO HADES, FORCED TO STAND IN WATER THAT RECEDED WHEN HE TRIED TO DRINK. EVERLASTING, UNENDING TEMPTATION. HE WAS REACHING FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS... OUT OF REACH. - THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR. - HMM. SOME MIGHT SAY THAT'S WHAT MAKES A MAN GREAT. IF WE ALL ACCEPTED WHAT WAS WITHIN OUR GRASP-- SOMETIMES WHAT WE HAVE IS OF MORE VALUE. IT TAKES A GREAT MAN TO RECOGNIZE THAT. I DIDN'T. I WAS A FOOL. ERNEST, YOU'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH. NO SENSE WASTING TIME IN THE PAST. RIGHT ? AH, LOOK, FOR THE PEAK OF THE ROOF. IT WILL ATTRACT THE LIGHTNING. [ Groans ] YOU GET DANIEL. TAKE THIS TO THE ROOF. YOU HAVE TO COME NOW. NOT YET. COME AND GET ME WHEN THEY'VE GOT THE GATE RUNNING. THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TIME. I HAVE TO FINISH THIS. THIS IS NOT WORTH IT. THIS IS. NOTHING IS. OUR HISTORY AS A PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT IF EVERYONE FELT THAT WAY. NO PRIZE IS WORTH ATTAINING IF YOU CAN NEVER SHARE IT. THERE WOULD BE NO POINT. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. LET'S GO ! TEAL'C, START DIALING IN. WE MAY ONLY HAVE SECONDS ONCE THE GATE IS OPEN. WHAT YOU DID WAS COURAGEOUS. WHAT I DID WAS STUPID. COME ON, BOYS. WE GOTTA GO NOW ! I'M STAYING. WHAT ? LOOK, I WILL BE FINE DOWN HERE. GO ON. GO ON. DANIEL, WE CAN COME BACK. NO. WHAT IF THE CASTLE CRUMBLES AROUND THE GATE ? THIS COULD ALL BE LOST. - I COULD UNBURY THE GATE AGAIN. - WHAT IF THE GATE FALLS  INTO THE OCEAN ? - I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. - I'M NOT ! LET'S GO. JACK ! PLEASE. LET'S GO. - IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE. - NOT FROM WHAT I REMEMBER. GO. GO, TEAL'C. GO ! [ Man #1 ] STARGATE TEAM RECEIVING SQUAD, STAND READY. [ Man #2 ] YES, SIR. WORMHOLE IS DESTABILIZING. STILL NO TRAVELERS. COME ON, GUYS. STAND BY, PEOPLE. [ Man, Indistinct ] CLOSE ONE. YOU THINK ? YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE. [ Man ] CHEVRON SIX ENCODED. CHEVRON SEVEN... WILL NOT ENGAGE. - WELL, I THINK IT'S SAFE  TO SAY THE PLACE IS GONE. - YOU STILL HAVE MY BOOK. - CAPTAIN CARTER'S WORKING  ON A COMPUTER MODEL RIGHT NOW. -[ Man ] GO TO REACTOR SEVEN. AND HERE'S THE BRIGHT SIDE: YOU'RE ALIVE. YES. THANKS TO YOU. LOOK AT IT THIS WAY: IF YOU EVER RUN INTO THOSE ALIENS WHO MADE UP THE LANGUAGE, YOU CAN ASK THEM WHAT IT MEANS. YOU BETTER LET US KNOW THIS TIME. I WILL.  I PROMISE. CATHERINE, HUG ME. [ Laughs ] OH, JACK.
