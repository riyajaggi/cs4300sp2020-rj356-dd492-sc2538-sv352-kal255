 Scooby Doo Mystery,Inc 1x02 ♪ The Creeping Creatures Original air date on July 19, 2010 -- sync by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.Com -- Are you sure this is New York City? - Yeah, absolutely. Now, if I'm not mistaken, this here is, uh, Broadway. What's that street sign say? "Gator Avenue." Hmm. I wonder how far Gator Avenue is from Broadway. According to this map, 2,000 miles. Well, in that case, we're going to need to fill up the tank. [chuckles]

 [Growling] Gator man! [screaming] [Growling] [All screaming] [Tires squealing] Puddles! [barking] [Growling] [Snarling] Scooby: Scooby-dooby-doo! [Thunder] [Rain falling] Oh, I am so bored. We haven't had a good mystery in I don't know when! [Sighs] [Sighs] Fred, I think I've read every magazine in your house. What's that? No, don't! Dohh! [thud] "Traps illustrated"? Freddy! I, uh, I read it for the articles. In fact, it's where I got the idea for this little beauty. Who do you expect to trap outside your front door? [Doorbell rings] [Groaning] Let's find out. I got a package for, uh, Fred Jones. Hey, that's me. Ahh--oh! What is it? [Thunder] Like, um, I think it's a box. [Gasps] It's from Mr. E! "Saved this for a rainy day. Enjoy." Hmmph, Mr. E gives me the creeps. Fred, careful. That could be a bomb. Ooh, strike that. Cute purse. Check it out-- "100% pure gator, made in Gatorsburg." Gatorsburg? But that's impossible. Gatorsburg hasn't manufactured gator products in decades. Not since the gator mines dried up. Gator mines? [thunder] Gatorsburg was founded back in the 1800s, when a group of prospectors searching for gold struck something much more valuable-- alligator. Yeah! We're all gonna be rich! [All laughing and cheering] Gatorsburg had more alligators than anywhere in the world. Overnight, Gatorsburg became a boomtown. The town became famous for its gator skin products. Then the gator wells ran dry. Gatorsburg became a ghost town. But, like, Freddy, it says it was made in Gatorsburg. [Sniffs] Ooh, smells new. Gang, we have a mystery on our hands. Oh, sweet Christmas, finally! [All yelling] Oh, boy! [Tires squealing] This is what happens when a civilization is founded on an entirely gator-based economy. All right, gang, let's split up and look for clues. What do you say, shaggy? Want to go clue hunting with me? Velma! Come on, not in front of Scoob! [Sniffing] Hmm? I didn't touch it! Why, dude, how about we check out gator burger? Sounds delicious! [Growling] [Gasps] Like, jackpot, Scooby-doo! Ahh! Hmm? Both: Oooh. [Both moaning] We need to talk. Velma, like, I would love to, but, like, I can't hear anything over the sound of my own stomach. It's going, "like, maybe give me a triple with cheese "and chili, and, like, a pickle." You know what? Forget it. Velma, wait up! Like, velm, what did I do? Nothing. You didn't do anything. So, me not doing anything is the thing that you're mad about? Like, why do girls have to be so confusing? Let's go, gang, there's nothing to trap here. Looks like Mr. e. Sent us on a wild goose Chase. Ah, yeah, more like a wild gator Chase! Ha ha! [Clicking] Hmm, that's weird. Can you tell what the problem is, fred? You see that hole there? That should be an engine. [Engine revving] [Thunder] You kids are in some serious trouble! [Shaggy gulps] [Thunder] Care to tell me what you're doing in Gatorsburg? Our van broke down. Maybe you could take a look at it. You look like you've got the hands for the job. Hey, what size is your ring finger? Why the heck should I help you? Because you're... A mechanic? [Sighs] Touché. Here's your problem. Engine's missing. I'm gonna have to order a new one from crystal cove. Seeing as that's over 3 miles away, it won't arrive until morning. So, like, you're saying we're stuck in this super creepy gator town all night long? [Dialing] [Line ringing] Hello? Hello? Yes? Hey, mom, we're stuck in Gatorsburg. The van broke down. Think you can come and get us? Oh, I wish I could, but tonight's race night. You know me and horses. Venus is in its third retrograde, which means I'm betting on sick little monkey to show. Well, lentil and mushroom caps, fred! I've already got the recliner in the reclined position. There's no going back from that. [Slurping] Oh, sweetie, it's dark out. I can't go out in the dark! [Dialing] [beep] You have reached the Rogers' residence. We're busy right now. Please call back. Ohh, wait. Duh. It's still life night. Guess we're here for the whole night. And Scooby-dooby, too. Don't suppose you could recommend a hotel? My sister greta runs the best in town-- the drowsy gator. [Thunder] Oh, and a word of advice-- don't leave your rooms. Hmm? [Thunder] Raggy, raggy! Huh? [Whimpering] [Stammers] Huh? Hmm. [Piano playing] [Ring] [Ring ring] We ain't got no rooms. But your sign in the window says, "vacancy." Well, that sign's broken. But it's a painted sign. [Groans] Gunther, we got guests! [Slurping] Well! Hello! This is my son, gunther gator. I'm greta gator. Your last names are gator and you live in Gatorsburg? What a coincidence! Yeah, coincidence. [Both chuckling] Uh, we don't get many guests here at the drowsy gator. Shocker. Like, are those claw marks? I don't see any marks. I got a few hotel rules. Rule number one-- boys and girls in separate rooms, no exceptions! Then I guess I'm with you, Daphne. I said, no exceptions! But I'm a girl. Oh, right. Rule number two-- stay in your rooms, no matter what you hear. That includes screams, moans, wails, pounding, clawing, scratching, and anything that sounds like a body being dragged across a hardwood floor. [Whimpering] Ok... Well, shag, looks like you, me and Scoob are in this room. I almost forgot! Rule number three-- no pets in the hotel! What?! [chuckles] Hmm, Hmm, Hmm. It's ok, Scoob. You can sleep in the mystery machine. It's just one night, Scooby-doo. I'll see you in the morning, buddy. I hope so! [Both crying] I'm not a pet. Is there something different about your bangs? I raised them a half centimeter to bring out my forehead. Toodles. Where you going? I, uh, forgot something. What? I forget. Hmm. You know, shag, when we all graduate from High School and move in together, we can get a room just like this. You like bunk beds? I can't think about that right now, fred! Like, I'm really worried about Scoob! Well, I'd say check on him if it weren't for the fact that we were warned to stay in our rooms. Hey, do you prefer flannel or cotton sheets? Shaggy? Oh! Uh, oh. [Chuckles] Velma. Were you sneaking over to see me? Um, yeah. Like, I wanted to see you. But Freddy told me I had to go check on Scooby-doo, so I'm doing that. Trust me, Scoob is just fine. [Thunder] [Scooby whimpering] Raggy? [growling] [Whimpering] Huh? Daphne? I'm looking for velma. Have you seen her? No, but I'm glad you're here. I have something for you. You do? It's just a little memento of our time together. Oh, Freddy! A scrapbook! I bet it's filled with wonderful pictures of... Traps?! We used this one to catch the phantom of vasquez castle. Yeah, I remember. And this baby helped us nab carlotta the gypsy. Mm-hmm. I was there. And this one... [Scooby whimpering] No monsters, no monsters, no-- [thunder] [shrieking] [Indistinct yelling] Huh?! [Shrieking] Raggy! Raggy! Help! [Whimpering] [Shrieking] [Whimpering] [Ringing bell] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! [Whimpering] And I left a few pages blank. You know, for future traps. Good thinking. [Gasping] Scoob! What's the matter? He's trying to tell us something. Tator people. Uh, crater steeple? [Wheezing] Skater feeple! Gator people! Phew. Uh-huh, uh-huh. [Growling] [whimpering] [Glass breaking] [electricity flickering] [Scooby whimpering] Quick, on the bed! [Grunting] Oh, oh! No! [Daphne groaning] Oh, fred! Aah! My scrapbook! Aah! Oh, fred. [Shrieking] This is it. There's no escape! [Whimpering] I've got an idea. Quick, guys, the comforter. [Shrieking] [All grunting] [Gasping] Wow, look at this. No fred, no Daphne, no Scooby. Just us. Mmm! Hmm. [Panting] Raggy! Scooby-doo! What's going on? Gator people! Come again? Shh. [Fan squeaking] Maybe they're gone. [Electricity flickering] Oh! [All gasping] [Yelling] [Growling] [All screaming] [Both grunting] [Both screaming] [All gasping] [All screaming] [Shrieking] Move toward the door, very slowly. [Growling] [Screaming] Whoa! Oh! Ahh! Velma! Shaggy! [Groaning] Oh! You saved me! I did? Oh! Like, I did. Zoinks! [gasps] No! [Screaming] That's disgusting. Oh! Wait! That isn't real. It looks like part of a costume. [Snarling] [All groaning] [All screaming] [Shrieking] Scooby, get behind the wheel. Huh? But the mystery machine is broken! Which is why we're going to push it. [Shrieking] [All grunting and groaning] [Growling] [Tires squealing] Look! They're stopping. [Growling] They weren't trying to eat us. They just want us out of town. Why? I don't know. But if we're going to solve this mystery, we have to go back into Gatorsburg. Both: Say what? Like, it's them. [Grunting] Huh? "100% pure gator." This belt is just like the purse Mr. e sent us. Let me see that. [Groaning] What happened? I'm allergic to imitation animal skin. Pleather, fake fur-- it all makes me break out. That belt isn't 100% pure gator. It's a fake. They're all fakes. So, like, those fake gator people are selling fake gator products? Dude! We are dealing with serious irony! We have to stop them. Like, dude, you gator freaks! You're, like, the ugliest crocodiles ever! Who are you calling a crocodile? Get them! [Growling] [Panting] [Growling] Now! [Groaning] [All grunting and screaming] Got 'em. Old 45, gets 'em every time. [Groans] [Sirens] Time to find out who these greedy gators really are. Grady gator? Greta gator? Gunther gator? But why? After we ran out of gators, everybody moved out of Gatorsburg. But not us. This here is our home. So, with no alligators left, you decided to make imitation gator products and pass them off as real. But you couldn't have anyone snooping around Gatorsburg. So, you created the creeping creatures to scare people away. Then you could run your counterfeit gatoring whatever anyone knowing who you were or what you were up to. Why, that is one ridiculous plan. And you know what? We would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling juveniles and your unauthorized investigation of our synthetic gator accessories. You're tellin' me this gator stuff is fake?! I paid a fortune for this tracksuit! Sorry, sheriff. [Sighs] Man, I gotta get out of this suit. This fake gator doesn't breathe. I'm starting to smell a little... Funky. Arrest them, even though I have absolutely no jurisdiction here! Wait, sheriff, can you give us a ride? The mystery machine isn't-- [engine starts] [All gasp] Like, there's no engine in the mystery machine! It's haunted! It's from Mr. e. "Hope you had a good time in Gatorsburg. "But be warned--there are more mysteries to come. This is only one piece of the puzzle." Puzzle? What's that supposed to mean? Like, I've got a bad feeling we're going to find out!
