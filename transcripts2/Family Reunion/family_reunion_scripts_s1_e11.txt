 Family Reunion was filmed in front of a live studio audience. What in the world is all this noise? I could hear you all the way from the corner. Great news, M'Dear. Columbus has one less crooked cop. Mm-hm. That's right. Officer Whitman got fired and indicted. After years of harassing folks, he finally got his. Which means we're not moving back to Seattle at the end of the school year. So, M'Dear, is the party over? Let's burn this sucker down! Yeah!

 Let's go! Hoouh! Hoouh! Hoouh! Hoouh! Let's go, guys! - That was awesome. - It was dope, incredible, amazing. Wait, you've never seen a step show? - Of course I've seen a step show. - When? Just now. Stepping has roots in tribal African dance and historically has been a way for black folks to lift each other up through call and response. Y'all hear me? We do! I want to do it too.

 If you like it so much, we're holding tryouts this week. Sounds like a plan. See you at tryouts. Hoouh! Hoouh! Hoouh! Hoouh! Hoouh! This is gonna be so cool. Yeah, I can help you with your moves. Help me? What makes you think I need help? Check it. Aah! - Can you help me to the nurse's office? - Mm-hm. Zola, what are you wearing on our class trip to Six Flags? My turquoise caftan so I can connect with my Native American roots. How about you? I'm wearing my leather shorts so I can connect with some boys. Jade! I had to wait the whole winter break. What's the deal with you, Kurt and Ava's little love triangle? The people want to know. In order to salvage our friendship... Ava and I have decided to put Kurt in the friend zone. And there you have it. Jade has declared sisters over misters. I respect that. It's Dr. Carter. Good afternoon, class. I graded your homework last night, and through my tear-stained readers, I surmised that half of you have smocks and hairnets in your future. Oh. I'm glad I amuse you, Ms. Hayes. I prefer paper to plastic. That information will come in handy one day. Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. McKellan, is my math class getting in the way of your social life? Uh... I'll put it away. You will give it to me. Now. Mm. You got a D. I know you can do better. Math is important, people. Equations are problems. If you learn to problem-solve, life becomes easier. That should be your goal. Any questions? Oh, Ms. McKellan, you got a text. It's your mommy. She said you'd better bring her sweater back. Clean. Mm. Five, six, seven, eight. - Hey, hey. - 'Kay. - Nice. - Hey. Hit it. Hoouh! - That was so good, you two! - It sure was. That shoulder lean you added was a nice touch. Uh-huh. If you step like that, you both will definitely make the team. Thanks. Brooke, want to go out back, spin around, and see who gets nauseous first? Sounds good to me. Don't throw up in my garden again! Candy, we are gonna have so much fun - traveling with the step team. - Mmm-hmm. We can carpool, book adjoining rooms. Oh, and I'll pack the bottled waters and the bottles that look... - like waters! - Ohhhh! Look at you, girl! Well, I am a professional dancer. - Really? - Mm-hm. I was too. - Oh, Cocoa, you was a cheerleader. - And a dancer! I'll have you know, I danced with Alvin Ailey's... cousin. Candy, you dance with anybody I'd know? Oh, gosh, uh... - Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears... - Ohh. Ciara. Oh, wait! I remember you from the Level Up video. Yes, you remember this move? - Oh, get low. - Ohhh. - Get low. Now take it up. Watch. - Eeee. Hah! Oh, Miss Amelia, I see you, girl. Oh, don't let the church hat fool ya, you better ask somebody about me. - Whoo! Whoo! Ha! - Take it low, take it low, take it low. Moz, come on down here so I can see you in that sweater I knitted for you. Ooh. Oh, Cocoa, doesn't he look nice? He looks magically delicious, M'Dear. You've worked your charms once again. Okay, you've seen it. Now I'm taking it off. No! Daniel is bringing company over, so... you should leave it on. Yeah, Moz. Leave it on. Hey, sweetie, how was school? Ugh, horrible. Oh, you're wearing one of Mom's sweaters too. Why was school so horrible? Ugh, Dr. Carter was picking on me again. She's mean. The rumor is she eats babies. Oh, good for her. Staying away from those carbs. How can you laugh when I'm being persecuted? You do not know real pain. You're young, you have good skin. Talk to me when you need support hose. What's up, everybody? I want y'all to meet Janine. Hi, Jade. Oh. You saw me. Uh, you two know each other? Jade is in my Algebra 2 class. Ohhh. So you're Dr. Carter. Jade said you eat babies. I said it was a rumor. So you are a doctor. Well, Daniel is a good catch. He just needs the love of a good woman who can co-sign for him. So, Janine, how is Jade doing in class? Oh! Um, I'd like to invoke doctor-patient confidentiality. She's not that kind of doctor. Jade has all the potential in the world if she would just apply herself. But, unfortunately, she's passing with a D. Passing? Oh, high five! No, no, no, Jade, Jade, Jade. That is unacceptable. Jade already knows that she needs to get at least a B on Friday's midterm to pull her grade up. Well, you need to buckle down, young lady, especially if you want to go on that class trip to Six Flags. Good luck, Jade. Now, someone promised to take me to eat the best soul food in Columbus. - I sure did. - So where are we going? Going? Girl, we're already here. I suggest the pork chops and... mashed potatoes. I don't eat pork. I suggest the mashed potato. Mmm. Five, six, seven, eight. Wait, is it pop, snap, pop or pop, pop, snap? It's snap, snap, pop. I was way off. I've got good news and bad news. Lindsay decided to stay on the team, so we have 30 dancers vying for one spot. Was that the good news or the bad news? Good for us. Bad for all of you. Bye. I don't want to compete against you. Me either. Want to race to class? I don't know. Go! Uh, Jade, I still cannot find your homework assignment. Well, you can't grade what you can't see. Well, just bring it in tomorrow. Or the next day is fine. What's going on with Dr. Carter? I know. She's smiling. I'm scared. And you're lucky. What do you mean? - She's dating your uncle. - So? There's no way she's gonna fail her boyfriend's niece. You think? Okay, so before we move on to the next chapter... does anyone have any questions? Renee. Yes? Do you want to meet my uncle? Moz, today is your lucky day. This was balled up at the bottom of the Goodwill pile. One of the kids must have accidentally put it there. It's a good thing Cocoa found it. Thanks, Cocoa. Mmm. Any time, babe. - Mm-hm. - Mwah! - Mwah! Mmm. - Mmm. Mm-hm. Hey, girl. - Thank you. - Mm-mm-mm. Mmm. Miss Amelia, this mint tea is perfect. I'm so disappointed the kids aren't going out for the step team. I was really looking forward to us being step moms. I know. Me too. It would have been a blast. But it's sweet that Shaka and Brooke chose friendship rather than compete. Yeah. Not sure if it would have survived once Brooke won the final spot. Hm? What makes you think Shaka wouldn't have won the spot? I guess Shaka could see the writing on the wall. It was his idea to quit. I guess he has no follow-through. Oh, my grandson is not a quitter. That's right. He quit that a long time ago. That's right. Well... uh, Shaka, he may lose interest, but only because he's great at so many things. Like quitting. Okay? Well, Brooke can dance, but she can't stay on the beat if it was glued to her. I know. What did you say? She didn't stu-stu-stutter. You know what? Thank you for making this easy. Brooke will go out for the final spot. Oh... well, in that case... so will Shaka. Hm, and may the best step mom, I mean stepper... win. Well... you're all out of tea. Goodbye. She's got a lot of nerve talking about my grandson like that. I know, right? But you are going to have to work on his follow-through because he is a quitter. Wha...? I can say that! She can't. Daniel, if I turned into a zombie, would you leave me? Girl, no! I'd stay right by your little undead side. You lie so well. - Well, I lie because I care. - Mmm. Uh... sorry for interrupting. Oh! Excuse me. I need to take this call. Hi, Mom. Yes, I got your message. No, I don't need to freeze my eggs. I just want to say, whatever you're doing, keep it up. What are you talking about? Dr. Carter is in such a good mood. Well, I do have that effect on women. But only for short periods of time. Look, just keep her happy enough to give me a good grade on the midterm. No problem. In fact, I'll make sure she grades you on the uncle curve. Well, what do you think she's gonna give me? Whatever I tell her to. So are we thinking an A or a B? - Well... - Well, how about an R? For "R" you two crazy? Do you really think that I would give you an A just because I'm seeing your uncle? Well, I was thinking a B to make it more believable. Daniel, I don't do hookups. You will get the grade you earn, so I suggest you study, young lady. Take me home. Come on, Janine. Now, don't be like that. You can't leave! Give me one reason why I can't. Well, Moz isn't back yet, so I don't have wheels. You told me you have a car. No, I told you I have access to a car. Access. - I'll Uber. - Girl! Like... Baby! I'm totally screwed now. I thought you had more game than that. I thought I had more game than that! I guess I can kiss that Six Flags trip goodbye. Well, don't give up so easy. But the test is in the morning. Which means we have all night to cram. Now, where's your book? Are you even good at math? It's been a while, but let's see. All right. Ah! Quadratic equations. Yeah. This is easy. Yeah. All we need to do... is find a value... for X. And... And there you go. X equals zero. Wow. You actually know this stuff? Yeah. I scored a 750 in math on the SAT. Wow. What did you get on the other half? What other half? And... stop. I still don't understand why we're doing this. To build your stamina... and to learn some follow-through. I don't want to compete against Brooke. Sweetie, you're not competing against Brooke, okay? You're competing for a spot. Brooke is doing the same thing. How do you know? And what are we gonna do to win this position? - I'm stepping all over this competition. - Mm-hm. Five, six, seven, eight, hit! Step, clap! Hoouh! That's right. You ready to do this? Let's do this. Mmm. You have to want it! Double time. Triple time! You don't want it. Again. Again, come on! All right, around the world. Go! Go! There you go. Can I have some water? Moonwalk to it. Go! Moonwalk to it! Five, six, seven, eight. Hoouh! Aagh! Aagh! Aagh! Aagh! Blades, fist! Woo-hoo! That was perfect. You are ready, okay? Let's hit the sack. No. I won't sleep until Brooke goes down. I thought Brooke was your friend. Friends are a luxury we cannot afford. - Where did you hear that? - Mom. - Set your alarm for 6:00 a.m. - What? Well, Brooke will be up at five. Then I'll be up at 4:59. That is the eye of the tiger. Good job, buddy. I might actually win this thing. You or Shaka? That's what I said. Shaka. No, you didn't. - Yeah, I did. - No, you didn't. No, she didn't. Yes, I did. Cocoa, stop playing! Uh... Hm-mm. Okay. All done. So? Have fun at Six Flags. You got a B. Oh! Yes! Uncle Daniel and I studied all night. Well, it paid off. You're a very smart young lady, Jade. If you spent half as much time in your books as you did on social media, you might surprise yourself. You're right. What are you doing? That was good advice. I'm posting it. Hi, Dr. Carter. I'd like you to meet my uncle Troy. Really? Whatever happened to just giving the teacher an apple? Are we going to watch the tryouts? Yep. I'll wait until you get dressed. Oh, but, honey, I am dressed. I made it myself. Oh, and I have a surprise for you. It's not another sweater, is it? No. I made some matching pants. Wow. You even bedazzled my zodiac sign on the pockets? Yes, I did, my little Capricorn. And now we are going to be twinsies. All eyes will be on us! No doubt. Okay. - Get dressed now. Hurry up. - Oh. You have a matching hat. Oh, yes. You want me to make you one? Oh, no, no. Oh, no. No. You... you... you spoil me enough. Let's give it up for Bonnie and Jake. Hey! I'm glad you made it... I think. And, M'Dear... Oh, don't worry, Cocoa. I'll make you one, too. Your wife gets so jealous. And then there were two. Show some love for Shaka and Brooke. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Notice she said Shaka first. She knows what's up. Good luck, baby. Come on, Shaka! - Come on, Brooke! - Go, baby! - Come on, hit it hard. - There you go. There you go, Shaka, go! Yeah, yeah. - Get it, boy! - That's it, girl! Go! Hoouh! Hey, hey. Go, Brooke! Go, Brooke, hit it harder. Hit it, honey. Come on! Go, baby. Come on, Brooke! Do what Mommy tells you. - Don't quit! And again! - I told you I ain't fooling. And again! Brooke! I got this! Guys, that's enough. Why don't we just relax? Oof! Okay. - I'm the professional dancer. - Oh, really? - Yes. - Oh, really? - Okay. - Mom! Excuse us. Oh. I'm sorry. You've got this, baby. Just start again. - No? - Oh, you want us to stop dancing. - No? - Oh, cool. You want us to leave? Okay. What? You... you like my outfit? I have to leave too? Uh-uh, uh-uh. Ain't nobody going nowhere. Don't make me call your momma, Devine. And take those sunglasses off while you're inside. Walking round like you're Byron Allen or somebody. All right, all right, I think you'll all agree when I say that there are some great steppers up here. We had some tough decisions to make, but... we did it. The newest member to Salt and Steppers is... - Brooke Green! - Whoo! And... Shaka McKellan! They were too good to pick just one. Whoo! - We made the team! - We did it! - I knew you both could do it. - Ooh. I did too. We are proud of you, baby. Let's go take some pictures so we remember this moment. Why don't we do that later? - When? - When you change clothes. Hey, who's that over there? I'm sorry. Me too. I got a little caught up. Yeah, you did. But I did too. I guess it just shows you how much we love our kids. It shows how much you love winning. Well... Looks like we get to be step moms after all. Mm-hm. Ooh, maybe we should get matching T-shirts. That would be awesome. I'll get Shaka on mine. And I'll put Brooke on mine! All right, guys. Let's go. Uh-uh-uh. He is a married man. From now on, you are only going to be able to wear that sweater ensemble in the house.
