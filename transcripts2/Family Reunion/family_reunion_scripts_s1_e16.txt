 Family Reunion was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Woo! That was good, y'all. Of course. This is the Black Panther G-Club. We get down up in here. Up in here? This obviously isn't English class. Is somebody lost? No. Jade finally decided to accept our invitation to join. Mm-hm.

 Can you sing? Well, I was the lead soloist in my glee club back in Seattle and I killed at my family reunion picnic, so... I bet you did. Let's see what you got. Oh, I'm not going to audition for you. I'm going to wait for the director. Oh! Let me go get her. Someone looking for me? So what should I sing? Surprise me. Woo! You can sing.

 But can you sing? What's the difference? It's the difference between Katy Perry... and Fantasia. Listen up, K-pop... I want you to sing that song again and put some stank on it. Like this. Ooh. Okay, now your turn. - Oh, you want me to do that? - Mm-hm. Okay! Um... That stinks. Oh, thank you. She means stinks with an "I." Get it together, boo. Yo, Jade. Forget those haters. You sounded good. Thanks, Royale. Oh... you know my name? How come you never speak? That's 'cause you never speak. Small talk isn't my thing. Yeah. I'm surprised you're in glee club. We call it G-Club. I produce most of the arrangements. - I'm a rapper too. - Oh. Give me your number. Maybe we can do something. Ah, you talked to me for the first time two minutes ago and I'm supposed to give you my number? Yeah. Um, how about I take yours and then I'll decide whether I call or not? Works for me. Hello? I decided. Aaliyah? Just playing. "G is for Carole Gist, the first girl like me to win the Miss USA title." What are you reading? ABCs For Girls Like Me. Do you have to sit here and read it? No. "H is for Carla Hayden, the first girl like me to be Librarian of Congress." Really? Mom! Dad! Help! - Who did it? - What's wrong? I need help with my project for the robotics fair. When is it due? Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - How long have you known about this? She sprung it on us last month! Sweetie, I don't think you get the concept of springing. I think he needs a spanking. Oh, well, Cocoa, go change clothes. I guess we have to cancel house-hunting and date night because Mazzi procrastinated again. Yep, call the realtor. We don't need to find our dream house. We can live with your mom forever. Really? You'll do that for me? No! So you're just gonna leave me hanging? You made the mess, you take care of it. Good luck. And goodbye. - Really? - I know! Really? I'll help you, Mazzi. - Really? - Nope. I remember whenever I had a big project due, M'Dear would always bail me out. Especially if there was a prize attached. I won the robotics fair in fifth grade because of her. Why would M'Dear do that? Because she likes to win. She's the Bill Belichick of motherhood. But don't worry, I grew out of that whole procrastination thing. Really? So, why haven't you cleaned out the gutters like M'Dear asked you to two weeks ago? Like I told you yesterday, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh. How do you get it so stank? Stank? Nothing stank before you came in here. Oh, I'm sorry, I mean your voice. How do you make it so soulful? I came up in a house full of gospel singers. We literally had to sing for our supper. If you hit a wrong note, huh, no red beans and rice for you. So, as you know, I always hit the right note! Oh, yes, baby. I'm trying out for the glee club. Could you teach me how to sing like you? Of course I could. Come on, stand up. - Try this, okay? - Mm. Mm-hm. Okay? Now you try. And give it some attitude. Okay. I've got plenty of attitude. I know. I hear how you talk to your parents. Okay. Oh, that felt better. Oh. I just wish it sounded better. Sing the way you would do it, okay? Or just join the volleyball team. Seriously, M'Dear. This is important to me. Then you just be yourself or... look into volleyball. Oh, uh, thanks, M'Dear. I'm gonna go hang out with my friend Royale. Royale? She isn't one of those fast gals, is she? No, ma'am. Royale is definitely not a fast girl. - All right. - I'll be back before dinner. Okay. Boy... either tell me what's wrong or get up and go get your inhaler. It's just that I have this robotics project due tomorrow. Tomorrow? Have you asked your parents to help? Yeah, and they told me I had to figure it out. I'm just trying to win first place like Dad did. Oh, now your dad did not win that first place trophy all by himself. And I helped Grace and Daniel with their projects. Honey, I'm not new to this. I'm true to this. You got first place three times? Well, I would have, except that fool, Daniel, he ate half of his project. Oh, this is what they won? Uh-huh. Dad. Aunt Grace. - Oh, and Uncle Daniel. - Uh-huh. Yeah, he won third. You know, my name should have been on all of these! Well, if you help me win, I'll make sure your name is on my trophy. Or should I say... our trophy? Ah-ha! I like that! - Thanks for coming to my side of town. - Yeah, I've never been over here before. Oh... Tennis shoes hanging over phone lines. Dope. What cool installation art. I'll tell Jimmy you like them. When he gets out of juvie. Check this. Okay. You're good. But, I mean, you knew that already. I wish I had your confidence. My dad gave me the three-foot rule. What's that? Three feet in front of me, in back of me, and on both sides all belong to me. So I'm always in my own space. I love that. Hey... tomorrow night, I'm performing at this open mic. You should come and do something too. Oh, that would be a no. I don't think I'm all that interesting. We've all got a story to tell. Who is Jade? I don't know. M'Dear wants me to be a southern belle. Mikayla doesn't think I'm black enough and my dad wants me to be a nun. And we're not even Catholic. Maybe you need to stop trying to be who everybody else wants you to be and just be who you want to be. Do you write? - I've written a few poems... - I knew it. Let me hear something. No, they're stupid. If you thought they were stupid, you wouldn't have written them down. - It's in your phone, right? - But... Just go to the first poem. I promise I won't judge. Okay. But remember, you promised. I can't believe I'm doing this. "This is me with no apologies." I'm exactly who I want to be. This is me with no apologies. But we're still good. "Just don't want to be misunderstood." See, it's stupid. Nah. Jade, that was honest and vulnerable. It's the first time I've ever shared my poetry with anyone. It shouldn't be the last. No. I'm just starting to fit in. Fit in? That's gonna be impossible. And why is that? 'Cause I've never met anybody like you. Really? Really. - I've got to get home. - I've got to go to the studio. - Oh. - Hey, send me that poem. Really? Really. You know, you say, "really?" a lot. Really? Your project should be something useful that people can relate to. Yeah, like a car. That's crazy. We can't build a car by tomorrow. - Can we? - No! No, I'm telling you, Genevieve, Royale is pretty deep and he thinks I'm deep too. What's so funny? Hold on. Hey, M'Dear, could I have 20 dollars? I need it for my lunch account. Oh, sure, baby. Let me count it out for you. - One, two, three, four... - He's 16. Seventeen, 18. Oh, wait a minute. I got to start over. - One, two, three, four, five... - When did Mom and Dad say they'd be back? Ten. 11, 12, 13. Oh, shoot! Listen, could you all just be quiet so I can finish my count? - One, two... - I know what we need. A money counter. Ooh, I'd like that too. Oh, shoot! I'm lost again. See? That wouldn't happen if we built a money counter. Why would you build one when you can just buy one? Because if we bought one, then we couldn't win the robotics fair with it. Oh, that's a great idea, Mazzi. A money counter is sure to get me... I mean us... first place. - There you go, baby. - Thank you. Okay, come on, you two. We've got to get to the store to get supplies. Oh. Why don't you two go get the supplies while I stay here and... prep our work area? Smart. We can get started faster that way. Come on. - Bye. - Bye. Work area prepped. Okay, Mazzi, it's looking pretty good. You want to test the transistor? Oh, I could do it, but you're so much better at it than I am. How are you gonna learn? I do most of my best learning by watching. You watched me attach the pulley, cut out the frame, attach the roller. If this was an observation class, you'd make an A. I just don't want to mess anything up. How are you gonna explain how this works? Good point. I need directions. Can you write down the steps? No, but you can. I don't have a pen. There's one on my dresser. Okay. Oh, you want me to go get it? Boy, if you don't get your... I got it! Hello? What up, Grayson? Yeah, man, I can talk. My project? Oh, yeah, it's going great. Yeah. Yeah, I got my grandmother to do everything. I'm up here chilling. I wonder if I can get her to do my work when I'm in college. Oh! Thank you. You are all royal. Woo! Wow, new bae has skills. Oh, he's not bae. He's more like may-bae. Shouldn't you be home practicing? It's daytime, shouldn't you be sleeping in your coffin? That's that UK shade. I see you've got your girls talking for you. Too bad they can't sing for you. This next song I want to do is still a work in progress, so I'm gonna need a little help from a dope writer. Jade. Is there another Jade in here? He's talking about her. Come on up here and help me out. Go ahead, Jade. Don't keep bae waiting. I feel like I'm watching A Star Is Born, but with black people. What are you doing? I hope you don't get mad, but I took your poem and I did a little something to it. No, I-I can't. I don't think I can do this. Don't worry about them. Just look at me. - Jade. - Jade. Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Jade! Woo! Woo! Yo, give it up for my girl, Jade! Woo! This money counter is fantastic. - Thank you. - Thank you. Mazzi, I am really impressed you were able to pull this together so fast. Yeah, a little tough love did you good. I'm proud of you, son. So do I get my trophy now or in class on Monday? Oh. Wait, wait, Mazzi. That could have been beginner's luck. Let's crank this baby up and show them what it can really do. Um, but I only brought five dollars. I need some more money. Dad? Oh, yeah, okay. No, no, no. Don't use your dad's money. Mazzi, if you really believe in something, you have to put your own money behind it. - But he said he didn't bring any more. - Well, it's a good thing I thought ahead. While you were creating this masterpiece, I took it upon myself to empty out your piggy bank and get your savings. Aw! M'Dear, that is so sweet. - Okay, let's see what we got. - Mm. Oooh! - My money! - That's not money. That's confetti! Glad it's not my money. Oh, my God! What happened? M'Dear happened. You guys, that song was fire. That hook was all Jade. Thank you for sharing a piece of your soul with us. Stop being weird. I can't believe I just did that. - I got one question for you. - Uh-huh. Are you gonna remember me when you blow up? Of course I will. I'm gonna need somebody to carry my luggage. That's cool. As long as you fly me first class. Um, we'll see about that. Okay, here we go. What do you want, Mikayla? I just want to say... good job. And I can't believe that came out of you. I guess there was a compliment in there somewhere. After hearing that, the G-Club would be happy to call you its newest member. What do you say? I say no. No? I'm cool on my own. Maybe I'll come back here and do another open mic. I seem to have just the right amount of stank for this place. Do you, boo. That's the plan. Now, you know I've been doing a little writing myself. I'm good. - Woke girls. - We out! Enough about them. Let's talk about you two. I can't believe you had the nerve to get M'Dear to do your work for you. Yeah. Where would you get a crazy idea like that from anyway? What? She helped me, but I did most of the work. Okay, some of it. All right, she did all of it. But it wasn't right then and it's not right now. Well, I learned my lesson. I was embarrassed, I got a bad grade and I lost my life savings. Dude, it was 47 dollars. It was still mine! Can I have it back? Oh, sure you can. What am I supposed to do with this? Oh, here's a glue stick. Knock yourself out. - Good luck. - And goodbye. Look... I'll trade you... forty-seven of my dollars... for only ten of your dollars. Okay. Nah, I'm good. See ya. This might have been the best day of my life. Yeah, you killed it. Well, I couldn't have done it without you. Nah, I think you could have. You can do anything. I'm gonna let you stick around. You're my hype man. It's not hype. I know the real deal when I see it. Guess I should go. Oh, Jade, wait. Check this out. Yeah, that's hot. How are you gonna end it? Like this.
