 [laughing] I know you are. I mean, what are you doing here on Earth? What are you doing here? The same thing you're doing. After you, Optimus and the others left Cybertron in search of the allspark, there wasn't much hope left. Those of us left behind continued the fight. A fight we knew we couldn't win. Then the Decepticons discovered the location of the allspark. They think it's here... on Earth. The Decepticon Armada left Cybertron and captured the allspark. And because there was no word from Optimus... Optimus said he would send word, Bee. Why didn't he? He's a complicated guy. I knew I had to get to Earth before the Decepticons got the allspark. And the only way to do that, was through the space bridge. - Space... Bridge! - Yeah, I know. I didn't think the space bridge could be fixed either. But perceptor was finally able to repair it. Still, we couldn't be sure if it would actually work. [sparks exploding] It worked. But it was a one-way trip. I searched the Earth for months for any sign of the allspark. [metal rattling] All I found were Decepticon scouts. Until I found you, Bee. I had no idea the Autobots were on Earth. Totally. I'm so happy to see you. Me too. You're awesome! So, you made it. Where are the others? That's a great question. And the answer is... Optimus and the rest of the crew, where are they, Bee? First, you gotta tell me something. What? Who. Are. You? I'm Windblade the... Are you okay? Nothing wrong with this dealie! Check it out! [engine revving tires screeching] Bee, do you know where the Autobots are? Maybe... Do you know where the allspark is? Could be. Do you remember Cybertron? Eh, what do you think? Do you remember anything? How to do donuts and over 50 different recipes for your microwave oven! Bee, stop doing donuts. Okay, what are we gonna do now? We have to figure this thing out. You really don't remember anything? Bumblebee... Oh, you brought a friend?! Are they staying for dinner? A friend...? Uh... ah! Why are you two so mad at each other? [growls] Ngghh...! Ladies and gentlemen... It's time... to... tango! Huh... ah! Uh! Who's gonna land the big one? I got a feeling somebody's going down here. Ahhhh! Nghhh! [fighting noises] [grunts of exertion] Bumblebee... Hey now, hold on there, fella. [grunts] ♪♪ Bumblebee... Ahhh...! Sorry, partner. Rad! At least you remember your stinger. I got a sting... er! [gnarls] Back... off... Thundercracker. Ahhh! Huh! Ahhh! That was classic! If there's one seeker, there may be more. We need to go. I have an idea that may help us but first, we find somewhere safe. ♪♪ [engine revving] [Windblade] Decepticons! You don't even remember Decepticons? Never trust a Decepticon, because... Well, they're deceptive! Wait, over there. Solid rock makes for good cover. [engine revs] Hey... what is this? It's a hole in the ground. I wanna go in. [sighs] Bee, we're not going in that hole. Sit down. Bummer... Bee, listen carefully. We've known each other a very long time. We're good friends. Do you remember any of that? Yeah. Maybe... no. [sighs] Oh, Primus, help me. Okay, I wanna try something. We Bots record everything we've experienced. It's all there in our memory files. Yours might be a little... scrambled. [sings] ♪ Scrambled, sunny side up! ♪ ♪ Over easy! ♪ ♪ Any way you like it! ♪ Maybe I can find out what's wrong with you. I'm going to enter your mind using this. A cortical psychic patch. Oops, no. That's not right! Sorry. "Let's take a look inside the mind itself." Let me know what you find in there! I've done this before. This won't hurt a bit. [beep] [creaking] Ughhh. Ah! [gasps] [fizzing] Ahhh! [explosion... thud] ♪♪ [music builds] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
