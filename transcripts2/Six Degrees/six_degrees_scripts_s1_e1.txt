 Let me ask you this- Do you think you can fall in love with someone that you don't really know at all? The reason i ask- I live in new york city with almost eight million other people. And i always thought,who knows? The person sitting next to you on the subway could be your soul mate. My point is,the instant before you do meet them,they're a stranger to you, And you to them. Strangers... In this city,an absolute stranger can inspire you. You can walk past the same building every day

 And not even realize that the person who lives there is one day gonna be your best friend... Maybe someone who desperately needs a best friend. A mortar explosion not more than 100 yards away literally shook the ground... It's my favorite thing about new york- You've got some people on top of the world... Others are scraping rock bottom. On any given day,you never know who you're gonna meet. Maybe it'll be someone just trying to clean up their act, As tough as that might be... Or maybe someone living their life with reckless abandon... What is this? Someone trying to lose themselves completely whoo! Oh,my god! But we're all forced together every day...

And not to mention,gerard pinching my ass getting out of that town car. Whit- so,yes,we lost a client, But we avoided a very time-consuming and messy lawsuit, And not sexual harassment. Assault-because he would've done it again,and i would've broken his nose. And we would've been dragged into court, And it would've been "page six" for both of us,and no one wants that. And to be honest... Please. After the year that i have had,i should be having my ass kissed not pinched- La mer,swarovski seriously. - the chanel launch. If we're gonna talk about anything,we should be talking about a promotion. I am promoting you. Do not patronize me. As if that were possible. Whitney! I am promoting you. To? To partner. What?

You got me talkin' to your dispatch to get five minutes with my little brother. How's business? It's cool- the pay is all right,meet a lot of interesting people. Is that right? Seems to me like you more like a servant,a doormat. I tell you what,why don't you come work for me,and i'll pay off that debt? Yeah. No thanks,man. Things have changed,damian. We big time w,bro.

Ladies,your table's ready. Oh,good. I'm sorry,sir. Our only openings are at 5:30 and 11:00. 5:30 or 11:00,that's it? Oh,all right,look,i've met the coolest girl on earth,right? And instead of asking her out for a slice and a beer, I figured i'd have a better shot with, "i got a table at the hottest spot in town. " so... Hello? You gonna get her a corsage? Edie,seriously,get a life. You gotta settle down,all right? Oh,mae,it's carlos- Mr.green- carlos green. Huh,whassup? We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

Isn't it a guy's inalienable right to,like,do the asking? It's 2006. Men marry men. True. But i'd always imagined... Picking out a ring,you know,and... Surprising you.
