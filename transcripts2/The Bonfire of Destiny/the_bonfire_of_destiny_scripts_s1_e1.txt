 Fernand! Mama! Mama! What's going on, darling? My guinea pig is gone. Oh, dear. When did you last see him? Well, before I fed the birds, but when I came back, he wasn't there anymore. Don't worry. We'll find him. He can't have gone far. - Fernand! - Fernand! Fernand! Fernand! Ma'am. His lordship wants you in the music room. I'll be right there.

 He wants to see you right away. Fernand! Very well. Keep looking, dear. I'll be right back. Fernand! You wanted to see me? I need to talk to you. You want a divorce! What? Let go of me. Don't deny it. The attorney told me you asked about the process. There's another man? No, there is no other man. I'm sure there is. Who is it? Let go of me! I'm telling you, there is no other man! Why, then? I stopped loving you long ago. - You're mine. - Let go of me. You're mine for life. You made a vow. I will never let you leave me, do you hear me? Never! To hell with you. I'm supposed to go with Mama. Be quiet and get in. Wait! What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Camille. - Stop it! Mama! - Camille! Don't be ridiculous. What will you do? Run after the horses? You're taking my daughter away! You're a monster! You have no right to do this. As her father, I have every right. You can't keep me from my daughter. I will find her. I'm only fulfilling my duty as a father. I'm sending Camille to an excellent boarding school abroad. Forget this divorce business, and go back to being the person who promised to love me forever. You want to see Camille again? Then get ahold of yourself. And you will do what you are supposed to. You were supposed to go to the Charity Bazaar? Well, you will go. It will be good for my political campaign. It's the biggest charity sale of the year. You're married to the next Senate president. You have to be seen there. I'll drop you off on my way to parliament. The coachman will pick you up around 9 p.m. Buy a lot. And spend a lot. Do me proud. Come! The Bonfire of Destiny - Miss Alice. - Thank you, Jean. See you later. - Wait a minute. - I can't. Miss Alice can wait. Look what I've got. What is it? Our tickets for New York. We leave in a week. So soon? I haven't told Miss Alice yet. You were supposed to talk to her two weeks ago. I know. I haven't been able to. I'm afraid to cause her pain. - It's been 15 years... - Rose, look at me. Do you want to be a maid forever? No. No! I have to go pick up the old man at his club. - See you tonight. - Yes. - And? - I will talk to her. I promise. I love you. Welcome to the Charity Bazaar. In order to make purchases, trade your cash for coupons at the counter located across from the entrance. You will find an orchestra in the Bazaar's right wing that you will be able to reward with tips. All the proceeds will also go to charity. In the left wing, you will be able to see a magician perform, and as a world exclusive, the cinematograph... - Rose! What were you doing? - Nothing. Liar. I saw you with Jean. - You kissed in front of everybody. - True. When you love someone, you can't hold back. You have that with your beau? Of course. You'll get to experience it someday. You'll just have to dare to get closer. Be careful! You're the one who rammed into me. Anyway, you're fine. You could apologize. Apologize for what? For working? Then forgive me for working. Do you even know what work is? Try to be a little more careful next time. You dropped this. So long, Your Highness. "So long, Your Highness." That man is such a cad. Get The Owl! Get The Owl! France has a new cannon. The Germans better behave! Read The Owl! Read The Owl! Kid, here. Keep the change. Thank you. I really don't get what you like about this rag. It's everything you loathe. MEET ME AT 7:15 PM IN FRONT OF THE BAZAAR You like this ship? - Shall I buy it for you? - Certainly not! - Yes, I'll get it. - No. Miss Alice... Thank you. - There you are. - Thank you. - Alice... - The magician's show is starting. The impossible becomes possible. It's wonderful! Hello, Alice. Hello, Odette. I was hoping to run into you. How are you? - Very well. And yourself? - Well. But don't you think it's extremely hot in here? I find it unbearable. It's gorgeous! It's Lartier's latest creation. The princess of Wales has the same. - Is that right? - Mm-hm. - Mama... - Thomas, what's the matter? When are we going back to the cinematograph? There were too many people for us to enter. - Can't we stand in line? - Later, darling. Mama has other things to do. My father set up the cinematograph at the Bazaar. I don't need to stand in line. I could take you with me. Oh, no. I'm replacing my ailing mother at Madame de Tanquerville's booth. - Madame de Tanquerville? - Yes. You're so lucky. It's my dream. Really? Why don't you go on my behalf? You'll offer to replace me. I'll take Thomas to the cinema. - You'd do this for me? - Of course I would. Oh, I'm... Thank you. Thank you. Thomas, darling, you will behave, won't you? Mama will be back soon. See you then, okay? That was scary! It will be okay. Don't be afraid, Thomas. I also thought it was coming at us. I was scared. That's it. It's over. It's awe-inspiring. Don't be scared. It's over. Look, it's cinema. It's the cinematograph. I thought cinema bored you. It does, but I was looking for you. I knew you'd be here. Ladies and gentlemen, please leave the room. It was really great. Glad you liked it, Rose. - Shall we go for a walk? - If you like. We're not watching other films? No, go ahead. I'll look after him since Mr. Julien is here. Thank you. Hello, ladies. - Hello, Madame de Lenverpré. - Here's 30,000 francs. Okay. Thank you, 3000 coupons. - Here you are, ma'am. - Thank you. Enjoy your visit. Hello, Madame de Lenverpré. How are you? Well, Madame de Laferrière. - Your booth looks gorgeous. - We do our best. It's for charity. Would you like this statuette? Yes. A woman symbolizing freedom will do well on my husband's desk. Here. But this is far too much. I insist. I really want to contribute to your foundation for orphans. We'll pray for you. Thank you. Pardon. Excuse me. Pardon. Wait! Here is my aunt. Adrienne! Alice! How lovely! - How are you? - Very well, thank you. And Camille? I haven't seen her in ages. She's well. - Hello, Julien. Lovely to see you. - Hello. Is your mother better? It was only influenza. She's recovering. Good. Give her a kiss for me. See you later. Ma'am? Wait a minute. Wait. Something wrong? My husband kidnapped my daughter. He took my daughter away and sent her abroad. I had no time to say goodbye. Poor thing, she must be so lost. Why did he do that? He found out I had asked about the process for filing for divorce. You want a divorce? Yes. Oh, my, he's got him by the ear! Did you see that? He's really beating him up! What is it? Come on. All is well. No, of course not. Ladies and gentlemen, the situation is under... Go back to having a good time. There is no problem. - Is this your ship? - Yes! Thanks. Are you sure it will be okay? Don't worry. It's a small fire. A few buckets of water will sort it out. The situation is under control. No, sir, there is no problem. The cinema isn't working anymore? - I don't think so, no. - Darn. - Let's go find your mother. - All right. Just a snap of the fingers and you'll fall asleep. Bravo! You are totally under my control. - When I grow up, I want to be a magician. - Excellent idea. Of course, we're going back home. Is there a problem? You should leave. And the catalepsy... Françoise! What are we doing? You'll wait outside with a friend. Because of the fire? What about Mama? I'll go and fetch her. - Could you watch him for five minutes? - Of course. I'll leave this with you. Will you be okay? See you real soon. Is there a problem? Stay here with him. - What's your name? - Thomas. I'm happy with the investment. Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. It's beautiful. It's a great purchase. - Low maintenance? - Excuse me. Absolutely. - It's easy to store? - Of course. - Pardon me. - Rose! Where's Thomas? Alice said he was with you. I thought it best to get him out. A fire started near the cinematograph. - What do you mean, a fire started? - Where's Alice? Over there. Is it serious? You should go to your son. He's out front with the Deplessis' maid. Rose! Excuse me. Pardon. Hold still! There. All done! - You're all right? - Yes. What's going on? Fire! Fire! Miss Alice! There's a fire! We must get out! Take my hand. Move! Step aside! Move! Let me through! There is only one exit, don't block it! Everyone will be able to get out! - Let me out! - Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm!

Thomas! Please, help me! Let me help you. Calm down, don't worry! We can't stay here. We have to go. I'll take you home. - I want to wait for my mama. - Come with me. - I'm sorry, sweetheart. - Mama!

Bring me a sledgehammer, damn it! I've got one. I'll get it. We'll get you out! Hang on! We'll get you out! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Gentlemen, are there people left inside? Yes. The problem is that the door is stuck. We tried to create an opening, but the fire is moving too quickly. There are many injured. Help us move the injured. Nobody should be in front of the façade. Go, go! This way, guys. Bring out the hoses. Quick! Go, go! Here, help me! Get the hose out! Over here! Hurry! Hurry up! Over here! Go back home. Help me, please! Please, my daughter. My daughter! My daughter. I don't want to die! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Help! Help us! Help! Let's go, let's go! Come on, ma'am! Hurry up! Come with me. Go straight ahead. - Straight ahead. - Come on! Julien! Alice! Alice! Julien! Alice! - Rose! - Let go of me! Alice! Alice! Julien! Help! Help! Sir, there's a fire at the Charity Bazaar. - What? - What do you mean? It's a disaster. Everything burned down in 20 minutes. Many people were trapped inside. Alice! Alice. Keep moving. One by one! - Go on! - Mind your head! Don't push behind! Clear the area! It's collapsing! Disconnect the hose! Move the carriages away! I don't want anyone within 100 meters of the façade. - Help me! - Where are you going? - There are people there. - There's nothing we can do for them now. Stand up! Stand up! Run! Hurry! Miss! Miss, can you hear me? Come on. Stay with me. Stay with me! Listen to me. Miss! Miss! Miss, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you walk? I'll get you out. This way! Come this way!

He's hurt. Doctor! It's not too bad. You need to go to the hospital. Help him take his jacket off. What are you doing? I have to help them! - Stay here! - There are more people! No! - You can't go! - No! It's dangerous. Let me through! It's too dangerous. - Her name is Louise. - Clothilde! It's Louise. Do you understand? Clothilde! - Clothilde! - Come, she's been found. Please! Rose! Rose! Rose! Julien. Have you seen Alice and Rose? They were with me. Where are they now? I was holding Alice's hand, but we got separated. I can't remember where... And Rose? Where is she? Where was she when you split up? Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Adrienne? Why are you here? I should have been at the Bazaar. I could have been among these poor souls. We're all quite upset right now. He must be worried sick. You really should go home. No! I can't live with him. He's a monster. He'll keep Camille from me forever. However, if he believes I'm dead... that changes everything. Translation by Catherine Kelsey-Homayoun Banifatemi
