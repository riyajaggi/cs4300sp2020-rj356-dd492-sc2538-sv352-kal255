 Do you know Mr. Anukul's family? -The high court judge? -Yes. I know him. I have met him a few times. I used to work for him, since his father's time. You could say that, Mr. Anukul and I grew up together. I had no experience of work, sir. I learnt everything over there. It was my first job. -Are you Raicharan? -Yes. Now, you have to stay in this mansion. Your accommodation has been arranged for.

 But sir, what do I have to do? Do? Nothing. You just have to play. Father says, I just have to work. Your job is to play. I have a son, who is as old as you. You have to play with him. You will do that, won't you? Yes, sir. -Bhola. -Yes, sir. -Show him to his room. -Yes, sir. Go, son. The master explained my work so simply.. ..that, I didn't feel as if, I am in an unfamiliar place. I started fulfilling the responsibility..

 ..that my master gave me. I was always with the master's son. At times as a servant, at times as a friend. We were growing up together. Thus, time passed by. The young master finished his studies in the college.. ..and started his law practice. I would also help him with his office work. But, there was a limit to it. Somebody else was meant to come into his life. My son, look at this photo. Let me see it, mother. -She's nice. -Nice? Yes. -What are you doing? -Sir, she is very beautiful. If she comes into our house, our family will flourish. -Do you like her? -Yes. In that case, I like her, too. Come on. We will burst crackers. We will burst crackers. He got married with great pomp. The young master's wife replaced.. ..me in his life. -Raicharan. -Yes, ma'am. I will massage him. Okay. She started taking care of his smallest need. At times as his maid, at times as his wife. Thank you. I started being alienated from his life. There was emptiness in my life. But, before I could feel neglected.. ..God bestowed another boon on me. Raicharan. You have taken care of me so lovingly and dedicatedly, till now. From today, you have to take care of him. Little master. Little master. You have come into my life, like a messiah. I will take very good care of you.. ..and I won't allow anything to happen to you! Yes. I will nurture you and raise you. I will keep you close to me. Yes. My little master. Who am I? -Father. -Father. Okay. Who is she? -Mother. -Mother. And who is he? Channa. What? What did you say? -Channa. -Channa? -He called you Channa. -Did you hear, that? -You are his father. -Yes. She is his mother. But, I am Rai Channa! Who am I? Rai Channa! The little master has called me, Channa. Channa! From today, my new name is Channa. The little master has.. Catch. Catch. Catch Channa. Catch Channa. Little master, come. Come. Catch Channa. Ma'am, did you see this? He takes each step, so cautiously! He always takes the right step. He will go far. He will be a very successful man. He will be a judge. Right? I hope, that comes true, Raicharan! Don't spoil him too much or he will give his wife a tough time, later. No. No. No. He won't trouble anyone, ma'am. -Come. Come. -Channa. My master has been transferred to another district. He will leave in a few days. He will leave. But, I am wondering, what about.. ..the little master? I mean, who will take care of him? How will he live without me? So, I will have to go along with him. So, go. Who has stopped you? Go, wherever you want to go. Don't get angry. Try to understand. If I don't get angry, what else should I do? Tell me, sister. Earlier, I had hoped, that.. ..you will return home in the evening. Now, I have lost that hope, too. Why are you getting angry? You've stopped fanning me! Brother, she is bound to get angry. Do think about your house and your wife, at times. She is pregnant. It's her third month. You will have to take care of her, too. So, what? You are there. You can handle it. I will have to stay with my little master. You will handle it. I know that. After a long time, it is not raining, right? -Yes. -It's not raining. -We will go.. -Yes. -..to the river. -Yes. -We will play a lot. -Yes. We will go there. We will play a lot. Okay? It will be great fun. It will be great fun. We will run and jump over there. We will see a monkey, too! Come on. Over the stones. Over the stones. Fruit. Channa, fruit. I will pluck the fruit for you. -But, you don't move. -Okay? -Okay? -Yes. Wait. -Sit here. Don't move. -Okay. Little master, don't move at all. I will go and bring the fruit for you. -Okay? -Yes. Little master, don't move. Okay? -Stay right there. -Yes. Little master! Little master! Little master! Little master! Little master! Little master! Master. Little master. Where did you go? Little master. Little master. I have brought the fruit. Little master. Little master. Little master.. Master. Master. Little master. Master! Little master! Little master. Little master. He insisted on having the fruit. But, I.. Where is my child? -So what, if he had cried? -Where did you hide him? What did you do to my child? What did you do to him? Where is my child? Ma'am. -Take her inside. -Where is my child? Let's go inside. Where is my child? -Ma'am, calm down. -My child. -Your son will come back. -Return my child to me. -My child. -I shouldn't have gone. -I should have stayed there. -Return my child to me. I should have played with him. I should have taken care of him. I am the older one. Why did I do this? What is this, ma'am? My jewelry. Keep it. -No, ma'am. -I beg of you. Return my child to me. -What are you doing? -Return my child to me. -Take this. Do you want more? -No. -Take this. Take this too. -Ma'am. -Keep it. -No. -Keep it. -No. No. No. -Return my child to me. -No. -Keep it. -No. -Return my child to me. -I shouldn't have gone. -I want my child back. -I shouldn't have left him. -Keep it. -What are you doing? What happened? What happened to him? Nothing is hidden from a mother. -He has stolen my child. -Listen to me. I am giving him my wealth and ornaments. Return my child. Return my child. Why would he commit such a serious crime, without a reason? -What are you saying? -I don't know that. He was wearing so much gold. That's why, my child.. Take this. Take more gold. Return my child to me. -Listen. -Tell him to return my child. Just tell this wretched man to go away! Where will he go? Where will he go? Come here. Come inside. Come inside. Nothing is up to human beings, sir. Time is very powerful. In the blink of an eye, everything changes. See, I lost everything in a moment. Sir, it is evening. I've wasted a lot of your time. If you say so, some other time.. No. Not some other time. Tell me, now. What happened next? After leaving my master's house, I had only one place to go. My village. Somehow, I picked up the pieces of my life. But, destiny had to play another game with me. ..I was confronted with the memories.. ..I was running away from. That's it. It's almost over. Be strong. Be strong. -He is here. -Take the hot water. She is in a lot of pain. -The baby is stuck. -Oh, my God! Where did Raicharan go? I did my best. Oh, Lord! Congratulations. It's a boy. Great! He is so handsome. It's a boy. It's a boy. Where is brother? They are celebrating the baby's birth. I don't have any child. I had only one child. The little master. Because of me.. Little master. Where were you the whole night? Do you even know, what's happening in the house? Sister-in-law is in a critical condition. She has become very weak. She can't even nurse the baby. See, I got goat's milk for the baby. Are you even listening? I think, I will have to cook to feed myself. Drink the milk. There is no cigarette at home. Where did I keep it? I kept it somewhere. The cigarette.. Madhu. What happened, brother? This is the last straw. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. What did you name the baby? I didn't, sir. Madhu christened him. Phelna. I couldn't understand anything. A little child lost his life, because of my mistake. It was so difficult to forget that. Why was God giving me another child? I denied his existence and I was always drunk. But then, one day something happened.. ..that shook me up, completely. Hey! Go inside. Hey! Go inside. Go inside. Channa. Channa. You called me, Channa! Little master. Little master. Little master, it's you? You have returned to me, little master! And I couldn't recognize you! I couldn't recognize you, little master. I am free of my guilt. You called me Channa. Little master has forgiven me. Little master has forgiven me. Little master has forgiven me. Little master has forgiven me. -Why are you calling him little master? -Little master.. ..has gone to sleep, Madhu. God works in divine ways. I have personally witnessed God's grace at work! Which grace? Doing what? I was very unjust to Phelna. What can I do? I am dimwitted. I had lost my mind. But now, I will fix everything, Madhu. I don't understand. Little master has been reincarnated in our family, as Phelna. Madhu, look. Look, he was born.. ..a few days after the little master's death. Isn't it? But, how is that possible? This is what has happened. Look! The same smile. The same eyes. The same capriciousness. He was calling me, Channa. Channa. Just like the little master used to call me. Is there any other greater proof? No, there isn't. Ma'am was right. I stole the little master. See? He was found in my house. Madhu, I am liberated of my guilt. The little master has forgiven me. Little master, see what I got from the market. -Wow! -Wow! Look at this. Look at this horse. Look. Here you are, sir. My wife's ornaments. Move. Move. Move from here. Don't come near. He is my little master. Don't come near the little master. Stay within your limits. Move. No. No. No. Little master. I wonder, what madness has gripped Raicharan. He calls him, God's gift. And he worships him like God. I wonder, what drug he is on? You are right. Every child is God's gift. So, is he. But after all, he is an ordinary child. Let him grow up like one. The little master is not ordinary. How can I let him grow up, just like that? No. No. No. I will send the little master to a posh school. In Kolkata. We are going to Kolkata. That will be very costly. Yes. I know. That's why, I sold my land. I will sell everything else, too. Wait and watch. I will find a job in Kolkata. Don't worry. But, I will give the little master a good upbringing. Say it. Say it, little master. Channa. Channa. Did you see? Did you see? You don't believe me. Fine. He has got admission. But, how are you related to him? He is my master's son. There was a flood and his parents drowned. How will you pay the school fees? Don't worry about that. My master has left a lot of wealth. Don't worry about that. Little master, study hard. You want to be a judge, don't you? Phelna. I mean, the little master is now 18 years old, sir. -What? -Yes, sir. How did you pay his fees for 18 years? You don't earn so much from this job. I sold whatever I had, sir. I survived on meager meals. But now, I have nothing left. I have to arrange for money for Madhu's medicines, too. That's the problem, sir. But, I can't let anything fall short.. ..in little master's upbringing and education, sir. I can't. But, the situation is getting worse. The other day, when I went to meet the little master.. ..Madhu was also with me. Phelna, your servant is here. And today, there is a lady with him, too. -Brother. -Yes. Hello, little master. When will you stop calling me little? I have grown up, now. Yes. Okay, listen. I want a new watch. You got a new watch, just last year! That watch has become old, now. The fashion has changed. Buy me a new one. My name should be engraved on it. It will be done. It will be done. I will buy you a new watch. Don't worry. Tell me. How are you doing in studies? I am doing well at studies. What else can I tell you? You are illiterate. You are right. How can I understand? I will get the watch. I will get the watch. Don't worry about the watch. Study well.. You did so much for him. You lost everything. But, he is not concerned about you or me. How can you endure so much humiliation? He should know the truth. Whether you tell him or I tell him. Listen, it is the children's duty to look after.. ..their elders, when they are old. And.. ..he is just exploiting us. I can't do all this, now. All this.. Madhu, drink this. -Drink it. -Yes. It will give you some relief. -Hold it from below. It's hot. -Yes. Carefully. Drink it. -What have you decided? -About what? Will you tell Phelna or should I tell him? You won't say anything to anyone. I raised him like my own child. I will tell him whatever I want! If you want to stop me, then kill me. Sir, I have decided. This can't go on. What have you decided? What will you do? I don't know whether, what I have decided will happen or not. That's why, I can't tell you, now. But, I am going to do something.. ..for which I need a few days' leave, sir. Fine. Go. I sanction your leave. But, I believe, Madhu has given you sound advice. You have dragged it out for too long. I don't know, what you want to do. But whatever you want to do, this should end here. Because, this is best for all. Thank you, sir. I pray to God, that He should sort out my dilemma. I will leave now, sir. That's a hefty price for a herb! Ma'am, people pay handsomely for this herb. As such, God has given you everything. This herb can give you, what you don't have. Fine. Give it to me. Young master. Raicharan, it's you? You? Ma'am. Why have you come here? You were right, ma'am. It wasn't the Goddess Padma.. ..in fact, I had taken your child. What? I stole him. Where is he? Where is my child? Where is my child? Little master. Our son. Should I give you more, son? Young master, I have something to say. If you permit it, I will work for you, again. I mean, I will take care of the little master. How dare you say that? Aren't you content, after deceiving us once? Ma'am! Ma'am, believe me. I was just the means to an end. What happened was God's will. Did God tell you to steal our child? No. No, ma'am. Young master, it's not my fault. It's the fault of my fate. You committed the crime, Raicharan. It wasn't God or destiny. Young master, I raised the little master like this family's son. I gave him whatever he wanted. I never refused him anything. Don't separate me from him, master. Don't separate me from him. -Go away, Raicharan. Get lost. -I beg of you. I implore you, young master. Let me just meet him once in one or two months, sir. No, Raicharan. Now, you can never come to this house. -Go away. -Young master, listen to me. I will watch him from a distance, young master. I beg of you. Father. Raicharan is right. He looked after me, for so many years. If you give him some money, he won't insist on seeing me. Channa. Channa. Channa. Channa. He fell down. He fell down. He fell down. He fell down.
