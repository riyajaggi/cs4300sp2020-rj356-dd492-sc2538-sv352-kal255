 Stories by Rabindranath Tagore (2015): Season 1, Episode 5 - Maanbhanjan - full transcript 
 Giribala, a beautiful, young wife of a wealthy, spoiled Zamindar son, Gopinath, secretly went to watch a play in the nearby theatre. Giribala and Gopinath had a loving, romantic relationship when they got married. But soon Gopinath fell out of love and started seeing a glamorous theatre actress, Latika. The charm of Giribala's youth and beauty could not keep Gopinath in the house. So along with a faithful maid Sudha, Giribala went to see the reason of her husband's aloofness. The play 'Maan Bhanjan' started with glimmering lights and magical songs. 'Radha' is angry, and 'Krishna' is trying to convince her by surrendering himself to her feet. The play finished but Giribala was enthralled. She imagined herself as Radha, and Gopinath as Krishna. She decided she will make Gopinath fall at her own feet one day. One night Gopinath came to the house and asked for the key of the vault as he needed some money. Giribala was hurt and angry that despite Gopinath has come after a long time, he is ignoring her completely. She refuses to give the key. An angry and frustrated Gopinath beats up Giribala, snatches all her ornaments from her and left the house. Eventually Gopinath eloped with the seductive actress Latika. Few months later, Gopinath heard that a beautiful new actress has emerged in the theater circle and she has taken the place of Latika. Curiuos, Gopinath went to see the play. The curtains rose. Gopinath was baffled as in front of him, it was, his wife Giribala, dazzling the stage as gorgeous 'Radha'.

 Or did he insult me on purpose in the royal court? Very good. Wow! Tara.. Where is your sister? She is upstairs and she is waiting for you. I will beat you. Can I come in? Since when do you need permission, to come inside? Please, come in. I will have to ask for permission. I am not here to meet an ordinary person. I have come to meet an artist. Okay, so you are making fun of me.

 Well, I could say, you've robbed me of my bliss, my peace.. ..my contentment and everything else. What are you doing? Let me go. Someone may come here. I don't care if anyone comes. I am not scared of anyone. Let me go! I don't like it, when others look at you. Do you feel jealous? No, I feel like I am on fire. Are you telling the truth? If you call it a fire, what do you call this? You tell me. I was married into this family at a very young age. We were fine, at that time. We used to play, laugh and everybody was happy. Father used to love me a lot. But after father's death, he became the head of this house. And everything changed, gradually. He started spending more time outside, than at home. He didn't behave like that, earlier. Sometimes, we used to talk, until it was evening. We never realized, that time had passed by. There was so much to talk about. Talk about the day. Talks about the school and friends. Do you know, he used to steal pickle for me? Jujube pickle. Do you see that mango tree? We use to hide the pickle jar under it. Why? Did father scold you? No, father never scolded me. Father loved me a lot. After his death.. ..everything changed. I lost my childhood friend, after he passed away. That was in your childhood. Back then, you did not even understand the meaning of marriage. But now, Dada Babu has to fulfill his duty as a husband. Sister, can I say something? I hope, you will not feel bad. I don't like it, when Dada Babu does not come back home. Shudho is busy. It is not that easy to be a landlord. "The night.." "The night.." "The night.." "The night.." Wow! That was amazing. Don't touch me, Prince. I've had enough of your games. What else do you want from me? The Gods and his angels are my witness, Anarkali.. ..that I have not played any games with you. In fact, I have loved you. Enough, Prince. That's enough. It doesn't seem right when you speak of pure things, like love. You took advantage of my love and desire. My body and soul is crazy for you, Latika. Latika? Did you hear that? Latika.. Hey, it was just a slip of the tongue. It's just a slip of the tongue. Latika.. Why didn't you come home last night? If I keep sitting at home, then who will work? You know, how busy I am. If you work so much, then don't you think.. ..your body needs to rest? At least, come home to sleep. You have started off, again! You forget, that you are the wife of a landlord. Being a landlord is not easy. You have to work hard for it. Is that why you go to the theatre, every night? I get tired after working all day. And I need peace, which I can never find in this house. That is why, I go to the theatre. Do you have any problem with that? Take this money and be careful. Don't let Dada Babu and his friends see you at the theatre. Sister, you don't have to make such a big deal of this. Everything is going on well. What is going on well? I cannot close my eyes like a pigeon and believe.. ..that everything is going on well. Until I find out about that Latika, I won't rest in peace. She is very strange. She is ugly. She is not beautiful, at all. If she was walking outside, I wouldn't even notice her. I don't know, what people like about her. And when she sings, her voice sounds as if someone is crying in pain. What else can I tell you about her? You know, half the theatre was empty! I don't know why people appreciate her so much. I will never go back there, again. Can I ask you something? Why are you so beautiful? -What happened? -I don't know. Mother says, that I have been like this, since childhood. You are very proud of your beauty. I am not proud, dear. This is confidence. -Confidence? -Yes. I know, what I am. Really? Then, tell me who you are. I am the best actress of this era. Wow!! That is great. Should I tell you, what I think about you? Certainly, you can tell me. You are someone who easily pleases the heart, mind and soul. Is that the truth? Exactly. I can do anything for you. Anything? Just say the word. Think it over. What if, I ask for anything? Check it out. Are you sure? Set up another play for me. What are you looking at? It will only cost you some money, that's all. Let me think. You don't have to think about it so deeply. It is a very measly amount, for a rich man like you. Should I talk to the manager about it? You are really bad. All because of you.. ..I am going to get scolded, today. Manager, you have to remember.. ..this new play must be the biggest production of the year. It must be a blend of art and music.. ..which will astound everyone who watches it. Do not worry about money. I will take care of that. Just make sure that your troupe.. ..has the best actors and singers. -Do you understand? -Mr. Gopi, please don't worry. I will set up a play that everyone will talk about.. ..for many years to come. All right, we shall see. Sister, I think you still have time. Let's go back. Are you crazy? Whenever there is a mention of the beloved.. ..God is always near them. Those who have the treasure of love.. ..can never be called poor. Presenting, Laila Majnu. Nature has beautified you with her hands. That is why I like to keep watching you. "My arms are open for you.." "..my beloved." There is only beauty on this pretty face. I just want to be lost in the worship of it. "What magic is this?" No one else will be able to touch me. I feel like saying that after touching you. "My arms are open to you, my beloved." "My arms are open to you, my beloved." Wow! That was amazing. Applaud for them. Latika, that was amazing. Very good. Amazing. Let's have a big round of applause. Latika, that was amazing. Hey, how dare you? You have made a terrible mistake. How could you dare to do this? I will cut off the hand, with which you touched her. "Why am I missing the times that have gone by?" "Why do I think of the sad stories and weeping songs?" Oh God, swear upon the bride of hopes and wailing of widows.. ..and swear upon my love. Oh, God, save me from doom. Save the hapless woman from her lover's cruelty. Now, I have become a widow and.. ..I don't need any jewelry. Cover me with a black shroud, under the blue sky. Giribala. "Why do you love me so much?" Giribala. "Why do you trouble me so much, Lord Krishna?" "Why do you trouble me so much, Lord Krishna?" Give me the keys. Please, sit down. Did you hear me? I need the keys. You will get them. I will give them to you. Just stay back for one night. Where are the keys? Where are they? I will give you the keys and every treasure that opens with it. Just stay back for one night. My heart is yearning to spend some time with you. You don't want to see me, talk to me or touch me. Have you gone crazy? Tell me, where are the keys? "Why do you love me so much?" -I will not give you the keys. -What? -I will not give the keys. -You won't give me the keys? You won't give me the keys? Tell me, where are the keys? Tell me. You won't give the keys to me, right? "Why do you trouble me so much, Lord Krishna?" Won't you give the keys to me? Keep the keys with you. Let me take these away from you. "Leave me.." So, you won't give me the keys, right? "Let go of my wrist." "Don't pelt me with pebbles, today." "Why do you trouble me, so much, Lord Krishna?" "Why do you trouble me, so much, Lord Krishna?" "My anklets are making melodious sounds." "My anklets are making melodious sounds." "Let the night go on, slowly." Ms. Latika.. No. It is not nice. Do it again. -Do it again. -Just a minute. "My anklets are making melodious sounds." "My anklets are making melodious sounds." "Let the night go on slowly." You don't have to move your hands around so much! It's over emotional. Tone it down a bit. Go on, do it again. "My anklets are making melodious sounds." What are you doing, Ms. Latika? That's not what acting is all about. Go on and do it again. "My anklets are making melodious sounds." "My anklets are making melodious sounds." "Let the night go on slowly.." "My anklets are making melodious sounds." "Let the night go on slowly.." Concentrate, Ms. Latika. You're not focussing. Latika.. One moment, sir. I will be back soon. Ms. Latika, the rehearsal is not over yet. Sir, I just need a moment. Exactly! It only takes a moment. You can't dance. We have been trying since 10 days. You do not realize how valuable every minute can be. This time, belongs to me. Come on. Come here and perform. You're wrong. Both of you owe your time to me.. ..since, I am the producer of this play. You may be the producer, when you invest the money.. ..and collect money from the box office. But, I am the director at this rehearsal. The producer is not needed here. Only the director and the actors are needed here. As far as I know, I own this land and the building on it. And I own your leading lady, too. Listen, I don't know if this place belongs to you or not. But, this is my rehearsal. And I doubt that, the one you refer to as an actress.. ..is still an actress. Latika, are you interested in getting insulted.. ..by this worthless man, all your life? Who are you calling worthless? I am not talking to you. Or would you like to live your life respectably with me? The decision is up to you. Come on, let's get on with the rehearsal. Let's take it from the top. Come on, Ms. Latika. Come on, let's begin. Till when? Lifetime. You are talking about a lifetime.. ..but, you could not give me a moment. Ms. Latika, a moment is precious.. ..and you are wasting it. I can give you all the time you want and relieve you of this play. Go on. Sister. Sister, eat your food. Sister, how long can you stay, without eating? You must not stay hungry. Sister, eat something. "Dear, untie the tangles in my hair." "Dear, untangle the knots in my hair." See? I've got a sore throat due to the cold. How will I sing, if I have a sore throat? Who asked you to sing? I like your voice the way it is. You need not entertain anyone else. From today, you will sing only for me. Only for me. Where are you going, sister? I am going to my house. What do you mean by, your house? This is your house. After marriage, a girl's in-laws' house is her home. Shudho, I cannot stay here for another moment. Call for the carriage, quickly. What is it? MIRABAI'S EXCELLENT STAGING Meerabai. I was going to perform in that play, right? Meerabai? Do you want to portray a nun? Why? It would give me a chance.. ..to display my singing talents along with acting and dancing. Listen, nobody wants to watch these small time plays, anymore. You are so beautiful. Why do you want to present yourself.. ..in the role of a foolish woman? I don't like any of this. Don't I take care of you? No, it's not about that. Actually, a new actress has been cast in this play. She is getting such good reviews! Everyone says, that she is amazing. And if I would have performed in this play.. ..All this appreciation would have been for me. Everyone would have called me amazing. You are just getting jealous, that's all. Mr. Gopi, you have no idea.. ..how much the echo of applause matters to an artist. Latika. The lawyer wrote from Kolkata. I have to go. All right. I'll get your things packed. No, it's all done. Niranjan will take care of you. I'm going to give him some money. Tell him, if you need anything. Really? Then, tell him to book me a ticket, too. I'm coming along with you. Why? I'm not going away, forever. We didn't come here to settle down, forever. You were going to set up a new play for me. Time is passing by. I don't want to go past my prime. I don't want you to lose your admirer. That's nice, Mr. Gopi. You can't set up a play.. ..and so, you're issuing threats, now. Gopinath doesn't issue threats. Why are you doing this? I want to go to Kolkata and see who replaced me. Spoken like a true blue courtesan. All for a worthless play. You may think the play is worthless, Mr. Gopi. All you did was pay for the price of a ticket. I've given my entire life to it. Wait here. I'll fetch the tickets. Two tickets, please. Mr. Gopi! It's been so long since I've seen you. How are you? How is 'Meerabai' doing? It's been running housefull since 10 weeks. 10 weeks? Who is playing the lead role? You know, Mandira Devi. Mandira Devi? "He is mine.." "Lord Krishna is mine and no one else." "Lord Krishna is mine and no one else." "Crown with a peacock feather on the head.." "Crown with a peacock feather on the head.." "Crown with a peacock feather on the head" "My true love." "Lord Krishna is mine and no one else." "Lord Krishna is mine and no one else." Don't go any closer! Hold him back! Get him out of here! "Lord Krishna is mine and no one else." "Lord Krishna is mine and no one else." Please go away from here. Don't point at me! You set up the theater with my money. -Go away! I said, go away. -Get away from me! -Giribala! -What about Giribala? -Let me go! -Go away. Who do you think you are? You came begging to me for money. -I will show you.. -Stop bossing me around! I will not let you in! Who are you to allow me in? I will go where I please! -I'll thrash you! It's my wife. -Back off! -Get away from here! -My wife is in there! You cannot make me sit here, like this. Giribala is my wife! Her name is Giribala and I am Gopinath. I am a landlord. You can't just pick up anyone like this. -I will file a case against you. -Quiet. Not another word! You will file a case, it seems! Listen, you are mistaken. I am from an elite family.. ..and not some needy man, who has walked in. I would never do anything that amounts to misbehavior. {\an8}Have you heard the name of Jack the Ripper? Sir, you have nabbed the thief, so cleverly! Great. Thief? You have a fine sense of humor, sir. Total waste of time. It would have been better, if I had stayed home. I have not gone home, since two days. I wonder, what Neelu will say? Neelu, I left my house to live with you. I left my brothers and sisters. I just want you to be happy. I praise your food, too. I wear the clothes that you like. Who else do I have time for, apart from you? I am at work, all day long. I don't mind anyone, apart from Harimati. But, is she the only woman at the police station? Now tell me.. ..if more women work at the police station, will you.. Are more women going to work there? How would I know? The government has to decide that. I will have to accept it. Harimati is a very smart woman. She is really strong willed. Neelu, she is smart and strong willed.. ..that is why, the government hired her for the job. Listen to me. You won't speak to her, at all! I have two goals in my life. To be a detective and reveal the greatest secrets. And secondly, be the husband of a very beautiful woman. Don't worry. I do not talk to Harimati, at all. Now, infamously known as Bonnie and Clyde of cigar smoking fame. Harimati.. If you weren't married, I'd have eloped with you. Where is the file on the Mallik Bazaar case? Even before the matter is presented for consideration.. ..Gandhi might have already.. There's news about Mallik Bazaar. Forget about it. Why are you reading all this? It is about you. Please, listen. In an act of sheer brilliance, the government detective.. ..at the Chatterjee residence, did not only solve the case.. ..within few hours, but also nabbed the criminals, instantly. I did not ask any question and he accepted his crime. And they call themselves, criminals! Fools! The detective on duty, Mohan Chand.. Mohan.. Good, it is better than my name appearing in print.
