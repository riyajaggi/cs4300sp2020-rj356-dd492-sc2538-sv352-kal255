 "The bee floats from flower to flower." "Alas, it finds peace nowhere." "It looks into the eyes of its beloved.." "..the crazy guy is named a romantic." "The love that shimmers in her eyes, appeals to him." "We the stricken ones.." "..Overcome by grief, quietly shed tears." "It leaves us crying, the bee." "Finds joy for itself." "Who does it sing for?" "All the jibes are false."

 "Who does it sing for?" "All the jibes are false." "What does the lover know.." "..About the flame of love?" "It tries to touch, the bee.." "It flies away once allowed." "It hums its own tune, trying to hide from sight." "Singing a ballad of love." "Though troublesome, yet appealing.." "..are the pranks of this charlatan." "If only it becomes mine, the bee.." "..and not go anywhere." "The bee floats from flower to flower." "Alas, it finds peace nowhere."

 It's really beautiful, sister-in-law. What can I say? There are so many things, I want to say. But, I don't have words. Really? Yes. Accept my unspoken compliments. Brother, I will pay the paper vendor and settle his account.. ..and take the receipt. Yes. That is fine. But tell him, that henceforth we will take it on credit.. ..and make the payment, later. Yes. He will give credit, too. Once he starts trusting us, he will give us credit, too. Fine. Amol, sit. Yes. -Brother. -Yes. You gave him so much money. Is it safe? He won't take it, openly. He will take it, covertly. No. I mean, is he trustworthy? He is Charu's brother. Okay. What brings you here? Oh yes, brother. I almost forgot. Sister-in-law's knowledge of music and her talent is exceptional. I want to take her to All India Radio. The station director has become my friend. If he hears sister-in-law's song, I am certain.. ..he will give her a chance to sing on the radio. -Great! -Brother, I just need your permission. Do you need my permission? Ask your sister-in-law. If she wants to go, you can surely take her. It's out of the question. Sister-in-law, just come with me once. My songs are my own. I won't sell them in the market. And I want to keep my things safe with me. -I am not like you. Everybody.. -Sister-in-law. I know, you are angry with me. But, I didn't have any other option. He didn't like any other song. I would have lost this opportunity. Sister-in-law, that song was only for you. I swear. Are you going fishing? -Yes. -Can I come, too? Manda, if both of us go, who will look after the house? Please stay back. You are here! Listen. I wanted to speak to you. Charu isn't doing the right thing. Bhupati is trying to do the right thing. That's why, he called Amol. So that, he can teach Charu music. -Amol and Charu are.. -Listen. It is best, that you don't interfere in all this. Will you help me? Tell me. Will you tell a little lie for me? A lie? What kind of a lie? Don't ask any questions. Tell me. Will you lie for me? You are too much! I can tell a thousand of lies for you. It's delicious. Here you are. I have brought the sweet curd. -You have brought it. -Wow! Amazing! -Do you want some more lentils? -Do you like the fish? It's very fresh. It's very delicious. It's bound to be fresh. After all, Charu and Amol caught it this morning. -Is that so? -Yes. How do you catch a fish? It's not easy to bait a fish. The fish swims against the current. You need to throw the hook, where the current is low.. ..to catch the fish. You shouldn't pull it out, immediately. You need to reel it in, slowly. That's how you catch a fish. Isn't it? Amol. Did you teach your sister-in-law, what I taught you? Brother, knowledge increases by sharing it, isn't it? I would also learn to make betel nut leaf from sister-in-law Manda. Umapati, what time is your train, tomorrow? At 5 o'clock. You didn't tell me. Where are you going? Well.. My mother is gravely ill. So, we are going to my parent's house. Is that so? You didn't tell me. How could I tell you, Charu? You are busy with something else. You don't have time to listen to anyone. -Give us our money. -Where is Umapati? When will we get our money? You owe us money. Where is Umapati? He went to his village last night. But, what is the matter? I gave you paper to print your newspaper. But, he didn't pay me. I think, that's why you made him disappear. How is that possible? I gave him money to pay all of you. He said, all of you have stopped giving credit. I have been making everybody's payment. What payment? You haven't paid a single penny. Mr. Bhupati, we will call the police. You will go to prison. No. No need to call the police. I will settle your accounts. Show me your account books. See this. It's a hefty amount. It will take some time to settle it. Listen, we will give you two days. If we don't get our money, within two days.. ..we will have to call the police. Come on, brothers. Brother. Brother. Amol. Is everything all right, brother? You were right, Amol. I trusted the wrong man. Umapati turned out to be a big fraud. He took money from me, but, he didn't pay anyone a penny. He amassed so many creditors. I will have to sell everything, to repay their debts. The newspaper has shut down, Amol. Brother, don't lose hope. Umapati must have gone to Manda's village, right? We will send the police to nab him. Don't worry. Come with me. I bet, he has not gone to Manda's village, Amol. It was just an excuse, to get out of here. He must have escaped somewhere else, with the money. It's futile to search for him. It's okay. I toiled for so many years, I put the ancestral property at stake.. ..and started my newspaper business. In an instant, everything was finished. It's okay. I will do it, again. Come on. Brother, you have courage. The man who can smile, even under such circumstances.. ..will never lose. Brother, does sister-in-law know? No. Don't tell your sister-in-law, anything. Her elder brother cheated me so badly. She won't be able to endure this. -Then, what, brother? -What? Nothing. Amol, even after all that happened.. ..at least, I have the faith that Charu is with me. If she is with me, I can do anything. I can make a new beginning and win again. Come on. What are you doing? Writing songs? Please, sing something for me. No. Not now. Today, I won't doze off. No. The song is still not ready. Later. Charu, sing anything. I really want to hear something. No. I will sing it once I finish it. Okay? I will bring you some tea. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law, did brother say anything to you? What can he say? He is always busy with his work. Sister-in-law, he must have said something. He must have said something, about his problem. As to what has happened, and why he is so worried. Problem? What problem? I don't think, he is worried. Anyway, what problem could he have? Another newspaper must have criticized him. What else? Okay, listen. I have written a new song. Would you like to hear it? Sister-in-law, do you know where Umapati.. ..and sister-in-law Manda have gone? They have gone to their village. Forget that. Listen to my new song. The tea is getting cold. Shall I serve it? Yes. I have received a marriage proposal for Amol from Bardhaman, again. Where is Amol? Amol. Amol. Why are you so bothered? You know his answer. Since I have got the proposal.. ..I should at least ask him, before refusing. Whether they send him to London or to the moon.. ..Amol is not ready for marriage. I know. Yes, brother? -Amol, come. Will you have tea? -No. It's okay. I have received a marriage proposal for you from Bardhaman, again. What shall I say? Shall I say, yes? Say yes, brother. You are making the right decision, Amol. If you have decided, what are you waiting for? Get married quickly and go abroad. I'll do whatever you think is fine. So, I will write to him and fix everything, at once. Why are you doing all this? What are you running away from? You are such a fool, Amol. What do you think? Will you forget about all this, by losing yourself in studying law? If you become a lawyer, will you be able to distance yourself.. ..from music and the memories attached to it? Can you separate music from yourself? You have gone crazy. You can still reject this marriage proposal. You can still tell your brother, that you don't want to go anywhere. Why don't you understand, Amol? You want to go. You want to go. You want to go. As if, you have made up your mind! Will you be able to leave all this? Don't go, Amol. I have made up my mind, sister-in-law. What have you made up your mind about? You don't have the sense to think! You thought only about yourself. But, what about me? Don't go, Amol. Don't go, for my sake. Sister-in-law. I am leaving. Charu. Charu, open the door. Charu, we are leaving. Okay. Take care. This is the problem with women. They don't say anything, directly. They simply close the door and cry. This is how, they express their grief. She will be all alone, once you leave. Live a good life. Take good care of yourself. Come on. Charu, what are you doing here, alone? Why did you give up music? When you and Amol used to sing.. ..I would sit in office and listen to both of you. I used to love that. I know that you don't believe me, Charu. But, what could I do? Since, I was the only son of the family.. ..I had to quit music and handle all the responsibilities. When I was six years old, my grandfather taught me a melody. I will play it for you. Did you hear that? I played it well, didn't I? Charu, if you have some time, can I sing something? Go ahead. What would you like to hear? Tell me. Whatever you like. I feel.. I feel like.. Charu. I have a friend, who is obsessed with writing. I don't understand anything. I wonder, whether we can call his writing, poetry? Will you read and tell me, what you think? I will be right back. Is your friend attempting to write for the first time? Yes. It is very beautiful. It doesn't seem, as if a novice has written this. -Really? -Yes. I am the novice. In that case, you must write. It is very beautiful. Hum it. Perhaps, you will come up with some music. That's great. I will attempt it. I will surely do it. Postman. -See what I have got. -Where? -No. Not now. -Where? Not so soon. -Give it to me. -No. Not at all. -I knew it since morning. -No. We will surely receive Amol's letter. Show it to me. It's not a letter. But, don't get upset. Yesterday, I stayed awake the whole night and composed music. I thought, it is Amol's letter. Can we send a telegram to Amol? I wonder, whether he is doing all right? Right? We received his letter, just a week ago. He must be busy, studying. Well then, it's fine. I thought, he is in a foreign country. What if, he falls ill? There is no harm in asking, right? No. If he had been sick, we would have heard it, from somewhere. As it is, it is very costly to send a telegram, abroad. Is that so? I thought, it costs one or two rupees. No. It costs around Rs.100. Then, it's futile to think about it. Telegram! Give it here. I am well? I didn't send this telegram. Perhaps, you have sent it? Charu. Yes. Where are my poems? I have them. Give them to me. Do you want them, now? Yes. I want them, now. Mr. Bhupati. Mr. Ramesh, please come. Sit. -How are you? -I am fine. I have come to request you for something. -Tell me. -I hope you won't disappoint me. My friend is going to start a new publication, in Mysore. He wants a good editor, like you. So, I told him about you. He was very excited. He wants you to work for his newspaper. When will you come to meet me? Whenever you feel, I can alleviate your loneliness.. ..write me a letter. I will come back. Don't leave me. Take me to Mysore with you. Charu, where do I go? To the wife, who is always thinking about somebody else? And who has become dead to me? There is no place in her heart, for me. You were the foundation of my life. But, that foundation is gone now. Won't I even get the chance to forget that? Do I still have to bear the pain of those memories? When I return home, in an unknown city.. ..the truth will stare me in the face, every day. How many deaths will I die? How long will I have to tolerate her, because she is my wife? Although, she can't even look at me! We built this nest together, Charu. But now, it has broken and shattered. Don't I have the right to discard its remnants? No, Charu. I can't do this, now. Come with me. No. You go. It is better, that I stay back. Sir. What's the matter? Do you have some other work? Sir, I wanted to say something to you. Yes. Tell me. I want a few days' leave. -Leave? -Yes, sir. But, you have joined work, recently. Why do you want leave, so soon? I have been in a dilemma for many days, sir. My life is a puzzle and it's important to solve it. My sister's health is deteriorating, day by day. And I can't take good care of her. Don't talk in riddles. Tell me, clearly. Both of you have got a place to stay. You earn a good salary. And yet, you are unable to take care of her? It's a very long story, sir. I don't mind telling you. But, do you have so much time? I have all the time in the world, for a good story. Tell me. Why do you want leave, to go out of town? Sir, do you know.. ..Mr. Anukul's family? -The high court judge? -Yes. I know him. I have met him a few times. I used to work for him, since his father's time.
