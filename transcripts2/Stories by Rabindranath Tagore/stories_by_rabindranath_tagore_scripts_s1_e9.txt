 Sister-in-law. Brother. Brother. Sister-in-law. Brother. Yes. Sister-in-law, look what I have got! A massive Rohu (carp) and three of my friends. You will cook fish and we will eat. Today, we will eat fish prepared by you. Oh, no! You should have informed me that you are coming, Amol. It weighs at least five kilos. You should have informed me that you are coming, Amol.

 It's 12 o'clock. How will I prepare a lavish lunch, so soon? Sister-in-law, don't say that. It will be humiliating for me. I have spoken to them very highly about your cooking. If they don't get food, they will taunt me all my life. Why are you standing? Seek her blessings. Oh! Please, no! Sister-in-law, he is Shailesh. He has magical hands, sister-in-law. He's a musician. And, this is Mrinal. God hasn't been generous with his height, but, he is a nice chap. Do you know him? -No. -Don't you know him? KC Ray. KC Ray's brother's wife's nephew.

 Not his nephew, I mean. The nephew's friend. Right? I don't know. Fine. Gopal, take the fish. Yes. Gopal, take it. Thanks. So, tell me. Will you eat fried fish or fish in gravy? Sister-in-law, prepare it anyway you want. Just prepare it yourself. We will finish it off. Why do you listen to him, Charu? He always creates a racket. He barges in here at any odd time, to ask for food. Today, he has brought his friends, too. I like it, when guests arrive. Here are the vegetables. I am leaving. Manda, how are you? Are you happy? Why? Why won't I be happy? What happened? Nothing. -What are you looking at? -Just looking. Just looking at what? I am overwhelmed to watch you cooking. It feels nice. Silly boy. What nonsense! Say all this to your wife. Go away from here! Leave. Or, I won't spare you. What did I do wrong? I am overwhelmed to see the fried fish. Is that so? When will it get ready and when will we eat it? When will it attain salvation? -Sister-in-law, where is brother? -In the office. Where else? What's the mood forecast? Fine. He is working. -Can I go and meet him? -Okay. Listen. The application letter must reach the Kalighat office today. Okay. Brother. Amol. Come, my brother. Tell me something. Why do you always cause a racket? What do you want? Do you want to attract everybody's attention? Sorry. I am kidding. How is the singing job going on? Not a singing job, brother. It's music. Why don't you ever take me, seriously? Yes. Exactly. The great future singer and musician, Mr. Amol. How is the music going on? It's good. Okay. And how are you doing with the law studies? That is going on fine, too. Where are you staying these days? I have taken a house on rent, brother. But in Bangladesh, art, the artist and music.. ..have no importance or respect. Perhaps, the landlord will kick me out again, for making a din. Then, I will find another place. Why are you standing? Sit. Yes. Brother, artists are in bad shape. Why do you want to look for another place? Come and stay with me. No, brother. Don't start off with that, again. You know. I will practice music every morning. It will bother you. Then, you will also kick me out. Do one thing. Come and stay here, again. Okay? As it is, I have some work for you. The editor of a newspaper, Mr. Bhupinder needs help from a singer? Amol, I am not kidding. Your sister-in-law wants to learn music, again. She has told me to find her a teacher. You can teach her. You can stay here and practice as much as you want. But, have you given it a good thought? Yes. What is there to think? No. Listen, I am not an ordinary singer. There are no rules and restrictions in my music. I don't know what kind of music sister-in-law wants to learn. I don't even know, whether she will be interested in my music. And of course, I won't quit my practice. Let me warn you. You can practice as much as you want. There is no problem. As it is, I sleep less, since I have to publish my first edition. I leave for the office, as soon as I wake up. You can practice as much as you want, after that. Don't worry about your sister-in-law. She just wants to learn music. She doesn't have to sing on the stage. Fine. I will come tomorrow with my luggage. -Yes. Absolutely. -Okay, then? Yes. Fine, brother. Sister-in-law, the fish is very delicious. I feel like licking my fingers. -Are you doing well at law studies? -It's okay. -And music? -Great. -Sister-in-law, there is a problem. -What? All my teachers get upset with me. Sister-in-law, there are so many rules in music. You have to sit like this. You have to sing like this. And play the music like this. -If it sounds good, it's music, right? -Yes. So, what difference does it make.. ..how you sit and how you play the music? Absolutely right. Now, look at this. -He is Ramesh. You know, KC Ray? -Yes. Sister-in-law, when he sings.. ..you can actually hear the agony of his heart. -Is that so? -He sings so well! Ramesh, sing a song for sister-in-law. Relax. First, finish your food. After that you can sing, my music maestro. Careful. Yes. Ready? Come on. "O farm-fresh radish, come to my garden." "I'm a boy, you're the father." "O farm-fresh radish, come to my garden." "I'm a boy, you're the father." "O monsoon clouds.." "I'll follow you, don't be so restless." "If I knew it, I'd have eaten some curry." "You've smeared kohl in my heart." "Mounds of jaggery.." "..Cling together like blossoming jasmines." "Mounds of jaggery.." "..Cling together like blossoming jasmines." "O farm-fresh radish, come to my garden." "I'm a boy, you're the father." "O farm-fresh radish, come to my garden." "I'm a boy, you're the father." Amazing! Amazing! Great! Unusual use of words. Wonderful! Sister-in-law, are you laughing because you like it? Or are you mocking me? No. Your singing is so good, that these are tears of joy. Wow! Betel leaf. Sister-in-law, shall I make it for you? Yes. Sure. There is a way of serving betel leaf. There is an etiquette. I don't think, you know it. How much catechu to add? Which areca nut to add? Dry or moist? What should be added, first? I will have to teach you everything. I see. You see, I know how to make betel leaf and chew it, very well. I know, what kind of betel leaf you like. I had to deal with you during Charu's marriage. It's not so easy to forget an imp like you. Yes. True. After all, I have such a charming personality. Anyone who meets me, gets impressed. Charu, you will have to obey my order. What? There are so many cobwebs on the walls of this room. It should be cleaned, by the evening. Shift the cot by the window. And the window should always be open. So that, the breeze flows freely. The floor of the room is very dirty. Rub it clean and keep the room ready. Keep the room ready? Are you crazy? Now, he will command me. Look, you are my student, now. A while ago, your respected husband.. ..and my brother, hired me as your teacher. I am coming to stay here. -Stay here? From when? -From tomorrow. Nobody stays in this room. So, I will stay here. But, I am a stickler for cleanliness. So, you will have to take special care to keep it neat. Why are you still here? Come on. Come on. Start your work quickly. Obey your teacher's order. I will give you a slap and you will come to your senses. He will command me. Talk about an uninvited guest! Time. With the passage of time, both of you will reform. I am certain. I am leaving for now. -Go. -I will be back soon. -Go. Go. -Yes. Crazy fellow. Yes. Keep it here. Bring the pillow and the blanket from the other room. Didn't you clean this? It's so dusty. Tell somebody to clean it. Brother. Sister-in-law. Gopal Raicharan! Is somebody there? I have arrived. Now, this house will resonate with music. Hold this. -Here. -Yes. Don't touch this. These are musical instruments. Take the money and thank you. Is somebody there at home? A guest has come. Nobody is there to welcome him. I'm glad, I met you here. I hope, my room is ready the way I wanted. How would I know? I told Gopal. It must be ready. Go and see for yourself. Come on. Truth needs no evidence. I will find out, immediately. Amol, where are you taking this? Sister-in-law, nobody plays it. So, I thought I will take it to my room. I will keep it back. -Were you singing? -No. Why? I feel nervous. I have not practiced since a long time. You play something. "This unblemished heart of mine is drenched in your hues." "This unblemished heart of mine is drenched in your hues." "Whom do I ask? Who will tell me?" "Whom do I ask? Who will tell me?" "What has this happened to me?" "I've no idea." "This unblemished heart of mine is drenched in your hues." "The cards of love have been dealt.." "The cards of love have been dealt.." I don't know the next part. This life.. So, let's sing together. Shall I start? "The cards of love have been dealt in my heart." "In every moment, every bit of life.." "What is it that drives me crazy?" "Whom do I ask? Who will tell me?" -"I've no idea. -I've no idea." "This unblemished heart of mine is drenched in your hues." "Whom do I ask? Who will tell me?" "Whom do I ask? Who will tell me?" "What has this happened to me?" "I've no idea." "This unblemished heart of mine is drenched in your hues." "Someone speaks in hushed tones." "Someone in the jungle speaks in hushed tones." "Why does this heart rejoice so joyously?" "Why does the cuckoo.." "..in me sing?" "What's hidden in my heart?" "Whom do I ask? Who will tell me?" "I've no idea." "This unblemished heart of mine is drenched in your hues." Wow, sister-in-law! You sing so well. -Really? -Yes. We will sing in front of brother today. -No. -Yes. For sure. -No. -You will have to sing. -No, sister-in-law. -No, Amol. Umapati. Umapati. Yes, brother. Tell me something. What will we do with so many papers? The first edition is not even out, yet. Brother, it's cheaper in bulk. That's why, I bought it. I understand, that it's cheap. But, we had to spend a lot of money. We can cut down on our expenses. What if, it's not sold? Don't worry. The newspaper will be published. It will be sold. We will have readers. If the prices are less, we will surpass everybody. Brother, you simply publish a good newspaper and give it to me. Then, watch me make my magic. What is going on? Nothing, Charu. My teacher has said that when a singer sings.. ..his voice should have the tremor caused by winter. I am practicing that. Pour the water, sister-in-law. -Sister-in-law. -Yes. Since when did you become a music lover? Not a music lover, Charu. How can I lose this opportunity of harassing this imp? "Don't go." Which song are you humming? Don't you know this song? Yes. It sounds familiar. It is familiar. Mr. Ravi's song is familiar. Is it necessary to know all of Mr. Ravi's songs? People like you never get tired of praising his ordinary work. Ordinary? Are you provoking me? I am not provoking you. I am telling the truth. Is there no singer besides him, in all of Bengal? Why not? There must be. But, there is something special about his music. He speaks about nature and devotion to God, so simply. It's not overwhelming and it touches your heart, too. So much of depth. Such intense emotions. Beautiful and simple. This kind of music is a great achievement. Yes. Fine. But, new talent should also get a chance. New talent? As in? As in, me. Nobody wants to listen to me. The music company says, either sing Mr. Ravi's songs.. ..or compose music for movies. Do you write lyrics, too? Yes. -Can you compose music, too? -Yes. Then, sing for me! Would you like to hear it? "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "With the dark night concealed in a veil.." "With raindrops in its lap.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "With raindrops in its lap.." "A little aware.. a little lost." "A little awake.. a little asleep." "A little aware.. a little lost." "A little awake.. a little asleep." "A little asleep." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." Did you really write this song? Yes. "Armed with the restless arrows of desire.." "Armed with the restless arrows of desire.." "Bracing the darkness of the rain-laden clouds." "Armed with the restless arrows of desire.." "Bracing the darkness of the rain-laden clouds." "The music of the monsoon." "Some bring tears.. and some.." Something else. Why did you stop? Something else. That's all I have written, so far. I still have to write the rest of the song and compose it. Finish it, quickly. I mean, very soon. Do you like it? It was very beautiful. It touched my soul. The music had come alive.. ..and it felt as if, I was seeing it, not hearing it. What are the teacher and the student doing? Hello, brother. Nothing much. We were just discussing music. I want to talk to both of you. Come inside. Sit. The important news is that, we have received.. ..a very good marriage proposal for Amol. They want to send Amol abroad for law studies, after the wedding. Wow! And they will bear all the expenses. What do you have to say? -It's very risky, brother. -Why? -Yes, brother. -How? Brother, what if I go abroad and fail in the exams? They might annul the marriage. -But.. -Brother, they might ask me to return.. ..the money that they spent on me. -But.. -Brother, I am a musician. Brother, don't distress me in this manner. I can't do it. I just can't. Yes. You will become a laughing stock. The marriage had to be called off. The groom was good-for-nothing. And he couldn't even pass his law exams. Did you see? Did you see, brother? Sister-in-law also feels that accepting the alliance.. ..is like inviting trouble, brother. It's as if, I am asking for trouble. Brother, why? Why are you doing this to me, brother? There is no need for this, brother. Brother, I should study law and go abroad, too. I should get married and pass the exams, too! Don't be afraid of the exams. I am absolutely certain.. ..that if you study hard, no exam is difficult for you. Brother. Brother, you are truly generous. I am your brother. That's why, you are confident about my ability. But, let me tell you. I barely manage to pass with great difficulty, brother. Moreover, studying law, abroad? I can't do it! Brother, I will be humiliated, in public! And.. and.. My wife will taunt me for the rest of my life. No, brother. I can't do this. I don't accept this. I am going. No. He is so dramatic. Don't tell me. He is your brother. Yes. Show me. Make 500 copies of this. Brother. Charu, where is brother? He went to the office, early in the morning. I came to congratulate him on his first newspaper edition. His biggest dream has come true today. It's such a joyous event! Did you read it? Yes. He showed it to me. I just loved it! His thoughts and expressions about women.. Listen. Did you finish your song? No. Not yet. Why? I thought.. Did you really like my song? Yes. I am saying it, again. It's really, really beautiful. -Really? -How else do I say it, Amol? I am waiting to hear the full song. I will write it now and bring it. The sales are not good. Brother, it will get better. It was just the first edition. I am wondering, what to write in the next edition. I will leave, brother. -Listen. -Yes, brother. I don't think, we should print too many copies of the next edition. Brother, more the copies,  more the people will notice it. That's when it will get sold. Brother, just publish the paper. Let me handle the business end. I will leave, now. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Where is sister-in-law? Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law, I have been looking for you, since so long! -It's done. -What? -The song is complete. -I see. With capricious wishes. With the pride of grim clouds. With the rhythmic music of the monsoon. -Yes. -Right? With some hopes and some victories. Sing it. Should I sing it? "Armed with the restless arrows of desire.." "Bracing the darkness of the rain-laden clouds." "The music of the monsoon." "Some bring tears.. some bring victory." "They usher light into these lanes, o dear." "The bees hum to it, o dear." "Lost and dreamy.. dreamy." Did you like it? -It's for you. -Is that so? "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." "Eyes like a pair of petals.." Attention. Attention. Attention. Villagers, your attention please. Do listen to the radio today, at 8 p.m. Do listen to the radio. Did everybody hear that? Sister-in-law. Charu. Sister-in-law, do listen to the radio at 8 o'clock. Don't forget. Sister-in-law Manda. Sister-in-law Manda. Sister-in-law Manda. Listen to the radio at 8 o'clock. Don't forget. Okay? Why? What is going to happen at 8 o'clock? Hitler is going to drop a bomb on Kolkata! Listen to the explosion on the radio. All India Radio. You are going to hear a song sung by Amol Sen. "A pair of beautiful eyes." "A pair of.." Sister-in-law. Charu. Sister-in-law, open the door. What happened? Is the door locked? No problem. Take this. -Betel nut leaf. -For me? Can I say something, Amol? You sing really well. Yes. You are talented, too. Yes. That depends on the beholder. Yes. Sister-in-law, I will sing this song for you. It's a new song that I have written. -I have still not sung it for anyone. -Yes. I am going to sing it on the radio station. So I am thinking, I will first sing it for you. -Let me know how it is. -Yes. Sure. Shall I begin? Charu. Charu. Charu. What happened? You have not come out, since morning. I am not in the mood. Come out in the open air. You will feel better. No, sister-in-law. I told you! I am not in the mood. Which song is this? I composed a new song. I composed it myself. That means, everything is fine. Is your fight over? Is he teaching you music? No. He has become a big singer. His songs are played on the radio. He doesn't have time for me. Really? Amol's song was on the radio? Yes. But, forget about that. I composed a song. I thought, I will sing it for you, when you come home. -Will you listen? -Yes. Why not? No. This is not right. Yes. This is fine. Listen.
