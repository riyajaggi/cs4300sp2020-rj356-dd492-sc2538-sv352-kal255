 {\an8}Sir, the road is closed. It won't open for two days. {\an8}All right. Come. Sit. {\an8}Driver, take me to the railway station. {\an8}"My lover is within me. So I see him wherever I see."

 Okay. Listen. Do you have a matchstick? 'Her voice sounded familiar.' 'But I dismissed it as my delusion.' 'But when the lantern was lit.. I was dazzled.' 'Bedazzled.' 'It was the light of the lantern.' 'But it was as dazzling as thousands of suns.' 'Her face still glowed as it did six years ago.' "My heart is broken." "Today, my heart has been broken." 'Was it a coincidence? Or a moment that takes your breath away.' 'Or the end of the search of six years.'

 'Was she really standing in front of me?' 'I believed.. when she spoke.' 'It's Binodini.' When did you start growing a beard? It's been six years. Six years. Six years. Why? You started growing a beard in the grief of getting separated from me? As such, it doesn't look good on you. -You look... -Old? You look different. You have also changed. Do I look old? How come you are here? I was going to Kolkata. All the roads are blocked. So I thought it will be best to go by train. Now you don't work for Bharat Sevashram, do you? How do you know? In the last six years.. ..I enquired about you in all their branches. I ended up touring the whole country on this pretext. Are you studying medicine? Or did you quit it? I have started a charitable trust. You are treating people for free. Won't you ask the name of the trust? Nihar. NIHAR I still carry it with me. NIHAR SHRIMATI BINODINI DEVI Are you also going to Kolkata? No. I am going in the opposite direction. Siliguri. How did you come to Bolpur? I was living in a shelter home for widows for the past few days. I go wherever my destiny takes me. Due to my radical thoughts, I don't last for.. ..more than a month, in any shelter homes. At times I feel it would have been better if I had been uneducated. Like other widows, I would have been able to.. ..easily endure the society's negligence. 'This was the era where women's literacy..' '..was considered to be a vice and not a virtue.' 'This vice had a virtue.' 'She knew singing.' "How can you bloom so fresh and fair?" "How can you chant, you little birds?" "And I am so weary, full of care." "Flowers-florets sway to.." "..and fro as blows mild breeze." "Rivulets raise waves.." "..and then withdraw happily with ease." "You will break my heart, you warbling bird." "Flowers-florets sway to.." "..and fro as blows mild breeze." "Rivulets raise waves and then withdraw happily with ease." I thought, I won't find an educated girl for Mahen in this life. But who knew the girl is right in front of us? Binodini, she is leaving. 'Binodini's mother and my aunt Rajlakshmi..' '..were childhood friends.' 'Aunt left her darling son's photo with Binodini's mother.' 'Only Binodini could be the perfect bride for her only son.' 'Binodini saw the photo and even gave her consent.' 'But the man in the photo was of a different opinion.' 'Brother Mahen wasn't my actual brother.' 'But he was more than a brother for me.' 'He was born into the richest family in Darjeeling.' 'He had the best upbringing.' 'He was studying medicine.' 'It was his nature to do as he pleased.' 'He wasn't sympathetic enough to understand other's feelings.' 'So four days before the marriage..' '..he refused without thinking.' Get married. Find a better, modern groom for your friend's educated daughter. The marriage is after four days. Marriage spells trouble, mother. What nonsense are you talking! Do you even know, how much I will be slandered in my hometown? Yes. Your humiliation is better than my devastation. At least see the girl once. You will change your mind. Fine. I will see her and then reject her. I don't want to get married, mother. 'Brother Mahen was like my elder brother.' 'His mother was like my mother.' 'I used to be brother Mahen's shadow, when we were children.' 'I would always agree with whatever..' '..brother Mahen would say.' 'But whatever brother Mahen wouldn't do..' '..I would be expected to do it.' Anything important? Look, Behari. I won't wish you ill. My promise will also be fulfilled, and you will lead a happy life with Binodini. Binodini? Aunt Harimati's daughter? You have heard about her, haven't you? She is very beautiful. She is cultured. She is educated. But aunt, you were going to get her married.. ..to brother Mahen, weren't you? So why me all of a sudden? Mahen has refused. According to me, he has rejected a golden opportunity. Aunt, in childhood you would give me.. ..brother Mahen's leftover sweets. And I never refused to eat it. But the girl brother Mahen rejected.. ..you will thrust her on me. That's not done. I don't accept it. Spare me. Behari, at least see her once. 'Aunt was hurt by brother Mahen's refusal.' 'But my refusal crushed her.' 'But what could I do? I spoke my mind.' 'Who will live with her friend's curse?' 'Aunt got Binodini married to her distant relative's son.' 'Like an animal, Binodini was tied..' '..from one stake to another.' 'If brother Mahen hadn't refused..' '..and aunt hadn't done haste..' '..our story wouldn't have been like that.' 'But this is what had to happen.' They have come! They have come! They have come! They have come! They have come! They have come! 'After rejecting Binodini and vowing never to marry..' '..brother Mahen finally got married.' 'To Ashalata.' 'He was stubborn.' 'But finally he relented.' Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Sister, it's the first and last marriage in the family. We should have been there to welcome the couple. Had we not been widows, we would have surely done that. Honestly, sister. As such, I am used to it. But on such occasions I lament being a widow. I want to see them just once. Our gaze should fall on the married couple? Are you crazy? 'If a play was to be made on brother Mahen's marriage..' '..it would be a hit.' 'Aunt didn't approve of this alliance.' 'She felt Ashalata is not worthy of her son.' 'And aunt Annapurna wants to make her niece..' '..the daughter-in-law of the family.' '..in order to control brother Mahen.' 'To save aunt Annapurna's heart from breaking..' '..brother Mahen decided to make me the scapegoat.' What all things I have to do for you, Behari. It's your marriage. And I am being dragged into it. You told aunt without asking me first. 'Behari will marry Ashalata.' Aunt wanted you to marry her. And you thrust your burden on me. I did that so that aunt's heart doesn't break, Behari. I am going to see the girl for aunt's sake. And listen, just see the girl. If you don't like her, you can refuse. What's the problem? It's not about whether I like her or not. So? Won't aunt be humiliated if I reject Ashalata? You are right. Make aunt happy. Get married. This isn't right, brother Mahen. Behari, will you still say that if the girl is beautiful? Behari.. last night I thought a lot. About what? About aunt Annapurna. She wants her niece to marry me. She has said that countless times, in countless ways. You spoilt your slumber for that? No, Behari. She will be heartbroken.. ..If her niece doesn't marry me. We can't deny this possibility. I was wondering, what kind of a man am I? I can't even give a little joy to my aunt. If I don't give her this joy, I will feel guilty all my life. Behari, I.. Leave it, brother Mahen. Go outside and tell everyone. You have reclaimed your burden.. ..which you had thrust on me. For aunt's happiness. Give this good news to everybody. Shall I? Right now. It's been four days. We haven't stepped out of the room. You are counting days after bowling me over. Go out. Or else let me go. You are already bored? No. People must be gossiping about us. Let them do that. Come here. Nobody will say anything to you. Everybody will blame me. Forget about others. Tell me.. ..What am I looking at? I don't know. The mole on your lip. You saw it now? No. I saw it when Behari had come to see you. That's when I decided that this mole is mine. Listen. Do you know how many moles you have on your body? 23. -24. -23. -24. -23. "Who plays.." "..the flute.." "..the flute of my heart?" "Who plays the flute?" "I'm smiling in happiness.." "..the pain of my heart is gone." "Who plays the flute?" Disgusting! Do you see what's happening, Annapurna? Rats eat inside their hole. Your niece is also like that. She likes eating in the room. It can't be solely her fault, sister. Mahen must have also desired it. All his desires are awakening after marriage. Sir, your meal. Asha. 'My aunt and aunt Annapurna's discord about..' '..making Ashalata their daughter-in-law..' '..was resuming after the marriage.' 'Aunt had started feeling humiliated.' 'And her own son was humiliating her.' 'Her son, who would always hover around her.' 'Now brother Mahen would spend..' '..all his days and nights in his room.' 'He had nothing to do with anyone.' 'Why would aunt stay here when her son was no longer hers?' 'She decided to go to her hometown, Malda.' Aunt, I am also coming with you. All of a sudden? Yes. Brother Mahen told me to drop you. Come on. Sir, the money got drenched. Now, how do I book the ticket? Do you have some money? You are a useless fellow. I gave you my wallet. You are strange. Listen, I have it. No. It's all right. You gave it. But what do I do now? Shall I take the car? Where will you go? To madam's house. I will take the money and be back soon. Yes. Fine. Go. Take it from her. Okay? The train is at 5:30. You remember, don't you? Come before that. Go. -Quick. -Okay. And tell him to drive carefully. Okay, sir. You got married? No. Oh! There is a senior doctor in my college. Dr. Roy Chaudhary. I had gone to his house. Gopal has gone to get money from his daughter. She is a doctor? Yes. She works with me. He wants his daughter to marry me. What do you want? I don't know. Do you like her? 'I am again losing the opportunity.' 'In reply to her question I can tell her..' '..that I like only you, Binodini.' 'But why can't I say it?' 'Why can't I say that I like only you?' 'From the time I first saw you in Malda.' 'Covering yourself with your white sari..' '..you were passing by me.' 'From then till the day you suddenly disappeared.' 'I had liked you.' 'And then, there was a gap of six years between us.' 'Unknowingly I have spent each moment looking for you.' 'Today, after six years, on this rainy night..' '..I met you all of a sudden.' 'And I realized that I can't like anyone besides you.' 'How could I?' 'I haven't been able to forget those four days in Malda.' 'There was no conversation between us.' 'Still you would read my mind.' 'You took such good care of me.' 'A clean room.' 'Washed and ironed clothes.' 'How did you know which books I like?' 'How did you understand the silence which nobody could understand?' 'I spent all my life taking care of others.' 'For the first time somebody was taking care of me.' 'And it was you, Binod.' 'You didn't expect anything in return.' 'If you had any expectation, you didn't express it.' 'I wish you had expressed it.' 'In Malda.' 'During those four days.' 'I wish you had said something.' 'I had said something.' 'I wish.' 'Who knows? If we had spoken..' '..our lives wouldn't have been the way it is.' 'Who knows?' 'Who knows? Perhaps there is a reason why we met unexpectedly.' 'You still don't know that day I had touched your name..' '..written on your book with my fingers.' NIHAR 'And I was spellbound.' 'Who knows? You might have also felt something that very moment.' NIHAR SHRIMATI BINODINI DEVI 'Who knows?' -Aunt. -Yes. What happened to Binodini's husband? Terrible stomach ailment. He died only six months after marriage. Poor girl became lonely at such a young age. If you are so concerned about her, get me married to her. Leave your modern thinking. You didn't do it when you could have done it. Now you are trying to be great. Brother Mahen has sent a letter. For me? My name is written on it. He must have written something for you too. Shall I read it? Yes. Read it. "My dear brother, I won't ask you how mother is." "I know she must be fine." "Who won't be happy to return to one's village.." "..and live in one's childhood home?" "Mother has forgotten me and Teen Dharia." "Don't misconstrue me, Behari." "But the truth is that Ashalata and I are very happy here." "You are my friend and my brother." "That's why I don't feel hesitant.." "..to tell you about my love life." "Asha and I are so engrossed in love.." "..that we have no inkling of day and night." What happened? Read further. Yes. That's all he has written. Next he has written, "Give Asha and my greetings to mother." Yes. "You are my friend and my brother." "That's why I don't feel hesitant.." "..to tell you about my love life." What happened? Why did you stop? Read further. "Asha and I are so engrossed in love.." "..that we have no inkling of day and night." "The touch of her finger is so soft that my entire body..." Enough. Enough. Shameless boy! "The touch of her finger is so soft that my entire body feels enraptured." "When she tosses her wet hair.." "..pearls scatter on the roof of the house." "My shirt gets drenched in this unseasonal rainfall." "When I turn to look, I see her smiling." "Like a mischievous young girl." "There are many hues of mischief in her eyes." "I am lucky to see this rainbow in my room everyday." "What do I say, my friend?" "Love is a strange thing." "Whenever I see Ashalata, I experience this love." "I feel like relishing this love all the time." "I feel like submerging myself in the sea of love." "This tempest is thrilling, my friend." "What's there in a stable life?" "Your well-wisher. Mahen." 'Mahen's letter pierced my heart.' 'My wounded heart was more wounded.' 'The feelings I had developed for you..' '..were left behind.' Is this why you disappeared for a few days? No. I was very angry. -With whom? -Everybody. Aunt, Mahen, Ashalata. And.. And? -Me too? -Yes. You too. I was blinded with fury. I had never felt so deprived. "The letter reminded me of my tragic life." "It wasn't your fault." "It wasn't my fault too." "It was the fault of the man who rejected me.." "..and who was engrossed in somebody's love." "I felt it was important to restrain him." "I felt this is my life's purpose." "Let me see the man who affronted my dignity.." "..and who was leading a happy life." "Let me see whether he smiles or suffers when he sees me." Aunt. What is it? Aunt, Mr. Mahen's letter. Read it out. "Respected mother." How long will I have to face your wrath? If you think.. "..my heart can endure the pain of your separation.." "..you are wrong." "Your son has made a mistake." "And your son accepts it too." "Can't my kind mother forgive her son?" "Seeking your forgiveness. Mahen." Behari went to Teen Dharia. And this letter arrived. Mahen has not written this. Aunt, your anger won't last for long. What if tomorrow you feel that you are wrong.. ..and Mr. Mahen has really written the letter? Then? Then what can a mother do? She will finally return to her only son. What happened? The joy of living with you was short-lived, aunt. Oh my! You are crying. Binodini. Aunt, in these few weeks you had become everything for me. I had got very attached to you. I don't know how  will I live without you. Why does it always happen with me? Whoever I form a bond with, goes away. I am left alone. Will you come to Teen Dharia with me? Aunt, don't ask me this question. I won't be able to refuse. I don't even want you to refuse. Kamla, show her the room. Go. Your house is beautiful. And old too. It's been 70 years. 70 years? It doesn't seem so. If the house is old and empty, it seems ancient. But if people live there, if there is hustle and bustle, it's good. Who lives where in the house? Do you see the room behind? Yes. That is the study room. When Mahen's father was alive.. ..he would smoke hookah over there. He would have his meetings. Sister used to live in the next room. But after his death she started living with us. Do you see the balcony over there? Where there are flowers. Yes. It's very pretty. Ashalata lives there with her husband Mahen. But now they have nothing to do with the world. That's why flowers of love are blossoming. Leave me. Somebody will see. Nobody will see. -No. It's tickling. -What? Nothing will happen. Come. -Don't do that. -No. Somebody will see. There is nobody at home. Hey! Wait. Where are you going? I am also coming. No. -No. Yes. -Okay. -No. No. -No. Yes. -Hey! Okay. Come. Come. -Shall I come? Sure? Think about it. Hey! What happened? What sound is this? Railway. Train? You have never seen it? No. You can see it from the balcony. Go, run. Otherwise you will miss it. -Shall I go? -Yes. I will just come. What are you doing? Leave it. Leave it. Take it, dear. You do it. She won't be able to do it.
