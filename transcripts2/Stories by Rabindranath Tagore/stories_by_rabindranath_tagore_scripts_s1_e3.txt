 'I was playing a game, to gain something in a fantasy..' '..that, I couldn't gain in reality.' 'You think, that I am being cruel.' 'Perhaps, I am.' 'But, I am not so shameless, that even after my friend returns..' '..I will continue to play games with her husband.' 'Don't reply to this letter.' 'Or I will have no option, but, to leave the house.' 'Is that what you want?' I found this letter in your shirt. If you had not taught me to read and write.. ..perhaps, I would have never been able to read this letter. Asha, I.. Asha. -Binodini, listen to me. -Go away from here.

 Bali has returned. Why are you still meeting me, openly? Shame on you. One feels ashamed, when the truth is a secret. And we have been exposed. Asha read your letter. Which letter? The one that you gave me, yesterday. How will I face her? No. No. Binodini! Listen. Listen to me. That's why I have decided, we have no other option.. ..apart from leaving all this and go away. -Should I elope with you? -Yes. What happened? Binod, what do you want? Binod, it's very difficult for me to live with Asha in the same house. Even if I become shameless and do this.. ..staying away from you, despite being so close to you.. ..it will drive me crazy. Listen to me, Binod. We have distanced ourselves from the world. Now, we only have each other. That's why, I am telling you to come with me. That's not possible in this life. It's not possible? Then, why did you make the impossible, possible? Why did you get intimate with me? Why did you write me letters? Why did you stay that night.. Because, you stopped me when I wanted to leave. Why did you stop me? Why did you say, "Can't you see the love in my eyes, Binod?" Why did you do that? Now, is it entirely my fault? No. It's not your fault. It's the fault of the feelings, without which.. ..we couldn't have come closer. Now that we are so close, it's difficult to stay away, Binod. That's why I am saying, pack your bags and come with me. Are you out of your mind, Mahen? Do you know, what you are telling me to do? What am I telling you to do? Listen to me. We definitely can't fix the mess. At least, don't spoil what's good. That's all I am saying. Look, pack your bags and come. What happened? Mahen. What are you doing here, so late at night? There was a letter in my shirt. I came to take it. Did you find it? -Well.. -No. The clothes have been sent for washing. If you find my letter, give it to me. Mr. Behari? Yes. This is his house. But, he is not at home. -Okay. Where has he gone? -He has gone to Kolkata. He left today in the morning. -Kolkata? -Yes. -When will he return? -He won't return so soon. He got a job over there. I wanted to get to a destination. And that was you. My final destination. But, you were not there. At that time, I wasn't thinking straight. I was running. From myself. From everybody. From all the circumstances, created by me. I wanted to escape from all that and go to a place.. ..where I could find peace of mind. Where I could find you. But, you were not there. Mr. Behari, I knew you would accept me. No matter what I am like. I was certain of it. But, you were not there. You were not there. And I had no means to find you. My financial condition wasn't too good.. ..and so, I couldn't reach you. I.. That day, I was in a dilemma wondering what I should do. I didn't know what to do. So, I went away from there. I went far away. I left behind what I think is right and wrong, my principles. I left you. I left my love. I left everything behind. It was a time, when I felt like I am losing everything. I always felt like an obstacle between you and Mahen. I could never imagine that you.. ..that it would ever be possible, that you and I.. I always thought that.. ..Mahen loves you a lot. -And you love him. -No. I never loved Mahendra. But, he left everything and came chasing you. -How long will you be gone? -I don't know. I am going to find a job. I don't know, when I will find it. -I am leaving. -Listen. Isn't it possible for you to bring the one.. ..you want to settle down with, here? At least, let me come in. -Mr. Mahen. -What? -Go away from here. -What do you mean? I did not come here to leave. Open the door. Let me come in. I know, why you have come here. But for now, go away from here. Leave me alone. I am in grave trouble. I have come here to solve all your problems. -Let me come in. -No. Listen, don't aggravate my problems. People have a very low opnion of me. I don't want it to fall further.. People have a very low regard of you? You have become so selfish. You are thinking only about yourself! I am being selfish. And what about you? You didn't think about Ashalata, even once. Right now, I can't think about all that. Binod, right now, I can't think of anyone besides you. No. You can't think. But, I can think. About myself. About Ashalata. -About you. And aunt.. -Binod. Binod. Binod, listen to me. I am standing in front of you. I have left everything behind. I am standing in front of you. To settle down with you. To take you away from here. -Come on, Binod. Come with me. -No. No. -I can't do this. -Why? I can't do this. -What will people say? -What will people say? I have left my house and given up everything.. ..and I am standing in front of you! While you are concerned about people, but not me! Listen, Binod. It's too late, now. I won't be able to live without you. Perhaps, you also won't be able to live. Listen to me. We will leave from here. We will settle down elsewhere. -We will live together. -Mahen, where will we go? Kolkata. I have made all the arrangements in Kolkata. As soon as I heard Mahen talk about Kolkata.. ..a brazen thought gripped me. I thought, if I go to Kolkata, I may be able to get to you. I will find you. And as soon as I find you, I will tell you that.. ..you are the one, I have been searching for. But to do that, I will have to pretend to Mahen.. ..that I am going to Kolkata, to please him. That means, I will have to deceive him. I was ready to do that too. After all, I hoped to meet you. I thought, all's well, if it ends well. "All that my heart wishes for." "You are the one. That you are." "All that my heart wishes for." "In this world apart from you." "I have none, nothing I have." "All that my heart wishes for." "If it is happiness that you seek." "Go in search of happiness." "If it is happiness that you seek." "Go in search of happiness." "I have you in my heart." "Nothing more do I desire." "All that my heart wishes for." "You are the one. That you are." "All that my heart wishes for." -Does Mr. Behari live here? -I don't know. -Listen. -Yes. -Is Mr. Behari here? -Who is Mr. Behari? He is a doctor. No. There is nobody named Mr. Behari here. -Does Mr. Behari work here? -Who is Mr. Behari? He is a doctor. He has shifted to our branch in Banaras. "Pinning for you, in your absence." "I will live by your memories." "Through the eternal day and night." Where did you go? I had gone to the river banks. I must discuss something important with you. Tell me. Not like this. You have to pay attention. I am paying attention. Tell me. It's become difficult for me to venture out of the house. When I go out, I hear people talking about me. I have to lower my gaze and listen to people's taunts. Binod, it won't last for very long. Wait and watch. People will keep quiet, soon enough. It's easy for you to say this, but, not for me. So, what should I do? Tell me. Look, before we are humiliated and thrown out of the house.. ..we should go elsewhere. Binod, we can go anywhere. But, the circumstances will be the same, everywhere. -Do you regret it? -What? No. Do you? -Why don't you do one thing? -Tell me. -Let's go to Banaras. -Banaras? Yes. Leave me in a widow's home. You want to go to Banaras? Let's go to Banaras. -Hello. -Hello. Take me to Nukkarganj. Horse carriage. -Mr. Behari. -Go further. Listen, where can I find Mr. Behari? -Hello. -Hello. -Does Mr. Behari work here? -The doctor? Yes. The doctor. Yes. He works here. -Does he work here? -Yes. Do you need anything? -Where is he? -He is not here at present. He will return by evening. Do you have any message for him? I will come back, in the evening. Mahen? We have fought so many times in the past, right? But, our fights never lasted for more than two days. This time, you left Teen Dharia and you didn't even meet me. Are you so angry with me? Forget about it, Mahen. Have you really come to Banaras to meet me? Or.. For the past month, I have been looking for you. To apologize to you. You were right, Behari. You know, I am a very selfish man. I never thought about anyone, apart from myself. I didn't think about you, or Asha, or mother. I didn't even think about Binod. I can still apologize to mother and Asha. I can't apologize to Binod. So, I thought.. Why can't you apologize to Binod? Binod was suffering from typhoid, Behari. She refused to take any kind of treatment. Binod is dead, Behari. Binod is dead, Behari. I thought about what Mahen said, all through the night. I just couldn't believe him. I went to Malda, to verify it. To your house. Over there, I found out that Mahen had lied. Since then, I have been writing letters to you, regularly. Every day. I've been hoping that.. ..you will reply, some day. I never imagined that, he would stoop so low. You've returned very early. What are you looking at outside the window? I was just noticing, that it's so peaceful outside. Everything is peaceful outside the window, right? You are being poetic. I don't know what I was and what I've become. What are you saying? Why are you packing your bags? Okay, listen to me. Did you get any work done today? All my work was done, today. Whatever little is remaining, will also be done. Forget about all this. You tell me. Is your work done? -What do I have to do? -Yes. What do you have to do? Your job is to sweep, wash vessels.. ..cook and search for Behari. Isn't that what you do? Kolkata. Banaras. You are so brazen! You are so shameless. You stayed with me and yet, you betrayed me. You used me to find Behari. Actually, you deserve respect, not insults. Because, you didn't let me know what's going on. I had no idea at all. And I did whatever you said, like a crazy fool. I did, whatever you said! Without thinking, why have we shifted to another place? Why? Actually, you wrote a letter to Behari, right? I should have understood everything, the day I received it. But, I was blind! That a vile woman like you meant everything to me. Actually, God has done the right thing with you. You deserve to spend your whole life in a widow's home. Sir. Ma'am has brought the money, personally. I will be back. Everything is fine. Just wait for two minutes. I want to introduce you to someone. Wait. For lifelong companionship, it's not necessary to live together. We have gone, as far as we had to go. From here, our paths diverge. It's better for both of us. I will atone for my mistakes by serving people. You deserve someone better than me, Mr. Behari. She is beautiful. She is a doctor like you. Marry her. If you settle down, I swear, I will be really happy. Now, I have no grievances in this life. Life has done us a big favor, by bringing us together, again. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to resolve our grievances. I was at fault. But, you didn't let your love for me wane. Your Binod will learn to live with the help of this thought. Before leaving, all I will ask is that.. ..in our next birth, you should belong only to me. Don't belong to anybody else. Binodini. "The red soil road leading from my village." "The red soil road leading from my village." "It makes my heart wistful." "It makes my heart wistful." "Towards whom, has my heart stretched out its hands?" "Towards whom, has my heart stretched out its hands?" "And then rolled down on the dust." "It makes my heart wistful." "The red soil road leading from my village." {\an8}"It makes my heart wistful." "It makes my heart wistful." "It makes my heart wistful." "It has made me go out of my home." "And I wonder for what it has made me crazy?" "I keep wandering for it." "I keep wandering for it." "I don't know where it winds its way." "It makes my heart wistful." "It makes my heart wistful." "It makes my heart wistful." 'Regional Song' 'Regional Song' 'Regional Song' 'Regional Song' 'Regional Song' 'Regional Song' 'Regional Song' 'Regional Song' Tara, come here. Here is your share, of five pennies. This time, people paid me handsomely.. ..because of your innocent face. I have earned Rs.12 in four days. Rs.4 is my share. I will buy seeds with this. It will be enough to feed my family for a year. Family? You are a sage. You are a hermit, aren't you? It's very difficult to renounce the worldly attachments, son. Come with me. We will grow crops. The harvest will be ready by spring. We will leave again, after that. What happened? Oh! I understand. You are searching for the meaning of life. Once, I had also gone in search of the meaning of life. Then, I found out that the meaning of life.. ..lies nowhere else, but, within you. The meaning of life? I have nothing to do with the meaning of life. I simply want to live life. I don't want to ask the tall trees, how they grew so big. I simply want to watch their vastness and feel delighted. I don't want to question the flow of the river. I simply want to watch it flowing, for miles on end. I want to assimilate this unique aspect of nature, within myself. I want to lose myself and not find myself. I want to dissolve as the sun dissolves in water. I don't know the meaning of life. But, I want to know what life is. Shankar, come here. -Who is that boy? -I don't know. But, he is very helpful. We could do all the work, only because of him. Without his help, it would have taken till evening.. ..for me, to cook the food. What is his name? Tarapada. -Are you from this village? -No. So? There is a village called Nandigram, in the vicinity. I have to go there. Nandigram? Come with me. No, sir. I will go alone. No, son. Come on. Why do you want to wander alone? We are going that way, anyway. We will drop you at Nandigram on the way. Oh my God! See, what has happened! Your clothes have dyed my clothes. What should I do now? What happened, Charu? What did she do? Mother, look! She spoilt my clothes. It's okay. It's enough. Forget it. Come on. Come up. Come on, dear. Give me the clothes. Give them to me. -Let go. What are you doing? -Hey!
