 Stories by Rabindranath Tagore (2015): Season 1, Episode 4 - Atithi - full transcript 
 Like the protagonist of a road movie the young Tarapada was restless. To the despair of his mother and villagers, Tarapada repeatedly ran away. But he was curious about the world rather than alienated from it. The blissful nature hailed him with endless bounty. He could hear the mystic melody of the nature. He joined a troupe of acrobats and then wandered on. One day he caught a boat ride with a village zamindar. His natural virtuousness and spontaneity attracted the zamindar and his wife. His pleasant voice enchanted everyone, except their envious daughter Charusashi. She could not endure Tarapada. The impenetrable feelings of love and hatred, possessiveness and gentle gestures hovered between. Tarapada settled with the Zamindar family in their village and won the villagers heart. Two years spent. . Charushashi's unpredictable tantrums casted a bitter sweet spell on Tarapada's wander lust mind. Love started spreading its shy wings. Zamindar Motibabu fixed Charu's marriage with Tarapada. The day before the wedding night the monsoon clouds grumbled. The all encompassing smell of the first rain filled the nature. An opera band was sailing across the quiet village. The mellow harmonies stroked the village. Ever restless Tarapada disappeared again leaving all the love, comforts, and belongings behind.

 It's not good to get so angry, Charu. Then, why did she hang out her clothes with mine? And then, she didn't even apologize! You did not even let her speak. Then, how could she apologize? Charu, just imagine what people must be thinking! That the landlord's daughter can't talk to elders. I am what I am. I don't care, if anyone feels bad. Sit down. And who was he? Who are you talking about?

 Doesn't your mother love you? No, no, she does. She loves me a lot. Then, why did you run away? My mother has my brothers and sisters to love. Mother will love them a lot. It is not necessary that those who.. ..are not loved, run away from home. And I did not run away from home. This world is my home. But, the world can't love you like a mother, my son. I wonder, why I get the same reactions every time? I don't know, why these people get surprised. I don't know why, everyone wants to make.. ..me realize, that I have made a big mistake.. ..by running away from my home. My nature is like a hay twig, flowing on the water. I just want to keep on moving. I feel that, travelling helps you find your soul, not new lands. This was the fourth time, that I'd run away from home. Four months ago, when I returned back home.. ..after being away for six months.. ..I had thought that, I will not run away from home, now. Mother, mother.. Mother, Taro has come back. It is good to roam about, but, it is wrong to run away. Priest, I don't run away. The moment I leave this village, I get to learn a lot. What do you want to learn? What do you want to learn? Haven't I taught you anything, since so many years? Priest, I want to learn even more. I want to go to far away countries and learn different languages. Look! Look at this boy. First, learn how to plough the fields. Learn how to sow the seeds. All of this will be very useful to you. Yes. Go and teach those boys. Go. 7 times 3 is 21. 7 times 3 is 21. 7 times 4 is 28. 7 times 4 is 28. 7 times 5 is 35. 7 times 5 is 35. Seventeen times 6 is 102.

"Bring some mud from the village." "I have left behind my heart." "I have left behind my heart." "I have left behind my heart." "I have left behind my heart." The last time, when I returned home.. ..I had thought that, I will never run away from home. But once again, the outside world started attracting me towards it. A new world. I had the urge to meet new people. That forced me to leave the house, once again. "I have become a traveler with it." "I have become a traveler with it." "Where does my heart take me?" "I have left behind my heart." "Get some mud from the village." "I have left behind my heart." "I have left behind my heart." "I have left behind my heart." "I have left behind my heart." Are you from this village? No, at some distance from here.. ..there is a village called Nandigram. I want to go there. Nandigram? Come with us! See? The boy has talent. He seems to be from a good family. You are right. He really is a nice boy. Good boys do not run away from home. Keep quiet, Charu. What do you know? Do this, then this and then.. Tara, which song are you singing? Just humming. Sing louder. We want to hear it, too. Sing. "Listen, boatman." "Which way is your boat going?" "Listen, boatman." "Which way is your boat going?" Isn't he singing well? "Take me along with you." "Which way is your boat going?" "Listen, boatman." "Which way is your boat going?" "Row with your oars and take me to the other side." "Row with your oars and take me to the other side." "I don't have anyone here." "I don't have anyone here." "Listen to the call of my heart." "Which way is your boat going?" "Listen, boatman." "Which way is your boat going?" "The boat trembles and heaves and I feel apprehensive." "Oh, my heart.." "Where will you take me, boatman?" "My eyes are bathed in tears.." "..my heart is weeping for someone." "I don't have anyone here." "Listen to the call of my heart." "Which way is your boat going?" "Listen, boatman." "Which way is your boat going?" "Listen, boatman." "Which way is your boat going?" Tie it properly, so that it does not fall. Mother, let's go home, quickly. Okay, you go on inside. No! I will go in the bullock cart. Okay, then go. Listen.. Yes, tell me. He is a very nice boy. It would have been nice, to have him stay a while with us. Tarabodho, come here. Come here. Come here. Do you have anything important to do at home? No. Nothing at all. Then, come with us for a few days and stay at our house. Yes, sir. I was just waiting for.. ..you to ask me to come with you. Then, what are you waiting for? Go and sit in the cart. Go on. Sit down. Come on, we have reached home. We have reached after so many days! It feels really good. See, what he is doing? Listen! See, what he is doing! Why are you smiling? If Tarabodho is around, then the sound.. ..of laughter resonates all over. It has just been four days, since he came here. And it seems, as if he is one of us. He gets along so well, with everyone! Hey, sweet girl! Come here. Where have you been for so many days? Is everything all right at home? Everything is fine. Mother hasn't been well for a while. Tell me, what happened? Nothing. She just had fever. She is fine now. Aunt, where is Charu? Charu is sitting and sulking. She was asking about you, all week long. You never said anything to her, you see? Go inside and meet her. Won't you talk to me, Charu? Talk? I've been looking for you since a week! But, you weren't even bothered! You didn't even come to meet me, once. You didn't even care to check, whether I'm dead or alive! Don't say that, Charu. My mother was not well. That is why, I could not come. Are you telling the truth? What happened to her? Why would I lie to you? Mother had fever, but she is fine now. Who else will look after her, if not me? Okay, forget about all that. Tell me, how are you? I want to talk to you about a lot of things. But, I can't resist telling you one thing. I've wanted to tell you for so many days, now. So, listen to me, now. While we were returning, we stopped the boat.. ..at Ichhapur, to cook food. Father, mother and I got down. Do you know what happened, then? Dadabhai, Tarabodho.. Hey.. Where is my flute? It is there. I have made it. I promised you. Wait, I will get it for you. Do you know him? Yes. How come? He came home. Mother was singing devotional songs.. ..and he was playing the flute. He plays the flute very sweetly. He was with us for 3 or 4 hours. We talked a lot. Mother asks every day, when Tara will come back. I have come back. Here, take your flute. Now, where is my 'Aamsotto' (Indian snack)? Wait. Here you are. Okay. Charu, my flute. You eat, while I get my flute. Wait, eat and then go. No, I want my flute. Charu, my flute! Please, repair this. I do not know how the hand came off. So, you do not know how the hand came off? No. Did it come off, or did you remove it on purpose? What do you mean? I mean, nothing. What do you mean by nothing? Tell me. I mean, you have come to see.. ..whether, I am still annoyed or not. Isn't it? Like you, I don't get angry about every little thing. I just came here, casually. Do you like books? Do you know English? Do you want to learn? My son, before learning English, it is very important.. ..to know, how this language originated. How it became prevalent in our country? So first of all, we will discuss about the origin.. ..and prevalence of this language. Go, go on! Tarabodho, it is not fun to play without you. You also play with us. I am studying right now. You go and I shall come to play with you, later. If anyone does not want to come, its okay.. ..we are not bothered. Come on. They established their language in both written and oral. They used it in conversation, also. Father. What do you want, Charu? I also want to learn English. It is very good that you want to learn English. Come on, sit here. Okay, where were we? The British popularized their language... You will not go to father after completing your studies. Why? Just because I have said that, you will not go. But, why? Every day, after you complete your studies, you go to father.. ..and I get scolded, as I am not able to complete my studies. Then, you should also do the homework, like me. So, you will not listen to me. You live in my house, my father teaches you.. ..and, you will not listen to me. I'm done. Hey.. I just wanted to tell you something, so I was thinking.. ..whether I should say it or not. Tell me whatever is in your heart. There is no use of keeping it in your heart. Aren't we are looking for a groom for our daughter? Whereas, the boy is in front of us. The boy is in front of us? Who is it? It's Tarabodho. Tarabodho? Can we marry our daughter off to someone, just like that? We do not know anything about his house and family. We found him on the way. Will I marry my daughter to someone.. ..about whom we do not know anything? We can find about him. Listen, I have already promised Mr. Chaudhary. Now, nothing can be done. They have arrived, so, wear this sari. Charu, you should not be so obstinate, my dear. Now you have grown up, so you must wear this sari. I don't want to go down. I don't want to go down. Charu, stop being so childish! Everyone is waiting downstairs. Charu, listen to me and wear this sari. Charu.. Charu, wear this sari. I don't want to wear it. I am sorry. My daughter is not feeling well. That is why, I apologize to you. Mr. Chaudhary, you got these sweets for us. Will you take them along or leave them here? We will take them back. She is a very stubborn girl. If a boy comes to meet her and she does not come down.. ..then, she will not get married all her life. Please, calm down. Everything will be fine. I felt insulted and had to apologize to Mr. Chaudhary. You were right. Not everyone will be able to adjust with her. It would be best, if she stays in our house.. ..and under our supervision. So, are you.. Yes. Tarabodho is a good boy. Given the way he speaks, it seems he's from a decent family. Even then, it is important to get some more information about him. Sure. I am sure that his family must be nice. That will be fine. If I do this, I will get someone to help me with my work. And my daughter will also remain with me. Now, the rest depends on Tarabodho's family. Call the accountant. Take this. What is this? This is a diary. Every aspect of your life will be written in this. Write down whatever comes to your mind. And for me? What will you do with a diary? Why? I think of things, too. First, learn to string together four alphabets, at least. Then, write whatever comes to your mind. Don't you get angry? I trouble you so much. Then, don't trouble me. Okay, but, I don't know why I do this. I know why. What? That, this anger is just a mask. The person behind the mask, is filled with love. But, you are only Shona Moni's friend. Who told you that? You made the flute, just for her. So you tell me, what do you want? I also want a flute. Okay, I shall make a flute for you. But, you will have to promise me one thing. You will study every single day. Did you find anything? Yes, I got a lot of information. Then, tell me. Sir, Tarabodha's family is poor. They are just living hand to mouth. -But.. -But what? They are people with values and very well mannered. They are respected in the society. Everyone respects Tarabodho's family. Always get to the point first, sir. Money means nothing, in life. The hearts should meet, at first. -Isn't that right? -Yes, sir. And keep one thing in mind. Tara should not come to know.. ..that his family members are coming here. -Is it okay? -Yes. As you wish. Mother, your hair is falling out a lot. I will get you some good hair oil. Your hair will not fall and it will also stay black. I also want a plait. Braid my hair, too. Now, I am braiding her hair. Wait for some time.. ..and I will do it for you, also. No. First, braid my hair and then, hers. Braid her hair first, my son. Okay. Come along. Be gentle! Okay, I'll be gentle. Are you done? Yes, I have finished. Show it to me. Write it out completely. Go on! Write it. I am done. Come on, show it to me. It is good. I have been living with the landlord Motilal for a long time. Other than in my house.. ..this is the only place.. ..where I have stayed for so long. I have developed a kind of attachment to this house. I feel a strange kind of bond with the people of this house. It has never happened before. Why is this happening? Why do I feel that I am getting trapped.. ..in the whirlpool of relationships? I want to come out of it, but an opposite attraction.. ..is attracting me towards it. And I am getting drawn to it. My mind is losing it's direction in this tug of war. I can't understand why this is happening.  How will I get out of it? Charu. Didn't you meet the groom's family, yesterday? I did not even go downstairs. Why? I don't want to get married. Why not? I just don't want to get married. Now I understand, why the accountant went to Tara's house. What? Did the accountant go to that silly boy's house? But why? Now, you will have to get married. Run away from here. Go away. Go on, run away from here. Tarabodho, everyone is waiting for you there. Come on, the drama will start soon. They look so good together! Please, have something. Please call Tarabodho. Yes, he has gone to call him. He must be on his way. Sir. I cannot find Tarabodho. What do you mean that you can't find him? Look for him. He must be around here.
