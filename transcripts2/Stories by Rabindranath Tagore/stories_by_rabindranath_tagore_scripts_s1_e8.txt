 I see. So, this is what is going on here. You are shirking your work to play with the catapult! What is this? You have still not hung out the clothes to dry! Listen Mini, if I wash your and Upendra's clothes.. ..that doesn't mean it's my responsibility to dry them too. What? Am I your servant? No. That was a mistake, sister. Mini, how many more mistakes do I have to witness? Now, I feel like I am a liar and I am making all the mistakes. I wonder why you want to punish me! She looks so innocent.

 If I had known that she is so lazy, I would have.. ..never got him married to her. She always makes excuses to dodge the housework. She lives like a queen in the house. And look at me! Since the time I have come to this house, I've been working. I have been slaving for everybody. -Sister, you.. -I am absolutely right. I thought, she will come and I will get.. ..a helping hand and some respite. But, no way! It's the opposite. He has pampered her with studies and books. She's always reading those books! Did sister-in-law say something?

 I hope, you didn't retort to her, right? Listen, Mini. Sometimes, sister-in-law speaks bitterly in a fit of anger. But, she doesn't mean it. Give her some time to get to know you. Wait and watch. Everything will be fine. Can I tell you something? The one who scolds you the most, loves you the most. Do you understand? -Upendra. -Yes, brother. I am leaving. Don't mind her. Okay? O Goddess! Mr. Devendra, look at this one. It's nice, Gopal. -Did you record it? -Yes. -Did you pass it? -Yes. Great! Great! Upendra. Congratulations. This deal has come through, as well. God willing, this deal will take us to the heights.. ..which father always wanted us to achieve. Which heights? In the queen's teacup. -Mr. Gopal. -I will be right back. Congratulations, brother. Congratulations to you. Somebody has come to meet Mr. Devendra. Okay. Wait. Will you have some tea? Mr. Devendra. Somebody has come to meet you. He's in the office. {\an8}I've been meaning to meet you. William Montgomery. {\an8}I'm from Smith and Rusco Associates. {\an8}-Please take your seat. -Thank you so much. {\an8}Tell me. {\an8}As you may know, we and our associates look after legalities.. {\an8}..for some of the tea estates, in Darjeeling. {\an8}Yes. Yes. I am aware of that. Yes. {\an8}I should like you to have a look at this. How is it? It's nice. What do you think? What is going on inside? The Queen's teacup? The Queen's teapot. {\an8}I don't understand this. {\an8}Allow me to help you. It's one of the reasons I am here. {\an8}You see, if you look here, Mr. Banerjee.. {\an8}..the tea estates named towards Banerjee tea company.. {\an8}..released to Mr. Kishore Chandra Banerjee.. {\an8}..your father, right? {\an8}Yes. {\an8}For a period of 50 years. {\an8}Leased out? {\an8}I was afraid of something like this. {\an8}Yes. Leased, Mr. Banerjee. {\an8}You see, the estates are owned by Her Majesty. {\an8}And I don't mean to sound harsh.. {\an8}..but, your term is up for expiration. {\an8}But, my father never told me. Never. {\an8}It happens, Mr. Banerjee. {\an8}Hiding from one's family is nothing new. {\an8}I am somewhat surprised, you were not more aware.. {\an8}..given all the years of operation. {\an8}But then, being dark-skinned, how can one really expect.. {\an8}..to own tea estates, as vast as these? {\an8}I am pleased however, to announce.. {\an8}..there is some compensation during the transition. {\an8}This is a thumb impression. {\an8}My father used signatures. {\an8}Yes. {\an8}I really thought you were better than this, sir. {\an8}The thing is, when we resolve to acquire.. {\an8}..something for Her Majesty, we get it. Upendra, will you listen to me? Yes, brother? Whatever happened in the company today.. ..don't tell Mini about it. She is young. She has come to our house, just recently. It's just a temporary problem, Upendra. Just like after father's death, both of us together.. ..converted this sinking ship, into the Banerjee tea company.. ..and the Banerjee plant. We will do something this time, too. Don't worry. Mukul, finish your dinner. Finish your food. Mukul, you are a good boy, aren't you? Come on. Eat it quickly. What happened? Why don't you want to eat? I have cooked your favorite food, haven't I? Come on. Eat, as long as you are getting the food. Who knows, for how long you will get food to eat? Come on. Open up. Mukul, eat. You shouldn't have said that, Radha. What did I say? I told you. Mini doesn't know anything about the company. I told Upendra not to tell her anything. Yes. So? What has happened to you, Radha? Look, I said whatever I thought was right at that time. And Mini is a member of this family. She should know, what is going on outside and at home.. ..and what condition you and your brother are in. -It's futile talking to you. -Yes. Don't talk to me. Nobody is thinking about Mukul. But, keep trying your best to hide the truth from Mini. Oh God! Stop it. Keep quiet. She should also understand that.. ..what is going on at home, isn't right. And you better stop treating her like a queen. It's all about Mini, all the time! What are you doing? I was washing it. The way you wash the vessels, clearly reveals.. ..that you have not done this, before. -I never had to do all this. -Why? Because, mother says that girls don't have to learn all this. They automatically learn it, when the time comes. All mothers are like that. Hey! What happened? Nothing. Father sent a letter. Mother is not well. I want to meet her. Why didn't you tell me about this, before? Come on. I will talk to brother and take you tomorrow. Okay? Fine. Look at this. Wash it like this. Why are you crying? Everybody has to die, someday. What are you saying, mother? That won't happen. You will get well soon. Forget about me. You tell me. How are you? I am absolutely fine, mother. I have everything I need. Sister-in-law never lets me do any work. And Mukul, always thinks about me. Don't worry about me, mother. I am extremely happy. Just get well soon. I will fetch the horse carriage at once. Mini. You can hide it from your mother. But, not from me. I can understand that, it's very difficult.. ..to go to a new place and form new bonds. But, Mini.. ..now, your in-law's house is your home. And they are your family. How long will we stay with you? Mini, you are very lucky.. ..that you got married into a very good family. And Upendra is very sensible. He takes good care of you. And he always thinks about your well-being. Dear, I am sure.. ..he will stand by you in the good and bad times. Similarly, Mini, you will also have to support him. You will have to stand by him, always. Okay, Mini? My dear, Upendra should be the.. ..most important person in your life. Mini, you used to close your eyes.. ..and hold my hand trustingly and walk. With the same trust, you will have to.. ..hold Upendra's hand and walk. Under all circumstances. You will have to listen to whatever he says, Mini. Tell me, Mini. You will do it, won't you? I had lost my mind, when I got him married to her. Didn't you notice? They were pleading for everything. Not even did I feel, that this is a well-to-do family. And the girl is so headstrong, nothing affects her. While you are borrowing money to run the household.. ..there's that queen.. ..who has gone for an outing with her husband. Mukul, why don't you sleep? Close your eyes. Listen, Radha. I don't want to discuss this. You know that, Mini's mother is unwell. It's not wrong to go to see her. Don't start off on this topic. She only has a fever. She isn't dead. I also have a mother. I have my own family, too. I never go running back there. These are merely excuses to dodge work. Nothing else. She will do the housework. Just give her some time. When will she do it? For all these cunning and crafty women.. ..their family is family and others are strangers. God knows, what goes on in that girl's mind? She is engrossed in books, all day long! Wait and watch. I will burn all her books, some day. Is she going to be a writer in the future? Ultimately, she has to look after the household. Mukul, close your eyes. Tell me. How much for all this? Rs.60. Radha. Radha. Yes. Did you sell Mini's books? Yes. So? So, what? I just sold her books. Why are you so concerned about her books? Mukul's toys were sold. Doesn't that matter? Ever since she has come into the house, you have lost your mind. Why are you talking such nonsense? We don't have a penny in the house. And both the husband and wife don't do any work. Don't talk like that. Sister-in-law, we will talk later. Don't tell me, when I may talk or not! Mini doesn't have any sense. We have not told her, what is going on in the house. But, you know. Despite that, you went to your in-law's house to waste money. What about Mukul's future? Who will think about him? -Don't blame them for it! -Who else should I blame? You and your brother have lost your company. I am thinking, that I should go and find a job. Should I? -Sister-in-law, you don't.. -You better keep quiet. Ever since this girl has come into this family.. ..she has snatched the family's peace and joy. Don't test my patience. I see. So, you're feeling bad! What are you saying? What am I saying? What clandestine relationship do you and Mini share? You get furious on hearing about her. -Keep quiet. -Why should I keep quiet? -I am telling you to keep quiet. -Who are you to tell me that? What will you do? Yes. I will speak. -Quiet. Quiet. You.. -What will you do? Sister-in-law! Sister! Mini.. ..don't be afraid. Keep quiet. I will handle everything. What happened here? Tell me, what happened here? Mini and sister-in-law had a fight. Mini picked up the vase and attacked sister-in-law. Sister-in-law lost her balance and fell down. Is your husband telling the truth? Did you attack the elder daughter-in-law of this family? Take her away. This.. What are you doing? Mini. Mini. Mini, don't be afraid. Brother. I can get another wife. But, if I lose my brother.. ..I can't find another brother. How are you, Mini? They are not mistreating you, are they? Mini, I will handle everything. Don't be afraid. Mini, look at me. I will get you out of here, very soon. You'll see. You will go back home with us. Mini.. ..they will take you to the district magistrate, tomorrow. Just tell him that, you and sister-in-law had a fight. Yes, Mrs. Mrinalini. Did you kill the late Mrs. Radha? The fight escalated to such an extent.. ..that sister-in-law came running towards you. I have been told that the deceased.. ..and you fought the whole day. Did she try to harm you? Sir, she is not saying anything.. -I asked her, not you, Mr. Banerjee. -I.. Yes. Tell me, Mrs. Mrinalini. And everything happened so quickly.. ..that, you couldn't understand anything. Whatever you did, was in self-defense. Okay? Given the seriousness of the crime, I believe.. ..this case should be taken to the court. Are you the husband of the accused? Yes. Can you tell the court what happened that day? That day, my elder brother and I.. ..returned home from the office. And we.. ..I.. ..I.. Mini didn't do anything. I killed sister-in-law. What are you saying? It was a very bad day for us. I was already angry. I told sister-in-law to serve me dinner. She refused. I pushed her in a fit of anger and she fell down. I should be punished. -Don't tell lies, Upendra. -No, brother. You.. Stop it. -Brother, don't speak. -I can't take it anymore. I committed the murder. No. I committed the murder. I am responsible for my wife's murder. Brother.. Mini is very young. -Brother. -She didn't do anything. -I am the culprit. -No, brother. Punish me. Punish me. Order. Order. Order. Mrs. Mrinalini, tell me. Did you murder Mrs. Radha? You understand, don't you? If you don't say anything, your silence.. ..will be considered as your consent. It will be assumed that you accept.. ..all the allegations against you. Mini, what has happened? Mini, I am certain that.. ..you can't do what they are saying. Mini, I know you very well. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. Mini.. ..what are you trying to hide? Father, I am doing what you told me to do. Mrs. Mrinalini.. ..would you like to tell the court, what happened that day? The punishment for this crime is the death penalty. You understand what I am saying, don't you? Tell me. It's time, ma'am. I promise you. I will never leave you. Our life will flow smoothly with time. And like the banks of the river.. ..we will never leave each other. Mini.. ..don't be afraid. Keep quiet. I will handle everything. Your husband has come to meet you. She was standing unnerved in that witness box.. ..like a wounded bird surrounded by wolves. Helpless, broken and hapless. The tears streamed down her face. When our eyes locked for a few moments.. ..it shook the soul of this editor to the core. Is it that by giving the death penalty to an innocent woman.. ..in the name of justice, we are going to.. ..commit another serious crime? This editor has tried to understand in depth.. ..the crime of murdering a woman in her house.. ..and the subsequent legal proceedings. -Charu. -Yes? What's the matter, sister-in-law? Should we play cards? Fine. Come on. -Did you hear? -What? Do you know, sister-in-law? Seven different sparrows come to our house. And all of them make different chirping sounds. Charu, you are too much. I wonder what you keep thinking about? I am bound to think. They sound so melodious. How can one not hear them? I know only one sparrow. It spoils my sleep by chirping, ceaselessly. Honestly speaking, Charu.. ..I get so angry, that I want to break its nest. What are you saying, sister-in-law? -Here. I have lost. -Hey! Listen. Give me the tea. Charu. You carry on with your work. I just came in, casually. No. Tell me. I haven't seen you for two days. So.. ..I thought on the pretext of giving the tea, I would.. I am sorry, Charu. There is  lot of work and very less time. The newspaper's first publication will be out, the next week. My whole life is at stake. There are so many small things, which take up so much time. Don't worry. Once everything is fixed, it won't take so much time. You have become very lonely. What can I do? There is nothing to do. I count the time. The time doesn't pass. So, I start counting something else. Do you know, how many stairs are there are in our house? No. 115. There are 25 stairs inside. Charu, I understand. That's why, I have called your brother and sister-in-law. What can I talk to my sister-in-law about? She is not interested in music or literature. She can't speak about anything.. ..besides decking up and playing cards. Listen. I am thinking of learning music, again. Please, find me a teacher. Mr. Bhupati. Okay. I will see.
