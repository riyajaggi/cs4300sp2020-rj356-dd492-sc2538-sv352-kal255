 {\an8}Why are you ignoring me? {\an8}I really want to talk to you. Don't you want that, too? -No. That's not true. -So? {\an8}Is it because, I am a widow? {\an8}No. I never thought about it, in that way. You are not to blame, for what you are. Besides, you can do everything. The household chores, needlework, reading and writing. Everything. I don't even know the alphabet! So what? You are a married woman and so, you're blessed.

 You are very beautiful. You are equally beautiful. It is raining. I am not inferior. There is no comparison, between you and me. You are beautiful. I am better than you, in terms of beauty, virtue and talent. Mahendra wants that. A complete woman. He doesn't want a doll, who is displayed at home. You will help me, to get to Mahendra. Are you feeling shy? You must have moaned with pleasure, while it was happening. Disgusting! Don't you feel shy? Listen to yourself! You are the one doing it, while I should feel shy!

 You can share such things only with friends, right? Goddess Kali sent you for me. I can talk to you about things that, I can't even tell myself. Okay, listen. We should christen our friendship. -It will become stronger. -Is that so? What should we call each other? Ganga and Jamuna? No way! That is too dated. Well, then, the rose and the jasmine. Flowers wither away. I have a suggestion. Tell me. Constant irritant (Chokher Bali). An eyesore (Bali). An eyesore? I am your eyesore, as you are mine. Okay. Tell me something. You almost got married to Behari. What's the use of talking about these things? You almost got married to Behari too, didn't you? I was almost married to many men. I almost got married to your husband, too. If I had, this house and everything in it.. ..would have been mine. The bangles, the symbols of being a married woman.. ..were supposed to be worn by me. You have taken my place. My eyesore. Listen, Bali. I don't want you to break down mountains. I can break down mountains for you. But, I can't do this. Why not? I am a widow and I know my limits. These limits can include a friend, not her husband. I won't meet Mahen. Just meet Binodini, once. Why don't you meet her? Do you want me to meet her? -Aren't you afraid? -Afraid of what? You praised her so highly, any man might fall for her. Please, take me seriously, sometimes. Meet her, once. But, I just don't have any time! Once I am done studying, I am all yours. There is no room for anybody else. Then, stop meeting me. Oh, my God! You are too short tempered. Fine. I will meet her. Hurry up and give sir this letter, before he leaves. Go on, quickly. -Sir. Sir. -One moment. Sir, ma'am has sent this letter. Be careful. The piano is a very fragile instrument. Will you teach me, orally? -Play it and teach me. -Stop it! Bali, are you crazy? If anyone sees me playing the piano.. ..it will be a disaster. Who will see you? Mother? Nothing you do offends her. In fact, she will get irritated, if she sees me. I am going. There is lot of work to be done. Wait for a moment. Bali, why are you involving me in this? Why are you holding me back constantly, today? I want to see you play the piano. -No. Pronounce it correctly. -Okay. Fine. Come on. Play it. You carry on. I will be with you, soon. Hey! What is this? See you soon. Let me draw the curtains. -That's the right note. -Oh! Is that so? -May I? -Yes. "The realm of my prayer." "You exist beyond the realm of my prayer." "My melodies may touch your feet." "But, I am the traitor." "You exist beyond the realm of my prayer." Mahen. -Behari, I am here. -He is here. Will you have dinner? We have to go to the doctor's place for dinner. You are already eating here. He has just started eating. Now, please eat here. Exactly. He didn't even have lunch, today. First, his mother spoilt him. After that, his friend did. And then, his wife came along to pamper him. At least, you shouldn't pamper this spoilt brat. Bali, do you get the feeling that someone is envious? Behari wishes, that he was in my place. Yes. Wishing for something, is futile. You need to deserve it. Behari, say something. What can I say? At first sight, even a diamond may look like a stone. My friend has a discerning gaze. I may not be a good assessor.. ..but, somebody else is. Be patient. Forget about all this. Tell me. Is our picnic on Sunday confirmed? No. All three of you can go. Why? Come with us, Bali. It will be fun. What will the singers do, without their instruments? I will stay back. Without good music, the singers and the instruments are of no use. If Mr. Behari comes along, then I will come, too. No way. It's very difficult to persuade him. I will be there. Okay. This is a rook. The rook always moves in a straight line. -Like this. -Okay. Okay? This is the queen. The queen is the most crucial and cleverest player in chess. It's the queen's duty to save the king's life. She can even lay down her life, to save the king. Is that so? The queen can move anywhere, on the chess board. A queen can move forward or backward, to the left or right. A queen can do anything. But, that is possible only in a game, right? No. The game of chess is quite similar to life. Come on. Make your move. I've been wondering about the difference.. ..between you and Mr. Mahen. Since childhood. That's why, everybody calls him, Krishna and me, Sudama. No. You're not Sudama, in totality.. ..neither is he Krishna, in totality. Regardless of how he may appear on the outside.. ..he is very weak from within. And you appear very calm, on the outside. -But, from within.. -Yes? That's the first time, I have heard it. You can sit calmly for hours and wait for the fish. He can't do that. He doesn't need to wait. The fish gets lured by his bait. Is that what you think? What do you think? I believe, your patience may not be rewarded, immediately. But, once you are, the sweetness lasts for life. That means, I will have to wait for many years. The fish will come, when it wishes to. Just pray that in the meantime, there aren't.. ..too many ripples in the lake. The ripples can't be controlled by you, me, or the lake. You can't handle disdain, can you? Anyone who is disdainful to you, is doomed. Even if it is Krishna. Well, I didn't mention any names. That's what makes you special. You can read a woman's mind. Asha would have been perfect for you. But, Mahen wouldn't have been perfect for you. Why are you behaving like a kid? Can't you see, I am reading? Nonsense. Go to sleep. What are you looking for? I see. So finally, you have noticed me. -What has happened to you? -I can't find my book! Nothing has happened to me. Something has happened to you. I wonder, what's going on in that mind of yours? Don't enter my study, in future. Don't touch my things! Friends share each other's sorrow, don't they? Do you think, I don't care for Asha? Perhaps, I don't. Not as much as you. But, I do care. So, don't watch silently. Share her sorrow. Take care of your friend. If she were as intelligent and clever as you.. Then? Then, this wouldn't have happened. I was terribly hurt, that day. You were partial to Asha, too. Everybody was concerned about Asha. Whereas, she had deprived me of every joy. Even on that day, for the first time.. ..you loathed me, because of her. It's been six years. I can say it, now. I wasn't angry with you, because of Asha's woes. It was because of the intimacy, between you and Mahen. It came out the wrong way. My friendship with Mahen.. ..always deprived me of my joy. But, this is how I have been taking care.. ..of him right from the beginning, Bali. That is what I have done, since the first day of marriage. I know, my work is imperfect. But, my love is true. I want to go away from here. Don't talk about leaving, Bali. No. I want to leave. This is your house, now. He is your husband too, right? Bali, he won't be angry for too long. Be patient. Once he calms down, he will come back to you, on his own. Okay? Bali, don't cry. Stop it. What happened? Is everything all right? These days, nothing is all right in the house. What did Binodini say? She wants to leave. She won't stay here. She is being obstinate. She just won't listen. If she is around, she helps us with the household chores. I can't expect anything from anybody else. -Bali, I want to talk to you. -Only Asha can call me that. I can also call you by another name. Mr. Mahen, it's best, if certain things don't exist. You said mister, again! You can call me Mahen. Some things are impossible. Listen. This is very heavy. Please, help me. You are right. It's impossible for you to leave from here. Anyway, you will soon leave to go to college. How long can one dissect corpses? It's a unique pleasure to dissect the feelings of the living, right? Oh, my God! You are really angry. -Is that why you are leaving? -No. I am not angry. It is best, that I leave. Why should I stay here? Nobody loves me. Why? Basically, you have been talking to me, since so many days.. ..and you have been spending time with me.. ..but, you have not looked into my eyes, once. Look into my eyes. You will find the reason to stay on here. Please, don't go. Please. I have heard, that Asha is leaving. So? She can't think of anyone, besides you.. ..but, all of a sudden, she thought of her aunt. And it's so intense, that she can't stop herself. What does that mean? What do you want to say? Behari, just come out with it. You know what I am trying to say. At least, show Asha a little respect.. ..and drop her to her aunt's place, personally. You can't bear to see Asha suffer. Why is that so? And since when, Behari? Mahen, what's going on in your mind? Forget about my mind. I will tell you, what's going on in your mind. You think, I have sent Asha away.. ..so that, I can get a chance to spend time with Binodini. What can I say? You, yourself.. What can you say? I will tell you. You still want Asha. That's why, you are feeling bad, because Asha is leaving. Mahen, you have gone crazy. I am not crazy. You are accusing me.. ..so that, nobody will malign you. Mahen, you are absolutely wrong. I am not wrong. Actually, a man sees others, the way he is. You see the same thing, that's between you and Asha.. ..happening between Binodini and me. It is futile talking to you. Bali. I don't know, when I will return. Will you do me a favor, until then? What? He can never find his clothes, his shoes or books. Will you take care of him? -Bali.. -Don't refuse. You have heard everything, haven't you? Despite that, you still want me to take care of Mr. Mahen. That was said between two friends. This is between us. I trust you. You will take better care of him, than me. You will, won't you? Swear by the Goddess Kali. Since you have decided, I won't ask, why you are leaving. Still, I will tell you. I was living in this house, because of you. And I am leaving, because of you. Is that so? It is best, that the one who hinders your studies, stays away. You will have peace. You will be able to concentrate on your studies. "All that my heart wishes for." "You are the one. That you are." "All that my heart wishes for." "In this world, apart from you." "I have none, nothing I have." "All that my heart wishes for." "If it is happiness, that you seek.." "..go in search of happiness." "If it is happiness that you seek.." "..go in search of happiness." "I have you in my heart." "Nothing more do I desire." "All that my heart wishes for." "You are the one. That you are." "All that my heart wishes for." "You are the one. That you are." "In this world, apart from you.." "..I have none, nothing I have." "All that my heart wishes for." "Pining for you, in your absence.." "..I will live by your memories." "Through the eternal day and night." "Through the endless years and months." "If you do love someone else." "If never do you return." "Then whatever you covet, you should get that." "Let all the sufferings be mine." "All that my heart wishes for." "You are the one. That you are." "All that my heart wishes for." What happened? Whose letter arrived today? It's from Asha. How is my Chokher Bali? She will be back tomorrow morning. Ask her yourself. What happened? Why are you looking pale? You look pale, too. The color white can never turn pale, Mr. Mahen. Was our intimacy meant to be so short-lived? Perhaps. It's not dawn, yet. Listen to me. -No. -Wait. Nothing will happen. -Not at home. -Listen to me. -Leave me. What are you doing? -Mahen.. Mr. Behari. Mr. Behari, it's not what you think. If someone gives a justification, without being asked.. ..it means, he is at fault. It's not my fault. Mr. Behari.. ..when I saw the pain on your face that day.. ..I don't have words to tell you, how much it hurt me. All I will say is that, what you saw.. ..may be the whole truth, for you. But, it's half the truth for me. It's half the truth, as everything in a widow's life is incomplete. You will understand this, when you close your eyes.. ..and reflect on that scene. Because, when you will close your eyes.. ..only then, will the eyes of your mind would open. If you see me with the eyes of your mind.. ..you will find that, I am a hapless woman. I am not a sinner. -But, that letter.. -You never received it. I know. The person who shouldn't have got the letter, got hold of it. -Listen. -Yes. Come here. Yes? Bring me some tea. Listen. Listen. What is it? Where are you going? Ms. Binodini has given a letter for Mr. Behari. Mr. Behari is not at home. So, I was going to return it. Give it to me. You can go. What's the use of being upset with the one.. ..who is not favored by destiny? If possible, don't make our woes, yours. If you write even two lines, in reply to this letter.. ..I will assume, that you have ignored my mistakes. In Malda, so many things happened between us.. ..during a very short span of time. Don't forget that. That's what my feelings are.
