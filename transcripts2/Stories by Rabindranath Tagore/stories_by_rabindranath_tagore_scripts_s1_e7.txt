 -You are still not ready. -Yes. Just give me two minutes. Will it look good if the guests come and wait at the station? There is still time. The train arrives in the evening. We still have three hours. You won't leave on time, if I don't keep reminding you. The mattresses are here. -What should I do? -What? Keep them upstairs. -I want money. I have to buy sweets. -Oh yes. Wait. Give me Rs.20. It's to buy sweets. Give it to me, fast.

 Listen. Buy excellent sweets. -Okay? -Yes. I knew that you won't get the lights installed. Fine. Fine. We will install the lights. Just stop insisting on having shehnai musicians from Banaras. But, everybody knows that.. ..we are calling the musicians from Banaras. How will I face everyone? How does that matter? Tell everyone that we ran out of money. And I refused, flatly! But.. Listen, we have just one daughter. Come on, Vimla. Vimla, don't start crying.

 I have been deep into the accounts, since morning. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Look at this! Look at the train fare and the expenses for the lodge. This is for the lights. -Listen, Vimla. You.. -But.. I don't have any money left. But, we were saving up for this day, since years! Vimla, listen to me. We are doing as much as we can. I am not a businessman. I am a writer. A writer, whose books are not selling these days. Okay. Aren't marriages conducted without musicians? I will refuse. -Sir. -Yes. Rahmat. Come. Come. Come in. Come in. It's been so many years. 10 years! No. 8 years, 7 months and 21 days. Rahmat, where were you for so long? I was released from the prison, last evening. I thought, I would meet Mini. Rahmat.. There is a veneration at home, today. Many people have come from out of town. We won't get the time, today. Let's do it some other day. -Father. Father, it's the guard.. -Mini. I told her, that you are working. She doesn't listen. It's okay. If Mini can't disturb me, who else can? Right? Okay. Tell Bhola to send some tea, please. Bhola has gone to the market. He may get late. -Is that so? -Yes. -Why? -No. It's okay. It's okay. I started the 17th chapter. I thought, if I could get tea.. So, you have started the 17th chapter? Okay. You must know where King Pratap's lover is hidden. I do know. But, I don't know, what he will do next. It means, until you get tea, you won't be able to proceed. Really! If I get some tea, my work will get done faster. I will send it. Father, the guard Ram Dayal, addresses crows as black birds. He doesn't know anything, right? No, dear. You shouldn't say that. Ram Dayal is from another state. -And in that state.. -Father, Bhola says.. ..there are elephants in the clouds. When they blow out water with their trunks, it rains. No. Bhola is wrong. Science says, the season changes the direction of the wind changes. Father, what is the relationship between you and mother? What? Answer her. Tell her. What can I say? Come on. Go and play. -No. I will sit here. -Hey! Okay. Fine. I will answer that. Your mother and I are, husband and wife. Why? Why isn't she your sister? Why isn't she my sister? Answer her. I won't say anything. Go and play outside with Bhola. -Come on. -No. I will sit right here. Your father is working. Come on. Let's go out. No. Father is not working. He is talking to me. Come on. Let's go out. -Play with Bhola. Come on. -Okay. Fine. -We will play later. Okay? -Fine. Dry fruits for sale! Almonds, pistachios for sale. Dry fruits for sale. Dry fruits for sale. Almonds and pistachios for sale. Dry fruits for sale. Dry fruits for sale. Dry fruits for sale. Ma'am.. Almonds, pistachios and raisins for sale. Dry fruits for sale. Dry fruits for sale. Almonds, pistachios and raisins. Kabuliwalah (man from Kabul)! Kabuliwalah! Little girl. Do you want to eat dry fruits? Hello, sir. Sir, someone called me. Okay. Wait. Mini, you called someone, didn't you? There are children in his bag. It's not like that. When you call someone, you should go out to meet him. -Come. -No. -Are you selling something? -Yes, sir. Almonds, pistachios and raisins. What do you want, sir? -Give me a packet of almonds. -Okay. -Where are you from? Kabul? -No. From Kandahar. From Kandahar. Do you speak Pashto? -Yes, sir. -Okay. Just hold on. Kandahar has been named after Alexander the great. From Alexanderia, it changed to Kandahar. Yes. Money. Sir, you know everything. I swear. You seem to be a wise man. No. It's not like that. Tell me something. -Your ruler, Abdur Rahman.. -Yes. What is your opinion about him? I mean, is he a good ruler? Or is he a puppet of the British? Sir, I am a small time trader. I don't understand politics. But yes. Due to his negotiation with the British.. ..people like me come here and do smalltime business. Because, it's very difficult to grow anything in my country. You are an optimist. I am a trader, sir. I live away from my country and my home. I have come here to earn a decent living. If I get that, that's enough. I don't care about politics. Sir, I don't have change. Yes. No problem. Give me something else in return. Fine, sir. I have got something special for you, sir. -Something special? -Yes, sir. -Delicious raisins. -Thank you. Sir, where is the little girl? -Girl? -That little girl. Mini? -Wait for two minutes. I will call Mini. -Okay. Mini. Mini, listen. When you call someone, you should go out and meet him. -Little girl. -Mini. He has something for you. Look. She is very shy. It's okay. It's natural at this age. Okay. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Mini. That's not done. When you call out to someone by his name.. ..you should go and meet him. All right? Go and play. Kabuliwalah! Kabuliwalah! This is rice. This is lentil. This is a vegetable curry and this is fish. -Little girl, what is this? -Fish. Fish. Fish. You do eat it, don't you? -I don't eat fish. -You should eat it. It's good for the eyes. -Don't keep giving her stuff! -Hey! -Look, don't give it to her. -Here, dear. Eat cashew nuts. -Little girl, eat raisins. -Okay. -Eat pistachios. -Okay. Here's 25 pence. Eat it, dear. Eat it. Eat the almonds. You like it, don't you? You enjoy it, don't you? Eat some more, dear. Mr. Praful, this is the final draft of the new novel. I promised to submit it today. So, here it is. Fine. You write really well. -You are talented. -Thank you. And it's so real. As if you are living the character. But, can I tell you something,  Mr. Indranath? Yes. Your first novel was super successful. But, I can't guarantee how successful.. ..your second book will be. Okay. I have told you so many times, not to talk to strangers. You don't listen to me at all. Where did you get the 25 pence from? Tell me. Where did you get it from? Mother, the Kabuliwalah gave me the money. So, I took it. The Kabuliwalah gave it and you took it. Oh, God! Anybody will give you anything. Will you take it? -Yes. -Why are you scolding her? Oh God! What do I do with this girl? I gave him 25 pence. He must have returned it to her. Nothing else. What is this? Wow! I will talk to him. So, you knew about this? He came in the morning. I bought some dry fruits from him. And I paid him for it. That's it. Why did he return it? Listen, I don't know about all this. I just don't want to see that man near my little girl. What difference does it make, if he comes here? Every day? Do you know that? Ask your darling daughter. He comes and sits there, every day. -I wonder why. -Okay. Fine. All right. I will talk to Mini. Mini, the Kabuliwalah comes every day. Why is that so? Yes. He brings dry fruits for me. And he listens to my interesting stories. Yes. But Mini, I gave him 25 pence. Why did you take it? I tell him stories. I told him. If he likes my stories, he will have to pay me. So, he paid me. That means, you earned 25 pence for telling him stories? Yes. I see. Mini, can I say something? When you become a great writer.. ..you will publicize your books better than me. Tell me the truth, Kabuliwalah. What is in your bag? There is a big elephant in my bag. -A big elephant, in that bag? -Yes. Does he eat, bathe and do everything in this bag? Yes. Doesn't your bag get dirty? No. My bag never gets dirty. Look, it's so fragrant. See? It's so dirty. Tomorrow, I will bring a scented one for you. Okay? Little girl, when will you go to your in-law's house? You go to your in-law's house. How can I go? Listen, if your in-laws trouble you.. ..I will beat them up. Like this. Like this. I wonder, where Bhola has gone? Listen, don't go out to play if Bhola is not around. I wonder why you call these beggars home! He is not a beggar. -He is the Kabuliwalah. -Quiet! He is the Kabuliwalah, it seems! Kabuliwalah! Kabuliwalah! Did you read that book? -Was it nice? -Beware of that man. I'm warning you. -Which man? -The Pathan. Who else? He has become too friendly with Mini. I don't like that at all. There is no need to worry. Nothing will happen. Vimla, you haven't seen both of them, together. I have seen them together. He sits at Mini's feet, humbly. I can guarantee, that, he won't harm Mini at all. But, she might harm him. You are saying weird things. Has a girl never been kidnapped? Aren't people bought and sold in Kabul? Isn't slavery still prevalent over there? Is it unreasonable for a mother to think.. ..that somebody might kidnap her little child? No, Vimla. Listen, you are not wrong. I also admit that, it's not impossible. But, the possibility of it happening, is very less. I see. So now, we should wait for the moment.. ..when that possibility becomes likely. And for a tragedy to occur. It's wrong to be cautious, before that. Listen, you don't understand me at all. Vimla, I know that man. Nothing of that sort will happen. Fine. Do whatever you want. If anything untoward happens, don't say, that I didn't warn you. -What are you doing, Mini? -I am praying. Why are you praying? I am telling the Kabuliwalah's God to send him, quickly. Didn't the Kabuliwalah come today? Yes, perhaps he has returned to his country. Without informing me? It's not possible. He can't go anywhere without informing me. Come and have lunch. Mini, your mother is calling you for lunch. I don't want to eat food. -What do you want to eat? -Dry fruits. Do you want to eat dry fruits? Okay. Do one thing. Go and eat a little to please your mother. Okay. I will sit here and tell the Kabuliwalah's God.. ..to send him quickly. With lots of dry fruits. Say it now, in front of me. Now? In front of you? Fine. I will say it, now. You know how to pray like him, don't you? You did it just now. I learnt it from you. Okay? You go downstairs. I will do it. Officer, what happened? -Do you know Mr. Shyam? -Yes. -He bought a Pashmina shawl from him. -Okay. He said, he will pay him later. -When it was time to make the payment.. -Okay. ..he denied it. He said, he never bought the shawl. Both of them had a fight. And he attacked him in a rage. Sir, he is a demon! He is a dishonest man. Shame on him. Take him. Take him. Kabuliwalah! Kabuliwalah! Where are you going? Little girl. I am going to my in-law's house. I will go there and beat up my father-in-law. Bring him along. Come on. It's been more than eight years, right? Sir.. ..I want to see the little girl, once. No. It's not possible, today. Many people have come from out of town. The veneration is going on. Rahmat, it won't be possible. Fine, sir. I will leave. Goodbye. Goodbye. Take care. Sir.. ..I brought this gift for her. Give it to her. Listen to me, Rahmat. There is no need for this. No, sir. If you give it to her, I will be happy. Okay. Wait. Wait. -Here. -No, sir. I don't need this. -Listen, Rahmat. Still.. -No, sir. I told you. No, sir. Praise the Lord! You are very generous. Just keep me in your prayers. Your little girl is my little girl. I see my daughter's face, when I see your daughter. I don't give her dry fruits, to earn a profit. Look at this, sir. These are the palm prints of my little girl. I always keep it with me. Okay, sir. Goodbye. Rahmat. Rahmat. Rahmat, come. Come in. Have a seat. I will be back, very soon. -Vimla. -Yes. I want to take Mini outside for five minutes. Why? I want her to meet someone. But, it's time and she is getting ready. It makes no difference. -But.. -Vimla. Come along, Mini. I will send her back in five minutes. Come on. -Rahmat. -Yes. She is your little Mini. Kabuliwalah. Kabuliwalah. My goodness! My little girl has grown up. My Sana must have also grown up. Little girl. You will go to your in-law's house. May God protect you! Rahmat. Goodbye. Go, Rahmat. Go home. Sir.. ..for that, I will have to work. I will have to stay here. Rahmat, stay here for two minutes. Just two minutes. -Rahmat, here. Take this. -No, sir. -Rahmat. -No, sir. I don't need this. Rahmat, I know you don't need this. Keep it. Go home and meet your Sana. No, sir. The little girl is getting married. Rahmat, I will manage that. Okay. Consider it a loan. You can repay it, once you return after meeting Sana. -No, sir. I don't need this. -Rahmat. You have to take this for your little girl. Go.. ..and meet Sana. Goodbye. Sir. Goodbye. Come with me. It's so beautiful. -Very beautiful. -What? Nothing. I was saying.. ..that, it's such a beautiful place. That's true. Do you know, why I brought you here? Because, this place is close to my heart. Whenever brother was busy fulfilling his responsibilities.. ..this place would alleviate my loneliness.. ..in joy, as well as sorrow. But now, I don't need this place. Because, you are with me. I promise you. I will never leave you. Our life will flow smoothly with time. And like the banks of this river.. ..we will never leave each other. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Mini, my jacket. Thank you. -My pen. -Yes. I will bring it at once. Handkerchief? I will bring it, right away. Mukul, go and give this to your uncle. Okay? Give this to me. I see. So, this is what is going on here.
