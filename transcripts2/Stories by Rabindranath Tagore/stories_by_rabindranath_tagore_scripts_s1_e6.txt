 Brother, I really want to wear the uniform, some day. What are you wearing right now? A blanket? No, no, I meant like the one you're wearing. The one that seniors wear. Well, it does have its perks. Listen to this piece of news. A shopkeeper in Makura got into an argument with his friend. And in a fit of rage, the friend killed his friend, the shopkeeper. And he must have surrendered, as well. That isn't a crime. Such people are miscreants, they are not criminals.

 You know, Manik, my dream is to.. ..meet a high-class criminal, some day. Someone who will compel me to think beyond the obvious. Father used to say.. 'Whatever you do, do it better than anyone else.' 'It doesn't matter whether someone's watching or not.' 'Your duty, your presentation..' '..has to be infallible. Complete!' 'And it should be the best.' I've always believed in these words. Pour me some more tea. When I got this government job, I made up my mind.. ..that, I want to be a detective. But, a detective who's beyond comparison.

 Like the ones in Scotland Yard, in London. Have you heard about Kalamin? Roderick Alleyn, Sherlock Holmes. Sam Spade. But, the problem is.. ..the people in this country, have a heart of gold. They think straight. They commit a crime and get caught the very same day! There's no fun in that. No crooked plots, no cruelty. In a society where everyone's guilty.. ..it's a crime to get caught. Isn't it? I'm looking for a criminal, who's clever.. ..cunning.. ..and who has qualities like.. What's wrong? Wait. He's just a radio artist. Let's go. Come on! Let it be, I'll wear it myself. Why? Don't you like me giving you a hand? You know, I like doing this. Tell me something. You don't stay here for weeks and months, together. And I'm all alone at home. Don't you ever have doubts on me? It's my profession to doubt people. It's my job. And I don't bring my work home. But, I do have doubts about you. I mean, since I stay alone.. ..many suspicious thoughts cross my mind. It's become a hobby of sorts. By the way, should I have any reason to doubt you? Detecting the detective, right? Das, what are you... Pardon me, I thought you're my friend, Mr. Das. Pardon me, please. His name is Manmoto Majumdar. He studies in Hindu College. Philosophy. He failed his exams this year. The summer vacations have begun.. ..but, he hasn't gone home yet. Why? What's he busy with? He cannot be a run of the mill student. Everyone's gone, why did he stay back? Alone! What conspiracy is he devising in his mind? Why didn't he go home? Why does he want to stay alone? Questions! Questions! And more questions. Manmoto seems really interesting, Mohim. In order to understand a criminal.. ..it's important to understand his customs. That is, you start thinking like he does.. ..and start making the same moves as him. Hello. I am Sathyaki Rai Chaudhary. Well, Siddheshwar must have told you about me. -Yes, are you the new tenant? -Yes. -Yes. -Come in. -Do you need anything? -No. Nothing. Where are my manners? Please come in, take a seat. Come in. So, where are you from? I am definitely not from Siliguri. He's clever. He didn't avoid my question or tell me about his whereabouts. And where are you from, Sathyaki? -Kolkata. -I see. I had to come down here for some work. My office is nearby. I work in an insurance company. Oh, you are into service. Public service. And.. ..what do you do? I am a student. -I study at the Hindu College. -Okay. Philosophy. But, I couldn't pass my exams this year. That's all right. Everyone gets a second chance. But, aren't your summer vacations on, now? Everyone's gone home. And you're still here. -What will I do back home, Sathyaki? -Yes. Well, I must take your leave. -It was nice meeting you. -Okay. -Bye. -Bye. I hope, you've no problems eating meat? Who are you? Who are you, Mr. Manmoto? A connoisseur of good food. I can see that. Please eat. Manmoto. Can I say something? I hope, you won't tell anyone. What is it, Sathyaki? Have you ever been in love? What kind of a question is that? No, well.. ..there is a girl in my office. She is very beautiful. I really like her. I think, I am in love with her. But, it is hard to say.. ..whether, she loves me or not. -Does she work in your office? -Yes. That is the problem. She is always in front of my eyes, so close to me. And yet, so far. Honestly speaking, Sathyaki, this is nothing new. That's how, God made relationships between man and woman. So that, whenever someone is afflicted by love.. ..others can laugh at him. They make a mockery of him. You know, the more love you have in your heart.. ..the more it hurts. But, that is the law of nature. That's really deep. It seems like you are in love, too. Isn't it? Isn't it? It is a long story. -Maybe some other time. -Why some other time? Tell me, now. Look, there's a lot that can be said about this topic. -So, not today. -But, at least.. Nothing? He's very complicated. It's not that easy to crack him. I've already made my next move. I used an agent provocateur. What kind of agent provocateur? A woman! A woman? Manik. Two people can become friends, easily. But, unless they discuss matters of the heart.. ..their friendship doesn't grow deep. I told him a secret. A love story. Fictitious. It was mine. I trusted him. So now, he will trust me. Right? I can never understand your mysteries. Manik, if only you had been there, you'd see. -I cooked up a love-story in an instant. -Yes. It was full of love, pain, emotions, everything! Closer. After a while, I was so proud of my creation.. ..it made me feel like some great actor. Mohim Chandra Giribala. Giribala? Giribala! Why? -Nonsense. Giribala. -Did I say something amusing? Eat slowly. The food isn't going anywhere. If you like home-made food so much.. ..then, why don't you stay at home? I won't try to stop you.. ..but at least, tell me where you've been living.. ..and what have you been doing? I'll tell you. When the time's right, I'll tell you. I see and when will it be the right time? Soon. I've made considerable progress.. ..in the new case that I've been investigating. Have faith in me, Indu. I'm just doing my job. You know.. ..I am right. A new wife? Teach her to cook like you. What happened? Your moustache! When the time is right.. ..I'll tell you, everything. Okay? Manmoto. What's wrong? Nothing. I mean, you're very quiet these days. Is everything okay? I'm absolutely fine, Sathyaki. Did you read this news? About the three revolutionaries who have been caught. I don't think, they've been caught yet. I am sure, they surrendered for a reason. -Really? -Yes. -Some tea? -No, thank you. My friend Manmoto.. ..has been spending a lot of his time behind closed doors. I wonder, what secret agenda he has. But, he doesn't know it, either. The truth is, a secret is just another word for me. That's all. No need to talk too much. We need to learn the truth about Manmoto. We need to find out, why.. -Harimati. -Yes? What's wrong? Are you okay? Everything's fine. No. Honestly speaking, Mohim.. ..I wonder why, I am really excited! Even my ears have turned red. Harimati, we need to expose Manmoto. I hope, you don't reveal your identity in your excitement. Be careful. I'll take your leave. Didn't he leave a bit too early? Let's go. See, Harimati. Didn't I tell you? This is where we'll find him. Let's go. Can't we wait a little longer? Mohim, there's something I want to tell you. I know it's wrong and it's against the norms of the society. But I must tell you, Mohim. -I'm in love with someone. Secretly. -What? -I am in love, Mohim. -But, this is wrong. -Socially unacceptable. -Why, Mohim? Why does everything have to end like this? Why does society stop us from doing these things? Because I am married. I have a wife. -I was talking about Manmoto. -What? It has just been three days, since their capture. And Golbari Police Station is already facing a lot of heat.. ..because of the break. Not only so, the 'Trio' as they're being called now.. ..also took with them, as a parting gift.. ..whatever they might from the police station. 15 guns, are told to be missing. Along with 300 rounds of ammunition. I don't think, they've been caught yet. I am sure, they surrendered themselves for a reason. Manmoto. Harimati wants to come here. -Forever? -No, no. Just like that. To see how we stay, and in what condition. She was saying, we should all go out for dinner. I see. One more thing. I told her everything. About me. About my feelings. Clearly. In no uncertain terms. She said, she'll think about it. -Good. -Isn't it? I've invited her over on Friday at 9 p.m. Is that okay? Manmoto. It's okay, Sathyaki. -How about some tea? -Yes, of course. Manmoto. I am going out.. ..to pick up Harimati. I thought, I should ask. Would you like anything to eat? Cutlets. Fried snacks. Sweets. No, thank you. You can go. I have a stomach ache. -I'll go get some medicines. -Okay. May I leave? Yes. Okay. Mohim. Nilakshi, I told you, I have evidence. You said, you don't even talk to Harimati. Nilakshi, I guess you've forgotten all about.. ..Manmoto, with whom you spent your childhood. But, he never forgot you. We used to be best friends. I admit, our childhood days ended lot earlier. But, those sounds of bliss and happiness.. ..still resonate in my ears. I don't know whether you know this.. ..but one day, when I ran out of patience.. ..I spoke to your father about marrying you. We were of the same age.. ..that's why our family were against our relationship. A few days later, you got married and left. For years, there was no news about you. Then one day, I found out that your husband.. ..was transferred to Siliguri. That was all. I came here too, looking for your home. Meeting you is my impossible intention. And God is my witness.. ..that I don't want to create any interference in your marriage. In the evening, I position myself.. ..under the lamp post near your house. Every evening at 7, you sanctify your entire home.. ..with the holy lamp, while looking towards the South. That single, invaluable scene mesmerized me. And I started coming every day, to witness it. That is my only mistake, when it comes to you. Coincidentally, do you know what happened? Your husband and I became close friends. Hello. Who are you, Monmoto? A connoisseur of good food. And during my interaction with him.. ..I understood that you're not happy with him. Can I say something? Well, there's a girl in my office. I know, that I've no right over you, socially. But honestly, your sorrow has become my pain. And all I can do is try to relieve your pain. There's been a murder, Mohim. Mohim. With great courage, I'm making a request. Please, don't mind. Can you secretly come to my place on Friday, at 8 p.m.? I want to tell you something important about your husband. Things that a wife should know about her husband. If you don't believe me, I've evidence for you. Evidence, that your husband will bring along himself. -Tea! -No, thank you. I know, it's difficult for you to believe a stranger. So, I suggest that you give this letter to your husband. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen.. I'll tell him whatever he needs to know about himself. Listen. Always your well-wisher. Monmoto Majumdar. Mohim, I need your signature. You see, he's being released today. Hello, sir. Let's go. Hello, sir. Okay, sir. Goodbye. Palto, where is your uncle? Here I am. In the study.
