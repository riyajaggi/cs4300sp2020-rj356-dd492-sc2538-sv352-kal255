 "To my dear husband,
 "I should like Miss Margaret
Schlegel to have Howards End."
 Your mother cannot have been
herself when it was written.
 Oh, what an age it has been since
I last saw you, Mr Wilcox. He is
a beast, he has no human feeling.
 He's not a beast!
I thought him rather splendid.
 You do love me, don't you?
I've said so, haven't I?
 Only it's not right
we keep pretending.
 We've just come across a young
fellow who's evidently very poor.
 Now, how should such
a man be helped?
 Porphyrion is a bad, bad concern.
 A friend of ours said that
it was bound to smash by Easter.
Where are you going?
 What do you want to have
me in there for?
 It's only a letter reminding us
that we have until May to clear out.
 "I have decided to give up
the house in Ducie Street..."
 "..and to let it out on
a yearly tenancy."
 Shall I say yes or shall I say no?
 Say yes. Say no.
 That's decided, then.
 I think our race is degenerating.
 We cannot settle even this
little thing.
 What will it be like
when we have to settle a big one?
 It's the little things
one bungles at.
 The big, real ones
are nothing when they come.
 I was thinking of Father,
 having to leave Germany at 40,
adopt a new country
 and new ideals.
 And we, at our age,
can't even change houses.
 I wish you'd come with me.
 No. I'd rather leave it to you.
 But you won't do anything rash,
will you, Margaret?
 There's nothing rash to do.
 This is awfully kind,
but I'm afraid it's not going to do.
 The house has not been built that
suits the Schlegel family.
 What, have you come determined
not to deal? Not exactly.
 Not exactly? Well, in that case,
let's be starting.
 Is this a new motor car,
Mr Wilcox? Yes.
 Presumably, it's very beautiful.
How do you like it, Crane?
 Very much, Ma'am.
 Is it a steam car?
 No, no. I don't hold
with steam engines.
 No, of course not. There's no
thingummy. But aren't they faster?
 I read... They are just now...
Not for long, no, but...
 Crane, thank you.
 But the potentialities of
the internal combustion engine
are infinite...
 No future in the steam car, Miss.
Crane! Beg your pardon, sir. May I?
 No, thank you. I can manage.
No, nonsense! Let me help you. Um...
 So how on earth did you know
my chauffeur was called Crane?
 Oh, I know Crane.
I've been driving with Mrs Wilcox.
 I know you have
a housekeeper called Mazy.
 I know all sorts of things.
 How does Evie do?
 Oh, Evie? Oh, you won't see her.
She's gone out with Cahill.
 I tell you, it's no fun,
being left so much alone.
 I have my work all day,
 but I come home in the evening and
I can't stand the house, I tell you.
 In my absurd way, I'm lonely too.
 It's heart-breaking, having to
leave one's old home.
 I scarcely remember
anything before Wickham Place.
 Helen and Tibby were born there,
and Helen says...
 You too feel lonely?
 Horribly.
 ENGINE STARTS
 You were just saying, sorry? Oh,
just some rubbish about furniture.
 Ha!
 Well, you're not
as unpractical as you pretend.
 I shall never believe that.
Oh, but I am quite as unpractical.
 At all events, you responded
to my letter very promptly.
 Oh, well, I know a good thing
when I see it.
 I want to go over the whole house.
 And as soon as I get back to Wickham
Place, I'll talk it over with
 Helen and Tibby,
and then write to you yes or no.
 Right. The entrance hall.
 It's paved. Yes.
 And that's the Bible that Charles
brought back from the Boer War.
 Mm!
 Here we fellows smoke.
 Oh, jolly!
 HE CHUCKLES
 You do like it? It's all rubbish,
not making oneself comfortable.
 Isn't it? Yes.
Are these Cruikshanks?
 Gillrays.
 Shall we go upstairs?
 Hm!
 Does all this furniture
come from Howards End?
 No, all the Howards End furniture
has gone to the house in Oniton.
 Does... I'm so sorry.
 However, I'm concerned with
the house, not the furniture.
 How big is this drawing room?
 Um, 30 by 22. Oh, no, wait a minute.
 22 and a half.
 Shall we... Miss Schlegel? Yes?
 Miss Schlegel.
 I've had you here on
false pretences.
 I want to speak to you about a much
more serious matter than a house.
 I know. I mean...
 You know?
 No, I mean, I... I mean...
 Miss Schlegel.
 Yes?
 Could you be induced to share my...
 Is it probable...
Mr Wilcox, I see, I see.
 I will write to you afterward,
if I may.
 Miss Schlegel...Margaret...Miss
Schlegel, no, you don't understand.
 Oh, yes! Indeed, yes.
 I am asking you to be my wife.
 I know. I did think...
 I know. You aren't offended?
 How could I be offended?
 I... Mr Wilcox...
I am not of your set.
 No, you're not.
And I am much older than you.
 Yes, you are. But I...
 Mr Wilcox,
you quite take my breath away.
 There's no need to
advance your cause.
 I thought perhaps there might be.
 Oh, no, indeed.
 Well.
 Well.
 Shall we tour the rest of the house?
 Perhaps not today. Of course.
 You will have a letter from me.
 We go down to Swanage
to my aunt's tomorrow.
 Thank you.
 Goodbye.
 And it's you I thank.
 If it is to be no,
you may say so at once.
 But I don't... And if it is,
 you can depend on my letting you
the house under the same conditions.
 I didn't mean to imply that
I had deceived you on that.
 Of course not.
 And you should deal only with
the house agent directly.
 I would never dream of
intruding myself in the person
 of a landlord under...well,
under circumstances which you
might find awkward,
 should the circumstances be.
But you see what I mean?
 Certainly, I do.
But I'm not thinking of that.
 Right.
 I may order the motor car round?
 That would be most kind.
 Just one question.
 Oh, I do wonder. I do wonder
whether she's taken the house.
 I hope she hasn't been hasty.
 So do I. So do I.
 FRONT DOOR OPENS
 Have you got the house?
Thank you, Annie.
 Have you got the house?
 Oh, what a nuisance!
So we're as we were?
 Not exactly.
 Some mystery. We're to be
enlightened presently.
 Aunt Juley,
will you ask Annie to make the tea?
 We have to talk houses,
and we'll be down afterward.
 Mr Wilcox has made me
an offer of marriage.
 HELEN SIGHS
 It's just like a widower.
They've cheek enough for anything,
 and invariably select one of their
first wife's friends. That type...
 But you've never conceivably...
You never...
 HELEN GASPS
Oh, really!
 Don't, don't, don't! Meg,
don't do such a thing!
 I tell you not to! I know... Don't!
 What do you know? Don't!
 We would still see each other
very often, and... It's not a
thing like that!
 What has happened to you?
 Meg...
 Look here, sit down!
 I'll sit down if you sit down.
 It is a wonderful feeling, knowing
a real man cares for you.
 And remember, I have known and
liked him for a long while now.
 But loved him?
 No.
 But you will?
 Yes. Of that I'm pretty sure.
 And have settled to marry him?
 I had. What is it against him?
 Helen, you must try and say.
 It's ever since Paul.
 What has Mr Wilcox to do with Paul?
But he was there.
 They were all there that morning
when I came down to breakfast.
 I saw that Paul was so frightened -
all his paraphernalia had fallen
 so that I knew it was impossible -
because personal relations
 are the important thing, not this
outer life of telegrams and anger.
 I know Mr Wilcox's faults.
He's afraid of emotion.
 He cares too much about success,
too little about the past.
 I'd even say, spiritually,
he's not as honest as I am.
 Doesn't that satisfy you?
 No, it doesn't.
It makes me feel worse and worse.
 You must be mad!
 I don't intend him, or any man or
any woman, to be all my life.
 There are heaps of things
in me that he doesn't,
 and never shall, understand.
 And so, with him,
there are heaps of things in him -
 more especially things he does -
which will always be hidden from me.
 He has all those public qualities
that you so despise
 and enable all of this.
 More and more do
I refuse to draw my income
 and sneer at those who guarantee it.
 I don't intend to correct him
or to reform him.
 Only connect.
 That is the whole of my sermon.
 I have not undertaken to fashion
a husband to suit myself...
 ..using Henry's soul
as raw materials.
 It would be contemptible and unfair.
 SHE SIGHS
 One would lose something.
 Oh, look, he's here!
He's here! Hello! Hello!
 Hello, Mr Wilcox!
 Well, well, well! All of you!
Congratulations! How very nice!
 Mrs Munt, how do you do?
How do you do? Helen. Mr Schlegel.
 Oh, come along, Henry.
Where are you staying, Mr Wilcox?
 I've engaged a room at the Grand.
I'm told it's the best hotel now.
 It's the biggest.
 No, but the old Victoria's gone down
a little in the last ten years.
 But you will lunch with us,
though, Henry? Of course,
of course, of course!
 If you're interested in archaeology,
there's a pretty decent sort of
Roman ruin that they've excavated.
 Oh, yes? Wonderful.
 Lunch!
 I was thinking, if you don't mind,
 that we ought to spend this
afternoon in a business talk.
 I think so, too.
 How did you get on with Tibby
during cigarettes after lunch?
 Oh, very well. Oh, I am glad.
What did you talk about?
 Me, presumably? No, Greece.
 Oh, good!
Tibby's terribly keen on the Greeks.
 Yes, I have shares in
a currant farm in Kalamata.
 Ha! What a delightful thing
to have shares in!
 Can't we go there for our honeymoon?
What to do?
 To eat the currants.
Isn't there marvellous scenery?
 Moderately. It's not
the sort of place one could
possibly take a lady.
 Why not? There's no hotels.
 Some ladies do without hotels.
 Are you aware that Helen and I
walked alone over the Apennines
 with the luggage on our backs?
 No, I was not aware,
and, if I can manage it,
 I will make sure that you
never do such a thing again.
 You haven't found time for a talk
with Helen yet, I suppose?
 No. Do, before you leave.
 I'm so anxious the two of you
should be friends.
 Your sister and I have
always hit it off.
 Yes.
 Haven't you got anything
besides Ernest Pike?
 Helen, come and play Bezique.
Margaret will be home soon.
 I wonder what they're
talking about. Shares.
 He is winning Margaret body
and soul, like Othello.
 Only instead of disastrous chances
 and hair-breadth scapes
i' the imminent deadly breach,
 Mr Wilcox is telling her about his
adventures in mustard production.
 Does Mr Wilcox make mustard?
How extraordinary.
 Mr Wilcox is in rubber.
African rubber.
 Yes, but
he's got shares in everything.
 I don't think I should feel
comfortable owning shares in rubber.
 One feels so badly for the natives.
 But you have got shares in rubber,
Aunt Juley. We all have.
 Do we? I hadn't the smallest notion.
 I can write to your broker
if you want to sell them.
 I...
 I don't know.
 I suppose we shall have to
have Caruso.
 Oh, Tibby, can't we have
something a bit more jolly?
 RECORD PLAYS
 JAUNTY SINGING IN ITALIAN
 You know that Evie is going to marry
Percy Cahill, Dolly's uncle,
 who must have a suitable provision.
Of course.
 And Paul is struggling
away in Africa. Yes.
 Charles and Dolly have an increasing
family, and increasing expenses.
 Poor fellow!
 Charles will someday
inherit Howards End.
 But I am anxious,
in my own happiness,
 not to be unjust to
my other children.
 Oh, you mean money! How stupid I am.
 Yes, of course not.
 Yes, since you put it so frankly.
 I'm determined to be just to them,
and just to you.
 Be generous to them. Bother just.
 I've already written to
Charles to that effect.
 How much have you got?
 What? My... What, my income?
 Yes, how much a year? I've got 600.
 I must say you're
a downright young woman.
 What a question to
spring on a fellow!
 Well, don't you know
your own income?
 Or don't you want to tell it me?
 Well... It's all right.
Don't tell me. I don't want to know.
 But won't Charles
come into the business someday?
 In the usual way, he would.
 But I have raised Charles, and
the others, to be self-sufficient.
 If Charles can show an aptitude
for business sufficient to safeguard
 the company, and my other interests,
and everything that involves -
 well, then, yes, he should be
the proper person to succeed me.
 If not, well...
 The fact is, my dear, I hadn't
any intention of bothering you
 with the details. I just wanted
to let you know...
 Yes, we've settled all that.
 Go ahead, give away
as much as you can,
 bearing in mind I've a clear 600.
 There's one other point,
 and then I must go back to the hotel
and write some letters. Hmm?
 What's to be done
now about the house in Ducie Street?
 I don't expect
we'll want to live there.
 It'll be a little crowded
with your brother and your sister,
 too, and your aunt visiting.
Oh, yes.
 I don't know where Helen and Tibby
will want to live in the end.
 It depends.
When do you want to marry me?
 Getting' a bit hot, eh?
 I say! It doesn't matter, Henry.
 MEN LAUGH
 Evie will probably be
married in April.
 We could scarcely
think about anything before then.
 What about April for us too?
 THEY TALK, INDISTINCTLY
 I could have managed
perfectly well alone, Henry.
 You'll miss the post.
 That's a fine start,
if your aunt saw you walk in alone.
 I always go about alone.
 Considering I galloped
over the Apennines...
 Oh, dear! I'm sorry! Sorry.
 It's only common sense.
 Margaret...
 Goodbye.
 Goodbye, my dear.
 Miss Schlegel has got us
fairly on toast, thanks to you.
 I? I could scratch
that woman's eyes out.
 And to say it's my fault
is most unfair.
 Rum-ti-foo, rackety-tackety Tompkin!
 Father would have never dreamt
marrying as long as Evie was
 there to make him comfortable.
 But you must needs
start match-making
 and ask my sister down
to meet your Uncle Percy,
 and send them out in the motor car,
day after day.
 I am not responsible for
what Uncle Percy does,
 nor for anybody else or anything,
so there.
 Oh, well! We're in a bad hole
 and must make the most of it.
 I shall answer
the pater's letter civilly
 but I do not intend to forget
these Schlegels in a hurry.
 Tootle, tootle!
Dolly, are you listening?
 Yes, I'm listening.
 As long as they're on their best
behaviour, we'll behave too.
 But if I find them giving themselves
airs, or monopolising my father,
 or ill-treating him, or worrying him
with their artistic beastliness,
 I intend to put my foot down.
 Yes, and firmly.
 Taking my mother's place.
 She always meant to get her hands
on Howards End and now she's got it.
 15. I'll give you 10.
 10? I've got the money.
 No, they're worth twice as much.
I'll give you 12. Final offer?
 Yes, fine. All right.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 Go on, Len, do go on.
 You must write. You must!
 It's their doing, isn't it? They
told you to leave the Porphyrion.
 I don't know. But a man...
 Well, isn't it? All right!
 They only meant to be kind.
 Don't you snip at me, my boy.
I'm not...snipping. I...
 I'll write. I promise. Just...
 Go to bed.
 All right, darling. I'm sorry.
 It's all right.
 "Dear Miss Schlegel...
 "I wanted to thank you for your
consideration in forewarning me
 "of the expected collapse of the
Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company.
 "Taking your advice,
I have resigned from my position.
 "I have now taken a role as
a clerk at Dempster's bank.
 "Whilst my salary is
much lower than before,
 "and I find myself in
more reduced circumstances,
 "I can be thankful
that my position is now secure.
 "Yours gratefully, Leonard Bast."
 But how dreadful!
 Hello!
 Here we all are!
 Morning, Helen.
 Morning, Mr Wilcox.
 Henry, she's had a letter
from that queer, cross boy.
 Do you remember?
Very handsome but sad eyes.
 The back of his head was young.
 You told him
to clear out of the Porphyrion.
 I told him? Told who?
Of whom are you talking?
 I had a letter too - not a nice one.
I want to talk it over with you.
 Mr Bast. Our friend.
 You warned him about the Porphyrion.
Don't you remember? I do not.
 Yes. He cleared out,
thanks to your hint.
 It's not a bad business,
the Porphyrion.
 You say he's cleared out?
On what grounds?
 Not a bad business?
On the grounds of your advice to us.
 The Porphyrion?
No, I shouldn't have said so.
 No, my letter's about Howards End.
 My tenant, Mr Bryce, he's been
ordered abroad. But, surely
on Chelsea Embankment...
 He wants to sublet it.
 Morning, Mrs Munt.
But you did say...
 Good morning, good morning!
 Fine view. Morning, Schlegel.
Good morning. Isn't it?
 He has no right to do it.
There's no clause in the contract.
 Who, Henry? My tenant
at Howards End. I'm thinking of
cancelling the agreement.
 Do you think that's better than
subletting? Excuse me, I'm sorry.
 About the Porphyrion -
I don't feel easy.
 Might I bother you, Henry? Yes, yes?
 You said it was a bad concern, so
we advised this clerk to clear out.
 He writes this morning
that he's taken our advice,
 and now you say
it's not a bad concern.
 He's gone into a bank.
 It's a much lower salary,
but he hopes to manage -
 a branch of Dempster's Bank.
Is that all right?
 Oh, my goodness me, yes.
More right than the Porphyrion?
 Yes, yes, yes.
Safe as houses - safer.
 Oh, many thanks. I'm sorry...
If you sublet Howards End...?
 Well, you have more control.
 We ought to go and see the place
some time. It's pretty in its way.
 Why don't we motor down
next Wednesday
and have lunch with Charles?
 He and Dolly are only 15 minutes'
drive from Howards End now.
 Come up to town,
I'll show you the office
 and we can drive down together.
It'll be fun.
 Oh, I should love to.
 But Aunt Juley expects us
to stop at least another week.
 Well, you can give that up now.
 No, honestly. She counts on
this visit year after year.
 She turns the house
upside down for us.
 That's all right. I'll speak to her.
Henry, I won't go. Don't bully me.
 You do want to see the house,
though? Very much, but...
 That'll be all right, then.
 Oh, Mr Wilcox, about
the Porphyrion...
 It's all right!
Dempster's Bank is better.
 But I think you told us
 the Porphyrion would smash
before Easter.
 Did I? Ah...
 Well, it was still
outside the Tariff Ring.
 Lately it's come in -
safe as houses now.
 In other words,
Mr Bast need never have left it
 and started life elsewhere
at a greatly reduced salary.
 No, the fellow needn't.
 He only says "reduced."
 With a man so poor,
every reduction must be great.
 I consider it
a deplorable misfortune.
 Do you mean I'm responsible?
You're ridiculous, Helen.
 The point is... The point is,
 a man who had little money
has less, owing to us.
 Who is this fellow?
 We have told you
about the fellow twice.
 You have even met the fellow.
 He is very poor and his wife...
Helen, please! ..is a fool,
 and he is capable of better things.
No, Meg!
 We thought we would help him
from the height of our superior
knowledge - and here's the result!
 A word of advice...
 I require no more advice.
 A word of advice.
 Don't take up that sentimental
attitude over the poor.
 See that she doesn't, Margaret.
 You call it sentiment.
I call it common humanity.
 Indeed?
 Well, you talk about this young man
as if he were an exhibition
in the circus. I don't!
 As if there were not three millions
more like him in London alone,
 besides their wives and children.
 And must we not do our best to...
 Are we not to help them
if we can, when the chance comes?
 When our paths cross?
Of course we must!
 But you haven't helped him.
 No. I haven't. Oh, it's impossible.
Oh, don't let's row...
 My dear Helen, neither you, nor I
nor my informant, nor the directors
 of the Porphyrion are to blame
for this clerk's loss in salary.
 No-one is to blame.
 I am.
 You're too severe. You're guilty of
nothing more than meddling
 in the life of a young man about
whom you know practically nothing.
 But we do know him, Henry. This
young man of yours is guilty of...
 No! He is guilty of an error
in judgment, merely.
 Of quitting his situation
for a worse one
 without determining the wisdom
of his actions for himself.
 Do I misstate the case, Helen?
 Margaret?
 No.
 I don't know.
 My dears. What about going to
Nine Barrows Down for the day?
 Mrs Munt, I did want to talk to you
about some pressing business
 that calls Margaret and me
to Hilton next week.
 Oh, surely not!
 But they were going to stop for
the next ten days at the least.
 Yes, I know.
 The thing is, what I've done...
 CONVERSATION FADES OUT
 I can't think why
I go on like this myself.
 But Helen, why should you
put things so bitterly?
 Because I'm an old maid.
 Go on and marry him.
 I think you're splendid, and
if anyone can pull it off, you will.
 There's nothing to "pull off."
 Yes, there is.
 Go on and fight with him
and help him.
 Don't ask me for help,
or even for sympathy.
 Henceforward I am going my own way.
 I mean to dislike your husband,
and tell him so.
 But I mean to love you
more than ever.
 Yes, I do.
 SHE KISSES HER
 Margaret! Magsy!
 Surely, it can't be true
what Mr Wilcox is saying,
 that you want to go next week?
 Not "want."
 But there's so much to settle,
and I do want to see the Charleses.
 Oh, but you're going to miss out
on going to Weymouth
 and the Lulworth trip, and...
 Helen, have you heard?
 Good! I did the breaking of the ice.
 Margaret Schlegel to see
Mr Wilcox, please.
 One minute!
 Why, Charles. How do you do?
 I hope that my wife...
 How do you do?
 ..will give you a decent lunch
after you see Howards End.
 Miss Avery, from the farm,
is looking after it.
 Do sit down!
 It's a measly little place.
 I wouldn't touch it
with tongs myself.
 I shall enjoy seeing it.
 Hello! Hello. I won't be a moment.
 They're all right.
 The chickens? Or the children?
 They'll learn. Like the swallows
and the telegraph lines.
 There's a pretty church.
 No, you aren't sharp enough.
 THUNDER RUMBLES
 What's happened?
 What do you suppose?
 Are we there already?
 We are.
 Well, I never!
 That's no good. It's locked.
 Margaret,
why don't you wait in the dry?
 I'll go down to the farm
for the key. It isn't 100 yards.
 Mayn't I come too? No, no.
I'll be back before I'm gone.
 DOOR CLOSES
 CREAKING
 Is that you, Henry?
 Oh!
 Well, I took you for Ruth Wilcox!
 I? Mrs Wilcox?
 I?
 LAUGHTER
 But it did give her quite a turn.
 Did she? Yes, it did.
Old Miss Avery!
 I wasn't as foolish as you suggest.
 She only startled me, for
the house was silent for so long.
 But who is she?
 Oh, she's just
one of the crew from the farm.
 I say, if Crane has had enough tea,
we ought to go.
 Children, come and say goodbye!
 Come and give Miss Schlegel a kiss.
 Oh, no, don't make them.
 It's such hard luck
on the little things.
 What about Grand-papa?
Shall he have his kisses?
 What about Grand-papa?
 What about me? I don't mind!
They're fine little fellows!
 Little kiss?
 Thank you, Dolly.
 Bye-bye! Bye!
 Dolly is a good little woman,
but a little of her goes a long way.
 I suppose that rules out
Howards End.
 With Charles and Dolly
15 minutes' distance?
 I should think so!
 But Henry, if we can't live
at Howards End and you don't want
to live in Ducie Street,
 where do you propose we live?
 Oniton. Oniton?
 The house in Shropshire.
Oniton Grange. Rather good country.
 Evie's going to be married
there in April,
 and we can move in
straightaway after that.
 Of course, we shall keep the house
in Ducie Street as a pied-a-terre.
 Of course.
 TRAIN CHUGS PAST
 Jacky, what are you doing
out of bed? Are you mad?
 Is this the letter?
The letter to Miss What's-her-name?
 That was before.
 Those are drafts of my letter.
 "...reduced circumstances?"
Are you mad?
 I told the Miss Schlegels
everything I thought necessary.
 Have you written again to say you've
been discharged from Dempster's?
 I wasn't discharged.
Call it what you like, my boy.
 They reduced the staff. How are we
to live? I won't ask for charity!
 This isn't charity. All you want's
a job. I'll find a position.
 I'll write to them myself. You
won't. I'll write to your brother.
 You'll do nothing of the kind.
Just see if I don't.
 You won't!
 SHE COUGHS
 Jacky.
 Come to bed.
 You're ill.
 I shall write to Miss Schlegel.
 And to my brother,
and any one you like.
 I won't let you starve.
 Helen, are you sure you won't come?
 No, you must let me
beg off Evie Wilcox, Meg.
 I shall come to your wedding,
though. Never fear.
 Walk on.
 "Dear Miss Schlegel, whilst
I hesitate to write a second time,
 "I felt I should inform you that
 "my circumstances have
lately taken a turn.
 "My recent arrival at Dempster's
has lamentably coincided with
 "a need for the bank
to reduce staff, and
 "as one of the newer employees I now
find myself without a position.
 "I apologise for being so
forthright, but I wondered
 "if I might petition for some
further help in finding employment.
 "I am not one to beg for charity,
 "but I find myself struggling
to provide for my wife
 "and I am unsure how to proceed.
 "Yours truly, Leonard Bast."
 Miss Schlegel! Hello, Len.
 Please forgive me, Mr Bast.
But I won't stand for it.
 I must insist that...
 Charles!
 No, please.
 Oh, thank you, Charles.
I could have easily managed.
 Well, we made good time,
at any rate.
 Why, Mr Warrington!
Albert! How good of you to come!
 Miss Schlegel!
 Well, we are to be sisters soon!
Yes, let me kiss you!
 It's so beautiful!
The house? Oh, I don't know.
 The view is rather nice, though.
That's what I meant.
 What a pity that your brother
and sister couldn't come.
 Mr Fussel! What do you think?
 You must be choked with dust
from the drive.
 I'll have someone show you
to your room.
 I quite enjoyed the drive.
There wasn't any dust.
 Burton. Will you take
Miss Schlegel to her room?
 She wants to clean up.
Very good, sir.
 Margaret! Well, well, well!
 Henry, what a beautiful place!
 Ah, yes?
 Ah, I'm glad you like it,
I'm glad you like it.
 It's not the right part
of Shropshire,
 so I've discovered,
but I'll admit it's a fine prospect.
 Now then, Margaret,
will you come inside?
 Burton, Miss Schlegel
will want to clean up.
 If you'll accompany me, Miss.
 No, I'd rather walk about the
grounds a bit. Will you come, Henry?
 Not just now. And I should like you
to help greet our guests.
 Of course, Henry.
 Mr Burton, may you show me my room?
I should like to clean up a bit.
 Certainly, Miss.
 Now then, my boy!
 Your little sister married.
What do you think?
 I? I think he's too old for her.
But it's not my wedding.
 Oh! What's this? Sulks?
 No, of course not.
 My goodness!
What a muscle! What a muscle!
 Duncan! Come and feel
this boy's arm! Like steel!
 Billy Hague, this chap! Billy Hague!
 Well, I'm altogether off Dad.
 Marrying that woman!
 I never dreamed of such a thing.
 He made me ask her to Simpson's.
What could I do?
 Don't talk nonsense.
You'll be all right.
 I've two children to look after,
and another coming.
 It's all very well, the pater
saying he'll be just to all of us.
 But one can't be just indefinitely.
 Money isn't elastic.
 What's to happen
if you have a family?
 Come to that, so may the pater.
 I expect we shall
be in for some shares,
 but it's a sad lookout for me
if my own father doesn't trust me
 to manage the company
I've worked for my entire life...
 This is very jolly, I must say,
the day before my wedding!
 I'm sorry, old pal.
 It's all right, old pal.
 I love this place, Henry.
 I'm glad that it will be my home.
 Ah, dear,
what a comfort to have arrived!
 MEN SHOUT: Come on!
 SPLASHING
 APPLAUSE
 This is a mistake.
 Mr Bast. You promised me...
 I had no right promising.
 It is humiliating beyond what any
man should be obliged to submit to.
 Why? You've done nothing wrong.
 She's no business taking
a trip like this. Even if...
 I'm not ill.
I could do with a bite.
 We can put that right easily enough.
 No. I cannot allow you to
pay for another meal.
 The train tickets alone...
 I'm sorry. But if Mrs Bast is
hungry or unwell, it's my fault.
 Mine and Mr Wilcox's.
 He must be made to see reason,
or justice, or both.
 Please don't stand in my way.
 Mr Wilcox?
Is that your gentleman's name?
 He's not my gentleman. But, yes.
 Henry Wilcox of the Imperial and
West African what-do-you-call-it.
 I don't suppose you know him?
 Not I.
 Miss Schlegel, I must insist on
turning round at the next station.
 No, Len. Mr Bast... I shall repay
you for the tickets as soon
 as I am able, but I cannot...
Oh, let it alone, Len! Please do!
 CROWD CHATS
 INDISTINCT CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER
 Well, Cahill. You're a Wilcox, now.
What do you say?
 But he's not a Wilcox, Dad.
I'm a Cahill.
 I was rather hoping
to be a Wilcox.
 Well, you are, so you are!
 Cheers.
 I must say I'm very pleased.
 Do you know, I'm quite tired.
 I think it did go off very well.
 I am so very glad about that,
Henry, dear.
 Who are those people?
 Callers? It's too late for callers.
 Well, hide here,
and if I can, I'll stop them.
 Helen! What is it?
 Wait here.
 Oh, what's wrong? Is Tibby ill?
 They're starving!
I found them starving!
 Oh, Helen! What have you done now?
 He's been turned out of his bank.
We've ruined him.
 His wife is ill. Starving.
She fainted on the train.
 Helen, are you mad?
 Perhaps. Yes. If you like.
 I'm mad. But I've brought them.
 Don't be absurd. They are not
starving and you know it.
 I won't take such theatrical
nonsense. How dare you!
 Yes, how dare you!
 Bursting into Evie's wedding
in this heartless way!
 I want to see Mr Wilcox.
 How do you do, Mr Bast?
 This is an odd business.
What view do you take of it?
 There is Mrs Bast, too.
 How do you do, Miss Schlegel?
 I'm afraid we're making a dreadful
nuisance of ourselves.
 Miss Schlegel...
 Dempster's Bank reduced their staff
and now he's penniless.
 I consider that we and our informant
are directly to blame.
 We want Mr Wilcox to get him
back into the Porphyrion.
 Excuse me. I told your sister...
 I hate all this. I only thought...
 I hope you do, Mr Bast.
It's no good mincing matters.
 If you intend to confront Mr Wilcox
 and to call him to account
for a chance remark,
 you will make a great mistake.
 I intend no such thing,
I promise you.
 I made them come! I did it!
Kindly lower your voice.
 I can only advise you to go at once.
 My sister has put you
in a false position,
 and it is kindest to tell you so.
 You'll find a comfortable hotel
in the village,
 where Mrs Bast may rest, and
I hope you'll be my guests there.
 It's work he wants.
Not a holiday in Oniton.
 He can't get back now,
thanks to you.
 I want... Do be quiet.
 It's all right, Miss Schlegel.
 I was wrong to write you.
Wrong to ask for your assistance.
 You were not.
 Please, please, won't you go to the
hotel and have a good night's rest
 and some day you may
pay me back, if you prefer.
 I don't know what to do.
This isn't my house.
 Helen, offer them something.
Do try a sandwich, Mrs Bast.
 Helen, take them quietly
to the George in Oniton,
 and I will talk to Henry -
in my own way.
 If you don't, I will do nothing.
Now choose.
 Was it townies?
 You'll never believe me.
 It's all right now,
but it was my sister.
 I've bundled her off to the George.
Helen - here?
 But she refused an invitation.
I thought she despised weddings!
 She's not come to the wedding.
 Well, she must stay here, there's
plenty of room. We can't have her
going off... It's all right.
 She brought two of her proteges
with her. She must keep with them.
 Let 'em all come.
They want to speak to me.
 Later on I want to talk to you
about them. Why not now?
 No time like the present.
 There's a sting at the end of it,
 for I want you to find
the man some work.
 What are his qualifications?
 You've met him before, in fact.
He's in a bit of trouble.
 Oh, no thank you, dearie.
 Just one glass, Miss.
To toast the happy couple?
 The happy couple? All right.
 That's quite nice, actually.
That's right, Miss.
 Where was he before?
 Dempster's Bank.
They reduced their staff.
 All right. I'll see him.
 Mind you, Margaret, this mustn't be
taken as a precedent.
 I can't fit in
your proteges every day.
 I promise this is the last.
He's rather a special case.
 Proteges always are.
 Oh, Henry, I'm so sorry.
 Helen was to take them
both to a hotel in the village.
 I'm afraid she's overtired.
 She's something else. This won't do.
I can't have her in my garden.
 Madam, you'll be more comfortable
at the hotel...
 Why, it's Henry!
 Bless us, what a person!
 Oh, Hen. I'm sorry. I'm...
 I didn't know.
 I should've stayed at home. I'm so
sorry, Hen. Truly, I am. I didn't...
 I can't congratulate you
enough on your protege.
 Henry, I am awfully sorry.
Pray, don't apologise.
 Don't be angry, Hen. I'll go.
 Why does she call you Henry?
Has she ever seen you before?
 Seen him before? Seen Henry?
 Oh, these boys, and
still, we love 'em.
 Are you now satisfied?
 I don't know what it is all about.
 Let's come in.
 I now understand
your interest in the Basts.
 I don't understand!
 You do not? I do. I am a man.
I have lived a man's past.
 I have the honour now to
release you from your engagement.
 Henry...!
 Henry!
 Yes, Margaret?
 So that woman has been
your mistress?
 You put it with your usual delicacy.
 When, please?
 Ten years ago.
 Ten years...?
 Please excuse me.
 I'm so sorry, Len.
 Sorry for what?
 Was that the man?
 The man you knew in Cyprus?
 I never would have come.
As God is my judge, Len.
 We neither of us should have come.
 I suppose I was desperate.
 We had to, Len.
 I'm no use to you.
 That's all right.
 You're a good 'un, my Len.
You're a kind boy.
 You love me, don't you, darling?
 Yes, I love you.
 It's all right, Jacky.
 Go to sleep.
 I make it Â£8 I have spent making
your wife ill and my sister angry.
 She may disapprove my methods,
 but I know you and Mrs Bast
will benefit by them.
 I can never thank you sufficiently,
Miss Schlegel.
 Â£8 is a lot of money.
 I don't know when I can repay you,
but I promise...
 It is a lot of money to you.
 It is nothing to me.
Nothing. Can you imagine that?
 No.
 Is she very tired? Mrs Bast?
 Shall I sit up with her?
 No, thank you. She does not need
company. She's sleeping now.
 It is better
if she stops in her room.
 Mr Bast...
 What kind of woman is your wife?
 You know my ways by now.
Does that question offend you?
 No.
 I don't want to buy your confidence
with influence.
 Or Â£8 on railway tickets
and rooms in a hotel.
 Of course not.
 But, what I mean is...
 you don't pretend your marriage
has been a happy one.
 I suppose that's pretty obvious.
 But she's a good sort.
 But you and she
can have nothing in common.
 We have companionship in common.
 I needn't have married her.
 But as I have,
I must stick to her and keep her.
 What did your people say?
 They will not have anything
to do with us.
 They had a sort of family council
when they heard I was married,
 and cut us off altogether.
 Who are your people?
 My parents were in trade.
 I have two sisters, both married
to commercial travellers.
 And my brother is a lay reader.
 He is head of the family now.
 And your grandparents?
 They were just nothing at all.
 Agricultural labourers and that
sort, from Lincolnshire, mostly.
 And why...why do your brothers
and sisters object to Mrs Bast?
 I knew there was a man.
 I didn't know his name until today.
 I am frightfully, dreadfully sorry.
 But it does not make
the least difference to me.
 I blame not your wife
for these things, but men.
 We shall be all right if I get work.
 Then things won't be so bad again.
 I don't trouble after books
as I used.
 If I could just get
something regular to do,
 we should settle down again.
 It stops one thinking.
 Settle down to what?
 Oh, just settle down.
 And that's to be life?
 What else?
 But... And I am not naive,
 but with all the beautiful things
to see and do. With music.
 With walking at night. With...
 Oh, I did talk
a lot of nonsense once.
 Why should you say so?
 Because I see one must have money.
 Well, you're wrong.
 I wish I was wrong, but...
 The clergyman - he has money
of his own, or else he's paid.
 The poet or the musician -
just the same.
 The tramp goes to
the workhouse in the end,
 and is paid for
by other people's money.
 The rest is a dream.
 You're still wrong.
 If you say I am, then I am.
 We are all in a mist.
 But men like the Wilcoxes
are deeper in the mist than any.
 Sane, sound Englishmen!
 Building up empires,
 levelling all the world into
what they call common sense.
 It isn't real.
Upon my life, it isn't real.
 I must be stupid.
 Oh, dear...
 "My dearest boy..."
 You and your sister,
women like you -
 how can you guess at the temptations
that lie around a man?
 "Mr Bast, I have spoken to
Mr Wilcox, and am sorry to say
 "he has no vacancy for you."
 I am placing Â£5,000 to your account
and when I am in Germany
 you will pay it over
to Leonard and Mrs Bast.
 Where's Helen?
 It's been ever so long.
I'm dreadfully worried.
 I don't know what to think, Tibby.
 If you want my help, you have it.
 Margaret!
 Is it what we feared? Yes.
 If a man played about with my sister
I'd send a bullet through him.
 Oh, my darling, forgive me!
