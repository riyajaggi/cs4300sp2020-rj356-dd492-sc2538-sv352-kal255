 Excuse me. The sole special employment by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade was given to the Minister's son. Despite explanation from the Ministry, there is strong criticism that special advantages were given based on nepotism again. Even government positions, which should be given fairly, are used in backroom deals by the powerful, and young people without anyone who has their backs... There she goes again. A reporter shouldn't say someone "has their backs."

 {\an8}Based on what I've seen and experienced, {\an8}Korea doesn't seem to be very fair or just. {\an8}I'm Han Jae-hui with HBS News. Kang Ma-ru. Get moving. Kim Hyeong-cheol, 79. He was admitted for hypertension. There's paralysis in his left arm and leg. He seems to have a UTI. {\an8}We plan to do a renal function test and urine analysis. {\an8}The test isn't painful, so there's no need to worry. And nothing unusual was found. Yes, sir. Dr. Seok! Why don't you ask us any questions?

 Do you even know we're standing behind you? {\an8}This is the last day of our PK in Surgery. {\an8}Other doctors ask questions and make us do case reports. Why don't you ask us anything? Are you a doctor? Not yet. I'm sure you feel like one since you're wearing a gown and carrying medical books. It must feel good when people call you "doctor." You're probably hoping the rounds will end quickly and I don't ask you any difficult questions. But what? What questions? If I asked you, would you even understand? Are you saying you won't even give us a chance? Why should I waste time on hearing useless answers? But... I want to go home! - What's going on? - Let me go home! He removed his IV and wants to leave-- - Do you have his chart? - Let me go! Let me go home! Lee Chan-yeong. He's 11. He collapsed at home last night and had a seizure. - What was the diagnosis? - No abnormalities in the CT or MRI. And his family? He has an older brother. He's on his way here. His guardian said he was usually introverted and quiet. The PK who complained that I didn't ask questions. Yes? What do you think his illness is? - Pardon? - You wanted a question. You have two hours. Any objections? But... {\an8}He doesn't have any history of head trauma. {\an8}He doesn't have any infections, but he had a seizure. I'm in trouble. Hey! Why are you so drastic? I'm not sick at all. Discharge me. Just sit still. A person who isn't sick doesn't just collapse. My brother doesn't have any money! - Discharge me! - Be quiet! You're not the only one here. So let me go home! - It's not like you'll pay my medical bill! - Fine, I will pay for it! I'll pay your hospital bill. Are you happy now? Don't lie. You little runt. Were you lied to all your life? Stop faking it. People will think that I hit you. Chan-yeong, are you all right? Chan-yeong! Hey! What's wrong? Nurse! Jerk. Why did you hit my head? I think Lee Chan-yeong has a cerebral aneurysm. - Based on what? - He had acute laryngitis. His head started to hurt after he started to cough. I think his BP spiked from the excessive coughing, and the cerebral aneurysm burst. He didn't show any signs of headaches or vomiting. He probably said he was okay because he didn't want his brother to worry. He had a severe migraine yesterday, {\an8}and a thunderclap headache just now. {\an8}As you can see, {\an8}he just vomited, too. KANG MA-RU He's in that much pain, but didn't say anything because of his brother? He's only 11 years old. My sister is like that, too. She hides it when she's sick because she doesn't want me to worry. He probably had a cerebral aneurysm, but didn't have to go to the hospital. If it is an aneurysm, how do you explain the clear CT and MRI results? The hemorrhaging could have been minute. He seems very unstable and irritable. I read about patients who concealed extreme fear or couldn't control anger properly. Wouldn't it be more probable that he is addicted to drugs? He isn't the type of boy who would be addicted to drugs. You never had any intention of hearing my opinions. That's why you raise - unreasonable questions. - Hey! This is Seok Min-hyeok. {\an8}Is Lee Chan-yeong's angiogram back? {\an8}They just got the result. He doesn't have a cerebral aneurysm. If you don't believe it, go and see for yourself. No, sir. I must have been wrong. If he doesn't show any other symptoms, discharge him. Yes, doctor. AMBULANCE He was discharged this morning. There should be his record. Okay. SEOK MIN-HYEOK What is it? {\an8}Lee Chan-yeong is back in the ER with vomiting and stupor. {\an8}Another test showed subarachnoid hemorrhaging due to a cerebral aneurysm. There was some blood in his cerebrospinal fluid, too. {\an8}Give him a Mannitol IV {\an8}with an anti-nauseant and anti-convulsant. - Yes. - Oh. Where is that fellow? Pardon? Who? The PK who diagnosed the cerebral aneurysm. Do you mean Kang Ma-ru? He should be at the library or at home. Contact him. What do you want with him? I should tell him I was wrong and he was right. And that I'm embarrassed as his teacher. His name is Kang Ma-ru? I think our medical school will have a genius doctor in two years. Choco, I'm home. Hey, chocolate lover, I bought you some chocolate. Is she sleeping? Choco, did you eat before going to sleep? Choco. Choco. Choco! Choco! Choco! Choco, open your eyes. Choco. Choco, wake up. How long have you been like this? You should have told me if you were sick. This won't do. Let's go to the hospital. Get up. Lean back. Let's get some socks on you. I have to get you to the hospital. You idiot. You dummy. You pathetic fool. I'm all right. I'm all right. No, you're not! You're burning up! I'm going to give you a good beating when we get back. JAE-HUI Hi, Jae-hui. Choco is sick. - I'll call you later. - Help me. Help me, Ma-ru. What's wrong? I think he's dead. No. No, he isn't dead. Come and save him. Please save him. What's going on? What are you talking about? You must have learned how to save a person's life! I'm sure they taught you in school! Jae-hui... I'm scared. I'm scared, Ma-ru. Where are you? I'll come right over. Where are you? Okay. Don't go. I'm sick. Don't go, Ma-ru. Something happened to Jae-hui. I have to go over there. We'll go to the hospital when I get back. Wait a little while. I'm not all right. I'm sick. I'm really, very sick. Don't go, Ma-ru. Just count to 500, okay? I'll be back before you reach 500. I promise. I'm going to die. If you go to Jae-hui, I'm going to just die. I'll be right back. Just count to 500, okay? Got it? Is he dead? I don't know. Is he dead? Why? Why did he die? I didn't kill him. Why did he die? Why are you looking at me like that? I said I didn't kill him. I didn't kill him. I didn't kill him, you bastard! I didn't kill him. Did you hit him with this? He... tried to hurt you, right? - You had no choice. - Yes. Turn yourself in. It was self-defense. It was an accident. They'll take that into consideration if you turn yourself in. You may even just get probation. Turn yourself in. It will all be over then. - Jae-hui. - Self-defense, probation, they're all meaningless. If people find out, it will be the end of my career as a reporter. You don't have to be a reporter. You can do something else. You can start over. You want me to go back to the sewer again? After all I did to get here? After all I did to get out of there? You want me to go back to that hell? Just tell me to die. I'd rather die! Jae-hui. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Let go of me! I have no reason to live. There's no reason for me to live! Stop it. The only thing that kept me alive for the past 15 years was my dream of becoming an anchorwoman. It's all over now. Let go of me! Drop that! What's wrong? You're so mean. Let me see. Are you hurt? Can't I be a reason? For 13 years, I only followed the light that Han Jae-hui shined in that endless sewer. Am I not good enough to be a reason for you to live? {\an8}MOTEL Do you think there is a God? Why is He like this only to me? Why is He cruel only to me? What did I ever do? If He was going to be cruel, he should've been from the start. He should have just crushed me so that I couldn't dream, lift my head, or have any other thoughts. He let me think I could change my destiny with hard work. Why did He give me hope and make me have pointless dreams? You must not be His type. A perfect woman like you who is smart, sexy, and pretty may have annoyed Him. I'm hungry. I should ask the police to order me some seolleongtang. Is this the police? I'd like to... turn myself... Ma-ru. What are you doing? What are you doing? Ma-ru. Ma-ru. What are you... I killed him. - Ma-ru. - I killed him. You don't know anything about this. Don't. Don't do this! Leave. Get out of here! Don't look back. Just... look forward. No. Why would you do that? Why would you do that? I don't have to be a doctor, but you can't live if you give up on your dream. You'll get sick and wither away and die. Get out of here now. I didn't eat anything all day either. I want to go to the police station and eat. Go. Mr. Choi, are you heading over to see the chairman? I'm on my way home now anyway. Let's go in my car. It's a bit messy, but I'd like to talk to you about something. We're going to the same place. We shouldn't waste gas by taking two cars, even if the company is paying. It's an honor for me to be in a car driven by you, miss. Why don't you hire a driver? Why do you still drive yourself? I have a shitty temper, so no one ever lasts. Three drivers quit this month alone. You know that. Why... do you keep calling me "miss"? Is it to test me? Or is it because you want to put me in my place? - Pardon? - I'm sure you're pissed off as hell that the young daughter of the chairman became your superior thanks to her daddy. What? No. Not at all, miss... No, Ms. Seo. Why would you say that? "So what if she got an MBA from Harvard? What would a 23-year-old girl know about running a company? Does she think running a company is a game?" I hear that's what you say behind my back. That's not true. Someone's framing me. I don't hold grudges. I'm cool like that, so don't wet yourself. What I'm about to say should scare you though. If you're taking any heart medication, this would be a good time to take one. The acquisition of Gray Department Store. Its total assets are worth 259.2 billion won, and it has liabilities of 157.1 billion won. Thus, it has a net value of 102.1 billion won. How could you acquire a company like that for 144.3 billion won? Even when you say we paid a premium for its potential, it's still more than 10% above of the appropriate amount. About 95.2 billion won for Pine Department Store last year and 36.8 billion won for the Potex Mall two years ago. They were all acquired for 10 to 20% more than their market value. I know you're not that big a moron. Did you collude with the consulting firm and take a kickback? How can you suggest that? I'm hurt. You'll piss me off if you say that. That idiot. Hey, punk! Are you blind? Drive properly! Jerks like that should be shoved down the garbage disposal. I'm sorry. Where was I? Tell me what you want. Should I report you and have you locked up? Or do you want to give back 97% of your severance and walk out on your own? You can keep the remaining 3%. Do you know... what I did? Do you know what I did to protect you, Mr. Chairman? Do you know what I just did to the man I cherish more than life itself? I'm sorry, Mr. Choi. Where were we? I won't forget this. I will repay you for the rest of my life. I swear. Choco, it's me. Are you all right? I'm sorry, but I can't come home. I called Jae-gil. He'll take you to the hospital. I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise. Kang Ma-ru is sentenced to five years in prison. {\an8}6 YEARS LATER {\an8}AOMORI, JAPAN Let's have dinner at the hotel sky lounge. This hotel's kaiseki is famous. Let's stop. This is all I have. CASHIER'S CHECK 10 MILLION WON What is this? Can't you count? Did you think I was a hooker? Were you treating me like a whore all this time? No. I thought you were a temptress. An infamous temptress in your community for taking even the clothes off the guy's back. You chose the wrong person this time. I don't have as much money as you hoped. How long did you know? Is that important? Why didn't you say anything if you knew? It didn't matter. I didn't care whether or not you were a temptress. It wasn't like that! It wasn't like that with you. I really love you. You're right. At first, I approached you thinking you had money, with the intention of extorting you. But you were different from other guys. I can't blame you if you don't believe me, but I really liked you. I loved you. I mean it. I'm sure you don't believe me. I wouldn't either. It's natural you don't believe me. I believe you. Babe. I believe you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ms. Seo. What time is it? It's a little after 8:30 a.m. - Do you feel okay? - It's 8:30 a.m.? Didn't you say Chairman Kato was taking a 9:00 a.m. flight? He already left for the airport. Why didn't you wake me? Why didn't that bastard Mr. Jang wake me up? I told him not to. What? You slept less than seven hours this week. Work is good and all, but think about your condition. This could kill you-- You constantly overestimate your authority. Can't you distinguish what you have the authority to decide and what you don't? I'm sorry, but I have no choice. Dr. Kim warned you several times about your health. I think you should be more concerned about keeping your job. If this deal falls through, the first thing I'll do is fire you. What happened with the complaint about the face cream? Other hotels in Japan would like to return the amenity products that we had delivered. Damn it. Ms. Seo. Other than the product that the woman used, none of the other products had heavy metals, right? That's correct. Contact her right now. - Pardon? Who? - The customer who claims she broke out due to our cream. Let's apologize first. Yes, Ms. Seo. Get me a copy of the transactions of that customer's and her family's bank accounts. Use all means necessary. Sure. You like men, right? You didn't change your sexual preference to women, did you? No. I'll take that secret to my grave. Don't worry, sweetie. I understand you were inconvenienced. Let me apologize on behalf of the company. Do you think an apology would suffice? You want to compensate me with this petty cash? If there is something else that you want, please let me know. I'm hungry. Let's eat. Thank you. Is that kimchi? Yes. Does it displease you? Should I put it away? There's no need to do that. I've always wanted to try Korean kimchi. It's delicious. Thank you for the meal. I have another engagement, so please excuse me. Okay. Also, please take this. Isn't this the face cream - that I complained about? - That's right. It also has the same ingredients as the yogurt you just ate. Did you feed me ingredients of a face cream? Don't worry. Our skin products are edible. They're made with organic ingredients. If there were heavy metals in our cosmetics as you claim, I guess I'll see you in the hospital tomorrow. I have extremely sensitive skin, too. What are you saying? Speak in Japanese. I know you understand Korean. You ate that aged kimchi really well. Japanese people eat kimchi well. - Just because I ate kimchi-- - See? You understood everything. Hey, Korean lady with the slightly awkward Japanese accent. Stop messing around. This is your bank account, right? The 3,000,000 yen deposited into that account was from Mr. Ha of OL Group, our competitor. You did that to your face for that chump change? Turn her over to the police and call the newspapers. Give them our official position on this matter. Prepare to take revenge on OL Group. Make it good. Are you all right? Of course. Did you soak in the hot springs? Isn't the water here really nice? You don't look too well. I'm trying to look like I worked really hard. Where's Dad? Is he still in his room? He left with Mr. Jang an hour ago. He had to attend a luncheon at the Blue House. He told me to wait and come back with you. Does that mean everyone from the company left? You have a fever. Let's get you to the hospital. You can drop the act now. The audience is gone. Eun-gi. Let's say I won today. I think my acting was a bit better than yours. Mommy. Mommy. I told you to wait. Why did you come? I was bored. Sis. Do you want to play the monster game with me? It must be hereditary. Being clueless and tactless, and throwing himself onto anyone as necessary. You're not anyone. You're his sister. - He just likes his sister. - I'm not his sister. I don't consider you my brother. I must have told you that over 100 times already. You still don't get it? Are you a moron? Mommy. What's wrong with you? - Eun-seok is only four. - He may only be four, but he's your son. At age 28, you became the mistress of a man old enough to be your father. Eventually, you kicked out his devoted wife. You're the legendary Han Jae-hui, and he's your son. That's why he scares me, too. Who knows when he'll bare his teeth and bite my neck? That's why he scares me. Stop crying. She's just kidding. Stop crying, Eun-seok. It's all right. Stop crying. Stop crying. Are you going to keep crying? I wasn't crying. I really wasn't crying. I have dry eyes, so I was just rubbing them, that's all. Hey. I might be a doofus, but I wouldn't cry over a temptress who lied to me, stabbed me in the back, and took all my money. Do you think I'm not over her or something? Do you think I still have feelings for that reptile? You think I'm an idiot? Yes. Woah. You succeeded already? You only made a move a week ago. Take out the money that she scammed you out of, and put the rest in Choco's account. One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand... That's 135,830,000... She gave you her whole account? She let someone like you trick her? Was she that stupid? Let's go back to Seoul. We're done here. Did you... kiss her? Did you kiss her? What do you think? You did. I'm sure you did. I know you. Did you sleep with her? You did. I'm sure you did! Of course, you did. I know you. How... How many times did you sleep with her? Two? Three? - Four? - Multiply that by four and add ten. You evil jerk! I told you to get my money back, not sleep with her. You're such a snake! You're disgusting! HE'S A PERVERT, PLAYER, AND HAS NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN I'M A PUREHEARTED CUTE GUY WITHOUT A GIRLFRIEND Hello. What? I wasn't trying to give that to you. MY BOYFRIEND IS A GANGSTER! So... Do you want it? It's the newest phone. I bought it less than a week ago. It gets crazy good reception. Yes, this is nice, but this is a public place and we're on a plane. Oh no. Ms. Seo! Ms. Seo! Ms. Seo. Ms. Seo. Wake up. Oh, no. Ms. Seo. Ms. Seo, wake up. Ms. Seo. What should we do? What is it? Huh? Ladies and gentlemen, there is a very ill patient on board. - If there is a doctor among you, - Is there a doctor? please alert a flight attendant or come to the business class cabin. There aren't any doctors? Oh, no. - Her pulse is continuing to slow down. - Nothing can happen to her. That's unacceptable. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a very ill patient on board. If there is a doctor among you, please alert a flight attendant or come to the business class cabin. You are a doctor. You're a doctor. I was kicked out of school my junior year. They're repeating the announcement. There must not be any doctors. You should go and see. At least you have some experience. Do you have nothing better to do? Read this. There are a lot of pretty women. A person is sick. Can you connect me to the chairman? There isn't a single doctor on the plane? Do you have a death wish? Choco could have died. She collapses all the time. If everyone just ignored her and passed by, if nobody took her to the hospital, she'd already be dead. You should pay it forward. Be a decent human being. Selfish bastard. Self-centered jerk. You don't care about anyone else. Mean bastard. You don't have an ounce of sympathy. Is that right? Is it "a drop"? An iota? No. A pound? Are you going? It must be better than having you spit all over me. Dirty jerk. I knew it. Mentioning Choco always works. May I take a look? Is it serious? It seems like it. Doesn't she have a guardian? Where is her guardian? She went to call the chairman. Madam. Her guardian is here. He's a doctor. I'm not a doctor. I attended a medical college, but I was expelled. If you don't trust me, I'll leave. No. That's not it. What is your relationship to her? You don't trust me because I'm not a doctor? Should I just let her die? She's my daughter. My daughter. She's my daughter. I'm not her real mom. She's my husband's daughter. Mommy. Eun-seok, your sister is sick, so sit here quietly, okay? Good boy. Her blood pressure is dropping. Sir. How long until we land? We made an emergency request. It will take at least 30 minutes to the closest airport. There is a lot of air and water in her lungs. If pressure is applied to her heart, - she may die sooner. - What are you saying? Are you saying she could die? I'm saying we don't have a lot of time to wait. All I can do is remove the air and buy some time. What's going on? What's wrong? Did something go wrong? Was she ever in a car accident? Something's wrong, right? - Was she in a car accident? - I asked you if something is wrong! Did she ever break her ribs or anything in an accident? I thought you were her mom. Stop it. Just stop. If anything happens to her... If she dies... Stop, Ma-ru! You're not even a doctor. Stop! I heard that quack and Jae-hui seemed to know each other. So, did you meet that man who isn't a doctor, but is just as good? I'm sure there was a reason why you had to say you killed him. You know my nickname is "Crazy Dog," right? Stop annoying me and pissing me off. After all I did to save your life? I can't kill you that easily. Han Jae-hui pressed charges against you for blackmail.
