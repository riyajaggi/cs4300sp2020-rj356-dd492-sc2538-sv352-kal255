 Stop, Ma-ru! You're not even a doctor. Stop! He threatened my family. He extorted a billion won from me. Thank you. That's what I should say, right? I'm leaving. Let's meet again, you and I. I'm suddenly curious about you. Let's meet again,

 you and I. Tomorrow and the day after. Is that a yes or a no? What time should we meet tomorrow? As soon as we wake up? Where will you be when you wake up? What are you thinking about? Your wedding's coming up. Maybe I should've just let you fall on your face and break your nose. Then you'd call off the wedding. What a shame. I missed a good opportunity. I didn't live life as long as you did, but this is the way life works. If everything seems too easy

 and is going your way, a problem will eventually appear somewhere along the way and take you down. Especially if there are impure intentions. Without fail. You're halfway to your destination. I'm just saying you shouldn't relax too much just because the road appears nicely paved. Do you think I, the warrior for justice, will just sit around and watch? What's going on between you and him? How did you meet that man who brought you home last night? Do you even know who he is? Where is this sudden interest in my personal life coming from? Are you trying to act like my mother? It's contemptible. How far did you go with him? You saw us. I'm the one hitting on him. Who knows what he's like? Do you know him well? How much do you know about him? You don't know anything. You know nothing! And you do? Do you know him well? How well do you know him for you to get so excited with such conviction? Hold on. You're not interested in him as a man, are you? He's young and unnervingly good looking. He didn't seem like a good person. Is that so? He knows who you are, doesn't he? He approached you on purpose, knowing what family you belong to. I know people like him. "People like him"? Oh. For example, people like you? Stop being so cynical. Then let me be serious. Even if he approached me on purpose because of my wealth, it doesn't matter. I put up with you. What would I have to fear? I'm going to go. You'll be the one who's hurt. You'll be the one who cries, you fool. Ma-ru. Come in. What? I'm sorry. For what? You got beat up and hurt because I went to my mom. Why am I nothing but a nuisance to you? That's true. Am I really just a nuisance to you? You said you were. You're supposed to be my brother. I'm not just a nuisance. I do your laundry sometimes. I cook for you sometimes. I even clean your room sometimes. I think I'm the one who does most of that. That's why I said, "sometimes." When that mad dog almost killed you in high school, I saved you by throwing it a sausage. Did you? Are you senile? There has to be more. When you were in college, when that stalker girl found out you were dating Jae-hui tried to jump into the river with you, saying she'll die with you, I gave her my Shinhwa concert tickets and barely stopped her. Yeah. I remember that. If I had to tell you everything that I did for you, we'll be here until you get married and your son goes to kindergarten. Okay, thanks. You saved me. I have to go. EG ENTERTAINMENT TALENT SEARCH Pick me. Please pick me. Thank you. Number 96. Yes. Hello. I'm Kang Choco from Jeongneung. Please begin. How is the sky so blue? I'm sorry. Let me start over. My voice doesn't come out when I'm nervous. How is the sky so blue? Please... let me try it one more time. The other people are waiting. We saw enough. Hey kid, do you want to hear me sing? I can't sing in front of an audience. But I'm one in a million. I'm the Mariah Carey of the East. The judges were too impatient. They'd die if they heard me sing. -Do you want to hear me sing? -Yes. My tears I'm number 96. Kang Choco from Jeongneung. Pretending not to know See? I'm so good when I sing for you, right? No. I'm not a crazy person. CHOCO & MA-RU Excuse me, ma'am. What is it? May I ask you a question? Sure, go ahead. How long have you lived here? For over 20 years. Why do you ask? Good. By any chance, have you seen this person before? I'm not sure. Take a good look. Didn't she live in this neighborhood? I did take a good look. I don't know her at all. She never lived here. Is that so? It's as you suspected. Mr. Park is investigating himself. I don't think it's because he suspects me. I don't think he can shake his suspicions regarding Kang Ma-ru and feels the need to do something. I gave him fake past addresses for Madam Han. I made sure the neighbors don't say anything. I paid them enough, so you don't have to worry. Because you've loved me... for a very long time, way before the chairman did. May I join you? That elevator is full. I'm sorry, but this elevator is only for executives. -Please take another elevator. -Just let me take this one. It's huge and it's empty. Are you an executive? I am. I heard that at Taesan Group, all of its employees was the owner. Was that a lie? Like hell, the employees are the owner. Even the elevator discriminates. Excuse me? I'm Han Jae-hui, a reporter for HBS. I'm here to interview the chairman. This incident right here shows the hypocrisy and duplicity of the group. I can expose the truth, right? What did you say your name was? Han Jae-hui. A reporter with HBS. Han Jae-hui. The chairman is here. Eun-gi and Jae-hui should be at the hotel. They went to work out early. I see. Min-yeong. Yes, sir. Go ahead. It's about Jae-hui. What do you think of her? What do you mean? Do you think she's someone I can trust? I'm not sure why you're asking. I don't trust women. I never trusted anyone more than 30 percent. Jae-hui is different, right? She... wouldn't betray me, right? How could someone like me dare judge her? All I know is that she has been more sincere toward you and more devoted to you than anyone else before. I don't think you have anything to worry about. Eun-gi. Wait up. Did you sleep well? You really came. We said we'd meet as soon as we woke up. I'm just happy to see you. Did you wait long? No. Only about two hours. We saw each other by the gate last night, didn't we? She's going to marry my father soon. I saw you on TV before. I remember you being a passionate reporter who criticized the injustices of society and said we shouldn't compromise when it came to ethics. Is that true? That was you, right? Han Jae-hui. Wow. You're impressive. You remember the name of a reporter who was on the news for a brief moment? I was a huge fan of hers. You must be happy to have a fan who still remembers you. Thank you. I'm not a fan anymore, unfortunately. Mr. Chairman. You're here early. Traffic must not have been bad. Who is this? Someone I know. How do you know him? He's the man I'm dating. This is my father. Hello, I'm Kang Ma-ru. Did you eat? Let's eat. I have brunch here five times a week. The food is very good. Thank you. I can't believe this. This is the first time you ever introduced a boyfriend to me, I believe. That's right. What do your parents do? They both passed away. My father was a drug peddler who sold drugs in markets. My mother passed away right after she gave birth to me. Oh, dear. You must have had a tough life after losing both parents. How did you get through school? What do you do now? I was in college, but I had to quit. I'm working as a bartender right now. A bartender? A bartender. Did you quit college because of financial reasons? No. -You can ask him questions later-- -Then what was the reason? Why did you quit college? I didn't quit. I was expelled. You didn't quit, you were expelled. May I ask why? Stop it. -Why were you expelled from college? -Dad. If you're taking a census, I don't wish to answer anymore. You tell me. Tell me why he was expelled from his college. What did he do to get expelled from college? You don't know? You don't know either? You introduced him to me when you don't even know that much? That's not important to me. What? What's important to me is who he is now and what our future will be like. Why he got expelled from his college in the past, which I wasn't a part of, isn't important to me at all. What about you? The woman you decided to marry. The woman who seduced you when she was younger than I am now, knowing you had a wife and child. The woman who is only five years older than your daughter. How much do you know about her hypocrisy and past that she's been hiding? Sir. Sir. Min-yeong. This is all this girl amounts to. Was I really planning to put the future of Taesan in the hands of someone like her, who is nothing but a jealous and immature brat? Let's go. Sir. I said let's go. Yes, sir. You get rid of that young man. Give him what he wants. If you can't get rid of him easily, lock him up for blackmail. If you need muscle, you can call Mr. Jang. Dad! It's a mother's duty to take care of a child. What my daughter is doing and whom she is seeing. What foolish things she's doing. If her mother were alive, it would've been her role. It's your duty now. Dad, wait. Is your world that good even if this is how you're treated? What a waste. He left all the food. It's the best brunch I've ever had. Shall we begin with the negotiations? How much will you pay me to get lost? A billion won? You should hold a meeting with people in your town and come up with a new repertoire. I'm getting tired of the same story. Why are you doing this? What are you after? What are you after? What are you trying to pull, you bastard? What do you think? Do you want money? Should I give you money? A billion won? Sure. I'll give you a billion won. Do you want more? I'll give it to you. Tell me what you want. Anything. Are you... after revenge? Are you being childish and taking revenge for betraying you? What would you gain from that? At least benefit from it. Just ask for money! You sell your body for money anyway. Be smart. Think about Choco. You only live once. You can just take the money and live a posh life too! You've gone insane. That's why I plan to bring you back. I don't know how fancy and luxurious and great your world is, but it's no place for you. Someone like you shouldn't be there. Ma-ru. If someone like you stays there as if everything is fine, all justice, hope, order, and dreams will be lost in this world. The dark world that you detested when you were a reporter, which angered you and made you despair will come if someone like you stays there. If you won't come down, I'm coming up. I'm coming up to get you. Stop harming the world. Pack your things before I get there. So? Where do I belong? Where is that? That sewer? That endless sewer filled with crap? No. Even that's too good for you. Did I mess up? No. You did well. You don't have to apologize. I don't feel humiliated or degraded, so don't worry. Your family is as big of a mess as mine. It is. You're right. So, are you going to quit? I didn't accept any money. If they want to send me to prison for blackmail, I'll go to prison. I may look soft, but I'm tough. I can take a beating for three days. I had a nice time. It was fun. We didn't do much. It hasn't even been 12 hours since you said you wanted to see me. It's only been 12 hours, but I feel like I dated you for 12 months. I'm totally into you already. It's annoying as hell and it hurts my pride. Can you give up the throne for love? Is this goodbye? Bye. Take care of yourself. Since I'm being dumped out of nowhere, let's make it a kiss instead. This isn't the right place for that. Call me when you find a good spot. I'll come running. I finally found a woman I like. It would be sad if we had to part without a single kiss. Let's kiss and say goodbye, and go our separate ways. Take care until we meet again. It would be nice to meet soon. It would be even nicer if we meet later, since it'll delay our breakup. Come and pick it up when the bell rings. Thank you. WHAT AN UPGRADE You did this, didn't you? -I did not. -I know you did it. Why do you think it was me? Because you're jealous. You like Jae-gil. My dream guy is Ashton Kutcher. See? Jae-gil looks just like Ashton Kutcher. That's true. -He does, but-- -Actually, Jae-gil is better looking. His eyes are much more doe-like. I was going to say that. Anyway, it's true that Jae-gil looks the most like my dream guy, but that doesn't mean I like him. Yes, you do. You like him. -I do not. -I'm an expert at stuff like this. I said I don't! Miss. What are you doing? How do you feel? What do you expect? I don't feel anything. What a joke. Your legs grew weak just from kissing a picture of him. But what? You don't like him? I don't like it. She's totally making me nervous. Yu-ra! What's wrong? Jae-gil. Stop crying. -Was it Choco? -Yes. Yes. I'm so upset, I could just die. You and I both know that I'm a natural beauty, and that I'm pretty without any makeup. Heaven knows it's true. Calm down. Let's calm down and sit for a bit. Should we? Don't cry. Even if you fixed your entire face, my love for you wouldn't change, so stop crying. I'll scold Choco for you. Where is she, anyway? Over there. But Jae-gil. The truth is, she stepped on my foot just a minute ago too. Intentionally. On purpose. It hurt. She stepped on it hard. Why? Seriously... Is it a crime to be pretty? Stop. If it were a crime, we would've been executed. Choco. Apologize to her. Say it in Korean! I'm sorry. It was just a joke. If you throw a stone at a frog as a joke, it will die. You didn't die. -If she died, I would have-- -Killed me? I'll beat you just short of death and then die to be with her. Jae-gil. Oh, my God. Apologize for the other thing too. What are you talking about? All I did was draw on the shirt. You stepped on her foot. What do you mean? When did I step on her foot? I did no such thing. My toes are throbbing where she stepped on me. Hey, old lady! I didn't step on her. I swear I didn't. I swear. Does it hurt a lot? Want to go to the hospital? No. I hate hospitals. Shots hurt too much. Just carry me all the way home. And don't be too mad at Choco. Come to think of it, it is my fault. It's not her fault that I'm so pretty that it makes people mad. I'm so upset. Choco. Listen. Everyone has a destiny because of their looks. One for good-looking people, and one for ugly people. Everyone has their own path and lot in life. It only makes you look pathetic if you invade someone else's path. Like you do now. You'd better not do this again. I don't care if you're my friend's sister. You can hurt me, but I won't let anyone hurt Yu-ra. Do you understand? Am I heavy? DIRECTOR SEO EUN-GI What are you talking about? Repeat what you just said. I don't understand what you said. The chairman said to exclude you from all duties for a while. What nonsensical gibberish is that? Exclude me from my duties? Are you saying you're firing me? -Is that what you're saying? -I don't think that's it. We heard there was an unfortunate incident during brunch with the chairman recently. Brunch? Unfortunate incident? Oh, that. There was. I introduced someone he could never like as my boyfriend. I fought back and asked why he could do it and I can't. Is that what this is about? Regardless, I think you should reflect and stay low until he calms down. -As instructed, stop all your work and-- -Ms. Hyun. How can I drop all of my work? I have to meet dozens of buyers today alone. There are dozens of decisions that I must make. You should do as she suggests. You should follow the chairman's orders. Must the chairman's orders be followed blindly? Does this company belong only to him? Ma'am. -Ma'am. -Never mind. I don't know what order he gave, but tell him I cannot and will not follow that order. Tell him I'm attending this morning's meeting. Ma'am. Wouldn't it be better to follow his orders for now? You should wait until... Open the door. It's locked. Ms. Seo. Open the door! I'm here for the meeting. I'm the director of Taesan Group! I'm here to work! Please refer to the handout. -Open the door. -Let's move... -The door is locked. Open the door! -on to the next page. This is regarding the acquisition of Jumyeong Electronics. Comparing the figures to those of the first quarter, you'll see... The door is locked. Open the door! Shall we move on to the next page? Open the door! I'm here for the meeting. Open the door! Currently... I'm the director, and I'm here to work! Its market share is approximately 38%. The combined market power... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. Let's continue with the meeting. Tests are currently being run... By acquiring Jumyeong Electronics, Taesan can establish a foundation to become number one in electronics. The problem is a lack of funds to carry out the acquisition. How much do we lack? Even if we exclude costs for expansion, such as equipment manufacturing costs, we'll need at least 120 billion won more. Are there any assets we can liquidate? There aren't any at the moment. The overseas resources we've developed since 2009 to generate funds all fell through and became useless. How about postponing the construction of the Ulsan medical complex? We've invested 56 billion won over the past two years. Construction will be complete in six months. What about the Pyeongtaek industrial complex? It's a designated international new city. We can't touch that. There is one place we've been overlooking for a while. We could sell the Aomori resort. -You can't do that. -Go on. We'll have to study the figures, but Rolling from the US offered 103.5 billion won in 2009. If we indicate a willingness to sell, they may offer a higher price. You can't sell the Aomori resort. That resort is-- It's not like 103.5 billion won is a small sum. You think they'll offer more? Rolling is planning a business in Aomori. From what I know, Rolling's CEO is an old friend of Madam Han Jae-hui. Madam Han Jae Hui? Eun-seok's mother? Yes. Rolling's CEO owes her from when Madam Han was a reporter-- I'll look into it. I'll find a way come up with the funds for the acquisition. -Please leave the resort alone-- -Go on. If Madam Han would get involved and talk to him, it is very possible. I just received word that Rolling's executive team is in Aomori now. Not Aomori. You can't sell that resort. -That's where Mom-- -Get out. -Get her out of here. -Dad. There are no "dads" here! There's 120 billion won on the line. How dare you cry "daddy" and talk about your mom? How can you run the company with a mentality like that? Aren't you embarrassed? Pursue selling the resort. -Sir. -Since the team from Rolling in Japan, hit the ground running. Jae-hui will be involved in management soon anyway. Let's consider it training and put her in charge of this project. Mr. Ahn, what do you think? I believe she is more than capable. She's necessary to make this deal happen anyway. Okay, then. Put her in charge for now. Since you know the most about this project, I'd like you to assist her. Yes, sir. I will. KANG MA-RU NEUROTOMY THE GOOD PHYSICIAN TREATS THE DISEASE THE GREAT PHYSICIAN TREATS THE PATIENT WHO HAS THE DISEASE BY WILLIAM OSLER May I help you? Are you here to see my brother? He's not answering his phone. -Is he not home? -No. I saw him go out earlier. Do you know where he went? No. I'm Kim Yun-ju. Tell him I was here and ask him to call me. Please. Be careful of my brother. Be careful. He's the best brother in the world to me, but he may be a total douche and a real mean jerk to women like you. What do you mean? He's a total player. He's not answering your calls because he's seeing someone else. How could you diss your brother like that? I know, right? But it's true. Why are you telling me this? As I told all the other women who came by before, the only reason he dated you was for money. He needed money because of me. That's why he lied to all of you. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Were you home? Yes. I was looking for something. See you later. Did you hear that? What? The conversation I just had with that woman who came looking for you. I did. Just kill me. After all I did to save your life? I can't kill you that easily. You did well. I have to go. It's time for you to date a woman you love. Someone you really love. When you brought that woman all the way to Jumunjin, I thought you found someone you loved. I was so happy. You must be feeling better. You're nagging me now. See you later. Forget Jae-hui. You can't date anyone else because you haven't gotten over her. That woman who was just here looked pretty and nice. She seemed to really like you. We could never imagine dating someone like that. Please, Ma-ru. Jae-hui won't come back to you. Did I say anything? What about you? How long will you wait for Ashton Kutcher? How long do you have to wait for him to accept your love? Which Ashton Kutcher? You can't date anyone else because you haven't gotten over her. UNKNOWN CALLER Who's this? It's Seo Eun-gi. Did you find a place for our kiss already? Name ten people who gave up the throne for love. Go on. Edward VIII. And? Princess Pyeonggang, Princess Nangnang, Princess Seonhwa. And? Shrek, Princess Fiona. And? Gu Jun-pyo from Boys Over Flowers. Do you want more? What are you doing? I'm standing outside my house, answering your quiz. I want to see you. Where are you? I'll come to you. I'm in Japan. Aomori. There's a resort that my mom loved. The memories I have of her and with her are all from here. But the chairman and his new wife want to sell it. I came to stop that. The probability that I'll fail is 90 percent. Anyway, if I can't stop it, I plan to give up the throne. To be more honest, I'll be kicked out. Even if I'm poor, -I-- -I'll take you in. My house is run-down, but there are many rooms. I have a room, my sister has a room, and my friend has a room. We have about seven or more sets of bowls, plates and utensils. We have blankets and pillows too. Since I have a place to go to, if I have to give up, I'll give up quickly. If I have to surrender, I'll surrender quickly. Wish me luck until then. What brings you here? Are you on a trip? Well, you must have a lot of time since you're not working these days. Thanks to you. I don't have to work thanks to you, and have nothing to do. I came to ruin things for you. To do what? You heard me. I'm going to stop what you came to do. You? How? I found a way to get the funds for the acquisition without selling the resort. I, Seo Eun-gi, found a way after putting in hard work and diligence. Aren't you proud of me? You came all this way for nothing. You should soak in the hot springs since you're here anyway. You can go with your son. A bluff only works on people below you. For example, young, foolish, and naive people like you. I told you. You're no match for me. -Listen. -Like you said, I'm halfway to my destination. You may think it was smooth sailing and easy for me. How would you know what obstacles were in the way, how I overcame them, and what I did to get this far? You could never know. I have a destination that I must reach, and I'll get there no matter what it takes. I won't forgive anyone who gets in my way. Regardless of who that is. KANG MA-RU So... stop messing around and get out of my way. Once again, you're no match for me. You're not working anyway. You should soak in the hot springs, go sightseeing, and get some rest since you're here anyway. Okay? KANG MA-RU I have a destination that I must reach, and I'll get there no matter what it takes. I won't forgive anyone who gets in my way. Regardless of who that is. SEO EUN-GI'S TREE, MARCH 5, 1983 GROW UP HEALTHY AND PRETTY I'll find a way. Don't worry. I can do it. I'm Seo Eun-gi. I won't lose that easily. Trust me, Mom. FUNDS NEEDED FOR JUMYEONG ACQUISITION TAESAN'S FINANCES TAESAN'S INTERNAL INVESTMENTS You moron. Not yet. I won't throw in the towel yet. I won't give up yet. I won't surrender yet. Hey, sleepyhead. You should wake up. You've slept enough. Wake up. Let's go kill them all. I came because I missed you. I'll go back. I'll go back to you. Since when did you become Jae-hui's dog? Do I have to wait and stop if you tell me to wait and stop? Look here! Is there no limit to how low you will fall? Don't go. Don't go to Eun-gi! I wonder what's on the ocean floor. Jae-hui! Let's go all the way and see.
