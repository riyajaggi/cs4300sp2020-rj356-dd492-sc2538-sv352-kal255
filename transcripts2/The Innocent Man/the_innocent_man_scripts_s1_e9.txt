 I said let's come together. Why did you come alone? I suddenly wanted to see the ocean. Thanks for the clothes and shoes. How did you know my size so well? You must be a player. Something like that. It's much better than the picture, isn't it? I didn't know there was such a beautiful place in Korea. It's not... your first time here, is it? It is my first time.

 I was supposed to come with someone before, but we never made it. With whom? Someone I loved. Who was that? Han Jae-hui. How long have you known about my relationship with Jae-hui? Is that important? Why didn't you let on? Because I didn't want to lose you. You must have known why I approached you. It doesn't matter.

 Your feelings weren't important. My feelings were important. Whatever the case may be, I just want to have you. Do you... want to sleep with me? Why didn't you ask once? Because it's Jae-hui that I want, not you. If you still can't give up on me and if you think it's possible for us, I could change my mind. If you're not a useless person who gave up everything for a man, but the heir of Taesan Group, I could switch over to you. Will you do that? Then I'll... seriously think about it. I have... a question. Was everything you said and showed me calculated and planned? Probably. Even... when you got that doll for me on the cliff? Probably. Are you a moron? One wrong step, and you could have fallen down the cliff and died. You would risk that just to seduce a woman? If you had died, your life would've been over. Forget getting Jae-hui back. You're not making any sense. Why are you lying? The Kang Ma-ru that I've seen... The Kang Ma-ru that I know... He wasn't the fake person standing before me now. That's why I gave up everything and came to you like a crazy person. Let's run away. If it won't work out here, If we can't live here, let's go to another country and live in hiding. I'll follow you anywhere you want to go. Let's go somewhere where nobody knows us and live there. That's why you fell for me. You saw me pretend to put my life on the line for you. That's why... an ill-tempered, distrusting, and arrogant woman like you... fell for me just like that. Do you think there was anything I couldn't do to get Jae-hui back? STOCK REPORT JOON-HA Hello? The first step of what you ordered is complete. MY FAMILY, ME, MOMMY, DADDY, MY SISTER Sir. Will you please reconsider? It's Eun-gi's birthday tomorrow, I believe. Right? Yes, sir. It is. Where have you been? You should have called. Why is your face all banged up? Where have you been? What did you do? Jae-hui! TAESAN SECURITIES ACCOUNTING FRAUD TAESAN ELECTRONICS OVERSEAS FUNDS Why... Why do you have this? It's a copy that I kept just in case. I never thought there would come a day when I'd have to use it. You... - You... - I... put my life on the line to protect you. I ruined the life of the man I loved more than life itself. How... How could you? How could you do this to me? You didn't trust me either, Mr. Chairman. You were always suspicious of me and had me watched. Why did you do it? Was it because of the scar Eun-gi's mom gave you? You only loved one person. I know that Eun-gi's mom is still the one that possesses your heart, and that she's the only one you ever loved. It doesn't matter. I loved... someone else this entire time, too. Divide everything equally between Eun-seok and Eun-gi. If you do that, I'll leave everything you gave me and leave this house with nothing. I'll accept any punishment for betraying you. Please. Please, just this once. Eun-seok is your son, too! Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! Wake up, Mr. Chairman! What are you doing? Mr. Ahn. He's going to die anyway. It's just happening a few months sooner. He enjoyed... all the power, fame and wealth in his life that other people can't even dream of. He shouldn't be too upset about leaving this world. Crazy bastard. Help! You asked for help. You said you wanted to live here for a long time. You said you didn't want to return to the hellish sewer. You asked for my help. We have no choice. Think about the one person you have to protect right now. For me, that person is you. For you, it's Eun-seok. Just think about Eun-seok, your reason for living. CHAIRMAN SEO JOON-HA The chairman passed away. Call me. Chairman Seo Jeong-gyu of Taesan Group passed away today. He managed the company for 30 years since his father, who founded the company, passed away. He grew the company so expeditiously, that many said he re-founded the company. Although he was suffering from a prolonged illness, he was still actively involved in managing the group. He is survived by his wife, Han Jae-hui, a son, and a daughter. This is a news flash. The late Chairman Seo Jeong-gyu's daughter, Seo Eun-gi, was critically injured in a car accident an hour ago. The accident happened in a tunnel in Gangwon. Seo Eun-gi's car crossed the yellow line and collided with a car head-on. Kang, the driver of the other car, is also in critical condition. Seo Eun-gi is the only daughter of the late Chairman Seo Jeong-gyu. She was the first in line to succeed him as Chairman of Taesan. FIRST IN LINE TO SUCCEED AS CHAIRMAN PARK YONG-SU Should I take you home? No. Your brother and sister-in-law are waiting for you. Yeah right. I doubt that. Young master. They're probably terrified that I'll come back since Dad is dead, and try to take a piece of the pie. It's so obvious. I heard my brother went above and beyond being my dad's puppet. I hear he's much worse than my dad. Why does he live like that? Isn't he afraid of karma? It's not like he can take the money with him when he dies. MISSING PERSON 300 MILLION WON REWARD Thank you. She's pretty. MISSING PERSON 300 MILLION WON REWARD You still haven't found her? - No. - I saw on the news that she disappeared from the hospital. How long has she been missing? It's been 11 months now. Maybe she's dead... as people say. If you haven't heard from her for almost a year, she's probably dead, right? Who will get Taesan Group if she doesn't return? CHAIRMAN SEO JOON-HA Joon-ha. Hey, Joon-ha. How is the chairman? He's not dead, is he? I don't think the path I'm taking is different from yours. I asked you if he's dead! I recorded everything you two said on my phone. I'm taking this to the police right now. Go ahead. Go to the police. There's something else you should take with you to the police. It's proof that your dad, Park Young-pyo, ordered the car accident in which Eun-gi's mother died. You're lying. I know you're cornered, but how can you say something so outrageous? Your dad did something that outrageous. I tried to stop him, since he trusted me the most, but there was no way of stopping him. He was excessively loyal. She had threatened the chairman that she'd take Ms. Seo with her. She demanded custody of Eun-gi. That can't be. That can't be. I'll send the proof to Eun-gi, and let her decide whether or not it can't be. I'm sure she's smart enough figure it out. How will she feel when she finds out that your dad was responsible for her mom's death? I spoke to the contacts for the duty free store bidding. Who is the competition? Mirae Group and Jinseon Group. It looks like the CEO of Mirae Department Store is attending the bazaar. She's Mirae Group's chairman's wife. Ms. Jo? And you are? I'm Han Jae-hui, the CEO of Taesan Group. Oh, Taesan. I heard there was a new CEO. It's nice to meet you. Please give me guidance. I need it. I heard rumors that Taesan's new CEO was incredibly beautiful. I guess they weren't false rumors. You flatter me. It's an honor to meet you. I hear Taesan is working very hard to win the bid for the duty free store. Let us compete fairly. Yes, of course. Ms. Han. You applied for a VVIP membership at our hotel's club, right? I did. I instructed them not to accept you. If someone who has no class like you becomes a member, our members would be very upset and offended. What do you... mean by that? You must be seriously confused after being Chairman Seo's mistress for so many years. You're a dog guarding an empty house. You're not the owner, Jae-hui. Excuse me. What? You want my guidance? You might have been able to seduce an old man, but not me. You rude brat. That's a bit excessive. Not at all! I'm holding back and being nice because I don't want to stoop to your level. You're no CEO of a company. You must be trying to prove yourself with the duty free store bid since people are criticizing you so much behind your back. Stop kidding yourself and forget about it. Don't do anything. Just stay down. Know your place. Just wait until Seo Eun-gi, the owner of Taesan, returns. Remain a loyal dog, and guard the house quietly. Do you understand? Eun-gi's mom was my best friend until she died. Place your bets. You win ten times if you choose well. You could change your life. - It's a chance of a lifetime. - You're fast. - It's here. - Here. I say here. Anyone else? Okay. I'll open them. You want to bet? Here goes. I'm sorry. Next. - Did you bet 100,000 won? - That's right. Ten times that is... three, four, five, six... - Dang it. I'm losing everything I have. - Thank you. Okay! Half this time! - Fifty-fifty. - Fifty-fifty! It's one or the other. Which one is it? I say number one. Fifty-fifty are good odds! Really. You could easily win your money back. Anyone else? -20 times! -20 times! You could win 20 times your bet! I'll just go empty handed. - I can't wait. - Come on, show us. - No more bets? - No. You want to bet? You all bet on number one. I really might have to go home empty-handed. Okay. Here goes. Too bad. I'm so sorry. You poor dear. What the hell? What are you doing? This is so odd. Shouldn't this ball be in the cup? Good job on being decoys, all of you. You're the decoys, right? One, two, three, four. Who the hell are you? Don't do that again. Someone like you could never beat them. It's designed that way. My dad did this at one time. Excuse me, but... who are you? I'm Kang Ma-ru. You didn't eat yet, did you? I was going to kill myself... if I lost that money. You saved my life. Thank you. Why are you using money from loan sharks to do that? I thought... I could win the interest. My wife is very sick. Her medicine costs up to 300,000 won a month. But... how did you know I borrowed from loan sharks? Quit gambling from this moment forth. Why do you gamble every night? Don't you know they are all set-ups? Who... are you? I'm going to make an offer you can't refuse. Do you want to hear it? Mr. Jung Mu-gil, Chief of R&D; at Juho Electronics. You know... my name, too? Who are you? Just who are you? That's not what's important right now. I know a bit... about your wife's illness. You're going to keep needing more money. You have to pay back all your debts. Your children have to go to college. Who sent you? That's not important either right now. The AMOLED technology that your center developed. Get that for me, and you won't have to worry about money for the rest of your life. I don't know which competitor sent you, but how much do you get paid for doing something like this? A lot. An insane amount. I heard you didn't eat all day. I heated some milk. Drink it. I don't want it! You punk! She brought that for you! I'll ask when my brother comes home. You seem to be mistaken. My brother would never do that. I can swear to that. Do you want to bet 10,000 won? Ma-ru. He said you conned his dad, and that... he tried to commit suicide and is in the hospital. That wasn't you, right? Who's your dad? He retired last year. He was conned and lost his severance pay. He tried to take his life a few days ago in a public bath... You had nothing to do with it, right? You can't just leave. Tell him it has nothing to do with you. Set him straight. Your dad is stupid and weak. Why is that my fault? Ma-ru. Does everyone who was conned die? Ma-ru! Nobody told him to fall for it. Why did he trust people? It's not like he knew me. How well did he know me? He was reckless. Your dad was the imbecile for trusting me. So? What are you going to do with this weak fist? If it makes you that mad, come back when you're strong. If you want revenge, gain strength and then come back. Okay? It was better when you were a gigolo. It was better when you made money by manipulating women. Are you sleeping? Choco said it seems like someone else is living in your body... ever since that car accident. It's like the Ma-ru that we knew died, and a strange soul is living in your body. She wants to go to a shaman and have an exorcism. I'm sure you were scared, too. Someone almost died because of you. You were traumatized, weren't you? Do you... want to die soon? You'll do anything that pays big, to give Choco enough money for her medical bills for the rest of her life. Then you'll say screw the world... and die, aren't you? You seem like a desert without a single living thing in it. You have zero will to live. It's like you don't care about Choco or anything, and are desperate to die as soon as possible! It makes me nervous. I'm scared to death, you punk. Don't be like that, Ma-ru. You were able to endure it when Jae-hui left. I couldn't have done it, but miraculously, you did it. You made it through all the tough stuff. Why are you doing this? Don't. Don't be like this. Don't be like this. Jae-hui. - You can go. Leave the car. - Yes, ma'am. How are you training your housekeepers? They wouldn't open the door for the Madam's brother. I waited for five hours. You were paid to never come here again. We're the only family either of us has. Come on. I'm really hurt. - Let's go inside. - Where? Here. My sister's house. Did you gamble again? You lost all that money already? Is that why you came here again like a beggar? A beggar? Go ahead and hit me. I'll make sure you rot in prison for 20 years this time, so go ahead and hit me. Sure. What's the use in hitting you? I won't give you another penny, so get lost. - Yes, Madam Chairman. - I'm thirsty. Have a glass of water ready. Hey. Hey! Madam... You must be seriously confused after being Chairman Seo's mistress for so many years. You're a dog guarding the empty house. You're not the owner, Jae-hui. Come up to Eun-gi's room right now. Yes, Ma'am. I'm going to turn this room into a playroom for Eun-seok. Call people to empty it out tomorrow. Pardon? - If Ms. Seo returns-- - Nobody is coming back! Do you believe she'll come back too? Are you waiting for her to return? She should have returned already then. It's been almost a year since she disappeared. We searched everywhere for her the past year. We spent all that money and hired all those people. We searched everywhere, even overseas. We left no stone unturned. We did everything we could, but she was nowhere to be found. Eun-gi wasn't anywhere! Yes. Get rid of all of her things first thing tomorrow. 300 MILLION WON REWARD Thanks to a man named Kang Ma-ru, I'm happy to be alive and to breathe for the first time ever. Now, my only wish right now... is to see you every day, tell you I love you every day, hear you tell me you love me every day, share the same dream with you, have a child, and raise the child together... and just grow old together. Is that possible? MISSING PERSON 300 MILLION WON REWARD You're not making any sense. Why are you lying? The Kang Ma-ru that I've seen... The Kang Ma-ru that I know... He wasn't the fake person standing before me now. That's why I gave up everything and came to you like a crazy person. Hello, Ms. Jo. What's wrong with this place? Is anyone stray dog allowed in here? - Get me the manager. - I'd like you to take a look at this picture first. It's my husband. What about it? What about this one? Leave us. Why did you meet my husband? You seemed displeased by my request for your guidance, so I asked your husband instead. I asked him to advise this newcomer to management on managing a group. He rushed over to meet me within ten minutes after I called him. I said I was in no rush. You conniving bitch. Yes. I don't want to admit it, but I guess I am. There wasn't a man I couldn't seduce if I put my mind to it. So... I plan to decide how far I go depending on your attitude and will. - Hey! - What should I do? Kicking you out and taking your place as his wife would be too easy and lame for me. Why you little... Hey. Let go. Let go of me! I seduced Chairman Seo, who was a million times more devoted than your husband, gave him a son, and became the CEO of Taesan Group. That's who I am. Don't you think it will be way too easy for me to seduce your husband, even if you think about it? What do you want? First, forfeit your invitation to bid for the duty free store to me. Second, lift the ban on Taesan Clothing at Mirae Department Store. That is just childish and immature. Third. Get down on your knees right this instant and beg for forgiveness for insulting me. Have a nice day. You should tell me if you need to pee. A four-year-old shouldn't be peeing in her pants. How embarrassing. You did well. Choco. What are you doing? Shouldn't you be cleaning? Okay. My dad died. I'm sadder than I thought I'd be, but I'm trying to be strong and smiling. So stop being mad. And smile! If we believe in him, Ma-ru will come back to us. Jae-gil. Hello, Mr. Jung. Did you think about it? You made the right decision. Where should we meet? No, not there. I'd like to buy you a drink today. Damn it. I left the car keys on the hood. I'll be right back. Stay here. Don't go anywhere, okay? TOILET I have to use the toilet. Come on! I have to use the toilet! What took you so long? KANG Kang Ru-ma? What's Kang Ru-ma? It's not Kang Ru-ma. It's Kang Ma-ru. How does that say, "Kang Ma-ru"? It says, "Kang Ru-ma." She must not know how to spell. Yeah. She must be stupid. - I can spell. - Me, too. - Can you write well? - Yes. - Who taught you? - My mom read to me a lot. Is this right then? "Kang Ma-ru." Oh, my... She must really be stupid. How could an adult not know how to spell? - Who is that? - Who is he? That's my crayon. KANG MA-RU - Jae-geon, Ju-eun, let's eat. - Okay! Yes. Now I remember. Kang Ma-ru. I knew that. You know me. Right? It is you. You're Kang Ma-ru. I... lost my memory. I was told I was in a car accident. That's why I don't remember anything. I only know that my name is Seo Eun-gi because I worked hard to memorize it. All I have left is this camera. But you're the only person in here. KANG MA-RU The person who took care of me said the person in these photos was Kang Ma-ru. That's why I came. I couldn't remember who Kang Ma-ru was... or who the man in these photos was... at all earlier. But it came back to me as soon as I saw your face. I remember who you are now. We were... deeply and madly... in love, weren't we? I'd like to make a motion. The dismissal of Seo Eun-gi, the CEO of Taesan Resort. Why me? You were the only person she trusted and loved. In love? Who? Us? My heart remembered you. I'll make sure she doesn't return to Taesan ever again. Do you think we can go back to the way things were? I won't let her come back. Ever. Who are you?
