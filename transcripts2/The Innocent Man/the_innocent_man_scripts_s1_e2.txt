 Stop it. Just stop. If anything happens to her... If she dies... Stop, Ma-ru! You're not even a doctor. Stop! Her blood pressure and pulse are returning to normal. She's getting color back in her face. She's not out of the woods yet. Continue to check her blood pressure and pulse. This flight will be landing in about ten minutes...

 Is a medical team waiting at the airport? Yes, they are. I'm sure she can last ten minutes. I did everything I could. Thank you. The doctor administered first aid very well. It was Jae-hui, right? Well... I wondered how you were doing, so I went to the business class cabin, and... See? I was right. There was a rumor that she became Taesan Group chairman's mistress. You were the only one who refused to believe it. When I told you about the rumor, you beat the crap out of me.

 I had a feeling it was true. When you first went to prison, she came to visit all the time. Then she started visiting less and less until she stopped visiting at all. I knew then. My love left My love left me cruelly There's something I just don't get. Why did you kill that man? The Kang Ma-ru I knew wanted to become a doctor to save people. He had a nasty temper, but he could never kill anyone. There must have been a reason that night. I'm sure there was a reason why you had to say you killed him. Choco said you went to see Jae-hui that night. Choco was sick, but you ran out because Jae-hui sounded urgent. What happened to her? What was so urgent? - Am I your driver? - Hey! Am I your driver? Why do you always sit in the back? It's... It's a habit. You... You know I grew up rich. I'll sit in the front! Fine! You could have just said so. Shit. Hey. Hey! Ma-ru! Where are you going? Ma-ru! Hey! I can't drive! You lunatic! Choco. You should tell me if you need to pee. A four-year-old shouldn't be peeing in her pants. How embarrassing. Please... Hide me. Hey! Did a girl come in here? No. He's gone. This might sting a bit, but bear with me. My dream is to become a doctor. I'm Ma-ru. Kang Ma-ru. I'm Jae-hui. - Han Jae-hui. - I know. You're the prettiest girl in town. Ma-ru, I heard you got the highest grades in the department again. I envy you. I think I failed again. Why is a reporter's test more difficult than the bar exam? I'm so stupid. Is the Oseong Group chairman's daughter still hung up on you and chasing you around? Yes. Why don't you go out with her? If you score a girl like her, your life will be set. She must be ugly. She's pretty. Why don't you date her then? Do you have an inferiority complex? Sure, you're dirt poor compared to that conglomerate family, but you're a good catch when you set all that aside. You go to the top medical college in the country. You're a genius, the top student, incredibly good looking, and have an amazing personality. You'll become a great doctor soon too. She would've struck gold. Can't you be the one to strike gold? I'd like it if you were the one to strike gold. Unless you don't want to. I do. I do! A man never goes back on his word. You can't change your mind. You'll burn in hell if you betray me. You're mine now. I've claimed you. Stop. Forget it. It's different now. Her feelings have changed. I'm not the same person anymore, either. It's over. It's... over now. Ms. Seo. Ms. Seo. Hey. Can you eat like that so soon? Shouldn't you be eating porridge? These morons. Do they get paid to do crappy work like this? The person who administered first aid on me on the plane wasn't a doctor? That's what I heard. They entrusted my life with someone who wasn't even a doctor? Who decided such-- Ms. Seo. Do you know I almost died because of that quack? Nonetheless, he saved your life. I almost died because of that quack! You know what? I heard that quack and Jae-hui seemed to know each other. What do you think about that, Mr. Park? I'm not sure what you mean. Hey. What's up? How much? Find out where she's going with that money, whom she's meeting, and what she's spending it on. Jae-hui withdrew a billion won from the bank. Where is that womanizer? - Let go of him. - He's your friend. - You must know where your friend is! - Please... They say he hasn't been to work for the past few days. Where is that bastard? Stop it. He... He immigrated. Immigrated? What a bunch of crap. Do you think I'll let him get away after ruining my family? Honey, stop. Please stop. - You were married? - What? I can't say my friend is not exactly a womanizer per se, but he'd never touch a married woman even if it was Angelina Jolie. He always sticks to his principles. You must've lied that you were divorced. - You little... - That's not right. He can always tell whether a woman is married or divorced. How far did you go with him? - Did you sleep with him? - Hey! No! I did not! It's not like that. I told you you were jumping to conclusions. Like hell, it's not! You have a picture of him in your cell phone and stare at it all day! - You and he... - Seriously. That's what this is about? He has a lot of fans like her who love him. Jangchung Stadium wouldn't be big enough to fit all of them. His fan club from grade school still gathers and offers him tribute. This is nothing. Hey! Where are you going? It's not his fault he's good looking. Does he have to take responsibility for her crush? Will he date me if I get a divorce? - What? - Hey! I want a divorce. - What? - You blatantly cheat. Why can't I? You won't even let me have a crush and look at a picture? I want to divorce you and become qualified to date him, and date him proudly. Hey! Are you crazy? Honey, you're the only one for me! This is all because of global warming. The climate is driving everyone crazy. The world is crazy and people are crazy. Jae... Jae-hui. Were they talking about Ma-ru? What... has he been doing? She's fine. She's much better than last time. Just remember what I said earlier and she'll be all right. Thank you. Let's go, Choco. I'm still sick. Nothing is better. What does the doctor know? I'm the one who's sick. Okay. I'm not all right. I'm sick. - Okay. - I'm really sick. Okay. I'm not faking it. I'm very, very sick. You're right. You look very sick. - I want to go clubbing. - Wait a month. - I want to drink. - Wait a month for that too. What's this crap? I can't go clubbing or drink. I can't go to school. Do you call this living? Just breathing doesn't mean you're living. I should have just died that day. Choco. I could have died if Jae-gil had come a little later. - Kang Choco. - Don't pretend to be nice now. You abandoned me that day! You were obsessed with Jae-hui. Your sister was sick and dying, but you left. It's your fault that I'm so sick. If I die, it's your fault! I'm tired from all that yelling. Carry me. It costs a few million won whenever Choco faints. Actually, it can cost tens of millions of won. Ma-ru's dad died of a heart attack and left a pile of debt. His son who excelled in everything suddenly went to prison and became an ex-con. What parent could go on living? He had no choice. He offered to sell his organs and stuff, but that wasn't enough. An ex-con in this country can't make money using conventional methods to pay off his dad's debt and pay his sister's medical bills. That's nearly impossible. It doesn't matter how smart or capable you are. No one hires ex-cons. He would have gone off and died if it weren't for Choco. He wouldn't have lived like this. He's hanging in there with all he's got because of his sister. Why is God so cruel only to him? What did he ever do wrong? Why don't you leave this neighborhood? Is it because of money? No. It's because of you. If we moved, you couldn't find him. That's why we couldn't leave. He didn't know you left him for another man. He wouldn't believe it even when I told him. He waited like a fool every day. That idiot. Jae-gil. What? What's up? Was someone here? Yeah. - Choco has to lie down. - Okay. What did the doctor say? She'll be all right if she's careful. Jae-hui was just here. Did you see her leave? She said to give this to you. She said she was paying you back. She said to move. She said to quit what you're doing and live a proper life. She also said to forget about her. A billion... A billion won? I thought it would have been at most maybe 10 million won. Because she felt sorry for you... Do you think she brought the wrong envelope? Maybe it was meant for someone else. Ma-ru. I killed him. I killed him. You don't know anything about this. Don't. Don't do this! Leave. Get out of here! Don't look back. Just... look forward. Go. I won't forget this. I will repay you for the rest of my life. I swear. Did you go somewhere? I ran away from the hospital while the nurses weren't looking. Dr. Kim sounds like he's pissed off. Put in a good word for me. Tell him I'm fine, and that I can digest anything now. I'm glad you recovered quickly. Thanks to you. First aid was administered well on the plane. That wasn't me. It was that doctor. Doctor? I heard he wasn't a doctor. Oh. He quit before he graduated from his medical college. He must have been good since he saved-- So, did you meet that man who isn't a doctor, but is just as good? I was going to interrogate you for the thrill of it, but I don't feel so well today. I'll just throw a fastball. Why did you give him a billion won? To that man who isn't a doctor, but is just as good. What are you talking about? I had put a tail on you, Jae-hui, since a week after my mom was kicked out and passed away. For revenge. To find your weakness and kick you out like my mom. That's a bit excessive. What's excessive? I told you my strategy. A psycho like you who puts on an angelic face and does who knows what behind people's backs is the one who's truly frightening. You withdrew a billion won and brought it to the home of that man who isn't a doctor, but is just as good. Photos were taken every ten seconds, too. Should we look at them now to help speed this along? It was to thank him for saving your life in such a dangerous situation. Eun-gi. I thought you were smart, but you're an airhead. What a let-down. "My lover's ex-wife's daughter lived because you administered first aid well on the plane. So, I'll give you a billion won to show my gratitude." You expect me to believe that? "Pretend to give first aid on the plane and kill my lover's ex-wife's daughter, Seo Eun-gi, without drawing any suspicions. Then I'll pay you a billion won." I won't listen to this. No need to get so excited. I just think that's a bit more convincing, that's all. I didn't give you any time to think of an excuse. If you think of another excuse, give me a call. I was blackmailed. He knew you were imprisoned in the US seven years ago for drug possession. That guy knew about that. I'm sure you know what will happen to you if the press or the shareholders find out about that. I hear the large shareholders are investigating you to oppose your succeeding the chairman. You have to be careful and avoid every little risk. I plan to get the billion won back from you with interest when all this is over. I'm the one who's disappointed. Help me. Help me just once. Eun-gi. We're not in Korea. My dad can't do anything because of my criminal record. If the press finds out about this somehow, I'll... You want me to lie for you and tell the police that the drugs were actually mine? Everyone knows we're dating anyway. I can't trust anyone else. Only you. Eun-gi. I'll do anything. Tell me what you want. I'll do anything you say. My dad said he'll do anything he could too, if you agree to help me. Including your company's problems. My company's problems? I hear Taesan is in trouble. I'm saying my dad can solve that for you. This isn't a bad deal. It's your first offense, so they'll go easy on you. If you look at the big picture, it's not a loss for you. Eun-gi. Eun-gi. KIM JEONG-HUN Hello? Hello? Honey, take the baby. The housekeeper and I both have food all over our hands. Sure. My princess, come to Daddy. Hello? Who is this? Are you still there? It's me, Eun-gi. Seo Eun-gi. Remember me? Hey. It's been a while. Why did you call out of the blue? I'd like to talk to you. About what? About... the drug possession charge I took for you. It wasn't because I wanted to save my company that was in danger. Because when I looked at the big picture, it wasn't a loss? That wasn't it either. That was because I loved you. Because that's how much I loved you. If I say that's why I did it, will you... believe me? Eun-gi... Asshole. - Hey. - Don't look for me for a while! I'm going away for a week. Don't call me unless it's necessary. It'll be international long distance. I won't. Did you go to return the money? Just return nine-tenths. Keep a tenth. Jae-hui would blow that money on a few designer bags--  Just worry about the woman who's with you. She looks like a crazy bitch in my eyes. Min-yeong, I'd like to talk to you after we eat. We should finish our conversation. Sure. - We'll have tea in my room. - Yes, sir. I'm done eating. I'll take him. You should finish eating, Madam. Okay. You should. - Get Eun-seok. He has to eat. - Yes, ma'am. Did you call the police? Yes. They need a statement from the person who was blackmailed and paid the guy off, so Madam Han will have to go to the police station in person. I pressed charges against him. Against that man who blackmailed you and extorted a billion won from you. You seemed busy with other things, so I tried to take care of it myself, but they need a statement from the blackmail victim. You need to press charges yourself. You shouldn't get scared and avoid scum like him. You should face them and fight. Even if it means we have to shed a little blood. It's for justice in this world. - Hi, Choco. - Ma-ru. Why are you crying? Are you sick again? The police are here looking for you. They're searching your room. Ma-ru! Ma-ru. Are you Kang Ma-ru? Yes, I am. I'm Detective Kim Gyeong-ho from the Jongno Precinct. Han Jae-hui pressed charges against you for blackmail. - What? - My brother never blackmailed anyone. He'd never do that. You need to come with us to the precinct. No. You can't take him. - No. - Calm down. Ma-ru... Who did you say pressed charges against me? Han Jae-hui. Ma-ru. No. Don't take my brother. Please. Ma-ru. No. Don't take my brother. Ma-ru. Just a minute. I'll be right back. It's no big deal. You'd never do that. You wouldn't do something like that! That's right, I wouldn't. So go home. Go home and change. Dry your hair. Boil some water and take your medicine. Just say you didn't do it! Say you would never do that. Tell them they made a mistake. Tell those guys to get lost! Okay, I will. Just go home. Go home, okay? No! I will not! If you don't go home, I won't either. No! The doctor said you can't be out in the rain. She said you could die! So what if I die? Die then. Get wet here and just die then! SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY It looks like it stopped raining. Let's go. What did you say I had to do? You have to confront the person who blackmailed you. Kang Ma-ru isn't admitting the charge. He's invoking his right to remain silent. That's why we had to do this. Han Jae-hui. According to your statement this morning, you said he blackmailed you with something that could harm your family, and that he extorted a billion won from you. Is that correct? Is that correct? Ma'am. Please repeat what you told us this morning in front of the accused. Ma'am. Madam. The man sitting here threatened my family. In exchange for keeping silent about a secret that would be detrimental to the company, he extorted a billion won from me. Do you admit the charge? Kang Ma-ru, do you admit the charge? I was going to understand. Do you admit the charge made against you? I was going to accept that I wasn't qualified to have you anymore. That we lived in completely different worlds now, since I knew that better than anyone. Kang Ma-ru. Are you not going to answer? I was going to let you go even if you didn't do this. I was going  to let you go to the person you wanted to be with. Kang Ma-ru! Are you going to keep remaining silent? We have no choice but to assume you admit the charge. Do you not care? Thank you. Madam. A letter came for you. There's no return address. TO: HAN JAE-HUI Thanks. CASHIER'S CHECK 100 MILLION WON What were you thinking? Are you in your right mind? The union was justified in asking that employees who worked over ten years be given permanent employment. There aren't many, so I determined that the risk wasn't high. The union agreed to wage freezes for the past two years. We should give something back-- You agree to one thing, but they won't be grateful for what they get. It's human nature to ask for more and more. That's how unions work! Sure, they'll thank you now. What will you do if they want more permanent positions? What if the economy hits bottom and we need restructuring? We can't fire people who have permanent positions. How do you plan to employ all those people? It's possible. If we continue to work with the union, it is more than possible. That's why people say you're a clueless little girl who doesn't know anything. Work with the union? Do you think they'll understand our position? They'd betray us and leave if they had a better offer. I tried so hard to teach you, but you still don't get it. Are you a moron? How long do I have to wait for you? How long do I have to wait, you stupid fool? I can't give Taesan to someone who can't protect it. There are other alternatives. There are Jae-hui and Eun-seok, too. If you can't take it, run. Run away like your mom. Are you all right? What do you think? I think it will scar. Get some rest. How did it go at the precinct? I heard he may be released for lack of evidence. I just got a call from Mr. Park. He's not admitting or denying anything. He's maintaining his silence. There isn't any evidence to support your claim. Where do you suppose he hid the billion won? You know my nickname is "Crazy Dog," right? The police can release him if they want to. But I don't plan to let him go. Of course, I don't know what your thoughts are. I have the money. He gave it back. Why? Because he failed his mission. He failed to kill Seo Eun-gi, my lover's ex-wife's daughter. He failed his mission and saved your life instead. If the large shareholders find out that you went to prison for drug possession seven years ago, it won't be a small problem. You could never succeed your father and manage the company. A third of them are already against it because you're young and female. Of course, that's good for me. For Eun-seok, too. It would get rid of you just like that. Thank you for finally coming clean. So? What's the point of this threat? You want to use that card and eliminate me for good? Why would I want to play such a boring game? It's so much fun toying with you. If you get as big and scary as I am, we can fight then. It will be a fair fight then. Let's see if you win and I die, or if you die and I win. For now, stop annoying me and pissing me off. Don't make me want to play that card, bitch. "He was walking in the woods when he met a boy named Smile. Smile was on his way to school. Nothing's Impossible said, 'Hi.' 'Hello,' replied Smile. 'I'm Smile.' 'Who are you?' the boy asked." DIRECTOR SEO EUN-GI POLICE THE PEOPLE CAN TRUST Choco. Choco. Choco. Kang Choco! Choco. Choco. Choco. Kang Choco! - Kang Choco. - She was taken to the hospital. - Sorry? - She got all wet in the rain yesterday and went out looking for you. She collapsed on the sloping road. Yong-sik's mom called an ambulance and they took her to the hospital. No. Don't take my brother. Ma-ru. I'll be right back. It's no big deal. Go home. No! I will not! If you don't go home, I won't either. No! The doctor said you can't be out in the rain. She said you could die! So what if I die? Die then. Get wet here and just die then! Don't pretend to be nice now. You abandoned me that day. You were obsessed with Jae-hui. Your sister was sick and dying, but you left her. It's your fault that I'm so sick. If I die, it's your fault! Do you know me? Why would you do that for me? Madam Han was in a very serious relationship with Kang Ma-ru. Are you afraid of Han Jae-hui? Are you that afraid of her? What's the world you live in like? Could someone like you understand if I explained it to you? What if I want something else? What will you do if I try to seduce you?
