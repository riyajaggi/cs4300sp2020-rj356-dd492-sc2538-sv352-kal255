 Are you... after revenge? Are you being childish and taking revenge for betraying you? What would you gain from that? At least benefit from it. Just ask for money! You sell your body for money anyway. I saw an animal documentary on TV a few months ago. A large jackal chased a small coyote and bit its tail. The coyote headed for the cliff because it didn't want to get eaten.

 If the jackal didn't let go, it would fall with the coyote. That was the only choice for the coyote. How tragic. I didn't get to watch the end because I had to go out. I wonder what happened to them. I wonder once in a while. If the jackal was wise, it would have let go of the tail. If it was foolish, it would've fallen off the cliff with the coyote and died. What do you think it did? I have a destination that I must reach, and I'll get there no matter what it takes. I won't forgive anyone who gets in my way.

 Regardless of who that is. The jackal probably fell off the cliff and died with the coyote. It was probably much more foolish and reckless than you think. It was an animal, but it must have been afraid of death. Don't you think it changed its mind at the edge of the cliff, realizing it would really die? No, I don't think it did that. However, it probably told the coyote that it was fortunate they could go together. And that at least it didn't have to die alone. Excuse me, I'm looking for Seo Eun-gi. Long time no see. SEO EUN-GI'S TREE, MARCH 5, 1983 GROW UP HEALTHY AND PRETTY DO NOT DISTURB. DO NOT KNOCK ON THE DOOR. DO NOT DISTURB. DO NOT KNOCK ON THE DOOR. You moron. The numbers don't match. Excuse me. The numbers don't match. SEO EUN-GI IS SUCH A FOOL HAN JAE-HUI FUNDS NEEDED FOR JUMYEONG ACQUISITION 35 BILLION WON I found a way to get the funds for the acquisition without selling the resort. A bluff only works on people below you. For example, young, foolish, and naive people like you. I told you. You're no match for me. Hello? You majored in business management. Tell me how to read a financial statement. What? What's this phone number? You have a friend on the finance team at Taesan Group, right? Contact everyone you can and find out about Taesan Group-- Do you know what time it is? Are you dreaming? Go to sleep. Stop babbling and go back to sleep. Sleep! Don't you dare hang up. You wake me up in the middle of the night and suddenly talk about financial statements and looking into Taesan Group? I'll introduce you to a pretty woman. I don't care! I have a crazy pretty woman right here. She's 39-24-36. It's been a while since I graduated. I can't remember... The redemption cost is the initial acquisition cost minus the appreciated depreciation. And times... To put it simply, there are two approaches. The economic approach and the accounting approach. The economic approach is... Simply put, you deduct from your assets little by little over time. That's a simple way of putting it. The accounting approach is a bit more difficult. You take the assets that you have... It's similar too. Okay. Okay. GL GROUP - 1.2 BILLION WON MOKHE SERVICE - 800 MILLION WON GLAVIX - 5 BILLION WON!! Glavix. Glavix. Remember. Glavix. Traders don't know this yet. There's a company named Glavix that went bankrupt two years ago. Another company acquired it and started mining six months ago. They're going to hit it big soon. It's a sure thing. If you have money, invest in that. Quickly. Babe. I'm only telling this to you. GLAVIX - 5 BILLION WON Hey, sleepyhead. You should wake up. You've slept enough. Wake up. Let's go kill them all. But before we kill them all, let's eat first. What's good around here? Aren't you eating? How can you fight a battle on an empty stomach? How did you come here? I came by plane. I took a taxi too. I came because I missed you. We don't have the leisure of saying hello and having fun. So, let's skip the hugs for now. There are a few problems I couldn't solve. You have to answer them. I can't bear to see you so weak and haggard. I can't ask my questions. Please eat something. Do you want to lose the resort? TOTAL NEEDED: 35 BILLION WON How did you-- You just have to come up with 35 billion won, right? That's it, right? Taesan invested five billion won in a company called Glavix. That company ceased R&D; and practically went bankrupt two years ago. Our shares are worthless now. That's what most people think. It hasn't been announced, but Glavix was acquired six months ago. The new company began mining. They found about three trillion won worth of gold and copper. As of this morning at 9:24 a.m., your worthless shares worth five billion won quadrupled to 20 billion won. Deduct 20 from 35, so you need 15 billion won more. Second. The Taesan chemical plant. The third plant is in Changwon, right? Aren't you going to pay attention? When did you find all this out? I have a huge network. Above all else, I am smarter than you can imagine. There's no end if I start to boast, so let's skip that. The chemical plant in Changwon. The third plant stopped operating over a year ago. Taesan doesn't seem to have any more plans to invest in chemicals. If you sold the plant, you could get at least 8.5 billion won at fair market value. And looking at footnote seven, it states that you will receive bonds next month. It's 5.98 billion won. That's a total of 34.48 billion won. You're smart as expected. You can get the remaining 520 million won by selling your watches, car, artwork, or whatever. I know you're awed and impressed. Let's skip those too. You don't have much time. I'll remember everything we skipped. Being awed, impressed, hearing you boast and a hug. Let's settle it all when I get back from winning. Where is Jae-hui? I'm heading there now. Tell her to stop everything she's doing and wait for me. Eun-gi. Win and kill them all. Don't come back if you don't win. ROLLING-TAESAN SIGNING CEREMONY Ms. Seo found a way to come up with the funds. Is she bluffing again? I don't think so. She asked you to stop everything and wait for her. Do I have to wait if Eun-gi tells me to wait, and stop if she tells me to stop? Is that what my position is? Will you wait if she says to wait, and stop if she says to stop? If you stop now, you'll have to keep stopping in the future. If you wait now, you'll have to keep waiting in the future. Would you hand me my robe? Contact the Rolling team and ask them to meet earlier. Ask them to come to the hotel as soon as possible. Tell them I'll get ready and rush over as well. Okay. I'll tell them that. Sorry, but can you go a little faster? Okay. - Sorry. - Okay. Hello, Ms. Seo. Say hello. This is Richard. He's Rolling's president. He'll be running the resort now. We just signed the contract. If you know a good man-- Didn't you get my message to stop everything you were doing? What? I'm sure you got my message. I found a way to come up with the funds without selling the resort. No. I never received any such message. You didn't tell her? I told Mr. Oh to relay the message to her. I heard, but I didn't tell Madam Han. Why not? I couldn't leave the future of Taesan Group to your personal feelings and lack of judgment. What was that? This resort was always criticized as lacking profitability. It should have been sold much sooner. We had to suffer losses because of your useless stubbornness. My useless stubbornness? Rolling offered a large amount for the purchase of this resort. Madam Han made it happen. It's a great opportunity for Taesan. We couldn't give that up. I know how you feel. Your mother personally planted each and every tree in this resort. She hand-selected every item that went into decorating each room. I understand that's why you're obsessed with this resort. But with business, you have to be objective and-- Cut the crap! Eun-gi! Seo Eun-gi! Get her out of here right now. Drag her out of here right now! I will not sell this resort. This resort will not be sold as long as I live. Shut up. Shut that mouth right now! You've lost your mind. The general director rips up a contract because of her personal feelings? A contract isn't a child's game! The company will reprimand you for this immature, outrageous, and irrational behavior. - Before that-- - I'll talk to my father. What did you just do? The chairman said when a child gets lost, doesn't know where to go, and does foolish things, acts out of line, or doesn't respond to reason, a parent must beat the child if necessary to set the child straight. - Look here, Jae-hui! - Watch what you call me. Don't call me "Jae-hui." I'm your mom. One more thing. Your father put me in charge of everything related to you. He said to scold the spoiled brat if necessary, and to beat you without holding back if necessary. One more thing. The person who wants to sell this resort the most is your father, not me. He wanted to erase every memory to your mom with this sale more than anyone else. You're lying. If you need confirmation, go ahead and ask him. Call him yourself and ask him. Get her out of here, so she can rest. Call the doctor and get her a sedative. Since when did you become Jae-hui's dog? You were one of the only two people I trusted at Taesan. What's most important to me are Taesan's well-being and profits. I only work for those two things. I guess you'll be successful. Although I don't know how long that success will last. Get your hands off of me. You're disgusting. I'm going to throw up. That looks like an expensive suit. I'm sure you don't want to ruin it. How did it go? I guess you lost. You didn't even get to pull out your knife, did you? I'll call you later. Is everyone there with you? Yes. Can I talk to Richard, the president of Rolling? Why? I have something to tell him. Put him on. Hold on. You can put me on speaker, right? Put me on speaker. The successor of Taesan should have looked further and at the big picture. You lost something greater over a profitless resort. I guess so. You made a huge mistake today. Maybe. You'll regret it. No. That, I will not do. Even if the chairman gets angry about this and takes everything from me because of this, at least I saved the resort. I'm satisfied with that. KANG MA-RU Are you still there? I'm here. Shall we meet? I didn't sleep much the past few days. My eyes keep closing. Let's meet after I get three hours of sleep. Okay, I'll see you in three hours. Have a nice nap. - Isn't it good? - Yes. You got some cream on your lip. Wipe it off for me. I'm sorry. You see, customers of all ages come here to our cafe. Excessive show of affection is prohibited. Wow. Should we get it to go? No, let's just eat here. Can I have something else? Of course. Order whatever you want. I make money to buy you yummy food. What would my Yu-ra like? A waffle or a sandwich? Young master? Young master. How have you been? - Do you know how worried the president is? - You must have the wrong person. Don't be like that. I know it's you. I'm telling you, you have the wrong person! If you look at me carefully in the sun, you'll see for sure that I'm not the person you're looking for. What was that? You come here on purpose, right? To piss me off. I do not. I come here because the food is really good. That's all. I like the giraffe that looks like Jae-gil too. - Bull... - Bull? Excuse me! Your employee is cursing at a customer. Hey, old lady! She called me an old lady, too. I'm a young, 26-year-old woman. Seriously! You look like you'll hit me. Excuse me! Your employee is trying to hit me. I am not! I didn't! I really didn't! Young master. Don't call me that. I removed myself from the family register years ago. Your father is old and weak. Please come back. You have to continue his work. Exploiting illegal alien workers, mistreating them and abusing them because they are powerless? And ignoring them and discarding them if they get hurt and become useless. You want me to take over for my dad and do that? Young master... If you see me again somewhere, please be sure to ignore me. I'll do the same. Oh. I changed my last name, too. I'm not Park Jae-gil. I'm Oh Jae-gil. Be sure to tell my father that. Tell him that if I could, I'd remove all of his blood flowing through my veins. I'm sorry. Did you wait long? No. Why did he call you "Young master"? And what's that about a president? Are you some sort of heir who ran away from home or something? What? No way. Me? Come on. He said he mistook me for someone who looks a lot like me. I see. What's wrong? What is that? What happened? Who did this? Hey! Choco! Are you a dog? Why did you bite her? Why would you bite a weak woman like her? I didn't bite her. I really didn't. Jae-gil. It hurts. When you were out, she bit her own arm in order to frame me-- I told you. I'm fine getting hurt, but I won't let anyone hurt her. I warned you! I told you I didn't bite her. I don't bite people! Why you! We'll talk about this at home. Ma-ru will beat you for two days, and I'll hit you one more time after that. One more thing. I wasn't going to say this, but she stole my bracelet too. Hey, old lady! It's a diamond bracelet worth over 1,000,000 won. She must be a kleptomaniac. This is such bull. I was going to call the police if she wasn't your friend's sister. - But-- - Call the police. Still. She's someone you know. I can't... Call the police now. We should send her to jail so that she can fix that bad habit. No, no. No. It's not that big a deal. There's no need for cops. Leave. You. He said to leave. Not Choco, you. Jae-gil. Go home. It's me, Yu-ra. Are you telling me to leave? Yes, you, Yu-ra. Go home. Jae-gil. Choco may draw on clothes with a marker, and she may step on your toe if she hates you. She may even bite your arm if she hates you. I wouldn't put it past her. But she would never steal. I know that. If you're going to lie, do it right. Who are you trying to frame? Get lost. Jae-gil. Get out of my sight, right now! I'm sorry. I was mistaken for a minute. If you don't go, I will. Wait! Hear me out! Jae-gil! The chairman is here. I heard you were ill. I'm always ill. Bring me some water in five minutes. Yes, sir. I heard the sale of the Aomori Resort fell through. Yes, sir. I was told our losses resulting from the sale falling through add up to 13 to 14 billion won. How should we punish the person who caused us so much damage? I don't think it's enough to fire her and kick her out of the house. Why don't you keep her at the house and the company, and make her pay it back from her salary and bonuses? It's not an amount she can pay back with her salary and bonuses. Then I'll throw in my salary and bonuses as well, if you don't fire her until she's 80. - Joon-ha. - Yes, sir. If by chance, everyone turns their backs on Eun-gi for some reason, and even if I turn my back on her as well, I hope you will... stay by her side. Even if everyone in the world leaves her, don't you leave her. Even if it's hard, be patient... and... protect her. Yes, sir. I will... do that. Mr. Park. You dropped this photo. - This is yours, right? - It is. Thank you. Actually. Have you seen him before? Pardon? Did he come to see Madam Han before? Oh, him. He didn't come to see her. However, he did leave an envelope for her in the mailbox. An envelope? When was that? I'll have to check the calendar to know for sure. So he did come to the house, right? Yes. Did he come any other time? He never came into the house. I don't know if he came to the gate and left like that time though. That's right. He could have come to the gate and met Madam Han outside. Excuse me? Nothing. Hi, Sairu. Do you know how to apply make-up? Hello? It's me, Jae-hui. You're in Japan, right? Where are you? I'll come to you. I have plans. Just give me ten minutes. I have something to tell you. I have nothing to listen to, nor do I want to. I want to see you. Give me just ten minutes. Hi, Ma-ru. I thought you may not come. You have ten minutes. Say what you wanted to say. Start now. Did I make you like this? That's right. I did this to you. You were the sweetest and warmest person in the world, but you've become such a cold, scary, and terrible person. I did this to you. A minute passed already. Shouldn't you get to the point? Let's take a boat ride. I want to get on a boat and go to the end of the ocean with you. Two minutes. We said we'd do that. You said you'd take me on a boat ride. That we'd go to the end of the world. That you wanted to go see what's at the end of the world together. You said that. You didn't keep that promise. Three minutes. Nine minutes. I wonder what's on the ocean floor. The bottom for me is the sewer filled with garbage. But you say even that's too good for me. Is the bottom of the ocean better than me too? Aren't you curious? I'd like to go in and see. Ten minutes. Ma-ru. I'm leaving. Don't go. Don't go. Please, don't go. Don't go to Eun-gi! Jae-hui. Jae-hui. Jae-hui! Jae-hui! The person you have reached is unavailable. I wasn't sure. But you... aren't over me, are you? That's why you've been lingering around me. You seem to be mistaken. Then why did you save me? I have nothing to do with you. I'm trash. The world is better off without me. You should have let me die. Why did you save me? I'll go back. I'll go back to you. Not now, but soon. I'll go back to you. So trust me and wait a little while. Just how low will you go? How far do you plan to fall? Is there no limit to how low you will fall? Ma-ru. You should have told me sooner. Before that childish and embarrassing test. Then... I might've been fooled and wavered. Ma-ru. Out of 100 memories, you trampled on 98 of them. Was that not enough? You should've left me at least two good memories. Yes. Then I wouldn't have thought that my first love was so deplorable. I wouldn't understand, but I could've forgiven you. Then I'd be less angry about wasting my life, thinking someone that low was my entire life. Shall we meet? I didn't sleep much the past few days. My eyes keep closing. Let's meet after I get three hours of sleep. Okay, I'll see you in three hours. What are you still doing here? What if I didn't come? Then I would have waited more. You're someone who'd come if I waited. Are you wearing make-up? I wore a dress for the first time, too. I couldn't even sit comfortably. It was so uncomfortable. We have some things to settle. What should we settle first? Your boasting, being impressed, awed, a hug. I seem crazy, don't I? It's because I'm in love. Get out of this house. Get out! Stop playing with Eun-gi and put her back where you found her. Her feelings seem sincere. Do my feelings seem insincere? I meant it when I said I'd go back to you. Are you kidding me? Should we just self destruct together? Ma-ru, you're driving me crazy. I can't stop thinking about you and missing you. He knew Madam Han for 19 years. He killed someone six years ago.
