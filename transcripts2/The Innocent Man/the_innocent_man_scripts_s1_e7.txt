 Thank you. - You look very pretty. - Thank you. KANG MA-RU Han Jae-hui speaking. Jae-hui. It's your big brother. It's been a while, baby sister. Where are you? Tell me what happened. Well... Jae-hui's thug brother got out of prison. He came over earlier, and demanded we tell him where Jae-hui is.

 He broke everything and hit Jae-gil. Forget it, Ma-ru. Just forget it, okay? He had a murderous look in his eyes. It looked like he would kill Jae-hui if he found her. Just stay out of it. If he comes here again, I'll deal with it. Just say you don't know anything, and don't do anything. Please. But he searched your room to find her phone number, and took your cell phone. Why did you tell him? Ma-ru loses his mind when it comes to Jae-sik.

 What if he does something? I totally lost my mind when I saw you getting beat up like that. I didn't think about my brother losing his mind. Choco. I've been meaning to talk to you for a while now. If you keep this up, I'll have to shave my head and become a monk. Huh? Why? It will be hard. I'm much better looking than your brother. Someone said I made women lose their breath. I don't deny it. That's true. But you can't be like this. It's impossible to control whom you like. Yes, I know that. It's beyond your control. I know that. - I know that, but-- - I know. I'm not good enough for you. Plus, you like voluptuous women. I'll just love you by myself. I won't get in your way. Let me crush on you alone. Okay? Why do I have to be so awesome? Give me your phone. Why? Are you calling your phone? Report it as being lost and forget about him. This isn't Jae-gil. It's Ma-ru. Where are you? I'll tell you where Jae-hui is. Let's meet. Give this to him for me. The studio down there is closing and opening a new business. The owner asked me to give this to him. Okay. Sure. Thank you. I relayed the picture to Ms. Seo. Shall we start with when you first met the chairman? Ms. Han? Ms. Han? Yes? What did you say? Did you take care of what you had to? Sort of. Are you going somewhere? Yes. I have to meet someone. Do you have something to say? No. I'll be back soon. You look terrible. We saw each other by the gate last night, didn't we? She's going to marry my father soon. I saw you on TV before. I remember you being a passionate reporter who criticized the injustices of society and said we shouldn't compromise when it came to ethics. You were like that? That was you, right? Han Jae-hui. Wow. You're impressive. You remember the name of a reporter who was on the news for a brief moment? I was a huge fan of hers. You have a fever. Of course, you're sick after drinking so much. What's going on between you and him? Who knows what he's like? Do you know him well? How much do you know about him? You don't know anything. You know nothing! And you do? Do you know him well? You'll be the one who's hurt. You'll be the one who cries, you fool. Let me take you to the hospital. You should get an IV. I don't need to go to the hospital. I just need some rest. Go ahead. I'll let you go. Okay. I'll pick up some medicine on my way back. See you later. OFFICIAL COMPLAINT CRIMINAL RECORDS CERTIFICATE KANG MA-RU ACCUSER HAN JAE-HUI The person who treated you on the plane was Kang Ma-ru. He knew Madam Han for 19 years. I think she paid him 1 billion won to keep him quiet about their relationship. Regardless, he approached you on purpose with an objective... Ma'am? You don't put sugar in your coffee. I'll get you a new cup. Keep going. Talk. How long has it been? Seven years? Eight? Have a seat. Sit down. Why didn't you come to visit me, you punk? I knew you were an ass, but still. I heard you went to prison, too. Hey. I heard you killed someone? You look like a total saint. I guess you never know with people. You're looking for Jae-hui? Where is she? She died six years ago. Don't look for her anymore. You punk-ass. You call that a joke? If you want, I'll let you join her. You can see whether or not it's a joke. Hey you. Peel that outside. Give me back my cell phone. You have her number stored on your phone. Thanks to that, I spoke with my dead sister. Jae-hui killed the person, right? Jae-hui killed the person and you took the fall for her. Right? You punk. You would never kill anyone. I know you. Jae-hui is perfectly capable though. He killed someone six years ago. It was manslaughter, but regardless, he served five years in prison for killing a person. He was expelled from his college because of that. What else? Pardon? Don't you have anything more to tattle about him? Isn't what you heard enough? So? What about it? - Ma'am. - What about it? He had a serious relationship with Madam Han for a long time. You already told me that. He approached you to get revenge against Madam Han. Are you a moron? You already told me that, too. - Ma'am. - That's all, right? You're freaking out about nothing. What should I do with him? I'll look up some laws if you want to take legal action. Don't you dare touch him. Ma'am. Do not touch a single hair on his body. Ma-ru. Do you like Jae-hui that much? Even after she ruined your life, you still want to take her side? Do you like that devil that much? I can't understand any of the bull you're spewing out. You got out of prison after eight years. You should just shut up and live in hiding for everyone's sake. This isn't a suggestion. It's a warning. Ma-ru. I'll get revenge for you, too. She used you when she needed you, and then she abandoned you, that bitch. I can't explain everything in detail, but that bitch is evil to the core. I can't even compare. I'll get revenge for me, my mom, and even for you. I'll get revenge for all of us. You pay for this. Just tell me where Jae-hui is. I heard she became the mistress of the chairman of Taesan Group. But that's nonsense. You punk. You shouldn't glare at me like you want to kill me or something. We're on the same side. Jae-hui that bitch ruined both our lives. You should be helping me. You'd better not go near her. - I'll kill you too. - Why you... I'm not the same person you knew. I don't know what that stupid brain of yours is imagining, but I really killed someone. I already have blood on my hands. Do you think I can't kill again? Please keep your promise, sir. The union members stopped their strike at 4:00 p.m. Please call Ms. Seo back home and reinstate her at the company. I said she should stop the strike, not to give all her money away. You only specified that she had two days. You never dictated how she must go about it. She did the best she could do. I don't want to hear it. Leave. If you will not keep your promise, I will resign as of today. I don't want to work for someone who doesn't keep his word. Is that a threat? I'll submit my resignation in the morning. Joon-ha. If you leave her like this, she may not even make an effort to come back. She may give up on everything completely. What do you mean? I'm saying she may find something better and more important outside of the fence you raised. And being your successor at Taesan may become meaningless and lame to her if you leave her like this. Explain so I can understand. I think... Eun-gi has lost her mind. What if I want something else? What if it's not a stupid watch that I want, but you, who can buy 100 of those watches without batting an eye? What then? There is a mountain that I really want to climb, so I desperately need a ladder right now. I feel like you could be the perfect ladder for me. What will you do if I try to seduce you? - Excuse me. - Yes? - Give me ten cans of beer. - Sure. Jae-hui. It's your big brother. HAN JAE-HUI - Hello? - Dirty bastard. You want to use my brother, too? Fine. Go ahead. Do whatever you want. Let's see how far you and I can go. Let's do this. Madam. The chairman is asking for you. Okay. Do you feel ill again? No. I just don't feel too great, that's all. You wanted to see me? Go and get Eun-gi. - Pardon? - If a daughter leaves home, shouldn't the mother be worried, and search all corners of the earth to find her? Yes. I was going to go tomorrow-- {\an8}She's at that man's house from last time, apparently. KANG MA-RU 4314-5 JEONGNEUNG-DONG, JONGNO-GU I thought I told you to get rid of him. He isn't that easy. We can't underestimate him. Eun-gi won't listen to me either. He can't be convinced with money? He looked like he wouldn't give up even if you gave him your entire fortune. Have him locked up for blackmail. The public may find out if we aren't careful. Are you saying there's no way? Am I to just sit around and watch? Go to that punk's home and bring Eun-gi home right now. Yes, sir. The muscle that Mr. Jang knows... We can trust them, right? Hey. You there, walking ahead of me. Good looking man! Wow. What a narcissist. You think you're good looking? What are you doing out here? I had to go somewhere, too. Let's have a drink. I found a nice spot for drinking. Do you have a death wish? You're in no condition to drink. Forget it then. I'll drink all this by myself. I won't be responsible if you die. Drink just this much today. Two-thirds of what you drank last night will still be in your body. Don't worry, you can still die. Look at all those lights. Are there that many people in Seoul? Do you know what the population is? It's over ten million. How many do you think are men and how many are women? I don't know. Of those lights, among the men and women, there must be my future husband and your future wife, right? Be sure to send me an invitation when you get married. I don't know if I'll be able to go, but I'll be sure to send a gift. What's with that look? You didn't expect to marry me, did you? That would be too much. There are trees you can't climb and those you can't even dream of. You know how to differentiate, don't you? Do you understand what I'm saying? I do. It's a good thing you're smart. Among the men I met in the past was an imbecile who was clueless and got me sick of him. May I ask why you're suddenly doing this? It's not sudden. It was my plan from the start. I fell in love with you because my life sucked so much at the time. It was just a moment of passion, and all moments come to an end. It will end soon anyway. I wanted to see how crazy I could get about this unique and amusing guy. I left myself to that passion. I thought it would end in a month at most, but my feelings lasted longer than I had expected. That was a compliment. You must be flabbergasted. I'm unbelievable, right? You must be pissed off as hell. You want to strangle me, don't you? I'm sure this could suck like hell for you right now. It must be hard to accept or understand. Not at all. I understand. You... understand? You want to end it, right? Fine, let's end it. It's a good thing you have a lot of pride. I was worried that you'd latch on and whine and beg like a loser. I didn't know how I'd walk all the way up there at this hour. I'm glad I ran into you. I came to get you. Let's go home, Eun-gi. Eun-gi. Eun-gi, wake up. Eun-gi! Kang Ma-ru. The muscle that Mr. Jang knows... We can trust them, right? No. They don't have to get involved yet. Bring Eun-gi home first. Let's think of a way slowly. Get up, you bastard. Hello? It's been a while, Mr. Kang Ma-ru. I was going to talk to you over a nice meal, but it didn't work out. That's too bad. Those men will hand you an envelope. It's a contract for a 10-story building, farm, and house in California. There's also an oath promising you'll never see our child again. Sign the contract and the oath and send them with those men. Then the building, farm, and house will be yours immediately. There's a plane ticket in there as well, so that you can leave as soon as tomorrow. There's one for your sister, too. The chairman's love for his daughter is unparalleled. He is being very thoughtful. If you refuse yet again, someone you love most may get hurt next time. This is a fight you'll lose inevitably. Stop being stubborn and sign them. Please press one to leave a voicemail. Press two to send a page. Ma-ru. Why did you turn your phone off? I'm worried. How are you feeling? Did you go to the hospital? I arrived safely in Anmyeondo with Choco. She doesn't know you were beaten up so badly, so don't worry about her. I'll keep her with me until you're completely healed, as you asked. Jae-gil. Did you sleep well? Was the bed comfortable? Do you like the room? Are you terminally ill? What? They say people change when they're terminally ill. Why are you being so nice? What did I do? You came to my work last night out of the blue and asked me to go on a trip with you. I thought it was my lucky day, and came before you changed your mind. But when I woke up this morning, something felt wrong. You're too sensitive. The air quality in Seoul has been terrible lately, so I wanted some good quality air. - I want to go home. - No! You can't go home. We have to stay here with me for a while. Don't think about anything. Especially not your brother. Don't even call him. Just look at me. Just think about me. Just play with me. Aren't you afraid of me? Why should I be? Are you a ghost? No, but I... Never mind. You'll hit me if I tell you. I won't hit you. I won't, so tell me. I might... jump you. What? What are you saying? If we're alone, I may try something and jump you. You? Jump me? Yeah. How? When I brought you home that night when you were drunk, I gave you a kiss on the forehead. Bad! You brat... You're just a kid! That hurt! See? I said you'd hit me! I'm going home. Let me make this clear. You and I are like brother and sister. And more importantly, you're not my type. That's why I want to go to Seoul! I'm going to my brother! Choco. Hello. Heat this up for Ms. Seo when she starts eating. I will. Thank you. She's getting an IV and just fell asleep. She can't have visitors for a while. The chairman wanted to see me urgently. That's why I'm here. Did you know? Does that mean... you knew already? Why didn't you tell me? Are you with those rats? I was afraid you'd be shocked and fall ill. That's why I didn't tell you. Ms. Seo instructed me not to tell you as well. Even Eun-gi knows? Yes, sir. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. Sir. Sir. Don't let on... that we know. Don't let Eun-gi know... that I know either. I want you to come up with a strategy. Look into every single law that you know, and find every crime we can press charges for. If not, frame them for everything and anything possible. Make sure that Min-yeong and Jae-hui, those despicable degenerates, rot in prison for at least 30 years. I won't be able to die in peace until then. That's the only way for me... to leave Eun-gi to you... and rest in peace. We're in trouble. This morning, the chairman requested the surveillance videos from outside of his house. But... The videos... The videos... What about the videos? I think you and Madam Han were caught on those videos. So? Why is that a problem? Where are the videos? The chairman has them already. I heard he checked the videos once a month through Mr. Jang, without anyone knowing. I think... Mr. Park saw the videos much earlier. Choco. Ma-ru. I made you some beef soup. Eat it while it's still hot. Are they out? Choco. Ma-ru. Jae-gil. Choco! Ma-ru! Jae-gil! Where did they go with the gate wide open? His shoes are there. I'm sure they'll eat it when they want if I leave it here. {\an8}KANG MA-RU You want to end it, right? Fine, let's end it. You seem to be getting worse. Go to the hospital first thing in the morning. Okay. So... anything else? Goodbye. Take care. Wow. He's so hot. How could he look hot even if he sleeps with his mouth open? Scratching like that will ruin his skin. - What did you do? - I didn't do anything. You were... You were holding my hands! That's because you were scratching your face. I mean it. I didn't do anything. I didn't jump you. I don't have a death wish. You should just read or something. Why did you come down? What's that? You packed your things? I'm going to Seoul. You can sleep comfortably in the bedroom. Bye. I told you. You have to stay here with me for a while. Ma-ru's phone has been turned off since yesterday. I'm worried that something is wrong. I want to go home. - He went away with a woman. - What? He turned off his phone and went to Hong Kong, Taiwan, somewhere, with a woman. You're full of it. He never turns off his phone in case I faint somewhere. What? He knows you're with me. Besides, every time you fainted on the streets, I'm the one who ran over, not him. You're right. That's true. You were always by my side whenever I was sick. See? You were always so cool. You did such lovable things, but you tell me not to love you. What am I supposed to do? Get pissed off and go crazy? You're right. That's my fault. I won't come running anymore, even if you die. I lied yesterday. About giving you a kiss on the forehead. Right? You wouldn't do that to me. I'd kill you. It wasn't just "a kiss." It was three. Bad! You little brat. You're still a kid. That hurt more than yesterday's! I ought to... Ma-ru's phone is turned off today, too? Are you going somewhere? I have to go to work. You can't go. You can't step foot outside of this room until the chairman gives permission. He told me to keep you home for a while and not let you go out. He hired a guard to watch you 24 hours a day as well. You can't go anywhere. - Listen. - Look outside if you don't believe me. You should eat. You're sick. You didn't eat anything for a few days. What did you do to him? - Who? - Kang Ma-ru. You sent muscle to threaten him. Like a lowlife scumbag. You knew I was listening to everything. Sure. It didn't matter whether or not you heard. I sent gangsters to beat him and threaten him, and tried to pay him off like a lowlife because of you. What was the result? You can end it. There isn't anything the chairman can't do if he sets his mind to it. End it before something worse happens. If you end it, it'll all be over. He didn't fall for it. Even with such a lowlife scumbag threat, assault, and money. I guess I'm a good judge of character. Get some rest. - Hello? - Jae-hui. It's me, your big brother. It's Jae-sik. Should I come to you? What do you want? Is that how you greet your brother you haven't seen in eight years? I don't want anything. I just want to see my pretty sister's face. Too bad. I don't want to see your face in the slightest. I'm busy. I have to go. Does that confidence come from Ma-ru? You sure raised a loyal dog. He threatened to tear out my limbs if I went near you. He totally lost his mind. He said he already had blood on his hands and could kill again. He changed completely since he killed a person. You seem to be mistaken. Believe me. I really... love you, Jae-hui. You know blood is thicker than water. Even if that punk Ma-ru will do absolutely anything for you, I'm your blood. He couldn't love you more than I do. Don't tell him I called, okay? Let's meet somewhere quiet and shoot the breeze and talk about the past. This brat hung up again. Win and kill them all. Don't come back if you don't win. You crapped out. You're screwed now, by the jerk Kang Ma-ru. Do you want to run away? Get up, put your shoes on and run away from me with all your strength. This is your only chance. Ma-ru! Ma-ru! Ma-ru! Ma-ru! Ma-ru! Ma-ru! Ma-ru! That... was my first kiss. The kiss with you in Hirosaki. It was the first time I ever told anyone that I loved them. The first time in the 29 years that I've lived. "I love you, Eun-gi." That was the first heart-fluttering profession of love I had ever heard. Thanks to you. Thanks to a man named Kang Ma-ru, I'm happy to be alive... and to breathe... for the first time ever. Now, my only wish right now... is to see you every day, tell you I love you every day, hear you tell me you love me every day, share the same dream with you, have a child and raise the child together... and just grow old together. Is that possible? Let's take a trip here. Our first trip just by ourselves. Ma-ru, help me. My brother is going to kill me. Help me just this once. The chairman drew his sword. He's going to leave everything to Eun-gi. I didn't think you'd come. Did you grow to love Eun-gi? I regret getting her involved.
