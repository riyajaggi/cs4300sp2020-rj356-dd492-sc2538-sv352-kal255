 golf courses or beauty salons. No life of leisure. The only thing she enjoys is going off-roading on her bike. Do you want to go with me? Look. Madam Han is a very busy person. She has a child waiting at home. Sure. She should go home. She should. Thank you for coming. I'm sorry you had to come when you are busy, but it's protocol, so we had no choice. Please be understanding. May I ask a question? What is your world like? What's the world you live in like, that you make normal people bow down, feel insignificant, lose their minds, and give up on being human beings? Why, you little punk. You didn't answer a single question. What bull are you spewing out? If I explained it to you, could you understand? It's blindingly bright, breathtakingly beautiful and luxurious like a dream. Could someone like you possibly even imagine it if I told you? My bike... My bike! What are you doing? My bike. You want to go down there to get your bike in your condition? Let go! Let go of me! Is your goal suicide? You can just buy another bike. My doll. It's on my bike. My doll is on my bike! You need a doctor. I think your brain is broken. Mom! Mom. What's on your bike? I'll get it for you. Did you say it was a doll? EMERGENCY CARE UNIT He got caught on a branch. That probably saved his life. Although he broke his ribs, he's young, so they will heal naturally in time. What did you say your relationship was with him? I don't know him. Do you... know me? Have we met before? You don't know me. We've never met. And yet, you did something that crazy in that crazy situation. Whom were you planning to blame if something went wrong? Is that how your parents taught you? That if you're grateful or sorry, you should get mad, throw a fit, be unreasonable, and dump it on the other person? If you're grateful, just say thank you. If you're sorry, say you're sorry. My parents may have been illiterate and ignorant, but they taught me that much. Forget it. You didn't push me. I did it purely on my own volition. Thus, there's no reason for us to meet again. I have no reason to blame you or extort you, so don't worry about it. There, that's it. Will you leave now? I need to rest. Why? Why? Why would you do that for me? That's why people say you're a clueless little girl who doesn't know anything. How long do I have to wait for you? How long do I have to wait, you stupid fool? I can't give Taesan to someone who can't protect it. There are other alternatives. There are Jae-hui and Eun-seok, too. Mommy. My son. He said we were alternatives, too. He said he'd give us a chance, too. Huh? What? You should have it all. The world Mommy never imagined. The world I couldn't imagine. Don't get pushed out. Don't get kicked out. Don't let anyone else take anything from you. You take it all. Okay, son? Hey, Yeong-bae. Can we meet? - Are you busy these days? - A bit. Why did you want to see me? I heard Joon-ha gave you a secret task. - Sorry? What do you... - I hear you're digging into the relationship between Madam Han and that blackmailer. I guess you're not done yet. You seem to be mistaken. If that's why you wanted to see me, I should get going. I'm thinking of throwing you a lifeline right now. You decide whether to grab it or not. That's totally up to you. But you'll never get a chance like this again. I don't quite understand what you're referring to. Okay, then. You may go. The two of them were dating. Up until Madam Han moved into the chairman's house, Madam Han was in a very serious relationship with Kang Ma-ru. They grew up in the same neighborhood. They had maintained a special relationship since childhood. I confirmed it with the residents. Does Joon-ha know this? Is that true? There wasn't any relationship at all between Madam Han and that man. Really? I heard they seemed to know each other on the plane. I met with the flight attendant who said that, and she said she was probably mistaken because things were so frantic. Are you continuing with his background check? He attended a medical college but dropped out and is a bartender now. His only family is a sick younger sister, but there's nothing else. Do you have a picture of him? I do. Something is suspicious. He isn't a blackmailer who was after a billion won. He could never. Will you leave now? I need to rest. Are you all right? Tell me if you're in pain. I'll give you a painkiller. KANG MA-RU RIB FRACTURE AND BRUISE KANG MA-RU Yes, Dr. Kim. Yes. Okay. I will let them know. Okay. That was Dr. Kim. Your donor suitability test results are back. He says a transplant is possible. Ms. Seo. What did you say? The donor suitability test results are back. A transplant is possible. What is he talking about? What donor suitability test? What transplant? I was told the only way to treat your illness was a transplant. The best way is to find a donor among family or relatives. We should set a date for the operation. I don't have much scheduled for the next two weeks. We can schedule it around your calendar. You immature child. How much do I have to teach you for your brain to function properly? That goes for you too, Min-yeong. If a thoughtless immature kid acts immature, you should stop her. You want to endanger the future of Taesan to extend my life a couple of years? - But Mr. Chairman... - Forget it. You can't even take care of your own health. Why are you worrying about me? Give me a break. I'm healthy now. Dr. Kim said I was healthy enough for the transplant. Your father's right. Listen to him. Your body isn't just yours now. You have to be responsible for the lives of millions of people, including Taesung's employees and their families. In the far future, when the chairman has passed on, and everyone else here is gone, you're the only person who can protect and lead Taehan. You have to cherish your body more and take good care of it. As for your father... As for the chairman... I was going to tell you anyway. I was recently tested to be a donor as well. I was told I was an optimum match to be your donor. How fortunate. It doesn't matter what happens to me. Life without you has no meaning for me anyway. Let's leave the future of Taesan safe. I'll be your donor. Please let me. Wasn't the steak good today? It tastes much better since we got a new chef, doesn't it? About the Busan shopping mall that we're signing next month... Yes, sir. Put it in her name. In Jae-hui's name. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, my heart isn't that cheap. It can't be compensated with a little shopping mall. If you're doing this because you want to compensate me because I offered to be your donor, all of Taesan will still not be enough. What I'm offering to do is something that is easy for a wife to do for her husband, for family to do for family. You and I are family. I know no one accepts that, and no one accepts me, but in my heart, I was always your family and the mother of your child. Everyone wanted to ignore me and pretend I didn't exist, but that's how I always felt... by myself. Don't do it. Don't think about giving me anything. Please. - Min-yeong. - Yes, sir. Did you know? That everyone ignored her, pretended like she didn't exist, and didn't accept her? No, sir. How could I dare... I did not, sir. I guess you're the only one who didn't know. Even I knew for a long time. How do I get people to stop acting like she doesn't exist and ignoring her, and let the world know that she's my family, the mother of my child, and my wife? What's the best way to let people know? Before I die. They're getting married? They're having a wedding? My dad and Jae-hui? Yes. He wants to have a legal wedding and put out a press release. He gave the order to make preparations. How many guests should we invite? I was in the middle of something. I'll call you back. Do you remember this doll? You played with it all the time and would never let it go when you were little. When your dad threw all your dolls away, I hid this one - and kept it-- - I don't remember. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. I always felt bad about that. I wish you could just wear pretty clothes and pretty shoes like this doll, meet a nice man who cares about you, and live like other ordinary girls your age. That's still how I want you to live. Do you want to go with me? Do you want to leave this house with me? This place will suffocate you and kill you-- Even I suffocate to death, I'm going to die here right where I belong. I'm going to stay. Eun-gi. Wear pretty clothes, pretty shoes, and meet a nice man? Like this doll? I'm going to survive and win. I'm going to win and crush them all! I will never live like you. I won't run away, hide, and live like a loser. I, Seo Eun-gi, will never live like that! Where did you get this doll? He gave it to me. Kang Ma-ru. I went to the hospital. He told me to give it to you. Also, he politely refused the gift that you had sent. Excuse me. Where did this patient go? He was discharged about an hour ago. The hospital has his address, right? Ma-ru, I came to see Mom. The one who gave birth to me. I'm going to stay here. Don't worry about me anymore. Stop doing bad things because of my medical bills. Thank you for raising me. Stay healthy. Bye. The person you have reached is unavailable. Madam. - Who is it? - And who are you? - Jae-gil. - Yes. - Get up. - What? Ma-ru. Hey. Where have you been? You didn't answer your phone and kept texting you were okay. Were you with a woman? Aren't you hot? You'll get a heat rash. He's gorgeous. It's all from plastic surgery. He's all plastic. He got plastic surgery? He even replaced his teeth. I heard he even rearranged his bones. Wow. How did he look before? Something like this. The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave a message after the tone. You didn't get anything done? Come on, now. What's there to change? People say I'm God's masterpiece. What about you? You got work done, didn't you? I did not. I'm all natural. No surgery or make-up. I look like a celebrity with even a little make-up, so I don't even wear BB cream. What's this then? I guess I found the right address. Are you here for me? I never knew there was a neighborhood like this in Seoul. My feet hurt. Had I known it was like this, I would've worn hiking shoes. Do these houses have building permits? Is this different from shantytowns that don't require permits? Cars can't come up here. How do you get around when it snows and gets icy? You burn coal briquettes for heat in the winter, don't you? Did I say something wrong? Did I offend you? I'm sorry if I did. I wasn't thinking. I was worried and intrigued. Are you interested in me? - What? - You're exaggerating and being rude to hide your feelings. - Hey. - Are you moved easily? - Listen. - Someone good-looking is your dream guy? You think way too highly of yourself and are seriously mistaken. The reason I came to this ridiculous slum to see you is-- I told you it wasn't your fault, that I acted purely on my own volition, and that we have no reason to see each other again. That's your position, not mine. My position is completely different. I can't stand being indebted to another person. Let me write off that debt for you. We're even. - Choco. - What's wrong with my life? Why does my life suck so much? What kind of a mom is she? I came to her after 20 years. Why is my mom like this? Give it to me! Where's the safe? You took every penny yesterday! I called the police! I told them - to arrest you for gambling and assault! - You bitch! Come here. - Choco! - You bitch! The person you have reached is unavailable. Did your great parents teach you to be that rude? Did they teach you not to listen to others, and to interpret and decide things however you want? - Get out. - After I was treated like this? No. - I'm not done. - I have to go somewhere urgently. Go. If you're in such a rush, we can talk on the way. You're so conceited. You're a total douchebag. I don't get scared easily. - I'll drop you off at the next-- - I haven't even begun talking. This car may not return to Seoul today. That threat isn't very novel or all that intimidating. I won't even stop at a rest area. Get out while you can. Don't regret it later. We can talk until we arrive, right? Didn't you hear that I refused it? I did. But why did you refuse it? Why won't you accept it? You don't seem like such a saint. Regardless, you almost died because of me. If you don't care, that's fine, but I need to compensate you. I get it now. Is it cash you want? Hey. I offered you a deal. What if I want something else? What if it's not a stupid watch that I want, but you, who can buy 100 of those watches without batting an eye? What then? There is a mountain that I really want to climb, so I desperately need a ladder right now. I feel like you could be the perfect ladder for me. What will you do if I try to seduce you? You should go back to the hospital. I don't think it's your ribs that you injured, but your brain. I plan to, actually. My taste in women dropped since the accident. I was slightly excited when I saw you earlier. I didn't even look at women like you before the accident. Please stop the car. I told you. I won't even stop at a rest area until I get there. Don't glare at me like that. My dream girl also changed since the accident. A mean woman with a nasty temper who can kill people with her glare. Where is your destination? How much longer do we have to go? Walk ten minutes that way and you'll hit a bus terminal. If you don't like buses, there will be a bunch of cabs Goodbye. When we meet again, I'm going to seduce you, so put your guard up. - Thank you. - Thank you. Goodbye. Where is your daughter? Where is your daughter? Choco? Why? Where is that chocolate or biscuit, whatever her name is? Do you know where I'm coming from because of your daughter? That bitch called the cops on me for gambling and assault. I was at the police station! That's where I'm coming from! That's because she felt bad that her mom was being beaten so much. I beat you? Did you say I beat you? How dare you try to frame an angel like me? When did I beat you? Give me proof! When did I hit you? This is so unfair. Dear god! Seriously! - Stop it. - Now what? You little... I said to stop. If I go crazy, I may beat the crap out of you. What? You asshole. Go ahead and try. Just try! - Are you all right? - Who is this asshole? Did you bring him? Did you? Honey. Help! Help! Sun-ja! Ma-ru! Don't hit him! Don't hit him! He's my brother! He's my brother! Ma-ru. Shouldn't you go to the hospital? It's one incident after another with you. Your ribs haven't even healed yet. - You haven't left yet? - I was watching your fight. You looked cool, going up against two people. If it weren't for Ma-ru, that jerk would have beaten you to death. He just has a loud voice. He has a weak punch. It gives me bruises, but it doesn't hurt, to be honest. Oh, boy. - Here, eat. - No. Eat. No. I don't want to. Where's your brother? Take Choco with you. Mom! I said I was going to live here. He lived a tough life because of me. May I take her? May I take Choco home? No. I won't go. You abandoned me for 20 years. Take responsibility now. I'm always sick and suck the life out of my poor brother. - You should take care of me now. - Choco! To be honest, I don't think I can handle her. I'm not comfortable enough to, and I don't have money. My husband's gotten more violent since she came, too. Mom! If I have to choose between you and him, I'll choose him. I can't live without him. Mom. We lived together for 20 years, through thick and thin. I'm sorry, but to be honest, I don't have much affection for you. I dumped a newborn on your brother 20 years ago and forgot all about you, to be honest. It wasn't like your dad and I had you out of love. Pack your things right now. Go get your things. I can't believe it. What kind of a mom is this? So go live with your brother. It's not like he's a stranger! You have different moms, but you have the same dad. You took care of her for 20 years. Take care of her to the end! - Take-- - Didn't you hear me? I said to get your things! If Choco gets married later on... Call me if she ever gets married-- I will not call you. Ever. Who are you? She's someone I know. Hello. Is she your girlfriend? No, just someone I know. Put your seatbelt on. MADAM HAN Isn't there something you want to ask me? Oh. You're omniscient, so you may know everything already. You like wine, right? I lived in that neighborhood for 25 years. My mom was a prostitute and I don't know who my dad is. My older brother was a gambling addict and gangster. My mom and my brother tried to sell me to a brothel any chance they got. For money. I don't know where rock bottom is, but I lived in that sewer like a cockroach for 25 years. But... that kid helped me survive. Ma-ru. The person you already checked out. I loved him more than life itself at one point in time. Kang Ma-ru. He was like home to me. The light was always on and it was always warm and inviting. He protected me from all the dangerous and scary things in the world. My home. He believed in me no matter what I did. He was the only person on my side. And yet, I betrayed him. I... killed someone, and Ma-ru... took the fall for me. His life was ruined because of that, but... I found myself strangling him again just so I could survive. It's so nice being high up like this. It's so fancy and blinding. It all feels like a dream, so I pinch myself countless times a day. I want to stay here for a long time. If this is a dream, I don't want to wake up until I die. Help me. Should I get you some medicine? I'm all right. I'm not drunk. You should have drunk with me. You made me drink the whole bottle by myself. Goodbye. Do you trust me? Why do you trust me? I've served the chairman for 25 years. He is like my savior to me. He trusts me more than his own family. If I... - tell him everything-- - You won't. Why do you think I won't? Because you like me. Because you've loved me for a very long time, way before the chairman did. Tell him if you want. It's up to you. You're home. Wake up. Did I fall asleep? I must have. I can't believe I slept in someone else's car. Thank you. That's what I should say, right? I'm leaving. Let's meet again, you and I. I'm suddenly curious about you. Let's meet again, you and I. Tomorrow and the day after. Did I tell you I'm going crazy because I like you? - You did. - He's the man I'm dating. Do you want money? You only live once. You can live a posh life, too! Let's go kill them all. Jae-hui wouldn't betray me, right? You've gone insane. That's why I plan to bring you back.
