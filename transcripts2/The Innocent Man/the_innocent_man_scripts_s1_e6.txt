 I'm Ma-ru. Kang Ma-ru. I'm Jae-hui. Han Jae-hui. I know. You're the prettiest girl in town. To be precise, all my dreams came true that day. Just hearing the name Jae-hui made my heart flutter, and there she was, smiling at me. Why don't you date her then?

 Do you have an inferiority complex? Sure, you're dirt poor compared to that conglomerate family, but you're a good catch when you set all that aside. She would've struck gold. Can't you be the one to strike gold? Unless you don't want to. I do. I do! A man never goes back on his word. You can't change your mind. You'll burn in hell if you betray me. - I got greedier and had another dream. - You can't goes back on your word. I still

 can't believe that you came to me. Thank you for coming to me. I'm confident. I can't give you great wealth and honor, but I will cherish you and love you with everything I have. I won't let you be lonely. I won't leave you alone. I'll hold your hand and I won't let go no matter what. I will always stand by you so that you can always find me. My beginning was you. I promise you will be my end too. I hope you feel that way, too. June 30, 2003. From Ma-ru. - I seem like a lunatic, don't I? - You do not, ma'am. Like hell, I don't. All I need is a straight jacket. It's because I'm in love. I can't believe love can make a person so weak and nonsensical. I'm in shock myself. What was that I had before? I thought that was love, too. Is it that man from the other day? The one who pissed off the chairman... I need to buy some new clothes. Like some dresses and skirts instead of pantsuits. Something that looks really feminine and sexy. Where can I learn how to apply make-up? Ms. Kim in the secretaries' office does make-up well. Can you get her to teach me? Come on, now. Stop being so surprised. I told you. Seo Eun-gi is a complete lunatic right now. Don't tell anyone. If the chairman finds out, he may really put me in a straight jacket and send me to an asylum. Ms. Seo. This is a sedative. I'm Seo Eun-gi. I didn't eat a single meal today. He could at least feed me before kicking me out. Give me something to eat. How can you eat right now? I have to give Eun-seok a bath. I know you're brazen and shameless, but how can you eat after causing the company such a great loss? I was only going to eat a little and then leave. There isn't any food for you in this house. Get out of this house right now. Is that all I have to do? Leave? Your credit cards, car, and the hotel... You can't use anything paid for by Taesan Group. Joon-ha. Confiscate her credit cards and car keys. Call the hotel and tell them not to let her step foot in the hotel. And you. Don't inconvenience or ask for a penny from Joon-ha, Ms. Hyun, or anyone being paid by Taesan. Don't even think about it. - Sir. - Is there... anything else? You don't have to come to work. If I let someone like you stay at the company a day longer, you'll try to ruin it-- Don't you... Don't you have... the slightest inclination to compliment me for saving the resort? Those crooks would've destroyed it and left nothing behind. The resort that your wife left you as a final gift. Aren't you proud of your daughter for saving it? Are you not willing to compliment me at all? The financial loss we suffered from the deal falling through is exactly 13.35 billion won, right? I was going to press charges against you, but Jae-hui barely stopped me. You caught one. You're so good at catching fish. Do you want the ball? Get out right this instant! Sir. She had good intentions. Can't you forgive her and-- She didn't admit that she was foolish and ask for forgiveness She hasn't said anything of the kind. She still doesn't know what she did wrong. What's there to forgive? Ma'am. Saving the Aomori Resort is the best and wisest thing I ever did in my entire life. If the same situation occurred again, I would make the same choice. - Ma'am. - Get out! Since everything in these suitcases were paid for by Taesan, I'll leave them all here. I'd like to take off the clothes I'm wearing, but I can't walk around naked. Take care of your health, Mr. Chairman. Ma'am. Ma'am. Eun-gi. Didn't you hear what he just said? I can't cause any inconvenience or ask for money from anyone employed by Taesan-- I'm not giving this to you as Taesan's lawyer. I'm giving it to you as your friend who knew you since you started to crawl. Take it. It's all right. You're a Taesan person regardless. I don't want to cheat. Confiscate these. My car keys are in my room. I'm going to have to embezzle this. Will you really just leave? What can I do? He thinks I'm pure evil, who caused the company a great loss. Please take good care of him. Can I ask you something? Yes, ma'am. Where can I catch the bus? - All done. - All done. You look incredibly handsome today. You look like a chairman. You're the best. Why did you turn it off? Why are you so excited? I'm excited. I'm super excited. I'm excited about everything. Leessang is recruiting choreographers. Should I apply? You should apply with me. They're nice people. They pay a lot. You miss Yu-ra, don't you? Yu-ra? Who's that? I know Yuri of Girls' Generation. Who is Yu-ra? Jae-gil! Who is it? Oh, you're the girl who came to Jumunjin. Hi. Hello. Is your brother home? He went to work. I see. Can you tell me where he works? What's the liquor Van Gogh drank often before eventually cutting his ear off? That's right. Absinthe. Give me a glass of that. I rented out the whole bar. We'll be the only ones here today. A glass of absinthe. You still look great no matter where you are or what you do. It's no wonder the ice-cold Eun-gi melted. Stop playing with her now, and put her back where you found her. She's a poor soul. She already has me stepping on her. You don't need to add to it. She tries hard to put up a facade that she's really strong, but she's no match for me. How can a person who has a lot to lose beat someone who has nothing to lose? I don't care if you waste money, but please act drunk at home. I meant it when I said I'd go back to you. I too haven't gotten over you. A woman named Seo Eun-gi is going to the bar. If you're with other women, get rid of them in ten minutes. You could have just told me the address. I had to go there anyway. I work there, too. I'm a singer. I see. Want an autograph? Hi, Ma-ru. SEO EUN-GI You're coming here? Yes, I should be there soon. I'm glad. I miss you like crazy. I got kicked out. I thought you would. I cleaned my room. You can live with me in my room. I'm hungry. What do you want to eat? If it's something I can make, I'll cook for you. Ramen, fried dumplings, and tteokbokki. I like your appetite. I'll make it at the speed of light, so get here as quickly as possible. I love you. I love you! Me too. I love you too, Eun-gi. My girlfriend is coming over. We're closed for the day. How far do you plan to go? She seems completely sincere about you. She doesn't know anything. Stop using her. Do I seem completely insincere? I'm an ordinary man with a brain and a heart. She's from a rich family. She's young, smart, and pretty. And she's lovable, too. Do you think my feelings are completely insincere? How much farther is it? We're almost there. It's just around that corner. Do you want an autograph? Sure. You should go. You know the way out. She should be here soon. I'm sure you don't want to run into her. It would put you in a bind, too. Should we just self destruct together? Should we, Ma-ru? This would be the best pose for when Eun-gi walks in. She'll know right away exactly what the situation is, and how she was being used. I don't want to bother explaining. Fine. Let's go with that pose right when Eun-gi walks in. Let's self destruct together, Ma'ru. Are you kidding me? What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? You were a reporter at one time, but you didn't seem to know what self destruct means. This is how you self destruct. Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? What is this, Joon-ha? What is this? You only play games like that when you're holding comparable cards. Don't you know the rules of the game? Why are you playing a losing hand? Are you a moron? How can someone with a lot to lose beat someone who has nothing more to lose? Our attitudes in life are different. Did you say you'd come to get me? Did you say you'd bring me down? You can't get me just by raising your status. You may have to drop down an endless pit as you say, and keep falling lower and lower, perhaps into a sewer worse than you can imagine, and maybe even onto a pile of garbage much dirtier and disgusting than that. Probably. You know that, but you'll still come? Knowing all that? Will you still come? Fine. Let's see where this goes. I have no intention of coming down. You have no intention of stopping. What can we do, but take it all the way? Let's take it all the way and see. THE BAR IS CLOSED TODAY What? Jae-hui. You didn't bring your car, did you? Please, get in. You don't look well. Should I take you to the hospital? No. My back just gives me trouble once in a while. Don't worry about it. I know the mountain you want to climb is something else. I have the will and power to be used for your ambitions. So... just use me. Don't like me. That would make it easier for you endure the person that I am. The bar's closed tonight? Why was Jae-hui here? Did she come to see you? Dressed all sexy? Ma-ru! - What? - What does Jae-hui want after all this time? What? Does she want to start over or something? What? She'll get divorced and come back to you? Are you crazy? You're getting ahead of yourself again. Why are you alone? Didn't she come with you? Took you long enough to ask. Who? Girlfriend number 17-1? Didn't she come with you? She did, but she said something came up, and took off in the cab we came in. What came up? I don't know. This is good. You know I broke up with Yu-ra, right? I can't let it show at home because of Choco. I can't cry. Have a drink with me. Comfort me, my friend. What do you think you're doing? Do you have nothing better to do? Please, have a seat. Was this posted online? OL Group photoshopped people's faces into a photo and started trouble recently. Did you report this to the police? It's from the CCTV at your house. It was not fabricated or altered. Please calm down and have a seat. The chairman just made a deal regarding your reinstatement. That's not what we should be talking-- He said if you could resolve the labor strike in two days, he will reinstate you to your position. What are you talking about? That's not what we need to discuss! I sent you that picture because I knew you wouldn't listen. I knew you'd come back. Return to work quickly, at all cost. The chairman's health is getting worse. Madam Han... will use the Aomori deal to become actively involved in management starting next month. They'll resort to anything it takes. If you don't act now, you may never be able to return ever again. Does the chairman know as well? No. His health isn't good. I didn't want to shock him and risk something happening. Good. What will you do? Ma'am. Be quiet, please. Ma'am. I'm thinking right now! So just be quiet. THE CHAIRMAN Yes, sir. You can locate Jae-hui's phone, right? Yes, sir. I can. Locate her phone right now, and find out where she is. Isn't Madam Han at home? She went to see Eun-seok's kindergarten teacher. But I think... the meeting was canceled. Then she must be meeting other friends because her appointment-- I told you. I... I only trust women 30 percent. It still holds true now. Yes, sir. I'll track her phone and find out where Madam Han is. Yes, sir. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me right now. Give me the bank book! It's not mine. It's Ma-ru's! He gave me his tuition money. It's not mine! I have to pay it back! Give it to me! No. Over my dead body. It's Ma-ru's. This is Ma-ru's. SEO EUN-GI SEO EUN-GI Hello. Hello. Thank you for coming. I was worried that you wouldn't want to talk to me, since you think I'm a conniving traitor. What do you want? I'd like to have a drink. You and I used to drink soju together often. I'll accept all your conditions if you have a drink with me. I know you don't trust me, so I'll write up an oath in front of the lawyer. You can drink the most among the union members, right? Let's make a bet. If you out-drink me, you get all your demands. If I out-drink you, you have to listen to my demands. Okay? Ma'am. Do we have a deal? Yu-ra. CHOCO Yu-ra. I can't believe you really left just because I told you to. You're... so... mean. Why did you pretend like you were fine? You were dancing all silly so I wouldn't feel bad. Why are you so cool and handsome? Jae-gil. Jae-gil, get up. You can't sleep here. You'll get sick. Get up. Choco. I'm sorry. It's my fault. What can I do? Tell me. What do you want? Yu-ra? Should I tell her to come back? What? What did you say? A watch? You want a watch? What? Ma-ru's watch? You want Ma-ru's watch? My brother's watch? Yeah. This watch looks much better on you than on my brother. Let's go home now. Ma-ru, you can get yourself home. Bye. STRIKE LET'S DESTROY SEO EUN-GI Excuse me. I have to relieve myself. Why are you doing something so reckless? Maybe they'll think it's cute and go easy on me. There's only one way to solve the labor dispute in two days. Hire thugs to hit them, beat them up, and drag them away using violence. He knew I couldn't do it. All he cares about is Jae-hui. He just wants to screw me over. Ms. Seo. I thought about it. The... The best thing I can do right now is... Let's run. Sorry? Get the car before they notice. What happened? Sorry. Something suddenly came up. Did you drink? I just had some soju. But you know, I'm curious. What... did you do to me? What on earth did you do to me? Why were you in my head all day long? Why were you walking, running, and flying in my head all day? Seriously. Ma-ru. You're driving me crazy. I can't get any work done because of you. I can't concentrate... because... I can't stop thinking about you. And I miss you. I'm not like this. I'm really not like this. What's going on? Am I imagining you again? How much did you drink? Wow. My hallucination seems so real. It's totally in RealD 3D. I feel bad when I think about your life, but think of it as a nightmare for one day in your long life. My hallucination is talking. You'll wake up from the nightmare soon. With time, you won't even remember what happened in your dream. It's so neat. My hallucination is talking. JOON-HA Seo Eun-gi's phone. Who is this? Is Ms. Seo there? She had a lot to drink. She's sleeping. I only answered because I didn't want anyone to worry. I'm Kang Ma-ru. Are you the man that she said was her boyfriend? Yes. I see. That's good, then. She suddenly disappeared. I was worried... Okay. I'm sorry for calling so late. Good night. I'm sorry for calling so early. This is Park Joon-ha, in-house counsel at Taesan. May I get a close-up of all the people in the surveillance videos you had sent me? How did I get here? I think you came to the neighborhood on your own. I brought you the rest of the way. It must have been a sight to see. A little. What did I say? Not much. Just this and that. Did I tell you I'm going crazy because I like you? You did. What else? Don't ask. It might make you throw up because it's so cringy. When I made such cringy confessions, did you respond at all? I did. How? Aren't you hungry? You threw up a lot. Tell me again. I didn't hear you. I don't remember. It's not fair. Let's eat. What did you say to me? CCTV SURVEILLANCE ROOM Ms. Hyun, I have a question. Is Ms. Seo's boyfriend's name Kang Ma-ru? Why are you being so difficult? What did you say to me? Seo Eun-gi. You crapped out. You're screwed now, by the jerk Kang Ma-ru. Do you want to run away? Get up, put your shoes on, and run away from me with all your strength. This is your only chance. Is that what you really said? So? How did I answer? You didn't answer yet. May I answer you now? You look so pretty. The dress looks very good on you. - Doesn't it? - It does. Shall we start? Let's start the interview immediately after the photo shoot. Sure. Let's do that. Go ahead and take that. - You're done, right? - Yes. We're done with the photos. Thank you. KANG MA-RU Han Jae-hui speaking. Jae-hui. It's your big brother. It's been a while, baby sister. Where are you? - Does it hurt? - It does. Hey... - What happened? - Ma-ru. Jae-hui's brother beat poor Jae-gil to a pulp-- It's nothing. It's nothing. I walked into-- You did not! Why is that thug looking for Jae-hui here? We haven't seen her for years. Shouldn't you get to work? I know it's a part-time job, but it's not right. Jae-sik was here? - What? - Be quiet. Tell me what happened. Well... Jae-hui's thug brother got out of prison. He came over earlier, and demanded we tell him where Jae-hui is. He broke everything and hit Jae-gil. Forget it, Ma-ru. Just forget it, okay? He had a murderous look in his eyes. It looked like he would kill Jae-hui if he found her. Just stay out of it. If he comes here again, I'll deal with it. Just say you don't know anything, and don't do anything. Please. But he searched your room to find her phone number, and took your cell phone. LET'S DESTROY SEO EUN-GI Have a seat. Do you feel all right? Of course not. You need to sign this as promised. Of course. Just a minute. Do you have a pen? LABOR AGREEMENT Let's take a look. First. "All 2011 wages should be a two percent raise from 2010." Okay. Next. "Build a lounge for the employees." This could be possible by selling the buildings in Seocho-dong and Dogok-dong. Third. "Full financial aid for tuition up to high school regardless of the number of children." LABOR AGREEMENT My car, my bike, my mom's jewelry and all the funds I have could pay for half. Maybe I can get a loan for the rest. We can do that to get through this year. Starting next year, you can have my dividends for your budget. The final demand. "Full reinstatement of the nine union members who were fired." Three of them caused a fatal loss to the company. The president of this subsidiary will never allow it. He won't allow reinstatement of the other six either. I'll hire them myself and pay them like regular employees, okay? I'll dispatch them here, so they can work here. Wait. I'm sure the chairman didn't send his daughter to settle this with your personal assets. - Are you sure this is all right? - What could he do? The worst he could do is remove me from the family register. Are we almost done? Let's end this and have another drink. Ms. Seo. If you want to criticize me, send me a text. I feel like crap. I'm in no condition to respond right now. What is this? Look at it when you have time. Excuse me. You're going to Ma-ru's house, right? Yes. Good. I'm his neighbor. I live just uphill from him. Give this to him for me. The studio down there is closing and opening a new business. The owner asked me to give this to him. Okay. Sure. Thank you. You're looking for Jae-hui? I'll get revenge for you, too. You want to use my brother, too? The surveillance videos were taken. Mr. Ahn and Madam Han were caught together on camera. The chairman would like to see you. He approached you to get revenge against Madam Han. What should I do with him? Don't you dare touch him. Do not touch a single hair on his body.
