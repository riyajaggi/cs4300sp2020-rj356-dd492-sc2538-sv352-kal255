 I ever told anyone that I loved them. The first time in the 29 years that I've lived. "I love you, Eun-gi." That was the first heart-fluttering profession of love I had ever heard. Thanks to you. It looked like I had everything I could possibly want. It looked like I lacked nothing. But... that's how pathetic my life was. But... But... Thanks to a man named Kang Ma-ru, I'm happy

 to be alive and to breathe for the first time ever. That's why after thinking about it a million times, I decided I couldn't lose you even if I lost everything I had. That's what I decided five hours ago. Now, my only wish right now... is to see you every day, tell you I love you every day, hear you tell me you love me every day, share the same dream with you, have a child and raise the child together... and just grow old together. Is that possible? What did you do with your shoes? I don't remember what I did with them. You didn't eat, did you? Your good looking face is ruined. I have no food here. I'll go pick something up. What do you want? How much did they beat you? These are my sister's. Wear them for now. Were you hurt anywhere else? Let me see. To be honest, I like my face right now. It's much more humane. I was tired of my picture-perfect face. I'm not kidding. I didn't put anything on it so it wouldn't heal quickly. I'll get some food. You should change. Tell me I did the right thing. That... this is the life you wanted for me, Mom. That it will be hard, but I should be strong and keep at it. Give me strength, Mom. I was bored and opened your desk drawer and found this. Let's take a trip here if the weather is nice tomorrow. Our first trip just by ourselves. Eun-gi. Ma-ru! Hey! Hi. Are you studying for your exams? Are you done already? I just stopped by. I have to go back. Okay. Tada! What's that? My boss took it when he was there for a conference. Isn't it beautiful? Let's go on a trip there. Our first trip just by ourselves. I'll request some time off. Let's go after your exams. Okay? We'll see. Stop playing hard to get. If you keep that up, I'll go with another man. Can I do that? Of course not! Where is this place? What do we do, Ma-ru? What do we do about our poor Choco? What are you doing? Hey! Are you real or are you a ghost? Me? I'm real. You didn't die? Why would I die? Were you crying? No. The B&B; owner said you ate rat poison and died. I was going to jump in the ocean and die, too. Is there someone else named Choco at the B&B;? Their dog's name is Choco. Choco ate rat poison and died? Oh, no. Why did they name their dog Choco? That's confusing. My dad's the one who gave me a dog's name. There are two other dogs named Choco in our village. Hey. Why did your dad give you a dog's name? I was a real crybaby when I was little. But I stopped crying when they gave me chocolate. I stopped crying when they called me Choco, that's why. My dad didn't really care about me. He only loved Ma-ru. So... - Are you jealous? - No. But when I have a baby, I don't want my baby to think I'm something to eat. Let's go. Poor Choco. She was really pretty. Is rat poison that tasty? Ji-hyun. You! You're Ji-hyun from now. It means you're wise and intelligent. I saved it for my daughter, but you can have it. Kang Ji-hyun. Jae-gil. - Do you like it? - Yes. It's awesome. Can't you change my last name, too, while you're at it? To what? Jun. Jun Ji-hyun. Sure, Jun Ji-hyun. From now on, your name is Jun Ji-hyun. Yes! But Jae-gil... You said you thought I had died and were going to jump in the ocean and die, too. I did? When? Why? Never. That's what you said. Look into my eyes and say it again. You never give up, do you? Forget it then. You don't have to get mad! EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH HAN JAE-HUI, TAESAN GROUP'S CHAIRMAN'S FIANCEE Just tell me where Jae-hui is. I heard she became the mistress of the chairman of Taesan Group. But that's nonsense. He had a murderous look in his eyes. It looked like he would kill Jae-hui if he found her. HAN JAE-HUI POWER OFF Should I ring this up? Yes, please. The phone is turned off. Please leave--  The chairman knows everything. How... How... How... He's been monitoring the surveillance videos regularly. He did that since his first wife. Last night, he excluded me and met with Mr. Park and Mr. Min and rewrote his will. He's going to leave everything he has... His fortune, shares of the company, everything to Ms. Seo Eun-gi. What about me? No. No. What about Eun-seok? Eun-seok is his son. What about him? Let's go... beg for forgiveness. Let's get on our knees and beg and beg until he forgives us. Mr. Ahn. We can't be forgiven. He wouldn't forgive us either. You know what he's like. Ms. Seo knows who Kang Ma-ru is and about your relationship with him. Eun-gi... knows about my relationship with Ma-ru? Yes. That's why she's not letting go of him, just to spite you. That's what I think. The chairman and Ms. Seo... They are scary people you could never beat They are much worse than you can imagine. Pack your things and leave... right away. The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone. Ma-ru. Help me. My brother is going to kill me. You were the only person I could call. I'm sorry. Help me just this once. Your message has been sent. NEW VOICE MESSAGE JOON-HA I can't believe I slept this long. Am I that comfortable here? Ma-ru. Help me. My brother is going to kill me. You were the only person I could call. I'm sorry. Help me just this once. Ma-ru. Ma-ru! Is Jae-sik there right now? You should call the police. Are you hurt? How bad is it? Stop crying and talk! Hello? Where are you? Ma-ru. Ma-ru. Let's take that trip. KANG MA-RU I have some business to take care of. It's too late to go today, so let's go on our trip tomorrow. There's rice in the rice cooker. Go ahead and eat. KANG MA-RU AND HAN JAE-HUI ARE AT THE YANGPYEONG COTTAGE KANG MA-RU AND HAN JAE-HUI ARE AT THE YANGPYEONG COTTAGE Where's Jae-sik? I don't know. He must have taken off because you were coming. Where's the first-aid kit? Over there, in the living room. I didn't think you'd come. Thanks, Ma-ru. KANG MA-RU AND HAN JAE-HUI ARE AT THE YANGPYEONG COTTAGE Hello? Why don't you answer your phone? Do you carry it around for show? Who is this? Don't you recognize my voice? Bring some money here right now. I was tricked by some con artists. They charged me 3 million won for drinks. What are you saying? You drank expensive liquor. You had fun drinking with a girl by your side, didn't you? Why did a penniless bum drink expensive liquor? When did I tell you to bring me expensive liquor? You brought it so you could rip me off. Rip you off? You little rat. You douchebag. I don't rip people off! Why I ought to... Stop it already. Be quiet, will you? Keep that up, and I'll put both of you in jail. Sit down. I said to sit! Hello? Hey! Where are you - right now? - Busan. I'm at a police station. A friend wanted to talk business, so I came last night. That shithead took off with my wallet. Hello? You don't have to come to Busan. I'll text you my account number. Just wire the money. You heard him say it's 3 million won, right? When you send the money, send an extra million won for me. Hello? You still there? Next time I see Jae-hui, I'll tell her to pay you back triple. Hello? Ma-ru. Hey! What have I... done to you? You're right. I was crazy. I wasn't in my right mind. I don't know what happened to me. I wasn't thinking straight. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ma-ru. You... know me too well. You know me much better than I know myself. The part of me that confused me. The part of me I didn't want to believe. The part of me I wanted to deny. It's as if you're living inside of me. You know me frighteningly well. Isn't that right? What do you mean? You knew. I didn't actually want revenge, but that it was an excuse to see you. You knew it was my foolish inability to let go. - Ma-ru. - "Ma-ru, help me." Whenever you asked, I even left my sister who was sick with a high fever and ran over to you like a madman. You knew I'd come to you again, just as I did six years ago. You knew that no matter what you did, I'd understand and be patient, and that I'd forgive you, and endure it. You knew that. Right? You knew that even after everything you did to me, I'd come running like someone whose brain wasn't functioning, like someone with amnesia, like someone with no self-respect. I'll do everything you say. You said I didn't belong there, and that it was no place for someone like me, and to come down, right? Yes. I'll come down. I can give up everything as long as I have you. I can leave it all. I can give it all up. I'll come down to where I came from. Even if it's worse than the sewer... that I grew up in, I'll come down. I'm going to leave it all. I'll do it today. Right now, if I have to. No. Don't. Don't do that. Ma-ru. Wherever you are, wherever you go, wherever your path ends, whether it's hell or destruction, I don't care anymore. What do you mean? What do you mean? Ma-ru! I mean, my feelings for you... are finally gone. You're mine now. I've claimed you. Tada! Let's go on a trip there. Our first trip just by ourselves. We'll see. If you keep that up, I'll go with another man. Can I do that? Of course not. All done. Thank you! What was that? It's really good. Is it because of Eun-gi? Do you have feelings for her or something? Did you... grow to love her or something? Ma-ru. I made a mistake. I regret getting her involved. KANG MA-RU You don't look too well. Did you try calling Eun-gi? She's not answering her phone. I haven't seen Madam Han all day. Did she go somewhere? Joon-ha. Yes, sir. What I instructed you to do before... We'll need to speed it up. Must you really... go that far? Think of Eun-seok, too. I won't be alive for long anyway. If I don't settle it, it'll be too hard on my poor Eun-gi... who will be left all alone. JOON-HA LET'S GO ON OUR FIRST TRIP JAE-HUI AND MA-RU The chairman drew his sword. I don't think you and I can get out of this. You should hide. I'll take care of things here. Don't go home. Hide. HBS Newsroom. I'd like to provide some information about Taesan's chairman Seo Jeong-gyu. What kind of information is it? And who are you? Where are you? I'm Han Jae-hui, a reporter with HBS Newsroom. You want to expose him for all of this? That's right. Seo Jeong-gyu's involvement with countless women, secret slush funds, illegal real estate investments, siphoning money overseas to foreign accounts, market manipulation, accounting fraud... I'm going to expose it all and put an end to Taesan and Seo Jeong-gyu. I'll do it. Do you really think this could end him? A typhoon can break some branches and the leaves may fall off, but when spring comes, new branches will grow again, and so will the leaves. What? Just take this to him and make a deal. You worked for Taesan all your life, but they threw you out like trash and framed you for corporate espionage. Demand compensation for your youth and the injustice. Think about it one more day and call me. Hey, you. You know Seo Jeong-gyu, don't you? What are you talking about? Yes. Now, I remember. I heard there was a female HBS reporter that he had in his pocket. Is it you? - Why you... - Right. Come to think of it, you're exactly his type. Why is a reporter... so sexy and pretty? Stop it! SEO EUN-GI PERSONAL INFORMATION OF HAN JAE-HUI GRADUATE OF HANKUK UNIVERSITY PERSONAL INFORMATION OF AHN MIN-YEONG GRADUATE OF HANKUK UNIVERSITY {\an8}LAWYER AHN MIN-YEONG I said let's come together. Why did you come alone? I suddenly wanted to see the ocean. Thanks for the clothes and shoes. How did you know my size so well? You must be a player. Something like that. It's much better than the picture, isn't it? I didn't know there was such a beautiful place in Korea. It's not... your first time here, is it? It is my first time. I was supposed to come with someone before, but we never made it. With whom? Someone I loved. Who was that? Han Jae-hui. - Do you think it could work between us? - That's why I left everything. Eun-seok is your son, too! Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! You asked for help. Crazy bastard. Help! Was everything you said and showed me calculated and planned? Do you think there was anything I couldn't do to get Jae-hui back?
