 Kang Ru-ma? What's Kang Ru-ma? It's not Kang Ru-ma. It's Kang Ma-ru. How does that say, "Kang Ma-ru"? It says, "Kang Ru-ma." She must not know how to spell. Yeah. She must be stupid. - I can spell. - Me, too. Is this right then? "Kang Ma-ru." Oh, my... She must really be stupid.

 How could an adult not know how to spell? Who is that? Who is he? That's my crayon. KANG MA-RU Jae-geon, Ju-eun, let's eat. - Okay! - Okay! Yes. Now I remember. Kang Ma-ru. I knew that. Ms. Seo! Oh, no. Where did she go? Ms. Seo! Excuse me.

 Did you see a woman standing here? She has long hair and is wearing a white sweater. She's in her late 20s. I think I saw her over there. Oh, no. Ms. Seo! Ms. Seo! Ms. Seo! I... lost my memory. I was told I was in a car accident. That's why I don't remember anything. I only know that my name is Seo Eun-gi because I worked hard to memorize it. All I have left is this camera. And you're the only person in here. KANG MA-RU The person who took care of me said the man in these photos was Kang Ma-ru. That's why I came. I couldn't remember who Kang Ma-ru was... or who the man in this photos was... at all earlier. But it came back to me as soon as I saw your face. I remember who you are now. We were... deeply and madly... in love, weren't we? Right? Ms. Seo! Ms. Seo! I told you to wait there. Why did you wander off? I thought I lost you. Hello. We met briefly before at the hospital. Ms. Seo sent me to see you. I'm her personal assistant. You must be... pretty shocked. I found him. I recognized... Kang Ma-ru first. Mirror. I've been here before, right? I'm sure I have. I'm going to remember everything myself, so don't say anything. Don't tell me. Give me some time. Because of the car accident, her temporal lobe and parietal lobe were damaged. That's why not only does she have amnesia, she also forgot most of the knowledge she had gathered over the years. That's why she couldn't write your name... She can't read or write properly. She can't tell direction either, and counts with her fingers. I can't tell you everything, but she's not normal in many ways. Her personality changed a lot, too. That's why I had no choice but to take her away, and keep her hidden from other people. If Taesan, especially Han Jae-hui, finds out about her condition, she will never be able to take over management. They will find a way to drive her out. And... even her life... may be endangered. I don't think the chairman's death was purely due to his illness. Based on the circumstances, I'm sure Han Jae-hui was involved with his death. I'm sure of it. I wasn't going to let her go out and into the world until she was completely recovered. But she saw the camera in my car and kept begging me to find you. The doctor looking after her said seeing you might help her get her memory back. That's why I came to ask for your help. She has to return to Taesan as soon as possible. She has to reclaim what was taken from her. - Please-- - Why me? Pardon? Why me? Because you were the only person she trusted and loved. That's her problem. You came to the wrong person. You and I have nothing to do with each other. We were in love? Who? Us? Do all people who take a picture together become lovers? And... I don't have the time to waste on your stupid power struggle. It's not a stupid power struggle. She's trying to claim what is rightfully hers. Hey! Ma-ru! Huh? I saw you earlier. Did you find the woman you were looking for? Yes, I did. You must have come to see Ma-ru. How do you know Ma-ru? Hey! What are you doing in broad daylight? I have business with her right now. Call me later. You punk. Don't do that here. I'll get you a room. The new motel that they just built is really nice. Okay? Fine, I'll go. Punk. Call me when you're done with that lady, okay? I have something to discuss with you. Aren't you leaving? You should give them some privacy. In a little while. It's so strange. People show their love in such strange ways now. He's so weird. He's really weird. Wait 30 minutes before you go. Did we speak informally to each other? Okay. I'll do that again, then. Are you embarrassed of me... because I'm like this? Because I lost my memory and became stupid? Are you disappointed in me? Is that why you're pretending not to know me? You just have to wait a little. You just have to teach me a little. Then I can remember everything and completely recover soon. I'd try much harder than I have been. It looks like you lost your sense of judgment due to the accident. We only took a few pictures together. That's all. There wasn't any love. We just... knew each other briefly. My heart knew. My heart... remembered you. My heart remembered... you. I'm a bit busy. If you have time, you should help her finish her novel. That prick. I know you have poor taste in men, but how could you... Let's go. Ms. Seo. Ms. Seo. Don't do this. It's not your fault. You did nothing wrong. We came to the wrong place. We came to the wrong person. No. I know him. I remember him. I mean it. I'm telling you the truth! Oh, no. Ms. Seo! MISSING PERSON 300 MILLION WON REWARD Next is a report on the slow city and healing resort in Jeju. This project began in 2009 for mutual growth with the local community. HAN JAE-SIK There is a thick forest in the vicinity that optimizes biorhythms. It is the optimum location for improving your health. JEJU RESORT PROJECT Seo Eun-gi is the project manager? Yes. She was directly involved from three years ago and created this project, from choosing the location and planning the city. Currently, only the detailed negotiations with Jeju City remain. The construction will be-- Stop. Put a stop on this project as of this moment. Pardon? Let's put the luxury hotel to draw in the VVIP clients of Asia here in this location. Considering the surrounding area, this location seems appropriate. - But... - Why? Is there a problem? Well... It took Ms. Seo over two years just to receive approval from the residents and officials for this Jeju project. The project was worked on for 4 years already. To stop it without approval-- Approval? Whose approval? The approval of Seo Eun-gi who has been missing for a year? Well... Yes. You're right. I might be the chairman of Taesan, but I can't do anything I want without the approval of Seo Eun-gi, the CEO of Taesan Resort. Naturally, I can't. Let's end today's meeting. With how many of Taesan's subsidiaries is Eun-gi a director? Five including the resort, cosmetics and apparel. How long does it take to call a board meeting? I'd like to make a motion. Regarding what? The dismissal of Seo Eun-gi, the CEO of Taesan Resort. What are they doing? We should be going forward. How long must we walk in place, waiting for someone who's dead? We're Taesan. Most of the board members are favorable toward Eun-gi. They won't vote for her dismissal that easily. It is impossible. Shall we see whether it's impossible or possible? I'll come in a little later. Ms. Seo. I won't run away. I'll go in after one minute. I just want to think. Then come in after just one minute, okay? If you don't, I'll come to get you. You and I have nothing to do with each other. We were in love? Who? Us? Do all people who take a picture together become lovers? It looks like you lost your sense of judgment due to the accident. We only took a few pictures together. That's all. There wasn't any love. We just... knew each other briefly. Liar. Okay. AHN MIN-YEONG, JAE-HUI'S PAWN Even this punk is ignoring my calls. They're really going to regret it. THROW A BALL. GO HOME. DRINK JUICE. SEO EUN-GI KANG MA-RU THE KOALA SAT IN THE TREE. Come in. You said I was very smart before I hurt my head and lost my memory, right? Yes. People said you were a prodigy. What? They said you were a genius nonstop as well. How pretty. Thank you. How is your studying coming along? Well... Just... I know it's hard, but hang in there. I have a lot to tell you as soon as you get your memory back. Like what? Can't you tell me now? Not now. I'll tell you when you are fully recovered and have the strength to handle what I have to say. I'll tell you everything, without hiding anything. Do you think I could get fully recovered? Can I return to being... to my old self again? I'm sure you will. I'll make sure that you do. {\an8}ARE YOU CRYING? What's wrong with him? Give us some privacy. Do you want to sing? Should I sing? Should I tell the girls to come back and dance for us? I... am a despicable human being. The company fed and clothed my family all these years. But I'm betraying them... because of my personal problems-- There's no need for guilt. You're doing this for your dying wife and your son. You can ignore your conscience and principles once in your life. I'll be punished for this. Do you believe there is a god who will punish you? Do you believe there's a heaven? I don't believe there is a god or a heaven. If there were a god, He wouldn't let the world be the shithole it is. I don't feel like drinking anymore. If at some point, you hear that Kang Ma-ru was struck by lightning and dropped dead, then you can believe there is a god. I'll get going. Come to the hospital right now. I'm a little-- Should I bring the CAT scan to your sister? Should I explain it to her? Look. See the blood accumulated here? The meningeal artery was ruptured. Blood pooled between the cranium and the dura mater. I'm talking about you. There must have been minute hemorrhaging since the accident. I told you to come for a follow-up. Why didn't you listen to me? How can you do this to your brain? You must have had symptoms. If you had nausea or headaches, you should have come. Why did you let it get this far? I know you were expelled, but you finished three years at the medical college. I'm going to put in a complaint that a doctor is yelling at a patient. You have to be admitted. Let's stop the hemorrhaging. I'll try to get a surgery date as soon as possible. There might be aftereffects of surgery. {\an8}Brain edema, seizure, paralysis, infection. I might not wake up at all. So? I'll think about it some more. Whether the surgery is worth all those risks. Then... you want to die while thinking about it more? I'm really going to report you for threatening and scaring a patient. Ma-ru. The fatality rate is about 20 percent? I have shitty luck, but... not this time, right? I won't be in that 20 percent, will I? Ma-ru. I'm kidding. I'll get the surgery. I will. There are a few things I have to do first. I'll come as soon as I'm done. Don't worry. Give me some painkillers. Hella strong ones. SEO EUN-GI KANG MA-RU I met Kang Ma-ru today. I recognized him right away. However, he keeps lying. I MET KANG MA-RU TODAY My mommy is always busy. She doesn't play with me and she doesn't read to me. ME, EUN-GI I miss my sister Eun-gi. I wish Eun-gi would come back and play the monster game with me. Mommy. - Did you take a bath? - Yes. I'll do the rest. You may go. Yes, ma'am. Sit down. Let's put on lotion. Do you miss Eun-gi? Yeah. Why? She doesn't like you that much. She always yells at you and scolds you. She's still my sister. Don't you miss Eun-gi, Mommy? I do miss her. I miss her, but if she comes back, you and I will be in danger. Huh? What? Why will we be in danger? Never mind. It's nothing. Don't wait for Eun-gi. I'm sure it's hard for her to come back. I won't let her come back. Ever. Kang Ma-ru. If you remember me at some point, give me a call. I'll be waiting. SEO EUN-GI Where did you go? Did you scam weak, powerless people again? Where's Choco? Is she sleeping? She ran away. What? She packed up and left. She says she won't accept anything from you again, and that she won't spend any of your dirty money. This afternoon, she withdrew from all her savings accounts, insurance and funds and took the cash and gave it to that kid who came the other day. Fortunately, that man you scammed didn't die. She told them to use the money for his hospital bills and to buy a store and start over. Why didn't you stop her? What were you doing when she was acting crazy like that? Why should I stop her? I want to compliment and applaud her. You bastard. I don't know where she learned it, but she has solid morals. I don't know how someone like you has a sister like her. Do you know how I made that money? Do you know what I did to make that money for her? It's because we know what you did to make that money! We know you sold your body and soul to make that money. How could she spend that money? Put yourself in her shoes. Would you spend that money? She'd rather die. You bastard. That's why... I'm leaving, too. After going to that kid's home today, it's suddenly too hard for me to breathe the same air as you. Ji-hyun. Jae-gil. Who is she? Hold on. I'm tired. Who was that old woman? I met her here today. She said she couldn't sleep because her legs hurt. You don't look well. Do you feel sick? My heart hurts, that's why. I'm old now, so when my heart hurts, my body hurts, too. That's right. It must be hard to be old. What about Ma-ru? What about him? Is he all right? Why did you do that if you're so worried? Who says I'm worried? I'm not worried. He won't snap out of it unless I'm gone. I need to be gone for him to snap out of it and live a proper life. He's living because of you. He'd be dead already if it weren't for you. You shouldn't be so mean to him. Even if everyone curses at him, judges him, and criticizes him, you shouldn't. Don't talk if you're going to take his side. Hey. Put yourself in his shoes. Do you think he's happy doing what he does? - Stop it. - Do you? Fine. You're an angel and Ma-ru is the devil. You know what he did to make that money, but you... Fine. Do what you want and rebel. HAN JAE-SIK {\an8}I'LL BE WAITING. SEO EUN-GI {\an8}I RECOGNIZED HIM RIGHT AWAY. I'm really the chairman's brother! Seriously! He said he came to see you. I said you weren't here yet, and he insisted on waiting in your office. - Me? - Yes. Hey, sweetie. You have a nice figure. Did you eat? I don't have money to eat. I didn't even have gas money and barely made it here. Am I a beggar? I'll have my secretary get some cash. How much will you give me? How much do you need? I heard the 20-story apartment building at Gwanghwamun was Taesan's. Give me that. There you go again! Don't glare at me. I didn't say I'd take it for free. I saw that girl. Taesan Group's missing successor. The pretty girl. It would be bad for you and Jae-hui if she came back. You'd lose everything. Where is this place? Where did you see her? Would you share that intel for free if you were me? Will you give me the building or not? Come in. Mr. Jo is here. How is it going? The board members are throwing a fit. They seem to be traumatized upon hearing that Ms. Seo Eun-gi had been keeping reports on them to keep tabs on them. What about the ones favorable to her? Their feelings of betrayal and shock appear to be substantial. Of course, there are some who say it can't be real, and that it was all fabricated. MR. PARK JOON-HA Answer it. It's Mr. Park. Hello? Can we meet for a few minutes? {\an8}DIRECTOR SEO EUN-GI What brings you here? I sent Mr. Jo on a personal errand. If you have anything to say, say it to me. Did you remove the hard disk from Ms. Seo's computer? You gave the reports on the board members on the hard disk to the board members, didn't you? What comes next in your plan if the board members turn their backs on Ms. Seo? The CEO of a company couldn't trust the people she worked with. How could she investigate and monitor them like that? Does that make sense to you? If the media found out-- It wasn't Ms. Seo! When the chairman was alive, he gave those reports to her. She was furious about them and destroyed them immediately. How can the destroyed files be restored and circulating like this? I wonder. Mr. Park Joon-ha. Why do you think I'm still keeping you around at the company? I know you'll stab me in the back someday. Why do you think I'm keeping you here? You're a dangerous person, but it's worth the risk because you're charming and smart. You're smart enough to know what you have to do to better your future just like your father. And I... am your superior and the owner of Taesan Group. You can't talk to me like that. Show respect. You're not making any sense. Why are you lying? That's why you fell for me. You saw me pretend to put my life on the line for you. That's why someone like you fell for me just like that. Do you think there was anything I couldn't do to get Jae-hui back? Haneul is sky. Gureum is... Clou... Clou... Grass. Grass is... Seo Eun-gi. I'm Seo Eun-gi. Kang Ma-ru. Kang Ma-ru. Hello! Is anyone home? Open the door! Kang Ma-ru sent me. Kang Ma-ru sent me. Open the door! Isn't anyone home? Who are you? Hello. I think I saw you at Ma-ru's house the other day. I'm his older brother. - Hello. - Hello. He wants to talk to you. He said to bring you. That's why I'm here. He said to bring me because he wanted to talk to me? Yes. But I don't have time right now. We need to go right away to get there in time. Give me one minute. You don't have to change. Just one minute. That was easy. I saw that girl. Taesan Group's missing successor. Where is this place? Where did you see her? Would you share that intel for free if you were me? Will you give me the building or not? Jae-hui is nervous that this girl might show up and demand her place back. She's so nervous, she can't even sleep at nights. She gets all those facials, but her skin so bad because she's nervous. Hey. What if I make sure... this girl never returns to Taesan again? What if I do that? What if I make sure my poor Jae-hui could sleep at night? Could our discussion take a positive turn? Ma'am. You don't look well. Is something worrying you? I'm always worried about something. I heard that the report on the board members is causing unrest among them. I guess dismissal of Ms. Seo won't be impossible. This is just the beginning. Some believe they must protect Eun-gi out of loyalty toward Chairman Seo. It won't be easy to convince them since they were loyal for 30 years. Nothing was ever easy for me. Not even the smallest things. But I always got what I wanted. Miraculously. How far do you think I could go? How low will I go to keep the position I have now? Are you that happy that you're going to see Ma-ru? What is your relationship anyway? We were in love. Deeply... A lot. That punk. He's got skills. He's uglier than I am, too. He's better looking than you. Drink this. It's hot. Thank you. I was thirsty. Ms. Seo is here, right? No. I was told she was here, so I came to get her. By whom? Look. Kang Ma-ru wanted to talk to me and sent someone to get me. I guess he remembers me now. I'll be back soon. I never told anyone to bring her. Oh, no. Who took her? I don't know. I was at the market. He must know me since he used my name. Hey Ma-ru! I saw you earlier. Did you find the woman you were looking for? Yes, I did. How do you know Ma-ru? Hey! What are you doing in broad daylight? Hi Chun-ja, it's been a while. I'm bringing a really awesome girl. How much will you give me? She's different from the other girls. Hold on. KANG MA-RU I'll call you when I get on the boat. Okay. Later. {\an8}POWER OFF The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone. That's right. I can track her. Her phone. I installed a tracker app after the accident. Should I call the police? No. I'll look for her. I'm taking this. Then how will you call me? Hey! YANGPYEONG, GYEONGGI PROVINCE Gwanghwamun Apartment building 20-story building Yes! Yes! YANGPYEONG, GYEONGGI PROVINCE The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone. REST STOP MS. HYUN The person you have reached is unavailable. What did you do to Eun-gi? Who put you up to it? Nobody put me up to anything! When did I do that? Do you have proof? You know where she is, right? Why won't she show herself when she's alive and well? A deal? Please help Eun-gi reach her desired destination safely. It wasn't love to begin with anyway. What if it is love now?
