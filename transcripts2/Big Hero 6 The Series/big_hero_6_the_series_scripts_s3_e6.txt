 Hello. I am baymax. Prepare yourselves! I am cutting san fransokyo off from the world! Travel would still be possible on an airplane. Oops. - Fine. Today, ground travel is halted. At a future date, I shall conquer the air! Let's put an end to this. I don't know what's happening, - but I dig it. - No. Is that...?

 It can't be! But what if it is? Baymax, rocket fist! No! Hoisted by my own petard! I will have my revenge, millennials! - ooh. - What just happened? Baron von steamer was "hoisted by his own petard." Uh, okay. Whatever that means. - - aah! Wasabi, you are trembling excessively. I can't believe this is happening! It's 4 2 sing! Yeah! - oh! 4 2 sing! - 4 2...

 The best, most amazing boy band of all time! Are they two sets of twins? Yes! Dae is hyun-ki's brother, and kwan-sun is ye joon's brother. Perfect symmetry. Hello. I am baymax. - Hey, girl. - I am not... aah, look at him! San fransokyo! We, 4 2 sing, have saved you from spider sadness. Why? Because in addition to your favorite boy band, we are now also superheroes! What? I love them. Wait. Why a boy band and superheroes? - Because we're famous! - So we know we can do anything. And we have to differentiate ourselves in an increasingly over-saturated boy band field. - -I can tell by your stupefied expression that you're confused. That is a letter of challenge. To a superhero-off! Whoever can defeat the most "bad guys" in the next 24 hours wins. Do you accept our challenge? - Yeah! - Nah. - Hard pass. - We're gonna go... Okay, for sure? Okay, no. Ha! They fear defeat! We are very intimidating! Actually, you're mostly super cute. - I know. - Humble much? Question... aren't you worried being superheroes will distract you from your musing? More importantly, isn't it a stupid idea? Our challenge has been accepted! That is not accurate. Goodbye! Goodbye! Look! Some glitter landed on me! I'm never gonna wash this sleeve! That's a lie. I'm gonna wash it, but I'm gonna cry when I do it! Stop, villains! Aah! Ha! 4 2 sing takes the lead in the superhero-off. Looks like this is going to be a real competition. Wait, what? They're getting the credit? 4 2 sing wins the superhero-off. Thoughts on your humiliating failure? In celebration of our complete and undisputed victory over big hero 6 today, we have decided to grace you with a surprise concert! You're welcome, san fransokyo! For justice, and beauty! I can't believe I get to see them perform live! I can't believe they're taking the credit for everything we did. I can't believe the city choose 4 2 sing over us. I can't believe we're still talking about this. What's so great about them, besides their perfect hair, flawless dances moves, and awesome dragon? We have mega-max. He's pretty awesome. Yeah. I guess. Aah! Oh, look. Even the dragon's sick of them. Greetings, 4 2 loser... Oh! - All: Aah! Blasted joystick! What's wrong with valves and levers? Aah. I've got it! Now, where was I? I shall now conquer the air with this! Why is there glitter everywhere? - Because it's ours. - And it was expensive. Our dream journal is in that dragon. - - don't worry, everyone. You are under the protection of a boy band! - There's only one thing left to do. - You mean... - Yes! - Our ultimate team attack! We challenge you to a... Dance, dance, dance battle! No! - We call upon the power of beauty to protect... - Aah! Good luck with that. Huh? Hmm. Hurry! We have to save them. Why are we playing music? To show people we're just as cool as 4 2 sing. Hey, I... ow! This thing doesn't even have any weapons! Does, too! Hit the yellow button. Aah. The yellow button? Excellent. Take this, big hero 6! What happened? I, I couldn't see! It puked glitter, didn't it? Yes, it did. Blast! Literally! I will have my revenge, boy band! Even if your songs are delightful ear worms! - Welcome big hero 6 to the stage! - All right! - Woo! - Yeah! We brought you up here because we wanted to tell you something. We mean it from the heart. You're welcome? Um, for what? For when we saved you by distracting the old man with our posing. And good looks. That is not a logical conclusion. - I'm done here. - But also, thank you. - For... - Being great sidekicks! If you follow our lead, you, too, may become great heroes someday. We're great heroes now! I'm getting in on this! I'm with 4 2 sing! Thanks for watching "wendy wower's science hour"! Until next time! Yay! All good things must come to an end. Later-y? Hmm. Needs work. "I want your brain." not again! Go go for the win! Help! Help! - Help! Help! - Answer call, basemax. - Dr. Wower? - Are you in need of assistance? Yes, please! "I want your brain"? Liv amara's clone tried to abduct you. Whoever's sending these notes could try the same thing. No traceable dna found. Huh. Professional job. We'll search for clues while she stays here to protect you. - What? - We're better at the mystery. You're better at the kicking butt. - Fair enough. - Okey-dokey. Should I cancel my show? No. If we're going to catch this creep, you need to act like everything is normal. But they're not gonna make a move if they see a superhero. Ooh! What if you went undercover? I don't like where this is going. Worst fear confirmed. This is gonna be so much fun! Not the word I would use. I can't wait to hear what song you come up with for our first show together! - - song? Welcome to another fun day of science, woweroos! And please help me welcome my new co-host: Chelsea cheery! - Hey. - Are you super-duper excited to be here, chelsea? - Sure. Whatever. - Yay! Isn't she cheery? Look how it creates a whirlpool! What are you doing, chelsea cheery? I am working on reducing friction - in an electro-mag propulsion system. - Mm! Go on! Obviously, if you're gonna achieve electro-magno suspension, - -the friction is already going to be very low, but the more aerodynamic you can make your vehicle, - -the more you can increase the velocity. Get it? Can I get a temporary tattoo of this? Ah, we don't have much to go on. Go go said this was the work of a professional. - Which would suggest... - it's someone we've dealt with before. Uh, basemax, pull up our villain database. Accessing villain database. - High voltage? - Currently performing community service dancing. - Uh, sirque? - Incarcerated. - Um, diane amara. - Incarcerated. - Hardlight? - Incarcerated. Ugh. Who haven't we seen in a while? - Oh! The mad jacks! - They are the new hosts of the popular children's program "bright lights, loud noises." everything's weird now. And now my co-host will debut her super fun science song! What's it called, chelsea? "dark matter." okey-dokey! They literally named it... dark matter. Nothing matters. It's stuck in my head and I'm not going to let it out. Oooookay. Why don't we take a short break? Prison. Retired. Prison... Prison... Prison... Prison... We have received the security camera footage from the sciencetorium. Thank you, baymax. Wait. Go back. There! I detect the presence of roller skates. Is that stu? You are correct. Why would supersonic stu want dr. Wower's brain? Well, he does need a brain. Baymax, scan for stu. - -I have located supersonic stu. You know, if you had a smidge more cheer in your chelsea cheery performance, it might help you blend in more. Know what I mean? The weird kid is into it. This isn't just about him. You have to reach all the woweroos. Get down! Hey! I had to go potty. Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Give up, stu. Without your nana, you can't supersonic stu your way out of this one. Or can I? Nana gave me rocket skates for my birthday. Now I can supersonic stu me... Me. Halt! - he did not halt. I think we're about to learn that chelsea has an electric personality! Yeah. Anyway, static electricity is an imbalance between negative and positive charges. Ugh. So... These charges can build up on the surface. Like your feelings! Until they find a way to be released. See? Science can be - a hair-raising experience. - Yay! I knew you could do it! Yay! Watch out! Hey, kids! Who wants to have fun? Me! Me! I said, who wants to have fun? That's our show for today, woweroos! Until next time! Time out! Time out. Oh, time out. I just need... I just need a sec. Why are you guys even after me? I haven't done anything even remotely criminal. Today. Okay. Except for stealing some baseball cards. And a candy bar. And one of nana's cookies before dinner. And that's it. Two cookies before dinner. What about sending threatening notes to wendy wower? What? I'd never do that! I'm a longtime woweroo. "wendy wower science hour" comes on right after my favorite show, "bright lights, loud noises." - I don't believe you. - Oh, no, really. Check your local listings. So, why were you dressed as a fern, sneaking around wower's classroom? Nana thinks I'm a science genius, but the truth is, I'm not actually so smart. Yet. But I'm working on it. Supersonic stu is telling the truth. He did not send the note. That means whoever did is still out there. - whoa! Aah! - never thought trying to have fun could actually be fun. I cannot contact go go. She doesn't have her comm link in. Let's go. You were great. You know, if you ever want to co-host again, the door's always open. Yeah, maybe. I think I like teaching. But only in disguise. Ha! You? "this is the end"? I think he means the end of the notes. She gets it. So, "I want your brain" means... He wants to be as smart as you are one day. One day soon. I'm so glad you were brave enough to tell us. I find talking to people... - Annoying? - Indeed. But you showed me it's worth it to try. I want your brain now. Get over here. We're here, go go! What is going on? Go go is... is... Is... is... Is... Hugging a child. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
