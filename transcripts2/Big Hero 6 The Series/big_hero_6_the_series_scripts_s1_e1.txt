 ♪ Okay, Hiro, I'm going to let you go now. You ready? No, no, no, Tadashi, wait! Don't be scared, little brother. Just pedal harder! You can do it! Aunt Cass: Yeah! Woo-hoo! Go, Hiro! -Yeah, yeah! You got it! -(beeps) Well, Tadashi, this is it, first day of nerd school. All because of you.

 -(zips zipper) -Ow! Reporter: Reports are still flooding in about a group of unidentified individuals who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe. The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking: Having victory pancakes. -Hiro! -Hey! Come on, let's not be late. Hey, Sweetie. I made you a lunch. Uh, do you pack lunch to college? I don't-- I don't know. Is that not cool? Oh, I'm so proud! -I just wanna squeeze you! -Aunt Cass! I-- -(sighs with relief) -Okay, you guys better go.

 Hiro: Last hug. Tadashi would be so proud of you. -Are you nervous, Hiro? -No way! I want this. Why would I be nervous. You're 14 and going to college. Your brother is, like, a legend here. Also, I hear the new dean is a hard case. I... hadn't thought of any of those things. Well, keep not thinking of them. (camera shutter clicking) Ugh! -That's unfortunate. -I'll take that. Don't ever lose this. Seriously, it's like $20 to replace. Okay, you're official. -Tour time! -Ahhh! This is the room where people wear goggles and do stuff. Hiro: Virtual reality! Oh, nice! Yeah... that. And this is the quad. Named after someone with the last name "Quad," one would presume. (gasps) (beeping) And this, of course, is the fooding zone, as a non-student, my favorite place on campus. Whoa! (bots beeping) -Wow. -Cool, huh? I-I didn't realize this place was so, uh, huge. Awesome, but huge. Don't be intimidated. Just take it one class at a time. Ugh. Applied Particle Physics first. (gasps) Me, too! Yay! What's your first class, Hiro? You okay? We miss Tadashi, too. And Baymax. Yeah, I'll, um, I'll catch up with you guys later. Wish you were here, big brother. Ba-la-la-la-la. Tadashi's chip. Baymax! Um... okay, okay. I'm gonna need... carbon fiber skeleton, actuators... Definitely gonna upgrade to super capacitors. Ha! I can do this! I can rebuild you, Baymax. Good morning. I'm Professor Granville, your new Dean of Students. Welcome to San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. I trust that we are going to have an excellent year... (volume lowers) Which means hard work! Some of us are trying to work. -Mr. Hamada! -Huh? Turn around. Yah! Private labs are not for first semester freshmen. Oh... uh... this is my brother's lab. Or... was. Tadashi was a gifted young man. He worked hard to earn this lab, as I'm sure you will someday, when you're ready. I'm ready now! Look, I'm rebuilding Bayma-- My brother's healthcare companion project. Mr. Hamada, if you want to live up to your brother's legacy, you should start by getting to your classes on time. I could not agree more! Punctuality is very important. -It was so nice to-- -Ticktock, Mr. Hamada. Don't want to keep your Thermodynamics professor waiting. I hear she's tough, but fair-- intermittently. Ah, Teen Genius has decided to join us. -How did you-- -Short. Cut. I can take them. You cannot. Let's begin! (grumbles) Oh, I didn't realize we were still doing the whole superhero thing. Uh, yeah! Wait, where's Hiro? Said he had something he needed to do after school. But he's gonna miss our first night patrol! Night patrol? Where we suit up and patrol the streets, thwart evildoers, dispense justice, etcetera, awesome, etcetera! -Yeah, I'm not gonna do that. -I-I don't think so. Why not? You guys have clearly forgotten how sweet it was being superheros. We caught a revenge-crazed villain, we saved the city, we had victory pancakes! And you have clearly forgotten that we are not superheros. Also, it was really scary! -You didn't seem scared. -Because I was pumped full of adrenaline. Now I'm back to being afraid of things. Heights, speed, cholesterol, loud noises! I've got issues. You do not want to be Wasabi. Sorry, Freddie. We already lost Baymax and we almost lost Hiro. I don't want to lose anyone else. But there could be a super-villain out there right now about to-- Face it, Fred, we aren't in one of your comic books. This is the real world, and in the real world, there are no super-villains. (screams) I'll ask one more time: -Where's my money? -(whimpers) I lost it. Yama, it's him. Go ahead and take the call. Obake. Mm. Whatever you need. What is it? (laughter, static) (beeping) -And where is it? -(static crackles) Done! Please work, please work. -Hello, Hiro. -Baymax! Yeah, the hug's not really-- We'll have to stick with this for now, buddy. Ba-la-la-la-la. Without my body, I am not able to feel. I know. Because I do not have tactile receptors. Oh, right. Don't worry, I'm working on it. ♪ (drill whirs) (yawns) Ah! Baymax: My endoskeleton is complete. You can now move on to the test phase. Tests phase? Ha! Are you kidding? I just have to get you dressed, and boom! The diagnostics protocol will take seven to 10 days. Tadashi always ran an extensive diagnostics protocol. Yeah, that sounds like Tadashi. Here we go. Yes! See, Baymax, it's perfect. (mechanical whirring) Huh? (gasps) No! No, no, no! Come on! No, no! Watch out! Oh, no. My body is running away. Huh? (electrical crackling) Mr. Hamada, what are you doing here at this hour? I was... studying. Yeah, just came out for some... fresh air. Woo! That's fresh. Well, better go. -Follow me. -Actually, I... have nowhere else I need to be, so, I will follow you. When we first met, I was worried you would become distracted by your own agenda. -Or worse. -Uh-huh. You know about the bot fighting. But I have to admit, you've shown discipline. You're doing exceptionally well in your classes. You should be very proud. No, stop! No... stop... giving me compliments. (laughs) I don't want to get a big head. Then I'll just say this. Keep up the good work. I-I will. Thanks. So... tired. Better get home. Uh... bye. Whew. After unrelenting badgering, the team... -Caved. -...came together. Now unified, they embark on their first night patrol, knowing they are the city's last bastion of hope. Could you please stop narrating, Fred? Yeah, nothing's happening, Freddie. I think it might be time to go home. (tires squealing) Did you see that? That, my friends, is obviously a car thief. It's last bastion time! Halt! Yeah, he's not halting. No, he's not! Ah! Ahh! He didn't stop! Fred: And we got a chase scene! (screaming) Pull over, now! Wasabi: Did you not hear her?! We're gonna need something to slow him down. I have just the thing. (Wasabi screaming) Still not stopping! Oh, yes he is! (tires squeal) They fear the lizard. Ha! Justice has been served-- Oh, wait a minute. -(panting) -Are you people crazy? My wife is about to have our baby! Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. You're doing great. Boy or girl? Wait, don't tell me, I wanna be surprised. -(wife groans) -Congratulations on your bundle of joy! So, not a car thief, but we still showed some real hustle out there, guys. Fred, there's clearly nothing going on. (sadly) But, guys, night patrol. (electrical explosion) Uh, that's not good. (Baymax powering down) (laughs) I haven't seen you at the bot fights in a while, little Zero. Not since the night you got me locked up in jail. You're not still mad about that... are you? Okay, well, I'm sorry. If I could just get my robot back-- You're not getting your robot back. Teach him a lesson. In case I wasn't clear before, I'm really sorry about the whole jail thing. Ah! Wait, you go to that nerd school? -Uh, yeah, but it's not-- -Pull him back. You and I, we're gonna make a deal. Alone he stood, buffeted by the rain, unwavering in his mission, and undaunted by the fact that his friends don't value superhero culture in all its awesomeness. Master Frederick, hot cocoa? Heathcliff, where's Fred? I need his help. Okay, so what wrong is Lady Justice calling us to right? Well, there's this metal thing-- it's kind of a sculpture, or paperweight or something-- and it's on Granville's desk and I have to break in and take it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. That is what Lady Justice would call stealing. Stealing? No, it's not stealing. Is it stealing? I don't think it's really stealing. It's more like borrowing, yeah. Baymax: Stealing: to take the property of another without permission or right. Exactly. Thank you, Baymax. Wait, Baymax? Whoa! You live in a computer now? My body ran away. Fred, look, I rebuilt Baymax's skeleton. It went crazy, got loose, and now Yama has it. The thing is, it's dangerous without Tadashi's chip. Without the healthcare protocol, my robotic capabilities could be catastrophically destructive. Yama said he'll give it back in exchange for the paperweight thing. Which you intend to steal. As soon as I make the trade, I'll steal the thing back and return it to Professor Granville before she even knows it's gone. So, the second steal basically cancels out the first steal. Okay, I'm in. Yes! I just need to add her code to my ID, and to do that, I need to get really close to Professor Granville. How close? Are we talking in the same general vicinity, or are we talking uncomfortably close? Uncomfortably close. Fred: Hiro, check, check. Can you hear me? Fred, just wait for the signal and hit the button. I've never been a hacker before. (nervous laughter) This is exciting. Also, a lot of pressure. Uh, which button is it again? I kid, I kid. Don't worry, Hiro, I've got this. (door opens) Target spotted. I'm going in. Roger that. Man, I love saying that. I'll do it again. (deep voice) Roger that. No, no, no, wait. How about this? (British accent) Roger that. Baymax: Who is Roger? Fred: You know, that's a good question. -Guys, quiet. -Roger that! Excuse me, Professor Granville? Yes, Mr. Hamada? Well, I was thinking about what you said, and it's nice to have someone here who believes in me, so thank you. Yes, well, uh-- (Hiro giggles) What is he doing? Is that all? Um... well... Fred: Turn on the waterworks. Trust me. It's the only way you're gonna get that hug. Mr. Hamada, are you all right? I'm... Is there something in your eye? Tears. There's just so much going on. -Now. -(slurps) I'm on it. Ah! I spilled soup! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah! Baymax: I cannot administer care because I have no body. But I do have several tips for treating minor burns. All right, now. Pull yourself together. I got the copy! I think. Thanks! I feel better now. Thank goodness. Don't wanna keep my professor waiting. She's intermittently fair and a good hugger. ♪ Fred: What's happening? -Did you get it? -Yeah. It's heavier than it looks. Why would Yama want this? Ow! Hot soup! Spilled it again. These are dangerous people, Fred. -Let me do the talking. -You bet. I'll keep my eyes peeled and my lips sealed. What do you want? -We're. uh-- -Frederick Frederickson the Fourth. This is Hiro. We're very busy, dangerous types and we don't like to be kept waiting. What happened to letting me do the talking? Now, you and I both know that was never gonna work. Hiro, we're going to Noodle Burger. You wanna come? -(gasps) -Go Go: What happened? My body ran away. All: Baymax! You're back! Wait, why are you in the computer? And where's Hiro? Hiro can be found here. That's Good Luck Alley. Why do they call it Good Luck Alley? Good luck getting out alive. (gasps) That's Baymax's skeleton? It's so... naked. It's naked Baymax. And you must be Yama. -We had a deal! -Oh, Zero, did you really think I was going to give you back your robot? That was my understanding. Did nobody else think that? -Ow! -Hey. Great. No windows, no air ducts, and one locked door. Looks like we need to break out of a super secure, high-tech safe room. Awesome! How do we do that? Oh, I've got it! We could do what Dirk Dinley did when he was trapped in the dungeon of Dr. Slaughter. Get this. He fashioned a key out of a stale cracker and a single strand of his own hair. Or, we... yeah, that'll work, too. -We could just unlock-- -Come on. So after we get naked Baymax back, what's our exit strategy? You thinking fists? You thinking something other than fists? I'm thinking we run. So feet. We're gonna go with feet. Where do you think you're going? -And you're sure not fists? -Feet, Fred. Fast! Hey. Come on, let's take these two to Yama. Well, if you think about it, I did you a favor by testing your security. Thank you. Get rid of 'em! Quick question, when you say, "get rid of us," do you mean throw us out, or are you talking more of a, you know, permanent situation? Permanent. Got it. No, wait! (loud rumbling) Huh? Yeah! I knew you couldn't resist the call of superhero-dom. Hi-ya! Yeah, that's right. That's wrong! Ah! Ya! Ya! Ya! Hi-ya! (electricity crackling) Adrenaline's back! Hiro, Fred, you guys okay? -Much better now. -How'd you know we were here? Wait, were you guys out on night patrol without me? Fred, night patrol is not a thing. It's really not. Look out! That was close. Did you see how close that was? Stay here. Roger that. Nobody hustles Yama. And gets away with it? Well, looks like I just did. Ooh, that's cold. (chuckles) Did, uh, everybody-- Did you guys get that? Go Go: Hang on! Fred: Hey, it's Heathcliff! So, I'm sensing you're angry? Without my scanning capabilities, I am unable to detect nonverbal signs of anger. Are they glaring? Are their eyebrows down and together? Do you see narrowing of their lips? I got this, Baymax. Guys, I'm sorry I didn't tell you what I was doing. You could have gotten hurt. And I can't believe you stole something from Professor Granville's desk! And you helped him. And now Yama has it! Well... Double steal! -As promised. -I'm impressed. But don't ever do that again. I won't but there is still one problem. How am I gonna explain that to Professor Granville? Don't worry, I'll take care of that. Just this once. Come on, come on, come on! Yes! Hiro: Ow. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion. Hello, Hiro. He is not gonna be happy that we didn't get it. Don't worry, we got something much, much better. Dolphin-safe tuna nachos coming through! Hot plate. Really hot plate. Just keep the kitten mits on for a while, will you? (slurping) Refill alert. On it. Ketchup bottle down! On it! (sighs) Giant tray of dirty dishes! Not on it! Come on, Cass, lift with your knees. Oh, and your back. And your arms, and any other parts that-- Whoa! Wait! What? Hello, I am Baymax. Baymax? Baymax, you're back! Aunt Cass. ♪ Announcer: Are you looking to reconnect with our amazing city? The answer is San Fransokyo Metro. Over 100 convenient stations... (audio fades to static) (loud thud) Ah! Obake: Well, did you obtain the item? The item? Ah, I see. You failed. -(loud rumbling) -(Yama screams) Wait, wait, wait! I made you something better! (panting) Obake: Show me. I see... potential. Much better than that piece of scrap. No, but useful to obtain it. Do not fail this time. Ladies and gentle-heroes, since we kicked so much butt, at, well, you know, kicking so much butt, I took the liberty of designing our very own... superhero signal! Ooh! Heathcliff, hit the lights. (drumroll) Ta-da! Wasabi: "Halp?" Fred: Yeah, that's supposed to be "help." Heathcliff, did we keep the receipt? Uh, we did not, Master Frederick. Okay, so we'll just go with "halp." -People will know. -Freddie, I heart your enthusiasm, really, I do. But I had to freeze somebody yesterday. I'm not comfortable with that. Don't beat yourself up, Honey Lemon. I'm sure he thawed by now. Guys, this is no way for Big Hero 6 to talk. Big Hero 6? Really? My brain stormed an epic list of team names, and that one tested best, with an audience of me. The power of six! Come on, guys, I need at least one more hand from each of you. Come on, you know you want to. Look, Fred, it was a one-time thing, saving you two knuckleheads from Yama. I could have sworn that I heard from someone-- I don't want to name names, but it might rhyme with Bobo-- that this was just a one-time thing when we stopped Callaghan! Okay, so it was two times. And that's it, we're done. We don't need a team name. So, yeah, the team name is Big Hero 6. Everyone loved it, unanimously, I might add. -Whoa! -(thuds) I was alerted to the need for medical attention when-- No, I'm okay! I'm okay! Okay... done! Ha! Fred, I think you're going to like this. Whoa. A superhero chip. I am now capable of defending innocents and various other heroic deeds. To the power of six! Ba-la-la-la-la. Not what I envisioned, but you put your own spin on it. Great. We're not supposed to be in here. We've got to hide. I am large and difficult to conceal. I will deflate. Yeah, no time. Hmmm. Ah, comfortable. Hmm. What to do with this upperclassman lab. (chuckles) Clearly it should go to someone who follows the rules. Someone who doesn't try to pass off a robot as furniture. You can come out now, Mr. Hamada. He's not here. Now. Didn't I make myself clear when I told you this lab was off-limits? Well, yes, Professor Granville, but I-- Hello, I am Baymax. Yes, I assumed. Follow, please. Balance, Mr. Hamada. Hard to achieve, harder to maintain. One tiny wrong decision, and... (blows air) (metal clatters) Your brother did not allow himself to be distracted. Now, you could follow Tadashi's lead, or you could choose a different path, Fred: Is she pointing at me? I feel like she is. The choice is yours, Mr. Hamada! Whew! That was scary. Your heart rate is accelerating. Would you like to take a seat? Yes, I would. Your neurotransmitters indicate you are feeling tense. -(vibrating) -Shiatsu. Nice (Baymax speaking Japanese) So, Hiro, whadaya say we grab a couple of Noodle Burgers, finish up Baymax's armor and get our night patrol on? -I can't. -Okay, fine. Yaki Taco is healthier anyway, according to the Yaki Taco website. -No, look, I can't-- -If this is about the tacos, I'm open to pizza. I mean, I had it for lunch, but for you-- Fred, look, I-- I need to focus on going down the right path. Tadashi's path. ♪ Ah! ♪ (snoring) Ah! (crickets chirping) Still reeling from the bitter taste of disappointment, the lone guardian of justice continues his watch over the city. (sighs) Maybe they were right. Maybe this city doesn't need... halp. ♪ Reporter: Breaking News now. Seemingly indestructible robots have invaded Night Market Square, annihilating everything in their path. We're also getting reports of destruction on Shimomoto Boulevard. I think it would be smart for your to avoid that area. Who is behind this robo-rampage? -Oh, no. -Yama. -He bootlegged Baymax? -Baymaxes. Plural. So plural. Okay, so, a bunch of killer robots are loose in the city. -Know what this sounds like? -A nightmare I had once? No! It sounds like a job for Big Hero 6! In this reporter's opinion... You guys are gonna love the name when you see the T-shirts. The police can handle this. We can't handle this! (sighs) Let's suit up. Baymax needs his armor. I've got to finish it. I'll meet you guys. Just be careful! Come on, come on, come on. You appear to be... agitated. Yeah, the city's under attack. -And you feel responsible. -What? Your body language and lack of eye contact are strong indicators of guilt. If I had just run Tadashi's diagnostics like you told me to, none of this would have happened. Mistakes are common to everyone. (beeping) Not ones that put the whole city in danger. (shouting) (whimpering) -(screams) -I got you! (crashes) -Fred: Wasabi, one of us has to be a decoy. -Flip for it. -Wasabi: Roof or wheels? -Fred: Wheels, obviously. -How was that obvious? -Watch a movie sometime. A flipped car always lands wheels up. Come on. (grunts) (roaring noise) (whimpers) I... don't... think... I'm... cut... out... for... this! Fredzilla time! (grunts) Halp! Wasabi, are you okay? No, I'm not. I'm... great? (laughs) Adrenaline's flowing. I'm feeling it! Okay, who's next? Bring it! I said bring it! While I'm riding this adrenaline wave! Woo! Oh, yeah! Hiro, do you feel better now? I'll feel better when we beat Yama's robots. (distant crash) Hang on. Hang on to what? Yama: You, guard the door. Computer voice: Welcome to SFIT Virtual Guide. This Saturday, Muirahara Woods Fun Run. Fun! (growls) (beeping) Shh! Shh! Yama must have sent out those other bots as a distraction. -Computer voice: You are here. -Here. I know I'm here! -Where is "here"? -Guys, Yama just broke into the school. I think he really wants that thing from Granville's office. Seriously? It's a paperweight! Also, we're kind of (grunts) busy right now. Too... many... robots! Hiro, you should get out of there! No, Baymax and I will find a way to hold off Yama. Honey Lemon: We'll be there as soon as we-- (static crackles) Buddy, time to be a superhero. First, let's take out that guy. Ready? Yes. ♪ (phone rings) Whoa! Hello? -Hiro! -Hey, Aunt Cass. -I'm kind of busy. -Me, too. The Seafood Market was jammed. But I got the most amazing deal on butterfish! (passengers groaning) Great, but-- Well, I just got on the train, so I'll be home soon, okay? -Don't snack! -Okay, gotta go. Love you. Bye. Violence is not a recommended solution. (electricity crackling) Baymax! Oh, no. I am in need of repair. Ha, ha, ha! I could do this all night! You okay, Freddie? (coughing) Yes, I am, thanks to you, superhero. Wink. You can't see it, but there's so much winking going on in here. Key card? Here's my key card. Tear it apart. Uh, okay, Baymax, I need you to act like one of the bad Baymaxes. "Act" is not a command I understand. Just do what they do-- and get the paperweight. Hey, aren't you the one that's supposed to be guarding-- Oh, never mind. Just help them. What are you waiting for? Find that thing. (grunting) Ow! Oh, no. Hello, I am Baymax. -What? -I was alerted to the need for medical attention when you said, "ow." On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain? Get him. Oh, no. It's over, Zero. The name's Hiro. Waah! (electrical pulsing) Oh, no. Baymax! -Hang on, Baymax. -Hiro, you are in danger. (electrical pulsing) (powers down) So, that's why he wants it. This is not safe. If you do not let me go, you might fall. No, you'll break. No! Baymax: This was a positive outcome. Thanks, Honey Lemon. We're not losing anybody on my watch. What happened? That paperweight? It isn't just a paperweight. Wait, you guys really thought it was a paperweight? Whatever the villain's trying to get is never what it seems. That's Comic Book 101. Granville's paperweight probably has some cool untold power. But why would she have something so dangerous on her desk? Maybe one of its untold powers is holding down papers. (sighs) I'm gonna make this right. ♪ (sniffling) I always knew we'd all be together again, just like this. (sniffling) Do you need a tissue, Fred? No, I don't need a tissue. I'll be okay. You sure? Because we should probably go catch Yama. (grunting) This is not just an alloy. You could have told me. Obake: Why would I do that? You're a dog, fetching a ball. Bring me the ball. I'm on my way. But, uh... there is something else. Your ball is broken. Just a little bit. Bye. Fred: All right! What do we do now? Time to fire up that super-sensor, Baymax. Scanning for Yama. -Hiro: Nano-induction... -Of course! -Please explain. -That's what's happening inside that metal. It could amp up anything electric-powered to a dangerous level. Baymax: Yama located. There. The train station. The electric train, people! Aunt Cass! ♪ Butterfish, butterfish Better than other fish ♪ It stinks, lady! (panting) (electrical pulsing) Aah! (grunts) Train! (screaming) Announcer: Are you looking to reconnect with our amazing city? Hiro: We have to stop it before it hits Central Station. Go Go, Wasabi, cut off the engine from the rest of the train. -On it. -Wait, what?! (screaming) Wasabi, do your thing! Even with the adrenaline, I have really mixed feelings about this! (screaming) Hiro: Honey Lemon, Fred, slow down those passenger cars. Honey Lemon: It's hero time, Freddie! -Big Hero time! -(grunting) Ah! Hey! Come on! (groans) Yow! (giggles) Don't step on my dinner. It's butterfish. -It's better than other fish. -Oh, gross! The rest is up to you and me, buddy. Someone has to help. (electrical pulsing) (screaming) Magnet lock's on! Gotcha! Okay, Baymax-- Whoa! Baymax (speaking rapidly): Overcharged. Overcharged. Overcharged. Hiro: Whoa-ho-ho-ho! (groans) Reverse polarity! (grunts) (electrical pulsing) Whoa! Aah! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, Baymax! Hello. (sighs) Your heart rate is accelerated and your blood oxygen level is low. Hiro: Yeah, not bad, considering. A little too close to disaster there. But... it wasn't. We saved a lot of people... together. Fred was right all along. Yes, Fred was right all along! So, what I'm hearing is, we're all fully committed to being a super team and will sign legally binding contracts to that effect. Fred, how about this? Fred (laughs): To the power of 6! All: To the power of 6. Baymax: To the power of 6. (knocking on door) Come in, Mr. Hamada. Oh, wow. What a mess. What happened? There are many unanswered questions. Can I help you with something? I-I've been thinking about what you said. You know, about balance? Tadashi found his and accomplished amazing things. Good, we agree. But he also took risks. I mean, the last thing he said to me: "Somebody has to help." Tadashi will always be my inspiration, but I'm not him. I have to figure out how to be me, and I'm gonna make some mistakes. Yes, impatient shortcuts, dangerous risks. Oh. Well. Those are awfully specific. I have decided that working in your brother's lab will be good for you, Mr. Hamada. Really? Perhaps Tadashi's legacy will help you avoid some of those immature mistakes. Couldn't hurt. Eh, maybe no hug. Let's not. ♪ Hiro: We didn't set out to be superheros, but sometimes, life doesn't go the way you planned. The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people. And that's what we're gonna do. Who are we? Obake: Big Hero 6. (theme music playing)
