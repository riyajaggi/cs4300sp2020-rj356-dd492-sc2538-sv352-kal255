 [♪♪] (Aunt Cass humming "Deck the Halls") What does it do? - It's a snow machine. - Don't those already exist? Not one like this. It lowers barometric pressure, generating real, climate-created snow. No water pumps, no compressors. Oh, interesting. I take it you have notes.

 You could reduce that by adding insulation. - Not a bad idea. - I know! (chuckles) Okay, genius. Then how about you just hand me that screwdriver? Time for a rest run. - Ready? - Ready!

Hey Hiro, we can decorate the Lucky Cat after we close tonight, okay? I'll make cocoa, we'll sing carols? Uh, sure. That... sounds, uh, great. You know what? I'll get started while you're at school. By the time you get back, it'll be a winter wonderland. Hiro, you appear to be distressed. - Would you care to talk about it? - No, I'm-I'm fine. Don't worry. Hey, think I found my Christmas present. I'll just put this in here. Christmas presents are traditionally placed under the Christmas tree. Yeah, I know, but every year I bug Aunt Cass by figuring out what she got me. Baymax: Scanning now. No, no, no, don't tell me! That's cheating. I have to figure it out on my own, then put it back before Aunt Cass and I open presents tonight. [♪♪] - Hey, Hiro. - Hey! - Wasabi: How you doin'? - Hiro: I'm okay. I'm a little worried about this last final. We're not talking about school. Yeah, we know things are probably tough.

Today's final exam will take approximately two hours and thirteen minutes to complete. (class groaning) Happy holidays. Wait, what? - No! - (toy whirring) - I'll take that. - No, but I... Can have it back in two hours and thirteen minutes. Could I borrow a pencil? (whirring continues) [♪♪] All done! Just a moment, Mr. Hamada. I realize this must be a difficult Christmas for you. Thanks, Professor Granville. In the spirit of the season. Merry Christmas. (ring tone playing) (ring tone continues) - (beep) - Hey, Hiro. Uh, can't really talk right now. Having a bit of a situation. Mini-Max: This decorative material is confounding! I just need to know if you have my backpack. Oh yeah, sorry. I must have grabbed it by mistake. There was a present inside. Could you just make sure it's still there? - Will do. Mini-Max? - (beep) Hold, please. Fred: You sure there was a present in here? Yeah, why? Sorry, Hiro, but... it's gone. Mini-Max: I cannot hold it much longer! Mini-Max: Holidays are stressful! ♪ Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ We have to find it before Aunt Cass and I exchange presents tonight! Okay. Not much time. Where should we look? Baymax: It is likely that you lost the present between the institute and your house. Mini-Max: Excellent use of deduction! - Thank you. - You are welcome, my large huggable robotic associate! We just need to retrace your steps. Everywhere you've been What did you do first? Well, first, I was born. I remember it got really bright, really fast... Today, Fred! Today. What did you do today? - When you left SFIT. - Oh, ha, ha! Heathcliff drove me to the comic book store. Okay, let's check the limo. It's got to be here somewhere. (objects clattering) A hundred dollar bill... no. Old gum. Mmm... still good! Oh, I think I feel something! Yeah! - It feels like a bow! - Really? It is I, Mini-Max! Sorry, Hiro. I don't think it's here. You said you were going to the comic book store, right? Well maybe it's there. (brightly): ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way ♪ (slurping) Well, well, well. Back so soon? - Richardson. - Oh, yes, hello. How can I not help you? - It's about a present... - Oooh, what'd you get me this year, Fred? - You guys get each other gifts? - Of course! This year I arranged for Richardson to have dinner with Go Go. (squeals) Yay! But, it's scheduled for the same night that Richardson holds his annual Worstys. - The what? - The "Fred's the Worst" Awards. And I got Fred a signed copy of "Captain Fancy #1." - What? - Oh, oh! But he must accept it with his Lifetime Achievement Award at the Worstys. Nuts! So, wait, every year you guys get each other gifts that you can't enjoy? Well you can't have a bitter rivalry without sacrifice. All right, here's to another year of mutual tormentation. [♪♪] Ha! Gosh, I am feeling so good right now. I almost feel bad about stealing Fred's present. What present? The little one with the bow that was in Fred's backpack. That will be forty-seven dollars and thirteen cents. Wait... This isn't my... Finders keepers. Okay, Richardson, that present is actually mine. Can I have it back? - You could. If I still had it. You just said "finders keepers"! Wh-wh-where is it? Who knows.

You know, about a mean rich guy, Scrooge making his employee work on Christmas Eve. If you say so, I dunno. Are you going somewhere with this? - We've got a lot of books to sign. - (door opens) Well, if it isn't my young intern, his robot, and Ted. Wow, that hurts. To what do I owe this visit? - We actually came to talk to Judy. - Who? That would be me. Baymax: We are attempting to locate this present. Next. Next! I've wrapped so many presents today. I'm sorry. Oh, maybe it fell out on the street. More water, Mr. Krei? He keeps giving me stuff to do even though it's Christmas Eve. You have to help me. Please! (pen squeaking) Judy! This pen is not working! Judy would like to go home now. Spend time with her family. Do the whole Christmas thing. Yeah, okay? Oh, humbug! Here at Krei Tech, Christmas is just another workday. You can't work on Christmas! You're supposed to be spreading Christmas cheer! What would I know of Christmas cheer? I never got to meet Santa as a child, and I never had presents magically appear under the tree. I was always alone at boarding school while... Mama and Papa were off partying in Switzerstan. None of my friends ever invited me home. - Because you were so mean to them. - No! Yes. Maybe. I don't remember the details or their names. (crying) I've never even tasted eggnog. I mean, what is nog anyway? (loudly blowing nose) What if you met Santa? - Would you let Judy go home? - (continues blowing nose) You know... Santa? - Ho. Ho. Ho. - (ringing bell) (gasp) Santa! Baymax: Would you like some eggnog? (happy squeal) Yes, ha, ha, yes! A thousand times yes! Baymax: And what would you like for Christmas, 44-year-old man? Oh, we're still doing this? Oh, this is a lot of pressure. Well... obviously a pony. (gleeful laughter) Oh, and my own private island! Actually, I already have several of those. But I will take one for my pony. (laughing) Oh this is... this is fun! That's what this is, this feels like fun! Lookit, I'm beaming with yuletide cheer! I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the years! Judy! Judy, what are you still doing here? My heart is honoring Christmas. Go home! Baymax: Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la. Krei: I'll just stay here. Alone. (crying) Uh, would you like to come to dinner at Nana's? (quietly): Please say no, please say no... Really? I would love to meet this "Nana." And sing carols and bake cookies, maybe some "nana" bread? Ha, ha! Whatever, just keep serving me that disgusting eggnog. - Great. - Thank you. Thank you. (crying) I will never be able to repay your kindness! Now go ahead, bring the car around. Come on, we better get going. Hiro, wait. My new cookbook. Krei-vings. See how that works? My name and... anyway, I signed it for you. Also, that thing you wanted. I did see it. Wait? The present?

(gasps) Why didn't you tell me? You requested I not to tell you anything about the present. It's from Tadashi and now it's gone. [♪♪] Hiro, I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry. - I'm the one who took your backpack. - It was an honest mistake. Look, I never should have taken the present in the first place. - We can still get it back. - Wasabi: Yeah. Baymax, can you scan for Noodle Burger Boy? I have located Noodle Burger Boy... here. That's Steamer's Lair. Why would he go there? Let's suit up and find out. (heroic): ♪ Jingle bells Jingle all the way... ♪ Everybody be careful. Mm-hmm. There's no telling what kind of crazy, deranged, evil scheme those two have cooked up. Fred: We go in one three.

Blech. - Sue: I heard that! - (nervous chuckle) (squeal) Is that baked brie? - Is this really happening? - Ooh, peppermint bark. Hey, uh, Noodle Burger Boy? Happy holidays! As long as we're in a truce... that's mine! Oh, sorry, mister! But if you want this present, you'll have to play for it! Play? Holiday gift exchange! Ah-ah-ah! No present, no play. Krei's gift!

Thanks, Honey Lemon! - (whooshing) - Aaah! All I want for Christmas is your two front teeth! Aaah! Oops, Grandma got run over. Oh! (grunts) Please don't hurt me. I don't have any powers. Oh!
