 There's my little guy. How you doing? - You eating enough? - BRYCE: Mom, I think I fucked up my bowtie. In a minute, dear. I am talking to your brother. Why are you so dressed up? - Don't tell him. - Semiformal. I'm going with Mikaela, my girlfriend. - You have a girlfriend? - Mm-hmm. She's really nice, and she's got a little sister that was the age you were... (EXHALES) that you were when...

 - (CRYING) - Mom, it's been six years. - My 19th birthday's in three months. - I know, - I just, I just... - Talk to him later? She's gonna be here any minute. - Okay. - Jesus. MOM: I got to go, sweetie. But I'm gonna call you right b... (SIGHS) ERNIE: You know, Ingrid, normally, couples therapy works best when there's just one therapist. It's only divorce attorneys that you both need your own. I-I want to be open-minded, but I just don't feel comfortable opening up to a CGI dog with only a master's degree in social work.

 (ERNIE GROWLS SOFTLY)  THERAPIST: Yes, we looked you up, Ernie Lampsterman. (STAMMERS) Wow. Hope you guys are happy. Ingrid, would you like to share what's upsetting you about Nathan? He's just so... You are constantly pulling away. I'm trying to make this work, but you are so distant. Look, I'm not trying to be. Okay? But sometimes, it feels like I don't have my own life anymore. You know? I'm-I'm just this plaything for Ingrid, there when she wants me. - That's not true. - You control all my purchases, what I do, what I eat. (GASPS) Ooh. The skinny jeans came in. See? She's literally dressing me like a doll. I'm sorry, okay? I thought the skinny jeans would look good on you. So I'll just return them. Personally, I love the skinny jeans. Thank you so much. I can feel my pulse in my thighs. ♪ ♪ (CLACKING OVER VIDEO) It's hard for me to let you win if you won't take your turn. Whatever. I don't care. - Okay. What's going on? - My parents won't update my avatar. It's like I'm repeating sixth grade over and over again. I was born 18 years ago, and I don't have ball hair. Aww. I mean, they want to keep you the way they remember you. Then there's this. My little brother going with a girl to some semiformal dumb-shit dance. This is his second girlfriend. He's lapping me. Hey, it's not a race. Most men don't get that. DYLAN: Hey, girl. You looking damn fine. WOMAN: Excuse me? Did somebody lose their child? (MOUTHS) See what I mean? If I had the body that went with my age, - I would wreck that ass! - NORA: Okay, okay, you need to calm down. I get that you're frustrated, but you can't come on that strong. If I came on as strong as I feel, I'd pound a hole in the fabric of Lakeview. Sometimes I'm glad I'm sitting safely behind this screen. Nathan was dying, okay? His vitals, they were fading, and-and my grandma lives in Lakeview. Right? So, uh, so all of the pieces just sort of fit together in this really nice way. See? Without Ingrid, you wouldn't even be here today. Yeah, well, Fran said my vitals were starting to go back up right before I uploaded. That's not true, is it? With deep respect, Fran is a moron. Just tell me if it's true. I don't know. You don't know? I'm... Maybe. I mean, I don't... I don't know. I-I... I-It could be true. I-I noticed something was going up, but-but I didn't really know what it meant. What the fuck, Ingrid? I'm dead. (STAMMERS) I didn't want to lose you. - (STAMMERS) - No. You didn't care if I died, you just didn't want to be alone. God... Pants! - (DOOR CLOSES) - Okay, well, I have you for another 20 minutes. Sorry. Yep. (SIGHS): Oh, fuck. That's mine. Pay up, son. Take it. Hey! Hey, there. Uh, do you want to join in on this action? Guess what? I'm not even supposed to be here. She's with someone, thank you. Can it. My vitals were going back up. - Ingrid saw and... - I said she's with someone, asswipe. Take a hint. NORA: Whoa. Settle. Geez. I think Nathan just heard some disturbing news. - Yeah, you think? - Nobody feels like they should be here. Do you think I wanted to fall into the Grand Canyon? (CHUCKLES) Wait, that's how you died? They should expect people to try and break the glass floor. They should design for it. I saw that video. You dabbed on the way down. Well, yeah. That's how you get the likes. See? You two cool guys can be friends. NATHAN: Aww, thanks, Mom. Hey, kid, you want to hit hit the Search Bar? I want to put something on Ingrid's tab. Bourbon, neat. Root beer, cold. Let's go. LUKE: Swipe right. Beautiful teeth. Oh, Sascha. Hello, there. (COMPUTER CHIMES) No. God, no. Are you on Nitely? - (EXHALES) - Nitely is only for living people to hook up with one another. No living woman wants to hook up with your dead, catfishing ass. Okay, okay. Geez. I was just browsing, for old time's sake. A guy can look. I'm watching you, dead boy. (INHALES) Yep. Yeehaw! Let's go, let's go! - Oh, you're cheating. - Faster, faster. What is happening? - (WHOOPS) - (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) That was dope. - Again. - (WHOOPS) Let's go. Voice mail for customer service employee 11-55-C. - (WHIRS) - (COUGHING) Hey, honey. It's Dad. I'm at Cuomo Memorial. (COUGHING) Damn lungs again. Thought I'd let you know. - My gosh. Dad. - You should go to him, right? Uh, I'm supposed to be taking care of Dylan, uh... No, no. Don't worry about him. I got this, okay? - Go to your dad. - DYLAN: Yeah. Do what you got to do. - We cool. - Okay. Thanks. T-This is, this is such a big help. Uh, take some Lakeview Bucks just in case. (CHIMING SOUNDS) Oh, ho, oh... Buddy, buddy, I matched us with two nines. - What are you talking about? - I made us fake Nitely accounts, and we got these swipe-rights in no time. Hot, spicy. I'll take the tall one. Dude, you're, like, four. I'm showing my wingman. I-I can't. I'm on babysitting duty. I'm helping my angel with a personal emergency. And also, Ingrid. We're supposed to meet them on the hotel floors. That's where the living meet to party in VR. Uploads aren't allowed on hotel floors. Thanks, Sheriff Short. That's why we're going to the Grey Market first, to pick up a hack to force our way down. Grey Market? Hell yeah. - Take me. - (SCOFFS) Yeah, right. - Wait, what's the Grey Market? - Oh, a hacker like you would love it. You can get anything there. No rules. Oh, that is intriguing, but I can't. I made a promise. Come on, Nathan. Don't be a loser. Please! Come on. Please. - Nathan, look at me. I need this, man. I need it. - Come on. - Please. I need it. - DYLAN: Please, Nathan. - Come on. Please, man. Please. - Come on. - Please, please, please! - Please, Nathan, come on. - DYLAN: Please, Nathan! Please! - Please, Nathan, please? - Please, Nathan, oh, my God... - For God's sake! Nathan, just take them. Okay, fine, a quick trip. - Yes! Yeah! - Yes! (WHOOPS) (BOTH BABBLING) NATHAN: So where exactly are we going? - Off the map. I guess you'd call it the dark web. - Uh-huh. Yeah, there's this super secret place you can pass through the hedge. Can you spot it? (GROANS) Gentlemen, can I help you? This area's off-limits. No, no... sir? Sir. Little sir, no, seriously. Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown. No, no, seriously, it's dangerous. Mr. Brown? Whoa. Horizen will not be held liable for any avatar corruption! We're not playing! (STAMMERS) I-I could get through this hedge any time I want. And I just don't want to today. (BEEPS) Okay. Nothing to be scared of here, guys. Hmm? What's that, Dylan? You think we should hold hands so nobody gets lost? (CHUCKLES) Fine. I didn't say anything, wuss. What's with the numbers? You have, like, a lot of questions. It's for our locator pings. Lakeview keeps track of all uploads by pinging us every hour. If we're off the map, we don't ping back, the system assumes - we've been erased. - Then what? I heard your avatar disappears and your consciousness wanders the Grey Zone for all of eternity. So let's hurry up and get there, huh? - (BUZZING PASSES BY) - (SIGHS) If I'm an invisible consciousness, I'm gonna go up people's noses and out their butts like a fart. I like the way you think. There. That's it? (LAUGHS) (WHOOPS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) LUKE: Oh, man. This is sick. Just see! 'Sup, kid? NATHAN: Uh-oh. VENDOR: Bad smells for sale! - Fuck off. - Bad smells for sale! - Hey, boys. - We got sweat, dirty pennies and a hot chick's morning breath. All fresh. Sure you're 18? 18 and three quarters, dickbag. - (GRUNTING) - (GROANS) (GRUNTING) LUKE: Here we go. Two Lakeview elevator hacks. Ooh! Trying to party with some living ladies, huh? (GIGGLES) I'll throw in some antivirus to be safe. Can you make it quick? We're on a time crunch. Can I go look around? This is the most action I've ever gotten. I mean, we do have 40 minutes. Just stay close, okay? We're always watching you. VENDOR 2: Celebrity memories! I got real celebrity memories here, people! Pulled moments after upload. Drake pooping. The sad end of Sir Justin Bieber. Huh? Hey, hey. I got Penélope Cruz in the shower. Huh? This is stupid. You're stupid. Those pants are dumb. What do you keep in there, Teddy Grahams? (CHUCKLES) Fuck off, you fat nerd. Bite me, Tiny Tim. - Oh, easy, easy, easy. Okay. - Come on! -(LAUGHING) Come on. Come on. How would you like to hack into a living person's wrist phone camera? Ten seconds for 100 coins. Interesting. Are you kidding me? I've seen 100 different sex bot shops, - and this is where you want to go? - Okay. How 'bout Jamie Arpaz, my old business partner? 2-1-3-5, ampersand sign, 7-5-3-2-8-1-9-2. MAN: So, you see, the best part is, the design costs nothing because the uploads build their own homes. - WOMAN: How? - As Josh said, my software is unique and proprietary. Huh. What is he up to? We got 12 minutes left. Let's roll. Where's the kid? Oh, shit. He was right here. Dylan? Dylan?! (CHUCKLES): Man, I can't believe your angel trusted you. (CHUCKLES) - Dylan! Dylan! - Dylan! Dylan! (MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY) (INDISTINCT P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT) AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Hello, visitor. The patient is suffering from chronic vape lung. Noncontagious. Mr. Antony, we simply can't keep meeting like this. (CHUCKLES) Well, I don't think we will be much longer. - (COUGHS) - Dad, come on. I don't want to run up a-a stack of bills like when Mom died. Y-You had to skip college. Can you imagine me as a lawyer? (CHUCKLES): Yeah. It was your dream. You went as Gloria Allred three Halloweens in a row. (CHUCKLES) I just want you to be happy. It's been nothing but sickness and crap for too long. We're still here. Together. Right now. That makes me happy. (COUGHING) Oh, I hate to leave you alone. Well, you wouldn't if you uploaded. Oh. Oh, I've seen the commercial. I go on dates. I mean, there's a guy I might like. - Ooh. - Okay. There's nothing yet. We're just friends. It's kind of long-distance. How long-distance? Long. What's he do? He's in computers. Is he there for you? I mean, can you really count on the guy? Yeah. I think I can. - Dylan! - Dylan! Dylan! - Fuck! - Dylan! Dylan?! How could you have brought a child here? What is wrong with you? Dylan! Dylan?! Dylan?! - DYLAN: Yeah, man! (LAUGHS) - Dylan?! There. There, there, there. There. (GROANS) You didn't tell me this would hurt. You want hair where you were telling me, you better hold still. - Hey, Dylan, we got to go. Now. - In a minute. No, now. You'll just have half a tattoo. It's not a tattoo. - It's a puberty power-up. - A what? What the hell does that mean? Just some code to age up his avatar. I got it off a top-notch Russian hacker. Next time he falls asleep, he'll wake up with adult parts. And... done. (GROANS) - Great. Okay, we are one ping away from annihilation. - Come on. - Uh-uh-uh-uh. 600 Facebook Libras. Fuck. Stupid pants. - Great. Okay. - DYLAN: Hey, see if those Nitely girls have a friend for me! - NATHAN: Like a babysitter? - DYLAN: You motherfucker! Cafeteria's that way. Oh, actually, I had a question about scanners. Do these machines ever damage memories by accident? Never. They're, uh... glorious, really. You can watch the life of a squirrel beat for beat if you put one in this machine. Not that I ever have. Uh, what if I happen to know, uh, an upload with damaged memories? Then it wouldn't be the machine's fault. It's always whoever designed the avatar. Those low-wage clowns, they mess up all the time. Well, actually, I made the avatar. Oh. Are there any other possibilities? Somebody somewhere is probably... (CHUCKLES): Up to some kind of fuckery. Well, is there anything I can do to fix the memories? I used .Mem Restore, and I got a couple watchable. - .Mem Restore. - Mm-hmm. Why not just throw your money directly down the toilet? The only consumer app that isn't shit is Memboost Turbo. I have a download card you can use. It'll work on any device. Oh, thanks. Are you sure? Of course. This is the longest conversation I've had in years. - LUKE: Go! - (PANTING) DYLAN: Guys! (PANTING) (GRUNTING) Go, go, go, go. (PANTING) Oh. Oh, okay. Nap time. I'll drop him off at his room. Don't be long. Here's your hotel level pass for 4006. Meet you at the bar. And don't change out of the skinny jeans. You look amazing. Stop. You think so? Yeah, you're all tuckered out, huh, buddy? You had a big day. - (SNORING) - Ew, ew. Drool. Drool, drool. Gross. (GROANS) Yuck. (SIGHS) Okay. And, uh... I don't know. People do this, right? Here you go. (GROANS SOFTLY) This is great. Perfect. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (MUZAK PLAYING) - (WHISTLES SOFTLY) 4006. Oh, I'm sorry. Uploads are not allowed on the hotel fl... - (BEEPS) - (GRUNTING) And away we go! (RATTLING) (SHOUTING, WHOOPING) - (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) - (CHATTER, LAUGHTER) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) DJ: ♪ Can I get an "H" ♪ ♪ For Horizen? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I say, "A," you say, "I" ♪ ♪ Artificial DJ say, "Here we go" ♪ ♪ Let's go, let's go, let's go! ♪ (CHUCKLES): Yes! Hey. All right. - Uh-huh. Hi. Mwah. - Hi. And, uh... and you are for my friend. Do you want a drink? (SOFT RINGING) (TRILLING) ♪ ♪ My buddy will be here any minute. You want to dance? I don't want to leave Chloe alone. Of course. Cool. Yeah. Hey, so tell me more about your coworker who uses your mug. That shit is bananas. - Yeah. Karen. - God. - She's a bitch. She's... - Karen, learn to read. - Your name's on it. - The worst. Yeah. (SIGHS) Shh. (CHUCKLES) - (NATHAN WHISTLES) - I'll be right back. (SIGHS) You didn't tell me your dad was this rich. I'd have proposed by now. INGRID: And powerful. President Reagan gave this to my dad when he was in college. It's his favorite thing in the world. That's including me. (NATHAN CHUCKLES) This bottle's old enough to be my grandfather. Mm-hmm. He was saving it for a special occasion. (CHUCKLES) (KISSING) ♪ ♪ Hey, um, Batia? Do you ever go on my computer? That is serious accusation. I will take lie detector. Oh, you-you don't have to. I-I was just wondering 'cause I-I seem to have lost some files in this one folder. I will take lie detector. No one can control their skin. Yeah. Okay. Dude, where are you? Did you know that Sascha got downsized to a smaller cubicle because her boss has it in for her? Because I do. I'm doing all the heavy lifting myself. Grooming tools down. I'm not grooming. I'm taking a shit. Hurry up. (SNORES, EXHALES) (YAWNS) (EXHALES) Oh. Yes. So it begins. (CLEARS THROAT) First stop: The ladies by the pool. (EXHALES) (CHUCKLES) I like your style. Yo, thank you. Can I help you with something? That's what I fucking thought. Oh, dear. Um, uh, you may need to cover up, please? - What the fuck? - Perhaps you'd be more comfortable... I'm going for a swim, dork. - Please, j-just... - Get off. Angel! And then, with no warning, he's like, "Leesha", - "the bichon frise has been sick all week." - (ALERT CHIMING) I'm like, "Yeah, 'cause you keep feeding it Raisinets." - DYLAN: Get off! - (CONCIERGE GRUNTING) Dylan? - Just... - Get the fuck off of me. Oh, shit. Shit. Hey. I trusted you. Who's this, now? This is Dylan. - What? - NORA: Yeah. Heard all about your little field trip to the Grey Zone. Turns out the puberty patch was female. - Oh. - You guys effed up. Dude, biology 101. It says "XX," not "XY." How am I supposed to know? I thought it just meant he's gonna be, like, extra, extra manly. - Oh, hey... - Haven't you ever seen boobs before? The... They're for feeding babies. - Yummy. - Oh, grow up. Creep. - Yikes. I'm-I'm really sorry. - ALEESHA: Mm. This has Luke's greasy fingerprints all over it. Where is that Hurt Lockin' asshole? Found him. And he's right where he's not supposed to be. (EXHALES) I'm really sorry. Oh, fuck. - What are you doing? - What does it look like? I told you to keep your dead ass away from our living visitors. Ma'am, do you know he's an upload from our permanent resident floors? She doesn't care. She thinks that's hot. - Wait, what? You're an upload? - ALEESHA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, that's fine. That's totally cool. I can totally handle that. That's not weird. That's not weird. (CLEARS THROAT) No, it's not weird. Will you excuse me just a min... (CLEARS THROAT) (SASCHA COUGHING AND RETCHING) Get your ass back upstairs. So, do you want to, you know, make out? WOMAN: Greg, dinner! GREG: Coming, Ma! Just fucking with some dead people. Wh-Wh... Why? Well, this was the move of a true douchebag. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dude... ette. NORA: Poor kid. Dylan, we all know that gender's a spectrum, so if this is your way of, you know, telling us that this body is more in line with your identity inside, that-that is just great. And I'm sure we both support you. - Yes, of course. 100%. - No. I can tell this is not me. Can you just change me back, please? Okay. But it's gonna take me hours to reprogram, so are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. - (SIGHS) - Right. Well, next time, I'll leave you with real grown-ups. Oh, how's your dad? Fuck. Smooth. Those golfers staring at me was definitely the worst part. Yeah, I can imagine. I bet a lot of girls feel that way sometimes, too. You know, when guys are only interested in their bodies. I guess everybody wants to be treated like a person. NATHAN: Yeah. Oh... fuck, I missed your titties? They're the talk of the lobby. Hey, not cool, man. Oh. Sorry. My bad. Why do they have to program me so horny? I'm sure they'd remove it if they could. (EXHALES) Then why make our angels so freaking hot? Mine has legs that just won't quit. You know, I was only a woman for a couple of hours, but that's demeaning. I bet when you didn't have legs, you didn't want that to be the only thing people noticed about you. Okay, PC Police. I'll come back when you're fixed. DYLAN: You know, I may still only have a 12-year-old's body, but I'm more mature than Luke. Definitely. But that's a pretty low bar, kid. Call Josh Pitzer. Hello, Mr. Pitzer. Just confirming we're still on for 5:00. This is the third time you've called to confirm. We're still on. I'll see you in two minutes. Huh. (CHIMES) Car? Car, what-what are you doing? Stop. Stop. Obey me! (TIRES SCREECH) (RUMBLING) The heck? What's that noise? We're on wood? No, no, no. Car. Car. Car, stop! Oh, thank God. Call for help. Okay? Call your mom. Something is wrong with my car, okay? Did you hear me? Call for help. Yeah. Or... No, no, no. Don't move. Damn it! No! Stop! - (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - Wait, wait! No! Stop!
