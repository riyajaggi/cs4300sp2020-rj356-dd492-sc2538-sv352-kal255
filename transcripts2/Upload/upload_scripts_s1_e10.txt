 Good morning, Mr. Benson. Good morning, Ms. Kannerman. Good morning, Mr. Choak. Oh! Finally, a decent bagel! Thank you, Horizen! Oh. Hello, Nathan. You don't have to answer me yet. I'm going to count to three. Try and count with me.

 One. Two. We need to be a united front. You need to stay on script. Or maybe you need to get better at adapting. And we're partners. I don't work for you. Well, you didn't file the papers of incorporation. I did. We have a verbal agreement, and I'll stick with it, but don't push me. You bring this shit up now, after I bust my ass for the last two years? Okay. Let's not turn on each other. We both want the same thing. Do we, Jamie? 'Cause from here, it looks like you want to play the part of a tech mogul,

 and I actually want to do shit and make money for my family. I don't care who gets the credit. Okay, shut this down. They're coming. United front. Boys on the same page yet? Yeah. We're sticking with Cavern. So... small-time. - But we keep control. - Mm-hmm. Sorry, Oliver. You know what? Don't worry about it. I'll get over it. Oh, uh... you and Ingrid still on for dinner Friday night? - Of course. - Good. I'll see you then. You have a beautiful home, Mr. Kannerman. Ah. Well, thank you, Nathan. You know, there is a house for sale just down the street. I don't suppose your mom would like to live here, would she? Well, my mom can barely afford rent on her one-bedroom, so, uh... Yeah. It's too bad it didn't work out with Beyond and us. My partners were willing to go a lot higher. Well, my partner's, uh, a little stubborn. You know, Nathan, the real value of Beyond is that code that you made. Now, uh... we would be willing to pay a significant amount for just a copy. Um, well, Jamie would never go for that. No. No, I didn't think he would. Of course... he wouldn't have to know. It would have to be a very significant amount. Three. Nathan, it's me. It's okay. Nobody's listening. We got away with it. So, what did you learn? Where am I? Is this Lakeview? Yes, this is Lakeview. This isn't your first day. You remember being here, don't you? You remember me? Are you a nurse? What? Are you behind me?! I am your customer service rep. You can call me Angel. I hope we can be friends. Maybe, but, uh, I might be hanging out with some of the other paying guests. There's probably some pretty cool people here. Yeah. Miss, your attitude is very depressing. It might be like that for a while. - Get out. - But I got to get my stuff. No, you don't, or you're gonna got to get my foot in your ass. Okay. Nora, Nora, Nora. You had your chance with me, babe, but you didn't... ♪ ♪ You have a beautiful home, Mr. Kannerman. Ah. Well, thank you, Nathan. You know, there is a house for sale just down the street. I don't suppose your mom would like to live here, would she? Well, my mom can barely afford rent on her one-bedroom, so, uh... Yeah. Hey, Mr. Brown, is something troubling you? Yeah, actually, something is. You want to... you want to talk it out? - No. - You sure? Because sometimes it just helps to get things off our chest. What's going on here? The concierge software has been made a lot more sensitive since the update. Hup, hup, hup! Oh. Uh, just the concierge. Of course... he wouldn't have to know. It would have to be a very significant amount. Hey, Leesh, I, uh... I'm going home. I feel sick. So you do remember me? Yeah. No, I just told her I didn't remember 'cause I had no idea what to say. I was so fucking embarrassed. Thank God, because I don't think I could repeat the earlier beats of our relationship. That kind of magic doesn't strike twice. It's worse than I ever could have imagined. I don't know how I can look her in the eye. Yeah, but I know you. You're not the bad guy. Maybe you went undercover to sting the bad guy. No. I wish. Jamie and I had a fight about what to do with the company. I thought sneaking the code to Kannerman was the best way to get paid for my family. Just being arrogant and dumb and not getting it. Still, people grow, and-and you can grow better than anybody. You'd never ghost a lady. You're the kind of guy who stays and works it out. Come on, man. This is me. Hey, um, want to come check out my 2Gig room? Mm. Nah. It's just too sad. But I love you, man. ♪ ♪ You get downgraded? Yeah. Start 2Gig at 10:00 a.m. Don't bother unpacking. You'll be okay. Just don't do anything... expensive. Like thinking too hard. Just chill. Yeah, just chill. I don't want to talk to you. Wait, w... Redial. - Hey, please, please, please don't hang up. You're wasting my data plan. Good. What? Hey. I do remember you. I remember every moment we had together, every fun, exciting, interesting, silly moment. And I remember last night. Okay. I... also remember that... I used to be... a bit of a piece of shit and that, um... I screwed over Jamie, not the other way around. - Yeah, I saw. - I'm just so fucking disappointed in myself. I couldn't stand to face you. Nora, I'm, I'm really sorry. I really liked you. I really like you, too. I know. But, see, it's because that I-I really like you that... the idea of starting something and, uh... you treating me the way you treated your best friend, I... I don't know if I could get over that. I could get broken by that. What are the odds that this would've worked out between us anyway? Dating an upload, it was an illusion to begin with. Then it turned out to be an illusion of an illusion. It takes luck to upload, and I don't come from luck. Just stick to your own, you know? I guess 2Gigs don't get angel service anyway. That's weird. Do you understand? Yeah, I do. Why is my window open so much? Shit. ♪ ♪ What the fuck? Nora. Nora! Uh... All right. Where are you? Where are you? Oh, thank God. Okay, there's a creep following me. - Can you help me? - I got you. I got you. Run. Hey, buddy, just slow down. You don't want to do... Get up, Shelley. I'm not paying you to nap. Uh, redial last number. Not a great time! - He's right behind you. - I'm aware of that. Thank you. Can you call the police? No, not enough time. Help me! I'm trying! All right, there's a... There's an office building with a bank of elevators, about a half a block. 1800 Roebling. Get in the elevator. Take it to the second floor. Make sure he does not get in your elevator. Hey, who are you? Why are you doing this? I did everything they asked. Oh, that is sick. You're safe. He's not gonna follow you. I'm out. I'm out. I just wish I was there. I just want to hold you so badly. Me, too. I mean the old you. I-I don't know. Pre-update. Me, too. You used up 1.9 gigs on day one? Jesus, this life is not for you. I had to make some calls. I hope it was worth it. It was. Shh, dude. Just sit there for the rest of the month. You can't do nothing else. Nathan turned out to be an asshole. Well, he saved your life. And I would do the same for him, or anybody. I don't owe him love for that. I know. But my gut says he's a good guy. I mean, you work with angels. Maybe you're finding out that Nathan's just a real person with flaws. No, it was worse than that, Dad. I thought he was trying to help people, but he sold his dream for money, and then got murdered to cover it up. Maybe. Doesn't add up to me. Kannerman is not that powerful. I mean, he had people in your office deleting memories, and some sort of professional assassin in New York? That guy was in L.A., too. No, must be more to the story. I saw every tampered memory. Him sneaking code to Kannerman. Fighting with Jamie, the guy who fucked with his car. They all connect. I mean, somebody just sent a guy to break into my apartment and kill me. I hate that they know where you live. Noni... I have some friends that are big in the Ludd movement. What? Dad! I have to make some calls, but I can hide you in the mountains in a house completely off the grid. But Nathan is only on the grid. Well, is it over with him or not? Voice only? Are you with someone? No. Okay, look, my dad and I talked about it, and we don't think this is over. Someone's behind Kannerman, and whoever it is - has a lot of resources. - Oh. You're not the bad guy here so much. - You're one of the victims, too. - Mm-hmm. I don't think they know you got your memories back. If they find out, you'll get deleted. They came after me 'cause I helped you in L.A. We're gonna be in danger until we expose whatever this is. Mm-hmm. Why are you being so weird? Don't you have a reaction to this? You should hide. I have a safe place to go, but... I couldn't contact you. I need to know. Everything in my brain is telling me to walk away from you, but... everything else is looking for a reason not to. I haven't... felt at home in this world... since Mom died. Maybe that's why I work at Horizen. And maybe I developed a habit of expecting the worst so I wouldn't get hurt. Nora... Let me finish. But maybe that's stupid. You know, why focus on what's wrong and not on what's right? Because what's right is... I feel something for you that I just don't feel anywhere else, anytime else, with anyone else. And if I'm being honest... those moments are the only things I care about. And... if you make a fool of me and trick me, like Jamie... I'm going to have to take that risk. I love you, Nathan. Can you handle me saying that? Nathan? ♪ ♪ This is romantic. A weekend getaway. Just shut up and get me out of here. Car, Poconos! ♪ ♪ Add one gig. - I have to call her back. - Shh... It's okay, baby. Ingrid? I'm here now. Now and... forever. I uploaded for you. What?! Nathan? Nathan. Honey? Nathan! Shit. Tech support! Tech support!
