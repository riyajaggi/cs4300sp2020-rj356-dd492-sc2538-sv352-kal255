Including me, for one... That are glad you're still here. You don't even know me. Not yet, but I'd like to. I get it. You know, this isn't perfect. And maybe you were led to believe it would be, since the marketing mentions heaven, like, a dozen times. But it's kind of better, isn't it? I mean, maybe the imperfections make it more like life, 'cause life isn't perfect. But life is the most magical gift there is, and if there's God, he's amazing, because he gave us life and the gratitude and creativity to keep it going as long as we possibly can. You're good. Yeah.
