 Wow. I mean, this store doesn't even open for two days. Freeyond fever. I hear they only have enough for the first ten million uploads. And they're all reserved for single moms, the handicapped, the poorest of the poor. Better get in line fast, hon. There's thousands of stores, and when they run out, they run out. - How old is your baby? - 14 months. But this is her only chance to live forever. - This world's going to shit anyway. - Tell me about it.

 Wi-Fi speeds are so slow downtown. Wow, look. Check it out. It actually looks like a bargain. Yeah. You know, my friend was going to make something just like this. And some bad people were trying to stop the idea. I guess they couldn't. He sounds for real. Yeah, he's the most "for real" guy I've ever met. Excited for the update? Yeah, I guess. I mean, is it that big a deal? Are you kidding? - It's a huge deal. - Fuck yeah.

 For one thing, they're adding bitter, citrus and umami to our tongues. You didn't notice that we only have sweet and salty now? That's why everything tastes like kettle corn. Yeah, no, I haven't been paying attention. I've been trying to work up the nerve to break up with Ingrid. Yes! Did that guy who stole your company cut you in? - How are you affording this? - Oh, Jamie? No, I can't actually prove he did anything bad. He just won't return my calls. But, um, I think I'm gonna ask Ingrid to give me till February, and then figure something else out. After you dump her? Yeah. I'm very interested in how you see this playing out. "Hey, Ingrid, I know you were expecting "to get married, but I'd like to be free "to date someone else. And can I have $10,000?" Yes, this should be good. This update is very exciting. Lakeview 8.9 "Scirocco" represents the fulfillment of Horizen's slogan: "We are VR." So, please, customer service angels all around the world, give your full attention to these important update messages from head of I.T., Craig Munthers. I'm gonna say this real slow because it's super important. All of your uploads need to be asleep during the update tonight. Half of them are paying for trauma blocking, and the update is... powerful stuff. It will remove all blocks if they are awake, and you'll wake up to a screaming shit show that my I.T. team doesn't want to clean up. So, all sleepy... no freaky. Got it? Over here, you got it? We got it. Why we have Winter party not on Winter Day? Because they combined it with the update so they only have to pay once. Remember Thankoween? Horizen is cheap as fuck. Soon, we're gonna have to pay to take the elevator. So take stairs. Strong calves are magnets for rich husbands. I don't know if that's true. So apparently, your boyfriend's girlfriend's rich daddy is a big deal, and he called the head of Horizen, and he got you your job back. I don't know who you're talking about. My boyfriend's name is Byron. Yeah, it's quite serious. And he has no influential friends. I mean, that I can tell. Oh, so you're bringing Byron to the update party tonight? Of course. That's weird. Have you told Nathan? Why would I tell Mr. Brown? Okay, good. Keep it up, sister. You fuck up again and you're toast. Do you feel me? And good luck seeing your boyfriend again if you're not on the system. I'll give your avatar to fucking Batia! My boyfriend's name is Byron. Huh. I can't wait to meet him. I am going to go home and change. Better be quick. I made my famous pigs in a blanket, and they'll go fast. Oh, look, there they are. Yummy. Call Byron. Hi. Hey, Nora. Glad you called. No, I'm not doing anything tonight. Ingrid can erase you at any time. Unless someone else takes over the payments. Which, frankly, your mother can't afford. Sam, what about 2Gig status? Isn't that pay-as-you-go? Yeah. I mean, if you run out of money, they can always freeze you until more cash is added. Why don't you try this Freeyond that's in the news? You're broke enough to qualify. No, it's got to be Lakeview. Dream on. Bye, Viv. Okay, what are our other options? I could give Sam a roll in the hay. He only hinted at it five times. Ew, Mom, no. What about Jamie? He must have money. Even as a loan. He's not returning my calls. I don't understand that. He was your best friend. Well, one thing's for sure. You can't break up with Ingrid until you have a plan. I have to, okay. I'm not a gigolo. I'm trying to act with some integrity. Screw integrity. I was about to sleep with a lawyer to keep you alive. Sorry. Integrity is cool. Jamie Arpaz. This is Jamie. You know what to do. Bro, um... I hate to bring this up, but I'm pretty much the Lakeview equivalent of homeless. And somehow you ended up with our whole company. I'm not saying that you fucked me, but, um... I could use a hand. So call me back, all right? I need to talk. Not sure where you are right now. Maybe you go somewhere tropical for Winter Weekend. You've come a long way in a short time. Just... call your old partner. You didn't like it? No? Hi. Would you care for some pigs in a blanket? - No, thanks. - Really? It's my specialty. - Pigs in a blanket? - No, thank you. Really? Okay. Wow. Hey. Good, you're here. Ah. Hey, you like my scarf? Probably cost five mil for the drapes alone. They're not real, idiot. - Where's Ingrid? - She's not here? - Have you told her? - Not yet. Greetings, Lakeview residents and honored guests, who we hope will someday be Lakeview residents. But maybe not too soon. To celebrate the update/Winter party, we will have an egg hunt. Yes! Mm-hmm. Yes! Yes! There is an egg hidden somewhere here in Lakeview, and whoever finds it will get a million Lakeview bucks and a thousand real bucks - for their angel. - Whoo! No cheating, Angels! We'll know. So, go on, find that egg. Where could it be? Did you look under the table? Motherfucker, move! I have student loans, and Pence University wants their money, go! - Split up? - If I find this, I can be your sugar daddy, and you can get off Ingrid's account. My sugar daddy? Nothing weird, I just don't know a better term for it. I'm gonna look out by the lake. - I have a hunch. - All right, all right. Uh, I'll check the lounge. Mom, Uncle Larry, let's find this thing. - Yeah. - All right, go, go, go. There you go. I got it! Oh, it's a fucking football. Mom, wish me luck. If I were an egg, where would I be? Keep looking. Pigs in a blanket? Do you guys want some pigs in a blanket? Will you eat a pigs in a blanket? Hey. Ah... whew. Huh, more of that. Yeah, in a, in a sec. Oh. Oh, okay. What the hell, man? I know we fought about where to take the business, but, I mean, why are my memories deleted? W-Why are you avoiding me? Did you cut some kind of deal to push me out so you could sell the company to Freeyond? Did you fucking murder me? I didn't murder you. I hooked up with your girl, but I didn't murder you, that's crazy. Whoa, whoa, wait. What? You hate Ingrid. Yeah. I'm-I'm sorry. One night, I went over to her place and-and stayed over. Then she came to her senses and threw me out. Dude... I know! I know. Damn. I fucked up. If I didn't need a loan so bad, I'd have hung up by now. Look, I got three grand in the bank. I was gonna upgrade our servers, and we fucking need it, but I'll give it to you. Yeah? Okay. I can live in 2Gig for a couple months with that. We're not even, though. I know. I'm sorry. I've been feeling really guilty - about it lately, man. - Good. If Oscar Mayer ever figures out the whole download thing, I'm gonna come back and kick your ass. I'd like that. Okay. Mr. Brown. It's my last night. I'll be checking out in the morning. Oh. Shall I throw your bags into the torrent? Uh, no. I'm moving down to 2Gigs, so you can just move them there. Move them yourself. Hey, babe. Guess what? I'm upping your allowance ten percent. Happy Winter Day. Ooh. Look, I could let you keep paying for me, but my feelings have changed. It wouldn't be fair to you or to me. Okay. I don't know where you got this new dignity, but... it's making me hot. Stop. I'm sorry. Baby, you don't understand. I have to be the owner of your scan, to protect you. Wait, what? People want you out of the way. Because of what you know, or what you knew. Hold on, what are you talking about? Are you in on this? - What do you know? - Nothing. - Unless you want to take me back... - No, no, no, no. Was I murdered? Tell me! What do know? Tell me. Ingrid! Oh, God. There's a lot of people looking on the ground - all over the place. - Yeah. I know. That's where people hide Easter eggs. - Under a bush. - Well, maybe when all the chickens are pecking under the same bush, the smart chicken pecks by the water. What the fuck? Just let me look, okay? Helping or hurting, Aleesha! Leeshee, Leeshee, no more work. Turn this shit off, okay? Come to the bar, we'll have a drink, maybe do some shots, some whiskey, vodka. Do you like tequila, do you like gin? Come on and party. Oh, I can't believe this. Ingrid knows something, but she's too scared to tell me what it is. I need those memories back. People I love could be in danger. Well, this morning, I.T. made a big deal about everyone being asleep during the update. Apparently it resets memory adjustments. So I'm thinking maybe if we keep you up, you know, it would do the same. It would restore any memories anybody blocked or fucked with. Okay. Are you sure that's what would happen? No. It's a guess, but it's a good guess. Okay. Yeah, I'll risk it. All right, I need you to keep me up tonight. - I need to know what happened to me. - Okay. I-I just need to set some stuff up. All right. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Um... There's some good news, too. Um, I broke up with her. So... Oh, um, and I got you a Winter present. Um, I don't have any money, so, uh, I mean, I made it. This is, uh, a pebble from the lakeshore when I made you laugh for the first time. And, uh, this is a feather that was close to the pebble... I didn't have a lot to work with. This is stupid. No, I love it. Here. Oh, hang on. Sensation gloves. I can really feel it. It's beautiful. Oh, I got you something, too. Cool. No, you don't get it. It's an icon. I stole it from one of the I.T. guys. They use it when they're in the system. It exposes the code. See? Oh, wow. Yeah, maybe you can use it to make things better. That's awesome. Thank you. Oh, my God. I just felt you for the first time. For real. That's, um... Really nice. Yeah. Okay. Okay, go, go. - Okay. All right. - I'll see you tonight. Did you look everywhere on that thing? Yes. Duh. Maybe take a load off and have a seat on the upturned apple crate. No time! I'm in it to win it. Take a load off and sit down on the obvious crate. Stop being weird and leave me alone! God! Ugh... Yeah. Yeah, of course. I mean, the-the coverage has been terrific, hasn't it? - Freeyond is trending all over the country. No, I think it's shaping up beautifully. No, no. I think we can relax. Uh, excuse me. What the hell's going on back there? Oh, nothing, Dad! I'm sorry to bother you while you're doing your important, precious work. - You know what? I'm gonna have to call you back. - Only, I've just been dumped. Well, can't say I didn't predict that. Your maid is cleaning that up. Make her. Oh, you are such a baby! - Yes, a baby. - Yeah. Who heard what you two were planning and snuck back into the car and changed it to "protect occupant." This baby did that. Are you fucking kidding me? You. Yeah, I'm really sorry, Daddy. I love him so much and he broke my heart. The gloves are off now. Daddy... I think this is gonna be really great for you. I never said anything, because I didn't want to influence you, but I never liked Ingrid. Really? God, you hid it so well. And it looks like we have an egg hunt winner. David Choak. That's good. He needs it. Oh, for fuck's sake. Thank you, Lucy. This is truly a Winter's Day miracle. My father always said, "Heaven showers its bounty "on the prosperous, and the wealthy are the most worthy of His grace." This is for you, Father. And a thousand bucks to my angel. Not bad. I better get bigger in this update or I'm gonna kill my mom. Hey, maybe someone needs to get a little bigger emotionally. I'm not paying extra for that. Wait, there's more. I hope there's apple Brown Betty after the update. That would be dope. Cool. Lights out. Good night, Mr. Greenstein. Uh, sweet dreams, Ms. Kannerman. You have something you want to say? How could you let Choak find it? Why didn't you help me? Sorry, what was that now? You get your cash either way but I'm the one... Stop it! Whose side are you... Sorry. Nighty-night. Bedtime for bit-boys. Shut down those artificial brains. Shut them down. See you. Oh, God! You're still here? Yeah. So, where to now? My place? Uh, I don't think so. I don't get you. You've been blowing hot and cold all night. I know. Please, don't be angry. Oh, I'm not angry. Just confused and a little hurt. I care about you. About us. Well, there really isn't an us. 'Cause we just hooked up a few times. But there's a reason the Nitely app kept matching us. And I gave you your first orgasm. Oh, you gave me your first female orgasm. They're not the same. I think we're meant for each other. Wow. I don't agree. Oh. That's, um... Ouch. You know, for some reason, that's not making me want to walk away from this. Oh, God. Oh, I'm not gonna stalk you. Don't worry. But I'm not gonna give up hope, either. Look, I know how I feel, and I-I've never felt this way before. - Mm-hmm. Got it. I got it. - And that means something. So good night, and goodbye. For now. Okay, bye. - Oh. Yeah. - You... Okay. Bye. All right, is that everyone? You're all in here? Okay. Bye, Lucy. Great party. Don't want these to go to waste. So yummy. Wow, it is packed in there. I am gonna take the stairs. Oh, okay. Just make sure you're downstairs for the head count. Okay. Bye. Happy Winter's Eve! You're all getting bonuses. Aw, wouldn't that be something? Okay, so seriously, though, I will see you tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m. sharp. And just to be clear, you're not really getting bonuses. It was just... I was being cute. That's so cute, right? Hey. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! I'm up! Sorry. - How are you feeling? - I'm tired. Come on, hang in there. Hey, hey, hey. Okay, okay. Easy. Little too much fun with those. Well, don't you want to find out everything? I mean, it's like the Botox Babies finale times ten. And it didn't even happen to me. Yeah. Yeah, I need to know if there's more to Jamie. I mean, I feel like I can forgive him for the whole Ingrid thing, but if he screwed me out of the business, I don't think I can get past that. And what if he killed you? No. He was my best friend, for a long time. I just can't believe that. Well, won't be long now. I'm gonna remember the shit out of my life, you know? Figure it all out. It's gonna be awesome. I really think my work could help people. You know? Like the 2Gigs. That'd be cool. Wow. That's better than fireworks. Yeah. Hey! Hey! There's someone awake on the fifth floor balcony! Who we got? - Oh, shit. - Okay. Here. How did you learn how to do that so fast? It's a good gift. Come here. Hmm. Must've been a glitch. Okay, boys. Turn down. Update's here. Whatever happens, I had this. I'll see you on the other side. What's going on? Um, I just have to select something, but it just occurred to me that you might wake up clean, and not remember anything that happened to you in Lakeview so far. Like Luke or Dylan or me. No. No, I don't want to do it, then. But you need to know this. Uh, let me, let me just... Nora? You should be good. You should get your self back. Restore memories and force sleep.
