 ♪ ♪ LUCY: What about under your desk? ALEESHA: I did. He's not there. - LUCY: The bathroom? - Not there, either. He might be between the couch cushions in the break room. What time exactly did you notice that he was missing? Okay, if I'm being honest, I lost Mr. Caputo's hard drive weeks ago. - Aleesha! - Before you freak out, he is in this building somewhere. I know he is. I was printing a sandwich,

 and then it got stuck between two fat cartridges, so I set Mr. Caputo down. You are not supposed to use two fat cartridges. Wait, were you the one who broke the printer, Aleesha? LUCY: I don't care! If you don't find him in 20 minutes, you are getting into his avatar and you are playing the role of Mr. Caputo until his wife dies! - On it. - And, Nora, did you ever watch the mandatory HR video on preventing scan-angel romance? I watched it, yes. - Did you understand it? - I did.

 So can you explain to me why you were found in the arms of an upload, asleep, this morning at 6:00 a.m.? I-I came in after-hours to get a jump on work, and I-I drifted off. It'll never happen again. Yeah. Okay. Because if it does, I will knock you down to a... What are you at now? A 5.8. I will knock you down to a 4.8. No! There is no 5.8. You're at 4.8. I will knock you down to a 3.8 like... that. And you, Batia, I don't know what you're pickling in those murky jars underneath your desk, but this here is a place of business. It is not a Baltic stink factory! ♪ ♪ Hmm. I don't remember you playing chess in any of your memories. Didn't think I was smart, too? (CHUCKLES) I got in trouble for falling asleep next to you last night. Oh, man. (CHUCKLES) That's brutal. - That's-that's my fault. - (CHUCKLES) No, no. It was fun. It was fine. I'm a big girl. I hate this place. You're observed all the time. No, the problem was I fell asleep at my desk and people saw me when they got to work. Oh. Well, you could set an alarm next time. Interesting. There's an alarm clock in your suite. Maybe I should remember to invite you to my suite. Maybe you should. If we were gonna do, um, that again, I would have to talk to Ingrid. You know, I owe her that. Plus, she could delete me. (CHUCKLES) Right. My name's Amy. OTHERS: Hi, Amy. My husband's been dead... Uh, I mean uploaded... For three years. I can go one month without thinking about him. He never e-mails me or texts anymore. That could be a settings problem. You have to agree to the privacy contract to receive any communications. (CHIMING) (RAPID CHIMING) Oh, shit. Excuse me. Just-just turn on auto-update. Why don't we move on to you next? Sure. (CHUCKLES) Um, my name is Ingrid. OTHERS: Hi, Ingrid. Hello. And... something's been weighing on me for a while now. I kissed my dead boyfriend's business partner. Oh, I'm sorry. Uploaded boyfriend. Well, thanks for sharing, Ingrid. We have all been there. Are you going to start seeing him? (LAUGHING) No. (CHUCKLES) I don't even like him. It was just, you know, something that happened. He was his close friend, and he came over looking for Nathan's hard drive one night after Nathan and I had had a fight. And before I even knew it, we were in bed. Uh, I thought you said kissing. And a handy, okay? (SCOFFS) Wow. Happier now? (LAUGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLES) - (THUNDER RUMBLES) - All right, just pick one! Wow. No trash-talking Lakeview today. (GASPS) No way. That's great. Your dad... Yeah. He's visiting today. You want to say hi, maybe show him around? Uh, yeah. I... You know, I didn't have the... best luck with dads. I was the guy that kind of just waited in the car and didn't go to the door. - He's not gonna be judging you. - Mm-hmm. No, he's just there to take the tour. And maybe you can help me sell it to him. Okay. - Oh, and one last thing. - Yeah? Checkmate. - Wait, what? - See ya. Never lost a game, huh? What I said was I never played a game. You made me look like an idiot. You think I wanted to? So, I've been thinking about deactivating Nathan. Not forever. Just, you know, maybe six days a week. Or... or maybe marrying him? Tough. Yeah. Um, tough situation. Yeah. Uh, next? Jen? Ooh, ooh. Sorry. Um, I actually... I wrote a little list of pros and cons for freezing Nathan. Don't worry, Jen. This will be, like, so fast. (SIGHS): Okay. Pro... (COMPUTER CHIMES) (NEWS BROADCAST THEME PLAYS) Cavern Investments' partner Josh Pitzer was found dead last night in Inglewood. The venture capitalist and nine others were apparently taken in by a counterfeit upload scam, paying $1,000 each to have their heads burned off by a fake scanner. I forgot to say that footage could be disturbing to some viewers. (DOOR OPENS) (EXHALES) Josh Pitzer ring a bell to you? Nope. Oh, wait, does he design jackets, like, really fitted, with embroidered leather? God, sometimes... No. One of your damaged memories was selling Beyond at his office. I talked to him last week, and... he died yesterday. Oh, man. You think it's connected? Uh, yeah. I want to do some snooping and see if someone did break in to your head. Are you cool with that? And find out who killed me? Nah, I'm kind of over it. Wait, what? Yes, of course. Please. ALEESHA: If you want to be a detective, can you help me find Mr. Caputo? - Shh. - Just... be careful, okay? (GASPS) Oh, my God! - You found him? - No. - Are you okay? - Yes! My dad's in the store. Comfortable? Oh, yeah. I'm loving every minute of it. Wait, what are you... What are you doing? I'll do it, I'll do it. Thank you. I won't be long, Laurie. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DOG BARKS LOUDLY) ERNIE: You seem anxious. Take a seat. Hup-hup-hup-hup-hup-hup-hup. (GRUNTING) Dad? Are you here yet? It's me, Noni! - Noni? - Shut it. - (CHUCKLES) - (EXHALES) Dad! Would you like to buy some Orbit gum? I said no to your stupid gum! Chew on this! Oh, sh... Gum. Gum. - Oh, I made it worse. - Gum. Gum. (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) Pro. If I freeze Nathan, I can see how things play out with the rest of my 20s and 30s. WOMAN: Okay. (CHUCKLES) Con. He'll miss his friends and family who will grow old without him. INGRID: Pro. Fewer friends means more time for me. WOMAN: Okay, con. You lower your chances of maintaining intimacy with the man that you love. Pro. My AC is out, and I can't afford to fix it and get Nathan all the extras he wants without asking my dad for money. You can't put a price on love. Oh, really? Where's your husband? - Kmart Villascape. - Ew. Okay. Thank you for sharing, Ingrid. - Are you all right? - Okay, okay, I'm ready. Come on, give it to me. (EXHALES) Dad! (CHUCKLES) (DAVE SIGHS) Okay, okay. This isn't terrible. Weird, but not terrible. (LAUGHS) You're not wearing your uniform today. Nope. I just can't decide what to get. Well, you'll figure it out. If someone told me what to do, I'd do it. Mm. Honeydew melon. Sir, yes, sir. - Angel. - Yes, handsome? Oh, that's cool. Right? (CHUCKLES) Oh, hey. - Quickly, how do I look? - Really good. Oh, God. Never mind. Get out of here. Dad, this is Nathan Brown who offered to show you around today. Nice to meet you, sir. You, too. I guess. So, I'll leave you guys to it. Try to have fun just for me. - Look for the laughs like with Mom, okay? - Sounds good, Noni. Bye. Nathan, show me Lakeview amenities. I'm having trouble understanding you. I found 7,000 results for "Lakeview enemies." Oh, for Christ's sake. No, I'm just messing with you. I'm a person. Let's go. (BUZZING) Good Lord. Every day. All you can eat. - Ooh-la-la. - Mm-hmm. Oh! There's my friend Luke hanging with Mildred Kannerman. Look at them getting along. Weird. She doesn't have any color. Yeah, she's over 100 years old. I find that disgusting. Okay. Uh, or... is it beautiful, you know? Two people who would have barely overlapped in the real world can talk and become friends here. When he was born, she was 72 years old. It's inspiring. I paid extra for double-jointedness, which means I can put my avatar's legs over my head. Oh, I'm gonna jump on you like a live grenade. I could blow you off your feet. Yet somehow it works. Uh... Mm. Hey, Nathan. I like my steak rare. Wait, that's, uh... - Yep. - And there's nothing more rare than black rhino meat. (LAUGHS) They had to kill the last one to program the taste right. (CHUCKLES): Okay. Well, that's lunch. Let's keep this train moving, all right? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Choo choo! That was everything I thought it would be. - Weird as hell. - Yeah. You know, digital life extension isn't what you'd expect. It's not real life, and it's not heaven. No, it's not. You see, Nathan, when you died, your soul went to real heaven. So whatever simulation I'm talking to now has no soul. It's an abomination. Okay. Or there is no soul, you know, and there never was. And in a sense, both of our consciousnesses are simulations, mine on a silicon computer and yours on a computer made of meat, your brain. - But there is a soul. - Okay. So, you expect to be... playing a harp on a cloud or something? If I told you I knew my wife was waiting for me and the only thing I've been thinking about ever since she left me was to hold her in my arms again, what could you say to get me to upload? Dad. Nothing. So you believe in it all literally? I believe I was happiest when we were all together, and the only way for us to be together again, including Nora, is after we're all dead. Is that creepy? - Yes. - A little. Thank you! I am almost there. Well, just look out the window. I'm crossing the street. I'll be there in seconds. No, I am not late again. What do you think, I'm just leaving work right now? Well, I'm not. Ground floor. Ground floor. I don't know who said that. Hey, Leesh. Lucy left her computer on and her door open, so I think I'm gonna snoop while she's at lunch. Cover me. Okay. Okay, I'll cover you. I got you, girl. Like the female Jason Bourne reboot. I got you soon as I get Mr. Caputo. Where...? (EXHALES) "Dear Ms. Slack, "No, we can't refund the shoes you wore all winter which have extensive snow damage." (SCOFFS) This is one of the best parts OF LAKEVIEW: Memory parlor. They can turn any memory you have into a video for you, even something you barely remember from childhood. Huh. You willing to let me take a peek? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Yeah, okay. I got nothing to hide. Hmm, what should I pick? Top fails 2025? Bed-wetting compilation? Senior prom? - Oh. - I'll be nice. Show me the last time you played sports with your dad. Uh, actually, I'd rather not, if that's okay. I'd like to see the man who raised you. I think it would say a lot. - Uh... - WOMAN: Here we go. ♪ ♪ I meant something more recent. That is most recent. One... two... You ready? - Yes! - Three! (GASPS) You did it! You did it! You couldn't have done a better job, Nathan. That was perfect. That was perfect. - NATHAN: Where's the ball? - MAN: Where is the ball? - (CHUCKLING) - (GRUNTS) ("YAKETY SAX" BY BOOTS RANDOLPH PLAYING) Seemed like a good guy. I'm sorry for your loss. Oh, he's not dead. At least, I don't think he is. Not even sure he knows I'm dead, so... (CLEARS THROAT) Okay. Let's go. - (HORSE NICKERS) - MAN: Easy, girl. Whoa, girl. Whoa. What's the deal with this guy? He's everywhere. - Yeah, he's AI. - Ugh. No, I'm with you on that one. He is the worst. He definitely doesn't have a soul. God, no. Look at him. Happy trails, gentlemen. (HORSE NEIGHS) NATHAN: I mean, I was barely aware I was alive. Just kind of went to clubs and did my work. - Was a bit of an asshole. - Mm-hmm. But now, my eyes have been opened to a lot of things. I'm starting to really appreciate what I have. I mean, if you said, right now, I could go back the way things were before, I don't know if I'd do it. This experience has been that good? In some ways, yeah. I mean, I met your daughter here, and she's better than any friend I had before. Even if we last for a thousand years here, it's gonna feel short when it's over, and we're out of time with the people we care about. I think that's what really matters. (DAVE CHUCKLES) You actually have some depth to you. Maybe even a soul? At least a personality. I'll take it. (SOFT CLICKING AND WHIRRING) (KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING) Come on. Give me something. "I have proof that someone is "selling Upload memories "on the black market. "Your reputation will be damaged if I take it public." Interesting. - (GASPS, LAUGHS) - (LAUGHS) - This little piggy went to market. - (LAUGHS) And this little piggy went home. This little piggy had roast beef. - (LAUGHS) - And this... little piggy just had the best sex. (BOTH LAUGH) What is that? (WHIRRING) (WHOOSHING, RUMBLING) Oh. (POWER WHIRS DOWN) Was not me! Maple bacon donut. - (MECHANICAL WHOOSH) - Whoa. - Hey. - Ew! (MECHANICAL WHOOSH) Lovely. Now I'm Pac-Man. - (LAUGHING) - (LAUGHING): Oh! - Did we do this? - Maybe. (BOTH LAUGHING) Awesome. What a day. Okay, I swear this has never happened before. What the hell? Man, I feel like we were just starting to relate to each other as equals. Mm-hmm. You still look great. Thanks. (QUIETLY): Phew. Not in the face. (DAVE SIGHS) FEMALE VOICE: The building may be on fire. - Please secure all Horizen... - Oh, come on. All right, everyone, please remain calm. Feel free to use the fire stairs next to the elevator. Aleesha, where is Nora? Oh. Um... she just ran out. Can't believe the reflexes on that girl. (SCOFFS) (ALARM CONTINUES SOUNDING) FEMALE VOICE: The building may be on fire. Please secure all Horizen intellectual property, and then evacuate safely. Ah, come on. (POWER WHOOSHES UP) Okay, okay, okay. You know, I'm still the same guy on the inside, same person you were just talking to. Mm-hmm. (WHOOSHING) Oh. Oh, oh. Hey... there. See? Temporary. You know, what makes a person a person... Let's just walk silently for a bit. You got it. (SIGHS) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - Oh. Oh, excuse me. - Oh, excuse me. - What are you doing? I'm trying to get off this... - Oh! - Oh, this is such a... - Excuse me. Aleesha! Oh, did you ever find Mr. Caputo? I did... not. As soon as you get back to your desk, I want you to get into his avatar and take Mrs. Caputo dancing! Shit. - Run, ho! Run! - (WHOOSHES) - (SIGHS) - (TWO BEEPS) So the system went to backup? Yes, Mr. Whitbridge. For, like, five minutes. That's all. Well, what happened? Sabotage? No, nothing. It was just, you know... Blame it on the power company. It was just a little local brownout. - That's all. - You think the Ludds were involved? LUCY: If you want them to be, sir. So, how was he, Dad? Go easy on me. Well, to be honest... you couldn't have done a better job, Nathan. That was perfect. Just... perfect. Thank you. You gave me a lot to think about, Mr. Antony. Mr. Brown.

Nathan would be one of the reasons why I would've done it. So you liked him? (DAVE LAUGHS) He sold the hell out of that place. He... he-he made me see the appeal that it has. Well, what about... outside of his tour guide skills? Yeah, you've got good taste. (NORA LAUGHS) He's a great guy. (MOUTHS) I just wish you'd met him when he was alive. Um... I don't think he's a romantic possibility. It's just too hard. It's too tough. I'm sorry, Nora. Well, if you're not going to upload, can you do one thing for me? Anything. Can you say "hi" to Mom for me? Of course. (DAVE SIGHS) Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
