 We need to be a united front. You need to stay on script. NATHAN: Or maybe you need to get better at adapting. Okay, and we're partners. I don't work for you. (DISTORTS): Well, you... (DISTORTED STATIC) Okay, okay, let's not turn on each other. We both want the same thing. - Want the same thing. - Do we, Jamie? 'Cause from here, looks like you want to... What I actu... want to... (DISTORTED STATIC, HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)

 (SIGHS) What were we fighting about? W-Why won't it play? I never seen this kind of damage before. We stop now. Enhancing stressful memories, not recommended. Even for a strong man like you. Try happy memory, maybe? Like good scone. Or powerful orgasm. People do that? Every day. Okay, um... Maybe last Thursday. Uh, like, 4:00 p.m.

 You don't want memory from time you were alive? No one ever ask for upload memory. NATHAN: Don't you ever want to just run across the water - and pet that duck? - (BIRDS QUACKING, CHIRPING) You know you can walk on water whenever you want, right? You're in heaven, dude. - Just ask for these things. - For real? All I have to do is hit a button. Hit the button. ♪ ♪ (LAUGHS) You were so confident! Okay, little help here? You are my angel. Hmm. Ah. - Fine. - NATHAN: Unbelievable. Okay. - Oh! - (SCREAMS) ♪ ♪ - (BOTH LAUGHING) - Oh! Not so funny now, is it, Nora? (NORA LAUGHS) You do realize I am 100% dry, sitting in my office right now? (BOTH LAUGH) You know angel's name? S... Hmm? No, I'm... (CHUCKLES) Like, barely. Lot of memory space devoted to angel whose name you barely know. Yeah, that's just... (CLEARS THROAT) Lot of tech questions. I believe you. Super. See ya. And how does he know your name? I mean, that might be on you. Well, you screamed my name so loud the other day, he probably heard it through my microphone. Nothing is ever on me. We've had this discussion. Fraternizing with an upload is a fireable offense. I'm putting you on probation. - What? - Clear out your desk. You're suspended until further notice and access to your avatar has been revoked. Lucy, please. You're a 4.8-star employee, Nora, but sometimes, you act like a 3.6. You can go. That Clif Bar is company property. Come on. ♪ ♪ (SIGHS) Geez. Hey. What's going on with the pop-ups, buddy? You and Ingrid get that sex suit working? No. No, our relationship's never been worse. Not according to the algorithms. Yeah, well, the algorithms, they're wrong. I don't think so, man. The ads know us better than we know ourselves. Ah. Sorry, bro. No, I... (SIGHS) Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Angel? (EXHALES) How can I can help you, Mr. Brown? Mr. Brown? (CHUCKLES) Well, uh, Ms. Antony, uh, I've been getting some interesting ads. Oh. I can go into the system and limit those. Yeah, or I could just admit what's on my mind. Well, you can talk to me about... anything, um... What's on your mind? NATHAN: Um... (CHUCKLES) I didn't think I'd get this nervous. Um, well, we've been friends for a while now, right? I guess we have. Okay, and, um, I mean, I haven't spoken to Ingrid yet, but I just feel like I need to get this out. I think about you a lot. And I mean, I'm not crazy right? You feel the same way. So I just think that we should both admit it and... Wow, you look... you look really pretty today. I meant to start with that. I should... - Go on. - Okay. Well, um, I mean, I know it'll be difficult for you because, you know, I'm an upload and you're alive, with your entire life ahead of you. And-and I don't have... I have no right to expect or demand anything of you, but I also can't help how I feel. - So... - I'm sorry, but... - Yes? - No. No. No? No. No. No. Um... I... I'm not offended. 32%... of scans develop attractions to their angel. - Sorry, what? - We consider these feelings... to be a testament to our... superior customer service. (CHUCKLES) Is-is this one of your pranks? 'Cause... I'm not really getting it. It's not. Sorry. Wow. Um... (CHUCKLES) That is so embarrassing. Um... I... And I just made things really weird, so just... uh, forget I said anything. Well, consider it forgotten. Bye. (CHUCKLES) She's coming back. She's not. What the fuck? Hey, should I get a pixie cut? (SIGHS) Hey, Mom, I want to see other heavens. Sweetie, is-is something wrong? - No, I just need to get out of here. - Oh. - Did you have a fight with Ingrid? - Spare change? No, I don't have any change. Just go away. It's not always about her. Okay? Just get in touch with an afterlife agent. I'd like to see other places with you. Gosh, they're so expensive. I'm sure you can find one in our price range. - Okay? Please, I need to do this. - Oh... - Hey, behind you. - Spare some change? -Oh. (SIGHS) Thanks. Sweetie, I'll try. Okay? I love you. (PHONE RINGING) KENDRA: Nora. You still at Horizen? - Send Lucy my worst. - (CHUCKLES) How's AT&T;&T;? Ugh, it's good. When a customer's rude, it's nice to know I can still look forward to their death. Hey, could you do me a quick favor? Uh, and uh, switch off call-record, if you don't mind. - (KEY CLICKS) - Of course. What's up? I need you to look at the phone records for a guy named Josh Pitzer in L.A. He worked at Cavern Investments. Okay. Service recently terminated. Uh, can you tell me about his final phone calls? Uh, outgoing to a Francis Booth. She never answered. He then followed with a text message to some unknown number. It just says some numbers. 10-55-6. Wait, that's Nathan's upload ID. Oh, who was the unknown number? Just says "blocked." That could be the killer's phone number. W-What? What's going on? And who's Nathan? If I get fired for this, I swear to God... Wait, hold on. There's someone outside. Oh, God. Okay, bye. Hey! Get the fuck out of my veggie stash. You're not usually here. Yeah, I got suspended. Give me your resume, then. And I'll edit it up for you. (SCOFFS) (GRUNTS) NORA: Fuck you. Are you sure you want to leave Lakeview? I can offer you discounts on Jacuzzi visits and a free protein on all your salads. What, now you tell me? No. No, I got to go. All right, well, remember, Mr. Brown, Horizen isn't liable for any damage to uploads while they're outside of Lakeview. So please be careful. Has your caretaker purchased a safety case to carry you around in? Yeah, I'm sure my mom's on it. Let's hope so. All right. Go! Go, go, go, go, go! (EXCLAIMS, SCREAMING) And you're sure you don't want the protective case? This hard drive will be the only copy of your son in existence. I'd recommend a case. For $40? No thanks. Yeah, well, the case is bullshit anyways. Good call. Oh... (CLICKS TONGUE) Is this my business, though? - Leaving the system? - I know. Aleesha, I-I think there may people out to kill him. I knew you would overreact. I-I've got to warn him. How? You're grounded and he's on the move. I'll go to L.A. Okay, well... I have a hook-up at Frontier-Spirit-United. Are you willing to fly Economy Minus? It's a 30-minute flight. I'll suck it up. FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Welcome to Frontier-Spirit-United. Thanks for trusting us again. Now that we're safely airborne, feel free to adjust your seats to maximize your comfort and convenience. - (CHILD COUGHING) - (FARTING) - (CHICKEN CLUCKING) - (NEARBY SNEEZE) (HEAVIER COUGHING) - (BABY CRYING) - (DOG BARKING) (ROOSTER CROWS) - Hello? - Mm. (CHUCKLES) Welcome. Oh, my gosh. Can I help you? Uh, yes. (DOOR CLOSES) My son... Nathan, would like to tour some new digital life extensions. Of course. Hey, Nathan. What's up, buddy? (CHUCKLES) I know he can't hear me. I just like to do that. - Oh. - So, where's he coming from? Lakeview. Lakeview? (LAUGHS) What is he, 90? We will get him something better. Sit. Hmm... you got a safety case for him? I got a special sale. Thank you, no. You sure? Somebody spills a slurpy on that dude, he's toast. That's what happened to these guys. Well, I... I'll-I'll think about it. Okay. (HUMS A TUNE) Okay. (RATTLING, THUD) Where to first? The delightful beaches of Apple's Cove? The luxurious nightlife of Panera Facebooks' Aeon? D-Don't I need to put on VR goggles? Oh, well, we're not going VR. We're going IR. It's like a hybrid. And you don't need glasses. Augmented Reality? That's AR. This is IR. It's like a hybrid. And it's local. - Oh. - You know, it could've been bigger than VR if a lot of things hadn't gone wrong. I put it in ten years ago. I really thought it was gonna be big. (QUIET LAUGH) Let's go. ♪ ...gonna be, I just want to play ♪ ♪ It's no wonder... ♪ Wow, awesome amazing. It's like we're really there. ♪ ...right here in Italy. ♪ Hello, Ms. Kannerman. I know you. Do we do Impact Yoga together? Did I forget my kneepads again? I'm Nora. From Horizen. Oh, yeah, you were the, um, the service tech that helped with my hug suit. See, I knew you'd seen me in my underwear. What are you doing here? Whatever. Okay, just come on up. (INTERCOM BUZZES) So... why are you here? To ask you about Nathan. I mean, when a client ejects from Lakeview we normally conduct an exit interview. Wait. Nathan's leaving Lakeview? I don't know. I assumed he was with you. But who else would've taken him? Oh. I know exactly who. Let's bring in the star of our show. (VOCALIZING FANFARE) (SCREAMS) What the... - Hey. - Jesus! Am I a lamp? Mom, where am I? High above the Tuscan Hills taking a tour of the romantic digital afterlife, Paradiso TuttiTempo. Oh, this is beautiful. Yeah, this is a great place if you love Italian-Americans. They're pretty much all here. You like Sinatra? It's pumped in nonstop. I don't like Sinatra. Well, then this is not for you. You like casinos? You're gonna love. Panera Facebook's Aeon. ♪ ♪ Ooh. (CHUCKLES) At Facebook Aeon, they know what you like because they have been collecting your private info for years. They scraped a ton of data on you just since we've been sitting here. - Pass. - No problem. How about. Nat Geo-Instagram Safari? How does that sound, Nathan? And his mom? ♪ ♪ (ELEPHANT TRUMPETS) (MONKEYS CHATTERING) I... I can barely see anything. Well, the technology is terrible. But the real thing is way immersive. You feel like you're really in the dirt, you know? You can smell the elephants. You can hear the hyenas constantly. It's all around you. That sounds really unappealing. Oh, I'm so sorry, he's not always like this. No, he is right... they can't get anyone to go there. I can get you 90% off if you lock in for 100 years. - Nope. - Ooh! Wow. - Well... - Really, Mom? (BEEP) Uh-oh, I got to take this. Hey, Ingrid, dear. INGRID: Uh, audio only? Excuse me? Put your video on. Is that a travel agency? Anything you want to tell me? You took Nathan heaven shopping without even telling me? VIV: It's his life. Let him live it. Well, no, technically, it's my life. I pay for it. (LAUGHS) What? - (VIV SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) - Okay, well, this life I gave him is gonna last a lot longer than the one you gave him. Wow. Are you kidding me? (VIV SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Excuse me? If it were up to you? Oh, Viv, if it were up to you, he would be real, old-school super dead. (LAUGHS) ♪ ♪ You'd have to go and visit his grave all the time and you'd still probably never invite me. (QUIETLY): Okay. ♪ ♪ (INHALES) INGRID: He would adjust a lot faster if you weren't always telling him how hard it is to adjust. You know what, whatever. Just drop a pin and I'll meet you there. Come with me. We got to beat traffic. You okay? Huh? You can let go of the door now. Oh. Sorry. It's just not a lot of self-driving cars in New York. Oh, they're super safe. Usually. I don't get it... Why did they send you all this way? You know, Horizen really cares about customer service. (LAUGHS) I don't know. I could tell you some stories. But you seem nice. And just so you know, I totally support raising the minimum wage. Thanks... (SIGHS) Wait. Is that the Baby Botox fantasy playground? You Tox, too? I'm obsessed. Oh, I could watch Sonia throw up on Hunter all day. Oh, my God, the... (BOTH IMITATE RETCHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, my God. I have so much hot goss, by the way. I shouldn't say this, but my sister's nanny is actually friends with Sonia's nanny. - No. - Mm-hmm. - I mean, Sonia's out of control. - Out of control. It's insane. Guess how much juice they let her drink in a day. - Like, 12 juice boxes. - What? Pound it, pound it, pound it. That's crazy. (CHUCKLES) Well, this is a disgusting part of town. - Are you coming? - Yeah. Come on. Look at the color of that water. Ooh, can we see in those huts? Not with IR. Think how much harder that would be to do. You have to fly a drone in there... Impossible stuff. (DOORBELL CHIMES) Holy shit. I got another customer. No, you don't. - Greetings. - Ugh. What is this? Oh, baby. Hi. - Hey, Ingrid. - Hey, can you tell me why you would leave Lakeview without letting me know? I... I'm exploring my options. I never should've asked you to cut costs. You can have as much avocado toast you want. - Ugh. - That's just who you are, babe. That's not what this is about. Okay? We've been fighting a lot lately, and I just needed a change. Nora? Your angel is here. That's how great Lakeview is. They sent her out to check on their favorite customer. Lakeview's the best, Nathan. I'll upload there one day. You can't leave it... because the girl you love is gonna be at Lakeview. Yeah. Yeah, I can give it another shot. - Really? - Yeah. You don't run away from something you know is right just because there's a couple bumps on the road. INGRID: Yeah. Yes. (CHUCKLES) - Eject! - MAURICIO: Yes, miss. I brought him here. I will take him back. Um, no. He's my property. He's not your property. He's my son. Guys, I close in five minutes, so work it out, all right? (LOUDLY SLURPING) Here. Uh, as the Horizen account holder, I think you should be in possession of him. (SCOFFS) Come back real soon. We also do virtual weddings and birthdays. Thank you. (SIGHS) Be careful in the rain. I didn't get the safety case. Viv, all I ever do is take care of Nathan. I know how. Oh! No! - Hey! - Hey! Stop! Stop! Babe! Babe, I'm coming! Stop that man! He's got my boyfriend! No! Nathan! Baby! Oh... No! - (SCREAMS) - Oh, my God! Nathan?! Nathan, I'm coming for you. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh, shit! Okay. Go around. (WHIMPERING) (SCREAMS) - Ingrid's coming! - He's okay. All right? I gave her a broken drive. Nathan's on this one. Oh, thank you. (CRYING) I hate it. I hate it. Why would somebody do that? I don't know, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out. Okay? You're very committed for a customer service rep. INGRID: Ugh, it smells like dog! Fuck, fuck. Oh, Nathan. Hi. Hi, baby. Hi. I'm so sorry. (BLOWS) Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Rice. Rice! Does anybody have rice? - Oh, my God... - Eventually, - (INGRID CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) - maybe tell her he's alive. (SIGHS) (SCREAMING) Whoa! Ah! (GRUNTS) Mr. Brown! - You're back! You're back. - Yeah. I'm back. Okay, okay, okay. I can do this. Douchebag, thanks for telling me you were leaving. I had them do a wellness check on you, bust down your door, slept in your bed. I was gone for an afternoon. Hey, how was it out there? Did you bring me back anything? Oh... Actually, it's from Disney's Eternity. Yeah, the travel agent had digital souvenirs. (SCOFFS) I love it. (CHUCKLES): I freaking love it. Oh, my God. NATHAN: It is "Luke," right? - LUKE: Ah! - (LAUGHS) Hey. I didn't even say "angel." I was just thinking about you. Okay. NORA: Someone knew you were being ejected and that you'd be vulnerable. I mean, who else knew besides your mom? I don't know, but, I mean, if you found out, then couldn't anyone at Horizen? You know, you really are my angel. You saved my life. I can't believe you flew all the way to L.A. What, you thought I wouldn't even say goodbye? No, it's just... I don't know. We parted on such an awkward note yesterday. - You know, I just thought... - Wait, what? Shit. Lucy. She suspended me, and while I was out, - she must've used my avatar. - (CHUCKLES) Um... What did you say to her? Just some things I've been meaning to say for a while. Um... I mean, now that you're back... The only reason I'm back is because your girlfriend gave such a good review to my boss' boss. Yeah, she has her moments. Yeah. I'm just saying... maybe you should speak with her first. Before you say to me whatever you said to Lucy. Yeah. I'm really happy you're back. Me too. Come on. Oh... No way. I think you've earned it. Uh, yeah, yeah. Let's go. (LAUGHING) I can't believe you fell for it again. I can't believe you lied to me again. Aw. (LAUGHING) I trusted you. Unbelievable. Amazing. I'm going back to Disney Eternity. - Oh, whoa. - Mm-hmm. - Way too soon. - Yeah. See you later. (NORA LAUGHING) Oh, don't pout. Feels so good. Mm.
