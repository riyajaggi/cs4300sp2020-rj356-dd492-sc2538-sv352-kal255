If it's lraq, I never agreed to that in the first place. That wouldn't be fair. Or the other place. Palestinia. I'm not even saying there is a god. But if there is, maybe all this is happening because he or she or it is judging our culture and smiting us accordingly. Yeah, but why be such a cunt about it?. Whoa! Fuck! Oh, fuck!

We've got the keys to a van. So we'll just drive. - We'll drive away! - We can't just drive past. All right?. They won't step aside like some fucking chambermaids. We'll just, we'll... We'll distract them! We'll distract them. We'll bait them away, OK?. We'll bait them away from the gates long enough and then we'll drive straight through. (Space) With what?. A ball of string?.

Maybe you'd know what that means?. But, no. Want it now, want it fucking now. Well, come and get it. CRYlNG Get this fucking bit out here. > Look at that! Precision! Bit of precision and pride in your job. It's not a lot to ask, is it?. SOBBlNG Don't even know what that is. SOBBlNG Look at this! What is that?. > Stop fucking crying. This is an escape plan. DOOR OPENlNG Kel! Are you gonna let this fruitcake get away with this bullshit?. He's right. THUNDER RUMBLlNG Look, I'm sorry, but he is. It's worth trying. Space! Space! Oh, got a live one.
