'Grayson and Angel are in the diary room.' - (Big Brother) Hello, Grayson. - Hi, Big Brother. - Hello, Angel. How are you today?. - All right. I'm pissed off and I'm angry, and we need your permission to kill someone. Who would you like to kill?. - Who do you think?. Wonderbra. - And her spastic henchman.
