 - "Psycho" was the first time   I was aware of the editing.  - The assembly   of pieces of film...  - [screaming]  - To create fright.  - "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"  is one of the most   important movies.  - That ratchets up horror   to a whole other level.  - That's the one   that defined me.  - Sometimes you just want   to sit down and watch Jason  take out a lot   of stupid teenagers.  - There are a number   of pictures where you're able  to actually take your deepest,  most antisocial impulses   for a walk.  - "Horror" became a dirty word

 in the late '70s, early '80s.  - These films hate women.  - 55% of that audience  was women.  - They're the final girls.   That's who you identify with.  - [laughing hysterically]  [chilling string music]  ? ?  [low tones ringing]  - There's the moment   in "Halloween"  where I'm standing behind...   [laughing] This house.  I don't know anybody yet.   I'm 19 years old,  and saying to myself,   "What am I doing?  How do I do this?"  And then you hear,   "All right, everybody.  "Here we go, we're rolling!  Cameras rolling!"  And I have to start screaming.  And I had never screamed   in my life.  Who screams?  Who screams?  [screams]  - [shrieks]  - [screams]  [continual screaming]  - [screams]   - [screams]  - [screams]   - [shouts]  - No!   - [screaming]  - I suppose,   for a lot of people  who grew up on   "Friday the 13th,"  "Halloween," "Scream,"   horror equals gore.  - [screams]  [blood squelches]  - You have the idea  that all horror films  are slasher films,   which is wrong,  and then you have the idea  that, uh, slasher films   are purely misogynistic  and that the only people   who watch them are men,  and that's also wrong.  narrator: The most   extreme form  of horror films--slashers--   have been vilified  since they first   came on the scene.  - [cackles]   narrator: But they have also  been tremendously popular.  The worst of them   can still be entertaining.  The best of them tell us   brutal truths about ourselves, our fears,   and our secret desires.  ? ?  - [shouts]  - [screams]  [hollering]  - 1974, Bob Clark comes in  with "Black Christmas."  - [spluttering]   [choir singing eerily]  - [choking]  - That is the first  POV of slasher: girls in the sorority house  over the holiday... - [groans]   - [screams]  - But that becomes   sort of the--the precursor  to John Carpenter,   who comes in with "Halloween."  [menacing music]  ? ?  - "Halloween," technically,   is a slasher movie.  but it happens to be   the Cadillac  of slasher movies.  ["Halloween" theme plays]  [suspenseful synth music]  - "Halloween" also made  horror films mainstream.  It was one of the ones that  people who "don't like  horror movies" still watch.  - [heavy breathing] - "Halloween"   is remarkably effective,  like, from the opening   long take of a child  looking through a mask.  - A young boy   murders his sister  and is put away   in a mental institution.  And 16 years later...  he escapes   and comes back to the town  and to the scene of the crime. - And over the course   of Halloween day,  Michael Myers slowly   lets his presence known  to Laurie Strode.  [knocking on door]   - Tommy, hurry up!  Tommy, please! [shouts]  - This is rare in a lot   of horror films--  actually, like,   a likeable lead.  You know,   in "Friday the 13th,"  you want both   of those actors to die.  [laughing]   You don't want  Jamie Lee Curtis to die.  You want Jamie Lee Curtis   to survive.  - I think it all had   to do with emotion.  John said very clearly   what he wanted.  He said, "I really want   her vulnerability."  It's why he cast me,   apparently,  and I didn't really  understand that at 19. [menacing music]  And I learned what John meant  when I went   and saw the movie  in Hollywood at a theater.  There's the sequence   where Laurie Strode leaves  the babysitting house...  and there's this long walk  between the two houses. And of course,   the entire audience  started screaming,  "Don't go in there!"  ? ?  And that's when I understood   what John was going for  was that you cared enough   about her  that you would tell her,   "Don't do this."  [sinister music]  - So much of horror   is about mood, atmosphere,  and cinematic style.  John Carpenter   using the wide screen  and the Panaglide camera   starting with "Halloween,"  it's something   that makes the film  that much more effective.  [sharp tone plays]  - When I met John,   I was immediately impressed  that he wanted   to use the camera  to tell the story, rather than   just a recording device.  The Steadicam--   the Panaglide at the time--  was one of those tools   that John and I looked at  as being a key technique--  moving the camera fluidly.  ? ?  - You didn't know   where Michael Myers was.  You know,   you saw him outside,  and then you'd be in   making out, you know,  on a couch, and it's like,  "Okay, he's out there   someplace."  - Like, you'll watch a lot   of these movies  and you're not scared anymore. And when you think, of like,   Michael Myers, like,  I was freaked out for years.  Just the idea of some, just,   dude popping out of places...  and murdering   you real quick.  - [screams]  Oh!   [groans]  - Michael Myers   is the human being  that's actually a wolf   wearing a human face.  You know, the human   that just ain't human.  [sinister music]  - [gasps]  [whimpering]  [jarring screeching tones]  - What you saw in the sequels   was an attempt  to kind of shoehorn in, uh,  other characters   or other mythologies  just to make it   more interesting.  - In "Halloween II,"   they make it that Laurie  and Michael Myers   are brother and sister.  - That Strode girl?  That's Michael Myers' sister.  - He's not her brother.  She's not his sister.  That's just bull [bleep].  Nobody was coming   from that point of view  when they were making   the first one.  And what makes   the first one so good  is the fact that   you don't know what it is  that makes   Michael Myers go, "Her."  [menacing music]  - "Halloween" was one   of the first films  to really initiate   the final girl as a trope.  A main character   who's a woman  who is first a victim  and ultimately, a survivor   who fights back.  - [cries out]  - It's a formula   that really worked,  and it's become so common  that I think most people   don't even think about it.  - Go upstairs, get Lindsey,  and lock the bedroom door.  - I'm scared!   - Do as I say!  - The boogeyman...   - It's pure.  There's something very pure   and clean about it.  No! [struggling]  Innocence and danger   coming together  with that music  and that camera work  and the performances  is why I think we're still   talking about it today.  narrator: John Carpenter's   "Halloween"  launched the slasher boom   of the '80s.  Its influence   is still felt today.  But it didn't come out   of nowhere.  - [screaming]  - Good evening.  [eerie ambient music]  I have some news   that will delight you.  ? ?  Murder is not dead.  - Starting with, uh,   Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho"  in 1960,  we started seeing   a new approach to horror.  It was the, uh...the horror   that didn't come out of, uh,  some grotesque   radioactive anomaly,  but it could be   lurking next door.  A nice young man   like Norman Bates  could be the new Frankenstein,   the new Dracula.  - Do you go out with friends?  - [swallows] Well, a--a boy's best friend  is his mother. - Hitch always thought   it was a comedy.  He always claimed that.  - The content, as such,  was, I felt, rather amusing.  - My mother, um--  what is the phrase...  [tense music]  She isn't quite herself today.  - But it's very perverted  and very sick.  - There's hangers in the closet and stationery with   "Bates Motel" printed on it,  in case you want to make   your friends back home  feel envious.   [chuckles]  And the, uh...  Over there.  - The bathroom.   - Yeah.  - One of the big things  that I think to this day was  still shocking about "Psycho" was you killed the protagonist  40 minutes in to the movie.   - Yeah.  - Even knowing that  the shower scene was coming, I was like,  "Wait, she can't be the one who gets killed."   - "There's so much movie left." ["The Murder" playing]  - [screams]  No! [shouts]  - "Psycho" raised terror   to a level  that I had never seen, anyway, because it was near realistic.  - No!  - Before "Psycho,"  that was not imaginable,  that level of terror.  ? ?  "Psycho" and Hitchcock  brought terror   into your shower.  - "Psycho" was the first time  I was aware of the editing... [eerie, quickening pulsing]  And how your mind   gets tricked,  and what you see off-camera.  - This process of frightening  is done by means  of a given medium:  the medium of pure cinema.  ? ?  The assembly of pieces of film to create fright.  [distorted screaming]  - That shower scene is one   of the most iconic pieces  of cinema   ever to be created,  so much so that it's--   it's burned in people's brains  who haven't even seen   the movie.  [screeching string notes]   - [gasps]  - People know that   Bernard Herrmann's score--  the... [imitates string notes]   You know,  kids grow up, like, doing   that with that sound,  not knowing what it's from.  [laughing] Like, talk about   having made a cultural impact.  [ominous string music]  - Bernard Herrmann's score   to the film was very dramatic,  very--very propulsive.  It's virtually impossible  for a horror composer  not to have to wrestle   with the "Psycho" score.  ? ?  You cannot avoid it.   You have to deal with it.  ? ?  - In 1960, I'm sure people   regarded the shower scene  in "Psycho"   as having gone too far.  [rustling]  Like, "Alfred Hitchcock's   gone too far this time."  But it's indelible, it's-- they're indelible images,  and they're, like, forever, like, sort of  in your brain and, like, people have bad dreams  thinking about those movies. - John Carpenter, you know,   was greatly influenced  by "Psycho," even   to the point of casting  Janet Lee's daughter,   Jamie Lee Curtis,  in the lead role.  - Ironic that it's   the same genre...  same family.  Obviously, it was   the biggest...  thing in her life,  as I know that   "Halloween" is mine.  So when I jokingly say to you,  "'Halloween' Actress Dies"...  that's what it will say.  Nothing else.  Just like my mom.   "'Psycho' Actress Dies."  [eerie music]  - Because of Hitchcock,  people will accept cinema   first in a thriller...  in a way they won't accept it   in a love story,  in a way they won't accept it   in a period drama,  in a way they won't accept it   in almost--  most every other genre,  because Hitchcock   taught people  to be thinking of cinema first. We're just naturally okay  with the camera taking off   and doing things.  [eerie string music]  - I think it's fair to say   that "Psycho"  was a turning point...  [screeching string notes]  Certainly in American   filmmaking--  and in Hollywood filmmaking,  because there was no one   more establishment  than Alfred Hitchcock.  [dark string music]  And there was no turning back. There was no turning back.  narrator: "Psycho" influenced   every horror film to come,  and it paved the way   for a new kind  of movie monster...   - [screaming]  narrator:   The chainsaw-wielding  serial killer.   [chainsaw whirring]  [chainsaw revving]  [chainsaws whirring]  [woman screaming]  - If you think about   the landmarks  "Psycho" and "Halloween,"  clearly the bridge  between the two is Tobe Hooper's  "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." - Yeah.   - [hollering]  - [screaming]  - Out of every movie  that we've talked about,  that's the one  that defined me.  Like, that's everything   I wanted in a movie  and everything I ever wanted   to do in movies.  It was just disgusting   and nasty,  and that redneck thing...  - Relentless.   - That movie just changed  the way I thought about movies.  - Yeah.   - Instantly.  [chainsaw revving]  [girls screaming]  - We decided to re-watch   "Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"  like, a month ago.   I watched it eight times.  - [shrieking]  - "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"   is one of the most  important movies, to me,   of all horror films.  - You walk into a movie called   "Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"  and you expect the worst.  And you get it.  [woman screaming]  [menacing music]  [slurping, woman screaming]  ? ?  It was incredibly potent   and visceral...  - [sucking]  - There was an imagination--   a dark imagination--  that had no limits.  [male narrator   reading somberly]  - [laughs]   It just starts with that great, like, dreadful,   somber narration  at the beginning of the story. [narrator reading somberly]  - So right off the bat,   you're thinking, "Wow,  is this based on a true story?" And then they flash   this date...  - It really feels like   you were dropped  into, uh, watching something   happen for real.  - This heat is just  driving me crazy, I don't know if   I can take much more.  - Listen, the condition...   - "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"  was the first one   where I thought  they were real people.   - Yeah.  - I never looked   at them as actors.  - [laughing] - You don't see   any on-screen violence.  It's all implied.   - The hook...puts her  hanging on the meat hook.   - When he picks her up,  and he's holding her   over the hook...  - [shrieks]   [musical sting]  - And you came out   of that movie  certain that you remembered,  "Oh, yeah, remember, you see   the hook go through her."  But your mind just   put it all together.  - Stop.   [chainsaw revving]  [screaming] - "Texas Chainsaw"   is inspired  by the Ed Gein story   from, uh, Wisconsin.  [dark music]  female reporter:   It was a crime that shocked  the small town of   Plainfield, Wisconsin.  [projector clicks and whirs]  Edward Gein,   accused of killing a woman,  then gutting her body   like a slaughtered deer.  - Tobe told me that he--   when he was a kid,  they would tell him the story   of this guy, Ed Gein.  reporter: He would use   those body parts and bones  to make lamp shades   and other furniture.  He would also wear   dead female body parts.  ? ?  - And so they used   to use Ed Gein  as a cautionary tale.  "Don't be bad,   or Ed Gein will come for you."  ? ?  - Someone once said   before Tobe Hooper,  there had been plenty   of films about psychopaths,  but when you saw   "Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"  it was the first time   you saw a film that seemed  like it had been directed   by a psychopath.  - Tobe, he had   a sweetness to him.  At the same time, he would   try to rip your head off  if you--if you even messed   with a frame of his movie.  - If you'll pardon my French,   they didn't give a [bleep]  about what people thought  about the movie   they were making.  [sinister music]  The conditions   of making that movie  were so primitive.  I mean, these guys,  they borrowed 16-millimeter   Aeroflex cameras  from the University of Texas  under the hottest,   worst conditions.  It was like 120 degrees,  and they were like,   "Let's go out there  and stir it up."  - It was not a pleasant   experience for anyone,  and it's reflected in the film. - [screaming]  - I don't think   Tobe Hooper set out  to make a movie about Vietnam,   but he could not help  but reflect the rebellion   that was going on.  male reporter:   Subsequent investigation...  - The times were political,  and the times were,   you--you know,  steeped in Vietnam.  - Hit her, Grandpa!   - [screaming]  [wailing]  - "The Texas   Chainsaw Massacre"  is a very American story,  and--and in some ways, uh,   a capitalistic story.  - The place where they shoot   the cattle in the head  with that big air gun thing.  - Oh, that--that gun's no good. - I was in there once   with my uncle...  - What   "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"  is really about  is a family   of dispossessed workers.  - With a sledge.   [laughing]  See, that was better.  They died better that way.  - Because of automation   and loss of jobs,  they no longer have   the means, you know,  to earn th--a living   for themselves.  - [stuttering] With the new   way, people put out of jobs.  - The oppressed working class  turn the tools   of their trade  back upon   their former employers--  the chainsaw,   the hammer, and so on--  but it's also tied in   with psychic repression,  because, like, people love   the meat on their plate  but don't want to think   about how it gets made.  And by substituting   the teenagers for the cattle  and the former   dispossessed workers  enacting revenge against them,  it's a kind of un-repression   both of meat itself  and of working-class labor.  [chainsaw revving]  - [hollering]  - And Tobe called that movie  "a $60,000 flare"   he shot up from Austin.  And I mean, it's in   the Museum of Modern Art now.  It's a classic,   but it's unmatched after that. I mean, that ratchets up horror  to a whole other level.  [chainsaw whirring]  narrator: "Texas Chainsaw,"   "Halloween," and "Psycho"  opened the gates   for a new kind of horror.  ["Friday the 13th"   theme plays]  But the slasher film   as we know it was truly born  with the most successful   horror franchise  of all time...  [sharp string music]  "Friday the 13th."  narrator: When you think   of "Friday the 13th,"  you think of dead teenagers... - [screaming]   - [shrieking]  narrator: And the unstoppable   Jason Voorhees.  [sinister musical sting]  - Growing up when I did,   we all watched  "Friday the 13th"...   one, two, three, four,  five, six, seven.  Eight was horrible.  [whirring]  - [screaming]  - But in terms  of character names...  [darkly]  Jason Voorhees.  It--it was just evil.  ? ?  - I believe   that I have murdered  more people on film   than any actor in history.  I played Jason in four   of the "Friday the 13th" films. There's a lot more to playing   a character like Jason  than throwing the mask on   and, you know,  walking around threateningly,  because two of the major tools  an actor uses  are their facial expressions  and their voice.  So now, you take away   both of those  by making him silent  and putting a mask on him.  - [whimpering]  ? ?  - [screams]  - So I always was conscious  of Jason never looking awkward  or off-balance or weak.  I would never look down   to see where I was walking,  because I thought   it weakened the character.  My favorite Jason kill--   which was my favorite  all-time kill for a long time-- was the sleeping bag   from "Part VII."  - [screaming]   [quickening string music]  ? ?  - I put my heart and soul   into that character  and loved playing it.  - Name the killer   in "Friday the 13th."  - [breathing heavily]   Jason! Jason! Jason!  - I'm sorry.   That's the wrong answer.  [eerie music]  narrator: Jason is synonymous   with "Friday the 13th,"  but he's barely seen   in the original film.  The rest of the formula,   though, was in place.  - "Friday the 13th"   is a story  about a group   of camp counselors  who've come up   to set up a camp...  - Well, come on.  Let's go.  - I thought we had two weeks. - And have been   sort of targeted  by a mysterious killer.  - No...  [sinister string music]  [breathlessly] No...  [gasping]  ? ?  - One or two or three   of them get picked off,  and you say, "Oh, my goodness,  anybody could go at any time." - [gasps loudly]   - Something's wrong with Ned.  - That was, I think,   part of the--the secret  to the suspense   that we were able to create.  ["Friday the 13th"   theme plays]  [indistinct words echoing]   - It must be my imagination.  [chuckles]  [gasps, screams]  [jagged violin music]  ? ?  - We needed somebody that knew  a lot more than we did  about how to pull off   a special effect.  You wanna stab   somebody with a knife.  How do you do it?   You can't just get  a rubber knife and--   and start... [laughs]  You know, going at people.  And we were fortunate enough  to run into a guy   named Tom Savini,  and he just couldn't wait  to get involved,   and he had such wonderful,  positive energy.  - Kevin Bacon was, uh, sitting   upright underneath the bed.  His--only his head   came through the bed.  - [chokes]  - So I'm actually pushing   the arrow through  the fake chest and neck,  and my assistant, uh,   was pumping the blood.  Now, while he was pumping   the blood, the tubing came off  the blood pump,   and during the take,  he grabbed it   and blew through it,  which caused the nice gurgling  of the blood.  [terrifying violin music]  So it was a happy accident   that made the effect,  you know, a l--so much better.  - What makes   "Friday the 13th" a classic  is the reveal of Mrs. Voorhees. [sinister music]   - Steve!  [panting] Oh, Steve!  [musical sting]  Who are you?  - Well, I--I'm Mrs. Voorhees,  an old friend of the Christys'. - Everyone's trying   to survive, uh,  as they're being knocked off   one by one  by a killer that they   don't know, and then you reveal it's the mother   of this drowned boy.  - You see,   Jason was my son.  - A mother was driven mad  by her child drowning  and seeing the world ignore it  and go by  and think that they  can just restart  and go on with their lives.  The manifestation   of grief is actually  very poetic and relatable.  - [screams]  - We started to hear   some of the score  that Harry was writing for   the first "Friday the 13th,"  and this--this...   [imitates echoing sound]  Kept coming up.  ["Friday the 13th"   theme plays]  [indistinct words echoing]  - You remember a scene   at the very end, uh...  where Mrs. Voorhees--uh,   Betsy Palmer, rest her soul.  Dear Betsy.   We hear, uh, her son go...  - "Kill her, Mommy.  Kill her."  - And that's what   kicked it off for me.  I went, "She hears   voices in her head."  I went up to   a microphone and went,  "K...ma..."  And then it came out...  [imitating echoing]   Kih...mah...  And it literally became   the signature  of that series,   the sound that--  what they call   "the Jason sound."  - [whimpering]   - Look what you did to him!  - [whimpers]  - [screaming]   - [yelps]  [grunts] - I remember thinking   the movie was over.  You remember,   she was on the lake.  And I thought the m--   I legitimately was like,  "Aw, the movie's over.  [exhales]   She's at the boat."  - [growling]   [shrill violin music]  - [screaming] - He jumped out that water.   I lost it.  I don't even know   how I fell for that.  To this day...  was the loudest   I ever screamed in my life.  - The boy, Jason.  - Jason?  - Nobody knew that was  going to become a franchise,  but it was certainly easy   to replicate.  [screeching string music]  [dark music]  - The--my biggest regret is   putting the bag over his head.  - [screaming]  - So then, doing "Part III,"  this guy we had hired   as a--as a 3-D expert  was also a hockey player.  And I was trying   to figure out--  you know, I wasn't gonna   do the bag again.  "What are we gonna do?"  And one day,   he walked into my office  with a goalie mask   and said, "How about this?"  [sinister music]  - [screaming]  - It was perfect.  It was, immediately--  that was gonna be great.  - [growling]   - [screaming]  ? ?  - I don't understand   how, in the first one,  he's like an 11-year-old   who jumps out of the lake,  and then he's built like a--  a WCW wrestler.  - [screaming, whimpering] - I don't understand   what happened  where he suddenly got   all jacked.  - [screaming]  [metal crinkling]  - You know,   after the first movies  and the subsequent sequels   became,  "Who are these,   you know, awful kids  "that we sort of hate   and we can't wait  for Jason to take them out?"  [dramatic riffing music]  - [screaming]  ? ?  - [screaming]  - I've always thought that   the slasher films of the 1980s  didn't really work   as horror fiction.  But they worked pretty well   as slapstick comedies...  [jarring music]   - [strangled cry]  - And the reason   for that is, you know,  the characters are never   allowed to be anything  except one-dimensional types.  You've got a gang   of teenagers.  You've got the jock.   You've got the stoner.  You've got the slut.   You've got the virgin.  You never care about them,  you never fall   in love with them,  and so when   the serial killer starts  knocking them off   one by one...  You laugh instead of   recoil in horror,  because he's actually more   of a personality than they are. [sinister music]  - [gasps]   - With the success  of "Friday the 13th"   and the success  of "Halloween,"   people just were--  producers were ravenous   to find material  and knowing that, "Oh,   well this is the formula."  [both gasp]   [haunting organ chord]  - One of the by-products of--   of the success  of "Friday the 13th"   and a few other movies  was that people on the outside   are looking in, saying,  "Oh, they killed ten people  "and they made   a lot of money.  "We'll kill 20 people,  and we'll make   a lot more than that."  [shattering]  narrator: By the early '80s,  slasher movies   glutted the market.  Audiences loved them,  but they also inspired   outright hatred.  - [shrieking]  narrator: Where some saw   harmless entertainment,  others saw a threat   to society.  [both screaming]  - Come on, baby.  Light my fire.  [rock 'n' roll playing]   - You bet I will.  - [laughing]  - I gotta tell you something,  the worst horror movie I ever   saw was [bleep] great, okay?  - Yeah, that's true.   - That's the way that I am,  because I go in there  and I say, "What am I gonna see?  I don't know." A movie that's PG-13 that's a horror movie, it's gotta be scary in some way that's really artistic. [faint echoing scream]  - [gasps]  [eerie music]  Once you get to R   and once you get to Unrated,  you're saying, "I don't know   what I'm gonna see."  I got one word for you:  "Maniac." [quiet, sinister music]  ? ?  - "Maniac" is one   of my favorite movies,  and I had a feeling   you'd like it, which is why...  - "Maniac"--oh, of course.   - As a gift for you,  I brought you  a "Maniaction" figure.  - Holy [bleep]! We did not  rehearse this, folks. Look!   - [laughing]  A "Maniaction" figure.  - I'm so excited,  I almost dropped it! It's a "Maniac" bloody scalp. - It's--isn't that sweet?   - Yeah, it really is.  I mean, I don't know  how to thank you for that. [woman screaming]  - [whimpering]  - "Maniac" is about a guy   named Frank Zito  who's a very...   ah, oddball character  who stalks young women.  And he scalps them   and he takes their scalps home and he puts them   on these mannequins.  And it is here   he sort of struggles  with this relationship   he had with his mother.  - I will never...  [dark music]  let them take you away from me. - It's a very minimalist look   at what happens  inside the mind   of a serial killer.  - You bitch!   - What...  - [grunts]  - What're you...doing...   - [grunts]  - [gagging]  Stop it!  What are you doing?  - I mean, the original   "Maniac" is mean,  but it's actually   really powerful and,  thanks to Joe Spinell's   performance,  kind of emotional.  - [sobbing quietly]   Why'd you make me do that?  [sniffles]   I didn't wanna do it.  - It really, like,   went too far.  You know, watching that movie,   you really felt like  the killing scenes   were really protracted  and really brutal   and really grim.  [quickening violin music]  - When that movie came out,   it was so controversial  You know, a lot of women   were protesting it  because this idea that it   was misogynistic, of course.  You know, it's like   all these movies get this label of being misogynistic   because the victims  are primarily women.  - ...again.   - [moans]  - I don't feel like the film's  misogynistic at all.  As a matter of fact,   I feel, as a woman,  it really represents   a realism to me.  It's--it's--it's like  a cathartic experience  in a way,  because women live in  that sort of world every day,  where we have to be hyperaware  of who's around us   and what could happen.  [eerie music]  narrator: "Maniac" ends   with a group of women  taking brutal revenge   on the killer.  - [moaning in fear]   - And this...  narrator: Today, many horror   fans and film scholars  consider it a classic,   but in the '80s,  "Maniac" helped set off   a moral panic.  [women shrieking]   - [grunts loudly]  - Horror became a--   a dirty word, I think,  in the late '70s, early '80s,  and I think that the reason   for that was the--  the explosion   of slasher movies.  [themes overlapping   and building]  ? ?  - A new breed   of "shriek merchants"  has exploited   the once honorable genre  of the terror film.  - It was a very cheap form   of horror entertainment,  and those slasher films   got a lot of bad press  for brutalizing women,  for violence, for the gore,  and--and the people making   legitimate horror films  were afraid that they were   gonna be tainted, uh,  by the legacy of a lot   of these slasher knock-offs.  - I think a lot of people   have the wrong idea.  They identify these films   with earlier thrillers  like "Psycho,"   or even a more recent film  like "Halloween,"   which we both like.  These films aren't   in the same category.  These films hate women.  - [shrieking]  [flesh squelches,   shrieking stops]  - But don't you find that  in a really effective   horror movie,  blood stains the critics' eyes? Like, once you get  blood in your eyes... - Yes, yes.   - You can't wash it out.  They can't see anything else...  - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  - Other than the kill,   and they also feel like  if they like the movie,  that they're endorsing   that for real--  or that kind of violence.   - Yeah.  - So--so most often,  those reviews just become a soapbox to be like,  "Look, I'm a good person. "I'm a good person.   I don't like  this sort of thing,"   but the truth is, we love it.  It's like it's--  it's the enjoying fantasy, enjoying a scary story.  It's like, it's-- it's no different  from "Grimms' Fairy Tales." [suspenseful organ music]  - The slasher films celebrate   the female character  because they're   the final girls.  The people who--who survive   the slasher movies  are the final girls,  and that's who   you identify with,  and that's the smart one.  The women are the ones   who are smart.  It's the sex-crazed guys   bringing their girlfriends  to have sex that,   you know, get slaughtered.  - [gasps]  - Most of the feminists   who were against horror  were not really   watching these films  or analyzing them, you know?  They were just sort of, like,   "Pornography is bad.  Horror films are bad."   You know?  So they weren't actually   engaging with the genre.  - These women in danger films   all really boil down  to just one same image,  one disturbing image:  a woman screaming   in abject terror.  - Usually it's the people   who don't actually  know anything about the topic  that are the loudest   complainers about it.  - And unfortunately,   the audiences that go to them  don't seem to like women   too much, either.  - In the '80s,   "The New York Times" conducted, um, a poll with theatergoers  to find out who was seeing   these slasher films,  and they found out   that 45% of the audience  was made up of adolescents.  55% of that audience was women. [women screaming, wailing]   - [gagged screaming]  narrator: "Maniac,"   its slasher cousins,  and the Reagan   assassination attempt...  [gunshots]  Triggered a crackdown  on realistic violence   and gore.  - [screaming]   - By 1984,  the golden age   of slasher films was over,  but audiences   still wanted their scares.  - [shrieks]   - So film makers created  a new kind of monster.  [sinister music]  - Okay, show her.   - [gasps]  Well, is it a Good Guy or not?  - It is.   It is!  Wow.   - A Good Guy!  - One of the first   experiences of horror  was, uh, "Child's Play."  - Hi, I'm Chucky,  and I'm your friend  to the end.  Hi-de-ho!  [laughs]  - [giggling]   - When I first saw that,  I was about four--  four or five.  So it was just this little  doll and it was cute  and then all of the sudden,  it just came alive.  And it's--it's always  those moments  where the camera is moving...  [suspenseful music]   - [panting softly]  - [gasps]  - But you don't--it's kind of   the POV of the doll  that just, like...   it--it just drove me crazy.  - [shouting]  [screams]  - And I can be honest.   To this day,  I'm still affected by that.  - Nobody believes you  about Chucky. [inhales deeply] Unless you  start telling the truth... right now... they're going to  take you away from me. - It's about a mother trying  to hold her family together,  defend her--her son   against this, you know--  against the charges   of being a--a murderer.  I mean, a seven-year-old boy?  Horrible.  And the boy may be mad.  He keeps insisting   that his little--  that his doll   is talking to him.  - Come on, Chucky,  say something!  Tell me!  - Hi, I'm Chucky,  and I'm your friend to the end.  Hi-dee-ho!  [laughs]  - [grunts] [sinister music]  - To me,   horror is always about  violating the sacred.  Take a child--   something that we all look at  and coo over and look after   and dote on--  and make them...  the most evil [bleep]   out there.  And a child's toy   is sacred too.  These are things   we grow up with, and you--  you--you basically cast   horror's black shadow, uh,  over all this sacred,   righteous stuff.  - [deep voice]   You stupid bitch!  - [screaming]   - You filthy slut!  I'll teach you  to [bleep] with me!  - No! No!   - In the 1980s,  advertisers had started  to target children directly.  - Brought to you exclusively   by Play Pals,  makers of Good Guys   and other fine toys.  - It's like children   had become  these little   consumerist monsters  who could, you know,   coerce their parents  into getting them more   and more stuff  that they didn't need.  - Well, what do you think?   - I want a Good Guy  to go with it.  - I know you do, Andy,   but I didn't know about it  in time this month   to save up for it.  - I remember   my mother telling me  a crazy story   about fighting someone  in a dark alley   for a Cabbage Patch Kid.  - ? I got my doll,   I got my doll! ?  - We can see this line between the "direct to children   as consumers" advertising  on the one hand   and the potential consequences  of what that brings   into the home on the other.  - [bellowing]   - [exclaims in fear]  [screams]   - [growling]  - I was asking for--   for them to create a doll  that had never been   created before  to do things on film   that had never  been done before.  This is a breath before CGI.   There was no way out.  It was all on camera,   live or die.  [sinister music]  And we built the apartment   up--the apartment set--  four feet off the ground.  We punched holes   through the set  behind the doll   so you couldn't see the wires  directly behind it.  - [hollering]  - [groans]  - [shouts]  - I mean, I used   every trick in the book  to try to maintain...  the illusion that the doll   was alive and moving.  - Hi.  It's me, Chucky. What do you think?  [ominous piano chords]   - Mommy...  - I mean, think about it:   you're being chased  by something this big   with a knife!  You know, I mean...   [stammering]  You know, how do you sell that? - [hissing]   - [screams]  - Well...did, didn't we?  - Chucky is a piece   of horror history.  Chucky's face sits  on that horror   Hall of Fame board  right next to the guy   in the hockey mask,  right next   to the Michael Myers mask,  Freddy's glove...  he's in there.  - [screaming, groaning]  narrator: "Child's Play"   was violent,  but no one would mistake it  for the grim realism   of "Maniac."  [terrifying music]  - [screams]  - [grunts]   - [screams]  narrator: Chucky was   following a trail blazed  by one of the most   famous characters  in the history of horror...  - [cackling]   - Freddy Krueger.  - You know,   "Nightmare on Elm Street"  came out in 1984,  and I remember   seeing that movie  and I was so excited  about the fact that,  "Ooh, there's a new twist   to this sub-genre,"  that now the rules of--  of any sort of world   don't apply.  narrator: In part two,   we'll see how  "A Nightmare on Elm Street"  brought slashers back   from the grave...  - Freddy is in the imagination  of the person he's haunting...  - [screams]   - And the imagination  is larger than life.  narrator: Dive into   the psychosexual darkness  of "Candyman"...  - You have to be able   to deliver the scares,  and you have to be able   to make people talk about it  long after you've gone.  narrator: Watch as "Scream"   turns the genre inside-out...  - [screaming]   - I thought I was in  a documentary   about a serial killer,  and they're playing this,   you know, for laughs.  narrator: "The Silence of   the Lambs"  makes grisly horror   respectable.  - Love your suit.  [saw buzzing]  narrator: And 21st-century   anxiety leads  to the no-holds-barred terror   of "Saw" and "Hostel."  - [muffled hollering]   - People who don't  see these films take them   way more seriously  than the people who do.  - [screaming]   - We wanted to make something  that was super scary,   and we'd inadvertently  become known as the kings   of torture porn.  - [screaming]  - [cackling]
