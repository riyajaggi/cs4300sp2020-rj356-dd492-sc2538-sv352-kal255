 - Be my victim.  - You're never gonna   catch him.  - Everybody's a suspect.   - [screams]  - I think the fun of "Scream"  is the self-awareness...  - Oh, you wanna play  psycho killer?  - And the deconstruction   of the horror genre.  - [grunts]   - [screams]  [gunshot]   - The entire audience  jumped out of their skin.  - In a movie,   we have a chance to...  almost externalize   the fears that we have.  - [screams]  - Could I saw off my leg   if I had to?

 - We invented a whole new term. - Torture porn became   the cathartic release.  - You have to work   with the dark side.  - Horror is the only genre  where it's flattering   if somebody says,  "Ah, I couldn't watch   your movie.  Had to leave."  - [screams]  - Oh, my God!  - We're not allowed to be   scared anywhere in life.  You can't be scared at work.  But for 90 minutes, you can be afraid  and not be a coward. - [screams]  [suspenseful music]  ? ?  [chain saw revs]  - After John Carpenter's   "Halloween"  made box office history   in 1978,  slasher films   ruled the screen.  - [yelps]  - But by 1984,  audience fatigue   and critical backlash  had taken hold.  Slashers looked dead   in the water.  But the genre   was only sleeping.  - I'm certainly not the first   girl to play a woman character who fights to the death   in a battle against a monster. There will always be men   and there will always be women who are, you know,   forced to be that person.  So "Nightmare on Elm Street"   is about a group of four kids, teenagers, who realize  that they've all shared   the same nightmare.  - Eee.   - Nancy...  you dreamed about  the same creep I did. - That's impossible.  - And they don't really think   anything about it  until each one of them,   one by one,  starts dying in their dreams.  - No. No. No!  No!  No!   [screams]  - My character wants   to figure out,  like, why this is happening,  who it is that's killing them.  And so the movie's about   Nancy's quest  to discover Freddy Krueger  and why he did it.  - [growls]  - He did it as an act   of vengeance against  some vigilante parents  who killed him   in a boiler room.  - Who are you?  - Freddy Krueger   was a child murderer,  and there isn't anything funny   about that.  They kind of gloss over   that later.  - [laughing]  - The creation   of Freddy Krueger,  this man who had knives   for fingers  who would come to children   in their dreams  and kill them,   was terrifying.  It was just a terrifying idea.  [eerie music]  - [gasps]  - I mean,   "Nightmare on Elm Street"  is the next quantum leap   forward,  I think, in horror.   - Yeah, definitely.  - I mean, this killer  that can kill you in your dreams.   - Yeah.  - So suddenly you have   a slasher whose arm--  - It crosses  into the supernatural.  It crosses into  the supernatural, yeah.  - It is a blend   of supernatural and slashers.  - The rules of any sort   of world don't apply.  - Right.   - I think that's what made  Freddy Krueger   such a unique character.  - [shrieks]  [screaming]  - [growling] - It just took us   to a different place.  - Yeah. Yeah.  - [screams]  - Wes Craven was a visionary,   I think,  in terms of fear,  understanding what that--   what that could be  and maximizing that  in these broad strokes,  which "Nightmare   on Elm Street" has.  - What is one   of the earliest things  I can think of as a weapon  that would have terrified   human beings?  The cave bear reaching around   the corner  with his massive mitt  with daggers on the end   of every finger.  That's primal.  [metal screeches]  Even the colors.  I read an article on   the two most difficult colors  for the iris--or the retina   to see next to each other  were those two colors.  And then finding an actor   who was brilliant  and who could bring it to life. [eerie ambient music]  - Wes used to call Freddy   the bastard stepfather  of us all.  But when I got the part,  I didn't know   what I was gonna do.  And the makeup sessions   informed  a lot of what I did.  They were dabbing at me   with a crusty brush  and basting me   like a turkey  with Vaseline so that I   picked up the light better.  And in comes Johnny Depp   and Heather Langenkamp,  arguably the two most   attractive young people  in the world at that moment,  and it got me angry and envious  of their youth and their beauty and the fact   that these two kids  had their whole careers   ahead of them.  And I went, "Wait a minute.   I can use that."  - This is just a dream!   He isn't real!  He isn't real!   - [roars]  - [screaming]   - [laughing]  - Of course, all my fights   with Freddy  were fantastic,   and we would work on them  for a long time.  Once the camera was rolling,  you know, we got into   our characters,  and I bashed him over the head   with a coffeepot.  [chuckles]  [glass shatters]   - [groans painfully]  I think the real reason   it had  such a massive audience   and still does  is, every single one   of the films  has a really strong,   well-written survivor girl.  - Come out and show yourself,   you bastard!  - So something   really interesting  about Nancy Thompson   in "A Nightmare on Elm Street"  is that it's sort of her   breaking free  from this chain of suburbia  being this ideal   because her family is broken.  - Nancy.  - I'm gonna go   and get the guy who did it.  And I want you to be there   to arrest him  when I bring him out, okay?  - Just tell me who did it.   I'll go get him, baby.  - Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.  - Her father,   while, I think, very loving,  is very inept.  He refuses to believe her.  Her mother's an alcoholic.  She breaks free from it   by destroying the home,  thereby destroying   Freddy Krueger,  who came because her parents   had killed him.  - [gasps]  [string thwacks]  - [screams]  - I guess I'd say my very first  fans were young gay men.  And they told me   that they were using Nancy  as they faced their folks   or their parents  or their families   in revealing their true selves. I take back every bit   of energy I gave you.  You're nothing.  And they expressed to me   that it was just, like--  it was their Freddy, you know,  just, like, that scary thing   that they have to face,  that they have to fight.  I would often listen   to all sorts of people  talk about what   their Freddy was.  And, I mean,   it can be anything,  I'm telling you.   It can be anything.  Kids who were bullied   would tell me  that they would use the images  of "Nightmare on Elm Street"  to help them face bullies   in their life.  - You think you was gonna   get away from me? - I know you too well now,   Freddy.  You know, Wes Craven   probably never knew  how many he people   he was gonna help  by creating this Nancy-Freddy   dynamic.  - [roaring]  - [screams]  - It seems to me   there were several  peak nightmares,  that the first one   was really terrifying,  but there was a couple others   way downstream  that were really satisfying  and did interesting things   intellectually.  - [screams]  - There's a lot of echoes   to Kafka,  you know, and that,   insects and other things.  - [screaming]  - Freddy Krueger's   pretty terrifying  in the first   "Nightmare on Elm Street."  - Watch this.  - But he became   a one-line reader.  - How's this for a wet dream?  [laughs] [groans]  - Silly, funny, like, puns  and double entendres.   [laughs]  - This is it, Jennifer.  Your big break in TV.   - [screams]  - Welcome to prime time, bitch.  - [screams]  - With a joke here,   a joke there,  a wisecrack here, there,  it makes it easier   to set them up  for another dark sequence  or another horrific thing   or just a cheap-thrill scare.  - [gasps]   - Got your nose!  Did we go too far sometimes?   Perhaps.  And did we load it up   too much?  Sometimes, perhaps, yeah.  I'll get you, my pretty,   and your little soul too.  [laughs]  - You know, I've been,   you know,  listening to  what--how crowds respond   to horror  for most of my life.  You know, talking about   sort of--  with the Freddy movies,   with the Freddy sequels...  - Mm-hmm.   - How a black theater could--  You know, the relationship  to Freddy is almost--is closer  than it is to the victims of those movies.   - Of course.  - Right? Of course.   - You identify with Freddy.  - He's funny.  You identify with him. There's--you know him.  You don't know these new mother[bleep]  coming to get killed. - Right.   - They're just sheep  for the slaughter.  - No!  - By the way,   we're identifying with Freddy, the child murderer.  - Yes, but black people  also love them some Jason... - Yes.   - And some Michael Myers.  - [screams]  No!  [screaming]  - There's something  about these-- first of all, these characters  that don't give a [bleep]... - Mm-hmm.   - That are cold-blooded...  [dramatic music]  - That I think scratches   an itch,  a frustrated itch,   a societally frustrated itch.  - [screams]  - That itch   would be scratched  by a slasher with a hook,  a monster driven by love  and the need to kill.  - Be my victim.  [eerie music]  - Candyman.  Candyman.  Candyman.  Candyman.  - "Candyman," in a nutshell,  is a dark love story.  Virginia Madsen and I   were deeply in love  in another life.  Candyman was an artist,  and unfortunately   her father was a racist.  Had him lynched,   cut off his arm,  and replaced it with a hook.  And he was trying   to reclaim his lost love  by getting her to honor,   you know,  him as a mystery man.  - [groans]   [blow lands]  [gagging]  - Oh! [bleep]!  - [screaming] - What "Candyman" tried to do  was using slavery  and some of the violence   of slavery  to explain the emergence   of this monstrous character  who, if you say his name  into a mirror five times--  Dare you.  both: Candyman.  Candyman.   Candyman.  Candyman.  - He comes if you just say   his name.  - Candyman.  - It doesn't get much scarier   than that.  - [screams]  - Most slasher films   start with  a traumatic experience   that happens  as, like, a--sort of a  precursor to where the film   is set in modern day.  The trauma itself serves   as a triggering effect  for the killer   in the present time.  What's so interesting   about that is that  a lot of it is based   in loss and grief.  - [gasping]   - [grunts]  - It had a real impact   on a lot of audiences.  Black audiences because, hey,   even though  he's the monster...  - [screams]   - Believe in me.  Be my victim.  - We will turn out to see   blacks in a horror film.  - It was based   on Clive Barker's book  "The Forbidden."  And I think what Bernard Rose,   the director and writer,  did brilliantly   was to transpose it  to Cabrini-Green,  which is now gone   but was one of the most  dangerous housing projects   in America.  - I thought "Candyman"   was really cool  because, you know,   you're so used to seeing  these traditional   haunted house movies,  and it's, like, the opposite.  The setting is so gritty.  [eerie ambient music]  - I think "Candyman"   is intended more  for a white audience.  It's looking at kind of   the fear of the urban setting,  and Cabrini-Green   and the sprawl  of poverty in Chicago  and what might   come out of that.  [camera shutter clicks]  ? ?  - Damn it.  - One of the brilliant things   about the film  is that he doesn't appear   until 45 minutes into--  into the film.  He's spoken about.   They mytholize him.  - Everybody's scared.  He--he could come right through  these walls, you know.  I-I'm scared.  Scared for my child.  They ain't never gonna  catch him.  - Who? - Candyman.  - I think some audiences   were troubled  because so many of the people   he killed were black.  So if it was   a straight revenge story,  he would have been   killing nothing  but white people, right?  But the residents   of this project  were also his victims.  - [screaming]   [flesh tearing]  - [grunting]  - If you were to explain,  "Well, it's about   this black dude who was  "murdered for having sex   with a white lady,  "and then he comes back   and hunts the white lady  and lots of other people too,"   you'd be like,  "Nah, I don't think   we're gonna make that movie."  You know what I mean?   But somehow,  through his level   of magnetism and charm,  he manages   to make Candyman someone--  I don't know if they love him,   but who they love to fear.  ? ?  - Be my victim.  ? ?  ? ?  Be my victim.  He's got a passion.   He wants what he wants.  And this   is his unrequited love.  This is the woman   that got away,  the woman that he cherished,   you know?  And it happens to be   in a horrific environment,  but, you know,   he'd do anything for her.  Even kill her   if they can die together.  Your death would be a tale  to frighten children, to make lovers cling closer  in their rapture. Come with me and be immortal. - [groans painfully]  - I think that mixture   of terror and empathy  is very powerful.  Every great work   of horror fiction  is an exercise   in extreme empathy.  It's about falling in love   with characters  and then staying with them   as they endure the worst.  - [screams]  No!   - And he's an iconic monster.  He had bees   coming out of his mouth.  He had bees all over his face.  - [screams] - We used over 100,000 bees   on that set.  It was all practicals,   which is--you know,  totally makes a difference.  I think I got maybe 26 stings  altogether,   but they were  an essential part to...  creating the terror   for the situation.  You know,   what happens to a ghost  if he's still living flesh?  Will he be inhabited   by maggots?  Well, then we chose bees   'cause...  they're just that--you know,  every kid is afraid   of a bee sting.  - You know, there's nothing   ambiguous about horror.  Horror is an engine.  It's like   a great white shark.  It has a purpose,   something it wants to do.  It wants to scare you.  And in that way,   that lack of ambiguity  is really freeing   as a filmmaker  'cause you know   what you're trying to do.  [mob chanting angrily]  - Help! Help me! - It's a beautiful thing   to play with,  and it's even more beautiful   thing when it works.  - [screams]  - Candyman is an icon,  one of the great   supernatural monsters.  But the masked serial killer   was ready to make a comeback  with a postmodern twist.  - Slashers kind of go away  for a while. Like, once we're sort of  out of weapons... [chain saw revs]  - [groans painfully] - I think the public starts  to get bored of it. - Well, there were so--   and there were so many sequels. And they were always  diminishing returns.  - Exactly, and they were never  about being scary. And then "Scream" comes along. [dramatic music]  ? ?  - [grunts] [eerie ambient music]  - My whole goal   when writing "Scream" was,  I wanted a horror movie   to sort of  live and breathe   in a time  where the other horror movies   existed.  - If you were the only suspect  in a senseless bloodbath...  would you be standing  in the horror section?  - Kevin was smart enough   to make it  not about the filmmakers   and the actors  but about the audience.  - "Scream" is the story   of Sidney Prescott.  And it's one year after  the horrific murder   of her mother.  Just when she's about to have  some semblance   of her normal life,  just when she's starting   to trust again  and she's starting   to date again  and she's got her boyfriend,  on the anniversary   of her mother's death,  murders start occurring  as it looks like perhaps   someone takes their love  of scary movies too far.  - [screaming]  - And they start using   horror movie lingo  as a way to stalk   and kill victims.  - You never told me your name. - Why do you want to know   my name?  - 'Cause I want to know   who I'm looking at.  - What did you say?  - The opening of "Scream"   is so iconic at this point.  And it's so masterfully done.  That is Wes Craven   at the height of his career.  - It happens. Take it easy.  [telephone rings]  - The thing about Wes Craven   is that the scary stuff  comes instinctive to him.  And I think he has   a really great eye  and a sensibility to stage it   and to craft it.  The tracking shots   behind Drew Barrymore  as she just sort of walks   through this very--  this shadowed house and she   moves in and out of light,  it beautifully sets the pace.  You know,   when to dutch the angle,  when to--you know,   when to pull back,  when to go wide,   when to go close.  - The interesting thing   about that is,  you have--   at that time, certainly--  your most famous cast member  dying right away.  So it really sort of tells   an audience,  "You have no idea   what to expect."  When I auditioned for it,  there were two   very different scenes.  There was one of this loving,   caring boyfriend,  and then there was one   of this psychopath.  [eerie ambient music]  We all go a little mad   sometimes.  - No, Billy!   - Oh, [bleep].  [gunshot]   - [screams]  - Wes really wanted   to see  somebody who could--   who could convincingly play  both sides of that.  - [crying] - Billy's the killer.  And you got to believe fully   that he's the killer  so much so that you go,   "Oh, there's no way  he's the killer."  - I wanted to sort of take   the genre, rip it apart,  open it up.  - There's a formula to it,  a very simple formula.  Everybody's a suspect.  - When you talk about   the tone of "Scream,"  I think what   he's so successful at  is balancing that horror comedy  that we don't see so often  pulled off very well.  - Damn little [...].  - What'd you call me? Huh?   - Not you, Fred.  - I was quite against it   at the time.  I thought, "Wow, I thought   I was in a documentary  "about a serial killer  "and they're playing this,  you know, for laughs."  [metal groans]  - Wes found the right balance   and the tone  through the editorial process, but I do remember   we were like,  "Should he be falling down   that much?"  He's kind of, like,   the clumsiest killer alive.  And we were always   worried about  that skirt he was wearing,   you know,  how silly that would look.  But it all seemed to work out.  - Yeah, at the beginning,   they wanted me to come meet  for Skeet's role, Billy.  - I didn't do anything.  - Do you wish to give up  your right  to speak to an attorney  and have him present...  But the role of Dewey,   I thought it was so funny.  He was written as, like,  this big, buff, like,   meathead.  And I was like,   "I think I could bring  a different meathead   quality to it."  - People treat me like I'm the antichrist  of television journalism. - I don't think  you're that bad.  - No? - My favorite part   about working  on the "Scream" movies  was working with Wes Craven.  You meet few people   in this world that are--  turn out to be your heroes,   like, living heroes.  And he held himself   like a professor.  He was a really   intelligent guy.  But he'd say things like,   "Well, that was horrible.  You wanna try it again?"  - You really have to respect   your audience.  You have to know these kids   are damn smart, you know?  The wonderful thing   about the "Scream" series  was that Kevin Williamson  said, "Yeah, I've seen   all the movies too,  "and let's talk about them,   but this is not  like that," you know?  - Help me, please.   I'm at Stu Macher's house  on Turner Lane.   It's 261 Turner Lane.  Please, he's gonna try   and kill me.  - [yells] - These movies get a bad rap  for sort of being antifeminist   and misogynistic  because they are, you know?  And--and--and--   or they have been.  You know, what's great   about genre today is,  we can change all of that.  We don't have to sort of   adhere to,  you know, the rules.  In the '70s and '80s,  if a girl had sex, she--  the rule was,   she had to die.  - There are certain rules  that one must abide by  in order to successfully   survive a horror movie.  For instance, number one,   you can never have sex.  [all booing]  - We allowed her to have sex.  So you're almost ensuring   she's gonna die.  But not in this movie.  - [screams painfully] - Right up to   the very, very end  where she's like,   this is the moment  where the killer...  - Comes back to life  for one last scare.  - And she just ain't   gonna have it.  - [gasps]   [gunshot]  - It was just another way  to dismiss those old notions   of the final girl  and so that we can move   our heroine  into sort of a new place.  - Not in my movie.  - Horror gets a visceral   reaction out of people.  And it's always...  looked down upon by critics   to this day.  It astounds me.  Horror starts from kind of   a minus 25 position  and has to claw its way   upwards.  It's fun to turn that   on its head.  I think where   that anarchistic sense  of wanting people   to burn the theater down  comes from wanting   to show people,  like,   what horror can really do.  - Good evening, Clarice.  - If you hate us   and you think we're bad,  then I'm really   gonna go for it.  - [screams]   - [groaning painfully]  - A census taker   once tried to test me.  I ate his liver   with some fava beans  and a nice Chianti.  [slurping]  - "Silence of the Lambs"   is a perfect film.  It kind of shirked   the in-your-face  occasionally vulgarities   of the horror genre  and painted them   with a much finer brush  that made it a story   that was about being human  as opposed to a story   that was  about the horrors   of the world.  - What is your worst memory   of childhood?  - Death of my father.  - Horror is a ghetto   as far as  the film industry is concerned, but "Silence of the Lambs"   changed everything.  It suddenly was not only   big box office  and not only horrific   but respected.  You have   Sir Anthony Hopkins...  - I'll help you catch him,   Clarice.  - You had Jonathan Demme,   a great, admired director,  dipping their toes   into really unsavory material  but done in such   a highly polished  and Hollywood style   that you could not  deny the power of it   and the intelligence of it.  - There's things we need   to do for her.  I know that y'all   brought her this far  and that her folks would   thank you if they could  for your--for your kindness  and your sensitivity. Now, please, go on now.   Let us take care of her.  Go on now.  - I think,   with "Silence of the Lambs,"  having a fantastic   female protagonist  that is brought to life   by Jodie Foster  gave it a life   that allowed people  who do not appreciate   the horror genre  to appreciate   that performance.  And that performance   was the introduction  for a lot of people who are   uncomfortable with horror  to actually step back   and enjoy it.  [mysterious music]  - Jonathan mentioned to me  that perhaps  the Clarice Starling character, the Jodie Foster character,  was in a way so central   to the nature of the film  that the music could reflect   her character  and be a point of view   through her eyes.  [suspenseful music]  ? ?  Generally, that type of film  might have focused more   on the monster,  the Lecter character,   and I think,  by switching that up   in that film,  it humanized the story in a way that, I think, broadened   the appeal of it.  ? ?  - Senator Martin.  Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  ? ?  - I mean, Anthony Hopkins,   my God,  what an iconic performance.  - [screams]  [blows thudding]  [soaring classical music]  ? ?  - Hannibal Lecter   is the most terrifying villain  ever put on-screen,  and he is in that film   for about 14 minutes.  He's barely in it at all.  - [gasping painfully] [classical piano music   playing]  - We only see slightly more   of him than we see  of the shark in "Jaws."  [suspenseful music]  And both pictures sort of   bring home the idea  that what we can't see   is scarier  than what we can.  And that's tremendously   effective.  - [panicked breathing]  - There are   these moments where  something plays different   for white people  than it does for black people. Hannibal Lecter,  he's a psychopath. He's a white psychopath, but for some reason it's, like,  "Yo, that mother[bleep] cold." - [screams] - "This mother[bleep]  eating a face? "Oh. "That's [bleep] right there. "That [bleep]  is Hannibal Lecter. "That's my [bleep]  right there. "That's--if I'm anybody  in this movie, I'm him. "I'm not the [bleep]  who got his face eaten. I'm Hannibal Lecter." - What became of your lamb,   Clarice?  - It came out in February,  and it played right through   the year.  It was one of those films   that just  gathered momentum   week by week.  And it won five Oscars.  - When "Silence of the Lambs"  was nominated   for Best Picture,  nobody wanted   to call it a horror film.  You know, all the press   stayed away from the fact  that "Silence of the Lambs"   is really a horror film.  It's a slasher film.  - Uh, get in the truck. And I want to push it  all the way up. I really appreciate this. - But a slasher film   as Best Picture?  No, can't do that.  It was an example   of what can be done  with the genre   when it's done just right.  - Hey--hey, are you  about a size 14? - Sorry?   [blow lands]  [gasps painfully]  - What is that people love   about going  to see horror movies?  - I think what   we love about it  and what the average person   loves about it,  I think, is different.  We'd see a  "Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"  "Dawn of the Dead,"  I go, "I wanna live there.  I wanna live  inside this movie."  - "I want to re-create this   in my house."  - And essentially we did   do that, right?  - Right. Yeah. - But I think,  for the average person,  it's like, you can  safely experience   something demented.  - It's also coming to grips   with our own mortality.  Maybe there's   some weird catharsis  of, like, "Okay, well,   thank God my death  "could never nearly be as bad   as what I just saw,  "so maybe it's not so bad. Maybe I'm just gonna   fall asleep..."  - I think it's all dealing   with the fear of death.  After 9/11,  fear escalated to nearly   unbearable levels.  - [gasping]  - And that fear   was reflected in movies  that dared us   not to turn away.  - I want to play a game.  - People always ask me,  "How do you make   a horror film scary?"  And I think that   the only common thread  that I've found is when  the filmmaker, the director, is truly terrified  by the subject matter. - [gasping, coughing]  - You can tell when other  people are phoning in and trying to imitate a genre. And you can tell  when someone loves it. - I met James Wan   at film school.  We both loved horror movies.  We were both obsessed   with "The Evil Dead"  and Dario Argento  and "The Shining"   and all the rest of it.  We realized we should team up  and try to make a movie   with our own money.  And so we figured out   that the cheapest thing  we could do would be   two actors in one room.  Finally, we hit upon   the idea for "Saw."  [electricity surging]   - Ahh.  - "Saw" is about two men   who wake up  chained to the wall   in this dilapidated,  dirty bathroom, basically.  They don't know   how they got there.  But lying between them   is a dead body.  And they find out   that they've been put there  by a sadistic serial killer  who forces people to play games  for their lives.  - John Kramer is   a mechanical engineer.  He's an architect.  He is somewhat   of a philosopher.  He is a master at prosthetics, a bit of a magician of sorts,  And with John, what you see   is often not what you get.  - Whoever brought us here  could have killed us by now. But they didn't. They must want something   from us.  - You got Leigh over here,  and you got Carry Elwes   over here,  and you got this guy   in the middle  and this strength   and this silence.  But I always felt   his centralness to this story.  - [muffled gasp]  - The way that I see Jigsaw  is kind of the Zen master   of sadism.  - Hello, Amanda.  You don't know me,  but I know you.  I want to play a game.  - His mission, of course,   is to  help people to see   the value of life.  And whether we think   his methods are appropriate  or not, that's a different   story altogether.  - My family!  - [screams]   [gunshot]  - There was something   about watching human behavior  in extreme circumstances   in "Saw,"  and I think--   and I thought to myself,  "Well, could I saw off my leg   if I had to?  "Would I do it?   How would I do it?  Could I do it?"  - [grunting painfully]  - [screaming]  When you don't have   a big star  in the lead role   and you don't have the money  for special effects,  the only thing you have   going for you  is that question,   "What's gonna happen next?"  What are you doing? Both James and I always loved   really great...  twist endings   that made you go back  and reexamine the movie.  We really thought   we had something good.  - I think I was there   about 12 or 13 days,  Lying in this pool of blood   on the bathroom floor.  You're quite convinced   that he's where he is,  and you forget about it   in some way.  - The biggest reaction   that I think  I've had in my career   was the ending of "Saw,"  that ending when he stands up   off the floor.  - Which is one of the reasons   why I did the film,  'cause I thought it would be   a remarkable moment.  It was worth doing   just for that moment.  - And to actually physically   see people lose their mind  and yell at the screen...  I mean, people would just be   shouting, like, "No way!  No way!"  So that was the best feeling,  you know, we could have   ever had.  [tense music]  - The last thing he says   before he closes the door  to leave, he says,   "Some people..."  Are so ungrateful   to be alive.  But not you.  Not anymore.  - [screams]  - Game over.   - [screams]  [screams]  To me, "Saw"   is that original film,  and then all the other movies,   they sit over here,  and then the original film,   to me, sits on its own.  - The later "Saws," yeah,   they became more--  more about the torture,   but really they were  torture about people   who deserved it.  The "Saw" movies,   it's the bad guys  who are being tortured.  - According to your policy,  your secretary   is older and weaker  and therefore less worthy   to survive.  - By, I think it was "Saw 6,"  where they're going   after insurance companies  that have denied people   their claims, and--  I don't know--   maybe they kind of deserve it  in the world of that movie.  - [screams]  - I've had skateboarders,   12-year-olds,  come up to me,   groups of them, and say,  "Yeah, we love those movies."  You have one minute   to pull the fishhook  from her stomach   and unlock her device.  And I say, "Yeah, really?   Why? Why do you love 'em?"  And they say, "Because...  they teach you stuff."  I said, "Like what?"  They say, "Well, like, to--   that you need  to appreciate your life."  - [screaming]   - No!  - And they're not talking   about the traps.  They're not talking   about the blood.  They're talking about concepts  that resonate in the film.  [all gasping]  So when you get   this little germ  of an idea, of a thought,  when it's surrounded   by that kind of intensity,  it makes the germ resonate   in a certain way.  [bone cracking]   - [screaming]  - One of the issues with   the "Saw" movies--  and you can take it   however you want--  is the fact that we invented   a whole new term,  "torture porn."  [gears grinding]  - [gasping]  - But we invented it   at the very same time  America, as a nation,  was under world indictment  for actually torturing people.  [dramatic music]  ? ?  - The torture porn cycle   of horror films  is strongly linked   to the height of what  George W. Bush termed   the War on Terror.  - This crusade.  - Use any means   at our disposal.  - This war on terrorism.  ? ?  - The torture porn cycle   is kind of  the cycle of the extreme   horror movie,  the "can you not look away?"  - [screaming]  - "Can you believe how far   they're taking this?  Can you handle it?"  - [screaming]  - And I think it really kind of was crystallized with "Hostel." A lot of people say   it started with "Saw."  I think the original "Saw"  plays more as   a thriller horror movie  than a torture porn movie.  [chain saw revs]  - Hostel becomes   a little bit more  of the "how much can you stand   to watch?"  - When we started making  our movies, the term "torture porn"  came out. - I'll credit--  I'll give you that one.  [laughter]  - All right,  I'll take that one. [chain saw revs]  - [screaming]  - One of the things   about torture porn  is that we are no longer afraid  of bogeymen.  Michael and Jason   and those characters  lost a certain currency.  And what really strikes fear,  particularly in   the United States  in a post-9/11 moment,   is other people.  Other people are frightening.  - You're not going? - I've seen this show.  - The "Hostel" franchise   speaks truth to power  and presents Americans   in the way  that the world perceives us.  - The whole first section   of the film...  it's kind of done like   a teen sex comedy, right?  Like, before it gets   into the horrific scenes,  we see Paxton, Josh,   and their friend Oli  in Amsterdam.  And they're just there   to party and smoke pot  and especially,   in a very extended sequence,  have sex with prostitutes.  It invokes this whole   kind of privilege  of paying to do something   to somebody else.  - But it's just like  everyone's out for themselves.  You're not meeting friends.  You're meeting someone  who could be the person  that's gonna kill  and rape and murder you.  - You're very patient.  I don't--I don't remember-- - It was 45 minutes.   - Yeah, you go 45 minutes.  - Then we kill  our first character.  - In that time, you are allowing us to identify   with the soon-to-be victims,  but you're also   subtlety allowing us  to hate them in a weird way.   - Mm-hmm.  - 'Cause they're being   kind of rude--  they're being so American.  So by the time   you get to the killing,  we're half identifying   with the killer,  half identifying with   the victim, and I think  that part of it is the   weirdest thing about horror.  Like, we need to be able   to identify  with that dark side of us  that maybe wants to kill somebody sometimes. - I am an American.  I got rights.  - Get the [bleep] out! - What I think is important   and interesting  about "Hostel" is that   it doesn't allow the viewer  to feel that sense   that the American  is exempt from implication   in the War on Terror  and in the use of torture.  - Who are you?  What the--   where the [bleep] am I?  - I guess it's kind of like  a pushback kind of? - Mm-hmm.   - Like, oh, you think  you rule the world?  You don't. - The first extended scene   of torture that we have  is of this kind of privileged, young, white American male.  And we see his body   kind of taken away  secretively to this   foreign torture center  and tortured in an act   that reminds us  of the extraordinary   rendition program.  [drill whirs]   - No!  [screams]  - And the viewer identifying   with Josh,  you know,   is forced in a position  of having to imagine themselves as being subject to torture.  [flesh tearing]   - [screaming]  - There are people that,   you know,  watch torture videos.  And you pay a certain amount,  and you can become  Mr. Director.  And the fact that that exists  internationally  in much poorer countries  where, you know,   maybe the parents have died  and the kids are easier   to get,  it's a really   disgusting quality  that exists in humanity  that we don't even want   to talk about.  And I think that's why  we just got a little peek  of a window into it  in "Hostel."  And it was too much   for most people to accept.  - The real world   is much scarier than anything  that Eli Roth or Stephen King   could come up with.  It's a really disturbing,   sick, violent world  we live in.   Horror films reflect that.  And horror films   are a way of people  coming to terms with   the violence in society,  trying to deal with it   and trying to,  you know,   escape it a lot of ways.  - We're not allowed to be   scared anywhere in life.  I hear from soldiers  on military bases that were watching "Hostel" and watching my films  and screaming. And, like,  they're dealing with death, but they're not allowed  to be afraid. But for 90 minutes, you can  be afraid and not be a coward. More than any other monster   in horror,  the slasher taps   into our primal fear  of the predator.  And when that predator   comes in human form,  you have to wonder...  [suspenseful music]  "Will I be   the resourceful survivor..."  ? ?  "Or just another kill?"  - He's gone.  - [screams]  - [yells]
