 The director and staff members. Hurry up and get ready. We're back? Hey, assistant director! -Yes? -What is Su-jeong doing? -She's here. -Be quick. Su-jeong Song is here. All right. Okay, we'll start shooting now. What is this now? Sam-yong, is Su-jeong feeling okay today? Sir! -What's the matter with you? -I missed you. You saw me ten minutes ago. What is wrong with you these days? What? Did Su-jeong hear about it yet? Did she give you a hard time for it? Hear what? Her half-sister. Her half-sister? That's right. She's your half-sister. Miss Su-jeong Song, I'm Mi-jin Lee. What? What the hell did you say? -Do you want to die? -Don't do it. Where the hell are you going? Come back here, you bastards! What are you all looking at? This place is all messed up! We came back to that day? Sam-yong. Pretend that I'm not here. When Su-jeong cools down, call me, all right? Hold on. Sir! What should I do now? We don't have time. Let's do it quickly. Ready, action. Dad. Yes? Dad, you always told me that I must marry On Dal. On Dal. What happened to him? I don't know what happened to On Dal. Cut! What nonsense is "I don't know"? -My goodness. -I don't have time for this. Su-jeong, everything was fine. Did you not like something? Everyone has been waiting for you for over three hours now. Chief, step aside. What? Chief? You look like a corrupt official at a glance. Corrupt? He looks like a cunning official at first glance. Excuse me? I am a eunuch. You look great together. What? -It's because you acted like an official. -Su-jeong! Sir, please let me play an official. I'm confident I can pull it off. Goodness, she really is unbelievable. Miss Su-jeong Song. I'm Mi-jin Lee... You can have that jerk who only has money. Hang on a second. Don't hold me. -We only hung out for a while. -You know I would understand it. -You don't deserve him... -Of course not. I deserve so much better. That's why you should have him. You don't get what I'm saying. I'm telling you to have him because I get it. By the way, he likes to get spanked. I wish you both happiness. You bitch! Su-jeong. -Let go. -Why are we struggling to pull her? I missed you. Su-jeong, you're scaring me. Let go. No! Goodness, Su-jeong! -Let go of me! -No! Su-jeong, I will take care of everything and ask the staff members to keep quiet. Go somewhere nobody knows with Sam-yong. Not your home or the agency. What then? Say it. Say what you were going to say quickly! Me? Right, I'll take care of everything. Just go somewhere far with Sam-yong, somewhere nobody knows about. Okay. Sam-yong, the warrior! I will obey your order! Let's go. What's the matter with them? Why are they getting in that car instead of the van? What do we do now? -Start the car. -Start the car. That's done. What's next? Where should we go? Your destination is set. -What? -Turn right. Turn right? Turn right, now. The navigation system did it by itself. It's doing nothing. No. Set the destination right now. I beg of you. I saw On Dal getting stabbed. He might be dead. Please, I beg of you. Su-jeong. What? Su-jeong, the book is here! The book? What? Is he dead? No, that's not it. In the 21st year of King Pyeong-won's reign, Qin invades to annihilate everyone including On Dal, and the Ko family becomes the royal family. No. On Dal. This one is for my dad, the person you killed when you were nine. This is for the people who you have killed for the past 15 years. Die! This is for the people you would've killed from now on. I am like a flower. How could I die... Moo-myung! Open your eyes. You must call the princess' name yourself. Pyeong-gang. Say the name, Pyeong-gang. Moo-myung. Pyeong-gang. DIGNITY Moo-myung. To everyone in the world except for the king and myself, you two are known to be dead. Il-yong's remnants could attack you two any minute now, so it is better to leave it that way. Until they arrive at the palace, you must stay in caskets. I will not go back. I have no reason to return to the palace since Nan-nyeon is gone. I have a request for His Majesty. Before that, please grant my wish. I would like to give my name to you. Become On Dal on my behalf and marry Princess Pyeong-gang. Moo-myung. Pyeong-gang. I love you. Therefore, Pyeong-gang and On Dal got married. On Dal went into the battlefield later and became a general by making great achievements. HISTORY It's fine now, because I came back. It all turned out well. It turned out well. On Dal. Su-jeong. On Dal. There's no boat for Great Power. I am planning to go to Korea. On Dal, everyone says there is no such country. You cannot go there. Who knows? I might get there one day if I continue to walk constantly. On Dal. Love slowly Comes to me It completes My other half With my heart fluttering I look at you in the eyes Without any words My eyes want you I love you. You insisted that you needed a foreign car no matter what, yet you're riding this piece of shit. Will you be fine to shoot this drama? Then should I not do it? I have to take care of you both. Su-jeong is one of a kind. You can still smile after hearing that? We went through all sorts of hardships, so I understand her. You would go to another world just to understand her twice. Another world? I want to go there. I miss her so much. You two are really weird these days. It's because there is pain that you don't know about. You prick. The new manager will come soon. -Is it a girl? -Come on! -I'm sorry. -Come to your senses. -All right. -Train her properly. I will. Let's go. -I'll get going. -Bye. I miss you, Gwang-nyeon. Boong Boong, what's wrong? Are you not well? Boong Boong, my goodness. Mister Sam-yong Byun? Gwang-nyeon. Excuse me? -I missed you. -What a crazy bastard! Goodness, wait. Be careful from now on. I will. Goodness, it's cold. Don't stare at me. I won't. Still, can I stay by your side? -Excuse me? -I'm the road manager, Sam-yong Byun. I would like to do my job. I'm looking forward to working with you. Are you okay? It hurts. It's cold. Why did you come so early? It's surprising, right? That's not what I meant. What I meant was that I'm grateful to you for coming this early. By the way, do you see ghosts too? Because I was feeling uncomfortable, I looked it up, then I realized that one of my ancestors was a chief in Danyang. He was just such a numbnuts. The only thing written on his tombstone was "Corrupt Official." You couldn't be any sharper. How did you know? Is he behind me right now? No, it's right here. What? I'll go rest in the van. All right. Have a good rest. The success of our drama depends on Su-jeong, Korean top star. Su-jeong, you know that Pyeong-gang refused the old days' customs where men chose women. She chose Dumb On Dal and went on with her life. She's the first Nannyeon in Korean history! Gosh... Nan-nyeon? Nan-nyeon. -Nan-nyeon. -You must be out of your mind. Nan-nyeon, the top star, I will not let you go. I got you. -What? -I got you. What an unfortunate destiny I have. I became crazy after meeting Nan-nyeon. I'm sorry I made you go crazy. On Dal, live well. Don't ever meet a wench like me. Nan-nyeon, let us get along well again. If my life ends in a failure, I will think about it then. Nan-nyeon, come to your senses. We cannot be together. I will not be related to you even if I die. Never. My heart has become all dark because of you too. Why? Take care of your own heart. What a crazy woman you are. How could you be so ignorant? You do not know that I like you, do you? I don't know about you liking me, but when it comes to me liking you, I know that now. We will probably argue tomorrow. Due to your horrible personality, I often feel the sudden surge of anger. -On Dal. -You will get angry that way. "I'm in trouble." After thinking about how to soothe your anger, I will prepare this. Forgive me. Like Sam-yong, you would have your family in your world, but I am asking you to stay here. I am really sorry. However, no matter what happens, I will make you happy in the world where you live and the world where I live. I will make you happier than any other woman. Therefore, Nan-nyeon, will you marry me? I will. No. You will die if you go. I will not say goodbye because we will meet again no matter what. On Dal. No way. The world without you is only darkness to me. On Dal? You... I came this time... to see you. On Dal. Your destination is set. Subtitle translation by Seu-na Park
