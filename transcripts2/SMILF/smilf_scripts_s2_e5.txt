It's my grandfather's name. Means wolf. Freedom, inteligencia, libertad. - It's the same exact spelling. - You know, natural instincts. - It's not the same... - Plus an O. Yeah, but it doesn't mean the same thing. There's a lot of words that change when you put a O after it. Yeah, Hitler and Hitlero. - Right. - Same thing. "Hitlero" sounds like a cereal. "Hitler" sounds like a serial killer. That's a good point. Adolfo Gonzalez. Why do we even have to use Gonzalez anyways? Why not? What else would we name the kid? You hate your dad. You hate your dad. Yeah, that's why I have my mother's name. Look, it's one thing for you not to take my name, but for my son? No way. Okay, how about we take him out of my body, put him in your stomach, you squeeze him out your dick, then we name him Adolfo Gonzalez? [MOANING] [♪ GENTLE MUSIC ♪] ♪♪♪ [FIONA] All right, so... I'm going to take a little listen to his little heart. - [BRIDGE] Okay. - [FIONA] Okay. - Mm. - You hear that? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah?

Yeah? - Thanks. Thank you. Okay. Good. - Okay. - So... - Okay. - ...anything else? Any fears, any kind of shames, anything like that going on just could sort of delay the labor process. Good thing he's not pushing the baby out. - Bridgette. - I was making a funny joke. I was making a funny. [LAUGHS] And, Rafi, all sober? - It's all good? - [RAFI] All good. [FIONA] So anything? Yeah, I mean, as long as it really just was a kiss, then I think we're good, right? It was just a kiss? 'Cause if you were lying about it, it would really... it would delay the labor process. Babe, I wouldn't lie about that. - It was just a kiss. - [BRIDGE] Okay. So it's just a kiss, we're all good. - [FIONA] Okay. - It's just a kiss. Excellent. So, Bridge... let it go. - Me? Oh, no. - [FIONA] Yeah. It seems to me that your ego is still hanging on to the Shaunie thing. Just... just let it go. Just let it go, babe. You're gonna kiss a woman and you're gonna rub my shoulder and say, "Let it go"? It's one thing for her to say it. But for you to say it is fucked up. - I guess I am still... - [FIONA] Just a little. ...hanging on to it. - [FIONA] Mm-hmm. - Okay. He's the one who gets mad when I say hi to a guy.
