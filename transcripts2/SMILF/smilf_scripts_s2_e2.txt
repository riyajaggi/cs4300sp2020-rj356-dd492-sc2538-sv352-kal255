Look, I got another client coming in, so why don't you think about it and we can get into it tonight when I take you out? What? Take you out. Um, that's nice of you, but I don't... I, uh, don't have a babysitter. Why can't Rafi watch Larry? He doesn't have shit to do. So you wanna go out with me? Um... - Sure. - Yeah. Okay. But I don't kiss. Um, I haven't been on any dates since my son was born, so I'm very out of practice. I might act very weird, and I'm not gonna do any of that porn grooming stuff that you might be used to. Well, I don't hold hands, so... It's a date. I'll get you my card. - Okay. - Yes, do that. Hot stuff. - You know what? - He's hot. - This may be my fresh start. - W-why are you doing that? I can move on from my dad and stop masturbating to Harvey. Oof. I'm just happy that you're going on a date finally. - You need it. - Can you watch Larry tonight? Uh, no. Aren't you a little old for a tramp stamp? First of all, it's not a tramp stamp. It is a thigh tat. Ain't that right? - Mm-hmm. - Thigh tat. Shit, I need to find a sitter. Is that poop? It is. I should've got that tatted. Larry, look at the poop. Oh, God. How am I gonna... You stupid-ass Range Rover. How do you like that one, mister? Fuckin' parking. Hey, Tutu. Some douchebag parked his Land Rover right in my driveway. I had to park on the sidewalk like an asshole. Oh, my, God. I'm drenched in sweat! I could be dying of heatstroke here! I'm tellin' ya, they're ruining everything. Used to be a good place here, you know? Southie was all about families. Now it's just for yuppies. Well, yuppies drive up real estate values, Tutu. Well, why do I care about that? I'm just saying, it's a good thing. You know what I mean? We got almost everything packed here anyway. You're not gonna give away his coat. That was his favorite jacket. - You gonna wear this? - No, but you could. It is not my style. It's my style. I'll wear that. - I'll take that. - Yeah, you go ahead, Jackie. - Really? - It's cute. I loved Joe. I'll think of him every time I wear it. All right, it's yours. Go on in the kitchen. Your platter's in the fridge. I'm sorry I have to take it back. We got the chief of surgery and his wife coming for dinner, and if the dishes don't match, trust me, he'll be the one that'll notice. You know, Junior, my sister, no matter what it is, if it's free, she wants it. Jack. You're gonna have to throw out those sandwiches. I think they're old. Look, I found his, uh... his little goody bag. Your father was in a lot of pain. This is all medicinal. Yeah, you know, he thought the gin and the vodka was medicinal too. Then we should all thank AA, huh? - It's not easy being a parent. - Yeah, I know. I got a couple kids Joe never saw. Could've come by. If you would've come by, you would've known - just how sick he actually was. - Okay. Everybody grieves differently. All right, yeah, I'm gonna grieve at work. I'll see you, Jackie, okay? - See ya. - Yeah, I got an overnight. See ya. Uh, bye, Tutu. All right. - All right, you be careful, Joe. - Oh, yeah. Take care, Junior. - What was that? - I don't know. He was angry. You know, we didn't like to talk about this, Joe and I, but Joe Jr., low IQ. - Is that what it is? - Yes. People with low IQs don't have a sense of humor. They think... they're not sure... but the mother drank a little bit, you know, - while she was pregnant. - I'd be angry. Jack, what are you eating? - Carrot? - All the food in there, and you choose a carrot? I couldn't eat cake. There's so much tension in here. Well, we have something for tension. - Hello. - There it is. - What's up? - Chillin'. - Where's Rafi? - Over there. Yo, Raf! - Raf! - What? The Bird landed. You look good. - I'm trying. - You are. - It's paying off. - All right. - Hi. - Hey. You guys are here early. - Hey, buddy. - Yeah, I gotta go to Ally's early. - Rivers is sick. - Hey, buddy. Yeah, that's cool. I'll leave him with Carlos. I'm in the middle of a session. So I need you to watch Larry tonight 'cause I have a date. - Tonight? - Yeah. - I can't tonight. - Why not? I planned this scavenger hunt for Nelson. Like, I hid clues all around the neighborhood, and it's gonna end with a romantic dinner. It's gonna be so awesome, right, buddy? Candles and everything. You planned a scavenger hunt? - Yeah. - Come on, just do that tomorrow. - I can't do it tomorrow. - Rafi, you're the only person I have to ask, and I have a date tonight, and it's, like, one time I'm asking you. I know, Bridgette, but you can't just do this on a whim all the time, whenever you feel like it. I have a schedule. What if this guy's my person? - What? - Let's go. Come on. What are you doing? - Bye. - You can't just take Larry. - That's not fair. - Oh, you know what's not fair? You owing me four years of child support, and I'm keeping track of every single penny. It's, like, $10 million. Ten million? Is that it? - Ten million! - Have fun on your date. Feel sorry for the guy. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Well, I feel like I just met Larry's new daddy. - Oh, you did? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. Well, how about I find Larry a new mama? Ow. - Go. - I'm trying. You act like you never smoked pot before. Come on. I smoked pot before, just not, like, from this thing. Here you go. No, thank you. Who is it? My beautiful daughter. I'm not interested. Since when do you smoke pot? Well, you know what? I was, uh, diagnosed... well, I was self-diagnosed... a few years ago. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. I read a lot of books. I watched a lot of docs. And I have, I'm pretty sure, ADHD, ADD, I could have a little bit oppositional defiant disorder. You know, sometimes I get mad. - Mm-hmm. - I have PTSD. You know why. And, uh, I also have restless leg syndrome. I do, and cannabis is very helpful for that. - You know what's not helpful? - What? That Joe Jr. being an asshole. - Thank God you said that, Jack. - Yeah. Yeah. I was feeling that whole time... - I don't like that. - Till you showed up. He was being such a bastard. Yeah, how you two handling the house? What? Handling the house together, you two, now that it's left... I'm not handling the house. I'm living in the house. That's how we're handling it. I think you could make a lot of money on the house. - You too? - I don't know why you want to stay here. You could get out of this shithole. - You could retire someplace nice. - Retire? - Yeah, retire. - Oh, come on. - Come on, Jackie. - You come on. There's no place in the world more beautiful to me than Southie. Oh, not anymore. I can think of a few other places. - Like where? - Anywhere. Anywhere. You can't think of one good thing, Jack, from living here? Come on. Just one thing, from this neighborhood we grew up in. The scanner. Dad's scanner. Grandpa, this is Squad 51. Right? Adam 12, seen a man on a... You know what? Joe had a scanner. I think I saw it when they were putting in the b... I think Joe Jr. put it in one of those boxes. - Joe put Joe's scanner in this box. - Don't kid me like that. _ _ Hey, Chloe, girl. Hey, Chloe, are you old enough to babysit? Hi, Larry. I can't. I have a date tonight. Hi. I do too. Or maybe I don't, 'cause I can't find a babysitter. Wanna see a picture? Yeah, sure. - See? - Mm. He's cute. Cuter than I normally like them. Rafi's pretty attractive. - Ew. - Sorry. And look, he does all that volunteer work. I don't do any of that stuff. I-I mean, you-you tutor us. Yeah, 'cause I get paid to be here. I mean, I guess that's true. Do you think the one-arm thing's weird? Oh, I didn't... I didn't even notice. Yeah, you can b... it's barely noticeable. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm just freaking out. I really need to find a nice guy and settle down, but I hate dating. Well, how do you ever get a boyfriend if you don't date? Because, Rivers, boys just hang around long enough and suddenly they become my boyfriend. Just take the pressure off yourself. - You're gonna be great. - Okay. Thank you. Can you ask my mom if I can have her new iTunes password? Fine, but you have to do some homework. Okay. I'll do this one. - Can you watch him? - Yeah. I'll be right back. Okay. Hey, Ally. Rivers is still a little sick, so he wanted me to ask you for your iTunes password. Hi. Knock, knock. Is that okay? Is this a bad time? I can come back. Oh, Bridge. Oh, Ally. I think I have Lyme disease. What? Today's my birthday. Happy birthday. What are you doing tonight? Are you... are you celebrating? Why? You wanna have dinner? - Oh... me? - Oh, my God. That would be amazing. Let's totally have dinner. - Oh, that would be so fun. - I can't. I can't tonight. I'm actually supposed to have a date, but no one can watch Larry. Oh. Elsie can stay with him. Yeah, Elsie will do it. Just come to dinner with me, and then go on your date. - Oh... - Elsie! - Really? - Yeah. - She won't care? - Oh, no, she won't care. She doesn't have anything else to do. - She can do it. - Okay. And then I'll go see Hank. - So much fun! - Great. Where do you wanna go? - Let's do Chinese. - I love Chinese. - Kung pao chicken. - Chicken. Bridge, you would've told me if you knew about Mr. Daddy, right? Yeah. I didn't know. - I would've told you. - I know. I'm Team Ally. Can you please take my, um... my riding stuff to the cleaners for me? Um... Not the boots. The boots get lost. Just the clothes part. Oh, yeah. You know... I'm actually just gonna give these to Elsie, but, um, can Rivers have your password? Don't give anything to Rivers. - Seriously. - Okay. - Nothing at all. - Nothing. - Happy birthday! - Thanks. Mmm. I mean, was this always so boring? We got a 99 in Mattapan. What's that one, Jack? - A hostage. - Hmm. Or a holdup. Suspect is armed and dangerous. Oh, turn it off. We know how this ends. What about mus... you wanna listen to the music?

They need a tutor, and... now with all this mess with Mr. Daddy, I can't have another woman in the house. What about Elsie and Ida? They don't count, Bridge. And anyway, this has been a long time coming. You're gonna go get something else, something great. You don't wanna be a tutor for the rest of your life.
