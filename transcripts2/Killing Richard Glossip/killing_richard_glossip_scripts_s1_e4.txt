 WE'RE STEPS AWAY FROM WHERE THEY WANT TO EXECUTE YOU. I'VE BEEN STEPS AWAY THERE THREE TIMES, SO... AND THREE TIMES, SO WHAT IS THAT LIKE? IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE BECAUSE I GUESS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT TO KNOW WHAT I DID TO GET THE FEEL OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE. I THINK WHAT SCARES ME THE MOST IS I TRUST IN THIS SYSTEM TO GET IT RIGHT, AND TO GET THAT CLOSE THREE DIFFERENT TIMES, I'M SITTING THERE GOING, "HOW CAN THEY GET THIS WRONG?"

 I MEAN, IT'S PLAIN AS DAY. HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE THE TRUTH? ** IN OKLAHOMA, DEATH ROW INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP IS LIVING ON BORROWED TIME. ALREADY, HE'S BEEN ON THE BRINK OF EXECUTION ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. NOW, ONCE AGAIN, THE STATE IS PREPARING TO PUT HIM TO DEATH, ON CHARGES OF HIRING ANOTHER MAN TO COMMIT MURDER. BUT FAR TOO MANY TROUBLING QUESTIONS SWIRL AROUND HIS CASE. I'M NOT IN THIS THING, MAN! I'M REALLY NOT. I'M JOE BERLINGER. AS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER,

 I'VE SPENT MY CAREER SHINING A LIGHT ON STORIES OF INJUSTICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? THEY'RE READY TO KILL THIS GUY. I THINK IT'S A REAL BAD DEAL. AS GLOSSIP'S LAWYERS SEARCH FOR NEW EVIDENCE... EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH HAPPENED RIGHT HERE. ...TIME IS RUNNING OUT. DID THE SYSTEM GET IT WRONG WITH RICHARD GLOSSIP? IT'S AN INNOCENT MAN WHO'S GONNA BE EXECUTED IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW. WE ARE THE LAST, BEST CHANCE THAT RICH HAS, AND WE HAVE TO SUCCEED, BECAUSE IF WE FAIL, HE DIES. WHY IS OKLAHOMA SO HELL-BENT ON KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP? ** TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR SITUATION. YOU'VE BEEN IN PRISON HOW LONG NOW? 19 YEARS. 19 YEARS. LIKE I SAID ALL ALONG, FROM DAY 1, THAT I WAS INNOCENT OF THIS, AND I'VE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT. PEOPLE IN THIS STATE, PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAVE SEEN FOR THEMSELVES EVERYTHING THAT'S OUT THERE, AND THEY ALL COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION -- HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY? RICHARD GLOSSIP WAS SENT TO DEATH ROW IN 1998. BETWEEN THAT TIME AND 2014, WHEN GLOSSIP FIRST BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR EXECUTION, THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA HAD ALREADY PUT 99 INMATES TO DEATH. THROUGHOUT THOSE 16 YEARS, GLOSSIP HAS CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE. IF TRULY INNOCENT, GLOSSIP'S ORDEAL ON DEATH ROW HAS GIVEN HIM A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON OKLAHOMA'S KILLING MACHINERY. ** ON APRIL 14th, 2014, THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS LINED UP TWO EXECUTIONS IN ONE DAY. BOTH INMATES WERE SCHEDULED TO DIE BEFORE RICHARD GLOSSIP. CLAYTON LOCKETT, CONVICTED OF MURDER, WAS SCHEDULED TO DIE AT 6 P.M. CHARLES WARNER, WHO WAS CONVICTED OF RAPING AND MURDERING AN 11-MONTH-OLD BABY, WOULD FOLLOW. WELL, IN CLAYTON LOCKETT'S CASE, I REPRESENTED HIM FOR 11 YEARS AT THE TIME HE WAS EXECUTED. THE BLINDS WERE OPENED AT APPROXIMATELY 6:23. WE CAN'T SEE ANYTHING OF MR. LOCKETT OTHER THAN THE TOP OF HIS SHOULDERS AND HIS HEAD. MR. LOCKETT SAID HE DID NOT HAVE ANY LAST WORDS, AND SHE SIGNALED THE EXECUTION TO PROCEED. AFTER THEY HIT HIM WITH THE DRUGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO STOP THE HEART, HE BEGAN TO WRITHE ON THE GURNEY FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 7, 8, 9 MINUTES. WITH EVIDENT GREAT PHYSICAL EFFORT, LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS AND HIS HEAD OFF OF THE GURNEY. I HEARD DISTINCTLY THAT HE SAID AT ONE POINT, "MAN." MIDAZOLAM, WHICH WAS THE ALLEGED SEDATIVE, IS NOT DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE IT WAS USED. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT SEDATED OR ANESTHETIZED, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN. SO, THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO WATCH. HE WAS BASICALLY BEING TORTURED. THERE WAS THE HOPE, ON OUR PART ANYWAY, THAT MEDICAL PERSONNEL THERE WOULD ATTEMPT TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECT OF THE DRUGS AND REVIVE HIM. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IS THEY JUST WAITED AROUND FOR HIM TO DIE, AND HE EVENTUALLY EXPIRED OF A HEART ATTACK. MR. LOCKETT'S CASE, IT WAS ONE SET OF INCOMPETENT ACTIONS AFTER ANOTHER, AND IT WAS A TOTAL DISASTER -- COMPLETE DISASTER. NEWS OF LOCKETT'S BOTCHED EXECUTION PUT A HARSH SPOTLIGHT ON THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA. OKLAHOMA GOVERNOR, MARY FALLIN, HAS ORDERED AN INDEPENDENT PROBE INTO THE STATE'S EXECUTION PROCEDURES, COMING AFTER TUESDAY'S BOTCHED EXECUTION OF INMATE CLAY LOCKETT. IN THE WAKE OF THE BOTCHED EXECUTION, THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REVISED ITS LETHAL-INJECTION PROTOCOLS. WE IMPROVED THE LIGHTING AS WELL AS THE SOUND SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN HERE. THESE CHANGES MOVE CHARLES WARNER AND RICHARD GLOSSIP CLOSER TO THEIR IMPENDING EXECUTIONS. RICHARD GLOSSIP'S LEGAL APPEALS WERE EXHAUSTED, BUT HE HAD ONE MORE CHANCE FOR SALVATION -- A CLEMENCY HEARING IN FRONT OF THE OKLAHOMA PARDON AND PAROLE BOARD. I THINK THOSE PEOPLE IN CLEMENCY, THEY WERE WAITING FOR AN APOLOGY. THEY WERE WAITING FOR RICH TO, AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS, SAY, YOU KNOW, "PLEASE DON'T KILL ME," AND SORT OF BEG FOR HIS LIFE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY I'M TRULY SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. VAN TREESE, BUT I DO ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I DID NOT PLAN AND I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE DEATH OF MR. VAN TREESE. HE'S SAYING, "LOOK -- I'M NOT INTERESTED IN CLEMENCY. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SOME PARDON FROM DEATH ROW RIGHT NOW. I DON'T BELONG IN PRISON. I DON'T BELONG IN PRISON AT ALL." PROSECUTORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS TESTIFIED IN FAVOR OF THE EXECUTION AND MADE A POINT OF REAFFIRMING THE EVIDENCE OF EMBEZZLEMENT. THE MOTIVE GOES STRAIGHT BACK TO RICHARD GLOSSIP, AND THAT'S WHAT THE COURTS HAVE FOUND. THAT'S WHAT THE PROOF SHOWS. GLOSSIP HAD $1,700 CASH ON HIM, $1,200 OF WHICH CAN NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR THROUGH LAWFUL MEANS, AND DONNA VAN TREESE TESTIFIED TO THE SHORTAGES ON THE BOOKS. IT'S ABOUT $6,100. I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS THE FIRST WITNESS AT BOTH OF THE TRIALS BECAUSE I HAD BEEN HIS BUSINESS PARTNER AS WELL AS HIS SPOUSE FOR 18 YEARS. IF ANYBODY EVER DESERVED TO BE EXECUTED, RICHARD GLOSSIP DESERVES IT. LET'S PUT THIS DEAL TO BED. IT'S YOUR DECISION. GOD BLESS YOU. CALL FOR THE VOTE. MRS. BRYCE? NO. MY VOTE IS NO. AND THEY SAID NO ON A FIVE-TO-NOTHING VOTE, AND SO HIS CLEMENCY PROCESS WAS OVER, AND ONCE THAT'S OVER, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT. THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO WAS TO SET AN EXECUTION DATE. ALL RIGHT, WE ARE ADJOURNED. GLOSSIP'S EXECUTION DATE WAS SET FOR JANUARY 29th, 2015, BUT FIRST, THERE WAS ANOTHER INMATE TO EXECUTE BEFORE THEY COULD KILL RICHARD GLOSSIP. AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT AT 10 WITH OKLAHOMA'S FIRST EXECUTION SINCE A LETHAL INJECTION WENT AWRY IN APRIL. CHARLES WARNER WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT 7:28 P.M. THIS EVENING. COMPARED TO LAST YEAR WITH CLAYTON LOCKETT, THIS WAS A RESOUNDING SUCCESS. SO, THE PATH WAS CLEAR. GLOSSIP WOULD BE EXECUTED IN TWO WEEKS. ** WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE. I LOVE CLERKS, AND I LOVE DOCUMENTS. YOU CAN'T CROSS-EXAMINE A DOCUMENT. WITH TIME RUNNING SHORT FOR GLOSSIP'S LEGAL TEAM TO GET BACK INTO COURT, THE PRESSURE IS ON INVESTIGATOR QUINN O'BRIEN TO UNCOVER NEW EVIDENCE. HER FOCUS TODAY IS MONEY, SPECIFICALLY THE FINANCIAL DEALINGS OF THE VICTIM, BARRY VAN TREESE. BARRY VAN TREESE IS THE NAME OF THE PERSON THAT I'M RESEARCHING TODAY. B- A-R-R-Y? LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND. GIVE US A SECOND. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE FIRST CASE IS RIGHT HERE. THE SECOND CASE WAS DESTROYED. SMALL CLAIMS WAS DESTROYED. OKAY. THESE RECORDS SHOW THAT BARRY VAN TREESE HAD DEBTS AND THAT PEOPLE BROUGHT HIM HERE TO COURT, TO CIVIL COURT, TO RECOVER THOSE DEBTS. AND I FOUND SOME TAX LIENS AGAINST THE BEST BUDGET INN FOR DELINQUENT TAXES. THESE DOCUMENTS ARE GOING TO START TO PUT TOGETHER A PICTURE OF THE FINANCES OF BARRY VAN TREESE, CORROBORATE WHAT SOME OF OUR WITNESSES HAVE BEEN SAYING. IF BARRY VAN TREESE WAS INDEED FACING TAX PROBLEMS, IT WOULD HELP TO EXPLAIN WHY HE MIGHT BE HOARDING CASH AND OPEN UP A FRESH SET OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MONEY PLAYED INTO THE MOTIVE BEHIND THE KILLINGS. I'M JUST RESEARCHING A COUPLE OF ADDRESSES. THE FIRST ONE IS... AS AN INVESTIGATOR, EVERY TIME I GET A NEW PIECE OF INFORMATION, I ADD A HUNDRED NEW QUESTIONS TO MY INVESTIGATION, AND EVERY TIME I HAVE ANSWERED ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS, IT'S BEEN IN RICHARD'S FAVOR. IN JANUARY OF 2015, RICHARD GLOSSIP'S EXECUTION DATE WAS FAST APPROACHING. HE WAS DEEP INTO THE BRUTAL 35-DAY PROTOCOL ON DEATH WATCH, AND HIS SENSE OF DESPERATION WAS GROWING DAY BY DAY. You have 60 seconds remaining. AS THE EXECUTION DATE GREW CLOSER, SISTER HELEN PREJEAN MARCHED PROTESTERS INTO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AT THE STATE CAPITAL, IT COULD BE CALLED A FINAL STAND. A FEW DOZEN PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR A MAN'S FATE THAT'S BEEN ALL BUT SEALED. SISTER HELEN CALLED ATTENTION TO RICHARD GLOSSIP'S NEW ROLE AS THE LEAD PLAINTIFF IN A SUPREME COURT CASE CHALLENGING OKLAHOMA'S USE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL LETHAL INJECTION DRUG, MIDAZOLAM. HER GOAL WAS TO STOP GLOSSIP'S EXECUTION WHILE A TEAM OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARGUED THE CASE. YES! RICHARD'S GOING TO LIVE, AND, GOD, IT'S SO HAPPY IN THERE. EVERYBODY'S TALKING AT ONE TIME. HELEN SAVED HIS LIFE IN JANUARY, BECAUSE THEY KILLED CHARLES WARNER, AND THEY HAD RICH ALL SET TO GO. HELEN GOT INVOLVED, AND SUDDENLY, THE MEDIA WAS ON IT. AND THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED TO GRANT THAT STAY. IT'S JUST ALL HAPPY, ALL JOYFUL. THE MOOD WAS MUCH DIFFERENT AT THE STATE HOUSE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RICHARD GLOSSIP CASE, HE'S BEEN FOUND GUILTY. HE'S BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON APPEAL. THERE'S BEEN NO PROBLEMS FOUND WITH THE ACTUAL TRIALS. OUT OF CONCERN THAT THE SUPREME COURT WOULD OUTLAW OKLAHOMA'S LETHAL-INJECTION SYSTEM, STATE REPRESENTATIVE JOHN PAUL JORDAN COSPONSORED A BILL TO GIVE HIS STATE AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF PUTTING INMATES LIKE RICHARD GLOSSIP TO DEATH. MEMBERS, HOUSE WILL COME TO ORDER. THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. MEMBERS, HOUSE BILL 1879 OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR ADMINISTERING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN OKLAHOMA. AN ENVIRONMENT OVERLY ENRICHED WITH NITROGEN WILL LACK THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OXYGEN NECESSARY FOR HUMAN SURVIVAL. NITROGEN HYPOXIA, ESSENTIALLY IT'S TAKING A MASK. IT'S HAVING THEM BREATHE IN NITROGEN. ANYONE CAN ADMINISTER IT. BASICALLY, THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES, THEY GO INTO A EUPHORIC STATE, AND THEN THEY'RE GONE. THE BILL PASSED BY A WIDE MARGIN... I DECLARE THE BILL TO HAVE PASSED. ...AND GOVERNOR FALLIN QUICKLY SIGNED IT INTO LAW. THREE MONTHS LATER, THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS RULING SAYING IN EFFECT THAT OKLAHOMA WAS FREE TO USE MIDAZOLAM TO LETHALLY INJECT RICHARD GLOSSIP. OKLAHOMA OFFICIALS MOVED QUICKLY. THEY SET SEPTEMBER 16th AS GLOSSIP'S SECOND DATE WITH THE DEATH CHAMBER. SO, THERE'S NOTHING TO STAND IN THE WAY NOW. WE DON'T HAVE THE ISSUE OF THE DRUGS. THEY HAD JUST SAID, "YEAH, THE DRUGS ARE FINE." WHAT COULD POSSIBLY SAVE HIM? AND THEN I CALLED SUSAN, AND THEN SUSAN AND I TOGETHER, WE DID THE MEDIA THING. THE FIGHT TO SAVE THE LIFE OF OKLAHOMA DEATH ROW INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP IS GAINING MOMENTUM. TOMORROW, DR. PHIL IS TAKING ON THE CASE OF GLOSSIP, AND HE'S BRINGING IN ACTRESS SUSAN SARANDON FOR THE DEBATE. WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR CLEMENCY, BUT JUST A STAY TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THIS OTHER INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE HADN'T SEEN BEFORE. I READ A LETTER FROM RICHARD WHICH WAS VERY UPSETTING. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. PLEASE KNOW THAT I AM PRAYING FOR YOU ALL. HE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE CASE ON THE AIR, AND THE WHOLE TIME, THE AUDIENCE WAS JUST SHAKING THEIR HEADS LIKE, "HOW COULD THIS BE?" RICHARD GLOSSIP WAS FAST BECOMING THE POSER CHILD FOR ABOLISHING THE DEATH PENALTY, BUT ALL THAT PUBLICITY SEEMED TO DO LITTLE FOR DON KNIGHT AND HIS EFFORTS TO EXONERATE HIS CLIENT. IT WAS A VERY, VERY FRANTIC SUMMER. WE USED THAT TIME TO GO GET MORE WITNESSES, AND I HAD TO TELL THEM, "IF YOU SIGN THIS AFFIDAVIT, YOUR NAME IS GOING TO BE PART OF THIS CASE." EACH OF THEM HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT THAT. IT WAS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK. THEN, 11 DAYS BEFORE HIS CLIENT'S IMPENDING EXECUTION, DON KNIGHT FINALLY GOT A BREAK. NOW, LATE THIS AFTERNOON, GLOSSIP'S ATTORNEYS INTRODUCED NEW EVIDENCE IN HOPES TO PROVE THEIR CLIENT'S INNOCENCE. THEY'RE AFFIDAVITS FROM JUSTIN SNEED'S FORMER CELLMATES. DETAILED IN THOSE DOCUMENTS, MICHAEL G. SCOTT SAID, "I CLEARLY HEARD JUSTIN SNEED SAY THAT, IN HIS STATEMENTS AND TESTIMONY, HE SET RICHARD GLOSSIP UP, AND THAT RICHARD GLOSSIP DID NOT DO ANYTHING." MICHAEL SCOTT SAW US ON "DR. PHIL," AND HE REACHED OUT AND CALLED OUR OFFICE. HE WAS BRAVE. HE WAS BRAVE. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO COME FORWARD. BUT THE OKLAHOMA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WITH DAVID PRATER DECIDED THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE OKAY FOR MICHAEL SCOTT TO HELP US. ** ON THE EVE OF THE SECOND EXECUTION, WE DID A PRESS CONFERENCE. THIS WAS AT THE TIME WHEN WE FILED OUR INFORMATION WITH THE OKLAHOMA COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS AND SAID WE WANTED A HEARING. IT WAS A VERY WELL-ATTENDED PRESS CONFERENCE. I MEAN, THERE WERE PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD. BUT I COULD SEE PRATER IN THE BACK, AND HE WAS ANGRY. THIS IS CRAP. THIS IS A **** P.R. CAMPAIGN. THAT'S ALL IT IS. IF IT WAS A **** P.R. CAMPAIGN, I GUESS I WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT AN AFFIDAVIT WITH ME. SEPTEMBER 16th, RICHARD GLOSSIP WAS IN THE FINAL HOLDING CELL ON DEATH WATCH. HE WAS PREPPED FOR EXECUTION, SERVED HIS LAST MEAL, AND JUST HOURS AWAY FROM DEATH. DON KNIGHT WAS NEARBY WAITING, HOPING THAT OKLAHOMA'S HIGHEST COURT WOULD GRANT HIM A HEARING TO PRESENT HIS NEW EVIDENCE. WE WAITED AND WAITED. AT NOON THERE CAME A KNOCK ON THE LITTLE DOOR WE WERE IN, AND THE GUARD POKED HIS HEAD IN AND SAID THERE'D BEEN A STAY THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED. IT WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE TO THINK WE DID IT, WE GOT THIS MAN A STAY. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY MICHAEL SCOTT WAS ARRESTED BY DEPUTIES WITH GUNS DRAWN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. AT THE POLICE STATION, MR. SCOTT, STILL IN HANDCUFFS, WAS PLACED IN A CHAIR IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM, AND OKLAHOMA DISTRICT ATTORNEY DAVID PRATER ENTERED THE ROOM AND BEGAN INTERROGATING MR. SCOTT. THEY TELL HIM THEY WANT HIM TO RECANT WHAT HE SAID, THAT IT'S NOT TRUE. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CHARGE HIM, AND THEY'RE GOING TO THROW HIM IN JAIL IF HE DOESN'T RECANT EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID IN THE AFFIDAVIT. AFTER WE HAD IDENTIFIED MICHAEL SCOTT AS A WITNESS IN OUR CASE, THEY SMEARED HIM. SOMEBODY GAVE PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTATION TO THE NEWSPAPER THE OKLAHOMAN, AND THE OKLAHOMAN RAN IT ON THEIR FRONT PAGE WITH A PICTURE OF MICHAEL SCOTT. THEY SAID, "HERE'S A MAN WHO HAS A HISTORY OF LYING." THERE WAS NO REASON FOR ANYBODY TO DO THAT. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THE OKLAHOMAN TO DO THAT. I RECEIVED A DOCUMENT THAT WAS MICHAEL SCOTT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION WHEN HE ENTERED THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. I, UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE I GOT THAT DOCUMENT. I UNDERSTAND THAT ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE WHERE I GOT IT, BUT I JUST CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT. I'M SORRY. NO COMMENT. AFTER ALL OF THE LAST MINUTE LEGAL BATTLING AND THE ENSUING MEDIA FIRESTORM, THE OKLAHOMA COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS HAD REACHED ITS DECISION. THEY WERE UNWILLING TO HEAR FROM DON KNIGHT'S NEW WITNESSES, INCLUDING MICHAEL SCOTT. GLOSSIP'S PETITION FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING WAS DENIED BY A VOTE OF THREE TO TWO. RICHARD GLOSSIP WAS GOING TO BE EXECUTED. HERE AT THE OKLAHOMA STATE PENITENTIARY, WE ARE STILL HOURS AHEAD OF THE ANTICIPATED TIME OF EXECUTION FOR INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP. OF COURSE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RICHARD GLOSSIP. HE IS EXPECTED TO DIE TODAY AT 3 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 30th, 2015, AFTER TWICE COMING WITHIN HOURS OF DEATH, RICHARD GLOSSIP WAS AGAIN SCHEDULED TO BE EXECUTED BY LETHAL INJECTION. THE OKLAHOMA COURT OF APPEALS HAD DENIED HIS LAWYER'S PETITION TO PRESENT NEW WITNESSES, SO GLOSSIP'S ONLY HOPE FOR COMING OUT ALIVE WAS A LEGAL MIRACLE -- A STAY FROM THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. I WAS BROUGHT IN WITH THE WITNESSES INTO THIS LITTLE HOLDING PLACE. YOU'RE BROUGHT IN AT 12:30. HE'S GOING TO BE EXECUTED AT 3, AND YOU START WAITING. BY MIDDAY, GLOSSIP'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS HAD GATHERED ALONGSIDE DOZENS OF REPORTERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHO ALL CAME TO DOCUMENT AN EXECUTION NEARLY 19 YEARS IN THE MAKING. AS WE WERE DRIVING OUT TO McALESTER, IT'S ABOUT A TWO-HOUR DRIVE FROM OKLAHOMA CITY, AND I HAD A HARD TIME THINKING I COULD WITNESS AN EXECUTION OF POSSIBLY AN INNOCENT PERSON. THEY SHUT DOWN THE PRISON. BASICALLY, YOU CAN'T COME IN OR OUT AFTER A CERTAIN POINT. I WAS WITH THE MEDIA, AND WE'RE ALL KIND OF SEQUESTERED IN THIS LITTLE FAMILY, SORT OF, VISITATION ROOM AND JUST SORT OF WAITING. MEANWHILE, INSIDE THE PRISON, THEY'RE PREPPING THE WHOLE SYSTEM. DON KNIGHT WAS ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WORD FROM THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO SEE IF THEY WOULD OVERTURN OKLAHOMA'S DECISION AND GIVE GLOSSIP ANOTHER SHOT IN FRONT OF A JUDGE. A LAST MINUTE PLEA TO SPARE THE LIFE OF RICHARD GLOSSIP, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DENIED THAT STAY IN A VOTE OF EIGHT TO ONE. IT WILL GO ON AS SCHEDULED. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO KILL HIM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. THERE WAS A LOT OF RICH'S FAMILY MEMBERS OUTSIDE, AND I HAD TO GO OVER AND TELL THEM THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAD TURNED US DOWN AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING MORE THAT WE COULD DO. THAT WAS A HORRIBLE FEELING. YOU KNOW, WE WERE HIS SISTERS OR BROTHERS, AND WE WERE JUST GOING TO DEFEND HIM NO MATTER WHAT, BUT IT WAS HORRIBLE. I DON'T EVER WANT TO FEEL LIKE THAT AGAIN. EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL IN COURT, EVERYONE KNOWS, THE WORLD KNOWS, THAT RICHARD GLOSSIP IS INNOCENT. THAT WAS A REALLY, REALLY HARD, HARD MOMENT FOR ME. EVERYTHING WAS MOVING FORWARD, AND RICHARD GLOSSIP SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO DEATH AT 3:00. EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF THAT PRISON, WE WERE JUST WAITING. IT WAS HORRIBLE, I MEAN, TO KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER OR YOUR BROTHER WAS, AT THAT MOMENT, BEING TAKEN FROM HIS CELL AND STRAPPED TO A GURNEY AND POISON WAS GOING TO BE INJECTED INTO HIS VEINS. SO, IT'S, LIKE, GETTING TO BE LATE AFTERNOON, AND EVERYBODY IN THE MEDIA ROOM IS LIKE, "WHAT IS GOING ON?" AND THERE STARTS TO BE THIS SORT OF PANIC. I'M LOOKING UP CLOSE AT MY WATCH. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR 3:00. I THOUGHT FOR SURE RICHARD WAS DEAD. AT ONE POINT IN TIME, I SAW AN AMBULANCE DRIVE UP, AND I THOUGHT, "MY GOD. THAT'S THE CAR THAT'S GOING TO TAKE HIM AWAY." AND NOW WE ARE GETTING WORD THAT THERE HAS BEEN A STAY OF EXECUTION GRANTED BY GOVERNOR MARY FALLIN. AGAIN, THIS IS A MAN WHO'S ALREADY HAD HIS LAST MEALS TWICE. IT'S A STAY FROM SOME LETHAL-INJECTION ISSUE. SOMETHING ABOUT OBTAINING ANOTHER DRUG TO DO THE EXECUTION. IT WAS LIKE LAZARUS, YOU KNOW, COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD, BECAUSE LITERALLY, WE HAD THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD 45 MINUTES. WE WERE JUST THRILLED THAT HE WAS ALIVE, OKAY? I MEAN, I WAS ABSOLUTELY THRILLED THAT HE WAS ALIVE, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY. WE ARE JUST NOW LEARNING, WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES, THAT THIS MAYBE A CASE OF A COMPLETELY ABSENTMINDED MIX-UP. THEY HAD POTASSIUM ACETATE. IT WAS THE WRONG DRUG. IT'S A FOOD PRESERVATIVE. IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A RICHARD GLOSSIP PRESERVATIVE BECAUSE HE'S NOT DEAD BECAUSE THEY MESSED IT UP. JESUS, WE THANK YOU. WE PRAISE YOU FOR THIS DAY, GOD. WE PRAISE YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL NEWS. HERE'S TO YOU, RICKY. ** IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE STORM OF CONTROVERSY THAT ERUPTED AFTER THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA NEARLY KILLED RICHARD GLOSSIP WITH THE WRONG DRUGS, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, SCOTT PRUITT, ISSUED A MORATORIUM ON NEW EXECUTIONS. WITHIN WEEKS, PRUITT CALLED A SPECIAL GRAND JURY TO INVESTIGATE THE ACTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IT'S JUST AFTER 2:00 THIS AFTERNOON, AND WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS GRAND-JURY REPORT TO BE FILED FOR QUITE SOME TIME. SEVEN MONTHS OF AN INVESTIGATION. MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGATIONS THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY GOT THE WRONG DRUG, THEY'VE ALL LEFT, AND SO, IT'S GOING TO BE TESTIMONY FROM ROBERT PATTON, THE FORMER HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, WHO HAS SINCE RESIGNED, ALSO ANITA TRAMMEL, THE WARDEN AT THE STATE PEN, WHO ALSO RESIGNED, AND SOME FOLKS INSIDE GOVERNOR MARY FALLIN'S OFFICE WHO WE UNDERSTAND ALSO TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF THE GRAND JURY. ** THE GRAND JURY HAS FINISHED ITS WORK, AND THE PRESS IS DETERMINED TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THE STATE'S OFFICIAL REPORT. GUYS, IF YOU JUST MIND WAITING RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY SOONER IF WE'RE ALL STANDING RIGHT HERE AT THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW. PLEASE? HERE'S WHAT THE GRAND JURY FOUND. DIRECTOR PATTON CHANGED THE EXECUTION PROTOCOL WITHOUT AUTHORITY, THE PHARMACIST ORDERED THE WRONG DRUGS, THERE WAS NO INSPECTION OF THE DRUGS, AND WARDEN ANITA TRAMMEL DIDN'T NOTIFY ANYONE. THE DEATH ROW CHIEF DIDN'T NOTICE THE WRONG DRUGS, AND THE GOVERNOR'S TOP ATTORNEY ADVOCATED TO PROCEED IN GLOSSIP'S EXECUTION WITH THE WRONG DRUGS. AND WHEN THE GRAND-JURY REPORT WAS PRESENTED IN COURT TODAY, THE JUDGE SAID, "IT'S TIME TO GET THE MONKEY BUSINESS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS UNDER CONTROL." AS FAR AS THE EXECUTION DRUGS, THE GRAND JURY DID RECOMMEND WE CHANGE OUR EXECUTION METHOD TO NITROGEN HYPOXIA. IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION'S ATTORNEY CALLED THE GOVERNOR AND SAID, "LOOK, GUYS, WE HAVE THE WRONG DRUG." IT APPEARS THAT THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR GOVERNOR FALLIN, STEVE MULLIN, SAID, "GO AHEAD. IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME DRUG," AND THEN LITERALLY SAYS, "GOOGLE IT," IN THIS GRAND-JURY REPORT AS TO WHAT HE SAID. SO, THE BIG NEWS HEADLINE TODAY IS EVERYONE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO PEOPLE AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE REALLY MESSED UP IN 2015, BUT NO ONE GOT INDICTED, AT THE END OF THE DAY. SO, NO ONE IS GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME IN THIS CASE, AND NOW THE CLOCK STARTS TICKING AGAIN FOR GLOSSIP. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A QUESTION IN YOUR MIND ABOUT THAT GRAND-JURY REPORT. WELL, I HAD A CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. THEY'RE DONE INVESTIGATING YOUR CASE. THAT REPORT IS IT. THERE WON'T BE ANYMORE GRAND-JURY INVESTIGATION INTO YOUR CASE. SO, WHAT'S NEXT? WHAT'S THAT? WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WITH THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING OKLAHOMA'S EXECUTION PROTOCOL DYING DOWN, STATE OFFICIALS BEGIN THE PROCESS OF ONCE AGAIN REBUILDING THEIR LETHAL-INJECTION SYSTEM. GLOSSIP WILL BE THE NEXT INMATE TO DIE IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA. IT COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS THE SUMMER OF 2017. HIS LEGAL TEAM HAS USED THIS SHORT WINDOW OF TIME TO POUR THROUGH OLD FILES, REVISIT THE CRIME SCENE, AND DIG UP WITNESSES THE POLICE AND PROSECUTION NEVER ATTEMPTED TO REACH. WE'RE GOING TO HEAD BACK TO THE HOTEL. WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO A FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT WHO IS SOMEONE WE'VE HIRED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE EXHIBITS AND INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR TRIAL COUNSEL. THE ALLEGATION IS THAT HE STOLE $6,100. PROSECUTORS FRAME THEIR CASE AROUND A PRIMARY MOTIVE -- MONEY. BUT DID GLOSSIP REALLY EMBEZZLE $6,100 FROM THE MOTEL, AND DID HE ACTUALLY SPLIT $4,000 WITH JUSTIN SNEED AFTER THE MURDER? WE LOOK AT THE FACTS, I MEAN, THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTATION, AND WE DON'T REALLY COME UP WITH AN OPINION. WE COME UP WITH A PRESENTATION OF THE FACTS. PAM KERR IS ONE OF THE LEADING FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS IN THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW AS A DEFENSE LAWYER IS, "WELL, IS THIS TRUE," BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO EMBEZZLEMENT, THEN THE WHOLE IDEA THAT HE KILLED BARRY BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OF BEING CAUGHT IN AN EMBEZZLEMENT JUST SIMPLY GOES OUT THE WINDOW, DOESN'T IT? EXACTLY. OKAY. SO, THE VERY FIRST DOCUMENT IS THE DAILY REPORT. THAT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU THE SALES FOR THE DAY AND THE CASH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE COLLECTED FOR THE DAY. OKAY, THE SECOND DOCUMENT IS THIS DAILY-SALES REPORT WHICH HAS THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT SHOULD BE DEPOSITED. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WOULD TELL SOMEBODY EVERY SINGLE DAY IF SOMEBODY IS STEALING. AND THOSE FACTS SHOW THAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY COLLECTED AND REPORTED BY RICHARD GLOSSIP AT THE BEST BUDGET INN MATCH THE HANDWRITTEN RECORDS KEPT BY BARRY VAN TREESE IN HIS MAKESHIFT BANK IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR. THE TOTAL FOR OCTOBER 23rd UNDER DEPOSIT IS $450. RIGHT UP HERE. THE SAME NUMBER UP HERE. YEP, THE EXACT SAME NUMBER. THE NEXT NUMBER IS $585. RIGHT. $1,552. RIGHT. $660. RIGHT. $515. RIGHT. PAM KERR PUT BOTH SETS OF NUMBERS INTO A SPREADSHEET AND MAKES A DISCOVERY THAT GLOSSIP'S ORIGINAL LAWYERS NEVER EVEN EXPLORED. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS TO BE DEPOSITED AND WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED. ZERO. ZERO. IT'S POWERFUL NEW EVIDENCE THAT COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE STATE'S CASE AT TRIAL. ESSENTIALLY, WHAT DONNA VAN TREESE SAYS IS, "I CALCULATED ALL OF THIS STUFF AT THE END OF THE YEAR, AND I SHOW THAT RICH WAS EMBEZZLING $6,100 FROM US." DONNA VAN TREESE'S COMPUTATION IS AN AVERAGE DAILY RENTAL TIMES THE NUMBER OF ROOMS FOR THE MONTH. THAT CALCULATION IS A PROJECTED FIGURE. IT'S NOT A REAL AMOUNT. IN OTHER WORDS, DONNA VAN TREESE, THE VICTIM'S WIDOW, GAVE THE PROSECUTION TWO SETS OF NUMBERS -- THE PROJECTED INCOME TOTALS AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL INCOME RECEIVED. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO NUMBERS IS $6,100. THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT AN EMBEZZLEMENT. IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR PROJECTIONS AND YOUR REVENUE. IT APPEARS FROM ALL INTENT AND PURPOSES THAT THERE WAS SIMPLY NO EMBEZZLEMENT HERE. RIGHT. A FIRST-YEAR ACCOUNTING STUDENT WOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS SCHEDULE AND SAY, "THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YOU'RE COMPARING PROJECTED REVENUE TO REAL REVENUE." THAT'S NOT A CALCULATION OF EMBEZZLEMENT. SO, WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION THAT YOU CAME TO? THAT MONEY WAS EMBEZZLED? BASED ON THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED, THERE WAS NO EMBEZZLEMENT. THAT MISCALCULATION IN THE HANDS OF THE PROSECUTION MAY HAVE COST RICHARD GLOSSIP HIS LIFE. AS FOR THE $4,000 STASHED UNDER THE CAR SEAT, PAM KERR WENT BACK TO THE MOTEL RECORDS AND DISCOVERED ANOTHER DISTURBING FLAW IN THE PROSECUTION'S CASE. JUSTIN SNEED HAS CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SPLIT $7,000, THEY WERE GOING TO SPLIT $4,000. WAS THERE THAT MONEY TO SPLIT ON THE EVENING OF HIS MURDER? FROM JANUARY 1st THROUGH JANUARY 5th, THE CASE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON HAND TO BE DEPOSITED, BASED ON OUR CALCULATIONS, WOULD HAVE BEEN $2,600 AT THE VERY MOST. THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THERE WASN'T $4,000 AS BEST YOU CAN TELL... CORRECT. ...FOR ANYBODY TO SPLIT $2,000 A PIECE. YEP. AND, OF COURSE, JUSTIN SNEED HAD ON HIM SOMEWHERE AROUND $1,700, DIDN'T HE? THAT'S WHAT I READ. JUSTIN SNEED IS THE ONLY SOURCE, FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL, THAT SAID RICH WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM MONEY TO KILL BARRY VAN TREESE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT. IT TOOK NEARLY 20 YEARS FOR THIS EVIDENCE TO BE REINVESTIGATED. SOMEDAY SOON, DON KNIGHT WILL PRESENT THESE AND OTHER FINDINGS TO A JUDGE. WHETHER THIS STOPS THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA FROM KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP IS ANYBODY'S GUESS. ** WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP? ME? I THINK ABOUT THE NEXT DAY AND WHAT I WANT TO DO. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO THINK ABOUT. THE PAST IS THE PAST, BUT I TRY TO PUT IT BEHIND ME AND TRY TO LOOK AT -- THE DAY IS MOVING FORWARD. WHAT I MIGHT ACCOMPLISH, WHAT I WANT TO DO, WHO I'M GOING TO REACH OUT TO, AND THE DIFFERENCE I'M GOING TO MAKE, BECAUSE I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE THIS DIFFERENCE JUST FOR ME. I'M TRYING TO MAKE THIS DIFFERENCE FOR INMATES EVERYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE INNOCENT AND NEED PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR THEM. TODAY, I'M MEETING A LOT OF OTHER EXONEREES WHO WERE ON DEATH ROW FOR MANY YEARS, AND THEY WILL BE TELLING THEIR STORIES, AND I HOPE, ONE DAY, RICHARD WILL BE ON THE STAGE WITH ME TELLING HIS STORY TO OTHER PEOPLE. THEY ARRESTED ME, TOOK ME DOWNTOWN. I WENT FROM THE COMFORTS OF MY HOME TO DEATH ROW IN 97 DAYS. I WANT TO INTRODUCE TO YOU NOW PARIS. PARIS POWELL WAS IN OKLAHOMA'S DEATH ROW FOR 161/2 YEARS AND THEN DISCOVERED TO BE INNOCENT AND FREED. AMERICA'S JUSTICE SYSTEM GOT IT WRONG 156 TIMES. I'M 138 ON THE EXONERATION LIST. I GOT RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2nd, 2009. THERE'S 156 PEOPLE NOW, SO THAT'S ANOTHER 18 SOULS THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN LOST. WHAT WAS IT LIKE ALL THOSE YEARS, YOU KNOW, IN AN OKLAHOMA PRISON FEELING THAT? WELL, PBHT, TERRIFYING, TORTUROUS, VERY DEPRESSING. ONE OF THE STORIES WE'RE ALSO FOCUSING ON BESIDES ALL YOU GUYS IS RICHARD GLOSSIP. HE'S MY GUY. YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT RICHARD. RICHARD GLOSSIP IS ONE OF THE MOST CARING, MOST CONSIDERATE GUYS THAT I MET ON DEATH ROW. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN YOUR MIND OF RICHARD GLOSSIP'S INNOCENCE? I'VE SEEN THE EYES OF A TRUE KILLER. I'VE SEEN THE DEMEANOR OF A TRUE KILLER. IF YOU MEET RICHARD GLOSSIP YOURSELF, YOU WILL SEE HE HAS THE MOST GENTLE SOUL OUT THERE. THE ONLY HOPE THAT HE WILL HAVE IS THROUGH CLEMENCY, AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYBODY WHO CAN HEAR MY VOICE AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S VOICE IS TO STEP UP FOR RICHARD GLOSSIP. HE DESERVES IT. APPRECIATE IT. I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING. NEXT TIME YOU TALK TO GLOSSIP, LET HIM KNOW P. ROCK SAID, "WHAT'S UP?" YOU FEEL ME? TO KEEP HIS HEAD UP. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PUSHING FOR HIM, ALL RIGHT? THANKS, MAN. ** IT'S HARD FOR ME BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO GET OUT, AND HE WANTS TO BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOON. AS HIS LAWYER, I CAN'T BE THAT SURE. I CAN'T TELL HIM THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I KNOW, FOR HIM, THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER THAT HE WANTS TO HEAR. AND I ALSO KNOW FROM HIM THAT THAT'LL SIT WITH HIM OKAY FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE, AND THEN TOMORROW HE'LL HAVE THE SAME QUESTION. HE'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, AND I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW. I'M AN OPTIMISTIC PERSON, AND I THINK THAT WE'LL GET THERE. ** I AM IN A LIFE-CURRENT WITH RICHARD GLOSSIP, AND I BELIEVE HE IS NOT GOING TO DIE. THIS IS AN EXODUS STORY. THIS IS A STORY OF LIFE UP AGAINST DEATH, OF AN INNOCENT MAN, AND I'M HOPEFUL ABOUT RICHARD GLOSSIP. I'M HOPEFUL THAT HE IS GOING TO LIVE. I WORRY ABOUT HIM. I THINK ABOUT HIM EVERY DAY. THERE'S NOT A DAY GOES BY I DON'T THINK ABOUT HIM AND ABOUT HOW HE FEELS AND IF HE'S SMILING TODAY OR IF HE'S NOT SMILING, BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS SMILING. BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY REASON WHY HE WOULD RIGHT NOW. I REALLY DON'T. I DON'T THINK, THAT FROM ALL THE HEARINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD AND ALL THE APPEALS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND DENIED, THAT HE IS GOING TO SURVIVE. I THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD KILL HIM BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IN SOME SCENARIOS, WHY SHOULD THEY KILL HIM WHEN THEY'RE NOT KILLING ME? AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH JUST BEING TORN BECAUSE I CAN'T PICK EVERYBODY'S SIDE, AND I CAN'T NOT HURT THE VAN TREESE FAMILY AND AT THE SAME TIME SAVE HIM WITH THE TRUTH. BUT AT THIS POINT I JUST SIMPLY HAVE TO FORGIVE HIM AND MOVE ON. DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DIE IN THIS PLACE? DO I THINK, PERSONALLY? NO. YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH THE THREE TIMES, IF THAT DOESN'T ENCOURAGE PEOPLE THAT HOPE EXISTS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD. AND IT'S DEFINITELY ENCOURAGED ME, THOUGH, THAT HOPE EXISTS AND THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE FOR THE JUDGES TO FINALLY DO THE RIGHT THING. I'M A FIGHTER, AND I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP LIKE THAT. I WON'T GIVE UP UNTIL MY FINAL BREATH. I NEVER WILL. IF I SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THAT I THINK I'M GOING TO DIE, I'VE LOST HOPE, AND I'LL NEVER LOSE HOPE.
