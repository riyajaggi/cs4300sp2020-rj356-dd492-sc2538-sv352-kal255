 YOU KNOW, WE WATCHED YOUR INTERROGATION TAPE. I MEAN, WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE BROUGHT INTO THAT ROOM AND JUST BE CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT? HE THINKS THAT'S GONNA WORK, THAT HE'S NOT INVOLVED, JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO THE KILLIN'. BUT WHEN YOU PLAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU'RE MORE INVOLVED THAN THE ACTUAL KILLER. THE STUFF HE'S SAYIN' IS JUST -- THAT GUY IS SUCH A LIAR. JUST -- HE WOULDN'T KNOW THE TRUTH IF IT HIT HIM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.

 ** IN OKLAHOMA, DEATH ROW INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP IS LIVING ON BORROWED TIME. ALREADY, HE'S BEEN ON THE BRINK OF EXECUTION ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. NOW, ONCE AGAIN, THE STATE IS PREPARING TO PUT HIM TO DEATH, ON CHARGES OF HIRING ANOTHER MAN TO COMMIT MURDER. BUT FAR TOO MANY TROUBLING QUESTIONS SWIRL AROUND HIS CASE. I'M NOT IN THIS THING, MAN! I'M REALLY NOT. I'M JOE BERLINGER. AS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, I'VE SPENT MY CAREER SHINING A LIGHT ON STORIES OF INJUSTICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? THEY'RE READY TO KILL THIS GUY.

 I THINK IT'S A REAL BAD DEAL. AS GLOSSIP'S LAWYERS SEARCH FOR NEW EVIDENCE... EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH HAPPENED RIGHT HERE. ...TIME IS RUNNING OUT. DID THE SYSTEM GET IT WRONG WITH RICHARD GLOSSIP? IT'S AN INNOCENT MAN WHO'S GONNA EXECUTED IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW. WE ARE THE LAST, BEST CHANCE THAT RICH HAS, AND WE HAVE TO SUCCEED BECAUSE, IF WE FAIL, HE DIES. WHY IS OKLAHOMA SO HELLBENT ON KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP? IN SEPTEMBER OF 2015, RICHARD GLOSSIP RECEIVED HIS THIRD STAY OF EXECUTION. NOW, HE IS POTENTIALLY JUST MONTHS AWAY FROM YET ANOTHER EXECUTION DATE. HIS ONLY REAL HOPE OF GETTING BACK INTO COURT IS FOR HIS LAWYERS TO FIND HARD PROOF OF HIS INNOCENCE. YOU KNOW, WHENEVER I'M DOING AN INVESTIGATION, REALLY, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FOR ME TO DO IS TO GO AND SEE WHERE IT HAPPENED. BUT PROVING A MAN'S INNOCENCE 20 YEARS AFTER THE FACT IS A NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE MISSION, ESPECIALLY IN A CASE THAT LACKS SIGNIFICANT FORENSIC EVIDENCE, SO GLOSSIP'S LEGAL TEAM HAS TRAVELED TO OKLAHOMA TO SEE WHAT EVIDENCE THEY CAN UNCOVER. HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR LETTING US GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WE'RE LOOKIN' TO SEE ROOM 102, IF WE CAN. - OKAY. ** GOSH, THIS IS NOT A VERY BIG SPACE FOR WHAT HAPPENED. IT ISN'T, IS IT? IT'S UNSETTLING THAT, I MEAN, THIS IS EXACT SPOT A MAN WAS KILLED. THAT'S HORRIBLE. IN A HORRIBLE WAY. - IT'S SAD. - YES, IT IS. WE REALLY CAN'T LOSE PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. THE THING THAT'S EVEN SADDER THAN THAT IS TRYING TO THINK OF THE STATE KILLING ANOTHER INNOCENT MAN BECAUSE OF IT. THE JOB OF A POLICE INVESTIGATOR, THE JOB OF A DETECTIVE, IS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. SO, IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO INVESTIGATION. YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO DO THE WORK. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS, EVEN IN THE REPORTS, THAT HAPPENED BACK THEN THAT DIDN'T MATCH UP. THE GLOSSIP CASE WAS REALLY, REALLY BIZARRE TO ME BECAUSE, AS A REPORTER, YOU GET WHAT THE POLICE SAY, BUT THEN YOU START HAVIN' SOME QUESTIONS. YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR DETAILS AND AFFIDAVITS AND ARREST WARRANTS. DETAILS THAT THE POLICE PROVIDE, THAT SAY, "THIS GUY DID IT. HERE'S THE EVIDENCE," AND THAT WASN'T HERE. AND THEN YOU FIND OUT HOW MANIPULATIVE THAT THE DETECTIVES WERE. MY REACTION TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEFENDING RICHARD GLOSSIP AS BEING INNOCENT, THEY DIDN'T SEE WHAT HE CAUSED TO HAPPEN TO THE VICTIM, BARRY VAN TREESE. IF THEY ONLY KNEW THE BRUTALITY THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THIS HOMICIDE, IF THEY ONLY UNDERSTOOD ALL THE FACTORS THAT WERE INVOLVED, I WONDER IF THEY WOULD STILL STAND UP FOR HIM. I WAS A DETECTIVE IN THE OKLAHOMA CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT'S HOMICIDE UNIT, SO I WAS AN INSPECTOR AND MY PARTNER ALSO, BILL COOK, WAS AN INSPECTOR. WE WORKED TOGETHER FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND I THINK WE RESOLVED SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO 95% OF OUR CASELOAD. OUR LIEUTENANT HAD CALLED ME AND ADVISED THAT WE HAD A CRIME SCENE AT THE BEST BUDGET INN, THAT WAS LOCATED OUT ON COUNCIL ROAD. **** MR. VAN TREESE WAS LAYING NEXT TO THE BED. YOU COULD SEE WHERE THE SHADES HAD BEEN RUFFLED A LITTLE BIT AND THE GLASS HAD BEEN BROKEN OUT IN THE WINDOW AND IT WAS JUST TYPICAL OF A SCUFFLE IN THERE. BEMO INTERVIEWED A FEW MOTEL EMPLOYEES AND GUESTS AT THE SCENE. JUSTIN SNEED'S NAME CAME UP, BUT HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. SO BEMO TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO RICHARD GLOSSIP. HE'S THE MANAGER OF THE MOTEL AND HE'S THE ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON OUT THERE AND HE KNOWS BARRY VAN TREESE. THIS IS THE PERSON THAT YOU JUST WANNA TALK TO AND SEE WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY. AT THE SCENE, BEMO GREW INCREASINGLY SUSPICIOUS OF GLOSSIP. GLOSSIP HAD MADE SEVERAL INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS TO BRING SUSPICION ON HIMSELF. HE'D GET DATES WRONG. HE APPEARED TO BE NERVOUS AND, AS WE TALKED TO HIM, I JUST FELT LIKE HE KNEW A LOT MORE THAN WHAT HE WAS SAYING BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE WAS ACTING. ACCORDING TO POLICE REPORTS, GLOSSIP TOLD MOTEL SECURITY MAN CLIFF EVERHART AND PATROL OFFICER TIM BROWN DIFFERENT STORIES ABOUT WHEN HE HAD LAST SEEN BARRY. SO THE POLICE SAY YOU GAVE CONFLICTING STATEMENTS. YOU TOLD TIM BROWN YOU SAW BARRY WALKING THROUGH THE PARKING LOT AT 7:00 THAT MORNING. YOU TOLD CLIFF EVERHART THAT YOU SAW BARRY RETURN TO THE HOTEL. I MEAN -- - NO, EVERYBODY ASKED ME WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I SEEN BARRY. WHEN THEY ASKED ME WHEN I'D SEEN BARRY, 7:30 THE NIGHT BEFORE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD THEM. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD BEMO AND TIM BROWN. THEY DECIDED I WAS MAKING CONFLICTING STATEMENTS. I NEVER SAID I SEEN HIM THAT MORNING, AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID, FROM DAY ONE, THAT IT WAS 7:30 THE NIGHT BEFORE. YOU SEE THEM COMING AFTER RICHARD RIGHT AWAY, HARD, BUT YOU CAN KIND OF SEE A THREAD, A TRAIN OF THOUGHT THAT THEY'RE ALREADY HAVING. AND THEN AS IT PROGRESSES, THAT TRAIN OF THOUGHT BECOMES THE NARRATIVE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU KIND OF GET A TUNNEL VISION GOING ON. THE THING ABOUT IT IS, IS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO CONCOCT A STORY. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HIS STORY IS RIGHT OFF THE BAT, AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE HIM DOWN THERE. THEY KEEP SAYING, "WE'RE GONNA FIND JUSTIN." AND THEY KEEP ASKING HIM, "DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?" HE SAYS, "NO, BUT I WISH I DID. HE'S YOUR GUY." BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY JUST REALLY COULD NOT STOP LOOKING AT GLOSSIP. LIKE I SAID, HE'S VERY ARROGANT AND VERY COCKY. HE WAS ONE OF THOSE KIND OF GUYS THAT REALLY IRRITATES YOU, YOU KNOW, WITH HIS COMEBACKS AND WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYIN', AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD GET IN FACE SOMETIMES, "WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, BUDDY," OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE HE IRRITATED ME A LITTLE BIT. IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'RE NOT REALLY EVEN LISTENING TO WHAT HE'S SAYING NECESSARILY... WHICH SUGGESTS TO ME A LEVEL OF TUNNEL VISION AND FOCUS ON RICHARD GLOSSIP THAT IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR RICHARD TO OVERCOME. I WANT TO GET REAL SPECIFIC ON THE DAY AND WHAT HAPPENED. JUSTIN SAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU CAME INTO HIS ROOM, TOLD HIM TO GO KILL BARRY WITH A BASEBALL BAT. WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE. JUSTIN KNOWS THAT'S NOT TRUE. SO WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY DOING DURING THIS TIME PERIOD? WERE YOU ASLEEP, OR WHAT WAS GOING ON? D'ANNA AND I WENT TO BED AROUND MIDNIGHT. AND, THE NEXT THING I KNOW, SHE WOKE ME UP AND TOLD ME SOMEBODY WAS BEATING ON THE DOOR, SO I GOT UP TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND IT WAS JUSTIN. AND D'ANNA EVEN TOLD DETECTIVES THIS AND EVEN TESTIFIED TO THAT, AND THEY JUST WASN'T GONNA LISTEN. D'ANNA, IN HER STATEMENT, BASICALLY ALIBIED FOR RICH, WHERE HE WAS, WHEN HE WAS WITH HER, AND YET THE POLICE CHOSE TO IGNORE THAT. WHEN WE FIRST COME ACROSS D'ANNA WOOD, WE ASKED GLOSSIP WHO SHE WAS AND HE SAID THAT SHE WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND THAT SHE LIVED WITH HIM AND SHE HELPED HIM RUN THE MOTEL. I DO BELIEVE GLOSSIP KEPT HER OUT OF THIS. I WAS CONVINCED, YOU KNOW, HE WASN'T TELLING US THE TRUTH. JUST COULDN'T PROVE IT, YOU KNOW. AT THAT MOMENT, ANYWAY. AND SO, BY AND LARGE, ONCE WE FINISHED THIS INTERVIEW, WE LET HIM GO AND THOUGHT, "WELL, THERE'LL BE ANOTHER DAY." ** WHEN I GOT BACK THAT NIGHT FROM MY INTERVIEW, THERE WAS A LADY SITTING AT THE DESK AND I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS A FRIEND OR A FAMILY MEMBER OF THE VAN TREESES, AND SHE PULLS ME ASIDE AND SHE SAYS, "ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO TALK TO THEM AGAIN?" AND I SAID, "YES," AND SHE GOES, "DON'T TALK TO THEM WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS CAN GET TWISTED," IS WHAT SHE TOLD ME. AND WHEN SHE SAID THAT, THAT'S WHEN I STARTED THINKIN', "MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO AN ATTORNEY." WE HAD HEARD THAT RICHARD WAS TRYING TO GET RID OF HIS STUFF SO HE COULD LEAVE TOWN, SO WE ASKED A COUPLE OF GUYS FROM SPECIAL PROJECTS TO WATCH HIM. BUT WHILE THE COPS BELIEVED GLOSSIP WAS SELLING HIS POSSESSIONS IN ORDER TO FLEE, HE TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY. YES, I STARTED SELLING EVERYTHING, BUT THE ONLY REASON I DID THAT WAS TO GET THAT ATTORNEY, DAVID McKENZIE. I WAS THE FIRST LAWYER THAT RICHARD GLOSSIP SPOKE WITH. I TELL EVERYBODY THAT COMES UNDER MY CHARGE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT TALK TO THE POLICE. AND SO I CALLED THE POLICE AND SAID, "HE'S NOT GOING TO COOPERATE WITH YOU ANY FURTHER." HE WALKED OUT OF MY OFFICE, GOT IN THE ELEVATOR, WENT DOWNSTAIRS. WHEN HE OPENED THE FRONT DOOR, GUNS WERE DRAWN AND HE WAS PLACED UNDER ARREST. FOR THE SECOND TIME, GLOSSIP AGREES TO TALK TO THE POLICE WITHOUT LEGAL COUNSEL. OKAY, RICHARD. GLOSSIP TELLS BEMO HIS VERSION OF EVENTS AGAIN. HOWEVER, GLOSSIP'S ACCOUNT OF WHAT TOOK PLACE THAT NIGHT HAS ONE, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. TELL ME AGAIN WHAT JUSTIN SAID. WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE, HE SAID, "I KILLED BARRY." AND HE ALWAYS MADE JOKES OF ONE TYPE OR ANOTHER, SO, WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM, THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE AND STUFF, I JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM. - SO YOU THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING. - EXACTLY, LIKE HE ALWAYS DID. BUT ONCE YOU'RE IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM, IT WAS A MISTAKE NOT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT JUSTIN HAD SAID. SO TAKE ME THROUGH YOUR THINKING ABOUT WHY YOU DECIDED TO WITHHOLD THAT INFORMATION, 'CAUSE THAT'S A BIG ONE, YOU KNOW? THAT'S A BIG -- - NO, IT REALLY IS. I WAS GONNA TELL THEM, UNTIL DETECTIVE BEMO STARTED ACCUSIN' ME OF THINGS, BUT, WHEN I GOT TO THAT POINT, I'M SITTING THERE, GOING, "SOMETHING'S REALLY WRONG HERE," AND IT MADE ME NERVOUS TO SAY ANYTHING, AT THAT POINT, TO THEM. - RIGHT. I JUST STARTED NOT TRUSTING THEM. - YEAH. - IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE SMARTEST DECISION I MADE. I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT. AND I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, "IF STUPID IS A CRIME, THEN I'M GUILTY." YEAH, THAT'S BAD. BUT, I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES HIM A CAPITAL-MURDER DEFENDANT. I THINK THAT MIGHT MAKE HIM AN ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT. THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN PROVE. THAT'S WHAT HE'S ADMITTED TO. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO FORENSIC EVIDENCE, WHATSOEVER, THAT WOULD PUT RICHARD GLOSSIP INSIDE ROOM 102 AT ANY POINT DURING THIS PERIOD. NOT ANY SIGN OF HIM. BUT THERE'S DNA FROM JUSTIN SNEED ALL OVER THE ROOM. TO OFFICIALLY CHARGE GLOSSIP, THE POLICE WOULD NEED MORE EVIDENCE. THEY WOULD NEED TO FIND JUSTIN SNEED. PROBABLE CAUSE WAS ENOUGH THAT WE COULD HOLD GLOSSIP FOR THAT MURDER, AND, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE A FEW DAYS BEFORE YOU FILE YOUR CHARGES. FORTUNATELY, WE WERE ABLE TO LOCATE JUSTIN SNEED AND HE WAS ABLE TO TELL US THE STORY AS IT HAPPENED AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID. ** WITH NO FORENSIC EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS GLOSSIP WAS PRESENT INSIDE ROOM 102 ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER, POLICE WOULD RELY HEAVILY ON JUSTIN SNEED'S TESTIMONY TO BUILD THEIR CASE AGAINST GLOSSIP. IT'S ONE MAN'S WORD AGAINST ANOTHER, AND THE WHOLE CASE PIVOTS ON WHETHER OR NOT SNEED'S STORY CAN BE BELIEVED. MY NAME IS JUSTIN SNEED AND WE'RE AT JOSEPH HARP CORRECTIONAL CENTER IN OKLAHOMA. AND HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE? I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE NOVEMBER OF 1999. JUSTIN SNEED CAME TO OKLAHOMA CITY FROM TEXAS IN JULY OF 1996, LEAVING TWO YOUNG KIDS BEHIND. WITHIN WEEKS, HE PICKED UP WORK AS A MAINTENANCE MAN AT THE BEST BUDGET INN. I'D BEEN AT THE BEST BUDGET INN SINCE LATE JULY, AND THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER. THEN, THAT'S WHEN MR. GLOSSIP WAS ASKIN' ME OR APPROACHIN' ME ABOUT KILLING MR. VAN TREESE FOR MONEY, AND IT WAS IN JANUARY WHEN THE MURDER HAPPENED. FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS, HE WAS ASKING YOU TO KILL? YEAH. I KEPT TELLING HIM NO, I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. AND WHAT WAS THE PLAN, YOU KNOW, LIKE DID HE GIVE YOU A PLAN? HE KNEW MS. VAN TREESE PRETTY GOOD AND HE THOUGHT THAT, WITH MR. VAN TREESE OUT OF THE PICTURE, THAT HE COULD MANIPULATE HER. THEY HAD MULTIPLE MOTELS AND THAT HE WOULD SET ME UP IN RUNNIN' ONE OF THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THAT NIGHT, BEFORE I'D CRASHED OUT AND WENT TO SLEEP, I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER IF I HAD SMOKED SOME MARIJUANA. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT I COULD'VE BECAUSE I WAS STONED MOST OF THE TIME I WAS AT THAT MOTEL. I WAS ASLEEP IN MY ROOM WHEN MR. GLOSSIP CAME TO MY BEDROOM. OF COURSE, HE HAD MASTER KEYS, SO ALL I DO IS REMEMBER WAKING UP TO HIM BEING, YOU KNOW, IN MY FACE. HE JUST BECAME REAL ADAMANT ABOUT HOW MR. VAN TREESE HAD JUST SHOWED UP AND, UM, THAT HE WAS WILLIN' TO UP THE MONEY TO $7,500, IF I WOULD GO KILL HIM THEN. AND I WAS KIND OF BEIN' ADAMANT AGAINST IT, JUST KIND OF SHAKIN' MY HEAD. YOU KNOW, HE'S STANDIN' THERE, POKIN' HIS FINGER AT ME AND TRYIN' TO TELL ME TO JUST GO DO IT AND BEIN' REAL AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT. I CAN'T FIGURE OUT EXACTLY AT WHAT POINT I DECIDED TO JUST GRAB THE BAT AND GO OVER THERE. I JUST REMEMBER GOING OVER THERE AND OPENING THE DOOR. WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, THE MURDER ITSELF? I- I DON'T REALLY WANNA SPEAK ON THAT, AS FAR AS, UM, WHAT I ACTUALLY DID. I'M STILL TRYING TO SOAK A LOT OF THAT IN AND I... AND I REALLY ONLY FEEL IN MY HEART THAT I WOULD REALLY ONLY WANT TO SPEAK ON THAT IF THE WIDOW CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW. AND THEN I WOULDN'T HOLD NOTHIN' BACK FROM HER. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS? I JUST WANT 'EM TO KNOW THAT I'M STANDIN' ON THE TRUTH FOR A PURPOSE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN STAND RIGHT NOW, IS ON THE TRUTH. JUSTIN SNEED STANDS BY WHAT HE CLAIMS TO BE THE TRUTH. BUT HOW DOES THE STORY HE TELLS TODAY STAND UP TO HIS INITIAL CONFESSION? THE OKLAHOMA CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT, THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF THEIR HIGH ARREST AND CONVICTION RATE. WHATEVER IT TOOK TO MAKE AN ARREST, THEY WOULD DO. IN 1982, WHEN I CAME TO WORK IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, BOB MACY WAS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. HE HAD MORE DEATH-PENALTY CONVICTIONS THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER PROSECUTOR IN THE COUNTRY. HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THAT FACT. SO IT LENT ITSELF TO A ENVIRONMENT, I BELIEVE, WHERE DREAM CONFESSIONS WERE IN VOGUE AND THAT'S I THINK WHAT HAPPENED TO SNEED. THEY ALREADY BELIEVE THAT RICHARD BASICALLY COMPELLED JUSTIN SNEED TO KILL BARRY VAN TREESE. AND SO WHEN THEY GET SNEED IN THE ROOM, THEY LEAD HIM EXACTLY DOWN THE PATH OF WHERE THEY WANT TO GO. I WANTED HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE KNEW OTHER PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THIS, AND UNLESS HE WAS WILLING TO LET US KNOW WHO THEY WERE, HE WAS GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE RAP. AND IT WASN'T ANY TASK TO BREAK JUSTIN DOWN BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE A VERY STRONG WILL TO BEGIN WITH. WELL... BEFORE SNEED EVEN CONFESSES TO THE MURDER, DETECTIVE BEMO OFFERS UP RICHARD GLOSSIP BY NAME. WELL -- HE DOESN'T EVEN GET A STORY FROM SNEED, ESSENTIALLY, BEFORE HE SAYS, "WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO THIS ALONE," AND THEN, "DID YOU KNOW THAT RICH HAS BEEN ARRESTED, TOO?" WHICH, OF COURSE, SNEED DID NOT KNOW AT THAT TIME. JUSTIN'S FIRST STATEMENT THAT HE MADE TO POLICE NEVER INCLUDED ME IN ANYTHING. I WAS NEVER INCLUDED UNTIL BEMO AND THEM PUT THAT THOUGHT IN HIS MIND. SNEED COMES UP WITH A DREAM CONFESSION. BUT THOSE FACTS WERE INTERJECTED EARLY ON IN THE INTERROGATION PROCESS. HE TOLD US THAT RICHARD CAME AND TOLD HIM THAT BARRY WAS IN ROOM 102 AND THAT HE COULD GO IN THERE AND STEAL HIS CAR KEYS AND -- AND THEY COULD GET THE MONEY. I DECIDED TO TRUST HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO KEEP THEIR WORD AND THEY WERE GOING TO HELP ME AND -- AND, BY HELPING ME, I REALLY THOUGHT IN MY OWN MIND THAT THEY WERE GONNA ALLOW ME TO GO HOME. FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL, WITH THE HELP OF POLICE OFFICERS, JUSTIN SNEED SIMPLY MADE UP A STORY TO HELP HIMSELF. DON KNIGHT BELIEVES THE POLICE INVESTIGATION IN GLOSSIP'S CASE LEAVES MANY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED. CERTAINLY, BEMO IS A SUCCESSFUL HOMICIDE DETECTIVE, BUT IN RECENT YEARS, SOME OF HIS CASES HAVE BEEN REVIEWED, AND CONVICTIONS OVERTURNED. I'M NOT AT ALL WORRIED. I MEAN, THEY CAN GO THROUGH ANY REVIEWS THEY WANT AND, IF THEY DO THAT, THAT'S THEIR DECISIONS. I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING THAT I FELT WAS WRONG, AND I'VE NEVER PUT ANYBODY IN JAIL THAT DIDN'T BELONG THERE. IF THEY WOULD'VE DONE THEIR JOB, I WOULDN'T HAVE SPENT A DAY IN JAIL. THEY JUST... WANTED TO CLEAR THIS THING UP AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE, AND IT WAS EASIER TO GET ME 'CAUSE I WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. AND THAT'S THE SAD THING ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM: YOU DON'T NEED EVIDENCE. YOU CAN JUST COME IN WITH A STORY, CONVINCE THEM, AND YOU GOT 'EM. ** I WANNA START OUR MEETING WHERE I THINK EVERYTHING REALLY BEGINS IN THIS CASE, WHICH IS THE INVESTIGATION. AND I THINK WHAT WE DUG INTO HERE PRETTY QUICKLY WAS THE FACT THAT THERE JUST WASN'T A WHOLE LOT THAT WAS DONE. WITH A POSSIBLE EXECUTION DATE FOR RICHARD GLOSSIP JUST MONTHS AWAY, DON KNIGHT HAS RETAINED QUINN O'BRIEN, A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WHO SPECIALIZES IN DEATH-PENALTY CASES. THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION LEFT TOO MANY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED FOR ME. WHY ARE WE BELIEVING JUSTIN SNEED? WHY DID THE POLICE NOT CANVASS THE HOTEL? EITHER THERE ARE POLICE DOCUMENTS MISSING, THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THEY MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IF POLICE EVER TALKED TO THESE PEOPLE IS TO GO TALK TO GUESTS OF THE BEST BUDGET INN OURSELVES. SO THIS IS THE SHEET OF PAPER THAT MARKS DOWN WHO'S STAYING IN WHAT ROOM THE WEEK OF JANUARY 1st THROUGH THE 7th. THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US JUST, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS THERE. WHAT DID THEY SEE? THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH ALL OF HIS LEGAL OPTIONS EXHAUSTED. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICES AT THIS POINT EXCEPT FOR TO KNOCK ON EVERY SINGLE DOOR WE CAN KNOCK ON AND HOPE THAT WE FIND SOMETHING. SO WHAT HAPPENED? A WOMAN ANSWERED THE DOOR AND SHE SAID THAT SHE IS NOT THE PERSON THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR. ** DO YOU REMEMBER ANYBODY AT ALL, ANYBODY IN ANY ROOMS THAT YOU CAN RECALL AT ALL? - NO, SIR. - OKAY. - A WOMAN ANSWERED AND SHE WAS -- - SHE SHUT THE DOOR BEFORE WE COULD ASK. - YEAH, SHE WAS REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN TALKING TO US. ** NO LUCK THERE. NOBODY WAS HOME HERE. YEAH, NO ONE HOME. SO WHERE ARE WE HEADED NOW? WELL, WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY THAT JUSTIN SNEED HAS IDENTIFIED AS SOMEBODY THAT HE KNEW BACK IN THE DAY, ROGER LEE RAMSEY, WHO WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN JAIL WITH SNEED IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS ARREST. AND WE CAN'T REALLY SAY AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT IT'S GOING TO DRAW SOME DIRECT LINE TO INNOCENCE, BUT IT'S THE TOUGH SPADEWORK THAT WE'RE DOING. YOU KEEP DIGGIN'. WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT IT, THERE WERE PLENTY OF LEADS THAT COULD'VE BEEN PURSUED. BUT BEMO AND COOK THOUGHT THEY HAD THEIR MAN AND THERE WAS NOT GONNA BE ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION, WHATSOEVER. THEY HEARD WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR FROM SNEED, THEY GO TO GET GLOSSIP, AND THEN HE'S ON DEATH ROW BECAUSE OF THAT. OF COURSE, AFTER DOIN' THE INTERVIEWS WITH GLOSSIP AND WITH JUSTIN SNEED, I FELT THE MOTIVE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WAS AS SIMPLE AS A ROBBERY AND THE FACT THAT RICHARD GLOSSIP WANTED TO TAKE OVER THE MOTEL AS HIS OWN. BEMO AND COOK BUILT A CASE OF MURDER-FOR-HIRE, A CAPITAL OFFENSE IN OKLAHOMA, AGAINST GLOSSIP. YOU COULD TALK TO JUSTIN AND YOU JUST KNEW THIS KID WAS NOT SMART ENOUGH TO PLAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T THAT WE COERCED HIM INTO SAYING GLOSSIP. GLOSSIP WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND IT. ACCORDING TO THE DETECTIVES, GLOSSIP MANIPULATED SNEED INTO COMMITTING THIS MURDER. IT'S HARD FOR YOU AND I TO REALIZE THAT GLOSSIP HAD THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE OVER SNEED, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE. I ACTUALLY FELT SORRY FOR HIM. THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID VERY OFTEN TOWARD SUSPECTS AND MURDERERS. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, RICHARD GLOSSIP HAD QUITE A HOLD OVER YOU. I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I WAS THAT VULNERABLE AND MEEK AND HE WAS JUST A CONSTANT VOICE, UM, AND -- GUIDANCE I HAD, I GUESS YOU CAN SAY. IT WASN'T THE FRIENDSHIP THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE D.A. TRIED TO MAKE IT SOUND OUT TO BE. IT WASN'T THAT TYPE OF FRIENDSHIP AT ALL. YEAH. YOU KNOW, THIS IDEA THAT YOU HAD CONTROL OVER HIM, THAT YOU COULD INFLUENCE SOMEBODY TO COMMIT MURDER, I MEAN, TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT IDEA. IT'S A CRAZY IDEA. CRAZY IDEA. D'ANNA EVEN TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT TO 'EM, TOO. WE HAD TROUBLE FINDING HIM TO DO THINGS AROUND THE MOTEL. WE HAD TROUBLE... HE WOULD DISAPPEAR FOR LIKE 2 DAYS AT A TIME AND HE'D COME BACK. SO I MEAN, WHERE IS THERE CONTROL? THE IDEA THAT JUSTIN IS JUST SO HAPLESS AND USELESS, THAT'S VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY POSITIVE FOR JUSTIN, RIGHT? THAT'S VERY SELF-SERVING, FOR HIM, TO DO THAT, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I BELIEVE THAT. MOST OF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST GLOSSIP WAS CIRCUMSTANTIAL, INCLUDING WHAT WOULD BECOME CENTRAL TO THIS CASE: THE MONEY GLOSSIP HAD IN HIS POSSESSION WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED. IT WAS JUST UNDER $2,000, ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT THAT POLICE RECOVERED FROM SNEED. BUT WHILE SNEED'S MONEY WAS COVERED IN BLOOD, GLOSSIP'S MONEY WAS CLEAN, WITHOUT A DROP OF INCRIMINATING BLOOD OR DNA. ALL OF THE STUFF THAT THEY SAY CORROBORATES JUSTIN SNEED'S TESTIMONY ABOUT RICHARD MASTERMINDING THIS OPERATION IS REALLY WEAK. AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE DISTURBING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOWED TO BE CONVICTED ON THE WORD OF AN ACCOMPLICE, ALONE. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT CORROBORATES WHAT THAT PERSON SAID THAT IS MORE THAN A MERE, TENUOUS CONNECTION TO THE FACT THAT A CRIME ACTUALLY HAPPENED. AND YET, SNEED'S ORIGINAL STATEMENT TO BEMO AND COOK, ESPECIALLY HIS DESCRIPTION ABOUT HOW THE CRIME WENT DOWN, DOESN'T SEEM TO SUPPORT THEIR THEORY OF MURDER-FOR-HIRE. I MEAN, HE ENDED UP KILLING BARRY. I DON'T KNOW THAT HE INTENDED TO, BUT HE DID. HE BEAT HIM PRETTY GOOD, SO. JUSTIN SAYS HE JUST MEANT TO KNOCK BARRY OUT. BEMO SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW IF JUSTIN INTENDED TO KILL HIM. SO HOW CAN THIS MURDER HAVE BEEN PLANNED? THAT FITS WITH THE STORY THAT THIS WAS A BURGLARY THAT WAS BOTCHED, AND THEN THE WHOLE MURDER-FOR-HIRE STORY GOES OUT THE WINDOW. AND WHY WEREN'T THE POLICE INTERESTED IN THAT? THOSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE, YOU KNOW? WHY WEREN'T THE POLICE INTERESTED? ** AFTER COUNTLESS HOURS OF INVESTIGATION AND NUMEROUS DEAD ENDS, THE LEGAL TEAM'S HARD WORK SEEMS TO HAVE FINALLY PAID OFF. THEY'VE TRACKED DOWN A POTENTIAL WITNESS, ROGER LEE RAMSEY, WHO WAS IN COUNTY JAIL WITH JUSTIN SNEED. GOOD TO SEE YA. - YOU TOO. - THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US. - YES, SIR. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT PICTURE? YES, I DO. THAT IS JUSTIN SNEED. SO YOU GUYS WERE CELLMATES RIGHT AFTER THIS MURDER. - YES. - AND WHAT WAS YOUR INTERACTION WITH HIM LIKE? WHAT WAS HE LIKE BACK THEN? HE WAS LIKE A MAN COMING OFF OF DRUGS. HOW DO YOU MEAN? HE ACTS JUST LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE DOPE USERS, JUST LIKE I DID. - YEAH. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY SENSE OF THE FACT THAT WHAT HE'D DONE WAS REALLY WRONG. I TAKE IT TO BE THAT HE PROBABLY FELT THAT HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING WHAT HE HAD TO DO 'CAUSE THEIR NUMBER-ONE GOAL WAS MONEY FOR DRUGS. AT WHAT POINT DID HE ACTUALLY START TALKING ABOUT THE CRIME? ACTUALLY, IT WAS PROBABLY WITHIN 2 OR 3 HOURS OF HIM COMING IN. AND WHAT WAS HIS STORY? WHAT DID HE TELL YOU? STORIES THAT HE WOULD TELL ME WOULD CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. THE ONLY THING THAT NEVER DEVIATED FROM THE STORY IS THE FACT THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN HIM INVOLVED. HIM AND WHOEVER ELSE WERE GONNA ROB A GUY THAT OWNED A MOTEL. I DON'T THINK THAT HE WENT THERE WITH THE INTENTIONS OF KILLIN' THAT MAN. BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO RELEASE THE MONEY, SO THEY BEAT HIM TO DEATH. THE VICTIM DID NOT WANT TO RELEASE THE MONEY? HE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE UP HIS MONEY. - SO THEY BEAT HIM. - SO THEY BEAT HIM TO DEATH. IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION WHO THAT, YOU KNOW, WHO THAT SECOND PERSON WAS. DID JUSTIN TELL YOU THAT GLOSSIP -- JUSTIN NEVER MENTIONED GLOSSIP'S NAME TO ME, EVER. SNEED NEVER MENTIONED GLOSSIP'S NAME. NEVER MENTIONED GLOSSIP'S NAME. RIGHT. AND WHAT WAS THE ROLE OF THE OTHER PERSON? THAT WAS, SUPPOSEDLY, A GIRL'S JOB, WAS TO GET HIM LURED OFF INTO THE ROOM. SO WAS THAT...? THAT WAS PART OF THEIR PLAN, ACCORDING TO HIM. LURE THE GUY INTO THE ROOM WITH A GIRL? YES. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, JUSTIN SNEED SAID HE WAS HIRED BY RICHARD GLOSSIP TO KILL THE MOTEL OWNER, BARRY VAN TREESE. DOES THAT SQUARE WITH WHAT HE TOLD YOU? NO, I NEVER HEARD THAT IT WAS A MURDER-FOR-HIRE. I JUST THINK SNEED WAS THERE DOING SOMETHING THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DOING AND GOT CAUGHT UP IN SOMETHING THAT WENT REAL, REAL BAD. ROGER LEE RAMSEY'S STORY PROVIDES DON KNIGHT WITH A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE THEORY TO THE MURDER OF BARRY VAN TREESE. AND, IF THIS THEORY CAN BE CORROBORATED, IT REALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BLOW GLOSSIP'S CASE WIDE OPEN. ** JUSTIN SNEED NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON BEING IN THE ROOM WITH HIM. HE SAID HE KILLED BARRY VAN TREESE BY HIMSELF, AT THE BEHEST OF RICHARD. THERE'S A MUCH MORE PLAUSIBLE STORY: THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER WOMAN IN THAT ROOM AND THAT THIS WAS A BOTCHED ROBBERY. I MEAN, THIS TO ME IS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WAS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE IN THAT ROOM? WHICH THROWS JUSTIN SNEED'S STORY OUT THE WINDOW. SO THAT'S THE SMOKING GUN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE, LIKE A GRAND SLAM AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR. ** IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GONNA HAPPEN? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS NEXT? WHAT I THINK IS NEXT IS, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS -- AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS -- NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THROUGH ALL OF THIS, I HAVE THE RIGHT REPRESENTATION. I HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME AND WHO HAVE FOUGHT VERY HARD FOR ME. BUT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG WITH THIS, I CAN'T COMPLAIN NOW BECAUSE I DID HAVE DON KNIGHT, I HAD ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE, AND THEY'VE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO PROVE MY INNOCENCE TO THE WORLD. IF I HAD TO DIE, I WANTED THE WORLD TO KNOW I WAS INNOCENT, AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT I AM. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S INNOCENT. WHEN YOU'RE DOING INVESTIGATIONS, YOU'RE EITHER GONNA PROVE A GUY INNOCENT OR YOU'RE GONNA PROVE HIM GUILTY. ONCE WE GET OUR INFORMATION DOWN AND ONCE WE FILE THE CHARGE, WELL, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE. AND I TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD SEEN THE LAST FREE AIR THAT HE'LL EVER BREATHE WHEN WE LOCKED HIM UP, AND IT WAS TRUE. IF THAT'S WHAT HE THINKS IS A GOOD INVESTIGATION, I'D SAY WHATEVER MAKES HIM SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT, I GUESS. I MEAN, HE DID THIS. HE DID THIS. HE LEFT ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDONE. I'VE DONE MY JOB. WHETHER HE GETS EXECUTED OR NOT IS ON THEM. ONCE IT GETS TO THAT POINT, THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. I'VE DONE WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. NOW, IF THEY DO IT, THEN THAT'S ON THEM. SO, I SLEEP WELL AT NIGHTS. ** **
