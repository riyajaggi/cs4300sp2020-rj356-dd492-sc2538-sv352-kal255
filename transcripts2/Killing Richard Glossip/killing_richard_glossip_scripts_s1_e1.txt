 Reporter: THE FEEL HERE AT THE OKLAHOMA STATE PENITENTIARY IS A LOT DIFFERENT TODAY. HERE WE ARE, STILL THREE HOURS AHEAD OF THE ANTICIPATED TIME OF EXECUTION FOR INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP. Knight: I WAS WITH RICH FROM 11:00 TO 1:00. AND AT 1:00, WE HAD TO LEAVE AND WE WERE ESCORTED OUT. I KNEW AT THAT POINT IN TIME THAT OUR ONLY HOPE LEFT WAS SOMETHING FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. Man: WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER WAS A LAST-MINUTE PLEA TO SPARE THE LIFE OF RICHARD GLOSSIP.

 THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAD DENIED THAT STAY IN A VOTE OF EIGHT TO ONE. IT WILL GO ON AS SCHEDULED. Man #2: THIS IS MURDER. THIS IS THEM KILLING A -- AN INNOCENT MAN. THEY'RE JUST GONNA KILL HIM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL IN COURT, EVERYONE KNOWS. THE WORLD KNOWS THAT RICHARD GLOSSIP IS INNOCENT. EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF THAT PRISON, WE WERE JUST WAITING. Woman: I THOUGHT FOR SURE RICHARD WAS DEAD. Reporter #2: AND NOW WE ARE GETTING WORD THAT THERE HAS BEEN A STAY OF EXECUTION GRANTED BY GOVERNOR MARY FALLIN.

 YEAH! OH, MY GOSH. IT'S A STAY FOR SOME LETHAL-INJECTION ISSUE. SOMETHING ABOUT OBTAINING ANOTHER DRUG TO DO THE EXECUTION. Campbell: WE PRAISE YOU FOR THIS DAY, GOD. WE PRAISE YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL NEWS. UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED HIM DEAD, I HAD HOPE. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON HIM. - HERE'S TO YOU, RICKY! - LOVE YOU, RICKY! LOVE YOU, BUD. Knight: IT WAS LIKE LAZARUS COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD. ** Berlinger: IN OKLAHOMA, DEATH ROW INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP IS LIVING ON BORROWED TIME. ALREADY, HE'S BEEN ON THE BRINK OF EXECUTION ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. NOW, ONCE AGAIN, THE STATE IS PREPARING TO PUT HIM TO DEATH, ON CHARGES OF HIRING ANOTHER MAN TO COMMIT MURDER. BUT FAR TOO MANY TROUBLING QUESTIONS SWIRL AROUND HIS CASE. I'M NOT IN THIS THING, MAN! I'M REALLY NOT. I'M JOE BERLINGER. AS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, I'VE SPENT MY CAREER SHINING A LIGHT ON STORIES OF INJUSTICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? THEY'RE READY TO KILL THIS GUY. I THINK IT'S A REAL BAD DEAL. AS GLOSSIP'S LAWYERS SEARCH FOR NEW EVIDENCE... EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH HAPPENED RIGHT HERE. ...TIME IS RUNNING OUT. DID THE SYSTEM GET IT WRONG WITH RICHARD GLOSSIP? IT'S AN INNOCENT MAN WHO'S GONNA BE EXECUTED IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW. WE ARE THE LAST, BEST CHANCE THAT RICH HAS, AND WE HAVE TO SUCCEED BECAUSE, IF WE FAIL, HE DIES. Knight: WHY IS OKLAHOMA SO HELL-BENT ON KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP? Berlinger: I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT, BUT I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO BASICALLY HAVE THREE LAST MEALS. IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ALMOST EXECUTED, YOU KNOW, THREE TIMES. WOW. AND THE THIRD TIME IT WAS HAPPENING, DID YOU THINK THIS WAS IT? DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD EVER BE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? 18 YEARS IS A LONG TIME. Woman: YOU HAVE 60 SECONDS REMAINING. Berlinger: EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THE MAJORITY OF DEATH ROW INMATES ARE GUILTY BEYOND DISPUTE. RICHARD GLOSSIP COULD BE THE EXCEPTION. SO BEFORE THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA TRIES AGAIN TO EXECUTE HIM, I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIS CONTROVERSIAL CASE. FROM HIS ARREST AND PROSECUTION, TO HIS TRIALS AND EXPERIENCES ON DEATH ROW IN OKLAHOMA. Farley: THIS IS A GUN-TOTING, HANG 'EM HIGH STATE. PEOPLE BELIEVE EYE FOR AN EYE, TOOTH FOR A TOOTH. I MEAN, PEOPLE WANT REVENGE AND HERE IN OKLAHOMA, THEY GET IT THROUGH THE DEATH PENALTY. THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT RICHARD GLOSSIP IS INNOCENT. I HESITATE ONLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WEREN'T THERE. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE CASE, THAT I COULD NEVER SAY FOR A FACT THAT HE IS GUILTY. Berlinger: GLOSSIP WAS CONVICTED ON A CHARGE OF MURDER FOR HIRE, ORDERING AND PAYING FOR THE MURDER OF HIS BOSS, A MAN NAMED BARRY VAN TREESE, AT THIS RUN-DOWN MOTEL ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT PLACES GLOSSIP AT THE SCENE OF THE MURDER. INSTEAD, GLOSSIP WAS CONVICTED LARGELY ON THE BASIS OF A NOW CONTROVERSIAL CONFESSION FROM THE ACTUAL KILLER, A 19-YEAR-OLD NAMED JUSTIN SNEED. WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT OKLAHOMA, I TALK ABOUT IT AS THE RED DIRT STATE. AND MY IMMERSION INTO OKLAHOMA IS THROUGH RICHARD GLOSSIP. Berlinger: SISTER HELEN PREJEAN IS BEST KNOWN FOR THE BOOK AND MOVIE, "DEAD MAN WALKING," WHICH CHRONICLED HER WORK WITH A GUILTY INMATE ON LOUISIANA'S DEATH ROW. RICHARD GLOSSIP'S CASE IS FAR DIFFERENT. SHE BELIEVES HE'S ACTUALLY INNOCENT. ONCE YOU BECOME AWAKE AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG, THEN YOU'VE GOT TO WORK TO HELP PEOPLE SEE, "WAIT A MINUTE. WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS. WE DON'T HAVE TO KILL OUR OWN CITIZENS. WHY ARE WE DOING IT?" MY WHOLE THING, ONCE I STEP IN THAT DOOR, IS TO BE THERE FOR RICHARD AND TO BE ATTENTIVE TO HIM. TRY TO RECEIVE AND READ WHERE HE IS, HOW HE IS. IT HAS TO BE THE MOST UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE THING IN THE WORLD, TO KNOW YOU'RE INNOCENT. Knight: IT'S RICH? RICH? - Hello? HEY, RICH. HOW ARE YOU DOING? Knight: WHEN I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS CASE, SISTER HELEN HAD SAID, "DON, I NEED YOU TO DO THIS AND I NEED YOU TO GIVE THIS MANY HOURS OF YOUR TIME." YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD SAY NO, BUT ANYBODY WHO'S MET HELEN PREJEAN KNOWS THAT YOU JUST CAN'T SAY NO. BUT I'M A LAWYER. I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, AND, YOU KNOW, IS RICH REALLY INNOCENT? Berlinger: DON KNIGHT IS LEADING RICHARD GLOSSIP'S POST-CONVICTION LEGAL TEAM IN A RACE AGAINST TIME. KNIGHT, A FORMER JUDGE, HAS SPENT THE MAJORITY OF HIS CAREER AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY. FOR THE LAST 17 YEARS, HE'S FOCUSED HIS PRACTICE ON DEATH PENALTY CASES. I MEAN, I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR A WHILE ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T BE THINKING THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT OF PRISON NEXT MONTH OR SOMETHING, RIGHT? I MEAN, WE WANT YOU OUT, OF COURSE. WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET YOU OUT, BUT IT'S A SITUATION THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE TIME. Berlinger: WHAT IS HIS LEGAL STATUS NOW? RICH HAS BEEN THROUGH ALL OF HIS APPEALS, ALL OF THE APPEALS OF THE APPEALS. IN OCTOBER OF 2014 WAS HIS CLEMENCY HEARING. Man: MY VOTE IS NO. THEY DENIED CLEMENCY. AND AT THAT POINT, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT. THERE'S ONLY THE EXECUTION. THE ONLY THING THAT WILL GET RICH BACK INTO COURT NOW IS FOR OUR DEFENSE TEAM TO FIND AND ESTABLISH INNOCENCE, WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLY HIGH BAR TO GET OVER. Berlinger: PROVING ACTUAL INNOCENCE MEANS FINDING SMOKING GUN EVIDENCE AND THEN CONVINCING THE COURTS IN OKLAHOMA, FIRST TO HEAR THAT EVIDENCE AND THEN GRANT GLOSSIP A NEW TRIAL. BUT THIS IS A 20-YEAR-OLD CASE WITH A LOT OF MISSING EVIDENCE, NO DNA AND DOZENS OF DEAD OR MISSING WITNESSES. IF THERE'S A SMOKING GUN, IT'S, WHAT HAPPENED HERE? AND WE CAN TELL THAT STORY. SO, THIS IS THE TIMELINE THAT I PUT TOGETHER, STARTING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THIS IS ALL FROM THE POLICE REPORTS. ON JANUARY 6th, WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT THAT BARRY WAS KILLED? Berlinger: BARRY VAN TREESE WAS 54 YEARS OLD, A FATHER OF SEVEN FROM LAWTON, OKLAHOMA. HE SPENT 20 YEARS IN BANKING BEFORE INVESTING IN THREE RUN-DOWN MOTEL PROPERTIES IN THE STATE. HE NAMED HIS SMALL CHAIN OF MOTELS THE BEST BUDGET INN. Knight: WE KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF DRUG ACTIVITY AND A LOT OF PROSTITUTION GOING ON THERE. IT SHARES A PARKING LOT WITH A STRIP JOINT AND IT STILL DOES TODAY. Berlinger: THE OKLAHOMA CITY BEST BUDGET INN IS BARRY'S FIRST STOP ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 6, 1997. SO IT TOOK HIM A COUPLE HOURS TO DO THE THINGS HE NEEDED TO DO. HE COUNTED THE DEPOSITS AGAINST THE BOOKS AND, APPARENTLY, HE HAS ABOUT $3,000 THAT HE GOT FROM RICH. 35-YEAR-OLD RICHARD GLOSSIP HAD BEEN MANAGING THE BEST BUDGET INN FOR TWO YEARS, OFTEN COLLECTING BONUSES WHEN HE MET OR EXCEEDED MONTHLY REVENUE GOALS. GLOSSIP AND HIS YOUNG GIRLFRIEND, D'ANNA WOOD, LIVED IN AN APARTMENT BEHIND THE MOTEL OFFICE. 8:00 P.M., BARRY LEAVES FOR TULSA. WHEN BARRY LEAVES THE MOTEL IN OKLAHOMA CITY, HE STASHES THE RECEIPT MONEY UNDER THE FRONT SEAT OF HIS CAR. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, BARRY IS UNDER FINANCIAL PRESSURE AND IS HOARDING CASH. HE KEEPS AN ADDITIONAL $23,000 IN THE TRUNK IN MARKED ENVELOPES. BARRY'S NEXT STOP IS TULSA, OKLAHOMA, TO CHECK ON HIS OTHER MOTEL. AND HE TELLS THE TULSA MANAGER THAT IF HIS WIFE CALLS, TELL HER, "I'LL BE HOME IN 51/2 HOURS." - I'LL BE HOME? - YES. BACK TO LAWTON. THAT IS ONLY A 2 HOUR AND 45 MINUTE DRIVE. - RIGHT. - TULSA TO LAWTON. RIGHT. SO, WHY WOULD HE TELL HIM, "IF MY WIFE CALLS, I'LL BE HOME IN 5 AND 1/2 HOURS"? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. BARRY NEVER MADE THAT DRIVE. INSTEAD, HE CAME BACK TO HIS OKLAHOMA CITY MOTEL AND WENT STRAIGHT TO ROOM 102. WHY BARRY VAN TREESE CHANGED HIS PLANS, AND WHO HE MIGHT'VE SEEN WHEN HE ARRIVED IS A MYSTERY. A MYSTERY THAT DON KNIGHT BELIEVES THE POLICE AND PROSECUTORS HAVE YET TO SOLVE. WHY ARE HIS CLOTHES HERE ON THE COUCH IN ROOM 102? NOWHERE IN THE ROOM IS THERE A PICTURE OF A SUITCASE, RIGHT? IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. HE WAS FOUND IN THAT ROOM AND HIS SUITCASE WAS IN THE CAR AND, YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE... IT'S OBVIOUSLY IN GLOSSIP'S OWN INTEREST FOR HIM TO ALLEGE THAT VAN TREESE CONSORTED WITH PROSTITUTES. AND IF THERE WAS A WOMAN IN HIS ROOM ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER, IT GIVES HIS DEFENSE TEAM A NEW THEORY OF THE CRIME. BUT IT ALSO RUNS THE RISK OF DEEPLY OFFENDING THE VICTIM'S FAMILY. WE WANTED TO TALK TO THE VAN TREESE FAMILY, BUT THEY TURNED DOWN OUR REQUESTS FOR AN INTERVIEW. Knight: WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED HERE? THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF PROSTITUTES, A LOT OF TRANSIENTS, DRUG DEALERS. WE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY KNEW BARRY VAN TREESE HAD CASH. SO THERE IS AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE, THEN, TO KILL THIS PERSON. WHAT WAS HE DOING AT THAT MOTEL? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE, BUT I KNOW THERE WAS A BETTER STORY THAN THE PROSECUTION TOLD. ** IT'S VERY STRANGE BEING IN THIS ROOM. I MEAN, IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE IT DID THE MORNING OF JANUARY 7, 1997. BUT IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME ROOM FROM THE CRIME SCENE. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE BARRY VAN TREESE WAS LYING AND KNOWING ALSO HOW MUCH BLOOD WAS ON THE WALLS AND ON THE DOOR. IT'S UNSETTLING, FOR SURE. Berlinger: REPORTER JORDAN SMITH HAS WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT GLOSSIP'S CASE FOR THE INVESTIGATIVE NEWS SITE, "THE INTERCEPT." WE WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH TO THE FACT THAT HE BELONGED ON DEATH ROW. I MEAN, WE KNOW WHAT HE IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DONE, BUT IT'S JUST SCANT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT. Berlinger: THE CASE FILES DEMONSTRATE HOW POLICE COMBINED FINANCIAL RECORDS AND WITNESS TESTIMONY TO ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO PRESENT THEIR THEORY THAT GLOSSIP WAS EMBEZZLING MONEY BY RENTING OUT ROOMS OFF THE BOOKS. Smith: THEORETICALLY, AT LEAST WHAT THE STATE SAYS, THERE WAS MAYBE $6,000 MISSING FROM THE OKLAHOMA CITY OPERATION, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN PROVE THAT. Berlinger: THE STATE ARGUED THAT IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE MURDER, GLOSSIP HAD BECOME AWARE THAT BARRY VAN TREESE WAS GROWING SUSPICIOUS OF THE MISSING MONEY AND WAS READY TO FIRE HIM. SO, ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTION, GLOSSIP CAME UP WITH A PLAN TO MURDER BARRY AND TAKE OVER THE MOTEL. BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THE MURDER HIMSELF, PROSECUTORS CONTEND THAT GLOSSIP CONVINCED HIS 19-YEAR-OLD MAINTENANCE MAN, JUSTIN SNEED, TO DO THE ACTUAL KILLING. JUSTIN SNEED HAD DRIFTED INTO TOWN FROM TEXAS AS PART OF A ROOFING CREW AND EVENTUALLY STAYED AT THE BEST BUDGET INN. NOW, ACCORDING TO PROSECUTORS, SNEED AGREED TO MURDER BARRY VAN TREESE INSIDE ROOM 102 IN EXCHANGE FOR THE MONEY IN VAN TREESE'S CAR. Smith: BUT OF COURSE, WHAT YOU BELIEVE DEPENDS ON WHO YOU BELIEVE. SO, ACCORDING TO JUSTIN, THAT NIGHT, JUSTIN'S IN HIS ROOM 117. HE TAKES THIS BAT, TAKES THE MASTER KEYS THAT HE HAS, GOES DOWN TO BARRY'S ROOM. BARRY WAKES UP. A STRUGGLE ENSUES. THEY KIND OF GET CAUGHT UP IN AND AMONGST EACH OTHER. JUSTIN GOES BACKWARDS WITH THE BAT, SMASHES OUT THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDOW AND THEN HE KIND OF COMES BACK UP. AND THEN JUSTIN JUST SWINGS AWAY. EVERYTHING THAT THEY FIND HERE INDICATES A GREAT STRUGGLE. THAT THERE WAS SOME HELL OF A FIGHT, BASICALLY, AND THAT BARRY PUT UP A HELL OF A FIGHT BUT ULTIMATELY WAS OVERPOWERED. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AWARE THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON IN THIS ROOM. THE MAN STAYING NEXT DOOR, HE HEARS ARGUING, BUT HE CAN'T REALLY MAKE OUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. NOBODY SEEMED INCLINED TO INTERVENE. AFTER THE MURDER, JUSTIN SNEED CIRCLES BACK TO HIS ROOM 117. CLEANS HIMSELF UP. THEN HE RETURNS TO ROOM 102, TAKES THE CAR KEYS, GETS IN BARRY'S CAR, DRIVES IT OVER TO THE WEOKIE CREDIT UNION AND STEALS THE FUNDS THAT WERE LEFT IN THE CAR. NOW, RICHARD HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY. RICHARD HEARS A TAPPING ON THE WALL WHERE THE MANAGER DEPARTMENT WAS. IT'S JUSTIN SNEED AND HE'S GOT A BIG KNOT ON THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD. SNEED SAYS THAT THE GLASS IN ROOM 102 BROKE. THAT THERE WAS SOME DRUNKS FIGHTING. RICHARD SAYS, "IN THE MORNING, WE'LL GET SOME PLEXIGLASS AND PUT IT OUT THERE." AS HE'S LEAVING, HE BASICALLY SAYS, "OH, AND I KILLED BARRY." Berlinger: LATER THAT MORNING, WHILE SNEED IS INSTALLING PLEXIGLASS OVER THE BROKEN WINDOW OF ROOM 102, A NEIGHBOR WHO HEARD THE SCUFFLE SEES GLOSSIP HELPING WITH THE REPAIR. THAT YOU'D COME AND PUT UP THIS PLEXIGLASS WITHOUT LOOKING INSIDE IS STRANGE. BUT THEN AGAIN, BARRY'S CAR WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OUT FRONT OR IN FRONT OF ROOM 102 AT THIS POINT. SO, THEORETICALLY, RICHARD MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT THAT BARRY EVER CAME BACK. Berlinger: THE EVENTS THAT UNFOLDED THAT DAY, WHILE VAN TREESE LAY DEAD ON THE FLOOR, PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN HOW THE POLICE CAME TO FOCUS ON RICHARD GLOSSIP. GLOSSIP LEFT THE MOTEL IN THE AFTERNOON TO BUY D'ANNA WOOD AN ENGAGEMENT RING. IT WAS BAD TIMING ON HIS PART. Knight: SO, IT'S ABOUT 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVERYBODY KNOWS BARRY'S MISSING AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THEY FOUND HIS CAR IN THE WEOKIE CREDIT UNION. THE POLICE ARE STARTING TO ARRIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE FILLING OUT A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT. CLIFF EVERHART ARRIVES. CLIFF EVERHART, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HIM. HE SAYS HE'S A BOUNTY HUNTER, TOO... - HE'S A BOUNTY... - ...AND A SECURITY GUARD. AND PART OWNER OF THE BBI. AT SOME POINT IN TIME, EVERHART SENT SNEED TO GO LOOK THROUGH THE ROOMS. SO THE COPS, FOR SOME REASON, STOP WORRYING ABOUT LOOKING IN THE ROOMS BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. Berlinger: AROUND THIS TIME, MOTEL EMPLOYEES PAGE GLOSSIP AND THEY RETURN TO THE BEST BUDGET TO FIND POLICE OFFICERS ON THE SCENE. AS SOON AS ALL THESE POLICE START COMING AROUND, THAT'S THE LAST TIME THAT JUSTIN IS SEEN. THIS WAS HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY AND IN REAL TIME. - YES. - I MEAN, BARRY IS MISSING. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING. RICH IS BEING ASKED QUESTIONS AND HE'S TRYING TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS, BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHO TO SAY WHAT TO AND HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? FINALLY, AT 10:00 PM, EVERHART AND A POLICE OFFICER BREAK INTO ROOM 102 AND DISCOVER BARRY'S BODY. Smith: THE COPS FIND BLOOD EVERYWHERE, ALL OVER THE WALLS, ALL OVER THE DOOR, THE BROKEN WINDOW, BARRY'S BODY ON THE FLOOR. HE'S JUST BLOODY AND BEATEN. THERE IS AREAS ON THE WALL WHERE THEY THINK THAT BARRY'S HEAD KIND OF CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE WALLS BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE SORT OF THE STRIATIONS FROM HIS HAIR. Berlinger: HOMICIDE DETECTIVES ARRIVE ON THE SCENE AND, ACCORDING TO POLICE RECORDS, CLIFF EVERHART STEERS THE INVESTIGATORS TOWARDS GLOSSIP. EVERHART TELLS DETECTIVES THAT GLOSSIP GAVE HIM WILDLY INCONSISTENT ACCOUNTS ABOUT WHEN HE HAD LAST SEEN BARRY VAN TREESE ALIVE. Smith: THEIR STANCE FROM THE BEGINNING IS REALLY AGGRESSIVE AND THEY JUST DID NOT SEEM OPEN TO ANY OTHER SCENARIO. THAT'S NOT EXACTLY HOW YOU KIND OF WANT TO START OFF AN INTERROGATION. Knight: IN THE 24 OR 48 HOURS AFTER THIS HOMICIDE, BEMO AND COOK WERE LIKE A LASER BEAM ON RICH. AND HE WAS IN A SITUATION THAT WAS JUST OVERWHELMING FOR HIM. OKAY. MM-HMM. Knight: BEMO'S ALWAYS CIRCLING AROUND, LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF WEAKNESS, SOME KIND OF WAY TO BORE IN. I'M LISTENING. Farley: BEMO AND COOK WERE HARD-CORE HOMICIDE DETECTIVES. WHATEVER IT TOOK TO MAKE AN ARREST, THEY WOULD DO. THEY WERE NOT FRIENDLY PEOPLE TO REPORTERS. THE PRESS DIDN'T LIKE THEM AND THEY WERE INSISTING THAT HE CONFESSED TO THE WHOLE THING AND HE NEVER DID. TO THIS DAY, HE'S INSISTED THAT HE'S INNOCENT. Knight: THIS CRIME TOOK PLACE ON JANUARY 7th OF 1997. SNEED RAN OFF THAT DAY AT ABOUT 3:00. ENDED UP GOING BACK TO THE ROOFING CREW THAT WAS STILL IN TOWN THAT HE HAD QUIT BEFORE, AND HE WAS GONE FOR ABOUT A WEEK. AND THEN, HE WAS ARRESTED. Farley: IT WAS A CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE AGAINST GLOSSIP WITH SNEED PROVIDING ALL THE CORROBORATING TESTIMONY. HERE, YOU HAVE A YOUNG KID AND HE TELLS THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. THEY TELL HIM WHAT THEY WANT HIM TO SAY. HE SAYS IT AND CASE CLOSED. Berlinger: THE INTENSE PRESSURE ON JUSTIN SNEED TO SAY WHAT HE THINKS THE POLICE WANT TO HEAR IS SOMETHING JEFFREY DESKOVIC CAN WELL RECOGNIZE. Detective: JUSTIN, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS THING. DESKOVIC SPENT 16 YEARS IN PRISON AFTER CONFESSING TO A MURDER THAT HE DID NOT COMMIT. Deskovic: IT WAS A LONG TIME. I FELT THAT THIS DAY WOULD ACTUALLY NEVER COME. HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU WERE CHARGED WITH YOUR CRIME? YOU WERE 16, RIGHT? - I WAS 16 YEARS OLD, RIGHT. INTERROGATION PLAYED A KEY WITH YOU. YES, IT DID. SO I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF THE INTERROGATION OF JUSTIN SNEED AND HIS DECISION TO NAME A CO-CONSPIRATOR, WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT FELT CONTRIVED OR LEGITIMATE. STOP. SO THEY JUST SUGGESTED A BENEFIT TO HIM, THOUGH, INDIRECTLY, "THE BEST THING FOR YOU WOULD BE TO TELL US WHO ELSE WAS INVOLVED." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, THOUGH? "THE BEST THING FOR YOU." IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT. THERE'S A REWARD IN IT FOR YOU. RIGHT. SO IF YOU NAME SOMEBODY, EVEN IF IT'S FICTITIOUS... - RIGHT. ...YOU'RE GOING TO GET A GOOD DEAL. YES. YEAH, BUT SEE, JUST RIGHT THERE HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW, RICH IS UNDER ARREST." HE JUST NOW INDIRECTLY TOLD HIM IN A RATHER OBVIOUS WAY WHO THEY WANT HIM TO GIVE THEM SPECIFICALLY. THEY'RE RATCHETING IT UP. THEY'RE RATCHETING THE PRESSURE UP. SO HE'S FEELING TRAPPED? YEAH. DEFINITELY. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HE IS GOING THROUGH PSYCHOLOGICALLY NOW? I THINK THAT HE IS LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT AND THERE'S ONLY REALLY ONE WAY OUT. THE COPS HAVE MADE THAT CLEAR TO HIM. YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS, THIS REMINDS ME OF MY BEING INTERROGATED. AND LOOK, YOU GOT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU JUST, JUST TO GET RELIEF FROM THE SITUATION, YOU TOLD THEM WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR, WHICH IS THAT YOU, YOU KNOW, RAPED AND KILLED SOMEBODY THAT YOU DIDN'T. SO IMAGINE BEING IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY GUILTY OF A CRIME, YOU KNOW? AND HOW THAT MUST PLAY WITH, YOU KNOW, A DESIRE TO BE COMPLIANT. I MEAN, I WOULD'VE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IN A LEGITIMATE QUESTIONING. WHAT SNEED WOULD'VE COME UP WITH. WHAT WOULD HE HAVE SAID? WOULD HE EVEN HAVE MENTIONED GLOSSIP'S NAME AT ALL, PERIOD? Boyiddle: THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE BOXES OF LETTERS THAT RICHARD'S RECEIVED. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM? OH, YES. THIS IS JUST ONE BOX OF THEM. HE'S GOT A LOT MORE THAT WE COULDN'T GET RELEASED TO US. - FROM FRANCE. - OH, YEAH. THEY'RE FROM EVERYWHERE. LONDON. AND HOW MANY LETTERS HAS HE GOTTEN? OH, MY GOSH. THOUSANDS! HE'S GOT PILES AND PILES AND PILES OF LETTERS. THIS IS AMAZING. "DEAR RICHARD, I HOPE THIS FINDS YOU IN THE BEST OF HEALTH AND SPIRITS. MY FRIEND AND I ARE ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNING FOR YOU. I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE GOVERNOR." THEY ALL BELIEVE HE'S INNOCENT. WOW. DO YOU THINK ALL THESE LETTERS HAVE ANY IMPACT? THEY DID ON RICHARD. I KNOW THAT. THEY HELPED HIM STAY STRONG. - YEAH. AND HE TRIED TO ANSWER EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE. HE WAS ONE OF A LOT OF KIDS, RIGHT? YEAH, HE WAS ONE OF 16. SEVEN BROTHERS AND EIGHT SISTERS. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? - IT WAS CHAOTIC. I MEAN, I HAD AUNTS AND UNCLES MY AGE, YOU KNOW? AND WE ALL GREW UP TOGETHER. SO HE WASN'T THAT MUCH OLDER THAN ME, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS JUST VERY UPBEAT. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY. WHAT IMPACT DID THE ARREST HAVE ON HIS OWN FAMILY? I KNOW IT HAD A PRETTY BIG IMPACT ON HIS MOM AND DAD. HE'S LOST BOTH OF HIS PARENTS SINCE HE'S BEEN IN PRISON. HIS MOM ATTENDED THE FIRST AND SECOND TRIAL. SHE BELIEVED TILL THE DAY SHE DIED THAT HE WAS INNOCENT. SO DID HIS FATHER. TWO OF HIS CHILDREN DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM ANYMORE BECAUSE HE HAS THAT MURDER ATTACHED TO HIS NAME. Prejean: WE TALKED ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERYBODY TODAY. AND THEN I TOLD HIM AGAIN WHO HE IS TO ME. AND I SAID, "RICHARD, I SEE THE GOODNESS IN YOU." I'M A NUN BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW PRAYER HELPS PEOPLE. ALL I KNOW IS WHEN YOU COME INTO THE PLACES OF MYSTERY LIKE THIS, YOU PRAY TO ASK THAT HE WILL HAVE WHAT HE NEEDS TO GET THROUGH THIS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS CONVERGENCE OF FORCES AROUND RICHARD IS GONNA SAVE HIS LIFE. I'M HOPEFUL THAT HE IS GONNA LIVE. Berlinger: EVERY DAY THAT PASSES BY WITHOUT NEW EVIDENCE IS ANOTHER DAY CLOSER TO RICHARD GLOSSIP'S EXECUTION. IT COULD COME AS EARLY AS THE SUMMER OF 2017. WHILE HIS LAWYERS WORK TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE, GLOSSIP TRIES TO STAY POSITIVE. Sarandon: YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE GOING TO CHECK OFF BOXES OF WHAT COULD GO WRONG AND WHERE THE INJUSTICE IS, YOU WOULD BE CHECKING A LOT OF BOXES FOR HIM. Berlinger: ACTOR AND ACTIVIST, SUSAN SARANDON, IS ONE OF RICHARD GLOSSIP'S MOST ARDENT SUPPORTERS. HE'S MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE ALL ALONG. HE HAD NO MOTIVE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. IT ALL HINGED ON THE DEAL THAT THE MURDERER MADE TO GET LIFE AND TO GIVE THIS PROSECUTOR ANOTHER LITTLE MARK IN HIS BELT BECAUSE HE PRIDES HIMSELF ON BEING SOMEONE WHO HAS SENT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THEIR DEATH. AND ONE OF THE FEW WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT IS SOMEONE WHO'S PAID SOMEONE TO MURDER SOMEONE, AND SO THAT WAS THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM. YEP. PLEASE. Campbell: RICKY WANTED TO EARN EVERYTHING HE GOT AND HE HAS EARNED EVERYTHING HE'S GOT, UNTIL THIS, YOU KNOW? AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE ONE GUY GOT PINCHED. RICKY JUST HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM PEOPLE WHO WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME, FROM THE WAY I SEE IT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT HIS BACKGROUND, HIS HISTORY, NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME. HE NEVER EVEN HAD A PARKING TICKET. HE'S WORKED HARD ALL OF HIS LIFE. WHY WOULD HE DO THIS? Berlinger: PROSECUTORS COBBLE TOGETHER THE FINANCIAL RECORDS OF THE BEST BUDGET INN, CONSTRUCTING A THEORY THAT SNEED AND GLOSSIP DIVIDED ABOUT $4,000-- MONEY THAT SNEED STOLE FROM UNDERNEATH THE FRONT SEAT OF BARRY'S CAR. Wright: WHY WOULD HE HAVE SNEED KILL HIM FOR $2,000? IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. - NO. THIS IS RICH'S $1,757 THAT HE HAD ON HIM. THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO CAST THIS AS MONEY THAT WAS TAKEN FROM BARRY AND SPLIT WITH JUSTIN. - RIGHT. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THIS IS MONEY THAT, WELL, RICH HAD A PAYCHECK AND OTHER MONEY THAT THE POLICE AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID $4,000 IN CASH WAS TAKEN FROM BARRY. - MM-HMM. IN ADDITION, SNEED'S MONEY HAS BLOOD ON IT. OH, THESE ARE UP-CLOSE PICTURES. - RIGHT. - OH, WOW. DID THEY EVER DO ANY TESTING AS FAR AS BLOOD TESTING TO SEE WHOSE BLOOD IT WAS? YES. IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS SNEED'S BLOOD AND WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL DNA REPORT THAT EXCLUDES RICH AND THEN CONFIRMS THAT ALL OF THE BLOOD IS SNEED'S AND NOT BARRY'S. SO SNEED CUT UP HIS HANDS PRETTY GOOD AND WHEN HE'S HANDLING THE MONEY, BLEEDING ALL OVER IT. OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT ALL OF THAT BLOOD. IT WAS EVERYWHERE. AND THEN RICHARD'S MONEY HAS NO DNA EVIDENCE ON IT. IT HAS NO BLOOD ON IT AND THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. WHY WASN'T THIS EVER QUESTIONED? WHY WASN'T THIS EVER FOLLOWED UP ON? WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COMPILE A NICE LITTLE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND IN THESE BOXES' NAMES. - YES. - AND SURPRISINGLY, OR MAYBE NOT SURPRISINGLY, MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WERE NEVER CONTACTED. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO GET MORE WITNESSES WHO CAN, HOPEFULLY, GET THE OKLAHOMA COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS TO COME OVER TO OUR SIDE. IT WOULD HELP. IT WOULD HELP SAVE A LIFE. Berlinger: SO WE'RE HEADING TO SEE RICHARD GLOSSIP IN PRISON ON DEATH ROW. IT'S TAKEN US A LONG TIME TO GET THIS INTERVIEW. HE HASN'T BEEN INTERVIEWED IN-PERSON PROBABLY IN TWO YEARS. IT'S TAKEN QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO GET AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO FINALLY MEETING HIM. TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF OVER HERE. JACKET. ** REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'M GLAD WE FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK FACE-TO-FACE. IT'S TAKEN QUITE A BIT TO GET THIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU. SO WE APPRECIATE IT. SO LET'S JUST START OFF. HOW DID YOU LAND HERE? I LANDED HERE BECAUSE, IN MY OPINION, I WAS JUST IN A BAD PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME AND SOMEBODY BROUGHT ME INTO THIS TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIFE. JUSTIN'S FIRST STATEMENT THAT HE MADE TO POLICE NEVER INCLUDED ME IN ANY OF IT. JUSTIN SAID THAT IT WAS A ROBBERY GONE BAD FROM DAY ONE. THERE WAS NO INTENT OF MURDER FROM JUSTIN SNEED OR ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS THING. - YEP. ME, PERSONALLY, I COULDN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING I PUT SOMEBODY ELSE BEHIND BARS FOR SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T DO, AND THAT THEY WOULD COME THIS CLOSE TO DYING THREE TIMES. AND THE WHOLE THING COMES DOWN TO THE WORD OF SNEED VERSUS YOUR WORD. JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU HAD NO PLANS TO ENCOURAGE JUSTIN TO ROB BARRY. NO. THERE WAS NO MURDER FOR HIRE PLOT? NO. YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED TO BARRY WAS WRONG. IT WAS A BRUTAL THING AND HE DIDN'T DESERVE IT. THAT'S FOR SURE. BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, THOUGH. WHAT DO YOU THINK BARRY VAN TREESE WOULD SAY ABOUT ALL OF THIS? YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IF HE COULD LOOK DOWN NOW... I THINK IF HE COULD LOOK DOWN AND MAKE IT KNOWN, HE WOULD TELL THEM ALL THEY'VE GOT IT WRONG. YEAH. WITH ALL OF THIS OUT THERE, THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA STILL IN THIS RAMPED-UP STAGE TO KILL ME. YEAH. AND, I MEAN, WE GET BACK TO WHAT I BELIEVE IT IS, IS THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT HOW WRONG THEY WERE IN THIS THING, HOW MANY YEARS THEY'VE TAKEN FROM SOMEBODY. THEY DESTROYED MY LIFE. THEY TOOK ME FROM MY FAMILY. THEY TOOK ME FROM EVERYTHING THAT MATTERED TO ME IN LIFE. PEOPLE SAY, "WHY AREN'T YOU MORE ANGRY?" I'M NOT ANGRY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE. I WANT TO BE -- I DON'T WANT TO BE MISERABLE. LIFE IS SHORT AS IT IS AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE THAT PERSON, BUT I DO GET DAYS WHEN I SIT THERE AND I THINK TO MYSELF, "HOW?" I MEAN, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. NOBODY COULD EVER BELIEVE THIS STORY. KILLING AN INNOCENT PERSON? YOU CAN'T GET THAT BACK. YOU CAN'T GIVE THAT PERSON BACK TO THEIR FAMILY. YOU CAN'T MAKE UP TO THEIR FAMILY WHAT YOU DID TO THEM. Ackley: I JUST WANT THE RECORD TO REFLECT THAT I'M HERE UNDER AN AGREEMENT THAT I WON'T BE PHOTOGRAPHED OR HAVE MOTION PICTURES OF ANY KIND TAKEN OF ME, AND I'M MAKING MY OWN RECORDING OF OUR CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW, GLOSSIP TOOK THE POSITION FROM DAY ONE, "I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING." SO HE PUT THE STATE TO ITS BURDEN AND WE MET THAT BURDEN, AND LET ME TELL YOU, IF THE JURY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT TESTIMONY THAT CAME DIRECT TO THEIR EARS FROM JUSTIN SNEED, THERE'S NO WAY THEY WOULD'VE CONVICTED RICHARD GLOSSIP. I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS A REGRETTABLE NECESSITY OF LIFE. AND WE ALL HAVE TO BE ON GUARD ALWAYS TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE LAWFULLY AND CAREFULLY. I WON'T STOP PROVING HE'S INNOCENT. NONE OF US WILL. WE'LL STILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THE WORLD KNOWS REGARDLESS WHAT THEY DO. GOD BLESS THE LESS FORTUNATE IN THIS WORLD. GOD, LORD, BLESS... Priest: WHEN THE SHEPHERD SEES THAT HE HAS LOST THE SHEEP, WHAT DOES HE DO? HE LEAVES THE 99 IN THE DESERT AND HE GOES... Prejean: FORGIVENESS IS BETTER THAN VENGEANCE. WE SHOULD LOVE EACH OTHER AND HAVE COMPASSION AND MERCY FOR EACH OTHER. TO CHOOSE LIFE. CHOOSE LIFE FOR THE INNOCENT, YES. RICHARD HAS GIVEN ME A FEELING OF, "COME ON. COME ON. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING AND WE'RE GOING TO DIG INTO IT TOGETHER." I SAID TO RICHARD, "THERE'S A LOT IN THIS THING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO ACTUALLY BE INNOCENT." LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE COMING TO BAT FOR YOU. ALWAYS CONTINUE, LORD, TO WATCH OVER RICKY AND HIS CASE, FATHER. PLEASE, LORD, WE KNOW YOU KNOW THAT HE IS INNOCENT AND WE KNOW THAT HE IS INNOCENT. LET THE WORLD SEE THAT HE IS ALSO, FATHER LORD. I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A SUPER, SUPER HUMAN EFFORT TO SAVE HIS LIFE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO TRY. Sneed: THAT NIGHT, I WAS ASLEEP WHEN MR. GLOSSIP CAME TO MY BEDROOM. I CAN'T FIGURE OUT EXACTLY AT WHAT POINT I DECIDED TO JUST GRAB THE BAT AND GO OVER THERE. I JUST REMEMBER GOING OVER THERE AND OPENING THE DOOR. THERE ARE STILL SO MANY QUESTIONS IN THIS CASE. WHY ARE WE BELIEVING JUSTIN SNEED?
