 ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. NOW, ONCE AGAIN, THE STATE IS PREPARING TO PUT HIM TO DEATH ON CHARGES OF HIRING ANOTHER MAN TO COMMIT MURDER. BUT FAR TOO MANY TROUBLING QUESTIONS SWIRL AROUND HIS CASE. I'M NOT IN THIS THING, MAN! I'M REALLY NOT! I'M JOE BERLINGER. AS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, I'VE SPENT MY CAREER SHINING A LIGHT ON STORIES OF INJUSTICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? THEY'RE READY TO KILL THIS GUY. I THINK IT'S A REAL BAD DEAL. AS GLOSSIP'S LAWYERS SEARCH FOR NEW EVIDENCE... EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH HAPPENED RIGHT HERE. TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

 DID THE SYSTEM GET IT WRONG WITH RICHARD GLOSSIP? THIS INNOCENT MAN IS GOING TO BE EXECUTED IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW. WE ARE THE LAST BEST CHANCE THAT RICH HAS, AND WE HAVE TO SUCCEED BECAUSE, IF WE FAIL, HE DIES. WHY IS OKLAHOMA SO HELL-BENT ON KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP? ** I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT OKLAHOMA CITY HAS REALLY GROWN. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THE '90s. YOU KNOW, YOU HAD THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. SEEMED LIKE EVERYONE WAS MOVING AWAY FROM OKLAHOMA CITY. WE'RE GETTING AWAY FROM THE MORE PATROLLED AREA, AND YOU'RE GETTING KIND OF OUT INTO THE OUTSKIRTS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MORE DRUG TRAFFICKING, MORE SHADY KIND OF SETTINGS LIKE THAT. YOU'LL NOTICE THERE'S A LOT OF TRUCK STOPS AND LESSER-PRICED MOTELS. WHAT BRINGS ME BACK TO OKLAHOMA? RICHARD GLOSSIP. MY LIFE CHANGED AT THE BEST BUDGET INN. MY NAME IS WAYNE FOURNERAT. I WAS RICHARD GLOSSIP'S FIRST TRIAL LAWYER, CASE NUMBER CF 97-244. HELLO. WILL ROOM 102 BE AVAILABLE? YES. YES, SIR, 102 IS AVAILABLE. OKAY. I NOTICED THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS. YOU KNOW, THERE USED TO BE SINCLAIR GAS STATION RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IT'S BEEN ALMOST 20 YEARS SINCE WAYNE FOURNERAT DEFENDED RICHARD GLOSSIP. GLOSSIP WAS ACCUSED OF ORCHESTRATING THE MURDER OF HIS BOSS, THE OWNER OF THE BEST BUDGET INN, BARRY VAN TREESE. GLOSSIP WAS FACING THE DEATH PENALTY. I FIRST MET RICHARD IN THE OLD OKLAHOMA COUNTY JAIL. HE WAS VERY POLITE; HE WAS VERY SCARED. HE WAS VERY "WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING ON?" HE HAD A LIFE WITH HIS FIANCEE, AND THAT WAS HIS LIFE. AND SO, IT WAS A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO CALM SOMEONE AND SHOW COMPASSION TO THEM AND SAY, "JUST LET ME FIND OUT," YOU KNOW. I WAS BEING TOLD THAT RICHARD GLOSSIP HAD ALLEGEDLY ASKED JUSTIN SNEED, OR TOLD JUSTIN SNEED, TO KILL BARRY VAN TREESE -- DID IT HAPPEN? NO, NOTHING THAT I SAW INDICATED IT AT ALL. BUT THE STATE CLAIMED THAT GLOSSIP WAS RESPONSIBLE AND BASED THEIR CASE ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE MAN WHO BRUTALLY MURDERED BARRY VAN TREESE WITH A BASEBALL BAT -- JUSTIN SNEED. MANY BELIEVE THE STORY THAT SNEED TOLD THE POLICE WAS COERCED. IN ORDER TO AVOID THE DEATH PENALTY, SNEED TOOK A PLEA OF LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE ON THE CONDITION THAT HE TESTIFY AGAINST GLOSSIP. YOU KNOW WHAT JUSTIN SNEED'S PLEA AGREEMENT SAYS? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT SAYS, THAT HE'LL TELL THE TRUTH. JUSTIN SNEED IS AFRAID, IF HE RETRACTS HIS STATEMENT, THEY'LL GIVE HIM THE DEATH PENALTY. GLOSSIP WAS ALSO OFFERED A PLEA, BUT HE TURNED IT DOWN, MAINTAINING HIS INNOCENCE. NOW, TWO DECADES LATER, HE SITS ON DEATH ROW AND FACES A LOOMING EXECUTION DATE. THE KEY EVIDENCE IN THE CASE WAS JUSTIN SNEED. HE'S THE ONE THAT SAID, "RICH ORDERED ME. RICH PAID ME." SO THE FIRST THING I DID WAS DIG INTO JUSTIN SNEED. DON KNIGHT, GLOSSIP'S CURRENT LAWYER, IS ATTEMPTING TO UNCOVER ANY SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT COULD SAVE GLOSSIP'S LIFE. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT JUSTIN SNEED. YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT HE WAS BORN IN TEXAS. AND, UM, YOU KNOW, RIGHT AROUND THE EIGHTH GRADE IS WHEN HE QUIT SCHOOL. HE'S GOT THIS DRUG HISTORY. HE HAD BEEN IN JUVENILE DETENTION. HE HAD BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW FOR FRAUDULENT CHECK-WRITING. I FOUND THIS DOCUMENT, APPLICATION FOR DETERMINATION OF COMPETENCY. A LAWYER NAMED GEORGE MISKOVSKY WAS APPARENTLY REPRESENTING JUSTIN SNEED IN APRIL OF 1997. AND MISKOVSKY SAYS IN THIS APPLICATION THAT MR. SNEED IS CURRENTLY INCOMPETENT TO UNDERGO FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN THE ABOVE-STYLED ACTION. HIS LAWYER IS SAYING HE CANNOT MEANINGFULLY COMMUNICATE WITH HIS CLIENT. IN JULY, WE HAVE THE COMPETENCY EVALUATION THAT WAS DONE BY DR. EDITH KING, AND HE SAYS HE'S CURRENTLY TAKING LITHIUM AT THE JAIL. IT'S A POWERFUL DRUG, PROBABLY HELPING HIM CONTROL HIS MOODS. "IT MAY WELL BE THAT MR. SNEED," THIS IS DR. KING'S WORDS, "HAS HAD AN ATYPICAL MOOD SWING DISORDER IN HIS PAST CHARACTERIZED BY UPS AND DOWNS, INCLUDING ANGER OUTBURST." HE JUST DOESN'T LOOK ALL TOGETHER THERE. THIS IS THE GUY THAT IS REALLY THE BASIS OF THE PROSECUTION'S CASE. DESPITE THESE REPORTS, A JUDGE ALLOWED SNEED TO TESTIFY IN GLOSSIP'S TRIAL, AND THE JURY WAS NEVER TOLD OF SNEED'S PSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY. NEARLY 20 YEARS LATER, ADVOCATES FOR GLOSSIP MAINTAIN THAT SNEED STILL DEMONSTRATES SIGNS OF MENTAL INSTABILITY. HOW YOU HOLDING UP SINCE THE LAST TIME WE TALKED? YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU GET THROUGH THIS LONG SENTENCE OF YOURS, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW... I'VE STRUGGLED WITH MY OWN JOURNEY IN THIS LIFE AND MY OWN REASONS OF WHY I AM WHERE I AM FOR THE REASONS THAT I AM AND THE CHOICES THAT I MAKE. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH ME BEING ABLE TO INTERPRET THE CHAPTER 12 OF REVELATIONS WITH, UM, THE SYMBOLISM OF A DRAGON AND EVIL, AND THEN JUST THE WAY MY MIND OPENED UP TO THAT ON FOUR BLOOD MOONS WHILE EVERYBODY WAS TRYING TO ARGUE WHETHER WE SHOULD KILL THIS MAN OR NOT. UM... AND... HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THIS SITUATION, THOUGH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MORE CLARIFICATION ON THAT. HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU FOUND YOURSELF IN 20 YEARS AGO? UM, THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE IN MY MIND, AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH. AND MAYBE A WHOLE LOT OF THE WORLD DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS JUSTIN SNEED'S WORD THAT FORMED THE BACKBONE OF RICHARD GLOSSIP'S PROSECUTION. OPENING ARGUMENTS BEGAN IN OKLAHOMA CITY ON JUNE 3, 1998. OVERSEEING THE PROSECUTION WAS BOB MACY, A DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE NATION'S DEADLIEST PROSECUTORS. AFTER THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING IN 1995, MACY BECAME ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST OUTSPOKEN ADVOCATES FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. I AM PUTTING TOGETHER THE FINEST DEATH PENALTY PROSECUTION TEAM IN THE COUNTRY, AND WE WILL BE READY, AND WE WILL SEEK THE DEATH PENALTY, AND WE WILL GET THE DEATH PENALTY. MACY HAD BEEN IN POWER AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS KNOWN FOR TACTICS TO MAKE AN ARREST SO THAT MACY COULD GET A CONVICTION. HE HAD A LOT OF POWER IN THIS COUNTY. HE COULD SWAY A JURY IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS BETTER THAN ANYBODY I'VE EVER SEEN. HE WAS NOTORIOUS FOR CARRYING HIS FIREARM INTO THE COURTROOM, YOU KNOW, INVOKING THE BIBLE IN ARGUMENTS, SECURING 54 DEATH SENTENCES ON HIS OWN. I WAS GOING TO GO TO TRIAL AGAINST THE MACHINE, THE MOST DIFFICULT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN OKLAHOMA COUNTY, AND HE DESERVED THAT REPUTATION. ** AND A LOT OF US ARE FAMILY ON THIS ROAD. LIKE, MY COUSIN LIVES -- HER DAUGHTER LIVES RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. BUT IT'S NICE OUT HERE. I LOVE MY BROTHER. I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH. AND HE'S INNOCENT. HE WAS ALWAYS THE QUIET ONE. HE WANTED TO OWN HIS OWN PIZZA PLACE. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED, BUT IT JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR HIM. HE NEVER ASKED ANYBODY FOR ANYTHING. RICHARD NEVER EVEN SO MUCH AS GOT A TICKET THAT I KNOW OF. I'VE NEVER HAD A DOUBT. HE WAS NOT INVOLVED. THERE'S JUST NO WAY HE WAS INVOLVED. I WOULD PORTRAY RICHARD GLOSSIP AS A MAN WHO WAS NAIVE ABOUT THE LEGAL SYSTEM. RICHARD GLOSSIP BELIEVED, IF HE WAS JUST HONEST, HE'D BE LET GO, THAT HE WOULDN'T BE IN IT. HE DIDN'T DO IT. BY ITS OWN ADMISSION, THE PROSECUTION HAD LITTLE FORENSIC EVIDENCE TYING GLOSSIP TO THE ACTUAL KILLING. THEY WERE LEFT TO ARGUE A CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE, ONE BUILT AROUND THEIR STAR WITNESS, JUSTIN SNEED. WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO SEE JUSTIN ON THE STAND? HE KEPT HIS HEAD DOWN THE WHOLE TIME. HE WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK UP. HIS HEAD STAYED DOWN LOOKING FORWARD THE WHOLE TIME. IT WAS HARD. I WANTED TO JUST GO BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HIM, BUT THEN WHERE WOULD I BE? THE PROSECUTION PAINTED SNEED AS THIS SORT OF HELPLESS DUPE, KIND OF FOUND HIS WAY TO THE BEST BUDGET INN. AND THEN HE MET THIS POWERFUL MAN IN RICHARD GLOSSIP. AND THIS POWERFUL MAN COULD TELL HIM WHAT TO DO AND TELL HIM WHEN HE HAD TO EAT AND TELL HIM WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY KIND OF A FANCIFUL STORY. THE PROSECUTION DEPICTED GLOSSIP AS A CRIMINAL MASTERMIND WHO WANTED TO TAKE OVER THE MOTEL. THEY ALSO CLAIMED GLOSSIP WAS EMBEZZLING MONEY FROM BARRY VAN TREESE. TO ME, THIS IS A COMPLETELY LUDICROUS MOTIVE AND STORY. RICHARD WAS HERE A LOT BY HIMSELF WITH LOTS OF CASH BECAUSE THIS IS A CASH-ONLY OPERATION. SO IF HE WAS REALLY DESPERATE FOR $2,000 OR SOMETHING, THE SORT OF FAR MORE LOGICAL THING TO DO WOULD JUST BE TAKE THE CASH AND RUN. THEN THIS WHOLE IDEA OF THIS VIOLENT MURDER OF YOUR BOSS, THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. I KNEW HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE FROM DAY 1 WHEN WE WAS IN THAT COURTROOM. HE DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE. WAYNE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, SO HE WASN'T STANDING UP AND SAYING ANYTHING. AND I'M THINKING, "THIS GUY'S GOING TO GET MY BROTHER KILLED." I MEAN... YOU'D NEVER DONE A CAPITAL MURDER. THAT'S CORRECT. THAT WAS MY FIRST AND MY ONLY, AND WILL ONLY BE MY ONLY. THERE WASN'T ANY REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE A CERTAIN SPECIALIZATION. I DON'T KNOW HOW PREPARED WAYNE FOURNERAT WAS FOR THE TRIAL. LOOKING AT THE TRANSCRIPTS, IT WOULD SEEM NOT VERY. IT'S A DISASTER FROM THE START, THAT TRIAL. WAYNE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT THEORIES OF THE CRIME. NONE OF THEM MAKE ANY SENSE, AND THEN SOME DON'T EVEN INVOLVE JUSTIN SNEED, THAT THERE'S, LIKE, ALTERNATE KILLERS OUT THERE. IT'S JUST... IT'S... THE OTHER THING THAT HE DOESN'T DO, WHICH IS, TO ME, JUST THE MOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE THING IS THE INTERROGATION TAPES. THEY DO NOT GET THE JUSTIN SNEED INTERROGATION INTO EVIDENCE. IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE. PUT THAT TAPE IN THERE AND WATCH HIM LEAD JUSTIN SNEED DOWN THE LITTLE TRAIL IMPLICATING RICHARD GLOSSIP. I THINK THAT JURORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT. THE JURY NEVER SAW THE TAPED INTERROGATION AND NEVER LEARNED THE METHOD THE POLICE USED IN OBTAINING SNEED'S CONFESSION. IT'S A MISTAKE THAT ADVOCATES FOR GLOSSIP BELIEVE SEALED HIS FATE. I'M SO GLAD TO SEE ALL OF YOU. I ASKED IF WE COULD COME TOGETHER. I'LL BRING YOU UP ON THE RICHARD GLOSSIP STORY AND WHERE WE ARE. THE LAWYERS ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN. WE'RE ALL DOING WHAT WE CAN. YOU JUST START WITH THE VERSIONS OF THE STORY THAT SNEED'S TOLD AND YOU... WELL, DETECTIVE BEMO IS SAYING... YOU CAN'T EXECUTE SOMEBODY ON THIS BASIS. "I KNOW THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE INVOLVED." THAT IS HIS MODUS OPERANDI. HIM AND DETECTIVE COOK, THEY'RE BOTH RETIRED NOW, BUT THAT WAS THEIR MODUS OPERANDI. TO GET THE CONFESSION. AND YOU GET THAT IN THERE... AND YOU THREATEN HIM WITH DEATH. THEY'VE USED THAT IN CASE AFTER CASE AFTER CASE. AND, IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THAT, WHICH A DEFENSE LAWYER MUST DO, HE'S GOT TO WORK HARD. AND THAT WAS NOT DONE IN THIS CASE FOR GLOSSIP. THE HARD WORK WAS NOT DONE. A DEFENSE LAWYER WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT FRAME BY FRAME AND THEN MADE A QUESTION OUT OF EVERY FRAME IN THAT FILM. I THINK THAT, SHOWN PROPERLY IN FRONT OF A JURY, WOULD HAVE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. COURT TRANSCRIPTS SHOW THAT, JUST 2 DAYS INTO THE 6-DAY TRIAL, WAYNE FOURNERAT WAS READY TO GIVE UP, REQUESTING WHAT IS CALLED A BLIND PLEA, MEANING GLOSSIP WOULD PLEAD GUILTY AND THEN BLINDLY ALLOW THE JUDGE TO DECIDE THE EXACT SENTENCE. HE STARTED TRYING TO MAKE DEALS. AND I'M GOING, "NO, THIS IS NOT RIGHT." AND I EVEN GOT PULLED INTO CHAMBERS THREE DIFFERENT TIMES. AND THE JUDGE KEPT ASKING ME, "WAS YOU EXPECTING THIS?" AND I SAID, "NO." I SAID, "THIS IS NOT THE DEFENSE WE CLAIMED WE WERE GOING TO PUT ON." ON JUNE 10, 1998, 1 WEEK AFTER TESTIMONY BEGAN, THE JURY FOUND RICHARD GLOSSIP GUILTY OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. THE NEXT DAY, AFTER DELIBERATING FOR JUST 75 MINUTES, THE JURY SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH. WHEN THEY SENTENCED HIM, I WALKED OUT. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY COME BACK WITH THE DEATH PENALTY. I WAS JUST SHOCKED, I REALLY WAS, AND THAT JUSTIN SNEED GOT LIFE IN PRISON. I'M LIKE, "YOU'RE KIDDING." IT WAS WRONG. MY MOM WAS DEVASTATED. SHE WAS DEVASTATED. MY DAD WAS DEVASTATED. HE SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO STICK AROUND HERE AND WATCH MY KID DIE FOR SOMETHING HE DIDN'T DO." I HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED A GREAT DEAL FOR REPRESENTING RICHARD GLOSSIP. I SUCKED AT IT, YOU KNOW. I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT. I TRIED THE BEST JOB THAT I COULD! IF RICHARD HAD HAD A GOOD LAWYER, HE COULD HAVE MADE MINCEMEAT IN THAT CASE. BUT HE WAS POOR. HE WAS IN A SITUATION WHERE CRIMES HAPPENED. HE WAS IN THE GEOGRAPHY OF DEATH. HE WAS IN BOB MACY'S COUNTY. AND THAT CONVERGENCE OF ALL THOSE THINGS CAME ON HIM WHERE HE GOT CAUGHT IN THE MACHINERY OF DEATH RIGHT IN OKLAHOMA COUNTY, AND HE GOT CHEWED UP IN IT. ** MY LIFE WAS GREAT. MY LIFE WAS WONDERFUL. I HAD MY FAMILY HERE, MY WIFE AND HER CHILDREN, AND I LOST ALL THAT. YOU KNOW, I... I... I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING... I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING STUPID BECAUSE OF IT. YOU KNOW, I -- I... I... TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE. IT WAS CLEAR THAT MR. GLOSSIP'S CASE NEEDED A DO-OVER FROM THE BEGINNING. MR. FOURNERAT HAD NEVER DONE A HOMICIDE CASE, MUCH LESS A DEATH PENALTY CASE. MY NAME'S G. LYNN BURCH. I WAS RICHARD GLOSSIP'S APPELLATE COUNSEL AFTER HIS CONVICTION FOR THE KILLING OF BARRY VAN TREESE. IN MR. GLOSSIP'S CASE, THERE WAS SO MANY THINGS OF CONCERN. IT JUST WASN'T EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN A CAPITAL CASE. IN THE YEAR 2000, LYNN BURCH FILED AN APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RICHARD GLOSSIP, CLAIMING THAT WAYNE FOURNERAT HAD BEEN AN INEFFECTIVE COUNSEL. A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE APPELLATE COURT CAME BACK WITH ITS DECISION. YEAH. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME AN APPELLATE COURT IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA UNANIMOUSLY OVERTURNED A MURDER CONVICTION WITHOUT HEARING AN ORAL ARGUMENT. RICHARD GLOSSIP WAS HEADING BACK TO COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL. THE APPELLATE COURTS, THEY ARE NOT A BODY THAT REVERSES CAPITAL CASES ON A REGULAR BASIS, SO IT WAS PRETTY... IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING TO SEE. SO WHERE WE HEADED, DON? WE'RE GOING TO GO SEE MARCIA DAWSON THIS MORNING. SHE HAS SOME GOOD INFORMATION ON A COUPLE OF WITNESSES THAT ARE NO LONGER AROUND. I MEAN, INTERVIEWING ALL OF THE WITNESSES BEFORE THEY DIE WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE, AFTER THAT FIRST TRIAL, AND AS YOU WELL KNOW, THERE WERE VERY FEW WITNESSES WHO WERE ACTUALLY INTERVIEWED, RIGHT? WHICH IS REALLY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED. BEFORE THE TRIAL. YEAH, RIGHT. HI, MARCIA! ASHLEY, YOU WANT TO COME ON IN? SURE. MARCIA DAWSON WAS AN INVESTIGATOR ASSIGNED TO HELP LYNN BURCH PREPARE FOR GLOSSIP'S SECOND TRIAL. MARCIA, THANKS SO MUCH FOR SITTING DOWN AND TALKING TO US TODAY. YOU'RE WELCOME. DO YOU REMEMBER BEING ASKED TO GO AND TALK TO CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THIS CASE? ANYBODY WHOSE NAME POPPED UP IN PAPERWORK PRIOR TO WHERE I GOT THE CASE I COULD GO AND INVESTIGATE. SO YOU ACTUALLY GOT TO SEE ROOM 102 ITSELF. THE ROOM, YEAH. HAD A BIG PICTURE WINDOW. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE BATHROOM AND STUFF WAS AT THE BACK. AND THAT'S SORT OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE EVEN TODAY. YEAH, YEAH. YEAH. SO ONE OF THE PLAYERS, IT SAYS HERE, IS CLIFF EVERHART. RIGHT AFTER YOU WENT AHEAD INTO THE BEST BUDGET INN, CLIFF EVERHART DROPPED IN SEVERAL TIMES, AND HE ASKED IF ANYONE HAD BEEN SNOOPING AROUND ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MURDER. RIGHT. CLIFF EVERHART, A FORMER SHERIFF, GAVE DAMAGING TESTIMONY TO THE POLICE AND AT THE FIRST TRIAL. WITNESSES CLAIM THAT EVERHART WAS INVOLVED IN DRUGS AND PROSTITUTION AT THE BEST BUDGET INN AND HAD BEEN SEEN MEETING WITH SNEED THE WEEK BEFORE THE MURDER. WHEN MARCIA DAWSON CAME TO THE HOTEL TO INVESTIGATE, EVERHART TRIED TO INTERVENE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, CLIFF EVERHART SHOWS UP AND SAYS, "IS ANYBODY SNOOPING AROUND?" WHY WOULD THEY CARE IF SOMEONE WAS SNOOPING AROUND? A MURDER HAPPENED. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SNOOP. IT FEELS LIKE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF PRESSURE... SUBTERFUGE. PRESSURE OR SOMETHING BEING PUT ON. I REALLY WANTED TO TALK TO CLIFF EVERHART. HE WAS MILLING AROUND AFTER THE FACT, YOU KNOW, AFTER VAN TREESE HAD BEEN KILLED, BUT I NEVER GOT TO TALK TO THE MAN. THERE WAS SOMETHING, A SECRET THERE THAT SOMEBODY DIDN'T WANT EXPOSED. AT THE SAME TIME DAWSON WAS GETTING SHUT DOWN, HER BOSS, LYNN BURCH, WAS INTERVIEWING WITNESSES OF HIS OWN, INCLUDING JUSTIN SNEED. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO VISIT MR. SNEED. WE JUST SAT DOWN AT A TABLE AND HAD A CONVERSATION. I WAS ASKING HIM ABOUT THE FACILITIES AND WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT. AND I JUST RECALL HIM MAKING THE REMARK THAT, "IT AIN'T BAD. THEY MAKE BISCUITS HERE THAT'LL MELT IN YOUR MOUTH." HE DIDN'T REALLY PROVIDE US ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION. IN 2003, NEARLY 7 YEARS AFTER VAN TREESE'S MURDER, GLOSSIP WAS GIVEN A SECOND TRIAL DATE. BUT THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN, LYNN BURCH WAS SUMMONED TO COURT TO MEET WITH THE JUDGE AND THE ASSISTANT D.A. THE ASSISTANT DA ACCUSED BURCH OF THREATENING JUSTIN SNEED AND SUGGESTED BURCH WOULD BE FORCED TO ANSWER TO THIS IN FRONT OF A JURY. AFTER I STAVED OFF AN ANEURYSM BY TRYING TO CALM DOWN, I, OF COURSE, SAID, "THAT'S INCREDIBLY LUDICROUS." I REMARKED THAT -- TO THE JUDGE -- THAT THIS WAS A PLOY. THIS WAS A MECHANISM BEING KNOWINGLY EMPLOYED BY THEM TO MAKE ME HAVE TO RECUSE FROM THE CASE. THAT WAS, OF COURSE, DENIED. AND I WENT FROM BEING INVOLVED IN RICHARD'S CASE EVERY DAY, FOR SOMETIMES ALL DAY LONG, TO IT WASN'T MY CASE ANYMORE. THIS SHAKE-UP WAS A HUGE SETBACK FOR GLOSSIP. HE WAS ASSIGNED TWO NEW ATTORNEYS, WHO WERE GIVEN JUST 6 MONTHS TO PREPARE A DEFENSE. THE MACHINERY OF DEATH IN OKLAHOMA COUNTY, IT'S A FOE THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GO TO WAR AGAINST. RICHARD'S DEATH PENALTY'S BEEN HANGING OVER ME FOR A LONG TIME. I'M HOPEFUL THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SEE WHAT A TRAGEDY IT WILL BE IF IT COMES TO THE END THAT THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA'S PURSUING. HOPEFULLY, THAT WON'T HAPPEN. THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT A TRIAL IS LIKE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. IT'S WHAT COMES AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE... ALL OF THE MOTIONS AND ALL OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT YOU GO INTO. THIS CASE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW THINGS GO WRONG FROM START TO FINISH. AND THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY QUESTIONS. IN LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS PRESENTED, WE KNOW THAT ONE BOX OF EVIDENCE WAS DESTROYED. DO WE HAVE A REPORT THAT IT WAS DESTROYED? YES. SO, THIS WAS ON 10/28/99. OKAY. THIS DETECTIVE WAS ASSIGNED TO TRANSFER PROPERTY FROM THE OKLAHOMA COUNTY D.A.'s OFFICE BACK TO THE OCPD PROPERTY ROOM. RICHARD GLOSSIP'S LEGAL TEAM HAS JUST FOUND AN EXPLOSIVE, NEWLY RELEASED REPORT WRITTEN BY THE OKLAHOMA POLICE DEPARTMENT IN 1999. IT STATES THAT THE POLICE DESTROYED A BOX OF EVIDENCE FROM GLOSSIP'S CASE. THE CASE NUMBER IS LISTED, "WITH THE DEFENDANTS LISTED AS GLOSSIP AND SNEED, CHARGED WITH MURDER 1." THE POLICE REASONED THAT THE CASE WAS CLOSED, WHICH WAS PATENTLY FALSE. IN 1999, GLOSSIP WAS STILL 2 YEARS AWAY FROM HIS APPEAL, WHICH WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A SECOND TRIAL. USUALLY, THEY PRESERVE THAT EVIDENCE FOR A VERY LONG TIME, SOMETIMES EVEN AFTER THE EXECUTION AND BEYOND. IT'S JUST NOT THE WAY IT'S DONE. YEAH. SO... PROPERTY IS LISTED AS "ONE ROLL OF DUCT TAPE, ONE BAG WITH DUCT TAPE, ONE BAG WALLET, KNIVES, KEYS, ONE BIG WITH WHITE SHOWER CURTAIN, ONE DEPOSIT BOOK, TWO RECEIPT BOOKS." SO MANY THINGS CAME UP MISSING. IT WAS PAPERWORK THAT WE COULD USE TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANY SHORTAGES AT THAT MOTEL. ALL THESE THINGS SHOULD ADD UP IN PEOPLE'S HEADS, "WAIT. WHY WOULD THEY DO ALL THESE THINGS? WHY WOULD THEY DESTROY ALL THIS EVIDENCE?" PARTICULARLY IN A CAPITAL CASE WHERE THERE'S NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, AND IT'S REALLY HE SAID/HE SAID, YOU KNOW. EXACTLY! TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE HAS A HISTORY IN OKLAHOMA COUNTY. AND IN 2001, THERE WAS A PUBLIC BACKLASH WHEN THE FBI INVESTIGATED BOB MACY AND HIS FORENSIC EXAMINER, JOYCE GILCHRIST. JOYCE GILCHRIST BECAME A FORMIDABLE PRESENCE IN THE LOCAL COURTROOMS. KNOWN FOR HER ABILITY TO GET CONVICTIONS AND SWAY JURIES, HER NICKNAME BECAME BLACK MAGIC. HER TESTIMONY ON HAIR, SEMEN, BLOOD OR EVEN FABRIC HELPED LOCAL PROSECUTORS SEND 23 PEOPLE TO DEATH ROW AND CONVICT THOUSANDS OF OTHERS, BUT HER SCIENCE IS NOW SUSPECT. THE FBI FOUND THAT GILCHRIST HAD TAMPERED WITH AND FALSIFIED EVIDENCE IN NUMEROUS CASES. THE SCANDAL ENDED HER CAREER AND THE REIGN OF LONGTIME D.A. BOB MACY. NEITHER OF THEM WERE PROSECUTED, BUT IN THE YEARS SINCE, A NUMBER OF DEATH PENALTY CONVICTIONS THE TWO WORKED ON HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED. THE FBI LOOKED AT EIGHT CASES AND FOUND THAT, IN AT LEAST SIX OF THEM, GILCHRIST GAVE TESTIMONY BEYOND THE ACCEPTABLE LIMITS OF FORENSIC SCIENCE. BUT FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT GILCHRIST WAS ALSO IN CHARGE OF RICHARD GLOSSIP'S EVIDENCE, AND IT WAS UNDER HER AND MACY'S WATCH THAT THE BOX WAS DESTROYED. ONCE A PERSON GETS A CONVICTION IN A DEATH PENALTY CASE, THAT EVIDENCE IS THE ONLY THING THAT THEY CAN REFER TO. AND THEN IT JUST DISAPPEARS. THAT STINKS. THAT REALLY SMELLS BAD. BY THE TIME RICHARD GLOSSIP'S SECOND TRIAL BEGAN IN 2004, THE BOX OF EVIDENCE HAD LONG BEEN DESTROYED, AND THE JURY WAS NEVER THE WISER. OVERSEEING THE PROSECUTION WERE TWO ASSISTANT D.A.s, CONNIE SMOTHERMON AND GARY ACKLEY. ACKLEY DOES NOT WANT TO APPEAR ON CAMERA BUT HAS AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN AUDIO INTERVIEW. FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY THAT THIS CASE CLEARLY MERITS THE DEATH PENALTY. BUT THE WEAKNESS IN THIS CASE TO THIS DATE IS RICHARD GLOSSIP NEVER LAID A HAND ON BARRY VAN TREESE. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HE CAUSED TO HAPPEN OR HIS INNOCENCE. MY NAME IS ZACHARY WADE VOBORNIK. I WAS A JUROR ON THE SECOND RICHARD GLOSSIP TRIAL SO, ONE OF 12. WE WERE INSTRUCTED BY THE COURT, "HE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE SWUNG THE BAT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER." THE MAN WHO SWUNG THE BAT, JUSTIN SNEED, EXCHANGED HIS TESTIMONY FOR A SENTENCE OF LIFE IN PRISON. AND THE STATE WAS ATTEMPTING TO CORROBORATE SNEED'S STORY IN ORDER TO CONVICT GLOSSIP OF MURDER FOR HIRE. BUT TURNING A POTENTIAL MURDER-FOR-HIRE CONVICTION INTO A DEATH SENTENCE WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN CRITERIA. UNDER OKLAHOMA LAW, ONE OF THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CAN CAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY TO BE RENDERED IS THE DEATH WAS HEINOUS, ATROCIOUS OR CRUEL. INSTANTANEOUS DEATH IS, BY LAW, NOT HEINOUS, ATROCIOUS OR CRUEL. TO BE HEINOUS, ATROCIOUS OR CRUEL, A DEATH MUST BE PRECEDED BY SUFFERING. TO UNDERSCORE THE HEINOUS CRIME THEORY, THE PROSECUTION BROUGHT IN A MEDICAL EXAMINER NAMED DR. CHAI CHOI, WHO CLAIMED THAT VAN TREESE DIED A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH. WHAT WE WERE TOLD WAS BARRY VAN TREESE LAID ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS BRAIN SWELLING AND DIED OVER A PERIOD OF MANY HOURS. WE SAW PICTURES OF BARRY VAN TREESE'S, YOU KNOW, THE AFTERMATH, AND IT WAS HORRIFIC. WE KNEW SNEED HAD BEEN THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE ACT OF MURDERING BARRY VAN TREESE. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING FOR US TO... CAN WE FIND SOMEONE GUILTY OF MURDER IF HE'S NOT THE ONE WHO SWUNG THE BAT? YOU GO AND SIT IN A JURY BOX, AND YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANYONE. THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PRESENTING TO YOU, AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING A TELEVISION SHOW. AND YOU'RE WATCHING, TRYING TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ON WHAT'S REAL AND WHAT'S NOT REAL, WHO'S LYING AND WHO'S TELLING THE TRUTH. THE ANTICIPATION TO HEAR JUSTIN SNEED'S TESTIMONY WAS VERY HIGH. WE WERE ALL INTERESTED TO SEE, YOU KNOW, WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. JUSTIN SNEED'S STORY EVOLVES EVERY SINGLE TIME HE TELLS IT, FROM THIS FIRST INTERROGATION WHERE YOU HAVE THIS, LIKE, SORT OF VERY BASIC, NO FRILLS, HERE'S THE STORYLINE, "HERE'S WHAT RICHARD TOLD ME TO DO." THEN WE ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL IN AT THE FIRST TRIAL. BY THE SECOND TRIAL, WE'VE GOT EVEN ADDITIONAL STUFF GOING ON. THEY ARE JUST EMBELLISHMENTS OVER TIME THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN TRULY VETTED. OVER THE YEARS, SNEED HAS GIVEN THREE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF HOW GLOSSIP APPROACHED HIM ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. FIRST, HE TESTIFIED THAT GLOSSIP CALLED HIM ON A TELEPHONE TO TELL HIM VAN TREESE HAD RETURNED TO THE MOTEL. THEN, HE CLAIMED GLOSSIP BANGED ON HIS DOOR. AND IN OUR RECENT INTERVIEW, SNEED CHANGES HIS STORY YET AGAIN. I DON'T EVEN REALLY REMEMBER HIM KNOCKING. BUT, OF COURSE, HE HAD MASTER KEYS, SO ALL I DO IS REMEMBER WAKING UP TO HIM BEING, YOU KNOW, IN MY FACE. EVEN THE DETAILS OF THE MURDER ITSELF HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. DURING THE FIRST TRIAL, SNEED ADMITS TO KILLING VAN TREESE WITH A BASEBALL BAT. IN THE SECOND TRIAL, HE ADDS THAT HE STABBED HIM WITH A KNIFE. HE HAD CONCOCTED THIS FURTHER STORY WHERE HE AND RICHARD AND BARRY WERE IN A BOILER ROOM AT THE BEST BUDGET, AND IT WAS THEN THAT RICH WANTED HIM TO KILL BARRY AND SAID, "HERE, JUST TAKE A HAMMER AND JUST DO IT. JUST DO IT RIGHT NOW." I MEAN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT WAY LATER. I MEAN, NONE OF THOSE THINGS DID JUSTIN EVER SAY TO THE POLICE. NEVER. HE NEVER SAID THAT TO ANY OF THE POLICE WHEN THEY INTERROGATED HIM. GLOSSIP'S LAWYERS FAILED TO BREAK DOWN THESE INCONSISTENCIES FOR THE JURY. THEY DIDN'T BRING FORWARD THE FIRST TRIAL TESTIMONY OR PRESENT THE JURY WITH SNEED'S INTERROGATION TAPE. IN FACT, THE DEFENSE DIDN'T CALL A SINGLE EXPERT TO REFUTE ANY OF THE STATE'S CASE. THE DEFENSE DID NOT PUT THIS EVIDENCE ON, SO HERE YOU HAVE A SORT OF LACKLUSTER CROSS-EXAMINATION THAT ALLOWS SNEED TO COME OFF AS CREDIBLE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE BALL BOUNCES YOUR WAY, AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. AND THE CASE JUST WENT BEAUTIFULLY FOR THE STATE, AND IT WAS THE RIGHT KIND OF EVIDENCE FOR THAT JURY. AND THEY WHOLEHEARTEDLY ACCEPTED THE STATE'S THEORY OF THE CASE. AFTER JUST 1 HOUR OF DELIBERATION, THE JURY FOUND RICHARD GLOSSIP GUILTY OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. JUST 4 HOURS LATER, THEY SENTENCED HIM TO DIE BY LETHAL INJECTION. AFTER THE SENTENCING, RICHARD GLOSSIP WAS RETURNED TO DEATH ROW. AND SNEED WENT BACK TO HIS MEDIUM-SECURITY FACILITY TO SERVE OUT HIS LIFE SENTENCE. DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE IN HERE? LIKE, DO YOU THINK THERE'S A REASON YOU'RE HERE? AND DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD STAY HERE? UM... DO I THINK THAT I SHOULD SPEND THE REST OF A NATURAL-BORN LIFE OFF IN THE PENITENTIARY? NO, BECAUSE WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT BEING HONEST IS THE ONLY WAY THAT ANYBODY CAN HELP THEM OUT OF ANY TYPE OF PUNISHMENT OR WHATEVER. SO I WONDER WHAT EXAMPLE IT SETS TO YOUNGER PEOPLE EVEN BEING TRUTHFUL BECAUSE THEN IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NO REWARD FOR EVEN BEING TRUTHFUL. JUSTIN, THIS IS MY PARTNER, DETECTIVE BEMO. HOW YOU BEEN? GOOD. HOW YOU DOING? ALL RIGHT. EVER SINCE THE POLICE INVESTIGATION, I DECIDED TO TRUST THEM WITH THE TRUTH BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO KEEP THEIR WORD, AND THEY WERE GOING TO ALLOW ME TO GO HOME. I MEAN, I PRETTY MUCH KNEW THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF PUNISHMENT OR WHATEVER, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IN MY LIFE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE LOCKED INSIDE A PENITENTIARY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. ACROSS THE STATE, GLOSSIP SPENDS 23 HOURS A DAY ALONE IN A WINDOWLESS CELL. EACH HOUR BRINGS HIM CLOSING TO HIS IMPENDING EXECUTION. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO TAKE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE? I MEAN, IT MUST BE AGONIZING. IT'S REALLY HARD. YOU GOT SOMEONE'S LIFE ON THE LINE... RIGHT, AND IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE IS SOMEBODY'S LIFE ON THE LINE. THE WORST PART IS THIS CASE WAS A REALLY, REALLY GOOD, TRIABLE CASE. AND THIS ONE, IN PARTICULAR, IS SO HARD BECAUSE HE'S EXHAUSTED ALL OF HIS APPEALS, ALL OF HIS LEGAL MECHANISMS, CLEMENCY, EVERYTHING. WE ARE THE LAST BEST CHANCE THAT RICH HAS, AND WE HAVE TO SUCCEED BECAUSE, IF WE FAIL, HE DIES. AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN. THIS IS CRAP! THIS IS A BULL **** P.R. CAMPAIGN. THAT'S ALL IT IS. IF IT WAS A BULL **** PR CAMPAIGN, I GUESS I WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT AN AFFIDAVIT WITH ME. WE ARE DEALING FROM A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE IS LOOKING TO DO THIS. THEY WANT THIS MAN DEAD, SO WE'RE FACING LONG ODDS.
