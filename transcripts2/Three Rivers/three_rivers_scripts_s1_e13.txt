 I don't see nothin Sarge. Two suspected insurgents were spotted here 20 minutes ago. They took off when they saw the drone overhead. What do you think it is they were doing? Catching up on old times. Planting an IED I guess. Yeah. Where do you guess it is? That dirt over there, it's dark like it was just turned over. Sarge, wouldn't this be a good time to be wearing bomb suits? Only if it goes off.

 Holy moly. Got an artillery shell, definitely a bomb. Talk to me, Crockett. Dazzle me with your wisdom and insight. Uh, the bad guys could've buried the wires and strung 'em down a ways. But if they took off when they saw the drone, they probably didn't have enough time, so either the bomb isn't armed or the detonator's in here with it. Got something here, Sarge. This is Alpha two. we got a hot one-- cell-phone activated.

 Keep your head on a swivel. What's your plan? I need to gator clip a bypass from the red to white wire. That detonator's rigged to a mercury switch, so try not to move it. Parker, what's your 20? Standing by at the vehicle. Any activity? Negative. Belay my last. Affirmative. Girl on a moped. She sees us. She's slowing down. How's it going with that bypass? I'm having a tough time stripping the wire without moving anything. She's got a phone! She's got a cell phone! Tell her to drop it right now! Don't look at me! Bridge that wire! Put down the phone or I'll shoot! Damn it! Keep going! Do the bypass! Do it now! Congratulations! Everyone within 50 meters is dead. I'm sorry, it got crazy. I got distracted. Distracted?! What do you think it's going to be like out there in the field? There's going to be more chaos than you ever imagined. You need to stay focused at all times! I know. No, you don't! Your brothers are depending on you. You bring that level of game, they all end up in body bags, you got that? You get that through your thick skull? Sarge, you okay? Get out of my sight. I'm fine. Hospital visitor Stuart Scott, please meet your party... Andrew, thank you for doing this. No problem, Luc. Is she your first patient since you took on Dr. Robinson's caseload? Yes. Yes. And I thought it might be helpful if you could introduce me to her. Look at you, trying to see patients as people, instead of test subjects. It's adorable. You been brushing up on your bedside manner, too? I just wish I had a bedside manner to brush up on. Hi, Dorothy. I'm Dr. Yablonski. Yeah, I remember. How are you? My heart's crapping out from the cardiomyopathy, and I'm back here again. You tell me. We're going to sort that out, all right? Now, Dr. Robinson is on leave, so Dr. Bovell here is going to be treating you. He's an excellent physician, so you'll be in great hands, okay? If you say so. I do. So, Ms. Cooper. How are you? He just asked me that. Kuol. If you're trying to achieve inner peace, I'd pick a different room. There's a lot of despair in here. Kuol? Can you hear me, Kuol? Nurse! Nurse! I need a gurney in here now. Yes, doctor. Andy... Kuol. I could hear you, but I couldn't speak. Or move my body. What is happening to me? It's okay, Kuol. It's going to be okay. ♪ Tired of walkin' ♪ ♪ tired of sleep ♪ ♪ the earth is burnin' ♪ ♪ and my tape deck eats the cassingles ♪ ♪ I found in a warehouse... ♪ today, I attempt to jump over not ten, not 12, but 13 cars. This is it. This is my Waterloo. Wait, is that, is that right? My Waterloo? No. Your "waterloo" is your defeat. This is your crucible. "Crucible." That... Would I even say that? Your crucible. Your ultimate test. Why can't I just say "my ultimate test"? 'Cause you said that last time. I'm just trying to mix it up a little here, man. Whatever, let's just shoot. Okay, ready. This is it-- my ultimate test. Crucible... Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! The moment is at hand. This is Roger's partner in crime, Craig Dirkin, bringin' it to you... All the way. To recap for all you Internet fans out there, Roger's last jump was two weeks ago, when he and Melissa tried to clear ten cars. Now that Roger's tailbone is all healed up, he's all set to face his latest challenge-- his crucible-- a jump over 13 cars. Now, some of you may say, "well, Rodge didn't make ten cars, so why's he gonna try 13"" thirteen... Is his lucky number. Anyways, the burning question at hand is: What is going to propel Rodge over 13 cars besides raw courage and a little Humboldt gold? A rocketooster. It'll provide him the extra thrust to propel him to greatness. This one's for you, ma! His battle cry. And so it begins. Roger Banks about to attempt a feat never before attempted. Great start off the line. As he approaches the ramp, he will activate the booster. Whoa! Uh... Houston, we have a minor malfunction. Whoa. Check that out. Uh-oh. ♫ Three Rivers 1x13 ♫ Status 1A Original Air Date on July 3, 2010 -- sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.Com -- Craig Dirkin has gone to meet his final destination. The rocket that felled him lies far away in a field of trash, laughing. Claiming victory over this brave soul-- Craig Dirkin. Oh, wait, hey-- are we getting out now? Okay, let's get him inside. Get him in. Let's get him in. Knoxville General. We meet again. Give me the bullet. 25-year-old male, motorcycle stunt accident. Head, neck, chest trauma, altered mental status, GCS 12. BP 110/60, pulse 120, resps 30, pulse ox 95 on five liters. And multiple lacerations and burns on his neck and shoulder. Was he driving the motorcycle with his face? No, no, he wasn't driving, I was. He's my, uh, videographer, Craig Dirkin. Okay. How'd your friend get these burns? He got hit by a rocket. A rocket? Yeah. The Defiler 3000. Just, like, blew right off my bike. It's actually right here on video, if you want-- you know what? I get the picture. You need to stop filming in here. Dude, no way. Craig would've wanted his last moments on videotape. No one's saying these are his last moments. Doc, you don't have to lie to me, okay? I'm going to do this in his honor as my final tribute. Dude? Dude! It's a miracle. Craig has just risen from death's jaws. What do we got? Male, 52-year-old, collapsed after a military training exercise. Blood pressure: 250/150, pulse 120, resps 20. He was complaining of chest pressure and severe headache. Gave him two nitro sprays and five of morphine, but it didn't touch the BP. Medical records? The army's faxing 'em over. All right, one, two... Three. Sir, what's your name? Do you know your name? Do you know what day it is? No. We need a neurology consult and a priority-one head CT. Hang a nipride drip. Send off a CBC, cardiac panel, let's get an EKG and chest X-ray as well. He's seizing! All right, Ativan, one milligram I.V. push. Thank you all for making this meeting on such short notice. In case you haven't heard, Kuol experienced transient neurological deficit. When? A couple of hours ago. Looks like a small blood clot in his brain caused a ministroke. The CT shows no damage and he seems to have recovered full function. But his blood work shows he's in a hypercoagulable state. Well, that explains the stroke. What's causing this-- infection? We're still running some more tests. Look, I thought the VAD would buy him more time. But now he needs a new heart, and he needs one soon. Bottom line: I want to up his status to 1a. A hypercoagulable state can indicate cancer. Maybe we should make sure he's clear before we change his status. This patient's in a dire situation. The sooner he's listed as status 1a, the better. If he has cancer, we'll deal with it then. That's right. Kuol's out of options. We need to move fast on this. I think the issues are clear. All in favor of making Kuol status 1a? Thank you. Andy? How is he taking this? I haven't told him. Mr. Estes. Hello. I am Dr. Jordan. Call me Sarge. Military. What branch? Army. E.O.D. that stands for... Explosive ordinance disposal. You are looking at the daughter of a gunnery sergeant. Oh, lord, I'm in trouble. Well, not unless you start shooting your mouth off about the Marines. Mmm, so, uh, what's wrong with me? Our tests show your body has stopped making urine. Well, maybe I'm not drinking enough water. Gotta get in the habit anyway. I'm heading back to Afghanistan. I'm not so sure about that. Your high blood pressure has done extensive damage to your kidneys, and your potassium level is high, which is causing a heart arrhythmia. I'm on medication for the blood pressure. I don't know why that's a problem. I don't know, either; But until we can figure it out, we need to put you on dialysis. Dialys-- uh, uh, for how long? However long it takes to turn this thing around. No, no, look, uh, I can't be on dialysis. I got a bunch of kids that are heading into a war zone. I need to finish training them. Well, I'm sure the army can find somebody to fill in while you recuperate. Well, you're wrong. I'm responsible for these boys' lives, and they're responsible for the lives of our troops. Okay, sergeant, you need to calm down. My men are deploying in two weeks, and I will be with them. You understand, doctor? Huh? Do you understand? Craig, dude, tell the fans how you are, man. I'm... Oh, man... You're okay? Right? Like, give 'em a thumbs up or something. My chest... Can't... I can't breathe. Oh, dude. Dude! Pulse ox? Down to 89, pulse up to 125, sinus tachycardia; Resps are 32 and labored. Okay, cyanosis of the lips and the fingertips. Wh-what does that mean? You need to step back, please. Okay, decreased breath sounds on the right with neck distension and a tracheal shift to the left. He's got an acute tension pneumothorax. Get me a 14 gauge. Anesthesia? No. No time. I'm going in at the second intercostal space, midline. Here we go. Three, two, one... Whoa. I don't even feel sick. It's as if nothing happened. I know, but the tests show you have a condition called factor 5 Leiden syndrome. It sounds like something from Star Trek. What it means is, your blood tends to clot too much, it soundsand that's bad, because fromclots can create a blockage. Such a blockage caused my stroke? That's right. We need to control your clotting, and then get you a heart. So, my VAD is no longer working? It's working fine, but the problem is, the VAD is a foreign object in your body, and it can become a locus for clots. And thin your blood. I see from your face, it is not so simple. No, it isn't. There are risks involved with using blood thinners. They can create bleeding in your brain, which is where you had the mini-stroke, so we need to introduce them slowly. In the meantime, I could have another stroke. One that could kill me. And this could occur at any moment. Yes. How are you doing? My chest stopped hurting. Finally. Morphine will do that for you. Where's Roger? Is he okay? I'm afraid not. When Roger fainted, he hit his head on the gurney and sustained a lethal head injury. L-lethal? You mean, like, it could kill him? It has. He's been declared brain dead. No... no way, man. I've seen Roger fall off a roof and hit cement, okay? He skated into oncoming traffic one time. Got thrown 30 feet in the air. He would have walked away from that, except he broke both legs. He can't... He can't be dead. Not from something this lame. I am sorry. If you need anything, ask. Otherwise, try and get some rest, okay? Hey, doc... ...I'm gonna need that video camera. After much reflection, I have made a vow. I will have no more strokes. I think that's a great call. It's gonna make my job a lot easier. I believe this is yet another challenge we will overcome together. Sounds good. Okay, his clotting numbers aren't moving. Let's increase his Coumadin from five to seven migs. Got it. How bad is it, Andy? We need to get that VAD out and transplant him. But if we don't fix his clotting issue... ...He'll stroke out before a heart ever shows up. Dr. Weiss, please report to Radiology. Dr. Weiss to Radiology. Dr. Yablonski? That's right. Detective Sandefur, Pittsburgh P.D. I'd like a word. Can this wait? I'm kind of in the middle of things right now. Let's talk in here. This is quite a place. You've come a long way since Mt. Washington. You put me in this room so everybody could see I'm in here with a cop. Wow. I'm intimidated. You know why I'm here? Your parents engaged in an act of love, and then, nine months later... This is about your slime-bag Uncle, wise ass. Michael Zelasko. He's the focus of a criminal investigation. We know you had contact with him. Is that against the law now? No. But loan sharking is. So is theft and racketeering. Come on, I don't know anything about that stuff. He gave 130k to a fund for that Sudanese kid. So? So the money's dirty. I can get a court order to seize it, and I will. My patient needs that money for a heart transplant. I don't care. I don't care that you're married to Rena, I don't care that you patched up Phil Lombardi. None of that means jack to me. Do I lock up the money, or are you gonna cooperate with me? I need an answer. You want me to rat out my Uncle? I'm gonna need a little time to think about that. Don't take too long. I'll be back. Are you feeling a little better, Sarge? Well, I'll feel better when I'm not hooked up to a machine. Well, the dialysis seems to be working. But we still don't know why your blood pressure's spiking. Am I going to be able to get back to work? Not until we figure this out. I owe you an apology for the way I acted before. I don't know what came over me. You're under a lot of pressure, and you don't feel good. Honestly, the last six months, this has been happening more and more. I have these sudden bouts of anger. Have you suffered a head trauma in the last year? Concussion? Um... nothing like that. A lot of headaches, though. Hmm. I'm going to order a CT scan. Let's see if you're having neurological issues. What, like a brain tumor? I'm not going to speculate. Let's just see if we find anything. Hey. Hey. How's Kuol? Oh, he's, uh, still the same. Listen, Sophia... Sophia. That's a sure sign you want something. That 150 grand that we have raised for Kuol-- it's being held by our foundation, right? And you're one of the trustees? Oh, I don't like the sound of this. The cops are threatening to seize the money. Seize it?! If they do, he'll be dropped from the transplant list. I know. Did he do something wrong? No, absolutely not. This is because of me. Do I need to know about this? No. It's a long story. Listen, the point is, I need you to protect that money. Transfer it to another account, something. I don't have the authority to do that. The trustees make decisions as a group. Can you talk to them? I'll see what I can do. Hey, hey, wait up. Wait up. Ryan! Ryan! Has a heart... Heart come in for Kuol? Kind of. What do you mean, "kind of," Ryan? Kuol's back-up. Okay. Who's the primary? All the donor information is electronic. I must say, Brian, this is extraordinary. It's Ryan. It's a marvelous heart. I'll take it. Mind if we discuss that first? I'm accepting a heart for Dorothy Cooper. What's there to discuss? I'm gonna go hustle up a procurement team. You know you have the option to pass on this heart and let it go to Kuol, right? Have you ever done that? Yes, I have. When there's been a patient in greater need. Dorothy is higher on the list. Yeah. Only because she's been on it longer. You know Kuol's situation. He's in much worse shape. Let's not split hairs here, Andrew-- she's status 1a. She needs a transplant. She can wait. The inotropes are working. She could go for months. She's a difficult match, with antibodies to a broad range of HIA antigens. If I pass now, another compatible heart may not come along. He could throw a clot while we're standing here. You told Dorothy she's in good hands. And she is. This heart belongs to her and she's going to get it. Where's Miranda? She said she's meeting us at the helipad. What is with you and that thing-- are you obsessed? I'm monitoring a couple situations, seeing if a heart comes in for Kuol. We've gotta do something, or he's not going to make it. There's nothing we can do. We have to accept whatever's coming. I-I'm sorry, what is that? Some kind of Zen BS to try to distance yourself from Kuol? You care about him as much as we do. That's right, Ryan, I do. Let's go. These are the doctors who will help Roger achieve his dream of becoming an organ donor. I asked him once, "Roger, why would you tempt fate "by signing up as a donor?" Roger said, "that's just me, man. "I'm all about the karma and the little guy and being awesome"" and he was. Hey, look, I'm sorry, you can't be in here. Oh, no, it's okay, my friend's in there. It's just, I'm just filming a video tribute of him. Yeah, but still, you're not allowed in the O.R. Especially with a camera. I'm sorry. Oh, okay. Uh, well, can I interview you? About what? About Roger. I didn't know him. No, no, it's okay. You can just say anything, you know, you're gonna be, like, the last person to see him, you should say something. All right, um, your friend, Roger, yeah? Uh, he's going to save some lives tonight. Which is a really good thing. Uh, keep going? By him becoming an organ donor makes me think that he was probably a really good guy, okay? Good. And thus... The circle of life is complete. Roger. I don't see any brain tumor. Me, neither, but I do see something here I don't quite understand. What is that, a growth on the eye? Looks like. We need to get a biopsy on that. He's seizing! Again? Roll him on his side. Get me ativan, one milligram, I.V. push. Mr. Estes? Sarge? Sarge, hang in there. I'm right here with you. Two of the trustees are on vacation. I wasn't able to get an answer on Kuol's money. Thanks for trying. After all he's been through, I, uh, I don't think he's gonna make it. It's the first time I've felt this way. How do you deal with it? You need balance, Andy. A life outside of this hospital. Someone to love. Someone to hold you when you cry. Who's that for you? I said you need balance; I didn't say I had it. No one? Not since Dr. Foster? We're veering off course here. I'm-I'm-I'm just surprised, that's all. You know I have my work. That's enough, most of the time. Maybe you should take your own advice. I'm gonna talk to you later. Mrs. Rodriguez to volunteer services. Mrs. Rodriguez to volunteer services please. Excuse me? Oh, man, it's you! How you doin'? I'm fine. How can I help you? Yeah, I came to see the person who got Roger's heart. You know, to like, put them in the film. Hoping to upload to Youtube tomorrow. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think you're going to be able to see her. She's not up for seeing visitors right now, especially people she doesn't know. But I'm Roger's bud-- I'm pretty sure she'll want to meet me. And I understand, but that is a personal decision, and one she may not be up for making right now. Um, can you ask her? Please? I just want to finish the film and, you know, like, get on with my life. All right, wait here. Sweet. I think I know what's going on with your blood pressure. You have a rare genetic disorder called Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome. It causes the growth of small, benign tumors, like the one we found on your right eye during your CT scan. Von Hippel-- what's that got to do with my blood pressure? Well, 20 percent of VHL patients have pheochromocytomas. That's a different kind of tumor that secretes large amounts of adrenalin. It overstimulates the fight or flight instinct, which brings on malignant hypertension. It can also cause angry, sometimes violent outbursts. And I've got one of these... Pheochromocytomas-- Yes, you do, on your adrenal gland. But once we remove it, your blood pressure and your kidney function should return to normal. It's a risky surgery. Manipulating the tumor can cause a surge of adrenaline and a dangerous spike to your blood pressure. We have to pre-medicate you, which means when the tumor's removed, there is the possibility of a crash. It's a balancing act, but we don't have another choice. Well, I've stared down a lot of bombs in my day, doctor. I bet you have, too. So, let's go. Hey. Pam said you wanted to see to me. You remember the vow I made? No more strokes. I don't think I can keep it. Andy, I want you to take this. What is it? A letter to my Omaha family. Some thoughts on how to dispose of what few belongings I have, names and addresses of my relatives in Sudan who should be told. I'll tell you what. Why don't you hang on to this for awhile? It's time. You don't know that. Did I ever tell you about my friend Lam? Yeah. The guy you traveled with to the refugee camp in Ethiopia. We walked for weeks, hiding from soldiers who wished to kill us. Starving. Living on whatever we could. Lam was never quiet when we walked, but this day he was. I asked him why. "I'm going to die," he said. I tried to tell him the many reasons this might not be true. I tried to make jokes. He didn't laugh. And that night, we slept in the jungle. The next morning, I tried to wake him. He was dead. I don't know why. Perhaps he was sick and never told me. But I now understand how he knew. Death is close, Andy. I can feel it... Hovering like a bird. I'm not going to let you die. That's what I told Lam. A heart could still come in. You have done all you can. More than I ever dreamed possible. You are a great friend, Andy. We have had a grand adventure, you and I. I'm not going to give up. And you can't, either. I am at peace. Be at peace with me. Scopes are placed. Locating the tumor. There it is. I'm going to resect. Run of V tach. He's having an adrenalin surge. V fib. Defib at 200. Charged. Everybody off. He's coming back. Hang an amiodarone drip. Still having PVCS. I've got to get this thing out before he arrests. Resecting. Give five migs phentolamine at one MIG per minute. Got it. Tumor is out. BP down to 90 systolic. D/c the nipride. He's cratering now that the tumor's out. Systolic down to 50. Bolus him with saline. Put on the pressure infuser. Start dopamine, we can always titrate his blood pressure back up. Pulse is bradying down. BP down to 36. Damn. Give atropine, point five migs. An amp of epi. Atropine in. Epi in. BP's coming up. Run of seven. Push Lidocaine, 100 migs. Okay, we are back in sinus rhythm. Let's get him off the table. I'll call you if anything changes. You should go home and get some sleep. I can't. For what it's worth, I'm praying for Kuol. Would it make me a hypocrite if I prayed for him, too? We got a code blue. Kuol? Dorothy Cooper! Any hearts in the pipeline? No. What's the situation with Dorothy Cooper? She had a cerebral hemorrhage. Massive brain damage. That heart could have saved Kuol. Maybe. Or maybe he would have had post-op problems, too. There's never any way to know. Ah. I was wondering if I was going to see you today. I thought maybe since you figured out what was wrong, you might have gotten bored. Well, you made me work for it, but the surgery was successful. Your blood pressure is back down to normal, and your kidney function is improving. Everything goes according to plan, you will be discharged from the hospital in a few days and able to get back to active duty. Armed with an excuse for why I've been in such a bad mood all year? Your body was so flooded with chemicals, it put you in panic mode. It overrode your ability to reason. Well, now that I've regained that ability, I've actually been thinking how... 30 years in the military might be catching up with me. In what way? Well, it's hard to have a life outside of the E.O.D. Joke is, it stands for: "Every one's divorced." Never had kids. Thought of my soldiers as-as my kids, but of course, you know, they're not. How about you? You have kids? I have residents and fellows. Staff surgeons. Ah. Sophia. Yes. Would you like to have dinner with me? I am your doctor, sergeant. It's Harold, and... ...It's just dinner. Maybe you could take off the lab coat, and I could put on a suit, and we could see what normal people are like for one night. You are my patient. Not much longer. I'm gonna come back and check on you later. Think about it. Tell UNOS we'll take any heart for Kuol. Luc, I'm sorry about Dorothy. Yeah. First time I treat one of Dr. Robinson's patients, and this is the outcome. Not exactly an inspiring debut. Wasn't your fault. I saw the scan. She had a weak vessel. Well, in any case, uh, maybe something positive might come out of it. Like what? Well, she's brain-dead. It's been confirmed by two other doctors. She's on a ventilator, Andrew. Wait a minute. Was she a registered donor? Indeed, she was. Well, technically, Kuol is still back-up on that heart. And the heart is still good. Call UNOS. Make sure they're okay with this. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Has my doctor come to say good night? I just saw a young man get a new heart. This kid, he... He walked out of a nightmare to get here. Now that he has a life to look forward to, I know he's not going to waste a single minute of it. I would love to have dinner with you. Hmm. I'll call you... As soon as my doctor releases me. Good night, Harold. Good night, Sophia. Just the man I wanted to see. So, you with us on this? I can't help you. Then that money is as good as gone. No. It's already gone. It's spent on the heart I just put in Kuol. You just made the worst mistake of your life. Can you find your own way out, or should I call security? No, you'll be fine. Hi. I brought a visitor for you. Are you Craig, the friend of my donor? Yeah, man. You must be "cool," right? Craig, remember, I told you it's pronounced Ku-ol. Kuol. Yeah. Listen, I'm gonna give you guys some time, okay? How you doing, man? Uh, you look good. I-I don't know what you normally look like, but for a guy who just had a new heart put in him, you look pretty awesome. Yeah, I feel pretty awesome. I wanted to show you this. It's a... Video tribute I made of Roger. Roger always wanted to do something great. I was supposed to be there to catch it on video. He did something great. He saved the lives of six people. One of them, mine. I will never forget him. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, man. Have a good time with Roger's heart. Okay? And-and if you ever want to hang, you know, like... Do you skate? I mean, because we could do a little parkour. There's a sweet construction site by my mom's house. You know, we could just... Tons of things to jump off. I doubt I will be jumping anytime soon. Oh. But I appreciate the invitation. Okay, dude. You're awesome, man. Couple of people want to celebrate your transplant. Hello, my friends. Hi. Got a surprise. Party time. Get ready to make a wish. It's not my birthday. Oh, well, it kind of is. We can't start without Dr. Jordan. She'll fire us all, so, just... I heard that, and I'm here. Okay. To Kuol. To the great Dr. Yablonski. And the team from Three Rivers for giving me life. I thank you all. Yeah. Yes! So, how'd it go with your donor's buddy? Oh, Craig is a lovely young man. But I have a question. Shoot. I've heard stories that recipients sometimes take the traits of their donors. Is there any possibility that I might... Become a stoner idiot? I doubt it. If you ever see me perched atop a tall building with a jet pack strapped to me... I will personally come and pull you from the edge. This heart needs to last you a while, my friend. And so it will. Hey, hand it over. Where's my piece? -- sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.Com --
