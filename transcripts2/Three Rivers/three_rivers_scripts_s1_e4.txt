 Pick up 47. 42! 91! Set! Come on, Come on! slips a second tackle... winds up and throws... and the ball is caught by Antonio Potter! It's a touchdown! Eagles have won the game! It should never even have been that close. You had a 14-point lead, and you blew it, Blair. Three interceptions? Are you kidding me? Look, I don't know where your head was,

 but it sure wasn't out on that field. Sir, did you notice he won the game? This is none of your business, son. - Come on, let's go home - No. I... I'm just gonna ride with the guys. Do me a favor. When you have kids, don't ever talk to them like that. You're assuming I'll actually have sex one day. Gives me hope. Hey, Brandon. How are you feeling, buddy? Like I'm half-man, half-machine. It's weird. I actually feel good. Like I could get back out there and swing a hammer. I thought you guys use nail-guns now. Yeah, well, that doesn't sound as manly. With the ECMO oxygenating your blood, you're getting a boost. But we should talk about the plan, moving forward. Skip the new heart. I'll just stay hooked up to this thing. Your body wouldn't tolerate that. The ECMO is a short-term solution here. So, how much time will it buy me? A few days to a week. So I have to find a new heart between now and then. I think the thing to keep in mind is that one could show up for you today. My dad dropped dead when he was 37. Here I am, 36. Like I'm trying to outrun a bullet with my name on it. We get this transplant, you dodge that bullet. Yeah, but what if a heart doesn't come? I've got Deb and the kids. And I've got another one on the way, man. I can't leave them. Brandon, listen to me. I'm gonna do everything I can, okay? I promise. You have my word. Hey, Dr. Yablonski. Hey. Hey, Deb. Hey, sweetie. How you doing? Hi, babe. I'm good. Real good. I'll come check on you later. April and Crystal made you a get-well card. They do the letters out of macaroni? Linguini this time. Ryan, did you update Brandon Ayers' profile for me? He's already 1A Status, right? Yeah. Since I put him on ECMO, he gets a few bonus points. Trust me, he needs them. Yeah. I gave UNOS the information. Good. Good, good. Now we just have to hope for a match. And I was open, like, five times, man. Yeah. Yeah, you were. So you're saying that because you scored two touchdowns, Chad? That was a great pass, man. What? The pass to Potter. It was awesome. Oh. Thanks, man. Yeah, all that matters. Seriously. Look, look, I look back, right? I see that ball looking, coming at me like a big brown bullet, reach up, grab it. Of course I start running with the speed given me by the Almighty God... ducking, weaving, dodging, whatnot.. It was one touchdown, dude. I ran in the other three. That's what the scouts were looking at. The scouts ain't here for you, Chad? Dude, they came to see me, baby, the Antonio Show. - Yeah? -Yes! Three scouts, three cards. With home phone numbers. Get out of my face, man. Just-just turn around. Aah! What you looking at, Wannabe? - Huh? - Nothing. Nothing? So, you sitting there, listening, getting in my business and stuff? I wasn't doing that. Come on Antonio. Antonio. Like we friends or something, huh? How about I beat your scrawny little ass? What you think about that, huh? It'd be a pretty minor achievement? Oh, okay, so this some kind of joke to you? Huh? I'm gonna mess you up, man, huh? Leave him alone, Antonio. Tsk. Yeah. We not done, Wannabe. Trade with me, man. Antonio? Help. Help me. Oh. Blair! Bobby... you got to help me, man. Don't worry. Everything's going to be all right All right?

This is a Code Green. There has been a mass-casualty event, and we will all be working with ER staff. Dr. Reed just got off the phone with Incident Command. Okay, a bus carrying a football team just blew a tire and crashed on Route 18 near Hillman State Park. Dispatch is sending in extra ambulances from Butler and Lawrence counties. How many victims? At least 30, maybe more. Now, we're the nearest trauma center, so we think a dozen majors will be arriving here in the next 20 minutes. That'll be the first wave. Okay, first one's a minute out. We've got a 17-year-old, head trauma, GCS 12. Vitals stable, sinus brady on monitor. He's Triage Red. See him first. - Let me go with him. - Wait. You were on the bus? Why isn't he on a backboard? He wouldn't cooperate, that's why. I'm fine.. It's Blair you need to worry... We're taking care of Blair. Now we need to take care of you. - Okay? Two more by ground, 30 seconds out. Okay. Hi.. I'm Dr. Foster. Can you tell me your name? Blair. - Blair Hubbell. - Yeah? Any relationto the telescope? - You're funny. - Yeah, and I'm here all week. Okay, can you tell me where you are right now? Uh, Three Rivers? That's where Bobby said they were taking us. Do you know what day it is? It's game day. - That's right. - Okay, you guys. Thanks, bro. Thank you. You save your applause till I've actually done something, okay? You got my legs to quit hurting. Your pain's gone? Yeah. Okay. Can you wiggle your toes for me? Hmm. One more time. Okay, good. Good. Hang tight, okay? Nurse, send him to Radiology. Give me a CT of his spine... cervical to lumbar, and call Neurosurgery. - He may have a spinal cord injury. - Okay? Okay, three more coming. A minute out. The chopper is five minutes out. - The kid on it is critical. - I got him. - Hit me. - Rose Lasky, the bus driver. - She coded in the rig. - How long has she been down? - Nine minutes. - Continue CPR.. Yes, Doctor. Come on, Blair, open your eyes. Come on.a... Squeeze my hand. Blair, squeeze my hand. All right, call Radiology, he needs a Priority One head CT. Dr. Jordan? Do you have a second? Give her four units O-neg on the infuser. Got it. His GCS is down to ten. Should I dose him before he gets sent up to CT? Pupils are unequal but responsive. We could be looking at an intracranial hemorrhage. Yeah, load him up... mannitol and decadron. And call Neurosurgery... tell them to come have a look. Come on, Rose Take a deep breath. Blair said some messed up stuff on the way here. He thought he was in France. He probably got a concussion. Try not to worry, Bobby, he's in good hands. Want to follow this for me? Your parents know you're here? It's just my mom. She's in San Francisco on business. You should probably call her so she doesn't hear about this on the news. Yeah. About how many people were on that bus? Forty-two. You sound pretty sure. It's kind of my thing to keep track. I'm the equip manager. Um, 40 players, Rose the driver and me. That's 42. How did I just walk away? Well, you were just amazingly lucky. I need to know how Blair's doing. - Dr. Jordan, she's not responding.- - Keep going. Pulse is 60. Strong and regular. - When do we get the CT pictures? - Radiology said ten minutes. Call him, tell him we need them now! He's seizing! Ativan, one milligram, IV push. Hang a bag of Cerebyx. Oh, ma'am... only hospital staff are allowed. No, that's my husband, Brandon Ayers. So when there's a donor heart, you're the first to know? Um, more or less. UNOS makes the match, then I get called with the offer. Could I just stay here for a while? I think that if I'm here, that it might just help make something happen. I'm, I'm sorry. If-if it were up to me... I understand. Uh... good luck. Thank God those seizures stopped. Give him Cerebyx over five minutes. I don't want them starting up again. CT's up. He has a subdural hematoma. He needs it drained before his brain herniates. Where the hell is Neurosurgery? They're tied up with a spinal cord injury. We have to do the burr hole ourselves. Where, here in the ER? It can't wait. Get me a drill, craniotomy drapes, please. - Okay, pass off. - Yes, Doctor. Dr. Jordan, it's been 15 minutes. Plus the nine she was already down. Do you want me to call this? Keep going. You know something I don't? I know lots you don't. Okay. Uh, another round of epi and atropine. Pass off. Come on. - What do we got? - Kid's name is Chad Nevins. BP is 90 palp, lost a couple units of blood. Open fracture, midshaft tib-fib. Bone sticking through the skin. I gave him ten of morphine. I could use ten more. All right, let's get him downstairs. - Right now, downstairs! - Ready. Go. Clot's drained. Maybe 200cc's of blood. Pupils are reactive. Come on. We got something. Sinus tach 120. Good radial pulse, too. She's breathing on her own. Rose? Rose, if you can hear me, squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand, Rose. Way to go, Rose. Oh, no! Whoa, decerebrate posturing. Terminal brain reflex. Pupils are fixed and dilated. We lost him. It's okay. There's no flight, there's nothing you can do. I'll just see you in the morning. Love you, too. Don't worry, all right? What? What happened? Blair. He didn't make it. I'm sorry. I really am. This is all my fault. If I'd just... He sustained a head injury, which caused a brain hemorrhage. We did everything we could. Well, couldn't there still be hope? I mean, his heart's beating... We did a scan that shows he has no upper brain function. I'm... I'm sorry. If you'd like a moment alone, I understand... No, no, please stay. You were there, right? Uh, yes, ma'am. Did you talk to him? Only for a little. He was conscious a short time. What did he say? I asked our standard questions: What's your name? Do you know where you are right now? And he answered Nothing else? No. That was it. He's 17 years old. My baby. My sweet, sweet baby. When you, when you wheeled me in, I... I saw them working on Blair. Is-is he okay? We're just going to worry about you right now, okay? There's no dorsalis pedis. There's faint posterior tibial. Between that and the open fractures, he might do best with a BKA. BKA... what...? What's a BKA? It's a below-the-knee amputation. Whoa, way to rock the bedside manner, Darren. Whoa. Wait, you can't hack off my leg! The bones in your lower leg are shattered; the nerves and the arteries are compromised. You'll have better long-term - outcome with a prosthesis. - No. No. No way, man. I can't play football with a fake leg. Chad, you should know, chances are, you're not gonna play with this leg, either. Watch me, okay? I've beat the odds my entire life. Just fix my leg, and I'll do the rest. In the meantime, I gotta go through all this with your folks. My mom's dead, all right My dad's locked up. I live with my older sister, Angela. Anyways, I'm 18. All right? This is my choice. Your letter jacket says you're a junior. I flunked fourth grade. Twice. Okay, I need to talk this over with your sister. What is happening? Do something! Calm down. I'm calling Dr. Yablonski. - Yablonski. - Sir, it's Mr. Ayers. His flow alarm's going off. Breathing's labored and his BP's dropping. It's 'cause the ECMO is drying him out. Give him a unit of packed cells and call me back in five minutes if he doesn't get better. Okay. I need one unit of packed cells, stat! How'd you know she'd come back? I didn't. Then why'd you have me keep going? 'Cause we had time to devote to her You know that period we had no critical patients come in? If we had any, I would've told you to pronounce her and move on. A patient restored with CPR after 20 minutes? That never happens. Today it did. I'd tell you to savor the moment, but we have a patient coming in, in full traumatic arrest. Well, I won't kid you. Reconstructing his leg is an iffy proposition. There's major trauma, bone and tissue loss, not to mention the risk of infection, blood clots. But you think you can save it? Probably, but I don't know how much mobility he'll have. You know, Chad's never really been good in school, but where he shines is on the football field. He thinks it's going to take him to the NFL one day. I... just want him to get into college so he can have some kind of a life. I just want Chad to get his shot. We'll get started as soon as he's stable enough to send to the O.R. I'll let you know how it goes. - Thank you. - Okay. Got a message you were looking for me. Hey, Melissa, yeah. I get the feeling this is about a donor. I hope it's not, because you're on the recipient side, I'm procurement, and we can't go blurring the line. Of course. I already know that Blair Hubbell has been declared brain-dead. I was just wondering if he was one of your patients. Wow, Andy, way to listen. I have a Status 1A heart patient, okay? He and Hubbell have the same blood type. When UNOS assigns an organ, they look at the donor's proximity to the recipient, and in this case, they're in the same hospital. All I'm saying... if the kid's a donor, maybe the stars will line up on this one. I don't know if he's a donor. I haven't talked to the family yet. Okay. Will you give me a heads-up? It's pretty much Hail Mary time for my patient. - I'll let you know when I know. - Thank you. - 360. Everybody off. - Clear. One more time. Everybody off. Clear. Asystole again. We're done, folks. No, n-n-no, you're not. Let's get an amp of epi and a mig of atropine. Let's get an external pacemaker going. Come on people. Let's keep it moving. Miranda. He was in full arrest at the scene. He's been down 35 minutes, his pupils are blown. I'm calling it. The next chopper is three minutes out. Go get yourself some air. Got a dislocated shoulder coming in on the chopper. Two minutes out. All right, I'll get it. Are you sure about that? Well, can you just... can you check again, please? - Tape. - Okay, Doctor. Okay, all right, thanks What's the matter? Something's not right. Call me the minute he's prepped for surgery, please. Hey, any news on the Hubbell kid? He's a donor. UNOS matched his heart with a heart-lung recipient in D.C. Okay. I knew it was a long shot. Thanks for letting me know. Sorry. - So what's going on? - Okay, you told Pam there were 42 people on the bus, right? - Yeah. - Okay. These are names of all the patients who have been brought in here from the crash... 19 so far. All right. These five here have been transported to UPMC. 16 are still on the scene or en route. Now, all of them plus you adds up to 41. Okay, who's missing? Well, I was hoping you could tell me. Have a look. Whose name is not on any of these lists? Antonio Potter. He scored the winning touchdown. Okay, and you're sure he was on the bus? Yeah, I saw him sitting there right after the crash. Was he injured? He had a cut on his head; I don't know how bad. Did you see him later when the first responders showed up? - No. - Okay. Dr. Jordan, we have someone at the scene who's unaccounted for. Call Incident Command, tell them to search the area. If this kid's out there with an untreated head trauma, we should have a surgeon on-scene. Send Miranda. She can hitch a ride out on the next chopper. Okay, now we're going to take care of you. ETA 20 minutes, over. So what's your name, man? George Dirkins, but everyone calls me Big George. - What are you doing? - Uh, this is called a FAST. It's basically a sonogram. I'm just making sure you don't have any internal bleeding which you don't. The upside of being fat... I got my own built-in airbag. What about my shoulder? It hurts like a bitch. It's dislocated. That's looking like your main problem. Yeah, we're going to knock you out for a minute while we reset it. I'd rather not go under. Trust me, you don't want to be awake for this. He's out. Okay All right - You guys set? - Yep. Set? Okay I'm not liking those numbers. His pulse ox is down to 92%. His pulse is up. All right, let's get him some fluids. Give me a two-liter bolus of saline. UNOS New Message No, if the part doesn't come until Tuesday, all our food will go bad. I have two kids I need a fridge that works. I can't go buy another one. I don't have time to buy another one. Look, all a fridge needs to do is be cold. Just make it be cold. Can anyone just fix anything? Wait, wait. Uh, excuse me. - Hello again, I-I was just about to go... - Is this about Brandon? It's really not my place to say. There's a donor, isn't there? Has a heart come in for him? Yes. Oh, my God. I'm gonna go tell Dr. Yablonski. He'll come and talk to you, okay? Thank you. Thank you so much. What? What's going on? A heart, Brandon... a heart! There's a match. It's really going to happen. I don't feel so good. We're on it, okay? We're going to get you feeling better. His O2 sats are still low, even with oxygen. His BP and heart rate are funky, too. George, you got any medical problems we need to know about? No. May be a pulmonary contusion. Could be pneumo, hemo thorax. Let's get a CAT scan on his chest, abdomen, pelvis. IV contrast only. - Okay. - I'll check the stat labs.. - Dr. Yablonski? - Yeah. We got an offer on a heart for Brandon Ayers. Well, that's fabulous news. Show me the specs on the donor. 43-year-old male, Caucasian, car accident. Good-size match, nice EKG. Okay, bite down for me, okay? The only wrinkle is, the donor is unstable. They're saying we need to be there within 90 minutes. And the donor's in Lancaster. Lancaster... 200 miles. We'll send a plane. It'll be tight, but we can pull it off. Call them back and tell them we accept. We need to talk about that, Andy. Uh, I'm taking the heart; it's a no-brainer. Who's going to go get it? I only have a handful of surgeons trained to procure a heart, and I cannot spare any of them, not in the middle of this. My patient has hours to live. He won't catch another break. Then you're going to have to find another way to get that heart here. Dr. Yablonski, Chad Nevins is prepped for surgery in O.R.2. Okay, tell them I'll be right there, thank you. Call back, tell them we accept the offer. Then get someone to procure that heart. How? How am I supposed to do that? Contact the other procurement teams. Check with the on-call surgeon at Lancaster. Be creative, okay, but be quick about it. I want to be able to give the good news to Brandon, but I can't do that until we sort this out. Yeah, about that... No... no, you didn't. His wife saw me heading your way. She figured out it was about him. How did she figure it? Ryan, is she psychic or did you tell her? No, I didn't intend to. It just... it just came out. Oh, Ryan. What if we can't get this heart? What if you'd have come to me an-and I'd have turned it down for some reason? Do you have any idea what Brandon and his family have been through? They've been praying for this moment. They could be in their room celebrating right now. What do we have for them, Ryan? We have nothing. I screwed up. Yes, you did. You screwed up. - What can I do? - Bring that heart. Get it done. - Arnold Briggs. - Yeah, hey. - You the doc from Three Rivers? - Yeah, Miranda Foster. - So where is he... Antonio Potter? - We don't know. What? What do you mean? We just did another sweep of the perimeter. There's no sign of him. I think that this is maybe a mix-up... and that he was already shuttled out. No, n-n-n-n-n-no. This kid has a head injury; there's no way. He probably got disoriented and wandered off, so we should go find him. Then we have our work cut out for us 'cause this is state land and we got wilderness going off in three directions. I'm so sorry about Blair, Mr. Hubbell Me too. They tell me he'll save eight lives. Excuse me? Blair's gonna be an organ donor. There gonna put his name up here. Nice. And... but that's what he would want. What I said to Blair after the game... that's what put him on that bus. My words. He was okay. Honest. It wasn't you, Mr. Hubbell. It was me. What do you mean? He traded seats with me. He was protecting me. Don't even know why. Were not really even friends. Blair's the one who should have walked away. I'm sorry. Don't be. That's Blair That's my son. - Mrs. Ayers. - Dr. Yablonski, what's going on? Why haven't you come talk to us? I... I'm really sorry, I just wanted to wait until we had all our ducks in a row, first. - Well, is there a problem with the heart? - No, the heart's fine. We're... We're dealing with a bus crash in the ER at the moment, and I don't have a procurement team. Wait, are you telling me, that... a heart finally coming for Brandon... but you can't get it? - This is just a bump in the road. - No, I know how this works. If you don't take that heart there gonna give it to someone else. - It's not gonna come to that? - Well, how do you know? - Without that heart, he's gonna die. - Listen to me... I'm pursuing every possible option right now... and I'm gonna find a way. I will find a way. And I will call you the minute I know anything. - What do I tell Brandon? - You don't tell Brandon anything. He needs to stay strong, you go and be with him. - Ok. - Ok? - Yeah. - All right. Ok. - Ryan, I need an update. - I talked to Lancaster. The CT surgeon is tied up doing a bypass.. What about the procurement team? Whoever's getting the lungs, can take the heart. No one's taking the lungs, the donor had pulminary fibrosis. Ok, I got a buddy at Cleveland Clinic, his name is Gonzo Gonzales... According to his assistant, he's about to catch a flight to Puerto Rico. - Andy. - Yeah. - We gotta move on this kid. - Yeah. Okay. I gotta go. Keep trying. Unh! - My stomach's starting to really hurt. - His BP's down too. He's acting like a belly bleed. His abdominal and chest CT's are negative. Transfuse two units of packed cells. Repeat the fase, maybe you missed a bleed. I didn't miss it, something else going on here. The moon's up ahead. So he went this way. - What makes you think he went this way? - I'm guessing. Based on what? How many crashes have you worked, where the drunk driver crosses the yellow line slams head on into the other vehicle? - More than I care to count. - Right. And why do you think that is? Head lights. - The drunks are drawn to the light. - Exactly. It's human instinct. Even when impaired. Hey, Briggs! He's up here, by the river. Okay, we have to get him out of here now. I don't see this kid running a touchdown again. Well, you never know.. I have an hour left. I have an hour to get a heart from 200 miles away. Maybe it's time to make that call tell Lancaster to pass on the heart. - Hello? - Sir, remember how Gonzo, was headed to Puerto Rico. Well I checked his flight. It was cancelled due to bad weather. He may still be around. Should I see if he can help us? Okay, here's what you do. Have Gonzo call me, but don't tell him why. I'm gonna have to sell him on this one. Got it. BP's 40, pap. We're losing him. His neck veins are up. Tamp on it? No, heart sounds aren't muffled It was after we gave him the fluid, that's when he started to go south, right? - Get me ICP Monitor for his Fowley catheter. - Right away. You thinking abdominal compartment syndrome? I think he faced with an elevated PCV, and falling BP. No internal bleeding showed up but we could still have bleeding on the inside. - Guy this big, it wouldn't show up. - Yeah. More fluid increases flowing, putting pressure on the veneous cavity would explain everything we've seen here. If he has flowing inside, it'll read in his bladder. Bladder pressure's at 23 mm. We're definitely looking at ACS. Call the OR. Tell them to clear a room, for a decompression laparotomy. - Right away. - They relieve the pressure, he's as good as new. Nice call. Oh we got another bleeder. Cautery please. Cautery. Not much to work with on some of these vessels. You having second thoughts? - I'm having fourth and fifth thoughts. - Andy? - Yeah? - Got him on line. Thank you, put him through. Hey Andy! It's Gonzo, here at Cleveland Clinic. What's up? Look at you in your internet videoconferencing cell. Well, you know, people speaking to me should also experience my good looks. Whatever... listen, Gonzo... You know that favor you owe me from when I procured that heart for you in Memphis? I owe you? Think again, dude. I picked up two lungs and a heart since then. Not to mention... remember that time we were in Vegas? Okay, okay. Maybe... maybe I owe you, whatever... You're always bragging about the speedy jets your hospital has. How fast do you think one of them can fly 380 miles to Lancaster, PA? - Ryan Abbott. - Good work, Ryan. Gonzo's flying in to procure the heart. But we still need someone to pick it up from the airport. I'd like to do it. Okay. Go boy. # # Okay, a new heart is in. - Let's start to come off heart-lung, please. - Yes, Doctor. Cross-clamp coming out. Have some water here please, Pam. Come on, Brian. Asystole. He's flatline. Paddles. Come on, man. We didn't come this far to stop now. We gotta beat. sync, corrections [HI] elderman www.tvsubtitles.net
