 Previously on Three Rivers: Andy, what's a counselor going to tell us? That you're not a doctor and I'm not a cop? You save lives, Andy. What's more important than that? Having one. When did you get out? Well they paroled me six months ago. I'd like to earn a place back in your life. I have amazing news. People have donated over $150,000? Kuol, this is a game-changer.

 And all it took was a photograph of the great Dr. Yablonski. The bulk of a the money came from an anonymous donor. What do you know about the donor? Just that he sent the money through a lawyer in Mt. Washington. That's your old neighborhood, right? What exactly do you think th money's going to buy you, Michael? Your patient needed help. So I helped him, because I'm your friend. 'Cause I know that if I ever needed your help, you'd be a friend to me. You should get some rest before your meeting. Yo, take it easy, man.

Hi, Michael. Hey. Hi. You here in an official capacity, Detective Yablonski? Hold that. What happened? I was just telling your husband here, this guy came up behind and stuck me. Asked for my money.

We got a report you were stabbed. I knew where you'd go. Were there any witnesses? You know, you used to call me Uncle Mikey. Were there any witnesses, Uncle Mikey? No, I was alone. Andy was just about to write all that down in his the report. I got to go. Thanks, Andy. Bye. The detectives are going to want a statement from you. I'll wait with you till they get here. Yeah, I figured. Let's go, let's go, let's go! I got a 23-year-old firefighter, Jimmy Hanks. Vitals stable, pulse ox 98 on two liters. Chest and head trauma, looks like a right femur fracture. Move these rigs out of here, we got more coming in. Complaining of left b pain. He's had ten of morphine, pain's down to two over ten. Right, I got this one. Next one's yours. Okay. 19-year-old male, severe circumferential chest burns. Pulse ox only 79, pulse 135, bp 90 palp. He's on ten liter, non-rebreathing mask, complaining about difficulty breathing. Okay Bay four, priority, super stat. Okay, your name is Patrick? Yeah. Okay. Please, call my mama. Okay, what do we got? Captain Lance Carlisle. Severe smoke inhalation, minor partial thickness burns. Pulse ox 85, diffuse wheezing. We gave albuterol Neb times two and put him on ten liters. He has a history of lung problems from smoke inhalation. Take him into Bay Three, he's not moving much air. Pull an RSI Kit. I may need to intubate him. Can you sit up for me? I... can't... breathe. All right, we're working on it, buddy. Okay, portable chest and blood gas. O2 at ten ters, albuterol/atrovent nebulizer. What happened to your hands, Patrick? I tried to open the door, but it was too hot. He found some-- what were they? Rubber, like, cleaning gloves? Dish gloves! I tried to open the door with them. The heat from the fire melted the gloves to his hands. We peeled off the rubber and dressed them in the rig. Okay, we got a lot of burn eschar on his chest. It's pretty bad. All right. You're going to be okay. The floor fell in when the lights went out. Okay, okay, okay. Patrick, you're going to be okay. He's bradycardic. Pulse down to 40. Get a point two oftropine, please. Right away. He's out. Give him the sux. He has extensive airwaburns, at least down through the larynx. You said he's suffered smoke inhalation in the past? 20 years of it. Pulse ox down to 70. Well, they all count. Okay, I'm in. Good bilateral breath sounds. Okay. Put him on 100% o2, get me a blood gas, chest X-ray, CBC, chem panel and coags. And get him up to the ICU right away, please. Right away, doctor. Hey. Hang in there, Jimmy. Shooting. Okay, step back, please. How's he doing? After we clear his cervical spine and make sure he's stable, I'm sending him to radiology to ct his head, chest and neck, just to make sure there's no internal injuries. We'll know more after that, okay? Pulse ox is cratering. Okay, let's up the o2 to ten liters, and get a gas going, please. Yes, doctor. Patrick, did you take any drugs? No. Already ran a drug screen. Patrick, did you take any drugs? Oh, my God! Oh, God. Is he going to be okay? Mama, it hurts. Mama, it hurts. Okay, okay. Patrick. Patrick. Tell me what hurts. What hurts? My knees and my shoulders. Mama! Okay, Patrick. Do you know what day it is today? Don't know. I don't know. Okay. Can you please give him something for the pain? Ma'am, we have to be careful. Your son may have taken a narcotic. My son doesn't do drugs. Yeah, but if he did and we give him any pain medication, it could make him stop breathing. Po2 is only 60 on ten liters. Pco2 is high-- it's 55. Okay, he's in respiratory failure. I'm telling you, he's been clean and sober for two years. Ma'am, he was at a rave-- there were a lot of drugs found there. We're just testing everyone. Dr. Foster, Dr. Lee. I pulled the bandage back and saw this. Look at those track marks. All right. Give him two amps of narcan. It's a drug that'll reverse the effects of heroin and other... I know exactly what narcan is. Lord, this can't be happening. Dr.Ganty, please report to burn unit stat. Dr. Ganty, please report... Thanks. Lance is in bad shape. The doctor said his lungs aren't working. How bad? They don't know yet. What about Jimmy? Hmm? He's not so good. His leg's broken, his ribs. They're checking his head. Unbelievable. They'll know more soon. You should have gone in there. Talk to your Captain. I wanted to go. This is exactly the problem with having you on the crew. It was Lance's decision. If Lance had any confidence in you, Jimmy wouldn't have been in there, you would have. Go to hell, Tommy. Why don't you get me transferred, Gwen? You're pretty good at that. Enough. Enough. It always has to come to this? If it was me lying in there, I guess everybody would be happy now. Gwen, that's not true. Speak for yourself. Nice. Why don't you just tell us where Jimmy and the Captain are? Pulse ox is down to 72. The ER's covered. Do you need me in here? Yeah, I do. He's got smoke inhalation on top of chronic lung disease. You going to be able to buy him time for his lungs to heal? I don't know. You know, Andy, he saved that kid's life, gave him his mask. His lower airways aren't burned. Yeah, so what are you thinking? Stay with him. Hey, can we see our guys? This is the doctor? Not yet. I need to get in touch with Lance's family immediately. There's none here. He's got some in Maine. Look, is he going to be all right? He's got no family anywhere in the area? 100 miles? 150 miles? You're looking at it. Sit tight. Hey. Listen up. Priority number one, I need you to get on the UNOS boards, find a pair of lungs for an adult male, blood-type ab-positive. How long do we have. Hours. Just try. All right. So, his lungs are really okay, so it's got to be the drugs, or... Or maybe the skin around his chest is tightening up. Okay. Well, a couple more kids came in from the club. So, I'll go see what other drugs were going around. Okay. Tell me what you took. I didn't take anything. Tell the truth, now. The doctors need to know, so that they can help you. I'm telling the truth, mama. I promise I'm with God, mama. I didn't take anything. He won't tell me what he took. Okay, well, the narcan isn't working. So, he might've taken a non-opiate drug. Do you know... do you know what he's taken in the past? Rock cocaine. Same as me. When he was 15, I found rock in his backpack. I realized he stole it from me. We got clean together. We were doing so good. Okay. Okay. Lo, I know you're busy. It's okay, I got a minute. The detectives from organized crime think that Michael was stabbed by a wise guy named Paul Tieri. Paul Tieri? Do you know him? Well, I did ten years ago. Paul Tieri and my uncle used to steal cargo from PIT International, fenced it in Philly. Your uncle isn't retired. He's doing deals with Tieri, even from prison. Well, I'm not surprised. What did Michael tell you about Tieri? Damn it. Nothing. I mean, he's not gonna tell me anything, he knows better than that. You sure he didn't tell you anything? You think I'd lie to you to protect him? You know, he's a thief. That's all. I won't help him, I'm not part of his life anymore. Dr. Yablonski? I have to go. Yeah? There are no lungs for Lance. Let me show you. I went as far West as Utah and as far South as Texas and Florida. There's just not enough time. Yes? Okay, I'll be there in a minute keep trying. Nurses said you might want a second opinion about whether to take him off the ventilator. I'm not there yet. What do you want to do? Let's put him on ecmo. It'll give us a little more time. Ecmo's a temporary measure. It'll chew up his blood cells, he'll be dead in a week, two at the most. Or it' buy us enough time for a pair of lungs become available. Come on, Andy. You know UNOS isn't gonna give lungs to somebody this sick, with the smoke damage he sustained. And he's not going to get better on an ecmo. He risked his life for a kid downstairs. No, what you need to do is talk to the patient's family. His crew is his family. They're not going to give up on him. Neither am I. Hey. Hey. Drug screen's back. Okay. No drugs. Patrick's completely clean. The drug screen covers greatest hits of recreation drugs, right? Cocaine, heroin, LSD. Right. He still has track marks. Well, who knows what he could've stuck in his arm. I want to check mething. Hey, Tina, emts still here? I think Lori's in the supply room. All right. Hey, Lori. Hey, how's the kid doing? Not good. We found a bunch of track marks. Right arm? That was me-- I was trying to get an IV in but I couldn't find the vein. It was a mess, he wouldn't stop bleeding. No, no, it's okay. It's all right. Happens to the best of us. Thanks. The nurse said you saw his drug screen. Your son didn't take drugs. Thank God. Then why can't he breathe? Okay, ecmo's in. Close him up, please. I'll take care of it, doctor. Thank you. Let me have a 4-0. Hey, how's he doing? Well, we put the ecmo in. If we're really lucky, it'll act as his lungs for a couple of days. Did you find anything? I stopped looking. UNOS can't give lungs to someone with this much preexisting damage. Yeah, I had to... I had to give it a shot. I'm gonna try something. Lance is dying. His lung after years of smoke inhalation, have been pushed over the edge from this final exposure. Without a new pair of lungs, he will die within a day or two. Can't you transplant new lungs into him? I just found out he's too sick to get that priority. So, what are we talking about? There's a new procedure they've pioneered at USC. Each lung has multiple lobes. You've got three on the right and two on the left. What we do is we take one lower lobe from one living donor. And another lower lobe from another living donor, and we put them both into Lance. They'll be big enough? Yes. The lobes are elastic so they'll expand and fit his chest. His firefighting days would be over but he'll live. You need donors. You want us give part of our lungs. Yeah. You'll lose roughly ten percent of your lung capacity. Will we still be able to be firefighters? A lot of guys lost more than that from smoke already, they're still in the department. Well, depending on the damage YT your ability to do your job. Plus, this is major surgery. You'll be out of work for at least two months. And we need to test you to even know if you're a match. I'll do it. Me, too. I'm in. Everybody? Yeah. Okay. We need to go fast. Pulse ox only 70, pulse 155, bp 80 palp. Okay, it's the scar tissue around his chest. What's happening to him? Burnt skin is tightening as it dies. We need to incise the burned skin so his chest can expand and he can breathe. All right, well, let's put him under. Let's start with 50 of etomidate, hang diprivan and prep and drape for escharotomy. You should step outside for this. What are you gonna do to him? We have to make longitudinal incisions through his chest burns so his lungs can expand. Okay? You don't want to see this. Nurse, take her out, please. He's out. Come with me, ma'am. Bp's dropping. Okay. Incising now. Bp's dropping. Henry. You're up. Yeah. Right this way. Hey. How's my man? Well, so far, Jimmy's doing okay. Still some tests to... You hear that? You are doing okay. Yeah, if "okay" means a fractured femur, broken ribs, a concussion and ten percent partial thickness burns. But there is hemorrhagic shock. Nurse with an attitude. Nice. She's the doctor. Who knew? Sorry. Uh, Marco, you're next. You guys okay? We're all doing fine. Captain's not so good. Needs part of someone's lung to survive. Yeah. We're all being tested to see if any of us are a match. Well, I want in. Jimmy, you're stable, but your body's still traumatized. I would not recommend undergoing major surgery right now. I'm not gonna be the only one who's not doing this. Yeah, but you're the only one who's badly injured. So let me be clear. If you do this, you risk your leg not healing properly. Now, you need all the lung capacity to ensure a full recovery. It's my body. Test me. Who's next? He's of sound mind... medically speaking. You can test him. Actually, you know what? I think we're running out of time. I think we should double up. I'm gonna take Gwen. All right? Miranda guys you work with. Yeah, I live with them 24/7. It's not easy. Tell me about it. When I have to go on these procurement runs to some of the smaller hospitals, if my scrubs get dirty, the only replacements they have for me are nurse's colors. And I'm a surgeon, so nobody knows who's in charge. It's stupid. I had a little trouble with a lieutenant. Guy's name was Bill Brin. He kept coming on to me, wouldn't take no for an answer. So I complained, got him transferred out. Now I'm the black sheep. I'm sorry. Yeah. Funny thing is all I ever wanted to be was a firefighter. Look, we're gonna get these results back for you really soon, okay? Of course. Pulse ox is down to 55. He's still not getting enough oxygen? No. You cut him for nothing? He would have died if we hadn't. There's something else going on here. Is there anything in his medical history that would have affected his lungs? Chemical exposure, pneumonia, asthma? No, nothing that I know of. Is my son gonna die? Can't keep going on like this much longer. I can't lose him now. Not after all we've been through. I didn't say we were giving up. Okay? All right. Okay. I want to redo the blood studies and chem panel on Patrick Moss. So what'd the test say? You match. That's great. You have an option not to do this. I mean, we can say you weren't a match, and no one will ever know. This is... this is completely confidential really? Is there another donor? We're still waiting for all the results. Nobody will know, right? No. Look, I can't do it. I got two kids at home, and I... Maybe I'm just scared. I don't know. But I can't do it. Hey, it's okay. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Hey. How you doing? What's it say? You are a match. Wow. That's great. And understand, you have an option not to do this. Oh, hell, yeah, I'm doing it. I mean, Captain's like a father to me. Only he beats me less. Okay. Well, uh, go ahead and wait at the front. If we get another donor, I'll get you admitted and prepped for surgery. That's it? Well, that and a bunch of paperwork. Awesome. All right, thanks. Okay, there's more coming in. Good. Wait a minute. We're testing Jimmy Hanks? He's just had major trauma. Listen, I told him that, but it's his choice. Hey may not even match. Well, maybe we won't need him. Here's another one. Figures it'd be me. If you choose not to donate, we'll just tell them you weren't a match. We do it with family members all the time. Your privacy will be completely protected. You know that guy I told you about? Lieutenant Brin. Yeah. He did more than come on to me. One ght, I'm coming out of the bathroom, and the other guys were downstairs. Lieutenant Brin pushed me back inside and kissed me. I pushed him away. He pulled my shirt over my head. I couldn't see. He covered my mouth, my nose, I couldn't breathe... Gwen, please. You don't have to justify your decision. I slit his face with my razor. He would have beat the hell out of me, but Jimmy walked in. Did you tell the cops? I told Lance. He said the department would see it as a "he said, she said"" that if I didn't say anything to anybody, he'd transfer Brin to another crew. The only person who knows anything about it is Jimmy and you. What happened to the lieutenant, was he charged? A month ago, I found out when Brin was transferred, he received a raise in rank. Wow. And now I'm just supposed to give a part of my body to the guy that let him get away with that. I think you should take a little more time with this. No. No, I don't need more time. Lance can go to hell. I'm not doing it. Bp's crashg. Why the hypetension? You see this? See that? Suaclavicular cyanosis? Yeah, what do you think, pericardial tamponade? It would explain the hypotension. Yeah, but not the organs shutting down. Bring the ultrasound over here. Thank you. Yolanda, I need you to step away for a second. Oh, please, lord, I'm asking you. Deliver my child. 300cc's squeezing his heart. What's happening? The sac around his heart is filling up with blood. It's not allowing his heart to beat. We need to drain this. Prep and drape for pericardiocentesis. Bring me the PC kit. You want this one? Okay. Hear my cry, lord. Heal my child. Deliver him. 45 degree angle. Draw back as you advance. Run of five. Okay, back off, back off. Aim a little right. Okay. Okay, got it. That's it. All right. Okay, that's supposed to be blood. What the hell's going on? Hey. Hey, girl. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. You know, got everything you need. Mm. I'm good. You okay? Heard a couple of the guys are giving you a hard time. Mm. It's nothing new. Don't worry about me. We should just tell them, Gwen. They wouldn't be so rough on you if they knew... No, no. There'd be a department investigation. No other crew would have me. My career would be over. Got to get you ready for surgery, Mr. Hanks. Surgery? I'm a match. It came down to me and Tommy. I'm giving a lobe to Lance. You can do that after what you went through? They said there's a chance that my leg might not heal right. The bone might be too weak. That could be your career. You'd be done. That might not happen. Besides, it's the Captain. I got to do it, right? Okay. He's got effusion, not blood, in his pericardium. There's got to be some underlying disease causing that. His pulse is down to 110, but his breathing is still labored. There's something systemic going on. Start over. Let's forget about the fire. What do we know? Pericardial effusion, multiple organ failure. What is it? What is it, Patrick? His knees. His knees. His knees and his shoulders-- he's been complaining about them for months now. He was complaining about that earlier. Joint inflammation. Joint inflammation. Rising hepatic enzymes. And what did the EMT say? She said that when she tried to start an IV on Patrick, that... He was bleeding all over the place. Okay. Exactly. All right. Well, forget the scan for now. I want to look at him under a bright light. Thank you. Turn this on. I want to look at him under a bright lightYeah. Okay, there-- you see these bumps on his shins? Erythema nodosum? I think so. Yeah, they're usually harder to see on a person with dark skin. Yeah. Looks like superficial skin burns. Here, on his right leg-- do you see that? Yeah. So, joint inflammation, erythema nodosum, rising enzymes. Pericardial effusion... And bleeding easily. His hands. We didn't see his hands. What's it got to do with his hands? You see how his fingers are gettg all blunt and stubby? I never noticed that. Well, these three symptoms-- the bumps on his leg, the clubbing and the joint pain-- are what's called lofgren's syndrome, and it's an indication of... Sarcoidosis. It's an autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the lungs-- makes it hard to breathe. It's also causing everything we're seeing here from his enzyme elevation to the fluid accumulation around his heart to the bleeding. It's a preexisting condition. The fire and the burns on the chest just exacerbated it. Let's get him started with 250 milligrams of solu-cortef. Is he going to be okay? If we're right... yeah. Time to go, buddy. Go get 'em. We'll be waiting for you. Jimmy, you're the best. I'm doing it. Not Jimmy. What are you talking about? I just heard I'm a match. You're not 100%. Means I'm best man for the job. You sure about this? I wouldn't let my Captain die in a fire. Not gonna let him die here. It's how we do it. It'll be just a minute. It's cold. Yeah. It is. Hey, Gwen. I just want to tell you I think it's a hell of a thing you're doing. It took this, Tommy? Me giving a piece of my body? It was all stupid, Gwen. It was so stupid. I'm sorry. This scares the hell out of me. Hey, guys. We're okay? Yeah. Okay. Ready when you are. Hey, Tommy.

Nobody can know I talked to you. An organized crime Detective recognized you and came to me out of professional courtesy. So, they... they have a photo of me and my Uncle. So what? Paul Tieri, the guy who stabbed your uncle, was found shot in the face on a rooftop in Northview Heights. Michael's a murderer. They know he's been laundering money. Listen, this has got nothing to do with me, Rena. And that he recently donated a large sum for a Sudanese patient of yours, Kuol. Okay. That donation was 100% legitimate. They know you have a relationship with him. Wh-what, do they want me to rat him out? I'm not going to do that. If you don't, they're going to seize the money for Kuol. Rena, you... you can't let this happen. Okay, Kuol needs that heart. He's going to die without . It's not up to me. I'm just looking out for you. Yeah, you always did. Your date's waiting.
