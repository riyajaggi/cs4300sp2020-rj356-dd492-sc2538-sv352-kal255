 {\an2}They say that the Nine Olde Witches {\an2}sealed the Grand Triskellion in the Forest of Arcturus. {\an2}To unseal it, you need the Seven Words {\an2}and a wand with seven stars. {\an2}Day seven of our early morning lessons! {\an2}-Are you ready, Akko? -Yes! {\an2}A monkey! {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse! {\an2}Not too bad. {\an2}Next, an elephant! {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse!

 {\an2}Okay. That's good. {\an2}Hey! {\an2}Oh, my! {\an2}Hey! Don't come near me! {\an2}Professor Ursula, thank you so much as always. {\an2}I think it was perfect until halfway through. {\an2}Sure. {\an2}I'm going to keep practicing, {\an2}and when I've mastered transformation magic, {\an8}I will become a Moonlit Witch like Chariot! {\an2}Chariot was chosen as the Moonlit Witch at Luna Nova's Samhain Festival. {\an2}The Moonlit Witch... {\an2}The most exemplary witch is crowned with that honor! {\an2}I heard Chariot was chosen for her miraculous transformation magic.

 {\an2}I thought you'd know that, Professor Ursula. {\an2}You're right! {\an2}That's correct! Yes, yes. {\an2}Hey, the festival is coming up soon! {\an2}I'm going to practice very hard so I can be like Chariot! {\an2}Now, what should I transform into tomorrow? {\an2}Akko has revived the first word. {\an2}Now she has revived two. {\an2}There are a total of seven words. {\an2}Revive the rest of them. {\an2}Chariot, you must help her. {\an2}I'm gonna be the Moonlit Witch! {\an2}Extra! Extra! {\an2}The list of the witches attending the festival has been released! {\an8}Miss Marjolaine, the rock star? {\an8}Minister Dorlin of the East Mogiana Republic! {\an8}Madame Ural, too! What an amazing lineup! {\an8}Madame Ural is a Nobel Prize-winning authority on magic novels. {\an8}Witches from all over the world! {\an2}I'm so excited! I can't wait for the festival! {\an2}Does Akko know? {\an2}I can't tell her now. {\an2}I can't wait to see the worldly witches! {\an2}On October 31, {\an2}we will celebrate the Samhain Festival, {\an2}which has been our school's tradition for 1,600 years. {\an2}It's a perfect time to show the ability of Luna Nova students to our alumni! {\an2}Students will be divided into teams to work on their presentations. {\an2}This is from the last festival. {\an2}Boiling of toads for enchantments. {\an2}Memorizing 10,000 incantations. {\an2}The ancient dark dance. {\an2}A full course medieval magic dinner. {\an2}-Seriously? -Is the festival really this lame? {\an2}And at the end of the festival, {\an2}the most talented witch will be chosen out of all the students, {\an2}and crowned the Moonlit Witch. {\an2}The Moonlit Witch, just like Chariot. {\an2}Now, each one of you will be assigned a duty at the festival. {\an2}Team leaders, please come forward and draw fairy lots. {\an2}-Who's going to draw? -It's gotta be Akko. {\an2}No! I have such a bad luck with these things! {\an2}Me, too. {\an2}Hi! You are in charge of the fireworks! {\an2}Fireworks magic? {\an2}-You are so lucky! -Oh, man, they got that one. {\an2}You are in charge of the decorations! {\an2}I guess that's all right. {\an2}You are in charge of summoning magic! {\an2}Summoning magic? It's the highlight of the festival! {\an2}You are in charge of cleaning! {\an2}-Gross! -Cleaning? {\an2}The rest of the team leaders, come forward, quickly! {\an2}We have to decide! {\an2}-It's gotta be Akko. -I can't! {\an2}The leader of the team over there, come forward now! {\an2}-Sucy! No, it's Lotte! -Right now! {\an2}Akko! {\an2}Let's see... {\an2}This one? {\an2}Wait, I don't feel good about that one. Or-- {\an2}Hurry up and pick, or I'll tear out your fingernails! {\an2}Fine! There! {\an2}You get sacrifice duty. {\an2}Sacrifice duty? {\an2}What is that? {\an2}For those in charge of the sacrifice... {\an2}This vase contains an old ghost, Vajarois the Grieving. {\an2}Vajarois the Grieving? {\an2}Vajarois will wake at the stroke of midnight {\an2}and go on a wailing rampage. {\an8}-That's why we make a sacrifice. -What? {\an2}Once Vajarois eats the sacrifice, {\an2}it will go back to sleep until the next Samhain Festival. {\an2}Are we going to die? {\an2}There is no danger to your life. {\an2}The sacrifice passes through the ghost's body. {\an2}No way! {\an2}That's hilarious! Sacrifice duty! {\an2}There's nothing more perfect for Akko! {\an2}Be quiet! {\an2}It's time to take the festival seriously. {\an2}If you want to chat, do it later. {\an2}That's right. {\an2}And Diana Cavendish, {\an2}after a vote was cast the other day, {\an2}you were chosen as Luna Nova's youngest ever {\an2}Samhain Festival executive committee chairman. {\an2}-Amazing, Diana! -Way to go, Diana! {\an2}Everyone, let's do our best to help Diana make this festival a great success! {\an2}Yes! {\an2}Sacrifice duty? What the heck? {\an2}I thought the festival was supposed to be a fun event. {\an2}The ritual where the ghost eats the sacrifice... What's with that? {\an2}"Vajarois the Grieving was a member {\an2}of the royal family of the Book Kingdom back around 200 B.C. {\an2}She was surrounded by good friends and had a happy life. {\an2}But after losing her friends in her later years, {\an2}Vajarois cried over how sad the world had become, {\an2}and became the grieving ghost." {\an2}That's the only reason? {\an2}She cries even while sleeping, {\an2}which is why she gets so hungry and has to eat the sacrifice. {\an2}Do you want some? {\an2}Hey, Vajarois! {\an2}This is all because you are such a crybaby! {\an2}Jeez! I'm the one who wants to cry! {\an2}I've been practicing so hard so I can be the Moonlit Witch like Chariot! {\an2}You mean, you want to be chosen as the Moonlit Witch? {\an2}That might be difficult. {\an2}I bet Diana will be the Moonlit Witch. {\an2}I think so, too. {\an2}Right? {\an2}How can you guys say that? {\an2}I mean, she comes from a prestigious witch family. {\an2}She was born with so many talents. {\an2}So you don't want to be the Moonlit Witch, Lotte? {\an2}I'm only here to learn magic so I can take over the magic tools store. {\an2}What about you, Sucy? {\an2}I'm actually excited about passing through a ghost's body. {\an2}Unbelievable. {\an2}Jeez! {\an2}-This is unbelievable. -Right? {\an2}Not that. {\an2}You can't even fly a broom, {\an2}but you're dreaming of being the Moonlit Witch? Unbelievable. {\an2}-That's true. -I guess. {\an2}It can't be helped. {\an2}It was a lottery. {\an2}You were just getting ahead of yourself. {\an2}It suits you perfectly. {\an2}Well, then, let's have the sacrifice team meeting now-- {\an2}You guys are awful! {\an2}We're in charge of the mirror for the festival. {\an2}That's what we wanted to talk to you about, Diana. {\an2}We gathered all the mirrors we can find, but we're not sure which one to pick. {\an2}So we want you to pick the best one for us. {\an2}Of course. {\an2}Out of all these... {\an2}Let's see. This one has the strongest magic. {\an2}But it seems to love pranks. {\an2}If you polish it with fairy powder, you can keep it under control. {\an2}Really? {\an2}I'll talk to the professors. We can go get it together. {\an2}Thank you, Diana! {\an2}No wonder you're the executive committee chairman! {\an2}We can count on you! {\an2}You will definitely be the Moonlit Witch! {\an2}Thank you. {\an2}But we still don't know who will be picked as the Moonlit Witch. {\an2}That was close! {\an2}Wait. Why do I need to hide? {\an2}Don't be so stubborn. {\an2}You wish you were born with many talents, don't you? {\an2}Like this. {\an2}Seriously? {\an2}Diana? {\an2}-Oh, Diana. -Crap! {\an2}This schedule you've made for the festival is impressive. {\an2}Let's discuss the details. {\an2}Well... {\an2}-My stomach... -Are you all right? {\an2}Will you... Will you excuse me for a moment? {\an2}How did this happen? {\an2}Diana! {\an2}Diana! {\an2}We've got a problem. {\an2}We can't figure out how to read this summoning spell. {\an2}It's this page. {\an2}Can you tell us, please? {\an2}Diana? {\an2}This is terrible. {\an2}Since you both saw this spell, you are already under the curse! {\an2}-What? -A curse? {\an2}You will become 82 years old within 24 hours if you don't do anything. {\an2}-Eighty... -Two? {\an2}No! {\an2}Please help us, Diana! {\an2}Put both hands on top of your head. {\an2}Like this? {\an2}That's right! And now I'm going to... {\an2}write a spell on you to release the curse. {\an2}This is it! {\an2}If you leave it on until tomorrow morning, the curse will be broken. {\an2}-Until tomorrow morning? -Okay! {\an2}Now, I have other things to do. {\an2}-Thank you, Diana! -You saved us! {\an2}Oh, crap... {\an2}Oh, Miss Diana, sorry about that. {\an2}I just finished cleaning your room. {\an2}Oh, right. Diana's room is down the hall. {\an2}Miss Diana. {\an2}Aren't you heading to your room? {\an2}Oh, that's right. I'm heading to my room right now! {\an2}That was close. {\an2}So this is Diana's room. {\an2}I guess it's not very nice to go into someone else's room. {\an2}-Miss Diana. -Crap! {\an2}I forgot to mention earlier. {\an2}Your friend stopped by while I was cleaning. {\an2}-I see. Thank you for letting me know. -Goodbye now. {\an2}Thank you so much. {\an2}Jeez, what the heck? {\an2}This is amazing! {\an2}Is this Diana's diary? {\an2}No, no! I can't read it! {\an2}Diana! {\an2}-I heard a voice inside. -She must be back. {\an2}We're coming in! {\an2}Diana! {\an2}We need your advice! {\an2}What kind of advice do you need? {\an2}This is the welcoming artwork for the festival. {\an2}We were able to bring the statue of the Great Witch, Jennifer, {\an2}but the professors want us to change her pose. {\an2}We want to use the giving-life magic, but it's too hard for us. {\an2}You're the only one who can help us. {\an2}Of course you can count on me! {\an2}There is nothing I can't do! {\an2}Thank you, Diana! {\an2}Stay back, everyone! {\an2}I can do this. {\an2}I've been practicing the transformation magic so much! {\an2}So this should be... {\an2}Ansolew Airo! {\an2}Ansolew Airo! Ansolew Airo! {\an2}What happened, Diana? {\an2}Are you not feeling well? {\an2}Isn't it the wrong spell? {\an2}Well... {\an2}Ansolew Airo! {\an2}Akko! {\an2}I'm back? {\an2}I can explain. {\an2}I bet it's because of that mirror. {\an2}Diana? {\an2}By the way, {\an2}I just had a meeting with Lotte and Sucy about your sacrifice duty. {\an2}You forgot, didn't you? How irresponsible! {\an2}I'm sorry. {\an2}I was just so disappointed about having to do the sacrifice duty. {\an2}So that's why you played a prank? {\an2}You get mad and lose interest as soon as things don't go your way. {\an2}You want to be like Chariot, {\an2}but you know nothing of the history or tradition of magic. {\an2}You have no right to study here! {\an2}I have what it takes! {\an2}I'm serious about wanting to be like Chariot. {\an2}Serious? You? {\an2}I'll prove it. {\an2}My passion for magic is stronger than anyone here! {\an2}I, Atsuko Kagari, will be chosen as the Moonlit Witch at the Samhain Festival! {\an2}-What was that? -No idea. {\an2}Diana is amazing. {\an2}Long ago, the world was filled with the power of good magic. {\an2}Now, however, the power of magic continues to decline. {\an2}By finding the Grand Triskellion, {\an2}I want to contribute to the revival of magic. {\an2}Compared to her, I'm such a... {\an2}I hear you declared in front of everyone that you will be the Moonlit Witch? {\an2}Professor Ursula. {\an2}I just blurted it out in the moment, {\an2}even though I know I have zero chance. {\an2}Zero? {\an2}I hate to admit it, but they are right. {\an2}Diana is amazing. {\an2}She's mature beyond my imagination. {\an2}She's someone I can't even reach. {\an2}Compared to her, I'm still such a child. {\an2}Yes, you have a tendency to not consider the consequences, {\an2}but that's something you can work on. {\an2}But I would imagine {\an2}that Chariot also made many mistakes and felt down sometimes. {\an2}I wonder what Chariot would do? {\an2}The Big Dipper is so beautiful. {\an2}Beyond that twinkles the North Star, Polaris. {\an2}Professor Ursula? {\an2}If Chariot was here, she might say something like this. {\an2}"Don't compare yourself to anyone else. There are some things only you can do." {\an2}Please take care of it. {\an2}Yes. {\an2}-Professor Ursula-- -Well, good night! {\an2}Something only I can do... {\an2}This is... {\an2}This is... {\an2}It's the same place from before, {\an2}the Fountain of Polaris. {\an2}Please tell me! What is something only I can do? {\an2}Chariot! {\an2}You're here! {\an2}What's with that outfit? It's so old and dirty! {\an2}This must be a vision of someone who once knew Chariot. {\an2}Oh, jeez. {\an2}-Chariot is having so much fun! -Watch this! When I chant, {\an2}I get so much energy! {\an2}Arae Aryrha! {\an2}Oh, no! My head is spinning! {\an2}Jeez. Come on. {\an2}Arae Aryrha! {\an2}Open the mind! {\an2}Chariot is amazing! {\an2}Let's laugh together! {\an2}Arae Aryrha! {\an2}Maybe Chariot wasn't practicing her magic just to be the Moonlit Witch. {\an2}Maybe it was for a simpler... {\an2}Arae Aryrha. {\an2}Wait. It's a spell? {\an2}This is... {\an2}I got it! I know what I can do! {\an2}Translated by: Lana Sofer {\an2}-Until... -Tomorrow morning.
