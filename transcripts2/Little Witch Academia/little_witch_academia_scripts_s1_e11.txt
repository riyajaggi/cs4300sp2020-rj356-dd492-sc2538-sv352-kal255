 {\an2}Sosomme Tiextrilla. {\an2}Come on! {\an2}The last piece! {\an2}It's backwards! {\an2}I did it! {\an2}Too bad. {\an2}It was close. {\an2}Attempt 100 of repair magic. You almost have it. {\an2}That was attempt 101. {\an2}It's all right, you'll get it tomorrow... {\an2}I think.

 {\an2}I'm not so sure. {\an2}It's already been a month {\an2}since I started Professor Ursula's after-school lessons. {\an2}She is such a nice person, doing that for you every day. {\an2}Yet I haven't improved at all. {\an8}Maybe I'm just hopeless. {\an2}Akko is actually depressed. {\an2}The dead must be rolling in their graves. {\an2}I want to meet Chariot. {\an2}I want to ask her how I can be like her. {\an2}It's been ten years since her last magic show. {\an2}Where did Chariot go? Why did she suddenly disappear? {\an2}Where is she now? {\an2}I bet Chariot fell in forbidden love.

 {\an2}She followed her lover on a long journey. {\an2}I bet she was poisoned and turned into a rock. {\an2}Chariot would never make such a mistake. {\an2}I wonder if Professor Ursula knows anything. {\an2}Both of them were students here, right? {\an2}They're close in age, so they could have been classmates-- {\an2}Classmates? {\an2}It's possible. {\an2}I'll go ask... {\an2}Professor Ursula! {\an2}But it's so late. {\an2}I bet she's in her room. {\an2}Welcome to the land of magic! {\an2}Professor, I need to talk to you! {\an2}What is it? {\an2}Professor, your glasses. {\an2}I'm sorry, I usually don't get any visitors... {\an2}Your familiar is a crow! {\an2}Good evening. I'm Akko. {\an2}Would you like some tea? {\an2}So, what did you want to talk about? {\an2}You were a student here, right? {\an2}What? {\an2}Did you ever meet Shiny Chariot? {\an2}-Were you classmates by any chance? -Well... {\an2}Really? Classmates? {\an2}Maybe... {\an2}You were really classmates! {\an2}Wow. {\an2}What was Chariot like? {\an2}Did she stand out in class? {\an2}Kind of. {\an2}She was beautiful, wasn't she? {\an2}Yes, you can say that. {\an2}Why did Chariot disappear? {\an2}Where is she? And what is she doing? {\an2}Well... {\an2}I thought so. {\an2}I'm sorry I couldn't help you. {\an2}-I've... -What? {\an2}Ever since I saw her show, I've dreamed that someday I'd be like Chariot. {\an2}I still believe it. {\an2}But sometimes... I get scared. {\an2}If I could meet Chariot, I'd ask her, {\an2}"Is it really possible for me to be like you?" {\an2}Professor? {\an2}A long time ago, there was a person whom I called "professor," too. {\an2}One day, the professor told me, {\an2}"Phaidoari Afairrynghor." {\an2}Phaidoari Afairrynghor? {\an2}"You don't get that which you dream of, {\an2}but what you work hard for." {\an2}No matter what, you should take care of Shiny Rod. {\an2}Wow, the moon is blue. {\an2}That's right. It's a blue moon tonight. {\an2}I see. According to the latest reports, {\an2}the number of witches is decreasing every year. {\an2}Yes. {\an2}They say magic power keeps decreasing all over the world, as well. {\an2}The great Nine Olde Witches. {\an2}When those nine witches founded this school, {\an2}there was an abundance of magic in the world. {\an2}Luna Nova's glory days were 1,600 years ago. {\an2}Since when... {\an2}did we witches become unable to use magic without the Sorcerer's Stone? {\an2}Excuse me. It's Diana. {\an2}Diana, please come in. {\an2}I'm looking for a particular book. {\an2}An ancient manuscript on the Nine Olde Witches. {\an2}I couldn't find it in the library, but thought you might know. {\an2}The book on ancient magic, yes? {\an2}It's in the oldest archives in Luna Nova. {\an2}Only special people are allowed but... {\an2}I will give you permission to look through it. {\an2}Thank you very much. {\an2}Oh, Diana. {\an2}You should go see when the moon rises in the sky. {\an2}It's a blue moon tonight. {\an2}With the magic of the blue moon, something mysterious could happen. {\an2}Phaidoari Afairrynghor. {\an2}"You don't get that which you dream of, but what you work hard for." {\an2}That's right. It's a blue moon tonight. {\an2}A dream? {\an2}I got it! {\an2}There it is! {\an2}Hey, do you know what a blue moon is? {\an2}When there are two full moons in a month, {\an2}you call the second a blue moon. {\an2}It only happens once every few years. {\an8}There is an ancient ghost who appears only on a blue moon... {\an8}It is ill-tempered and eccentric, {\an8}but has vast knowledge about the past, present and future. {\an2}It will answer questions for those it likes. {\an2}It will answer questions... {\an2}This is my only chance in the next few years. {\an2}A ghost will appear in the Blue Moon Abyss. {\an2}Luna Nova's New Moon Tower. {\an2}It says there is a cave called the Blue Moon Abyss under the chapel. {\an2}That's where the ghost appears. {\an2}According to the legend, {\an2}the entrance to the cave only appears on a blue moon. {\an2}The cave's entrance... {\an2}So the Blue Moon Abyss is down here. {\an2}In this world, {\an2}there exists a witch's secret, handed down from the megalithic civilization. {\an2}The secret, called Grand Triskellion, has the power to change the world. {\an2}In the seventh century, the Nine Olde Witches {\an2}sealed the Grand Triskellion in the Forest of Arcturus. {\an2}"The only thing that can open the seal {\an2}is a wand with seven stars, Claiomh Solais. {\an2}And... {\an2}the Seven Words of Arcturus." {\an2}Seven Words? {\an2}Noctu Orfei Aude Fraetor. {\an2}Aim for the ideal place. {\an2}The day she came to Luna Nova, Akko activated the first word. {\an2}The wand! {\an2}Noctu Orfei. {\an2}Noctu... {\an2}Orfei. {\an2}Aude! {\an2}Aude. {\an2}-Fraetor! -Fraetor! {\an2}Shiny... {\an2}Arc! {\an2}She doesn't even realize... {\an2}Akko! {\an2}Chariot may have come here once, too. {\an2}Why have you come? {\an2}Why have you come? Go home! Go home! {\an2}Chariot! {\an2}Finally... {\an2}I get to see you. {\an2}I saw your magic show. {\an2}I came to Luna Nova because I want to be a witch like you. {\an2}What can I do to become like you? {\an2}You are my only dream! {\an2}You must have begun to realize... {\an2}no matter how far you reach, {\an2}your dream won't come true. {\an2}It's not true. {\an2}Chariot would not say that! {\an2}Chariot is the one who taught me {\an2}that it's my belief in myself that makes up my magic. {\an2}Who are you? {\an2}The ghost of the blue moon? {\an2}Are you behind the fake Chariot? Are you mocking me? {\an2}Why are you here? {\an2}There's something I want to ask. {\an2}You can answer all questions about the past, present and future, can't you? {\an2}Not all. {\an2}But what I cannot answer, nobody can. {\an2}I want you to tell me about my future. {\an2}Can I really become a witch like Chariot? {\an2}Foolishness. {\an2}This is more important to me than my life! {\an2}Is this the future you wish? {\an2}That's my... dream. {\an2}Step through the door. {\an2}The future will be yours. {\an2}But when you get the bright future, you will lose your past. {\an2}What do you mean? {\an2}The future comes with a price. {\an2}You must sacrifice your past. {\an2}Your useless past... {\an2}will be erased. {\an2}Wait! {\an2}Don't erase them! {\an2}My past is full of failures {\an2}and almost nothing went right, {\an2}but I don't want to erase those memories! {\an2}Why? {\an2}They are not worth saving. {\an2}The tears, the frustrations, the laughs... {\an2}they're all mine. No one else's. {\an2}They're everything I have done. {\an2}I did my best! {\an2}I'm not going to erase them! {\an2}Are you all right... {\an2}with not becoming Chariot? {\an2}I can be! {\an2}I will be an amazing witch through my own hard work. {\an2}The professor taught me... {\an2}"You don't get that which you dream of, but what you work hard for." {\an2}Phaidoari... {\an2}Afairrynghor! {\an2}It's been a while. {\an2}Some time has passed since I saw you last, Professor Woodward. {\an2}Is that you, Chariot? {\an2}It looks as though the lost Claiomh Solais has been revived. {\an2}You tested this girl. {\an2}Just as you tested me, long ago. {\an2}She seems to be quite stubborn. {\an2}She brought back the word. {\an2}Phaidoari Afairrynghor. {\an2}Akko also revived the first word. {\an2}Now she has revived two. {\an2}There are a total of seven words. {\an2}Revive the rest of them. {\an2}Chariot... {\an2}you must help her. {\an2}Akko, I will tell you the truth someday. {\an2}Translated by: Lana Sofer
