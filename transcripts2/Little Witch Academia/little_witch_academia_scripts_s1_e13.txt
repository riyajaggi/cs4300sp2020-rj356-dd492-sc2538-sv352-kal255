 {\an2}At the end of the Samhain Festival, {\an2}Vajarois will appear when the bell tolls at midnight. {\an2}Vajarois, who cannot forget the sadness of losing dear friends, {\an2}cries as she devours the sacrifices in one bite. {\an2}So that's going to be us. {\an2}Just thinking about it makes me... {\an2}So excited. {\an2}I know! {\an2}Let's make Vajarois laugh at this sacrifice ceremony! {\an2}What? {\an2}Chariot was chosen as the Moonlit Witch because of her transformation magic.

 {\an2}But she didn't want to be chosen. {\an2}I think she was just filled with this desire to excite everyone. {\an2}So, let's make Vajarois the Grieving laugh with our transformation magic, {\an2}and make this a fun performance! {\an2}Why? {\an2}I mean, don't you think it's an awful ceremony, {\an2}just watching Vajarois cry while eating the sacrifices? {\an2}Magic has to be more fun and exciting! {\an2}Magic should make people happy! {\an2}-Like Chariot... -You know what? {\an2}Why do you have to take it so far? {\an2}Nobody asked you to do that. {\an2}I think we should just do as it's been done before. {\an2}But then Vajarois will be sad forever!

 {\an2}We should do transformation magic that will wipe away her tears! {\an2}But this ceremony has been done the same way for years. {\an2}Besides... {\an2}Akko still can't even perform basic transformation magic. {\an2}That's... {\an2}true, but... {\an2}Akko... {\an2}I understand what you're trying to do. {\an2}But we can't always go along with what you want. {\an2}But I want everyone to see that magic is fun! {\an2}I'm going to do my best so you two will see it, too! {\an2}Just watch! {\an2}I see. {\an2}I don't want to give up. {\an2}Lotte and Sucy think we should have the normal sacrifice ceremony. {\an2}But I thought if we used the same magic as Chariot at the festival, {\an2}we could get everyone excited. {\an2}The magic Chariot used at the festival? {\an2}Arae Aryrha. {\an2}That's the third word. {\an2}Do your best, Akko! {\an2}I will do some research on Vajarois the Grieving. {\an2}You should continue with your practice. {\an2}Yes. {\an2}Thank you so much. {\an2}I'll come by if I have any questions. {\an2}Of course. I'm here for you any time! {\an2}The reason Vajarois wails in sadness... {\an2}I'm sure Lotte and Sucy will understand once they see that I can do this right! {\an2}Hey, Akko! {\an2}How dare you trick us the other day! {\an2}So sorry about that. {\an2}You really think an apology is enough? {\an2}Seriously! {\an2}Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was? {\an2}-Well... -But... {\an2}We'll forgive you, since the three of you have to be the poor sacrifices. {\an2}I can't wait to see everyone laughing at you. {\an2}You are so perfect for the sacrifice! {\an2}Akko the idiot. Sucy the creep. {\an2}And doesn't-matter-if-she's-there-or-not, Lotte the invisible. {\an2}You three are just a pack of losers! {\an2}What's with your face? Nothing to say? {\an2}Why are you getting mad? We're just telling the truth! {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse! {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse! {\an2}About 30 years ago they succeeded with the greenhouse culture... {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse... {\an2}"Doesn't-matter-if-she's-there-or-not, Lotte the Invisible." {\an2}Focus, everyone! The festival is almost here! {\an2}Yes! {\an2}Let's see. This is it! {\an2}"The first Princess Vajarois of the Book Kingdom... {\an2}The reason she wanders around after her death {\an2}is said to be related to a curse." {\an2}That's it? {\an2}I guess I have to look for older resources. {\an2}"Vajarois's vestige is kept at the Luna Nova Archive Library." {\an2}It's been three weeks. Akko is practicing so hard. {\an2}Three weeks and three days. She's not getting better at all. {\an2}Hey, Sucy. {\an2}Why do you think Akko can be the way she is? {\an2}Whether she fails or gets hurt, she continues to reach for the unreachable. {\an2}Probably because she's an idiot. She just doesn't know when to quit. {\an2}I think it's amazing. {\an2}Hey, this is... "Trick or Treat Plan"? {\an2}Why? Why can't I do it? {\an2}Lotte. Sucy. {\an2}You really can't do anything on your own, can you? {\an2}But maybe the three of us can do something together. {\an2}We gave it some thought. {\an2}We think it will be better if you're the only one {\an2}who uses transformation magic, and we focus on assisting you. {\an2}Even if you fail, the two of us can cover you, so... {\an2}Then... {\an2}Watching you made me remember... {\an2}the excitement I felt when I talked to a spirit for the first time. {\an2}That feeling when magic was so much fun. {\an2}So I thought it may not be a bad idea to have fun with you, Akko. {\an2}-Thank you, you two! -I can't breathe. {\an2}I'm going to make it happen no matter what! {\an2}The Samhain Festival is finally here! {\an2}Alumni witches are on their way here from all over the world. {\an2}Vajarois's vestige must be in here somewhere. {\an2}But where? {\an2}The lights are lit on the special stage in Luna Nova's athletic field! {\an8}Our special guests, Miss Marjolaine, Minister Dorlin and Ural are watching {\an8}as we wait to hear the opening statement from Diana Cavendish, {\an2}our festival executive committee chair! {\an2}I'm here to announce the opening of the Luna Nova Samhain Festival! {\an2}And at the end of the festival, {\an2}the most excellent witch will be chosen from all the current students... {\an2}and will be given the title of the Moonlit Witch! {\an2}Now, who will be crowned Moonlit Witch? {\an2}This isn't it. This isn't it, either! {\an2}The festival has already started! {\an2}Not too bad. {\an2}Here comes the cleaning team, the Sweeper Girls! {\an2}There, there, there, there! Constanze! {\an2}-Oh, no! She's been eaten! -No! Please, let her go! {\an2}This isn't that great. Just like every other year. {\an2}No wonder magic is becoming obsolete. {\an2}It's all because Holbrooke became principal. {\an2}Come on! Hang in there! {\an2}You'll be okay! {\an2}Akko is late. {\an2}She's practicing until the last minute. {\an2}Akko isn't here yet? It's almost time. {\an2}I bet she finally realized how pathetic she is. {\an2}And she went into hiding. {\an2}So she ran away without fulfilling her duty and left everything on you two. {\an2}Diana, it's almost time. {\an2}How pathetic. {\an2}I feel so sorry for you guys, to be paired up with someone like that. {\an2}Akko would never run away! {\an2}She always finishes what she believes in! {\an2}That's why she's practicing until the last minute! {\an2}Sure, she doesn't know when to quit, but that's Akko! {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse! {\an2}Now, for the main event! {\an2}Summonning magic by Diana, the executive committee chair! {\an2}I see. That's Diana Cavendish. {\an2}Let's see if she's a worthy heir to the prestigious family. {\an2}It's finally time! {\an2}-The star of the Luna Nova! -Yes. {\an2}We will perform water summoning magic, passed down from ancient times. {\an2}Shurial Muryuelle... {\an2}creature with the sacred mane... {\an2}receive the light from the stars. {\an2}Now come to life from the flowing fountain! {\an2}Tiphillie Lirullianae! {\an2}Amazing! {\an2}That's our Luna Nova star! {\an2}It sounds like Diana did really well. {\an2}It's Diana after all. {\an2}Sorry for making you wait! {\an2}Akko! {\an2}Jeez! You're late! {\an2}I'm sorry! I was busy practicing. {\an2}All right. Lotte! Sucy! {\an2}Let's give this everything we've got right now! {\an2}The festival is about to reach its end! {\an2}When the bell tolls at midnight, the sacrifice ceremony will be performed! {\an2}This year's sacrifices are Lotte Jansson, Sucy Manbavaran, {\an2}and Atsuko Kagari! {\an2}Akko. {\an2}Just watch. {\an2}Hello, everyone! {\an2}Let's begin the exciting sacrifice ceremony show! {\an2}-Exciting? -Sacrifice ceremony show? {\an2}Principal! {\an2}Vajarois the Grieving, come on out! {\an2}Akko! {\an2}Over here! {\an2}Oh, my! Is Akko the only sacrifice? {\an2}Metamorphie Fa-- {\an2}The poor sacrifice just became the Vajarois's latest victim! {\an2}What a surprise! She transformed into a mouse and avoided being a victim! {\an2}This has never happened before! {\an2}-The sacrifice has escaped! -How dare she! {\an2}There, there. {\an2}Come on, Vajarois! Come get me! {\an2}The stage is destroyed! Is Akko okay? {\an2}This is certainly different from last year. {\an2}It's getting interesting. {\an2}Akko turned into an elephant and she's flying now! {\an2}-How cute! -Principal! {\an2}I can't fly anymore! {\an2}Nice support! Now, I should join in. {\an2}What is it this time? {\an2}Mushrooms! Mushrooms are growing! {\an2}Thank you, Lotte, Sucy! {\an2}Akko, right behind you! {\an2}-All right! Lotte! Sucy! -No problem! {\an2}Hello, Vajarois! {\an2}Don't be so sad! Smile for once! {\an2}How vulgar! {\an2}Principal! {\an2}-What is that? -What a weird head! {\an2}Vajarois! Are you having fun yet? {\an2}Send away your sorrow with laughter! {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse! {\an2}Come on, Vajarois! Show me a smile! {\an2}Akko still can't transform completely. {\an2}But they're all laughing, so it's okay. {\an2}What's with this awful magic? {\an2}It's interesting, actually. {\an2}That's it, Akko! {\an2}How was it, Vajarois? Was it fun-- {\an2}Lotte! Sucy! {\an2}Vajarois doesn't seem like she's having fun at all. {\an2}Vajarois... {\an2}There it is! This is it! {\an2}I was worried that it was gone. {\an2}Turuto Estida! {\an2}Ancient spirit, answer my question. {\an2}What is Vajarois's curse? {\an2}This... is the Seed of Sadness? {\an2}After Princess Vajarois lost many of her friends, {\an2}she swallowed the Seed of Sadness so she wouldn't lose the memory of them. {\an2}The seed will spread its roots inside, {\an2}and keep the sadness for eternity. {\an2}So, what are we going to do? {\an2}Vajarois, why are you so sad? {\an2}Shiny Rod! {\an2}They were blown away by Vajarois's sneeze! {\an2}Akko! Akko! {\an2}You're Professor Ursula's familiar! {\an2}And you've got Shiny Rod, too! {\an2}Listen carefully, Akko. {\an2}The roots from the Seed of Sadness are spreading inside Vajarois. {\an2}The Seed of Sadness? {\an2}So she would never forget her friends, {\an2}she placed a curse on herself to remain sad forever. {\an2}You must pull out the roots of sadness! {\an2}Use Chariot's magic! I know you can do it! {\an2}Yes! {\an2}Where the heck is the source of sadness? {\an2}Hey, isn't that it? {\an2}What else could it be? {\an2}All right! Let's go, Lotte, Sucy! {\an2}Vajarois, remember the laughter! {\an2}Their smiles! {\an2}Arae Aryrha! {\an2}Ready? {\an2}What's this? Vajarois is acting strangely! {\an2}Akko. {\an2}What is going on inside Vajarois? {\an2}Vajarois... {\an2}your friends don't want you to live with sadness. {\an2}They want you to smile, Vajarois! {\an2}Open your mind! Let's laugh together! {\an2}Arae Aryrha! {\an2}That is Vajarois's true self. {\an2}This is incredible! {\an2}The sacrifice team has done something truly amazing! {\an2}They've done it! {\an2}They put on a really good performance. {\an2}It seems the sacrifice ceremony will no longer be needed. {\an2}Right. {\an2}You did it, Akko. {\an2}Lotte! Sucy! {\an2}This is all thanks to you two! {\an2}It was fun, Akko. {\an2}It was okay, I guess. {\an2}Diana! {\an2}It hasn't been announced yet, but you will for sure be the Moonlit Witch! {\an2}What about Akko and the others? {\an2}They broke the rules, so they're out of consideration. {\an2}But they put on a good show. {\an2}The award ceremony will start soon, so get ready! {\an2}Akko is crying! {\an2}She's emotional after releasing Vajarois from the curse! {\an2}Why am I feeling this way? {\an2}Translated by: Lana Sofer
