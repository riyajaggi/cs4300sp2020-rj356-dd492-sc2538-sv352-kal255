 Little Witch Academia (2017): Season 1, Episode 16 - Trials of Pohjola - full transcript 
 After learning from Ursula and the Shiny Rod that she needs to find something she is lacking in order to unlock the fourth word, Akko joins Lotte and Sucy as they visit Lotte's home in a remote Finnish village. The next morning, however, they discover that Lotte's parents and their neighbor have become infected with the rare Greenman Disease, which will gradually turn them into moss until they wither away. Needing five particular ingredients to make an antidote, the girls set off in search for them, but Akko's lack of patience proves to be an issue. When Lotte and Sucy also succumb to the disease, only Akko is left to get the remaining ingredients and is forced to learn patience in order to deal with a spooked reindeer and a yeti artisan who is lacking in self-confidence. Realizing the importance of being patient, Akko manages to unlock the Shiny Rod's fourth word and finish the antidote, restoring everyone to normal.

 {\an2}So, if Akko manages to revive the Seven Words, {\an2}then the seal to the world-altering magic will be broken. {\an2}It still doesn't quite feel real to me. {\an2}There are just four words left! {\an2}I'll spend as much time as it takes to find them! {\an2}What are you doing? {\an2}I was gonna try and look up some info on the Internet. {\an2}Let's see."W-o-r-d. Word." {\an2}Why's this thing so slow? {\an2}You just said you'd spend as much time as it takes to find them. {\an2}Yeah, but this is Akko we're talking about.

 {\an2}Her being patient would be like seeing Santa. {\an2}Do you think this could be... {\an2}Professor Woodward! Please! Why won't you tell us what it is? {\an2}The word is... {\an2}something you will require in your everyday life. {\an2}A sign of maturity, as you live and grow. {\an2}I see! {\an2}The Rod is relaying a message to me. {\an2}The fourth word is very close by. {\an2}What? Is it really? Do you happen to know what it is? {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo. {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo? {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo. {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo.

 {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo! {\an2}Shouting it is not enough. {\an2}There appears to be something absent for its revival. {\an2}So, what's missing from it then? {\an2}The real question is what's missing from you. {\an2}You're saying there's something I'm lacking? {\an2}You're gonna have to be more specific than that. {\an2}Professor! If you know, then please tell me what it is! {\an2}Now, now... {\an2}It's like I said. {\an2}Before you are able to breathe life into the word, {\an2}you have to discover its true meaning within yourself. {\an2}Hey, Akko... {\an2}-about tomorrow... -Huh? What's that? {\an2}That's right, we were supposed to visit your folks tomorrow. {\an2}I invited Akko and Sucy to my hometown {\an2}to meet my parents and have a traditional dinner. {\an2}But if the word really is that close, {\an2}maybe you should just stay here so you can find it. {\an2}-You should go. -Huh? {\an2}It may not be close by in the traditional sense. {\an2}It could also refer to the idea of being "close to the heart." {\an2}With that in mind, {\an2}you just might be able to find what it is that you're seeking during this trip. {\an2}Let's fly straight to Lotte's house! {\an2}Yeah, we're not doing that. {\an2}After using the Leyline, {\an2}we'll take a train, and then transfer to a bus after that. {\an2}Breathing life into the word... {\an2}Something that's lacking... {\an2}How come Professor Ursula is so familiar with this stuff anyway? {\an2}She said that Chariot had taught her all about it {\an2}when she was still a student at Luna Nova. {\an2}Hi! {\an2}Melancholy. {\an2}Huh? {\an2}Vexation. {\an2}Increasing levels from 30 to 50. {\an2}Anger appears to have {\an2}the highest conversion quotient for this type of magic energy... {\an2}Noire Fuel Spirit. {\an2}What's the one thing that I'm lacking? {\an2}I can't figure it out. {\an2}I should be enjoying myself here in this cute little town, but... {\an2}I just can't stop thinking about it! {\an2}This here is my house. {\an2}I'm home! {\an2}I thought that you lived in a magic tool shop, Lotte. {\an2}Lotte! You're finally home! {\an2}Look at you! You've grown so much since I last saw you! {\an2}No, please stop, Dad! You're making me dizzy. {\an2}-Welcome to our home! -Thanks for having us. {\an2}You must be Akko! {\an2}And you're Sucy, right? {\an2}Lotte is always writing us about the two of you. Isn't that right, dear? {\an2}Well, don't let us keep you. I bet you're all starving! {\an2}Here it is! {\an2}Hapansilakka pie. {\an2}Every year at around this time, {\an2}our next-door neighbor Ms. Yanne bakes it for us. {\an2}Lotte, make sure to thank her tomorrow. {\an2}Right. {\an2}Thank you for this food! {\an2}Yummy! {\an2}It's got such a weird taste, I just want more! {\an2}Please, eat as many of them as you'd like! {\an2}I think I'll do just that. {\an2}You're not gonna eat that, Akko? {\an2}I'm... full! {\an2}You can have mine if you want, Sucy. {\an2}Can we get out now? {\an2}We only just got in here, though. {\an2}I know, but... {\an2}This is my first time being in a sauna. {\an2}I could get used to this. {\an2}You know, Lotte, I'm a little surprised, {\an2}considering your family's owned that store for several generations, {\an2}that it doesn't have a more classical feel to it. {\an2}Well, there's not as much use for magic tools out here, {\an2}so things ended up getting streamlined. {\an2}We're the only witches in this area, {\an2}so my mom's always stuck with the jobs {\an2}the villagers can't take care of themselves, {\an2}like warding off evil spirits. {\an2}It really seems to be tough times for witches everywhere. {\an2}I can't take it! {\an2}I'm getting out of this sauna! {\an2}Just stick it out. {\an2}Please, Lotte! {\an2}I don't even like staying in the bath for more than three minutes! {\an2}Sounds like a personal problem. {\an2}What's the matter? {\an2}Mom! {\an2}What's wrong? Talk to me! {\an2}Mom! {\an2}Lotte! {\an2}Dad! {\an2}Wake up! {\an2}No! {\an2}Ms. Yanne! {\an2}Hello! I wanted to say I absolutely loved your pies. {\an2}This really isn't the time for that, Sucy. {\an2}Why is all of this happening? {\an2}This is moss, isn't it? {\an8}Look. {\an2}"The proper method to prevent the infection of Greenman disease..." {\an2}What the heck is that anyway? {\an2}Sounds pretty cool actually. {\an2}Sucy! {\an2}"Greenman disease is a condition {\an2}which happens at most once every thousand years in this region. {\an8}In conjunction with the level of carbon dioxide emissions, {\an2}birth rate of the local herring, and the timing of pollen in the air, {\an2}an astrological placement creates the catalyst for the disease to be born {\an2}when a hapansilakka pie is baked at the perfect temperature." {\an2}Hapansilakka pie? {\an2}"Once the outbreak occurs, a local witch must prevent the spread of the infection." {\an8}Once you get infected, what happens then? {\an8}Your body slowly turns into moss, and eventually withers and dies. {\an8}That's horrible! {\an2}My mom and dad... {\an2}Both of them are... {\an2}Lotte's mom was supposed to be the one to prevent the infection, {\an2}but it got to her first. {\an2}Don't you worry! {\an2}We've got three witches right here! {\an2}Look! This is the antidote! {\an2}"Five items are needed in order to create the antidote. {\an2}One flake of snow that falls in pine woods. {\an2}A berry leaf that was blown off by the wind. {\an2}Droppings of a newborn reindeer raised by the Sami people, {\an2}green Amanita, and a medicine capsule made by a yeti." {\an2}Lotte, do you have these? {\an2}No, but I know where they are. {\an2}I'm fairly certain I know where we can get the green Amanita at least. {\an2}All right, Sucy, we'll trust you to get the Amanita. {\an2}I'm on it. {\an2}Good luck, Sucy! {\an2}First up, one flake of snow that falls in pine woods. {\an2}There's snow all over. {\an2}"It must fall naturally, or else it is rendered ineffectual." {\an2}Huh? {\an2}Oops. {\an2}Akko! {\an2}This is gonna take forever, though! {\an2}Next, a berry leaf blown off by the wind. {\an2}It has to happen naturally, okay? {\an2}You can't just go ahead and pull it off! {\an2}I hear ya. {\an2}-What did I say? -I couldn't help it! {\an2}Getting just two ingredients took so... {\an2}long! {\an2}This is terrible! {\an2}What... What's wrong, Lotte? {\an2}We need the droppings of a newborn reindeer raised by the Sami people, but... {\an2}Mr. Nicholas' house is gone. It used to be here. {\an2}Really? Did he move? {\an2}I mean, he's always been a bit of a nomad. {\an2}I wonder where he is now. {\an2}Doesn't he have a phone? {\an2}No, he doesn't. {\an2}He doesn't even get snail mail. {\an2}Then how do you get in contact with him? {\an2}Like this. {\an2}Mr. Nicholas! {\an2}Let's head back for now. {\an2}Maybe when we're all back at the house, I'll find another way of contacting him. {\an2}Is that... Sucy? {\an2}Sucy! Snap out of it, now! {\an2}It can't be. It's gotten to her, too. {\an2}Sucy! {\an2}Answer me, please! We need your help. {\an2}Come on, Sucy! {\an2}Don't leave us like this! {\an2}Akko. {\an2}Lotte! {\an2}You have to make the antidote... {\an2}before it's all too late. {\an2}No! {\an2}There's just two more ingredients! {\an2}I have to find that reindeer first. {\an2}Excuse me, I'm looking for a reindeer. {\an2}Could you help me out? {\an2}Reindeer has been sighted at two o'clock! {\an2}Wait up! {\an2}I promise I'm not going to hurt you! {\an2}Excuse me, sir. Are you Nicholas? {\an2}Are you a witch? {\an2}It isn't pretty, but I got the fourth ingredient. {\an8}The last one is the medicine capsule made by a yeti. {\an8}You're going to visit the yeti, are you? {\an2}You know where it is? {\an2}Indeed. He lives over at that mountain. {\an2}It's so far! {\an2}You can hitch a ride on this. {\an2}Thank you so much! {\an2}Everyone, just hold on a little longer. {\an2}Once I get that last ingredient... {\an2}I'll hurry back as soon as I can! {\an2}What? {\an2}Is this it? {\an2}Excuse me. {\an2}I'm wondering if you could help me find something. {\an2}Sorry to disturb you. {\an2}I really need a medicine capsule. {\an2}Can you make me one? {\an2}Really, is that true? {\an2}And you could start right away? {\an2}Thank goodness! {\an2}Then I'll finally have the antidote! {\an2}Hello? {\an2}You did say that you could make the capsule for me, didn't you? {\an2}Okay, fine! Be that way! {\an2}Please make it for me! {\an2}I begging you! {\an2}Done? {\an8}It doesn't seem quite right. {\an2}Look at the pattern on the edge there. {\an2}It's completely different. {\an2}Everything has to be done exactly right or else the antidote won't work, {\an2}so please remake it. {\an2}The color's a bit different there. {\an2}We need to do it again. {\an2}I think you put too many lines here. {\an2}Once more! {\an2}Come on! That is completely different! {\an2}We need to start from scratch! {\an2}Sit up and take this seriously! {\an2}You told me you'd make it. {\an2}You promised me you would. {\an2}If I don't get the capsule, I'm not gonna be able to make the antidote, {\an2}and things'll end horribly! {\an2}I don't have any time to waste! {\an2}If you couldn't do it, why didn't you say so? {\an2}You're a craftsman, aren't you? {\an2}You should take a little more pride in your work if you're gonna-- {\an2}Huh? {\an2}Wait a minute! {\an2}No! Come back! {\an2}I'm sorry. {\an2}I went way over the line. {\an2}"To the yeti. You are just the worst. {\an2}Your work is terrible. {\an2}Die in a fire." {\an2}You were reading comments on the Internet... {\an2}which made you insecure about your work. {\an2}Don't let those stupid online trolls get to you like that! {\an2}You're a brilliant crafts-yeti and have excellent taste. {\an2}I know you can make the capsule. {\an2}Of that... {\an2}I have no doubt! {\an2}You're bursting with talent! {\an2}Just brilliant! {\an2}It's done! {\an2}But... {\an2}it's a little big. {\an2}I guess it's fine. {\an2}I've gotta head back! {\an2}Mr. Yeti! {\an2}Thank you so much! {\an2}Where'd he go? {\an2}My ride's gone! {\an2}Man, what a day. {\an2}Gotta hurry... {\an2}Just a little bit longer now. {\an2}They're waiting for me. {\an2}Just give up, Akko. {\an2}You're making things too difficult for yourself. {\an2}Don't worry about it, okay? Somebody else will take care of it. {\an2}It's not like you're some big superhero or anything. {\an2}I guess you're right. {\an2}Akko! {\an2}Is that how you really feel? {\an2}It's painful... {\an2}and grueling... {\an2}even so... {\an2}I'll do it! {\an2}Is that... {\an2}You really were left out here all alone! {\an2}I'm so sorry, Miss! {\an2}You saved me! {\an2}Please! {\an2}We have to hurry! {\an2}You got it! {\an8}Thank you, Mr. Nicholas! {\an2}"Mix the ingredients until it turns a bright rainbow color. {\an2}It is now ready to cook. The mixture will start to harden right away, {\an2}so keep stirring the pot until the color changes." {\an2}That means I'm gonna need something to stir with. {\an2}I have to stick it out... {\an2}I will persevere! {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo. {\an2}There is something absent for its revival. {\an2}So, what's missing from it then? {\an2}The real question is what's missing from you. {\an2}I see now. {\an2}I know what it is! {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo. {\an2}In times like these, {\an2}patience is a virtue! {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo! {\an2}What just happened? {\an2}Am I... {\an2}Oh, my! {\an2}Yes... {\an2}You're all back! {\an2}You completed your journey, Akko! {\an2}It was all thanks to Lotte and Sucy! {\an2}We're the ones who should really be thanking you, Akko. {\an2}Nah. {\an2}So, now we only have three words left to find. {\an2}We're so close, I can almost taste it! {\an2}I'm sure it won't take very much time to find the rest at this rate. {\an2}Remember your lesson! {\an2}Did you forget? {\an2}Mayenab Dysheebudo. {\an2}That means... {\an2}That's right! {\an2}Patience is a virtue. {\an2}This'll take a while. {\an2}You might be right. {\an2}Translated by: Lana Sofer
