 {\an2}I wish there was something fun to do. {\an2}This place is so freakin' boring. {\an2}It's always rules, chores, and homework. {\an2}Tsk. {\an2}I should just go ahead and drop out of this stupid school. {\an2}-When? -Tomorrow. {\an2}You know... you said that yesterday. {\an2}Yeah, but I mean it this time. {\an2}Hmm? {\an2}Hey, what are you doing anyway? {\an2}I'm doing research on the Seven Words.

 {\an2}"The Seven Words"? That's all you talk about lately. {\an2}If I keep finding them, I can meet Chariot! {\an2}And with the Shiny Rod, I'm sure I'll find them all in no time! {\an2}Huh? {\an2}-Professor Ursula! -Hmm? {\an2}Something happened! {\an2}The fifth word. {\an2}It's related to old history and traditions. {\an2}-Is it really? -Oh... {\an2}-Yes. This word... -Professor Ursula! {\an2}When are you going to finish the data that I asked you about? {\an2}I'm sorry, ma'am! I'll do that now! {\an2}Quickly! The Cavendishes really need our help. {\an2}Sorry, Akko. We'll finish this later.

 {\an2}Back to work. {\an2}Did you catch that? I wonder what's going on with Diana. {\an2}Hey, just forget about her. {\an2}You wanna know about a little rumor I heard? {\an2}A legend about the Holy Grail's goin' around Blytonbury. {\an2}Wait, are you serious? {\an2}From what I've heard, {\an2}the Holy Grail is under really tight wraps at Appleton Academy. {\an2}Supposedly, it was used for some traditional ceremony a long time ago. {\an2}Oh, yeah, wasn't Appleton-- {\an2}A very prestigious school with a thousand years of history and tradition. {\an2}Professor Croix! {\an2}I'm sorry. {\an2}It actually wasn't my intention to eavesdrop. {\an2}I was quite surprised to overhear that you're looking for the Seven Words. {\an2}You know about the words, too, Professor? {\an2}Do you have any clues about the fifth one? It's totally got me stumped. {\an2}I'm afraid not. {\an2}Since I'm a modern magic researcher, I'm not familiar with ancient magic. {\an2}Aw, man... {\an2}But you know... {\an2}if you're able find all seven of the words, {\an2}it might just provide you with answers to why Chariot du Nord disappeared. {\an2}Well, probably. {\an2}So that just means we have to go! {\an2}-But Professor Ursula said... -Come on, let's just go already. {\an2}Hey! Wait a sec! {\an2}Careful, you two. {\an2}Appleton is quite famous for hating witches. {\an2}The legendary Holy Grail. {\an2}Whoa... {\an2}Amazing... {\an2}So this is the prestigious Appleton, huh? {\an2}We stick out like a sore thumb here. {\an2}We'll be in huge trouble if we get caught. {\an2}Metamorphie Vestesse! {\an2}If that happens, I'll take the blame and get expelled. {\an2}It's not a big deal. {\an2}Don't joke about stuff like that. {\an2}That was Andrew! {\an2}-Give me that. -Here. {\an2}Metamorphie Faciesse! {\an2}Squeak! {\an2}Oh. {\an2}His dad is Count What's-his-face, right? {\an2}All right! Let's start looking for the Holy Grail! {\an2}This place is freakin' enormous! {\an2}Where are they hiding it? {\an8}Their supporters are barbaric. {\an8}Our team is surely going to destroy their's in the next round. {\an2}Our country's honor is on the line with tonight's kickoff. {\an2}Regardless if it's soccer or politics, {\an2}we are going to silence their nation completely. {\an2}I've always thought that our prime minister was too soft of a leader. {\an2}Diplomacy is a joke. {\an2}What our country needs is... {\an2}Strong politics. {\an2}What a smart son I have. {\an2}Just like you, Dad. {\an2}Call me "Chairman" on these premises. {\an2}Yes, Chairman. {\an2}-Sorry about that. -Hmm? {\an2}Are you new? What class are you in? {\an2}Well... I kinda forgot. {\an2}-What is with your attitude? -What? {\an2}Don't you realize you're speaking to Louis Blackwell? {\an2}Am I supposed to know you or something? {\an2}Well, this is surprising. {\an2}I was certain every student at Appleton {\an2}would know to respect those with the Blackwell name. {\an2}My father is not only the defense minister, {\an2}but also the chairman of this school. {\an2}Is that so? {\an2}Then, please, accept my apologies, Mr. Blackwell! {\an2}Stop! {\an2}Why you... {\an2}Amanda, calm down! {\an2}Huh? What's in there? Show me. {\an2}Uh... Squeak. {\an2}A rat? There was still one here? {\an2}But we hired a familiar exterminator! {\an2}Familiar exterminator? {\an2}Rats work closely with witches as their familiars. {\an2}So in order to protect our academy from vile witches, {\an2}we eliminated every one of those vermin from the grounds. {\an2}This school sounds pretty awful. {\an2}-Squeak... -Give me that rat. {\an2}You must be crazy if you think I'm just gonna hand it over to you. {\an2}What's going on here? {\an2}He has a familiar. {\an2}Come on, seriously? {\an2}It looks like a normal rat a fox would be able to dispose of. {\an2}So I'll release it outside. {\an2}Do you have a problem with that? {\an2}What a jerk! {\an2}So... {\an2}to what do I owe this magical visit? {\an2}Why are you trying to cause trouble? {\an2}If we get caught, we can't look for the word! {\an2}Oh, just shut up. {\an2}Do you think I actually care about any of that stuff? {\an2}Why did you even come here, then? {\an2}'Cause I wanted to make a big splash before I left Luna Nova, duh. {\an2}Well, that's pretty selfish of you. {\an2}And your point is? {\an2}I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do. {\an2}Try it sometime. {\an2}Can you believe her? {\an2}So, I'm going to ask again. Just what are you doing here? {\an2}We're looking for the fifth word. {\an2}There are seven words total, {\an2}and if we find them all, then I know I'll finally be able to meet Chariot! {\an2}Are you still putting that witch on a pedestal? {\an2}Yeah, I am! {\an2}I wanna be a witch who inspires others, the same way she inspired me! {\an2}Even though no one's asking you to? {\an2}Well... I mean, I know no one's specifically asking... {\an2}Please, enlighten me. {\an2}If you're aware that no one cares, then why do you? {\an2}I do it because I wanna do it. {\an2}Don't you ever just do things? {\an2}I've told you, because I'm a member of the Hanbridge family, I have a reputation. {\an2}I'm expected to behave in a manner befitting a leader of this country. {\an2}I have to uphold my family's honor. {\an2}Yeah, you say all that, {\an2}but I bet none of it is actually what you want to do at all! {\an2}Life isn't about the things you want. {\an2}Everything in my life has been decided. {\an2}Nothing is decided. {\an2}No matter how many times I fail, this is what I've decided. {\an2}I'll make people laugh, smile, and feel excited just like Chariot did! {\an2}And what if you can't accomplish that? {\an2}I will! I won't give up until I do! {\an2}So please, tell me... {\an2}do you know anything about the Holy Grail? {\an2}Even if I did know, why would I tell you? {\an2}Do you actually think that I'd encourage a troublemaker... {\an2}like... you. {\an2}Huh? What's that? {\an2}Where are they going? {\an2}Is this... {\an2}It's the Holy Grail. Oh, wow! {\an2}I've gotta tell Amanda! {\an2}Justice. Good game. {\an2}Looks like Louis won again. {\an2}It seems that Lady Luck is on my side today. {\an2}Huh... {\an2}Lady Luck, please smile on me next. {\an2}Don't bother. She won't be swayed that easily. {\an2}Looks to me like you're more sneaky than lucky, hmm? {\an2}-What do you mean? -Oh, you know... {\an2}Hey, stop! {\an2}Oh, come on, Louis! {\an2}Just hold on! I can explain! {\an2}Your bluff was too obvious. {\an2}If you're gonna cheat, you've gotta be way smoother. {\an2}Why, you little... {\an2}Oh, you wanna fight? {\an2}That's a... {\an2}Oruihon Deance! {\an2}Huh? {\an2}Aw, man... {\an2}Pretty sure Akko still has my magic router. {\an2}You're a witch, aren't you? {\an2}That's why I've never seen you here before. {\an2}What the... {\an2}-Let go of me! -If she's a witch then that rat was too. {\an2}All right. This side, too! {\an2}Hey, this one's peeling off. {\an2}I've got a bad feeling... I just hope Amanda's okay. {\an2}-Okay. This way next. -Let's go. {\an2}Crap! They found out! Amanda! {\an2}Why did you come to Appleton? {\an2}That's fine. {\an2}Once we catch your rat friend, perhaps you'll have a little more to say. {\an2}Don't you dare get caught, Akko. {\an2}-Amanda! Are you okay? -Huh? {\an2}Don't worry, I'm coming! {\an2}You idiot! Stay back! {\an2}Squeak... {\an2}Why'd you even come to help me? {\an2}There's still a chance for us to get away! {\an2}We are going to have a witch trial. {\an2}The witch has been found guilty and the punishment is torture. {\an2}This isn't a trial at all, you idiot! {\an2}But that's where you're wrong. It's been this way for ages. {\an2}By the way... {\an2}missing something? {\an2}Oh, no! That's the-- {\an2}You found the Holy Grail? No way! {\an2}Is this important to witches? {\an2}Hmm... {\an2}Then I'll have to break it! {\an2}Stop it! {\an2}What's going on? {\an2}-Now I get it. -Just stay out of this, Andrew! {\an2}Louis... {\an2}your principles are none of my business, {\an2}but currently, you're acting uncivilized! {\an2}We're giving judgment to the witches who trespassed! {\an2}While it's true that they entered our grounds without permission... {\an2}giving them such a boorish punishment is reprehensible. {\an2}A true gentleman would resolve this in a proper fashion. {\an2}Well, fine then. It's been decided. {\an2}At this academy, when either side is unwilling to stand down in an argument, {\an2}we are permitted to engage in a duel under the watchful eye of the knight statue. {\an2}It's one of our earliest traditions. {\an2}If you win, I will release the rat and the Grail. {\an2}But if you lose, you are both sentenced to death and the Grail will be destroyed. {\an2}Amanda! {\an2}This might actually be a key to reviving the word! {\an2}Seriously? You sure about this? {\an2}What are you on about? {\an2}En garde! {\an2}We start when this coin lands. {\an2}That was close! {\an2}What the heck was that? {\an2}The coin didn't land! {\an2}I don't need to follow the rules fighting a witch! {\an2}-Amanda! -Just fall! {\an2}What's wrong? {\an2}Aren't you going to use your precious magic on me? {\an2}Like I'd even waste it on someone like you! {\an2}A witch who can't use magic is even worse than one who does! {\an2}Shut up. I don't have to explain myself to you! {\an2}This is the end! {\an2}I win. You lose. {\an2}You did it, Amanda! You're awesome! {\an2}So do you think we put on a good enough show for the word? {\an2}-Well... I don't know. -What? {\an2}Damn... {\an2}Do you really think you've won? {\an2}Hey! What the heck are you doing? {\an2}Say goodbye! {\an2}What the heck is that? {\an2}Huh? {\an2}What the... What happened? {\an2}Okay... {\an2}Is this stuff supposed to be word magic? {\an2}Someone help me! {\an2}What the heck is that? {\an2}There's no way this is the word! {\an2}What on earth is happening? {\an2}Don't ask me! The stupid Grail belongs to you guys! {\an2}You freakin' cheater! {\an2}If only I could use magic! {\an2}Crap! {\an2}Hey, watch out! {\an2}Oh, man... {\an2}Right on target! {\an2}Found it! {\an2}Andrew! {\an2}Amanda needs this! {\an2}-Amanda! -Here, catch! {\an2}Hey, thanks! You're in for it now. {\an2}Here! {\an2}Take this! {\an2}Really? Those things again? Whatever! {\an2}-You okay? -Yeah, sure... {\an2}Amanda! {\an2}I'm sorry about the Grail. {\an2}I don't think that thing was the word anyway. {\an2}I bet it was some demon sealed in the Holy Grail a long time ago. {\an2}Yeah? You think so? {\an2}-By the way... -Hmm? {\an2}I think we may have caused a little mess. {\an2}What is the meaning of this? {\an2}Father... {\an2}A witch? Did you do this? {\an2}Look at you, Louis! {\an2}What did that witch do to you? {\an2}Someone, seize her! {\an2}What's wrong? I said seize her! {\an2}-It's not her fault. -Hmm? {\an2}Andrew... {\an2}are you defending the witch? {\an2}Well, I'm listening. {\an2}If it wasn't her, then what happened to my son? {\an2}As I'm sure you know, she entered Appleton without permission. {\an2}And Louis tried to punish her for her actions, albeit a bit too harshly. {\an2}Instead, {\an2}I suggested that they settle their dispute here on this bridge. {\an2}So they fought a traditional Appleton duel. {\an2}At the end of the duel, she was victorious. {\an2}She must have managed to brainwash you. {\an2}-You're wrong, father. -Hmm? {\an2}Something came over me and I spiraled out of control. {\an2}I nearly died today... {\an2}but this girl saved my life. {\an2}All of this was my fault! {\an2}What? What's come over you? {\an2}I'll handle it from here. {\an2}You got what you came for, right? {\an2}-So go. -Hmm? {\an2}Uh, so... {\an2}thanks a lot for helping us today. {\an2}Also, I, uh... {\an2}You already accomplished your goal. {\an2}Go! {\an2}Hey, Akko, {\an2}I'm really sorry about all the trouble I caused for you today. {\an2}I didn't know you were capable of regret. {\an2}Sometimes. {\an2}Bet you had a lot of fun though, didn't you? {\an2}Sure did! {\an2}Things are never boring with you around. {\an2}I feel the same way being around you. {\an2}So don't quit school, okay? {\an2}Eh... I don't know about that. {\an2}But we need to go on more fun adventures together! {\an2}Like this? {\an2}What are you doing? {\an2}Case 622. Experiment complete. {\an2}Translated by: Lana Sofer
