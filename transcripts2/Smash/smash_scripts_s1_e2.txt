 Smash (2012–2013): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Callback - full transcript 
 Ivy and Karen learn that they are the final two auditionees standing for the role of Marilyn. After an excruciating four day delay, they learn that they are being called back for yet another audition instead of hearing the definitive news of if they got the part. In the lead up to that audition, Dennis, a dancer friend of Ivy's, acts as her unofficial spy in the enemy camp. And Karen makes a decision about her rehearsals that could jeopardize her relationship to Dev. Behind the scenes, Derek still believes Karen is the better candidate, as her freshness and inexperience will add the needed dimension into the role, while Tom is Ivy's biggest backer, believing she has the experience and vulnerability in her personality to carry off the part successfully. Julia is somewhat caught in the middle, she who wants to seem impartial. A personal move by one could sway the vote. Meanwhile, Julia and Frank receive some news about their adoption process which makes Frank reconsider, much to Julia and Leo's dismay. And Derek receives some news about Eileen's divorce proceedings which may jeopardize the work thus far on the Marilyn project.

What are you doing? You've got a three-top, and the guy at your front table wants more coffee. What? I'm sorry... what? Relax. I took care of it. But you are so not here. Still haven't heard? - No. - How long has it been? - Four days. - That's not so good. I know. I'm so stressed, I just wish they would call me. - Karen. - Ugh. Here ya go, hon. You're gonna get it. Thanks. It's Ivy's part. She has Marilyn's soul. She has her body. She looks like Marilyn. This girl feels like Marilyn. How do you know what she feels like? Okay, don't go there. Straight men are gonna go there. - This girl is hot. - They're both beautiful girls. But only one of them has the experience to do this. Well, that's the thing, tom. Experience is precisely what we're not looking for. That innocence, that freshness... It's very Marilyn. She has to have chops. - That girl has chops. - I agree. - What a great voice, huh? - Give me a break. Ivy has one of the best... Yes, Ivy also has an amazing voice. No one here is saying she doesn't. And she can act. And she can dance. And she has ten years of Broadway experience. Okay, look, we can't just keep going over and over and over - the same question! - No... He's right. I'm sorry... huh? What did you say? You are right, tom. You are absolutely right. I'm fighting this hard I can 'cause' kidding myself. I can't handle this over to a completely neophyte not withtout more information. - Can I help you? - I'm tom's assistant. I know who you are. Get me Joe Machota at CAA. You have to do another callback? It's Marilyn Monroe. It's the part of a lifetime. If I have to jump through a few hoops, so be it. - Are they seeing more people? - Just me and one other person. Somebody new. Karen something. They didn't see her do a dance audition, so they're calling her back for that. We're both getting called back for scene work, - but I don't have to dance. - It's classic. You put in ten years in the chorus, stop, please. I'm a wreck. I'm just pretending to be brave. - I'm scared to death. - So it's another callback. - You'll nail this one too. - I'd better! 'Cause I really don't wanna put on those feathers anymore. I'm so sick of going out on that stage looking like a demented duck. Tell me about it. [Laughter] Everyone, uh, gather round. The budget is almost ready. We'll have all the schedules printed and distributed both in hard copy and electronically by this afternoon, at which point the budget director - will be available for questions. - You got nothing else? Something we maybe could sell papers with? I apologize for our current lack of scandal. I know this makes your life boring and difficult. I'm sure someone will do something stupid or illegal soon. If I were you, I'd count on it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lunch date with a young lady who's significantly more attractive than you clowns. - You okay? - My agent called. They want another callback. I have to dance. Oh, well, you're a terrific da... The choreographer's gonna love you. - It's the director. - The director? He's the choreographer. Sometimes they do both, you know? Oh. This is the guy who had you come over to his apartment at 10:00 at night for a coaching session. Mm. You never said much about what happened that night. Well, because nothing happened. Come on. Birth certificates notarized and authenticated. Marriage certificate. 18 years? That's impressive. Unheard of in show business. Once the agency signs off on your application, it gets bundled with other applications, then we send it to Beijing, and it gets translated into mandarin. That should all take about three or four months, and then the waiting begins. Begins? We've been at this for ten months. Chinese bureaucracy is very thorough. Well, how much longer are we talking about? Well... two years? I know. The waiting is the hardest part. Hi. Sorry. There was police action on the subway. Right. Sorry. There was a police action on the subway. Yeah. So we've heard. - Hi. - Hi. This is our music composer tom levitt singing on the recording, who, by the way, makes a lovely Marilyn. [Upbeat Latin music] ♪ in this factory where dreams can come true ♪ ♪ are you ready to make someone new ♪ ♪ you're the team that must teach me to do ♪ ♪ the 20th century fox mambo ♪ - [music stops] - Okay. [Snaps] First move brings Norma Jeane into the cabal of groomers as they affect the transformation. It's a fast, tight spin. - Here. - [Whispers] Sorry. Good. Let's make ourselves a Marilyn. [Orchestra tuning up] ♪ ♪ [baton tapping] - You did what? - Josh called me, said they needed a couple people to help out with the dance call, - so I said yes. - You spied! Yes, I did. She showed up late and had to be shown the first combination three times. I talked to her on the break. She's from Iowa, and her name is Karen Cartwright. Marilyn's name was Norma Jeane Mortenson. Which would be why she changed it. [Cell phone chimes] It's half-hour. My sweet. If we put let me be your star here right after the DiMaggio duet, then the breakup number goes... Here? [Groans] You know, it takes longer to adopt a baby than it took to write West Side story? Wow. No. I did not know that. You know how many criminal checks they put you thorough before they'll let you write a musical? I'm guessing none, since we didn't have one? None is right! And let me tell you, there are a lot of people that should be stopped from writing musicals. [Laughing] I'm aware. You know what we should do? We should write a song for DiMaggio, Arthur Miller, and JFK to sing about what they look for in a wanan. Julia, we have to start thinking about structure. You can't build a musical by just writing songs. Maybe it's not so linear. We start with let me be your star. - You start with it. - Seriously. - I can see it I my head. - You don't think - it's the act break? - No. No. It's like this. The stage is black. She stands alone in a pool of light. She's just Norma Jeane. Behind her... Figures in shadow emerge. Young women, exactly like her. You're nothing. Your father left because he didn't want you. Your mother is crazy. Certifiably nuts. - Nobody wants you. - Nobody wants you. - Nobody wants you... - You're nothing.

Well we don't know that yet, do we? You know, Ellis, your help is fantastic, but... I kind of need to be more alone in this space with tom around the structure. Oh, of course. I just... I get so excited watching my idea just come to life. [Chuckles] Eh... yeah, you know, a lot of people think that something that is said in passing is the same thing as an idea, which isn't strictly true. I-I don't think anything, I... Totally understandable. But we're the ones that have to do all the work. And you are tom's assistant, which is what tom needs you to be... Right, tom? Absolutely. So maybe you can just give us a little room. I'll go pick up the dry cleaning. Terrific. He's a really good assistant. For the first time in my life, - my closets are organized. - Organizing closets. Hey, you know what? That would be a great idea for a musical too! Has anyone heard from Derek about how the work sessions are going? I haven't talked to him. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, again! Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, - five, six, and seven, eight. - Oh, again! Five, six, seven and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Concentrate, please! It's just it's pretty intense. Yeah, it's supposed to be. Look, the gesture goes all the way to the end of the fingertips, and then the chin comes up. Josh, show her the combination again, please. Hey. Sorry. We've been running a little late. That's all right. Oh, how is that? Oh, this one a actually really good about the Arthur Miller- Elia Kazan stuff. Not so good on the movies, but there's so much of that in some of the other ones, I don't really miss it. How many have you read? A lot. - And the movies? - [Laughs] All of them. Come on, clash by night? Even monkey business. [Both laugh] Listen, um... I really appreciate you doing this. I understand it's a lot to ask. You know, after the demo and the dance sequence, not to mention the two auditions. It's Marilyn. I didn't expect it to be simple. One, two, three, four, five, and... Come on in. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and one, two, three, four, five, and seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five... Okay, everyone, we're done. Let's call it a day. Karen. Come here. I'm sure you two would like to meet. Ivy Lynn, this is Karen Cartwright. - Oh, hi. - Oh, yeah, hi! So great to meet you. I love your scarf. Thanks. My mom gave it to me for my birthday. Oh... it's so cute. Okay. Well, I'll see you Wednesday. - Absolutely. - Bye. Um... - I hate him. - I thought you said - it was going well. - He's a psychopath. - Why? What's he doing? - He's messing with my head. He brought in the girl, the other girl up for the part, and he was like, [Accent] "Oh, hello, I'm sure you two - would like to meet each other." - He's a Brit? Of course he's a brit. I told you that. No, no, you didn't, actually. Well, it's not important. What's important is he's a creep. Well, get used to it. What is that supposed to mean? Well, it means there are a lot of guys out there with a lot of power, and they're hard to deal with, so you should get used to it. I don't wanna get used to it. Then you create your own suffering. I am not creating my own suffering. He is creating my suffering. Your British accent's terrible, by the way. - Marilyn's not British. - Yeah, well, good thing too. Hey, listen, we've been invited to dinner this Wednesday. - Who with? - One of the deputy mayors. - Ooh! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're thinking about promoting me, actually. Awesome! - Then you'll be powerful too. - Yeah. - And very hard to deal with. - Mm... [As Marilyn] Thank you ever so. Thank you ever so. Okay. That's a little spooky. She does this thing with her lips... The top lip doesn't move with the bottom one. [Breathy gasp] Thank you ever so. Okay, you're freaking me out. How are you doing that? [Breathy laugh] [Continues giggling] Stop it! [Both laughing] Hmm. Great. Yeah. Thank you, Rene. I'll... I'll get right on this. Bye. What was that? Umum... Meetings for our group start Friday. We need... To write a short letter to the birth mother of our child. Obviously, she'll never get it, because the babies are abandoned and our daughter, let's face it, isn't even born yet, but... Something they ask you to do to get people... Engaged in the process. Okay? What? What? I just... I just think we need to be more realistic about this. Meaning what? [Sighs] Their most conservative estimate... two years. I'll be 47 when that baby comes. Well, I mean... Which would make me 65 when she graduated High School. So what, you don't want to do this anymore? I'm sorry. - Well, that's just great. - Okay, first of all, you should not be eavesdropping. It's the only way I find anything out around here. - That is completely unfair. - Oh, yeah, you're just ready to tank the whole thing, - and I'm the one who sucks. - Let me. So I don't get a vote. - It's just over. - No one is saying that. He said it. Dad said it. Your father has been anxious about this for a long time, Leo. People say things when they're anxious. - Yeah, like, "I quit." - That's not what we're saying. Mom, we've been talking about this forever. Ever since I was a little kid, you told me I'd be getting a brother or sister. - We did say that. - You just told me I had to wait, and then you said... You said my sister is in China. She's waiting for us in China. And I believed you. Why wouldn't I believe you? You told me. She's waiting for us to come and get her. What is gonna happen to her if we don't go get her? - Good show. - Bye. Thank you. - Hmm. - Good night. I hope Derek's not too hideous. He's very professional. If he steps out of line, let me know? Ohh. My own Johnny Hyde. - Who's Johnny Hyde? - Marilyn's first agent. He adored her. He was very protective, and then he died tragically, and her career totally tanked. You don't know who Johnny Hyde is? I do. I just like listening to you talk about Marilyn. [Laughs] I would have just given it to you. I know. [Dinner music] Eileen. Hello, Jerry. Wow. You're Eileen rand. Wow. You are such a great producer. - Hi. I'm Lindsey Mullens. - We've met. - I don't think so. - I do. - You all right? - Absolutely. How's it going? Well, Ivy's terrific. She's a perfectionist. If I'm gonna sink $200,000, in this workshop, I need to know the girl can carry it. Too perfect I can live with. Yeah, she's trying too hard. What about the new girl? excellent. Green doesn't even beginning to it. Well, Marilyn was green at the beginning. You don't say. I don't know. Maybe neither of them's right for it. Maybe... Scarlett Johansson's movie'll fall through. Get it out of your head. We're not chasing stars on this one. We're casting Marilyn on Friday. Eileen, Derek. - Hi, Jordan. - Hey, Jordan. Can I borrow him a second? - Sure. - I'll be right back. - Not too long. - I know. Have I given you any indication that I have any interest in speaking with you ever again? Can I have a Manhattan? She'll have one too. So... Derek wills, huh? You managed to hang on to him after my fair lady fell through. Ryan has a vampire musical. Would you get out of my booth? I'm not giving you Bond 45 in the divorce, Jerry. What's this Marilyn thing I? - It's none of your business. - Where you getting the money? Why don't you go back to Mindy? Lindsey. I dot t care what her name is. Would you get out of my booth? Let me give you a little advice, Eileen. We were good partners because I knew the business, which allowed you to be the romantic. All this nonsense, theatre is art... You deluded yourself, and then you fell in love with the delusion. Marilyn, the musical? No one is gonna buy it. You're making a fool of yourself. Hey! Oh, dear. We're gonna have to find ourselves another restaurant. Okay. Okay, we're talking 20 the most experienced dancers and singers. And what are we gonna do for the other principals? They haven't even finished the end of the book yet. - We'll call you back, Bernie! - We'll call you back. I'm just gonna touch base with Julia and find out what's happening with the new pages. Hang on, Eileen, can we just take a minute to talk about the bigger picture of this? Nothing is bigger than Broadway. I'm aware. But what's the plan after the workshop? We... we give people a taste, and then what? We'll work on it for two or three years, and... No. Mostly what I see on Broadway's overworked. You know, I love the songs. I love the scenes they have. I love Marilyn. Why don't we just do it? - Okay. So... - So... We do a workshop, we try it out of town, we bring it to Broadway. Well, it's pretty fast. I love fast. Go get me a Marilyn. [Under breath] ♪ in this factory ♪ ♪ where dreams can come true ♪ are you ready to make someone new ♪ see? I was right. You're a terrific dancer. The rhythms are really complicated. - I can't remember this. - You have the address - of the restaurant, right? - Yeah. It's in my cell. I can't pick you up, you know. No, no, no, we rehearse till 7:00, so I'll just change at the rehearsal hall and come straight over. Don't worry. I know it's important. I'll be there. Go. You're making me nervous. Get out. What are you working on? Oh. You know, just stuff. [Light laugh] Listen... I wanna go back to work. - Oh... - I know. I know. It's been a while. But there's always a market for good science teachers... And I miss it. You miss the periodic table? I do, actually. Ha. And... I miss the kids. And what about the adoption? - Julia. - Hmm? I can't wait anymore. You have your writing. All I ha I is the waiting. Leo's gone all day. I need something. And... I'm a teacher. I'm a good teacher. Even though I never could get you to understand p orbitals. Well, that was because every time you'd start describing them, it was just so sexy, I'd get distracted. I'll see everyone at the callbacks on Friday. Thanks for your work. I appreciate it. Thank you. - There a problem? - Oh, no, no, no. - She's on her way. - I finally get to meet - the famous Karen. - I didn't know she was famous. Andrew says she's very attractive. That's why he wanted you to bring her. Klein has an eye for the ladies. [Chuckles] Look, I'm not gonna say that he doesn't, but fact is, Dev and I are the ones on the line tonight. Oh, hang on, miss Cartwright. I haven't finished with you yet. - Oh. - We would have done it earlier, but the dance took a little bit longer than it should have. You ready for me? Oh, yeah, come on in. Dave's gonna read with you. I'm sorry, is there a problem? - It's not gonna take very long. - No, no. Good. So you're the deputy press secretary. - Yes. Yes, sir. - He's doing an amazing job. He is much better with those animals in the press corps - than I ever was. - They can be quite a handful. You've just got to feed them properly... No red meat. Andrew says you're very dedicated. She coming? Oh, yeah, no. I'm sure she's on her way. 'Cause stability is important in this job. Even though none of you are ever home. [Andrew laughing] I think we should go ahead and order. Yeah. [Ahem] I don't like the way they look at you. I can't help the way they look at me, Joe. You love it. You love every bit of it. The way you walk, the way you sing, - the way you dress. - It's my job to look like this. Your job is to take care of me and our home. I gave up baseball. Why can't you give up movies? I want to, Joe. Do you need me to be doing more Marilyn? Sorry. It's hard to say what it needs, 'cause right now you're not doing anything. Dave, move. Look, Karen... You have a lot of what makes Marilyn Marilyn essentially in you, okay? So just play the action. You wanna please him. You wanna make him happy. It terrifies you that he's this unhappy. So don't do her. Just be her, okay? Okay. Okay, let's try again. [Phone vibrating] Where were you? Rehearsal went late. I've been texting you for hours. I know, I... It was mortifying. I'm sorry. I just don't understand why you couldn't call or text. The last I heard from you was, "I'm on my way." I was worried about you the whole dinner. - I couldn't focus. - I couldn't get out. You couldn't even say, sorry, I need a minute? I have to text my boyfriend who I'm standing up! This brilliant, powerful director is that powerful that you couldn't even ask the question? I got confused. There wasn't the right moment. I'm sorry. Dev! I'm really sorry. I'm not crazy. People wanna think that. They say I'm crazy... [Exhales] I'm sorry. No, no. It's difficult. Well, the DiMaggio scene is less internal. Quite a bit. It's just that word, crazy, it... Just feels so volatile. She was so afraid her whole life that she'd end up being crazy like her mother. Yeah. That's definitely in there. [Exhales] [Exhales] I'm not crazy. People want to think that. They say I'm crazy because I want things, but the things I want... I want love. I don't want... Well... A sex object is a thing. Who would want to be a thing? Okay, hang on. May I? - Hey, Dennis. - Hi. - Hey, Ivy. - Hi. - Oh... - You look fantastic. Ha. I'm fine. I'm good. You're gonna be great. Ivy. [Gasps] Hi, hi, hi! Mmm! [Giggles] You look stunning. Doesn't she? Look at that top. Perfect choice, of course. Sit, sit, sit. Thank you so much for doing this. Oh. I'm thrilled you've given me the chance. Well, hopefully, we won't be torturing you for too much longer. It is nerve-wracking. Everything feels so important the first time. Doesn't it feel that way every time? Yes. It does feel that way every time. You're just a a little more used to it driving you crazy. [Footsteps] Yeah, just be you. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Come on, tom. - Okay! Have to go. So we'll start with the dance call and then move on to the scene work. Good for me. He hey. Just relax. You're great in this. Thanks. Oh, and guys, the song was so good, we just went ahead and staged the whole thing. Karen, let's take a look.

Nope. Information we have. I thought Karen's dancing was good. She might be green, but she's certainly trained. - She's a star. - Well, you can't say that until it happens, but it could happen, yes. Ivy was incredible. - She was. - I thought she was completely spontususus and sexy. Yes, she is that and more. She's intelligent, she's passionate. She's beautiful. I thought her reading of the new pages was pitch-perfect. Was it too perfect? Yeah, I dunno. There's a lonelys there, a wound that... Was heart-breaking, really. [Sighs] And Karen is more of an innocent, which is also good for Marilyn. So? They getting anywhere? Not yet. Any word yet? I'm about to crawl out of my skin. Oh... - Nothing yet? - Not a word. - This is awful. - I know. Night, you guys. Night. - You okay? - I don't want to talk about it. I can't believe it's going on like this. I don't want to talk about it. Ivy. Hi. I wanted to come and tell you in person. I didn't get it. God, I didn't get it. It's okay. It's okay, tom. I just have to get outta here. Ivy, stop! You got it. I got it? You're Marilyn. Oh, my God, I got it! [Laughter, chatter] Are you all right? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do! [Laughter] So you feel good about our choice? If I didn't, I wouldn't have gone along with it. She's a very talented young lady. - And lucky. - We're all lucky. And the Cartwright girl, maybe not so much. That's true. But I'd keep my eye on that one. Eileen, I need to talk to you about something. Yes? I, uh... I don't want it getting back to you in a bad way. Jerry's picked up the option on my fair lady. He did? Yeah. He wants me back on board. You know, I spent three years of my life on that production. - That's a lot of work - mm. So I, uh... Basically went ahead and told him to, uh, shove it. You did? Yeah. Call me crazy, but I kinda like Marilyn. She is not the American Eliza Doolittle at all. She's much more interesting than that. I certainly think so. It also helps you reasier on the eye than Jerry. See you tomorrow. [Sniffles] Whew. Hey, I just heard that it's a special night for one of our friends. Ivy Lynn just landed a big gig playing Marilyn Monroe in a new musical headed for Broadway. Come on, Ivy, how 'bout a song? Oh, no. [Chanting] Ivy, Ivy, Ivy, Ivy, Ivy! Okay. Would anyone else like to share their letter? I-I guess I can. "To the birth mother of my daughter. "Our lives are so far distant from each other, "it is as if neither of us exists. "I will never know you, "even though you may give birth to her, "my daughter may never know you as well. "But I want you to know I will guard her like a lion. "I will raise her with love, "I will protect her from the wounds of loneliness. "She will be a child of two lands, "and she will wear that knowledge with pride.
