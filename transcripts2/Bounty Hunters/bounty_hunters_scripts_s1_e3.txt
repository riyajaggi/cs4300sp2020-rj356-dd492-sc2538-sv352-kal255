 that I haven't been paid for yet. - What will my mother say? - She'll say you struck gold with this one. We just had a smashing catch up over some huevos. That's Puerto Rican for scrambled eggs. Darling, I've got to visit your father and Penelope still wants that table. Fine, I'll fetch it from the locker myself. - No, no, no, no, I'll make him do it, sweetie. - She's too good for you. Just drop that table at the Women's Institute. - The Women's Institute? What is that, a titty bar? - Titty bar? I told you he's a human trafficker. I seen a documentary on Fox. Where's our passports?

You look Jewish. - He definitely ain't Jewish! - Do you think I should burn my clothes? - Yes. - I didn't mean these clothes. I meant the ones that I was wearing at the crime scene. - Yeah, well those too. - Dad's done a runner from hospital. Mum's hysterical. - Right, I'm calling the police. - What? That's not fair, we don't know dad's side of things. - Well, I'll explain. - Barnaby, there's a corpse drenched in your DNA. You go to the cops, you're suspect number one. - B, remember what I told you about prison. With those blue eyes and baby soft skin you are, to use the technical term, bitch-nip. - Yes, I suppose that might be one of our pens. - Excuse me, you think that Jason Bourne over here killed somebody with a pen. - As I said, I'm not accusing anyone of murder. I want to know why the victim was in this shop. - Barnaby, you don't have to say anything without a lawyer. - I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm Barnaby's g-. - Old nanny. My old nanny. She's very protective. - Nanny, sure. He used to pee the bed, nightly. - Ma'am, Nigel Walker's laptop. - Sorry, I went on one chica website. - Okay, I wanna see a warrant. - Look, if you're hiding anything from me, it's just gonna make things worse. - Well, as I say, we really are only minding the shop whilst my dad is unwell. - Nigel! You look terrible. - I've just taken out my catheter in the lavatory of a Burger King. - We can hide them in the WI. The police won't look there. - You know, we need to vamoose these statues. We could sell them. - Nina, those statues have been stolen from some of the most vulnerable people in the world. - All right, all right, relax. Don't get all high horse and shit. - It's don't get on your high horse. It means. - I know what the fuck it means. How 'bout you keep an eye out for our tail. - Tail? - Yeah, go. Go, go, go. - Okay, yes. - Jeez, does this thing even have an accelerator. - It only does 40. - Turn. Don't indicate, we're tryin' to lose him. - Sorry, is it the police? - Do you hear a freakin' siren? Other way, other way. Stop indicating. - I'm sorry, it's a force of habit. - Van, van! - I'm gonna be sick. - Don't you dare. - Bugger, we're running out of battery. Come on. - Sidewalk. - What? - Sidewalk. - Pavement. If you're going to give me directions, you will have to do so in the Queen's English. - Shut the, move! - Excuse me, sorry! - Get the fuck outta the way. - Sorry. - Can you go faster? - It does go any faster. We're not gonna fit. Trusty old Gee Whiz. Good things come in small packages. - Yeah, you keep telling yourself that kid. Who the hell was that asshole? - We've got to find him. What if that man was after dad? Come on Nina, this is what you do. - What if your father wants to stay missing. - Well, how would you track down a? - Fugitive? Skip tracing. I would start with his parents. - Both dead thank god. What, they were dry! - Okay, well, then I would go to the spouse. - She has no idea. - Well then I would ask around. See if there was any, you know? Extra-marital. - No, he's not that type of man. - Are you serious, Barnaby? - Shut up, Leah. - Her name's Monica. She lives in Chelsea. - You got an address? - Sure, I threw a brick through her window last Halloween and the Halloween before that. Kind of a tradition. - Yeah. You're gonna sit this one out. - I'm sorry Barnaby, I thought you were just doing a mum. - What's that supposed to mean? - You know, pretending to be stupid. - You know, my sister ran away 15 years ago. She left me with Sofia, just walked out. Yeah, sure, I was messed up about it but. It taught me, you never really know a person. - I'm fine. - Good morning, Monica. My name is Detective Hall. - I ask my husband for a divorce. He refuses. Keeps me here in our townhouse like a dog. Nigel and I, we plan to start a new life together. Then he disappears. And yesterday comes here with a crazy story. Says he was attacked. I say by who? He says he can't remember. - So you didn't buy it. - Well, detective, for someone who said they had been in a coma, Nigel had a lot of energy. - So, he comes here, you. - Make love. - Yes. And he still wants to run away? - Yes. But I am afraid. My husband, he is a powerful man. - Right. Has Nigel contacted you since? - Yes, look. - Did he ever mention his family? - He had a daughter. - Any mention of a son? - I don't think that's relevant. - I think it's very relevant if you're shagging a man with a family. - Could you bring us some coffee please? It's been a very long day. Okay, quick, you're gonna text your dad from her phone, pretending to be her, asking to meet. - Why can't I just say it's me? - If he wanted to see you, he'd see you. - What do I put? - Keep it sexy. - You do it. - I don't have my reading glasses. - We have to talk. - No, that's too intimidating. Say, "I need you inside me." - Jesus Christ. I need to see you. - Do you take milk? - Yeah, sure! Yes, if you don't mind awfully. Darling. - I need you too. What do I put now. - Say that the house is being watched, where can we meet? - Catfishing my own dad. - Monica, did I say milk? Black please, I'm cutting down on dairy. - Meet me where our fate's aligned. What a creep. Remind me where that was. - Do you have any biscuits? I have very low blood sugar. - "Our eyes met my Rothcoe, our lips by Matisse, "and in the lift up to the bar", I'm not reading that. He's talking about the Tate Gallery. - There must be a lotta room in that elevator. - All men are the same, sweetheart. I bet your Nigel's at that Women's Institute tucking your grocery money down some tramp's panties. - God. It's probably those blasted electricity people again. They've been chasing us for weeks. Honestly, will it never end? - Leave it to me, sweetie. You gotta be a little assertive. - We want our money. - Goddamn it, we got no money. We can't pay you bozo! Deal with it! - My brother Keegan and I are not collectors. We are lovers. - Of art. But we do not believe in art at any price. - We were appalled to learn that the statue had been looted from Syria. What were we to do? We couldn't return it to a war zone? Therefore. - Every penny from this sale will go to charities dealing with the European migration crisis because this statue. Is a refugee too. - Smile, big smile. - Refugees sure do love a fleece. - I think they get given them. - Haven't they suffered enough? - Slippery bastards. If we stopped the sale by taking half a million quid away from refugees. - Well, seems Nigel Walker has two email accounts. - Why? - Looks like he's havin' an affair. - Good afternoon Madam, I'm Detective Inspector Suleiman. - More police. - I'm sorry? - Yes, I already speak to two detectives. A Hall and Oates. - This is a weird titty bar. - I'll be there in half an hour. - I can cope. Just concentrate on moving that stuff safely. - My bad! - Leah, what was that? - Nothing. - Leah, what's going on? - Barnaby, hi, wow. Well, I bet you're surprised to see me up and about. - Sit. - Actually, can't. I've gotta meet a client. - I sent those texts. - Right, okay. - I know what's going on. I don't approve of it but I need to understand it. Every single detail. - Well, I don't know what you've heard about Mediterranean women but it's all fairly vanilla. - I didn't mean her. I meant your business. The lock up. - Okay, all right. Look, a few years ago, some very important clients wanted to purchase a piece with less than palatable history so they asked me to massage a couple of documents. - You're a launderer. - Yeah, I mean. You forage the provenance of one dodgy Monet and the next thing you know, you're selling a Sheik Hitler's pajamas. - Jesus, what have you. - It's the game. They're not buying the piece. They're buying the story. - Those statues, they're not just a story dad. - Yes, I know, and it's thanks to me they're not smashed to bits by bloody terrorists. - Well, I'll be sure to inform the Pride of Britain Awards. - Barnaby, it would've all been fine but my clients got cold feet and they left me holdin' the baby. - Smith? - He's my link to the guys smuggling this stuff outta Syria. - Well, he's dead. - This is what they do. I wanted out and look what happened to me. - They tried to kill you? - I don't know, I can only assume so. I mean, I can't really remember very much. - Can't you just explain to them that none of this is your fault. - Nah, you don't understand. The men Smith worked for are not business men. They're not gangsters. They don't want big houses or flash cars. These men are soldiers. You can't bargain with them. You can't negotiate. They're fighting a holy war and God help anyone who gets in their way. - You need to go to the police. There is a detective, Suleiman, she'll understand. - No, no, no, she can't help me, no one can. Nope, they won't rest until I'm dead. - So you're just going to run away? - Yeah. - Were you going to tell mum? - I think it's better coming from you. - Asshole at six o'clock. - Who's that? - She's with me. - Move, move! - What? - Sofia! - Dad can't keep up. - Well, he's got to. - Barnaby. - Go! - Excuse me. - Get out the way, get out. - Excuse me. Would you mind standing to the right? - Move! - Out of the way. - Dad? - Sorry. - Follow me! Barnaby! - Where is he? - I don't know. - There, look. Dad! Dad! - Nigel Walker? I'm Detective Suleiman. - Come on! - God, what are we gonna do now? - I don't know what you're going to do but I am out. - What? - I don't want Jihads up my ass. - They're not up your ass. They're up my ass. - Barnaby, I like you, but you're not my priority. I got a family to look after. - Nina, I can't do this without you. - So then go to the cops, okay? Cooperate, your dad knew what he was doin' all right? He can do the time. - Please. - Sorry kid. You're on your own. - I guess you were right. You never really know a person. - Tati Nina, they took them. Some men came and then took them. - Sofia, where' ma? Where's ma? Answer it. - Hello? - We want our money. - But I gave it to Smith. It's them. - 50,000 pounds or the old women die. - Who are you callin' old - I promise you, I don't have it. We gave the money to Smith. We don't have it! - Wait. I took the money. - You sneaky bloody bitch. - I'm waiting. We want our money. - Couldn't we just give you the statue back? Do you have a returns policy? - They're not John Lewis. - Right. Look, they're worth a lot more than 50,000 anyway. One like it just sold at Sotherby's for half a million pounds. - So give us half a million pounds. - Jesus, Barnaby. - No, that's not what I meant. - You don't cooperate, you call the police, the women die. You have two days. - Listen to me, you camel-dick smoking whacko. I assume you don't have many women in your life so do you have any idea what menopause does to your sense of proportion? The shit I am going to do to you will make Sharia law look like spring fucking break. You! Hello? They hung up. - You took our money. - Yes, I took your money, okay? I had to get them outta New York, all right? Some people were comin' after them. - Who? Come on, who? Spit it out. - I shot a guy from a cartel. Ya happy? - Over the bloody moon. The cartel, wonderful. Anything else anyone's got to add? Maybe someone whacked a yardie? We could pop down to Chinatown, firebomb a casino, get the Triads involved as well. The more the merrier. - I was going to give you your money back. - Well, now I can relax because obviously you are a woman of your word. - Will you guys shut up? Now, I'd really like to see grandma again so how's about you stop bitchin' and start thinkin' about how you gonna get that money. - There's a Chinatown here?
