 Captain Larsen? It is usual to knock. We are sailing tonight, do we have a crew? What do you think you're looking at? Critic! This is an unusual way for a bride to arrive at her wedding. Daddy saving money? There isn't going to be a wedding Humphrey. Still haven't got over me sort of thing. I thought I saw this, they are caught in your melons. What the hell is wrong with you Mr. Hanssen?

 if you cannot handle your whiskey, you shouldn't drink it! Now get me my crew! I wish you weren't doing this. I am not marrying some idiot... ...my father has chosen for me. Just because his family is rich. - He is selling me is all. - He'll come after you Maud. Then the last place he'll think of looking for me... ...is on one of his damned ships. He's tough but he's fair. He pays one dollar a day. Wolf Larsen pays good money, he's a good Captain. Come on what are you afraid of? Wolf Larsen? The Ghost is a good ship!

 Someone named Louis O'Leary signed up for the Ghost runner? Yes. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph. - What's wrong? I'm Louis O'Leary. Why not, why not join up with The Ghost? I want a job as a cabin boy. You seen a lad come in here? No lad's been in here. Have they? You heard the man. Come on! Take him. Congratulations. You're on The Ghost. Why the sea Charley? Did I say the sea? Didn't I say "Get out of town"? Cause the sea is beautiful, Humphrey. The sea is wet and it's slimy and it goes on for far too long. - Like you. - What? What in God's name is she doing here? Doesn't her father own the Macedonia? All the more reason for her to stay away from it. Isn't she beautiful? All I did was criticise one lousy poem. One lousy poem? You said the whole book needed work. You and Maud Brewster were a disaster. Come on, I'll buy you a ticket. Are you sailing to Yokohama tonight? Who told you about the Macedonia? Does it matter? - A last minute decision. - I'm like that. - What draws you to Yokohama? - My writing. - If you pay me Miss... - Clark. Maud Clark. Miss Clark this is a working ship. Yokohama is only a refuelling stop. Real business is to go up North, kill a lot of seals. Nothing gets in the way of that. All I ask is passage out of here. Mr. Larsen sir, I'm the new cabin boy. You always come up on my good side. Why is that? There. That's much better. Don't you think? You've had a good few months at my expense haven't you? Your boss giving you a hard time? You're taking all our damn seals. Aren't you? What are you so afraid of Brewster? I'm not afraid of anyone. You should know that by now. Sailing tonight? There'll be nothing left for you when we're done. Nothing. I'm glad I'm not sailing on that boat. It's not a boat Humphrey. They call it a schooner. A schooner Charlie is something out of which one drinks sherry. Aren't sailing ships beautiful! You think so Miss Clark? My brother's ship. But the Macedonia can outrun her and outlast her. Where is your brother headed, Captain Larsen? Same place as us. We'll get there first. Were you in love with Maud Brewster? A critic should never fall in love, Charley. It might effect his objectivity. I never knew you were that serious about her. Poets and women are always talking about love. Why? They are naturally passionate? No. It's simply another way of getting attention. You know, you come on like an intellectual tough Humphrey. - When really you're... - What? Soft centred? I'm really not. You felt something for Maud Brewster. You know you did. I need some air. Excuse me... ...is everything alright ma'am? - I said excuse me... - Get lost. - Let's go. - We can't... Man in the water! Starboard side! Where am I? You're on the Ghost sir. A sealing schooner bound for the Japanese coast. Fetch me a glass of water. There you go. Nice to have a gentleman on board, sir. I must see the captain. Damn you bloody insolence! Supposed to be the mate of this ship. Yonson! Revive this man Yonson. My name is Johnson sir. I didn't call you over here to correct my pronunciation. I called you up here to throw water at this drunken b.. d. He is supposed to be the mate of this ship! Why hasn't he come round? - I think he's dead sir. - Dead? Dead? Dead? Who gave you permission to die? Stupid b.. d. Dead. Damn your bloody insolence! If I had wanted a corpse I would have asked for one. I paid you twenty dollars advance! - Are you a preacher? - No I'm not. Sew him into a bag and tip him overboard. So what do you do? I am a gentleman. I mean I work. I, I, I do work. I shouldn't think you've ever done a day's work in your life. Johanssen! Congratulations. You are our new mate. Aye sir. Which means we are short a sailor. You! Go forrard as a boat puller. No. What did you just say. No. I won't go forrard. I won't be a boat puller. I never signed up for boat puller. I signed up for cabin boy. Did you? Has that altered your attitude to promotion? Now get forrard! - Private income was it? - I have an income. From your father was it? Dead men's legs? I use these hands Captain. I am a writer, I write criticism if you must know. - Not that I see that it has... - You work for a living here. You start now. Cabin boy. - Get into the galley with Cooky... - My name is Humphrey Van Weyden. I wish to be put ashore. How much? I don't think Daddy's money will buy you out of this I'm afraid. Now get below. "Hump." You can't do this Captain. Who says I can't? I don't seem to have any choice, do I? Sir. Sir. Get below. Come on ‘hump'. This is the future Miss Clark. Real beauty for you. Beauty is efficiency. Don't you think? And sailing ships aren't efficient? They're purely decorative. Like my brother. Then why do they call you Death? The American sailors call me Tod Larsen. In German Tod means death. My crew call me "Death" Larsen. Just so long as you don't try to live up to your name Captain. No I am a very gentle character, Miss Clark. I would not hurt a mouse. Or a lady. You know there's a poem. Death and the Maiden. Death meets the Maiden on the road. And he is very nice to her. Yeah but she dies just the same. Very good captain. What are you doing? None of your business. Strike the topsails. I need two men aloft. Come on. Said you could gawp at the crew? Oh god! Oh god! You're belly aching, we're playing a game here. - You, you can't just... - Did you 'ear the captain? You ain't got no rights. Buy yourself some sea legs. Here, take these aft. Now! Come on! And watch the hatch. She's starting to roll a bit. Come on leave him alone. Come in. The Captain wanted to know if you wanted dinner Miss. Captain's table Miss. I'd be delighted. Harrison! - Let me hear a sir! - Sir! Up the rigging, lay aloft! Clear that line! What are you scared or something? I'll go. Thank you Yonson. But my mate gives orders on this vessel. Not you. Up you go. Up you go. He's too green. Did somebody speak? Watch your footing. - For the love of God! - Stay where you are! And keep the ship on course. You are not here to keep it steady for sailors who can't do their job. Sir. That's my boat puller you've got up there. He may be your boat puller, but he is my sailor. It is not right. He's just a boy. Do you want to argue about it Yonson? I think he'll be up there all day. To him his own life is so precious. Rubies. But to us it's nothing. It's not important. It is to me. Yonson. Unfortunately you are not important are you? And here we are. In our little, floating society. And I command. And you obey. It's absurd really. But you do. Because it's all you know how to do. Quit your whining boy! Seven hours he's been up there! There was once a great ruler who hired a poet to praise him. "If you do not make me sound truly wonderful!" he said to this man... ..."I will have you killed." And the man used wonderful words to describe his master. So the master said... ..."Beautiful! What is it makes you say such beautiful things?" "Fear," said the man. He moves! Fear has given him courage. He'll come down a different man. So. You are in search of something. Or running away from something perhaps. A little of both. You are a romantic, Miss Clark. I can't afford romance. Money is all that interests me. I want to hear all about your business Captain Larsen. About the seals and how you catch them. Could you pass me the... Excuse me... - How do you like our Captain Hump? - My name is Humphrey Van Weyden. - Not here it isn't. - Leave him alone. Christ! What are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? Take these ashes out. Have you been in my jacket? All my money's gone! - You've stolen money from my jack? - Hw dare you? You do as I tell you, or I'll give you another! Listen! Listen, Captain! - I've had enough of this! - What's that in your hand Hump? - Ashes. From the stove. - Sir. Sir. I suppose Cooky wanted you to chuck them overboard did he? - That's what I wanted to say... - I suppose you had better chuck'em. Not into the wind you moron! It's not fair! It's not fair! I've been taken against my will. I've been made to work on this hellish bloody craft. Have you indeed? Any other questions? Cook, stole my money. Get your lawyer on it. Clean my deck. The Bering Sea is closed to all sealers. The Russians shoot us if we get into their territorial waters. We can only take the seal in the open sea. Here. On these Northern Japanese islands. As they head up towards Siberia. I am in a race, Miss Clark. We get to the herd before my brother. If I lose it's all over for me. Why? I work for a real b.. d, Miss Clark. He owns me. That's all. And your brother? He works for himself. He's a free spirit. Wouldn't that be nice, Miss Clark? To be a free spirit? I think of myself as a free spirit. Do you? Is he older or younger than you, you're brother? What do you think? Older. What makes you say that? You sound as though he's in your way. How much did Cooky steal from you, Hump? 185 dollars. Sir. Sir. You've put his soul in danger. You shouldn't leave sums like that lying around. - It's not... - What? Fair. It's not fair. Of course not. But is it fair for you to live off the proceeds... ...of money you have never earned? Is life fair? Life is a mess. Like yeast. A ferment. A thing that moves and in the end ceases to move. I don't simply live off others. I work, I do work. I write. Well what do you write, Hump? I think I told you. Criticism. Doesn't sound like work to me. Do you believe in the soul Hump? You only have to look in someone's eyes to know there's a soul. "The eyes are the soul's window on the world..." Did you clean my cabin, Hump? No. No. We are talking about literature... ...so you do not have to call me sir. Is that the idea? Clean my cabin. Now! That's his navigation system. He's been working on it for years. I didn't hear you come in. You weren't meant to. Listen, don't rock the boat. Leave it alone. I wouldn't touch that desk if I were you. There's a wee drawer in it. And if you even look at it, he'll know. God knows what he keeps in it. - He's a terrible man, you think? - He reads. - He's not a pig. - He's a pig that reads. Listen, that new mate's a thug. He'll kill Johnson. Or Johnson will kill him. And I heard Wolf killed a man two trips ago. All we need to do is get there... ...get the seals and get the hell out, alright? Stop these dribs and drabs of money you keep bringing in. I'll raise you Cooky. How much have you got? I got money, I got more money. I was born a gentleman's son. Mr. Mugridge. "O the blazing tropic night, when the wake's a welt of light... You read Kipling, Milton, Browning, Plato, Shakespeare... Good. I'm playing your new master at cards. Come on down. You can serve the drinks. I hope you haven't cheated, Mr. Mugridge. No sir. No. Of course not. You're a gentleman, aren't you? Pour the gentleman a drink Hump. 185 dollars. I'll see you. No! That's not right. Listen, that's impossible. I saw, look... Take him up on deck Hump. No, no, no, that's not right. Listen I... Tell Leach to give him a soaking. That's my life's savings there I was born a gentleman's son. Captain said to give him a soaking. Oh my pleasure. Alright Cooky! This is for your mashed potatoes! - That's mine. - You are improving Hump. It's exactly the amount he stole from me. The amount may be the same. But now it's mine. Those are the basics. What is a kingdom but a great piece of highway robbery. You don't believe in justice. What is justice? A word people use to get what they want. - It's an idea. - Precisely. Look at you Hump. A living proof of the futility of all ideas. Take you out of your vivarium and what are your ideas? Nothing. You are fascinated by ideas. Am I? Look at your bookshelf. Well we were talking about justice were we not? And this is for your crawling, bullying ways. How's that? But people do not want justice. They want, as I have told you, to obey orders. Stand up. Sit down. Why? Who cares? So what is there? What is there to believe in? There is life Hump. The moon out there on the water. There is a beauty in that I suppose. No morality. Just animals snarling at other animals? I kill you! I'll get you for this. No! You won't! Society is about survival. Bout cutting up the person next to you so that you can live. Civilised society, whether it be a city... ...or a nation or a ship's crew will always... ...function more efficiently if everyone feels the mutual gain. But for that to happen, peace and justice must exist. Come on Hump. You miserable git. - In the galley sharpish. - I'm talking to this gentleman! He stays here with me. You cook on your own for a while. - Get out of here. - Yes sir. He didn't like that did he? I took his punching bag away from him. What are you looking for? You think there is some "secret" in there? Some faded picture of a girl who disappointed me? Some cliche that will explain me to you? I'm not to be explained Hump. What was your father like? A brutal b.. d. So of course we wanted to follow in his footsteps. And your brother? Everyone loves Wolf. Or rather used to. Do you find that's how it is with people Miss Clark? Once you know what they're like you want to kill the b.. ds. Why do you hate your brother? There's something wrong with the pressure. I think I can explain why you are what you are. How do you propose to do that? You are the product of certain things. We all are. The society you come from. Your background. Your family. Your family, something made you what you are. You're starting to bore me Hump. I think I'll send you back into the galley. Where you and your fine ideas belong. Come on. I am not to be explained, Hump. Any more than life itself is to be explained. Here's your lacky, Cooky. He's all yours. Get peeling spuds! When I'm ready! Strong isn't he? They say he can crush a raw potato in his hand. Just like that. Only I take it the potato isn't meant to stay intact. Is that the idea? What are you doing? I think I'm sharpening my knife, Hump. Is that what you're doing Mugridge? Well. Here's my knife. It's sharp enough all ready. Knife fight! Fight, wake up. Knife fight. Are we going to fight... ...or are you going to whet, whet, whet all morning? That's my boy! Nice and brutish! Have patience Cooky! Why can't we just shake hands and be friends Hump, please? I don't shake hands with scum. Three cheers for the literary critic! Welcome to the human zoo, Hump! You're all s.. ts. Poor Cooky, lost his bottle! Check the cylinder gasket. Is everything alright Captain? No Miss Clark. It's not. What's happening? We are about to lose the damned engines. I should ask you to get below, Miss Clark. Can you fix it? Get off my bridge, Miss Clark. Stay in your cabin. You have no idea what's at stake here. Come in. You wear a knife these days. I do sir. And Cooky trembles huh? Are you all right sir? Of course I'm alright. You haven't given up have you? - Given up what sir? - Trying to understand me. I was brought up to try and understand. And I was not. And to answer your unspoken question. I was raised in the far North. Among the peasants of the sea. There was no justice. You had to fight from the cradle. So there were other children? Of course there were other children. Aren't we curious? Don't you want to know how everything ticks? Do you think you can fix it if you understand it? Is that it Hump? Are you an engineer of souls and societies? - Tell me. - There is nothing to tell. Not about me and my brother. You think there is always something to tell. Sometimes there is nothing to tell. Your brother? Why did Cain hate Abel? There is no sense in any of it. Where is he? Where is that b.. d?! It was your job to keep the engines running! We're not safe here Miss. Really. Not safe. You do these ropes Yonson? I told you sir my name's Johnson. - I am an American... - Shut up. You think there is something wrong with these ropes? They are not new sir. It's dangerous. Well... ...you and I are going below to discuss... ...your grievances about the quality of ropes on this ship. Just do your job. I would rather not. And why not? Because I know what you and the mate will do to me sir. Would you be kind enough to join us Hump? I don't think I want to sir. Who will stand up for justice? And reason of the soul? If you don't come who will stand up for these all important things? Please, do come in. Now, this rope, Yonson. What do you say Mr. Johanssen? It is good rope sir. They're not new sir. You stand by that do you Yonson? That is the unalterable truth as far as you are concerned is it? Yes sir. Observe Hump. A great moment. Nobility in the balance. Here he is. Will he stand up for truth and justice and decency. If you want to know what I think... We do. At least I do. I think he is a brave man, noble... ...if you want to know. And are you "noble" Hump? Are you going to stand up for the right? What do you think this "nobility" of yours is made of huh? Open the door Hump. Enough. Two cheers for democracy Hump? This is how we stand up for... ...freedom and decency and all of those important things. Isn't it? I told you to open the door. Ok give me your hand. Give me your hand. - Oh my God. - That's right, come on. Harrison! Get some cold water! Come on! Get a cloth, get a cloth, come on! Keep your eyes open. Look at me. You b.. d! You cruel arrogant, self-satisfied, odious b.. d! Come on over. Because I will not stop. You'll have to kill me to shut me up you b.. d. B.. d! Such langwidge! No! You quite enjoyed that didn't you, Hump? Cooky getting his! My arm! Oh by the way. You're promoted. Gentlemen! Our new chef de cuisine! Thank God for that! I think he'd have killed us all if... We are moving again Miss Clark! Who are you writing about? No one. I can usually tell. So, you're an expert on love then? I know what I like the look of. And I usually get her. Everything as it should be here? Mr. Johanssen? Have you seen the mate? No sir. Hump, come with me. Light the damn candle. He knows it was us who put the mate over. If we don't fight back he'll crush us. Now is our chance. All of us. Haven't you got any guts? Why do we just lie back and take it? Hump! - The old man wants you! - He's not here. I'm afraid he is. I'll shut his mouth before he squeals. Wait! Hump's alright. He's got more guts than you. - Let's take the b.. d now! - Leach! You need this fight, but we don't. He's ready. He's armed. He'll be waiting for us. What then? What do we do? We do what... ...we do what people in our situation always do. We wait for the right moment. Which is never. Listen. the old man might be a b.. d but he makes us good money. I just want to finish this bloody trip. It'll be me and Johnson who get the punishment. Come on Hump! We seem to be short of a mate. The job is yours. $75 a month. I know absolutely nothing about sailing. Is that a problem? Absolutely not. And you will be called Mr. Van Weyden. No they don't respect me. The crew, they'll beat me. I can't do it. Of course you can. Trust me. I trust you. I won't do it. I think you'll find you will, Hump. Well done. Good night Mr. Van Weyden. Good night Mr. Larsen. We will take in water here Mr. Van Weyden. Aye sir. I leave the ship in to your capable hands, Mr. Van Weyden. Get the foc'sles down. - Helm two spokes to port. - Aye sir. Are we going in a little fast don't you think Mr. Van Weyden? Get 'em in the throat halyards and lower the gaff if you please. Let's get someone on the chain. Stand by to lower the boats, gentlemen! Something funny Mr. Henderson? Yes, sir. Get off my deck. Thank you Mr Van Weyden, that will do very nicely. Come in. You wanted to see me? Recognize this? Can't say that I do sir. If you intend to kill someone Leach... ...you should do it. You shouldn't half do it. It's not that important dying. Is it? I will decide when it's finished, Leach. Sir. Mr. Van Weyden. There they are. That's what we have come all the way for. What we will do for ladies' fashions eh? There's a lot of money to be made out there. Tell the crew to get ready to lower the boats. I want it done quickly - There's a storm coming. - Yes sir. Stand by to lower the boats. It looks like we have beaten my brother. Yes. Miss Clark I've come to inform you. We won't be putting in at Yokohama. - Well when will we get there? - I can't say. We might refuel on the way back in a few months. A few months? What am I supposed to do? Swim there? Well that's up to you. I am paying you to do a job, Captain. I trusted your word. Miss Clark, as far as I'm concerned... ...you've told me nothing of your true intentions in Yokohama. I've no obligation to keep any such word. Fine Captain. I'll tell you who I am. I'm the daughter of the man who owns this ship... ...and I insist that you take me to Japan. That's very interesting. Bye Miss Brewster. You'll be coming back I take it Leach? Do I have a choice? Ask Mr. Henderson. Alright, ease off on that a little sheet, fine. Start pulling her in, now Mr. Mugridge. Getting sentimental about our animal cousins Mr. Van Weyden? Even people who eat animals are... ...squeamish about killing them themselves. They should all be taken on tours of their local abattoirs. Animals have a certain dignity. The only thing I really like about them is... ...that they never use words like "dignity!" Let it go. Let's go. Did he tell you who I am? He didn't tell me anything Miss. He never tells anyone anything. Trust me, I don't want to know. He's evil. Pure evil. What did he say? He told me to kill you and drop you overboard when it's dark. It'll be dark soon. They 'ave to get their animals sir. There's no hunting at night Cooky. I want them back before the weather hits. What are you going to do? I can feel it brewing. What if it hits while they are all out? What then? We are lost. We are only three men who can handle the ship. You me and Mugridge. What do you say Mr. Van Weyden? I am sure we'll manage sir. When you came aboard this ship you were a pathetic character. Now look at you. Mr. Van Weyden. You see. She's starting. Just a little flap of the wind. Where is the justice in that I wonder? Being as there is only three of us sir, I don't think that we can... Mr. Van Weyden... ...stand by to jibe the headsails when the wind hits. Then set the topsails since we won't have long! Aye aye sir. Don't panic Cooky, I'll take care of you. Get ready to jibe, now! Cooky let go that foreboom tackle and pass it across... ...or I will skin you alive! We'll pick them out of the eye of the storm! Well done Mr. Van Weyden. Thank you sir. This beats whiskey gentlemen! Are you going to kill me Johnny? No Miss. I'm not. But I've got to get you off this ship for morning. There's a spare boat on the stern deck. I'll put you in that. It's the best I can do. - You might make Yokohama. - In this weather? Mr. Van Weyden, do you see any of our boats? I see nothing. I can't see anything. There's the Ghost, there's the Ghost! There are our boats! Over there! I'll go in past the first. - Throw down the lines to them! - Yes sir! Mugridge give me a hand with these ropes now. Mugridge! - I'm not going to make it am I? - I swear to you Miss... ...if he finds you on this ship alive he will kill you. And me too. This is your only chance I swear it. She's seen us lads. She's seen us. Mugridge, give me a hand. We don't have long. Get the rope. Here she is boys, she's coming round. - Make sure we get all the boats. - Sir. And everyone on board. I want everybody dry and warm within the hour. There is work to be done on deck. Close that hatch! Congratulations, Mr. Van Weyden. How many men have we lost? Two of them, Standers and Latermer I think. And Henderson but he doesn't really count does he? What did you do to him? He fell overboard in the storm sir. Wasn't it good? When the sea was running. Well now Cooky's alive. Most of his ribs are broken. You better put a bandage on him. - Tell him it is character building. - Sir. Are they up to anything? Is he up to anything? As mate I am sure you will keep me informed... ...Mr. Van Weyden. Naturally sir. Pass it around. Bearings to Yokohama. Just go. He'll kill you otherwise. In the sea for some time ey? What ground's my brother hunting first? Where? North west of Yokohama. I can show you on the chart. Set course for west of Yokohama now. Mr. Van Weyden! - Mr. Van Weyden! - Sir! Leach and Johnson are missing. Somebody's been writing out bearings for Yokohama.. Would you agree with me Mr. Van Weyden? Yes, Sir. I would. When I find the b.. d who gave this to them... ...I will rip him into little pieces. Trust me. Was it you Mr. Van Weyden? No sir. It wasn't. Well they are between here and Yokohama. We are going to comb every yard of sea. We are going to tack up and down until we find them. You hear me? You'll never make any money that way Captain. What did you say? There about Mr. Van Weyden, there about! This is us. Where's Wolf? He'd be about there. Towards the bearing sea. A boat Captain! Due South! A boat! We've got the b.. ds gentlemen! Hunters on deck. We have them in our sites. Give them a shot Horner. Let them know we mean business. What the hell are you doing? I've had enough. I've had enough. It's like he says. Am I a coward? Listen. You have something none of us lot have Mr. Van Weyden. You are smart. You're as smart as he is. We rely on you to get us out of this hell ship... ...and back home again one way or another. And I want to see my home again. Jesus Christ I do. I'm sorry Louis... ...I've had enough. What is that gun for Mr. Van Weyden? Have you decided to stand up for your principles at last? I am warning you Captain Larsen. I will do this. Leach and Johnson are good men sir. I'll do it, do you hear me? I will! Give him a shot Horner.
