 You're on the Ghost sir. A sealing schooner bound for the Japanese coast. I use these hands Captain. I am a writer, I write criticism if you must know. - Not that I see that that it has. - You work for a living here. You start now. Cabin boy. This is a working ship, Miss Clark. Real business is to go up North, kill a lot of seals. Nothing gets in the way of that. All I ask is passage out of here. Is it you want my soul again?

 Looking for the real me? What if I do not have a soul? Two cheers for democracy. This is how we stand up for... ...freedom and decency and all of those important things. You cruel arrogant, self-satisfed, odious b.. d! I'm the daughter of the man who owns this ship... ...and I insist that you take me to Japan. That's very interesting. If you intend to kill someone Leach, you should do it. You shouldn't half do it. We seem to be short ofa mate. The job is yours. No they don't respect me. The crew, they'll, they'll beat me.

 - I can't do it. - You will be called Mr. Van Weyden. This is us. Where's Wolf? He's evil. Pure evil. What did he say? He told me to kill you and drop you overboard when it's dark. Leach and Johnson are missing. Somebody's been writing bearings. When l find the b.. d who gave this to them... ...I will rip him into little pieces. - Was it you Mr Van Weyden? - No sir. It wasn't. I'll do it, do you hear me, I will! You haven't got the nerve. Jesus Christ, it's a woman in that boat. Welcome aboard Ma'am. Never seen a woman before? Take her below into my cabin. And be back on deck in under a minute. How did you get here? How did you...? He picked me out of the sea too, but there's not much time. This captain, you saw him. He's... oh God Jesus help me. He's a kind of a monster. Picked you out of the sea from where? - Please, just listen to me. - Mr. Van Weyden. -45 seconds. - You must not say you know me. I know that's going to be difficult for you... ...but you must not reveal that you know me. I know him, Miss Brewster. I saw the way he looked at you. If he suspects that you and I... ...that there was ever anything between us... 20 seconds. Now, Mr. Van Weyden! What do you think that is? I can't see anything. Six degrees West of North. I'm sorry sir, I can't see a thing. "I see no ships." You would do Lord Nelson credit, Mr. Van Weyden. What are you going to do with... Little lady? Welcome her on board. I could do with some more interesting conversation. You have said almost all you have to say. Now, take another look and tell me exactly what you see. I do not like my crew lying to me. It looks... ...it looks very like... A whale? A boat, captain. Boat ho port side captain! Will you be setting out after them, sir? I imagine they would be glad to be picked out of the sea. Perhaps we shouldn't bother them. They did seem to find our company irksome. Hey, look, over there. - It's the Ghost. - You sure? I would know her from anywhere. What do we do now? What exactly do you propose to do to protect them? If you lay a finger on either of them I promise I will kill you. Well, let's shake hands on that I promise not to lay a finger on either of the little darlings. You believe in promises? I do. Justice is a skill. Like sailing a boat. I want to believe there's good in you. l really do. We will come up on them from the port side. Change heading and bring us up on that dory. We don't know where we are and the boat's leaking. We've got no choice, Leach. We've got to let them pick us up. We give in, you mean? Why should be give in to that b.. d? Would you rather die? I brought your luggage. Thank you. I couldn't believe it was you at first, but it is. It is. I'm not the same. Tell the captain to take us to the nearest port. No, I can't. Fine, I'll do it myself. I know you're the kind of person who does exactly... ...what they want, when they want to... ...but I really do advise against it. Wolf Larsen is an animal. - Wolf Larsen? - Wolf Larsen. - This boat's not strong enough. - Look, she's Ghost changing course. She's coming this way. Damn! What will he do? With him? You never know. Sir! Shall we take down sail, sir? Did I say I wanted that done? No, you didn't. Well, then I don't want it done. We are going in too fast. He's not going to stop. He's aiming at us. He's going to ram us. He's going to hit us on the side! Ah God! Bring the bow around. Oh for the love of God. Do you want to come aboard? I'm not sure that they do, Mr. Van Weyden. Drop the sail. What the hell? Sir, they've lost an oar. The boat's shipping water. They're helpless sir. We're going back for them, sir? I suppose we will have to. Eventually. We'll be around in a jiffy. We ought picking them up. We'll never survive out here with just one oar. l'll set the sail. We'll chase the Ghost. He's playing with us. I'm sure. Put the sack back over the hole, Leach. Kneel on it. Good day to you, Miss. Where's Captain Larsen? He's at what we sailors call the back of the boat, Miss. Take in the headsails, Mr. Van Weyden. I think he's talking to you. Take in the headsails. Take in the headsails, if you please. He's taking in the sails. He's waiting for us. I never thought I'd be glad to look that b.. d in the face. Come on, you can do it. Come on, boys! Come on, boys! - Come on! - Keep it moving. - You can do it. - Put your back into it. Come on, the wind's picking up. Come on, lads, you can do it. Captain Larsen? I see Mr. Van Weyden has told you all about me. I hope he was complimentary. You look as if I scared you to death, Miss... Clark. Maud Clark. Do I scare you to death? Who's afraid of death, Captain? Welcome aboard, Miss Clark. Come on, just in, you lazy b.. ds! I trust you're not going to ask me to take you to the nearest port? I wouldn't dream of such a thing. Mr. Van Weyden did. He saw us a kind of floating cab. But all of a sudden, he changed his mind and became a cabin boy. Hurry, boys! Give me a moment. Louis! Come on, lads! Put up all sail, Mr. Van Weyden. What's happening here, Captain? We playing catch as catch can. Like children who drift on the ocean. Mr. Van Weyden is wondering whether to disobey orders. But if you train people right, they will always obey orders. Huh, Mr. Van Weyden? Fast up, boys! Put your back into it! Tell the men to put up all sail, Mr. Van Weyden! Aren't you about to pick up those two men, Captain? Are we, Mr. Van Weyden? Put up all sail! Move! You see, it's just a boys' game. It's now we amuse ourselves at sea. But you will pick them up? You promised me you wouldn't hurt them. Have we met somewhere before, Miss Clark? Am I just your type? B.. d! B.. d! B.. d! We'll get you! We'll get you! B.. d! You are going to pick them up, aren't you, Captain? I must ask you to allow me to... ...sail my own ship, Miss Clark. What are you waiting for? Put up the topsail! How dare you! They'll die! You promised me! I promised you not to lay a finger on them. Well, I didn't. Do something! Don't just stand there, do something! Miss Clark is shouting at you, Mr. Van Weyden. Are you the kind of man... ...who likes women to do that to you? You b.. d! B.. d! B.. d! She has remarkably developed powers of self-expression. God, have mercy on their souls. I take it you haven't come to talk about poetry. No, I haven't. Have you come here to tell me to face the captain out... ...to stop putting up with him... ...to get myself killed maybe like an honourable man? l didn't come to tell you to get yourself killed. But you didn't try to stop him, did you? The only way to stop that man is to shoot him in the head. ls that what you want me to do? It isn't a question of courage. It might be a question of moral courage. Leach and Johnson had moral courage. Look where it got them. No, no, no. In order to make a moral point, you must be able to survive. Do you understand that? To survive this, we have to lie. You... ...you have to lie. - You have to make it seem as if... - As if what? As if I'm attracted to the caveman-type? I suppose it's not the most ridiculous notion. He's clearly attracted to you. You just have to play a palt the part of someone he thinks. What? You know what I mean. And do it well, because he's no fool. Do you make a habit of getting women... ...to fight your battles for you? Or does it give you pleasure to watch... ...a women make up to another man? Oh for God's sake! I'll do what you suggest, l'll do it very well. Why's that? Because I find him very attractive, not that it's any business of yours. Listen if it's poetry and it's rational then it's not poetry. It's as simple as that. This is cosy. Not at all, Captain. l've just realized who Mr. Van Weyden is. - Have you? - Only by reputation. I've read some of his criticism, and the funny thing is. I didn't like it, I found it bloodless. Cooky, what is this stew? It is stew, isn't it? Miss Clark! How charmed we all are to have your company! What did you say you did for a living? Or do you live off other people... -...like Mr. Van Weyden? - I write poetry. I don't think you'll find many takers here. I'll take some! Tell me Smoke... ...you and Horner are not used to the company of women, are you? There was a Mrs. Horner, God bless her. Strong woman. Survived the scurvy, but the gangrene got her in the end. So, Miss Clark, are you going to tell us what you were doing... ...in an open boat in the middle of the ocean? If you will tell me why you chose to wilfully... ...murder two members of your crew. It wasn't murder, Miss Clark. They chose to leave, I chose not to rescue them. Now they have to live with the consequences. What was the name of the ship you were on? I never pay attention to the names of ships, it's just a ship. There are very few ships in these waters. One of the belongs to my brother. You would not like to be on his ship, Miss Clark. And why is that? People say he is a bad character. But his brother. Have you ever known someone genuinely evil, Miss Clark? My father, I think. Your father. Why do you hate your father? I think he cares more for his business... ...than he does for the people around him. I think I have something in common with your father. I definitely love this ship more than the people on it. What business is he in? - He owns ships. - What kind of ships? Does it matter? Steamboats. Pleasure craft I think. I know very little about my father's affairs. Did Wolf do your face, captain? Is that it? Tell me about his hunting boats. How does he put them out? I want to know everything about the way he works. You see, we don't maybe talk as much as we should. Excuse me. Perhaps, Mr. Van Weyden... ...you had heard of Miss Clark and her work? I'm afraid I don't review poetry. There's far too much at stake. Is that so? Poets can be violent in defence of their work. We notice that. Up on deck, didn't we, Miss Clark? I fight tooth and nail for what I believe. I like that. Especially in a woman, I love that. Captain. Smoke likes that in a woman, don't you Smoke? I love that. In a woman. I love it. Get out! You're a very passionate person, aren't you? Unlike Mr. Van Weyden who's a milk and water rationalist. I'm a rationalist. I'm not sure what you mean by milk and water. I mean you don't quite have the courage of your convictions. I thought you had promised to kill me. I cannot see you fighting for poetry like your lady friend. Miss Clark is not my lady friend. We're here to catch seals. Not to pick delicate creatures out of the sea. Whisky, Hump? Mr. Van Weyden if you please, sir. Sorry. I used to call him Hump, Miss Clark. But he has earned the privilege of his full name. Thank you. So your father who owns ships... What is this? This is something I'm working on. A navigation system. This is a map of the sky here. All the stars. Plot the course here. Then put your eye to the glass, and you'll see how. All you need is one star... ...on a dirty night, to know exactly where you are. It's beautiful. How did you invent such a thing? It had to be invented. Are you alright? It's nothing. He gets headaches. I'm sorry. I believe you are. He's extraordinary. I can think of other words to describe him. But to live like that, wouldn't that he something? You're afraid of him? Yes, I am. And you should be too. Has this journey turned you into a man? Or have you just learned to do an impression of one? Mr. Van Weyden, trim the headsail! Come on, more speed! Come on! So, has he changed? Has my brother changed? From what? Wasn't he always a b.. d? Well, between us, he was the sensitive one. So what happened? Our father's death. Well, well I'm sorry. How did he die? Everyone has a weak spot. You just have to find it, that's all. He keeps something in his desk. Louis says. Is it to do with your father? Tell me again about the layout of his boats. - lt's a half circle, you say. - No, no, no, no. It's like this. In the shape of a trawl. Seals, seals, we've got seals. We're rich boys. Well, Miss Clark. Now they start killing animals. Perhaps you'd better go below. No. Thank you. Boat on the horizon! Mr. Van Weyden. You see her? My brother, I think. Unless it's a Russian steamer warning us off. Watch them. The herd is moving south west towards us. Put all our boats in the water. In a line between us and the seals. Let the Ghost drive them straight towards us. He may have found them, but I've got them. It's the Macedonia. It's the Macedonia. God damn it! It's his brother's boat. Sir, it's him. It's your brother. They're coming after our seals. The Macedonia, god damn pirates. Can you see what's happening? He's blocking us. We're driving the seals right into his path. - Beaters. - That's all we are. We were here first, those are our seals. We're gonna get you. See? Some of them are giving up already. They're screwed! You see, we've screwed them. Come on! Jesus Christ! So what now, Captain? The b.. d will have all our seals! There's moral outrage for you. Will a strong man like you let them get away with this? Hold her steady Mr. Van Weyden! What's the matter with you? There are no dreams in my life. All I'm thinking about is the fact that I'm going to lose... ...1500 dollars if I let this continue. What on earth are you doing? Being persuasive. What's going on? Your girlfriend might be a quite... ...useful person to go elephant shooting with. - Don't you thing, Mr. VAN WEYDEN? - Did I say she was my girlfriend? Maybe not. But you'cl like her to be. I see the way you look at her. I wish people would, not talk about me as if I wasn't here. I don't like or approve of Mr. Van Weyden... ...in any degree. The bullet went right through, I'm glad to say. I try and shoot to kill. It's quite something if you know how to do it. Huh, Mr. Van Weyden? The b.. d shot my men! All the guns on deck. The day is ours gentlemen. Get those men on board! We're heading for the fog bank. All the sail, all you can! All canvas up. Trim the foresail! Bring her off the wind! More speed! If he gets into the fog bank we'll lose him. Mr. Van Weyden. As soon as we're in the fog bank... ...we'll cut all sails and go about. We'll come out the way we went in... ...on my brother's port side. Ay, sir! - Sir, he'll ram us! - Nonsense! Keep shooting! Don't make it easy for them! - Trim the topsails! - Ay, Sir! Prepare to jibe! Prepare to jibe! Prepare to eat dust, gentlemen! Go into the fog bank directly on his course. Once we're in we'll lose him. But we'll feel him and he'll feel us. We'll ram him side on. Trim the headsails! One, two and three. I Want more speed! Come on! All the speed you can! - Muffle everything! - Muffle everything! All quiet! Mr. Van Weyden. Now, Louis, go up and wind, wind, subito. Keep your eyes open. Keep listening. Listen! They're going full smoke. Now, Mr. Van Weyden! I see no ships. How about that, gentlemen! Turn this bloody vessel around. We've lost him. She doesn't tum that easily, sir. Give it to me! Pass it round lads, pass it round. Who said sails would give way to steam? She is something isn't she? She is. Weren't you saying you knew her in San Francisco? Did I say that? I think we knew of one another. Please don't insult my intelligence Mr. Van Weyden. Miss Clark. Captain. Sit down! You're not drinking, Mr. Van Weyden. I prefer not. Why not? How about you Miss Clark? Would you like to celebrate with me? Of course! Perhaps we should go in my cabin. Why not? Miss Clark knows how to live. Do you know how to live Mr. Van Weyden? I've been trying to work you two out. In what way? About how well you knew each other in San Francisco. What if we did? You admit it? Why shouldn't I? It was Mr. Van Weyden who seemed anxious you should not know. Whereas you were not bothered. I don't know why he thought that. Perhaps he thought. I might be jealous. You would have no reason to be jealous. Mr. Van Weyden is no threat to you. That's true. We walked out together a couple of times back in San Francisco. We were, I suppose you could say we were part of the literary world. A friendship then? Perhaps Mr. Van Weyden would have... ...liked it to have been a little bit more. And so your friendship turned sour? Did it I wonder? Miss Brewster's running away from her father. Miss Brewster, not Clark? I'm sorry. What difference does it make. Why are you always stepping around him? Why am I? Your name is Brewster? My father is Sam Brewster. The one who owns your brother's boat. Well that's perfect. Why didn't you tell me? - He was... - Afraid. I was on the Macedonia. Your brother found out who I was and tried to have me killed. Sam Brewstel's daughter. Well, and you walked away from the man daddy had chosen. I didn't love him. Love... ...what does that word mean? It's only desire wanting something and getting it. Wanting and loving should be the same. Getting something should mean looking... ...after them, caring for them. Sentimentality. - He's losing it. - You think? I mean, we came here to kill seals... ...not his brother's bloody crew. Van Weyden and that woman have got to him. Come on boys, let's not be too hasty. He's weaker than I've ever seen him, it's true. We should. We should go to him and tell him he's losing it. I'd like to sort him. And that b.. d Van Weyden. We should though! We should sort out the captain for good and all. - We can't afford him. - Smoke is right. So, your father wanted you married and you wouldn't be forced? No. But women like the idea of being forced, no? How can you say that? I don't mean the actual forcing. I don't mean the hands of a man on you making you... ...do something against your will. - I mean... - The idea of it? Quite. The idea of it can be very attractive. All right then. What do we want boys? We've got to know what we want. We've got to go careful here. What do we want? We want to be treated right, dumb Irish b.. d. We came on this ship to make money. We'd be better off working for his brother. Just blow his head off! Well, you've come on, haven't you son? - Leave me alone! - Didn't I tell you to shut up? You want to live. You want to feel the wind in your face. You wanna feel existence unaltered by thinking or weighing up... ...this against that, or any of our morality. You don't want Hump. You want me. I saw it in your face the first time you came on board. - Just admit it. - No, no, no. I saw it. No, no. Jesus. Mr. Van Weyden. My head. We lock him in his cabin, OK? And the mate with him. Let's do it! - Get out of the way, drunk b.. d. - Leave me alone. Captain Larsen! Hey, what do you want? What do you want? - We want to see the captain. - The captain's resting. We have some things we need to say to the Captain. Say them to me. Say them to me. Trust me... ...trust me. This can wait until morning. Of course it can, Mr. Van Weyden. Come on fellows. Let's go. Off to bed now. Come on. Let's go, off to bed now. Go on. Get some sleep. The captain will see you in the morning. Let's go. Let's go, will you go no. you go now, upstairs. Get out. You're the one who told me to act as if I liked him. I suggest you just leave, OK? Mr. Van Weyden. Help me to bed. Why did you have to do that? Why? Why? Put a blanket over me. My eyes, I can't see. Well, you did it, Hump. What? You stood up to me you, little b.. d. I never thought you would. And that's good, is it Captain Larsen? Better than lying down and taking it, Mr. Van Weyden. I don't intend to do that anymore. What happens now? - I'm sorry. - We have to leave. We? Unless you want to stay and take care of him. Let's move, shall we? How long was I asleep for? Six hours or so. Sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for the way I've behaved. Was this the right thing to do? It was that or kill him. You should let me steer. I'm fine. You should get some sleep. Come here. Now, take the steering oar like this. If the sails fill and you can't hold it, you just let it go. See? Is this right? We heard you was resting, Captain. Maybe I was. Not been well sir? Been under the weather, sir? I'm fine now. It's nothing. Good. Thought you might like to know, Captain. Mr. Van Weyden has gone. We've looked all over the ship. So is the young lady. And there's a boat missing. Set sail on course for Yokohama! Did we come all this way to shoot seals, Captain Larsen? Or are we now trading in human skins? Now! Aye sir! To the main sail! Oh for God's sake! Give me that! We're going to go under. Give it to me. Are we still heading for? If we're lucky we'll meet another schooner. We will catch the b.. d and he will suffer. There she is. Get the men ready, we will board her. Boat, boat. Captain! What is it? A steamship. It's your brother, Sir! Sorry, asleep again. Don't worry. I managed to get that sail up again. Only trouble is, I haven't the faintest idea where we are. Extraordinary! Extraordinary? Am I extraordinary? Here we go, you see? Here we are in an open boat in the middle of the Pacific... ...and you are arguing about words. Arguments are arguments about words? Are they? You have absolutely no idea about what women feel or think, do you? I'm learning all the time. You have to be cast adrift with one... ...before you even get a sense of them. You're intolerable. You have no idea how intolerable. Women want to be made to feel alive. By wonderfully alive men. Like Captain Larsen. You're jealous. That's all. Like a child. You're jealous. Listen! Look! Land! He's gaining on us. Put up more sail! Get the rifles ready, come on! That won't be necessary Captain. What the hell do you mean by that? We're going to ask your brother to come aboard. - Who's bright idea was that? - Mine captain. Never forget old Cooky! - This is absurd. - It's a business decision Captain. Money. Like you always say. We'll catch a lot more seals with your brother. Right, signal the Macedonia, come on. Tell them to come aboard. You can come aboard! Come aboard! So what now? Oh, I build a house, of course. And hunt for food. And generally impress you with my masculinity. Well. Go on then. Impress me. Why did you do this to my brother? We thought as you can't stand the sight of him. What's between me and my brother is between me and my brother. Please. Sir? I woulcln't worry if I were you. I don't think he can see a foot in front of his face. Take him below. And now we can soak it now. - Captain, Sir. - Just get out. You keep something precious in your desk, I hear. Who told you this? Louis told Henderson. Henderson told me. Bet I know what it is. Four eyes Larsen. You can't kill me. I know all your weaknesses. I got a lot of beatings for you, didn't I? Dear old daddy. What else can you do with a cripple, eh? And you, you were such a fine specimen of a man, eh? Why do you keep all this stuff? You're sentimental. Load all the skins on to the Macedonia. We'll move over to her right now. What about him? Let's leave him on the ship. Blind captain, without a crew. He can smell his way to San Francisco. We have to cut off the small twigs and... All we need now is a roof. All we need? Well that's certainly an improvement on your critical work. You know, I don't think even as a critic... ...I was ever in a position to judge. I don't think I knew anything about anything. I don't think I started to live until now. Because of... Wolf Larsen, of course. Made a man out of a critic. Isn't that how you see it? I think you've improved beyond belief since I first knew you. I wouldn't presume to say why. Is that enough? Who's there? Who is it? Stay where you are! Stay down there for the duration! He's blind? He is, but he's still dangerous. He moves with complete confidence. He thinks he's locked me in the lazarette. He's been drifting a while. The sails are destroyed. But I think she can be repaired. His cabin was ransacked. I found this. I'm going to raise these sails and sail this ship out of here. Mr. Van Weyden. You came back. He's improving, isn't he, Miss Brewster? How did you know was here? I heard you breathing. What happened? Was it your brother? My brother. Why don't you let us help you? Don't go looking for the good in me Miss Brewster. He tried that already. It just isn't there I'm afraid. Maud! Maud! Let's go. This'll take some time. We'll come back tomorrow. None of us are going anywhere. Not today, not tomonow. This is still my ship. I don't need eyes to find my way about it. No-one is going to sail he without my permission. What do you feel for him? Same as you. - Pity. - Anything else? I don't know what to call it. I don't know what I feel for him. I don't know what I ever felt for him. It's not what I feel for you. I'll kill him! Humphrey! - Stop, stop, or I'll shoot you. - Humphrey don't! I swear to God I'll kill you. - Please Humprey! - I swear to God! I'll shoot. - Humphrey don't. Humphrey please! - I'll kill him! No Humphrey, stop! Listen to me! Listen to me! When we argued on the boat, you were always the reasonable one. That was the thing I thought I couldn't stand about you. Only now do I understand. It's the most wonderful, impressive thing about you. It is what... ...it's what I think I love about you. Please Humphrey. Please Humphrey. I still seem to be alive, Mr. Van Weyden. Where is she? - Close. - Yes. You're in love with her, aren't you? What would you know about love? Who are the children in that photograph? Not frightened of a blind man are you, Mr. Van Weyden? Stay here. Where do you think I'm going to go? Nowhere. Got it. Catch me! We've done it. Do you think she'll make it to San Francisco? I'm sure she will. We should check on him. He's gone. Lock yourself in. Don't worry. I'll deal with this. I may not be a great marksman. But in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king. It's over. We're sailing her home and you're coming with us. Maybe you are right. But you'll never sail her away. Never! It's a tumor. I think I have a tumor. It's over. I'm so tired. You're in pain. You won't be sailing anywhere. You b.. d! Leave us alone, you b.. d! When Death was born... ...my father didn't want to know him because he was a cripple. So I looked after him. Gave him all the love my father couldn't. One day he came with a knife to me. And for no reason he cut his face. Just like that. Then he said I did it. I don't think I ever denied it. He got all the love he wanted after that. People... ...what can you do with people? They make no sense at all. We should probably say something. What though? I don't know. B.. d! Do you ever get free of people? You can try. But they mark you, even in the smallest things. This is still his ship, you'll sail her the way he taught you. I'll try. I'll tell you one thing though, Maud. I intend to be a hell of a lot nicer to the crew.
