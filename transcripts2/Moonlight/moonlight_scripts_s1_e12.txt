 Previously on "Moonlight"... I saw Coraline last night. You look just like someone I used to know. Ex-girlfriend, maybe? Ex-wife. She's been lying to us. No! She's not a vampire. She's human. She has a cure. I came back for you. You have to tell me how. So why did you take Coraline's blood?

 Vampires like me might see this as a cure, but others might see it as a threat. You really hate being a vampire, don't you? You're bleeding. You got hit. It's not my blood. So, you're the paramedic on the scene? Yeah, that's correct. D.A. Lindsay was yearning for us. Josh. Josh. I'm OK. You're okay. He has no pulse. He's not breathing. Clear. I'm sorry. He's gone.

 I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am. You all right, Miss Turner? Yeah. Thanks for coming in. As I told you on the phone, we need signed statements from all the witnesses. I understand. If it's accurate, you can sign it. The paramedic said Mick St. John took some really heroic steps in trying to save Mr. Lindsey's life. You can save him. - No, I can't do that. - Yes, you can. Turn him. He'll live. It's not living. Save him. Please, for me. Please! Beth. Beth. Come on, Beth. This is ridiculous. I did everything possible to save him. You did everything humanly possible. I live every day regretting what I am. I'm not about to subject Josh or anyone else to that fate, okay? I'm trying really hard to understand, okay? Beth. I'll see you, okay? As vampires age, their scent becomes more potent from decay. I'm picking up on a lot of decay. Mick St. John. I don't think we know each other. That's true. We've never met before. I'm sure by now you've detected we're... Kindred souls. What's this about? We're hoping you'd help us find someone. Who might that be? We're looking for a vampire named Coraline. I don't know anyone named Coraline. Tall, dark hair, mysterious, incredibly sexy. She turned you. That was 50 years ago. We haven't been together for a long time. Why do you need her? She took something from me. And why should I help you? We'll be seeing you. Hey, your money's always good here. Newly turned vampires-- no matter how good they are, when you've been playing 200 years, it's hard to lose. Exclusive club membership-- each of them a pillar of vampire society. I didn't come here to play. Eight ball? Nine ball? Listen, a couple of medieval vampires showed up on my roof looking for Coraline-- something she took from them. The main guy--he seemed to know everything about me. And the other one? He just stood there like his indentured servant. There was something about these guys. It was like they were from a different time. And what did they look like? The talker was big. 6'1", 200 pounds, dark hair. I don't know. Strong, confident. Sounds like someone's got a crush, huh? Anything else? One of his eyes--it was jet black. He had this stone-cold stare. - Lance. - Lance? You know this guy? Yeah, of him. He's somewhat legendary. He's not like other vampires. How come I never heard of him? Because he doesn't need to blend in with society. He makes me look like a pauper. He lives under his own rules. That's the first time I've heard of him in decades. He never leaves europe. What do you think Coraline took? I don't know, but who cares, Mick? You look after yourself, huh? I'm telling you, you don't mess around with this guy. I figured the best place to start looking for Coraline was where she disappeared as Morgan Vincent. I'm Mick St. John. We spoke on the phone. Yeah. Come on in. I need to see the security footage pertaining to the disappearance of Morgan Vincent. Like I said, the footage has been reviewed. There's no sign of her. We got no idea how she got out, so... Maybe you could, uh, just humor me on this one. So what time she disappear? Last time the nurse checked, it was 10:25. 10:47, she was gone. The doctor. Two nurses. Nurse with a male patient. I mean, like I said, there's no sign of Miss Vincent in any of this, so... Freeze it there. It's just a nurse with an empty bed. Zoom in. No, further. Red can you zoom in on that right there? Are those fingers? Yeah, they are. Was she kidnapped? Or somebody helped her escape. - Can you give me the camera angle  from the other end of the hall? - Oh, yeah. Stop it there. Zoom in on her. Cynthia Davis. She was at our wedding-- closest thing to family Coraline said she had. She hated America, particularly despised L.A. But she loved Coraline. Not now, Mick. I'd just got to the bridge, man. All right, right. Logan is the vampire version of a slob. You ever leave here? Why leave when the milkman delivers to your doorstep? Check this out. Expert level. I'm playing my new coffin guitar, and I just activated... Star power. - That's excellent. - This game has a pretty decent collection of music tracks, but, uh, these solos are a bitch to play. Logan, I have a job for you. Would you like it? What do you need? I need you to locate a vampire for me. Her name is Cynthia Xavier Davis. She was in town a couple of days ago. I want to know if she's still here. If so, where is she, and anything else you can find. And she's not local, so look into hotels. What? I'll pay you. I accept cash or blood. Cash it is. While you're waiting, you can play if you want. No, I'm, uh, I'm good. Mick, you know I can't work with you hovering over me. Hello. Miss Turner? Clarence Brown from the D.A.'s office. Oh, please, call me "Beth". I'm--I'm so sorry I couldn't come down myself. Uh, where would you like this? Uh, just put it there. What is this? It's a government insurance policy. Josh named you his beneficiary. I know it's not a lot. The big bucks aren't in public service. It, uh... means a lot to me. You know, all of us admired him. I-I should go now. Let us know if you need anything else. This is Celeste. Hello? Hello? Who is the man? That was fast. What do you got? Your girl's been busy the last few years. Master's and phd, both in biochemistry. I hacked in and ran her credit cards. She's been flying back and forth between L.A. and Paris every couple weeks, and she's been importing some kind of agricultural products from France. The cure. And when she stays in town, she stays at the Hardwick hotel. And is she in town? Perfect. Give me her room number. - Oh, no go. - Okay. Keep digging. I need to know where those imports are being delivered. And everything else she's up to. The Metro. Can I help you? Yes, um, hi. I'm Joshua Lindsey's assistant. I would like to confirm his reservation for two tonight at 8:00. Confirmed for two. - Thank you. - You're welcome. This is guest services. Uh, our system is down, and I have these spare towels that Cynthia Davis requested. - Davis? - Yeah. Could you tell me what room she's in, please? Yes, just a minute. Mick. What a pleasant surprise. Cynthia. It's been a long time. Can I come in? Sure. Why not? I'd love to catch up. Taking a nap? Oh, you know, hotels don't come with freezers. Where's Coraline? I saw the tapes. I know you took her out of the hospital, but why? You make it sound like I kidnapped her. I was helping her. Really? Come on, Mick. A vamp in the hospital? Yeah, but she wasn't a vamp. She was human. So where is she now? Europe. She left the day after she got out of the hospital. Some things never change, do they? You're still lying for her? So she's in Europe. Why are you still in town? I'm running a business. That requires agricultural products from France? I supply restaurants. What do you know about this cure? Cure for what? For what we are. Don't tell you're still fighting who you are. As helpful as ever. Oh, I do try. Thanks, Cynthia. Anytime. I could tell she was lying. Cynthia wouldn't be in L.A. without Coraline. Logan, what do you got for me? Well, I found out where Cynthia is having the imports delivered. Great. Text me the information. This must be about the cure. Why isn't it working? I'm not sure. I extracted a cell from the compound. I cloned it, then injected it into the cell structure of a plant from the same phylum as the extinct species. You said it would work. Well, theoretically, it still should. I'm gonna have to try again. Every time we try, we use up some of the compound. She's a vampire again. Don't even think about it. You'll compromise the testing. Did you really think you'd get away with all this? Lance. We've tried all this already. We're getting close. No, it's not that simple. Let's be rational about this. Clearly, Lance wasn't interested in being rational. You're so irresponsible. What if there's another reign of terror, hmm? I want the compound, Coraline. Where is it? Who is this guy? Looks like once again, Coraline has pulled you into all her trouble. You really should have stayed out of this. I couldn't resist. Cleaner. Location, please? It's a lab... In a warehouse on Figueroa. 919 Figueroa? How did you know that? It's a hot spot. Hey, buddy. What's going on here? Mick. I thought that was you on the phone. You do this? No. But I, uh, thought I should be responsible and get a cleanup. You said this was a hot spot. What can you tell me? Come on, Mick. You know the system works because calls are anonymous. I didn't ask about who called. I asked about the cleanups. Well, they're not like this. They were newly turned vamps... Bagged and left in the alley out back. Not accidents? No. Okay. I gotta go. Thanks. It was good to see you, Mick. You know, there doesn't need to be a cleanup for you to give me a call. Reservation for Lindsey? Oh, yes. Your party's right over there. Right this way. Celeste? Yes? You were meeting Josh Lindsey here, right? Is--is Josh coming? No, he's not coming. How long has this been going on? How long has what been going on? You and Josh. Oh, you're the girlfriend. Beth? He told you about me? - Listen, Beth- - No. No, you listen. Josh is dead. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I... I... Beth, it isn't what you think. I've been meeting with Josh because I was resetting his grandmother's stone. I... He was planning on proposing. I'm a jeweler. I was helping him. He loved you so much. He was so excited about proposing. I'm sorry. No, I'm... I'm sorry. I was looking at his calendar, and I-- It's okay. Here. I don't believe this. You call me down here to talk. I get here, you're gettin' a massage. Well, you seem stressed. What better way to loosen up? Yeah, well, very tempting, but we need to talk in private. Easy there, babe. Okay. We're gonna have to finish this when I'm done talking. What did I tell you? You leave this guy alone. It's like he has superior genes. His hand caught on fire, then immediately healed. How is that possible? I don't know. Maybe you were hallucinating. - You said you were getting your ass kicked. - No. I saw it. He regenerated. What I want to know is, why now? Coraline turns up to me in human form dangling this cure in front of me. Now all of a sudden, she's a vampire again-- She's always messed with your head, and I've told you to stay out of it. Okay? You let the old vamps Duke this out. It's just like Coraline to fall in quicksand and bring you down with her. This is not just about Coraline. There is some kind of cure, Josef, and Coraline is my only link to it. I have to find her. I have to talk to her. Here we go again. I'm not alone. Second time today I've returned home to find someone waiting for me... Except this time, it's not a vampire. Look, I know I said I needed space. - I-I just, um--it's okay.  - It's okay. Come here. - You okay? - Yeah. Want to come in? But it turns out she was helping him reset his grandmother's stone for me. Josh was gonna propose to you? I'm so confused. I don't know if it makes this whole thing easier or harder. I think the thing I'm struggling with is that I don't know what my answer would have been. When you proposed, how did you know it was right? At the time, it just-- it just felt right. But-- Go ahead. I'm so glad you're okay. Coraline, where did you go? - I had to get away. - Excuse me. Beth? Beth! I-it's okay. I understand. I think Beth is starting to like me. She didn't stab me this time. You saved me back there. Yeah, well, I also burned you alive, so I guess that makes us even. I think it's about time you tell me what's going on. That man Lance is after me, and I need to get out of town. Come with me. I'm not going anywhere. I want you to tell me about Lance and what you took from him. Lance is from a very powerful, noble bloodline. So what does he want with you? Is this about the cure? Coraline, you're a vampire again, but you were human. I saw you. I smelled you. You ate food. I was human. So there is no real cure? The cure is mortal itself. It's only temporary. Well, what is it? Wh-where does it come from? It's an organic compound developed by a noble bloodline in the 18th century from local plants. In this noble bloodline, there were seven brothers, all turned by the same sire-- a cousin of King Louis XVI. MY BROTHERS A TOAST TO OUR SIRE... ... AND TO OUR BLOODLINE... You're telling me-- King Louis XVI and various members of his extended bloodline-- all vampires. There's much more to the french revolution than is written in history books. The existence of vampires was uncovered. They tried to execute us by hanging... But eventually realized that burning or decapitating was the only way to do it. Ultimately, the guillotine was the method of choice during the reign of terror. So the reign of terror was partially a mass purge of vampires. A vampire genocide. A suspected vampire's finger was burned, and if the finger blistered, he was mortal... But if the finger immediately turned to ash, they were staked... And then sent to the guillotine. The compound temporarily masked the characteristics of vampirism. It allowed those who took it to pass the test. TO IMMORTALITY And Lance is a member of this bloodline? He is. So that's how you got the cure? Where is it? I wanna see it. Here. I took it from Lance a year ago. How do I use it? How does it work? You put it into an open wound and let your body absorb it. Is there any chance that this cure could be intensified to be made permanent? That's what I've been trying to do, but I haven't been successful. What, you've been testing on vampires? Just rogues. It helps with the research, and they need to be put down anyway, so I'm just killing two bats with one stone, really. Don't leave me! Josh! I took your life. Let me... Let me give back what I can. I'll need a sharp knife and some gauze. And take off your jacket. Is this all that's left? No, there's more, but not much. It's hidden. - Here? - Yeah. That's good. It's not healing. This is how it works. It starts from the wound, and then it just spreads throughout your whole body. You could start over with your research, right? We could. You once told me you were giving me the greatest gift by turning me. That was a long time ago, Mick. Yeah, but what's happened? Why this sudden interest in becoming mortal? I wanted to feel life again. And maybe... Love can't exist without mortality. Mick, I really need to get out of here. I can feel it. Coraline, I feel warm. What? I don't smell anything. Hello, sister. There were seven siblings in this noble bloodline, but it wasn't seven brothers. It was six brothers... And one sister. You gave him the compound. You set me up? - Didn't you? - No. You did this to take away my powers and get me killed? No, no. Don't flatter yourself. I could've killed you when you were a vampire. This isn't about you. This is between me and my sister. You wanted to feel human again. Well, here you are. How does it feel, Mick? Ah, blood doesn't taste the same now, does it? Wait. I'll go with you. And I'll give you the rest. But you have to leave him out of this. Kneel. Kneel down. If you take me to him, you know what will happen. You've made your choices, sister. You chose to bring this ungrateful mortal into our bloodline without his consent and without our blessing, and now you've chosen to betray us with this compound. There will be consequences. Stabbing a vampire with a wooden stake is the equivalent of putting a human in shackles. I can see the terror in her eyes. It's not the fear of the stake but the fear of where Lance is taking her. Welcome to the family. I've waited to feel human for a long time, but I forgot how painful it can be. With Coraline and what's left of the cure gone, my blood is the only link I have left. First time in many years I could sleep in a bed. Too bad I don't have one. Still human. Still human. No matter how close we start to get, there's always been this eternal wall between us-- She, a mortal, and me, a vampire, but with everything that's happened, maybe there's hope that things could be different. Oh, my god. What-- what happened to your face? It's a long story that ended in a big fight. Coraline's gone. It's not meant to be. It never was. Yeah, I, uh... I kind of know how that feels. Wait a second. Are you human? For now, yeah. How does it feel? The pain... The sun... The mortality... It feels amazing. We're gathered to celebrate the life of Josh Lindsey, whose journey's come to an end. While the event that brought us all here together is nothing less than tragic, part of what makes life so invigorating is its finite nature. We're all mortal. Our time is limited. It's part of what allows us  to love and hurt, and in the end, inspires us to make the most of the time we're given.
