 Previously on "Moonlight"... I saw Coraline last night. You look just like someone I used to know. - Ex-Girlfriend, maybe? - Ex-Wife. Coraline is dead. You saw her die with your own eyes. I was kidnapped when I was 4. I don't remember much. But the man who rescued me-- He was fearless. As long as I was in his arms, I knew I was safe. I know who saved me when I was a little girl.

 I found my guardian angel. Memories can be fragile... Mick! Mick! Fleeting as a whisper one moment, Powerful as a scream the next. I got the proof. She's been lying to us, stalking us. Morgan is Coraline. - I know she is. - You know? I spent so long hiding from my past... Hi, Beth. Ignoring the whispers. How could you?

 This is not what you think. But I remember everything now. And the screams are the only thing I can hear. Hey. - I got your message. - Get in. You want to tell me what you're doing here? Get in. Ok. Does it seem healthy to you? Morgan is quite the exhibition here, isn't she? See? I got your attention. So tell me about her. Who? Your ex-wife. What do you want to know? Well, we got time, so why don't you start from the beginning? How did she become a vampire? Raline was turned in the early 1700s in France. - She was a courtesan. - Oh, she was a hooker. No, more like a friend of the court. - She's still got the moves. - Beth, that's not her. - Was the sex good? - You understand that, right? So you were on and off for, like, 33 years. Was it the sex that kept you coming back? What is this? She kidnapped me when I was 4-- Took me from my bed, terrorized me, almost killed me. Yeah, Coraline did that, Not the woman that you are currently stalking. You're sure, 100%? No room for doubt? Get down. Get down. Look, if that's the same woman who destroyed my childhood, I've gotta know. Are you telling me you can't understand that? All right. What do you want me to do? If Coraline reinvented herself as Morgan, there must be something she forgot to cover up, some piece of evidence left behind. You're the one who told me that her story checked out. On the surface. But now I want to dig deeper. You've got to keep her occupied. How am I supposed to do that? Just turn on the Mick St. John charm. What girl could resist? All right, listen to me. If Morgan is Coraline-- And I'm not saying she is-- if-- And she realizes that you suspect her, I don't know what she'll do. I'll be careful. But one way or another, I will finally find out the truth. We both will. Pretty. My wife Tina. I want you to follow her. I want to know where she goes and who she sees. So what makes you think she's cheating on you? I didn't say she was. I've been doing this job for a while now, Mr. Haggans. A man wants his wife followed, He thinks she's having an affair. Tina's my second wife, obviously much younger. I've given her financial stability, social status, and what I expect in return is fidelity. Lately, she's been distant, secretive. If she were an employee, I'd suspect that she was interviewing for another job. But she's not an employee. She's your wife. Principle's the same. I'm the C.E.O. of a forbes 500 company. If my trophy wife is stepping out, I want to know about it before my board of directors does, and I want someone with no ties to me to be looking into it. $25,000 now, Another $25,000 upon delivery Of all audio and photo surveillance. I know a photographer who will be perfect for this job. I hope he knows how to keep his mouth shut. You're the only person that knows about this. Anything shows up on the internet, I'll know who leaked it, And there will be severe consequences. Do I make myself clear? Crystal. She's leaving my office building on Bunker Hill today around 1:00 P.M. Just one more question, Mr. Haggans. You obviously don't trust your wife. Do you love her? I own her, Mr. St. John. That's all you need to know. I wasn't sure that you'd show up. Yeah, me either. You'll notice I chose a public place. You're buying, right? Yes, of course. Ready to order? I'm gonna have the Carpaccio plate With some french fries and, um, This Burgundy here-- The Roman?e-Conti Richbourg. Excellent choice. And for you, sir? Oh, nothing for me. I'm on a special diet. Yeah, you and everybody else in this town. Body image freaks. Okay, so if you're not here to break bread, Then what's this about? I want to apologize. I would think so. The other night, I was completely out of line. That's an understatement. There's absolutely no excuse for the way I acted. Now are you talking about when you ripped off my clothes or threw me to the ground or just generally scaring the crap out of me-- Which one? Pretty much all of the above. It's just you look so much... Like someone I know... Knew... a long time ago. If that's the way that you acted towards her, too, I gather it didn't end very well. No. No, it didn't. But I want to make it up to you. I have a surveillance case. I need a photographer. It's gonna be $10,000 for a couple of days' work. $10,000? Yeah. The Roman?e-Conti Richbourg. Apology accepted. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. French fry? No, thanks. You sure? Why don't you enjoy them for me? So what's this case about? Husband thinks his wife's having an affair. He wants proof before he confronts her. Sordid. You can't always judge. No, I meant that in a good way. About this, um, ex-girlfriend that I remind you so much of, what happened? Did she cheat on you or-- Ex-wife, actually, And, no, fidelity wasn't our problem. It was just a very complicated relationship. It's probably best if we leave it there. That sounds like a story. So do you want the job or not? Let me see-- $10,000 to follow people around and take picture of them having sex? I'm in. Digging into a person's background these days is pretty simple-- Google search here, credit check there... Morgan took the job. She'll be with me the rest of the day. But when the ground goes back More than 300 years... Journalism 101-- Begin at the beginning. Go back to where it all started. No! No! What's that? Oh, um, a Fleur-De-Lis. Did you know that french courtesans Were branded with them back in the 18th century? It's like a permanent scarlet letter. Oh, does this have something to do with Paris Hilton? Uh... no. Oh, then I don't care. Do you have a story you're working on? I do, actually. I'm off to do some research now. Bring me something sexy that I can lead with. Sex, betrayal, murder-- This one's got it all. Oh, she's pretty. But for 50 grand it'd up to be a new model. There's a lot of people around, lot of cell phones. That means a lot of interference. I'm gonna have to stay close if Haggans wants all this on tape. I'll keep moving and try to get clean shots. Okay. This is for you. Keep the line open. You let me know if you see anything that I don't, okay? This is so "Bourne Identity". I love it. Okay. Target entering plaza from northeast corner. I'm on her. I think we got something. I see him. ... we take a walk. What are they saying? There's too much interference. I'm gonna have to get closer. Ok. So I know you're going to the office tonight... Look don't worry. I've got it all worked out. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like we waited too long. No, baby, I told you. No one else knows. It's just us. How can you be sure that he doesn't know? What? Move. She sees you. Mick! What's matter? What is it? Nothing. I'm just being paranoid. You stay with ... .. shoulders ... I really should ... What are they saying? The microphone's not picking up anything. That was the money shot. All right, you go. Listen, when you go home, act natural... All right? If he finds out... I know... He'll kill us. Talk to you later. Mick, I got it. It's full frame, all he kiss. I'm amazing. What's your problem? We can go up to Haggans right now with this photo. It'll be, like, the easiest 10 grand ever. Yeah, I don't think we should do that. Why? I just heard tina say that Haggen's gonna kill her. I know you're going to the office tonight. But what about me? Look, don't worry. I've got it all worked out. You know, after the kiss I heard what Tina and Owen were saying. Wow, you were right about the interference. - Cell phones, traffic noise... - Don't worry. I've got it all worked out. - It's gonna take a while to sort this out. - No one else knows. It's just us. How can you be sure that he doesn't know? 'Cause I know him. No, that's not it. It was right around here. Talk to you later. When you go home, act natural. I heard it. I heard it. The man said, "but if he finds out", And then Tina responded, "you know he'll kill us". I swear to you I heard it. I mean, it could be a figure of speech, you know? Like "I'd kill for a burger right now". You're not gonna really kill somebody for the hamburger. Well, it didn't sound like that to me. And you're sure it was them talking? I'm positive. Maybe the mike missed it. And you think your ears can pick up something - That a $5,000 digital unidirectional microphone can't? - Look What if Haggans isn't thinking about divorce? What if he's actually gonna use this evidence as an excuse to murder his wife? Wouldn't divorce be easier? Yeah, and it'd also be more public. Haggans doesn't strike me as the kind of man who wants his personal life on display. Well, you met him. Does he strike you as the kind of man that would be capable of murder? Anybody is capable of murder... G-Given the right circumstances. Haggans hired you to get information. You're not responsible for what he does with it, okay? I'm not gonna get those people killed. No info, no paycheck. Alright. I'll talk to Haggans again, okay? Are you gonna ask him if he's planning on murdering his wife? You know what? I might try something a little more subtle than that. Well, on the way we can stop by "Buzzwire". I'm friendly with one of the sound guys, And maybe he can help us clean up some of this audio. I had a boyfriend in college Who taught me how to pick locks. Thought it was a cool party trick. He also taught me how to chug a beer in one gulp. Not really as useful as an adult. It's one thing to be in someone's space When they invite you in. They make the bed, clean the dishes, hide the bong. But when they're not expecting company, that's when you see how someone really lives. So, let's see how Morgan really lives. I need to see Mr. Haggans. Mr. Haggans isn't here. I can see him. Well, yes, he's here technically, But I've been given strict orders not to disturb him. Okay, why don't you just tell him Mick St. John is here to see him? When Mr. Haggans gives me an order, I take it very seriously. You tell him, or I'm gonna tell him myself. What is it about "I don't want to be disturbed"... Mr. Haggans wants to know if you have the surveillance he requested. If so, I've been instructed to give you your final payment. I'm not giving the surveillance to anybody but Mr. Haggans... personally. You tell your boss when he's ready to see me, He can have his surveillance-- Not before. How'd that go? Haggans wouldn't see me. Okay. It doesn't mean he's a murderer, though. Doesn't mean he's not. I'm gonna keep following tina until we know for sure. Biltmore Hotel, room 713. One hour. We should follow them. They're gonna be at the Biltmore in an hour. Wait. How did you know that? Trust me. Don't know what I was expecting to find. Impressive shoes, though... Prada, Y3, Manolos... I'm in the wrong line of work. Guess immortals don't shop at shoe barn. On our way to Morgan's loft? Where are you? I know I know... It just only takes one minute or maybe just 2 minutes I have one thing I ... I have the perfect rig for this... And a long lens that'll pick up a bead of sweat from, like, a hundred yards. You're enjoying this way too much. You know that, right? Beth? Hi. Did you say something? Yeah, I said, come on, hurry up. Let's go! Okay. I'm just... Just making sure I... have everything. Always something... Are you okay? What you've got is good. We don't have much time. Come on, we don't want to miss anything. Let's go. Wow. Someone's sure getting into the spirit. I still don't know how you heard them talking about this. You must have ears like a bat. Uh, not like a bat, exactly. You know what? Be grateful. I used to date a lot of musicians, and after a few years on stage, They're just, like, deaf as doornails. - Musicians, huh? - Yeah. Hey. Hey, can you talk? Not really. Where are you? Still at Morgan's. That was close. Yeah, it was way too close. Oh, hurry up. The clothes are starting to hit the floor. Where are you? I'm at a hotel. Whose clothes are hitting the floor? You know something? I-I, uh I can't really get into this right now. Oh! My god, this is gonna be hot! Seriously, what are you guys doing? We're working the case. Sounds like you're working something. You have to hurry up or I'm just gonna start without you, - 'Cause this is hot. - Mick! I gotta go. I... I gotta go. Mick? Are they saying anything? Not unless they're using deep breathing and moaning as code. Listen to this. What would your father think about this? You're his wife. Ask him yourself. Haggans' wife is having an affair with his son-- Her stepson. Like that wouldn't be the final nail in our coffin. That's kinky... And a pretty good motive for murder. Yeah. Yeah. Hey! Hey! Hey! How's the case going? There's nothing like spending the afternoon cuddled up in a hotel room watching family members have sex. They're--They're not even actually related biologically, so... It was like pay-per-view, but more hair. Do you want to see their photos? They're so hot. I think--No. They're confidential. You're not blushing right now, but I think you're actually embarrassed. You're so cute. You're so old-fashioned. No, I'm not. You weren't so shy when it was happening. I'm so glad your guys are working so well together. Seems like you make quite the team. I was thinking maybe we could make this a permanent arrangement. I tend to work alone. I mean, there's gotta be something for Beth to do, right? We could make it a threesome or something. I would love that, but I've got my own investigation going on-- Research on this new story. You know Maureen-- relentless. But, um... you two have fun. Hey, listen, Beth, Morgan and I are gonna be here for a couple of hours. So, uh, maybe, uh, maybe  I'll see you when you get back. Maybe. I'll call you when I'm wrapping up. Hey. About what happened at the hotel... Which part? The kiss. That was nice, huh? Well, sure, but... Don't be all weird. It was-- doesn't mean anything. Unless you want it to. No. Of course not. I mean... Oh, I get it. You don't want me to tell Beth. You've got it bad for her, don't you? Which I gotta say, I don't think she's your type. - Really? - Uh-huh. Well, what do you think my type is? Well, that would be me... Looking so much like the ex and all. Mick St. John. This is Mr. Haggans' assistant. Mr. Haggans wants to know if you're ready To hand over the materials he requested. Well, that depends. Is he ready to meet with me? Mr. Haggans will meet with you if you have the surveillance. Okay, you tell him one hour, the Ca Va restaurant. We can discuss my terms of handing over the surveillance. You're meeting with Haggans? Maybe I can find out if he suspects that his son is the one involved with Tina. I'm taking everything back to my office on my way to the restaurant. I'm not giving Haggans anything until I know what he's up to. Let me have your memory card. Well, this is unexpected. Thank you. Sell that. I need to talk to you about Mick. I know you're his friend. Is he in trouble? I don't know. I think so. It's his ex-wife Coraline. Coraline died a long time ago. I don't think she did. I think she survived and became human and is masquerading as Morgan Vincent. I don't know what Mick has told you about me. Not much, but I know you're a... vampire. And I know he trusts you. And what do you want? The truth. I'm sorry, sir, but you can't just keep sitting here Without ordering something. I'm waiting for someone. Have a sandwich while you wait. - No, thank you. - Something off the dessert menu? I'm not hungry. Then why do you keep meeting people at restaurants? Fine, but at this point, maybe you should consider...? Your date's not showing. How did it go with Haggans? He never showed. He never intended to. It was a ruse to get me out of my office so he could steal the surveillance! Well, let's go to his office and confront him then. No. I have to get to Haggans' son. Haggans now knows about his relationship with Tina. All right. I'm gonna look up his address for you right now. Let's see... All right, here we go. Owen Haggans... - "22 Wedgewood Lane, Bel Air." - I'm on my way. - Be careful. - Yeah, yeah. Thought you were a photographer. Yeah, I am. You can still think that. Then why did one of my sound guys give me this jump drive to give to you? Because I asked him to clean up some audio for me. That's why. What story is this for? It's, uh, it's still in the concept stages, - But I think you're really gonna love it. - Mm. I met Morgan. And sure, she looks like Coraline-- A lot like Coraline. But it's not her. Morgan is not a vampire. What if Coraline found a way to become human again? Oy. First Mick, now you. There is no cure for vampirism-- No magic pill, no click your ruby slippers together and rejoin the mortal coil. Becoming a vampire is a one-way street. There has to be a way. I think Mick-- Look, when it comes to Coraline, Mick doesn't think with his big head. You have to understand, Mick and Coraline's relationship was one of those terrifying, completely self-destructive freak shows that you spend your whole life searching for knowing it can only end in one or both of you dead. That's your idea of love? What can I tell you? I'm a romantic. This was Coraline's house in Hollywood, where they first met. Yeah, it was quite the scene back then. She could really throw a party. So you knew her? Met her for the first time in New York. Lincoln was president. Mick said she was a courtesan. Yeah? Well, Coraline was a lot of things to a lot of people-- - Most of them men. - But Mick was different? Yeah. She wanted him and got him... And then really worked him over. But eventually, the crazy got to be too much, and Mick wanted out. You know, he'd break it off, but, uh, Coraline was like a bad drug habit. He kept going back to her. Until she took me? Mick couldn't stand the thought of a child dying because of him. Finally, one happy family. It was too much. It gave him the strength to break away once and for all. I remember the fire. I watched her burn. I haven't been able to ask Mick this. I know he feels guilty enough as it is, but why did Coraline choose me? Maybe she thought she could put a little family together and settle down, Like the woman who gets pregnant to save a bad marriage. Why you specifically? You were probably just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it didn't work. She didn't get him back. Look, I think you know Mick better than that. And you knew Coraline for a long time. So if she is back, what does she want? If Coraline is back, and that's a big "if", she's back for Mick. I made up my mind to see Coraline's party house for myself. It's one thing to want to know the truth, it's another to confront it head-on. My mind has spent so long trying to protect me... Shielding me from what happened. It was the only way I could feel safe. Even now, something inside me is screaming "stop", but I can't, and I'm beginning to wonder if I'll ever feel safe again. Yeah? My name's Mick St. John. I'm a private investigator hired by your father. Come on in. Thanks. I told you. No one else knows, just us. Hey, listen. When you go home, act natural, okay? It's planned out, But if he finds out we're trying to kill him-- Hey, listen. When you go home, act natural. It's planned out, but if he finds out - We're trying to kill him... - I know. He'll kill us first. So, uh, why would my father hire a private investigator? To follow Tina. He suspected she was having an affair, but he didn't know with whom. It was you? You broke into my office? We can't take the chance that anyone else knows. We'll never get to my father if he suspects. So we kill him tonight. Mick? Mick? Come on. Pick up, Mick. Mick. Here. Oh, my god. They must have hit me from behind. Oh, my god. Here. Thank you. All right, let's get you to a hospital. No, no, I'm fine. It's just a scalp laceration. They're always worse than they look. What? Uh, look, they look worse than they are. That's what I meant. Haggans wasn't the one planning the murder. I know that. Haggans is the intended victim. They're going after Haggans now. We have to get to him first. Oh, my god. Hi, honey. It's okay. You have to go to bed now, okay? There, there. This is the she kept me, alone, locked in this room, waiting for her to bring me to meet Mick, to lure him back. To make us a family in her deranged mind. Okay, there we go. You need to get some sleep tonight. You know why? Because tomorrow's a big day. You're gonna meet your new daddy tomorrow. I'm gonna take you to meet your new daddy. Hey. - Mr. Haggans isn't here. - Where is he? - Gone for the day. - Where'd he go? I'm not at liberty to say. Tell me where Haggans is, or you better hope this job has a good dental plan. He just left two minutes ago with his son. You take the elevator. Tina's waiting in the car for us. You're not gonna tell me what the plan is, where we're going? No. Come on, dad. You'll ruin the surprise. Surprise. Mr. St. John. Hey! What the hell are you-- That's my son! Yeah, it's your son. That's also your wife's lover. These two have been conspiring to kill you. That's impossible. Call the police. Now! Now! Morgan! Holy crap. What was that? And they said Jordan had air. The son and the stepmom have an affair, conspire to kill the husband/father? They probably figured with him out of the way, They could have both the company and each other. Remind me to have kids. Listen, Haggans' assistant, a guy named Tucker, Lured me out of my office for Owen. - He had to have been working with him. - I'll send a car. You do have evidence to back all this up? Audio and visual. We're gonna need those photographs. Morgan. Sorry. Sorry. I'm just still a little freaked out. I've never been almost killed. You got everything you need? Yeah. Go home and get cleaned up. You can bring everything down to the station tomorrow. Come on. Let's get out of here. Do you want something, Mick? Coraline. Coraline. Are you really surprised? How many clues did I have to give you? The proust book, our old song. I even ordered my favorite glass of wine. You really thought you killed me, didn't you? How have you done this, huh? How have you done... Become human? Yeah. I thought it would get your attention. You seemed to like the human girls. You're telling me there's a way back, hmm? You're telling me there's a cure? Tell me. Tell me. - Mick! - Wait. Mick! Mick! I got the proof. She's been lying to us, stalking us. Morgan is Coraline. - I know she is. - You know? Hi, Beth. How could you? This isn't what you think. No! No! No! What are you doing? Oh, my god. Try not to move. What have you done? Listen to me, Coraline. Try not to move. We have to get her to a hospital. Stakes don't kill vampires. They just paralyze them. She's not a vampire. She's Coraline! You just said so herself! She's Coraline, but she's not a vampire! Not anymore. She's human. There is a cure. She has a cure.
