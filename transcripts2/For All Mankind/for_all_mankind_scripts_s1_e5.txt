 Warren, I've got the printout of all the coordinates. Thanks. Okay, Endeavour, got you. Molly, you are live on all networks. I'm on TV? Really? Oh, I wish you'd told me. I'd have done something with my hair. I like this look. You look gorgeous, babe. Oh, my God. There's my girl. How come everything's about her? 'Cause... she's a novelty, you know? First woman astronaut. Yeah, but Dad's her boss. Okay, shh. Just eat your cereal. Molly, millions of people around the world

 are eager to hear your thoughts now that you're in orbit around the moon. W... It's pretty humbling. You can see the entire world from this window here. Hard to believe that anyone I've ever known, every country, every civilization, is contained in that tiny blue-and-white ball. Molly, we've got thousands of letters from women you've inspired. I have one here from eight-year-old Abigail Crouse in Solvang, California. I'd like to read it to you. "Dear Molly. I have loved space for as long as I can remember." My brother has models of all the Apollo ships, and I used to get in trouble for playing with them. But after you got picked to be on Apollo 15, my dad bought me a model of my own.

 I named the command module Cobb and the LEM Molly after you. Some kids at school say there's no water on the moon and your mission is a joke. But I believe in you, and I know you will find it. "Your friend, Abigail." Anything you wanna say to Abby? I'm sure she's watching. Abigail, I will try not to let you down. And that is a cut. We're off the air. Good job. A star is born. Don't forget the little people who helped you along the way. Just as fast as I can. Endeavour. Before Molly starts shopping for an agent, we got some good news for you. Rocky Ray and the geo boys have been going over the spectroscopy from your recon orbits, and they think that they have found ice. Tons of it. Literally, tons. Well, tell us where it is, and we'll bring you back a snow cone. Negative, Endeavour. The geo team will use that data to pick spots for later missions, 'cause the ice is nowhere near your landing site at Mare Frigoris. Where is it? It's at the south pole. Shackleton Crater. Let's go. Change the plan. Land us at Shackleton. That's quite a big change, Ed. No shit. 4,000 kilometers worth. No. Flight's giving that a big thumbs down. It's too big a risk, and you don't have the gear for that kind of exploration. You'll land at Frigoris, as planned. We'll re-task Apollo 16 for Shackleton. Before we left, lab coats told us the ice concentration at Frigoris was around 250 parts per million. So what's the read on Shackleton? After your survey, it could be 500 times better. Well, then I strongly suggest you folks rethink this. We didn't come all this way just to dig a bunch of dry holes. Houston, going off VOX for a few. Roger that, Endeavour. Let's have it, Mol. What happened to "stick with the mission plan, no matter what"? The mission's to find ice. We flew over Shackleton in the first place just to get the data they're all crowing about. - You on board with this? - Changing a landing site mid-flight? It's dangerous and stupid. I love it. Of course you do. You're not the one going down there. - Hey, you wanna swap jobs? - Hey. The CIA is worried that the Soviets will place military assets on the moon. Why would anyone put missiles on the moon? All I know is the president wants that base. We need a beachhead against the Soviets. Shackleton looks like the place for it, so if we can get Apollo 15 there first, we should do it. My crew gets the final say. Talk to them. We practiced for Frigoris. Nobody knows what's on the ground at Shackleton. We get no points if we crash and burn in some half-baked, last-minute approach. That's funny, 'cause "half-baked, last-minute" was your entire approach to training. Well, that was then. Look, sometimes you got to roll the hard six. What's that supposed to mean? It means no risk, no water from the moon. Look, if it were just me, gimme the dice. But if we auger in, it won't be, "Baldwin screwed the pooch." It'll be, "Women can't hack it in space." And what do you think they'll say if we come home empty-handed? What the press has being saying all along: That this mission is just a publicity stunt. Exactly. Endeavour, Houston. We've reconsidered a Shackleton landing. Flight dynamics has a DOI burn that will take you down there, but we do not know what kind of landing site you will find. It's high risk, so it's... it's your call. You still up for it? It's up to you, Cobb. Can't do this unless you're on board. Fuck yeah. Let's do it. That's what I'm talking about. Attagirl. Houston, this is Endeavour. We are go for Shackleton. You remember what you told me just before launch? Yeah, well, now you're really gonna do something. The lunar module Seahawk has left orbit on the far side of the moon, and they are preparing to initiate their descent to Shackleton Crater. That's one step closer for Astronaut Cobb on her way to becoming the first American woman on the moon. Excuse me, ladies. The historic mission also hopes to answer the question of whether there is ice on the surface of the moon. Scientists say that the most likely area... would be deep within craters that are rarely touched by the rays of the sun. The discovery of ice, and therefore water, would allow a permanent US lunar base... Karen, hi. Sorry I'm late... Oh, no, you made it before they landed. Yeah. Listen, uh, I know you folks like to drink, so I hope you like mezcal. I've never had it. Oh, you're in for a treat. This was distilled in Oaxaca. It's the kind the consul drinks in Under the Volcano. Is that a movie? No, no. It's a brilliant novel about an alcoholic. - Hm. - But, I mean, he has many redeeming qualities as well. He's kind of a tragic hero in his own warped way, so... - you should check it out... - Okay. Yeah. Why don't you come on in? 'Cause they're getting ready to land. Seahawk, five seconds to powered descent. Roger that. Ninety-nine. Proceed. Let's try not to screw this up, Cobb. Okay? The stakes have never been higher. Seahawk is now eight minutes away from a dangerous landing in uncharted terrain. Critics are calling NASA's last-minute change of plan "the most foolhardy thing that the agency has ever attempted..." Come here, buddy. And an unjustified risk to the life "of the first American woman to journey to the moon." Let's hope they're wrong. Throttle down. No flags. Looks good. High gate. Braking phase complete. Forward speed's good, descent nominal. Oxidizers running about one percent low. Okay. Houston, Seahawk. We're gonna level her out for a bit. Roger, Seahawk. PNGCS and AGS agree. This is close as I got on Apollo 10. Stick with me, kid. I'll take you all the way this time. That's the Cobb I was looking for. RCS is good. No flags. Position checks downrange. Short by 15 nautical miles. DPS pressure is still good. Coming over Shackleton. Sure is dark down there. Still over the crater, about four nautical miles from the rim, so altitude readings are high. Seventeen percent fuel. That could become an issue, Flight. Come on, Ed. PNGCS and AGS compare. Fuel and oxidizer within one percent. Looking good. Okay, boss. Time to find us a campsite. Okay. Houston, I have designated a nice, flat patch, about a quarter mile from Shackleton, as our landing site. That's gonna be a tight needle to thread. Well, that's what they pay me for. Two thousand feet, 42. Okay. This is a good spot. 800 feet. Forty-four. Forty-five. Seahawk, Houston. Go for landing. Okay. Here we go. Forty-four, 400 feet. Twenty feet per second. Okay. I'm in P66. Fifty feet at minus three. Cross-pointer's looking good. Seven percent fuel. Okay, picking up a lot of dust. Fifteen at one. Minus one. Six percent fuel. Eight feet. Minus one. - Contact. - Shutdown. Houston, Shackleton Base. Seahawk has landed. Wow. We're really here. I have never wanted a cigarette more in my entire life. You've come a long way, baby. Okay, let's go around the horn. Stay or no stay for T-1. Mm. What do you think of your dad? - He's the best. - He is, right? Mm. Oh! Hey. Baby! Oh, you are a sight. A beautiful, beautiful sight. - You too. - Oh, yeah. Tell me what you're doing at NASA. Not much. I'm going to PR events as the token black girl. - And that's it? - Mm-hmm. After everything you did to earn that pin, and that's all they give you? Yeah. Well, there is one other thing they want me to do. What? Fly to the moon. Wait. Are you saying that... - Yes! I have been assigned to Apollo 18! - Oh! You are shitting me! - No, Clay! I'm going! I'm going! - Whoo! I told you! I told you! They can't hold you back. There has never been a more modern, more complete family-friendly vehicle than... All right, I've got fresh corn here. Mom, can we watch Laugh-In until Dad comes on again? Sure. Just keep it on low. Let me help you clear the table. Oh, thanks, Trace. I was gonna make my fried chicken, but I ran out of time, so I had Sheila roast some. It's in the kitchen. I'll go get it. Oh, no, that's okay. It's pretty full here right now. Let's leave it in the kitchen and we can always bring it out later. - All right. - No. I don't think we could get Mr. Nixon to stand still for a "sock it to me." Sock it to me? Well, I guess congratulations are in order. I hear that you've been assigned to crew of Apollo 25. Yeah. Word travels fast. - Are you excited? - Oh, I'm out of my mind. You know, if someone had told me two years ago I'd be orbiting Earth, repairing a satellite, I'd have thought they were insane. Me too. So, when are you and Larry getting married? Uh, I don't know. We've only been seeing each other for a couple of months, so... So? My Frank knew the moment he laid eyes on me that I was the one. It's obvious you two are crazy about each other. What are you waiting for? I don't think Larry is ready to... Nonsense. Men don't know what they want. I actually had to drag Frank down the aisle. But I knew he was secretly glad I did. It's nice to see you, Gloria. Hi. You care for some corn? Uh, thanks. Sure. You must feel relieved to know that Molly's landed safely. You don't know the half of it. I haven't been able to sleep much these last few nights, you know? I just kinda... You... You ever dream about Ed augering in? That's what they call it, isn't it? When the plane... Yeah. That is what they call it, but the answer's no. Never. - Really? - Yeah. I don't dream. You've never had one dream in your entire life? Maybe when I was a kid, but... I must've outgrown them. You're a very fortunate individual, Karen. This dream last night, it kicked my ass. Mm. Try not to think about it. I wish I could do that. It was just so weird. I was walking across the surface of the moon, stark naked. No space suit or anything. That's absurd. Yeah, but in the dream, it seemed totally natural. I could even feel the grains of sand sifting through my toes. And then I came upon this huge crater, and I see all this smoke billowing out of it and then... You know, Wayne, I think that maybe talking about it doesn't help. You just have to put it out of your mind for now. Okay? Wait, wait, wait. Please just listen, listen. I need to tell someone who'll understand. I climb to the top of the crater and I'm looking down, and at the bottom is Molly's ship in flames. And then suddenly I'm running down into the crater and stumbling and there's sand getting in my eyes and my mouth. And I call out for her. And I get nothing. I can't find her anywhere. So I run around the ship, and then that's when I see... See what? Her head. It's Molly's decapitated head and her... 'Cause her helmet's cracked wide open, and her face is blistered and burned, and there's black... Wayne, enough. That's enough. We don't talk about these things. Ever. Take a step to your right. Let me get that rise behind you. How many more of these are we gonna take? I'm not Raquel Welch, for Christ sake. It's part of the mission. So we do it. Visor up. Okay. Houston, I suggest we wrap this up. Hope we got one Shorty likes. I'm sure he'll be ecstatic, Ed. If you could both turn to face the TV camera, the president of the United States would like to speak with Molly. Holy shit. Are you kidding? No, I'm not. And I'd like to remind you that we're on network TV. Sorry. Hope you can bleep that out. Uh, hello, Mr. President. Hello, Molly. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done for your country and for women everywhere. Well, it's an honor, Mr. President. I hope I can bring you back enough ice for a highball. I know how much you enjoy a stiff drink. Bring back enough for two, and I'll have that drink with you. I look forward to it, Mr. President. I pray that you and your crewmates have a safe voyage home. Thank you, Mr. President. Broadcast live from the moon. I never really believed I'd see this. I guess the times really are a-changin'. - To Molly. - To Molly. It sounds like Astronaut Cobb expects their search for ice to be successful. Over the next three days, Cobb and Baldwin will be using their lunar rover. Well, I hate to give you all the bum's rush, but I got to to get to bed. Uh, this early? It's only 6:00. Yeah. They completed their EVA, and Ed'll be bedding down soon and you know, when he goes to sleep on the moon, I go to sleep down here. And when he gets up, I get up. Oh. - Thanks. - Oh. Let's go. Come on. Thank you for everything. I appreciate your help today. I'll see you tomorrow. - Thank you, Karen. - Oh, bye. - Karen, I'm sorry if I, uh... - Thank you for coming. Um... - Okay. See ya. - Bye. Bye, Wayne. That guy is so freaking weird. And he smells funny. Oh, that's 'cause he's been smoking weed. - What? You mean like... - Marijuana. Jesus, Trace. In my house? No, no. I think he did it before he came over. Anyway, thanks for having us, Karen. Yeah, okay. - Hey, Margo. - Hi. Morning, Shackleton Base. White Team's back with you. Glad to hear it, Fred. Red Team mentioned we're seeing data but no picture. Still mounting the big eye on the rover. And is Molly's drink bag still squirting in her face? Negative. I bent the mic away from the mouthpiece, which is great for scratching your nose, by the way. I'll note that for the folks going on 16. Cycling the TV power switch now. You're in living color. The big eye's operational. All right. Let's go find ourselves a big bucket of ice. Roger that. Do mission commanders normally hold meetings here? - This one does. - Okay. Danielle. Welcome to the crew of Apollo 18. Thank you, sir. - It's Clayton, right? - Yeah, that's right. Let me grab another glass. I am really gonna work your ass off. I wouldn't have it any other way. We're gonna get together next week, sit down with Deke and go over the mission plan. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mm. I got to say, I am surprised I got assigned so quickly. I'm not. Your friend Molly's kicking ass up there. Really put to bed any notion that women can't cut it. 'Course, I never had any doubts. Neither did I. Clayton, you just get back from Nam? That I did. Someone take your ribbons? No. I threw them in the sentry's face on my way out the door. Lot of that going on these days. Might have to dig out a few of my old medals. There's a few faces I'd like to throw 'em in too. Mm. Oh. You a Louis Armstrong fan, Danielle? Um... Yes, very much so. You could say his Hot Five and Hot Seven records changed the DNA of American music. Don't know those. But I love his version of "Hello, Dolly!" Oh, yeah. "Hello, Dolly!" That's a good one. Hello. Karen. Uh, what are you doing here? I, I wanna talk to you. Sure. Come in. Can I get you some tea? I'm fine. Mind if I get some? No. That's for Santana. They're a band. Playing in Houston next month. Nice. Yeah. Oh, my... It's my dream. You're, you're painting it? Yeah. Get it out of my head. Is that what that is for too? It's a doobie. No, it's marijuana. Molly's career would be over in a heartbeat if someone found out you were using drugs, Wayne. Marijuana isn't a drug. It's a natural herb. Oh, then why is having it a felony? I don't know. Why don't you ask the liquor lobby? I see. You think that this is all a joke. That you can just do whatever the hell you wanna do. That you can get high and then, what, screw with the straight lady? Wow. You are really something. I thought you were the one person in this whole program who might understand. - Understand what? - That my wife could die up there! Maybe you can pretend that everything is fine. But I can't do that. - Just settle down, Wayne, okay? - Settle down? What? Settle... How do you settle down, Karen? I feel like my cerebral cortex is gonna explode. So, if I need to paint my nightmares to get them out of my fucking head or smoke a joint to keep from going stark raving mad, that's what I'm going to do! And I'll tell you what doesn't help. You coming over here and passing judgment on me. That doesn't help. - Okay, I didn't... - Because if I lose Molly... If she doesn't... Wayne, you're not gonna lose Molly, okay? Ed won't let anything happen to her, I promise. You can't control things with positive thought. Don't you guys get that here? We have no control. Going through the sample cases pretty quick, Mol. I wish we were filling them with ice and not just rocks. If we don't score today, we'll find it tomorrow. I'll believe it if you will. There may be downsides to being an astronaut, but it sure beats digging ditches. What you got for me? Just more rocks. Houston, this is another dead end. If there is ice here, it is down deep, or it's in that crater. Roger, Shackleton. Word is to wrap it up and head for the barn. Sounds good. Have another face tightener. Good for the soul. "Good for the soul." I like that. Mm. Mm. Ooh. So, where were you posted? Twenty-first Infantry, Da Nang. I knew some chopper pilots there. It's heavy shit. Ah, to say the least. You serve in Korea? I was too young. Um... Space kept me outta Vietnam. Of course it did. Well played. My dad was a Marine in the South Pacific. He never talked about it, but I read a few accounts. Horrendous. I guess I always wondered how I'd hold up under fire. But not too curious that you'd give up that astronaut pin and get in the shit yourself, right? What do you mean by that? What are you trying to say? Easy, tiger. Come on. I'm just saying you're better off not knowing. That's all. Right. So, what's it's like? - Combat? - Mm. At first you're terrified. Miserable. But then the fighting starts and suddenly everything is at stake. Your life. Your friends' lives. It's transcendent. You know, 'cause you're no longer a person. You're the platoon now, right? And the platoon can't be beat. You experience this savage joy in overcoming the enemy. Is that what happened at My Lai? That savage joy? I wasn't in My Lai. I know. I was just asking you what you think happened there. Since you seem to be such an expert. All right. That's enough. No. You wanted to know what combat was like. Not what it was like to commit murder. But I can understand your confusion, since you weren't in it. Instead, you let your buddies napalm villages and bomb schools. Yeah. You're probably right. I guess you only get to feel that savage joy if you're close enough to see the bullet hits. That's a fascinating insight. You make another one like that, and I'll kick your teeth down the back of your throat. I'm right here. Clayton! Clayton! What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, baby, all right? This is my world, my life you're messing with. Get out of here now. All right? Go. I will meet you outside. Damn it. You are way outta line. I'm outta line? He has been home one day. I brought him here to get his mind off what he's been through, and you just shoved his nose in it! Thanks for staying. You don't need to thank me. You know, um... Ed was shot down in Korea. For a week, I didn't know if he was alive or dead. And I started having a recurring nightmare. So you do dream. Yeah. How long did that go on? It's still going on. Anytime Ed goes into space. I never told him about it. I don't know. I just... I don't know why I'm telling you. No. Please tell me everything. Uh... It helps to say it out loud. What's the dream? Um... Well, I'm running through a jungle... and I'm being chased by an animal. I can't see it, but I can hear it growling at me. And I run and run and run... and run until I reach this clearing. Uh... And then? No. What's the point of this? Honestly. Look... Just tell me. What's in the clearing? This panther. Black as night with big, glowing yellow eyes. And it's feeding on Ed. Eating his entrails. But Ed is still alive. And he's looking at me. And he's so scared. He's so scared, like a little boy. And he's calling out to me, and I can't help him. Shit. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I did not come here to do this. I'm... Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Yeah. I got to thank you for going to bat for me on the whole diaper thing. I got to say, a Gemini bag was not what I had in mind to replace it. Thought you were looking for equality. Me and Gordo had to use those for two weeks on Gemini 7. Well, thank you for that image. Yeah, the frogmen who pulled us out of the spacecraft, they said it smelled like a latrine. It was bad. Bible says it's bedtime. Houston, I think we're ready to call it a day. Roger, Shackleton. And we'd like to leave the sensors off tonight. Surgeon's okay with that. Hey, Shane, buddy. I hope you're listening. I did something special today just for you. I wrote your name on the surface of the moon. It's going to be there for millions of years. Long after both of us are gone. That is so bitchin'. Good night, Karen. I miss you both. We miss you too. You asleep? No. It was nice. That thing you did for your kid. It's bullshit. I'm a great one for grand gestures, but on the everyday stuff... Never had a kid. They look like a lot of work. I'm... just not good at the dad thing, you know? What's the dad thing? Like... teaching him how to ride a bike. I mean, I totally fucked that up. Really? You're not a bad teacher. Even when I get pissy with you. Oh, that's my job. It's different with Shane. Different how? Like with the bike. He got... flustered... and scared. And that just made me angry. And Deke came by the house, so... it gave me an excuse to walk away. I just... I just left him... standing there. I'll never forget the look on his face. I remember thinking... "What the hell's wrong with me?" You're a selfish prick. So am I. You know, when I got this flight... Wayne was terrified. But I wanted it. So I let him think I couldn't see through his brave front. I chose to let him be terrified... so that I could go to the moon. That's pretty selfish. Oh, Karen's been going through that for years. Since Korea. Face it. We are egomaniacal narcissists. I bet Columbus was... and Magellan. And they had to be to do what they did. I say here's to selfish pricks. 'Cause we move the ball forward for mankind. Mr. Administrator, we're well into the final moonwalk and still no ice. Do you believe Apollo 15 will come home empty-handed? No. I am confident the ice is there and that our astronauts will find it. I think we should pull the plug. Our best option is to send Apollo 16 back there with climbing gear so we can explore the crater itself. Yeah, I don't think that's the best option. In fact, it's a shitty option. If we wait for Apollo 16, the Russians will win this. You want to explain that to the president? Then let's quit wasting their time. Get 'em into the crater. It's three times deeper than the Grand Canyon. How far do they need to go? A hundred meters should put us into the cold trap, where there's been no sunlight for two billion years. If there is ice, that's the sweet spot. As you can see, it's pretty damn steep. I mean, we can get down there, but the question is if we can get back up. Guys are working on that right now. And we've only got so much O2. Wish I had my old pickup. Had a winch. Be perfect for this. A winch is just an axle with some cable, right? And we got a buttload of S band cable. Question is if it can hold us. Wanna roll a hard six? Houston, can we make a winch out of the rover? I got to admit, wrecking government property is kinda fun. You might not think it's as much fun on the hike back. Why not? It's a nice day. Flight, their increased activity is going through their oxygen a lot faster than we planned. Okay. It's a three-kilometer walk back to the LEM. Let me know when it's time to pull the plug. Roger that, Flight. That's a good speed. Now, when I hook up and head down... I want you to keep both hands on the cable just in case something happens, okay? You're not thinking this through, boss. I learned to climb rocks back in Camp Fire Girls. And I climbed ropes at the academy. End of discussion. We got a technical problem, and it doesn't care who's boss. This rig's nowhere near as strong as the one on your truck. And even in one-sixth G, I weigh half as much as you do. You really want this skinny girl belaying your fat ass? Send me down. Boeing concurs with Molly, Ed. But you know they're just trying to minimize their risk. So, it's your call. I can do this. Trust me. You know, a few years ago it would have been inconceivable for NASA to approve such a precarious undertaking. But in the race for the first moon base, Mission Control has thrown caution to the wind. In the shadow of Apollo 10, and the "culture of caution"... - Widely criticized... - Excuse me. In the wake of the first Soviet lunar landing... Hmm. Late again, huh? Didn't want to disappoint you. Uh... I brought you something. I spent all day on it. It's from your dream. Yeah. I know what it's from. Thank you. You're very welcome. Look, we should get to the TV. Molly's going down into the Shackleton Crater right now. Wait, what? That's... When did this happen? It's okay. Come in. I'll explain. I'll explain. You know, typically, astronauts train for years before a trip to the moon. They do practice procedures for every minuscule aspect of their missions, no detail left to chance. Against this backdrop, Cobb and Baldwin's decision to undertake this complex, unplanned maneuver is a bold and unprecedented choice. Houston, we are in place for descent. Roger, Ed. You are go for descent. You ready, Mol? Belay on. Slack. Molly is now out of sight in the crater. Easy, Ed. Supported only by a thin electrical cable, Astronaut Cobb is now descending... What if the cable breaks? That crater's miles deep. Hey, Wayne. Breathe. Molly, your transmission dropped out a little. Roger drop out. Albedo's pretty uniform. I'm not seeing much in the way of impact melts. Tension. Gotcha. I'm heading into the darkness now. I'm gonna go slow from here. Roger slow. Slower. - Tension. - Gotcha. Letting my eyes adjust. Mol? Would you check your video? How's that? Okay, we're good. Not much to see. Just rocky outcroppings. Not much dust. Ed, lower. Tension. Gotcha. Thirty meters from the rim. Might as well get a baseline here. You okay, Mol? Molly? Mol, you okay? Yeah, things just got away from me a little. Okay, let's see what we got. There's not much dust. This is basalt, I think. No, breccia. This is bedrock. No ice. Let me try again in another 20 feet. Lower. Flight, Molly's O2 consumption is higher than expected. I'm concerned she won't have enough to search much longer. How much time do you figure? At their current rate of consumption, about two minutes, max. And that's cutting it close. They have a long walk back. No telling what can screw up on the way. How long can this go on? They only have 300 feet of cable, so... 300. Here. Please. That's the end of the line, Molly. What you see is what you get. Roger. I'm gonna give both sides a whack. No joy. Hammer's just giving me four centimeters of penetration. It's just more basalt. Still no ice. That's it, Flight. Time's up. Wrap it up, Fred. Ed, Molly, you are bingo on O2. We'd like you to knock it off and head back up. Negative, Houston. I wanna try something else here. I'm pulling you back up. I need more time. Don't make me drag you up those rocks. You don't wanna do that, Ed. What the hell is she doing? Her heart rate's up to 170. She's sucking O2 like crazy. This is done. Flight? That's a no-go, Molly. Molly, it's time to come home. Say again, Houston. Couldn't hear anything after "that." This is amateur bullshit. Flight, she's gonna get herself killed and take Baldwin with her. - Fred! - Molly, stop screwing around. Molly, you've proved everything you need to prove. Time to come back up. You hear me, Mol? Molly, do you read? Roger. Just one more thing to do. All right, I'm giving you 30 seconds, then I'm hauling you back up. Deal. Houston, are you getting this on-screen? Roger, Molly. Looks like you were right, Ray. That's... It could be... That could be ice. Folks here are gonna want you to bring that back for testing. Yeah, I figured. But here's the clincher. Oh, my God. It looks like we have ourselves a lava tube full of ice. Oh, my God. No way. - Get Molly out of there now. - Yeah. Ed, pull her up. Roger. Move it, Molly. Yeah, what are you waiting for? Start me up. Damn, you put on weight down there? Oh, that's right. Woman does all the work and then the man complains. Fred. Tell them to can the chatter, preserve the O2. They can jaw it up all they want when they get to the LEM. Water on the moon. NASA's dangerous gamble seems to have paid off. Shackleton Crater may well be the site of America's first lunar base. They're in. They're back inside the LEM, and they appear to be safe and sound. - They're good, buddy. - Just incredible. - Just gonna throw up. - Yeah, it's been a day, right? - Let's get a drink. - Yes. With their discovery of lunar ice in tow. The press is on your front lawn. Don't think they're going anywhere until they get a statement from us. Well, let us go amongst them. Uh, maybe you two should go. I've never really talked to the press. Nonsense. You'll do just fine. Come on. Okay. Never knew it could feel so amazing just to breathe. Houston, you guys don't know how good you got it. Actually, I think we do. Even Margo's smiling. Oh, wow. Someone get a photo of that. Doc Chase has insisted that we amend your timeline by 15 minutes to give you a moment to just breathe. Get some oxygen into your system. He's also keen that you rehydrate. - That we can do. - Oh, yeah. What? I got to see what it was all for. It's melting. Seahawk, you are go for liftoff. Roger, Houston. We got the goodies in the freezer, and we are ready to do some flying. Guidance steering is in. Okay. Master Arm is on. Good liftoff. Right on profile. Boy, what a view of the crater. Trajectory is good, Flight. Right down the pipe. On schedule. Seventy-eight hours, 33 minutes. Remote guidance is on target. Looks like the habitation module just flew over the Apollo 15 LEM descent stage. Two fifty at 15. Fuel 12 percent. One sixty, three feet per second down. Fifty feet. Two feet per second. Contact light. Engine cutoff. Touchdown confirmed. Copy that, FIDO. Jamestown Base has landed on the edge of Shackleton Crater. - Let's leave the lights on for the boys on Apollo 21. - Let's leave the lights on for the boys on Apollo 21. How about that? We're on the moon to stay.
