  (gasps)  No.  (fast-paced piano playing)  Hello.  Hello.  Okay, I'm worried you aren't   in love with me anymore  and I am afraid   to bring it up  because maybe you'll   admit that you aren't  or you'll think   I'm being paranoid  which then might make   my concern  a self-fulfilling   prophecy.

 You're being paranoid.  Your eyes look at me   dead sometimes.  That is so unfair.   My eyes sparkle!  Don't you think, like,  now might be a good time  to tell me you love me though?  Now?  Do I need to?  No one needs to,  I just thought   you might want to.  Like, I'd inspire  a compulsion in you to say it.  I thought it was obvious  'cause I'm, like, here.  No, lots of people in the world   are laying in bed right now  with someone   they don't love.  (sighs)

 (dramatic piano music playing)  This music is making me   seem more insane than I am.  Matilda,  use the keyboard!  Sorry!  ?  Tellulah: I've been  meaning to tell you something.  What?  I've been   texting Leonard.  Is that bad?  Oh, no, it's bad.  Are you still   in love with him?  I'm absolutely   not in love with him.  Do you want me to stop?   I can stop.  I am not in love with him!  I hate him,  he's a villain.  Ah, but love and hate  are two sides of the same coin.  I just, I don't want  my friend dating a bully.  A bully? What, are we   eight years old?  I just think we should be  trying to date nice boys.  You are so obsessed with him   it's not even funny, bitch.  Should we see   if he'll send us a nude?  Is... Is that an option?  Boom! You wanna   see his junk so bad!  Oh, my God!  Of course I do.  Okay.  What...  What are you saying?  Leonard, I want to see  your throbbing member so bad.  Love, Genevieve.  -What?  -I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  It's from me.  (cell phone chimes)  He wants a pic   of my vag first.  He asked for that?  He's no fool.  Why do you have to go first?  Feminists go first.  Do I send it?  Are you crazy?  I don't know what to say.  -Do I take a photo?   -I'm not taking it.  -I don't know what to do.   -Don't.  Let's send someone else's.  There's so many variations,   just pick one.  Yeah, but, like,   which one?  A good vagina,   I don't know.  A good va...   What's the criteria?  That one looks like   Judge Judy.  -No it doesn't.   -Okay, okay.  Um, this one has  a nice sense of symmetry  and I believe it for you.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  that one's the best one.  That's-that's   a good one.  Oh, my God.  Okay, I'm-I'm sending it to you. (computer beeps)  -(cell phone chimes)   -Got it.  Sent it.  (cell phone chimes)  Here you go.  (softly):   Oh, my God.  That's his actual...  I can tell by his hand.  Hey, boyfriend.  (unenthusiastically):   Hey.  What?  (sighs)  I'm feeling down   after last night.  Still?  Well, you didn't really do much  to make me feel better.  Shh.  Hey, hey, hey.   Shush now.  Hey, hey.  (chuckles) Ow.  (kisses)  Are you gonna  be like this all day?  I was hoping maybe we could   go to the beach.  You hate the beach.  Yeah, when I say   the beach,  I mean, like,  somewhere where   I'm not in trouble.  You aren't in trouble.  -I'm not in trouble?   -You're not in trouble.  Why would I be?  Why would anybody  ever wanna put me in trouble?  I feel like you're not   taking me seriously.  I'm not taking you seriously!  Well, please do!  (grunts)  I'm in trouble. I'm in  palpable, palpable trouble.  You're not in trouble.  I'm not mad at you, okay?  I'm just feeling hurt.  You want me to go   onto the naughty corner?  Is that what you want?   Yeah, I'm gonna go.  I'm gonna be  in the naughty corner.  Turn around then.  (indistinct chatter)  Girls send pictures   all the time.  Uptown and downtown.  It's disgusting.  (whispering):   Tellulah and I sent that   exact vagina last night.  That's your vagina?  We got it off the Internet.  Leonard sent us his  and then we swapped photos.  You broke the law.  It's child pornography.  We don't know how old   that vagina is.  Leonard, though.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  You could get jail time.  I mean, or at best,  fine/community service.  Mm-hmm. Yeah,  I'm deleting it right now.  Um, but before you do,   can I... see it?  It's so good.  Ha.  I would have  stopped you if I had been  invited to   the sleepover.  You're gonna have to  tell Tellulah what he's done.  She thinks  I'm in love with him.  She'll think  I'm up to something.  Barb: I'm just not ready  to show the whole school   my vagina.  Not yet.  What? No, you don't   have to do that.  We'll see.  All right, let's do this.  Let's get... Let's get serious.  How you doing?   How you doing, buddy?  What's wrong, buddy?  Okay, last night  I wanted you to tell me  that you love me,   and you didn't.  And I don't understand why  you didn't wanna  make me to feel better?  All right.   Well, it's just...  Wait, do you   want the truth  or do you want me to say   cute distracting things   so we can move on?  No, you always do that.  I want you  to tell me the truth.  Okay, I'll tell you   the truth.  (cell phone ringing)  Ah!  Who could that be?  Hello?  Hello, it's Matilda's   teacher, Sam.  Hi! Hello.  Sam (over phone):   I heard about Juilliard  and want to bask   in the glory with you.  Yeah, it's great.  It's great.  She's gonna put me   in trouble as well.  Everybody just wants   to put me in trouble.  ...any questions   I can answer for you?  Questions? Was I meant   to have questions?  No, I don't have   any questions.  Have you decided to,   in fact, enroll?  Nicholas (over phone):   Yes, of course.  Okay, so, um,  do we need to make a plan,  or do you already have one?  Nicholas:   Yeah, I have a plan.  I have heaps of plans.   I have so many plans.  I just wanna make sure   we aren't underestimating  what we're up against here.  Me, too.  Okay, I gotta go now   I'm afraid.  Nicholas: Okay, thanks.  Thanks, Sam.  -Wait, are you still here?   -Sam: Yeah.  I never hang up first,   as a therapeutic tool.  Nicholas: Oh. Oh, okay.  Well, I'm going to hang up.  -Sam: You're held   until you do.   -Okay.  (cell phone beeps)  -All right, you, you.   -Me?  -Yes.   -Mm-hmm.  So, I was all cozy,  and then you came in   with all this hassle,  and it was annoying,  and I find it hard to say  I love you  when I don't mean it.  Okay, wow.  I guess I didn't want  the truth at all then.  What, sometimes I don't feel it   so then I don't say it.  There are times  when you don't love me?  Yeah, that's normal,   isn't it?  I don't think so.  No, I think that's...  I think that's normal.  I do. I just think   other people are better  at lying about it   than me.  Well, aren't there times   when you don't love me?  No.  Well, I think   that's odd.  ?  Are you guys going  to the show's after party?  -Drea (over radio): No.   -No.  They never invite   the tech crew.  Without us they'd be performing   in the dark with no sound.  (chuckles)  You guys wanna  come over to my house?  -Yeah.  -Jeremy (over radio): Yeah.  Jeremy, I think Drea   has a crush on me.  Jeremy: Drea isn't queer.  Is she? Are you?  I don't wanna answer.  (Matilda giggles)  You guys know  I'm sex-positive, right?  Yeah.  I've been thinking   about college  and how basically  we're never gonna   see each other again.  I-I didn't apply   for college.  My parents   don't think I'm ready.  You wanna  fool around together?  Whoa. Random.  In the controlled environment   of my bedroom.  Sounds like   a lot of... touching.  Yeah, touching.   Nudity, if you want.  Jeremy: Uh, I don't know.  Do I ask my mom?  She-she'll wanna   know everything.  So we go to your bedroom   and then what?  How does it start?  I'll tell you when it starts.  I wanted to ask that, too.  Uh, I don't even know   how it starts.  I'll just say, "I'm starting."  -I'm in.   -I'm in.  I just want my boyfriend   to love me all the time.  I do!  But you think   I'm annoying.  Sometimes.  I can't control what I think.  -(scoffs)   -Ugh!  I wish I just lied to you,  and we lived a lie  where you're never annoying.  I manage to love you   all the time.  Do you? 'Cause it   doesn't feel like it  when I look at you   looking at me like that.  It feels like actually  you're highly critical of me.  Do you even love me?  I love you.  I just wish you weren't  an open sink hole of need.  (cell phone ringing)  (chuckles)  One moment. Sorry.  -Oh, hey, honey.  -Genevieve (over phone): Hi.  Um, so, this-- this   thing happened.  Oh, no, not another thing.  I'm in a thing with Alex   at the moment.  He's glaring at me.  This big, big glaring.  I don't have anyone else to ask. Not that you would want   anyone else, though,  because you've got me.  Leonard asked Tellulah   for a vagina pic.  Whoa, we're here already?  Looks like it.  I've never even   sent a nude pic.  -Never?   -No, it doesn't   photograph well.  I turn up with it, though,   and then I show it.  Genevieve: Focus!  We sent a fake one.  Cunning.  And Leonard passed it around   the whole school.  Not a shocking twist.  Genevieve: Do I tell her   what he's done?  She'll think   I'm happy about it.  Why will she think   you're happy about it?  I used to like him.  Who the hell is this Casanova?  Hello?  I don't know what to do.  I don't know, you've got   more information than I do.  I think I should tell her   what he's done.  That's sounds very sound.  Do that.  -Thanks.   -Nicholas: Bye.  Kids these days.  Huh?  All right, okay,   where were we?  Uh, "open sinkhole of need."  Probably a bit much.  Of course.  I'm an open sinkhole of need.  You did this to me.  -I used to be fun!   -Oh, come on.  When I did just  one little thing in Mexico  that you didn't like,   you packed your bags.  You threw  raw fish on me.  And it annoyed you  and you wanted to leave me.  It's normal.  I'm really sorry   if I hurt you.  No, I really wasn't, um...  I really wasn't   bothered by it,  I just wanted   some ammunition.  I wish I could figure out   how to stop loving you  so I could   just be free.  -(cell phone ringing)   -Sorry. One moment.  -No, please take it.   -Yeah?  Oh.   Hello. Hey, babe.  Remember we decided   I could have sex   if I asked you first?  I feel a little   taken out of context.  You said I could be   sex-positive.  That is a different thing,   but go on.  Can Jeremy and Drea  come over for a threesome?  Um...  Here?   Like, over here?  They're waiting.  Nicholas:   Drea I saw coming,   but Jeremy?  They're both autistic.  Nicholas:   Okay. Well, that...  that doesn't   matter to me.  But...  (sighs)  Yeah, I can't think   of a reason why not.  Well, think harder.  Great. Will you   tidy up my room?  What, now I have   to do cleaning?  Everyone's having fun,  and I'm just stuck here   with you.  What? I was just joking.  Stop it. I'm... funny.  Why won't you  just think that I'm funny?  Because it's not fun-n-ny!  It's mean!  Why won't you  just love me again  so that I can  love you again?  Ugh!  Okay. Fine.  Yeah, yeah,  yeah, yeah.  In summary, not everything's  gonna be perfect all the time,  and that's okay.  Kiss?  -Fine.   -Yeah.  So are we   hosting this thing?  Ugh.  Can't they just do it  behind a shed like I had to?  You never did that.  No, of course not.  Every time it's like  entering the cave of wonders.  Oh, brother. No.  Ugh.  (exclaims)  Maybe Matilda  isn't prepared for college.  Hmm.  Look at you over there  cleaning up my sister's mold.  Maybe I just should  have been better.  -Yes!   -Yeah.  (both laugh)  Do you wanna move in?  What?  Do you wanna move in?  Where's this coming from?  Um, I don't know.  I was trying to...  I was trying to figure out  a way to make you like me again  and that's what   I came up with.  Well, how long have you   been thinking about this?  Just now.  Well, people   think about things.  You know,   contemplate them.  And are thoughtful.  Not this guy, though.  I'm spontaneous.  You're insane!  You have two children   living in this house.  You can't just invite me   to move in.  -Yeah.   -It's erratic!  We have something  we need to tell you.  Is it that you guys   are dumb bitches?  Because I already   got that memo.  When you say   things like that,  who is it for?   Is it for us?  Seriously.  I heard about yours  and Genevieve's sleepover.  And I'm not   mad about it,  but I am concerned.  Leonard has taken a poor  innocent woman's vagina photo,  and spread it around the school   thinking it was yours.  I'm sorry, babe.  Well, it was  a very beautiful vagina.  Very symmetrical.  (sighs)  You coming?  Wh-where?  To find Leonard.  There he is.  I need you guys   for moral support.  What are you   gonna do?  -I'm asking him out.   -What?  Still?  Can you just   explain to me  what he would have to do  for you to stop liking him?  I mean, how evil is he   allowed to be?  You want some advice?  -I don't know.  -She's just gonna say it.  Crushes are over,   ladies, okay?  And sex is coming.  And I'm gonna do it with  the bad guy with the good face,  because I'm a highly   visual person.  I'm wanna look back  on my high school years  and be so proud   that I did it  with all the hottest guys   in school.  More than one?  -There's more than one, Barb.   -You know why?  We have   the rest of our lives  to settle for someone chubby   with a nice job  who respects us.  I am not prepared  to compromise on hotness now.  Barb: There she goes.  Chasing tail.  Hey.  What's up?  You wanna chill?  Yeah. Yeah, cool.  What's gonna   happen to her?  Everything.  Oh, my God, Duke,   my long lost love.  Hello.  Hello, my friend.  Well, we've got   stuff to do, so...  Yes, you do.   Yeah. Okay.  Hello, Drea.   Hello, Jeremy.  No one  ate my soup.  What is going on   in there?  It's very...  I just feel very...  -Alex: Hmm.   -Hello.  Can Duke stay in the kitchen   an hour or two?  -Depending...  -Yes. Yes, of course, he can.  Hey, Duke.   Hey, buddy.  Ready to roll.  Okay, Jeremy,   take off your shirt.  Jeremy: I got, like...  It-it felt too...  I got embarrassed.  That's fine.   Should I take mine off?  Not yet.  Well, what are we   doing first?  -Oral.   -Jeremy: Oral?  Haven't even showered.  What if we each say   what we wanna do?  Um...  I don't want to.  You don't have my consent.  I hope that's cool.  Um, I wrote a list of things   I wanted to try.  In case you guys   wanna do it instead.  -Ice cubes, hot wax, biting.   -(door closes)  He's such a loser.  (smooching)  Alex: Ah, yeah, sexy.  (chuckling)  Okay.  Okay.  Just to be clear,   I, like,  really don't want   you to move in.  I just, I wasn't thinking.  Yeah, I don't  want to either.  No one wants to.  Matilda: Okay.  Let's do this.  Mm-hmm. Okay.  Um, the-the thing is...  I'm hypo-sensitive   to touch,  which you might think  means I don't feel things  but actually I do,   just very faintly.  It's like a tickle  and it isn't that nice.  Okay.  So you have to  grab me firmly.  Um, can I grab you   to demonstrate?  Mm-hmm.  You try.  Okay.  -Can-can you grab me harder?   -Okay.  Harder.  That's awesome.  Okay, now do it to me.  Now this.  Hi, Jeremy.  -Hey.   -Oh, no.  J... Jeremy is   in the hallway?  Like he froze.  (chuckling)  Hey, buddy,   you want some soup?  -Yeah.   -Yeah!  You want some soup.   Come on.  Thank you.  Good soup.  (laughing)  Yeah?  ?  Genevieve:   This is my apology.  From the back row.  Can you hear me?  This is my apology.  I took too long.  And the mold came.  And the sun fell.  I'm moondust.  I'm aftertaste.  This is my apology.  For a slow-motion pace.  Well, we did it.  It took three geniuses   and 16 years,  but we finally got our first  call to the principal's office.  Mm.  Being here   really brings back memories.  I almost feel   like that class-skipping,  whippet-doing 16-year-old again. Yeah. Now you're   just the work-skipping,  whippet-doing mom   of a boy who gets bullied.  (chuckles softly)   Honestly, I'm surprised  it took Marc this long   to get picked on.  I mean,   he's a weird, gifted kid  in an Atlantic City   public school.  I wonder   what finally did him in?  Oh. Could have been   a hundred things.  I mean, he says,   "Good morrow."  He's a vocal advocate   for thyroid health.  He runs like his arms are trying  to get away from his torso.  Yes. Yes.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennett?  Oh, my God.   Sweetie, are you okay?  Who did this to you?   Just give me a name.  Kids fall off the jungle gym   all the time.  No, I think   you both misunderstood.  Marc wasn't the victim.   He was the bully.  No. No, that can't be right.  I mean,   Marc couldn't hurt anybody.  Last night, he got trapped   under his weighted blanket.  Technically,   it was just a top sheet.  Marc didn't use his fists.  He has a way of making people   who aren't as bright as him  feel inferior.  Sweetie, you can't make fun   of other kids  because they're not   as smart as you.  Actually,   the victim wasn't a student.  You didn't tell me   he was going to be here.  -Marc bullied his teacher?   -No.  I simply correct him   when he is wrong.  Which is all the time.  (sighs)  He has repeatedly undermined me. I've lost the respect   of the whole class.  You lost that yourself when  you said you went to Dartmouth.  It's an Ivy!  Sweetie, you can't treat   your teacher like this.  You have to apologize.  All I did was tell the truth.  Apologizing would be lying.  Connie, you promised   you'd make him stop.  Connie can't help you now.  ? ?  I can't believe   Marc bullied his teacher.  Brains and cruelty?  I may have finally found   a running mate.  I talked to him about it;  he wasn't trying to be a bully.  I think he's just acting out   because he's bored  and not being challenged   at school.  You know, you guys acted out,   too, but in different ways.  Like when you grew human ears   on the backs of mice  so you could "play God."  Funny story,  most of those mice went insane.  This is a problem.  I don't know how we can keep   sending Marc to that school.  So, send him to ours.  They'll accept anyone   related to me sight unseen.  We can't afford a third kid   in private school.  Money doesn't just grow on the  backs of mice like ears, Nicole. If he's bored, can't you just   skip him a few grades  so he'll be more challenged?  Oh, he is not emotionally   mature enough for that.  And how's he gonna   reach the urinals?  I guess he could stand back   and arc it.  What about sending Marc   to Marlboro Charter?  They have a gifted program.  Jason Berger went there  after our school kicked him out  for using the robotics lab   to build a girlfriend.  Oh, we have dinner with them   on the 24th  to celebrate their anniversary.  What's Marlboro Charter?   Sounds expensive.  No, it's free.  It's like a public school   with a specialized...  He stopped listening   after "free."  I stopped listening after  you said you have a dinner date  with a pervert   and his robot girlfriend.  From what he says,   she's the pervert.  And we think Marlboro Charter's   gifted program  would be perfect for Marc.  He wrote his first concerto   when he was four  and then self-published   a magazine  that gave it a rave review.  Well, it's quite impressive.  And while my little   academic sandbox  is open to all qualified   children in the district,  I'm concerned about   Marc's history of bullying.  I understand.  But that was just   a one-time thing.  The class is a little slow   for him,  so he's bored and acting out.  Interesting.   "He's bored and acting out."  Tell me, was that also   your excuse  back when you bullied me?  Uh... I'm sorry, when I...?  I could tell   you didn't recognize me.  Ventnor High,   we graduated together?  Oh, my God!   Yes, yes, of course.  Dr. Walker. How are you?  You were the architect  of the most humiliating moment   of my life.  Well, how have you been   since then?  I can't believe Marc's bullying   was a one-time thing.  The apple rarely falls   far from the tree.  Are you kidding me?  That apple fell so far   from the tree,  I wouldn't believe   it's our apple  if I didn't see the tree   push it out with my own eyes.  Marlboro appreciates   your interest.  I'll pass Marc's application   on to my colleague.  Well, thank you both   for your time.  Well, there goes any shot   of getting into Marlboro.  That guy really hates you.  I mean, that shredder   was brand-new.  I feel like he bought it   just for that meeting.  I don't even know   what he was talking about.  I wasn't a bully in high school. I played a few pranks.  I was voted class clown.  Sure, but clowns   aren't always funny.  I mean, the most popular ones   terrorize Gotham  or live in the sewer   and eat children.  Hey.  How did it go at the school?  Uh, great, buddy. Yeah.   We-we should hear soon.  I'm hopeful it works out.  Did you see that?  I've never seen him   that amped up about anything.  Yeah.  I know.  I got to fix things with Walker. So we'll-we'll just call him   and apologize.  That's perfect.  Except for I have no idea  who he is or what I did to him.  I got to figure this out.  Someone has to remember him.  I don't remember him.  Wait. Was this the guy  you stapled into   the mascot outfit?  -No, that was John Norwood.   -Oh.  What about the dude   whose deodorant  you switched for spray glue?  Ryan Farley.  And how was I supposed to know  he sprayed deodorant down there? Who does that?  -What?   -(scoffs) No one.  That's crazy.  Okay, okay... Oh! What was   the name of the flat-assed guy  you shoved into the locker   during homecoming?  Oh-oh-oh, oh.   Uh, uh, his name was Mike.  (clears throat)   Mike Bennett. She married him.  (chuckles)  You know, the more we talk   about all the stuff I did,  it sounds more mean than fun.  Was I just a bully   in high school?  No... no, babe.  You just-- you did some...  cruel things at the expense   of other people's confidence  in their white jean collection.  Wow, Mike.   You found the only thing  that a white guy   can't get away with.  So Walker was right.  I am the jerk tree,  and Marc is the apple   that didn't fall far from me.  Maybe you were a tree   on the jerky side,  but you're   a different person now.  Pancake-Ass is right.  Why don't you just show this   Walker guy that you changed.  Uh, invite him over   for dinner or something.  Yeah, or do what you did to us:  invite him over for beer   and pizza,  and then talk about stuff   he can't even contribute to  because he went to   a different high school, Kay!  All right, you know what?   Let's give it a try.  We'll roll out the red carpet.  Oh! Was Walker the guy   you rolled in that carpet?  MIKE:   No-no-no-no-no.  Uh, buh-buh-buh-buh, also me.  Walker just e-mailed back.  He is in for dinner tomorrow.  But he said his "girlfriend"   can't make it.  Weirdly, he's the one  who put "girlfriend" in quotes.  Great. Did he mention   any food allergies?  'Cause we throw a couple nuts   in his salad,  next thing you know,   we're saving his life  and he owes us.  -Ha!   -Oh. Hey, buddy.  What did we say about you   and lurking?  Don't get caught.  Maybe now's a good time   to talk to your apple.  Hey, sweetie.  Here. Sit.  You know,  I've been thinking   about all the stuff I did  when I was in school,   and you know what I realized?  It is never okay to bully.  -Well, actually...   -I hate when they start   sentences like that.  I recently read an article   that I wrote  that highlights   the sociopolitical benefits  of diminishing the weakest   among us.  From an evolutionary standpoint, ineptitude should be ridiculed,  as to discourage that trait   from the species.  Does everything have to be   a nature documentary?  Just be kind to people,  even if they're dumber than you. So, based on that premise,  I should be extra nice to Brian. What a beautiful sentiment   from my brilliant  and symmetrically-featured   sister.  In case your lackluster   intelligence isn't following,  it is I who am   being nice because...  because of what Mom said.  Interesting.  They're being nice to be mean.  -No, no-no-no-no-no,   don't learn this.   -MIKE: Guys,  niceness is not a weapon, okay?  It makes the world   a better place,  and also, it's a great way   to hedge your bet  in case there really is   a heaven.  So just put your egos aside   and-and just,  you know... be good.  Forever.  Yes!  Definitely forever.   But especially tomorrow.  Because Marc's academic life   hangs in the balance,  and we have to prove  that we are a warm,   loving family,  and not just a bunch of bullies. Hey, Dad, can I borrow   your hammer?  My imaginary friend   needs to be taught a lesson.  Hey, what do you think?  Pretty clean, right?  I mean, I had to   drill the closet door shut  'cause it wouldn't stay.   But that's for tomorrow us.  Nice. Look what I got.  Nothing says "warm, kind home"   like a welcome mat.  Good news, it was on sale.  Bad news, it says   "Welcome to our ho ho home."  That's perfect. He's gonna think we're year-round   Christmas people.  Those freaks   are nice to a fault.  BRIAN:   Mom,  your deceitful daughter   plagiarized  my look for the night.  Plagiarized? You took that   turtleneck out of my drawer.  What happened to you two   out-nice'ing each other?  That tiresome charade   ran its course.  Yeah, it got weird when Nicole   tried to draw me a bath.  Okay, Walker is going to be here  any minute.  I don't have time   for your your fighting  and competing right now.  Nicole gets the turtleneck,   Brian gets the khakis,  no one gets a bath.  Why can't they ever   just make anything easy?  Isn't it obvious?  I was a bully, and now  I'm raising an army of bullies.  Well, I don't know   about an army.  I'd say maybe   an elite task force.  I was just worried about Marc,   but it's all of them.  It's like my mean DNA   combined with their brains  makes them   bullying supersoldiers.  Well, we can't count on  the kids, so it's just gonna be  up to us tonight to make sure   that-that we're nice.  Okay, you know you're already,   like, professionally nice,  so you're just saying that   to remind me.  -What?   -Do you not think I'm nice?  Yeah, of course   you're nice, babe.  Yeah-- I'm just, I'm saying,  you know, it never hurts to, uh, -be more nice.   -What the hell is more nice?  -Not this.   -(doorbell rings)  Great.  Now I'm all in my head   about "more nice."  You know, I'm gonna "more nice"   your head right up your...  (gasps)   Hey, you!  Get in here.  -I'm a hugger.   -Oh.  Careful, I have a soft spine.  This is a very quaint home.  Shoes on, I assume.  Dr. Walker,   thank you for coming.  We're sorry your girlfriend   couldn't make it.  Ah. Yes, well, actually,   we broke up.  My decision.  And don't try calling her;   she doesn't have a phone.  Please come in. Let me   introduce you to the family.  Um, t-this here is Leila.  And of course, this is Marc--  come here, buddy--   the man of the hour.  -Enchant?, Marc.   -Enchant?, aussi.  Oh, French.   (chuckles)  The language of France.  Okay.   (clears throat, chuckles)  KAY:   And these are our other two  gifted children   Brian and Nicole.  -Enchant?.   -Enchant?.  -Enchant?.   -Enchant?.   -NICOLE: Actually,  I think you can help us.  My brother and I were having   an intellectual debate.  Is there any other kind?   (laughs)  How droll.  As an academic evaluator,   you are uniquely qualified  to settle something for us.  Uh, we don't need   to bother Dr. Walker with...  We could show you   our r?sum?s, drone on  about our commendations, but   let's dismiss the formalities.  You've seen enough.  Decide: who is drawing   whom a bath?  Come again?  Who is drawing whom...  (laughs): Okay.   Why don't, why don't we, uh,  go upstairs and, uh, and change   our clothes... (clears throat)  ...and our personalities?  Okay. So the kids   enchant?d the bed.  I think it's time to pull the   trigger and say you're sorry.  (whispers): Ah, yeah. There's   one problem-- same problem--  -I don't remember him.   -Right.  Okay. Okay, I-I got this.   (clears throat)  So, Dr. Walker,   tell me about yourself.  D-Did you play any sports   in high school?  (chuckles)   No, I was not a sporting man.  The only team I cheered for   was the team of physicians  trying to rectify   my calcium deficiency.  I drank an obscene amount   of milk.  Cool, cool. That seems like   a memorable characteristic,  just a sick dude   chugging milk all the time?  What is this?  No, no, no.   Uh, we're-we're not...  I had my reservations   about tonight.  Now I see you brought me here   only to mock me.  My girlfriend was right.   I shouldn't have come.  I thought you broke up.  This is a new one.  She also has no phone.   I should be going.  No-- Dr. Walker, wait.  I realize now that I was not   a good person in high school.  I feel terrible about the things  I did back then,  and I wish I could apologize  for what I did to you.  But the truth is, I don't   even remember what it was.  Well, I appreciate your candor.  I wish it were only   so easy for me  to forget about   that election speech.  Election speech.  You're Andy Walker.  (high-pitched):   And I owe you an apology.  (regular voice):   Oh.  Would you, um...  excuse me?  Uh, I'm just gonna go help her   for a minute.  (clears throat)  -What is going on?   -I remember Walker.  Senior year, right before   his student council speech,  I slipped a bottle of laxatives   into his prescription soup.  Walker was the kid that dumped   out in front of the school.  I remember that.  They had to replace   the whole stage.  But this is great.   Now you can really apologize.  No, I can't. I will never ever   apologize to that guy.  Well, drink up.  Usually after the second glass,  you're more up to try things   you first said no to.  -Why won't you tell this guy   you're sorry?   -Look,  I feel bad about a lot of stuff   I did back then, but not that.  That was not bullying,  it was standing up for a friend. My only regret  is I didn't use more laxatives.  But I needed to fit   into my prom dress.  -But again...   -The guy was a huge creep.  He had a crush on my friend   Heather, and she just  didn't like him back, so he lied  about her cheating off him  and got her kicked   out of school.  Whoa, that guy did that?  Okay, they might get   the bullying from me,  but they get   the lurking from you.  Yes.  Your mom needs to say   she's sorry to this guy.  But it sounds   like she was right.  She shouldn't have to apologize. Ugh, I have to be a parent   right now, don't I?  Your dad has a point.  What I did was wrong,   and it is never okay  to treat someone like that.  So I should own up to it.  (whispers): Even though I was   right and I don't want to.  And then Neil deGrasse Tyson   said, "Give me some time."  And I said, "What is time?"   and, oh, did we laugh.  Well, I laughed.  He was very far away.  Can I go to bed?  Dr. Walker, I just want to  finish what I was saying before. Oh.  KAY:   I am...  sorry for what I did to you.  It was, uh...  Cruel, childish and unjustified? Those are three things.  And for whatever reasons I  thought I had, I see now that... You did it because   you were jealous  of my success and intelligence.  The important thing   is that Marc is a great kid.  All of my kids are great kids,  and I have done my best to set  a good example for all of them.  Well, at least you have   the self-awareness  to make yourself a cautionary   tale for your children.  Though you must   appreciate the irony.  You, once so powerful   and popular, now reduced  to working at a second-rate   casino, pleading for my help  like a squirrel trapped   in a garden rake.  Okay. Okay, ho--   That is my squirrel.  -Mike, it's fine.   -It is fine.  I graciously accept   your apology.  Justice has been served.  All is right in the world.  You're a dick.  -Leila.   -NICOLE: She's right.  No one can talk   to our mother like that.  Especially not some   pedantic pseudo-intellectual.  Pseudo? I have an IQ of 135.  (both laugh)  I can't believe   you'd admit that.  So, you're just a whole family   full of bullies.  I guess some things   never change.  You should know.  Becoming an educator   is a transparent attempt  to wield power in an environment where you once felt so impotent. What know you of my impotence?  Your words mean nothing.  "Let them speak lewdly of me,   what am I the worse?"  -Sir Thomas More.   -(scoffs)  More like Sir Thomas Snore.  (both laugh)  I'll be going.  Marc, it seems like you're the   only decent one of the bunch.  Wait.  (whispering indistinctly)  (crying softly)  Sir Thomas More   was a damned fool.  (door opens, closes)  What did you say to him?  Just enough.  Again, I am so sorry for all   of the mean things I said  and did to you in high school.  Thanks. It was nice   talking to you, too.  Jerry Weenus accepted   my apology.  Another burned bridge rebuilt--  -And what are you wearing?   -Oh. These?  Well, I figured,   now that we are officially  a bully-free ho ho home,   I am free to be me.  And I can't say   anything about it.  No, you cannot.  You just got to watch me walk.   (chuckles)  Okay, the jeans don't want   to sit. (clears throat)  Announcing entrance.  Sweetie, we are so sorry   about Marlboro.  But don't worry, we are gonna   come up with another plan.  It's okay. I'm going   to apologize to my teacher.  -You are?  -If you could be nice to a jerk  like Dr. Walker for me, I can   be nice to my teacher for you.  It's not his fault   he went to Dartmouth.  (chuckles)  Wow, that is really mature   of you, buddy.  Yeah.  Maybe even like   seventh grade mature.  -Then we'd have two drop-offs.   -Sixth it is.  Hey, jelly bean,   what are you doing?  I'm going to dig   in the backyard.  Oh, y-you planting something?  Sort of. Let's just say   that you won't be seeing  my imaginary friend   around here anymore.  Captioned by   Media Access Group at WGBH
