 [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] What have you done? I'm making a party. But I'm not having a party. I'm having two girls over who aren't expecting a party. When they see this they'll have expectations. I can't live up to expectations. NICHOLAS: Yep. No, you're absolutely right. - I got swept up in it. - You need to undo this. They are on their way.

 I need to undo it, I absolutely have to undo it. - NICHOLAS [OVER PHONE]: Hello? - Hey. I'm sneaking out. I thought you might pop out for a kiss, but I guess it's becoming clear that's not gonna happen. No, don't leave me, help me. I've got party decorations to undo. Won't your sisters feel weird when I just appear? You girls gonna feel weird if Alex just appears? I won't feel anything. How many times do I have to tell you? I think that's a no. Okay. Yeah. You think you did this for me, but you didn't. You did this for you.

 I did it for the compliments. Tellulah is bringing alcohol and I need you to confiscate it. Me? Yes, you just go in her bag and take it. From Tellulah? Yes. But Tellulah's so cool. I don't want her to think I'm not cool. Why do boys always think messy girls are cool? I'm not a boy. You're such a boy. I'm not a boy. Alex, are you coming to the party? Oh, I have to study. What do you mean study? You're... you're a dentist. It's teeth. Teeth. Nobody dies. None of these snacks are keto. Shut up, Barb, you're not keto. Don't listen to her, Barb. You are totes keto, okay? I don't know how to do this. I can't just search their things. Well, I'm not doing it, I'm new here. I'm a bit bloody sick of your excuses. - Hello. - Hey, girls. Hi! Probably don't remember me. I'm Alex. It's so nice to see you. I was at the funeral. Do you remember me? I gave you the bottle of water. Cool. Um... Can I take your bags inside? - Why? - NICHOLAS: Yeah, why, Alex? Why would you take their bags? It's like, this isn't a hotel. GENEVIEVE: I-I need to pee. We know you guys have alcohol. - What? - Yeah. I don't have alcohol in here. [SCOFFS] You can't take that. Peach schnapps. Nothing's changed. It's not mine. Oh, honey. Honey! We don't care that you brought alcohol, like, really, I mean, do we care? Okay, yeah. I mean, teenage drinking, it's... it's bad. - It's fun. - I mean, undeniably fun. Undeni... Gosh. - ALEX: Hmm. It is. - Fun. But... you are not allowed to do it because your brain is still going through several maturation processes... - Cool. - ... which makes it more susceptible to damage from things like peach schnapps. Is that true? Yes, Barb, it's true. I'm an entomologist and he's a dentist, okay? We're authorities on facts. - Mm-hmm. - NICHOLAS: Also... I don't wanna get in trouble by your mum. So... that's it. I thought you were supposed to be cool. - Me? - ALEX: Who told you that? - Yeah, I'm cool. - Your torso's too long. Oh, my God, she's right. She's absolutely right. How did she know that? - I'm all torso. - She doesn't know anything. Okay, can you go now? Want us to go? Where? Anywhere else. Okay. Come on, Alex. Come on, Matilda, let's ride. Sorry I ate all the corn chips on your birthday. NICHOLAS: I've been wearing high-waisted pants because I thought it solved the torso issue, but she... she saw right through me. - Nicholas. - Matilda. I need to get drunk. College is all about drinking, and I need to be prepared. I thought college was all about learning. No, you didn't. Didn't you hear my beautiful speech about teenage drinking? Sometimes I don't listen if things aren't about me. Aw, you two have that in common. I can't get drunk for the first time in front of my new college friends, I'll embarrass myself. I need to get drunk in front of people like you, whose opinions I don't care about. And Alex is a medical professional. NICHOLAS: I don't think so, babe. MATILDA: I also need you to drink with me, because drinking alone is an early warning sign of alcoholism. I can't drink with you. I'm the responsible adult. Please? I never ask for anything. You actually ask me for so much. ♪ But I never ask for anything fun ♪ Okay. Well, that does weaken my resolve. Dad'll never know because he's dead. Okay. Well, that's true. But I just can't. I'm sorry, babe. Alex? You're my only option. I don't think I can. - Can I? - I don't bloody know. Oh. I mean, I'm not so busy. MATILDA: What are you saying? Is that you saying yes? Yeah, let's have a drink. Let's get this white girl wasted! No, no, no. It's just white-girl-wasted. Let's get white... girl wasted. No, no, no. It's just white-girl-wasted. White-girl-wasted. - Yeah. Good. - There. Okay. I looked at my butthole yesterday. You guys ever done that? It's like wild down there. It's wild. Oh, my God, I haven't ever. BARB: Mine's hairy. Is yours hairy? I didn't know they got hairy. How have I never even considered it? Wait, like the actual hole or like the skin around it? Oh, God. I don't know. All of it? Is it supposed to be just one or the other? Wait. Genevieve, you've never looked? It's just never been a good time. How busy are you? The weird thing is, I know what one looks like. How do I know what one looks like, if I never saw my own? I'm interested in how dark it is. Did I see someone else's? Is a baby's dark, or does it get that way from poop? Genevieve, you don't know what you have to offer until you look. I don't think I want to. I don't need to go hunting for more things to feel self-conscious about. Even Barb has looked. There's no way you're gonna let me get through this day without looking at it, are you? [CHUCKLES] Chin-chin. Well, that's that. I can't wear skinny jeans, I can't wear high-waisted. Maybe it's better to just be a regular boy at the bar. Overlooked, out of style. TELLULAH: Hello? Are you doing it? GENEVIEVE: Yes. Hot or not? I feel like it's judging me. No, don't look at my teeth like a dentist. I was a gross child, always running around rubbing sugar into my gums and punching girls. I won't look at your teeth like a dentist. I'll look at your teeth like a lover. - I don't want that either. - Oh, come on. Oh. - How many drinks until I puke? - NICHOLAS: What? I kept hearing girls bragging how they puked at a party and a guy holds their hair. And I wanna do that. But I want you to hold my hair. - I'm touched. - Nobody's puking today. If and Alex I don't puke, I'm certain I will be very unprepared. Wait, why do I have to puke? Because if I vomit alone I'm a loser. Should I? Well, I don't bloody know. I know, I need you to tell me to. Okay. Yes, you should. This is not a good idea, is it? [SIGHS] Yes, it is. Pinky swear we will puke together. Pinky swear. I think it's probably better if I don't look. Chin-chin. ALEX: Chin-chin. We need to turn this party up a notch. Why does everyone keep saying that? This isn't a party. Well, not yet, but when we turn things up a notch, it will be. What does that even mean? Should we look at each other's buttholes? - No! - No. Let's call some boys. Call some boys? I don't know any boys. You really think we don't know any boys? - Do we? - Barb, name a boy we know. Oh, my God, I don't know any boys. We need to turn this up a notch! What does that mean? Hi, Luke, it's Matilda. I've just finished some yoga and now I'm having a drink. I'm so flexible. [GIGGLES] Things are getting lit. Best of wishes. [BEEPS] What's going on over there? Messaging a boy. Ooh. What kind of boy? A Luke kinda boy. NICHOLAS: Why won't you show us a photo? What kind of monster brings up a boy - and doesn't show us a photo? - [PHONE CHIMES] Shut up! He replied! - Oh. - Okay. It's a little early to be hitting the bottle. But it's a respectable Saturday move for sure. He's really dreamy. Like, he is... Does this exist? Is he an avatar? - Sure. - [LAUGHTER] He's so beautiful. I bet if we ever kiss he won't use too much tongue. "If"? I mean when. I'm manifesting. ALEX: Ah, I love peach schnapps. Why don't people drink more schnapps? I'm gonna become a schnapps man, huh? Right, babe? [LAUGHS] I'm so... drunk. You can ask me anything. I'm an open book. I'm the third wheel. [WHIPPED CREAM SQUIRTS] [WHIPPED CREAM SQUIRTS] [WHIPPED CREAM SQUIRTS] I just... I don't understand what you got out of doing that. I was experimenting. Hmm. He still hasn't responded yet. Should I send another message? Nah, nah, nah, nah. Sometimes it's good to play hard to get. You never played hard to get with me. Not with you, no. But have you seen this guy? She's gotta strategize. Hmm. This is the shit. This one's really good, everybody says it gives the best high. Oops. Don't be totally lame. It's super mild. Thought you said it was the best high. It's a quiet high. Just do it. Can I at least get some water? Use the tap. [WATER RUNNING] What do I care? ALEX: Hmm. This is so cozy. Mm-hmm. [LINE RINGING] What are you doing? Calling Luke. - [GASPS] What? No. - No, no, no, no, no. - No? Should I not? - Hang up. Hang up. - Luke [OVER PHONE]: Hello? - It's too late! Oh, God. - Matilda? - No. Nicholas told me to call you, but then he changed his mind. Oh. Okay. - Too-da-loo. - [CELL PHONE CHIMES] ALEX: Oh, honey. [ALEX CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [LAUGHTER] I'm having a good time. NICHOLAS: Hmm. [SOFTLY]: I think I love you. Hello. [WHISPERING]: It's just me and you against the world. My mom found out the other day my dad has a secret bank account. She was really mad. She... she really scares me sometimes. Linda is intense. She ever hit you? Oh, my God, Tellulah, stop! Do you think Linda's a secret dominatrix? Why would you say that? Why do people say anything? 'Cause I thought it, so I said it. [GROANS] So you guys both hate my mom? Honestly, I cannot think about Linda for another second, she's a mess. We definitely don't hate your mom. I hate her. Oh, my God, this is the best thing I've ever tasted. [BARB GROANS] You don't look so good. Are you sure you're okay? I-I don't look good? Am I pale? I-I don't feel good. My mouth's lagging. Why can't my mouth keep up? I don't like feeling out of control. I-I'm getting Nicholas. Stop. You're not getting Nicholas. Something really bad could happen to her. - But it won't. - It could. - But it won't. - It might. Her mom will kill her, literally. She's fine. She just needs some water. I don't wanna risk it. Stop being a little bitch. She's fine. "A little bitch"? - The littlest. - No, no! No parents! Let's just buckle in and ride it out. I'm sorry. What do you have to be sorry about? I ruined your day. You didn't ruin our day. Tonight could've been gay romantic, but instead you two have to babysit me. Hey. We love hanging out with you. - Yeah. - MATILDA: I'm always a burden! I thought it would be okay because I'm way more adaptive than other people with autism, but recently I just don't understand what I'm... I don't know how to help. Alex, do you know how to stop the sadness? I just don't understand. What's being a teenager? What's autism? What's Dad dying? It's ha... [CHOKING] [RETCHING] - [VOMITS] - Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, that's about right. Alex, I need you... to vomit with me. I don't know if I'm ready to vomit. I miss Dad. I miss Dad so much, and I cry in the closet all the time. You're crying in the closet? Honey! Why are you crying in the closet? Here, I'm gonna go try. Because I didn't want you to hear me! I was being self-sufficient! Alex! Vomit with me! Okay. A promise is a promise! - [RETCHES FORCEFULLY] - Honey, if you're gonna do that, at least come and cry in my closet. - Alex! - I'm trying. I'm trying. - Well, try harder. - [COUGHS] This is insane. I have no gag reflex. That was my thing. [VOMITING] Thanks, baby. Sober you and your sober memories. Yeah, I'm never gonna forget. [GROANS] I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I'll... I'll get back on track and I'll go to college next year and I won't be a burden anymore. Aw, honey, I'm... I'm sorry you feel that way. This is kinda like a drinking milestone, right? - Drunk crying. - Yeah. Absolutely. You could check it off the list. Nicholas, I need you. More than these guys? Barb's overdosed. My phone. My phone. - Honey, we'll be back. - MATILDA: Mm-hmm. OPERATOR [OVER PHONE]: 911, what's your emergency? I don't know yet. Hey, where's the bottle of the medication you took? Tellulah, where is it? NICHOLAS: Just one more second. How much did you take? Ju-just one. [SIGHS] Okay, tell them you don't need them. Oh, we don't need you. There's been a mistake. Sorry. Please don't be mad. What's going on? It's blood pressure medication. She's not overdosing, she's just high on panic. Take a seat. Go on, on the bed. Take a seat. So, the good news is that, Barb, you're okay. You just need some water and perhaps a bit of toast. Now, did I... make a mistake by not talking to the three of you about... how taking random prescription drugs is dangerous? Was it foolish of me to assume that you already knew that? - I don't think so. - [GIRLS MUTTERING] No. I didn't wanna take them. I know, Barb. I know. So, I think what I'd like, is for the three of you to acknowledge that you were faking being high. Tellulah? Tell me the truth, were you faking being high? No, I was high. Tellulah, would you like me to call your mother and ask her if she thinks you were faking being high? Fine. Chin up. Good. Fine, I was faking being high. NICHOLAS: Genevieve? I was faking being high. Barb? I was faking being high. Okay. Well... [SIGHS] This is embarrassing. Isn't it? Let's just sit here and think about how embarrassing this is. [SIGHS] What I'm gonna do now is... I'm gonna go. I'm gonna close the door. And I'm never gonna mention this again. [DOOR OPENS] I have something to give you. Um, I'm gonna warn you, it's very touching, okay? Like, it's gonna be a moment. Dad left this for me to give to you, uh, yeah... I didn't give it to you earlier 'cause I thought it might wobble you. Did Dad leave me a present for my birthday? NICHOLAS: He sure did. - Well, that's exciting. - NICHOLAS: Mm-hmm. Uh, it was your mum's. I know. I love it. Do you, though? 'Cause I sorta think... whilst the sentimentality is huge and very sweet, the actual ring is, um... Well, it's not your aesthetic. And I hope this might be a way for you to wear it without people, like... actually having to see it. Thank you.
