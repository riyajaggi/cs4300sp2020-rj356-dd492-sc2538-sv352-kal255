 Wait… Good morning. -Hello. Rafting. Have you been shopping? I'll meet our new chief. What does he want? I'll anyway out and celebrate tonight. Family dinner. So maybe I can borrow your jacket? I'm a little more careful who I dress me up. Good luck. Hell, what tough it was. First half, completely static. It was like watching someone do the dishes. Made token, exactly the same pace throughout. Second Half same.

 And then ages most unexciting ultimately on with a microscopically small hint to energy in the final minutes. I'm sorry to go on like this. I get so upset by boring football… I want to terminate me. With immediate effect, if possible. I haven't talked to my colleagues about it so I'd be grateful if it could stay between us. Why? I just see no point with this anymore. Sorry. You have no anxiety, huh? -No, you know what! "What should I do with the rest of my life?" There are probably some who are dissatisfied who feel that way. I just think it'll be nice. I understand that it sounds strange for someone who's new, but it's true.

 Imagine being in the country more, fix with the cottage, take care of the grandchild… What we eat today? -Decide you, I'm not hungry. You must eat if you're going to be big and strong so you can chase real criminals. It's the violence you want, huh? What's the attraction there? Don't know, I've always thought that that's where you can do something. Sorry, I didn't mean that. -It's quiet. The traffic wasn't there I dreamed of as a new, either. Murder's the most serious offense. I don't think a police officer who works with it can wake up in the morning and think that it's useless. And then I think I'd fit well. The sinners don't seem to have woken up. Or…? It's 60. I'll take it. Come! But please friend, now you surely give you. No, you should call in this. 7042 here. We're behind a gray Peugeot or Ford as control passed without stopping. Taken. Do you think we put up a HR from Vehicle Stockholm? He has stopped. We have him. -Like good that he may blow too. Good. Then you come back with further action. Over and out. He's armed. Out with it now! -What? I met Hedvall in the dining room. He was sour. Was there fights? No, no. -Really? For then I want to be with. With luck, he's shit on your hands as peace and are out before Christmas. Bergman. You know as well as I if you have some dirt on your hands so are you not out from this house. You get promoted! Hell! Shooting in Bromma. Two policemen. Who is she? -Britt Rivera. Highway patrol on Söderort. Would like to retire. And colleague? -Young guy, hit in the shoulder. Alone perpetrator? It seems so. No one saw that he had company. Do we have a description? Adult male, medium height, was driving a silver Ford Mondeo… Caught in the report? -Yes, but not as much. She was hit by four shots. Here, here, here and here. Can you determine if there is surveillance cameras around? Oskar, check if it has come alarm on burglary and robbery last night or this morning, and escapes from prisons. Take a nationwide alert on what we have. - Steinar, take colleague? So are you with me before this thing is out there everywhere. Your wife Britt… She's dead. She's been shot. Is she dead…? -Yes. -Shot? By who? -There we don't know. But I promise that we'll do everything in our power to find out. If there are some who would need to know about this… …so it would be good if you contacted them before they hear it on the news or see it on TV… Can you it? We've removed the bullet sitting pretty superficial. But he's lost a lot of blood. He should rest before you… It's very important that I can talk to him directly. I'd rather take your blood pressure first. A short while only. Thank you. Hey. How is it? How did he look? I don't know… You didn't see him? -Sorry. Everything went so fast, you know… Did you see the number on the car? No, I didn't… You know, we were behind him quite some time, but… But I remember… You know, I tried. Sorry, it went so fast. Yes, hello? We've received images from a surveillance camera. Okay. Well, hello. - I'll be back. The call came in to the monitoring center 08.31 from the man who stopped next door. He was fast, then it had just happened. Where's the witness. This's where it happens, but I can't fucking see it. Well, wait… Come on… There. -MND 767. Send it out everywhere. Add it to the banns. I check the owner. -Okay, that bastard… Let's see now. Back. Stop. And closer. Even closer. What the hell? Is this the only camera? -Only in the neighborhood. Examine all cameras within a radius of two kilometers. The car's owned by a Peter Henning, Draws road in Bromma. Police! Ready! If it continues at this pace I need reinforcements. When he died? -It'll ask for the right medicine. Do you think he had time to kill police officers today? As I said was. It seems Peter Henning anyway. Where have Ayda got? He was born -74, Swedish teacher and the history divorced, unpunished and no debt. He seems to have known the who shot him. He has all the same let him voluntarily. Yes? Hello! Oskar Bergman called I, from the police. I just sat on the coffee. Come in. I'm just asking questions. -Baked I have too. It goes pretty fast. -Come come! Don't be shy now. Not so bad, huh? -No, delicious. I doubles the butter. Otherwise it dry, and that one can't. No, exactly. That said, we wonder if you might've sett or heard anything unusual in the house this morning. What would it be, then? Yes, I don't know. That's why I ask. What happened? It's been a bit rowdy in the flat at the top. Yikes, then! So we were wondering if you might've seen someone stranger in the area outside house, in the stairwell. Or if you've heard anything. No, but I was hoovering the all morning. Just. Did you know… do you know who live top, Peter Henning? He's not very pleasant. How much I can say. I've been up and told, because he plays so loud music. And when he's not been pleasant. Otherwise, I never talked to him. I haven't had any desire. Do you know if anyone's visited him? Yes, besides his children then. Children? I've never seen him with some children. There I'd remembered. It's my great sorrow that I never got any grandchildren. But great love, there are I've experienced in all cases. And I'm so grateful! -How nice. Wait, you'll see. Here I have in my album. They are my path. Have you seen a more handsome man in your entire life? No. Do you recognize this man? Look carefully, please. I don't think so. Where is he? I don't know. Can you see if he looks like? Sorry, but I think that he was brighter. Who is it? There are car owners. I know it's hard, but we need a description. I want us to go through everything that happened from the beginning. Did you see immediately that he was driving too fast? Yes, and he didn't stop when we waved him in. So we jumped in the car and drove after. I really tried to see him, but I saw nothing. I just saw that he had a cap on the rear-view mirror. Do you remember how it looked? -Unfortunately. Color? Icons? Letters? As he stayed so said Britt that he'd blow. Then it happened instantly. That he shot. Or first said Britt that he had a weapon and then so he shot. That's probably why I don't had time to see anything, because I crawled… Because I crouched in the seat. That's when I knew it burnt to the shoulder. I thought he'd arrive, that he'd continue shooting. Did he say something? Did you hear his voice? No, that is… No, no. Everything went so fast. I saw him maximum of a few seconds only. So it may've been more in the car? You don't know if it was more? Sorry. Sorry, but I have to… Ahead. The person we seek is of average height, average build. He has a bright more than a dark appearance. Probably between 30 and 40 years. Traveling in a stolen car: A silver Ford Mondeo with registration MND 767 Peter Henning's neither called or received any calls late yesterday evening at 19:48 when he phoned a local pizzeria which consistent with what we found in his garbage. Ayda, you can go through that properly? Something more? -Children, But that doesn't seem to live there. None of the neighbors had someone contact him. They had nothing to tell you about something possible visit either. And no one heard anything. -Strange. I've lived in one of those houses. There was extremely responsive. This is quite a high average age. Obviously he has been visited by anyone in any case. They found several fingerprints in apartment, but they got no hits. And forensic are pretty sure that he died before the Britt Rivera. When do we know about the gun? The bullets matches several models. How many? -We know only that it's a gun. Can't get data from 'register? We have to look for a connection between Henning and the offender. Nothing indicates something private regarding the police. It wasn't even a fraction. Maybe he just got stressed out of having them behind after murder of Henning. Panicked. But he was icy enough running around the murder victim's car. Yes, or amateurish. We need to look at Henning to understand what it is for the offender. How does he? What does he want? Does he have more on their list? Are we even sure that he was alone in the car? Henning lost custody of children in divorce three years ago. It takes more than that it is an uninterested father. We speak with exfrun. You and Peter Henning divorced three years ago, huh? Yes. I don't know what to say. There… It feels completely unreal. Was that a burglary or…? -Not as it looks. It seems rather as if he felt the who shot him. What? When did you last contact? It must be safe two, three months ago. Or more. It was in the February Williams on our son's birthday. So you weren't particularly close contact? Did you know anything about his visitation? I'm not too familiar with in his life anymore. No. But you have still children together? Yes, but I have custody. Yes, but he's well entitled to meet them sometimes? Yes, but the children themselves haven't been so interested. They haven't wanted…. I haven't exactly tried persuade them, if you say so. Sorry, you can't get a cup of coffee or something? Sure, absolutely. -Can we just…? Yes. - Would you excuse us just one minute? What is it? Incredibly bad timing, but I has a doctor's appointment in 20 minutes. I've already booked twice. I can't miss now. You're not ill, Oskar? -No, I… What? -No it's OK. It's advice. Partner therapy. It's me and Petra. We're trying to see… …if we can get back together. Yes. Go away only. But hurry back. Absolutely, I will as soon as I can. So there. How is it that you has sole custody of the children? Yes, Peter was well little problem with his temper. He was… violent. Both to me and to the children. But after divorce so he was completely… Then he'd prove the amazing man he was. He probably thought I'd change me, but it was a bit late. What happened? -He took to end. And I went on and so. So you met a new man? -Yes exactly. As you still with? -We don't live together, but… Where's this now? -I don't know. He works well. I can't find him. -Does he not know it happened? What are his relations to your ex-husband? Micke has nothing to do here. Mike… Mike may also have problems with his temper. No, he's not. He has a gun in the bag. No, I think not. Get dressed so you don't get cold. …was shot but survived with minor injuries. Other fatal victim is a civilian. The candidate is of average height, average build. He has more light than a dark appearance. 30-40 years old. He was when he was seen wearing jeans black jacket and cap, blue or black. I haven't had contact with Peter on forever and I… I don't know why you want to meet a personal as at all not even know him. I don't know if it's escaped dig but besides the murder of your ex-husband so also a police killed. Probably the same offender who's at the foot and armed, so I requires that you cooperate. And don't you think so you commit a crime. Do you understand? So, where's he somewhere? I want to meet the children. I have to tell the kids. They're in school. No problem, we can ensure that they'll hit if you give me Mike's full name, address and telephone number. Paula, where's he somewhere? Michael Axberg is 38 years old. Have a five year old notification of abuse, the prosecution was discontinued. Several tours with both Tax Authority and the Swedish Enforcement Authority. Thank you. Police! Police! Course! Here's it! Nothing? -No nothing. Unfortunately. Okay, good. What do we do? -Call Martin. No. Nothing. We need his home address. Where! Police! Ouch! Are you Mikael Axberg? -Yes. Take it easy! I've never done anything like this before, I promise. I didn't know what the hell I'd do just. Yes, I do that I get disqualifications for this. What the hell are you talking about? -What? Where were you this morning between seven and ten? Answer the question! -I was at home. Is there anyone who can prove it? What? Hey. Can I help you? I need a costume. -Costume? Yes, hang on. These models works for both celebration and jobs. Do you know what color you want? Dark or light? Blue. -Do you know what your size? 50? 48 maybe. Awesome. Will there be a party today? Will you go to a party? Yes. -How fun. Need shirt? White perhaps? -Yes. And tie too. Tie too? Is the student receiving? Or conclusion one might say. -Yes. Good! Are gentle and hear you. We're content where we get a little time in between. And sing as you did now, will all be overjoyed. And Minna and Amina… Do you want to stop and run through your song so there is time. Or Is it? -The sitting. Or what? -Yes. Good, then sits. Remember that you go in immediately after the poem. Yes, okay. Check here. Hello? Hi, it's dad here. How are you? It's okay. Okay. Good. You, it's a very special day here today. I don't know if I have time for dinner. So clear. Unexpectedly. Don't say that. Listen to me, Lina. I want to come. Okay, but will you? I'll do what I can. Well. Okay. I do what I can. Have there. Bye. So, I… I think this is very difficult. Take the time you need. I think he was narrower, thinner as well. But I'm not sure. Ooops! Sorry. Sorry. Oh, look! Neat. So tie you fix yourself? It's not all do. Most people say nothing, so are the with something bloody tangle ago. Fine. You might be a little bigger in his jacket. What do you think? Should I get one? So, huh… what the hell's this? There's a misunderstanding. I'd be interrogated about my business. There'll be, but not of us. We want to ask about other things. What? Your girlfriend's ex-husband was murdered in the morning. And after a policeman. What then? Do you think that I…? -I don't know. Where's Paula? I want to meet her. I don't believe this. First I want to know where was the between seven and nine in the morning. I've said it already. I was at home. Can anyone prove it, we can write off you as the prime suspect immediately. Haven't you, I intend to continue to issue if you're greeted at at the home of Peter Henning. This's not fucking true… Okay. I wasn't at home. But I haven't murdered anyone. I don't even know where he lives. Where were you? In a girl. I… I was out yesterday. I took some glass it was late and so I went not home. And not to your girlfriend either? No… Where do we want the name, phone number and address of this girl. Then I go and talk with… Isabelle. Thank you. Why, you again? You haven't changed your mind? Thank you. You didn't have it. I was just doing my job. Do you drink coffee with me? No, we can't. Unfortunately. But thank you for the flowers. It was really very nice. There'll görbra, this. You may have a beautiful party. Good luck. Hey. -Hello. How did it go with that…? -Parterapin? We'll see. None on Michael Axbergs office related to Henning. No weapons, no mobile so far and no car keys to someone Ford. However, we've been here some papers and his computer. I was going to start going through it. -Good, Do it. Some tips? -No, nothing serious. Most wacky ice. Isabelle in Årsta confirm that he was there until nine o'clock. But it can be so that she protects him. He may well have sent someone else too. We'll keep him for a while. How do we do with exfrun? She has kids here now. We retain her too. Jenny Boden. It's possible weapons. I took a list of all of Stockholm as licensed in Sanaa. Oh, my God… United States of fucking Sweden! I've marked the born after 1970. Thank you. The fingerprints of Henning's apartment, they're his. Can you explain why you lied to us? Why did you say you didn't even know Peter Henning lived? Did you not get the girl? Did she not know I was there? In that case, she's lying. -Answer the question. Have you been there today? No. Okay, I've been there but it was a while. Along with Paula. She wanted to get him to back off a little. He was on the kids. I'd like to support to show that it was serious. That it was hard for her. For her? And for you. Mostly for her. -And when was this? I don't know. A month ago. Why didn't you say it right? I thought it was bad Paula and the kids. Martin, can I…? Get out. I recognized the car my mom has the same one. When was this? -At eight. Traded he? -Yes, a coffee and a Dajm. Did he pay with a card? -No, in cash. But I have the receipt. Did he say something? Did you talk to him? No, nothing besides themselves… Yes, when he'd pay then. This is the first camera. 8.11. Then it by Henning and before police. 20 minutes before. -Stay there. There he is. Continue. That's not Michael Axberg. No. The police have no trace those who shot two traffic policemen of which one died. According to witnesses disappeared perpetrator in a silver Ford of this model. How says Mats Hedvall, Head of Länskriminalens violence root. He was traveling in a stolen car, a silver Ford Mondeo with registration MND 767. We want to emphasize that we're not looking after the owner of the car. And to all observations of interest. No, we don't know how long it may've been. But maybe we should check out car theft in this part of town. Okay. -On some way he took on. If he isn't and press somewhere. It's a gamble, but in his place wouldn't I like to take the subway. But… Not here we stood? What? I don't really know. Sorry, I just remember that he had cap and hoodie. You have a visitor. Excuse me just a moment. You pour it out after all! -So, you! Cheers! Shit, What scared I was! -Excuse me. Here, do you want? -No thanks. "No thanks, I'm wacko and may not drink for my caregiver." "And for that I am so damn good looking too!" Nämen… Where did you go? -What do you mean? We'd eat lunch. -Sorry, I forgot about it. You see, it's insanely messy here right now. Are you working with the police shooting? -Yes. I heard on the radio. -Yes… You, this is not a good day to be out on the town. It would be nice if you took a taxi home and phoned William and asked him to do the same. It would be nice if you did it. You lead the group. Say you work from here. It doesn't work that way. Not at your work either. It's not the same. My colleagues won't be murdered. It'll be good, this. -It can't, you know. I'll tell you something. You won't have to worry for me in the future. Because I have… I've resigned. -What?! Is that true? -Yes. When then? -Yesterday. But congratulations! It's incredible! That you do it now when you still have the energy stuff and not completely senile or… Yes, but… Do you know how much you have to look forward to? Now we can do hiking trip to Italy as you've talked so much about. Can you come? - Hey, Steinar. Excuse. Inger. Pick up William as we talk later. I'll call. Okay? Puss. This is Krister, investigator on economic crime. He believes that our man at the gas station is extremely similar to one at his gym. Yes, I think he works there. I'm not entirely sure, but he's very similar in all cases. Good, thanks. Where's your daughter? And she was worried about her father? It should really be a little happy. I'm too. What about your daughter Lisa? Lina. Well, she is little more on track now. Good to hear. She's moved so now I'm teenage father seriously. Slightest misstep and you're out in the cold again. Tonight we celebrate that she almost remained at the school throughout the semester. If we can sort this out then. Large cleaning? -Yes. It's good there. You should clean up after themselves, you. Yes, Lina… It did people of you also to the end. It doesn't feel so bad, huh? Thought so. How. Ten to. There's only one set left. Stretch properly. Ooops! Hello hello. Take off your shoes, please.

Nämen… She lives in the alternative, don't know Stefan Mattson. She only met him when she got the keys and it was over two years ago. She doesn't recognize him at the pictures, but she's shocked… Yes, where you come and told me earlier… I was a bit taken by surprise there, least. It doesn't feel like we could… We may well talk about it? -Not today, I hope. When this is over. I've thought this through very carefully, just so you know. I send the form by internal mail later in the day. I hear you, but we can talk about it in peace? Martin. Come on. I checked her rent payments, and look! They go to an R Stefan Mattson.

I haven't had the time. It'll be fine. -Do you think? Yes… We hope with otherwise we'd not be able to hold on. One day it'll be clear enough. I'm going away soon, but… Do you want to come in?

But you'd done very good food. Indian. Yes… Imagine that you remember it. I remember everything. I sat on the chair and looked at the tree there. I had much time to watch out. You were probably the only one who said something to me the whole evening. And everyone'd say something good and something bad from the past year. It was Peter's idea. -God… I told him about the handball team. When I'd take it bad had all gone. It was just Peter who remained… …To see how hard it was. I had no real track because I most… …running around. I was so surprised. I thought we had another contact. Yes, but that we had. I thought that with. But you said nothing.

Check if he and Peter Henning has worked at the same school. You remember him then? -Yes I do. How was he? -On the interview? Yes, he was eager. But he seemed pretty sure. Where he intimidating or aggressive? -Absolutely not. I liked him. But I wondered if he'd be able of having so large groups because he hadn't felt… strong enough. Was that why he didn't get the job? -No. He had better credentials than most seeking here. I doubted for something not felt a hundred. And when I talked to last employer I realized he was right… inappropriate. Yes, we check course all of the applicant's references. And why was he inappropriate? I understand that you're disappointed. You have every right to be there. I've thought to hear from me several times, but… Why did you write on that list? Yes… The other doesn't surprise me, they did as the headmaster said. But you believed that… I said no first. I said that I wasn't going to write on. When I was called to a meeting with the principal and where… There, I was persuaded. He talked about the atmosphere of the school, that everyone was afraid. Parents who called and all the needed peace and quiet. I didn't dare do otherwise. I'm really sorry about it, Stefan. And I never thought of that. -On what? You know what I mean. -Saw it. I know you were… I know you were very careful with the rules. You'd never go to the girls' locker room. Especially not if they keep on switching on. And even less to try something… It's quite… It wasn't the first time it was drama in the class either. I wanted to be there. I hadn't received if I hadn't written on. Or maybe, but then I had… I'd become so ostracized that I'd to stop anyway. Thank you. -Sorry… Sorry. Sorry, but I have to make myself in order. I'm already late. But I love to be seen and talk again if you want. Can I use the bathroom before I go? Yes, of course. The news of the past about the shootings in western Stockholm.

All flesh is grass and the flowers die. And time all the while. Only word of the Lord endureth. What the hell? They're in the church. It's fully under way there now. What church? Get out of here. Go home. The weight he pulls down How it clings. Hard to be uncertain, afraid… Police! Drop the gun! -Dad? Drop it! Drop the gun, Stefan! You don't want this, Stefan! You don't wanna hurt more people in here. Put the gun down, Stefan. I don't think you've done what you're accused of. You can obtain redress. All here can know that you're innocent. That's what you want? Then you need to put down the weapon and not hurt more people here. Put the gun down now. And let all go from here in peace. Good. No, no, no! We did everything we could, Martin. Why is it not enough? Here. Take a little now. Bowl. -Cheers. And you get nothing. -A little I guess I can get? I could've bought alcohol… So everyone gets to drink champagne, but I water? Nämen… -Hey, Dad! What's this? -What does it look like? We must celebrate that you should stop, right? I'm feeling just a little… -You have to eat. Hair. Cheers. -Cheers. Yes… Cheers, then. God's peace in the cottage. Will there tasting menu or a three-course? Well, you… You throw in the towel now, then? Yes. -Over and out. Yes… You do this right, Martin. You're not young anymore. No. No, but seriously… Martin, have you thought about which potential as you and I together? Damn, we could open a casino. Or whatever, that is. It'll be good, you. It'll be damn good, Martin. I'll tell you. It'll be fine. I feel it in here. You know you have my full support of what you plan to do. And I know that I have yours. -Yes, you do. It'll be damn good, Martin.
