Moreover, he goes on crutches. How long was he there? He arrived there after 23:00. He has not seen any get in or out. Technical says that tire tracks in forest matches the Fiat outside. Then maybe there is a connection. Could it be drug related? Internal disputes? No drug has ever heard of neither Ibrahim or Festservice. What if there is something in it Janne says? That there are links to an Islamist networks? We know too little. Go through the material. -I'm Going to forensic. -Martin, You have a minute? Yes, the way you, Martin.

Extinguishes for you, okay? Martin! Can you look at a thing? -This Is Ulla Nilsson's 60th anniversary. -Should I know who it is? The proceeds from this party are entered as 63 000. Unless this is whipped cream cocaine, so ... -Where Are you getting? I rang Ulla. She paid 4200 SEK. She has not seen anybody invoice at 63 000th Classical money laundering.

Ibrahim had a calendar which is pretty empty. He has written a hit with the imam. -Oskar, You can take it? Sure. Generator man is doomed for assault, twice. Both against persons with a foreign background. Thank you. Thank you. He has knocked-out teeth. It may have occurred during a fight. But if you look at the back teeth ... I just want to have confirmed ... What impetuous you are. I keep a lecture, you just want answers. Your lecture is safe terribly interesting ... It says you can safely to all pathologists. He has probably died of this stab in the back. Murder, that is. Good, thank you. Needless murder. He was dying. The stomach was full of cancer who had had killed him for half a year. Unless heart had stopped previously. Traces of three attacks. -Star It in his journal? He refrained cancer treatment. The heart is not recorded. Typically men your age. Good man untangles himself. -Takes You care about you, Martin? -Yes, I think I do. I exercise ... walking, try to eat healthy. A glass of wine now and then said to be good for the heart ... Sorry I asked. It's just my job, I guess. Life is going on while send tissue samples to SKL. Now I will not be like that. It's ours. Yes. -Ibrahim Khayed, you knew him. What do you mean, "knew"? He has been murdered. -Murdered? I knew he was sick and had not long to live. -What Were your contacts? He was worried about the disease. He had thoughts of death and wanted to ease his conscience. -More I can not say. Why not? Just as priests I've sworn to secrecy. As a citizen, you have a duty To help us enforce the law. My duty to God is greater. Thank you. Is that Thomas Engberg? -Yes. Martin Beck Police. Hello. What can I do for you? -You Have a dark gray Toyota. -ASF 445th -Then We'll see. Yes, it is ours. Who run it? Different, we have several cars by staff. Do you know who drove it last Tuesday? -We For no log. It only takes the keys in the cabinet. Why do you ask? Excuse me. - Hello, yes? I will. - I apologize. This car was seen near a company called Festservice. That I know of. The owner's Ibrahim Khayed, Do you know who that is? I meet a lot of people, but not offhand. -Thank You so long, we might hear. -It's Just call. Fingerprints on Festservice belongs to this guy. Jamil Dabajev, 27-year-old Chechens. And fingerprints? He tried to get into Poland in 2007. When was the picture and fingerprints. He has neither residence or asylum. I gives me the hell that our eminent Head ring SAPO. 100 bucks. You. Hey. You may not squeezing the fruit. You may not squeezing the fruit. Do you have money? Money? No, you're paying over there at checkout. We have a prime suspect the murder of Ibrahim Khayed. And the trenched? -It Goes slower. -Do We if that's even a murder? -Not Quite safe. Do you know Tobias? -No. -Martin Beck. -Tobias Helm. Security Police. I took the liberty to call SAPO. Jamil Dabajev available on a Russian terrorist list late in 2008. Someone suspect the terrorist activities. Yes, he who had the room opposite Khayeds. But he seems pretty conspiratorially laid. We have looked at the money laundering process. Khayed sent money to an account in the Sudan. He also had contact with the imam in Fittja. It may be that he was a pious Muslim. On the other hand, he is murdered. If you add money laundering, Chechen, Khayed and imamen- -As can be an assignment that has gone awry. -Khayed Might want to jump off. -A Terrorist cell has imploded. Do you know what the target of a terrorist cell could be? We have noticed the escalating activity and have inserted extrastyrkor- -the government offices and embassies. We see if the prosecutor can obtain a request for accessory to murder. Or an ad because he is here illegally. Our reconnaissance case of a murder, we can be of assistance so ... For our part, you are welcome to reassure you. We put him in the system and see what we intercepts. We continue to work in parallel with you. It is desirable to co- in the event of operational action. -Make Sure to find that Chechen. -Jamil Dabajev. If he is still in Sweden. -Barnet Will resemble a pear. -You Resembles a pear. Jamil. A policeman came to work today. Why that? I do not know. The very suspicion of a terrorist cell makes the situation even sharper. The emphasis is on finding Jamil Dabajev. He is used to move across borders and may have committed murder. Talk to the border police, Aliens Division. Turn over every stone. Run him the Migration Board's all registers. Take a new turn with the witnesses now that we have a picture. I Do not know, hard to tell the difference. Because They look alike everybody? Some have beards and big noses. The women do not know how they look. When did you come here on a Tuesday night? I was here a little over 23:00. Should you no question about my assault convictions? I fought back. They tried to steal my stuff. I defended what was mine. I do this work you do. We are busy to defend the country against them. I'm so fucking tired of people blame their Skitliv on someone else. -Ligg There and shut up. I'll report you. Because you fell on your ass? Are you going to the club today too? No, do not shoot! -It's Uncharged. And with essential part separated from the weapon. Oops. I retain these. Want proof? No. Ahmed! Get in. Money. You can not stay in Sweden. You must leave the country. No. I can not. I have to make money. Everyone at home, trust me. They paid my trip here. I can not. Remember what happened to Ibrahim. Excuse me, are you, Martin Beck? -Yes. They said it was you one would talk to. How can I help you? -That Does not come from os. -It Does not matter. It's two steps forward, one step back. What did you talk about? -A Police asked if Ibrahim. What he had said to me. Ibrahim said that he had cheated and betrayed. That he is a murderer and that many would die. He said possibly not know how? -No. But he mentioned a name. Yuri. He wrote ugly. -Do You contents? No, it's a letter. Ammonium nitrate. "God will give to those who believe a upright life and full reward. " "He's not the unjust friend." -Is The Quran? -Do It. "You decide." Sounds threatening. "The man I want to tell you about named Yuri. " The passport is a Yuri. What is this thing? A letter has not been sent. Peter Norman, Trefast. I have something in Trefast here. -It's Drawings from Trefast. -The construction company? They own properties as well. I looked up Khayeds order. Detergents and Chemicals possible to manufacture explosives off. We found a letter. Yuri. Is he someone else in the material? We have a passport with that name. Done in Kazakhstan. He looks like the dead in the woods. Try to get more of him. I try to keep track of which activities available at Trefast. Find someone on Trefast we can talk with who has an eye on staff. Since I do not know who Ibrahim is I have no idea. Why has he drawings of our premises? -If You would guess? -No Idea. Is there a threat we need to know. We will contact you if there is something you need to know. Or if it's something we wonder about. We need drawings of your real estate and construction. I ask them at the office Send everywhere you need. -What Are your duties? -I Procure staffing. I do not employ staff. We have suppliers even when it comes to people. Whim. 68 360 SEK. The same account? -Nothing Message? -No. "Hello. Hello?" "Who is it?" "Ahmed, is that you?" "Ahmed?" Would not you like it there? Then I'll take it. But Inger, now that you've fixed in the hospital ... -Are You really take on more? Are you going to say. There are a few evenings a month. I could do more. You can not imagine how many undocumented who do not have access to care. -Everyone Is entitled to ... -Emergency Care, Yes. But how many go to the health center if they risk being expelled? -Where Do you keep house somewhere? I can not say it to you. Many of them are afraid of the police. Is not it good? -Hey. Are you also into this? -On What? What are you doing here? We talked with Engberg if a suicide. Witnesses recognized him as a cleaner for Adamantum. Come ye up to something? He denies knowledge. It was in the middle of the night. It was not a workplace accident. -You Think about suicide? -Nothing Suggest otherwise. You then? We are just at the edge of an investigation. Oh well. I'm sending over a bunch that takes care of it. Absolutely. What was it this time? Maybe it's your reply. Is that your car again? No, now we are looking for a person. You meet a lot of people so I was going to ask if you possibly- -Do again that man? -Never Seen. What's his name? -Jamil Dabajev. He is the Chechens. Can I keep the picture I can ask around. We keep it a little for ourselves for a while. Good luck, then. -I Go, okay? -Sure. Wait, wait! You're Russian? I'm from Chechnya. Do you know an Jamil Dabajev? No, I do not feel any Jamil. The amount that is ordered insufficient to an explosive device. But with threatening letter and drawings there is more substance. Why would they threaten Trefast? Why blow up a bomb on a street? I have found the delivery address cleaning agent. You and Tomstad go there and take a look. But do not go into. Is that clear, Tomstad? What? Yes, yes. Sure. Come on. What is it? Who is it? -Thomas, My boss. I do not want you working there more. I do not like it. Jamil, what is it? Today there came a police to work again.

How so? -Asthma? -Psychoanalysis prophylactic. Prior to giving birth. There are four kinds of respirations depending on what phase you are in. All right. You do not think women can do it themselves? Breathe? Giving birth? She can do it safely, I'm more worried about me. -Go Not there, then. -Of Course I have to go there. I want to be there. I think that it will be a nice experience. : Fine experience? -Yes. What, you should eat the umbilical cord? Yes, yes, it will probably be fine. -Now It happens something. -At last. Martin!
