 I was just about to say Ray Reardon. You're putting me off! How am I putting you off? - Greek mythology. - I'm only reading the questions out. Greek mythology, come on. NANA: Are you sure it was that one? The barman? JANICE: Yeah. That one serving the drinks now. - What a waste. - Doesn't look queer. MICK: Well, he don't leave his handbag on the bar in case it gets wet. And you caught him with one of them proper queer fellas? Yeah. What were they doing? I don't know. I couldn't see properly, it was dark. Well, I think it's disgusting. Was he bumming him?

 Do you mind? I've got a mouthful of nuts. Hey, that's probably what the barman said. “Troy! Come and join us. - Hiya. - Gavin not down yet? - No, he's not coming down. Oh. Everything okay? Not really. We had a bit of a row last night. That'll be the heat. The heat and unlimited alcohol does strange things to people. Last year Jacqueline punched me in the face after a game of gin rummy. Accused me of cheating. Now, normally she wouldn't say boo to a goose, would you? Oh, no. You see, people do strange things on holiday. I bet you can't even remember what the argument was about, can you? - Well.. - Now, you stay here and I'll go and get him. It's quiz night tonight and we need both of you on our team. - What number are you? - Twenty-two. Okay. See you at lunch time. - Do you play rummy? - Oh... - No. No, I don't. - Aw! Look, it's quiz night tonight. Hmm, just when we thought it couldn't get any better. "First prize to be awarded by "Benidorm's number one children's entertainer, Ronnie Herbert." - I haven't brought down the sun block. - Oh, that's okay, I'll get it. (SPLUTTERING COUGH) It's okay, I'm a first-aider. I need that water, please. Thank you. You okay? Am I okay? I was smoking that. What do you think you're playing at? I'm sorry, I thought it was best to put it out. They don't grow on trees, you know. According to Troy, he bumped into the barman near the pool on his way up to the apartment. He asked Troy to help him move some crates or something, and then when he got behind the pool bar, - the barman just jumped on him. - Well, these things happen, don't they? No, they don't. Not until now. Listen, I don't know either of you very well, but I know a decent person when I see one, and you two lads are solid gold, both of you. Which is more than you can say for that shifty sod. Come on, we need you on our team for the quiz tonight. I've always said there's no such thing as a straight man. It just shows you. Absolutely. I've always been comfortable with my sexuality, but very in touch with my feminine side. Oh, yes, in the late '60s, I had an old drinking partner. Martin "Lucky" James, big lad, one of these bodybuilders. We used to go out on the lash, come back to his mum's in Gallowhill and Lucky would bugger me senseless. Great times. Next. From which country is Koffee Annan? Kofi Annan, it's not a beverage. He's the Secretary of... I know who he is. Come on, you know this one. Ghana. What are you doing? I were just about to say Ghana. - Well, that's all right, then. - What do you mean, that's all right? You're supposed to wait for me to tell you the answer. But you said you knew it. Oh, well, that's gonna be great, then, innit? When they're reading out the answers tonight and I say, "Don't worry about the blank ones I left because I actually did know them. "I just couldn't be arsed to fill them in!" Well, I'm gonna have a little sleep if you're gonna be like this. Oh, brilliant. Well, don't worry about me. I said, don't worry about me. Lancashire Pub Quiz Champion being beaten by a load of dickheads because me mum wanted “a little sleep”. I said... Unbelievable! (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) The restaurant will be closing for lunch in 15 minutes, thank you. Dad, can we go to the beach? Mam, can we go to the beach? - No, go and get an ice cream. - Come on. What were it called? - What? - That stuff. - Uh, seafood paella. - That's it. Paella. That's what they eat here, ain't it, the Spanish? I wasn't too keen on all that shite on the top, were you? Eh... I don't usually mind prawns, but not when they're looking at you. That rice tasted a bit funny as well. (MICK SIGHING) Oh, she's there, me mother, talking to that posh woman. She's not that posh. She's had that same wrap-around skirt on for three days in a row. I wonder what she's saying to her. I said, I wonder what she's saying to me mother. She's probably asking to come and sit with us 'cause she's heard how scintillating the conversation is. You wanna talk, you've not said owt all day. I'm on me holidays, I'm relaxing. Hey, have a look. That other queer fella's back now. MICK: Mmm. He doesn't look happy, the fat one. He does not look happy. Mind you, you wouldn't do. Mind you, what does he expect? Look at that George Michael. He doesn't mind where he does it, or who he's doing it with. He's nicer looking than George Michael, that barman. I mean how he is now, not when he was in Wham! Oh, for fuck's sake! I've read the same line on this page six times! - What have you done that for? - Because of you banging on! - Oh, forget it. - Where are you going? Toilet. Don't worry, if George Michael's in there, I'll be straight back out again. Believe me, you're better off without kids. - Well, I'm not sure about that. - I've got seven, all daughters. Not that you'd know, you never see sight nor sound of them. But your daughter brought you on holiday. She didn't bring me anywhere. I brought them on holiday. Oh, I see. Well, I think a daughter would be nice. Well, I'd get cracking if I were you, you're not exactly 21. Well, it's... It's not quite as simple as that. - Oh, aye? What's wrong with you? - Not me. Sorry about that. I eventually found the bottle, it was empty. I had to go to the shop. Not bad really, 8 euros. Well, I'm not surprised he's firing blanks with shorts that tight. He wants to get himself a pair of them baggy ones they're all wearing, get some air between his bits, let them breathe. Well, it's been very nice talking to you. I'd best be off, see what me grandkids are up to. See you later. Where is everybody? Telle and Michael are playing and Mick's gone to the toilet. Oh, I wish I could go. I've not been since Tuesday. What, to the toilet? It's Friday. Don't need to tell me that. I've been counting the hours. Me mother's not been to the toilet since Tuesday. Why, is there no smoking in there? Don't you think you should see the doctor? What, out here? You must be joking. They won't have any English doctors, not out here. I'll wait till I get home, see Dr Kundu. But Dr Kundu's from Pakistan. Oh, yeah, but his wife's from Rotherham. Mam, there's a quiz night on tonight. Oh, right, lovely. No, but look, there's a prize if you win. Can we enter? - What sort of prize? - 100 euro, how much is that? Nearly 70 quid. Oh, my God! Dad, if we win, can we go to the beach? Please, can we? What do you want to go to the beach for? We've got everything here, it's all-inclusive. It's like being in prison. I know, but if we all enter as a team and we win, - can we please go to the beach? - Christ, if us lot win a quiz, I'll take you to Disneyland and make up the money meself. - Oh, my God! We're going to Disneyland! - Hey, hey, calm yourself down, you. All right, if we win, we're off to the beach. Deal Oh, my God! Excellent. Come on, let's go get a drink. What have you said that for? We've got as much chance of winning a quiz as me mother has of being classed anaemic. - Hey! - I know, so when we don't win the quiz, that'll be an end to all the moaning about going to the beach. I thank you. - Good evening, lads and lasses. - Good evening. I said good evening, lads and lasses. ALL: Good evening! Once again, welcome to Neptune's where tonight it's quiz night!

It's me pre-match warm-up. - Well, your pudding's getting cold. - Mother, please! - The liver is very good. - I don't know what I fancy. Really? That's not the impression I got last night. Gavin, please. I was drunk and some dodgy Spanish waiter jumped me. - We should all be laughing about it. - Oh, yes, it's hilarious! At least it proves your theory there's no such... Oh. - Oh, my God! - What? Oh, look, the cabaret's arrived. Me thinks the lady doth protest too much. Right, who's gonna write the answers down? - Me. - I don't know where me glasses are. It's all right, I don't think that's gonna be one of the questions. - Are we going to do this quiz? - I don't mind. Well, you never know, we might win. Look at the type of people here. I can't imagine the average score being very high. Bit like my sperm count.
