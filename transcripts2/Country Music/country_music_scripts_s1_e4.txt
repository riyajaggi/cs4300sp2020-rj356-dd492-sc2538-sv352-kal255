 THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF JIMMIE RODGERS, MORE THAN 30,000 PEOPLE FLOODED INTO HIS HOMETOWN OF MERIDIAN, MISSISSIPPI, TO CELEBRATE THE MAN CONSIDERED BY MANY AS THE FATHER OF COUNTRY MUSIC.

 THAT STARTED IN BRISTOL. NARRATOR: BLUEGRASS INNOVATOR BILL MONROE AND HIS BROTHER CHARLIE PUT ASIDE THEIR LONG-STANDING FEUD FOR THE DAY. RALPH PEER, WHO HAD DONE MORE THAN ANYONE TO RECORD BOTH HILLBILLY AND SO-CALLED "RACE" MUSIC IN ITS EARLY DAYS, WAS THERE, AS WELL. SINGING STAR HANK SNOW, A RODGERS ACOLYTE, UNVEILED A NEW MONUMENT TO THE MAN MERIDIAN HAD ONCE CONSIDERED A WORTHLESS DRIFTER. RODGERS "LED THE WAY FOR ALL OF US," SNOW PROCLAIMED. HE "HANDED IT OVER TO HANK WILLIAMS, WHO BRIDGED THE GAP BETWEEN HILLBILLY AND POPULAR MUSIC." ONLY 5 MONTHS EARLIER, THE INDUSTRY HAD BEEN SHOCKED BY THE PASSING OF HANK WILLIAMS, WHO, LIKE RODGERS, HAD DIED YOUNG. THE MEMORIAL FOR JIMMIE RODGERS MAY HAVE BROUGHT THE FAMILY OF COUNTRY MUSIC TOGETHER, BUT IN 1953, A NEW GENERATION OF AMERICANS WAS HUNGRY FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. ♪ [CHUCK BERRY'S "MAYBELLENE" PLAYING] BERRY: ♪ MAYBELLENE, WHY CAN'T YOU BE TRUE? ♪ ♪ OH, MAYBELLENE ♪ WHY CAN'T YOU BE TRUE? ♪ YOU DONE STARTED DOING THE THINGS YOU USED TO DO ♪ ♪ AS I WAS MOTIVATIN' OVER THE HILL ♪ ♪ I SAW MAYBELLENE IN A COUP DE VILLE... ♪ NARRATOR: IN THE 1950s AND EARLY 1960s, RADIO WAS SEGREGATED, LIKE THE REST OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. RHYTHM AND BLUES PLAYED ON STATIONS PRESUMABLY FOR BLACK AUDIENCES. COUNTRY AND WESTERN WAS HEARD ON STATIONS PRESUMABLY LISTENED TO BY WHITES, BUT IN TRUTH, ON EACH SIDE OF THE RACIAL DIVIDE, YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TUNING IN TO, AND BUYING, BOTH. DARIUS RUCKER: AND A LOT OF TIMES IN THIS COMMUNITY OR THAT COMMUNITY, YOU'RE TOLD, "YOU CAN LISTEN TO THIS. "YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO THAT. "YOU KNOW, WE DON'T LISTEN TO THAT. WE DON'T LISTEN TO THIS," BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? PEOPLE THAT ARE BUYING MUSIC, LISTENING TO MUSIC ARE A LOT MORE OPEN THAN YOU THINK THEY ARE. BERRY: ♪ OH, MAYBELLINE, WHY CAN'T YOU BE TRUE? ♪ ♪ YOU DONE STARTED BACK DOING THE THINGS YOU USED TO DO ♪ NARRATOR: WITH ITS DIVERSE AND TANGLED ROOTS, FROM APPALACHIAN BALLADS AND GOSPEL TO COWBOY SONGS AND THE BLUES, COUNTRY MUSIC HAD ALWAYS BEEN A MIXTURE OF INFLUENCES. NOW IT WOULD HAVE TO ADAPT AGAIN. TWO STRONG-WILLED WOMEN WOULD COME TO NASHVILLE AND BECOME FRIENDS ON THEIR WAY TO BECOMING LEGENDS. ♪ I GO OUT WALKIN'... NARRATOR: ONE WAS A BRASH AND OUTSPOKEN VIRGINIAN WHO WOULD SPECIALIZE IN TENDER SONGS OF ALMOST EXCRUCIATING HEARTACHE. THE OTHER WAS A COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER FROM KENTUCKY WHOSE MUSIC HAD AN UNAPOLOGETIC TWANG. ♪ TWO GIFTED SONGWRITERS WOULD INSPIRE OTHERS TO JOIN THEM AND HELP ESTABLISH NASHVILLE AS A CAPITAL OF SONGWRITING, WHILE TWO PRODUCERS WOULD TRY TO SMOOTH OUT THE MUSIC'S ROUGH EDGES, CREATING A SOUND THAT WOULD BE NAMED FOR THE CITY ITSELF. [ELVIS PRESLEY'S "MYSTERY TRAIN" PLAYING] BUT THE SONIC EXPLOSION THAT WOULD BOTH SPRING FROM COUNTRY MUSIC AND ROCK IT TO ITS CORE WOULD INCLUDE A POOR BOY FROM MISSISSIPPI AND A RESTLESS, DARK-EYED YOUNG MAN FROM RURAL ARKANSAS WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE DEEP VOICE AND A VORACIOUS PASSION FOR EVERY TYPE OF AMERICAN MUSIC. THEIR NEW SOUND WOULD ORIGINATE NOT IN NASHVILLE, BUT FARTHER WEST IN TENNESSEE ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN MEMPHIS, WHERE A PIONEER RECORD PRODUCER BELIEVED THAT THIS MUSIC COULD BE A WAY TO BRING THE RACES TOGETHER. MARTY STUART: ONLY 240 MILES APART BUT UNIVERSES APART WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC. PRESLEY: ♪ TRAIN, TRAIN... STUART: MEMPHIS HAS ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE MORE SOUL, MORE HORN-DRIVEN, MORE BLUES-DRIVEN. IT'S NOT A COUNTRY TOWN. IT'S A RIVER TOWN. PRESLEY: ♪ COMIN' ROUND, ROUND THE BEND... ♪ THERE'S JUST A MAGIC THAT COMES UP FROM THE DELTA AND THAT SURROUNDING COUNTRY. IT'S IN THE GUMBO DOWN THERE.

HE WAS FROM DYESS, ARKANSAS, 22 YEARS OLD, AND JUST OUT OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE. HIS YOUNG BRIDE WAS FROM SAN ANTONIO. JOHNNY CASH HAD CHOSEN MEMPHIS BECAUSE HIS OLDER BROTHER ROY LIVED THERE, WHERE HE HAD A JOB AT A CAR DEALERSHIP. ROSANNE CASH: ROY TOOK MY DAD DOWN TO WHERE HE WORKED. THERE WERE TWO MECHANICS IN THE BAY-- MARSHALL GRANT AND LUTHER PERKINS. MARSHALL TOLD ME THAT HE LOOKED UP FROM THE CAR HE WAS WORKING ON AND HE SAW MY DAD STANDING IN THE DOORWAY, THIS KIND OF SKINNY, BLACK-HAIRED, RESTLESS YOUNG GUY, AND MARSHALL SAID A CHILL STARTED AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND WENT RIGHT DOWN HIS SPINE. IT WAS LIKE HE KNEW-- HE KNEW SOMETHING-- AND DAD CAME OVER TO HIM AND SAID, "ROY SAYS YOU BOYS PLAY A LITTLE GUITAR," AND MARSHALL SAID, "VERY LITTLE," AND HE SAID, "WELL, WE OUGHT TO GET TOGETHER AND PLAY SOMETIME." NARRATOR: BUT CASH'S FIRST PRIORITY WAS FINDING A JOB, AND HE SOON STARTED WORK AS A DOOR-TO-DOOR SALESMAN FOR THE HOME EQUIPMENT COMPANY. ROSANNE CASH: HE WAS THE SINGLE WORST APPLIANCE SALESMAN WHO EVER LIVED. YOU KNOW, AT ONE POINT, HE WENT UP TO A DOOR, KNOCKED ON A DOOR, AND THE HOUSEWIFE ANSWERED, AND HE GOES, "YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY ANYTHING, DO YOU?" HA HA HA! NARRATOR: ON HIS ROUNDS ONE DAY, HE CAME ACROSS AN ELDERLY BLACK MAN PLAYING MUSIC ON HIS FRONT PORCH AND STOPPED TO LISTEN. GUS CANNON: ♪ BEEN A POOR BOY A LONG WAY FROM HOME... ♪ NARRATOR: GUS CANNON HAD ONCE PLAYED IN TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOWS AND HAD BEEN LEADING A JUG BAND ON MEMPHIS' BEALE STREET WHEN RALPH PEER HAD RECORDED HIM BACK IN THE 1920s. CASH STRUCK UP A FRIENDSHIP AND SOMETIMES BROUGHT ALONG HIS OWN GUITAR TO PLAY WITH HIM. ROSANNE CASH: PLAYING GUITAR WITH GUS CANNON, SLAVE SONGS AND BLUES MEET THE DELTA, GOSPEL. SOMEHOW APPALACHIA GETS FILTERED IN THERE. THAT'S IT. THAT'S COUNTRY MUSIC. CANNON: ♪ SHE CRIED, "THE BUCKET GOT... " ♪ NARRATOR: MUSIC HAD ALWAYS PROVIDED BOTH SOLACE AND AN ESCAPE FROM THE HARSH REALITIES OF LIFE FOR JOHNNY CASH. ♪ HE WAS BORN IN 1932, IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION, THE SON OF AN ARKANSAS SHARECROPPER TOO POOR TO PAY THE STATE'S POLL TAX TO VOTE AND A PIOUS MOTHER WHO PLAYED PIANO 3 TIMES A WEEK AT WORSHIP SERVICES IN THE BAPTIST CHURCH. HIS PARENTS SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO AGREE ON A NAME FOR THEIR THIRD SON, SO THEY SETTLED ON THE INITIALS J.R. IN 1935, THEY MOVED FROM SOUTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS TO THE DYESS COLONY, A RESETTLEMENT COMMUNITY CREATED BY PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL. IT OFFERED FAMILIES A FRESH START BY PROVIDING HOMES, 20 ACRES OF LAND, AND SMALL STIPENDS FOR FOOD AND CLOTHING, ALL OF WHICH THE COLONISTS REPAID ONCE THEY HAD CLEARED THE TREES FOR THEIR FIELDS AND BEGAN RAISING CROPS. YOUNG J.R. WAS PICKING COTTON BY THE AGE OF 8. ANNOUNCER: NOW HERE'S THAT WELL-KNOWN AND BETTER-LOVED FAMILY OF RADIO THE CARTER FAMILY-- A.P., SARAH, MAYBELLE, JEANETTE, HELEN, JUNE, AND ANITA, AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ON THE SUNNY SIDE. NARRATOR: THEIR HOME HAD NO ELECTRICITY, AND THEIR ONLY LUXURY WAS A BATTERY-POWERED RADIO. THEIR LIVES WERE REALLY HARD, AND THE RADIO AT THE END OF A DAY, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS LIMITED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO SAVE THE BATTERY, THAT WAS THE LIGHT IN HIS LIFE, HEARING THE CARTER FAMILY ON THE RADIO, ALL OF THAT, THE BLUES, AND GOSPEL. CARTERS: ♪ SOMEBODY'S BOY IS WANDERING ALONE... ♪ ROSEANNE CASH: AS A CHILD, MUSIC WAS SURVIVAL. CARTERS: ♪ AT THEIR OLD HOME IS WAITING HIM THERE ♪ NARRATOR: J.R. HAD ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO HIS BROTHER JACK, WHO SAID HIS LIFE'S AMBITION WAS TO BE A MINISTER, BUT IN 1944, JACK WAS KILLED WHEN HE WAS CUTTING FENCE POSTS AND THE SAW BLADE RIPPED INTO HIS STOMACH. [BOBBY HORTON's "POOR WAYFARIN' STRANGER" PLAYING] "I'M GOING TO THE LIGHT," HE TOLD THE FAMILY AS HE DIED. "CAN YOU HEAR THE ANGELS SINGING? LISTEN, MAMA. CAN YOU HEAR THEM?" ROSANNE CASH: THEY HAD TO WORK THE COTTON FIELDS THE DAY AFTER JACK'S FUNERAL. SHE WOULD GO A LITTLE WAYS AND THEN DROP TO HER KNEES AND SAY, "I CAN'T GO ON"... ♪ AND THEN THEY WOULD SING A SPIRITUAL. ♪ NARRATOR: J.R.'s RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER, WHO COULD BE CRUEL AND DISTANT, WAS ALREADY STRAINED. NOW IT WORSENED. ONCE, AFTER DRINKING HEAVILY, RAY CASH TOLD HIS TEENAGED SON, "TOO BAD IT WASN'T YOU INSTEAD OF JACK." J.R. RETREATED INTO BOOKS ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY AND THE POEMS OF EDGAR ALLEN POE, WENT ON SOLITARY WALKS AT NIGHT AND RETURNED FROM ONE TO TELL HIS MOTHER HE WOULD HONOR JACK'S MEMORY BY BECOMING A GOSPEL SINGER. ♪ AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN 1950, CASH JOINED THE AIR FORCE AND LISTED HIS NAME AS JOHN. HE WAS STATIONED IN GERMANY, WHERE HE MONITORED THE HIGH-SPEED MORSE CODE TRANSMISSION OF SOVIET BOMBERS FOR 3 YEARS. IN OFF HOURS, HE LEARNED TO PLAY SOME BASIC GUITAR CHORDS, FILLED SHEETS OF PAPER WITH SONG LYRICS, DREAMED OF STARTING HIS OWN BAND, AND WROTE DAILY LETTERS TO VIVIAN LIBERTO, A PRETTY AND PETITE ITALIAN-AMERICAN GIRL HE HAD MET DURING HIS TRAINING AT AN AIR FORCE BASE NEAR SAN ANTONIO. ♪ CASH RETURNED TO THE STATES IN THE SUMMER OF 1954. HE AND VIVIAN WERE MARRIED. IT WAS THEN THEY DECIDED TO MAKE THEIR MOVE TO MEMPHIS. SOON, HE AND MARSHALL GRANT AND LUTHER PERKINS WERE GATHERING EACH NIGHT AT GRANT'S HOME TO PLAY MUSIC-- SOME HANK WILLIAMS SONGS, BUT MOSTLY GOSPEL-- WHILE THEIR WIVES PLAYED CARDS IN THE KITCHEN. THEIR SKILLS WERE LIMITED. THE ONLY INSTRUMENT ANY OF THEM PLAYED WAS THE GUITAR, AND NO ONE WAS PARTICULARLY GOOD AT IT... RUFUS THOMAS: ♪ WELL, YOU AIN'T... NARRATOR: BUT MEMPHIS IN 1954 WOULD PROVE THE BEST POSSIBLE PLACE AND THE BEST POSSIBLE TIME FOR THEM TO GET GOOD AT IT. THOMAS: ♪ BEEN SCRATCHIN' AT MY DOOR... ♪ ROSANNE CASH: MEMPHIS IN THE FIFTIES WAS JUST THIS HOT STEW. ALL THE GUYS COMING UP LISTENED TO WDIA, AND B.B. KING WAS A DISC JOCKEY, AND THEY HEARD THIS "RACE" MUSIC AND WERE SO PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED BY IT THAT YOU CAN SAY THAT THAT STATION AND THAT MUSIC CHANGED THE COURSE OF MODERN COUNTRY MUSIC. THOMAS: ♪ YOU AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A BEAR CAT ♪ ♪ BEEN SCRATCHIN' AT MY DOOR... ♪ BOBBY BRADDOCK: THERE WAS A SAYING-- "THE BLUES HAD A BABY, AND THEY CALLED IT ROCK AND ROLL," AND I ALWAYS SAID, "YEAH, AND I THINK THE DADDY WAS THE HILLBILLY," YOU KNOW. PRESLEY: ♪ WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAMA... ♪ NARRATOR: THE MOST POPULAR TUNE ON MEMPHIS RADIO THAT SUMMER WAS A SONG WRITTEN BY ARTHUR "BIG BOY" CRUDUP, A DELTA BLUES MUSICIAN WHOSE ORIGINAL RELEASE HAD ENJOYED ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS ON RHYTHM AND BLUES STATIONS, BUT THIS NEW VERSION WAS SUNG BY A WHITE TEENAGER WITH LONG SIDEBURNS, SLICKED-BACK HAIR, AND AN ALMOST ANGELIC TENOR VOICE. HIS NAME WAS ELVIS ARON PRESLEY. PRESLEY: ♪ THAT'S ALL RIGHT NOW, MAMA ♪ ♪ ANY WAY YOU DO NARRATOR: HE'D BEEN BORN IN TUPELO, MISSISSIPPI, AND, LIKE J.R. CASH, GREW UP LISTENING TO EVERY KIND OF MUSIC ON THE RADIO, FROM HILLBILLY TUNES AND GOSPEL MUSIC HE LOVED AS A BOY TO THE BLUES BY MUDDY WATERS. IN 1954, PRESLEY WAS DRIVING A TRUCK IN MEMPHIS WHEN HE STOPPED AT 706 UNION AVENUE, THE HOME OF TINY SUN RECORDS. ITS OWNER, SAM PHILLIPS, HAD PREVIOUSLY RECORDED RHYTHM AND BLUES ARTISTS, LIKE B.B. KING AND HOWLIN' WOLF. PHILLIPS HAD PAIRED ELVIS WITH TWO MUSICIANS FROM A HILLBILLY BAND CALLED THE STARLITE WRANGLERS BUT INITIALLY WAS UNIMPRESSED WITH THE TUNES THEY WERE PLAYING UNTIL THEY STARTED FOOLING AROUND WITH BIG BOY CRUDUP'S "THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAMA." PRESLEY: ♪ I'M LEAVING TOWN, BABY ♪ I'M LEAVING TOWN FOR SURE ♪ WELL, THEN YOU WON'T BE BOTHERED ♪ ♪ WITH ME HANGIN' ROUND YOUR DOOR ♪ ♪ BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT... NARRATOR: "IT'S NOT BLACK. IT'S NOT WHITE. "IT'S NOT POP. IT'S NOT COUNTRY," PHILLIPS SAID WHEN HE SHARED IT WITH A LOCAL DEEJAY, WHO PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER AS CALLS FLOODED THE STATION FOR MORE. PHILLIPS QUICKLY SCHEDULED ANOTHER SESSION. ONCE AGAIN, PRESLEY STRUGGLED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING DISTINCTIVE. BILL MONROE: ♪ BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY ♪ KEEP ON SHININ' NARRATOR: THEY ALL KNEW BILL MONROE'S LILTING WALTZ "BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY" AND STARTED CLOWNING AROUND WITH IT. PRESLEY: ♪ BLUE MOON, BLUE MOON ♪ ♪ BLUE MOON, KEEP SHININ' BRIGHT ♪ ♪BLUE MOON, KEEP ON SHININ' BRIGHT ♪ ♪ YOU'RE GONNA BRING ME BACK MY BABY TONIGHT ♪ ♪ BLUE MOON, KEEP SHININ' BRIGHT... ♪ NARRATOR:: "HELL," PHILLIPS SAID WHEN THEY FINISHED, "THAT'S DIFFERENT." PRESLEY: ♪ SHINE ON THE ONE ♪ THAT'S GONE AND LEFT ME BLUE... ♪ NARRATOR: THE SINGLE THAT SUN RECORDS RUSHED OUT BECAME A REGIONAL PHENOMENON. RHYTHM AND BLUES STATIONS PLAYED "THAT'S ALL RIGHT," WHILE COUNTRY STATIONS FOCUSED ON "BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY." IT WAS ENOUGH TO EARN PRESLEY AN INVITATION TO PLAY AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY. THE AUDIENCE RESPONDED POLITELY AT BEST, WHILE SOME OPRY REGULARS GRUMBLED THAT HE HAD DESECRATED MONROE'S CLASSIC SONG. CHARLIE DANIELS: THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ELVIS PRESLEY, I HATED HIM BECAUSE I WAS INTO BLUEGRASS MUSIC, AND I WAS BLUEGRASS TO THE BONE BACK THEN, AND HE SANG "BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY," ONE OF MY FAVORITE BILL MONROE SONGS, AND... ♪ A-BUH BUH BUH BUH... I THOUGHT, "WHAT'S HE DOING TO MY SONG?" YOU KNOW? PRESLEY: ♪ STARS SHININ' BRIGHT ♪ WHISPERED ON HIGH ♪ LOVE SAID GOOD-BYE ♪ BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY, KEEP ON SHININ'... ♪ STUART: MONROE DIDN'T LIKE IT MUCH WHEN HE FIRST HEARD IT. HE THOUGHT THEY WERE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING BY WAY OF HIS MUSIC UNTIL THE FIRST ROYALTY CHECK CAME-- HA!--AND THEN, I BELIEVE, MONROE'S TUNE WENT TO, "I TOLD HIM, "IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD I COULD DO TO HELP YOU OUT, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW." HA HA HA! PRESLEY: ♪ I'VE BEEN TRAVELING OVER MILES ♪ ♪ EVEN THROUGH THE VALLEYS, TOO... ♪ NARRATOR: PRESLEY AND HIS MUSIC SEEMED TOO RADICAL FOR THE OPRY, AND THEY DID NOT ASK HIM BACK. PRESLEY: ♪ BABY, TRYIN' TO GET TO YOU ♪ NARRATOR: PHILLIPS THEN SENT HIM TO SHREVEPORT AND THE "LOUISIANA HAYRIDE," WHICH HAD PROVIDED HANK WILLIAMS A PLATFORM WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD. THE "HAYRIDE'S" AUDIENCE LOVED HIM AND CALLED HIM THE HILLBILLY CAT. PRESLEY: ♪ THAT YOU REALLY LOVE ME TRUE ♪ ♪ LORD ABOVE ME KNOWS I LOVE YOU ♪ ♪ IT WAS HE WHO BROUGHT ME THROUGH... ♪ NARRATOR: A NEWSPAPER MARVELED AT WHAT IT CALLED "A WHITE MAN'S VOICE SINGING NEGRO RHYTHMS." BACK IN MEMPHIS, SAM PHILLIPS PUT IT ANOTHER WAY. "I WENT OUT," HE SAID, "AND KNOCKED THE ... OUT OF THE COLOR LINE." ♪ IN LATE 1954, PHILLIPS ARRIVED AT WORK TO FIND JOHNNY CASH SITTING IN THE DOORWAY ASKING FOR AN AUDITION. RALPH EMERY: THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE, AND I GUESS SAM HEARD IT. HE THOUGHT MAYBE HE COULD MAKE LIGHTNING STRIKE TWICE. JOHN WANTED TO BE A GOSPEL SINGER, AND SAM DIDN'T-- HE SAID, "I CAN'T SELL GOSPEL RECORDS. WRITE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOSPEL, AND I'LL CUT IT." NARRATOR: CASH PUT A SIMPLE MELODY TO A POEM HE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT COMING HOME ON THE TRAIN, "HEY PORTER," AND BEGAN PRACTICING WITH LUTHER PERKINS ON A BORROWED ELECTRIC GUITAR AND MARSHALL GRANT, WHO WAS LEARNING TO PLAY BASS. "THERE'S SOMETHING SQUIRRELY ABOUT YOU GUYS," PHILLIPS SAID WHEN HE HEARD THEIR STRIPPED-DOWN STYLE, BUT HE ADMITTED, "IT'S DIFFERENT." JOHNNY CASH: ♪ HEY, PORTER, HEY, PORTER ♪ ♪ WHAT TIME DID YOU SAY? ♪ HOW MUCH LONGER WILL IT BE ♪ TILL I CAN SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY? ♪ ♪ WHEN WE HIT DIXIE, WILL YOU TELL THAT ENGINEER ♪ ♪ TO RING HIS BELL ♪ AND ASK EVERYBODY THAT AIN'T ASLEEP ♪ ♪ TO STAND RIGHT UP AND YELL?

THIS IS LUTHER PERKINS OVER HERE HITTING ALL THOSE HARD NOTES ON THAT GUITAR-- [GUITAR PLAYS] OH, GO, LUTHER-- AND MARSHALL GRANT HITTING THE LOW NOTES ON THIS BASS FIDDLE OVER HERE. ♪ GONNA HAVE TO STRAIN MY EYES, BUT ASK THAT ENGINEER... ♪ ELVIS COSTELLO: HIS VOICE IS SINGULAR. TENNESSEE TWO, THAT'S LIKE A PUNK BAND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S LIKE, IT'S SO-- IT'S JUST, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE BASS IS SO PERCUSSIVE AND LUTHER PERKINS JUST PLAYING, LIKE, THE 4 NOTES THAT SEEM TO, YOU KNOW-- HE SEEMED TO ONLY KNOW 4 NOTES. I LITERALLY THINK THEY SOUND LIKE PUNK ROCK RECORDS. I MEAN THAT AS THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT. I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST SO VIVID. JOHNNY CASH: ♪ HEY, PORTER, HEY, PORTER ♪ ♪ PLEASE OPEN UP THE DOOR... NARRATOR: FOR A WHILE, JOHNNY CASH AND HIS FELLOW SUN RECORDS ARTIST ELVIS PRESLEY WERE SENT OUT ON TOURS TOGETHER, MOSTLY IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST, OPENING FOR BETTER-KNOWN COUNTRY STARS. [HANK SNOW'S "AMONG MY SOUVENIRS" PLAYING] BILL C. MALONE: IN 1955, I WAS A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS. I WENT DOWN TO THE OLD COLISEUM TO SEE HANK SNOW, WHO WAS MY FAVORITE AT THE TIME, AND HANK HAD TO CUT HIS PROGRAM SHORT IN ORDER TO LET ELVIS HAVE A SECOND SHOW.

NARRATOR: THE EVERLY BROTHERS WERE ON A MONTH-LONG TOUR MAKING ONLY $90 A WEEK DOING TENT SHOWS IN MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA WITH BILL MONROE WHEN THE SONG EXPLODED ON THE RADIO. PAUL SIMON: I WENT TO BUY "BYE BYE LOVE" RIGHT AFTER I HEARD IT. THERE WASN'T ANY RECORD STORE IN MY IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD, SO I HAD TO TAKE A BUS AND THEN ANOTHER BUS, TWO BUSSES, TO GET TO A RECORD STORE, BOUGHT IT, CAME HOME, PUT IT ON MY PLAYER, LOVED IT, FLIPPED IT OVER, PLAYED THE OTHER SIDE, LOVED IT, WENT TO PLAY IT AGAIN, SCRATCHED THE RECORD, JUST MORTIFIED. GOT BACK ON THE BUS, TOOK THE SECOND BUS, WENT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER RECORD, COULDN'T, LIKE, EVEN WAIT FOR THE NEXT DAY. I HAD TO HAVE IT AGAIN. I MEAN, IT WAS, LIKE, AN HOUR RIDE AND THEN AN HOUR RIDE BACK, AND THEN I SHOWED IT TO ARTIE, AND, YOU KNOW, WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY WERE SINGING. ♪ BYE-BYE, LOVE... NARRATOR: WITH MORE SONGS WRITTEN BY FELICE AND BOUDLEAUX BRYANT--INCLUDING "WAKE UP LITTLE SUSIE," "ALL I HAVE TO DO IS DREAM," AND "BIRD DOG"-- THE EVERLY BROTHERS WOULD SELL MORE THAN 30 MILLION RECORDS WORLDWIDE IN 3 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] STUBBS: COUNTRY MUSIC WASN'T ALWAYS RECORDED IN NASHVILLE. THE MAJOR LABEL COMPANIES HAD STUDIOS IN NEW YORK, CHICAGO, THE WEST COAST, AND IN SOME CASES, THEY WOULD GO TO DALLAS, TEXAS, AND RECORD, AS WELL, BUT WHEN THE BRADLEYS, OWEN AND HAROLD BRADLEY, OPENED THEIR STUDIO, EVERYTHING CHANGED HERE. MY BROTHER OWEN IS THE BIG DADDY. HE SAW THE BIG PICTURE. HE'S THE ARCHITECT. NARRATOR: OWEN BRADLEY, AN ACCOMPLISHED PIANIST, HAD LED WSM's 26-PIECE BIG BAND ORCHESTRA. HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HAROLD PLAYED GUITAR AND AS A TEENAGER HAD JOINED ERNEST TUBB'S BAND. WHEN DECCA RECORDS ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO RECORD ALL THEIR ARTISTS IN DALLAS, THE BRADLEYS DECIDED TO BUILD A BIGGER, NEWER STUDIO OF THEIR OWN IN NASHVILLE TO TRY TO KEEP DECCA'S BUSINESS. THEY EVENTUALLY FOUND A HOUSE IN A DECAYING RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD ON 16th AVENUE SOUTHWEST OF DOWNTOWN, GUTTED IT, AND, IN 1955, OPENED A STUDIO IN WHAT HAD BEEN ITS BASEMENT. DECCA CHOSE TO STAY, AND SOON, OTHER LABELS BEGAN USING THE BRADLEYS' STUDIO. BUSINESS WAS SO GOOD, THEY ERECTED A MILITARY-SURPLUS QUONSET HUT IN THE BACK YARD AND EQUIPPED IT AS A SECOND STUDIO. [CHET ATKINS' "CANNED HEAT" PLAYING] THEN RCA VICTOR BUILT A NEW STUDIO NEARBY ON 17th AVENUE, WHICH WOULD BE RUN BY PRODUCER CHET ATKINS. BEFORE LONG, ATKINS AND THE BRADLEYS WERE BUSY MAKING RECORDS, AND OTHER HOUSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE BEING CONVERTED INTO OFFICES OF MUSIC PUBLISHERS. EVENTUALLY, THE AREA WOULD BECOME KNOWN AS MUSIC ROW. AMONG THE SONGWRITERS WHO NOW GRAVITATED TO NASHVILLE WAS MEL TILLIS, WHO HAD GROWN UP IN RURAL FLORIDA AND DISCOVERED THAT MUSIC AND A SENSE OF HUMOR HELPED HIM COPE WITH A SPEECH DISORDER. TILLIS: MY DADDY STUTTERED A LITTLE BIT, AND MY BROTHER STUTTERED A LITTLE BIT TOO, AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, THAT'S THE WAY WE TALK," AND I STARTED TO SCHOOL, FIRST GRADE AT WOODROW ELEMENTARY, PLANT CITY, FLORIDA, AND I CAME HOME THE FIRST DAY, AND I SAID, "MAMA, DO I STUTTER?" AND SHE SAID, "YES. YOU DO, SON," AND I SAID, "MAMA, THEY LAUGHED AT ME," AND SHE SAID, "WELL, IF THEY'RE GONNA LAUGH AT YOU, GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO LAUGH ABOUT," AND THAT WAS MY FIRST DAY, I THINK, IN SHOW BUSINESS. HA HA HA! MY TEACHER FOUND OUT THAT I COULD SING WITHOUT STUTTERING, AND SHE'D TAKE ME AROUND TO THE OTHER CLASSES, UP TO THE SIXTH GRADE, AND LET ME SING. NARRATOR: A YEAR AFTER TILLIS CAME TO NASHVILLE, WHERE HE HELPED SUPPORT HIMSELF TOURING WITH MINNIE PEARL, ANOTHER ASPIRING SINGER- SONGWRITER ARRIVED IN TOWN. ROGER MILLER HAD GROWN UP IN ERICK, OKLAHOMA, A TOWN SO SMALL, HE LATER REMEMBERED, "WE DIDN'T HAVE A TOWN DRUNK, SO WE HAD TO TAKE TURNS." AS A BOY, HE WROTE POEMS AND SILLY SONGS, LEARNED TO PLAY THE FIDDLE, AND DREAMED OF LEAVING FARM LIFE FAR BEHIND. IN 1957, HE MOVED TO NASHVILLE, TOOK A JOB AS A BELLHOP AT THE ANDREW JACKSON HOTEL, AND STRUGGLED TO SELL HIS COMPOSITIONS ON MUSIC ROW. HE WAS STANDING IN THERE WITH A-- HAD ON A LITTLE MONKEY OUTFIT. HE WAS A BELLHOP, AND I ASKED HIM, I SAID, "YOU WANT A JOB?" HE SAID, "WITH WHO?" AND I SAID, "MINNIE PEARL." HE SAID, "HOW MUCH DOES IT PAY?" I SAID, "$18 A DAY. IF YOU DO TWO SHOWS, YOU GET 36." I SAID, "WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" HE SAID, "I'M GOING TO GIVE THE ANDREW JACKSON MY TWO-MINUTE NOTICE." NARRATOR: TILLIS AND MILLER BECAME CLOSE FRIENDS AS THEY HUSTLED TO FIND WORK. I TOLD HIM, I SAID, "YOU AIN'T NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT," YOU KNOW, "WRITING THEM OLD, STUPID SONGS YOU'RE WRITING." HE SAID, "YOU AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT WITH THAT DAMN STUTTER, EITHER." HA HA HA! OH...

"IT'S NOTHING BUT A LITTLE, OLD POP SONG," SHE SAID, "I HATE IT," BUT UNDER OWEN BRADLEY'S GUIDANCE, SHE TURNED "WALKIN' AFTER MIDNIGHT" INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL.

BOUDLEAUX HAD ONCE WRITTEN SONG IDEAS ON SCRAPS OF PAPER HE STUFFED IN HIS POCKETS, UNTIL ONE DAY, 14 NEW SONGS WERE LOST WHEN HIS RAINCOAT DISAPPEARED. HIS FRIEND CHET ATKINS BOUGHT HIM A LEATHER-BOUND LEDGER, SIMILAR TO THE KIND STEPHEN FOSTER HAD USED, HE SAID, AND THE BRYANTS BECAME MORE SYSTEMATIC ABOUT THEIR WRITING, FILLING LEDGER AFTER LEDGER WITH SONGS THEY PITCHED TO PRODUCERS AND ARTISTS IN A SETTING THAT ALWAYS WORKED FOR THEM, OVER A STEAMING PLATE OF FELICE'S SPAGHETTI.

BY 12, HE HAD WRITTEN ENOUGH LYRICS TO FILL A MAKESHIFT SONGBOOK HE CONSTRUCTED WITH A CARDBOARD COVER AND STRING HOLDING THE SHEETS OF PAPER TOGETHER. NELSON: I HAD WRITTEN SOME SONGS, AND, YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO HAVE A SONGBOOK, SO I PUT THEM IN A SONGBOOK, AND I HAD THE ARTWORK ON THERE THAT WAS PRETTY FANCY, YOU'LL HAVE TO ADMIT. NARRATOR: AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN 1950, HE BEGAN A RESTLESS EXISTENCE, WORKING AS A RADIO DISC JOCKEY, PERFORMING ON WEEKENDS WITH A SERIES OF COUNTRY BANDS, AND SOMETIMES SELLING ENCYCLOPEDIAS, BIBLES, AND VACUUM CLEANERS DOOR-TO-DOOR. HE WAS ALWAYS SHORT ON MONEY. "I HAWKED MY GUITAR SO MANY TIMES," HE SAID LATER, "THE PAWNBROKER PLAYED IT BETTER THAN I DID." ONCE, STRAPPED FOR CASH, HE SOLD HIS WRITING CREDIT ON TWO SONGS FOR ONLY $200, GIVING UP ALL FUTURE ROYALTIES. ONE OF THEM, "FAMILY BIBLE," BECAME AN IMMEDIATE HIT ON COUNTRY RADIO WHEN SOMEONE ELSE RECORDED IT. THE OTHER, "NIGHT LIFE," WOULD LATER GO ON TO SELL 30 MILLION RECORDS. ENCOURAGED BY THEIR SUCCESS, EVEN IF HE DIDN'T PROFIT FROM THEM, NELSON DECIDED TO TRY NASHVILLE AND LANDED A JOB WITH ONE OF THE PUBLISHING COMPANIES FOR $50 A WEEK. SITTING IN A CONVERTED GARAGE, WHICH SERVED AS HIS WRITING SPACE, NELSON LOOKED AROUND ONE DAY AND ON A PIECE OF CARDBOARD JOTTED DOWN SOME LYRICS TO A SONG HE ENTITLED "HELLO WALLS." THEN HE WENT TO TOOTSIE'S ORCHID LOUNGE TO PLAY IT FOR THE OTHER SONGWRITERS AND SINGERS GATHERED THERE. EMERY: PEOPLE WERE MAKING FUN OF THE SONG. THEY WOULD SAY "HELLO, GLASS." "HELLO, BEER."

GUITAR IN THIS HAND, BRIEFCASE IN THIS HAND. NARRATOR: IN 1958, A GROUP OF INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES, CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECLINING NUMBER OF RADIO STATIONS PLAYING COUNTRY AND WESTERN RECORDS, HAD FORMED THE COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION, THE CMA. JO WALKER-MEADOR, A YOUNG COLLEGE-EDUCATED NASHVILLE WOMAN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE GRAND OLE OPRY, BECAME ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. SHE HELPED PERSUADE BILLBOARD TO REFER TO THE MUSIC AS COUNTRY INSTEAD OF COUNTRY AND WESTERN AND OPENED A HALL OF FAME TO RECOGNIZE IMPORTANT FIGURES IN THE MUSIC'S HISTORY. ALONG WITH THE INFLUENTIAL SONGWRITER AND SONG PUBLISHER, FRED ROSE, THE FIRST TO BE INDUCTED WERE JIMMIE RODGERS AND HANK WILLIAMS. BUT BY NOW, MOST OF THE MUSIC BEING RECORDED IN NASHVILLE NO LONGER SOUNDED ANYTHING LIKE THAT OF RODGERS OR WILLIAMS. JIM REEVES: ♪ OUT WHERE THE BRIGHT LIGHTS ARE GLOWING ♪ ♪ YOU'RE DRAWN...

PEOPLE WERE TOLD THEY COULD REACH HER BY LEAVING A MESSAGE AT WSM, BUT ONCE SHE WAS FREED FROM HER CONTRACT WITH 4 STAR RECORDS, SHE SIGNED ON WITH DECCA. OWEN BRADLEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN LOOKING FOR A SONG THAT COULD HELP HER APPEAL TO BOTH COUNTRY AND POP MARKETS. HE CALLED ON TWO OF NASHVILLE'S HOTTEST SONGWRITERS-- HANK COCHRAN AND HARLAN HOWARD. "THE ESSENCE OF A GOOD COUNTRY SONG," HOWARD ONCE SAID, "WAS 3 CHORDS AND THE TRUTH." THE SONG THEY WROTE WAS SET TO A FAMILIAR COUNTRY BEAT. CLINE HAD AT FIRST OBJECTED TO BRADLEY'S INSISTENCE ON THE ADDITION OF THE JORDANAIRES, WHOSE VOICES, SHE FEARED, MIGHT OVERWHELM HER OWN. PATSY CLINE: ♪ I FALL TO PIECES ♪ ♪ EACH TIME I SEE YOU AGAIN I WAS DRIVING INTO THE CLOSEST LITTLE TOWN, I HEARD THAT RECORD. I WAS GOING THROUGH THAT. I HAD JUST BROKEN UP WITH THIS GUY. I HAD GONE TO A PARTY AND I'M-- AT FIRST, I WASN'T GOING TO GO, AND THEN IT'S LIKE, "NO, I'M GOING AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME." WELL, I HAD A GREAT TIME UNTIL I SAW HIM AND THEN I JUST FELL TO PIECES. WHEN I HEARD THAT RECORD, I LIKE, "WHO KNOWS WHAT I'M JUST LIVING THROUGH? WHO KNOWS THAT?" I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT CAN WRITE A SONG ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU. NARRATOR: WITH "I FALL TO PIECES," PATSY CLINE SCORED HER FIRST NUMBER ONE COUNTRY HIT. CLINE: ♪ YOU WALK BY AND I FALL TO PIECES ♪ RAY WALKER: WE'RE ON A SESSION. SHE'S UPSTAIRS WITH OWEN IN THE CONTROL ROOM. SHE CAME DOWN THOSE STEPS, SASSY, SASSY. SHE PUT HER HAND ON HER HIP, COCKED HER HIP, THREW HER HEAD BACK AND SAID, "BOYS, THEY SAY I GOT A HIT. AIN'T NOBODY TAKING MY FRIGIDAIRE AND MY CAR NOW." NARRATOR: AS MORE AND MORE ARTISTS AND THEIR PRODUCERS TURNED TO THE NASHVILLE SOUND, "COUNTRY MUSIC," "TIME" MAGAZINE NOTED, "IS NOW WEARING CITY CLOTHES." THE STUDIOS ON MUSIC ROW WERE BUSIER THAN EVER. MANY PURISTS COMPLAINED THAT THE DRIVE TO BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM, AND MORE PROFITABLE, MEANT FORSAKING THE RAW, HOMESPUN ROOTS THAT HAD ALWAYS DISTINGUISHED COUNTRY MUSIC, BUT THERE WAS NO DISPUTING HOW WELL IT SOLD. "WHAT IS THE NASHVILLE SOUND?" CHET ATKINS WAS ASKED. HE REACHED INTO HIS POCKET AND JINGLED HIS CHANGE. "THAT," HE SAID, "IS THE NASHVILLE SOUND." JEAN SHEPARD: ♪ THE STEEL GUITAR ♪ PLAYED WHEN I MET HIM... NARRATOR: SOME COUNTRY ARTISTS STILL PREFERRED TO STICK WITH TRADITION. ONE OF THEM WAS A SHARECROPPER'S DAUGHTER FROM OKLAHOMA NAMED JEAN SHEPARD. SHEPARD: COUNTRY MUSIC, IF YOU AIN'T GOT A STEEL GUITAR OR A FIDDLE IN YOUR BAND, YOU AIN'T GOT NO COUNTRY BAND. THAT'S IT. NARRATOR: AFTER SHE JOINED THE GRAND OLE OPRY, SHEPARD FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SINGER HAWKSHAW HAWKINS, A CHARISMATIC WEST VIRGINIAN WHO HAD EARNED 4 MEDALS FIGHTING IN WORLD WAR II. SHEPARD: ♪ STEEL GUITAR... NARRATOR: IN 1960, HE INSISTED ON A PUBLIC WEDDING AT ONE OF THEIR CONCERTS, JUST LIKE HIS HERO HANK WILLIAMS HAD DONE. HAWKINS AND SHEPARD MOVED TO A FARM NEAR NASHVILLE AND SET ABOUT RAISING A FAMILY. HAY: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOAN, AND HOWDY, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND EVERYBODY HERE IN THE OPRY HOUSE.

DADDY, WHEN HE GOT HIS JOB IN THE MINES, IN THE COAL MINES, WE GOT A PHILCO RADIO, AND THAT WAS THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US, WAS THAT RADIO. I'D GO TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT WITH THAT RADIO, WITH A BLANKET OVER THE TOP OF ME. SOMETIMES I'D BE FROZE TO DEATH, BUT I LISTENED TO THE RADIO. ACUFF: ♪ ...TO THE JUNGLES ON THE WABASH CANNONBALL ♪ NARRATOR: LORETTA LYNN WAS BORN ON APRIL 14, 1932 IN A CABIN IN BUTCHER HOLLOW, KENTUCKY. THE OLDEST GIRL IN A FAMILY OF 8 CHILDREN, SHE GREW UP WEARING DRESSES MADE FROM FLOUR SACKS AND TENDING TO HER YOUNGER SIBLINGS, SINGING THEM TO SLEEP IN A ROCKING CHAIR. LYNN: YOU KNOW, WHEN BILL MONROE WOULD START TO SINGING THE BLUEGRASS, MOMMY WOULD HIT THE FLOOR AND START DANCING. AND WHEN MOMMY WOULD HIT THE FLOOR AND START DANCING, YOU'D SEE DADDY WITH HIS HEAD DOWN, AND HE'D LOOK UP AND GO... AND THEN HE'D PUT HIS HEAD BACK DOWN. HE WOULD GRIN, YOU KNOW, AND PUT HIS HEAD BACK DOWN. NARRATOR: AT AGE 15, SHE MET OLIVER "DOOLITTLE" LYNN, A 21-YEAR-OLD WAR VETERAN WHO OUTBID EVERYONE ELSE FOR HER PIE AT A SCHOOLHOUSE SOCIAL. HE WAS THE FIRST BOY SHE EVER KISSED, AND THEY MARRIED WITHIN A MONTH. SHE AND DOOLITTLE MOVED TO WASHINGTON STATE, NEAR THE CANADIAN BORDER, WHERE HE HAD FOUND WORK ON A RANCH, AND SHE HAD 4 CHILDREN IN QUICK SUCCESSION WHILE THE COUPLE SCRAPED TO GET BY. HEARING HIS YOUNG WIFE SING AROUND THE HOUSE, DOOLITTLE BOUGHT LORETTA A $17 GUITAR FROM SEARS. SHE TAUGHT HERSELF TO PLAY IT, COMPOSING SONGS OF HER OWN AND PLAYING THEM TO HER CHILDREN. LYNN: AND I'D LINE THEM UP. I'D LINE THESE KIDS UP AND I'D SING AND SING, AND I'D SAY, "NOW, WHICH ONE OF THESE SONGS DO YOU LIKE? DO YOU THINK MOMMY CAN SING?" AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WOULD SAY, "YEAH, MOMMY, YOU CAN SING." NARRATOR: SOON SHE WAS PERFORMING WITH A SMALL COUNTRY BAND FOR $5.00 A NIGHT AT A LOCAL TAVERN AND WON A TALENT CONTEST ON A TACOMA TV SHOW. A WEALTHY LUMBERMAN OFFERED TO FINANCE A RECORDING OF A SONG SHE HAD WRITTEN, "I'M A HONKY TONK GIRL." LYNN: ♪ MANY NIGHT I'VE LAID AWAKE AND CRIED ♪ ♪ WE ONCE WERE HAPPY ♪ MY HEART WAS IN A WHIRL ♪ BUT NOW I'M A HONKY TONK GIRL ♪ ♪ SO TURN THAT... HAGGARD: I LIKE THE VERY FIRST RECORD SHE DID. ♪ I'M JUST A HONKY TONK GIRL ♪ I THINK THAT'S THE BEST SHE EVER SOUNDED. I LOVE THAT RECORD. SHE HAD AUTHENTICITY IN IT. SHE WAS HUNGRY. LYNN: ♪ NOW I'M A HONKY TONK GIRL... ♪ HAGGARD: SHE WANTED OUT OF THAT LIFE SHE WAS IN AND KIND OF SUNG HER WAY OUT OF PRISON. NARRATOR: TO PROMOTE HER RECORD, SHE AND DOOLITTLE STARTED SENDING COPIES OF IT, ALONG WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF LORETTA DRESSED IN A COWGIRL OUTFIT, TO DISC JOCKEYS AND STATION MANAGERS AROUND THE NATION. IN EARLY 1960, THEY SET OFF TO DO IT IN PERSON, GOING FROM STATION TO STATION, SLEEPING IN THEIR CAR, LIVING ON BALONEY AND CHEESE SANDWICHES. LYNN: I HAD ONE LITTLE DRESS. DOO GOT IT FOR ME FOR MY SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY. SO I HAD KEPT IT ALL THIS TIME, YOU KNOW, AND I KEPT THAT ONE DRESS SO I COULD GO SOMEPLACE, AND I'D GET IN THE BACKSEAT AND CHANGE INTO MY LITTLE BLACK AND WHITE DRESS AND PULL MY JEANS OFF AND GO IN THE RADIO STATION, AND THEN WHEN I'D COME BACK, I'D PULL MY DRESS OFF, HANG IT BACK UP, AND WE'D GO ON DOWN THE ROAD TO THE NEXT RADIO STATION. THAT'S HOW WE DID IT. NARRATOR: "I'M A HONKY TONK GIRL" HIT NUMBER 14 ON THE COUNTRY CHARTS. THEY DECIDED TO HEAD FOR NASHVILLE. THERE, SHE PESTERED OFFICIALS AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY UNTIL THEY GRANTED HER A SPOT ON THE SHOW. LYNN: ♪ AND NOW I'M A HONKY TONK GIRL ♪ NARRATOR: MEANWHILE, ONE OF LORETTA'S IDOLS, PATSY CLINE, WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT THAT KILLED TWO PEOPLE. PATSY WAS CATAPULTED THROUGH HER CAR'S WINDSHIELD AND HOSPITALIZED IN CRITICAL CONDITION WITH BROKEN BONES, A DISLOCATED HIP, AND A DEEP GASH THAT SLICED ACROSS HER FOREHEAD. LORETTA WAS SCHEDULED TO BE ON ERNEST TUBB'S MIDNITE JAMBOREE. LYNN: AND I SUNG ON THE ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP, "I FALL TO PIECES" AND DEDICATED IT TO HER IN THE HOSPITAL. SO SHE SENT HER HUSBAND OUT, DOWN TO TOWN TO GET ME, TO BRING ME TO THE HOSPITAL, AND THAT'S WHERE I MET HER, WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. NARRATOR: LORETTA AND PATSY SOON BECAME CLOSE FRIENDS. SHE STARTED GIVING LYNN ADVICE ON HER CAREER, MONEY FOR RENT, AND NICER CLOTHES. CLINE SLOWLY RECOVERED, APPEARING ONCE AT THE OPRY IN A WHEELCHAIR TO SHOW HER FANS SHE WAS MENDING. [APPLAUSE] CLINE: I'M KIND OF OUT OF WIND. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE WORKED SINCE I GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. [MAN LAUGHS] WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT? YOU WASN'T THERE. [LAUGHTER] OH, ME. WE'D LIKE TO SLOW THINGS DOWN SO I CAN GET MY BREATH. ♪ I MUST MAKE UP MY MIND TODAY ♪ ♪ WHAT TO HAVE, WHAT TO HOLD... ♪ NARRATOR: AS SOON AS PATSY CLINE FELT UP TO IT, OWEN BRADLEY BROUGHT HER BACK TO HIS STUDIO TO RECORD A NEW ALBUM FEATURING MORE OF THE NASHVILLE SOUND. THE SONG THAT PRODUCED THE ALBUM'S BIGGEST HIT WAS A SLOW, SOFT LAMENT WILLIE NELSON HAD WRITTEN. HE HAD ORIGINALLY ENTITLED THE SONG, "STUPID," BUT THEN CHANGED HIS MIND. HE CALLED IT "CRAZY." NELSON: I WAS AT TOOTSIE'S ORCHID LOUNGE IN NASHVILLE, AND CHARLIE DICK, PATSY'S HUSBAND WAS THERE. HE AND I WERE HAVING A BEER. I HAD A DEMO ON "CRAZY." AND I GOT IT ON TOOTSIE'S JUKEBOX AND PLAYED IT, AND HE HEARD IT AND SAID, "THAT WOULD BE A GREAT SONG FOR PATSY. LET'S GO PLAY IT FOR HER." WE WENT OVER TO HER HOUSE. IT WAS ABOUT 12:30, 1:00 WHEN WE GOT THERE, AND I WOULDN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR, SO HE WENT IN AND PATSY COME OUT AND MADE ME GET OUT OF THE CAR AND COME IN AND LISTENED TO THE SONG. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD SONG. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WRITE ONE, YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR WHETHER IT'S NOT GREAT, BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD SONG, AND I PLAYED IT FOR PATSY CLINE AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT SONG. NARRATOR: "I'M GLAD YOU WOKE ME UP," PATSY SAID. "I'M RECORDING IT." BUT IN THE STUDIO, AS THE MUSICIANS WORKED ON THEIR PARTS, PATSY WAS HAVING TROUBLE. SHE COULDN'T GET WILLIE NELSON'S UNIQUE PHRASING ON HIS DEMO VERSION OUT OF HER HEAD. AND WILLIE HAD RECORDED IT ♪ CRAZY, DU-DU BA-BING DA DONG ♪ CRAZY FOR FEELING SO LONELY ♪ WELL, SHE GOT THAT TEMPO LOCKED INTO HER MIND, AND IT WAS KIND OF WESTERN, YOU KNOW? SO SHE CAME TO THE STUDIO AND OWEN SLOWED IT DOWN TO CRAZY, WHOO-HOO-HOO ♪ THAT'S US. ♪ CRAZY FOR FEELING SO LONE ♪ WELL, SHE COULDN'T GET IT. SHE HAD "DOMP-DEE, DOMP-DEE, DOMP" IN HER MIND. NARRATOR: OWEN BRADLEY SENT CLINE HOME WHILE HE AND THE MUSICIANS FINISHED THE BACKGROUND TRACK. TWO WEEKS LATER, SHE RETURNED TO LAY DOWN HER VOCALS OVER IT, AND IN HER FIRST TAKE DELIVERED THE KIND OF PERFORMANCE THEY HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR. CLINE: ♪ CRAZY JORDANAIRES: ♪ OOH, OOH, OOH ♪ I'M CRAZY FOR FEELING SO LONELY ♪ ♪ OOH, OOH, ♪ I'M CRAZY ♪ CRAZY FOR FEELING SO BLUE... ♪ NARRATOR: RELEASED AS A SINGLE, "CRAZY" QUICKLY CROSSED OVER TO THE TOP 10 ON THE POP CHARTS, JUST AS OWEN BRADLEY HAD WANTED. TRISHA YEARWOOD: WHEN YOU HEAR HER SING, IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SHE IS IN THE ROOM, RIGHT HERE, AND YOU FEEL THE EMOTION IN EVERY LYRIC. IF YOU CAN FIND THAT PERFECT SONG AND THEN YOU MARRY IT WITH THAT-- WITH THE VOICE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO WITH, IT'S TIMELESS. CLINE: ♪ ...YOU ♪ CRAZY ♪ FOR THINKING THAT MY LOVE WOULD HOLD YOU ♪ ♪ I'M CRAZY FOR TRYING ♪ AND CRAZY FOR CRYING ♪ AND I'M CRAZY FOR LOVING ♪ ♪ YOU JORDANAIRES: ♪ OOH RAY CHARLES: ♪ HEY, GOOD LOOKIN' ♪ WHATCHA GOT COOKING? NARRATOR: BY 1962, RAY CHARLES HAD BEEN A RHYTHM AND BLUES STAR FOR A DECADE, AND WHEN HE WAS GIVEN CREATIVE CONTROL OF AN ALBUM FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE STUNNED THE MUSIC WORLD BY CHOOSING TO RECORD COUNTRY SONGS. CHARLES: ♪ I GOT A BRAND-NEW CAR... ♪ RONNIE MILSAP: PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSE TO RAY CHARLES, I THINK THEY WERE KIND OF DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THAT RAY HAD CHOSE THAT, BUT RAY CHARLES LISTENS TO THE RADIO JUST LIKE I DO. HE LISTENED TO IT EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT. HE KNEW WHAT WAS REALLY THE PULSE OF WHAT AMERICA'S ALL ABOUT... CHARLES: ♪ THE SPOT RIGHT OVER THE HILL ♪ ♪ THERE'S SODA POP AND A DANCE... ♪ MILSAP: THESE SONGS THAT TELL STORIES, SO THAT'S WHAT COUNTRY MUSIC REALLY IS. CHARLES: ♪ WHATCHA GOT COOKING? ♪ HE'S LISTENING TO THE RADIO, IS HE NOT GOING TO HEAR COUNTRY MUSIC? HE'S A SINGER. HE'S NOT GOING TO HEAR CHURCH MUSIC, HYMNS. AND WE TEND TO THINK OF IT ONE WAY, LIKE THESE WHITE MUSICIANS HEARD THESE BLACK MUSICIANS PLAY. THE BLACK MUSICIANS WERE LISTENING TO THE WHITE MUSICIANS, TOO. NARRATOR: "YOU TAKE COUNTRY MUSIC, YOU TAKE BLACK MUSIC," RAY CHARLES SAID, AND "YOU GOT THE SAME GODDAMN THING EXACTLY." ON HIS ALBUM "MODERN SOUNDS IN COUNTRY AND WESTERN MUSIC," HE CHOSE SONGS LIKE HANK WILLIAMS' "HEY GOOD LOOKIN'," THE EVERLY BROTHERS' "BYE BYE LOVE." AND A TUNE BY COUNTRY SINGER DON GIBSON, "I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU." CHORUS: ♪ I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU ♪ [APPLAUSE] ♪ I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ♪ TO LIVE IN MEMORIES ♪ OF THE LONESOME TIMES... VINCE GILL: AND YOU ASK HIM WHY HE LIKED COUNTRY MUSIC, HE SAID, "I LIKE THE STORIES. I LIKE THE STORIES THEY TELL." THAT WAS A HUGE RECORD FOR US, MAYBE EVEN MORE SO THAN RAY, FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HANG OUR HAT ON HOW SOULFUL THIS MUSIC COULD BE. CHARLES: ♪ TO LIVE IN MEMORIES ♪ OF A LONESOME TIME ♪ YEAH, BABY, YEAH... MILSAP: "I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU" HIT THE RADIO AND THAT WHOLE SUMMER OF 1962, IT JUST PLAYED ALL SUMMER LONG. TO SELL ONE SONG, ONE SIDE OF A 45 RECORD, CHARTS ALL THE WAY TO NUMBER ONE AND SELLS 20 MILLION RECORDS, THAT'S PRETTY BIG. NARRATOR: AS A SINGLE, "I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU" TOPPED THE CHARTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN, WON A GRAMMY FOR BEST R&B; RELEASE, AND SOLD SO BRISKLY, ONE ATLANTA RECORD STOREOWNER REPORTED, "PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN OWN RECORD PLAYERS ARE BUYING IT." "RAY CHARLES," WILLIE NELSON SAID, "DID MORE FOR COUNTRY MUSIC THAN ANY ONE ARTIST HAS EVER DONE." CHARLES: ♪ SO I'LL JUST LIVE MY LIFE ♪ ♪ I THINK I MIGHT LIVE MY LIFE ♪ DREAMS OF YESTERDAY I MEAN, MUSIC IS ALWAYS STRIVING TO THE BEST THING, AND THE BEST THING IS THE MIX, YOU KNOW? IT ALWAYS IS. YOU HAVE THESE TWO THINGS, WHICH ARE PRETTY COOL ON THEIR OWN. THEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER AND ALL THE STRENGTHS MULTIPLY, YOU KNOW, AND BECOME THIS BEAUTIFUL THING. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AMERICAN MUSIC HAS TAKEN OVER THE WORLD, BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN FEEL THAT IT COMES FROM ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS A HUNDRED. NARRATOR: BY THE EARLY 1960s, JOHNNY CASH WAS ON THE ROAD MORE THAN EVER, AWAY FROM HIS WIFE AND 4 DAUGHTERS. JOHNNY CASH: ♪ HEAR THAT LONESOME WHIPPOORWILL... ♪ NARRATOR: THE TENSIONS BETWEEN HIM AND VIVIAN WERE PALPABLE. "I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE UP THE LIFE THAT WENT WITH MY MUSIC," CASH SAID LATER, "AND VIVIAN WASN'T GOING TO ACCEPT THAT, "SO THERE WE WERE, VERY UNHAPPY. THERE WAS ALWAYS A BATTLE AT HOME." CASH: ♪ ...I COULD CRY ROSANNE CASH: BEING THE DAUGHTER OF A REALLY FAMOUS GUY WAS FRAUGHT WITH SO MUCH ANXIETY, PARTLY BECAUSE OF MY MOTHER. AND SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF FAME, AND SHE WAS AFRAID WE'D BE KIDNAPPED, AND SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING IN THE PAPERS, AND SHE WANTED A QUIET LIFE, A CONTAINED LIFE, AND MY DAD DID NOT HAVE A QUIET AND CONTAINED LIFE. CASH: ♪ THE MOON JUST WENT BEHIND THE CLOUDS ♪ ♪ TO HIDE ITS FACE AND CRY ♪ DID YOU EVER... NARRATOR: AFTER ONE ROAD TRIP, CASH BROUGHT HIS WHOLE BAND TO THE HOUSE, ALONG WITH PATSY CLINE, WHO WAS NOW PART OF HIS TOUR. VIVIAN BECAME FRIENDS WITH PATSY, BUT NOT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN ALSO APPEARING REGULARLY WITH JOHNNY-- JUNE CARTER. CARLENE CARTER: A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE IN THE DARK ABOUT IT, BUT IT WAS PRETTY EVIDENT TO EVEN ME, A YOUNG--A SMALL CHILD, THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE BETWEEN THEM, A SPECIAL BOND. NARRATOR: CASH SOON ADDED JUNE'S MOTHER MAYBELLE AND HER SISTERS INTO THE ACT, AND WHEN THEY APPEARED WITH HIM AT A BIG SHOW AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL, VIVIAN TOOK THE GIRLS TO THE CONCERT. AFTER IT WAS OVER, THEY WATCHED AS JOHNNY JUMPED INTO A WAITING CADILLAC TO DRIVE OFF WITH JUNE. JOHNNY CASH: ♪ AS I WONDER WHERE YOU... ♪ NARRATOR: "THE LOOK ON VIVIAN'S FACE," ONE BAND MEMBER REMEMBERED, "WAS PURE ANGUISH." JOHNNY CASH: ♪ ...COULD CRY NARRATOR: BY THE END OF 1962, JOHNNY CASH AND JUNE CARTER'S AFFAIR HAD DEEPENED, BUT THEY WERE CONFLICTED ABOUT IT. THEY WERE BOTH STILL MARRIED TO OTHER PEOPLE-- JUNE TO HER SECOND HUSBAND-- AND BOTH HAD CHILDREN TO CONSIDER. ANITA CARTER: ♪ LOVE IS A BURNING THING... NARRATOR: JUNE POURED HER FEELINGS INTO A NEW SONG, CO-WRITTEN WITH MERLE KILGORE, THAT HER SISTER ANITA RECORDED. CARLENE CARTER: WHEN SHE WROTE "RING OF FIRE" IT WAS ABOUT SOMETHING REAL. IT WAS ABOUT TRUE PASSION AND TRUE LOVE AND THE SCARY FACTOR OF THAT. YOU KNOW, "I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE," THAT IS SCARY. NARRATOR: ANITA CARTER'S "RING OF FIRE" WAS NOT A HIT, BUT IN MARCH OF 1963, JOHNNY CASH DECIDED TO RECORD IT HIMSELF. HE WANTED A FRESH SOUND, MAYBE EVEN MEXICAN HORNS, AND HE TURNED TO COWBOY JACK CLEMENT, A FRIEND FROM HIS SUN RECORD DAYS, NOW LIVING IN TEXAS. COWBOY JACK CLEMENT: AND THE PHONE RANG AND JOHNNY CASH WANTED ME TO-- HE SAID HE'S GOING TO CUT A RECORD IN NASHVILLE WITH TRUMPETS ON IT, AND HE WANTED ME TO COME UP AND HELP HIM FIGURE IT OUT, SO I FLEW UP AND GOT IN THERE AND HE HAD THESE TWO OR 3 TRUMPETS, AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO. THEY HAD MUSIC, BUT IT WAS BLANK, SO I SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU GO [IMITATES TRUMPET]?" AND THEY WROTE THAT DOWN, AND THEN I SAID, "GO [IMITATES TRUMPET]" ["RING OF FIRE" PLAYING] JOHNNY CASH: ♪ LOVE IS A BURNING THING ♪ ♪ AND IT MAKES A FIERY RING ♪ BOUND BY WILD DESIRE ♪ I FELL INTO A RING OF FIRE ♪ I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE... ♪ NARRATOR: "RING OF FIRE" SPENT 7 WEEKS AT NUMBER ONE ON THE COUNTRY CHARTS, AND AN ALBUM FEATURING IT LASTED MORE THAN A YEAR ON THE POP CHARTS. JOHNNY CASH: ♪ THE RING OF FIRE... NARRATOR: VIVIAN HATED "RING OF FIRE" AND TRIED HER BEST TO AVOID THE RADIO STATIONS THAT SEEMED TO PLAY IT CONSTANTLY. SHE ASSOCIATED IT WITH JUNE CARTER, WHOSE VOICE COULD BE HEARD ON THE RECORD SINGING BACKUP WITH HER SISTERS. "THE MERE MENTION OF HER NAME ANNOYED ME," VIVIAN WOULD REMEMBER. "I LONGED FOR THE DAYS WHEN JOHNNY TOLD ME HE'D ALWAYS WALK THE LINE FOR ME." JOHNNY CASH: ♪ THE RING OF FIRE ♪ THE RING OF FIRE, THE RING OF FIRE ♪ ANDERSON: COUNTRY MUSIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAMILY. AND WHEN TRAGEDY STRUCK AND SOME PEOPLE IN BELLE MEADE OR THE FANCY PLACES IN NASHVILLE COULD HAVE REALLY CARED LESS, I THINK IT JUST BROUGHT US TOGETHER THAT MUCH MORE BECAUSE IT HURT US ALL. IT WAS LIKE ONE PERSON, YOU KNOW, GOT CUT AND WE ALL BLED. NARRATOR: IN FEBRUARY 1963, HAWKSHAW HAWKINS WAS EXCITED ABOUT A NEW SINGLE THAT HE HAD JUST RECORDED, A SWINGING HEARTBREAK SONG, "LONESOME 7-7203." HAWKINS: ♪ LONESOME 7-7203... NARRATOR: HE WAS EVEN MORE EXCITED THAT HIS WIFE JEAN SHEPARD WAS 8 MONTHS PREGNANT WITH THEIR SECOND CHILD. HAWKINS WAS JUST STARTING TO PROMOTE HIS NEW RECORD WHEN WORD REACHED NASHVILLE THAT A POPULAR DISC JOCKEY IN KANSAS CITY HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. A LOCAL PROMOTER THERE WAS PUTTING TOGETHER A BENEFIT CONCERT TO HELP THE FAMILY, AND A TROUPE OF OPRY STARS AGREED TO GO TO KANSAS CITY FOR THE SHOW, INCLUDING HAWKINS. AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE PEOPLE WENT, AND HAWK WAS ONE OF THEM. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO VOLUNTEER 'CAUSE BACK THEN, YOU DID STUFF LIKE THIS. NARRATOR: BEFORE HE LEFT FOR KANSAS CITY, HAWKSHAW TOLD JEAN, "I HOPE THIS ONE'S A BOY, TOO." THEN HE STOPPED BY THE WSM STUDIO TO HAND-DELIVER A COPY OF HIS NEW SINGLE. ANDERSON: HAWKSHAW GAVE RALPH EMERY A COPY OF "LONESOME 7-7203," A PROMOTIONAL 45-RPM COPY WITH A WHITE LABEL ON IT. AND ON THE LABEL, HE WROTE TO RALPH, "PLAY THE HELL OUT OF IT, HAWK."

CLINE: ♪ I REMEMBER OUR ♪ FADED LOVE...

HE SAID HE'D FLY BACK LATER WITH PATSY CLINE. BECAUSE OF HER RECENT SUCCESS, CLINE NOW TRAVELED IN A 4-SEAT PIPER COMANCHE FLOWN BY HER MANAGER RANDY HUGHES.

WEST OF NASHVILLE, THEY FLEW INTO DENSE RAIN CLOUDS. HUGHES WAS NOT TRAINED TO FLY BY INSTRUMENTS. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] SHEPARD: IT WAS ABOUT 10:00, 10:30. I HAD PUT THE BABY DOWN IN BED AND I HAD LAID DOWN AND HAD JUST DOZED OFF TO SLEEP WHEN THE PHONE RANG, AND IT WAS THIS WOMAN, EILEEN, AND SHE SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" I SAID, "WELL, I'M TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP." AND SHE SAID, "OH, MY GOD, YOU DON'T KNOW." I KNEW THEN. NARRATOR: FRIENDS STARTED SHOWING UP AT THE HOUSE, INCLUDING MINNIE PEARL, WHO TRIED TO HELP JEAN THROUGH THE LONG NIGHT AS THEY WAITED FOR MORE NEWS. ANDERSON: I GOT A PHONE CALL ABOUT 7:15 THAT MORNING FROM THE WIFE OF A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. SHE SAID, "GO TURN ON WSM RIGHT NOW." SO I TURNED ON THE RADIO AND OPRY ANNOUNCERS WERE TALKING AND THEY WERE-- THEY WERE CRYING. YOU COULD ACTUALLY HEAR THE TEARS IN THEIR VOICE AS THEY WERE TELLING THEIR AUDIENCE AND THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS PLANE HAD GONE DOWN. NARRATOR: MEANWHILE, A FRANTIC SEARCH WAS UNDERWAY NEAR CAMDEN, TENNESSEE. THE SONGWRITER ROGER MILLER JOINED THE TEAM COMBING THE FOREST, CALLING OUT HIS FRIENDS' NAMES IN THE DARKNESS.
