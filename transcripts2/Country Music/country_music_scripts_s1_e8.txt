 ["MULE SKINNER BLUES" BY DOLLY PARTON PLAYS] PARTON: ♪ WELL, GOOD MORNING ♪ CAPTAIN ♪ GOOD MORNING TO YOU, SIR ♪ HEY, HEY ♪ YEAH... MAN: IF YOU LOOK AT IT OVER THE LAST 90 YEARS NOW, THAT IT'S BEEN BEING RECORDED, IT WOULDN'T BE ONE THING. IT WOULDN'T BE ANY-- ANYWHERE CLOSE TO ONE THING.

 AND THAT'S, TO ME, THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY IT DIFFERENTLY. YOUR HEART'S GOING TO MAKE IT COME OUT OF YOU IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN IT IS ME. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

 ♪ YODEL-A-HEE... I DON'T THINK I WOULD ENJOY COUNTRY MUSIC IF IT STAYED THE SAME. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO. PARTON: ♪ ...A-HEE ♪ HEE-HEE   ♪ HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE ♪ MULE SKINNER BLUES [WHISTLES] HYAH! HYAH... ["ON THE ROAD AGAIN" BY WILLIE NELSON PLAYS] NELSON: ♪ ON THE ROAD AGAIN, JUST CAN'T WAIT... ♪ NARRATOR: IN THE EARLY 1980s, THE MAINSTREAM APPEAL OF THE SMOOTH COUNTRYPOLITAN SOUND, ALONG WITH A SPATE OF POPULAR HOLLYWOOD MOVIES, HAD HELPED IGNITE A BOOM IN COUNTRY MUSIC. BUT BY 1984, ACTUAL SALES OF COUNTRY MUSIC RECORDS HAD DECREASED BY MORE THAN 27%. "THOSE GOOD TIMES ARE GONE," THE "NEW YORK TIMES" DECLARED, "AND THEY WON'T BE COMING BACK." NO SOONER HAD THE DIP IN COMMERCIAL SUCCESS BEEN NOTICED AND MOURNED THAN IT BEGAN REVERSING ITSELF. TWO NEW CABLE NETWORKS DEDICATED EXCLUSIVELY TO COUNTRY MUSIC BROUGHT INTERVIEWS AND STORIES ABOUT A NEW GENERATION OF STARS TO FANS ACROSS THE NATION, USING MUSIC VIDEOS TO PROMOTE THEIR NEW SONGS. IN THE LAST HALF OF THE 1980s, SALES WOULD DOUBLE AND NEVER LOOK BACK. BUT WITHIN THE BROAD EMBRACE OF ITS EXTENDED FAMILY, THE AGE-OLD QUESTION OF WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T COUNTRY MUSIC WOULD ONLY INTENSIFY. COULD A MUSIC OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE, DESCRIBED AS 3 CHORDS AND THE TRUTH, SURVIVE THE CHANGES OF THE LATE 20th CENTURY WITH ITS SOUL AND ITS SIMPLICITY INTACT? WOULD ITS STARS AND THE MUSIC ITSELF LOSE THEIR WAY, OR WOULD THEY HEED THE OLD SAYING "DON'T GET ABOVE YOUR RAISIN'"? MAN: "DON'T GET ABOVE YOUR RAISIN'" IS A TERM I ASSOCIATE WITH THE SOUTH. IT'S THE KIND OF ADVICE THAT PARENTS WOULD GIVE THEIR CHILDREN. "BUT AS YOU GO INTO THE WORLD, "DON'T FORGET WHERE YOU CAME FROM. "DON'T GET SO UPPITY THAT YOU FORGET US AND YOU FORGET THE VALUES THAT YOU WERE TAUGHT BACK HOME." AND I THINK FOR COUNTRY MUSIC, IT'S JUST A REMINDER TO THE MUSIC IN GENERAL, "DON'T FORGET WHERE YOU CAME FROM." NARRATOR: TWO TALENTED BLUEGRASS PICKERS WOULD HELP LEAD COUNTRY'S REVIVAL. ONE WOULD ADD DRUMS AND ELECTRIC GUITARS TO THE TRADITIONAL STRING BAND AND SOMEHOW MAKE THE FATHER OF BLUEGRASS HAPPY WITH THE RESULT. THE OTHER, A GIFTED GUITARIST WITH HIS OWN HIGH LONESOME VOICE, WOULD BRING A SWEET AUTHENTICITY TO THE MUSIC THAT ENDEARED HIM TO OLD AND NEW FANS ALIKE. A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER FROM THE BACKWOODS OF KENTUCKY WOULD STRUGGLE TO TRANSCEND THEIR COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP, MESMERIZING AUDIENCES WITH THEIR ASTONISHING HARMONIES. A SPIRITED COWGIRL FROM OKLAHOMA, WITH A POWERFUL, UNMISTAKABLE VOICE WOULD COME TO SPEAK FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE WHILE IN CALIFORNIA, A YOUNG SINGER-SONGWRITER WOULD PROUDLY DECLARE HIMSELF A HILLBILLY AS HE WALKED THE STREETS OF BAKERSFIELD. AND IN NASHVILLE, ANOTHER SINGER-SONGWRITER WOULD EMERGE FROM AN INTIMATE CAFEÉ THAT SPECIALIZED IN GIVING UNKNOWNS A FAIR HEARING TO BECOME COUNTRY MUSIC'S BEST-SELLING ARTIST. HEY! PARTON: WE ARE ALL RELATED WHEN IT COMES TO COUNTRY MUSIC AND TO COUNTRY SONGS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE LIKE BLOOD KIN. YOU KNOW, ANYBODY THAT LOVES COUNTRY MUSIC, THEY'RE RELATED TO YOU. YOU'VE GOT THAT IN COMMON. RICKY SKAGGS: ♪ YOU'RE A COUNTRY BABY ♪ ♪ THAT'S PLAIN TO SEE ♪ DON'T GET ABOVE YOUR RAISIN' ♪ STAY DOWN TO EARTH WITH ME ["I STILL MISS SOMEONE" BY JOHNNY CASH PLAYS] JOHNNY CASH: GET TO HAVE A SMOKE WITH A.P. I NEVER GOT TO HAVE A SMOKE WITH A.P. BEFORE. HE DIED IN 1960, AND I NEVER GOT TO KNOW HIM. NOT REALLY. I NEVER GOT TO HAVE A SMOKE WITH HIM. CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH? YES, MA'AM. IT IS BEAUTIFUL... NARRATOR: BY THE MID-1980s, JOHNNY CASH WAS ABOUT TO START HIS FOURTH DECADE IN COUNTRY MUSIC. TO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, HE WAS COUNTRY MUSIC, BUT HIS SOLO RECORDS WERE NO LONGER SELLING. ONLY TWO SINGLES HAD REACHED THE TOP 10 IN MORE THAN A DECADE. JOHNNY CASH: ♪ SOMEWHERE, AND I STILL... ♪ NARRATOR: MANY OF HIS RECENT ALBUMS FAILED TO CHART AT ALL. IN 1986, COLUMBIA RECORDS ABRUPTLY DROPPED CASH FROM ITS ROSTER. HE HAD BEEN WITH THE LABEL SINCE 1958. NO ONE, INCLUDING CASH, SAW IT COMING. MAN: IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY HAD DROPPED AN ATOM BOMB IN NASHVILLE. THE GUY THAT RAN COLUMBIA AT THE TIME, RICK BLACKBURN, EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE DEVIL. BECAUSE JOHNNY CASH WAS MORE THAN AN ARTIST. HE WAS A WAY OF LIFE FOR AMERICA. MAN: IT WAS REGRETTABLE AND REPREHENSIBLE THAT HE WAS JUST KIND OF SUMMARILY, DISRESPECTFULLY DISMISSED AND CAST ASIDE BY A LABEL THAT HAD MADE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH JOHNNY CASH'S MUSIC. THE FACT THAT COLUMBIA RECORDS WOULD DROP JOHNNY CASH WAS AN INSULT TO ANYBODY WHO HAD EVER LISTENED TO MUSIC. ["I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T WANT ME" BY ROSANNE CASH PLAYS] NARRATOR: MEANWHILE, CASH'S ELDEST DAUGHTER, ROSANNE, WAS CARVING OUT HER OWN CAREER IN COUNTRY MUSIC. SHE CARRIED PAINFUL MEMORIES OF HER FATHER'S NEGLECT IN THE 1960s, WHEN HE WAS STRUNG OUT ON DRUGS AND NEVER AT HOME. ROSANNE CASH: ♪ I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T WANT ME... ♪ NARRATOR: BUT SHE ALSO SHARED HIS DEEP LOVE OF MUSIC AND HIS FIERCE INDIVIDUALISM. ROSANNE CASH: IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I DO IT ON MY OWN. EVEN THOUGHT OF CHANGING MY NAME, AND MY DAD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. HE KNEW I WAS CONSIDERING THAT. AND THEN WHEN I DIDN'T, HE SAID, "I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU KEPT YOUR NAME," YOU KNOW? "I'M SO PROUD OF OUR NAME. I'M SO HAPPY YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT UP." AND I REALIZE THAT WOULD HAVE HURT HIM TERRIBLY. NARRATOR: SHE AND HER HUSBAND, RODNEY CROWELL, WHO WAS ALSO HER PRODUCER, HAD MOVED FROM LOS ANGELES TO NASHVILLE, WHERE SHE HAD TROUBLE FITTING IN. ROSANNE CASH: WHEN I MOVED TO NASHVILLE, I HAD PURPLE HAIR. I WAS A LITTLE BIT STREETWISE, URBAN GIRL, STRAIGHT FROM LOS ANGELES, AND, YOU KNOW, BRAZEN. JUST CAME ON THE SCENE, LIKE, "WELL, HERE I AM," AND, "THIS IS GREAT." AND I REALLY PUT PEOPLE OFF. NARRATOR: BUT HER SONG "I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T WANT ME" WENT TO NUMBER ONE AND WON A GRAMMY. ROSANNE CASH: ♪ I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T WANT ME... ♪ ♪ I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU... MAN: SHE WAS SELLING RECORDS. AND THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING HER MUSIC. AND THAT WILL ENDEAR YOU TO THE ESTABLISHMENT PRETTY QUICK BECAUSE IT ADDS TO THE BOTTOM LINE. SO YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH RESPECT YOU GET WHEN YOUR RECORDS ARE SELLING. AND YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED HOW LITTLE YOU GET WHEN THEY'RE NOT. ["TENNESSEE FLAT TOP BOX" BY ROSANNE CASH PLAYS] NARRATOR: ROSANNE CASH'S NEWEST ALBUM WENT GOLD AND PRODUCED 4 CONSECUTIVE NUMBER ONE SINGLES, INCLUDING "TENNESSEE FLAT TOP BOX," A SONG HER FATHER HAD FIRST RECORDED IN 1961. ROSANNE CASH: ♪ ...A LITTLE DARK-HAIRED BOY ♪ ♪ WHO PLAYED THE TENNESSEE FLAT TOP BOX... ♪ I FELT KIND OF GUILTY THAT MY CAREER WAS REALLY--I WAS GETTING-- HAVING A LOT OF NUMBER ONE RECORDS AND GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION AT THE SAME TIME MY DAD WAS DROPPED FROM COLUMBIA AND HE WAS REALLY FLOUNDERING. I FELT BAD FOR HIM BECAUSE HE PUT A LOT OF STOCK IN BEING JOHNNY CASH. AND TO NOT HAVE THAT, HE WAS A LITTLE DISCONCERTED AND AT SEA AND DEPRESSED. ["MY LONG JOURNEY HOME" BY THE MONROE BROTHERS PLAYS] MONROE BROTHERS: ♪ DARK AND A-RAININ' ♪ AND I GOT TO GO HOME ♪ GOT TO GO HOME, OH, WE GOT TO GO HOME ♪ ♪ DARK AND A-RAININ' ♪ AND I GOT TO GO HOME ♪ I'M ON MY LONG JOURNEY HOME IN ALL THINGS COUNTRY MUSIC, WE SEE A RESPONSE. HOW FAR ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE COUNTRY MUSIC? WELL, IT'LL COME BACK AROUND AGAIN. IT'S ALWAYS REMINDING ITSELF WHO IT IS. AND THE OLD GHOSTS ARE ALWAYS RISING UP AND REFUSING TO BE CAST ASIDE. MONROE BROTHERS: ♪ GOT TO GO HOME ♪ OH, WE GOT TO GO HOME ♪ IT'S DARK AND A-RAININ', AND I GOT TO GO HOME ♪ ♪ I'M ON MY LONG JOURNEY HOME THERE IS A TENSION, ALWAYS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S HOW BIG CAN YOU MAKE YOUR AUDIENCE, YOU KNOW, AND HOW PURE YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HEART. I THINK THE WAY COUNTRY MUSIC WAS PUFFED UP AND SO HUNG UP ON ITSELF AND ITS SOUND AND ITS CITY AND ITS IMAGE, AND ALL THAT, YOU KNOW? I THINK MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE PRIDEFUL, AND WE NEED TO HAVE A HEART CHECK. ["HIGHWAY 40 BLUES" BY RICKY SKAGGS PLAYS] NARRATOR: RICKY SKAGGS WAS FROM EASTERN KENTUCKY. A PRODIGY ON THE MANDOLIN, HE HAD PLAYED FOR BILL MONROE AT AGE 6, APPEARED ON THE FLATT AND SCRUGGS TELEVISION SHOW WHEN HE WAS 7; AND AS A TEENAGER JOINED RALPH STANLEY AND THE CLINCH MOUNTAIN BOYS. NO ONE HAD MORE IMPECCABLE BLUEGRASS CREDENTIALS THAN HE DID. SKAGGS: ♪ SQUANDERED YOUTH IN SEARCH OF TRUTH ♪ ♪ BUT IN THE END, I HAD TO LOSE, GOT THE HIGHWAY 40 BLUES... ♪ NARRATOR: BUT IN THE LATE 1970s, SKAGGS HAD MOVED TO LOS ANGELES TO BE PART OF EMMYLOU HARRIS' HOT BAND, INFUSING HER MUSIC WITH A TINGE OF BLUEGRASS, AND EXPERIMENTING WITH A SOUND THAT COMBINED THE ACOUSTIC INSTRUMENTS OF A STRING BAND WITH SOMETHING MORE ELECTRIC, MORE HONKY TONK. IT WAS TRADITIONAL, AND IT WAS BRAND-NEW. SKAGGS: WELL, THE BLUEGRASS PURISTS WERE, THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE ELECTRIC PART. THEY REALLY DIDN'T. AND IT WAS SO COUNTRY. I MEAN, IT WAS BARNYARD. YOU COULD SMELL IT. IT WAS SO COUNTRY. NARRATOR: SKAGGS ENJOYED NOTHING BETTER THAN TAKING A SONG THAT ONE OF HIS BLUEGRASS HEROES HAD WRITTEN AND RECORDED A GENERATION EARLIER AND INJECTING IT WITH SOMETHING FRESH. [STRUMMING MANDOLIN] SKAGGS: ♪ WELL, I GOT A GAL THAT'S SWEET TO ME ♪ ♪ SHE JUST AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE ♪ ♪ JUST A LITTLE HIGH HEADED ♪ THAT'S PLAIN TO SEE ♪ DON'T GET ABOVE YOUR RAISIN' ♪ STAY DOWN TO EARTH WITH ME THAT IS JUST A BAD SONG! THAT IS SO BAD. I LOVE THAT SONG. THAT WAS A FLATT AND SCRUGGS SONG THAT EARL JUST ATE THE BANJO UP ON. I FELT LIKE THAT SONG COULD BE A SLAMMING KIND OF COUNTRY SONG. ♪ OH, WELL, I GOT A GAL THAT'S SWEET TO ME ♪ ♪ AND SHE JUST AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE ♪ ♪ SHE'S JUST A LITTLE HIGH HEADED ♪ ♪ THAT'S PLAIN TO SEE ♪ DON'T GET ABOVE YOUR RAISIN' ♪ STAY DOWN TO EARTH WITH ME ♪ "NOW, LOOKIE HERE, GAL," THEN SHE HIGH-HATTED ME ♪ ♪ I AIN'T FORGOT WHAT YOU USED TO BE... ♪ SKAGGS, VOICE-OVER: YOU KNOW, THE SCRIPTURES TELL US, YOU KNOW, BE HUMBLE. YOU KNOW, GOD DOESN'T EXALT PRIDE, BUDDY. HE EXALTS HUMILITY. ♪ STAY DOWN TO EARTH WITH ME ♪ ["UNCLE PEN" BY RICKY SKAGGS PLAYS] NARRATOR: DURING THE MID-1980s, SKAGGS RELEASED A STEADY STRING OF TOP HITS, INCLUDING A REMAKE OF A SONG HIS MENTOR, BILL MONROE, HAD WRITTEN BACK IN 1950 ABOUT MONROE'S MENTOR, UNCLE PEN. MONROE'S VERSION HAD NEVER CHARTED; SKAGGS' JUMPED TO NUMBER ONE. SKAGGS: ♪ UNCLE PEN PLAYED THE FIDDLE, LORD, HOW IT RANG ♪ ♪ YOU COULD HEAR IT TALK, YOU COULD HEAR IT SING... ♪ SKAGGS: "UNCLE PEN" WAS THE FIRST SOLO BLUEGRASS SONG TO EVER REACH NUMBER ONE. SO I WAS AT THE OPRY ONE NIGHT, AND MR. MONROE COME UP TO ME, AND HE SAID, "UH, RICKY, UH, BOY, UH, I JUST GOT A POWERFUL CHECK ON THAT SONG 'UNCLE PEN,' THAT SONG YOU PUT OUT." AND HE SAID, "I'M TELLING YOU, IT WAS A POWERFUL CHECK NOW." HE SAID, "I PAID ALL MY LAND TAXES," AND HE SAID, "I GOT SOME LEFT OVER." AND, UH, "YOU CAN RECORD ALL MY SONGS IF YOU WANT TO." UNCLE PEN? NARRATOR: MONROE EVEN AGREED TO APPEAR IN A MUSIC VIDEO FOR SKAGGS' SONG "COUNTRY BOY," PRETENDING TO BE UNCLE PEN PAYING A VISIT TO HIS NEPHEW IN NEW YORK CITY. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D SINK TO THIS. SON, YOU'RE GETTING WAY ABOVE YOUR RAISIN' IS WHAT'S GOING ON. AND IT'S A SAD SIGHT. WELL, UNCLE PEN, I'LL SHOW YOU. SKAGGS, VOICE-OVER: HE PLAYED THE ROLE SO GREAT. AND WHEN HE CHEWED ME OUT IN THAT LAWYER'S ROOM FOR BEING ALL DRESSED UP AND KIND OF GOT ABOVE MY RAISIN', YOU KNOW, A LITTLE BIT, HE DID IT SO PERFECT. ♪ I MAY LOOK LIKE A CITY SLICKER ♪ ♪ SHININ' UP THROUGH ME SHOES ♪ ♪ UNDERNEATH I'M JUST A COTTON PICKER ♪ ♪ PICKIN' OUT A MESS OF BLUES... ♪ SKAGGS, VOICE-OVER: IT HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS OF FUN. IT HAD BREAK DANCING. IT HAD ED KOCH EATING A BAGEL, SINGING "I'M JUST A COUNTRY BOY AT HEART." SKAGGS: ♪ I'M JUST A COUNTRY BOY ♪ ♪ COUNTRY BOY AT HEART ♪ SKAGGS: WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, UNCLE PEN? MONROE: I GUESS YOU'RE STILL A COUNTRY BOY. ["AMARILLO BY MORNING" BY GEORGE STRAIT PLAYS] NARRATOR: BUT THERE WERE OTHER YOUNG ARTISTS WHO WERE ALSO RECONNECTING COUNTRY MUSIC WITH ITS ROOTS AND HAVING GREAT SUCCESS. GEORGE STRAIT WAS RAISED ON A RANCH NEAR HIS BIRTHPLACE OF POTEET, TEXAS. HIS MUSIC HAD AN OLD-FASHIONED DANCE HALL FEEL TO IT, ANCHORED BY HIS SMOOTH, EASY VOICE AND NO-FRILLS APPROACH. ♪ AMARILLO BY MORNING ♪ UP FROM SAN ANTONE ♪ EVERYTHING THAT I GOT ♪ IS JUST WHAT I'VE GOT ON... ♪ GARTH BROOKS: I WAS GOING TO THE STORE WITH MY DAD, AND I REMEMBER COMING OUT OF TURTLE CREEK, UP THERE WHERE I WAS GOING TO TAKE A LEFT BY THE BLUE CHURCH, HEADING NORTH TO SNYDER'S IGA. AND DAD HAD THIS RADIO ON, KIND OF A.M. AND THIS LADY SAID, "HERE'S A NEW KID FROM TEXAS, AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE HIS SOUND." AND IT WAS GEORGE STRAIT. STRAIT: ♪ THEY TOOK MY SADDLE IN HOUSTON ♪ ♪ BROKE MY LEG IN SANTA FE... BROOKS: AND IT WAS THAT DAY, I LOOKED AND SAID, "THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE."

[APPLAUSE] ["DIGGIN' UP BONES" BY RANDY TRAVIS PLAYS] RANDY TRAVIS: ♪ LAST NIGHT I DUG YOUR PICTURE ♪ ♪ OUT FROM OUR OLD DRESSER DRAWER ♪ ♪ SET IT ON THE TABLE ♪ I READ SOME OLD LOVE LETTERS... ♪ NARRATOR: IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, RANDY TRAVIS BARELY SURVIVED A TROUBLED YOUTH-- DRUGS, ALCOHOL, SCRAPES WITH THE POLICE. THEN "LIB" HATCHER, THE MANAGER OF A LOCAL CLUB WHERE HE WAS SINGING, INTERVENED AND PROMISED AUTHORITIES SHE WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR KEEPING HIM OUT OF TROUBLE. HATCHER BROUGHT HIM TO NASHVILLE, WHERE PRODUCERS ADMIRED HIS DEEP BARITONE VOICE, BUT THOUGHT IT HAD TOO MUCH TWANG IN IT AND UNIFORMLY TURNED HIM DOWN. FINALLY, IN 1986, ONE LABEL RELENTED, AND TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE, HIS DEBUT ALBUM ENDED UP SELLING 3 MILLION COPIES.

BECAUSE THE WAY I TALK AND THE WAY I SING, I CAN'T CROSS OVER THAT MUCH. UM, IT'S A BIG OLD BAR THAT COMES UP. THE BARRIERS DO COME UP. NARRATOR: REBA McENTIRE GREW UP ON AN 8,000-ACRE CATTLE RANCH NEAR KIOWA, OKLAHOMA. HER FATHER, A 3-TIME WORLD-CHAMPION CALF ROPER, TAUGHT HIS 4 CHILDREN TO WORK HARD AND LOVE HORSES. HER MOTHER TAUGHT THEM TO HARMONIZE AND LOVE MUSIC. BY HIGH SCHOOL, REBA WAS PERFORMING WITH A BROTHER AND SISTER AS THE SINGING McENTIRES, AND COMPETING IN RODEOS AS A BARREL RACER. ♪ O, SAY, DOES THAT STAR-SPANGLED BANNER ♪ ♪ YET WAVE... NARRATOR: WHEN SHE SANG THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT THE NATIONAL FINALS RODEO IN 1974, HER VOICE PROMPTED AN INVITATION TO NASHVILLE, WHERE SHE SIGNED A RECORDING CONTRACT AND RELEASED SEVERAL ALBUMS. BUT AS THE YEARS WENT BY, SHE GREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY HER LABEL TRIED TO MOLD HER INTO A COUNTRYPOLITAN-STYLE ARTIST. OF COURSE, ME BEING A STRONG-WILLED THIRD CHILD OUT OF 4 KIDS AND A REDHEAD, AND I HAD MY OWN OPINION OF HOW THINGS WOULD BE DONE. ["SOMEBODY SHOULD LEAVE" BY REBA McENTIRE PLAYS] NARRATOR: IN 1984, A NEW LABEL FINALLY LISTENED TO HER. McENTIRE: AND I SAID I WOULD REALLY LIKE THINGS MORE COUNTRY. I DON'T WANT ORCHESTRA AND VIOLINS. I WANT A STEEL GUITAR AND A FIDDLE. McENTIRE: ♪ SOMEBODY SHOULD LEAVE ♪ BUT WE HATE TO GIVE IN... McENTIRE: I WANTED THE HELP TO BRING COUNTRY MUSIC BACK TO MORE TRADITIONAL. SO THAT WAS, BOY, THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING THAT I LOVED-- GEORGE STRAIT, RICKY SKAGGS, RANDY TRAVIS.

NARRATOR: JUST AS LORETTA LYNN HAD DONE IN THE 1960s, MANY OF McENTIRE'S HITS TOUCHED ON ISSUES WOMEN ALL OVER AMERICA WERE FACING: DEALING WITH A TROUBLED MARRIAGE IN "SOMEBODY SHOULD LEAVE" OR DECIDING TO FINISH THEIR EDUCATION AFTER STARTING A FAMILY IN "IS THERE LIFE OUT THERE." McENTIRE: ♪ SHE MARRIED WHEN SHE WAS 20 ♪ ♪ SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS READY ♪ NOW SHE'S NOT SO SURE... McENTIRE: I WOULD BE DOING THAT SONG ONSTAGE, AND WOMEN WOULD STAND UP IN THE AUDIENCE, HOLD UP THEIR DIPLOMA. THEY'D WRITE ME LETTERS SAYING, "I DIDN'T GET TO GO TO COLLEGE. "I DIDN'T GET MY HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. "AND SO WHEN THE KIDS GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE, I WENT BACK AND GOT MY GED." AND THEY SAID, "THAT SONG INSPIRED ME." ["SWEET DREAMS" BY REBA McENTIRE PLAYS] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NARRATOR: ONE NIGHT AFTER A CONCERT IN SAN DIEGO, 8 MEMBERS OF McENTIRE'S BAND PERISHED IN AN AIRPLANE ACCIDENT-- THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY FOR THE CLOSE-KNIT COUNTRY MUSIC FAMILY SINCE PATSY CLINE WAS KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH IN 1963, AFTER A CONCERT IN WHICH CLINE HAD INTRODUCED A NEW SONG OF HERS, "SWEET DREAMS." McENTIRE: ♪ ...WHY CAN'T I FORGET... "SWEET DREAMS" WAS THE LAST SONG I SANG IN, UM, SAN DIEGO IN MARCH OF '91, WHEN THE PLANE CRASH HAPPENED. THAT WAS THE LAST SONG I GOT TO SING WITH THAT BAND.

AND YOU DO IT. YOU DO IT WITH A SMILE, BUT YOU WIN. ["GRANDPA" BY THE JUDDS PLAYS] NAOMI JUDD: REBA WAS DISCOVERED SINGING THE "STAR-SPANGLED BANNER" AT RODEOS. GEORGE WAS A REAL COWBOY DOWN IN SAN MARCOS, TEXAS. WE WERE REAL. WE DIDN'T NEED A FOCUS GROUP OR A MARKETING MEETING AND ANY OF THAT-- ANY OF THAT KIND OF STUFF. AND PEOPLE WERE HUNGRY FOR THAT. THE JUDDS: ♪ GRANDPA ♪ TELL ME 'BOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS ♪ ♪ SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE ♪ THIS WORLD'S GONE CRAZY ♪ GRANDPA ♪ TAKE ME BACK TO YESTERDAY... NARRATOR: NAOMI JUDD WAS A DIVORCED MOTHER OF TWO STRONG-WILLED DAUGHTERS, WYNONNA AND ASHLEY, LIVING IN LOS ANGELES, WHEN SHE DECIDED TO MOVE BACK TO HER NATIVE KENTUCKY IN 1976. NAOMI JUDD: WYNONNA WAS 12, ASHLEY WAS 8. AND I HAD TAKEN THEM BACK HOME TO A MOUNTAINTOP IN KENTUCKY TO EXPOSE THEM TO THEIR ANCESTRY. I WANTED TO REALLY SORT OF PLUG THE KIDS INTO THEIR INCREDIBLY RICH EIGHTH-GENERATION KENTUCKY HERITAGE. SO WE LIVED ON A MOUNTAINTOP, MORRILL, KENTUCKY. VERY ISOLATED. THE JUDDS: ♪ TELL ME 'BOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS... ♪ WYNONNA JUDD: WE LIVED IN A HOME THAT A WOMAN RENTED TO US FOR A $100 A MONTH, BUT IT HAD HANDMADE QUILTS ON THE BED; IT HAD...BLACKBERRY BUSHES IN THE BACK AND APPLE TREES. IT WAS A PARADISE, YET WE HAD NOTHING. WE CUT OUR OWN HAIR; WE GREW A GARDEN. MY MOTHER MADE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH. IF WE DIDN'T MAKE IT OR GROW IT, WE DIDN'T HAVE IT. I MEAN, IT WAS SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE. NO TV, NO TELEPHONE. IT WAS ALL ABOUT CREATIVITY AND SPENDING TIME IN THE QUIET OF THE WILDERNESS. NAOMI JUDD: IT WAS IN THAT SPLENDID SOLITUDE THAT I HANDED THE 12-YEAR-OLD NEMESIS-- UM, I HANDED WYNONNA A PLASTIC STRING GUITAR, AND VOILA! THE TRUTH IS, I WASN'T INTO MUSIC. I WAS NOT INTO EVEN BEING A SINGER. I JUST WAS BORED OUT OF MY MIND LIVING ON A MOUNTAINTOP WITH A, YOU KNOW, SINGLE PARENT AND A SISTER WHO WOULDN'T LEAVE ME THE HECK ALONE. AND I THINK THE GUITAR BECAME MY FRIEND BECAUSE I WAS JUST SO LONESOME. THE JUDDS: ♪ ...LOVERS REALLY FALL IN LOVE TO STAY? ♪ ♪ STAND BESIDE EACH OTHER COME WHAT MAY? ♪ ♪ WAS A PROMISE REALLY SOMETHING PEOPLE KEPT ♪ ♪ NOT JUST SOMETHING THEY WOULD SAY... ♪ NARRATOR: WHILE WYNONNA PRACTICED HER GUITAR, NAOMI STUDIED NURSING, AND THE TWO OF THEM MANAGED TO EASE SOME OF THEIR MOTHER-DAUGHTER TENSIONS BY LEARNING TO HARMONIZE TOGETHER. WYNONNA JUDD: I WOULD LEARN A SONG AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE'D BE RIGHT BEHIND ME, HUMMING OR SINGING ALONG. AND I'D BE, LIKE, "OK." AND THEN IT BECAME A THING. PEOPLE STARTED ASKING US TO SING AT FAMILY GATHERINGS, AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW... THE JUDDS: ♪ TELL ME 'BOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS ♪ NAOMI JUDD: WE WERE STUDYING THE DELMORE BROTHERS, AND THEY HAD THE MOST TEMPESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP. AND IT OCCURRED TO ME, IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORD "KINDRED," IT'S "DREAD OF KIN." HMM! HA HA! AND LORD KNOWS, THERE ARE MANY TIMES WYNONNA AND I COULDN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER, BUT WE COULD SING TOGETHER. SO, YEAH, SHE STARTED TO HARMONIZE WITH ME, AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO REALIZE, "OK. HERE WE GO." ["WHY NOT ME" BY THE JUDDS PLAYS] NARRATOR: THEY MOVED TO NASHVILLE, WHERE THEY APPEARED ON A LOCAL TELEVISION SHOW AT 5:30 EACH MORNING, BEFORE NAOMI WENT TO WORK AT A HOSPITAL AND WYNONNA WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL.

I JUST WASN'T USED TO BEING IN A BOARDROOM FULL OF MEN. AND I FELT VERY, UM... I GUESS THE WORD IS "GUILTY." I FELT GUILTY THAT I HAD PUT HER IN THAT SITUATION. I MEAN, SHE WAS ONLY LIKE 17 1/2 YEARS OLD. AND SHE WAS TERRIFIED. I MEAN, LIKE TERRIFIED IN A BAD WAY, JUST FROZEN, AND I LOOKED AT HER, AND I SAID, "OK. HERE YOU GO, KIDDO.

MALONE: THE NEO-TRADITIONALISTS, I THINK THERE WAS JUST A GENERAL FEELING AMONG MANY PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE DONE TO REVITALIZE COUNTRY MUSIC AND MOVE IT AWAY FROM WHAT SEEMED TO BE JUST AN ALL-OUT, UNENDING FUSION WITH POP MUSIC. SECOR: THE NEW TRADITIONALISTS WERE THERE BECAUSE COUNTRY HAD NOW GONE SO FAR INTO POP MUSIC AND WAS SO CONSUMED WITH MAKING A BUCK THAT WE HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO CRY IN OUR BEER. I MEAN, WE HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO GO HONKY TONKING. TRAVIS: ♪ ...FOREVER AND EVER ♪ FOREVER AND EVER ♪ AMEN ["SEND ME THE PILLOW YOU DREAM ON" BY HANK LOCKLIN PLAY] YOAKAM: MY EARLIEST MEMORY, PROBABLY AT 3, 4 YEARS OLD, WAS WEDGED IN THAT GREAT KIND OF WOMB-LIKE SQUISH THAT YOU'LL GET BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR AUNT.

INSPIRED BY THE EARLY RECORDS THAT EMMYLOU HARRIS WAS RECORDING, HE MOVED TO LOS ANGELES. YOAKAM: THE BEACON THAT I NAVIGATED TOWARD WAS EMMYLOU HARRIS. YOAKAM: I WOULD NOT HAVE BECOME THE ARTIST I BECAME WITHOUT HER FIRST TWO ALBUMS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE DIRECT TISSUE CONNECTION, MUSICALLY, TO BUCK OWENS AND MERLE HAGGARD FOR MY GENERATION.

HE PREFERRED HARD-CORE HONKY TONK TUNES AND THE BAKERSFIELD SOUND THAT WAS POPULAR IN THE 1960s. BUT IT WAS THE EARLY 1980s, AND THEY WERE CONSTANTLY TOLD TO PERFORM MORE POPULAR MAINSTREAM SONGS. THEY REFUSED. WHEN THEY WERE FIRED, THE BAND CHANGED ITS NAME TO DWIGHT YOAKAM AND THE BABYLONIAN COWBOYS. YOAKAM: ♪ 'CAUSE THEY'D LEARNED READIN', RIGHTIN'... ♪ NARRATOR: THEY FOUND WORK WITHIN L.A.'s POST-PUNK ROCK SCENE, OPENING FOR GROUPS LIKE THE BLASTERS, GUN CLUB, AND LOS LOBOS.

YOAKAM: ♪ NOW, IT'S GUITARS ♪ CADILLACS ♪ AND HILLBILLY MUSIC ♪ LONELY, LONELY STREETS I CALL HOME... ♪ WARNER MUSIC-NASHVILLE, WAS NOT PREPARED TO HAVE US RELEASE A SONG WITH THE TERM "HILLBILLY MUSIC" IN IT.

I AM PROUD OF IT BECAUSE MY-- I WATCHED-- I WATCHED MY OWN FAMILY SUBMITTED TO RIDICULE AND BEING CALLED HILLBILLIES. BUT, GENERATIONALLY, I DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPEN WOUND.

BUT YOAKAM'S OUTSPOKENNESS PUT HIM AT ODDS WITH SOME INDUSTRY INSIDERS IN NASHVILLE. HE HAD USED A STRING OF PROFANITIES WHEN REPORTERS ASKED HIM ABOUT JOHNNY CASH BEING DROPPED BY HIS LABEL, AND HIS OPINIONS ABOUT MUSIC ROW'S SMOOTH COUNTRYPOLITAN SOUND WERE EQUALLY HARSH. DARIUS RUCKER: DWIGHT YOAKAM WAS A BIG INFLUENCE ON ME. HE AIN'T AFRAID TO BE OLD-SCHOOL DIRT COUNTRY ALL THE TIME. HE AIN'T AFRAID TO SING ABOUT ANY SUBJECT HE WANTS TO SING ABOUT. AND IT CHANGED THE WAY I HEARD MUSIC. I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID, "I'M GOING TO MAKE A COUNTRY RECORD SOMEDAY. I WANT TO DO THIS." NARRATOR: IN 1988, BUCK OWENS, WHO HAD ALSO CHAFED AT WHAT HE CONSIDERED NASHVILLE'S SLIGHTS TOWARD COUNTRY ARTISTS FROM CALIFORNIA, ASKED HIS YOUNG FRIEND TO PERFORM WITH HIM AT THE CMA AWARDS. YOAKAM: AND HE CALLED ME UP AND SAID, "DWIGHT, "I'VE GOT THIS SONG THAT WE NEED TO GO SING ON THE CMA AWARDS. "IT'S CALLED 'STREETS OF BAKERSFIELD.' IT'S A GOOD ONE."

ITS FOUNDER WAS AMY KURLAND, THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE LEADING SESSION MUSICIANS IN NASHVILLE'S RECORDING STUDIOS.

I WANTED TO BE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS, AND HE SAID, "IF YOU'LL PUT IN A STAGE, ME AND ALL MY BUDDIES WILL PLAY THERE FOR YOU." I WAS JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY BOYFRIEND HAPPY. HA HA!

KURLAND HELD AUDITIONS FOR ASPIRING SONGWRITERS, THEN ADDED A SPECIAL WRITERS IN THE ROUND IN WHICH THEY SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AUDIENCE RATHER THAN ON A STAGE, AND EXCHANGED STORIES AND NEW SONGS. AMY KURLAND: AROUND NASHVILLE, SOMETIMES A SONGWRITER WILL WRITE A GREAT SONG, TAKE IT OUT TO THEIR PUBLISHER OR RECORD LABEL AND BE TOLD, "YEAH, GREAT SONG, BUT THAT'S A BLUEBIRD SONG."

IT WOULD SOON BECOME THE FIRST COUNTRY ALBUM TO HIT 5 MILLION IN SALES. HIS THIRD ALBUM WOULD DEBUT AT NUMBER ONE ON THE POP CHARTS, ANOTHER FIRST FOR A COUNTRY ARTIST, AND SELL MORE THAN 8 MILLION COPIES. REYNOLDS: AND HE DID THIS WITHOUT EVER ONCE ALLOWING HIS RECORD LABEL TO PROMOTE HIS RECORDS ACROSS INTO OTHER MARKETS, LIKE THE POP MARKET AND ALL THAT. HE FELT LIKE HIS LOYALTY WAS TO COUNTRY RADIO, AND HIS ATTITUDE WAS, "LET THEM COME TO US," YOU KNOW? "LET'S BE SO GOOD AT WHAT WE DO THAT THEY COME TO US." MATTEA: AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WAS LIKE THIS GUY IS SELLING OUT THE STADIUMS AND DOING SPECIALS, LIKE, BLOWING THE TOPS OFF RECORD SALES ACROSS THE BOARD, AND HE'S ONE OF US. NARRATOR: IN 1993, BROOKS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD BE DOING A CONCERT AT TEXAS STADIUM. ALL 65,675 SEATS WERE SOLD OUT WITHIN 92 MINUTES... HELLO, TEXAS! BEATING A PREVIOUS RECORD HELD BY PAUL McCARTNEY. A SECOND SHOW WAS ADDED AND SOLD OUT IN THE SAME TIME. SO DID A THIRD. ANGERED WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE EXTRAVAGANT PRICES BEING CHARGED BY SCALPERS, BROOKS ANNOUNCED A FOURTH CONCERT WITH FREE TICKETS. THE 4 CONCERTS WERE LIKE NOTHING ANY COUNTRY STAR HAD EVER DELIVERED. BROOKS: LET'S GET ON IT AND RAISE SOME HELL! NARRATOR: IN FRONT OF THE MASSIVE CROWD, PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST STUNT HE HAD EVER ATTEMPTED, HE REMEMBERED THE FIRST QUEEN CONCERT HE ATTENDED WHEN HE WAS 17. BROOKS: ♪ LIFE IS NOT TRIED, IT IS MERELY SURVIVED ♪ BROOKS, VOICE-OVER: I'M STANDING ON MY CHAIR, AND ALL I WANT THAT WHOLE NIGHT IS FOR FREDDIE MERCURY TO LOOK AT ME FOR 3 SECONDS, SO I CAN GO...

YOU START TO GET TO DO THIS FOR A LIVING, YOU'RE THE GUY THAT GETS TO DO IT FOR A LIVING, AND NOW ALL I DO IS SCAN THE AUDIENCE EVERY NIGHT FOR THAT 3 SECONDS TO GO, "THANK YOU. "THANK YOU. COOLEST GIG EVER. THANK YOU." PRETTY COOL. BROOKS: YEAH! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NARRATOR: STARTING IN 1991, "BILLBOARD" MAGAZINE HAD INSTITUTED A NEW WAY OF GAUGING A RECORD'S SUCCESS. INSTEAD OF TAKING A TELEPHONE POLL OF RECORD STORE CLERKS, IT NOW RELIED ON SOUNDSCAN, WHICH USED BARCODES TO KEEP TRACK OF ACTUAL SALES. WHAT THE NEW SYSTEM PROVED WAS THAT GARTH BROOKS AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES WERE DOING EVEN BETTER THAN ANYONE HAD IMAGINED. YEARWOOD: IF YOU WERE MAKING COUNTRY MUSIC RECORDS IN THE NINETIES, YOU WERE SELLING RECORDS, AND IT WAS LARGELY DUE TO GARTH. NARRATOR: BETWEEN 1989 AND 1991, SALES OF COUNTRY MUSIC HAD DOUBLED FROM $460 MILLION TO NEARLY $1 BILLION. THEN BETWEEN 1991 AND 1994, THEY DOUBLED AGAIN. IN 1995 ALONE, 27 COUNTRY ALBUMS EACH SOLD MORE THAN A MILLION COPIES AND WENT PLATINUM. RADIO STATIONS PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC ATTRACTED SOME 70 MILLION LISTENERS, THE BIGGEST FORMAT ON THE AIRWAVES. FROM CANADA, SHANIA TWAIN BURST ONTO THE SCENE WITH A SASSY PERSONA AND PERFORMANCE STYLE THAT FILLED BIG ARENAS AND SOLD RECORDS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS AS SHE EDGED HER VERSION OF COUNTRY MUSIC FURTHER TOWARD POP AND ROCK. MARY CHAPIN CARPENTER FROM PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, WAS MORE FOLK-ORIENTED BUT STILL HAD 5 PLATINUM ALBUMS. YEARWOOD: ♪ KATIE'S SITTING ON HER OLD FRONT PORCH ♪ NARRATOR: WHEN TRISHA YEARWOOD ARRIVED IN NASHVILLE IN 1985, IT WAS THE FARTHEST SHE HAD EVER BEEN FROM HOME, THE TINY TOWN OF MONTICELLO, GEORGIA, ONLY 300 MILES AWAY.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOR THE RECORD LABELS, THE EXPECTATIONS THAT DEFINED SUCCESS IN COUNTRY MUSIC HAD BALLOONED, BUT THE EXPECTATIONS OF COUNTRY FANS WERE UNCHANGED-- "DON'T GET ABOVE YOUR RAISIN'." FOR MANY YEARS, THE COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION HAD HOSTED FAN FAIR, A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR SOME LIVE MUSIC BUT MOST OF ALL TO MEET THEIR FAVORITE STARS AND GET THEIR AUTOGRAPH. BROOKS: ♪ AROUND THE BEND, SLOWING DOWN, SHE'S JUMPING... ♪ NARRATOR: AT THE PEAK OF HIS UNPRECEDENTED POPULARITY, GARTH BROOKS SHOWED UP, NOT TO PLAY BUT TO SIGN. YEARWOOD: HE WENT OUT THERE UNANNOUNCED. HE DROVE UP IN HIS TRUCK. HE GOT OUT OF HIS TRUCK, AND HE WENT AND STOOD UNDER, YOU KNOW, A TENT SOMEWHERE, NOT A GARTH BROOKS BOOTH, NOT--AND JUST STOOD THERE. MATTEA: AND USUALLY, YOU HAVE A WINDOW, AND EVERYONE KNOWS WHEN IT IS, AND SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET DISAPPOINTED, YOU HAVE SOMEONE STAND AT THE END OF THE LINE AND SAY, "LOOK. WHEN--THIS IS THE LAST PERSON. WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY MORE," BUT GARTH JUST DIDN'T STOP. HE JUST DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO SIGN UNTIL EVERYBODY WAS DONE. YEARWOOD: AND HE STOOD THERE.

THAT WAS ALWAYS HER ADVICE ABOUT COUNTRY MUSIC FANS. YOU LOVE YOUR FANS IN COUNTRY MUSIC, AND THEY WILL LOVE YOU BACK. THEY'RE NOT JUST INVESTING IN A SONG. THEY'RE INVESTING IN YOU AS A PERSON. IT ALL GOES BACK TO THE SONGS. THEY GET WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND THEY ASSOCIATE YOU WITH THAT SONG. YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THEM, EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER MET THEM BEFORE, MATTEA: I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY IT-- THIS STARTED, BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. PART OF THE JOURNEY OF BEING A COUNTRY MUSIC STAR, YOU GO TALK TO YOUR FANS. YOU SIGN AUTOGRAPHS. YOU LOOK THEM IN THE EYE. WHEN YOU LOOK THOSE PEOPLE IN THE EYE, THEY ARE YOU, AND YOU ARE THEM. THERE IS NO BEING ABOVE. PEOPLE COME THROUGH, AND THEY'RE LIKE, "THIS SONG CHANGED MY LIFE." "I HAD THIS SONG SUNG IN MY WEDDING." "MY GRANDMOTHER DIED THE SAME WAY." THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE I WAS SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS, AND THIS WOMAN JUST WALKED UP TO ME IN THE LINE, AND SHE JUST LOOKED AT ME, AND I LOOKED AT HER, AND SHE DIDN'T SAY A WORD, AND SHE JUST STARTED CRYING, TEARS JUST CAME DOWN HER FACE, AND...AND I JUST LOOKED AT HER, AND SHE LOOKED AT ME, AND SHE JUST WENT...

AND HER HUS--AND HER HUSBAND JUST LEANED DOWN, AND HE GRABBED HER ARM WHEN SHE-- THEY WERE WALKING AWAY, AND HE SAID, "SHE BURIED HER MOM THIS MORNING, BUT SHE REALLY WANTED TO COME AND SEE YOU TONIGHT." AND...I MEAN, THAT'S IT, YOU KNOW? THAT'S IT. THAT'S COUNTRY MUSIC. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] REYNOLDS: RECORD LABELS HAVE A TERRIBLE TENDENCY TO CHASE WHATEVER IS THE CURRENT HIT. I MEAN, I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT MARKETING MEN WOULD CLONE TODAY'S NUMBER ONE FOREVER WITHOUT A SENSE OF GUILT IF THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT, UH, JUST BECAUSE IT WOULD ELIMINATE RISK. [FIREWORKS EXPLODE] NARRATOR: COUNTRY MUSIC MAY HAVE BEEN BIGGER THAN EVER, BUT BY THE MID-1990s, RECORD SALES WERE CONCENTRATED ON A SMALLER AND SMALLER NUMBER OF NEW RELEASES. EXECUTIVES AT THE LABELS IN NASHVILLE WERE UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE TO ONLY PRODUCE ALBUMS THAT SOLD IN THE MILLIONS. [PLAYING "ACHY BREAKY HEART"] CROWELL: EXPECTATIONS BECAME PART OF THE CREATIVE DECISION MAKING. BILLY RAY CYRUS: ♪ YOU CAN TELL THE WORLD... ♪ ♪ YOU NEVER WAS MY GIRL THAT MEANS THAT THE RECORD COMPANIES' BOTTOM LINE HAD RISEN TO SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS WITH THE LIKES OF GARTH BROOKS AND SHANIA TWAIN THAT THEIR SHAREHOLDERS WERE NEVER GOING TO BE HAPPY IF THEY WERE OUT TRYING TO DEVELOP A NEW ACT WHO SOLD 1/5 OR 1/100 OF WHAT THOSE ARTISTS SOLD. IT JUST WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. CYRUS: OH! NARRATOR: THEN A CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW ALLOWED LARGE COMPANIES TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR OWNERSHIP OF RADIO STATIONS ACROSS THE NATION. DECISIONS ON WHAT SONGS WOULD BE BROADCAST WERE BEING MADE BY FEWER PEOPLE. PLAYLISTS GOT SHORTER. IT BECAME EVEN HARDER FOR NEW ARTISTS TO BREAK IN AND HARDER FOR MANY ESTABLISHED ARTISTS TO HOLD ON. EDDIE STUBBS: THE DAYS OF AN ARTIST DROPPING IN TO SEE A DISC JOCKEY, LIKE WAS THE CASE WITH LORETTA LYNN, THOSE DAYS ARE VIRTUALLY GONE. REYNOLDS: AND NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES TO GET TO TRY YOUR RECORD OUT AND SEE IF THE PUBLIC WILL RESPOND, YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE, ONE PERSON WHO IS PROGRAMMING FOR 1,300, 1,400 STATIONS, AND HIS SAY-SO IS "THE" SAY-SO, AND IF HE SAYS, "NO," THAT'S IT. EMMYLOU HARRIS: I WAS DOING AN INTERVIEW AT A COUNTRY RADIO STATION. I HAD AN ALBUM OUT, AND LORETTA LYNN HAD JUST BEEN INDUCTED INTO THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME, AND I SAID, "OH, THIS IS SO FANTASTIC. "SO, YOU KNOW, LET'S PLAY SOMETHING BY LORETTA LYNN." HE SAID, "OH, WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE SHE'S NOT ON OUR PLAYLIST." NARRATOR: SOME INDEPENDENT STATIONS STILL EXISTED AND CONTINUED FEATURING ALTERNATIVE COUNTRY ARTISTS, AS WELL AS THE CLASSICS. TO PROVE THAT THIS MUSIC STILL HAD AN AUDIENCE, A NEW TERM HAD TO BE INVENTED, WITH ITS OWN CHART AND LATER ITS OWN AWARDS. IT WAS CALLED AMERICANA. ["BORN TO RUN" BY EMMYLOU HARRIS PLAYS] NARRATOR: NO ONE WAS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THE NEW MOVEMENT THAN EMMYLOU HARRIS. HARRIS: ♪ WELL, I NEVER DID... NARRATOR: 20 YEARS EARLIER, WHEN SHE BECAME A CONVERT TO COUNTRY MUSIC, HER BEST-SELLING ALBUMS, FEATURING SONGS BY OLDER STARS, HAD SHONE A SPOTLIGHT ON WHAT WAS BEING OVERLOOKED.

STUART: IT WAS JUST AN OLD BUILDING WHERE THE GRAND OLE OPRY USED TO BE AND WITH AN OLD HISTORY THAT WAS TIRED, AND THE WINDOWS WERE BROKEN OUT, AND PIGEONS WERE FLYING AROUND, AND THEY CONDUCTED $2.00 TOURS. NARRATOR: WHEN HARRIS AND HER BAND RECORDED THEIR LIVE ALBUM AT THE DECAYING RYMAN, THE CROWD THAT WAS PERMITTED TO WITNESS IT WAS RESTRICTED-- FOR SAFETY REASONS-- TO ONLY 200 PEOPLE, ALL GATHERED NEAR THE STAGE TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THE AUDIENCE WAS MUCH LARGER. ♪ YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN ♪ JOHN ♪ GO ON AFRAID ♪ JOHN ♪ I'LL GO WITH YOU ♪ JOHN THE BAPTIST ♪ THIS IS THE DAY NARRATOR: THE ONLY GUEST SHE INVITED TO PERFORM WITH HER WAS BILL MONROE, THE AGING PATRIARCH OF BLUEGRASS, WHO HAD FIRST APPEARED ON THE RYMAN STAGE BACK IN 1939.

YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT. EVERY GENERATION IS DIFFERENT, BUT WE MUSTN'T FORGET WHERE WE CAME FROM BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE MUSIC THAT WE MAKE IN THE FUTURE BETTER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NARRATOR: THE EVENT AND THE ALBUM THAT IT PRODUCED REMINDED PEOPLE OF THE RYMAN'S INCOMPARABLE ACOUSTICS, AS WELL AS ITS PLACE IN MUSIC HISTORY. HARRIS AND OTHERS JOINED A CAMPAIGN TO SAVE THE RYMAN FROM DESTRUCTION, AND THE OWNERS OF WSM AND THE GRAND OLE OPRY INVESTED MORE THAN $8 MILLION TO COMPLETELY RESTORE IT. ♪ THE MOTHER CHURCH OF COUNTRY MUSIC REOPENED AS A PERFORMANCE VENUE IN 1994 WITH LITTLE JIMMY DICKENS, PORTER WAGONER, AND MARTY STUART CUTTING THE RIBBON.
