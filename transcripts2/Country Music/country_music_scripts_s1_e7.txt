 HER FAVORITE COUNTRY SINGER, MARTY ROBBINS, AND GAVE HIM A COWBOY GUITAR WHEN HE WAS ONLY 3. BY AGE 9, HE HAD MASTERED THE INSTRUMENT AND PERFORMED WHEREVER HE COULD. THE FIRST RECORD YOUNG STUART EVER OWNED WAS BY HIS MUSICAL HERO JOHNNY CASH. AFTER MEETING COUNTRY STAR CONNIE SMITH AT THE LOCAL FAIRGROUNDS WHEN HE WAS 11, HE VOWED TO HIS MAMA THAT HE WOULD MARRY HER SOMEDAY. AT A DIFFERENT CONCERT, BILL MONROE IGNITED A PASSION FOR BLUEGRASS MUSIC AND THE MANDOLIN. STUART: AND HE GAVE ME HIS MANDOLIN PICK. HE SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO PLAY THE MANDOLIN, BOY?" I SAID, "YES, SIR, JUST LIKE YOU." HE SAID, "THIS RIGHT HERE WILL HELP YOU OUT." AND I CARRIED THAT PICK TO SCHOOL WITH ME EVERY DAY LIKE IT WAS KRYPTONITE IN MY POCKET, OR SOMETHING. I FELT SPECIAL BECAUSE I HAD SOMETHING IN MY POCKET THAT NOBODY ELSE HAD AND NOBODY ELSE KNEW ABOUT. NARRATOR: STUART WAS SOON GOOD ENOUGH ON THE MANDOLIN TO IMPRESS A MEMBER OF LESTER FLATT'S BLUEGRASS BAND, WHO SUGGESTED THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY MIGHT TRAVEL WITH THEM. THE CHANCE CAME IN 1972, WHEN HE WAS 13. HE GOT PERMISSION FROM HIS PARENTS TO GO TO NASHVILLE AND TRY OUT FOR LESTER FLATT'S BAND. THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THAT HE HAD TO TAKE A BUS, NOT THE TRAIN. IT DROPPED HIM OFF IN DECAYING DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE, NOT FAR FROM THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM, AT TWO IN THE MORNING. STUART: 2:00 IN THE MORNING, ON ANY NIGHT, AROUND THE RYMAN BACK IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT THE PLACE TO BE. I WALKED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE GREYHOUND STATION AND THERE WAS THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM. THE BUILDING THAT I KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT. AND IT WAS TIRED AND IT WAS WEARY. THE PAINT WAS CRACKED AND SOME OF THE WINDOWS WERE OUT, BUT IT LOOKED BEAUTIFUL TO ME. [MANDOLIN PLAYING] NARRATOR: WITHIN A WEEK, LESTER FLATT BROUGHT HIM ALONG TO PERFORM AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY. STUART: WALKING INTO THE GRAND OLE OPRY WITH LESTER FLATT TOTING HIS GUITAR WAS LIKE WALKING INTO THE VATICAN WITH THE POPE. IT WAS A BIG MOMENT. IT WAS LIKE THAT OLD SCENE IN THE "WIZARD OF OZ" WHERE THE WORLD WENT FROM BLACK AND WHITE TO COLOR. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR ME. EVERYTHING I'D EVER DREAMED OF CAME TRUE WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD. [MANDOLIN PLAYING] AND I PLAYED THE MANDOLIN, AND I WAS SO LITTLE, I HAD TO HOLD THE MANDOLIN WAY UP IN THE AIR LIKE I WAS SHOOTING BIRDS, OR SOMETHING. AT THE END OF THE SONG, THE CROWD JUST KEPT APPLAUDING AND APPLAUDING AND APPLAUDING, AND I THOUGHT I HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG, AND I LOOKED AT LESTER AND I SAID, "WHAT DO I DO?" HE SAID, "DO IT AGAIN." AND I KNEW I HAD FOUND A HOME. AND I KNEW I WAS WHERE I BELONGED AND I WAS WHERE I WANTED TO BE. MEN: ♪ WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE ♪ IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR SOUL? [CROWD CHEERING] ♪ HANK WILLIAMS JR.: ♪ AS LONG AS I CAN ♪ KEEP A LOT OF FRIENDS AROUND ME ♪ MAN: I THINK THERE'S A PARADOX THAT'S ALWAYS EXISTED IN COUNTRY MUSIC. HOW MUCH CHANGE DO YOU EMBRACE? AND HOW MUCH CHANGE CAN YOU MAKE WITHOUT COMPLETELY OBLITERATING WHAT YOU WERE AND WHERE YOU CAME FROM? MAN 2: I DON'T LIKE FENCES BUILT AROUND MUSIC. 'CAUSE FENCES, SURE, THEY... THEY KEEP THINGS OUT, BUT THEY ALSO, UH, THEY DON'T LET THINGS IN. WILLIAMS JR.: ♪ ...STONED AT THE JUKEBOX... ♪ MAN: I THINK THE LINES ARE ONLY IMAGINARY AND THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THERE IN THE BEGINNING. IT'S MUSIC, YOU KNOW? YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S THIS, THAT, OR THE OTHER. IT'S NOT A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. [LAUGHS] NARRATOR: FROM ITS BEGINNINGS, COUNTRY MUSIC HAD NEVER BEEN ONE STYLE. LIKE ALL ART FORMS, IT HAD ALWAYS RESISTED BEING CONFINED WITHIN ARBITRARY BORDERS. AND LIKE ALL ARTISTS, ITS BIGGEST STARS HAD ALWAYS PUSHED THOSE BOUNDARIES TO THEIR LIMITS. WILLIAMS JR.: ♪ AND LORD, I LOVE THAT HURTIN' MUSIC ♪ ♪ 'CAUSE I AM HURTIN', TOO MALONE: AS FANS, WE MAY WANT THEM TO DO THE OLD STUFF. WE'RE UNHAPPY QUITE OFTEN WHEN THEY-- WHEN THEY BRANCH OUT INTO SOMETHING NEW. BUT MUSICIANS, THEY'RE INNOVATIVE. THEY'RE EXPERIMENTAL. THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING FRESH, SOMETHING NEW. OF COURSE, THE QUESTION IS WHERE DOES IT END? WHEN DOES IT CEASE TO BE COUNTRY WHEN THEY'VE MADE ALL THESE CHANGES? ♪ WAYLON JENNINGS: ♪ LORD, IT'S THE SAME OLD TUNE ♪ ♪ FIDDLE AND GUITAR ♪ WHERE DO WE TAKE IT FROM HERE? ♪ ♪ RHINESTONE SUITS AND NEW SHINY CARS ♪ ♪ IT'S BEEN THE SAME WAY FOR YEARS ♪ ♪ WE NEED A CHANGE NARRATOR: IN THE 1970s, DEFINING COUNTRY MUSIC WOULD BE DEBATED AS NEVER BEFORE. BUT THAT ARGUMENT WOULD SPARK ONE OF ITS MOST VIBRANT ERAS-- MAKING ROOM FOR NEW VOICES AND NEW ATTITUDES. AND OUT ON THE EDGES, WHERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC MEET AND MINGLE AND ART IS ALWAYS CREATED, COUNTRY MUSIC WOULD FIND A DRAMATICALLY LARGER AUDIENCE. JENNINGS: ♪ I DON'T THINK HANK DONE IT THIS WAY ♪ NARRATOR: TWO WOMEN FROM NEARLY OPPOSITE BACKGROUNDS WOULD LEAD THE WAY. ONE WOULD COME INTO HER OWN AS A WRITER AND SINGER OF SONGS DRAWN FROM HER IMPOVERISHED CHILDHOOD IN THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE. THE OTHER, FROM THE FOLK CLUBS OF THE EAST COAST, WOULD BECOME AN UNLIKELY CONVERT TO COUNTRY MUSIC-- AND, WITH HER ANGELIC VOICE, CONVERT MILLIONS MORE. TWO MUSICAL OUTCASTS WOULD MAKE THEIR OWN RULES ABOUT WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T COUNTRY MUSIC. ONE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE NASHVILLE TO FIND HIS TRUE VOICE IN TEXAS. THE OTHER WOULD UPEND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTISTS AND THEIR RECORD LABELS IN MUSIC CITY. A MARRIED COUPLE, EACH POSSESSING A REMARKABLE VOICE, WOULD CREATE SOME OF COUNTRY MUSIC'S MOST ENDURING RECORDS WHILE SEEMINGLY LIVING OUT THEIR SONGS' TRAGIC LYRICS. AND, AS A NEW GENERATION OF ARTISTS CAME OF AGE, TWO CHILDREN OF TWO MUSIC LEGENDS-- ONE, THE SON OF THE HILLBILLY SHAKESPEARE, THE OTHER, THE DAUGHTER OF THE MAN IN BLACK-- WOULD STRIKE OUT ON THEIR OWN AND PROVE, AS THEIR FATHERS DID, THAT COUNTRY MUSIC, THOUGH GROUNDED IN TRADITION, HAS ALWAYS BEEN MOVING FORWARD. ♪ ♪ TOM T. HALL: ♪ COUNTRY IS ♪ SITTIN' ON THE BACK PORCH ♪ LISTEN TO THE WHIPPOORWILLS ♪ LATE IN THE DAY NARRATOR: BY THE TIME YOUNG MARTY STUART DEBUTED ON THE GRAND OLE OPRY, THE DECISION HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE THAT THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM WAS NO LONGER SUITED FOR AN ATTRACTION DRAWING 400,000 VISITORS A YEAR. THE FORMER TABERNACLE, OWNED BY THE NATIONAL LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY, WAS NOW MORE THAN 3/4 OF A CENTURY OLD. HALL: ♪ KNOWIN' YOUR KIND MAN: AND THE STREET AROUND THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM AT THAT TIME WAS FULL OF HONKY-TONKS AND STREET WALKERS AND BEGGARS, AND THE FANS, THEY WERE ALL GETTING HIT OUT THERE WHILE THEY'RE WAITING IN LINE TO HOPEFULLY GET A TICKET. AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY GOT VERY SENSITIVE AS TIME WENT ON. AND IT WAS A--IT WAS REALLY A PR PROBLEM. HALL: ♪ COUNTRY IS NARRATOR: FOR YEARS, OPRY MANAGER BUD WENDELL HAD BEEN FIELDING COMPLAINTS FROM THE PERFORMERS ABOUT THEIR CRAMPED WORKING CONDITIONS. "MOST OF MY MEMORIES OF THE RYMAN," ROY ACUFF SAID, "ARE OF MISERY, SWEATING OUT THERE ON THE STAGE, THE AUDIENCE SUFFERING, TOO." HALL: ♪ FIND OUT WHAT'S RIGHT NARRATOR: SUMMERS WERE THE WORST, WHEN TEMPERATURES INSIDE THE UN-AIR-CONDITIONED BRICK BUILDING ROSE TO 100 DEGREES AND HIGHER. STUART: AND LESTER FLATT WENT TO BUD WENDELL AND SAID, "BUD, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT AMONGST OURSELVES "AND WHY DON'T SOME OF US OLDER ARTISTS "GO IN AND PITCH IN AND MAYBE COME UP WITH "AN AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM, OR SOMETHING TO HELP OUT AROUND HERE A LITTLE BIT?" BUD SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT, I THINK, "UH, WELL, "WE'VE CHECKED INTO THAT, LESTER, AND IT'S A LITTLE OVER $2 MILLION." AND LESTER SAID, "AIN'T AS HOT AS I THOUGHT." [LAUGHS] NARRATOR: WENDELL'S BOSSES DECIDED THE BEST SOLUTION WAS TO BUILD A NEW HOME FOR THE OPRY. ON MORE THAN 300 ACRES OF LAND, 6 MILES UP THE CUMBERLAND RIVER FROM DOWNTOWN, THEY SPENT MORE THAN $65 MILLION TO BUILD AN ELABORATE THEME PARK, OPRYLAND USA; A SPRAWLING, 615-ROOM HOTEL; AND THE SPACIOUS GRAND OLE OPRY HOUSE, FULLY AIR-CONDITIONED, WITH COMFORTABLE SEATING FOR 4,400 PEOPLE, 12 DRESSING ROOMS FOR THE ARTISTS, AND A SEPARATE, STATE-OF-THE-ART TELEVISION STUDIO. EVERYTHING WAS BRAND-NEW, EXCEPT FOR A CIRCLE OF OLD WOOD AT THE CENTER OF THE STAGE. IT HAD COME FROM THE RYMAN. ON FRIDAY, MARCH 15, 1974, THE MOTHER CHURCH OF COUNTRY MUSIC HOSTED ITS FINAL GRAND OLE OPRY. MAN: ♪ GOOD-BYE, DEAR, OLD RYMAN ♪ ANDERSON: I'LL NEVER FORGET THE LAST NIGHT AT THE RYMAN. IT WAS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. AND WE WERE GOING TO OPEN AT THE OPRY HOUSE THE NEXT NIGHT, ON SATURDAY. THERE WAS A FEELING THERE OF, UM, IT WAS LIKE A FEELING I'VE NEVER FELT AT THE OPRY BEFORE. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF SADNESS, A LOT OF SADNESS. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF JOY. THERE WAS ANTICIPATION. THERE WAS A FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN. "WELL, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? "ARE WE CUTTING OFF OUR NOSE TO SPITE OUR FACE HERE? IS THIS REALLY WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING?" NARRATOR: BILL ANDERSON SANG HIS BIG HIT, "PO' FOLKS." ROY ACUFF DID "WABASH CANNONBALL" BEFORE INTRODUCING HIS OLD FRIEND MINNIE PEARL. AFTER 8 HALF-HOUR SEGMENTS OF THE OPRY, THE GRAND OLE GOSPEL SHOW TOOK OVER. HANK SNOW WAS A FEATURED GUEST, AS WERE MOTHER MAYBELLE CARTER AND HER DAUGHTERS AND JOHNNY CASH. THE LAST SONG PERFORMED LATE THAT EVENING WAS THE OLD CARTER FAMILY CLASSIC, "WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN." LISTENING TO IT ALL WAS A YOUNG REPORTER FOR "THE NEW YORKER" MAGAZINE, WHO HAD COME TO THE RYMAN TO COVER THE EVENT. GARRISON KEILLOR HAD GROWN UP IN MINNESOTA, 860 MILES AWAY, GLUED TO HIS FAMILY RADIO EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT TO HEAR THE MUSIC AND MINNIE PEARL'S STORIES FROM THE MAKE-BELIEVE TOWN OF GRINDER'S SWITCH. ON THIS NIGHT, KEILLOR WORKED HIS WAY INTO THE BROADCAST ENGINEERS' BOOTH, LEANED AGAINST THE BACK WALL, AND CLOSED HIS EYES. "IT WAS GOOD," HE WROTE, "TO LET THE OPRY GO OUT "THE SAME WAY IT HAD FIRST COME TO ME, THROUGH THE AIR IN THE DARK." THE NEXT NIGHT, THE GRAND OLE OPRY DEBUTED FROM ITS BRAND-NEW HOME IN THE SUBURBS. ♪ FROM THE GREAT ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE WIDE PACIFIC SHORE... ♪ ANDERSON: I GET GOOSE BUMPS EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT NOW, AS THEY PROJECTED A FILM OF ROY ACUFF SINGING "THE WABASH CANNONBALL" FROM BACK IN THE FORTIES. AND THEY'RE SHOWING THIS ON THE SCREEN IN THE NEW OPRY HOUSE. ♪ ...ON THE WABASH CANNONBALL ♪ ANDERSON: AND IT'S JUST QUIET AS A MOUSE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THAT SCREEN BEGINS TO LIFT AND THERE'S ROY ACUFF... ♪ ...ST. LOUIS AND CHICAGO BY THE WAY ♪ ♪ FROM THE HILLS OF MINNESOTA ♪ ♪ WHERE THE RIPPLING WATERS FALL... ♪ AND THEY'RE SINGING THE SAME SONG. IT NEVER MISSED A BEAT. IT WAS FROM THE OLD FILM IN THE FORTIES TO HERE'S ROY ACUFF NOW IN HIS SEVENTIES STILL SINGING "THE WABASH CANNONBALL." I STOOD THERE AND CRIED. I'M ALMOST...I CAN ALMOST SIT HERE AND CRY JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. NARRATOR: THE GUEST OF HONOR THAT NIGHT WAS PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON. IN WASHINGTON, HE WAS EMBROILED IN THE WATERGATE SCANDAL AND IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS. IN NASHVILLE, HE WAS HAPPY TO FIND A FRIENDLY AUDIENCE. FOR YEARS, THE COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION HAD BEEN TELLING ADVERTISING EXECUTIVES AND RADIO STATION OWNERS THAT THE OLD STEREOTYPE OF COUNTRY FANS AS POOR AND UNEDUCATED HILLBILLIES WAS WRONG. "THE FANS OF OUR MUSIC," A CMA OFFICIAL SAID, "ELECT THE PRESIDENTS, RUN THE FACTORIES, "GROW THE FOOD, TRANSPORT OUR GOODS, AND, IN GENERAL, MANIPULATE THE GEARS OF THIS COUNTRY EVERY DAY." "THE "C" IN COUNTRY MUSIC," A BROCHURE ADDED, "MEANS CASH." WHOO! GET UP THERE. ♪ WELL, GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN ♪ NARRATOR: BY 1974, DOLLY PARTON HAD BEEN PERFORMING ON PORTER WAGONER'S SYNDICATED TELEVISION SHOW FOR 7 YEARS. AND DURING ALL 7 OF THEM, WAGONER HAD EXERTED TIGHT CONTROL OVER HER CAREER. ♪ DOWN ON YOUR NEW MUD RUN? HEY, HEY, YEAH ♪ NARRATOR: WAGONER'S OWN STAR AS A COUNTRY SINGER WAS FADING. HIS DUET ALBUMS WITH PARTON OUTSOLD HIS OWN SOLO RECORDS, BUT ON THE ROAD AND IN THE STUDIO, HE INSISTED ON BEING IN CHARGE. "I SIGNED THE CHECKS," HE SAID, "SO, WE DID THINGS MY WAY." ♪ FROM DOWN OLD TENNESSEE WAY, HEY, HEY ♪ ♪ I COME FROM TENNESSEE ♪ NARRATOR: WITH WAGONER PRODUCING, SHE RECORDED THE OLD JIMMIE RODGERS TUNE FROM 1930, "MULE SKINNER BLUES," WHICH BECAME HER FIRST TOP 10 SINGLE. WOMAN: THERE ARE SONGS LIKE THE "MULE SKINNER BLUES" THAT ARE JUST CLASSICS. FROM JIMMIE RODGERS AND HIS VERSION OF IT TO BILL MONROE'S, TO ROSE MADDOX. THERE ARE SONGS LIKE THE "MULE SKINNER BLUES" THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT GO ALL THE WAY BACK. SOMEBODY HEARS THAT AND DADDY LOVED THAT AND GRANDPA LOVED THAT, AND THEY PASS THAT SONG DOWN. IT'S A LITTLE LIKE AN HEIRLOOM. YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN HOLD IN THE FAMILY. THEY'RE LIKE KEEPSAKES. NARRATOR: BUT WAGONER ALSO ENCOURAGED PARTON TO RECORD MORE AND MORE OF THE SONGS SHE HAD WRITTEN HERSELF, STARTING WITH "JOSHUA," WHICH BECAME HER FIRST NUMBER-ONE COUNTRY HIT, AND THEN "COAT OF MANY COLORS" AND "JOLENE." PARTON: ♪ JOLENE, JOLENE, JOLENE, JOLENE ♪ ♪ I'M BEGGING OF YOU, PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY MAN ♪ ♪ JOLENE, JOLENE, JOLENE, JOLENE ♪ ♪ PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN ♪ ♪ YOUR BEAUTY IS BEYOND COMPARE ♪ ♪ WITH FLAMING LOCKS OF AUBURN HAIR ♪ ♪ WITH IVORY SKIN AND EYES OF EMERALD GREEN ♪ ♪ YOUR SMILE IS LIKE A BREATH OF SPRING ♪ ♪ YOUR VOICE IS SOFT LIKE SUMMER RAIN AND I CANNOT... ♪ WOMAN: YOU KNOW WHAT THAT FEELING IS LIKE-- "THAT GIRL'S PRETTIER. IS SHE GOING TO TAKE HIM AWAY?" SHE COULD TAKE HIM AWAY, YOU KNOW. IS HE GOING TO LEAVE? PARTON: ♪ HE TALKS ABOUT YOU IN HIS SLEEP ♪ ♪ AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO TO KEEP ♪ ♪ FROM CRYING WHEN HE CALLS YOUR NAME, JOLENE ♪ SHE'S NOT CURSING HER OUT, SHE'S NOT YELLING AT HER, SHE'S NOT BEING, YOU KNOW, FEISTY AND CAT WOMAN. SHE'S JUST SAYING, "PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY MAN." I MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LINE IN "JOLENE," "PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN." THAT IS SO HEART-WRENCHING. PARTON: ♪ JOLENE, PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM ♪ ♪ EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN, JOLENE... ♪ NARRATOR: IN THE EARLY 1970s, PARTON HAD 5 NUMBER-ONE COUNTRY SOLO HITS, ALL OF THEM SELF-WRITTEN; WAGONER HAD NONE. INSIDERS COULD SEE TENSIONS BUILDING. MAN: DOLLY GOT SMART. I GUESS SHE CAME SMART. I THINK DOLLY LEARNED THAT SHE WAS NOT GOING TO GO ANY FURTHER WITH HER CAREER AS LONG AS SHE WAS IN PORTER'S SHADOW. PARTON: WELL, I THINK PORTER HAD A REAL HARD TIME AFTER OTHER PEOPLE STARTED RECORDING MY SONGS AND I WAS WRITING AND I WAS GETTING TO BE PRETTY POPULAR. AND IT WAS HIS SHOW. I WASN'T TRYING TO HOG IT, BUT I JUST KIND OF CARVED OUT A LITTLE, YOU KNOW, PLACE FOR MYSELF. BUT IT WAS A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP. WE FOUGHT LIKE CATS AND DOGS. WE WERE JUST BOTH VERY PASSIONATE PEOPLE. THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I WASN'T GOING TO DO WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO. AND NO WAY I WAS GOING TO NOT DO WHAT HE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DO. NARRATOR: "PORTER DREAMED OF ME STAYING WITH HIS SHOW FOREVER," PARTON SAID, "AND I DREAMED OF HAVING MY OWN SHOW. "I WROTE MORE AND MORE SONGS AND DREAMED BIGGER AND BIGGER DREAMS." PARTON: WHEN I WAS TRYING TO LEAVE THE SHOW, I HAD TOLD PORTER I'D STAY 5 YEARS. IT HAD BEEN 5, THEN IT WAS 6, THEN IT WAS 7. HE WAS JUST HAVING A REAL HARD TIME 'CAUSE IT WAS GOING TO MESS UP HIS SHOW. WE WERE VERY BOUND AND TIED TOGETHER IN SO MANY EMOTIONAL WAYS. AND HE JUST WOULD NOT HEAR IT. AND SO, HE WAS GOING TO SUE ME; HE WAS GOING TO DO THIS; HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT. AND SO, I WENT HOME AND I THOUGHT, "HE'S NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO ME." 'CAUSE I'VE SAID IT OVER AND OVER. AND SO I THOUGHT, "DO WHAT YOU DO BEST. JUST WRITE A SONG." SO, I WROTE THE SONG, TOOK IT BACK IN THE NEXT DAY, AND I SAID, "PORTER, SIT DOWN. I'VE GOT SOMETHING I HAVE TO SING TO YOU." SO, I SANG IT, AND HE WAS SITTING AT HIS DESK AND HE WAS CRYING. HE SAID, "THAT'S THE BEST THING YOU EVER WROTE." "OK, YOU CAN GO, BUT ONLY IF I CAN PRODUCE THAT RECORD." AND HE DID, AND THE REST IS HISTORY. NARRATOR: RELEASED A FEW MONTHS AFTER SHE LEFT, IT WOULD GO ON TO BECOME DOLLY PARTON'S BEST-SELLING SONG. ♪ IF I SHOULD STAY ♪ I WOULD ONLY BE IN YOUR WAY ♪ SO I'LL GO ♪ BUT I KNOW ♪ I'LL THINK OF YOU EACH STEP OF THE WAY ♪ ♪ AND I ♪ WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU ♪ I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU ♪ EMERY: THAT SONG, IT WAS AN ANTHEM TO PORTER WAGONER. ♪ ...SWEET MEMORIES SHE WROTE IT, I THINK, BECAUSE HE HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER. BUT SHE FELT IF SHE DIDN'T LEAVE HIM, SHE WOULD JUST REMAIN PORTER'S GIRL SINGER. ♪ BUT I ♪ WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU ♪ I WILL... HOLLY WILLIAMS: WRITING A BEAUTIFUL SONG FROM THE MOST SIMPLE WORDS. ♪ LOVE YOU "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU," WHEN SHE SINGS IT OVER AND OVER, IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT ANY OF US CAN RELATE TO. ♪ AND I WISH YOU JOY ♪ SHE WAS ABLE, LIKE HANK WILLIAMS, TO TAKE THE MOST BASIC ONE-LINERS, "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU," AND TURN IT INTO A MASTERPIECE. ♪ I WISH YOU LOVE ♪ AND I ♪ WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU ♪ ♪ I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU ♪ ♪ I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU ♪ [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LORETTA LYNN AND CONWAY TWITTY: ♪ LOVE IS WHERE YOU FIND IT NARRATOR: OTHER FAMOUS DUET TEAMS WERE STAYING TOGETHER. BILL ANDERSON AND JAN HOWARD SOMETIMES WROTE EACH OTHER'S SONGS. DOTTIE WEST, WHO HAD BEEN IN NASHVILLE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, JOINED WITH KENNY ROGERS, WHO HAD RECENTLY ARRIVED. TWITTY: ♪ ...IS ALMOST EMPTY NARRATOR: LORETTA LYNN TEAMED UP WITH CONWAY TWITTY, THE FORMER ROCKABILLY STAR WHO HAD RETURNED TO COUNTRY MUSIC. TOGETHER, THEY RELEASED NEARLY A DOZEN DUET ALBUMS AND HAD 5 NUMBER-ONE SINGLES. LYNN: ♪ WE KNOW IT'S WRONG FOR US TO MEET ♪ ♪ BUT THE FIRE'S GONE OUT AT HOME ♪ TWITTY AND LYNN: ♪ AND THERE'S NOTHIN' COLD AS ASHES ♪ ♪ AFTER THE FIRE IS GONE [APPLAUSE] GEORGE JONES AND TAMMY WYNETTE: ♪ ROLLIN' IN MY SWEET BABY'S ARMS ♪ NARRATOR: BUT NO COUPLE CAPTIVATED AUDIENCES, AND HEADLINES, MORE THAN GEORGE JONES AND TAMMY WYNETTE. JONES AND WYNETTE: ♪ I'LL LAY AROUND THE SHACK ♪ TILL THE MAIL TRAIN COMES BACK ♪ ♪ AND I'LL ROLL IN MY SWEET BABY'S ARMS ♪ ANDERSON: I THINK PEOPLE REALLY FELT LIKE THEY WERE GETTING A LOT OF THE TRUE STORY AND GETTING THE STORY OF THEIR OWN LIVES WHEN THIS INCREDIBLY TALENTED MALE SINGER WAS SINGING WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL AND INCREDIBLY TALENTED FEMALE SINGER, AND THEY'RE SINGING SONGS. ♪ WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON OK, IF, IF THEY CAN HOLD ON, ME AND OLD FRED CAN HOLD ON, TOO. OR ME AND OLD ETHEL, YOU KNOW? AND I THINK PEOPLE SAW THEIR OWN LIVES IN THESE SONGS. JONES AND WYNETTE: ♪ ...SWEET BABY'S ARMS ♪ ROLLING IN MY SWEET BABY'S ARMS, I'LL... ♪ NARRATOR: WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED BACK IN 1969, BOTH TAMMY WYNETTE AND GEORGE JONES WERE ALREADY WELL-KNOWN ARTISTS. BILLED AS "MR. AND MRS. COUNTRY MUSIC," THEY DREW LARGE, ADORING CROWDS. AND THEIR PRODUCER, BILLY SHERRILL, MADE SURE THEY FED THEIR FANS A STEADY STRING OF DUET ALBUMS. MAN: I SEE TAMMY LOOKING AT GEORGE'S LIPS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF HE'S EVER GOING TO DO IT TWICE THE SAME WAY AND DOING HER DAMNEDEST TO PHRASE WITH HIM. AND HIM WITH THAT LITTLE BEADY-EYED POSSUM LOOK ABOUT HIM, LOVING EVERY SECOND OF IT. BOTH: ♪ FOR BETTER OR WORST ♪ YOU'LL ALWAYS COME FIRST ♪ AND NO ONE CAN KEEP US APART ♪ NARRATOR: "WHEN WE WERE ONSTAGE," JONES SAID, "WE WERE IN OUR OWN LITTLE HEAVEN." BOTH: ♪ ...EACH OTHER ♪ FORSAKING ALL OTHERS NARRATOR: BUT THIS WAS A THIRD MARRIAGE FOR BOTH OF THEM, AND IT WAS NEVER TRANQUIL. HIS BINGE DRINKING MADE HIM UNCONTROLLABLE. SHE COULD BE EQUALLY VOLATILE. "HE NIPPED," SHE SAID, "AND I NAGGED." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WOMAN: I WAS FRIENDS WITH BOTH OF THEM WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER. AND I HAVE TO SAY, I THOUGHT, "OH, MY. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS CAN WORK OR NOT." I TRULY THINK THAT GEORGE AND TAMMY HAD A GREAT LOVE AFFAIR. BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY PROBLEMS THAT ARISE FROM TWO STRONG CAREERS, A STRONG DUET CAREER THROWN IN THERE, FAMILY ADDED, AND GEORGE'S DRINKING WAS JUST ALWAYS A PROBLEM, TOO. SO, ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS ADD TO EITHER LIVING OUT A COUNTRY SONG OR WRITING A DAMN GOOD ONE. BOTH: ♪ WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON NARRATOR: IN 1973, WYNETTE FILED FOR DIVORCE. THEY RECONCILED LONG ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GO BACK INTO THE STUDIO AND RECORD "WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON," WHICH ROSE TO NUMBER ONE. BOTH: ♪ ON TO EACH OTHER NARRATOR: SHE WITHDREW HER PETITION. ♪ LIFE CAN BE ROUGH ♪ SOMETIMES IT'S KIND ♪ A REAL GOOD LIFE IS HARD TO FIND ♪ ♪ IT BRINGS US HAPPINESS ALL THROUGH THE DAY ♪ ♪ AND NOTHING'S GONNA EVER MAKE IT GO AWAY ♪ BOTH: ♪ WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON ♪ WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON ♪ WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON TO EACH OTHER ♪ ♪ WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON [APPLAUSE] NARRATOR: TWO YEARS LATER, WYNETTE FILED FOR DIVORCE AGAIN. THIS TIME, THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK. "GEORGE IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T TOLERATE HAPPINESS," SHE TOLD A REPORTER. "IF EVERYTHING IS RIGHT, THERE IS SOMETHING IN HIM THAT MAKES HIM DESTROY IT AND DESTROY ME WITH IT." THEY EACH RELEASED POPULAR ALBUMS, BUT AS SOLO ACTS ON THE ROAD, THEIR BOOKINGS SUFFERED. AT WYNETTE'S CONCERTS, DISAPPOINTED FANS OFTEN SHOUTED OUT, "WHERE'S GEORGE?" WYNETTE: ♪ I MAY SOMETIMES BOTHER YOU, TRY TO BE IN.... ♪ NARRATOR: JONES' DRINKING INCREASED. HE WOULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN IN ONE OF THE 27 CARS HE BOUGHT AND SOLD THAT YEAR, AIMLESSLY CIRCLING THE DRIVEWAY OF THE HOME THE COUPLE HAD ONCE SHARED IN NASHVILLE. SHE EMBARKED ON A SERIES OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED AND SHORT-LIVED ROMANCES-- WITH A MOVIE STAR, A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER, A COUNTRY SINGER, A POLITICIAN, AND OTHERS. AT A RECORDING SESSION IN LATE 1975, SHE RECORDED A SONG SHE LATER CALLED THE FAVORITE OF ALL HER SINGLES-- "TIL I CAN MAKE IT ON MY OWN." WYNETTE: ♪ TIL I CAN MAKE IT ON MY OWN ♪ NARRATOR: AS THE SESSION MUSICIANS GATHERED TO HEAR THE PLAYBACK, NO ONE IN THE STUDIO SPOKE A WORD. "THEY KNEW," WYNETTE RECALLED, "THE SONG WAS ABOUT GEORGE." STILL, 4 MONTHS LATER, BILLY SHERRILL WAS ABLE TO GET THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER FOR ONE MORE DUET ALBUM. ITS TITLE TRACK WAS "GOLDEN RING," WRITTEN BY RAFE VAN HOY AND BOBBY BRADDOCK. MAN: "GOLDEN RING" DOES SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE AN OLD HYMN. IT PROBABLY SOUNDS LIKE 10 OR 12 OLD SOUTHERN GOSPEL HYMNS KIND OF THROWN TOGETHER. WHEN YOU GET TO THE CHORUS, IT'S THAT OLD CHURCH SING-A-LONG THING. ♪ GOLDEN RING, GOLDEN RING, WITH ONE TINY, LITTLE STONE ♪ ♪ CAST ASIDE, CAST ASIDE, LIKE THE LOVE THAT'S DEAD AND GONE ♪ ♪ BY ITSELF, BY ITSELF, JUST A COLD METALLIC THING ♪ ♪ ONLY LOVE CAN MAKE A GOLDEN WEDDING RING ♪ ♪ DOO DOO DOO DOO BOTH: ♪ GOLDEN RING ♪ OOH ♪ WITH ONE TINY, LITTLE STONE ♪ ♪ CAST ASIDE ♪ CAST ASIDE ♪ LIKE THE LOVE THAT'S DEAD AND GONE ♪ ♪ BY ITSELF ♪ BY ITSELF ♪ IT'S JUST A COLD METALLIC THING ♪ ♪ ONLY LOVE CAN MAKE A GOLDEN WEDDING RING ♪ ♪ IN A PAWN SHOP IN CHICAGO ♪ ON A SUNNY SUMMER DAY ♪ A COUPLE GAZES AT THE WEDDING RINGS THERE ON DISPLAY ♪ ♪ GOLDEN RING [APPLAUSE] NARRATOR: "GOLDEN RING" WOULD TOP THE COUNTRY CHARTS. IT WAS PLAYING ON WYNETTE'S CAR RADIO ON THE DAY SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO MARRY HER FOURTH HUSBAND IN 1976. IT WAS STILL ON THE CHARTS WHEN SHE DIVORCED HIM 44 DAYS LATER. BY THIS TIME, THE SMOOTH NASHVILLE SOUND HAD EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING EVEN SMOOTHER. CHARLIE RICH: ♪ MY BABY MAKES ME PROUD ♪ NARRATOR: PEOPLE CALLED IT "COUNTRYPOLITAN," AND PRODUCERS HOPED IT WOULD HELP THEIR ARTISTS CROSS OVER TO THE LUCRATIVE POP MARKET. RICH: ♪ 'CAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ♪ NARRATOR: BILLY SHERRILL WAS MUSIC CITY'S MOST RELIABLE COUNTRYPOLITAN HIT MAKER. HE HELPED CHARLIE RICH, A JOURNEYMAN RHYTHM AND BLUES SINGER, REINVENT HIMSELF AS AN EASY-LISTENING, COUNTRY-POP STAR, AND WHEN HE FOUND TANYA TUCKER, A PRECOCIOUS 13-YEAR-OLD WITH A BIG VOICE, HE GAVE HER SONGS WITH ADULT THEMES THAT RAISED EYEBROWS AMONG COUNTRY MUSIC'S MORE CONSERVATIVE FANS AND CREATED DOZENS OF HIT RECORDS. RICH: ♪ AND SHE MAKES ME GLAD NARRATOR: UP AND DOWN MUSIC ROW, OTHER PRODUCERS, INCLUDING CHET ATKINS AND OWEN BRADLEY, STEERED EVEN FARTHER AWAY FROM COUNTRY'S TWANG. BUT THE BRIDGE TO CROSSOVER SUCCESS WENT BOTH WAYS. OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN: ♪ YOU CAME WHEN I WAS HAPPY IN YOUR... ♪ NARRATOR: AUSTRALIA'S OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN GOT HER CAREER LAUNCHED WHEN HER EARLY POP SONGS WERE PROMOTED TO COUNTRY RADIO STATIONS. IN 1974, SHE WAS NAMED THE COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION'S FEMALE VOCALIST OF THE YEAR, BEATING OUT DOLLY PARTON AND LORETTA LYNN. COUNTRY TRADITIONALISTS WERE SURPRISED AND ANGRY. NEWTON-JOHN: ♪ IF YOU LOVE ME, LET ME KNOW ♪ WOMAN: IT SHOCKED ME. THAT THE MUSIC WAS GETTING AWAY FROM US. WE WERE LOSING...OUR IDENTITY, SO TO SPEAK, I GUESS. NARRATOR: THE FUROR WAS EVEN GREATER AT THE NEXT YEAR'S AWARDS SHOW, WHEN CMA'S TOP HONOR-- COUNTRY MUSIC ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR-- WENT TO A FOLK/POP SINGER WHO WAS WATCHING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. MAN: THE WINNER... [LAUGHTER] MY FRIEND MR. JOHN DENVER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STUART: THINGS WERE CHANGING. AND NOT EVERYBODY AGREED WITH IT. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAW IT AS THE BOUNDARIES WERE BEING BROADENED AND EXPANDED UPON. AND OTHER PEOPLE SAW IT AS THAT COUNTRY MUSIC IS LOSING ITS SOUL. ♪ I'M GOING DOWN TO AUSTIN, TEXAS ♪ ♪ I'M GOING DOWN TO SAVE MY SOUL, GET... ♪ NARRATOR: WHILE OLDER, TRADITIONAL ARTISTS ENGAGED IN A TUG OF WAR WITH THE COUNTRYPOLITANS, NASHVILLE WAS ALSO ATTRACTING A NEW WAVE OF YOUNG SINGER-SONGWRITERS WHO HAD THEIR OWN IDEAS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF COUNTRY MUSIC. ♪ OH, MY, MOMMA, AIN'T THAT TEXAS COOKIN' SOMETHING ♪ ♪ OH, MY, MOMMA, IT'LL STOP YO' BELLY AND BACKBONE BUMPIN' ♪ ♪ OH, MY, MOMMA, AIN'T THAT TEXAS COOKIN' GOOD ♪ ♪ OH, MY, MOMMA, EAT IT EVERY DAY IF I COULD ♪ NARRATOR: FOR THEM, CREATING A WELL-CRAFTED SONG WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WRITING A HIT, THOUGH THEY ALL DREAMED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BOTH, LIKE THE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL KRIS KRISTOFFERSON. AND LIKE KRISTOFFERSON, MANY OF THE NEW ARRIVALS WERE FROM TEXAS. PEOPLE ASK ME AND SAY, "WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE TEXAS SONGWRITERS?" YOU KNOW, "WHAT IS IT?" AND I SAY, "WE'RE THE BEST LIARS IN THE WORLD." TEXANS HAVE ALWAYS HAD THIS INDEPENDENT STREAK OF DOING ... THE WAY THEY WANT IT, THE WAY THEY HEAR IT, THE WAY THEY WANT TO DO IT. NARRATOR: WHEN GUY CLARK WAS A LITTLE BOY IN THE SMALL WEST TEXAS TOWN OF MONAHANS, HIS FAMILY DIDN'T OWN A RECORD PLAYER AND INSTEAD SPENT THEIR EVENINGS READING POETRY ALOUD TO EACH OTHER. CLARK GOT HIS FIRST GUITAR WHEN THEY MOVED TO SOUTH TEXAS, AND THE FIRST SONGS HE LEARNED WERE IN SPANISH. BY HIS EARLY TWENTIES, HE WAS PERFORMING IN FOLK CLUBS AND COFFEE HOUSES AROUND HOUSTON. AFTER A YEAR IN LOS ANGELES, HE RELOCATED TO NASHVILLE WITH HIS WIFE SUSANNA, A PAINTER AND SONGWRITER. AT THE NEWLY OPENED EXIT/IN, A SMALL LIVE-MUSIC VENUE ON ELLISTON PLACE NEAR VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, CLARK AND OTHERS FOUND A PLACE TO TRY OUT THEIR LATEST SONGS IN FRONT OF A YOUNGER, MORE PROGRESSIVE AUDIENCE. STUART: DOWN ON ELLISTON PLACE, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE PARIS IN THE TWENTIES MUST HAVE BEEN BECAUSE IT WAS ALL BOHEMIANS AND NEW THINKING, FORWARD-THINKING COUNTRY MUSIC PEOPLE. CLARK: THE THING ABOUT NASHVILLE, IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE SQUASHING YOUR CREATIVITY, BUT THEY WILL TO MAKE A BUCK. THE POINT IS THEY'RE IN BUSINESS.

NARRATOR: RODNEY CROWELL HAD GROWN UP IN THE HOUSTON AREA, STEEPED IN COUNTRY MUSIC. HIS PARENTS MET AT A ROY ACUFF CONCERT, AND CROWELL WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HIS FATHER INSISTED ON TAKING HIM TO SEE HANK WILLIAMS PERFORM. BY AGE 11, HE WAS PLAYING IN HIS FATHER'S HONKY-TONK BAND. AT 15, CROWELL HAD HIS OWN GROUP THAT TOURED SMALL TOWNS PROMISING TO PERFORM EVERYTHING FROM THE BEACH BOYS AND THE BEATLES TO RHYTHM AND BLUES AND, THEIR BUSINESS CARD SAID, "COUNTRY, IF YOU WANT IT." HE WAS 22 WHEN HE CAME TO NASHVILLE AND SOON BEGAN SHOWING UP AT THE UNOFFICIAL GATHERING PLACE FOR LIKE-MINDED MUSICIANS-- THE HOME OF GUY AND SUSANNA CLARK. ♪ ALL RIGHT NOW, I'VE JUST HIT MY STRIDE ♪ ♪ RIGHT OFF THE BAT, LORD, I'M DRUNK ON BLUEBIRD WINE ♪ ♪ YES, IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW ♪ ♪ I'VE JUST HIT MY STRIDE ♪ ♪ LORD, IT JUST STARTED, LORD ♪ ♪ AND I'M DRUNK ON BLUEBERRY WINE ♪ CROWELL: WE NEVER CALLED.

THEN, OTHER TIMES, HE AND SUSANNA WOULD CRAWL OUT OF BED AND GET DRESSED, AND STAY UP WITH US TILL DAYLIGHT, JUST TRADING SONGS, TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET IT DONE. ANYBODY WAS WELCOME THAT PLAYED GOOD MUSIC AND WASN'T TOO MUCH OF AN ASS..., AND JUST, YOU KNOW, "COME ON OVER." CROWELL: I REMEMBER GUY CLARK TELLING ME, "YOU'RE A TALENTED GUY." HE SAID, "YOU CAN BE A STAR. "YOU PROBABLY HAVE THE TALENT TO DO IT, "OR YOU CAN BE AN ARTIST. "PICK ONE. THEY'RE BOTH WORTHWHILE PURSUITS." ♪ NARRATOR: THE MOST FREQUENT VISITOR TO THE CLARKS' HOUSE WAS THEIR CLOSE FRIEND, ANOTHER TROUBADOUR FROM TEXAS, THE BRILLIANT AND EQUALLY ECCENTRIC TOWNES VAN ZANDT. VAN ZANDT: ♪ IF I NEEDED YOU ♪ WOULD YOU COME TO ME? WOULD YOU COME... ♪ NARRATOR: HE WAS BORN IN FORT WORTH TO A PROMINENT FAMILY, BUT TOWNES HAD TURNED AWAY FROM HIS FATHER'S AND GRANDFATHER'S PROFESSION AS LAWYERS TO PURSUE A VAGABOND'S LIFE AS A SINGER-SONGWRITER. THE BLUES GUITARIST LIGHTNIN' HOPKINS HAD BEEN THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE ON HIS MUSIC; ANOTHER HERO WAS HANK WILLIAMS, WHOSE TURBULENT AND TRAGICALLY SHORT LIFE VAN ZANDT SEEMED DETERMINED TO FOLLOW. HE DRANK HEAVILY AND CONSTANTLY, WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR MANIC DEPRESSION, BECAME ADDICTED TO HEROIN FOR A WHILE, AND SPENT HIS 29th BIRTHDAY CONVINCED HE WAS GOING TO DIE, JUST AS HANK HAD AT THAT AGE. CLARK: HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A STAR AS SUCH. HE WANTED TO BE A POET. I WAS ALWAYS INSPIRED BY HIM. BUT TO BE INSPIRED BY TOWNES WAS DIFFERENT THAN BEING LIKE HIM. IF YOU WANTED TO BE LIKE TOWNES, YOU HAD TO BE DEAD. NARRATOR: VAN ZANDT SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME ON THE ROAD-- SOMETIMES HITCHHIKING FROM ONE PERFORMANCE TO ANOTHER; LIVING IN RUNDOWN MOTELS OR RENTED SHACKS; WRITING ALL THE TIME, INCLUDING "IF I NEEDED YOU," WRITING ALL THE TIME, INCLUDING "IF I NEEDED YOU," WHICH HE SAID HE COMPOSED IN HIS SLEEP. ♪ IF I NEEDED YOU, WOULD YOU COME TO ME? ♪ ♪ WOULD YOU COME TO ME AND EASE MY PAIN? ♪ ♪ IF YOU NEEDED ME ♪ I WOULD COME TO YOU ♪ ♪ I'D SWIM THE SEAS FOR TO EASE YOUR PAIN ♪ NARRATOR: BUT IT WAS ANOTHER SONG OF HIS THAT WOULD HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON COUNTRY MUSIC AND THE STARTLING ARRAY OF MUSICIANS WHO WOULD FEEL COMPELLED TO PERFORM IT.

VAN ZANDT: ♪ LIVING ON THE ROAD, MY FRIEND ♪ ♪ WAS GONNA KEEP YOU FREE AND CLEAN ♪ CLARK: "PANCHO AND LEFTY" WAS ONE OF THOSE SONGS THAT YOU REALLY CAN'T PICK IT APART, YOU KNOW, AND HAVE IT MAKE SENSE.

VAN ZANDT: ♪ AND NOW HE'S GROWING OLD ♪ NARRATOR: BY 1975, TOWNES VAN ZANDT HAD RECORDED 6 ALBUMS, REVERED BY OTHER SONGWRITERS. NONE OF THEM WAS COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL, BUT HE HAD DEVELOPED A SMALL, CULT-LIKE FOLLOWING. LIKE HIS GOOD FRIEND GUY CLARK, HE PERFORMED MOSTLY AT SMALLER VENUES AROUND THE COUNTRY. SMALLER VENUES AROUND THE COUNTRY. "NASHVILLE," HE TOLD A REPORTER, "IS JUST NOT GEARED FOR MINOR KEYS." CLARK: HIS SONGS WERE DARK. SOMEBODY AT A SHOW ASKED HIM, "MAN, WHY DON'T YOU DO A FUNNY SONG?" HE SAID, "THOSE WERE THE FUNNY SONGS." NARRATOR: GROWING UP IN THE SOUTH TEXAS TOWN OF SABINAL, 90 MILES NORTH OF THE MEXICAN BORDER, YOUNG JOHNNY RODRIGUEZ LOVED MARIACHI MUSIC, BUT ALSO THE SONGS OF JIMMIE RODGERS, HANK WILLIAMS, AND MERLE HAGGARD. I WAS DRAWN TO COUNTRY MUSIC BECAUSE I COULD RELATE MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE SINGING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, AND ALSO, I MEAN, IT WAS JUST LIKE, UH, IT WAS THE MUSIC OF OUR PEOPLE. I THINK IN MEXICAN MUSIC, YOU HAVE STORIES. MEXICAN MUSIC AND COUNTRY MUSIC SAID ALMOST THE SAME THING, JUST IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. NARRATOR: IN THE EARLY 1970s, RODRIGUEZ WAS WORKING AT A TEXAS TOURIST ATTRACTION CALLED ALAMO VILLAGE WHEN THE COUNTRY STAR TOM T. HALL HAPPENED TO HEAR HIM PERFORMING. RODRIGUEZ: ♪ I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU ♪ ♪ I MADE UP MY MIND ♪ I CAN'T STOP... HALL: THEY WERE CALLING HIM JOHNNY ROGERS. AND I SAID, "HOW DID A MEXICAN GUY GET A NAME LIKE JOHNNY ROGERS?" RODRIGUEZ: WELL, MY MANAGER, ONE OF HIS BIG HEROES, ROY ROGERS, HE JUST, UH, SAID, "WELL, LET'S JUST CALL YOU JOHNNY ROGERS. THAT'S A COUNTRY MUSIC NAME." HALL: I SAID, "WELL, IF YOU COME TO NASHVILLE AND PICK WITH ME, "WE'RE GOING TO CALL YOU JOHNNY RODRIGUEZ. "THAT'S A MUCH PRETTIER NAME AND IT'S WHO YOU ARE AND WE'LL DO THAT." NARRATOR: HALL ARRANGED FOR RODRIGUEZ TO COME TO NASHVILLE AND SET UP AN AUDITION WITH A RECORD LABEL. HALL: I SAID, "I'M NOT A TALENT SCOUT," BUT I SAID, "LISTEN TO THIS KID SING THIS SONG." SO, HE STARTED OFF AND HE WAS SINGING "I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU," HALF IN ENGLISH AND HALF IN SPANISH. AND THEY SAID, "WE'LL SIGN HIM UP." [RODRIGUEZ SINGING IN SPANISH] NARRATOR: RODRIGUEZ WOULD HAVE 15 CONSECUTIVE TOP 10 HITS AND BECOME THE FIRST MEXICAN-AMERICAN TO BE A MAJOR COUNTRY MUSIC STAR. RODRIGUEZ: I SAY THIS WITH ALL SINCERITY, I NEVER HAD A CROSS FEELING IN THIS CITY. TO THIS DAY, I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THAT. IT MAKES ME ALMOST WANT TO CRY. I'M SERIOUS. BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE SO NICE THAT IT REALLY STILL TOUCHES ME TILL TODAY. ♪ IN DREAMS OF YESTERDAY [APPLAUSE] NARRATOR: IN 1975, TWO YEARS AFTER RODRIGUEZ WAS NOMINATED FOR THE COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION'S MALE VOCALIST OF THE YEAR AWARD, BALDEMAR HUERTA, THE SON OF A MIGRANT FARM WORKER IN SOUTH TEXAS, PERFORMING AS FREDDY FENDER, CAME OUT WITH HIS OWN HIT SONG, "BEFORE THE NEXT TEARDROP FALLS," WHICH TOPPED BOTH THE POP AND COUNTRY CHARTS.

COLTER: YOU COULD TAKE YOUR MUSICIANS, YOU COULD TAKE YOUR SONGS, YOU COULD HAVE A HAND IN CHOOSING YOUR OWN PRODUCER, AND BASICALLY BE MORE INDEPENDENT IN PUTTING IT TOGETHER SO IT'S TRULY A RESULT OF WHO YOU ARE. HERE, THERE WAS AN OLD GUARD. YOU KNOW? IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A LARGE CONGLOMERATE MAKING REFRIGERATORS, LIKE RCA MAKING TVs. ALL WAYLON WANTED WAS FOR HIS MUSIC THAT HE WAS DOING LIVE, ON THE STAGE, AND DRIVING THE PEOPLE CRAZY, TO SOUND EXACTLY LIKE THAT ON THE RECORD. AND IT DIDN'T. IT DIDN'T. NELSON: WAYLON WAS, YOU KNOW, A REAL ARTIST. HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED AND HE WAS RUNNING INTO THE SAME THINGS THAT A LOT OF US WERE RUNNING IN THERE.

I TOLD THEM THEY BETTER NOT COME UP THERE NO MORE WHEN I WASN'T THERE. BUT THEY CAME BACK. OF COURSE THEY DID. NARRATOR: JENNINGS LET HIS HAIR GROW LONGER AND SHAGGIER, ADDED A BEARD AND MUSTACHE, GAVE UP SHINY SUITS COMPLETELY, IN FAVOR OF BLUE JEANS AND LEATHER VESTS. AND HE STARTED MAKING THE MUSIC HE WANTED TO MAKE. HE INVITED COWBOY JACK CLEMENT, NASHVILLE'S MOST FREE-SPIRITED PRODUCER, TO WORK ON HIS NEXT ALBUM. MUSICIANS KNEW COWBOY JACK LIKED WHAT THEY WERE DOING WHEN THEY SAW HIM DANCING BEHIND THE CONTROL BOARD. JENNINGS: ♪ LOOKS LIKE THE PLACE I CAME IN ♪ COLTER: WHEN YOU'D GET IT TO THE RIGHT PLACE, JACK WOULD DANCE. SO, HE FELT IT FROM THE INSIDE OUT. IT WASN'T ABOUT MARKETING OR...

NARRATOR: JENNINGS BROUGHT HIS BAND INTO HILLBILLY CENTRAL, WHERE HE AND CLEMENT BEGAN RECORDING AN ALBUM CALLED "DREAMING MY DREAMS." IT WAS AN ECLECTIC COLLECTION OF SONGS, PAYING HOMAGE TO COUNTRY MUSIC LEGENDS LIKE JIMMIE RODGERS, BOB WILLS, ROGER MILLER, AND ESPECIALLY HANK WILLIAMS.

NARRATOR: "DREAMING MY DREAMS" BECAME A HUGE HIT. NOW OTHER COUNTRY ARTISTS WERE DEMANDING CONTRACTS LIKE WAYLON'S. AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE SHOWING UP AT HILLBILLY CENTRAL. SMITH: FIRST OF ALL, THE BUILDING DIDN'T HAVE WINDOWS. AND EVERYBODY, UP AND DOWN MUSIC ROW, WANTED TO COME IN THAT BUILDING TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON THERE. WILLIE WOULD COME TO TOWN AND HE WOULD BE THERE. KINKY FRIEDMAN AND THE TEXAS JEW BOYS PRACTICALLY LIVED THERE. THEY'D BE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE HALLS. SHEL SILVERSTEIN HUNG OUT THERE. AND THE GREAT COWBOY JACK CLEMENT. THE HIP PEOPLE OF NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE HUNG OUT AT THAT BUILDING. PEOPLE THOUGHT, "THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING GOING ON AND THEY AIN'T GOT NO WINDOWS."

MUSIC STARTS OUT RAW. AND, AS IT GO, IT GETS MORE POLISHED, MORE POLISHED, MORE POLISHED, AND THE NEXT GENERATION COMES ALONG AND GOES, "WE DON'T LIKE THAT SLICK STUFF." AND IT BECOMES FUNKY AND RAW AGAIN. NARRATOR: BY THE 1970s, WITH COUNTRYPOLITAN RULING THE AIRWAVES, ACOUSTIC STRING BAND MUSIC HAD VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARED FROM COUNTRY RADIO. BUT THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF PEOPLE PLAYING IT. STUART: BLUEGRASS FESTIVALS WERE DOING GREAT. THE ROOTS OF IT WAS GREAT. EVERYBODY THAT MATTERED WAS STILL MAKING PLENTY OF GOOD MUSIC, THEY JUST WEREN'T GETTING RECOGNIZED AS MUCH. NARRATOR: MARTY STUART, STILL A TEENAGER, WAS NOW OFFICIALLY PART OF LESTER FLATT'S BAND, THE NASHVILLE GRASS. ON OCCASIONS, HE ALSO TRAVELED WITH BILL MONROE, THE PATRIARCH OF BLUEGRASS. STUART: A LOT OF MY EARLY MANDOLIN EXPERIENCES WERE JUST RIDING DOWN THE ROAD AFTER SOME OF THOSE SHOWS AT NIGHT AND HIM JUST, US, SITTING THERE IN THE DARKNESS, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT THE TAIL LIGHTS TO THE BUS IN FRONT OF US, PLAYING MUSIC. AND HE KEPT HIS REGULAR MANDOLIN HERE, AND SOMETIMES HE KEPT ONE OVER HERE THAT WAS TUNED IN STRANGE TUNINGS VERY ANCIENT-SOUNDING. HE CALLED THEM THE ANCIENT TONES. AND HE WAS NEVER ONE OF THOSE GUYS TO SAY, "LISTEN TO THIS TUNE." HE WOULD, HE WOULD GO LIKE... [PLAYING MANDOLIN] AND LOOK OFF AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO... [PLAYING MANDOLIN] AND WHEN I WOULD GET IT, HE'D MOVE ON. AND, UH, WHEN I'D MISS IT, HE'D JUST KIND OF, UM, SHAKE HIS HEAD AND RUN OFF AND DO SOMETHING ELSE. AND IT WOULD KILL ME IF I COULDN'T KEEP UP. NARRATOR: OTHER BLUEGRASS MUSICIANS WERE ALSO COMING OF AGE. RICKY SKAGGS WAS FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF EASTERN KENTUCKY. MAN: I'D STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE, AND I'D HEAR MOM AND DAD LISTENING TO FLATT AND SCRUGGS OR RALPH STANLEY, AND THEN I'D, I'D HEAR, YOU KNOW, MY SISTER LISTENING TO THE BEATLES, UH, OVER HERE. AND I WOULD STAND IN THE MIDDLE, AND IT'S LIKE I WOULD HEAR TWO WORLDS GOING OFF AND ON. BUT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, THE HARMONIES THAT JOHN AND PAUL WERE DOING WAS NOT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT RALPH AND CARTER WAS DOING. TO ME, I COULD HEAR IT. NARRATOR: LIKE MARTY STUART, SKAGGS HAD TAKEN UP THE MANDOLIN AT AN EARLY AGE--AND HE WAS GOOD AT IT, TOO. SKAGGS: I WAS 6 YEARS OLD. I HAD ONLY BEEN PLAYING THE MANDOLIN ABOUT A YEAR. AND, UH, BILL MONROE CAME TO MARTHA, KENTUCKY. AND THAT NIGHT CHANGED MY LIFE. SOME NEIGHBORS IN THE HOOD HAD STARTED, UH, SHOUTING OUT TO MR. MONROE, "LET LITTLE RICKY SKAGGS GET UP THERE AND SING ONE." HE WAS NICE AND HE KEPT ON DOING HIS SHOW. SO, FINALLY, AFTER A COUPLE MORE HEE-HAWS FROM THE AUDIENCE, WHY, I THINK HE WAS READY TO PUT A STOP TO IT, SO HE INVITED "LITTLE RICKY SKAGGS" TO COME UP ONSTAGE. I DON'T THINK HE REALLY KNEW HOW LITTLE RICKY SKAGGS WAS AT THE TIME. HE TOOK HIS BIG F-5 SIZED MANDOLIN LIKE THIS AND PUT THE STRAP AROUND THE CURL HERE AND PUT IT ON ME WHEN HE FOUND OUT I PLAYED MANDOLIN. YOU KNOW? AND WE PLAYED A SONG CALLED "RUBY, ARE YOU MAD AT YOUR MAN?" NOW, THAT IS A 6-YEAR-OLD HIT, RIGHT THERE. [LAUGHS] ♪ OH, RUBY, RUBY, HONEY, ARE YOU MAD AT YOUR MAN? ♪ ♪ OH, RUBY ♪ RUBY I NEVER KNEW WHAT SHE WAS MAD ABOUT. [LAUGHS] [BANJO PLAYING] NARRATOR: IN NORMAN, OKLAHOMA, A YOUNG BANJO AND GUITAR PLAYER NAMED VINCE GILL SWITCHED FROM PLAYING ROCK AND ROLL IN HIGH SCHOOL TO JOIN A BLUEGRASS BAND, MOUNTAIN SMOKE. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD CAUGHT THEIR BIG BREAK WHEN THEY WERE ASKED TO FILL IN AT THE LAST MINUTE AS THE OPENING ACT AT A CONCERT IN OKLAHOMA CITY. MAN: WE WENT DOWN TO THE CIVIC CENTER IN OKLAHOMA CITY AND WE WERE GOING TO OPEN FOR KISS, IN OUR LITTLE BLUEGRASS BAND. AND YOU COULDN'T-- YOU COULDN'T SCRIPT-- "SPINAL TAP" COULDN'T SCRIPT THIS, YOU KNOW? THEY HAD THEIR 30-FOOT DRUM RISERS AND STACKS OF AMPLIFIERS TO THE CEILING AND DEATH AND FIRE AND ALL OF THIS STUFF. WE COME OUT THERE WITH OUR LITTLE FIDDLES AND OUR MANDOLINS. [IMITATES FIDDLE] [LAUGHS] THESE PEOPLE FLIPPED COMPLETELY OUT. THEY HATED US SO BAD. THEY STARTED BOOING FROM THE FIRST NOTE AND SCREAMING, AND I MUST SAY, IT WAS KIND OF A NEAT FEELING, HAVING THAT MANY PEOPLE PISSED OFF AT YOU, AND SCREAMING AT YOU, THAT IT WAS LIKE A BIG ROOMFUL OF APPLAUSE IN A WEIRD WAY. WE ONLY LASTED ABOUT 3 SONGS, AND THEN THE BEER BOTTLES STARTED FLYING, AND WE SAID, "WELL, WE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE." SO, I TURNED AROUND AND FLIPPED THEM OFF AND TOLD THEM TO KISS MY ASS. AND THE NEXT DAY, THERE WAS A REVIEW IN THE PAPER AND IT SAID, "GROUP MEMBER VINCE GILL ON HIS DEPARTURE "SHOWED THE CROWD WHICH PART OF HIS ANATOMY THE CROWD COULD KISS," IN THEIR BLOCK LETTERS, THAT WAS THEIR LOGO. [LAUGHS] NARRATOR: MEANWHILE, LESTER FLATT AND THE NASHVILLE GRASS FOUND THEMSELVES PLAYING ON THE SAME STAGE WITH THE JAZZ PIANIST CHICK COREA AND THE FUNK BAND KOOL AND THE GANG. STUART: I REMEMBER PUTTING MY HEAD DOWN ON THE BUNK IN THE BUS, GOING, "THEY'RE GOING TO LAUGH US OFF OF THE STAGE." BUT WE WENT OUT THERE IN THAT TRADITIONAL DRESS, ALL THESE OLD GUYS, AND ME, AS A YOUNGSTER, AND THE MOVIE "DELIVERANCE" WAS PRETTY HOT AT THE TIME. AND, UNKNOWINGLY, LESTER HAD ALWAYS DONE "DUELING BANJOS" AS A PART OF HIS SHOW FOR YEARS. IT WAS ON THE NEW RECORD. SO, IT WAS JUST SIMPLY ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTALS THAT WAS PLAYED THAT NIGHT. [PLAYING "DUELING BANJOS"] [APPLAUSE] WELL, THAT UNLOCKED, AND WE ENCORED. AND AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, WE HAD ENCORED 9 TIMES. AND THE NEXT DAY, LESTER'S MANAGER BOOKED 72 COLLEGE SHOWS AND ROCK SHOWS OFF OF THAT ONE 30-MINUTE PERFORMANCE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, WE GO FROM BEING A TIRED, OLD OPRY BAND THAT'S PLAYING "MOM AND POP" SHOWS AND, YOU KNOW, BLUEGRASS FESTIVALS TO WE WERE ROCK STARS. NARRATOR: ONE OF THEIR FIRST SHOWS WAS AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. THE CONCERT THAT NIGHT FEATURED AN UP-AND-COMING ROCK GROUP, THE EAGLES, AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE BYRDS, GRAM PARSONS, WHO HAD BROUGHT ALONG A NEW HARMONY SINGER, EMMYLOU HARRIS. HARRIS: HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT REAL COUNTRY MUSIC, THE REAL WASHED IN THE BLOOD STUFF. BUT HE WAS ALSO A CHILD OF THE SIXTIES. ROCK AND ROLL WAS ALSO A PASSION OF HIS. HE KIND OF HAD ONE FOOT IN BOTH WORLDS. HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT YOU COULD BRING THE TWO TOGETHER. THE FLYING BURRITO BROTHERS: ♪ SHE'S TELLING DIRTY LIES... NARRATOR: BACK IN 1968, PARSONS HAD COME TO NASHVILLE AND RECORDED THE ALBUM "SWEETHEART OF THE RODEO" WITH THE BYRDS.

THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE CROSSING OF PEOPLE VERY INTERESTED IN THE ROOTS OF COUNTRY MUSIC AND FOLK MUSIC AND ROCK AND ROLL AND HOW IT ALL FIT TOGETHER. NARRATOR: AS A SELF-APPOINTED APOSTLE OF THE FUSION HE CALLED COSMIC AMERICAN MUSIC, PARSONS BECAME FRIENDS WITH THE ROLLING STONES AND HELPED INFLUENCE THE CREATION OF THEIR SONG, "WILD HORSES." PARSONS' NEXT PROSPECT FOR CONVERSION TO COUNTRY MUSIC WAS EMMYLOU HARRIS. EXCEPT FOR JOHNNY CASH, I COULDN'T BE FOOLED WITH COUNTRY MUSIC.

AND TOLD PARSONS ABOUT HER REMARKABLE VOICE. ♪ OOH [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GRAM PARSONS: ♪ LOVE HURTS ♪ LOVE SCARS... NARRATOR: A YEAR LATER, AS PARSONS PREPARED TO RECORD HIS FIRST SOLO ALBUM, HE SENT HARRIS A PLANE TICKET FOR LOS ANGELES, AND THEY BEGAN REHEARSALS, WHICH INCLUDED HIS TUTORIALS ON THE MUSIC HE LOVED, LIKE MELODIES WRITTEN BY FELICE AND BOUDLEAUX BRYANT OR THE TIGHT HARMONIES OF THE INFLUENTIAL GOSPEL AND COUNTRY DUO, THE LOUVIN BROTHERS. PARSONS: ♪ TAKE A LOT OF PAIN... ♪ HARRIS: IT WAS A VERY INTENSE MUSICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. PARSONS: ♪ LOVE HURTS... HARRIS: I HAD NO IDEA WHO THE LOUVIN BROTHERS WERE.

IN AUSTIN, HE DISCOVERED AN EMERGING MUSIC SCENE THAT SEEMED TO HIM MUCH MORE FREEWHEELING THAN THE NASHVILLE HE KNEW, LESS CONCERNED ABOUT LABELING MUSIC AND MORE WELCOMING TO OFFBEAT ARTISTS LIKE HIMSELF.

"THEY'RE ALL SITTING SIDE-BY-SIDE "WATCHING ME PLAY MY SONGS AND SING MY MUSIC. YOU NEED TO COME DOWN HERE AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON."

THEY'RE OUT THERE DRINKING BEER, SMOKING POT, AND FINDING OUT THAT THEY REALLY DIDN'T HATE EACH OTHER. WILLIE'S PICNICS. THE MOST DISORGANIZED GATHERING OF THE TRIBES.

YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE STRINGS AND VOICES AND HORNS, AND SO THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE RECORD BEFORE YOU GET IT OUT, WHICH ALSO MEANS YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET A QUARTER OUT OF IT 'CAUSE IT'S ALL TIED UP IN THE BEGINNING. NARRATOR: NELSON SPENT ONLY $4,000 RECORDING "RED HEADED STRANGER" AND GOT THE SIMPLE, UNVARNISHED SOUND HE WAS LOOKING FOR, HIS SINGULAR VOICE UNTOUCHED BY ANY ENGINEERING TRICKS, AND THE SPAREST BACK-UP INSTRUMENTATION, INCLUDING HIS OWN IDIOSYNCRATIC GUITAR PLAYING.

"THE KIDS IN THE CROWD THOUGHT 'STARDUST' WAS A NEW SONG I HAD WRITTEN," HE EXPLAINED. "THE OLDER FOLKS REMEMBERED THE SONG WELL AND LOVED IT AS MUCH AS I DID."

AT A PROMOTION IN NASHVILLE, AUDREY BROUGHT THE CAR ITSELF. HOLLY WILLIAMS: MY DAD WAS DEALING WITH HIS DAD'S SHADOW FROM DAY ONE, NOT ONLY FROM FANS AND FRIENDS, BUT FROM HIS OWN MOM. SHE WAS RIGHT THERE WITH OTHER PEOPLE GOING, "YOU NEED TO SING YOUR DADDY'S SONGS." YOU KNOW, "YOU NEED TO WRITE LIKE YOUR DADDY DID." IT WAS VERY HARD FOR HIM.

AS SOON AS HE TURNED 18 AND BECAME ENTITLED TO HIS INHERITANCE AND LEGALLY ABLE TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS, WILLIAMS DROPPED HIS MOTHER AS HIS MANAGER AND SET OUT TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY IN THE MUSIC WORLD. WILLIAMS JR.: I SAID, "I'M DONE WITH THIS. I'M DOING MY OWN..." BECAUSE THERE'S ONE SIMPLE REASON. DADDY DON'T NEED ME TO PROMOTE HIM. HOW DUMB CAN YOU BE? HE DOES NOT NEED ME TO PROMOTE HIM. WHAT A JOKE. THAT'S A JOKE. YEAH. I SAID, "I THINK I BETTER START WRITING MY OWN AND DOING MY OWN STYLE OF STUFF." HOLLY WILLIAMS: HE TOLD ME HIS FIRST FEW SHOWS OF HIS OWN MUSIC, YOU KNOW, HE WOULD, LITERALLY, HE'S GETTING BOOS FROM THE CROWD. HE SAID 50% OF THEM, SOMETIMES 80% WOULD BE GONE. THERE'D BE A FEW PEOPLE LEFT SITTING THERE. THEY'D THROW STUFF AT HIM. HE'D SAY, "IF Y'ALL DON'T MIND, I'M GOING TO SING A SONG OF MINE FOR YOU TONIGHT." AND JUST GONE. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, WHICH JUST ON A BASIC, YOU KNOW, HUMAN BEING NICE TO PEOPLE LEVEL IS SO SHOCKING TO ME THAT PEOPLE WOULD JUST TURN AWAY AND WALK OUT. BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT. THEY WANTED TO HEAR "COLD, COLD HEART" AND "I SAW THE LIGHT," AND SO, HE REALLY, REALLY STRUGGLED FOR YEARS. NARRATOR: BY 1974, HE HAD ENTERED WHAT HE CALLED "AN ENDLESS NIGHTMARE OF BARS AND SHOWS, OF JIM BEAM AND MULTI-COLORED PILLS." "I'D NEVER REALIZED HOW DEEPLY INGRAINED MY DADDY'S MYTH REALLY WAS," HE RECALLED. "AT 25 YEARS OLD, I WAS MORE LIKE HIM "THAN I EVER FIGURED I'D BE-- DRUNK, ON DOPE, DIVORCED."

HE WAS ATTRACTED TO WHAT WAS CALLED SOUTHERN ROCK, MUSIC BY GROUPS LIKE THE ALLMAN BROTHERS, LYNYRD SKYNYRD, THE MARSHALL TUCKER BAND, AND HIS FRIEND CHARLIE DANIELS. DANIELS: WE WERE COUNTRY, BUT NOT WHAT WAS ACCEPTED BY THE COUNTRY MUSIC ESTABLISHMENT AT THE TIME, LET'S SAY. EVERY OTHER MUSIC WAS CHANGING AND MOVING AND COOKING.

BY SOME MIRACLE, HE SURVIVED, THOUGH EVERY BONE IN HIS FACE HAD BEEN BROKEN, ONE EYE WAS PERMANENTLY DAMAGED, HIS NOSE WAS TORN OFF, AND PARTS OF HIS BRAIN WERE EXPOSED THROUGH A DEEP GASH IN HIS FOREHEAD. 3 SURGEONS WORKED 7 1/2 HOURS TRYING TO PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER.

ROSANNE CASH: GOT IN THIS BIG FIGHT WITH RODNEY OUTSIDE A FRENCH RESTAURANT ON VENTURA BOULEVARD, AND I STARTED WRITING WHAT WAS A LONG POEM, AND I DISTILLED IT DOWN TO "SEVEN YEAR ACHE." AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS A COUNTRY SONG. I DIDN'T KNOW IF I HAD ACHIEVED WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO. CROWELL: WHEN I FIRST HEARD ROSANNE'S SONG "SEVEN YEAR ACHE," WELL, I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH IT 'CAUSE SHE WROTE IT BECAUSE I WAS BEING AN IDIOT, AND SHE WAS REALLY WRITING ABOUT ME, AND I THOUGHT, "OH, GREAT. THIS IS A GREAT SONG AND IT'S ABOUT ME." ♪ YOU ACT LIKE YOU WERE JUST BORN TONIGHT ♪ ♪ FACE DOWN IN A MEMORY BUT FEELING ALL RIGHT ♪ ♪ SO WHO DOES YOUR PAST BELONG TO TODAY? ♪ ♪ BABY, YOU DON'T SAY NOTHING WHEN YOU'RE FEELING THIS WAY ♪ ♪ THE GIRLS IN THE BAR THINKING, "WHO IS THIS GUY?" ♪ ♪ BUT THEY DON'T THINK NOTHING WHEN THEY'RE TELLING YOU LIES ♪ ♪ YOU LOOK SO CARELESS... NARRATOR: THE ALBUM WOULD BECOME A GOLD RECORD AND BE NOMINATED FOR A GRAMMY. ♪ ...WHEN THEIR POCKETS ARE FULL ♪ ♪ JUST TELL THEM YOU'RE TRYING TO CURE A 7-YEAR ACHE... ♪ NARRATOR: ROSANNE CASH WAS 25 YEARS OLD. ♪ BOYS SAY, "WHEN IS HE GONNA GIVE US SOME ROOM?" ♪ ♪ GIRLS SAY, "GOD, I HOPE HE COMES BACK SOON"... ♪ GILL: I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT SINGS, AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR HER. SO IN A SENSE, I PROBABLY HAVE SOME GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF HOW HARD IT WAS FOR ROSANNE TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. BUT THE COOL THING WAS THAT SHE WAS NOTHING LIKE HER DAD. THE MUSIC WAS NOTHING LIKE HER FATHER'S. SHE CAME FROM A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PLACE, AND SHE WAS HER OWN ARTIST FROM DAY ONE. NARRATOR: BY THIS TIME, JOHNNY CASH HAD MADE AN ADDITION TO HIS MUSICAL FAMILY. LESTER FLATT HAD DIED, AND MARTY STUART JOINED CASH'S BAND. IT'S INTERESTING. THE FIRST TWO RECORDS I EVER OWNED IN MY LIFE WAS A JOHNNY CASH RECORD AND A LESTER FLATT AND EARL SCRUGGS RECORD. AND THE ONLY TWO JOBS I'VE EVER HAD WAS WITH LESTER FLATT AND JOHNNY CASH. SO THAT WORKED OUT. PARTON: ♪ HERE YOU COME AGAIN ♪ JUST WHEN I'VE BEGUN TO GET MYSELF TOGETHER ♪ ♪ YOU WALTZ RIGHT IN THE DOOR ♪ ♪ JUST LIKE YOU'VE DONE BEFORE ♪ ♪ AND WRAP MY HEART ROUND YOUR LITTLE FINGER ♪ ♪ HERE YOU COME AGAIN... WOMAN: SHE'S CROSSED ALL BOUNDARIES. DOLLY'S NOT COUNTRY, DOLLY'S NOT ROCK, DOLLY'S NOT POP, DOLLY'S EVERYTHING. AND EVERYBODY FROM EVERY GENRE LOVES HER. PARTON: ♪ ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SMILE THAT SMILE ♪ ♪ AND THERE GO ALL MY DEFENSES... ♪ LEE: SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE JUST NASHVILLE. NASHVILLE WAS GREAT TO HER AND SHE REVERES IT, BUT DOLLY WANTED TO BE EVERYWHERE. AND THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] PARTON: ♪ LOOKING BETTER THAN A BODY HAS A RIGHT TO ♪ ♪ AND SHAKING ME UP SO... NARRATOR: FRUSTRATED WITH THE TRAJECTORY OF HER SOLO CAREER, DOLLY PARTON HIRED A NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM IN LOS ANGELES, AND TRAVELED THERE TO RECORD A NEW ALBUM. "I'M NOT LEAVING COUNTRY MUSIC," SHE TOLD REPORTERS, "I'M TAKING IT WITH ME." PARTON: ♪ ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SMILE THAT SMILE... ♪ PARTON: I WAS TRYING TO EXPAND MY HORIZONS. I WANTED MORE. I JUST FELT LIKE I COULD HAVE A BROADER AUDIENCE. BUT WHEN I FIRST GOT L.A. MANAGEMENT, EVERYBODY SAID I WAS MAKING A MISTAKE LEAVING PORTER'S SHOW. PORTER TOLD ME THAT AS WELL. EVERYBODY WAS SAYING I WAS BETRAYING COUNTRY. HOW COULD I NOT BE COUNTRY? I'M A COUNTRY GIRL AT HEART, IN MY VOICE, IN MY FEELINGS, IN MY ATTITUDE. NARRATOR: PARTON'S NUMBER-ONE COUNTRY SINGLES HAD SOLD ABOUT 60,000 COPIES. "HERE YOU COME AGAIN," HER FIRST CROSSOVER SUCCESS, SOLD A MILLION. THEN THE ALBUM IT CAME FROM DID THE SAME AND WENT PLATINUM. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE WANTED TO LEARN ABOUT THE PETITE AND SHAPELY BLONDE WITH THE BIG HAIR. WITH HER REFRESHING SENSE OF HUMOR, ESPECIALLY ABOUT HERSELF, DOLLY NEVER DISAPPOINTED THEM. "IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY," SHE SAID, "TO LOOK THIS CHEAP." IN NEW YORK, SHE GAVE A FREE CONCERT AT CITY HALL PLAZA, AND MAYOR ED KOCH PRESENTED HER WITH THE KEYS TO THE CITY. LATER, SHE WAS THE GUEST OF HONOR AT A PARTY AT THE FAMOUS STUDIO 54. "ALTHOUGH I LOOK LIKE A DRAG QUEEN'S CHRISTMAS TREE ON THE OUTSIDE," PARTON SAID, "I AM AT HEART A SIMPLE COUNTRY GIRL." PARTON: THIS IS A COUNTRY GIRL'S IDEA OF GLAMOUR. I WANTED TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES. I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, TO WEAR MAKEUP. I'D PATTERN MY LOOK AFTER THE TOWN TROLLOP IN OUR HOMETOWN 'CAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL. NARRATOR: PARTON WAS ALSO ONE OF THE SAVVIEST ARTISTS IN THE BUSINESS. SHE HAD HER OWN PUBLISHING COMPANY, MARKETED A SUCCESSFUL LINE OF DOLLY DOLLS, AND NEGOTIATED A 3-YEAR DEAL WITH A LAS VEGAS HOTEL SAID TO BE WORTH FROM $6 MILLION TO $9 MILLION. PARTON: I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM BEING A WOMAN. THAT'S WORKED FOR ME MORE THAN IT'S WORKED AGAINST ME. I JUST ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT I WAS STRONG IN MYSELF AND STRONG IN MY WORK. I DO KNOW, AND I HAVE SEEN, THAT IT CAN BE A HINDRANCE, BUT I WOULD ALWAYS JUST GO IN JUST SAYING, "I THINK I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO OFFER, AND I THINK WE CAN BOTH MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM IT." AND USUALLY, BY THE TIME THE DEAL WAS DONE, I'D HAVE THE MONEY AND GONE. HOLLY WILLIAMS: SHE'S MY IDOL IN MANY WAYS, BUT THE FACT THAT SHE IS SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE SONGWRITER AT THE CORE OF ALL THAT SUPERSTARDOM AND, YOU KNOW, FANCY SHOW STUFF, APPEARANCE, IS PROBABLY THE MOST AMAZING THING ABOUT HER TO ME. NARRATOR: IN 1980, SHE ACHIEVED AN ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL OF NATIONAL STARDOM WHEN SHE JOINED JANE FONDA AND LILY TOMLIN IN THE HIT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE "9 TO 5." LET'S JUST SIT DOWN AND-- LOOK, I'VE GOT A GUN OUT THERE IN MY PURSE. AND UP TILL NOW, I'VE BEEN FORGIVING AND FORGETTING BECAUSE OF THE WAY I WAS BROUGHT UP, BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, IF YOU EVER SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT ME OR MAKE ANOTHER INDECENT PROPOSAL, I'M GONNA GET THAT GUN OF MINE, AND I'M GONNA CHANGE YOU FROM A ROOSTER TO A HEN WITH ONE SHOT. DON'T THINK I CAN'T DO IT. PARTON: ♪ IT'S ALL TAKING AND NO GIVING ♪ ♪ WE'RE JUST... NARRATOR: THANKS TO HER SONGWRITING TALENT, HER UNMISTAKABLE VOICE, HER BIGGER-THAN-LIFE PERSONA, AND HER TIRELESS DRIVE, DOLLY PARTON HAD BECOME THE MOST FAMOUS WOMAN IN COUNTRY MUSIC. "I'M NOT OFFENDED BY ALL THE DUMB BLONDE JOKES BECAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT DUMB," SHE SAID. "AND I'M NOT BLONDE, EITHER." PARTON: ♪ PUTTING MONEY IN HIS WALLET ♪ ♪ 9 TO 5, WHOA, WHAT A WAY TO MAKE A LIVIN' ♪ NARRATOR: COUNTRY MUSIC'S EMBRACE WAS NOW BIGGER THAN EVER. ARTISTS WERE EXPLODING THE OLD DEFINITIONS AND EXPLORING EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF STYLES, AND MANY OF THEM DIDN'T CARE WHAT IT WAS CALLED. ALABAMA: ♪ LIKE GRANDMA AND GRANDPA USED TO PLAY... ♪ NARRATOR: ALABAMA, A COUNTRY BAND FORMED BY 3 COUSINS, EMERGED FROM PLAYING FOR TIPS IN ROWDY DANCE HALLS TO FILLING BIG ARENAS AND THRILLING THEIR LEGIONS OF FANS WITH THEIR ROCK-STYLE PRODUCTIONS. RONNIE MILSAP, A BLIND SINGER FROM NORTH CAROLINA, MIXED COUNTRY AND ROCK, BLUES AND SOUL AND HAD DOZENS OF NUMBER-ONE HITS. THE OAK RIDGE BOYS HAD BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS TO EXPAND THEIR FAN BASE FROM THE TINY GOSPEL MARKET. WITH SONGS LIKE "ELVIRA," THEY BECAME ONE OF THE TOP-SELLING GROUPS IN COUNTRY MUSIC. BARBARA MANDRELL HAD MASTERED THE STEEL GUITAR BY THE TIME SHE WAS 11 YEARS OLD. BY 13, SHE TOURED WITH JOHNNY CASH AND BACKED UP GEORGE JONES. NOW SHE RELEASED ALBUMS THAT R&B; STATIONS PLAYED AND STARRED IN HER OWN NETWORK VARIETY SHOW. KENNY ROGERS HAD PLAYED FOLK AND ROCK MUSIC AND SANG COUNTRY-POP BALLADS LIKE "THE GAMBLER," A SONG SO POPULAR 4 MADE-FOR-TELEVISION MOVIES WERE BASED ON IT. BETWEEN 1973 AND 1983, THE NUMBER OF FULL-TIME COUNTRY RADIO STATIONS WOULD NEARLY TRIPLE, RISING FROM 764 TO 2,266. GOLD ALBUMS, ONCE A RARITY, WERE NOW BEING ANNOUNCED NEARLY TWICE A MONTH. JONES: ♪ THERE ARE THOSE WHO'D LIKE TO CHANGE ♪ ♪ THE WAY I'M LIVING... HARRIS: I THINK I WAS SWEEPING THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING, AND I HAD A GEORGE JONES RECORD ON, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD HIM. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT. BUT IT WAS LIKE A VEIL LIFTED FROM MY EARS, ATTACHED TO MY SOUL AND MY HEART AND THE WAY I LISTENED TO MUSIC. I HEARD HIM, TRULY HEARD HIM, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE SOULFULNESS IN HIS VOICE. AND IT WAS JUST THIS INCREDIBLE "AHA" MOMENT WHERE I THOUGHT, "THERE'S JUST NO ONE LIKE HIM." JONES: ♪ I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN ♪ ♪ TO MAKE YOU HAPPY... SHERRILL: I DON'T THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND GEORGE JONES. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A WAY, A WAY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH TO UNDERSTAND GEORGE JONES. I... I QUIT TRYING A LONG TIME AGO. JONES: ♪ ...ARMS MAY ACHE AND WANT TO HOLD YOU... ♪ NARRATOR: IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING HIS DIVORCE FROM TAMMY WYNETTE, GEORGE JONES' LIFE SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL. JONES: ♪ ...DON'T GIVE A DAMN ♪ NARRATOR: ALREADY PRONE TO VIOLENT BOUTS OF HEAVY DRINKING, HE NOW BECAME ADDICTED TO COCAINE. HE CONTINUED TO RECORD, AND NO ONE DISPUTED THE SINGULAR POWER OF HIS VOICE. BUT JONES SEEMED INTENT ON SELF-DESTRUCTION. HE BEGAN MISSING CONCERTS, SO MANY THAT PROMOTERS AND FANS ALIKE GAVE HIM A NEW NICKNAME. IT HAD BEEN "POSSUM." NOW IT WAS "NO SHOW JONES." THE MIXTURE OF WHISKEY AND COCAINE MADE HIM CHRONICALLY SLEEPLESS AND PARANOID. HE LOST WEIGHT, DROPPING TO UNDER 100 POUNDS. HE HAD REPEATED RUN-INS WITH THE POLICE FOR SPEEDING AROUND IN ONE OF HIS CADILLACS WHILE DRUNK. JONES: ♪ ...I MIGHT WAKE... NARRATOR: ENTANGLED IN LAWSUITS FOR BAD DEBTS AND CANCELLED SHOWS, HE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, LOST HIS HOUSE, AND LIVED IN HIS CAR FOR A WHILE. JONES: ♪ I JUST DON'T GIVE A DAMN ♪ NARRATOR: TAMMY WYNETTE'S LIFE WAS IN SHAMBLES, TOO. NOW MARRIED TO HER FIFTH HUSBAND AND PLAGUED BY HEALTH PROBLEMS, SHE HAD BECOME HOOKED ON PRESCRIPTION PAINKILLERS, AND THEN INVOLVED IN A STRING OF BIZARRE INCIDENTS, INCLUDING A SENSATIONAL CLAIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED AND BEATEN UP BEFORE BEING RELEASED WYNETTE HADN'T HAD A NUMBER-ONE HIT FOR 4 YEARS, AND NEITHER HAD GEORGE JONES, WHEN BILLY SHERRILL BROUGHT THE TWO OF THEM BACK INTO THE STUDIO IN JANUARY 1980 FOR ANOTHER ALBUM OF DUETS, "TOGETHER AGAIN." JONES: ♪ WE ALWAYS WANTED A BIG TWO-STORY HOUSE... ♪ SHERRILL: IT WAS KIND OF LIKE TWO WOUNDED ANIMALS. NOT TOO WOUNDED TO KEEP DOING WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND WHAT THEY LOVED DOING. NARRATOR: A SINGLE FROM THE ALBUM, "TWO STORY HOUSE," WHICH WYNETTE HAD CO-WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE OCCASION, WOULD RISE TO NUMBER TWO ON THE COUNTRY CHARTS IN THE SPRING OF 1980. BUT ITS SUCCESS PALED COMPARED TO A SONG JONES RECORDED BY HIMSELF LESS THAN A MONTH LATER. THE EPITOME OF A COUNTRY SONG? PROBABLY "HE STOPPED LOVING HER TODAY." IT'S JUST A LOVE STORY. IT'S SAD. IT'S A WONDERFUL MELODY. IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST WELL-WRITTEN SONGS EVER. NARRATOR: "HE STOPPED LOVING HER TODAY" WAS WRITTEN BY BOBBY BRADDOCK AND CURLY PUTMAN. IT DESCRIBES A MAN WHO WAITS ALL HIS LIFE, PINING AWAY FOR THE WOMAN WHO'S LEFT HIM. MIDWAY THROUGH THE SONG, IT'S REVEALED THAT THE ONLY REASON HE STOPPED LOVING HER IS BECAUSE HE HAS DIED. BILLY SHERRILL BELIEVED THE SONG WAS A PERFECT FIT FOR GEORGE JONES. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS JONES KEPT CONFUSING THE MELODY WITH KRIS KRISTOFFERSON'S "HELP ME MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT." SHERRILL: HE WAS GOING, ♪ HE SAID I'LL LOVE YOU TILL I DIE ♪ I SAID, "THAT'S 'HELP ME MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT,' FOOL." FINALLY, HE SAID... HE GOT MAD AND SAID, ♪ "HE SAID, 'I'LL LOVE YOU TILL I DIE' ♪ IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH?" I SAID, "THAT'S FINE." JONES: ♪ HE SAID, "I'LL LOVE YOU TILL I DIE" ♪ ♪ SHE TOLD HIM, "YOU'LL FORGET IN TIME" ♪ ♪ AS THE YEARS WENT SLOWLY BY ♪ ♪ SHE STILL PREYED UPON HIS MIND ♪ ♪ HE KEPT HER PICTURE ON HIS WALL ♪ ♪ WENT HALF CRAZY NOW AND THEN ♪ ♪ HE STILL LOVED HER THROUGH IT ALL ♪ ♪ HOPING SHE'D COME BACK AGAIN... ♪ NARRATOR: WITH SOME OF NASHVILLE'S BEST SESSION MUSICIANS, SHERRILL CREATED AN ARRANGEMENT THAT HAD A CLASSIC COUNTRYPOLITAN SOUND-- A FAINT, WEEPING STEEL GUITAR WITHOUT A HINT OF TWANG, SWEET BACKGROUND VOCALS, AND AN ENSEMBLE OF STRINGS THAT BUILT STEADILY TOWARD THE SONG'S CLIMAX. BRADDOCK: THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE COMING FROM THE SONGWRITER, BUT I THINK THAT ROOM FULL OF CELLOS AND VIOLAS AND VIOLINS ASCENDING ON THAT RECORD, SOUNDING LIKE THE MAN'S SOUL GOING UP TO HEAVEN, I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL THING ON THE RECORD. SHERRILL: WORD FOR WORD, AFTER I PLAYED HIM THE FINISHED PRODUCT, SO HELP ME GOD, JONES SAID, "YOU'VE GOT YOUR RECORD, BUT LISTEN, SON, NOBODY WILL EVER BUY THAT MORBID SON OF A BITCH." JONES: ♪ HE STOPPED LOVING HER TODAY ♪ ♪ THEY PLACED A WREATH UPON HIS DOOR... ♪ I AM CONVINCED GEORGE JONES MIGHT BE THE MOST SOULFUL SINGER THE PLANET HAS EVER KNOWN. JONES: ♪ ...HIM AWAY ♪ HE STOPPED LOVING HER TODAY... ♪ NARRATOR: 3 MONTHS AFTER ITS RELEASE, "HE STOPPED LOVING HER TODAY" REACHED THE TOP OF THE COUNTRY CHARTS, GEORGE JONES' FIRST SOLO NUMBER-ONE HIT IN 6 YEARS. IT WOULD GO ON TO SELL A MILLION RECORDS AND WIN EVERY POSSIBLE AWARD FOR THE SONGWRITERS AND THE ARTIST. IT'S ONE OF THOSE SONGS THAT WAS MEANT TO BE. AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SONGS THAT GEORGE JONES WAS MEANT TO RECORD. AND WHEN HE GOT DONE WITH IT, IT HAD BEEN DONE. JONES: ♪ ...HER TODAY... SMITH: THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT, I WAS DRIVING OUT 65. I HAD TO PULL OFF THE ROAD. I COULDN'T SEE I WAS CRYING SO HARD. THAT SONG JUST REALLY TOUCHED ME, AND I HONESTLY THINK IT MAY HAVE HAPPENED. [LAUGHS] JONES: ♪ HE STOPPED LOVING HER TODAY ♪ EMERY: I ASKED MERLE ONE TIME WHO HIS FAVORITE COUNTRY SINGER WAS. HE SAID, "GEORGE JONES." I ASKED GEORGE WHO HIS FAVORITE COUNTRY SINGER WAS, HE SAID, "MERLE HAGGARD." [LAUGHS] NARRATOR: BY THE EARLY 1980s, MERLE HAGGARD, ALREADY CONSIDERED ONE OF COUNTRY MUSIC'S GREATEST SINGER-SONGWRITERS, HAD RECORDED MORE THAN 40 ALBUMS AND HAD MORE THAN 30 NUMBER-ONE SINGLES. IN 1983, HE BEGAN WORK ON AN ALBUM WITH WILLIE NELSON. THEY HAD BEEN RECORDING FOR 5 DAYS AT NELSON'S STUDIO IN TEXAS, BUT STILL HADN'T FOUND THE RIGHT SONG TO ANCHOR THE ALBUM. HAGGARD HAD GONE TO SLEEP ON HIS BUS. MEANWHILE, WILLIE'S DAUGHTER PLAYED HER FATHER A TUNE HE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE. IT WAS ON AN EMMYLOU HARRIS ALBUM, A BALLAD WRITTEN BY TOWNES VAN ZANDT. AND WILLIE CAME AND KNOCKED ON MY BUS LATE ONE NIGHT, ABOUT 4:00 IN THE MORNING, ACTUALLY, AND I HAD JUST LAID DOWN. AND HE SAID, "I THINK I'VE FOUND A TITLE FOR OUR ALBUM." AND HE HAD A PAPER SACK ROLLED OUT AND THESE WORDS WERE THAT LONG. AND, LIKE I SAID, I HAD JUST GOT TO BED AND I SAID, "WILLIE," I SAID, "I CAN'T EVEN SEE THOSE LYRICS." I SAID, "YOU GUYS GO AHEAD AND PUT IT DOWN, AND I'LL PUT MY VOICE ON IN THE MORNING." "NO," HE SAID. "GET UP AND COME IN THERE WITH ME." AND SAID, "LET'S DO IT ALL AT ONCE." SO I WENT IN THERE. I WAS REAL SLEEPY, AND WE RECORDED THAT THING. AND I WAS THINKING WHILE I WAS DOING IT, "WELL, I'LL DO THIS OVER IN THE MORNING," YOU KNOW? SO I GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING AND WENT IN THE STUDIO, AND I SAID, "CAN I DO THAT VOCAL TRACK OVER?" AND THEY SAID, "HELL, IT'S ON THE WAY TO NEW YORK." NELSON: ♪ LIVING ON THE ROAD, MY FRIEND ♪ ♪ WAS GONNA KEEP YOU FREE AND CLEAN... ♪ NARRATOR: THE SONG WAS "PANCHO AND LEFTY." THE ALBUM WOULD SHOOT TO NUMBER ONE ON THE COUNTRY CHARTS, CROSS OVER TO POP, AND SELL MORE THAN A MILLION RECORDS. NELSON: ♪ ...HER FAVORITE ONE IT SEEMS... ♪ NARRATOR: TO GET THERE, THE SONG HAD TRAVELED A LONG, MEANDERING ROAD. TWO OF COUNTRY MUSIC'S LEGENDARY SONGWRITERS, THE MUSICAL OUTLAW FROM TEXAS AND THE POET OF THE COMMON MAN FROM THE HARDSCRABBLE STREETS OF BAKERSFIELD, HAD LISTENED TO AN ALBUM RECORDED BY A FORMER HIPPIE FOLK SINGER WHO HAD BEEN CONVERTED TO COUNTRY MUSIC BY A COSMIC COWBOY AND IN DOING SO STUMBLED UPON A SONG WRITTEN BY AN ECCENTRIC VAGABOND WHO SPENT HIS DAYS TRYING TO WRITE THE PERFECT SONG AND SOME OF HIS NIGHTS CRASHING WITH FRIENDS AT A HOME WHERE THE FOCUS WAS ON ART, NOT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. AND ON HIS 60th BIRTHDAY, WILLIE NELSON WOULD SING "PANCHO AND LEFTY" AGAIN, THIS TIME WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO ALSO DEFIED MUSICAL CATEGORIES--BOB DYLAN. NELSON: ♪ OUT OF KINDNESS, I SUPPOSE... ♪ NARRATOR: BACKING THEM UP ON THE MANDOLIN WAS THE KID FROM PHILADELPHIA, MISSISSIPPI WHO HAD PLAYED IN LESTER FLATT'S AND JOHNNY CASH'S BAND-- MARTY STUART.
