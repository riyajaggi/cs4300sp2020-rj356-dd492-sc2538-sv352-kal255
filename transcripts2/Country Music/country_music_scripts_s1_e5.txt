 TO COME TO THE GRAND OLE OPRY. PEOPLE THAT CAME, YOU COULD TELL, THEY WERE WORKING PEOPLE. THE LINES WOULD GO DOWN FIFTH AVENUE AND AROUND DOWN BROADWAY AND--AND LITERALLY, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD BE IN LINE TO GET A LIMITED NUMBER OF TICKETS. NITTY GRITTY DIRT BAND: ♪ ...ERNEST TUBB'S NUMBER ♪ "TWO WRONGS WON'T MAKE A RIGHT" ♪ ♪ AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY EV'RY SATURDAY NIGHT ♪ ♪ MARTY STUART: ALL OF ITS CHILDREN HAD COME TO THE MOTHER CHURCH OF COUNTRY MUSIC. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR, THAT YOU HAD TO, UH, BRING YOUR CULTURE WITH YOU TO THE TABLE. THAT'S WHY BOB WILLS AND HIS GUYS BROUGHT US WESTERN MUSIC; THAT'S WHY HANK WILLIAMS BROUGHT THE SOUTH WITH HIM, FROM HONKY-TONKS. JOHNNY CASH BROUGHT THE BLACK LAND DIRT OF ARKANSAS. BILL MONROE BROUGHT MUSIC OUT OF KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS MUSIC. WILLIE NELSON BROUGHT HIS POETRY FROM TEXAS. PATSY CLINE BROUGHT HER HEARTACHE FROM VIRGINIA. I MEAN, IT--IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL PARADE OF SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF AMERICA THAT BROUGHT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR SOULS AND THEIR EXPERIENCES, AND IT GAVE US A GREAT ERA IN COUNTRY MUSIC.

AND WE... ♪ NARRATOR: DURING THE MID-1960s, THE UNITED STATES FOUND ITSELF IN THE MIDST OF PROFOUND CULTURAL CHANGE AND STUBBORN RESISTANCE TO IT; TORN BETWEEN PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND SENSELESS VIOLENCE; HOPEFUL IDEALISM AND ANGRY DESPAIR. SHEPARD: ♪ ...WHEN TWO WORLDS COLLIDE ♪ YOUR WORLD... NARRATOR: ALL OF IT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN COUNTRY MUSIC. SHEPARD: ♪ ...THINGS SWEET AND GOOD... ♪ NARRATOR: A YOUNG MOTHER FROM THE HOLLERS OF KENTUCKY WOULD STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN WITH UNCOMMON BLUNTNESS AND PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHER WOMEN ARTISTS TO DO THE SAME. A MISSISSIPPI SHARECROPPER'S SON WITH BIG DREAMS WOULD FULFILL THEM, WHEN PEOPLE RESPONDED TO THE QUALITY OF HIS VOICE INSTEAD OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN. TWO DESCENDANTS OF THE DEPRESSION AND THE DUST BOWL WOULD TURN BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA, INTO A MUSICAL MECCA OF ITS OWN. AND A DARK-EYED, DEEP-VOICED TROUBADOUR FROM DYESS, ARKANSAS, WOULD SOMEHOW EMBODY NEARLY EVERYTHING THE SIXTIES CAME TO STAND FOR: HEEDLESS SELF-DESTRUCTION AND A CONCERN FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE; AN EAGERNESS TO EXPERIMENT WITH NEW IDEAS, AND A YEARNING FOR OLD-FASHIONED PERSONAL REDEMPTION. SHEPARD: ♪ ...WHEN TWO WORLDS COLLIDE ♪ I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE, MAN, I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE, MAN... ♪ BILL ANDERSON: COUNTRY RECORDS, IN THOSE DAYS, DID NOT SELL ENOUGH COPIES FOR THE ARTIST TO REALLY MAKE A LIVING JUST OFF OF THEIR RECORDS.

HAZEL & ALICE: ♪ I'LL BE GONE... SMITH: SO IT--IT WAS ALL A BIG FAMILY. ANDERSON: I REMEMBER, AT SUNSET PARK IN WEST GROVE, PENNSYLVANIA, WE WOULD DO 3 SHOWS ON A SUNDAY. AND A WEEK BEFORE, I'D GET A LETTER FROM SOMEBODY, "WELL, NOW, WE'RE BRINGING HAM AND POTATO SALAD AND"-- HA HA HA!-- "CHOCOLATE PIE AND ICED TEA. "NOW WE EXPECT YOU BOYS TO COME OVER AND EAT WITH US NOW BEFORE THE SHOW, BETWEEN THE SHOWS." YOU COULD GAIN A LOT OF WEIGHT PLAYING THOSE PARKS. HA HA HA! STUART: THE INDUSTRY WAS TRULY BUILT ONE HANDSHAKE AT A TIME, ONE AUTOGRAPH AT A TIME. ERNEST TUBB WAS ONE OF THOSE LEGENDARY EXAMPLES. HE WOULD SIT ON THE EDGE OF A STAGE IN A FOLDING CHAIR AND SIGN POPCORN BOXES TILL THE VERY LAST SOUL WAS GONE. THE WORD WAS, "THOSE PEOPLE PUT US UP HERE." ["FOGGY MOUNTAIN ROCK" BY FLATT & SCRUGGS PLAYING] ROY CLARK: ONCE THEY ACCEPT YOU AS PART OF THEIR FAMILY, THEY'RE THERE FOR LIFE. YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANOTHER HIT RECORD, BUT YOU ALREADY MADE ENOUGH THAT THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND THEY LIKE YOU. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY GOING UP TO, UH, FRANK SINATRA AND PATTING HIM ON THE BACK AND SAY, "HOW YOU DOIN', FRANK?" I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT. SMITH: I HAD A WOMAN UP IN WISCONSIN, SHE CAME TO A FESTIVAL I WAS SINGING AT, AND SHE LEANED OVER THE AUTOGRAPH TABLE AND SHE SAID, "I LOVE YOUR MUSIC. I LISTEN TO IT EVERY DAY ON MY VICTROLA." AND THAT JUST MEANT THE WORLD TO ME. I MEAN, SHE MEANT IT WITH ALL OF HER HEART. THE GUYS TELL ME, "YOU GOT ME THROUGH VIETNAM," OR THE WOMEN TELL ME, "I HAD A ROUGH MARRIAGE, AND I'D PLAY YOUR MUSIC AND I COULD GO ANOTHER DAY." AND I THINK, "WELL, NOW, THAT'S-- THAT'S WHAT I'M LIVING FOR. THAT'S MY CALL. THAT'S MY REASON."

BILLY WALKER: ♪ I'D LIKE TO BE IN CHARLIE'S SHOES... ♪ STUART: MATCHING PINK SUITS WITH PURPLE PIPING. THE HATS, THE BELTS, THE GUITAR STRAPS, AND WHEN ERNEST GOT OFF THE BUS, HE WAS WEARING A PINSTRIPE SUIT AND A WHITE HAT AND A WHITE SHIRT AND--AND A RED SCARF, AND HE LOOKED 50 FEET TALL TO ME. NARRATOR: MANY OF THE STARS GOT THEIR FLASHY CLOTHES FROM NUDIE COHN'S SHOP IN HOLLYWOOD, WHERE MANUEL CUEVAS WAS THE HEAD TAILOR, WORKING ON DESIGNS THE ARTISTS SUGGESTED. CUEVAS: I HAD PEOPLE, FRIENDS, THAT WERE KINGS IN THE COUNTRY MUSIC.

NEWMAN CALLED HIMSELF "THE ALLIGATOR MAN" AND WANTED HIS COSTUME TO REFLECT IT. ONE OF HANK SNOW'S FAVORITE OUTFITS FEATURED TURTLES AND FROGS. WALKER: ♪ ...BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE... ♪ ANDERSON: I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT AN ENTERTAINER SHOULD LOOK UNIQUE. I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT PEOPLE BUY TICKETS FOR. I DON'T THINK THEY BUY A TICKET TO SEE THEIR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR. BUT, AS FAR AS THEM BEING COMFORTABLE, THEY WERE HEAVY. OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU GET OUT ON A-- ON A SUMMER STAGE AT A FAIRGROUNDS IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST, IN THE DAYTIME, YOU'RE WEARING ONE OF THOSE THINGS, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE 10 POUNDS WHILE YOU'RE OUT THERE TRYING TO SING. NARRATOR: FOR MOST PERFORMERS, THE LONG MILES AND CEASELESS TRAVEL WERE SIMPLY A FACT OF LIFE. ["WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN" BY BOBBY HORTON PLAYING] LARRY GATLIN: GET IN AND OUT OF AIRPLANES; IN AND OUT OF BUSES; IN AND OUT OF HOTELS; EATING ON THE ROAD-- IT IS A JOB. SO, ONE THAT WE LOVE, BUT FOR ANYBODY WHO THINKS IT'S ALL GLAMOUR AND IT'S ALL THIS, YOU GO DO THAT SHOW AND GET THROUGH AT 10:00 AND THEN SLEEP FOR ABOUT 600 MILES AT 80 MILES AN HOUR AND GET UP AND DO A 2:00 MATINEE IN THE MIDDLE OF IOWA, WHEN-- YOU KNOW, IN THE SUMMER, WHEN IT'S 105. RAY BENSON: THE GUYS IN THE BAND MAKE A JOKE. HE SAYS, "WE DON'T GET PAID FOR PLAYING. WE GET PAID FOR RIDING." HEH HEH HEH! AND THERE WASN'T ANY INTERSTATES IN THEM DAYS. I THINK THEY HAD THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE, AND IT WAS ALL BEAT UP. IT--IT WAS--GET ON THAT THING, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD CHURN BUTTER ON THAT DAMN THING. ANNOUNCER: LET'S WELCOME JOHNNY CASH!

NARRATOR: BY 1964, JOHNNY CASH WAS HEADLINING TOURS THAT PLAYED TO PACKED AUDITORIUMS IN MAJOR CITIES, NOT BUCOLIC COUNTRY MUSIC PARKS. HIS SHOWS FEATURED A GOSPEL QUARTET FROM VIRGINIA CALLED THE STATLER BROTHERS; CARL PERKINS, CASH'S OLD FRIEND FROM HIS ROCKABILLY YEARS; AND MAYBELLE CARTER AND HER 3 DAUGHTERS, HELEN, ANITA, AND JUNE. CASH ALSO ASKED MANUEL CUEVAS TO MAKE HIS OUTFITS, BUT HE DIDN'T WANT FLASHY RHINESTONES AND DESIGNS ON HIS SUITS. HE DRESSED ONLY IN BLACK, AND THOUGH HE WAS BILLED AS A COUNTRY SINGER, CASH WAS FASCINATED WITH ALL FORMS OF AMERICAN MUSIC. DON REID: I'VE NEVER KNOWN A GUY THAT KNEW AS MANY SONGS AS HE DID. HE KNEW EVERY OLD GOSPEL SONG. HE KNEW EVERY OLD POP SONG. HE--HE TAUGHT US A SONG-- WE PUT IT ON AN ALBUM ONE TIME-- A OLD INK SPOTS SONG THAT WE'D NEVER HEARD, AND HE TAUGHT US THE LYRICS TO IT. HE WOULD CARRY A RECORD PLAYER AND STACKS OF RECORDS WITH HIM ON TOUR, AND WE'D SIT IN ROOMS AT NIGHT AND HE'D PLAY ALL THESE OLD FOLK SONGS.

NARRATOR: PETER LA FARGE'S SONG "THE BALLAD OF IRA HAYES" TOLD THE STORY OF A PIMA INDIAN WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MARINES WHO HOISTED THE FLAG AT IWO JIMA. AFTER THE WAR, HAYES HAD DESCENDED INTO ALCOHOLISM AND DIED ALONG A LONELY ROAD ON HIS ARIZONA RESERVATION. ROSANNE CASH: AND HE STARTED TAKING PETER TO SHOWS AND PUTTING HIM ONSTAGE TO SING "IRA HAYES." AND THE AUDIENCES DIDN'T CARE, AND DAD WAS FURIOUS AND DISAPPOINTED. HE WAS TRYING SO HARD. "LISTEN TO THIS GUY. IT'S SO IMPORTANT." NARRATOR: UNDETERRED, CASH DECIDED TO RECORD AN ENTIRE ALBUM, "BITTER TEARS," DEDICATED TO THE NATION'S TROUBLED HISTORY WITH NATIVE AMERICANS.

HIS CONSTANT TOURING CONTINUED TO STRAIN HIS 10-YEAR MARRIAGE TO HIS WIFE VIVIAN, THE MOTHER OF THEIR 4 DAUGHTERS. SHE NOW SUSPECTED, CORRECTLY, THAT HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH JUNE CARTER, WHO TRAVELED WITH CASH AS PART OF HIS PACKAGE SHOWS. BUT HIS BASS PLAYER AND CLOSE FRIEND MARSHALL GRANT WAS EVEN MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS DRUG USE. ROSANNE CASH: MARSHALL NEVER TOOK A DRINK OR A DRUG HIS WHOLE LIFE. HE FELT TREMENDOUSLY PROTECTIVE OF DAD. HE AND JUNE, DURING THE TIME THE CARTER FAMILY WAS ON THE ROAD WITH HIM, THEY WOULD FLUSH PILLS, FIND--GO IN HIS ROOM, FIND HIS PILLS, FLUSH 'EM, UM, DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO GET HIM FROM POINT "A" TO POINT "B" AND SHOW UP FOR THE SHOWS AND NOT BE HIGH. NARRATOR: THE ADDICTION CAUSED CASH TO LOSE WEIGHT, HOLLOWED OUT HIS CHEEKS, MADE HIM FIDGETY AND JUMPY. APPEARING ON PETE SEEGER'S TELEVISION SHOW WITH JUNE CARTER, HE SQUIRMED AND ROCKED IN HIS CHAIR, UNCOMFORTABLY FUSSED WITH HIS HAIR AND SCRATCHED HIS NECK, NERVOUSLY LIT AND RE-LIT A SERIES OF CIGARETTES, EVEN ENDED THE SHOW WITH HIS SHOES OFF. TAKE SOME SHOES OFF. [BOTH LAUGH] NARRATOR: ON TOUR IN EL PASO, CASH WAS ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION OF MORE THAN 1,000 AMPHETAMINES. A PICTURE OF HIM LEAVING THE COURTHOUSE, WITH VIVIAN BY HIS SIDE, MADE NATIONAL NEWS. ROSANNE CASH: SHE WAS SO HUMILIATED. SHE WAS SUCH A PRIVATE PERSON, AND ALL OF HER FRIENDS KNEW. MY MOTHER IS VERY EXOTIC-LOOKING AND HER PEOPLE WERE ITALIAN, AND THE KU KLUX KLAN JUMPED ON THIS PICTURE AND SAID THAT MY DAD WAS MARRIED TO A BLACK WOMAN AND STARTED A FIRESTORM. NARRATOR: THE NATIONAL STATES RIGHTS PARTY IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, REPRINTED THE PHOTO IN ITS NEWSLETTER, SAYING, "MONEY FROM THE SALE OF RECORDS GOES TO SCUM LIKE JOHNNY CASH TO KEEP THEM SUPPLIED WITH DOPE AND NEGRO WOMEN." IT REFERRED TO HIS CHILDREN AS "MONGRELIZED" AND CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF HIS SHOWS AND RECORDS. CASH'S MANAGER MOUNTED A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN THAT EARNED HIS ARTIST SOME SYMPATHY IN THE PRESS, BUT NOTHING HE OR ANYONE ELSE COULD DO SEEMED ABLE TO KEEP CASH AWAY FROM HIS DRUGS. OUT ON THE ROAD, SHOWS WERE CANCELLED, PROMOTERS SUED HIM. IN NASHVILLE, THE PHOTOGRAPHER LES LEVERETT SHOWED UP TO CAPTURE ONE OF HIS RECORDING SESSIONS. CASH ARRIVED 3 HOURS LATE. LES LEVERETT: HE KICKED HIS BOOTS OFF, AND IN HIS, UH, BLACK SOCK FEET, SAT THERE ON THAT STOOL, CARRIED IT OVER TO THE WALL, LEANED HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL WITH A PAD AND A PENCIL, AND STARTED WRITING A SONG. HA HA! HE'S PAYING FOR THIS SESSION; THAT'S COMING OUT OF HIS ROYALTY. INSTEAD OF DOING IT 3 WEEKS AGO AND BRINGING IT WITH HIM, HE'S WRITING A SONG. ♪ WERE YOU THERE... NARRATOR: AND AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY ONE NIGHT, HE ENDED HIS SET BY SMASHING ALL THE FOOTLIGHTS WITH HIS MICROPHONE STAND. THE MANAGERS TOLD HIM HE WAS NO LONGER WELCOME AT THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM. CASH: ♪ ...MY LORD... NARRATOR: IN 1966, VIVIAN FILED FOR DIVORCE. THAT SAME YEAR, JUNE CARTER DIVORCED HER SECOND HUSBAND, AND THOUGH SHE LOVED JOHNNY CASH, TURNED DOWN HIS REPEATED REQUESTS THAT THEY GET MARRIED. HE SEEMED TOO INTENT ON DESTROYING HIMSELF. CASH: ♪ TREMBLE GENE? YEAH, ROD? HAVE ANY SPOT IN YOUR BAND FOR ROGER MILLER, THE FIDDLE PLAYER? I DON'T KNOW. WE COULD GIVE IT A TRY. HEY, ROGER, COME ON IN HERE, WILL YOU, PLEASE? AHEM.

HE SAID, "DID YOU EVER NOTICE HOW MUCH WEIGHT A CHICKEN CAN GAIN AND NEVER SHOW IT IN THE FACE?" MILLER: SOMETHING LIKE... [MAKES CHUGGING SOUND] [BAND PLAYING ALONG] I WAS IN THE WRONG KEY, BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. ANDERSON: ROGER HAD A GREAT COUNTRY SOUL DEEP DOWN INSIDE HIM. HE HAD LIVED, HE'D BEEN HURT. HE HAD BEEN ABANDONED, OF-- OF A SORT, IN HIS CHILDHOOD, AND HE HAD A LOT OF SCARS, AND HE COVERED UP THOSE SCARS IN TWO WAYS: ONE BY WRITING SONGS, LIKE "INVITATION TO THE BLUES" AND "WHEN TWO WORLDS COLLIDE," AND THEN BY WRITING "DANG ME" AND "DO WACKA DOO" AND "YOU CAN'T ROLLER SKATE IN A BUFFALO HERD." [PLAYING "ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL"] ♪ NARRATOR: ROGER MILLER, FROM AN IMPOVERISHED FAMILY IN OKLAHOMA, HAD COME TO NASHVILLE AS A FIDDLER AND WORKED FOR A TIME AS A HOTEL BELLHOP. HE WAS NOW AN ESTABLISHED SONGWRITER, WHOSE LIGHTNING WIT AND MANIC SENSE OF HUMOR ENDEARED HIM TO EVERYONE HE MET. BUT HIS DREAM OF BECOMING A MAJOR SINGING STAR IN HIS OWN RIGHT HAD NEVER MATERIALIZED; 4 DIFFERENT LABELS HAD DROPPED HIM IN 6 YEARS BECAUSE OF WEAK RECORD SALES. MILLER: ♪ YOUR WORLD WAS SO DIFFERENT... ♪ NARRATOR: DESPITE HIS HEAVY USE OF AMPHETAMINES, MILLER-- UNLIKE JOHNNY CASH-- NEVER LET IT KEEP HIM FROM SHOWING UP TO PERFORM. "HOW LONG CAN HE STAY UP?" ONE CONCERT PROMOTER ASKED HIS TOUR MANAGER. "I DON'T KNOW," THE MAN ANSWERED. "I'VE ONLY BEEN WITH HIM A YEAR AND HALF. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE WAS UP BEFORE THEN." RALPH EMERY: I THINK IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT ROGER MILLER WAS THE "KING OF PILL TAKERS." ROGER SAID, "YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU KEEP YOUR CHANGE AND WHERE YOU KEEP YOUR PILLS." HE SAID, "THE OTHER NIGHT I GOT CONFUSED, AND 'FORE I KNEW IT, I'D TAKEN 35 CENTS." HA HA HA! NARRATOR: IN EARLY 1964, MILLER HAD GIVEN UP AND DECIDED TO LEAVE FOR HOLLYWOOD, WHERE HE HOPED TO FIND WORK AS A COMIC ON TELEVISION. BUT HE WAS BROKE AND NEEDED MONEY FOR THE MOVE. AS A FAVOR, HIS PRODUCER ARRANGED TO PAY HIM $100 A SONG IF HE'D COME IN FOR TWO DAYS OF RECORDING. MILLER SHOWED UP WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN OF THE SILLIER SONGS HE HAD WRITTEN. ONE OF THEM WAS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A MARRIED MAN WHO SPENDS ALL OF HIS MONEY BUYING DRINKS FOR HIS FRIENDS.

ROGER MILLER WOULD GO ON TO HAVE HIS OWN NETWORK TELEVISION SHOW, OPEN UP A "KING OF THE ROAD" MOTOR INN, WRITE SONGS FOR A BROADWAY MUSICAL AND A WALT DISNEY MOVIE, TRAVEL TO PERFORMANCES IN A PRIVATE JET. AND WHENEVER HE VISITED NASHVILLE, HE MADE A POINT OF STAYING AT THE MOST EXPENSIVE SUITE AT THE ANDREW JACKSON HOTEL, WHERE HE HAD ONCE WORKED AS A BELLHOP.

THE LOVIN' SPOONFUL: ♪ WELL, THERE'S THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND 52 GUITAR PICKERS IN NASHVILLE... ♪ NARRATOR: AMONG THE BUSIEST WERE THE MUSICIANS WHO BACKED UP THE SINGING STARS DURING RECORDING SESSIONS IN THE STUDIOS ON MUSIC ROW. THEY WERE ALL VIRTUOSOS ON THE INSTRUMENTS THEY PLAYED. EACH 3-HOUR SESSION WAS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A USABLE TAKE ON 3 OR 4 SONGS, WHOSE ARRANGEMENTS WERE USUALLY IMPROVISED COLLABORATIVELY ON THE SPOT. CHARLIE McCOY: THE WAY A TYPICAL NASHVILLE SESSION WORKS, WHEN YOU'RE CALLED FOR A SESSION, THERE'S NO PREPARATION. WHEN YOU HIT THE DOOR, YOU HEAR THE SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME. NARRATOR: PRODUCERS DREW FROM A CORE GROUP OF SESSION MUSICIANS. THEY WERE CALLED THE "A-TEAM." IT INCLUDED THE PIANO PLAYERS FLOYD CRAMER AND HARGUS "PIG" ROBBINS, WHO HAD BEEN BLIND SINCE AGE 4. BUDDY HARMAN PLAYED THE DRUMS. ON BASS, BOB MOORE WOULD TAKE PART IN 18,000 SESSIONS, MORE THAN 50,000 SONGS. PETE DRAKE MASTERED THE INTRICACIES OF THE PEDAL STEEL. SO DID LLOYD GREEN. [GREEN PLAYING PEDAL STEEL GUITAR] NARRATOR: AMONG THE TOP GUITARISTS WERE GRADY MARTIN, HANK GARLAND, JERRY KENNEDY, RAY EDENTON, VELMA SMITH, AND HAROLD BRADLEY, WHO WOULD BECOME THE MOST-RECORDED GUITARIST IN MUSIC HISTORY. McCOY: I WAS CALLED TO PLAY ON "ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL" WITH JOHNNY CASH. ALWAYS BEEN A FIDDLE TUNE, AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KIND OF GET THE SAME MOOD. ON THE CHORUS PART, THE FIDDLE ALWAYS GOES INTO THAT RECOGNIZABLE, UH, TRAIN LITTLE THING. SO I DECIDED TO TRY TO REPLICATE THAT. [PLAYING "ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL" ON HARMONICA] NARRATOR: CHARLIE McCOY WAS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS HARMONICA, BUT HE COULD PLAY ALMOST ANY INSTRUMENT. I PLAY A LITTLE SAX, A LITTLE TRUMPET. TRUMPET ON "RAINY DAY WOMEN #12 AND 35" BY BOB DYLAN; BARITONE SAX ON "PRETTY WOMAN," ROY ORBISON; 'COURSE, I PLAYED BASS ON 3 DYLAN ALBUMS; JEANNIE SEELY, "DON'T TOUCH ME"; CHARLIE RICH, "MOHAIR SAM"; PLAYED ORGAN ON "EASY LOVING," FREDDY HART; PLAYED VIBES AND BELLS ON "BLUE VELVET," BOBBY VINTON; BUT MORE HARMONICA THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

BARE: ♪ ...I WENT TO SLEEP IN DETROIT... ♪ NARRATOR: A TYPICAL WEEK FOR A MEMBER OF THE A-TEAM WAS 15 TO 20 SESSIONS, EACH LASTING 3 HOURS: 10 A.M. TO 1 P.M., 2:00 TO 5:00, 6:00 TO 9:00, AND 10 P.M. TO 1 A.M. McCOY: CHECK YOUR EGO AT THE DOOR. THE SONG AND THE ARTIST ARE THE PICTURE, WE'RE THE FRAME. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE THIS SONG BETTER. MOST OF THE TIME, LESS IS BETTER. THE GUY THAT REALLY SET ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WAS THE GREAT GUITARIST GRADY MARTIN, WHO WAS THE SESSION LEADER FOR ALL OF OWEN BRADLEY'S SESSIONS. I'M 21 YEARS OLD. I'M LIVING MY DREAM. I'M PLAYING WITH THE NASHVILLE MUSICIANS, I'M PLAYING WITH BIG COUNTRY MUSIC STARS, AND I WAS FEELING MY OATS. AND ONE DAY, WE'RE ON A SESSION, AND HE SAID, "YOU'RE PLAYING TOO MUCH." HE SAID, "YOU LISTEN TO THE LYRICS. "IF YOU CAN'T HEAR AND UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD, YOU'RE PLAYING TOO MUCH." LLOYD GREEN: WE CUT A LOT OF BRILLIANT STUFF. WE CUT A LOT OF JUNK STUFF, TOO. I MEAN--I MEAN, TO BE HONEST, IT--YOU CAN'T CUT 4 SONGS EVERY 3 HOURS AND DO 3 AND 4 SESSIONS A--A DAY AND YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT, AND NOT HAVE A LOT OF DISASTERS.

["WHO YA HUNCHIN'" BY CHICK WEBB AND HIS ORCHESTRA PLAYING] MANY OF NASHVILLE'S UPPER-CLASS CITIZENS--WHO, FOR YEARS, HAD LOOKED DOWN THEIR NOSES AT THE OPRY, ITS MUSIC, ITS STARS, AND THE KIND OF PEOPLE IT ATTRACTED--FEARED THAT THE "ATHENS OF THE SOUTH," AS THEY CALLED THEIR TOWN, WAS BEING RUINED FOREVER. TOM T. HALL: YOU KNOW, THE ARISTOCRACY OF NASHVILLE, THEY DIDN'T WANT NASHVILLE TO BE "MUSIC CITY U.S.A." WE DON'T WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR HILLBILLY MUSIC, YOU KNOW? SOME OF THEM WOULD TRAVEL TO EUROPE; WHEN THEY'D SAY, "WHERE ARE YOU FROM?" "NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE." "OH, THE GRAND OLE OPRY?" AND THEY'D SAY, "OH, HOLY ...," YOU KNOW, "THAT COUNTRY MU--HILLBILLY MUSIC FOLLOWING US ALL OVER THE WORLD." NARRATOR: ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO REPAIR RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO CULTURES IN TOWN WAS SARAH OPHELIA CANNON. SHE LIVED IN ONE OF NASHVILLE'S MOST EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS, RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. SARAH OPHELIA CANNON WAS ALSO KNOWN AS MINNIE PEARL... PEARL: HOW-DEE! CROWD: HOW-DEE! NARRATOR: AS MUCH A FIXTURE ON THE RYMAN STAGE AS ROY ACUFF AND EVEN MORE BELOVED. SHE WAS REALLY A VERY SOPHISTICATED LADY. SHE--SHE BELONGED TO A BRIDGE CLUB. SHE PLAYED TENNIS OVER HERE AT BELLE MEADE WITH 4 OR 5 OTHER LADIES, AND SHE COULD JUST PUT THAT HAT ON AND SHE COULD BE "COUSIN MINNIE PEARL," OR SHE COULD TAKE IT OFF AND BE OPHELIA CANNON. NARRATOR: MARGARET ANN ROBINSON, WHOSE FAMILY OWNED WSM AND THE GRAND OLE OPRY, OFTEN ENLISTED HER TO RAISE MONEY FROM THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FOR HIGH-BROW CAUSES. ROBINSON: NASHVILLE WAS CELEBRATING AN ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN. AND SO I WENT OUT TO SARAH'S ONE MORNING TO TALK TO HER ABOUT HER PART IN THIS THING, IN THIS CITY-WIDE CELEBRATION. IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR CONVERSATION, SHE SAID, "OOP, WE GOT TO GO. FOLLOW ME TO THE MAILBOX." AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, SARAH, CAN'T YOU WAIT TILL WE-- I LEAVE TO GET THE MAIL?" "MM-MMM." SO WE WALKED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND COMING AROUND THE HILL, I COULD SEE ONE OF THE SIGHTSEEING BUSES IN NASHVILLE. THEY STOPPED AT HER MAILBOX LIKE THEY ALWAYS DID AND OPENED THE DOOR, AND SHE CLIMBED ON THE BUS. AND SHE'D SAY, "HOW-DEE! I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU!" THOSE PEOPLE IN THE BUS WOULD GO HOME AND THEY'D SAY, "WE MET MINNIE PEARL." THEN SHE WAS SARAH CANNON AGAIN, AND WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE'D GO EAT FOR LUNCH OR WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO IN THIS NASHVILLE CELEBRATION. NARRATOR: EVENTUALLY, THE CITY SURRENDERED, PUTTING UP SIGNS READING "WELCOME TO NASHVILLE, HOME OF THE GRAND OLE OPRY, MUSIC CITY U.S.A.," THOUGH THE OLD SIGNS WELCOMING VISITORS TO THE "ATHENS OF THE SOUTH" REMAINED IN PLACE, TOO.

["BUCKAROO" BY BUCK OWENS PLAYING] NARRATOR: 2,000 MILES WEST OF NASHVILLE, IN CALIFORNIA'S SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, A DIFFERENT KIND OF COUNTRY MUSIC-- UNAFRAID OF ITS ROUGH EDGES-- WAS COMING OUT OF THE SMOKY DANCE HALLS IN BAKERSFIELD. MERLE HAGGARD: THERE WAS NIGHT LIFE LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. THERE WAS 25 BEER JOINTS WITH A BAND IN EVERY ONE OF THEM. SOME BARS PLAYED MUSIC 24 HOURS A DAY. IT WAS ONE BIG CARNIVAL. IF YOU WERE TO BRING SOMEBODY BACK FROM THE DEAD THAT LIVED AT THAT TIME, TURN 'EM LOOSE OVER RIGHT NOW, THEY'D BE IN JAIL IN AN HOUR. NARRATOR: THE MUSIC BEING PLAYED CAME TO BE CALLED THE BAKERSFIELD SOUND. JEANNIE SEELY: TO ME, THERE WAS ALWAYS A SHARP EDGE ON CALIFORNIA COUNTRY MUSIC, THAT--THAT RIM SHOT, WE CALL IT, ON THE DRUMS, ALMOST; TO ME, IT WAS LIKE FIRING A GUN, WHERE, UH, IN NASHVILLE, THE SONG WAS-- THE--THE SOUND WAS BECOMING MORE POLISHED. NARRATOR: AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL WAS BUCK OWENS AND HIS BUCKAROOS. ["STREETS OF LAREDO" PLAYING] NARRATOR: ALVIS EDGAR OWENS JR. WAS BORN TO A FAMILY OF SHARECROPPERS IN 1929 IN NORTH TEXAS, JUST ACROSS THE RED RIVER FROM OKLAHOMA. BEFORE HE WAS 4, HE ADOPTED THE NICKNAME "BUCK" AFTER A MULE HE ADMIRED. RUINED BY THE DUST BOWL, IN 1937 HIS DESPERATE FAMILY STRUCK OUT FOR CALIFORNIA, BUT THEY ONLY MADE IT AS FAR AS MESA, ARIZONA, WHERE THEY TOOK WHATEVER FARM JOBS THEY COULD FIND. "WHEN I GET BIG," OWENS REMEMBERED THINKING, "I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO BED HUNGRY AND I'M NOT GOING TO WEAR HAND-ME-DOWN CLOTHES." HE QUIT SCHOOL IN NINTH GRADE IN ORDER TO WORK: WASHING CARS, PICKING ORANGES, AND PLAYING GUITAR IN LOCAL HONKY-TONKS. BY 1951, OWENS HAD MOVED TO BAKERSFIELD, PERFORMING AT ONE OF ITS ROWDY DANCE HALLS WITH THE ORANGE BLOSSOM PLAYBOYS AND SITTING IN AS A SESSION GUITARIST IN LOS ANGELES AT CAPITOL RECORDS.

I REMEMBER HEARING A BUCK OWENS SONG AND JUST BEING BLOWN AWAY BY IT 'CAUSE HE CAME OUT OF THE RADIO SO DIFFERENT. BUCK CAME OUT WITH ALL THE BRIGHTNESS AND NO BASS, JUST ALL TREBLE GUITAR.

"I ALWAYS WANTED TO SOUND LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE COMIN' RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT ROOM," HE SAID. FANS RESPONDED TO HIS HARD-CORE APPROACH. ON ONE RECORD, BOTH THE "A" AND "B" SIDES TRADED PLACES AT NUMBER ONE ON THE COUNTRY CHARTS. SO THAT NO ONE COULD MISTAKE WHERE HE STOOD, HE PUBLISHED A PLEDGE IN NASHVILLE'S "MUSIC CITY NEWS": "I SHALL SING NO SONG THAT IS NOT A COUNTRY SONG," HE WROTE. "I SHALL MAKE NO RECORD THAT IS NOT A COUNTRY RECORD. "I REFUSE TO BE KNOWN AS ANYTHING BUT A COUNTRY SINGER. "I AM PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH COUNTRY MUSIC. "COUNTRY MUSIC AND COUNTRY MUSIC FANS "HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM TODAY. AND I SHALL NOT FORGET IT." YOAKAM: AND BUCK HAD A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER, AND IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REALLY WRITE ABOUT THAT IN HIS MUSIC. BUCK WAS VERY EFFERVESCENT IN HIS MUSIC. AND IT'S A WAY FOR HIM TO COPE, I THINK, WITH WHAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH GROWING UP, SO IT'S ALWAYS THERE IN THE TENSION, UNDERNEATH THE EXPOSED PART OF HIS SONGS AND SONGWRITING.

THE HARD-WON CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 BANNED EMPLOYERS AND PUBLIC PLACES FROM DENYING THEM JOBS OR PROVIDING THEM EQUAL ACCESS TO EVERYTHING FROM DRINKING FOUNTAINS TO SEATS IN CAFETERIAS OR ON A BUS. AND IN 1965, PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON SIGNED A BILL OVERRIDING STATE LAWS MEANT TO KEEP BLACK PEOPLE FROM EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. THAT FALL, IN NASHVILLE, A 31-YEAR-OLD FROM SLEDGE, MISSISSIPPI WITH A DEEP, RESONANT VOICE ENTERED A STUDIO TO RECORD SOME COUNTRY SONGS FOR THE FIRST TIME. HIS NAME WAS CHARLEY PRIDE. MY DAD USED TO SAY, NOW, "PRIDE. JUST THINK ABOUT THE NAME ITSELF." HE SAID, "WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, YOU WANT TO TRY TO DO IT GOOD AND DO IT QUICK." PRIDE: ♪ SO I FEEL SO BLUE SOMETIMES I WANNA DIE ♪ RUCKER: THE REASON HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT IN COUNTRY MUSIC WAS BECAUSE OF HIS VOICE.

PRIDE: I GREW UP AND WALKED 4 MILES TO SCHOOL, 4 MILES BACK, THAT KIND OF THING. BUT THE WHITES HAD A BUS. WE DIDN'T HAVE A BUS. I'M WALKING TO SCHOOL, I WALKED WAY OVER TO THE SIDE 'CAUSE THEY HAD POTHOLES AND IT WAS A GRAVEL ROAD.

I ALWAYS WANTED BE SOMEWHERE AND DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN PICKING COTTON BESIDE MY DAD. I USED TO SIT ON THE PORCH AND I'D LOOK UP AT THE CLOUDS. AND I SAID, "BOY, I'D BE-- TO FLOAT ON THEM CLOUDS." AND I'D THINK OF THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT IT WOULD BE. SO WHEN I SAW JACKIE ROBINSON GO TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES, I SAID, "THERE'S MY OUT OF THE COTTON FIELD." [CROWD CHEERING] NARRATOR: HIS ABILITY AS A PITCHER LANDED HIM A SPOT ON THE MEMPHIS RED SOX IN THE NEGRO LEAGUE WHEN PRIDE WAS STILL A TEENAGER. HE LATER MOVED TO HELENA, MONTANA, WHERE HE PLAYED ON A MINOR LEAGUE TEAM AND WORKED IN A SMELTING PLANT. BUT HE HAD ALSO GROWN UP LISTENING TO THE GRAND OLE OPRY, ADMIRING HANK WILLIAMS, AND IN MONTANA, HE BEGAN PERFORMING IN A LOCAL BAR. PASSING THROUGH TOWN, OPRY STARS RED FOLEY AND RED SOVINE HEARD HIM SINGING WILLIAMS' "LOVESICK BLUES," AND WERE IMPRESSED ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO TRY NASHVILLE. PRIDE SHOWED UP IN MUSIC CITY, WHERE HE CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF COWBOY JACK CLEMENT, THE MAVERICK PRODUCER AND SONGWRITER. MAN: I THOUGHT COUNTRY MUSIC WAS GETTING A LITTLE STALE AT THAT TIME.

I SAID, "FARON, YOU DO YOURSELF." BUT HE WOULD SING ONE, AND I WOULD SING ONE. HE WOULD SING ONE, AND I WOULD SING ONE. AND, FINALLY, HE SAID, "WELL, I'LL BE. "WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT I'M SITTING HERE SINGING WITH A JIG AND DON'T MIND." NARRATOR: BUT MOST OF THE LABELS IN NASHVILLE WEREN'T INTERESTED IN SIGNING HIM. THEN, CHET ATKINS TOOK THE TAPES TO HIS BOSSES AT RCA-- WAITING UNTIL THEY LIKED WHAT THEY HEARD BEFORE SHOWING THEM A PHOTOGRAPH OF PRIDE. THEY DECIDED TO RELEASE HIS EARLY SINGLES WITHOUT MAKING ANY MENTION OF PRIDE'S RACE. MANY OF THE RADIO DISC JOCKEYS-- AND THE PEOPLE LISTENING-- ASSUMED HE WAS JUST ANOTHER WHITE, SOUTHERN COUNTRY SINGER. EMERY: I WAS EMCEEING A SHOW IN DETROIT. WE HAD ABOUT 18,000 PEOPLE, AND WHEN I WENT OUT, I SAID, "HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE FROM THE SOUTH? FIRST, SECOND, THIRD GENERATION?" MOST OF THE HANDS WENT UP. PRIDE WAS ABOUT THE THIRD ACT ON.

NARRATOR: WHEN HIS SINGLE, "JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME," REACHED NUMBER 10 ON THE COUNTRY CHARTS, CHARLEY PRIDE'S CAREER WAS LAUNCHED, THOUGH, FOR A WHILE, HIS LABEL WAS STILL SKITTISH ABOUT WHICH SONGS HE RECORDED-- ESPECIALLY LOVE SONGS. THEY TURNED DOWN HIS REQUEST TO SING CURLY PUTMAN'S "GREEN, GREEN GRASS OF HOME."

NARRATOR: WHEN MERLE RONALD HAGGARD WAS BORN IN 1937, HIS FAMILY HAD ALREADY BEEN LIVING NEAR BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA FOR 3 YEARS-- HAVING FLED OKLAHOMA AFTER A FIRE DESTROYED THEIR FARM DURING THE DEPRESSION. THEY WERE STILL LOOKED DOWN UPON AS "OKIES." HAGGARD: ♪ ...HAD THE LUXURIES SHE WANTED ♪ NARRATOR: HAGGARD'S FATHER HAD FOUND WORK ON THE RAILROAD, BUT THEY NEEDED A PERMANENT PLACE TO LIVE. THERE WAS A LADY NAMED "MISS BONA," WHO OWNED A--A LOT WITH A BOXCAR SETTING ON IT, REFRIGERATOR CAR, AND SHE SAID, UH... "IF YOU HAVE A MIND TO BE A HARD ENOUGH WORKER, YOU COULD PROBABLY MAKE THIS INTO A PRETTY NICE HOME," SHE SAID, "BUT I NEVER HEARD OF AN OKIE THAT WOULD WORK." AND MY DAD TOOK A LITTLE OFFENSE TO THAT AND HE SAID, "WELL, MA'AM, I NEVER HEARD OF ONE THAT WOULDN'T WORK." NARRATOR: HAGGARD WAS ONLY 9 YEARS OLD WHEN HIS FATHER DIED FROM A STROKE. "SOMETHING," HE SAID LATER, "WENT OUT OF THE WORLD THAT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO REPLACE." TO FILL THE GAP, HIS MOTHER ENCOURAGED MERLE'S BUDDING INTEREST IN MUSIC, HOPING IT WOULD KEEP HIM OUT OF TROUBLE. IT DIDN'T. HE RAN AWAY FOR A WHILE AT AGE 10 BY HOPPING A FREIGHT TRAIN, THEN RAN AWAY AGAIN AT 14, HITCHHIKING ALL THE WAY TO TEXAS AND BACK. HIS FRESHMAN YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE SHOWED UP A TOTAL OF 10 DAYS.

"LEFTY," HE SAID, "GAVE ME THE COURAGE TO DREAM." HAGGARD SPENT MOST OF HIS TEENAGE YEARS RUNNING FROM THE LAW. HE WAS CONSTANTLY ARRESTED FOR TRUANCY-- AND JUST AS CONSTANTLY ESCAPING FROM JUVENILE DETENTION CENTERS. MARRIED AT AGE 17, HE STARTED SELLING STOLEN SCRAP IRON, GOT CAUGHT, AND WAS JAILED, ONLY TO ESCAPE AGAIN. [CHUCKLES] SOMEBODY WAS ALWAYS AFTER ME, SEEMED LIKE. I ESCAPED 17 TIMES FROM DIFFERENT PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. I WAS, UH, BONNIE AND CLYDE ALL ROLLED INTO ONE, JUST RUNNING FROM THE LAW, DOING TIME WHEN THEY'D CATCH ME. NARRATOR: IN 1957, THE POLICE BROUGHT HIM IN FOR A MINOR BURGLARY. THIS TIME, BASED ON HIS RAP SHEET OF ESCAPES, MORE THAN THE SEVERITY OF ANY OF HIS CRIMES, HE WAS SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN SAN QUENTIN, A MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON. NO ONE HAD ESCAPED FROM IT IN 8 YEARS. MERLE HAGGARD BECAME PRISONER NUMBER A-45200, CONFINED WITH SEVERAL THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST HARDENED CRIMINALS, SOME OF THEM ON DEATH ROW. HE WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND INTENT AS EVER ON BREAKING OUT. AN INMATE EVERYONE CALLED RABBIT INVITED HAGGARD TO JOIN IN ON AN ESCAPE HE WAS PLOTTING, BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE ADVISED THE YOUNG MAN NOT TO TAKE PART IN THE DANGEROUS PLAN. "YOU CAN SING AND WRITE SONGS," HE TOLD HAGGARD. "YOU CAN BE SOMEBODY SOMEDAY." IT WAS A BIG DECISION TO NOT GO. BUT IT WAS KIND OF NEAT TO KNOW THAT I COULD GET OUT OF THERE IF I WANTED TO. NARRATOR: HAGGARD TOOK THE ADVICE. RABBIT'S ESCAPE WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR A TIME. BUT DURING HIS RECAPTURE, HE KILLED A POLICEMAN, WAS BROUGHT BACK TO SAN QUENTIN, AND LATER EXECUTED. HAGGARD: SAN QUENTIN. SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME THERE. THERE WAS A TIME WHERE I--I CAME TO THE FORK IN THE ROAD AND TOOK IT, YOU MIGHT SAY.

THE PERFORMER WAS JOHNNY CASH, AND HAGGARD BECAME INSPIRED THAT SOMEDAY HE, TOO, MIGHT BE A STAR.

RODE A GREYHOUND BUS UP THERE EVERY TIME SHE COULD AFFORD TO COME. AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE, AM THE ONLY ONE, IN OUR WHOLE FAMILY TO HAVE EVER BEEN TO JAIL. SO SHE HAD A LOT OF GUFF FROM THE REST OF THE FAMILY, I'M SURE. AND, UH, IT WAS GOOD WHEN I STARTED GETTING POPULAR BECAUSE SHE KIND OF GOT BACK AT THEM. NARRATOR: PAROLED AFTER 2 1/2 YEARS, HE RETURNED TO BAKERSFIELD AND TOOK A DAY JOB DIGGING DITCHES. 7 NIGHTS A WEEK, HE PLAYED MUSIC IN THE CITY'S HONKY-TONKS: THE HIGH POCKETS, RAINBOW GARDENS, THE LUCKY SPOT. HE TOURED BRIEFLY WITH BUCK OWENS, PLAYING BASS WITH THE BUCKAROOS. IN 1965, HE MARRIED THE SINGER BONNIE OWENS, BUCK'S FORMER WIFE, AND RECORDED DUETS WITH HER. THEN HAGGARD'S SOLO CAREER STARTED PICKING UP STEAM ON ITS OWN. SOME OF THE SONGS HE WROTE-- "SWINGING DOORS" AND "THE BOTTLE LET ME DOWN"-- WERE CLASSIC HONKY-TONK TUNES WITH A BAKERSFIELD SOUND. BUT INCREASINGLY, HE TURNED TO THEMES REFLECTING HIS OWN EXPERIENCES: "SING ME BACK HOME," DRAWN FROM HIS TIME IN PRISON; "MAMA TRIED," ABOUT HIS RECKLESS YOUNGER YEARS; AND "HUNGRY EYES," ABOUT GROWING UP POOR. PEOPLE STARTED CALLING HIM THE POET OF THE COMMON MAN.

I WENT BLAZING THROUGH THE HOUSE TO TELL MAMA. SO MY MOTHER, MY SISTER JENNIFER, AND I WENT TO SEE CONNIE AT THE CHOCTAW INDIAN FAIR, ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.

SHE STARTED WRITING SONGS AT AGE 5-- HER FIRST ONE, "LITTLE TINY TASSELTOP," WAS INSPIRED BY THE DOLL HER FATHER HAD MADE FOR HER OUT OF A CORNCOB. GRADE-SCHOOL TEACHERS RECOGNIZED HER REMARKABLE ABILITY AT MEMORIZING ALMOST ANYTHING. BY THE TIME SHE WAS 10, SHE WAS MAKING $20 A WEEK APPEARING ON A KNOXVILLE TELEVISION SHOW, THOUGH NONE OF HER FAMILY COULD WATCH IT SINCE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A TV SET AT HOME.

MAYBELLE CARTER TRIED KINDNESS, JUST AS SHE HAD DONE WITH HANK WILLIAMS. CARTER: GRANDMA WOULD GET THAT LITTLE CUP OF COFFEE AND SHE'D SIT THERE AND SHE'D PLAY CARDS AND SMOKE CIGARETTES AND TALK AND LAUGH AND GIGGLE AND TELL JOKES ALL NIGHT LONG. WELL, THAT WAS FINE WITH JOHN, SO HE ALWAYS HAD A SOFT PLACE TO LAND. NARRATOR: FINALLY, JUNE GAVE HIM AN ULTIMATUM: IF HE WANTED HER TO MARRY HIM, HE HAD TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP TO FIGHT HIS DRUG HABIT. A DOCTOR WAS BROUGHT IN, AND FOR WEEKS, HE AND JUNE AND HER PARENTS KEPT CONSTANT WATCH OVER CASH AT HIS HOUSE NEAR NASHVILLE-- TAKING AWAY ANY PILLS HE MANAGED TO HIDE AND BLOCKING ANYONE ELSE FROM SHOWING UP WITH FRESH SUPPLIES. CARTER: WHEN HE MADE THAT DECISION TO REALLY, REALLY GET STRAIGHT, THEY, UH, THEY REALLY SURROUNDED HIM AND SAT OUT THERE AT HIS HOUSE, MAMA AND GRANDMA AND GRANDDADDY. THIS WAS THE CONDITION OF, "IF WE'RE GETTING MARRIED, "IF WE'RE GOING TO EVER BE TOGETHER, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE AROUND MY DAUGHTERS. "AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE A FAMILY "WITH YOUR DAUGHTERS, ALL OF US TOGETHER, YOU HAVE GOT TO GET CLEANED UP."

CASH: ♪ ALL OF THIS WAS MEANINGLESS ♪ ♪ 'CAUSE HAPPINESS IS YOU ROSANNE CASH: REDEMPTION THEMES PLAYED OUT IN MY DAD'S LIFE AND HIS CAREER OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

THE SAME GUY WHO SANG, "I SHOT A MAN IN RENO JUST TO WATCH HIM DIE," SANG, "WERE YOU THERE WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED MY LORD?" IN THE SAME SHOW. NARRATOR: CASH'S IDEA WAS TO RECORD A LIVE PERFORMANCE AT A PRISON, SOMETHING HE HAD WANTED TO DO EVER SINCE HIS FIRST PRISON CONCERT BACK IN THE 1950s. HE SETTLED ON THE PLACE THAT HAD INSPIRED ONE OF HIS BIGGEST HITS-- AND NOW THE PLACE HE HOPED WOULD REVIVE HIS CAREER-- FOLSOM PRISON IN CALIFORNIA. ON SATURDAY, JANUARY 13, 1968, CASH ARRIVED AT THE PRISON. WITH HIM WERE THE TENNESSEE THREE: CARL PERKINS, THE STATLER BROTHERS, AND JUNE CARTER. INSIDE, 3,000 INMATES GATHERED IN THE HUGE PRISON CAFETERIA, SEATED AT TABLES BOLTED TO THE FLOOR, WHILE GUARDS WITH SHOTGUNS WATCHED FROM A SAFE PERCH ABOVE IT ALL. PERKINS: ♪ STEP ON MY BLUE SUEDE SHOES ♪ NARRATOR: CARL PERKINS WARMED THEM UP WITH HIS EARLY ROCKABILLY HIT, "BLUE SUEDE SHOES;" THEN THE STATLER BROTHERS PERFORMED "FLOWERS ON THE WALL," WHILE CASH WAITED JUST OFFSTAGE FOR HIS TURN. "I KNEW THIS WAS IT," HE LATER REMEMBERED, "MY CHANCE TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THE TIMES I HAD MESSED UP." MAN: OK, WE'RE READY TO DO THE RECORD SESSION. YOU READY? [CROWD CHEERING] NARRATOR: WHEN HIS TIME CAME, CASH OPENED HIS ACT IN A NEW WAY. MAN: OK. YOU READY? CASH: WE'RE READY. NARRATOR: HE SIMPLY INTRODUCED HIMSELF... CASH: HELLO. I'M JOHNNY CASH.

THEY TOOK HIM IN AS ONE OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE HE ACCEPTED THEM, HE APPRECIATED THEM. AND HE HAD THAT MAGIC ONSTAGE THAT CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE. CASH: ♪ AFTER 7 YEARS BEHIND THESE BARS TOGETHER ♪ NARRATOR: DURING HIS TWO CONCERTS THAT DAY, CASH SEEMED TO BE SINGING DIRECTLY TO EACH PRISONER, CHOOSING SONGS THAT TOUCHED ON LONELINESS AND CONFINEMENT, BAD LUCK AND BAD CHOICES, AS WELL AS IRREPRESSIBLE REBELLION-- SOMETIMES MIXING IN A LITTLE PROFANE BANTER WITH THE AUDIENCE AND TAUNTS AT THE WARDEN. CASH: ♪ ...OF MOTHER IF YOU WILL ♪ JUNE CARTER: ♪ LET'S GO ON DOWN TO JACKSON NARRATOR: WHEN JUNE CARTER JOINED HIM ONSTAGE, THE MEN WENT WILD.

CASH: ♪ GREYSTONE CHAPEL HERE AT FOLSOM ♪ NARRATOR: CASH AND HIS MUSICIANS HAD ONLY LEARNED THE SONG A DAY EARLIER, BUT HE HAD INSISTED ON USING IT AS THE SHOW'S FINALE BECAUSE IT DEALT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF REDEMPTION FOR EVEN THE MOST HARDENED SINNER. CASH: ♪ THE SOUL OF MANY LOST MEN ♪ NARRATOR: THAT SPRING, COLUMBIA RELEASED THE FOLSOM PRISON ALBUM TO RAVE REVIEWS. COMMENTATORS FROM EVERY STYLE OF MUSIC NOW SAW IN HIM SOMETHING THEY ALL COULD AGREE UPON. "TALK ABOUT MAGICAL MYSTERY TOURS," THE "VILLAGE VOICE" SAID, "CASH'S VOICE IS AS THICK AND GRITTY AS EVER, "BUT FILLED WITH THE KIND OF EMOTIONALISM YOU SELDOM FIND IN ROCK." THE "NEW YORK TIMES" CALLED HIS PERFORMANCE "SOUL MUSIC OF A RARE KIND." JAZZ CRITIC NAT HENTOFF PROCLAIMED, "THERE'S NO HEMMING JOHNNY CASH INTO ANY ONE CATEGORY." AND "ROLLING STONE" MAGAZINE, THE BIBLE OF THE EMERGING YOUTH COUNTERCULTURE, PORTRAYED HIM AS AN IMPORTANT ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT REBEL IN THE TRADITION OF ELVIS PRESLEY AND BOB DYLAN. COUNTRY FANS PUSHED CASH'S "FOLSOM PRISON BLUES" TO NUMBER ONE ON THEIR CHARTS, AND THE ALBUM WOULD REMAIN ON THE POP CHARTS FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS, SELLING MORE THAN 3 MILLION COPIES IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE. CASH: ♪ ALL OF THIS WAS... NARRATOR: JOHNNY CASH HAD BECOME A SUPERSTAR. CASH: ♪ HAPPINESS IS YOU ♪ NO MORE... NARRATOR: ONE MONTH AFTER THE FOLSOM PRISON CONCERT, IN FEBRUARY OF 1968, HE PROPOSED TO JUNE CARTER IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE IN CANADA. THIS TIME, SHE ACCEPTED.
