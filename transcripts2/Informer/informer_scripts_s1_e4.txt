 OK, come, come, come. Fire escape, go, now. ALARM SOUNDS SCREAMING GUNSHOTS SCREAMING Go, go, go. Fire escape. It's OK. Come on, fire escape there. BANGING FROM INSIDE TOILET Hey. Hey. Bastard. GUNSHOT At approximately 10:33am, Jin Weijun was shot. He was pronounced dead at 11:47am by doctors at London City Hospital. I should like to state, for the record, that Mr Jin's selfless action that day saved multiple lives. - Yeah, I see Nige now and again. - Mm-hm? - Zipping past in that little lorry of his. - Yeah? Skittle says he'd rather spend another ten years inside than get in a car with him. Is Skittles still right, yeah? Yeah, when he remembers. I wish I could get down there and see him. He's always asking after you. - Yeah? - Yeah. He reckons all that sunshine must have baked your head by now. I told him Charlie's still Charlie. Still likes to check in on everybody. What else could I tell you? Oh, you know Dom went and got gay married. I'm not surprised. He was always a bit of a snappy dresser, wasn't he? The Queen shits in the woods, and you're still an half decent shag, in't you? Shut up. What time's your flight? It's early. I get straight off the plane and straight to work. - I'll be back in a couple of months. - Mm... - I think I'd do all right in Florida. - Yeah. I wish, babe. Hey, Nige. Oh, don't cack yourself. I ain't stalking you. Sharon told me you was here. Couldn't resist. - Little gossip, in't she? - People don't change, do they? No, they don't, no. What can I do for? I don't know. Bumping into you the other day, it was like kicking over an old stone. A lot of bad memories that hadn't seen daylight in donkeys. Everything that went down back then, you know? Me and you. I just never got the chance to put it right. It's no bother, you know? The show has got to go on. Yeah. It bothers me. We shared a lot of spit. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. All right. I hope that's enough for you. Many thanks, mate. What a shithole. Hey, I managed to sneak this past the old guard down there. Are you still a scotch man? Mardy Charlie, always a bad influence, hey? I told you, I've not touched a drop for seven year now. Oh, I thought you just meant the skag, like. Well, you know. One to the other. That's what we say on the programme. They've got you on the good book instead. - Comes with the room. - Oh, yeah? - You marked out all your favourite bits? - Piss off. Need something to put me asleep, you know? Lord be praised, for I see before me a new man. Well, you know. Five years inside do that to you, you know? It was smart enough to get out when you did. Hey, I was just lucky. Yeah, well some men got luck born in them. What was it they used to call you down in Keighley? Oh, yeah, Nigel Theresa, yeah. - Not for a long time now, though. - No. The Saint of Skag Heads. - Yeah, that's right. - Yeah. Ah, they all knew, hey? You see Nige, he'll sort you out with a dose no matter how skint you was. - Yeah. - Yeah. I remember Skittles going mental when he found out you was over there, sharing needles with them brown boys. I stood up for you. I told him. I said, "This is a junkie thing. "It's nothing to do with race." You want to fix Nigel, you got to get him cleaned up. - Yeah, yeah, man... - Wouldn't let it go, would he? Well, weren't in his nature and all, so... Yeah. Whose idea was it to cut them doses with battery acid? Come on. You don't think Skittles was bragging about it the minute them bodies started popping up? That were all him, it weren't me. Never proved owt, anyway, did they? So... Yeah, well, someone had to go down there and give it to 'em. No Paki was buying off Skittles, not with this reputation. You want a hot dose, you got to see the Saint. Nigel Theresa. Rolling round Keighley with a smile on his face, doling out the 10p pistols. Nothing in the good book's going to save you from that. Get out. It's just a trip down memory lane. Get out! There he is. I'll see you round. - OVER HEADPHONES: Come on, man! - GAME SOUND EFFECTS Yo, wait for me to re-spawn. Kash, stop. No, no, no... - I'll shoot at what I want, bro! - Great, now I'm down half a life. - Shoot, team! Shoot, team! - Seen my hoodie? Have you seen me shooting? Get up. Are you blind? Can you not see I'm playing a game? - Don't sit on my clothes, then. - Dickhead. Checkpoint B! What's going on in the world? Where are you off to? Late shift. They work you too hard there. Remember, it's a job, not a career. Anyway, Dadir said Gram was to text him in the morning, then he's going to tell me where to meet. - Any ideas what they want you to do? - Bring a passport. - That's all I was told. - Just a passport? Not a change of clothes? Nope. Bruv, what do I do if they want to put me on a plane to Albania? - You get on it. - For real? Like, are you serious? OK, so, say if they hand me a suicide vest, - you want me to put it on? - That's not going to happen. - You don't know that. - You just focus on the task at hand. Focus on tomorrow. Focus on whether or not your mum stays in this country. You're, like, a deeply unpleasant person. - Anybody ever told you that? - Plenty. Most of them are behind bars. Wearing a wedding ring? Yeah, I am married. I thought you only wore it at home. Well, that's that theory busted. You think the DAC will respect you more if you project a stable home life? It's not complicated. There's the me that's on the job, and there's the me that's at home. Except today you're both. DS Waters, DC Morton. Thank you. Hey, the DAC, he's old school, so when you first speak, stand and introduce yourself. Cheers. Meet the Albanians. The Gramos family. Except none of them are Gramos. And we can presume none of them are family. All aliases. Their names trace back to a cemetery in Pristina. We don't know when they set up shop in London, but they arrived on FC's radar last year, when they muscled the Turks out the East End. Were they active during Kosovo? I'm DC Holly Morton, Sir, from CTSU. I prepared the background sweep on the subjects. Good for you. Sit down and answer the question. We matched the tattoo on one of their subjects to an insignia popular with the Kosovo Liberation Army. Half of that force was mujahideen. El Adoua preyed on the young and hopeless. Your man here don't match the profile. Thus far we've been operating under the belief that El Adoua came to London to establish a cell, but the alias we have to go on is Big Shot. It is possible his contact here runs up the ladder, not down. And Mr Igli Gramos is certainly a rung above. Based on SC's intel, the Gramos family have cornered the market on prostitution, trafficking and narcotics in East London. Where's the penthouse? Where's the Ferrari and the models? The business is dirty, but they're living clean. That money's going elsewhere. DC Morton has gathered some solid intel on this, sir. We tracked an account linked to their shell company, DDLM Consulting. It has a standing balance of £300, but every week there's a cash deposit of 50,000. Sits in the account for 24 hours before it disappears. - Money men. - Yes, sir. 2.5 million a year. Judging by the Turin and Rotterdam attack cells, that's enough to fund five El Adouas. If they stay true to form, their next outgoing will be tomorrow. We'll need to make an application for financials and directed surveillance. You get it on my desk, I'll authorise. Thank you, sir. Follow the money. "Stand up and introduce yourself?" Well, at least now he knows who you are. I'll be honest, I think your case is dog shit. - OK. - Suppositions on suppositions. The Gramos family traced back to the KLA - maybe they're mujahid. They're sending money overseas - maybe they're funding terror networks. All you actually have to connect them to is El Adoua is a shoddy nickname. Big Shot? I call my hubby that after a good shag. Doesn't make him cosy with terrorists. Well, maybe we should put a warrant out on your husband. Naeemah. Six. I thought you couldn't run domestic ops? They let me in the room, if I promise to behave. Takes a hefty pair of bollocks to have the DAC sign off on the word of one source. - We didn't mention a source. - Oh, come on. CTSU can't tell the time of day without asking an asset first. Where did you find him? A pop-up mosque above a kebab shop? What does it matter? Our source is reliable. Let's hope so. If you want, I can have my analyst run him or her or whoever through our grid. That's very charitable of you. What do you think, Holly? Yeah, sure, whatever you want. Name, NI number. As a matter of fact, we're meeting the source later if you want to tag along. Admit it. Almost had you. Find your own assets. Why are we starting so early for? He said be here at this time. We're here at this time. Did he say to look out for anything? Don't know, just said look for a black cab. A black cab. Helpful. And what have we got these passports for, anyway? We're in carwash. Rizla, you begged me to bring you here. I brought you here. Calm yourself. Thank you. HORN BEEPS Right, here we go. Don't talk or anything, yeah? - Bring your passport? - Where we going? France or some shit? Not you. Him. What, he's going to France and I'm not? No-one's going to France. Raza, get in the car. He in't going nowhere with you. You're rude, man. What's the passports for? You want to play with your friend or you want to make money? It's both of us or it's neither of us. Yo! Oi! - Rizla! Bruv, what are you doing? - Sorry, bruv, I need the work. Rizla! Rizla! Whoa, whoa! What's wrong with you?! Whoa, easy, bruv. Hey, what's he doing? I don't have nothing. There's nothing in there. Bruv, what is he doing? That's my phone, that's my phone. Hey! Hey, hey, look, there's nothing on there, yeah? What you doing? Bruv, that's my fucking phone! No-one's calling you today. We buy you a better one. SOFT FLUTE MUSIC PLAYS So, what are we doing anyway? Do you know what is hawala? What, like, them dodgy banks? Yeah, my mum uses them to send eidi back to Pakistan. Today you're going to send a lot of eidis. We go to the hawala, I give you the money and number, you go inside, make a deposit. Can you do it, Chessmaster? HE HUMS Looking for a phone? I've got Samsung, iPhone refurbs. Better than brand-new. I need to send some money. Let me put on my hawala hat. Domestic or international? Uh... Here. International? Right, I'm going to need to see your passport. How much we sending? Um, I actually forgot. Anything over 1,000 has to go through compliance. Well, look at that, £999. Echo one. Stay with the subject. We'll wait with the UC. - OVER RADIO: Roger that. See you in a few. Echo one to kilo one, you're clear. Find out what denomination the source's deposit was in. My dear, this isn't HSBC. Hawalas are very secretive. They don't give up information easily. Kilo one - just buy something. What do you think that will achieve? It gets you a look in the cash register. It'll be the notes on top. Subject leaving the premises. I'm eyes on. Subject making the transfer now. Let's get a background on Almaz Electronics. Hotel one, we have the money ready for pick-up. Echo one, heading east on Hackney Road. - Subject pulling over. - Yeah, roger that. So, what, they got hawala in here? No, they have good kebabs. GABE: Hey, is your waitress on her shift today? Two chicken doners and one mixed grill. Oh, I'm so sorry! WHISPERS: Follow me. - It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. - Really need to... Yeah, you need fizzy water, for your shirt. - Come, I will do it for you. - Hey...! Where are you going? I really need to clean his shirt. What, you want me smelling like kebab all day? HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE - Come in here. - Don't I know you? You were Yousef's girl, right? At the funeral? - Yo, Raza, Assalaamu Alaikum, bruv. - Wa-alaikum salaam. How you doing? Yeah, good. What you doing in here? I'm just grabbing a bite to eat, man. Look, don't worry about them, darling. Just keep your eyes on the girl. Your handler sent me. So they got you running around hawalas all day, have they? How many more drops? - Are you a cop? - I don't know. Are you a snitch? How many more deposits? - I don't know. A bunch. - Hazard a guess. What, say, 50? - Yeah, about that. - OK. 20s. You put one of those into each deposit, you swap like-for-like. The amount doesn't change - 999 every time. - Raza, let's go. - Easy, bruv. It was good to see you, yeah? Take care. Next time get it in your mouth. - One sec, it's nearly out. - I buy you a new shirt. - No, bruv, I like this one. - No, you like her touching you. But she's spoken for. You're going to have beautiful child. HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE - It's a boy. - Oh. You already know. Amazing what these doctors can do now. Let's go, Raza. Right, just one sec. OTHERS SPEAK OWN LANGUAGE - Is that...Yousef's? - Don't forget your money. How's he getting on? Well, how to put this, um... The boy is shitting himself. I suppose touching cloth's the name of the game. Echo one. They're on the move. Echo one. You stay with him. - We're taking kilo one back to the station. - Foxtrot one. We're eyes on. BELL RINGS Have some shame, sisters. No-one wants to be seeing all that. - Weirdo! - Whatever! You'll know about it. - What's up, bro? - What you saying, bruv? This lady called me, yeah? They've put one out by QuickFit. We have got to replace the crank shaft, innit? Let's go. - Nasy! - What you doing here? I finished work early. I was talking to your form teacher. - What you doing that for? - Checking up on my son. Actually, she said you're not doing so bad, so I thought I'd treat you to see a film. Can't, got to fix this crank shaft. Hey, your mum's asked you to the cinema, that's where you've got to go. You better introduce me to your friend. Hello. Akash. Me and Kash got some work to do. - Well, why don't you join us? - I can't be going to the cinema. All the dancing girls, it's haram, innit? Right, this crankshaft ain't going to find itself. In a bit. Akash seems quite a character. How old is he? What's that matter? He's my mate. Tell your mate it isn't the dancing girls that'll kill him, it'll be the bloody cigarettes. - I hope you're not smoking. - Akash is old enough to smoke. I'm not trying to stop him. Well, you should invite him over for dinner, maybe. - Dinner? With you? - Oh, you're embarrassed of me? Ha! I'm way cooler than you, sunshine. Last one, Chessmaster. OTHER MAN SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE Let's go. Be quick. I want a deposit. OK. Raza Shar. HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE You play backgammon? Or only chess? I don't really even play chess, Mr Gramos. This game, you roll high, it's easy to win. You roll low, it's easy to lose. But luck only lasts so long. In the end, you need strategy. Your friend, Dadir, I know what he wants. But he has no strategy. He's going to lose. But you, you have strategy. But I don't know what you want. Why are you playing the game, Raza? It's not really a choice, is it? Just trying to make it through the days. It's been a long day. Go home. What about the last deposit? It is for you. PHONE RINGS RECORDED VOICE: This is Redwood Virtual office, Orlando. - We have a message for... - Charlie Goodman. SHARON: Charlie, I'm so sorry. It's Nigel. They... They found him. And, well... Well, there was nothing I could do. - I'm so sorry, sweetheart. - CALL ENDS _ - Do you want a cup of tea? - Lovely, thank you. Lori, look who's here. - Oh, good morning, Auntie Rose. - Don't mind me, precious one. - The house is coming along. - Slow and steady. Gabe's still asleep. Didn't get in till late. Thought he could use a lie-in. Thanks for letting me borrow him. More like the other way around, isn't it? - Do I let him know you're here? - No, don't bother. I'll take it up. Sure. You know where he is. KNOCK AT DOOR Hey, hello. What was the name of that dog you had? Ruby? Remember how upset you were when I told you you had to give her up? Yeah, well, you were right. I could hardly go undercover plastered in dog hair. The less they know... Anyway, it worked out in the end. I found him a good home. No, Gabriel, you didn't. I saw you walking her once. About two years after you told me you gave her up. Four in the morning, I remember. I was driving home from an all-nighter. I thought about mowing you and bloody Ruby down. Then it struck me - for two years, you must have walked her every morning before sun up, picked every tuft of hair off your uniform. I'd been in that little flat you had. Not a stray bone, tennis ball, nothing. I still can't wrap my head around where you hid the bitch. So, instead of hitting you with my Volvo, I went home and wrote a recommendation for you to level one. If you could hide that dog from me, you could hide anything from anybody. I built her a kennel on the fire escape. Nigel Briggs passed away. Nige? How did that happen? Overdose. I thought it better you hear it from me. That's so weird. I ran into him the other day. He looked clean. You didn't mention that in your duty state. I didn't want to worry you. I'm paid to worry. You're paid to lie. But not to me. Yes, guv. They're not your friends. CLOCK WHIRS AND BLEEPS MAN: See you tomorrow! - The fuck you doing, man? - Shut up, Rizla! Where you going? - To the shop. - Shit, not now, you're not. You're taking me to Gramos. Thanks to you, they've shut me out. I thought it was better one of us take the work. We can split the money, no worries. I don't want that prick's money, Rizla. That man killed Yousef. Igli killed Yousef? Why else you think I'm trying to get close to them Albanians? Except you keep kamikaze-ing my moves, don't you? Bruv, I thought... I just thought you were a dealer. Do I look like some roadman to you?! Rizla! Oh, my days! Like, when we met you got busted for dealing. Wasn't dealing, I was on a night out, sharking, like you. Shit! Sorry, Bruv. I don't want your fucking sorry. Take me to Gramos. What are you going to do? What you think I'm going to do? Huh? Bruv, that's a bad idea, right there. Rizla, I'm not here for your dead input, a'ight? You need to start walking, now. Bruv, he's legit. He'll be ready for you. You're either helping him, or you're helping me, Rizla, which one is it? I think I know where we can go. - OK. - But you need to trust, definitely not be waving that around. Come on. What are we doing? Igli Gramos is not going to be coming into here. Hey. Can I take your order? Why are you bringing me to her? What's wrong with you? Champagne, please. Three glasses. You have one more joining you? - Yeah, you. - Come, sit down, join us. - I can't. - Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea. Why can't you drink with us? Because I'm at work. Tell him why you can't drink. And I'm pregnant. La de da! Name in the hat for the dad, is it? Yeah. Yousef? Yeah. You're going to be an uncle. HE WHOOPS LOUDLY SILENCE I'm going to be an uncle! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING DADIR LAUGHS Are you serious? I've just waved Laurie off. I know, I'm sorry. This is a tired routine, isn't it? When the bat signal goes off, there's nothing I can say about it. You could say, "Sorry, mister terrorist, "my wife cleared her whole weekend, she even bought a new top. "Now she's going to look fucking fantastic all by herself." Well, that's not going to work, is it? Eh? You always look fantastic. Oh, God! Ems... I'll be back as quick as I can. Oh, take your time. Mum won't want to give her back. I'm going to get drunk. Don't! Gabe? No, Gabe's out. You just missed him, I'm afraid. Have you tried him on his mobile? Me? Just this and that. To yours? Yeah, why don't we do that. _ Have you just got these developed? Don't bother with those. Probably shit. No, they're pretty skilled when they're not blurry. The lens has got no autofocus. Have to eyeball it. No way. - What is it? - I know this one. Did she come visit you, too? Yeah, she was on about Raza getting molested. What you talking about, bro? No-one got molested. She's a cop. Yo. Food's ready. Raza, remember that ex-girlfriend you was on about? The one that scared the shit out of Ummi. Was she a cop? What? Give me that. No, she's not a cop. She didn't even work at the school. Well, she came to my house with another cop, trying to recruit me. I told her, "No way. I don't snitch." Oh, that right, Kash? Are they the same cops that watch you jerk off through your TV? - Forget about her. - Don't worry about that. - He's like a dick all the time now. - Dinner's ready! Come on! - Are you hungry? - I can't be eating at your table. - What do you mean? - I don't break bread with kuffars. What? Your dad is always drinking. Raza is like a straight up roadman. Everyone knows it in Bridgetown. And that woman, pretending to be your mum, living with three unmarried men. That's a whore, bro. Don't take it personal. She's not even your family. Later, yeah? Goodnight, Mrs Shar. I thought you were staying to eat with us. I was going to interrogate you. My nan needs me back. Thanks, anyway. OK. Bye. Nas shouldn't be hanging out with him. He's got funny ideas. - Nasir, your food's getting cold. - I'm not hungry. I didn't ask if you were bloody hungry. What's going on with you, huh? When are we going to meet this girl you're seeing? Never. She dumped me. I can't see why. You're so charming. LOCK BLEEPS I was surprised you weren't on call with Gabe today. Some assets he runs alone. He likes to keep me in the dark. You're sure you don't mind? No, at least you open the window. My sister smokes in bed sometimes. The sad thing is, when I get home, I will sneak in the back, throw my clothes in the laundry, shower, mouthwash, then I will douse my hands in vinegar. The lengths we go to lie to the ones we love. But he still knows you smoke. Are you asking me why do I fucking bother? I don't know. Sometimes I think, "Why does he get to hoard all the truth?" Don't you mind how much he keeps from you? I would, but for my sins, I married him. Am I the only one that's drinking? Hey, Holls, do we have anything to eat? I need sustenance. Hey, Holl's friend. Emily, this is my sister, Megan. What are you guys up to? Your sister's interrogating me. - I can imagine. What about? - My husband. Be careful. I used to call her the bloodhound. One sniff, and she'd bark you out of the tree. - She's exaggerating. - Definitely not. What was it? The miles on dad's car? If you're hungry, there are some leftover noodles in the... Wait. What's this about miles on the car? Our dad... I'm telling it now! Our dad had an affair on Mum for, literally, most of our childhood. He went all in - two phones, two bank accounts, PO box. Sophisticated, but he wasn't counting on the bloodhound. 11 years old, Holly sniffed him out. 11? It wasn't complicated. The miles on his car didn't make sense. His office was only down the street. Jesus. How did you tell your mum? We didn't. Megan didn't think it was a good idea. To be fair, I was only 15. I thought she was better off not knowing. - What, she still doesn't know? - She found out. When he left her, six years later. Six years didn't change the truth, what did it matter? You said noodles. All right. I'm out again. Stay in the tree, Holly's friend. - Sorry about her. - No. At least I know now why you invited me over. You don't think my husband's at work, do you? No. Do you? Do you think he's having an affair? Is that what you're afraid of? No. What I'm afraid of is I don't think I know who he is. Who else would he be? I think today he's... ..Charlie. How do you know that name? I overheard it. Some woman on the phone, calling him her Charlie. Recently? The other day. Why? - I don't know what I can say. - Don't do that! I'm not like you. I can't see the miles on the car, and maybe I don't want to fucking see them, I don't know. But whoever Charlie is, I do not want my daughter finding out first. CHATTER FEEDBACK Nigel was dear to many of us. But none among you knew him like this young man. Next up on stage, he's steps across the pond, into our hearts, the master of disaster himself, I give you Mr Charlie Goodman. RAUCOUS CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Cheers, Pat. I know that Nige is up there, watching us. - And he'd want us to have a fucking riot! - CHEERING - So lets give him one! - CHEERING Go on, Pat. PUNK MUSIC PLAYS PHONE RINGS GABE: Post office, leave a message. Bruv, where are you? I've been calling you all night. I'm at the car wash. Gramos is literally about to pick me up. - Your phone. - You just gave me this one. You want him to search you again? Yo. It's late. You making more deposits? Just one. - What the fuck is this? - Get in. What are we doing? No, man, I'm not getting involved in this, man. I'm not getting involved. OPERA MUSIC PLAYS Where are we? Where the hell are we? What are you doing to him? MUFFLED SPEECH FROM HOOD We found your friend under a rock. Gramos, this is mental. What are we doing out here? Your friend is a rat. Snitch? Nah, Dadir's no snitch. Believe me, it's not possible. Someone has been talking to police. If it's not him, tell me who? Huh? His brother is killed, he's angry, he wants to hurt me. Then he starts talking. Now he stops. What is this, bruv? No way! No, no fucking way! You are on the board. You play the game. MUFFLED SOBS Behind ear, he feels nothing. Oh, come on. Come on. This is fucked! No, I'm not doing this. Then kill them both. Wait, wait, wait. Oh! Don't do that. Put your hand down. Put your hand down. Are you going to shoot me? I don't want to shoot anybody. This is not wise strategy. Look, we can all just go home. All we want to do is just go home. No. Only killers can go home. GUN CLICKS LAUGHTER Wow! LAUGHTER OTHERS SPEAK OWN LANGAUGE Next time I see you, the gun will have bullets. We didn't kill your brother. Huh? Luck will only last you for so long. Hey! Your phone. Goodbye, Chessmaster. HE CHUCKLES MUFFLED SPEECH FROM DADIR Rizla! I thought you were going to bury me, brother! I thought you were going to shoot me. Are you laughing? Are you serious? I can't be carrying you, bruv. I've got my own shit. I should have clapped you. What you saying? You all right, yeah? - Rizla? - No, not really. MUSIC PLAYS: December Day by Willie Nelson What you sniffing at? My deodorant run out? No. Well, yeah, but I like it. I know it. Never changes. You could put a blindfold on me, I could sniff you out under water. You'd have to learn to swim first. Shut up! Let me enjoy the moment while I've got you. I never know when I'll get you back again. I thought we ordered pizzas, not bloody curries! - LAUGHTER - Oh, Jesus. I've got a plain, and an Hawaiian for Charlie. Yeah, over here, mate. Here, check that gupta for TNT before he gets too close. LAUGHTER How much is it, mate? Eight, nine quid. Well, what is it, eight or fucking nine? Er... Eight. Do you want me to put it in your pocket for you? - LAUGHTER - Put your pizza down. Take your money. There you go, step by step, we'll get there, won't we? I thought this lot were supposed to be good at maths. LAUGHTER Oi, you forgot your tip. - Don't worry about it. - Come on, you've been a good sport. I don't need your fucking money, bruv. - MAN: Ooooh! - What did he just say? What did you call me? MAN: Shit. The nuts on him. You going to let him walk away like that? SHE WHISPERS: Fucking sort him out. Lock that fucking door! UNDER BREATH: Fucking hell. to love's eager beginning the thoughts of the ending ♪ And this looks like a December day. ♪ - It's clean? - What's clean? We don't know where it's headed, but now know where it's from. - Are you asking me to guess? - Royal Mint. This serial numbers from the hawala deposits came back. No history, never even been in circulation. That doesn't make sense. - It's money-laundering. - The miles don't add up. The money's getting dirty, not clean. Who would do that? LOCK BLEEPS Igli Gramos is her asset. MI6 sending money to Syria to finance... What faction's in favour at the moment? Don't gloat. It's gauche. Why are you getting in our way? Who do you think I'm fighting over there? Say what you will about Igli Gramos, but he's not Daesh. He doesn't go anywhere near my source again, understood? You don't have to worry about Raza. From what I understand, he can handle himself. You know what the problem with counterterror is? We're big and robust, so we look for equal and opposite. And then you have Daesh ordering followers to stab any passer-by on the street. Big... doesn't always mean big. - Are we not going to stop her? - Stop what? El Adoua's got nothing to do with that money. All I heard was that Igli Gramos isn't our big shot. - RAZA EXHALES SHARPLY - One, two. One, two. One, two, three. One, two, three. Add some rolls. There you go. Let's go. Some hooks. - One more of those. - RAZA GRUNTS There you go! There you go! - HE GASPS - Well done. Woo! Getting it all out this morning! You've got to shorten that hook, though. Come in closer, create that talk. All right? Your footwork is getting sloppy in the end, there. - Right, three minutes, every second counts. - TRAINER'S VOICES FADES OUT Wake up! Let's go. You thought you were done? Ready when you are...Big Shot. - Ain't been called that in a while. - When did you hang up your gloves? I know what you're doing here. You're stalling. Come on. Let's go. There you go. And again. There you go. Good man. And again, one more. _ UPTEMPO MUSIC INAUDIBLE
