Why do you like Arlo Prine's music and not mine? I mean, what's he got that I ain't got? Talent. Cody, I am not interested in your music. Well, that's 'cause you never let me play any of my good stuff. Hey.. [guitar music] Cody, write me a song about toxic waste.. ...social injustice or the green house effect and I'll listen to it. [Dana sighs] Piece of cake. Cody, you think that's gonna be easy? No...I just wanted a piece of cake. [laughs] - Hi, Frank. - 'Hello, honey.' - How was your day? - Not so good. I put Floyd in charge of puttin' in that new driveway and he messed it all up. What was wrong with it? It leads to the wrong house. [laughs] - That could be a big problem. - Oh.. Oh, uh, hey, Frank.. Have you heard of a little place out in Mequon called Jake's? - Yeah, it's a bar. - No, no, no. I think it's more like a little club. Carol, the only little club at Jake's is the one the bouncer carries. It's a tough place. It's got a two-fight minimum. [sighs] Oh.. No! Oh, no. I told Dana she could go there Saturday night. Now, Carol, if Dana were my daughter there is no way she'd be going to Jake's. Yeah, we better talk to her about it. Uh, Carol, I don't think this is a wesituation. I think this is more of a yousituation. You see, Dana and I haven't exactly bonded yet. Yeah, you're right, okay, I'll leave you completely out of this. Next time I see her, I'll just lay down the law and tell her she can't go and that's final. I'm so excited about going to Jake's to see Arlo Prine. Mom, can I borrow your silver earrings? Uh, Dana, uh.. Why not? Thanks. I- I meant the next next time. [instrumental music] So anybody doing anything exciting this weekend? I'm going to a quilting bee. Perhaps you didn't hear the question. I'm going to dig for fishing worms in the backyard. - You hate fishing. - But I love worms. Hey, Mark, what about you? You have anything exciting planned? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna stay in all weekend and try to recreate Mendel's experiment with hybrid plants. Get a life. Oh, I have a life. It's just a really dull one. Well, everybody knows I'm going to Jake's to see Arlo Prine. Uh, yeah, uh, D-Dana.. I've been, uh, meaning to, to speak to you about that. You know, um, sometimes when you're a parent you make a decision on the spur of the moment and then later you realize you made that decision before you had all the facts. 'And then in line of this new information' you realize that your original decision-- Mother, what are you tryin' to say? I'm sayin' you can't go to Jake's tonight. - What? - But you can wear my earrings. But y-you already told me that I could go. I made plans! I know, I know, I told you that you could go. But that was last night before bed when I spoke to-- B- buh, C-Carol. To a, to a very good friend of mine.. ...who said that a lot of bad guys hang out there. Was this friend Frank-Frank-bobank? You know, mom, it's one thing for you to marry Frank and ruin yourlife, but now he's ruining mine! In the future, Frank, I would appreciate it if you'd mind your own business! [instrumental music] [upbeat music] I can't believe you're sneaking out. Mom said you couldn't go. No, mom said I could go. Frank's the one who changed her mind. Ooh, this so exciting! [crickets chirping] Ah. Where do you think you're going? - Nowhere. - I bet you're going to Jake's. What makes you say that? Because your friend Bernice is parked around the corner wearing a funny nose and glasses. Oh, she's subtle. Alright, you two. You've gotta keep this quiet. [sniggers] Yeah, sure. Shh! I'll pay you each a dollar. Five or we squeal. I hate you. Hey, you didn't pay me anything. You're blood, they're dirt. Oh.. Codeman, what're you doin'? Hey, J.T., I'm just cleanin' my engine. Oh! Hope you don't mind. I borrowed your toothbrush, dude. I don't mind, it's Karen's. [laughs] Good. Ha-ha. Hey, speakin' of Karen I haven't seen Dana all night. Where is she? Can you keep a secret? Me? Tcha. I got stuff up here so secret I won't even tell myself. Cool. Dana snuck out to see some folk singer at Jake's. No way! Dude, there's some pretty mean dudes hangin' out there. That's no place for Dana. I gotta get up there. Ha-ha, but I'd get there a lot quicker with this. [laughs] [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [blowing kisses] This is Jake's? Why would Arlo Prine be appearing here? I think he's making a comeback. Must not be going very well. Um...excuse me. Can we please have a table for two? Follow me. Um, do you have anything in non-smoking? How's that? Much better. Dana, I think we should go. I have a bad feeling about this place. Come on, Bernice, if we don't bother them they won't bother us. They won't bother me because I'm leaving. Thanks a lot, Bernice. You're my ride. [sighs] You're right. We came together, we're leaving together. There's no way I'm gonna abandon you in a place like this. [bottle shatters] Call me tomorrow. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] - Well, goodnight. - Goodnight, honey. I'm meeting Richie at the movies. Honey, I'm gonna go up and try and talk to Dana. No! Why, why not? Uh.. Because.. ...she's not in the house. She left? No...she didn't leave. She's just...not in the house. She's...on the house. Yeah, she's on the roof. What? See, we were watching TV and the picture went out so she went on the roof to fix the antenna. Told her not do it, but you know Dana. Just shimmied up the drainpipe. Did she go to Jake's? I'm not going to tell. Well, then you're not going out. Then she went to Jake's. We gotta go get her, honey. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] Hey...how you doin', sweet face? My name's Psycho. Hi, I'm...Bernice. Hey, a pretty name for a pretty lady. So...you wanna go with me for a ride on my bike? Gee, Psycho, that's tempting but I don't wanna miss Arlo Prine. Who? The singer. Isn't that why you're here, too? No. I'm here to pick up chicks and bust some heads. Whichever comes first. Mind if I sit down? Um.. Let me buy you a beer. Oh, I didn't realize it was so late. I have to get back to the convent and iron my habit. Well, hey, what's your hurry, sister? I'll tell you what. Why don't we just stay here and dance? No, that's okay, I don't really feel like dancing. Oh. Hey...you're cute. Oh, sorry, I'm taken. - Hi. - Oh! Sorry, I'm taken. Look, Psycho, I don't wanna dance with you. Come on, why not? 'Cause she's with me, dude. That's right, I'm with him. You know, that's too bad because they're with me. [whistles] Hey. [clattering] Whoa! Tch. I sense trouble, ha-ha. Hey, gomer. Do me favor, take a walk while you still can. Oh-ho, I get it. You guys are tryin' to pick a fight. [laughs] Oh, that's too bad. You know, 'cause I really hate fighting. You know, somebody always ends up in the emergency room and.. Then you gotta fill out all those forms and there's the insurance hassles, phew. Hey, we're just gonna cut out all that bureaucracy right here and now, and leave. Oh, you can leave, but she stays. Ow, let go of me! Let go of her, dude. [female #1] 'Whoa.' Shut up. Whoa-ha-ha-ha-oh. That's not cool, dude. [all] Oh. [indistinct chatter] [groaning] That smarts. Don't it, dude? [laughing] Get him! [yells] [grunting] Hi-ya! - Come on. - Dude, that is so cool. [laughs] You know, I bet you I could that, man. [grunting] [crowd cheering] What do you think, dude? Pretty cool. [laughs] [grunting] Here comes the melvin, dude. [groaning] Cody, where did you learn how to do that? Do what? Hey! - I got him, I got him. - Hold on. [grunting] Dude, thanks, bro. - Ha, ha, ha. - 'Get him, Bruce.' [yells] [indistinct chatter] [women screaming] Cody! [male #1] 'Ha-yi-ya.' Ha-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.. Ha-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.. Ha-yi-yi-ya. Ha-yi-yi-ya-ya-hmph! [babbling] [laughs] [grunting] Mop and Glo. Mop and Glo, dude. [glass shatters] No way. Who put a window there, dude? Get him, grab him. Everybody, grab him. No, no, no. No, no. [Cody] Dude! So, wise guy, looks like you're outnumbered now, huh? Yeah, well, the odds just got a little better. [crowd gasping] [groaning] [screaming] [grunting] [grunts] Alright, guys, look. I was only kidding. I was joking.. - Uh-huh. - It was a joke! I didn't mean anything, I swear! Hey, Cody! Looks like I still got it. [laughs] - Hey. - Frank! [grunting] [screams] Carol, that was wonderful. That was Arlo Prine. Dude. Oh! Am I on? [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [laughs] That was a pretty cool night, huh? [chuckles] Well, if anybody wants me I'll be out in my van. Cody. Listen.. Thanks for showing up and protecting me from those goons. Oh, you'd have done the same thing for me. [chuckles] Pretty fancy footwork, Cody. [laughs] I know! I wonder where I learned that. I think I'll go check my diary. Mom, you haven't said a word. I'd feel lot better if you'd say something. You want me to say something? Okay, I'll say something. You are a self-centered, pig-headed brat. You could've gotten yourself killed tonight. In the future, when I tell you not to do something, I mean it. Except for right now there will be no future because you're spending the next six years in your room. Do you feel better? Goodnight. Six years? Oh, your mother's just upset. I'll talk to her. I'll have you out in four. - Thanks, Frank. - You want some ice cream? No, thanks. I'm not very hungry. Rocky road. Kinda like my life. Hey. Dana, live and learn. Look, Frank.. ...I owe you an apology. I should've listened to you. It's just, it's hard for me. I'm not used to having a stepfather. [scoffs] Well, Dana, I am not used to beinga stepfather. In a lot of ways, it's harder than being a father. W- with my own kids, it's black and white. I'm their dad, they have to listen to me. With you...well, there's a lot of grey. [scoffs] There's a ton of grey. It's all grey, it.. It's really a tough job. I guess I don't make it any easier. I know I can be.. ...occasionally...intransigent. Intractable. - A pain in the butt. - Oh, yeah! Well, you are a challenge. Hey, look, Dana I am not trying to run your life. I just wanna be a part of it. I care about you. I appreciate that, Frank. I really do. Thanks. Oh...don't mention it. You sure you don't want any ice cream? No, thanks. I'm going to bed. Okay. You know, Frank, you really throw a mean punch. - Does that hurt your hand? - Heh, nah. Not if you know how to do it. Well, goodnight. Goodnight.
