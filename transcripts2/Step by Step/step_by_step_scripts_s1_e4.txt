 Step by Step (1991â€“1998): Season 1, Episode 4 - First Anniversary - full transcript 
 Frank and J.T. are tickled pink when cousin Cody, the cool demolition natural who lives in bis van, arrives for a weekend visit. J.T. naughtily bets that even he can't charm Barky into a date. Carol is hopelessly and misleadingly unclear about her expectations for the first wedding month-'anniversary'. So Frank simply buys a super-saw in a hardware-sale, but he finds a Jamaica-nostalgic alternative.

He's amazing. Is he right? I'm tellin' ya, there's nothin' I don't know about baseball. In 1913, what pitcher-- Zip Zabel. Goodbye. What do you expect? He's got no life. Honey, I got great news. My nephew Cody's coming this weekend. Yeah, well, that makes two great things that are happening this weekend. Do you know what the other one is? You bet. A big grout sale at the Tile King. Heh. Frank. This Saturday is our one month wedding anniversary. - Remember Jamaica? - Yeah, yeah. - I knew that. - You did not. Hey, what do you do for a one month anniversary? I mean, do we give each other gifts or what? No, no, no, no, that's really not necessary. I mean, we're each other's best present. Yeah, that's right. Can I unwrap mine now? Carol! What is the matter with you? I'm right in the middle of trying to make Helen Puckett a blonde! She's waited 75 years to become a blonde she can wait five more minutes. I just wanna show you what I got Frank for our anniversary. It's gorgeous. I thought you two weren't going to exchange gifts. We just said that. Everybody gives anniversary gifts. I wonder what he got for me. - 'Carol!' - Here he is. - Hide the box. - Hide the box. Hide it. - Hide it. Hide.. - Here. Take it over there. Take this.. - Honey? - Hi, Frank. Penny. Carol, I have to run downtown for a minute. Really? What for? To, pick up a new power saw. A power saw. - Yeah. - Well.. Just make sure you get a nice one. You know what they say, "A power saw is forever." - Bye. - Bye. Power saw. He's so obvious. Let's hide that package. That was such a close call. Hello. Fruit. Ha-ha-ha! Blows me away. Who are you? I'm Cody. I'm Frank's nephew. I live in the van in the driveway. Right. I- I-I'm Carol, Frank's wife. She lives in the house by the driveway. This is my sister, Penny. Sisters! Foxes must run in the family. Thank you. Frank told me to make myself at home so I wanted to run a little power out to my van. Is there an outlet I could use around.. Cool! There's one. Your circuits must be fried. Fried? My gosh! I left Helen Puckett under the dryer. Her head must be a raisin by now. Well, it was nice to meet you, Cody. Ditto. Tsk. Tsk! - Cody! - J.T.! - My man. My pal. My cuz. - My man. My pal. My cuz. What's up, brother? How you doin'? Codeman, aw, you are so cool. You are the coolest guy on the planet. I know. So how's the babe quotient on the road? Pretty intense. Tcha. There are chicks so luminous, it'd make your ears bleed. Aw, man! You really know how to paint a picture. There ain't a chick yet that's been able to resist my personal magnetism. Hey, wait a minute. I know a girl who would never go out with you. My step-sister. Is she breathin'? Ha-ha. I got 20 bucks says she won't go out with you. - Pfft! You're on. - Alright, man. 'Better hope you have the cash.' I got Lucille, the Chick Mobile, brother. Excuse me. Is this the cousin who lives in his car? - Van. - Hi, Van. - Yeah. - His name is Cody. Cody, this is my step-sister, Karen. Hey. You're a model, right? No, I just look like one. Not her. J.T., you accidentally left your jacket in the hallway, so I burned it. Her. Her? Good. I like 'em when they're rude. Glass. Ha-ha. You can see through it. I mean, how.. How do they do that? Okay, here comes Frosty the step-sister. Okay, watch this and marvel. Hello, sweet face. Goodbye, dog brains. Hey, did you ever model? Be still, my lunch. Ha-ha! Hey, yo, Dana. What do you think you wanna do somethin' tonight? Yeah, I'd like to do something but it's a felony. No, I mean, go out. You know, like, on a date. Out? On a date? With you? So what night would be good for you? Cody, she really shot you down. - You owe me 20 bucks. - No, no. I got her right where I want her. Hey, and remember, she who laughs in my face ends up in my embrace? You are totally amazing. I know. - Hi, honey. - Hi. Happy anniversary. Surprise. - What's this? - Open it. Carol. It's beautiful, honey. But you shouldn't have. - Well.. - No, really. You shouldn't have. I didn't get you anything. What about that? - My saw? - Come on, Frank. I know it's not a saw. Carol, it's a saw. It's not a saw. It's a saw. Of course, it's a saw. Well, why'd you get me a saw? I, I didn't get you a saw. I got me a saw. You didn't get me anything? You told me you didn't want anything. I did not say I did not want anything. I said it wasn't necessary. You're supposed to know the difference. I'm supposed to read your mind? Well, who do you think I am? Carnac? Well, I wish. Carnac would have gotten me a present. Well, he's retiring next year. - Maybe you can marry him. - Brother. Well, happy anniversary Mr. Sensitivity. Well, same to you, Mrs.. ...Sippi. Sippi? Yo, Dana, I wrote you a tune. I don't wanna hear it. Two, three, four.. Well, that's all I got so far. - Catchy. - Hey. You know what your problem is, Dana? You put me up on this pedestal. You think I'm beyond your reach. But you're wrong, I'm just like this regular incredible guy. Look, I know you want me. So make your move. Cody, let me lay it out for you. If I had a choice between dating you and putting out oil well fires with my tongue I'd be on the next plane to Kuwait. So you want a ride to the airport? You mean he didn't give you anything for your one month anniversary? Doesn't he realize the importance of occasions like this? It'd be like mom forgetting my birthday. When is your birthday? May 11th. No, I don't think so. - Hi, Frank. - Hi, Penny. - Hi. - Hi. Come on, Carol. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the fight the anniversary, about everything. Here. 'Friends?' Well, that's sweet, Frank. Thanks. - I said I was sorry. - And I accept your apology. I mean, it's not your fault that you're not as romanticas I am. I just have to accept the fact that you are who you are. A practical, down to earth kind of guy. Excuse me. Customer. Penny. Penny, what do you think? That rose didn't do it, did it? Good call, Frank. You're in trouble up to your tool belt. Well, what am I gonna do? Well, I was in the same situation once with Harvey Keller. You've gotta do something special. You've gotta do something that says "You drive me crazy. "You are the sexiest person in the world. "I want you, I want you bad. "I want you so bad, I can't stand it. Please, don't leave me!" But did Harvey care? No! He ran off with that waitress from Kenosha! - Just go and run off-- - Penny, Penny. What about me? I've got my own problems. Harvey's still in Kenosha. And my own mother doesn't know my birthday! I just can't believe what a scuzz that Cody is. If we didn't keep the bathroom door closed he'd drink out of the toilet. I think Cody's sort of cute. Well, you go out with him. Maybe then, he'll stop hounding me. He's just doin' it for the money. Money? - What money? - You didn't know? J.T. bet Cody $20 you wouldn't go on a date with him. My weasel step-brother is trying to make money off of my personal life? You make it sound like a bad thing. Alright, alright. Final question. You know the last player to win the Triple Crown? Carl Yastrzemski, 1967. That's not the question. Spell "Yastrzemski." Y- A-S-T-R-Z-E-M-S-K-I. I give up. 'You're the champ.' I have a baseball question. You amuse me. Why do they call it an inning? - An inning? - Yeah. They play outside so why don't they call it an outing? Um.. He doesn't know. We got him, we got him! No! Igot him. I- I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay? - Just a little farther. - Frank. - I am not in the mood for this. - Just be patient, okay? I- I just wanna show you something. Come on. It's right in here. Right here. Okay, now, just stand right here. Okay? Happy anniversary. Frank! It's just like Jamaica. - Do you like it? - I love it. It is just.. ...so romantic. Who did it? - I did. - For me? And watch. Waiter? Look at J.T. He looks just like a little island boy. Can I seat you two now, mon? Yes. Thank you. Island boy? Bring two Jamaican farewells. And something for the lady? Real cute. Scram. Frank. This is.. This is unbelievable. - Does this mean you like it? - I love it. Did you do this because you thought I was hurt? Yeah, absolutely. You think it's easy finding palm trees in Milwaukee? But I told you it wasn't your fault. But you also told me you didn't want a present. Yeah, but that's because I wanted you to think of it yourself without me having to tell you. I mean, to me, that's romantic. To me, that's confusing. Well.. ...I'll try to be clearer from now on. And from now on I'll try to be more romantic. Romantic. Clearer. Hey, look, it's Bomba, The Jungle Boy. How would you like a coconut up your nose? Not so fast, J.T. I wanna tell you about the date I just had. - Why would I care? - Because it was with him. Hey, it's Bomba, The Jungle Boy. You two went out on a date? Yep, we went to a concert. We saw the Brain-Dead Idiots. And I sat next to one. But it was worth it just to see youlose 20 bucks. Go on, pay him the money, J.T. I guess you earned it if you spent more than ten minutes with Vampira. J.T., man, I can't take your money, bro. - What? - What? I should be paying you. I mean, tonight was cosmic. I'm totally in love. Hey, wait a minute. Dana, that lyric just came to me. I gotta write that down. Excuse me, I feel an embolism coming on. Dana, wait, there's more. Listen. Lock the door!
