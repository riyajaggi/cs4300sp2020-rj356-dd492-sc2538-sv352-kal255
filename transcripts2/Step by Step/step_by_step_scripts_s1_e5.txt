 Step by Step (1991â€“1998): Season 1, Episode 5 - Frank & Son - full transcript 
 J.T., who needs extra money, agrees to work for Frank. Frank is thrilled though J.T. does not feel the same way. After failing horribly there, J.T. works for Carol as a shampoo boy. The only good thing about working as a shampoo boy is that J.T. can touch girls and not get in trouble. Dana needs to build a birdhouse and Al has to write a report on Tom Sawyer. To get decent grades, they switch assignments. Eventually, Brendan points out that it is cheating. After seeing Al's birdhouse, Frank and Al end up talking about construction.

 Hey, Dana, what are you workin' on? Believe me, J.T., you wouldn't be interested. Fine. I try to show a little interest in my new family and you shut me down. I'm hurt. Okay. These are some sketches for a bird house I'm making for wood shop class. If I don't ace this project, it's gonna bring down my whole grade point average.

 You're right, Dana. I'm not interested. I can't believe it. Why does this always happen to me? What's wrong? You know the sophomore dance that everybody is going to? Don't tell me, no one's asked you? Get real, rat face. Everyone'sasked me! The problem is, I can't decide who to go with. Dana, what am I gonna do? Karen, I think I've got it. I knew I could count on you. Listen very carefully.

 I want you to go upstairs.. Yeah, and? That's it, just go upstairs. Well, thanks a lot. Next time you have a crisis, don't come to me. No! Who am I gonna turn to now? Hi, guys. Hey, is anyone using the VCR? What video did you rent? - It's 'Tom Sawyer.' - Who? I have to do a stupid book report. You're doing a book report so you rented the movie? You people have the worststudy habits. Insult our manners criticize our clothes but please.. Please. Don't put down our study habits! - Hi, honey. - Hi, sweetheart. What a day. Yeah, I know what you mean. Do you know what kept me goin'? The thought of you and I going to bed early and going to sleep late. Sounds great. I just wish I was gonna be there for it. - Excuse me? - Honey, I am exhausted. The only thing I want tonight is a hot bath. Well. We haven't done that since Jamaica. I mean by myself. Can I watch? No, but if you're real good I'll tape it for you. Hey, dad, just the man I wanna see. Can I borrow 20 bucks? J.T., I gave you your allowance yesterday. How do you go through money so fast? I guess I'm just good at it. Well, if you can't live on your allowance maybe you should get a job. Hey.. Well, why don't you go to work part-time for me? Construction? I don't know, dad, I'm really not that handy. Of course, you are! J.T., first day on the job. I think I'm more excited about this than you are. I guarantee it, dad. Wait until you see what I got for ya. Your own tool belt! Now, check thisout. That's beautiful. Carol, look at him. Now who does he remind you of? One of the village people? Start each day with a laugh, I love it. Come on, son, we're burnin' daylight. It's a good thing he was wearing that hard hat. So, Dana. How's the bird house coming? Almost done. I just have to put the gutters on. Great. So let me see it. What are you laughing at? You have to watch a video to do a book report. I could write a book report on Tom Sawyer in ten minutes. So what? I built a bird house better than that when I was in second grade. You've built a bird house? You've read "Tom Sawyer?" Step into my office. Dad, I don't know how to break it to you but holding a piece of wood all day is boring. You think I could try cutting now? Well, son, I didn't want to rush you too much like I did with the hot glue gun. I'm sorry, dad! Well...that's alright. Tell you what. Let's see if you can cut it. You gotta get used to this, J.T. We construction guys kid like this all the time. - Sorry, dad. - No, no, no, it's my fault. I should have told you, specifically not to cut through your power cord. Okay, let's just.. ...put these tools away, okay? Come on, J.T. We can, put up some drywall, okay? Here we go, this comes up here. Okay, now. I'll start it for you. Okay. - You nail it in. - Okay. Come on, J.T., drive it home. I'll tell you what. Maybe I'm pushing you just a little too fast. Why don't you take this and pull out any loose nails you see in the boards, okay? I think I can do that. I'm countin' on it. JT, this is the life, you know? Working out here in the sunshine. The fresh air. A lot of guys spend their whole lives cooped up in offices. They don't take any pride in what they do. Out here you gotta.. ...work with your hands. 'A man can take pride in something like that.' I'm sorry. No, it's impossible today. I am completely booked up with a wedding. Okay. - Hi, Carol. - Hi, J.T. Why aren't you working with your dad? Well, I'm not sure. - But I think my dad fired me. - What'd he say? "Get out of here and never come back." Which part aren't you sure about? Excuse me, Carol, but I think my hair is starting to singe. I'm sorry, Mrs. Radley. I'll get these curlers out right now. Shouldn't you finish combing me out first? Y- yes. Mom, could you just help me? I've only got two hands! Yes, and they are both empty. Never work with family! Carol, you know my daughter's still waiting for her shampoo. Right. Janet. I almost forgot. J.T. JT, would you shampoo Janet for me, please? No way! I don't even like shampooing my hair. - JT, please. Do me a big favor! - No, no. It would save me life. I am so busy-- Carol, Carol. I'm-I'm still waiting for my shampoo. I'm sorry, Janet, I'll be with you as soon-- Janet? You're Janet? Why didn't you tell me Janet was waiting? I'm, J.T. I'll be doing your shampoo today. So then, the bartender says "I was talking to the duck!" Ha ha ha! J.T. If I weren't getting married this afternoon. Here, this is for you. Thanks, Rachel. J.T.. ...you made more money today than I did. Yeah, the way these ladies tip I'll be able to pay back dad for the house I leveled this mornin'. Tips? You get tips? You know, I was thinking how would you like to help me out every Saturday? - Are you serious? - Yeah, I mean. Being as how you're not working with your dad, and good help is sohard to find. - Why not? - Okay, it's a deal. Alright! That crack about good help really hurts. Hi, Frank! Hello, ladies. - J.T. - Hi, dad. I want to apologize for losing my temper this morning. Dad, after everything I did, I don't blame you. No, no, no, no, no the mistakes you made could have happened to anybody. Of course, most other people would have spread them out over a whole lifetime. What do you say we start fresh next Saturday? Gee, dad, thanks. But I can't. I already got another job. - Another job? Where? - Right here. He's working for me, he's my new shampoo boy. Isn't that great? Anybody want some coffee? Shampoo boy? J.T., I'm waiting for those magic fingers I heard so much about. Excuse me, dad, I'm burnin' daylight. Shampoo boy? J.T. is a shampoo boy? And a darn good one, too. You should be proud. Proud? Honey, my son is working in a beauty salon. What if this gets out? What is wrong with working in a beauty salon? - I work in a beauty salon. - Well, yeah. But you're a-a, a woman, and he's a guy and guys are supposed to work with their hands. - He is working with his hands. - No, no. He's working with his fingers! There is a big difference and you would understand it if you were a guy. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. You're married to someone and then you find out you're married to a sexist! I am not a sexist. I just think there are some things men shouldn't do, like work in a beauty salon. - And be a ballet dancer. - Exactly. See, now we're on the same wavelength. Frank, would you wake up and smell the cremerinse? These are the '90s and it's okay for J.T. to work in a beauty salon! No, it's not. If he works in a beauty salon.. ...what happens to Lambert and Son? I see. This is not about J.T., this is about you. Well, Carol, I always thought that he would come into the business with me and we'd work side by side. You know, partners. Frank. That's such a sweet dream. But it's your dream, not his. Yeah, maybe you're right. Aw, are you okay? I'm fine. I could be finer. Hey, Al, great job! Thanks, let's hope you did the same with my book report. I did, and I even misspelled a few words so it still looks like you wrote it. What are you guys doing? We made a deal. She did my homework and, I did hers. Is that allowed? - Yes! - Yes! I always thought that was cheating. Brendan, um.. Someone wants you in the other room. - Who? - Me. Kids, they say the darndest things, don't they? Well.. Thanks for the book report. I can't do this. I can't turn in somebody else's work and neither can you. You wanna bet? Give it to me, give it to me! - I wrote this book report! - Yeah, well, we made a deal! Hi, daddy, want a pickle? No, thanks. Say, Brendan. Let me ask you a question. How would you like to come and work for your daddy? Why? Am I being punished? Hey, hey, hey, girls, girls, girls, girls. Come on now. What's going on here? What are you doing? I was just showing Al the book report I didon Tom Sawyer. Hope it helped. You know, Al, you should listen to Dana. She really has her head on straight. That's only because youinterrupted us! - Hey, dad. - Hello, J.T. Can I talk to you for a second? Well, sure. Listen. Carol told me how important it was to you that we work together so if you're up for it I'm willing to give it another shot. You really hate construction, don't you? Well, not all of it. I liked stoppin' for donuts. Well, at least you're honest with me. Are you gonna be okay if I don't work with you? Yeah, I'll be fine. I know I'll be safer. Hey, you just do whatever you want. If you wanna be a.. ...hairdresser.. ...then go ahead. I don't wanna be a hairdresser. I'm just doin' it because it's an easy way to make some money, and to touch girls without being sent to the principal's office. Hey, Al, nice birdhouse. Thanks, a lot of good it did me. You made this birdhouse? Yeah, but if I had more time I would have dovetailed the edges. Yeah, and maybe done something a little fancier with the routing. I don't know, I think sometimes people go a little overboard with routing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Al, do you know how to use a hot glue gun? Come on, dad, any idiot can use a hot glue gun. That's what I thought, too. Al, what size hard hat do you wear? It's awfully quiet around here. Where is everyone? Well, Brendan's spending the night with a friend and the rest of the kids are at a movie. What time does the movie get out? About an hour. You mean...we're all alone? You want to watch me take a bath?
