[wind howling] [dramatic music] [Alex] Please welcome Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson! I see you. {\an7}All right, let's get this show on the road. Welcome to The Titan Games. Tonight, we've got a police officer, an ICU nurse, and an athlete who recently bounced back {\an7}from a life-threatening illness. Trust me when I say they are ready to bring it. [cheers and applause] Helping me out as always in the Titan Arena, here is my partner in crime, Cari Champion. [dramatic music] -Thank you, DJ. -And now, as always, here in the Titan Arena, the phrase that I love to say, -especially on NBC. -Oh. -Live, from New York, it's... -No, wrong show. Wrong show. -Wrong show. -Yes. -Ah, got it. -Okay. The other phrase I love to say on NBC. Let The Titan Games begin! [dramatic music] [Cari] Kicking things off, this battle is between two survivors. One's a dedicated father who teaches martial arts in his own dojo. The other is an Air National Guardsman who miraculously recovered from a serious illness and is now stronger than ever. [cheers and applause] [soft music] The discipline that drove Jon Brascetta to The Titan Games has been with him since childhood. I grew up watching Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ninja Turtles, and then obviously, like, The Rock. All superheroes, that was ingrained into my childhood. I started training when I was four years old, and I actually failed my first martial arts test to get my yellow belt 'cause I couldn't do jumping jacks. I mean, obviously, that didn't stop me. I got my first black belt in tae kwon do when I was nine. [grunting] I was 22 years old when I opened my martial arts and fitness studio. -Go! -[all scream] -Go! -[all scream] We cater to kids that are three years old all the way up to adults. Our one common goal is that we're here to get better. [all] Best of the best! Martial arts has always been my passion. It has fueled my purpose. But at the end of the day, the people that push me the most are my wife and son. My wife and I met when she was in 6th grade and I was in 7th grade. I was her first kiss. She is my best friend, my partner. I don't know where I'd be without her. My son's going to be one next month. I just want him to know that as long as you respect yourself and others, and believe in yourself... [giggles] [laughter] ...you can do anything that you want. I'm here to show my wife and my students and my son that anything is possible. I will be a Titan. [dramatic music] [Cari] At 5'10", 215 pounds, Air National Guard Staff Sergeant Matt Cable is as rock solid as the nuclear weapons he's in charge of protecting. But five years ago, this former all-state football and wrestling star from Montana was knocked to his knees. I had flulike symptoms. I started sweating. I can't keep my eyes open. I went to the... the doctor, and, you know, I was diagnosed with leukemia. [soft music] A week later, after my first round of chemo, my organs failed, and I went into a coma. [Cari] Matt spent 18 days in the ICU, followed by seven months of intense chemotherapy. Unable to eat solid food, he lost 50 pounds and all of his muscle mass. I had to relearn how to eat. I had to relearn how to walk. There are days where you want to feel bad for yourself and sorry for yourself, but you can give me a fight, and I'll fight back. [dramatic music] ♪ I'm a fighter ♪ ♪ And I rise higher ♪ ♪ I'm a survivor, and I burn brighter ♪ ♪ I'm never giving up ♪ Today, I bench press 425. I dead lift 650, squat about 600. I won't let anything stand in my path. [Cari] Just four years ago, Matt Cable was fighting for his life. Now he's fighting for Titan glory. My first battle was cancer. My second is The Titan Games, and I don't lose any battles. ♪ I'm a fighter ♪ [cheers and applause] Hello, everyone. I'm Liam McHugh, with my partner Alex "Goldenboy" Mendez. And, Alex, Jon Brascetta told us he and Matt met at the tryouts for The Titan Games and became close friends. But tonight, they are bitter rivals. Watch what happens when push comes to shove on the Herculean Pull. DJ wanted to create a challenge where you outleverage {\an7}an opponent you can't even see. {\an7}[Liam] First, you use grip {\an7}strength and upper-body power to unthread two 100-pound silver poles, each longer than a pickup truck. [Alex] Next is a blind tug-of-war with the golden pole, and you can't use the ground for help. [Liam] Whoever can hang on and generate the most force will hit the target and punch their ticket to Mount Olympus. Now, most people know Hercules as an ancient demigod with incredible strength. Well, I know a little something about Hercules, and what made him a hero wasn't just his power. It was his determination in the face of insurmountable odds. Matt, Jon, you beat the odds just to stand in this Titan Arena, but if you want a chance to be a Titan, you need to unleash every last ounce {\an7}of strength and determination. This is your moment. Own it. This is Herculean Pull. [dramatic music] [Liam] They're off and head to opposite sides, Jon in the red, Matt in the blue. Matt, so powerful. Jon is going to have to use that speed right from the start. [Alex] They get the first one at the same time. This is close. [grunts] [Liam] And Matt is through the first two, up to the gold pole, and John beats him there. And that's big, because Matt, you would think, would have the clear strength advantage. [grunting] Here we go. [grunts] [Alex] And Jon going into a horizontal base there. He put all of his back into this. [dramatic music] [grunting] But now this is where the brute strength of Matt Cable could come into play. [grunts] But Jonathan is not letting up. [grunts] [Liam] Matt can squat 600 pounds. He has extreme leg power. [Alex] But Jon's a fifth-degree black belt. He has reflexes, focus, and flexibility. [grunts] Come on. You got it. Get it. [Liam] Matt Cable, five years ago, fighting for his life. Look at him now. [grunting] -[Alex] Whoa! -You got it! He bounced Jon right into the wall. Matt Cable is trying to force the martial artist to submit. Right here, right now, as he is so close. [Liam] But Jon still won't let go. [grunts] [Alex] Matt Cable, he's moving on! Whoo! Whoo! Matt Cable, he's a beast. Get up here. Ah, I love you! That's a long way from the ICU, my friend. [dramatic music] [Alex] This guy is an inspiration to people around the world. [cheers and applause] This showdown was intense. Two friends had to face off in our arena, and neither wanted to give an inch. But in the end, Matt Cable could not be stopped. [Liam] And now both guys are standing by with Cari. You guys have seemed to form a brotherhood. You have a mutual respect for Matt. Tell me about that. I mean, we, uh, met in July in the combine, and we just kind of kept in touch over social media. And then when we got out here, we reconnected, started training together, and it was just, like, this instant connection between us. He's so inspiring, and he was the better man tonight, and he deserves it. Right. That's great. That is amazing. He said it best. Jon said it best. You're so inspiring. You overcame leukemia. You truly are a survivor. One step closer to becoming a Titan. -Congratulations. -Thank you so much. [dramatic music] [Liam] He defeated cancer. His next mission, to conquer Mount Olympus at The Titan Games. [cheers and applause] [dramatic music] It was important to me that The Titan Games wasn't just a boys club. And one of the things that really impressed me so much was the submissions we received from very strong, very incredible women all across America. [cheers and applause] And two of the absolute best are about to battle it out. [Cari] Strength is a key attribute for any aspiring Titan, and Ashley Hawkins has plenty of it. This North Carolina police officer goes hard every day, and for good reason. I work out and train to survive, because being a police officer, I never know when I'm going to have to fight for my life or have to fight for someone else's life. My grandfather was a cop, my Dad was a cop, and I met my husband in the police academy. I feel like, you know, becoming a police officer, it was kind of just in my blood. [Cari] But even with her legacy and after eight years on the job... I've already checked out Spring Garden Street. Ashley still faces doubt. As a law enforcement officer, many times, females can be underestimated. But if you go out there and prove yourself like I have, that you mean business, you're going to get respect for that. I came to The Titan Games to show women that it's okay to be strong. [radio beeping] {\an7}And to prove to myself that {\an7}I'm as strong as I think I am. [Cari] Step one to becoming a Titan is finding the motivation to train. Florida X-ray technician Jenessa Goeman found her fire after a bad breakup. I met someone, and we dated for three years. There was some cheating on his behalf. When we broke up, I just kind of turned that pain into passion. [Cari] Jenessa, who'd been a competitive gymnast growing up, started waking at 5:00 a.m. every day to hit the gym before work, and it paid off. Getting stronger physically helped get me stronger emotionally. I've learned lots of things about myself, dedication, perseverance. I'm always continuing on the journey, no matter how hard it gets. I don't let anything knock me down. I'm going to be the last one standing. I want that title of Titan. {\an7}[Liam] For Jenessa and Ashley, their Titan challenge is like something out of Game of Thrones. Ooh, winter is coming. Here's the Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] This brutal test will challenge all eight muscle groups in your upper body. {\an7}[Liam] You start by swinging the 10-pound hammer against a metal plate, generating upwards of a half a ton of force with every swing {\an7}until it triggers the release of the 350-pound ram. [Alex] From there, it's a test of brute force to see who can break through the massive wooden doors first, pull the victory chain, and claim your spot on Mount Olympus. [Dwayne] This challenge is a monster. Ashley, Jenessa, get ready to bring it. This is Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] [Liam] A pair of powerful women, and they are right into it. {\an7}Ashley in blue picked up that {\an7}hammer and is smashing away. [Alex] The power, Liam! I can't believe that's an X-ray technician. [Liam] Jenessa and Ashley, head-to-head right now, just trying to release that ram. [dramatic music] [grunts] -Yes, yes! -It is down for Ashley. Now you have to harness it. [grunts] This is so hard. [grunts] [Alex] Now Jenessa's ready to throw down. [Liam] Ashley, a cop, you know, when there's chaos around, she's going to be calm. [grunts] [Alex] Jenessa is still trying to build momentum. You need more than just the backswing. You have to follow through to drive that 350-pound ram into the gate. [Liam] You know you're gassed. You know you're tired. You also know you are so close to that victory chain. [Alex] And a big hit for Ashley. [grunts] And Jenessa's still not getting enough power. [Liam] Ashley's throwing her entire body into every swing. -[Liam] Ashley is through! -Racing to the victory chain. [Alex] Officer Hawkins has it! [screams] Let's go pass out. [Liam] Ashley Hawkins, one tough cop. To protect, to serve, to dominate. [Liam] So Ashley Hawkins goes from the hills of North Carolina to compete on Mount Olympus and take her shot at becoming a Titan. [dramatic music] Success in these games is about keeping a steady stride and not getting too confident too early. It's also about scaring your opponent with a very intimidating face right before you battle. Now, I usually go with something like this. [dramatic music] [heavy rock music] It's time for another battle. [ding] All right, DJ, this is who I got for you. It's a battle between two loving dads who have followed their passions their whole lives. One's a former football player turned yogi master. The other is a successful barber who's now pursuing his goal of being a Titan. Angel Villegas has always been competitive. As a kid in Florida, he was a sponsored skateboarder. Then, he traded in his board to enter the cutthroat world of competitive hair cutting. I took home six first-place trophies, and from there, I just... I just fell in love with it. I was 23 years old when I first opened my barbershop, and I was literally broke the night of my grand opening, but it was, like, the best feeling in the world. It's been five years now, and I currently own three. But I am a self-made man, and I'm very prideful of the fact that I did it all on my own. Day-to-day, my plate's pretty full. You know, I have a fiancée. I have a son at home. [babbles] I have 27 employees, and I still make it to the gym. I'm definitely a big fan of Dwayne Johnson. As a kid growing up, we used to watch him on WWE. The eyebrow, we used to do it. But I could never do the right. I'd just always do the left. I want to be on Dwayne's team, because I feel I'm worthy. I feel I'm ready. I've had to put in a lot of hard work to get to where I am. I'm ready for whatever Dwayne throws at me. [Cari] Former NFL wide receiver DJ Townsel spent years slamming into linebackers and using his body as a weapon. But since he retired, he's opted for a less violent line of work. [soft music] Starting yoga, I was fresh off the football field, and I was stiff as a board. I don't think people look at yogis as top athletes until they step foot into a yoga class and realize how much strength, how much focus it takes. So I fell in love with the... the spiritual and mental side pretty quickly. [Cari] The tranquility DJ achieves through yoga helps him balance his busy life as a single dad. No, you got to hold my ankles. I have a daughter. Her name is Payton. She's nine. I call her my dove, because that's where I found peace and hope. She keeps me on my toes and helps me stay good at math. [laughs] And she forces me to be a better version of myself every day. [Cari] Only 5'10" and 180 pounds, DJ is one of our lighter competitors, but he's at peace with the challenge. I'm not what you would think of when you see yoga, when you see an NFL player. I surprise people when I say both of those things. So I'm always underestimated, and I love it. I come with everything... resilience, athleticism, speed, strength, flexibility, focus. Now I want to bring that to this competition and become a Titan. [Liam] DJ and Angel don't mind hard work, so we're going to let them do some of the heavy lifting for this next challenge. [Alex] Liam, I think it's time to break out the toaster, because their arms are about to turn to jelly on the Vortex. [dramatic music] For the Vortex, you first have to lift the apparatus you're about to climb, a 25-foot chain tower. [Liam] The key is to find a fluid motion that efficiently transfers energy from your legs to your upper body. Then, with whatever strength you have left in those aching arms, you have to climb all the way to the top. {\an7}[Alex] First one to climb up and pull the victory chain is headed to Mount Olympus. When people ask me what exactly does it mean to be a Titan, well, it means a desire to climb higher, to push through your limits and to reach a next level you didn't know existed. So, DJ and Angel, what does it mean to you to be a Titan? Well, myself and the world, we're about to find out. This is Vortex. [dramatic music] {\an7}[Liam] DJ Townsel in the red, Angel Villegas in the blue. Use that adrenaline rush, and crank the chains. The faster you pull, the faster the tower goes up. Then you can climb. Push, push, push! [Alex] These two guys are so evenly matched. And remember, the muscles they're blasting right now are the same ones they'll need fresh to climb. [grunts] Wow. Let's go, boys! [Liam] That endurance is gonna be a factor, because as you're pulling those chains, you're watching that chain tower rise 25 feet into the air. [grunts] [Alex] And you're pulling the chains back horizontally, which means your body weight can't help you at all. [grunts] Both gates are dropped! It's dead even, and time to climb. [Liam] They're up on the chain tower trying to make their way, but you gotta think it through here. You could go straight up, but those chains are looser, and hard to hold. Or you follow the solid golden rods and take the longer route. [Alex] And that's what DJ's doing. He's using the solid bars. But Angel is struggling with those looser chains. -Get on the bars! -Angel, use the bars! Get on the metal bars. [Liam] Listen, it would be tough if they just had to climb this thing, but raising those towers just shredded every muscle they desperately need right now. [Alex] DJ's looking strong. Clearly yoga works. But Angel, still stuck at the bottom. He just has nothing left in those arms. Come on. Don't quit. Don't quit! [Liam] And you look at DJ Townsel. You were wondering, the flexibility, the balance of yoga. how would that come into play? You don't have to wonder anymore. He's right near the top. [Alex] A master yogi now looking to master Mount Olympus. DJ Townsel is your winner. [Liam] So it'll be DJ Townsel's spiritual power versus Matt Cable's {\an7}brute force on Mount Olympus, {\an7}and the winner will keep going in this competition for a chance to become our Titan Champion. Oh, my God. That thing hurt. [dramatic music] [Alex] Welcome back to The Titan Games. [Liam] We have room for one more to compete on Mount Olympus. Let's head down to Cari for the next matchup. In this battle, it's a nursing student who wants to be as healthy as possible for her young daughter versus an ICU nurse who pushes herself to the limit to inspire her patients. [dramatic music] [Cari] Lauren Regno, a nursing student in Modesto, California, is fascinated by fitness. ♪ Break it to the ground ♪ But her true passion is being a mom. I have a five-, almost six-year-old going on 16. Her name's Sophia. She's my world. I would give everything for her. I want to show my daughter that you can go to the gym, you can work out, you can look good, but you can also have a career. There's no reason you can't do it all. [bright music] [rock music] [Cari] Alma Dwumfour's vital work inside the ICU at Connecticut's Norwalk Hospital taught her one important lesson. Each day could be your last. Every one of my patients has, like, a little piece of my heart. It's just impossible to not get emotionally attached to somebody, especially as you're saving their life. And it inspires me to do whatever I want to do with my healthy body right now, because I have patients that aren't able to do so. [Cari] It doesn't hurt that she also found the perfect training partner. My husband and I are huge fitness people. We just got married less than a month ago. Even on our honeymoon, we would make up all these different fitness activities so we can both stay in shape. He has been my number one supporter over the last nine years. The Titan Games is about pushing your body to its absolute limit, and that's what I'm going to do. [bright music] [Liam] Alma's husband Trent in the stands tonight. [Alex] They've only been married three weeks. Now the honeymoon continues here in the Titan Arena. [Liam] And there's Lauren's family, {\an7}including her daughter Sofia. And both these ladies will need all the support they can get, because this next challenge is going to push our competitors to the edge of exhaustion, and then it's going to keep on going. We're going Off the Rails. [dramatic music] {\an7}On this long, painful trip down the wrong side of the tracks, you must first pull yourself and a 200-pound sled along a 60-foot rail, collecting 50-pound beams along the way. [Liam] By the end, you'll be pulling 600 pounds. To get back, you'll need precision and coordination {\an7}to hook the anchor, and reel {\an7}yourself to the victory chain. Alma and Lauren, {\an7}at some point this challenge, your body's going to tell you to quit. {\an7}You got to fight through that, unlock your power, and keep pushing through. This is Off the Rails. [dramatic music] [Liam] Lauren in the red, Alma in the blue. They are up on their sleds. Those sleds weigh 200... -Oh! -Wow, Alma goes down. {\an7}[Liam] Got to keep your balance. Come on. Come on. Come on. come on. [dramatic music] [Alex] We're seeing two different strategies. Look at Lauren here. She's lying back, bracing with her feet on the rail. Then you have Alma crouching, using her knees to keep pushing forward. And she has the lead, coming to the end of the line. I've gotta hand it to Alma. Eight days ago, she was on her honeymoon in Greece. Now she's on the Titan express. Yes! Now you have to throw that hook like an anchor, and pull yourself forward. Alma misses her first throw. Now Lauren's all caught up. Hurry, get up! Get up! [Liam] If they want to get back to that victory chain, they need to toss that hook and pull. [Alex] It's about the strategy, and it's also about aim. That was an ambitious throw from Lauren. Oh! [Liam] Here's the thing. A long toss is risky. If your hook doesn't catch, you have to reel it all the way back and try again. Shorter throws give you more control over the hook. Alma, the ICU nurse, inching her way down the track. It's not just raw strength here. You need that hand-eye coordination. [Alex] Alma is going for the shorter throw and the shorter pulls. Lauren has to catch up. [grunts] Does she get the hook on it? Yes, she does get the hook. She needs a couple more long throws like that to catch up with Alma. [Liam] Alma has the lead. If she can maintain it, she's headed to Mount Olympus. That's my superwoman. [Alex] Lauren is getting low and just using her leverage to try and pull that platform forward. [grunts] Come on! Keep going! But Alma just has to nail this next throw. And she does it! The wall is right in front of her. Alma kicks down the gate, one last rush. [Liam] Train's at the station. Next stop, victory! [Alex] Alma Dwumfour is your winner! {\an7}She is going to Mount Olympus. [Alma] Come on, Lauren! {\an7}[Liam] Lauren's not giving up. She wants to finish. -Come on! -And, Goldenboy, here is more of that Titan spirit that we've seen throughout this competition. Keep going! Kick it! Yes! [dramatic music] It's what we do on The Titan Games. We finish what we start. [grunts] You did it, baby. Did so good, so good. -I love you. -I love you. You did so good. There's a lot of kissing going on over there. [Alex] They are definitely newlyweds. Well, if Alma can break away from her husband, she'll be moving on to face North Carolina cop Ashley Hawkins on Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] The time has come for tonight's winners to go head-to-head on the mountain of madness. The funhouse of physicality, Mount Olympus. It's truly the ultimate battleground. Now, Ashley Hawkins, a cop, and Alma Dwumfour, a nurse, have professions that would normally work in unison, but tonight, they're battling it out. [dramatic music] Having a career in law enforcement, you have to always be prepared for the unknown. [Liam] Look at Ashley, bashing away. That's how I'm going to conquer Mount Olympus. -[Alex] So much power! -I'm just ready for anything. My edge going into Mount Olympus is my determination. [Liam] The ICU nurse, inching her way closer. -There we go. -It feels incredible to have my husband here to support me. He inspires me every day. He makes me feel like I can achieve anything. In order to become a Titan, you have to let everything all out there, so I can't hold anything back tonight for sure. All right, we all have struggles that shape us, but it's moments like this that define us. Can you keep going when the climb is steep and the floor below you is unsteady? Ashley, Alma, you're already inspiring all those around you. You've inspired millions tonight. Now, with the world watching, it's time to unleash your awesome power. This is Mount Olympus! [dramatic music] [Liam] Alma in the blue. Ashley in the red. 1,000-pound wall. Think about pushing a grand piano. [Alex] Got to use your momentum here. And Ashley shoves it over first! Alma, getting it rocking, and done. {\an7}Time for the Gates of Olympus. [Liam] Both ladies driving uphill. Each gate 150 pounds. [grunts] And Ashley has the early lead. [Alex] And for Ashley, you always have to be concerned about the Rolling Ascent, because it's tricky. It can catch you off-guard, just as you're seeing right there. Come on, Ash! Alma Dwumfour now making her way up the Rolling Ascent, trying to catch up with a stumbling Ashley Hawkins. Once you lose your momentum on these rollers, it can be a hard thing to get back. [grunts] Let's go, Ashley. And Alma Dwumfour on a roll, looking to take the lead. [grunts] -Oh, she goes down hard! -Come on. Get up! Get up! [dramatic music] [Liam] Ashley's over and heading to The Cliffs. Whoo! Come on, Ash! There's no nightstick for this cop. She'll need to punch and kick her own holes to climb 12 feet up. [Alex] And Ashley is looking pretty good. Alma, still struggling on the Rolling Ascent. -Oh! -Oh! And all that energy that she's expending here -is really going to cost her. -Let's go, Alma. [grunts] [Liam] Ashley, meanwhile, up top of Mount Olympus, where she'll attempt to raise that 600-pound torch. [Alex] This is a woman who can squat 275 pounds. She should do well here. [grunts] -[Liam] And here comes Alma. -Yes! Does she have anything left after her struggle up the Rolling Ascent? Alma Dwumfour, just trying to catch up, but she's slowing down. Now get up there. [grunts] [Alex] Now Ashley Hawkins is looking gassed. Crank it, Ashley. [Liam] Oh, those last few cranks are always the hardest. [Alex] Officer Hawkins fires it up! [Liam] And now she makes her descent. Aggressive going down, and then you have to get over those walls, five feet, then six feet, then seven feet. -Yes, yes! -Whoo! Whoo! [Liam] Meanwhile, on the other side, Alma Dwumfour. She's an ICU nurse. You know she won't crumble when the pressure's on. There you go. There you go. [Liam] If she can quickly raise this torch, she still has a shot. Let's go! Let's go! [grunts] [Liam] Ashley is not in the clear just yet. She's on the arena floor, but now has to face the 200-pound ball and chain. We've seen it before, athletes stopped in their tracks. It can make or break their run. Don't quit! Don't quit! [Alex] Ashley Hawkins is taking a breather. And Alma Dwumfour raises that torch! Yes! She has to fly down Mount Olympus A.S.A.P., because Ashley Hawkins is powering across the arena floor, closing in on the Titan tomb. Time for Ashley to get cracking. -There you go! -Put some muscle in it now! [Liam] She's right at the end. Victory is in sight. [Alex] And Alma Dwumfour is soaring down The Descent, hoping for a miracle. [Liam] What does Ashley have left? A third-generation cop from North Carolina, she wants to be first in her family to achieve the rank of Titan. [Alex] And Alma Dwumfour has one wall to go, but can she find the strength? Finish strong, superwoman! [Liam] It's not going to matter. [Alex] Ashley Hawkins has the Titan key! -Yeah! -Whoo! She is going to just walk to the pillar, lock it in, because she knows that she is a cop and a Titan! [dramatic music] -Yes! -Ah! -Okay, oh, God. -Way to go! -So proud of you. -You did awesome. [cheers and applause] You know it's okay. You did it. You did so good. I'm so happy. Here you go. Congratulations. To you and your blue-line family, -thank you for your service. -Thank you. -You did amazing. -You crushed it. Thank you. Thank you. We'll be right back with more Titan Games. Amazing. [dramatic music] Now two powerhouse athletes are about to face off for their shot at Titan glory. They proved what they're capable of earlier tonight. Now the yogi, DJ Townsel, and the Air National Guardsman, Matt Cable, go head-to-head. [dramatic music] Definitely a time when I had leukemia, that I thought that I may not ever be able to do anything like The Titan Games. [Alex] Matt Cable is a tank. I'm so grateful to be alive, and I won't let anything stand in my path. Everybody thinks about yoga, that it's sitting down, stretching in a room full of incense. [Alex] A master yogi is your winner. It takes mind, body, and spirit, and that's everything that I'm going to show out here on Mount Olympus. Everything I have is going to be out there. [Alex] And we take a deep cleansing breath, -and say... -Namaste. Now, these two are more than worthy competitors, but only one of them can be a Titan. DJ, your speed and agility brought you victory tonight. Matt, you showed the world how strong you are. You both lived life by not backing down from anything. This will be no different. As always, it's time to get to work. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Matt in the blue. DJ in the red. DJ with a lot of speed right out the gate. {\an7}[Alex] He's going to need it, {\an7}especially against Matt Cable, who blasts through the 1,000-pound wall. -But DJ's right behind. -Here we go, boys. Matt's 35 pounds heavier, but DJ's pushing ahead on the gates, wow! [Liam] Remember, DJ, he said "I'm overlooked because I'm a yogi, but I have that pro football background." -Look at the speed. -[Alex] Oh, my goodness! He is flying through the Rolling Ascent. Be careful! Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! And he manages to get up there. [Liam] You know what that was? That's a guy who runs a 4.4 40. Already at The Cliffs. [Alex] But Matt Cable, not too far behind. Go, Matt! [Alex] Ah, and the master of calm is losing his cool on that wall, making the holes a little too big. [Liam] And here's Matt Cable stepping up. [grunts] Oh, not gonna be easy getting 215 pounds up that wall. [grunts] [Alex] But DJ Townsel doesn't care about those holes. He just grabs his way up to the top of Mount Olympus. -Let's go! Let's go! -Whoo! [grunts] [dramatic music] [Liam] Raising that torch requires a lot of upper-body strength, and DJ is looking a little gassed after that sprint to the top. [grunts] Let's go, D. [Liam] And Matt Cable makes it to the top. The torch is 600 pounds. Cable can dead lift 650. Let's go, boys! Go, go, go, go! [grunts] [Alex] But DJ Townsel raises the torch. He's still in the lead and ready to race down the mountain. Let's go, D! Let's go! [Liam] But remember, Matt Cable suffered through chemo -and beat leukemia. -Go! Go! There is no way he's quitting now. DJ Townsel, though, is flying down Mount Olympus! [grunts] The Sergeant fires it up! And now, it's a race to the Ball and Chain. -Can Matt make up time? -Go! 250 pounds, it's where the whole race can change. [Liam] And look at DJ Townsel. -One arm! -Love the technique, and love the drive. [Alex] He's doing it with one arm, ladies and gentleman! He doesn't need the left hand. He only needs the right. But here come Matt Cable! [grunts] Matt Cable has to pull this, and look at the strength from Matt Cable! DJ Townsel has to hurry up! Let's go, D! [grunts] [Liam] This is it, right down to the end, tight, tense. [grunts] Can DJ Townsel crack through and find that relic? He's in! He's got it! [Alex] DJ Townsel has the relic in hand! The master yogi looking to become the master Titan! [dramatic music] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! -Whoo! -Wow! What, what, what? Do your thing. [laughs] That was still good work, bro. You were right on him. [Alex] Cable's power was impressive, but he couldn't stand up to DJ's speed. {\an7}Townsel moved up the mountain in a flash and finished with one of the fastest times on Mount Olympus all season. -Here you go, brother. -Appreciate it. -Congratulations, man. -Appreciate it. [Liam] So a master yogi and a North Carolina cop join our Titan team. Next week, it's the fight for the final two spots before they all face off in the Battle of the Titans. Win there, and you're moving on to our Titan Championship. -Yeah, right now. -Let's go right here. -Warrior one. -Warrior one. Warrior one. Bang. -We'll see you next week... -Warrior two. on Titans. Warrior two. -Throw up the U. -Come on, bang. [laughs] [dramatic music]
