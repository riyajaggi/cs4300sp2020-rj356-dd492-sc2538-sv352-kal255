 that drives me, and it drives the incredible people in these Titan Games. Tonight two new never-before-seen insane challenges enter the Titan Arena. [Alex] Oh, my! Look at this! [Dwayne] We're testing power, speed, and most importantly, heart. My Mom is a huge support for me. Go, go, go, Jackie! Go! She's here cheering for me, and it means the world to me. [grunts] Every day, I strive to be like Tyler Lucas 'cause that's someone you want to be like. He's my idol. [Alex] Absolutely incredible! Come on, Kyle! [Dwayne] Tonight we crown two more Titans. ♪ I feel glorious, glorious ♪ I love you! [dramatic music] [Alex] Please welcome Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson! Wow. Welcome to The Titan Games. Thousands of athletes from across the country applied to compete in this very arena, and only the top 64 got the chance. Unbelievably, two of those athletes are brothers with a long sibling rivalry. Now, tonight, they just might get the chance to settle it once and for all. [laughs] To get started, let's bring out my very good buddy, Cari Champion. [dramatic music] Thank you, DJ. Cari, we have arrived at one of my favorite days of the week. -Okay. -Uh, other than leg day, arm day, back day, chest day, groin day... Please don't ask. -Okay. -It is Titan day. So it's time to say it. Let The Titan Games begin! [dramatic music] [Cari] We're kicking things off with two powerful athletes. One is making history and changing minds about women in NASCAR. Can you believe that? Meanwhile, the other is a high school science teacher who found her passion and her purpose in fitness. Let's go! [dramatic music] ♪ Can you feel The beating of the drum? ♪ [Cari] 24-year-old Brehanna Daniels holds a unique place in history. I've used my athleticism to make history, by becoming the first African-American female tire changer in NASCAR. ♪ It's time for war ♪ -[drill whirs] -♪ It's time for battling... ♪ [chief] Brehanna, get ready! I want to see this pit time under two seconds. The car pulls in, I start taking those lug nuts off. [chief] Go, go, go! [Brehanna] The jack man throws a new tire on. -[chief] Move, move, move! -And we're off to the races. [engines roar] I'm paving the way for other people that look like me. I'm just glad I can be the example that you should never limit yourself. [soft music] [Cari] Brehanna's determination comes from the woman she does her best to honor every day. My Mom wanted to make sure I was a strong woman. I lost my mother to breast cancer when I was 14 years old. Times that I feel like giving up, I think about her. [sniffles] She's my superhero. [Cari] Tonight, inspired by her Mom's courage, Brehanna hopes to make her mark in The Titan Games. ♪ To break, to break ♪ I've already honored my Mom by making history. and I want to honor her by becoming a Titan. [cheers and applause] [upbeat music] [Cari] When Gina Policastro's not in the gym, she's in the classroom as an earth science teacher in New York City. Why I picked earth science is because, to me, it's the most relatable. Like, you live on Earth, so you want to know things about it naturally. Fitness was something that I always wanted to do, but I got married in my early 20s, and the person that I was married to was very controlling. Going to the gym wasn't an option. I finally realized I can choose to live this life, or I can choose to live my life, and that's really when my fitness journey started. [Cari] Gina began weightlifting and CrossFit, building the body of a Titan. When I meet my students, the first thing that they're looking at is the size of my arms or my shoulders. The next question I usually get is, like, "Can you beat up someone on the subway?" And I'm, like, "That's not what I do. I do sports." [Cari] Tonight Gina's students get a chance to see her put those muscles to work. I will be a Titan. ♪ Seize the day ♪ [cheers and applause] Hey, everyone. I'm Liam McHugh, here in the skybox as always with Alex "Goldenboy" Mendez. And we are looking at two powerful women who are used to shattering the glass ceiling. This next challenge should be perfect for them. We're about to trigger an Uprising. [dramatic music] [Liam] This is DJ's ultimate challenge for lower body and core strength. [Alex] The goal is to raise a 25-pound anvil {\an7}to the top of a 30-foot tower. {\an7}Standing in your way are five {\an7}six-inch thick solid barriers. Breaking through each slab will require the anvil to be moving at 10 miles per hour. [Liam] If you're the first to bust through, you're moving on to Mount Olympus. These two athletes have broken through many mental and social barriers in their lifetime to achieve great success. Now it's time to break through some physical ones. So, Brehanna, Gina, this is one of the most physically demanding challenges we have, but I personally picked you two for it, because I know what you're capable of. Show the world what you've got. It's time for Uprising. [dramatic music] [Liam] Brehanna in the red. Gina in the blue. The first sprint is on, and Brehanna already blasting through. [Alex] Brehanna managed to get through two of those solid floors. Whoo! Come on, Bre! [dramatic music] [Alex] You can just see the anvil bringing them back. [Liam] It lifted Gina off the ground. [Alex] This is a killer cardio test. Wind sprints with a 25-pound anchor. But you hear the screaming! [Liam] Gina's figured it out, though. She's through two barriers as well. Oh, look at that. Gina gets tripped up in all that rubble. [grunts] [Alex] Every time the anvil hits a level, all your momentum is gone. [Liam] First two are single barriers. The third, it is doubled. And check out how close this is. The ladies are in lockstep right now. Let's go! [Alex] They need to find another gear to break through. [grunting] Oh, and Gina, jumping down. Looking for that little added oomph. Very smart strategy. [Liam] Brehanna pounding her chest. That's her way of connecting with her Mom. [grunting] Wow, let's go! [Liam] On the other side, Gina Policastro. She's a New York City public school teacher. Don't question her toughness. [Alex] Oh, yeah, I was a New York City public school student, so I know what we put our teachers through, Liam. Come on, ladies. Come on. [yells] [Liam] And Gina nearly cracks through that double layer. [Alex] Brehanna... one good push here. She just has to dig deep. [Liam] She's through! Into the single barrier. [yells] [Alex] Now it's going to be two more single barriers. Gina, she's got to go for this right now. This little break that Brehanna's taking, she's got to take advantage, and Gina does it! Oh, man! Now we're back neck and neck here. One of our toughest challenges, and these women are crushing it! [yells] -[Liam] Oh, my God! -[Alex] The dive at the end! Wow! [Alex] That was a smart strategy, to go for the dive! She breaks through all five! [Liam] Brehanna's still got to push forward -to grab that victory chain. -[Alex] Oh, my God! [Liam] She's got it! [Alex] Brehanna Daniels is your winner. Unreal athleticism! [Liam] She made NASCAR history. She is here trying to make Titan history. She is headed to Mount Olympus. [Alex] When Brehanna started slowing down, she tapped into the memory of her Mom. This NASCAR pioneer found a second gear, powered through the last three levels, and pulled the victory chain. Way to leave it out there. Look at this thing. It is incredible, okay? This must be what Kevin Hart sees when he plays on a regular jungle gym. Guys, it's okay. I'm his very good friend. Plus, it's way past his bedtime. He'll never see this anyway. [laughter] Time for the next competition. Hi, Kevin. [dramatic music] [Alex] For the Vortex, you first have to lift the apparatus you're about to climb, a 25-foot chain tower. [Liam] The key is to find a fluid motion {\an7}that efficiently moves energy from your legs to your upper body. Then, with whatever strength you have left in those aching arms, you have to climb all the way to the top. [Alex] First one to pull the victory chain is headed to Mount Olympus. [cheers and applause] [Liam] And we have a unique situation here on The Titan Games tonight. That's Tyler Lucas. He's an Air Force sergeant stationed in Germany. [Alex] And that's his older brother, Kyle. He's not just here to root for Tyler. He's also competing later tonight. {\an7}[Liam] That means if they both win their challenges, we're going to have a battle between brothers on Mount Olympus, and only one can become a Titan. [dramatic music] My brother and I, we're very competitive. He's three years older than me. We would always try to outdo the other to be the most athletic sibling. We never got to wrestle each other, -Oh, that's true. -Which is probably best for Tyler. I'm sure if we wrestled now, it'd be a different outcome. Ooh! As a kid, I followed in his footsteps. Kyle played football at Penn State. A year later, I walked on as a quarterback and a receiver. ♪ We got to live like giants ♪ It was a lot of fun pushing each other and working out together. He is my best friend. ♪ Stand up ♪ [Cari] After college, Tyler and Kyle both joined the Air Force. With Tyler stationed in Germany and Kyle in Colorado Springs, family get-togethers don't happen often. You know I love you. [laughter] [Cari] But their bond remains strong. Not only is this a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but I get to do it with my brother. Man! We never actually competed head-to-head in sports. Now it's finally a chance for us to go head-to-head and settle who is the more athletic brother. [Tyler] I came out here from Germany. I made this trip to compete. I didn't fly 15 hours to come out here to lose. ♪ We live like giants ♪ I will be a Titan. [cheers and applause] [Liam] Oh, man, that matchup would be amazing. But first, Tyler needs to get past a monstrous opponent. [Alex] Julian Stewart is a powerhouse {\an7}who isn't afraid of hard work. [dramatic music] [Cari] Many of our athletes work long hours on demanding jobs. 278-pound Julian Stewart is a security guard, and a real estate agent and a personal trainer, a nutritionist, a youth coach, and a house painter. That's right, six jobs. And he and his wife also have four children. [soft music] It's not easy. There are often days throughout the weeks to where I'm up for 24, 36 hours at a time before I get to actually sleep. Whoo! But at the end of the day, you go home, and you look at your family... -Go! -and that gives me all the... the energy and strength that I need. [grunts] Come on! Let's go, baby! [laughter] I can't get to the gym seven days a week like a lot of guys can, but I love putting the ladder on the back of the house and then climbing up the ladder on the reverse side. And then I have about a 250-pound paint machine that I have to lift. I do whatever it takes. I'm a warrior. I battle. When I put on my super dad cape, it's time to go to work. I'm going to win for myself. I'm going to win for my family. [cheers and applause] [Liam] We have two of the biggest competitors on The Titan Games facing off on the world debut of the Vortex. [Alex] And no surprise, both these guys played football back in college. [Liam] Tyler played at Penn State, Julian at Eastern Washington. Let's throw it to our Miami Hurricane, Dwayne Johnson. Because it is all about the U. Our competitors have been grinding it out for years in the gym and certainly in their everyday lives. So, Tyler, Julian, the world's about to see why I chose you both to be here. This is your moment. This is Vortex. [dramatic music] [Liam] Tyler in the blue. Julian in the red. Attack those chains, and raise the tower. The faster you pull, the faster it rises. -Then, you can climb. -[grunts] [Alex] Yeah, Tyler's staying low with quick pulls. Julian's leaning with longer strokes. He's 278 pounds of raw power. But you got to wonder how he's going to fare when he manages to bring that gate down and start to climb the Vortex. [Liam] You know he's not going to stop working. Father of four, works six jobs to support them. Whoo! Pull, baby! Pull! [Liam] Julian's tower is about halfway up. Tyler needs about ten more feet to the top. [Alex] Look at Tyler's technique. He's getting low so his arms are right in line with the chain. That's a smart move. [Liam] He's bracing with his legs, and that transfers power up through his core to help pull. {\an7}Let's go, Tyler! There we go! [grunts] [Liam] His chain tower is up, and his gate goes down. Now it's time to climb 25 feet up to that victory chain. [grunts] [Alex] And here comes Julian! Here's the problem. The muscles they need to climb are the same ones they just shredded raising the tower. [grunts] Despite the lead that Tyler had, he hasn't been able to make much progress. Julian is quick on his tail. And, Liam, we know he has plenty of experience climbing ladders. [Liam] He's going for that steel rod approach. A little bit more secure. It may not be the fastest or straightest route up, but it's definitely the steadier. [grunts] [dramatic music] [Alex] Tyler picked the steady path, too. He's not going to risk it. He's getting closer! Tyler Lucas is right there, Liam! [Liam] He flew 6,000 miles for a chance to face his big brother... -Come on, Tyler, come on. -and he knows he is just mere feet away from pulling that victory chain. [Alex] Julian is not far behind. [grunts] But Tyler is reaching for the chain! He's got it! Whoo! That's my brother! Whoo! Let's go, Tyler! -[Alex] What a run! -Let's go, baby! Tyler Lucas, he came to compete. He came to win. [Liam] And no surprise, first place Tyler goes is to his big brother and best friend. And later tonight, he'll be on Mount Olympus. You did it! You did it! you did it! Whoo! And that's where there's a chance he could be facing Kyle if he wins his match tonight. [dramatic music] So here's what I want to do right now. Give everybody around the world an idea of how energetic this Titan Arena is. I'ma point to this side, you guys scream, "Sexiest." [cheers and applause] Here we go. [all] Sexiest! -"Man alive." -[all] Man alive! [laughter] Yes, and I am known worldwide for my modesty, clearly. It is time for our next battle. Come on! In this battle, two absolute powerhouses. One's a mom and a nurse who can dead lift {\an7}over three times her weight. That's her body weight. The other is a swim coach who transformed herself mentally and physically. [groovy music] Jackie Wood is most at home in the water, and she makes a living as a kid's swim coach. You can do it. I'll help you. I absolutely love swim coaching. My kiddos are the light to my day. Good luck, Coach Jackie! Let's go, Jackie! They inspire me, motivate me. The name of my business is Swim Strong Academy. I want them all to grow up and be strong and confident. [Cari] Jackie has struggled herself with low self-confidence and, oftentimes, depression. I have had to overcome self-doubt. It put me in a pretty dark place, staying in bed and not taking care of myself. As a mother, it was really painful for me to see you be in that dark place. My Mom is my biggest fan and pulled me out of my darkness and has made me into the competitor that I am today. Winning The Titan Games would mean getting rid of all my self-doubt, period. ♪ Now not dead, not done ♪ ♪ We shall overcome ♪ [upbeat music] [Cari] Kelsey Horton spends her days taking care of others, both at her job as a nurse in South Dakota and as a mother of two. -I love you. -Love you, too. [Cari] But after she puts her kids to bed, her inner Titan takes over. ♪ We came to conquer We came to win ♪ I really, really get excited when I step through that threshold of the gym and that switch turns on and I can go beast mode. I'm very competitive. I absolutely hate to lose. I want to prove that whatever it is, I can tackle it, I can do it, and I can do it well. I may seem like a sweet and innocent nurse, mom, and wife from South Dakota, but I'm here to be a Titan. ♪ Hey, hey ♪ [cheers and applause] [Liam] Kelsey and Jackie are about to take their shot on the Vortex. {\an7}Let's get things cranking, DJ. Jackie, Kelsey, leave it all out on the line, and just know that we're all behind you. This is Vortex. [dramatic music] [Liam] Jackie in the blue. Kelsey in the red. Crank those chains back, and raise that chain tower. [Alex] Oh, man, and it is a full body workout, this challenge, Because not only are you working your upper body here, Liam, but then, once you bring the tower up, guess what? You got to work those legs. [Liam] Kelsey seems to have found a little bit of a rhythm here. She's using those shorter, quicker pulls. Let's go, Kelsey! You can do it! Let's go! [Alex] On the other side, Coach Jackie's taking longer strokes. [grunts] She's got a four-inch reach advantage and a slight lead. She's looking to make mama proud. Oh, my God. Come on! Let's go! Coach Jackie has a smooth backstroke. [Liam] Both women are slowing down. Their back, arm, and shoulder muscles losing steam. Which is why Kelsey is bending and pressing back with her legs. [Alex] Just a few more feet, and those towers are up. [grunts] [Liam] And now, Jackie's gate goes down. That means her tower is up. [Alex] Yeah, things only get tougher from here. There's no easy way to reach Mount Olympus. [Liam] Does she go on those fixed rods, which is more of a diagonal run, or does she take on the chain-link and try to climb straight up? At this point, it becomes problem solving. [grunts] And now here comes Kelsey. [Dwayne] These ladies are gassed. That fatigue is setting in right now. This is so difficult. [grunts] [Alex] You start to grab on to the chain, and then things start to get a little wobbly. Your arms feel like spaghetti. Jackie's going backwards. She's back on the ground, and Kelsey just took the lead! Come on, don't give up. Let's go, Jackie. Come on! You got this! [grunts] [Liam] Kelsey describes herself as a sweet, nurturing nurse, but she's capable of flipping the switch -and going beast mode. -There you go. And even though Jackie started climbing first, Goldenboy, you can see how quickly things can change on the Vortex. [Alex] Every muscle they need to climb, they just shredded to pull this tower up. [Liam] And Kelsey seems to be finding her path. Remember, this is someone who works all day as a nurse, comes home, puts the kids to bed, and then, she's going in, powerlifting, so she's not gonna get too exhausted. She's going to keep going. She's making her way up. Let me tell you, after I'm done with work for the day, I go home, and I play video games, so clearly these people are just in another world. [Liam] Same amount of exertion. And now Coach Jackie's evened this up. -Climb it! Come on! -This is so close. [Alex] They are going through a war right now, and look at Jackie hooking her arm under, engaging her bicep, a muscle that might have a little power left. [dramatic music] [Liam] Jackie, she's right near the top now. What a comeback, but Kelsey is so close. [grunts] [Alex] This is absolutely incredible! Kelsey is right there, but Jackie pulls the victory chain! [cheers and applause] And that was a slugfest, but my goodness, Liam. You could not have asked for a more grueling, more insane competition than what we saw. [Liam] The reaction from Jackie's mother, Jeanne, says it all. Jackie, down at the bottom behind, found her way up top. Now on her way to Mount Olympus as her Mom looks on. When Jackie fell behind, that self-doubt must have crept back in, but she powered through, and Mom knows just how much that means. And Jackie will face off with NASCAR pioneer Brehanna Daniels for the chance to become a Titan and continue on in this competition. Oh, you almost had it. -You almost had it. -Thank you. -Thanks for giving it your all. -Hey, thank you for having us. -You did great. -This has been absolutely amazing. What can I say except ♪ you're welcome? ♪ Oh, thank you! My daughter will love that. Awesome, well, tell your daughter I said hello, and thank you for doing this. -Thank you so much. -You did great. [dramatic music] [Liam] Welcome back to Titan Arena. And now it's time for the next Lucas brother to take his turn. Right there in red is {\an7}Air Force sergeant Kyle Lucas. Earlier, we saw Kyle's younger brother, Tyler, win his match. {\an7}[Alex] And now he's in the stands, hoping Kyle will win and join him on Mount Olympus so they can settle their lifelong sibling rivalry. As kids, we were super competitive in wrestling, football, just anything in general. We're still competitive now. My whole life, my Mom has always been, like, "Your brother looks up to you," and now it's flipped. I look up to him, and that just drives me to be better. [dramatic music] He's my idol, and every day, I strive to be like Tyler Lucas, because that's someone you want to be like. I'm going to win Titan Games, and prove that I belong with the best of the best. [cheers and applause] [Liam] If Kyle wants to face Tyler, he'll have to beat this guy first. Matt Welbourn also comes from a family of athletes. [rock music] [Cari] Matt Welbourn's father was an Olympian in both pole vault and kayak. Matt followed in his footsteps, becoming an elite track-and-field athlete before dedicating himself to weightlifting. Now 220 pounds, this Colorado waiter {\an7}bears a striking resemblance {\an7}to another famous bodybuilder. People say I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, so I'll hit them with the Arnold impression right on the spot. [as Schwarzenegger] Get to the chopper! I'm here! Kill me! Kill me! Do it! Dwayne, I'm going to dominate the competition, because I've been doing the repetitions in the gym. I'm getting the pump, and nobody else is getting the pump like I'm doing. I'm going to be a Titan! [cheers and applause] [Liam] Trying to make Arnold proud, it's the Titan express. {\an7}All aboard for Off the Rails. [dramatic music] On this long, painful trip down the wrong side of the tracks, you must first pull yourself and a 200-pound sled along a 60-foot rail, collecting 50-pound beams along the way. [Liam] By the end, you'll be pulling 600 pounds. Then, to get back, you'll need precision and coordination to hook the anchor, and reel yourself to the victory chain. [cheers and applause] All right, like these guys, I know what it's like to grow up in an athletic family. It's incredibly inspiring, but it's also challenging, because you can't help but compare yourself to those closest to you. And what I've learned is that when it's game time, it's not about your roots. It's all about what's in front of you. So, Kyle and Matt, your time to shine is now. This is Off the Rails. [dramatic music] [Liam] Matt in the blue. Kyle in the red. And look at Kyle go. [Alex] Oh, Kyle falls off. But he's back up and still has the early lead. [Liam] You see those 50-pound beams piling up, 200 pounds by the end. Kyle's bending his legs, keeping his arms in line with the rope, giving him more power with each pull. [Alex] Kyle reaches the end first, with Matt right on his tail. [Liam] Turn the corner, you're on your way back. You don't have the weights there, but now you have to use that hook. [Alex] Oh, Kyle sent that hook flying, but his hook doesn't catch anything against the rail. [dramatic music] It is going to be Matt who is moving first. He's going for the shorter throws and the shorter pulls. Nice. [Liam] The shorter throws are safer. If you throw long and the hook doesn't catch, you waste time reeling it all the way back. [Alex] Now Kyle finally hooks that rail. This airman is dying to face his little brother on Mount Olympus. Let's go! But look at Matt! Mini-Arnold is making a big move. [Liam] He's only got four ties left. Let's go! Let's go! [Alex] Kyle's going to have to go for a long throw. Time is running out. [Liam] Kyle can't set the hook. Come on, Kyle! Come on! [Alex] And Matt Welbourn, he is right there. [dramatic music] Kicks down the gate, charges the victory chain! The Titan Games has a new Terminator. [Liam] That's right. The son of an Olympian headed to Mount Olympus. He takes down Kyle Lucas. Next up is Kyle's brother, Tyler. I'm proud of you, bro. [Liam] Lucas brothers embrace. Kyle eliminated. Tyler, still keeping the dream alive of becoming a Titan. [Alex] This race was all about the angles. Kyle went for the long throws, and had trouble getting his hook to catch hold. Matt went with the short hauls and had a quicker trip to the victory chain. [Liam] So the Lucas Brothers won't get the chance to battle on Mount Olympus, but they're standing by with Cari. Kyle, how are you feeling? I couldn't be more proud of my brother. He is an amazing athlete, um, you know. He's... He's my favorite to win it. Tyler, how do you feel? Your brother is giving you major props. You know, I'm very glad I got to share this experience with him. And, you know, I'm going to, you know, work my butt off to do this for him. [Cari] You're going to represent the family very well. Congratulations. You're going to Mount Olympus, but more importantly, you guys love each other. -Brotherly love. -Those are some good boys. [cheers and applause] -I'm proud of you, man. -I'm proud of you too. Hey, you're... you're gonna go out there, You're gonna kill this. [dramatic music] Earlier tonight, four athletes persevered through physical grit and sheer determination. But to actually become a Titan, you need to conquer this monster. It's seven grueling physical trials that can propel you to greatness. Two more athletes are about to face off. It's the NASCAR trailblazer, Brehanna Daniels, and the unstoppable swim coach, Jackie Wood. Now, neither of your wins came easy, and it's not going to get any easier. Mount Olympus is unforgiving. You both know that. But I know you're going to dig deep, fight through your fatigue, and hold nothing back. So, Brehanna, Jackie, it's time to get to work. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Brehanna in the red. Jackie in the blue. Attack the wall! [Alex] The 1,000-pound wall, and you've got to give it everything you got to topple it. Go, go, go! Jackie knocks it down first, but Brehanna's right behind. Whoo! Whoo! [Liam] They get to the Gates of Olympus, driving with their legs to get that first one moving. But it's getting heavier with each additional gate. [grunts] [grunts] [Alex] Just imagine the power it takes to press 450 pounds up a ski slope. This is a tight race. Come on, ladies. Come on, ladies. And now we move on to the Rolling Ascent, and if you're Brehanna, her job in NASCAR takes quick reflexes and agility. Exactly what she needs here, but oh! She's spinning out, Liam. [grunts] [Liam] Same thing on the other side for Jackie. She's three deep, looking good, and now scoot past the next couple. [dramatic music] [grunts] Jackie, so close from completing the Rolling Ascent. [grunts] [Alex] And both women do it at the same time, and this match couldn't be any closer -heading to The Cliffs! -Yes, go, go, go! [Liam] Tight, tense, and now it's time to punch, kick, elbow, anything and everything you've got to create holes in this wall so you can scale it. [Alex] Jackie starts her climb first. Brehanna being a little more cautious. Come on, ladies. Punch through. Punch through. [grunts] [Liam] It looks like it's Jackie who's going to be first up the wall. [grunts] -Yes, yes, yes, go. -Let's go! But it is still so close, Liam. Brehanna Daniels is just a few feet from the top. You got it, girl! You got this! Jackie Wood makes her way over to raise the torch. 600 pounds! This will take everything Jackie has. And Brehanna's not there yet. That's 12 feet down. We've seen bad falls here before. Let's go, Brehanna. [Liam] Brehanna just up over The Cliff. [Alex] Now is the time. 600 pounds that they have to bring up. [grunts] [Liam] Look at Jackie. This swim coach is having to throw her whole body into the crank. [Alex] But don't forget about Brehanna Daniels. She destroyed Uprising, so we know she's strong. Jackie Wood is the first one to complete the Torch, and now she's heading down the mountain! Come on! Get down here to me! [grunts] [Alex] Brehanna Daniels, still struggling to bring up that torch. The Descent, three walls, the first one five feet, then six feet, then seven. [dramatic music] [grunts] [Alex] Jackie's having a little trouble at that six-foot wall. This might buy Brehanna a little time to catch up. [Liam] Brehanna is doing everything she can. Now it's turning, and now the torch is about to go up. But Coach Jackie is coming down that final slide. [Alex] Jackie Wood has scaled down Mount Olympus, and now it is time for the Ball and Chain. Go, Jacqueline! Let's go! [grunts] [Alex] And now here comes Brehanna! Here we go, Brehanna. Here we go. It's time for this NASCAR tire queen to burn some rubber. [grunts] [yells] Get it! [dramatic music] Come on, Brehanna! Get down here, Brehanna! [Liam] You see just how tough this is. 200 pounds, and it is slow going for Jackie right now. [Alex] Brehanna's coming down the mountain, but she still needs to find another gear. [grunts] Jackie Wood is hacking away at the tomb. Brehanna has to hurry up! She has to gain speed! Because our swim coach is turning the lid of that Tomb into rubble. [Liam] Brehanna is coming down to the floor. She's not done yet, but Jackie Wood is right there. -[Alex] She has it! -Oh, my God. [Liam] She's got the relic! Come on. [Alex] Jackie Wood has locked it in, and she is your next Titan. [cheers and applause] -Congratulations. -Oh, my God. -That was amazing. -Congratulations. -It was so awesome. -You were amazing. -Thank you so much. -You were amazing. Oh, my God, she did it. [Liam] Doubt yourself no longer, Jackie Wood, -because you're a Titan. -Attagirl! Attagirl! -Let me get up there. -Do it! [cheers and applause] That's how you do it. Yeah! You were amazing. [Liam] Brehanna Daniels, a courageous run that would have made her Mom proud, but it's Jackie Wood who gets the win. -Jackie, congratulations. -Oh, my God. -Thank you so much. -You're a Titan. -This means so much to me. -Aw. [dramatic music] All right, it's two athletes with extreme power and passion. I chose them for a reason, and they proved me right by dominating their challenges earlier tonight. Going up against Matt, he's a strong competitor. He beat my brother, you know? [Alex] Kyle Lucas has to catch Matt Welbourn. Tonight I got to avenge my brother's loss. I've sent home that first brother, and I'm going to send home the next. [Alex] Matthew Welbourn! [as Schwarzenegger] Tyler, I'm coming for you. I'm going to pump you up! Matt, Tyler, you've both made your families very, very proud tonight, and I know you both want to leave here a Titan more than anything. So right now, I want you to shift into gears you thought you never had {\an7}and give it everything you got. -Let's go, Tyler! -This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Matt in the red. Tyler in the blue. [barking] Oh! Oh! [Alex] Tyler tackled that thing down. Now Matt's through, and they charge right into the Gates of Olympus. Wow. [grunts] [dramatic music] [Liam] Tyler Lucas is plowing right through that, and Matt's right on his heels. Let's go, Tyler! Run, run, run! [Alex] Now it's on to the Rolling Ascent, and Tyler Lucas on his hands and knees. It's like he's floating up the rollers, wow! [grunts] Matt Welbourn, he's got to make up ground. Now it's over to The Cliffs. Tyler, Tyler, Tyler! Matt Welbourn, he's stuck. He can't seem to get over. -Let's go, Matt! -Come on, Matt! Let's go! Go, go, go, go, go. Come on! [Liam] Look at this strategy. Matt's actually rolling the log forward to help carry him over. Tyler on The Cliffs, making his way. [grunts] [Alex] And Matt's roller technique worked! But now he's going to need some blunt force at the wall, because for Tyler, family honor is on the line here. [grunts] There we go. [Liam] Tyler, trying to raise that torch. The rope, it will tighten up, and you will feel the weight. That's 600 pounds, three times what Tyler weighs. [Alex] You see Matt's still on The Cliffs. He was pushing to catch up and punched those holes way too big. [grunts] And Tyler, the Air Force sergeant, raises the Torch! Let's go! Bring it home! Bring it home! [Liam] And now it's The Descent. There are three walls... five feet, six feet, and seven feet. Tyler needs to keep pushing, because with Matt's strength, you know he'll have plenty of power for that crank. [grunts] Tyler, get down here. Come on. [Alex] Tyler Lucas flew 6,000 miles from Germany to be here. Flying like the Air Force down Mount Olympus. And his next stop's the Ball and Chain. Come on, bro! Let's go! He wants some payback for his brother's defeat. He's not done yet. Look at that. Look at that strength! [Liam] 250 pounds, and Tyler is backing it up. He was a college quarterback. You know those arms have power. Come on, Tyler. Come on. [grunts] -[Alex] Here comes Matt. -Go, Matt! Go, go, go! If he doesn't get down there, it's hasta la vista, baby! [dramatic music] [Liam] Tyler Lucas, pounding away at the tomb. [Alex] Matt's making his way down the mountain, -but Tyler has broken through. -Let's go, Tyler! Come on. He wanted to avenge his brother. He wanted to be the one Lucas to reign over them all. Ladies and gentleman, Tyler Lucas is your Titan! [cheers and applause] [Kyle] There we go. Let's go! Let's go, baby! Come on. Congratulations. -Thank you. -Great job. Go see your family. Let's go! Let's go! I love you, man. I'm proud of you. [Alex] He came to The Titan Games hoping to beat his brother. Instead he got to defend his family's honor. [Liam] The little bro gets the big win for the Lucas family, and now he's a Titan. [dramatic music] Ah, congratulations, brother, and thank you for your service. -Hey, I appreciate it, sir. -Very proud of you. -Thank you. -Tequila's on me. Oh, hell, yeah, let's go. [Liam] Jackie and Tyler are our newest Titans, and next week, we'll crown two more. In a few weeks, they'll all compete in the Battle of the Titans. We'll see you next week on The Titan Games. Let's go! [dramatic music]
