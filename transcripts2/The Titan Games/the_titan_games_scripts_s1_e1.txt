 [dramatic music] [Dwayne] From the beginning, I wanted to redefine what an athletic competition can be. I wanted to create a platform for people who always had the ability, but never the chance to unlock their full potential.

 Showing a kid who thought there's no hope that there is hope is my driving factor for being on The Titan Games.

Welcome to The Titan Games. ♪ Gotta hold on ♪ [wind blowing] [dramatic music] [Alex] Please welcome Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson! [cheers and applause] Bang. Yes. [cheering and applause] Welcome to Titan Arena. This show has been years in the making. My idea was to create the ultimate test of athleticism and heart, and I decided to put together a dream team... scientists, sport psychologists, engineers, the criminally insane, anyone who could help bring me the biggest, baddest, most exciting challenges ever assembled. [cheers and applause] But I didn't come alone. Joining me is someone I've been a fan of for a very long time, the only person coming into these games already a champion. Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Cari Champion. -Thanks, DJ. -Yes. We're kicking things off with two tough women. By day, these competitors are both healers, but by night, they're monster athletes. One's a physical therapist they call the Fit Doctor. the other is a massage therapist who goes by Pit Bull. There's two sides to Emily Andzulis. By day, she's a healer... What would you like for me to work on today? a masseuse, but by night, she's a badass... ♪ I'ma slay somebody ♪ a 5'2" bundle of pure power. I'm a third-degree black belt in tae kwon do. I'm a blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I've been a fighter since five years old. It's in my blood. It's in my sister's blood for sure. It was about five years ago that my sister got diagnosed with bone cancer, and they had to remove the entire shinbone. Boom. Whoa. Punch here. I live with her and her husband and my nieces to help her, whatever she needs. Emily's the definition of a sister. She's sacrificial. She does everything for me. She's my best friend. I know there's going to be a moment in this competition where it's going to break me, but that's when I'm gonna fight back. In honor of my sister, I will be a Titan. [Cari] The Titan Games is a competition for everyday people, so preparing means finding time to train, no matter how busy your schedule is. I've been a physical therapist for, uh, six years now. It's my career path. However it's also in alignment with my lifestyle. And sometimes that even includes using their equipment to get my gains. [Cari] Hard work has never been a problem for Dr. Proctor. I played college basketball. University of West Alabama is where I lettered. It was just a huge accomplishment for me coming from a small town to get a scholarship to play my dream game, but my Mom told me since I was a little kid, "If you're gonna be anything, be the best." My mother is here to watch me compete, and it means everything to me. Um, growing up playing sports, she wasn't always at my games, because having to work and support us, so when she would come to the games, it was like having, like, a celebrity in the stands. She's got it! 'Ey! I've been training my whole life for this opportunity. I'm ready. I'm ready. Hello, everyone. I'm Liam McHugh, with my partner Alex "Goldenboy" Mendez. [Alex] Liam, this is {\an7}our tug of war from the gods, pyramid of pain. {\an7}We call it the Herculean Pull. DJ wanted to create a challenge where you outleverage an opponent you can't even see. {\an7}[Liam] First, you use grip {\an7}strength and upper-body power to unthread two 100-pound silver poles, each longer than a pickup truck. {\an7}[Alex] Next is a blind tug of war with the golden pole, and you can't use the ground for help. [Liam] Whoever can hang on and generate the most force will hit the target and punch their ticket to Mount Olympus. So it's Dr. Proctor versus the Pit Bull. You heard Dwayne say it earlier. He's waited years for this moment. [Alex] And now it's finally here, so take it away, DJ. Ayonna and Emily, no one controls your fate, but you. Clear your mind, take a deep breath, and show the world what you're capable of. This is Herculean Pull. [crowd cheering] [Liam] And the race is on. [Alex] Both competitors have gone to the opposite sides of the pyramid, so now it's a battle to pull out that 100-pound pole. [Liam] They're using their arms to pull and their legs to push off the pyramid. [Alex] And look at that. Ayonna actually falls down at the sheer weight of the pole and the force that she's exerting. [Liam] Both athletes have one pole out, working on the second pole before they move on -to that golden pole. -[Alex] Uh-oh, wait a minute, Emily managed to get the pole out first. Now she's gonna climb up to the top of the golden pole. Emily falls right off, giving Ayonna the chance to climb up to the golden pole. Ayonna, now, is gonna be on the attack here. [Liam] Look at the leg strength. Ayonna Proctor right there, getting herself right back in this. They are digging deep. [Alex] Both women fighting with everything they've got, desperate to move on to Mount Olympus. Ayonna has managed to make this one into a neck-and-neck battle, and she's taken the lead. And for Emily, she's got the powerful hands of a masseuse. She's got to use that grip to even things up here. Go! Go! All you got! This comes down to who wants it more. [Liam] And for Ayonna, you're trying to hang on to pull the pole back without losing your balance or your grip. Pull it back! Pull it back! -[Alex] Oh! -[Liam] But she falls down! [Alex] But Emily has no idea, and the golden pole is headed in the other direction. The Pit Bull pulling with all her might. Emily's on her tiptoes, and she's getting leverage from her knees. She's just inches away, and Ayonna holding on for dear life. And, oh, she's right there. Just... Oh! -[Liam] And there it is. -[Alex] That's it, and she's moving on to Mount Olympus. [Liam] The massage therapist, the mixed martial artist, and now one step closer to being a Titan. -Ayonna, yo, good job. -Thank you. -Great job. -Okay. [Liam] And pure elation for Emily. Ayonna got off to a rough start and hit the ground hard. Emily got to the golden pole first. Dr. Proctor fought valiantly, and it looked like she had it, but when she fell, Emily, the Pit Bull, grabbed hold and didn't let go, securing the victory. -[cheers and applause] -Good job. Good job. [Liam] Now Emily is headed to Mount Olympus with the chance to become a Titan. [dramatic music] Hey, guys. [all screaming] Thank you so much. -Pleasure. Nice to meet you. -Welcome. Welcome. -How you guys doing? -Great. Look, when you guys go out there, you... you know, the nerves are gonna be there. That's normal, right, but it's what we live for, moments like this. And also remember, like, you guys have earned the right to be here, so everybody out there cheering you on, I mean, they're here to see you, all right. I mean, they're here to see me a little bit, but... [laughter] So go out and have fun and, um, yeah, and go kick ass. [Alex] Hey, nothing like a pep talk from The Rock to get you fired up. [Liam] Now, let's get back to the action. DJ? I've always lived my life by the creed, blood, sweat, respect. The first two you give. The last one you earn. I've always lived my life by another creed. A nice romantic dinner, a bottle of very fine tequila will lead to one sexy date night. Yes. That's why I keep having Rock babies. Too much information. Time for our next battle. This is a matchup of two hard-working guys, I don't know if they like {\an7}tequila or not. We'll find out, But one's a truck driver who works long days, but still finds time to chase his Titan dream. The other's a construction worker who had a tough road to get here. People might look at me and think I'm just a regular, normal guy. But I guarantee you that any competitor out there that would go against me has not put in the work that I've put in. Here you go, Mike. {\an7}[Cari] Surprisingly, Mike Evans wasn't an athlete in high school. His journey to The Titan Games began seven years ago when he started working construction with his Dad. I thought you'd be carrying three. You're only carrying two. It's father and son, but it's also like... like I'm his brother almost. I'm very proud of you, and I know your Mom would be really proud of you, too. My childhood was very difficult. My Mom was sick. She actually had Parkinson's disease, and she struggled with drug addiction. I was 13 years old when my Mom passed away. I remember being afraid of the dark, not wanting to eat, not wanting to talk to anybody, but I never gave up, I always stayed positive, and I found something that I love. I go to the gym two hours a night, six days a week. After the gym, I always visit my Mom at the cemetery. I want to keep her memory alive. I'm absolutely competing for my Mom. I've trained harder than I've ever trained. Nothing will stop me from becoming a Titan. [cheers and applause] [Liam] Mike Evans is formidable, but his opponent, who calls himself the Haitian Sensation, feels like his whole life has led to this moment. [Cari] Dwayne Johnson designed this competition for people like James Jean-Louis, who hits the gym every day, even after a 12-hour shift carrying Budweiser kegs around Miami. Over a day, I deliver 500 cases of beer. I need to work hard, because where I'm from, second chances don't come like this often, and this is a major second chance for me. When I was 23 years old, I got arrested. It scared me a lot. I didn't think that I was gonna be there to raise my son, and that was my wake-up call. That's when I realized it's time for me to step up to the plate and become a father. Above all else, you know, you come first. [laughs] How's it going? [Cari] Every day, James wakes at 4:00 a.m... You save this for later. [Cari] makes breakfast for nine-year-old Semaj and gets him off to school. Then it's sunup to sundown delivering beer... {\an7}some heavy lifting in the gym, pick up Semaj, and make them dinner. And then he gets up early and does it all again. Let me get my pushups, man. It's a grind, but he's setting an example for the most important person in his life. I want my son to actually look at me as his hero, and so I can't fail. A Titan is a person who went through hardships but overcame them. I will be a Titan. {\an7}[Liam] And there's Semaj along {\an7}with James' Dad and his sister. [Alex] Three generations {\an7}of Jean-Louis men in the house. And look at that physique. He gives new meaning to the term six-pack abs, Liam. Here's the thing. James and Mike about to get medieval on this challenge. It was inspired by the way ancient armies would lay siege to a castle. Behold, the mighty Hammering Ram. This brutal test will challenge all eight muscle groups in your upper body. [Liam] You start by swinging the ten-pound hammer against a metal plate, generating upwards of half a ton of force with every swing {\an7}until it triggers the release of the 350-pound ram. [Alex] From there, it's a test of brute force to see who can break through {\an7}the massive wooden doors first, pull the victory chain, and claim your spot on Mount Olympus. This is exactly what I envisioned {\an7}when I conceived these games, {\an7}everyday people who are also {\an7}ridiculously talented athletes going head-to-head. They've always deserved a platform to show the world what they've got, and now they finally have one. James and Mike, this is your opportunity. This is your moment. This is Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] [Liam] It's time to throw down. Step one, smashing that steel plate with your ten-pound hammer. [Alex] Both guys putting those massive muscles to work, one righty and one lefty. Go, James! Go, James! [Alex] Both rams are down. It's time to rock. [Liam] You need to generate enough momentum to get that 350-pound ram through the giant door. You see Mike Evans using those long arms, that 6'5" frame to swing it. [groans] But on the other side, James Jean-Louis knows the further back you can pull the ram, the more force you have to hit the barrier. [Alex] Both boards are cracking. Who's gonna break through first? [grunts] James Jean-Louis goes through, and he manages to grab the victory chain. Now Mike breaks through, but it's too late. I did this! -Yeah! -[cheering] [James] Good job, baby. Good job. The Haitian Sensation kicks that ass. [laughs] Come on, baby. Come on. Come on! I did this for you, dawg! I told you, man. I told you, man. [Alex] James Jean-Louis says his son is his inspiration. We came all the way. I love you, man. [Jean] That's what I'm talking about! [James] I love you, man. [Liam] Now, he's one step closer to showing Semaj that Daddy can be a Titan. [dramatic music] There it is, Mount Olympus. Tonight, right here, one woman and one man, will be crowned Titans. Now, I told my Titan engineers, I want the physical manifestation of what it would look like if Mount Everest -had a baby with Godzilla. -[laughter] But look, here's the thing. We don't give away a chance to have a baby with Godzilla. No, you got to earn that special prize, and you do that by winning this next challenge. Let's meet our competitors. [Cari] Ben Afuvai grew up in a large family in American Samoa. Early on, he didn't appear to be headed for Titan glory. I was a chubby one. I weighed about 262 pounds. My size really kind of made me lose my confidence in myself. My wife, she motivated me to get fit and be healthy. I work 16 hours some day. I still make time for the gym, because I have goals. I have big dreams, you know? The Titan Games are coming to NBC. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, he's my idol. You might just have a spot on the team. I want to be on Dwayne's team, because I want to chase greatness. We were online searching and we see Titan Games. What are you doing? Girl, this is my video for The Rock show, man. {\an7}-Don't I look like his cousin? -[cell phone ringing] [Dwayne] Yo, Ben, what's up, uso? -Hey, what's up? -How you doing? This is Dwayne Johnson. -Oh, my God, no! -[laughing] -[laughs] -Oh, my... No! If this is a prank... Is this a prank? Yes, this is. This is a prank. This is Denzel Washington. I just called to... No, oh, my God, no! This is not true. I just want to tell you, just because you're Samoan and I'm Samoan as well, and you look like you could be my cousin, that doesn't mean you're gonna get any special treatment when you come to The Titan Games. Welcome to the show, brother. Thank you so much. I'm so excited. He's excited. {\an7}[Liam] Ben's family flew down from Tacoma, Washington, to be here tonight. Let's go, Ben! And they're going to see Ben face one seriously strong soldier. [Cari] Anthony Fuhrman, a military recruiter who served in Afghanistan, has one key Titan attribute in spades. I have an 805-pound dead lift. I have a 500-pound bench press, a 405-pound overhead press. I've pulled semis. You name it, I've done it. But what you don't know about me is that I have another side, and I call him, La Flama Blanca. La Flama Blanca is my over-the-top persona. Part of the reason La Flama Blanca exists is to push Anthony Fuhrman past boundaries that he would fail or quit at. La Flama Blanca will put on some Taylor Swift when he's training. ♪ Shake it off Shake it off ♪ One person called me a larger, stronger Richard Simmons. [laughs] ♪ Shake it off, shake it off ♪ You better watch out, because La Flama Blanca's coming to the stage. ♪ I shake it off I shake it off ♪ Goldenboy, when you see a couple of heavy hitters like Anthony and Ben, {\an7}you are ready for them to just {\an7}tear the roof off the place. [Alex] And luckily for us, we don't have a roof in the Titan Arena, so we're doing the next best thing, letting them smash through five solid floors with an anvil. We call it Uprising. [Liam] This is DJ's ultimate challenge for lower body and core strength. [Alex] The goal is to raise a 40-pound anvil {\an7}to the top of a 30-foot tower. Standing in your way are five, 3-inch-thick solid barriers. Breaking through each slab will require the anvil to be moving at ten miles per hour. [Liam] If you're the first to bust through, you're moving on to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] Who's gonna go harder, run faster, dig deeper? Who's gonna grab their moment, move on to Mount Olympus and possibly become a Titan? Anthony, Ben, time to seize that moment and find out. This is Uprising. [dramatic music] -[Alex] Pure, raw power. -[Liam] Right out of the gate. [Alex] Anthony just shatters through that first one, goes through the second. [Liam] Ben's driving forward, but the resistance is lifting him up. [Alex] Anthony just destroys it. [laughing] [Liam] Only two floors left for Anthony. -[Alex] Oh, my word. -[screams] La Flama Blanca just mutilated one of our most brutal challenges in 22 seconds. He is a beast. Congratulations. [Liam] Hey, Ben, just, just shake it off. Nothing to be ashamed of losing to a monster like Anthony. This guy's gonna be tough to beat. [Alex] Sergeant Fuhrman turned that anvil into an atom bomb. He blasted through the last two slabs in one move. As Taylor Swift would say, "Look what you made me do..." to Uprising. [Liam] Anthony Fuhrman celebrating an impressive victory. He'll face Budweiser deliveryman James Jean-Louis on Mount Olympus for the chance to become our first Titan. All right, here's the thing. Brute strength and raw determination... well, they're more than just the keys to beating Jason Statham in a prison fight, which, for the record, is really not that difficult to do, because I've done it. They're essential to winning this next challenge. Let's knock down some doors. This is gonna be fun. Time for our next Titan Games battle. [cheers and applause] DJ, you're right. This one is gonna be fun. The matchup features two strong women who shatter expectations. One's a height-defying sheet-metal installer. The other is a veteran firefighter who, listen to this, is also a grandmother. [dramatic music] Fire doesn't care if I'm 50, if I'm 20, if I'm 30. It doesn't care if I'm a man or I'm a woman. [alarm bell ringing] I've proudly been serving as a firefighter for over 19 years now. [siren wailing] [Cari] The Titan Games celebrates the remarkable, everyday people amongst us, and Julie Dudley fits the bill. I'm thrilled to be able to say I'm a grandma and in the best shape of my life. I'm very close to my children. My daughter still actually lives with us. You're gonna show everybody that grandmas rule. [both laughing] [Cari] Never afraid of a challenge, Julie now has a new mountain to climb. I want to be a Titan to prove to people that at 50 years old, you can be strong and tough, and do whatever it is that you want to do. Don't let your age be an excuse. It can be done. [Cari] Julie's opponent is half her age. 26-year-old Tina Rivas has a high-risk job usually reserved for men. I'm gonna do some cutting. I started working with sheet metal, because they pay 50 bucks an hour, but because I was work... in high-rise on the edge of a building, it's a dangerous kind of job 'cause if you just get distracted a little bit and, you know, you're not tied off properly, you can fall. I'm the only woman, so obviously it is a little bit hard, but I can handle it. [Cari] Tina is hoping that her exceptional work ethic is her path to becoming a Titan. I love building my body. I get up at 4:00 in the morning. I work eight- to ten-hour shifts, and then I go straight to the gym every single day. I worked so hard to be here. It means a lot to be here at The Titan Games. I will be a Titan. [Liam] Julie and Tina, they are in for a treat. [Alex] It's the return of the Hammering Ram. [Liam] Hammers up, they're ready to throw down, and we're ready to send it down to DJ. This challenge is a monster, but personally, I don't think a fearless sheet-metal worker and a badass grandma are the least bit intimidated. This is what you have both been working for. One of you is moving on to Mount Olympus. One of you is going home. Julie, Tina, don't hold anything back. This is Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] [Liam] Zero hesitation. Both competitors immediately grab that hammer, start hacking away. [Alex] Tina wrestles with metal all day at work, but I don't think they let her take a sledgehammer 1,000 feet in the air. Let's go, ladies! [Liam] On the flip side, Julie usually does this kind of thing with an ax and with flames surrounding her. {\an7}Keep swinging! Keep swinging! keep swinging! [Liam] Aim plays a role here. You need to strike dead center to move the post and release the ram. -Yeah! Yeah! -And there it is for Julie. The ram is down, but remember, it's 350 pounds. And now Tina's ram is down. [Alex] Julie, though, she's gonna do what she does best as a firefighter. She is gonna crash through doors. [grunting] [Liam] Tina's working to build up momentum, but she's gripping that rope a little high, which makes it hard to get wide swings. [Alex] Look at the momentum Julie's generating right now. She's staying low to the ground... Oh, Julie is through. And she has pulled the victory chain. Wow, I cannot believe it! Can your grandmother do that? That's amazing. [chuckles] [Alex] Julie Dudley, a veteran firefighter from Jupiter, Florida, defies all odds, all expectations. You did it, baby. Oh, you did it. I love you. [Liam] 50-year-old Julie Dudley will be battling it out with Emily Andzulis, for a chance {\an7}to be our first female Titan. [Alex] Welcome back to Titan Arena. The crowd is on their feet, because we're about to crown our first Titan. [Liam] And that means we're about to get our first look at mighty Mount Olympus. [Dwayne] In Greek Mythology, Mount Olympus was where the Gods battled for control over the ancient world. Well, here, it's where our winners battle each other and new legends are created. {\an7}[Dwayne] Mount Olympus is the {\an7}crown jewel in the Titan Arena. From the strength required to push over a half-ton wall and drive 450 pounds up a 25-degree incline... to the agility to climb over six spinning cylinders, each wider than a redwood tree. Each stage of Mount Olympus has been specially designed to test all aspects of athleticism. If you have a weakness, {\an7}the mountain's gonna reveal it. Prove that you can conquer my mountain, {\an7}and you join my team of Titans. [dramatic music] Earlier tonight, we witnessed two badass athletes from Florida, a truck driver and a soldier shine in victory. Now James Jean-Louis and Anthony Fuhrman will face off against each other to earn the historic title of Titan. I'm up against James going to Mount Olympus, and as a competitor, he is very tough. [Liam] James Jean-Louis is getting the hang of it. [Anthony] Very determined, very athletic, but he's also never competed against anyone like me. [James] Anthony is a real powerlifter. I mean, he's strong. -Anthony just destroys it. -Pure raw power. But I have more to prove. This one is for me, my son and everybody that doubted me as well. It's time to shine and conquer Mount Olympus. All right, James, Anthony, I had a mission for this show, find everyday people with extraordinary athletic abilities and give them a platform. Well, this right here is the ultimate platform, and how you got here was very impressive, but when this whole thing is over, only one of you will be leaving a Titan. This is your second chance, baby. Come on. [Dwayne] Dig deep. Lay it all out on the line. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] James in the red, Anthony in the blue, and I half expect Anthony to run through that wall. [Alex] 1,000 pounds knocked down like it was nothing! Oh, my goodness. -Wow! -[Liam] And now to the Gates, each one 150 pounds. Just imagine trying to push 450 pounds up a ski slope. And James is through. Anthony, right on his heels. [Alex] Fuhrman keeping pace. Fuhrman slips! Oh, no! Mount Olympus is the ultimate proving ground. You need strength, speed, agility, and endurance. We know that James Jean-Louis has the agility, and he proved it right there by flying through the Rolling Ascent. Wow, James is like a cat. [Liam] But here comes Fuhrman, desperate to catch James at the Cliffs. [Alex] Okay, this is pure genius, chaos meets creativity. You've got to punch and kick your own path to the top, but if you make the holes too big... Right there. See? They can break. [Liam] And that opens the door. Here comes Anthony Fuhrman. Come on, man. [Alex] No dancing, no Taylor Swift on Mount Olympus. This is all business. [Liam] James clawing 12 feet to the top. He doesn't want to let a beast like Fuhrman reach that crank first. James, up on top of Mount Olympus trying to raise the torch, 600 pounds, 25 feet tall. The first few turns are gonna feel nice and easy, but here comes the grind, and here comes Big Anthony Fuhrman up the Cliff. Come on, man. It's just... [grunts] Let's go, James. Get down here to me. [Alex] James Jean-Louis needs to hurry up because Fuhrman was tailor-made for this task. Look, he's even pulling backwards, all back and biceps. And James Jean-Louis manages to place that torch upright first. Go, James. And now, it's time to descend Mount Olympus. [Liam] You want to be aggressive. There are three walls... five feet, six feet, and seven feet here. He has the lead, and he wants to extend it. [Alex] Fuhrman trying to make up ground. He's got to hurry. Let's go, Anthony. Come on, Anthony. [Alex] James is already down to the third wall, and Fuhrman, we thought he would crush this crank, and he's struggling. [Liam] James, now at that final wall, seven feet high, and he's slowing down. [Alex] The Budweiser deliveryman needs to find another gear, because he still has to pull that 250-pound ball and chain over to the Titan tomb. Come on, man. [grunts] [Liam] Fuhrman finally gets the torch upright and now he's headed down... But oh! Hard landing. James says his son is what motivates and inspires him, and he wants to prove to his son that through hard work and determination, anything is possible. He is just feet away here. -Let's go, James. -Go, James! Go, James! [Alex] Anthony Fuhrman has disappeared. He hit the bottom on that second slide and never came back up. [Liam] There he is. [Alex] James Jean-Louis now starts to toil away at the tomb to pull out that relic and become a Titan. Anthony Fuhrman, though, he's getting shut down at that second wall. [Liam] He's broken through. He's digging around. Just trying to find that relic. [cheering] [Alex] Anthony Fuhrman hasn't gotten up. Anthony Fuhrman hasn't gotten up from Mount Olympus. He hasn't gotten up from Mount Olympus. Meanwhile, James Jean-Louis, he has the relic. -Come on. Come on. -He punches it in. And James Jean-Louis is our first Titan! [inspirational music] Congratulations. Great job, homey. Great job. [Alex] You talk about everyday heroes. This is not your everyday truck driver. Come on. Go see your family. James Jean-Louis dominated Mount Olympus. Mount Olympus, too strong for this super-strong man. I love you, man. I love you, man. Oh, my gosh. Hallelujah. [James] I love you, man. I love you. [Liam] James Jean-Louis proved it takes more than brute strength to beat the mountain. We'll see this hard-working dad in a few weeks in our battle of the Titans, but right now, he's standing by with Cari. James, we know your story. You've been through a lot. You talk about second chances. For those at home tonight who want a second chance, what do you say to them? To anybody that want a second chance, man, stay focused with your dreams, man. Don't give up. I realized that, you know what, I want to be the role model that my son looks up to, and that's what gave me that drive to be here today. When you got that dream, stay strong on it. Keep going. Keep pushing. It's gonna happen. Let's make it official. Go talk to DJ. Come on, brother. Come on. Come on. -Thank you, man. -I'm proud of you, brother, -Thank you, man. Thank you. -Come here. Good job. Thank you for this opportunity, man. I appreciate you for giving me this platform. -You're very welcome. -I appreciate you. Get that cheat meal in now, all right? -Of course, of course. -Come on. [laughing] Stick around. More Titan Games to come. [Liam] Welcome back to Titan Arena. It's time to crown another Titan. Here's DJ. Becoming a Titan is only the beginning for these amazing athletes. At the end of this season, they will all return for the epic Battle of the Titans. When it's all over, one man and one woman will earn the distinction of becoming the first-ever Titan Champions. Now, a match I have been looking forward to between two extraordinary athletes, the human Pit Bull, Emily Andzulis, versus the badass firefighter, Julie Dudley. Going into Mount Olympus against Julie, what gives me an edge {\an7}is that never-give-up attitude. [Alex] Emily, the Pit Bull. I've done martial arts my whole life, and I'm ready. I just beat somebody half my age, {\an7}and I won't lie. It felt good. [Alex] I cannot believe it. I'm not your average grandmother. I can't wait to kick some butt. I'm pumped up for this one. Emily, Julie, your drive and competitive fire are exactly the same, and that's why I chose you. This is your chance to make Titan history. Show everyone watching why women are unstoppable forces of nature. [dramatic music] [Liam] Emily in the red, Julie in the blue, and they're off and running and trying to attack that wall. [Alex] Let's see how they tackle the 1,000-pound wall. Julie Dudley tears it down. So impressive. But Emily not far behind. [Liam] They get to the Gates of Olympus. Julie's using all arms... but Emily's driving with her legs. [Alex] Digging her feet, putting it in those grooves, driving each 150-pound gate higher. [Liam] She's got all three of them off. [Alex] Julie Dudley, not there yet... But Emily is flying though... Oh, I spoke too soon! She was going through the Rolling Ascent very quickly, but it's tricky. It'll catch you out of nowhere, and before you know it, you're on the floor. [Liam] Still plenty of time for Julie to catch up, {\an7}but Emily has the early lead... Let's go! and now she's at The Cliffs. [Alex] Oh, and a front kick from the MMA fighter. Wow! Come on, Emily. And here comes Julie trying to stay low, but the log's spinning, and she's down. Emily, punching and kicking it halfway to the top. What twisted mind designed this course? [laughing] [Liam] Julie, meanwhile, having trouble getting far enough forward. Those logs are four feet wide. Come on, Babe! Pull yourself up! Come on! [Liam] One thing that Emily's not worried about is punching holes in that Cliff. With the MMA background, she's smashing through and climbing up. And Julie's through. Yeah! Come on! Get up there! Get up there! Let's go! [Alex] But Emily reaches the top. Now it's over to our next obstacle, where you've got to raise the torch. That's 600 pounds, more than four times her body weight. Let's go, Julie. [Liam] Julie's not out of this. She can catch up if she climbs up The Cliffs quickly. [Alex] Emily finds a second wind. Her torch is lit. And she's gonna start descending down Mount Olympus here as she hits those walls, five feet, six feet, seven feet. She's only 5'2", Liam. [Liam] Julie, still fighting. [Alex] Emily's approaching the Titan floor. Now, it's on to the Ball and Chain. But she's only 130 pounds. How's she gonna drag 200 pounds of metal? [Liam] Just like that. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! [Alex] Are you kidding me? Go! Go! All you got! [Alex] My goodness! She's reached the tomb! [Liam] Julie's now up top Mount Olympus trying to raise the torch, trying to finish strong, but right now, this one is all about Emily Andzulis. Come on, Emily. [Alex] Emily is a few swings away from breaking open the concrete in the Titan tomb. Glory is right in front of Emily Andzulis, a woman who's been a fighter her whole life. [Liam] She was inspired by her sister who survived cancer. Now she's the inspiration. [Dwayne] Come on. [Alex] The key is in, and Emily is our first female Titan. [inspirational music] [screaming] -Congratulations. -Thank you so much. You did it. You're amazing. Congratulations. [Alex] Emily took the lead at the gates of Mount Olympus and never looked back. She used her MMA skills at The Cliffs and her tremendous lower-body strength to drag the ball and chain and light up the mountain, [Liam] The Pit Bull proves why she's a Titan, and she's down with Cari. So, Emily, you got family watching, your sister specifically. Anything you want to say to her? Oh, God. Um... she's my person. She's been by my side every... through every obstacle, and I love her a lot, so... You made her proud tonight. Let's make this official. DJ, you have something for her? Come on up. Come on up. Come on. Here you go. You've earned our respect. Congratulations. You're a Titan. -Thank you so much! -Absolutely. -You did great. Great job. -Thank you. [Liam] So James and Emily are our first two Titans. Each week, we'll add two more. Then they'll all face off in the Battle of the Titans. In the end, we'll crown one man and one woman Titan Champions. More Titan Games to come right after this. New Titan. [Alex] That's right, DJ. We're just getting started. [dramatic music] Yes. -Hi, what's your name? -Zenia. Zenia? What a pretty name. I'm Kevin Hart. [laughter] It's good to meet you. Are you having fun tonight? -Mm-hmm. -Awesome. Who are you here to see? Are you here with a competitor, or are you here just to hang out and have the best time? Who are you here to see? Oh, to see me! Oh, my gosh! Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Have fun. Good to meet you. All right, let's get to work. [Liam] All right, DJ. We've got four men and four women prepared to face off in head-to-head battles. [Alex] We'll see three new epic challenges, and the winners will square off on Mount Olympus for the chance to be crowned Titans. [Liam] For a look at our first matchup, let's go over to Cari Champion. {\an7}All right, guys, so listen up. These next competitors are bringing both brains {\an7}and brawn to the competition. One's a high school sports star turned medical student. The other is, check this out, a satellite engineer who's also a killer athlete? Titan competitors come from all walks of life. Thong La is an aerospace mechanical engineer in Tampa, Florida. I'm able to work on things that go into space. I feel like I represent all the nerds behind the desk. [Cari] But some Titan hopefuls spend their days in disguise. I come to work, you know, dressed professional and then take this outfit off... put on a cut-off T-shirt, chalk up my hands. I'm a freaking beast. My fiancée, Shanny Lee, she'll do, like, powerlifting stuff with me. We're inseparable, so she's my soul mate. I want to show that I'm not just an engineer. I'm also an athlete. "There's no substitute for hard work." That's what The Rock always says. Everyone better watch out, 'cause I'll show them who the hardest worker in the room is. [Liam] Well, Thong will need to work overtime to beat his opponent. Quinn Rivera is a small-town star with big dreams. [Cari] Quinn Rivera comes from one of the smallest towns of any Titan competitor, Cody, Wyoming, population 9,000. I'm very much a small-town, homegrown type of person. My high school sweetheart grew up, actually, right around the block from me. We've been through a lot, baby girl, in nearly six years time, and it's helped me to see that I want you to be forever mine. We finally got married this past summer. I'm a medical student. To be a doctor, I guess, was kind of an early decision. I have two uncles and my grandfather who are all physicians. I think that's one of the most rewarding things you can do is to... just to give back. How are we today? I've always been kind of a small-town kid with big dreams. In high school I played football, and then I ran track in the spring. [Cari] Tonight, the pride of Cody, tests himself on the biggest stage of his life. It means a lot to be able to represent Cody on a competition of this scale. This is an opportunity of a lifetime. I will be a Titan. [Liam] So we have a medicine man and a rocket man. [Alex] The perfect pair to launch this next challenge. [Liam] Take it away, DJ. So I wanted this challenge to look like a crazy, old-school video game. I wanted our athletes to feel like they were kids testing the limits of their imaginations, but there's no extra lives on The Titan Games. You lose, it's game over. [Alex] DJ designed an absurd agility course testing lower-body power and forearm grip strength {\an7}as you use a giant silver pole {\an7}to span five 15-foot gaps. To free the golden pole, you must push off weight that's equivalent to three washing machines. {\an7}[Liam] Then showcase your speed by vaulting your way back, climb and reach for the victory chain that sends you to Mount Olympus. Quinn and Thong, you both came here with something to prove. The chance to shine is now. Time to fly. This is Power Vault. [dramatic music] [Liam] Thong in the blue. Quinn in the red. Thong, no hesitation at all. [Alex] And that's exactly what you need. You need to commit and just hope that you don't make the ultimate failure and fall. Come on, baby. [Alex] If your pole misses that tiny ring on the ground, you could take a dive ten feet down, and then kiss your Titan dreams goodbye. Come on! Come on! Let's go! [Liam] When Quinn was in high school, he excelled on the track, and it looks like that training is paying off. [Alex] They started with explosive speed. Now it's time for brute strength. Those blocks increase in weight, starting at 200 pounds, and that last one is 300 pounds. And Thong nearly trips over his silver pole. That could be the difference in the race. [Liam] This isn't just about upper-body strength. You need balance to land and keep moving. [Alex] Oh, Thong La just tripped for that brief moment. Let's go, boys. [Alex] Quinn needs to take advantage of this. [Liam] And he is. Quinn really finding his rhythm. [Alex] And Thong La... Lands knees first. He's really struggling. [Liam] One gap to go for Quinn Rivera. [Alex] After another fall, Thong is not giving up, but the medical student from Cody, Wyoming, population 9,000, is going to set the pole and begin the climb to the victory chain. [dramatic music] Yeah, boy! Wow! [Liam] Whoa, one final leap for Quinn Rivera back with his brothers in the stands. [Alex] The small-town star looks ready for the big stage. [Liam] We'll see Quinn later on Mount Olympus, fighting for his chance to be a Titan. Hey, man, I appreciate all you stand for, brother. Oh, absolutely, man. Great job. [dramatic music] [Alex] Dwayne Johnson! Again, you forgot to say I'm the sexiest man alive. That's okay. Whatever. Welcome to Titan Games. [cheers and applause] This crowd tonight. Titan Arena. Wow! [Alex] That was DJ earlier tonight. We've got the best hype man in the world, Liam. [Liam] You can feel that electricity right now. This crowd is ready, DJ. All right, seriously, we got to make a home version of Titan Games. I'm gonna ask NBC to recreate this entire setup in my backyard so I can knock these bad boys down. You know what, go ahead and take it out of Liam and Goldenboy's salary if you have to. They said that's cool. Right, boys? There's no way that that's gonna pay for any of that. Joke's on you. I'm not getting paid. Now time for our next Titan Games battle. I'll come up there, Goldenboy. All right, guys. So in this battle, one competitor is looking to make her mark in a family of athletes. The other is a former soldier turned fearless firefighter. I was 16 years old when my Mom cosigned me into the military. I was in this small town where if you didn't leave, you didn't do anything. I was this innocent, wide-eyed, naive Christian girl. I was scared, but it definitely made me the person that I am today. I'm currently a volunteer firefighter in Vermont. Being a firefighter, carrying 60 pounds of gear... going up flights of stairs, and, like, I have to be fit. [cell phone ringing] [Dwayne] Hey, Marianne? I'm a huge fan of Dwayne Johnson. -[laughs] -[laughing] [shudders] So I... I still can't believe I did this. And I muted him. I put him on hold. Could you just... just hold on one second? Holy crap! It's The Rock! Oh, my God. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. She fainted. Guys, Marianne fainted. [chuckles] -Okay, I'm good, I'm good. -Is this Marianne? Yep, hey. Hey, Marianne, first of all I just want to say... I want to thank you for your service to our country. You know, it speaks volumes, I think, of what you're gonna bring... Holy crap. I want to welcome you to The Titan Games. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dwayne Johnson wants me to be on The Titan Games, and I am the hungriest person in the room. I know I can be a Titan. [Liam] Marianne's confident she's going to be our next Titan, but her opponent comes in with something to prove. [Cari] Most of our competitors were stars on their sports teams, but Nikkie Neal had to fight just to stand out in her own family. I'm the youngest of my five siblings, so there's always that competition like, "You're my little sister. I'll always be better than you." I feel like my whole life I was always living up to my sisters's standards, kind of like in their shadows. -Are you tired? -Nah, I can keep going. -Okay. -[laughs] Until we kind of, like, went different routes in life. I'm actually a fitness model. People that look at me, they'll think that, "Oh, she's just a pretty face." Most people would not expect me to do well, but I surprise people usually. They're like, "Oh, wait. She's actually strong. Oh, she's fast, too!" I work out every single day. I'll do boxing. I'll do kickboxing, cycling. People don't think that fitness models are actually fit. I like to prove people wrong, and that's my reason to become stronger and become the next Titan. [Liam] Nikkie's family in the crowd tonight. Mom and big sister here to support her. [Alex] Now, L.A. is known for earthquakes, but on The Titan Games you have to watch out for the Cyclone. With this deranged test {\an7}of core strength and stability, you'll need to whip around a suspended 60-pound wrecking ball. The goal is to knock over all five pillars that are each nearly two stories tall. [Liam] The challenge is as the circumference {\an7}of the ball's path increases, {\an7}it will require even more {\an7}strength to maintain control, but whoever can wreak the most havoc makes the cut for Mount Olympus. I wanted my challenges to be an event, and this one does not disappoint with metal chains, giant pillars, and huge wrecking balls. It's intimidating, but that's why I made sure the people competing were fearless. Right now, two will enter the storm, but only one heads to Mount Olympus. Nikkie, Marianne, it's really simple. All I want is all you got. This is Cyclone. [dramatic music] [Liam] Under way, and it's about generating force, speed, power, and finding out how far you got to get that rope out there. Oh, Marianne just misses it. [Alex] You cannot go into this thinking that that wrecking ball is just going to gingerly find its way... Just as I say that, Nikkie manages to knock down the first pillar. She gets the second as well. She's tearing this apart. [Alex] Marianne gets her first pillar, but Nikkie answers right back with her third. Come on. [Liam] Nikkie Neal's 5'10". She's got long arms, and she's using it to her advantage here in the arena. [Alex] Keeping that ball flying wide means your shoulder and back muscles never get a break. The fourth one's down. Only one left to go, but she needs to get that ball moving again. [Liam] Marianne, coming up with her second pillar, but you see the rope go slack after it hits the pillar. Oh! [Alex] Oh. She barely missed that one, Liam, just by a hair, but she's coming around the corner. Here she comes. But misses again, and look, that's three for Marianne. She's catching up. [Liam] She's reeling in the slack line to keep tension on the wrecking ball. One more pillar and she's tied with Nikkie. [Alex] Another miss. Marianne's got a chance. And there it is! Nikkie Neal, unreal. She's one to watch here at The Titan Games. [cheers and applause] You're so good. You're so good. God, I'm so proud of you. You're marvelous. You're marvelous. [Liam] Hugs from the family. The fitness model one step closer to being a Titan. And a hug and embrace for her opponent. You did great. That was so hard. You were so good. [dramatic music] [Liam] Welcome back to The Titan Games. While we were away, Utah farmer Cole Wadsworth faced off against combat veteran David Reid on the Cyclone. [Alex] And Cole cuts another one down. [Liam] Reid, who lost his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, relied on his powerful torso, but this hero still had trouble keeping control of his wrecking ball. Ah, come on. Wadsworth, who's no stranger to ropes on his farm, found his rhythm. And with his family cheering him on... Go, Cole! Go! was the first to topple all five pillars. [triumphant music] Cole takes it home. Yes! I love you! [Alex] Cole Wadsworth, ladies and gentlemen, is going to Mount Olympus. Hey, good job, man. [Liam] So Cole Wadsworth will face Quinn Rivera on Mount Olympus, but we still need to find an opponent for Nikkie Neal. Let's take a look at the two women vying for the final spot on Mount Olympus. ♪ Pay attention ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm coming for you ♪ [Cari] Charity Witt is a world-class powerlifter who spends her days motivating others. Easy breaths. I am a master trainer and metabolic technician, and I help athletes fine-tune their training. We'll do that about ten times. [Cari] But Charity Witt is a woman transformed who overcame a major obstacle. At 17, I found I had cardiac arrhythmia. I started having mock heart attacks. It got to the point where I was actually in a meeting with my boss, and I passed out in front of her. The first doctor told me that I needed a pacemaker. I needed to go under surgery, be on medication for the rest of my life. I went to another doctor and got a second opinion, and they told me that I could avoid surgery... if I improved my health and treated my heart like a muscle. I realized this is just another way for me to prove how strong I am. ♪ I'm on the rise ♪ I went to school and got my degree in biochemistry. I became a U.S. master swimmer. That led me into powerlifting. Whoo! Within a year, I was competing. In my first ever competition, I broke a world record. Let's go! Whoo! Lifting saved my life. [Cari] Tonight, on The Titan Games, Charity is ready to show the world how far she's come. ♪ I'm on the rise ♪ This is an opportunity to just show my heart. ♪ I'm on the rise ♪ {\an7}[Liam] Charity's focused, and {\an7}she's got destiny on her side. That's her little sister. But don't underestimate the strength and courage of her competition, Mariah Counts. [Cari] Success on The Titan Games means being a well-rounded athlete, and Mariah Counts has done it all. I played volleyball and track and field. I did throwing, shot put, uh, discus, hammer, javelin. [Cari] Then she found CrossFit and transformed her body. When I train, I think about all the years I've ever done sports, I love performing under pressure. [Cari] Mariah spends all day in the gym as an elite personal trainer, and at night, she flexes another muscle as an aspiring singer-songwriter. ♪ Head to head And heart to heart ♪ ♪ Keep it together Don't fall apart ♪ Tonight, we'll see if her unrelenting drive pays off. I'm really determined to win this thing. I want to go out there and kill it, and I want to become a Titan. ♪ You can laugh at me You can call me names ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be On The Titan Games ♪ [cheers and applause] And that's for you, Dwayne. {\an7}[Liam] In the NFL, they judge players by their time in the 40-yard dash. On The Titan Games, we only need 30 feet. [Alex] That's right, Liam. the pain meter {\an7}on this challenge goes to 11. {\an7}Let's crank up some Heavy Metal. [Liam] DJ engineered a challenge that requires your glutes, hamstrings, quads, and willpower to all be in sync as you lug 350 pounds of chain 30 feet uphill. [Alex] With every step, the chain uncoils from the ground, making the load heavier the higher you go. At the top, you must use your upper body to turn a crank and lift the remaining chain {\an7}plus a 100-pound concrete block three stories high. [Liam] Complete this insanity first, and you're headed to Mount Olympus. Sometimes life can feel like an uphill battle, which is why I designed this next challenge to represent that... both figuratively and literally... but a Titan has the strength to keep going even when that path is steep. So, Charity and Mariah, the path doesn't get much steeper than this, but the opportunity that awaits you on the other side makes it all worthwhile. This is Heavy Metal. [dramatic music] [Liam] Charity Witt the blue, Mariah Counts in the red. 30-foot ramp, and you're lifting more chain with each step. Every foot they move puts ten more pounds on their back. [Alex] Imagine carrying a refrigerator up a mountain and every step, someone throws a ten-pound weight on to make it harder. Push through! [Dwayne] Let's go, ladies! Let's go. Let's go! [Liam] You want know how hard this is? Charity Witt, {\an7}world record holder in squat, dead lift, and it is baby steps. You think you're stable, but when you start to move, the weight increases, and suddenly you're off balance. [Alex] Oh, man, and then Mariah, she can squat 285 pounds. This woman is a monster. But Charity Witt manages to make it all the way up to the top. Now she's got to place the bar into the crank and start cranking with her entire body. [Liam] It's time to turn and burn for Charity Witt. They blasted their legs on the way up. Now it's all about the arms and back. Heavy Metal is a full-body beat-down. [Alex] And Mariah sees that Charity is already ahead of her. Come on, babe! Let's go! And with Daniella cheering her on, Mariah makes it to the top. Good job. [Liam] Charity has a head start here, but Mariah's still in this. She knows every crank gets her one step closer to Mount Olympus. [Alex] You're not just winding the chain. Those blocks at the bottom weigh 100 pounds. And there you see Charity's concrete block starting to rise. Another 15 feet, and she's headed to Mount Olympus. [Liam] This is literal head-to-head competition. [Alex] And now Mariah finally gets her concrete block off the ground, but Charity is so close. Go! And she does it! Charity Witt is your winner. [Liam] Strength and then endurance and the heart of a champion with Charity Witt. [Alex] Charity used her powerful legs to charge to the top, then threw her whole body into the crank. [Liam] And her heart, once considered a weakness, proved to be her strongest weapon. {\an7}So Charity Witt will face off with Nikkie Neal for the Titan crown. Those crowned as Titans tonight can soak in the glory for a little while, but they'll all return here to compete against our other winners in the epic Battle of the Titans. One woman and one man will be crowned Titan Champions. Now two athletes who just took down their strong opponents face the mountain of madness. They've shown incredible courage in their lives just to get here, turning doubters into believers. It's Nikkie Neal versus the powerlifter, Charity Witt. The edge I have over Nikkie is that I'm just strong. {\an7}Like there is probably nothing in Mount Olympus that I couldn't overpower. [Alex] Charity Witt is your winner. Charity's a badass. She can dead lift, like, 500 pounds, and that's insane. Where I have an advantage is I'm quicker and I'm more agile than she is. [Alex] Nikkie Neal, unreal. It's gonna be a battle. I am so impressed by these two unbelievably strong women. Nikkie, Charity, Mount Olympus doesn't care what gender you are. It'll use everything in its power to stop you, but you need to push past that and give it everything you've got. It's time to electrify the Titan Arena. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Nikkie in the red, Charity in the blue racing to the 1,000-pound wall. [Alex] There's that power. Upper-body strength from Charity Witt. That is gonna give her a little bit of a lead there. [Liam] But Nikkie Neal also takes it down. Let's go, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, Nik! Good job. [Alex] And Charity just destroys the Gates of Mount Olympus. [Liam] But now her agility will be tested. And right away, she's struggling. You want to stay on top of those rollers and keep your feet moving. [Alex] This is where Nikkie needs to take the lead, but she's not faring much better than Charity. The rollers would be tough enough on level ground, but you're moving uphill. Gravity wants you rolling back. [Liam] And there goes Nikkie. Look at that footwork. She has the lead heading into The Cliffs. There you go! There you go! There you go! [Liam] First, she needs to punch and kick a road to the top. And Charity has caught up. She's here to prove there's no quit in Witt. There you go. Punch that wall, ladies. [Liam] This is strategy as much as it is toughness. [Alex] You have to have a plan on The Cliffs or else you could potentially fall off. Nikkie Neal needs to establish another hole so she can jump up. She uses her right leg to do that. But Charity makes it up The Cliffs first. She has a slight lead over Nikkie. [Liam] Now they're both on the torch. Charity into it. This should be a strength for her. [Alex] We know that the upper-body strength of Charity Witt was something that she was highlighting coming into The Titan Games. This is where you've got to put it all to use. This is now a neck-and-neck race. Who is gonna go down Mount Olympus first? Absolutely mind-blowing. The fitness model is outcranking the powerlifter. Nikkie Neal, despite Charity having the upper-body strength, she manages to raise the torch first! Go! Go! Go! [Liam] Nikkie Neal back in the lead. Wow, let's go! Get down to me! [Liam] A shocking turn, and she's headed down first. [Alex] They're separated by only a few feet as they descend down the mountain. This is awesome. And look at Charity. She looks exhausted, hanging her head as she slides down the mountain, but she continues to fight. Mount Olympus is not a sprint. It's one mean marathon. Come on! You can do it! Let's go! [Liam] They're both at that third and final wall heading to the floor. Nikkie Neal the first one there, and again, strength beats strategy. [Alex] She's got to start pulling now. You know that the upper-body strength of Charity Witt is going to shine on the Ball and Chain, and Charity Witt just has to get a handle on it. And look at that! Just one arm! Just one arm was all she needed! Nikkie had that lead, and she got down Mount Olympus first, but it doesn't matter that you were faster down the mountain. All that matters is that you're pulling that boulder with everything you got. [Nikkie] Ahh! Come on, Nikkie. [groans] [Liam] Listen to that determination, Nikkie willing herself to that Titan tomb. Come on. Come on! [Liam] She's come too far to quit now. [Alex] Charity does look a little gassed, but Nikkie Neal has to hurry up. Come on, Nikkie. Can Charity manage to make a hole big enough so that she can claw through it with her bare hands and get out that relic from the Titan tomb? But Nikkie Neal now, does she have it in her? Does she have the energy to break through the cement quickly enough? [Liam] Can Nikkie Neal make one last push here? [Alex] You have to just dig as deep as you possibly can. The title of Titan is right in front of you, but Charity Witt, she has the relic in her hands, and she's gonna run up the steps. Charity Witt, the powerlifter... she is a Titan. [inspirational music] [cheering] Let me get that off for you. Let me get that off for you. Congratulations. You did it. Great job. Great job. Good job. Girl, I thought you had it. I thought you had it. Good job. You did good. [Alex] What a race. Charity's power put her ahead early, but Nikkie used her long legs and surprising upper-body strength to blow past her and beat Charity to the arena floor. [Liam] But then you got to the Ball and Chain, and that's where it all changed. [Alex] One arm! Just an incredible display of power in Charity Witt, the powerlifter who battled through a heart condition. Tonight, she's a Titan. [Liam] And she's standing by with Cari. Charity, anything you want to say to folks at home? {\an7}Yeah. I mean, I was told that {\an7}I needed to be on medication, have open-heart surgery, {\an7}and I didn't listen to them, and I kept fighting. Just like Mount Olympus, fought through that. So the message to all of you guys, just listen to your own heart, and keep fighting. Here you go. You have earned this. Congratulations. You're a Titan. Thank you so much. That was an amazing performance. -Thank you. -I'm so proud of you. We are gonna be crowning another Titan right after this. Stay with us. Amazing. [dramatic music] [Alex] Welcome back to the spectacular Titan Arena. It's time for our thrilling final battle. Bring it, DJ. Now we've got two competitors who are chomping at the bit to take down the mountain and become a Titan. Both of these competitors are ambitious, aggressive, and defy expectations. It's Quinn Rivera versus Cole Wadsworth. My edge over Quinn is probably just the fact that I train, specifically functional type training, balance, agility, but there's just things that you can't replicate when you're inside of a gym. On the farm, I spend a lot of time throwing hay or swinging a sledgehammer, just all the physical work that keeps you in such great shape. Got to stay focused and win this thing. -Well, you're going to. -My wife is amazing. When we're working out together, we're always just pushing each other to kind of hit that next limit, which is why we're both so competitive. I have two beautiful daughters, Giselle who's five and Veda, who is almost a year old now. My daddy's a superhero. I want to compete in The Titan Games for my family and also for myself. I want to take this amazing opportunity and prove to people that to become a Titan, you have to be farmer strong. One of the things that I really will lean on is my athletic background and my ability to really push through the hurt. Mount Olympus is gonna take everything I have tonight, and I promise that I will leave nothing out on the course. [dramatic music] You can feel the electricity in Titan Arena. The crowd is ready. These two men are tremendous athletes with incredible agility. They're both small-town guys who made a very big impact in this competition so far. Quinn, Cole, you only get one shot at this, so lay it all out on the line, and grit it out. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Quinn in the red, Cole in the blue, and they're off. [Alex] Looking forward to seeing how these two men are gonna tackle the 1,000-pound wa... Never mind. I should have just stopped talking at that moment there, Liam, because they're flying right through this. [Liam] Look at that power, driving 450 pounds uphill. [Alex] The Gates of Olympus are no challenge for them as well? What is going on here?! Quinn Rivera is flying through the rolling assent. Cole Wadsworth is right there. Oh, my goodness, Liam! They are flying up Mount Olympus! Wow, look at this. Go! Come on. Let's go, boys! Get up that wall. [Alex] And Cole's using his upper-body strength to get up The Cliffs, and he takes the first lead. Oh! He takes a spill. Quickly, though, back on his feet, and Quinn reaches the top right behind him. [Liam] And these two men are neck and neck, as they race to raise their torches. -Go, Daddy! Go! -Dad! [dramatic music] [Alex] Those torches are 600 pounds. It's like reeling in a full-grown grizzly bear. And here comes Quinn. They both raise the torch at the same time. Get down to me, boys. Yes! What is going on here, Liam? They are just flying. They are just tumbling over Mount Olympus. -[Liam] Head over heels. -It's like an avalanche going down, and they are amazing! Come on, Quinn! Come on, Q! [Liam] Now, both men are at the Ball and Chain. Get a good grip, and get going, and that's what Quinn's doing. Let's go, boys! [Alex] It has been a close, close race here. Quinn reaches the tomb first, but his hammer, his hammer doesn't reach. Cole Wadsworth, he's gonna he hacking first. Quinn Rivera has to hurry up. [Liam] He's got to start hammering away. [Alex] He just didn't have enough... enough stretch on that chain. Come on, Quinn! Get going! [Liam] Cole still looking for the relic, and Quinn is desperately trying to break through, and he's in. [Alex] Who will find the relic first? Cole Wadsworth, he's grabbed it. He's grabbed the relic! From Draper, Utah, Cole Wadsworth is putting them on the map, 'cause he's a Titan. -Farm strong, Titan strong. -[Alex] Wow. [triumphant music] Yes! Great job, brother. -Thank you. -Great job. [Alex] Mount Olympus will test your heart and challenge your spirit. Both Cole Wadsworth and Quinn Rivera, they were ready, but only one of them continues in this competition. Good freakin' job, man. Good job, brother. Good job, brother. [Liam] That was a hair-on-fire sprint. [Alex] You couldn't have asked for a better matchup. Side by side, up and down mighty Mount Olympus. We just witnessed one of the great ones. I knew you could do it. I knew you could do it. [Liam] Tears of joy. Daddy is a Titan, and that's something to celebrate. So we crowned our first four Titans tonight. We'll see them all in a few weeks for the epic Battle of the Titans, and in the end, we'll crown one man and one woman our Titan Champions. -Thanks, man. -Great job. We'll see you next week on Titans. Cole's the man. [laughs] [dramatic music]
