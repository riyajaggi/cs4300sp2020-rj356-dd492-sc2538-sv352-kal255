After weeks of grueling competition, 5,000 pounds of concrete broken, four gallons of sweat and tears, {\an7}plus the 18 bottles of tequila {\an7}I personally downed backstage. [laughter] I'm only kidding. Four bottles, tops. It all comes down to this. Helping me out tonight, as she has all season long, my one and only, Cari Champion. [dramatic music] Thank you, DJ. How are you? You're welcome. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. You look good. -You, too. -Thank you. [Dwayne] So, here we go. [all] Let the Battle of the Titans begin! [dramatic music] [Cari] In our very first Titan versus Titan matchup, this heavyweight battle is the combat veteran {\an7}and the Purple Heart recipient from San Antonio, Christopher Watts, going up against the Miami truck driver, and the family man, James Jean-Louis. [dramatic music] Budweiser deliveryman James Jean-Louis's incredible performance seven weeks ago blew our minds. The Haitian Sensation. [Cari] And his celebration captured our hearts. The feeling that came upon me when I first won, and holding my son in my arms, was overwhelming. I love you, man. [soft music] The tears on Semaj's face and the smile that he had, that right there is my fuel. [dramatic music] [Cari] After an arrest at 23, this single father turned his life around, setting a positive example for his son. And his tireless work ethic has him on the verge of making history. It's you versus you! Go get it! Going into Battle of the Titans, I know that I need to stay focused. It's the best of the best, and if I don't give my all, I will be going home early. I mean, it's all on how bad you want it. And when you want it bad, you got to train for it. No days off. A couple of weeks ago, I was just a regular guy, driving trucks. Now I'm proof that second chances are absolutely real. I came here through pain, through tears, through stress. Failure is not an option. I need to be the Champion. [dramatic music] [Cari] Christopher Watts's victories in the Titan Arena were inspired by the tragedies he's suffered. [somber music] I have experienced losses, uh, both in the Army and civilian side. [thunder rumbling] I lost a great platoon sergeant, James Doster, who was a phenomenal person. And then I lost my Dad to brain cancer. Just knowing I have this opportunity, I'm grateful that I'm here. And every time I do something, I use them to help fuel me and get me through. [Cari] But Christopher isn't alone. The Titan Games reunited him with his Mom, Betty, who he hadn't seen in two years. Nice job! Go, Chris! -Whoo! -Seeing my mother out there in the crowd definitely keeps me centered, and also fuels me to take on every challenge -that Dwayne throws at me. -I love you. I will become a Titan Champion, and make my Mom proud. [Liam] So this is our first of eight Titan-versus-Titan matchups. By the end of the night, four men and four women will be advancing to the Titan Championship next week. Hello, everyone. I'm Liam McHugh, here in the skybox with my partner, Alex "Goldenboy" Mendez. James and Christopher are both a couple of heavy hitters, so we found them the perfect challenge. Stand back for Atlas Smash. I love this challenge. Atlas was an ancient god who carried the entire world on his shoulders, and these two competitors have both carried their share of burdens. But now they meet in the field of battle with Titan glory on the horizon. James, Christopher, there are no secrets here. This is all on you. This is Atlas Smash. [dramatic music] [Liam] James in the gold. Chris in the silver. Both of them pick up that hammer and start swinging away. [Alex] Here we go, partner! I love Atlas Smash! [both grunting] Come on! You got this! You got this, son! [grunts] [Alex] Look, you have to keep chipping away concrete until those 350-pound stones are light enough to lift. [grunts] [Liam] And it's interesting to see how they're attacking this Atlas stone. Both of them moving around it, trying to chip away on all sides of the stone and start some cracks forming. Such a smart move. [grunts] [Alex] Oh, my goodness. What is going on? James Jean-Louis! We've never seen anyone throw down like this on Atlas Smash. [Dwayne laughs] Wow! [Liam] And yeah, no problem raising that first stone. [Alex] Yeah, that's because there's barely a chunk of concrete left. [grunts] [Liam] James already has his first stone up. Oh, yeah! [grunts] On the other side, Chris is going to try to lift. [Alex] But there's a lot of stone left there, Liam. Nope. And it's not going to happen. [Liam] James Jean-Louis, on to the second stone. [Alex] And the Budweiser deliveryman is taking his favorite route again. He's going around the circumference, knocking away that stone. [grunts] Chris needs to make up some ground here. This is a combat vet with a Purple Heart. He's not in the quitting business. [Liam] Meanwhile, James Jean-Louis is starting to slow down. [dramatic music] [grunts] Chris giving it another go here. [Alex] Christopher Watts, this man has fought through so much in his life. Come on, Chris! [both grunting] [James] Come on! [Liam] Wow, James is getting a second wind. [grunts] Break! Let's go! Let's go! James Jean-Louis is just a monster! He is destroying that stone! [grunts] [Liam] Chris, almost there. [grunts] -And he locks it in. -Come on! There you go! Come on! [Liam] Chris has one stone up, but at this point, it looks like it is way too late. Let's go, Chris. Come on, Chris. Come on, James. [Liam] James Jean-Louis makes the slow walk over to the rope. Can he pull this up? [grunts] 25 feet to the top, and James will be heading to the Titan Championship. Whoa! [grunts] [Alex] A single dad! A working man! And once again, your winner here at the Atlas Smash, domination. [Liam] One week, you're driving a truck for Budweiser. The next, you're going to the Titan Championship. God. My goodness. I love you. -Oh! -I love you. [dramatic music] -Ahh! -I'm proud of you, baby. -I love you. -I love you too. -Congratulations, brother. -Thank you. -Way to represent. -Thank you. -305. -All day. -All day. -All day. Good job. You're on your way to the Titan Championship. Thank you. [Liam] The Battle of the Titans is under way. Eight men and eight women are competing, and only four will advance to the championship next week. Now our first two women are ready to square off. -Cari. {\an7}-In this next Titan battle, it's the horse whisperer {\an7}who makes a very loud statement in this arena, Christiana Rugloski, versus the engineer who comes from a long line of brilliant and very strong women, Nika Sedghi. Nika Sedghi isn't interested in conforming to stereotypes. I've always been the girl, the tomboy that wants to fix up anything around the house, and the LEGO set was way cooler than the Barbie set. I'm a full-time mechanical engineer, and what we do is we work on gas turbine engine design. The line of resilient women that I come from is what I'm most proud of. Take a look at this picture. That's your heritage, from Grandma, back from Iran. We're proud people. [dramatic music] [Cari] With lessons learned from strong role models, Nika Sedghi is ready to do battle once again in the Titan Arena. When women in my family set a goal, we always accomplish it. I'm a Titan now, but I will become a Titan Champion. [soft music] At 21, Christiana Rugloski is the youngest competitor in the Battle of the Titans. [grunts] And remarkably, she's only been a competitive athlete for a few years. I grew up in an ultra-conservative family and community, and the goal for us girls was to get married and have kids. But then, when I was 17, everything kind of changed. I was on the scene of a car accident. The car flipped over into the water, and I was able to help with saving the mother and two of her children, but two of them passed away. [somber music] I spent the night with the two little boys that were able to get out, and they were... you know, asking for their older sister, asking for their Mom, and... we... you know, we didn't know until a couple hours later what had actually happened. It was a huge eye-opening experience for me. It really gave me a whole new appreciation in the shortness of life. And like, what do I want out of life, and what do I want to be remembered for? Good job. [Cari] Christiana took her dream job at an equine therapy ranch helping people with special needs, and pursued another passion, entering obstacle course races and ultramarathons. Now, just three years later and against all odds, this underdog has nearly reached the Titan Championship. I'm the girl that is never going to stop. I want to fully live and enjoy every moment that I possibly can. I know I have what it takes to become the Titan Champion. [dramatic music] [Liam] For their challenge, Christiana and Nika will have to whip around a 60-pound wrecking ball and take down five towering pillars. [Alex] Time to run for cover from the Cyclone. DJ. Christiana, Nika, if you listened to others, you wouldn't be here right now. Instead, you made yourselves into incredible athletes. The power, as always, is in your own two hands. This is Cyclone. [dramatic music] [Liam] Nika in the gold. Christiana in the silver. Here it is, Cyclone. The winner goes to the Titan Championship. [Alex] Christina surprised us all getting this far, {\an7}but she'll have a real test {\an7}tonight against Nika's power. Let's go, ladies. Let's go. [Liam] The trick is you're trying to swing the ball out wide and keep tension on the rope, and that kills your core. [Alex] Christiana knocks down the first pillar! Look at that smile. [cheers and applause] [grunts] But Nika is right behind her. [dramatic music] Go, Nika! Come on. [grunts] And Nika manages to get her second one down. Come on, Nika! [grunts] And now Christiana connects. [Dwayne] Bang! Let's go! [Liam] So Christiana evens it up at two. Whoever wins heads to the Titan Championship. The other is heading home. [Alex] But Nika's lining up her third. Oh, just nicked it! She has to come around again. [grunts] [Liam] Oh, but it's Christiana who cuts down number three. Goldenboy, she just took the lead. [cheers and applause] [Alex] She keeps on surprising us! -And Nika gets number three. -Whoo! But she lost all tension on her rope. Two more pillars to go. What?! Christiana, she knocks down her fourth! Can the horse whisperer upset the engineer here in the Titan Arena? [cheers and applause] One more! [grunts] [Liam] Now Nika answers. It's four to four, the closest match we've ever had on the Cyclone. One more! Come on, Nika! [Alex] They're both coming around. It's a shootout! It's a shootout! But Christiana, she's going to win! The girl from Lake Jackson, Texas, takes the W! She's moving on to the Titan Championship. [Liam] And she heads right over to celebrate with her brothers. Yeah! -I love you! -Oh, I love you, too! -I love you -So much fun, Mama. [laughs] Congratulations. What a performance. -So, so proud of you. -Thank you. Thank you so much. All right. [Liam] Welcome back to the Battle of the Titans. While we were away, Brad Schaeffer, a foot surgeon from New Jersey, faced off with Air Force sergeant Tyler Lucas. Tyler's big brother, Kyle, also competed on The Titan Games, but didn't advance... {\an7}-Hey, have fun out there, bro! -so he was back in the stands cheering for his sibling. These Titans took their turn on the Cyclone. The good doctor took the lead when he took down his third pillar. [dramatic music] [Alex] Brad Schaeffer has already knocked down another pillar! [Liam] But then he lost momentum and control of his rope. [Alex] Brad Schaeffer can't seem to get it going on that fourth pillar. [Liam] So Tyler, who flew here from Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, was able to whip up a comeback. There we go! Keep it going! He took down the third... fourth... -[Alex] This is unreal! -and final pillar to seal the win. There it is. [Alex] Tyler Lucas is not to be sent home today! -Whoo! -Let's go, baby! -Let's go! -Let's go! -Let's go, baby! -Let's go! [Liam] Tyler is our third athlete to move on to the Titan Championship next week. Now it's time for the challenge all of our competitors fear, Lunar Impact. [Alex] It's a race up a three-story ladder, and then you have to push your opponent off a crescent-shaped bridge 30 feet in the air. {\an7}[Liam] And tonight in the gold is a massage therapist and martial artist from Tennessee who goes by the nickname Pitbull. Emily Andzulis is a 5'2" black belt who regularly defeats guys twice her size in her local gym, and she's proven yet again here at The Titan Games that size doesn't matter. [Alex] And Emily has her sister, Sharon, who survived bone cancer, in her corner tonight. Let's go! [Liam] Emily's opponent, {\an7}Texas swim coach Jackie Wood, {\an7}came to the Titan Arena hoping {\an7}to make her students proud. -Good luck, coach Jackie! -Let's go, Jackie. After struggling with self-doubt her entire life, Jackie's victories have given her a new outlook. This morning when I woke up, I said to myself, "There is no more self-doubt. "Like, you have to just have confidence. "You've come this far in the competition. "Why continue to doubt yourself? You can do this." [Liam] And as always, Jackie's parents {\an7}are here to cheer her on. DJ. Jackie and Emily, here's the bottom line. When this is over, one of you is heading to the Titan Championship. The other is headed off the side of that platform. It's time to get to work. This is Lunar Impact. [dramatic music] [Liam] Emily on the right. Jackie on the left. How quickly can you make it 30 feet up that ladder? {\an7}[Alex] Whoever reaches that {\an7}wall first and starts pushing has a clear edge. Coach Jackie manages to get there first. [Liam] Jackie's already in a full sprint. Emily better move. [dramatic music] [Alex] Emily Andzulis has to brace for impact here, Liam. -[grunts] -Oh, man! She just smacked against that wall. So much force! Emily's upper body can't help her here until she locks her feet in place. [Liam] She doesn't have a grip. [Alex] Look at the power! Look at the power of coach Jackie Wood! [grunts] [dramatic music] [yells] [cheers and applause] [Alex] Oh, my word, she is going to the Titan Championship! Wow! -That was so awesome. -Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yeah! [Alex] Look at the force Jackie generates with that wall. {\an7}It hits Emily like a truck. {\an7}The Pitbull tried to get low, but she just couldn't slow Jackie's roll. [yells] Jackie, that was complete domination. Wow. I always doubt myself. I really do. And before every competition, I'm in my head all the time. And every challenge, I just keep proving myself wrong, that I can do this. So for all those watching at home that doubt themselves, you can do it. That's it. Congratulations, my friend. You are headed to The Titan Championship. Thank you so much. [Liam] So that means swim coach Jackie Wood will face off with the youngest athlete in the competition, 21-year-old Christiana Rugloski, next week in the Titan Championship. [dramatic music] Our Titans are facing off in some of the most grueling and most insane challenges ever created, and they wouldn't have it any other way. Look, they may scream, sweat, or cry out in pain, but trust me, they are loving this. Why? Because pain is temporary, and becoming the very first Titan Champion will live with them forever. So let's get to it. [dramatic music] [Liam] On the starting line, we have two fierce athletes. Jess Griffith is a former trauma nurse from Missouri who became a warrior {\an7}for proper diet and exercise. Jess doesn't just talk the talk. She spends 30 hours each week in the gym honing her body into {\an7}an elite CrossFit competitor. [Alex] And Jess is about to clash with one tough cop from North Carolina. Ashley Hawkins is a third-generation police officer. Ashley says, "On the streets, the stronger you are, the safer you are." Sometimes, being in law enforcement, females can be underestimated. But if you go out there and prove yourself like I have, you're going to get respect for that. [Liam] Jess and Ashley will be the first two women this season to throw down on Atlas Smash. [Alex] And whoever raises those two 350-pound stones goes to the Championship. The other goes home. DJ, this should be great. Jess and Ashley, you've made it this far, and I'm so proud of you both. But your future in this competition {\an7}depends on what happens next. Keep swinging and smashing, swinging and smashing, and pull, pull, pull. And just when you think you don't have anything left in the tank, pull again. This is Atlas Smash. [dramatic music] [Liam] Ashley in the gold. Jess in the silver. They're off and running and smashing those 350-pound stones. [dramatic music] [Alex] Well, you have to have a strategy at this point, Liam, and it looks like they're both taking a page from the James Jean-Louis playbook {\an7}we saw earlier on Atlas Smash. {\an7}[Alex] You see Jess and Ashley moving around the stone and hoping to just crack it in different areas so eventually, a large chunk will fall off. -Good job, Ashley! -Whoo! [Alex] Look at what Ashley is doing to that stone. She has managed to hack away at it so much. [dramatic music] [Liam] They have the physical strength. They also have the mental focus. Ashley, a cop, Jess, a former level-one trauma nurse. [grunts] Two women who know, when the pressure is on, they will keep their nerve and continue to get the job done. Let's go, Jess. Let's go, Ashley. [both grunting] [Alex] And Jess ready to lift. But did she knock enough off? [grunts] Yeah, I don't think so. That's a very heavy stone. It started at 350 pounds. And oh, my! Look at the swings from Jess Griffith! [grunts] [Liam] Such impressive power. [Alex] And now Ashley's going to give it a shot. Can she get it moving? [dramatic music] Oh, she's gonna climb up. [grunts] And no. Still not light enough. [Liam] Yeah, well, it still must weigh twice what she does. That's all right. that's all right. Two more swings! two more swings! [grunts] [Alex] Jess Griffith took a massive chunk. Oh, there goes another one! These women have no quit. No quit. [Alex] And you have to imagine that their arms are burning. Ashley Hawkins has had enough of this. She's going to go and try again, and Jess is right behind. [dramatic music] [grunts] -Whoa! -[Liam] It's going now. -Yeah! -[Alex] There you go! The stones are finally rising, both using their body weight to pull the rope down. [grunts] [grunts] Come on! Come on! [Alex] Jess Griffith is so close. [grunts] Ashley Hawkins, she's so close. [Liam] And Ashley hits the lever. So does Jess. They both get their stone up at almost the same time. This is anyone's match. It's all you, Ash! [Alex] But I got some bad news. You thought round one was hard, round two is going to be even harder. You're starting with a fresh Atlas stone. Every swing feels heavier than the last. And it's not necessarily about physical endurance, but mental endurance. [Liam] Ashley says she trains her mind more than she trains physically, because the mind is the ultimate powerhouse. [both grunting] Both ladies, they're not hitting as often, but every stroke is still packed with power. This competition is incredible. I've never seen anything like this. Ashley and Jess have no quit in them. It's really an amazing and inspiring moment, what's happening right here. [grunts] [dramatic music] [Liam] Both of these women absolutely exhausted, running on fumes right now. [Alex] How are they still going? This is superhuman, Liam. [Liam] Ashley Hawkins, the proud police officer. So many law enforcement officials have come here to support her. They are keeping her going right at this moment when she is so fatigued, it is just tough to lift that hammer. [Alex] A blast from Ashley! [Liam] And now Jess responds. Back and forth they go. It is blow for blow. [both grunting] [Alex] And Ashley Hawkins, she looks spent, Liam. I'm going down there, boys. [Liam] And you know what? If you're spent, if you're looking for a little bit of inspiration, well, here comes Dwayne Johnson right up there. Let's go. Come on. Let's go, Jess. -[Alex] That's right. -Let's go. What more inspiration do you need than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson? Let's go, Jess. [grunts] Good. Come on. Come on. Good. [Alex] Sees Jess Griffith, and now goes over to Ashley Hawkins. -Let's go, Ash. -Has to be a symbol -to just keep going. -Come on, Ash. Come on. There you go. [Liam] It's just a little shot of energy. There you go. There you go. [Liam] And Jess wants to finish this, but has she chipped away enough? Come on, Ash. [Alex] This could be it, Liam. She manages to lift it up! She manages to lift it up! Jess Griffith is right there! Halfway, almost to the top! This could be it! Right there! Jess Griffith is your winner! [Liam] What a battle! Jess Griffith is going to the Titan Championship. -[Alex] That was unreal. -Amazing job. You survived it. That was awesome. -Oh, my God. -You did awesome. -Great job. -Wow. [dramatic music] [Liam] A tough loss for Ashley Hawkins, but after that performance, this cop has definitely earned our respect tonight. Don't cry. You did great. You should be proud of where you came from and what you've done. -Oh, my God. -I'm awesome. -So proud of you. -Oh, thanks. -Congratulations. -Thank you. [Alex] And that means Jess Griffith will be back next week for her shot to become the Titan Champion. [dramatic music] There it is, Herculean Pull. It combines physical endurance with mental toughness. Now, we can see both competitors, but they can't see each other. This is so much fun to watch, and here's the thing. If I were President of the United States, this is how all elections would be decided. [cheers and applause] [Liam] Well, tonight, it's going to decide who moves on to the Titan Championship. Up first, the men. Bridger Buckley is {\an7}a 22-year-old college student and former linebacker at Washington State University. Bridger battled back after a near-fatal car wreck, and now trains five hours every day to pack muscle onto his impressive 220-pound frame. I know that I'm capable of great things and that I can become the next Titan Champion. [Alex] Bridger has serious power, but his opponent has world-class speed. Former NFL wide receiver, Florida's DJ Townsel, has a more peaceful profession these days. He's a yoga master. I'm using the breath, strength, agility, speed, athleticism, and a good namaste if I need to to become Titan Champion. [Liam] Now let's see which of these football players can score a spot in the Titan Championship. DJ, Bridger, you both have visions of Titan glory, so right now, you need to pull with power, pull with speed, and don't let go. This is Herculean Pull. [dramatic music] [Liam] Bridger Buckley in the gold, DJ Townsel in the silver. [Alex] You have to pull out two silver poles. Then it's a tug of war on the golden pole. [grunts] Both have one out quickly. One more, and they can go for the gold. [both grunting] Bridger is heading for the golden pole! [Liam] Wow, and it's Bridger who's bringing the speed instead of DJ. [Alex] Can DJ Townsel get a grip on this one? Go, Bridger! Go! [grunts] Don't let go, DJ! Hold, DJ! Hold! [both grunting] [dramatic music] [Alex] Oh! [Liam] Bridger Buckley is for real! -Whoo! -Yeah, baby! [breathing heavily] [Alex] The college student is moving on. [shouting] [Alex] We knew Bridger was strong, but tonight, he showed us his speed. {\an7}He beat DJ to the golden pole by only a second, but that was all it took for him to get the edge and the win. [dramatic music] -That was nice, boy. -Thank you. Bro, you got there fast. [Liam] So Bridger Buckley is moving on to the Titan Championship, and he'll be facing another beast... Budweiser deliveryman James Jean-Louis. But right now, the women will take their shot on the Herculean Pull. Cari. Our next battle is between two Titans who powered through dangerous medical conditions and transformed into unbelievable athletes. It's the Atlanta powerlifter Charity Witt going up against the martial arts expert from New Jersey, Kara Lazauskas. [dramatic music] Kara Lazauskas has spent a lifetime defying the odds. After having a lung removed as a toddler, doctors told her she'd never be an athlete. Now, at 27, she's run eight half-marathons, played college basketball, and fights MMA. She's dedicated her life to medical research and proving people wrong. I've overcome every single person who has told me I cannot be who I am. I've shown them all that I'm not going to live my life that way. Let's go! I want to be a Titan Champion so badly, that it's as bad as I want to breathe. [dramatic music] [Cari] Charity Witt has had her own physical limitations to overcome. Diagnosed at 17 with a heart condition, she refused to accept defeat... becoming an elite powerlifter with six world records. Now she has her eyes on a bigger prize. I've learned that my body is capable of more than what I think it is. [Alex] And look at that! Just one arm! I don't quit when I'm tired, I quit when I'm done, and I'm not done until I'm the Titan Champion. These two Titans have proved that when it comes to achieving their goals, nothing gets in their way. Now the only thing standing between them and the Titan Championship is each other. Charity, Kara, there is only one way of winning this. Grit it out. This is Herculean Pull. [dramatic music] {\an7}[Liam] Charity in the silver. Kara in the gold. {\an7}They start on opposite sides. [both grunting] [Alex] Charity makes {\an7}quick work of that first pole {\an7}and jumps right to the second. But Kara's right there! [grunts] [Liam] And look at the power from Charity Witt. -The second pole is out. -[Alex] Oh, my! Charity is heading up! Kara, she needs to lift before she pulls. Charity Witt's going to get a grip on the golden pole. Charity's getting a free ride. Kara's got to move! [both grunting] Charity Witt has dominated the Herculean Pull! [Liam] Charity Witt stuns the MMA fighter. She is on to the Titan Championship. {\an7}[Alex] Here's the thing. Kara tried pulling straight back, but the weight of the pole kept it from sliding easily. Now look at Charity. She lifted and pulled, perfect form. [Liam] Charity Witt shows her heart once again, and she's with Cari. There are folks at home who are following your story and completely inspired. What's your message to them as you head into the championship? It doesn't matter what you think of yourself. Don't give up. Just keep pushing through, and eventually, you'll start believing it for yourself, too. Congratulations, you're headed -to the Titan Championship. -Thank you so much. [Alex] So that means the women's bracket is all set for the Titan Championship next week. We have one spot left in the Titan Championship. Let's head down to Cari. So in our final battle tonight, it's the fit and fast farmer from Utah, Cole Wadsworth, {\an7}versus the Los Angeles lawyer with agility and drive, Derik Scott. Los Angeles lawyer Derik Scott scored two impressive upsets to reach the Battle of the Titans. [Alex] This hard-hand, MMA-fighting lawyer... [screams] [Cari] Showcasing impressive athleticism... [Liam] He's cracked through. [Cari] and a ferocious desire to win. [Alex] And he is a Titan! When I'm thinking about, "Why am I doing this? Why am I going through this physical pain?" My relationships with my brothers is what gives me so much strength and confidence. I have two brothers on Earth, and I have one brother in heaven. My brother, Ian, passed away in a car accident when I was about 12 years old. He was always our role model growing up. When he would say or do something, it carried so much weight, and it wasn't until we lost Ian that I recognized, like, "I have to be the best big brother to my brothers that I can be." I'm so close with my brothers. We train for fights together. [grunts] My brother who passed away inspires most, if not everything, that I do. So I'm absolutely ready to make my brother proud every single day, but especially here on The Titan Games. [Cari] Utah's Cole Wadsworth never stops moving. [horse neighs] Constant chores on his four-acre farm are often followed by what he calls adventure training. Rather than watching TV, I'm outside doing something, wake-boarding, snowboarding, rock climbing. Working outside is more functional, and it's also a lot more fun. Now I need this brush. I have two beautiful daughters. Giselle loves riding horses, working out with us. She loves climbing ropes, going to the obstacle gym. Oh, yeah. Good job. We try to really raise them to be strong, have a work ethic, and have willpower. Going into the Battle of the Titans, I want to show them that I can do it, and I want them to be proud of me, and I'm going to be the Titan Champion. [Dwayne] Cole, Derik, dig in, push back, and show the world how bad you want it. This is Lunar Impact. [dramatic music] [Liam] Cole in the silver, Derik in the gold. The ladder is crucial! {\an7}[Alex] It's a race 30 feet up! {\an7}And it seems like Derik Scott is going to get up there first, but just by a hair. [dramatic music] -Oh! -[Alex] Oh, my goodness! Derik just hit that wall with so much force. One has to wonder if he's okay! But he's pushing him back, Liam! {\an7}[Liam] And they both go low, grabbing that bar, and it's all leg power right now. {\an7}[Alex] We've seen what Lunar Impact can do to your legs. [grunts] Go, D! Remember, Melissa Alcantara couldn't even walk after this challenge a few weeks ago. Get low! Push! [grunting] [Alex] But Cole Wadsworth, look at the power coming out of him! [Liam] That's the farm guy from Utah, and he is plowing! Whoo! [Alex] But you can't count out the fighting MMA lawyer, Derik Scott. Dig in, Derik! Dig in, Derik! [grunts] [dramatic music] [grunting] Derik has to mount defense, and it seems like he's not able to as Cole forces him back. -This could be it! -Go! Push! [Liam] This looks like the end for Derik. [grunts] [Alex] Cole Wadsworth is right there! He is forcing him at the edge. He's got him, Liam! Come on, D! [Alex] And if you're Cole, you have to think, "What the hell do I have to do to put his guy away?" Push! Push! And I like what they're doing here. They're just using their body weight, but Derik... [Liam] He's running out of room! [Alex] Derik has no room to be able to mount a comeback! [mouths words] [grunts] Oh, my goodness! He's pushing him back, Liam! [grunts] I... What? [grunts] Go, go, go! Stop! This warrior will not rest! How is he doing this? [laughs] [grunts] [Liam] Derik Scott just keeps on pushing, looking to make all his brothers proud. [grunts] [Dwayne] This is what The Titan Games is all about, never, ever giving up. [grunts] -[Liam] Oh! -[Alex] Cole Wadsworth! -Cole's in trouble! -Oh, no! -He's on his knees! -Oh, no! -No, no, no, no! -Go! Go! Go! [Liam] And it looks like his feet are under the bar right now. [grunts] -Get up! -[Alex] This is not good. He has to establish any kind of defense. Derik Scott is forcing him off of the platform! [Liam] He's just being pushed. He can't get up. [Alex] He can't get back, and that is going to do it! Cole Wadsworth is out! Derik Scott is going to the Titan Championship! [dramatic music] -Yeah, babe! -[Alex] Oh, my word. I love you so much, brother. That's for you. Derik Scott is a beast! [cheers and applause] Yeah, D! [Alex] I am just floored! -You okay, brother? -Yeah. -You hurt? -No, I'm just... -in here, it hurts. -Yeah, you did great. -You did great, didn't quit. -Thank you for this. You did great. I'm proud of you. [Liam] It was a battle truly worthy of deciding the final spot in the Titan Championship. [Alex] I thought Derik was done for. He was just a few inches from taking a fall, but then tapped into a deeper power and pushed Cole all the way back to his knees and over the edge. Derik was already a Titan. Tonight, he became a legend. -I love you. -I love you. [Liam] So now all the matchups are locked. For the men, we have Bud man James Jean-Louis versus college man Bridger Buckley and Air Force Sergeant Tyler Lucas versus LA lawyer Derik Scott. From the thousands who applied, 64 exceptional athletes competed in the Titan Arena, and two of them will be crowned Titan Champions on our finale, the epic culmination of The Titan Games. I'll see you next week here at The Titan Games! [cheers and applause] [dramatic music]
