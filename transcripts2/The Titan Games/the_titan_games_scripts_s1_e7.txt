[wind blowing] [dramatic music] [Alex] Please welcome Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson! Okay. Welcome to Titan Arena. [cheers and applause] Let's get this show on the road. Welcome to The Titan Games. {\an7}Now we've got new competitors, and they're facing all {\an7}different challenges tonight. But first, please welcome the one, the only Cari Champion. -Do you like this outfit? -I love that, yes. Now, as always, one of my favorite things to say, Daddy's got to go to work. Well... -[laughs] -I'm gonna say the other favorite thing that I love to say, which is actually let The Titan Games begin! [cheers and applause] Okay, kicking things off, this is a battle between the passionate competitors. One's a small-town farm boy who goes hard in the gym and in life as well. The other is a football player who gave up his professional dreams to take care of his daughter. [cheers and applause] South Dakota's Davy Barnes, one of the strongest men in the competition, has made it his life's work to build and maintain the body of a Titan. At 17 years old, I was literally 147 pounds. My classmates would mistake me for a number two pencil. [grunting] I hit the gym five days a week, two hours a day. It took me about ten years to get to this weight. It took a lot of hard work. Learning the pec dance was not easy. I would have to stare in the mirror for hours and just practice. But I'm good now. so... [drumbeats] [laughs] [Cari] Muscles are Davy's brand, literally. I own my own business called Muscle Tile. When we show up to a job site... [doorbell rings] sometimes people think we're strippers. Hey, I'm Davy. This is Dan. We're Muscle Tile. My job is super physical. So I got to tear out walls, tear up tile. The bags are 100 pounds, so I definitely get a workout in. I'm competing in The Titan Games because people have literally called me "The Titan." So I feel like everything just screams "Davy." ♪ You got to be Some type of animal ♪ [soft music] I met my high school sweetheart, Isa, at 17, I proposed to her at 19, and we got married at 20. We are proud to present... [Isa] Our baby girl. [Cari] A star college athlete, Elisara was chasing his dream of a career in the NFL. But just months before the NFL draft, his wife, Isa, was diagnosed with late-stage lupus. Elisara stopped training to be by her side. Thank you, baby. [Elisara] She wasn't getting any better. Her body was breaking down. She couldn't walk. It was... It was real hard. [Cari] Her condition never improved, and at just 23, she passed away. I lost my best friend, and I lost the Mom to my kid. Whew. [phone rings] Elisara, Dwayne Johnson. How are you, brother? Oh, shoot! I wanted to tell you, man, I know that you lost your wife, and I just want to say, from my heart to yours, I know she's gonna be very, very proud of you, you know, when she... when she sees you perform. You made it to The Titan Games. You did it. Oh, man, I appreciate it so much, man. This means a lot to me, man. Oh. Dwayne Johnson is someone I've always looked up to. I want to be a Titan more than I want to be an NFL player. That's how much this is to me. That's real. I can't wait. Let's go! [laughs] -Let's get it. -Oh, The Rock, bro! [cheers and applause] [Liam] And now his big moment is here. Family means everything to Elisara, and they're here to support him tonight. Elisara, at 6'1", 240, is a big guy, but he's going up against an even bigger guy. Davy Barnes is massive, 6'3", 260. These dudes are about to level the Titan Arena on a challenge we call Atlas Smash. [Liam] And DJ's ready to drop the hammer. This game may look like a twisted playground, but the reality is it's a proving ground. -So, Davy... -Whoo! Elisara, time to prove you deserve to be a Titan. This is Atlas Smash. [dramatic music] [Liam] Goldenboy, both of those Atlas stones, 350 pounds. You have to smash off pieces {\an7}until the stone is light enough to lift to the top. {\an7}[Alex] Look at those massive swings from Elisara. You can see those Maori tattoos on his shoulder. {\an7}He comes from a long line of {\an7}Samoan warriors, just like DJ. [both grunting] Davy with those short hits. He's a tile guy, so he knows his way around a hammer. {\an7}[Liam] I look at Davy Barnes, I wonder if he even needs the hammer. The guy is enormous. I feel like he could just take his fists and smash it to pieces. [Alex] But look at Elisara. He has just shredded that Atlas stone. He goes all the way up, and he's lifting it up! [grunts] But you can see the struggle in his arms. The more concrete you chip off, the lighter the stone is. [Liam] On the other side of things, Davy Barnes racing to get that first stone down to size. And now he's going for his rope. He needs to pull that stone up 25 feet in the air. [Alex] Elisara just right there. [cheers and applause] And it's up! Elisara already raises his first stone 25 feet. [cheers and applause] Way to go! [Dwayne] Elisara is relentless right now. [Alex] Davy has his first stone halfway up. That stone must still weigh as much as Davy does. That's brute strength, Liam. [grunts] And he locks it in! Davy's got to get moving here. [Liam] For Elisara Edwards, what a journey. Such an inspiration. Slugging it out in the Titan Arena. [grunting] [Alex] Look at the exhaustion starting to kick in. At the beginning, he was swinging that hammer with ferocity. But he's still getting a lot of leverage out of those long swings. Davy, sticking to the shorter ones, barely making a dent. [Dwayne] These are some big boys. They got a lot of muscle on them, but they got to dig deep here, 'cause right now, that fatigue is setting in. [both grunting] [Liam] Elisara going for that second stone. He says his daughter Ellyse, that's his inspiration. When he's tired, when he's gassed, he will think of her. [grunts] [Alex] Time is running out for Davy Barnes. [Dwayne] I designed this challenge to make you quit. You can see it in their bodies. But Elisara, he's not quitting. Neither one of these guys are quitting. [Alex] Does Elisara have the iron will to bring this up and win this game? Go, Eli! Go! Go, Eli! Go! Go, Eli! Go! [Alex] This is it! Right here, right now. Dig deep, Elisara! You are so close. [Liam] And that is it. Elisara Edwards does it. A man who suffered a tragic loss finds victory tonight in the Titan Arena. [yells] That warrior spirit's coming out of Elisara right now. -[cheers and applause] -I understand. [laughs] [exhales] -I know. You did it! -That's my brother! [dramatic music] When I was 15, I moved to a new state. I was so big, the kids at my new school thought I was an undercover cop, true story. Take a look at the picture. There it is right there. Yes, that's me. I look like a completely normal 15-year-old with a mustache who also looks 49. My point is, it's easy to make a snap judgment. I chose these next two competitors because they defy expectations. Now let's meet them. [cheers and applause] [Cari] Dwayne Johnson has motivated millions around the world, as far as southwestern Nigeria, where college student Covenant Falana spent his childhood. [Covenant] Growing up in Nigeria was hard. Majority of the time, well, there's no electricity. There was hardly any food to eat. But I've always had dreams of moving to America. Oh, look out! My brother and I would watch wrestling, Undertaker, The Rock, all of them, all day. I wanted to have big muscles like him. That was my goal. When Covenant came {\an7}to the States for high school, his goal of getting bigger got bigger. The football guys and the basketball guys were, like, the people I wanted to roll with. But, then, I wasn't built like that at that time. I was skinny, and I was African, and I needed a model, and The Rock was my model. And the girls liked that, which is cool. [laughs] ♪ Next level ♪ ♪ Top floor, next level ♪ [Cari] Covenant joined a gym, and if he saw someone with big muscles, he copied their routine, adding 20 pounds of his own muscle to his six-foot frame. ♪ Top floor, next level ♪ I have worked hard to build the body of a Titan. But it's not about how much you can lift. It's really about how much heart you have, and it's a big chest and an elastic heart. ♪ Man, we next-level status So kill all the drama ♪ {\an7}♪ Take it to the next level ♪ [cheers and applause] ♪ I feel a burn That nobody can tame ♪ Being here at The Titan Games, {\an7}the one main thing that I want to show is perseverance. It was bred into me that I just don't quit. Me and your Dad are just so proud of you. Neither of my parents went to college. My Dad worked overtime, my Mom cleaned houses on the side, and I always knew that I needed to go to college and be the first person to graduate. -Hey, Jamie, how you doing? -Hey, Dr. Schaeffer. -Nice to see you. -Brad not only graduated. He became an accomplished foot and ankle surgeon, but not before failing his board exams three times. There were moments where I definitely did not think that I could get through it. When I finally got that last passing grade in the board exam, it was the first time I knew that perseverance and hard work can conquer all. Just never give up. Just keep pushing. Yeah. I'm just literally an everyday doctor, and I'm here to compete, and I'm here to try my best. I've gotten everywhere I am today because I do not quit, and I won't quit now. ♪ This is my battle cry ♪ [cheers and applause] [Liam] Well, between the leg surgeries and the spreadsheets, both of these guys are good at delicate operations, so we found them a challenge {\an7}that requires muscle and mind. [Alex] Let's see how much they can take on the Tower Drop. DJ engineered this challenge to test balance and arm strength. The objective is to scale a tower that's taller than a streetlight. Along the way, you must generate enough leverage against a vertical wall to remove seven 15-foot-long poles. [Liam] At the top, the final golden pole is trapped under a 50-pound weighted ball. If you're first to yank it free, we'll see you at Mount Olympus. [cheers and applause] Brad, Covenant, you've been preparing for this moment for a very, very long time. Time to make your own success. This is Tower Drop. [dramatic music] [Liam] Brad Schaeffer in the red. Covenant Falana in the blue. Right away, they rip out the first pole. [Alex] And Covenant just reaches up for that second pole. Brad's straddling the post to balance. And it's a dead heat! {\an7}Brad's Mom is looking nervous. {\an7}[Liam] These poles are on {\an7}different sides of the tower. You need a plan. And right there, Covenant realizes he missed that third pole. -[Alex] Nice stretch! -Oh! He just needs to make sure that he's keeping an eye out for those other poles. [Liam] Brad taking care of business. The foot doctor, no problem with his balance. {\an7}[Alex] On the other tower, {\an7}Covenant gets his fourth pole. Oh, and he stumbled! It's not easy to perch up there. Those posts, they're only two feet long. [Liam] And Covenant just {\an7}realized he missed another one. {\an7}The business student has to {\an7}backtrack for that fifth pole. {\an7}Mental mistakes will cost you. Meanwhile, Brad gets number six. {\an7}Brad's right at the end here. One last red pole out, {\an7}and he's on to the gold pole. [cheers and applause] [Alex] This is so close! Covenant's up top! Here goes six. And... What? He pulled the golden pole too soon. {\an7}[Liam] Yeah, he missed the last {\an7}blue pole on the other side. That ball won't budge. It cannot fall until all the poles are out. [Alex] Brad's right there. The gold is gone! The ball drops! He pulls the victory chain, and Brad Schaeffer is your winner. You can look now, Mrs. Schaeffer. [Liam] Surgical strategy, Dr. Brad wins it. He is moving on to Mount Olympus. {\an7}[Alex] Covenant tried taking a straight line to the top, but he missed poles along the way and even jumped the gun on the golden pole. And Brad's run was flawless, using speed and balance to practically bounce his way up the tower. Now the doctor is {\an7}in our Mount Olympus showdown. [Liam] This win means Brad {\an7}will be facing Elisara Edwards for a shot to become a Titan... Oh, my gosh! and continue on in this competition. [dramatic music] [Liam] Welcome back to Titan Arena. It's time for our next showdown. Let's head back down to Cari. In this battle, two strong athletes with a lot to prove. One's a 51-year-old weight lifter and a mom of four who's defying the odds in more ways than one. The other honors her brother every single day by pushing herself in ways she never thought possible. [cheers and applause] True Titans need immense courage. Shannon Decker's emerged early, when her parents were unable to provide for her and her brother. My brother and I had our own little family unit, because we were always looking out for each other. When I was 15, my brother and I ended up getting emancipated. That's when the courts tell you that you can be on your own. Eventually I made my way to live with my aunt and uncle. Even though I had a traumatic upbringing, sports was always there. [uplifting music] I played basketball. I swam, wake-boarded, I surfed, I skateboarded, and I started to realize what life could be. [Cari] Sports became Shannon's salvation, which led to a thriving career as a fitness model. And when a rock-climbing accident claimed her brother's life, it's where she turned again. I felt like we had fought through everything our whole lives and... and, like, we lost. [somber music] I didn't know how to deal with my grief, so all I did was work out, because I felt like that was the one thing in my life I had control over. ♪ But I'm still a fighter ♪ I am living proof that sports and fitness can pull you out of your darkest moments. ♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪ [dramatic music] [Cari] Not only is Sandra Arechaederra the oldest competitor in The Titan Games, but this 51-year-old mother of four wasn't even an athlete until a few years ago. I didn't start in sports until I was 42. My husband bought gym memberships, and I decided to just start going, because he wasn't using them. And I walked in, and I said, "I'd like someone to train me." And it was three big guys, and they looked at me and said, "We don't train women." So I decided to teach myself how to weight lift. ♪ Wake up and do The right thing ♪ ♪ Get on the right track ♪ ♪ When the good start bad ♪ [Cari] Within four years, Sandra was a competitive weight lifter, breaking six Masters national records in three different age groups. I'm nailing this as a mother, and I'm nailing this as an athlete. I will be a Titan. ♪ When the good start bad ♪ [cheers and applause] Whoo! {\an7}Show them what you're made of! [Liam] Sandra has {\an7}two of her kids here tonight, and Shannon Decker has her aunt and cousins in her corner. [Alex] Shannon and Sandra will have to hit the ground running, because their challenge is Uprising. [Liam] They have to pull a 25-pound anvil up through five solid levels to reach the victory chain. Time for liftoff. DJ? Shannon and Sandra, I know you both thrive under pressure, which is why I personally chose you for this next challenge. Get ready for Uprising. [Liam] Sandra in the red. Shannon in the blue. How do you attack that first barrier? Well, Shannon's through it. [Alex] Ah, Shannon already tears through it. Sandra also broke through, but her anvil's catching {\an7}the edge of that lower floor. [both grunting] {\an7}The weight and resistance {\an7}will pull you off the ground. Now Shannon charges and slams through that second floor! Come on, ladies. [Liam] This is wind sprints with a 25-pound anchor on your back. [grunts] [grunts] [Alex] And Sandra does break through that second solid floor! Whoo! Look, the third level... twice as thick, twice as tough. [Liam] Both women struggling a little here. They're slowing down and not getting enough punch on that double layer. Go, Shannon! Go! [Liam] Oh! Shannon bulldozed through. [Alex] Look at that! Shannon dove forward for some extra pop. But she is not cleanly through it yet, Liam. [grunts] And there it is! [Liam] On the other side, Sandra is making contact, but the edge of her anvil is hitting the sides of that second floor, and that's slowing her down. -Keep pushing! -Come on, Mama! [Alex] Another big dive! Shannon's up to the fourth barrier. -You got it! -Her diving technique is making a difference. Time is running out for Sandra. Come on. Come on. [Liam] Is this one last charge for victory? [Alex] Charging in, and, oh, my God! -She doesn't get it. -Yes, one more, Shannon! [Alex] She's going for it again. [grunts] There it is! Shannon Decker is your winner! [cheers and applause] These ladies are tough, tough ladies. We're proud of you, Mom! [Liam] Shannon Decker headed to Mount Olympus, one step closer to becoming a Titan. -Thank you for that. -Thank you. {\an7}-And that's hard, by the way. -It was really heavy. Yes, I know. -She did so good. -She did. [dramatic music] I created The Titan Games only after I was told I wasn't gonna be allowed on The Voice. Now, rumor has it Blake Shelton didn't want me on it. Well, you know, I don't know if Blake Shelton could do any of these challenges, but I do know this. ♪ Well, if your name's Blake Shelton ♪ ♪ You're strong And full of class ♪ ♪ But if you went On The Titan Games ♪ ♪ This show Would whup your ass ♪ [laughs] Thank you very much. It's time for our next battle. [Alex] Hey, Blake is a Titan of country music, though. [Liam] And right now, we've got two more athletes ready to rock here in Titan Arena. On the starting line, we have Kara Lazauskas. This Master's student is a medical marvel. At three years old, she was diagnosed with a tumor and had one of her lungs removed. Kara refused to let that or anything slow her down. She became an amateur MMA fighter and so fascinated by human performance that she works as a muscle research coordinator at Cal State Fullerton. And facing Kara is Breona Evans. From 9:00 to 5:00, she's an accountant for a construction firm in Atlanta. But before and after work, she's in the gym testing her limits. Breona has her boyfriend, {\an7}Brandon, here to cheer her on. Let's go, baby! Goldenboy, these are two women that won't let anything block their way, but on this next challenge, there's no way to avoid it. It's time to pull out all the stops and go Off the Rails. On this long, painful trip down the wrong side of the tracks, you must first pull yourself and a 200-pound sled along a 60-foot rail, collecting 50-pound beams along the way. [Liam] By the end, you'll be pulling 600 pounds. To get back, you'll need precision and coordination to hook the anchor and reel yourself to the victory chain. All right, creating these games gave me a chance to take some of the valuable lessons I've learned and bring them to life through these challenges, lessons like "there's no substitute for hard work," and "if something stands between you and your success, move it. Never be denied." So, Kara, Breona, time to go to school. This is Off the Rails. [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] [Liam] Kara in the blue. Breona in the red. They're off, and they are pulling. [Alex] They both get low in line with the rope, but look at Kara. She's got her left leg against the post to get more leverage, and it's working. Kara's cruising! [both grunting] [Liam] Breona is really struggling. Once you lose momentum, it's hard to get started again, and that is exactly what's happening with her. Come on, baby! Let's go! [Alex] I can't believe that Breona is having such a hard time bringing this forward. She has the upper body strength, but Kara is halfway home. [grunts] This second part takes a totally different set of skills, because now you have to throw that hook like an anchor and pull yourself forward. {\an7}Let's go, baby! Good job, Kara! [breathing heavily] [Liam] Now Breona the accountant is trying to get back in business. And her sled is back on the move. She's not giving up. [Alex] But on the other side, Kara Lazauskas. She's using short throws and quick pulls. [Liam] And it looks like Breona found her groove. She's picking up the pace, but Kara is already halfway back. She's an incredible story. She says only having one lung has made her work harder than she ever would have before. She is determined to show the world what she's made of here. [Alex] And look at Breona! The strain on those arms! She's not giving up, but Kara is killing it right now. She is right there. It's the end of the line. Kara pushes down the gate. The chain is right in front of her. It's a slam-dunk for Kara! Let's go, baby! Let's go, baby! [Liam] A dominant effort by Kara Lazauskas. She squares off with fitness model Shannon Decker for the title of Titan {\an7}and the chance to continue on in this competition. Breona saluting the crowd. They're giving her love right back. [Alex] She is still a winner for being here today. -I love you. -I love you, too. [Alex] Oh, wait a minute! [cheers and applause] [laughs] You're my best friend. I love you more than anything. And you once told me that I was your person. You're my person, and I want you to be that person for the rest of my life. I love you. Will you marry me? [cheers and applause] Yes! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [cheers and applause] I think that was a yes. It was a yes. -Congratulations! -Oh, my God! Congrats. -Who's the real winner? -Oh, my God. [Alex] So Breona is heading down the aisle, and Kara has a date with Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] Mount Olympus. It's designed to push our competitors to their absolute limit. It's truly the ultimate battleground, and conquering it is the only way to prove you're worthy of being a Titan. Now two fierce competitors who had spectacular performances earlier tonight return to compete on Mount Olympus. [cheers and applause] My edge going into Mount Olympus is that I've been conquering obstacles my entire life. When I was three, I had a tumor that covered 75% of my left lung. They had to take the entire lung out. When you think you're done, I want two or three more minutes. My lung capacity right now is about 78%, which is, like, like typical smoker. When your own doctor tells you that you're never really gonna be a real athlete, you're never gonna be able to run, you're never gonna have this capacity, I realized right from the get-go that I had to work harder than everyone else. [Alex] She has shown us some incredible willpower, Liam. Kara has made it! It's important for me to win and become a Titan tonight to prove to myself and to every doctor that told me I couldn't be an athlete that nothing is gonna stop me. Tonight's extra special because it's actually the anniversary of my brother's death, so I just feel him with me, and it makes me want to push that much harder. [Alex] But here goes Shannon Decker's next approach. [Liam] Is this one last charge for victory? There it is! Kara, tonight is gonna be an epic battle. I know you're a fighter, but what you don't know about me is I've been fighting my whole life, so I'm ready for you. All right, Kara, Shannon, right now, I want you to remember how far you've come and what it is you're fighting for. You've shown what happens when hard work meets unshakable resolve. Time to get to work. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Check out Kara in the red. Right off the bat, she said this 1,000-pound wall will be an advantage for her strength-wise. [grunts] [grunting] [Alex] Well, and Kara was right. [Liam] Shannon has her wall down as well. Let's go, ladies. [Alex] Now it's over to the Gates of Olympus. [Liam] These gates are 150 pounds each. It takes full body strength, the core, the legs. Kara right now, no problem whatsoever. [Alex] She now makes her way over to the Rolling Ascent. Spider monkey! She's a spider monkey! [exhales] [Alex] Shannon is still stuck at the Gates of Olympus. They are not opening up for her. And, oh, my goodness, Kara is crushing it right now! [Liam] She is tearing up Mount Olympus. On the other side, Shannon Decker still struggling to push up those gates. Let's go, Shannon! There you go! [grunts] And she finally gets it up there. Now she has to gain on Kara. Can Shannon make it up? [Liam] The Cliffs should be fun for an MMA fighter like Kara. It's 12 feet high. You have to punch, kick, create the ladder, and rise. Now here comes Shannon, moving smoothly up the Rolling Ascent. She's right back in the race. Come on! Come on, Shannon! Meanwhile, Kara, she is up top Mount Olympus. [Alex] She knew that she had the edge on strength going into this, but the question will be cardio. She only has 78% lung capacity, and she flew up the mountain. Does she have enough steam to keep up that pace against Shannon? Let's go, Shannon. Get up that wall. [yells] [Liam] Right now, it's time to turn and burn. [Alex] That torch weighs 600 pounds. [grunts] [Liam] Kara fires up her torch. Let's go, Kara! Now it's time for a 60-foot drop. Get down here to me, Kara! Come on! [Alex] Kara charged up the mountain. Now coming back down, the walls are in her way. She has to jump over a five-foot, six-foot, and seven-foot wall in order to get down Mount Olympus. [Liam] And Shannon's not giving up. She told us she's a fighter. Yes! Yes! [grunts] But Kara is already at that final wall. -Let's go! -Let's go, Kara! [Alex] The old Ball and Chain. This is 200 pounds that you have to drag across the floor of the Titan Arena. [grunts] [Liam] Kara's struggling. [Alex] Did she go too fast too soon? Come on, Kara. Dig deep. We've seen people take a lot of time moving the ball and chain. It's never over until you lock in that key. [grunts] Bring it home, Kara! Bring it home! Bring it home! [Alex] Shannon has to hurry up! [Liam] Kara's at the Titan tomb. Shannon is still fighting. [grunts] Kara hammering away! [both grunting] [Alex] And Shannon does it! She's heading down! Now Kara is looking to finish this. [grunts] Shannon's down to the first wall, but it's too late. Kara, she has the relic. All she has to do is turn the key... and success is hers! -She is a Titan! -Let's go! Hey! [cheers and applause] Oh, my God. [laughter] Yeah, Kara. [Liam] Shannon Decker put up a fight that would have make her brother proud. -Good job. -Thank you. -Great job. Great job. -Thank you so much. -Is your hand okay? -Oh, I'm good. -You all right? -I'm gonna go home and work on my forearm strength. {\an7}[Liam] But tonight it's Kara who takes the Titan crown. [cheers and applause] Come on. Come on, Kara. You've earned this one. -Whoo. -Congratulations. -You're a Titan. -Oh, thank you, sir. -Come here. -I appreciate it. -Great job. -Thank you, sir. This badass has one lung, unlimited heart. We'll be right back on Titan Games. -Congratulations. -Thank you. [dramatic music] I devised this competition to be a physical and mental journey, one that's just getting started, so those crowned tonight will return to the Titan Arena for what I like to call the ultimate Battle of the Titans. Now two powerful athletes return to face off... Brad Schaeffer, the dedicated surgeon, and Elisara Edwards, the devoted family man. [dramatic music] An edge I have over Brad, I feel, is my strength and my height. He's a little shorter, and it's kind of like a David versus Goliath. I know he's stronger than me... [Alex] He just shredded that Atlas stone! but I've never gone down without a fight. [Alex] Brad Schaeffer is your winner! I'm definitely gonna become a Titan for my daughter. I just want to prove to her that dreams will come true no matter what the circumstances are, and I just have to show the world that I'm ready for it. [cheers and applause] [Liam] You heard Elisara say it's a David versus Goliath matchup. He is three inches taller. He is 70 pounds heavier. What a matchup we have, DJ. -Whoo! -Get 'em, Brad! {\an7}[Dwayne] What a matchup, boys. All right, we've seen plenty of competitors' strengths tonight, but this monster has been really good at finding their weaknesses. So, Brad and Elisara, you better not be intimidated. This is your moment. Own it. This is Mount Olympus. [Liam] Elisara in the blue. Brad in the red. [Alex] And I want to see how Elisara's gonna tackle the 1,000-pound wall, and he immediately just knocks it down. My uso, Elisara. [grunts] [Alex] Brad a little bit behind him there. Smaller competitors have struggled here. You're gonna see that upper-body strength from Elisara come into play. [grunting] [Liam] A full display, The bigger man making light work of those first two obstacles, but this is where it gets tricky sometimes for the bigger guys. Let's go, Elisara. Let's go, Brad. Let's go! [Alex] This is where Brad can make up ground, because the Rolling Ascent can be like kryptonite for big guys. But not Elisara! He flies through the Rolling Ascent. And Brad Schaeffer is right on his heels. [grunts] Now it's time to punch in at The Cliffs. [Liam] Big part of this is strategy. You need to create your own ladder. You need to punch, kick the way through. You can't make those holes too big, or else you're gonna fall right through that wall. [grunts] [Alex] And Elisara used his size to his advantage, that 6'1" frame. He pulled himself up. The surgeon making cuts in that wall with his bare hands. Let's go, Brad! Get up that wall! [Alex] And Elisara is now raising that torch. [Liam] On top of Mount Olympus. Heard him say before that he knows his wife will be with him on Mount Olympus. [grunts] And Brad's catching up, heading to the crank. [Alex] It's a big moment here for Elisara, who has given up so much to be here. But Brad Schaeffer, this guy took his medical boards three times. He's a doctor of determination. Elisara, though, manages to raise the torch. Whoo! And now it's time to descend Mount Olympus. [Liam] Slamming into those walls, not easy when you're 240 pounds. [grunts] Oh, but Elisara just somersaults over it. [grunts] And here comes Brad Schaeffer almost 15 seconds behind. Time to tap into that speed. Come on, Brad! He'll make it up here. Let's go, Brad! Get down here to me! [Alex] Look at the speed from Brad Schaeffer. He's just one wall behind Elisara. This is a very close race, Liam. [grunts] Elisara down first, but does this devoted dad have anything left to drag this 250-pound boulder to the Titan tomb? [grunting] [Liam] And Brad Schaeffer makes it down. Yeah! Come on, Brad! Now, he still has a chance, because Elisara is struggling here. Come on, uso. Come on. [Liam] Brad Schaeffer told us the Ball and Chain was the one thing he was worried about. But it's not a problem. [Alex] Look at him move! He grabs it from the base of the boulder. David is gaining on Goliath. [grunting] And Elisara is at the tomb, but will the hammer reach? [Liam] He's not close enough. He's gotta get a few more feet on the other side. Brad Schaeffer only 168 pounds. He needs some power here. [Alex] That could be Elisara's undoing... Oh, no! It doesn't matter for Elisara. He's just lugging away with that hammer. He's inside the tomb! Elisara could be our next Titan. He's not waiting. He's digging for that relic. [Liam] Brad Schaeffer's broken through as well. They're both digging right now, trying to find that relic. [Alex] Brad trying to clear all the pieces. Elisara is digging deep. Does Brad Schaeffer have it in his grasp, though? -Brad Schaeffer! -Unbelievable! [Alex] Brad Schaeffer has the key! So does Elisara, but Brad, he's gonna lock it in! I can't believe it! What a race between two absolutely dominant competitors. [Liam] What a comeback. -All right! -[laughs] Yes! [Alex] Heard Brad Schaeffer say there would be no quit in him tonight. It came right down to the end. He was way behind, but what a finish. [triumphant music] His mother Teri, Dad Randy. Brad says they gave him his work ethic, and that paid off tonight. [cheers and applause] -You came this far. -I love you, bro. I'm proud of you, son. I'm proud of you. -I couldn't find it. -It's all right, bro. Keep your head up. It's part of life. [Liam] A tough loss for Elisara. You can see the blood and the sweat, and he's certainly earned our respect. Good games, bro. [cheers and applause] [Alex] Racing up and sliding down, Brad was behind the entire time. But at the Tomb, Elisara couldn't find the relic, and David slew Goliath once again, this time by less than a second, the closest race we've seen all season. All right, my man, here you go. -You've earned this one. -Thanks, Dwayne. -Congratulations, brother. -Thanks a lot. -Great job. -Thank you so much. -Great job. -Appreciate it. Absolutely. [Liam] So Brad and Kara earn the final two spots on Dwayne's Team of Titans. [Alex] And next week, all 16 of our winners return for the Battle of the Titans. It's the best of the best, and we're one step away from the Titan Championship. [dramatic music]
