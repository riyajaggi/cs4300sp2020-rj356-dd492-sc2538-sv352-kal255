 and their perseverance. I'm a father of four, I'm a firefighter, and I'm a cancer survivor. [Alex] This is the time that you have to dig deep. [Steven] I feel like I'm invincible. -♪ We are heroes ♪ -Yes! ♪ Heroes In the darkest times ♪ [Dwayne] I've prepared four more mind-blowing challenges, including one that's 30 feet above the ground. [Alex] You see the anguish, the struggle. [Dwayne] Those that prevail advance to Mount Olympus to face seven grueling trials engineered to test every fiber of their being. That was incredible. ♪ We are, we are heroes ♪ -Don't quit! -[yells] [Dwayne] In the end, one man and one woman will become Titan Champions. It's time to find some heroes. It's time for The Titan Games. ♪ We are heroes ♪ [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] [Alex] Please welcome Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson! Welcome to Titan Arena. Our first four Titans have been crowned, and we're off and running. Tonight, eight more powerful competitors have arrived from all over the country to put their abilities to the test. Among the people I've chosen are a student, a dental hygienist, a mechanical engineer, and a stay-at-home dad. They're all going to enter the Titan Arena and face off on our one-of-a-kind grueling challenges. To get us started, a big round of applause for mi amiga, Cari Champion. -Thank you, DJ! -You're welcome. [cheers and applause] And now, my very favorite thing to say. If you smell... not... not that one. Not that one. The other favorite thing I love to say. Let The Titan Games begin. [dramatic music] [Cari] We're kicking things off with a match between two mothers. One's a dental hygienist who wants to show her daughters that they can achieve anything. The other is a loving mom who got through a very difficult time by deciding to get healthy. [dramatic music] I want my daughter, Isabella, to know that she's strong like me. She can do anything that she puts her mind to. [Cari] Seven years ago, Melissa Alcantara was a newly-married hostess in the Bronx, a drinker and a smoker until she got pregnant at 26. After I gave birth, I was 200 pounds, and I fell into postpartum depression. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror. I just remember being, like, "This is not me. I can't do this anymore." ♪ Turn up the lights ♪ ♪ Let's touch the sky ♪ ♪ We set the bar Higher and higher ♪ Melissa became a fitness fanatic, and began posting her weight loss journey on social media... and to her surprise, inspired hundreds of thousands of women around the world, leading to her new career as a personal trainer. I know so many moms that were in my position, and a lot of them reach out to me. And it is the reason why I do what I do, because they motivate me. ♪ Leave it all out On the floor ♪ ♪ Turning up every dial ♪ One mom she inspired happened to be the queen of social media. Crazy enough, Kim Kardashian contacted me to train her. I was like, what? No! Go, go, go, go! You guys, she's trying to kill me... -Only a little bit. -...officially. Melissa accomplished another goal by reaching The Titan Games, but she's not done yet. ♪ Take it higher and higher ♪ If I can do this, then I can do anything. ♪ Take it higher and higher ♪ [soft music] [Cari] After a rough childhood in rural West Virginia, Christina Luna joined the Air National Guard. But when she had her first child, Christina went back to school to become a dental hygienist. Life was a huge struggle. I got a divorce from the girls's father. I was bringing the girls to school with me. I was budgeting out... "This week, we're eating ramen, girls. This week, peanut butter and jelly." I said, "When Mommy gets through with school, I promise you I'm gonna buy us a house." Go ahead, and have a seat. I recently bought our home for me and my daughters. [uplifting music] I grew up in a trailer. I never had a home of my own. To be able to provide the life that I'm giving them means so much. What do you think Mommy needs to do to win The Titan Games? -Don't give up. -Be brave. Be brave? I can do those things. When I told them I was going to be competing at The Titan Games, they were so excited. They're, like, "You're going to meet the guy from Jumanji?" [laughs] [dramatic music] As a single mother working a full-time job, Christina doesn't have as much time as she'd like to hit the gym, but she makes the most of the time she has. I have what it takes to be a Titan, because I am a fighter. I've been dealing with adversity my entire life. I've worked so hard to be here, and there's no way I'm going down without a fight. [cheers and applause] Hello, everyone. I'm Liam McHugh, alongside my partner, Alex "Goldenboy" Mendez. And these ladies are about to push their limits for this challenge tonight. [Alex] This is like a sumo match in outer space. {\an7}We call this one Lunar Impact. [dramatic music] Afraid of heights? Well, too bad! {\an7}Lunar Impact's action happens 30 feet in the air. [Liam] First, we're testing speed and agility as you race up a ladder that's three stories tall. Then, you use your lower body power to drive the sliding wall, and push your opponent off the narrow, crescent-shaped bridge. [Alex] Last one standing is headed to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] All right, in my life, I've found it's not how many obstacles get in your way. It's about how well you push past them. Now, these two very powerful athletes have experienced pushing past anything life throws at them. And that's a good thing, because they're in for a challenge of a lifetime. So, Christina and Melissa, it's time for takeoff. This is Lunar Impact. [dramatic music] [Liam] Melissa in the blue, Christina in the red. Whoever can get up that ladder first has a very clear and real advantage. And right now, Melissa looks very good. [Alex] It's critical, Liam. Whoever starts pushing that wall first has a huge edge. You could be the one to dictate the pace of this matchup. [cheers and applause] And Melissa manages to get up there first. But here comes Christina. And they slam at the same time! And Christina is holding her ground. [Liam] You will see the leg power here, the core strength, and then the sheer mental will. [grunts] You can hear how hard this is for them. [Alex] And Melissa, she's pushing Christina a little off-balance here. [grunts] This is what you want to see in The Titan Games! Two driven opponents. Everyday heroes, here in the Titan Arena. [grunts] And right now, Melissa has the lead. Let's go, Mel! Let's go, Mel! It won't take long to burn out. They're using every ounce of strength to keep their opponent from pushing them off the bridge. What do you think, DJ? That fatigue is setting in. The lactic acid is setting in. Someone is going to break. [both grunting] [Liam] And Melissa making another big push. And she forces her back inch by inch. [dramatic music] Christine is in the danger zone right now. Look at Christina. She's going low, grabbing that bar for leverage. [both grunting] [Alex] And it's working, Liam! Look at this! She's pushing Melissa back! [both grunt] No, no, no, no, no, no! [grunts] Christina had her back against the wall, and she managed to push it back to the center. [cheers and applause] She wants to end this, Liam! She's pushing so hard, Melissa's feet are sliding. [grunts] Christina now has forced back Melissa even more. [Liam] Christina was 15 feet away from being shoved off the other side. She has come all the way back. And now Melissa's less than 10 feet from the edge. Amazing. [grunts] [Alex] That, Liam, is the sound of suffering. [Dwayne] Come on. Don't quit! [Alex] Christina Luna is right there. Melissa's right foot went off the bridge! Christina is so close! [dramatic music] [Liam] Luna, looking to shut this down. Melissa is staring at a 30-foot fall and the end of her Titan dreams. [grunts] [Alex] Uh-oh, wait a minute. I thought she was done! [cheers and applause] Are you kidding me? [Liam] This is unbelievable. -Unbelievable! -She's pushing it back, Liam! Push! Push! Push! [grunts] [Alex] She's pushing it back, because that's what you do when you come from the Bronx! You throw it all out there every single day. [Liam] And Christina, Christina looks gassed. [cheers and applause] All the way! Go! [Alex] The end is nigh! The end is nigh for Christina Luna! That's it! That's it! Oh, my God! [dramatic music] Oh, my God. -What?! What?! -Yeah! Yeah! Wow. [Alex] I-I can't. This is unreal. That was a war. [Liam] Melissa was just a few feet from watching her Titan dreams take a fall. But somehow, she summoned all her athletic power, and battled Christina all the way back and over the edge. [Alex] Melissa Alcantara is heading to Mount Olympus. Wow, that was the most brutal thing... oh, my God... I ever did in my life. -Catch your breath. -Oh, my God. Worse than giving birth, wow. [laughs] -Man, girl, that was a fight. -Oh, my God. Thank you. Stay strong. [cheers and applause] [whistles] If I ever have a team, you're on it. -Holy moly. -We did so good. [dramatic music] All our daughters will be proud of that. -That's right. -All right. Congratulations, you guys. Let's limp ourselves out of here. [Alex] Melissa needs to rest up. She's headed to Mount Olympus for the chance to become a Titan, and maybe by season's end, our Titan Champion. Two more athletes are about to enter Titan Arena to face off, and the winner of this challenge heads to Mount Olympus, the quintessential test of athleticism and determination. I mean, look at it! It is slightly terrifying, yet ridiculously beautiful. Just like me after six shots of tequila. [laughter] Conquer Mount Olympus, and become a Titan. Time for our next battle. {\an7}This battle features a student who bounced back from a life-changing accident and is now more powerful than ever, versus a super-athletic stay-at-home dad. [dramatic music] I knew from four years old I wanted to be a pro wrestler. They were these larger-than-life characters that were real people fighting in a ring, and I just... I loved it. [announcer] Robbie... I've been a pro wrestler for 18 years. I'm used to pain. Wrestlers are beat up. I think my body could get through anything. My wife works corporate for a national gym chain, so she's traveling a lot. [cries] All right, all right. Cashie, you want a blueberry? So my life is daddy day care for baby twins named Cash and Carter. Guys, muscles. [bright music] No, that's muscle face. That's not muscle arm. [babbles] I carry them around a lot. You know, whether I have both on my shoulders. {\an7}Can do some squats with them, so I'll use them as weights sometimes just to get a workout in, and they love it. Look at my bicep {\an7}getting bigger from my baby. [laughs] Hey. [dramatic music] I'm coming here to compete in The Titan Games because I'm a huge fan of Dwayne 'cause I'm in pro wrestling. He's the only guy that I actually will admit I have a man crush on. I think a Titan, to me, means just someone who is super strong mentally, physically, badass. I mean, come on, dude. I'm ready for this. ♪ Yeah, the crowds will cheer ♪ ♪ Then they disappear ♪ ♪ And you never stop Playing the game ♪ [Cari] Bridger Buckley, a 220-pound former college football player trains five hours every day. His hardcore training started three years ago after being hit by a car while riding his bike. ♪ Black and blue Got the scars to prove ♪ ♪ But there ain't no shame In the pain ♪ Bridger battled to get back in shape, but he admits he was also motivated by some painful childhood memories. When I was a kid, I was pretty overweight, pretty obese. It just was not fun. Kids joking around. You know how kids are in middle school and high school. It hit home a lot deeper than any of them thought. ♪ Warrior ♪ That's why I go to the gym so much. I want to prove that I can push past what most people won't. And I'm okay with the pain and the suffering that's needed to win The Titan Games. ♪ We're warriors We're warriors ♪ [Liam] So it's the college student versus the stay-at-home dad. Robbie and Bridger are facing a challenge that's easily one of our favorites. [Alex] And they better nail it, because they're facing the Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] This brutal test will challenge all eight muscle groups in your upper body. {\an7}[Liam] You start by swinging the 10-pound hammer against a metal plate, generating upwards of a half a ton of force with every swing {\an7}until it triggers the release of the 350-pound ram. [Alex] From there, it's a test of brute force to see who can break through the massive wooden doors first, pull the victory chain, and claim your spot on Mount Olympus. When opportunity knocks, some people open the door. Titans kick that sumbitch down. Every person you see on this show beat out thousands of others for the opportunity to be standing in the iconic Titan Arena. Bridger, Robbie, your moment has arrived, and the world is watching. This is Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] [Liam] Bridger Buckley, the former football player, in the red. Robbie Straus, dad bod on display in the blue. [Alex] You got to hammer down there in... [Liam] That was quick! He may break a record. [Alex] Wow, I can't even believe that there. I mean, Bridger Buckley's already moving. [Liam] And Straus keeps pounding away. You need to hit the dead center of that post. Meanwhile, Bridger is knocking hard. It's going to break right now. [dramatic music] No? [Alex] Robbie Straus, he finally manages to get it down. [grunts] Bridger's going to break it right now. No. [Liam] Robbie Straus, plenty of ground to make up right now. And having all kinds of problems with the ram. [Alex] You have to be able to get a good grip on the rope, and be able to swing that Hammering Ram efficiently. Robbie is just moving back and forth under the ram. It's going to break right now, bang. No. [laughter] [Liam] And Bridger's looking frustrated here. Right now, you see him standing in place, not moving back and forth. a So the ram is just tapping the barrier, but doesn't have enough force to drive through it. [Liam] Meanwhile, on the other side... [yells] Robbie's trying to use his body weight to pull the ram backwards. [Alex] We saw him doing curls with his boys. He likes to mix things up, and this dad does not quit. I got to go down there. [dramatic music] [Alex] You see DJ here. He's going out. He's motivating these guys, because he knows that they have what it takes to be able to push on through to this door. -Let's go, Robbie! -[Liam] Down to his knees. Don't quit. [Alex] Bridger hasn't cracked it. Robbie still has a shot here. Come on, man. Come on. Bridger Buckley and Robbie Straus are in a war. [dramatic music] Come on, Bridger. Come on. -Go, Bridger! -Go, Bridger! [Alex] You see how tough this challenge is. Swinging that 350-pound ram will wear you down. [yells] Robbie's getting a second wind after trailing the entire challenge. -Now he's right back in this. -Come on, Bridger. Looks like Bridger found his second gear. One more. One more. He battled back after his accident. -Can he break through now? -One more! You got it. [Alex] Just a little bit more! Bridger Buckley, he's right there! [Liam] Get in the castle! Pull that chain! [Alex] Wow! That was a war! And Bridger Buckley pulls through. Good job, man. Whoo! -Good job, brother. -Thank you. Good job. [laughs] Way to hang in. -Thank you. -Yes. [Alex] He's going to Mount Olympus for a chance to become a Titan, and keep himself in the running to become our Titan Champion. [dramatic music] Earlier tonight, we saw an incredible athletic spectacle. [grunts] [Dwayne] It was so inspiring. -I cannot believe this, Liam! -What a comeback here! [Dwayne] Neither of these women would quit. That's what Titan Games are all about. I hope they're both okay. My heart is still racing. Now, the winner of this next challenge will face Melissa on Mount Olympus. Let's meet them both now. {\an7}[Liam] We have hotel executive Carla Miranda. {\an7}At 5 foot even and 105 pounds, she's the smallest competitor in The Titan Games. But Carla can still dead lift 255 pounds, and is proudly representing her home country of Puerto Rico. And she's going up against Nika Sedghi, a mechanical engineer from San Diego. {\an7}[Alex] And Nika is competing to honor her Persian family and the memory of her biggest fan, her grandmother, {\an7}who just recently passed away. Goldenboy, these are clearly two strong, smart women. Now, Carla and Nika will take a crack at our colossal pin cushion. It's time for Tower Drop. [dramatic music] [Alex] DJ engineered this challenge to test balance and arm strength. The objective is to scale a tower that's taller than a streetlight. Along the way, you must generate enough leverage against a vertical wall to remove seven 15-foot long poles. [Liam] At the top, the final golden pole is trapped under a 50-pound weighted ball. If you're first to yank it free, we'll see you at Mount Olympus. On The Titan Games, physical ability is a major component, but it's not everything. For me, it was crucial that timing, strategy, and certainly mental toughness be essential for bringing home a win. So, Nika, Carla, trust your gut, but by no means ignore your brain. This is Tower Drop. [dramatic music] [Liam] Nika in the red. Carla in the blue. Again, at just five feet tall, Carla the smallest competitor at The Titan Games. [Alex] This is going to be awesome! Carla's lighter, {\an7}and she's going to have to use that small frame to go up this tower quickly. Ah, but she's already having problems, as Nika's putting her 5'9" reach to work. [Liam] Upper body, shoulder strength, hand strength. It's all there for Nika. Go, Nika! [Liam] And Nika has three poles out. Carla, only one. [Alex] Yeah, Carla is struggling a little bit to get on top of that next pole there. [dramatic music] She's a little hung up, but still manages to reach backwards and pull out that pole. As that's happening, though, you have Nika, who's already halfway up the tower. Carla needs to make some progress. [Liam] This climb takes balance and flexibility. {\an7}You have to reach those poles without slipping off the tower. That's three for Carla, five for Nika, and they're moving on up. [cheers and applause] Again, eight poles in all that are preventing the ball from falling down that 28-foot tower and releasing the victory chain. {\an7}[Alex] And Carla just pulled four and five back to back! Whoa, almost falls! And now Nika's back in the lead. -Good, Nika. {\an7}-She's right up near the top. [Liam] Nika, she says as a gas turbine engineer, {\an7}she's here representing all {\an7}the nerdy engineers out there, and she is inches away from being at that golden pole. [dramatic music] [grunts] [clanging] [Alex] Seven's down, but Carla is fighting back. Only two more to go! [Liam] Nearly 28 feet up, {\an7}and Nika's at the Golden Pole. {\an7}[Alex] Got a little bit stuck, though. This is where things get really dicey. [Liam] Remember, it's right under that 50-pound ball. It doesn't slide as easily. [Alex] She's going to have to reposition herself to get a better angle on that golden pole. {\an7}This could give Carla the time she needs to catch up. Carla's tied it up! Here comes Puerto Rico! [Liam] Nika said she loves to solve problems. Can the engineer pull {\an7}the last piece of this puzzle? [Alex] Carla's at the golden pole! But Nika's got it! The ball drops! She just needs to pull that victory chain on top of the tower, and that is going to do it! [dramatic music] -Yes! {\an7}-[Liam] Nika surged to the top, and now, she is on her way to Mount Olympus. {\an7}But we have some breaking news about her opponent, Melissa Alcantara. You can see her there backstage {\an7}being helped out of the arena. She is unable to put any weight on her left leg. Right now, Melissa is a serious question mark when it comes to competing on Mount Olympus. We're going to get an update. Don't go anywhere. [dramatic music] [Liam] It was one of the most heroic performances we've seen on The Titan Games. -Worse than giving birth, wow. -[laughs] And now, we have breaking news about Melissa Alcantara. Cari Champion is backstage with Melissa now, and has the update. Cari? {\an7}So, Melissa, you had, arguably, the best battle that {\an7}we've seen so far this season. What happened? While I was up there, it was crazy adrenaline. But as soon as I came down, my knee flared up. It's super swollen. I can't bend it. I could hardly move it. It's... It's over for me. But you gave a lot of people a lot of hope tonight. You're still a champion. [laughs] -Thank you. -Thank you. Back to you guys. Such a tough break. We were all looking forward to seeing what Melissa could do on Mount Olympus. And that means her opponent, Christina Luna, according to our rules, will step up to face Nika Sedghi on Mount Olympus. [Liam] We'll see that matchup later, but right now, on the starting line, we have Steven Hoppe, {\an7}a firefighter from Arizona... And Montez Blair, a business consultant from New Jersey. [somber music] [Cari] Montez grew up in poverty, but buried his nose in his books and reached the Ivy League, becoming a track star at Cornell and one of the elite high-jumpers in the country. Montez has never smoked or had a drink in his life, and feels like that intense focus well help him become a Titan. I've worked hard, both academically and athletically throughout my entire life just to get to this point. I wasn't going to ever stop fighting for the dream. The Titan Games are about pushing your body to its limits. There's something I feel like I have, and it's going to push me to the next level. If you haven't gone through the life experience that I have, you don't know what it takes to sacrifice. Come here, you. In 2016, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage two. You know, you always have the weak moments when you're going through stuff like that. My biggest thing was probably my son. Ready? up. The hardest thing for me was just to look in to him while he's sleeping, and just have... ...that thought that he might not have a dad. I made it a point that day seven after I had my chemo done that I was back in the gym. For me, The Titan Games is all about living, breathing what I'm teaching my kids about overcoming adversity. -One. -One! Two! Titan Games, here we come. I'm just a Titan of my own life. I'm 38 years old. I've gone through cancer. I feel like I'm invincible. [cheers and applause] [Liam] Steven and Montez are about to do battle on Uprising. The goal is to pull a 40-pound anvil up a 30-foot tower. [Alex] But there's a Titan-sized twist. We've placed five solid floors in the way. [Liam] Let's kick things off. DJ? Montez, Steven, all I want is all you got. This is Uprising. [dramatic music] [Liam] Montez in the red. Steven in the blue. And they both break right through that first barrier. [Alex] And there goes the second level for Steven! But now it gets even tougher. That third floor is twice as thick. Montez was an elite track star at Cornell, but he never ran with a 40-pound anvil on his back. And Steven, he's running at him with everything he has. Go, go, go, go, go. Come on, babe. Come on, babe. [dramatic music] [Liam] The anvil is pulling you up, and you lose all momentum when it hits the floor, so you need to stay low and use short steps. And Hoppe is charging like a bull here! [Alex] Steven managed to break through! Oh, my God! He went through the double layer and the fourth layer. [chuckles] Let's go, boys. [grunts] [Alex] One more layer for Steven Hoppe, and he is your winner! [dramatic music] -Whoo! -Yeah! Wow. Daddy! [Liam] It's an emotional victory for Steven Hoppe. This father of four {\an7}is moving on to Mount Olympus for the chance to become a Titan. How does one become a Titan? Being an incredible athlete? That's important. Having a ton of heart? That's mandatory. Winning your competition? Well, that's vital, but it's certainly not enough. In the end, the only way to become a Titan is to conquer Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] Mount Olympus is the crown jewel in the Titan Arena. From the strength required to push over a half-ton wall and drive 450 pounds up a 25-degree incline... to the agility to climb over six spinning cylinders each wider than a redwood tree... {\an7}each stage of Mount Olympus {\an7}has been specifically designed to test all aspects of athleticism. If you have a weakness, {\an7}the mountain's gonna reveal it. Prove that you can conquer my mountain, and you join my team of Titans. [cheers and applause] Next up is a showdown of epic proportions. It's our two comeback kids. Bridger changed his life after a very tragic accident, and Steven beat cancer into submission. Now use what brought you here, and prepare to push yourself like never before. It's time to get to work. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Steven in the blue. Bridger in the red. [Alex] And just like that, Steven Hoppe, he shatters that 1,000-pound wall. But Bridger is right on his tail. [cheers and applause] [Liam] Incredible upper-body strength from both of these men. Now, they're into the Rolling Ascent, and this is all about speed and agility. [grunts] [Alex] Bridger Buckley, he stumbles! [Liam] And Hoppe takes the lead. Now he's at The Cliffs. This is where you have to punch and kick your own holes and climb to the top. Go, go, go, go, go. The firefighter gets punching first, but Bridger is right behind him. Get up that wall! [dramatic music] And these heavyweights are obliterating this wall right now. [Alex] Hoppe's near the top, but look at Bridger! He's just blasting his way up! Both of these men have made it up to the top of Mount Olympus at the same exact time. This is close! [Liam] Now it's time to grind away, raise the torch, 600 pounds. [grunts] -Bridge! -Come on, push! [Alex] You have to keep constant pressure on the wheel. One slip, and that torch will come crashing down. And just like that, Bridger Buckley steals the lead. And now Hoppe fires it up. Let's go, Steven! Get down here to me! [Alex] And this matchup continues in breakneck fashion. [grunts] [Liam] Three walls... five, six, seven feet tall. All right, Bridger, come on. [Alex] 22-year-old Bridger bounced over that final wall. But Hoppe, who is 38 and a cancer survivor, is still hanging with him. [Liam] Now, the 250-pound ball and chain. We know it's about strength, but we've learned it's just as much about technique. Bridger's backing it up, and you can see how close Hoppe is right now. [cheers and applause] [Alex] And Steven Hoppe grabs it with one arm, and he is dragging it across the arena! This guy survived five months of chemotherapy. There's no chance he's quitting now. [Liam] Firefighter strength there from Steven Hoppe. He chops down doors with an ax. Now that tomb's taking a beating. Bridger, go! [Alex] It is such a close race. [cheers and applause] Go, go, go, go, go, go! Now Bridger's gonna try and dig out that relic. But Hoppe's still pounding away! Bridger keeps digging! Where is the relic? Now Hoppe's right there. -[Alex] Yes! -He's got it. [Alex] Bridger Buckley has the relic, and he is locking it in! [cheers and applause] Hoppe was so close, but Bridger Buckley is your next Titan! -Yes! -Whoo! [Alex] Oh, my God. -Congratulations, brother. -Thank you. Great job. -That was crazy! -Yeah! -Oh, my God! -My baby boy! -Whoo! -[Alex] Tremendous race. He took silver in the Arena tonight. But a kiss from his baby girl? That's pure gold, Liam. [cheers and applause] -You've earned this one, man. -Thank you. -Congratulations, brother. -Thank you. Great job. Becoming a Titan isn't the finishing line. That would be too easy. At the end of the season, all our winners will return for the Battle of the Titans, and when the last battle has been fought, one woman and one man will have the distinction of becoming the very first ever Titan Champions. [cheers and applause] Facing the mountain right now, it's our incredibly competitive engineer, Nika Sedghi, versus our fiercely determined dental hygienist, Christina Luna. [dramatic music] I'm looking forward to utilizing my strength, my speed, agility. I have no doubt that Grandma is looking down on me, smiling, telling me to fear nothing. [Alex] Nika gets on top of the tower, and that is going to do it! It's my time to represent everything Melissa and I stand for as mothers. If I ever have a team, you're on it. -Go, Christina! -[Liam And look at this. Melissa Alcantara can't compete, but she came back to cheer for Christina, who's representing both of them. The wait's over now. Let's go to DJ. It is undeniable that these women are the embodiment of The Titan Games. They are fearless, they are relentless, and they are absolutely inspiring. Nika, Christina, you know what you have to do. Attack this challenge like every challenge in life that's come before you. You walked through the fire. Now, it's time to burn it all to the ground. [dramatic music] [Alex] Here we go! [Liam] Nika in the red. Christina in the blue. Full throttle from the start. [grunts] [Alex] Let's see how they tackle the 1,000-pound wall. [grunts] Nika is going to topple the wall first. Whoo! And Christina Luna, she's right behind. Let's go! Come on! [Liam] They're at the Gates of Olympus, and it's more uphill strength. [Alex] Stacked up, it's 450 pounds. [grunts] [dramatic music] [Liam] Now Nika is through and heads right into the Rolling Ascent. [Alex] This is going to be difficult. You have to have the agility to go up these wheels. [Liam] Christina, she's through as well. She's onto the Rolling Ascent. Come on! Go! Push! [Alex] Christina struggling as she jumps to that third one. [grunts] [Liam] Nika launches herself over. There you go, Nika. [grunts] Again, you have to punch or kick your own holes. And Nika, the engineer, smashing her path to the top. [Alex] And now Christina Luna is right behind Nika. There you go. Look at Nika! She's even taking a knee to the wall! Christina Luna is right there. But Nika reaches the top. Come on. Let's break it. [Liam] Nika trying to raise the torch, 600 pounds, 25 feet tall. Punch that wall. [Liam] All those years of training. All those hours in the gym. This is where that dedication pays off. [Alex] Oh, she's blasting those biceps right now. [dramatic music] But Nika Sedghi does accomplish the task, and she raises the torch. Now it's time to fly down Mount Olympus. [Liam] But here comes Christina. We saw it on Lunar Impact. She'll fight to the end. Whoo! [Alex] Nika Sedghi, she's going down Mount Olympus here. [heavy breathing] [Liam] And there's Nika. She is on the floor of Titan Arena. Christina, just a few more cranks to go. [Alex] Now, the ball and chain, 200 pounds. And look at that power! Are you kidding me? [Liam] This is unbelievable. Unbelievable. [dramatic music] Good, Nika. She knows that she has the lead, and she just needs to end it right here, right now! And the torch is lit for Christina Luna! She's on her way down. Christina Luna has to go. She has to fly. [Liam] There it is! [Alex] Nika Sedghi, with her grandmother looking above her, she knows she could do it, because she is a Titan! [dramatic music] -Congratulations. -I hope I made you proud. Did it. Great job. Go see your family. [Alex] What a run from both of these women. [laughter] You did it! You did it! You did it! Grandma, she did it for you! It's yours! I tried. I'm sorry I didn't win for us. I'm so sorry. You won. Listen. You won a long time ago. All right, cool. You have earned this, Nika. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Let me fix that. You are a Titan. Thank you very, very much. [Liam] So a gas turbine engineer and a college student will continue on in the competition. And we'll see them when all of our Titans return for the Battle of the Titans. In the end, we'll crown one man and one woman Titan Champions. Right before she did this, she said, "I'm going to make you proud, sir." And that's exactly what she did. Whoo! Join us next time on The Titan Games. Your new Titan. [cheers and applause] [dramatic music]
