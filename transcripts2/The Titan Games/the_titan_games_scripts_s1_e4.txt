 How you deal with it and overcome it, well, that's what makes a Titan. From age 21 to 23, I was self-medicating with alcohol. At that point, I said "I have to stop drinking." I give life everything I have now. -♪ Let's be ♪ -[Alex] Let's go! ♪ Iconic, let's defeat

Yes! Let's have some fun. Here we go. [dramatic music] Welcome to Titan Arena. {\an7}You know, I have to tell you, these games have already exceeded my expectations, and you guys know my expectations {\an7}were very high to begin with. [cheers and applause] So let's get started. Helping me out tonight here in the Titan Arena, the one, the only. Here is Cari Champion. [dramatic music] All right, thanks, DJ. This is a battle between two guys who have serious day jobs, and they're pretty serious athletes. One's a lawyer who's also a expert martial artist. The other? Well, he's a business analyst who's all business when it comes to fitness. [groovy music] Reaching The Titan Games requires perseverance, and business analyst Kwame Sarfo has been tested. I thought, "First job out of college, I'm going to get $100,000 and buy that new car." It didn't work out like that, so for about ten weeks, I found myself living in the back of my car. It was a tough time, but it helped me build my character. [cheering] I started recording myself doing these crazy pushups on Instagram, and it just blew up. People loved it. Got about a million views in three days. Where is Kwame Sarfo? And then Ellen liked it. She brought me on. [cheers and applause] [groovy music] What... What's happening? Oh, my God! That took me to 11 million views on the Internet, which was amazing. But it's time for the world to see that I'm not just the push-up guy. There's more to me than push-ups. [Cari] Kwame works full time as a business analyst, and still finds a way to hit the gym 14 times a week. [dramatic music] A Titan is someone that's made, made from circumstances, made from things that happen in life. I've put in the time. I've put in the sweat, the effort. The Titan Games are what I'm meant for. I will be a Titan. [dramatic music] [Cari] Some people are satisfied being a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Lawyer Derik Scott wants to master everything. I want to find my limit physically, mentally, every single day. Because if I'm not finding my limit, then I'm leaving something on the table. ♪ Burn it up Got the fire in me ♪ ♪ Nothing's stopping My victory ♪ [Cari] Derik has competed in wrestling, diving, karate, and gymnastics. From the time I was four years old, I could do a backflip. [Cari] He recently had his first professional MMA fight. Competing in professional fights is about as close as you can get to getting into a arena and being a gladiator or a Titan. [announcer] Derik Scott! When the bell rings, I can compete at peak performance and be ready for anything. That is going to help me win The Titan Games. ♪ Yeah, it's going down Undefeated ♪ [cheers and applause] Hello, everyone. I'm Liam McHugh, with my partner Alex "Goldenboy" Mendez. Our competitors better run for cover with this next challenge, Alex. {\an7}That's right. There's nowhere {\an7}to hide from the Cyclone. With this deranged test of core strength and stability, you'll need to whip around a suspended 60-pound wrecking ball. The goal is to knock over all five pillars that are each nearly two stories tall. [Liam] The challenge is as the circumference of the ball's path increases, it will require even more strength to maintain control. First to topple all five pillars makes the cut for Mount Olympus. [cheers and applause] Sometimes, life takes a big swing and knocks you down, but no matter how bad it looks, every one of us has the power to pick ourselves up and swing back. I wanted this challenge to literally be one of those times. So Kwame, Derik, take charge, and come out swinging. This is Cyclone. [dramatic music] [Liam] Derik Scott, he's in the red. Kwame Sarfo in the blue. You have the five pillars and the 60-pound wrecking ball. {\an7}-Who can get them down first? -Come on! [Alex] Derik's actually going to manage to take one down right away, and then Kwame, right behind him as well, Liam. [Liam] Here's what makes this challenge so tough, Goldenboy. If you don't keep constant tension on the rope, the ball will keep moving back towards the middle. [grunting] And Derik gets his second one. [Alex] Derik has the right idea. He's backing himself around, staying in line with the path of the ball. Derik just hit another one! They're kicking ass. Whoo! You got this! It's getting there. Come on. [grunting] [Liam] Derik Scott, three down. And Kwame gets his second. And Derik strikes again! He's got four down. Incredible! [Alex] Kwame is a master of push-ups, but he can't get control of that rope right now. Derik Scott, the lawyer and fighter, is one pillar away from his shot to become a Titan. [Liam] Kwame, the business analyst, connects with number three. He's finding his rhythm. Derik Scott, reeling in the slack, -is coming back around. -[Alex] One more pillar. [grunts] -[Liam] And there it goes! -[yelling] [dramatic music] Yes, baby! Let's get it! -Wow! -Derik's fired up. He did great. Whoo! -[Liam] Derik Scott... -[yells] has himself a court date with Mount Olympus. It's the first of our four challenges tonight. The two men and two women that win will face off for the chance to become a Titan and continue on in this competition. [dramatic music] We're here at The Titan Games at Titan Arena, the monstrosity that we built for the biggest athletic competition show in the history of TV. And here's what makes this special, the people. [cheers and applause] Welcome to The Titan Games. [laughs] Uh, what I wanted to do with this competition... this crowd is crazy, by the way... is inspire people to become Titans in their own lives. And judging by the energy in this arena tonight, I think it's working. You guys feeling good? [cheers and applause] You guys ready to have some fun? [crowd cheering] Yes! And do it completely naked. [cheers and applause] [laughs] By the way, that was completely hypothetical. Keep your clothes on, all right? Especially you, Goldenboy. Okay. Now, let's get on to another battle. Here we go. All right, DJ, these next two competitors are not just brave, but they're fierce. One's a horse whisperer who crushes 50-mile obstacle course races, and the other overcame addiction and found a new life through fitness. [dramatic music] Three years ago, Melody Schofield was a long way from competing in The Titan Games. Her battle was with alcohol addiction. It became an extremely normal thing to me to just have a glass of wine or a shot in the morning to feel normal. At that point, I said "I have to stop drinking." I give life everything I have now. I train four hours a day, five days a week. I'm never going to drink again. Now I'm a certified recovery specialist. Being able to help people where I was is extremely rewarding to me. [soft music] -[phone rings] -Hello? I'm looking for somebody named Melody. I am a huge fan of Dwayne. -Hi. -Melody, Dwayne Johnson. -How are you? -Oh, my God. I'm freaking out, actually. But I'm amazing. Uh, I hear they call you The Pebble. Yes, they do! My nickname, it's The Pebble, because I look like a female version of The Rock, just a smaller version. I want to say congratulations and welcome. Oh, my God! [laughter] That's a lot of good emotions right there for Melody. [Cari] Becoming a Titan doesn't mean spending endless hours in the gym. Christiana Rugloski spends most of her time outdoors, and she's constantly moving. I work at an equi-therapy facility... You're a real cowboy. with children and adults with physical and mental disabilities. Remember to slide your hands down your reins a little bit. -Good. -♪ You're looking for ♪ My job is very physical, and I love being outside. I enjoy the manual labor, you know? You're working with dirty stuff, heavy stuff, but it's really satisfying to me. [Cari] The freedom Christiana feels in nature is a stark contrast to her upbringing as one of eight homeschooled siblings in an ultra-conservative religious household. My parents wanted to shelter us and protect us. We're not allowed to wear pants or anything, like, form-fitting. Or to play sports, get strong, you know? All that kind of stuff. I realized I wasn't content with how things were, and I wanted to get out there, do things. ♪ No fear of letting go They're in the ever glow ♪ ♪ Go get what you want Go get what you want ♪ You got it, Chris. You got it, Chris. At 19, Christiana moved out and began pursuing her athletic dreams. Incredibly, within a year, she had won three obstacle course competitions and qualified for world championships. I need to just keep challenging myself, and keep pushing myself, and this is the next thing. -I'm going to be a Titan. -♪ What you want ♪ [cheers and applause] [Liam] Just think where these two women were a few years ago. Christiana was still living at home, and Melody was still struggling with addiction. Now they're facing off here in Titan Arena on a challenge we love. {\an7}We call it the Herculean Pull. DJ wanted to create a challenge where you outleverage an opponent you can't even see. {\an7}[Liam] First you use grip strengh and upper-body power to unthread two 100-pound silver poles, each longer than a pickup truck. [Alex] Next is a blind tug of war with the golden pole, and you can't use the ground for help. [Liam] Whoever can hang on and generate the most force will hit the target and punch their ticket to Mount Olympus. My goal in The Titan Games was to crown real-life superheroes. Now, real-life superheroes, they don't wear capes or fight aliens. They get up every morning, they put in the work with their own two hands, sometimes calloused. Then they do it all over again for the ones they love. Melody, Christiana, no capes. Just pure grit. This is Herculean Pull. [dramatic music] {\an7}[Liam] Christiana in the red. Melody in the blue. And they go for silver poles on opposite sides. [Alex] Christiana strikes first. That was quick. Melody right behind. One more, and they can go for that gold to decide the winner. Oh, Melody thought she had it, but there's a little more to go. [grunting] [Liam] Wow, Christiana got both poles out and is on to the golden pole. Melody better get moving here. [Alex] Oh, no! Melody's struggling! Oh, my God, Melody's got to get up there! She's got to grab it! [grunting] [dramatic music] Are you kidding me? I'm pretty sure Christiana just set a record for the Herculean Pull. It was amazing. [Liam] Christiana, homeschooled. Wasn't allowed to play sports growing up. She's moving on to Mount Olympus. So glad I got to meet you. Yeah, it was good to meet you, too. -Oh, God, nice to meet you. -Yeah, you did great. -Thank you so much. -Absolutely. [dramatic music] So I challenged my team of designers to create the most intense, brutal, twisted form of bowling ever imagined. The result is the Cyclone. {\an7}Set 'em up, knock 'em down, {\an7}win a ticket to Mount Olympus. I can't wait to see this one again. Time for our next battle. Oh, my God. Nope. It's all right. You know what? I'm sorry, guys. It was arm day. It's arm day. All right, DJ's working out. Now these ladies are working out. {\an7}Competing now are two strong, smart women on a mission One is a bioengineer and {\an7}a record-holding powerlifter. The other is a preschool teacher who's also a phenomenal athlete. [dramatic music] Just five feet tall, Nichole Root is the shortest woman in the entire competition, and at 39, she's one of the oldest. ♪ Yeah, I'm the queen Of the kill ♪ But this California preschool teacher has been dominating obstacle course competitions, setting an inspiring example for her teenage daughters. When I was 18, I found out I was pregnant. I felt a lot of pressure being a young mom. I was waiting tables, and it was really overwhelming. I had my two daughters, but at the same time, that gave me direction. And so I just tried really hard to be a good mom. ♪ I hope you're ready for Ready for, ready for action ♪ My oldest is 19, and my baby's going to be 17. The greatest reward is just watching my daughters succeed. All of my greatest accomplishments are hands-down something my children have done. ♪ I hope you're ready For action ♪ I'm competing for my daughters. I'm competing for myself. I will be a Titan. [cheers and applause] I love you! [Liam] Nichole's younger daughter, Gwen, is here tonight to provide support, and Mom is going to need it {\an7}because she's going up against powerhouse opponent 36-year-old Emily Hu. [dramatic music] People always look at me and think, "Oh, what a small, cute little girl. She probably doesn't know what she's doing in the gym." And then, usually, they're surprised that I can outlift them. ♪ Go, go ♪ ♪ This is what It sound like ♪ ♪ This is What it sound like ♪ [Cari] Emily Hu loves crushing stereotypes both in her Silicon Valley job as a bioengineer, and as a competitive powerlifter. Being a strong woman, we're told it's not feminine, or this is not the way a woman should be. For me, being normal means working in tech and being a powerlifter. Then going home and getting dressed up and going out. Why can't everyone do both? [grunts] Amazingly, Emily didn't start training until she was 30 and couldn't do a single pull-up or push-up the first time she entered the gym. I put in the time, and I put in the work. At my peak, I have three world records. I was 120 pounds when I benched 275 pounds. I have high expectations of myself. ♪ Put your hands up ♪ ♪ This is what It sound like ♪ I'm here to show women that you can still be strong and feminine. I will be a Titan. {\an7}Our next two competitors are {\an7}two incredibly tenacious women. Emily, Nichole, it's time to shine. This is Cyclone. [dramatic music] [Liam] Instant adrenaline rush. [Alex] Let's go! [grunts] [grunts] [Liam] Step one, get that wrecking ball moving. And Emily, with those strength training world records, has a clear edge in power. [Alex] Nichole has the endurance of a distance runner, but will that help here? [Liam] One goes down right there for Nichole Root. [Alex] Nichole Root has an early lead. [dramatic music] And Emily takes one down as well. [Liam] Both have one, and there's another one down there for Nichole Root. Come on! You know she has a strategy. She's a preschool teacher. She's got to wrangle a bunch of toddlers. She came in here with a plan. [grunting] [Alex] Now she knocks down a third pillar. I cannot believe what we're seeing. I thought Emily would crush this. -Wh-What's going on? -[Liam] Well, you can see the problem is that Emily's standing in place, and the ball's simply not swinging wide enough. This is a killer core workout. [Alex] Nichole just got number four! This preschool teacher is crushing a champion powerlifter! Whoo! Go! Come on! [grunting] [Liam] And Emily finally gets number two. -[grunting] -And three! She just cut down two in one swing. That takes power. [grunting] Nichole only needs one more, but Emily is finding her rhythm. [Alex] Emily is so close, but Nichole, she's coming around again. And connects! [dramatic music] -Wow. -[screams] Yes! [cheering] [Liam] Like she'd been preparing for this her entire life, the preschool teacher graduates to Mount Olympus. [Alex] It all came down to technique. Emily stood in place {\an7}and whipped the wrecking ball around her head. But it couldn't reach the pillars. Now look at Nichole. She kept pace with the ball all the way around the ring. The centrifugal force sent the ball wide, and took the pillars out. [heavy breathing] I love you! Good job! [Liam] So 39-year-old Nichole Root will face 21-year-old Christiana Rugloski on Mount Olympus, and the winner continues on in our competition for a chance to become our Titan champion. [dramatic music] With The Titan Games, I wanted to showcase a group of people who demonstrate extraordinary strength in their everyday lives and give them a platform. But not just any platform, a state-of-the-art, unforgiving, groundbreaking, ridiculous, badass, "Sweet Lord Almighty, what is that thing?" kind of platform. We call it Mount Olympus. Time to see who gets to play on it next. Both of these athletes are bringing something to the table tonight. {\an7}One's on a mission to show {\an7}other people with disabilities that nothing is out of their reach. The other has a winning combination of brains and brawn. Dwayne Johnson, I'm going to be the best Titan you have. ["Believer" playing] There's no weight I can't lift. There's no wall I can't climb. There's no hurdle I can't overcome. [Cari] Chris Ruden's confidence comes from his remarkable strength despite a lifetime of struggling to fit in. ♪ I was broken From a young age ♪ I was born with two fingers on my left hand, and a shorter left arm. I thought I was destined to not be anything. I spent 17 years hiding my disability. I was with my girlfriend for three years before she saw my hand. I just took my glove off and showed my hand to the world less than a year ago. ♪ Hey, you made me a You made me a believer ♪ ♪ Believer ♪ When I got into powerlifting, I won six out of seven meets I've done. I broke four state records, an unofficial world record. I fell in love with the feeling of "I can succeed regardless of what circumstance I was given." I'm a youth motivational speaker. Showing a kid who thought there's no hope that there is hope is my driving factor for being on The Titan Games. ♪ Pain ♪ Everyone goes through some sort of struggle, some sort of adversity. Don't hide. Take your glove off. Unleash the greatness you have. I'm a Titan, because I'll never quit. I'll crush anyone you put in front of me. ♪ Pain, you made me a You made me a believer ♪ ♪ Believer ♪ [upbeat music] [Cari] 20-year-old college student Jack Kwan is the youngest athlete in The Titan Games, but what really makes him stand out is his gravity-defying hair. To do my hair, it takes me about 30 minutes. It's just like training any other muscle. You got to force your hair to get taller. You got to push it down, and then you gotta push it back up. Perfect. [Cari] As the youngest of five siblings, Jack has always craved the spotlight. I was constantly trying to get my parents's attention, and so I took it on my own to teach myself dance tricks, flips, and maneuvers. Jack continues to explore body movement as a kinesiology major at the University of Wisconsin. At 180 pounds, Jack's one of our smaller competitors, but he refuses to be outworked. I push my body to my limits. Any sort of training, whether it's gymnastics, bodybuilding, parkour, I'm here to show people what I've been working on my entire life. This is an opportunity of a lifetime, and I'm going to take advantage of it. [cheers and applause] [Liam] It was 50 years ago that man first set foot on the moon. Tonight Jack and Chris are about to take another thrilling space walk. [Alex] That's right, Liam. It's time to launch Lunar Impact. [dramatic music] Afraid of heights? Well, too bad! {\an7}Lunar Impact's action happens 30 feet in the air. [Liam] First, we're testing speed and agility as you race up a ladder that's three stories tall. Then, you ue your lower-body power to drive the sliding wall and push your opponent off the narrow, crescent-shaped bridge. [Alex] Last one standing is headed to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] {\an7}[Liam] Oh, and Chris is going to remove his prosthetic. {\an7}He told us earlier he actually climbs faster without it. [Alex] For Jack, speed is his best weapon. He doesn't want to let Chris start pushing that wall before him with his raw power. [Liam] We are ready for liftoff. Take it away, DJ. I could tell you how much determination and toughness are required for this next challenge. I could make a fancy metaphor about reaching for the stars, but I'm not. Instead, I'll just say this. Chris, Jack, you know the stakes. You only get one chance at this, so focus at the task at hand, and hold back nothing. In other words, grit it out. This is Lunar Impact. [dramatic music] [Liam] And it starts with that 30-foot ladder. [Alex] Chris off to a great start here, but, oh, my goodness! Look at Jack! He's flying! And he manages to get on top of Lunar Impact first. Chris Ruden has to get on top right now. [dramatic music] Oh! Oh, my God! [Liam] It is over! What an upset. Jack Kwan didn't even give Ruden a chance to display that brute strength. I am blown away. [Liam] That speed and that agility, unreal. 20-year-old Jack Kwan is moving on to Mount Olympus. [Alex] It all came down to this. Have you ever seen anyone climb a ladder like that? Jack flew up 30 feet in just eight seconds. He knew he needed to reach that wall first to have a chance against Ruden's raw power. [Liam] It was {\an7}a disappointing run for Chris, but just being here sent a powerful message of perseverance, and he's standing by with Cari. Did you ever think you'd be here at this place right here in this arena? I never thought I would take my glove off and show people my disability. I'm here for every kid that's afraid of being different, every kid that's afraid of the way they look or the way they are. I'm here to show that it's possible. I lost, but I feel like I did my job, and I hope every kid in America knows limitations are self-imposed. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you for being such a wonderful example for what The Titan Games are all about. Thank you so much, and thank you to The Rock. Thank you. Thank you. Great job, brother. Thank you. Thank you. -I appreciate that. -Great job. Great job. [dramatic music] [Liam] So our pairings are set, Jack Kwan versus Derik Scott and Christiana Rugloski versus Nichole Root. They're all headed to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] I designed Mount Olympus to test every fiber of athleticism and heart within our competitors. Conquering it is the only way to prove you're worthy of being a Titan. [dramatic music] Mount Olympus is the crown jewel in the Titan Arena. From the strength required to push over a half-ton wall and drive 450 pounds up a 25-degree incline, to the agility to climb over six spinning cylinders each wider than a redwood tree, {\an7}each stage of Mount Olympus {\an7}has been specifically designed to test all aspects of athleticism. If you have a weakness, the mountain's gonna reveal it. Prove that you can conquer my mountain, and you join my Team of Titans. [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] Now, the fighting lawyer, Derik Scott, and the boy wonder, Jack Kwan, go head-to-head. [dramatic music] My strategy going into Mount Olympus is just to be as quick as possible. [Alex] Oh! Oh, my God! I'm going to leave everything on the line. -[Liam] Unreal. -And I have to become a Titan. My agility, athleticism, gymnastics is on par if not better than his is. [Alex] This hard-hitting, MMA-fighting lawyer. But my strength is significantly better. [yells] It literally feels like this competition was made for me. [cheers and applause] Derik, Jack, this is going to test you, possibly break you both physically and mentally. There's nothing left to say except it's time to get to work. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Derik, the lawyer, in the red, Jack, the college student, in the blue at the 1,000-pound wall. [Alex] Here we go, baby! And Jack shatters that wall, but Derik not far behind. [yells] Just listen to Jack! He's getting primal pushing those Gates of Olympus. [yells] [Liam] Stacked up, it's 450 pounds. Derik crushed them. He's moving on to Rolling Ascent. [Alex] And Jack is right on his tail. [grunting] I mean, you're seeing just the agility come into play here, and Derik flies up it! He's already at The Cliffs. Oh, and you know an MMA fighter is gonna love punching and kicking his own path to the top. Wow. -[Liam] Jack's struggling. -[Alex] Oh, no! [grunts] [Liam] Meanwhile, Derik Scott is jumping and punching, but he still hasn't started climbing. [yells] [Alex] Oh, Jack body-slams past Rolling Ascent! Go, go, go, go, go! [Alex] He's gotta make up ground. -We know he's fast. -[yells] [Liam] Remember, you've got to make your own ladder here. Derik has, and he's up and over. [dramatic music] Yes! Go, D! Go! [grunts] [Alex] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Jack Kwan's wild ride up the mountain continues. [grunts] Derik now over to raise the torch. [Liam] 600 pounds. [grunting] And Derik is using his entire body to keep that crank moving. [Alex] Jack is struggling on The Cliffs. [Liam] The holes he's making are too big. You need tiny holes to get just your feet, your hands, and you use them to climb up. [grunts] Derik Scott raises his torch. -Whoo! -Let's go! [Liam] It's time for that 60-foot descent. Three walls... five feet, six feet, and seven feet. [Alex] He's doing somersaults down the mountain! [dramatic music] But here comes Jack! Made it up to the top of Mount Olympus, but he needs to hurry up. [grunts] [Liam] Derik tumbles over the last one. Look at this. Thumbs up and smiles already. He should realize Jack Kwan is not out of this. [grunts] -The torch is lit. -Come on! [Alex] Derik may be a lawyer, but this isn't a done deal. This ball weighs 250 pounds. [Liam] He is just struggling. [Alex] And look at this! Here comes Jack! You said it, Liam. You can't celebrate early. [Liam] Look, there are seven stages on Mount Olympus, and you got to conquer every one of them. Right now, that ball and chain is like an anchor for Derik Scott. Come on! [dramatic music] [Alex] Derik Scott needs to hurry up, because Jack is right on his tail! [Liam] Yeah, this is Jack's chance to catch up, -and there he is. -[Alex] Just like that, Jack Kwan is back in this race. -Come on, Jack. Bring it! -Go, pull! [Liam] Jack Kwan looks exhausted. [Alex] But this college kid knows he can't quit. The pain will go away, but Titan glory lasts forever. [grunting] [Liam] Oh, man, Mount Olympus is taking its toll. And Jack is closing in. -Pull, Jack, pull! -Pull! [Alex] Look at Jack's face! That's how hard it is to become a Titan. [groans] [grunts] [Liam] Derik Scott is at the Titan tomb. He needs to pull that ball and chain just a little bit more so he has the leverage to swing through. [Alex] Jack Kwan is right there! Come on! [Liam] Derik hammering away! Come on, D! [dramatic music] He's cracked through! [Alex] Derik Scott is looking for the relic. Jack has to hurry up! Where's the key? [groans] [Liam] Jack Kwan can barely lift the hammer right now. There it is! [Alex] Derik Scott, he's got the relic! He's going to lock it in in front of DJ, and he is a Titan! [screams] [Liam] Derik Scott. Lawyer, fighter, and now Titan. [both scream] [cheers and applause] -Congratulations. -Thanks, dude. Congratulations. Go see your family. [dramatic music] -I love you so much! -I love you, too. [laughs] [Alex] This run was a perfect reminder of just how nasty Mount Olympus can be. They slipped, fell, and went through pure hell. [Liam] But that's what it takes to become a Titan. And now Derik is standing by with Cari. Congratulations, Derik. You are a Titan. -Yeah. -How does that feel? It's better than any fight I've ever won. This feels so amazing, just because how much that course really did test you. That boulder was, whoa, like, stupid heavy. [laughter] You've been amazing tonight. Congratulations. You are a Titan, and you are headed -to the Battle of the Titans. -Fantastic. Thank you so much. [dramatic music] You're probably wondering how we crown our ultimate winners. Well, here's how it's gonna work. At the end of the season, all the Titans will return for the epic Battle of the Titans. And when the last battle has been fought, one man and one woman will each become undisputed Titan Champions. Now, the horse whisperer, Christiana Rugloski, and the preschool teacher, Nichole Root, face off on Mount Olympus. They're coming off tremendous victories, but only one will emerge a Titan. [cheers and applause] [dramatic music] I didn't really have the chance to be involved in athletics growing up. [Liam] Christiana tearing through this. Becoming a Titan would prove that I can do anything that I set my mind to. I'm gonna beat the competition, because I don't quit. [Alex] Nichole Root already establishing dominance early on. If I just take a little bit of all the love and support and belief that everybody else has in me, I think absolutely anything is possible. [cheers and applause] Two powerhouses, one crown. Something's got to give. Christiana, Nichole, it's time to take what you came for. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Christiana in the red. Nichole in the blue. These are obstacle course endurance athletes, but their strength will be tested immediately here at the 1,000 pound wall. {\an7}[Alex] Technique is key here. They're both trying to get it rocking like a giant domino. Christiana is through! And Nichole is right behind. Now it's over to the Gates of Olympus. [Liam] Those gates are 150 pounds each. Nichole only weighs 125. So with all three stacked, she's pushing three and a half times her body weight uphill. [grunts] [Alex] And Christiana is done. She's on to the Rolling Ascent. [whooping] [dramatic music] Meanwhile, Nichole is {\an7}still struggling on the Gates. She's even putting her back into it. And it works. Let's go, Nichole. [Liam] Christiana, she's struggling on the Rolling Ascent. [grunts] [Alex] But Nichole doing very well right now. Go, Nichole! [Liam] Christiana almost at the top, but can't get over the last roller. Nichole has a chance to move ahead. [Alex] Oh! Nichole gets rolled! And Christiana is through. Now it's onward to The Cliffs. You got to punch it! Punch it! [Liam] Smash and climb. Create your ladder so you can get yourself up this wall. [grunts] Right now Nichole's using that explosive leg strength to get past the last roller, but Christiana is moving up The Cliffs. [Alex] Nichole needs to get moving! Wow, that preschool teacher has some power. There you go. Use that elbow. Use that elbow. [Liam] Goldenboy, this is where we thought Christiana's eight-inch height advantage would come into play. She doesn't need as many hand and toe holds as Nichole does at five foot even. [Alex] Just look at that reach, Liam. She's at the top. [Liam] She is on to raise the torch, 600 pounds here. [Alex] She just suffered through four intense challenges. Now this crank requires every muscle in your upper body. [crank rattles] There you go, Christiana! Let's go, Nichole. [Alex] Nichole just manages to make her way on top of Mount Olympus. But Christiana fires it up. -[cheering] -[Liam] Here comes Christiana. She's making her descent. [grunts] There are three walls... five feet, six feet, and seven feet. As Nichole continues to try to raise that torch. Go, Mom! Christiana to the third wall, up and over. [laughs] -And throws her hands up? -You're celebrating. [Alex] You know, I hate to break it to you. The struggle starts right now. You have to drag that 200-pound boulder to the tomb and pull out the relic. [dramatic music] Nichole's blasting her biceps on that crank right now. And Nichole Root raises her torch. -Yeah! -Whoo! She still has a chance, but needs to soar down the mountain. Oh, look at this. Christiana draped the chain behind her back to give her that added leverage. Very smart. Very smart strategy. [Liam] Saw a little smile on her face right there. [Alex] She knows she did something clever. And Nichole is making her way down the mountain. [Liam] Nichole's only five feet tall. Look at this. Leaping up and over that last seven foot wall. Let's go, Nichole. [Alex] Liam, this is why you don't celebrate early. Nichole Root is back in the race. Christiana's still moving slowly. [Liam] Nichole still has a shot here, but at 125 pounds, you got to wonder, how is she gonna handle that 200-pound ball and chain? [grunts] [Alex] Oh, Nichole Root is dragging that boulder! -I cannot believe this, Liam! -Oh, my God! [Alex] Christiana was smiling on her way down, hands in the air! Nichole Root said, "To heck with that! "I am going to catch up right here, right now. I want to be a Titan." She's ready to match Christiana blow for blow at the tomb! [dramatic music] [Liam] And look at that! Nichole cracked through first. This is anyone's race. [Alex] Christiana opens the tomb! Nichole's right behind her! Will she be able to mount a comeback? Oh, my goodness! Christiana has the key. -Christiana locks it in. -Done! And Christiana Rugloski is a Titan! [dramatic music] I cannot believe what we just saw. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thanks. {\an7}[Alex] Christiana pulled ahead on the Rolling Ascent, and thought she had an easy lead coming down the mountain. But at the Ball and Chain, the preschool teacher {\an7}gave us a lesson in raw power {\an7}and kept on Christiana's hees all the way to the finish. [Liam] That little girl who was never allowed to play sports as a kid grew up to be a Titan. Derik and Christiana did it. They came. They fought. They conquered. They earned the right to be called Titans. [dramatic music] [Liam] So the lawyer, Derik Scott, and Christiana Rugloski are our newest Titans. Next week, we'll find two more, and in just a few weeks, all 16 will be heading to our Battle of the Titans. We'll see you next week on The Titan Games. [dramatic music]
