 [dramatic music] So much in life comes down to one single moment. You work. You train. You prepare. [Alex] She gets a big hit! When that moment comes, when you get your shot, sometimes it feels like time stands still. [Alex] Oh, my goodness!

 [Alex] Look at the power of Coach Jackie Wood! -We love you. -♪ We are the heroes ♪ ♪ We're talking legends ♪ For some people, it helps to think about everything that led up to this. [James] Becoming the Titan Champion, it shows that second chances do come true, and as long as you stay {\an7}focused, anything can happen. [James] Let's go! ♪ Won't back down until Our hands are to the heavens ♪ ♪ Hero, hero ♪ This is their moment, this is their shot, and how they handle this moment will determine who becomes Titan Champion. When you want to succeed as badly as you want to breathe, that's when you succeed, and that's how bad I want to win. [Alex] Charity Witt has dominated the Herculean Pole! ♪ Heroes We're talking legends ♪ -[Alex] Oh, my word! -♪ Won't back down ♪ ♪ Until our hands Are to the heavens ♪ [Dwayne] It's time to crown some heroes. [Alex] She is a Titan Champion! [wind blowing] [dramatic music] Wow. [laughs] Look at this crowd. Here we go. Welcome to {\an7}The Titan Games Championship. {\an7}I am so proud of what our final {\an7}eight Titans have accomplished. After weeks and weeks of incredible head-to-head competitions, these athletes stand in this very arena undefeated, and they did it with nothing but their own two hands. Tonight, we make history. We crown our first ever Titan Champions. [cheers and applause] So here we go. And I only get to say this once, and I want the world to hear it. I'm not wearing any underwear. Yeah. [cheering] [laughs] I'm only kidding. Or am I? Let the Titan Championship begin. [dramatic music] Thanks, DJ. Here's how tonight will work: We have eight competitors facing off on two different challenges. Then, those four winners will earn the right to race on Mount Olympus. [Alex] In the end, one man and one woman will be crowned the Titan Champion, taking home the trophy and $100,000. So let's throw it down to Cari and get things cracking. Okay, in our first championship battle, {\an7}it's a U.S. airman continuing {\an7}to make his big brother proud, Tyler Lucas, versus the lawyer who has refused to quit in this arena, Derik Scott. After each of Tyler Lucas's Titan Games victories... Whoo, that's my brother! Let's go, Tyler! [Cari] he's gone straight to his best friend -and older brother, Kyle. -I'm proud of you, man. I started getting into sports when my brother started playing. {\an7}He was playing all the sports, {\an7}and my Dad was coaching him, so the bond that they had, I kind of wanted. But they said, you know, I wasn't athletic enough. I wasn't strong, fast enough. Just been doubted a lot, just living in my brother's shadow. [Cari] But when Kyle stopped growing at 5'11", Tyler shot past him to 6'4". Both became elite athletes, playing football at Penn State, and joining the Air Force. And while Kyle was eliminated in the first round of The Titan Games... -I'm proud of you, man. -Hey, I'm proud of you, too. Tyler's now two wins away from the ultimate prize. ♪ Come on Yeah, we're born ready ♪ I'm doing this for all the people that have ever been doubted and told that they can't achieve something. I will become a Titan Champion. ♪ Because we're bringing The fight, come on ♪ [dramatic rock music] [Cari] At 180 pounds, corporate attorney Derik Scott weighs at least 40 pounds less than each of the other three male finalists, but he's not concerned. Obviously, stature-wise, I'm not that big, but it's never intimidated me. It's never limited me. I view it as a challenge. I like beating bigger dudes. I mean, in the first challenge, I got to beat Kwame. Kwame's a big dude, right? [Alex] Derik just has one more. [Liam] And there it goes. [yells] And then I got to battle so hard against Cole, who looks like a Thor, like a Greek hero. [Alex] Look at the power coming out of Cole! [grunts] Derik Scott is pushing him back! A lot of them underestimated me, but I personally do not feel as though I am a dark horse. [Alex] And that is going to do it! Derik Scott is a beast! If you woke up today thinking that you were going to beat me, you should go back to sleep, because I'm going to become the Titan Champion. [Liam] And, Goldenboy, if Derik wants to win here tonight, he'll need to take down another giant. [Alex] Yeah, and it's the biggest one yet. {\an7}Tyler Lucas is seven inches {\an7}taller and 50 pounds heavier. [cheers and applause] [Liam] If Tyler and Derik want another shot at Mount Olympus, they'll have to break down some gates to get there. [Alex] And if you thought it was tough the first time, get ready for an even tougher version of the Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] The Hammering Ram has delivered medieval mayhem all season long. [metal clangs] And tonight, we've cranked up the pain. [Liam] To start, the sledgehammer is now trapped under three metal boxes, each weighing nearly 300 pounds. Then you'll have to hammer not just one, but two steel posts {\an7}to release the 350-pound ram. It's all about heart, grit, and determination, boys. All of our Titans have different reasons for coming here, but they all want the same thing, and that's to be a champion. And now it's within reach. So, Tyler and Derik, I want you to think about your why. Then I want you to obliterate that door. This is Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] [Liam] Derik in the gold. Tyler in the silver. That hammer is buried under those boxes. [Alex] Wow! Those boxes weigh 300 pounds each! Tyler's down first, and there's Derik. They're both ready to start pounding. [grunting] And now, Tyler Lucas, the back of his ram is down. [metal clangs] And Derik's right behind. They're halfway there. [grunts] [Liam] Swinging away like Aaron Judge. [Alex] Derik Scott is struggling with it. [grunting] -Let's go, Tyler! -[Liam] That thing is down already for Tyler as Derik continues to hammer on. [grunts] -[Alex] Now it's gonna drop. -Come on, Derik! Tyler's still in the lead as they get that 350-pound ram moving. It's going to be a battle, Liam! [Liam] Both guys putting everything they have into this. They know if they win, they are headed to Mount Olympus, -they are in the finals. -Let's go! [dramatic music] [Alex] This is the Titan Championship, and DJ wants a front-row seat. Let's go, Derik. [Alex] Derik is 50 pounds lighter than Tyler, so technique is critical. [Liam] And now Derik's finding his rhythm. There you go. Come on! [Alex] It takes as much form as muscle to get that ram swinging. [Liam] Oh, Tyler's getting some big hits. Both athletes using their feet a lot more, moving around, trying to get as much power, force, and range as they can. [Alex] Either side could crack at any second, but look at Derik! He's throwing it! This guy loves to surprise us. Can he pull off another upset? Fight, baby! fight! [Alex] He's managed to make that door just a little bit more loose. Maybe that's the push he needs. [dramatic music] [Liam] He's through. Derik Scott's through! [Alex] He's got the door open! [yells] Oh, my word! [yells] Can you believe it? Derik Scott takes down another giant. That guy's got heart for days. Heart for days. [inaudible] -Thank you for competing. -Yes, sir. -Thank you. -Thanks for that. -Thank you. -Thank you so much. [Alex] Once again, Derik Scott, the underdog, comes out on top. {\an7}[Liam] Maybe we need to stop making this guy the underdog in these events, {\an7}because Derik Scott has locked his spot in the finals, and he's headed back to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] To level up from Titan to Champion, you've got to break through personal and physical barriers. Both of our next competitors have done that and more. From the moment they stepped into the Titan Arena, these two women have been crushing it. [Alex] Oh, my! Look at the swings from Jess Griffith! [grunts] Being on The Titan Games is the opportunity of a lifetime. -Team to ICU, please. -[Cari] Jess Griffith spent five years in the ER as a level-one trauma nurse until she decided that she'd rather help people avoid the hospital in the first place. As a nutrition coach, I am doing what I'm truly passionate about, helping people better themselves. One of the funnest parts about my journey through fitness has been motivating and inspiring my family. My brother gained quite a bit of weight, and I hate to see that, because I love my brother and I want the best for my brother. Your life has just encouraged me to improve my fitness, to take it seriously. I just wanted to say thank you for that. [laughs] [Cari] Tonight Jess pursues her own reward, a spot in the Titan Championship. Uh, Jess is a beast! I know I'm equipped to attack anything that The Rock throws our way, and I'm excited to show the world the hard work that I've put in. It's definitely gonna pay off. Bring home the gold. Let's go. -Love you. -Love you. [Cari] Seven weeks ago, Charity Witt shared her inspiring story of overcoming a heart condition to become a world champion powerlifter and a Titan. Come on, Charity. Wow, let's go! [dramatic music] Just listen to your own heart, and keep fighting. [Cari] But even before her diagnosis at 17, Charity's life was an uphill battle. [soft music] I didn't really have too much of a childhood. My Dad was just out of the picture for about seven years. I assumed that second mom role and took care of my sister at a young age because I felt it was my duty. I left home when I was 15. It just wasn't a good environment for me. I was running away from my problems. ♪ When we fight When we lie ♪ ♪ When the weakness shows ♪ I was allowed to sleep on the couch in the kitchen that I was working at, and I was also a janitor and a kitchen cook. [laughs] ♪ We rise and we fall We hold on ♪ ♪ We hold on ♪ If anything, that taught me, like, you don't quit when you're tired. You just keep going, because you don't have a choice. I would absolutely not be who I am if I hadn't have gone through all of that. -♪ We holding on ♪ -♪ Hold on ♪ -♪ We hold on ♪ -♪ Hold on ♪ ♪ Oh, Lord we hold on together ♪ [cheers and applause] {\an7}[Liam] Charity and Jess are {\an7}two of the most powerful women we've seen all season, so it was only fitting we put them on our most explosive challenge, Uprising. [Alex] They'll be pulling an anvil up five solid levels, but it's tougher this time, because levels two, three, and four are all twice as thick as before. [Liam] Another trip to Mount Olympus is on the line. Take it away, DJ. They're both unbelievable competitors, but only one is moving on to the final Mount Olympus. Charity and Jess, you're going to feel the weight of the world pulling you back, but you got to fight through that, and then ultimately break through. This is Uprising. [dramatic music] [Liam] Jess in the silver. Charity in the gold. Both explode through number one. [Alex] Charity Witt almost ruptured level two! She has so much power! {\an7}But Jess has the edge when it {\an7}comes to cardio and endurance. [both grunt] [Liam] Charity's through the first double. And remember, levels two, three, and four are twice as thick as earlier this season. [laughs] [grunts] Oh, Jess is struggling right now. She's not going back far enough to create the force she needs. [both yell] [Alex] And Charity blasts through the doubles on the third level! Whoo! [Liam] She is crushing it right now! [both grunt] This is so much harder than before. Jess is getting yanked up like a puppet. [grunts] Don't quit! [heavy breathing] [Liam] Charity just about to push through. She can see that victory chain just a few feet away. -It's a 60-foot dash. -Come on, Charity! One more strong push. [Alex] Charity Witt, she's going for it! She's going for it! She's, oh, so close! Oh! She's at the end of her rope! Can she reach? [grunts] -Yes! -Nice. [Alex] Charity has managed to pull victory, and she is going to Mount Olympus for the final battle. Wow. Whoo! -Dude. -I know. [Liam] Jess Griffith, a dominant competitor from day one, but tonight, she met her match. [Alex] With four straight victories, it's clear, there really is no quit in Charity Witt. {\an7}[Liam] And now she's heading to the finals on Mount Olympus. You did great. You crushed it. -Thank you. Thank you. -So proud of you. -I'll see you up there. -Thank you. [dramatic music] Da Vinci had the Mona Lisa. Shakespeare had Hamlet. Beethoven had the Fifth Symphony. And I? I have Mount Olympus. Later tonight, the winners of their challenges will face off here, where we will crown our Titan Champions in what will be a true work of art drenched in glorious blood, sweat, and respect. Let's get to another battle. [cheers and applause] {\an7}[Liam] On the starting line, we have Jackie Wood, a swim coach from San Antonio, Texas. [dramatic music] Jackie is also a serious powerlifter. She's currently ranked the second-strongest lightweight woman in the world. But victories have remained elusive. Even though I've succeeded in Strongwoman, I've always gotten second place. So winning tonight would mean everything. Not winning, there I am, another second-place finish. So I'm... I'm going for gold tonight. I want to be the Titan Champion. [cheers and applause] [Liam] And there's Jackie's Mom, Jeanne. {\an7}[Alex] She's definitely been the most vocal supporter we've had inside of the Titan Arena. [Liam] Well, tonight, her daughter will be facing the youngest and most surprising Titan left in the competition, 21-year-old Christiana Rugloski. Christiana was raised in a conservative family and didn't even start playing competitive sports until three years ago. She surprised everyone, including herself, by reaching the Titan Championship. I think my biggest strength is my mental attitude. I don't fear failure. I don't fear getting hurt. I don't have anything that's stopping me from pushing myself to the max. And I'm so ready to get out there again. [Liam] Goldenboy, here we are again, Hammering Ram. Expect the unexpected. DJ. Expect the unexpected is right. It all comes down to this moment. Christiana, you have been called an underdog. {\an7}Time and time again, you've {\an7}made them eat their words. Jackie, despite the fact that at times, you've doubted yourself, you have steamrolled your path to get here. Now you're both facing one of the most physically demanding challenges we have, and I've made it even harder. Nothing left to do but blow the doors off this entire place. This is Hammering Ram. [dramatic music] [Liam] Jackie in the gold. Christiana in the silver. First step, tossing away those heavy metal boxes to get to those hammers. [grunts] Both going to work on that back post first. [grunts] [Alex] Coach Jackie, she is hacking at that like she's Thor! [metal clangs] And Christiana's halfway there. [grunts] {\an7}[Liam] Big swings from Jackie. She's almost got the ram all the way down. [grunts] Christiana choking up on the hammer. She doesn't have Jackie's raw power. Yes! Yeah! [Alex] Now it's time for Jackie to get that ram rocking. Christiana so close, though, from releasing it. She manages to do so. Maybe she can catch up to Coach Jackie. [Liam] And Jackie already has her technique down. The idea of running it back and forth, not just using your upper body. [Alex] Christiana, she's struggling to be able to get control of the ram! That ram's 350 pounds, and right now, it's pulling her. [Liam] Coach Jackie has this down. [grunts] [Alex] Coach Jackie, she's got the door loose, Liam! Yeah, do it, Jackie! And look at this! The horse trainer's using brains instead of brute force! She's falling back and using all her weight to follow through. Come on, Chris! [Liam] And it's working. Both women are slamming those gates. -Go, go! -Come on! [both grunting] [Alex] And a big hit from Christiana! But Jackie Wood, she cracked it! [screams] And the door's open! The door is open! Coach Jackie has grabbed the victory chain, and victory is hers! [dramatic music] There you go. Way to go, Jacks! [Liam] Just one more victory away from her Titan dreams. That's how you do it! And what a great emotional scene there with her father, her mother, her brother in the audience. I'm so proud of you. {\an7}[Alex] And Christiana with that smile, even in defeat. [Liam] But her Cinderella story ends here tonight. -Give me a hug. -Awesome. Oh, my God. [Alex] And Jackie Wood, who entered this competition grappling with doubt, is now one of the final two women left tonight. [Liam] And she's standing by with Cari. Jackie, your Mom is here tonight. Talk to me about what she means to you right now. My Mom is my everything. She's my best friend. She's my rock. Um... [chuckles] -I love you. -Every time that I'm down, she's there to pick me up, and I would not be where I am today without her. Absolutely not. You are headed to our final Mount Olympus. -How's that sound? -Hell, yeah. [laughter] -Let's do it. -Congratulations, Jackie. Thank you so much. Thank you. [Liam] So our first Mount Olympus match is set. Swim coach Jackie Wood will face powerlifter Charity Witt with the championship on the line. [Alex] Their race is coming up. [dramatic music] [Liam] Welcome back to the Titan Championship. It's time for round two of Uprising. Explosive power is a must. [Alex] And we have the perfect two guys about to strap in. [Liam] Take it away, Cari. In this battle, the soft-spoken college kid who's made a loud statement in this arena, Bridger Buckley, is here, and he's taking on the Miami truck driver who's backed up his bold statements with victories, James Jean-Louis. [grunting] Each of James Jean-Louis's victories in the Titan Arena have been punctuated by a hug from the two men that drive him, his son Semaj and his Dad Jean. To have my father and my son there to cheer me on, -it means a lot. -Oh, my God, hallelujah! My father being a pastor, he was very stern and very strict. My family, you know, being first-generation Haitian, only thing that we were able to do was go to home, school, and church. We called it three Ls... lekol, lakay, legliz. While all my brothers and sisters, you know, they followed the rules, I was the only one that kind of rebelled. And when I was facing jail time, I did let my parents down. I let them down completely. [dramatic music] But delivering beer was the beginning of my second chance for me to change my life around and, you know, helping providing for my son as well. You were a hotheaded kid, but there was hope. You turned around. That's what matters. ♪ You gonna know my name now ♪ ♪ You gonna know my name now ♪ Growing up, my role model was my father. And now I want my son to actually learn from me and look at me as his hero. I just want to be a positive role model for him. {\an7}♪ You gonna know my name now ♪ [dramatic music] [Cari] Bridger Buckley's performances in the Titan Arena have revealed a rare combination of size, strength, and speed. [Alex] Bridger Buckley is your next Titan! [Cari] The Titan Games have been the world's first glimpse at this 22-year-old's remarkable talent, because his college football career was derailed before it started. [soft music] Three years ago, I was riding my bike home, and a car cut in front of me last-minute. Flew over, and... [sirens wail] don't remember the rest of the night. I split my head open, fractured some vertebrae. After the accident, I was just super depressed. I've had injuries before, but not injuries that were this intense. So it took me a while to stop feeling sorry for myself. I started fighting back and pushing my body again. It just felt good to be able to move. [Cari] Finally back at full strength, Bridger's taking aim at the Titan Championship. I'm a Titan now, and I will become the Titan Champion. ♪ They're storming out On a wire ♪ This is going to be awesome. [Liam] Two dynamic competitors. The winner takes on Derik Scott in the final on Mount Olympus. DJ. Bridger, James, you're both shining examples of what it means to be a Titan. Now show the world why you deserve to be a Champion. Let's get to work. This is Uprising. [dramatic music] [Liam] They're off and running! [concrete crumbles] [Alex] Oh, my word! These are double layers, people! James is going all the way back to build momentum. Bridger, only halfway. [grunts] James Jean-Louis has gone through the third like a hot knife through butter! [Liam] And remember, levels two, three, and four are all twice as thick as earlier this season. -Go, Bridge, go! -Go! Go! [dramatic music] [Liam] Seeing different techniques here. Bridger's not going back very far. James is using as much runway as possible. [Alex] But they both only have two levels to go. It's neck and neck! -Here comes James Jean-Louis! -[James] Come on! Come on! He's got it! And James Jean-Louis, the Miami trucker, is moving to the finals! [yells] Come on! Come on! {\an7}Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Whoo! [Liam] So James Jean-Louis seizes the last spot on Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] All season long, our competitors have had to battle it out on Mount Olympus to earn the title of Titan. On this mighty mountain, we've seen feats of strength... -[Alex] Look at the power! -incredible athleticism... [Alex] Oh, my goodness! What was that? -cries of pain... -Ohh! -and tears of joy. -[Alex] I can't believe it! -What a race! -Whoever conquers this beast tonight become the first ever Titan Champions. [cheers and applause] [Alex] And if these athletes thought Mount Olympus was tough last time, we've got some bad news. [Liam] The 1,000-pound wall is now the 1,200-pound wall. [Alex] And now, when you reach the bottom, you need to pull furiously on the Vortex chains to raise the 500-pound cage that's blocking access to the Ball and Chain. [dramatic music] [Liam] Now Charity Witt and Jackie Wood are gonna get the first shot. And so many of our other Titans are in the stands. [Alex] Nobody wants to miss this match, Liam. [Liam] Well, let's not keep them waiting. DJ. These two forces of nature have come so far to get here. Jackie, with your family cheering you on, you managed to find the inner strength {\an7}even you didn't know you had. It has personally been such a pleasure watching you compete and succeed. Charity, I am blown away {\an7}by your power and your resolve. {\an7}You've gone from being homeless to breaking world records. You didn't let a heart condition {\an7}or any Titan opponent stop you {\an7}from achieving your dreams. And now the moment is here. Jackie, Charity, all I want, all everyone in this arena wants, is all you got. [dramatic music] This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Jackie on the left. Charity on the right. And it starts with that 1,200-pound wall. {\an7}[Alex] These are two of the {\an7}strongest women in the world. Charity Witt manages to throw down the wall. Jackie Wood now manages to do the same. And now it's on to the Gates of Olympus. [Liam] Jackie already has some ground to make up. [grunts] We figured Charity would be excellent at these first two challenges. This is where things can get tricky, Rolling Ascent. [Alex] This next obstacle could make or break your run. [grunts] You don't want to rush and make a mistake. Jackie Wood, though, she needs to gain. -Oh, and a stumble. -Agh! Come on, Jackie! [Alex] Charity Witt on to The Cliffs. [both grunting] [Liam] But Coach Jackie's back on her feet and making up ground coming up to The Cliffs. Go, Jackie! Go! [grunts] [Liam] This thing's just about even. Jackie's come back here on The Cliffs. Both women taking their time, making sure they don't slip. Remember, we've seen some bad falls here. [Alex] These are two women who have decimated their competition here at The Titan Games. -[grunts] -Oh, Jackie slips! Any little mistake will cost you precious seconds. [grunts] [Liam] Charity keeps her lead and is at the top of Mount Olympus. Whoo! Come on, Charity! [grunts] [Alex] Charity Witt is now starting to raise the torch. [Liam] 600 pounds, 25 feet tall. There's Jackie. She's up top, and she needs to make up ground. [Alex] Remember, Jackie can dead lift 350 pounds. Don't expect this crank to slow her down. Go, Jackie, go! Let's go! [grunts] Charity Witt has just managed to raise the torch! Go down Mount Olympus as fast as humanly possible, because you know that Jackie Wood is going to fly down that mountain and catch up the moment that that torch is raised. [grunts] And there she is! Jackie's hot on her heels. [dramatic music] The championship is on the line. Charity has come so far. But Jackie Wood is halfway down the mountain as well and so close to catching up, but this is where Charity needs to shine, here on our newest obstacle on Mount Olympus. [grunts] Jackie Wood now gets down Mount Olympus. Let's go, Jackie! They have to pull the chains, raise that 500-pound cage six feet, and then the gates drop. That is when they can move and grab the ball and chain. And don't forget, the first challenge Jackie ever won on Titan Games was the Vortex using this exact motion. [Liam] And Jackie Wood is starting to gain, but Charity's cage is almost up. [Alex] Charity has opened the gates! And now it is time to drag the ball and chain to the Titan tomb. Whoo! Come on! [grunts] Charity just has no grip on the ball. [grunts] And Jackie Wood, the coach, caught up. This is a dead heat! They can both taste that title. Go, Jackie! [Liam] One more wrinkle. It was 200 pounds. For this one, we step it up. It's 300 pounds. Come on! [grunts] Here comes Charity! [Alex] Charity Witt says, "I'm just going to drag "this son of a gun to the Titan tomb. I'm going to end this right now." Jackie Wood, she's stuck. She's stuck on the ball. She needs to start moving this thing. [grunts] Don't stop! [Alex] Jackie Wood is digging deep. What looked like an impossible task before, she's managed to drag it halfway. [both grunting] That ball and chain weighs twice what Jackie does, and she's fighting it right now. Jackie gets it moving. Does she have anything left? [exhales] Go, go, go, go, go! Charity Witt, she's going at the tomb, but she hasn't made much progress, Liam. Jackie's at the tomb. It all rides on this. Charity's already digging for the relic. Has she broken the cement enough? That's the question. She has the relic! She has the relic in her hand! She needs to tug it out! But it's stuck. Jackie still has a shot. [grunts] [Liam] Right now, Goldenboy, I'm wondering, did Charity jump the gun? Did she crack enough away? Come on. You got to dig deep. [grunts] Come on, Jackie! Just go now! [dramatic music] [Alex] She's got it in her hands! Charity Witt! They told her her heart wasn't strong enough, so she made it stronger! Ladies and gentleman, she is a Titan Champion! Oh, my God. [Liam] Nine years ago, she didn't have a place to live. She has made her home right here in Titan Arena. She takes home the first Titan Trophy and $100,000. -Oh, my God. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -I'm so proud of you. Thank you. [Alex] Such a tough night for Jackie Wood. Second place, but still a first-class effort. You did it! You did it! Oh, my God! You did it! [sobs] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I love you. We're so proud of you. It's okay. It's okay. [Liam] And right now, Charity Witt is standing by with Cari. You had your sister in the audience, and you came here with something to prove. Tell me what that meant for you. You know, we come from a very long line of strong women. We know what hard times look like. So, I was, like, "You know what? "I've been to Hell once. I can go back and come out again." [exhales] From homeless to Titan Champion, my friend. You deserve the crown that is waiting for you. -Go see DJ. -Thank you. Whoo! All right, ah! Charity, you exemplify what being a Titan is all about. You have inspired millions of people around the world. You are a legend. Congratulations. [cheers and applause] -Whoo! -Whoo! Charity is our female Champion. We'll crown our male Titan Champion coming up next. Legend. [dramatic music] Our final male competitors are about to face off. These two Titans are here not because they dreamed of being here, but because they relentlessly pursued that dream. James, second chances and fatherhood, those are your anchors and what ignites your power and your passion. {\an7}Derik, you're all about drive, my friend. {\an7}It infuses everything you do, {\an7}facing every obstacle head-on and never, ever giving up. Time to make history. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] James on the left. Derik on the right. And a 1,200-pound wall to start things off. [Alex] Both throw them down at the same time, and charge into the Gates. [grunts] [grunts] [Liam] Three Gates of Olympus, a blistering pace. Rolling Ascent's next. [Alex] This is where things can get dicey, but James, hopping up with no hands! -Yeah! -Yeah! But Derik is right behind him. Let's go, boys. [Liam] And now they're into The Cliffs. 12 feet high, create your own ladder. Smash, and get on top. [Alex] Derik's putting his MMA skills to work. [dramatic music] But James Jean-Louis makes it to the top of Mount Olympus first. But again, he just can't shake Derik Scott. -Come on, D! -[Liam] But here at the crank, James's raw power comes into play. It's time to turn and burn as you crank the torch and raise it and try to light it. [Alex] 600 pounds, and look at this! Derik Scott, oh, my! What just happened? The lawyer just took the lead. -Come on, D! -Derik, get down here. [grunts] [Liam] And James has to get moving. Three walls in front of him... five feet, six feet, and seven feet. [Alex] Derik Scott is doing somersaults over those walls! And here comes James! The Bud man wants his lead back. Derik Scott, though, looking to take down another giant. Having a lead will be critical as he heads into these final power obstacles. [Liam] This is where things change, a quarter-ton cage. You need upper-body strength. You got to put everything in it. [Alex] James Jean-Louis has that upper body advantage. He has 40 pounds over Derik, and look at his game face right now. [grunts] Let's go! [Alex] Derik Scott needs to hurry up, because James Jean-Louis is right there. It's down! James is back in front. Whoo! [Liam] But we've learned not to sleep on Derik Scott. He always finds a way to surprise us. [Alex] And the truck driver is backing it up. [Liam] Ball and chain was 250 pounds. Now it is 350 pounds. [Alex] Derik is running out of time. James is ready to drop the hammer. [Liam] Can this lawyer summon one last miracle? Go, Derik! [dramatic music] Let's go, James! Come on! [Alex] James Jean-Louis, he's managed to hack through the Titan tomb! He's right there, Liam! [grunts] He's got it! James Jean-Louis, the Haitian Sensation, is your Titan Champion! [dramatic music] -Congratulations, brother. -Thank you. -So proud of you. -Thank you. Your family and especially your son, -are so proud of you, too. -Thank you. Whoo! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Whoo! That's how we do it! [laughs] [sniffs] [Liam] What a story. A few weeks ago, this guy's driving a truck for Budweiser, and now he's taking home $100,000, and Dwayne Johnson is declaring him the Titan Champion. -I love you. -I love you, guys. -Hey, oh! -I love you, my son. -I love you, too. -This was for you. {\an7}This was for you. I told you. Thank you for competing, brother. -Thank you, sir. -I'm very proud of you. Thank you so much for competing. -Yes, sir. -Thank you. [Alex] And Derik Scott can stand tall. He had the lead coming down the mountain and pushed James every step of the way. [Liam] But James Jean-Louis was unstoppable, and he's standing by with Cari. From truck driver to Titan Champion. My friend, congratulations. It was amazing. It feels amazing. I mean, obviously you guys can see Derik made me work hard. But honestly, I was just a bit more hungry. My motivation's right here. You know, 11 years. You know, I'm here today. This is my second chance. Head up to DJ. He makes it official. Hey! Whoo! [dramatic music] -Oh, yeah. -So, James... -Oh, yeah. -I got to tell you, brother. Uh, you exemplify what a Titan is. This is my stage, but this is your house. -Thank you. -You are a legend, and you are a Titan. Congratulations, brother. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Come here, man! Yeah! Yeah! You want to shake his hand and say hi, man? Good job. [laughter] You look like me when I was a kid. Whoo! This has been a truly unforgettable experience. Thank you for being part of such an epic journey. I had a blast, and remember. Blood, sweat, and respect. The first two, you give. The last one, you earn. Good night from The Titan Games. Yes.
