 Those that emerge victorious will advance to Mount Olympus. I have been trained to perform under immense pressure. [Alex] I can't believe it! Once I step out into that arena, I become fierce. [grunts] -Wow. [Dwayne] Where tonight, we'll crown one man and one woman as Titans. -I didn't come here from Afghanistan to lose this thing. I will be a Titan. ♪ It's about to get crazy ♪ -Yeah. -♪ It's about to go down ♪ Let's get crazy. This is The Titan Games. -Yeah! -♪ It's about to go down ♪ [dramatic music] [Alex] Please welcome Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson! Let's get this show on the road. Welcome to Titan Arena. Tonight, eight more powerful competitors have arrived from all over the country to put their abilities to the test. Among the people I've chosen are a chef, a special education teacher, a veteran New York City firefighter, and a Purple Heart recipient. And I can't wait for you to meet them and watch them lay it all out on the line. And helping me out in Titan Arena, my friend, Cari Champion. [cheers and applause] -Let's go, DJ! -Welcome. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you. This crowd is ready. -They're ready. -Now, it's time to hear the words that I love to say. Kevin Hart, shut your mouth and make me a sandwich. I love saying that. [laughs] But the words that I also love to say. Let the Titan Games begin! [dramatic music] Okay, in our first battle, it's the Purple Heart combat vet who's proved he can take on anything versus {\an7}the martial arts-loving chef. That's right, a chef, who's revamped his lifestyle to get healthy. [dramatic music] Becoming a Titan doesn't only require intense training. It also demands a proper diet. Josh works as a chef at Boston Celtics and Bruins games and is constantly surrounded by comfort food. The games are very late, so you just forget about yourself. I would eat the hot dog with Froot Loops on it. -♪ Goodness gracious ♪ -Loaded nachos. -♪ It's amazing ♪ -I would grab chicken fingers and eat over a trash can, you know? I gained a lot of weight, and I stopped working out. I looked at my kids, and I realized that I needed to drive myself toward nutrition. [Cari] Josh started waking every day at 4 a.m., running three and a half miles to the gym, training to the point of exhaustion, then running three and a half miles back home. And I lost 30 pounds, and I continued to push myself, and I lost 30 more. -Three, what's next? -Four. Four? Oh, boy, four. [Josh] The dad bod was officially gone, and the next thing I know, I was featured in Men's Health magazine. [Cari] Stepping into our arena tonight, Josh will finally get to show what his new body is made of. I spent all this time building the body of a Titan, and now I want to put it to the test. ♪ Yeah, it's so incredible♪ [dramatic music] [Cari] For Christopher Watts, being fit isn't just a lifestyle choice. It's a matter of life and death. [radio crackles] This US Army veteran works security for top-secret clients in the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan. I can't say too much about my job, but I provide people with safe travels to certain meetings. ♪ Crawl through The undergrowth ♪ ♪ Cat gone cray ♪ ♪ Fighting like a warrior Seize the day ♪ [Cari] Watts forged his body into a lethal weapon while serving in Iraq, but a single tragic moment forced him to become mentally tough as well. In 2009, my unit did award me with a Purple Heart. We went to Iraq. They brought in this fantastic guy, Sergeant First Class, uh, James Doster. I was lucky enough to drive him, and, uh... [exhales] You know, the big roadside bomb went off, and, uh, once the dust and everything settled, we had lost him. He's the reason why I'm here, so hopefully, I can, uh... do him proud in this... this competition. [dramatic music] I'm going to, you know, put my heart out there and try my best to win the title of Titan tonight. I didn't come here from Afghanistan to lose this thing. [cheers and applause] [Liam] For Chris, this is more than a chance to honor his fallen comrade. It's also a family reunion. -Whoo! -Chris hasn't seen his Mom in the nearly two years {\an7}he's been stationed overseas. [Liam] And his military training is about to get put to the test. Put the treadmill on the most extreme angle and set the speed to absolute pain. They're marching to Heavy Metal. [dramatic music] [Liam] DJ engineered a challenge that requires your glutes, hamstrings, quads, and willpower to all be in sync as you lug 350 pounds of chain -30 feet uphill. -[Alex] With every step, the chain uncoils from the ground, making the load heavier the higher you go. At the top, you must use your upper body to turn a crank and lift the remaining chain, plus a 100-pound concrete block three stories high. [Liam] Complete this insanity first, and you're headed to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] Here's the thing. I know these guys, and they have a hunger that can only be filled by winning this competition. Christopher and Josh, become what you were meant to be. This is Heavy Metal. [dramatic music] [Liam] So it's Josh the chef in blue, and the combat vet, Chris, in the red. Only way to Mount Olympus, you have to get to the top of Heavy Metal. Josh, he had that sprint right out of the bat, but now the resistance is there, the weight. [grunting] [Alex] Yeah, and you're also starting to see that balance come into play as well. Every foot of chain you lift off the ground adds ten pounds of weight on your back. Whoo! Go, Josh! [grunting] You start with a microwave, and by the top, you're carrying a refrigerator. Both guys are about halfway up. Stay strong, Chris! Whoo! Look at those quads! There we go. There you go. [Liam] Josh seems to find a steady balance here, and Josh is at the top. [Alex] The guy who used to eat Froot Loops for dinner is leading an elite combat warrior! But it doesn't stop there. You got to crank. You got to use a lot of upper-body strength. You have to bring that concrete block up 15 feet. And look at that motion. It's a chest press down on the bar then a lat pull back up. [both grunting] [dramatic music] [Liam] When they start this thing, 100 pounds. Yeah! At the top, 400 pounds. And look at this. Chris the combat vet is getting creative. He's using his body weight to drive that crank down. [Alex] Josh got the jump going up the ramp. Now, as we've gotten to the crank, Chris has the lead! His block is off the ground! Go, Chris! Whoo! [grunting] [Liam] He's using the downward momentum to go right into the upswing. But now Josh's block is rising. [grunting] [Alex] Chef Josh is moving that block, but he's gotta hustle. Chris Watts is almost there. He might do it! [grunting] Yes, Chris Watts is your winner, and he is going to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] An American hero making moments to remember here at The Titan Games. [Alex] He traveled 9,000 miles to get here, and his journey's not over yet. [Liam] Chris conquered one of our toughest challenges so far, and now, he's standing by with Cari. Congratulations, Chris. I know you're all the way here from Afghanistan. What does it mean to have your Mom here in the crowd for you tonight? Oh, it means the world. She's my biggest support. Where is she at? Hold on. Sorry. Sorry. -I love you, Mom. -Whoo! [laughs] [Liam] Chris is moving on to Mount Olympus for a chance to become a Titan and continue on in this competition. [dramatic music] Oh, I love you. Congratulations. -Oh, he love his Mama! -Yeah, I do. [dramatic music] What's up, guys? {\an7}Look at this crowd over here. Yes, yes! How you doing? [screams] Hi, how you doing? How are you? What's up? How you doing? Good to meet you. [all scream] How are you? [dramatic music] I designed this competition to be a reflection of myself and the competitors in these games. You got to be tough, you got to be relentless, and you also have to be a little crazy. The competitions are not easy, because nothing in this world worth having ever comes easy. And I don't want people just to watch The Titan Games. I want them to be inspired and hopefully go out and feel like they can conquer the world. Because in the end, it's us crazy ones that dent the universe. Let's get to our next battle. {\an7}[Liam] On the starting line {\an7}right now we have Ashley Huhn. {\an7}This special education teacher from Denver {\an7}was a soccer star in college, but never let her passion for sports die. Ashley teaches her students to never settle. It's a motto she actually has tattooed onto her hip. {\an7}And Ashley will be facing off with Jasmin Guinn, a graphics animator who helps care for her grandmother back in San Francisco who suffers from Alzheimer's. [Alex] Jasmin was also a serious athlete in college until a devastating injury ended her career. When she heard Dwayne's call to action for The Titan Games, it inspired her to start training again and get back into shape. She's here tonight to prove to herself that she is still an elite athlete. Jasmin and Ashley are about to wage war on a challenge so taxing, we named it after the son of Zeus. [Alex] They'll have to push themselves to the limit on the Herculean Pull. [dramatic music] DJ wanted to create a challenge where you outleverage an opponent you can't even see. {\an7}[Liam] First, you use grip {\an7}strength and upper-body power to unthread two 100-pound silver poles, each longer than a pickup truck. [Alex] Next is a blind tug of war with the golden pole, and you can't use the ground for help. [Liam] Whoever can hang on and generate the most force will hit the target and punch their ticket to Mount Olympus. [cheers and applause] What I love about this challenge is that you're battling it out with an opponent that you can't see. And you know what? That's the way it is in real life, too. Sometimes you're fighting blind. But no matter what the circumstance, you need to seize the opportunity, and when you think you've given your max, push past that, And on the other side of that, greatness awaits. Ashley, Jasmin, time to show the world what you're made of. This is Herculean Pull. [dramatic music] [Liam] Jasmin in the red. Ashley in the blue. Alex, they're on the same pole! [Alex] They could have gone for any of the four poles, and they went for the same one! The question is, do you want to fight? Do you want to exert energy on this pole, or do you want to move on to the next one? [grunting] [grunting] [Alex] Jasmin lets go. The graphic artist has to make up ground. Come on, Jas. Come on. [grunts] On the other side, Ashley, she is pulling away at it! [Liam] Smart move there by Jasmin. She knew she was losing that one. She moved on to the next. Ashley has one pole left. Jasmin's right behind. [Alex] But now I'm wondering, are they both going to go for the same pole again? And they do! But Jasmin says, "No way. I'm not going to make that same mistake this time." [dramatic music] And look at that. Jasmin's done! And now she's ahead and going for the golden pole! [Liam] She's there, and she lost her footing. -Wow! -[Alex] I can't believe it! [both grunting] That could have cost her the game. Ashley is right back into this one. [both grunting] [Liam] You saw Ashley earlier. This teacher definitely has the advantage when it comes to strength. [dramatic music] This is where technique comes into play. You have to hold your body perpendicular to the pyramid, use your legs for leverage, arms to pull, and core to keep your body aloft. [both grunting] Got to dig. You got to dig. [Alex] Jasmin has a little bit of give here. She could reposition herself, maybe angle herself a little bit better. [Liam] The Titan Games inspired her to get back in shape after her injury, and right now she is proving she belongs in this arena. [grunting] [Alex] Look at Ashley! She's wedged in using one leg to balance so the other can press. She can dead lift 315 pounds, and all of her students can see how tough their teacher is right now. [Liam] Jasmin getting closer to that steel plate. Just a few more feet! [Alex] Oh, no! Jasmin's so close from locking this one in! The steel plate is right behind her! Just... Just inches, inches before it kicks the plate. Ashley needs to dig deep. [dramatic music] [Liam] Ashley, our teacher, clinging to hope. [grunting] Jasmin wins it! -Good job, Jas! -There you go! Good job! The artist, the athlete, and now, hoping to add the title of Titan. [Alex] What a match. Jasmin made a critical decision early. Instead of fighting for control of the first silver pole, she gave it to Ashley {\an7}and used her elite athleticism to make up ground. {\an7}The animator turned dominator. [dramatic music] -I thought it got stuck. -I think my hands... I can't open my hands right now. [Alex] Jasmin moves on to Mount Olympus for a shot to become a Titan and come back in a few weeks to compete in our Battle of the Titans. [dramatic music] [Liam] Welcome back to The Titan Games. While we were away, Jess Griffith, a nutritionist and registered nurse who is so dedicated to healthy living that she spends 30 hours a week in the gym {\an7}faced off against Erin Lavoie {\an7}from Spokane, Washington. Erin competes in lumberjack games, and is a three-time world champ for her skills with an ax. Erin and Jess took their shot on Heavy Metal. [dramatic music] Right away, you could see the strength needed to ascend the 30-foot ramp. Every foot adds ten pounds to their load. [Alex] At the bottom, it's 100 pounds, -by the top, 350. -Let's go, Jess. [Liam] Then Erin the ax woman proved her legs were strong as oak, powering her way to the crank first. [Alex] Erin's already on top! [Liam] When the trauma nurse reached the top, Jess found another gear and shifted into overdrive. [grunting] [Alex] Oh, my! Look at this! Uh, Jess is kicking ass. And there you have it! Jess is your winner! Yeah. [cheers and applause] [Liam] So that means later tonight, Jess Griffith will compete against Jasmin Guinn {\an7}on Mount Olympus for a chance to become a Titan. [dramatic music] Now I know why my buddy, Chris Hemsworth, likes putting on that Thor costume. I mean, there's real power {\an7}in wielding a hammer like this. I got an idea, guys. How about we make a Thor and Fast and Furious movie? You guys want to do that? With the God of Thunder, Thor himself. He comes flying in, you know, and then, wham! He gets stopped by the real God of Thunder, yeah. Box office gold. #ThorHitsTheFloor. You're welcome, Chris. He's going to text me later. {\an7}-Time for our next challenge. -Thanks, DJ. It's a heavyweight battle between two competitors who go above and beyond the call of duty. Check this out. One's a 245-pound New York City firefighter, while the other is a 6'7" Ivy Leaguer who is going beyond his parents's American dream. [dramatic music] The Okoyes moved from Nigeria to America 30 years ago for a better life. Now, to make his parents proud, this Cornell graduate and financial analyst goes by two names. His middle name, Nnamdi, represents his soft-spoken business side. I'm a super nerd. I'm watching anime on the weekends, and I'm reading about space and science, like, in my free time. While his first name, Maximus, {\an7}speaks to his massive frame... ♪ Freight train Wrecking ball ♪ ♪ I'm the gladiator ♪ and his larger-than-life gym personality. When I am working out, I'm probably the loudest person in the room. [grunting] [metal clatters] [grunts] When I get going, it's like a locomotive. Whoever is around me, I really don't see you. I'm just trying to go through you. ♪ Gladiator, gladiator ♪ I worked all my life to be the best at everything I do, and tonight, I will be a Titan. [soft music] [Cari] The Titan Games is a platform to turn everyday people into heroes, but some of our competitors really are heroes every day. [dramatic music] [alarm bell rings] I've been a New York City firefighter for 15 years. It's the greatest job in the world. [truck horn blaring] You could be running into a burning building. You could be going into a water rescue run. You could be driving to the West Side Highway, and there's a plane in the middle of the Hudson. Every day, you never know what you're going to face. "Llama, llama, busy day." I have twins, Madison and Anthony. They're seven years old. They're the love of my life. Perfect braid, what do you think? I'm really excited my kids get to watch me compete. [grunts] All their classmates will be able to see me. You know, "My Daddy's on TV tonight on NBC with The Rock." New York's bravest, baby. Yeah! I love being a fireman, but, like, I want to do something that's, like, off the charts, or something that's, like, out of the ordinary. I'm the biggest, strongest, fastest guy in this competition. I'm going to smash all of them. [cheers and applause] [Alex] Oh, boy. Here we go. It's the tallest competitor against the widest? [dramatic music] [Liam] Welcome back to The Titan Games, where two colossal competitors are about to face off. [Alex] {\an7}It's New York City firefighter Frank "The Tank" Sansonetti versus 6'7" business analyst Maximus Okoye. [Liam] Take it away, DJ. This is what The Titan Games is all about. These competitions need to have it all... jaw-dropping visuals, intense physicality, and of course, pure fun. We want to redefine what an athletic competition can be, and Frank, Maximus, nothing embodies that more than what you're about to experience. [dramatic music] [Alex] Using a 10-pound hammer, you must smash two giant 350-pound stones. [Liam] Cracking through the concrete will require the hammer to be moving at an angular velocity of more than 400 degrees per second. [Alex] Then, when you think they're light enough, {\an7}you'll try to raise the stones 25 feet in the air. [Liam] The first to complete this insane arm-and back-shredding challenge {\an7}gets through to Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] This is Atlas Smash. [dramatic music] [Liam] Massive Maximus and Frank the Tank. -Frank the Tank slips. -Oh! [Dwayne] Wow! [Liam] Had to go find that Atlas hammer, and Maximus has an edge. Look at this again. {\an7}Frank falls so hard, he sends his Titan hammer flying. [Alex] He needs to make up time. Oh, and there he goes. Oh, my goodness. Look at that Frank. He starts swinging away, and you see just big chunks from that Atlas stone beginning to come off. [grunting] [Liam] You just know, as a firefighter, Frank is a pro with an ax. [Alex] And Maximus, too. They're pulverizing those stones, Liam! [grunts] Frank's already going for the rope? That must still be too heavy to lift. [Liam] Maximus, meanwhile, chipping away. [Alex] This is a gamble. [Liam] Yeah, that stone still must weigh nearly 300 pounds. But look at this! That stone's rising! [dramatic music] Frank is a strong son of a... [grunts] [laughs] Wow! [Alex] Maximus the analyst, well, he's seen enough. He's gonna go for the rope. Frank's first stone is almost up. There it is! Now it's on to the next one. Come on, baby! Go, Frank! [Alex] Now, it's going to be Maximus's turn to bring the Atlas stone up, and he knows that the pressure is on. [Liam] And he can see Frank the Tank working on his second stone. [grunts] Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! [Alex] Maximus nearly has his stone up. [dramatic music] There it is! [Liam] But Maximus has got some serious ground to make up. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Oh, and he looks spent right now. On the other side, though, you now have Frank, {\an7}who's managed to take away a {\an7}good chunk of that Atlas stone. {\an7}And he's headed for the rope. {\an7}[Alex] This isn't just power. Cardio is critical here. Maximus is starting to rally! Frank, on the other hand, is the firefighter running out of gas? You can see he's struggling to raise that second stone. The lactic acid buildup in Frank's body right now is beyond measure. [Liam] You got to wonder if you're Frank right now. you're giving it everything you have, the stone's not moving. Is it time to bring it down and chip away some more? [Alex] This is time that he is wasting here. You have to have the strategy. [Liam] Here it comes. Here it comes back down, and back up with the hammer. Frank moving in, trying to knock more off. Smart move on Frank's part. [dramatic music] [Liam] Maximus is in a world of pain right now. This is nothing like staring at spreadsheets all day. [Alex] And Frank keeps on slugging. He's going to show his kids that he can crack it like a walnut. Come on, baby! Go! And look at Maximus, pushing through the pain. He may have to try lifting soon to catch up with Frank. [Liam] And there goes Frank. [Alex] New York's Bravest, and maybe New York's Titan. [grunts] And you see it. He's feeling it now! He's feeling it now! [dramatic music] Come on, Frank, go! You're almost there! He's so close! Just one more pull. And there it is! He did it! Frank is your winner! Madison, Anthony, I love you! New York, baby! Whoo! Making the New York City Fire Department and all firefighters very proud. Frank "The Tank" Sansonetti is moving on to Mount Olympus. [groans] [Alex] He's going to go now over to his girlfriend, Bharda. [Liam] I can't believe he's got the strength and the energy to go over that wall. Good job, baby. I love you. I love you, too. [Alex] Frank got off to a rough start, hitting the floor before he even touched the hammer. But watch Sansonetti slap off half the stone with a single blow! Wow! [Liam] Madison and Anthony, your Daddy's headed to Mount Olympus. -Congratulations. -Thank you. All right, that's a hard thing to do right there. -Oh, my God. -It's hard. Thank for the opportunity. I appreciate it. -Absolutely. -Thank you. -I'm very proud of you. -Thank you. -I gave it the best I could, man. -Congratulations, man. -I appreciate it. I'm very proud of you. [dramatic music] Four competitors have already tasted victory tonight, but as I've said from the start, winning is only the beginning. Now these winners will have to battle each other in order to become Titans. [dramatic music] Mount Olympus is the crown jewel in the Titan Arena. From the strength required to push over a half-ton wall and drive 450 pounds up a 25-degree incline, to the agility to climb over six spinning cylinders, each wider than a redwood tree, {\an7}each stage of Mount Olympus {\an7}has been specifically designed to test all aspects of athleticism. If you have a weakness, the mountain's gonna reveal it. Prove that you can conquer my mountain, and you join my Team of Titans. [cheers and applause] Now, two powerful athletes are returning to the Titan Arena after taking down worthy opponents. It's one of New York's finest, Frank Sansonetti, and combat vet Christopher Watts. [dramatic music] Going into Mount Olympus, I plan on tapping into the training from when I was in the Army. -[Liam] Chris has the lead! -I've jumped over walls, climbed ropes. I do have some agility on my side. Go, Chris! Whoo! Seeing my mother out there in the crowd definitely fuels me to keep going. [Alex] Chris Watts is going to Mount Olympus! I didn't come here to lose this thing. I came here to win. My edge on Mount Olympus is my strength. [Alex] Oh, my goodness! Look at that Frank! I'm the bigger guy. I'm the taller guy. I'm the stronger guy. I'm a beast, man. I'm going all the way. [cheers and applause] We got two studs here. It's the firefighter versus a soldier. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that both of you guys are true heroes, {\an7}and after this is over, you're still going to be heroes, but only one of you will be a Titan. Frank, Christopher, this is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] [Liam] Frank in the red. Chris in the blue. [Alex] Whoa, Chris took a flying leap and didn't make a dent! But the Tank threw the wall down like it's nothing with those big guns. [grunting] [Liam] And now Chris has it down and heads to the Gates of Olympus. But Frank is on fire right now. [Alex] 6'3", 245 pounds. The dude is a monster. But Chris Watts is not to be outclassed as he is managing to push up the Gates of Olympus. [Liam] Curious to see how Frank handles the Rolling Ascent. Remember, the firefighter was a beast on Atlas Smash, but brute strength alone means nothing here. You need speed, balance, and agility. [Alex] And that's where I think Chris Watts is going to shine. We saw how the combat veteran dominated on Heavy Metal. Take a look at Chris's technique. Meanwhile, big Frank, he's struggling to get on top of that first one. [both groan] [Alex] Chris has already reached the top. Ah, wow. Look at Chris. [Liam] Now Chris is heading up to The Cliffs. This is where you punch and kick holes, making your own path to the top. [grunts] Frank is having a world of problems. -Come on, Frank. -He's too top-heavy, Liam. He can't get far enough forward. [grunts] [grunting] Come on, baby! Come on, baby! Go! [Liam] This is a nightmare for Frank right now. On the other side, {\an7}Chris Watts is already on top of Mount Olympus and is at the torch. - Whoo! -[Alex] We saw how Chris dominated the crank on Heavy Metal. You'd expect him to shine here as well. [grunts] Frank Sansonetti just cannot get past this at all. While Frank struggles, Chris continues to impress. And Chris Watts, he has managed to raise the torch! And now it's time to descend Mount Olympus. Come on, Chris. [Liam] 60 feet to the bottom, and Chris shows no sign of slowing down. Three walls in the way... five, six, then seven feet. Frank is stuck. Remember, he said, "I'm powerful. I'm the strongest guy here." But right now, his challenge, it's not about strength, and his struggle continues. Look at this. Chris is already on the return flight, while Frank is still stuck in the security line. [Alex] I think Atlas Smash just took too much out of the firefighter. Oh, my God, go! Come on. Pure frustration for Frank. No matter what he does, he can't get up this mountain. Man. [grunts] Meanwhile, Chris Watts marching across -the arena floor. -[grunts] Come on, Chris. Attaboy. Dragging that 250-pound ball and chain -over to the Titan tomb. -[grunts] You got this! You got this! And what a moment for Chris's Mom. The first time she sees her son in two years {\an7}[Alex] He is looking pretty, as he's now hacking away at the Titan tomb. And Frank Sansonetti is in roller hell right now. He just cannot get past it. And this soldier cannot be stopped! [dramatic music] [Liam] An American hero, served three years in the Army, a Purple Heart recipient, now steps away from the title of Titan. [Alex] Chris Watts hold the relic in his hands. Whoo! And he is your Titan! Congratulations, brother. Great job. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Come here. I love you. I am so proud of you, Titan! Whoo! {\an7}[Alex] Frank the Tank slammed {\an7}through that 1,000-pound wall, but the Rolling Ascent was more like quicksand for the big man. {\an7}Chris's combination of speed, power, and agility {\an7}was flawless, and secured him the title of Titan. Congratulations on being a Titan, and, uh, I thank you for your service. All right, thank you, bro. [dramatic music] For those crowned as Titans tonight, their stories don't end here. Later this season, they will return here for the Battle of the Titans. In the end, one woman and one man will be crowned Titan Champion. Now, Jasmin Guinn and Jess Griffith face the ultimate test. Going into Mount Olympus, my edge over Jasmin is I have been trained to {\an7}perform under immense pressure. I was a trauma nurse in St. Louis, but I am now a nutrition coach and specialist. -Hey. How are you? -Hey. I wanted to take care of people that wanted to help themselves, and prevent them from coming to the ER. So I want to start with talking about supplements. -Okay. [Cari] Jess likes to practice what she preaches. Training is like her second job. My workouts are very intense. I go to the gym twice a day. First session is usually about two hours, and second session is usually about three hours. Working through the pain? I do that all the time. And so, I don't think there's a girl here that will beat me. Jessica Griffith looks like one of the strongest women here, but I'm used to pushing my body to its limits. [Alex] Look at that! Jasmin gets it in just a few moves! My senior year of basketball, I tore two ligaments and a tendon in my left foot. That was pretty much how I ended my career. But it doesn't matter how far you fall. It's just about how far you get up. If I want to become a Titan, I have to conquer that mountain. [cheers and applause] Jasmin and Jess, I can't wait to see the two of you go head-to-head. You're both such fierce competitors. {\an7}All your hard work has led you to this moment. Seize it, and define your legacy. This is Mount Olympus. [dramatic music] [Liam] Jess in the blue. Jasmin in the red. Strength right off the bat. [Alex] It's off to that 1,000-pound wall, and both of these women throw it down at the same time. Now it's on to the Gates of Olympus. [grunts] Wow. [Liam] More of a full-body strength here. You need the upper body. You need the lower body and the core, and right now, both women managing it very well. [Alex] Jess is a little bit ahead, but by a hair. Jasmin is right behind her, and they are flying through the... Oh, Jasmin gets hung up there on the third one. [Liam] But Jess is charging right into The Cliffs. [Alex] Wow, the trauma nurse is blasting through that wall! And here comes Jasmin. Let's go, Jasmin. Come on. [Alex] Last week, this artist would have been painting a mural on a wall. Now she's destroying this one. [dramatic music] -Ahh! -Oh! [Alex] Oh, my goodness! Jess Griffith just fell! Let's go, Jess. [Liam] That opens the door for Jasmine. Come on, Jasmin. Get up there. It is time to punch your way through, but you have to be careful. You don't want to make the holes too big like Jess just did. It's just a slight hold. Get your hand and your feet in and get up. [grunting] [dramatic music] [grunts] -[Alex] Oh! -[Liam] And Jasmin's down! [grunts] [Alex] Oh, my word! Oh, that's not good. [wails] [breathing heavily] [Alex] Oh, man, that is something you just do not want to see, but Jess has no idea. She's off to start cranking that wheel. [grunts] [dramatic music] [wincing] [Liam] At the top, Jasmin lost her footing and landed awkwardly on her right leg. Remember, we heard her talk about her leg injury back in college as a basketball player. Let's hope this isn't too serious. But that does not look good. [grunts] [Alex] Jess has her torch up, and she's beginning her descent down the mountain. She's storming ahead, but watch... Look at this! Jasmin is getting back up! She's going to keep going! -There you go, Jasmin! -[Alex] What? - Be careful. -[Liam] This is incredible. Can't put any weight on that right leg, but still trying to make her way up top of Mount Olympus. [Alex] Just the fact that she got up, Liam, speaks volumes. [grunts] [Liam] But don't let this take anything away from what we're seeing from Jess Griffith right now. She's already on the arena floor. She's got her eye on the prize, getting to DJ and becoming a Titan. [Alex] Jasmin makes it up! I can't believe this! [Liam] But look at Jess. Power on display right here. Dragging that 200-pound ball and chain with one hand! [Alex] And Jasmin's at the torch. She's also just using one arm. Because she has to hold herself up with the other one. Unbelievable! [Liam] That's the heart of a Titan, Goldenboy. You're good. [Alex] Jess, though, on the floor now starting to hack away at the Titan tomb so she can take out that relic. And Jasmin, how is she doing this? [Liam] The torch is lit. [Alex] The willpower of this woman! [dramatic music] [Liam] Jess hammering away. Five hours a day in the gym. She said she'd never get outworked, and right now, she's proving it. And Jasmin Guinn, an artist, an athlete, and someone who just isn't going to be denied. [groans] [grunts] But Jess digging in the Titan tomb. [dramatic music] And she has it. [Alex] Jess has the relic! [Liam] Jasmin Guinn won our hearts, but Jess Griffin is a force to be reckoned with. [Alex] She locks it in! Jess Griffith is our Titan! -Wow. -Amazing! Good job! -So good. -That was awesome. [Alex] I cannot believe what we just saw, not only from Jess Griffith, our new Titan, but Jasmin Guinn. She has earned everyone's respect here in the Titan Arena. Good job, Jas! Good job! [Liam] We've seen this mountain best some of the strongest athletes in the world, but it couldn't take down Jasmin Guinn. So it's former trauma nurse Jess Griffith who will be moving on to our Battle of the Titans in a few weeks. [cheers and applause] Great job. You were amazing. Great job. Thank you. [Alex] Both women fell at The Cliffs. Jess Griffith recovered and powered through the remaining stages. Jasmin suffered an injury, but heroically rose again and with a remarkable determination, fought until the very end. Two inspiring efforts, but only Jess continues on in this competition. [dramatic music] You have earned this. Congratulations. -Thank you so much. -Great job. Great job. You were amazing. {\an7}[Liam] So with Jess and Chris, we've locked half our team of Titans. {\an7}Next week, we're back to find two more. And in a few weeks, they'll all face off in the Battle of the Titans. -See you next week on Titan Games. [dramatic music] [dramatic music]
