 Who needs an app? This is my life. How are you two? Hi. Proposed redundancies? Drakes, Cobley... Me? Morning. Jesus... They're, erm... They're just proposals. Aren't they?

 All right? What's up? I'm meant to be taking him for a biopsy. His name's Ralph. Ralph Walsh. He's 87. A nice old boy. I've been knocking, but no answer. Ralph? Ralph, it's the police. We're going to have to break in. There might be some noise. Here, pass us that brick, Drake. Old folk, hey? Ralph? Ralph? Are you in here, mate? Just give us a minute, yeah? - Ralph? - Mr Walsh?

 Are you all right, mate? Ralph, it's the police. Sorry, Sean. Islands In The Stream, Up Where We Belong, Don't Give Up. It's all duets. Poor sod. His Dolly Parton departed. The old boy was RAF. Right, Ralph, are you in here? Shit... He's been robbed! Tell me about it. The old loop and tug. A coat hanger through to the latch and you're in. Why don't they fit bloody deadlocks? Well, when Ralph gets home from wherever he is, you can ask him. No wonder the old folks around here are always getting robbed. The burglar's left us a present. We're going to get this little toerag. 'This weekend, the Boston Historic And Antiques Show, a celebration of Lincolnshire's past. Come and see the spectacular... - things nobody wants or needs any more. - Grandpa would like it. You know, it's not too late to send him a birthday card. I'll get it. The last mailing day is Thursday! 600 job cuts over four years. Do you care to comment, Chief Constable? Wait... Where did you get that information? Your redundancy proposals were leaked last night. Hi, Mr Hixon. Nice jimjams. Dad, this is Astrid. We're going to get the bus together. Unless you have any objections... Did Grandpa judge your friends, too? He put some of my friends in front of an actual judge. How many beat cops are going to lose their jobs because of your DNA thingy? You've already cut night shifts by 40%. The custody suite in Skegvegas isn't even manned on a Saturday night. I mean, Saturday night! You're going to have to speak to me sooner or later, William. Muriel, you're going to be all right. You're still young. You've got transferable skills. What about me, hey? Hey, Ralph Walsh. Old person. Breaking and entry at Fenmarsh. He's probably staying with his sister in Grimsby or he might be playing hide the Spitfire with one of the old widow wenches. What? Even my old dad cleans up at Fenmarsh. He's an ugly bastard. - Was there much taken? - It looks like it, yeah. Empty jewellery boxes, draws pulled out. We got a glove, though. The lab's squeezing it for DNA juice. - So, we got a DNA hit? - Do you hear a noise, Muriel? Sounds a bit like someone castrating a ferret. And you'd know exactly what that sounds like, wouldn't you? Is it true? The cuts? The redundancies aren't finalised. - This process is going to take a few weeks. - Weeks? - So, DNA. Yes? No? - Yes, Muriel. The labs say they've got a hit. Great. Send it my way. It's exactly what I need. Ha! I know exactly what you need. Let's catch this guy quick and make it a good news day. Why do you care so much? It's only a burglary. - Don't worry. - Cheers. I'll see what I can find at Ralph's. Grandma's frisky, number 60. Chief Constable Bill Hixon, serving the community. You're on a lucky streak. I got your message. You really want to talk about police job cuts here? Yes. And I realise that Lisa doesn't want a boring story, she wants a real story. Like, "Boston pensioners still going strong." "They fought a war and they don't need Bill Hixon." Print any of them. "Boston pensioners' safety sacrificed" "to fund top cop's supercomputer." Supercomputer? This isn't 1979. It's a database. How about this for a story...? "Octogenarian Ralph Walsh, home robbed, ransacked." "Watch 21st-century tech catch who did it." What, so you're saying that your DNA thing, that that's going to catch the thief? - Is that a promise? - Promises are for children, Lisa. OK, so, Bill... - Excuse me. - Rise and shine, 29. Yes, Muriel. Give me the good news. Have you got our suspect in custody? A touch of Chinese whispers. The DNA isn't on file. Muriel, I need this. Cobley said you had a match. Yeah, well, Cobley says a lot of things. The best we've got is a partial match to someone who works at Boston Library. Excuse me, I'm looking for Alma Smith. Smith comma Alma. Chick lit. Nothing coming up. Sorry. You're Alma Smith. I take my laughs where I can get them. You're... Canadian. American. I knew that. I just don't like insulting people to their faces. I'm Chief Constable Bill Hixon. Are you OK? I felt amazing at happy hour. This morning... not so much. Hey, hey, Shelley, love. That plastic shatters. All right, I'm going to take that. But I'll give you that. You're good with kids. Do you have any? No, it's just me. No nieces, nephews, nothing. Not even a cat. Is this leading somewhere? - Are you all right, Bernie? - Yeah. Re-shelf them returns for me, will you? Sure. You were cautioned a few weeks ago about harassing a PCSO. It was a demo against the library cuts. And I didn't harass him. I might have puked on him a little. This was also after happy hour? When you were at the station, your DNA was put on file. - It's a permanent programme. - I know, I read The Stump. So, what have I done now? It's not you. But your DNA was a partial match to a crime scene. - I don't follow. - We're looking for your father. Join the fucking queue. - Still no sign? - No. Is the bedroom down here? There was this guy, John, Joe maybe. He used to hang around the flat when I was little. And you think he might have been your father? He was my dad, but Mum didn't tell me about him until she was dying. Too late by then, he was gone for good. He didn't even leave his name on my birth certificate. Actually, you know what? This... is pretty much the last time that I saw him. Got your work cut out, haven't you, if he's had a haircut or got lenses? He could be anyone by now. So, what's he done, then? John. - Or Joe. - Burglary. You were expecting something different? Well... From the stories I've heard about him, I was expecting something worse. - Has anyone checked the garage? - Not yet, no. Chest freezer. No, I'm not opening that. I've got form with freezers and body parts. Jesus... Give me a hand with all this crap, Drakes. It's all right, he's not in here. I know. You promised the media that your DNA database would catch a burglar. Oops, it hasn't. And now we're looking for a killer. It's very cute, you called The Stump "the media". Keith won't find it cute. Pensioners are his core electorate. He's big at Fenmarsh. You'd better be on your way to nab the bastard. Lydia, I'm not really in the nabbing business. I promise you, progress is being made somewhere. We don't even have a current ID for this guy. Father of Alma Smith, possibly called John or Joe. No-one's seen him in 15 years. Er, where the bloody hell are you going? They're your cuts. Face the music. I'm letting the music seep in a little. Nobody likes a song the first time they hear it. Well, it's not the first time I've heard it. And I still don't like it. I didn't promise. Pathology says his heart went. But what caused it to go? One more pill, one less, a hand over the mouth... I mean, even a good hard shout in his ear might have pushed it. But then, where we found him... Ralph didn't roll himself up in that carpet. Thank you for this. Erm, you knew him from the library? History and stuff. Mainly world wars. It's this way, love. That's Ralph Walsh. I think you'd better find my dad, don't you? Pre-trial interview terminated. Time 14:23. You will be arraigned next Thursday. Come on, why am I really here, Detective? Do you know him? Last seen about 15 years ago. Old-school housebreaker, a broken window, coat hanger, loop and tug. Enjoying this, aren't you, Yeardsley? I heard about the redundancies. It looks like I got out just in time. I'd still rather be me. You know, walking out of here tonight. Hixon's a "see you next Tuesday". He'll end up in Miami Beach. What about you? Selling candyfloss on Cleethorpes Pier. Our friend's impressed with you. He helps those who help him. His companies need security advisers, maybe even a head of security... Do you recognise him or not? You've got something Oleg wants. You took that coffee cup, didn't you? I went back for it, it wasn't there. That cup could give me cause for a mistrial. Hixon's screwed with evidence. It could save both our skins. Wait! We lifted a loop and tug mid-'90s. Notorious housebreaker, he was. No swabs then. He liked to pick on the oldies. Check the arrest files for August '94. Look for Henry Reeves. Do your homework, Clarice. I don't think she's going to press charges. - It was her sister who hit her. - We're not here for that. You want a statement. I heard about poor Ralph. Poor Ralph, is it? Come on. Hey! I'm Henry Reeves, but that's not me. Look, I've kept my bib clean for years. Yeah, well, your signature's all over it. Old people, a wire coat hanger, the lot. You've trimmed your beard and lost your glasses, but temptation doesn't leave, does it? Maybe Ralph was already dead when you broke in. So you helped yourself. Why not? And then you called us. Just tell us what happened. - It's still not me. - Prove it. Once I get onto that system, I'll never get off. I know you lot. '999 call, altercation, possible stabbing. - Look, we've got urgent call-outs. - I don't care if the whole town croaks. There's only one way out of here, Henry. Was it John back then or Joe? JonJo. JonJo Ryan. That's his name. I knew him. JonJo taught me all the tricks. He was a real pro. So, I got caught, he didn't. JonJo Ryan? So you were his accomplice. Funny you didn't mention it back then. If you knew JonJo, you wouldn't either. I ain't seen him since. So, he's back. And killing now. Jesus, what time is it? I've got to go. I don't think Grandpa likes me. That's the first Lord Harborough. He led Henry VIII's massed troops against a handful of unarmed monks who had previously occupied this area of prime real estate. So, your family stole this land from God? When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, only Lincolnshire fought back. Henry called it "the most brute and beastly shire in the realm". Then he never saw Skegness on a Saturday night. There is a kind of Harborough look. If you get rid of the beard. Nice detective work, Chief Hixon. Unfortunately, my own origins are rather more brute and beastly. Yeah? An illicit affair between a chambermaid and a 13th Duke? Adopted. So, you see, we do have something in common. Neither of us quite knows where we belong. You never seem out of place to me. You're doing that staring thing again. Either you're getting a reflection off that glass - or you're feeling guilty about something. - Reading Alma's file. She was only ten when her mother died. No dad. No family. So, she would have gone to foster care. What would that look like here? Well, there are good stories. - And, erm, not such good stories. - Yeah. Dads... So... Do we have our killer? So, this is where they've been hiding the nightlife? - Well, it is on Tuesdays. - Lager. I just get two for one on spirits. The guy you arrested. Has he coughed for it yet? The right MO, the right age, the right myopia. But it's not him. I didn't think it was. I know Henry. He drinks in here. - He's not my dad. - No, he's not. And forensics proves it. He's exactly who he says he is. A reformed robber. He knew your dad, JonJo. They robbed houses together. I didn't know you were so young when you lost your mom. Was I under some obligation to tell you? No. Sorry. You grow up and learn. You... learn to keep your stuff to yourself. Have you and your missus got kids? A daughter, 14. And the missus... Is missed. Yeah, I can tell. It's good you've got each other. So... - What now? - We got your dad's DNA from the glove. We'll keep looking. So, if something happens, I'll let you know. - Is that it? - For now. Kelsey! Alma called. What you said last night jogged her memory. She thinks there's a recent death that might be suspicious. It's out in Fenmarsh, the same place Ralph Walsh lived. It might be we've missed another murder. Welcome to Fenmarsh. Home to the elderly and housebound. Which may or may not explain why the most popular loan every month is bleeding Pet Cemetery. This is Nora. Just tell them, Nora, what you told me about Stanley. Well, I came in from Aldi, and he was lying just there. All twisted, like. The report says the attic ladder was down. They think he tried to climb it and his heart gave out. Can I ask, was he buried? We could do an autopsy, see if there's anything suspicious. We burned him. Six weeks ago, Thursday. And I baked him into bits and pieces. I heard it on Loose Women. It helps you feel he's still with you. Not those biscuits, though. At least, I don't think so. And it was around the time Stanley died you were burgled? I think so. But it's all a bit of a blur, you know, with what happened. He never went up there. No matter how much I nagged him to. I just don't understand. Do you think someone did something to my Stanley? - What do you think? - I think it's just what it looks like. He climbed the ladder, had a heart attack. Sir... I think you need to see this. It's the same as at Ralph's. Classic loop and tug. Cut the window, stick a coat hanger through. Whoever it is is clearly targeting old folk. That is definitely not Nora's. The same MO as Ralph, sir. Shit. Forensics from the two crime scenes match, sir. The DNA's back from the hair follicles. It's JonJo again. Alma's dad. So, we have two possible victims, Ralph Walsh and Stanley Green. Well, so far, sir. Who knows how many there might be? It's the tip of the iceberg. We might have missed loads of others. Is this really happening, Bill? Well, I don't know. In the Sartrean sense or the Nietzschean sense? Yes, your size sevens are on my desk. And, yes, we have a murderer who's preying on seniors. Why couldn't the toerag target junkies or children too young to vote? What leads do you have? Well, we know who he is, we just don't know where he is. No. Nobody knows. In an age of Snapchat, where I can send pictures of my genitals to anybody in the world, we can't find one bearded scrote in the least populated region of England. I mean, somebody doesn't completely disappear just like that, do they? We do a record. Bloody ridiculous. And this is on you, by the way. You and your bloody stupid promises. I didn't promise. - Yes, you did. - I did not! You did. I didn't promise! Who the hell are you, JonJo? Every time, Dad. Every time someone knocks... you put this on. Yeah? - Yeah. - And... - double lock. - Got it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Have you got it? - Yes! OK. I've got to go. I was told you were back here. Are you still telling it like it is, Lisa? What's the headline today? "Old folks too scared to go to seniors' bingo" "after two OAPs murdered by a night-time raider." It's not true. Don't write it. What part? Two deaths or two burglaries? Who told you? You just did. Or at least you confirmed it. In fairness, I never doubted my source. Very few people knew about this. Who was it, a disgruntled cop? I never believe a word the police tell me. Did The Stump pay for that hangover? Why did you tell them the old men were murdered? I thought you'd be out there getting DNA off everybody. Finding him. That's your pitch, isn't it? Anyone, anywhere. Sorry. I'm a bit wrecked. If you keep drinking, you'll get fired. Fired? Nobody else wants this job. You've seen them round here. In the summer, it's the heat. In the winter, it's the cold. All year round, it's the loneliness. This is England. We hate our old folk. We don't visit them. We don't listen to them. We cut their fuel allowances. We sell them broadband when they don't even have a computer. And sometimes we break into their house, thump them on the head, steal their jewellery and shit in their beds. Alma, you knew both Ralph and Stanley and they borrowed books from here. Yeah. Maybe I killed them. I'm just trying to find your father. You don't think I tried to find him? I thought you lot would do better. It stood to reason, he had a record. He never held down a job. God knows where he came from. It seemed like he only turned up to knock my mum about. You lot looked for him when my mum died, but... he was well gone. And he left his shitty motorbike. And my mum sold that for three bottles of Buckfast. I hate him. You're not your father. You care about people. But you drink too much. I get why. But I wish you wouldn't. I'm coming, Bernie. It's not you. It's him. You left this on my desk. It's been playing Living In The Prayer for the last ten minutes. That'll be my office. It says "school" nine times. Excuse me. A picture paints a thousand words. Security cameras, a little more. Sneaking unsuitable boys and alcohol into school grounds is not the Queen Anne's way. I have no choice but to suspend Kelsey. She is refusing to cooperate with our investigation. Investigation? - We didn't kill the unsuitable boys. - Kelsey! I'm so sorry. I don't know what's gotten into her. I heard what happened. I went to Queen Anne's myself. I sit on the school board. Astrid's got form. Then why is Kelsey the only one who's suspended? Astrid's parents are Van Dorans. So, any trouble gets buried under the new swimming pool her parents just paid for. Kelsey wants to leave Queen Anne's. It's not for everyone. Should I let her? I'm not exactly qualified to give that sort of advice. I would make a terrible mother. I'm not... I'm not sure I've got that sort of love in me. Well, I was terrified of Kelsey when Ruth died. I just thought Kelsey would break apart at any moment. And Ruth was never like that, though. She would just get in there and scoop her up. You said it was a couple of years ago now, but... We'd been skiing, just Ruth and I, and she fell. Hit her head. Had a headache, but seemed fine. Went to sleep that night and... never woke up. So, now I've got to learn how to... scoop up my daughter. JonJo Ryan, a petty thief, who disappeared 15 years back. He's recently resurfaced. He's still using his old MO, the classic loop and tug. He worked with Henry Reeves back in the day, but he's now operating solo. And this time, he has a possible two murders to add to his name. He's a loner. Private. Aggressively so. But he's starting to take chances. This is what we think he looks like now. He's cruel. More calculated, as opposed to opportunistic. - He targets the isolated and vulnerable. - Sounds familiar. Known victims are old men. Unresolved father issues, maybe. The trouble is... Excuse me. DC Yeardsley, thank you. Cobley, do you want to stop sucking on your teeth? This is a very valuable profile. DC Yeardsley, thank you for that. And I can't believe I'm going to say this, but... we're not going to find this guy behind a PowerPoint. We need boots on the ground, we need to go door to door. Let's get his image out there, let's get it in the public's faces. That way they're more likely to work with our DNA swabs, maybe give us a lead that's actionable. - It sounds a lot like... - Overtime, PC Cobley. You see, I can say the word. Find him. Nobody disappears into thin air. We've got officers taking DNA in Wrangle, Freestone and Butterwick. And in South Boston, we're distributing JonJo Ryan Photofits. There you go, that's what I'm talking about. Hey... You haven't just been sitting there all day, have you? Just because you're suspended doesn't mean... I think that's exactly what it means. Suspended in time and space, like the kale in your smoothie. Maybe I should talk to the school. - Grovel a little. - Because it's the best school? And the best schools make the best people, right? You know what, grab your coat. There's somewhere I need to be and you need some fresh air. Bernie! This is a library! Bernie... Could you tell Alma that Bill Hixon is here to see her? No. This is my daughter Kelsey. I need to update her on the investigation. She's having a duvet day. She's sick. She's sick quite a lot with her drinking, isn't she? Alma doesn't drink. Not alcohol. Sure. Can I borrow this, please? You do not have a library card. And I hear there's quite a waiting list for this particular title. Ralph Walsh borrowed this. Bernie was right. Alma's sick. All right, everyone. Muriel, Sean and, er... Chewie. OK, listen up. What is it, sir? Dead men do not return library books. Henry. Are you OK? I need a drink. You do, don't you? What's up? I've just come from Skirbeck. A nice old geezer. Tony Cobley. Heart gave out. I've taken the body down to the morgue, but the police haven't been to his flat yet. They reckon they can't get there for at least a couple of hours. Shit. I'm sorry. JonJo's your dad. He didn't say. Do you want me to tell you all that stuff about him? How we used to rob back in the day. All the tricks of the trade. - What was that all about? - I don't know. I'm sorry. Never mind. I'd rather drink alone. If JonJo is back... I wouldn't want to meet him down some dark alley. Hello? You... Henry said you were... Alma, Alma... Stop. We know what you did. You left us a very good trail. This is your father's glove, isn't it? The one you left for us at Ralph's. You knew we'd find his DNA on it. But at Nora's you used the hair from the bike helmet. It's all I had of him. - Has she been drinking again? - That's enough. She doesn't drink. She's sick. I'm dying, Bill. I know you are, sweetheart. I know you are. The only other thing I got from my dad. HH blood, one in a million. So, only you would be a match for a transplant. Do you know how many HH livers have come up on the transplant list? Not one, ever. I'm sorry. Bloody Pet Cemetery. I should have left it on Ralph's bedside. But you know the waiting list on that modern classic. Ralph didn't show up at the library. - He was never late with his returns. - You realised he could help you. Make it look like he'd been murdered, robbed. - You wanted us to help you find your dad. - Stupid. I didn't think that it would work. It was a good try... what you did. Talking to The Stump. Nora's house. You kept us interested. Don't think I didn't try everything else to find my dad. He just... disappeared. He didn't want me. He didn't know you. The last time I saw him... it was the middle of the night. I woke up, he was sitting on my bed. He seemed upset. He told me the devil had got his soul. He's dead, isn't he? We're going to keep looking for him. But I think you're right. Poor Ralph was slumped over the kitchen table when I found him. It's a terrible thing to be on your own. It's terrible. The news is out. Some praise, for once. It won't last. Not much does. Yeah, well, Yeardsley, it's not personal. You're an above-average detective. Miles above. You care. Not everybody does. Thanks. Well, I did an above-average check on the server. - Guess what I found? - That I leaked the cuts. It's the best and easiest way to get the information out there. And you're fine. You're young. Cobley isn't. The best thing he can hope for is watchman in Iceland. It's a shop. And you don't know I'll be fine, neither. The governors met this morning and it has been determined that Kelsey will serve a suspension of no less... Suspensions run in our family. And quitting, too. What if we looked at this in a different light? I'm a man of means. What if I said that I would pay for a resurfacing of the sports court? - Or maybe building a new library? - Well... Obviously, we'd have to look at all aspects of... - Dad! - I wasn't going to do it. I just wanted to see the look on her face when I asked. God, we just outsource everything, don't we? From our kids to our parents, who pay other people to do the things we don't want to do. Teachers and nurses to wipe their arses so we don't have to. It doesn't work. Doesn't work for them, doesn't work for us. It works for you. I mean, look at your handbag. What does that cost? 2,500 bucks? I was just at a hospital with a girl. Five of those handbags would have bought her a new liver. It would have saved her life. That, or a dad who cared about her. I don't blame you. You're just a brochure in human form. But you shouldn't pretend to care. And we shouldn't pretend to believe you. Sorry, Kels, I fucked up another school for you. Sorry? That was cool. Let's get out of here. Don't deceive yourself, Mr Hixon. Your daughter was the prime mover in this sordid event. Her accomplice, Miss Van Doran, told us everything. That is the only reason Astrid is being treated leniently. I'm sorry, could you say that again? You let one of them off for ratting out the other? You gave us Henry Reeves. But you knew it was his accomplice all along, didn't you? JonJo Ryan, he gave up Henry, didn't he? I'm willing to bet a few others. JonJo gave up half the crims in South Boston. Out of the goodness of his heart? Maybe. Maybe he found a conscience. Or maybe he knew a good deal when he saw one. Immunity for information. Where is he? We know you know. What's in it for me? You get to save a girl's life. No. A girl's life doesn't cut it for me. What else have you got? No! Take a walk. Take a walk, now. Go fuck yourself. What about you, hey, Muriel? What have you got that might save a girl's life? Come on. It's just a bloody coffee cup. How bad do you want JonJo Ryan? I don't know what made that bastard Blair change his mind. Does it matter? Maybe he found a conscience, like JonJo did. Yeah, I'm not a woman, I'm a cop. Not in the eyes of God, Yeardsley. Hi. I called. I'm looking for a JonJo Ryan. Come in. JonJo Ryan's dead. I'm sorry. I'm not. He was a nasty bastard. St Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuit order, he'd been a nasty bastard, too. He believed we had to walk in the shoes of Christ. Perinde ac cadaver. My Latin's a little rusty, but that's something about a corpse. It's only when we give up on this life... can we be reborn in Jesus. You're JonJo Ryan. You were JonJo Ryan. Well, I've been looking for you. You want to talk about the past. I don't. What about Alma? Can we talk about her? I was poison for her. Yeah. You were. But you have something that only a father can give her now.
