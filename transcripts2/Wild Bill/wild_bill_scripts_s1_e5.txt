 This is Skeltoft Farm Camp. We offer good work in a variety of sectors, liaising with the Home Office, ensuring that all immigration paperwork is bang up to date. Warm, comfortable accommodation, with a choice of private or shared rooms. Your every need is catered for, with communal kitchens and laundries. I'm Darren Bailey, owner of Skeltoft Farm Camp. Skeltoft, it's a great place to live and work. What are you shooting at, the ozone layer?

 - There hasn't been a bird all morning. - Yeah, I know. I just like firing the ruddy thing. You're right, though. There's nowt happening here. There's no bloody beaters. Home Office immigration crackdown. Every time they send out those enforcement vans, half the county disappears underground. If I knew he was coming, I would have worn a wire. Now, then, Oleg. Won't you lend us a couple of your lads? Yeah, they're good at beating. Your nation's reliance on migrant labour is going to destroy it from the inside. - Oh, so you're not a migrant? - I'm not slave labour. I'm a high-net-worth individual.

 Like us. ~ You're welcome. But I'm not Polish. - Charlene Bailey. - Oh, you're Darren Bailey's daughter? He was supposed to join us today. - Er, he had something come up. - Aye. A bottle of Jose Cuervo and the kebab that he had after it, knowing your dad, eh? Yep. This is what I joined up for. Investigating fly-tipping. That's going to make a mess of your car. Maklov 1000. Sounds foreign. What are you doing? - There could be anything in there. - Yeah, there could be. There could be hard drugs, there could be the Hitler diaries, weapons of mass destruction, plutonium, whatever. If it washes up somewhere, it'll be West Lincs'. They can deal with it. I'm off. West Lincs is that way. I'm glad you've made a friend here. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You know, you both have a lot in common. Your parents are both cops. You're kind of outsiders. He's gay. You're American. It's like you designed him yourself. A cop's son with no interest in dating your daughter. Do you really think I'm that controlling? Please. If you could create an algorithm that would predict my behaviour, you would. What makes you think I haven't? So, I guess I'm no longer grounded? Man, she's good. I have no idea why I'm doing this. Because Keith's going. And why is Keith going? Because he likes to have his photo taken in front of the immigration enforcement vans. It plays to his electorate. So, I'm spending my day watching my force protect immigration teams so Keith can get re-elected? You were hired to get Keith re-elected. Don't you love democracy? All right, boys, let's go put on a show! You almost look like real cops. Skeltoft is a lot like Compton, sir. Just more polka, less hip-hop. Right, best we go and babysit Border Control. Keep moving. - Welcome to the front line, Bill. - I almost feel at home. All you need is a 30-foot wall and some better Mexican food. You remember Charlene. You have a problem with your permits? My dad usually sorts all of this stuff. I told the enforcement officer to wait, but he's not listening. - Hurry up. Get in the van. - My wife is with me! Here. Give it to me. You entertain the gentleman with the expensive shoes. - Hurry up! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen. I know you have your quota, but I have my quota, too. And these workers are late to pick your two-for-one broccoli. - Let's go. - This is a joke. These five have permits, you idiot. - It looks like you lot jumped the gun. - Fuck you! - Who's that? - That's Lubica. Dad's girlfriend. Lucky old Dad. You do yoga, Charlene? The mala bracelet? I used to, yeah. Used to do a lot of things, did Charl. Yoga, pilates, meditation... You name it, she's quit it. We haven't met. I'm DJ. This is my brother Matthew. Sorry Dad's not here. Keith knows his way to his drinks cabinet, mind. Yeah, well, nowt changes, does it? Come on. - What's up with you? - Get in. Do I recognise you? - Erm, Muriel Yeardsley. - Muriel, from school? Yeah! Muriel, it's been... .. six days now since I last saw my dad. He's not answering his phone? He can't, can he? Cos he left it behind. Immigration officers... Knobheads, the lot of them. So, you went to school with her? The teachers used her as a cautionary tale. You know, "Don't do a Bailey," they'd say. Drink, drugs, she got pregnant at 14. 14? Jesus, my daughter's 14. Well, she's right to be worried. See what you can find on that phone. The password to Darren Bailey's phone is DJ's birthday. The 8th of the 9th 1989. 8989. His son and heir. Any data on the SIM? There's something gnarly, sir. He's got access to the camp's CCTV on his phone. There's cameras everywhere. The Polish lads on my farm say that Darren Bailey is a total control freak. He always seems to know what people are up to. And now we know how. - Any sign of him leaving the camp? - Not yet. But, I mean, there's loads of it. Who's that? It's his girlfriend. She's in a nightgown in the rain. Is that the night he left? Yeah, it is. I suppose I'd better go down there, have a quiet chat. Take Drakes and Cobley with you. I don't want you going down there alone. What's she doing? More like, what has she done? Why are we back here? What do you think is in that case? It's more what I'm hoping is not in there. Caught yourself a conscience? Well, the question is, what's more stupid, kicking it in the river or coming back here to fish it out? Aye. It is a dilemma. Hey... There you go. You can settle it. Oh...! Come on. There you go. I'm sorry. Your dad was found near Frith Bank. How? How was he killed? The pathologist believes it was a blow to the back of the head. It's still early days, so there's tests to be done. Come on, Charlene. There's 400 in this camp and 90% of them would happily slit our throats. We're trying to talk here, Charl. She can cry wherever she wants. It's her home too, right? And her father. Dad's gone. Why are you still here? I cared for your father, DJ. Oh, you cared for him? I thought you loved him? At least his money. He always knew you were shagging around behind his back. Do not speak nonsense, you little man! All right, easy. We're just talking to her. That night, she was ranting and raving like a maniac. - I heard her through the walls. - I wasn't ranting at him, DJ. I was fucking him! I want you out. Now! Lubica! So, you think the same? I was fucking him for money. But earlier on...? I mean, I wasn't fucking him for his looks. A marriage of convenience. Yeah, without the marriage. Or is your marriage less convenient? Less convenient, the way it ended. I thought he would come through this door full of sorries and presents. We saw you on CCTV in your nightgown in the rain. You looked pretty upset. He's right. We did have an argument. Not unusual for us. Economics degree? It might surprise you to hear, this wasn't the life I dreamt of. Where will you go? Dorm eight has a spare bed. I rejoin the picking gang tomorrow. Here... Let me help you. Why would somebody do this to Dad? Did the company have any trouble? You know, unpaid debts or disputes. Dad didn't say anything. Not to me. I'm sure you know, I was in rehab. I guess I'm a fuck-up next to someone like you, huh? We all fuck up. Believe me. Dorm rooms, kitchen, the bus picks up at 7:00am, drops off at 7:00pm. Is your dryer broken? Dryers and washers, £4 a load. That's why we use the greenhouse. £2 if you want to get your phone charged. They don't seem that cut up about Darren. Do they hate him that much? Can you blame them? Immigrants lead shitty lives in this country. - Some immigrants. - Hey... This wasn't exactly my dream, either. What will Charlene do? She lives for this one kind word from her father. And now she's never going to get it. I had my baby taken off me. Did you know that? No. I'm... I'm sorry. I've let him down, haven't I? My dad. Do you know, I remember you. After school, always rushing home to help on the farm. That's the life... My brothers' life now. I wasn't even in the running to take over the farm. Still, my dad calls me every night and asks advice on this, that, the tractor. Your dad asks you for advice? Yeah. Sometimes. Hey, honey, I'm going to make the two of... .. three of us something to eat. OK. Hello, Lydia's son. I thought that, er, when Alex goes home, tonight might be a good night for us to resume our Uno challenge... Mr Hixon, can I ask you something? Sure. How do you know when someone likes you? You know, like that. Well, a lot of times, you don't. You know, erm... .. I would just say you... .. go up to them and you pour your heart out. - Oh... - Life is short. So, you... .. go up to him or her and just really lay it on the line. You know, and the good news is, if you crash and burn, you have a good friend who can pick you back up. Yeah. - Hello? - Ah, Bill. Any truth to the story that Darren Bailey was so hated by his workers that they actually threw a party when they found out he was dead? Are you really going to insinuate that the foreign workers - rose up against him? - I wasn't. - But I think you just did. - Way to pour gasoline on the fire. I also read your article about the gold-digger, - worming her way into Darren's millions. - Lubica Varga. Yeah, she looks hot in those bikini pictures, too, hey? Please... Well, someone whacked him over the head. Just telling a story. Don't you think that story's been told enough round here? Huh. This is Darren Bailey, leave a message. ~ So, your father actually comes to you for advice? Yeah. We're close. We go bowling every Thursday. Every night since I were a kid. - Goddamn. - Take a listen to this, sir. ~ So, Matthew weren't kidding when he said everyone hated his dad. - What are they saying? - I don't know. I don't speak Slovenian. But you get the gist. There's loads of messages from all sorts. Six from some bloke called Tomas Kovac. I've sent Cobley and Drakes down to root out the ones we can identify. - Like Kovac. - What about the brothers Grimm? - They stand to inherit the place. - Their alibis check out. They spent the night drinking in Boston. I mean, they don't want their dad gone. They don't want to work that hard. The place shows a turnover of 8 million. - 8 million? - Mm. It's a goldmine. What if he isn't doing it on his own? You said Lubica had an economics degree. Maybe she's the brains. Tomas Kovac. Yeah, he looks like he could follow through on a phone threat. He could have dumped Darren's body in the suitcase. About that... They're looking for someone who dumped a body up at Frith Bank. But we know it was further up, don't we? Do we? I don't. Watch my back, Drakesy. I'm going in. We'd like a word, please, Mr Kovac. In private, if that's all right. You can say what you like in front of Lubica. She's a friend. Look, where were you last Tuesday night? Here. I'm here every day. Dimitri... You were here until the gym closed, 10:00pm. We signed in. We have to. It comes out of our wages. Everything does. I'm the best picker he had. And I was negative wages. Paying to work, that's slavery, no? Right... Three. Do you think someone killed Dad over money? Charlene, we're just covering bases. The last three years will do. Anything that's not in archive. I'm not sure where the accounts are kept. Lubica put a new system... That's them there. Here, look at the spreadsheets. Oh, this is a labyrinth. It'd take a forensic accountant six months to go through this shit. Well, if it's that complex, it's to hide something. Debts, laundering... Lubica is all over the accounts. Notes are in her handwriting. What happened here? Well, that's the most recent quarter, sir. Wait, what is it, sir? Sir...? Will you be back? Do you see what I mean? Something changed. Six months ago, those were classic smoke-and-mirror accounts. Double transactions, switchbacks... Now it's like Mary Poppins and Mother Teresa opened a retirement fund. - Clean as a whistle. - I thought... .. you weren't talking to me. Well, you did prosecute the serious fraud case - against the Liberian fund. - Are we going to talk about what happened? - We do not have to talk about what happened. - Andrew, my ex... Not everyone talks about everything that happens all the time. - Andrew and I are just friends. - Mm. - Occasionally, with benefits. - There it is. But not of late. I put a stop to that. I felt it was... - .. holding me back. - Holding you back from what? You should take it this time. It is actually ringing. You're so romantic. So, the girl, Lubica. You think she was running the old dirty accounts and the new clean ones? I think she was doing more than that. Skeltoft Farm Limited is no longer the holding company. It's a shell under a new owner. Skeltoft Assets. Well, who owns the goddamn farm? So, Lubica owns the bloody place? She is the majority shareholder in Skeltoft Assets. Which is the holding company for the whole business. - Muriel... - Not now, Sean. I'm talking to the Chief. So, what did Darren's kids have to say about it all? No, I don't think they know. Otherwise, we would have heard DJ screaming about it from here. Lubica... Wow! Muriel... I mean, it's such a classic move. Saddle a company with bad debt, run it into the ground, - then they're forced to sign it over to you. - Mm, and then you do them in. Poor Charlene. She trusted Lubica like a second mom. Mum? She's only three years older than Charlene. She's an arctic fox. She'd chew off her own leg to survive. - So, you think Lubica did it all on her own? - You don't think she did? You don't think she's smart enough? If you follow the money, it's the only answer. Yeah, and you follow the suitcase and you get an even better one. CCTV from Witham Bend. What am I looking at? Tomas Kovac in possession of a Maklov 1000 Wednesday last, 7:13am. The same suitcase I found Darren in. 'The suspect is Tomas Kovac. Heavy-set, hunky build. He should be approached with caution. They're still searching. Not a sign. - Do you want us to bring the dogs in? - Is this his? - Yes. - Right. He sent money to Slovenia. We all send money to our families. 15 grand? He's done a runner, hasn't he? Yeah. Dad wouldn't give up this company. He built it from nothing. - What was he thinking? - Thinking with his dick, as usual. That's my dad that you're talking about. Well, three months ago, he folded the previous corporate structure into a new entity. All assets controlled by Miss Varga. That was her plan all along. Get Dad, get in our house, get the lot. I'm calling the lawyer. I wouldn't. You've hundreds of thousands from this camp going through the books that are completely unexplained. I'm freezing your assets - until the proceeds of crime investigation's complete. - Serious? This is bullshit. DJ! - Does any of this makes sense to you? - Does what? Dad was killed. Tomas went missing. Tomas killed Dad. Were you aware of any kind of relationship - between Miss Varga and Tomas? - They were friends. He trained her. He trained me, too. - Are you trying to say...? - Were they training that night? - Did you see them maybe? - Lubica did all of the books. She... Charlene? I introduced her to Dad! Did I introduce Dad to the woman that killed him? Darren asked me to do the accounts. It was a better job than picking in frozen fields. You concealed financial crime. It was nothing to do with me. Darren was the boss. He had many unsavoury friends. Criminals, probably. Always out drinking, doing cocaine, whatever he felt like. I told him financial crime was for men smarter than him. He promised he'd stop. And he did. So, he closed the dirty company and opened the new one in your name. Signing the assets into my name was to protect his family and their home. Why not sign it over to his children? Cos he didn't want them to know the mess he'd made. Who was the bad money, Lubica? Who was he in bed with? There was much Darren kept from me. OK, do you really think I'd be back picking cabbages in the fricking rain if I had thousands stashed under my mattress? - What about Tomas Kovac? - What about Tomas Kovac? Tomas dumped the body. Tomas sent £15,000 home to his family. A down payment for killing Darren, was it? Tomas didn't kill anyone. He cries when he finds a dead dormouse in the field. Where is he, Lubica? Where's Tomas? Dad used to say that I was just like Mum. I only ever think of myself. Which is funny, really. Because I've never thought that much of myself. - Dads talk a lot of shit sometimes. - No. He was right. I've fucked up more than once. School, drink, drugs... Then there was this guy on the farm who gave me some attention. When I told Dad that I was pregnant... Well, you can imagine how that one went. How did you feel? I wasn't good enough to be a mum. Well, yeah. I mean, that's crazy. You were 14. He made me give her up. So, the baby was adopted. I couldn't look after myself. Dad said he was done with looking after feckless women's babies. He was upset about your mother leaving. No. He was right. I'm not good enough. I needed to show him that I could be his daughter. Be someone's mum. It's too late now. You're not going to do anything stupid, right? No. I'm not brave enough for that. When you, erm... .. took those pills... .. how did it feel? I don't know. I think I felt relieved. And alone? I could have helped you. Were you afraid to come to me? Did you think you'd let me down by sending that boy your photos? You down? I let Mom down. She never would have fallen for a stupid trick like that. I wanted her to yell at me. And she wasn't even around to do that. I'm sorry. Alex kissed me today. - What? - He said it was your idea. - I thought Alex was gay. - That's what I thought as well, Dad. Why does everyone always want something more? Things were fine the way they were. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I believe you wanted to speak to me. A night in the cell has focused your mind, has it? Yes. You are a very clever policewoman. Darren has a safe where he keeps his paperwork and stuff. Maybe in there you will find what you need. I'll show you. Whoa, whoa, whoa... What the fuck does she think she's doing here? - I thought she was locked up. - Right, she's helping us. A lot more than I can say for you two. I know you paid someone to find Tomas Kovac. Not to find him. To kill him. You're stupid enough to say that to a copper? Behind that. He always loved me in that mirror. There's no financial stuff in here. It's just old letters. They're written in Polish. More hate mail, probably. Jesus! Get her in that car. I want her out of here now. You're dead! You are fucking dead! - Charlene, stop it, calm down. - I'm going to kill her! - Calm down, Charlene. - Fucking dead! Fucking kill her! Requesting assistance. Critical incident at Skeltoft. Hey! Get down, now! Hey, hey! Stop. Stop it. I had to hide. They were going to kill me. Tomas Kovac... .. I'm arresting you for the murder of Darren Bailey. You argued with Darren. We've got you on his voicemail threatening to kill him. You're a man of your word. You went through with it. Or maybe it wasn't your fault at all. Maybe it wasn't your idea. I have nothing to say to you. How much do you earn through the camp? Let's take last month. £643.49p in your back pocket. Yet, you sent home 15 grand. Lubica paid you to kill Darren. Didn't she? You think I take money from a woman? - Don't go down for her. - I have nothing to say to you. Cobley! - ~ - What was that? What did you say to him? We've got cameras all with sound, so we're going to find out. I told him not to worry. Really? Because I'd be worried. - He did nothing. - Nothing? He was caught on camera dumping Darren Bailey's body. That's murder. Tomas didn't kill Darren. He just put him in the suitcase. How do you know that? Because I told him to. Are you sure you don't want someone else to do this, sir? Nonsense, Muriel. This is your case. You've got this, Yeardsley. Make us proud. Lubica Varga... .. I presume you're here to confess to the murder of Darren Bailey? No. No? No? I found him in our bedroom. Lying on the floor. His head broken. And you with a large, blunt object in your hand. I did not kill him. You just found him. So, why didn't you call the police? You have to ask? His body in my bedroom. You wouldn't have believed me. For some reason, I thought the authorities might do what they normally do, and blame the Slovenian gold-digging immigrant. Isn't this what the newspaper called me? You told Tomas to do a runner. I told him to go to the airport and never come back. Not to hide in the polytunnels. Did you pay him? No. I offered, actually. But he... - .. doesn't take money from women. - Doesn't take money from women. Yeah, I've heard. So, he risked life imprisonment... .. for a friend? Yes. It is also true that, one day, he'd like to be fucking me. Oh, I see... All-empowered Englishwoman looking up to your male boss for direction. Yes. Yes, I asked him to help me. Because I was physically unable to crack the bones of my dead lover, put him in the bag and then remove it from my bedroom. Tomas did it for me because he has passion for me. You've never felt this sort of passion, have you? That feeling deep in your groin that would make you do anything for her. Darren was a hard man to love. But I did. He was not afraid to get his hands dirty. You wouldn't find him watching TV talent shows and moisturising. It's just pathetic this country with its shit food and piss-water beer. Even the women, afraid to dress nice, in case someone looks at them. Then complaining when they don't. Where did Tomas get the money? Come on, £15,000. You tell people like me we're lazy, useless, go home. Well, maybe we will. See how you deal with that. Tomas Kovac sent 15 grand back home months ago. Yeah, you go, Muriel. Once you got Skeltoft under your name, you decided to have Darren killed. You planned this. You paid him. I did not pay him. If that wasn't payment for a murder, what was it for? Where did Tomas get the money, Lubica? We all got emails. Free money, it said. Some of us were stupid enough to believe it. All we had to do was let them use our bank details. They put thousands through our accounts and let us keep a few hundred each time. Layering. Layering? What's that, then? It's money laundered through thousands of private accounts. So, the little guys get popped and the big guys never do. Loads of people in the camp fell for it. There were new iPads. Canada Goose coats everywhere. It wasn't just the workers, though, was it? That's what you were trying to hide in the Skeltoft business accounts. Darren was letting them use the camp and all its workers to launder money. Like I said, I told him to stop. And when he did...? They didn't like it. Yeah, they killed him. Who are they, Lubica? She said he died at Skeltoft in their bedroom. Someone hit him. And we still don't have a weapon. Broadbent says there are no traces of fragments in his skull. She's still waiting on blood and tissue analysis. It makes sense. I mean, it's only a murder investigation. The story checks out. There's evidence of layering in a lot of the workers' accounts and your dad's books. Yeah, someone was using this place to money launder. And they didn't like it when he wanted to stop. So, the money men killed Dad? But you don't know who they are yet, do you? You're useless. This is where she said she found him, on his back, his head to the door. So, they came in behind him and hit him. The wound was at the top of the skull. It was a hard, downward motion. Darren's what, six feet tall? This ceiling's barely seven. I don't think they could get that kind of an angle. Somebody killed Darren Bailey. He was a piggy bank. They weren't going to let that go just because he wanted to go legit. Here it is. Darren tested positive for alcohol, cocaine... .. and cyanide? Cyanide? - He was poisoned? - But the head wound...? So, he fell and hit his head. But the fall didn't kill him. It was the poison. He must have hit something hard on the way down. Get forensics in here. He was poisoned. Hi, Val. Go and get the brothers. Poison's intimate. It's someone you're close with. Someone you're breaking bread with. You two are certainly chips off the old block. It's not ours. Charl was here last. Charlene's doing cocaine again? She hasn't touched the stuff since rehab. That's Dad's tin. His stash. Charlene used to score it for him. Charlene got coke for your dad? - Yeah. - Where did Charlene get the coke? Dad was picky with what he liked. Pure Siberian snow, he called it. Siberian snow? - Where is she? - I don't know. But I saw her run off. - Dad's car's not there. - Stupid cow. Why would she take the coke? Jesus Christ...! Charlene's been off drugs for years. Why now? - She needed the courage, I guess. - For what? Where are you going, sir? She could be anywhere. She's going to Oleg Krasnov's. He's laundering money through the camp. Charlene was the intermediary. I think she's going to try and kill him. She's just ahead, sir. She's nearly at Oleg's. Shit! - Charlene? - Call for paramedics. Possible cocaine overdose. 'Is she conscious and breathing? It's not cocaine, it's cyanide! Correction. It's cyanide. They poisoned your father's coke. Is that what you took? He told me that I could make Dad a tonne of money and that he'd be proud of me. Shh... Keep her talking, but make sure she keeps warm. I didn't mean to. I killed him. Shh... I killed my dad! No, you didn't. The man who laced his coke with cyanide did that. - Do you miss Queen Anne's? - Not remotely. - It was a bitch fest. - Thank God you made your escape. I ran away six times. You're already here. Sorry I'm late. How's, er...? How's everything? Good. It's given me a chance to find out some things. Such as how you encouraged... .. Kelsey's gay boyfriend to make a move on her. Well, that is a very rough synopsis. I knew Dad was involved when Alex used the phrase "minimal risk". Oh...! OK, we're going to need some wine. ♪ Travelling north Travelling north to find you ♪ The train was beating the wind In my eyes ♪ Don't even know what I'll say When I find you ♪ I'll call out your name, love Don't be surprised... ♪ "Anna is 12 now. "She loves volleyball and Ariana Grande. "She's a happy girl and loves her life here. "She would love to see her mum, if her mum is interested." The letters were written in Polish. It took me a while to work out what they were. Do you know he put her up for adoption? He wouldn't tell me where. He just told me to sign the papers. I wanted to find her, but... .. Dad told me that they didn't want to hear from me. They were in your dad's safe. He kept them all. Can you read it to me again, please? The last one. Yeah. Erm... "Dear Anna's mum, we hope you are getting our letters. "Anna is growing up so fast and she often asks about her birth mother. "We tell her we are sure you also think of her. "One day, we hope you will both be able to meet." Thank you. What about him, the Russian? - Do you have enough to arrest him? - No. He kept to himself, removed from all those details. But trust me, I'm not letting go of this. I've got a lot to answer for, haven't I? - It's like Dad said, I... - No, I'm sorry, but your dad was wrong. And you have a daughter out there that needs you to see that. Are you staying? - DJ and I came to an arrangement. - Hm. They need someone who knows how to run this place. I see someone's fixed the dryers. Someone took out the coin slots. It's good business. Incentivised workers work harder. I also fixed the hot tub. What about Tomas? Is he staying? He has big arms. And I like men with big arms. Another marriage of convenience. Well, then, everybody's happy. Yeah. Including the man who murdered Darren Bailey. I wasn't expecting you, Bill. Sorry about that. Next time, my aim will be better.
