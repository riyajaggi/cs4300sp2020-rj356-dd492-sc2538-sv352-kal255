 'It's of great concern that the Government hasn't organised our public services to cope with all the Eastern Europeans who are entering the UK. What do you say we get a take-out tonight and watch The Bachelor, like we never left home? Are you OK? Are you nervous about something? I'm not nervous. Changing schools is the only constant in my life. What's that? What's going on? Ey up, sir.

 An early morning walker found a dead body by the woods, sir. Shit! - Sorry, young lady. - It's OK. Shit! Jesus!...! What the hell do you think you're doing? - Police. There's been an incident. - What sort of incident? I don't care if you found a Bigfoot. It's the only road into town. No, it isn't. You go back that way past the bricklayer's and you get back on the A52. - I need you to go back inside. - I'm not going anywhere. - I can understand that... - Get the fuck... Out of my way, I'm late. Give me your radio.

 A possible obstruction situation, PC Cobley. Requesting assistance. Over. Yeah, you and me both. Sod it. Let him through. We're all bets it was a kid now, anyway. A kid? I once saw a dog stick his head out of a sunroof going under a bridge. Messy business. But this lad, there's no... spatter. So, he was killed somewhere else, - then brought here to Dead Man's Wood? - Someone has a sense of humour. Well, the walker that found him weren't laughing. Is there anything else you can tell me? Nothing for the moment. Let's get him out of this, see if we can't find out who he is. - It might take a while. - Why, because his face is smashed in? Well, that. And the fact that someone's taken the trouble to burn off his fingerprints. And here it is. Boston Pilgrims Comprehensive. It doesn't look too bad. Some interesting graffiti. "Real eyes realise..." "real lies." I don't see it. - Where...? - It's over there. Next to the thumbs up. That's a penis, Dad. Terrific. Can you drop me off round the corner? I don't want people to see this car. Sure. Morning. She was only in the force ten months. With zero arrests. And complaints from the public. She didn't read a dealer his rights right. She needs time, is all. Lydia... it's the law of the jungle. And a piece of advice, never get too attached. It makes it easier to say goodbye. Planning on nailing someone up on that, or is that just for personal use? No. No, I'm... I'm making it for the chapel. I help out. You know, I sweep up, I sing, I do readings, whatever they need. Ray Gilchrist is the name. Sean Cobley. I don't sing. I've been asked not to. So, you own all of this, then, do you? No, the Lord has blessed me with stewardship of parts of it. But when the sun shines, though, it's a nice spot for a picnic. Yeah, there was a body found in the woods. I don't suppose you were picnicking last night, were you? No. Dead Man's Wood. In the dark, it's for... braver men than me. Or women. Right. Any woman in particular? Hey, it's a proper bit of kit, that. I wouldn't have thought you'd be able to test the soil without sticking something in the ground first. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa... I'm a police officer. - Says you. - Yeah, I was here before. DC Muriel Yeardsley. Yeardsley? Scrane End? - You know our lot, do you? - Aye. I heard a load of lads are running that farm now. - Running it into the ground. - We're not as technologically advanced as this place, that's for sure. Erm, the body that was found on your land, I want to ask you a few questions. It wasn't found on my land. It was found in the woods between my property and theirs. It's Ray Gilchrist you should be talking to. His farm's on the other side of the wood. Yeah, well, why do you say that? Because some people don't care who they hurt. Never did. Audrey Merrick. Lisa Cranston, Boston Stump. Not now, Lisa, right? Audrey is... Audrey now, is it? Don't take any notice of her. She's leaving. Hey, I'm sorry, I just... I just thought you wouldn't want to talk to the press. Then, why would I have called them? And unlike you lot, when you do call them, they actually turn up. I'd just as well be left alone now. Eight burglaries. I've had eight in two years. And what have the police done? Fuck... Rural crime costs 2.1 million a year. At least, according to my campaign leaflet, it does. I pledged to help people like her. And now here she is, eight burglaries in a year. Four. It's eight over two years. Right. And what about the dead lad? He has all the hallmarks of a gang hit. Fingerprints burnt off, face beaten to a pulp. And she's tricky, so I hear. And thanks to this, she's got a real following with the "string them up" brigade. And they are hard to placate. You know, unless you actually start executing people. I think she'd benefit from a visit. Get her on side and then we can start to spin this thing in my favour, hey? Show her the Hixon charm, Bill. It worked on me. I'd just as well be left alone now. Eight burglaries. I've had eight in two years. And what have the police done? Fuck all! I've had so much stuff nicked, I've had to put security all over my farm. Mrs Merrick? Hi. I'd like to... Careful. That's electric. Excuse me! Let's try this again. - Mrs Merrick... - Miss. Miss Merrick... I'm Chief Constable Bill Hixon. I heard about your eight burglaries. No flies on you. You only reported two of them. We can't solve crimes we don't know about. You can't solve crimes you do know about. Well, I'd like to look at your property. Maybe I can help you secure it. See how they got in. Help yourself. You park your mobile on a drainage point. In two more minutes, you're going to need a tow truck. Hixon. - Sir? - Hello? - Sir? - Who is that? - It's Muriel. - Who? Muriel. The DNA has come back on the body from the woods. It's a local Boston boy. William Mobury. He served 18 months for persistent breaking and entering on mostly isolated farms. As for the gangland theory, he's no known affiliations, no-one from serious and organised knows him. So, it doesn't seem like a gang thing. You'll have to excuse me, Muriel, but my life has reached such a nadir of awfulness that I cannot tell you who or where I am. I see, sir. Good luck with that. Before you go, I do need to speak... Rude. - What's that? - That's a lovely cup of coffee for you, love. I only drink tea. I know how you feel, Miss Merrick. Will Mobury invaded your home, he made you feel like a victim. Now, our farm's been done a couple of times now. It's scary. Are you looking for a hug? How did it happen? He come after you, you fought him back with the shovel? Yeah, no-one around these parts would blame you for it. Nobody from around these parts is. Right, Audrey... Come on, back at me. Audrey! I'm just saying, someone shows up at the house at the crack of night. I'm there, a woman on my own... I'd be waiting for them. Ten of them show up, I'd kill them, too. Right, I'm off. Where are you going? It looks like we've got a murder weapon off your farm. I think you'd better sit back down. If there's anything you want to say to me right now, it'd be very helpful for you going forward, particularly if it involves some regret. There is one thing. - I'm going to need a lift home. - Sir... It's pig's blood. The... - The blood on the shovel, it's pig's. - The runt was sick. One bang. Over. Cheaper than the vet's. You could have told me that it wasn't human blood. You're not the sort that listens. You're the sort that learns. You shouldn't be poking around in my life. If you're looking for a killer, you need to be looking one place only. The Gilchrists'. So, who the hell are the Gilchrists? Ray Gilchrist. It turns out Ray has got a record. He did two years for ABH, cautioned for other violent offences. His farm's just on the other side of Dead Man's Wood. - So, I reckon there's a finger pointing at him. - Yeah. Audrey's. A piece of work. She's smart. She's talking to The Stump, getting them all riled up. Now everybody's paying attention to us. But trust me, - someone who's working it that hard is guilty. - So...? So, why are we looking where Audrey Merrick wants us to look? I'm not! I'm following the evidence. - Where are you off? - Following the real evidence. I'm sorry. Hey, Muriel, I've got the lad's next-of-kin. She was the last person he called. Her name's Freya Mobury. Go on, what are you waiting for? - Go on. - Thank you! Magda always packs too much. - Here, have one. - Thanks. So, I read the court records you sent over. It's a farmers' feud. These two families have been going at each other for generations. The Gilchrists and the Merricks. They've clogged up court schedules for years. In 1982 alone, there were 13 suits and counter suits. 1982... Nebraska. Springsteen's best. - He never toured it. - What a shame. With farmers, it's never about what's on the surface, it's about bad blood in the soil. Unless you're one of them, you will never be able to handle them. I'll be able to handle them. Is that right, city boy? Without gold-plated evidence, these people will run rings around you. First of all, I'm not a city boy. And... we really don't know each other that well, do we? Well... This was nice. Next time at yours? Erm... Yeah, Kelsey doesn't really know about us. I meant your office. Yeah. I talked to her on the telephone, you know? Kelsey? We had a scintillating conversation. How did it go? "Hello? Is Bill Hixon at home?" "No. He's trying to break the bicycling record" "for the Herne Loop." I think she knows. Don't you? Look, look, luck. Here comes bugeyes. She looks like a nun! Her face is hilarious. Watch this... Bitch. - You just got violated! - It's not funny. Don't let them find out who your dad is. - I saw you get dropped around the back. - So... where are the rest of you? Where I come from, the geeks are the biggest clique in the school. - After the jocks. - I am a jock. - Yeah, right. - Check this out. I practise bokator. It's a Cambodian martial art. Who's the dude? Did he move away or something? Or something. Freya Mobury, sister of William? Bollocks... What's he done? And the last phone call Will made was to you. What did he say? Erm... I thought he was at some rave. He was shouting about sparks in the sky, the fireworks. I hung up on him. I... - I'd like to know, Freya. - I thought he was tripping. If I had a pound for every time Will called me off his tits, I'd have had enough to get me and Scott out of here for good. - Scott? - Yeah. He's our kid brother. He's a good boy. Easily led. Especially by Will. And can we speak to Scott? Yeah. Sure. He's not been answering my calls, but... God... Hey. Hey. Come on, let's go. It's cold. - Alex is going to come home with us. - OK, where is she? He's across the street. Erm... listen, why don't you and I just spend a little time together, have a quiet dinner? He's gay. Come on over, buddy! What is it? Erm, it's a missing persons, sir. Scott Mobury. You guys, why don't you go inside, OK? Mobury? Didn't we find him already? Scott Mobury, Will's younger brother. No police record. He's only 17. Some kid was found this morning with his skull caved in. Let's go. Kids, go inside. - I won't be long. - Alex...? Alex, what's wrong? Freya said Will was robbing farms. She was worried he was using his brother to help him. This is it, sir. Dead Man's Wood. Maybe Scott was here with Will. - Could Scott have killed his brother? - His sister says no way. I believe her. Scott followed Will around like a lost puppy. He worshipped him. Followed him right into all this shit. I think we're looking for another body. We need to talk to Audrey Merrick. And Ray Gilchrist. - Hey! - Jesus... - You need to leave. - Worried we're going to find something? You'll be finding you in a minute. I'm set to muck spread here. - Is that someone's mother? - Someone's sister. Ma'am, I found this. It's clean. It's been dropped recently. The stone's missing. Is that yours? Do I look like I wear rings? See the way she just looked at her? Well, if the ring isn't Audrey's, maybe it's the Gilchrists'? That road leads to their house. Sorry, we tried knocking. - It's beautiful music. - He has a lovely voice. He gets it from his old man, of course. The name's Albert. And this is my Ray of sunshine. We've already spoken to the police. I've prayed for the lad who died. He is in the Lord's arms this morn. Can you take a look at these for me? - Two? - Scott. He's only a boy. He's 17. The dead lad's little brother. 17's not a boy. I saw my first tour of duty at that age. - Are you a veteran, sir? - Two Para. I fought at Goose Green. The Falklands. It's a lot like this place. Bare, muddy terrain. And thousands of miles from civilisation. I'll get you some biscuits. Thank you. Crack out the special rations, officer, for the mess. I know I've had some troubles in my past, but I've atoned. The past tends to repeat itself, Ray. You've got anger management issues. "The anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God." When I feel that anger... those words of James calm me every time. Every time? They should prescribe that on the NHS. What about the anger of Audrey Merrick, Ray? I don't see that there's a Bible verse about that one. Maybe Matthew 6:19. "Do not store up for yourself..." "the treasures of Earth where thieves break in and steal." I'm American. In God we trust. Do you recognise this? No, sorry. I wish I could help. I think you can. I... We're done here. Thank you, Mr Gilchrist. Did you see his face when I teased him about his versifying? Ray's temper's gone nowhere. - Audrey has a temper. - And yet no history of assault. She has no record of assault. Whatever history she has is very deep. We've got a trace on Scott's phone. It's on the move. It's 14 miles from here, near Stickney. He's stopped up here. 200 yards. Take a look inside. All clear. Hey! That's our car! They said they stopped at Stickney Services for petrol. Used the power wash to clean the tent. Left the boot open. Someone must have chucked the phone in. Yeah, to get us headed in the wrong direction. Make us think Scott was on his way across the North Sea. Mrs Merrick does like a little bit of misdirection, doesn't she? Or Ray. - What have you got on the phone, anything? - The tech boys found this. Deleted message meant for his sister. I can't tell when he wrote it. It never got sent. And unfinished. "I wish I had listened when you..." Kelsey! Dinner! I found Mexican take-out! Kels? Kelsey! Kelsey? Kelsey! So, you and Scott were close? Scott stood up for me when nobody else would. Thanks for coming. I couldn't just sit at home knowing that he... Yeah, it's fine. I get it. Erm, listen, Alex, usually when the police do a search like that, it generally means... Dead Man's Wood. I get it. What's that? They're burning something. Scott? Scott! Are you there? Wait! - Scott! Scott! - Alex, come back! - Scott, where are you? - Alex! Shit! Kelsey! - Jesus Christ! - Alex! Where's Alex? What's going on? There's no-one there. Just burning rubbish. - Scott's not there. - What are you talking about? Scott said he was working on a farm near Dead Man's Wood. Scott? You mean Scott Mobury? He's my friend. He told me he was working near here with his brother Will. Where's my phone? - I want my mum. - All right. I'll call your mum. Come on, I don't have her number. Yes, you do. Jesus, Alex. Why didn't you tell me it was your Scott? Look, I didn't put two and two together. I went up to her room and she was gone. Yeah, taking my son out in the middle of the night. - Excuse me? - Alex is vulnerable. My daughter is 14 years old, American and in her first week at a new school. And lost her mother. You want to talk to me about vulnerable? I was worried. I didn't know you had a son that old. Yeah, well, we start young in these parts. Fast learners. This isn't a good friendship. - We shouldn't encourage them. - Yeah, no argument there. You're grounded. That is the single least effective punishment you could give me. - I'm always grounded, Dad. - Kelsey... Maybe you like keeping your distance from people. But I don't. Tonight was not the smartest move, and I get that. - It was dangerous. - Alex needed to find his friend. That's what people do for people they care about. Well, hello, Alex's mom. What joyous revelation do you have for me today? So, that's another four good cops off the street. I suppose you get a bonus per redundancy. Do you think your son knows what farm Scott worked on? No. I think I have a pretty good idea. Can you imagine fighting off two young guys single-handedly? She's something else. I mean, have you seen what Will Mobury looked like? - You don't know that Audrey killed anybody. - That's just the thing. I do. I see it in her. - You like her, don't you? - What? A bit of advice, don't get attached. - Did she say that? - Jesus, they're your words, not Audrey's. Why do you bother with these redundancy procedures? Just grab a shovel and dispatched the runts one by one! You and her firing off rounds at anyone who dares come near your little island. Of course you know what she's capable of. You are her. That explains the bangs. Whose clothes are you burning, Audrey? What are you two up to? Back issues of The Stump. "Ray Gilchrist cautioned by police" "for fighting one of his own farm workers." Blah, blah, blah. Lydia's lad said young Scott worked on the farm. Yeah, he didn't say which farm, though, did he? - He didn't need to. - Click that photo. No, that's the wrong Gilchrist. That's Albert. Ray's dad. - He did all right, didn't he? - Shut your mouth! What? That's the ring from the field. It had a stone in it then. But that's the same ring. Where's His Lordship? I don't know. I don't care. Guess which farm the Moburys worked for. Ray Gilchrist hires ex-offenders. Get in there, you beauty! Jesus, well, bad blood all over, isn't it, lads? Jesus! Can I help you? I'm Chief Constable Bill Hixon. Anthony Stone. I run the five parishes. - I'm just a little bit jumpy today. - That's all right, I don't blame you. I saw who just came out of your church. I see the Merricks and the Gilchrists are all over this place. - What did Miss Merrick have to say for herself? - The late Reverend Stone said this used to be mutual ground for both families. But not so much any more. Apart from Ray Gilchrist, that is. That's one of Ray's, actually. My old parish used to buy me ciggies. This place would be dust without Ray. 1982. The year of the feud. He prepares the service sheets. He tends to the churchyard. He even fixed a pew that... In September 4th, there's a double booking for Gilchrist and Merrick. I thought they hated each other. But this looks like a wedding. It's private business. What did Audrey want? She came to talk about absolution. I'll bet she did. She wanted to know if God still loved those with murder in their hearts. Burning trash at night. Is that legal? Is trespassing? I know about you and Ray. He gave you his mother's ring, didn't he? We found it in the field. I know you were gonna get married, I've seen the church records. September 4th, 1982. Gilchrist... Merrick. What did he do, stand you up? Stand me up? - Are you joking? - That's where the ring came from. The one he gave you. Ray's mother's ring. The Moburys robbed you that night. You walked in on it. You hit Will with a shovel. Did you do the same thing to Scott? Where did you bury him? His sister would like to know. I've got a field to plough. You need to go. Look, you lied to us, Ray. You hire criminals. I hire people who need a second chance! It's more than her over the field would do. What's wrong with basic tools? Digging your hands in the turf, like God intended. - Biscuits! - Will and Scott Mobury, they didn't appreciate their second chance, did they? Robbed their Good Samaritan blind, right? You caught them, didn't you, Ray? Right, I mean, still, that kind of betrayal must have stung. There's nowt to rob here! Unlike her place. Come on, Ray, now it's time to start talking to me. Before I come back with forensics and a search warrant. Dad! Dad, don't! Dad, don't, you'll cut yourself. Just sit down. Just sit down, OK? Do you know what? Just get out. You, go and get your warrant. Just get your warrant. Cos you're not coming back through these doors without one. - All right, just let me... - Get out! Get out! Dad, Dad, Dad, don't. No, it's OK, don't worry. The ring. It's Audrey's. That puts Mobury on her property. I guess Scott's body's somewhere here, too. We'll get a search warrant, we'll... Argh...! - Jesus! - Is that what burnt his fingers? I doubt it. Come on... We're going to follow their route that night. Where did they go? How did they get in? They saw Audrey heading out. We need to do this fast. Are those cables wired to the mains? That'd give you a shock. Did Freya say Will called saying something about seeing sparks? I don't know why more thieves don't invest in these. But it'll do. Jesus... This hatch was wired up. Plenty to steal here. Shit! Jesus! Jesus Christ! Scott! What has she done to you? Scott! Can you hear me? - Can you hear me? - Don't touch him! Stop! You've done enough. I thought you'd killed him. I tried to. I thought I'd killed both of them. I wired up those bars. I wanted to kill them. - I was sick of being robbed. - What about his brother? She didn't touch him. Will left me. I fell, but... He just grabbed the stuff and ran. We climbed up to the window, we both got shocked. I fell. He just went on in and took what he could. He left me for dead. It's all right, Scott. It's all right now. Hey, it's all right, my boy. It's all right. The last I saw of the other lad, he was running back towards the Gilchrist place. You can look, but you can't touch, Muriel. They won't grant a search warrant. Look at him. He's working up a right head of steam. Look, sooner or later, he'll give me probable cause. It's the boss. He's waiting for me over there. What, are you going over there when there's a murderer to be caught here? Didn't you hear me, Muriel? He's my boss. I'm not going to give him probable cause to fire by arse. Yeah, yeah, I got your message, sir. I'm on my way back. No ambulance. They'll send him to young offenders. And that's why I couldn't tell you. You didn't kill Will, but you think... Ray did. You were going to marry him. More fool me. My dad told me. That lot just wanted to put all our land into the Gilchrists' name. Tax efficient, they said. Ray never wanted me. You loved him. He was beautiful once. I watched him the whole way crossing the land. And he had flowers in his hand. And he asked to go walking... with me. And we were going to be married. Until his daddy came home. The big injured war hero. But I never saw no injury. Whatever it was, it was in his head. I saw Ray, though. And whatever Albert said, he jumped. So much for love. What the hell have you got in there? It's OK, Drakes. I've found Scott Mobury. You can call off the search. He's...? What happened to him? He's all right. He's going to be OK. Unlike his brother. So, did Ray do it, sir? The sparks. The fireworks. That pylon blew. Where's Yeardsley? I know who killed Will Mobury. Yes! That's evidence, Ray. Put it down! Put it down! Please, you don't understand. Ray Gilchrist, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murdering Will... No! No, Dad! Argh! Dad! No! No! - Sargent Gilchrist! - It's all right, sir, I've got this. You were at Goose Green, weren't you? - 14 hours under bombardment. - All for fuck all. You saw the lights, the explosions over there. The lights in the sky coming from the Merricks' farm. One of them Argies coming right for me. For my farm. You weren't going to let that happen. Stand down, Sargent! There's no Argentinian fighters here. The explosions were the pylons blowing. Those two aren't the enemy. Stand down, soldier. You're just like all the other officers. You're fucking... No! No, Dad! Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad! No, no, no! It's over. No, no... It's all over. No... No. No, Dad. Yeardsley, are you OK? Shut up! It'll be all right, Dad. It'll be all right. Come on. - Watch your head. - Look after him, won't you? We'll call you from the hospital. You can come down after and see him then, all right? I didn't know. After you showed me the pictures of those boys, he said one of them looked like a soldier he'd... he'd killed in the Falklands. So... And then, when I found the shovel, then I knew. I knew. Ray... Hey. Erm... I thought we left it in kind of a weird place. Not at all. You were looking out for your daughter. It's your job. She's all I've got. But she doesn't have to be. Andrew is... my ex-husband. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. Goodnight. Wait, Bill... We're not going in? Your friends seemed kind of... She wasn't hungry.
