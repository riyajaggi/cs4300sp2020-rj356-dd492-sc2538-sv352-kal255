 Battlestar Galactica (2004â€“2009): Season 1, Episode 13 - Kobol's Last Gleaming: Part 2 - full transcript 
 Commander Adama is not amused when he finds out president Roslin convinced Starbuck to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo. He orders an attack on Colonial One to end her reign. To retrieve the Raptor away team crashed on the surface of Kobol, he sends Boomer and Racetrack. They're supposed to nuke the Cylon Basestar in a Raptor with a Cylon transponder. While Starbuck is approaching Caprica, Boomer mentions to Helo they're at the temple of Delphi. Somehow she seems to know the importance of the arrow of Apollo. She tells Helo their relationship is important and that she actually has feelings for him. To Dr. Baltar on the surface of Kobol it becomes clear why his Number Six wanted him there. She has some explaining to do.

 CRASHDOWN: Come on, move! Out! Come on, get him out of the chair. Drag him out. TYROL: Look at me. l got him ! CRASHDOWN: For gods' sakes, hurry! TYROL: Come on ! l got his legs. l got him ! Try it on your shoulder. (SCREAMS) CRASHDOWN: Doc! Come on, Doc! Crash ! Doc! Crash ! Doc! Take my hand. Gaius, take my hand. Hey, come on ! Wake up! Stay with me! We gotta go! Stay with me, Doc! Come on ! CALLY: Come on ! Bring him outside! lt's gonna blow! Get down ! Stay down. You okay? TYROL: We got full tanks. Let's see what we get. Getting them down. CALLY: You all right? You okay? TYROL: Get the supplies before they burn up. Go. CALLY: Right away. We crashed both tanks. The gas is gone. lt's all gone. (THEME MUSlC) lt's a museum. So what? lt's more than that. lt's the home of the arrow of Apollo. What the hell is that? You never liked history. Come on, Helo. lt's supposed to be the only clue as to the location of Earth. Earth? What are you talking about? Who's going to Earth? lt doesn't even exist. l'm trying to get back to Galactica. What l need from you is a way off this planet, and a way back to my ship. lf you don't do that, l'll blow your head off. Why don't you just shut up for a change? You're only alive because l've kept you alive. lf it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now. Whether you like it or not, l'm your only hope of getting off this planet. So if l were you, l'd take that tough guy attitude of yours and shove it up your ass. We can't move around the city during daylight. So we hole up and we wait till dark. (WlND HOWLlNG) Unbelievable. She's crossed the line before, but this is so far beyond the pale. . . She wouldn't have done this on her own. She was coerced. No one coerces Starbuck. Believe me, l've tried. Commander, l have the President on the line. Bear witness. Put on your headset. ADAMA: Madam President, moments ago, Lieutenant Thrace took the Cylon Raider on an unscheduled and unauthorized jump. Yes. Do you have any knowledge of this incident? Let's save some time here, Commander. The question you really want to ask me, is whether or not l asked Lieutenant Thrace to take the Raider to Caprica. The answer to your question is, yes. You and l had talked about this. Yes, we had. ADAMA: We both decided it was a miIitary decision. My responsibility as President is first and foremost to protect and preserve this fleet and its future. ln the end, that outweighs any other consideration. lt has to. By taking the Raider, you've placed our people on the surface of Kobol in direct danger. l'm very aware of the danger our men and women are in on Kobol. l am also deeply aware of the danger this civilization will be in if l ignore the pursuit of this arrow. l'm going to have to ask you for your resignation, Madam President. ROSLlN: No. Then l'm terminating your presidency as of this moment. Commander Adama, l will exercise the authority of this office until l am unable to do so. So if you want to stage a coup, you're gonna have to come over here and arrest me. l don't want any bloodshed. Of course you don't. Neither do l. Neither does the press. They're here, by the way. The press. They're recording every minute. Order the Cap to isolate Colonial One. Mr. Gaeta. Sir. Jam any transmissions in or out of Colonial One immediately. Yes, sir. Prepare a strike team. As long as she's President, she's dangerous. lf she can turn Starbuck against us, she's capable of anything. Yes, sir. She's bluffing. Well, let's hope so. There's also a Cylon base ship out there to deal with. Leave that to me. This government survived a Cylon attack. lt will survive William Adama. l think he's bluffing. But just in case, we need to be prepared. l know their security detail. They will defend that ship. We'll have to take her down compartment by compartment. Mr. Gaeta? Sir. Am l correct in assuming that l have two Cylon transponders left? Yes, sir. But only one of them is fully functional. One will do. Now l need a pilot. Sir. As you were. How are you feeling? lt looks worse than it is, sir. Things are moving very quickly and l need every pilot. l'm ready, sir. l have a very special mission for you and l won't kid around. lt's high risk, extremely high risk. l understand. l need you to light-jump to Kobol and take care of this Basestar. We're placing a Cylon transponder aboard your Raptor. ln theory, it should allow you to approach the Basestar without getting fired upon. But we'll still be lD'd as Colonial Raptors once we're in visual range. For all they know, you could be two Cylon agents returning with a captured Raptor. Once you're inside the defense perimeter l need you to make them think you want to dock. You have to fire your nuke into the loading bay and then jump back home immediately. Do you understand? l understand. l can do it, sir. l know l can. You have to. Yes, sir. (SlGHS) (MOANS) This doesn't look good. Please tell me this was not all for nothing. l'm good. l am really good. (LAUGHS) l'm home. Wow, l'm home. (CONTROL BEEPlNG) Gaeta, please tell me that you're right about this transponder thing. Stop. Stop that. l'm nervous. (SlGHS) Like anything scares you. Things scare me, Helo. l have feelings. You have software. l don't know if you can hear this or not, Helo, but what we had between us was important. lt was very important. Why? Because it was the next step. Because it brings us closer to God. Don't mock the gods. lt's a human belief. l'm human. They're our gods. But beyond that, l just want you to know that l genuinely feel something for you. l don't care. l don't love you. l loved what l thought was you. Helo, l think there's something else that you should know. l'm pregnant. APOLLO: Galactica, Apollo. We have visual lD on Colonial One. Tell Apollo he's cleared to begin the assault to contact us when he has soft-seal on the hull. Aye, sir. Commander, Boomer and Racetrack are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol. Put them through down here. Boomer, Galactica Actual. I just wanted to say good Iuck, good hunting and I have compIete faith in the both of you. Thank you, ActuaI. We won't Iet you down. Racetrack, start the jump cIock. (CONTROL BEEPlNG) Clock is running. APOLLO: Galactica. Apollo. We have soft-seal. l know Commander Adama and l'm counting on the fact that when push comes to shove, he is the kind of man who will not want bloodshed. Nevertheless, this may not be the safest place. Billy, how many civilians are in the cargo hold? 1 76. There is room in the cargo hold and l implore you to find refuge there with the other civilians. This is my choice. This is my choice. You do not have to come with me. We stand with our President. (PHONE BEEPS) Yes? Right. Security commander reports sounds of someone cutting through the hull. The Raptors are cutting through the hull, sir. Get the President on the line. (WlND HOWLlNG) You think this thing is working? (CONTROL BEEPlNG) We're about to find out. (BEEPlNG CONTlNUES) (BOTH BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) (SlGHS) I guess so. Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) How are we doing on that? lt's not responding, sir. Are you even trained to use this thing? How's he doing, Chief? (SlGHS) Not doing so good. l don't know if his lungs are burned or what. He's a tough kid. He's gonna pull through. Get those wounds looked at, Chief. TYROL: Yeah. Lieutenant? Shouldn't we be moving out? You have a plan for tactical deployment? Plan for tactical deployment, Chief? Get to the high ground. lt'll be our best chance of being seen by a search party. High ground is also our best chance of being seen by the Cylons. They're flying around, sir. They might land the troops before we get rescued. That's true. Yeah. Sir, if l may suggest that we take cover on the ground, maybe somewhere we won't be seen from the air? Okay, yeah. Chief, that's. . . (SlGHS) Carry on, Chief. Launch the nuke and prepare to jump. (CONTROL BEEPlNG) Frak. What? The bomb reIease is jammed. l can't free it. ALARM BUZZlNG) (GRUNTS) We can dock inside the ship. Excuse me? They think we're Cylons. They'II Iet us dock. We can release the bomb manuaIIy and drop the nuke inside the ship itseIf. lt'll work. l know it. Oh, my gods. Petard, Felix? Can l get a hand up here, please? Yes, sir. Cally, how's he doing? Not good, sir. TYROL: Get a blanket on him. Keep him warm. NO. 6: How are you? BALTAR: Alive. You saved me. You saved my life. Care to return the favor? Are you in need of saving? You wondered why you were chosen? Why God chose you above all other humans to survive and serve his purpose? Now is the time to find out why. Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer. Bring us out of the darkness and into the light. Give us the strength to show mercy to those who are merciless. . . The President says she will not yield. ELOSHA: . . .hearts that they may find peace. The President says she will not yield. So be it. (WHlSPERlNG) Come on, Dee, tell me he's not actually gonna do this. Tell me she's not gonna make him do it. Redeem our hearts that they may find peace in the midst of war. (CLANGlNG) What's going on? They're in. ROSLlN: Quickly. Billy? Sir, they're in. Pretty, isn't it? (GRUNTS) Hello, Lieutenant. Something l can help you with? I'm setting her down. (THUDDlNG) Open the hatch. BOOMER: l'll release the bomb. Keep the engines warm and ready for takeoff the second I get back. Yes, sir. Close the hatch after me. lf l'm not back in five minutes, just go. You got it. (HATCH CLOSES) (BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) Oh, my God. (BEEPlNG) NO. 6: Welcome back to Caprica, Lieutenant. Like what we've done with the place? (GRUNTlNG) (GROANlNG) (BEEPlNG) WOMAN: Sharon. The frak are you doing? Where are you going? Son of a bitch. (BREATHlNG HARD) Okay. (ECHOlNG) Sharon. This isn't happening. Come on, Starbuck. (GRUNTlNG) Got anything left? (SCREAMlNG) Starbuck? Madam President, no one needs to get hurt here. Then why don't you get off my ship, Colonel? l'm placing you under arrest. No. We're not doing this. l'm in command here, Captain. Colonel, this is wrong. You're relieved. Fall back. Madam President, l wish to. . . Men, lay down your weapons. TlGH: Have you lost your frakking mind? Colonel, tell these Marines to fall back. This is mutiny. You know that. Yes, l do. But you can tell my father l'm listening to my instincts. And my instincts tell me we cannot sacrifice our democracy just because the President makes a bad decision. Put your guns down. Madam President, stand back. Put your gun down, Captain. l will not have bloodshed, neither your men nor my people on the Colonial One. Put your gun down. All of you. Please, put your gun down. Let's go. MARlNE: Let's go, Captain. Let's go. You're confused. And scared. But it's okay. l'm not a Cylon. l'm Sharon Valerii. l was born on Troy. My parents were Katherine and Abraham Valerii. You can't fight destiny, Sharon. lt catches up with you. No matter what you do. Don't worry about us. We'll see you again. We love you, Sharon. And we always will. (BANGlNG) Boomer! Come on, let's go! What took you so Iong? Go! Where's your heImet? Close the hatch. Don't turn around. (BEEPlNG) He put his weapon right to my head. Said to tell you he was following his instincts whatever the hell that means. Bring him here. TlGH: What about Roslin? We put her in the brig. GAETA: Dradis contacts! lt's Boomer and Racetrack, sir. Put them on the speakers. BOOMER: Galactica, Boomer. Mission accompIished. Repeat, mission accompIished. The Basestar is history! ALL CHEERlNG) There's some good news. Bring them home, Dee. lt's great to hear your voice, Boomer. Come on home. (GROANlNG) HELO: lt's okay. l can't believe it.

She's pregnant. (BREATHlNG HARD) (SCREAMS) No! (CRYlNG) l know this place. Of course you do. Go inside. l don't understand. Life has a melody, Gaius. A rhythm of notes that become your existence once they're played in harmony with God's plan. lt's time to do your part and realize your destiny. Which is what, exactly? You are the guardian and protector of the new generation of God's children. The first member of our family will be with us soon, Gaius. lt's time to make your choice. But l don't understand what you're talking about. Really, l don't understand. Come. See the face of the shape of things to come. lsn't she beautiful, Gaius? (SlGHS) Open the cell. Close cell. Well done, Lieutenant. Thanks. Hey, nice work. Thanks. What's going on? A lot happened while you were gone. Congrats. Thanks. Congratulations to both of you. You carried out a very difficult and dangerous mission and you did it despite any personal misgivings you may or may not have had. And for that, l'm very proud. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
