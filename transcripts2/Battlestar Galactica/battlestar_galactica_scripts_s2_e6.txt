 Previously on Battlestar Galactica. Deep down in that thing you call a subconscious... you know how many Cylons there are left in the fleet. Eight! There are eight! Cpl. Venner reports the former President's missing. Missing? Two men down, cell's empty. Damn it. Glad to see you, Madam President. Well, Mr. Zarek. It would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Go find her. Let's go home.

 We have found Kobol. And when we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the Tomb of Athena... and we will find the road to Earth. No one's gonna believe this crap. And anyone that wants to make a suicide run to Kobol, let them. Astral Queen has jumped away. Twenty-four ships, sir. That's almost a third of the fleet. They're gonna follow Roslin to Kobol to their death. 18,000 souls aboard the 24 ships... that joined former President Roslin's rebellion, sir. That's over a third of the people in the fleet. Give me a breakdown. What have we lost? 9,500 souls from Geminon, 6,250 from Caprica.

 Not who. What. I'm not interested in people who decide to join up... with a religious fanatic and a terrorist. That's their business. Now, what have I lost? Twelve transports, seven freighters... three construction platforms... a private cruiser and a mining ship, sir. The Monarch was a blow. We can't afford to lose mining ships, not in our situation. And then there's the collateral damage. Morale is down throughout the fleet. The press is going wild, families are being split apart... Don't talk to me about family. I support the president completely. And my only priorities are the preservation of her safety... and the completion of this mission. That's all well and good, but he's still Adama's son. Yeah! Yes! When push comes to shove... how do we know he'll be willing to stand up... If it were not for him, I would still be in a Galactica jail cell. I trust him completely and this subject is closed. And what about Galactica? They know where we are. They could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason... or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist. We're not entirely defenseless. Some of our ships are armed. We should take steps to arm the others, just in case. Just in case we want to commit suicide. If Galactica wants to take us down, there is nothing we can do about it. Nothing. And nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count. At this point, it's my firm belief that Cdr. Adama has let us go. Lt. Thrace will return. She will have the Arrow of Apollo... and it will help us find our way to Earth. And exactly how long should we wait for her? I mean, maybe we should go down to the surface now. Go down now and start looking for this tomb. I wouldn't be too eager. There may still be Cylons present. And some of us will die down there. The scriptures tell us that any return to Kobol... carries with it a cost... in blood. People... I realize that there are still many... Unanswered questions here. But I refuse to lose sight of what... This has always been about: Our mission to save humanity. Yes, it's a big one. But it is our foretold destiny... and I, for one, am not going to waver from it now. If there is anyone here... who does not have the stomach for this mission... you are welcome to rejoin Cdr. Adama's fleet. It jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago. No Colonial transponder, and it's too large to be Thrace's Cylon Raider. And no response to our hails? Not a peep, Tom. It's either a Cylon vessel... or it's a Raptor scout from Galactica. Either way, we should shoot first and ask questions later. Okay. The Adriatic is in weapons range and she's got ship-to-ship missiles. Tom, that thing is moving fast. If we're... Gonna shoot it down, we better shoot it down. Shoot what down? Do I have to repeat myself? Madam President, we have a security situation, that's all. She wasn't talking to you. There's an unidentified ship making its way towards us. It's too big to be the Lieutenant's Cylon Raider. It's in weapons range. The Adriatic has to fire her missiles now. We need a decision, Madam President. Civilian vessels, civilian vessels... this is Starbuck, do you read? Do you read? Say again, this is Starbuck. Is anybody getting this? Hello? Hello? Initiate docking. Good to see you, too, Captain. Remind me to send you to the brig later. Yeah, well. Lieutenant. Lee, there's something I need to tell you. Lee, wait! Don't you frakking move! Stop! She's with us. Drop your weapon, sir. Drop your weapon. Helo. Gentlemen, I'm only going to say this once. Capt. Adama, and... What is your name? Lt. Agathon. He used to be Sharon's ECO. I thought you were dead, Helo. You a Cylon, too? Don't even... All right, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna lower your weapons. Am I being perfectly clear? What about Sharon? She will be taken to a holding cell, where she will remain unharmed. Okay. How about it, Apollo? Should we do what the nice lady says? She's the President of the Colonies, you moron. And yes, we're gonna do exactly what she says. Lower your weapons, now. Thank you. Now, put that thing out the airlock. What? We don't keep Cylons around here, Lieutenant. What the frak? You said you weren't gonna hurt her! No! Hey, Helo! Listen to me! One of those things put two rounds into my father's chest. It wasn't me! Adama was shot? Yes. You missed a few catastrophes while you were away. Please tell me he's alive. Yes. After two emergency surgeries, Cottle managed to save him. That wasn't me. Kara! For the love of gods. Wait! Listen! Sharon, this Sharon, saved our lives back on Caprica. Tell them. Tell them. I know how to find the Tomb of Athena. Do you? Kobol's a big planet. You don't find the Tomb, you don't find Earth. Listen to her, for gods' sakes. Listen to me! Madam President. Tell them to wait a minute. Yes, sir. Thank you. Mr. Zarek, is there someplace where that... young woman and I can speak? I can arrange that. It's great to see you again, Kara. Thanks for bringing in the trash. Looks like we missed all the fun. Perry? No. Well, Mueller. You know, Mueller's not a bad choice. He did a tour as a squadron X.O. Mueller's a malcontent. I know you don't want to hear this... but there is not another Apollo in this bunch... and we do have to pick a new CAG. Cdr. Adama. Lt. Birch. Please, come in. Thank you for coming in such short notice. Of course, sir. I'm sure you're aware there's been a change in the fleet. Several of our pilots departed. I was just thinking that we needed a new CAG to step up. Absolutely, sir. Who's it going to be? Congratulations, Captain. It's you. Thank you, sir. I just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew. Is that not right, Colonel? Absolutely. Here's your log book. Congratulations. I'm honored, Commander. I won't let you down. And sir, I'd just like to say that I was a tremendous supporter of your son. Capt. Adama. He was a great leader, sir. A ship is a family. It works on trust, understanding, and love. I love everyone on this ship as much as I love my... my sons. Galactica is still a family. You're an important part of that family. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Thank you, George. I'm sure you'll do a fine job. What the hell? You got me in here jawing about picking a new CAG... and you've already made your choice? I just wanted to see if you and I were on the same page or not. I beg your pardon? I guess we're not. You guessed right. You're telling me that kid is leadership material? We have very few choices and he's the best. He's a good man, Saul. He's honest and he's loyal. We need a little bit of that around here right now. Well, it's your call. I'll support it. Commander. Cdr. Adama! Can you tell us about... Can you make any comments regarding Laura Roslin... Please be seated. This thing working? Please be seated. Will you be finally addressing those issues? Commander, will you be responding... Allow me to make a statement, please. Please allow me to make a statement. Please be seated. Thank you very much. If you don't already know, the fleet has been divided. Wait! We share the grief of friends lost. And the resources we've sacrificed... will present new challenges for all of us. But if we stay together... we will rise to the occasion as we have before. Questions? Here! Yes? Do you know the coordinates... the whereabouts of President Roslin's rebellion? Do you intend to put the fleet back together? First of all, Laura Roslin is no longer president. She relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship. Next question. But, Commander... Commander... Yes, go ahead. Since the fleet has been divided... Commander, you haven't answered my question yet. We have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal... who has chosen to remain with us. This is the fleet. Thank you. This is the fleet? Commander? Commander? Is there any truth to the rumor that there is no Earth... it doesn't exist and you just made it up? What the hell kind of question is that? It's been all over talk wireless, newsletter circuit, hand mail. Freedom of the press is not a license to slander. Broadcasting that kind of garbage... is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell. That goes for all of you. We're done here. Get your hands off me. Why don't you calm down? Remind me not to do that again. Always looked easy enough when Roslin did it. There was an old footbridge over the Euclid River. I used to go there when I was a boy. Watch the fish try and swim upstream. They were mesmerizing. I envied them... unaware as they were of the... wider complexities, challenges of life. You're beginning to see human beings as we see them. What I am beginning to see are Cylon faces, everywhere I look. Sharon told me there were eight Cylons left in the fleet. Why didn't I ask her who they were? If that idiot hadn't shot her. And why is it when things go wrong, they go wrong so well... Gaius, you get yourself far, far too worked up about these things. They do have it easy, don't they? They? Why are you talking to me like I'm not one of them? In some ways, you never were. You have a path. You will be spared their fate. For once, Gaius, you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course. If there's one thing we know about human beings with certainty... they are masters of self-destruction. Because I love him. And because I'm carrying his child. Oh, I see, that explains it. You're not here because you mean us any harm... or because you're a programmed enemy of humanity. You're here because you had an affair with one of our Raptor pilots. Listen to me. I'm listening to you. That's my mistake. I'm listening to a Cylon. I am here because I chose to come here. And I know you don't believe me. But hear this, even if you find the Tomb... even if you find the map, and even if you find Earth... the price you pay will be too high. I'm not interested in your prophecies. I know that there is a Cylon force on Kobol. I know it's dangerous. And I have little doubt that you are communicating everything I say... even as we speak. It doesn't work like that. I'm not wired in. Sharon, it's simple. What I need to know and what might keep you alive... is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena. Get me a map... and I will do my best to tell you how to get to the Tomb. No, you'll do better than your best. I want to know where it is and you either know or you don't. We all know about the Tomb. I can show you the path. I don't know how long the path is, or exactly where it leads to... but I can tell you that you're gonna have to move very, very quickly. She claims to love Lt. Agathon. She says she loves the baby she's carrying. Who cares what she says? You can't believe a word, any of them. The scrolls of Pythia do speak of a lower demon... who helped the people in a time of crisis. More superstition. I've told her that unless we return from Kobol with a map to Earth... that Lt. Agathon will be put out the airlock as a Cylon conspirator. Is that true? Doesn't matter if it's true. She believed it. She saved them, both of them. She didn't have to. She could've saved her child and let them die. Why didn't she? Because I believe that she's telling the truth about one thing... she thinks she's in love. Even if it's software instead of an emotion, it's real to her. She wants her baby to live. She wants Agathon to live. We use that. This is not the way that I thought things were gonna go down. I knew they'd be suspicious, but... They're human... the way you are. Has anyone stopped to consider... that the reason Sharon knows so much about Kobol is because it's a Cylon trap? I've done more than consider it. It is clearly possible we're facing a trap. Capt. Apollo has already warned us that Cylon encounter in the region is probable. Has Capt. Apollo managed to tell us anything we don't already know? He is in charge of this mission. He is second in command only to myself. I strongly encourage you to remember that, Mr. Meier. Whatever the risks, whatever the consequences, I am going anyway. I am committed. Capt. Birch, Galactica. You're cleared for target exercise maneuvers, acknowledge. Galactica. Leader, Wilco. CAG to all Vipers. We're initiating our precision-firing exercise as planned. Hotdog, you're first up. Kat, on deck. Leader, Hotdog. Cleared to target, executing eyeball run... on three, two, one, away. Frak! Winged it. Come on, people, I know this is just a drill... but let's look sharp out there. Hotdog, I know you can do a lot better. Let's try it again. See if you can put the next one in the X-ring. Cleared hot. Ready for another pass. Leader, Kat. I'm confirming that I'm cleared for my attack run. Am I clear? Executing eyeball run. Affirmative, you're clear. Rolling in. Weapons hot. Leader, Kat. Did you say all clear? I said all clear. Okay, roger that. Let's go, baby. Here we go! Three, two, one, away! Leader, beginning strafing run. Kat, what are you doing? You said I'm clear for my attack run. Hotdog is cleared for his attack run. What? Hotdog? Back off, Kat! Now! Now! Now! Oh, my gods! Yeah! Bang on! Did you see that? Bang on? Hotdog, you frakking idiot! You almost got me killed! What are you talking about? Birch, you said I was clear! All Vipers, this is Leader. Repeat, all Vipers, this is Leader. Report back to Galactica. Report back to Galactica. Frak! I know how you feel, I get it. But I didn't shoot him, okay? It wasn't me. You're all the same. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Then maybe I'm done talking. I think there's been enough of that today. You are the last one that should be telling me what to do... after the stunt you pulled. Stealing the Cylon Raider and then tearing ass back to Caprica? Yeah, I guess you're clearly the poster boy for military discipline, huh? You know what, you have no idea what happened to me on Caprica. So while you're standing here polishing off your halo, consider for a second... that you may not have any damned idea what the hell you're talking about... Captain. What Roslin's doing is reckless. We have our own fleet now. How much longer... do we need to keep playing follow the leader? We have a fleet because people believe Roslin's going to lead them to Earth. She's a fraud. You don't believe her, do you? No, but I believe in the power of myth. I'm not interested in risking our lives any more than you are... but she's clearly not gonna be talked out of this. And in the end, president or prophet, it doesn't really matter. She still needs a commander, a man in charge of the fleet. The man with the guns makes the rules. What if she decides you're not the man to be in charge of the fleet? What if she has someone else in mind? Someone already close to her, like a certain captain? Let's say you're right, that on some level... based on their belief in the scriptures... the fleet needs Laura Roslin in order to stay in line. So we do what we must in order to keep Roslin safe on the surface of Kobol. But... But? You're right. You're absolutely right. How could I have not have seen that? I want to set this fleet on a path to freedom. Of course. I want to deliver unto them the liberty we've promised. We are far from daylight, my friend. The scriptures say some of us will die on Kobol. One man in particular. Tank to Striker. Your approach is a little off the center line. Striker, reset your delta to 0.35, acknowledge. Striker, how's my approach speed? Tanker to Striker. Your angle vectors are too steep for junct. I repeat, your angle vectors are too steep for junct. Tanker, request heading, one-tenth of the way. What is he doing? This is Tanker. Tell him to cut his speed. What is it this time? I'm glad you're here. Birch is coordinating the ships for refueling... but he's making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book! How long has he been at it? About four hours now. Sir, he's too green. He's blowing the approach and the docking speeds... he's missing the drogues, he's bunching the lines. It's a mess out there. As you know, this isn't the first screw-up. Yes, I know. I realize that he is your guy. But he's no Apollo. Moving on 709... I was wondering when we'd finally get a little R and R around here. Oh, boy. Can I have my ball back? What, I can't hold it? Can I have my ball back, please? Where'd you get a Pyramid ball, anyway? Caprica. Can I have my ball back, Lee? Yeah, sure. Lee. Keep it. Hey come on, Kara. For frak's sake, I'm just kidding around. All right, here, it's all yours. You can take your ball and go home now. The whole thing's stupid anyway. What's up with you, Kara? Anything you want to talk about? Nope. Must have been hard... being back on Caprica... being home. Probably saw some tough things back there. Anyway, tomorrow this whole thing's gonna end, one way or another. We find the Tomb or we don't. We find a way to Earth or we don't. I just want you to know, Kara, that I'm your friend. I love you. If there's anything you want to talk about... anything you wanna get off your chest, then I'm here for you. Anyway, whenever you wanna talk just let me know. What was that middle part again? What do you mean? Did you say you love me? Well... Lee Adama loves me. No. All I meant was... No, seriously, very sweet. You love me. No, you love me. You can't take it back. There's no take-backs. You're dreaming it, Kara. You love me. You're dreaming it. You love me. Dreamer. Mmm-hmm. Okay. This is Striker. I'm having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar. Can you redirect? Gas station, Striker's coming in way too hot. You gotta back off your delta, like right now. Roger that. Correcting approach angle. Didn't you hear us? Back off your delta. You're too close! Are you listening? Okay. We are not too close. Abort. Abort the op. Striker, remain on target. Recall the ships. Galactica, all ships involved in fuel unrep, abort mission. Say again, abort fuel unrep. Raptors, return to base, acknowledge. Wilco, Galactica. Aborting mission. Damn it! Roger that. Galactica says abort approach. Attempt angle vector full reverse. Striker, you're still on a collision course. Put your helm hard left, full reverse thrusters, back off. Look out! Galactica, Emmitt. Tanker's intact. No wireless contact, but it's in an axis spin and there does appear to be some damage. Away rescue team, tell them to board the tanker and restore navigational control. Away rescue team, to section 046. Here. You never know when you might need to defend yourself. Here we go. "And the blaze pursued them, and the people of Kobol had a choice... "to board the great ship or take the high road through the rocky ridge. " "And the body of each tribe's leader was offered to the gods... "in the Tomb of Athena. " Yes. Precisely. And the great ship was a galleon that departed from here, where we're standing. And it took the founders of the 13 colonies to their destiny. And those that didn't board the galleon took the high road... the rocky ridge that led to the Tomb. Let's move. The path is supposed to be marked by gravestones. There's something there. Wait! Get back! Get back! Get back! Sharon! Sharon, take cover! Switch. Nice one. Ammo! Here. Lee, no! You gotta be frakking kidding me. Not bad. It's interesting. Betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind. It's almost like a python. It can squeeze out all other thought... suffocate all other emotion, until... everything is dead except for the rage. I'm not talking about anger. I'm talking about rage. I can feel it, right here... like it's gonna burst. I feel like I wanna scream... right now, matter of fact. If I may say something... Speak your mind, Dee. I don't think the problem is that you've been betrayed. I think it's that you feel helpless. You were shot, you were injured, you couldn't do anything. Don't make excuses for me. And when you finally had a chance to do something... I'm sorry I did this. ...you let us down. You let us down. You made a promise... to all of us... to find Earth... to find us a home... together. It doesn't matter what the President did, or even what Lee did. Because every day that we remain apart... is a day that you've broken your promise. People aboard those ships made their own decision. It was their decision, not mine. Thank you, Petty Officer. You may leave now. You asked to talk to me, sir. Maybe because you think that I don't have anything to say. But I do. It's time to heal the wounds, Commander. People have been divided. I said, that's enough. Children are separated from their parents. A cost in blood. Let's go, Madam President. Mr. Gaeta. I want to see all recon material on Kobol immediately in my quarters. Aye, sir. Kobol? Yes. I'm putting the fleet back together. I'm putting our family back together. This ends now.
