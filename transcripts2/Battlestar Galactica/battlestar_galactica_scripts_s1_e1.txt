 MALE NARRATOR: PreviousIy on Battlestar Galactica. Now you're telling you're a machine. The robot. You knew l wanted access to the defense mainframe. Do you have any idea what they will do to me if they find out? Get down. ADAMA: Moments ago, this ship received word of a Cylon attack against our home worlds is underway. As of this moment, we are at war. All right, we can take three more people. Giving up my seat.

 l've decided you're an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states. So l'm only in your head? No. There maybe Cylon agents living among us. Some may not even know they're Cylons at all. They could be sleeper agents programed to perfectly impersonate human beings untiI activation. (CLOCK TlCKlNG) (TICKING ECHOING) (CONTROLS BEEPlNG) And one minute to mark. (BEEPlNG) God has a plan for you, Gaius. He has a plan for everything and everyone.

 Gaius? Are you even listening to me? MAN ON PA: Passengers, 30 seconds to mark. ROSLlN: Planet. Men. Women. Age. You know what? Do this after the jump. lt's all right. Go ahead. (SlGHS) (CLOCK TlCKlNG) You have to believe in something. l believe in a world that l can and do understand. A rational universe explained through rational means. (SNlCKERS) l love you. That's not rational. l know. No, but you're not rational. You're also not really here. Neither am l. PILOT: Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our 33 minutes are almost up once again. Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump. Thank you. Cutting it a little close this time, aren't we, Billy? Pilot says they've had to reboot the FTL computer again. CALLY: Why do the Cylons come every 33 minutes? Why isn't it 34, 35. . . TYROL: Cally. What? Shut up. 1 5 seconds. Sir, jump 237 underway. 53 ships have jumped. 1 0 still reporting trouble with their FTL drives, including Colonial One. We're getting slower. (TlMER BEEPlNG) Maybe this time. (BEEPlNG) ALARM BUZZlNG) GAETA: Dradis contact. lt's the Cylons. Damn it. Not this time, maybe the next. ALARM BUZZlNG) l got another idea for the next cycle. PILOT: Ladies and gentIemen, I'm afraid the CyIons have appeared again. However, our FTL drive is now working and we will jump momentarily. Five days now. There are limits to the human body, the human mind. Tolerances that you can't push beyond. Those are facts, provable facts. Everyone has their limit. All right, you know the drill, people. Scatter formation. APOLLO: Keep them off the civies and don't stray beyond the recovery line. Watch the ammo hoists for the main guns. You've got a red light right there. (EXPLOSlONS) (ELECTRlClTY SURGlNG) ALARM BEEPlNG) We have a hit on the starboard bow. Away the damage control parties. Basestar is launching raiders. CoIoniaI One is ready to jump. All civilian ships away, including Colonial One. Recover fighters. Stand by to jump. Combat landings. All fighters aboard, sir. Execute jump. (BLEEPS) Jump 237 complete. All civilian ships present and accounted for, sir. Start the clock. And let's start prepping for the next jump. Clock is running. 33 minutes. Mark. You got 32 minutes, people. (GASPS) You know you're not safe. No, of course not. The Cylons will follow us again, as they have the last 237 times. You're right, you know. There are limits. Eventually, you'll make a mistake. And then you'll kill us all. Yes. Yes, l know. But not for another 33 minutes. (CLOCK TlCKlNG) ADAMA: l want to try something new this time. Divide the fleet into six groups. Then they jump. . . ADAMA SlGHS) Then they jump two more times and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at a common set of coordinates. 24 jumps to plot, we're breaking our humps calculating one jump every 33 minutes. Get off my jacket. Are you eating this? Not anymore. APOLLO: Combat landings expected again to be the order of the day, so double-check your undercarriage before. . . Look, you've all done this 237 times. You know what to do. No mistakes. And let's make it to 238. And good luck and be careful out there. Can you do me a favor? Tell Captain Apollo he owes me one wing. DAVE: You got it, Chief. No, Cally, there's three. l know there's three. Can you check it again for me, please? Yeah. At least get some of them starting to work. We'll sleep when we're dead. Come on. Boomer. Heard the latest? They say Cylons look like us now. Primary fuel? Primary fuel 2893 KRG. Marine told one of the pilots that we marooned some guy back on Ragnar because they actually thought that he was a Cylon. You know what? l don't give a frak. Red light on the number four thruster. Go make a visual lD. See if it's blocked. Right. A little rough on your new ECO, don't you think? He's not my ECO. He's some refugee from Triton that l've been saddled with and l didn't ask you. Helo's gone, Sharon. l didn't ask you that, either. Sorry. Colony? Saggitaron. How many have you got? 5,251 survivors from Saggitaron, last count. We can't transmit photos yet. lf you want, you can leave them with us or you can put them on the board outside. Sorry. Thanks. Next. Colony? Update on the headcount, Madam President. How did we lose 300? There were some overcounts, a few deaths from wounds and a few missing during the last attack. Do you want children, Gaius? Let me think about that for a minute. No. Procreation is one of God's commandments. Really? l'm sure someday, if you're a good Cylon, he'll reward you with a lovely little walking toaster of your very own. l want us to have a child, Gaius. You can't be serious. lt's Dr. Amarak. What was that? l'm so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking. You were just saying? Oh ! Uh. . . l was just saying that a Dr. Amarak had requested to speak with the President. Dr. Amarak. l see. You know him? Have you always been able to multitask like this? Yes. Yes. l used to work with him at the Ministry of Defense. lt says here that he's uncovered important information regarding how the Cylons were able to defeat colonial defenses. l was always a little worried he was on to us. Were you going to speak to him? Perhaps l should speak to him if you're busy. Actually, l think he wanted to speak directly with the President. lt sounded urgent. lt must be very important. Maybe something about a certain traitor in the President's inner circle? There's not enough time before we jump. l want him on board first thing during the next cycle. Thank you, Doctor. l'd say you have a serious problem. lf l can help. He's a strange one, isn't he? (RAlN PATTERlNG) (PANTlNG) (GRUNTS) (BEEPS) (CYLON WHlRRlNG) (SHOUTlNG) (SlGHS) PILOT: Landing Bay, Team Alpha... Did you see it? Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion. That makes 61 . Have the docs start pumping them up with stimulants and get them back on the line. Pilots, too. Fuel report. One out of every three, every other cycle. That's going to come back and bite us in the ass. We have too much work and not enough people to do it. DUALLA: Fuel report. l've already signed one of these. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Comm traffic two from the President. ls this my 1 0 minutes or this yours? Yours. l took 1 0 last time. l'll see you guys in combat. l believe it was your 1 0 minutes. lf the old man's so tired he can't remember, then it's his turn. You see the note from the XO? Yeah, l saw it. No way. APOLLO: Kara, everyone else. . . l don't fly with stims. They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time. Come on, Kara, give me a break. Just. . . Why are we arguing about this? l have no idea. Neither do l. You're the CAG, act like one. What the hell does that mean? lt means that you're still acting like you're everyone's best friend. We're not friends, you're the CAG. "Be careful out there"? Our job isn't to be careful, it's to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky. "Good hunting" is what you say. And now, one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child and refusing to take her pills. So she either says, "Yes, sir," and obeys a direct order or you smack her in the mouth and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay and you make her take those pills. (SNlCKERS) Well, l'm glad l'm not working for you. You're damn right you're glad. So, do l have to smack you in the mouth, Lieutenant? No, sir. l'll take my pills. Oh ! Perfect. (CLEARS THROAT) Carry on. Yes, sir. MAN ON PA: PiIots to ready room for pre-flight briefing. Pilots to ready room. What? (GROANS) Jump 238 complete. Start the clock. 33 minutes. Mark. All civilian ships present and. . . (BLEEPlNG) Strike my last. One civilian ship missing and unaccounted for, sir. Which one? The OIympic Carrier. Commercial passenger vessel. Were they left behind? l think l accounted for all civilian ships before we left. You think? Did you or didn't you? They're not logged in, sir. l think they may have been left behind. How many people aboard ship? 1 ,345 souls, sir. You're telling me we left over 1 ,300 people to die at the hands of the Cylons? lt may not have been her fault, sir. lt may have simply been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates or the Cylons destroyed the ship before they jumped. . . Or 50 other things may have happened. The point is we don't know what the hell did happen. Yes, we're tired. Yes, there's no relief. Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us time after time after time and yes, we are still expected to do our jobs. We make mistakes, people die. There aren't many of us left. Carry on. Okay. Next crisis? (SlGHS) List of calls? Yes. But first, where's the doctor that's supposed to be on board? What's his name? Dr. Amarak. Yes. Dr. Amarak. Oh. He was on the OIympic Carrier. God is watching out for you, Gaius. The universe is a vast and complex system. Coincidental, serendipitous events are bound to occur. lndeed they are to be expected. lt's part of the pattern, part of the plan. Dr. Amarak posed a threat to you. Now he's gone. Logic says there's a connection. A connection, maybe. But not God. There is no God or gods, singular or plural. There are no large invisible men, or women for that matter, in the sky taking a personal interest in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar. Be careful. That which God gives, he can also take away. 1 5 seconds. (BEEPlNG) Maybe this time. Dradis? No enemy contacts. Keep the clock running. What do you think? l think we wait. (BEEPlNG) (SlGHS) Get me the President. Why this time? Was it something that you did? We had a new plan, but we didn't have time to implement it yet. We lost that ship during the last cycle, the OIympic Carrier. Does that have something to do with it? ADAMA: Possibly. Are you there? Yeah, l'm here. What do we do now, Commander? l've got people on the verge over here. We're going to go to Condition Two. We have to take advantage of this time and let our people get some rest. All right. And how long do we stay at Condition Two? Until l'm satisfied they're not going to return. lt's a military decision. lt is. l know that. You're right and l defer to your decision. And, Commander, let your men and women know how grateful l am for the job that they are doing, please. Thank them for me. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you. Contact Apollo. Tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet and order his other pilots to land immediately. All right, people, you heard the order. Boomer, Starbuck, form up with me. We'll fly the first CAP. l want everyone else back on Galactica and in their racks. Three-hour rotation. STARBUCK: Hey, Apollo, not that l'm not honored by being chosen to sit in my cockpit for the next three hours but. . . But why you? Take a guess. Because l'm on drugs? You got it. This patrol is 1 00% stimulated. (STARBUCK LAUGHING) CRASHDOWN: Anyone eIse feeIs Iike they have frakking ants crawling behind their eyeballs? APOLLO: How about you, Boomer? Doc tells me you're holding up better than anybody in the squadron. BOOMER: l'm tired like everybody else. APOLLO: You never seem it. STARBUCK: That's 'cause she's a CyIon. You're going to make me come over there and kick your ass. Okay. Let's set up a patrol here before somebody gets hurt. Follow me. STARBUCK: Copy that, Apollo. Oh ! A couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet right about now. You deserve it. You know, the truth is all this has me feeling more alive than l have in years. You look that way, too. lt's good to see you without the cup in your hand. Don't start. l know there's a whole lot of people aboard this ship that wish you weren't feeling as good as you are. lf the crew doesn't hate the XO, then he's not doing his job. Besides, got to make the old man look good. l always look good. Did you look in a mirror? Seriously. . . Sir. . . .it's one thing to push the crew, it's another to break them. GAETA: Dradis contact. Bearing 348, carom 1 20, one ship. Getting recognition signal. COMPUTER: Initiating response flash mode. Alpha, alpha. lt's the Olympic Carrier, sir. ls that confirmed? lt's confirmed, sir. Thank the gods. Action stations. Put the fleet into Condition One. l want all Vipers manned and ready, but keep them in the tubes. Mr. Gaeta. Sir? Restart the clock. 33 minutes. ALARM BLARlNG) l hope you're wrong. So do l. GAETA: CIock is running. So do l. No. lt's all wrong. lf they were left behind, why didn't the Cylons destroy them? And why are they showing up now? lt's God's punishment for your lack of faith. That's just great, that is. A more logical and useful explanation, please. All right. The OIympic Carrier has been infiltrated by Cylon agents. They've been tracking the ship all along. No. Then that means. . . Logically, in order for you to survive the OIympic Carrier should be destroyed. BOOMER: Olympic Carrier, Olympic Carrier, this is Raptomr 478, call sign Boomer. l have you in visuaI contact. Please respond on this channeI. Over. MAN ON RADlO: Raptomr 478, this is the Olympic Carrier. We have you in visual contact. Thank the Lords of KoboI. You don't know how relieved we are to see you. BOOMER: Roger that, Olympic Carrier. Can l ask about your whereabouts? MAN: We had troubIe with our FTL drive. Took us aImost three hours to fix. Have Boomer ask them how they escaped the Cylons. Olympic Carrier, Boomer. I've been directed to ask how you escaped from the CyIons. MAN: You got me. They were closing in on us when the rest of you were jumping. l thought we were goners, then they just broke off. Someone must've been watching out for us. BOOMER: Roger that. One other thing, Boomer. l've got a Dr. Amarak on board who has an urgent matter to discuss with the President. He's been driving me crazy. OIympic Carrier, can you be more specific? l'm afraid l can't. He says he knows something about a traitor in our midst and he's unwilling to share any more than that. Madam President, l strongly recommend that we cut off all wireless communication with that ship right away. (STUTTERlNG) Why? Look, forgive me for being rude, but wake up, all right? The only reason the OIympic Carrier is still flying is because the Cylons let them survive. They've been tracking that ship all along. There's probably a Cylon agent aboard right now! Calm down. Start over. Please, Madam President, l implore you. Listen to me. Cut off radio communication with that ship before they send via broadcast signal another computer virus to infect our ship shortly before they blow us all up. Commander Adama, are you on the line? Cut off the speakers. Put it through the line. Yes, Madam President. And l'm inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar. Good. So do l. Thank the gods you're with us. God's got nothing to do with this. Boomer, Galactica. Your orders are to jam all transmissions from the OIympic Carrier. No further voice contact is authorized. Roger that, Galactica. DUALLA: Boomer, Galactica. Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier the following message by signal light. Message begins, "Maintain present position. "Do not, repeat, do not approach the fleet untiI further notice." Message ends. l'm getting a bad feeling about where this is headed. So am l. lf the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat. l don't think they got the message, Apollo. Yeah, l see it. Boomer, break wireless silence on my authority. Warn them to stop their engines immediately. l suggest that we evacuate the passengers and destroy the ship. lt solves the problem if they're tracking the ship. What if they're tracking one of the passengers? BOOMER: Olympic Carrier, Olympic Carrier, you are ordered to stop your engines immediately. Acknowledge. Apollo, they're not responding. APOLLO: Are you using the same channeI? Yeah, but suddenly nobody's home. Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow. Copy that. (SNlCKERS) Boomer, let Galactica know we have a problem out here. Commander, message from Boomer. The OIympic Carrier is heading directly for us, sir. They're refusing all orders to stop. (BEEPlNG) BOOMER: Galactica, they're still not responding and continue to head toward the fIeet. Request instructions. Order the fleet to execute Jump 240. Get us between that ship and the fleet. Commander! Dradis contact. Strike that, multiple Dradis contacts. lt's the Cylons. ALARM BLARlNG) CRASHDOWN: The CyIons are on an intercept course. They'll be in weapons range within two minutes. ALARM SOUNDlNG) Radiological alarm ! From where? The OIympic Carrier, sir. They've got nukes on board. Madam President, we have to eliminate the Olympic Carrier immediately. There are 1 ,300 people on that ship. ADAMA: We don't know that. The CyIons may have captured them already. She's not going to do it. She has to do it. lt's not her decision, Gaius. No? lt's God's choice. He wants you to repent. Look, at this point there's no choice. lt's either them or us. Repent of your sins. Accept his true love and you will be saved. l repent. There, l repent. l repent. Do it. BOOMER: We have new orders. We're directed to destroy the Olympic Carrier and return to Galactica. lt's a civilian ship. APOLLO: Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes. l don't see anybody in there, do you? The Cylons will be here any second. lf we're going to do this, let's just do it. Starbuck, form up with me. We'II make one pass from astern. STARBUCK: Lee, what if you're wrong? Lee, come on. Lee. Okay, fire on my mark. No frakking way, Lee. Lee? Come on ! (BEEPlNG) Mark. (GASPlNG) Are you alive? (PANTlNG) Agathon, Karl C. Lieutenant, junior grade, Colonial Fleet. PK-789-9348. l know who you are, Helo. lt's all right. l'm a friend. (GUNS FlRlNG) (GROANS) (GAGS) Sharon? What are you doing here? Can you walk? Yeah, l think so. (GRUNTS) What are you doing here, l thought. . . Let's move, mister. Sir. Son. l gave the order. lt was my responsibility. l pulled the trigger. That's mine. BlLLY: Madam President? Madam President? l'm sorry, you were saying something? Twenty-four hours, no Cylons. At least you know it was the right choice. The right choice. l'm sorry, Billy. l think l'd like some time alone, please. Of course. What is it? Update on the headcount. Subtract how many? Actually, you can add one. A baby was born this morning on the Rising Star. A boy. A baby. Yeah. Thank you.
