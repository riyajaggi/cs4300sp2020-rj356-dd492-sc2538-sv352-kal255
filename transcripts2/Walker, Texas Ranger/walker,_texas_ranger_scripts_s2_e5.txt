 Almost forgot the ring. Perfect timing. Oh... You're beautifully dressed. A mite nervous. Well, I've never done this before. I'll take you through step by step. Be gentle with me. Where'd you learn to tie a tie? My daddy said it would come in handy in impressing a man. Daddy was right. Uh, excuse me, folks.

 Uh, I'm lookin' for the wedding. Right inside. Uh, thank you very much. You're beautiful. That's what we get for letting C.D. handle the music. I heard that. I tried to get the Peter Duchin band, and they're busy. Come on now. We're late. This is it. Whew. Okay, keep it runnin'. Well, you ready to get hitched, Hoss? She finally roped me, Cordell. It's just a good thing my dress is permanent press.

 Had him at the altar twice before, but then duty called. Well, you know what they say. Three's the charm. Now that Hoss is tying the knot, Washoe, how long are you gonna be dragging your feet? Well, I think I'll drag my feet a while longer, Uncle Ray. ♪ Treat me like a fool ♪ ♪ Treat me mean and cruel ♪ ♪ But love me ♪ ♪ Break my faithful heart ♪ He sung that in Blue Hawaii. Boy, that reminds me of my first wedding. Did you honeymoon in Hawaii? No. We caught the King in the Astrodome. Hell of an act. ♪ I'll be sad and blue ♪ ♪ Cryin' over you ♪ ♪ Dear, always ♪ Everybody on the floor! Get down! Get down! Face down! I said down! All right, you uncuff him. Don't move. Come on. Hurry up. Don't shoot, please. Let's do it. Let's do it. Go. Go. Go! Get down! I'll be right back, hon. I knew it. Hoss Tanner, you be careful. Texas Rangers! Hold it right there! Get down, Hoss! Call an ambulance. I can't get a clear shot. Oh! Walker! Gimme your hand! Come with me. We didn't do this to leave you here. Go this way. Let's go! Come on. You! Out! Get out of that thing! Move it! Whoa, whoa, don't shoot me. Here, take the truck. Move it! Get out! Go, go! That's a girl. I can see that. Boy, she's beautiful, Walker. I can see that too. Now, cuff her. Yeah. Right. Um... Now, look, I did not know that you were a girl. Now you do! Come on! You... Whew, man. I can't believe Trigger, going to all this trouble for me? Don't kid yourself, Axel. If those rangers had taken your lights out back there, Trigger would be selling tickets to your wake. Well, then who sprung me? Trigger's been running point since I left. Come on, who? It was Katt. What? She busted me out, and you let me leave her back there? Listen, Trigger's the one you ought to be worrying about. He was gonna let you rot. Yeah. So now they got Katt. Come on, chill. Look, use your head. Katt's got the goods on Trigger for that beef in New Orleans. Now, he's gonna be freakin' that she's gonna testify. So, what are you saying? So, what am I saying? I'm saying this is your chance to take back the crew. Crew don't mean jack without her. That's an M-16. Vintage, Vietnam. Left behind in the getaway car. Serial number tracks to a weapons shipment stolen from Fort Gage, Louisiana. Axel Tate, the prisoner they broke loose, worked as a civilian employee there. Feds say that he was the inside man on an arms smuggling ring. He got busted for speeding through Denton. That's when the felony warrant came up. Judge was signing his extradition order when the wedding was interrupted. Okay, so how does she figure? The only prior pulled up was a possession charge, where she got time served. We're still not sure, but the feds seem to think she knows something. She's wanted as the material witness at the trial in New Orleans. Okay, wait a minute. What? Every time you serve coffee and sweet rolls, there's always a catch. Walker, you're so cynical. It's a gift. "Order of extradition. The witness will hereby be transported..." Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out! Now, see, I... First of all, I can't go. A certain employee of the county and I are going away on vacation this weekend to Cancun for two days. I'm using my frequent flyer miles. So that means sunset walks on the beach, cold margaritas, hold the salt, thank you very much. You mean Trisha said yes? After two months of saying no. And second, I wouldn't get on a plane with this woman if you paid my way to law school. I wouldn't get on a plane with her if you paid off my Trans-Am. I'd rather have a root canal done. You see this? You see? I'm sorry, James. This takes top priority. Oh, counselor... She's testifying against Jinks. Trigger Jinks? The one and only. When did he get out of Huntsville? Year ago. Federal mandate. Overcrowding. They cut a dime off his sentence. Who is Trigger Jinks? He's the guy that killed Elton Jenner. The Ranger captain? He's the one that broke me in. Elton busted Jinks for gun-running back in '80. They found him shot in the back with a .44 while Jinks was out on bail awaiting trial. Same caliber as Jinks' gun, but they never found a weapon or a witness. So Jinks only went down for smuggling? Exactly. So let's get this gal to New Orleans so she can testify and put him behind bars for good. Hey, look at the bright side: a flight to New Orleans, you get more frequent flyer points. Ah, damn! Whoo! Oh-ho-ho! Hey. Someone plan a war and didn't invite me? Hey, when'd you get sprung? Katt got me out. Katt? Really? Yeah. She got nailed by the Texas Rangers doing it. Yeah. How come I didn't hear about this? Since when do we have to run things by you? Since I got elected president. That's bull. This was my daddy's crew. And when he died, he left it to me. No, that's bull, you little piece of crap. Guess what. I am changing the will. You better back the hell off, Trigger. I'm warning you, man. Oh, yeah? Hey, come on, boys. Tell him who's in charge. Montez? Gurgin? Nobody? Huh, nobody? You just lost the inheritance, kid. It seems I got the soldiers, and I got the toys. Any questions? No. No, what? No, sir. Good. Good. Well, we got some business to do. The crew had been a little top-heavy. I say we cut personnel. Like who? Like a certain little twist with long nails, long legs up to here, mouth that won't stop. Look... I guarantee she's not gonna testify. You're right. 'Cause I'm carving her name on a tombstone. And if you are extra good... Hm? I'll let you watch. Thank you. All right, Miss Prather, let's go. We're gonna take a trip. Nope. I guess you didn't hear the man. Now, move. Let's go. Why? You're going to New Orleans. Oh, no, I'm not. Yes, you are. No. Turn around. You settle down, young lady. Tae kwon do, the belt is black. Yeah, picked the wrong guy this time. Now, behave. You okay? Yeah, I'm all right. Then would you cuff her, please? Flight 229, non-stop service to New Orleans, now boarding at gate 23. I don't fly, especially in weather like this. Well, today you do. So, what if I refused? What are you gonna do? Drag me on the plane kicking and screaming? If we have to. Now, let's go. No... There's a bomb on the plane! There's a bomb! Terrorists have called in a threat! Don't go on! Don't go on! Get off! There's a bomb on the plane! Hey, look... A phony bomb scare is a federal offence. Now, shut up. It's going to crash! It's gonna crash, everyone! Don't... Don't go on! Sorry, Rangers. You know the drill. Transporting a fugitive is at the airline's discretion. Now, you can't keep her quiet, you got to keep her off. Okay. So, what do we do? We drive. Where's the car rental place? Outside gate 17. Thanks. Sorry. It's okay, folks. There's no bomb. Everything's all right. I can walk by myself. Why don't I just shoot her in the foot? Why don't you try it? Get your head down. All right, here's the rules: It's 517 miles to New Orleans. It'll take us about nine hours to get there. We'll take a break about every hour and a half for you to go to the ladies room. We'll stop once to eat. Any questions? Yeah, I, um... I get carsick, so which one of you Boy Scouts do I barf on? Right. Well, you want her to barf on you? Hey, listen up. They're not flyin'. They're drivin'. They're in an '86 Ford gray Taurus, Texas license plate, JHC47K, South 360 to 30. Figure that they'll hit 80 East to New Orleans. I'm telling you, man. She's not gonna testify. She ain't goin' for Mardi Gras. What are they packing? Packin' light. Just handguns. Good. Now, you stay with them and call in. Think you're underestimati" those boys, Trigger. Is that right? Yeah. What is it they say? Only takes one Ranger to stop a riot? Yeah, well, I can tell you firsthand, it only takes one riot to stop a Ranger. ♪ These days ♪ ♪ These days ♪ These handcuffs are cutting off my circulation. I put 'em as loose as I could. Look. I'm bleeding. You know you did that with your fingernail. I did not. Come on, can you just take 'em off for a few minutes till the circulation can run back through my arms, please? What do you think, Walker? Okay, but watch her. Fine. Oh! Halt! Stop it! Halt! Come on. Get up... Get up. Put me down. I can walk. Open the trunk. Really? Open the trunk, Walker. No, way! You can't put me in there. I'll suffocate. What kind of witness am I gonna make if I can't breathe? I'll choke on his gun. Did we get the insurance? Yeah, why? Whoa. You are crazy. Get in there. Get in there! You are out of your mind. Maybe if you settle down, he'll let you back in the car. The two of you can kiss my... Hey! Hey! Okay, okay, I'll settle down. I can't figure out this probation report, man. Why? Listen to this. "Katherine Prather born November 16, 1964, "Homer, Texas. "Captain of the volleyball team, "valedictorian of her class, full scholarship to Howard University." Really? How does somebody like that become the wheelman on a bust-out? I don't know. Uncle Ray says, "Show me your company, I'll tell you who you are." You better have news for me, Hendrix. They're on 80, about five miles west of Longview. We're a half-hour back. Stay on 'em. Gimme the sniper rifle. What the hell you need that thing for? You got enough firepower to stop the Rangers. There's only one thing I want to stop, and it's that broad from testifying. Hey, come on, man. That's my girl. Now, you better listen to me, my friend. You got one chance to show these boys here you still got the plumbing for this crew. What are you talking about? Sacrifice. You're gonna make the kill. And if you don't, then guess what. What? Think about it. You'll figure it out. We need to get some gas. I'll grab the sandwiches. Why don't you see if she needs to go to the bathroom? Whoa. Wait... Wait a minute. Why don't I go get the sandwiches? Wh... Wh... Why do I have to take her? 'Cause you're the ladies' man. Prather, you think you're ready to sit up front with us, now? As soon as I get to an attorney, I am suing you for false imprisonment. I thought that's what... If you don't let me into a bathroom, I'm gonna scream. Just a second. Anybody in there? All right. Let's go. Oh, you've got to be kidding. I'm not going in there with you. Look, I got three sisters... I don't care what you've got. I've got a right to my privacy. Then you can't go to the bathroom... Okay, wait... Wait, please. Okay, look, I'm in pain. My bladder is going to erupt. Just take these off, and I give you my word of honor I am not gonna try and escape. Okay? I cross my heart. Please? Come on, come on! You said, "Cross my heart," but you forgot to say, "Hope to die." Sightseeing? Walker. You're a long ways from court, Hendrix. Hey, come on, Walker. What are you taking my gun for? Well, I heard you dropped it real fast in court when those boys came in. Answer it. Leave it on speaker. Don't make me ask twice. Okay... Okay. Okay. Yeah? Hendrix, they still at the truck stop? Ye... Yeah. Wh... Where are you guys? We're two miles up the road. Keep 'em there. Yeah, okay. Trivette, get in the car! Trigger Jinks is right behind us! I'll settle with you later. If Hendrix is here, Axel can't be too far behind, and he is gonna get me out. Don't count on it. KATT: Yes! Hey, you! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Don't shoot him! Don't! Stop it! Don't shoot him. Oh, no. Here. Stop it! Stop it. Get back in the car! Stop it! Come on, come on. Axel! Hey, baby, right here, Axel! Here I am! Come on. We got a train to catch. Let's go. Come on. Get him! Walker! It's headed for Palmer and Holtsville. Tyson's in Holtsville. Get him on the line. Get going! Move! Tell him to wait for that train! Why don't you explain to me how a simple escort job turns into witness protection and aggravated assault, attempted carjacking and kidnapping and attempted murder? It'll put Trigger away for good. If he doesn't put us away first. Well, we just can't let that happen. I'd feel a whole lot easier if we weren't sitting like the meat in a sandwich a hundred miles from nowhere, with a woman marked for death. Well, if it was easy, anyone would do it. Aw, come on, get out of there. Damn it, they jumped. Check those other box cars. Trigger's gonna go ballistic. Ow! Ow! Ow! Let me take a look. Ow. Walker. I think I sprained it running for the train. All right, I'm gonna cut you loose. But I want a "cross my heart and hope to die" promise that you're not gonna try and bolt on me. I swear to God. How bad is it? It's bad. I am so sorry, you guys. That's okay. All right, here's what we're gonna do. You take Katt and get to Bridgeton. I'll stay behind. If Trigger tries to follow, I'll slow him down. Here. Take this. Okay? Good luck. Is he kidding? Trigger and his men are armed. I wouldn't want to be in their shoes either. Come on. Yeah. Trigger, it's Tyson. They're not here. Not there. I thought that train didn't stop between here and Holtsville. They must have jumped. You find where they jumped off. If you don't, I'll take care of you, instead. You blew it, my friend. But this cat ain't gonna have nine lives. This time, it is my turn. Yo. They're headed east. Going right through there. Okay. We'll leave the truck here. Let's go. Listen, I heard you talking to Trigger. This is that Indian Ranger, Walker, right? I heard a lot of bad stuff about him from guys in the joint, him being part Indian and all. Oh, is that right? Then maybe you want to stay here. Tell them campfire stories to Trigger when he gets here. Now, let's get moving. Let me ask you something. What's the valedictorian of her class doing with a slug like Axel Tate anyway, huh? You don't want to know. Actually, I do. I kinda have this thing about people that I'm on the run with. I, um... I grew up nearby. I never knew my dad. My mama left. I was raised by my granny. That the picture in the locket? I saw it when we were on the train. Yeah. She always wanted the best for me. She used to always say, "Baby, chase your dreams." She raised me to believe that I could do whatever I wanted to do. So, what happened to college? Granny got sick. Medical insurance ran out. She was too proud for welfare. We needed money for her medical attention. So, um... Along comes Axel. And he said I could make 20 grand easily just by carrying this little package. So you were a courier. Just once. Once is all it took. After that, Trigger and his crew owned me. Axel was gonna help me get out. That's why I sprung him. We were gonna run away together, start again. It's never too late. So you ready to go? Yeah. Let's go. Looks like they went this way. I think we got about three more miles. Can you make it? Yeah. Yeah. I can make it. You know... I've kicked you, I've scratched you, and if I could've gotten your gun, I'm sure I would've shot you. So why? Let's just say I agree with your granny. I think you're worth saving. How's that for an excuse? Oh, man, I hate this. I hate graveyards. Close your eyes. Hold Spencer's hand. Does this place give you the heebie-jeebies? I had an uncle that ran a funeral home. I used to hide every time we had to go visit him. I was always afraid that them dead folks he was working on in the back room, would rise up and start walking towards me. You know what I mean, Vern? Vern? Vern? What are you trying to do? Raise the dead? I think they're already up. Something's happened to Vern. He's gone. Gone? What do you mean, gone? Gone. Gone. What's "gone" mean? He was there, then he wasn't... Something's happened to him. Listen, he either got lost, or he chickened out on us. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes when Trigger gets ahold of him. Now, let's go. Come on. Oh. So cold in here too. Got to think Jamaica. Jamaica? Why Jamaica? A trick my mother taught me when I was growing up in Baltimore. Middle of winter. Half the time, the pipes would go out. Get so cold in the bedroom, you could see your breath. She used to say, "think of someplace warm you'd rather be." For me it was Ocho Rios, Jamaica. With Bob Marley. All right. How's your ankle? It's still a little sore. Yeah. Hey. Hm? You thinking about your partner, aren't you? Walker? No, no. He can take care of himself. You know how they say there are no more heroes? Let me tell you, the man is tenacious. No matter what he's up against, he just keeps on coming. That's his code. What about you? What's your code? I don't like bullies. Like Trigger. They have to be stopped. You thought I was doing this because I liked you. Lantern's still warm. Hey, I see 'em! There they are. Okay. Cal, you and I'll stick to their tails. Dusty, you and Splitzer head north in case they cut across. Wh-where is Dusty? He was just in the barn with us. Dusty, where are you? Go find him. Talk to me. Trigger, it's Tyson. We just spotted the black Ranger and the girl. They're about a mile ahead of us. About a half a mile from Bridgeton. What about Walker? Walker's not with 'em. Well, did you get him? No, we didn't get him. Actually, I think he's getting us. What is going on out there, Tyson? While we been tracking him, I think he's been tracking us. He's been taking us out one by one. Well, you find him and you kill him! We'll head the others off at Bridgeton. You just take out Walker. Take care of him. We can't even see him. I thought I told you two skunks to go do something. Go cut him down. You cut him down. I'm out of here. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why are we running? There's three of us and only one of him. No. There's two of us and one of him, and that's why I'm running. Is he still behind us? Oh, God. He's not gonna help ya. Come on. Hey! Oh, man, am I glad to see you. I got this witness that's got to get to New Orleans. Don't even think about it! All right. Hand me your weapon. Two fingers. Last deputy retired suddenly. Let's do 'em now. No. Save 'em for Trigger. He'll be back any minute. All right, in the cell. In the cell. Well, well. You know what? It is just a shame... I gotta do you, before I've even had the chance to sample the goods. How about it, Axel? Is she as good as she looks? Hm. Don't even think about it. Bye-bye, baby. This is for Elton Jenner. Remember him? I do. New Orleans, here I come. Yeah. You know, we made so many stops on this journey. We got one more. Who's this? Hello? Who's there? Can I help you? Evening, Miss Prather. Are you lost? Oh. Katherine. It's Katherine. My... My baby. Lord, you done answered my prayers. It's Katherine. Grandma. Let me look at you. Oh, Katherine, is you hurt? No, I'm fine. You know, Katt was asking me why we do what we do. I told her it was because I hate bullies. But I think this is why we really do it, huh? Yeah. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. ♪ Treat me Like a fool ♪ Fourth time's the charm, Hoss. Oh, thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Good luck, honey. Thank you. Okay, come on, girls! Come on! That means you, Alex. You're single. What's the matter, chicken? Remember, I'm a great outfielder in softball. Guys, if she doesn't want to go out... Come on, Alex, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Is everybody ready? Okay. Oh! Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! Get them 20 horses ready, son.
