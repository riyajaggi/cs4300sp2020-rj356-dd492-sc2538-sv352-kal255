 Whoa, now, whoa, now. Hey, steady, now. And now to chute number four, riding Diablo Loco, Cordell Walker. That's a big knot. You got it. Grab it. There you go. That's it. Hey, good ride, Cordell. Hey, got Diablo there, huh? Guess that's supposed to be a good ride, huh? Good enough for first place. One hell of a way to spend a day off, boy.

 Heh. I can't think of a better way. I can think of a million better ways. Yeah, all starting with girls. Here. Carry this. Hey, how much money you win? Oh, there he is! Would you sign... Can I have your autograph, please? Oh. You did so good in the rodeo. Oh, uh, girls, this is my partner, Ranger Trivette. Hi. Hi.

 Do you ride broncs, too? N-No. I, um... Oh, Walker. When are you riding again, Walker? Oh, soon. Soon? Mm-hm. Are you married, Cordell? Thank you. Let me ask you something, and be honest, all right? What? How hard is it? How hard is what? H-How difficult is it to ride one of those wild animals? Heh-heh. Well, you have to learn how to ride a tame one first. No, I'm serious. Well, I'm serious too. Well, how long would it take? Ought to be about time. Yep. Any minute now. What's wrong with that picture? Uh, the ugly clown's got his nose on crooked. No, the bull riding is going on right now. So? So, what are two rodeo clowns doing out here? Okay, let's do it. Let's go. Our day off just ended. Come on! Get out! Get him out of there! Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Texas Rangers! Freeze! Come on, man! Drop that gun! Load it up. Let's get out of here. I got this. You're under arrest. Now, settle down. No, you settle... Yes! MAN 2: All right, Walker. You guys all right? BOTH: Yeah. Sometimes it doesn't pay to clown around, huh? Yeah, yeah, I'm gettin' this, guys. You think I'm gettin' it? Giddyup. You made the papers again. That so? Yup. They spell my name right this time? Nope, you're not even mentioned. What do you mean, I'm not mentioned? This isn't about that armored car heist. Those reporters are so used to Walker doing these things, they don't even bother. This is about him donating his rodeo winnings to the wildlife rescue center. You gave that $10,000 to a bunch of chipmunks? I like chipmunks. You still got the buckle, though, right? No, the buckle is going to a real special little guy. Washoe. Frances Clancey. Okay, thanks, Uncle Ray. Hold the reins, C.D. Hey, wa... Don't give it to him. You'll be okay. No, I'll wait till you get back. Just stay in the saddle. Jimmy, lets get this show on the road. Uh, okay, walk me easy. Oh, yeah, if you gonna ride rodeo, partner, you got to ride rodeo. If you're gonna be a bear, you might as well be a grizzly! Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Walker. Look, I'm really sorry to bother you. I mean, you've done so much for us and all. That's all right, Frances. What's wrong? Well, I-I'm worried about Billy. See, he didn't come home from work last night, and, well, it was our anniversary. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, I know. I made a special dinner and everything. Is this the first time he's done something like that? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. It ain't... It ain't like Billy at all. I'll be right over. No. No, Mr. Walker, don't. That's okay, don't... Don't worry about it. I know you're really busy and everything. Oh, that's okay, Frances. I was coming over anyway. I have something for little Billy. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Bye. Ow, ow, ow. C.D.! C.D.! Where's Billy? I don't know. Who are you? What do you want? Billy! Where's your puke of a husband? No. Stop it. Please, he ain't here. Where the hell is he? Don't you touch my kid! Don't you touch him! You got 10 seconds to tell me where Billy is. I don't know where he is! I don't... Oh! You okay, Frances? Yes. Thank God you're here. Uncle Cordell! I don't think I would do that. I'm just reachin' for my badge. Badge? Let's see it, real slow. "David Kilmer, State Department of Corrections." Parole officer? I was doing my job when you butted in. I didn't know the state hired men who ransack private property and terrorize innocent people. I was searching the place and questioning a witness. Well within my authority. I'd say you exceeded your authority. Well, from what I understand, you don't use a lot of "please" and "thank you" in your line of business. My line of business is criminals, not women and children. Different rules apply in my game. I deal with the scum of the earth. Eight out of 10 wind up back inside, and it's my job to hook 'em up. You never know when there's a shotgun waitin' beside the door. Billy Clancey's going straight now. Heh. Yeah, aren't they all? What are you doing here? Billy didn't show up for work last night. I came to get him. He's going back to the joint. Missing a shift is no reason to revoke his parole. Yeah, well, he tested dirty for drugs too. That's a lie, Billy don't use drugs. Yeah? I got a lab report says otherwise. If he comes to see you, you have him give me a call, hear? It'll be a lot easier on him if I don't come after him. And I'll expect you to stay the hell out of my jurisdiction. Next time, I won't be blindsided. If there is a next time, I won't have to. Billy was really hot back then, winnin' one race after another. But then at Altamont Speedway, his car went off the track at 120 miles per hour, and, well, his career was pretty much over. He still walks with a limp. Really? Yeah. It was downhill after that. We was broke. Billy couldn't get work, and sometimes we didn't even eat. You know, he was desperate. So, what did Billy wind up doing? Well, the blackest day of his life was when he drove the getaway car in a bank job that went sour. Let me guess. It was Walker that showed up. Yes, sir. Took down the gang single-handed, right? That's right. Why doesn't that surprise me? Look, Ranger Trivette, my husband is a good man. He's a victim of circumstances. I think Ranger Walker saw that. That's why he convinced Billy to turn state's evidence and helped him get a lighter sentence. When Billy came up on parole, Walker was right there vouchin' for him. So, what's Billy doing now? He's a delivery truck driver for the Lone Eagle liquor warehouse. Walker got him the job. That was about, uh, four months ago. I checked at all the hospitals. Nothing. Oh, thank God. Frances, you have any idea what would make him stay away from home? No, no. Everything's fine. I mean, I did notice about three weeks ago Billy started gettin' kind of moody. I tried to find out what was wrong, but he wouldn't say. Look, I want you and Junior to stay at my ranch until I locate Billy and find out what's going on. Thank you. Oh, I almost forgot something. Look what you won yesterday. Thanks, Uncle Cordell. Mom, look what I won. Yeah. That's great, huh? Hey, let's try it on. You like that. Huh? You like it? Kilmer had no right barging in like that. I didn't say it was right, Walker, but it is the law. Ex-cons are wards of the state until they're released from parole. The legal safeguards that you and I enjoy just don't apply to them. A parole officer can go in and search them or their premises any time, any place, without a warrant. Billy doesn't do drugs. It doesn't matter. What do you mean, "It doesn't matter"? Kilmer can send him back to prison for spitting on the sidewalk if he wants. He holds Billy's freedom in the palm of his hand. Like God, huh? Like God. Who is this guy, anyway? He used to be a cop. He got kicked off the force for brutality, caught on with Corrections last year as a parole agent. Why would they hire a guy like that? Listen, there are two kinds of parole officers. The ones who come out of civil service who believe they can make a difference, and then ex-cops, the ex-prison guards who are usually assigned to the hard-core, non-repentant. They're expected to wield a heavy hammer. Think whatever you want, Alex, but there's something about this guy. Just let him do his job, Walker. Something else: If you do find Billy Clancey, and he hasn't committed a new crime, you are duty-bound to turn him over to his parole officer. Don't hold your breath. I didn't hear that. Can we turn our attention to current business? I still haven't gotten the paperwork yet on yesterday's attempted armored car heist. It's in the mail. Cute. I have two people in jail. I'd like to press charges before their 72 hours are up. Also, the man who escaped yesterday got away with $20,000. Maybe you could question those two prisoners and see who that fourth man was. It's pretty much our only chance of getting that money back. Walker, I know you went out on a limb for Billy. I'm sorry it didn't work out. Doesn't the law say that you're innocent until proven guilty, counselor? Just want a couple smokes. Oh, yeah, forget it, man. Go on, man, give it to him. You already owe me. Shut your cheap mouth. Hey, somebody's comin' in. Yeah? Who is it? Look who's here. Well, Walker. Got a lot of friends in here, partner. I met a few of 'em once or twice. Go home, Walker! Get out of here! Cut him down. Open seven! Where's Hyde? Behind you. Who did this, Hyde? He, uh... He did it himself. How can he hang himself with only one working arm? Who got away in that pickup? What pickup? Who are you afraid of, Hyde? The guy that hung your buddy? I'm not tellin' you guys squat. Who was the last one to see Pellam? He only had one visitor since he was admitted. Who? His parole officer, Dave Kilmer. Remember when you said, "What's wrong with this picture?" Yeah. How does a guy in a thankless, low-paying job afford a, what, $3,000 suit and a $50,000 car? Rich girlfriend? Yeah, right. Thanks, bud. That's right. Look at you, my little black friend. Come and see me. I ain't seen him in a couple weeks. This guy's right, man. Come on. Come on, man. Get on, man. What you been up to? Well, hey, hey. That's not the way you... What you doin' here, Walker? Well, well, well. Mr. Walker. Long time no see. Seems like only yesterday, Grundy. Excuse me. Y-You all right, man? Nice try. Gentlemen, how may I help you? One of your parolees hung himself in county jail yesterday. Pellam. You don't say? I do say. He was part of that attempted armored car heist yesterday. You know, I'm really puzzled here. How could a guy hang himself with one good arm? I haven't got a clue. Well, we checked. And another robber, Max Hyde, is also one of your parolees. And so is the DOA. Roy Custer. I just put his jacket in the outgoing file. You keep it up, Walker. You're lightenin' my caseload. Well, the odds are the guy that got away in the pickup was one of yours too, and he got away with 20 grand. What's so funny? You're probably right. You're standing 10 feet away from where... most of the crimes committed in this county are hatched. You have all the answers, don't you? I try. I want Billy Clancey's file. It's been filed. I don't know what your game is, Kilmer, but I'm gonna find out. That'll cost you another 50. Hey... Kilmer. I want my money. What money? You got away with 20 grand. Oh, that money. Uh, I meant to give it to you... Give it to me now! I plan the perfect job and you blow it. You forgot to mention the part about the Texas Rangers showin' up. Ugh! Don't you smart-mouth me. And it better all be there. It is. Honest. Except for the 50 I gave to Bambi. Hey, I worked hard for that. You... Don't ever cross me again. Now, you're gonna tell me where Billy Clancey is, 'cause if you don't... If he doesn't, what? He'll be harboring a parole jumper. That's against the law. Are you done with your questioning, Kilmer? Yeah. Good. Heh. Thanks a lot, man. That's all right. Do you have any idea where Billy is? No, like I said, me and Billy wasn't that close. You had to have talked about something. Yeah, well, we did. What did you talk about? Mostly about huntin'. I was tryin' to talk Billy into goin' out with me as soon as the season opens next week. Where do you hunt? I got me a little shack down on the north fork of the Brazos. The Brazos? That's pheasant country. Oh, I don't shoot birds. Javelina pig's my game. Okay, thanks a lot. Billy's a nice guy. I hope he ain't in no trouble. I wish I could figure out why Billy's running. Well, if Farley told Billy where the cabin was, maybe he headed there. So how are we gonna go find him? Well, javelinas stick pretty much to the scrub brush. That would be Palo Pinto. Follow 'em. If they find the kid, kill 'em all. You got it, Mr. K. You do this for me, Quint, and I'll cut you loose from parole. That's my kind of incentive. Billy! Billy Clancey! It's Walker. Might not be Farley's cabin. Let's find out. What is it? "To Frances, with all my love, Billy." Anniversary present? Yeah, that means he's around here somewhere. Let's go find him. Billy? Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Go ahead. Just get it over with. Turn around. Turn around. Why would I want to do that? Well, didn't Kilmer send you? Mr. Walker. Hello, Billy. Come on, we got to talk. Frances was so happy when I got out. She figured life finally cut us a break. Well, it did, but, uh, all the breaks were bad. I might've had a chance, but I caught the wrong parole officer. Dave Kilmer? Yeah... "Crime Wave" Dave. "Crime Wave" Dave? Yeah, that's what his ex-cons call him. To stay on his good side, they have to pull jobs for him. He gets them jobs where they deal with a lot of cash, and then they case the place for him, and then he puts together a team from his caseload and they take the place down. Truck hijackings, bank robberies, armored car heists, you name it. You gotta be puttin' me on. If they don't go along with it, or if they cross him, he revokes their parole and sends them back to the joint. He wanted me to take down the Lone Eagle liquor warehouse. I hope to God you can prove this. That's why I didn't go to Mr. Walker in the first place. I... It's only my word against his. And you know how they listen to ex-cons. Besides, uh... I'm scared to death that Kilmer's gonna do somethin' to Frances and Junior. They're out at my ranch. They're okay. Kilmer always stays in the background, right? Yeah. No, he don't get dirty. I hear he has a warehouse full of stuff from his jobs. Trucks it across the border and sells it on the black market in Mexico. Why didn't you come to me, Billy? I know I let you down, Mr. Walker, and I feel terrible about it. You didn't let me down, Billy. If you'd gone with Kilmer, you'd have let me down. Where are you going? I'll be right back. Yeah, Walker got to him first. Little dirtbag's spillin' his guts. Walker knows everything. You're not helping me, Quint. Well, here's something that might be of some use to ya. Walker's got Clancey's family stashed at his ranch. I want it to end out there. Kill Clancey, Walker, and his partner Tonto. Whatever you say, Mr. K., but it's gonna cost you big. Don't squeeze me, Quint. It'll cost you five years if you do. Texas Ranger. Drop the rifle. Man! You scared me, Ranger. I mean, what's wrong, anyway? I'm just out here huntin' some pig. What were you doing, calling them in by phone? Don't think of it, now. I told you he'd come for me. Just stay put. Just... Settle down, or I'll hurt ya. How'd you spot him? The glint off the phone. Did Kilmer send you after Billy? Who's Kilmer? Probably your parole officer. I don't know any Kilmer, and who the hell's Billy? I told you, I was huntin' pig. He was talkin' on this? Yeah. Maybe the redial button will tell us who he called last. Livin' in the 20th century pays off, occasionally. Parole office. Kilmer. Kilmer. I must've dialed the wrong number. Sure, you did. Hello, Kilmer. Who's this? Walker. What do you want? Do you have a parolee named Quint? Yeah. What about it? He just tried to take out Billy Clancey. Doesn't surprise me. There was bad blood between him and Billy. Went back to the joint. Is that why he just called you? My parolees are always checkin' in with me. Just before they commit a crime? Yeah. Sometimes. I guess they think it's funny. In fact, I was about to revoke Quint's parole. I'm glad you caught him. Saved me the trouble. Your trouble is just beginning, pal. So, what do we got here, now? What we've got is a guy running a robbery ring right from his desk. You think it's Kilmer that's responsible for this crime wave that's grippin' Dallas for the last six months? I'd bet on it. Come here. Dang it, he's gone. This is gonna get ugly. It's like I told you, Chief Billy, if you hold open your hands, life will come to you. Uncle Cordell! Hiya, pal. Did you find my daddy? Yeah, I sure did. We talked. Whoa! Look at that. Uh, where is he? Uh... I'm not really sure right now, Frances, but... he wanted you to know that he still loves ya and that everything's fine. He'll explain everything to you as soon as he can. Oh, meanwhile, he wanted me to give you this. Oh. Oh... Ahh! Very pretty. Billy bought this? Yeah, he sure did. He hopes you like it. Oh, I do. I just wish that he would come home. He will, Frances. As soon as he can. Hey, Walker, let me ask you something. What the devil is he doing? How much rosin am I supposed to put on this glove? You don't wear a glove. I knew that. Oh, you wear a glove for bareback riding. Right. "Harmony with Horses"? Look, do I have everything I need for bronc riding? Right? Well, you could use a jock strap. I got these. Oh, man. Uh, look, can we get back to business? We've gotta find Billy and get him to the DA. We gotta do more than that. We got a con's word against Kilmer's, we got no crime committed, so that's gonna be pretty tough to file. Yeah. These are cutting horse spurs. You know, all we've gotta do is find some of Kilmer's cons and get them to talk. I don't see how. You saw the fear in their eyes. I can't believe how bold Kilmer is. I really think he thinks he's untouchable. Yeah, but he's gotta be getting nervous right now. What do you think their next move is? Oh, he's gonna try to get to Billy. Or his family. What do you think? Uncle Ray! I got the house. Okay. What happened? I'm sorry, Washoe. I didn't see a thing. Only stars that weren't made in heaven. Just take it easy, I'll get you to a hospital. No hospital. People die there. There's nobody here. Do you know where Frances and little Billy are? No. I didn't see a thing. I didn't see them. I'm sorry I ran out on you, Mr. Walker. I panicked. Where's Frances? Where's Junior? They're gone, Billy. Where'd they go? We think one of Kilmer's goon squads took 'em. Oh, Lord. Are you sure you're okay, Uncle Ray? I'll be all right. You go ahead. Come on, Trivette. Come on, Billy. Where are we goin'? To the DA. You're gonna tell your story. I know Billy's story won't convict Kilmer, but at least we can arrest and indict him. And that's all I need right now, Alex. All right, Walker, I'll listen. Tell her your story. I made it all up. Excuse me? I made it all up. Come on, Billy. See, the truth is, um... I got too drunk to go to work, and I was ashamed to tell Frances, so I took off. Don't do this. I know that you're mad at me for lying, Mr. Walker, but I think the best thing I can do right now is turn myself in to my parole officer and face the music. Billy... look at me. Look at me. Why are you doing this? Because I have to. Can I go now? You've committed no crime that I know of, and the parole office hasn't filed a parole violation, so... yes, you're free to go. He's a friend of yours? Why would he lie? I'm gonna find out. Billy! Come here. What do you think you're doing? It's the only way to save Frances and my boy. If you go back to Kilmer's office, he's gonna send you to prison. Maybe, but they'll live. How do you know that? He's not gonna leave any witnesses. I don't have any other choice. I know you're scared, but I can help ya if you'll come back and tell the truth. Thank you, Mr. Walker, but... I gotta turn it around by myself. I mean, Kilmer's got Frances and Junior. I've let them down in the past and I'm not about to do it again. I do thank you for all you've done, but the rest is up to me. And the rest is up to him? That's what he said. You'd think he'd know better by now. Well, the kid's scared. He has no faith in the system anymore. No wonder, having a parole officer like David Kilmer. I tell ya, that guy's beginnin' to get on my nerves. I mean, we're stuck. Right? He's got us sittin' here. We gotta stop this thing before it gets any further out of hand. Well, I love my job, but... Sometimes I-I wish I didn't have to uphold the law. Yeah, sometimes I do wish that. I know how you feel. But fortunately... that's the way we are. Let's hit the road. I think better when I'm driving. I hear you wanna see me. I know Billy thinks he's doing the right thing, but if we're gonna keep him out of prison, we're gonna have to work this from another angle. Frances and Billy Jr.? Yeah. All we gotta do is find out where Kilmer's got 'em stashed. What about the warehouse Billy was talking about? How we gonna find it? Talk to one of Kilmer's cons. Right behind you. I'm gonna tell you what, Trivette, if anything happens to that little boy, there won't be a hole deep enough for Kilmer to hide in. Yo, Walker. You got no reason to roust me, man! I'm gonna ask you once... nicely. Where's Billy Clancey's wife and kid? Hey, man, I don't know what you're talkin' about. Okay. Trivette. What's in the bag? What does it sound like? Hear you're afraid of snakes. Oh, hey... Hey, man, you're crazy. We've been told that. No! No! Trivette, how long does it take for someone to die from a snakebite? Couple, two, three hours. But I hear it's really painful. Yeah, that's what I hear, I hear you start swelling all up, your neck starts to swell, where you can't breathe, and you start choking, going "ugh", "ugh", "ugh"... That's what I hear. - Yeah. Grundy. Turn around here. For the last time, where is Billy Clancey's wife and kid? Man, you know I can't tell ya. Kilmer'll kill me! You're gonna die anyway. Put the sack on his head. No! No! Wait! Wait! They're in a warehouse at 6th and Main! Just take it away! Let's go. No! No, leave it in the bag! Leave it in the bag! Oh, man! Grraah! You said you'd let them walk out if I came with you. And you were dumb enough to believe me. You're goin' south in the next shipment. Only, you won't be alive to enjoy the trip. I'm sorry, baby. The door! Hey! Door! Check it out. Come on! Other side! What do you got? It's rigged! Behind the grate. Come with me. - It's Walker! Come on! Come with me! Come on, men. Untie your son. Take him, man. I'm going around the back side! I've got a bead on him! If you see him, you take him down! He's in the corner! Remember me? You said next time I won't blindside you, Kilmer? You'll see this one coming. Well, maybe not. Don't! Billy! Oh, God, please be okay. Daddy? Daddy? All right, yeah! Happy anniversary! Happy number seven! Baked it up myself. Oh, sure you did. Ahem. Shall we blow out the candles? Yeah? Okay. Ready? Go! All right, all right! All right... Billy's testimony did the trick. The grand jury just indicted Kilmer. Oh... Oh! Did you tell him yet? No, I haven't told him yet. Walker got you released from your parole. Oh, Walker. And you got your job back. All right, enough of that. Cut the cake. Come on. Someone's hungry. Okay. Okay! All right! Okay, Walker, let her go. You sure? Yeah. Rock and roll, man. Okay. Giddyup. All right, James. Heh. Yeah. Heh-heh. Giddyup! That's right, that's right. Giddyup. Jimmy... You got to show the horse who's boss! Aah! Hyah! Hyah! Oh... my... God! Walker! Somebody! Somebody! Please! Walker! Somebody! Somebody! Please! Walker!
