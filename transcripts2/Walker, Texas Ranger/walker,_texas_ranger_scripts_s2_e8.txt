 Rubin, you're gonna have enough money to buy any woman you want. And you thought this deal wouldn't go down. Well, you boys should've listened to him. What the...? Who the hell are you? Walker, Texas Ranger. Well, you boys made two big mistakes. One: smuggling drugs. And two: doing it in Texas. Didn't you boys know the Texas Rangers would be coming down on you? Hm? Oh, yeah? Where the hell are they? Well, you're looking at him. You saying you're here alone? That's what I'm sayin'. I want you boys to listen up real careful. You have the right to remain silent. And you have the right to stuff it. Oh! Shut up, Billy Joe. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Old blind hog found him an acorn! Yes, sirree, take a look at this old gal. Let me see. "All my friends say I'm statuesque and have a..." "Naughty smile." What'd I tell you, huh? Huh? Computer bulletin boards are the wave of the future. Absolutely, Jimmy. Absolutely. "My idea of a good..." What's the news? Well, Alex is pushing hard for the judge not to set bail, but the chances are, Billy Joe McArthur's gonna walk right out of this arraignment. Well, you done the best you could, son. Come on over here and take a look at this thing. This thing is amazing. It'll get your mind off McArthur. I got a date on this sucker. Yep, old Jimmy set it up. Cordell, do you know these things are run on telephone wires? Yes, sir, telephone wires. Seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a date, C.D. Some of us don't have the pick of the litter, Cordell. We have to take other measures. Oh, this one's looking pretty good to me. Yep. She and I are gonna have lunch, and she's gonna wear a red dress. But the question is, what's gonna be in that red dress? Cordell, details. Details. Ranger Walker. Oh, hi, Evie. I... I'm sorry, Walker. Bail was set, and McArthur was ready for him. I tired to get the judge to make it higher, but you know the drill. Does the judge know what's gonna happen? Billy Joe's gonna be out of the state before he even gets his robe off. I used every argument I could think of. Your testimony was terrific. Mwah. Top of the mornin' to you, Ranger. Seems like as long as I've been doing this, I'd stop taking it all so personally. Just a statement real quick about how it feels to be set free. - I - feel great about it. Yo, Walker! Yeah, remind me, will ya? Now, didn't I tell you it'd be a whole lot harder for you to put me away than it would be for me to get out? I love this court system. Next time you'll get a judge who believes in justice. You won't get me next time. Don't count on it. Seems nowadays every damn criminal loves this court system. Uh, Ranger Walker? I'm sorry to interrupt you. Just, uh... A messenger came by this afternoon, brought this for you. I just figured you oughta get it right away. He seemed to think it was pretty important. Thanks, Evie. See you in church, Ranger! I'm just so glad I caught you, 'cause he seemed to think you should get it right away. You okay? Yeah. Check them. You okay? I think... I think I'm okay. I... You're fine. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Maybe you should go to the hospital. No, I'm okay. Just to get it looked at. The medic just looked at it. I'm okay, Alex. You're so stubborn. So have you ever heard of this Ranger Bodine? No. Whoever he is, he's no Texas Ranger. Whoever he is, he doesn't care who he kills or hurts in the process. Let me ask you somethin'. You think this guy just had a thing for Billy Joe? No. He addressed the envelope to me. Whatever he wants, it's personal. Let's get out of here. Come on. Bring it up. Bring it up. Come on, three more. Come on. Come on. Last one. Last one. Bring it home. Come on. Hi. Okay, I've gone back 30 years, and I found five Rangers named Bodine. Now, four of them are dead, and the other lives in Plainview with his daughter. None of them are named Samuel. I guess that doesn't surprise me. Okay, Evie, I want you to go back and check all applications for the Rangers and the sheriff's department. Go back a couple of years. Um, did you want me to do that now? I... I mean, tonight? Is there a problem? What's the matter, Evie? Uh... Um, it's just that, um, Tommy was gonna call me, and... Tommy? I love it. Evie's got a boyfriend. Yeah, I knew you had it in you, girl. Oh... He's not my boyfriend. I mean, he sure likes me, but I don't know why. Hey, hey, what kind of talk is that? He likes you 'cause you're a great gal. You need a little confidence booster, girl. Who sent you the rose? He sent it to me. Look... Okay. I'll make a deal with you. If you'll work on this Bodine case for two more hours, if Tommy calls, you can take off early, okay? Okay, great. Oh, oh, oh, almost forgot, with all the excitement and everything. A new warrant came for you this afternoon. Well, I'll be. Petey Cevera. Who's Petey Cevera? Do you remember a couple of years ago there was this family named Carver, who was wiped out in what they thought was a drug war? Is that the one where the guys went to the wrong house? That's the one. Well, Petey Cevera was the one that set up the hit, and then he disappeared afterwards without a trace. Until now. Till now. Why don't you go around back. All right. I'll be at the front. Don't make a move till I get there. ♪ If you wanna be strong ♪ ♪ Don't wanna be judged ♪ ♪ If you wanna be happy ♪ ♪ Don't wanna be sad ♪ ♪ If you wanna be my girl Make me glad ♪ Hey, where you think you goin'? Can't you see this badge? Yeah, we've seen that before. I gotta admit, it's a great gimmick, but get your butt back to the end of the line. Oh! Hey. Now, you two stay there. And don't move. Anybody ever heard of fire laws? ♪ To make you mine ♪ Excuse me. Do you know where I can find Petey Cevera? Thank you. Hey, you can't go in there. Texas Rangers. Official business. Just... Didn't you hear me? Petey Cevera. I have a warrant for your arrest. Come along quietly. I'm not going anywhere with you quietly. Walker. ♪ To make you mine ♪ ♪ What can I say To make you mine? ♪ I'm sorry. Are you all right? Trivette, that's Petey Cevera! Good job, partner. Okay, let's go. Now, I wonder how long he wants us to stay down here. Hey, Ranger. Can we get up now? Yeah, sure. Oh! Did you see where it came from? There he is. Something troubling you, Washoe? There's a shadow over the moon tonight. Can you see it? No. Look more closely. A shadow isn't always a shadow. What is obvious is sometimes hidden in plain view. Washoe? Yes, I see it. Keep lookin'. It will disappear as quickly as it has come. Hey, this looks like a good truck to steal. Yeah. MAN 2: Go on, take it. He needs the key. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell you... Yeah, go on, get it! Get it! What's the matter? What is it now? What, no car alarm? What arrogance, man. If we can take a look at this, I'd like to get some copies of this. Texas Rangers, Company B. Thank you. Hey, good-lookin', what's cookin'? Hi, Gerard. You change your hair or something? You look... different. Is there something that I can help you with this morning? Oh, yeah, uh, Mac said I'm supposed to give you this. Oh, right, the files. It's okay, I'll just take it. Isn't that it? Yeah. All right. Well, I'll see you later, then. Okay, yeah. Um, sure. You, uh... You gonna be at C.D.'s after work? Mm... Gee, I don't know. Um... maybe. I'll see if... I'll see if maybe my... My boyfriend and I'll stop by. I'll see you, then. Since the DMV came up empty on Texas, I'm gonna try Louisiana and Oklahoma, all right? Good idea. Evie, is there any word on the, uh... On the, uh... Wow. Holy mackerel. Is that...? Y-you look, uh... different. So, what do you think? You look absolutely stunning. Really? Now... Now, I... I can certainly go home and change at lunch. No, don't change a thing. Believe me. You mean it? Mm-hm. What was I gonna ask you? Um... Oh, yeah, about the applications for the Rangers. Any word on those? Not so far, but I'm working on it. Okay. More flowers? Yeah. Tommy sent 'em to me 'cause he couldn't make it last night. Isn't that sweet? That's 'cause you're my yellow rose of Texas. Come here, sugarplum. Mm! Uh, Tommy... Tommy Williams, this is Ranger... Walker. Walker. My pleasure. My pleasure. Evie's told me a lot about you. Likewise. Well, we're just going to get a bite to eat, if you care to join us. Uh, no, thanks. Maybe some other time. Have a good time. Yeah. Thank you. Well, you got everything? Yeah. I'm just gonna grab my bag. Okay. Watch the door, there. I'm hungry. Dadgum it. She ought to be here by now. Who's that? His computer date. Wave of the future. Will you relax? She'll be here. Maybe. Cynic. Hey... there's my date. See you after lunch. Am I late? No. Well, maybe yours is stuck in traffic, C.D. Well... No, no. That's not it. You know, I've got a successful business. Semi-retired Ranger. You know, a little status. I'll bet you that I have intimidated that little ol' gal. I didn't mean to, but I have. Yeah, I reckon. Damn it, I want you to quit ridin' me. Okay, I won't ride you, C.D. Ah! That man must be brain-dead. I keep hearing Texas Rangers are pretty tough. You heard right. C.D., aren't you gonna help him? No, there's just three of 'em. Besides, they need to learn some manners. Hey, take it easy! It's a joke. It's a joke. What do you mean, a joke? Your buddy. He said he wanted to have a little fun. He said he wanted to see how good his partner really was. Partner? Yeah, he's a Texas Ranger. He gave us $500 to come in here and roust you. He said you'd think it was funny. What's his partner's name? Ranger Trivette? Uh... No, Bodine. Ranger Bodine. Look, he... He said once you knew about it, it'd be okay. Okay, forget about it. What the hell is this all about? Bodine. Okay, everybody. Excitement's over. Drinks on the house. Yeah! Well, here comes my date. How do you know? She's got on a red dress. Yes, sir. Are you the man they call C.D.? Yes, I am. I thought we'd start out rather slowly so we could have a real quality, meaningful relationship, and... I... I think maybe we got our signals crossed. I'm just here to deliver this note. It's for a Ranger Walker. Oh, right here. If it's any consolation, though, I think you're real cute. Have a drink on the house, huh. Thanks. "I wanted to see if you were as tough as your reputation. "You look pretty good, but not good as me. Ranger Bodine." Where did you get this? Some guy handed it to me on my way in. Excuse me, young lady. What'd this guy look like? He's a tall, good-looking guy. He had on, uh, blue jeans... The only Ranger I ever knew named Bodine, his first name was Phil. And hell, he's been dead 20 years. You fellows ask me, you're... You're barking up the wrong tree if you're looking for a Ranger or anybody else named Bodine. That sucker just simply not gonna give you that much. You have to get in his boots. You're gonna have to think like he thinks if you're gonna find him. How did he know about Billy Joe and Petey Cevera? Inside information. Who knew about us going to pick up Petey Cevera last night? Us, Evie, the judge, Mabel Shoops. I guess we can safely eliminate the judge. Let's go see Mabel. Hi, Mabel. What does the sign say, Walker? We only need a couple minutes of your time. Well, maybe I haven't got a couple of minutes. Who knows at my age? Besides, I'm on my break. Look like you're workin' to me. Just makin' out my last will and testament. But don't worry. I'm not leaving you anything. I love it. There's actually a woman in Texas who doesn't go gaga every time she sees you. Wrong, cowboy. Broke my heart's what he done. What? All I wanted to do was take him to lunch. Yeah, in Acapulco. Well, can't blame an ol' gal for tryin', now, can ya? Ah, what the hey. What's up? You issued a warrant yesterday on a Petey Cevera? Indeed, I did. I hope you showed him what for too... I remember that case. It was all over the papers. Did anyone else know about the warrant? Oh, just that new Ranger. He was real excited when I gave him the word. What's his name? Well, come to think of it, he didn't tell me his name. He's awful cute, though. You better watch out, Walker. This one gonna give you a run for your money. Bodine? Did he know about Billy Joe McArthur? Oh, yeah, sure. I told him about that. When's the first time he came in, Mabel? Couple of weeks ago. Gave me a list of the people that y'all are on the lookout for. Then he asked me to give him advanced warning when the warrants were gonna be issued. Said he'd check with me. Well, he's just called me on the phone, and he's just come in that one time. When was the last time he came in? Well, just a couple minutes ago. You just missed him. What did he look like? Oh, big handsome guy. He had on a silver belly hat and a red shirt. And, uh... Hey. Down the stairs. Look out! Oh! Hey...? Uh, hey, what did I do? Let's go find out. Thank you very much. I hope it's successful. This the guy, Mabel? This ain't him. I told you the guy was handsome. Oh. No offense. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. You fit a description of a suspect. But the other guy was real handsome, huh? Yeah. County clerk. Yea... Sure. Sure, he's right here. It's for you. It's Ranger Bodine. Yeah. Close, Walker, but no kewpie doll. What'd he say? Evie. Evie. Anything yet on Bodine? Not so far. I was here till 10:00 last night, and I've been working on it all day. But I got access to the reject files from the academy. These are from the last couple years. Nothing? Okay. Why don't you check on anyone who has been arrested for impersonating a police officer. See if there's anything there. Evie, more flowers. He sends them to me every day. When did you meet Tommy? Um... A couple weeks ago. Where at? Right here in the office. What was he doing here? I don't know. He just kind of showed up at my desk, and he was real handsome and attractive and everything, and... And, uh, I was having some trouble with the hard drive on my computer, and he offered to fix it for me, and... Why? Just... care about you. Yeah. So... How does "Evie Williams" sound? Whoa, ha-ha-ha. Uh... yeah, right. Not gonna touch that. Check out this Tommy Williams. Oh, yeah, a few more sets. We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached... Anything? Zip. Well, Mabel issued a warrant on a Travis Sinclair. Never heard of him. A real nice guy. I'm looking forward to this one. Why don't you keep working on that thing there, and I'll go get him. All right. Travis Sinclair, I got a warrant for your arrest. Ease on back down there. That's it. Always thought Walker would come for me. After all this time bustin' my chops, don't tell me he's got something better to do. No, the, uh, department just thought you were too much for Walker. Ah... I thought he was their glory boy. So if I'm supposed to be too much for Walker, what can you do that he can't? Well, I'll have to show you. Good morning, Mrs. Williams. Yes. This is Ranger James Trivette. I need to know if you have a member of your club with the name Samuel, Sam or S. Bodine. Bodine... No, I don't show anything. Okay, thank you very much. You're welcome. Who the hell are you, Bodine? Excuse me? Oh, yes, ma'am, Texas Ranger. Well, you just let me know where those bad guys are. Right there. Now, you just freeze right there. Don't you move. Yeah? Well, if Walker can't do it, Bodine can. Well, hi. Hi. This is not a bad time, is it? No. This is a little bit of a surprise. I wasn't expecting to see you. Mm. I just couldn't wait to see my honey. Oh. You sure it's okay? Well, sure. Well, where we going? Well, you're in for the surprise of your life. Oh, I love surprises. Come on, heh. Come on there. I can hardly wait to get there. Got everything? All right. We'll have closure on this case. Mm-hm. Ranger's station. Come on. Yes, he is. May I ask who's calling? Come on. No, I did not. Yeah, I will. Evie! What is it? It's Williams. Williams. Evie's boyfriend is Bodine. I just saw them outside. Let's go. This guy's really obsessed with you, man. Howdy, Walker. Hey, Bodine. That's correct, my friend. You know, I just wanted to say, speaking to you like this is a real pleasure. My little heart's just going, "A-pitty-pat, pitty-pat." I got somebody I want you to give a big hello to. W-Walker, I'm... Please help me. I... I... I... I... I didn't know. I didn't know. He's crazy. You gotta help me. Please! Let her go, Bodine. She's hasn't done anything to you. Well, maybe I will, maybe I won't. You know these women. They like to run their mouth. Right now, Walker, I want you to meet me at the old factory on Main Street at midnight. That's 3922 Main Street. And one more thing, good buddy: you better be alone. He wants me to meet him alone. That's an obvious trap. You can't go there alone. He's got Evie. What choice do I have? Hey... partner. Walker. Trivette told me what you're planning to do. You cannot go after him alone. I have no choice. What is it with you macho Texas Rangers? Why do you have to turn everything into a life-or-death struggle? Bodine started it, not me. So what? It doesn't mean you have to finish it on his terms. Bodine is obsessed with proving that he's better than you, and is not gonna play by the rules. He wants to prove man-to-man that he's better than me. And that's his big mistake. How do you know that for sure? You're gonna get yourself killed because of your stupid, foolish pride. If I backed down every time a guy like Bodine entered my life, how would I live with myself? Look... You've got to understand. Every time I put on this badge, I've got to believe I'm making a difference. Who I am, what I am, a Ranger, is part of me. The best part of me. Look... The only part that makes... sense to me. Can you understand that? Yes, I know. But I just wish that... Shh. I wish... I wish I... I knew how to express myself better, to tell you how much... you mean to me, how special... you are to me, probably more than you'll ever know. Washoe. It's time. Don't you worry yourself none, Alex. Washoe's in good hands with the spirits. I couldn't bear to lose him. I know. Trivette. No. Louise, keep everybody off the line. Look more closely. What is obvious is sometimes hidden in plain view. I'm up here, Walker. Now, honey pie, I bet you're just glad to see him. I know he's glad to see you. Come on. Drop your weapon. Now, kick it over there. As you could see, I'm still doing your job for you. Case closed on Travis Sinclair. You're not doing my job for me, Bodine. I let the court decide their fate. Now, that right there is the root of your problem. You're too soft. You built your whole reputation up on a myth. That's why I'm here. To tell the world you're nothing but a fraud. I could've been a great Ranger. They told me I had aggressive tendencies. Imagine that. What the hell do they expect with all the garbage walking the streets out there? I told them, give me a chance. Just give me a chance to prove to them what I can do. And they wouldn't. No, sirree. They sure wouldn't. And now I'm going to have to prove it to you. Get up. After I kill you, Walker, I'll be the legend. Only in your mind. Come here. I'll be right there, Walker! Don't you go anywhere, cupcakes. Oh, what happened, Ranger? Huh? Hey, where'd you go? It's not over yet. Huh? Now it's over. You won't need this anymore. Hey, shh, shh. I was so scared. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I know, Evie. Shh. ♪ Some girls Got the small-town notion ♪ ♪ The way to catch a man Is with devotion... ♪ Drink this. It'll help you feel better. Uh, what is it? An old Indian remedy. It's sage tea. Probably the best drink ever invented. Thank you. I've got to get going. I gotta be in court early. You gonna be all right? Thanks. I'll walk you out. Go ahead. Drink it. It'll make you feel better. Thank you so much. Yeah. I hope she's gonna be all right. Yeah, me too. Excuse me, sir. You bet. Hi. Hi. Would you like to two-step? Oh, heh. I'm not real good at... At that.

It'll come to you. I'll just be damned if I can understand this. I had a date with this lady. Something happened to her car. We've rescheduled it. Now she's late again. Well, that's the wave of the future, C.D. Now, damn it, I don't want you starting again. Just don't ride me about this. C.D.? What can I get you, Mab...? Ma...? Mabel? Ooh. For heaven's sakes, a red dress. Oh, you can get me anything, 'cause tonight it's gonna be you and me Oh, no, no, no, no... And party time till we drop! There's been a mistake. I couldn't believe it when you showed up on my computer. And the way you described yourself. I'm the biggest liar... Oh, I didn't know you had that kind of fire in your belly! I'm a liar, Mabel! I'll swear I am. I'm the damnedest liar in the world! Come on, honey, let's party! I don't... No. Somebody help me! Somebody help me! I'm no good for anybody! Somebody!
