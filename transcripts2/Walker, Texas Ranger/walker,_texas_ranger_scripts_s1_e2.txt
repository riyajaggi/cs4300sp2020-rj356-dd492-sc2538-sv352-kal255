 I better lead on this one. Why's that? This is a lady. We need a little finesse here. You come on with that squinty-eyed make-my-day stuff, she'll clam up. Trust me. I know women. Okay. You mean that? Sure. I'll take notes. And as if that wasn't enough, there's always his yacht, tucked away on a small island

 only miles from Mikonos, and measuring a mere 185 feet. This is luxury at its finest. Who the hell's that? I ain't expecting nobody. Ask who it is. Who is it? Texas Ranger, ma'am. Strip. What? I said strip. Sorry to barge in on you like this, Miss Mason. James Trivette, Texas Ranger. This is Ranger Walker. What you want?

 Ask you a couple questions if we may. About what? About Benny Carl Devlin. You used to be real close, didn't you, Miss Mason? I know him, yeah. I haven't seen him in two years. Look, I was just getting in the shower. I'm late for work already. So if you'll excuse me... Miss Mason, Devlin's wanted for the murder of a police officer. We'd appreciate cooperation, but if we have to... Easy, partner. Easy. The lady said that she hasn't seen the man. That's good enough for me. I don't wanna make you late for work, ma'am. There is just one little thing. I have a picture of Devlin. It's pretty old. The last time you saw him, did he look pretty much the same? Relax, Devlin. I don't want to hurt you. You already did. Could have killed you. How'd you know, man? I may not know much about women, Trivette, but I do know they don't put their makeup on before they take a shower. Much as I hate to admit it, the man is good. Yeah. Mr. Devlin, can I have a comment before you enter the courtroom? Please, Mr. Devlin. Just one comment. Please. Do you have any comment? You've just seen the accused killer, Benny Carl Devlin, and with us now is the assistant district attorney, Alex Cahill, who'll be responsible for his prosecution. Miss Cahill, can I have some comment from you, please? Mr. Devlin will stand trial for first-degree murder for the killing of off-duty police officer Douglas Garcia, who recognized Mr. Devlin as a fugitive from justice and was attempting to apprehend him. Officer Garcia was out of uniform at the time, but eyewitnesses will testify that he clearly identified himself as a police officer before he was shot. Office Garcia leaves behind a wife and four young children. We will make every effort to obtain the maximum conviction in this matter and will not rest until we accomplish it. I'm sorry I'm late. I had a deposition in Denton. If you still want to do my testimony... Can't. I gotta get to the stables. Amber's not acting right. You treat that horse just like a baby. She is my baby. She almost died when she was born, so, yeah, I suppose I do treat her like a baby. That's why I borrowed Uncle Ray. My uncle Ray? You always said he knew more about horses than most vets. Yeah, he does. So he's gonna take a look at Amber for me. Actually, he sounded really happy that I called. He didn't mention anything about grandchildren, did he? What's that supposed to mean? Never mind. If you want my testimony later, I'll be here. What about tomorrow morning? Breakfast. C.D.'s, 7:30? You're on. Allow me. Here you go, Miss Prosecutor. You won't be needing that Mace. I'm as harmless as a little old lamb. What do you want, Baker? Just to congratulate you. Assistant district attorney of Tarrant County. That's quite a honor. Makes me kind of proud, seeing as how it was me that launched your career. Really. Little gal right out of law school... takin' down a big old south Texas cowboy like me? That's big stuff. You can ride something like that a long way, and you sure as hell did. Is that all? One more thing. I just wanted you to know that every night while I was in prison, every night for the last 6 years, just before I went to sleep I thought about you. The way you looked in that courtroom. Them long perfect legs moving back and forth, strutting like they belonged to a $50 whore. I guess that thought's about the only thing that got me through my misery. All right, Baker, that's enough. You open your mouth one more time, I'll file harassment charges. I'll put you back in prison where you obviously still belong. Fort Worth's a little bitty place, darling. We'll be seeing each other again real soon. Thanks. You up for lunch? I'm up to my neck in paperwork. I'm gonna have to take you under my wing, Walker. Teach you the ABCs of organization. Look at that. What in the world is that? Computer watch. Adds, subtracts, multiplies, keeps 300 phone numbers and has a memo pad. Now, watch this. I'm now programming in my schedule for tomorrow. Why don't you just write it on a notepad. Because then I'd have to carry a telephone book to store the information it holds. Well, I think I'll stick to the old-fashioned way. I got shot at once while looking up a number. Phone book saved my life. You want some bad news? What? Somebody just saw Dewey Baker in town. I thought he was in Huntsville. Not anymore. He's out, and he's right here in Fort Worth. Yes. Yes, I know you don't like it, but you have no choice in the matter, do you? Horse bicarb and equine aspirin? That's it? That's it. Oh. I guess I was expecting some sort of mystical Cherokee potion. Maybe some ancient wisdom thrown in. The wisdom is in honoring the animal and helping it understand who's in charge. Swallow. Good. Good. Thanks. Just rub her sides and belly, down strokes, nice and easy, and she'll be fine. Okay. Hello, nephew. Hello, uncle. Walker, can't you learn to make noise like normal people? Sorry. Just a habit. How's Amber? Oh, it's just colic. She must have got some thistle in her belly, but she'll be fine. That's good. Well, I'll be getting back now. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Ah, you're welcome. Something up? Dewey Baker's in town. I know. He's already paid his respects. When? This afternoon at the parking garage. What'd he say? That I had nice legs and he thought about me a lot in prison. This isn't funny, Alex. The guy's dangerous. Walker, if I ran to you every time I got a threat, neither one of us would get very much work done, now, would we? He has no ties to this area except for you. So? So be careful. I will. I promise. But don't expect me to crumble because of a little sexual innuendo. The only thing that's important to me right now is the trial, putting Benny Carl Devlin on death row. Okay, tough guy, but I'm still gonna follow you home. I'm not going home. I have a date. The tennis pro? He has a name. I know. Timmy. Timothy. Timothy. Is that any worse than Cordell? No, Alexandra, I just have a problem with a grown man making a living in short pants, that's all. Alex? You in here? You behave. Down here, Timothy. Good night, girl. I'll see you tomorrow. Hello, Alex, dear. Oh. Hello, Ranger. Alex, I hope you brought an umbrella. It's gonna pour tonight. Where you taking her? Walker, that's none of your business. A man I put in prison hassled me today. My self-appointed guardian is worried about me. Well, don't lose any sleep over it, Mr. Ranger. She's in good hands. I've got a green belt in judo. Oh, green. Pretty color. Come on, Alex. Shoot. Did you find anything, Jamie? A real pro with the security system. Looks like he got in and out clean. Why don't you all take a break. Are you ok? Yeah. Can I put this stuff away? Yeah, sure. Feel free to say "I told you so." I'm just glad you're okay. Now, I want you to think. Hair, eyes, hands. Is there anything that you can remember? It was dark. He was behind me. Look, maybe it wasn't Baker. I've prosecuted a lot of other sickos. You know it was him, Alex, and he's sending you a message. And I think it's time you started listening. Do you know how far back these go? Two, three weeks. Exactly the time he's been here. Pretty thin. Not too thin for me. Where to? 2200 Pittman. See the paper this morning? Used to be decent people could sleep at night. Now the whole country's crawling with scum that ain't got no respect for the law. Whatever you say. Didn't used to be that way. I was sheriff over in Cuervo County for eight years. I got results. The crime rate's never been lower. That right? Yep. 2200 Pittman? You sure about that address? Park behind the dumpster. Anything you say, Ranger. Turn it off. Hands on your head. You know the procedure. Out. Cordell Walker. The Ranger's Ranger. You didn't really expect to fool anybody, did you? Assume it. Ooh, I'll be a son of a gun. Look what we got here. A Buffalo Ranger. Keep it up, Baker. This is one buffalo that could trample your stupid face. Careful, now. Use of force. You might end up in prison, just like I did. Where were you last night? I don't have to answer that. You don't have to answer anything, Baker. I'll take you straight to jail. What's so special about last night? You tell us. I was working. Where were you between 9 and 10? DFW. Picked up a fare in Bluff View a little after 9. He had a 10:30 flight. It's all in the logbook, right there on the front seat. Where's your camera? I don't have one. Open your trunk. You got probable cause? Broken taillight. That good enough for ya? I like you, Walker. A lawman that ain't afraid to improvise. You and me, we cut out of the same cloth. I know all about you, Baker. I don't like you. You're nothing but a sadistic bully who hid behind his badge. Texas Rangers. You clowns wouldn't last five minutes where I come from. Save it, Baker. Just open the damn trunk. Golly gee. No camera. What a disappointment. We will check this out, and your apartment, and everything else about you. In the meantime, here's a restraining order. You come within 300 yards of Alex Cahill, I'll put you back in Huntsville so fast, you won't even know what happened. If you've got a problem, Walker, it's in your head. Why would I want to harm a pretty little thing like that? She changed my whole life around. Besides, if I wanted to hurt anybody, I could do it from a lot farther than 300 yards. Don't even think of it. What's going on? I'm under surveillance and they think I don't know it. That's where you come in, isn't it, little buddy? I'll help you, Dewey. Didn't I always say it when we was cellmates together? That I'd help ya? Wipe your mouth. You got spittle on it. Okay, now, I'm gonna bail out, and I want you to drive around for about an hour and then ditch this thing. We'll meet tomorrow just like I planned. Walker? I checked out Baker's story. The guy's wife said he was picked up at 10 after 9, but that she didn't see who the driver was. Now, he's coming back tomorrow morning. I'm gonna meet him at the airport and I'm gonna show him a mug shot of Baker. What do you think you're doing? I'm staying here tonight. Absolutely not. Look, I've got Baker under surveillance, but you're not safe until he's put away. Walker, I appreciate your concern, but let me ask you something: If I were a man, would you come out here and thrown down your dusty sleeping bag? Alex, I've known at least a dozen DAs out of your office, and believe me, if Dewey Baker was after any one of them, they'd be running for the nearest telephone to call the National Guard. But you gotta be tougher than any man, right, Alex? Look, if I have to, I'll sleep out on the porch, but you're not staying alone tonight. I'll get it. I'll get it. Walker... No, no. Oh, boy. I couldn't remember whether you said Grigio or chardonnay, so I bought 'em both. What's he doing here? I dropped by to see if you were wearing your green belt. Ma chéri, pour toi. Mm. Ooh. Et moi. Sure you won't have any wine, Walker? Maybe... one for the road? You'll be leaving before I will, Timmy. And I don't drink on duty. Get down. Freeze! Walker, you take it easy? How'd you know I was out here? I felt the ground shaking. Ha. Funny. What the hell are you here, Trivette? I could ask you the same question. I asked you first. Okay. I'm moonlighting, I'm selling magazines. I just need two more subscriptions for this Hawaiian vacation on a cruise ship with a thousand dentists from Minneapolis. Funny. Hello? What happened? Somebody killed my horse. Amber's dead. Someone killed Amber. How could anyone do a thing like that? Baker's capable of doing anything. I should've listened to you. You're right about me, you know. Too stubborn for my own good. That's not a bad thing to be. Sometimes. It's the way I grew up. I had to scratch for everything that I had. My education. My law degree. My clothes. Sometimes even the food I ate. Then I got married. I thought that would make things easier. Having a partner. Turned out to be a noose that almost choked me to death. So I got a divorce. After that, I became... What's the word everybody loves to use? "Independent." Do you know how many lawyers and judges resent me when I'm successful in the courtroom? When I'm tough? Or better prepared? Or as they say, just plain lucky? Do you know how many times I've heard "little lady" by men who would love to celebrate my losses by taking me out to dinner and then off to bed? And God help you if you make a mistake or falter once. 'Cause then there's a whole chorus out there, whispering, "Honey, you got nice blue eyes, but you just can't quite cut it." Why the hell am I telling you all this? Well, maybe because you're in pain. What happened? I thought Baker was being watched. He slipped surveillance. And there's something else. His alibi for the break-in checked out. How can that be? There's only one way. He had help. Someone else broke into your house, the same someone who covered for him last night. And now there's no sign of him anywhere. Alex, I have a feeling the preliminaries are over. Next time he comes after you, it's gonna be for real. I want you to go into hiding until I can find him. I can't. I can't watch over you 24 hours a day, Alex. You are in danger. Walker, believe me, the way I'm feeling right now, I would love to run and hide, but if I leave now, Benny Carl Devlin is gonna get dumped on another prosecutor and he might go free. He might walk. There's no way I'm gonna take that chance. Am I being too independent? Yes, you are. But I admire you for it. All right. So, what's the plan? Did I mention a plan? Ah. Wonderful. Every muscle-head ex-con in two counties works out here. We're just gonna walk in and ad-lib. One more set, one more set. They should just forget about towels in here and issue deodorant, huh? Gentlemen. Can I sign you up today? Got a special, 2-for-1. Of course, it's supposed to be for husbands and wives, but in your case, I could make an exception. I wanna know about Dewey Baker. Don't know him. You had the cell right next to him in Huntsville. Look, if you've got paper, serve me. Take me down. I still won't talk about Baker. If you ain't got paper, get out of my face. Let me explain something to you, Gilliam. You're still on parole, and half these guys in here are convicted felons. I could bust you right now, put you back on the inside. Look, law says I can't fraternize. So if any of these fine gentlemen have records, I wouldn't know. What if some of these fine gentlemen are dealing drugs on your premises? What does the law say about that? Hey, Mando. That's a lot of weight. Don't wanna get a hernia. Put another plate on. Put 'em both on. Okay. I got it. Get... Get the weight off. Relax. Hey, you can't do that to Armando. Say please. Uh-uh. Don't even think about it. Look, pal, you don't want to do this, all right? Now you owe me. That's 100 for the frames, Forty-two fifty for the lenses. Let go. Let go. That's an amazing stroke of luck. I mean, Mando's here and holding. It's almost as if somebody set up a buy. Well, you know the old saying, Trivette, luck is 98 percent hard work. Your choice, Gilliam. I can take you down with them, or talk to me about Baker. Okay, okay, but listen, if he's anywhere around here you gotta protect me. That man's crazy. Have you seen him since he's been out? No. If I did, I'd hide. When you were on the inside, did he ever say anything about the prosecutor who put him away? Oh, yeah. She was his favorite topic of conversation. Used to hear him talking to Duane all the time about her. Who's Duane? Duane, uh, Hopkins. His cellmate. Sometimes, late at night, Baker'd be lying there after lights out, and he'd be tellin' Duane... what he wanted to do to that woman. How he planned to grab her and take her off to some secluded cabin someplace where nobody'd ever hear her scream. What about this guy Duane? Is he still inside? No. He got out before I did. That little punk. He wouldn't have lasted five minutes without Baker. What was he in for? Burglary. Oh, yeah, he was a peeper too. Used to break into girls' apartments. Probably took pictures. Dewey, they're looking for me. I went into Jack's to get a beer, and they told me the cops had been there. A-a-and they were looking for you too. How'd they get on to you? I don't know. I hadn't said nothing to nobody. It's Walker. Dewey, you told me I'd be safe. You told me they wouldn't find out about me. I've come to a conclusion, Duane. Now, the answer to this problem is really quite simple. We gonna have to kill ourselves a Ranger. And I've chosen you to set him up. Walker. This is Duane Hopkins. I heard you're lookin' for me. Where are you? I'm scared, Walker. Baker's crazy. I think he's gonna kill me. Tell me where you are, Duane. I'll send a police unit to pick you up. No. No cops. Uh, Baker, he's got friends on the force. I'm only talkin' to you, Walker. And I want immunity. Uh, that's my deal. Okay. Where and when? All right, all right. I'll be in my office. I got it, counselor. Baker, freeze! Ooh! Ooh! Ahh! Move it! Or I'll kill 'em both. Ahh! Back! Where'd he go? I don't know. I think he's out there. Everybody stay down! Get out of the way! Let her go, Baker! Let her go! Out! Now! Have the choppers concentrate on all the roads leading out of town. Out. Find anything? Well, I can tell you what kind of gum he chews, what type of junk food he eats, and I got these gas receipts. That's it right now. Give me some shots over here. All right, I'm on it. Charlie! Get some more units over here. I wanna keep these people clear. Please, move along. Thank you. You got something? Cedar leaves. What's the location on those gas receipts? All local. Wait a minute. He filled up in Miller's Flats two days ago. Miller's Flats? Aren't there cedar trees out there? There's a bunch of 'em. That was my district when I was a rookie. How about cabins? As I recall, there's a couple of cabins out there. Yeah. Why? Come on. Gilliam said Baker's gonna take her to a place where no one can hear her scream. I wanna be fair about this, sweetheart. I'm gonna give you a nice, long head start. Yoo-hoo! Where's the little girl? Where you at? Dewey's gonna find you. You're a nice pretty little girl. Don't run away! You lost one shoe. I took the other one off. Didn't look right to have just one. You know I'm goin' to hurt you, don't you? Don't you? Hm? Yes. Well, I just wanted to make sure you knew the reason why. The real reason. You see, it ain't got nothing to do with the fact that you put me in prison. No, ma'am. That's the least of it. What's got me so angry is I've been just sittin' here thinki" about all the good folks down in Cuervo County that's suffered because of you: Men, women, kids too. Friends of mine, Folks that I protected while I was sheriff down there. Sheriff for eight years. While I was away in Huntsville serving that bogus charge you trumped up, everything just kind of went to hell. 'Cause you know why? They replaced me with some namby-pamby bleeding-heart liberal, who ain't got the guts to arrest a jaywalker. Who doesn't beat prisoners or terrorize everyone who tries to complain about it. I did what I had to do. I utilized whatever means available to me to discourage the presence of murderers, thieves and rapists in Cuervo County. Now, since I left there, the crime rate's gone up 30 percent. That's a fantasy, and you know it. There isn't a county in Texas that has had half that amount. You know, I've always considered myself a problem-solver. But for the life of me, I can't figure out how to get your clothes off when you're all tied up like that. I think I'll start at the top and work my way down. Ah! Ow! Drop it! Drop it now! I'll cut her! Now kick it away and move over there with him. Do it! Or I'll cut her! Now! That's a good boy. Baker, stop. Think about it. This is your opportunity to get at that Buffalo Ranger you were talking about, huh? Remember? Come on, let her go. Hold it! That's far enough! Ah! Ahh! Walker, I got it. Thank you. I'm not done yet. You okay? Walker, we're gonna be late for the victory party. There are many ways to celebrate. For the tenth time, what are we doing here? For the tenth time, stop asking so many questions. Okay, fine. You explain this to C.D. He's expecting us to come straight from the courthouse to his place for free beer and ribs. C.D.'s ribs will wait. Come on. Come on, Walker. I got Devlin convicted, didn't I? Murder, first degree. So don't you think I deserve to go to my own victory party? It'll only take a minute. Come on. I haven't been here since Amber died. Oh, shh. What? You'll see. What? You'll see. I bought this little critter for the ranch. But she's just too dadgum independent. So I'd really appreciate it if you'd take her off my hands. Oh, she's beautiful. Oh, yes, you are, aren't you? You're just beautiful, you sweet baby. Cordell... Cordell, sometimes you just amaze me. Well, Alexandra, the truth is you're pretty amazing yourself. Love your pink bow.
