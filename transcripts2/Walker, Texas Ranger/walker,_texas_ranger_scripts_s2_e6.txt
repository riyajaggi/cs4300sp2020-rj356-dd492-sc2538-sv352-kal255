You're supposed to be checking the wheel bearings. I've warned you for the last time, Flanders. Yeah, and I've warned you for the last time, I don't like you raggin' on me in front of the guys! How they gonna respect me, you always yankin' my chain with them lookin'? Respect you? Why should they respect you? 'Cause I'm gonna have your job, butthead. My job? Yeah! Yeah, I'm gonna be foreman. I'm gonna place a few calls, say a few things, and bada-boom, bada-bing. It's gonna be Mickey Flanders, foreman extraordinary! Well, I'll hold my breath. And you go on and place your calls. And you tell whoever you're callin' that one more screwup and you're fired! Hey, Tony, your wife called. Eat dirt. Look, he's gonna get his. They're all gonna get theirs! Sure, Mickey, sure. Only do me a favor and don't get yourself fired. You're the only fun around this hole. What'd I do without you? I ain't gonna get fired. 'Cause I quit! Mickey, what are you, crazy? And you quit too, Leo. I can't quit. Hell, I got habits. I-I smoke, I drink. Hell, I even eat. Well, you stick with me, Leo, and I'll show ya a few things. Like how to get anything you want... anytime... anywhere. Let's go. Thanks for the lift, Ranger Walker. And the flowers for my mom's grave. I owe you. No. Friends don't owe, Archie. Are we really friends? We sure are. If you ever need me... just call. Well... I don't suppose you would, like... be patrolling by here later today? Like this afternoon sometime? What time do you get out of school? Three. I just might be. How old were you when your parents died? Well, just about your age, actually. Both my parents died on the same night, just like yours did. But you had your grandparents to raise you, and... I had my uncle Ray to raise me. Were you telling me the truth about kids making fun of you and your name? Yeah, I sure was. Well, I don't care. Cordell ain't as bad as Archibald. I'll see you later, Archie. Mickey, I don't mind a little down-and-dirty, but do you think we could wait till tonight, choose some place a little less crowded? No, I want crowded. I, uh... I like an audience when I work. You are crazy. Oh, yeah. I am. And invincible. So you just, uh, stick with me, Leo. Come on. Let's make some noise. Man, my stomach is growling. Mind if we pull over someplace and grab a bite to eat? Oh, hey, they got that... The new place in Plano. Serves macrobiotic fresh seaweed, huh? Earth to Walker. Hey, come in, big buddy. Oh, sorry. I was thinking. About what? Parents. What about parents? How hard it is to grow up without 'em. DISPATCHER: Come in, all units in the vicinity of Maple and Overton. Silent alarm at 87765 Maple. Yeah, this is Trivette. We're about four blocks away. Thank you very much. Just like Sunday. Just like church. Pass the collection plate. Come on, everybody. Come on, gramps, put it down. Put it down. The watch? Come on, come on! Hurry up! Okay, here! Don't shoot me, now. Everything. Thank you very much. I can't get over this stash. Come on, let's make our getaway. You know, I, uh... I wanna watch a show. Man, don't strip a gear on me here. Now, let's get! These girls work very hard, Leo. We don't want to see 'em have a bad day just when we're havin' such a good one! Shake it for me. Mick! What are you doin'? Come on, dance for me. Come on, show me your stuff. Come on! Come on, dance for me! Hey, leave her alone! Ted, no. Okay. I'm okay. 'Course she's okay. I just asked her to dance. Did I not ask her nicely enough? Mick, let's boogie! Well, that's what I want her to do. I want her to boogie with me. Come on, baby doll, dance with me. Dance with me. Show Mick your stuff. What are you doin', Tarzan? The cops are on the way, okay? I just hit the silent alarm. They should be here any second. Ya hear that, Mick? The cops, huh? What are they gonna do? You think they gonna help? The cops ain't gonna do diddlyjack! See, you're lookin' at the invincible man! I'm the damned invincible man! Well, I'm a two-time loser. I go down for this, I go down for the duration. You read me, Mick? Nobody's goin' down for nothin'. Mick! Can we just get? All right, but we're taki" Bambi here with us. Ted! Teddy! You see what you get when you mess with me? I'm outta here! Texas Rangers! Drop the guns! Now! Ooh, yes, sir. Yes, sir, Rangers. Go ahead, Leo, drop the gun. They asked us awful nicely. Drop the gun. Everyone okay? Yeah. Anyone else hurt? All right, get on the floor. Face down. Spread your arms and legs. Come on, move. Call an ambulance! There's a lot of blood. Walker, toss me your cuffs. You guys all right? Why are you so happy, pal? Well, we just had us some laughs. Wait till the boys hear us tell about it at Scully's tonight, huh, Leo? I don't know. I think you'll be eatin' chipped beef tonight. Nah. We'll be downin' some brewskies at Scully's tonight. You wait and see, Leo. I told ya, I'm invincible. Teddy. Please be okay. Please, please be okay. Flanders. Mickey Flanders. Uh, 3375 Verdugo Road. Hey, when do I get my phone call? You get your phone call when I say. Ooh! You see what you got here, Leo, is a man frustrated by his job. You know, you should just take it from me and Leo and just chuck it all and go out and blow off some steam. The only thing I'm gonna blow off is that smart-ass attitude you're sportin'. Hey, why don't you just finish up so I can make my phone call and get outta here? You're not going anywhere. Not till the judge finds out whether that boy'll live or die. Hey, can you imagine stickin' your beak in a loaded gun for some bimbo stripper? Heh. If he lives, he's got a good life lesson on him. Let me tell you something... punk. That was his sister. And you're the one in for a life lesson. Hey, what's your name and your badge number? You got a bad attitude. Walker. And take a good look at it. You want a better look? I didn't say anything. Ranger Walker, Trivette? Miss Cahill would like to see you right away. Tell her we're bookin' some prisoners now. She said ASAP. Hey, Randy. Yeah? Wanna finish givin' these guys their stats? Hey, so long, Walker. It was nice meetin' ya. I'll remember you. What do you mean, you're gonna let 'em go? Walker, I know how upset you are. Two guys waltz into this place, rob and terrorize everyone in there, and then they shoot a kid who may or may not live, and now you're gonna let 'em go? What makes you think I'm upset? Look, I'm not happy about this either. But I've got pressure coming down on me from upstairs. All right? Pressure from upstairs? From who? I can't go into that. You can't go... What?! Look, all I can tell you is that Mickey Flanders and Leo Cale are not gonna be arraigned. They are not gonna be held, they're not gonna be booked. I can't tell you anything more, but... forget this case. It's not active. It's not even a case. Look... I hate this. I wanna tell you more. Not that it would make you feel better. But I hate issuing commands like this and leaving so many unanswered questions. There's only one unanswered question, Alex. When are these hot rodders gonna go out and do it again? Maybe that won't happen. Trust me, it will happen. We're just gonna let 'em walk outta here and do it. No, we aren't. Forget it, Walker. Is that clear? This is an official order. Do not pursue this matter for another second. You got it? I got it. But I'm not gonna take it. I mean it, Trivette. He is gonna get into such deep trouble that nobody's gonna be able to bail him out. Randy, I left you in charge of those two prisoners. Where in the hell are they? They came and took 'em away. Who? A couple of double-breasted suits. They had authorization from the DA's office. Sorry. I th... Walker. You're not gonna believe this, man. They're gone. Gone? What do you mean, gone? There's nothin' there. It's gone. I thought once you put something into a computer, it was permanent. Yeah, you can get charges dropped, files misplaced, felonies can be squashed, and to get yanked from the main computer takes an act of God. Yeah, it's like we never even arrested 'em in the first place. They say he's stable. I guess that's, uh... That's what they call it if you're not gonna die any second. Well, he's got a strong will to live, and that's a good sign. Yeah. It counts for a lot. Well, what'll really count for me is seeing the men who did this get exactly what they deserve. I can't tell you how important it's been for me just to hang on to that. Just knowing that they were caught and that they won't go free. Thank you, Ranger Walker... Ranger Trivette. Thank you both so much for getting them. Well, Vickie, there's something I've got to explain to you. What is it? Well, the two men we arrested... they've been released. Released? What do you mean, released? You mean on bail? After what they did? No, not on bail. The charges were dropped. Dropped? And... There were all those witnesses! I mean, you were there. You saw! God! Well, I'm gonna go find a rock to crawl under. Let's go find the rock Mickey Flanders crawled under. I wish to heck I could remember the exact address he gave. W... Wait a minute. Okay. Um, he said somethin' about... goin' to Scully's to talk to the boys tonight. Scully's. I've heard of that place. It's a dance hall over on Lockridge. Sounds about their speed. You and I are gonna drop by there tonight. Now, wait... Wait a minute. I'm supposed to remind you what Alex said about us not buttin' in. Yeah, well, you reminded me. I'll pick you up at 7. Good. Where you goin'? I have to pick up a friend. Where'd he go? Go this way. Come on! Don't let him get away! Get outta the way! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there, partner. Ranger Walker. What are you doing here? I told you I may stop by. I hope you didn't go out of your way or nothin'. Nah. How 'bout a lift? Well, unless you'd rather walk. I'll take the lift. Okay, come on. Come on, guys. Here we go, little buddy... C.D.'s special super-duper triple-scooper. Guaranteed to give you a bellyache for a week. Wow! Thanks, C.D. How much do I owe ya? Oh, it's on the house. I mean, uh, just don't tell your grandparents who made you sick. You know, Archie, eventually you're gonna have to face up to those bullies. There you go. You ruined his appetite. I can't. Why not? 'Cause. I'm afraid of them. You know, it's a funny thing about bullies. They only pick on kids who are afraid of them. If you'd face this guy and look him right in the eye and say, "if you want a piece of me, come and get it," nine times out of ten, they're gonna back down. But what about the other time? Well... well, then you're gonna have to give it your best shot, Archie. But believe me, win or lose, they're gonna know you're not gonna take it anymore, so they're gonna find some other scared kid to pick on. But they're bigger than me. You gotta be bigger than them up here. If you want to be a good hitter, son, you gotta get up to bat. All the guys that knocked the home runs... they've struck out the most too. But they weren't afraid of gettin' hit with the ball. Right, Cordell? That's right. It's just like Archimedes said: "Give me a lever big enough, I'll move the world." Who? Archimedes. A scientist. He lived about, um... about, uh, 250 B.C. You know, back when they had them big puffed pants? Uh... he's from out of town. His name is weirder than mine! C.D., will you take Archie home when he gets done? Yep. But we're gonna sit here and eat all that ice cream. We're not gonna let that homemade ice cream spoil, are we? Ranger Walker, thanks. You're welcome, Archie. Where's he going? To get a great big lever. He's gonna move the world. Let me have this cherry here, will ya? ♪ Take my license away ♪ ♪ And that'll be the day ♪ ♪ Yeah, that'll be the day ♪ He just got us sprung. We capped this guy in front of ten, 20, maybe 30 witnesses, and here I am, back on the street. They didn't even finish bookin' us. No way. Matter of fact, maybe we oughta take a joyride, take somethin' down. Then... you'll see. Evening, Leo. Your buddy's not here to protect you tonight, Leo. Well, I don't know what you want with me. I'm just havin' a couple brews with my buds here. I didn't do nothing wrong. Where is your buddy, Mickey Flanders? What's the matter? Ain't he on your computer? No, he's not. But we found you. Two-time loser, waitin' to go down one more time. Three strikes, you're out. Well, then, I guess, Mr. Trivette, it would be in my best interest, uh, to cooperate... with my friend Mickey... because he's invincible. And I stick with him, then I'm invincible too! As a matter of fact, I think it would be a good idea if the two of you got out of this bar before I broke this bottle over your face! Why, you...! Oh, hey, wait. Yeah? Can you get me an orange juice, please? Sure. Clean glass. Always. C'mon, buddy. Very nice. ♪ ...take my license away ♪ ♪ That'll be the day ♪ ♪ That'll be the day ♪ ♪ That'll be the day ♪ You'd better settle down, Leo, before you get me mad. Where's Mickey Flanders? You won't get away with this. I already have. The next words outta your mouth had better be his address. Hey, this is a great dinner, sis. Thank you. But I'm sorry, I gotta hit the bricks. No, Mickey, no. You can't go. I made all your favorite foods. You can't go out tonight. Well, I-I... What am I gonna do? Eat dinner? Sit around, watch the boob tube and get brain rot? Not that you got it, sis, but you know, you should get out. You're young. Live it up. Oh, and who shall I live it up with? Leo and those other deadbeats you hang around with at the pool hall? It's a dance hall and Leo is a very cool dude. You know, you should've gone out with him that time. Ew. Come here. Mwah! You be good. Don't be late. All right. Hello, Mickey. Now, how the hell did you get here? Leo sends his regards. Mickey? Is everything all right? Yeah, everything's just hunky-dory. Well, then... what's the problem? Absolutely nothin', sis, right? You two guys aren't on any active case, are you? Miss Flanders? Yeah. Lainie Flanders. Did you know your brother committed armed robbery, and in the process, shot a man? What? Uh... no. Don't listen to these two gomers. I'm gonna sue you right down to your belt buckle. You can't go around saying these things! There weren't any charges! No official charges, but it happened just the same. And there's a man in the hospital on life support to prove it. No. No, I don't believe it. And... I don't believe you. And I don't know what kind of sick joke this is, but I want both of you to get off of my porch. We wouldn't joke about something this serious, ma'am. You heard my sister. Get out! Now! Come on, Lainie... No. Mickey... Now, you tell me what happened! You wanna know what happened? You wanna know? These guys, they're crazy. We didn't do nothin'. Come on. It's me. It's Mickey. Gktt! Gktt! Don't! When we were kids. Come on! It's Mick. Come here. Come here. You're crazy. You know that? You're crazy. Mmmwah! I love you. Nothin' happened. Nothin'. It better not have happened. You can sure tell his sister has no idea what kind of creepazoid Flanders is, can't ya? Yeah. Okay. Where do we go from here? Look... All right, when I went back to the courthouse today, I ran Mickey Flanders through every database of every computer in the country I could access. And? Nothin' but a mechanic. Member of local 355. He's got no priors, no DUI, not even a parking ticket. So explain to me how a guy like that suddenly goes on a rampage, man. Well, maybe the Mickey Flanders we know of doesn't exist. Why do you keep lookin' in that rear view mirror? Hands on the wheel! Just take it easy. You better have a good reason for tailing us. Watch it. I'm just gonna get the wallet. You Rangers were told not to stick your badges where they don't belong! Seems I'm gonna have to rip 'em off! Good morning. Stay, Amigo. Good morning. Here... For you. And what is this for? A doughnut and coffee, and there's not even a favor attached. Mm-hm. That'll be a first. So, what are you doing up so early? Up early? I haven't been to bed yet. I have been on the phone with everyone from the attorney general to the governor to the director of the FBI. You kicked over a heck of a hornet's nest. All in a day's work. That's not funny. I almost lost my job trying to help you keep yours. Some job you got, Alex, protectin' a slimeball like Mickey Flanders. Agent Escalante explained it to you. They are not protecting Mickey Flanders, they're protecting his sister, Lainie. She's the one whose testimony can put away the head of the Bayone crime syndicate. But when she agreed to join the Witness Protection Program, she made a not-altogether unreasonable request that her only living relative, her brother, be brought along too. So because this gal's on the Witness Protection Program, her brother has an open ticket, right? Obviously, they don't intend for the people in the program to commit crimes, but it does happen. And apparently this case is so big back in New Jersey, and it's gonna put away so many mobsters, that they feel they can't jeopardize it. So Vickie Hurley sits in a hospital waiting to see if her brother will live or die, and that's fair, right? No. Come on, Walker. You know what this guy told me, this Agent Escalante? What? He said they haven't even told her what her brother has done. They're afraid it may spook her, and in turn she may think that they'll cut her brother loose from the program. She doesn't even know, Alex. Apparently, that's one of the reasons they're so upset with you, is that you tried to tell her. Oh, bull. Look, Walker... You're right. There's nothing I can say. I hate it too. But you know what? I guess I am asking you for a favor. I'm asking you to sit this one out so we can continue our work together after it's all over. A favor, Amigo. What do you think? Hm? You can have your doughnut back. Where are you going? To get ready. Ready for what? School. Ugh! Boo! So, Archibald, are you gonna run, or are you waiting for the Lone Ranger to ride up in the nick of time? I don't need anyone to help me with you. You're cruisin' for a bruisin', ain't you, squirt? Ugh! You're askin' for it, ain't ya? Come on! Let's see how tough you are without your friends helping. You want a piece of me? Come and get it. You're serious? He's serious, Rick. He's gonna fight you. Well, I don't wanna waste my time with you, squirt. Come on, guys. You guys comin', or what? How long you been here? Heh-heh. Long enough. I guess they won't be botherin' you anymore. Well, at least not them. Thanks for coming by. I might've needed your help. Heh. I don't think so. I think you had everything under control. But I was afraid. I didn't know what was gonna happen. I was really afraid. Well, being afraid's okay. In fact, getting knocked down every once in a while's not the worst thing in the world. You know, if you ever meet a man who doesn't have a scar or two, that means he never fought for anything he believed in. Hey, that's what C.D. told me last night when he was driving me home. Heh. Well... he's the one that taught me. And how did you do? Did you find that lever you need? Lever? You know, to move the world. All you need is the right lever. Heh-heh. Yeah, I found it. Now all I gotta do is use it. Uh, Miss Flanders? Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. I just need to... Look! I don't have to speak to you. I have nothing to say to you. I know you don't have to, I have something to say... Look, I don't believe any of the things you said about my brother, so just leave us alone! I don't care if you believe anything or not. I want to show you something. Oh, really? What do you want to show me? Huh? Look, I don't have to see anything. I believe what my brother told me. If you believe that, then you won't be afraid to come with me. All right? All right. Oh, hi, Vickie. Hi, Ranger Walker. Oh, Vickie Hurley, this is, uh, Lainie Flanders. Hi. Hi. I'm really sorry about your brother. Thanks. But he's gonna be okay, you know? He just has to be. I just keep praying, and I know that he will. He has to. Have you heard anything at all on those men? Not yet. Um, Ranger Walker told me about what happened. It's really awful. He said that you would be able to identify the man who did this. I could pick him out of a room of 50 with the lights off. He was this close to me. He would've kidnapped me and probably worse if my brother hadn't... He's gonna be okay, you know. He has to. 'Cause it'd be bad enough losing him. But if I lose him, and the men who did this to him go free, it would just be too much. Then this whole damn world would just go topsy-turvy. And I don't think that it would ever make much sense. Excuse me. I really need to go sit with Ted. It was nice meeting you, Lainie. Lainie, I'm sorry I had to do that to you. You realize what you're asking me to do? To give up my brother. I don't want to lose him, any more than Vickie wants to lose hers. I can understand that, but protecting your brother from prosecution is only encouraging him to commit more crimes. That's not what I'm doing. You are wrong about that. I'm not wrong, Lainie, and you know it. I know you understand the difference between right and wrong. Otherwise, you wouldn't have uprooted your life the way you did. You know, it made it so much easier for me knowing... that wherever they finally put me... my little brother was gonna be with me. Now I don't know what I'm gonna do. Wait a minute, Lainie. What? Where are your agents? Aren't they supposed to have 24-hour surveillance on your house? They're always supposed to be out in the car. Well, there's no one in the car. Could they be in the house? No, they never go in the house. Why don't you get back in the truck. Are you okay? Yeah. They found me. Yeah, two guys from the East Coast. Probably sent here to keep you from testifying. How did they find me? Well, you brother and Leo have been bragging around town a lot about what they've been doing. Word like that spreads real fast. Oh, my God. This is my horse, Amigo, Archie. Which horse do you like? You mean I can pick whichever one I want? You bet. Horses are like people, Archie. Some of 'em you like, some of 'em you don't. You don't wanna ride 10 miles of fence line with one you don't like. You mean, like my Aunt Louise? She's always hanging over me with this really bad perfume, and kissing me and... Yuck! Yeah, like your Aunt Louise. Do you want to see some tricks? Yeah. Is your leg hurt? Well, let's do something about that. That feel better? That... Yeah, okay. All right, if you feel better, take it off. Yeah. Thank you, Amigo. You want to show Archie how to twirl a rope? Okay. How about having Amigo twirl it for me? How's that? Yeah. All right. Come here, Amigo. Okay. All right. Ah, good horse. Yeah. There you go. How 'bout that, huh? Would you hold this for me? Hi. Walker, thanks for saving Lainie, for takin' care of those two punks that killed my man on the stakeout. Well... I, uh... We're... leaving in a couple of hours. I wanted you to know how badly I feel about the man that my brother shot. But, um, my brother is the only person that I have left in this world. And without him, I'd be completely alone. I know that my brother is no saint. But without him... there would be nobody left who knows who I really am... or cares. I've given up so much already. I can't give him up. Please say that you understand. Please. I understand. I wish that there was something that I could do for you. You know? I mean, you've done so much for me. You saved my life. I wish I could help you more, Lainie. Just find happiness, okay? Okay. Well, did you pick your horse yet? Yep. I want that one. A good choice, Archie. He's a good horse. Did you brush your teeth? Yep. Okay. Well, say your prayers and hop in bed. There'll be a lot of fence to ride tomorrow. Okay. Uh, you mind? This is kinda between me and God. Okay. Good night. Good night. God bless Mom and Dad, and God bless Grandma and Grandpa and my Aunt Louise. But you could tell her to lay off a little. And God bless my new horse, Trigger. And double God bless Ranger Cordell Walker. His buddy, Leo, they were both together. - They gave us the slip. - I can't believe it. Come on, you gotta explain it. Now, let me do the talkin'. Come here. What's the problem here? Well, we got a big problem. What happened? I don't know how to tell you. Um... Mickey Flanders disappeared. We can't find him. What? I'm sorry. I don't... What? Your brother flew the coop, and we have a damn plane to catch. Now! Then I'm not going. You have to. I want you out of town by daylight. No. Now, the deal was that you were supposed to be protecting Mickey too. That was our deal and I am not leaving without him! Come on. No! He ain't worth it. Listen to me, Lainie. Forget about him. I'm telling you, we can't wait any longer. Your life is in danger. Damn you! Didn't you hear me? Mickey! Okay, you got five minutes to calm down, get yourself together. And then we break it down! Wait! She went out the back! Damn. Come on, let's go. Let's roll! Mickey. Yeah? I got a creepy feelin'... Oh, would you just shut your hole and stop your bellyachin'? We're in this together, and I... I'm invincible. Just remember that. Shh. Sweet dreams, Walker. Come on, let's go! Go! Surprise, Walker. Drop the gun. Drop it! Don't you move a muscle. Let the boy go, Flanders. Who's gonna make me? Mickey! Mickey, don't you dare do this! Please don't do this. Wait. What are you tryin' to pull? Don't do this. You think you're so smart, Walker, trying to turn my sister against me. Well, it's not gonna happen. We're family! I'm her brother! I don't even know who you are anymore! Lainie, it's me, Mickey. Same as always. No, it's not the same as always. Mickey, please don't do this to us. You don't know what you're doing, okay? Don't do this. Now, you give me the gun. Come on. Give me the gun. Give me the gun! Call an ambulance. Get the cuffs on him. - Right. Archie, get in the house, son. Come on, let's go, son. Come on. He's all right inside. Lainie. It's not his fault. Okay, okay. Please... All right. Oh, I... I'm hurt. Shh! Hold on. Hold on, Lainie. Hold on. Who's gonna protect you now? Let's go. Get him in the car. We got him. Hello. Hi, Ranger Walker. It's Vickie. Oh, hi, Vickie. How's Ted doing? Well, that's why I'm calling. It's to let you know that he's doin' great. Oh, that's great to hear. Well, I just wanted to let you know. Okay, thanks for callin' me. See you later. Bye. Good.
