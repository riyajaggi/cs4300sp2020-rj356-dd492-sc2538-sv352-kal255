 It's that crazy Ranger. I told you what he done up at the Wrecking Bar last Saturday? You sure that's him? Yeah. I'm looking for Snake Larkin. Well, well, Curly. Long time, no see. Nobody gave you an invite, Walker. My badge is my invite, Curly. Does anyone here know Snake Larkin?

 He used to run with Blackjack. Come on. Everybody in here used to run with Blackjack. We don't give up our own. I believe in family values, too, Curly, but... your idea of family sucks the high wind. Nice seeing you, Curly. Where's Snake? Who's Snake? Never mind. For the last time. Where's Snake Larkin? Over here, Ranger. I'm Snake Larkin.

 - I - can't believe I did it. Somebody tell me why I was so stupid as to volunteer for this gig. Because you're a dedicated man, Trivette, and that's what it takes. No, no. Because I'm low man on the totem pole. Because I'm expendable, and 'cause you're not. Well, don't anybody just jump in and argue with me here. Look. You both know I wasn't in favor of this. But you guys did a great job setting Trivette's cover. Blackjack's crew will get word to him about the bust, You'll go in with solid credentials, and that should make it easier to get next to him. Then we can find out if this drug ring is operating inside the prison. So when I'm done with this job, do I get paroled or what? Walker. Mm. Warden Sikes is in on this. If you have any trouble whatsoever, you just get to him. Is this just me, or is this beginning to sound like one of those movies where the brave reporter goes undercover in a prison, and the only person who knows about it happens to die of a heart attack, and then the brave reporter ends up spending his life doing life? Now you know the reason I didn't volunteer. You're really building my confidence. You better get down to holding. You're on the next bus to Huntsville, and it leaves within the hour. See, now, even a real convict has a chance to put his affairs in order. Well, if the affair you're talking about is Lainie the dispatcher, she'll be here when you get out. You see? He's loving this. Let's go. You guys can kid all you want. But what you're planning to do is extremely dangerous. If they even suspect that you're a plant, they won't hesitate to kill you. Ooh. Hi, Cordell. I just wanted to check and see if your luck had changed yet. My luck had changed? Yeah. Dang it, C.D., I told you not to send me another chain letter. That's not an ordinary chain letter. That was written by a Peruvian monk in 1947. That very letter has been around the world nine times. Let it go around the world ten times without me. I know how you feel, Cordell. I was the same way. One time I passed four days. You know what happened to me? My business went to hell in a hand basket. Termites ate down my smokehouse. The IRS notified me that I was under audit. This is very, very strong medicine. Hey, Walker. You need a lucky rabbit's foot, like me, man. Yeah, lucky for you, not for the rabbit. Look, Cordell, I'm begging you, the last guy that broke this chain had a hell of a lot of bad luck. Lightning struck a tree. The tree fell on his home. His wife was eating, and she swallowed an entire runaki. "Runaki"? Yeah, a piece of wood with meat on its end. "Rumaki," C.D. They spent $15,000 getting it out of her throat. Sounds critical, Walker. Better listen to him. Then let him send you one. All right. Let's just put it this way. The good Lord put up the goal post. We can play this game any way we wanna play it. If you don't forward that letter, go ahead and tear it up. Just tear it up. Oh, my God, no. You're out of your mind. You must be out of your head. Do you realize what you've done? That's a very dangerous thing to be doing. Dire circumstances can arise out of something like that. Say goodbye. Jimmy, stay away from him for ten days. He's poison. Hey, Lainie. Hi, Trivette. I tried to call you last night for dinner. I was at my mom's. I got your message really late. What's up with the new look? I'm going... He's going away for a while. Away? Yeah. Say goodbye. Goodbye. I'll call you later! This footage, shot earlier in the day near Shreveport, shows rescue efforts in... We have this word just in from the coast guard. Hurricane Patty is expected to hit Galveston tonight. All coastal area residents are being advised to begin evacuating their homes. I don't want to go out in that. Man, why do we gotta go out in that? Hey, if you guys stop jerking around, we'll beat this storm. Man, this ain't no storm. This is some killing waiting to happen. That suits me fine. Quicker I die, the quicker I'm out of here. Yeah, well, after what you did to that family in Addison, you dying quick would suit a lot of people just fine. It was borin'. I was just killin' time. Walker. What you got? Happy camper for you. Going to Huntsville. Hey, you're just in time for the bus. What did this guy do? Killed three cops, two of 'em friends of mine. This one's personal. Put your junk on the counter. Now. Your mother ever teach you to say please, man? You know, it's gonna be a lot harder to say goodbye to you than I thought. Excuse us. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, come on, man. Just hit him. I'm gonna break your face! Stay back. I'm enjoying this. Hit him with it! Okay, Snake. Right here. Swing it right here. Come on. You broke my nose! Dang, I didn't think I hit you that hard. Nyah-nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah. You pothead. He's ours now. Yeah, for life. Let's go. Move it. It stinks on this bus, man. Hey, is there a problem back there? - Anybody say there's a problem? - Come on, let's ride. What's the hold up? No, there's no problem. All right, you guys, sit down. Move it. Beat the storm. Keep her steady, Kyle, we're almost there. There's thunder and lightning. Man, I'm so scared. Yo, shut up, man. Leave me alone. Yo, man, somebody shut him up! Hey. The two of you are out of population soon as we get there. It's all right, man. It's all right. We're almost there. If we get there. We'll get there. Only ten more miles. Me and you, man. Me and you, brother. I love a man who can't get enough. Yo, man, I ain't givin' you nothing, fish-man. You a mama's boy. Shut up, man. Scared of a little rain? Man is smart. This storm's like a runaway freight train, tearing across this county, stomping and killing everything in its path. Listen to that wind out there. Sounds like somebody's killing an animal. Probably the sound we'll be making when it catches us. Okay, that's it. Shut up, look straight ahead. Move! Move! Come on! Come on! Woo. Great! Let's go, let's go! How's it feel? Scared now, O'Malley? He'll just slow us down. He's our ticket out for down the line. I've got a family. We love you, too, O'Malley. Come on. Let's go. Risen considerably. Business owners are trying to prepare for the coming storm. Just south of here, wind has been measured up to 60 miles an hour. Despite predictions, hurricane Patty smashed into Galveston early this evening, catching many residents by surprise. Winds have been estimated at 125 miles an hour. C.D., if I wasn't a man of great reason, I'd be tempted to lay this hurricane business at your doorstep. You and that chain letter. Speaking of chain letters, why did you send me another one? That's not another one. This is a replacement of the one you accidentally tore up. C.D., you were a Ranger for 25 years? 28 years, young lady, unless I've lost some years along the way. I should think you'd know the penalty for sending this stuff through the federal postal system. Clause five says, "Send no cash." Faith has no price. It's still emotional extortion. John Doe A inherited a million dollars, while John Doe B broke the chain and then died nine... days later. Well, garden seed. Look at that, Alex. Just look at that. And look at this roof. It's just like a sieve. That's proof. Don't argue with him, Alex. Since he's retired, his brain's gone sideways. Hello. C.D.'s. No, we're closed. What? All right, just a minute. Alex. Alex Cahill. Yes. What? Are you sure? When was the last time you talked to the warden? Try again. Yes, right now. Call me back. What about the warden? Is Trivette okay? The bus... It never got there, Walker. They thought it would be late because of the storm, but it's three hours overdue. Where do you think you're going? Walker. Walker, are you crazy? There's a hurricane out there! Uncle Ray, what can he hope to do? My son never hopes. He just does. When Cordell Walker saddles up to somethin', nobody can stop him. Not even the wrath of God. How you coming? Almost got everything boarded up out there. It's bad. Yeah. It's like a morgue up there. I guess everybody got out okay. Got out? When that trooper arrived, it was like a stampede. I'm not sure it was necessary to evacuate. Well, think of the complaints. As soon as the electricity goes, the elevator won't work. We won't be able to serve meals. Can you imagine the lawsuit if somebody got hit by flying glass? Did you see Robin leave? She probably left with her boyfriend. Mr. Charm. She picked him. I didn't. Get him in here, get him in here. Come on, bust the door. Good evening, folks. We'll take the bridal suite. And everything that goes with it. There you go, new boy. Relax. Give us a big smile. Be stupid if you want to, Rollins, but not me. He's right, man. Shouldn't we post lookouts or somethin'? Hicks, you been institutionalized too long. We're five miles in the middle of nowhere. The only way cops are going to reach us is by tractor or submarine. Minute it lets up, we're out of here. While it keeps blowing, we're safe. Ain't no one's gonna be out looking for us tonight. So, what are your names? Dick Sant. I run this place. And your wife? Cathy. I'd like to hear her say it. I'm Catherine Sant. You know, Catherine, you weren't married, I'd propose to you in a minute. Mm. Don't worry, Mrs. Sant. No one's gonna hurt you. Soon as the storm's over, we'll be gone. But we'll need transportation. In the garage, there's a van and a pickup truck. Here. Fly. Fly. Here. Go check it out. Hey, bud. Ninety percent of all accidents happen in the home. Don't feel bad, old boy. The dumb ones always go first. New boy, front and center. You want me for something, Rollins, you call me by my name: Snake. No offense meant. Seeing as how you and Gomez are gonna be the only two that are completely sober, and you get along so well, maybe you could go help keep an eye on our guest. Yeah, all right. I-I ain't want no fish. What you want is what I tell you. Now, take him inside. Get up. We don't want Mrs. Sant breathing the same air as scum like that. All right, so, what about hooking me up? Gomez has one. Should be enough. Now, Dick, Cathy, either of you care for a drink? Who you calling, fish? Tony's Pizza, man. I'm hungry. That sounds good, O'Malley, doesn't it? You hungry, huh? Maybe you wanna eat this, huh? Look, all you guys have to do is just turn your head for five seconds, and I'm gone, okay? When this is all over, I'll tell them you helped me. Both of you. No kidding. Jeez, what a deal. That sounds good, huh, Snake? You gonna say something? Man, my stomach's talking. There's gotta be some grub in this place, man. What kind of hotel is this? Let me go check it out. No, I'll go. You wait, just like Rollins told you to, man. God, this whole thing's a nightmare. The only reason I took this job is 'cause of the recession. I mean... Shh! Take it easy. Take it easy. I'm one of the good guys. Not letting anything happen. Right, I'm a Texas Ranger. What? All right? Now, you gotta wait for your moment. You know the area very well? Do you know the area? Yes. You gotta get to a telephone. Watch out for Rollins and Gomez. Gomez is wired. Rollins is smart. Shh! Man, this place is huge. I can't find any kitchen. Have to tie a rope to myself. Otherwise I'll never find my way back. You didn't even go check. Let me go get some food. Yo, forget it, man, all right? Forget it, okay? Who are you? Walker, Texas Ranger. Who are you? Robin Henley. What do you think you're doing, Robin? That's a pretty dumb question for a Ranger. All right. Why are you doing it? It's none of your business. Please give me my gun back. Well, it is my business, but right now I don't have time to deal with it. This hotel's been taken over by a group of escaped convicts. They've got the owners hostage. Cathy and Dick? If that's their names. I can't take anymore of this. Just give me my gun back and leave me alone! Look. Right now I need your help. Now, are you willing to help me? What can I do? I'm a cripple. Your mind's not crippled. Okay? Oh, yeah. What are you doin'? Treasure huntin', man. So far I found $70 in petty cash. Seen Fly? No. Uh-uh. Sent him out to the garage over half-hour ago. Let her go! You pig! You pig! Leave her. Rollins said... Rollins said leave her alone! Yeah, that's right. That's right. A man who listens. Next man touches Mrs. Sant's gonna be outside swimming back to Galveston. Understand? Yeah, we understand. You want her all for yourself. Get him! Get him! You told me... That's twice I've seen it now. You move like lightning, bucko. I'll be back as soon as I can. Please let Cathy and Dick be all right. So tell me, mate. What'd you mean back there? What was all that "you said" guff? He said he'd kill me. Why don't we give O'Malley a taste of what it's like. Go stick him in the closet. A small, dark closet. As small and dark as I can find. Hey. Where'd you get that speed of yours, bucko? High school football, bucko. You move at the speed of sound. Gonna have to keep my eye on you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I understand that. Yeah. Just... Just keep trying to get through, will ya? Please. Yeah, much obliged. Still no word? Not from the bus or from Walker. Well, he'll need this fire when he returns. You're so sure he's gonna be okay. Look here, young lady. Washoe's in harmony with the spirits around him. They'll take care of him. What if... What if the prisoners got loose? Washoe's smarter and meaner than any prisoner I ever knew. If you're gonna waste your time worrying, worry about them. You're the ugliest sucker I've ever seen. Ah. You did a great job, Robin. Yeah, for a cripple. Why are you feeling so sorry for yourself? I mean, there's millions of handicapped people out there living very productive lives. I had a productive life. I was the resident golf pro at Cathy and Dick's hotel in Arizona. When the accident happened, my fiancé said he still loved me. We'd work through it together. I never heard from him again when I got out of the hospital. Jeez... Easy. You almost gave me a heart attack. Never relax, Trivette. It'll get you killed. Relax? Do I look relaxed to you? How are the hostages doing? Okay, so far. Well, we got another problem. There's a woman upstairs who's trying to commit suicide. You got to be kidding me. Yeah, she's in a wheelchair. Drunk driver hit her six months ago, and she can't move her legs. So, what are we gonna do about her? Well, I've got her calmed down for now. That's all we need is for those convicts to hear something and start searching this place. Especially since one of them's missing already. I don't suppose you know anything about that? About what? Hey! That's my butt down there, man. If you just keep pulling those guys out. When you just picking guys off... Okay. Where you headed? Rawlins or Rollins sent me to check on that guy. Rawlins, Rollins? How do you spell it? R-O... Only kidding. Let me tell you something. That's the head honcho, and he needs his tires rotated. Then tell him that his buddy took off in the hotel van. Okay. When I see Rollins, I'm gonna rotate his tires for him... and clean his carburetor, to boot. I believe you. Write if you get work. Hold it! Turn around. A Ranger. Rollins is gonna want to talk to you. Let's go. You okay? I'm fine. I can get up myself. I know you can. Then I wouldn't have got a chance to put my arms around you. You two okay? You know, Dick, it occurs to me there must be a safe somewhere in this hotel with a considerable amount of cash in it. Am I right? It's just some petty cash. Would you be so kind as to go with those two gentlemen and get however much there is? Gomez, Hicks! Oh, don't worry, Dick. She'll be fine. You got my word on it. Spangler, go call your mother. My mother's dead. Well, go call her anyway. Look, Mrs. Sant. Cathy. I know you're upset. "We have no choice in the matter" is about how I can say it, Cathy girl. We're just human beings, just like you and your husband. Just men. Why don't you let us go. Oh, Catherine. Pretty Catherine. Don't be afraid of me. Nothing happens if we don't want it to. Hey, Rollins. Can't find Fly, man. And your van's gone. Yo, Rollins! Rollins! Yo, Rollins. Man, we hit pay dirt. Five grand. Seems to me you underestimated the amount of cash in your safe, Dick. Good thing it wasn't intentional. Now, go sit with your wife. I can't take too much more of this storm, man. The sound's driving me nuts. Yo, man. You keep it up, knucklehead, I'm gonna slash you up. Why don't you chill, man. Yo, who you talkin' to, Snake? I'm just sayin' it's no time to lose your cool. And you don't need to mess with him. We're gonna be outta here soon. Oh, we gonna be outta here? Yo, man, two days ago you wasn't even alive to me. Now, I don't know who you are or why we brought you along... Stop pointing that knife at pe... What you gonna do, man? What you gonna do? Right. Hold it, everyone. Shut up! Go check it out. Come on, man. It's probably just the storm. Well, then it's just the storm. So go check it out. Yo, come on, you big knucklehead. Let's go. Let's move! Move, knucklehead! Let's go! Let's go! Go. Let's move. Move! You hungry? Hey! There's some chick in a wheelchair here. What are you talkin' about? Here in the hotel? Yeah. She just... She just smiled at me. Come on. Come on. Come on! You go that way. Hurry up. Go that way. All right! I'm not crazy. And just who are you? The last person you'll see before lights out. Yes. What's going on? I-I don't know. It's Spangler. Span... He's wigging out. What? About what? Where's Tripp? What, he's gone too? He said there's somebody else in the hotel. I knew it. That's what happened to Fly. Man, there ain't nobody else in this hotel. Yeah, yeah. H-he said there's some... chick in a wheelchair? Come on. Yeah, yeah. Man, that's what Spangler said, man. There's some... Some... Some invalid broad? Some invalid broad took out Fly and Spangler and Tripp. Man, get real. HICKS: You'd be surprised. Some people with wheelchairs, man, they black belts. They play basketball. I seen on Special Olympics. Shut up, you idiot! There's someone else in this hotel besides us, mates. So we're gonna search this place floor by floor... and kill anything that moves. Okay. Tie the wire to that nail over there. I can't reach it. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Hey, there he is. Oh, jeez, I can't look. You can't what? Man, he... Thank you, God. Hey, you should never relax, partner. It'll get you killed. Not a chance. Oh. Come meet a friend. Robin Henley, Major Trivette. Charmed. They're searching this place floor by floor. I came up the back stairs. A couple of other people took the elevator to three and four. What the hell? Hey, Snake! Snake, what the hell happened to him? Man, I don't know. We split up. I'm looking down here. He's supposed to be looking down... Oh, and you didn't see anything, and you didn't hear anything? No, man. I just talked to him a minute ago. Whoever got him must've went down the steps or down the elevator. Yeah, right. Unless you did it yourself. Oh, yeah, right, Gomez. Even if I did, man, at least you don't have to listen to him crying about the storm anymore. Get out of here. Hey, take him downstairs. I'm gonna go check up here. All right. Wow. Hey, that was pretty slick, Trivette. Don't encourage him. Flattery goes to his head. Okay, now what? Well, I think it's time to go for the kill shot. Take Rollins out. Now, he's down there with the Sants. I don't know if we can get him before he gets them. When I was downstairs, I noticed the main breaker for the hotel's electrical system. You get back to Rollins, and at exactly 3:10, I'll pull the main. You grab Dick and Cathy and get the heck outta there. I'll count to ten and throw it back on. Is there anything I can do to help? Robin, you've been a real trouper. I couldn't have done this without you. But now it's time for Trivette and I to finish it. So I'd like for you to wait here. Okay? What time do you got? Okay, I got 2:58. So I'll meet you downstairs at... I got me two Texas Rangers. Back up, boys. Back up. Let me have your gun. Now, move. Move! Let's go. Got me two Texas Rangers here, huh? Okay, you guys. Right here. Down the stairs. Let's go. Hey, Rollins! Rollins, look what I got here. We ain't dealing with no invalid in a wheelchair after all. Robin? Ohh! Well, well, look who we got here. A couple of living, breathing Texas Rangers. Oh. Man, you're not going paranoid on me like Gomez. Don't you recognize this guy? This guy brought me down from Fort Worth. Oh, yeah. I saw that little exhibition, remember? Fascinating, isn't it? Here we were, so trusting. So willing to share our fortune. And all the time there was a wolf among us in sheep's clothing. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Stinkin' snitch. You know, I knew there was something funny about this guy. You know, I'm truly sorry about this. Killing really wasn't part of my plan. Especially not you, Cathy girl. Ah! Rollins! Hey, Rollins! Arrhh! I'm gonna rip your bloody head off. Not quite that easy. Oh! Oh, thank God! Thank God. Thank God. What about it, Walker? You must've been as surprised as they were when those lights went out. No. Actually, I was counting on you. You're my secret weapon. Did you really think I could do it? Didn't you? Yes, sirree! That little lady knows that gourmet chili when she eats it. You bet your booty she does. Well, she's eating it like there's no tomorrow. Oh, there's a tomorrow. Plenty of them, as a matter of fact. Hey, C.D., how about another bowl? Yes, ma'am. We got ten gallons of it left. The kind Mama used to try to make but couldn't. Well, put some more pepper in it. You need to spice it up some. It'll put hair on your chest. You need that, don't you? Come on, Trivette. Aren't you even gonna try it? Are you kidding? No, no. I'm trying to figure out how you guys are eating any of it. Let me smell. Oh, man! Eww! If I eat that, I'm gonna get an angiogram. Well, you'll be eating a lot of it here real soon. Say what? You're going to Huntsville. We still have to bust that drug ring. Blackjack awaits your arrival. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. You were the one that tore up the chain letter. Come on, criminal. Aah! Get... Hey, don't laugh. Oh. Say goodbye. Hey, I'll call you!
