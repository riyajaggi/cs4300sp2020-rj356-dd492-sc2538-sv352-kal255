 I can't believe that termite's doing business in my territory again. I must not have explained it to him clear enough the first time. When you say "explain," you talking about the time you put the snake in his house? I said someone put the snake, not me. Right. All right, what are we gonna do? We're gonna climb down. No, wait, wait. I got the plan. What plan?

 We're gonna push this boulder down the hill with your truck. Yeah, that way, we'll give them a bang for their buck, man. Won't work. What do you mean, it won't work? See, that's what I mean by, "You never listen to me." You're too stubborn. It will too work. All right, come on, baby. Check this one out. This is a beauty. I got three more cases of these. But you gotta order now. Drop your guns, guys. Walker? Would you mind tying them up, Cobalt?

 I'm a little tired. With what? Be creative. Belts. Belts. Come on! Walker, here we come! Waaah! Woo-hoo! Here we come! Look out! Baby, what a ride! I told you he was crazy. But determined. Told you it wouldn't work. What do you mean? I'm a little late, but it worked. No, it didn't. Yeah. Where's the other guys? They ran off. Do you mind staying with the guns and the money while I go chase them down? Okay. Keep your hands on the wheel! The hell I will. You just violated the sanctuary. I don't care what I'm violating. I'm getting my daughter, Emmi. There's no one here by that name. That's a lie! Go home! You're not wanted here. Not without Emmi. Stop that! That's my dad! All right, let's go. It's all right. Everything's under control. Emmi. Oh, my God. You shouldn't have come here, Daddy. I had to, baby. I can't let you do this. I am old enough to decide for myself. No, you're not. You're still a child. I just turned 18. I'm a woman now and... And I'm carryin'. That's all the more reason for you to come home. Damn to you who covets the lamb. She's chosen us now. A flower that's come to seed. I suggest that you leave. We have her best interests at heart. Is that why you put her out on street corners, begging? Raising money for the flock. It's God's work. What kind of church do you call this? Guard towers? Razor wire? It's more like a prison to me. It's a haven of peace. Protecting us from the beast. Outside is Satan's world and here, it's clean. No crack. No HIV. No rock'n'roll. And no freedom. I want my daughter back. She's just reached her 18th year. Let it be her decision. Tell me, child. Do you wish to depart with your father? No. I made up my mind. This is my home now. Go home, Daddy, and forget about me. I'll pray for your soul. Emmi. No. Come on, now. Quiet. Here she comes. Surprise! Congratulations, hon. The even years are always the best. Twenty-eight winters. It's a good year to have babies. Happy birthday. Walker, whose idea was this, anyway? Uh, it was Trivette's. You big fibber. It was his. You've been so busy with this Hansen murder trial... Yeah, we figured if we didn't do something, you'd end up sticking a candle in a cupcake at home. Yeah, the torrid nightlife of the big city DA. You got my number. Oh, here. Oh... What is this? It belonged to Aunt Ruthie, Uncle Ray's wife. It was her good-luck bracelet. That's Indian medicine. It'll bring you love and happiness. Oh, it's beautiful. Oh. Thank you. Mwah. All right, come on. Make a wish. What are you smiling about? I'll bet I know what you wished for. What I wished for was my key witness who failed to show today. Why? What happened? He doesn't want to get involved. And all the marshals were busy with other things. We'll serve that subpoena. Couldn't ask you to do that. Okay. What's the catch, Alex? Catch? No catch. It's just you guys have more important things to do. It'll be a birthday present. Who is he? His name is Luke Meggs. He's a hog farmer. On the morning of the murder, he was out collecting swill to feed his stock. He saw Hansen run from the murder scene. Only now, he won't come forward to testify. Okay, what is it you're not telling us? What am I not telling you? That's what I'm afraid to find out. Leave her alone. Why are you always so suspicious of her? Thank you, Trivette, for trusting me. Yeah, no problem. Piece of cake. Okay, traitor. I want some cake. I knew it. I wonder which one's Meggs. I'll take the little guy. Lute Meggs? We have a bench warrant which requires you to appear in court to testify in the state's case against Clyde Hansen. Man, like I told them other four guys, I ain't testifying. Other four guys? You hear me? I ain't goin' nowhere with you! Guess what? He ain't going with us? You got it. Hey. You know who we are? We're Texas Ran... Oh, man. I don't think it's sinking in. We can do it the hard way. Meggs, get down from there! Uh-uh. No way, man. Meggs, get down from there. Get down. Do you got him? Do you got him?! I got him! I'm cuffing him! Oh, man, his wrists are too big. Stop! Let me go! Get his arm. I got it. Okay. I got it. Stop. Let me go. Cuff him. Let me go! All right! Got him? Yeah. Okay. Relax, Meggs. Relax. Too suspicious, huh? Miss Cahill? I'm Hank Berrigan. You're the district attorney, right? My God, what happened to you? Come in. Then when her mom died, Emmi just went wild. She wouldn't listen to nothing. She wouldn't listen to nobody. It... It's like... sh-she blames me for Laurie's death. Then she runs off and joins this cult. Some sort of religious group? Oh, hell, that's just a cover. I mean, they call it Heaven Compound, but this Deacon Bodie, he just uses people for begging. He uses women too. Emmi's pregnant. How old is she now? She's 18. I-I mean, all the young women in there, he's got 'em all carrying. He runs the place like a warlord. All the other people in there, they're all old, except for the guards, and they're just a bunch of cons. Mr. Berrigan, I'd like to help you, but right now, I'm in the middle of a murder trial. And besides, you said yourself, legally, she's an adult. Ma'am, I-I wouldn't be here if I wasn't desperate. It's just that... I lost my wife... and I don't wanna lose my daughter too. All right. I'll go out there and I'll see if she'll talk to me. Thank you. Whew! What is that? Whoa! Where have you fellas been? You smell like a packing house in July. It's not us, it's him. Man, I gotta get outta here. Ah, man, that's terrible! It's every dadgum one of you. That's what it is. I'm gonna have to burn these clothes, man. Where do you get the time to eat Chinese food? Hey. I thought Rangers were supposed to be tough, guys? Get us a fumigator, fellas. That's what we need most. You smell like you got a possum under each arm. My best shirt. Excuse me, but is this New Canaan? Yes. Are you looking for Deacon John? No... The pretty ones always come looking for him. Actually, I was looking for Emmi Berrigan. Hunters. I'll take you to Emmi. Have you lost it? That's live ammo! Hey, how they gonna train if their powder's dry? I want these men to smell death. Come on, keep down and rush! Got some trouble on the compound. Some woman assistant DA showed up. She's talking to Emmi. She breached the perimeter? How did that happen? I don't know. She wants to see you. Tell the men to stand down. We'll finish the exercise later. Come on. All right. Stand down! Regroup! I am alive. Oh! Isn't he just to die for? Deacon, um, this is Alex Cahill. Daddy sent her. And Alex, this is Deacon John Bodie. What brings you here to see Emmi? Actually, I'm here on behalf of her father. He wants to press charges for aggravated assault. Well, I assume you have witnesses to prove that. You see, the way I saw it, Mr. Berrigan tripped getting out of his car. Is that the way it happened, Emmi? Look, Miss Cahill, I know my daddy doesn't understand, but I don't want any trouble. This is my home now. All right. Fine. I'll be happy to leave. But first, I'd like to talk to Emmi in private. Fine. Inside the compound, if you don't mind. Let go of me! Miss Cahill. He was only concerned for your safety. Once that gate locks down for the night, it gets charged with 10,000 volts. So open it. It's on a timer. So when does it open again? Six a.m. Spend the night in heaven, Miss Cahill. I need to get to a phone. We have no phones and no television. We have the Bible. I think you're making a mistake. You're wrong about the deacon, Alex. He loves me. And he loves us all. You can go back now, child. I'll see her out. But I wanted to say goodbye to Alex... Ah-ah-ah. Do what the deacon says. Sure. Well, take care, Alex. You too. Well, now. You've had the night to talk with the girl. Are you satisfied? Yes. Satisfied that you've committed a felony. What are you talking about? Statutory rape. Emmi just had her birthday. She's seven-months pregnant. She also told me about the paramilitary drills, lack of sleep. You're using mind control on Emmi and about half the people here. It's a pity you feel that way. What are you doing? Giving you time to reflect. Are you crazy? I'm a district attorney. This is kidnapping. Man's laws pale in the eyes of God. Take her away. You can't do this! Oh, you'd be surprised what I can do. Let's go. Come on. Hey, loosen up. I said, I'm going. We're lucky the DA got a continuance. But if Alex doesn't show up soon, I know that judge is gonna order a mistrial. It's not like Alex. She'd never miss a court date. Especially this one. I called her apartment, checked her office. Nobody's seen her since yesterday. You heard Hansen swear he wouldn't stand for a conviction. Yeah. You think that now we got Meggs, he'd make a move on Alex? He's killed three already, and his gang's still at large. Let's get out to her place. Fellas, be careful. Let me hear from you, will ya? How'd you know that was there? I've been over here a few times. Oh. To discuss cases. Yeah. God, Alex is neat. She's wearing her bracelet. Then she was home last night. Seems that way. Alex, this is Walker. We got Meggs. Call me before court. Miss Cahill, this is Hank Berrigan. Did you get back from Decatur yet? What happened out at the compound? 555-5736. Who's Hank Berrigan? What's the compound? It could be that religious cult down in Decatur. Let's call him. 555-5736. What the hell are you doing? You locked up that DA? Damage control. She was gonna file charges. Well, as your lawyer, I am telling you to let her go now. Kidnapping is a federal crime. We don't need the feds out here. What's the difference? Later, now. Confrontation's inevitable. Hey, whoa! Wait a minute! This is me you're talking to. Remember? Bodie, I knew you before you found Jesus and learned how to shoot a Mac 10. Well, I get the feeling that you're not a true believer, Brother Webber. Brother Webber? Look, when I signed onto this, it was nice and tight. You held the Bible, I kept the books. We roped in the old folks for their savings, and the kids brought us cash off the streets. 1.2 million that first year, and all of it tax-free. Donations and penance from my brethren. Yeah, well, your brethren, half of them are knocked up now. And those mercs you brought in are about to blow, especially Luther. I don't like him and I don't trust him. Listen to me, you disbarred hack. It is your soul that cries out for redemption. And it is for the blessed, like myself, to show you the way. The days of wrath are coming, my friend, where the wicked shall burn in the fires of Gehenna. But you have nothing to fear. For the deacon protects you. Okay, Bodie. And to put it in terms that you can understand, we just brought in 10 more retirees. We are close to 3 million, 6. If that DA wants to shut down our escrow accounts, she can. Now, we don't want that, do we? I can see why Berrigan was so spooked. This Deacon John Bodie must think he's Lord of the Flies, man. Did you run him through NCIC? Yeah, but "Bodie" must be an alias, 'cause I got zip. Hey. Hold it right there. What's your business here, Ranger? Intruders outside the main gate. Roger. We got lockdown in here. You stay there. No! Let me outta here! That looks like our boy. Rangers. See what I'm telling you? It's high voltage. What can we do for you? An assistant district attorney, Alex Cahill, was out here yesterday. She was visiting an Emmi Berrigan. That's right, they spent about an hour talking. Then Miss Cahill took Emmi back to her father. Is there something wrong? Not if you don't object to a search. Feel free to walk the entire compound. There's just one thing. What's that? Because of the children, we ask that you keep your weapons outside. Not a problem. Hello. Has anybody seen Emmi today? No. Emmi Berrigan? No. Uh-uh. Hi. Excuse me, have you seen this lady around here? Hm? Uh-uh. I ain't see her. How 'bout you? Well, I hope you enjoyed your day in heaven. Like I said, nothing to hide. Right. Remember his face, Luther. His is the face of death and destruction. Hey, what's with you? You never give up your gun. Bodie's fingerprints. Now we can run them and find out who this guy really is. Yeah, and then what? Then we're gonna get a warrant and tear this place apart, piece by piece. She's in there. I know it. Hey. Fingerprints came back from Athens. This Bodie's got a rap sheet as thick as the Old Testament. Real name is Dwayne Tyrell Blaine. Did time for armed robbery, assault and rape. Did his last stretch at Eglin for possession of stolen weapons. So that's where he got his old-time religion. Yeah. He's got a mail-order doctor of divinity degree. Now, this guy, Morgan Webber, was one of his cellmates. He's a disbarred attorney. He did a nickel for fraud. Specialized in bilking old folks out of their pensions. So now he's at New Canaan pulling the same scam. Now, let me ask you something. You wanna hit a fortified compound because of a white-collar warrant? No. I wanna hit it to get Alex outta there. Well, we don't know that for sure. I know it for sure. Now, didn't you say that Bodie did time for stolen weapons? Yeah. Look, I'm just telling ya, cop or no cop, the guy put a damn snake in my bed. And that's the end of that little bedtime story. Cobalt. Yeah? Come here. Got a deal for ya. What do you want? There's a religious cult out in Decatur run by a Deacon Bodie. Real name: Dwayne Blaine. I want you to go out there and sell him guns. No way, man. If you do this, I'll have the DA drop all charges against you. Look, no deal, okay? Look, I-I know that guy from prison, right? He's nutso. There's no way I'm going out there. Suit yourself. Naaaah! Get that maniac outta here, okay? Look, I-I-I'm not telling you nothing. Understand? Nothing! "N-O" spells "no," end of story, I ain't going to the compound! The book says the day is coming, my friends. Now, the apocalypse says that the beast will come in many forms. It's coming. He will wear the face of four horsemen: Pestilence... disease... famine and war. Oh, yeah. WOMAN: Amen. That is why we have drawn in here behind these gates. For protection! Amen. Praise God! You are my children. You are my lambs. Our flock must continue to grow. We must welcome newcomers and help all devotees, showing them how to surrender their old, ill-taught prejudices. Amen. To accept... and embrace the love and totalness of being one with us. Who is your father? You are. Who loves you more than your own? You do! Alex? They told me you weren't eating. I'll eat when I'm on the outside. You know, I'd hoped that my words today might be inspirational to you. Inspirational? You are the sickest human being I have ever met. What you are doing to these people is unconscionable. You know, Alex... frankly... your cynicism hurts me. Are you always this difficult? Only when I'm being held against my will. Well, restraints can be lifted. You know... we could use a strong legal mind like yours here at New Canaan. So let me get this straight. This is a job interview. You know, lady, you're bitter. Hell hath no fury, right? Oh, you wanna know about hell. I'll teach you about hell. If you don't get with this program, I mean right now, I'm gonna send you there real soon. You got me? Yes. I can't hear you. Yes, yes, okay. Okay. Hold it right there! Easy, guys. Let's go. Walker! Walker! Walker! I love you. No. One, two, one, two. Sounds good. Stick that in there. Did you have to tape it to my chest hairs? No. Button up. Jeez. S-S-So, what now? Do I just go in there on foot, or what? Not a problem. Trivette, give him your keys. What? What about your truck? They've already seen my truck. Now, come on. Oh, man. Listen, if there's so much as a scratch on my car, you're gonna be dead dog meat, do you understand? Yes, sir. Sorry, we're closed. Just tell Dwayne that... Tell Deacon Bodie Cobalt's here. I got a Cobalt here. What are you doing here? Hey, Dwayne, is that any way to say hi to your old bud, huh? Lose the con talk. I got something going on here. I'll ask you one more time. What are you doing here? I'm just trying to sell you some more hardware, man. I-I got a new ship... Listen to me, you little hemorrhoid. I want you back in that car and outta here. Listen. No lie, man. I've got some really high-tech artillery here. It's the best. T-take a look, huh? In my office. Hey, hey, Dwayne, uh, you know what? I just remembered I left something in the car. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's the matter with you? What, are you carrying? I don't allow guns in my office. No, man, it's nothing like that at all. Tell you the truth, I haven't been feeling... He's gonna blow it. You know, little stomach problems and everything. And I got something in the car... Wait a minute, you little worm. He's gonna find the wire. What are you wearing, huh? A wire? You're wearing a wire on me? It sure is. A wire! Get this cockroach out of my face. I mean now! Dwayne, they were squeezing me real bad, man. You know I'd never turn you over on my own. I swear it. There's no swearing allowed in here. Come on, Dwayne. Hey, man. You know me better than that, man! We're bros, man! He's gotta go down, man. Let's think this out. What are you gonna do with that, man? Huh? Oh, it's just a little Q&A; here with Luther, me... and I think you'll find our style electrifying. Hey. Hey, man, anything you wanna know. What can I tell ya, huh? How many are they? They're just two. Aah! God! Don't do that, man. Please don't do that. That hurts. How many? I swear to God, man, there's just a couple of Rangers. They're all alone in a pickup truck. They got a couple of .44s and a riot gun. That's it. How much do they know? They... They think you got that lady DA in here. You know, I don't think they're sure about it, but I swear to God, even if she was here, I was gonna put you on to the wire, Dwayne. I was gonna jam 'em up. Work a double-cross! I was! Cobalt. Cobalt, man, hey. Don't lie to me. Okay? See, cause I'm plugged into the truth now. I see things. Hey, I can tell, man. I can really tell that, Dwayne. And I wanna swear to you on my mother's eyes, I would never give you up, Dwayne, never, never. You better be straight with me, man. Come on, man. If you're not... you'll get the shock of your life. Okay, we got Alex in there, Emmi, and three hostages now, if you wanna count Cobalt. Make that two. Looks like he's leaving in a real hurry. Get outta there. Get out, Cobalt. What the hell are you doing? I'm getting outta here. That's what I'm doing. Did you see Alex? No, I didn't see nothing. I don't know nothing, all right? Cobalt, don't lie to me! Okay, okay, man. I didn't see your lady DA. But you're gonna need an army to take that place, man. What's with doing the Indy 500? Hey, I wanted out. He gave me out. I wasn't gonna stick around to find out why, man. But he found the wire! Why'd he let you go so easy, Cobalt? I don't know, man. I just don't know, all right? He knew we'd chase him. Get the DA. I'll lose her on the road. Bodie. Bodie, think for a minute. She is a district attorney. That's like killing a cop. The cops won't hesitate in killing a man of God, huh? You're taking me with you, aren't you? No, there's no time, child. I'll send for you. I'll send for all of you when I find a new place! You can't do this, Bodie. The baby! You're my whole life. Sweetheart, God helps those who help themselves. Bring her out! Close those gates! Sheriff's deputies! Stay here, Hank. We'll serve the warrant and see if they send Emmi out. If not, we'll search the place. The girl's father's with them! Daddy! Daddy! All right. Seal the exits and break out the 60s! You guys come with me. -60 mm! Keep your wits about you, now. Give the alarm! Break open the armory. We're under attack. Ooh! Return fire! They got shotguns out there! Tell Luther to bring out the DA. Bring the girl out. The tower! Hold your fire! Hold it! How bad is it? Bad as it could get, Ranger. And then some. Where's the bullhorn? Front seat. Bodie! What is it, cop? In half an hour, there'll be 50 armed men here surrounding the perimeter. You know what will happen. Yeah. I'll die a hero. No, you'll just die. Is that what you want? What I want is a chopper and enough fuel to reach the border. In return for what? I got a lot of innocent people down here. If I don't get what I want, I'm gonna start executing one every hour. Starting with her. One hour from now, or she dies. There's gotta be a way in. This compound's less than a year old. We've got six minutes. We need to buy some time. You got five minutes to live, lady. How does it feel? You kill a DA and you're signing your death warrant. Well, if I don't, I'm signing it too. Still, it'd be a shame to waste you before I've had a chance. A chance for what? To show you why all those little girls down there think I'm the Second Coming. You're a pig! Well, that may be, but I'm alive. And in four minutes more, you'll be dead. We got the chopper for you, Bodie. How do I know you're not lying? Because I don't want anyone killed. They're putting larger fuel tanks on the chopper so you can make it all the way to Mexico. How soon? Well, not until morning. They're flying it in from Fort Davis. No way! Those terms were unconditional. A chopper now, or she dies. You just do what you have to do, Bodie. Well, what's it gonna be, Bodie? Freedom or a slab down at the morgue? All right. But if this is a scam, she's dead. So, what's our next move? We wait until dark, then you and I go in. Uh, Ranger, that fence is hot enough to cook ya. Sheriff, I want you to contact DWP and have them turn off the power grid at exactly 12:02. You got it? 12:02. You got it. Hey, partner, that's pretty risky. Who's gonna check to see if the electricity's off? You're the rookie. Yeah. Post five out of power! Let's get that power back on, boys! What the hell is going on? Get the generator up, now! I knew they couldn't be trusted. It's that Ranger. It's that Ranger. He's up to something. Just take it easy, man. Maybe it's just what it is. A power failure. Well, if I go, it all goes. Look, man. Don't blow it now, huh? Now, pull yourself together. This is perfect. They can't see you in the dark either. Look, we've got all the money. While everybody's running and gunning, now is the perfect time to use that tunnel. Just you and me. Post two more men on the fence! Or just me. Thanks for the advice, counselor. All right, look alive. Gunshot. We got gunfire. Hey! Stop or I'll shoot! Aah! Nice shooting, Tex. Check at the south gate. Watch out! Check those guys over at the fence when you get back. All right, I'll see you next time around. Both of 'em. Yeah. Oh, it's gonna be okay. Walker's here. It's gonna be okay. Don't let anybody in. Sorry I didn't have time to convert you, my dear. I do love a good challenge. I'm sorry, I just can't leave any witnesses. Especially the unconverted. Go to hell. You first. What do you think you're doing going on a dang-fool mission without letting me know? Don't you ever do that again! Okay? If you won't, I will. Mm.
