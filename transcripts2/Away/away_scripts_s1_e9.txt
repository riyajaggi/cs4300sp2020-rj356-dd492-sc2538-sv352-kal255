 Hello. Okay. Okay. I'll be right there. Did the water system break? Yes. Yes, it did. Okay, Lu. You ready with the bag? Yes. I think that's it. That's it? That's all 16 chambers? Uh-huh.

 What have we got? Twenty-four ounces, maybe. That's not enough to get us through two days. Even if we wanted to slingshot now, we'd be dead by the time we dock with Pegasus 2. Lu, is there any other way we can try and purify our urine? You mean the magical formula I've been hiding to turn urine into water and wine? Funny, Lu. Took the words out of my mouth. All right, listen up. We have 72 hours to solve this problem. So let's set our timers so we can stay one step ahead of our dehydration, because the next six hours will be our best before the symptoms set in.

 As Emma will recall, dehydration is quite unpleasant, and it makes it very difficult to concentrate. So, we need to alert Ground and let them know. If there is anything complicated to try, this is their best window. Wow, since when did you become the expert? Well, I have an obsession with all things water. Yeah, but plants and humans are different. Plants probably last longer. My obsession with water didn't start with my plants. It started with the death of my birth parents from dysentery. I didn't know. Yes, well, without proper hydration, dysentery is quite a horrible way to go, and I... don't talk about it much. How about the, uh, bladders of water that are surrounding the ship? - Through the walls? - Yeah, absolutely not. Why? Why can't we? Because it's impossible. I'll get on it with Ground. The impossible's where we're at. As we all know, the Atlas was designed with bladders of water located just inside the outer walls of the ship to protect the astronauts from radiation. We have teams right now working on extracting water from inside the walls of the crew quarters, where gravity can aid the collection. This is extremely risky. There's only one inch between the inside wall and the wall outside the ship. And there's a 50-50 chance the astronauts don't puncture the bladder and get water... they hit space. Ryan, you and your team, keep looking for ways to extract water from inside the ship. - There's no idea too crazy at this point. - Right. The rest of us are gonna work on extracting water from outside the ship. Okay, but how do we deal with the impossible problem of getting water out of the hull in 2.7 kelvin temperatures? That's why you joined NASA, isn't it? To solve impossible problems? What about a thermodynamic pump? Uh, we could take the heating coil from the WRS. Start combing for parts. Hey, guys, I... I just want you to know I'm okay. Everyone's working hard to solve this thing. And, um... spirits are... strong. Sorry... Um, I think about you guys every moment. You keep me fighting. I love you both so much. You have an update? Yeah. They've sent the instructions for drilling in crew quarters. They're working on other options, but Darlene specifically wanted you to know that Matt's working on it. Must be hard knowing how terrified they are for you. Hey, I suppose that's the one good thing about not letting people get too close to you. You can't destroy any lives if you die. I'm sure your death would destroy a life or two, Ram. I think about you guys every moment. You keep me fighting. I love you both so much. Hey. Thank you so much for being here, Mel. Of course. I'm here too. You guys are both the best. Hey, maybe we should see a movie today, huh? Do something to take your mind off things. - What's playing, Cass? - How would I know, Mom? I meant, let's look it up, sweetie. I don't really think I could sit through a movie right now. Do you think something terrible happened? I'll go get it. Um... Afternoon, ma'am. I'm looking for Lex. I feel really crappy about the way I acted. It was a real coward move. Yeah, it was. It's just... when... they said on the news that Pegasus was missing, it brought back the day the guys in dress greens knocked on our door to tell us my dad was missing. I spent the next three days just... sitting around, freaking out, just kinda waiting for the unthinkable. I didn't wanna go through that again. Why didn't you just tell me that? I guess I hadn't figured it out yet. But then I was talking to my mom this morning, and she reminded me that I wasn't going through it. You are. Look, I get it if you never wanna talk to me again. But I want you to know I made a mistake. And it won't happen again. I just really need everyone in my life to be solid right now. Everything's so messed up. My mom could die of dehydration. And yeah, I got tested for CCM. - You did? - Yeah. My results come back soon. I could find out that I have it. So you should probably think about that before you make me any promises. I don't have to think about anything, Lex. How did you get through those three days? When you were really scared. Before the unthinkable happened. Rubber tubing, as close as we can get to one-eighth inch diameter. Well, I don't see that size here. We need to build a suction to get the water out of the walls once we drill. Common room toilet has suction. I'm not joking. It's the best suction on the ship. I suppose it will fall on me to extract it from the toilet. That's actually not a bad idea. Horrible idea. Why? No, not the toilet. Toilet is fantastic. Drilling into the walls, that's... It's crazy. But at least it is an idea, right? Well, what's the worst that could happen, Mish? You never heard of Spektr? Oh, Misha, no one wants to hear about Spektr right now. Oh, I'd like to hear about Spektr. Lu, we need to get as many collection bags as you can find. - You too, Ram. - Yeah, I got it. Misha, please. Spektr is a... is a Russian ghost story. Only problem, it actually happened. In 1997, the space station Mir was hit by an approaching freighter. The module that was punctured was called Spektr. Yeah. Story always starts with a... This is the sound of air rushing out of the capsule into the vacuum of space, as astronauts feel change of pressure in ears and wait for their brains to explode. Their brains didn't explode, they were able to get out of the module and close it off in time. - Right. - So what you're saying is if we mistakenly drill in the wrong place... And we hear a hiss, we get the hell out. So if there is anything you really care about in the crew quarters, you should probably go and get it now. - Do you have anything for us? - We're close. How close? Thirty minutes. The crew's ready to drill, Matt. I need to know if there's another option. Now. The astronaut will leave the airlock holding the pump, and take the 12-foot spacewalk to the first valve. The challenge is getting the water out of the hull of the ship - in temperatures close to absolute zero. - Yeah. So we repurposed the heating coil from the water reclaimer. The hope is that we can get the water hot enough once it hits space to get it out of the hull of the ship. All right, now remember, this is our first test run. We haven't gotten any of the kinks out yet. That's the sound of water turning into gas as it exits the ship. And once it hits space, it immediately becomes crystals of ice. That's a great sound. It means the pump is getting warm enough to break the ice down. This is good. This is really good. Commander Green, we're go for Plan A. Report back as soon as it's accomplished. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses. Is this helping? Not really. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. If it's not your thing, it's not your thing. What happened after your dad died? - What do you mean? - Everyone keeps telling me to... have faith and keep hoping. But what happens if my mom does die? What will it feel like? It's pretty much the worst thing you'll go through in your life. Nothing will make sense. You'll be pissed off. Sometimes you won't even know if you wanna keep living. Yeah. That's pretty much what I thought it'd be like. But it does get better. Really? But then that kinda messes you up even more, 'cause... in a way, you want it to keep hurting. At least if it hurts, you're not forgetting them. It really sucks when you start to forget them. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Okay, um... we're looking at 368 millimeters down from SB-2. And 165 over from RB-12. Try to calm your breath, Lu. I'm sweating like a pig. This is the expression, is it not? Yes. Just deep breaths in and out. Come on. Okay. This is it. Commander, check my work, please. That's it. That's the spot. If you need an extra pair of eyes, Ram, I'm here. - Get out! Get the hell out! Go! - Quick. Move. Go! - Come on! - Let's go. - Anything? - No. Here it is. "Objective was not achieved. Procedure resulted in loss of vacuum. Until we can get back in and plug the hole, we have lost the crew quarters." Darlene. George, Darlene... I know what you guys are gonna do in there. Please don't make this any harder than it already is, Matt. It's not time to prepare speeches. Not yet. We cannot give up on them. - We are not giving up. - It has to be done. If there's any hope for a future mission to Mars, we... Fuck future missions. I am sorry. Shit. Fuck... You okay? I was content to die on Mars, but not here. Misha, you have any vodka? Hmm? Vodka. Mmm... Something is wrong with me. Really. I... I have ten seconds to get most important thing... This is what I grab. No, please. If we survive, please don't tell anybody, because if you do, they will kick me out of Russia. I'm serious. I don't get it. What's so funny about dying? What's it like to die of dehydration? Um... Well, it's generally not the worst way to go. - That's good to know. - Yes. Well, when the initial feeling of thirst subsides, there's generally no pain, as you're dizzy and light-headed. Though it will be a slower death because we have food. It's funny, the... That obsession that... Brought me down this path is the way I will... Well... It's from Ground. Go ahead. Open it. You don't have to. I'll tell you what it says. Ground wants us to send a few beautiful last words. Something like, uh... "The heroes of Mission Atlas don't want their death to be in vain." La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah. It's actually from Matt. He says, "Don't lose hope. I have an idea." - Matt's back to Mission Control? - Yeah, everyone's working together now. What's he saying? What's his idea? Both astronauts will charge their spacesuits with static electricity. - I don't understand. - They're making the suit static. What are you using to charge it? We built a static electricity generator. Real easy to do. Just look it up on YouTube. They'll be able to build the same thing on the Atlas. - How we doing, Freddie? - Uh... - Should be good to go. - Great. Once charged, astronaut one will open the valve. A gas will emerge and immediately turn into crystals of ice. We're not recreating that here, but the idea is that the ice will react the same way as water and be attracted to the negative ions on the suit. Negative ions in the spacesuit attract the water. ...wrangle the ice towards the open door in the airlock, where astronaut two's negatively charged suit will further attract the ice and he'll be there ready with bags to collect it. Has anything like this ever... No, it hasn't. I know. I'm suggesting... we try and save our astronauts using a fourth-grade science experiment. Coordinate instructions with Matt for Atlas. It's their call if they wanna try this. Of course they'll try it. It's all they've got. Make sure we have their last words before they open that airlock. Thank you so much. Maybe this'll help take your mind off things. Oh! Yum! I haven't eaten all day. Mmm. What? You're really cute when you eat. You've got a... Thanks. That's, like, the fourth time Melissa's called. Maybe she has news? You're gonna have to talk to her eventually. "Astronaut A walks 12 feet to the valve, opens it, conducts ice through space to airlock door, where astronaut B is waiting with collection bags." You want me to walk you through again? I think we're good. I wish there was more to walk through. Oh, Emma, there's a personal message for you from Matt. I love you, but you already know that. I know what I'm asking you guys to do is insane, but insane is my only hope of seeing you again. Now, don't get me wrong. I see you. You're with me all the time. But I want the real thing. I'm scared I'm never gonna see you guys again. Don't think like that. But I do. I can't help it. Misha said you can't have both: family and the mission. That you have to leave something behind in order to survive. Don't you dare leave us, Em. Don't you dare. Hey. Hey. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. And you make sure Ram takes care of you out there. I know you'll take care of him, but make sure he knows you come first. That's an order, and I know you won't give it... but I had to say it. Hey. Hey. You gotta go. We'll be waiting. Hate to sour the mood. Wow. It can get more sour? That's exciting. I've written these last words to Ground. Any one of you like to add to it? I've kept it to the point. Whatever you write is okay with me. It's perfect, Lu. Shall we join hands? Help us, God. Give us strength to combat fear and despair. Show us how to put our pain into perspective. Teach us to have faith in the new day that is coming. Thank you, God... for today's blessings, tomorrow's hope, and for your abiding love. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Commander Green. It, uh... sucks not to be able to go out there with you. - Next time, Misha. - No. No, I already had my last spacewalk. If it was your last, I'm honored that I got to be the one to walk it with you. Thank you, Emmochka. I... cannot think of any better astronaut to take my place. Ram, ready? Put your trust in this one. You'll be fine. I know. I know. Ready? Ready. Begin decompression. Gosh. I forgot how awesome the sky is. When I was a kid... my mom used to say that... "Whenever you're down, look up. It'll make you realize just how big and beautiful the world is." If she dies... will it ruin the sky for me? I don't wanna be scared or sad every time I look at it. Maybe you'll just see your mom looking down at you. Look, she's not dead, Lex. Don't give up on her. I just... I wish I could... stop thinking about her. It's like this constant pit in my stomach. I guess church and chili aren't a cure for everything. But they definitely helped. Thank you. Wow. Kissing definitely works better for forgetting. Then I think we should definitely keep kissing. Hey, how's Lex? She's good. - Matt... - It's not good, Mel. The... the mission? I don't know. I don't know what's gonna happen. Okay, um... Well, I'm... I'm here for you. We're... we're here for you, whatever happens, Matt. Thanks. Just give her a hug from me, okay? But don't tell her anything yet. Yeah, you got it. Incoming from Atlas. I gotta go. I'll call you back. We just got their last words. Would you like to be the first to read them, Matt? I can guess what they say. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. It's my first-ever spacewalk, in space, unsimulated. I got you. Good, 'cause I'm kind of freaking out right now. You're gonna love it. Yeah. - I don't wanna die, Emma. - You won't. Not anymore. Anymore? Come on. You didn't really wanna die, did you? You know, I used to think that if my life ended in sacrifice for something great, something bigger than myself, for my country, science, history... it would be the epitome of a life well-lived. What changed? You. Ram... Please... you can't say that. I have to. I have to say it in case we die. I... I need you to know that... I'm gonna be fighting out there. I'm gonna be... fighting to remain in the world with you. Decompression complete. Okay. Ready? Let's do this. Come on, Rohit. Come on. Oh... my... God. This is incredible. It's just the two of us out here now. We're all that matter. No one else in the world. We're gonna live.
