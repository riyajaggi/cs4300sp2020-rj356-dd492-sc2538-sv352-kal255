 {\an8}How are you doing, Mumbai? Miss your beauty already. That goes for the rest of my country too. Well, it looks like it's gonna be a smooth ride thanks to our very awesome Commander Emma Green. Come, say hello to the people of India. Okay, so... Now for the question of the day. This one comes from Aadav, seven years old, of Calcutta. Hello from Atlas. As most of you already know, I was born in the Central Region of Ghana,

 a town called Apam, just outside of the capital city of Accra. And here we have planted the first seed that will grow on the Red Planet, in soil from my native land. And behind me is what are... Oh, sorry. I'm still trying to get used to this zero-G thing. Ah, there's my colleague, Misha. Thank you, Misha, for laughing at me. My pleasure. Anytime you need it, Kwesi. Right... I guess these are the rites of passage of being a rookie. I could not be more proud... to be your husband right now. And I... your wife.

 Where is Lei? Come, your mother wants to say hi before we have to go out there. Hi, Mom! You look tired. It has been too exciting to sleep. Everyone has so many questions. I have to answer them all for you, and the Motherland. But sleep is still important. Um... I have to go now. Good luck. Thank you. I am honored to speak to you from the first hours of the mission to Mars. So I saw that extra credit you did for Mr. Crombie. - Yeah. - Nice! It's good. I like him. - Is it yummy? - Yeah. - Hey, Alexis. - Hey. - Come on in. - Morning. Morning! You remember my daughter, Cassie? You guys hung out a bit when you were little. I remember. I'm so excited you're here. I always wanted a sister. Uh, okay, take it slow, Cass. - What can we get you for breakfast? - We don't have sugar cereal. Yeah, so sorry. Just the healthy stuff. Are you okay with oatmeal? I think I'll just eat something at the hospital, if that's okay. Wanna see my room? Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. But can we go soon? Yeah, of course. Let me go get my stuff together. - Thanks. - Yep. Your mom's going to Mars? - Yeah... - My mom wanted to go too, but then she had me. Can you feel my hand? Yes. I can't believe that's your wife up there. Believe it. How about now? Can you feel my hand? No. Now? Is that bad? Dr. Madigan will be in later to go over your neuro vitals. How about now? Negative return. Flight course is on track. Initiate gravitational systems. Partial solar panel separation, go. Water recycling system fired up and working. Carbon and oxygen levels are good. Ready to make gravity happen? Yes, I am. Let's deploy those sleeping pods. Centrifugal rotation, go. The crew quarters now have gravity. All major systems are nominal. Solar panels are warmed up and ready to go. Zarya array, go. Unity. Deploy Unity. Deploy Zvezda. Deploy Zvezda. I'm getting a negative. - Reboot. - Reboot. On it. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm still getting a malfunction code. CAPCOM, do you have different intel? Commander Green wants some information. We'll get back to her with next steps. - And cut the live feed. - Yes, sir. Zvezda didn't fully deploy. Ground is running scenarios and will get back to us with next steps. Are we sure the problem is mechanical? At the moment, yes. At the risk of Misha laughing at me again, is it possible to get to Mars with Zvezda only a quarter deployed? If solar panel doesn't deploy fully, rocket will lose power. We all die. I don't see what is funny about that. We must go outside and fix the problem. Call Ground. Tell them we have no time... No, we are not sending anyone outside until we have absolute confirmation that the problem is indeed mechanical. It is mechanical. - It's not happening. - Really? Well, Misha does have the most experience in this area, so perhaps it is the time... Ground will be getting back to us with instructions. That's the end of it. Yes, ma'am. Sure. Let Ground run three hours of useless scenarios, then tell us we have to do spacewalk. - Hey. - Hey, babe. - I need to talk to you. - What's wrong? Are you alone? Hello, Commander Green. Oh, hi... Dr. Madigan. How are you? Was just about to go over Matt's neuro vitals. Oh. Well, good. I'm glad that I can be here. Okay. So, first I just wanna say that this early in the process, future mobility is always an unknown. An unknown? What do you mean by unknown? The stroke temporarily cut off blood supply to the part of the brain that controls the lower part of your body. Your lower left side was particularly compromised. How compromised are we talking about? Am I looking at mobility issues? Now, we don't know what your cells' ability to recover is yet. Luckily, this hospital has one of the best rehab facilities in the world. We'll get you transferred and started on a full regimen of physical and occupational therapy. How long will I be here, Doc? I need to get back to work as soon as possible. I understand, but the road to recovery can take time. Uh, I'd think in terms of months. You wanna get back as much motor function as you can. This is the place to do it. I know it's difficult, but you're young, and you're in otherwise great health. More than any patient I've ever had, you got what it takes, both mentally and physically, to get through this. I don't know many astronauts, and this is Texas. I will talk to you tomorrow. Call me anytime. - Thank you, Doctor. - Bye, Commander. Okay, so what the hell is happening up there? They cut the live feed. Matt... We can talk about me later. Tell me what's happening up there. There's gonna be some news coming out. We're going to have to do an EVA. I am shocked. Misha and I will plan it out with Ground. They hope to have us out at 1800 hours. If we fail, you know the contingency action plan. What do you mean, if you fail? Get your sea legs. Amateur hour is over. These solar panels are responsible for all of the power on the ship. Now, because of the scale of the Atlas, three panels are necessary to complete the mission. Right now, as we speak, Commander Green and Cosmonaut Popov are getting ready to go outside the ship to fix it. Misha's been in space more than any astronaut in the world. Astronaut Hutch Fulton is with us now to talk about the incredible risks involved in tonight's spacewalk. Hutch, what are the biggest concerns? Yeah, so you're out there, hanging on to a locomotive that's going 17,000 miles per hour. Of course, we're dealing with a solar panel, so there's the extra risk of electrocution. Oh, Hutch is a show-off. No one's gonna be electrocuted. It's the last thing you need to worry about. ...or tiny shards of metal can puncture a suit and create a catastrophic leak. - Turn it off. - Then there's the risk of exhaustion, loss of consciousness... Okay... Look, Lex, every single person on this mission, they're the best in the world at what they do. Misha and your mom are gonna be completely prepared and in total sync before they go out there, I promise. Okay, so the jam is somewhere along section 42 of the Zvezda panel. I mean, it's pretty far out there, but we have to remove it promptly. Otherwise, we risk losing the entire array. What we're looking at is, Misha, you'll leave the airlock first... No. She goes first. Then me. She goes left. Watch the tethers don't get snagged. Watch your suit here. This panel comes from factory sharp. Look, I did nine EVAs. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. We shouldn't have any confusion about who is in charge out there, okay? We have confusion in here. Why wouldn't we have it out there? Because you wouldn't be here if not for Lu and me. None of us would. You really need to start treating her like the commander of this ship. She proved in the first days of mission she's not fit commander, so relax, and don't tell me who to treat like what. You have no idea what I had to sacrifice to get here. Now can I see? Yes, come here, my little star. Now you can see. It's ready. Look. Now she will get up for this. She's waking up. Shh. And she's awake. Who is she, Papa? The most beautiful girl in the world. - Me? - Of course you! Come on, help me. Here, we'll put her here. She's going back to sleep, okay? - Mm-hmm. - C'mon. There. One more. Okay, good girl. How beautiful. Let's continue. Prepare the crew quarters. We'll be shutting down centrifugal rotation at 1530 hours. Copy that. - Is Wang Lu there? - She certainly is. I have some CNSA protocols I need to speak with her about. - Directly. - You're joking? That's an order. Apparently, China need to speak with you directly. You might wanna give them a heads-up that we're all perfectly capable here. Wang Lu here. Over. How are the astronauts doing? We'll be okay. I just needed you to know: the thoughts of the Chinese people are with you. Thank you. Be safe. My Natalya. Hi! I'll get the boys. No.Wait, wait. I want to talk to you. You look nice. I had Botox done. Why? Why would you do that? You have such a beautiful face. What do you want, Dad? Um... We're doing a spacewalk. I see. I forgive you. That's why you called, isn't it? You always call before a spacewalk. This time I know to cut to the chase. Don't say it if it isn't real. You superstitious bastard. You think my forgiveness will help you out there? No. It helps me in here! Then I forgive you. Happy? All is forgiven. - I'll let the kids know you called. - Nata... Don't hang up... Natasha, hello? And don't forget to check your coolant lines. I will. Where's Lex? She's at Annie's. She just texted me to say she's staying for dinner. Okay, I'll call her. I'm glad she's with friends. This is a lot, you know? I know. Decompression in five minutes. Yes, copy. Listen to me. It's just you and Misha out there. Plans don't matter. Mission Control doesn't matter. You gotta work together. You know what's right. And you keep looking ahead, find that next hold. - With the mitts, you're not gonna be as... - Okay, Matt, stop. What, do you just lay there and imagine me hurtling off into the unknown? I love y... Tell me you love me when you get back inside. Okay. Mom? Hey, kid. How are you? Good. Good. You're at Annie's? Mm-hmm. Oh, good. I'm glad that you're there. I... I'm not gonna keep you long. Everything's gonna be okay, right? The spacewalk? Nothing bad's gonna happen to you? I got this. Everything's gonna be okay. It's time for decompression, Commander. Copy. I gotta go, sweetie. Okay. You're my reason. My reason to hold on tight. I love you, Lex. I love you too, Mom. I'll talk to you soon. Would it be all right if I were to pray for you? Absolutely. Anything that might help. May it be your will, God, our God and the God of our fathers, that you lead us toward peace, guide our footsteps towards peace, and make us reach our desired destination for life. May you send blessings in our handiwork and grant us grace, kindness, and mercy in your eyes and in the eyes of all who see us. May you hear the sound of our humble request and bring these travelers safely back to us. Blessed are you, Lord, who hears our prayer. I have complete faith in you. Don't let her kill us. Sixty minutes until full decompression. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for coming by. Of course. I wanted to catch you before they got out there. So, um... I found out today, it looks like I might be here awhile. I'm so sorry, Matt. And I wanted to see how you felt about keeping Lex for the duration. That's what I signed up for. I doubt when you agreed to be Emma's emissary, you thought you'd get another full-time teenager. Yeah, well... if there's anything life has taught me, you don't get exactly what you sign up for. Mmm. Thanks. And I'm sorry. What for? That we lost touch as the kids got older. I always felt bad about that. Switch to a private channel. It's just the two of us out there, Misha. We have to work together. You have to trust me. Look... Spacewalk is like war. You have to trust the man walking with you to save your life, or vice versa. Now... you and I... First time with emergency, you froze. Trust, it's good. It's important. But it must be earned, Commander. You're a go. Open the hatch when you're ready. Care to translate? I took Russian, but I couldn't get past level two. Russian's freaking hard. Hmm. Tether. Okay, that's great. About 20 more feet to Zvezda. Tell them to stop immediately. Commander, hold. Copy. - What is it? - The insulation at B4 is damaged. Something must have happened during the warm-up phase. It will burn right through a suit. Our engineers are seeing damage to the insulation at B4 and B5. Yes, we can see it up here too. Commander, I need you to hold tight. There's an electrical situation there at the base of the array. - Do you copy? - Copy. What's the plan? They wanna know what the plan is. Have them hold there. Hold? Just hold fast. Ground is working on it. Copy. Bullshit! Hey, I thought you were gonna miss it. Dad, I'm scared. Please don't say that you're not. Please don't tell me that you're not gonna let anything bad happen to her. Just be real with me. I'm scared too. So, Commander, what do you suggest? Like you say... just the two of us. What do we do? Wait? This is your area of expertise. If you have a plan, I'll follow it. Good. Okay. We improvise. Try to get past this electrical mess. Okay. How? Make one long tether, and you throw me out there. Okay? - Emma? - No. You throw me. What are they doing? Group Captain Arya, can you let us know what they're doing? We don't actually know. Emma, can you fill us in with what's going on out there? Stand by. That's good, Emma. Let Misha get you out there. Ready? Yeah. On three. One. Two. Three. I'm here. Tether is secure. She did it. Can you get to the problem? I think I've found the issue. The cable has jumped its guide. I can't get enough leverage from here. I'm gonna have to get to it from the other side. How do I do that? Copy that. Let me talk to Ground. What's our next move? - We don't have a next move. - We have to bring them back in. It's reckless at this point, and they've got to be exhausted. It's more reckless to send them back in. I have Matt Logan on the line. - Hey, Matt. - Listen to me. There are cable guides every two feet on the back of Zvezda. - She can tether to them. - We're way off script here. I understand that, but we can't lose any more panels. You need to tell Emma this. You need to tell her right now. Okay, Commander, there's cable guides every two feet under the array to clip onto. Do you copy? Copy. Misha, switch to a private channel. Sure. I can't get to the other side unless I unclip myself. You want to untether? I can do it. You're crazy. No. No, it's too big of a risk. Without proper equipment, all you have to survive is tether. If I push myself off the array, I can grab the edge and pull around to the other side. It's this, or we go back in and risk losing the array. You have to trust me. Then do it, Commander. What the hell is she doing? No. No. No. No. Group Captain Arya, we've lost visual on Commander Green. I repeat. We've lost visual on Commander Green. Misha? Misha, can you see her? Emma? Emma? Commander? I'm here. My tether is secured to the cable guide on the back of Zvezda. Approaching the hinge now. I've reached the problem. Emma! Emma! Emma? Commander Green! - Do you hear me? - Yes. Good. Good. Okay. You have to pull yourself in. Copy. Okay. Okay. Careful. Good. Good. Okay, Commander, now grab my hand. Yes! No, no, no! Untether yourself. Untether from your suit. It's okay. I've got you. Tether is secure. Deploy the array, Ram. It's okay. It's going to be okay, Wang Lu. Bring them in. Return to airlock. Return to airlock immediately. What did you say? In Russian, before we went out. I asked spirit of my wife to watch out for us when we're out there. I'm sorry. I... I didn't realize. I assumed you were divorced. No, um... It was a long time ago. Still, thank her for me. Dad, I have to tell you something. I didn't go to Annie's. Where'd you go? Home. But it didn't feel like home without you guys in it. We're gonna go home again. I promise. We'll go home. You may have to let them go, you know. Your family. Really difficult to have both. Believe me, I... I tried. My condolences. She was too young. Papa! My little star. I can't believe it. It doesn't make sense. I couldn't get home to say goodbye to Mama. I couldn't. I couldn't be with you. If not for your mother... I'm sorry. Will you ever forgive me? Promise you won't ever leave me again. I promise. I promise. Em. Hi. Lex, it's your mom. Wake up. Hi, Mom. That was amazing. It was. I couldn't have done it without you guys. That was you, wasn't it? Who told them about the cable guides. I wouldn't have said it if I knew you couldn't get there. Um, I'm just on the phone. Sorry, Emma. The crew wants to toast you. Okay, I'll be right there. Go. You deserve to be toasted. By the way... I love you, shithead. I love you too. You guys are so weird. Misha? I'm glad we have you thinking for us. Translation, please. Learn the language, please. He said you did very well. Well, to Mars. To Mars. And to Ram... for guiding us out there. And handling Ground. Do you think you're the only one haunted by the sacrifices you made to get here? Hmm? And you, I vouched for you with Darlene, but what you did out there was irresponsible and quite frankly insane. Keep behaving like that, you're gonna get yourself killed. Ram. We all need you alive. I need you alive.
