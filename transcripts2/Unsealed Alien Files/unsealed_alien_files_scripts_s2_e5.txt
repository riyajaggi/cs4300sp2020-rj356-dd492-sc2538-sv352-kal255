 {\an8}THE SOVIET UNION, THE 20th CENTURY'S OTHER SUPERPOWER. IT WAS THE BIGGEST NATION THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN, AND ITS VAST SKIES CONTINUE TO BEAR WITNESS TO THOUSANDS OF UFO SIGHTINGS. BUT THE SOVIET REGIME WAS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS SECRECY. >> THE SOVIET UNION AND COMMUNIST CHINA HAD THEIR OWN REASONS WHY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE TELLING THEIR PEOPLE ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS. >> MANY OF THESE ALIEN ENCOUNTERS HAD POTENTIALLY DEADLY CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. TONIGHT, WE GO BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN TO INVESTIGATE 50 YEARS OF SOVIET UFO ENCOUNTERS, ON "UNSEALED: ALIEN FILES."

 A GLOBAL EFFORT HAS BEGUN. SECRET FILES HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC FOR DECADES, DETAILING EVERY UFO ACCOUNT, ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. WE ARE ABOUT TO UNCOVER THE TRUTH BEHIND THESE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. FIND OUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW. "UNSEALED: ALIEN FILES." EXPOSING THE BIGGEST SECRETS ON PLANET EARTH. DALNEGORSK. JANUARY 29, 1986. THOUSANDS OF MILES EAST OF MOSCOW, THIS TINY MINING TOWN IS ABOUT TO WITNESS AN EVENT THAT WILL SEND SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE UFO COMMUNITY. HUNDREDS WATCH IN DISBELIEF AS A FIREBALL STREAKS ACROSS THE SKY AND CRASHES INTO A NEARBY MOUNTAIN. NEWS OF THIS MASS SIGHTING WILL QUICKLY SPREAD BEYOND THE NATION'S BORDERS, OPENING THE WORLD'S EYES TO DECADES OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN

 UFO ENCOUNTERS. UNSEALED CASE FILE: THE RUSSIAN ROSWELL. CROWDS QUICKLY GATHER AT THE CRASH SITE, WHERE THEY DISCOVER A SCORCHED CRATER 3 METERS IN DIAMETER, SURROUNDED BY A DEBRIS FIELD OF SMALL METALLIC BEADS. GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES ARRIVE ON THE SCENE AND COLLECT SAMPLES OF THE STRANGE MATERIAL, WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE SOVIET UNION'S TOP SCIENTIFIC MINDS FOR TESTING. THEY ARE DUMBFOUNDED BY THEIR FINDINGS. THE BEADS ARE UNLIKE ANYTHING EVER OBSERVED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE. >> 3 SOVIET ACADEMIC CENTERS AND 11 RESEARCH INSTITUTES ANALYZED THE OBJECTS FROM THIS UFO CRASH. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ATOMS IS DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY IRON IN THIS MATERIAL. RADAR CANNOT BE REFLECTED FROM THE MATERIAL. ELEMENTS IN THE MATERIAL MAY DISAPPEAR AND NEW ONES APPEAR AFTER HEATING. ONE PIECE APPARENTLY DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY IN FRONT OF 4 WITNESSES. >> BUT ONE CHARACTERISTIC ABOVE ALL LEAVES THE SOVIETS IN DISBELIEF. THE BEADS EXHIBIT ANTI-GRAVITATIONAL PROPERTIES. THEY ARE LEFT WITH ONLY ONE POSSIBLE ANSWER. A DECLASSIFIED 1989 CIA REPORT ON SOVIET UFOs STATES THAT "SCIENTISTS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT THAT CRASHED...WAS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPACE VEHICLE CONSTRUCTED BY HIGHLY INTELLIGENT BEINGS." AN AMERICAN JOURNALIST CLAIMS TO HAVE SMUGGLED SAMPLES OF THE MATERIAL BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. >> AMERICAN JOURNALIST GEORGE KNAPP, HE WAS THE ONLY BROADCAST JOURNALIST TO GO TO RUSSIA, GET SOME OF THE MATERIALS OF THE DALNEGORSK CRASH, NOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE REFERRING TO AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AS THE RUSSIAN ROSWELL. >> IT'S A NOD TO THE INFAMOUS STORY OF A UFO CRASH NEAR ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO, IN 1947, THAT WAS AT FIRST CONFIRMED BY THE AMERICAN MILITARY, ONLY TO BE LATER DENIED IN A STUNNING ABOUT FACE. IT'S THE EVENT THAT BROUGHT UFOs AND GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACIES INTO THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE WEST. IN THE EAST, THE SOVIETS WOULD ATTEMPT A MORE OPEN POLICY ON UFOs. IN 1967, THE FIRST UFO STUDY GROUP WAS FORMED. ITS LEADERS WENT ON STATE TELEVISION TO APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC TO SUBMIT THEIR STORIES OF UFO SIGHTINGS AND ALIEN ENCOUNTERS. THE RESPONSE WAS OVERWHELMING. BUT LIKE THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIET UNION WOULD PERFORM AN ABRUPT ABOUT FACE ON THE ISSUE, DISSOLVING THE STUDY GROUP AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR, WITH NO EXPLANATION. IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED, THE SOVIETS WOULD MAINTAIN A STRICT CODE OF SILENCE ON THE SUBJECT OF UFOs. WHAT DID THE SOVIET STUDY GROUP DISCOVER THAT FORCED THE KREMLIN TO BRING A SWIFT END TO THE PROJECT? WHAT WERE THEY HIDING? LIKE THE AMERICAN COVER-UP AFTER ROSWELL, SOVIET OFFICIALS ARE QUICK TO DOWNPLAY THE DALNEGORSK EVENT. BUT IN THE LATE 1980s, THE SOVIET UNION ISN'T THE SAME HARDLINE STATE OF DECADES PAST. NEW COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY MIKHAIL GORBACHEV HAS USHERED IN AN ERA OF GLASNOST, OR OPENNESS. PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER AS AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT ON TABOO SUBJECTS, LIKE UFOs. IN THE WAKE OF THE DALNEGORSK INCIDENT, WORD OF DECADES OF SOVIET UFO REPORTS BEGINS TO SPREAD. AND MANY OF THESE HAD DEADLY CONSEQUENCES. THE SOVIET UNION PAID WITNESS TO THOUSANDS OF UFO SIGHTINGS DURING ITS EXISTENCE. BUT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE REPORTS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED OR LOST TO HISTORY. ONE OF THE FEW THAT DID SURVIVE CONTINUES TO HAUNT THE REGION TODAY. UNSEALED CASE FILE: THE DYATLOV PASS INCIDENT. THE URAL MOUNTAINS, 1959. 9 FRIENDS EMBARK ON A CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING TRIP THROUGH A VALLEY KNOWN TODAY AS THE DYATLOV PASS. ALL ARE EXPERIENCED IN SURVIVING EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. NOT LONG INTO THEIR JOURNEY, THE URALS ARE HIT BY A POWERFUL SNOWSTORM. WHEN THE SKIERS FAIL TO ARRIVE AT THEIR DESTINATION, A SEARCH PARTY SETS OUT TO LOCATE THEM. WHAT THEY FIND IS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES. THE RESCUERS DISCOVER A BADLY DAMAGED TENT, BUT NO ONE IS WITHIN. THE GROUP'S BELONGINGS, HOWEVER, ARE THERE, INCLUDING THE GROUP'S CAMERAS AND DIARIES. FURTHER EXAMINATION REVEALS THE TENT HAD BEEN CUT OPEN, FROM THE INSIDE. THE RESCUERS FOLLOW A TRAIL OF FOOTPRINTS TO THE EDGE OF A NEARBY FOREST, WHERE THEY MAKE A GRISLY DISCOVERY. 5 BODIES CLAD IN ONLY THEIR UNDERWEAR, FROZEN IN THE SNOW. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THEY WERE TRYING TO RETURN TO THE TENT. FORENSIC EXAMINATION SUGGESTS THAT ALL EXPIRED FROM HYPOTHERMIA. IT SEEMS THE PARTY EMBARKED ON A BIZARRE MISADVENTURE, DISORIENTED BY THE INTENSE COLD. THAT IS, UNTIL THE REMAINING 4 BODIES ARE DISCOVERED MONTHS LATER. THEIR CAUSES OF DEATH WILL CAST A SINISTER NEW LIGHT ON THE CASE. TWO OF THE NEWLY DISCOVERED BODIES HAVE MAJOR SKULL FRACTURES, AND THE OTHERS CHEST FRACTURES. ONE FEMALE HAS HAD HER TONGUE CUT OUT. THE FINAL REPORT ON THE DYATLOV PASS INCIDENT IS SENT TO A SECRET ARCHIVE, WHERE IT WILL REMAIN UNTIL THE 1990s. WHEN THE FILE IS FINALLY RELEASED, CRUCIAL DOCUMENTS ARE MISSING. THOSE THAT SURVIVE STATE THAT "THE FATAL INJURIES COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ANOTHER HUMAN BEING." AND THAT "HIGH DOSES OF RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION" WERE PRESENT IN SOME ARTICLES OF CLOTHING." WHAT COMPELLED 9 SKIERS TO BURST FROM THEIR TENT AND RUN NAKED INTO A RAGING SNOWSTORM? WHAT CAUSED THE RADIOACTIVITY IN THEIR CLOTHING? AND WHAT INFLICTED THE GRUESOME INJURIES, INCLUDING THE SEVERED TONGUE? MANY THEORIES ARE CONSIDERED-- FROM MADNESS BROUGHT ON BY THE ONSET OF HYPOTHERMIA, TO AN ATTACK BY THE INDIGENOUS MANSI PEOPLE. DURING THE INVESTIGATION ANOTHER GROUP OF SKIERS COMES FORWARD CLAIMING TO HAVE SEEN STRANGE GLOWING SPHERES IN THE SKY DURING THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. NONETHELESS, SOVIET AUTHORITIES DISMISS THE INCIDENT AS DEATH BY MISADVENTURE, CITING THE "ABSENCE OF ANY GUILTY PARTY." BUT MANY UFO EXPERTS NOW POINT TO A GLARING GOVERNMENT COVER-UP OF A DEADLY ALIEN ABDUCTION. >> FROM THAT POINT FORWARD, THE TRUTH EMBARGO STARTS TO DEVELOP. THE SOVIET UNION HAD THEIR OWN REASONS WHY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE TELLING THEIR PEOPLE ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS. >> WHY WOULD THE SOVIETS CENSOR THE DYATLOV PASS REPORTS? WHY DID THE GOVERNMENT NOT WARN THE NATION OF A POTENTIALLY DEADLY UFO THREAT? WHAT DID THE KREMLIN HAVE TO HIDE? THE DYATLOV PASS INCIDENT OCCURS AT A MOMENT WHEN SECRECY MIGHT DECIDE THE FATE OF THE WORLD. IN THE LATE 1940s, THE COLD WAR BEGINS BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND ITS RIVAL SUPERPOWER, THE UNITED STATES. THE TWO NATIONS BEGIN A DANGEROUS NUCLEAR ARMS RACE. IN THE EARLY 1950s, AMERICAN B52 BOMBER SQUADRONS ARMED WITH ATOMIC WEAPONS BEGIN FLYING CONTINUOUS SORTIES TOWARD THE SOVIET HOMELAND, ONLY TO BE CALLED BACK AT THE LAST SECOND. TO COUNTER THIS THREAT, THE SOVIETS EXPAND THEIR NETWORK OF RADAR STATIONS TO DETECT ANY INCURSION INTO ITS MASSIVE AIRSPACE. BUT IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE THESE STATIONS BEGIN PICKING UP MORE THAN JUST AMERICAN BOMBERS. UFOs BEGIN APPEARING WITH INCREASING REGULARITY NEAR THE NATION'S MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. IT'S AN ALARMING TREND THAT WILL REACH A PEAK AT THE END OF THE DECADE. UNSEALED CASE FILE: THE SVERDLOVSK INCIDENT. SVERDLOVSK, UKRAINE. JUNE 1959. SOVIET RADAR DETECTS A UFO APPROACHING A NEARBY NUCLEAR TEST FACILITY. MILITARY PERSONNEL MAKE VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE SAUCER-SHAPED UFO THAT BEGINS HOVERING OVER THE BASE. A FIGHTER JET SCRAMBLES TO MEET THE MYSTERIOUS THREAT. BUT AS IT APPROACHES, THE SAUCER TAKES EVASIVE ACTION, ZIG-ZAGGING OUT OF HARM'S WAY WITH LIGHTNING SPEED, AND THEN RETURNING TO LOOM OVERHEAD. THE STANDOFF CONTINUES FOR 24 TENSE HOURS BEFORE THE UFO FLIES OFF WITHOUT WARNING OR EXPLANATION. THE SVERDLOVSK INCIDENT UNDERSCORES THE DANGER POSED BY UFOs AT A CRITICAL TIME IN HISTORY. RIVAL SUPERPOWERS ARE MAKING THEIR FIRST STEPS INTO A VAST NEW REALM. BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, THE ENDEAVOUR WILL LEAVE BOTH FACED WITH A TROUBLING NEW QUESTION. IS SOMEONE ALREADY OUT THERE? LIKE THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIET UNION SUPPRESSED DECADES OF UFO REPORTS. MANY OF THESE FILES CONTAINED DEADLY SECRETS. BUT ACCORDING TO SOME EXPERTS, IN THE 1960s, THE WORLD'S TWO MOST PROMINENT MEN MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTEMPT TO LIFT THE VEIL OF SECRECY SURROUNDING UFOs. IN THE END, IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR UNDOING. >> WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON IN THIS DECADE AND DO THE OTHER THINGS, NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. BECAUSE THAT GOAL WILL SERVE TO ORGANIZE AND MEASURE THE BEST OF OUR ENERGIES AND SKILLS. >> 1961. PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ANNOUNCES AMERICA'S INTENTION TO LAND A MAN ON THE MOON. POLITICALLY, IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP PACE WITH THE SOVIET UNION IN THE SPACE RACE. BUT MANY EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT BEHIND THE SCENES, THE MOON MISSION WAS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN NATIONAL PRIDE. >> THE REAL REASON WHY PRESIDENT KENNEDY WANTED TO GET MEN TO THE MOON WAS THAT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS A WAY IN WHICH THE NATIONAL SECURITY APPARATUS IN THE UNITED STATES COULD SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT UFOs. FROM THE EARLY 1950s, NATIONAL SECURITY PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES WERE AWARE THAT THERE WOULD BE ALIEN BASES ON THE MOON. >> THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THE SOVIETS HAVE THEIR OWN SECRET ALIEN FILES AND SUSPECTS THEY ARE WORKING WITH RECOVERED UFO TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR TOP-SECRET BASE AT KAPUSTIN YAR. BUT THE CIA KEEPS THE MOST SENSITIVE UFO INTELLIGENCE HIDDEN FROM THE PRESIDENT. KENNEDY REALIZES THAT THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. IMMEDIATE ACTION IS NEEDED TO PREVENT THE MOON FROM FALLING INTO ENEMY HANDS-- HUMAN OR OTHERWISE. HE DECIDES TO USE THE MOON MISSION AS MEANS TO FORCE THE CIA TO BEGIN SHARING VITAL UFO INFORMATION. UNKNOWN TO KENNEDY, KHRUSHCHEV, TOO, IS CONCERNED ABOUT ALIEN ACTIVITY, LEADING TO AN UNPRECEDENTED SHOW OF TRUST BETWEEN THE TWO GLOBAL RIVALS. NOVEMBER 12, 1963, SOVIET PREMIER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAD AGREED WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY THAT THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES WOULD JOINTLY LAUNCH MISSIONS TO THE MOON, AND THAT PART OF THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRED THE INTELLIGENCE DIVISIONS OF BOTH THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES TO SHARE ALL INFORMATION CONCERNING UFOs. >> BUT JUST 10 DAYS AFTER THE TWO LEADERS COME TO TERMS, THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS. KENNEDY IS ASSASSINATED IN DALLAS. AND LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, KHRUSHCHEV IS REMOVED FROM OFFICE. WAS THIS A COINCIDENCE? OR WAS THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SOMEHOW TIED TO THE TWO LEADER'' SECRET AGREEMENT TO SHARE UFO INTELLIGENCE? DID SOMEONE OF SOMETHING ORCHESTRATE THEIR FALL FROM POWER? IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOW, THE TWO COMPETING SUPERPOWERS WILL FIND THEMSELVES THE TARGETS OF DANGEROUS ALIEN INTERFERENCE. BUT NOT IN SPACE. IN MARCH 1967, A UFO APPEARS OVER THE AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS FACILITY AT MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE IN MONTANA, RENDERING ITS WARHEADS INOPERABLE. IT'S THE FIRST IN A STRING OF INCIDENTS THAT SEE UFOs TARGETING NUCLEAR WEAPONS FACILITIES. ONE EVENT WILL PUSH THE WORLD TO THE BRINK OF ALL-OUT NUCLEAR WAR. UNSEALED CASE FILE: THE USOVO INCIDENT. USOVO, OCTOBER 4, 1982. WITNESSES REPORT STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY OVER THE NEARBY NUCLEAR MISSILE BASE. THEY DART BACK AND FORTH IN A SERIES OF DAZZLING MOVES. SUDDENLY, THE BASE CONTROL PANEL SPRINGS TO LIFE. IN A LATER DEPOSITION, MAJOR M. DAVIDOVICH KATAMAN WILL LATER STATE THAT HE "OBSERVED SPONTANEOUS ILLUMINATION OF ALL DISPLAYS." COMPLEX LAUNCH CODES ARE BEING ENTERED BY UNSEEN HANDS. THE MISSILES ARE PREPARING TO FIRE. FOR 15 HEART-STOPPING SECONDS, BASE PERSONNEL WATCH HELPLESSLY AS THE WORLD TEETERS ON THE BRINK OF ARMAGEDDON. BUT THEN, JUST AS SUDDENLY AS THE LAUNCH SEQUENCE BEGAN, THE SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN, AND THE LIGHTS OUTSIDE DISAPPEAR. THE INCIDENT RAISES PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION OF OUR TIME--WHY WOULD ALIEN BEINGS TOY WITH THE ULTIMATE WEAPON? ACCORDING TO REPORTS, IN 1982, UFOs TAMPERED WITH A SOVIET NUCLEAR FACILITY, PUSHING THE WORLD TO THE BRINK OF ARMAGEDDON. BUT THIS WASN'T THE FIRST INCIDENT OF ITS KIND. IN 1967, A UFO REPORTEDLY DISARMED AN ENTIRE MISSILE SILO AT MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE IN MONTANA. THE QUESTION IS, WHY WERE ALIENS TAMPERING WITH THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL NUCLEAR ARSENALS DURING THE COLD WAR? UFOLOGIST JOHN GREENWALD BELIEVES THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS. >> LET'S SAY EXTRATERRESTRIALS TRULY ARE APPEARING OVER OUR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY. IS THERE A MESSAGE TO THAT? BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THEM TRYING TO DISARM OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR TO INSTILL FEAR THAT OUR MILITARY TECHNOLOGY WILL PALE COMPARED TO WHAT THEY HAVE, I DON'T THINK THEY NEED TO DO THAT. {\an8}GREENWALD BELIEVES THAT IF ALIENS ARE HERE, THEY AREN'T {\an8}HERE TO TEACH US A LESSON OR OFFER EASY ANSWERS, BUT THAT {\an8}THEIR PRESENCE ALONE MIGHT FORCE US TO START QUESTIONING OUR {\an8}PETTY DIFFERENCES. AND IF ALIENS ARE MONITORING OUR PROGRESS, {\an8}IT COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEACEFUL CONTACT WITH {\an8}HUMANITY AND THE OBLITERATION... OF PLANET EARTH. {\an8}THIS IS "UNSEALED: ALIEN FILES." EXPOSING THE BIGGEST SECRET {\an8}ON PLANET EARTH. Corrected & sync CORNELDVD
