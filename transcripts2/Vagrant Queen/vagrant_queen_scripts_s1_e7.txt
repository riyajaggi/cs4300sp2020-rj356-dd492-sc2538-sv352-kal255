 Let me get this straight. You towed our ship? That does seem to be the case. And now you want us to pay for a train... The Sunshine Express. ...because it's the only way to the impound lot? - Unless you have a ship... - Which I don't have - because you towed our... - Oh... Gimme one ticket. That'll be 500 units. Have a Sunshine Express-ive day! - Hi! - Two tickets, please.

 Guessing a large part of the economy on this planet is scamming people into getting on this train? - You have to admire that. - Have a many suns shining day! All aboard the Sunshine Express! Tickets out. No ticket, and you get shot in the face. With sunshine! But seriously, please have your tickets or else I'll have to call security. You have every reason to leave. But it won't solve anything. You don't have to do any of this alone, El. Look, I know you just want to help, but... ...this is for the best. I'm glad you're taking Winni.

 - El, if we stay together... - All of this... ...was just a mistake. Goodbye. - I'm sorry. - I know, Isaac. Please take your seats. The ride of a lifetime is about to begin! - Seat's taken. - For your bag? Really? That's not very... Never mind. This is the sixth cart we've checked. You would think there would be guaranteed seats for the prices of these tickets. I thought the Xija shuttle was expensive, but this is just ridiculous! Sally, honey! I saved you a seat. - Thank you, but I'm with... - No one. No one but you. One of us might as well enjoy this damn journey. Catch you later. Hi. Thank you, I owe you one. Big time. Can I start making it up to you... with a drink? Greetings, sunshine. I'm here to take your order. - Alcohol. - We have many alcohol options. - Which type would... - Alcohol. Payment accepted. Have a sunshine-y day. Hurry, Eldaya! Mom, get in! Trust only yourself. Mom. No, Mom, Mom, no! Mom! Mom! Emergency evacuation system activated. Hello? No, no, hello, can someone hear me? Can you please help my mom? Please help my mom, please! Mom! This is transport ship Diplod, we received your distress call. Is everything okay, over? Are you in need of assistance? We received a distress call... Elida! It's Terex! Terex! We worked together once, on Galianox. You were scavving with another dude, - man, what's his name? Uh... - Not anymore. Well... fancy seeing you here! I got some good gigs coming up. Like this one I'm setting up today... I'm good, thanks. All right. Your loss. Oh, sorry. You should watch where you sit. Yeah, well... that is one of the many things that I need to do. Ugh. Please tell me they stop playing this tune at some point. It's so annoying. I'm sorry. Want one? So that was it. Had to take my pilot's course half-naked and covered in blagorian slime. - No! - Yes. But! I still passed, and get this. I got my first shipping gig two weeks later. Transporting blagorian slime. - You're lying. - I'm not. I had to spend the whole trip with my nose plugged trying not to throw up. So, aside from being my hero, you're smart, worldly, and a hilarious travel companion. Lucky me. I'm feeling pretty lucky at this moment too. Don't flarking screw me over now, Darryl. I ain't going to Arriopa. Their defences are insane. Hence, the nice compensation, asshat. Besides, haven't you heard the rumours? Republic is toast. Hey. Your job's in Arriopa? - Yeah. - I'm interested. 100,000 units, plus a ship. - Get to keep the ship? - Hell, yeah. Needs some TLC, and it's just - a one-seater bubble drifter. - Good. - I work alone, I'm in. - Yeah, well, that's my gig. Oh, now you want it, Darryl? Well, ya snooze, ya lose. - But would you... - Get. Lost. - The job? - Stripping parts. I need someone right now, if you get my drift. Contact's on route. Town's coming up. You can bail off the train. Coordinates to the ship. The guy will give you more info. You gon' finish that? No? All right. Here in Carillo, it's going to be hot, hot, hot! In Republic news, it sounds as if most of the Council have been executed for treason. And you thought your work day was bad. Who's this handsome devil? You'll get to meet Arriopa's dashing new leader - No... - conference later today but up- ...our favourite animal bloopers of the week! Not a fan of Arriopa's new leader? No. I'm a fan. I would just be a bigger fan if he was dead. All right. Just like we talked about. We keep things on the down-low. Target is here somewhere. Big payday, this one. Nice. What sort of business? Packing heat. What is that, Shredder 500? Enough to take the hair off your balls if you're not careful. I, uh, appreciate the offer, but... I already maintain a well-manicured garden. So, uh, what are you, on the run or something? You ask a lot of questions. Do I? So what brings you to the Sunshine Express? - Well... my ship was towed. - Ouch. - Yeah. - Not surprising. - That happens a lot here. - You live here? On Carillo? No. - Here once a week for work. - Oh. But there is this really great Metaxian bar at the next stop if you're hungry? You're asking me on a date? Yeah, I am. I'm sorry. I... I can't. I get it, Metaxian food can be pretty heavy. There is this Kafkarian place also... not as good, but... You are funny and lovely, and beautiful. But... I can't. - There's... - Someone else? Yeah. Maybe. But no, I... I don't know. It's... She left. But she's still here. I have to go. I'm sorry. Don't be. This was fun. Good luck. Grand Supreme Leader. Lazaro, Grand Supreme Leader. Guardian of the people. Where is my other stylist? I need this fixed before my announcement. Just outside, Grand Supreme Leader. This is your interpretation of suave? Honestly, where did you study? Aha, careful! Now, Rykal, I need you to really emphasize the gravitas of your failed leadership at our press conference today, yeah? Give it a go. Great people of Arriopa, we have failed you as a Republic. Ah, not feeling it. It is clear that the damage done by our poor leadership... - I am not feeling this! - ...can only be repaired... ...with the vision... - Yes? - ...and tenacity... - Yes? - ...of our newly appointed... Grand Supreme Leader... - Lazaro. - Not bad in places. - Again. - Gre... gre... great people of Arriopa... I am honoured to introduce our Grand Supreme Leader, Lazaro. Greetings, all citizens of the Republic Territories. I stand before you today... a revolutionary. I have always fought for your worlds. The monarchy was the old face of oppression. The Republic was the new. Each living in opulence while you toiled. The admirals didn't just hand over power to him. The Republic told you they would bring you prosperity... I say they fed themselves. The Republic told you they would empower you, but I see how they kept you down. Tyranny cast its shadow across our galaxy over and over, and I say no more! Oh, sorry, excuse me! Hey. How are we supposed to do this quietly... ...if they're wearing these damn bubble helmets. Shit. You're right. All right, Sunshine twits! This is a motherchucking robbery! Run! Hey, What's going on? They're searching for someone. They found me. Elida! Uh, I'm... I'm looking for an Elida. You just missed her, sunshine. I suppose I could tell you what I know about her. - Yes, please. - Nice comms device. I'm sorry. Tell them you're going to shoot me. Uh, what now? Don't move, or I'll... shoot her. Make it believable. Don't move or I'll shoot her! Look, we're not interested in you, just hand her over and we'll go. - Why do you want her? - Why do they want you? Come on, man, you know she's not worth anything dead. How about... we split the reward? - What reward? - The one on her head. Hang on a second. If you're not doing this to stop us from taking her... why are you doing this? Because, uh... this is a hostage situation, and I have demands! - Is he serious? - I don't... Okay. So what would it take for you to not shoot her? - Uh... - Stop the train. - Maple syrup! - What? And poutine. - What is that? - What are you doing? See, you wanna explain to me what is going on here? There's a bounty on my head. All Aszagerologists have been ordered to Arriopa, ...or they die. A sad geologist? Aszagerologist... The ancient study of the celestial powers. The history of the core of civilization, before it was overrun by idiots. And tickets to the Grey Cup! What is that? Arriopa. Wait... does this have something to do with the Sterzaad? How do you know about that? That... is a long story. Don't worry, I got friends on this train, and one of them can take out these goons in a second. Call Elida. Come on, El, answer. All good. Next option is just as badass. Call Amae. Yella? - Amae? - Wrong number. Don't call me again, asshat! You don't have any friends, do ya? Transport ship Diplod here. How's it going today? My day, you ask? Ah, it's been pretty good, can't complain. Twisted my arm earlier, so that's been bugging me. Wish I could say it was while doing a super cool backflip, but it was while I was reaching for crunchies on the top shelf. Ah, who knows. Perhaps there's no one on this line and I've been chatting to myself this whole time. I'd like to think you can hear me, stranger drifting. Have a good day. Hello? Well, hello, there. What's your name, stranger? El... - Elida. - Hello, Elida, I'm Stox. But you know that already. Nice to meet you. No way. I swear to you, I had a pet Galaphant. Thing wouldn't leave me alone. Damn near smashed the door frame crawling into my home. And have you heard those things snore before? It's like trying to sleep during a Wreckoor tornado! So, where are you from, Elida? Nowhere. Yeah, I get it. No reason to trust me. I'm nothing but a strange voice. Look, we picked up your distres signal a few weeks back, which means you're either on a vessel in need, or you're in a pod. Either way, I imagine your food supply is low. If you switch on your location systems, we'll help you in a heartbeat. We're here when you need us, okay, kiddo? No need to be alone. Over. I want my maple syrup! And my poutine! Man, we can't stay here all day. Security's gonna be here any minute, and we - gotta make this delivery. - And I don't even know who this Mable Sorrop is. Hey, get back. - Little busy here. - This is taking too long. Back off! Or I'll shoot her! Isaac? - Wait, you know him? - Yes. - No! - What's going on, Isaac? Shit! She's with me. Let the scientist go, or we kill her. Isaac. Do what they say. Let her go. Also, this is really not how you handle a hostage situation. Just let me speak to him. Amae, this isn't what it looks like. What do we do now? You look lost, stranger. Terex said you had a ship for me. Ah. You're the new scav, huh? - Need any weapons? - Always. The Republic separated us. - I will connect us. - Lazaro. Allow me to introduce my first act as your guardian. He seems all right, don't he? I hereby banish all borders. Ports open to all. The divide between Arriopa and other worlds ends today. I would like to invite the leaders of all the planets to join us in celebrating this new era. Let Arriopa host you for a trul unforgettable experience. Grand Supreme Leader. A photo for your coronation invites? Of course. Have my deliveries arrived? Some, but not all, sir. Hey, don't you hurt her! Help! - What? - Let her go or I'll do it. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. I am putting my gun away. Let her go. What is going on? God, this is taking too long. Nobody move or they'll get blasted with several million volts of laser-focused sunshine! They're hijacking the train. - What? - And they're selling sunblock. No, no, no, no! Everyone stay calm. There's... there's nothing to worry about. - I can't stay here. - This is still a happy day. Hey, where are you going? Ready? Three, two... One! Yeah. Ah, here you go. You good? Okay. Let's go. Pretty tight, but it's no problem for a loner like yourself. You got about two more hops before the regulator fries. It'll get you to Arriopa all right. It's got a radio, though. Newly appointed Grand Supreme Leader Lazaro is hosting a paaar-tay! Ha. You're Arriopian, ain't ya? Goin' home for the party? I'll be there all right. To finish this once... and for all. Anyway... uh, you just get those parts. We ain't dealin' with patient clients. - Starshine, come back! - Hmm. Carillo cops will be waiting for us at the other end of the line. I'm afraid we don't take kindly to those who try to disrupt the Sunshine Express experience. Now I'll have to fill in a report. And reports don't make me happy. And I want to... Trev. Side pocket. Three... two... one. Uh... let's go. - She's gone? - She took a job and bailed. I didn't think it was real. You know? You thought a train journey would change her mind? I just thought that once she had time to process, you know, that I could explain what happened and... It'll be a long time before she's ready for that. I should've fought harder. I should've talked to her. - Maybe if I just... - Are you kidding me? This is not your fault. We never deserved you. Are you two done wasting time? - We need to move. - I'm Amae, by the way. Lazaro has a bounty on her. Needs her to work the Sterzaad. No. He needs my knowledge to build the conduits required to unlock its full power. With this, he will be unstoppable. So the further I am from Arriopa, the better for everyone. So, we just hide you? Keep him weak enough to fight? Wrong again. There're at least a dozen Aszadterologists still around, myself included. Unfortunately, several of my colleagues have gone missing. And if he has them, well... he's probably already unstoppable. Well, there's still hope. Let's get you to our ship and somewhere safe. Where is your ship? It's on the other end of the line. We'll have to get there by foot. Well, obviously. Unless you can fly. You definitely had the better travel companion. You get her number, by the way? No. No. Destination set: Planet Arriopa. Sounds simple enough. As long as we stay away from him, he can't go all Jedi mind control on us, right? His range is limited now, but the Sterzaad is capable of so much more. So how does that work? How can Lazaro use it if he's not of royal blood? Only royal blood can activate it, but once active, it can be used by anybody that has the right technology. The Sterzaad is an immense source of power, maybe the most powerful the universe has ever known. But it needs the right conduit to channel its powers. - He has one of those. - Hath's necklace. And he'll want more to harness its full potential. This ancient tech is extremely rare, but... it can be built again, if you know how it works. And you do? Pretty clear you're not gonna shoot her. So, how about we just shoot you? One second. Yeah, no, we hate that idea! Run! Okay... Remember, stun her, drop the other two. Whoa. Wait, wait. Is this still worth it? Unless you wanna live in your parents' basement for another five years, I'd say yeah! Yeah, it's worth it. - That doesn't look good. - That's a Republic ship. Oh, finally. Backup is here. Great, right? Their latest stuff sucked, but the first album is what it's all about. How you doin', kiddo? I've run out of supplies. I got enough food here to feed an army of Galaphants. Or you by the sound of it. Don't kill yourself, kiddo. What's your location? - Bring extra crunchies. - You got it, kiddo. I see your signal. Looks like you're in the Klor district. We're narrowing in on you now. Trust only yourself. Oh. We lost you there, kiddo. I... I can't. Sure you can. You'll die. I know. We'll help you, just tell us where you are, Eldaya. I never told you my name. Look, you'll die in there soon. Tell us where you are. Tell us where you... We lost her. Pull yourself together, Elida. Pull yourself together, Elida. We Are now entering Arriopan space About time. She's, uh, she's right over there. So, uh, how about you just pay up now and, uh, take over. Sounds like we're doing all the heavy lifting. - Deal's off. - Like hell it is. - You wanna join him? - No... no. Find the scientist. Kill the others. Even with a full charge, we can't take on this many of them. Throw away your guns, both of you. Hold on. Doesn't mean we need to go down that easily?! Trust me. Throw them away. Now. This'll be easier than I thought. I'd block your ears. It's about to get messy. I, uh, don't have much cash on me, but would you be open to a creative trade for that thing? They're unarmed! We can finish them now! Ahhh! I told you I had friends! Ahhh! Isaac! - No! - No, Isaac, run! I'll distract them. You run as fast as you can. - And you don't look back, okay? - No, Isaac? Run. Ahhh! Isaac! That's for Trev! Thank you. We should go... before she changes her mind. If Elida was here, the scientist would be fine. Would've saved her. Let's go get him. That asshole. Anywhere else you gotta be? We're an engine, right? Wasn't that your metaphor? - Spark cable? - Plug. Right. But I mean... let's take down Lazaro together. You, me. I wish that she was here too. She's an important spark cable. - Plug. - Dammit! I think... I think that spark plug became something more to me, Isaac. More than just the device to fire the explosive mixture into the combustion engine, you know? More like... the turbo charger, like... Yeah. I got it. Let's go get our ship back. I'm so happy you could join us. I trust you're enjoying your stay? Do you know who I am? You're an arrogant, entitled imbecile, who's not nearly as special as he thinks he is. - Hmm. - History is littered with fools like you, and none of them are missed. You know, you're being offered an incredible opportunity here. You will have the best facility in the galaxy. Access to the most advanced equipment. I'd rather die. Hmm. You know I relish... these little moments of resistance. 'Cause I know that soon, they'll be just a distant memory. You will reveal to me the powers of the Sterzaad. Yes. All my knowledge is yours. All will be revealed. Sure. I'd be happy to get that for you, after you pay your fines. Let me just pull it up on the system here. And... ...ah. Huh. It seems like your ship isn't actually here. What do you mean it isn't here? Well, it's showing up on our system here with all these fines, but it isn't physically here. Where is it? Ah... Ooh. It appears your ship has been misplaced. - What? - How do you misplace a ship? It happens sometimes. Fill out this claim form, we'll put out a system-wide request. It shouldn't take longer than a couple of weeks. What... what are we supposed to do now? There's a Preyhound shuttle stop just a short walk away. Ugh. I'm done with public transport. Uh, look, I... I understand you're upset. Could you please step aside, though? We have a dedicated sadness area over by the smokers' corner. Thank you. Have a many sunshining day? Short walk, my ass. This is all my fault. - There it is. - Yeah... - It was cathartic, I guess. - No, Isaac, over there! Winnie! Thought I'd catch you on the way to the shuttle. Sorry, I woulda picked you up earlier, but I didn't exactly ask when I took Winni back. - Nice. - Hi. Rough day? Listen, um... being alone used to feel normal and safe. And now it doesn't. Not being alone would feel less... sucky. Even when the people you're with sometimes do sucky things. In my head, that was way more articulate than... Being vulnerable isn't a weakness. It's a strength. Everything isn't cool, but... I'm not going anywhere. And neither are you. We're going after him, El. We're going to Arriopa. I know. I guess what I meant was, um, may I join you on the ship? - It's your ship, buddy. - OUR ship. So... we should probably get off this planet before they impound us again. I really don't think we need to worry about these sunshine morons. Wow. Just wow. What an honour to meet agents of the Intergalactic Parking Authority. What you do is... inspiring. All in the line of duty. What can you tell us about this particular case? Hoo-ee! I've never seen so many parking violations before. This one has quite the history. Sickening. We only bring this out for serious cases. They're not going anywhere. ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪
