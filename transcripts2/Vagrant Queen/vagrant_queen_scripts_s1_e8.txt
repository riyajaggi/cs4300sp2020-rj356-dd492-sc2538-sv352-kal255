 This can't be right. Elida said Earth puppies were cute-‐ Oh, no. The day before the big event and Arriopa is already buzzing. Early visitors are camping outside the grounds hoping to secure prime spots for the event everyone is talking about. Pssh. Everyone. We're only talking about it because we're planning to take down the host. Oh, another great map, by the way.

 Thank you. It's missing a few details, but it's all I can remember about the palace. With Lazaro's promise of sharing Arriopan wealth, planet leaders have been eager to take the trek to this once royal planet. But for general admittance, however, tickets are... - We should just turn it off. ...- sold out. That's right, tickets to the palace grounds are sold... Is there another headliner? Tickets are the least of our worries. Yeah, we'll just mug someone. Wow. Been spending too much time with you guys. Ooh, nice!

 The Vraut we got for that scav job on Kyn Zeta. You take payments in booze? Only when it's the good stuff. Wait. We have some seriously heavy planning to do. Yeah, exactly. This is our last night before we attempt the insane. I say we make the most of this night. To murdering Lazaro. Okay, but... we plan while we drink. Yeah. Yes! Yes, I love that! Or how about... this room? With a machete? - Whoa! - Decapitation. - Ohh! - Nice. A mounted Lazaro head. It would work so well for our Feng Shui. - Yeah. - I couldn't think of a better team to plan a murder with. Aw. This can't be our last meal. ♪ I said, shake, rattle and roll ♪ ♪ I said, shake, rattle and roll ♪ And there. WE are going all out. Did you just order Kracho curry? - Yeah. - Dude... that's my favourite! Aw, you know it. Oh... I love you guys. And my Winni! - Team Winni! - Team Winni! I...I, uh, wanted to talk to you guys about something. Uh... - Winni? - There seems to be a system power freeze activated remotely. I cannot override it. Power... freeze? That can't be. We have a doorbell? Just something I've been playing with. More importantly... ...who is it? - Drop it. - Our ship, our rules. Who the hell are you? - You invited us, dear. - Come again? When you didn't pay your fines. We're with the Intergalactic Parking Authority and have your ship in lockdown. This is a Forced Retrieval program to collect your exorbitant outstanding debt. Oh, crackers. ♪ Hey ♪ Playing a game, were we? - A party, more like. - Let's make this quick, got two more impounds before the shift is over. Am I right in thinking one of you owns this ship? - No. - No, you don't own this ship? - Yes. - So you do own the ship? - No. - Yes. There's still confusion as to who owns this ship? - She does. - You do? - I told you I don't. - Give us a clear answer! - What was the question? - Who owns the bloody ship?! I do! And there's no need to shout. - I'm not shouting! - We're impounding your ship so you'll all be heading down to our headquarters... Mm, we're not going anywhere. Oops. 'Scuse me. - What's wrong with this guy? - Lloyd has the flu. And you brought him onto our ship? It's okay. I... I'll be better soon. Everybody off. Now. Whoa, you put 'em down, punks. Oh, please, dear. If I had a unit for every time a ticket evader pulled a gun on me... Wait! We took your guns. Where did you get those ones? No shortage here. Look, what if we just paid up now in full? Certainly. - Here's the amount. - Okay. Oh... my... I'll go get the unit reader. Uh... Guys, perhaps you could get our guests some snacks. No time for that. Let's just... Uh-uh. I could use a snack, actually. Me too. I am famished. We've been working split shifts the whole week. That's true. Okay, fine. But leave your guns. Fine. Snacks, coming up. So, uh, what do you reckon? Too late for a Stun 'n Run? Yeah, probably a straight Kill 'n Run now. But give Amae a chance. If anybody can fix it, she can. That's true. But there's no way she'd be okay with a bunch of murders on our Winni. Mm, too much to clean. No, but seriously. Have you ever seen the ship look this good? Things are... definitely better with her around. You gonna keep ignoring it? - Ignore what? - Come on. You. And Amae. Mm-mm, it's not like that. It's not. Look, Amae gets on with everyone. We're just friends. I don't know if she sees it like that. I...I like... how things are right now. And... I can't lose this again. Mm, pass me a bowl. Human in space, zero hand-eye coordination - with a little bit of booze. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, El. For everything. Yeah, me too. That, um... stuff I said back on Wix about your family. I didn't mean it. Cool? That looks like monkey brains. Why is he at work? Oh, the company doesn't pay for sick days, so... I must warn you all that with the increased oxygen production demands, the power reserves are being affected. We're wasting time. Eat up, then we're leaving. I've told Kahn to prepare for the departure. Is this soup all you have? Dude! If you don't get the hell off my ship, I'm gonna eject you from the airlock. Poor baby. He caught it on holiday in Kafkaria, didn't ya, honey? Oh, my gosh. Well, I tell you what. That's off my bucket list. I've seen so many places, you can ask me about any of them. I'm like an open book. I'll unpack pretty much anything... Ugh, are you afraid of silence? So... where were you all headin'? - Nowhere. - Well, since we're controlling your ship, let's have a look. Looks like you're charging for a hop to Arriopa. You're going to the party? Me too. They... they sold out, don't you know? But I... I know people. I've even got me a spare ticket. Thanks, but, uh, I'm married. - Oh... - No. - Not them. - Oh. No, she's in a different galaxy. It's a long story. This one is just unfair. Parking on an octuple line in a septuple crossing? Sounds pretty simple to me. Seven lines here. Eight lines here. Park here, don't park here! You know, I was annoyed with them. Sure, they make dumb decisions, like accepting payments in booze... Which you cannot pay your parking tickets with! But now I understand. The Parking Authority are just a bunch of criminals in matching suits! Okay, break time's over. Let's go. Whoever that is, that is my leg. It's the power reserves. Winni! Boosting power now. - Who shot him? - Someone took my gun. - Oh, likely story. - It was you. Or one of you. - Excuse me, why us? - 'Cause you have motive. - What motive? - You owe us money you can't pay. Still, it isn't us. Absolutely no way I'd make this mess on my ship. Do you have any idea how difficult it will be to get that stain out of the carpet? And you all have guns, so we don't need Columbo to narrow it down for us. You've already showed us that you have guns planted everywhere! Pfft. Whatever... And our guns can't do THAT. Really? What are you packing? 'Cause our smallest fusion snipers can do - double that damage. - Not helping our case. I said double. Obviously it's not one of our guns. You are criminals evading the law! Calm down. It's evading parking tickets. Big a-difference. It's a gateway crime to murder! If I was a murderer, you'd all be dead. Just maybe stop talking. I said if. Someone's gun went off and it wasn't mine. The shot hit here. Whoever did that can repair it! So, if the shot that went off hit the wall, then... ...then who killed Lloyd? And how? Or to find the killer, the question we must ask is... who. Has. Motive? - You do. - Not me. You! What are you doing, Eileen? I heard you arguing with Lloyd the other day. You threatened to kill him in public. Well, why would you threaten to kill him in public? I think she meant he threatened in public to kill him. He was eating my lunch out of the fridge every day for a year. I finally caught him in the act. Hardly motive. Depends, what was the lunch? Oh, you wanna go, Eileen? What about you? You and Lloyd were up for the same promotion. He got it. YOU hated him for it. - Interesting. - No, it's not. - It's a vicious lie! - Lesley? You've been awfully quiet about this whole ordeal. I didn't really know him, so... You shared an office. Yeah, well... Maybe he was poisoned! Can everyone stop messing up our ship?! It is whiskey, not poison. And what poison can do that? Look, it sounds like a lot of group therapy sessions for you all. Time to pack up and get the hell off our ship. Winnibee, what's going on? Who else is in here? - Just me. - So who just screamed? Why am I screaming through your speakers? It is the recording Isaac asked me to capture. It's always smart to record your conversations with authorities. I am a lawyer. I was saving the file when the error occurred. I cannot charge. My systems are failing. Sorry, Winni. Did you see anything during the blackout? Negative. I am running in low power mode. I'm afraid I do not know which one of you is the killer. Who else is on the ship? Just Kahn. Kahn! I didn't do it. - This is a ship of death! - A bit dramatic. - We should call the Admiralty. - No! They do not play fair. I had a run-in with them not long ago. - Let me guess, for murder? - Why don't you wanna call them? I really just think we're making great progress on our own. No, we're not. We have no idea who is killing off our agents. Clearly one of you, because trust me, I know how to kill, and I would've taken you all out at once. - Still not helping. - Point is, it wouldn't have been drawn out like this, because THIS is a waste of time. It seems to me like you guys got far bigger problems on your hands than our parking tickets. We'll help you load these bodies onto your ship and you can all head back to... Our ship is gone! Well, shit. What is it? What's the holdup? Your buddy's gone. What? How does a headless body disappear? - What did you do with him? - What, when we were all downstairs dragging this one up here? - Maybe your robot did it. - Hey! Leave Winni out of this! Maybe he wasn't dead. He looked a few levels past dead to me. - I need a drink. - Maybe now's not the best time to be drinking. I just lost two friends. You said you didn't know Lloyd? I didn't say that they were good friends. There's more in the supply closet, why dont you grab me some? We really don't have time for this. I'm sorry. Are the deaths of our agents putting your party plans on hold? - Yeah. - You're putting on hold something a lot bigger than a party. A fate-of-the-galaxy type of deal. We really weren't expecting another sidebar adventure. Come on! He's dead. Again. - Who would kill him twice? - That is definitely overkill. We are taking this ship back to our headquarters right now! The ship's power reserves are now - at a dangerous level. - We're going to die! Please, I'm desperate to get off! Now is not the time to be gettin' off. How can you make jokes at a time like this? Yeah, it's a coping mechanism. Kahn has the controller for the ship. I don't want to... It's not here. Maybe it's something I can override? What system protocols are you guys using? The controller and the receiver are hard-coded with a unique encryption key. So unless you have an identical controller, which you don't, because it doesn't exist, then we're out of luck. We have a tracker on the controller. - It's on this ship! - Great! Where? Wow, that's not really accurate, is it? You should update your galaxy position system. - Hell no! - Maybe they'll just go away? Hey, Gluuber Eats. - Someone ordered a curry? - Yep, thanks. I...I really need to use your washroom, man, please. I threw in an extra frankenfurter for you. One moment. Of course. Right this way. - Okay, where is it? - What, the body? - The washroom? What body? - No body. There is no body in the washroom. You're free to use it. He will call the Admiralty on us. And we will all be thrown in jail! Please! Don't you think we should get that man off of this ship before he finds out what's going on?! There are two dead bodies in the main room! Shhh! I had to stop him from screaming. We need to find this damn device. We should split up, search the ship in twos. That's a terrible idea. What if one of us is left with the murderer? Well, at least then we'll know who the murderer is. We'll all be dead once the reserves are gone, - so you got a better idea? - Who goes with who? Ho... We'll draw for partners. The shortest two together, and then the next two, and so on. - Agreed? - Mm-hmm. Wait. Three of us have the same size frankenfurter. No, yours matches this one. You can search the cockpit with Winnibot. Oh... it's you and me, honey-bunch. Two teams down here, two teams upstairs. Wait. This device, what's it look like? About this big, black, big red button. Okay. You cheated, didn't you? I mean... I wasn't gonna get stuck with one of those deranged lunatics. And besides, Isaac is completely useless at finding things. Earlier on, before the agents showed up, you wanted to talk to me and Isaac about something. Oh, yeah. It was nothing. Can you believe this is happening? I mean, comparative to what's happened the last few weeks, I feel like this is the next logical step. I wouldn't change any of it. Crackers, that came out wrong! I would change Lazaro getting away with the Sterzaad, and your mom not being on Wix, - and half dying, and... - It's okay. I know what you mean. You do? Totally! It's great having a full-time mechanic on board, and now I don't just have Isaac for company. ...Right. Terrible timing, this whole ordeal. I'm quitting, you know. Next month, when bonuses come out. Going back to being a singing telegram. Less stressful. I'm not paid enough to die. None of us are. You know, this... This ship is the worst, junkiest piece of shit I have ever... You wanna go in front of me? Absolutely not. You seem stressed. Perhaps I can play some music to calm you. ♪ Hey nonny ding dong... ♪ [loud thunder rumbling] ♪ Boom ba-doh, ba-doo, ba-doodle-ay ♪ ♪ Oh, life could be a dream ♪ ♪ If I could take you up in paradise up above ♪ Should we go together? Okay. Aw, shit, man. Come on... Well, there goes my five-star ratin'. So, what's the deal? Travellin' alone with two women, neither of which is your wife? - That's a long story. - Oh... We've got time, sugar. My wife is on a distant planet. I have been trying to get back to her. - Well, was trying. - Oh. Not anymore? Troubles at home? No, it is an impossible planet to find. Well, what is it called? - You never heard of it. - Well, I bet I have. - I've travelled a lot. - I promise you haven't. - I bet I have, try me. - Fine. Earth. Never heard of it. Just checking. - Everything okay? - Yep, two bodies. Everything... is fine. Ah! - Oh! - Ooh. I can't take any more scares. ♪ ... lovin' you ♪ - ♪ Life could be... be... be ♪ - [she screams] I am sorry. My systems are failing. Let us in, let us in! Let us out, let us out! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We're not blowing another hole in Winni. I can break it down with my body. - Do it! - Or... Ugh. Getting serious now. Two deaths were serious enough. - How'd you get in there? - Secret passageway. We have a secret passageway? Always a new surprise, Winni. Why do you have a secret passageway leading to the washroom? That's gross. The ship was Isaac's originally. - I didn't do it! - Secret passageway. That's it. There's a passageway that runs from the palace garden statues into the basement. - That's how we get in. - Oh, what's that? It's a game. This is hardly a time for games! Hey. Hey, who are you calling? - I'm alerting the Admiralty. - No! Are you mad?! That was our last chance at survival. Now we have nothing. Nothing! If there's anybody here, just... ...look out. Three people have been murdered. - Very aware of that. - And it's messing up my ship. Is there anything we can do without this missing device? If we had more time, I could wipe and re-install our entire system. - How much time? - A day? Or two? Okay. - We continue the search. - I'm staying put. I don't trust any of you. Current life reserves will run out in 15 minutes. - So load up, peacock. - Guys. Where's Mull? Hole in the head. Same as the driver and Kahn. If this is the killer's signature, why was Lloyd's head blown off? Maybe he was practice! While the killer developed his pattern. Or her pattern. I'm getting really bored of this game. Which one of you did it? Tell me now, - or I kill all three of you. - She will. If it's not already obvious, I am just as bored of this dinner party. Why would I call the Admiralty if it was me? - Blood makes me squeamish. - You were paired with Mull. Maybe he annoyed you. He WAS an asshole. And we did find you in the washroom with the driver. - Maybe you both did it! - I. Didn't. Do it! Then who the hell did?! - You guys saw that, right? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Great. Looks like someone... ...let a damn space bug in! - Is that the killer? - I hope so. Monsters we can handle. Okay, new plan. Two groups continue to search for the device, and we'll go monster-hunting. We all need more weapons if we're going to be trapped here with that thing! Yes! Piece of pipe? Ooh! I want this one. This should be in my work station. I always wondered what this was. And this? That's rope, Isaac. Oof! Godforsaken ship! If we're going down, I am going all out. So... this planet, Earth, they all look like you? Well, I mean, I am one of the more advanced of the spe... Species, but, uh, but yeah. I must visit. To... tough to get to, you say? I didn't say it was tough. I said impossible. As in different galaxy, as in Milky Way. Or as you call it, Scadbury. Oh, ohh! The... The Scadbury galaxy. Oh, yeah, I love it there! Hey, um... there WAS something I wanted to talk to you guys about. When we get to Arriopa... I'm going to the palace alone. What? How many times do we need to go over this? We're a team, we stay together. It's not like that. Look, I'm the only one who has any chance of taking on the Sterzaad. You don't know for sure if you're immune to it? No. But I know for sure you're not. Or Isaac. I can't believe it. Poor Kahn. She was a good parking agent. Such an optimist. Her death must've come as a great shock to her. Less talking, more... - Mind the ship. - I never miss. Technically I didn't miss? You've been to the Milky Way? Milky Way! That's so funny. Is that what you call it? - Sounds yummy. - When? Wow. Decades, in fact, since I was last there. Yeah? How did you get there? Gosh, well, if I remember correctly... No! You've got blood on your hands. Aren't you supposed to be dead? Uh... guys? Elida? Amae? Suddenly things got a lot more confusing. - Who's that? - Kahn. - She's alive? - Uh... no? Don't touch that, she shot Lesley. - What? She's the murderer? - No. But I know who is. Me too. And in order to help you understand, I shall have to take you through the events of the evening step-by-step. - At the start of the eveni... - Lloyd hatched. That's not where I was going. He just got back from a trip, right? Winni, deadly species on Kafkaria. The Corpal Seps. After laying eggs in living organisms, it can tak over motor control of its host. You people go there on holiday? It's like another Australia. - Lloyd was infected. - What, the flu he had? Not flu. The Corpal Seps was ready to hatch, pushing through his sinuses. The female of the species is more deadly than the male, and judging by how quickly it's grown, that's what we're dealing with. But here's what really happened. - No, that explained everything. - Nothing's explained. We still don't understand why Kahn is alive... again. She's not. The egg implanted in her has now taken over her motor controls. It's not Kahn. Oh, so that means... They're all starting to wake up. I should've stopped drinking a few murders back. Where are you going? Gluuber driver left his shuttle here. It's a one-seater. I'm sorry. I...I wouldn't do that! - No shooting the ship. - Shall we? The skulls are protected! Then what do we do?! ♪ Rattle those pots and pans ♪ ♪ Get out from that kitchen Rattle those pots and pans ♪ ♪ Well, roll my breakfast 'Cause I'm a hungry man ♪ Ah! ♪ I said, shake, rattle and roll ♪ ♪ I said, shake, rattle and roll ♪ ♪ Well, you never done nothing to save your doggone soul ♪ ♪ Shake, rattle & roll ♪ Are you hiding? I'm coming! Oh, you'll make an excellent host. Stab them through the mouth! Ahhh!!! One more to take down. Winnibee? Winni... - We stay together. - Damn right. No point in hiding anymore! Oh, I'm not hiding. Just playing. Holy shit. I must thank you. My first outing after hatching, and I couldn't have asked for a better evening. - I bet Lloyd could have. - Oh, it's a matter of life... ...after death. Now that he's dead, I have a life. No need to rush this anymore. You're all that's left. Hi, beautiful. I think I'll save you for last. What a great-sized head you have! Wait! There's still one thing I don't understand. - One thing? - Why'd you move Lloyd's body? I needed to feast in order to grow. A gruesome aftermath, I know. I tried to hide him, but... where were we? Flames... Flames on the side of my face? Heating? Let's get this bitch. We're losing oxygen. You mean to tell me... this whole time... we were just dealing with a damn parasite? Murder was just a red herring. Elida! Maybe... death by spider would've been better. Goddamn Parking Authority. Wait. You hear that? Please... - Oh... Keep going. - So gross. Elida. Oh. Holy shit. It is wise to dispose of all the bodies now. Good idea, Winnibee. - Goodbye, Lloyd. - Goodbye, Kahn. - Goodbye, Eileen. - Goodbye, McKean. - Goodbye, Lesley. - Goodbye... Mull? Goodbye... ...Never got his name. Mr. Body? And... voila. No more Parking Authority. Also... ...thank you, Lesley. Palace tickets? Nice. She'd, uh, been to my galaxy, you know. - Really? - Who knows? I never got to find out more. We'll find it. One day. Guys!!! It's a transmission from Captain Volun. It came in hours ago. Your Majesty... I have no idea whether this will reach you, but I had to try. General Dessai believes the best way to win the war against Lazaro is with excessive force. - Well, duh. - She's sending our battalion to Arriopa. She's going to bomb the city.
