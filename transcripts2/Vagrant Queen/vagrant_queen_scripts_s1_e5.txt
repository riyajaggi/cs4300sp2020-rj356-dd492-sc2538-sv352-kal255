 Ow. Owie. I told you, Elida, an ejector seat... was a stupid buy for a frickin' spaceship! Elida? Amae! Heh. Could be worse. Ow... Ahhh! ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey Ah! Ahhh!

 Holy shit. That reeks. "Don't be a lawyer," my dad said. "Why do you wanna work in a boring office? Where's the adventure in that?" Well, check. It. Out. Wow. It's beautiful, babe. Damn. I lost you again. - Oh, my God. - Anna, babe. I'm frozen in a freakishly weird position and you're taking a screen capture, aren't you? - I would never. - You hear that, baby? Your dad thinks he's so funny. But, he forgets all of those photos I took of his drunk ass at his last birthday party.

 You are teaching our child how to blackmail already. - God, I miss you. - I know what else you miss. So mean! That's way too far. We miss you too, babe. Just one more week. - How's the deal going? - Eh, there's some push backs on some terms, but that's why I'm here. - This is the last time, right? - Yeah. No more solo trips when Jackson arrives. - No. - Rachel? - Nope. - Copy that. Sorry. Mr. Stelling, message from dispatch. - Your meeting's been delayed. - Yeah. I am not gettin' rescheduled again. I know someone who's gonna be really pissed if I'm late home. - That's an understatement. - Sorry, sir. Foreman"s orders. Uh, winds have picked up to unusually high speeds over the Red Spot. But, hey, no bother. We'll just continue your tour. They are overly cautious here, it is incredibly annoying. Anna? Babe? You're breaking up. I'm gonna call you back, but I love you and Gertrude so much. - Definitely not. - Gertie for short, eh? We love you, bye... Amae? Amae... Amae, are you okay? I... Oh. Feels like someone is sledge-hammering my brain, but... oh, I'm okay. The others? Everyone is here except Isaac. His stupid ejector seat threw him further away. Dengar's out searching for him now. - Okay. - In the meantime, I could use your steady hand and a first aid kit. Okay. Hurry. Ready? We're gonna pull it out. Hold him still. In five, four... He did well. Let that settle for a moment, he'll be able to put weight on it soon. In the meantime, let's prep our supplies. The rest of the journey will have to be on foot. Sure, you look all cute now. And then your face is gonna open up, revealing a million sharp frickin' teeth! Or, you're gonna vomit up some gross green turd that will just explode on me. So, which one is it? Huh? Come on, then! Do you wanna join your friend? - You slimy, ugly piece of... - It's a dunkrum. That's pretty much all it does. - Where are the others? - They're okay. Krob needed a patch-up. Looks like you do, too. Not enough to slow Isaac Stelling down. - Let's hit it. - Oh. Oh, and over there, uh, that's where we keep the compressed fuel rods. Transporting those guys, they'redelayed until the storm's over. Oh, sir, we only have one rule over here, remember? - Helmets on at all times. - Yeah, I got it. But no fear, you're safe in here. These atmospheric runabouts, they're engineered to handle anything. Called this one Boofa. It's a really funny story. Ugh, we can't send messages now? - What the...? - What? Don't worry, I'm pretty sure it's nothing, sir. Our lines of communication are down with, uh, the main base. I'll get in touch with them on the old radio over here. That's, uh, Runabout 33 to base camp, over. Runabout 33 to base camp... - Oh! - Oh, shit. What was that?-Came from the storage facility. - Put your damn helmet on! - What's going on? Such extreme measures you will take to get outta carrying gear. - Hey... - Amae's handiwork. What's next? Hath said they're holding my mom in the sovereign tomb. It's gonna take most of the day for us to get there. What is that, like, a prison-slash-Temple of Doom? Come on. We watched that one on movie night. - Indy! - Nice. See, what I don't get is how he could escape snakes, but not carbonite? Okay, we havetalked about this so many times. Actors, they... Anyway... this ancient royal tomb place, what is it exactly? It was built by my ancestors millennia ago. Hath said the Republic decided to hold my mom there for some twisted retribution. Hey. What are you, having second thoughts? - Pssh. - You can stay back with the Winni and rest up if you want. What, are you kidding? You need my heroics. If we had to crash, it could've been a little bit closer. I guess it could've been worse. Optimism? Who are you? And what have you done with Elida? We're on the final stretch. Hey, I, um... I never got tothank you for coming to find me, and then helping me get here, and... You're welcome. And if you're coming, I'm not carrying your shit. The Druboscian vines remain a low level threat, assuming their roots are in no way disturbed. Stay away from the Clabvrok, their venom is highly neurotoxic. The carnivorous Vermis Harenae are found... - So basically avoid everything? - Unless you have an exoskeleton, which none of you do, then yes. - You gonna be okay, Winnibee? - Yes. By my interpretation around the parameters of okay, meaning satisfactory, not good.-Aw. I'll miss you too. I offered Isaac an out. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't offer you one too. Phew. I didn't know how to tell you, but... I can't do this. Oh. Okay. One of us falls, we all fall. Besides, moms love me. Just... just so I... I've got this straight, Lazaro failed to capture the queen in close range twice, ignored orders to return multiple times, damaged a border port, pissed off Xija station, and has now gone rogue? It would appear that way, ma'am. Well, he was your hire. Uh, well, he led the revolution. - You think you know a guy... - Enough! His title has been revoked. We currently have an outlaw commandeering one of our ships. Send an army. He either comes here in chains... or dead. So... Hath... I was thinking, you know, depending on the amount of security around the perimeter, we should send a team in from behind. We'll assessthe situation when we get there. We have no intel of what awaits us at the tomb. Look, whoever told you my mom was here had to have some kind of intel or something, right? I'm afraid not, Elida. But, rest assured. When we're closer, we'll make a plan together. We"re entering Druboscian vine territory, stay alert. Oh, how's the eye? Meh. You should've seen the other guy. I hope I do. There's not many people I fantasize about shooting, but Lazaro is high on that list. Oh, nine o'clock! The other clock! - Oh. - I'm pretty sure I saw those in Winnibot's presentation. Pst! - We should run, right? - We can't outrun them. - Oh, my God. - Just keep it slow. Stop moving, you little shit! What he means is, we don't want you to get eaten, friend. Shh. Wow. Smart little guy. Maybe... don'! - Oh, my! - Okay, I vote we try to outrun them. Now! Ah! - Amae! - Ahhh! We should be out of their range now. - Thank you, Isaac. - Any time. Let's not do that again. - That's the last of it. - No more wrestling plants. Got it. Hey. Show-off. I've been in worse spots. Good job. Hello? Anyone? Come in! Ah! Help... - How you holdin' up? - At this point? I'd feel anxious if I went through the day and something wasn't trying to eat me. One moment, Your Majesty. I can't believe... No. No, no. Why? Hath? Hey. Hath. What's going on? Are we here? The whole facility is underground. It is now. It was built millennia ago. I've never seen it with my own eyes before. Where are all the guards? There aren't any. I'm confused. Well, where's my mom, Hath? She's not here, Elida. She's never been here. Whoa, hold on. What the hell did you just say? Yeah, what... what he said. I don't... I don't... What? We needed you here... to claim something that only you can claim. The Sterzaad. - What? - Elida, the Sterzaad is more powerful than you can ever imagine. With it, peace can be restored throughout the galaxy. It's why we trained you so hard. All of it. All of it was to get you here. My mother... She's dead? But now, she can be avenged. Eight years ago, our colony was attacked before we could tell you our plan. It took years to rebuild and wenever stopped searching for you. I wanted to find you. Tell you everything, tell you that with this weapon, you can take down those responsible, those who forced you into this life on the run. Believe me, Elida, with this power... you can make them pay. Did you...? Whoa, No, I had no idea. - He told me she would be here. - Isaac is innocent. There are very few people who know about the Sterzaad, and even less who know of its location. - My own men didn't even know. - But why didn't you tell me?! At Kestallan, at the border, anywhere? I wanted to, more than anything. When I saw you again after all these years, it was clear that our objectives were not aligned. You had renounced your own monarchy. I thought if... if I could just get you here... that you would do the right thing and claim the Sterzaad as its rightful owner. It's what your mother would've wanted. No! You do not get to play that card, Hath. You're a liar! This dramatic speech right here, it's nothing but a ruse to hide the fact that you're just a... an asshole! And I'm not sorry I said that. Hate me, Elida! I deserve it. But this power is too important to give up! Billions of lives. If you don't... If you ever try to find me again... I will kill you. Without hesitation. You mean nothing to me. Stay. Back. Hey. Let me have this one? I'm sorry your leader is such a loser! I was really hoping to meet the woman that spawned you. I can't imagine what I would do if it were me, El. If I thought I was going home again, and some old man with terrible fashion sense was just lying to me? You know what the ironic part is? It was my motherwho told me not to trust anyone. Guess she meant Hath too. And she isright. Everyone is just looking out fornumber one, so you do the same. If that thing in there can really do what they say, no one can ever do shit to you again. All we can do is the best with what we're given. The rest? You just figure it out along the way. Whatever you wanna do, we're with you. Even if it's feeding Hath to one of those sandworms. If Amae hasn't done it already. Isaac Stelling? So, this Earth you speak of? - You found it? - We did. How far away is it? Where in the Milky Way - are we right now? - Yeah, that's the thing. Uh, this Milky Way? Well... we believe that's what we call the Scadbury galaxy. I like Milky Way, though. Sounds yummy, right? Anyway, it's a galaxy out. Wait. I'm in another... galaxy? Dude, like, three million lightyears away. - Wait, how... how do I get back? - You can't. We haven't had intergalactic travel for, like... 20 years. Ever since the Narrows War destroyed the centre of our galaxy. I don't understand. I'm here, though. - Yeah. - I got here. - Uh-huh. - So, how can I not get back? I know! Crazy, right? We literally cannot figure that out. It's like your wormhole sucked you into the intergalactic tunnel between our galaxies and spat you out right here, totally random. Like, one in a billion chance of that happening, how awesome is that? Or, you know, totally sucky. Ha ha... Uh, look, man, our ship only manages a few hops at a time, but... if you were to get your hands on one of those high-end ships, - maybe there's a way. - How do I get one of those? A lotta cash. Like, a lot. We'd offer you a job here, but it's minimum wage. And if you don't plan on taking advantage of the retirement benefits, there really is no point. Okay, man. Make yourself at home. Cool, cool. I don't know what the plan is yet. I don't know what I'll do when I get it. Hey... It's okay. You have time. And us. - Show me the way. - Thank you, Elida. - You're doing the right... - Don't! Okay? We're done. As soon as the Sterzaad is activated, the tomb will start to crumble. We'll have to leave immediately. It's safer for you both to stay outside. No way, we stay with Elida! It's okay. I can't worry about you two. Let's go. If anything happens to her, you'll have me to deal with. And then you'll wish those vines killed you instead. You have a pretty impressive threat game when you try. I spend too much time in my brother's bar. Although, in most of those fights, they... threaten each other's balls. Should I have done that? Nah. I think Hath got the message. Ah. Where do we go? Your mother spoke of a chamber that would only reveal itself to those of royal blood. Royal blood... So stupid. Guess it's that way. Wonder what we'll do after this. We should probably head back to Xija. Give Elida some time to figure this out. You can help me at my shop. If you can learn the difference between a crankshaft and a carburetor. Please. I can't even fly without autopilot. You'll all be better off without me. Have I been that hard on you? You, Isaac, are a better pilot than my brother. I have no idea if that's a compliment. It's... it's not. But a team is like an engine. Sure, you can get by for a whilewith one less spark plug, but eventually your combustion chamber is just gonna overheat, and the whole motor will fail. Point is... we're not better off without you, Isaac. The next step seems simple enough. Wait, Elida! - You have a better idea? - I do. We don't know what that thing will do. We can't have you test it. That's why I'm here. It's the least I can do. Your Majesty. It... it's a little snug, but... but how do I look? Ah! Dengar! Okay, you can do this, Elida. You have to do this. Elida! I wasn't aware of the consequences. Your life is something I will not trade. Now you wanna grow a backbone, Hath? Royal blood, remember? It's the only way. We have to leave. Now. Krob, let's go! Come on, come on. Elida, in order to use the Sterzaad... Tell me outside. Queen Eldaya. So good to see you again. I have imagined this moment so many times, but this right here... this is better than I ever could've dreamed. All this time, I thought the stories about the Sterzaad were nothing but fables. Meant to scare those who'd ever dare stand up to the monarchy. But, it makes so much sense now. Of course! Your ancestors took the throne by force. Hand it over. - Elida, wait. - Now, now, servant. We'll get to you. The Sterzaad? Now. Oh, goodness. This is too much fun. This is supposed to be incredibly powerful. Nothing is happening. You really kept her in the dark, haven't you? Okay. I don't like delays. No, no, no, wait, wait. Now, now, Isaac, where are you going? I couldn't have done this without you, partner. I... Isaac, what is he talking about? It wasn't meant to go this way. I had my officers search your Winni-pog ship on Xija Station. She's a little outta your league, wouldn't you say? The Republic are the only ones who have the technology for intergalactic travel. You're wasting my time. No ships will leave this port and you... will watch your friends suffer. Wait! We're headed to Wix. For Elida's mother. And who gave you this intel? - The Loyalists. - Well, then I'm doing you a huge favour by just killing you all now. There was something else they were after, The Loyalists, the... the star... Yeah, I really don't think we need - to do this anymore. - Sterzaad. - What did you say? - The Sterzaad. I don't know anything else. Sounded like some sort of weapon thing. Look... I was hoping to get one over Hath and take the thing when we got there, you know? Elida gets her mom, I get a cool bomb thing to sell. - Everybody's happy. - So, that's where it is. I wasn't even sure it existed. The stories state that only royal blood can claim it. Great, then you know what it is. So whatever it is, once Elida gets it, I will take off with it, I will deliver it to you. And in return, you will give me whatever ship you have capable of intergalactic hops. There's just one more thing. Elida, her mom, and Amae, they go free. Elida, she doesn't even want the crown, none of it. She's not a threat to you. A xifocal. What's... It's a beautiful device. A tracker and a surveillance system. Now, this is asking for a lot of trust on my part, Isaac. Now, I must dash. I'm sure that currently your friends are mounting a very heroic rescue. Wait. We gotta make this look as real as possible. Well, aren't you full of surprises. If we must do things your way... Ooh. This is a lot to take in in one day. First, Mommy isn't here, and now this. Double-crossed by your best friend. It's not true, right? You were supposed to have your mom. I was gonna take it and leave, and I'd get to go home. You'd get your family. I didn't know thatshe wasn't here, I swear to you. Or, that hewould show up. This wasn't the deal. As enjoyable as this reunion is, as you can see, time's not really on our side. The conduit. Hand it over. I'd die first. That can be arranged. Oops. Missed. No! Hath... Hath. Don't give him anything. Elida, duck! Krob! Goodbye, Eldaya. We have to go! Now! I'm sorry, Krob. We have to go now. This way. There should be another way out. Commander Lazaro. By orders of the Council of Admirals, you're under arrest. - Stand down! - Stop. Up ahead! It'll take us out. Wait, wait, wait, Isaac and Amae. Come on! - Elida! - Ah! Hath! Hath! Hath! Elida, go! No, I told you, I don't leave anybody behind. This tunnel. Follow it. - It'll take you out. - No. I'm so sorry I hurt you, my queen. Don't say that! I'm so proud of who you've become. - Hath! - Now, go. - Go! - No, no. - Take her! - Hath! Follow the tunnel. - Hath! - It's too late. Hath! I'm celebrating. 'Cause today, my child is born. And I know what you're thinking. Shouldn't I be there? And yes. But there is on Earth. And do you know where that is? It's another goddamn galaxy! Oh, hey! Hey, hey, man! Why don't we just go and chill out over here for a minute? It's a celebration, 'Cause today, my son or daughter was born. Or not. I mean, who frickin' knows? But, I should be there. Look, man, I shouldn't be telling you this, but if you wanna make enough cash for an intergalactic ship, you could start scavving. - What? - The good ones make a killing. The bad ones die, often in horrific ways. I will do anything to get home. Anything. I wish she'd just yell at me. Or shoot me. This is far worse. Give it time. She just might. El... We're done.
