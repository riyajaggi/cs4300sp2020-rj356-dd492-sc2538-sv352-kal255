 That is how  you landed a chosen... by maually able to writing  the lateral landing... You are making it more complicated than it needs to be. Autopilot always worked fine for me. You do know autopilot is an assist, it's not meant to replace piloting. - Duh! - This is exactly why she's in the shape she is now. Amae, how long 'til we're ready to leave? I need a few hours. Mostly to remove all the duct tape.

 Where the hell is here? Greibos. A rainforest-turned-dumping ground after the Narrows War. Species had no choice but to adapt. Aw. That's sad. So, how can I help? We do need gas. Badly. I got a reading on some old ships and tankers nearby. Copy. Um, it'll take the two of you to siphon off from one of those tankers. Just like old times. Oh, before you go! I found your comms bands in the electrics rooms.

 We can use them to stay in touch. Thought these were broken. - No, they just needed a charge. - Thank you. I know you risked a lot leaving Xija with us, and once we're off this planet, I promise we're gonna get you to Station Enthree. I can't have more blood on my hands. Yep. Haven't forgotten since the last time you told me. She can be a little dramatic at first. - She livens up? - Oh, totally. Show her pictures from Earth kittens, she's goop. You ready, numbnut? Earth... kit-ten. Oh, my crackers! Oh, that's so silly. So, you gonna tell me where my mother is? Yeah, of course. Let's just get out of here first. Not exactly the sort of place I want to be left stranded. Again. Ohh, look at this little cutie! That is adorable. Picking up signals of hydrocarbon about... ten clicks west. ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ *VAGRANT QUEEN* Season 02 Episode 01 Episode Title: "Yippee Ki Yay" Aired on: April 03, 2020 Thirty-five. That's how many of you I dispatched into Xija Station to find one tiny, little girl. And you failed because...? Sir, she had help. A human! And a puny mechanic. Against the Republic's best army. What do we have on them? Human drifter. No known affiliations. We picked him up a few weeks back. Claimed he had information to lead to Al-Feyr. Most of it was useless, but we kept an eye on him. Eventually led us to Xija. - And the mechanic? - Amae Rali. Orphan drifter from the planet Lorkis. The planet was destroyed 15 years ago. Such interesting specimens you've chosen, Eldaya. Reminds me of that time we had to steal Kruglean stones out of Crovax. You see that? All right. So the fuel tank should be around here somewhere. Aha, okay. So Amae said one of us has to siphon from the inside and the other collects the fuel out of here. Yeah, I'm gonna collect out here, I'm sensitive to mould. I'm sensitive to bullshit. You ready, Isaac? I'm always ready! We good? Isaac? Issac! Issac? Isaac?! Thanks. Asshole. - Thanks. - Yeah, no problem. Us scavs gotta have each other's backs, right? That's not usually how it works. It looks like you had a good sale today. I'm actually gonna meet with a bunch of Spiders right now. - Sell 'em this thing. - Word of warning: Spiders are notorious for under-cutting. Thanks for the heads-up. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on! Now this wasn't part of the deal. You can't just take me. I thought I was signing over the orb thingy. 'Kay, this is fraud! I'm a lawyer, dammit. Shit. Hey! Leftover siltanium... For cheap. Interested? Hell, yeah. That stuff's damn hard to come by. What do you want for it? - That. - That is a great deal. Sorry, darling, the captain's taken a liking. Wants to make a new jacket with his skin. Not my style if you ask me, but hey, what do I know about fashion? What'd he just say about my skin? Can't take a look at this rare find? See, I know you're just doing your job. And I really don't want to hurt you, so you give him to me, you take the siltanium, we call it a day. That is really cute. And even if it were remotely threatening, you're on club property. House rules. No scavving or stealing here. Very true. But... you just passed house lines about three feet back. House rules. Behind the line. Behind the house line. Wow! Where did you learn to fight like that? Raised by scavengers. Learn to fight or learn to die. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Grew up in Canada. Survival was just as brutal. That's on Earth, by the way. Kind of a long story. Anyway, I was catapulted to this side of the universe two years ago and I've been trying to get home ever since. That actually wasn't a long story. They'll be waking up pretty pissed soon, so you got a ship? Oh, yeah, she's a beauty. She's parked right over here. But there might be a slight issue with that. Look, on top of saving my life, I'll need one more favour. Isaac! Really? Dead battery? You gotta be kidding. Come on... Come on! Ah! Love that sound. Wait! I'm looking for someone. In Beader territory? Good luck. Charging station this way if you wanna reload, but I'd get outta here soon. Place will be swarming again in no time. Xija territories fall well outside the Republic sectors. You are to leave immediately. The last of a tyrannical bloodline was spotted here. We are close. This is awkward. We've heard that so many times now, Lazaro. Look, an ex-Marquis failing multiple times to catch one teeny-tiny little queen. You are aware, Admiral, that title was abandoned long before the Aristocracy was abolished. Long before I stormed the castle while you all watched on comfortably. Is... is that a dig? Oh, you're to send the Thunderer back here to Arriopa, where you'll be reassigned... - No. - - Lazaro. - The queen is not yet... - Dead, yes. Yes, yes, yes. We're all very aware. But you're wasting too many resources. You failed. Return to Arriopa. Of course, Admiral. We set course for Arriopa immediately. Oh. Okay, then. Well, we'll, uh... Shall I set course for Arriopa, sir? No. Not yet. Is he awake? Yes, sir. Good. Ouch, bro. You've looked better. Punks will regret the day they ever messed with Xija. Find somewhere to lay low for a while. I'm sure you've got booty calls all over the galaxy, right? Funny. - Where's Elida? - She's out for supplies. - Don't get carried away. - What's that supposed to mean? Elida's on her own path, Amae, and it's a dangerous one. We only got this far by playing it smart. So just go and find somewhere safe and I'll... Chaz? Chaz, you're breaking up. No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I finally got those breaker cables organized. Oh. Oh, oh, hold on. Are you kidding me? These guys need a lesson in productivity. Ah! Oh my... Really? Ah! Oh, gosh! Ah! Please work. Call Elida. Call Isaac. Where's the station? Thanks for all the help, Gladys. Not what I'm paid for. Bob. Oh, Bob. He just celebrated his 20th wedding anniversary. I'm really gonna miss you, you son of a hubglubon. Now, let's take a look at our newest challenger. And by the way, welcome to Greibos. So, uh, where you from? Look, I got things to do. Try not to sell yourself to pirates again. You're a lone wolf, I get it. Me too. I just need one tiny favour. My ship is currently being impounded and I, you know, I thought maybe you could use your... I am not on good terms with the parking authority. Good luck. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We can help each other out. I see you're headed to the Preyhound shuttle. I mean, public transport? Come on. You need a real ride. And I got a Troezan S900. - So you're offering me a ship? - Seventy-thirty. You know, we take turns piloting, we hit up the occasional scav joint, maybe we share the occasional whisky. No funny business. I'm a married man. Who's your partner? She's back on Earth. Look. You are ridiculously badass, and I'm, well, more personable. Pretty great team, if you ask me. - Fifty-fifty. - Sixty-forty. Okay, okay, okay. Fifty-fifty. You racked up this much in unpaid parking tickets? It is legit hard to understand parking regulations in space. I shoulda asked for more than fifty-fifty. Gonna wake up with a killer headache, buddy. But you'll be fine. Welcome... to your new home. Thatta girl. And away... We... go... I have a plan. Take the wheel. I learned this from one of Earth's most sacred tales. I call it, yipee ki yay! Yes, yes! Whoa! Yipee ki yay. Good move. Hey, sleepyhead. Isaac? What? Where are we? Let's get outta here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I learnt the hard way. These bars... are wired. Shit. Again, where are we? Please, take your seats and sharpen your knives. The next battle commences in five. Slowly does it. Become one with the land. I am a mossy junk creature. This is my home. And I definitely do not mind the smell. Okay. All right, so we're locked up by cannibals who will determine through some sort of battle who they'll eat? - Are they cannibals? - What? I mean, cannibals eat their own species, right? And we are not, well, whatever they are, so... would you still call them that? Well, the guys who dragged me here ate their friend. - Okay, was it the same spec... - Yes. I'm just checking. You know, instead of arguing with me about the semantics of cannibalism, how about, I don't know, you help me figure out how to get out. We've mostly been communicating through these lovely drawings. - Wow. - I know, he's good, right? What... what is that? It is, uh, best not to think about that. Let me get you one. Hey, robot maid! Ooh, what do we have here? I imagine we are in a Hansel and Gretal type situation. It tastes better than it looks. El, do you maybe wanna talk about what happened on Varook? - No. - You know, I didn't want it - to go down that way. - What part? The shooting me part or being a selfish asshole part? I- - I was being selfish? What are you, kidding me? - I trusted you and... - And I trusted you! Do you have any idea how hard that was for me? So, I had money down on the other guy, right? Looked like he had a decent set of fights in him. - But, man, he sucked. - Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Take us. We're ready. You're up in two blocks, but one might say you're hungry for battle. Yep. Never gets old. No, no, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. Amae is on her way. I'm sure she is, I'm sure... Yeah, yeah, I considered that, but given the situation, mm... taking off in your own ship, saving two randos that you just met... I know what I would bet on. Yeah, well not everybody thinks like you. Like us. Who're you kidding? So you know with this sale, we can afford one of these updates? - Hmm? - Mm-hmm. You know what that means? One step closer to Earth. Oh, you are gonna love it there. Alright, I'm gonna go prep Winnie. Get my leftovers. Keep the change. Interesting company you're keeping there. You wanna be careful. Oh, yeah? 'Cause she'll kick your ass. You've no idea, do you? Dude, really? You forgot my food? Two years. You have been lying to me for two frickin' years. Uh, some clarification? You're a goddamn queen. Uh, that. Yeah, it's not really something I advertise. It says here you're from Arriopa. So that means your poor scav family are actually rich frickin' royals? You don't know anything, Isaac. Because you didn't tell me. I've... I've been hiding since I was ten years old. - It's all I know. - I thought we were friends, El. We are. - It's just complicated. - Yeah, tell me about it. I just had to a pay a dude my cut to keep his mouth shut. Then it sounds like a pretty good time to get off this shitty planet. Let's go. We have been scavving together for two years. Everything that we have been through together, barely scraping by. Okay, look, I... I understand you're pissed, Isaac, but let's chat on the ship. Let's go. No, I mean, this whole time we coulda used this to make a ton of cash. No more scrounging. So... I thought this was about our friendship, - but this is about money? - Think about it. These Republic pricks, we take them for everything they've got. We stage sightings, we sell info, nothing dangerous. We are living like vultures, when we could be like kings. Like queens! You wanna know the first lesson I was taught as queen? How to wave? That I can never have friends. Goodbye, Isaac. Hell, no. Not on my ship. Oof! Are you kidding me? You'd leave me here stranded after everything I've done for you? Elida! Ah... Kinda like root-beer, with, like, a earthy kale aftertaste. El, you know I wasn't aiming for ya. I just wanted to stop you from leaving. We both know I got terrible aim; even if I was tryna hit you, I woulda been ten feet off. You want to make it up to me? Tell me where my mother is. I am. I will. Look, I tell you everything now, how do I know you just won't leave me stranded again? Given the current situation, one that we might not make it out of alive, I'd say it's a pretty good time - for you to just... - Guys. Guys. Amae? - And you rolled here? - It's called blending in. You know, getting into character. Okay, there's a key at the end. On it. Told you she'd come. Ohh my crackers! It's an S82K! I haven't seen one of these in over a decade. This is a highly advanced AI pairing system and... - Look what they've done to you. - Am-Amae? - A glorified drinks cart. - Amae! - Not the best time. - Right. Okay. - Ah... What's your cell? - Uh... Hey, what cell number are we? Seven. I can clearly see you're number seven. We're number three. I thought it was serendipitous when I arrived. - That's my favourite number. - We're number three! Three. Got it. Ugh, gross. Oh. Uh... uh... Oh, uh, uh... You're big. Oh. No! Whoa. Take this to cell three. Oh, shit! Ah! - Ah! - Oh, God. This is painful to watch. Oh, really? Ah! Crackers. How about some fruit punch? It's probably not fruit, though. What? Imagine that it is. You want your one-liners to be a little more organic. Can't forget about these? - Let's go! - Let's go. Ah! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - It's this way back. I saw a bunch of guards on the north... - Yeah, we go south. - What? This way, this way! That's not what I meant. - No time for a plan now. - Wait, we should really... There's always time for a plan! Really? You're a Tuk from planet Achuun? So far from the star colonies controlled by the monarchy. Why the allegiance? Nim thinks... what the Republic did... was nasty. You call yourselves revolutionaries. But Nim thinks you're just bullies. I'm... I'm sure you've been told wretched things about us, but, you know, you've been misled. We're a people's government. Liberators. The people that you worship blindly oppress. They value a bloodline without merit. But you... Nim. You have a chance to redeem yourself. Nim will tell you nothing. There is no honour in dying for a misguided cause. Six o'clock! Six, what... How about just behind you? It's a pretty universal way of explaining directions. Can you guys pipe down for, like, - a second so we can make a plan? - That's not really how we roll. We're more the shoot-your-way-out-type. Let's go east. When I surveilled the area, no Greibosians would head this way. It doesn't feel right. That's because there's just a bunch of mutant chimp-dogs this way. We have a better chance of taking them on. - Isaac, gimme your gun. - What, why?! Because I'm a better shot than you. That's weird. They're staying back. - Gimme the gun! - Who took out 50 attackers on Carillo just with one gun? They were Kleothian worms and they didn't have limbs! - Well, they had teeth! - Guys! - Something is in... - You're selling information on the last queen of Arriopa. Well, I'll tell you what I told the Admiralty. But it'll cost ya. All right. We used to hit up this joint called Glubs on Wreckoor all the time. She goes back there once every two moons. She's piloting a star freighter by the name Regina. Reg-eena. No, it is most definitely Regina. There's a steakhouse on Crovax she loves, try that. Give us a moment. Toodles. A steakhouse? She's been a vegetarian her whole life. Yeah, but she's had cheat days. What, you don't believe that I know her? No, I believe you know her, I believe you don't want to sell her out. You care about her. The Admiralty will kill her as soon as they find her, you know that. We're here to protect her. We're her family. She's got no family. We're done here. That brooch you hold? It's her mother's. You would trade her dead mother's broach? Pot calling the kettle black much? She believes her mother is dead? What? What are you saying? She's alive. In prison, on planet Wix in the Republic Space. Yeah, I... I don't want that. Keep it. If you ever do see her again. We escaped Xija, infested with Admiralty. I... I mean, what happened just now should not have been a difficult situation. We had guns. I had a way out. But neither of you listened. My brother would be so mad at me. He's had my back since we were kids. And he's tried to keep me out of trouble ever since. So... why'd you come after us? Because everyone needs someone to have their back. And it doesn't sound like you two have each other's. I mean, we used to. She's on planet Wix, El. Your mother. That's all the guard told me, I swear. And I've been a shitty friend. And selfish. And I never even asked why you were trying to hide. I'm sorry, El. I wanna make it right. Time for the battle. Ha, ha, ha! Yes, Allow me to introduce to you the final battle of the evening! What the hell kind of battle is this? I hope you left some room for dessert. Because both items on the menu look positively delicious. They want us to cook Peter. - Aw, that's his name? - I don't know. He answered to it once so it just kinda stuck. No weapons, hand-to-hand combat? Now you all know the rules. The winner lives to face another day while the loser becomes barbecue chew-flé! And tonight, we have something really special for you all. A little number composed from the fleshy one's home planet... Earf! Am I saying that correctly? - Earf? - Huh. Earf! Now, let the best meal... lose. Take it away. What is happening? Oh my God.

Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Go, I'll catch up! - Sounds good! Really? Are you kidding me? You piece of... Oh, you thought that I was gonna...? That's awkward. Amae. Take her away. Fifteen years ago... I promised to kill a measly ten-year-old queen. Last of a tyrannical bloodline. I mean, I should've been offered a seat at the Admirals' table. But... ...she escaped. I mean, you know how exhausting it's been? The life she's forced me to lead? I've become a joke to the Republic. A mockery. Do I seem like a joke to you? Because you've been wasting my time! Well, now that's a shame. That sort of loyalty would've been rewarded, were you on the right side of history. Oh! You went back for this? Yeah, it's not a big deal. You said it might come in handy around the ship, so... Yeah. It's pretty cool. You're gonna hook her up for us before we drop you off at the next station? - I'm coming with you. - What? To Wix. To get your mom. Hey, look, I... I can't have more... Blood on my hands, yeah, you said. Thing is, the two of you won't last five minutes without me. I've seen blood, war, pain. More than you understand. Like you, I've spent my life just surviving. Yeah, but it's not your fight. Imagine if everyone thought that. It would be a pretty schlucky universe. Excuse my language. We'll, um... make up a room for you. Do you think she'd be okay if I labelled our bathroom shelves? Knock yourself out. Okay. Let's go. I don't see them showing up on the planet now. Huh. Must've just missed them. Oh. They're approaching Qualla. Oh. We won't fail. Again. You guys looking for a good time? Well, it's been a tough couple of days. That sounds like a really lovely... No, thank you. Not the sort of good time you're looking for. Oh. Thanks, anyways. What's the problem? We'll get the next ones. ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪
