 Jackpot. Looks like we got some scavenger competition. This day just got interesting. Ah, ah, ah... Drop it. Well, well... What do we have here? Nigel, it's pretty clear this is another scavenger. I know it's a scavenger, Carl. Stealin'...

 That's a pretty major penalty. Are you concerned about that? 'Cause we came here to steal too. - Shut up, Carl! - Come on, guys. Scavenger to scavenger, this is my find. Oh, yeah, scavenger honour code and all. But, uh... I don't really care. So we'll be taking that. You look... familiar. I know your face.

 I'm sure I do. Karaoke bar on Crovax, right? Do I look like I karaoke? Well, I try not to judge a book by its cover. Carl over there, face like a boar's ass, voice of an angel. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Oh, and that ship of yours? We'll be taking that too. It's a classic. Last chance to stop being a dick. Oh, sorry! I missed the part where you had a gun and I don't and you have any say in this whatsoever. Oh, my gosh! Sing for me now, bitch. I can come up with a better one- liner than that. Whatever. I'm gonna work on that. You got blood on my new... Jacket, Carl. ♪ We don't ever stop ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ *VAGRANT QUEEN* Season 01 Episode 01 Episode Title: "A Royal Ass-Kicking" Aired on: March 27, 2020 Mom, no! Shit... Boosters at 30%. Ah, I heard you the last time. Are you kidding me, Vado? This looks like junk, Elida. 'Cause it is junk, junk that you asked for. Look, this is Cibarian salvage. It doesn't grow on trees. You know, blood was spilt for that. And I'm guessing it wasn't your blood, so no big deal. This stuff just doesn't go for what it used to, okay? Demand is down. Yeah, but you're offering a fraction of what we agreed on. You've been in this business long enough to know I don't honour bad agreements. So, take the offer or nothing at all. Excellent. Hey, it's always a pleasure, Elida. Chaz. Hook me up. Bad day? Vado ripped me off again, so... nothing out of the ordinary. Vado, no way. That was supposed to be my big score. Pretty sure I've heard that before. Not thinking of retiring, are you? Can't imagine a scavenger's pension plan is any good. I'm done with this life on the run. Getting as far away from any semblance of my past sounds... - pretty damn good right now. - Ah, look around. Everyone here's running from their past. Nah, this one's on the house. Thanks, Chaz. Back to the grind. Wherever you're heading, be safe out there, El. The Republic were spotted this way recently, so... Those assholes think they own the galaxy. - Mm. - Besides, don't think I'm headed anywhere anytime soon. Boosters are fried. Fancy that, you're in luck. We've got a new mechanic on the station, so just mention my name. She'll give you a discount. And why is that? Well, I've got a number of photos from her awkward teen years. What are big brothers for, right? Thanks, Chaz. Hello? Hello! Ooh! Uh, um, I'm sorry. You must be Amae. That's me. Uh, I'm sorry. I'm closed. Turns out no one this side of the galaxy knows how to take proper care of their transformers and I have a huge backlog. But I could really use your help getting off the station. Your... your brother sent me. Oh, well, any friend of Chaz's... is someone I'm instantly wary of. What you got for me, then? Uh... Uh... Not just your boosters, my friend. When was the last time you checked your power regulators? - Mm... - I can repair it for 1,000 units or replace it for about 3,000. Okay, so, uh... tape isn't gonna work anymore? Oh. Mm- mm. Look, I've got an old S900 regulator back at my shop. It's not gonna last long but it'll sort you out for now. I can fix it in for half. What's the catch? You can buy me a beer at my brother's bar later. Xija Station is not responding. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, full house! We got a full house! Take it off. Take it off! - As I get two back. - Oh. Shit. Xija Station, receiving. This is first priority Admiralty transmission. Prepare to receive our boarding party. Admiralty? Suspend all departing flights until further notice. Yes, sir. You're clear to land. Oh... Oh, guys, I think I had a little bit too much. Oh, hey... Launch the shuttle. This is a message from the Republic of Arriopa All transportation in and out of Xija is temporarily suspended while we search the station for a fugitive. Failure to comply will result in your arrest. This is a message from the Republic of Arriopa. All transportation in and out of Xija - is temporarily suspended... - The Republic... ...While we search the station for a fugitive. What the hell are those punks doing here? ...This is a message from the Republic of Arriopa. All transportation in and out of Xija is temporarily suspended while we search the station - for a fugitive. - We're out of time. I can't believe this. Have security lock down the entire promenade. - Oh... - Oh, I am way too high for this. These Republic goons have no jurisdiction here. Greetings, most excellent managerial staff of Xija Station. Love what you've done with your hair. Now, I know this is highly irregular. You can say that again. We have a mutual agreement here, commander. You don't touch Xija property and we turn a blind eye to the Republic's illegal dealings here. Mm... Oh, this was my father's. Yeah, the craftsmanship is sublime. Now, if you move I might accidentally poke an eye. Our deference to Xija Station will continue once we're done with our business. We're in pursuit of a fugitive and we've tracked her... here. We have lots of fugitives from all over the galaxy. Uh, but, now this one is special. The future of our republic depends on her capture. Do you have any objection? We remain allies of the Republic. Excellent! Now, if you'll excuse us... We have a queen to kill. -  - She's over here! Eldaya, we must go. What... what's going on? They're here. Remember our drills? Sir, over here! Go! We'll hold them back. Hey! Let go! Ugh! Run, Eldaya. Never look back. Hurry, Eldaya! Mom, get in. Heading out so soon? - Trust only yourself. - Mom, no. So good to see you, old friends. No, Mom! Mom, no! Mom! Mom! Mom! No! Mom! Hey, assface, this is costing me money. Could you hurry it up? - - Ugh! - - Back off. - What the... - Perfect. Hey! Get back here! Oof! Ugh... Gross. Well, let me out, then. I have a better idea. Uh... I guess better is subjective in this situation. Why don't you take me in and recycle me instead? See this next button? It opens that there gate. Happy flying! Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait,. You know what, Lazaro will be pissed if you take this away from him. No, I'll get my third star and my own company assault carrier. Then I won't have to drive around with Malcolm anymore. I mean, I dented the bumper once, once! Now he won't let me near the controls. He's not my dad. Man, you are so right. Yeah, but... but, Lazaro has been dreaming of killing me for 15 years. You know, he'll kill you. He'll kill you if you take away this one chance of closure. You're right. Yeah. I'll deliver you to him myself. He'll be so... You... You're welcome. I had it under control. Yeah, looked that way. Such a poignant moment for our reunion. You, swimming in crap, me, here to put you back on your feet. How about some helpful gravity? Yeah, I... can do this... - myself. - Uh- huh. - Fine. - You know, queenie... for somebody trying to hide you damn well make a show of yourself. This place is off the map. You'll be safe here. Kinda. They've always stayed out of Xija business. Lay low, Elida. - Thanks, Chaz. - Yeah. I may have played a small, tiny part in why they're here. Why doesn't that surprise me, Isaac? - I was selling you out. - What? Okay, wait, wait, wait, that came out wrong. Look, I sold them some useless information but they might have followed me here. Okay, okay, okay, so... You... led the Admiralty... here. Okay, not intentionally. Look, I needed cash, and bad, I had nothing. - When you took my ship... - No, no, my ship. My ship, claimed it the second you put a bullet in me! Oh, you are still not over that, eh? You shot me, Isaac! Yeah, for which I profusely apologized. No, you never apologized! Okay, fine. I am sorry that you made me shoot you. Made you shoot... You know what... Elida, I was pissed that you left. But I know why you did. I was desperate, and the Admiralty, they offered me a bunch of units to get the hell off that place. I'll be honest, I thought that they might be able to get me back to Earth, to Hanna. Don't be so stupid, Isaac. Nobody even knows how to get to Earth and even if it was possible, what, you think selling me out was a noble way to get back to your wife, huh? You think she'd be proud of you? I gave them useless shit, El! Nothing that would actually lead them to you. Current situation excluded. Look, and maybe... I should have been a little more careful about getting here. You are right. I am stupid. I am extremely good looking and a way better pilot than you, but I'm stupid. Move. Move along. Get out of here. You, clear out. What can I get you? When I was a child... I took a swig from a bottle in my father's liquor cabinet while he was entertaining some entitled aristocratic types. I was very... careful. I even topped it back up with water to make sure he wouldn't notice what went missing. Turns out... he had a security camera in his study. He played me back the footage of my misdemeanor before giving me... a burning reminder not to be a naughty boy. Alright, so a beer, then? Oh, you're wicked! No, no... On duty. Searching for a fugitive. I'm hoping you can help me. This is Xija. Everyone and their aunt's a fugitive. Lot of travelling folk passing by here, so... No, this one frequents here often. Elida Al- Feyr. Must be quite draining to meet so many new people day in, day out. I can understand your momentary lapse of memory. If say you were to remember this fugitive it would be met with benevolence, not punishment. Like I said, lot of people pass by here. Shit... I think you've been lying to me. Naughty boy. And there are severe punishments for royal sympathizers. This is gonna hurt... you... a lot more than it's gonna hurt me. So... after you decided to stop freeloading off the guys who... overthrew the monarchy, killed me entire family and burned my home you thought you would stop off and what, - be best buddies again? - Well, to be honest, I really didn't wanna see you again. But I learned some things while I was there that you need to know so I left and I came here to wait for you. What things, Isaac? We gotta talk somewhere safe. We gotta get to Peggy. To who? Uh, the Winnipeg? My ship? Yeah, I saw you talking to a mechanic, so please tell me that it was just to install a new coffee cup holder. That thing's a piece of crap, Isaac. Wow, she was running perfectly the last time I saw her. Oh, no, no, don't you try to blame this on me, numbnuts. Do you know how much tape I found holding those thrusters in place? Okay, you don't know what you're talking about, 'cause that's how we fix things on Earth and it works every time, so if she's not working now it's something you've done! Amae's shop is on the East wing but they've got the place covered. I can get you out of here there's just one condition. You are in no position to be negotiating. Well, neither are you, so I want Peggy back. Wait, you didn't warn me about this earlier because you wanted me in this position. Wow! Wow, you know, you had me for a second. - - I needed a chip at the table. - - Mm. But that does not mean that I'm not true to my word. I can help you to get out of here, I just... - I need... - I'm not as stupid as you look, asshole. And I don't need your help. Wait... - There's something... else. - That went well. Ladies and gentlemen, always have your boarding pass and identity documents with you... Identification. Now. Clear to go. I wouldn't do that, my Queen. You shoot and there will be 20 more here in seconds. Please... C- come with us. No thanks, creep. We are loyal to the crown, to the true Arriopa. Please give us a moment of your time. Get out of here. Fine. Come this way. Mm- mm, no. No, no, no, no, hey. No, get up. Yeah, there you go. We've been searching for you far and wide, holy queen Eldaya. We are loyal servants of the crown. I betroth my life to you. Okay, there's a reason I wanted to stay hidden, and it's Elida now, by the way. Our guardian of the House of Bel- Ior. No. - Empress of the third spiral... - No, okay, no, no, no. If I'm so important to you you would do exactly what I said and shut up right now, okay? Eldaya... - Oh, sorry, Elida. - There you go. That's very similar to your actual... anyway, you'll have to forgive our enthusiasm. Protecting the crown is our life's mission and when you disappeared we feared the worst. Disappeared, no. No, no, no, no. I escaped. And I'm not a queen, not anymore. Well, they think you are. The Republic and Commander Lazaro will stop at nothing to find you and kill you. Yeah, well I've been running from them pricks for 15 years, so nothing new. There's no reason to do that alone. You have a loyal army here to help protect you. Protect me? The way you protected my mother? There's not a day that passes that I don't mourn your mother. The colony had no warning of the attack. This is what she wanted, for you to live amongst your people, loyalists of true Arriopa. The Arriopa you knew is dead. Oh, gosh, come on, guys, get over it. The monarchy is dead. The revolution destroyed everything. They took my crown, and guess what? I got over it. You love the crown so much, why don't you take it? Or you? My light divine, we are not of royal blood. Oh god, my light divine, really? Look, I am not your nightlight in this shitty darkness. And if you're not gonna help me get off this station - then I guess we're done here. - Of course we'll help you! It's why we're here. They have all the docks on lockdown right now. We can't get you back to your ship, but we have an unmarked star drifter in the lower berth. We can get you to safety. Star drifter, that's an upgrade. I guess Isaac's gonna get his precious - Peggy back after all. - What's that? Nothing. We'll have you there in a few hours, once I get the all- clear. Until then, please, relax. You must be hungry. Uh, Nim! Prepare some food for Queen... Excuse me, Elida. Nims on it. So, who do I have to behead around here to get a beer? Again, Eldaya. I don't want to, I'm tired. You've got this. Ow, Hath! - I taught you better than this. - I wish you were still surrounded by the comforts and luxuries of your childhood, but that is not the life you lead now. Why cant we just, I dunno, disappear? Go somewhere where the Republic cant find us? You'll never be safe from them. The foreseeable future will be a battle for you, my love. And we must prepare you for that. Good. Your training is paying off. Its because I don't get to do anything else. Normal teenagers have friends, Ma. Normal teenagers are not queens. With friendship comes trust... and that is something you can never afford to give, my love. Rest up. You have target practice in the morning. Mm, this is actually... pretty good. Oh, thank you. Family recipe. Mm, you're Tuk, right? - Yeah. - So, howd you end up in the corner of the galaxy with these w... Loyalists? Nim does not like what the Republic did. Not one bit. Would like them to give your home back. Not sure I really want it back. We've secured the ship. Well be able to move soon. Mm, copy that, Denny- boy. What? Helping a fugitive escape, that's a serious offence little lady. - Where is she? - Oh, my crackers, do you have any idea how dangerous it is unplugging a grinder from the mains while its being used? - Wrong answer. - Wait, um... No, no, no, no, no, those are alphabetized... Now that you've successfully mixed up my eight- inch needle- nose pliers with my ten- inch groove joints, are you satisfied that shes not here? We haven't checked everywhere. What? Oh, really? Cool. Okay, yeah. And you are? Uh, just a customer. - - Carry on. - - Oh well. Looks like were just gonna have to take him for questioning. Really? Come on. Wheres my ship? The Winnipeg? Big, old, beautiful. Oh, crap. This wasn't a part of the plan. -  - Im Isaac, by the way, old friend of Elidas. Dont suppose you know where she is? Were completely off the grid. A launch won't set off any alarms. - Where are we going? - Our base camp. A few hops away. Im sorry my Queen, I cant tell you more. Not here. But, oh my... are people gonna be so excited to see you! Great. Greetings Xija! The Republic thanks you for your patience. While the search for the fugitive continues, please be advised that any and all monarchy sympathizers... shall receive severe punishment... Chaz... Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated. Huh, that is a good move, Lazaro. Goin after the one person on this station Elida would save: her bartender, right? That... that's my brother. Sorry. Your majesty, we must leave now. There is no time for this. - I c3ant leave Chaz like this. - My queen, he seems like a lovely bartender, but we must go. Theres only a small chance that... Just go without me! You heard what he said, hell kill any monarchy sympathizers. Just go. That's very noble of you, courageous. I love that! It... Its just that the entire colony needs you more - than this one man. - Im so sorry... You are the last of a royal bloodline. We cannot let the monarchy die out. Woah, woah, woah, hold on. You go running off like this, you're gonna ruin my plan. It is fine, they're just using your brother as bait to get to Elida. Just being used as bait? Uh, why? Look, no offence, but we really don't have time for this. Listen here, I know every nook and cranny on this station and theres no way Im letting these Republic goons get away with this so, - maybe Ill help you out, hm? - Okay. Why is my brother being used to capture a scavenger? - Heres the thing... - That scavenger is actually the Queen of Arriopa. Well, she was before the revolt. Yeah, shes been on the run from the Republic since - she was a little kid. - Hm. Queen? Wow, okay. Elida is a lot of things. Im... Im far too much of a gentleman to mention, but shes loyal and they know that shes gonna go after your brother. Okay. Well, we need a plan. Yeah, thatll just come to me in a moment. You take the bigger one. Won't be a perfect fit, but you can slouch. I like where your heads at. Ow. Mmph. You... you hit me. You hit a queen. It sounds terrible when you describe it that way. How else would you describe it? Im so sorry, Your Highness. There was a small hiccup in our plans. We can leave soon. Im not going anywhere with you creeps. I think you'll make a magnificent queen. You were so young before. You sound like a broken record. Look, I do not want to be your queen, okay? So, just... - just let me go. - You could produce an heir. You're the last of a royal bloodline. Do you not hear the crazy? Okay, alright. Ihred, right? That's your name. - - I should tell you something. - - Yeah. Come, come. Little bit closer. You learn a thing or two in the scav business - Oh? - Sleep tight, my loyal subject. You're making this very difficult. Ooh... Uh, Your Highness, Nim believes supporting the throne is supporting the Queens decisions. Well, even if that decision is not to be Queen. - Thank you. - We get Chaz now. Wait, wait, this is pretty much a suicide mission from here, - so we should split ways. - You need Nim. Cmon! Alright, its just the two of them. - - Nims got this. - - Okay, lets go over the plan. Nim, Nim! Hello officers. - - Move along. - - Wait. How might Nim apply to become... an Admiralty officer? Whatre you? Three feet? Actually, come to think of it, shrimp, you could fit easily into the sewerage pipes. - Huh? - Give 'em a good cleaning. - Ooh. - Move on. Hey, Nim could be an asset: Im small, nimble, good for sneaking... What do ya say? Hey! Hold still, shrimp won't stop moving. - You shot me, Neil! - Sorry! Hey! - What was that? - What? You totally went off book. Nim is a black belt in improv. - Mmkay. - No, please. I won't say anything. Ah, see, heres the thing... we need you to do just that. Sir, live podcast from sector 4B. Commander, we've detained a fugitive. Oh, my... Reunited at last. - Bring her here. - Um, help required bringing her in, sir. She said theres a large loyalist colony on the station and they're heading this way. Shes a dirty liar, officer. Thought so too, sir, but looks like theres a hidden ship below her. Move out! You think that they would design these uniforms differently, you know? Like, if you're gonna have all your officers in the same uniform, maybe don't make it so easy to infiltrate. This thing stinks. They should really use sanitizer between every use. Oh, god. You got this, Amae. You're an officer. You got top marks at... officing school. You ready? Yeah! Lets go! We need to transfer the prisoner. - - Why? - - 'Cause... Because he's wanted for more - - questioning on the fugitive. - - Fugitive was just found. Bringing her in now. Is she uh... fugitive alive? Dunno. So again, why do you need this prisoner? Uh, um... Sold me some bad Kromuline dust. Stuff was weak as shit. Would like to uh, teach him a lesson. Catch my drift? Move. I win best sibling award this year. -  - You. You played a part in this trickery. No sir, she... she had help. They made me make the call... The simple answer is, yes. What do they say, um, before such a great performance? Its... Break a leg. I know, Im a little late on the sentiment. Agh! Find her. You and Chaz should hide. They're gonna be taking Elida to the Republic shuttle. And, I have to go. Hey, uh... where you taking that prisoner? Our commands are on a need- to- know basis. Uh, where ya going with that one? Uh, same, uh, need- to- know basis, thingy. Go, Republic... Go, Republic. Okay, playtimes over. The prisoner. Now. What's this about? Hey, that's not even a real prisoner. No shit, asshat. Elida? What the hell? Isaac? - Whatre you doin here? - Were trying to save you! I know you're a mechanic and all, but theres really - no fixin this piece of crap. - Ah? I see you been workin' - on your one- liners. - Yeah, he's a total nincompoop but, he helped me out when some Admiralty goons - came knocking for you. - Nim is confused. We all had the same idea. I swear, I saw this in a movie once. I mean, they really gotta reconsider these uniforms; this is just way too easy. Hey! They're over here! -  - Run! Run! There you go. Wow, shes not as cool as I thought shed be. - Disappointing. - We failed. We must find her. Dengar, Ihred! The Admiralty are on this level. We must leave now! He's wounded! Well find her. Im taking my ship back and getting the hell outta here. Look, I didn't get to fix the new regulator in, so you start that thing up now and your diffusers - gonna blow the distribution. - Hey, vernacular we understand, Amae. Ships not going anywhere. - Dammit. - Unless... I like where this is going. I can manually distribute the power to shut off the thruster. - Really sis, help us out. - I can do it. I just need to be on the ship when you take off. Oh, no, no, no, no. Its too dangerous for you to come. I cant have more blood on my hands. Let's just get out of here. Well drop her off - at the nearest planet. - Mm- hm. Who said you were coming with me? Oh, listen. Please. Nim thinks you should save the chit- chat for a bit later. We have bigger problems. They started a war stepping on Xija property. Theres not one outlaw or mafioso who will let them get away with it. Ill give you cover from the platform above, take out as many of these goons as I can. You call me the second you land somewhere safe. - Ill come get you. - See you soon, bro. Uh, Nim believes saving Elida gets him a free ride outta here. Oh yeah, you're good. You, not so much. Goodbye Isaac. - Elida, please, we need to talk. - Or what? - What, you'll shoot me again? - Woah. What's that now? Yeah. It is not how it sounds. Okay, its exactly how it sounds. But, this is not about my ship. Its your mother. Shes alive. I made a mistake selling you out. But, it led me to this. Is that my mothers? How...? Who gave this to you? No. I promise I will tell you everything and help you get to her. I just want Peggy back. My ship, for your mother. Deal? Lets go. What the hell, commander? My station is a mess. When I speak to the council of Admirals, you'll be demoted so fast you won't have time to... -  - I will destroy... more than your damn station if this vermin isnt found. Nows as good a time as ever. Show off. Oh! You okay? Oh, now you worry about me being shot? Nim make boom! He can stay. Nim! Lets go! Cmon, cmon. Ill get to the engine room. - Nim! Cmon! - Cmon. Dah! - Nim! - Leave him, El. Oh... Good boy. Look at this. Queen Eldaya Al- Feyr, responsible for yet another innocent life. Let him go. Of course. You know the trade. No. No! There are still those who believe in you. It was Nims honour. Yeah, that's a beautiful sentiment but really, I... Long live Elida! No! - El, I dont... - Sit down. Amae, ready? - Ready! - Update. The Loyalists escaped, sir. The people of Xija have grown restless - - and are starting to fight back. - - We don't have enough officers to hold down the station. Well, it appears we've overstayed our welcome. Prepare the shuttle. Should I call the Admiral, sir? - - Oof! - - Anyone else? Any smart ideas? Ugh. What has she done to you? Im so sorry about Nim. Didnt really know him. Cant afford to know anybody. Well, that's not fair. Thank you. For all of your help, Thank you. You're welcome. Station Emthree is not too far, we can get you to safety soon. So, um... I noticed a couple names back there. Is it Elida, or Eldaya? Eldaya was my royal name. I changed it to stay hidden. -  - No, no, that is a great undercover name. That is completely stealth. Where are we going, Isaac? Republic space. I could guess that much, its not a small area. Where? Last time I saw you, you left me stranded on a remote planet. Im keeping whatever cards I have left close to my chest for now. You're an asshole. No, Im a lawyer and a good one. - That wasn't me. - No, we've lost the back- up piston. The Weeniepacks not gonna make it to the next station. Its Winnipeg. Win- ni- peg. Winnipeg! How can nobody get that right? We have to land before I can fix it. Ill find the nearest planet. Oh! Hang on tight! ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪
