 SpongeBob SquarePants (1999–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - BubbleStand/Ripped Pants - full transcript 
 BubbleStand: SpongeBob introduces Patrick and Squidward to his unique talent, the art of bubble blowing. After first turning his nose up at this plebeian pastime, Squidward accepts the challenge and attempts to surpass SpongeBob's level of expertise. Squidward's plan to humiliate SpongeBob completely "blows up" in his face. Ripped Pants: When SpongeBob tries to impress Sandy Cheeks at Mussel Beach, he accidentally rips his pants. SpongeBob is embarrassed until he realizes the beach crowd thought he jokingly did it on purpose. SpongeBob's ripped pants are the hit of the beach, until he pushes the joke too far.
