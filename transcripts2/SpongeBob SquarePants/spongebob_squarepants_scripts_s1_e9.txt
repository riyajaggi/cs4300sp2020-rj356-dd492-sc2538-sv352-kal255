 SpongeBob SquarePants (1999–…): Season 1, Episode 9 - Nature Pants/Opposite Day - full transcript 
 Nature Pants: After suffering through some unusually rough days at work, SpongeBob decides to leave his industrialized life and "live off the land" with the jellyfish in JellyFish Fields. A rough day on the job, however, is nothing compared to a rough day of trying survive in nature amongst the jellyfish. SpongeBob is forced endure cold nights, bad food, and being pursued by the jellyfishing Patrick! Opposite Day: Fed up with SpongeBob and Patrick, Squidward decides to sell his house and move. Worried no one will buy it if they see what their neighbors will be really like, Squidward fools them into thinking it's 'opposite day,' and they must do the opposite of their usual behavior. No such luck, however. With those two, the opposite of crazy is still crazy.
