 SpongeBob SquarePants (1999–…): Season 1, Episode 4 - Naughty Nautical Neighbors/Boating School - full transcript 
 Naughty Nautical Neighbors: In order to get peace and quiet, Squidward plays a cruel joke on SpongeBob and Patrick which makes the two believe they are no longer friends. But the joke backfires on Squidward when SpongeBob and Patrick relentlessly compete with Squidward to be his new "best friend". To get relief, Squidward is forced to reunite the feuding SpongeBob and Patrick. Boating School: It's exam time again at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. SpongeBob, in his never ending quest to pass the boat driving section of the exam, turns to Patrick for help. The two come up with the brilliant idea of planting a walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's head so that Patrick can direct him from afar. All goes well until SpongeBob realizes he may be cheating!
