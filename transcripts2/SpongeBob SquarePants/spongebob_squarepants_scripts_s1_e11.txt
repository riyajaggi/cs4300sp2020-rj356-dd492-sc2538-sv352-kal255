 SpongeBob SquarePants (1999–…): Season 1, Episode 11 - MuscleBob BuffPants/Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost - full transcript 
 MuscleBob BuffPants: SpongeBob finds Sandy's rigorous physical training program too tough and chooses the easy way out by ordering a pair of fake 'bulky arms' as seen on TV. Fooling everyone with his new muscles, SpongeBob finds out there's no substitute for hard work when Sandy enters them both in the Muscle Beach Anchor Toss competition. Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost: SpongeBob and Patrick accidentally hit 'Squidward' with a flying shell, thinking they knocked him out. They place what is really a wax replica next to the heater, melting him. When a talcum-covered, real Squidward emerges from the bathroom, the boys think it's a ghost. Squidward sees this as his great chance to get the two to leave him in peace.
