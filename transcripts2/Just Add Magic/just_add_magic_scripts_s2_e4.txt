 Previously on "Just Add Magic"... I'm telling you, he took a bite, and then just disappeared into thin air. That wasn't the spell. It was just supposed to keep him away from magic. We've got to bring him back. We will, Gina. I promise. If you really wanted to bring him back, why didn't you just use your morbium? He stole my seed when he stole Ida's. I think Grandma lied to us.

 So you don't remember anything. It's all a blank. But his memories can come back. And that makes him a ticking time bomb. ♪♪ ♪♪ I shouldn't have told you. Hey, Chuck. Come ride the Ferris wheel with me. Give it back. You don't know what you're doing. - [gasping] - Oh! Sorry. I didn't see you there. Uh, are you hungry? Yeah. Starving.

 Do you like eggs? Yes, ma'am. Uh, do not call me ma'am. It's weird. There's fruit on the table, I'll start the eggs. ♪♪ It's really good. You should try it. Go ahead. Try it. Everything okay? Never better. ♪♪ So how exactly does Can't Recall Caramel send Chuck away for 50 years? And make him 14 forever, and give him amnesia? Sorry I'm late. I was hanging out with my parents. Great news. They're getting back together. That's amazing. But they've been divorced for, like, a year. So when did they tell you? Well, they haven't yet. But my dad's been over all the time lately. Trust me. It's happening. They went to a movie last week, had lunch a few days ago, and last night we played board games as a family. And my mom let my dad win, just like old times. I'm really happy for you, Darbie. Thanks. Me, too. What are we doing? We are trying to figure out how the Can't Recall Caramel sent Chuck away. I'm guessing magic. Sorry. Focusing now. Maybe they added some extra livonian sugar. Or something more powerful. Miss Silvers said that she didn't like the way your grandma used her morbium. You think she used it on Chuck? I don't think Grandma would do that. Man, I wish we could go back, and see what happened that day. Well, me, too, but we already used once in a lifetime Pick-A-Date dates to go back to Halloween. Yeah. Not upset about that at all. What if we use the Bitter Truth Truffles on Grandma? The OCs aren't gonna eat anything we give them. So it's gotta be something we eat. Oh, I think I saw something the other day. If These Walls Could Taco. "Places know the secrets you seek, "the scene of the crime, so to speak," "put your hands upon the wall, "and close your eyes to reveal it all." Oh, there's more. "Know that when you lend an ear, "you may not like all you hear." We should go to Miss Silvers' house. That's where they used to do all their cooking. We could see if anyone added anything to the caramel apple. Great idea. Then we can make sure that Grandma's telling the truth. What if we find out your grandma did use it on Chuck? You gonna be okay? I'd rather know the truth. Dad. What are you doing? Looking for my old turntable and LPs. Why don't you just listen to music on your phone like the rest of the world? Um, because I love music. I want to hear it in it's purest form. Vinyl, kiddo. Ooh, you have to hear this. It's the Rolling Stones live at the Fillmore. That's really cool, Dad, but maybe later. We're kind of in the middle of something. An attic? Uh, yes, we're here to... play with these dolls. My name's Rosalinda. I have five houses and three maids. And I am Jane. And I need a doctor. Guess I'm not the only one going vintage today. Have fun. Feel better, Jane. [sighs] That was close. We need elysian cayenne and torian cumin. Here they are. ♪♪ [piano playing] I told you Miss Silvers keeps her door unlocked while teaching piano. Ready? [sighs] All right, walls, show us the day the OCs cooked the caramel apple. Or not. Oh. The riddle said that we had to touch the walls. Let's touch 'em at the same time. [piano playing continues] Okay, on three. - One-- - Wait. On three or after? On. No, after. One, two, three. Whoa. When does your mom get home? Not for a few hours. Let's get started. Whoa. I don't think they can see us. This is so cool. And weird. But mostly cool. Look at Grandma's clothes. She's so cute. I can't believe Miss Silvers hasn't updated her kitchen in 50 years. Are we sure we should do this? He stole my morbium seed. Who knows what he'll do with it. I agree with Ida. We're the keepers of the magic. We have to keep it safe. [sighs] Agreed. So precise. We're good, but I think they might be better. They had to mix everything by hand. Exhausting. And wash everything by hand. No dishwasher. ♪♪ It looks exactly like the apples that they sell at the festival. They didn't add anything to the recipe. It was cooked perfectly. Well, then, how did it make Chuck disappear into thin air? So what's gonna happen after he eats the apple? He'll forget about the magic that you told him about. But not about us, right? I hope he does forget us. - Ida. - What? All I know is that when Chuck's around, bad things happen. Chuck's not as bad as you two think. Well, tell that to my dad who lost his job because of Chuck. What? You still don't know that it was Chuck's fault. Who else could have done it? I don't want us to fight. Please. [sighs] Why were they even friends with him in the first place? And why was he messing with Mama P's dad? Never thought I'd feel bad for Mama P. After this, we can finally have a carefree summer of fun. Well, that sounds familiar. Are you ready for this? Do I have a choice? I'm the only one that he trusts. Ida: It's going to be fine. You give him the apple, and when he forgets about magic, you get my morbium back. We'll meet you at Corky's after the festival. I wish we could taco to those walls. Worth a shot. [sighs] Okay. On three. - Do you mean-- - After. One, two, three. [piano playing] Come on, let's go. [doorbell rings] Hey, little man. Can I come in? I'm not supposed to let strangers in. Uh, hi, can I help you? Hi, Mr. Quinn. We haven't met. I'm Chuck, Miss Silver's nephew, and a friend of Kelly's. Scott: Oh, nice to meet you. Yeah, she's not home right now, but she has her cell on her so you could give her a call. Thanks, Mr. Quinn. I'll do that. Oh, hello, ma'am. [grunting] [sighs] This has never happened to me before. I can't explain it. Somebody really doesn't want you to get in here. Maybe it's because of what you said at the Pluot Festival. [phone beeping] We need to talk. Grab some menus and seat yourselves. What can I get you gals to drink? Uh, three glasses of lemonade. Okay, you got it. [cell phone rings] Mom? You better get ready to rumble next Thursday night. You got the tickets? Courtside for the play off game. Awesome For all of us? Including Dad? Yes, sweetie, of course. I have to go. I'll see you tonight. Tell the girls I said hi. Will do. Bye, Mom. What did I tell you? The O'Briens are back. Three glasses of lemonade. What can I get you gals to eat? Sweet potato fries. Ooh, and a grilled cheese. And maybe a root beer float. Darbie, are you sure you're hungry? I didn't see tacos on the menu. Oh. Just the lemonade. No problem. Thank you, uh, Eleanor. Do you think anyone will notice if we eat the tacos here? I think we're safe. Okay, take us to after the Pluot Festival. The 1965 Pluot Festival. Just being safe. One, two, three. ♪ Hang on, Sloopy ♪ ♪ Sloopy, hang on ♪ What is everyone wearing? Hannah: I kind of like it. Can you believe this place was this packed? Seventy-five cents for a hamburger? At that price, I would eat 10 a day. Hey! Eleanor. We've been waiting an hour for our milkshakes. Don't blow your top. I'm new here. Is that the same Eleanor who brought us our lemonade? This day just keeps getting weirder and weirder. Over here. You didn't get my morbium seed? What do you want from me? He disappeared into thin air. What if he never comes back? We're only in this situation because you told him about the magic. He gone with my morbium seed, and now I'm the only one without one. Unless Becky used hers to spike the apple. What? Only something that powerful could have made Chuck disappear. And you were the last person to see him. I didn't do it. Prove it. I recognize that locket. Are you satisfied now? It doesn't get my seed back. Is that really all you care about? What about Chuck? This wasn't the plan. What have we done? One, two, three. I guess that solves the morbium mystery. Yeah, your grandma didn't spike the apple. But she lied to me. She said that Chuck stole her seed, but how could he have stolen it if she still had it after he disappeared? Why would Grandma Becky lie? I don't know. I have to get home. Yeah, me, too. Guitar lessons. Me, three. I'm hoping for some good news. I see your chickens have come home to roost. Don't waste my time with your folksy nonsense. Tell me what you cooked to keep me out of my pantry. Or you'll what, stare at me funny? I should have known you helped the girls lock me out of my pantry. Forget the pantry. We need to talk about Chuck. The same tune for 50 years. Not me. There's a whole big world out there, and I'm done dwelling on the past. Oh, settle down. You were in Paris for five minutes. Chuck's coming after my family. We need to keep him away from the girls, and away from magic, even if it means we have to cook. It didn't turn out so well the last time we cooked to solve the Chuck problem. I don't care what happens to Chuck. But if you find my morbium seed, don't forget who it belongs to. Look, like it or not, we started this. And we have to be on the same page about how to fix it. Oh, some things never change. You're both just as selfish as ever. You with your morbium seed, and you trying to play the noble protector card. Am I the only one who feels bad for what we did to Chuck? Mom, Dad! Whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened? It's nothin' serious. Buddy's okay. He just scraped his arm. - Does it hurt? - Buddy. Honey, what happened? Chuck saved my life. He pushed me out of the way. It wasn't that big of a deal. And it's not Buddy's fault. He was just playing on his skateboard when a car came speeding down the road. He didn't even see the little guy, but I grabbed him at the last second. Only wish I could have gotten the license plate. Wow, we're lucky you were there. - Thank you so much. - Yes, thank you. But, um, who are you? Oh, my apologies, Mrs. Quinn. My name's Chuck. I'm Miss Silver's nephew from Lavender Heights. He's really cool. Oh, okay. [chuckles] I didn't even know she had a nephew. Well, thanks again. Okay, honey, let's go clean you up. [exhales] Thanks again for bringing him back. We owe you big time. Just glad I was there. Is that a brand new turntable? Uh, it's actually really old. Forgot I had it in the attic. Huh. I got one myself. It's a beater, but it runs. I was on my way to El Pete's when I saw Buddy. Whoa. You're into old vinyl? Is there any other way to listen to music? [chuckles] There are a lot of other ways, but none as good in my mind. I hate to break it to you, but El Pete's is closed today. Oh, well, I guess I'll have to try again tomorrow. You know what? Why don't I give you a record or two from my collection. Most of 'em are collecting dust anyway. That would be cool. Thanks, Mr. Quinn. Yeah, of course. Least I can do since you were there for Buddy. "Darbs, you forgot your retainer. "Again. Love, Dad." Dad was here. Take me to the last time Dad was here. [knocking] Guess who left this in my car. Shocker. Jokes on you. Did it on purpose. You got a second? I wanted to talk to you about something. I think I know what you're gonna say. So do I. I think we've done a great job of keeping things normal for Darbie. Maybe too good of a job. She's getting the wrong idea, isn't she? Wait, what? - You noticed, too. - Yeah. Last night she kept asking when we're going on our next family vacation. I think we need to talk to her. She's needs to know this is permanent. Permanent? She also needs to know about Amy. Amy? Cubicle buddy Amy? Saffron Falls is a small town. Sooner or later, she's gonna find out. I know, Jenny. It just feels too soon. She clearly hasn't accepted the divorce. Can't believe this. So, you in Saffron Falls for the summer? Maybe longer. It all depends. Bet your parents will miss you being away that long. They're no longer with us. Oh, Chuck, I'm so sorry. Ah, it was a long time ago. I've been living with my sister, but things weren't working out, so I decided to give it a shot with my Aunt Gina. Well, I'm sure you'll like Saffron Falls. I already do. [chuckles] It's all here. Bowie, Dylan, Beatles. You name it, I purchased it at a garage sale or El Pete's. Hey, what are your thoughts on the Rolling Stones? Love 'em. They're the best. Right? It's pretty rad up here, Mr. Quinn. That's what I've been sayin'. Uh, do you have any Beach Boys? Uh, I do, somewhere around here. [grunts] It might take a little digging. I've been trying to get Kelly into them, but she says they sound too old fashioned. - That's a shame. - [muttering] Beach Boys, Beach Boys. [sighs] I keep meaning to come up and put a system in place. Uh, what kind of system? I'd like to go by decade and genre, but Terry says I should do alphabetical. And you know what? I'm beginning to agree with her. Hey, I gotta run downstairs. I'll be back in a minute. Take your time. [birds chirping] [piano playing] [sighs] Take me back to the day Gina showed Chuck the book. Gina: I shouldn't have told you about the book. If we're gonna be friends, we can't keep secrets. [sighs] Okay, but promise you won't tell anybody. Of course. You can trust me, Gina. Here it is. Just looks like a regular old cookbook to me. That's what it looks like on the outside, but inside-- The recipes are magic. [phone rings] I better get that. I'll be right back. [ringing continues] - [electricity crackling] - [gasping] You didn't think it would be that easy, did you? What's she doing here? You thought I wouldn't find it. You're no match for them. Are you sure about that? You must not trust him. He remembers. [piano playing] Chuck knows the traveler? What are you doing here? Your mom told me to let myself in if I got here early. You ready to go? Why are you pretending like everything's normal when it's not? What do you mean? Showing up here, going to play off games with Mom and me, family game night. It's all a lie. - Darbie. - Are you dating the woman I met in the park? - Amy? - [sighs] Your mom told you about it. Doesn't matter how I found out. I should have been the one to tell you - so I could explain-- - I don't want you to explain. I thought you and mom were getting back together. Oh, sweetie, I am so sorry if we gave you that impression. I want us to be a family again. Darbs, look at me. We'll always be a family. Your mom, you, me, we'll always be connected, and that won't change, no matter who your mom or I date. Everything's changed, don't pretend it hasn't. Not everything. Your mom and I love you. That will never, ever change. Okay? [sobbing] Okay. There you are. Kelly, your friend is a cool guy. Jake? Well, yeah, but I'm talking about Chuck. Wait, what? Miss Silvers' nephew. He's up in the attic looking at my records. The attic? [electricity crackling] - Get away from there. - Oh, hey, Kelly, what's up? What are you doing up here? Looking at records. Your dad's around here somewhere. Drop the act. What act? I think you have your memories back. And that means that you know about the cookbook, and more importantly, you know the traveler. Is that what she's calling herself these days? The traveler? You're smarter than they ever were. Nice hiding place. Stay away from my family, you stay away from the cookbook. Enjoy it while you have it. ♪♪
