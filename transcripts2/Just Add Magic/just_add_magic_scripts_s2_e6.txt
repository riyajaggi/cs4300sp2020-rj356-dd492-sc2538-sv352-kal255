 Previously on "Just Add Magic"... Pluots are dumb. And I'm sick of all of you. We're gonna bring this place back the old fashioned way. No more spells, Mama P. No magic. And just to be clear, we're not friends. Hannah: She's playing in public. That means her curse broke, too. Kelly: Grandma lied to me. She said that Chuck stole her seed. Why would Grandma Becky lie?

 You are the protectors of the book. It is in danger. [gasping] Look at these new symbols. What do you think it means? ♪♪ [chatter] Charles. It's been a while. Happy to see me? I know what you're up to. So? You can't stop me. Not again. This is a second chance.

 Don't make the same mistakes. The only mistake I made was not finishing the job. Give it to me. You know I can't. But this is an opportunity-- Don't bother. I will get it back. No matter what it takes. I haven't eaten in 50 years. I was hoping for a burger and shake. Please, don't make me use this. That's your bluff. We both know how much that's going to hurt you. A sacrifice I'm willing to make. Charles, stop this. Now. Not until I get what I want. Then I'm sorry. Don't! Where am I? Hey, ma'am, are you okay? Be safe. ♪♪ If these symbols are a language, it's definitely not one the internet knows. Maybe someone just got bored and doodled in the margins. That could be a spaceship. Or a puppy. No, a spaceship. Maybe we're going about this the wrong way. If the book has secrets, then we should talk to the one who knows it better than we ever could. You're talking about the traveler. The traveler for doodles in the margin? Yeah, I don't think we're supposed to call her every time we have a question. Also, I don't think she has a phone. [chuckles] But she can help us, we just have to find her. Oh, no, are we gonna have to face our fears again? Okay, facing fears again, and that's my cue to exit. I'm off to Miss Silvers' for my piano lesson. - Have fun. - Bye. I have a recipe that shows me where the traveler will appear. I've used it before to track her down. Great. Let's get cooking. No. The traveler gave this to me. I can only cook this on my own. Really? Because it feels like we should do it together. It's fine. Don't worry. Why don't you go have fun? It's summer, you know. I keep trying to tell her. Come on, Kelly, the symbols might make more sense if we took an ice cream break. Okay, maybe you're right. Let's clear our heads. Grandma. You'll let me know what the traveler says, right? Of course. Why would you even ask? No reason, I just wanted to make sure that you wouldn't forget to tell me about something important. I won't forget. Go enjoy your day. Oh, hey, Mom. Terri just got some great news. Well, it's news. Remember how I collected signatures after Buddy got hurt skateboarding? Of course. Saw the new speed bump. Nice job. Someone at City Hall noticed my activist spirit, - and decided to-- - They offered her a job as the Mayor's aid. Oh, that's great. Congratulations. Although, to be honest, I didn't vote for her. [chuckling] Ambitious. I thought we agreed on $7.50? [scoffs] Who cares. The price doesn't matter if nobody's buying. Well, they'll come eventually. I don't know, Mama P. Saffron Falls holds a grudge. I'm heading to the park to try and make some actual money. [chuckles] Go get 'em. You just need one person to take a bite of your chilled ahi-mahi sandwich, and you'll be raking in the cash. Let's hope you're right. Curling on your arpeggio still needs work. [sighs] There's so much to remember. How do you keep track of it all? Well, endless years of practice. - Can I ask you a question? - Mm-hm. Did you really play at Carnegie Hall? I did. What was it like? Electrifying. And terrifying. You were scared? Well, of course. That is why you practice. So your body can take over until the music fills the room. The fear melts, and all that's left is joy. That sounds amazing. So, why haven't you performed again? Your curse is broken. No one wants to hear me play. I've been gone for too long. That's ridiculous. You're an excellent pianist. It doesn't matter. The music world has a short memory. Miss Silvers is a prodigy. She should be playing again. She just needs someone to give her a chance. Or a new personality. What? She's a little grumpy. Jake. What's wrong? My fridge went out. That seems bad when you deliver fish. Across town. In summer. Tell me about it. - Oh, gross! - Oh, I'm gonna be sick. A whole day's worth of sales down the drain, not to mention the cash I burned on ingredients. That's terrible. It's always something with this pile of junk. The tires went flat, the heater broke, and now this fridge. - I'm sorry, Jake. - And that's not the worst of it. I have an appointment with Jess Montel to try my food tomorrow. - And she is... - Property manager at PPM. - And they are... - Pluot Property Management. They run the big office complex by the park. That could be your big break. Not with a fridge full of spoiled fish. I can't take on an account this big with this piece of junk breaking down every minute. I give up! Jake. What do you want us to do with your food bike? Put it in a dumpster for all I care. Poor Jake. It's not fair this keeps happening to him. I know. I wish we could help him. - We could. - No magic is gonna bring that fish back. No, but it might be able to bring Jake's business back. Come on. It's not his fault. He's only in this mess because Mama P stole his other bike. True. And he's not impressing anyone with his bike like this. For real. Okay. Let's do it. Maybe there's a no rust recipe. "Chicken-N-Fixits." "When anything fails, heat up your skillet, "see to the problem, then you may fix it." So this'll let us see what's wrong with Jake's bike? "Finish the job, even magic abates, "but if left incomplete, labor long with no breaks." That's ominous. I think it just means that we have to complete our task. Fix Jake's bike, and then the spell will break by itself. Seems pretty straightforward. Don't jinx it. ♪♪ Okay. Eat on three. One, two-- Hm. Not bad. I think we added too much-- Whoa. We all saw that, right? Yeah. What were those wires? They were probably connectors to the cold control thermostat. We might want to open up the fridge liner, and swap out the ends with copper tips. I have no idea how, but I totally understood that. We gonna need an 18 volt power drill with a 3/8ths bit. [chuckling] Why'd you guys call me? Because we really need you to see this. Say hello to Jake's actually deluxe deluxe food bike. This is amazing. Let me guess. Magic? Just to see what was broken. But we fixed it ourselves. We wanted to help you out. You've been working really hard. It does look a lot nicer. And check this out. Whoa. That's awesome. I can't believe you guys did this for me. You're the greatest. Really. Thanks so much. I gotta run. Jake is back in business. [chuckles] Bye. - I'm exhausted. - Me, too. Who knew fixing things was such a workout? It took all day. Summer fun tomorrow? Let's just do it before it's our winter of fun. As long as I'm up here. I should do something about that. What are you doing? These cost $200. And looked 200 years old with all those holes. They're supposed to. It's called fashion. I saw them in the laundry and I just had to fix them, because... I just had to. You would. Oh, no. I was up all night grouting the shower. I only slept two hours, and when I did, I dreamt I was repairing all the school's lockers. I thought that the magic was supposed to break once we fixed Jake's business. It doesn't look fixed to me. Jake, why aren't you at the office complex? What happened with the property manager? Remember all those terrible things Mama P said at the Pluot Festival? So does everyone else, especially Jess Montel. Once she realized I work for Mama P, I couldn't get past security. Even when I offered them free samples of my PB&J bites. Ooh, what'd you do with the free samples? I mean, I'm so sorry. That's what happens when your boss is the most hated woman in town. I'm sorry to waste all your hard work. Great. Jake's business is being ruined by Mama P's reputation. How are we supposed to fix that? We can't. We need a counter-spell. Ugh! Worst magic ever. I find it kind of calming. I think I found something. "Chill Out Chalupas." It should stop our compulsive focus on-- What are you doing? I think I'm trying to fix the book. No way. 8-5-2-9. What do you think it means? I don't know but-- Oh, the bean bag is ripping, I need to fix it. - No. - Right. Counter-spell first. Okay, the recipe says we need cedronian paprika. We don't have any. We're gonna have to go to Mama P's. [locks rattling] So you're under a fixer spell? Oh, that's a hoot. [sighs] Cedronian paprika, cedronian paprika-- It's not here. Odd. I could have sworn I had some. It's been so long since I've been in my pantry, I guess I forgot. What are we gonna do? There's no way to break this. We can't fix Jake's business until we fix your reputation. Hm, that seems to be the case. But as long as you're on this fixing kick, why not take a look at that leaky faucet. Oh, that's sneaky. [sighs] Okay, traveler. Where are you? [sighs] It's not working. [gasping] [panting] [hammering] [sanding] Uh, what are you guys doing? Helping Mama P against our wills. Hannah: It's the downside to the magic. We're trying to fix your business, but it's affected by her reputation. Don't remind me. They're in quite the pickle. Nice of them to help you out, though. We need a plan. No one trusts Mama P. They're not coming in here without a serious re-branding. Then let's do just that. New signs, new menu, it'll be a grand re-opening. I like the sound of that. We can redecorate. Balloons, streamers, a banner. I have been thinking about bringing in some live music. But nobody's going to come. Saffron Falls can hold a grudge. So I've noticed. It's true. We need something to draw people in. Easy. Give out free food. Who can resist free food? Good idea, but we also need to make sure that they come back, so... we need you to apologize. To everyone. I've got nothing to apologize for. Seriously? I said a few nasty things. But it's not my fault this town is full of crybabies. Typical. Do you want your reputation back, or is your pride gonna put us both out of a job? Fine. I'll do it. Great. Anything else? Because I think I've got the live music covered. No. The whole town would come to see you play. We need everyone we can get for Mama P's apology. Help Ida? I'd rather rot. It wouldn't just be for her. Without your help, we're stuck fixing things forever. This could be your second chance. I haven't seen a stage in decades. Stop trying to fix me. There's nothing to fix. Trust me. The only thing wrong with you is you've lost your confidence. I have plenty of confidence. That's not what I see. You should believe in yourself, Miss Silvers. I do. Becky: It's you. Where have you been? Rose. We need your help. Chuck's back. Rose. I don't understand. What does that mean? Rose. [gasping] Mama P: Look at this crowd. The store looks amazing. I should keep you girls spelled all the time. You know, you could just say thank you. Remember, Mama P, this is only gonna work if you tell everyone you're sorry. I know how to apologize. Sorry. They might be expecting a little more than that. Gina. Gracing us with your talent? I am not here for you, Ida. So? Are you gonna play? I'll have to shake off some rust, but you believed in me so maybe my time hasn't passed quite yet. Here, let me show you the piano Mr. Jensen brought you. ♪♪[Chopin Nocturne Op. 9, No. 1 in B flat minor] Miss Silvers is incredible. I knew she had it in her. And she actually looks happy. ♪♪ We've got a problem. Chuck. What do we do now? I've got this. What are you doing here? A guy can't listen to a little music? You're up to something. You think so? You need to stop looking for trouble. Or else you'll-- You've been hurt. But you can be fixed. The only thing that hurts is my arm. The way you're grabbin' it. [applause] You're as good as I remember. Good evening, everyone. Hope you're enjoying my free food. I know why you're here, so let's get this over with. I'm sorry. Pluots are a fine fruit. [sighs] Saffron Falls is a good town, and everyone here is... a person. [chatter] Dine and dash. That's nice. This isn't going very well. What do you want? For me to say everyone here is so pleasant that I didn't wake up every morning miserable? Because the truth is-- I am sorry. I was selfish. I was arrogant. And I hurt you. You might not ever be able to forgive me, but-- I hope you can give me a second chance. [applause] How do I order a batch of these peanut butter and jelly treats? Whoa. You're Jess Montel. Uh, I can get you a box of bites. They're my original recipe. You're the kid that was trying to sell food outside my office. Yeah, and I know you didn't-- I think that's a great idea. Be there tomorrow 12:30 sharp. And, uh, have plenty of these on hand. See you then. Wow, Mama P. I didn't think you had it in you. Well, I was a bit surprised myself. While I have you, the espresso machine has been on the fritz since yesterday. Actually, it seems we just fixed our problem. So I guess you're on your own. [crickets chirping] What did the traveler say, Grandma? Nothing. I only saw her in a dream. That's weird. We saw her in our dream, too. - All of you? - Yeah. She told us that we had to protect the book. Strange. With me, she-- She just looked sick. And she kept saying this one word over and over again. Rose. Really? That's it? She didn't say anything else? You don't believe me. I didn't say that, I was-- Just hoping. What do you think rose means? I don't know. But the traveler may not be able to help us. ♪♪ It was nice to have people in here again. Maybe next time they'll actually pay. Just put my PB&J bites on the menu. They were a hit. I can finish closing up, Jake. You've already done more than enough today. Great. Thanks. Hey, uh, Mama P. Thanks. For saying what you said up there. Yes, well, I meant it. I could tell. Goodnight, Mama P. Goodnight, Jake. [bell jingles] ♪♪ Hannah: Cedronian paprika, cedronian paprika-- It's not here. Well, that's odd. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm back. ♪♪
