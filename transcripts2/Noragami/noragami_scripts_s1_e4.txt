   [GIRLS laughing, shouting] [FANGIRL] Here, Lord Yato! Will you say it? Please? Ha! It is done. May our fates intertwine. [GIRLS shouting] [YATO gulping] Woo! Man, nothin' beats a cup of saké after a long day of work! All these people. You have so many worshippers, my lord! [MAIDEN] The streets are just filled with Yatoites! Hm. About time. I knew the world would catch up with me eventually. [YATO] Still, there is a certain emptiness to having your ambition fulfilled. The top is a lonely place to be. Nobody understands! How it chills my heart! [ALL] Oh, Lord Yato. I am so very cold. Won't someone come along to warm this frozen heart of mine? I will! Let me! No! Me, Lord Yato! [MAIDENS clamoring] [YATO laughing] [YATO] Hey, take it easy, now. There's plenty of Lord Yato to go around, la-- [YUKINE] Oh, just shut up! [YATO grunting] [YATO groaning] [YATO] Hooray! This looks great, thanks! Eat all you want. But in exchange, I expect you to stop dodging me and finally listen to my request! This is my favorite! Score! Are you even listening? You aren't, are you? [YUKINE yawning] I'm tired. I barely got any rest, thanks to mister talks-in-his-sleep over here. Is that a normal thing for you? Ah. that dream was something special! Please! Like there'll ever be "Yatoites." Yeah, you'll never get any followers dressing like that. No one wants to worship a slob. Especially girls. No girl would ever think that's cool. Excuse me? I mean, I wouldn't even give you so much as a handshake. You know, right? His hands are always sweaty. It's really gross! [YATO groaning] [YATO] I think it's time for me to show you what a god is capable of. [BOTH gasp] It is fated to happen. My dream will become real, and do you know why? [BOTH grunt] 'Cause I bought this baby! [BOTH] What's some old pot gonna do? It's not just any pot! I got it from a lady in town who read my palm and declared she would sell it to me and no one else! All I have to do is chant "happy-happy, cool-cool, happy-happy, cool-cool" every day while I rub it back and forth, see? [BOTH] And you believed her? And this'll make me rich if I place it on a west-facing wall. And this bracelet will help me build the home of my dreams. And this pyramid is guaranteed to boost my test scores! With all these charms, wishes I didn't even know I had will come true! I'll be happy-happy, cool-. [BOTH growling] Heads up, Hiyori! [YUKINE grunts] [HIYORI grunts] [HIYORI] Jungle Tornado! [YATO moaning] Try doing some work instead! It's not my fault things have been slow. I want to work, but I'm not getting any job calls. No calls, no work. You know, I've been thinking about what you said. How gods and Regalias are together in mind and body. [HIYORI] You were lucky to find such a great Regalia. Don't you think it's time to clean up your act a little? Pull yourself together. Yukine's counting on you now. [YATO sighs] [YATO] Get up, Hiyori. Go get your body. [HIYORI] Huh? There's somebody I want to introduce you to. [HIYORI] Uh... [birds chirping] Why'd we come here? [YATO] Kofuku! Anyone here? Hey! [YATO] Huh? [footsteps pattering] [KOFUKU squealing] [YATO grunts] [KOFUKU] Yatty! [BOTH laughing] [YATO] Hey, long time no see, huh? [YUKINE] So, who do you think she is, anyway? From the way they're greeting each other, you'd think that... No way. That'd be impossible. Guys, this is Kofuku. She's my girlfriend! Nice, huh? Yatty and I go way, way back. Nice to meet you! Girlfriend? No way! But she's a hottie! Anyway, I've got a favor to ask you, my dear. I'll do anything you want. You know that. Here's the deal. I recently made this kid into a Regalia. [YATO] Which is great, but work's kinda scarce lately, you know? Breaks my heart. I'd like to get him a hot meal in this weather. But how can I when I haven't even been able to provide shelter for him yet? I think that's the saddest story I've ever heard! Don't worry! I'll help you out. Let me see what I have here. [KOFUKU] There. Do you think this will be enough? You're a life-saver! A real sweetheart, that's what you are, baby! Aw, do you really mean it? I love it when you talk to me that way. [YATO] All right! Time to hit the pachinko parlor! [KOFUKU] I'll come with you! What a grade-A scumbag. [DAIKOKU] You dirty bastard! [YATO groaning] [YATO grunts] [DAIKOKU] What have I told you, huh? Keep your hands off my lady or I will end you! [BOTH] Whoa! It's an affair? You hear me, ya rotten, stinkin', little punk? [KOFUKU] Now! You gentlemen don't need to fight over little ol' me! I'm Kofuku Ebisu's Regalia. In weapon form the name's Koku. As a person, I'm Daikoku. [DAIKOKU sputtering] This is cool. Ebisu's a pretty big name, right? Yeah, one of the Seven Gods of Fortune. [HIYORI] Sure looks different in person, doesn't she? What are you talking about over there? [BOTH gasp] [HIYORI] Oh, nothing, really! Just about how cute of a couple you are. That's all! [DAIKOKU] Couple? Well, yeah. I mean, the two of you are married, aren't you? 'Course not. [HIYORI] Huh? But what you called Goddess Ebisu earlier... We're casual here. Kofuku's fine. [HIYORI grunts] It's just that before, you called Kofuku your lady. My lady, like a title. As in, she's my goddess. Aren't you? [KOFUKU] Mm-hmm! [DAIKOKU] I wonder what my tea leaves will say. [KOFUKU] Reading tea leaves is a bogus practice. What are you staring at? Was there something you wanted to say to me? No! No, there's nothing at all we'd like to say, sir! [YATO] Be careful. Don't look that guy in the eyes. [BOTH] Huh? Doing that can be dangerous. You might never get away. Despite his tough exterior... He has a thing for kids like you! [BOTH whimpering] Don't say it like that! You make me sound sick! [YATO yelling] [BOTH whimpering] [KOFUKU giggling] Don't get the wrong idea, okay? My Daikoku loves kids! That's all Yatty meant. Daikoku cares about children. He could do nothing but sit and watch them play all day long! You see what ya did there? Now I'm starting to sound creepy again. [DAIKOKU] Now. Let's talk, kid. [BOTH gasping] [DAIKOKU] Quit it. Don't be ridiculous. All right, boy. You're a Regalia? What's your name? Y-Yukine. [DAIKOKU] Been a Regalia long? No, sir. Not long at all. I just started, actually. Hm. I see. Young for such a responsibility. Do you think he's too young? [KOFUKU] What about you? [HIYORI] Uh, sorry? [KOFUKU] Do you have a name? Yes, I'm Hiyori Iki. Oh! I'll just call you Yori, okay? That's fine. You seem like you're just a regular human girl, Yori. What's your relationship to Yatty? [HIYORI] What? Relationship? I don't even care about the jerk. [KOFUKU] Come on, now! Why do you look so upset, huh? [KOFUKU] What's wrong? Tell me, tell me! [DAIKOKU] I'm very sorry. My lady can be crazy sometimes. [KOFUKU] You're a B-cup, aren't you? I can tell. She looks so happy like that, doesn't she? She just loves meeting new people. So anyway. Life good with Yato? [YUKINE grunting] Sounds about right. He's not much of a people person, huh? I really want to change jobs. Well, do it, then. Could I work here? My lady doesn't need anybody's help but mine. [YUKINE] Of course not! [KOFUKU] Hey, would you like some advice, Yuki? [YUKINE] "Yuki"? [KOFUKU] You should really be careful. Yatty and I are close and all, but I've heard some nasty rumors about him before. Rumors? Like what? Trust me. Despite how he might look, he's a scary god! [DAIKOKU] Oh, stop that. There's no need to frighten him. [HIYORI gasps] Time to go! I got a call for some work! Come on, Yukine! We're busy men! [HIYORI] Hey! Aren't you going to wait for me? Thanks for having us. Sorry! [KOFUKU] Aw! Leaving already? But you just got here! [DAIKOKU] Yato... What were you up to, bringing those two here? [URASAWA] Mom, I'm sorry. I hope you'll forgive me someday. [YATO] Thanks for calling the Delivery God! Yato, at your service! [URASAWA groaning] You pushed him, Yato! My bad! [URASAWA] Hey, I didn't jump... I fell? Incredible. Everything goes wrong for me. Even this. [YATO] No need to despair! Hello, sir. Are you sick of the daily grind? Depressed about your love life? Hi there, ma'am! Having trouble balancing your career and your family? What's that, kids? There are some bullies in your class that need to be taken down a notch or two? Well, good news! I can solve any problem, big or small! That's right, I'm fast and affordable! I am the Delivery God Yato. Call anytime, ladies and gen-- [BOTH screaming] [YATO] What was that for? [HIYORI] Skip the self-promotion and save him already! [YUKINE] Hand-written, huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I should introduce myself, as well. Here's my card. Or what used to be my card. Is everyone here crazy? Ah. Let me see, here. So it looks like you work at an ad agency? Or did. [URASAWA] That's right. However, the company recently went bankrupt. That's why I'm here now. I didn't know what else to do. [URASAWA] I wanted to call my parents to apologize for doing this. but I guess I accidentally dialed your number instead. [YATO] That explains the hang up, then. I mean, anyway. The hand of fate is clear in this. Start from the beginning. How did this happen? Maybe you should start by saving him! Well, I suppose it all began last winter. [HIYORI] You're doing this now? [URASAWA] I happened to come across a young woman. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. [HIYORI] Hey, why are we using my face for this? [URASAWA] You just popped into my head. I guess because you're right here. Sorry. [YATO] Stripes, huh? I wouldn't have guessed that. [HIYORI] Don't look! [YATO groaning] [URASAWA] Thinking she might be a runaway, I offered to take her to find some help. [stomach growling] You must be really hungry, huh. You want something to eat? We can take care of that. [GIRL] No, thanks. I'm not allowed to go out to eat. It's a strict rule. I'd be scared to break it. Although I do sometimes sneak out into town anyway. I can't help it. [URASAWA] The poor girl. I could tell she was living in a very controlling household. She was barely even allowed outside. Like a lovely bird trapped in a cage. [GIRL gasps] You could stand a change of pace. So where would you like to go? [GIRL laughing] [URASAWA] And that's it. That's how we first started dating. It was the happiest time of my life. [YATO] I'm gonna vomit! This guy takes advantage of vulnerable young women. Someone call the police! It wasn't like that! I cared deeply for her! I never did anything indecent, I swear on my life! I don't believe you, you perv. [URASAWA] Anyway. I came to enjoy spoiling her. [GIRL giggling] What do you think? It looks fantastic on you! [GIRL] Promise? You really don't mind buying all this for me? Well, everything looked so good on you. [URASAWA] Of course, I'm broke until I get paid again, but oh well. [GIRL] Thank you so much, Yusuke! I love you! Yep, gonna puke. Stop picturing me. It's creepy! How long have we been falling now? [URASAWA] Wait. This is for me? [GIRL] Just a little present. [URASAWA] Oh, do you like Capypas? They're my favorite! I've never been to Capypa land, though. It's called the "Kingdom of Dreams and Hopes," so of course I'm not allowed to go. [URASAWA sobbing] What a sad life! I'll take you! We'll see it together. You mean it? [URASAWA] It was around then that things started to go wrong. I don't know how else to explain it. [KIDS sobbing] [MOTHER] It's okay, boys. [URASAWA] Huh? [MAN panting] [YATO shouting] What's with that place? Middle-aged men walking around wearing Capypa skins? That's twisted and  jus-just plain wrong! [URASAWA] They're just suits, it's okay! Here, you see, there's a Capypa fairy coming along to make everything all better! [HIYORI] Enough with this stuff already! [URASAWA] I don't know what happened. but we started to run into all sorts of bad luck. As things got worse, my job performance steadily dropped. I never got bonuses anymore, and my meager savings dried up almost before I knew it. But I just couldn't imagine not being with her anymore. [URASAWA] I was desperate. [phone vibrating] [REPO MAN] I know you're in there! [URASAWA] One thing led to another and I went bankrupt. I just wanted to be with her. but with the hole I had dug for myself, I knew I would only become a burden. I wanted to spend our lives together. I had been planning to propose to her. Not now! I don't deserve her anymore! [YATO] Hey, uh. You got a pic of this girl I could take a look at? A picture? There's something familiar about this story. [URASAWA] Here she is. [HIYORI] That's Kofuku! [URASAWA] Huh? How do you know her name? Shoulda guessed it sooner. What? Why? How could you possibly know? Guess I didn't tell you everything earlier. Kofuku is the god of poverty. [BOTH] Huh? The god of poverty? Well, she doesn't go by her title most of the time, and I can't say that I blame her, really. It's not exactly the kind of thing that makes you popular. Take my advice on this one, man. Forget about that girl. Seriously. Ditch her. Huh? [YATO] The god of poverty only brings disaster. Spend time with her and you're basically asking to have your life ruined. Oh, and there's one more thing. She has a guy in her life you don't want to cross. [URASAWA sputtering] And if it helps at all, she's not nearly as young as she looks. We're talkin' way older than your grandma. Way older than your grandma's, grandma's, grandma, for that matter. [URASAWA groans] All right, then! We'll sever your ties to her and then you'll be good. [URASAWA] Huh? Sever his ties to her? But doesn't that mean. He'll forget everything having to do with Kofuku. I don't want to forget her, though! No, I refuse! You can't make me agree to this, can you? I strongly recommend you do this. If you don't, you'll die very soon. Well, I'll die then! You don't understand! I love her with my whole heart! How stupid are you? [URASAWA grunting] [YATO] Someone who would end his own life like this doesn't know a damn thing about love! [URASAWA gasps] [HIYORI] Think we could hurry this up, please? It just keeps getting more and more insane. [YATO] All right! Yukine! You're up, kid. Huh? [YUKINE] Wait! Hold on! I've never severed anyone's ties before. It'll be fine, don't worry. I know you can do it. Have a little faith, okay? [YATO] Come, Sekki! [YATO] Anything you want me to tell Kofuku? Just this, please. "I wish you the best. Have a happy life." Very well. I've heard your wish loud and clear. Hear me. I am the god Yato. I hereby sever ties. Sekki! Sunder! Uh-Huh? [KOFUKU] Oh, wow! Are you serious? He was really going to do that just because of me? I mean, it's not like I was trying to hurt him. I wanted to have a little fun, that's all! [ALL] A little fun? [DAIKOKU sobbing] I'm hurt, Kofuku! I can't believe you would do that behind my back! It's your own fault, you know. I was so sick of you always telling me where I couldn't go and what I couldn't do. [DAIKOKU] Well, somebody has to! Or else you'll spread disaster everywhere! [DAIKOKU sighing] I'm too old for this. Well, anyway, you got skills, kid. Severing ties while you're still a rookie! Oh. I didn't realize it was a big deal. Well, it is. Severing a bond is much more difficult than making one. And a Regalia's abilities play a big part in how well it works, too. [YUKINE gasps] It was so easy. I'm really surprised to hear that. [DAIKOKU chuckling] That's the right attitude! Yato! Looks like you found yourself a good Regalia. Yeah, I know. When I picked him, I had a feeling he was more than a pretty face. Isn't that right, Yukine? Get off 'a me! Stop, you freak! [YATO] Aw, no need to be bashful! [YUKINE] Quit it! Leave me alone, sweaty hands! Sorry about all this. Thanks a lot for cleaning up Kofuku's mess. It was my pleasure! Later! [KOFUKU muffled] Bye for now! I hope you come back and visit, Yori! Sure! And, um, about what you said earlier. [KOFUKU] Hmm? When you said Yato was a scary god. That was all just a joke, right? Oh, no. It's true. [KOFUKU] It was a long time ago, but Yatty did kill a Regalia once. Before I met him, I'd only ever heard rumors. And they weren't exactly very nice ones. [KOFUKU] I mean, you gotta keep in mind Yatty is a god of war. He kills people, too, sometimes. [HIYORI] He kills... people? [DAIKOKU] Quit it. That was a long time ago. Things were different then, you know? It was basically kill or be killed. Sorry, I don't understand. What are you talking about? The way things work for a god. People's wishes are what give gods the ability to exist. [DAIKOKU] Powerful gods enjoy constant worship and wishes. That isn't true for the obscure gods, though. They have a hard enough time even being remembered. So, what do you do to keep from being forgotten? You grant any wish that comes your way. No matter what it is. No matter who it came from. [HIYORI] Whatever it is? Really? [YATO] You were there a long time. What were you chatting about? [HIYORI] Yato. Why did you bring me to meet Kofuku? I know you had a reason. [YATO] Listen. If anything happens to me. I want you to go straight to those two. Do you understand? Yeah. Got it! [HIYORI] Oh, wow. Why does he smell so nice? [water drips] [YATO] When I picked him, I had a feeling he was more than a pretty face. [YUKINE gasps] [NORA] Hi. You know, you have really pretty eyes. [YATO] That's enough, Nora. What do you want? [NORA] For starters, you could call me by my name. Please, Yato. It isn't so much to ask, is it? I love that name. [HIYORI] Wait, is this girl... Is she a Regalia of yours, too? [YUKINE gasps] Remember, whenever you need me, I'll be waiting. [water drips] [NORA] Just waiting for you to call my name. That's all you have to do. [YATO] Say "Yato" ten times, really fast. [KOFUKU] Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato! [YATO] Now, who's the coolest guy ever? [KOFUKU] Daikoku! [YATO] Who's the best god in the world? [KOFUKU] Kofuku! [YATO] Tch! [KOFUKU] Next time on Noragami: "Borderline."
