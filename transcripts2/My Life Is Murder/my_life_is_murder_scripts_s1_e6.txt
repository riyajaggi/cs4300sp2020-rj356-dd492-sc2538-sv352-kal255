 No, I already had dinner. Pizza. How's the pizza in Napoli? Oh, really? OK. Hey, Massi, where are you? OK, Massi, one more time. No, it's not late. Police call this a cold case. On May 30 last year, a young man was found dead in Melbourne, Australia. The voice you're about to hear is Detective Inspector Kieran Hussey

 two weeks after Zac Morgan was bashed and left to die in an alley. Today, we're asking the media to help us and to encourage the public to come forward with any information that will help us find who committed this crime. A year later, Zac Morgan's murder remains unsolved. This is his story. What evidence have the police missed? Who was the podcaster? Anonymous. - Have you traced him? - I'm working on it. Podcast only went up last night. Ah, well, first of many. You know, getting on, get sponsored, get rich.

 I think that's the way it's supposed to go. The media units all love me like a fat kid on a cupcake. Got any leads? Nothing new. What about the old ones? Yeah, a couple. Victim's name was Zac Morgan. He was his brother's best man, smart, funny, loved by his family. There comes a day in every man's life where he finds his soul mate... ...and has to get a proper haircut. On the day of the wedding, everything was going smoothly, bride and groom happy, Zac made a great speech. Then his boyfriend showed up, uninvited, off his face, made a stir. Why wasn't the boyfriend invited? Groom didn't like him, and the rest of the family didn't know Zac was gay. Oh, until the boyfriend showed up. - Oh, he made sure everyone knew. - Woo! Went to town on Zac, the bride, groom, everyone... You're all arseholes! ...pushed Zac out of the closet with a bulldozer, in front of his family. Oh, yeah, yeah, here we go. Zac and his boyfriend fought. Zac! Then they took off. The neighbour said they were still fighting in their house when they got home. An hour later, Zac was dead in the alley behind their house. Hit in the head with some kind of with weapon, we think. But it was actually the fall that killed him, subdural haematoma. Ugh. Who found him? The same neighbour who heard the fight. The body was still warm. So I'm guessing the boyfriend had a good story. Well, he said he went for a walk. He can't remember where. Oh, that's a crap story. We can't place him at the crime scene. Oh, yet. Alright. Come on, show me what you've got. I know you brought something. How's the insomnia going? Oh, it's going like a train. Go to the doctor, get some sleeping-pills. No. I don't like those things. They're addictive. Just take one. It might help you to break the cycle. Do you know what? I don't think my bloody doctor would give me any. Just tell him you're going on a long-haul flight somewhere. It's hard to sleep on those seats. Are you telling me to lie to my doctor, Kieran? Why is he so special? OK, this is weird. The head wound looks like a cult symbol. What is it? Don't know. Huh. You wanna get that? No, it's OK. Kieran, it's Pippa. Take the call. It's just about the kids. I've got them on the weekend. How are your kids? Yeah, they're great. Keep me bloody sane. Thank you for this. Sure. Did you listen to the podcast? Yeah, I did. I want you to track down that podcaster. So we're doing this one? I love it. If this podcaster guy has got some new evidence, I want to know what it is. Oh, and what about some background on Zac Morgan's boyfriend, what's his name? - Uh, Tony Ryles. - Yeah. Hey, I sent you some crime scene photos. - Got them up? - Uh, yep. There's a mark on the dead guy's forehead. What is it? It looks like a cross with a circle around it. No. I mean what does it mean. Oh, that's not what you said. Hey, Sam. Hi. Alexa Crowe. Thanks for making time, hey. Podcast just said that there was new evidence. I was hoping you could tell me what that would be. Well, if I knew, I wouldn't give it to a podcaster. Yeah. Well, if he contacts you, can you call me? Sure. That's my number. This is going to go on and on, isn't it? The investigation. It's a murder. It won't be closed until it's solved. That's what you want, isn't it? Mmm. Tell me about your brother. He was funny... ...trusting, too trusting. He trusted you to keep his secret that he was gay. Well, I never wanted that secret. I pleaded with him to come out. He needed to live his life properly, not in hiding. The only thing he didn't trust... ...was how much we all loved him. - Are you OK? - No. I walk around reliving it... ...the inquest, the photos, the effect on my family, and now you. I need to move on and I can't. Yeah, I know how that feels. I have to go. Sam, what do you think happened to your brother? I think Tony killed him. Everything OK? Yeah. Here. This will cheer you up. The boyfriend, Tony Ryles, had online relationships while he was with Zac Morgan. Yes. I think that's here in the case file. Yeah, but one sticks out. This guy, Andre. They met on a dating site. Tony's last conversation with him happened the day before Zac died. Thing is Andre never spoke to anyone else, only Tony Ryles. - Curiouser and curiouser. - Yeah, it's weird, right? I mean, you know what internet dating's like. No. Oh, you should really give it a try. Well, your advice is noted. Now, tell me what you mean. Well, I mean it can be pretty good when it works out. No, I mean tell you what you mean in terms of its relevance to this case. Oh, right. Well, um... ...as a general rule, internet dating's about meeting as many people as possible, right? You know, keeping your options open. But Andre only ever had eyes for one option, Tony. Oh, I want a hard copy of a photo of that guy. Oh, it's in the cloud. I don't want it in the cloud. I want it in my hand. Yeah, but if it's in the cloud, then you can just look it up on your phone. Madison, there is no cloud. It is just a fluffy name for a bunch of warehouses full of hardware, which you can hack. I do like real clouds, however, 'cause they're nice. Did you find our podcaster? Yeah, I'm still trying. I'll get back to it tomorrow. What's wrong with today? What? Apart from the fact that it's almost midnight? I have to do that back at the office. Well... You're doing a selfie now? Got to remember life's important moments, even if it's the moment you realise you have no life. Smile! Tony, is it? Hi. I wonder if I can talk to you about Zac. I'm investigating what happened to him. I used to be a cop, can't help it. Alexa Crowe. I just want to talk. Promise. No handcuffs, no badge. It's just that your name was mentioned on the, um... - Podcast. Yeah. - Podcast, yeah. At least 30 people sent me the link. That's why you're here, isn't it? Well, I read your statement. You said you thought it was a hate crime. Yeah. Wouldn't be the first time. You mean the first time that Zac was threatened, or what? No. It wouldn't be the first time someone's been killed because they're gay. - May I? - Yeah. Oh, Zac has a kind face. That was the, um... That was the day he asked me to marry him. I remember that feeling. He never told his family, though. Pack of pricks. I didn't do it. For the hundredth time. I loved him and he loved me. Did you ever think about moving? Why should I? It's my house. Walk with me. So how long did you walk that night? That night is a blur. Yeah, I walk alone at night when I can't sleep. But if you felt threatened before, then... I was pissed. Seriously. And Zac and I were fighting. You did that a lot? Yeah, we also made up a lot too. So... What did you fight about? The wedding. I only found out about it 'cause it was on his brother's Facebook page. I just, um... ...hated the fact that he was so... ashamed of... ...me, of us. Maybe he thought he was protecting everyone. In the end, he couldn't even protect himself. Hey, tell me what you do remember. Look, I, uh, I crashed the wedding. Wasn't my finest hour. Um... You know... ...Zac and I argued... ...but it's all pretty hazy. You think I'm lying. If you could recall where you walked to, - that would really help. - I've tried. Tell me about Andre. - Who? - The guy you met online. Andre. Katherine Stoddard lives adjacent to the house that Zac Morgan shared with Tony Ryles. Just half an hour before she found Zac's dead body, Katherine heard the men arguing aggressively inside their house. She testified at the coronial inquest that these fights were a regular occurrence, that they'd become increasingly violent, and that she found them frightening. Did this last fight lead to Zac Morgan's death? Only Zac Morgan's boyfriend, Tony Ryles, knows the truth. You want the good news or the bad news? You choose. I can't find the podcaster. You mean you haven't yet found the podcaster. He's using a virtual private network, working via an encrypted tunnel routed through a server somewhere in America or Uzbekistan. - Meaning? - He doesn't want to be found. Doesn't want to, or can't, be found? - Both. - Bugger. Excuse me? Sorry. OK, what's the good news? I'm eating the best cake I've ever had in my life! Cake for lunch. That's nutritious. Well, I need the sugar hit. What about old mate, Andre? Oh, nothing yet. I thought you were supposed to be good at this stuff? I am. I'm the best. It still takes time. Where'd you find the cake, then? There's a fantastic new place. Oh, hang on. Another episode of the podcast went up. OK, I'll send you the link and I promise to avoid the cloud. Oh, sorry. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. - Manson, stop that! - Look over there! - Alexa? - Yes. Yes. Coming. Sorry. You're listening to Unsolved: Justice For Zac. This is episode 2. - In this episode... - How much sleep are you getting? Oh, it varies. Three or four hours... - ...the wedding where 36 people... - ..on average. ...witnessed Tony Ryles violently abuse Zac Morgan. Now, last time, we heard how Zac Morgan and Tony Ryles were heard fighting violently... Oh, sorry. I just... Do you think you're trying to do too many things at once? No. Look, I just need some sleeping-pills. When you can't sleep, are you looking at screens? Phone? TV? Computer? No. God, no. Absolutely not 'cause that would make it worse, right? Right. You're still exercising? Yeah. I mean, again, with the exercising. Yes. - How much? - Heaps. Look, if you could just see a way to giving me some sleeping-pills, I think... In many cases, insomnia is a symptom, rather than an actual... And in other cases, it's just the way things are, yeah? Did I tell you I'm going on a plane, long-haul? Did I say that? - Nice. - Mm. - Where to? - France. Very hard to sleep in those seats. Mmm. When are you going? Soon. Next Friday. What for? For cheese. What does anybody do in France? Cheese and castles. No wine? You should have been a cop, you know that? Alexa, would you like to speak to a counsellor? You're not going to give me the pills, are you? I think you've had enough of those as well. This is Madison Feliciano. Leave a message. I think that podcaster was at the wedding, so look up the guest list and find out who's been looking up virtual private tunnels or whatever the hell they're called. I'm going to go speak to the bride and see if she knows anything. Call me when you have time. Hi. I'm Alexa. Sam will be home soon. Oh, no problem. Have you heard the second podcast? Yeah, it's very painful to listen to, but I'm pleased if it's making something happen. Oh, I'll get that. Ta. I'm so over this. When are you due? Uh, soon. I can't wait. - It's hard work, you know? - No. Oh, sorry. Don't be. So, how did Sam's family react when they learned Zac was gay? Stunned. Angry? No, Zac was killed before they had a chance to be anything much. Did any of them go to the inquest? Just Sam and me. Why? Routine question. Zac's family loved him. It was Tony that did this awful thing. You should be talking to him. He's the killer. I'm just trying to find evidence to prove that. ..and secondly, organising this wedding has taken at least three years of my life. And thirdly, I don't iron clothes! And with that bombshell, um, Sam's brother, Zac. Thanks, Cara. Great best man I am. Forgot the rings, sorry. I promise you'll get them back. Anyway, there comes a day in every man's life where he meets his soul mate... ...and has to get a proper haircut. Obviously, Sam hasn't reached that point yet. Oh, Zacky! Woo! Let's hear it for Zac, ladies and gentlemen, my boyfriend. Been living with him for two years! I still couldn't get an invite because you're all arseholes. Hey, come on, mate. Calm down. I'll make you a copy. Sorry. I can't watch it. No. I understand. Who's this guy, grabbing Tony? That's my cousin, Gilbert. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi, darling. - Hi, doll. - Good to see you again. - You too. Alexa's asked to see our wedding video. Any developments? Well, small ones. You know, that's usually how it goes. Did you guys get the rings back? I asked Tony to find them, but he never did. I've got some more shopping in the car. Are you right, love? Yeah, good. Those rings. They were hand-crafted. White gold. Ask Tony how much he got for them. I would love to know. I'll get a flash drive. - Who's wedding? - Oh, just a friend. ...organising this wedding has taken at least three years of my life... Looks like a happy day. Till it wasn't. And, um... Oh, here's trouble! Hey, Mike and Dom. You're about 300 years older than the last time I saw you. - Say, "Hi, Alexa." - Hi, Alexa! Give me your donut! You want to walk or... Er... George-ous? Yes? Want to show the kids a VIP tour of the kitchen? Sure. You want to see me put meat through a grinder? - Yeah! - Oh, yeah! - Let's go, come on. - Thanks, mate. So, still riding you? I have got a full briefing with the deputy commissioner and the media unit 8am tomorrow. - Sunday? - Mm-hm. Wow. Have you got anything I can tell them? Well, Tony Ryles didn't do it. I mean, for starters, he's got a photo of Zac pride of place in his house, who does that after a crime of passion? No-one. Unless he's a crook, which he's not. Secondly, the neighbour said she heard a fight inside the house. It's just not possible. The windows are double-glazed and on May 30th last year, it was 8 degrees, the windows would all be closed. So I think that what she heard was fight outside, not inside. Maybe they didn't go inside. No, they did. The case file tells us that Zac took off his tie, which was left inside, and we know that Tony Ryles changed his shirt, and the lights were all on. Why would they go outside to fight in a dark alley? So I think the neighbour heard a fight between Zac and someone else. Hate crime? Yeah, or the online lover, someone at the wedding. I mean, a lot of conservative people there, secretive. It's Madison. - Hello? - OK. I've got a few things for you. First off, Andre doesn't actually exist. Then how come we've got a picture of him? It's a public domain shot taken 13 years ago by some Canadian portrait photographer who's now dead. - That's weird. - Oh, it gets weirder. Whoever posted Andre's online dating profile did it at the State Library. Oh, someone's catfishing. Yeah. Oh, and I looked into the metadata on all 30 guests and the wedding party. None of them have been looking for virtual private networks, so that's a dead end. OK. What about the symbol on his forehead? It's a sun cross. It represents the four elements. Unless you break the circle and then it's a swastika. OK. Hey, are you at work? Yeah. Alright. Well, I appreciate it. Oh, for you, always. She's at the beach. - Lucky for her. - Yeah. Look! Dad! Mince! Ow, wow, mince meat. Did you make that yourself? You're listening to UNSOLVED: Justice For Zac. This is episode 2. In this episode, we are going to go back to the wedding, the wedding where 36 people witnessed Tony Ryles violently abuse Zac Morgan. Now, last time, we heard how Zac Morgan and Tony Ryles were heard fighting violently in their house just half an hour before Zac's body was found, and we know that the police didn't located Tony Ryles... ..where 36 people witnessed Tony Ryles violently abuse Zac Morgan. Now, last time, we heard how Zac Morgan and Tony Ryles were heard fighting... How's it going? I need you to do something for me urgently. - Look, I just... - At the beach? I know. Have you got voice-match software at the office? And can you work out if a recorded voice has been altered? Yeah. Great. I need you to go right away. 36 people witnessed Tony Ryles violently abuse Zac Morgan. Darling? What do you feel like for dinner? Sam? And now for the icing. Make sure your cake is cold... Ooh, that looks good. Mm. Have you listened? Yeah. I didn't want to. Try to spread it evenly at the top and let it run down the sides... I kind of had to. Are you alright? Yeah. ...and then use your knife or spatula... Are you hungry? Um, yeah. We need something for dinner. But you know what I really feel like? A Mars bar and a jar of anchovies. I think we're just out of those. Well, if you go get them from the shop, I would love you more than I do now, which is... ...a very great deal. ...and there you have it, my favourite gluten-free, dairy-free... ...perfect chocolate cake. Make sure you hide it from the kids or there'll be nothing left to eat. Hi. Sam's just gone out. In this episode, we are going to go back to the wedding, the wedding where 36 people witnessed Tony Ryles violently abused Zac Morgan. That's your voice. You altered it to sound like a man. Tell me why. Before Zac died, Sam was full of life. He used to laugh, like, all the time, and Tony took that away from us. ...from me. I mean, it was... It was so obvious to every man and his dog that Tony was guilty and the police just seemed to stop looking. I was pleased when you turned up, because the podcast did exactly what I'd hoped it would do. You did a good job disguising your voice. I'm a software engineer. It wasn't hard. How'd you know? Well, in the podcast you said there were 36 guests. The guest list said only 34. And you were the one that organised the wedding. You were the only one who could have known there were two late additions. Please don't tell Sam. Why the secrecy? The idea of having a kid has given Sam something big to look forward to. I mean, he's not the man that he used to be, and maybe he never will be, but he smiles now occasionally, so... If he found out that I did the podcast, it just would mess everything up. If Zac's boyfriend, Tony, finds out it's you on the podcast, he can sue you. - I'd like to see him try. - You might not. I think he's innocent. They were fighting. Tony was violent. Everyone saw it. It had to be him. I don't think so. - He was having an affair. - How do you know that? Tell me what you know about Andre. Maybe somewhere along the line we both lost our senses of humour. And Pip agrees, ask her. She says I'm married to the cops, which is ridiculous. I mean, yes, I'm busy but it's not like... Sorry, can I put you on hold for a sec? Yeah, sure. Yeah? Zac Morgan's sister-in-law was the podcaster. She did it to stir the pot. Smart woman. Sister-in-law? It was a man? Cara Morgan is a software engineer, made it sound that way. But get this, Zac's brother, Sam, was catfishing Tony Ryles. See, according to Cara, Sam set up a fake online dating profile under the name Andre as bait just to prove that Tony Ryles was a dickbag. - So who killed Zac Morgan? - To be confirmed. But hate crime is looking better and better. OK, can you write this down for me? Yeah. Sounds like you're in a hurry. Yeah, I'm just in a phone marriage counselling session. - What? Now? - Yeah. Kieran, why would you take my call in the middle of that? Well, it's important. Prioritise. - Are you still there? - Yes, I am. The idea that I don't make time for my family is simply not true. I'm playing with my kids right now. Oh, for God's sake! This is Madison Feliciano. Leave a message. Mads. Hey, listen, I've been thinking about that symbol. Maybe it's a hate group insignia. Something to do with a cult. I haven't been able to find anything about it, but maybe you can. And check all the wedding guests. Make sure there's no links to hate groups. Or maybe... maybe it was a random attack. Yeah, I mean, there's no history of police reports of unreported attacks in the area, but it could have gone unreport... Madison, a man showed up at my house this morning and delivered a box of your special cakes. - Was I right? How good are they? - They're unbelievable. That was a very kind thing for you to do. Oh, you know how it is. Once you find something that good, you have to get your friends on the same train. Anyway, I looked into the sun cross. Local hate groups tend to go for other kinds of symbols. - There are vaguely similar ones but... - Oh, yikes. Uh, hang on a sec. - You right there? - Yep. Not as right as I was 10 seconds ago, but, um... please go on. Hey, I saw Kieran downstairs with the suits. He wasn't wearing his wedding ring. - Have you noticed that? - Not our business, lady. The rings! - What rings? - The wedding rings. Sorry? Madison, contact all the custom jewellers in the city and ask them if last year they made a wedding ring with that symbol on it. Thank you. Hi, Cara. - Is Sam home? - Uh, no. He's working in Bendigo today. Did you find something? What's happened? Did he find out about the podcast? Cara, did you ever see the rings that Sam had made? I told you, we never got them back. Yeah, but did you ever see them? No. They were meant to be a surprise. Why? At any time on your wedding night, were you and Sam apart? No. We came home and went straight to bed. Huh. So when the police rang to tell you what had happened to Zac, you were here, both of you? Yes! What are you talking about? Oh! Oh. Oh, shit. Uh... OK. Um... Uh... It's alright. You are going to be 100% fine and dandy. Maybe an ambulance. This will be faster. Promise. You've called Sam Morgan. Please leave a message. Thanks for calling. Um, I'm on my way to the hospital now. Just meet us there. I know it's early days, but I really want you there right now. We're having the baby. Oh, hey, safety first. Seatbelt on, missy. - Here, give me that. - Can you just get us there alive? Yeah, yeah. I used to do pursuits. - Yeah, I can tell you enjoyed it. - A little too much. It cost me my licence when I became a civilian. - You lost your licence? - St Vincent's? Oh! Yeah. - Ah... - Good, give me your hand. By the end of today, you're going to have a lovely little baby. Oh. Hey, mate. Park it in back, would you? Wheelchair! Excuse me, excuse me, this woman's in labour. How far apart are your contractions? Um, two minutes, and I'm booked under my husband's name, Morgan. Morgan, yeah. OK. God, I am so sorry... Where's Cara? She's taking a shower. She's fine. Everything's fine. You have a beautiful son. Congratulations. Sam, I know what happened to Zac. I know it was you. Please. Don't do this now. I'll be outside. Sam, you let Tony take the blame, but you need to face up to what you did. Otherwise, this is just going to eat you up. You've got to give yourself and your family a chance at true happiness. I went to Zac's house... ...when Cara was asleep... ...to get the rings. Just take them, alright, and go. - I want you to go. - I'm not going to go... Yeah, and to tell your brother that Tony was cheating on him... - Please, just leave right now. - OK... ...which you knew, 'cause you catfished him with a fake dating profile. Just listen to me! Did Zac leave the house looking for Tony and you followed him? What? You want me to thank you for trapping him? I fucking hate you! Hey. I mean, I believe that you loved your brother and you thought you were doing the right thing - stopping him seeing Tony... - Zac! ...you were hurt that he chose Tony over you. You thought he was going to be OK. But when you left, he collapsed and died. Hey. You know, if you'd just thrown those rings away and not melted them down, we probably wouldn't be here now. There's part of me... ...that's glad we are. Yeah. 'Cause it was an accident, right? So own it. Hey. He'll need a few minutes. Go easy on him. You around later for a drink? Next time. I need to sleep. Oh, my goodness. Would you go home? Evidently, that's where the heart is. Massimo, let's kill some bad guys!
