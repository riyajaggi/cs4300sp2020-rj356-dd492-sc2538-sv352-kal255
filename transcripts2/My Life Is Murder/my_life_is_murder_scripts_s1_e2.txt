Left arm outside  the right stuck, more outside. Fold this leg.  Head to the left. No, your other left. It's like playing 'twister'  after drinking too much wine. Alan Patrick Gillespie  left the shower, He brushed his teeth  and stopped to look in the mirror when  he was shot from behind, probably a redheaded woman, but it is a bullet caliber,  so did not fall forward, he went back and fell there. And you try to get clues  about the position of the body? No, I just want to take your  middle while I think. He was naked with only a towel  and brushing your teeth. Do you do that with someone  you do not know well or with whom you are not very comfortable? A long-time affair. Yes maybe. Or a jealous wife. Except that the bed was made. 58 percent of homicides  household are by sexual jealousy. It is true? More than a half? It is actually 58.7 percent. Forget the statistics,  what do your instincts say? I want to eat, I'm thinking  in tomato soup. Get me all the details  about Alan Patrick Gillespie. Murder and did. Get me something they do not. I'm targeting this weekend. God, people still do that? Well, begins tonight. I'm going to see Ed Sheeran. He looks like somebody's grandfather. I do not want to miss the entrance. Okay, I'll stay. Do not frown, Miss. Alan told you he was traveling  to see his sister in Hobart, but actually it was  40 minutes in a hotel room. With a redhead, apparently. Yet in your statement in June,  you said he never cheated. Yes. Just a regular guy. Or so I thought. I was obviously wrong. How was your sex life? Well. Normal. Once a week, usually. Are you trying to trick me to confess? I did not kill my husband, I did not hire someone else  to murder him. For the love of God, how you would  find a hired murderer? I am a midwife. Carmel, I wish you  had an alibi. Well, what I can say? I was here with my son, sleeping. He lost his father. Sorry for your loss. Really. ... That picture is different. It's horrible, I know. It was a gift from a homeless  near the office of Alan. Alan helped him recover. So I was proud of that? Alan knew it was horrible,  but it was important to him. He said it was a picture of his spirit. Alan Patrick Gillespie,  state banking, pension, credit card phone payments,  last two tax years, employment history in  Production Seraphim and a gym membership, defeated. And how was it? By the way. - ¿Alan?  - Ed Sheeran. Fantastic, you should see it. Hey, what do they do in Seraphim? Components for manufacturers  of Asian vehicles. A private corporation, must have a record  of actions somewhere. Did you just do that? Yes. Y? Give me the share register. Well, what's your  humble opinion, Madison? - What, Ed?  - No, Alan. It was normal. - Common Super.  - Seriously? Without hidden debts?  Without gambling problems? No, financially conservative. He survived with just  a credit card. I listen that can happen! The common super Alan Patrick Gillespie  had no problems with alcohol or drugs. No, no vices, a record  medical impeccable. Wait, Nicole Butcher. Who is she? The alias of a criminal I knew. Account. Nikki Malone, you hear about it? No. The last time I saw her was handcuffed. Is redhead? No. You're good? Yeah, rain is forecast? I don `t believe. Cursed Kieran,  that manipulative bastard. I cheated again. That sounded good, great. Very well. - Yes, except for you.  - What? Yeah, where were you in the chorus? Just kidding! Just kidding. I love you mama. Remember that when you're on tour. Well, look who it is. How are you, Nikki? So long. I never noticed wicked guitarist  on your resume. I'm just an impromptu. But Cassie singing itself. Yes, we are nothing to sign  a contract in the UK. Congratulations. Thank you. Although it spent  a fortune in the process. - Do you want a drink?  - Yes, it would be fine. Hey, he did here, no?  When did we last saw? No, in the county court.  Traffic in quantity, gobbledygook. I correct myself. And you thought you caught me, gobbledygook. I have no idea  how you got rid of that. Well, I congratulated the jury  for its application. So... I heard you left the police. Yes, many refuse  to jury verdicts. Cunning. I heard you encaminaste  after your husband died. Alexa, he is Anton. My financial advisor. - Hello.  - How is it going? You can teach all taxes,  show that we are legal. Yes, it would be fine. So... Alan Gillespie. Contador, who was killed last June. You left the police, right? Well, I'm also an impromptu. A Alan was shot  the night of June 22 and I wondered where were you? No idea, it was months ago. You want to check? Anton, on June 22 night,  what were you doing? What is this? Alan Gillespie worked  in Production Seraphim and I noticed that bought  much of that company. Why you not buy  shares with your name? I bought those shares for years. Before you come back  Nikki Malone? Yes something like that. On June 22 you were at  the beach house with Cass. A luxury. How's life treating you on track? It feels great. Do you get up every morning,  you check the New York Stock Exchange? Do not be silly, I check the  London Stock Exchange first. - How are you?  - great. Well, good to see you, Nikki. Do not stay. Beer ends. No, I have to go home  and put rock, you inspired me. Hey, Mom, just ... Sorry. I was not going. Will you give me cash? How much? As about 100. We wanted to order sushi. Nice hair. Goodnight. Here you go, honey. I heard that you are now  fan of Ed Sheeran. Yes, great. Yes, it's like Jamie Oliver  with tattoos on his arms. Just because the daughter of  Nikki Malone is redhead, You think sleeping with the victim? Perhaps, or Nikki thought he did. Do you risk a  life sentence for that? It's possible. Cass is the apple of his eye, it  really is all that Nikki has. It sounds a bit like you're letting  the past cloud your judgment. Tautology, the past  and history, is the same Thank you. - Thank you.  - Enjoy it. It is commitment, I consume. Please come back to caffeine,  for our sake. You know what? Is right. Do not fight. I'll get you another coffee. Thank you. It does not seem to have much. Well, press, let him go dogs. I can not give you watch  unless you give me something. Nikki Malone kept  his nose clean for five years. People like her does not change. It is not why I got into this? If someone will take  their dirty laundry, it 's you. You really are a fox,  I did not know this side of you. At least I do not go around  correcting people's grammar. A hunch is not. Do you have a plan B? Daughter get DNA  to match the lipstick. Without an order?  Luckily I did not hear that. Luckily I did not say. Tell me how Nikki Malone  left the hotel room and put the string on the door later. I'm working on it, do not rush me. I'll wait another coffee. Cassie has talent. I heard a demo of your song, it's good. See if you can connect  to Alan Gillespie. It is understood. And needless to say, I want a full reading  of Nikki Malone. You said it anyway.  I have a tray full of work here. And his friend. Anton something,  while you're at it. Anton something. Yes, ask in taxes.  He will be in the form of Nikki. And I want a complete profile  on Production Seraphim. Sorry, you will cut. I want a complete profile ... I'm sorry, are you there?

Where were you on June 22  last year? - Why?  - I only ask. I'm sorry, I do not want to bother you. No no. It's okay. When he said? On June 22. He was at the beach house  working on a song. Yes, you need a lot of time  alone for that, right? I was with my mom. Well, thank you, Cassie. You have been very helpful. Do not you hate when you close  with the key inside? Ensure. Now you're safe and sound. ¡Váyase! Bye! Ensure. Shit. Hey, what happened to the lip gloss? The laboratory does.  They require 12 hours to analyze DNA. - Maybe 15 hours.  - So... Anton's name is Whiteley. Well, it was not so hard, right? It formed as paramilitary training in surveillance,  arms intelligence. The things you find, Madison! And, you'll love this, Did you see the cameras of the hotel were  not working the night Alan Gillespie was killed? Yes, annoying. And Manslaughter checked cameras  from other businesses in the area. I hope so. They were this happened  because it was three blocks . Can we go to the part  I'll love? And they did not looked like us. He was just someone random. Who?! Anton Whiteley. It was in the neighborhood that afternoon. You love it? You know what? Yes. Shit. ¡Oye, Dawn! - Dawn!  - What? I was outside,  I borrow the master key? Could you lend me the master key?  Please Dawn. - Wait here.  - The master key, please, Dawn. Cass, are you okay? If I am fine. Do you want to have dinner? I ate earlier. There is pasta. Are you sure? Yeah, thanks, Mom. Single... - I'm crushed.  - It's okay. I thought you hated running. Hate even describe it. Need a moment?  Catching the breath? No no. What do you have? The result of DNA glitter  lip Cassie Malone's car. - Are you sure it was her?  - Yes. It was her lipstick  in the hotel room Cup. To start from scratch. Not exactly,  but thanks for rub. I'm glad to hear that. And nothing. - Goodbye!  - You should try swimming. It is better for your knees. The numbers are down this week. How much do you  get for this house? In this market? If you had already sold. Not as much as you want or need. Crowe was talking  with a type of homicide. How long...? - Hello.  - Hello. Give us a minute, friend. Come here. I met this woman yesterday. - Alexa.  - What did he want? He was asking about a dead guy. Yes, he also told me about it. I looked. He was killed in a hotel room. How sad. She has a grudge, honey. Loads of years, the past. From the past. Yes. Do you think you did? Calm. Your old can be a bit  tough on the outside, but never ... but I never killed anyone. Yeah, well, I wondered  where I was that night. What did you say? I said I was at  the beach house with you. - Yeah.  - Yeah, but you were not there. You left me there. - Yes?  - Yes. You said you had to  stay in town for something. Well, it 's where I should  have been then. It's okay? You are my princess. Production Seraphim are  proud to strive for excellence. My God, we should prepare  some toasted sandwiches, something rich and high in calories, right? What you think? Do you like the idea? Would you like a toasted cheese sandwich? Of course you want. Some of our team have been  in the family for decades Seraphim, growing and developing  together with us, like many  of our senior executives. Wait a second. He contacted the  detective Kieran Hussey. Leave a message after the tone. Kieran, the redhead found  the hotel room. He worked with Alan Gillespie. It is also dead. Rachel Isaacs left Seraphim just after  Alan Gillespie was killed. It hid. I think he fled scared  when Malone found. Or ... he was hiding  because she fired. It does not fit, clean. Why anyone reported missing? South Africa, single, no family nearby,  no one noticed missing. Malone killed her, okay? - Why?  - I do not know. But Seraphim Production  connects all three. Alan Gillespie, Rachel Isaacs and Malone. I heard nothing that says  Nikki Malone has done more to buy company shares. Did. You could come back with Alan's wife. How such a woman gets two guns  and pulls a body scrub? Answer those questions is your job. I'm just a piece of coal.  You are the diamond. Hey, you have the belongings  of Rachel Isaacs? Of course, they are bagged. - Can I see your computer?  - No, they have the technicians. The investigation into the murder  of Rachel has intensified now. Yes, because I told you about it. Madison have let the  computer Rachel for 24 hours. Let's go. He was encrypted? - Passwords and that?  - All that, yes. But I do not know why.  There is nothing interesting about it. Keep looking, there must be something. She definitely was  in that hotel room. And one or two emails - days before?  - Nothing between her and Alan. This will take a while.  Can we order food? I will not pay someone  to bring you burgers, There is food in the refrigerator. there had to be a hamburger. What did you find about Nikki? It is short of money. A large mortgage and income  of the club who have been a waterslide a couple of years. Any other connection  with Alan Gillespie or Rachel Isaacs? No. The only connection is Seraphim  and I could not find evidence that have ever  crossed himself there. Are you sure he's involved? Yes. You really went out and closed the chain? Go ahead, try. You're right,  it is charmingly boring. - It's crazy.  - All right. On June 20. 21, itself. If this was an adventure,  it's incredibly little sexy. It seems to speak in code.  "Many black angels". "Keep your strange gun safe  and forge the battle." "Yes, it is behind the spirit." What, playing video games? Back a moment. Behind the spirit ?? ??. - Do you want to...?  - They had an affair. ¡Alexa! - Hello, Carmel.  - What happened? - Can I have a moment?  - What happened? Just two minutes, I promise. I have to pick up my son. We were wrong about your husband. It was not common at all.  I need your help to prove it . Thank you. What do you do? What is this about? I have a crazy hunch. Let's go. This will show what  Patrick was doing. Your husband was a good man. # I'm alone # # Waiting # # To you # # I bailouts # You say you're not a cop,  but you act like one. Old habits. Do you want a drink? No thanks. Cassie, you know how did  your mother to make money? Yes, this place. He is an investor. He was selling drugs. An important. Is a lie. She would not do that. - Drugs killed my father.  - Yes it's correct. You have to hear this. I know you love your mother. I also know that lying to protect her. A few years ago, she invested heavily in a company  that makes airbags in Asia, and a couple of people  from the company discovered airbags that were defective  and were to report it . - Your mother learned.  - No no. Please wait. It would have taken his investment. He could not, was closed for six years. My mom is not a killer. I'll tell you what I think happened. On June 22 last year,  your mom made an excuse because I had to be somewhere else,  maybe something to tell one their boyfriends, whatever. But did you write  in your diary that was with you, because you were his alibi in case  the police come looking for her . Sucks  do that to your daughter, right? In any case, the police  never discovered the connection between her and the killings so far. He was going to lose your money. I have... I have to prepare myself. The club is about to open,  have to prepare. Good night, Mrs. Hi. - Where are you? You're good?  - Yes, excellent. Outside, exercising,  doctor 's orders. I've been playing with string. Are you still at home? I thought you were coming back. In short, it is impossible to lock. I saw a lot of video  on it, you can not. - Videos?  - Yes, of ?? how to ??. Enter without breaking the chain. I did the reverse. Wait, you've been ... for videos to  force entry into your computer? Yes. Do you think maybe you are  on a watch list? It was for work. Not officially. If I am arrested,  Kieran and you take me. True? There must be another way  out of the hotel room. Or ... the murderer was still in the room  when they cut the chain, which is ridiculous. - Or he was never there.  - What? Cool. That 's very kind  of you, thank you . - No problem.  - I will not take you there. Very nice tie, by the way. Thank you. There you go. Pimpollos. Mr. Russo, that wallpaper  is simply spectacular. - Can I see in this room?  - Yeah sure. - There you go .  - Thank you. Games do not have time now. No, I just went to wish  good luck to Cassie. It goes today, how exciting. Yes, thank you , but we need  more family friends. Yes, you need all  the friends you can. - Go, Alexa.  - No, you gotta see this. It's good. Es Carmel Gillespie, la esposa Alan. Mother of a son who deserves to know  what happened, what you did. This shit again. Because you were not with Cassie  on June 22 last year, You were in the room  next door where Alan Gillespie I was meeting with Rachel Isaacs. Because they would make public  the defective airbags and you could not let that happen. You have to go now. Not when it's getting interesting. Because you got  in the room next door and perforaste two holes in the wall. One to watch and one to shoot. The weapon was not very powerful,  but it had to be, right? Not at this distance. Rachel waited to  leave and shot him. Then, all you had  to do was clean. A pair of plugs  on the wall and that's all. I gave another 12 hours  to be elsewhere. You knew that he would send  a message to Rachel Isaacs If You put a bullet in Alan, and he did. But the you persecuted and  murdered anyway. No loose ends. It's a very entertaining story, but you have no proof. No jury will believe. I think they will. Because it was a good plan,  but not perfect. And those plugs were not the same color  of the room where you were, so, you had to improvise. And it was amazing what you did with  toothpaste and a guitar pick. You left something. And it's covered in your DNA. Nikki Malone, is arrested for the  murder of Alan Patrick Gillespie. Let's go. You can remain silent, anything you say can be used  against him in court. Well, the pressure dropped significantly. Even vitamin D level increased. Have you been more active recently? I've been from one side to the other, yes. Whatever you're doing,  keep doing it . It's good for you. Now, have you thought  about the other problem? My cousin is an excellent surgeon. Very annoying but  good with a scalpel. Unless it has  a sentimental reason to keep a piece  of metal on his shoulder. Well, as I said. It's my good luck charm. - There is a case.  - Oh no. A month ago, 8 cyclists set off  on his return from Saturday morning, but only 7 were returned alive to the goal. You have to like  a man with licra, right? - Roger Simpson. - Alexa. Solo Alexa. - Have you got a bike?  - Yes. - Come with us on Saturday.  - Why are you still single? I did not find the right girl. Hey, here's where your friend died? Roger loves  the demonstration of power. You're a resourceful man, Roger. I have nothing to hide.
