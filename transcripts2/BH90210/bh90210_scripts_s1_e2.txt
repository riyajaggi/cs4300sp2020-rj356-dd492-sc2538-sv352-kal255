 -Previously on BH90210... -That's my dress! This is the time to do a reboot. Wasn't Vegas enough punishment? And that was without Shannen. And I don't need acting advice from you. All you'll ever be is Brandon Walsh. We got a great relationship, the perfect marriage. Okay. -Is that my phone? -Mm-hmm. Andrea Zuckerman was my first crush. Hi, Brian.

 -Hi. -Do you know when Shay's new album is gonna drop? Any other questions... that do not involve my wife? Do you ever wonder what our lives would be like if we hadn't done that show? Every single day. I'm pregnant. Kel, are you okay? I heard Tara held you at gunpoint. Are you on diet pills again? We talked about this, Kel. Hey, if you go to that frat party, you're gonna get burned. You have to quit The New Evolution. They're brainwashing you. Students of West Beverly, I've just received word that Kelly Taylor was shot in the parking lot at LAX.

 It is shocking and sad, and this one goes out to her. Kelly's dead? Kelly's dead! Whatever, Mom. Lots of people dream about being back in high school. You don't need to be so dramatic. This whole reboot idea has me so freaked out. Right, 'cause being on a show where you get paid a zillion dollars is really that traumatic. It was traumatic, and it wasn't zillions of dollars, so why don't you ease up on the online shopping? Well, I think it sounds fun. I mean, how many people get -a chance at a do-over? -What is this? I was gonna tell you about that. Looks like a script. There is, um, there's an audition that I... It's just a part that I think I'm really right for. We've talked about this, Kyler. No acting. Conversation's closed. Okay, well, can we reopen the conversation? Sure. After your 18th birthday. Well, then, can I please have the script back? -I'll trade you. -What is that? I don't know. Came this morning. Have a good day. Yep. So he's actually going through with it? Mm-hmm. That makes divorce number three. -Up high. -Hmm. He wasn't good enough for you. Ladies. Welcome back to Fox. We're excited to hear your pitch. It doesn't seem very smart for me to leave my wallet at a crime s... So, why are we showing you this? Certainly not my proudest moment, and I don't plan on committing theft again, any time soon. But this video right here got five million views in 24 hours. Everyone wants to see the 90210 cast together, even after all these years. This is why we think that now is the time for a real reboot. Well, I love this idea. It's no secret, I'm a huge fan. I had an entire set of the cast dolls in middle school. Still haven't forgiven my mother for throwing them out when I left for college. I happen to have an entire set in my storage. I mean, it was the Christmas gift of 1992, wasn't it, Jen? Right up there with fanny packs. We'd love to do the show with you. -You would? -Really? All of you together again... it is too good to pass up. Too good to be true, I would have said. How'd you get everyone on board? Wh-When you say "everyone..." You do have them all, right? Well, we, uh... They wouldn't have come in with this pitch if they didn't. So, how soon can you get the whole cast in here? -Soon. -Ish. Uh, we're actually seeing everyone later today. Hi. Hi... oh. I love you, too. Thank you for all your support. Okay, can you stop being such a publicity whore? Why? It's what I do best. Look at this. It's like a red carpet. Yeah, with metal detectors. This is the perfect timing to pitch them the reboot afterwards, 'cause they're already feeling the love. Jennie, one with you and Jason? -Oh... Ah, sure. Looking good, Jen. You, too. A little puffy, though. You have Chinese food last night? Can't we just be adults about this? Mm. Can't you just take your hand off my back before I gouge your eyes out? Thanks. Good talk. Jason, can you sign this, please? - Hey, Z. Hey. - Hey, buddy. -Talk to Stacey about what happened yet? -Nope. Not planning to. At least not without a lawyer present. - There you go. - Thank you so much. - Anyone else? Hey, buddy. - Over here. Jennie, Jennie, over here! That is not the best picture I've ever taken, but... ...I'll sign it anyway. I love you, Brian. I'll sign that one... hey, how you doing? I'll sign this one... -Gabrielle! -Gabrielle! Gab. -What's her problem? -Wow. All right, guys, thank you. Larceny, destruction of property, public drunkenness, public urination. That is disgusting. Why would you assume that was me? You just love to mark your territory, don't you? Would you two just get a room? Your behavior is deplorable. You should all be very ashamed of yourselves. We agree, Your Honor. Well, fortunately for all of us, your defense attorney was persuasive enough... Your Honor? I object. ...to get the D.A. to drop most of the criminal charges. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Um, actually, can I say something? What is she doing? Babe, clamp it. I would like to state for the record that I acted alone, and none of my fellow codefendants should have to answer for my crime. Well, very honorable of you, but you can save that stipulation for the civil case with the owner of the dress, Mr. Johnson Deitz. I'm really sorry, sir, -that I stole your dress. -Mr. Deitz cannot comment, Ms. Spelling. But he will be seeking compensation in the neighborhood of $100,000. -Okay, now I object. -A hundred grand? You can't be serious. - That dress is polyester. - In addition, Ms. Spelling, you will personally return the dress in question to Mr. Deitz... - ...unlaundered. - Ew... Oh. -May I approach the bench? -No, you may not, and I am out of patience. So, for the remaining charge of larceny, the court sentences each of you to 50 hours of community service... What? ...and we are adjourned here. Thanks, Tori. Ugh, that was humiliating. Wait! Guys. I, I just wanted to thank you for being here. I-I mean, I know you had no choice because you were named in the suit... --...but it means a lot to me, and... -I'd like to make it up to you. -Oh, really? How? By doing all the community service work for us? That would be a good start. I was thinking more like a business proposition. We have a huge opportunity right now, and I want to talk to you about it, because we have a chance at a do-over. We could be great together. I mean, we were great together. Do you remember how great we used to be together? And we could be great again together. -Greatness can be ours. -She wants us all to do a 90210 reboot. What she said. Come on. -You can't be serious. -I am. And so is Fox. This could be huge. You saw all the fans up there waiting for us. And... there's money to be made here. This can be fun, too. -Guys? -Yeah. Please, guys, I need this. I-I stood up in court for you. - I took a bullet for you. - Oh, my God, - you shot the gun. - Yeah, I don't think so, T. The last thing I want to do is put on a Peach Pit uniform again. I'm getting a divorce. I got to prove my wife is cheating to trigger the fidelity clause in my prenup. I'm not signing any five-year contract if she's gonna get half. Bri? You want to get back - into acting, right? - Totally. You know what's super sexy? A middle-aged white rapper. I want to try for movies, Tor. Gab? We had fun in Vegas. We're in the courthouse because of Vegas. Hmm. And you'll never get Shannen. -Good luck, Tori. -See you in another 30 years. Yeah... we always knew it was a long shot. Come on. Hey, babe. What are you doing, exactly? I am strategizing how to get the rest of the cast on board for this reboot. Isn't this a little extreme? Extreme is the $100,000 in damages that we owe my creepster number-one fan. I have to make this reboot work. T, they said no. No never stopped my dad. Do you know what happened when he had this crazy idea to pitch a show about three sexy female detectives? No. What happened? They told him it wouldn't work, and he refused to take no for an answer. Wait, Charlie's Angels? Yep. 'Cause my dad was persistent. And sometimes he threatened to buy the studio. Obviously, that can't happen here. And clearly, money management... not genetic. He always found a way to make it happen. T, a show of this size would be almost impossible for you to manage. I mean, it's like fighting a forest fire with a garden hose. Are you saying that I can't do this? No. I'm saying that you're incredible. And you're amazing, but maybe producing isn't genetic. Okay, there's one thing I like about being pregnant. That we get a baby at the end of it? Was gonna say eating carbs. It's Tori. She won't give up on this stupid reboot idea. What's wrong with that? Reboots are hot right now. Playing Brandon Walsh again is the last thing I want to do. All right, come on, babe, let's think of the possibilities here. Brandon and Kelly back together. -People would eat it up. -Mm. Plus, a steady acting gig could be perfect. For all of us. You okay? Yeah, just, um... I just got a little nauseous. I'm gonna... I need some fresh air, okay? All right. Are you crazy? I told you you can't just come here. And you can't just ignore my calls; we need to talk. -I have nothing to say to you. -Maybe not. But you do have something I want. You're a publicist, you have connections. Do one thing for me, and your little secret stays a secret. Don't ever come back here again. Oh. You scared the crap out of me, Mom. Good. Your school called. Tell me you didn't go on that audition. I did, and I booked it. "Drunk cheerleader." It's really hard to play a good drunk, and I nailed it. Oh, please, I could do that in my sleep. -This isn't about you. -No. -It's about you and how grounded you are. -Mom! I said no acting. Not while you're under my roof. I feel you, Peanut. It's hard enough to be punished for being who you are, but for being who you aren't... But you're strong. You'll get through this. Now come on over here, give me some of that love. That was great, Brian. Nah, that blew. I didn't connect to the comedy at all. I mean, is this a comedy or is it a drama? This almost reads like it doesn't really know what it is. I'll share your thoughts with the writer. No, no, no, don't... I don't... I don't want to be rude, I just... Just being rude. So this is going great. -Can I do it again? -We're good. All right. Thank you for having me in. Thank you. How soon could you be in Atlanta? Welcome to the cast. What? Looking forward to working with you. Are you sure? Say hi to Shay. Can't wait to see what she comes up with. I will. Thank you. Lucky man. Not one single person has called me back. I am officially the worst producer -in the entire world. -Mm. Well, at least you're not the worst mother -in the entire world, 'cause that's my title. -Trust me, if they're mad at you, you're doing something right. I took away Emma's tablet for, like, one hour last week. She's still giving me 'tude. Oh, shoot, that reminds me. Okay... I have to change Declan's tutor from Monday to Friday. And that means I can put Emma's karate... Okay, field trip. Shoot. Sign the field trip form. Signed, dated, done. That's impressive. You know what would be impressive? Getting one phone call back. Super impressive? Getting the entire cast to sign on. But no, not one call. Producer fail. Okay, you know what, you've got to stop doing that. -What? What? Cooking? -No. Being so hard on yourself. Uh, look what you do. You keep six little people alive. That's not easy. No, it's not easy. In fact, most days it is like putting out a forest fire with a garden hose. -I got this. -What? Charlie just needs some angels. Right after I change this poopy diaper. -BRB. -Have fun with that. I know you want to distance yourself from this character, and I respect that. Why don't you have a membership here? I've been on the waiting list for, like, two years. -Ah. -I also know you want to focus on directing. Again, I respect that. You know, as a founding member, I could move you up on that list. Can you front my dues? Anyway, this is a big TV pilot, so a directing gig... pretty sweet. What, are you saying, if I sign on to the project, I could direct the pilot? If you could, would you reconsider? Well, it would definitely move the needle. I can talk to the network. I like the sound of that. Aw, congratulations. Oh... -Support her head. Support her head. -Hey, Gab, I've held plenty of babies. I'm gonna be holding my own soon enough. You okay? That stupid actor I punched... he's costing me jobs. Apparently, I'm not even allowed to direct myself anymore. Wait, you want to do the reboot now? If I can direct the pilot, sure. It'd be good for me, good for my family. Oh, I'm not gonna offer. You got to ask... nicely. All right. Gab, can you please pull some strings with the Actors Guild? I really need that little teenage douchebag to drop his complaint. I said nicely. I said please. I don't pull strings. But I do set up mediations. Love you. I know you do. Okay, you just better never touch another actor again, or I will beat the crap out of you. Yeah, I know. Sorry to lay all my problems on you when you have so much to be happy for. It's all right, I got my own troubles... Oh, my God, I'm kind of caught in the middle of something since Vegas myself. Oh, my God, did Jennie tell you? Tell me what? Jay, did you sleep with Jennie in Vegas? Well, we didn't exactly sleep. Look, it was a one-time thing. It was a drunken mistake. I guess Vegas was made for those. Wha...? Did you do something in Vegas? -Mm... -What did you do? I, uh... I kissed someone who... who was a woman. Oh... Wow. That's new. Well, Jay, it's not exactly new feelings. Well, I think that's great. But what made you, you know, this time? Like, why now? Just holding her. Wanting her to be her most authentic self and realizing what kind of hypocrite would I be if-if I didn't do that myself? Jay, I have been totally freaking out. The one person who I would normally talk to this about is the one person who's most likely to be hurt by this. All right, I know we've been here all day, but I'm a perfectionist, so one more time from the top. - And keep it sexy. Five, six, seven, eight. Go. I like this. Now sexy. Sexy. Yes. Here's our part, turn. Pop, pop, pop. Yes! So good. -Shay. -Feel it... Hey, Bri. Did you promise the producers of the movie a song if they hired me? Girls, take five real quick. You're not excited that we're gonna be in a movie together? Just answer the question, Shay. I answered the question, Bri. You wanted to be in the movie, and they wanted my song. What's the big deal? So they're doing you a favor by hiring me. No, it's not that blatant. Come on, you look good. You're a good actor. They probably were gonna hire you anyway. Come on, you're sexy. -They wanted you. What is...? -Stop it. Stop. Stop it. I don't want to do this right now. Bri, how is it that I did a good thing, and now all of a sudden you're looking at it as a bad thing? If I look like a chump because I can't get a job without my wife helping, that is a bad thing, Shay. Bri... -Can we talk about this, please? -We're done talking. I have to go pick up the girls now. Just do your thing. I'm sorry, girls. Let's just go from the top. All right. Five, six, seven, eight. Well, I'm glad this is working out, Jay. I think it's kind of flattering that the kid's condition for dropping the complaint is having you as a guest star -on his show. -Yeah, real flattering. Okay, just like we rehearsed. Rolling. And... action. Earth is an even sadder planet if you are the last line of defense. My defense is the best offense. -Whew! -Cut. Perfect. And scene. Hey, Jay, are you okay? We need a medic over here. Come on, we're gonna have to go to the hospital. Ooh, yeah. You have to go to the doctor. As soon as I get the feeling back in my coconuts. At least he dropped the complaint, huh? Guy's clearly got some issues. I guess he needed to work 'em out through his character, huh? That's gonna leave a mark. Oh, yeah. Yes. So I've been thinking about the reboot, -and if I'm gonna do it... -Yes! -I said "if." -Okay. I'd want to do things differently. All right, well, totally. I mean, Andrea doesn't have to be the frumpy nerd she was back then. I'm not talking about looks. You know, Tori, I'm talking about, like, inclusion and diversity. I don't know if you know, but back in the '90s, I wasn't even allowed to touch my African American TV boyfriend. I know. I know things have changed, but you know what, they haven't changed enough. We can do better. We need to do better. Okay. So what's happening with Andrea? I don't know. I was thinking maybe... maybe Andrea could be exploring her sexuality. Andrea's gay? No, she's exploring her sexuality. She's figuring it out. I mean, we could cast queer, we could do it right. I couldn't agree more. I think we should totally do this. Yeah? -Oh, Tori, yay. -Yeah. -Yay! -Okay. -Good idea. -Good, all right, good. I'm glad, 'cause that's what I think will work. Yeah, so I hired a tech firm. They set up some cameras around the house so I can catch her cheating. -I needed that for the divorce. -And you got it? Oh, I got it. In the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom, my McLaren, which is being detailed as we speak. I am so sorry. If she's gonna betray me after I was so good to her, after helping her build a brand and grow a business, it's on her. I'm moving on. Talk to me about this reboot. Really? Okay. We need you. I know. So here's the deal, Tor, now that I no longer have to focus on my backstabbing, cheating wife's businesses, I can focus on my own. -Okay, what do you want? -You. Our names on a line of health and beauty products. Ooh, our faces on the products. Not our faces, our names. The product has to be the star. NexGen by Ian and Tori. Oh, I don't love that. -Do you want me to be a part of this reboot? -Yes. Fall in love with it. So, congratulations on the movie. We're gonna work around your schedule. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm not doing the movie anymore. Why? They only wanted Shay. They didn't really want me. That's why you should do it. Show them they're wrong. Yeah, but are they? I mean, I don't know. I've been out of the game for a while. Maybe I just... maybe I don't have it anymore. At least Shay is trying to help you. I feel like the only thing Nate thinks I can produce are babies. Well, Nate's crazy. You are a force of nature. You, you see what you want and you-you get it. It's, it's really inspiring. Well, what I want right now is you. In the reboot. What I want... I want you in the reboot. Gabby's in. Brian's in. Oh, we are so close. I don't know how to tell you this. I'm out. -No. -Yeah. Wait, you're bailing on me? You're not gonna do the reboot? Kyler filed for emancipation from me. My own daughter wants a divorce. -What? -Yeah. I don't want this for her. I want her to have a normal life. I don't want her growing up in a fishbowl like I did. -What are you gonna do? -I don't know! I don't even know how to have a normal life. I'm not equipped for this. I can't even keep a marriage together. I just know that I want her to finish school. I want her to have all those things, go to prom, date real guys, not actor guys. --I don't know how to fix it, but I have to. And if that means staying home with her and not being on set with you for 14 hours a day, then that's what I'm gonna have to do. I respect that. You do? Wait, what, you're not mad? Oh, I am furious, but only because I can't imagine doing this without you. You are gonna be great. Look what you've already done. Now stop doubting yourself. While you're at it, stop playing with dolls. So you came to L.A. and you didn't even bother visiting me. - That's insulting. - I know. I'm so sorry, but duty calls. Well, I need my secret best friend. -Thank you for picking up. -Aw. You know that I love you, Bri. What's going on? Talk to me. Same thing I-I left on your voice mail. It's the Shay thing? -Yeah. -Hi. Hey! Stop! Okay, so you want my advice? Here it is. You got to let it go. I can't let it go. She deceived me. No, she did not. She was just trying to help you. This is not a reflection on her lack of faith in you. That's your own insecurity talking. You know what's annoying? The fact that you know me as well as you do. Let me give you an analogy real quick. I use decoys to attract mates for my rescues. -Now, is that deceptive? -Yes. Yes, it is, but is it also for the greater good? - Yes, it is. - Endangered birds deserve to continue their species, just like you deserve to continue your career. Thank you for your wisdom. -Oh, Tori's trying to reach you. -Me? I don't have time for that right now. Baby, I have got to go because I've got this sea lion who's not exactly cooperating right now, and he's got all these gill nets around. -May the Force be with you. -All right. Bye. Good job. Go. What are you doing here? How do you know where I live? -Star maps. -What do you want? Tori said you're not doing the reboot. I just came over to say I hope it's not because of me. You're not that important, Jason. You are very mean to me. Okay, it's... because of my daughter. She okay? No, she wants to be an actor. Oh, no. Exactly, yeah. I got to put an end to that. Well, if she's anything like we were at that age, she's gonna find a way to do it, whether you're on board or not. Okay, that's very reassuring. Thank you. Oh, I'm just saying, do you want her to think of you as someone who supported her dreams or someone who stood in her way? I want her not to repeat my mistakes. -She won't. -You don't know that. -Sure, I do. -How? 'Cause she's got you for a mother. Hey. I'm in. Really? Jen... On one condition. Kyler gets to be on the show. If she wants to act, I'm gonna have it be by my side. Keep her from doing all the stupid stuff we did. Yes, I think it's a great idea! Actually, Jason deserves the credit. Jason? Jason Priestley? Since when do you talk to him? -Are we gonna work or what? -Go. I was thinking, you're such a neat freak, you might actually get off on this. Hmm, if only you would fit in one of these bags. Oh, look, a hypodermic needle in a public park. How sweet. Let me get that for you. -Thank you. -Don't mention it. Oh, great, now we're thanking each other for picking up hypodermic needles. Yeah, I was thanking you for the parenting advice. It was surprisingly useful. Well, I'm glad, because I'm gonna ask you to return the favor soon. Camille's pregnant. Seriously? Wow. -"Wow"? -Uh... I'm sorry. I mean, congrats. Yeah, I didn't find out till after Vegas. Guys. I just, uh, want to take this opportunity and say thank you. I know it hasn't been easy... No, actually, it's been disgusting. Oh, is that a turkey carcass? Yeah, I'm sure it is, Brian. Griffith Park is overrun with wild turkeys. We're the turkeys for wearing these jumpsuits. You know what? This punishment does not fit the crime. Okay. Fine. Hate me for Vegas. But come on, you guys. Aren't you a little excited to do the reboot? I am. I'm so happy everyone signed on. - I like to consider myself loosely attached. - Okay. That's fine. But I do think we should all talk before we go to Fox. We really need an updated version. -90210 needs a face-lift. -I know I need a face-lift. Like, Gab and I were talking. Maybe Andrea could be exploring her sexuality. What, are you guys, like, you're talking story already? Uh... no, it-it's not what I meant. - Al-Although we did hire a writer. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't you think I should sit down with this writer? I mean, I am the director. What do you mean, the director? What... who made that decision? Me. I... I made that decision. - Because I'm the producer. - Okay, Ms. Producer, if people have demands, I have one, too. I need a brand relaunch. Natural integration of my solo entrepreneurial efforts. Okay, are you speaking English? Product placement. Whoa, whoa, hold on. I'm not letting you turn my show into a commercial. Excuse me. What are you talking about your show for? Since when did this become -your show? -When did any of this become your commercial? Okay, so, is that the way it's gonna be? 'Cause if it is, then I'm out. Wait a minute. How can you be out? - 'Cause I'm out. - This is not your show. You were never in in the first place. -Guys, guys, listen, guys. -You've got to be in before you can get out. Stop! Stop! You guys. Listen. We all agreed to do this for a reason. If there's something that's important to you, you can have it. Jen, - she wants her daughter cast in the show. - What? Nepotism, Jen? Didn't you learn enough lessons from Tori being on her dad's show? I'm right here. Jay's directing. -Gab's bi. -Andrea's bi. Z? You want product placement? It's all yours. - Bri, what do you want? Anything. - If we did this show for ten years, and we'll possibly do it for another ten, we should all be equal partners. -Creatively. Everything. -Agreed. We're all a team. But do you know what, you guys? If you guys all get something, I want something, too. Oh, boy, here it comes. - Group therapy. - What's that? - Just say it now. - Group therapy? -Group therapy? Are you kidding me? -No... -N-N-Not me, I'm not... -I don't need that. If there's anything... hey-hey-hey-hey. If there's anything this group needs, it's... - Medication. - Therapy. - We do need medication. - Oh, my God. How much can one person have? It's a nonnegotiable, guys. What do you mean it's a non-negotiable? -That's not true. -It's a non-nego... you... look at us! Here we go. Come on, guys. Oh, it's a... it's a photo shoot now? -Hey. -Here we are. Hey, guys, game time. -Nice to see you. -Good to see you. -How are you? -Good to see you. -Hi. -Hi. -Very nice to see you. -Good to see you. -Hi. -Hi. Thank you. - Hi. - Shannen's delayed -in Africa. -Well, this is a real thrill. Seeing the whole gang back together again. Well, it's a thrill for all of us, too. Uh, as a token of our appreciation, we brought you - a little gift. - Thank you. That is amazing. Before we get started, we would like to introduce you to a new executive who will be running the show day-to-day. In fact, you all know her. I'm sure you all remember? Holy Emily Valentine. I definitely remember you. Maybe therapy wasn't a bad idea. So hello, everyone. It's so great to see all of you. And thank you so much for showering after that whole garbage pickup thing. And the pictures at TMZ, awesome. Way to rock that vest, Tori. Oh, thanks. And I think therapy is a great idea. I think each and every one of you should explore your narcissism, your neuroses, your pathological self-absorption. Embrace it. It's gonna make great television. Um... thank you? This is gonna be so... much... fun. What do you want to talk about, Mom? When you said you wanted to get into acting, I couldn't really separate my experience from what yours could be. -I got scared. -Of what? Of how it could affect you. Now and 20 years from now. Look, I know you think you're ready for this, but the reason for that is because you have no idea what you're getting into. -Well, Mom, I... -And the reason for that is because I shielded you. I don't want to be the person that stands in the way of your dreams. Are these the emancipation papers? Mm, no. I shredded those. This is a contract for a recurring role -on the 90210 reboot. -What? Really? -Mm. -But... I thought you said... If I'm going to protect you, I've got to prepare you, so that means I'm gonna tell you all about how it was for me. Every last gory detail. And if, after that, you still want to do this, then we'll sign the papers. We'll do it together. Deal. So this talk, how long you thinking, like, 15 minutes? Couple hours? -Could be days. -Okay. So buckle up, baby. Here's to 30 years. -Mm. -30 years? Are we that old? Not me, just you. Here's to Friday date nights. Every one better than the last. -Mm. -What's the matter? Oh... this. You know me so well. This is exactly what I needed. I would be... I'd be so lost without you. Well, then, it's a good thing I'm not going anywhere. I want to tell you something. -It's about the reboot. -Mm. I've decided to do it. Really? Part of my agreeing to do it is having Andrea explore her sexuality. It's an important story for me to tell. I think that's great. It's high time. Good for you. I want to tell you why it is so important to me. Okay, I stalked you, but I couldn't wait to talk to you. Listen... you were right. I am so sorry about overstepping with your audition. Please don't be mad at me. I'm not mad at you. I've been, I've been thinking about it, and, uh, you were just trying to help. -I'm sorry. -I was, but I'm gonna stay in my lane from now on. -You got a lot going on. -Yeah. So, are you excited for the reboot? Yeah. Yeah. I-I mean it's gonna be a, a big change, you know, I'm not, not gonna be around as much as I'm used to. Might have to hire my own assistant. As long as you don't try to take one of mine. --Never. I wouldn't even think about poaching one of your assistants. Call my agent and have him hook me up. I'm sorry. -I love you. -I love you. It's really coming together. We got the cast on board. Jason's meeting with the writer tomorrow. The network's excited. And... I know you think I can't do this, but... I actually know I can. And it has n... It has nothing to do with the money. It's because I'm passionate about it. And I'd just... I'd really like you to support me on this. And I know it's not gonna be easy. Babe? Really, Tori? How much food can one woman possibly eat? Hey, Doc. What's the good news? -Well, your set injury caused no permanent damage. -Yeah, that is good news. -But I did discover a preexisting fertility issue. -What? Yeah, conceiving children is possible, but it will require significant medical intervention. Fertility issue? What are you talking about? -Jason. -What? Jack Carlisle. Great to meet you. I can't explain how excited I am to be writing the pilot for the reboot. -What's that now? -The reboot. A friend of mine reached out to the network, who put me in touch with Tori Spelling. I'm the new writer. Oh. Uh, take a seat. Doc, I'm gonna have to call you back. -You want a drink? -Yeah, I'd love one.
